Laid up in my bed and I'm tired af. Good day ♡ 
Amen. 
No more. 
Vegas turnup was too real! 

You already know. Haha! 
Why the fuck am I laying down like I ain't got shit to do????
If I die tomorrow, thank you to all the real ones who have fucked with me, loved me, and supported me these last few weeks. I needed that. ♡
I hate that I can only push myself to do so much in my day before I literally give up. I'm not a quitter but how much can a person take?
Nothin was ever mine, not my husband, our privacy, our life, not even my ring. It was nvr about me. It was never about us. Just every1 else.
Nvr again will I put myself in a position like this. Let every1 else put u on a pedestal, tell u that u did everything right. I know better.
Hurts at first til the reality sets in that this is what that person does. It's nothin new, just magnified when u see it for what it is.
Try 2 do sum'n nice for sum1 n they turn around n throw it back in ur face, putting the blame on u bcuz they were irresponsible....smh.


I'm just me..... #sorrynotsorry 
When someone don't like me it doesn't really bother me. The way I see it is that's their issue, not mine. Bitch, I like me. Haha!
Been way too on with the benzos n the alcohol the past few days. Really gotta slow it down.
I had a fun ass Thirsty Thursday with good company but why the fuck is my shoulder blade bruised??????
The longer you stay unhappy with yourself, the longer you continue to treat others in a way that reflects how you feel about yourself.
Before u talk about me, look at yourself in the mirror. I don't judge ur ass so don't fkn judge me.
U can give ur all 2 sum1, luv em unconditionally, try'n c the good in em, but try n do sum'n 4 urself n watch em sit back n judge ur ass.
Feels like ain't nuthin real to anybody anymore. Fuck it, tho.

Slow internet and slow computers make me homicidal.
They say sleep is a sign of depression, all I wanna do is sleep and have a love affair with my bed.
At the end of the day, I have myself to blame.
Initially I'm a hard person to get to know. Once you know me, I think you either love me or hate me. There's no in between.

Shit always starts out good n then little by little nothing was the same.....
Sum people r just really good at making u feel like ur worth sum'n n sum people r really good at making u feel like u aren't. Choose wisely.
Sometimes all I want is not to feel.
No matter how many times I look in the mirror, I will never be 100% satisfied with what I see....

@Doonk7 @DrJennBerman @F1abraham you can see it by how she speaks to everyone. There's a reason she is on that show alone.
@holt_kristi @DrJennBerman @F1abraham 1 would hope that it would be mandatory 2 research that before going on the show. She's the angry one.
She always had an entitled attitude with everything her parents did for her, and was forever UNgrateful for all their help.
Watching #CouplesTherapy n thinking maybe @DrJennBerman has never watched Teen Mom. @F1abraham was always so disrespectful to her parents.
Watching #CouplesTherapy n I gotta say, some guys don't have no problem disrespecting their girl or making a fool outta her; but they learn.

Watching Kevin Hart....scene has me thinking....random fact. I hate fkn liars who lie just because. FOH with that shit.
Just posting #randomfacts about me today. ^-^
When I know I gave 100% to someone or something, I don't feel bad when it ends. I leave knowing I gave all I could give. Clean conscience.
I stay content w/ knowing that not much lasts 4ever n what's meant 2 B will surely B no matter what I do or don't do 2 make it happen.
When sum1 is miserable n lonely they r desperate 2 do anything 2 make themselves feel better or relevant. Like tryna fk up what u got.
Random bitches posing as friends.
I'm a loyal type a person but if someone is disloyal to me, they will never have 100% of my loyalty ever again. #fact
On another note, thank you to my baby boy, my jody my jody, for the KFC. : )
I feel soooo agitated and irritable, I don't know why!!!!! Fuuuuuuck!
@TheRealRoseanne I love you! I still watch every episode of Roseanne that comes on!
Just got done watching House at the End of the Street....good fuckin' suspense thriller. O_o
@SupaSupaMcNasty yea she's a cutie!
@SupaSupaMcNasty she's my daughter's bestie. Lol.
@SupaSupaMcNasty she goes to Lick she said she's friends with u. She's a freshman.
@SupaSupaMcNasty your friend Faith is at my house right now, lol.
I know it's almost winter but I miss the tanning bed. Someone buy me a membership so I can glow year round!
I have the worst cramps, whoever cross my path today better be on their best behavior cause I'm that bitch today. Grrrr.
The days I just wanna come straight home from work I get stuck doing the randomest shit. Fml.
Ugh why do I sign up for bullshit????
"If you don't come home and immediately either take your pants off or change into pajamas you're living life wrong." I DO THIS FA REAL.
I never know which mirror is lying to me, dammit!
I need to get my ass back in the gym. I have no motivation when it's cold. All I want to do is wrap myself up in a blanket and be a burrito.
@kanyewest no one cares.
Bitch got everyone doin all the work, talkin bout "I love it here." Bet'chu do.
I'm so fucking tired!!!! I'm bout ta sleep good and can't wait for my 3 day weekend so I can whaaat? Sleep in, yeeeaaaa!

: (
Help me, Forrest.
Ughhh I'm being so lazy today. Someone get me up outta this nice warm bed!!!!
Yep I spent $78 on myself today. Pretty sure that's it for me until Christmas is over. #mommyproblems
Feeling tired and cranky. Wah. &gt;=《
I wanna be in an altered state right now. Reality is my nemesis n I could use a little fantasy, baby....<BLACK HEART SUIT>
Pretty sure I have ADD. I hate not being able to focus. Fuck man.
I think it's funny how these youngsters having babies r naming their daughters Molly. U know that name wasn't cool then n it still ain't.
I laaa laaa laaahv my wild hair....<BLACK HEART SUIT> 
Stop it. My new obsession phrase. Oh well.
I guess if all these kids actually behaved, I wouldn't have a job. So let the fuckery continue! Lol.
Watching American Blackout on Nat Geo.... this shit is scary as fuck.
Mmmm....the aftermath. <BLACK HEART SUIT> 
Uff. That is all.
Sometimes I just don't know.
@Kafani : (
It's crazy to think we have never really seen ourselves in our true form...only a reflection through… 
Why has it been so long.....why has it beeeeen....

When females don't like another female its mistaken 4 jealousy when all it is, is #bitch #icu and you ain't slick. #intuition. Get u some.
If you continually make a fool out of your significant other, they will eventually make one out of you. #respect
I fkn can't stand needy bitches. Learn how to stand on your own and stop making yourself look dumb as FUCK over some dude u ain't gonna get.
The crazy train has taken off. Just another average day at work. #cray #5150
"I keep doin the same stupid shit but let me tell you how to run yours." Dumbass dummies. Goofy and misguided as a motherfucker.
It's irritating as fk when ppl whose own lives are a Jerry Springer episode wanna offer advice or words of "wisdom". Thanks but no thanks
Wish you would learn to love people n use things.... and not the other way around. #NWTS <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Common sense people. It's not as common as you think.
I will never understand people's inability to use a sign in/sign out sheet. Fkn Name, Date, Reason for visit, and Time In or Out! #idiots
My dogs are crae. That is all.
Late late breakfast and coffee run with my baby....downtown bound later for some dranks n hip hop. Happy Saturday!  <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Isn't it amazing how u talk all this shit n we still lack communication, how beautiful our kids would be n I don' need convincing....#NWTS <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Awww just got the sweetest compliment from a lil ol lady @ Kaiser, said my hair is very beautifully done n she luvs the 2 tone look. #roots
Woke up late twice this week, vacation was fun but did me in. Can't wait to sleep in this weekend. Oh. Yeah.

Tanning, gym, n whaaaat? Luggage shopping for my Hawaii trip, yeeee! 4 more days, boyyyyyyy!
A few months ago I wasn't really sure that I would ever feel the same way I used to. I was ready to give up. Thank you for proving me wrong.

Oh the idea is so fun everytime....
U used to say "U can be whoever you want, even yourself...." yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself. Swangin'.
Barely slept 3 hours last night n I'm feeling that shit 2night. I'm beyond exhausted but because I'm blessed I'm bouta sleep real good. ^-^
How come every time I drink, I feel so fuckin fat the next day? Feels like I have a beer belly n I don't even drink beer. Fkn bloated ass.
And I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it, if it's one thing, I am worth it....
Aaaaaand I'm out! 
"Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make loooove...."
I also think it's nice when females compliment you at a club / bar instead of acting like some haters. I like that shit.
It's nice when I go to a bar n they ask "You ARE 21, right?" Ummmm, yea. Lol.
#ThirstyThursday to do or not to do? Thinking about going down....town, that is.
I fuckin hate everybody dude. Fuck all y'all.
t '-' t.
"Ppl r funny, u don't even know about the shit that I been thru; just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple."
I'm callin 1-800-BAD-DRUG. Fuck this.
Why do these benzos turn me into a raging bitch? The whole point of taking em is to calm my ass down. Makes me wanna choke a bitch. Grrrrr.
Scratching an itch with fake nails fuckin SUUUCKS!
You never know how important it is to have a working radio in your car until you don't have one. Never fear because I fixed that bish! Yee!
Fuck I just wanna get outta here. Someone come the fuck back so I can take my lunch break fuuuuuuuck!!!!!!
I hate when I have a meltdown. Crying is not my thing.
@SupaSupaMcNasty thanks love ^-^
Feeling like giving up lately. I wish things would get better.
I've been addicted to bananas in the morning.
@ochocinco bullshit u lie
Gotta love comin home to bullshit.
"No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that, fuck a fake friend, where ur real friends at?"
"Ima worry bout me, give a fuck about you..." #Drake 
It sucks when someone knows ur goin thru some shit n constantly chooses 2 continually drain u with their issues. It's disappointing at best.
How is it possible to feel this tired? I could sleep for a week straight if only someone let me. x_x
How can I complain, in exactly 3 weeks from today, I will be on the #beach in #Hawaii. Yee!
My baby boy treated me to Panda Express n Starbucks after a long hard day. This week has been hard but thankfully it's almost over.
2. More. Days. I need the weekend to come already. Not so I can turn up. Not so I can get down. Just so I can sleep in.

Who thought it was a good idea 4 Stockard Channing 2 play a high school student in Grease? She looked in her 40s back then. Jeff Conway too.
"But when it falls apart I'm always down, to pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground...."
Most guys r just dicks draggin around a body; don't give credit where it's not due. If he don't <BLACK HEART SUIT> u, wife u, or make u better #ByeFelicia
So tired &amp; grateful 4 my bed. I hate 2 leave it every morning. Sometimes it's all I think about. It's a love affair. Yup. It be like that. <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Why they do @Kafani like that? Dang. Shit is messed up. O_o
A yr ago 2day I sat in a hospital, holding my dad's hand as he took his last breath. It was the worst day of my life. I'll never forget it.
"@TPAIN: You ever think about deleting all your social media accounts and just worry about living in the real world? #IsupportTpain" Ugh yes
I feel like shit today. Didn't even try to get out the bed this morning. Think this is gonna be a tough week for me. #rip Dad...I miss you.
@iAmTooCold "We way past cakin', like pie..."
H-A-W-A-I-I bound, baby. Countdown. 
This fucking day blows already.
One month til Hawaii!!!! 
"You say I'm old news, well who da new star?" #drizzy
I wish my kid WOULD tell me "don't do any stupid shit" while sitting in the school office. There'd be some CPS n an ass whoopin involved.
Exactly one month til Hawaii! I am beyond happy to be sharing this experience with so many loved ones! We boutta fuck shit up! ; )
@SupaSupaMcNasty I love u kid, don't stress.
@SupaSupaMcNasty she loves you so much, trust me. She shows her shit in a crazy way lol.
@SupaSupaMcNasty its part of why we love her.
@SupaSupaMcNasty he was a lot like ur mom but now that he's gone I look back and I laugh. Its life. Ur mom does try she just has her issues.
@SupaSupaMcNasty yes but I had issues w/ my dad n u know what, he's gone now n all I remember is the good things.
@SupaSupaMcNasty trust me I survived a whole lot I never thought I could but I did. It made me better and stronger.
@SupaSupaMcNasty I know hon but that's right now....everything seems hopeless when we are at our lowest. I promise you it's not.
@SupaSupaMcNasty it gets better honey, I promise you. Not easier, but better. <BLACK HEART SUIT>

Its been too long, "bitch I'm goin in, I'm goin in, I'm goin in, I'm goin in...." Haha fk this waiting around shit, boiiiiii!
If something doesn't go your way, just take it as a sign that it wasn't meant to be....
"And bitch, I'm mac may-yay-yay-yane..."
Had an amazing weekend despite a small downfall but when you're surrounded by people who love you I guess nothing else really matters. ; )
I've learned that if someone can't be real with themselves, you can't expect them to be real with you. #realtalk #truth
Bbq downtown today, yee! Hope this heat doesn't kill me!!!
I'm sooooooo fkn tired. Got a busy weekend ahead of me, luckily it's all fun, no business. Feel like tanning and gettin my nails did tho....
"@lnsaneTweets: Having cute dresses but nowhere to wear them &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" cuz I never go anywhere!!!! Grrrr.
Fuck a hug, I wanna hit!
But my pimp hand is strong right now. Lol. Grrrrrr.
Then when you finally hear from them you don't know whether to slap the shit outta them or hug them to death. Yep it be like that sometimes.
I def have that mom mentality like when ur kid is late. First you anticipate, then get irritated, then pissed, and worry is always last.
Mindfuckin ass. &gt;. &lt;
I'm starting to get worried. Omg omg omg omg. Wtf.
U ever be in the middle a something n someone wanna come talk ur ear off? U ever wanna just say "STFU, you!"? Yea. Havin 1 a those moments.
Last thought for the night...#ByeFelicia
Right now my biggest worries are how I'm gonna drag my ass out of bed tomorrow and what I'm gonna wear cuz its boutta be hot as fuck. &gt;_&lt;
And I don't smoke but it sure feels like I'm high. Good god, wonder what they put in this stuff????

So much stress n anxiety, I really hate this feeling n wish it would go away. Life just steadily been fuckin me up lately. I hate'chu Jody!

"do u ever just make scenarios in your head that will never happen but makes you so happy so you just keep on imagining them" ALL THE TIME!
And I fkn hate that Twitter makes me spell all kinds of stupid due to the limited amount of shit I can talk. Lol. Hella feels like jr. high.
2day is 1 a those days I could really just snap on someone. I have low tolerance 4 bullshit of any kind. Today is a day meant 4 me n my bed.
Hella shoulda stayed in bed...not feeling this day at all. At least I get a workout in. I really just want to close my eyes to the world....
Well shit...plans switched up, it's a BBQ downtown then.....yee!
Craving a Starbucks. Contemplating swim or workout today...I could realllly use both but do I wanna be sweaty n cute or sweaty n cute? Lol.
I hate when people stare. Fkn say something or look away. Ain't nobody got time for awkward ass eye contact. Speak. Holla.
Well fuck you too then. t x_x t

I guess DeAnza Park is the place to be during lunch hour....everybody got their lil piece of shade taken....
Gotta good workout in, I'm bouta sleep damn good 2nite. Then again, I sleep damn good every night! #iain'tgotnoworries :-)
Time for the gym, time to get it in....

Bored havin fun with my camera.... #selfie #sunday 
@KevinHart4real is that before or after you gave her the loooong diiiick? I saw your FB post. Lol.
If I turn this TV on I'm be stuck like Chuck n lag on getting up. Having an internal battle of Lazy Sunday &gt; Getyoassup n do sumthin Sunday.
Cause when ya look good, ya feel good. And I'm not getting any younger, ayyye! 
And there's no m'fkn way I'm tryin' harder than you. #shitidontdo
Fact. I get annoyed easily, doesn't take much 2 irritate me or piss me off. If that makes me an asshole, so? I ain't here to impress you.
"@Facts_Guide: If you sleep on the left side of the bed, it makes you happier and more positive." Hmmmm, it's all makin' sense now.
@iHustleNation Yes! Finally someone gets it.
Thinkin bout goin 2 the @LilTunechi, T.I. &amp; 2 Chainz concert next weekend....if I can find cheap tix. I've already seen Tip n Weezy but.....
Gymin' and swimmin' today....and tanning cause it's a must....#teamfeelgood
Confusion, happiness, excitement, fear. Its all the same rite now. Each feeling overwhelms the other yet feels exactly the same as eachother
"@Facts_Guide: Couples who don’t have a TV in their bedroom have 50 percent more sex" Hmmmmmm????
Social media suuuuucks....too bad we're all addicted lol.
Ughhhhhh....c'mon man I need to get up n move. I'm stuck like Chuck to this bed. Need some a that good o' motivation. : /
Beauty is most definitely in the eye of the beholder....
Don't get me wrong, looks aren't everything! Personality can make a person shine, no doubt. We all possess beauty of some sort.
I'd rather have a pretty face n a decent body, than a perfect body n a hurt ass face. We can always work on our bodies.
Words fail me sometimes I need a push or a shove....
Where's a Drake Quote when I need one????
All the sudden it's mass confusion. /: (
"@Facts_Guide: When yelling while arguing with someone, you are more likely to mess up a word." &lt; I do this for real!

Ate like a fatass today... : (
Watching #BeingMaci and I think Dalis is a shit starter. And Ryan is a hypocrite. That's all.
Worse than being a mom....being a taxi driver. How'd I get so lucky in being both? #sarcasm
Ok last #selfie of the day, promise. Lol <BLACK HEART SUIT> 
Tanning kinda day....

I'm not a ppl person but I'm a ppl reader...if I known you for yrs I know all about u, even things u don't think I do. Mannerisms, quirks...

We're all broke in some way...if we weren't we wouldn't have to pick n choose where to spend our money. We'd all have everything we want.

@dmjninety6 thanks :-)
I'm ready to throw in the towel. Ready to stop caring. Ready to not feel anything. Cuz sometimes it's just too much.
He said he don't see my heart
I tell him "Feel my pain and look again"
Generally speaking when we stop chasing u all the sudden we become most wanted. Not speaking for myself, just a random thought. #girltalk
Truth is I'm beginning to see that men need just as much attention as females if not more.

Good night world....

Cause in the end who really gives a fuck what everyone else thinks?
We will see.... 

Sometimes when u feel like ur ♡ is breaking just remember like any injury, when the heart breaks, it also heals. I think I'm gonna be ok. :/
Baby steps 2 healing. Moments of weakness don't make u a weak person. I'm surrounded by ppl who love me n that's what's gonna get me thru <BLACK HEART SUIT>

It's gonna be one of those days I'ma have to drag my ass outta bed. Feeling so down, why is it so hard to be happy? Vacation sucked. : (
Sometimes giving up is all you want to do but somebody always needs you to be strong. Emotionally I'm a fkn champion bodybuilder.
Random ass dreams and nightmares lately....on another level my head is so fucked up these days....
Give yourself the respect you deserve when he won't. #walkaway #dontlookback #K.I.M.
Downtime is the worst time. But when I realize that one that DOESN'T have my back is the only one who should, I remember why I'm doing this.
When you believe in people, you know u take a huge chance of getting let down. How come it surprises the hell out of us when it happens?

@iHateKatStacks You having a past doesn't excuse your present and future behavior. Do sumn positive and post that on YouTube.

@iHateKatStacks oh but u like that, right? U said u love it. Sad n sorry soul, smh.

@missnatalienunn Yep I'm a Capricorn girl wit a Cancer man, n I've never been happier!!!!
Breastfeeding a 5 year old ain't "healthy". Get a breast pump nasty ass!
Breastfeeding should be for babies who can't feed themselves. After that, it should be illegal (to have a 5yr old at your tit. Perversion.)
@missnatalienunn I say soon as the kid got a tooth it should be a wrap!
And I say it should only be for tiny infant babies...after that, no.
I say if you fuck dudes n drink for a living, u ain't a star, u just a sad n sorry soul.....
:-(
@HOTTSAUCE Freddie u gon' fly away!!!!!
Hmmmmm.....no that's not a hummer.
Who agrees that "exposing" is the same as snitching????
