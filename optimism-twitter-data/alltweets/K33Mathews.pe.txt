The tweet about living like Christ wasn't aimed to anyone in particular, but if the shoe fits it fits.
I swear Wyatt and my first house is going to be in the country away from the world.

I strongly dislike COD, it makes me not have a husband for a month!!! <UNAMUSED FACE><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Fun fact: God wrote the ten commandments with HIS OWN FINGER, if they are that important to him, then why not follow them!
