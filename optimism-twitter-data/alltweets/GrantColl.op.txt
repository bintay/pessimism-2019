@TomEnglishSport @Seanoward4 @CelticGossip yes when 1 line judge was clearly seen saying "it's a pen..hit his hand"
@Omertagrazie @piersmorgan afraid not..he's actually Irish believe it or not
Ireland has given the world some fantastic gifts, but by God they do owe us one for inflicting us with war monger @piersmorgan
@piersmorgan tell you what , we'll quite happily pay for our share of trident..if you take them down there, it's your turn
I know we slag some daily papers...but really @TheEveningTimes has become a paper that absolutely hates Celtic with a passion..quite scary
@Martin1Williams @NicolaSturgeon why does that matter? It's not a presidential appointment...it's a party
Just phoned my mate raging at @piersmorgan attacking Scotland...hope piers wasn't too offended when he listened
@hannahcoyle15 your mood changed quickly
@piersmorgan @JMivule hahaha stick your nuclear weapons next to England's biggest city, then see how quickly opinions change
@piersmorgan @NCusack_ are you too thick to realise..we use them...we're all dead war monger
@carolk23 @ClinMick that's what Michael Douglas thought...he wasn't in the follow up film

@AngelaHaggerty we lost a treble...but hey..at least the treble we lost was not.
Our club.
Our history.
Our Dignity

If we had a decent RB we'd still be in the cup....sold 2 of the 3 goals...still pinning for ledley
Still no excuse for our forward players playing so shite yesterday...and as for Mathews...Get him tae feck
@mchalepilar hahaha
See when the GB make bad decisions @celticfc immediately release 5 statements,inform police and criminalise them..yet let @ScottishFA off
Hahaha #BruceJenner is turning into a woman and is doing it through a reality series...these fuckwits will do anything for publicity
@piersmorgan @_AyushS @astonvilla @Arsenal you're a war monger ...we don't want your type voting for us
@Rocknrollstar13 I'd sign him
Is Danny Wilson signing for us? Could do worse need cover in CB role
@deboraahxo hahahahahahahahaha tad harsh
Western powers in denial ...we have created the refugee crisis by bombing the shit out of their lands..and leaving lawless state behind us
@phillyceltic we where shite....ref was a cheat
If anybody has had the misfortune of going to a charity lunch with an ex pro referee telling"humorous" stories says it all @gerrymcculloch1
The very fact @UKLabour will criticise the #SNPMANIFESTO ....tells you the very reason Scotland is turning it's back on the party
Despite my anger and disappointment yesterday...the @ICTFC tweets where very funny .....today


@iainmartin1 Nuremberg? Wow you really are a nasty bigoted piece of shit
Not sure @BorisJohnson should be putting parliament and babies in same sentence these days...truth is out BoJo  #Westminstercoverup
Glad we got knocked oot anyway...diddy cup...was going to conflict with #Eurovision anyway <SMIRKING FACE>
@MeneerPrismatic yes seen it on here
Personally I don't want Inverness player banned retroactively.it's done ..not his fault ref cheated..guy probably won't get to another final
@ScottishFA @ChampionsLeague @AS_Monaco @juventusfcen @UEFAcom @juventusfc I'd seriously advise you not to big up refs today
@piersmorgan @DailyMail I'll read it before giving you stick..hopefully not full of cliches
Just drove past that crash on M8.hope it looks worse than it is
@Harky83 @CelticGossip definitely
Alan Muir is an anagram of am a hun.....True dat
Sounds like a really bad crash on the M8 thoughts go out to all involved
@CelticGossip that shit only happens if your called souness
Does this mean I have to become abieber
@CelticGossip haha they've even less money than us
@CelticGossip easy enough loan players...but need someone to take donkeys on decent wage...Will not be easy to shift
Seriously! WTF 
Fully expecting sob stories about McLean from the press now....shite like..
"police have offered advice in his safety"
"guy doing his job"
@RaeComm @NicolaSturgeon was it a civilised discussion? Or what the press want England to believe
I wanted the treble...no doubt, but as long as the league flag flies over Celtic Park every season, I'll be a happy chappy #Celtic
What kind of church in govan burned down last night?
I think they might have to move the final to lesser hampden now
Really hope #Inverness win the cup now..big Yogi is one of the sports good guys
@Ryan8867 for me the only decent performance yesterday was from wee Forrest
@Ryan8867 our players were like bambi on ice..slipping all over the place...you test your studs before..clearly never did that
@Ryan8867 I'm not denying the refs a cheating BASTARD...but I'm also not blind that most in a Celtic top never turned up
@Ryan8867 why do players go out to test the pitch...if it's not to test their boots?
@Ryan8867 he was completely shite yesterday
@CelticGossip @celticfc should also look in the mirror..most were absolutely honking
I see Leigh Griffiths doing his talking in the papers again...maybe ha should look in the mirror too...1 of the worse players on the park
See when our players go onto the pitch to check the pitch..Are they to busy keeping their cool looking boots clean instead of testing studs
AC Milan are absolutely honking these days
Outrageous @ScottishFA .you going to demote McLean for that shocking decision...he should've booked the baw for trying to get a guy sent off
@Johnny_Scotland totally agree..and LG up front would've given shite a bad name
@Johnny_Scotland true...but its the truth...shocking .Just brought nothing to the table today
Refs a cheating bastard...but make no mistake...our so called big players truly fucked off before a ball was kicked
Commons..awful.
Griffith..awful.
Johansen..awful.
Bitton ..awful.
Mathews...awful
Adam FUCKING Mathews ....what a prick
Job done @ScottishFA <THUMBS UP SIGN> you cheating cheating rats
@MeneerPrismatic always hope
@MeneerPrismatic overall useless today
LG showing exactly why we need a new forward this summer
Just don't get the Biton love in....guy can't run..can't head the ball..and can't tackle ...great player
Get Commons Aff bloody useless today
With commons on taday we're playing with 9 men
Mathews is FUCKING useless
With officials in Scotland as biased as we have.....it's a miracle we've won any trebles at all
5th officials are as much use as a submarine in the Sahara desert
@auld_guy in the house
Wee Forrest looks the only player up for it so far
We've started sluggish
Not going to Hampden...as I'm a feckin jinx at that ground
#GlobalCitizenEarthDay 
What a shite game this is #ChelseaVsManchesterUnited
@madbhoab I think he had a bad injury...and never regained his place ...madness
@madbhoab actually think they'd be the perfect partnership
@madbhoab I like Jerome...but the guy has the magic touch
I honestly can't believe #Norwich don't start with Hooper guaranteed if the guy was a regular starter he'd be their top scorer by 10 goals
@Argentinaceltic no ....but willing to change my mind if I see it up close
#ScotRiots FUCKING 30p FUR A FREDDO BAR!
Right I'm off to the @Brazenhead1888 ya gits

Imagine the terror everyone in the plane..esp school kids,went through watching a pilot trying to break into cabin in a dive #Germanwings
@MrsRoyKeane @BG1954 yeah not buying taking everyone with him...sounds like he was thinking very clear
@ClinMick yes seems that way
@ClinMick listening now...pilot's have a code to get in...unless person in cockpit pressed the denied button
