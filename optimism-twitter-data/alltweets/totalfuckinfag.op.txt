I'm definitely sleepy
I remember learning about the period blood in the spaghetti bs as a kid. I love spaghetti, why would I do that to it?!
IM CRYINGGGG <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But then when I do get a lot of friends I'm the weird one who barely ever talks so...I have books and a gf who sits with me while I read
I try to have friends and it never works out. My personality kinda awesome but then they wanna date me and well that part...<CONFUSED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>

Then wonder why ya'll in love after…
here go Mook cuttin up on snap lol
My upper back is just <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm still learning how to accept and love unconditionally without fear
Back, why you gotta hurt like this? What did I do to you?! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
As I'm growing I see the way I love growing. I look back on all the ppl I thought I loved and apologize for I was mistaken
If I feel her skin on mine, I'm instantly at peace. I didn't know what that felt like
I go in the room so I can be creepy and smell her pillow and this nigga bought a tv <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Let me roll up so maybe I can be asleep by midnight
I don't want to get her flowers but I want to get her something that maybe her little green thumb self can nurture
If I had the money I'd get her a rice cooker for Mother's Day. I don't but it's on the list
Shit forgot to go to the store <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT> now I gotta get up early and do it tomorrow
Got my kiss tho <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><DANCER>
Yesss I love a nice turkey sammich <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Almost as soon as she gets home tomorrow, I have to leave. Exactly why I said I won't really see her for two days
Nothing but ironic that we're off the same days next week <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I hope she's home when I get there but I hope she's not bc then she won't be late to work
Why is my gf so into this lie she telling me lol
@QueenHoney_P I'm definitely at work...
Please let my shift go by quickly
Love the feeling of juices on my face way too much thanks.
I just know I could never date a touch me not.
And when my tongue hits it, I'm staying in it <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Craving <CAT FACE> in the worst way
1. sleep
2. you
3. sleep with you
Let me try to schedule some
I just want to smoke a blunt and get some head and a phenomenal stroke session
It sure af ain't causing no Sahara's over this way <SLEEPING FACE>
 
There are little Kirby like images on the living room ceiling
and there lies in my question
Just gives me so much determination to work through my shit. Keep asking myself the same question...
Is it Sunday?! What's with all this preaching on the TL <WEARY FACE>
Everybody tells me I'm nonchalant or I have no feelings but deep inside I be hurt or angry af
Nobody understands that #LRT
@PresidentJalen congrats!
Wake and bake since I'm up I guess
Of course I'm up <UNAMUSED FACE>
I love We Were Raised Under Grey Skies. Makes me think of her
Finally took that pill now that I'm kinda sober. Let the sleep and pain relief come <RELIEVED FACE>

No matter what the relationship is
Him so cuddly. Not as cuddly as his mom but I'm glad I have him
Kissing my Moo baby instead <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I can't deal with much more of this not sleeping shit. Idk what my body is running off at this point
Hope I go back to sleep.
Woke up outta nowhere wanting to kiss Mook <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
ALL OF THEM <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
That's weird to me bc I'm ALWAYS hungry if I don't eat anything.
I think I ate lava cakes this morning. But I didn't eat yesterday and I THINK day before yesterday is when I ate pasta but I'm not hungry...
@beautifulSouLO <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
That's what I hate about this fucking condition. I'm strong AF but it makes me feel like I'm not
I've got me. I probably shouldn't have done all the walking I did today but I've been learning so much about what I'll do to be happy
in the past three days ALL of my sisters, my aunt, and most shocking MY MOTHER have called me <CONFUSED FACE> they been talking about me
@beautifulSouLO yea don't LIVE in the past but don't act like you don't remember the shit and it can't possibly affect you now
ppl who say "I've let go of the past" are lying. The reason you don't date the same type your trash ass ex is, is BC the past still relevant
@beautifulSouLO yup. How can you keep yourself from repeating past mistakes without reflecting on the past mistakes themselves
@beautifulSouLO lol just returned 5 of his books to the library. He's amazing but nah dawg don't do this to me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Weed does NOT take my pain away. It lifts my spirits so that I can actually just not care I hurt and do stuff
Y'all I hit this blunt and almost called my boss like "I mean if you haven't found a manager to cover me I can come in right now" <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE>
@beautifulSouLO Paulo Cohelo be having me feeling like I can actually only live in the present and be great but nah the past is RELEVANT
I've been singing and dancing(in my head) bc it makes me happy.
I'm gonna pop this pill and hope it works. Smoke this blunt cause I know it'll help and drink this jäger and red bull
@TheDrunkAuntie lol no you don't
Baby bad ass snapped me too! Fuck it today has been a GOOD day <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
I need to be careful of what I speak into the universe bc the universe LISTENS
I say I don't have friends but what I mean is I don't have friends geographically close.
@eTheHustla I appreciate you
And bc I went out today I JUST spotted a little lake with a bench overlooking it so I will be going there soon
@DerogatoryWORD THANK YOU BOO I just realized the type when someone favorited it <WEARY FACE>
I won't walk without you
And I will not go without.
I know you're watching me from my head to my toes
Father led the example of how to draw beauty from pain

Lets walk around the city and whoever sees the most weirdest shit by the time we get to a destination pays
@TheDrunkAuntie LMAO
Today has been a very positive day despite a few things
When the dudes that used to plug you in get word you hurting and ask you wya and come drop off a free 8th <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I normally don't like talking to ppl I don't know. But today it happened to be exactly what I needed
Today alone so many ppl have shared their positive energy with me. It would be downright wrong for me to hold on to the negative in return
A man saw me doing yoga at the park and waited till I was done to ask if I was a teacher bc he wanted to learn
"Tired is bitter" Lena always speaking the word
Thankful that no matter what pain ppl do or try to cause me, I can find peace within myself
Walked from the bus stop to the park with a branch as a crutch and walked outta the park without it.
Today I laid out on a blanket at the park and let my skin soak up the sun and sweat out all the negative feelings inside me
Charging my phone a bit then on to my next errand
@chenelle_rainey Not really tbh like I don't care. This is marriage number 3
People fuck up so much happiness trying to possess things that they can have freely and just enjoy it while they're blessed with it
Love something fiercely without the will to possess it. This is what freedom means.
I need to stop wishing for another rainbow and feel blessed that I was able to marvel at the one I saw yesterday
Is it bad my mom is getting married tomorrow and I don't care?
Spiritually I'm still in a pretty good place. There's just this negativity looming over my spirit and I need to dismiss it promptly
So I'm going to go meditate in the park reflect and ask the Universe to show me the way to feed the fire that has dimmed inside me
I have to focus on doing that even when ppl treat me unkindly though. Bc I genuinely think that's the key to happiness.
But when I meet genuinely nice ppl or someone does a good deed for me, it makes me want to treat everyone I come in contact with, with love.
How ppl treat you shouldn't set the tone for how you treat others.
Gonna start doing that. Show no emotion feel no pain.
Gotta go back and take a poop before I do anything else lol
Gonna be on and off the bus all day. Pray for my back it's already had enough and I've only done one thing so far <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Think it's bc I'm listening to music
And I didn't cry so I'm proud of me
Determination will have me do a lot of things even if I'm in agony
It took my ass from 7:15 till JUST NOW to walk across a fucking parking lot <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Thank you universe
Praying this shower doesn't hurt
WHY has my job scheduled me to work on the day I have court when I requested that day off WEEKS ago?! See this is the shit....
Turned the heat on slept under two blankets and woke up drenched in sweat. Successfully broke my fever <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Gonna close my eyes and hope there's still some of this xan in my system so I can go back to sleep
Need a spine replacement or something
Of course I wake up feeling like straight shit back screaming at me as soon as I turned over <PENSIVE FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
From an hour to 4
I was only sleep for an hour?! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
3 or 4 
I know baby sis will sleep otp with me
Don't see myself doing it again 
But how ima carry all these books to return them....might have to save that for another day
Taking my bookworm self to the library tomorrow. Fuck this pain I felt better being outside than I've felt in the past two days
If this half a xan can just put me to sleep maybe my body will be like "ok you've been through enough" and let me stay asleep
Thanks for asking  
Attraction is.  
Yes.  
Yes 
Let's not let my check be depressing af so I can pay bills and get me some meds
Well half a xan but it's better than these bs Tylenol PMs
But she brought me a xan
Kelly's always not knowing how to unlock the door
@thiswomanswords thank you I'm praying for peace so I can at least sleep
Normally the pain would have subsided some by now <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
thrown up 3 times today. Just the smell of food makes me sick
@beautifulSouLO yup that's when you just stop talking
Shit my battery fucked up <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Guess I could bring my laptop out and plug my phone up to it....
I was happy just staring up at the clouds watching them break apart and form new ones. Just marveling at the universe
I miss the clouds
It's prolly not that cold to everyone else in there but anemia plus fibro plus this fever already has me shaking I just cannot
I wish there were outlets outside this condo so I could charge my phone without going in that icebox ass house
@DerogatoryWORD @pattiwak03 I've been working on releasing this negative energy all day
@pattiwak03 @DerogatoryWORD as is mine. You weren't even directly talking about my situation but I still felt it deeply
This is why I enjoy twitter. A lot of times ppl like to try and make me feel crazy for feelings or reactions
@beautifulSouLO some ppl understand, some don't. Gotta watch out for the ones that don't though
I know the past is the past but neglect it happened just bc it's history and see how easy it becomes for history to repeat itself
PAIN IS THE MUSE OF FIRE ASS POEMS 
Not gonna go around thinking every man is going to rape me or every woman is going to beat me but those wounds tingle
It's been a year since the second time I've been raped, 5 years since my last abusive relationship but trust me those wounds....
Also.  
And if you can't, that's fine too bc you always have you. Lesson I'm so glad that I learned
Huge difference in the actions of ppl that know you and ppl that are learning about you
@beautifulSouLO see this part...so many ppl don't understand. Even wounds that are healed can be sliced open with the merest amount of force
And when the wind gets cold, I'll wrap my arms around you
I will always love you
And I finally tuned the drums of my ears just to hear your voice
The only reason God gave me hands was to hold you
You should know I hear the sound of your voice in music, so I speak with you everyday
No I won't walk without you no
We were raised under grey skies on repeat
It's kinda cold outside too but warmer than in that house
Am I actually gonna attend a pride this year? Maybe...
Why y'all tweeting bout my ex <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
GIRL  
It's cold af in this house. Can't be in here like this.
My last relationship. Took me almost that long to build myself back up  
Feeling very helpless no idea what to do to make my pain go away. This migraine insists on staying with me all day
My fever won't break or go down and the rest of my body has decided to join the pain party...great
I've still got a quarter left of bread and I'm merely extremely tired but I feels it #LRT
!!!!!!!!! 
Y'all let these tweets fly so i can RT and be like yaasssss
5 or 6 maybe more if  I'm high “@JUPITERMOVESME: 3 RT @YolieTheJew: How many slices of pizza can you eat? I'll be judging.”
@ebbycoleclinton I'm here for it!
@AndrogyneAdvent SAVAGELY and I'm here for it
@ebbycoleclinton girlllllll!
But at least I saw beauty manifest out of nowhere today 
Getting over anger has become easier for me. But being hurt emotionally is still something that I take a while to get over
Appreciate Kelly for all her help.
My face looks terrible though. My eyes are so swollen <PENSIVE FACE>
Actually enjoyed waking up and seeing clouds as soon as I open my eyes. The thundering headache and wave of pain that followed, not so much
The fact that I want to name my daughter Feather Skye and literally see a feather quill pen cloud with a RAINBOW for it's tip is a sign
@DerogatoryWORD I wish I didn't have an iPhone 4 you can barely see the rainbow but I'm trying to observe it more than tweet about it
Theres a reason that out of all the times I've tried to walk, this time hurt the least. She wanted me to see this
Rainbow is literally the stem of the Feather 
Saw a Feather right above a rainbow. My daughter is trying to speak with me
At least I can say I saw a rainbow today

Even if I went to the park I would have to walk 15mins to get to the actual park so no
Gonna find me some strength to get up and make this trip
Was hoping I'd catch my coworker before she left work. Guess I was too late <PENSIVE FACE>
 
Watch the three ppl I know in this city are at work
Need to find someone to cover my shift
Soon as my phone charges I'll start figuring out how to fix that
I know why I can't sleep.
So fucking over this whole week
Of course I just had to get up to puke <UNAMUSED FACE>
<CAMERA>: Diane Audrey Ngako 
@Lilmama_Mia_ or 12
Ima just sit here and look at the wall
@Lilmama_Mia_ it is though
I woke up to the taste of blood in my mouth from biting down on my tongue so hard bc of the pain. Don't tell me ima be alright
Didn't hesitate to call her out her name and ask her how tf she know ima be alright if she doesn't know what I'm going through
I cussed out the triage lady for telling me she doesn't know what I'm going through but ima be alright
I just want to take a breath without feeling like I wish it was my last
@Lilmama_Mia_ cause it's at least 12 other ppl in every Gemini head
Leo* 
At least here I can say what I want and even if nobody supports it, I can still say it.
Sorry if I'm bothering y'all with my depressing ass tweets. I don't really have ppl to talk to.
Even the ppl I know with this condition aren't in as much pain as I am. Idk why it's so much worse for me.
You can only fight so much.
@pinkBangkok it's how I feel.
I want to talk to someone who will let me talk about how much I want to die. Someone who will support how I feel.
@SereneOnSaturn thanks
Wishing for death.
Couldn't take a shower bc the water hitting my back sent it into a spasm. Couldn't take a bath so now I'm just laying here
I want to end it all go to sleep and never wake up.
My mind is just blown at the two statements spoken to me today
My moms pissed my sisters are pissed now I'm pissed too
So now I'm just angry and in agony
These fuckboy meds they gave me had me cussing out every single person I talked to
Bc now I'm not just in pain and crying I'm that plus angry
There's a lot of things about this that pisses me off
The fact that the doctor told me my fever is being caused by the pain pisses me off
I want a house like that. With enough roof for me to go out the window and smoke
I miss going out on the ledge at KC house on the roof to smoke
Been mentally talking to myself telling myself I'm going to make it to my destination, that I'm going to be ok
And why does everyone think I'm a boy <UNAMUSED FACE>
How is one of these scripts 50mg LESS than the bs that already doesn't work
Don't even have money to fill these bs scripts. I'm just going to go to the house I lay my head at and cry myself to sleep
Literally just had ppl offer to call me a cab bc I can't walk. Got wheeled to the bus stop in a wheelchair
Can't keep myself from crying this time around on the bus
If they can't give me adequate pain meds I'm bout to ask them to at least write me a note so I can take tomorrow off and sleep
This lady really just sat next to me like "you wanna lay your head on my shoulder?" Ummm no....tf
One of them keeps asking me if I'm ok. She's all "I don't work in the ER but ima make sure you get there ok boo" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
These nurses that are about to get on the bus with me are just cackling
Feels like it took forever to get to this damn station
Every time this bus moves I have to fight to not cry in front of all these ppl
Listening to one of BM playlists on soundcloud
Can't find the song I want to put on repeat
It's just clear to me that some ppl are just not meant to be in my life. I have to accept that and be ok with it
I'm making decisions and I'm not going back on them
Of course I left the list I need in the house <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@poonNOpeen k
Ima just keep to myself from now on...
@poonNOpeen sorry for calling...
@poonNOpeen it's cool
Taking this list of past meds so I can let them know I'm not with the fuck shit
The fact that I'm in so much pain when I'm sleeping that I'm biting down on my tongue &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
@poonNOpeen bc you didn't answer
Queen didn't answer and I can't stop crying. I just need someone to keep my mind off the pain while I'm on these buses
@pattiwak03 I hope so too. I'm dreading riding two buses to get there with as much pain as I'm in
@pattiwak03 I'm in more pain than I've ever been in. I can barely move without wanting to burst into tears
It feels like my muscles are collapsed every step I take just makes my skin burn
@pattiwak03 that's why I'm going to the hospital
Nothing I do works and I'm so tired from only sleeping a few hours at a time
Can't do this anymore though
Idk how I'm going to get through riding two buses
I appreciate those I call to talk and those I call to listen.
Good talk with my baby momma. Actually calmed me to the point I might be able to sleep
I talk(tweet) about a lot of things. I really don't be caring though everybody expresses themselves differently
@poonNOpeen don't bring me into this
Listening to JP Cooper till my phone dies

PLEASE SHARE! 
I realized the place I live isn't MY home. And that just isn't ok with me.
I wish I could go to Charlotte this weekend not even to go to my moms wedding but I wanna see my sisters
I've barely cried all day but that made me literally sob. My baby sis who's always come to me for protection, consoling me
"I know you well enough to know you're seriously hurting. Don't worry we'll fix this"
"You have to be vigilant. You have to stick to what you won't tolerate or ppl will forever treat you like you don't matter"
My BM and my baby sis are the two ppl in my life who will let me talk then spit the most logical real shit
Talking to certain ppl I always walk away with such clarity. Some ppl are only good for listening. I appreciate those who can talk back
I've been handling my pain well today I think. So many times I wanted to cry but didn't
At the end of the day I'm the only person who's required to care about me and how I feel
Sis just let me vent and cry. My head and back hurt worse but I needed to get that out to find peace
@LezBriHonest bc if you manage to stay awake they make you feel high af
Even a broken clock is right twice a day
I remember when 10:13 was my favorite time of the day
Shit I forgot my mattress thing upstairs <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I can't do that walk again
I keep waking up with migraines
I just want someone to talk to
#OpSafeWinter

I just want to call her and cry and have her talk me down and tell me everything will be ok
My baby sister is my all time best friend. And she's only 16
The one person I know I can call needs to be asleep bc she has school in the morning
This bath isn't doing shit but making me hot
@x_diamondjewell lol
Getting up these stairs is going to take everything in me
I can't even cry bc it hurts so bad just to breathe
Literally feels like my back is broken. I have to pee so bad and I can't get up

Ki ass nasty lmfao
@poonNOpeen why is this so funny?! Lmao I didn't word it that way on purpose
Ki down for anything. I always liked that about her
@Anniethefoxx bc it's true! Lol
A fat dyke will put that pressure on ya but if her arms not strong enough to support the stroke that dick gon sit in the same place
Some do though. 
@elaxation it was funny lol
LMAO  
@poonNOpeen leave. never come back.
@liberated_lez never

Save yourself.
@poonNOpeen what happened now?!
I've had sex in the same room as my friends when I was a younger dyke.  
I actually love being home  
Exactly why I gotta talk to the bitch first  
I treat my gfs fighting like my sisters fighting I don't ask no questions I just jump in it
Jumping in  
Cause I've never had a threesome but I want to
I gotta talk to the female first  
@poonNOpeen I wasn't aware you were

@CEO_ofFagNation that is so disgusting
@poonNOpeen love you too Queen
@CEO_ofFagNation LMAOOOOOO

@poonNOpeen is they paying bills though?
Ki order me pasta <EYES> I'll pay you back in trident layers
I actually wish my roommate annoying ass was here to get me stuff so I don't have to move <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@poonNOpeen better not be
@poonNOpeen I'm not flirting with you <EYES>
Always be aware of what you say and how you say things.
Xans will put me tf under. At this point that's what I need
I'm really good at distancing myself from hostile situations. I hate them.
@poonNOpeen nope just bring me xans
Actually missing my regular flares when I could at least still move around
@liberated_lez awwwww
<WEARY FACE> all I did was move my arm <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Her tryna soothe me through texts just isn't working <PENSIVE FACE>
@poonNOpeen maybe he's not a good sport
@poonNOpeen you neglected him smh
@DoRaeMiFaSo same. It's hard to find genuine ppl.
@poonNOpeen you look younger than 19 and ion know what you be doing with Harold...
@DoRaeMiFaSo that's why I don't have friends
I just want to sleep through this pain and wake up with it gone <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@poonNOpeen lol nah

@poonNOpeen @e_moneylatenite el oh el
You must first rid yourself of negativity before positivity can do it's work
Only Ki calls me princess. I like girly cute shit like that so it's cool
Trying to just be patient bc I know the hospital isn't going to do shit for me but fuck
My friend taking so long with these pills and it's so clear that sleep just isn't for me today. Might have to just go to the ER
As soon as it gets to a point in a relationship we start putting our hands on each other, I'm done.
YUP  
Ima start disrespecting when ppl ask me to do shit and act like I'm never wrong since that's the wave
I ask to be left alone and my phone gets smacked out of my hand.
Verdant green on fleek bish  
Extremely over this nigga on everything I love.
Sad that I have to mentally prepare for simple shit
I need to summon all my super saiyan strength to pull myself up and walk up these stairs <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

I'm in so much pain I can't even cry. I just lay here trying to focus on not moving.

That police bicycle is ON TOP of Freddie Gray. 

Do you see what I see? 


I really need to make enough money to afford a doctor. I know I'm not supposed to work but can't get approved for disability
I'm about to be looked at like a real bitch bc I'm about to go to work do my job but outside of that I have no words for anyone
People are just so inconsiderate but expect me to always take them and what they want/need into consideration
I wake up on MY day off to two emails and 5 texts to cover a shift like I'm not already doing that all this week
I've been in pain all week working back to back open/close shifts, coming in early, staying late but I sleep and it's the end for some
I'm seeing lately that ppl will know I have a medical condition and still expect me to do EVERYTHING
I got tired of being my biggest enemy
I realized the importance of loving m…
Then I wake up to my boss asking me to cover someone's shift. Like do you not realize it's my day off?!
My back finally gave out smh
Extremely pissed i just went back to sleep and I'm up again. Now I can't get up <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
I want me and sleep to be friends but of course we're more like frienemies
Pete sassafras
My body is back to it's normal bs <PENSIVE FACE> don't know how much of this I can take
Since it's only acceptable for me to sleep on MY days off I'm gonna sleep this pain away
Of course I JUST went to sleep and now I'm up <UNAMUSED FACE>
I'm a witch
@ThuugLovee I mean...<EYES>
apparently the mark of witches with a gift are small attached earlobes <FLUSHED FACE>
I've never read a book that enlightened my spirit like The Alchemist. Brida is kinda a close second though.
@ThuugLovee what boobs?
The Alchemist will always be my favorite. Unless by the river Pedra I sat down and wept is better
@poonNOpeen oh yea I'm gonna read it again too. And Brida. I just finished it but it's so good I have to read it again
Ki and I are going through all the Cohelo books together. Every time I read a new one I have her read it.
@poonNOpeen next read Brida.
@poonNOpeen which one?
Solved all the puzzles on my game now I'm bored with it
Ion like her though
There's literally a specific place my legs and arms go and a certain way I sleep. And for some reason Imani is the only one to ever notice
There's only ever been one person that knows exactly what position I put myself in to fall asleep
Now that I'm not starving I can sleep
@PoeItUp_ stop it
Now I wish I was the only one here. The silence was great
@PoeItUp_ k that works
@PoeItUp_ so...like blue tigers
@PoeItUp_ I love you
@PoeItUp_ lol I feel rude though. I'm normally empathetic but I'm in a mood so maybe that's why

Spiritually I'm in a good place. Physically I'm trying to hold on but that's constant. Mentally I'm all over the place.
That last book was exactly what I needed to read.
When we spend too much time trying to understand instead of accepting, it keeps us from walking along our path
Learning some sacrifices are the easiest on your soul so long as the intentions are motivated by love
In reading these books I have learned so much about my inner self. It's allowed me to open my life up
The Magus knew he would never be with her even though she was his soul mate. He let her go anyway even though she wanted to stay
Loving something so fiercely that you do not possess. Keep the flowers in their soil. Love them enough to not want to possess them.
People give flowers as gifts bc they represent love. They are forced to watch the flower wither but if left in place it will thrive
I know I'm going to read Brida again soon.

Brida was really good. Made me look at soul mates differently....

Why don't ppl understand this. EYE AM WATCHING YOU  
Facts  
@poonNOpeen @NO_LIEES I'm too upset and halfway drunk to remember now
Slowly they have tricked us into thinking we have equal rights. While on social media, the lives of blacks are said to be equal to cattle
@deray next time they speak to you about the president you remind the news that our ancestors too had to riot for him to be in office today
We will fight.
I'm hurt but I'm more angry and afraid. Why must we fight to live? Idk but we must. And so we will protest and if need be, we WILL riot.
I don't want anyone's children to be murdered by police. No more. Why are so many parents outliving their children?

@Smack_datHOE it didn't take for THAT MAN to die. We as a people have been protesting almost non stop since Trayvon Martin
@Smack_datHOE our ancestors fought hard for us to have equality but we STILL don't have it so continue to fight and riot and loot we shall
@Smack_datHOE when you learned about looting and riots of the civil rights movement you didn't think it was pointless you were prolly proud
@Smack_datHOE our civil liberties and basic rights are being ignored, abused, and denied. THAT is why ppl are looting and rioting.
@Smack_datHOE you're missing the point. Nothing anyone is doing is POINTLESS. Yes an officer killed Freddie Grey. They WILL keep killing us

Baltimore has not lost it’s mind…

Baltimore is mourning. 

Baltimore is grieving. 

B…
@Smack_datHOE water fountain our grandparents and aunts and uncles looted and rioted and fought so we could. So pointless? Nah.
@Smack_datHOE it's all a factor. You don't want to personally fuck up a CVS fine but in the 50's when we couldn't even drink from the same
@Smack_datHOE you think the store has nothing to do with it? We live in a corrupt system where EVERY major corporation sees us as inferior
@sarahdinahetta @GOPBlackChick @twitter and if it wasn't a child's photo? You have nothing else to speak on so why speak at all?
Bc if it was my nephews out there I would stand with them. And even though it's not I will stand with the youth that COULD be them in 5yrs
NOBODY has to agree with what I say but speak against fellow blacks call them thugs say they have no reason to riot and I WILL SPEAK
@Smack_datHOE they aren't looting for show or bc they just "want to fuck something up" this is a fight for black lives. We just want to live
@Smack_datHOE I'm not saying looting is going to get them to stop killing us but looting is a form of expression against oppression.
@Smack_datHOE that you're going to fight for your life. They might not respect our fight but we all must fight.
I'll set it tf off for the kids I love. I stand with Baltimore I stand with ferguson I feel the pain you feel and I support y'all
@Smack_datHOE If anything this govt is proving property is worth more than our lives, than your child's life.
If it was one of the kids I know and love in Annapolis I'd burn all of Annapolis down
Kids are dying and it pisses me off that ppl I know with kids BLACK kids think ppl in bmore doing this for show
@Smack_datHOE if they killed tink or Ro or the twins or Muk you'd be out there burning shit down too and it wouldn't be funny
Burn some shit
Throw a rock , hell
Can't be any less effective than trying to explain to the opps why murder i…


Blacks only love Popeyes and malt liquor. 

Asshole.
@AndrogyneAdvent swear I'm going nuts like NO equal amount for all colors!
@AndrogyneAdvent right WHY they not even?!
@Sebulus @GOPBlackChick @twitter I'd ask if you want an Oreo one but you look like you'd say #alloroesmatter and request the yellow ones
@NO_LIEES I know. Is it weird I already wanna start looking? Lol
@_FoodForUrSoul no problem. If I wasn't a broke hoe I'd donate but since I can't I can at least spread the word
@NO_LIEES lol well I need baby pics and allat bc our baby can't be born or grow up looking like one of them ugly Asians
If we do not protest if we do not riot soon we will be arming ourselves. We will be policing the police and that will start war
Riot more. No more peaceful protests. Do you see what is happening? We protest and they deny us the right to. RIOT BC WE HAVE TO BE HEARD
@NO_LIEES but YOU SAID you want the baby to look like US fix your face
Our own people trying to criticize the way ppl in Baltimore are…
@NO_LIEES duh it's us baby. We gotta find a cute Asian boy so our baby can look like us <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Grown ass men, cops are throwing rocks at black kids, arresting black kids, KILLING black kids. Not sorry I care about that.
I'm IGNORANT cause I don't care they punched a white boy in the face? sorry he got punched sure but do EYE care personally fuck no
@ThuugLovee @NO_LIEES dash paid $800 for artificial insemination WASSUP?!
@ThuugLovee how much did you pay for it?
@ThuugLovee omg congrats dash OMGGGGG

I care more about those black kids out there being shot at, maced, tackled than that white boy. And I'm unapologetic about it.
Oh don't get it fucked up I KNOW it's not right I give no fucks they stole off on that white boy. But I don't....
@ThuugLovee nope I'm not single anymore lol. Crazy right?

@Nopoints4second you're a troll. We may be angry but your bs tweets aren't about to hurt shit turn your location on since you bold though
I want to be updated but I can't watch this anymore. The news unreliable af
@Nopoints4second you mean my 6 month old niece? lol try again mayonnaise boy
@_KimboNoSlice same mentality those cops and white ppl have fam. That's why they think they're justified.
@GOPBlackChick why you scared? What's twitter going to do for you? Same thing you do for your fellow black men and women NOT A DAMN THING
@GOPBlackChick @twitter lol fuck you and fuck twitter bitch
Hopefully the National Guard protects all the black children they are shooting and killing every day  
This has never been a game but now more than ever we need to stand. Those kids are our siblings age. We must stand with them #NCCU
#NCCU I know it's the end of the semester but we need to stand and protest for our young brothers and sisters in Baltimore
Idk if you noticed, but those are school children in that photo NBC 

Whet??
I ran the streets of Bmore. Know so many ppl who live there including friends and family. I'm afraid. I'm angry. I want to join the fight
@MolestMyyPumps my whole family mother and fathers side lives there. I'm in NC fighting tears
I hope I see you on the street one day  

Black life (humanity) &gt; property (things). 

This is not rocket science.
The lives of those children outweighs the value of that car. Will you remember that? Or will you use it as an excuse 
@wbaltv11 blocked me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
They can no longer kill us and the rest of us be silent. We see you. We will fight.
Today is #FreddieGray funeral and the @BaltimorePolice are showing they are prepared to create more of him #JusticeForFreddie
My sister almost moved to Baltimore. With her 4 sons. I'm so glad she didn't. I would be on the first megabus as close to bmore as I could

I am thankful for my strength and that even when it wavers, I remember I will persevere.
I have so much to be thankful for. Every time I start to complain I'm going to remind myself to give thanks
Thankful for this woman I was blessed with who sees both the best and worst in me and loves me completely
Thankful for this life I have and the fact that I woke up this morning pain free.

Finding out about so much shit I did off them baby xans <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_ChelleyChelle_ be*
Like all week I've known I'm being lied to. But I'm the type of person to wait until just the right moment to let you know you're caught
@_ChelleyChelle_ must me twin
I often catch ppl in lies that they don't even know I caught them in
I always wonder if I just have a serious mistrust for ppl or if I just have this sixth sense when I'm being lied to
Woke up from a Xan/henny coma talking gibberish
I wanna at least stay up till she leaves for work then I'm sleeping all of today and tomorrow

Nudity isn't about sex nor is it solely for artistic purposes. Some ppl just like being naked
Posting your nudes on public platforms is the wave. Where else did you see naked women? Playboy and art galleries.
@Tavietavie maybe they're getting self satisfaction idk lol
It's ppl I fuck with on here but none of them are CLOSE friends
Nope  
Being naked bc you want to IS a purpose.
Why?  
She wants me to eat, I want to throw up from the pain then drink henny till I feel nothing
I'm officially sure that right before my period comes, a flare does. But this one is the worst I've EVER had
Why would you wanna snort coke off a surface that baby feces coulda been on

You can see it. You gotta FEEL it.
Cried harder than I ever cried last night and the pain isn't nearly over
I'm going home to put on shorts and a tank and ask @NO_LIEES to roll a couple blunts so I can sit outside and fight this flare
Didn't even realize I haven't eaten today smh
I'm about to be in so much pain in a few hours
And still can't breathe without my whole right side hurting
Pissed I got woken up out of my sleep 5 hours before I have to be up and now I can't go back to sleep
She doesn't even realize I only text her when I'm bored
This girl so cute but her convos are repetitive af. Just boring
Ima check on her then get some sleep. Already dreading being up at 5am
Found out Queen in the hospital <PENSIVE FACE> hope she's doing ok
Tired of watching the same shit on my computer over and over
@AndrogyneAdvent every time
My roommate just really came in my room asking if I was ok <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> girl...
Always turned out terrible. Ranged from 2-5 years

I can't even twatch bae properly cause half her tweets are in another language lol
Full af and this nigga comes up here with dessert <WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
No matter what way she makes potatoes they're good
The thug may be a thug but she's an angel
I wanna talk to Queen but I'm going to resist. Gotta purge myself in order to get over that
Today started good but this damn rain ruined everything
Bout to go home to a hot bath and my wonderful mate
4:20 on 4/20
I love her
She wants to ride the bus all the way to my job just so I don't have to ride home by myself.
I hate riding the bus to work
Glad she's off tonight at least.
Getting my last few minutes in with my love before I have to leave for work
On snapchat dying talking to my little sister. I miss her
@NO_LIEES yessss lol you know I love your potatoes
@NO_LIEES idc what else we eat as long as salmon is included lol
Craving salmon so that's what we're eating for dinner
But her rides late af so she's irritated
Came home and baby was here. What a nice surprise.
Ima finish that henny when I get home. Have a mini turn up session by my lonesome since NOBODY is home
I actually prefer tweeting from text. Leaves me no room to twatch
AND I don't have to ride the bus home. Won't he do it <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
now to take my ass home so I can shower eat and begin my relaxing day off a few hours early
Idk how these other shift leaders be in here till damn near 10 like nah bruh I'm tryna get outta here soon as the doors lock
Everybody did they work nobody fucked around and we got the store closed in exactly 15 minutes
Exactly like I said. Closing should only take 15 minutes.
But im hungry so almost anything tastes alright at this point
This basil citrus turkey jerky is kinda alright
Just waiting for us to lock these doors so this last bit of stuff can get banged out and I can go tf home
b6 got me feeling energetic though <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> got me through my shift at least
Constantly washing my hands at work has my nails looking gross
Hopefully the thug saved me some shrimp Alfredo <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Now I'm bored af can't wait to get off and get home so I can eat
Literally all my closing stuff is done except the things I can't do until the doors are locked
I keep getting the urge to eat something but I'm not hungry
Pretty bummed I have to ride the bus home. I hate closing and riding the bus
Come on 9 o'clock
It's midnight pot, and kettle don't wanna hear your shit
THISSSSSS 
Alkalize the body.
Steaming up the shower so I can drink this apple cider vinegar water and sweat some toxins out.
I can't play these type games man.
Sharp ass pain shooting through my spine. So much for mind over fucking matter
I will always love you
Universe be looking out frfr
@NO_LIEES no tears to wipe I'm not crying anymore.
Welp that was over quicker than I expected...
@NO_LIEES can't cry anymore. Just gotta suck it up
@NO_LIEES mind over matter babe. I'm going to be ok. I have no choice.
@NO_LIEES stop. It's ok you have to work and I know that.
I used to only change bc circumstances forced me to. But now my changes are coming from growth and it feels amazing
I'm changing. Every day. Every second.
Do tell! Always wanted to experience this  
@thevariorum ppl tell me I look taller than I actually am. But they also think I look like I was born in a bando whipping work so...
When you gots to scoot up the stairs bc your dumb ass came to lay on the living room couch &lt; <PENSIVE FACE>
This is crucial.  
Pain isn't the worst I've felt so I'm gonna mind over matter this shit somehow someway
@ShariaBolshevik thanks lovely.
I could never bring myself to ask her to call out.
I said I just wanted one day of no pain and the universe gave me two so I'll stop griping and crying
My body is basically telling me "gotcha" thinking I was going to get through all this rainy weather without feeling like shit
I won't cry in front of her anymore though.
Just feels like someone took a sledgehammer to my back
@pattiwak03 sucks that I'm so doubtful but I am
@pattiwak03 same. Now I'm laying here just trying not to cry
@pattiwak03 didn't help me either
@poonNOpeen of course it didn't
Please don't let Mook have left out this room to go take a shit <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Just took a shower but I guess I'll take a bath. Anything to make this pain go away
@pattiwak03 think I might need this right now
Let me just pop these magnesium supplements and just lay here in pain. Did my yoga so at least I tried...<PENSIVE FACE>
Gotta look up yoga poses for spinal pain
@poonNOpeen <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm doing yoga shit
Bet since I don't have to be to work until 2 tomorrow I'll be asleep by midnight
@AndrogyneAdvent mine is pretty accurate 
@poonNOpeen yes.

Swear I had to zoom to see if that nigga was drooling in the first pic <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Why would you do that to your baby?
I'm tripping or this child abuse?  
Africans let her live for this?!  
K I need to be sleep <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@poonNOpeen oh and I meant to tell you to read Veronika decides to die by him too
Read "eleven minutes" by Paulo Cohelo @poonNOpeen @elaxation
It's weird bc I'm learning that love looks so different depending on the person you're with
I have immense love for someone but I haven't been in love in a long time.
Honestly forgot what this feels like  
Shoulda been sleep at 9 so leftover henny and a joint to put me to sleep it is
Never will I ever do that shit again  
That's the true definition of freedom. Loving something without ever owning it.
"We never really lose anyone, bc we don't own anyone"
If ever I find myself worried about the wrong shit, a little voice in my head reminds me not to stress what you can't control
Really wanna cut more inches off my locs but ppl still can't tell I cut them in the first place
I just need to find peace with this situation
Gotta be up at 5 so ima roll me a joint and smoke in this good nude and take my ass right to sleep hopefully
Need to make my bed only for sleeping. No more watching tv or reading in bed.
Who tf ever says "my dream girl a Taurus" the answer is nobody...
Nothing sacred with that chick I swear
Ewww never.  
I can sing fatal and pimp in me but only the first 3-5 days after a breakup
@FloatMia I can only sing fatal when my heart broke
bwoy fems will stress you tf out then threaten to cut you bc you look at them like you contemplating whether 25 to life would be worth it
