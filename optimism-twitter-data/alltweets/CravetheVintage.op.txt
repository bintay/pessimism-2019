Screenwriting has its perks, I believe. Lol that's my take.
Also, reading helps writing. This dynamic duo <THUMBS UP SIGN>üèæ
Being a writer isn't supposed to be easy. It's actually stepping out of your comfort zone &amp; going against the grain. Write to free yourself.
Have a mind set to where little things shouldn't bother you. Just smile &amp; remember, things happen.
Personal Goal : never get mad enough to say you had a bad day. Just flow &amp; be content. Things will come in order soon.
My Mom doesn't like anything. Called me, woke me up to start a rant. My baby is upset lol <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I do not mind mending old relationships, although sometimes, those relationships don't need to be mended.

I've actually taken back an ex after they cheated. Trust was just to iffy.
@J_Reddick2 my point. lol but then there's if they do it once, they'll do it again.
I know some ppl would &amp; then their relationship is better. Then, of course, there are others.....
So would you take back a person who cheats? If so, why?
