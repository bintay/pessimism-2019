i have absolutely no motivation to do anything anymore
their screaming in my head
I wanna play so bad
the desire to do it is killing me
i hate life. I'm done
no one cares until it's to late
there's no such thing as being happy. it's a made up concept
i probably shouldn't be left alone with what goes through my head
the water keeps getting deeper. my lungs keep burning. everyone keeps screaming. but I can't keep holding on
@maadeleine13 was also reminded how crazy @hey_ally_here is <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
and I'm not sleeping anymore tonight
I don't caree <RAISED HAND>
I laugh but it actually hurts
truth coming out now
my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
take a walk in other person's shoes before you judge the brand. you don't know what their story is so don't act like you do
I hate myself
running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
please make it stop
it's hard to be happy when voices scream at you
I drive myself insane
make it stop, please make it stop
save me from myself
I don't think I'm strong enough
I just want to be happy again
I feel like I'm drowning while everyone watches and tells me to swim
love how I have anxiety over bad weather and the band director is just like nahh we going to play today..
I need to learn how to get out of my head

I don't even know why
stop telling me shit I don't care. this is why I don't tell you anything
you don't know anything about me
so that makes my life perfect right?!?
I don't know if I did that right
every time I have a good day something ruins it.

wow
I need you more than anything
I don't know what it is about you but you make me happy
I really need to talk to you but I can't

music is the only escape from myself
I need a way to get out of my own head
I have to much shit going on in my head

why do I miss you this much?! I don't even know what to do besides sit here and think of you
I'm really about to break down and cry thinking of you this much.. a promise is a promise.. keep your word and come back please
I you wanna tell someone something tell them now because tomorrow might be to late..
if someone gave me one wish it would be for you to come back and see who I really feel about you because you'll never even know..
never going to be able to sleep now.. all I can think of is you and the memories of me and you.. you promised why can't you come back now
the funny thing is no one knows who I'm talking about.. but if you saw this you would know it's about you.. I miss you more than anything..
and you probably don't think of me ever... but that doesn't change the way I think of you and how much I think of you... I love you promise.
all the good times we had... and the inside jokes... and the songs we listened to over and over... I miss you so much...
I think about you a lot... and remember you're not coming back... but I will never forget... I promise even if you do... I'll remember you..
I'm obsessed with @HoodieAllen music <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> could listen to all his songs all day and night <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

first team bi*ch
don't step up in my way again 
cause I'll take it, I'll take it from 
don't step up in my way again 
cause you'll have it, you'll have it
I'm livin' through new experiences 
I'm tense only when I think about it
not a thing gonna get up in my way 
smile at everything I say
never tried to hide it 
didn't try to fight it
now it hit me and I just can't explain
