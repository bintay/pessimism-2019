As you soothe ur spirit with a little music,I entwine myself within the arranging sounds,&amp;the very thought is me free in ur subconscious
@maskedvandal someone will heal your heart. Mine has it's moments in the sun when the heartache is enveloped by healing hands. 
Thank u, yes
@maskedvandal I do. Love sucks.
@maskedvandal I hope you continue to write. I enjoy reading the beauty and power of your words.
I saw a red flag in the icy blue eternity of your eyes.
@maskedvandal I am sure any woman would love to be the one you write for. Games are for girls not women.
@maskedvandal Find a new muse. Your poetry is too special to spend on someone whose heart it does not captivate.
@maskedvandal and whoever your muse is, she is the luckiest woman in the world.
@maskedvandal You have a way with words
@maskedvandal breathtaking
@maskedvandal you're back! Are you alright? If you wanna chat, DM me.
Happy Mother's Day!
A HELOC, but for my heart.
You won't  regret falling in love with me.
@Alwayshorny7803 ha
@Alwayshorny7803 tired. Insomnia made me its bitch
@EvilInnocentEye @MischiefMemoirs @man_tampa @Cooper_Studios @Emy_Lizzy @jenthepoet1 @francmoose @MMAmicks Mercí





I wonder,

in the moments that lie between us,

is the love still real,

living its life

wandering aimlessly through eternity?
If ever there is a time

when you are finally free,

could you look inside your heart

with the hope of finding me?
Please find my soul in the sky
Beautifully written beyond the Kuiper Belt
In frozen darkness, alone I cry
Your radiance here can’t be felt
Shadows cease to exist

Time it stretches so far

The moonlight clenched in my fist

A firefly freed from a jar
@Alwayshorny7803 Someday when I am truly happy, my smile will be better
@Alwayshorny7803 bummer. Me too
@Alwayshorny7803 thanks and I hope nobody ever burned you. That shit sucks!
@Alwayshorny7803 I've been burned so I usually cannot see through the scars. Thanks for saying my smile is beautiful
@Alwayshorny7803 no, helping my daughter with homework
@Alwayshorny7803 that's the nicest thing anyone's said all day, maybe all week
@Alwayshorny7803 Guess the shower isn't the only steamy place
@Alwayshorny7803 whats next
@Alwayshorny7803 hands ha
@Alwayshorny7803 could always use help!
@Alwayshorny7803 sorry was showering
@Alwayshorny7803 that's sweet of you
@Alwayshorny7803 oh really?
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Albancon u want the job?
I need a muse.
Long day in bed 
@maskedvandal <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@maskedvandal good day, oh so lovely poet. <SUN WITH FACE>
I want our forever to last another day. #foreverandaday
I don't fit in and I prefer it that way.
I'm the promise nobody can keep.
Nothing boosts her self esteem more than hearing you say her face was made for fucking.
And to this ache of ten thousand years 
Again I've drowned at high tide 
You knew better than to leave me
As the water's edge lassoed me in
@EvilInnocentEye @SirsHappySub @SendU2Heaven @man_tampa @Emy_Lizzy @Cooper_Studios @francmoose Mercì
Our love lingers on in the depths of our galaxy
Frozen in time and space
It yearns for warm tears
And an echo to carry on
@maskedvandal Haha.
Enjoy! <GROWING HEART>
@maskedvandal Btw, you write so perfectly.  I am sorry you, too, are as sad in love as me.
Yes, indeed, but beauty is in the eye of ...
@maskedvandal I've been hung up on someone for too damn long. He just recently married some hairy moled trollop. 

Yes, stalkers suck!
@maskedvandal Yah. I have those dreams, too!
She'll never satisfy you like I did.
My stalker likes the "cold abyss." What a psychotic whore she is.
Heavy the burn of his glacier of a heart
So massive 
With room for all his concubines
I'll wait for a warm embrace
This heart was thrown into the cold abyss of the Kuiper Belt
And my cries are muffled in the airless freeze
All alone, so far from our bed
Loud are the pangs of want
Lost in the stridor of petulance
Cannot wait to watch Montage of Heck on @HBO tonight. #cobain
Do thoughts of kissing me rush in like a warm front in early spring days? Magic in bloom.
Does there really need to be a better love, a greater love? Why can't we just love? Just. Love.
There's too much wasted effort in hate.
for others have broken me
it's that I crumbled 
a million tiny pieces 
stardust &amp; aching memories…
The lies someone would tell
Like a potter spinning a wheel 
The kiln, the depths of hell
The truth never to reveal
Mild as the sand, but unweathered by abuse
Adrift in the whispers the heavens bestow
Oh this day I'm soft and diffuse
Like quiet memories from lifetimes ago
Soft moans pierce the silence
That had held its breath 
in the ice that formed between us
I'm the story arc of your blood
There are no arms waiting for me to curl up into this ponderous resignation
You've painted pictures in my dreams
With gentle brush strokes at parted seams
Like the clouds that rock the sun to sleep
Or the taste of your lips in my mind I keep
Wondrous, the early morning sky
As Venus gleams steadily above
And the hands of time wave goodbye
When I surrender myself to love
@poetme13 Your words help me find my own.
@poetme13 It's raw words as these that make me want to find that place, that moment they were born. How did you create such loveliness?
As I kiss you into my dreams
Hopeless, I know it seems
But forever is too long to wait
For your love's metamorphosis from hate
These words are all I can share until they run off the page and I run into your arms.
Write me a page in your life.
Letting you go into the echo of forever
That same forever frozen in your eyes
Irises like the sea
Windswept hello and goodbye
@Alwayshorny7803 <SUN WITH FACE>
@poetme13 Thank you for the fav. I'm trying to write for my daughter.
Every minute with you fades into the tidal wave of time
And you've grown up before I could finish with our first hug
@poetme13 wonderful. I never do any prompts and just tweet my own brand of heart and soul. I may try a prompt someday soon, though.
@poetme13 lol ok! Whew! I thought you were going to say it's a tough crowd around here.
@poetme13 How so?
@poetme13 Well keep up the great work. I hope to be able to bounce ideas off you soon! Thank you for the follow, my new friend.
@poetme13 Do you have a writing degree or teach? You seem to understand that poetry is painting pictures with words.
@poetme13 Hi. I noticed you write very well, especially in 140 characters or less! Lol. I have a degree in writing. I compliment very few.
@LuceyJoseph hi <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
on his rickety lawn chair
listening the Red Sox baseball
on the radio 
smokey memories 
swirling from his pipe 
I s…
Travel to me
Like the light of a million stars
Time is swept up 
In a constellation of hope
Never to be outmeasured 
By my love for you
Friday night lights 
Put red streaks in my hair. Kinda subtle. 
It feels like Monday but it's Friday. Enjoy the weekend tweople! 
Feeling blue
Hello from Sunny Florida 
@Alwayshorny7803 it's been a battle
@Alwayshorny7803 thanks
@Alwayshorny7803 stuff about the neck and scan for my lower back plus my car is finally getting fixed
@Alwayshorny7803 ok just busy and I have a busy week ahead
Off a forgotten shelf
And mindless of the future,
Out the shop's door
And into oblivion,
An old memory no more.
Like a porcelain doll's
Yellowed dress and faint musk  
Time's enveloped passive touch
Roars at the indignity of want
Raw, fleeting,
Gone
Echoes of memories,
Ramblings of the sea,
the grains of sand&amp;shards of shells
Bore the test of time
Just like me
Frayed but not forgotten
I revisit those memories,
A touch of the past,
A shop filled with broken antiques,
Where I still cannot pick up the pieces.
@Alwayshorny7803 been worse. Things are ok. Glad it's the weekend.
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Alwayshorny7803 hi <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Lazy late afternoon 
Good afternoon 
@Albancon good morning xoxo
I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
@Albancon <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Sleepless, 
I'm still dreaming you into my life.
May my love awaken in your heart.
I push                                               You pull                                             I push again as we love from afar
You cultivated my childlike salient love.                                            How could I not run into your arms?
@Alwayshorny7803 hi. Bad. Neck. Ugh
Everything hurts for a reason.
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Jedizaugg aww thank u <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Alwayshorny7803 my neck is fucked! Oh well, guess I gotta decide surgery or PT
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm comfy, I guess 
@Alwayshorny7803 Fortunately, it's just my neck they're examining!
@Alwayshorny7803 I hope the ct goes well. It's with dye contrast.
@Alwayshorny7803 Trying to de-stress. I'm nervous about going for the ct scan on tuesday

@Alwayshorny7803 sorry
@Alwayshorny7803 sorry was having breathing issues
@Alwayshorny7803 maybe you do
@Alwayshorny7803 Lol I look at you like that often <EYES>
I'll know it's love when, having seen the best and worst of me, he'll choose to stay.
Is it Friday yet?
@revbuzz57 lmao I agree, bugs bunny teeth
Where the fuck is her chin and his taste? Ugh
The parity of lovers' loves never outmeasures the disparity between the time that binds their hearts and the time to say goodbye.
So many stars to wish upon, but it was you I chose.
The shallow breaths of this humid night serenade me with the melody of a memory.
@loqiel me too
@loqiel it's not my strong point
@loqiel I'm patient  <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
If you get back to me three days later, I'm gonna ignore the fact that I ever knew you.
I hate assumptions.
At least I have eyebrows.
If you think you're a catch, stick the fishing pole up you ass because it's the only pole you've got that makes you worth my time.
I'm only an adult when I need to be or when you want me to be. Right now, I'm gonna be as childish as I can be. Pppppffffttttttbbbbbfffftttt
Can you imagine someone thinking the mediocre sex you had with him made you grow feelings? Hahaha. Maybe if the sex was better...nah!
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@LuceyJoseph shit
@LuceyJoseph No no forget the key
@LuceyJoseph and the ones I should delete because it was done on a dare
@LuceyJoseph the ones in my pics here
@LuceyJoseph fuck! Now you tell me!?!
@LuceyJoseph So does that mean you looked at my pics already? <EYES>
@Alwayshorny7803 the chiro no helpy at all
@LuceyJoseph Bring out the handcuffs
@LuceyJoseph well I thought you's whip out...meh I'll behave.
@LuceyJoseph don't get too exited there. Your neighbors might call the cops.
@Alwayshorny7803 my eye has been twitching on and off for 2 days! That's so not sexy! And my neck hurts and I'm in party mode but can't! Lol
@LuceyJoseph I'll settle for it
@LuceyJoseph well you should! I'm the prize you've win. Ok ok ok, the booby prize.
@LuceyJoseph Hmmmm my momma says to trust a guy who blushes. And ok...whip it out
@LuceyJoseph ok you win the adorable contest tonight
@LuceyJoseph can I join in? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@LuceyJoseph Politically correct
@LuceyJoseph speaking of pineapple express, The Rock is hosting (told ya I'm not PC)
@LuceyJoseph watching SNL
@LuceyJoseph Was in car accident two weeks ago. Not a bad one, but enough to fuck up my neck and lower back
@LuceyJoseph I agree. KY had a spotless year. Blah. Anyway, my night ended early. Back home with a six pack and some ice on my neck.
@Alwayshorny7803 I am so not sexy. Let me drink more to contemplate this.
@LuceyJoseph Any fucking time
@Alwayshorny7803 <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@LuceyJoseph a smile to brighten the dark sky? Lol 
@Alwayshorny7803 here 
@Alwayshorny7803 My track records is stellar &amp; compliments, keep 'em coming
@Alwayshorny7803 I attract all kinds of that! My momma calls me a jerk magnet
@LuceyJoseph whew!
@LuceyJoseph ok ok
@LuceyJoseph well the KY boys are in the lead now
@LuceyJoseph surprising about the score. Thought Kentucky was the holy grail this year.
Tomorrow's Palm Sunday and I'm in Florida, man!
@LuceyJoseph Thank you and enjoy the game, sir. I'm always just a tweet away.
@LuceyJoseph I love being told that I'm good, sir. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@LuceyJoseph I see. A slew of my FB friends are parked in front of their tvs. #GoIrish
@LuceyJoseph true, but first I wanna go buy something fun to wear. My 12 year old stole most of my clothes!
Did Florida forget to pay the electric bill? It's fucking chilly tonight! 
@LuceyJoseph yah I know.
@LuceyJoseph I'm not looking for that kinda company. Too much trouble. Not worth trying. I could use a friendly smile and non PC talk.
@LuceyJoseph me, too. Gets boring. A girl needs a little company sometimes
@LuceyJoseph exactly!
@LuceyJoseph yah much better than drinkin alone and sitting around braless.
@LuceyJoseph Bwaha so no millions for you.Shit, I wish I could've gotten raped by a priest so now I could buy my kids a cookie dough factory
@LuceyJoseph haha hope nothing was coming before or after mass started
@LuceyJoseph Alter boy! Wow. The priests must have loved you! Hehe
Betwixt and between beer at home or lots of beer at Dean's Tex Mex in Punta Gorda including live music!
Betwixt and between taking my bra off and settling in for the night, or putting on a push up one and go rockin' in the free world.
@LuceyJoseph I grew up catholic (yikes) but I have said that if they gave out cookie dough and JD instead of that Jesus cookie &amp; wine...
@LuceyJoseph With a side of cookie dough...that's the dough, not the ice cream.
@LuceyJoseph I have a 14 year old son named after Eddie Vedder, &amp; 12 &amp; 7 year old girls. I'm doing great according to them, so for now...
@LuceyJoseph Ha. Yah wait til they're 15. Which is next year, for one of mine. Ugh. We have pearl jam in common, too
@LuceyJoseph probably not. My kids think I'm great!
@LuceyJoseph then I did something right today! Yay!
@LuceyJoseph Hope I didn't rattle your nerves with my horrible excuse of a covert dis to that hag. Lol.
@LuceyJoseph Thanks for fav'ing that...I think
But I forgive her because she gave me a great excuse to get a divorce. Yay!
The previous tweet was to the slut who busted apart my marriage. She's been flaunting it for 3 years. Poor thing and her missing chin.
@morgansphoenix just stay the hell out of Florida.
@stevemman did you make the shadow boxes on the wall? Me likey.
"What the fuck was I drinking about? "
Me, waking up with a hangover.
@Albancon <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
All in all, I'd choose the pain of my heart breaking over a cold and unfeeling one, every fucking time.
@Alwayshorny7803 actually my son's are...I mostly watered the garden...my knees need to get dirty
Did I ever love you? Does the sun revolve around you? Oh wait, you are disillusioned, after all. Maybe delusional. Get that shit fixed.
If by hate you mean that I wish fire ants would crawl up your asshole and bite their way through your prostate, yes, that.
@Alwayshorny7803 I'd love to
@Alwayshorny7803 Do you want me to kidnap you?
The joys of motherhood: Sleepover tomorrow night. FML again!
The joys of motherhood: tomorrow night taking my daughter and her BFF to see Insurgent. FML.
@Alwayshorny7803 ah ok. It's a big geek fest.
@Alwayshorny7803 You go to that?
@Alwayshorny7803 busy day and tired. Pet sitting and gardening for my neighbors.
Drown my fear
Till you all.just disappear...
The day that you tossed me aside has come. The sun picks apart the morning fog. The distilled misty dew of my tears strewn across the miles.
I will never forget, instead I'll just turn the morning fog into a veil that hides my truth. You.
Distant. So I'll stay away. You'll regret the cold of this divide someday.
Never wanted my heart to get swept up in the spin of the heat between us.
This warm, humid night feels like when your arms were around me as we made love.
Won't apologize for knowing that you are like comfort food for my heart.
It's been too long, like the stretch of a house cat in your bed. Come the morning light, another night passes, crossing me off your mind.
All I fantasize about is tasting you over and over again because you taste like the place where now and forever exchange breaths.
I felt the rush of Poseidon channeling through us as we made love,it's just that I cant tell you this.My caged heart sneaks peeks at freedom
The bastardization of beautiful: a word that lost its value, and now feels antiquated and overused.
@Alwayshorny7803 yup. Go to chiro every day for 2 weeks. Then 3x a week for 2 months
@Alwayshorny7803 ok just lots of neck pain
I wish I could be who you love instead of who you wanna fuck.

@oaklandishdude mine needs adjusting. Maybe a reminder that lowering my standards leads to stepping in a pile of shit.
@oaklandishdude I just got burned my making an exception. Never again.
@oaklandishdude Time is precious. Wasting it on sub-par asshats makes no sense. I seek out people up to and above par. But I see your point.
Don't lower your standards for anybody. Have them rise to yours.
I'm not a temporary measure.

@GodlessLogic <TROPHY>
Sleep wants no part of me now.
<PENSIVE FACE>
Excuses, excuses.
Wanted: someone thoughtful enough to say he's not interested
Not used to being turned away.
@JustinWieting haha there are plenty
@JustinWieting thanks <GRINNING FACE>
@JustinWieting yes, they attracted too many jerks
@JustinWieting not many of us left
Dinner! 
Far away from mad desire...
@GodlessLogic @gdosland @Playdoughpoem Stfu isn't very respectful! Haven't you found god yet? Me, neither. Going to check under my bed now.
@JustinWieting yes. More than once
Hold me and stop me from shaking.
I've come undone from this love we've been making.
My lips meet yours and cease the yearning and aching.
A mere seed, your words, in my garden of love.
A wondrous night we've spent under the stars above.
Your heart, I wear it just like a glove.
@revbuzz57 oh how sexy!
Headed out for a long walk. It's beautiful here in SW Fl
I believe her pussy has fleas.
Just shut up and kiss me.
@oaklandishdude It's alright. Still in bed. Medication kicked my ass. Haha
Rex Ryan, my ex, and me in 2011 
I still miss PKD. Best professor ever!
What's the weather like in New Jersey?
I'm sorry, but Jimmy Dean sausages look like they probably came from donkey dick. #nasty
Ewww 
@OffHeGoes_85 indeed. It'll be next.
@SFSJoe one of mine
@oaklandishdude good morning, dude
@oaklandishdude yep, it's what's playin
No Code or Vitology? Decisions. Decisions.
@GodlessLogic nicely done
Blah
@Alwayshorny7803 meh, not my thing
@SFSJoe yep
@Alwayshorny7803 oh sure
Know what bullshit is? Allowing someone the privilege of getting to know you and then they take you for granted. Fuck that!
@Alwayshorny7803 ok?
@Alwayshorny7803 beats me (pun intended)
@Alwayshorny7803 I guess that goes with the territory
12 miles...only ran 1.22 of them. Trying to keep my knee stable.
@Alwayshorny7803 I was just funning
@Alwayshorny7803 ha
I wished... 
Soft-spoken poet wannabe, with a killer sense of humor and a spunky personality seeks intelligent people for good conversation &amp; laughs.
Ever just feel like you're in the way? That's my all the time, every day.
I'll help with airfare, just book a flight and come meet me
If you want me, you damn well better prove it!
So this love your neighbor bible shit, do I take it literally? He's a fucking smoke show!<FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
During the heat of the moment, is it ok to go ass to mouth?
You can lose the fat, but you can't lose the whore!
I'm worthless
Who's next? Who wants me to believe their bullshit?
I'm not sure if you want me but I know you want all the others.
Offer up your best defense, this is the end of the innocence
@revbuzz57 exactly!
@revbuzz57 Remember Tammy Faye's blue eyeshadow &amp; black mascara? Whoa did she need a chisel to take that shit off?
@revbuzz57 Jim Bakker and his whore, Jessica Hahn, too.
To the tweeps who farted as their lovers went down on them, have you no shame? Me neither.
Calgon, lock me in your rape van!
@bunksteve don't try this at home folks!
@bunksteve no just making anti-religion funnies
Holey,Holey,Holey Lord. No, I didn't misspell any of this tweet.
Jesus' birthday? How can us fellow Capricorns match up?
I believe in Christmas. Didn't Hallmark invent it?
Went from bad day to better night
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude i guess but its true
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude no biggie. I enjoyed our tit for tatt game <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude just 2?

@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude nah
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude ten years

@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude Great. Me, too
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic Excellent job. Nice touch on the tit
Ok my acceptance speech is done

@oaklandishdude 
@GodlessLogic i'm in love <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic so can the rhythm of a bottle of Jameson
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic i'm seeing red &amp; not on the rag
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic Be still my beating <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I need to work on my approach.
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic intimidating? Moi?
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude I'll just masturbate to your FF vids on youtube.
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic Yup, he did <TROPHY>
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude you
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude In @GodlessLogic I trust!
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic speech! Speech! Speech! <COCKTAIL GLASS>
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude cool!
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude that trophy would still be for you GL
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic ha
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic Yes, daddy?
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude excuse me while I tip the man in the canoe. Holy fucking hot body!
@GodlessLogic Boy oh boy, I'm really liking you!
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic Cantankerous geezer? Or just hoping for pics?
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude Can I scold you and put you over my knee just so he can beat off for the 5th time? I have stock in Kleenex. $
@GodlessLogic @oaklandishdude I am not sure his name is Tom. He seems more like a Zach to me.
@oaklandishdude @GodlessLogic then go to bed and beat off to the thought of me scolding this youngster...or just beat off. #fun
@GodlessLogic no. You told me your age. I still thought you were hot even though I thought u were 18
@GodlessLogic a bit young but hey, you've made me rethink my stance on cougaring
@GodlessLogic lol. I'd be cougaring you. Fuck, that pic of your tatt, your bod, hot flashes! Haha
@GodlessLogic i know! I already feel like a  pervy old lady!
@GodlessLogic yup. I figured a senior in high school haha
@GodlessLogic cool!
@GodlessLogic are u over 21?
@GodlessLogic I like fun. Just as long as it's legal!
@GodlessLogic Just one or two isn't much fun.
@GodlessLogic Oh man, you are truly my favorite tweep. If we lived closer, I'd buy you a few beers.
I'll go to church when they start handing out condoms and shots of Jameson instead of that stale Jesus cookie and herpes sore wine.
@GodlessLogic I think they have better tweeps to say nice things to.
@GodlessLogic @DeanModified I followed. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@GodlessLogic That's the best thing anyone's said about me on twitter, ever. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@GodlessLogic stuff it in. Stops the bleeding. God likes money anyway. Look at the bank the churches have.
@GodlessLogic no, not at all. It'd be cheap though. He'd get change back. That'd be a bitch. Fall right through the hole.
@GodlessLogic @SFSJoe totally!
@GodlessLogic kinda like a pocket pussy but on it's period
@GodlessLogic @SFSJoe <TROPHY>
@GodlessLogic jerking off could be interesting, too
@SFSJoe Thanks to @GodlessLogic, for making it. But thank u for saying so
@revbuzz57 Maybe not. I just find blasphemous. Gimme some of that Joel Olsteen money. I'll just put don't in front of all he utters.
@GodlessLogic holes in the palms
@GodlessLogic and forget popping pain meds. That'll just fall right through. Oh &amp; M&amp;m's are out of the question.
@GodlessLogic imagine the fun in a bubble bath!
The Bible miniseries and The Passion of the Christ made a shit ton of bank but isn't that exactly what The bible preaches against? Greed?
@GodlessLogic just through it
@GodlessLogic Got busted in Cath School for saying Good Friday, more like Palm Sunday. Get it? Ouch
I kan tipe gud I swair
@GodlessLogic I've been known to quip, "We must be gods because we've created the big bang." But never caed anyone Jesus, save the lawn guy.
@GodlessLogic <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@GodlessLogic My fav thing to say to a religious freak is "Thou shall not take the Lord's name in vain, except when your fucking." It works!
@GodlessLogic me, too <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@GodlessLogic Good. I can trust a man who blushes.
@GodlessLogic I really am. You're a smoke show! <FIRE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
This little girl luvs me 
@GodlessLogic no. THANK YOU! Ya made my heart beat all fast!
@GodlessLogic holy yummy!  And nice tatt
@Alwayshorny7803 unbridled inner-child!
@Alwayshorny7803 Thanks wild man!
@Alwayshorny7803 Slow &amp; steady
@GodlessLogic Let's see it!
@GodlessLogic emotional is good. Women like guys with a sensitive side.
@Alwayshorny7803 I'm on the track, the starting shot's been fired, but damn this run is long and lackluster.
@GodlessLogic I hope you folks know they raised a really great guy!
@Alwayshorny7803 of course
@Alwayshorny7803 It should be. It must be.
@GodlessLogic Hey. I wanted to thank you for caring enough about make me smile earlier. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Alwayshorny7803 Thanks. trying to find myself. I went through major heartbreak and I'm trying to get to that light at the end of the tunnel
@emef14 I'm thinking about quitting social media. Not sure that I've made a positive impact &amp; not sure it has made a positive impact on me.
@Alwayshorny7803 ditto to what I said to emef
@emef14 why? I'm def not the life of the party.
Will you never forget me? Will you miss me if I leave?
@Alwayshorny7803 i know
@Alwayshorny7803 or live too far
@Alwayshorny7803 I was cheated on &amp; I have been fearful.
@Alwayshorny7803 I think I'm just not cut out for love
@Alwayshorny7803 pretty much
@Alwayshorny7803 sometimes fun for me is doing absolutely nothing except looking at the night sky.
@Alwayshorny7803 my fun isn't always everyone else's.
@Alwayshorny7803 I'm ready but hoping he finds me soon.
Yes, please! 
@Alwayshorny7803 My gut feeling is that I'm barking up the wrong tree.
@Alwayshorny7803 no. The one I want and the one who has my heart lives 2950 miles away.
@Alwayshorny7803 ha, never
@emef14 Amazing. <THUMBS UP SIGN><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@emef14 Yay! Very good news! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@GodlessLogic you're a doll <KISS MARK>

@GodlessLogic i fish. It is relaxing.

@BobbyWohlfert <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><KISS MARK>
@GodlessLogic lol! Keep trying
@BobbyWohlfert ok, thank u
@GodlessLogic I do, but gosh that looks like my wake
@GodlessLogic hahaha santa doesn't exist!
@GodlessLogic see previous post about men
@GodlessLogic it's how my day is going

Bed, because my dreams are better than my reality.
ISO an emotionally mature guy. Dealing with men that act like they are 13 just isn't for moi.
@BobbyWohlfert it wasn't said. It's just a gut feeling. Btw, my kids need to learn some kind of self defense. Any recommendations?
@emef14 Will you hold a candle til it burns up your arm?
@GodlessLogic how cute! You, too! And thanks, I guess? <KISS MARK><KISS MARK><KISS MARK>
Guess I'm not worth it.
How much difference does it make?
Sometimes all I want is for someone to hold me, other times I want him to hold me down and kiss and fuck me hard! #truestory
@emef14 great song! And uh, it doesn't have to be.
@emef14 Turn that frown upside down!
@emef14 Indeed. As do the thoughts of doing shots off some adorable guy's body.
The spirits at the bar haunt me. Whiskey, gin, and wine.
@Alwayshorny7803 i wish

@Alwayshorny7803 good! You?
@Alwayshorny7803 me too
@Alwayshorny7803 Not in bed anymore. At party
@JustinWieting underneath my dress, yes
Say you don't want to share me because you want me to be all yours.
From the song Breathing ~Lifehouse

I'm finding my way back to sanity again
Though I don't really know ... 
@emef14 cool
Chain your heart to mine
@emef14 what was your time?
@revbuzz57 hahahaha totally!
Learning that tweeting while drunk or coming down off of anesthesia makes as much sense as Chinese algebra.
@ephkadel Was on the couch
After orgasm view, circa 1 something AM. Thanks Mr Not Intimidated Anymore. 
@bunksteve @JamesGunn Cult following, indeed
Using you to get off from far away. Using you to escape from nightmares. Using you because you make me smile. Using you as my muse. Love
@bunksteve Wasn't the guy from Castle in that?
@bunksteve yes! Love finters. Got that painting in New Orleans
Exciting night 
Staring at the wall 
Awake. Nightcap didn't work. Blah! I have a party to attend tomorrow. Gonna be draggin my ass.
@cubishboy Exactly! Gonna start singing Let it Go from Frozen, too!
@cubishboy feel the same about Zach Parise. Me no likey the wild!
@cubishboy I'm gonna have to pay attention to the blues now and root for the teams they face. I'm a bitter bitch, huh?
@cubishboy must be crazy at Christmas for him.
@cubishboy ha! True. Oh boy did he catch heat for a bit. He was shagging his then wife's sis-in-law, then married her. Fans gave him hell
@cubishboy Disappointments come in many forms from just about everyone. I'm still shocked at this Brodeur shit. 700k plus bonuses. Blah!
@cubishboy Hahahahaha surprising coming from a guy. Nicely played.
@cubishboy that's true. I figured he high-tailed it back to Quebec, but noooo. Why do I feel betrayed?
@cubishboy upsetting! He belongs in Red not blue!
Holy shit, I had zero clue Marty Brodeur is playing for the St Louis Blues. I thought he retired from hockey as a @NHLDevils goalie.
Goodnight moon 
It's been a long December and there's reason to believe maybe this year will be better than the last....
He's stealing from more than one cookie jar. I know it.
I'm a jerk magnet
You touch me from afar.
@JustinWieting I do!
@JustinWieting ha no, dust. Cleaned my house n the vacuum kicks up dust.
@JustinWieting no, allergies
Itchy throat! Ugh.
@JustinWieting lol no but if u wanna text n have an iphone or any i device let me know.
@jaynburbs thanks
Say something, I'm giving up on you.
You say you want to get to know me, but your actions say something different.
@jaynburbs no worries. I lowered my standards anyhow. My bad.
If I text you and you don't text me back, it shows me that I've wasted too much time on you.
@emef14 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@emef14 <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@JustinWieting you are right, darlin
@JustinWieting so far so good here
@JustinWieting idk. If someone would keep me warm, I'd luv it
@JustinWieting yes, why do u?
@JustinWieting blah! Last winter in New Jersey broke me!
@JustinWieting it is, this just happened, too 
@JustinWieting any time <WINKING FACE>
@emef14 is that some kind of Hawaiian sex position? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>

@JustinWieting hahahaha! Funny dude
@JustinWieting have more confidence in yourself.
@JustinWieting whatever it is, don't regret it. I have 1 I regret.
@JustinWieting well, maybe you're better
@JustinWieting And I'm getting another one next month.
@JustinWieting idk? Idk whatcha look like
@JustinWieting I have 5 tattoos. A matryoshka doll, the pearl jam stickman, my 3 kids names, an elephant, and my ex's name
@JustinWieting you'd look good
@JustinWieting aww no way
@JustinWieting good, good!
@JustinWieting oh really? Mmmm lemme see, sex pot!
@JustinWieting no, no! I thought it was funny that you said he does nothing for you.
@JustinWieting don't be! I laughed!
@JustinWieting would't think so

Your move life.
@jasonmaki11 Hey! I have missed you so much! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Sexy! 
Hawt! 
Smoke show!

So yummy! Omfg! <EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Blue eyes and dimples always win me over.
Just wanna be the only face in the crowd. *sigh*
@theunderbridge well played

@OffHeGoes_85 @hetspijtme haha how genius. I'm sorry!
@OffHeGoes_85 @hetspijtme I feel so sorry about this, for sure. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Sorry.
@OffHeGoes_85 @hetspijtme we're sorry! So sorry!
@hetspijtme
@OffHeGoes_85 @hetspijtme I'm super sorry! I'm the sorriest girl alive! I'm sorry! <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@OffHeGoes_85 @hetspijtme haha let's keep that bot busy! Sorry! Sorry! So fucking sorry
@hetspijtme @OffHeGoes_85 ok that's weird
@SFSJoe aww. I'm human. Nobody's perfect
Some days you're in the barrel. Some days you are the barrel.
@OffHeGoes_85 I'm here all day!
@OffHeGoes_85 Pee is piss
@OffHeGoes_85 ok, just as long as it's not pees in a pod, we're good
@OffHeGoes_85 me, too
My allergy to bullshit is so bad that I carry around a roll of toilet paper and give some out quite often on a daily basis.
@OffHeGoes_85 hahaha
Somedays I feel beautiful. Today is not one of those days. Having ovaries truly sucks sometimes.
I'm fun, but don't cross me
Players need not apply
Dear Adults, if you like T Swizzle then we cannot be friends.
I'm not going to be another face in the crowd.
So, If I say who the dribblecock is, will any of my followers flame him for me?
I think I was catfished
@SirSamDamaged hottttt
@emef14 figured
@emef14 are those ROTFL tears?
In search of someone who communicates like an adult instead of a 14 year old boy.
Mixed signals. Such bullshit.
@emef14 that face looks sad
@revbuzz57 all 3
@rudysplace hey Rudy!
@revbuzz57 and booze
@revbuzz57 bring your guy
@emef14 and I now rescind the pool boy offer
@emef14 no and no and gawd no
@emef14 I'll quit drooling. We can't have your bevy of ladies thinking you're flirting with me.
@revbuzz57 pool boy will@also make drinks &amp; rub sunblock me
@emef14 be flattered. I'm way picky.
@revbuzz57 was that a bitch slap?
@emef14 only for you. **sigh**
@mikebuzek noooo
@mikebuzek nice job!
@mikebuzek yup. Minus the pasta, if you're dieting and it is healthy
@mikebuzek in place of the shrimp
@mikebuzek goes well with veggies too
@emef14 making love after midnight <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@mikebuzek huh?
@mikebuzek use angel hair pasta, add it to the frying pan once shrimp is cooked, with the evoo and lemon, garlic, salt&amp;pepper
@mikebuzek it's awesomely yummy!
@mikebuzek True. I even add shaved rind to certain dishes, like pasta and shrimp with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and lemon. Yum!
@SFSJoe meh. Today's view is skewed.
@mikebuzek Yah, me too. Homemade lemonade, long island iced tea, reg lemonade...lemon chicken...I can go on...
@emef14 Said just like a valley gurl hahaha
@mikebuzek I'm getting a lemon tree for Christmas, so come on down
@emef14 I am
@mikebuzek it's in the lanai, fancy term for pool cage
@mikebuzek I'm not good with keeping it that way. Also baby frogs take laps in it. It kinda freaks me out. #FloridaProblems
@emef14 That's cool as hell, dude.
@emef14 You'd have to be naked and rub sunblock all over me and make some pina coladas for me.
@mikebuzek hey I live in FL. I need a pool boy 
@revbuzz57 literally
Anyone want to be my pool boy?
Being a girl has it's perks until pain strikes.
@SFSJoe Good morning, hun <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Lost and insecure, you found me
Someday I will find you in the light at the end of this long darkened tunnel.
Take a bottle drink it down pass it around
Please erase my mind
@Alwayshorny7803 ok
@Alwayshorny7803 really?
Turned on. Thanks to him and my imagination.
I just wrote an erotic story that I actually like because it's about a guy I'm enamored by and the things I wish we could do.
I waited endlessly for our stars to shine and in your eyes I found the heavens.
Let me guide you to where you can wade in the the forever of our love.
Dance with me underneath the patchwork quilt of stars.
You had me at Pearl Jam.
@emef14 top one. Or "Gwen" <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Let me pick your brain 
Ever been so down that music makes ya cry more? Me, neither. Jk
Much to do about something
I'm not the life of the party today. Can't see too well through these tears. Cried all damn morning.
@SFSJoe hi hun
But I'm bipolar, and I hate you maybe.
If you knew, you'd walk away.
@SpeakingofSFL that's why I said we not it, but yes, a tornado
Why is it that we only spiral downward and not upward?
My superpower is crushing on the absolutely wrong guy.
Twitter. Because 
Too tired to pee.
You aren't my type, times new roman
All the good ones are taken.
@block215 me too
@block215 good luck
@block215 meh, I didn't specify anyone, did I?
@chad_brotherton i know. Sigh
Bored!
I need a muse
For my Caelum Love Song-Tesla 
The star I followed and wished upon. 
My evening walk 
@SFSJoe Base hit, but my goals and what I want aren't unfathomable. I'm as low maintenance as they come, hun.
@SFSJoe ya think? <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
My muse, you're not ready for a girl like me.
Caelum 

I wish my light could last
As long as the stars shine
A peek into the past
Forever you've been ... 
Some people are just unaware that they're not safe on the internet.

@TrueFloridian @LoriAGrim @ThaBizzleTeam Bwahaha
@LoriAGrim Can we get a gay dude to use a maple leaf as a french tickler up the Biebs ass then use the Canadian flag to wipe his dick off?
@ThaBizzleTeam @TrueFloridian @LoriAGrim bruh? Wtf?
@LoriAGrim @TrueFloridian @ThaBizzleTeam Yay!
I'm certain you'd fail my kiss test.
@TrueFloridian @ThaBizzleTeam @LoriAGrim oh wait! It's because he knows how insignif Canada is. He's a WMD here, though. Deport him.
@TrueFloridian @ThaBizzleTeam @LoriAGrim Why hasn't that shitbag been deported back to the most insignificant country in the world?
@emef14 impressive haha

I must be the white devil <SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
@TrueFloridian was yours,too
This was a really wild DM. 
Scoring zero points with the guys today. Yay me!
@SFSJoe ah yes.
@TrueFloridian @FatRotty gotta love black racism
The only thing that should settle is dust.
@iWIC3 you look much younger. Happy birthday, kiddo xo
@emef14 ha That's  Spanish for grandchild!
My PI skills are sharp.
Mr. Right does not exist.
@emef14 grandchild?
I've been conned.
Good Night, America
Good Morning, England
So I just learned that lithium and depakote make ya anorgasmic. You poor bipolar fucks!
@JefftheBore1 is there something wrong with you?
@TrueFloridian @JefftheBore1 @RachelAButera uh no thanks
I'll push you away before you hurt me.
I miss your smile and that sparkle in your eyes, you're so beautiful, never change!
@Clifford2008 not
@Clifford2008 @_FloridaMan uh no
Homesick. I miss the ST and I miss my fam. I miss not feeling like the new kid in town.
@TrueFloridian haha
In search of a boyfriend. Apply within
Forever in Absentia and Back Again

I am breaking the

cycle

and letting you know my heart

You feel my ... 
@SpenceCanucks that's ok
@SpenceCanucks I opened the door and you just walked right in
@SpenceCanucks ha
Just a little late, you found me, you found me!
I miss you already...I miss you always
I miss you already...I miss you all day
This is how I feel...
I miss you already...I miss you always
When Mr. Right lives 2950 miles away. Blah!
@Redden420 oh really? Cool!
@Redden420 it's a No Doubt song
'Cause I'm just a girl,little 'ol me 
Don't let me out of your sight 
I'm just a girl,all pretty &amp; petite 
So don't let me have any rights
Thought about when I was a kid and grandpa said the miles can't keep us apart. Tearing up. #suchasap
I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind...i won't change direction and I won't change my mind...How much difference does it make?
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, so why, why, why can't it be mine...
And now my bitter hands shake beneath the clouds of what was everything...
I wish I was the full moon shining off your camaro's hood...
Love boat captain take the reins, steer us towards the clear. I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough: all we need is love, love
Just know this: Pearl Jam isn't just a band, it's a way of life.
Do not mistake lust for love. Lust only hurts if you play that way.
Keeping away from these glowing embers of desire because if you play with fire, you get burned.
Even saints have sinned
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart and shattered dreams.
@Missgwenxoxo either will do
@Alwayshorny7803 thank u <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I dream of being kissed right here 
&lt;---------- This girl <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️s Pearl Jam!
I didn't see this happening and that's what makes it so special.
Holding you is where I wanna be
Where you are is right where you belong, on my mind and in my heart.
Friggin Jets! Ugh! #mnf
Here I am stripped down

Humble and hapless, my purpose, shown

I ache for your warm embrace
Goat on a Mountain

The clouds suddenly barricade the rays of the sun
In essence, it's embrace feels ... 
Our love’s tattered flip book

Is still a page-turner in my mind

The feelings that you took

Away ... 
The intricate pace of the long walk to forever. Learn that when living out your love story.
If ever there is a time

when you are finally free,

could you look inside your heart

with the hope of finding me?
Monday Night Football, going good for the Jets.

Out from the Kuiper Belt 

Soft moans pierce the silence
That had held its breath 
in the ice that formed ... 
Saturn's famed moon, Phoebe, escaped from the Kuiper Belt. The frozen darkness that's left between us, I long to escape.
His lies, blanketed by starlight, blinding my way out of this prison cell.
How Pavlovian, beautifully told lies
@emef14 You should be taken. You are every girl's dream. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@emef14 Maybe it already has. Open your eyes and your heart. In the meantime, I'm always here for you.
Your smile makes the shadows disappear. Please smile for me.
I keep the promises I make until my hand is forced. Keep your fingers entwined in mine.
Trapped in a prison of emotions.
@emef14 I'm sorry, babe
This sun-drenched city and the bluest of skies are a dream for all but I don't care, for without you, beauty is contemptuous.
A beautiful day wasted by the lack of companionship. 
Pieces of you, washed away in my tears.
In my dreams I walk along the shattered life we shared.
Duct tape, but for a broken heart.
I miss his lies and broken promises.                                               Damn you, Christmastime!
In your eyes, I found false hope in an icy blue river of deceit.
Your name on my wrist~my stigmata
You trashed my heart like a rockstar in a hotel room.
Does love come with a money back guarantee?
Your broken heart and tortured soul afloat in a mirage of your yesterdays.
My blood on your hands, your deceit painted red. Sold our wedding bands, and our marital bed.
You'll wear me like a flowing silken shawl of fog when I'm gone. A Cool mist of a memory webbing its way through your eternity.
A lie is the truth walking in a gown of billowing fog.
I tried to stand and walk away, but I fell in love.
The light from the heavens pales in comparison to the love of my children.
I thought you built a shelter from the storms of the world for us.
I've been treading water in this prison of tears.
Who else thinks the moon looks like an English muffin?
Make me the love you seek with your senses
My hands in yours, our fingers entwined, behind closed doors, the love we find
We went through the entire silverware drawer. We spooned and forked and now I just wanna knife him. #happysunday
@custhyabusa it's how I feel
The person you used to spoon with, you want to knife now.
@ejennings6267 thank you!
@SFSJoe lol thanks, but kitchen won't be done until 1st or 2nd week of December
@SHollinsworth @_j_oe yep yep
Happy Thanksgiving!
@PeterLongo the sky. It's beautiful here in Florida. 
@revbuzz57 yep. Snow sucks
@me0wmixalot satan laughs as you eternally rot! Luv slayer!
@dominique64601 yah. I'm in Sarasota county. Snow is the white devil
It's an awesome day. The sun's not hiding anymore and tomorrow will be my first Thanksgiving here in Florida. I've plenty to be Thankful for
Hahahaha 
@dominique64601 typical florida lanai
@dominique64601 thanks!
@dominique64601 thanks for the TL love <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@SpeakingofSFL @RoyalShellFL Hello and welcome!
@MsBreezy306 You're welcome <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@bunksteve Side effects may vary but are not limited to shitting one's self in public and death.
@bunksteve ain't that fucked up? Never trust the FDA.
I want you to pray to god on your death toilet as your ass betrays you with great pain!
@bunksteve skid marks in their tightie whities
@bunksteve Mere mention of it hurts  my brown eye!
Karma will get you, but if not karma, a painful shit. Just know that gift is from me.
@bunksteve no, see, I thought my ex was dead. I was wrong. So now he's just in the litter box enjoying getting pissed and shit on by the cat
@bunksteve sandbox. Litter box is where I buried my ex.
@bunksteve At least you'll "look" clean
@bunksteve Cute as fuck but licking my face will lead to their demise!
Stay home and play in the sandbox with me tomorrow.
@bunksteve My dogs shit a lot, too. They raid the litter box and eat the cat's shit. It's re-shitted shit. Perfect!
@bunksteve It's either that or every car alarm in the area goes off at the same time. It's what the whore deserves. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><THUMBS UP SIGN>
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine in your fucking eyes the next time you have a migraine, bitch!
My dogs stink, but I still cuddle with them like my ex did with his skanky ho.
Two roads diverged in a wood and I chose the one less traveled and that's where I hid the bodies, your honor.
@siamnatural @Paradisemoon100 so, can I throw it on my ex mother in law?
@GodlessLogic haha. Jesus dude, get on your knees!
@GodlessLogic Jesus is a common name in Mexico and mentioned often in cults.
@GodlessLogic Happy Birthday Jesus!
@emef14 thanks. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@emef14 Keep on doing what you do
@GodlessLogic INRI: I'm Nailed Right In
@emef14 Awesome! You don't look out of your 20's.
@GodlessLogic so are our senses of humor. If Jesus step dad was a carpenter, I'm sure there were some severe step-parent, step-child issues.
@emef14 wow, you look too young to have a kid that age! But when I was her age, my dad was a pain. I grew up, though. He's my rock!
@emef14 how old is she?
@GodlessLogic burning ones!
@GodlessLogic true! I bet home depot would make him nervous
@emef14 My advice, do guy things with her and girl things. I still remember building a huge doll house with my dad.
@GodlessLogic Jesus is the dude's name I yell out if the fuck is great.
@GodlessLogic oh n you won't try to preach about Jesus to me.
@GodlessLogic A good deal
@emef14 My dad rules <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@GodlessLogic Just hide your belongings. Those Mexicans are shady.
@GodlessLogic You'd have to be a-friggin-mazing or pull of a few miracles and still, I'd hire some Mexicans to shovel for you.
@GodlessLogic hey, it's fair
@emef14 my dad raised me right
@GodlessLogic In exchange for? Will you help me plant some fruit trees and fix the leaking roof of my lanai?
@GodlessLogic IDK. Snow is the white devil.
I'm tweeting on the toilet. I've basically acted like a guy all day, anyway.
@GodlessLogic Lucky you!
@GodlessLogic A good beer, a good book, or great sex.
I want to be better, stronger, faster, wiser than I was before I met you.
@SpenceCanucks thanks
@emef14 i didn't have mucho dinero, but I saved my money and found good deals
@SpenceCanucks right
@SpenceCanucks ha. Tit for tat? Yes 30
@SpenceCanucks drunk sex is not for me
@SpenceCanucks old enough to know how picky I can afford to be
@SpenceCanucks ewwww. I still have to live with myself
@SpenceCanucks I'm too busy. Too picky. Too tired.
@emef14 yup. I'm a girl doing a kitchen reno, using muscles I really don't have or shouldn't be using!
Last winter broke me with all that snow, so I hear you, Ferguson. I hear you. #whitedevil
My dogs keep raiding my cat's litterbox and eating the shit. Ugh.
@GodlessLogic just to brag
@GodlessLogic I'll post pics often!
@GodlessLogic i got divorced, sold my house, moved here after buying a bank owned property. My life is so awesome now.
#TeamQuackAttack all the way. The only reason I'm taking a break from this kitchen reno!
@GodlessLogic it's why I moved away from Jersey. Hated last winter. It broke me.
@GodlessLogic blah! Snow! The white devil!
@emef14 me too
@GodlessLogic I live In Sarasota county
My two girl doggies are lesbians. 
@GodlessLogic fly into rsw
@revbuzz57 maybe not
@GodlessLogic come on down!
Can I cougar you?
Real women get dirty...during a DIY kitchen reno! 
@SFSJoe yep yep
@SpenceCanucks thanks
@SpenceCanucks unless some sexy guy comes to help my kitchen reno
@SpenceCanucks thanks. I'm knee deep in a kitchen reno, so too busy ATM
@SpenceCanucks really? Lemme see
@SpenceCanucks that's far
@SpenceCanucks FL
@SpenceCanucks haven't been looking and just moved here 2 months ago
@SpenceCanucks I do, but I've not gotten laid in a while
@SpenceCanucks dont we all?
@SpenceCanucks amazing!
@SpenceCanucks Too obvious. And I like to leave my mark haha
@SpenceCanucks you must be young, like 15
@SpenceCanucks but of course
@ImBehaving my 12 y.o daughter's name is Schuyler and she is stunning.
@SpenceCanucks if only
He had fried egg tits and what appeared to be a microwaveable sausage link dick...
And that's how I quit my Denny's addiction.
There should only be gay male cops. That'll shut everyone up about Ferguson.
Use his mom's doilies as cum rags.
Would Home Depot make Jesus nervous?
@block215 exactly!
If you let him jerk off on your face, smile and wink at him when you meet his mother
If you want to talk after having sex, you're not my type
If you can talk after having sex, you fuck up.
Red, red rag you're staying in the supine, collecting the goop dripping from my vagine
My monthly visitor makes a huge mess and leaves what appears to be pomegranate guts and bold doritos crumbs all over my bed.
The red meat only a vampire would eat.
I think Aunt Flo is a misnomer. It should be called The Red Vag of Courage.
I want a no strings attached relationship, so yeah, don't fuck with me when I'm riding the cotton pony.
Hey cunt, stick a maxipad with wings to your back and fly out the top window of a tall building.
I guess Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney were wrong: ebony and ivory do not live together in perfect harmony. #Ferguson

-sext
@bunksteve possibly! Maybe his tail is hiding in those spanx.
@bunksteve mine is a manx
@bunksteve My cat rules the world already and he's only 3 months old.
@bunksteve We'd starve everyone! Mankind destroyed. World hunger solved.
@bunksteve and the new color would be burnt boobs. See how well we've worked together? Me neither.
@bunksteve I hope it wasn't the part about the children. I mean,a burned minivan with kids in it,so not a turn on. Candle wax on boobs maybe
@bunksteve ut oh. Some broad in a Neon ran you down.
Were there any children in the Sienna when it burned?Toyota used to make a nice minivan
@bunksteve Tortoise is not a color. Turquoise is. Neons are also signs...of bad drivers.
@bunksteve neon was a dodge compact car. Don't confuse things! Turquoise is the third color.
@bunksteve hahaha it's a beige color. But not a nice shade.
@bunksteve bwahaha. That's golden!
@Jedizaugg thank you <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@Jedizaugg thanks. Account got hacked. My ex is a jerk
@bunksteve Commando is the way to go!
@bunksteve These aren't my underwear. I'm an excellent driver. K-Mart sucks.
@bunksteve headphones not included
@bunksteve keep making that face and it'll freeze!
@bunksteve very nice
@bunksteve face? What is wrong with it?
@bunksteve cute
@bunksteve OMG corey feldman flick
@bunksteve is that you? Cool cake!
@bunksteve u do that. I'm gonna go watch Joseph Campbell interviewed by George Lucas at  Skywalker Ranch dvd
@bunksteve Yup the ‘Fort Detmerring’ scene. Blonde Ghost giving RY head. Ray wore a French military jacket
@bunksteve Did you know the original script, entitled Ghostmashers was deemed too expensive to film and written to star Belushi &amp; Candy?
@bunksteve BYW, did you know Zulu n Slimer were voiced by Ivan Reitman?
@bunksteve Aykroyd murray Ramis. Don't touch my Cabbage Patch dolls!
@bunksteve Hey! I have Ghostbusters memorabilia! A signed  poster!
Nerdy moi 
Had a great night! Love nights like this! Peace out! <VICTORY HAND>️
Dear Florida, I've never felt prettier. Thank you.
Live music at Dean's tex mex! 
@emef14 thank u. Funeral to attend Sunday.
Have a wonderful weekend, everybody. Driving to NJ.
In this light, you'll remain perfect, even after nightfall.
Contact me anyway you know how @morgansphoenix. Thank you and again I am@sorry for the mess I did not create. He's an embarrassment.
Again, anything he's done I have no part in. He hacked my google, FB and twitter accounts. I want a quiet life, as do you @morgansphoenix
I am being dragged into something I want no part of and if you have proof for me, my dad will also help you out @morgansphoenix
I'd like to say a heartfelt "I'm sorry" to @morgansphoenix for everything. I know I said I don't forgive anyone, but that was years ago
So, I'm playing solitaire on the laptop in my bed and my phone rings...my ex is in the hosp. Fuck that. #Smile #idgaf 
Another sleepless night. Guess I'll play solitaire on the 'puter.

Florida has been good to me. Never felt prettier.
