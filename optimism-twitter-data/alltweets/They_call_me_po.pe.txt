Yelling at my brother through my door every night as he walks through the hallway will be something I truly miss

@SenorKelsey everyday future thanks to his Spanish grade 
@SenorKelsey to his grade book

@shelbieyoung Lee and I have been sharing funny videos since the beginning of time

@SenorKelsey about his Spanish grade 
@SenorKelsey except Señora is God 
@SenorKelsey talking to his points in Spanish 
@SenorKelsey B in Spanish 
Just kidding I ain't a bitch

Roasting kyle for his B will be my summer
@SenorKelsey except you got a B in Spanish so what happens for you? Mediocre work? 
@haterunning33 a fucking rotten fossilized hard apple, incapable of feeling
@haterunning33 shit I bruised easily back then fam. That was back when I was like a nice person too. Before I died on the inside
@Maisenburg @acheray7 
@Gus84Gus @ellllbelllll you're welcome. See you at Buffalo Wild Wings
@CameronsCastle you're RTs are disabled....not sure if by accident or on purpose as a cruel joke....
@Maisenburg @acheray7 she needs a bigger push 
Was this really how highschool started? I'm glad my grammar has improved...I want to punch the old me 
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly it's like we're women and men
Will these memories fade when I leave this town?
The fact that I'll never have one of those bomb ass summers with @LeezyEstrada @Daniel_Son1224 @jsanch0811 and #twitterlessMatt again
@larascott55 his baby bird is leaving the nest
@ellllbelllll bet

Whereas for the deflatriots the NFL punishments will be the only ones they receive
Domestic abuse is different from deflating footballs. Domestic abuse will have off field punishments along with those issues by the NFL
@SenorKelsey @CameronsCastle KYS
For the record I like the junior class too but I've liked them since they were freshman so it's not really new news

FAV - NO

#DeflateGate 
@SenorKelsey @CameronsCastle I want a special message

@yungdictator I'm going to work
@NateDye71  
@yungdictator that B in Spanish doe
So many senior pictures to hand out still
@yungdictator your speaking in technical statistic terms I'm speaking in Psychology terms
@yungdictator that's life. It's just full of fleeting moments. Keep your head up during the bad and cherish the good moments along the way
@shelbieyoung you'll notice my *scene correction I tweeted you peasant
@shelbieyoung bish 
@They_call_me_po *scene
The only scene that gets me more is the fresh prince one where Will talks to uncle Phil about his dad
The seen in How I Met Your Mother where Marshalls father dies gets me every time. It's such a well acted scene
@yungdictator regression to the mean. It'll get better buddy
So I'm getting a B in Spanish. Are they gonna come take my cords away from my house or how does this work?
2 days...
@Maisenburg fair enough. Carry on
2 days
The only thing I like about Facebook is that there's no character limit and if I need to post some real shit I'm not restricted
NewtonHighSchwitz is the concrete
You wouldn't ask why the rose that grew through the concrete had damaged petals. We are the roses these are our petals
@Maisenburg a bit?
If you had alerted to me that you wanted a senior picture with a message they will be available tomorrow. I also have extras to give
I only need like a 5% on this project to get an A
Was gonna do my English stuff tonight but I left my folder at school. Atleast I did my Wanted poster I can bs the boast before school
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@SenorKelsey @Young_Swagg59 I'll leave you guys sleepin
1st day of summer came fast guys 
If you have something to say to me I suggest you say it soon
Writing on senior pictures is so sad when you know the times you see your friends will be few and far in between. 2 more days guys
Okay starting senior pictures. If you want a message speak now or forever hold your peace

@BurbrinkCasey actually it was red
They're playing one of the Zelda soundtrack songs before the movie and I noticed it cause I'm a nerd
@BurbrinkCasey #gogetpancakedbyaDL
I care if your snapchat is 1000 seconds long. Never do that 
@BurbrinkCasey your mom should regret having a middle child
@BurbrinkCasey I hope she never calls you out of weights again
@BurbrinkCasey you don't say that shit to your mom on mothers day is my point. Just be a good son.
@BurbrinkCasey who gives a shit who made the holiday? all the shit your parents do for you and you can't take 2 days a year to thank each?
Been waiting forever to watch Avengers 2. Let's go
@BurbrinkCasey you're a fuck head homie

@Thomas_Casey123 bro it's only 1250. You gotta fix your clock homie
@acheray7 @SenorKelsey if you zoom in on this year you can really see the change 
I feel like people actually hate me and kyle on twitter
@trista_stark 
@SenorKelsey @acheray7 and you're over here standing up in the bed of trucks riding around all dangerous and shit
@SenorKelsey @acheray7 also a year ago you would have been safe from a nuke
@SenorKelsey @acheray7 also you have a bracelet this year
When @SenorKelsey tells you to fav and RT something but you don't see it till later and don't know which tweet so you do them all
Every time I've talked with someone about senior pictures I've used the term "bet"
@SenorKelsey @noah_shit  
@KadeRemsberg  
@shelbieyoung honestly walking around that show makes you realize how much you wish you could do that stuff
@shelbieyoung It's hard to pick what of yours I liked best. The Beatles stuff was cool but the Earl and Tyler paintings were so good
I don't know how many are on but the art show was really good! Props to @shelbieyoung @ellllbelllll @haterunning33 @Baby_G_97
Learning how to play squares and cut
@LeezyEstrada on my way to em now. I'll swing fam
@LeezyEstrada stfu
@haterunning33 bet

@shelbieyoung what time?
@haterunning33 I'll get my BB gun

Bring me Drubers so I know it's real
@evankels just wanted to make sure you're safe. Los manos arriba
@NateDye71 @Kaepernick7 without rules society would be chaos. Protect the sacrity of the game
@NateDye71 @Kaepernick7 it's about the integrity of the game
Who has grad parties tomorrow? And who wants to party hop with me?
@evankels

@BurbrinkCasey kyle says no
@ReaganMcCloud1 keep your head in the game. Maintain focus through the rain delay! LOCK IT IN! 
Currently sitting in breadbasket, I'm definitely the only minority in sight.....on a plus the food is good
And newton and wichita police are worried about Marijuana 
Hey you, yeah you. Tu es mi media naranja
@They_call_me_po @bdowney33 @NolanBrill33
Guys Noah has never seen Joe Dirt. When you see him roast him....hard
@ellllbelllll did you pay the fee?
Don't want people to read the stuff I'm gonna write on the grad pics with me there. It's gonna be sappy and very unMichael like
@ellllbelllll I say 15 times. Every night we relieve that night
@danawild7 @acheray7 my first thought was this 
@acheray7 closets and under beds should be 1st looking spots for an inside game. My stepdad use to hide somewhere that to this day idk where
@ellllbelllll @yunggravyy definitely. That was a fun night
@RegierLauren @dawsynkristyne @AlyssaLynn_9 I think baseball won... 
@yunggravyy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I own this now. Yes
@BurbrinkCasey @Thomas_Casey123 @BestVlNES this dude hella got a modded controller for COD man
@ellllbelllll I'm in for sure
@acheray7 are you sure theyre playing with you and you're not just standing behind the curtain giggling? Not that that's ever happened to me
@Thomas_Casey123 @BestVlNES I wanna see the target and how inaccurate that shit is
@ellllbelllll right? He leaves June 4th I think
@acheray7 haha they all went inside to have tea and watch TV
@acheray7 just gonna diss your fam like that? #savage
@ellllbelllll I'd say we better do it before Noah leaves but idk if he would
@ellllbelllll best was the flashlight version at night
@CameronsCastle remember when you fucked your leg up at Haydens playing hide and seek?
I miss playing hide and seek
@Jules_Pierce @landonyoung30 minus the fat

@SenorKelsey @SincerelyTumblr jennifer and Mike will always let me in
@SenorKelsey yours and Noah's house 
@thejerodfox backwards ass people man. Like to pick and choose what from the Bible they'll live their lives by and what they won't. Some BS
@Maisenburg @acheray7 @m10_oller you'll receive no pity from me as you spit on my heritage with your immature jokes
@teamtkelso you'd have a B though right?
@Maisenburg @acheray7 @m10_oller you disgust me <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I laughed too haed 
@teamtkelso  
@acheray7 @Maisenburg @m10_oller isn't life really about tacos though? (Even though tacos aren't even my top 10 mexican food)
@ellllbelllll have tried talking to him like as a group intervention wise?
@ellllbelllll just realized this is a serious tweet. Can't let people ruin your life even if it's parents. Gotta keep your head up muchacha
@Maisenburg @acheray7 @m10_oller tacos are nothing to joke about...it's a cornerstone of my heritage, never EVER disrespect the taco
@Maisenburg I like to think I'm everyone's friend. Except the juniors...I hate you guys (and gals I ain't sexist I hate you all equally)
@luischavez6464 you a savage homie
@teamtkelso @NHSNewtonian you ight. 2 out of 10 for sure
@luischavez6464 I'll get a mob together and lynch you right now
@teamtkelso @NHSNewtonian sucks to suck
@NHSNewtonian I have to go take a test in Umscheids and I don't think you wanna bother her during seminar
@luischavez6464 good thing I'm transferring
@trista_stark @MOVIEMEMORlES good you've got a long life ahead...I'd hate for you to "fall down the stairs"
@NHSNewtonian where can a homie cop one of those bad boys?
@luischavez6464 I'll kill you in your sleep
@trista_stark @MOVIEMEMORlES I don't got time for that...plus Naruto's on Netflix so I've been channeling my inner nerd. Don't tell anyone
@Maisenburg @acheray7 @m10_oller never sour cream on tacos....ever
This is my favorite movie ever. You don't even understand, I could watch this every day 
People complaining about FST tests when they get to use notes on it. Please tell me more about how rough your test life is
@Maisenburg I hate you
@teamtkelso  
@ReaganMcCloud1 I heard you got dat pink eye fam
@josef_voth you like to see homos naked?
Probably gonna throw up on Dillons floor
@thejerodfox 
Screw school today. I just wanna sleep
RFT 
My dog would be biting me so fast. This doge is too cute 
Well AP Exams are done but now finals start...honestly I hate my life
@CameronsCastle  
It's still going. Will the notifications ever end? 
How is this shit awesome? That things gonna go mess someone up 
When you're trying to get your mom to call you out after the AP Exam and she says no but you both know she's going to
These AP Exams got me so drained. Today will make 12 hours of testing in 3 days and I still have finals this week :/
@ellllbelllll 
#SeniorYearIn5Words "You look like Fat Bastard"
@SenorKelsey "Donut Whole is right there"
@Maisenburg not true. We made a meth deal. I've accomplished everything in life anyways, I accept the blissfulness of death
@SenorKelsey "I have a Dillons card"
Just ready to go home tomorrow and watch #Naruto
@michaelvela_1 I don't know but his maxes aren't that bad!
#SeniorYearIn5Words "I don't wanna be here"
@thejerodfox @LilM_FrmThePack Clippers, Warriors, Cavs, Wizards. Cavs versus warriors championship. Cavs take it even without Love
Reminder to all seniors to go sign up and pay for the senior all night party. Amount increases to 30 dollars after Friday. Don't miss out
@LilM_FrmThePack Cleveland deserves a title
@datmarisaharris I just hope he doesn't block me
I think Im funny &amp; make obvious yet funny pop reference jokes. Gonna carry this positive attitude into that exam and get a 5, or atleast a 3
@a_luckyluck  
@allicat_26 that's better than a 49%
@allicat_26 you just gotta wing it. That's always served me well
@allicat_26 I've had too many of those. Won't miss them
@thejerodfox I thought of this too. I almost added "like Noah gives me everyday at lunch" but I figured no one would understand
@haterunning33 shit you got me there
@m10_oller <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> (a bow of thanks)
I'll tag the pity tags...I already peaked in highschool, pity is my life now
@haterunning33 I'll swing
@haterunning33 that's racist. You're a racist now
Just want to mean enough for someone to tag me in one of Lauren Sanderson's tweets #LifeGoals
@ellllbelllll up in here?
Since I'm Mexican do I get added points to my #APEnglish  exam tomorrow? Last one, let's get it
@Maisenburg I didn't think I'd be that guy that peaked in highschool. Ironically AP exams for my future caused my downfall
@haterunning33 fucking savage. Use a "!!!!NEW GIRL SPOILER!!!!!" Alert at the beginning of your tweet next time
@GabeSchrag @BurbrinkCasey @KaylaCapper fuck that's sophomore year Casey too
The fact that I'll never be as famous as I was on twitter today <PENSIVE FACE> I have nothing left to accomplish in life
@itsHIMYMquotes @acheray7 *weekend at barneys* 
Someone commented that when they couldn't open their seals they felt like Will Smith in MIB <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I totally forgot about that scene
So I'll never get more RTs or Favs than today
Also if you plan on @ ing me don't plan on me responding too quickly. My notifications are getting flooded
Naruto is on Netflix! Everything in my world is good now
@thejerodfox They're still coming in too 
Honestly the hardest part about the #APCalc test was removing the seals on Part B
I have no planner thanks to @SenorKelsey  
AP Calc test in 48 minutes. Anyone wanna run away to Mexico with me?
@kelby_lawrence @acheray7 it's because of all the trying to feed Ryan cereal through the TV videos
@thejerodfox @haterunning33 move to San Francisco and become a hobo. Or move to Los Angeles and sing Under The Bridge
@ReaganMcCloud1 they wanted to expose the ignorant like kobe exposes weak ankles
@ReaganMcCloud1 the fact that a majority of that pages followers got it wrong worries me
@ReaganMcCloud1 @ComedyOrTruth because if your quoting means RT as in 10, then you are once again wrong and deserving of an Umscheid stare
@ReaganMcCloud1 @ComedyOrTruth which is it?
I think once I finish these AP exams it's really gonna set in that this is it
AP Calcers! Ready your beds and sleep well... For tomorrow, we dine in hell!

It's a sad day in Honors Chemistry II when you submit your last article report ever #RIP 
I wish I played baseball just so I could yell dinger everytime I popped up
AP Psychology <HEAVY CHECK MARK>. Just 2 more exams to go
How young KCB's quest for 2 bananas played out 
I'll take dumb questions for 500 
@BurbrinkCasey @ellllbelllll they have the same prices

We struggle so hard to hold on to these things that we know are gonna disappear eventually. And that’s really noble.
@acheray7 but the blue french horn... 
Am I the only one that likes the ending to How I Met Your Mother?
@Thomas_Casey123 bro just enjoy that last highschool summer
@drew_goerzen6 judge me but I liked it. Ted and Robin were meant to be
I don't think I'll ever stop enjoying How I Met Your Mother. It's one of the few true joys in life
Nah, home is where you make it.
Ya like ta see homos naked?
Home is where you make it.
You like ta see homos naked, thats cool man, whatever
Yeah, you want a match? My face and your ass! How 'bout that friend? Huh? I mean, your ass and my face, what's up?
It puts the lotion on it's skin or else it gets the hose again.
You're gonna stand there, ownin' a fireworks stand, and tell me you don't have no whistlin' bungholes, spleen splitters, whisker biscuits...

Too real 
@thejerodfox 
@SenorKelsey @TheAlexRickard this isn't a time for violence. Your parents should be congratulating your graduation, not mourning your death
Gonna enjoy this last week and a half (minus the finals and AP tests of course)
I came into this school from SMCS knowing only a handful of people. I've met so many more along the way. Honestly gonna miss this school
For every bad memory at NHS I have 20 good ones
Even at their worst I liked all of them and knew they honestly did care about their students even if they seemed illogical at times
Like it's been a rough year with the administration and I don't agree with everything they've been trying to do but I'm gonna miss them
Is next week really the last full week I'll ever go to Newton High?
@TheAlexRickard true
Is it just me or has it been a short ass weekend?

@landonyoung30 @WalmartG @RivalsWoody that was a good set young fella. Youre lookin big LXNDY. You should quit baseball you got an OL future
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Honestly wish Pac could go back and capitalize on that momentum from round 3 when he stunned Mayweather. Instead he lost the momentum
People that don't appreciate good defense from a boxer. They're just here to see KO punches.
Lol at people saying pac got robbed. He definitely lost that fight. Pac let Mayweather set the tempo. Didn't fight his fight
@KernAlex your grammar is as good as Mayweather's
@LeezyEstrada so true. All the great boxers had several fights
Would of loved to see that fight 5 years ago
@MannyPacquiao still the people's champ. Great effort. Floyds defense is just too good
Need a KO
Gotta turn it on Pac
Mayweather is happy with a card win. Gotta go get it pac. Comeone
Fuck yes let's go get him pac
Come on pac let's get it
You know Mayweather got money to blow when he's wearing shit like that
@Hugovaldivia23 I'm even talk about past fighter like as a person
Pacquiao deserves this win. What a journey, how can you not want to cheer for this guy? #TeamPacquiao
@Young_Swagg59 bet
@_nataliademitri deuces
Is this you? Do you not know what to do? I have the answer, watch the fight of the generation #MayPac

Just worked out with Noah for 3 hours. Idk the last time I was this tired
Deadlift circuit. Jump rope, burpies. Tractor tire workouts. Pushups. And he says we're only half way done
Will pay someone to go get me Starbucks  
@HaileyValdez1 you have like 2 customers a day
@HaileyValdez1 where do you work?
I'm all calced out
I don't wanna be awake
@ellllbelllll it's that red dye
I'd like to blame my boring night on having an AP Exam tomorrow morning but tbh I don't have friends so I'd probably be at home anyways
Idk how I feel about that pick. We'll see though
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
And the love will never get lost
@Ludacris @vindiesel 
So proud of our boys tonight. Great group of guys deserving of those big wins. Lot of games left but I hope they enjoy a senior night sweep
Seems like a smart guy too. I like this pick
Wide Receiver. I like it, let's train him up
@thejerodfox @_SarahMcFarlane I knew this yesterday
@Young_Swagg59 doubtful. Barney's get psych mix is legendary
@acheray7 it's people like you that ruin the world
@mariahfesler in order of how much I'd dislike you would be raiders, chargers, patriots, broncos
I'll be there with my undying support. Let's get em boys 
@bdowney33 @ReaganMcCloud1 #fakefriend
@mariahfesler depends on who you like
@mariahfesler oh undoubtedly. Non chiefs fans have to drink out of the hose at my house

@Maisenburg as long as the pick keeps his off field issues to a minimum. Yes
@_SarahMcFarlane yes

@dawsynkristyne you can have chocolate syrup, whipped cream, caramel, sprinkles, peanuts, and even another scoop if you give me summer
@SamManBball9605 
@dawsynkristyne I'd probably even toss cherries on top for it to be summer. I don't take cherry tossing lightly either
@dawsynkristyne what if I ask really nicely?
I don't want to set the world on fire

@snappinglong @FightsOnVine one understands
@SenorKelsey @landonyoung30 @shelbieyoung hey bitch I'm Front End Supervisor
@shelbieyoung prime example. Maybe 20% are good at their job
Okay I'm done ranting. Just can't stand how backwards rioting is in the attempt at social reform. Or how crippling to a community it is
And yeah there's bad cops but please show me a profession where there aren't fuck ups who don't do their job right
Like my heart goes out for every fucked up thing that's happened but it's not the right way to handle it
When you riot all you're doing is giving into the racist people's thoughts or you. "Oh you're just savages" or "you're naturally violent"
How many of the "protesters" are just there to loot also? Revealing the hate in a man's heart is not the way to create social change
@thejerodfox @ReaganMcCloud1 <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
In what backwards sense does destroying and looting a damn community improve the community? It's not the right way to do it
@kaalikat oh so these riots aren't spurred on by the Gray incident with police? Or against the government which is the police?
Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction... - Gandhi
Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend. - MLKJ
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. - MLKJ
@kaalikat so burning your neighbors cars and destroying and looting a place of business with in the community shows the police? Fuck that
I'm all for social change and protests but what's the point of violent riots in which you're  destroying your own fucking community?

@dawsynkristyne a quarter is worth 250 percent more than a dime. That classifies as high roller

Not saying some should, but I wouldn't be dissapointed if a group of people tagged #FreeNate on everyone's cars. #waystomakemikehappy
I also ask those w/ official Nate Dye produced #FreeNateDye Tees wait to get pictures till others have come. By 820 they will be open to all
Again I only have around 35 of these papers so I encourage people to print out their own as well. 
I should be in the 2nd level of the commons by 8 tomorrow I will be on the West side (by the cafeteria) I will have tape and papers ready

Can school just not today? Like no one wants to be there
@wyattburbs_3 fuck no

@KansasPregame @sportsinkansas @KadeRemsberg @snappinglong @kt_powerlifting
Hope I didn't have any homework this weekend
@RealSlimTerrel please never come back to newton
For real guys  
Everyone in Newton is gonna be Spaking now thanks to Justin. This is why I hate Marion kids

@ReaganMcCloud1 If the cat was a chipmunk it'd resemble you better
@ally_tozier he/she could become twitter famous
Special 420 RT 
@Maisenburg oh but it was
@ally_tozier video or it didn't happen
Justin's looking to get pressed awake by me and kyle again. Only this time it's from sleep to awake to death

@theeledesma @acheray7 I was so embarrassed. Good thing my car isn't nice or I would have been mad instead of embarrassed
@theeledesma @acheray7 *hit big ass dip on Ash Road* 
Erika- Yeah there's a dip there
Me- Yeah you don't say
@theeledesma @acheray7 me on Saturday  
RIP a legend 
I love Full House. Judge me
Honestly just looking forward to going home and going to bed
@allicat_26 RT
@allicat_26 try wichita. Or dallas. Or San Diego
Besides there's enough heat from all the lighters in town. I don't need to add the heat from my fiery roasts
Idk why but I'm like really salty right now and every tweet I see I just wanna roast them. So it's probably best if I just go to bed
And by God I of course mean me
And then God descends from the heavens and gives me the ability to skip to the weekends
Hoping I wake up tomorrow and this weekend was a dream and it's Friday at 330 again
@haterunning33 happy half birthday faggit
If I smoke a cigar does that count?
To all you deviants be safe tonight. Don't get caught by the Man. Personally I'll just be going to bed though. Have a good one guys
<WHALE>- You're the only emoji dm I'm responding to because I fucking hate you. You know who you are...KYS
@thejerodfox  
@evankels  
@ReaganMcCloud1 If Mayweather wins I'm punching you in the face several times as hard as I can
Yes please 

So you're trying to get me to eat yoga mats....I'm in 
@NateDye71  
His name tag is his twitter handle. Lol @thejerodfox  
Don't have any pictures to send anyone because @Lukeporter0976 broke my camera the same night he gave me a concussion
@kaalikat @shelbieyoung swing homie
@kaalikat @shelbieyoung #valleysucks
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, thanks to you
I think I'm gonna watch the first episode of a series and then the last episode of the series. Getting wild #turnup
Fav for LeBron 
Anyone wanna go lick the Liberty Bell? It'll be legendary guys
@Lukeporter0976 you don't know where I live anyways
@Lukeporter0976 I realize that could be taken as a sexual inuendo. I mean to say there's no chairs in my room. Just my bed
@Lukeporter0976 unless you plan on chilling in my bed that's a no go
Stuck between wishing I had friends to hang out with right now and just chillazing at home
When you realize that Izzy from Grey's Anatomy is in The Ringer <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I wish I could live the rest of my life like it was a highschool weekend
Kyle's gonna gain a hundred pounds this summer guys 
You guys took the bait. Also kyle broke the chair trying to steal food 
@jchall_3 I imagine that seat has "Reserved for Justin 'The Trash' Terrell" etched on it by a pocket knife
@jchall_3 actually we hid his body in the dump. We figured trash belongs with trash
VIVAAAAAA!! 
@jchall_3 too late kyle and I already pressed him to death
Happy birthday @jchall_3 !!!! My birthday present is to never let Justin go back to Marion
Watching tommy boy with the bros to end a good freaking day <OK HAND SIGN>
So if someone has a picture of me please send it to me. Thanks fam. If you don't send me a pic I hate you
Really fun night. Good way to end the year. Probably just gonna skip every day of school now
So weird that @RealSlimTerrel birthday was the day after prom. Everyone wish our lil buddy a good one
@warren_dietz @TheCodyStineman where's the zoom ins? And the photo creds ya dick
@SenorKelsey also to celebrate @RealSlimTerrel birthday. Happy birthday bud
If you're looking to have fun tonight come over to @SenorKelsey house to hang
@siiiiiiidthekid I love you
@Maisenburg @RayNarvaezJr idk if I know enough about computers and shit to do it though. I'm wicked on a controller doe
@Maisenburg @RayNarvaezJr shit count me in to play games and make jokes for a living. After all they need a new minority.
@Maisenburg @RayNarvaezJr right?! It'll take awhile to adjust. Idk. I wish they could get Kerri to take the chair but he's too busy
@Maisenburg @RayNarvaezJr what they do is what I wish I could do. It's the dream &amp; he walked away. 1st Monty now ray leaves. AH is declining
Probably no one is gonna know what I'm refrencing, but I'm gonna miss @RayNarvaezJr so much on AH. Not gonna be the same again #letsstop

&lt;3
#KB24 
@warren_dietz gonna be plenty of more chances. George isnt gonna give up because of a bad day. You're a freshman. You'll get over the nerves
@ReaganMcCloud1 = best closer in Kansas
Idk why everyone is wishing @thejerodfox a happy birthday. His birthday was yesterday guys
@wyattburbs_3 obviously so
Okay twitter I'm outta here. So this tweet hereby states any tweets at me after this will not be replied to because I'll be asleep
Tomorrow's gonna be a preworkout kinda morning #itswaytoolate
All challengers are welcomed. Come one come all have your shot at the fat man 
Okay I'm done with my rant. ELE guys #everybodyloveeverybody
@BurbrinkCasey once a snitch always a snitch 
I declare tomorrow as #nationalhugnatedyeday cause he needs some love and support. I'll be awarding COTY points as I see fit
If your fellow man is struggling don't kick him while he's down. Laugh at the damn joke with him and give him a damn hug.
Excuse nate for trying to make a joke to try and brighten his day after a shitty week.
Apperently from now on whenever something bad happens you have to be down and hate life and not try to make light out of it
Lynching has a racial stigma attached to it but know this is not a hate crime.
@Young_Swagg59 @BurbrinkCasey bruh same race. It makes it okay
@landonyoung30 @ConnorrG15 that's why you gotta do it Mexico style and bribe the cops
Nate Dye is gonna have to take that L and get lynched so I can use his funeral to launch my movement to the national spotlight
@NateDye71 @BurbrinkCasey what our movement really needs is a heartfelt sob story. I'm already preparing my speech for your funeral
@BurbrinkCasey it's not racist as long as everyone is part white (because nate is white)
@drew_goerzen6 @GabeSchrag I have a surplus supply of ski masks. I give them out no questions asked...
@ConnorrG15 oh fuck she definitely did then. If you date or are friends with a pothead you're a pothead. It's the transitional law of pot
@ConnorrG15 I bet Tammy's puffed once in her youth, after all she's mexican
@BurbrinkCasey @trista_stark I've got rope if you're looking to form a lynching party
@ConnorrG15 you're Mexican cannabis already runs in your blood fam. It's too late
@BurbrinkCasey @trista_stark I've never heard of anyone else at NHS smoking dope. He's the biggest problem mayne
@BurbrinkCasey yeah can't bring in something that doesn't exist anyways
@ConnorrG15 plus potential fines and court and diversion and drug tests. Trust me when I say it'll be a pain in his ass
@trista_stark I hope he dies. He's a pothead scumbag. It's a gateway drug, he'll be on meth in no time
@ConnorrG15 I think taking a man's door is going too far. He's gonna get plenty of punishment. Lost his car and will have community service
@ConnorrG15 bruh he was making a joke. God forbid anyone do that on twitter nowadays. Isn't social media a place to vent also?
@ConnorrG15 my argument isn't about punishment. It's about treating someone as less than you for getting arrested for it
To the boy with the cross on his arm Wasnt cannabis created by God to be used by his people. There are bible refrences. So God or Government
Also a majority of the cops (who I have the upmost respect for) enforcing the law broke it when they were younger.
I'm not gonna tell you to go get arrested or "blaze up" live your life how you want but don't turn around and judge others for theirs
The only way to change things is to challenge them. If you live your life without toeing or crossing the line you never really lived
Breaking the law and being delinquent is in fact the road to social change. You think sit ins during the Civil rights was legal?
@landon_m00re @ConnorrG15 so that you guys can brush up on all the things you shouldn't do because it's the law @DumbLawz
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re legalizing Marijuana solves so many problems you don't even understand. Which is why it's slowly being legalized
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re ever gona over 20 on main street? That's breaking the law
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re ever had possession of a sharpie? That's illegal, it's a graffiti tool not for minors
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re ever played fantasy football for money? Broke the law
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re ever downloaded illegal music? Broke the law
@ConnorrG15 @landon_m00re so you've never sung "happy birthday" in public? That's breaking a law you know? Violated copyright.
@landon_m00re you're such a fucking stuff. I'm not advocating breaking the law. I'm advocating social reform, question wrongful laws
@SenorKelsey @landonyoung30 yeah you sack of shit
@landon_m00re please reference where I said no consequences? Then get back to me
@SenorKelsey @landonyoung30 not you buddy I <GROWING HEART> you
Like Im not saying kill a man or drop acid and do coke but question authority and society. Don't take something as given because they say so
If you live in a world thats black and white, Good and bad, I truly feel for you. I hope at some point you can open your mind and truly live
Landon I have a step tool in my kitchen if you need help climbing down from that high horse you're riding. #tooselfrighteous
@landon_m00re @NateDye71 a refresher course many of you ignorant people seem to need at NHS 
@landon_m00re @NateDye71 I think there's more important things to deal with in this fucked up world than a 16 year old smoking pot
@SenorKelsey @landon_m00re @NateDye71 I'm gonna leave this here 
@SenorKelsey @landon_m00re @NateDye71 I see what you did there
@landon_m00re @NateDye71 imo Marijuana shouldn't be illegal. Or if it is so should alcohol and nicotine.
@SenorKelsey @landon_m00re @NateDye71 *Judaism. It's a bad choice. They got that cool top thing (dredel) and candle (minorah)
@landon_m00re @NateDye71 nate didn't know he'd lose his door. Door=holocaust in this situation
#takenatesbed
@landon_m00re @NateDye71 those people chose to be Jewish
@LeezyEstrada @SenorKelsey it's the 21st century though so it's okay
@LeezyEstrada I have no comment on that specific action it is out of my domain of approved twitter material
@LeezyEstrada @SenorKelsey A. They agree you're a queer. B. Kyle and I are funny as hell and twitter famous. C. We referenced cyber bullying
Probably gonna get called down to kingwood community in Texas by @LeezyEstrada administration for cyber bullying him
@SenorKelsey @LeezyEstrada bruh I'm half
@LeezyEstrada @SenorKelsey only steers and queers in Texas and I don't see no horns on you boy
@LeezyEstrada @SenorKelsey they must let anyone in nowadays
@landonyoung30 *no
@landonyoung30 I have to response
@LeezyEstrada @SenorKelsey he asked where you went to college
@landonyoung30 if a man just laid down and took his punishment we'd still have slavery, US would still be in depression, Hitler would rule
@SenorKelsey @LeezyEstrada I said that your parents MIGHT move to Canada, so you were considering going to KU. Never that you were Canadian
@landonyoung30 gonna put that bad mojo on our movement to help a friend down on his luck
@landonyoung30 you ain't right for that

@thejerodfox @Riley_Kingsley @ReaganMcCloud1 is there a way to go for just 66.67 percent of the group?
@thejerodfox happy birthday
@thejerodfox @Riley_Kingsley @ReaganMcCloud1 is there a Facebook invite with the wrong time?
PSA that study session started a minute ago and I haven't left my house yet
Just gotta get through this calc study session and it's clear sailing.
@ConnorrG15  
@GrafJordyn you are literally too dumb. I'm friends with the underclassmen. Please try again
@GrafJordyn it was a joke. You keep saying to grow up and be mature but you can't comprehend what a joke is? Good lord
Shit Thunder didn't make the playoffs
When people are too stupid to comprehend a joke &lt;&lt;&lt;
@GrafJordyn please gtfo out okay? I'm done with you girls and fucking up lives. I'm not here to get charged with cyber bullying. Good day.
Okay I'm done now. I'm so tired. Good thing tomorrow is game day. In which I will have the most enthusiasm and dominate
@Arron_Holeman you've got spunk kid
@Arron_Holeman yeah. Let's be honest seminar would be pre ftt boring without you 2 and nic
If you refused to turn off the heater in Miss Bergman's. You won't be missed
If we've discussed football together you'll be missed
If you've ever spent the night at Noah's house with me. You'll be missed
@HaileyValdez1 I've revoked thar lifestyle. I bring peace to the world now. Probably gonna weave a grass crown for school tomorrow
When @ReaganMcCloud1 thanks everyone (yes literally everyone) for his success, except his coach....awkward...
@Maisenburg coming from a long line of mispronounced/misspelled names I prefer to keep people's names as sacred and ask you do so aswell
@HaileyValdez1 that's better
@m10_oller @Maisenburg I tweeted before you....this is awkaward. Sorry, not sorry 
@Maisenburg not sorry
@Maisenburg sorry
@yung_historian I'm like an onion. You have to peel me back. Recent events opened me up and now my pungent deepness is exposed.
@Daniel_DAustin follow me
@yung_historian love your fellow man unconditionally and good things will come. Karma will in the end balance everything. Kumbaya my friend
@yung_historian cast out the log in your own eye before you condemn your brother for the speck in his eye
I want to make clear my tweets tonight are in a general sense and part of a rant. If you feel victimized in any way please alert me first
@yung_historian hey I'm not here to name names or allude to any specific person of any specific gender. My tweets are simply in general
@SenorKelsey @BoviceFoSho @Jcoop_22  bruh we gotta make those fucking shirts
When kyle is bringing back the OG squad nicknames. In 4 weeks gonna be so sad to leave this stuff behind 
@_nataliademitri can we stay separated but still bully the underclassmen....
@SenorKelsey probably gonna eat myself into a coma after I stop playing football bcuz I wont workout...maybe I'll just take metabolism pills
@HaileyValdez1 how bout you @ me next time?
@SenorKelsey reference the following tweet bucko
Okay I'm done taking up your timeline. Don't want to get put into twitter jail for bullying the timeline with my endless remarks
I'd give someone a hug if they made a collage of my best roasts through the years. Might even give them money if it's good enough
Along with the rest of my life
TBH I'm just salty that my best days are behind me. I'll never be able to roast the same again. My roasting career peaked in highschool
@SenorKelsey @landonyoung30 <GROWING HEART>
Probably going to get called into the office tomorrow for referencing bullying in my tweets. Maybe I'll pull the fire alarm to get out of it
Isn't "good" a relative term though?
If you are a cop/lawyer/concerned-parent/NHSadmin. I have given up the bully life for good...
Because then technically it's not bullying it's just a school rivalry
Wasn't my lesson suppose to be to not bully though? So maybe we should unite as a school and bully valley
Like we won the COTY competition, we're obvious the elite of the school
All this hate that's been going on between the senior class, can't we just unite and get back to basics and bully the underclassmen
Maybe both
I'll probably get arrested in the future for running a crime syndicate or for fraud
Which is probably a lofty unattainable goal
Trying to get all my bad behavior out of the way this year in high school so I can be a good kid the rest of my life
For clarification my lunch detention had nothing to do with twitter. It was purely to prove I had larger cajones than @ReaganMcCloud1
Really enjoyed my lunch detention today. Am I officially a delinquent now?
Staying up to watch Dual Survival? Good idea
Guys come to Dillons and hang out with me. I promise it'll be worth your time
David just got hella roasted by George
@landonyoung30 the threat of cyber bullying has much control over me. Not worth the hassle. Enoy the time you have under 18
Probably a smart idea to take a step back from the roasting life.
So I can't take my frustrations out on twitter anymore....damn...
2 office slips in 1 day. I'm so popular #sorryguys
He's like a majestic lion in his natural habitat. Pure beauty  
@KadeRemsberg @BurbrinkCasey the snitch that started it all... #ogsnitch
@yungdictator *there
Okay I'm going to bed now. It's way past my bedtime. Yes I have a bedtime because I'm a mature responsible young adult.
@TheCodyStineman @AndersonAvery @ReaganMcCloud1 or used a hockey stick. Worked for @AdamSandler
@ReaganMcCloud1 @AndersonAvery I try to hit the ball as hard as possible first. Then Lazer my putts
@ReaganMcCloud1 save me some?........pls
@_celina13 any time. I'm here to educate
@KadeRemsberg bed is the best. Everyone should check it out when there at his house. Is room is <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE> 
@thejerodfox @landonyoung30 I try to bring joy to everyones lives in some way every day

Calling @SenorKelsey small Fat Bastard gets the funniest reactions
*Reads this statistic to kyle and evan*
Evan- Good!
Kyle- Awesome
...
Suffice to say Kelseys are twisted 
@evankels got caught in the girls bathroom peeping today. Freaking peepin tom. You make me sick
@SenorKelsey we'll discuss the alliance of our nations on the morrow brother
Note that I do own blades and a sword to potentially use as props
Many of these speeches will be about insignificant things and blow them up to be huge things that call for death of one or many individuals
It goes without saying I'll probably be rambling off some poetic, empowering, legendary speeches in the days to come
Watching the 300 sequel today has me wishing I lived in the days of swords and shields so I could give some badass speeches
It's suppose to be a fun week and I feel like shit
@ReggieMillerTNT winning time is maybe the best 30 for 30. Top 3 for sure
Snitches get stitches
#weknow
When your family's been sick all week and you catch the tail end of it. Thanks guys
@acheray7 it's truly a sad life you live
You know you've hit the epitome of bored when you've resorted to popping bubble wrap online
@NolanBrill33 square up tomorrow. Watch me knock you out bruh
@teamtkelso your gods not real. There's only 1 true god
@NolanBrill33 I would have gone and dragged you out of your house and buried your live body with those dead hoes
@NolanBrill33 yall should've got buried last night. If I was the 12 I would've rolled into there bustin caps in asses
Like my mom's watching the blind side in the front room but I'm too tired so I'm probably gonna go to bed #turnup
It's been such an awful day. I don't think I could have worse luck than I did today. At this point I'm just glad tomorrow's a gold day
@ellllbelllll I can't handle him when he's snoring. I'd rather have him awake pissing me off
@Cval175 @RondaRousey bruh best believe I'll assume the fetal position real quick
When you had a bad feeling about something and you were right. Always trust your gut guys
Ronda Rousey is an awful actor also. Definetly shouldn't quit her day job. Don't tell her I said that though
Fast and Furious 7 ending was so sad. Hit me right in the feels guys
RIP my Newton bros
"@KCCauldron: Spotted an hour before the game.

*Proceeds to put little brother on the front porch and lock the door*
Actually looking forward to work today. Idk who I am anymore...
When you forget to turn off your school alarm &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
@ConnorrG15 we'll squad up tomorrow
I tweeted that Drubers tweet from my comfy bed. I had no intention of getting up
@Thomas_Casey123 how long is that flight from Florida?
Who's looking to go to Drubers?
We built this Schmidty. We built this Schmidty on tootsie roooooolls
@TheAlexRickard I don't have a history of enjoying time at Braums so it was a nice change of pace
It's been a good night. Time to finish it with some New Girl #judgeme
@ReaganMcCloud1 biggest fan base he's ever had
@NHSNewtonian <FROG FACE><HOT BEVERAGE> 
@ReaganMcCloud1 ik he hollered at me. I was hella getting in the pitchers head
@ReaganMcCloud1 were you guys enjoying my heckling?
Shout out to the baseball team today. Good games today. I brought the student section to centennial for @ReaganMcCloud1
Kelso just grabbed the wheel as kyle was driving and we swurved all over the road. I'm pretty sure we went on 2 wheels. No shotgun for Kelso
@nahrens22 strikes again 
@Maisenburg deal
@kshsfessions @teamtkelso @SenorKelsey @wyattburbs_3 @CameronsCastle the fuel for 1 of my meanest roasts ever. I still feel bad to this day
"@RelatesAll: relationship goals 
@Maisenburg I'll give you 2 dollars for a batch
Thanks to Noah and Kyle I will be singing that verse of America Pie for a week or two. May I add it'll be sang poorly too
The day the music died.....I started singing bye-bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
I always forget to turn my volume up before watching snapchat videos
@accool72956 no one escapes the Umscheid wrath
Like why will my wifi randomly turn on when I'm in the middle of nowhere but I have to turn it on manually at home? #gettingtrolled
@Cval175 I hate you
@BraedonMorrison ik but I figure if I can do her hard shit then the exam will be a breeze
@BraedonMorrison the struggle is so real man. Part of me wants to give in and the other part wants to avoid the Umscheid wrath
"@m10_oller: I wish I could do something right" @somethingright
Tbh the best part about the AP Calc study seshes is listening to Umscheid roast the students who aren't there
Probably gonna wear my new panda shirt once a week for the foreseeable future
Wish I could go to the soccer game today but Umscheid is ruining my life
@TigerWoods good luck in the @TheMasters I know you'll do a good job and win buddy! #letsgo #greenjackettime
Like I'm going to bed. I sleep on the main floor so if that tornado strikes.......I always hated all of you, yes especially you reading this
@emily_grace15 I'm gonna miss giving you that sass. I'm just trying to undeviantify you
Motherfuckers in Newton talking shit on this tornado. Yall better knock on wood because if a tornado hits and you survive I'm gonna kill you
@emily_grace15 that's 3 weeks too many
@Young_Swagg59 you better knock on wood motherfucker
Kyle and Noah singing today reminded of this scene of Tommy Boy, good movie recommend checking it out 
The fact that my 2nd snapchat of kyle and noah posted without sound makes me so sad because their singing was so angelic
I hope NHS loses power so that they have to cancel school #knockonwood #fingerscrossed
Mr Preston pranked called Noah(not kyle like I accidentally tweeted earlier) while we were in Wichita today. He hella fell for it
Senior skip day? More like Señor skip day. @SenorKelsey is a champion
Mr Preston- "Hi is Kevin there?"
Noah- "Kevin? Kevin who?"
Colton- "I tried the Baja blast once and didn't really like it"
Kyle- "What'd you fucking say?"
Already ready to skip
Today is the day I've been waiting 4 years for
I hope a tornado touches down in the Dillons parking lot. Like not bad enough to destroy alot. Just enough so I dont have to work for awhile
So senior skip day goes from April 8th to April 11th right? I'm not too sure on the rules here, can someone clarify?

Sometimes I feel like people don't like kyle and me, but then I realize we're too funny to be disliked

I probably won't roast or be a dbag (any more than normal) because that takes a lot of energy that frankly I don't have anymore
@snappinglong that doesn't count. I'm talking about spiritual, human being superiority
Along with the increase of roasts, I'll probably be resuming a douchebag approach to life
@snappinglong jk I don't pray. That's for people that think there's a superior being. I'm the most superior being I know
Someone told me I was different on twitter last night. I can't have people thinking I'm a good person so I'm amping up the roasts again
@snappinglong I prefer to pray at home
@bdowney33 tell him you pulled your *makes a ♢ with hands*
@snappinglong don't tell me how to live my life, Mr Krabs
Definitely just failed an AP Calc test
The key to a good picture is to have a long hashtag. Many people think the key is many or none, but they're stupid. It's one long hashtag

I dislike wsu because they have had a good team the past couple years so they can challenge ku so the kstate fans I hate cheer for them
@SenorKelsey it's people like you that give "wsu fans" a bad name
Is there a player on KU I would trade for WSU? No. This team just needs time to develop, I'm ready for next season. Hopefully we keep cliff
@SenorKelsey not true in the slightest
@SenorKelsey how are wsu and TCU comparitive?
Fulmer exposed Jonah
@joshfulmer83 @JonahBrackeen @MalikMckinney98 #exposedhim
Real talk WSU wasn't a 7 seed though. More like two 2 seeds going to battle today
@SenorKelsey #11straight #youlosttoTCU
When Vanvleet elbowed perry we lost control of the game. WSU won because they cheated. This game should be void and ku handed the title
@Phog_Fanatics don't forget graham and perry
Remember when Kstate had basketball fans
@SenorKelsey oh I forgot you're a wsu fan in March
KU loses and the kstate fans come out of the woodworks
@SenorKelsey I didn't think kstate fans were allowed to talk right now
Remember when KU beat WSU by 49? I miss those days.
When was the last time you saw a KU team lose 9 games in a season? #wellbeback
To all the fans saying "what about the championships" please stop and give this wsu team some respect. The better program isn't in question
Because there's nothing I hate more than Kentucky
When wsu plays Kentucky I'll be rooting for wsu
The problem with a wsu ku series is will wsu continue to have this talent? I'd love to see an actual good instate rivalry
Wait till football
@Cval175 best team this year yeah
KU is going to be so good next year
Props to a good experienced WSU team. Love to see a yearly game and give another Kansas team a chance to rise in the ranks
Lane made me hate WSU fans
@LanePauls I wasn't salty before this tweet
"@J_Fettke: Plot twist: Tyler Self sparks a comeback and hits the game winner" #Ibelieve
WSU exposed a young team tonight
@Adoughty88 @thejerodfox he has a lot of heart and deceptive speed
Fuck you rim
KU and WSU should bring back the yearly series.
#Ibelieve
Let it fly
I take it back. I want mason graham Oubre Greene and Ellis
@SenorKelsey @LanePauls stahp
I love Selden but please bench him Self. I want mason graham Oubre perry and lucas
Need defense to comeback
KU is deciding too late that they want it
Graham wants it
I think Oubre saw my tweet. Good effort
@ReaganMcCloud1 you pride yourself in being a grammar nazi?
@ReaganMcCloud1 I can't be held responsible for spelling when I'm angry tweeting
Like it'd be one thing if they were playing D and not scoring points but they aren't playing D
Remember when KU use to have players named Kelly Oubre and Wayne Selden? #dissapeared
Good news is Graham is gonna be raw af next year
WSU can't miss
With that said I still believe
WSU currently showing what heart and experience can do
At what point do we just start hurling 3s and praying? This isn't the team I felt confident in
Kelly just got hella outhustled there. WSU just wants it more
The bad thing is this a veteran wsu game they're not gonna lose composure and blow this game. KU has to battle
Remember when WSU couldn't hit a 3 Friday? I miss that
#BushDidKuvsWsu
Okay Oubre needing one of those 20 point games
Seems like we've made more of those toss up after the whistle shots than actual shots
Please go man Bill
Shit KU if you can't play for pride or tradition play for mason
You can't play zone on a shooting team
#getthatand1
#freemyniggakelly
From now on all my tweets will be in the form of hashtags
#Ibelieve
"@landonkade13: Connor Frankcamp watching the game like 
Idk how I feel about that charge
That should of been an and 1
I though KU left this shitty play in the regular season. Obviously I was wrong. Come on boys
Fuck me.
I hope self is ripping KUs ass right now
Both teams playing opposite of Saturday. WSU hitting their jumpers and KU is bricking theirs
Working the post and wsu is picking up fouls. Keep going to it
"@KUHoops: First to double digits on either side. #kubball 
Absolutely stupid pass
Mason and Perry can't do everything. We need Wayne or Kelly to get involved
Okay here we go. Come on boys
Shit Cliff would be eating today if he was eligible. Ifs won't win the game though...I say we put in our white boys (Svi and Mickelson)
"@mchalmers15: I kno KU better not lose this game. That's all Imma say" #bringbackmario
Agreeing with Barkley that we need to work the post better
@ebrown278 maybe
@Cval175 ain't even worried #InSelfWeTrust
Is it just me or was that the quickest half ever
Not a good way to end. Make some adjustments Bill #InSelfWeTrust
Let's tie it before half boys
13-2 run? Are you kidding me guys. Let's battle
We need Mason to do something and for our bigs to play big. Come on hawks
Hey Baker can we go back to 1 of 13 from the field?

#wearethephog CC @bfenci 
Perry's (aka jesus) is back in
Getting hella sloppy
#hurrybackperry
Call than flagrant on Vanvleet. Elbowing Ellis in the face, must of joined the Kobra Kai
@BurbrinkCasey I don't blame you
@BurbrinkCasey sorry not sorry
Terrible possession
Can I go to prom with Mason?
Wsu does a good job hedging. Knocks KUs offense out of sync
WSU shoots fts too well for the refs to be against KU today. Must be looking to up their bracket
That was clean as all hell. Wsu doesn't need any help
These refs are full of shit.
@SenorKelsey @acheray7 @rowell_hanna I'd decommit if Vanvleet said yeah
Enough with the 3s. Work the inside
#putwesselonperry
@JoshCarlgren except you man
I still like wsu and their fans better than kstate
Favorite for Witchita St
@acheray7 no
"@MKelsoTX: My brother just smashed my head in the refrigerator door.." at least it wasn't a staple
@acheray7 *cough* KU *cough*

@KassidyT97 ku
This game today feels like it should be happening in the sweet 16 or elite 8. A good team is going home today. Let it be WSU #RCJKU

@SenorKelsey @NolanBrill33 and fat af
Kyle and I probably shouldn't be allowed to be on twitter at the same time tbh
@NolanBrill33 because you are wise and all knowing
@SenorKelsey @m10_oller @teamtkelso Mano. Some kyle

@SenorKelsey or are you making a life out of your mockery?

@RegierLauren @thejerodfox he employs smoke and mirrors to make him appear to be 3 people. It's actually more of a magic show than a concert
@RegierLauren @thejerodfox actually it's Joe in a wig. They're all the same person
@thejerodfox @RegierLauren Joe Jonas was high when he wrote that script

You know you've hit your epitome of laziness when you put cereal in a cup because using a spoon is too much effort
@ellllbelllll they obvious think your important enough to give a raise to (for what ever odd reason), so they won't take it away
