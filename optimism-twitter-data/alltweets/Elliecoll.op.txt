@louisee_barlow Certainly not, you know me Lou, never one to back down from a challenge
@louisee_barlow The banter would have been monumental
@louisee_barlow I'll pay you to buy them and wear them for the whole of our holiday
Uh oh

And I still believe in the need for guitars and drums and desperate poetry
@fionajcollins You're such an excellent role model xx
@fionajcollins Miss you xx
Wow those exit poll results are little bit heartbreaking
Getting to vote felt wicked sick #IVoted
If the Gracchus brothers come up in the exam today, Im running to Amory &amp; kissing Fillipo on his little Italian face, dont think that I wont
This is probably the most under prepared for an exam I've ever felt but Im not panicking? I am at one with my panic. We are equals now.
My mums exam advice: "If you fail, we'll make a weekend out of going back down south for the resits in August" ...
@roz_pringle We're so prepared, its unbelievable how ready we are
My little ancient history student heart appreciates the help here but my exams tomorrow &amp; I think it may be too late 
@fionajcollins Duly noted xxxx
@fionajcollins I am a women made entirely of stress right now
@fionajcollins You're my favourite, love you xxxx
@HannahWhitham1 That's a level of bravery I could only hope to acquire
@HannahWhitham1 This makes me incredibly happy. We're currently all accepting our inevitable failure, so I hope you're all more optimistic
Update: Mania has set in for everyone in DH1. There is a group of guys stood in the doorway collectively humming the Harry Potter theme tune
@roz_pringle Thats now the official hashtag
@roz_pringle Until that ginger boy has left, Im going nowhere my friend. Im nothing if not stubborn
Update: most revisers dropping like flies. Main competition the group in the corner led by aggressive looking ginger boy. More as it happens
Current goals of this revision session: be the last study group left in Devonshire House. Idgaf if we're here till 4am, we're gonna win this
A formal apology to anyone who sees me on my way up to the library later, you'll be looking into the eyes of a girl who's lost all hope
Remember when indie music's biggest issue was if The Drums were saying 'Oh mama' or 'Obama' in Lets Go Surfing. 2010 was a better time.
@danielllegreeen Is this because I wrote a sarcastic reply on the group chat, pls accept my sincerest apologies xoxox
I've not got any revision done in the last half an hour, but I have confirmed that I still know the dance to Saturday Night by Whigfield..
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
@_rainboots Seeing you improved my day by 10,000%
@jessica__grey Apparently not. You're such a sterotype
Exeter uni exam season drinking game: Take a shot for every person in the shop in shorts and flipflops even though its 3 degrees outside
Heard 3 separate people today all singing the same Smiths song &amp; Im slightly concerned Im trapped in some form of music based groundhog day
Being the only tea drinker in my house is so upsetting, because do you know who's always on tea making duty? Me. It's always me. Always.
Age of Ultron was a spiritual experience. I'm so whipped for marvel studios and I don't even mind
That tweet sounded super deep, but it was actually about the fact I spun myself round too fast on my spinny chair and now I'm super dizzy
Do you ever do something and then immediately regret it
Im just drowning in a tidal wave of wicked sick new music at the minute and it makes me so happy
My names blurryface and I care what you think
Returned from my one and only contact hour this term and I just don't feel like it was worth the three thousand pounds that it's cost me
@_rainboots Totally gonna come cuddle
@_rainboots I love you more than anything, when you in tomorrow? I wanna come visit <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
And I can't swim through a river that don't flow, cause I got too much water to fight
Found my old iPod today. Made me wish I could remember details on roman history like I apparently remember lyrics to Jonas Brothers songs...
@JosieHiggins_ You and everyone else Higgins, you and everyone else
@JosieHiggins_ Yet another of my gifts
Found this while sorting through some old boxes. That's right my friends, a gift

@livmaloney_ Happy birthday sweetheart, wish I could come tonight but hope you have a good night, love you loads xox
@CaraghAylett Had me fooled for a solid amount of time. Clearly wasn't on form
@CaraghAylett Do you remember when you told me you could play English Curse on guitar &amp; I was legitimately impressed for like, five minutes
Never in my life have I identified more strongly with a post on the internet 
The amount of times a day I now think to myself "It's fine, first year doesn't count" is getting worryingly high
"Thou shalt not attend an open mic and leave as soon as you've done your shitty little poem or song you self-righteous prick"
@DannySockettDoA You are so welcome
@DannySockettDoA Have you seen @NMELists because this tweet makes me feel like you need to if you haven't already
Mine and Naomi's take on the Ed Miliband situation 
Hello and welcome to "Ellie and Naomi try to purchase Glastonbury tickets even though 50% of that duo is travelling down the M6"
Tried to start two separate convos with mum over the last 24 hours with the phrase "isn't the bass in this song wicked". She ain't having it
A summary of this evening 
Feel like Miliband is staring into my very soul
My cat keeps getting freaked out cause me &amp; my mum are aggressively clapping with every point we agree with. Wild night with the Collins fam
And on the first night we met you said "Well darling, lets make a deal. If anybody ever asks us, lets just tell them that we met in jail"
@_rainboots I miss you more my princess, cannae wait to see you when I'm back <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@_rainboots idgaf if he's been making gains at the gym as of late, I'm fully convinced I could take him in a fight
@_rainboots Who do I have to fight?!
Life tip: Don't listen to songs that you are fully aware make you cry on the tram because you will cry and no-one wants to be that person
Hearing the new @Spector tracks live is going to be a spiritual experience, mark my words
“So many people I know (myself included) are selfish and pre-occupied with the wrong things"
"I'll be in town early to get stuff from record store day" "cant you just get it on amazon?" My mother not really grasping the idea of RSD
It's amazing in case you were wondering. Like, completely incredible. The world is a better place with this mash up in it. Trust.
Could sleep. Instead choosing to stay awake and listen to this weird mash up of Uptown Funk and Get Your Head in The Game?
Killing me that I haven't got a single festival booked. What's even the point in summer if I don't spend 4 days covered in mud in a field
"Nah that's defo Ellie's phone cause the wallpaper is some junked up indie boy" Things that actually just got said out loud, wow.
Suggesting my friends the best in indie rock for them to indulge in. Where's my award for services to the community at?
Had a shit day at work so mum bought me records to cheer me up. My mum is better than your mum.
Saw some women in Starbucks with both headphones in, just fake nodding at her child as they rambled on to her. Ruthless parenting.
Do you feel like a man, cause you got blood on your hand
@_rainboots Probably my favourite work story ever, an iconic moment. I miss you too princess
Stresses me out when people on Masterchef cook things for the first time while on the show. You're on Masterchef, why do this to yourself?!
As if I just fainted in front of a customer at work so they've sent me home, probably because Im too much of an embarrassment to have around
Why have I chosen to wear black jeans, black top &amp; a fucking bodywarmer on one of the nicest days in ages. Why am I a moron? Judging myself
Woke up emotional cause Tyler got his wife to be in the video for this beautiful song about her and Im just, yeah. So lovely. #TearInMyHeart
Wanna go to bed so bad but I'm powering through to see whatever it is Twenty One Pilots are announcing. I'm so whipped for this band
Can't believe I've spent 30 quid and was home before ten. I've literally mugged myself off, this is incredible
"Why aren't you coming out. Only the weak aren't coming out" - @CharCollinson96
Annoys me so much when you wake up just as your dream is about to get really good
I impulse bought a poncho this morning. Fully believe this is my best impulse purchase ever.
I need to get up and get ready but I've found a very cosy and warm spot on the floor of Chars flat and feel like a very content cat, so no.
Sophie is not a model guys 
The amount of shit in Rosie's car rn feels like we're going on a mini break to Europe, not going out and staying at Chars for one night...
"Don't you hate it when you have so many notes in your purse that they all get stuck in the zip" - Maz Burleigh, 2015 #baller
Dear the girl next to me on the tram who is picking her split ends and dropping them in my general direction: can u not
Another night on mars
Realising my leg had gone dead roughly 3 seconds before I needed to get off the tram was a fairly stressful addition to my Wednesday morning
Don't get people who refuse to listen to music outside of one certain genre. So much good stuff out there, broaden your musical horizons
@kershx Feel so spoilt
@kershx I'm in bed and in pyjamas. The summit doesn't need me in this state. Give ya gal an hour
Love coming upstairs to find my cat has pulled all my clothes out of my wardrobe for no reason. Get a cat they said. It'll be fun they said.
Just hit midnight. Its happening. *heavy breathing* #AmericanCandy @themaine 
New Vaccines single. The Maine releasing American Candy at midnight. Can my favourite bands all just chill out for five seconds please.
@HarryWhittaker1 Tell me about it, actually so upsetting <PENSIVE FACE> (Also, jealous you went to that AM gig)
@jessica__grey You and everyone else Jess, you and everyone else
@jessica__grey You're completely right, god I'm such an inspiration
Whether or not I should spend 38 quid on Vaccines tickets for Wednesday is the biggest decision I've had to make this year so far
Been home less than 8 hours and my parents are already abandoning me to go to a fundraiser of all things. Thanks guys, love you too.
If you're above the age of seven and decide to wear baby blue eyeshadow, I cannot take you seriously and will never take you seriously again
I am, however, enjoying the wild ride that is getting twenty minutes with each cities YikYak feed
Trying to get through all the stops in Bristol on the Exeter to Manchester train is like waiting to get past all the Oldham stops on the met
Love making playlists in advance of long journeys so I can sleep easy knowing my journeys soundtrack will be sick as frick

Current mood; ready to go home but 100% completely not ready to pack to go home
@kershx Yes now, I love a quiz I do
Estimate 20% of the shampoo intended for my hair during that shower ended up in my eyes, so that's how my morning is. Happy Friday everyone.
@kershx Dammmm I'm back in costa del Oldham then <PENSIVE FACE> I'm making a stunning return on Saturday my love!
Why is my last lecture of first year a 9am? Why does Fillipo think he can be this way?
@kershx  When you in Bristol?! If I'm in Exe you can come visit
A solid representation of our house that Matt just walked in, threw custard creams in the groups general direction, said nothing and left
@Tails_ Looking out for you as always <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Tails_ No they're fairly horrible, I'm sure you'll be fine...
Gonna take a lot for a film to have a better soundtrack than Guardians of the Galaxy
End of term is now characterised by me being scared of all the packing I'm going to have to do and also me surviving solely on tomato soup
Just split 3/4 of a cup of coffee over my bed &amp; dont have laundry money rn, so my bed will now smell of coffee forever. Ah uni.
God only knows what I'd be without you
Dying moments of a dire 2 hour lecture &amp; our lecturer goes "Just a note, none of this will be on the exam". Never been so furious in my life
@ambertorr Happy birthday petal! Have a lovely day xx
Walking outside for the fire alarm &amp; seeing James clutching an 8 pack of beer to his chest, cause you gotta save whats most important to you
Just watched the sky get light while listening to tallest man on earth and Im very content with life rn, I suggest you all try this sometime
LISTEN TO IRON MAIDEN, BABY, WITH ME

Justin is the biggest fucking nerd and I love it 

if you don’t like the joke I just made then you can log …
English Graffiti up for pre order and this is the most poor I've ever been, why does life curse me this way
"We dont see much moshing at our shows cause I play piano and no-one looks at a piano and thinks 'Ah! Cant wait to hit someone next to me'"
Letting me have control of the soundtrack for pre drinks is the best choice my house have made all year
@danielllegreeen You're welcome for that gem
@fionajcollins @carefulcolly1 Such a joker Stephen
We're currently discussing making a "quick trip to the beach before dinner". Fucking love living on the south coast <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️

Update on last nights Pingu themed yakking 
Some top quality late night yakking going on this evening it would seem... 
Three separate people told me I looked weird today cause I was wearing blue jeans instead of black jeans. Low key emo problems.
Rumour has it that Twenty One Pilots new single comes out next week. Rumours confirmed that I'm not emotionally ready yet.
#americancandy 

Downstairs at work stocking up by myself &amp; out of nowhere one of the bears sounds starts playing. This is some next level horror movie shit.
Tescos only had weetabix in packs of 24 which is way more than I wanted or needed but bought it anyway cause I'm such a slave to capitalism
Only a matter of time till one of my housemates catches me very passionately dancing to Two Doors Down by Mystery Jets while I'm washing up
10 minutes late for my meeting with the director of education. Is there a more me thing youve heard in your life cause personally I think no
Indie boys are neurotic, makes my eyes bleed
Well, the new Tame Impala song is proper good aint it?
The amount of stuff I wanna pick up from the Record Store Day list is ridiculous. Im too broke for the releases to be so good this year
Rang my mum 3 hours ago. She said she'd ring me straight back but still nothing. I'm being mugged off my by own mother. This is rock bottom.
I just started an essay a week and a half before it's due in. Is this what being in control of your life actually feels like?

@jessica__grey ... Harsh but fair
Universally accepted amongst my friends that they need to add half an hour onto whatever time I say I'll be somewhere cause Im late always
And you're cold and I burn, I guess I'll never learn cause I stay another hour or two
One of my yaks just got over 100 up votes and this is the most hilarious I've felt in my life ever. This is my peak.
My issue is not that Ive woken up with a cut across my nose. My issue is that I bet how I got it is a cracking story but I can't remember it
There will never be a time when In Too Deep by Sum 41 will not be my jam. Forever a tune
It's all meaningless now, as it was meaningless then, all the miserable girls, all the sad young men
@fionajcollins Where did you find this picture of me?
@fionajcollins Well it only just came through, thats not my problem Fi! but just the one, I only had one left, what a sad day xx

Yeah, but, the live version of Handsome from that maida vale session is honestly so on point, god I've missed the vaccines
@_rainboots No shame my friend, Im having my own little dance party
@_rainboots Im not even listening to good 90s now, for example, Im currently listening to Ricky Martin...
Listening to the best of the 90s tonight and I honestly feel about 8 years old and its amazing
@livmaloney_ Best shout I made today ngl
All my friends are proper overachievers &amp; have all finished their essays &amp; Im in bed eating a croissant and havent even thought about it yet
@BexBermingham1 It was a pretty special day, not gonna lie
The love of my life making a return to busking across the street from work has made this shift so much more bearable
The pure childlike joy on everyones face when Fin runs in the room and goes "GUYS. JAMES HAS LEFT HIS ROOM OPEN AND HE'S NOT THERE"
@Mazz_x At Sophie's house before tokes over christmas, proper gets me, we both look so concerned
Happy birthday @Mazz_x Hope you have a proper lovely day, miss you loads <FACE THROWING A KISS><WRAPPED PRESENT><BALLOON> All the love x 
I dont mind you hanging out, and talking in your sleep
I'm cold as balls but if I whack the heating on I'll get warm and sleepy and not do my essay. The struggle is real.
@para_nat ~Super spooky vibes~
Some say my manners aint the best, some of my friends have been in a whole lotta trouble, some say im no better than the rest
Writing an essay is difficult when you're 500 words in but you're still not exactly sure what point you're trying to argue..
Id probably sell a non-vital organ in exchange for being able to go out tonight instead of writing this wank stain of an essay
I feel this yak on a spiritual level 
But tell your mama and papa, sometimes good guys don't wear white
@Mazz_x It'll be a cute day trip
@Mazz_x LIES
@Mazz_x Lies. I refuse to believe this. Idgaf what medical professionals say

She was into the stones when I was into the roses
This is my favourite response I've ever seen to the Blue Album vs Pinkerton debate 
Just found three quid at the bottom of my laundry basket and its like the universe is rewarding me for deciding to be less of a slob
I put more effort into making my essay writing playlists than I put into the actual essay
@para_nat I'm currently in the mindset that I'll just do the reading as I go? Which I realise may be a mistake but HEY HO
@para_nat I dont even know what Im writing Nat, this is horrible
Its only just 10 o'clock and let me tell you friends, I am regretting the decision to not go out immeasurably
Zoned out in my lecture and then my lecturer says "you may be occupying a purely spirit world".. Clearly missed more than I thought
I just go around in circles that revolve around you
Of course Frank Turner is playing in Manchester not even 12 hours before I get back home next month, but I'll still be in Exeter. Of course.
Genuinely thought it was Sunday cause Im actually sat doing work. Let that be an insight into how the only work I do is Sunday panic work.
@BexBermingham1 I needed that reassurance because I'm getting concerned
Never believe Ive lost my Manc accent until I talk to people from Manchester on the phone &amp; then I realise what a RAH Ive become. So ashamed
Felt fine all day &amp; then as soon as Im home from work and wanna go out, I suddenly feel like death? Like wow, thanks life, you sadistic fuck
Get so much joy out of having my break near the end of my shift. I have all of 30 minutes left when I go back out and that's what I live for
@Mazz_x Ahaha mate, my bad, I replied in my head but apparently not in real life.. But I know right, it's super grim isn't it. Poverty life.
Why is studentcom failing me while I'm trying to catch up on Broadchurch. Like, this is almost certainly not the time studentcom
The fact that Fin is sending me pictures of sloths at twenty to five in the morning is just conformation of why we're friends
I laugh when people at Exeter refer to Mosaic as a "sweaty club" cause its unlikely they've experienced the fresh hell of a Factory thursday
Been at uni 6 months &amp; still nobody in my flat has bought a bottle opener &amp; I'm wondering how we're still surviving in this kind of poverty
"I don't wish to remind you how complicated our lives are, but they are arnt they?" My lecturer getting too deep for a 5pm class on a Monday
@jessica__grey love you
If you wanted to know how my lecture is going 
Forgot how much I love The XX
I finished work 10 minutes ago but I'm just sitting on the staff room floor because I no longer care enough about life to remove myself
Given ourselves v limited predrinking time so I just drank a glass of wine in the shower. Dont even try and tell me I'm not living the dream
I can be such a persistent, whiny little bitch when I want to go out but nobody else does...
The Vaccines seem to be playing more or less every festival in summer so I'll see them no matter which one I go to &amp; Im all about that life
First thing I do when I wake up is work out at what point in the day I'll be able to take my nap...
@JosieHiggins_ "Hot sand plains" robin taught you well child...
@JosieHiggins_ Basically jesus
As if Dead Kennedys are playing in Manchester the day after my birthday, honestly buzzing
"Oh wow, sitting up is not a good idea right now" Smitha representing the views of the entire flat this morning...
I have the most fucking amazing friends
Just confirmed that you can fit an entire bottle of wine in the huge cup I got from Build a Bear and Im really happy with this discovery
Shoutout to the guy I saw walking along Prince of Wales road shirtless even though it's five degrees out...
Can already tell today is not gonna be my day
Working my way through the entirety of Biffy's discography is obviously the best way to spend this 6 hour journey back to Exeter
Wish I had a couple more days at home, been so nice being back <PENSIVE FACE>
I dont give a fuck what your product is, if you try and sell it via a 15 second youtube advert that I cant skip, I wont buy it on principle
The world has been super nice to me today, so many good vibes
I have been home for roughly 12 minutes but that is more than enough to remember how much I hate getting on the met
@CaraghAylett My coach says Belfast on the front so I remain unconvinced
My coach home is only making a stop in Manchester and I'm very concerned I'm going to fall asleep accidentally and wake up in Belfast..
Cant even describe how much I fucking hate packing
Teaching my southern housemates what the word "cruckle" means has been my biggest contribution to my house since I came to uni
Need a tshirt saying "If you hassle me, I will put your name at the bottom of my election form, I swear to god" for my trip to campus later
Super excited to see some of the girls this weekend <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Harsh but fair @smitha_manoj 
Well he said smoke whatever you've got left, its getting late and we don't have much to lose
If you need me today, I'll be in bed listening to #EnglishGirls on an endless repeat
All this new music from my favourite bands is making me so happy
I estimate that roughly 92% of all phone calls I have start with the other person saying "Im sorry I'm ringing, I know you hate phone calls"
Favourite game to play during elections week is "try and make it up Forum hill without someone coming to harass you to vote for their mate"
@_rainboots So much love <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
Thirty minutes in and this is an early contender for worst lecture of the year...

@_rainboots Im cheerleading you
@kershx @rosiekeppie Casually inviting myself, but Leeds for at least a day is a massive shout gals
@_rainboots Im excited
Day 6 of listening to All The Sad Young Men on a constant repeat. I feel qualified now to say its 100% Spector's best song to date.
The opening sentence of this essay is hands down the worst opening sentence I've ever written and Im pretty sure its only going to get worse
The look of surprise the guy at the shop has when I walk in wearing normal clothes &amp; not some form of pyjamas is actually slightly worrying
@fionajcollins "Pet owners problems" a.k.a - Us and Rory 
Smitha accidentally shrank her clothes in the wash and it literally looks like her top is made for five year olds and I'm fucking crying
@rosiekeppie I miss you more! You home next weekend? I'm back so if you're home we can sort something! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️xxxx
@rosiekeppie Happy birthday sweetheart! Have a lovely day <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>

@FraserYou It's a proper vacs day today <OK HAND SIGN>
Cause you talk to me and it comes off the wall. You talk to me and it goes over my head
Majorly weird that it's two years today since we went to Sweden. Miss that beautiful country and it's super unsafe laser quest arenas...
I mean, I haven't done my essay, but I've discovered I really quite like foreign hip hop, so Im still calling tonight a success
I'm not really sure how I ended up here but I'm listening to some really good french hip hop on youtube and I'm actually very into it...
@_rainboots I really wanna watch Scott Pilgrim now
@_rainboots "YOU WERE SAYING"
@_rainboots @71Flynn "Scott, are you waiting for the package you just ordered" "...Maybe"
@_rainboots @71Flynn Im gonna sit by the door and wait
@_rainboots @71Flynn Direct me to the "buy it now" button because you have sold me my friend
@_rainboots @71Flynn I wanna be a part of whatever package this is
@_rainboots thought I had, but most of our conversations happen while 1 of us is working &amp; the other procrastinating so its hard to remember
@_rainboots Have I ever told you that I met them? Cause I met them one time
@FitchyPie Not with your standard of chat it wasn't... x
@JosieHiggins_ We basically got smuggled out of Ireland...

@CaraghAylett Thank you, thank you <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@CaraghAylett That's why their poker society is so big, its so full of secrets
Saw a guy on the way home from work who looked like the human embodiment of a Wes Anderson film &amp; its made me believe in love at first sight
I do not get paid enough considering the sheer amount of glitter I am currently covered in...
The me who thought going to sleep at 5:30am was a good idea was also the me who forgot about the Wednesday morning 10am fire alarm test...
Music is the most important thing in my life
Oh my god. Oh my lord. That is my favourite @Spector song they've ever done. I'm already so in love with it wow. I want it on repeat forever
Absolutely going to be late to meet everyone cause Ive prioritised being able to listen to the new @Spector track live above everything else
@CharCollinson96 Its a very weird city, the peacock is the least of our worries
@CharCollinson96 He knows Im terrified of him. He thrives off it, I just know it
@CharCollinson96 to peck me whenever i see him. I think he can smell my fear.
@CharCollinson96 There is a demonic peacock that lives around my block and he leaves everyone else alone but he follows me about and tries
I just wanted a red bull and some bread, I was not looking to be harassed by wildlife on my Tuesday morning
Just took me 10 minutes to walk to the shop and back because I kept getting harassed by the fucking Northfield peacock....
Use the sleeves of my sweater, lets have an adventure
@_rainboots I love you more <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Ring into work and Eloisa goes "there's a northern person on the phone" because apparently thats my only defining trait @_rainboots
Sometimes think I don't even have a fucking immune system cause I get sick roughly every four days
I could be in the worst mood ever and then I listen to You Make My Dreams Come True and I feel alright again. Its happiness in a song.
@kershx @sophieshepherdx This is honestly the greatest news, Im so happy right now
@sophieshepherdx From the 11th, I'll text you pumpkin

"Then I met Josh. A kid with no plan B. He lived and breathed plan A; music. And I liked that he beat the crap out of his instrument"
@CaraghAylett You are so welcome my friend. So welcome
@CaraghAylett I realise the grammar in that tweet was appalling. Im very tired.
@CaraghAylett I always forget we we're internet friends before we we're real life friends. Like, how is that a thing
@CaraghAylett You know how it is Cags. I love you.
My ipods out of battery so honestly like what is the point rn
I've fully accepted I'm just gonna be lowkey emo for the rest of my life

Big love to the guy across from me at lunch who saw me spill sour cream on my jeans but pretended not to notice
The Forum and all of campus is the quietest I've ever seen it, but can I get a seat in DH1? Can I fuck. Exeter issues.
I'm wearing all black and the different shades of black all match and it's made me feel like everything's right with the world today
Obsessively check my uni email the second I wake up incase I've been blessed with a "your 9am lecture is cancelled" email. I live in hope.

Shoutout to the girl sat in silent study who just shouted "OH FUCK OFF JIM" at her mate and then slowly realised everyone was staring at her

The Vaccines are touring in March. The Vaccines. March. I feel like a kid at Christmas.
Too ill to fall asleep, but also too ill to actually be productive instead. Ace.
Listening to the new Vacs track for the first time was a spiritual experience.
Seeing some guy getting bollocked by the Italian bloke who works at the coffee stand in the forum has made my day. Never seen anger like it.

Someone needs to stop me listening to the new Fall Out Boy song before I overplay it for myself cause its all Ive listened to for three days

Have I actually just spilt coffee all over my revision notes the night before my exam?! Im a good person, what have I done to deserve this?!
Biffy are demoing this month. The Vaccs are back playing shows and new album in May. The Maine's new album in spring. It's good to be me rn.

@Mazz_x Yeah to that policeman and then you didn't remember what he said after about five minutes, it was honestly hilarious <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Highlight of the annual family game of articulate was Grandma shouting: "ITS NOT SATAN?! HOW CAN IT NOT BE SATAN?!"
"Me and your grandad like George Ezra""oh me too!""well, I bet we liked him first" ... Didn't know my gran was a hipster but alright
Listening to my new Biffy vinyl and my mum goes "I like this song. Is this Biffy? Wow" She never likes Biff. Truly a Christmas miracle.
My new record player also plays cassettes and my dad is fully buzzing and we're listening to old The Jam tapes. Collins family Christmas.
He also sent it to me via email. 2014 is truly the time to be alive.
Got my xmas card from my grandad and its just a picture of him staring wistfully at a lake and if that doesnt sum up my family idk what will
I've watched Polar Express every year since it came out and I still cry everytime at that song when Billy doesn't get any presents
Life tip: under no circumstances go to M&amp;S at midday on Christmas Eve unless you're a fan of fighting middle class people for party food.

I think we underestimated how mammoth a task cooking christmas dinner for 14 people is...
As someone who just went to the laundry room at midnight, let me assure you; there are some right maniacs in laundry at midnight
Marathoning the whole of Lord of the Rings when I have a lecture at 9 probably isn't the best shout, and yet, here we are..
@FitchyPie my bread pun game is severely lacking. I'm disappointed in myself.

There is very little I wouldn't do to be able to relive seeing Green Day headline Leeds because it was one of the best nights of my life.
"I just love them all, normal penguins, abstract penguins"    What the fuck has this conversation become

I don't think there is any way I could be more in love with the new @thiscentury tune, it's absolutely gorgeous
My biggest question right now is how is there people who hate the new Taylor Swift album because every song I've heard off it has been a jam
Halloween dress up at work. Forgot to take my face paint off &amp; a kid in Boots goes "MUM, WHY DOES THAT WEIRD LADY LOOK LIKE A CAT." Fab.
Seen roughly 9 people on campus in pyjamas this morning and one guy not wearing shoes. Mid reading week lectures have broken us all.
Never let me in Lush when all the Christmas stuff is out because it is my weakness and I will buy everything

Today I saw a man in his late 70s gliding about the city on a child sized scooter and if that doesn't sum up the West Country, idk what will
Making a house meal and my role in the cooking process has been demoted to "Stirrer" because my housemates know I can't cook for shit
The new headphones I bought are so fucking loud that I can physically hear myself getting tinnitus everytime I have my music on
In the waiting room at the doctors. The radio is playing Take On Me. We all want to sing but we know we can't. The tension is real.
I just found out I actually can touch my nose with my tongue and I feel like my whole life has been leading up to this momentous occasion
Doing laundry is literally becoming the bane of my life.

Emailed my Gran two days ago to say hi and she just hasn't replied at all. Getting mugged off by my own grandmother from 250 miles away.
That video of the guy lying on the floor surrounded by lots of happy baby pugs is the ultimate life goal that I'm aiming for
My current main motivation to get my work done is finishing notes so I can then have a celebratory nap.
The fact I need to walk from the flat to Newman in the rain is not exactly persuading me to get out of bed for this roman history lecture <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Got the George Ezra album on full blast this morning to try and take the edge off the fact I've hardly slept and have uni till 1 today

I tried really really hard not to love the new Taylor Swift song but I'm so in love with it I'm considering going to Vegas to marry it...
Just accidentally did a @AlexClegg1 and read someone's newspaper on the tram over their shoulder...
American Idiot is one of those albums that never gets old no matter how much you listen to it

Wishing I was at Leeds so much right now. I just love festivals more than anything, couldn't want to be there more
Looking at home wear is my favourite thing &amp; I don't even have a house to decorate. God forbid me actually owning a house, I'll lose my mind
Been on hold with various different people for an hour trying to sort my life out. Being an adult is frustrating. 0/10, would not recommend.

@lizziesimo I'm sorry <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> Someone else tweeted and it made me look! Hope they're kind to you <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@Mazz_x Same pal <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Mazz_x History is pretty headache inducing but psych is *okay* .. ish
Why did I look at the grade boundaries. Why why why. I am an idiot. Why.
I just really need tickets for the Infinity Land night. My favourite album from my favourite band. Neeeeeeeed.
Gutted I missed presale. I'd sell my first-born to have Barrowlands tickets. Gonna fight to the death on Friday morning to get them <FLEXED BICEPS>
So happy I read the rota wrong and I've come in at 12 for my shift that starts at 2....
@louisee_barlow Ahahaha, it's calling me!
@louisee_barlow Ahahaha, as if! Tell 'em they're a month early!! Have a good time, try not to miss me too much <FACE THROWING A KISS>
In the 24 hours since I watched Guardians of the Galaxy, I've literally been listening to Hooked on a Feeling on a constant repeat.
Guardians of the Galaxy was fucking incredible. Groot is the cutest character ever. Marvel films make me so happy.
Tram just jolted and meant that I twatted my head against the window. I'm pretending it didn't hurt but I'm worried I have a concussion.
Today is a Green Day kind of day
Googled it. It's 17quid to go to the aquarium. I no longer want to go to the aquarium.
My brain just said "theres an aquarium at Trafford Centre. You could go there before work" &amp; now I really REALLY want to go to the aquarium
Severely overestimated how long my errands were going to take this morning and as a result I'm 3hours early for work. This was not the plan.
Not sure why it's taken me this long to watch Sharknado but my life has been changed by this terrible film
Do you really 13 year old Ellie? How absolutely wonderful for you 
@Tails_ IRON. MAN.
@AdamWalton1015 Don't push this Walton
@Tails_ Iron man. Always iron man.
@AdamWalton1015 don't make people feel special if they are, in fact, not special to you
@AdamWalton1015 That's not the point and you know it! Go back to bed, you have a moody holiday hangover
Just watched the guy sat in front of me on the tram send a snapchat saying "hey cutie, missed you <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>" to 8 different contacts. Wow.
There's a couple breaking up in the middle of market street. Literally all of the tram stop is watching them. Most entertaining moment today
The physics behind my cat, who is less than a foot tall, being able to jump on top of my 8ft wardrobe with no problems will always baffle me
This time last week I was watching Biffy from the barrier at TITP and now I'm just sat in bed listening to them and that makes me v sad
When your pet comes &amp; lies down on you &amp; then falls asleep &amp; you then feel morally obligated to stay completely still in case you wake them
I love my gran with all my heart but all her texts sound like she's never been angrier at me in her life 
Hate getting public transport in my work uniform cause people then think I wear beige chinos with white trainers for fun and that's not okay
Saw some fucking incredible sets this weekend, couldn't have been better @Tinthepark #byebyebalado
My grandma is very enthusiastic in her insistence that I enjoy prom 
Everyone else up early to start prom prep and I'm currently sat at the vets with my cat who literally will not stop meowing #livingthedream
I wanted to get up at 7:00 but accidentally forgot to set my alarm last night. Just woke up naturally at 6:59. Today is gonna be a good day.
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep, but I can't, but I can't when you all have guns for hands
I always get to the point when packing to go away where I just think "Fuck it. Im done. If I forget it, I'll find a way to live without it"
I keep forgetting that prom is tomorrow. I keep thinking "what am I doing tomorrow" and then after a second "oh shit yeah prom"
No body. No you can't get sick. You have to spend this weekend sleeping in a Scottish field. You cannot get sick. Don't fuck with me body.
I like seeing people with headphones on and trying to guess what kind of music they're listening to. It's my own personal little game.
I live in constant fear of accidentally liking someone's 8 week old photo when I'm having a casual stalk through their Instagram
"You've seen the films kiddo. It ain't over till it's over"  "Okay, let's do it. Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love"
People who wont watch Love Actually throughout the year because they think it's a "Christmas film" are weak &amp; not people I want to befriend
This time next week I'll probably still be watching Arctic Monkeys and I could scream I'm that excited
Seriously tho, I think one of the requirements of becoming a driver of the X50 is "drives like they're trying to win Mario Cart"
It's 8 o'clock and I'm seriously considering going to sleep, I'm absolutely knackered <SLEEPING FACE>
I hate getting my bank statement though the post because all it does is remind me of all the money I don't have
If anyone needs me today, I'm 99% likely to be in bed listening to Iron Sky on repeat for hours
@Mazz_x <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
Hoping beyond hope that Paolo puts Numpty into his set for T because I need to see that song live pronto
I'm literally living for T in the Park. I basically care about nothing else, I just wanna be in Balado now please
I'm literally so happy Biffy are putting Justboy back on the setlists. Hoping and praying they play it at T
Trying to curb the post gig blues after @BiffyClyro by reminding myself it's less than 2 weeks till I see them again at @Tinthepark <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
LOOK HOW FUCKING CLOSE WE WERE AT BIFFY FUCKING CLYRO. BEST GIG EVER, LITERALLY EVER. HOLY FUCK 
If I could inject the new Courteeners song into my veins and live off it as a life-source, I 100% would because holy fuck I love that song
@JosieHiggins_ Mate, I'm gonna be so buzzing when you see me on Friday, literally gonna cry with joy
Still can't believe I'm going to Ireland this weekend to see Biffy, I'm so so lucky its ridiculous <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Theres a moth on my ceiling &amp; Ive never seen my cat look so distressed in all his life. Hes just walking in circles, meowing in pure sadness
Having one of those days when you want to listen to every song that comes on shuffle and don't skip any and listen to your whole library <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
I don't know why I expect @ethhholl to be on time for anything anymore, I think I should have learnt by now

@louisee_barlow That was ridiculously fast! Thank you poppet! Can't wait for our lunch date on Saturday! x
@jessicapottsx for real, my neighbour works for Sky and his new van is GOT themed. It's got Joffery on the back and Tyrion on the other side
My neighbours new work van now means I have an enormous picture of Jon Snow staring at me through the living room window, which is nice
For reals, if you're letting your relationship with your boyfriend come between yourself and your mum, then you're being a wanker #mic
I feel really ill. My current plan to feel not so ill is staying in bed and marathoning Orange is the New Black. I suggest this to anyone.
"It'll be fun. Patriotic fun" - @Charlotte15155 's best attempt to get me at the pub
They just said cunt on the telly before 9oclock. Is there not a law against that? How utterly unexpected
Lush bath bombs make your skin smell so good, it's actually ridiculous
My number one talent is falling over on packed trams and then watching as the whole tram silently laughs at me
Might try &amp; get some tomorrow. Do they even still sell them? Will it be awkward asking the shop assistant? Updates as and when they happen.
I miss those glow in the dark stars you used to have on your ceiling as a kid. I did not appreciate them as much as I could have.
Such a good night watching @Cirque performing! #dralion is an absolute spectacle of a show, couldn't have been any better <OK HAND SIGN>
@clayt_charlotte Happy birthday beaut, have a lovely day <FACE THROWING A KISS> xx
That three hour nap was an absolute treat. Liking this whole not having anymore exams thing <PARTY POPPER>
Coming home from one exam and going straight back into revising for another is so soul draining. Id ideally like a three day nap break first
The sense of community in the exam when everyone looked at the Research Methods section and collectively thought "what the fuck"
Constant battle between needing sleep and needing to revise
@louisee_barlow Im the second best person at doing India Fishers voice. Second only to India Fisher <SMIRKING FACE>
Given up trying to learn psychologists names and am now thinking of inventive ways to say "A study was done by someone who's name I forgot"
Iron Sky is such a fantastic song. Paolo can do no wrong in my eyes.
The revision playlist has to be either very soft, mellow music to chill me out or loud, fast dance music to motivate me. No in-betweens.
All I'm saying is that if Addiction wasn't short answer, I'd be curled up in a ball crying by now. The only good decision from AQA psych.
Writing with a new pen that hasn't been worn in and is all scratchy and hard to write with is one of the most distressing feelings I know
Say what you want about Lucy Watson but the girl talks a lot of sense most of the time
I just caught a fly in my hand. First try and everything. Now, I'm not saying I'm turning into Spiderman, but....
Just checked. I cannot hear parklife from my bedroom and what a blessing that is.
This proves my theory. Sing Les Mis. Get to final. Sing Les Mis again. Win BGT. Easy peasy.
We've got champagne taste, but not enough money for the real thing. We've got flames in our veins, and just enough money for the weekend.
Just got the weekly shop. Think my mum has seriously overestimated the amount of potatoes we, a 3 person family, will consume within a week
@alixsephton Sorry!! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> but thank youuu <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@alixsephton Ahhh, Im going to Ireland to see them, it's my 18th birthday present! Sorry if I got your hopes up!! :(((
The fact I'm seeing Biffy three weeks today makes me ridiculously excited. That gig is literally the only thing keeping me going rn
My aggressive caffeine intake during revision isn't even a choice anymore, it's a necessity
Mum just rang me &amp; in the sternest voice she could muster told me I owe finance a quid. Her tone suggested Id murdered someone not a £1 debt
My parents are watching the England game on different TVs &amp; one is lagging by about 3seconds so I hear everything twice and I dont need this
The amount of space on my bed that my cat thinks he's entitled to is far too much for such a little animal.
@fayebarry3 Happy birthday Faye! Have a super nice day <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<REVOLVING HEARTS> xx
If insomnia comes up tomorrow, my intro: "Insomnia. Habitual sleepiness. Inability to sleep" @ethhholl @AdamWalton1015 @alderson_lauren
@maddie_france Can feel the death glare from here
V happy that @ethhholl has finally managed to book T in the Park. Gonna be so wonderful, actually cannot wait
Spending loads of time revising a section of the course that doesn't come up is the most emotionally distressing thing ever
Cannot wait for tomorrow to be over <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
The fact @lizzieborthwick is wishing sun stroke on herself sums up how well British History revision is going
Assessing how good an exam paper is by how much I swear internally when looking at the questions for the first time
If economy comes up in the history exam tomorrow 
Today is a Tom Odell kind of day
Leave my phone for a couple of hours and return to find this on the group chat. Are you kidding me. I'm done. 
@lizzieborthwick Happy birthday poppet, hope you have a lovely day <FACE THROWING A KISS><BALLOON>xx
Had a dream that school forced me to take my Lit exam even though I kept screaming that Id dropped it. I am the poster child for exam stress
@AlexClegg1 He would be perfect, Rory was born for the stage
@AdamWalton1015 well, 1. No I didn't but 2. You make a valid point
Cat update: the group of them now congregate when I get back to the hotel at night. I think I've unwittingly started a feline street gang...
@joanne_unsworth Ahaha, he eats like someone will steal it from him! Xx
Having the British history exam and then PSYA3 within 24 hours of each other is going to be the death of me.
"Asquith, what a political penis" - Maz Burleigh, 2014. @Mazz_x
@kershx Yes Kersh! Need to get ours tickets soon, fully cannot wait!!
Of course, the week that I'm out of the country and cant get to a newsagents, Biffy are interviewed in, not one, but two music mags. Great.
@joanne_unsworth Hello! How's the little one doing? Hope he's being well behaved! Love you xxxx
Why is the internet telling me to essentially hang upside down to get the water out of my ear. I'm not a fruit bat internet, I can't do that
I have about half a pools worth of water trapped in my ear and I've never been in so much discomfort in my life, lord almighty.
Just walked back from town and a gang of roughly 7 cats followed me home. Felt like the pied piper. It was glorious.
@joanne_unsworth What a cutie! Is everything okay with him? Is he behaving himself? Hope you're having a lovely bank holiday! Xx
It's dead sunny and I've made friends with the hotel cat. Day one of holiday successful thus far.
I just tried to type 'helpful'. Accidentally wrote 'elpful' and iPhone autocorrected to 'sloths'.. In what world is elpful similar to sloths
Being a fan of @themaine is so good. Constantly putting out new music and it's always quality as well! The new song makes my heart happy <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Peters constant desire to reform everything and just turn the whole of Russia tits up is really quite annoying right now..
Today's revision playlist is Now! 65 to 70. I'm relieving the best of 2006-2009 pop and, let me tell you, it is the best
Wish I'd tried a little harder in year 12 so I could have just focused on my year 13 exams and not have to fuck around with re-sits
I must watch that "You are nothing, you are a fool" vine at least 30 times a day and it makes me laugh every-time without fail
All this chatter about my birthday plans is making me incredibly excited. Only one more month <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PARTY POPPER>
@AlexClegg1 Literally my favourite thing ever, so fucking funny
@jessicapottsx That's such a nasty question! Hope it went well tho <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jessicapottsx What was the 12m? Everyone seems to be angry about it!
I like to search AQA on twitter once or twice a day during exam time, just to see angry reaction tweets after people have finished an exam
Constantly feeling guilty for revising one subject and not doing others, even though I know I cannot physically revise three things at once.
@louisee_barlow Oh please, you're most excited about spending a week with me, don't lie!! <SMIRKING FACE>
My auntie is the best, getting me tickets for Cirque Du Soleil for my birthday. Super excited <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><TWO HEARTS>
I like to listen to my music incredibly loudly while revising. That way my neighbours can't hear the sound of me crying about exams.
An open letter to AQA: if I give you twenty pounds and smile at you a lot, can we all pretend that I get an A on PSYA3 and be done with it?
I was feeling kinda sleepy so I put double my usual amount of coffee in my drink and now I feel like I could fight a bear and win.
Flights all booked for Ireland. The fact everything's finally all booked makes me so happy, only 40 days to wait now <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
When your phones been on ridiculously low battery for ages and hasn't died and you get weirdly proud of it like "you go, you little trooper"
Want to go out tonight so badly. Exams are killing me slowly <PENSIVE FACE>
@AdamWalton1015 @AlexClegg1 @Charlie_smith95 @FraserYou Unless we put Reservoir Dogs on that list, I'm not coming...
"What Did You Expect From The Vaccines" was an album made for days like today
Well I don't wanna wake up in the morning, but I've got to face the day. That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say.
All I want is the weather to be this nice for T in the Park <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I have no time for people who don't know each and every word to "S-Club Party". Those people are no friends of mine.
@maddie_france Thank you lovely! So so happy! <FACE THROWING A KISS> x x x
The whole of my drama class getting a Band 1 grade. 8 of us on full marks. Literally could not be better. Fully buzzing <HONEYBEE>
@maddie_france She was getting very excited about politics before. And feminism.... And monkeys.
WHY IS NETWORK RAIL FUCKING WITH ME. I JUST WANT TO BE IN BED FOR FUCKS SAKE.
The train is literally sat one stop away from where we want to get off. WHAT IS HAPPENING AT 11:20 THAT IS STOPPING A TRAIN.
Why does the train keep stopping. Why am I not home yet. When can I go to bed.
Genuinely feels like I've not had any time to myself for months. Always seem to have about a million things to do at the minute <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Fargo gets better and better every week. Literally so good <OK HAND SIGN>
Love it when you're at a gig and the band stops singing for a line and you can hear the whole crowd properly going for it. Always the best.
@Mazz_x You know how it is
FUCK ME GUESS WHO WON OMFG! TICKETS AT MCBUSTED 
@bettyweasley I've literally never been prouder of you
My dad and his friends determination to go to the pub despite the ever worsening biblical rainstorm is truly inspiring #PrideofBritain
That special handwriting you do on the first page of a new notepad even though you know it'll look like a 4year olds writing in 2 pages time
I've been waiting 10 years to see Busted play their songs live again, tonight cannot come quick enough, so so excited <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<PARTY POPPER>
So excited to go to sleep, this week has fully taken it out of me
Thought I'd love doing Sleep and Bio Rhythms at A2, but now every time I think about it, I want to slam my head on a desk repeatedly.
I wish support notes could be like "I have done some theatre. Please give me good marks, I really need to pass this unit"
Rory has no time for games. Rory looks thoughtfully out of the window and contemplates the complexity of life 
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isnt no going back, and its wrong wrong wrong but we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble
My cat is such a vindictive little shit. He just jumped onto my desk, knocked all my revision off, looked me dead in the eye and walked off.
Attempting revision when you don't feel well isn't even worth it. Would like to have a week long nap please.
@alixsephton That's so weird?! Try Livenation or somewhere else because it might be just ticketmaster being funny?!
@alixsephton I got them from ticketmaster without a hitch! I'm sure they'd tweet if there was no tickets though!!
@alixsephton I got tickets on Saturday no bother! And it's not on their twitter?
Alex has done a lot of pensive staring at the Thames shots over the last few episodes
Yes Binky, the best way to get over someone is to mention him in all conversations you have. Every.Single.One. Even if people don't ask.
I didn't know there was a "sorry I cheated on you" present, but apparently there is and it's a Prada bag. Someone should tell Alex #MIC
I think this Venice holiday dinner might be winning the award for "most awkward conversation of the series so far"
Made in Chelsea drinking game: watch the last 3 episodes back and take a shot every time someone calls Alex's cheating the "situation"
My dad is currently doing that dad thing when he pretends he knows where we're going, when really he has no fucking clue
Also, who is setting off fireworks at 20 past 12. In May. Who?
I think someone's setting off fireworks near my house and I about had a heart attack the first time it went off so thanks for that
In related news: my cat very nearly bit me on the face this afternoon
Giving your pet a kiss on their head while they are sleeping places an enormous amount of trust in them not to bite you on the face
@joanne_unsworth I thought she was quite on it!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MicaelaJackson Happy birthday poppet, hope you have a lovely day! <FACE THROWING A KISS> xx
Came to meet my mum at the hairdressers and I've been roped into having my hair cut for the first time since I was 13. Unimpressed.
Not sure how I ended up watching this documentary on auditioning for Cirque Du Soleil, but now I kinda wanna audition to be a clown for them
@JONNIFAN ahahahaha, that's so funny omg
Forever wishing I had a brain that just instantly remembered anything I've ever learnt and I wouldn't have to do this revising malark
@AdamWalton1015 a fair shout. *or UKIP
Tbf, if they play Modern Magic Formula I'll probably whack someone over the head with excitement... It'll probably be @JosieHiggins_
Watching footage from Biffy playing King Tuts last night is making me so fucking excited for June. Actually cannot wait to see them again <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@Mazz_x I'll defo check it out!
For real, if you can vote in May, go and vote for literally ANYONE apart from BNP. Don't let a racist represent you. 
@Mazz_x I would have thought I couldn't because I don't live there, but if I can, I def will!!
@Mazz_x I don't think I've been given the option to! <CRYING FACE>
@Mazz_x Your mum knows how it is <OK HAND SIGN>
Having a new @BiffyClyro song to listen to on my journey home is making me 100 times happier
There comes a time when you've been doing an essay for so long, you just stare at it thinking "fair play essay, you have defeated me"
Properly loving Fargo. I think it might take a couple more episodes to get used to Freeman's accent still, but thus far, the shows a winner.
So weird helping my mum to write a personal statement. V proud of her for going doing her masters degree though <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><TWO HEARTS>
@alderson_lauren Slightly offended by how many people are agreeing Ahaha <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@AlexClegg1 Literally nothing has changed. 6 year old me knew what was up
Found 6year old Ellies report: "Ellie is beautifully behaved and becomes upset if others are not as well behaved as her" Bossy. I was bossy.
I say again: you want to do well on BGT? Sing Les Mis and jobs a good'un
@chownlee V proud of you! Told you that you'd have smashed it!! Well done Chlo xxxxx
@livmaloney_  Happy birthday beaut, Love you loads!<BALLOON><PARTY POPPER><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> xxx
Love a bit of Ben Marwood while I'm revising
Nearly forgot Made in Chelsea is on tonight! That's cheered me up loads <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>

I say as I attempt to hold my cat like a baby
The fact my grandma now sends me emojis on her emails to me is ridiculous. My grandma is 74.
I dont know if someones using a hedge trimmer outside my house or if, in fact, a giant wasp has somehow got in. Im panicking none the less.
You'd be hard pressed to find something I care less about than Theatre Studies supporting notes.
I think I kinda fancy this Rob bloke. His hair looks so soft
Proudlock's face while watching Stevie read poetry is my face 90% of the time
There is very few things I love more in this life than well thought out and well produced mash-ups of songs.
@kershx I can't do Thursday/Friday day, but nights possibly! Text me when you're free an we'll sort it <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@kershx ooo, I'm free tonight, tomorrow and Wednesday night if any of those work?
@kershx Cutie! I miss you too, we'll make plans soon yeah?
Can the people who are sorting out the Coachella livestream please stop putting my favourite bands on because I need some sleep, thank you.
Wanna make it on BGT? Sing a song from Les Mis and you're sailing
Today I held an owl and bought skittles vodka. Successful Saturday <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Revising Research Methods makes me so angry. I'm never going to need to know how to write a consent form. This was not what I signed up for.
@AdamWalton1015 @fatherwhitehall I disappoint myself
@AdamWalton1015 I like the new one more, sorryy
Forgotten how good a film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is, absolutely phenomenal
@louisee_barlow Cutie you! V v excited to see you, much to catch up on!!
Reading through old conversations is so so interesting
That Binky/Alex/Louise/Spencer meal had some of the most intense 'this is awkward' faces I've ever seen...
New series of #MIC was def needed, cheers me up so much <OK HAND SIGN>
@rosiekeppie AS IF. AS FUCKING IF
Some days require multiple cups of tea. Today is one of those days.
I keep letting the cat out, but as soon as I do it starts to rain and he cries until I let him back in. We need a cat flap. I'm so stressed.
@louisee_barlow Ahaha, very true! Your faces were so funny <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> x
@louisee_barlow Thanks for calling into see me.... <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> How weird is my job <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> x
I'm gonna go for a nap and don't want to be woken up until @Spector have released their new album, please and thank you.
Okay, we could do this the sensible way, but talking's not our forte. So we sing, we sing a beautiful song, getting the words all wrong.
Just stood up &amp; instantly fell over. I didnt trip over anything. I didnt stand up funny. I just fell over my own existence. This is my life.
@joanne_unsworth Taped! Thank you for telling me <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@alderson_lauren Just making myself prepared! Better use them if they're there :')
@alderson_lauren Ahaha, I had too many open! Oooo they're okay though, kinda hope she just gives us that paper!!
@alderson_lauren Oooo wait I was lying, I have dutchess and the black comedy question?
@AlexClegg1 AQA past papers man, they are wonderful things
@alderson_lauren I hope so! I quite like the Lussurioso question so hopefully
@alderson_lauren @ethhholl @AdamWalton1015 @Charlie_smith95 @AlexClegg1 the RT questions for that paper are Lussurioso &amp; Vindice/Gratiana
@alderson_lauren @ethhholl @AdamWalton1015 @Charlie_smith95 @AlexClegg1 Friends, the scene we did today is on one of the past papers..
Today's morning playlist consists of All Time Low, We The Kings and You Me At Six. I feel about 13 again and it's the best.
Waking up to the delightful sounds of the window-cleaner and his portable radio playing Shania Twain this morning was a weird one..
-John 5
Never understand when people don't like listening to the rain when they go to sleep, I love it so much, chills me out loads <UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️<SLEEPING FACE>
Discovering a new band and instantly liking all their songs is the best <OK HAND SIGN>
Just had to google a list of British prime ministers and when they were in power. History A-Level at it's finest.
V excited to write "Disraeli basically ignores the needs of Ireland during his government" in my history mock and then skip ahead 7 years.
Had a minor breakdown cause I couldnt remember what year the land war finished. I am the poster child for why we dont need mocks right now.
Forever having to sign cards to my grandma with 'Eleanor' or 'EJ' because she refuses to acknowledge any other name for me
Congratulations to everyone finally able to marry the person they love today, such a huge step in the right direction!  #equalmarriage
@sophieshepherdx HE WON A PENNY SOPH. A PENNY. And he bought the new special box and it halved his money so he got HALF A PENNY
I asked my dad what time he'd be home and he said 6:03. He came in dead on 6:03 and I'm 99.9% sure he waited outside just to make this joke
Always forget I'm seeing Biffy in a couple of months and remembering always cheers me up so much. Couldn't be more excited
I'm the queen of having weird dreams, they're all insane and it's the best
Confirming my choices on UCAS felt pretty good
The new Eagles In Drag tracks are so so good, wow. @8123
@Molionides So true, but fate is a cruel mistress
Slowly but surely coming to the realisation that I have forgotten almost everything to do with schizophrenia
Your pets coming to sit with you of their own free will is the ultimate sign of love.
There's also a 2 minute solo in which I slowly but forcefully bash my head against a table.
I've written a song about how much money I'll owe the government after university. It's ten minutes of me saying "no" repeatedly.
In related news, I'm listening to We The Kings for the first time in about 4 years and I'm a little bit in love with them again...
Listening to bands you used to be really really into and then forgot how much you liked them is so nice.
Walked the 30second walk from work to the bus &amp; look like I've been stood in the rain for 5 hours. Who the fuck does the sky think he is.
Everything in the world becomes 10x times funnier when you're on a quiet tram and laughing really loudly will cause strangers to judge you
Really in the mood to watch The Darjeeling Limited but I also want to go to sleep. Problems.
You know you're in too deep with a band when you know every single one of their b-sides and have multiple live versions of every song...
Don't talk to me about how Fingers and Toes didn't make it onto Opposites, because I'm still very emotional about it.
@lizzieborthwick Cause you can buy a box at the end that either gives you 10,000, doubles your money or halves it and it got halved <POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE>
@AdamWalton1015 @adamscharlotte3 HE WON HALF A PENNY. NOT EVEN A FULL PENNY. IM SO ANGRY
@adamscharlotte3 This is the single most stressful game I've ever seen Jesus Christ
@adamscharlotte3 I just cheered out loud. I'm so stressed about this Char
@adamscharlotte3 Neither would I! He has the power five, not a damn chance I'd deal on that
@adamscharlotte3 35 thousand Char!!! HOW TENSE IS IT
*Saddest tweet ever* LOOK HOW STRESSFUL THIS GAME OF DEAL OR NO DEAL IS FUCKING HELL 
I have no time for people who don't sing with every fibre of their being when In Too Deep by Sum 41 plays. No time at all.
Tape Deck Heart is such an important album. I cannot physically tell enough people that they need that album in their life.
I must have listened to Broken Piano at least 100 times and it still gives me chills. @frankturner has the gift man, I'm telling ya'
My favourite thing at Leeds was when Biff were on and the whole crowd just lost their minds when they played Glitter and Trauma
Having a shift where there was hardly any customers and then being sent home an hour early was so beautiful <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I'd be so rubbish at The Cube and it makes me really sad because I fucking love The Cube
Was trying to ask a bloke in Next where something was, but he kept moving so I kept following him. He 110% thought I was just watching him.
Writing the kind of essay where not even listening to Bowie is putting me in a good mood. I want to go to sleep.
@maddie_france Not being funny, you actually were. It's beautiful and needs publishing
Reread my Y11 leavers book. 5 different people used the phrase #banterdictcumberswag and 2 people wrote me a poem. I recall none of this.
There is currently a fuck off huge spider in the house. Dads away and me and mum are wimps. Currently relying on the cat to sort this out...
I wanted Queens of the Stone Age. I got Queens of the Stone Age. Can't complain with that <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@joanne_unsworth Ahahaha, miss you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Cannot wait to see Grand Budapest Hotel, it looks so so brilliant
I just love how my families solution for two out of three of us being allergic to cats was "get a cat"
Pretty embarrassing when you're on hold with someone and you start singing the 'on hold' song, and then the person says hi and hears you...
@kershx DAMM RIGHT BENI NEXT YEAR
@kershx T AND LEEDS MANNN #perksofnogirlsholiday
@kershx !!! 
Cannot believe how good the T in the Park line up is <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Rorys sat on my knee &amp; I was petting him, then got distracted texting and he fucking tapped me as if to say "Erm, excuse me, could you not"
The most disappointing thing about having to finish all this work is that Bridesmaids is on at 9 and I can't watch it.
Can't believe my parents just booked my tickets to see Biffy in Ireland for my 18th. I have tickets. I'm actually going. So fucking happy <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><PARTY POPPER>
@alderson_lauren I'm always on my best behaviour!! But yayy, can't wait to see you <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@alderson_lauren @adamscharlotte3 MAMA LAUREN IS COMING?! WHAT A WONDERFUL NIGHT THIS IS TURING OUT TO BE
@HarryJJConreen Happy birthday hon, hope you have a lovely day <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@louisee_barlow Absolutely love it, thank you so much <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@louisee_barlow Welcome! Just got home from work to see it now, it's so so lovely and the perfect size for where I want to put it...
Actually well excited for tomorrow, haven't had a Saturday off work since I started. Cute shopping trip with mama is defo needed <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Woman just got on the bus with a hamster cage and she keeps talking to it. Officially no longer the weirdo on the bus.
I'm now sat with my shoes off on the bus trying to "dry off my socks". Y'know that one weirdo on every bus. Right now that weirdo is me.
As if that sole of my shoe has split so all the rain has gone in my shoe. My left foot is floating. Feels like I'm back at bloody Leeds fest
@Molionides The knowledge he will never be my husband was one of the other emotionally crippling elements of the film
@Molionides That last five minutes with Tim and his dad emotionally crippled me
Just absolutely balled my eyes out watching About Time. Why did nobody warn me about that emotional roller-coaster of a film?!
I had a new guitar and you had a drum kit, and I knew the chords to Smells Like Teen Spirit
Ski Cross is such a stressful event. I'm going mental and I have absolutely no reason to be. Properly entertaining though
@Mazz_x boooooo
This boy on the tram is eating bananas but he just keeps pulling one after the other out of his bag. He's had at least 6. Cant stop watching
@Mazz_x If you go after 6, you can come visit me
@ErikaRoma26 the worst is when adverts buffer. When adverts buffer, I suffer
Apparently I stuffed bears today for a bloke who used to play for United when they won the treble, but I didn't know him and I felt bad
And I played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano, a sinner amongst saved men, on the banks of the muddy thames.
Actually the cutest thing in the world when kids at my work run up to me and ask my name because they wanna name their bear after me <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@louisee_barlow awww yes love it! Thanks Lou <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@louisee_barlow Thanks princess!! Tell me when you want the money, I'll give it to Fi to give to Kay to give to you <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@louisee_barlow The mixture one sounds cute, I trust you to do something nice for me!!
@louisee_barlow Don't be rude!! But ooo what colours can I have?
@Charlotte15155 Don't brag
@Charlotte15155 I'M IN THE BACK ON MY LUNCH IM BACK IN 15 MINUTES
@louisee_barlow Oiii Lou, how much you want for one of those cute triangle bunting things? They're cute and I want oneeee
As if I've been in work since 10 this morning and I'm still only half way through my shift. I just wanna have a nap.
@shelbypine Happy birthday lovely! Have a wonderful day <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@OldhamFace what are you implying?! (Ha, jks, we all know I'm a mess)
Being in your own bed after a night out is the one <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>

LEAVE THEM NOW. BE…
Don't you ask me if it's love my dear, love don't really mean a thing round here
Writing about how unionism helped develop the Labour party is difficult when you have no fucking clue how unionism helped develop Labour
@Charlotte15155 Not sure, will have to keep our eyes peeled
My dad and his mates just had a group call to confirm they're still going to the pub despite the wind. That's pure British determination.
@Charlotte15155 Yeah! Not a massive fan of it thus far, but wouldn't mind seeing AAR
Work ringing me to cancel my Friday night shift has fully made my day
Trying not to wake up the entire household when getting in this late is always fun...
I have stuff I need to do, but I'm actually just sat here basking in how excellent my new headphones sound
Listening to music through new headphones and realising you forgot what your entire music collection is  actually meant to sound like
Spent the morning costume shopping so I can dress up at Batman next week for work. I fucking love my job
Can it be Sunday now please. Literally all I care about this week is going to see Frank Turner.
People who spend their time uploading new albums in full onto Youtube are everyday heroes and deserve knighthoods
@Howarse You are so welcome, enjoy!
@Howarse 
Discovering a website where you get shown a new cute kitten picture after you've written so many words is considerably improving this essay
ARCTIC FUCKING MONKEYS MAN. YES. GOOD.
@rosiekeppie Pearl Jam would also be wonderful <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Hoping and praying for either Blur or Queens of The Stone Age to be announced as headliners tonight <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Swim Deep were wonderful as ever. The pit that broke out during the cover of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was a particular highlight
Apparently Frank is playing Wisdom Teeth and Wessex Boy on this tour and this makes me very, very happy
These new tram stops through Oldham fully take the piss
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
The #tfios trailer is everything I ever wanted. It comes out on my birthday and I am EXCITED. What perfect casting wow
My mum is spending her Tuesday evening trying to teach our cat to play fetch...
This new "Are You The One?" show is absolutely brutal oh my god
The fact my mum woke me up this morning saying "Ellie, Ellie, it's the cats birthday today oh my god" shows how obsessed with our cat we are
When theres no-one left to fight, boys like him don't shine so bright
That was the rankest shift I've ever done wow. Going to have to sleep from now till tomorrow morning if I stand a chance of recovery.
Just spent my last 8quid on a book. If that doesn't sum me up, I don't know what does.
The looks I get from people when they see I'm wearing my work lanyard, with the scissors just dangling from it, are always wonderful
Waking up from a really nice dream is always the most disappointing thing ever
Dont let yourself watch Star Trek with me cause I will spend the whole time telling you how much I love Chekov. Hes my little Russian prince
@Mazz_x Ruined my little heart that film
Don't know why I put myself through watching Deathly Hallows, always know I'll cry like a little kid
I like to be overly-nice to telephone sales people when they ring because they don't expect it and it always throws them off their stride
You wrote your number on my hand but it came off in the rain
Defiantly going to pass out or something as equally pathetic when I'm giving blood, calling it now.
@Charlotte15155 THANK FUCK. But I'll watch it later on, what a massive sweetie
@chloebasnett The bane of my life, yes! Wanna cryyy
@Charlotte15155 BENEDICT BETTER WIN OR IM FUCKING CALLING SOMEONE TO HAVE A WORD
Trying to remember what happened in Act 3, thought to myself "Im sure someone dies" and then remebered everyone in this fucking play dies
This is the best of the fake underground signs. Dont argue with me on this. 
@ethhholl Do what I can
Theatre Studies support session is a thing that is currently happening
@alderson_lauren What the fuck is casting choices about?!! I don't need this Lauren, what is Sarge playing at, SHE DOESNT EVEN GO HERE
@ethhholl @AlexClegg1 @Charlie_smith95 @AdamWalton1015 @alderson_lauren Thought I'd be nice and help you all out
@ethhholl @AlexClegg1 @Charlie_smith95 @AdamWalton1015 @alderson_lauren Only question I've found for the brothers! 
I would genuinely considering selling a kidney in order for @frankturner to play Pass It Along on the Feb tour
The fact that both the Theatre mock questions are on the same play, so I have to write my intro paragraph out twice, infuriates me.
How I found AS psychology hard I'll never know. Absolute walk in the fucking park compared to A2
@AdamWalton1015 @Charlie_smith95 Same
Always forget how good an album England Keep My Bones is, and then I listen to it again and have that lovely moment of "fuck this is great"
That was a conversation I had with myself while I bought a new phone case. I don't need a new phone case.
Me before I got a job: "How do people who work all the time spend their money though?!" Me now: "Oh... That's how"
Will always pay more to get online orders on express delivery. I have no patience what so ever.
@Beckii_L Thanks Becky!! You da best x
I just laughed for a good minute and a half at the phrase "Alabama arbitration" ... Def need to stop revising and go to sleep
Me before any exam: 
Public service announcement: I've officially given up with life. I'm gonna go to sleep. Don't wake me up until festival season starts.
It's days like these that I regret taking essay based subjects more than anything
Slightly concerned that the house across the street is going through an alien abduction... 
@Mazz_x all hail the blink box woman
@Mazz_x I got BlinkBox and I swear to god Im gonna find the women who voices the Special K advert and have a word cause shes ruining my life
I swear to god, if Queens of the Stone Age get announced as Leeds headliners, I'll fall into a two day joy-induced hibernation.
While I'm not exactly the biggest Mumford&amp;Sons fan, I have no time for people who don't see The Cave for the stunningly beautiful song it is
All of the lights on my street just went out. Hoping this means Dumbledore is gonna show up and tell me I'm actually a wizard...
The utter chaos my house descends into when the cat brings in a mouse is ridiculous. You'd think it was the god damn apocalypse.
I live for albums where the songs fade into each other, it's just the nicest thing ever
Finally booked Swim Deep and Frank Turner off work <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
OOEEOO, I LOOK JUST LIKE BUDDY HOLLY, OHOH, AND YOU'RE MARY TYLER MOORE. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US ANYWAY, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT
My head defiantly been done in today, I've just listened to Buddy Holly by Weezer on repeat 26 times and barely noticed.
In some good news, I've got quite into Band of Skulls today. In less fun news, revision has emotionally broken me. Swings and roundabouts.
Currently on my 6th cup of coffee this afternoon. Revision is sending me under. My entire blood stream will soon be solely caffeine.
Considering just writing "everyone fucks up" as my theatre mock because thats basically the whole plot of The Revengers Tragedy
Ben Howard is perfect revision music
I wonder how much of my life I've wasted watching the first five seconds of any youtube advert while repeatedly clicking the skip button
My new phone downloaded every song I've ever bought on ITunes automatically. All of them. Currently enjoying the best of 2008.
@AdamWalton1015 #khantbetamed (also, well done!)
Talking about Leeds fest always makes me miss it so much, such a good weekend
Literally all I care about right now is Sherlock and listening to Frank Turner's cover of Biffy. Thats it.
I still love Mary, I don't give a fuck, she's the queen
I've never been this ill in my life but Sherlock was that good that I kind of didnt mind for an hour and a half.
I swear to god, if anything bad happens to Mary on tonights episode, I'm going to be so mad because she is the queen of my world
Very real possibility I could fall asleep on the tram. Trying to stay awake by frequently reminding myself how embarrassing it would be.
Every year they announce the Coachella line up, and every year its amazing, and every year I'm sad because I can't go
I love when my cat sits by the radiator for a while and then moves to sit next to me because he's like a little heater and it's the best
I can already tell that today is one of those days where I should have just stayed in bed.
I'm really really tired but The 1975 were absolutely mint last night and I met Matty Healy who was a sweetie so...
Feel like half of fucking Manchester is going to this gig
@MattyBullock11 This is actually very helpful, thank youuu
@maddie_france I'll sing extra loud for you <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

@bettyweasley BETH IM SO SAD ABOUT THS PLEASE BE SAD WITH ME
It was just pointed out to me that Sherlock didn't get to dance at the wedding even though he loves to dance and now I'm sad.
"And what do we say about coincidences?" "The universe is rarely that amazing"
That was such a good episode. So well written. Yes. Good. Very good.
@kershx PLEASE
Oh fuck it, I'm going watching Sherlock.
@kershx Laura I'm writing 3000 words on a topic we arn't studying and have done 0 work on, I want to cry, please run me over with your car
@kershx @sophieshepherdx that tweet was iconic #shop
@sophieshepherdx @kershx #reflective was the greatest day of my life omg Laura how do you not remember
I have very little money in my account and I still bought Opposites: Live from Glasgow because I literally cannot help myself. Jesus.
@louisee_barlow MATE IM WELL UP FOR THIS HOLIDAY. NEXT TOP MODEL ROUND 2
God bless the people at Starbucks who always serve me after work even when they're closed. Someone give them a medal.
The thought of history coursework makes me want to dig a hole in the ground, lie in that hole and literally never get out.
Please do not talk to me about Sherlock Holmes right now, thank you.
@AdamWalton1015 Thats a very fair point..
Why is it always that the Trafford Centre is dead apart from the store I work in??? WHO IS SPENDING THE LAST DAY OF 2013 BUYING BEARS!!!
The holiday purgatory between christmas and new year is the weirdest time ever. What day is it? I dont know. I haven't known for a while now
Anyone who's seen Kasabian live knows that Velociraptor! live is a million times better than the album version.
@CaraghAylett LIKE 2 MONTHS
The fuse in my house has blown so none of my lights are working &amp; every so often you hear a switch flick &amp; then someone go "FOR FUCKS SAKE"
May as well just punch me in the face instead 
When you try to handwrite notes after not writing properly for over a week and your handwriting looks like that of a drunk three year old
Can't believe I've been convinced to go out. Weak. I am so weak.
Tellin' ya, @Mazz_x is such a bad influence on us all
@Mazz_x I know, we're both as bad as each other
I'm sat in bed watching The Cube in my pyjamas and it literally took one text from @Mazz_x to make me consider going out. I have 0 self will
@Mazz_x only just seen this cause of work, but I was so sure you'd know them!! I was like COME ON MAZZY YOU KNOW THIS
@Mazz_x Work Bitch brings people together like nothing else!!
@Mazz_x I was like "WHERE IS MAZ. THIS IS THE OFFICIAL CAR SONG" and then we went for it like never before. Beautiful moment
@Mazz_x My musical knowledge is vast and not to be messed with!!
Minor Threat, Black Flag and Dead Kennedys all within 10 minutes of each other. The @frankturner mix tape on @Xfm is such a winner
That tweet looks strange if you don't know that I work at Build a Bear. Im not just condemning all parents who buy their child a teddy.
I can feel the boxing day sales maniacs mentally preparing themselves. Please, for the love of god, nobody buy your child a bear. Please.
My dad just made a Miley Cyrus joke that he made up himself across the dinner table. Collins family christmas.
My family is my favourite thing in the world. So grateful to have been given such funny, caring, loving people in my life. Love them so much
I already feel how much my parents are regretting buying me a surround sound hi-fi system for my room with a bunch of new CDS..
*Geeky tweet alert* Should have seen my face when I opened this, my parents know me so well! 
Seeing my gran dancing to christmas songs has already made my Christmas. So thankful to have such an amazing family, couldnt be more lucky <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@louisee_barlow Classic Dave moment there
I'm a 17 year old only child, but I'll be fucked if I'm not up early on Christmas morning
@louisee_barlow Huge cutie you Barlow!! Have a lovely christmas beaut! Love you lots and lots Americas Next Top Model
@Tails_ You've been waiting for that chance for a while, haven't you?
@louisee_barlow Yes agreed, fabulous plan!!
@louisee_barlow Your dad was trying to get us to come on holiday with you in May. We can revise all day and get drunk at night. It'll be fab
The lack of @louisee_barlow in my life on a christmas eve doesn't feel right. THIS ISN'T TRADITION GODDAMMIT.
@louisee_barlow I'm very stressed I haven't seen you tonight. Its like the first time in about 10 years. This isn't right Louise.
My dad: "Eleanor, drink some wine or something before you go to bed because if you wake us up early, I swear to god" Nice try dad, nice try
@sophieshepherdx I've had it taped for a week now mate! Sorry to disappoint
Where is my mother? Why isn't she home yet? I WANT TO WATCH POLAR EXPRESS GODDAMMIT.
I need to stop crying at christmas adverts. A three minute advert break is becoming a real problem.
@alderson_lauren It was a beautiful moment
@alderson_lauren "Is that a mince pie?" "MGHHGGHHJAKCNS" ".... Alright Lauren"
When you put the last piece of Sellotape on a present that you're wrapping, and then can't remember if you took the price off or not.. fuck.
@JONNIFAN Happy birthday!!!! Have a mint day, love you lots xxxxx

Everything about The Hobbit is wonderful. God bless Peter Jackson. God bless that entire cast.
Didn't know if I wanted to buy the @Spector 2014 calendar. Then this happened, and now I have my card in my hand 
Being in the living room while the postman walks past my front window and attempts not to make eye contact is always awkward...

He's just said "It's 3, we've know each other for an hour" WHAT. CLEARLY SOME ROM-COM STYLE MEETING HAPPENED AND I NEED TO KNOW HOW.
He's Irish and they're talking about what books they like. They're bonding over Great Expectations. I'm rooting for this relationship.
Oh god, a couple clearly on a first date just sat on the sofa across from me at Costa. He's trying so hard to impress her, it's so cute.
I think you should know, you're his favourite worst nightmare
Work will be busy. The kids will be loud. I'll probably cry half way through stuffing a bear. Yay.

@kershx I miss you more :( but working baba, sorryyyy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@kershx Tweet of the year right there
@Molionides You'd pull off the triple denim no worries Mol!
@kershx I just don't know what to think. My head says no but he looks so confident in himself that I'm like ".... Okay then buddy"
I kid you not, some lad on the tram is wearing triple denim.....
I keep pulling him away and he runs straight back to try again. It's not a challenge Rory. This isn't fucking crystal maze, Jesus.
My cat is currently trying to walk across my christmas fairy lights even though they are shaped like VERY POINTY ICICLES YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT
I always get really stressed when people next to me on trains fall asleep. Do I wake you up so you don't miss your stop or let you sleep IDK
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby, snap out of it
I have to wait half an hour for my train but I have a gingerbread latte so let's assess who's the real winner here Network Rail
Keep stretching and accidentally kicking the American girl sat in front of me on the train &amp; it's only a matter of time till she murders me
@_katestevens PRAISE BE
@_katestevens If this is true Im gonna cry with joy I s2g
From the day our Christmas tree goes up to the day we take it down, I spend 50% of my time saying "Rory, no" because my cat is a little dick
@FraserYou so true
I like being on buses that people are running for and then watching the hope die in their eyes as they see it pull away and know theyve lost
Some 12 year old boy at the tram stop has dropped his starburst and is having an emotional breakdown and it's really making my afternoon
@maddie_france Always think Leeds when I listen to it <CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Had so many rude people in work tonight. You've had to queue for about three minutes, can you not be a giant asshat about it.
@ConRSHep @jessicapottsx I just fucking love cats man
@jessicapottsx @ConRSHep We will co-adopt her. One week at mine, one week at Jess'
@ConRSHep oh my GOD SHES SO CUTE
Literally just seen something I've asked for as a christmas present on the desk in the spare room. My parents aren't even trying anymore.
Whoever says Sam Claflin wasn't right to play Finnick need to reassess their opinions because he was the perfect casting choice okay? Okay.
Praying for my last lesson to be cancelled tomorrow so I can go home at break <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

Just found my cat staring through the hedge at some ginger cat from across the street. This isn't fucking Romeo and Juliet mate, get inside
I'm really emotional right now because Tom Baker and Peter Capaldi and "I don't wanna go" and just wow leave me to cry in the corner.
TOM FUCKING BAKER THO.
To be honest, the apocalypse could happen tonight during Doctor Who and I wouldn't even notice because DOCTOR WHO
@Charlotte15155 it was hilarious aswell...
@Charlotte15155 ahahaha, sorry bud!
Some old man at Co-op couldn't open his car so me and my mum helped him. Felt like Kate Winslet's character in The Holiday
I now fully appreciate what the word "boiling" means after playing four rounds of hide and seek with 6 year olds while dressed as a bunny
@louisee_barlow in the costume?! When I was playing hide and seek? AS IF! THATS WELL FUNNY
When I went to work today, I didn't think I'd have to spend half an hour in a 6ft tall, fabric rabbit costume but....
My grandma just sent me her christmas list and she's asked for the new Kings of Leon album. My grandma is 76.
@Mazz_x @Charlotte15155 @ErikaRoma26 This was us on the way to London... 
@livmaloney_ SO PROUD. WELL DONE, YOU ARE FAB
@AlexClegg1 Close, the opening monologue! I'm still looking quite proudly at it over three minutes later
When you write a cracking point in an essay and then just sit there for a minute and contemplate your own brilliance
@AlexClegg1 I believe you have it written in like that, I just think you're wrong
@AlexClegg1 I just have this overwhelming feeling not to trust you on this.
My dad has what can only be described as a CD full of indie covers of christmas songs playing very loudly. I don't understand.
@JONNIFAN That's well funny omg
I'm still in my pyjamas at midday. This is wonderful. Can all days be red week Wednesdays please?
@FraserYou #fuckyou
@livmaloney_ LOVE YOU

Unless you want to discuss the fact I'm finally getting to see Vampire Weekend live today, then please dont talk to me...
@jessicapottsx RORY AND I SAY HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY PRINCESS. We love you lots and lots, have an amazing day xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They're now showing me pictures of pumpkins and askings who carves a better pumpkin. What the fuck is going on...
They're all drinking Budweiser and Jamie from IT just announced quite loudly that someone is a "gaylord". This is truly hilarious.
Half the male staff of Crompton House on the tram drunk off there heads. Fab.
@alderson_lauren Thank you mama Lauren! Xxx
My cats obsession with sitting on any form of packed bag with a look of "please don't leave" makes any kind of trip emotionally unbearable..
Remember that tour when Frank played Worse Things Happen At Sea and it was basically the best four minutes of my life
@jessicapottsx ITS THE LAUGH AT THE END
@Charlotte15155 @maddie_france I'm laughing so much I had show my mum. My jaw hurts because I was doing that silent kind of laugh omfg
@maddie_france @Charlotte15155 I'm dont know what video you've watched Maddie because i'm sat here crying actual tears of laughter
@jessicapottsx These have improved my evening 110%
@jessicapottsx I've just watched this about 10 times and I'm still laughing omfg. Bless our mutual humour
I come home to dead wildlife on my doorstep far more often than I'd like to. Why does my cat think this is a sweet gift, it fucking isn't...
There are a very limited number of situations in which Come On Eileen is playing and I am not singing like its the last song I'll ever sing
@CaraghAylett I unfortunately was not :(
@CaraghAylett That's such a coincidence! But you were correct lovely
@CaraghAylett yes, that is my stupid face behind Fred
@Charlotte15155 Yeah, as much as I can on it, but theres not much to say!
@Mazz_x i havent, im still on ireland. WE DID ONE FUCKING LESSON ON IRELAND. I AM SO STRESSED.
@Mazz_x i want to cry, i have no structure, it is a word vomit about stuff i dont even understand. please feel awful about this with me.
@Si1994Berry So good, crowd was crazy though, was concerned I was going to perish under bodies... But I've hadn't been before but I loved it
@Si1994Berry I'm quite pleased, even though I look a right spoon! But as if!! I think you've one up'd me there
Can we discuss that Fred and Tom took a selfie on stage last night and my stupid face is in it, like whatttt 
@adamscharlotte3 Happy birthday beaut! Sorry I couldn't come last night, hope you had a mint time xxxxx
@FraserYou too excited, can't cope, will text you when I'm going queuing tomorrow!
@patmaine Favourite Halloween film? #foreverhalloween
@FraserYou .... Go away
@ConRSHep 100% agreed
As long as The 1975 do She Way Out on the January tour, then life's gonna be okay
@FraserYou Why would you not do that?
@FraserYou I have EIWIL playing right now, I might cry I'm that excited
@sophieshepherdx @kershx watching Pete giggle to himself at She's the Man was literally in the top five moments of my life
So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor. There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been here before
@FraserYou I like these daily reminders, they make me very excited
@katieshark @AdamWalton1015 "people brain" amazing description from Katie there
@AdamWalton1015 @katieshark It is rather amusing
@FraserYou Dont make me excited, no barrier means I'll be very close to Tom and I can't deal with that... But that's a very good question
We bought Rory an early Christmas present. He's not best pleased. 
@FraserYou I don't care, we're being barrier one way or another
@FraserYou I AM SO EXCITED I COULD CRY
@FraserYou 7 DAYSSSSSS
@joanne_unsworth Thank you! Love you xxxx
1. This is awesome  
2. This is tricky

@AlexClegg1 You have clearly ruined someones day
We know the fire awaits unbelievers, all of the sinners the same. Girl, you and I will die unbelievers, bound to the tracks of the train
@Charlotte15155 .... Worrisome
Love having tickets for either the first or last night of a tour. Always the best shows <OK HAND SIGN>
Finally booked my ticket for The 1975 <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
Someone needs to stop me listening to Heart Out because it's been on repeat for 3 hours and now all I can hear is that synth beat...
Applying for uni makes me want to put my head in a blender
The fact I have so much work I can't watch #MIC till tomorrow has really ruined my day
Homeland is the highlight of my week
My mum went into Asda to buy batteries 14 minutes ago. Can only assume she's been buried under a mountain of rollback offers
Cute night with all my favourites <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@AdamWalton1015 agreed #lightofmylife
Me and @AdamWalton1015 referring to actors like they're close friends of ours #ourHazza
Attempting to convince my mum that dressing Rory up as "BatCat" for Halloween is a fantastic idea
@AlexClegg1 @FraserYou I personally find the fact everyone dies and Antonio at the end is all "well shit.... guess I'm duke now", hilarious
London Grammar are also perf. Where has all this good new music come from?! Not that I'm complaining.
I have no idea where Lorde has suddenly appeared from, but god-damm that 'Royals' song is so fucking good
I hope that you're folding stars
@AdamWalton1015 #livingthedream
One lesson today and it's practical theatre <OK HAND SIGN>
@sophieshepherdx A collective group emotional meltdown is going to happen, I can feel it
Group chats are weird and stressful...
@AlexClegg1 Don't be sarcastic Alexander, it doesn't suit you
Good opener to the series, but a whole episode with no Damian Lewis was tough to take...
Homeland stresses me out so much. I love it, but serious stress.
Homelandddddd <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@CaraghAylett I don't even mean that, I have big love for democracy, I just do not want to write this essay
Disraeli can take his reform act and shove it up his arse for all the fucks I give about it
@Mazz_x @lizzieborthwick @Charlotte15155 Coursework can suck a dick as far as Im concerned right now
@Charlotte15155 @Mazz_x YOU'RE WELCOME
@Charlotte15155 @Mazz_x That was not a question I thought I'd be asked today. Erm "converted from Judaism to Christianity" ?
@Mazz_x @Charlotte15155 I put a tiny bit of narrative in the introduction but the main is why he did it and the results
@Mazz_x @Charlotte15155 I'm just putting in different opinions and historians views man!!
@Mazz_x @Charlotte15155 @lizzieborthwick I'd say maybe two and a half typed? That what I'm aiming for!
@Mazz_x @Charlotte15155 @lizzieborthwick I'm currently in a cry/write cycle, but it's getting there
Far too excited for #Homeland tonight!
Praying I get the job I've just applied for considering the most beautiful boy I've ever seen in my life took my CV in...

UCAS feels too important to be filling in while sat in bed wearing pyjamas, and yet here I am..
Open the door &amp; my cat runs out from the bench where he's been sheltering. Never seen a "where the fuck have you been" face like it before..
Never understand people who "don't really listen to music". I get genuinely irritated if I haven't listened to music for a whole day...
People saying Queens of the Stone Age are a heavy rumour for Leeds headliners next year is getting me excited <OK HAND SIGN><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
So jealous of everyone in the queue for Fleetwood Mac <PENSIVE FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Menswear is such a massive tune. The 1975's whole album is top notch <OK HAND SIGN>
Wish @AdamWalton1015 would stop thinking he has a chance with @lauradiggle_x s mum!
When suddenly the world stops and you think I'm not around, look down baby, I'm probably in your pocket now
So fucking excited to see @Spector again in November #hurryup
@Jonnaohman How rubbish!!! We want you here :((((

The amount we fawn over Rory when he's been in a fight is ridiculous. He's the most spoilt cat I've ever known.
@rosiekeppie "GUYS. WE'VE PUT AVICII ON SO YOU FEEL AT HOME. COME AND DANCE RIGHT NOW"
@rosiekeppie I feel that feel
That was possible the most emotional twenty minutes of my life. Having to force @rbeccaandersson onto the coach to go home was bants though.
Can't even describe how much I'm gonna miss the swedes #faves #swedelife
As if me and Bec stayed at Courts having a nice chat until now, when we have to be up at half five #gohardorgohome #andwerenotgoinghome
Room full of people singing Ronan Keating.... #swedelife
@AdamWalton1015 they are being, but I know mine, so suck it
Well up for Blackpool today!
@alderson_lauren Happy birthday baba! Sorry I'm off so cant party with you, but have an amazing day and I love you lots xxxxxx
James Charnock: "Guys, can you all be off my turf by eleven"
The noise Alex Maddie and Beth just made when I told them it was half eight was a beautiful thing
Tears aside, Wicked was amazing. The cast was perfect and I am happy.
Hello. My name is Ellie and even though I've seen Wicked more time than I can count, I still cry at Defying Gravity
@louisee_barlow Hey! Mum said to say you know Wicked tickets are £35.50
@Andrew_Weir I agree with that tweet 100%
@Andrew_Weir I lived and breathed the first two seasons. What a glorious show it was
That scene in Being Human when Mitchell &amp; George emotionally breakdown cause Real Hustle isn't on is a defining moment in British television
People who put up full HD sets from festivals on Youtube deserve to be knighted for their services to the world wide community
Although weather or not I'll come back alive due to this apocolypse like monsoon remains to be seen
Gran and Grandad taking me out for Sunday tea because they 'miss me' the absolute cuties <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>

Rory meowing at me till I push the curtain back so he can sit on the windowsill. He's such a diva, it's ridiculous.
Live At The Apollo <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
Can you imagine if some kid acted like that at our school. They'd probably execute them in the hall during assembly as a warning to others.
"Guinness is good for your baby" ARE YOU HAVING A LAUGH WITH ME. YOU ARE 16, ARE YOU HAVING FUCKING LAUGH. WOW.
@fionajcollins Hiiiiii xxx
Been in bed before half ten every night this week so far. Sixth forms taking it out of me, I swear
Why am I watching Biffy's set from R+L? I'm just making myself sad because I'm not still there
One of my favourite pastimes is wearing a thin piece of fabric round my hair line and pretending I'm in MGMT
Rory just came in soaking wet and muddy  and then fell asleep on my bed. He's such a vindictive little fuck. I've raised that cat perfectly.
Everytime I see a picture of Danielle Haim, I get really sad that I'm not Danielle Haim.
@kershx the Collins' love you back just as much
@AlexClegg1 I'd pay good money to see that

Just downloaded Welcome to Night Vale... I'm probably going to regret this
@sophieshepherdx @kershx Only just seen this, but agreed!
I've watched enough interviews with Biffy Clyro over the last three days that I now randomly fall in to a bad scottish accent while talking
@joanne_unsworth Thank you! Xxx
@jessicapottsx Oh my dear sweet lord, that is fucking adorable. Related: look at this happy rat 
At Marco Pierre White's restaurant. The whole room is decorated in pictures of him looking smug. It's wonderful.
I've just remembered everyone singing Bohemian Rhapsody before GD played at Leeds, and I'm 100% sure that was the happiest I've ever been.
@groovymutati0n I have no shame when that song is on. No shame at all.
There are very few times in life during which Air Hostess is playing and I don't belt out the chorus with as much effort as I can muster...
@AlexClegg1 @Molionides @AdamWalton1015 Well that was rude Alexander...
@jessicapottsx @ameswhitehead @MicaelaJackson This was what she said needed doing when I emailed her! 
@jessicapottsx @MicaelaJackson @ameswhitehead I've only done one! Ye issues one? And I saw her today and she didn't say anything?
I just forgot the word for mist and called it 'air frost' and that right there is an indicator of how tired I am this morning.
@Charlotte15155 They're sold out for September, but I wanna go in February!!
@Charlotte15155 Charlotte, it's so good, I can't even talk about how wonderful it is
@Charlotte15155 Ugh, I'm mad about them because they didn't release the album before the festival, and the songs are SO GOOD.
I was bad at finding rooms last year, and they'd stayed the same for the last 5 years up till then, so I'm going to be atrocious this year
Can't wait to be 20 minutes late for every lesson these next couple of weeks, cause I'll have literally no idea where I'm meant to be.
@CaraghAylett Feel my Leeds pain with me. So many bands I didn't appreciate
Forever seeing bands I like, but arnt crazy about, fall in love with them, and then get mad, because I didn't appreciate seeing them enough
@joanne_unsworth Yes! Thank you for the reminder though <FACE THROWING A KISS>
There are at least 2 bees currently in my house, I'm not brave enough to catch them &amp; my dad isn't home for another hour. I'm crumbling here
Refusing to bin last years theatre supporting notes because I'm not going to carelessly abandon the notes I worked solidly on for 3 months
Biffy doing The Captain at Leeds was literally the best thing ever. Thinking about it is making me sad, because it was that good.
My mum is pulling the cat around while he sits in a show box. She's making train noises....
If I don't get a good timetable come Wednesday, I'm kicking off. Its been rubbish for the last 6 years, I deserve this.
Don't even get me started on when company's actually make the pockets and then SEW THEM UP. Why. Why would you do that. Jesus Christ
I can't stand fake pockets on clothes. If you go to the trouble of making it look like it has pockets, then just give me the fucking pockets
Dear god 
At first I was annoyed I lost all my contacts, but now I quite like the mystery element whenever someone new texts me...
Yessssss 
The beautiful famous #daniellegreen whom I adore more than life itself 
Just payed for my Nandos in pennies. If that doesn't sum up Britain's financial situation, I don't know what does.
@AlexClegg1 I dont have the money!!! Besides, if I did, I'd be getting The 1975 tickets
@CaraghAylett Im not! I need a Frank friend
@ethaann24 Yeahhh buddy! Wanna come with?
Why is every band I love announcing tours at the same time. I have no money, stop it, it's not fair.
The thought of how much work I still have to do before we go back to sixth form gives me a headache
This Means War is my favourite girly film. Never stops being funny
@CaraghAylett If you wanna go, I have presale? No worries though if you wanna go white lies
@CaraghAylett Second hand proud mum syndrome
@CaraghAylett M.E.N
@CaraghAylett Idk, it's arena, but Apollo tickets went quick?
@CaraghAylett Well when you decide, if it's Frankie, gimme a shout
@CaraghAylett General sale Friday! Fancy going with me? I need a Frank friend
@louisee_barlow You did so well, I was chuffed for you! But that makes sense, hope you enjoy it! And I did, it was amazing!!x
@louisee_barlow Where'd you decided lovely? Also, well done on your results!! My mama told me while I was at Leeds and I was well proud!
I'm listening to Biffy in a depressive slump. Get me back to Leeds sharpish
Got my Leeds photos developed and they are the funniest things, dear god. My friends are the best <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I'm absolutely ruined after it, but Leeds was the best 5 days of my fucking life. Amazing. @OfficialRandL
@CaraghAylett Idec, I'm finding you Saturday and we're watching Frank together, okay? Okay.
@CaraghAylett Sounds good cutie!!! Excited to see you!
@CaraghAylett Yeah I'll have my gig number, so I'll text you in the morning before I set off, so you know its me
@CaraghAylett Not in anyway, but yessssss, I'll text you when we're camped and come find you?
Seriously though, a good 75% of my favourite stage actors have played Fiyero at least once. Why does everyone get cast in that role, IDGI.
Paul's live version of Town Called Malice from Days of Speed is just perfection.
I like Toby already #GBBO
That baker has the right idea: have a cup of tea and hope for the best #GBBO
Love a bit of #GBBO me
Doing my Leeds shop has made me so excited for tomorrow <WHITE SMILING FACE><PARTY POPPER><OK HAND SIGN>
“@Spector: For those worrying -  we don't clash with Biffy Clyro at Leeds or Reading. x." THANK THE LORD

@Mazz_x @sophieshepherdx Even mine has a camera buddy. It cost me 7:99 so I'm intrigued to see yours
In other news, me and my mum just ordered our second cocktail pitcher of the night. We are the human embodiment of 'go hard or go home'
All these tweets about Leeds are getting me super excited about going!! 3 more sleeps <WHITE SMILING FACE><PARTY POPPER>
Let's all take a moment to appreciate this photo of me and @LukeTreadaway because Luke's face is a gem 
@AdamWalton1015 Yeah, but, did you meet Luke Treadaway tonight? 
Hello. I would like to confirm that @curiouswestend is just as mesmerising second time round. Unbelievable show. Excited for act 2!
Excited to see the wonderful @LukeTreadaway in @curiouswestend tonight for the 2nd time! Sure it'll be just as incredible second time round!
Related: I just spent five minutes talking books with the guy in waterstones, and I'm now in love. My affection is easily won.
My favourite kind of checkout assistant is the checkout assistant who is bored and wants a chat.
Seriously though, @antonzetterholm was born to play Enjolras. I suggest everyone buy tickets, because his performance was flawless.
Anton Zetterholm IS Enjolras. He isn't playing him, he has become him. Amazing preformance.
Interval at Les Mis. One Day More was the most inspiring thing I've ever seen in my life. Enjolras is amazing. LET ME SEE ACT 2.
Mum just saw Trevor McDonald and shes well impressed with herself...
@kershx Just results and stuff, I'm just having a shit day boo
Wow. As if my day wasn't shitty enough as it is. Wonderful. Fucking wonderful.
@oliviawxxx Told you you'd be fine you spoon! Well done, proud of you! Xx
Advice about results that my dad seriously just gave me: "it's the taking part that counts" Actually no dad, somehow, I don't think it is...
I'm making a pre-emptive playlist for tomorrow. It's called "Yes you failed your A-levels, but you're still going to Leeds festival"
Don’t you wanna get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight.
@rocksound excited to be heading back to R&amp;L this year? Have you changed up the setlist for it?  #turnertime
"Why the fuck did I look at the grade boundaries" - my new album coming tomorrow. Featuring the hit single "oh for fucks sake"

@CaraghAylett We'll find each other at Leeds and cry together. And then get drunk. And then cry some more. Normal night for us...
@Becca__ginge Agh, same here. So so nervous! Thank you poppet, good luck to you too! X
@MicaelaJackson @Mazz_x AQA website lovely!
Tweet about how shit my results will be and then get this email. Apple are taking the piss out of me 
If someone wants to come to my house while I sleep tonight and murder me so I never find out my results, be my guest.
@katederek AQA website!
@Mazz_x I've accepted I've failed Psych. Ive emotionally moved on from it
@becky_ashton95 *our exam
@becky_ashton95 I don't know, cause I can't tell if it's outlet exam or yours!!!
@alderson_lauren I *think* it's 66 out of 100 for written, so 33 on each section , but I'm not 100%
@Mazz_x If I'm reading it properly, its 52 out of 72 for an A... <PISTOL>
And even that one I'm not crazy about. Fucking wonderful.
Wow, theatre studies is the only grade boundary that's not making me want to shoot myself, wow ok fab.
Tomorrow 
I either don't listen to Foster the People at all, or I listen to them constantly. There is no in-between with that band.
Everytime some asks me "so, what do you think your results are going to be?" 
Buying something on Amazon that has no customer reviews, so I have no idea of the products quality, is as daring as my life currently gets..
@ErikaRoma26 ... Well that's just improved my Leeds festival experience by 1000%
Get to @ethaann24 's house and he's got the bathroom window open and is singing really loudly in the shower and not letting me in...
National Theatre Live/RSC Live are like my favourite things. Whoever thought of broadcasting stage shows live to cinema is king of my world.
Yes Rory, I really wanted to be woken up this morning with you launching a suprise attack on my face, thank you so much...
@lizziesimo I hope so, he's so interesting as a character! But oooo I'm dead excited now
@lizziesimo I think he'll be in it even more in S3 after David died in the explosion! I hope Quinn is still around, I grew to like him
@lizziesimo To be honest, I'm not even surprised by that, anything can happen on that show!
@lizziesimo when it clicked and everyone just went "NO. NONONONO" Ridiculously good writing. Excited to see where they take it from here
@lizziesimo That was so out of the blue, never saw that coming at all! Such good writing
@lizziesimo they are the masters of cliffhangers between episodes! I get stressed just thinking about it
@lizziesimo This news has significantly improved my friday night, I'm am now VERY excited
@lizziesimo Season 3?!? I really hope this is season 3
This photo of a dog wearing a tea cup like a hat has really brightened my Thursday

@joanne_unsworth Seem to be doing fine to me!
@AdamWalton1015 definitely. The Collins family are wild
As if I'm at the pub with my grandad who's pissed. What a lad
@AlexClegg1 Wouldnt wanna be you half way through geography
@HannahWhitham1 Same! Was so nice to see you!! But definatly sounds a plan x
@Andrew_Weir Do you know you're on display at the coliseum? 
Excited to see @OTWOldham 's #PoliticalWill tonight! Only heard good things so I can't wait!
This drinking game aka: how to get alcohol posioning at a Frank Turner gig 
I get genuinely angry when I think about how good Heroes was in season 1 and how the writers violently killed it. IT HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
I only like moths because watching my cat, who is no taller than half a foot, try and reach a moth on the ceiling is the cutest thing ever.
I'm not even exaggerating when I say that the one week old kittens from next door are the cutest things I've ever seen in my life.
@kathrynwitney Of course I will come!! Will get Josie to come with me!
@kathrynwitney When's it on? I wanna come!!

Do not question my love for @arzE , he is inspirational 
If Vampire Weekend play Diplomat's Son when I see them, I will lose my shit because my love for that song is endless
@sophieshepherdx I have a story about how I knew I was right, I'm going to message it you as proof
@sophieshepherdx Wish you actually knew my twitter... BUT I FUCKING KNEW I WAS RIGHT. bitch.
If you don't listen to L'Homme Run, you are missing out, cause it's possibly the funniest thing ever. Ezra is basically my favourite person.
I probably shouldn't be paid for the last half an hour of work cause all I do is stare at my computer and hope the data will input itself...
Listening to the new Vaccines track for the first time has reminded me why they are my favourite band. Love them so fucking much.
As if they have me answering the phones at work today. Everyone is aware of my fear of phone conversation. There is a real chance I will cry
Actually quite pleased with the weather waking me up cause I have to leave for work in half an hour and was still asleep. Nice one thunder.
BBC is the best to watch during big events during the lull when absolutely nothing is happening because they will literally discuss anything
Just watched a room full of people try and hit the high note of Blurred Lines. Safe to say, nobody hit it.
The fact this is the 7th time @Lewis1995 has put Best Song Ever on in the last two hours...
@lizzieborthwick #grafting

@AdamWalton1015 Are you watching it?!
I'm going through a very intense Vampire Weekend phase. Like, I'm listening to nothing else. I blame their glastonbury set.

Also, I would like to know why my cut is so bad. I fell off a chair for fucks sake. It's a foot tall at most. HOW DID I EVEN CUT MY LEG OPEN
I like how the bruise around my cut has just stayed around the edge in a square like a bruise frame. It's like a gory Picasso.
Why do all the bands I like announce tours in the same five weeks. I do not have the money for this bands I like. I love you but hate you.

As if Attack The Block is on in ten minutes and I need to do these psych notes. I want to watch Treadaway be a posh stoner for fucks sake.
@AdamWalton1015 Behold, me in cat form.
@AlexClegg1 WHAT A CUTIE! He tried so hard on his lap
@AlexClegg1 What's on?!
@AdamWalton1015 No, I'm not getting it till after results!
My motivation to care about the biological therapies of schizophrenia right now is literally nothing.
Ethan ringing me so I can listen to Frank Turner playing at T. What a cutie <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Listening to Foals in this weather is making me very excited for Leeds <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>
As if All American Rejects are on at this party. Feel like I've been transported to 2006
Also booked to see Les Mis on the fucking west-end!! So god-damn excited, gonna be amazing <WHITE SMILING FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE>
Just booked to see @curiouswestend again over summer because it's just that good that I need to see it again!
I went from sitting at my desk to do my sabbatical work to watching Wasteland in under ten minutes. I'm so dedicated, it's unbelievable.
@AdamWalton1015 Love you too
@AdamWalton1015 I'll make sure to tweet frequently about how much fun I'm having
As if Mums agreed to take me to London over the summer to see Curious Incident again and Les Mis on west-end. Eeee, so happy <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@AdamWalton1015 You're too TAF for your own good
@AdamWalton1015 Thank you for your consideration (I assume you understand this reference by the way)
@AdamWalton1015 I feel like this trip could benefit immensely by letting me tag along... pretty please
@AdamWalton1015 No I did not, but this information has improved my night dramatically
All I want in life right now is too see MGMT live. Is that too much to ask? I think not.
I've been laughing at this for twenty minutes. I cant stop laughing. Send help. 
I want the guts and glory baby
@AdamWalton1015 DON'T TAUNT ME LIKE THIS
I just grabbed the first two black shoes I could see in the porch &amp; that meant I nearly left the house wearing 1 brogue and 1 vans. Nearly.
If you don't think Frank Turner is a god-damm poet, you are wrong because that mans lyrics are like no other. He's such a talent.
Sometimes I just watch American Psycho purely because of Christian Bale's performance in it. Literally amazing.
Spending my Tuesday night rediscovering 2006's best pop music. I feel like I'm 10, it's fantastic.
My package was meant to arrive today and it hasn't. Ive never been more furious about anything in my life.
In an attempt to simulate my festival hair, I literally haven't done a thing with it for four days. Lets just say everyone is in for a treat
I just made two cups of coffee and forgot to boil the kettle. It only dawned on me when my mum drank some of hers. I've officially lost it.
@AdamWalton1015 There is very, very few ways it could go wrong.
@AdamWalton1015 Literally the cutest. I ordered a film with him in where he's the lead singer of an indie band so I'm hoping for good things
@AdamWalton1015 I like him in that because he basically just plays himself
@AdamWalton1015 THE INJUSTICE. I'm still in a post-seeing-Luke-act depression. I had to watch Brothers of the Head to cheer myself up
I just want an job so I have the money to see Curious Incident over and over again until it closes because, goddammit it was so bloody good.
You have no idea what fear is until one of your posters randomly falls down, especially if your house has been silent for over an hour.
@Molionides Twin telepathy. Even though we're not twins... Regardless
Gonna watch Brothers of the Head tonight, because why wouldn't you watch Luke and Harry Treadaway as conjoined twins in a punk band?
Fell In Love With A Girl is one of those songs that only sounds the best when you play it so loudly your ears might burst.
Just ate some strawberries regardless of the fact I'm allergic to them, because it's nice weather and I'm feeling reckless
He's now trying to get the other kids to pick the option where you do all the songs in a row and it takes like an hour. He's an evil genius.
One of the kids I'm babysitting just said "No Harriet, we're not playing Just Dance, it's EXHAUSTING" That kid is me in a 7 year old body
@shannoncollx Pippin and sexy Macbeth were also excellent
London review: Luke Treadaway is the love of my life and I am emotional about not getting a picture with Ben Whishaw when I could have.
Such good seats for #curiousincident ! Can't wait to see it!
@James_Ellidge It's on sky living but all the first episodes are on the Internet somewhere or other I think! But you should, it's amazing!
@James_Ellidge Its so so good! Such a clever adaption
@James_Ellidge Both, but also the show on telly at the minute. All three are ace
Goddammit, Hannibal is so clever, unbelievable writing
All packed for London. Excited isn't the word!!
My mum just stepped on what was, at worst, a snail. She's now parading round announcing she's 'stepped on a snake'. Somehow I doubt that Fi.
Just paid for the tram in 5ps. You're welcome network rail.

Someone needs to stop me listening to Balthazar so much, because it's almost becoming a problem
Can I put "does reasonably good impressions of characters from Pixar films" on the skills section of my personal statement or...
@JMCharnock Happy birthday cheeky!x  (for five minutes ago. Ooops)
I could write my personal statement... or I could watch Despicable Me.
THE WILDERNESS MUST BE EXPLORED
I just get water up my nose and have to dry my clothes, in your aftershave ocean
Public transport will be the death of me <POUTING FACE>
All these uni open days are making me want to go to uni right now! Don't wanna wait a whole year yet <PENSIVE FACE>
If I had a quid for every boy in a blazer I've seen today, I'd be a very rich lady. WHY IS EVERYONE WEARING BLAZERS. IT'S A SATURDAY. JESUS.
If I've learnt anything from Nottingham's open day, it's that if you get a move on, you can get across campus in ten minutes flat...
@WilliamLee287 You are so welcome
@maddie_france Good luck cutie, you'll be amazing! <FACE THROWING A KISS><DANCER>
@Lozaaaa_H This is the best hour and a half of my life, I swear to god, it's fantastic
@louisee_barlow Have a good time today cutie! I wanna see pictures!! X
"I-haven't-got-a-ticket" girl is still in hysterics. They're still making her pay 70quid. East Midland Trains have no time for your tears.
It's all kicking off on the 8:45 to Nottingham.
Oh my god, the girl across the isle hasn't bought a ticket so they're charging her 70quid. Shes started crying. CRYING.
"IT WAS A JOKE CATH. LET IT GO" The saga of Jim and Cath.
Oh god, he just tried to put his arm round her and she really loud went "FUCK OFF JIM" I'm having real trouble not laughing here, oh my lord
I've paused my music to listen to them. This is hilarious. Really hope they argue for my entire journey.
Oh god, oh god. The couple across from me on the train are having an argument. This is the best thing that's happened all week.
The lad at Costa giving me a large coffee for the price of a small because I look tried. Today is good already <OK HAND SIGN>
Cause there's this tune I've found that makes me think of you somehow, and I play it on repeat until I fall asleep
She's only 17 and she hasn't met Freddie
The day The Vaccines don't finish their set with Norgaard is not a day I want to live through
All of The Vaccines are in their late twenties but I don't care, they're still my babies.
Watching my babies be amazing at Glasto. So jealous of everyone whose there.
Weather better cheer up for Nottingham tomorrow <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Charlotte and Sophie are happy campers this morning.....
Love finding new music and falling in love with it instantly
Cannot wait to see @Complicite 's #lionboy tomorrow! Been waiting a long time to see a show from these guys!
I need to see Tom Odell live. This is not a want, this is a need.
And although I might like it for one afternoon, I don't wanna live on the moon.
@sophieshepherdx @kershx #myfinestmoment
@kershx @sophieshepherdx Sounds good to me!
Melody Calling is flawless. The Vaccines are flawless. Excuse me while I listen to this song on repeat for 3 weeks.
I'm not being funny, but The Vaccines release a new single on the same day The Maine announce a UK tour. Life is good for me today.
Once I start doing psych work, I actually don't mind doing it at all, it's just the initial 'fuck this' I need to get over
Hannibal is wonderful but I spend the majority of the time I watch it shouting "COME ON WILL. ITS SO CLEARLY HANNIBAL. FUCKS SAKE" at the TV
The ultimate first world problem is when you have a small, internal emotional breakdown because your bus is 15 minutes late...
Listening to music through new headphones when you've been using ones that's are dying for weeks is the best <OK HAND SIGN><HEADPHONE>

@maddie_france You have seen the light! She's my fave, she just doesn't give a fuck and it's fab
Ugh, can't deal with Louise, don't get pissed off with Spencer for a whole series about stuff like this and then do it to Andy.
When I'm older, I really hope I'm like Binky's mum
@Andrew_Weir During exams as well... That's dedication to marathoning a TV show
@Andrew_Weir Are we quelling the Hannibal addiction with this instead?
@Mazz_X I think so! Ask her tomorrow, it's a ball ache to explain, such a long thing <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@Mazz_X That horrific 24 marker for Friday! You missed the lesson when she explained it
My desire to start this psych essay is literally non-existent
Massive well done to everyone who made speeches today, especially @adamscharlotte3 and @ashleighblythe so happy for you both <PARTY POPPER>
@bethanrobinson_ Love you baba xx
@Mazz_X Will show you tomorrow morning Mazzy!
@sophieshepherdx Cute you!

Dear Matt Smith. Stop being so perfect, you're ruining my life. Lots of love, Ellie.
@Andrew_Weir You have such good things coming your way in the case
@Andrew_Weir The angel maker was especially brutal, but it was so clever that it made it almost okay
@Andrew_Weir They're all wonderful, Mads Mickelson is particularly good. Such good story lines as well
@Andrew_Weir The TV version with Hugh Dancy? Addicted to it, such good acting
Chevy thunder, Chevy Chevy thunder
I'm a realist, I'm a romantic
@AdamWalton1015 HOW DO WE GO TO THIS. I.MUST.GO
If Green Day do Hitchin' A Ride at Leeds, I will probably cry for the rest of the festival cause I won't be able to deal with the happiness
As long as Balthazar do Fifteen Floors at Leeds, the whole weekend will be worth it
@AdamWalton1015 It's fine!!! Luke is Wednesdays and Thursdays! NOBODY PANIC
Way too reassure her Francis, well done sweet pea
Made in Chelsea drinking game: take a shot every time Phoebe makes "jokey-but-actually-serious" advances on Jamie

@EthhHoll *get
@EthhHoll her rushing now!! 7 minutes ;)
Don't worry guys, @EthhHoll is going to sort the fog out for us 
The <POUTING FACE> face is actually really apt, because I'm angry about my face and that's actually how red it is...
I thought my face had just caught the sun badly yesterday and the redness would be gone today. I thought wrong. <POUTING FACE>
@AdamWalton1015 @charlie_smith95 don't need your shit Walton!!!
@Charlie_smith95 I'm coming!! We've had this discussion!
@hannahowen94 Obviously!! Can't think of anything better!
Actually got the nicest 6 months planned for the rest of the year, so nice having things to look forward too <WHITE SMILING FACE>
I started watching Hannibal this afternoon. Im now on episode 5. This is quickly becoming a problem...
What Did You Expect and Come Of Age are both albums I will never get bored of
Predicting at least one death in the mad rush for people to pay their deposits for the London psych trip tomorrow...
So, apparently I've gone back into my 'bands from Arizona' phase with a vengeance, just keep listening to the same five albums on repeat
@the_summer_set Fucking with everyone's mind since 4.6.13
"Use your knowledge of psychology to explain..." DON'T FUCK WITH ME AQA. JUST TELL ME WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT AND STOP WASTING MY TIME.
@chriss_thomass Thank you lovely! But I'm sure you know more than you think!!
I can't even enjoy the fact that tomorrow is my last exam, because I'm really nervous about the exam <PENSIVE FACE>
So annoying that study leave finishes the day after my last exam. Would like one day off exam free, but no <ANGRY FACE>
I'm going to have no money after exams with the amount of plans I'm making with everyone <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@shelbypine Well, that has made me a lot less panicy!
@shelbypine PRAISE BE. LIFE IS GOOD AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THIS KNOWLEDGE.
@shelbypine It does on stress but not abnormality if I'm thinking right? Cause I will cry with joy if I can talk about other stuff!!
I swear to god, if the 12 marker tomorrow is on cognitive therapies, I will break down because I can't write 12 marks just on CBT
@louisee_barlow Louise!! What is the name of the club dance from Turkey about Sean Paul?!?! Driving me mad!!

Oh my gorgeous Arizona, here's to getting caught with you
@AdamWalton1015 @leoniegab Not to burst your bubbles but London is during sabbatical and we go back after sabbatical. Sorry...
Excited for tomorrow, because my favourite band finally release their fourth album, and I'm so excited to hear it! @themaine
I'll be the happiest person in the world when Wednesday's exam is over <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no foolin' around. This ain't no Mudd Club, or CBGB, I ain't got time for that now.
Went to hand in a CV in Manchester and accidentally ended up staying to watch the parade... Oops.
Well, @the_summer_set absolutely blew my mind tonight! Such a wicked live band, recommend their gigs to anyone
@lucehartley_ I'll sing extra loud in your spirit
Hi perfect setlist. Oo, I'm so excited for tonight 
Can't be doing with adverts on 4OD. Wasting my time, let me watch my programme!!
@louisee_barlow This is a big stepping stone in our friendship
@louisee_barlow He's so beautiful it's almost illegal...
@louisee_barlow SAME ONE. What is this?!?! Never thought this would happen!!!
@louisee_barlow The one with the leather jacket?
@louisee_barlow As if we agree someone is hot... when has this ever happened?!?!
I'm really in the mood to watch Polar Express. Its May. May. The fuck is wrong with me
@ashleighblythe Trying to learn psych studies when my phone keeps beeping is just not happening <CRYING FACE>
I love my friends, but trying to get anything done while everyone's talking on a group message is literally impossible....
The first day you feel a bit better after you've been poorly is the greatest 24 hours of your entire life.
@becky_ashton95 Happy birthday lovely! Have a lovely day poppet xxxxxx
Oh well, in five years time we could be walking round a zoo, with the sun shining down over me and you.
@SeanPConnolly Really miss it, was such a nice show to be in!
@SeanPConnolly Oh god that seems so long ago! So weird that!!
My head feels like there's a million small people having a party in my brain and my sneezes hurt. I would like to get better now please.
Mum blaming my illness on looking at the books in the second hand bookshop on Friday, that's "filled with other peoples germs" Alright Fi...
Half the unis I want to see have their open days in the same week &amp; I'm not entirely sure how I'm meant to get from Kent to York overnight..
The noises my cat makes when he's dreaming are ridiculously cute
Listening to Legendary while revising is getting me very excited to see @the_summer_set on Saturday!
Just wrote my self a CV. I sound like such an up myself prick in it, it's awful. I wouldn't hire myself in a million years.
I really need to get up and revise but the cat is asleep on my legs and I feel to mean moving him... That's me staying in bed then
@sarahrichiexx everytime phoebe makes something awkward on purpose
Made in Chelsea drinking game: take a shot every time Louise and Andy remind you that this is the happiest they've ever been...
Hate arguing with people, always makes me feel like shit
Worrying how attractive I find Justin Young even though he currently looks like a hobo who hasn't washed in an year &amp; a half....
Attempted to put a tent up to see what it'll be like at Leeds. Basically, I'll be surprised of one of my friends doesn't end up murdered...
Well, @the_summer_set opened the main stage magnificently 
Such nice weather for Slam Dunk <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>
The cafe song from Rom and Ju just started playing in Starbucks. So much nostalgia happening right now.
Lovely having a couple days break from revision, watching films tonight, book shopping with Naomi tomorrow and Slam Dunk on Saturday!

@becky_ashton95 @ethhholl DON'T SHOUT AT ME ASHTON
@alderson_lauren @ethhholl It's not a play! Basing it on a book called Sorry, tell you all about it tomorrow before the general exam!
@EthhHoll @alderson_lauren The aim of our theatre class is to corrupt Lauren
@alderson_lauren @ethhholl A very sassy and sweary badass. Not Lauren character at all, acting challenge ;)
@AdamWalton1015 @charlie_smith95 @ethhholl Okay Bennett, calm down
@AdamWalton1015 @charlie_smith95 @ethhholl .... You're still Bennett
@AdamWalton1015 @charlie_smith95 @ethhholl Typecasting now Adam! Tempted to do tomorrow's general studies with your eyes closed?
@Charlie_smith95 @ethhholl I was going more dark, but whatever floats your boat
@EthhHoll Cast and everything....
@EthhHoll Be awks if we don't now...
Discussing next years devised theatre piece on snapchat with @EthhHoll when we've not even finished our AS exams yet....
@JosieHiggins_ Better than I expected! Feel okay about what I wrote, so I'm happy!
So happy history is done and I don't have to worry about it anymore <PARTY POPPER>
@AdamWalton1015 ... It's history Adam, I need all the time I can get
@AdamWalton1015 Revising!!
So weird being first in the sixth form centre. Feels like the start of a bad zombie apocolypse film...
Hope my encouraging messages will inspire me to wake up properly tomorrow morning 
Punching my own face would probably be the less painful option if we're honest.
I could do the document question in tomorrows history exam or alternatively I could repeatedly punch myself in the face.
Had C'est Le Vie by Bewitched in my head all day thanks to Year 13 theatre this morning. Thanks guys...
@t_philosophers @gblagden Any chance of a UK airing or something similar? Looks fantastic!
@Andrew_Weir It's your special skill, could put it on CVs and everything
I will sell a kidney to AQA if they put nice questions on tomorrow paper
@Andrew_Weir Andrew Weir: the ray of positivity in all of our lives...
@Andrew_Weir True, AQA is an exam bored of people who hate everything and everyone!
@Andrew_Weir It may interest you to know that Januarys 12 was attachment, so here's hoping they'll switch it up a bit and be nice!
History is so interesting and I love learning it, but I really fucking don't want to take an exam on it...
@Tails_ Dont make me jealous! So expensive, but how amazing would it be?!
@Tails_ The one in Reading?! How much do you want a go, looks fucking awesome!
Praying for a movement question in the theatre exam on Tuesday, because I have my Beautiful Burnout notes down to an art <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Always look weird when I write my theatre notes, trying to recreate someones body language or facial expression so I can write about it...
The fact that the general studies exams last longer than the time we spent learning about general studies proves its a waste of time
@rosiekeppie Yes! Talk about it tomorrow when we're both in for general studies?
@rosiekeppie Don't rub it in! I'll sit here and cry in my inferior, non-poncho blanket
I really want to start watching Hannibal, but I also want to pass my exams, so y'know, decisions..
@rosiekeppie i am jealous, all I have is this, MY ARMS ARE SO COLD 
Thought "why dont blankets have a head hole so its practical but my arms are warm. Whys no one thought of this!" They have Ellie. Ponchos.
