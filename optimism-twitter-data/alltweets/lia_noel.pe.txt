@emilyziegler_ @maryuspontmercy i think this is my favorite post so far: 
@emilyziegler_ @maryuspontmercy i'm scrolling through the abstinence tag on tumblr and i can't stop laughing
@emilyziegler_ @maryuspontmercy i'm crying
@emilyziegler_ @maryuspontmercy "true love waits, and waits, and waits" something tells me this wasn't his idea
@emilyziegler_ @maryuspontmercy wait abstinence following marriage is a thing??
the girl in front of me is watching the lion king that's how boring this class is
@emilyziegler_ he's adorable and just asked if he could switch seats since there's assigned seating in this class. awk.
@maryuspontmercy @emilyziegler_ WHAT EVEN SEND ME THIS LINK
@emilyziegler_ tHIS IS THE SAME GUY THAT I'VE SPILLED BOTH GOLDFISH AND CHEX MIX ON IN ONE CLASS SESSION SO HE SHOULD BE USED TO THIS
@emilyziegler_ i can't stop laughing
@emilyziegler_ i'm in class and i just took a drink of water and i spit it all over my desk and the guy next to me's book oops
@emilyziegler_ OMG
@emilyziegler_ THE KNIFE SLIPPED AND NOW I'M NINE FINGERED FRODO HELP ME
my sister: don'T COME IN UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY
I'm gonna go drench mys‚Ä¶
@emilyziegler_ dO IT I AM BEGGING YOU TO DO IT
@emilyziegler_ he was not as amused as I was
@emilyziegler_ when my brother brought his gf over for the first time I looked at her and went, "I could eat you and not take any insulin"
@emilyziegler_ this is you in my mind now: 
@emilyziegler_ i'm so so so proud of you
my stats professor has spent an hour u teaching everything the sub taught us last week???? can she not??
things I google at 12:24am: how many times does Texas fit into Australia 

10.95 times in case you were curious at 12:24am too
@lia_noel @Beth_Grayce @eoincmacken IN CASE YOU MISSED IT THE FIRST TIME I GIVE YOU THE SWOOSH:


I should probably sleep now, but finding out that the Swooshy (@eoincmacken) is TC is just too exciting and my sister and I keep squeeing.
@lia_noel BEHOLD THE SWOOSHY


@lia_noel (also look at me not paying attention to actors)
LATE NIGHT REALIZATIONS: TC FROM NIGHT SHIFT IS THE ONE AND ONLY SWOOSHY FROM MERLIN. WHAAAAAT.
well now I'm going to be super tired all day tomorrow but at least I watched the night shift
(dilemma solved: my bloodsugar is now too low to sleep so naturally I'll watch @NBCNightShift while I wait for it to go back up)
@skyofthetiger I have killed three bushes and they still gave me my license <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I ALWAYS FORGET THAT @NBCNightShift IS ON AFTER @NBCTheVoice AND START PANICKING BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE UP EARLY BUT ALSO I CANT NOT WATCH
my father is definitely not reading this paper because he used to be in politics and I basically bashed politicians for 1200 words
we're big fans, in case you were wondering @matkearney. 
well now my computer's going to die so I should probably write my paper.
@JaguarHero1 AHHHH ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS!!
@maryuspontmercy gIVE IT TO ME
(STILL PROCRASTINATING HAAAA)
i went from listening to country music to justin timberlake in roughly 0.56789 seconds
i think i should turn my music down because the phone was ringing and it was literally right next to me and i couldn't hear it.
i'm basically just ranting about politicians in my paper. oh well. #donttellmydad
this counts as starting my paper, right?? time for a study break? 
watching music videos is much more important than writing a paper. right???
procrastination: needing to write a paper because it's due by midnight, but just....not writing it.
high bloodsugar also makes me hostile. i just screamed at my anthro professor's announcements on canvas. like, literally screamed. idk, man.
I'm this close to crying because I'm hungry but also high BG and I just want food and lemonade and jelly beans
I also reALLY WANT JELLY BEANS BUT NO
my average bloodsugar has been over 300 today and I think I'm dying
my day has consisted of a lot of Mendelssohn and Palmgren. (also I have not played the piano in a very long time.) 
i literally have no words and i'm trying to write a letter of recommendation and this isn't working help
next type of cake I'm going to bake: vanilla buttermilk cake with blood orange frosting. um yES.
apparently I'm going to the Insurgent midnight premiere??? I have to work at 7 the next morning??
@shessoloverly pIZZA
@noirmentality EXACTLY. LIKE I HAVE NO PROBLEM BUYING THE SMALL THINGS BUT WHEN ITS A $100 ON CLOTHES I FREAK
side loading dryers were not made for tall people. all of my clean laundry just nosedived onto the dirty floor. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
(in other words I just spent way more money than I have on clothes that I actually really did need and I'm stressing out now)
WHY DOES SHOPPING MAKE ME SO NERVOUS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
@emilyziegler_ i can quote the whole thing and i don't even feel guilty about it it's that old
@emilyziegler_ I WAS JUST A WEE CHILD 
A NEARLY FIVE YEAR OLD 
IM SO OLD 
IM CRYING

Him: I hope my late wife doesn't mind me remarrying.

My Ghost: *‚Ä¶
@emilyziegler_ wAIT THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE WAS 2000 IM SO OLD <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@ResukiArt I've watched 2 people who don't speak English try to get an appt. + 3 girls flirt with the guy at the desk. Can I go home now? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Literally everyone in the waiting room has been called back. Except me. This isn't fair. #collegeprobs
I'll just sit here and people watch for the next hour. Not like I have a novel to write or anything. #NaNoWriMo
I'd rather be sleeping. Or writing my novel. #NaNoWriMo #ewschool

I just want to get home from school and spend time with my @NaNoWriMo. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

reading @sportswithjohn 's tweets about this game. if you're not, you're doing something wrong. #NFLPlayoffs
meh. sacked. #luck
@sportswithjohn just kidding again...only 7 now. ;)
perhaps I should just not watch football. every team I've rooted for does poorly.
well. the Cowboys didn't make the playoffs and the Saints are out. I guess I'll go for the Colts now. #Cowboysfan4lyfe #NFLPlayoffs

someday I'm going to make a giant chocolate chip cookie out of all the cookie dough in cookie dough ice cream.
@hipstermermaid preferably one of the Doctor saying I'm so sorry.
you would not believe the weird looks I get when I say that I'm looking forward to pre-calc and anatomy. #homeschooled #immanerd
next year @whatisgishwhes won't be able to handle the awesomeness that is my friends and I. #theteaspitters

@skyofthetiger I thought my sister's birthday was Friday but it's not????
now her birthday is Wednesday??? I think I need to get a calendar...
apparently it's my sisters birthday tomorrow and forgetting something like that is frowned upon??????
parties are not complete without fuzzy socks. even if it's eighty freaking degrees in your house. #YOLO
@skyofthetiger partayyyyyyyy
OH MY GOSH GUYS I KNOW CINDERELLA!!! HER NAME IS @skyofthetiger
@skyofthetiger yes of course! we'll tweet each other and share virtual oreos all night long. :D
why go to bed early when you could have a party of one with twitter and oreos? #stayingupallnight
@skyofthetiger  is going to bed early even a thing?
once upon a time I decided to go to bed early and then I got on twitter instead. the end.
so Capaldi is the new Doctor. Don't know how I feel about this just yet... #DoctorWho

you know you're a diabetic writer when...you're writing a scene involving food and you count the carbs in their meal. #T1D #CampNaNoWriMo
First typo of Camp @NaNoWriMo happened yesterday. "I stumble in the dark, brushing against a man with cornrow brains." #campnanowrimo
Three books on preorder slated to arrive on November first. Uh-oh. &gt;_&lt; #Nanowrimo
Only one day left to enter @AnnaMittower 's giveaway of the book Angel Eyes by Shannon Dittemore!! 
My mother just texted me a picture of hairspray at target. It had a 'caution: explosive' label. #notusingthat
Cleaning my room. I really need to do this more often. #itsreallylivedin #buriedunderapileofclothes
My mom thinks Guy Fieri's mouth is made of iron. #hekeepseatinghotthings #tripleD
@HarrisonCraig7 best rendition of you raise me up ever...you've definitely got the voice. Best of luck from your fans in the States. :)
"This is the valley of the shadow of death," Rupert said quietly. He smiled slightly. "We will fear no evil." (@ndwilsonmutters)
@NaNoWriMo My novel's coming along swimmingly! Hoping to make it to the halfway point tomorrow. How are all of you doing? :)
@NaNoWriMo Flashlights, pen and paper, and as much hot coffee as possible!
Rocking out to @coltondixon and eating brownies. Perfect end to a stressful week. #itstheweekend #finally
Meeting of the Midnight Society on @Narniaweb with good friends and virtual snacks. #itsoctober #spookystories
So excited to launch a new blog w/ a friend on Sunday. #betesbuddies #youcandothis
Current writing assignment: write about your favorite writing project ever. Alrighty. @NaNoWriMo it is! &gt;8D
Plotting my @NaNoWriMo novel while drinking [sugar free] raspberry tea and listening to @owlcity. Today is a good day. ;)
What? No #DoctorWho in the closing ceremony?! Sadness. :(
@davidboudia through God all things are possible. Congrats on the gold!! :)
#ThatAwkwardMoment when you once again forget that you have a twitter. :P
@IamChrisMann LOVED hearing you sing Viva La Vida on Monday. You've definitely got the voice. :)
Working feverishly on my @NaNoWriMo... 4.8k done today. Hopefully I'll be getting even more done. Being sick has it's perks.
My sister and I have written a @NaNoWriMo song. To the tune of 'I've Got A Dream' from Tangled. I have too much time on my hands. :P
#thatawkwardmoment when you realize you have a Twitter account, but have never used it.
