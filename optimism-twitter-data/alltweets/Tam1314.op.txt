@jimjamieson @Casumptious @Different_Name_ @ProudPleb I'm shocked that you think highlighting racism is childish. Coburn should be kickedout
@hannahjames40 @DavidCoburnUKip on this. If you can't see that it's a good thing for a child to have a named person to go to, then Idespair
@hannahjames40 @DavidCoburnUKip So if there is a problem, then that child has a named person to turn to for help. I'm not posting any more
@jimjamieson @Casumptious @Different_Name_ @ProudPleb 
@DavidCoburnUKip @simon_telegraph Exactly what I said
@GussyJackson The child would have someone to go to, lots of abusers are known to the child
@GussyJackson @DavidCoburnUKip if it saves one child then it's worth it. At least to me it's worth it !!!!
@GussyJackson @DavidCoburnUKip Its for the child to have someone to go to.
@John_j_Williams what a load of rubbish that is
@DavidCoburnUKip @John_j_Williams The child will have a "named person" that he/she can go to in confidence
@WingsScotland #figrollsareamazing 
#figrollsareamazing 
@GussyJackson @DavidCoburnUKip Do you know for certain that the child next door or a few streets down is not being abused
@John_j_Williams @Tramps_Like_Us_ @DavidCoburnUKip You are an idiot !!!!
@WingsScotland I love fig rolls, what ye saying !!!!!
#figrollsareamazing
@John_j_Williams @DavidCoburnUKip but back to my original tweet, you want abused children to suffer in silence and have no one to turn to
@John_j_Williams @DavidCoburnUKip That's just a stupid statement and you know it
@John_j_Williams @DavidCoburnUKip GIRFEC !!!!
@DavidCoburnUKip Nothing happens unless the child initiates it. They have a NAMED PERSON that they can go to
@DavidCoburnUKip and that's exactly what this act provides
@geom66 @glasgowcathcart These folk are expressing their views, do you have a problem with that
@DavidCoburnUKip the abuse that was handed out to them
@DavidCoburnUKip So you don't want children to be able to have someone to talk to, would you rather they suffered in silence and just took

@FraserNelson balanced reporting yet again. Can you do a report on the other parties mobs please
@BBCJamesCook @JimForScotland Can you ask Jim about his friendship with Kieran Simpson please
@jamesjayazz @AndyMcC73 @theSNP interests first

@jamieszymko I get the feeling it won't be covered by any TV companies
@DaftLimmy @katiec1314 @blairmcdougall Limmy, I'm still waiting on him denying he used fear tactics on the old and vulnerable during indy.
@BBCJamesCook @LillyLyle @NicolaSturgeon A public apology to Nicola would be a start to me respecting you again James

@polleetickle @Hethers01 Wasn't @JaneCollinsMep made to apologise for that lie she and @UKIP made up

Here it is... 
@jamesjayazz of westminster and the media
@jamesjayazz because of the amount of TV coverage this guy will get. He will scare the poor and vulnerable yet again with the blessing
@BygoneMedway @ln2718 I'm more impressed with the guy up the flag pole

@ScotTories hahahaha, have you actually looked at what your party is doing in westminster.
@RogerHelmerMEP @DavidCoburnUKip retweeted by 

@martinmccluskey @StorminTormod see that pledge, is that like a vow
@martinmccluskey @nataliemcgarry Well this is embarrassing for you Martin
@JimForScotland @Marfrman Have you paid your taxes yet
@Nigel_Farage @DavidCoburnUKip Why is Coburn still in a job 
@David_Cameron @Conservatives How is this contract panning out 
@David_Cameron so you are coming to the four corners of Scotland
@robbiewilliams better off with a Bosey from your missus
@DavidCoburnUKip 
@DavidCoburnUKip 
@DavidCoburnUKip haven't you been sacked or resigned yet for your terrible racist slur
@scottishlabour @TheScotsman It must be so disappointing for Slab to tweet something and every reply is slagging it off
@scottishlabour @Margaret_Curran 30 years on and poverty is on the rise. You must be so proud of your whole career.

@SNP_Broxburn @katiec1314 I was at School with Malcolm <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@julieannaaitken @johnnypict @StFilansDream @Sun_Pol_Scot @theSNP I can understand that, they want a strong Scotland with a voice
@Xarundel no one is sulking up here, we realise we are part of the Union, it's a shame WM doesn't want us to have a voice tho
@Xarundel @derekstillie @BritishSos Not once we become independent, but while we are part of the Union the scotland will be part of everythi
@JimForScotland Ye watching ???
@derekstillie @Xarundel @BritishSos And for that to happen Scotland needs a strong voice
@derekstillie @Xarundel @BritishSos I don't have a problem with that at all, but it should be Scotlands decision
@AlynSmithMEP

@BBCJamesCook @tonyconvery1 "Snp threat" was pretty bad. I have to admit that I see James as quite fair in his reporting
@gregmoodie @vonny_bravo I use a Lanyard for fly fishing
@derekstillie @Xarundel @BritishSos Have you seen the tories plans to knock 12 billion off the pocketmoney we get back
@derekstillie @Xarundel @BritishSos Why do you fear a country that just wants to make things better for its people
@RuthDavidsonMSP @AlexSalmond @HTScotPol It certainly won't be you Ruth <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@ScotTories @RuthDavidsonMSP any pics of how you got on this morning

@derekstillie @Xarundel @BritishSos you think toxic, I think fear
@ChrisDarroch2 @wfimidlothian @blairmcdougall @scottishlabour I'm still waiting on a comment about using fear in the indy campaign

What comment have you about Jim Murphy claiming for rent in London when he owns anoth…
@KatieEwen123 Good Morning to you too <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@PearleenSangha @scottishlabour @pamela_nash losing on the fashion stakes as well I see
@LondonSNP @theSNP is it being televised today
@Xarundel @derekstillie @BritishSos but no real evidence they were Scots or SNP supporters
@Small4W @scottishlabour Can you smell it, I can !!!
@RealRareFacts somehow I don't quite believe that
@Pottymad @scottishlabour @JimForScotland Don't worry, no matter what he says it's all just one big party
@scottishlabour @JimForScotland quite a few of the same folk in the four pictures

@Xarundel @BigGfaetheBigG oh, and it was London. But don't let that get in the way of some SNP bashing
@Xarundel @BigGfaetheBigG If this was true it would have been all over the news. More than likely just heckled
@LibDems so your picture is telling lies
@jamesjayazz @dido15 There is over 50 mps on the make with this, just one SNP.
