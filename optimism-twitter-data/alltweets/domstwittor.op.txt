@molliethorpe dont give up
Ed milliband was abput as left wing as labour will get in my opinion. Goodbye to a half decent opposition.
Althoough that worries me because ukip did disgustingly well on votee
Labour are always gonna be pretty fucked without the scottish vote
Bring on endless austerity! 
It may be time for electoral reform
@DanHesketh but MINT! Expected labour
Which ya may be forced too anyway
@DanHesketh not running for mp in mg constituency which i assume is your constituency too
Can vote as councillor but not mp..

@DanHesketh who ya votin dan
@SimonYorkCA i meant ukip not green!
@SimonYorkCA good lad
Im goin off at aload of people on mollies fb who voted green coz 'theyre gonna give 3m to the nhs' facepalm and a half

Fed up of the status quo? GREEN

Fed up of the poor/disabled/young? TORIES

Fed up of the Tories? LABOUR

Yo…
HOLY MACARONI NOOOOOO.
If only bnp and ukip were as irrelevant as i wish they were we'd be fine and greens could male a positive change in the country
I wish we lived in a fair and civilised society where proportional representation could be used &amp; not allow extremism into our parliment

I'm sick of that bearded bloke from the North Pole coming to this country every December and giving his…

@molliethorpe  
@SimonYorkCA when push comes to shove he'll take one. If people woke up to the joke ukip is id be all for prop rep
@SimonYorkCA im just abit annoyed greens are only max gonna win another 1-2 seats if that and cant help influence the vote and join labour
@SimonYorkCA aslong as theyre a real promise it was impressive. Loved niges propaganda vid too hah! And be optimistic! Im feeling optimistic

@Jaywoodall7 if carrolls 35 and David luiz is now 50. Lallanas a good 80mil ;)
@Jaywoodall7 that'd be class for you
@Jaywoodall7 aye i know. You getting lallana too?
@Jaywoodall7 ngl that's shit.. Should have got some playing time and been a soton key man
@Jaywoodall7 at lfc... I love the guy. He's a top notch player, but like with Suarez and sturridge where does he go
@Jaywoodall7 Gerrard would need a pretty forward role. No big lads to win headers up front. Oh btw.. Please explain how lambert will fit
@Jaywoodall7 all the Lfc lads in there ;) all the youngsters will be in rivalry to out do the rest. That could be a mess or a goal frenzy
I do admire Milner. He's a tank who never gives less than his best
Hard to not have Henderson, milner, sterling or lampard. Prefer an alternative to jagielka and Johnson too
Hart | baines cahill jagielka johnson | lallana Gerrard Barkley ox | lambert sturridge. There we go. My XI
Here he is.
Hendos another great prospect for the future. Matured amazingly at lfc. Not surprised playing with Gerrard. Can't overlook him
@paulomyftaraj @DanHesketh they were from defensive positions. As a goal keeper he was like an elegant gazelle
@paulomyftaraj Morris in attack, myftaraja in centre, Dawson in defense and @DanHesketh in net. World cup contenders anyday
@paulomyftaraj why did you never get a call up
Im shocked Nicky Hunts England career never took off. Sure he's still knocking about..sign him up
Fuxk me that was brillaint
1 week and im FREE
Didn't even know wishere was still on
Englands young attacking force is quite plentiful and impressive. Shame our defence isn't as promising
@paulomyftaraj i admire your thought processes
Barkley confidence is clearly one of our best assets. Give the guy more time and he'll only improve. Outshines wilshere
What a fucking goal
@itsamyyywbu aslong as they were semantically processed you'll be fine
remember a talk in which i said i could never kill anyone. Thinking noe theres a number of 'Celebrities' i would willingly put In a volcano
Who's englands first choice central defenders gonna be? Cahill and whom?
Cant even decided who id play in mid if i was Hodgson. Lallana and sterling wings but central i really don't know
@Jaywoodall7 that reminded me of year 2 goal snatching. See £300,000a week isn't enough for that class
@Jaywoodall7 haven't heard his name basically all game
@Jaywoodall7 he has his moments but he's inconsistent.. He's apparently our star player.. He's not even our best striker
There's plenty better than him, i wouldn't even start him in the England squad myself
Expectation. Whether that's his issue or the fact he was over hyped im not sure. But many consider him one of the best in the world.. For me
A bad player but i think the hyp around him if way over emphasised. He was a very prolific youngster but hasn't for me lived up to his
Don't get me wrong im hoping i get proven wrong in this world cup but for me Rooney doesn't perform on a world stage.. He's by no means

@ThatBucketList YAY FOR ENCOURAGING CRIME
Its just occured to me that I could just put a concert on instead of snooker.. gpod music amd motivational applauses. Silly dom
Attic rooms are perfect for revision. Curved ceiling means if you put post its on they hang so you can just sit on the bed and read them
Anyone on here doing psychology
Putting snooker on whilst revising is much more effective than music. You get an encouraging round of applause every 5mins
I think ill be okay in these exams
I wouldnt say im in the slightest a politically Intellegant guy.. but I know enough to be pessimistic about a ukip govt
I wonder what percentage of ukip voters will be properly politically clued up
This taxi driver is brill. Currently having a huge debate on gay marriage.. im defo winning

My lack of interest in modern football grows everyday
You already have. No one should be able to just say, fuck it lets spend like 300million, that'll sort it. Thats bullshit
Owe about that much in borrowed money, why should that be allowed. Thats not fair play. Pay off what you owe and use the mass talent

To train and play to loyal fans. Passion is dying off, football is mad

Im glad bwfc arent a world class team so were not corrupt like the bigger clubs..atleast we give youngsters a chance and field eng talent

I really wish I could take more of an interest in football but the money issue is too apparent in todays game. Passion is dying off
