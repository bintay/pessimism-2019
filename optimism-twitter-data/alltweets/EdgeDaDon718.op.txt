@JoelRomainNY Dupree no I rather  Beasley  I want more offense  talent  no excuse for the qb
@JoelRomainNY I think coples. Will gave a monster  yr I would go offense  if it no fowler  I want cooper or white  Marshall a FA next yr
@JoelRomainNY no.... thanks he is overrated   the d line inflated  is sack numbers they gotta go offense
@JoelRomainNY either of the 3 white cooper or trade down ...select Gurley
If San Francisco  chose  A Rod  instead of Alex smith boyyyy  shit would be soooooo different

I can't see phil in a winning  type of yr developing a rookie I don't see it
@Hello_Davey @PattyWhite_NYM @Hey_its_Don 

I would do cousins cause he is themost realistic of the 3 if you draft a dude  they won't be him
@RDotG @Hey_its_Don @PattyWhite_NYM   

After gasol he is the 2nd best center in the league
@Hey_its_Don @PattyWhite_NYM 

I think phil and fisher would do  wonders for him
@Hey_its_Don @PattyWhite_NYM 

I would trade it for cousins
@Hello_Davey @SNYtv 

If it's not cousins  or durant  nope
