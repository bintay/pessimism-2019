@AcunaAndrew Also, WALT DISNEY WAS THE PREVIOUS AUTHOR! XD
So, tonight's Once Upon A Time is basically everyone having to live really bad fanfiction. XD
Berry shortcake that my Mom made! #HappyMothersDay @GordonRamsay 
@SharperPnFFan @AcunaAndrew @Mesousa2877 @mmonogram @VinMan17 
@SharperPnFFan @AcunaAndrew @Mesousa2877 @mmonogram @VinMan17 is gonna be on Mikey Murphy.
@AcunaAndrew @Mesousa2877 @mmonogram @VinMan17 @DanPovenmire But the fact that he's already cast means that he's playing a pretty big part.
@AcunaAndrew @Mesousa2877 @mmonogram @VinMan17 @DanPovenmire Man, do we really have to wait two years for this?
@Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew @mmonogram @VinMan17 @DanPovenmire Hmm... Maybe playing Mikey!
@Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew @mmonogram @VinMan17 @DanPovenmire Yeah, probably. XD
@AcunaAndrew @mmonogram @VinMan17 @DanPovenmire Phineas is a supporting character CONFIRMED. Half Life 3 CONFIRMED.
@SplashyRainbow It's @mmonogram and @DanPovenmire. Of course it'll have songs!
@zyanmaliks That's actually NOT the end.
@lillisavoie Also, I don't think this is the last we've seen of the P&amp;F gang. I'm hoping that they'll appear in Dan and Swampy's new show.
@lillisavoie Ah... Well, that sort of already happens anyways! Cuz it's a show for everyone! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@lillisavoie @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@lillisavoie Why don't we just start making them now?
@HannahBeth68 Did you hear that it's ending?
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram I keep forgetting that it's Mikey. The Y is throwing me off for some reason. XD
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram (But it'd be even better if they were regulars on the show. Even if they're not the main focus.) #JustSayin
.@DanPovenmire @mmonogram So yeah, I totally want to see the P&amp;F crew cameo on Mike Murphy's Law. At least once.
@rwmead Well, if they actually are planning on bringing them back, everything would make a lot more sense.
And really, I don't see why that couldn't happen.
Plot Twist: Mikey Murphy also takes place in Danville, and Phineas and Ferb are supporting characters.That would be pretty awesome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Doof_Fan We shouldn't be fighting, because we're all on the same side.
Me: Can I go home?Ashley: No, we have enough people, but they want to open up secondary spots.Me: We're not even busy today!
"We are the Moms." Also known as @alikigreeky's theme song. #HappyMothersDay
@JulietteElton @AcunaAndrew @itsPlanty There's just something really fishy about all of this. Swampy said he'd E-Mail me at some point.
@JulietteElton @AcunaAndrew @itsPlanty I mean, it's the longest running show in Disney Channel history, and we only get a month's notice?
@JulietteElton @AcunaAndrew @itsPlanty This whole thing just seems really off to me.
@itsPlanty So again, why not just say that the show is ending then? Why use the word "hiatus"? It just doesn't make sense.
@itsPlanty Still, if this was the plan all along, we would've gotten something way sooner than this.
@itsPlanty They care way too much about their fans to do this so abruptly.
@itsPlanty If this was really their choice, they wouldn't have waited until a month before to say "Oh yeah, by the way, show's over. Sorry."
@itsPlanty If they had made the announcement at Comic-Con, it would've still been a bummer, but at least we would've been prepared.
@itsPlanty If they had said that the show was ending about a year ago, I could see it being Dan and Swampy's decision. But A MONTH?
@itsPlanty No, but we know that no Disney show has made it past Season 4, and apparently, they're determined to keep it that way.
@AmandaTheHoser I at the very least want Disney to consider picking up a movie again.
@AmandaTheHoser I don't know, this just doesn't feel right.
@itsPlanty It just doesn't add up. Something's not right.
@AmandaTheHoser But you could start a new summer the following year.
@AmandaTheHoser yeah, but that doesn't necessary mean that the show's over. They could always jump to next summer.
@itsPlanty But if it was their decision to end the show, why would they have ever thrown out the word 'Hiatus'?
@AmandaTheHoser Yeah, LDOS was always the S4 finale.
@itsPlanty Why, if it was their decision, would they ever say that? Why wouldn't they just say: "Yeah, we're wrapping up" at Comic-Con?
@itsPlanty True, but for all of last year, they said: "No, it's not ending. It's just a hiatus."
@AmandaTheHoser Swampy also said that this whole thing is really long and complicated.
@AmandaTheHoser Well then, I don't know. This whole thing just feels off to me... It's so abrupt.
@itsPlanty I know. XD
@RTcartooncrush Who's crushing on Planty? XD @itsPlanty
@harleylynchr5 I don't do that, mainly because there are too many people I'd want to shout out to.
@harleylynchr5 Like #FF people? XD
@BogheadEX @AlexVyaz_2012 Yeah.
@AlexVyaz_2012 If it actually was their decision to end the show, they would've said so at Comic Con.
@SharperPnFFan @AlexVyaz_2012 @ridiculousmark I didn't know his Twitter handle, but yeah.
@AlexVyaz_2012 And why would they do that? No, they were trying to fight it.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Gravity Falls has a set plan. There's a beginning, middle and end. And I'm pretty sure the plan was for three seasons.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Kim Possible was created by @Rschooley.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Who knows? Production codes can get changed around.
@AlexVyaz_2012 That never happened. She was saying that to make herself feel important.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Of course they're not gonna say that the show got cancelled, &amp; that Disney screwed them over. (At least, not on the record.)
@AlexVyaz_2012 Uh, that's not true. It aired in Russia. She didn't do anything.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Have you ever heard the phrase: "Don't bite the hand that feeds you"?
@AlexVyaz_2012 How is what he (it's a guy) did helpful at all? Bullying the people who make the show is pretty damn stupid.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Stop being an idiot.
@AlexVyaz_2012 *And, not if. And if you're not.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Again, even if they wanted to post spoilers, THEY LEGALLY CAN'T.
@AlexVyaz_2012 You totally are. It if you're not, you're acting EXACTLY like him.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Also, I think it's pretty funny that you had to make a new account because everyone blocked you.
@AlexVyaz_2012 Um... Even if they wanted to spoil new episodes, (which they don't, because it ruins them) THEY LEGALLY CAN'T.
@hustler4life_ Because they happen before the parks open.
@PipersPicksTV Did you hear the news about Phineas and Ferb? :(
@AlexVyaz_2012 @JulietteElton Go away @isabellaflinnsh.
@jk_rowling @JMcGilchrist93 Miss Rowling, you are AWESOME. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@jk_rowling @JMcGilchrist93 Lol
@pinkimwest This feels alot like what happened to Kim Possible. Does Disney remember how that ended? (We've started petitions.)
@pinkimwest Therefore, this is a cancellation
@pinkimwest The only time you don't announce that the show is ending beforehand is when the show gets cancelled.
@pinkimwest It doesn't add up. Even on Disney Channel, they usually announce: "the final season!" They're just trying to brush this off.
@Mesousa2877 But if it was really a planned ending, don't you think Dan and Swampy would've announced it at Comic Con?
@AmandaTheHoser Announcing that the show's ending a month before isn't a planned ending. That's Disney trying to brush off a cancellation.
@AmandaTheHoser Why would they have constantly said that it's not ending?
@AmandaTheHoser But if it really was their decision, why didn't they announce it at Comic-Con last year? It makes no sense!
@thefinebros I saw your sister working at Spaceship Earth once.
@pinkimwest What's worse is that I'm pretty sure this WASN'T Dan and Swampy's decision. If it was, they would've announced it at Comic Con.
@Doof_Fan If it was their choice to end the show, they would've announced it at Comic-Con last year.
@Doof_Fan I would be able to accept this if it was Dan and Swampy's decision, but I really don't think it was.
@The_real_Baymax You need to go watch some of the newer episodes. Season 4 was great.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew We can't just take this. We've gotta fight it.
@DigiRanger1994 @Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew If this was planned, they would've AT LEAST announced it at Comic Con last year.
@DigiRanger1994 @Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew It being announced like a month before air... That's a cancellation.
@DigiRanger1994 @Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew If this was a planned ending, it would've been announced way sooner.
@DigiRanger1994 @Mesousa2877 @AcunaAndrew Actually, I'm saying that it IS being canceled.
@Zython86 @vex0rian Season Four was actually the show at its very best! (Highlights include a Night of the Living Dead spoof and Star Wars.)
.@Perryplatypus22 @change_es 50 supporters so far! Let's keep it up! @AcunaAndrew
Did I forget to mention that I'm working 'til 9:00? Well, I am! And it's all overtime pay! #MakinThatPaper
@cvogle105 Did you hear about Phineas and Ferb?
@halrudnick @dickfundy @screenjunkies #CancellationSeason #Constantine #PhineasAndFerb #Forever
@NaiveRoyal Hey!
@DigiRanger1994 @Eagullfly @starbutterfly96 @AcunaAndrew Yeah, I'm just not interested.
.@starbutterfly96 blocked and reported for spam.
@starbutterfly96 @DigiRanger1994 @AcunaAndrew First of all, Steven Hillenburg created Spongebob.
@DigiRanger1994 @starbutterfly96 @AcunaAndrew Yeah, I'm about five seconds away from blocking him...
@starbutterfly96 @hellofathead @AcunaAndrew @alikigreeky @zombietardis GO AWAY. CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE BUSY???
@starbutterfly96 @DigiRanger1994 @AcunaAndrew Meanwhile, we're all over here mourning the end of Phineas and Ferb. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Eagullfly It's got a good cast... Channing Tatum, Christina Applegete... Freaking Ice Cube...
@kaleighbrillon SAME.
@ParksByDoom @UniversalORL It's 50 bucks for an annual pass. #JustSayin
@ParksByDoom @UniversalORL You should go to Wet 'N Wild!
@quacketeer I guess at least Phineas and Ferb is going out while it's on top...
@xStarVsEvilx Hey!
"I'm a Disney Imagineer, and I'm here at a Sophia the First Lego Duplo party"Me: STOP WASTING TIME ON THIS AND GO WORK ON STAR WARS LAND.
"I WILL WAIT FOR YOU!"Me: I will wait! I will wait for you!"I will wait! I will wait for you!"Me: Holy crap, this is like Moulin Rouge!
My only question: when Maria got bitten by the snake, did nobody think to check for pulse and breathing?
I just watched The Book of Life. It was pretty cute! (And the animation was fantastic.)
@PhineasNFerbHub @alikigreeky -Starts sobbing again-
@BogheadEX It's just such a cheesy song. XD
I think I'm gonna buy another Perry plushie and donate it to the Gingerbread House @GKTWVillage. #PhineasAndFerbForever!
@jalecxagriffin Not the last episode! #LastDayOfSummer
@AcunaAndrew @nprmonkeysee If not for Phil, do it for Carol. She's so adorable! @kristenschaaled
@AcunaAndrew @nprmonkeysee If Last Man on Earth gets canned, I'M GONNA LOSE IT.
@AcunaAndrew @nprmonkeysee This is turning into that year where Alcatraz, Terra Nova and Flash Forward all got canned.
@nprmonkeysee But the stupid thing is that PHINEAS AND FERB IS POPULAR.It's just on Disney Channel.
@AcunaAndrew @nprmonkeysee Yeah, Constantine got canned too.
@nprmonkeysee Can we stop killing good shows? Is that possible?
Apparently there's a YouTuber named @ItsMikeyMurphy. I wonder if he's heard about Mikey Murphy's Law yet...  @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@AcunaAndrew @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Yep!And if I can't get the day off, waterslides are good too. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Hopefully I can take Sunday off so that I can go ride some rollercoasters. It's what Phineas would want. #CarpeDiem @danpovenmire @mmonogram
@Imagineer2017 They wouldn't need a third Soarin' theater if they other two they have actually ran at full capacity...
@Nacie @DanPovenmire @mmonogram But then again, that's pretty much how long we had to wait between new episodes of P&amp;F during Season 4. XD
@Nacie @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Too bad we'll have to wait until 2017...
@Nacie @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Yep, at least there's that! I'm excited!
@Seththefanman @AcunaAndrew @Eagullfly That's like, the bare minimum of what I want. WE NEED THE OTHER TWO.
@Nacie Did you hear the bad news? #PhineasAndFerb
@Imagineer2017 No, but Phineas and Ferb is. (Almost.)
@CarlyMcQueen_ @VinMan17 We all are.
@Eagullfly @SimpleCap @otisframpton How it Should Have Ended.
@Eagullfly @SimpleCap @otisframpton (I already made two fan made P&amp;F "episodes")
@Eagullfly @SimpleCap @otisframpton HISHE is a series on YouTube. They do movies, and sometimes TV shows.
@mmonogram The outlet store is basically the clearance section from World of Disney. You never know what you'll find there.
@Imagineer2017 Please pause for a moment of silence in front of the P&amp;F World Showcase Adventure for me. <CRYING FACE>
@SimpleCap @otisframpton The only problem I could think of would be animating the mouth for any of the sideways facing characters...
@rachanne99 Well, at least we still have fanfiction.-Starts sobbing-
You know, I think a Phineas and Ferb "How It Should Have Ended" would be pretty fun. What do you guys think? @simplecap @otisframpton
@rachanne99 -sigh- jokes like that are what I'll miss the most.Granted, Dan and Swampy are doing a new show, but this sucks.
@TrivWorks Phineas and Ferb is ending. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@imagineeringdis There's literally no space... Anywhere.
@KatieTierneyH GO READ THEM. (They're great!)
@MissMabelton My brother is obsessed with that game.I'm mourning the impending end of one of my favorite TV shows...
@SharperPnFFan @mmonogram Yes! Also, Season 4 needs to go on Netflix.
@MissMabelton What's up?
@tiffjaquith Did you hear the news?
@awhselenator We must show them... THROUGH THE POWER OF NETFLIX! @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@SplashyRainbow Amazon! Quickly! (I'm probably gonna order one.)
@MissMabelton Hey!
@ottohadjacent They need to at least keep selling merch.
They didn't have the plushies I wanted, but I got a pretty cool hat! @DanPovenmire @mmonogram 
The key to parking at a ridiculous outlet mall: follow someone who is going back to their car.
Everyone should buy some P&amp;F merch today. I'm going to the outlet mall to buy two plushies.
@mmonogram I'm going back in in five minutes. I'll do so when I get home. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mmonogram I figured.
@mmonogram I'm just extremely confused.
@TheJosephGamboa @DisneylandToday Totally!
@mmonogram @THR And why did you call that one guy an idiot when he was right?
@mmonogram @THR So, why did you guys keep insisting that P&amp;F was simply going on hiatus?
And I don't care that the show's ending: I still want a Phineas and Ferb ride @DisneylandToday.
@RidleyPearson I'll be mourning the loss of Phineas and Ferb, and praying for a movie...
@THEVlSl0N Did you hear about Phineas and Ferb ending?
Mr. Foley: Ms. Liz! Ms. Liz! You wanna hear about Phineas and Ferb?!Hilarious, but BAD TIMING. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
I'm gonna have to get a copy of that.
Today's announcements are a caricature of all of us, and my station ID was AMAZING.
OH MY GOD, THEY NAILED ME. XD
@HogwartsLogic And Phineas and Ferb is over. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@AcunaAndrew @PhinabellaFan29 @Rschooley Disney's like: end the show yourself, or we'll just cancel it.
@AcunaAndrew @PhinabellaFan29 I feel like this is similar to what happened to Kim Possible. @Rschooley
@SourceFedNERD Well, it's as much of a theme park as Harry Potter is a theme park. It's gonna be a land. And it'll be AWESOME!
"@h0olian: NOOOOOOOooOoOooOooOoOooOoOooOooOoOooooOooOoOooOoOooOooOoooOoOooOooOooooooOOooO 
@h0olian Ah. So you did.
@h0olian Did you hear the news?
.@Snoopy @DanPovenmire @mmonogram @hellofathead @alikigreeky @zombietardis 
@zombietardis So, are a lot of you guys coming back to Mike Murphy's Law?
@westcoasternet Well, at least Dan and Swampy have a new show! (And other stuff that they're working on.)
@DigiRanger1994 As fun as a Muppet episode would be, I'd rather get the other two Star Wars specials. <WINKING FACE>
@AgentCmom #Fanfiction
@PhinabellaFan29 Still holding out hope for a movie or a spinoff. (I think a movie could definitely happen.)
@classy_kyle1 Made up. Not real. Purely for comedy's sake.
@hustler4life_ Star Wars and Night of the Living Pharmacists were GENIUS.
@SirOwenDisney @UniversalORL Still holding out hope for a movie.And a ride. Which would spawn from a movie.
@hustler4life_ You should watch some of the newer episodes. Season 4 was AWESOME.
@HashtagShenani @BreezyPuffs Actually, I should say: "No. No, I'm not."Well, at least Dan and Swampy are working on a new show.
#FutureTextsFromMomI just saw your post that Phineas and Ferb is officially ending. Are you okay? @HashtagShenani @BreezyPuffs #NotOkay

Onwar…
@Cw700CP There's still Star Vs. And Gravity Falls. And Dan and Swampy are working on a new show!
@TheManwellMC Well, there's still Gravity Falls and Star... And Dan and Swampy have a new show!Unfortunately, we've got two years to go.
@KatieTierneyH One spinoff that doesn't suck.
@MagicCityMayhem I'm still waiting for Disney to build that Phineas and Ferb ride...Looks like a movie is our only hope now. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@MagicCityMayhem Wow, I didn't even think about that! That would be cool!
@EvilThursdays Also, I had a Starspeeder 3000 from @DisneylandToday. #ChildhoodDreamToys (Super sad about the Phineas and Ferb news, BTW.)
#ChildhoodDreamToys Forget toys, I just wanted to be friends with #PhineasandFerb. @EvilThursdays #LastDayOfSummer
And I want the whole thing to be animated, as opposed to just one scene. It deserves that much.
Danville High School ChroniclesThree Part CrossoverPhineas and FerbGravity FallsInside OutDespicable MeHow am I gonna do this?
@PixarCorner Right.Excited!
@SirOwenDisney @UniversalORL Unfortunately, it's not a super great time to be a Phineas and Ferb fan. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@PixarCorner Why don't they just call it: 'Marvel's Civil War'?
@PixarCorner I'm pretty sure we already knew that though. XD
@DrDoofEvil Not a good time. <POUTING FACE>
Guys, thank you so much for such an AMAZING show. It's been a great ride. I wish you all the best with Mikey! @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@ThemeParkUnited You guys should post a shout out to the Phineas and Ferb World Showcase Adventure. #PhineasAndFerb #LastDayOfSummer
@DisneyChannel Can't hear you. Too depressed that Phineas and Ferb is ending. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@SharperPnFFan Well, the show's officially ending.So there's that.
@itsPlanty @DanPovenmire Whoever at Disney Imagineering came up with a ski lift at a waterpark is GENIUS.
@itsPlanty @DanPovenmire #WetNWild #SoManyStairs
@AcunaAndrew @mmonogram @DanPovenmire When is Haunted Mansion already?
@Sir_Mapleleaf #TooSoon
So, as depressed as I am that Phineas and Ferb is ending, it's NOT the end of @DanPovenmire and @mmonogram making stuff! So, there's that.
@jacksfilms When it was announced that Phineas and Ferb was ending.That was today. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Phineas and Ferb is ending because the boys are too busy building everything in Orlando. #Kong #Nintendoland #Avatar #StarWars #VolcanoBay
@tenflake @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Why does anyone let M. Night Shamalyn direct ANYTHING?
@AcunaAndrew @mmonogram @DanPovenmire Yeah, but that'll be enough for Disney to realize that the demand is still there.
@mmonogram @DanPovenmire If that does really well, (which, of course it will) maybe Disney will call you guys. Hopefully! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Well, I went from stoked about Nintendoland to sad about Phineas and Ferb in 3.5. #LastDayOfSummer #PhineasAndFerb @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@mmonogram @DanPovenmire Especially since they're doing an Adventure Time movie on the big screen...
@mmonogram @DanPovenmire I mean, we're still waiting for that Kim Possible movie, but who knows!
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram AND KEEP MICHAEL BAY AWAY FROM IT. HE RUINS EVERYTHING. XD
@DanPovenmire <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram Also, I don't care if the show's been wrapped... We need the other two Star Wars specials!
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram Also, I'm still holding out hope that you guys can come back and do a movie at some point.Not in 20 years either.
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram <DISAPPOINTED FACE>Well, it was a great run. Now if Disney could just air the rest of the episodes, that'd be great.
@AcunaAndrew @DisneyXD START AIRING IT AGAIN.
@MorphanScout @JayInFlorida #VolcanoBay #Fall2016
I can tell
@fowlowlerson MarioKart, Star Fox, Zelda... Maybe a Pokemon show and a Smash Bros show.
@Attractions @UniStudios @Nintendo MarioKart, a Star Fox coaster that's like Mummy meets Men In Black, Zelda...
@h0olian King Kong, Donkey Kong, Volcano Bay... #GoBigOrGoHome
@MS_Ookami With Universal's recent track record, I know it's gonna kick ass.
@fredchicken_ Well, it's not a full theme park. It'll be a land like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
@RobaatoX And knowing @UniversalORL's track record, it'll be AMAZING!
@RobaatoX Not considering. IT'S HAPPENING.
@ZeldaUniverse I don't know about a rollercoaster, but a dark ride, definitely.
@scarlettashley1 I swear, Phineas and Ferb are behind all this.IT'S AWESOME. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@CGrevlos MarioKart and Star Fox were my first thought. Excited!
@rwmead I want Mario Kart and a Star Fox indoor coaster. Also, a Zelda dark ride.
@motherboard It's gonna be AWESOME.
@Mike_PiFF03 Yeah, Mario Kart would kick ass.
@MS_Ookami It's gonna be in one of the two parks at Universal Orlando, alongside Harry Potter, Marvel and others.
@NMUFred Still exciting! Universal's creative team even managed to make Transformers good, so it's gonna kick ass.
@NMUFred It won't be a whole theme park, but a land at Universal Orlando. (Alongside Harry Potter, King Kong, Despicable Me &amp; others.)
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL Yeah, I was gonna say, if they REDID Ripsaw and Popeye...
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL And there's supposed to be a new Popeye movie coming out.
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL And Dudley Do Right's is insanely popular, despite not being an overly popular character.
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL I don't think that's ever gonna happen. Tolken family doesn't want to play ball...
@UniversalORL is officially the geekiest theme park ever. I LOVE IT. XD
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL But at the same time, Universal can do a lot with a small space.
@UUOPodcast @kingdomofwalt @UniversalORL Nah, Toon Lagoon had two of the best water rides around. If it's in Islands, it's probably LC.
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL That Posideon's Fury building is HUGE...
@dizwire @DrunkAtdisney Slippy the toad meet-n-greet. Wait time: 0 Minutes.
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL Yeah, I was thinking Lost Continent
@ShonenStyle @TheBitBlock @UniversalORL Yeah, they could do head mounted displays!
@luchagringo Probably Kidzone or Lost Continent.
@eefey69 @thetimtracker @UniversalORL Nah. They're not willingly giving up Marvel.
@AmusementBuzz @UniversalORL I was thinking Lost Continent, but that works too.
@ParksByDoom @UniversalORL I was thinking it could replace Lost Continent.
@GamingCypher @UniversalORL @NintendoAmerica Well, not a theme park, but definitely a land.
@RichOBJ @UniversalORL MarioKart and Star Fox DEFINITELY.
@ShonenStyle @TheBitBlock @UniversalORL Lets see... Big indoor rollercoaster that would be a cross between Mummy and Men In Black... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@TheSnitchSeeker @UniversalORL MarioKart and Star Fox for sure!
@UUOPodcast @kingdomofwalt @UniversalORL Mariokart, Star Fox, Legend of Zelda... And maybe there could be an interactive Pokémon experience.
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL Also, STAR FOX!
@kingdomofwalt @UUOPodcast @UniversalORL What about an interactive Mariokart ride? XD
@hulitherium I'd much rather go to @wawa.
@hulitherium They're too expensive anyways.
And @pizzahut saves the day! And the mom who put "Call 911" in the comments section is smart as hell. 
@MASTERCHEFonFOX @GordonRamsay And a bananas foster chimichanga with a fruit salsa for dessert.
@MASTERCHEFonFOX @GordonRamsay Baja style Fish Tacos!
@KevDGrussing Sounds like exactly what's happening with Phineas and Ferb.Either that, or we're getting a spinoff.
@larythecucumber The other two were great too. One was about stopping an eternal winter, and the other was a Night of the Living Dead spoof.
@larythecucumber It's gotten really good. They've had four great hour longs so far this season. Two were crossovers. (Marvel and Star Wars.)
@larythecucumber Also, I need the other two Star Wars crossovers. I know for a fact that Dan and Swampy want to make them...
@larythecucumber There was supposed to be a theatrical movie, but it never happened. I'm still up for it.
@Juyayappy Also, I'm friends with Swampy. (One of the co-creators of the show.) He's a pretty cool dude! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Juyayappy Probably.
@Juyayappy Eh, I think it's a fakeout, and they have something else planned for that relationship. XD
@Juyayappy And the most recent one... The Phinabella fangirl episode. #ActYourAge
@Juyayappy Highlights of Season 4 include:Fun Marvel crossoverAMAZING Star Wars crossoverNight of the Living Dead spoof...
@Juyayappy That episode was from Season 1. We're at the back end of Season 4 at the moment.
@Juyayappy Cuz I've watched the episode. Many times.
@Juyayappy That's the episode where they get 'busted', right? Candace and Jeremy break them out.And then things get WEIRD.
@polaroidofmalum @honestfandom Phinatics!
.@MCCANNSMVP @honestfandom You're not really in the fandom until you've followed all the writers on Twitter. <WINKING FACE> @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@larythecucumber There's only one movie, but yeah, it's a great show.
@Juyayappy That's why Candace broke them out of that awful place.
@FafaGroundhog @gloveandboots Just throwing it out there. I would help you guys with it, obviously.
@FafaGroundhog @gloveandboots Also, I sent you guys an idea for a blog topic via E-Mail. Don't know how often you guys check it, so...
@FafaGroundhog @gloveandboots What about hashtag games?
Yeah, @tomorrowland looks awesome!
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE TRAILERS FOR @tomorrowland! NO SPOILERS!
@23duff @DanPovenmire, @mmonogram and their team are some of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

My favourite bit!
@23duff "Someone said he shot first, but I could've sworn it was the other guy.""This isn't a friend ship. It's a space ship."
@derekburgan @hatetofly @DrunkAtdisney BANANA!!!!!!!! #Minions
@23duff It totally is, isn't it? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@jk_rowling @cIaricestarling I like you much better in this universe. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco (I work at the original waterpark, actually. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>)
@LegitKuzco And I think a good chunk of the rides at Volcano Bay are gonna be hydromagnetic water coasters.
@LegitKuzco The only one at Wet 'N Wild that ends with you being underwater is Storm. Well, and Blast if you fall off.
@LegitKuzco You could buy goggles! <WINKING FACE>
@LegitKuzco Side note: the Kong rode looks WAY COOL.
@LegitKuzco Yeah, that could work, but I think Jaws would make much more sense at the water park.
@LegitKuzco The next generation waterpark that Universal is building.
@LegitKuzco Updated ride effects are different.
@LegitKuzco I'm hoping they have a new and improved Jaws ride at Volcano Bay.
@LegitKuzco Also, the tribute they paid to BTTF in the queue video for Simpsons was pretty amazing.
@LegitKuzco Yeah, but updated animatronics are different.
@UniversalORL @halrudnick @dickfundy @andysignore #ReignOfKong
@LegitKuzco At Disney, yes. But at Universal, people wouldn't complain. Especially if it's something like updated animatronics.
@Park_Journey @UniversalORL Of course it's going to be different. And it's going to be longer and more immersive too. That building is HUGE.
@LegitKuzco Homestly, as long as they looked good, people wouldn't care.
@LegitKuzco  Yeah. Again, they fixed a lot of them. They look better now.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 I rode it a couple weeks ago, and it looks great.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 Yeah, it took some time for them to get a return on investment, but they fixed a lot of stuff.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 Well again, they've had more time and money to fix stuff like that. They look better now.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 That explains it. After Potter opened, they had a lot more money to spruce up rides and fix things.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 When was the last time you rode?
@Maustallica I guess the biggest problem would've been flying the whole cast out to the set... Or rebuilding the set there.
@Maustallica Well, I was saying the episode. Sorta like how the Cap 2 episode was.
@FeministFailure @imransiddiquee Bahahaha
@BleedsOnB It wasn't the game changer that everyone was expecting, (I wasn't) but it was a ton of fun!
@Maustallica I thought it was gonna be kinda Rosencrantzy, where they're in the city DURING the attack, trying to get people out.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 I don't know, the animatronics still look really good!
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 They want to make sure the movie does well first.
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 They're probably working on a Jurassic World tie in as we speak.
@lantenengo I payed 45 bucks for a tux and 50 for a ticket. That's it.
I'm not supposed to be focusing on the guests there. I'm supposed to be focusing on the tubes. And the conveyor was giving me hell today.
I got visual audited, and I did pretty well with everything except guest service. AT SURGE CONVEYOR.
@mmonogram @Gaby_Kastro2 I just realized that I never got my birthday doodle...
@LegitKuzco @rwmead @DigiRanger1994 Fast and the Furious is supposed to be getting a new ride soon.
@PhilGibble @bingmobo What gets is that she actually had an arc and character development!
@rwmead @DigiRanger1994 And he chose between Jurassic Park and Ripsaw Falls.
@PhilGibble @bingmobo I just don't understand what the problem was with Black Widow's portrayal in Avengers. I thought it was great!
Waiting for the King Kong announcement like... @UniversalORL 
@SuperheroFeed Yeah, just call it Marvel's Civil War.Whatever. Excited!
@SuperheroFeed It'd be a better movie than Batman V Superman, that's for sure.
@Nacie "You better blow 3 whistles, because you take my breath away." #OnlyWorksOnLifeguardsWithThatParticularWhistleSystem
@WaltsFrzenHead If there's one thing that could actually compete with Harry Potter, it's Star Wars!Well, and Marvel. Universal is 2 for 3.

At 11:15, Star Wars land announcement. You wanna play, Universal?
Today's agenda: Go to work, figure out cap and gown, and figure out what I'm doing at Valencia.
#KongWatch2K15 @UniversalOrl
@DrunkAtdisney @UniversalORL Opening in two weeks.
@DrunkAtdisney @UniversalORL Well, I don't think they'd use that font to advertise the Nascar Sports Grill...
@DrunkAtdisney @UniversalORL King Kong!
@RTcartooncrush What the hell?
@hulitherium I thought it was just: "You know what, you people don't deserve my time and energy." XD
So, Whedon didn't even leave Twitter because he was annoyed with idiots calling him sexist. He left because he wants to focus on writing.
@bingmobo @PhilGibble @verge I'm fairly certain he's joking...
@hulitherium @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Now, Isabella WAS created to be Phineas's love interest, but her character has been fleshed out.
@hulitherium Why is it the main people who get criticized are the ones who make a point of writing strong female characters?
@hulitherium @DanPovenmire @mmonogram And Isabella, while obsessed with Phineas, has way more to her character. Same with Candace.
@hulitherium @DanPovenmire @mmonogram They're a freaking Girl Scout troope...
STAR WARS CROSSOVER! #AgentsOfShield
@ThemeParkUnited It's 2015. How does Back to the Future work?
@ThemeParkUnited Jaws.
@Vodstok @icandyapple Seriously @kleenex, you guys should team up with @PixarInsideOut and make limited edition tissue boxes.Because PIXAR
@Vodstok @icandyapple Inside Out: We literally have a character named Sadness.@Kleenex: We should sell boxes of tissues at the theaters!
@SrDippingSauce Too bad you guys don't have @wawa in Oregon... Because of them, I never have to eat fast food again.
@ashleytisdale Wouldn't that be a...FRENCH BRAID?!?!YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! #BadPuns
So yeah, I'm pretty excited for @DisneyInfinity 3.0!
@poniewozik @mikepriceinla @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Last Day of Summer: Phineas and Ferb do ALL THE THINGS.
@k_narrow @SharperPnFFan @DisneyInfinity YES.
@DisneyInfinity Calling it now: 4.0 is Indiana Jones.
@k_narrow @SharperPnFFan @DisneyInfinity Gravity Falls!
@DisneyInfinity After all, Phineas and Ferb Star Wars is the best crossover EVER. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@DisneyInfinity You guys better throw in Phineas and Ferb's souped up landspeeder. XD #PhineasAndFerb #StarWars
So, @DisneyInfinity made an awesome announcement today!Too bad we all saw it coming. XD #StarWars
@clarkgregg I'm interested to see how this ties in.
@screenjunkies @halrudnick @dickfundy @andysignore Speaking of which, how come Inside Out wasn't on anyone's Top 10 list?
@dickfundy Yes, because you weren't being nitpicky in 'How to Fix Marvel'.
@screenjunkies @halrudnick @dickfundy @andysignore And this right here is the best cross promotion EVER. 
@hustler4life_ #EmbraceYourInnerWhiteGirl
@dickfundy Black Widow rocked too!
@wescraven Daredevil on Netflix!
@BlueJaigEyes @travisthegrimm But we have to wait until Civil War to see Bucky again...
@Rschooley @imagineeringdis I think the most recent one is probably Gringotts. Harry, Ron and Hermione break in, and all hell breaks loose.
I'm interested to see what Scarlett Johansson has to say about this. She'll probably agree that it's stupid.
And if you're really complaining about anything that Tony Stark said...This is Tony Stark we're talking about.
"She was a damsel in distress!"She got kidnapped by Ultron, but she kinda saved herself. Also, she saved Hawkeye.
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram (Isabella's always been one of my favorites. She's awesome!)
"I'm a monster."A) She was saying that to make Bruce feel betterB) She was referring to the fact that SHE'S A TRAINED KILLING MACHINE.
A girl can be interested in a guy. That's not sexist. THAT'S LIFE.
By that logic, @DanPovenmire &amp; @mmonogram are sexist for making Isabella have a crush on Phineas. Forget that she's a great character.
"Joss Whedon is sexist because Black Widow flirted with people!"This is the stupidest one. Wasn't she flirting with Cap in Cap 2?
@erinisasellout Right. If he's sexist, why would he have ever made Buffy?
@boldlygaying So, how is he sexist? And what would make you say that he's transphobic?
@aquirtea He makes a point of writing strong female characters. Hell, even Cabin in the Woods had a really strong female protagonist.
@erinisasellout Not to mention, she's saying it to make Bruce feel better.
@erinisasellout I think people are just mad that she didn't kick more ass. But (ironically) Scarlett Johansson was pregnant.
@aquirtea I've watched quite a few of his movies and TV shows. What exactly is the problem?
@erinisasellout But she was talking about her being a monster because she's a trained killing machine. Being made sterile was anecdotal.
@boldlygaying Have you actually watched anything that he's made? Including the most recent Avengers movie?
@TresDean333 WHAT WAS SEXIST ABOUT THAT MOVIE?!
@CratesNRibbons Have you watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
@erinisasellout SHE IS A TRAINED KILLING MACHINE.
@aquirtea What exactly did he do wrong in Avengers?

Whedon. Joss Whedon.

I don't... even...
So yeah, the @wawa version of a burger is pretty amazing.
@BDisgusting HORRIBLY. GODDAMNIT. WHAT IS WITH AUTOCORRECT TODAY?
@BDisgusting The Tim Curry version isn't horrible scary...
@SharperPnFFan @DisneyInfinity I'm.
@SharperPnFFan @DisneyInfinity Star Wars. I telling you.
"What's with all the hype surrounding @Wawa?"Have you been there?"No."Then you have no idea.#GottaHaveAWawa
@CallMeJudas_ So, how is that Joss Whedon's fault? He probably had more stuff written for her, but then that happened.
@vonglitzer Also, she was pregnant, so they couldn't do as many action scenes with her.
@CallMeJudas_ Also, wasn't Scarlett Johansson pregnant while they were filming?
@calumsfluff *aired
@calumsfluff There's not much going on in the fandom atm, (mainly because Disney hasn't aires anything since FEBRUARY) but you can join!
@vonglitzer Also, he has zero control over what movies they make. That's up to the head of Marvel Studios.l
@vonglitzer One of the most popular things that he's done features a really strong female protagonist, and you want to say that he's sexist?
@vonglitzer Joss Whedon is definitely not sexist.
@CallMeJudas_ And, damsel in distress? Were these people watching the same movie?
@vonglitzer And if he's sexist, then explain Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Checkmate.
@vonglitzer Plus, Scarlet Witch was also extremely well written!
@vonglitzer They gave her tons of character development, which was great!
@vonglitzer The love interest stuff was a very small part of the movie, and as for being a damsel in distress... Didn't she save Hawkeye?
@CaitlinCarrigan People are IDIOTS.
@ZenKaneda Joss Whedon just didn't want to deal with the bullshit from idiotic SJWs who somehow misred that entire damn scene.
@vonglitzer @MattfDoyle That's not Joss Whedon. He's leaving anyways.
@CallMeJudas_ Yeah. She was calling herself a monster because SHE IS A TRAINED KILLING MACHINE.
@CentralMorgan The "Tall Darth and Handsome" store would be pretty amazing too. XD
@CentralMorgan They need a specialty ice cream shop like Florean's in Star Wars land.Also, the Mos Eisley Cantina!
@CallMeJudas_ I absolutely loved what they did in the movie! With both female characters!
@quacketeer Wha'd you think? Wasn't it great?
@foxandfriends Good.
@calumsfluff Not even close. #Phinabella
@hulitherium Seriously, if someone did that, nobody would ever hear from them again.
@hulitherium Roleplay 101: You're not supposed to say: "Hey, Isabella is in love with you." Because nobody would ever do that in the show.
@PhillyD Where are you?
I'm thinking about creating a Phineas roleplay account...
@arnoldtblumberg And @josswhedon just quit Twitter.Good job, trolls. Good job. -facepalm-
@Vodstok I don't know... He killed off -SPOILER-?
@JamboEveryone Dole Whip.
@deadcooI What do you mean? Killing off -SPOILER-?
@arnoldtblumberg Anyways, as far as DC goes, they need to hire someone like @josswhedon to save it. Heck, maybe even get Joss Whedon.
@arnoldtblumberg I went with my brother after work on Saturday. I get discounts at the AMC at Universal. (I work at Wet 'N Wild.)
@arnoldtblumberg You of all people haven't seen it yet? Wow. XDAlso, BEST STAN LEE CAMEO EVER.
@arnoldtblumberg I get that DC doesn't want to make another Batman and Robin... But that's why you hire a director you KNOW can pull it off.
@arnoldtblumberg What made Age of Ultron great was the action combined with the jokes. It was fun, awesome, and absolutely hilarious!
@arnoldtblumberg DC has no idea what the hell they're doing...I'm hopeful, but... Oh man...
@k_crawface And it's AMAZING.
@spookycasey "And, none of this is canon, so just relax."
@FunSpotAmerica Meanwhile, Phineas and Ferb are souping up their go-kart with Pod Racing engines. #PhineasAndFerb #StarWars
I wanna ride the Hulk at some point this week in honor of #AgeOfUltron. @UniversalORL
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies But he didn't even try!
@lookslikeme @screenjunkies Grocery Store Wars is great, but I'm talking about TV specials.The Phineas and Ferb one is my favorite. :D
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies More specifically, SUPERHEROS ARE SUPPOSED TO SAVE PEOPLE!
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies But SUPERMAN IS SUPPOSED TO SAVE PEOPLE.
@otisframpton @MarkWassmer What's awesome is that Disney's basically just hiring great directors/writers who love the franchise.
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies Compare that to Age of Ultron, where they actually CARE about the civilians...
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies He can fly. Surely, he could've found a way to move the fight and avoid killing THOUSANDS.
@otisframpton @SimpleCap "Why can't we just call them Mutants? That's what they are. Enhanced implies that that they were modified"
@DanPovenmire People complaining, and I'm like: "Um, that's not the actual poster."
@otisframpton @SimpleCap You guys should throw in a joke about not being allowed to use the word "Mutants."
@otisframpton @SimpleCap (As far as actually making the characters.) And the backgrounds and stuff, of course.
@otisframpton @SimpleCap Hey, at least you just need Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision. Everyone else is ready to go.
@otisframpton @SimpleCap You guys haven't even started, have you? XD
@goodyk I thought it was better than the first one!
@otisframpton @SimpleCap Woohoo!
@plumbmusic #WetNWild
@otisframpton How long until the Avengers HISHE? @SimpleCap
@William_Spike @TheQuicksilverr Eh, he's probably just mad that -SPOILER-
@josswhedon Congrats on Age of Ultron! It was fantastic, and I can't wait to see the extended cut!
@CentralMorgan But do they have "BLUUUUUUE ICE CREEEEEEEAM!"? #PhineasAndFerb #StarWars
Marvel's Derpdevil #TypoTV
May the 4th be with you! #StarWarsDay #StarTours @DisneylandToday 
@testtube27 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies But we didn't get a standout performance.
@testtube27 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies The action was fine, (other than the fact that Superman let millions of people die)
@testtube27 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies The problem with Man of Steel is that there ISN'T really an enjoyable performance like that.
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies Also, even if he didn't want to save people yet, HE STILL COULD'VE TRIED TO MOVE THE FIGHT AWAY.
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies Yeah, I just thought it was boring and overly pretentious.
@testtube27 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies The Joker's insanity, and the way he interacts with other characters is what makes him memorable.
@testtube27 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies You know why Dark Knight was so great? Because of Heath Ledger's AMAZING performance as the Joker.
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies Age of Ultron was 2 plus hours long, but it felt like it was 90 minutes! MOS just dragged on...
@batboy1989 @glennking_439 @screenjunkies I mean, it's not as much that it's dark and Nolaney as it is that it's just not enjoyable!
@glennking_439 @screenjunkies They don't hate DC comics. They hate how dark, dreary and hopeless these movies are.
@NiftyMat Language!
@SuperheroFeed YES
@IronbaneDK @SuperheroFeed Notice that Marvel didn't immediately launch into Civil War... They're building it up!
@typicalamal I really want it to be good, but it just looks like we're going down the same road as Man of Steel.
@IronbaneDK @SuperheroFeed The source material is great on both sides. The problem is that DC is rushing it.
-Favourite for DC 
@typicalamal Unless it's directed by Zack Snyder...
FAV for DC

@BogheadEX @PnF_Fan19 Well, I'm getting most of that when the paycheck for the training video I did comes.
@PnF_Fan19 @BogheadEX I'm saving up to buy a 600 dollar computer.
@INF11B38B @Mom4mjtx @KaranEschweiler "Language!"
@MarkReadMusic Well, I guess that happens when all of your movies are this damn good!(Language!)
@cinemasins I spent last night watching the Avengers beat up Ultron. Still scripted, but MUCH more entertaining.
So, why the hell would people pay 99 dollars for a boxing match? Especially when you KNOW that it's always scripted.
@PnF_Fan19 @BogheadEX So THAT'S why everyone was standing outside of Tilted Kilt...
@APollard36 99 DOLLARS?!?! WHY ARE PEOPLE PAYING FOR THAT?!
@1Lcampesino Nah, but -SPOILERS-
Also, HOLY CRAP, THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!! @Avengers

@cinemasins So, I have three. Can't really pick one. They were all amazing.
@cinemasins Oh, and the pizza at Epcot's Via Napoli (in the Italy pavilion.) Best pizza you will ever have in your life!
@cinemasins Also, the Burgushi Bento Box I got @CowfishOrlando was fantastic! Mini burger and a spicy tuna roll.
@cinemasins @texasdebrazil, Las Vegas. It's a Brazilian steakhouse, so... Yeah. It's amazing.
@KatieTierneyH @TheHashtagGame #AlternativeAvengersMovieTitleAvengers: Raging Nerdboner
@screenjunkies @andysignore It's easily the most creatively put together one out there. It's also absolutely hilarious.
@screenjunkies My money's on the Phineas and Ferb special. I'm a little biased, but it's freaking amazing. @andysignore
@screenjunkies What is the best Star Wars special? (Robot Chicken, Family Guy, Phineas and Ferb, ECT.) #MovieFights
@PnF_Fan19 This is a pretty big year for Six Flags! Multiple rollercoasters, the Justice Leauge dark ride...
@PnF_Fan19 Yeah, Colossus has been there forever.
@MickeyXtreme Your post about Frozen Summer being as exciting as the Xcelerator hand driers.
@halrudnick @dickfundy So, Disney Channel is giving yet another middle finger to Disney's own legacy and doing this.

@Attractions I thought the Christmas stuff was over... Oh wait...
@JayInFlorida @derekburgan @JayFromPixels My heart belongs to @Wawa.
So, I found one that's HD, has an audio out port, AND, is waterproof that was a floor model they wanted to get rid of. 180 after tax.
It's hard to find a decently priced HD camcorder with an audio out port.
"Canon won't let us take it out"Well that's stupid. And pointless.
-At Best Buy-"Oh, we don't have this camera in store anymore. It's only online."Then why is it still out on the show floor?
@AcunaAndrew @SpongeWikia @Spongey445 <PERSEVERING FACE>
@descendantshq And the sitcoms, with the exception of Girl Meets World, suck so much now that nobody even wants to buy the merchandise.
@descendantshq But yeah, the DCOMS have sucked for a while. The last one I enjoyed besides TBM was the P&amp;F movie.
@descendantshq And if you enjoy classic musicals like West Side Story and Grease, Teen Beach Movie is really fun.
@descendantshq Because they need something to sell to the kids who are too young to care about Star Wars and Marvel.
@descendantshq But more importantly, it's a merchandise driver.
@descendantshq How is this different from Monster High? It's the unlikely offspring of villains (monsters) going to school. HIJINKS!
@itsPlanty Also, why did they cast Kristen Chenoweth as Maleficent? I love her, but that's some pretty weird casting...
@itsPlanty Yeah, and it feels like fanfiction. Not even the good kind, like Once Upon A Time.
@xStarVsEvilx Hey!
@itsPlanty It doesn't make any sense...
@descendantshq @MysteryTwinDipp Teen Beach movie was actually clever. This is just a mindless cash in trying to be the next Monster High.
Wait, what? WHY DO THEY HAVE LAPTOPS? This is a freaking fairy tale! It's not set in the modern day! 
Also, the evil queen in Descendants looks constipated, Jafar looks like a drug dealer, and Cruella looks like a crackhead.
@alikigreeky -Writes something at night-Me: This is amazing!-Wakes up the next morning-Me: This is AWFUL.
@billboard @KChenoweth She looks like she's having fun, but this is quite possibly THE WEIRDEST casting choice ever.
@LegitKuzco Well, it's the end of the year, and I probably have one left. But knock yourself out.
@MysteryTwinDipp Yep.
@MysteryTwinDipp I HATE the Bayhem Transformers movies. But the ride is pretty freaking cool.
@MysteryTwinDipp Well really, they know a good ride that will draw people in when they see one. Because their creative team is the best.
@MysteryTwinDipp But Wicked is great. The whole thing is about the 'Untold Story' of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good.
@MysteryTwinDipp If Universal had the rights to Phineas and Ferb, I guarantee you that there would be a ride.
@MysteryTwinDipp Wicked is great because it's kind of a Prequel/Rosencrantz to The Wizard of Oz. The whole thing is very well thought out.
@MysteryTwinDipp Yeah, and I wouldn't have had a problem with it if it had been done right, but the setup just didn't work.
@MysteryTwinDipp Disney needs to up their game. At Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, you can LITERALLY do spells.
@MysteryTwinDipp That movie was just ripping off the idea behind Wicked.
@MysteryTwinDipp Meanwhile, Universal has so many fantastic rides that the Meet 'N Greets never have a horrible line.
@MysteryTwinDipp Plus the emperor would make a pretty lousy Meet 'N Greet...Unless you get to throw him into a pit...
@MysteryTwinDipp So, four with the inquisitor.
@MysteryTwinDipp I always felt like that show was just made to promote the ride at Disneyland.
@MysteryTwinDipp Yeah, it's not like Disney has a shortage of villains...Does Star Wars even have 10 major villains? I can only think of 3
@MysteryTwinDipp But my point with that is that they OBVIOUSLY care about the show.Or they just have no clue what the hell they're doing.
@MysteryTwinDipp Disney doesn't even need to make terrible cash cow movies anymore. THEY HAVE MARVEL AND STAR WARS.
@MysteryTwinDipp But it's weird, because Bob Iger clearly DOES like the Phineas and Ferb. He IMMEDIATELY greenlit the Star Wars crossover!
@MysteryTwinDipp But on that note, A LOT of people have seen Phineas and Ferb. And Gravity Falls is doing pretty well with ratings too.
@MysteryTwinDipp You physically CAN'T see Song of the South. Because the NAACP doesn't seem to realize that it's a period piece.
@MysteryTwinDipp Yeah, well Ross Lynch was actually pretty good. WAY better than he is in Austin and Ally.
@MysteryTwinDipp Splash Mountain is in Frontierland here in Orlando because they didn't have anywhere else to put it. XD
@MysteryTwinDipp Well, if you like musicals, you should give it a chance. I thought it was gonna be terrible, and was pleasantly surprised.
@MysteryTwinDipp I think the biggest thing with that is that it's a spoof of musicals... Grease, Westside Story, and old surfer movies.
@MysteryTwinDipp P&amp;F has had merch for a while...
@MysteryTwinDipp The only good DCOM in recent memory was Teen Beach Movie. That was pretty fun, and the sequel looks fun too.
@MysteryTwinDipp A RIDE WOULD BE AMAZING.
@MysteryTwinDipp Also, how is there not a Phineas and Ferb ride at Disney World? I mean, the World Showcase Adventure is cool, but...
@MysteryTwinDipp @booboostewart @DisneyChannelPR "Our hit shows Phineas and Ferb and Gravity Falls? Yeah, stick em on Disney XD."
@MysteryTwinDipp @booboostewart @DisneyChannelPR Not to mention, Disney Channel has basically ditched animation.
@MysteryTwinDipp And on Once, they frequently make fun of the ridiculousness of everything. It's self aware and funny.
@MysteryTwinDipp @DisneyChannelPR Once... As freaking insane and ridiculous as everything is getting, has good actors and writing.
@LegitKuzco Start by giving a big middle finger to the animation that made this company what it is.

Disney Channel Meeting: Okay how can we piss the most p…
@MysteryTwinDipp @booboostewart @DisneyChannelPR It's just a STUPID concept. Once Upon A Time actually makes sense.
@rwmead Revenge sucks. Good.

@DisneylandToday Yeah, @Wawa's spreading like wildfire here in Orlando. It's essentially the best convenience store ever.
@DisneylandToday Oh well. It's still alive and well at @Wawa! Which is not on the west coast yet, but it's only a matter of time.
@jacksfilms Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
@OrlandoInformer @theorlandoeye Wha'd you think?
@DrunkAtdisney And they're adding more cool stuff on I-Drive. The view will get better.
@DrunkAtdisney I think everyone's just disappointed by the anti-climatic walk.
@BethKassab Of course they did.
@DrunkAtdisney @westcoasternet There's a lot of master planning going on right now. It'll get better... XD
@GraceysButler It'll get better. I-Drive is on the rebound.
@GraceysButler Hahaha
@Attractions @UniversalORL @theorlandoeye My guess is that J.K Rowling had to sign off on that.
@Park_Journey Yeah, they made the wheel walk sound like way more than it actually was.
Diagon Alley <HEAVY CHECK MARK>Orlando Eye <HEAVY CHECK MARK>KongSeaWorld coaster SkyscraperAvatarlandStar WarsFix DHSPhineas: We've got our work cut out. #Orlando
@ParksByDoom @UniversalORL So, I'm hearing he didn't walk all the way around...
@people THAT'S NOT THE WORLD'S TALLEST ROLLERCOASTER!
@theorlandoeye @NikWallenda @YardHouse What time is he gonna start?
Hey, thanks for the follow, @theorlandoeye! Look forward to finally seeing you spin!
@RikkiKlausWESH @theorlandoeye @WESH I wonder what they'll do for the opening of the Skyscraper...I'm pretty excited for that!
@RikkiKlausWESH @theorlandoeye @WESH That guy is INSANE.
@judyb4jesus @foxandfriends There's bigger issues in this country right now.
@judyb4jesus @foxandfriends My thought is: if gay people want to get married, fine. It doesn't affect my life at all.
@DisneylandToday Does Smokejumpers have touchscreen ordering like Taste Pilots did? Because that was pretty cool.
@mmonogram My question is... Why did she tag One Direction in this?
@hustler4life_ @DisneylandToday Did that replace Taste Pilot?
@Vodstok Huh...That's a good question...
@StandforMaya @Vodstok Yeah, I already know. It's BS that they're allowed to discredit SeaWorld.
It's bad enough that Blackfish has brainwashed so many people, but it's worse when they turn around and support PETA. #PETAKills
@noahcyrus Blackfish isn't even a documentary. It's propaganda, and it's not true.
@Ayo_itsSmoochi @SeaWorld @peta Blackfish is BS. If anyone's abusing animals, it's the nutjobs at PETA. They kill thousands of puppies.
@Ayo_itsSmoochi @SeaWorld @peta SeaWorld is all about rescue, rehabilitation, research and conservation.PETA is about BS propaganda.
@GonzaloMarginet @SeaWorld @peta Uh... They don't do that anymore.
@Skarabinos @peta I think you got SeaWorld and PETA mixed up. SeaWorld cares deeply for their animals. PETA kills thousands of animals
@SnarkWoodbury F**king PETA...
@USHToday Yeah, Jurassic World looks awesome!
@USHToday THAT ROBOT IS SO FREAKING COOL!
@USHToday I mean, the fact that they actually made BB-8 a real prop... That just shows how much time and effort they're putting into this.
@USHToday Yeah, there's not a doubt in my mind that Episode 7 will be AMAZING. J.J. Abrams knows what he's doing.
@USHToday Of course, Avengers and Star Wars will DESTROY IT. XD
@ccfreestyle Well, that and smartphones, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and touchscreens. Those are all pretty cool.
It's 2015. So far, the only really cool, futuristic invention we have is @ccfreestyle.
@ccfreestyle You just need to make the app for Windows Phone.
-At @Walgreens-Me: So, where's the regular soda machine?-Turns around, sees they have @ccfreestyle-Me: Best Walgreens EVER.
The umbrella I just bought at Walgreens could possibly be the best three bucks I've ever spent.
@autoarmadillo @xxdjsethxx And yet they get to use propaganda bullshit to discredit SeaWorld, which actually HELPS animals.
@cinmann1 @foxandfriends The Constitution protects the right to peacefully protest...Not this.
@tonygoldmark @FB_BMB Ideally, your job is something that you genuinely love!
@baker1150 @foxandfriends No, they're sending people to help stop the idiot rioters.
@thatfishscale Most of them are just doing their job, trying to keep YOU safe.
@thatfishscale Are there a few bad cops out there? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean that the vast majority of cops are murderers.
@Kralman @thatfishscale @FoxNews @BaltimorePolice Plus, how does this help anything? These protestors are just destroying their community.
@secretbee1 Plot twist: It's young @actuallynph!
@shesez2 @HashTaggAnarchy Shouldn't this person be DEAD?
@xxdjsethxx @autoarmadillo In retrospect, it was obvious that you were joking.Sorry. I'm just so freaking done with the PETA idiots. XD
@Vodstok "WELL WHAT ABOUT THIS AWFUL, CRUEL THING THEY DID?" Fake or severely twisted.
@Vodstok Always have, always will.
@Vodstok My Dad worked at SeaWorld when he was my age, and he can tell you that they cares more about those animals than anyone else.
@xxdjsethxx @autoarmadillo @peta You think that PETA is stealing and killing innocent animals because of beastiality?ARE YOU HIGH?
@Vodstok It sucks that they have to do this as a result of an organization that KILLS THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS A YEAR. F**K PETA.
@KatieTierneyH "I love this city!"-Blows the shit out of it-#KingpinLogic
@infinitespeech Yeah, Sony can definitely do no wrong... -COUGHCOUGHSPIDERMAN3-
@DrunkAtdisney I thought Grad Bash was on Friday...
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew And don't even get me started on how awesome Butterbeer is... #HarryPotter @UniversalOrl
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew And Escape from Gringotts isn't just a five minute ride... It's a 15 minute experience.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew It's a classic. As is Pirates of the Caribbean.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Forbidden Journey is really two attractions in one. The ride itself, and the Hogwarts tour.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Right. And all of my favorites are up there for amazing attention to detail and being immersive.
@Surfer_Clock @ccfreestyle Right. They're basically just printer cartridges with soda syrup. XD
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Yeah, Haunted Mansion is up there as one of my top 10 favorite theme park attractions.#1 is Harry Potter.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Last time I rode Haunted Mansion, everyone was reciting the stretching room monologue. It was AWESOME. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@ccfreestyle So, you could create a mix, save it, and then have the machine recreate it exactly?
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew "Is this haunted room ACTUALLY STRETCHING? Or is it your imagination?"
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew That and the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Disney's AWESOME when they get to do super creepy stuff.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew That sucks. It's easily one of the greatest attractions in Disney history as far as theming and story.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew You've never been on the ride?
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Hopefully! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>If I do, we're definitely going to Rubio's. #FishTacos
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew I wonder if we'll learn about her... That would be cool.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew I think one of my favorite scenes in Haunted Mansion is the bride with the axe. SHE'S SO CREEPY!
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew No. I'm hoping to this summer, though...
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew I'm still so mad that they don't do that here in Florida. It's AWESOME.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Also, I wonder if they could do a Haunted Mansion Holiday special... #NightmareBeforeChristmas
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew *NORTHWEST MANSION MYSTERY.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew And it should be pretty dark.Like... Northwest Mansion Manor dark.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew There's so many great stories on that ride that they could work with.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew I don't know, but I'm excited! It's gonna be a damn sight better than the Eddie Murphy movie. XD @danpovenmire
@CBSNews Good!
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Just search up 'Dan Povenmire Haunted Mansion'
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Disney did a whole press release about it.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Unstable is a cartoon.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Dan's doing a Haunted Mansion mini series.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Yeah, it's called Unstable.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew And there's Haunted Mansion.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew But there's stuff to hold us over until then. Swampy's movie is supposed to be coming out at some point...
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew They said that they'll announce what's going on soon...
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew It very well could be.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew Well, they're working on a pilot right now...
@AcunaAndrew @classy_kyle1 What amazes me is that Swampy has never been to Rubio's. There's a bunch of them in Burbank. (They're AMAZING.)
@AcunaAndrew @classy_kyle1 I don't see why it wouldn't. In fact, that's probably where they'll announce what's happening.
@AcunaAndrew @classy_kyle1 I'm hoping I can meet up with Dan and/or Swampy for fish tacos at Rubio's at some point during Comic Con.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew A lot still do. Which is annoying.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew But the irony is that Last Day of Summer isn't nearly as hyped. Even though it should be more so.
@classy_kyle1 @AcunaAndrew It was about the Act Your Age madness.And here we go again...
@AcunaAndrew @classy_kyle1 Ah.i didn't know that you could do that. Lol
@classy_kyle1 Yeah, probably. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> I got a signed poster for the Star Wars special from both of them.
@AcunaAndrew @classy_kyle1 Wait, I thought Swampy sent you a DM once...
@classy_kyle1 I don't know. He just likes me, I guess. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@classy_kyle1 Yeah, Swampy's followed me for over a year now. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@classy_kyle1 @mmonogram @awalkonwater1 @DanPovenmire It's pretty hard to get Dan to follow anyone... He's not on Twitter nearly as often.
@HeinzKetchup_US Smiley faces forever.
@DrunkAtdisney It's bad?
@ottohadjacent @mmonogram Congrats!
@MissMabelton Don't forget #PhineasAndFerb! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@TrivWorks #TheBestCureForBoredomIs watching Star Wars and its' respective Phineas and Ferb crossover back to back. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@TrivWorks But who's gonna be bored at Comic Con?
@blimey85 The computer I'm looking at is 599. It's touchscreen, has an I5 processor, and it doubles as a tablet.
@blimey85 The most expensive part of Celebration High School is the TV production lab. We've got like 15 Macs and 15 HD cameras.
@blimey85 "You will never, EVER catch a virus on an Apple.""Well, you could still afford a doctor if you bought a PC."
@blimey85 I just don't have that kind of money.
@blimey85 But they're SO EXPENSIVE.
Four minutes until the tech wonderland known as Best Buy opens for the day.
@kelseyyrichards Also, Express Pass!
So, I'm probably on a 700 dollar budget here.
So, not only do I have the 500 dollars for the training video, I also have a tax refund coming in soon. Plus, I've been getting good hours.
Going to Best Buy to look at a new computer and camcorder. Hopefully, this is easier than going to Quest Buy. XD #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil
@MagicCityMayhem I'm hoping Poltergeist.
@DrunkAtdisney No clue, but the last time I heard a Code 3 was during the summer.
@DrunkAtdisney Hell yeah! No injuries at Wet 'N Wild!
@cinemasins 12 dollar toothpaste?!
@bludgeontank88 @mmonogram @k_narrow @itsPlanty And that doesn't make any sense.
@bludgeontank88 @mmonogram @k_narrow @itsPlanty We're not fighting...
Zelena's back, Cruella's dead, and... What the hell is going on?! #OnceUponATime
@RyanRosendal @SeaWorld I know that it's a joke, but it's a really stupid one.
@RyanRosendal @SeaWorld The rollercoaster is definitely NOT powered by Orca blood.
@dparish83 Smartphones are a relatively recent thing.
@dparish83 It shouldn't be a problem as long as people follow the rules.Also, a wallet isn't going to set off the metal detector.
@dparish83 But you have to have some form of ID in the locker for them to let you get your stuff.
@Clare_Overton @SeaWorld And Manta has what is probably the most serene rollercoaster queue EVER.It's gorgeous!
@Clare_Overton @SeaWorld You can barely even hear Manta when they're test running it from the pizza place across from the station.
@dparish83 How can it be easily opened? Is there someone out there with your exact fingerprint?
@dparish83 @AltamonteFamily @SeaWorld @SeaWorldMommy @UniversalORL Just put your phone in the locker. It's free.
@dparish83 @AltamonteFamily @SeaWorld @SeaWorldMommy @UniversalORL If the metal detectors let Dragon Challenge duel again, it's worth it.
@RyanRosendal @SeaWorld You're an idiot.
@GregInORL @JimHillMedia @SeaWorld That's like Aqua Drag Racer. The tallest, fastest, ride of of its kind in Florida isn't saying a lot...
@Clare_Overton @SeaWorld Actually, all of SeaWorld's coasters are very quiet. They fill the tracks with sand to reduce the vibrations.
@dparish83 @AltamonteFamily @SeaWorld @SeaWorldMommy @UniversalORL It's not their fault that people don't read posted signs and warnings.
@AltamonteFamily @SeaWorld @SeaWorldMommy @UniversalORL Judging by where it is, probably not. It won't go over any guest areas.
@KrispySmore @SeaWorld Well, if they're hiring the construction company that @UniversalOrl uses, it'll be done in nine months. XD
@SeaWorld Unfortunately, in 2017, it will loose tallest, and probably longest.Oh well. Still excited! It's a hypercoaster, right?
@itsPlanty @KesetHanduk Someone is getting F-I-R-E-D.
@ChrisCalgher1 @DanPovenmire Well, technically, even if the show IS ending, there's still the OWCA special.
@calpalsfob Act Your Age? That wasn't the last episode. In fact, it hasn't even been confirmed that the show's ending.
@NoPhukingWay NOT the last episode
@MisterAlex NOT the last episode.
@hesthentic We'll know more soon.
@hesthentic I don't think it's over. Rumor has it that after Last Day of Summer and OWCA, there's going to be a Netflix pickup.
@ottohadjacent @mmonogram I could totally see Netflix picking up P&amp;F. Especially since Disney already has a deal with them for Marvel stuff.
@itsPlanty It wasn't supposed to air yet.
@ottohadjacent @mmonogram That rumored Netflix pickup is looking better and better...
@FrasesPyFsp @mmonogram @TurenMaster They're not supposed to spoil anything.
@ottohadjacent @mmonogram I just don't understand why they need to send it to them early at all!
@AcunaAndrew @mmonogram And of course, it's episodes like AYA and the epic Season 4 finale that get leaked...
@mmonogram How does this happen twice in one year? Someone's getting fired.
@mmonogram You know, I feel like @_AlexHirsch would probably kill someone if something got leaked. XD
@mmonogram You think they would've learned from freaking Act Your Age. DON'T GIVE UNAIRED EPISODES TO PUBLIC STATIONS.
@k_narrow @Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan you can be proud of an episode that isn't canon.
@mmonogram Hey, did you see that Last Day of Summer got leaked?
“Yes, one.” 
“How many times have you been nominated?” 
“Eleven.” 
(Laughs)“So you lost 10…
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan And the anti-matter in the Warp core causes everyone to get sent back 24 hours.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan Basically, a collision with another ship causes the Enterprise to explode.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan I think it was called 'Four'.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan Either that, or it's the whole cast, like in that one episode of Next Generation...
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan My guess is it's either Phineas or Isabella who is repeating the day over and over.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan But the fact that we have to avoid spoilers now SUCKS.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan I still say AYA was built to throw people off. And this makes me even more confident.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan Right. Gravity Falls gets the glory, but there's been some pretty crazy stuff on P&amp;F.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan And AYA could easily be a result of one of these 'Last Days of Summer'.
@Moonchirashi @BogheadEX @AcunaAndrew @SharperPnFFan It's like Groundhog Day? So there we go. Earning the patch could easily come into play.
@AcunaAndrew @BogheadEX @TurenMaster @SharperPnFFan Also, aren't there supposed to be other episodes too?
@AcunaAndrew @BogheadEX @TurenMaster @SharperPnFFan We're not supposed to know what's gonna happen.And I still say AYA was a red herring.
@AcunaAndrew @BogheadEX @TurenMaster @SharperPnFFan And what sucks about this is that it's not -Phineas and Isabella obviously get together-
@BogheadEX @SharperPnFFan @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Disney Channel clearly didn't learn from the insanity of AYA.
@SharperPnFFan @DanPovenmire @mmonogram DC brilliantly gave some channel in the Philippines Last Day of Summer. It's AYA all over again.
-Disney Channel gives the episode to Channel 5 in the Philippines. Episode airs early.-@DanPovenmire @mmonogram: what did we JUST SAY?
@DanPovenmire &amp; @mmonogram: Now remember. We don't want this aired other countries until it airs here.Disney Channel: Cool cool
@k_narrow @Leibi97 @hulitherium At least IsabellaFlinnSh isn't here to rub spoilers in our faces...
@hulitherium @k_narrow Unlike AYA, we actually DON'T know how this is gonna end, so yeah... If we could avoid spoilers, that'd be great.
@hulitherium @k_narrow Not gonna watch anything...Not gonna watch anything...Not gonna watch anything...
@hulitherium @alikigreeky Disney seriously needs to STOP giving other countries unaired episodes.
@k_narrow @hulitherium @Leibi97 despite strict instructions NOT TO.
@k_narrow @hulitherium @Leibi97 ...but then they give random international networks copies of the episodes who air it anyways.
@k_narrow @hulitherium @Leibi97 Seriously. Why does Disney let this happen? They're really strict about the crew not saying anything..
@BogheadEX @mdvillalon @AcunaAndrew They've clearly demonstrated that they can't be trusted. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@BogheadEX @mdvillalon @AcunaAndrew Disney needs to stop giving copies of unaired episodes to non-Disney networks in other countries.
@BogheadEX @mdvillalon Great. Here we go again... @AcunaAndrew
@LegitKuzco I love that Freestyle is popping up everywhere. They have it at every @Wawa now!
@LegitKuzco Agreed! And it's a better brand.
@LegitKuzco Coke pretty much has a monopoly on the Orlando theme parks. The only park I can actually think of that sells Pepsi is Fun Spot.
@LegitKuzco Yeah, Coca-Cola products. (They even have a couple of Freestyle machines around the park. Those are the best. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>)
@LegitKuzco Selling souvenir bottles that let you drink all day.
Added to resume: Produced a training video for SeaWorld and Coca-Cola.
@HogwartsLogic The books are better.
@CPlagmann I didn't feel like wasting money on that... I get in Universal for free anyways.
@vasego1 I mean, just look at the Phineas and Ferb crossover!
@OrlandoTourist1 I'm sure the Wawa would be all for that.
@vasego1 Nah, the guys at Disney are bigger Star Wars fans than George Lucas.
GEICO wins commercials. 
@LovelyDDovely Fish Tacos FTW!
The video is done! Hooray!
So, Seaworld is officially building a new coaster. Awesome! #TallestInOrlando #UntilSkyscraperOpensIn2017 @SeaWorldPodcast
@AlvaRaryMercury Yeah, and I'm getting paid for this!
Sorry I've been so quiet lately. I've been working on my first professional video project.

@kaleighbrillon Last episode?
@thrillgeek "You are incredibly misguided."
@ParksByDoom #MeanwhileAtWetNWild"WE WAITED 30 MINUTES FOR DISCO H2O! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!"Me: It could be WAY WORSE.

@DBZNappa Look at the picture at the start of this conversation. XD
@ldoImaster More specifically, Phineas and Isabella's relationship.
@AcunaAndrew @k_narrow Stalker level: OVER 9000.
@congratuIations You know that Riff Raff is Phineas and Ferb's dad, right?
@ella_biebs Doof 101. They weren't the main focus of the episode, but we saw them in school.
@TonZanta @headquarters @DisneyPictures Yes. F**KING DISNEY is definitely in need of music.
Can anyone confirm if the song "Detour Thru Your Mind" by the B-52's is featured somewhere in @PixarInsideOut?
Man, @pollotropical is good...

It's a pretty stormy day. Nevertheless, I'm off to the waterpark.
@WCReaf It's funny though, because the "girly" movies like Tangled and Frozen appeal to everyone. They're just fun movies.
@derekburgan @DrunkAtdisney FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
@itsPlanty Morning!
I want my own BB-8.
@WFTV Not to be confused with the Dragon Challenge program. -rimshot-

@MickBrege BB8 is AWESOME.
@harryghifary Jesus, this is depressing.
@harryghifary EIGHT THOUSAND VIEWS?!?!Meanwhile, I got Swampy to guest star in a P&amp;F tribute and I'm at a thousand. 
@harryghifary @YouTube What the hell?Also, why write a fanfiction about Dipper going to Taco Bell?
@Radio_Actor @AnneWheaton @femfreq This could backfire severely if it goes viral...
@harryghifary @YouTube Does that mean that there was an adult version of this video?
I kinda want to start a roleplay account...
@kaleighbrillon I don't know. Every one of those pesky rules is there to keep guests safe.
@hatetofly @Orlando_United A hyper coaster would be AWESOME!
@HamillHimself @ViolentlyLopez @etrnlaffair Save it from destruction via the Death Star... XD
@DrunkAtdisney I don't know why people always complain about the Three Cabelerros being on that ride. It makes sense!
@xStarVsEvilx Hey!
@kaleighbrillon Yeah, rule number one of going to a theme park: DON'T BE A JERK TO THE TEAM MEMBERS.
.@kaleighbrillon He continues to curse me out and then leaves.
.@kaleighbrillon And at that point, he starts screaming at me. "YOU MEAN WE HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE FOR A F**KING LIGHT?!"
.@kaleighbrillon One of them asks, "Can you see exactly how much we weigh?" "No, but there's a light right here that turns red and beeps-"
.@kaleighbrillon I have the both stand on the scale, all is good, I give them a token and a tube and tell them to start going around.
.@kaleighbrillon He yells to his partner to come down, cursing multiple times. I think: "Oh boy, this is gonna be fun."
.@kaleighbrillon "We weigh the same" he says. "It doesn't matter." I say. "EVERYONE has to get weighed before riding."
.@kaleighbrillon I tell him that for safety reasons, both riders need to be down there to get weighed. He starts being a jerk to me.
.@kaleighbrillon Group of two that went up and didn't realize that they needed a token. One of them comes back down and asks for one.
.@kaleighbrillon To help facilitate this, the conveyor, and keep lines under control, we give you a token after you get weighed.
.@kaleighbrillon At Brain Wash, we have a max weight limit of 700 pounds. As a result, we have to weigh people at the bottom.
@kaleighbrillon I had a fun experience like that at Brain Wash today...
@moviepilotnews @starwars As long as they don't constantly make old person jokes.Then again, I wouldn't want him to die...
@plain_tim @DrunkAtdisney @derekburgan @HackLaSalle LMAO

@roxmic1 @DrunkAtdisney It's the same problem the Star Wars prequels had. Which is why I'm excited that Episode 7 is returning to practical.
@TheHashtagGame @tonyposnanski #DescribeHeavenInFiveWordsStar Wars Episode Seven Trailer
@roxmic1 @DrunkAtdisney Yeah, it's basically just: "HEY LOOK! CGI!"
@CaroKilia Well, everyone seems pretty pumped up about it. Hoping for the best!
@CaroKilia Are you crazy? J.J Abrams is directing! It's gonna be FANTASTIC!
@fanfiction_txt Why the hell would a princess from Norway need to get a job at a crummy pizza place?

That moment when you realize a horrible spelling mistake. 
@hulitherium @AcunaAndrew Honestly, I think they just wanted to make a fun, fanfictioney kind of episode. And they did.
@hulitherium @AcunaAndrew Plus, if it was canon, they would've said so. On Twitter. Directly.
@hulitherium @AcunaAndrew There's too many plotholes that don't mesh with episodes made in very close proximity to AYA.
@hulitherium @AcunaAndrew But honestly, I feel like it's just straight up not canon.

i was expecting at least one of you to apply a certain ridiculous theo…
@hulitherium @AcunaAndrew Well, if there's time travel, it could wind up retconning AYA.
@MEMOBETTA @BradBirdA113 But we already know what Harrison Ford looks like now...
@SuperheroFeed I don't think I could care less about this movie...
I'M TALKIN RAINBOWS!I'M TALKIN PUPPIES! #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil
@LegitKuzco I feel like they'll explore that in an upcoming episode.
@RegalMovies It was Perry the Platypus who stole the plans to the Death Star!
@HogwartsLogic I think Voldemort's death was the biggest thing that they screwed up.
@DrunkAtdisney Maelstrom sucked. But Frozen's not any better.
The ride itself is fine, but the story's lousy. @SeaWorldPodcast
Journey To Atlantis: the story of a CGI mermaid who turns into Amanda Bynes and tries to kill you for literally no reason. @SeaWorldPodcast
@BradBirdA113 The marketing for Star Wars is great because they're showing us a lot of cool stuff without showing us anything.
As it turns out, somehow, I got on the green line... Even though there's no green line stop at SeaWorld
It's not like this is hard. You have two possible routes, and you stop when we pull the cord.
We're supposed to be going down I-Drive and we end up on Sand Lake...
This trolley driver has no idea where the hell she's going.
@AcunaAndrew At the very least, we've got another time travel episode.
It's time for another @AcunaAndrew conspiracy theory!
@MrBrianOrl Catching the trolley back to my car right now. I'm parked at I-Drive 360

@MicahHirsh Whaddya mean?
@LegitKuzco Hmm... Lemme guess...
@LegitKuzco Well, do the classics really need that much promotion?
@Mabel_Pines23 @SrDippingSauce Did you guys turn into Phineas and Ferb? Why are you on the moon? XD
@LegitKuzco Also, I'm pretty excited for Inside Out.
@LegitKuzco Eh. They still are. I mean, look at how well Big Hero 6 and Frozen did.

Obama: joe no-

Biden: an OBAMANATION! [spikes…
@LegitKuzco If there's one thing Disney loves right now, it's complex universe building! #Marvel #StarWars #GravityFalls
@LegitKuzco Hmm... Maybe.
.@starwars Wait, you mean it WASN'T Perry the Platypus?!?! <DISAPPOINTED FACE> @danpovenmire @mmonogram
I was a little kid once too. I know how much not being tall enough for rides sucks. But it's FOR SAFETY REASONS.
Don't try to tell me how to do my job. Especially when I'm reiterating a rule that has been put in place TO KEEP YOUR KID SAFE.
"Thanks for being annoying."Me: I'm sorry that you kid isn't tall enough, but I'm just doing my job."No you're not."
@Eagullfly @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Yeah, but he LITERALLY had more lines.
@rwmead Not to mention, he is trying to screw with film history.
@rwmead You'd think he would actually care about what the fans think, considering he owes EVERYTHING to them.
@rwmead I have the original version on VHS. The problem is, I can't really get that on my computer.
@rwmead Yeah. that's the only problem.
I hate it when I realize that there was some random mistake in a tweet.
@DiegoDrummer69 I bought a special edition that includes the original copy of the movie on Amazon for 17 bucks.
So, to recap, I'm doing an "Extended Edition" of Star Wars that includes P&amp;F Star Wars You're welcome. @danpovenmire @mmonogram
I just bought the Episode IV special edition on Amazon, so I WILL be using the original cut of the movie. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
Forget novelizations... THIS is awesome. @ClassicStarWars 
I was able to convert P&amp;F Star Wars from the DVD to a MP4 on my computer. So, that's a step in the right direction! @danpovenmire @mmonogram
Okay, so anything online like Itunes probably won't work. Looks like I'm gonna have to buy the DVD if I want to do this.
But I guess if that happens, I could just film it on my TV. XD
The only thing I'm worried about with buying Episode IV on Amazon is that I'll run into write protection or something.
@thefinebros You guys need to do YouTubers react to the Star Wars trailer.
@RShipGoalz Uh... What?! XD @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@ENews I want to know if he's seen the Phineas and Ferb Star Wars crossover.
@ENews -George Lucas walks out of seeing Force Awakens-"You've done me proud, J.J. You've done me proud."
@maguay Yeah, C3P0 and R2D2 are amazing.
@kaleighbrillon I love Arnold Palmers.
I just realized that @AllisonBJanney does the safety instructions for Star Tours 2.0.
@Imagineer2017 I just watched Phineas and Ferb Star Wars... Again.It's just perfect on every level. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Imagineer2017 True.
@Imagineer2017 Why are you doing this to yourself?
@RafTheAnxious Go watch the Phineas and Ferb crossover. It'll fix that. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@FrankConniff But really, Disney's letting the fans take over. As opposed to Lucas, who screwed up his own creation.
@ditzkoff It's called: planets have gravity.
Fun Fact: Sith-Inatored Ferb has more lines than Darth Maul. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram #PhineasAndFerb #StarWars
#C3P0
@ottohadjacent I have the original versions on VHS. Although, I think the new HD Digital version is supposed to be the original copy.
@halrudnick Now, I wonder if we'll get any Star Wars Land news... I mean, we already know that it's happening..
@halrudnick Ah.Well, I'm freaking stoked! It's gonna be great.
@Imagineer2017 I don't know, but I want to do a fan edit of A New Hope that splices in the P&amp;F special.
I feel like it would be really fun if we all worked together and did a Star Wars Staffer.I have no idea how the hell we would pull it off.
@DoctoroftheDead @ThisAliceLynch @arnoldtblumberg Star Wars universe Isabella: I HATE YOU ALL.#PhineasAndFerb
@halrudnick Do you have any idea why Nick Mundy is avoiding the trailer?
Trying to think of a clever title for the P&amp;F Star Wars edit... How about "Star Wars: Retold and ReFERBished"? @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@JakeDally I'm personally hoping we get the other two Phineas and Ferb specials. They're not canon, but I don't care. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@JakeDally It'll probably be around two, but there's way more coming. Not just Episodes 8 and 9, but spinoffs and other stuff too!
@thetomska Not necessarily.
@FB_BMB @MicahHirsh These guys sound insane.
@thetomska You don't choose to have a fandom. The fandom chooses to have you. -Jaden Smith
@ThorsBoyfriend Well, they've been on a winning streak recently.
@MicahHirsh Which is crazy, cuz it's already huge.
@MicahHirsh I know. But still, the fanbase is gonna grow EXPONENTIALLY.
And all those people who say that they're not Star Wars fans, (even though they haven't actually watched it) that's gonna change.
@arnoldtblumberg It'll deliver. I trust J.J. He's a great director and a huge Star Wars fan.
@WilliamShatner Well, Star Trek sort of is. Not with the different aliens, but with the physical technology.-sent from my tricorder
We're at a point where people are gonna look forward to Star Wars movies just like they do Marvel movies. And it's AWESOME.
Hey @arnoldtblumberg, what did you think of the new Star Wars trailer?
@moutzie89 Gluten is just wheat flour.
.@Attractions We had to do that at Surge the other day. They tried to cross the landing pool and got sucked into the current.

@rwmead @hulitherium #FloatingTimeline #TheSimpsons #PhineasAndFerb
@hulitherium The only problem is that they'd be like 40 years old by then.
And, none of this is canon, so just relax.
I've gotta be to work at 8:00, so I can't watch the whole thing.
#NowWatching Phineas and Ferb Star Wars
@hulitherium Yes.
@mckinley_mike I love Data. Brent Spiner is amazing. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mckinley_mike Most of these sound more like stuff Data would say.
@SuperheroFeed #TeamSkywalker
@jessleber Screw that. I would leave immediately.
@tonygoldmark Hey, random side note: wha'd you think of the Star Wars trailer?
@LegitKuzco @tonygoldmark Trolls do all sorts of stupid stuff.
@SuperheroFeed I just... It's the same shit we've seen before. It's DC being dark, gritty and overly serious because that's all they know.
@SuperheroFeed I can't see anything. It's too dark and gritty.
@SuperheroFeed But that's not Superman's character. He should've tried to get the fight away from Metropolis!
@LastManFOX Is it cancelled?
@LegitKuzco Right.And yet somehow, they can air commercials for everything else.
@LegitKuzco No, it's not Disney. It's a law.
@LegitKuzco You can only have so many commercials.
@LegitKuzco That's actually something that I would eventually want to do.
@LegitKuzco Unfortunately, due to stupid legal reasons involving kids networks, there could never be a Disney World episode.
@LegitKuzco Yeah, those are allowed. People do stuff like that all the time.
@LegitKuzco And the rest is history.
@LegitKuzco Swampy had followed me, so I sent him a DM and asked if he wanted to play Monogram in the sequel. He said that he would love to.
@LegitKuzco @_AlexHirsch SO MANY MYSTERIES.
@LegitKuzco It did well, and I had fun doing it, so I wrote a sequel that would coincide with our school's annual Storm 101 carnival.
@LegitKuzco I proved him wrong. The first one aired in December, and it did really well. My school, the fandom and Swampy liked it.
.@LegitKuzco So, the story behind this, @ThatSleazyKid told me that I wouldn't be able to pull off a P&amp;F Staffer.
@LegitKuzco Right.
@LegitKuzco She was too good. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@LegitKuzco Mekayla and Mrs. Carpenter did a great job as Candace and Linda, respectively. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco lol
@LegitKuzco What do you mean? XD
@LegitKuzco @tonygoldmark Eh, let Disney Channel be stupid.
@LegitKuzco Eh. If they came after me, (which they're not going to) Swampy would testify for me. XD
@LegitKuzco But there's nothing copyright infringing about this. It's an original story.
@LegitKuzco They're not going to take down a video that one of the co-creators of the show AGREED to star in. XD
@LegitKuzco Uh... No. It's a parody. Parody is protected by copyright law. Also, @mmonogram did a cameo in this one.
@LegitKuzco Isn't Disney Channel doing Adventures in Babysitting?
@LegitKuzco @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Bahahahaha
@LegitKuzco Yeah, he actually wasn't a massive Star Trek fan, but he and his team still did a great job with it!
@LegitKuzco Everyone that's making the new movies grew up watching the original trilogy. Which is awesome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco That's what's exciting about the new Star Wars movies. J.J Abrams is a fantastic director, and a HUGE Star Wars fan.
@LegitKuzco Nah, they did it strictly for the love of Star Wars. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@LegitKuzco Yeah, the Phineas and Ferb crossover was a love letter to Star Wars, and it was brilliant. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco No, they just want to sell stupid merchandise to little kids. Which is kinda pointless when you have STAR WARS and MARVEL...
@LegitKuzco I'll just go watch Phineas and Ferb Star Wars again.
@MickeyXtreme @tomorrowland @WaltDisneyWorld Why couldn't they do it AT Tomorrowland? XD
Also, Space Mountain opened @DisneylandToday, a few weeks after @StarWars.No idea what the exact opening date of Wet 'N Wild was...
@MicahHirsh @Disney Hooray!
@MicahHirsh @Disney @Attractions -Meanwhile, at Lucasfilm and Marvel-"PREPARE THE BANKS! THE BOX OFFICE MONEY IS COMING!"
@MicahHirsh @Disney @Attractions Yup.
@Disney Once Upon A Time Jr.
@LastManFOX @kristenschaaled I think Mabel and Carol are tied for me. I also love Trixie. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
We actually pay homage to @starwars on Black Hole! The launch loop on the TV features the cantina music! No idea if that was intentional.
Fun Fact: @WetnWildOrlando opened the same year that @starwars hit theaters and changed moviemaking forever. @Attractions
It'd take a while, but it would be WORTH IT. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
Now that the original Star Wars trilogy is coming out on digital, I might be able to cut P&amp;F Star Wars together with the original movie...
@UFOParanormNews I resent that. It's not shameless. Dan and Swampy are huge Star Wars fans, and they wanted to do it
@SuperheroFeed I am so NOT EXCITED for this movie.
@fairmegwyn OF THEM ALL.
@fairmegwyn She's the most badass Disney Princess if them all. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@RickEadesComics Like, Gravity Falls weird, or weirder?
@deaconblade Right!The only two DC movies I'm excited for right now are Suicide Squad and Lego Batman.DARKNESS!!!!!!NO PARENTS!!!!
@AnneWheaton GET OUT.Seriously though, it's gonna be awesome!
@deaconblade Daredevil: Dark and gritty, but still fun!
@JimSterling Even Daredevil, Marvel's darkest entry to date, still manages to be really fun!DC... Just... Ugh...
@JulianJabbar Yeah, Batman Vs Superman is probably gonna be a downer.THAT STAR WARS TRAILER THO.
@tomkeene @dbeffert @starwars So far... But from the looks of it, Force Awakens could be even better!
@jonallendc That's AWESOME. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@dickfundy Why not?
@Telegraph @MartinDaubney Yeah, but it's gonna be an AWESOME movie!
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh (We're the original waterpark, by the way. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>)
@PWT101 LMAO.
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh It was 1977! The same year that Wet 'N Wild Orlando opened!
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh Not just the movies, but stuff like Rebels and the Phineas and Ferb crossover. Made by fans, for fans.
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh What's exciting about the new Star Wars stuff is that the people who are making them are massive fans themselves!
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh I was also a huge fan of Star Tours @DisneylandToday. (And still am! That ride is AWESOME!)
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh I was probably 7 when I first watched, and really appreciated Star Wars.
@LookoutsGirl A tragic day. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@HogwartsLogic Give it to the CDC anonymously.
@JustinJamesDJ @UUOPodcast Yeah, Mummy is way short.
@UUOPodcast Everest wins as a coaster, and would win for theming if it wasn't for that little detail...
@TheOnlyZiko Who, in turn, are making the new ones. (And the new ones should be fantastic now that Lucas is out of the picture.)
@TheOnlyZiko Another thing that's great about Star Wars is that it inspired a whole new generation of filmmakers!
@TheOnlyZiko You can like more than one movie franchise. <WINKING FACE>I'm a pretty big Harry Potter fan too. I also love Star Trek.
@susanlee180 @MouldyOldDoh Episode 3 is actually pretty good. The other two... Meh.
@BernardKeane That's not CGI. HE'S ACTUALLY SMILING! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@TheOnlyZiko No way. Not only is the original trilogy a great series of movies, they pretty much changed moviemaking!
@1Lcampesino Disney XD. Because while Disney Channel is still on a downward spiral, Disney XD is actually getting better.
@FB_BMB @thecinemasnob Everyone's seeing Furious 7, or waiting to see Age of Ultron. Movies are too expensive.
@MouldyOldDoh @susanlee180 Empire Strikes back, especially.
@MouldyOldDoh @susanlee180 The original trilogy is fantastic! They're just really fun movies!
@MouldyOldDoh @susanlee180 Why would you be proud of that??
I'm gonna guess that the line for Star Tours @DisneylandToday was very short yesterday. <WINKING FACE> #StarWarsCelebration
@susanlee180 They just dropped a new trailer for the new movie, and it looks AMAZING!
@DraxezVos In the meantime, I've got this whole trilogy I'm working on that's kind of a four way crossover.If I can get it done.
@migue_velasco Yeah, the show's definitely more of a drama, but the haunted house was still FANTASTIC.
@DraxezVos The only problem... I can't draw to save my life. So, I'd have to hire someone else.
@DraxezVos With the Disney World one, my biggest problem for doing it live action would be getting kids who can act AND have passes.
@DraxezVos No, it'd pretty much have to be animated. Too much insanity would go into making it live action.
@DraxezVos Well, with Star Wars, It'd have to be a mini series. The only problem would be getting all of the sets.
@DraxezVos I'll do it as a live action short. Right after I do a Disney World vacation episode of P&amp;F. #WishfulThinking
@migue_velasco It feels like you've pretty much stepped into a horror movie.Or TV show. #WalkingDead
@migue_velasco One word. Avengers.
@migue_velasco Halloween Horror Nights is amazing. The haunted houses are so incredibly detailed, and the makeup effects are fantastic.
@migue_velasco They also did a Spiderman and Jessie semi crossover.Who the hell approved that, I have NO CLUE.
@migue_velasco They actually did a haunted house based on AVP at Halloween Horror Nights last year. It was AWESOME!
@migue_velasco Alien Vs. Predator.But that was more bad acting. The pairing itself works.
@MissMabelton I think the last hashtag I used was #WawaDay.Either that, or #StarWars
@migue_velasco Wait, do I know, or do I want to know? I know there are some pretty bad ones out there.
@migue_velasco Sure.
@thedeebear "Chewie. We're home."
@MissMabelton #Hashtaggery
.@abandonedpics And then we were both killed by a serial killer. #AmericanHorrorStoryMcDonalds
@migue_velasco Dan and Swampy are both HUGE Star Wars fans, and they did a fantastic job.
@migue_velasco It was just for fun, it was very respectful of the original, (everything happens the way it always did) and it's not canon.
@DanPovenmire @mmonogram And I still have made zero progress on getting #TheDanvilleHighSchoolChronicles done.I need to fix that. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
#TBT Holy crap, it's been almost a year since Phineas and Ferb: Carnival Crew came out! 
@Park_Journey @SW_Celebration I know it's not canon, but that won't stop me from making references to it.
@Park_Journey @SW_Celebration Isabella Garcia Shapiro planning to kill Han Solo.
@Michael_Aiello I watched Episode IV on VHS today.Now where the heck is my copy of Phineas and Ferb Star Wars?
@DraxezVos Or something unofficial of that nature.
@DraxezVos If they don't ever wind up getting to do Empire and Jedi, these would be pretty fun to do as an online miniseries.
@DraxezVos I hadn't even thought of potentially including Gravity Falls characters in the other two, but that could work!
@GoAwayGreen (By the way, that was kind of a vague reference to this.) 
@DoctorHu Yeah, that would be pretty fun. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram
@Amphabio "And, none of this is canon, so just relax."Although, it easily could be.
@migue_velasco The Star Wars crossover was AMAZING.
@_mckayla_barrow Also, after watching Episode IV, I would highly recommend watching the Phineas and Ferb crossover. Pure genius. XD
@_mckayla_barrow Totally! They're just really fun movies!Episode V, especially.
@hollyamos22 Woohoo!It'll be sad that @TheRealNimoy won't be in it. <POUTING FACE>
@GoAwayGreen -Meanwhile at Tatooine Elementary, Phineas and Ferb are planning the school's carnival-
@_mckayla_barrow FIX THAT.
@lucasvannes34 You JUST HEARD?
@jaclynkunkle That's what'll be beautiful about these new movies. You'll be able to have never seen Star Wars before, and still love it.
"Who is she? She's beautiful!"DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD, SHE'S YOUR SISTER.
@stitchkingdom @jeremiahgood @imagineeringdis Yeah, that's what I was thinking. You can do some pretty amazing things with electromagnets.

@TVsAndyDaly ECSTATIC!!!
@TobyBramwell True. Number one's main purpose was to look cool. Nothing wrong with that.
@JillPantozzi The teaser trailers are saying "yeah, this is gonna kick ass."
@TobyBramwell And that's saying something, because the first one was pretty freaking cool.
.@FO_ScottKacsmar It's J.J Abrams and his whole team of Star Wars nuts. This movie is going to kick ass and take names.

@kaleighbrillon IT'S SO GOOD THOUGH. The fight sequences, the writing, the score...And the Avengers references. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@kaleighbrillon Meanwhile, on Marvel's Daredevil...
@Park_Journey So... They're Ducks?
@Sherman_Alexie And what's great is that it's dark, but it's still got the witty Marvel charm to it. It's still fun to watch.

Daredevil drinking game: take a shot every time Fisk says this city
@APollard36 It's not yet.
We now have all the terrifying dead eyed novelty ice creams in the canteen. Spiderman looks SO CREEPY.
@DrunkAtdisney @derekburgan @DutchLombrowski @YesThatBrian Yeah, what's the point if you can't do anything?
@DrunkAtdisney @wdwbusdriver get some slurpee machines (like Wild Tiki Lounge) and the assorted alcohol you need, and boom. Monorail bar.
Wet 'N Wild is owned by Comcast...So why do we have DirecTV?
The directors of comic book movies should be allowed to put their own spin on it. That's what keeps it fresh.
Edward: -Complains about the movies changing things from the comics-Me: Why do you want things to be exactly the same?
@MattsEdward @HogwartsLogic Don't you mean SORCERER'S STONE?!-gets shot for being a stupid American-
@HogwartsLogic Man, Harry and Ginny must be feeling old.
@hulitherium Unfortunately.
@WFTV That bear was later found to be Sarah Palin. #Zing
@jsart1978 @IGN Nah, Phineas is the only one that actually works.And the crossover wasn't canon anyways.
@Malsmuse Still waiting for Disney to green light the other two specials...
@TheJennTracker It's just about as expensive as the Hotel Del Coronado. 
@exploitedgeek Well, seeing how well Daredevil is doing, and with the Deadpool hype, there's definitely a market for it!
"@dCTb_: Would watch a supercut of all the times Daredevil throws something at someone's head" Hey @screenjunkies! Get on this! @halrudnick
@Haisai_DBarenzu I just need Disney to greenlight the other two Phineas and Ferb Star Wars specials.
@Haisai_DBarenzu Everybody wins! Disney, Marvel and Lucasfilm make loads of money, and we get tons of geeky amazingness! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@HipHoptoSports Honestly, DC is doing better with TV than they are with movies right now.
@Haisai_DBarenzu I love how the show is extremely dark, but it's still fun.It makes me that much more excited for Deadpool.
@Haisai_DBarenzu @_AlexHirsch is a madman. And a total genius. XD
@Haisai_DBarenzu But what Disney really brings more than anything is the money that Marvel and Lucasfilm need to make amazing movies.
@Haisai_DBarenzu (Although, I think Gravity Falls is actually darker. XD)
@Haisai_DBarenzu Right! Disney's not going to 'tone down' anything!Even Rebels is pretty dark!
Side note: 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's playfully dark, and funny as hell.
Honestly, Star Wars is pretty kid friendly compared to some of the other things that Disney has produced. Roger Rabbit comes to mind.
@exploitedgeek Fox is already doing an R-Rated Deadpool!
@HipHoptoSports Don't forget that Daredevil is TV-MA!
For all the people worried about Star Wars, remember that Disney makes all of the Marvel Studios stuff.INCLUDING THE TV-MA DAREDEVIL.
Fox: Eh, I guess Deadpool kinda has to be R.Marvel: Hell yeah, we're making Daredevil TV-MA!
@APollard36 Have you seen Big Hero 6 yet?
@DaleCurran92 Somewhere else in the city. Not in Hell's Kitchen.
@AcunaAndrew @BogheadEX @JerseyCentralPF I've seen mixed reviews.
Phil is even more of a douchebag than usual... #LastManOnEarth
@BogheadEX @JerseyCentralPF Their brains have turned to putty.SILLY PUTTY.
@NOCHILLSHAHRAM Don't watch either. I'd much rather go see Furious 7.
@JerseyCentralPF It's sad, really. SpongeBob was once a great show.
The Spongebob Movie: Our Writing hit Rock Bottom. #UnpopularAnimatedMovies
@DrunkAtdisney Yeah, if you mess with the volume, the audio quality goes to hell.
@DrunkAtdisney I was like: "How did you know that?" then I remembered the post it note.
Directing announcements. 
@dickfundy I still like Agents of SHIELD, but... Yeah, THIS is what a Marvel TV show SHOULD be like.

Giant orange: THIS IS BULLSHIT!
*flips desk over a…
@SrDippingSauce @Mabel_Pines23 Wait a minute, how'd you wind up in space?
I feel like Cowfish would be a big hit in San Fransokyo. #BigHero6 @CowfishClt @CowfishOrlando
Gonna go home, eat dinner, and watch @daredevil.
@SheaSerrano But he fights crime and kicks ass!
Seriously, Marvel is in a golden age of pure awesomeness right now. Both movies and TV.
Daredevil is dark, but it's still fun.
The biggest thing with DC is that they need to master being dark while also being fun.
Everyone's freaking out about Deadpool being rated R, but Daredevil is TV-MA. Because insanely violent fight scenes.
That's the number one thing we have to watch out for on Aqua Drag. We can dispatch pretty quickly, but little kids take longer to get out.
I laughed and told him that I was calling the top to tell her that I hadn't signaled yet, and that he was okay.
I call top to remind her. As I'm doing this, the kid comes up to me."Are you calling the police on me?"
Of course, the guard at the top thought the track was clear and sent the next group. Luckily, the kid did NOT get run over.
So, yesterday, we had a kid who was probably about five years old on Aqua Drag Racer try to go back up the slide. Dad runs to go get him.
@HogwartsLogic Neither of them were really nerds...
@Sweetstuff78 Don't you mean...NORSE ride in history? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAH!
@doIewhip I just think it's stupid that they're rushing it. They're not taking the time and effort needed to do it right.
-Searches up Jaws ride--people still complaining--Searches up Maelstrom--Nobody gives a crap.
@eawhaaa As much as I loved Jaws, Diagon Alley was totally worth it.
@bioreconstruct @SKYPLEXOrlando -Cue the I-Drive purists complaining about getting rid of such an amazing restaurant- #BringBackJaws2K12
@bioreconstruct @SKYPLEXOrlando R.I.P. Popeye's I-Drive.

[Neighbor to mom] hi Susan!

*kid faints*
@arnoldtblumberg @IcyJohnson I just started watching it, and it's FANTASTIC.
They need to get whoever choreographs the fight scenes for Daredevil to do the Deadpool movie. Because OH MY GOD.
@burnettski92 I noticed that.Oh well. The show kicks ass!
@_Gerrad I wonder if Daredevil will ever show up on SHIELD's radar...Then again, they've been pretty busy lately. Taking out HYDRA and all
.@WFTV -Five minutes later-"WE'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF SLURPEES!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
@Sir_Mapleleaf You still up?
@_Gerrad Don't do what the lousy movie failed at.
So, Daredevil is pretty amazing.

@readingrainbow I'll be reading from the break room of this awesome place. #WetNWild 
In adorable news, a group of ducklings that had to be rescued in surge are now in the Wake Zone lake. THEY'RE SO CUTE!
@CloydRivers -crashes into said girl two minutes later. Both are killed. #Merica
Wakezone signage is gone. The logos, the safety information, everything. It's dead. @Attractions
@OrlandoInformer Same over here! #WetNWild
@MorphanScout Even @jk_rowling will agree that guest safety is the number one priority.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling It could be. Like I said, find a way to dress it up a little more, and make it look like it belongs there.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling Maybe they could do wristbands, like they did for Diagon during HHN.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling Do you know how many stupid people I see trying to take pictures and videos on the ride? A lot.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling Because even if they're NOT dueling, a camera could still hit someone in line.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling Well, if it's for safety reasons, she can't really do anything. Notice Hulk and Rockit have them too.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling Well, it's not like they're extremely complicated anyways. People walk through, if they beep, they need to go back
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling All they really need to do is dress them up and call them Ministry security checkpoints.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling But I'm sure they've all been trained correctly on it. Also, they have metal detectors at HHN.
@spanieldaniel98 On days when we DID close, I usually went to Universal or SeaWorld. We get in free there.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling That's actually why they stopped dueling. Hopefully, if this works, they can duel again.
@MorphanScout @jk_rowling It's for safety reasons. People try to bring stuff they're not supposed to on Dragon Challenge.
@punyparker It's because people are stupid, and they try to bring stuff they're not supposed to on the rollercoasters.
@PureCoaster Who is going to be mad about this? It's a safety thing! And could get Dragon Challenge to duel again.
@mounce07 The metal detectors are to make sure that people aren't bringing cell phones and cameras on the rollercoasters.
@mounce07 The suicide at Universal Hollywood is completely unrelated to the metal detectors at the rollercoasters.
@disn3ydude @SeeShannonTweet Who is outraged about this?
@spanieldaniel98 "Aren't we supposed to have at least 50 people in the park to stay open?"
@spanieldaniel98 You think that feels like cheating, try working at Wet 'N Wild during January...
I was trying to find a crossover picture that didn't have Isabella, but I think everyone agrees her and Mabel would be best friends.
@DrDoofEvil If I had a nickel for every time I was spammed by a bot account...

In honor of National Siblings Day, I bring you this awesome picture, which is not mine. #GravityFalls #PhineasAndFerb

@syxhirah Sounds like fun!
@PhunPhactory And people say Disney isn't dark...
Manny's pizza bow has Meat Lover's pizza, and it's delicious! @WetnWildOrlando @Attractions
@blimey85 Well, I'm sure taking the frying out will help.
I'm gonna start working on cutting down on fried food... Grilled chicken sandwich instead of fried. It was still really good.
@disney_images One day isn't enough!(Side note: you should come visit us at Wet 'N Wild! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>)
@SeaWorldTyler "I stand with PETA because they killed over 25,000 puppies."Idiots.
@disney_images @UniversalORL Rockit... The list goes on.
@disney_images @UniversalORL They'll still be bad. XDYeah, Wizarding World is amazing, as is Transformers, Despicable Me, Springfield,
@UniversalORL @disney_images So much has changed. The park is even more amazing than you remember!

That moment when your dad complains about a Slurpee being unhealthy... On a night when dinner is @tacobell.
So, start sending in submissions, CHS! #CHSStormSelfie
It all depends on how many submissions we get.
So, I don't know if the selfie thing is going to be it's own segment on Stormwatch, or if we'll find a way to sprinkle them throughout.
@syxhirah Their tacos are really good too.
@syxhirah And their burritos... Mmmm...I also love Moe's. Their Queso is AMAZING.
@SuperheroFeed It's not the actors fault when the movie sucks. Hell, look at Catwoman.
@syxhirah I used to go to the Valencia campus out by Universal, and there's a Chipotle that pretty much EVERYONE goes to. (Delicious!)
@Forensic_Lady22 @foxandfriends Well, she's still a person, and it's still sad.
@honestfandom But... One Direction!
@cinemasins A) because I love the show, and B) because Disney needs to start doing hand drawn animation on the big screen again.
@cinemasins "Disney finally announces Phineas and Ferb theatrical movie."
So, I did FINALLY talk to my guidance counselor and get an FLVS history class set up.
@PnF_Fan19 Yep. It's Spring Break.
@AcunaAndrew @Funist10 @PnF_Fan19 I still say spinoff. I mean, we know that Dan and Swampy are working on a new show for Disney.
@Funist10 @PnF_Fan19 @AcunaAndrew Not overly fond of DirecTV. Bad customer service, and they jack your rates up after the first year.
@PnF_Fan19 Good! Extremely busy, as expected.
@AcunaAndrew It was an incredibly dumbass decision.
@PnF_Fan19 I'm here! (I've been at work all day.)
@lloydrang They do that stuff in their spare time. It just makes really boring television. @DanPovenmire @mmonogram

@Kevin_Oohh Agreed.
@UniversalORL YES. THAT PLACE IS AWESOME.
@abandonedpics They used this in an Alex Cross movie.
@Kevin_Oohh I think Lady Gaga is a pretty fitting replacement for Jessica Lange.Granted, you can't fully replace her. She was AMAZING.
@hustler4life_ @DisneylandToday Yep! Nothing like drinking a slushie out of a snowman!Wait.
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu That's one of the things that makes Into the Woods really fun.
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu (Side note: I think it was stupid that they completely ditched the narrator's interaction with the characters.)
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu Granted, both of those were adaptations.
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu But Disney XD has some fantastic cartoons on it! (There's also a lot of garbage.)
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu And Disney does make some good live action movies. Alexander was really fun, and Into the Woods was good.
@SeaWorldTyler @SeaWorld They had this awesome ride vehicle, and they didn't do anything overly memorable with it.
@SeaWorldTyler @SeaWorld Better dark rides. Antarctica was disappointing.
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu After all, isn't animation kind of what Disney's known for?
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu Or, spend this money on MORE ANIMATED MOVIES.
@APollard36 @Haisai_DBarenzu I'm excited for Mulan, and Beauty and the Beast has some amazing casting, but that's about it.
@DigiRanger1994 @Haisai_DBarenzu @APollard36 Apparently Zelena's back? What the hell?
@DigiRanger1994 @Haisai_DBarenzu @APollard36 Yeah, and there's more to be uncovered.I gotta get caught back up.
@Haisai_DBarenzu @APollard36 But why do live action remakes of classics when there are a ton of fairy tales that Disney hasn't done yet?
@Haisai_DBarenzu I just don't understand why we need all of these when we have Once Upon a Time.
@AcunaAndrew @PnF_Fan19 Yeah, pretty much all of the fanfics on the Star archive are Starco. XD

@JayInFlorida @WDWNT @Attractions I think they blocked me because I was complaining about Frozen. XD
@StingrayTom3000 @Attractions They'll probably do that at next year's Bill and Ted's. XD

@BillCiDemonGuy No, they're just PETA dumbasses.
@rwmead I'd be all in for it. The musical's better than the movie!
@rwmead -this has been my random thought of the day, partially as a result of Into the Woods-

@SharperPnFFan Nope. I didn't have a date, so it was basically me and my friends hanging out.
@DrunkAtdisney Thankfully, it sounds like there were no incidents near Disney last night. Everyone made it home safe and sound! #CHSProm2015

@themeparkdev We actually had Prom at Epcot last night. Walking through the park, we confused the hell out of all the tourists. XD
@themeparkdev I have a Hogwarts Express T-shirt somewhere...

@Manjesus17 @kaleighbrillon I watch ABC, FOX, AMC, NBC, occasionally Cartoon Network, and Disney XD. Disney Channel is pretty much worthless
@DrDoofEvil *posts?
@DrDoofEvil Why do you just keep randomly tagging me in postsn
Last Man on Earth: Phil is still kind of an asshole. STOP TRYING TO GET WITH MELISSA. IT'S NEVER HAPPENING.
@Manjesus17 @kaleighbrillon I only watch the channels that have the shows I like.
@DigiRanger1994 DON'T GET ME STARTED. #PhineasAndFerb
@Manjesus17 @kaleighbrillon Disney XD and Nick have AWFUL commercials.
Why the hell would I watch this? #WaywardPines 

@hulitherium I hate the Annie remake because if you say that it's stupid, people call you a racist.
@hulitherium I want to go see it because it looks cute.
@sonicfan420 I don't think there's a good side.
@KingTopTitty @UniStudios Oh, yeah.
@KingTopTitty @UniStudios severity team?
@Park_Journey In other news, my Prom is tomorrow!Fun Fact: The CHS Prom is the only Prom in the world to be hosted at Epcot.
@syxhirah Someone committed suicide using a gun.
@Park_Journey I'm way more excited than I should be for that movie.
My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who was at @UniStudios today. Especially the team members.
@Park_Journey Rockit broke down and the daughter of that one chick who helped stop the Sharknado got stuck!Oh wait. #Sharknado3
@Attractions @Variety PLEASE! WE NEED THIS IN OUR LIVES!
@USHToday Well, what else are they supposed to do?
@Park_Journey @KTLA The fact that two dry rotted 2004 tires were able to pass a safety inspection is another story.
@Park_Journey @KTLA I ROLLED OVER A NAIL BY ANIMAL KINGDOM! IT'S DISNEY'S FAULT!
@Park_Journey @KTLA Everyone freaked out a week ago when Hulk broke down.Rides break down, guys.
@hatetofly @bioreconstruct @CaptMichael87 @theorlandoeye I'm still curious as to how they'll get people to the top of the volcano.
@HannahLouuuise I DID THE EXACT SAME THING. (Only, I was like 14, and we did stupid Jackass style videos.)
@voxdotcom So, she's being punished for a miscarriage that she was in no way responsible for?
@DNAvidWood @halrudnick We were just randomly watching that movie, and... HOLY CRAP, IT'S HAL RUDNICK!
@TheJosephGamboa Yeah... Good lord...

@PipersPicksTV @mmonogram @NASCAR @awalkonwater1 I'll definitely still donate, though...Once I have money.
@JamboEveryone MY BODY IS READY. WHERE IS THIS MAGIC?
@PipersPicksTV @mmonogram @NASCAR @awalkonwater1 Too bad I won't be in California until this summer...During Comic Con. (Sadly not going.)
@USHToday Part of the problem with USH is that the parking garage is UNDER part of the park.
@JamboEveryone WOW.
@rwmead There's a whole Wikipedia page about it.
@rwmead Yeah, I saw that.
@michaeljnelson @BillCorbett @kwmurphy I wonder if you guys could find a way to do that on @RiffTrax... Maybe an audiobook type thing?
Someone wrote a fanfic where Mike, Servo and Crow read terrible fanfics, and it's FANTASTIC. #MST3K @michaeljnelson @BillCorbett @kwmurphy
@akapakii That was probably half of the budget for Prom.
@6stringbailey "I died because I partied too hard." -Bailey Blankenship #PromPromise #SexDrugsRockAndRoll
And that, ladies and gentlemen, was half of our Prom budget.
Oh my God, THE FEELS. #PromPromise
Man, they're really going all out with this. #PromPromise 
@Attractions I might tomorrow. #CHSProm2015
@verawank @DisneylandToday
I need to get a tux for Prom. ASAP.
WALT DISNEY IS ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE. SLEEPING BEAUTY, CINDERELLA, DUMBO AND POOH DO NOT NEED LIVE ACTION REMAKES.
@rwmead Seriously... Where the hell is that Phineas and Ferb movie? I'm fairly certain @danpovenmire and @mmonogram still want to make it!
DISNEY. STOP MAKING LIVE ACTION REMAKES.WE DON'T WANT THEM.
@uncomfroterrify The brownie took a vacation.
@rwmead NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS.

@z_nadeem98 I'm also a pretty big fan of the Butterbeer Ice Cream at Florean's over at Diagon Alley.
@WaymoTheGod I guess they realized that making it PG-13 was impossible.
@WaymoTheGod 
Heading into work at fabulous Wet 'N Wild Orlando!

@quacketeer I'M EIGHTEEN. I should be allowed to have a little privacy!
@quacketeer "You're not supposed to lock your door"Well then why the hell does my door HAVE a lock?
@tonygoldmark Whenever people say "water shortage", my first thought is:  "THERE IS A HUGE OCEAN."
@WaymoTheGod But it's NOT PG-13.
@k_narrow @harleylynchr5 Again, they've never said that it's canon.But whatever.
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew But they've said before that they don't know.And if it was officially ending, they would've told us.
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew The only ones I can find are in response to people who are saying that AYA is the finale.
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew They've said it quite a few times.
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew Well, the other question is, why would they keep saying that it's not over if it is?
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew But who knows?
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew The spinoff could be completely different, but with the same cast.
@Sir_Mapleleaf @AcunaAndrew Well, Dan and Swampy are working on a pilot for Disney as we speak. What else would it be?
@SuperheroFeed I'm excited! This should be really fun!
@harleylynchr5 Night of the Living Pharmacists is AMAZING.And also creates a few plotholes for Act Your Age. #Phinabella
@harleylynchr5 There was also the Emmy Award Nominated 'Save Summer', which was great. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@harleylynchr5 Simpsons has done a ton of those, so why is it so hard to believe that Phineas and Ferb can do that?
@harleylynchr5 They've been making new episodes. They just did a Star Wars crossover and a Night of the Living Dead spoof.
@harleylynchr5 I still don't think it's canon. I think it's more of a "what if?" kind of episode than anything.
@Funist10 @AcunaAndrew No thanks.
Hey guys, Gravity Falls has officially been renewed for Season 3! 
@AcunaAndrew @StarButterfly_ DUDE. WHAT IS TODAY?
@StarButterfly_ Renewed for Season 3!
@Sir_Mapleleaf I definitely think a spinoff is likely.
@Eagullfly @uncomfroterrify What's today?
@uncomfroterrify Damn you.
So, no cavities or nothing crazy. I just need to work on my gums.
What's funny is that I still go to a pediatric dentist, but I can drive myself there.
Some lame movie my Grandma's watching, and OH MY GOD, THAT'S ZACK AND CODY'S MOM! 
Hey @_AlexHirsch, remember last year when you announced that there was going to be a Gravity Falls/Phineas crossover?Still not over that.
@Disney @Disneyland @WaltDisneyWorld And yet you still don't have a Phineas and Ferb ride. What the heck, guys? @disneylandtoday
@Moes_HQ There's actually a Moe's directly above the @Cinnabon at Citywalk in Orlando.
@FafaGroundhog @EdwardSlater90 @gloveandboots @MarioGlove This sounds like a very hipster thing.
@DrunkAtdisney Also, I like the April Fools Day joke. @derekburgan
@DrunkAtdisney @derekburgan That's why you don't go drinking around the world before getting shot into space. XD
@derekburgan It's fun! Not for the weak of stomach, I grant you, but it's a pretty cool ride!
@derekburgan Am I the only person who actually likes Mission Space?
@TDelovely How is that not discrimination?
@TDelovely If I own a chicken restaurant, and a gay couple comes up to me and orders lunch, and I say no because they're gay...
@TDelovely There's a difference between being forced to participate in something and providing a good or service to someone.
@TDelovely I don't know, I just feel like it's a bad idea.But there are worse problems out there, so...
@TDelovely The wedding cake example is pretty much the only one where this law makes sense.
@TDelovely My problem is that this can be twisted and misused really easily.
@frenchyballs BUY CANDY!GET DIABEETUS!

@redrobinburgers I got the burnin' love burger. It was delicious!
I love the burger chairs. @redrobinburgers 
@anakbeltran I wonder if that's why there's tension between Star Wars and Star Trek fans.Personally, I love both.
@anakbeltran Shatner's actually responded to me a couple of times.He also fights with Carrie Fisher. Frequently. XD
@anakbeltran Twitter. The only place (outside Comic Con) where common folk like us can talk to Luke Skywalker and Captain Kirk. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@rwmead Ah...
@anakbeltran OH MY GOD, @HamillHimself just responded to you. @CW_TheFlash
.@HamillHimself @zignagspeaks Have you seen the Phineas and Ferb Star Wars special?
@zombietardis Awesome! Although, I'm amazed they nominated Save Summer over Star Wars.Still the best hour of television ever. XD
@WorldUniversalR The Hogwarts Express!
@redrobinburgers Evidently they don't do the balloons anymore. Also, this place got a new look! I love it! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Finally going to @redrobinburgers to redeem my free birthday burger. (And maybe get a balloon too. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>)
@Chodecka @kennytorrella @cocoloony @Lochina186 @dougducey That said, I like the idea of being able to "grow" meat using stem cells.
@Chodecka @kennytorrella @cocoloony @Lochina186 @dougducey Nah, @CowfishOrlando is too good for it to all be in my head.
@xStarVsEvilx @StacysSisterFSG Ludo's kind of an idiot. XD
@THEWlNTER She needs to at least have a cameo somewhere. Sorta like how the original Valjean was in the Les Mis movie.
@THEWlNTER @JustJared If only @mingna could pass for 18...
@moviepilotnews MAKE IT STOP
@xStarVsEvilx What's up?
@AthenaMystique "It's not a dildo! It's an authentic wand from Diagon Alley! IT CHOSE ME!""Too much Butterbeer for you."
@xStarVsEvilx Hey!
@popcsc @StarButterfly_ To me, Maleficent felt like a failed attempt at Wicked. I much prefer her as a fantastic villian.
@popcsc @StarButterfly_ I keep forgetting that Pocahontas is technically a Disney princess. Elsa did kick some ass, Anna sorta did...
@WilliamShatner @Tori_Welk @ShirleyBlantz @Davey_H @MISHASRIGHTFOOT Raise the shields! Yellow alert!
@PnF_Fan19 Another place at Universal Orlando that's awesome: @CowfishOrlando. It's a burger and sushi bar!
@PnF_Fan19 Yeah, Butterbeer is amazing. In any form. Frozen, hot, cold or ice cream.
@popcsc @StarButterfly_ That said, the only princess I don't really like is Aurora. Because she literally does nothing.
@popcsc @StarButterfly_ No, but the other princesses don't do a lot of fighting. Mulan, Merida, and Rapunzel.Unless this is Once.
@popcsc @StarButterfly_ Nah, she'd be kinda like Mulan there. She's too cool for all that.
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony "Accio Butterbeer Ice Cream!"Best ice cream in the universe. Like, better than moon ice cream.
@itsPlanty @PnF_Fan19 @cocoloony The closest we have to that is watching a baby raptor hatch.Which, not gonna lie, is pretty freaking cool
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony At the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, they have interactive wands that you can do spells with!
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony The rapids one is in Singapore, I believe.
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony Yep! Every Universal has a JP River Adventure! Three of them are the boat ride, and one is rapids.
@itsPlanty @PnF_Fan19 @cocoloony Wait, so they ROAM?! WHY DON'T WE HAVE THAT?! @UniversalORL
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony Over here they had a Triceratops Encounter, but I guess they wound up selling all of the animatronics.
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony By that, I mean it was just on the walking path.
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony They aren't working on any new rides... Yet. But they ARE building a new Kong ride next door in Orlando.
@PnF_Fan19 @itsPlanty @cocoloony Judging by the fact that people are not sitting in a River Adventure boat, it's probably just outside.
.@happines_guru Unless they're Orlando theme park rumors. Then they're carried by dreamers, spread by Twitter bloggers and accepted by media
@itsPlanty @cocoloony The River Adventure was shut down a couple weeks ago, and it felt weird. The whole focal point of JP was closed
@itsPlanty @cocoloony So, that's separate from the River Adventure. Cool!
@itsPlanty @cocoloony I'm gonna guess that's at Jurassic Park.
@NamesSoosYo @StarButterfly_ @Imagineer2018 @DaronNefcy @_AdamM @MarcoVsEvil #PhineasAndFerb #GravityFalls
I think Star Butterfly would be a pretty awesome addition to #TheAvengers. What do you guys think? #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil @StarButterfly_
@MysteryTwinDipp @PnF_Fan19 @StarButterfly_ A new one.
@YellowCranePr 
LITTLE STAR IS SO CUTE! @StarButterfly_ #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil
@DreamVisionPark @DrunkAtdisney They need to do a new version of it at Universal!
She thinks they're actually going to the "massacared." Can't wait to see where this goes.
@Chodecka @kennytorrella @cocoloony @Lochina186 @dougducey But they taste SO GOOD!
I gotta admit, if I was a kid, I would SO WANT that Crayola color alive thing. That's AWESOME.
I'm a green belt!WITH A STRIPE. #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil

Oh great, this again. #Ludo #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil #Distracted
Well that was a failure. #StarVsTheForcesOfEvil
F for FANTASTIC!
#StarVsTheForcesOfEvil @StarButterfly_ 
@DrunkAtdisney Here's the drink recipe list, BTW. 
@Park_Journey I still want a Phineas and Ferb movie!Animated!
@uncomfroterrify It's just the first episode though.
@DrunkAtdisney Universal SO needs to buy the attraction rights to Star Trek. (If they haven't done so already.)
@DrunkAtdisney And they actually had different Star Trek characters walking around that you could talk to while you were eating.
@DrunkAtdisney The Holy Rings of Betazed, the Wrap of Khan, Borgers, a drink called the Warp Core Breach... The list goes on and on.
@DrunkAtdisney One of the coolest themed restaurants EVER.
.@DrunkAtdisney Clearly none of you have ever been to Quark's. XD
@MisterCoat Totally! Jennifer Lawrence as Kim Scarlet Johansson as Shego, and Will Ferrell as Dr. Drakken.Also, PHINEAS. AND. FERB. MOVIE.
So, what's the big deal about Trader Sam's anyways? @DrunkAtdisney
@CoastinEast ZING!
@Funist10 @AcunaAndrew @stitchkingdom @BrendaSong OH MY GOD, YES. And she already knows Kung Fu.
@AcunaAndrew @stitchkingdom @DanPovenmire @mmonogram No, I've got it. A good chunk of the movie is the tragic backstory of Casey Jr.
@AcunaAndrew @stitchkingdom @DanPovenmire @mmonogram I just... Why does DUMBO need a live action remake?
@AcunaAndrew @stitchkingdom But they're doing Dumbo, which isn't far off...Seriously. Kill that and do a Phineas and Ferb movie.
@AcunaAndrew @stitchkingdom Yeah. Well, it could be worse. They could be working on a gritty live action remake of The Three Caballeros.
I wonder if they could tweak it slightly so that she's older, because a whole movie with @MingNa kicking ass would ROCK.
Mulan would actually be fun in live action because it would have a lot of kickass fight scenes. I can get behind this one. @stitchkingdom
The only way they could pull off a live action Mulan is if they had someone as kickass as @MingNa in it.Hmm... Why not Jennifer Lawrence?
@Park_Journey The transporter room on that was AMAZING. Standing in a preshow area, lights go off, and BAM. you're on the Enterprise.
@Park_Journey Really, that whole thing was FANTASTIC. If they did an attraction similar to Klingon Encounter with the new cast... #Nerdgasm
@Canada @celinedion Seriously though, Canada is a beautiful country.
.@Canada @celinedion I still don't forgive you for giving us Justin Bieber. XD
@Park_Journey I'm kinda hoping that Universal resurrects Quark's if they do Star Trek. THAT was an amazing restaurant experience.
"Yeah, we replaced all four tires"-blowout in November, another tire picks up a nail-TK: The blowout and another tire were from 2004.
@ParamountUK Do they though?Do they?
Hey @levarburton, check out this shirt I found at Target. @readingrainbow 
It was kinda cute, and I like that it kind of poked fun at itself, but it just... Doesn't need to exist. There was no reason to modernize it
Annie remake: We've got a black cast! Isn't that awesome and hip and edgy?Me: No. It's lame and pointless.
@mscibetta lol, right.
@mscibetta That's what's so weird about DHS It's the worst park, but it's got the best rides.
Might go to @SeaWorld on Wednesday. Haven't been on the amazingness that is Manta in a while.
@mscibetta Hollywood Studios is mostly closed, though. Only four rides are open.Oh wait...
"@clickorlando: Temperatures to soar in Central Fla. 
@robjyeo @DisneyParks It's white and gold. Why?
@CowboyDiplomat Yeah, they just opened up Diagon Alley and the Hogwarts Express this past summer. It's pretty amazing.
@CowboyDiplomat We don't need luck. We've got Harry Potter and several awesome rollercoasters. XD
@CowboyDiplomat Holy crap, you're stupid.
@CowboyDiplomat Everyone that goes there goes to have fun and ride some awesome rides. And why deny them that? That's why we're in business.
@CowboyDiplomat Same thing at the rest of Universal Orlando Resort. They don't discriminate, because it doesn't matter.
@CowboyDiplomat Well, I work at the place that literally invented the waterpark. And anyone who can pay to get in is welcome.
@CowboyDiplomat You mean they can't stop talking, or they constantly leave their mouth hanging open?
@CowboyDiplomat What kind of business do you run, exactly?
@CowboyDiplomat How, exactly?
@CowboyDiplomat How can you even tell? Does a gay person look different from a straight person?
@CowboyDiplomat Why does it matter what a person's sexual orientation is when you're serving them at your business? I don't understand that.
@CowboyDiplomat If you refuse service to people because of things like race, religion, or sexual orientation, you deserve to lose business.
@CowboyDiplomat If a gay person wants to get a chicken sandwich at Chik-Fil-A, why would Chik-Fil-A want to stop that?
@CowboyDiplomat What people do in their own homes is their business, but it's irrelevant when it comes to a business serving them.
@CowboyDiplomat Well, I for one am proud to work for a place that doesn't discriminate... Against guests OR employees. #EqualityFTW
@CowboyDiplomat Money is money. If you're that offended by the fact that you see some gay people, maybe you shouldn't be running a business.
@CowboyDiplomat I work at Wet 'N Wild in Orlando, and we get people from all over the world, from all walks of life. And that's great!
@CowboyDiplomat What gets me is: why would people want to loose business? A customer is a customer.
@Airmanfirst @VIKKIDELL @foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi Why can't they focus this energy on outlawing abortions &amp; promoting adoption?
@mohican716 @foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi I'm Republican and Catholic, and I think this law is BS.
@foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi The other thing is, how can you tell? To quote J.K Rowling, gay people look like... People.
@VIKKIDELL @foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi As someone who is Catholic, whatever happened to "Love thy neighbor?"
@VIKKIDELL @foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi This law is not only immoral... I'm pretty sure it's unconstitutional.
@VIKKIDELL @foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi Religious freedom is about being accepting of other religions and beliefs.
@foxandfriends @FDRLST @davidharsanyi Religious freedom is being accepting and tolerant of other beliefs. This is discrimination.
@oreozaynie @honestfandom There already is a fandom!
@honestfandom Yes!
@adam_s_j Yeah, pretty much.
@sandwinches Welcome aboard!
@sarahdessen @netflix They keep saying they're taking it off, and then they never do.
@MissMabel618 @StarButterfly_ I think you two would get along really well together.
@MissMabel618 @StarButterfly_ Girls, girls, can't we be friends?
@xStarVsEvilx Hey!
@pizzahut You guys should have a jalapeño stuffed crust.
@syxhirah @andyserkis I unintentionally retweeted that, but hey.
What was the point of keeping the park open an extra hour and a half if everyone leaves at 6:00?Of course, we didn't count on this weather
The final hour of running Black Hole, we had a grand total of six people. Three groups.
@WholyCheesus At @CowfishOrlando, my dad drizzled his fries in Siracha. It was delicious. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@DiegoDrummer69 Also, they should have you be able to build a shopping district outside of your park. #RCTWorld
@DiegoDrummer69 It sounds like they're going to have prefab big restaurants, which is cool, but they should let you build custom ones too.
@DiegoDrummer69 I think I've only been on one rollercoaster that loads like the ones on Rollercoaster Tycoon do. And that's Giant Dipper.
@DiegoDrummer69 Express pass, greeters, turnstiles... Things that real theme parks have.
@DiegoDrummer69 Also, the waterpark expansion pack needs to be way more realistic.
@DiegoDrummer69 My biggest thing is that I want more realistic coasters, as well as loading stations, queues and employees.
@DiegoDrummer69 Look at the trailer. More dislikes than likes, Nd look at the comments.
@VideoGamerMe They know that the game's not finished yet, right?
I love how everyone's complaining about the graphics in Rollercoaster Tycoon World. Uh, guys... IT'S NOT FINISHED YET.
@CowfishOrlando @ShulaBurger @redrobinburgers Also, they all have amazing French fries.
Best places in Orlando to get gourmet burgers:@CowfishOrlando@ShulaBurger @redrobinburgers
Somehow my profile got totally messed up last night, and put a box of @WhiteCastleLV frozen sliders as my profile pic.
@UUOPodcast @aengus @UniversalORL @derekburgan @CowfishOrlando Jalapeño popper, Apple Berry &amp; Brie and Hunka Love are all very good.
@UUOPodcast @aengus @UniversalORL @derekburgan @CowfishOrlando Still need to try Antojitos...
@UniversalORL @derekburgan @UUOPodcast @CowfishOrlando Oh, and they brought out a dessert sushi roll because it was my belated birthday. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@UniversalORL @derekburgan @UUOPodcast @CowfishOrlando Also, I love the look and feel of the restaurant. It's a one of a kind experience.
@UniversalORL @derekburgan @UUOPodcast @CowfishOrlando It was delicious! Everyone else got burgers, and I tried a bite of each. All amazing.
@UniversalORL @derekburgan @UUOPodcast My phone died, and by the time I got home, I was exhausted. I got the @CowfishOrlando Bento Box.
@UniversalORL @CowfishOrlando @UUOPodcast @derekburgan That's the question... The Jalapeño Popper Showstopper sounds amazing...
I'm finally going to go eat at @CowfishOrlando! Excited! @UniversalORL @UUOPodcast @derekburgan
@Attractions Hopefully the new one tells guests that they need a token, and where the entrance is. Because signs aren't enough, apparently
In other news, there's a new audio loop over at Brain Wash. Probably a placeholder until they get a new safety spiel in place. @Attractions
le thing.
#NowWatching Phineas and Ferb Star Wars
@hulitherium Yes.
@mckinley_mike I love Data. Brent Spiner is amazing. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mckinley_mike Most of these sound more like stuff Data would say.
@SuperheroFeed #TeamSkywalker
@jessleber Screw that. I would leave immediately.
@tonygoldmark Hey, random side note: wha'd you think of the Star Wars trailer?
@LegitKuzco @tonygoldmark Trolls do all sorts of stupid stuff.
@SuperheroFeed I just... It's the same shit we've seen before. It's DC being dark, gritty and overly serious because that's all they know.
@SuperheroFeed I can't see anything. It's too dark and gritty.
@SuperheroFeed But that's not Superman's character. He should've tried to get the fight away from Metropolis!
@LastManFOX Is it cancelled?
@LegitKuzco Right.And yet somehow, they can air commercials for everything else.
@LegitKuzco No, it's not Disney. It's a law.
@LegitKuzco You can only have so many commercials.
@LegitKuzco That's actually something that I would eventually want to do.
@LegitKuzco Unfortunately, due to stupid legal reasons involving kids networks, there could never be a Disney World episode.
@LegitKuzco Yeah, those are allowed. People do stuff like that all the time.
@LegitKuzco And the rest is history.
@LegitKuzco Swampy had followed me, so I sent him a DM and asked if he wanted to play Monogram in the sequel. He said that he would love to.
@LegitKuzco @_AlexHirsch SO MANY MYSTERIES.
@LegitKuzco It did well, and I had fun doing it, so I wrote a sequel that would coincide with our school's annual Storm 101 carnival.
@LegitKuzco I proved him wrong. The first one aired in December, and it did really well. My school, the fandom and Swampy liked it.
.@LegitKuzco So, the story behind this, @ThatSleazyKid told me that I wouldn't be able to pull off a P&amp;F Staffer.
@LegitKuzco Right.
@LegitKuzco She was too good. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@LegitKuzco Mekayla and Mrs. Carpenter did a great job as Candace and Linda, respectively. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco lol
@LegitKuzco What do you mean? XD
@LegitKuzco @tonygoldmark Eh, let Disney Channel be stupid.
@LegitKuzco Eh. If they came after me, (which they're not going to) Swampy would testify for me. XD
@LegitKuzco But there's nothing copyright infringing about this. It's an original story.
@LegitKuzco They're not going to take down a video that one of the co-creators of the show AGREED to star in. XD
@LegitKuzco Uh... No. It's a parody. Parody is protected by copyright law. Also, @mmonogram did a cameo in this one.
@LegitKuzco Isn't Disney Channel doing Adventures in Babysitting?
@LegitKuzco @DanPovenmire @mmonogram Bahahahaha
@LegitKuzco Yeah, he actually wasn't a massive Star Trek fan, but he and his team still did a great job with it!
@LegitKuzco Everyone that's making the new movies grew up watching the original trilogy. Which is awesome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LegitKuzco That's what's exciting about the new Star Wars movies. J.J Abrams is a fantastic director, and a HUGE Star Wars fan.
