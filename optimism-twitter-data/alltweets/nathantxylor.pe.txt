Privatising the NHS

Getting a stab wound and being told to just apply a wet paper towl

That'll be £300 please
I wish I could be like the cool kids
How are you putting up 50 second stories it's only 11:30<SLEEPING FACE>
@fandman that is insane, makes you realise how many privileges UK actually has
@fandman £30k just to push a baby out and then get kicked out later? That is poor behaviour
@ghostlycharl yeah I know. But people don't even understand labour or conservatives, they just vote for what everyone is doing
I can guarantee most people at uni will work much harder now they realise how much their education actually costs
@ghostlycharl it's so annoying, it's like everyone has just fallen into this mind set of what everyone else says is right?
#RaiseSolidersWages
I prefer people who genuinely have a mind of their own and not fall into the minds of others.
#votenoone
@chahnrei I mean I'm half on half, I don't really care for politics but some of the issues people are complaining about is rly stressing me
Only thing I'm not too happy about is privatising NHS. You gonna charge me £500 for my wife to deliver our baby?
@coleeyolee indeed it can. But at the end of your course you'll be rewarded with a degree or so which can open up many opportunities
STOP EXPECTING EVERYTHING TO BE HANDED TO YOU.
In all fairness, people who are complaining about the poor getting poorer are the ones who are TOO LAZY to go and earn themselves a living
@coleeyolee as you spend £50000 to become a surgeon and then you pay that off in a year
@coleeyolee True, like doctors/surgeons should be paid more because of the risks they take daily, which is why tuition should be raised too-
@coleeyolee to get paid something like that
@coleeyolee yeah true, however a job stacking shelves in sainsburys shouldn't pay £8 an hour. A person should have to earn a good job -
Tuition fee's should also be raised considering the amount of opportunities you can earn from them, e.g masters degree/PhD.
People should have to WORK HARD to get the pay they deserve, and opportunities shouldn't just be handed to them. They should have to EARN it
Personally I think labour is stupid, why aim to raise minimum wage to £8 an hour? Why pay a unskilled person the same wage as a train person
Why do people who no nothing about politics suddenly tweet like they know everything??
This makes me feel sick<FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
