Having a low self esteem isn't cool, aspire to be better aspire to feel better.
Could this be earth, could this be life?
Every expert was once a beginner, no one is really an expert anyway.

Patience is virtue and I know I will b fulfilled.
All u gotta do is say yes, don't deny what you're feelin
Abundance is mine and what I seek is pure.
I am talented.
Talk to/about yourself as if youve already made it to that point. "I AM a boss"
YOU ARE GREAT, AND FUCKING COOL AS FUCK.
