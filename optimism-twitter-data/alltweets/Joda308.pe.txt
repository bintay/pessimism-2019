It brought about two of my faves (@kelly_clarkson and @carrieunderwood) but this was a long time coming. See you, never American Idol.
My #MondayMotivation was that the #PrettyGirlsMusicVideo was supposed to premiere today. I'm not convinced.
Dear Taylor, We know you have a lot of famous girlfriends. I'm just not sure Katy cares... #BadBloodMusicVideo
Guess the #BritneyArmy shouldn't feel too bad about #PrettyGirls... 
Stop pretending these pics youre posting are for your mom. We all know it's just to make you feel like youre a good kid. #HappyMothersDay
.@stampepk just tried to claim his free bday drink from @StarbucksUK but since his acct was based in the States they wouldn't accept it.
Just what Mom has always wanted...? 
@Francoooombs Oh I've noticed before. But today it's a complete division. Normally there's one or two out of place.
Just realized that the office is completely self segregated today. We're so progressive.
Work Bxxch sold more than Pretty Girls is projected to sell in it's first week. So much for Song of the Summer 2015...
It's sad that I'm excited for my cheese and jam sandwich. It's the little things.
Mark your calendars. #PrettyGirlsVideoWorldPremiere3Days 
I'm just going to say it. I don't like Chrissy Teigen. I have no reason. But I just dont like her.
At least #PrettyGirls is still getting really great radio play updates. Hoping the music video and #BBMAs will give it the boost it needs.
Having one out of twelve days off does not qualify as a weekend. Shift work is absolute bullshit. Can I go back to having a real job please?
I was NOT prepared for the mass sheep suicide &amp; dog death in #FarFromTheMaddingCrowd. Ive never covered my eyes so much in a romance movie.
Date night for Stamper-Halpins: 2-for-1 movie tickets, a chick flick, and a massive popcorn. Romance is alive and well. <TWO MEN HOLDING HANDS><CLAPPER BOARD> (@stampepk)
I'm not positive but I think, I think, some planes flew over #DC today? #VEDay70 #DCflyover
.@KylieJenner has done literally nothing in her life worth mentioning, yet shes everywhere bc she has large, fake lips? I HATE THE INTERNET.
They don't see my rolling my eyes. They buzzin' around me like flies...
Working my first event in 2mo tonight. Hopefully event management is the same as riding a bike.
The smell of rotisserie chicken in the grocery store threatens my #vegetarianism every time I go shopping...
@D1anaT0th @stampepk Do it.
@Francoooombs I dont mean you or people. I mean the pop ups at the top of the page that won't go awayyyy.
I wish there was a way for Twitter and Faceboook to realize I am not allowed to vote in this country. The constant reminders are excessive.
Proud hubby. 
@stampepk Damn if that didnt get her what will? Just piss her off and she'll go on a twitter rant with a . before all the @'s so we all see.
...and I legit just slipped on a banana peel. Didn't not realize #MarioKart was based in real life.
I just realised its 1030pm on Wednesday on the West Coast as I head to work on Thursday. Time zones are weird.
630am shift follows by working an event at LFM for Sony. It's gone be a loooong day.
The #Queen has a pretty impressive #view (minus the #tourists) 
@Bethenny I think the diff is in past seasons you knew the Wives better. It seems more aggressive this season as you're just "meeting" them.
This is actually HYSTERICAL. Well played, @MariahCarey. You so corny.


At home ironing, drinking chamomile mint tea while the hubby is at a pub. Is #LadiesOfLondon recruiting bc I make an excellent housewife.
.@DorindaMedley's daughter has been on this season of #RHONY more than @KristenTaekman and I don't get it...
But man the quality of the front facing camera on the iPhone 4s is <OK HAND SIGN>üèª, right?
Welp, today was hands down my worst day of work since I started. At least my new haircut is on point... #selfie 

Right - Influential People at the Met Gala.. 
Britney Spears on repeat, always. #collegein5words
@BradySpears I MISS REAL AVOCADOS!
@BradySpears 
I wore rain boots and brought extra pants as it was torrential downpour as I was leaving the flat. Now, its gorgeous. This country... SMH
Apparently @taylorswift13 does a mashup of my two favorite songs on her #1989Tour. I need #Enchanted/#WildestDreams in HQ ASAP!
When you read "Dozens of Margaritas Feared Dead" instead of "Migrants" you know it's time for bed on #CincoDeMayo
.@stampepk made freshhhh. Limeeee. Margaritassss. for #CincoDeMayo! Haven't had tequila in almost a year now. It ain't no joke! <TROPICAL DRINK><FLUSHED FACE>
Love the @britneyspears iTunes banner. The aesthetic this era is on point. The fact that it doesnt mention Iggy? Cherry on top. #PrettyGirls
I don't understand the obsession with #SeeYouAgain. The Wiz Khalifa version that is. @MileyCyrus's I totally get.
Mariah trying to steal the spotlight from Britney at the #BBMAS. Have a feeling she'll be cast into the shadow of the #PrettyGirls
With the rare exception, I would have never guessed the theme was "China: Through the Looking Glass‚Äù at #MetGala2015 based on the dresses.
@stampepk Kind of cool.  
@Danielf90 idk how you do that. I do shifts at work too but it just varies time throughout the day and I think that's bad enough!
.@britneyspears on Ellen announcing extended dates for #PieceOfMe. Fails to mention #PrettyGirls. Remains pretty. 
#PrettyGirls is released the same day in history after constant comparisons. Coincidence? Seems fitting to me.  
@britneyspears Me, all the way from the UK! Wasn't easy being abroad but where there's a will there's a way! Good thing you're so prettay!
...when a group of people at work just spend most of the day chatting while the rest of us answer all the calls. 
.@tkylemac Does she not realize that's why the lyrics are from Australia to LA? Dead. Good thing she's just so prettay!
Well said @billboard. 3.5/5 stars for #PrettyGirls  
From one (potentially) future queen to the reigning queen @britneyspears, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana implores you to #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes
Followed and unfollowed someone in less than 24 hrs because all they do is RT other peoples accts. #annoying
But actually, why does the UK always get music so much later? #PrettyGirls was released everywhere else besides the UK? I dont get it.
@ThePopZone Ugh neither. Both were so disappointing.
I have an unhealthy obsession with edamame. In shell. Shelled. Doesnt matter. Give me the beans!
@AzButterfield Yes. I know short is good for radio but it needs a bit more. And also the grating vocals could've been toned down just a tad.
@ThePopZone Done and done on my US acct all the way from the UK.
@ThePopZone *29 countries!
I hate when KWORB isnt updating and there is such a lag on the popularity bars! How am I supposed to track Pretty Girls success from the UK?
@AzButterfield It's gotta have shrimp on the barbie on top. I think its Australian?
.@britneyspears and I have a lot in common. We both have a Maltese and we both love salad. Pretty girls, indeed.
@AzButterfield She loves salad!
@AzButterfield Haha yes I LOVED it.
Also the fact that @britneyspears is not sure if @IGGYAZALEA is from Australia or not kills me.
I love that every time @britneyspears talks about her meeting with @IGGYAZALEA she talks about how they had salad. #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes
.@britneyspears sounds so natural and happy on the Z100 interview this morning. #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes
#BankHolidayMonday and I'm at work. Again. But don't foget to #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes even though you can't in the UK...
@AzButterfield @IGGYAZALEA You're not alone, not alone, not alone, not alone...
<EYES> them <WAVING HAND SIGN>üèª, it's just so <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>, like <HONEYBEE><HONEYBEE> to the <HONEY POT>! #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes
#MayThe4thBeWithYou as you #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes
@AzButterfield @RUDPOP @ShaneAvery @MikeyNied still so much better than the GMA promos for FF when she sounded like a chain smoking hooker.
Old is when you Google donut cushions for your chair at work &amp; impulse buy a wrist rest mouse pad bc life shouldnt be this uncomfortable.
Guys, Pretty Girls will be on @iTunesMusic tomorrow! #BuyPrettyGirlsOniTunes @britneyspears @IGGYAZALEA 
Not feeling this working till midnight thing. No bank holiday for me. 
.@Popjustice The desperation is REAL. #TidalForNoone
Fine, I'll say it. Tom's Diner &gt; Pretty Girls. Sorry, not sorry.
Can't wait to work 3-midnight tonight after getting virtually no sleep due to a psycho puppy named Gus.
FOUND: a vinyl copy of @Xtina's "Lady Marmalade" for ¬£1 alongside a copy of @Beyonce's "Baby Boy" feat 4 remixes.
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey Baybayyyy!"
I find the Pretty Girls chorus vocally grating, but now that I know Iggy is singing as well it all makes sense.
@AzButterfield But Pretty Girls seems to be everything radio friendly right now. Aka obnoxious and incredibly catchy.
@AzButterfield haha your tune changed pretty quickly about Toms Diner though.
@AzButterfield you've been unusually quiet about the Pretty Girls leak.
IMPORTANT. Iggy autocorrects to ugly. My iPad is one shady Britney stan. I guess Pretty Girls should not be plural...
Iggy really wants you to know @britneyspears is on Pretty Girls. "Where you at Brit?" "What's up, Britney?" She's just so prettay!
.@stampepk's 19yo cousin: "Do you guys always go to bed this early?" Me: "One day when you're 28 youll understand..." #Old and proud of it.
@rapemegodney Just put it on repeat. It just grows.
Pretty Girls leaked so Ill be locked in my room listening on repeat for the next week. Please respect my privacy during this difficult time.
Britney needs to be the first pop act to perform in space, not Gaga. She clearly has an obsession w/it. OIDIA, Alien, Pretty Girls.
All around the world pretty girls wipe the floor with all the boys
TTWE Remix his parents were in town. Perfume we were at his friends place. Pretty Girls is cousin is here.
Every time a Britney song leaks @stampepk has friends or family over and I have to lock myself in the other room to listen to it on repeat.
I love how many times Iggy name drops Britney in Pretty Girls.
Likes bees to the honey. We're just so pretty.
Love that there is some classic Britney in Pretty Girls with the breathy "uh huh" and the "just so prettayyyayyyy"
Remember when you'd discover new songs on the radio? I miss those days. Imagine having no idea and then Pretty Girls just came on the radio.
Sad that we live in a world where I find it impressive that Pretty Girls only leaked a few days out.
On first listen: Work Bitch &gt; Pretty Girls. I had a much stronger reaction to WB but PG is def a bop.
@PieceofBritney I just think it's funny how much Iggy cared about it. Clearly makes no actual difference. #PrettyGirls
Dear Iggy, singing 2 words in the prechorus does not make it a duet. You are feat on a @britneyspears song. Sorry not sorry. #PrettyGirls
#PrettyGirls leaks the same day as the girl #RoyalBaby is born. Coincidence? I think not. #GayHeaven
This is what all people look less than 12hrs  after they have a baby, right? #RoyalBaby 
May have just had the best #macncheese of my life thanks to @themacfac at the @urbanfoodfest in #Shoreditch. #dead 
There is a queue wrapped around Buckingham Palace to take a photo of the official #RoyalBaby announcement.. 
@Francoooombs we didn't stick around, just walked by to see the mania. We're out and about touristing with the hubby's cousin anyway.
@Francoooombs can pretty much guarantee I'll never be in the UK for another #RoyalBaby
@Francoooombs uh, CLEARLY!
Quite the crowd outside the Lindo Wing and St Mary's! #RoyalBaby celebration in full force! 
#np Shotgun - Christina Aguilera from @Nashville_ABC. Love controlled, understated @Xtina.
Off to St Mary's to be a part of the insanity celebrating the birth of the #RoyalBaby! Perhaps we'll catch a glimpse of Royalty...
This is the first @britneyspears era in ages that I'm actually enjoying the aesthetic. 
I honestly thought this pic was 10 years old. She looks ridiculously young here. #PrettyGirls  
Brits choreo is looking on. Point. In the #PrettyGirls music video clip.
"I've got a lot of farm and barn instruments ready for the zombie apocalypse." - @bittenpub. Unexpected turn at the #RiPPLE2015 launch.
"Free booze and heaps of toilets. Sounds like my kind of party." - me about the launch of the book feat.  @stampepk's editorial debut
@AzButterfield the impact.
The amount of press @britneyspears is getting for signing a deal for a game app is astounding. Living #legend, you can look but dont touch.
Ive agreed w/@Bethenny in every confrontation so far but her delivery this season is a-ggress-ive. Simmer girl! #TheBisBack, indeed. #RHONY
@tkylemac Literally 1min after I tweeted at you it appeared on my TL
@tkylemac I have somehow gone the entire day w/out seeing this yet this year... *knocks on wood
@AzButterfield Ugh that bridge kills me. It was such prime Xtina, amazing voice but actually controlled rather than belting for no reason.
@AzButterfield Welcome &gt; EtC
@AzButterfield I do to. But like Walk Away way more. Like potentially my favourite song from the album more.
@AzButterfield Yes, if I'm forced to cut something I can do without intros I would never just put on.
@AzButterfield Enter the Circus and Welcome are both unnecessary. But yes Disc 2 was way better .
@AzButterfield Stripped Pt 2 and Walk Away are essential. Get Keep on Signing My Song, the other interludes, and IDK for the 4th out.
But really, how amazing is this photo? It's #AmericanGothic gone #BritishCityfarm 
@AzButterfield Which tracks would you cut? Ready. Go!
@aurosan #SuperSweet16 
@AzButterfield Those Sony Discmans really did damage to my CDs!
@AzButterfield #gay2000sboyproblems
.@stampepk be prepared.  
Giving off major sassy llama vibes with the hair today. 
Just had a early-20s male call in and I could hear Destiny's Child #IndependentWomen playing in the background. #living
A 58 year old woman just said, "Oh jolly, good!" on the phone. Again, #dead.
@AzButterfield I had to buy a second copy of the Stripped CD bc I played it so much it started to skip.
.@stampepk @HoZ_Books 
@stampepk #no
I knew it didn't get very warm here in the summer but I didn't realise I'd be able to see my breath in the morning at the end of April.
1 week to #PrettyGirls!
I've said it before and I'll say it again, #Bionic is light years better than #Lotus. #Justice4Bionic
@AzButterfield No he's just too loyal to Brit. Work Bitch is his favorite. "Now get to work Gus!" #Stan4Lyfe
@AzButterfield My dog did not have the same response as your cat. I started singing out loud, he glared at me, then retreated to his bed.
#np Bound to You - @xtina...thanks @AzButterfield
@D1anaT0th Or a nicer job?
Overheard at work: "It feels so weird not watching any football right now." That's what's weird? Not that you're having to work on a Sunday?
@AzButterfield Play him "Right Man" and see if he looks at you longingly.
When your tail bone is constantly sore form sitting all day I think that tells you that you are not cut out to be doing desk work...
@AzButterfield At least he likes the good songs.
@AzButterfield I need to get away from ya, need to walk away from ya get away, walk away, walk away....
I wonder how long Tom's Diner is going to be stuck in my head for...
Why's this girls voice like nails on a chalk board today? You know youre in a grumpy mood when someone being overly friendly pisses you off.


When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head...
Mmmm matzo ball soup.
Instead I pour the milk...
@billboard Girogio tweeted about it so def seems to be the real deal.
I hope all these articles complementing @giorgiomoroder for bringing out the best in @britneyspears recognize that Tom's Diner was her idea.
.@giorgiomoroder really needs to capitalize on this coverage Tom's Diner is getting and out it up on @iTunesMusic ASAP. #TomsDinerOniTunes
@breatheheavycom infinitely better than the album cover...
@tkylemac Womp. Good to know. Makes more sense now.
@breatheheavycom 7
@breatheheavycom really wish he hadn't cut the song in half. And agreed on the bridge. But still into it.
@AzButterfield perhaps bc it's only half the song. How about that bridge though? Great stuff, right?
I was midtweet when Tom's Diner leaked. 1hr later... If you don't already follow me on Insta! 
Britney has not mentioned that she recorded Tom's Diner once and yet it has gotten a #1 WW TT. I cannot. The power of Godney is real.
@AzButterfield So do I.
@AzButterfield I feel like most Britney fans didn't know the original which is tainting my view drastically. Still enjoying it though.
@AzButterfield I feel like the song loses it's meaning when you drop off the last verse and ending...*waits for death threats from the Army*
@AzButterfield It's good. Real talk: is it everything I hoped for now. But it'll do. Stupid Giorgio and his bridge.
@AzButterfield They should play it at the Britney themed night tonight! They will if they know what's good for them...
If Tom's Diner is making the internet blow up this much imagine whats going to happen when #PrettyGirls drops. May 5th cant come soon enough
Wonder why Giorgio chose to leave out a full verse of Tom's Diner. Wheres the woman looking at her own reflection and hitching up her skirt?
But let's be honest, that additional bridge Giorgio added to Tom's Diner is unnecessary garbage.
Wait, is this TT really going to be #1 WW? This is bananas. Tom's Diner is coming for you...Arabic saying.
Pretty sure neither #Dejavu or #RightHereRightNow trended when they were released, just saying. And Tom's Diner is a cover. The impact.
Wow. Tom's Diner is trending worldwide. The power of @britneyspears never ceases to amaze me. #BritneyArmy is thirsty for new music, y'all.
Living for the "duh duh dada." Can't wait until someone isolates the vocals and strips down the verses. Please, @remixedbynick? #TomsDiner
It's here!  #TomsDiner @britneyspears @giorgiomoroder 
@nxtbrinty @MuuMuse #TruthTea 
Also sounds like Brit never got around to recording that new bridge that Moroder had spoken about based on the 2nd leak. #TomsDiner
The "chorus" (duh duh duh...) leak gave me chills. That's what I wanted the whole thing to be. Hope the HQ sounds better. #TomsDiner
So glad I stopped watching #GreysAnatomy several season ago. I would not have been able to handle yet another main character death. #McDead
@DieWithoutBrit Fingers crossed. I love the original and think it was a brilliant idea. Just hope it lives up to the hype/my expectations!
@DieWithoutBrit Still confused why he would go on record saying that it was very natural when it sounds to be the exact opposite?
Perfect day to be up in the sky. #London 
The verdict's in. Best #burger we've had since moving to #London, hands down. Well done @honestburgers! 
Taking in the views with the birthday boy  (@stampepk) at the #SkyGarden! #London 
Homemade buttermilk (American) biscuits and "sausage" gravy for @stampepk's bday breakfast! #YUM  
@Danielf90 no space to waste. Dinner offer still stand?
@Danielf90 those abbrevs haha. Decoded.
@Danielf90 @Danielf90 love a good shoe, ha. Helen Mirren must have been amazing. Seeing Bradley Cooper in Elephant Man for my bday. Pumped.
@Danielf90 how were the shoes today?! Saw Wicked with the fam last month and loved it.
@stampepk @meistege @KeerstinNoBull Late. For sure. Mid is 24-26. SORRY.
@Danielf90 He tweets moments before you RT about being front row at Wicked...
@Danielf90 Idk if youd have time between all your holiday travel, work, and theatre going...ha.
HOLY MOTHER, ITS CONFIRMED! #PrettyGirls #BBMAs @billboard @britneyspears @IGGYAZALEA
@Danielf90 No, just while the hubby is in grad school. Visas are valid through Jan '16. Were in Wimbledon.
@Danielf90 In storage (aka my parents basement) back in the States.
@Danielf90 Everything we own after the wedding was C&amp;B. I miss our things now!
@GayTimesMag @AzButterfield @PTButton Noooo I work at 7am on Saturday!
@AzButterfield Jesus!
@AzButterfield this is getting a bit excessive.
@AzButterfield Ah you clearly looked into this more than me. Well done. Didn't know the Glamberts were so active on the Tweeter.
@AzButterfield People are loving our interaction this morning...weird since they were @ each other and primarily w/out hashtags. FAMOUS.
Could @buzzfeed have made this any easier? I mean honestly. 

"Can You Guess The #Britney Video From The Screengrab?"

@AzButterfield Excited for this new era. I actually really liked #Trespassing even though it never did that well.
@AzButterfield ... It's hard to say it, time to say it... 11/13. Goodbye, goodbye.
@AzButterfield Just took a quiz to see how well I remember the lyrics to #Photograph. WHY IS NICKELBACK SO PROMINENT IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW?
Love me some Vanessa Carlton but home girl has gotta stop with this echo-y bullshit. Bring back #HeroesAndTheives, please. #YoungHeart
@breatheheavycom Ugh was really hoping she would found her way out of the wind tunnel she was in for the entirety of #RabbitsOnTheRun
Desperado: Tequila flavoured beer? No. Who wants that?! More like Desperadno, amIright?
An 83 year old man just said goodbye on the phone bye saying "Cheerio." I could not be happier.
@AzButterfield *unfollows*
My favorite #Disney villain hands down. #Ursula, you are fab. 


I love (HATE) when you unsubsribe from a mailing list and then they email you to say you've been successfully unsubscribed.
And tonight @stampepk and I are hosting our first #SundayRoast. Really Brit-ing it up today.
M&amp;D got us a tea hamper as a thank you for being great hosts so having a proper #AfternoonTea at home today. #British 
YOUR BANANA SLICES AREN'T EVEN THE SAME WIDTH.
Why do people feel a need to post food photos of meals as mundane as a wrap and sliced banana? No one is impressed. 
.@djearworm and @carrieunderwood? Yes, please. 
@tkylemac red skin, red hair, dont care.
@Francoooombs...its orange?
Did not realise the @zeldasymphony concert was costume optional. Missed opportunity for sure... #zelda
Well @Citymapper has failed me for the first time. Didn't account for this 20min wait between trains. Guess we're getting dinner on the go.
Orchestral music <BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK>Ô∏è Video games <BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK>Ô∏è All of @stampepk's fav things (sans books)? <BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK>Ô∏è Seeing @zeldasymphony for his bday was a good idea, no?
Car reserved and tickets booked for our #HarryPotter @wbtourlondon when @amandajleech comes to visit next month! So. Excited.
@Francoooombs Thanks for swapping!
.@Bethenny is on quite the media blitz. Great to see her out &amp; about, back in the public eye. #RHONY #iSuckAtRelationships #skinnygirl
18 days and counting until #PrettyGirls
Oh. Apparently @giorgiomoroder's album is called Deja Vu...not 74 is the new 24. Enough with Sia already.
Someone did an @instagram post about their 2mo anniversary. Were in our late 20s now. Pretty sure month anniversaries are not appropriate...
Why would anyone pay that much money to be front row at a @britneyspears if you thought she was a "fat bitch?" 
Remember that time Suzanne Vega favorited my tweet about @britneyspears covering #TomsDiner?
Holy mother it is cold in this office this morning.
So happy that @britneyspears will be covering @suzyv's #TomsDiner for @giorgiomoroder's upcoming LP, '74 is the New 24.' #PopPerfection
@cait1231 Open Toes 2.0?!  
This makes me so #sad for the world: "A Man Played So Much #CandyCrush He Ruptured The Tendon In His Thumb"

@stampepk Gonna tell everyone to lighten up?
Most of these look ridic but I could def get behind @jhutch1992 w/ a #beard. #swoon


I got more like Rachel. This could not be anymore false. #Friends @buzzfeed 
Was convinced I was speaking to a woman during an entire call...then I saw their name. Wow.
@AzButterfield I still can't believe they let her film that.
@AzButterfield muy triste.
"This album cover looks like an oil painting portrait of a @MariahCarey wax figure that was made in the late 90s." 
#Grey, indeed. "19 Types Of British Weather, Ranked" 
Im offiically #old as f*%&amp;. I compelely pulled my neck taking towels of the rack. I don't even understand what happend, but i cant move.
@D1anaT0th @stampepk is busy at a book fair so I doubt he'll meet his reply w/in mins commitment this time. I shall tweet you on his behalf.
@MuuMuse Ask Camilla how she ended up in a car with Taylor Swift...
Apparently 'curb' is spelled 'kerb' in the #UK. The number of variations between our versions of #English continue to amaze me.
My sarcastic tweet about #1D was feat on @gaystarnews, alongside @aurosan. Guess Im offiically twitter #famous now?
 

Just remembered I had a dream @Madonna and I were trying to take a #selfie but neither of us could get our front facing camera to work.
#Hillary2016
I never understand when an artist chooses a photo for their album cover where their face looks bad, even after photoshop. #RevealMariah
@aurosan Ill be holding you personally accountable if this goes poorly. #JinxYouOweMeACoke
And no, I dont mean this #criminal. I wish. @britneyspears 
It seems #criminal to be inside on such a perfect day. I hope we see more days like this in the future so I can enjoy it rather than work.
Gorgeous day for lunch in the park with the hubby (@stampepk) and the pup. #MarriedLife #GusPic 
Can I go back 2hrs to when I was at home eating my egg bagel, drinking tea, &amp; listening to @kelly_clarkson? That was a much better #Sunday.
The number of #ITissues this company has astounds me. How hard is it to have working phones? Happy Sunday, indeed.
.@breatheheavycom #JusticeForAlien
How do aliens and 80's car wash go together? So confused. #PrettyGirls 
Realizing that that makes this shirt older than people in middle school. God we're #old.
After listening to @falloutboy + @therejects all a.m., rockin my #DashboardConfessional (@ChrisCarrabba) tshirt Ive had since '03. So #emo.
God I really hope this is true. Loved the original, can only imagine how much Id stan for a Brit version. #TomsDiner 
So apparently it's a grill and I am not up to date on my pop culture anymore. Still dont get it, but ok. #BitchItsMadonna
If Thursday is your Saturday, treat it like Saturday. Drinking in our garden after a day of touristing. #London 
@NathanSawaya loved the "In Pieces" section. So great to see the Legos applied into an everyday situation. Definitely my favourite part.
Glad @stampepk and I got to see @NathanSawaya's #ArtOfBrick exhibit before it closed in London. 
Went around the #Globe in 30 mins. Get it? #puns (w/ @stampepk) #Shakespeare 
Treating ourselves to a brownie and coffee at @leonrestaurants to make up for it.
Finally ate at Pod. For a place that prides itself on healthy food I was underwhelmed by the no. of #veg options. And it was bland.
@stampepk #hashtag
Touring the #GlobeTheater then heading up to #Shoreditch to see the #ArtOfBrick exhibit before it closes w/ @stampepk. #SHinUK #London
Where did this insane tooth gap that @madonna has been sporting come from? #GhosttownVideo
Today is my Friday! Pumped to finally have two days off with nothing to do and no one to entertain. #exhausted
.@Bethenny is back! 
Officially Budapest bound in May with @stampepk! The euro travel continues. #Hungary
Wow I've had so many typos in my tweets this morning. Guess I should not walk, shiver, and tweet at the same time. #fail
I've been saying going #vegetarian has helped with my kidney stones. Now there seems to be proof! 
Either Ramona over lined her lips for this #TodayShow interview or she had some work done post-Mario. #RHONY
Found this mug at work today. It so everything. I can't. #RoyalWedding #tea 
It should not be cold enough where I can see my breath this morning if it's going to get up to the mid-60s (20C) thus afternoon.
630am shift. Takes me back to my early days at Haute. At least I get to leave at 3.
Got @stampepk out of the flat to come and meet me for a beer at the pub after work. Ok fine, it was his idea. 
@Bethenny you look thrilled to be there ha. Can't wait for your return on Tuesday!
#Sparks is such a perfect blend of @HilaryDuff and @iamtovelo. I can distinctively hear both of their influences on the song. #Sparks
Wait I had no idea #Duffsters were so active on twitter. Just had more RTs and faves on a tweet than I have in ages. #Sparks
Granted I feel like whistling in songs was all the rage circa 2011 (i.e. #IWannaGo) but whatever, it works. #Sparks
#Sparks is lightyears above #AllAboutMe &amp;#ChasingtheSun. So happy #Dignity @HilaryDuff is back. Well done, @iamtovelo. Another catchy hit.
I've had a  headache for 4 days straight now. Dear pain, please go away. Not so heart, Jonathan
Still dont get why @rihanna waited 2yrs to release new music, then dropped 2 singles, a soundtrack, &amp; bball anthem all at the same time. #R8

The owner of the #vineyard we toured today was such a #bae. Oui, se il vous pla√Æt. #Bordeaux 
@stampepk No.
That'll do wind, that'll do. #BlownAway
Couldn't have the parents visit without doing a proper afternoon #tea. #London #delicious 
.@stampepk loves him some #BOOKS! #amreading #London #BritishMuseum 
#Princess Diana wallpaper at #KensingtonPalace 
Reading #TheGirlOnTheTrain while riding the tube this morning. How fitting.
Heading to #LHR to pick up mom and dad while @stampepk is off to #LGW to get the sister. Well planned, Halpins. #HalpinsTakeTheUK
@jakebley when did apyro become so terrifying?
My mother just sent me an "excited mama" #selfie. She's so hip. #HalpinsTakeTheUK
Also, see earlier tweet about "timeless music"... #BBHMM (2/2)
Finally listened to #BBHMM. Better than I was expecting based on the reception I've seen today, but seems like a weird single choice. (1/2)
Excited for my ni√ßoise salad and baguette for dinner. Tr√®s fran√ßais , non? #1weekTillFrance #Bordeaux
I haven't had a chance to listen to #BBHMM yet but based on what I've heard, I'm imagining #BirthdayCake mixed w/ #SMSbangerz. @rihanna
.@Handy just cancelled on us 30mins before our res (for a valid reason) but were unapologetic and offered nothing for the inconvenience.
My family comes to London tomorrow and it will be the first time I've seen them in 6mo. Needless to say having a hard time concentrating...
@AzButterfield she had this flamboyant gay attending to her all night. Carrying the train of her dress, etc. It was all a bit much.
@AzButterfield how was Rita? She seemed like such a bitch when I saw her working at the Brit awards. Ego didn't seem to fit the fame level.
@AzButterfield so sick of it already. How was the concert?
.@rihanna - "I want to release timeless music that feels more like me." Releases #BBHMM. SMH.
Zayn officially leaves 1D. @LookingHBO officially cancelled. Tough day to be a gay in this world. #gayboyproblems
"People on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive." I feel you @Beyonce, I feel you.
@russelltovey @LookingHBO Sad to see it go, but glad they are giving it a proper goodbye and not just writing it off without some closure.
Boo. Bye, @LookingHBO. Not happy about this. 
@AzButterfield UGH so jealous. I didn't find out about this until a couple days ago and am so pissed Im not going.
@EE Ive already called twice and been told there is nothing they can do. Just have to "wait to see if the system comes back up."
I always find it convenient when a co's system crashes they can still take your money but then are unable to do anything w/ it. @TMobileUK
@TMobileUK's entire system is down the day our smart packs expired so we are now with out texts, minutes, or data indefinitely. Good.
Why are they called water biscuits if water is not listed as one of the ingredients? Actually asking.
UGH why am I JUST finding out about this @charli_xcx concert on Wednesday now that it's sold out? I want to see #LondonQueen live in London!
Day 1 of drinking warm lemon water in the morning. Let's see how this goes...
@AzButterfield #blessed (counting a tweet as speaking)
@AzButterfield I'd rather neither. But yes, Bad Blood may be my least favourite on the album actually.
@AzButterfield Does this include T.Swift and her potential single choice?
Can we all just agree that limp handshakes are literally the worst?
I can't get over how soar my butt is from that bike ride yesterday. That'll teach me to exercise ever.
Excited to be driving on the wrong side of the road when the total eclipse hits. That won't be distracting at all. #Eclipse2015
And now a bottle of wine in bed w/ @stampepk at the hotel to end an exhaustingly great day. #MarriedLife #SHinUK #Cardiff
Just had an amazing #vegetarian Indian feast at the @VegFoodStudio for only ¬£6.95. Loving #Cardiff! 
Perfect day for a bike ride through the Welsh countryside w/ @stampepk. #Wales #SHinUK 
Anxiously awaiting our beer battered halloumi and chips @milgi w/ @stampepk. #HalloumiAddicts #Cardiff

@aurosan A fake one.
Just got a call from someone named Dan Humphrey. It took everything I had not to respond with "XOXO, #GossipGirl."
You know you work in a British office when there is an entire mini fridge for milk bottles and a hot water boiler built into the wall. #Tea
Prior to this I had literally never heard of him. I knew of @NataliaKills but I think it's a far cry to call either of them famous. (2/2)
I think that the thing that blows my mind the most is that @willymoon thinks he's famous enough for people to copy him. #xfactornz (1/2)
@AzButterfield 
@AzButterfield Who knew have styled hair and wearing a suit was a trademarked look? I guess JT owes Willy Moon an apology.
I am getting major @xtina #BackToBasic vibes from @kelly_clarkson's #BadReputation

@AzButterfield Did you choose Ground Beef as your favorite dessert? That must be it.
@AzButterfield HOW DOES BUZZFEED KNOW YOU SO WELL?!
@AzButterfield "Congratulations! You‚Äôre gnocchi. You‚Äôre hearty, delectable, and super versatile." Phew, at least I'm a good one.
@AzButterfield I need to start just drawing weird ass shit and submitting it to Buzzfeed. That's how you get famous right?
@AzButterfield No.
@AzButterfield It was good, but not my cup of tea. Eddie did an amazing job but the story itself just didn't hold my attention that much.
So nice to work close enough to home that @stampepk was able to come meet me in the park for my lunch break. #marriedlife
@tkylemac not Godney Spears?
.@ciara looks like JHud, Salma Hayek, Sherzy, Halle Berry, and Janet in this new vid. I can see all of them. 
Just watched half of #UnbreakableKimmySchmidt in one sitting. Trying to spread it out over more than one day. So great.
Am I a bad person bc I like Patrick and Kevin together? I feel like they are making his connection w/Richie more than it was. #LookingHBO
Walking to the new #job for my first day. Nervous but it feels good to be able to walk to work again, just in time for #spring.
Well that was...something. Glad we got the cheap seats in he back. #AliceInWonderland

@Danielf90 Go big or go home. #iHop #AmericaIsDisgusting 
@Danielf90 It will be the same for my fam when they visit in a few weeks but still is super confusing.
I find it incredibly confusing that the entire world does not observe #DaylightSavingTime on the same day. Why does the UK wait 2 more wks?
I thought it only rained in #London? Another #brilliant, sunny #spring day. #SHinUK 
Attempting to make #vegan barbacoa #tacos with jackfruit. If they're anything like the "pulled pork" we've made they'll be delish. #cooking

@aurosan Really with that 19yo child?
@breatheheavycom DJ Pauly D is so uncomfortable. How did he get this gig? When you make Britney seem natural in a current interview...
@DieWithoutBrit Pauly is not a great interviewer...but glad she looked so happy and animated.
Ambitious, @taylorswift13. "I'm not going to put out an album until I've made one that's better than this one." @billboard #Perfectionist
Already halfway done with @HouseofCards Season 3. I CANT STOP. #HouseofCardsSeason3
@breatheheavycom was literally listening to that song when I sent your last tweet. So good.
@MuuMuse valid. Still exciting to have the whole thing!
@MuuMuse @breatheheavycom Why is no one talking about Kelly's album leaking?! In unrelated news Britney was mentioned in House of Cards.
.@britneyspears is mentioned in #HouseofCardsSeason3. When will your faves ever? #LivingLegend
The reality of #HouseOfCardsSeason3 coming out tomorrow is finally setting in. Guess where I'll be all day tomorrow... #Netflix
@elliegoulding It was a pleasure serving you and @taylorswift13 last night at the #BRITAwards. Hope you enjoyed the champagne!
@cait1231 Cannibal cheese.
@cait1231 Can you look into this please? RT @UberFacts Human DNA can be used to create vegan cheese.
He barks hard for the money. #punny #poor #SaveUsGus 
Is this a British thing? I've never heard of this. And don't get it. At all. #EasterBread 
Officially obsessed with halloumi. Finding it when we go back to the states will no longer be an option, but mandatory. #SaltyCheeseHeaven
@Lumaloves Any current vacancies?
@AzButterfield Selena being topless doesnt make me uncomfortable. It's that she looks like a topless child.
I am literally baffled by the #SelenaGomez cover for @vmagazine. Who wants to see an American Girl Doll topless? Is it supposed to be sexy?
@breatheheavycom For someone who doesn't want to be famous she sure is cranking out these albums...
"You know that's why God gave us reflexes, so we can move the fuck out of the way when a fridge comes outta no where." Love House of Cards.
How has it been 2yrs since we picked this #CuddleMonster up from the airport? #HappyAnniversary Gus! (CC: @stampepk) 
Good God, @DiannaAgron is gorgeous in @samsmithworld's video for #imnottheonlyone. Absolutely stunning.
@MuuMuse Girl better cool it w/ those aggressive vocal runs if she doesnt want to have vocal nodules. #WhatAreYouSAYing
I understand you want to showcase your vocals when you are performing at #TheGrammys but why did every performance have to be a ballad?
@breatheheavycom @britneyspears @giorgiomoroder I would totally be here for that. Would be a really smart choice actually.
Gotta love the #spectacular 360 degree #view of the #London #skyline from the New Zealand High Commission. 
When did the word #viral go viral? I literally cannot with the internet anymore.
Scratch that. Worth staying up until 130am in #London to be a part of #superbowlrally. Well done, @britneyspears. The world was not prepared
How does @britneyspears get WWTT during the #Superbowl with her name misspelled? Brittney Spears. Really? #superbowlrally
Ridiculous that all it takes is @britneyspears to sing 2 notes &amp; I completely forget about the entire #HalftimeShowKatyPerry #SuperBowlRally
Wait but actually what is this @britneyspears #SuperBowlRally commerical?! I NEED TO GO TO BED. #SuperBowlXLIX
And now time for bed. Worth staying up until 130am in #London to be a part of it. Well done, @katyperry! #HalftimeShowKatyPerry
That lion was #BANANAS, even if it seemed like it took a sleeping pill before the show started. #HalftimeShowKatyPerry
The graphics and use of the field was amazing. #DarkHorse and the chess visuals may have been my favorite part. #KatyPerrySuperBowl
Overall great show but too predictable. Starting w/ #Roar and ending with #Firework was just too obvious for my liking. #KatyPerrySuperBowl
Hysterical that @LennyKravitz got to sing literally 15secs of @katyperry's song while @MissyElliott got 3 of her own. #KatyPerrySuperBowl
I wish @MissyElliott had been a surprise. Ruined it by knowing it was coming. But she entered in the exact way I predicted. #GetYourFreakOn
Overall production value was amazing. Lost me a bit during the beach scene but I get it. It's her schtick. #KatyPerrySuperBowl
SO many thoughts about @katyperry's #Superbowl halftime show. 1) She sounded amazing, definitely live. #impressed. 2) She looked amazing.
In search of the #Triwizard Cup w/ @stampepk, lost in a maze. #HarryPotter #GobletofFire #Muggles 
Bah is @instagram down again? Posts are going up but not showing up on feeds! #instaHELP #INeedLikes
Spent the day in Marylebone+Mayfair. Got #literary in @Dauntbooks and took in #art at @HalcyonGallery w/ @stampepk 
Nailed it: "There is a sense that 5H have simply swept up discarded ideas &amp; sounds from the cutting room floors" 
Them Girls be Like - Flawless. Like Mariah - Always Be My Baby (duh). A handful of enjoyable tracks, otherwise no thanks. #Reflection (2/2)
Over half the songs on #Reflection seem like blatant rip offs or sample pop songs. Worth It - Talk Dirty. How We Roll - Scream &amp; Shout (1/2)
So the #FifthHarmony album name drops. A LOT. Oprah. FLOTUS. Rihanna. Madonna. Beyonce. Shakira. Mariah. #Reflection
@MuuMuse I really only could handle about 5 of them. Bo$$, Sledgehamer, Worth It, Everlasting Love, We know, and Going Nowhere. #Reflection
I dont like oatmeal but loved this savory version. Easy, #healthy &amp; filling. Well played @MarthaStewart 
@ScoHay Deep breaths. I, along with every lyric website, hear long time. Perhaps it is lifetime, just doesn't make as much sense.
@breatheheavycom @kelly_clarkson Did you notice they messed up the lyrics on it though? They say "lifetime" instead of "long time." #Fail
@MuuMuse Did you see they use the wrong lyrics in the #HeartbeatSong Lyric vid? Lifetime instead of long time. #Fail 
Yea def "long time" not "lifetime." It says it multiple times. Way to go #TeamKC. May want to fix that. @kelly_clarkson #HeartbeatSong
Pretty sure @kelly_clarkson's lyric video for #HeartbeatSong has an incorrect lyric. "Haven't felt it for a lifetime"...not "long time?"
I would care a lot more about this new @rihanna if @kanyewest and @PaulMcCartney didn't already have a song togther. #FourFiveSeconds #R8
So nice to have hard work noticed and appreciated for a change. I wish all clients would do this. Seems like such a rare thing these days.

So far my prediction for this season of #theBachelor is dead on. An excess of really dumb girls to make up for Chris's lack of personality.
Miss @britneyspears makes an apperance on @billboard's Top 20 songs of the 2010's w/one of my favs, #TilTheWorldEnds 
@stampepk No I drank that last #Kronenbourg that's been in there for weeks. Pick up a few on your way if you want.

1/4 of the songs in @iTunesMusic Top200 songs have a feat. Ive said it before but remember when features were something special? #nostalgia
...And the girls in the flat above us are belting out @OfficialAdele's "Rolling in the Deep." Could this day get anymore #British? #SHinUK

@NYCRod13 one of my favorite books. I really enjoyed all of Gillian Flynns stuff and I'm not a huge reader so that says something.
@NYCRod13 have you read the book? Still WTF but it is better explained at least...
@BSchwartzUVA The whole season she just whined about how he was "too good to be true." His hometown was awful. Get. Him. Out.
So wait. Andi chose someone EXACTLY alike all of her exes and it didn't work out? I'm SHOCKED. #TheBachelorette 
But seriously I can't believe its been 3.5 years since #Stronger came out. So ready for new @kelly_clarkson in my life. #HeartbeatSong
When I saw @kelly_clarkson's new song comes out in less than a week... #HeartbeatSong 12/01/15 
Why was the first impression rose on #TheBachelor so limp and dying? Hopefully not a representation of their relationship to come.
And I think @adele and the #SpiceGirls go without saying...
Have really been embracing #BritishPop since our big move to the UK. @lilyallen @CherLloyd @LittleMix @charli_xcx #LondonQueen

Are we doing this British Christmas thing right? 
@cmlplunkett @MeganLynch I want that kale saladdddd.
@BMyChillin I got the same ones wrong.
Remember when collabs were rare so they were exciting when they happened rather than the necessary norm to get airplay? I miss those days.
Whenever I listen to @charli_xcx #SUCKER album I imagine it as the soundtrack to Clueless. Pure 90s punk pop.
Exclusive Evening Tour of #WindsorCastle tonight! #london #Christmas #Royals 
@BMyChillin RT @billboard One year after @Beyonce dropped her surprise album, how well do you know it? Take our quiz: 
Every time #Numb comes on I think its #JewelsNDrugs. Nick Jonas. Lady Gaga. Same thing right?
Listening to @kelly_clarkson's Wrapped in Red. It's finally time for Christmas music! #UKXmas
@nicksaway @stampepk Fake it til you make it! #selfpubtips
@stampepk you are?
Revisited #Red after my disdain for T.Swift had subsided recently. Still not a good album. Glad she redeemed herself with #TS1989.
"This is train number *ding ding*..." Thanks @southernrailway for that informative announcement #LGW
As always no music to too much new music all at once. @taylorswift13 #1989 @broodsmusic #Evergreen @itsmeleighton #Hearstrings

@BlackoutEgo I actually really like this album.
@MuuMuse we saw it a few days ago. Weren't fans of the play but Lilo held her own. Only one noticeable stumble...

Just realized I can go see @lindsaylohan in "Speed the Plow" since we live in London now. Tickets were immediately purchased. #pumped
@cait1231 yes but I have a feeling this American sitcom will not be available in the UK. Also was that your inaugural tweet?! #honored

Beyonce legit just sang her entire album at the #VMAs
Successfully made my first souffl√© today thanks to @inagarten. I didnt have "good" cheddar but it somehow still worked out. Fascinating
.@taylorswift13 acknowledges #1989 is a pop album. She'll somehow still get country nominations so there's that #TaylorSwiftYahooLiveStream
Aladdin followed by Tangled followed by The Little Mermaid. @stampepk and I have had a very busy Sunday. #marriedlife

3 years ago today. @britneyspears 
I hope Andi isn't a bitch to Nick. It's not weird to need/want closure that you can't have on a live tv show. #TheBachelorette
So just to be clear, @ABC flew Nick all the way to LA to see if Andi would talk to him instead of asking her in advance? #TheBachelorette
Seriously how does Andi buy into this bullshit? #TheBachelorette
Well that was the dumbest non-announcement of Chris being the next Bachelor. #TheBachelorette
1st + last time using @megabus. 30min delay both ways + now our bus seems to be broken as we are going 5mph on a highway...w/ no traffic.

Why is the quality of the @RuPaulsDragRace finale so terrible? I feel like I'm watching a VHS of a 1996 fashion show. #TeamBianca
@Jon_ALi She looks great, and this is by far my favorite from the album but yes, trying a bit too hard. Regardless, hope the song is a hit!
@billboard Britney Spears
Only @britneyspears would be credited as a guest appearance on an awards show for pre-recording one sentence. #trueicon #BBMAs
But in all seriousness @billboard didn't say "and special appearances from @taylorswift13, @RyanSeacrest", etc. Only @britneyspears #BBMAs
OMG there it was. A generic clip of nothing. @britneyspears: "I'm such a huge fan of yours." There it is folks. #BBMAs
How did no one fix @ricky_martin's collar before he went on stage? #BBMAs
That dick fringe... @theflaminglips @MileyCyrus #BBMAs
I just feel like we saw literally of these performances at the Grammys 6 months ago... @billboard #BBMAs
The noises @johnlegend's wife just made after introducing him were everything. #haeee #haeee #BBMAs
I CANNOT with all of these prerecorded "performances." #BBMAs
@BlackoutEgo it's obviously a BS award. The first female to receive the award and they chose J.Lo?
@BlackoutEgo so we can see a prerecorded clip of Britney saying how cool j.lo is, you know? #BBMAs
Love that they just showed @blakeshelton and @mikefisher1212 jamming to their wives! #BBMAs #SomethingBad

Wait @ricky_martin's #vida is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; @pitbull's World Cup song. Also he is looking fine for 42! #BBMAs
#Royals. Such a rock song... #BBMAs
@danstrauss @billboard *@KeshaRose... #bbmas
I literally cannot watch @Imaginedragons play drums one more damn time on an awards show. #BBMAs
@tkylemac agreed but let's not pretend that was a performance for the #BBMAs in any way whatsoever #prismatictourpromo
@billboard can hardly call that a performance since it was just a video of her tour...
Why is @katyperry getting straight up promo for her tour? This is just too much #BBMAs
This filmed performance of #Birthday from the #PrismaticWorldTour is unnecessary. Is Katy that hungry for a sales boost? #BBMAs
Carries looking a little skinny in the face there no? Excited for #SomethingBad #BBMAs
@BMyChillin I think she is. Just not the oooohhhhoooooohhhs
Since when are Lorde and Lana Del Rey considered Rock? #BBMAs
Can't believe our 5yr @UVA reunion is in less than a month! Hoo's going?! 
@stampepk @britneyspears ORIGINAL DOLLNEY
I love how you can listen to an unreleased @britneyspears song and tell when it was recorded... 
@BMyChillin we avoid that corner...
.@stampepk might be fun for you on Sunday? 
What is Britney Jean? 
Queen Bey we coming for you (CC: @McKinseyBond @stampepk) #OnTheRunTour @Beyonce
Officially seeing @Beyonce #OnTheRunTour this summer thanks to @Chase Pre-sales! Woot!

Congrats @carrieunderwood! High praise from @BradPaisley 
@MuuMuse An actual Birthday song I can tolerate.
Well said @DollyParton! @MileyCyrus, you can chill. Mission accomplished. #TIME100 
Easily @katyperry's best video to date. 
Seeing @mileycyrus made me so happy I grew up with @britneyspears #bangerz
Listening to nothing but @kelly_clarkson all day in honor of her birthday! #HappyBirthdayKellyClarkson
YASSSS RT @PopDaily_: New @gwenstefani album confirmed. 
Happy #birthday @stampepk! Time sure does fly...

Never have I ever left a concert at 10pm bc it was over... #BANGERZ

It's incredibly difficult to find the motivation to go and run 5mi when you've been up all night due to your psychotic dog. #gusproblems
I feel so bad for @chrisbharrison. He's trying so hard to get ANYTHING out of them and it's just radio silence. #TheFinalRose #TheBachelor
Even @GMA is having @chrisbharrison and not #JuanPablo on their show tomorrow bc no one wants to hear from JP ever again. #TheBachelor
I am so so so disappointed in Nikki. She was one of my favorites from the start. She is too smart for this! #TheBachelor

When is @MileyCyrus going to stop with the stunt antics? She's got the talent, so just stop. Makes it so hard to respect her as an artist.
So happy @britneyspears ditched the wigs last night and went au naturel for last nights #PieceOfMe show. She lokes 1,000x better! #WorkBxxCH
@stampepk GET THAT GAY STORE OWNER OUT OF HERE!
Fitting that one of the last days I have to take @wmata to work its the most miserable commute I've had in years. Can't wait to walk to work
Is @Beyonce even singing over this backtrack? #drunkinlove #TheGrammys
@MuuMuse Odd. Works on IE (who uses that?) but I get an error on Chrome. Thanks!
@MeganLynch Look! RT @gawker New anti-abortion phone app lets you pray to accomplish absolutely nothing! 
@MuuMuse Why can't we view the poll results anymore?

@Toastercf @MeganLynch I gave her a lesson months ago...
@MeganLynch wait you tweeted?
"Do you want to **** a snowman?" 
@WoodlandsVB Will the foodtruck be out and about today or is it too cold?!
@samlansky just watched their movie "Cow Belles" the other night. Needless to say I was devastated that "Like Whoa" wasn't on the soundtrack
@RCARecords Don't release ISBE as single 3 from #BritneyJean. So many better options. #TikTikBoom for single 3!
@LarryRudolph @AdamLeber ISBE only perpetuates the exisiting stereotypes about B's ability to sing. Release #TikTikBoom a surefire radio hit
@LarryRudolph @AdamLeber If you want fans to believe that #BritneyJean is an album for the die hard fans do NOT release ISBE as single 3.
@JarettSays Couldnt disagree with you more about @kelly_clarkson's #YouFoundMe. Def not "uncomfortably gloomy outlook on love" #ToEachHisOwn

Damn @britneyspears rolls deep. Even got @LarryRudolph a front row seat. #PeoplesChoiceAwards #PCAs @peopleschoice
.@britneyspears shows up and they cut to no one else but her #legend #pcas
.@heidiklum just got shifted to front row. What is she nominated for? #PCAs #PeoplesChoiceAwards @peopleschoice
Wait this Brad Paisley song is...bad. What happened to him? #IMissMudOnTheTires #WhiskeyLullaby
They haven't even name dropped @britneyspears yet. They should be doing the "up next..." teasing her presence before each commercial #pcas
They are literally rotating people in the front row so when they win they are sitting there. This show is &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   #PCAs #PeoplesChoiceAwards
.@jtimberlake left so now @britneyspears can show up? This is the most elaborate way to ensure they never see each other again ever #PCAs
.@britneyspears is clearly just showing up to accept her award then peace. No need to even give her a seat #PCAs
You can literally tell who is going to win by who is in the audience. This show... #PeoplesChoiceAwards #PCAs
Did Britney not go? I feel like they would've shown her by now considering how much they played her attendance... #PeoplesChoiceAwards #PCAs
But seriously where is @britneyspears? #PeoplesChoiceAwards #stanproblems
I had a dream I got to go to the #PCAs and @britneyspears performed with...@KaceyMusgraves?
Dear @biggestlosernbc, we know David's wife died of cancer. You don't have to remind us, multiple times per episode. #excessive #wegetit

@stampepk My results said tumor or cancer...
@breatheheavycom Ha. I literally tweeted you 2s before you sent this tweet about this.
@breatheheavycom I'm assuming your TL is blowing up about this but @britneyspears is attending the PCAs!

#WORKBXXCH is about to reenter the top 100 on @iTunesMusic. The power of the residency. Rise @britneyspears, rise. #PieceOfMe #BritneyJean
@TMZ what a bullshit story. There were multiple pictures of her singing along and having a blast.
@BMyChillin I think that's pretty standard (besides Bey). Watch any other pop star
@BMyChillin Google is hard. #lazy 
@BMyChillin billboard celebuzz and USA today all have good reviews up.
@BradySpears @iFUseeCKme it would have looked a million billion times better if it was a full body suit.
She looks like @DerrickBarry in the opening wig and costume TBH... #PieceOfMe
That opening outfit and wig though... #PieceOfMe
.@britneyspears was barefoot for half of the #OnyxHotelTour. She should ditch the heels and do it again for #PieceOfMe so her dancing slays
The dancing during #BreakTheIce gave me chills! #britney #PieceOfMe
@breatheheavycom there were 6 of us at our viewing party so that gets a few extra! Ha. And then 4 the next day...
Just got nauseous watching Miley in the #AdoreYouMusicVideoTODAY. Does anyone actually find her sexy? #smilers #vominducing #stop
@BMyChillin haha I agree. That's what all the lyrics say though

@breatheheavycom Looks good! Love freakshow. Surprised they didn't put a third from Britney Jean
@BMyChillin @Spotify Because then people wouldn't be forced to buy the entire album.
B girl ain't lost the beat 
@Britsanity Agreed. Rehearsal videos she always looks great, fingers crossed she keeps it up!

@stampepk #amballing
That beat drop at 2:17 though &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #haunted #Beyonce
@BMyChillin my rawwk
@BMyChillin 2:25 of ***Flawless
There are several songs on #Beyonce that I hear Rihanna singing. Weird.
@BMyChillin I'm sure Mine was stolen from something...that shit is...something.
@BMyChillin You mean "inspired" right?
The videos of #Beyonce are the best party by far! All so much better than a majority of the videos she's released in the past
@BMyChillin I saw the shift occur. I dont dislike it, just too many slow jam/midtempos and half the time I cant even tell a new song started
I guess I should have expected nothing less. She's a grown woman, she does whatever she wants. #Beyonce
TBH w/ the mediocre radio success of #4 I thought @Beyonce would want to come out and slay with #beyonce, not release ANOTHER artists album
Unprecedented release, slick production, only ok songs. #Beyonce
@BMyChillin but in all seriousness...why no grown woman?!
.@Beyonce You done lost yo motherfucking mind #Beyonce #WhatJustHappened?!
.@kelly_clarkson's Christmas Special was so cute and surprisingly funny! Congrats Kelly! Vocals were killer as always! #WrappedInRed

@breatheheavycom Tik Tik Boom (though not my favorite) is an obvious radio choice and yet not included...bets on it being ISBE? #britneyjean
@tkylemac Brit said she wants to collab with gaga in her web chat
If this @britneyspears @ladygaga collab happens it better be a new original song and not Brit tacked onto a track as a feat. #BritneyJean
Congrats @carrieunderwood! You sounded amazing tonight!
@britneyspears you should do this with all your albums! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears I think it's pretty unanimous that the #DreamingMix is better by far! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears just equated her fans to God. #BritneyArmy #GodSent #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears Is this one also about God? 
I can't believe @britneyspears is actually getting personal here and telling us info about each song! #BritneyJeanListeningParty
@britneyspears You should feature on her album! #BritGoesCountry #BritneyJeanListeningParty

Does anyone have a link for the full Britney Ellen interview today? #britneyjean #britneyonellen
@BradySpears Why.
Watch this GIF while listening to the chorus of #TikTikBoom &amp; imagine the possibilities of what could be 
A valid and interesting read about #BritneyJean

HOLLA! #BritneyJean is downloading finally! 
@Britsanity mine does now too. But not downloaded
@Britsanity mine is still listed as preordered :-/
@BradySpears why would it be available at 11 EST...
Passenger is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every single song on #Prism. Why did @katyperry let @britneyspears have it?! #BritneyJean for the win
@BradySpears check out the sweet promo Brit is getting on @iHeartRadio right now during the album preview... #fail 
#iHeartBritney is on now on @iHeartRadio #britneyjean album preview
Gotta love that during the @iHeartRadio album preview of #BritneyJean it said it's now playing Imagine Dragons the entire time #promofail

Experienced my first sip of Gaga stan haterade. I guess the rumors are true, Gaga fans are ruthless. Sorry I'm not sorry. CHILL THE EFF OUT
Gagas at it again, releasing the video for DWUW on the same day as #BritneyJean. Her desperation to outshine Brit is getting palpable #swine
@breatheheavycom Now that we've all heard the album what will her default answer be since she can't say "You'll have to wait and see"...?!
@britneyspears on the rise! This #BritneyJeanStreamOniTunes's impact... 
@britneyspears Been listening to the #BritneyJeaniTunesStream on repeat all day! LOVE #TillItsGone! #7DaysTillBritneyJean
#7DaysTillBritneyJean
"In the middle of a pop-princess pileup, w/ Miley/Katy/Gaga [...] Britney remains the queen who out-bangs, outbooms, out-bizarres them all"
.@RollingStone gave #BritneyJean 3.5/5 stars...the same as #InTheZone and #Blackout... high praise! 
Does the intro to #TillItsGone remind anyone else of #LikeaPrayer? #britneyjean #madonna #queensofpop
Wow #BritneyJean has two separate banners on @iTunesMusic right now. The most promo the album has ever received...
@NathanMRogers 5 listens in &amp; I stand by my original assessment except maybe Tik Tik Boom. Was hard to place. Sorry for spamming your TL ha
I have a feeling #TIKTIKBOOM is going to be single 3 but I really hope it's not. #BritneyJean
I stand by my earlier tweet. #TillItsGone &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
#BritneyJeanStreamOniTunes 
@britneyspears vocals during the verses of #TillItsGone remind me so much of something and I can't place it. Driving me nuts #BritneyJean
@MuuMuse Till its Gone &gt; Passenger &gt; Alien &gt; Work Bitch &gt; Body Ache &gt; Dont Cry &gt; Tik Tik Boom &gt; Perfume &gt; Chillin w/ U &gt; It Should Be Easy
I just picture Brit in the studio listening to #ItShouldBeEasy and saying to 
Ok #BritneyJean is MUCH better 2nd time around. still hate the vocals in It Should Be Easy feel like it's too short but overall I'm pleased
Till its Gone &gt; Alien=Passenger &gt; Work Bitch &gt; Body Ache &gt; Dont Cry &gt; Tik Tik Boom &gt; Perfume &gt; Chillin w/ U &gt; It Should Be Easy #BritneyJean
I think Till It's Gone is my favorite. A definite standout #BritneyJean
Can we also talk about how the standard edition is only 10 songs and 35mins long? #BritneyJeanStream
@britneyspears Love #BodyAche, #Alien, #Alien, #TillItsGone, and #Passenger
@BradySpears "YOURE NOT A TRUE BRITNEY FAN IF YOU DONT LIKE IT" - says every insane Britney Stan RN on my TL
@OMFGMusic tired of my TL telling me that if I don't like something I'm not a true fan. The Britney Army is out to fight!
@OMFGMusic better be careful. Apparently you have to LOVE everything an artist releases to be a TRUE fan...
I just don't get "It Should Be Easy"...autotune is one thing but this is a whole other level... #BritneyJean
Wait seriously though has @chelsealately not heard of a Lyric Video? Literally every artist does them now, but sure, hate on @britneyspears
Wowzas Miley just missed her cue hard faking those emotions. Good recovery though. And her vocals are &gt;&gt;&gt;. #WreckingBall #AMA2013
Why. Is. That. Cat. There?!?! #miley #WreckingBall #AMA2013
Yikes. Left Eye is rolling over in her grave right now... #TLC #AMA2013
...meet*
Why isn't @taylorswift13 nominated in Male Country artist? She's been in every other category even if she didn't meat the criteria #AMA2013
At least the performance was entertaining  and she looked normal for a change. #AMA2013
.@ladygaga's dancing is embarrassing. #DoWhatUWant #AMA2013
@xtina looks SKIN-NY! Damn girl. Is this the Come On Over video? #AMA2013
I still don't get why @britneyspears wont go to awards shows? Be apart of the industry you claim you want to be in @LarryRudolph @AdamLeber
JT continues to be revered for his flop album and songs...pop? R&amp;B? Soul? What's next? Best Jazz Album? #AMA2013
.@taylorswift13 continues to humble brag about how amazing she is bc all radio stations play her music... #AMA2013
I don't get why all these artists can be nominated in every genre. JT is pop. #AMA2013
For a second I thought I was watching an SNL performance. #diamonds #AMA2013 #icon? Love me some Rih but...no.
JUAN PABLOOOO #AMA2013 #bachlorette
Wait why is this happening? #RideWithMe #IsIt1999? #MustBeTheHoney #cheerios #AMA2013
Nelly should just stay on stage and sing 4x4 with @MileyCyrus. #AMA2013
Why are Florida Georgia Lines pants darker right around the crotch? Looks like he peed himself... #AMA2013
Ok but seriously @taylorswift13 should not be able to be nominated for every genre. Either pretend she's still country or only do pop. #AMAs
@OMFGMusic just said the exact same thing.
What demo is @ladygaga trying to reach with her holiday special? Geriatrics since it's feat Elton &amp; kids don't know the Muppets? #AMA2013
#FreeKesha #AMA2013
I've literally never seen Pitbull in anything other than a white suit jacket and all black. I guess that's what misogynists where? #AMA2013
It's weird to see @keshasuxx on stage and think that she's now a veteran compared all these other rookie performers. #AMA2013 #LiberateKe$ha
Taylor's dress doesn't work with that nude inlay they added since she has no chest. It would've been cuter if it was all gold. #AMA2013
Wowzas #ImagineDragons. That was...angry. #AMA2013
@tkylemac those bobby pins
Skeletor makes his return to the big stage #AMA2013
Why is @jtimberlake winning awards this  year? Every single except #mirrors flopped hard #AMAs
@MuuMuse Kelly's "People Like Us" meets  Lindsay's "Rumors" meets Britney's "Work Bitch"

I actually like #ItTakesTwo except that she says "It takes two"...otherwise it's good. #Prism #katycats #ParentTrap 
Like I'm sorry but #InternationalSmile, #ChooseYourBattles...the Hallmark card lyrics are KILLER. Color me #disappointed #prism #katycats
I want to like #prism when I hear the beats but the lyrics are so generic/cliche I just can't. #LegendaryLovers #DoubleRainbow #itTakesTwo
@tkylemac See my earlier tweet: 
Ok so I like the snippets but seriously after this album can we be done with will.i.cant? Im sick of BEP rejects showing up on #BritneyJean
@idolator @britneyspears Better than My Baby...
Pre-order Britney Jean on iTunes...even if it is leaking right now! #BritneyJean
@davidhanna yeaaa it's gonna be rough.
@Britsanity 150k maybe. This fall is not being nice to pop sales.
@davidhanna yikes. BTW backlash in full swing. Should've sold it for $0.01 again. Hopefully we won't be eating our words with #BritneyJean
@davidhanna what are the numbers?
@MuuMuse I get that its all about Vegas but I don't get why that means there can be zero album promo. Or why shes releasing an album at all?
See what happens when you don't sell your album for $0.99 @ladygaga "@chartnews: US chart preview: @ladygaga 250-275k (debut).‚Äù
#jhps #saba "@stampepk: This place is incredible! #honeymoon 
@stampepk stop tweeting and get back down here! #jhps
"I would love to know the algorithm that tells you your best friends on @Snapchat" - @stampepk my husband as of tomorrow #jhps
@stampepk Does that mean the obnoxious "we <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏èPSL" signs are finally gone?!
@MuuMuse @AvrilLavigne I gotta say I love this album. And #GiveYouWhatYouLike is amazing. #AvLav #NeverGrowUp
It's crazy that there are 4 versions of #BritneyJean available...Makes projecting its success very difficult.
#BritneyJean is #1 in 18 countries WW so far! #BritneyJeanPreOrder Congrats @britneyspears
No banner ad on @iTunesMusic for @britneyspears #Perfume or #BritneyJeanPreOrder. Why am I not surprised?
After a few listens I can officially say #Perfume is outstanding. I'm sure people will hate on it since it's Britney but this is a smash.
@BradySpears how do you even compare tbh
@britoholic that promo
Holy shit. #perfume is amazing. Her best vocals possibly ever 
@Britsanity that snippet made me nervous. Hopefully it's just bc it's LQ
@OMFGMusic G.U.Y.
@Toxic_Ego probably because it is incredibly generic and immature yet will spawn 10 massive hits and get a Grammy nom #overrated
Pop music as it stands in 2013: ARTPOP &gt; Avril Lavigne &gt; Stars Dance &gt; BANGERZ &gt; DEMI &gt; Prism (I'm not even ranking 20/20 experiences)
I forgot BANGERZ...doesn't bode well for Miley
But clearly #BritneyJean &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
As much as it pains me to say it I think this is my rating for pop music 2013 this far: ARTPOP &gt; Avril Lavigne &gt; Stars Dance &gt; DEMI &gt; Prism
@MuuMuse It's MUCH better than I expected. I was not here for #Venus or #Applause but overall much better than BTW. #ARTPOP
From the little I've listened to ARTPOP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW
@Toxic_Ego don't be jealous. I have snapchat and added her immediately after her tweet and she didn't add me back so I saw it all on twitter
#PerfumeSingleCover via @Snapchat  @britneyspears 
@britoholic the pressure to get that screen capture has never been so great! #Perfume
@britoholic who's getting these?!
@britoholic its prob Adam and Larry sending dick pics to each other
@jakebley wait I'm obsessed with Summer Heights High and your costume slash impressions are amazing.  #dead #WheresMrG
@stampepk Ew. #SodaStream
The first two singles excluded @AvrilLavigne has really shown growth as an artist with #AvrilLavigne. #GiveYouWhatYouLike is amazing. #AvLav
I still don't get how #WorkBxxCHVideo only has 38M views on @youtube. It's the best @britneyspears video in years. #poorshowing
Think it's safe to say #WorkBxxCH is #dead. Shocking that radios didn't want to play a song that says b**ch 800 times...#ReadyForPerfume
@stampepk At least CROWDED was accepted! 39/350+ is awesome and means at least someone thought you had a good pitch! #AgentTreat
@Britsanity Lotus and Bionic got a higher ratings than Stripped...so theres that.
Honestly, why is she chosing questions that she won't answer. This is the biggest waste of time. #YoullHaveToWaitAndSee
@britneyspears Did you love the UVA campus when you visited there a few months ago? Isn't it beauitful? #AskBritneyJean
Still impossibly vague but our first almost answer of the night! RT @britneyspears @WorkBitchTaco Hmmmm... been thinking about it ;)
@BradySpears @britneyspears You'll have to wait and see ;)
She literally hasn't answered a single question. If given two options she always chooses both.
@britneyspears Fans are dying to learn something new about the new album! Can you tell us something we havent heard before? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Tell your fans one thing we don't already know about the upcoming album! #AskBritneyJean
@davidhanna You'll have to wait and see ;)
Britney is KILLING me with these generic answers.
@britneyspears When will you perform #WorkBxxCH for the first time live? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Are the boys going to dress up as 2 of the 7 dwarves?! #AskBritneyJean And @hannahspears can dress up too!
@britneyspears Now that Breaking Bad is over, what TV shows do you plan on watching? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Can fans expect any #BritneyJean promo? TV performances? Song snippets? We're dying to hear it! #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears What was the inspiration for the #BritneyJeanAlbumCover? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears You've said you would like to try acting again in the future. Would you ever consider hosting #SNL? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Are there any producers you haven't worked with yet that you are dying to work with? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Who is your dream collaboration? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Do you plan to ever perform at any awards shows again in the future? They just aren't the same without you! #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears Will you be performing any previous songs that were not singles in Vegas? #AskBritneyJean
@britneyspears what is the favorite song you've recorded that was not released as a single? #AskBritneyJean
#AskBritneyJean #1 TT WW! People are ready for the Q&amp;A @britneyspears! Let's do this!
@davidhanna IGOOFFWITHTHAT
@stampepk I'm stanning for CROWDED real hard. #AgentTreat
@MuuMuse Don't you think Twitter is to blame for a vast majority of this? #Anonymity makes talking smack so much easier. #Spineless #Haters
@OutrageousBSFan You've got enough to chose from...
God #Venus is terrible. It's too bad @ladygaga changed the 2nd single to DoWhatUWant...she could've had another #flop on her hands #artpop
Wait, this new @AvrilLavigne is actually great. Pleasantly surprised. #AvrilLavigne #AvLav #hellokitty
#BritneyJeanAlbumCover TT WW. Congrats @britneyspears #ReadyForPerfume
In yet another (work)bitch DGAF move, @britneyspears drops the album cover for #BritneyJean gimmick free. #queen #HBIC
"I am a performer. I am a Mom. I am funny. I am your friend...I am Britney Jean." 
#BritneyJeanAlbumCover
@BMyChillin It's a career...not a job! #Bodos4Eva
I've been playing the #workbxxchvideo all day and the playcount has not gone up once. Even when I refresh the page. What gives @YouTube
Why don't @britneyspears tweets show up on my timeline a lot?! I see RTs from other stans before hers half the time... @twitter #WORKBxxCH
Wowzas. @BuzzFeed spills the #truth tea about @katyperry's #prism 
Amazing article with the Director of the BOMT Music Video 
@davidhanna it's...fine.
#Prism is released and @ladygaga announces her (new) 2nd single. #ShadeMonster #ARTPOP
@nicksaway look you're not the only one! "@tkylemac: Just watched World War Z and now I don't want to step foot outside.‚Äù
#duffin? More like #muffnut @Starbucks #duffingate
Not feeling #Prism...not gonna lie. I'm sure it'll slay the charts and Katy will get 7 more #1s from it though... #GenericPop #DrLukeFactory
#Prism leaked but my computer is being fixed at the Apple Store. #FirstWorldProblems
Nice try @google #google #fail 
Oh my. Zac Efron. Naked. 
Woo Britney Jean is TT WW. Time to do #WORKBxxCH #BritneyJean #120313
#BritneyJean
#BritneyJean #120313
@Popjustice vanilla candles and Christmas potpourri
20/20 Experience 2 of 2 is so much better than Part 1. Songs are still way too long but generally less repetitive and more lyrical #JT
Had to unfollow @britneyspeans because of the continuous NSFW content with absolutely no warning. Really with that vine?!
@britneyspeans bow down.
@MuuMuse 5
@stampepk whoa.
#WORKBxxCHVideo is #1 on iTunes with the song on the rise from #26 to #8. Want a #1? You better #BUYWorkBxxChOnITUNES @britneyspears
The burping robots and Miley rapping really ruin #SMS #BANGERZ
Has anyone counted how many times Mike Will Made It is said on #BANGERZ yet?
@britneyspeans Any idea if watching on a video loop site counts it each time it starts?
@britneyspeans Maybe thats why she's slaying...bc she's appealing to the crazy children with mommy and daddys visa attached to their Itunes
@MuuMuse @britneyspears omg.
Dead. RT @britneyspears Go call the po-lice, Go Call The Gu-vunah! Someone tell Congress to get to #WORKBxxCH
@britneyspeans Infinite loop. Set. Go.
@britneyspears Still in disbelief at how amazing this video is. You got to #WORKBxxCH. #speechless
Anyone else get Sweet Dreams Interlude video vibes from the Circus Tour? Britney Spears - Work B 
Time to climb the charts. This video is literally everything the #BritneyArmy could have hoped for. @britneyspears did #WORKBxxCH
Time to get to #WorkBxxch. Time to stream. Nonstop. 
Literally. Dead. 
#WorkBxxchTonight TT WW....9 mins and counting. Go call the police, go call the govunah
WORKBxxCHVideo #InGodneyWeTrust 
Really with this? #KatyCats are not messing this era. These songs aren't even that good...America loves generic pop 
@davidhanna True. Currently streaming #WORKBxxCH on vevo like i have been for the past two weeks...my itunes playcount will be so skewed!
@davidhanna We do love voting...not doing so great on the streaming and trending recently... #WorkBxxchVideo
@davidhanna Miley is the center of everyone's attention right now and then got naked on a wrecknig ball...I stan hard for Brit but...
@britneyspeans I was angrily tweeting her team during the HIAM premiere bc I was so diasspointed. Really hope that doesnt happen tonight.
It's embarrassing to be an #American working at the #Canadian Embassy right now...not gonna lie. #govtshutdown
Ugh 6 more hours...why is the premiere so late?! #WorkBxxchVideo
@tkylemac @VEVO Britney breathing is totally GIF worthy...idk what youre talking about... Someone was too lazy to #WORKBxxCH
@britneyspears #WorkBxxchVideoToday!!!
Police "Do not cross" tape at certain entrances to the RHOB. #classy #murica #govtshutdown
Could you imaging being a tourist and having travelled all this way to see DC to find out every attraction is closed?! #govtshutdown #embarr
The only boundaries @MileyCyrus is pushing is seeing how uncomfortable she can make her fans without losing her entire fanbase. #Smilers
Wait. Im sorry. Who is calling #BANGERZ the #Blackout of this decade? That has to be a joke right?
WORK BITCH MUSIC VIDEO - 9:34pm ET on the @CW_network, 9:40pm on @VEVO #WorkBxxchVideo
#WorkBxxchVideoTomorrow
Best part of Bangerz is @britneyspears's vocals on the song. That tells you how the song actually is... #SMS #BANGERZ  #SomethingMoreUrban
@breatheheavycom would be much better without miley actually. Her voice just doesn't work for this song.
Um how does Avril Lavigne have 3 worldwide trending topics right now...seems excessive. Even if it is her bday. #HappyBirthdayAvrilLavigne
#WorkBxxCHVideoPremiere Oct 1st on @CW_network
@tkylemac Surprise? What era hasn't been a mess since ITZ?
@MuuMuse @britneyspears @CW_network You better work work.
#WorkBxxCHPremiere Tuesday, Oct 1st!
#WorkBxxCHVideoPremiere @britneyspears
@tkylemac I think if prefer that to the half assed dancing in HIAM
@tkylemac they said the exact same thing about HIAM. #nervous #youbettaworkb
God this video needs to drop ASAP. 
@britneyspeans I don't get it. It's only been 8 years...
@tkylemac Ha. I don't think so. A failed attempt at being clever?
@breatheheavycom Lynne said she reads the site to @LarryRudolph! #amazing #almostfamous 
Did #Cher use the same wig as the #LuckyMagazine cover shoot with @britneyspears? #CloserToTheTruth
#WORKBxxCH debuts at #12 on the @billboard Hot 100. Time for the #WORKBxxCHVideo @brtinyespears @LarryRudolph @AdamLeber
@OMFGMusic kind of ruined by her admitting she's crying about her dog that died...
Twitter got #hacked. If you get a DM from me don't click the link. Changes password... @twitter
@breatheheavycom did you like the interview? Are you excited she seems more herself these days?
@britneyspeans a way better makeup artist
@TMZ what a dumb article. As if @britneyspears has any idea what companies she has stock in. She pays someone to do that.
#PieceOfMeTickets is trending WW. Congrats @britneyspears
Haha oh Brit. Talking about &amp;impersonating the gays...priceless.  
@MuuMuse @tkylemac @breatheheavycom @britneyspears Super jeal. Can't wait to read your reviews and eventually get out there myself!
#CoolBeans
8min wait at U St for green/yellow during rush. Reasonable @wmata @unsuckdcmetro
"Spears‚Äô Las Vegas residency show is being directed by award-winning lighting and touring director Baz Halpin" WHY AM I NOT RELATED TO HIM?
@britneyspears better #GetToWORKBxxCH and do some promo or release the vid stat if she doesn't want #WORKBxxCH to be DOA
@househusbraden I GOT iOS7!!!! 
@Slate @jbryanlowder really disrespectful article.
#roar just passed #WORKBxxCH on @iTunesMusic...time for some actual promo @britneyspears #YouBettaWorkB
Things are not looking good for nabbing that #1 spot on@iTunesMusic #WORKBxxCH #BuyWorkBxxchOniTunes @britneyspears 
@MuuMuse I've prepared myself for no performance...
@MuuMuse album title and Vegas residency?
#BritneyOnGMA #PlanetBritney #WORKBxxCH
@britneyspeans you must have tailored trends? I don't see that or Britney Spears trending? #WORKBxxCH
@OMFGMusic I'm going to be upset when she doesn't perform
@britneyspeans how do you have all these pics when it hasn't aired yet?
Is Miley Cyrus seriously going to stop the #BritneyArmy from getting #WORKBxxCH to #1 on @itunesmusic? #Unacceptable #GetToWORKBxxCH
@britneyspears Up to 41 countries now! Congrats on a worldwide smash! #WORKBxxCH Now get to work bitch!
.@britneyspears should encourage fans to buy as many copies of #WORKBxxCH for a chance to win a trip with her...oh wait @ladygaga did that
Oh shit, @britneyspears is gunning for that #1 spot on @itunesmusic. Just bumped out #Roar for the #2 spot, next up Miley. #WORKBxxCH
@OMFGMusic I just hope its not all spoken. The best parts of #WORKBxxCH are the parts where she actually sings.
@OMFGMusic Agreed. I just remind myself he was behind The Dutchess and hope for the best.
@OMFGMusic Better than your original response...
@OMFGMusic @britneyspears Pleased with it as a single but hope the entire album will not be like this.
Having my 1 year review today at work. #GetToWORKBxxCH
#WORKBxxCH is climbing the @itunesmusic charts already! #4 in US #WORKBxxCHoniTunes @britneyspears
Britney Spears is still the #1 WW TT. You betta #WorkBxxCH! #WorkBxxCHOniTunesTonight
Go call the police <ONCOMING POLICE CAR> go call the gov-a-nah <OLDER MAN> #WORKBxxCHPremiere
Amazing that I've spent my entire day focused on one thing and one thing only, #WORKBxxCHPremiere SPREAD THE WORD #WorkWorkWork
@britneyspears love it but hope the entire album is not like this! #WORKBxxCHPremiere
That so-called "LQ" version sounded identical to what was just on @iHeartRadio. Why do they always pretend its going to be diff #WORKBxxCH
Say its just LQ, you're a little liar @britneyspears. Have a feeling it won't sound much different just like the #OohLaLa "Demo"#WORKBxxCH
@britneyspears I still cant believe it didnt leak sooner! 36hrs out is impressive. #WORKBxxCH
@tkylemac Just have to change your expectations. It's not like anything she's done before, which is good. But not the traditional Brit song.
#WORKBxxCH is officially replacing #ScreamAndShout on the wedding playlist. (CC: @stampepk @britneyspears)
#WORKBxxCH has leaked. I got chills listening to it and it has me and @stampepk dancing in bed at 8am on Sunday. Well done @britneyspears
#WORKBxxCH #2daysalleyesonbritney
Wahhh how was #WorkBitch not leaked yet! They have this shit on lockdown! #desperate #need #want #now #workb #2daysalleyesonbritney
@Popjustice Kate Boy - The Way We Are
@breatheheavycom I am so impressed/shocked that nothing has leaked this era. No photos. No music. Dying with anticipation. #WorkB
SMH at all these so called Britney Stans tweeting @Popjustice asking what #EDM is... #WorkB
@Popjustice Please tell us it does not sample RuPaul!
Wait. @britneyspears is on the Corner at @UVA?! Why could this not have happened during the 4 years I was there?!?! #britneystanproblems
Thankful that @stampepk didn't propose to me via flashmob in a @homedepot
@tkylemac Better than any of the Femme Fatale era fonts IMO. The way they wrote "Britney Spears" was atrocious. #WorkB
Bitch DGAF! #YouBettaWorkB RT @britneyspears 4 days people! Go call the Po-Lice! Go call the Governor! #WorkB 
@ClayReese RT ‚Äú@MuuMuse: photos of a girl in long dress in a desert are Blake Lively

@stampepk @LoveItorListIt I think the online application says "Are you an insufferable bitch?"
@MuuMuse  #PutTheTongueAwayMiley
@jakebley Minus the sledge hammer licking I agree. #PutTheTongueAwayMiley
@OMFGMusic Work Bitch instagram.
@JustJared Could have done without her licking that sledge hammer but otherwise well done. #WreckingBall

@Jon_ALi Could have done without her licking that sledge hammer but otherwise well done. #WreckingBall
Wait. Dead. RT @britneyspears: #WorkBitch 
Excited to see @maroon5 (for the 1st time) &amp; @kelly_clarkson (for the 4th time) tonight @ #JiffyLubeLive. #stronger #catchmybreath #tieitup
@MuuMuse time will tell. I just hope she's not hopping on the hashtag bandwagon
@MuuMuse I meant just the title. Clearly I think it'll sound amazing. I just think the title sounds more in your face the Brit typically is
@MuuMuse not gonna lie, I really hope this isn't true.
Wait, I'm sorry #23 is not the song as #Twerk? They sound exactly the same to me. And I can't even recognize @mileycyrus in either #popbust
@breatheheavycom God I hope not.
#werk
Sorry but that @nsync reunion/performance/what ever the hell you want to call it was #weak #vmas #mtv #itsnotthesuperbowlJT
I'm loving being #engaged at the same time as @kelly_clarkson so I have even more of an excuse to play #TieItUp on repeat. #nowplaying

#hypocrite #applause
"But this impromptu chart showdown is a sign that she may have completely lost her grasp on casual mainstream fans." 
#Desperation at its best. Only #LittleMonsters are this crazy... 
@tkylemac love. This.
@breatheheavycom blah such mixed feelings about this.
Amazing article by @billboard about @ladygaga's #Applause &amp; @katyperry's #Roar. Couldn't agree more. 
#Roar #FTW @katyperry
#Roar is beating out #applause right now on @iTunesMusic. Here's hoping this is a sign of things to come for Gaga's new era #secondratepop
@MuuMuse 3
@MuuMuse Super cute. Almost makes me forget that it is song my Sara Bareillas...oh wait.
This article explains exactly how I feel about Gaga. #exhausted 
Ugh @MileyCyrus #Bangerz #StopTryingSoDamnHard

Apparently you can cook and present terribly all season then do well once and get to make it to the network. #FoodNetworkStar
We get it @altonbrown, you think Nikki doesn't show authority. She was the best person on this show. You continue to disappoint.
@FoodNetwork Rodney and Russell both should have been gone forever ago. Russell has no POV. Rodney can't speak. You need a veggie show.
@FoodNetwork no this season has been terrible. It's clear the "mentors" have no clue how to do this without Bob and Susie

@breatheheavycom Correction: fifth harmony DOES name drop Britney &amp; Demi Too bad they shade her so much yet are using her name for success
@breatheheavycom does #fifthharmony name drop @britneyspears in their new promo single "Me and my Girls" before bieber and 1D?
@breatheheavycom I really hope this doesn't happen. Brit can't sell 1Mil in first week sales anymore and will miss out on another No.1
.@britneyspears @Sia #epic. Cannot wait for #Album8. Brit is coming to slay. I am so in love with this collab.

@breatheheavycom Very minor production differences. Feels a bit slower and her vocals seem a bit less skewed.
#OohLaLaToday
Love @britneyspears tweeting fans! She followed me after the #FemmeFataleTour &amp; I died. Can only imagine what getting a tweet would be like!

@MuuMuse Just wish she hadnt hyped it so much. She set expectations way too high I think. Its catchy, was just hoping for a Cant Be Tamed!
@MuuMuse Great review. Agree.
@MuuMuse I still think that...

Not sure how its taken this long to leak..: ‚Äú@PopDailyNet: Grown Woman 
Justin Bieber stop trying to make dropped crotch pants happen, they're not going to happen! #BBMA
@OMFGMusic that implies beyonce will actually release something rather than continuing to just promote herself #dontholdyourbreath
@OMFGMusic Still into You - Paramore probs
@BMyChillin She's a grown woman. She can do whateva she waaants. But seriously. Era over before it begins. #womp
@BMyChillin #shock
@BMyChillin that would imply we would get new music ever and clearly that ain't happening #OohLaLa
@Diana_Doody Yummo!
@MuuMuse skinny lotus
@BMyChillin Don't feel guilty. They're made of fruit right? #lies
@amandajleech who cares tonight was a success!
@MuuMuse haha love that song
@MuuMuse We'll be saying the same thing when @britneyspears releases a video for #OohLaLa with an excessive # of clips from Smurfs2 #pray
@Jon_ALi Ugh, so good! I miss these days!
Only 2 days left until I run for #TeamCanada in the #Komen #RaceForTheCure 
#NP #DEMI...so much better than #Unbroken. Well done @ddlovato
@MuuMuse @britneyspears Love the mention of Come on Over...
@MuuMuse Looks like Xtina during the Come On Over video. #LotusPromo
Wait, can someone honestly explain to me why @Beyonce STILL hasn't released #GrownWoman but continues to perform it on the #MrsCarterTour?
Only thing #beautiful is missing is more @MariahCarey and a bridge. And I could do without the hashtag let's be honest... #np #comeback
@cait1231 I'm glad you've never tweeted by @DcHipHopEvents is following you... #gangsta #thuglife
@MuuMuse @speriod Wait look how skinny she was. I cant.
@MuuMuse Blind faith in the Holy Spearit
@MuuMuse Have to cling onto something! And who knows, maybe if Will doesnt touch the songs it'll be ok. We can dream (within a dream) right?
@MuuMuse yea. Just could have done without the "I wear cool clothes to express myself bc pharrell told me I'm cool enough."
@amandajleech @stampepk Mileys an adult yall...so dope. 
@MuuMuse regardless I'm excited for the new music. I'm sure it'll be "dope"
@MuuMuse I felt like that interview was so forced. And her dropping the curse words were like "yea I'm an adult, see, I say shit a lot."
#TruthTea RT @billboard When Beyonce's inspiration turns into imitation ‚Äì Op-Ed by @3rika:

@itskittibitch it doesn't start for another 25 mins...
@breatheheavycom Looks like we've got another fixer-upper on our hands like Jason.
Great to hear shes not the robot everyone claims she is "Will: The "Scream &amp; Shout" Accent Was Britney's Idea" 
@breatheheavycom YASSS.
@Bethenny No one else is reporting it.
@MuuMuse SAY! Love that she's tweeting out fanmade covers. Only xtina. #LotusPromo
@KateMitchell23 Looks like your tweeting up a storm.
@amandajleech OMG I want the mango lip smackers
Once again amazed at the power of @britneyspears. Only took 30 mins to get #OohLaLa to trend worldwide. Never been so excited for the Smurfs
@BMyChillin @sdhiggins yeaaa. That's the problem and the other thing I learned from "Life is but a Dream"
@BMyChillin I feel like her doc was justifying 4 though it didnt do well commercially &amp; now this tour is going to be the tour she didnt have
@BMyChillin so @Beyonce has started the tour and still no new music?
Already a long week and it's only Monday...
@BMyChillin having watched her documentary I am in no way surprised. She only cares about her "art," not her fans.
@BMyChillin prob a fan. At least it had some new segment of the song? Haha
@BMyChillin @sdhiggins that's just footage from the behind the scenes of the Pepsi commercial
@BMyChillin How has it not leaked yet...

I have never seen anyone chug #Pepsi &amp; not immediately let out a massive belch. @Beyonce is better than us in every way #GrownWoman #BeyHere
@HannahAron #shavasana
@breatheheavycom hard to compare since Brits is way more a Pepsi commercial while Beys is just promoting her new single basically.
I guess Timbalanad is relevant again. I feel like we've all gone back to 2007... #GrownWoman
Well done, Bey. Now just drop that single already. #GrownWoman


@BMyChillin Just a pepsi commercial.
@breatheheavycom I hope this is a sad April Fools Joke
Was @taylorswift13 ahead of the game supporting #MarriageEquality by naming her album #Red? That would be giving her way too much credit...
@amandajleech Any cardinal direction would be acceptable I think.
#HappyBirthdayFemmeFatale
@MuuMuse Shes missing a piece of the puzzle and this time she knows she's in trouble... #ItsColdInTheDesert
@MuuMuse Having Sherzy be the pharaoh was a nice surprise..I would have guessed Legendtina. SAY! #InGodneyWeTrust

Gus is loving his first @getbarkbox and his #HarryBarker bone. #puppy #instagram 
@OMFGMusic @jtimberlake #LetTheGrooveIn and #Mirrors for sure

@BMyChillin finally got some new material. #BowDown
@BMyChillin Looks like @Beyonce missed your ultimatum tweets. "2013: The Year Beyonce Promoted Her Own Existence And Nothing Else"

Wait. I am the same as @britneyspears now. Look at that #Maltese...it needs to be friends with #Gus! 
I'm betting you're right, @MuuMuse @breatheheavycom
I love my ball! #love #puppy #obsessed #photooftheday 
So #photogenic #love #guspic #instagood 
@amandajleech especially when they are coated in dried potatoes? How's the beta?
Scream &amp; Shout now TT WW. @britneyspears @iamwill #ScreamAndShoutRemixVideo
#ScreamAndShoutRemixVideo
Is @PerezHilton turning the corner on @ladygaga &amp; realizing that her Little Monsters are literally the worst fans out there? #SeeTheLight
LOVE. RT @MuuMuse I made pop-themed Valentine's Day cards for @Idolator. Go look!
Will @ladygaga's dancing be affected like @britneyspears's after her knee surgery? Oh wait Gaga was never a good dancer so it will be fine.
@MuuMuse @JessicaSimpson I always thought that @MileyCyrus's Hoedown Throwdown paid homage to that... #HannahMontana
Shock. @britneyspears did something first. In this case 9 years ago.
@MuuMuse this is amazing
God it smells like wet dog on this bus #WMATA
@MuuMuse I don't get why @britneyspears doesn't even go. She needs to start being a more active participant in the music community.
Sad @kelly_clarkson didn't get to present the Grammy to her best friend @mirandalambert #Grammys
Yay! Congrats @kelly_clarkson! So well deserved #Grammys
I forgot how much @carrieunderwood loves God. #Grammys
Get #LLCoolJ out of here. #WorstHostEver #Grammys
What does @hannahspears have to say about @britneyspears's newest addition?!
#Vegasney

(Some things never change)
Appetizers made. Beyonc√©/Desitny's Child playlist created. Ready for @Beyonce Bowl!!! #SuperBowl2013
I'm not cocky, I just love myself, BITCH. #vanity #bionic
@RealBRITannica @emilyvontom @britneyspears @ItsBritney False. 
I'm attending ASLA Green Instagram Contest, Live Tweetup  
@Sara_Gilliam Wait. What. No. Who actually uses that?!
The problem with sleeping in on a Sunday? Not being able to fall asleep that night when you have to get up to go to work early on Monday
@MuuMuse then they'd have to call it the Femme Fatale remix...oh wait.
@britneyspears @iamwill @hit_boy @iamdiddy @wakaflockabsm @liltunechi Remix = completely new song
@MuuMuse Maybe we'll get a whole Britney verse. Oh wait, that would involve them giving the fans something they actually want for a change.
@MuuMuse @NicoleScherzy Amazing. Just laughed out loud at work at this.
.@davidchang seems like a really pretentious douchebag. Actually all the judges tonight do except Michelle and Tom. #TopChef
Judges on this ep of @BravoTopChef are intolerable. They are being so caddy &amp; rude. They haven't said a single constructive thing. #TopChef
There's a storm coming Mr Wayne
@BMyChillin It's...fine.
I'm more upset about Britney and Jason breaking up than I am about her leaving @TheXFactorUSA
@moremichael Isnt there an app for that?
@BMyChillin Better not listen to Tracy Chapman...
@BSpearsDaily sooo it didn't miss the Top 100?
@BSpearsDaily UGH. ENOUGH with will i am already
@BSpearsDaily How is that possible? It was #12 last week and digital sales were up 99%...
We in the car. We ride slow. We doin things that the girls don't do.
@stampy423 ‚Äú@PerezHilton: It's time to stop your "holiday eating" when... Your poop almost clogs the toilet because it is King Kong size!‚Äù
@TophKlein and shitting all over her name.... #ItsKristen
#WeLoveYouCarly
Fucking America. #TateForTheWin... He thanked the man upstairs...clearly thats why American loves him. God I hate this country.
Mario said "True Star" and Khloe changed outfits! My night is complete! #OMGXFFINALE
Till The World Ends!!!
YASSSS! @carlyrosemusic singing #TheClimb #OMGXFFINALE
@MuuMuse I spent 100% of that performance confused why people find Harry attractive.
I don't get why everyone is obsessed with Harry. He is the least attractive by far. #1DonXFactorFinale
@itskittibitch No because she didn't have an act left to perform. They showed each judges before their contestant went... Pobre Demi
WAIT. #CarlyForTheWin has disappeared from the WW trends but Tate is moving up...WHAT IS HAPPENING?! #OMGXFFINALE
Literally every single Pitbull song sounds EXACTLY the same. No wonder he's popular. God I hate pop music these days.
Khloe should prob change her outfit again because its her last chance. She'll clearly never be a host again in her life... #XFactorFinale
#CarlyForTheWin has been a TT WW for almost two days now. If she doesnt win I cant. America never gets it right. I hope they do this time...
#CarlyRoseXF #CarlyForTheWin
So glad I'll never have to hear #FifthHarmony screaming in reaction to something ever again. #XFactorFinale
THANK GOD. My heart is racing! #SeeYouNeverFifthHarmony #XFactorFinale
Whoa! Costume change for Khloe! #XFactorFinale
CarlysAngels were normal and sweet. The only tolerable Special Message of the night. #XFactor #CarlyForTheWin
OH SHIT! Carly Rose singing All I Want For Christmas is You! #CarlyForTheWin I bet the #FifthHarmony girls were PISSED they didn't get it
Whoa @britneyspears crying for #FifthHarmony...wtf
If Fifth Harmony wins this I hope the world actually does end tomorrow so we don't have to hear their music...ever. #XFactor
Wow 6 of the WW TT topics are for #XFactorFinale! #CarlyForTheWin
California Hamster Association is upset that @JustinBieber gave away his hamster to a fan, says its animal cruelty...really?! Get a life.
#CarlyForTheWin
If @britneyspears doesn't say "I think we found a true star!" tonight this is all for nothing! #xfactor #TrueStarney
Holiday presents @stampy423 and I made for colleagues and staff! 
I love getting up at 530am on a Sunday to catch a flight home...
It reeks of marijuana and BO on this train
#ImNotHappyXF but at least @carlyrosemusic is still in the competition! #XFactor
Maybe if Drew weren't such a douche @emblemthree would have made it instead of @fifthharmony #XFactor
THANK. FUCKING. GOD. My heart is RACING. #XFactor #CarlyRose Still pissed about Fifth Harmony
#XFNO
Wait ss @carlyrosemusic going home?! I don't understand America. She is going to be the next @OfficialAdele WTF is wrong with you?! #XFactor
CANNOT believe @fifthharmony is going on to the finals. They had their first good performance of the entire competition last night #XFactor
OMG @britneyspears face after @fifthharmony lost their shit. #priceless #xfactor #GIFimmediately
@OMFGMusic Britney?
I really thought the category was going to be Favorite Gay Actor... #PCA 
#savechefkuniko
I'm voting to #savechefkuniko in this week's @bravotopchef Save A Chef competition. How about you? 
Jewel is releasing a GH album and she rerecorded FoolishGames w/ @kelly_clarkson and YouWereMeantForMe with the Pistol Annies. #Perfection
@TophKlein See the sunlight we ain't stoppin
@OMFGMusic remember that time it was nominated for a Grammy? #Vomit
Super excited to run an 8k in the cold and rain... Oh wait.
@OMFGMusic pirate bay
Glad we've seen three trains go in the opposite direction but not a single to DC. #FuckWMATA
Stuck inside a god damn @wmata stop waiting for a train that will never come but I can't leave or I will be charged more than if I took home
@stampy423 @wmata Fuck WMATA. Glad it's the most expensive metro system and 100% the least reliable.
Really @wmata? Online trains listed at 2,7and 20mins. Run into the station to see -- and 16. Should've taken a cab
@PerezHilton @TheXFactorUSA Her name is Carly ROSE not Carly Rae...
@LauraUDDC27 @dcist Ugh I want to but would be too scared! You're not the first to send this to me...
@stampy423 I see you are now following @hannahspears...good call.
@breatheheavycom Not nearly as bad as the headline makes it appear...
@MuuMuse @Joda308 That purple Power Rangers shirt. That form.
@MuuMuse For me as well... 
Wait @hannahspears only weighs 1.8lbs. #Dead
Why is @TheXFactorUSA determined to make this the shortest competition show ever with double eliminations each week?! It's ridiculous.
#BritneyIsQueen
Britney is the Queen of Pop #xfactor
@BSchwartzUVA must be a pretty long tail
@BSpearsDaily Any airplay updates for #ScreamAndShout?
@wmata smells like rotten fish and burning rubber this morning. Hope I don't vom in the 5 mins it takes for a train to get here
#HappyBirthdayBritney
I say #savechefchrissy in this week's @bravotopchef poll.  What do you say?  
#ProudToBeAFanOf @britneyspears. Happy Birthday Britney Spears
#HappyBirthdayBritney  (tomorrow)
Remember that time @vinoalan went home on @TheXFactorUSA last night! Too great. #DreamsDoComeTrue
.@britneyspears named the top earning female musician of 2012! 
GODNEY answered my prayers #byevino #xfactor
In The Zoney werking that hat. #xfactor
Omg @diamondkwhite better not go home. Thank god @vinoalan is in then bottom.
Check out Me Against the Musicney on #Xfactor tonight!
@househusbraden "Last evening, fellow B stans gathered ‚Äôround the telly in earnest (but mostly tuned in on (cont) 
@househusbraden @britneyspears already took the top spot on @iTunesMusic so apparently she wins. But yes, the XFactor is shit.
@MuuMuse 
Woo! #1 on @iTunesMusic! Congrats @britneyspears and @iamwill #ScreamAndShout 
@breatheheavycom Best parts: 1) @britneyspears awk holdin those floating burning disco balls 2) that walk at the end with her arms flailing
@breatheheavycom Why didn't @iamwill have @britneyspears smash the disco ball? Or have her head on one of the plaques? #MissedOpportunities
#VoteForBritneysTeens
What I've learned from Scream &amp; Shout: @iamwill has a new line of cameras out... #productplacement #subtle
Scream &amp; Shout &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)
Brilliant. #Slayney #ScreamAndShout #TruthTea @britneyspears 
Why didn't @iamwill have @britneyspears smash the disco ball? Or have her head on one of the plaques?! #MissedOpportunities #ScreamAndShout
@britneyspears looks hot in #ScreamAndShout but she just looks uncomfortable to me. You can tell it's not her video and not her direction
@MuuMuse How is she not used to the attention yet. It doesnt make any sense. It doens't even come across as humble anymore. #Awkward
Wait they premiered one verse of the video?! That was it?!  #XFScreamandShoutPremiere
I'm sorry but there are just better country acts out there. @tatestevenscntry #xfactor
This will be the first video @britneyspears will be in that isn't her own. If @iamwill knows what's good for him he won't eff this up
Looks like @fifthharmony is burning in hell in the background after dedicating their song to Jesus last week... #XFactor
Scream &amp; Shout
GET. @vinoalan. OUT. #XFactor
@itskittibitch @Joda308: I'm worried that @vinoalan is going to kill @hannahspears. #XFactor
I'm worried that @vinoalan is going to kill @hannahspears. #XFactor #BritneyArmy
#NewBritneyVideoToday
#ScreamAndShoutToday
#ScreamAndShout @ #2! Almost there...but not sure the #BritneyArmy will be able to bump @eminem, @adamlevine, and @50cent. Stiff competition
#Bionic got the same reviews as #Lotus yet everyone hated Bionic but not Lotus. I don't get it. #Bionic flopped for one reason, @ladygaga
#ScreamAndShoutVideo premiere tonight on @TheXFactorUSA
#britneyARMY get @britneyspears to #1 on @iTunesMusic. It's up to us since we know @iamwill had nothin to do w/ it getting as high as it is
Say what you will but I've officially decided I like #Bionic more than #Lotus
Wowzas #7 @britneyspears! Is #screamANDshout gonna hit #1 on @iTunesMusic?!
#screamANDshout is up to #12 on @iTunesMusic! @britneyspears
@MuuMuse @bradyspears I can't believe this is real. Does she even know this exists? I'm guessing 100% no.
@RyanSeacrest Pretty sure the #britneyARMY was around first... #JustSaying
The average user on @twitter has 126 followers. @britneyspears's dog, @hannahspears, already has 3,713 #TrueLife
#ScreamAndShout is up to #17 on @iTunesMusic! Slowly climbing @britneyspears and @iamwill
Whoa they are giving out some pretty great GCs this year! #12GoldenDays
That awkward moment when @britneyspears's new dog @hannahspears already has more followers than most people on twitter...
@OMFGMusic Ugh the words are different for Only Wanna Dance. I hate that. I like the old ones better...
@headphones_up Greatest Hits: Chapter 1...
@moremichael @OMFGMusic HQ?
@moremichael @OMFGMusic Link doesn't work :-/
The green screen backgrounds are as convincing as @lindsaylohan as Liz Taylor... Oh wait. #LizandDick
Here. We. Go.... #LizAndDick
@MuuMuse Get your drink ready! We'll be wasted in 20 minutes... #LizAndDick
@OMFGMusic Have you heard Smokestacks Sessions Vol 2 yet? I can't find it anywhere...
@OMFGMusic It's slow but nice to hear something a little different from her.
@OMFGMusic All That Matters and Wonderland (surprisingly). WTH is Only Wanna Dance With You on here?! I've had that since last December...
@headphones_up Thank ya thank ya! Happy Thanksgiving!
@moremichael @OMFGMusic Thank ya much. Happy Thanksgiving!
Glad I just paid $18 for a poorly made pizza from @homemadepizzaco. Disappointing bc I've always been impressed 
Pretty sure @GLEEonFOX just sang the wrong lyrics to @kelly_clarkson's #DarkSide... "even if I try to flush you out"...No.
#GetItRight only because @carlyrosemusic is #1...#GotItWrong because @beatricemiller left, @paigeava was safe, and @vinoalan was too high up
FINALLY! @carlyrosemusic #1! The only thing America has gotten right this entire show! @TheXFactorUSA
Seriously who the FUCK watches the @TheXFactorUSA and votes for @vinoalan?! #XFactor
God @khloekardashian is so awkward. "Are you ok?" to @beatricemiller. NO khloe she is CLEARLY not ok! #XFactor
So far not impressed with America's decisions. First @jennelgarcia now @beatricemiller?! The only right decision was @lyric145 #XFactor
Shock two of @britneyspears's acts went home...so conveniently all the mentors have 2 acts left each. How the hell is @paigeava still here?
Ugh @beatricemiller is going to go home because she is going to be balling her eyes out and unable to sing. #XFactor
@arinraysings's apology was too late! See what happens when you insult @britneyspears... #XFactor
Shock. #SeeYouNever @arinraysings Someone messed with @britneyspears and the #BritneyArmy has spoken. #XFactor
#XFScreamAndShoutPremiere
Here we go! #XFactor
Screw the Redskins give me @TheXFactorUSA
@TheXFactorUSA it's not on in DC...football game isn't over yet. Seriously with another sport ruining this?
Is @TheXFactorUSA going to even be on tonight? The fucking #RedskinsVsCowboys game is still on... #ThanksgivingProblems
new song... Scream &amp; Shout ft Britney! 
@HannahAron you clearly just don't understand! #JewGirlProblems
@BMyChillin Neon Trees was the worst!
Sorry @britneyspears can't vote for all the #BritneyTeens tonight...Diamond and Carly all the way. #KByeArin
No seriously Carly Rose already won. She is incredible. #xfactor
Sorry @paigeava but no one does #Everytime like @britneyspears. also pretty sure you didn't cheat on your adoptive mother so bad song choice
Just realized if all of @britneyspears acts are safe this week she will have HALF of the #Top8!! #xfactor #britneyarmy
What seriously who the fuck is voting for @vinoalan? He is so fake, so awful, and so uncomfortable. Get. Him. Out. #xfactor
God I hate @vinoalan. #xfactor Such a kiss ass. He's making me so uncomfortable while singing. #SeeYouNEVER
Omg #hannah is the cutest thing I have ever seen! @britneyspears #xfactor
Collared shirt. Bow. And hair clip. #enough #fifthharmony #xfactor
I hope all this God talk sends them home. #fifthharmony #xfactor also why does that one bitch wear the EXACT same outfit every week.
@ClayReese no I missed it. But LA does the same thing introducing his acts. He's super obvious about it
@itskittibitch wait I literally said the same thing.
Wait why is Arin singing this song to his brother. #xfactor #awkward
You are now now rocking with @iamwill and @britneyspears, bitch. #ScreamAndShout
@breatheheavycom @therealxtina not as uncomfortable as the AMAs...
@MuuMuse @TheXFactorUSA So wait. We go from video premiere Nov 21, to premiere 28, to now just a sneak peak? Why is her team so bad at this?
And just like that...another WW TT. We Want Scream and Shout On Radio. Congrats @britneyspears
Almost all of @PerezHilton's "Worst Dressed" were on @billboard's "Best Dressed" for the #AMAs...
Those. Pants. @justinbieber #AMA2012
@OMFGMusic do you have a link for Feel This Moment?
#ArmyOfMe and #LetThereBeLove were going to be huge in the gay clubs without @TheRealXtina trying that hard... #AMA2012
That was by far the gayest thing I've ever seen in my entire life @TheRealXtina #AMA2012
@OMFGMusic How can anyone let him on stage wearing those pants?
.@nickiminaj and @justinbieber kept @selenagomez in #BeautyAndTheBeat...I'm surprised. #AMA2012.
What. The. Fuck. is @justinbieber wearing?! #AMA2012
As expected @pink slayed with #Try. #AMA2012
@OMFGMusic I'm so surprised.
Wow this is incredibly theatrical for @taylorswift13. She's going all out! #IKnewYouWereTrouble #AMA2012
Wait how is @gwenstefani making that sound with her voice live?! Unreal. #AMA2012 #LookingHot
@OMFGMusic You've seen it 100x before...black bullet proof vest, dancing, and neon green laser lights.
@OMFGMusic Yea I really liked it and was thoroughly entertained. Can't say the same for Usher...
@OMFGMusic Was literally just saying the same thing
Loved the @keshasuxx performance! So fun...and she's actually getting into it. So great! #AmericanMusicAwards
I forgot what a music awards show was like without a performance from @rihanna or @katyperry ...I kind of like it. #AmericanMusicAwards
Could @nickiminaj take any more time getting up on stage? Also, what is wrong with her? She seems so strung out! #AmericanMusicAwards
@kelly_clarkson's shoes tonight were banging! #AmericanMusicAwards
Why is literally every usher performance the same? A black bullet proof vest, smoke, dancing, and laser lights...boring. #AMAs #predictable
@britneyspears needs a full verse! @iamwill had a much bigger part on #BigFatBass than you do on #ScreamAndShout. You're not a backup singer
@TophKlein  ‚Äú@michellebranch: Bacon wedding cake?! What flavor is the cake? Please tell me it's maple icing!! sayooh 
@OMFGMusic #Jump. Prob says something that my fave is just a sample of an old song... #nostalgia
@headphones_up Yikes. I didn't hate Bionic as much as everyone. I guess #TheVoice really is the only thing keeping her relevant these days!
@headphones_up What did Bionic do in the first week?
"I'm the butt police and I'm looking at your reeear reeear reeear" - Eminem #UNALOPOGETIC
@rihanna didnt get the memo that dubstep is on the way out? Guess thats what happens when you get all the leftover songs #unapologetic
I go out for one night and miss the @TheXFactorUSA, @rihanna's album leaks, and a new @keshasuxx song! This is why I stay in
We Want Jennel Back #ComeBackJennel...way to go America!
@britneyspears stop dressing Beatrice in ridiculous outfits and I guarantee she will get more votes. That #YOLO sticker...really? #xfactor
Who the fuck is voting for @vinoalan?! I don't get it #xfactor
#OohLaLaJennel they got it wrong! #xfactor
Fuck! Cannot believe @jennelgarcia is going home when Vino and Arin are still here. #xfactor
Wait @jennelgarcia is 100x better than. @paigeava #xfactor
All the #BritneyTeens safe. #Shocking
#VoteBritneysDivas for #XFactorDivasTonight....except sub Jennel and CeCe for Arin.
I wish @britneyspears would have said something more productive to @CeCeMissxtotheo than "I don't get it." We get it. You don't like her.
@PerezHilton We get it. You're nice now. But lets not lie. #Stripped will never be beaten.
LA leading the way on #MeatlessMonday! 
@amandajleech I think so...but homegirl looks huge.
@amandajleech Yikes 
@itskittibitch Demi is a terrible mentor. She tries way too hard. We get it. You're 20 and feel like you have something to prove. #Stop
Sorry @ddlovato but @simoncowell is right. @Cecemissxtotheo is way better than we've seen her the past two weeks. #XFactor
Didn't @diamondkwhite sing this song last week? Or was that a different Whitney song? #XFactor
.@thexfactorusa someone needs to tell @ddlovato that you don't have to be a pop star to be in this competition... #XFactor not #PopFactor
Ew @ddlovato you are so obnoxious. STFU and let @SimonCowell talk. #XFactor
Not gonna lie, I like @britneyspears's version of #ILoveRockAndRoll better....love @JennelGarcia though
#TrueStarney is back. #Dumb
YAY!!! Diamond is back! #XFactor!
See you NEVER #MittRomney! #BarackObama reelected President of the United States! #4MoreYears! #FORWARD
Favorite songs from #Lotus: #RedHotKindaLove, #LetThereBeLove, #BlankPage and #JustAFool
@moremichael Have you heard you should go vote today? No seriously though, go vote!
#LetThereBeLove is KILLING me . Get me to the gay club ASAP! If you feel like raging at 630am you know it's a good song @TheRealXtina
A yummy soup for the cold weather! Roasted veggie with herb dumplings! Even @HannahAron liked it! 
Too great! So ready for this election to be over already! #Election #Nov6 
@OMFGMusic Why is everyone loving Army of Me? It sounds like a demo to me...
@LivingSocial you cant change regulations for an event, then not offer refunds for those who cant oblige. Terrible business #5kDanceParty
@kelly_clarkson can literally do no wrong. #DontRush sounds amazing live. #CMAs
Is @Jason_Aldean a douche in real life? I have literally nothing to base this on but he just seems like he would be. #CMAs
THANK GOD. @1432 has GOT TO GO. That name is horrendous. Thank you Simon! #XFactor
Knew it. Blech. Simon and Britney disappointed tonight. I want to buy @officialsisterc's album. #XFactor
Ooooh Limited Edition Judges Pepsi Cup?! I can drink just like @britneyspears?! Sign me up now! #Sarcasm...kind of. #XFactor
Can we eliminate 3 of @1432 and keep the rest? And keep @officialsisterc? K thanks. #XFactor
.@ddlovato that was sweet. But let's not lie. @1432  did not do that song anywhere close to as flawlessly as you do every time. #XFactor
Why does the worst girl keep getting to be in the middle of @1432?! She is NOT @NicoleScherzy! #XFactor
Sorry but I like @officialsisterc way better than @1432. #XFactor
Get @1432 out. The name alone makes me hate you. That and the fact that they sang #WANEGBT last night, and somehow made it worse. #XFactor
Wait. Drew, get up off the ground. Keaton, that was embarrassing. Oh @emblemthree how I love to hate you. #XFactor
The last time I was this angry at @britneyspears was when she walked on stage for the 2007 VMA performance. #Speechless #XFactor
Ugh! @britneyspears! You gave into the peer pressure of your fellow judges! @diamondkwhite should not be going home!
Wait @diamondkwhite is a million times better than @arinraysings #XFactor
Congrats @Miranda_Lambert on your big win! #OverYou is such an amazing song and one of my favorites from #FourTheRecord #CMAs
Bye Arin. See you never. #XFactor
@itskittibitch Bye Arin. See you never.
#ImWatchingXFactor and cannot wait for @britneyspears and the #BritneyTeens to take the stage! #XFactor
Wow! So happy! All my least favorites are leaving! #XFactor Loving the judges decisions tonight!
For the first time I can hear the contestant singing! @jasonbroccoli shut the crowd up! #XFactor
Even the judges can't hear the show. Don't get why the crowd on #XFactor is so obnoxious. You don't scream the entire time at a concert...
God @davidcorrey drives me #NUTS. Stop flapping your arm and hand around. Oh yea, and talking about finding your birth mom. #XFactor
I'm so sick of hearing David Corey talk about finding his birth mother. #XFactor
Can we just send all of the #LAOver25s home? Then we won't have to eliminate anyone else. #XFactor
@itskittibitch I missed it. What did he say?
Sad I'm missing the #CMAs but I cannot miss @TheXFactorUSA tonight! My loyalty remains with @britneyspears
YESSSS. @ddlovato made the right decision. Also I love how @khloekardashian just manhandled @cecemissxtotheo to get her out of the shot!
Ugh I just have this bad feeling that @ddlovato is going to save @thatkiddwill. #Mistake
Yikes! @britneyspears doesn't know how to pronounce @keshasuxx and they have worked together. #Awkward
@ddlovato looks like shes about to vomit. #XFactor
Once again can't hear the singing because of the constant obnoxious screaming and screeching of the crowd. Get it together #XFactor
If @cecemissxtotheo goes home tonight I will be #FURIOUS! Get @thatkiddwill out now! #XFactor
Is Jennel wearing the exact same outfit as last night?! #XFactor
Wait. @paigeava and that hat. #GetOut #XFactor
@itskittibitch Get him out. We get it. He's black and sings country so that makes him an original. #Boring.
WTF is going on with Demi's face tonight?!
@HannahAron Want to grab a birthday drink with me, Rach and my parents before celebrations at your house on Saturday?
Listening to @emblem right now. Gotta say I'm #impressed. Like them a lot more now. Now if only Drew would grow up... 
@breatheheavycom kind of boring tbh. She needs to start giving more than one line praises.
Thought @kloekardashian actually did a great job! Excited to see how the rest of the season goes with her and @MarioLopezExtra #XFactor
Whoa @emblemthree lost some weight...
@househusbraden So fucking stupid.
Jesus @carlyrosemusic is so good! I cant get over it. #Xfactor winner. For sure.
I hope @britneyspears gets more comfortable as the show goes on and doesn't continue to limit herself to these one line critiques #XFactor
Interesting that Carly Rose and Emblem3 are last...front runners anyone? #XFactor
@britneyspears time to start giving that "constructive criticism" again...you boring tonight girl! @thatkiddwill is not a true star.
I was surprised when @ddlovato chose @thatkiddwill but this performance is proving that he should not be here. #XFactorUSA
I don't get it... 1432 equals I love you too?
OMG @jasonbroccoli's performance was A-MAZE-BALLS! SO fun! #XFactor
Apparently @ddlovato gets chills...a lot. #Xfactor
Yikes that shirt does NOT look good on @tatestevensctry.. #XFactor
.@ddlovato is ruining some of the best acts in this show. @cecemissxtotheo is WAY better than that song. #Xfactor
I liked @CeCeMissXtotheO way better as a brunette. #XFactor
OMG Simon! "I think the AC is on high tonight..." to @khloekardashian about those nips!
@itskittibitch @LA_Reid Apparently it was "cocked this up"...never heard that in my life. Dont get why that needed to be bleeped out #dumb
@itskittibitch I think he said that @LA_Reid cock blocked Vino
That mic stand made out of chain link... #NotHereForThis
I didn't like Vino before but this song is...terrible. @TheXFactorUSA
@britneyspears was trying to talk. That was #awkward @davidcorrey
@TheXFactorUSA @ddlovato Neither can we. Tell them to shut up! All I hear is screaming!
@TheXFactorUSA has got to get this audio under control. All I can hear is the crowd screaming...
@carrieunderwood That and #BlownAway were my two favorites...oh and #SeeYouAgain!
@chefanneburrell Cocktail Time with Aunt #Sandy...
@adamlambert #FoxandtheHound 
@kelly_clarkson Just started listening online! Can't wait!

@moremichael @OMFGMusic dammit I'm out of town. I may have to hit you up tomorrow if the link is down. #pleaseandthankyou
Bye Jillian and Nick. #XFactor
Get Jennel a stylist ASAP. @TheXFactorUSA
@itskittibitch Sers. I feel like it should be him and Willie honestly but for some reason I think Jillian is going home. Which I'm ok w/
Def just read #LAover25s as #Lovers25 @TheXFactorUSA
Yay @britneyspears got it 100% right! So happy with #Britneyteens! @TheXFactorUSA
@itskittibitch it's a rerun so they can cut it off at any point. They can't do that to a new episode so it's filler. #ugh
This HAS to be better than Marie Callender's...right? Veggie Pot Pies!


Zucchini Burgers with Herb Goat Cheese 

Parm Roasted Broccoli Pasta...so good. So easy! Just ask @stampy423 

Am I the only one who thinks @britneyspears looks uncannily like @iamkatehudson in this picture? No? Just me? #doppelgangers
Damn @Pink! Quite the video! 
Had not one but TWO AppleMapsFails with @househusbraden tonight...got a nice scenic route to Hyattsville for no reason though...
@stampy423 is doing his first 5K ever! LivingSocial's Glow-in-the-Dark 5K Dance Party

Just got chills from @GLEEonFOX's #DontSpeak...
Fruit on pizza = delicious. I think @stampy423  and @McKinseyBond  would agree... 
Damn @kelly_clarkson continues to look amazing these days.  #CatchMyBreath 
27 myths Romney told in 30 minutes. 
@Bethenny Regardless Sonja needs to drop this whole thing. She is def taking advantange. So sick of hearing about this.
@TophKlein I'm almost positive they do...maybe that grease is too subtle
Ready for a little Sunday Funday. #LSbeerfest
@alikroeger @zeller216 Tell TJ I say hi tomorrow!
@househusbraden Oh Apple and your money making ways. #Bullshit. Thank god mine has an Aux Cable...
@zeller216 Finally got a chance to read that. Do you follow GhostsofDC? Haha
@OMFGMusic Ke$ha - Good but predictable. Taylor - Good but predictable. Much more tolerable than WANEGBT
@amandajleech It's a pretty good Britney article.
Really @MrRPMurphy? This episode is really disrespectful considering @britneyspears was on @GLEEonFOX before. #itsbritney #disappointing
@britneyspears gives @GLEEonFOX one of their top ranking episodes ever + they repay her by making fun of her an entire episode? #itsbritney
So @britneyspears gives @GLEEonFOX one of their top ranking episodes ever and they repay her by making fun of her an entire episode? #rude
"I'm gonna say yes....obviously." - @britneyspears. @TheXFactorUSA killing it again.
@HannahAron stop tweeting and driving. See you soon.

@LauraUDDC27 Enjoy. 
@breatheheavycom @katevoegele tweets about @britneyspears

#GoodLuckBritney #XFactorDay @TheXFactorUSA @britneyspears
Only @britneyspears deserves this TBH RT @TheXFactorUSA History is made! The judges just put their hands in the cement! 
I had no intention of watching @NBCTheNewNormal but came across it tonight and I have to say, its hilarious. Been laughing out loud.
Why does this always happen? We go from almost no new music to way too many things all at once?!
See you later #FUNemployment...it's been real!
Spinach Burgers! Who doesn't love spinach and cheese?! 
Check out Jenna's (@yenapadilla) Century Ride:

Wedding website is live! 
@OMFGMusic I would like it if it were anyone else but her. Maybe Carly Rae Jepsen...

@OMFGMusic Wait what. the. fuck.
Best. GIF. Ever. #spicegirls #closingceremonies

Can't help but think of a sobbing @LauraUDDC27 whenever I hear @keshasuxx #HaroldSong. #Mentalimages

#NoNewsIsBadNews Dashboard Confessional
Homemade perogies! #MeatlessMonday

Amazing homemade perogies + @Lightlife  Italian Style Sausages for dinner! Our non-veg friend liked sausages + wants to start buying them!
@breatheheavycom god I hope that's not real. They've been putting way too much black eye make up on her. Not here for #raccooneyes
I know. This is an entire blog post about toast. Trust me. You need to try it. You won't regret it. 

@EstadioDC made your Warm Toast with Honey Butter and Sea Salt at home. #AMAZING 
@benphoster @BorgmeyerRD Great meeting both of you the other day! Sorry our convo had to be so brief...Thanks for the opportunity
Confidence is a must, cockiness is a plus...

Copycat @pizzahut style breadsticks. A-MAZING and Zucchini Sweet Corn pizza. A must make. 
What is the point of torrential downpour if it doesnt even get the weather to stay below 90¬∫ tomorrow!? #storm
@stampy423 Shit are we gonna get stuck in this?! RT @dcist Severe thunderstorms are likely this afternoon... 
Croc with crocs. 
@househusbraden No Sperrys and David?! Start job hunting immediately!
Dear @FoodNetwork why do you only play Diners Drive-Ins and Dives now? Literally all I see is Guy Fieri, everyone's least fav . Get him out.
Phillip Is Awesome. @stampy423, I guess I've got a pretty awesome fiance...I've never had a worldwide trending topic. #jeal
#JustDance @ladygaga just came on my @iTunesMusic &amp; it reminded me when she wasnt "changing the world with her music" and I didn't hate her.
Having the new Tropi-kale Paradise smoothie from @robeks! Surprisingly good...
A filling Friday night dinner before a night of drinking during the #derecho! Spring Pasta w/ #Veggies 
Happy Birthday @KimmyH00! Excited to celebrate tonight! #FridayThe13th
Skip the carry out and try this simple "pad thai" at home! Use seitan instead of chicken and make it #veg or #vegan! 
Great infographic on the effects of going 
#vegan 
@breatheheavycom Whatever happened to the @britneyspears Twister commercial?!
Our grocery store didn't have @Lightlife's Smart Wings so we made these Buffalo Tofu Wings again #MeatlessMonday 
@mtv Your Hills Retro Mania reminded me of the video I made for the Hills Biggest Fan Competition in 2007! 
@LaurenConrad Watch this vid I made for The Hills Biggest Fan Competition @mtv called me but I was &lt; 21 so couldnt come 
Our blog is now listed on @_feastie! 
Amazing review of the #KatyPerryMovie... pretty much confirms everything I thought. 
@stampy423 @chopt Still waiting for that gift card they promised you last time too?
About frickin time RT @dcist D.C. hopes to have smart meters that offer credit card payment options in cabs by the end of the year:
Whoa. When did @twitter change the Trends to be tailored to you. Changed mine back to worldwide.
@OMFGMusic She has been looking banging. Though she's reminding me a bit of Rachael Ray on the cover with that tucked in shirt and jeans...
@TophKlein Shoudve stayed in DC.
Boom. 21,000 views. 
@TophKlein 
Have been making a knockoff version @calpizzakitchen's Original BBQ Chopped Salad for years. This time made it #veg! 
Yup. That about sums it up. "Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes Divorcing Because They Couldn't Fake Being In Love Forever And Plus She's Not a Dude"
Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise split?! I never thought it would lst but am now I'm surprised its happening.
@FoodNetwork I think its time to offer a vegetarian show on the network! 
@Lightlife Just finished editing and uploading now! Gonna email soon but here's the link for a sneak peek! 
@Lightlife Awesome. I'm gonna put together a little webisode to send over with my resume! It'll be great. Get excited.
@Lightlife Do you have to be based out of MA for the job or can you do it from anywhere?
@HeIsWE @stampy423 proposed to me this weekend w/ #AllAboutUs playing in the background. Thanks for the amazing song we'll always remember
@michellebranch And Love Me Like That!
@michellebranch Hotel Paper and Desperately!
Traded in a silly band for an engagement ring last night. #adult
@MRKiNGFATALEXXX What was her setlist? Seeing her on Sunday!
@FoodNetwork our blog is about to reach the 20,000 pageview mark. Can I have a #vegetarian cooking show now? K thanks. 
Even more excited for the @ddlovato concert on Sunday knowing that she now spends most of her time sitting next to @britneyspears
Why can't I find these @krogerco Pizza Dough packets anywhere else?! Made a great pesto pizza with one last night 
This is pretty cool. Test how well you see color! I got a 4/100 (with 0 being perfect) 
Our blog is about to hit 20,000 pageviews! Can't wait to hit that milestone and keep on trucking! 
@EatThisNotThat Apple butter, a slice of cheddar, a slice of green apple, and a slice of green apple. Sounds like a lot but its amazing!
Stuffed pita with homemade hummus, cucumber, tomato, and lettuce. Yum #WhatsForLunch
Another day, another kidney stone. #geriatricproblems
Apparently @stampy423 watches @FoodNetwork without me now...Thanks @GDeLaurentiis for another great recipe!


@tsnydc You should use this pic in your promos! The photographer got a great shot this Sunday. So fun! 
@kelly_clarkson's demo for #TellMeALie is 1000x better than #OneDirections version. This was one of my favorite Kelly leaked demos!
@OMFGMusic Yea well we now live in a world where little kids can buy anything they want with a click of a button using mommy and daddys CC.
@OMFGMusic Was anyone honestly expecting any different?
.@MckinseyBond got to try a Veggie Tales original: Veggie Tales' Lo Mein! 

#vegan #recipe #chinese #HomemadeCarryOut
Tons of veggie recipes for #MeatlessMonday 
Why is @wmata incompetent. Train was supposed to come in 3min, bumped up to 8 and stayed at 8 for 5 mins, then disappeared and now it's 15.
@kelly_clarkson finally cracks the top 200 on @iTunesMusic with #DarkSide!
#SFactor
@McKinseyBond @househusbraden woot. Kinz and I are tweeting from diff rooms of my apt. Soon you can tweet from the third room. #Baller
@househusbraden sounds like a RAGER.

@househusbraden ARE YOU IN DC BITCH @McKinseyBond
@breatheheavycom @itskittibitch Do either of you have the GIF of Britney spilling the martini on herself during the Onyx Hotel Tour?
Who says it's too hot for soup? 
It's kind of amazing how much liking your outfit can change your mood.
This GIF of @britneyspears' response to Demi saying  "I'm the boss" KILLS ME.
