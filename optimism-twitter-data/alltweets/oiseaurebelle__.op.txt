If something gets you down or someone fucks you over, as a constantly happy human being, you're expected to just let it go. No tears/anger.
There's never an appropriate time for you to express your very real sadness. No one takes your unhappy emotions seriously.
Being happy and optimistic and cheerful all the time has its downsides.

People aren't mind readers. They don't know you want to talk to them unless you initiate conversation.
I don't see the sense in waiting for someone to hit me up first. If I want to talk to them, I'll talk to them.
I never understood bitter people. How does it feel to just hate seeing people be happy? How do you live like that?

I look too damn good to just be sitting in the house right now.
American arrogance.
Why try so hard to change people's cultures? Democracy, Western marriages/weddings, Christianity, etc, are not the only right ways of life.
That's what sickens me about the West (esp the US). If it's not something they're used to, it's wrong.
Like that's a long-standing tradition in soooo many cultures... Who are you, Disney, to say that there is anything wrong with that...
Just realized how inhumane Mulan II makes arranged marriages seem...

Let's get married
In all honesty, I'm really  trying to get off of this planet. So soulless.
I've outgrown America. Time for me to go back to Canada or Jamaica or something.
I am just sick and angry and all I can do is cry right now.
This shit just sounds like a story, it doesn't even seem possible.
And don't have the decency to respect our bodies after they kill us. I can't...
Cops are separating human beings from their friends, family, from this fucking REALM, with no regrets or worries. I don't understand.
"Protect and serve" my ass. Why is killing black kids so okay?
The sad thing is, some ppl will try so hard to justify cops killing us. Pigs out here taking lives of innocent ppl and you wanna justify it?
I'm beautiful, not necessarily because I look better than others, but because I acknowledge/love my physical flaws.
Looks obviously play the biggest part in being beautiful, but another aspect of it is owning what you've got.
Um hi

That's just the basics of loyalty to me, though. Eternal support/companionship/honesty for your alleged friends. But y'all not hearing me.
And I'm just gonna throw this out there... If you mess with my girl, that's equivalent to you messing with me.
It's so hard to find people that are going to be there for you WHENEVER and WHEREVER.
And then you have those who are only friends with you for the image that it portrays.
And then you have those that ONLY want to be around when times are hard. Can't stand to see you happy/prosperous. It almost sickens them.
@K_drick27360 that doesn't excuse talking about them behind their back, but that's just me.
You have those that don't ever want to be around you when times are hard, too much pressure for them.
I feel like nowadays, most friendships are a "here today, gone tomorrow" type of situation.
@K_drick27360 that's awesome, but if they're your friends and you want them in your life, don't talk shit. Address the situation with them.
@K_drick27360 lol I'm talking about "friendships"
Go so hard for ya girl one minute, but let her do something you don't agree with and you'll talk shit about her till you're blue in the face
Some of you guys' ideas of loyalty are so funny/foreign to me.

@Saraaax15 problem is, "acting equally" gets us killed too. We aren't "pulling a race card." RACE IS THE ISSUE. Not something u could fathom

Them "giving" us the "right to an equal education".."allowing" us to be rich..I hope you see that it's all bullshit. Something to silence us
You may have prohibited me from exercising my rights for a LONG TIME, White America, but you are no hero of mine for opening YOUR eyes.

And I'm not sometimey. If I like you today, I'll like you tomorrow, like you next week, and most likely next year.
If I GENUINELY like someone, I'm not going to be subtle about it. I'm not gonna throw myself at him, but subtlety.... Nah.
Why am I just now learning about Mangal Pandey? I guarantee most of you haven't heard of him either. Look him up. Watch his movie.

‚Äú@charmof_gabss: @oiseaurebelle__ @BenchJackson hmm. So nothing of any importance. Okay.‚Äù Basically.
@charmof_gabss @BenchJackson she's claiming we feel "entitled" and that Mike Brown "lived a thug life".. Smh the ignorance
@BenchJackson @charmof_gabss Bitch you sound ignorant &amp; racist as fuck and I'm not about to argue w you.

And I really hate giving up on people, but I guess sometimes it's necessary. So if I cut ppl off, believe me when I say it wasn't my plan.
And I can't really call people my friends if I don't trust them. The love will always be there, but as far as friendship goes... Nah.
It takes me no time at all to forgive people. Everyone deserves forgiveness. My trust in you might disappear, though.
Not everyone who say they're for you means it.

@the_LondonLook disgusting!! Smh
We have so many solvable problems here, but we want to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars we don't have to kill ppl across the ocean. #OH
That's just sickening. How people deem others worthy of death? And why is America so quick to support such an inhumane cause?
Educate yourself on this conflict before you speak on it, because hundreds of thousands of lives are on the line.
That's the Christian thing to do/say.
The way to solve our problems is by killing people. Innocent people. Because they're Islamic. Because they're different. That makes sense.
