Me, in response to positive reviews on my stories:
YES, YES, SCREAM FOR ME, MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PUPPETS
I currently have a Google image tab for "sock suspenders" open because of @AJ_RimmerRD. Hmm, hmm, yes, very good.
@RamsesNibblick @AJ_RimmerRD @mrlistersir1 You were wearing those sexy sock suspenders....
Posted up chapter 4 of my Kuroko fic early because of clamoring fans. It's so weird having fans. I don't know what to do but feed them.
@whytocrying Weren't all of the Time Turners destroyed in book five? &gt;__&gt;
There are cherry blossoms all over the employee entrance hall.
Coworker: "Someone animed in the hall again."
Me: "Oh goddammit."
We have all the doors propped open at work bc it's super hot in here but that just means I'm still too warm AND my allergies are killing me.
@spaceliontobi Oh heck yes! &lt;3
@BillyDenton23 I know just
Excellent Adventure &gt; Seventh Seal &gt; Bogus Journey
@BillyDenton23 Less Swedes. Also, I prefered Excellent Adventure.
Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy did a Seventh Seal episode. Also a God Emperor of Dune episode. That show was great.
Really, really want to watch The Seventh Seal. It's been a while and I love that movie. Ingmar Bergman is amazing.
Accurate.  
@BillyDenton23 Jane wa dork desu
I just made an ESPN account to watch basketball and named myself jane_no_basuke. I think I might actually have a problem.
@puppiesandanime Politely disagree.

@ChZuckBean Thanks. *hugs*
@infinite_ammo *hugs* Thank you.
@unintelligibl3 Thank you for soft hugs, little robot friend. &lt;3
I'm going to go play Warcraft and pretend that my brain isn't fucked up.
@UnseenPerfidy I know you do. *hugs*
@UnseenPerfidy I'm just...taking it really hard. Like, I just want help and I hate needing it.
@UnseenPerfidy I have another appointment next week and I wouldn't have been able to start the meds until next weekend anyway.
@UnseenPerfidy She didn't know, she's my new doc. And I didn't know what the med was, or I would have said something.
This situation has sent me into a dramatic self-hatred spiral and I can't stop crying. Whee.
I talked to my GP about meds for my bipolar. She gave me a script for a med I hadn't heard of. It's an SSRI, which I can't take.
My face needs to stop being numb soon so I can eat food.
My dentist thought I was a natural redhead because I metabolize anesthetic so quickly.
Half of my face is numb.
Back at the dentist for the rest of my fillings. Trying not to have an anxiety attack. Might as well save it for the wisdom tooth removal.
@BillyDenton23 You are a good friend.
@BigBardaFree I assume you saw that they're filming series 11? I'm really excited, though series 1 and 5 will always be my favs.
@BigBardaFree I would love to be the one that does this. Because RD is my absolute jam and Farscape is pretty okay!
I place my hand upon my heart, feel that it is still beating, and remind myself: Past performance is not a predictor of future results.
The cardinal emotions are wild abandon, guarded affection, directionless jealousy, and irritation.
When you die, the surface of the moon will not change.
Beware.
Be warned.
Be wary.
@bropiates @MaraWritesStuff Bees can be awake whenever they want. Who is going to tell them otherwise?
Man, it's been days since anyone got fast and/or furious.
@BillyDenton23 You already follow me! We already talk about JoJo!!
People who like #jojo_anime or #KurokoNoBasket should probably follow me so I have more people to talk to about these things, okay?
Guhh I should just never talk. I'm regretting every time I talk. I'm going to burrow into a hole.
@TheMadWelshman OH MAN
I miss Red Dwarf being on Netflix so I could just fall asleep to Series 1 episodes, with Rimmer's voice lulling me to peaceful brainspace.
@TheMadWelshman I have no idea what that is o___o
@TheMadWelshman And watch Red Dwarf. Forever.
@TheMadWelshman That would be nice but I had previous plans and didn't want to be a dick. Tea would be lovely. I want to have tea.
I'm super irritable and, as a result, am curled up in the farthest chair so I don't grump too hard at my friends. *reads fanfic angrily*
Drinking a Newcastle Werewolf by @caledonianbeer - 
Goodness gracious no wonder I was so antisocial as a child. Children are so overbearing and invade space without thought. D:
@FakeTSR Yes and yes, we did too.
@SeenPerfidy I hope this doesn't sound condescending, but I'm really proud of you.
@SeenPerfidy That is an awful feeling, but you're making progress now, which is really great.
Uploaded the third chapter of Harmonic Convergence, my KagaMido fic. Now I sit desperate for the praise of strangers. 
@SeenPerfidy That's terrible. The people who care for you will want to be there for you. I'm glad you're dealing with your problems now.
I'm so bad at writing engaging plots. Everyone is either a serial killer or I like them too much to make bad things happen to them.
@BigBardaFree I feel this. :(

Since watching Kuroko no Basuke, I've started framing my description of everything as [Character] no [Defining Trait].
Beauty, thy name is Dwayne "The Spock" Johnson. @TheRock 
@BillyDenton23 I do gymratting and fencing and basketballs but my mom would never believe any of that xD

So the emotionally braindead tsundere is going to get spooked and yell BAKA a lot so they have a misunderstanding and have to make up.

now I guess they're just boyfriends and the tension is gone

@sfrdnbrg Luckily they're labeling more things for H₂O content so people like you can avoid accidental H₂O exposure.
@ben_304 That just means you have more foot to show off and enjoy the freedom that a lack of shoes offers!
@ben_304 Oh man, do you have like bony hairy dude feet? Because those are totally cute too! GET YOUR FEET OUT WHENEVER AND WHEREVER.
@ben_304 Shoes are oppressive and awful and they make my extremely cute feet really unhappy. That's basically unforgivable.
Re: shoe-shaming.
Coworker: Bit of a hillbilly, huh?
Me: Yes. My family roams the wilds of the US South like a pack of feral wolves.
@sfrdnbrg Personally I'm super into drinking water and pretending it's got medicine in it. It helped cure my crippling ennui.
"Well my whole family..."
"LALALA ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I CAN'T HEAR YOU LALALLA"
Same coworker that was shoe-shaming me is now trying to sell me on chiropractors despite my saying, "No. There is no supporting science."
I'd just like to say, @Miss_GraceJones is my actual hero. She's strong and confident and beautiful and amazing.
Coworker: *pokes me* Hey, you're not wearing shoes.
Me: My feet are too warm. You're lucky I ever wear shoes. I hate shoes.
I just learned that Grace Jones poked Roger Moore with dildos during their Bond sex scenes and she's even more amazing with this info.
@MadniZilla Oh, I love your over-shirt! It's awesome!
@SharkPrinceRen I saw a picture of a bird tongue earlier and I thought, man, birds have the best tongues. I wish I had a bird tongue.
As a species, birds have superior tongues.
@BillyDenton23 I hate showering in the morning almost as much as I hate....I don't even have a thing. I hate showering in the morning.
@BillyDenton23 I started writing but I'm not making a ton of progress. I'll finish this scene then sleep. I want my hair to dry before bed.
@princessology I could see that. A lot of the episodes have a slow build and the ones on The Wall are just boring tbh.
Mk so I got to the part in my KagaMido fic where they finally kiss and idk where to go from here? Idk if I should sleep on it or just write.
@WhySharksMatter You are amazing, just FYI.
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the

Love is all you need to destroy your enemies.
@sfrdnbrg No, I'm not on or in them currently, though one day I want a houseboat so I can conquer my fears and also be Hemingway.
@sfrdnbrg I mean lakes are cool I guess but I'm super afraid of deep water so it's maybe not the best position for me personally?
@sfrdnbrg I'm in the Michigan peninsular hemisphere. It's not very impressive but we have lakes?
@sfrdnbrg Northern! Or Eastern, depending on how you cut it.
@sfrdnbrg In triplicate.
@sfrdnbrg Perfect, thank you. I do appreciate it being official.
@sfrdnbrg Of course, we're best friends now, remember?

@sfrdnbrg OF COURSE YOU CAN TAP SHOES ARE SUPER COOL
@sfrdnbrg DO YOU WANNA GO DO KARATE IN THE GARAGE OR...??
@sfrdnbrg DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS
Sometimes when I'm on Twitter I just want to reply to everyone with super childish stuff like "butts in the ass" or "weiners."
Catching up on @NightValeRadio in preparation for the show this weekend! Wearing the purple headphones for my Cecil cosplay. :D
@gordonj2k Mine is one part Hpnotiq to two parts Jones but I love the taste of Hpnotiq xD
@gordonj2k @SharkPrinceRen @BillyDenton23 Holy shit it's so good.
Drinking Hpnotiq mixed with Jones Berry Lemonade soda in the company of @SharkPrinceRen and @BillyDenton23 because we're trashy as fuck.
I just actually screamed out loud. 
@MadniZilla You have such pretty eyes I just can't. (If I get creepy please just tell me okay)
marvel fan: i know right! they suck! 
dc fan: HOW DARE YOU SPEAK ABOUT MY BELOVED DC COMICS LIKE…
@BigBardaFree This is absolutely accurate.
@SavedYouAClick More like Hotburglar amiright?
@lhmcmillan @bibliobotic Also more likely to report abuse and have sex responsibly when they become active. Sex ed is a great thing.
@ben_304 @_archives_ Yes is the best idea when hedgies and cute Pokemon are concerned.
Literally everything in this shop looks like the wardrobe from a post-apocalyptic movie. I am so in. 
@deanwolf @Gabrielle_Faust Oh no, all of their stuff is awesome o___o
#파워오브카와이이 
There are my loyal Kuroko no Yaoi fans, commenting on my newest chapter and making me all stupid with giddiness and pride. (*≧∀≦*)
@BillyDenton23 It was weird but way nicer than the garbage I usually have to listen to at the library so it was a net positive experience?
@unintelligibl3 *pet pet pet*
There are art teachers in my library, taking down the stuff from the K-12 art show. They're so...positive and happy and optimistic.
@d_m_elms @mollycrabapple "War paint" is a pretty common term that's used to refer to makeup?
@ben_304 Yes, she is! This woman is a queen and she's stolen my heart!
&gt;Why isn't anyone reading my new chapter?
&gt;Oh right, the kind of ppl who read Kuroko fanfic probably aren't awake at 9am.
Reapplying your war paint in the middle of a battle. 
@aROSEthatGREW Those are some gorgeous kicks. o___o
It's Kagami X Midorima (that's not Kuroko) but yes, this.

@BillyDenton23 We should go together.
I kind of want a tattoo of the Joestar family birth mark tbh.
Umm if any of you folks wanna read some #Kuroko #yaoi trash, find me on #AO3 @ therobotjane! &gt;___&gt;
@latentelegy You're welcome! :D
@latentelegy Beta'd and returned! I liked it a lot! :D
@dosnostalgic Better than goose feet.
@dosnostalgic While you are entitled to your opinion, I politely disagree. Also, FEET.
@dosnostalgic Dammit! My Spongebob game has failed you. I've failed you. And I'm sorry.
@dosnostalgic Is that the episode where everyone leaves and Spongebob snaps and starts building everything out of patty meat?
@latentelegy Received! I just got in the bath, so I'll read your filth once I'm squeaky clean!
Problems That I Have And The Friends That Share Them  
@latentelegy Right?! It's the worst problem!
@latentelegy Let me know when you send it and I'll read it asap!
@latentelegy You can email it! janie.t.robot@gmail.com!
@latentelegy Sure!
@latentelegy Hey, I've written serial killers with sweet, flowery language soooo
@latentelegy Don't be afraid to be nasty. Or flowery. Just go with how you like to write.
@latentelegy It'll be okay. I promise. Just cringe really hard and hit send.
@latentelegy Mmm yes, I can understand that. You're letting people into the naughty parts of your brain. The thing though? THEY LOVE IT
@latentelegy @BigBardaFree What do you need help with?
@MadniZilla Okay, one of my fav fic tropes is Completely Clueless Character xD
@MadniZilla The Gotham livetweeting is how I missed it. I see that now. Carry on.
@MadniZilla HOW DID I MISS THIS PICTURE?! YOUR HAIR IS SO CUTE AND SO IS YOUR FACE I'M GONNA DIE
@SharkPrinceRen Oh, I'm all excited to write again now! I was just staring at my screen like D: D: D:
I love that when I'm having a fanfic problem, @SharkPrinceRen gives me both encouragement and great ideas.
@unintelligibl3 Manga lesbians. Slightly different art style, not as soft.
@TheAVClub Is the fragrance called "Erotic Asphyxiation"?
@unintelligibl3 liberal here, now i'm not a racist but....
@TheNthDoctor Who wants to buy my account? You'll have to scrub it of basically everything but hey like 200+ followers! I'd buy that for $1.
@BigBardaFree Corn Dogs are the Spotted Dick of England.
@progeer Right?? Have an opinion for five seconds and my phone won't stop buzzing. D: D: D:
@UnseenPerfidy I want hot chocolate. I'm all jealous now.
Um, yes. 
I'm dying over the idea of ppl looking at my tf bc I made a statement &amp; all they find is anime and Spongebob and angry fanfic tweets. /wave
Oh god, a bunch of people retweeted my last posts and now people are talking to and following me. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. *hides*
Basically, you don't agree with Joss Whedon, fine whatever. "He deserved death threats!" No. Nope. Sorry.
That shit is how Nerd Culture got started. Like WE'RE NERDS SO WE CAN BE SHITTY TO WHOEVER AND IT'S FINE. No. Nope. Sorry.
Yo
Being shitty to people is not okay
Even if they are privileged
That doesn't give you the right to become a harasser
That is all
@AJ_RimmerRD I thought you might have noticed.
@CYBERSTALIN WILL WE EVER SNEER THE SAME WAY AGAIN
@CYBERSTALIN Oh god, me too! Why did you draw my attention to this?!
"Great pacing"
"Perfect characterization" 
"Give me more!"
*basks in the glow of the praise of strangers*
Oh my goodness, I woke up to tons of good reviews on the cutesy fic I'm writing and it's just made my whole day!
@Five_Three I do the same thing with my dice! How cute! :D
@Five_Three Damn boy, are those natural?
@latentelegy Agreed.
@kuvosa What's a tortoise?
@SharkPrinceRen Yessss &lt;333
@SharkPrinceRen There's the AoKagaMido fic I have to send you when I'm at my computer. It's called "Overdose" on AO3 if you don't wanna wait
@SharkPrinceRen Kagami is such a big dummy and Midorima is just a different kind of dummy and I love them so much.

This is it people. This is what we've been training for.
@SharkPrinceRen GOOD.
"Guhhh Methos wants my crystal necklace to save the woman he loves but I don't wanna wahhh"
Fuck you, Amanda.
#HighlanderMonday
@SharkPrinceRen Kagami calling Midorima "pretty lashes" has killed me. I'm dead. 
Murasakibara: Primarily purple
Akashi: Red control
FUCKING JAPAN
Kagami: Fire God, I'm big
Kise: Yellow, too cool
Kuroko: Shadow son
Midorima: Really very green
Aomine: Blue peak, very bright
Now I'm translating their characters and getting more and more angry. Their names are all puns.
Motherfucker the characters for Kagami's last name are literally "I'm big." Goddammit Japan. #Kuroko
@kelseyr713 @BryanFuller AHHHH THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME SO I CAN GET EXTRA HYPE
@SharkPrinceRen I'm working on it! Give me a minute xD
@SharkPrinceRen Right??!
@ChZuckBean Right? She's a queen, she didn't need Ross/Rachel drama.
@ChZuckBean Is she the "on a break" girl? I loved her! I actually kind of hated Rachel in those episodes.
@SharkPrinceRen MY SHIIIIP 
APPARENTLY a lot of people like Aomine/Midorima? That's my most popular fic and idk. I didn't think it was that good.
@BillyDenton23 Mystery solved then! Awesome, thank you!
@BillyDenton23 He left Twitter I guess? Idk
@latentelegy Oh hun. Take care of yourself. *hug*
Apparently I went to the gym and missed something bc everyone is mad at Joss Whedon?.
I'm in love with my own biceps. Is that wrong?
OH MY GOD PLEASE YES 
Working on a cutesy fanfic and it's making me happy. Maybe some gym time/WoW this morning, since I'm off work? Idk, whatever.
@ChZuckBean OH MY GOD YES, ME TOO
Sheamus might be my favorite wrestler now that he's turned heel. #WWE

@nickb0l I'm sorry :(
@SeenPerfidy That's just your depression talking. I promise.
A stranger left a positive comment on one of my fics and I'm just so giddy right now.
@nickb0l Yup, it was one of the comics for Free Comic Day! I got a Street Fighter and a Transformers one as well.
*realizes finding fairies is more feasible*
*h…
The Street Fighter comic from FCBD is really cute! I'm so glad I picked it up.

@latentelegy Not true! I married you because you're so patient when I'm doing my calibrations!
@latentelegy My waifu is too pretty. I can't handle it! &lt;333
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen TOO ADORABLE!!
@SharkPrinceRen Just remember: I'm your senpai!

@CYBERSTALIN Well, I have a new ship. Thank you. &lt;333
#FCBD success! #JoJo 
@SharkPrinceRen I know bby. U r the best. &lt;333
I almost feel bad making @SharkPrinceRen listen to my Kuroko fanfic rants bc he's only seen like 5 eps, but I don't. 
I just posted the MidoKaga fic I hammered out today. Midorima needs more ships than just Takao. NSFW, gay sex. 
@MadniZilla Ugh, too adorable. My heart, it cannot take this level of cuteness.
@dogpictbotneo Hey @PrinceOfBrains look at this cute dog and his babies.
Oh no, I'm in the midokaga tag on Tumblr. Send help. #Kuroko #TheseTwoAreBecomingMyFavoriteShip
Okay, I know how I'll be getting through workdays from now on. Just with JoJo vampires instead. 
@TheMadWelshman I have pretty sweet lower body strength, but my upper body is weak. So that's what I work the hardest! ^__^
Worked out hard this morning and it felt great. I need to go to the gym more frequently. It makes my heart happy.
Haven't been to the gym in a while? FUCK IT RUN A MILE LET'S GO #FeelsGreat #DunkingOnDweebs 
@BillyDenton23 @SharkPrinceRen 
@SharkPrinceRen I AM HERE WAITING TO DUNK ON YOU
@SharkPrinceRen IF I SLOW MY ROLL I WILL COME TO A FULL STOP AND FALL ASLEEP
@SharkPrinceRen YES PANTS ARE A GOOD START I'VE BEEN IN MY WORKOUT CLOTHES SINCE 7AM BOUT TO GO DUNK ON SOME DWEEBS
@UnseenPerfidy They are actual offspring of Satan and Hitler.
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY THE NICE WEATHER, ALLERGENS! GODDAMN!
I have my face by my open window bc it's super nice out but now my eyes itch and my nose is snuffy. Allergies are the worst.
@SharkPrinceRen GET OUT OF BED WE HAVE TO GET SWOLE
@RonnieFilyaw There are a lot of thoughts about Ronnie's butt in this comic and they make me uncomfortable. #RonniesButt
@kateleth Not a tumblr, but @Ladybeard_Japan is so amazing.
@ben_304 Thanks! :D &lt;3
Re: @aROSEthatGREW's feed rn, rap is a form of expression. It's no more to blame for violence than poetry/paintings. Expression is valuable.
Days off are the best days. Laying around, waiting to hit the gym with @SharkPrinceRen. The weather is lovely today. 
#WeebClub did a live reading of My Immortal tonight. I love these people. @ChZuckBean @PrinceOfBrains @SharkPrinceRen @BillyDenton23
@damianfoxart Acceptable!
"List two people that have inspired you"
Pinhead. Definitely Pinhead. And, I dunno, Angela from Sleepaway Camp? Yes, them.
@ChZuckBean @BillyDenton23 I love you guys.
@BillyDenton23 AND I have a VNV Nation song stuck in my head! The hell!
I now get to go from home (with a screeching neighbor kid in the lobby) to the gymnastics place (full of screeching kids). Siiiiiigh.
I just changed my bio location to a Kuroko and The Smiths joke. I'm really proud of myself rn tbh.
@latentelegy NO GARRUS, IT CAN'T. I HAVE NEEDS. SEXY CAT-BUG-LIZARD THING NEEDS. GIMME THAT DEXTRO DNA.
@latentelegy (Seriously though, I read that line so many times, I expected Garrus to ask me to play Pazaak next.)
@MadniZilla @SharkPrinceRen CONSIDER YOUR BINARY WRECKED 
@latentelegy @BigBardaFree Of course, baby.
@latentelegy @BigBardaFree I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. I'm in the middle of some calibrations.
@MadniZilla @SharkPrinceRen ARE WE DUNKING ON THE GENDER BINARY OVER HERE AND CAN I JOIN IN???
@SharkPrinceRen "What does a guy look like, exactly? Can you give me a checklist or...?"
@SharkPrinceRen OH GEE YOU MUST KNOW MY GENDER BETTER THAN I DO THANKS FOR CORRECTING ME FUCKWAD
Shit, I replied to a @BaileyJayTweets post and now ppl are retweeting me. Go away, ppl. It's all anime and smut up in here. Nothing to see.
I'm going to take it upon myself to write Midorima X Everyone Except Takao because Takao isn't even that interesting you guys.
@BaileyJayTweets Being empowered by the male gaze is different from being consumed by it. I think you're a great feminist. &lt;3
"It's been a while since Tetsuya noticed that his best friend is smoking hot and that that makes him kind of gay" yes okay
@TheMadWelshman Accurate.
Boss, giving a tour: "Over here is the assistance desk.."
Me, glares, continues reading fanfic.
Boss: "..where you can ask.."
Glares harder.
yelling about animne and fanfiction on twitter dot com
Kagami/Kuroko, Aomine/Kise, Midorima/Takao
Really? That's all we've got? Thank you, English-speakers.
@therobotjane And this one is in Indonesian? What the hell? Is it only non-English speakers that have good Kuroko ships??
Of COURSE the only Kuroko fic that's sounded interesting so far is IN CHINESE.
I'M NOT JUDGING JUST CONFUSED
HOW CAN SOMEONE WRITE 42K WORDS ABOUT AN AU IN WHICH THE GUYS FROM KUROKO ARE FIREFIGHTING ANGELS?????
Sometimes I read fanfic descriptions and just laugh uncontrollably. Then see they're 42k words long and think wtf I can't write that much.
@TheMadWelshman Boots are acceptable for dressing up.
Shoes are a sucker's game. #FuckShoes
@TheAngryFangirl Maybe that's why they need to hire a writer?
@GameOfThrones @iwanrheon Can you explain why Ramsay is so attractive? He shouldn't be. I demand answers. #AskGoT
@elucidarian Sleepgrumps are totally adorable and endearing! First in the morning grumbles are one of the cutest things. &lt;3

Nah they're imaginary

@UnseenPerfidy @borderlinefemme Oh yes. Especially if they're cute glasses. It's such a terrible question.
Someone called off this morning so we're hella understaffed. clapping emoji 100% emoji

@ChZuckBean @tnphilpott I'm not racist, but I approve of this idea.
@yuriprincess_ @unintelligibl3 Thank you ^__^
@yuriprincess_ @unintelligibl3 What anime is this?
@BillyDenton23 Kars' response was even better. “Oh, human, I couldn't even begin to explain. I daresay you wouldn't comprehend it.”
@unintelligibl3 Reasons why I fav so many brash posts but my feed is all anime and smut and fangirling.
@ChZuckBean Christ, you played a fighting game with @BillyDenton23? You asked for it.
@ChZuckBean Exactly. Also, if you weren't hanging out with @BillyDenton23 BEHIND MY BACK you'd be keeping up. ;p
@ChZuckBean Sorry &gt;__&lt; I got to EPL and the quests there are SO GOOD.
School stuff: taken care of. 
Fanfics: read. 
RP forum: posted on. 
WoW: about to be played. 
Being a grownup: overrated.
I failed at ceasing to giggle.
"'H...how were you even hiding that in there?' Joseph glanced quickly over to the discarded loincloth, then back into the pillarman's eyes."
Supposed to be receiving a call in a minute from my student rep about classes that start soon. Need to stop giggling about JoJo fanfic.
@BillyDenton23 Oooh.
@BillyDenton23 That we watch what? I'm not seeing the tweet this is reply to.
Next fic. 
@latentelegy You're so welcome. It was an exercise in writing through my brain's NO THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN reflex hahaha
@latentelegy Hahaha GOOD. I'm so glad you enjoyed it. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@latentelegy WHAT. DUNCAN WANTS TO PUT HIS MANLY SWORD INTO THE DARK CLEFT OF EVIL DUNCAN'S MUSCULAR ASS.
@latentelegy PERFECT. Because that was the entire point of that line.
Here's the Highlander smut I was writing for @latentelegy if anyone is interested xD

@FauxBenBen @latentelegy Hahaha xD I ended up calling it "Deliver Us To Evil" because the episode title was Deliverance.
@latentelegy There, Highlander fic up on AO3, dedicated to you. Enjoy. xD
@latentelegy Hey, what should I call this Duncan/Evil Duncan fic? It's finally done and I suck at titles. :P
"Sorry it took so long to pay my late fees! We had a drive-by then our house burned to the ground..."

@Five_Three She's someone that the mental health system has failed, so she's afraid of labels and medication and uggggh
Lady at work ranting about it being bad to label mental illnesses, as if categorization doesn't help with treatment.
@SharkPrinceRen @CecilBaldwinIII I just don't want to give the impression that there are molesters waiting for him in Detroit. xD
@SharkPrinceRen @CecilBaldwinIII I wouldn't actually touch Cecil's butt without permission, but it was too funny not to make the joke.
Talking to @SharkPrinceRen about @NightValeRadio live:
"VIDEO MAY HAVE KILLED THE RADIO STAR BUT I'LL STILL TOUCH HIS BUTT" @CecilBaldwinIII
This would make me swoon, tbh. 
Pretty sure "Columbus was a fuckboy" is the best thing I've read all morning. @aROSEthatGREW
@dosnostalgic Aethra Chronicles was my #1 shareware pleasure. It ate so many hours. Eventually I got the full version but not for years.
@PrinceOfBrains @dosnostalgic Some of the levels have trees. Others do not. It's really only noticeable in the full version.
@ChZuckBean Yes, that is true.
I also feel this tweet on a spiritual level. 
I feel this tweet on a spiritual level. 
@BillyDenton23 No, so I'm afraid I'll never be good at writing Pillar Men fanfic D:
I blame Andy's Norwegian accent. And I can't stop giggling.
"Sent down from heaven above / to become a rose among the ashes" sounds like "Sent down from heaven above / to cum all over my biatches" &gt;_&lt;
Listening to Icon of Coil's "Love As Blood." Realize that the lyrics can be easily misheard when a coworker shoots me a dirty look.
@PaulyShore You're amazing. &lt;3
@TheMadWelshman I always keep a notebook at my bedside because I have my best ideas as I'm falling asleep but it got moved and now I'm sad.
@TheMadWelshman The best part is, I rolled over to grab my notebook and it WASN'T THERE so I thought "Oh, I won't forget" and dozed off. D:
When I was falling asleep last night, I had a great idea featuring the JoJo's vampires and I didn't write it down and now it's gone. :(
I honestly think that Eastern Plaguelands is my favorite zone now. The Fiona's Caravan quests are so good. #worldofwarcraft #SomeWoWTweets
@latentelegy Then maybe no. Maybe bellydance lessons at home?
@latentelegy Definitely yes.
@kelseyr713 Okay, screaming foxes are so scary o__o
If @AndrewWK can bring his kind spirit to an extremist station then may he forever preach the word of Party.
@nickb0l Blood Elves are superior to basically every other race in the game.

I'm not political. I'm just party. 

I even party with people who are very different…
Hmmm I think Tarenar Sunstrike and I make a pretty cute couple. 
@spaceliontobi That's reassuring at least xD
@spaceliontobi Is that because I'm badly out of practice so you know you'll win? ;p
@spaceliontobi My neighbor is so sweet. Her name is Jennae and we'll have to invite her when we go play basketball! :D
Today I walked outside wearing a Star Trek snapback and my neighbor immediately asked me if I wanted to play basketball. Fuck yes I do.
I'm a pale dork that spends too much time thinking about anime and horror movies but I'm accepted unquestioningly by all of my neighbors.
I just want to say that diverse communities are beautiful. I'm so thankful for my neighbors.
@BillyDenton23 Don't be. Puns are the highest form of humor.
@SharkPrinceRen It's alright, soft friend. You're always invited.
@SharkPrinceRen yarlyyyyyy
There are Iwatobi ones though. Oh no.
Fuuuuuck my wallet is over 
Also, no one has Kuroko sweatbands? Really?
@latentelegy As soon as Lydia's out for the summer I'm switching to a three day week to give myself time for writing/art. You are inspiring.
I need wrist sweatbands so when I play basketball I look cool. These are things that concern me.
@Five_Three Seriously. But fortunately, there are eloquent people like @IjeomaOluo who stand up to them. &lt;3
Thx to @IjeomaOluo I know that trans folks need to be invited in like vampires. Come in, my soft friends. You are all wonderful.

#PartyHeart
@Veeren_Jubbal Veerender is a soft friend, not a tough guy.
Brent Spiner, smacking down bigots in his intensely polite way. &lt;3 
So damn @BigBardaFree is online to read all of my JoJos tweets!
The same coworker that makes fun of fat people all the time just yelled at me for calorie counting. I just don't even know.
I don't understand why so many slash writers want to make the Pillar Men all gentle and sweet? I'm not judging, I just don't get it.
Joseph/Kars with JoJo unable to move because he's holding Lisa Lisa? I'm in. &gt;_____&gt;
Woman who spent fifteen minutes yelling at me about the copy machines now wants my help to find an envelope she dropped. Nope, sorry.
@MadniZilla Looking at JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fanfics &gt;____&gt;
"au in which the Pillar Men are a normal family"
WHAT NO I WANT KARS MURDERFUCKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE
....that's probably bad
@BillyDenton23 No, but his arm blades and baby vampire fangs are there so the squirrel isn't necessary. All three is overkill.
This is going to be my entire day, I can already tell. #JoJo #Kars 
OH NO HE'S HOT @PrinceOfBrains @BillyDenton23 @BigBardaFree

@BillyDenton23 Not the video I was expecting and I don't know what I was expecting, just not this. But it's perfect.
@BillyDenton23 Wait, I wasn't before? My whole life has been a lie!
Tfw I have to clarify that the story I wrote doesn't contain erotic horror 
I love my colorful new headphones. They make me happy and contrast with my hair. 
Literally me. 
I'm honestly surprised this list isn't longer.

@BillyDenton23 Well, yes, there is that. 
I have noticed in my old age that overly critical people aren't edgy, they're trying to compensate for their own lack of self-worth.
I can't imagine being so wrapped up in a sports team's success that their loss ruins my day. I'm not judging, I just don't get it.
I just...I'm developing a JoJo problem.
@sexcellentciel That doesn't make you a bad person. Just saying.
Okay, I just got to Stardust Crusaders and it's pretty delightful so far. #JoJo
Oh no, old Joseph Joestar is a silver fox!
Stardust Crusaders first order of business: let Dio out, good plan everyone.
Kars is glorious and I hate it because he's such a bastard.
@Five_Three Aww thanks!
Kars: YO I JUST BECAME A PERFECT BEING. FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS? HAND SQUIRRELS.

.@FrancisTeevin and I are discussing how, if our RP game was a TV show, the internet would ship our twin characters so hard.
@BillyDenton23 I can't write a shojo romance about a car that I personally wouldn't bang!
@BillyDenton23 I'm not INSULTING cars of different body shapes! They just aren't my preference!
@ChZuckBean Well, my hair was pretty sweet yesterday. And you're always welcome to touch it. I won't bite. xD
@ChZuckBean That's why I always touch your face, Chuck. Because you're my friend.
I need my cars to be sleek and sexy, but with round, friendly headlights and blunt noses. I AM A WOMAN OF SPECIFIC CAR NEEDS.
I feel bad for @PrinceOfBrains trying to send me pictures of cars. "I don't like his eyes." "That once looks mean." "Too angular."
@BillyDenton23 The idea of Spidey doing humble brags and going to raves is just amazing. xD
This just makes me so happy. 
@emergency_fox "Aww marmot again? We wanted pizza!"
I'm going to learn to draw manga because I have too many ideas that need pictures. Stopping at the art shop after work for supplies.
@BigBardaFree This is the truest fact.
@_octillery I've watched the series but never read the manga!
Wet preserved tentacle with glitters! #motorcitynightmares 
So at #motorcitynightmares I bought some stuff from Doug Bradley and a couple DVDs and lots of beer. It was a totally awesome tme as always.
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen We can go to the gay party with Nina???

@MadniZilla @SharkPrinceRen Thanks~~!
@dosnostalgic Heck yes it is! Going to see Doug Bradley today~~
My hair is just too fucking sugoi right now. 
@BigBardaFree They would say this as I was wearing a screen accurate uniform and carrying a tricorder. Like I wasn't a fan.
@BigBardaFree I remember going to Trek cons as a kid and these gross dudes being like "UGH A LITTLE GIRL IS HERE WHY"
ALRIGHT I need to stop being lazy and start making myself pretty for public presentation. It'll take a half hour just to put in my contacts.
I just choked on my almond milk. 
Heading out to #MotorCityNightmares in a couple hours! Super excited, I love the people there. Everyone is so kind and awesome.
@BigBardaFree Kirk and Spock basically started slashfic. It is the opposite of a bro show.

&gt;  dammit
@_Jim_Moriarty__ It certainly is, Mr. Moriarty! Well caught!
Wake up two hours before my alarm with sniffles, sneezes, and watery eyes. Allergies are super.
@charllandsberg @ahoychrispineda Also, there have been female Transformers since G1. That dude is clueless and a bad nerd.
@dosnostalgic CD is awesome.
"I am the way." GODDAMN I LOVE HELLRAISER III.
Watching some Heckraiser III before seeing Doug Bradley again tomorrow at #motorcitynightmares! #Hellraiser
@BillyDenton23 I will, thank you!
I have to attend my daughter's birthday party today. As the host, that means making small talk with other parents. Guhhhhh.
@latentelegy Haha thanks! :D
@latentelegy Oh yeah, I painted that :)
Also, I'm trapped under a cat. 
@ben_304 Thank you! :D
Lying in bed, enjoying a lazy morning. Thought I'd share a picture of some of the cool stuff on my walls. 
Kise crying in the season one finale is killing me. #KurokoNoBasket #KurokosBasketball

This is beautiful. 
I bought a basketball today. I am v serious. It smells nice and reminds me of my childhood. My shooting range will be the entire court.
I just ate a cookie and, for the first time in over a year, it didn't hurt. Dental appointments might be awful, but the results are awesome.

The entire left side of my face is numb so I'm taking advantage by talking to my cat solely in Rocky Balboa quotes. #StalloneIsAmazingIDGAF
Hahaha yeah dentist it's super funny that I have cavities because I haven't had insurance and dental work is expensive hahaha
Yo Michigan government, could we stop tax breaks for the rich instead of raising sales tax? Because it would make way more sense.
Listening to Soundwave to calm my nerves. #Decepticon #husbando #Transformers 
Dental Appointment Two: The Fillening in an hour. Woke up nauseous and hoping I don't puke on the dentist. Whee~~

New article by our senior editor


@therobotjane It's been super relaxing to just do tech stuff all day, alone. No customers, just wires. *happy sigh*
I've been secluded in the server room all day, doing clean installs. Sometimes my job isn't terrible and stressful.
The area I'm from has no markers, which I find strange. The part of NC that my family is from? Many, many markers. 
@EHCB Close, I'm in the server room of the public library where I work.
Ahahaha #techlife #WindowsXP 
More clearly necessary items. 
@spaceliontobi This beat ass old monitor was the only one I could find that works xD
Better make some important calls on this ancient, broken phone we clearly still need while I'm waiting. #techlife

The RP characters that @SharkPrinceRen and I made for this Potterverse haven't even been accepted and we're already speculating situations.
@TheMadWelshman You'd think they would install a tank area at least. That would just widen their consumer base!
@SharkPrinceRen I'm sorry D:
@TheMadWelshman It's hard to get to the theatre when you're a giant squid. Also, the concession stand prices are outrageous!
@TheMadWelshman Aaaand now we're stuck.
@SharkPrinceRen Art show?
@TheMadWelshman Me too! Cephalopod buddies!
Sadface.
Now to watch Game of Thrones, play WoW, or sit here idly refreshing Twitter for hours? 
Probably all three, tbh.
@RonnieFilyaw I hope Robomom heals quickly!
@RonnieFilyaw Turn your child into the mirror-universe evil kid you know they can be!
@latentelegy The idea of speaking to people or using Skype online makes me very nervous. So, forums it is!
@latentelegy I don't blame them at all. I just miss it.
@latentelegy I can only attend bi-weekly because of having a kid/shitty car/no gas money. They all wanted to move to weekly.
@latentelegy I've been making graphics and picking songs for my character and crying a lot and the game isn't until July.
@latentelegy After a change in schedules, I could no longer attend my group. My DM recently invited me to the one-shot anniversary game. --
@latentelegy Same. I mean, I write and whatnot, but it's not the same without the input of others to flesh it out. I'm spoiled.
@latentelegy I'm going actually insane without the outlet of playing pretend, so I've been driven to this by desperation.
@latentelegy That is 100% accurate, yes.
@latentelegy OH GOD WHAT IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG AND THEY JUST LAUGH AND LAUGH AND LAUGH
@latentelegy *noodle noodle noodle*
@latentelegy Dude, I had a panic attack submitting my application to a group ahaha
WHY YES, YES I AM THANKS FOR NOTICING "I'm a giant squid! What's your Earth Day #GoogleDoodle quiz animal? 
@latentelegy WHY???
@latentelegy A Sandshrew, basically.
@latentelegy You should DM a Dragon Age RP group so I can join! XD
I just submitted my application to join a Potterverse RP group. So, I mean, there's that.
This is amazing. 
Losing my RP group is like a sad breakup. Like, I'm trying to move on, but am convinced I'll never do better. They were perfect.
I want monsters, adventure, intrigue, AND romance! Am I selfish/delusional?
I miss roleplaying a lot. Are there any online RP situations that are...good? Seems either SMASH MONSTERS or BANG WOLVERINE are the options.
How to break the news that you're going to @NightValeRadio live to see @CecilBaldwinIII! @SharkPrinceRen #NightVale

@BigBardaFree Oh, I understand, it just sucks to be in that position in the first place.
@BigBardaFree How's this belief: the sex lives of consenting adults are never your business #YourPatienceIsAstounding
@RonnieFilyaw Did he see the comics you made about him? Is that why he's upset?
OH BY THE WAY reason I couldn't find the fucking duck that keeps waking me up? FUCKER IS ON THE ROOF. 
@SharkPrinceRen That might have been it? It was coming from that side of the library right after storytime.
what do u smell
get a lil whiff
hehe can u tell
its a cake 
4 goodness sake
i hope ur feelin well
DID THE DUCK FOLLOW ME TO WORK? IS IT IN THE LIBRARY? WHAT THE FUCK IS--- oh it's some kid with a book i see
Some kid is playing with a book that quacks and I'm pretty sure I have duck-based PTSD after the past few mornings bc I got enraged.
@BigBardaFree I'm just imagining it super deadpan and unhappy and that is hilarious to me I'm sorry

.@SharkPrinceRen is giving me hair counseling so I can look like Shouyou Hinata forever. #Haikyuu 
@SharkPrinceRen YES DO THAT
@SharkPrinceRen That would be so dreamy.
@SharkPrinceRen None of that made sense to me. I DO NOT KNOW YOUR FOREIGN TERMS.
@MadniZilla @SharkPrinceRen My solution is basically always JUST CUT IT ALL OFF &lt;3
@MadniZilla Oooooo, sounds like it will be super cute and fun!
@SharkPrinceRen How would I cut my hair to make it look like Haikyuu's all the time? Because I feel like it's too long on top at the moment?
@SharkPrinceRen Okay, I'm your best senpai but he's my best senpai because I can't be my own senpai! (Can I???)
@MadniZilla AND YES CUTEST FACE
@MadniZilla Pwa? 
@SharkPrinceRen Micool-senpai is best senpai!
@MadniZilla Okay, number one your face is fucking cute and doesn't need anything. Do a cute undercut maybe if you want it mostly gone?
@SharkPrinceRen She was so pissed off, it was delightful. Princess-senpai's response: "Should I turn it up then or...?" &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@SharkPrinceRen "What is that? It's awful!"
"It's Portal and actually you're awful and it's great shut up"
"grumblegrumblegrumble"
@latentelegy huehuehue sounds great
My boss is blasting Still Alive from his desk and it's pissing off my coworker and it's so awesome I love this guy
@MadniZilla Step one: cut off hair
Step two: don't care what it looks like
Step three: cute messy boy hair game
FYI if you "support Detroit" but you only care about the trendy parts, you don't support the community, you support gentrification.

@seedavez She deserves it for being rude. Now she has to live with the image of muscular Highlanders having /intimate relations/.
@latentelegy He is pretty dreamy....
@latentelegy Do those other things then? Write some DA fics! That's kind of like playing... xD
@latentelegy But that's okay! Drink your tea, pet your cat, read some smut, play Dragon Age! JUST ENJOY IT.
She came back to read over my shoulder again! Lady, no one is buying your disapproving clucks. You love gay erotica.
Lady I work with just got an eyefull of Highlander slashfic and got all upset. That's what you get for reading over ppl's shoulders. Rude.
"Youre not like other girls" the 2nd is not nor ever…
Also, spot on about Raphael. Pardon me while I feel bad about myself for a while.

@latentelegy I didn't know you were into sexy vampire music or I could have helped you /ages/ ago.
@latentelegy Glad to be of service ;p
@SharkPrinceRen AHAHAHA
@SharkPrinceRen Good lord! He could palm that kid's entire torso xD
So, here's this sweet #EDM band that's delightfully 80s sounding and you should probably check them out: @ddandmv
@SharkPrinceRen Flap those yaoi hands to get that ethereal breeze!
@borderlinefemme I haven't brushed my hair in a week. Sure, it's short, but that's beside the point.
Doctor Who RPG fic done. WoW break before attempting to re-tackle the Highlander fic for @latentelegy. Puveyor of Smut, that's me.
@damianfoxart Likewise. It even creeps into my writing. I find myself describing how people smell &amp; feel more than how they look.
I had a friend who used charcoal shampoo. Every time I am reminded of him, that's the first thing I think of. It's painful &amp; heartwrenching.
It bothers me sometimes how much scent affects memory.

@BillyDenton23
@latentelegy This is the worst life. I'm going to make up my own words for buttholes. I will save the world from this plague.
@SharkPrinceRen If I were there, I'd be like YO THAT'S MY LITTLE BROTHER SO FUUUUUUCK YOOOOOOU
@SharkPrinceRen You don't look like a girl. You look like a perfect little elven shark prince who is too handsome for gross old guys.
@SharkPrinceRen Looks like you're developing that allergy to old men. :( I'm sorry this person was scummy to you.
@latentelegy I currently have "He felt the head of Erasmus’ cock pushing against his WHY ARE THERE NO GOOD WORDS FOR ASSHOLE" on this doc.
@latentelegy GUUUH
@Five_Three Ruby starfruit is my ironic favorite! xD
@Five_Three Pucker, rosebud, etc are too flowery. Entrace, hole, and asshole are too lewd. I need something in between.
@Five_Three Personally, when I read ugly words in my erotica, it kills my girl-boner. Like, ick, you couldn't phrase that better?!
@Five_Three I don't think any of those are pleasant sounding! This is the problem I'm having!
I know @BigBardaFree and @latentelegy read/write a lot of smut so maybe y'all can help me out. &gt;_____&gt;
hello twitter friends
what is a sexy word for a butthole? like in fiction
nothing too flowery, like "peach blossom"
but also not crude
thx
@latentelegy No.
I just watched a Japanese tea ceremony! @RonnieFilyaw 
@BillyDenton23 Basically yes.
The carnival across the street is CRANKING "Into The Night" like, dudes who are here to pick up teens, it's fiiiine. #wtfmusicchoices
@dosnostalgic That's the one!
"What? I don't wanna be fragged!" 
@ChZuckBean @UnseenPerfidy Worms, fish, eels.... You people, swear. Not enough legs, too many legs. You're legsists.
@ChZuckBean @UnseenPerfidy SNAKIES ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO WHAT IS WITH YOU PEOPLE GODDAMN
@UnseenPerfidy Spiders love you and want to eat the bugs that don't!
@UnseenPerfidy What do you have against the spider people? They're more afraid of you then you are of them.
@unintelligibl3 Also this is from the Parasyte manga and it will never stop making me laugh.

@UnseenPerfidy YES. DEAL WITH IT.
@UnseenPerfidy Ridiculously adorable!
@d_m_elms 
@latentelegy (Aside from the occasional dub of Spirited Away, but that's ONLY because @JasonMarsden is a dream.)
@latentelegy I could never do that to you, baby.
@tedraimi I haven't seen you since your signing at Green Brain, which was too long ago! Come to Detroit more ;D 
Sign into FB to use messenger. Pissed off at the first post I see. I'm so glad I migrated to Twitter. I love you, friends.
100% delightful. 
@TheMadWelshman No, that's delightful. This is delightful.
@latentelegy Do this. Do the thing.
Yes. All of this, yes. 
Chewie-senpai~~

@latentelegy I just know I'll be miserable for a few days. And I love food.
I'm going to play WoW for a minute to unwind then take a notebook down to the river and write about water for a while. It's lovely out.
@BillyDenton23 Instead I was just hella snarky back and she shut up.
@BillyDenton23 I should have Za Warudoed the mean dentist and claimed her teeth for my own.
I only cried once and that was because I gagged. The tech was super nice but the actual dentist was rude. Ah well.
Dentist results:
Some cavities, nothing too bad. They'll be taking all four of my wisdom teeth in one go, which sucks. Overall not terrible.
If I was concerned about my faves being problematic I wouldn't have any faves because goddamn I love fictional trash creep villains.
@SharkPrinceRen CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP
@SharkPrinceRen So chew it harder goddamn

@latentelegy Likewise, pretty waifu~~ &lt;3
@latentelegy I am here for you.
@ChZuckBean Sleeps are good D: I know I have a wisdom tooth that needs to go but they won't operate tomorrow, I'm sure. It'll be x-rays.
@BillyDenton23 I WILL
@latentelegy @BigBardaFree Probably.
I have a dental appointment tomorrow and I've been crying about it for days and it's awful. I'm such a baby.
@latentelegy I feel like you and @BigBardaFree have some things to discuss.
Literally me. 
I feel like a pusher.

@SharkPrinceRen I had a lady ask me what I was referring to when I said "mouse."
@SharkPrinceRen *sinister finger waggle, creepy voice* They're magic. #MySolution
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen HAHAHAHA GOOD. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@RonnieFilyaw "I don't believe that these eggs are feeling emotions. But neither do I."
Example, my Doctor Who RP character gets:
Iron Man by Die Krupps
Blind in Darkness by Diary of Dreams
Mirror in the Bathroom by English Beat
I also tend to assign songs to characters! Sometimes entire playlists! They help me define emotions and trap the mood when writing.
My writing style has a lot of fragmented sentences littered with commas because that's how my mind works. And I love it.
@SharkPrinceRen Yuuup. It's yelling into an empty hole and maybe someone hears the echos but idk whatever
@SharkPrinceRen It's okay. They're used to it.
@TheAngryFangirl Complaining about generalizations is just assuaging their own guilt, not a meaningful contribution to a discussion.
When you're having trouble writing, write through the problem. Make yourself write. If it sucks, you can clean it up later.
The book dust makes me sneezy. The old white men make me break out in sarcasm and condescension. #libraryallergies

@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy You have to have a great butt to wear a kilt. Therefore all Scotsmen have great butts?
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy The luscious curve of his shadow ass.
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy Shadow Duncan already left a jizzy snail-trail on Duncan's manly hip.
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy Evil Duncan's shadowy asscrack full of seductive shadows and also darkness.
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy Dripping is....less bad. xD
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen Yo I found a picture of Evil Duncan's ass. 
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy Penises shouldn't weep. That's scary. No weeping, no anger from penii.
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy NO THAT'S WEIRD.
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen Aching with need.

@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen THEY ARE ALREADY THROBBING WITH THE HEAT OF THEIR EMBRACE WAIFU GODDAMN
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen I'm struggling to describe Duncan MacLeod's dick x2 so idk if that's a good thing or...?
Both @latentelegy and @SharkPrinceRen are fanfic enablers. ENABLERS I TELL YOU. NAUGHTY, AWFUL ENABLERS.
@latentelegy Ahahaha, perfect response?
@UnseenPerfidy I bought a PS3 at launch + games. That was like...$900. Does the value depreciate when prices drop or...?
@latentelegy I'm at 2500 words and they aren't banging yet. I just thought you should know.
@DrNerdLove Right? Every day of my life, I think, "I could be making millions off of silly smut, if only I could live with myself."
@DrNerdLove Geez, way to call out someone's self-esteem problems! ;p What about the gay billionaire dinosaur one?
@DrNerdLove Have you read the erotic story about the woman and Clippy?
@progeer I didn't even lose sleep for something fun. Insomnia sucks.

I am waaaaay too old to function on three hours of sleep.
friends
i was so tired and wanted to sleep
but now i cannot
insomnia and noisy brains are bad
and i hope you do not have them too
@BigBardaFree Sometimes? Idk. Sometimes I feel like realdolls would be less hassle.
@neilcameron Mellow greetings, what's your boggle?
The "fuck you, lady!" kid from #DemolitionMan is the best part.
I love how the "utopia is boring" future trope died out when the economy got shitty again. #DemolitionMan
For our three year anniversary, @princeofbrains got me the Peach #amiibo that I didn't have yet and a… 
@BillyDenton23 Thank you.
@ubersaurus Joshrasmus. ;p However, Kincaid is shippable, but not Robocaid. Kirk is unshippable.
@UnseenPerfidy &lt;3 
I told my DM that I might write a smutfic about some of the characters from the Doctor Who game &amp; he sent me a happy taco sticker?
@AlongsideWild I thought so, but I thought it best to ask an expert. Thank you!
@AlongsideWild Garter snake? My daughter found him in a puddle while playing. We put him back where we found him. :) 
@MadniZilla Note: my boss is like 60 and built like a momma bear. It was amazing to see her all giggling about BATMAN'S SENSUAL LIPS.
@MadniZilla One time my boss and I subjected the other library employees to a rant about Bruce Wayne's sensual lips... &gt;__&gt;
@BigBardaFree in a romantic fashion.
@BigBardaFree You know, I've written a lot of smut. No angry dicks. No nerve bundles. Although I did waffle for days on how to say "asshole"
@BigBardaFree Ahahaha what. If that's what it's like, something has gone terribly wrong.
@FauxBenBen @kelseyr713 I should probably just Twitch a Jade Empire playthrough. xD
@kelseyr713 They're really pretty and lithe. I like them. :D Also, always replay Jade Empire!
@kelseyr713 They were in Heaven after you talk to the fox spirit in the dark forest near the flooded town. *nodnod*
Writing Highlander fic in one tab, discussing Doctor Who fic in another. What has happened to me? Repeats to self: all practice is good.
@SassyEverlarkin You don't have to like any new terms, but you aren't the language police so these ppl can get off their high horse, imho.
@latentelegy Other languages have those! And it's great! English is dumb :&lt;
@latentelegy Right?! It's a pronoun mess. We need a language that's better at this.
@latentelegy They and their always sound wrong to me when writing, because I'm used to those being plural pronouns &gt;___&lt;
@SharkPrinceRen GODDAMN DUNCAN, PULL YOUR OWN HAIR AND CALL YOURSELF DADDY FUUUUCK
@SharkPrinceRen It's like five steps past twincest, yo. It's so bad. Duncan is like NO IT'S WRONG and Evil is like WHO WANTS TO BE RIGHT???
@SharkPrinceRen Exactly! "His waves of thick, dark hair..." YEAH THEY BOTH HAVE THAT YEAH
Discussing how mean Duncan is being to Evil Duncan with @SharkPrinceRen is keeping me going. XD @latentelegy 
@BillyDenton23 That's why I undertook this in the first place. I need to practice, practice, practice and any practice is good.
@TheMadWelshman I'm trying to write a Highlander fic at the request of a friend and I'm so out of my normal territory. But it's a challenge!
Example: "He touched his chest." Whose? His own or the other guy's? THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW
Same sex fics are a pain to write because there's pronoun ambiguity so you have to say the characters' names a lot.
The first issue of the new #Reanimator comic is great! I read all of West's dialog in @jeffreycombs voice. As it should be.
@SharkPrinceRen Well, I am the biggest...
@SharkPrinceRen We should have a bird meeting to establish this.
@SharkPrinceRen Barb is the lowest in the pecking order.
90% of my interactions with @SharkPrinceRen are me pretending to knock his stuff on the ground.
OHMSS is love. 
@UnseenPerfidy Whenever I see some terrible group failing I'm filled with NO. YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. villain pride.
This tweet speaks to me on a spiritual level. 
meet throbbing hot groins in your area
@latentelegy Well, Evil Duncan's hair is more slicked back and severe so his stays in. But Proper Duncan's locks are released into the wild.
I need to work on slowly building tension in stories. I always feel like I write the build really boringly so I tend to rush. THAT'S NO GOOD
@latentelegy He's already running his fingers through Duncan's hair and murmuring trashtalk to him, what more does Duncan want?!
@latentelegy So I guess this is a mirror self dubious consent story.
@latentelegy Duncan has a total hard-on for his evil, animalistic self but he thinks that it's super gross and is disgusted. xD
@latentelegy I would think that with himself, he'd already know what Duncan wants and would be more straightforward.
@latentelegy In the episode, he's really sweet and seductive to the lady he bangs because her husband cheated him out of some money BUT
I was writing Evil Duncan as seductive and sinister, but I think he'd be more lewd and dismissive. Thoughts @latentelegy?
WHY ARE YOUR BOOKS SO EXPENSIVE??
Yo, our sale paperbacks are $0.50. New they would be $8. stfu
#library
@latentelegy cry 5eva
@latentelegy Truth. But then, Sarah should've ended up with Jareth. And Molly Ringwald with Duckie. I think writers do this on purpose.
@unintelligibl3 What if it's like
sam is queer*
*by that I mean really really queer
?
@latentelegy (Seriously, I heard that song as the Phantom saying to Christine "I'll be what you need, let's leave the sewers.") *sobbing*
@latentelegy LET ME LEAD YOU FROM YOUR SOLITUDE
@latentelegy I will never forgive Raoul for that.
@latentelegy When I was a kid, I only had the soundtrack and I thought All I Ask Of You was sung by Christine and the Phantom.
Raoul is literally the worst. #PhantomOfTheOpera
@BigBardaFree Whenever people talk to me about boys, I talk to them about Joseph Joestar, Petyr Baelish, and Kuroko until they stop.
HAPPY THREE YEAR ANNIVERSARY @PrinceOfBrains! YOU'RE A PRETTY COOL BOYFRIEND!
@RonnieFilyaw Okay, "give me Nippon or give me desu" made me laugh way too hard for this early in the morning.
Two mice named Biggs and Wedge just got a cat that's also a donut stuck in a Rube Goldberg machine. #anime

@latentelegy Before LJ, I posted a lot to Detroit Freenet. #hellaold
@latentelegy YUP. My first LJ was...1999?
@latentelegy Seriously, my best friend is like a decade younger than me and I'm over here like YOU DON'T REMEMBER LIVE JOURNAL
@latentelegy I knew what it meant so idk? Maybe we're both just old xD
@latentelegy It was slow this morning, so I got started, but then delivery came wahhhhh~~
@latentelegy Give your penis to the darkness, Duncan! Seriously, though, it got busy at work and now I'm mad I can't write rn xD
Talking about Duncan MacLeod's hairy buttcrack and Eiffel 65 songs. You are good today, twitter dot com.
@latentelegy Drawing Duncan in to its shadowy depths!
@dosnostalgic OMEGA BOOST! BLOODY ROAR! X-FILES! ALL OVER THE WORLD!
@dosnostalgic Guh whatever. My Console was a better song anyway. -__-
@dosnostalgic "Ain't got nobody to listen to / I'm blue" It even rhymes! It's totally there. I listened to that song a billion times.
@latentelegy Can't wait to describe Shadow Duncan's shadowy cleft bc that's a hairy man, it will be hella shadowy.
@dosnostalgic Yes, there is o__o 
@latentelegy Shadowy Shadow fingers xD
@dosnostalgic Cuz he ain't got nobody to listen to?
@latentelegy I'm just calling the Evil Duncan "Shadow" for the sake of differentiation. It's lame, but w/e.
@latentelegy "The Evil Duncan, the Shadow of the Dark Quickening, moved toward the wary form of Duncan with an unmistakable swagger."
@UnseenPerfidy I'd rather mental illness was rebranded generally so that everyone with a mental illness wasn't seen as dangerous.
@UnseenPerfidy Probably "heavy" since it can't be cured with rainbows and puppies. Siiiiigh.
I've never written a fic with an angry power bottom before so I just idk but whatever? I blame @latentelegy for this situation.
"Someone understood him once but then she died"

@gordonj2k When you're "crazy", you're worthless in the eyes of society and will do anything to feel valuable even if it's only briefly.

@gordonj2k Because women with mental illnesses are more easily taken advantage of and have lower self-esteem. Consequently, they make...
In lighter news TAXES ARE DUE TOMORROW SO GIVE ME EVERY FORM AND DO MY TAXES FOR ME PLZZZZ #librarypatronstoday
How fucked up is that? Bc that was the way I saw girls with mental problems treated, that was my self-worth. Good for crazy sex.
Again LRTs: I embraced the shit out of that crazy-girl sex kitten shit when I was younger bc I thought it was the only way I'd be wanted.
LRTs: I'm not BPD, I'm bipolar, but I've run into this. It's hella gross. My mental issues aren't hot, they scare me and suck. Thx.
@latentelegy One page down of this Highlander fic and Evil Duncan hasn't even shown up yet. #sobored
My work day will be: cutting scrap paper into smaller pieces, rolling coins, and writing fanfic. I'm so glad I have a job where I'm useful.
I'm pretty sure Jackson Park Express is my current favorite @alyankovic song. #stillstuckintraffic
The freeway might be at a complete standstill but at least the sky is pretty this morning? 
@TheWookieeRoars She's precious, Peter! Congrats to you and yours!
I found this draped over my daughter's 3DS. Apparently she felt I needed an illustration. XD 
@HalSparks I know it's a satire site, I was just amused by the sudden presence of Sparks-butt. ;p
@latentelegy You know, I guessed that ;p
@latentelegy oh hai there
Because I'm a good friend and writing at work keeps my brain from atrophy, I'm writing a DuncanXEvilDuncan fic for @latentelegy tomorrow.
@HalSparks Is this your nekkid butt in a Christwire article? xD 
@latentelegy I'll try to get it done tomorrow xD I'll link you when it's finished. It will be purposely campy, most likely.
@latentelegy I should probably write this while I'm at work tomorrow. I can't write anything deeper than trashfic while helping customers.
@latentelegy With a nasty smirk thrown over his shoulder that clearly says, "You're only doing this because I want you to."
@latentelegy I think he thinks that as long as he's telling someone to do it, then it doesn't count.
@latentelegy So he power bottoms xD
@latentelegy But Evil Duncan would be such a selfish lover!
@latentelegy Later this episode, Duncan and Evil Duncan wrestle and the loser has to be the bottom.
DUNCAN VS EVIL DUNCAN! MIRROR MATCH!! #HighlanderMonday
@latentelegy RUN HIM THROUGH WITH HIS NOBLE SWORD
@latentelegy Methos is gonna give Duncan that little death.
@latentelegy "Methos, if you kill me, you become me. A creature of evil, soulless evil. And unrepentant passion."
@latentelegy I assume it's roughly the same as the number of "didn't get back to Vulcan in time" SpockXKirk fics.
I wonder how many MethosXDuncan fics take place during this stupid Dark Quickening scene. @latentelegy?
Evil Duncan is the worst plot line so far in Highlander. #HighlanderMonday
I will always cry when Sylvanas sings the Lament of the Highbourne. #noshame #thatsmygirl #worldofwarcraft
@StephenMangan Stay very still! They can only see movement!
@Five_Three Less wine and urine, but yes, basically xD
@Five_Three Last week was total garbage, so I'm taking a self-care Monday. I'll probably do some writing and day drinking later!
Enjoying my day off. Played some video games. Cuddled up with blankets. About to read for a while. So relax, much quiet.
I can't speak for God, but I can for Spidey.

@RonnieFilyaw Personally, I love Sixlets but only because I ate them a lot as a kid. I eat Sixlets out of misplaced nostalgia.
@FastFurious And Ramsey now! They're both so brilliant! :D
I probably just ate a whole bag of hummus chips but those are basically healthy, right?
@BigBardaFree That's silly. Cosplay what you want!
@SharkPrinceRen I don't know the term for little brother! Oni-kun?

@BigBardaFree Do it. Stab someone.
We were discussing violence against trans women by cis men and he was baffled that some men would react that way.
My teen son just told me that if he was with a girl &amp; found out she was trans he'd say, "That's cool, whatever." So proud rn.
@d_m_elms I'd be so glad to read it. Thank you! :)
@TheTaskForce As a cis woman, excluding our trans sisters is disgusting. Trans women are women. I'm incredibly disappointed.
I got a bunch of books on writing stuff. Been playing with my super cute hair. Finished new school paperwork. Productive day.

This is what victory looks like. I spent half an hour lost trying to find this #FiveGuys. 
@Five_Three I've got two of em but only one lives with me. I was trying to do school, work, and kid and it wasn't happening. So internet!
Enrollment complete for expensive online college that lets me keep working and being a parent! At least I'll get my degree. Sigh.

Nothing I love more than having to make a bunch of important phone calls when I'm already upset and anxious.

I'm on the verge of tears right now and struggling to keep it together because I just goddamn hate my job so much. I feel trapped &amp; useless.
"If you're in my house, you have to pay attention to me!" Whoever was ignoring you had the right idea. Get over yourself.
Sorry dude, but repression, racism, sexism, and homophobia aren't Moral Values. You're just a stupid fuckface.

The worst part of my job, worse than the group homes making messes or the violently unstable people threatening my personal safety,
I kind of need this game. 
3600 words about a roleplaying character from a game I'm not even a part of anymore. At least I'm writing?
I think perhaps that it is time for me to go jot down sleepy, drunk thoughts so I can be shocked when I find them in my notebook later.
@gordonj2k At least I'll be rotting into a puddle in good company. &lt;3
I've just been idly refreshing twitter for the past several minutes bc I'm tired and bored but can't be arsed to move.

@SharkPrinceRen Of course &lt;3
@SharkPrinceRen It's alright. Maybe I'll get a different piercing in November or whatever xD
@SharkPrinceRen I reopened it when I tried to switch my jewelry, remember? :(
@SharkPrinceRen My own fault for compulsively playing with it. Shoulda known I was too twitchy for a face piercing.
@SharkPrinceRen I woke up this morning to it itching, gently tapped it and it started pouring blood. It was really swollen and infected.
I had to take out my nose piercing this morning and I'm really sad about it. I liked it a lot.
Nose piercing irritated due to jostling, apply ice, DEAR GOODNESS NOW THERE'S A PIECE OF COLD STEEL THROUGH MY NOSE THIS SUCKS

@unintelligibl3 YOU LOOK SO SOFT
You know your ass has never seen tragedy or discrimination when you think that a plea for equal rights = the fucking Gestapo.

@SeenPerfidy You didn't.
@BillyDenton23 Ain't that the truth.
I think I had too much to drink so I'm going to play WoW now. At least I'm in Dustwallow so I can't fall off Thunderbluff this time~~
@TheNthDoctor Clearly! That's why your bones are so brittle!
@bpblack647 @AidanGillenFans It's on Audible, which is through Amazon. $5.99 or free with 30-day trial. :D
@unintelligibl3 He deleted his account due to drama and personal problems.
@bpblack647 @AidanGillenFans True, but listening to him read military strategy in his rumbling voice was basically the best.
@unintelligibl3 So soft, much pets.
@TheNthDoctor @JohnCena Ahahahahah! Only took three hours ;p
Or maybe because it's cheap and doesn't taste awful idk w/e
Semi-related, I really enjoy Busch Copper Lager, despite how cheap it is.
90% of my interactions on Twitch are me typing something, deciding its not that funny or I'm too drunk to be talking, and deleting it.
@MadniZilla I haven't read them since I was...17? (Which was 14 years ago...) So I'm willing to give it a shot if only for nostalgia. xD
@MadniZilla Uhhh sooo were you aware that Rice is releasing a fourth Beauty book? Because I was not.
Seriously, anyone who disagrees is wrong. And I will fight you.
Honestly, watching @RonnieFilyaw play Harvest Moon games is the most soothing thing. Great for anxiety and jumbles. He is the best.
@seedavez Ours is just a public library, but we have a pretty extensive graphic novel collection. I get to do purchasing, which rules.
@seedavez I work at a library, so I just wait for them to come out in TPB so I can order them with the library budget and read them :)
Warcraft or @whomptwitch....
Oh man, Ronnie is singing Nelly! I made the correct choice.
@latentelegy Not my thing either, but I like the money of strangers!
@latentelegy The Amazon crowd loves them some monster sex idk xD
@latentelegy I've released a series of ebooks about a girl that sleeps with cryptozoological monsters. No judgements here.
@latentelegy Sure, but (at least to me) there are few things hotter than awkwardness at the beginning of sexytimes soooo yeah.
@latentelegy I spent a lot of time thinking about Alistair's virginity &gt;___&gt;
@SeenPerfidy Get some rest, hun.
@latentelegy HOW DID YOU NOT REALIZE THIS??!

@latentelegy Something something pun about virginity. I want these perfumes btw.

WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THERE WAS A NEW BEAUTY BOOK?! 
@mtrc Awesome, thank you!
@mtrc That's fascinating! Did they publish? I'd like to read that.
@mtrc No problem! The theme of robot rights in sci-fi is kind of my thing. I blame early exposure to Armitage III ;)
@mtrc As far back as Asimov, to my knowledge. Maybe prior. It's a pretty common theme. :)

Yeah, okay, so I just made an Audible account solely to listen to Petyr Baelish read me The Art Of War. #DreamsDoComeTrue
@RonnieFilyaw The anime is fanservice-y too, but the art is better. I hope you like it. :) 
Twitch's facecam is disconcerting. It looks like @RonnieFilyaw is staring into my soul. Not that I'm complaining. It's just odd.

Today has been a yawning pit of unhappiness. I just want to sit on the beach in Durotar and fish and forget that I have a real life.

@TheMadWelshman  I'm okay as long as I don't think about it? But as soon as I do, I'm completely paralysed and sick and screaming. :(
@TheMadWelshman I have a deep water phobia, but I would really like to get over it. So, for now, the watery depths are awful :/
I think I want to live on a houseboat but then I'd live in constant terror of the watery depths full of monsters below me.

@UnseenPerfidy Like I'm pissed at internet atheists for making atheists as a group look like intolerant fuckbags.
@UnseenPerfidy I'd be pissed if a lot of my group were making me look bad or saying things like "you can't control yourself!"
@UnseenPerfidy The men who are making them look bad by being assholes.
@UnseenPerfidy What's funny is when men get all NOTALLMEN instead of taking a step back and getting mad at the ppl who deserve it:
@UnseenPerfidy Now I just get mad at internet atheists for making me look bad by proxy, instead of blaming the ppl they treat poorly.
@UnseenPerfidy Then I realize that I'd look like an asshole if I said that bc it's obviously not about me personally.
@UnseenPerfidy Every time I see someone complain about internet atheism I have this NOTALLATHEISTS kneejerk reaction.
Merry has ignored me all day. "Oh hey, I see you're sitting down to play some video games!"  Sigh.

@spaceliontobi Yup. They're getting all worked up and harassing Sir Roger over some bull Daily Mail made up.
I put a Lean Cuisine in the micro then ate all of my leftovers from dinner last night (half a burger and fries) in the 6min it took to cook.
@latentelegy I killed that kid so fast, then guilted Alistair into supporting my decision bwahaha
@latentelegy You know, I got into a huge fight with my ex when DAO came out bc I straight murdered that demon kid, Connor.
@SeenPerfidy You hide it well, at least on the interwebs :p
@latentelegy "Disconcertingly"? Psssssh.
@BillyDenton23 Yarp. Born and raised in London, can't get much more English.
@BillyDenton23 The interviewer said "do you think Bond should be English?" Roger said yes. Idris is English.
Seriously, your kid is reading. Shut up and be happy about that. Encourage them, it's not hard. Goddamn.
DO NOT insult your kid for reading comics 
This will turn them away from reading and cause self-esteem issues over their "stupid" interests
Okay, enough angry ranting. I apologize for that brief interlude.
@latentelegy He's so dreamy &lt;3
All @sirrogermoore said in the interview in question was that Bond should be English. He didn't even mention Idris Elba.
"Lazenby was the worst Bond!" Oh fuck off, did you see OHMSS? It was lovely. But no one can top @sirrogermoore.
Not to mention, all of these people have shit opinions about Bond just generally.
Seeing everyone grouch about @sirrogermoore in reference to a comment he clarified immediately is ruining Twitter for me today.

@BillyDenton23 That one is less inaccurate, at least.
Shifted somewhere in the realm of 10k books today so pardon while I eat a whole tin of black olives then have a lie down.
@latentelegy Same and I'm only a couple years older :p
@latentelegy Guhh I'm sorry you have to deal with it too D:
If there is a song less personally relatable than Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, I haven't heard it.
Repetitive bending is the bane of my existence. Getting old sucks &amp; I don't recommend it to anyone. Exercise when you're young! Stay limber!
@cthos Thank you! &lt;3
@cthos Basically.
@cthos I made it to the second round, but haven't gotten results for that yet. :(
@cthos Ehh I'm broke af right now, so no new tattoos until I either win some money or get my student aid refund xD
I want a UGM tattoo so hard. #Ultraman
#WeebClub Left to Right @ChZuckBean @PrinceOfBrains @SharkPrinceRen @BillyDenton23 and myself! #wrestling 
The timing for my fist pumps in the intro was so beautiful!
.@ChZuckBean made me in a wrestling game and called me Princess Piledriver and my theme was Get Your Body Beat by @combichristarmy &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@griffski @thelindsayellis @MaraWritesStuff Same here, Sarah. Fortunately there is hope and people can grow out of this mentality!
@JohnLeguizamo I saw that a whole building went up in flames. It was definitely crazy!
@yogabbagabba @alyankovic I want both of their outfits.
@Five_Three Next chapter is when Taelain gets bitten by the worgen and that's the part I'm looking forward to writing. That and nelf porn.
@Five_Three Oh sure! 
There. Chapter two of my WoW fic is up. Time to have a snuggle with my electric blanket.
@ChrisWarcraft That Christians are clueless and think that everyone exists only by their grace and forgiveness? &gt;___&lt;
I JUST WANT TO WRITE THE WORGEN/NELF SEX SCENES OKAY
So I'm only two chapters in to my WoW fic and I've only covered the first like...three worgen quests? This is gonna take forever...
You know, I've tried so hard and got so far, but in the end it didn't even matter. I hate celery. That's all I really wanted to say.
@progeer I'm on Twitter pretty regularly and you're welcome to text! :D
Can I just? Please? 
(Thanks to @progeer!)
@latentelegy Well thank you for the kudos and bookmarking! xD
Aside from times I've dyed my hair black, it's been red for many years.
Yesterday a coworker asked if I dyed my hair recently bc it "looks red now." Today, I had a man tell me he'd "rather be dead than red." wtf
@MaraWritesStuff Michigan isn't the worst? But it isn't great either.

*changes facebook status to "In a Relationship"
@spaceliontobi I left up the pic of Snoop making cute heart hands then just turned in my office chair and glared.
@latentelegy Are you "asrundream" on AO3? &gt;__&gt;
@TheNthDoctor 
Yes, racist lady at work, I am purposely looking at pictures of shirtless Snoop painting while you hover so I can offend you. Shoo.
@latentelegy *shoos the panic* go away mr panic
@SharkPrinceRen I got her to do the dropbox. :p
@SharkPrinceRen I want to. I mean, Joyce and Martha are here but they're not going to do opening stuff -__-
Eskil Simonsson's accent is even more pronounced in live recordings and I'm in heaven. #Covenant #EBM #Industrial
I have to open the library alone today and I'm procrastinating because I'm being a giant baby about it.
@latentelegy Yes, and I'm sorry you've got one today. :/
@TheNthDoctor lolololol
Joe Dawson/Methos, huh? Not my ship, but I respect your right to sail... &gt;__&lt;
@BaileyJayTweets Oh goodness yes! It's so interesting!
Tim: "Why does Megatron have a gun?"
Me: "To shoot people?"
Tim: "HE HAS AN ENERGON CANNON."
@PrinceOfBrains
90% of the Highlander fics on AO3 are Methos. The other 10% are Amanda. No one loves Duncan.
@MadniZilla Okay, idk if this is good bc I didn't actually read it but I thought of you &lt;3 
monetize your spiders
spiiiiiderssss
c u @ the crossroads #BoneThugs 
Waiting out rez sickness after trying to make a run into the Barrens. I JUST WANT TO GO TO RATCHET, ORCS. I AIN'T TRYINA FIGHT U.
Fuck Stonetalon. I'm going to Booty Bay. huehuehue
@MicroSFF This is breaking my heart.
@SharkPrinceRen O___o
Looking up quest lines to get the names of NPCs because fanfic. #SomeWoWTweets
@KaworuSenpai Hey @SharkPrinceRen, you need to see this.
@latentelegy Awww sheesh ^///^
@Five_Three There are lvl 27 quests in Ashenvale if you follow every last quest line, so no grays! XD
@ohnoghosts Hello there, Mr. Ghosts! I'd like to talk to you about a commission, I love your style! DM me please?
Today I learned that if you do /every single quest/ in Ashenvale, you can completely skip Stonetalon bc you'll be lvl 30 when ur done. &gt;__&gt;
@unintelligibl3 Maaaybe trans people have higher rates of PTSD because they grew up in a society that rejects them hmmmm
@latentelegy Hand written notes are more personal :p 
@latentelegy But it's so...emotive! And twirly but also pointy! It's purdy. (and yes i will be ur waifu)
@latentelegy You have pretty handwriting o__o
I've hit the age where I'd rather listen to the station playing Pink Floyd than the current alt rock station. Get these kids off my lawn!
Celebratory nap, over. I slept too long to hit the gym, so I guess it's free weights at home!
@ben_304 They are definitely the most superior of all naps.
Celebrating having the day off work by taking a nap. The rain pattering on my window is divine.
I used to think Godzilla was super amazing, and it is, but then I watched Ultraman 80 and whole new vistas have opened before me.
ME: regular yogurt could be melted frozen yogurt scully
AGENT DANA SCULLY: mulder…
@gordonj2k @PrinceOfBrains A typo I made when spelling gordita, which sounded like an Ultraman monster xD MONSTER GORDOTA
安っぽいタコスモンスター MONSTER GORDOTA
What will Ultraman do??!
I filed @PrinceOfBrains' taxes for him because I love data entry (&amp; him i guess). He's rewarding me with CHEESY MONSTER GORDOTAS. #tacobell
@MadniZilla Sounds like a fun(?) night!
@CohenDS Are you sure?? Maybe you're overreacting! ;p
@TheMadWelshman I think his eyes are fine! And he's just been playing some of the football he's got the helmet for to get that neck xD
@TheMadWelshman This is brilliant!
@rickygervais That is amazing.
@UnseenPerfidy Tequila got me through a terrible wedding once, so I owe it one.
@damianfoxart Oh goodness.
The internet really, really writing smut about Wrathion and Anduin Wrynn. Huh. #SomeWoWTweets
@BillyDenton23 You'll have to roll the dice to find out.
@BillyDenton23 Because it doesn't exist! It's not a thing!
@cthos It is absolutely my goal. If I can't be eating delicious burgers right now, everyone has to suffer with me.
@Abusitron Hey @PrinceOfBrains, I got you this tweet.
"A storm's comin"
[In the distance, Darude 'Sandstorm' can be heard faintly]
*Cowboy cracks a…
"Do you have any books about the mythos of Jumanji?" 
wtf no i dont goddamn
Now he's talking about Jumanji~~ D:
Nice old dude, quit talking to me about Amazon Prime so I can get back to reading my smutty fanfics~~
Just sitting at work reading some Night Elf/Troll smut, nbd, #SomeWoWTweets
@BillyDenton23 No, it is not. And I'm sorry.
Since the two people who have read my short #Hannibal fic really seemed to like it, here. 
@PrinceOfBrains Seems like they're speaking to you on a very personal level.
- bed
- car wash
- work bathroom
- closet of an ex
- Beyoncé concert
- mall basement
- Arby's
@Five_Three Forever Achewood responses &lt;3
@PrinceOfBrains OH NO 
Nothing I love more than getting yelled at for things that are completely out of my control. It's so awesome. Thank you, customers.
@UnseenPerfidy (I am kidding, I feel like I should clarify. JRPGs still love you.)
@UnseenPerfidy JRPGs aren't mad, Rob. They're just disappointed.
@UnseenPerfidy That is not a very JRPG decision that you made there, Rob. How can you take JRPGs on the bus with a PSTV? YOU CAN'T.
@UnseenPerfidy WHERE'S YOUR PSP ROB?!
@latentelegy Aww sheesh, thank you *blushblushblush*
@latentelegy Bwahaha well thank you :D :D :D
I am always afraid to write fics in fandoms I'm not THOROUGHLY VERSED in, lest I make mistakes and look a fool.
And I blame @latentelegy.
I want to write so many fanfictions.
@latentelegy Not my ship, but I respect your right to sail. &lt;3
@latentelegy Warning, it's super short and was written in a fit of Madsness.
@latentelegy It's called "wtf is wrong with you?!"
@latentelegy so i heard u liek hannibals 

I'm going to punch today in the throat and steal its lunch money.

#Pseudoscience poisons! 
Song of the morning:

@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen Dude, I'm on my phone and my computer is way over there D: I'll give you the link later!
@SharkPrinceRen @latentelegy Twinchan doesn't count, of course she does xD
@latentelegy @SharkPrinceRen I SURE DID
@latentelegy I was just introduced to it by @SharkPrinceRen, who wanted me to post my Hannibal fics &gt;__&gt;
@latentelegy @FauxBenBen I started headcannoning Warcraft stuff today so yeah we're both losers.
@latentelegy I have one! XD

Me: No it's not a pencil.

Oh, @netflix, you know me so well. &lt;3 
@nickb0l I think we're friends already?
@nickb0l I don't really know, since I don't talk to anyone. xD
@nickb0l I'm on Scryers! How do you upgrade the camera? You have to do the garrison mission to get it, then another garrison for the Mark 2.
@ben_304 I live with a man who owns many hundreds of Transformers. I am both understanding and forgiving of this type of thing, don't worry.
@ben_304 Alright. I'll take your word for it. But I'm keeping an eye on you.
@ben_304 You know, I'm starting to get the impression that you're making fun of me :p
@ben_304 Because, while I have the money, I really shouldn't waste it on something like that. Stupid being an adult.
@bibliobotic She's one of those dogs that's brown all over, even their noses. Those are my favorite dogs. &lt;3
@ben_304 That's the problem. That's what I'm doing. "OH GOD OLI WOULD LOOK SO CUTE IN A BILLION SELFIES!" "TAELAIN NEEDS THIS SO BAD!"
Seriously guys, I need your help. This is a problem I'm having.
@bibliobotic Your cute puppy pictures are killing me with adorableness.
Someone talk me out of upgrading to Warlords just to get a SELFIE camera. #SomeWoWTweets
@Five_Three @CNNMoney 75k for a housekeeper means you have 75k you can waste on something you could do your damn self. HARD KNOCK LIFE obvs
@latentelegy We'll have to keep your faithful dog away from the skeleton...
@latentelegy But then we can fight all the Darkspawn!
@latentelegy GAAAAASP
@latentelegy You'll have to do one of those boss fights where you fight your own shadow!!
@latentelegy that just means you do not know yourself .____.
@spaceliontobi Aww thanks Tobi! You too!
@latentelegy @sproutella Ahahaha, what? YOU DON'T KNOW ME
@Expedia @VisitBritain 1) You guys are killing it. Adorable campaign! &lt;3 2) Notice there's less hate in the comments for the lesbians? &gt;__&lt;
@StephenMangan @realDonaldTrump He looks like he's having a poo...
@latentelegy If I ever get there, you're welcome to come visit :)
@latentelegy I have no problem taking a ferry if I live on an island with an awesome microclimate.
@latentelegy Victoria is where I'm looking. It's gorgeous there.
@latentelegy Je parle français un peu. Puis-je avoir un taco?
@latentelegy I speak passable enough French to ask for food, so I think I'll survive. Plus, if I go, I'm going west coast Canada.
@latentelegy I don't mind the French. Hairy, big-nosed dudes are pretty great.
@latentelegy You're right. Here it's just awful and classist. I'm moving to Canada. At least they have health care.
@latentelegy Preach. It's the worst.
@latentelegy I'm not moving anywhere yet xD I'm just not staying in Michigan forever because fuck this place.
When I leave Michigan I will miss blue moon ice cream and Vernor's. I'll miss glottal stops and our need to make every shop name possessive.
@damianfoxart I was Horde from vanilla through Cata, but my first character in beta was a Nelf. I wanted to try the races I'd never played.
I just /flirted with a Nelf NPC and my worgen felt it necessary to tell him that she has 6 nipples. She's as good at flirting as I am. /sigh
Also, my love for the Nelf starting zones suckered me into renewing my #WoW subscription. Siiiigh.
All I've put in my body today is a granola bar, blue moon ice cream, and beer. I guess I'm saving all of my nutrients up for dinner.
@CharlTaylorPage @louistheroux Definitely not the only one.
@Expedia @VisitBritain Adorable couple, way to go Expedia! &lt;3
@GameOfThrones I wish Baelish wasn't so gorgeous, so I could hate him properly.
There are some teens sitting by me talking about modern practical effects in horror movies and I'm trying so hard not to interject.
Blue moon #icecream: the pro's choice. #Michigan #Strohs 
@MadniZilla I've found that applying for jobs is the most depressing and defeatist way to be productive.
@latentelegy I KNOOOW &lt;3
@BillyDenton23 @angelspit Gothsicles are playing too, which is pretty cool.
@BillyDenton23 Sooo @angelspit is playing Small's on May 24th &gt;__&gt;
@latentelegy I'll just leave this picture of my buddy Jovan here... 
Me: "... yes?"
@latentelegy Alistair is beautiful. Just sayin'.
@Expedia @VisitBritain Amazing, Expedia! Adorable couple &lt;3
@Five_Three Agreed. If delicious food doesn't cause a nearly-sexual reaction, you're not enjoying eating nearly enough.
Maybe it's offputting to some people when I refer to food in blatantly sexual ways?
@CharlTaylorPage Also an acceptable solution!
@Five_Three @steakNstiffarms Eat? I'd take that thing home and make it breakfast.
@CharlTaylorPage So you're at the "put the next round in a sippy cup" level?
In other news, I am wearing a t-shirt that has a rad punk rock wolf in a leather jacket so basically I'm cooler than you.
I got a cute hoop for my nostril piercing and it's the wrong diameter then my piercing swelled and it hurt to put my post back in. #wahh
Merry, getting superior-grade pets from @princeofbrains #cats #blackcats 
I feel like I spend a inordinate amount of time explaining to my cat that, no, she does not want my veggie burgers.
@latentelegy And thank goodness :D
@ben_304 Aww now I feel so special!
@ben_304 I still use Twitter favorites like Facebook likes because I was on FB for years before Twitter. &gt;___&gt;
@ben_304 NO ONE LOVES YOU, FACEBOOK. DEAL WITH IT.
However, the Nelf areas post-Cata still break my heart. I'm such a baby. I miss Auberdine.
World of Warcraft: Where everyone sucks and nothing I do matters.
I am enjoying the worgen starting quests.
@ben_304 Fortunately, I removed the FB app from my phone so I can check back in a few days at my leisure. Let them know I don't love them.
Also, anyone who enjoys wrestling should watch this. 
I have to thank @TheNthDoctor because I can't stop listening to this. 
@ben_304 Considering that I haven't been on FB in three months, it's probably more like HOLY SHIT SHE POSTED SOMETHING
@Silver_Kiden That's the one! I love him, he's such a goober!
@ben_304 HI BEN HOW ARE YOU I AM HERE AND EXIST I KNOW IT'S SHOCKING
I changed my profile picture on Facebook for the first time in months and now everyone wants to talk to me D:
The nice priest from M*A*S*H is in this episode of #MurderSheWrote! I love him! #LadyInTheLake
Tamago kake gohan #JapaneseFood 
Couples who make out at the gym: you are actually terrible.
@TheNthDoctor That is amazing and you are my hero.
@TheNthDoctor @PrinceOfBrains @rfarnsworth3 I would watch it with you both, but I live far away :(
@TheNthDoctor @PrinceOfBrains IT WAS TOTALLY YOU
@TheNthDoctor @PrinceOfBrains The John Cena girl is adorable and holy shit Randy Orton.
@TheNthDoctor @PrinceOfBrains Actually, a friend of ours had us both watch it earlier tonight!
"I have always depended upon the kindness of penis." #WeebClub
 @ChZuckBean @PrinceOfBrains @BillyDenton23 @SharkPrinceRen
@TheAngryFangirl I was in at "George Clinton."
I just want to watch wrestling forever.
@Five_Three At least two hundred.
@SharkPrinceRen Haha, you're welcome, my little kohai &lt;3
Creeper number three today. What the fuck. Is it a full moon?
@SeenPerfidy At least they finally did something. I'm sure that's a minor comfort, but still.
@GeekyLyndsay @NotFaulty I used to make excuses not to talk during raids on WoW and played a male toon to avoid that shit.
@NotFaulty @GeekyLyndsay I used to refrain from speaking on my headset to avoid "SHOW US YOUR TITS." I'd rather be booted.
@unintelligibl3 Nah, it was amazing. I had the micro because I have little hands, but it was so comfy.
*abyss pretends it's doing something on its phone*
I hate it when people ruin how nice I think they are by flirting with me.

4-year-old: Stay away from dragons.

Me:

Me: Well, obviously.
Boss: I have baby dolls!
Me: Are they creepy?
Boss: No, they're German!
Me: So, yes? 
#creepy 
@SharkPrinceRen WE SURE ARE &lt;3
Me: HOLY SHIT @BaileyJayTweets HAS A TWITTER
@SharkPrinceRen: THE BAILEY JAY?!
Me: Thx for knowing the same porn stars I do &gt;___&gt;

Last night I dreamt that @alyankovic was my neighbor and extolled the virtues of eating fresh apples to me to the tune of Albuquerque.
@cammi316 Thrall is a big boy, we can share ;p

One time I was drunk and fell off Thunder Bluff. #SomeWoWTweets

Thrall says lok'tar to me and I just melt. I missed him so much. #SomeWoWTweets
THRALL. MY WARCHIEF, MY LOVE. LET ME BE YOUR INSTRUMENT OF VENGEANCE. (This made goblin worth it.) #SomeWoWTweets
If I have to do one more goddamn vehicle quest, I'm done with having a goblin. Their whole starting zone is annoying af. #SomeWoWTweets
@gordonj2k Oh, I knew they were going to be Chinese. They could have at least gotten the pronunciations right.
@MadniZilla YUUUUUP
@gordonj2k Sad part? I went into making a goblin expecting Jewish stereotypes. I thought they had black people covered with orcs. -__-
Then again every WoW race is a racial stereotype so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. -__-
4) play football
5) run over some people and steal their shit
6) ROB A BANK
what the even fuck #SomeWoWTweets
1) beat some troll (Jamaican) slaves
2) buy some bling and drive a hot rod
3) booty dance, shaking it "like a goblinoid picture"
Am I the only one who thinks the goblin starting area in WoW is INCREDIBLY FUCKING RACIST HOLY SHIT?
"Come to the Valley of Honor, I have a gift for you."

I forgot how much of a TOTAL USELESS PRICK Garrosh Hellscream is. Guh, I hate that guy. Makes me embarrassed to be Horde.
I'm going back to playing WoW, where everyone sucks and nothing I do matters.
I'm having a panic attack and they didn't even have anything really bad to say. D:
I just got my judge reviews for Round 1 of the story contest and I'm not used to reading criticism.
@AndrewWK If I invite you, will you come? I have pizza! And beer!
@Starbucks Are your employees trained and paid for this? Because they deserve way more to talk to asshats about racial inequality.
@VernonShaw @BillyDenton23 And thank goodness.
And thank you @TheAngryFangirl for reminding me of this particular embarrassment. ;p
This was my favorite song as a kid. I, as a kid, did not grasp its subject matter. Ah, the horrors of childhood. 
Well, I'm done on the internet for the night. Thanks @colesprouse and @dylansprouse. &lt;3 
@BillyDenton23 I always forget there's a Five Guys like ten minutes from me.
Fuck it. I'm spending my afternoon applying for data entry jobs. If patience for repetitive tasks is a virtue, I may as well get paid.
@papierhache When you're cis and dress androgynously, you just get told that you're worthless because men won't want to fuck you.
LT I spent twenty minutes tracking down the episode name and script of the Friends episode the second half of that tweet is from.
After days of record editing, I've learned I'm ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.
Is it just me, or is having children's books series engineered and manufactured by a syndicate extremely creepy? 
Why does everyone want to talk to me extensively today? I'm not that fun to talk to. Is my blank-faced smile inviting?
Dude on the phone who just spent two minutes scolding me for speaking quickly, maybe you should try it sometime.
Yooo, all of this. 
@dosnostalgic I'm at work. I'll have to learn about Loom later. :(
@dosnostalgic So, um, can you tell me about Loom?
I should do a series of Babysitters Club horror rewrites.
Babysitters Club "Dawn and Whitney, Friends Forever": I BET WHITNEY COPIES DAWN THEN KILLS HER AND TAKES HER PLACE BUT KEEPS THE CORPSE
When I pick up "Dawn and the Older Boy", a Babysitters Club book, and immediate think I BET HE KILLS AND EATS HER! #toomuchhorror?
More songs need spacey sounds, like Dream Weaver or I Ran (So Far Away). I love songs with spacey sounds.
@TheMadWelshman I'll have to give it a listen when I'm home!
Also, I really need to get better at video editing, so I can do a video of River and Simon to White Wedding. #Firefly
@TheMadWelshman Not one of my favorite, personally, but I could see why you'd pick that one!
Hungry Like The Wolf is one of the sexiest songs ever written tbh
There are few things more annoying than having your ten minutes of snooze button interrupted.

I just stabbed myself in the cheek with a fork. From the outside. Quite on accident. It's that sort of day.
Me: You did include the volume numbers in the call number on those hundreds of Babysitter's Clubs, right?
Coworker: I didn't know...
