you have the power to lift people up and make people happy and you also have the power to do the opposite even if you think you don't.
random but... always remember there's a person on the other side of the screen/phone/conversation. they have feelings. your words matter.
when a show makes you cry 87 times and then you start getting emotional about everything that's ever happened in the world fml
"sooner or later in life, we will all take our own turn being in the position we once had someone else in." <THOUGHT BALLOON>
me: yay different viewpoints i'm good with that it's good that we're all different!!! 
me on political/social issues: 
ethan's like "is bernie sanders running for president???" and i'm in his mentions writing harry potter and the goblet of fire
@EthanShumJr OMG IM SO SORRY FOR ALL THE REPLIES SJTDJFM I GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS
@EthanShumJr go on some hateful diatribe but expect me to get it because it's really hard to unlearn how to be a bigot after you hit 50? FOH
@EthanShumJr any sense to me and i have had SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE be like oh it's nothing personal i just think that-- and then they
@EthanShumJr you can't deny rights for others in the name of your ideology or the constitution or on religious grounds and have that make
@EthanShumJr but if you come at me trying to tell me that you oppose rights for queer people for any reason i will shut you down immediately
@EthanShumJr on social issues i do not bend and there is a clear right and wrong and the paths to achieving the end result can be varied
@EthanShumJr ME ME ME. like honestly i'm unapologetically liberal. i can appreciate the /concept/ of different viewpoints ideologically BUT
@EthanShumJr my conservative relatives constantly spout off the he's a socialist line and i'm like... do you know... what a socialist... is?
@turnerrebecca I HAVE MANY OK AND ALSO ANGELS
@turnerrebecca MY DAD
@EthanShumJr major media outlet attention makes me so happy bc i'm more liberal on pretty much every issue than the party and shsfjjg bernie
@EthanShumJr like the party obviously has the candidate they want so it's kind of a no go period but just knowing that he'll receive more
@EthanShumJr YOU ARE ME JSSTJ i'm a polisci major and so in love w/ him honestly i watched his entire filibuster on cspan in real time

@granderance *one direction's story of my life plays*
@heeysunshinex congrats bb!! &lt;3
it's so inspiring to think that in this life, you can shift the conversation and change/shape peoples minds just by being who you are.
education is a process. we've all learned through visibility/questioning of what we have been taught and have learned over time.
this interview is going to spark conversations that may not have been started otherwise and that is so important. #BruceJennerInterview
@meangoth &lt;3
@meangoth 
@meangoth DO YOU NEED A STREAM BB
"dad said: it's not that i'm trying to dress up like a woman. its that i've spent my whole life dressing like a man." #BruceJennerInterview
"i tried to explain to them that as much of your upbringing was her as much as it was the he side. i'm not going anywhere." #BruceJennerABC
@runyonhanlon first real exposure to these issues and i believe that it will do so much good.
@runyonhanlon there are so many people who don't understand and haven't been exposed to education on these issues and this will be their
this interview is providing some much needed education on gender identity, gender expression, and orientation on such a large scale.
@missugleeklaine YESSSSSSS BAE WERK
@missugleeklaine NEVER LEAVE ME AGAIN
visibility/awareness changes lives. one person watching this and feeling understood/not alone in the world is a victory. #BruceJennerABC
@EthanShumJr 
it takes an abundance of courage and bravery to be who you are in the face of uncertainty that people will understand.
i'm so fucking proud. SO proud. #BruceJennerInterview
@runyonhanlon and if you're stressed and want/need to vent please feel free because i understand your woe ok i welcome caps ranting 24/7.
to all my loves experiencing finals stress this week or next, you are smart and wonderful and it's almost over and you'll be great. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

the first time i ever had feelings for another girl was when i was a teenager and it was weird because i had never even considered girls but

@LeenScene i HATE sports but i still love watching figure skating/gymnastics, like i'm incredibly throw things at the tv passionate about it

6) i watched degrassi religiously as a kid and ellie nash was literally my favorite person in the world bc i related to her so much

@runyonhanlon hand and it made me sad bc i'm very affectionate and didn't understand what the big deal was but i still love holding hands

@runyonhanlon there was also grass right underneath my window where i used to feed the birds so it was a soft landing!!
@runyonhanlon i lived on the first floor of my apt complex so this isnt as dangerous as it sounds
2) i jumped out of my window when i was a little kid and ran around hoboken nj without a care in the world and i can't remember.... why
@runyonhanlon being mean to me i grabbed one of the fake roses in her room and i threw it directly at her face she was so mad
1) i roleplayed sailor moon w/ a frenemy in middle school and she was sailor moon and i was tuxedo mask and to get back at her for always

@Louis_Tomlinson remember that time you were an egg can your record label logo be an egg so i can reminisce ty egg louis &lt;3
i try to see the good in people and hold onto any happy moments i can because it's so much easier to remember and relate to anger and pain.
@bbgurl4eva it's one of my fav quotes! you can tell a real smile vs a show of teeth and i love seeing people happy bc it makes me happy.
“they say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.”
@Zankiewerk ITS BECAUSE YOU PICKED A POWERPUFF GIRL (ok ITS NOT BUT I'M HAPPY FOR YOU &lt;3)

@johnnycolas chasing lights aka the best pop album released by a girl group in the past 10 years that wasn't a GA album/taller in more ways
@frankiescoven IS THIS ME
me in middle school: i love britney spears!!
kids: ew listen to *lists every band played on alt rock station*
me: ok great but i luv britney
my obsession with all of andrew mcmahon's musical forms and jimmy eat world knows no bounds

this is a little extreme but 
@Laurathingie THE TRINITY
@l0vemelikeud0 INSTANT STAR WOUNDED ME
@runyonhanlon alexz we need to talk
"tell me you'll love me like a star. tell me you'll want me wherever you are. tell me you'll breathe me until your last breath. liar, liar."
@sadiekitty OMG THAT IS ME IN ANIMAL FORM I HAVE COME TO SAY HELLOV
alexz johnson gave me so many songs to cry to growing up how will i ever repay her
my mood as told by the veronicas:
happy: 4ever
angry: mouth shut (like the majority of the time)
the fact that lindsay's if it's alright was never given the single treatment when it's one of my fav pop songs of the 2000s is a shame to me
@johnnycolas be good to me, headstrong, goin crazy, don't touch, masquerade, hot mess, tell me lies, crank it up, i'm back... SO MANY JAMS.
ashley tisdale also had some great pop songs on headstrong + guilty pleasure that deserved to be singles holy holy.
no matter how old i get i could honestly listen to ashlee simpson's debut record for the rest of my life, it was such a good pop album.
@johnnycolas IT WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT. i would love her to release her own call the shots type song, but i eat up any pure pop release tbh.
this album changed my life

@turnerrebecca THEY ALL MAKE SENSE TO ME WHEN YOU SAY IT
@gabyshade my wife my mom my life
us: can't wait for naeha to come back!!!
bbcan: TIME FOR A ~*TWIST*~ we are allowing all evicted hgs to return... as cardboard cutouts!!!!
bbcan ended when naeha was evicted
bbcan feeds were down for a million hours and we thought it was bc of the twist but even the feeds are like nah you know what i'm done
@klainezankie me too!! i'm very far left on both fiscal and social issues in a middle/hard right leaning country and it's so sashdiysutsurdi
@klainezankie nooooooo i'm sorry bb :( i know i'm gonna get in so many debates/arguments over the next year
sometimes i feel too liberal for my party and i just sit and stare at clouds and wonder when i will get the representation i deserve.
this is what happens when i leave my house on weekends rip. :( I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A LOVELY DAY.
and when ppl know you personally and say "no i don't mean YOU" like i'm special bc you collected a queer friend for your pokemon set.
i'm so tired of conservative dems balking and hesitating and running away from queer issues like we've got the plague. get out.
when you hear someone whisper "gay" like they're afraid of flying unicorns disrupting their marriage and you want to deactivate them irl.
