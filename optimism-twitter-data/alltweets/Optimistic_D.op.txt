Great to see Richard Thompson @TorpedoTT looking healthy and fast repping #TeamTT at the #IAAFWorldRelays
Overall lots of budding positives for Jamaica out of these Championships #IAAFWorldRelays
I think I saw a little spark from Samantha Henry-Robinson... hope my eyes didn't deceive #Hopeful #TeamJamaica  #IAAFWorldRelays
I see super curves in the future...  RT @davidrileyja As far as I am concerned @Julian_Forte is the WJC over 200m
@Leford_Green nope, young Fisher &amp; (Bailey-Cole) handled themselves well; much smoother exchanges by that team as well…
@davidrileyja indeed… The Kenyans sent teams for everything except the 4x100m, with effort we can do the same (excepting the 4x1500M)
I proclaim that the Golden Baton shall belong to #TeamJamaica one day… #IAAFWorldRelays #GreatEvent
"…Great second place, as expected, by Jamaica"  #IAAFWorldRelays #NeverTakeItForGranted
Let's not forget #TeamJamaica World Record in the Men 4x200M; based on the event we truly are the superpowers in (ie. 200M) #IAAFWorldRelays
Not as smooth as the Heats, but fantastic run nonetheless, so happy Young Forte got the opportunity to enjoy the victory  #IAAFWorldRelays
