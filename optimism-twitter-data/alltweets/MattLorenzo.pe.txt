Or more likely Cena wins lol.
What if Rusev goes to burn the American flag and that's how he gets Cena to quit?
@RameyRants One has 4 titles in the last 20 years and one has nothing. How does that even get published?
@RameyRants This might be the worst comparison of all time. 
Wow, can't believe it actually came back on in a timely manner.
And of course the tv went out at the hotel. Not like I was gonna watch Raw or anything.
Born to be Wild played on my shuffle and literally as he said "I like smoke and lightning" there was lightning. Crazy.
@BGross94 Gonna risk it? Prob wont sell out, but you never know.
@BGross94 Did you buy your PWS ticket yet?
@AlexLorenzoCT I'm buying the PWS tickets now just to be safe. You are gonna owe me 70.
@RameyRants Caps gave up a goal win 1 second left in the first and then one in the first minute of the 3rd. Who does that?
@RameyRants They aren't scoring 5 off The King.
@RameyRants Holtby is back to being unreliable I guess.
@RameyRants Yeah right.
@RameyRants And the Caps are done. Hate my life. Rangers will wash the floor with TB or Montreal.
@RameyRants And the millionaires club!
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Yeah. They were right about Hogan holding guys back if that did happen.
@RameyRants I also just read WCW lost 62 million bucks in 2000.
@RameyRants You know what I never knew? Vince only paid 2-3 million for WCW. Like how?
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT 
Never came back from 3-1 down in team history and now will do it 2 years in a row.
This is why the Rangers are gonna win in 7. Lundqvist is getting hotter then Holtby.
Officially on vacation. Lets go.
7:18 and the game still hasn't started. Shit is so annoying.
@RameyRants Yikes.
Yay Fox News! 
Can I not get a stuffed nose right before vacation please?
@RameyRants Wow I didn't even see that lol.
@RameyRants Although if they did, they'd probably give up 9.
@RameyRants They need to start scoring 10 runs a game.
@RameyRants I'm worried about the use of the pen. Yeah gotta get wins, but these guys can't do this all year, can they?
Yankees hang on thanks to the pen.
@RameyRants Depends lol. On my way to St. Louis. Oh games at 7. And I'm leaving on Monday so I'm an idiot.
@RameyRants I was actually watching. I'll probably be driving  during the game Sunday.
@RameyRants It can't just fucking end.
@RameyRants Fucking unbelievable.
Joe is gonna do to Betances and Miller what Torre did to poor Scott Proctor. @RameyRants
Joe, you can't keep using Betances and Miller THIS MUCH.
@RameyRants He looks like a giraffe.
@RameyRants Oh god here we go Viva La Vida.
@RameyRants I can't watch more then a minute or two at a time. I'm just waiting for Alex to yell when the Rangers score, then I'll know.
@RameyRants YOU JUST MADE MY NIGHT.
@RameyRants I'm surprised nobody has given in and signed him already.
@RameyRants Imagine that pen. Jesus. Too expensive though.
@RameyRants We need Warren to go back to the pen.
@RameyRants They are gonna die.
@RameyRants Those backstage segments always look so stupid.
@RameyRants What happened?
@RameyRants Monstrous BC sounds better.
@RameyRants Fucking Tyrus.
@RameyRants Hes 39. Looks awful.
@RameyRants Good lord Anderson got old.
@RameyRants Dear god.
That little shit almost interfered with that ball. Morons. Hope Jones is ok.
@Gregsies lol
@RameyRants I'm actually tempted to watch now that Taz is gone.
Were gonna need Warren in the pen when the other guys wear down!
I think Warren is better suited to be in the pen.
@RameyRants He good.
Looks like he got pushed.
Rangers came out guns blazing tonight though. Should be another good game.
The Caps badly need to get this done tonight. They do not want to give the Rangers any momentum.
@RameyRants Well at least Ellspenis is playing like we paid him. If only Beltran could fix himself.
Is there a better 1-2 in a lineup right now then Ellsbury and Gardner?
@RameyRants He hit 8 home runs in 8 games at one point in May.
@RameyRants Last time I remember someone this hot was Tino in 2005 when he hit like a million home runs.
@RameyRants Usually hes off by about 40 feet.
@RameyRants Yeah but it was actually accurate. With his arm, I'll take at least that.
Desperately hoping for a series clinching win tonight.
Nice throw Gardy!
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT @Nytemare10 Oh god.
@alohatrav @NickMcGlashanCC Be safe guys!
@AlexLorenzoCT Upload your video.
@alohatrav Not an arm chair crabber at all. If I were I'd have said he was an asshole and I could do his job. Which I certainly cannot.
@PDKimi That dude thinks you should learn how to read.
@NickMcGlashanCC Good response btw. I appreciate a sense of humor.
@NickMcGlashanCC Hahaha. I couldn't do the job even if you weren't being a dick =)
@RameyRants Did you see my snapchat?
The fact that A-Rod is 40 hits away from 3000 is mind blowing. Its so close!
If there was a biggest asshole award on Deadliest Catch, I think @NickMcGlashanCC would be in the running.
@RameyRants Should I put you down for two, Brendan?
@RameyRants Ugh. All I heard him say was goodbye.
@RameyRants That shit better not make the WWE get even softer. Its bs.
Oh come on @RealMichaelKay you can't tease us with there being one Center Stage you didn't like. Which one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RameyRants 
Honestly, if Floyd Mayweather dropped dead today, I don't think I'd give a shit. Hes a worthless piece of shit. 
@RameyRants I'm still worried though.
@RameyRants Yeah somehow the Caps are up 3-1
@RameyRants That shit is hilarious.
@RameyRants 
Watching old Raws from 1993 just remind me how brilliant Bobby Heenan was.
@GoldStandard000 I started from the beginning. They should all be on there already. So stupid that its not.
I hate watching Raw replays when they go back to showing highlights from a different show, but the network doesn't have that show.
@wwe @WWENetwork Add Wrestling Challeng, WWF Mania, WWF Superstars, Shotgun Sat Night, Sun Night Heat and all other tv shows please!
Who the fuck does wrestling moves on an 18 moth old child? Fucking IDIOT. 
Jericho is hosting Tough Enough with Booker T, Billy Gunn and Lita. Nice.
Still waiting for the @WWENetwork to add more TV show replays.
@RameyRants Did you know that Lex Luger used a piledriver as his finisher in WCW and called it the attitude adjustment?
@RameyRants Hes old so its kinda strange they would actually want to sign him. Gonna be interesting to see what they call him.
@RameyRants I assume Joe would go to NXT, but I think he could easily be on the main roster right away.
NHL relic and Panini Contenders rack packs.: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Itami hurt his shoulder and is out 6-8 months.
UGH Itami is out 6-8 months. That fucking sucks.
@AlexLorenzoCT Has a few things to unbox today!
James Harden is a douche bag. I bet hes still crying about not winning MVP.
@jeanette7ericks I do that lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT No you didn't. You said you don't know what time the game is.
@AlexLorenzoCT ?
@AlexLorenzoCT Did mom turn 60 yet? I can't remember.
@AlexLorenzoCT Oh were going out to dinner Sat.
@AlexLorenzoCT Mothers day/bday?
@AlexLorenzoCT For what?
It needs to be Monday.
These 2 are idiotic, but having to register as a sex offender for life and possible jail time is a tad much 
Tampa vs Washington would be awesome though.
@THEVinceRusso At least spell his fucking name right if your gonna trash him.
@CManettas Oh hey Jay.
Anyone who is a Rangers hater and think 3-1 means its over, please stfu. Until one team beats them 4 times in a series, I'm nervous.
Rangers came back from 3-1 down last year so it aint even close to over.
Caps still have a lot of work left to do. Nice win though.
And can a ref really tell the ushers that if a fan says something he gets thrown out? Really?
I had no idea Hedo Turkoglu was still in the NBA.
@JSamms7 Interesting.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT I hate the Rangers. Nothing hes breaking interests me. I miss Sterling.
@Seanfranchise6 Yeah 0.2. Ugh still hurts.
@Seanfranchise6 Same with the Caps in game 1. Devils was .02 I believe.
@JSamms7 What are the cards?
I turned the Tampa game off bc it was under a minute. Wow.
I guess Kay just answered that lol.
How have we not torched Buehrle yet?
@RameyRants I may cry.
@ANWild119 Nice. I have the Trish and Austin.
@RameyRants This needs to be false 
God please don't let Sami Zayn's injury be a torn rotator cuff. 
@RameyRants And I saw the Macho Mandow thing, its amazing. The Mega Powers 2.0?
@RameyRants I like Harper as a singles wrestler tho.
@RameyRants I saw that Rowan was working as a heel. After just being gone for months.
@RameyRants HAHAHA BME.
@RameyRants That was a pathetic win.
Yankees should be in this spot right now, but its annoying when Bautista clearly swung.
Well this is getting hard to watch.
Are you kidding me? That is a swing.
@RameyRants Miller and Betances will be dead by July.
The back end of the bullpen is gonna be dead by the all star break.
Speaking of Carpenter, When is @J2thecarpenter gonna get my fan mail I sent to her agency?
Jesus christ Carpenter. Its 3 outs.
This 100 pitches thing is bullshit. I guarantee Pineda coulda gone out for the 9th. Or just let this fucker finish the 9th. Dont get sum1 up
The fact that we have to get Miller up is pathetic.
I eat green berets for breakfast. And right now I'M VERY HUNGRY. 
@RameyRants God hearing him say some of his classic lines again is amazing.
@RameyRants Dear god that is amazing.
@RameyRants Well lets hope our hitting keeps his up all year.
@BenNordstrom We should do stupid shit like this for my youtube channel 
@RameyRants I read Cena was aware of it. When he dropped him you can see him say my shoulder so that probably made it worse.
@RameyRants How the fuck does anyone even do that? You'd have to really be fucking trying to pump them up.
I thought he said that was a balk. That's weird that even tho he calls balk, if the pitch is still thrown, its live.
Jacoby is fucking on fire.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy I had a dream about you the other night. It was strange and kinda X rated. Stay out of my head!
@amurillo91 @amurillo91 Even if that is the case, I'll still take it. Hes at least in the main event.
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT I'd go solely to hang out with Gatsby.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I'll tell Christian were getting GA.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Its Supercard, but I don't think it'll sell out anytime soon. So if you can get them within a week or 2.
Also it just dawned on me, what if they added Ambrose to that match just so Rollins can win without pinning Reigns or Orton?
I'm watching 1993 Raw on the network and they always show clips from WWF Superstars, yet they don't have Superstars from back then on there!
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Can you buy them Alex? I'd rather do GA too.
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT Its only like 20-25 depending on which day.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Lawler was also the AWA Southern Heavyweight Champion 35 fucking times.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Look at these title reigns. Lawler was a 28 time champion. 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I think GA is fine. Alex you owe me 40 bucks for NEW so if you wanna get both our tix.
@AlexLorenzoCT I posted this on Jacob's wall. Wonder if @CManettas is going 
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT We need to get tix for PWS soon. Either 45 for 2nd or just do 30 for GA.
@RameyRants Some people think Sami hurt his shoulder pumping the crowd up before the match.
Anyone that buys Selfies by Kim needs their head examined.
That Rollins Bieber picture is hilarious.
I prefer Raw with Kane in charge and not HHH and Steph.
Still can't get past the mohawk.
Long live King Mabel?
Barret's bulge is way too obvious.
Tamina's awful hair even looks better lol. Good to see her back from injury at least.
Namoi looks UGLY with braids.
Most guys don't look that good when they win their debut match. That was awesome.
2 absolutely phenomenal matches on tonight's Raw.
But seriously how do you have Cena be knocked out on the floor then literally jump up and give the AA?
Wow they are really making Zayn look good. A rookie kicking out of the AA?
Even if you hate Cena, his US title open challenges have all been great matches.
You could hear Sami yell my shoulder!
@RameyRants Hahaha.
I remember when he fought Leo Kruger at WM 29 axxess, I think one of his first matches and it got stopped cuz he was bleeding.
Legit injury. God poor @iLikeSamiZayn
Owens should come out and cost him the match.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN BROADCAST THE START OF MATCH
Too fucking bad WWE went to god damn commercial. That crowd is probably still going fucking nuts.
Sucks hes gonna lose, but still this is awesome.
I cannot believe they actually did this. Zayn has a match at the next NXT live show so I figured there was 0 chance. This is awesome.
MARKING THE FUCK OUT RIGHT NOW.
NO. FUCKING. WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SAMI ZAYN!
No fucking way..........
Slater is hilarious.
Why did I let myself get excited for Sami Zayn when we all knew there was 0 chance.
Is he there to beat Booker T up?
Fuck yeah Bret Hart!
Hurry up and bring out who he is facing.
They would never use an NXT guy for just 1 match, even if its in his home.
And I wonder if that clip of Cena just saying I quit will be used to have Rusev win. Or if Cena will just win and keep the belt.
Damn I wish it would be Sami Zayn to accept Cena's challenge.
This is hilarious 
Spiders in the bag?
The only name you need to know for tough enough is @ThrillrideCW
Who is the dumbass chick who filmed her tough enough thing vertically?
It will be nice though when Lana can drop that accent.
How can you chant we want Lana when she is already out there?
@Seanfranchise6 @RameyRants Sounds like a boatrace.
Lana and Paige need to be single. I can't handle both my Divas being taken lol.
@RameyRants People are so fucking dumb.
@Seanfranchise6 @RameyRants Musta been hella heated.
Ugh please keep Ambrose in the main event.
@RameyRants What the fuck was he mad about?
@RameyRants Didn't hear anything.
@DanielleSully19 As long as Ambrose stays in the match!
I think the Authority will change the match back next week. Can Ambrose just win MITB please?
@RameyRants That's what I'm thinking
@Brittin95 I wish he would win either way.
I'm not getting excited until Raw ends and Ambrose is still int he main event. Hell I wont even until the match actually happens.
Can they please not say J&amp;J was banned so the result doesn't count?
I just marked the fuck out and jumped up and down when Ambrose won, but stopped bc they'll change it I know it.
@RameyRants I thought the same thing.
At least Ambrose finally beat Rollins.
No way they keep him in the main event.
AMBROS WON????????????? WHAT??????????????
That was an unreal play by Headley.
DAMMIT JONES.
Damn when there are 2 things on I wanna watch I sometimes forget about one of them and say on the other too long. Missed half this match.
@RameyRants That is a true man. And still almost won.
@RameyRants You can't pitch these 2 guys this much. He should have just let someone else pitch the 8th.
@RameyRants Why the fuck did Gardner slow down?
How does Gardner slow up there?
OK at this rate Betances and Miller won't have arms to pitch with by September. 5 out save? Really?
@davo_77 Hahaha.
@RameyRants Is Joe fucking nuts?
@RameyRants That is a special kind of stupid.
ESPN "top events" has basketball then baseball. Totally not caring about hockey.
Damn Chris Paul is out tonight. That hurts.
@RameyRants I forget was the restaurant guy homeless too? Or just an idiot?
@RameyRants Not sure which part was crazier, the trying to cash that check or his restaurant idea.
Its never gonna happen. Why do they even have to tease us like that?
Who's dick do I gotta suck to have Ambrose added to the main event?
@RameyRants Faggot go read it!
@RameyRants Did you read the article bout the check cashing guy?
Man Ambrose vs Rollins was one of my fav feuds in recent memory
@RameyRants Wasn't he good before?
@RameyRants I don't think he was.
@RameyRants Especially against an offense like the Jays.
@RameyRants Remember when The Ascension didn't suck?
For as well as the WWE  has done with Neville on the main roster, the exact opposite can be said for The Ascension.
@RameyRants Miller wasn't good yesterday and still didn't give up a run.
@RameyRants Eventually.
@RameyRants We gotta win now.
And the tie is broken. #Yankees
@RameyRants Its about time he did. His line about if he ignores them they'll keep doing it was brilliant
Rollins is the biggest tool champion in a long long time. Do they have to do it that way?
@RameyRants Its been 6 innings already?
Orton must have hated that he had to job to Kofi.
Kofi "don't talk about my chest" Kingston.
See this City Mobile commercial all the time and can't figure out who plays the mom. 
Worst Raw open in history?
The only good thing about New Day is Woods asking what did we do when people say they suck. That is funny.
Really hope that Steph doesn't come back this week. Or any week.
New Day is in the opening segment of Raw. Interrupting Orton and Reigns. Not sure which part of that is stranger.
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
#Yankees are really starting to get my hopes up. I hope they can be good all year and we can enjoy their ride to a possible playoff spot.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants 
@MichelleDBeadle I love you and the WWE. Totally agree with you. Never liked Mayweather, hes a piece of shit.
@GoldStandard000 @Nytemare10 @AlexLorenzoCT @itsmiguelyo @WeThePiwko I need the price first. Maybe I can afford it myself.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants 
@GoldStandard000 @Nytemare10 @AlexLorenzoCT @itsmiguelyo @WeThePiwko Just sent that same thing lol. Now that is a hobby box.
@GoldStandard000 @Nytemare10 @AlexLorenzoCT 2015 Topps WWE Undisputed Box Break 3 Autographed Relics 7 Autographs 10 Parallels 50 Total
@Nytemare10 @GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT @itsmiguelyo @WeThePiwko Finally WWE booooklets!
@Nytemare10 @GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT @itsmiguelyo @WeThePiwko That shit is high end. Looks awesome.
Kinda excited for John Wick 2.
And does this mean we can please hire Dan Bylsma to be our coach? Obviously Mike Babcock isn't realistic. Bylsma would be great.
The Devils named Ray Shero GM? Um why? Does Lou not want to be GM anymore?
2015 Sage Hit NFL rookie cards box break #1. Four autographs per box.: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I'll try next time I see him. Hes not cool like that though lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Both wear glasses and have beards. If you just met us for the first time you might think we were the same.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants No another kid named Matt who looks way too much like me.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I listened to the first part of Jericho and Ambrose and the first part of Austin and Vince Russo.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I only do when the other guy at work who likes wrestling plays them.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Sheamus said on Jericho's podcast that he used to work in "IT" in Dublin fixing shit lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT No way.
@AlexLorenzoCT You never should look at your daddy's penis when hes walking down the hall on Sunday morn.
@AlexLorenzoCT It was Sunday morn....come on.
@AlexLorenzoCT You know what I made sure I didn't look at yesterday on Sunday morn?
Miller can't be perfect all year, but those 30 pitch innings are killer.
Well we earned that sweep. #Yankees
This fucking game is starting to piss me off.
WTF ARE THE YANKEES DOING??????????????
Yeah Hanley with 2 outs and a guy on, he was trying to hit you. I hate stupid people.
Good god the Red Sox are a bunch of fucking morons.
That is one of the worst goals against you'll see.
What in the hell was that Crawford?
Shut the fuck up Hanley. Dipshit.
I also love how Pacquiao was denied an injection for his injured shoulder. The fuck?
@RameyRants 
Anyone know anything about the scoring last night? 
I left the room with Tex up and 2 outs and now were up 2-0. You're welcome.
I like James Taylor, but that song is fucking stupid. Sox do plenty of spending too asshole.
@RameyRants Woooow
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I heard Bryan on Jericho say up until the day of his mitb win Wade was supposed to win.
@AndrewPfefferle Its smoke and lightning lol
@RameyRants All he ever does is play defense.
Odds they have a rematch regardless of the outcome? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@RameyRants I can't wait to be extremely pissed off when I read your text in the middle of the night.
@RameyRants Mayweather is gonna win for one simple reason. There is no god. If there was, he'd get the shit kicked out of him.
@RameyRants You think for a mega fucking fight they would make sure nothing went wrong.
@MitchStringer16 No lol. I bet none of them are.
@MitchStringer16 Thanks.
@RameyRants How are you watching it?
@RameyRants What if the fight sucks?
Does anyone have a working stream that doesn't suck? Otherwise I'm gonna go to bed lol.
I never understood that. People have a huge following and then have a 2nd account for more videos. Why not just use the 1 channel?
What's the reasoning for people getting a second youtube channel? Is there any purpose?
I have 8 days before vacation.  EIGHT DAYS! Only 5 of them are work days. Hurry up!
@brookeeelynnn27 Stop being so damn cute. I can't handle that much cuteness on my facebook page! =P
This is why Pac Man needs to win 
@AlexLorenzoCT Howard Finkel was there.
I have to work tomorrow and god knows the fight will end up going on real late. Probably wont even bother staying up.
@RameyRants I'm probably gonna fall asleep before the fight. Text me who wins or if someone is dominating.
No fucking way I'm paying 100 bucks for this fight thats 5 years too late. Hopefully there is a decent stream. Go Pac.
Floyd Mayweather is a piece of shit and I hope he gets the fuck beat out of him.
@RameyRants I can't tell u how bad I want pac to win. 5 years ago I thought he would no doubt. Now I have no clue.
@RameyRants Um why?
@AndrewPfefferle Faggot your page is private. I can't retweet.
@RameyRants Now 6!
@MikeyTheAwes0me Thought I might have it saved with my music, but I don't.
@MikeyTheAwes0me No sadly.
@RameyRants How is that even possible?
@RameyRants Wait what???????
Are the fucking Blackhawks kidding me? You assholes blew a 3-0 lead? Fuck the Wild
@RameyRants Were gonna go to opening night. Now that you live closer.
@RameyRants And both named Joe lol. Damn, but is Tex fine?
@RameyRants You need to figure out how to get MSG+ for next season.
@RameyRants Fuck yeah it is.
@RameyRants I can't even name the running backs on Dallas' roster.
@RameyRants Giants drafted well too.
@RameyRants Nice win.
#Yankees win. Miller is fucking FILTHY.
@RameyRants Thank god for Bobby V fixing Miller.
@RameyRants That's on you.
o wam a bae o digi zooah. Jesus Christ that name!
They need to talk about Owamagbe Odighizuwa so we can all hear how to say that fucking name.
@WeThePiwko @AlexLorenzoCT Hahaha.
Giants addressed 3/4 needs. OL, S and DE.
@AlexLorenzoCT I wanna see @WeThePiwko pronounce Owamagbe Odighizuwa.
What the fuck is an Owamagbe Odighizuwa?
@RameyRants Jesus.
@RameyRants No.
Lets fucking go. 3 more outs.
@RameyRants Fuck yes!
@RameyRants And I bet you A-Rod doesn't even really care. Yeah its a lot of money, but hes prob like, lets just move on already.
@RameyRants I bet they lose any hearing on it. Its in his contract, they'll have to pay.
The Yankees are a fucking joke. Pay A-Rod you fucking idiots. Don't make this into a big deal you greedy fucks.
@RameyRants Yankees said they wont pay him.
@RameyRants Of course I missed it.
And of course I missed A-Rod's home run.
@MikeyTheAwes0me Find the Edgar Allen Poe video.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Sox catcher got the worst of it hopefully.
Yankees its time to get yo shit together.
@MikeyTheAwes0me @KanyeDoingStuff lol wtf?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Are you retarded? Most pay leagues are more. 50 bucks is cheap.
@AlexLorenzoCT When do you to back to school after summer? Hec and I are gonna do a football league for money.
@AndrewPfefferle Hey Andy 1 table.
@AlexLorenzoCT Wtf ever happened to Sam getting more Sterling?
@MikeyTheAwes0me @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Dammit. Youtube cut the audio.
@AlexLorenzoCT Probably heard Kiper rip him a new asshole.
Fucking @attell is hilarious.
@MikeyTheAwes0me @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants 
@MikeyTheAwes0me @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Mikey OUTTA NOWHERE. Mikey do you still have your dream within a dream video saved anywhere?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Fuck Dallas.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Sasha Banks is cousins with Snoop Dogg. Never knew that.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Who?
@Brittin95 @AlexLorenzoCT Best part of that video!
That is almost as bad as the one the Devils gave up against Carolina years back.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT DID THAT JUST HAPPEN????????????????????????
@RameyRants ITS FUCKING 100 BUCKS????????????????
Of course the Caps blew it.
@RameyRants I mean its not like I'd have to pay for it, but even spending my parents money on it idk. What is it 50? 60?
@RameyRants Always wondered what places like that had to pay for fights.
@AlexLorenzoCT Giants wont be good in Sterling 2015.
@RameyRants Aaaaaaand its gone.
Stupid piece of shit Redskins got the guy I wanted.
Well at least they took the OT, too bad they over drafted for him as Kiper just said.
Giants are gonna take a fucking RB aren't they?
@RameyRants Are these his draft chronicles? Get it?
Giants coulda used that OT.
Someone tell me who the black guy is on the draft panel? Lewis?
@RameyRants They haven't said his name again! I have no clue who he is.
@RameyRants Who is the black guy at the draft?
Get to the Giants already.
@RameyRants Fucking NBA.
@RameyRants He said Mariota wrong. Like how?
@AlexLorenzoCT Hes a pussy who doesn't want to actually compete for a spot. Obv thinks he couldn't beat out a rookie.
How do you mispronounce Mariota? Fucking idiot Goodell.
@RameyRants I don't understand anything anymore.
@AlexLorenzoCT Ur boy Zach Mett is a fucking pussy. Says he wants to be traded if they draft Mariota. Pussy.
@RameyRants Fuck the Eagles and Bears.
@RameyRants Hahahaha.
@RameyRants That must have been so awkward for everyone.
@RameyRants I know. I lol'd.
Lets go Caps...Ugh who am I kidding.
@davo_77 Congrats on the newest wrestling fan in your family!
Can't believe its already NFL draft day. Time flies.
WWE shop unboxing part 1.: 
Is there an official facebook fan page for @itsBayleyWWE? Either there isn't or I am inept at finding things. #hugme
@BretHart Booker T def didnt mean anything other then Owen wasn't as much of a high flyer. Poor choice of words, but no need to bury Neville
@RameyRants I fucking hate the NHL playoffs now though.
@RameyRants Do they? Spurs and Griz have the same record.
@Brittin95 I know. That face!
Why do the Griz face the Warriors? What if the Spurs win and they are the lower seed?
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 We could do that and sit wherever.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 GA is anything not in the first 2 rows.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT We gotta figure out what we wanna do.
WWE Ringside unboxing. Complete with camera botch.: 
I bet the Wings win.
I forgot that tool @jimmyfallon blocked me. Someone tell him he sucks for me.
Normally I agree with everything @ConanOBrien says and does, but @dubouchet was right. #JimmyFallonSucks
@RameyRants Or ruin it.
@RameyRants Don't get too carried away yet.
Yankees win again. Keep it up boys.
@RameyRants 6th starter and 3rd closer and we still win.
@RameyRants Yeah really.
@RameyRants Miller not available?
Someone tell @Maffewgregg from Botchamania to go back to the HBK/Undertaker everybody talks too much please.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me I'm so sad. Mikey do you still have that on your computer by any chance?
@AlexLorenzoCT Fucking @MikeyTheAwes0me's dream within a dream video got muted bc of the song! I don't know if I still have the audio clip.
@RameyRants I've missed like the last few seasons of FG. Just watched some of season 12 yesterday. Kinda miss it.
@RameyRants That's an old ass Family Guy reference.
@RameyRants Damn you Tommy Tutone.
@RameyRants 89 99 69 57 83.
@RameyRants Feels like it.
@RameyRants Its kinda amazing BNB is already a 5 time IC champ.
Neville wins bc he got to the finals and looked great. Win/win.
@RameyRants Finally they do something right.
No please fucking push Barrett.
YES BNB!
@RameyRants And great. At least Chase is pitching well.
@RameyRants Been more interviews then matches.
I want BNB to win and get pushed.
@RameyRants So his elbow and wrist are fucked?
Bye bye Tanaka.
@RameyRants Jesus fucking Christ.
@RameyRants Just what we need.
@RameyRants Um what
Oh DAMN. Sheamus got busted.
@RameyRants Obv he didn't mean to make fun of him dying, but still so stupid.
@RameyRants They compared Neville to Owen Hart and Booker said "But Owen couldn't defy gravity" Like he wasn't a high flyer.
@RameyRants Did you hear what Booker said about Owen Hart last night? I totally missed it yesterday.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT The last few PWS shows we went to weren't even good either.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Still 45. That's absurd.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Nice to see @ProWreSyndicate raising its prices bc its getting more popular.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT FUCKING PWS FRONT ROW IS 60 BUCKS.
Of course it only works on my computer.
There we go its working now. #KOTR
Anyone else not able to watch the King of the Ring?
And of course there is a problem with the KOTR video.
@RameyRants I was hoping lol.
@RameyRants I would come to Danbury to watch it, but that is 6 fights that are literally worthless lol.
@RameyRants Or we can go to hooters again and get those tater tots
@RameyRants UGH. There are 6 fights before it. Can you get there early and sit through all of it before I get there?
@RameyRants I want to watch it, but don't wanna pay for it. Are you gonna watch it?
WOW. You think the Yankees could coordinate Tanaka bobble head night with his actual start.
@RameyRants Is there a place near you that is showing the May-Pac fight?
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT I told Christian.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Wooo!
The only person that needs to be on tought enough is @ThrillrideCW. The rest of these dinks aren't needed.
Have to root for the Caps AGAIN against the Rangers. AND IT NEVER WORKS OUT. EVER.
@RameyRants I hope he keeps saying You're Welcome.
@andreap424 Wow you're a tool.
Axel and Sandow. 2 guys who got themselves over.
I fucking love Sandow.
Like what are the odds Neville wins it?
I was def gonna watch tomorrow if Ambrose was in it, now I might not even bother.
@RameyRants I swear to god if Truth wins KOTR. Let BNB win and actually get something going with it.
Wouldn't be surprised if the Caps don't even get a win against the Rangers.
Sheamus is the only one who is getting a push. BNB wont do anything with it. What a fucking joke Ambrose lost.
So the King of the Ring is literally worthless now that Ambrose and Ziggler are out.
Naomi's gimmick is turrible.
@SousLeRadar Hes the last goalie I'd want for a playoff series.
Holtby is fucking terrible.
Bring back Leo Kruger.
Wow you know its a slow night on Raw when Rosa gets mic time.
Fucking wasting Cody so badly.
@Gregsies That is true.
I love Stardust's theme!
If Truth wins this match, I riot.
@RameyRants Not only is Beltran not hitting,  he can't think either. Who runs on a 3-2 pitch with nobody at first?
Geez Beltran is an idiot.
We want Lana...To dump Rusev.
Lana is gonna turn face and renounce Russia.
Wonder how long Cena will keep it if he doesn't lose.
Cena isn't quitting, we know that. Maybe they'll do the Mankind thing and have a recording and Cena will lose.
Kidd and Cesaro should have been champs for a year.
Woods is actually the one I hate the least. Kofi and Big E are fucking tools in this gimmick.
Maybe Sheamus will screw Ziggler and then Ziggler will screw Sheamus and Ambrose can win?
Dear god let it not be Reigns.
Ziggler doesn't seem to ever get what he deserves so I'm gonna go with Ambrose. Who will of course end up getting knocked out right away.
Having Sheamus win it again makes no sense.
@RameyRants Chien-Ming Pineda?
King Ambrose sounds nice. Can he please win and then get pushed again?
@RameyRants Even worse is AL pitchers having to do it randomly.
Pretty much rooting for the Islanders bc the Caps have 0 chance of beating the Rangers. At least the Islanders will have a shot.
@RameyRants Nobody needs to see an 8 man lineup with an automatic out.
@RameyRants And that wont happen bc you wouldn't want your pitching prospects hurt hitting either.
@RameyRants Poor guy.
Scherzer is 100% right. Pitchers should not be hitting anymore. I'd be livid if my ace got hurt hitting.
@RameyRants DB and Miller is a fucking sick combo.
@RameyRants Wait, Betances sucked at the start of the season, but he never gave up a run. Wow.
Fucking Ambrose gets Sheamus in the first round? Those are the only 2 guys I could really see winning. I doubt Ziggler would win.
@RameyRants I would bet money hes gonna say that.
Kevin Spacey's voice on House of Cards is so annoying.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Every time someone cashes in, they do another on the spot rumble match. Too much.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Maff cashed in before a chairs match between Bahh and Bokara and Bokara won lol.
I swear the WWE just likes to fuck with everyone and do shit that makes no sense lol.
Some things never change. Yankees win the series 2-1.
THE RKO WAS BANNED, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
They made Rollins one of the weakest champions ever.
@RameyRants Remember when the WWE wasn't 100% pussies and the punt was legal?
Man I miss the punt.
Yankees need to hang on and win this.
I get the feeling that the door will be closed on Orton's head at some point.
Its gonna be annoying to have to pull out that pin every time to open the door.
Well this match has no suspense, obviously Rollins wins, but I'm sure it'll be a good match.
@WoollenMovie413 Bwhahahaha.
What part of NEVER GIVE UP didn't he get?
LOL WHY WOULD RUSEV WANT AN I QUIT MATCH WITH CENA?
@RameyRants So annoying.
@RameyRants I forgot my feed was like 30 seconds behind.
@RameyRants But they still need to kill time. Unreal.
@RameyRants At least there was no Authority promo!
Tough Enough needs @ThrillrideCW pay attention @TripleH
Roman Reigns has arrived? The fuck?
I think Cole is an idiot and listened to the crowd chant and not the ref. He said Roman won about 2 seconds too early.
@RameyRants Aaaaaaand its gone.
Finally the Spanish announce table gets destroyed!
@RameyRants The cage match?
That spot used to be cool.
@AlexLorenzoCT Montreal is usually the most expensive.
What the fuck happened to using the Spanish announce table?
You know I really hate someone when I root for Nikki Bella. Bitch Naomi shouldn't have blocked me for complimenting her ass!
@RameyRants They are kinda cool though, but she sucks.
@sunshinegirl19 @RameyRants Aww aren't you just the cutest lol.
@RameyRants Hopefully dying soon? Geez that's terrible.
@NYRPrincess True dat!
Naomi's new theme is terrible and so is she.
Making the Bellas faces is stupid. ITS 2015 WE DON'T NEED 1 HEEL AND 1 FACE. ITS OK FOR 2 HEELS TO FIGHT.
@NYRPrincess So one vote for not stupid? lol
@RameyRants Its like they don't care anymore.
I'd want it smaller then the Devils logo I have and on the wrist.
I'm seriously considering getting the old late 80s early 90s WWF logo tattooed. Honest opinions needed.
@RameyRants Tell Cait Kovalchuk mailed that chain to Rusev.
@NYRPrincess Yeah idk.
@RameyRants I JUST SAID THAT. GET OUT OF MY HEAD AND RIGHT?
@RameyRants Oh. My. God. @sunshinegirl19
Shouldn't the lights have reset after that AA?
What the hell is she gonna do without this character? Its not like she can wrestle. Unless she trains and then becomes unrussian lol
Rusev will be nothing without Lana.
@RameyRants Geez.
Ambrose won his first ppv match. Unreal it took that long.
@RameyRants I SAID NON IRON MAN MATCH
Has Ambrose still not won a ppv match since the Shield broke up?
Longest non iron man match ever?
Technically this might be one of the longest matches in history.
Haha yes they actually did something cool. Ambrose and Harper are back.
@RameyRants It'll be someone like Wyatt. Other then him, who else would win?
This better fucking mean Cesaro gets a huge singles push. Otherwise this is the stupidest fucking thing.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WWE????????????????????????????????????
@RameyRants A-Rod got another rbi btw.
@RameyRants Haha I thought Chris went well with that scolding tone tweet.
@RameyRants Did they say who's in it? I think King Cesaro has a nice ring to it.
@RameyRants I don't need to look at the network tweets Chris, I have you.
@RameyRants Wow its live?
@RameyRants That's kinda cool. I'm sure whoever wins won't get anything from it, but hey!
@RameyRants Please explain lol.
Hey Vince, did Cesaro (and Kidd) grab the brass ring? Bc they got over by BEING AWESOME.
@RameyRants Whats the deal with King of the Ring?
Is the King of the Ring gonna be on Raw and SD only? Or like the finals on the next ppv or something?
Wait what? King of the Ring is back?
@RameyRants They are gonna have to pay him.
I love how he can just not do it lol. What was the point of the match then?
Sheamus needs to yell are you not sports entertained instead.
Is Sheamus gonna kick him then kiss his unconscious ass?
@RameyRants When do they have to start paying the bonus money?
Well this is a way to kill a lot of time.
I hope these bs rumors of Dolph wanting to leave are just that, bs.
@AlexLorenzoCT We should go to that Mets game.
This match IS SO STUPID. Kiss my arse? Really????????????????
Can Ambrose and Harper randomly come back to the ring later?
I don't see the point of having Kane and Rollins hate each other. Are you really gonna turn Kane?
@RameyRants Yanks already losing.
Woooooooooooooooooooow so the match is just gonna end?
I hate Chicago. #FindANewChant
I wish street fights would be wrestled mostly on the outside of the ring and maybe actually IN A STREET. This one is finally backstage.
Someone in the arena tell that fucking moron to stop flashing that light.
God they just completely waste Barrett.
Barrett should not job.
@RameyRants Only the WWE would run that promo in the middle of a match.
WWE fucking runs a long ass promo in the middle of this match. Idiots.
Love JBL making fun of how they botched that shit during the UK tour.
@RameyRants Already forgot about that match lol.
@Rozz33 Thanks!
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Don't forget we have NEW on May 23rd.
@AlexLorenzoCT The 10th or 11th.
@RameyRants I can't watch pre shows. Trying to analyze something that is fake pisses me off.
@RameyRants Faggots.
Gonna be some good unboxings coming up soon.
After going the last few months not spending stupid money on shit I didn't need I caved and bought a shit ton on ringside and WWE shop lol.
@RameyRants So what were we supposed to do if it doesn't work in case mine doesn't?
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT Aww yeahuh!
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT Yeah man. But seriously congrats on Prov.
@AlexLorenzoCT 
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT I could have given you a lot of head.
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT No faggot you didn't choose FU!
@RameyRants He seems stupid enough.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants He'll never watch.
@RameyRants Jon Jones is fucked.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT I'll rip out your asshole if you don't sub, but I'm pretty sure you do.
@RameyRants The fuck is the deal about Ziggler teasing leaving?
@RameyRants Wtf I didn't get that alert. Assholes.
@RameyRants I knew they were gonna put him against Neville. Good match.
@AlexLorenzoCT 100 more to go!
@RameyRants Jesus really? Is Bryan officially out?
@RameyRants If my ace got hurt fucking hitting or base running (see Wang) I'd be livid.
@RameyRants Pitchers hitting is outdated and should go away.
Still cannot figure out why they never released one for Taker at 29 and YES it still pisses me the fuck off.
Man the WWE has sucked asshole ever since 29 with the Mania plaques. The ones they have out now don't even have autographs.
#AnyoneButTheRangers
And the Preds bite the dust.
Damn Flames are blowing their chance.
@RameyRants Oh what the fuck.
@RameyRants Its the opposite of last year?
@JSamms7 Nah it can't be fixed.
Yankees are at 4:05. Fuck yes I can watch.
@MrGriffinB I turned heel.
@MrGriffinB Yeah they have as much chance as the Raptors do of winning.
Ha Noah Syndergaard blocked me. What a tool.
Lets go Blues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @BenNordstrom
Great win for the Yankees. Pineda looked fucking amazing.
You don't have to allow crazy beards, but fucking let guys have a goatee.
The Yankee beard rule needs to go away. So fucking stupid.
Come on Pineda #Yankees
@MikeyTheAwes0me I've never heard anybody say, 'I'm going to Cleveland on vacation".
Also calling a 9-5 job pathetic. @Noahsyndergaard  we can't all play a fucking sport for a living. Be grateful.
So was  @Noahsyndergaard searching for himself when he went off on that troll? Bc he didn't @ him. #tool
And unless this is the year the Caps finally beat the Rags (which I doubt), then go Islanders.
Fucking Montreal needs to end this series now. Quit fucking around.
That was fucking virtually the same home run.
Well hey there Tex!!!!!!!!!!
If only Tex could go back to being that .280-.300 hitter.
Fuck yeah Tex!
RH &gt; CB.
Duda looks kinda like McCann.
Lets hope the Yankees keep playing well tonight!
@Gregsies Now hes got more time for that!
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 You could buy a Superticket and meet everyone for 200.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Ah fuck GA is sold out. My bad.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Sat June 6th.
I legit want to buy this and set it up in my room 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Pretty obvious you aren't saving much. We still need SummerSlam tickets!
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Good thing Legends sucks cuz its not like you'll have any money. And fucking Page is 20. She should be 15.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Ramey, tickets are running low if you are thinking about coming. We go to PWS too that night.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 As someone who wastes a lot of money, I'm amazed by the amount you spend on fucking cards.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 lol
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Know your going back out? As in know your going back out that month?
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Probably the only person I'm remotely excited to see bc shes never been there at least.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT "Today's April 8th" in a video uploaded on April 24th. Way to get that uploaded fast.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 They aint saggy!
Big Hits! Topps Chrome box 16-21 (and value packs) Contenders box 7-8 Fire box 1 and Platinum box 3: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Unless shes some absurd Legends price.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Shes hot. Maybe I'll meet her.
@RameyRants Well said.
Daredevil SPOILERS
In 1 season they revealed a secret and killed 2 of its best characters. I hope this doesn't mean it jumped the shark
And poor Shea Weber with a possible torn ACL. I didn't think the Preds would win with him, let alone without him.
Only thing that could get me to stop watching Daredevil is the playoffs.
@RameyRants 
This is Triple H trying to make himself feel better about burying people. 
@AlexLorenzoCT Tempting.
@gabriellenadine Yeah your bff.
Even if we lose today splitting with thr Tigers is good. Would be nice to take 3 though.
I hate weekday day games.
@RameyRants I can't believe we have held them to 4.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Not really.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants 
@mytweethurts That has a nice ring to it!
@mytweethurts Alright! If we add a few people to the 4 Horsemen do we become the Nexus?
@mytweethurts This was my favorite show since Tag Wars. Can't wait for May 23rd. Day before my and Brian Anthony's birthday!
@mytweethurts True. Although his match with Shurman was the first time I actually thought he might lose.
@mytweethurts I was thinking the same thing. ITS FUCKING FAKE MAN. lol. I do wonder how long they will keep it on Taven. I hope 4ever! lol.
Tigers CF kinda looked like Juan Pierre for a second.
@mytweethurts That damn thread on facebook lol.
@RameyRants 16-9?
I've only seen that penalty called one other time. It was on the Devils years ago. John Madden I think.
@RameyRants This game is never gonna end. And you know Price is sucking when even Beltran gets a hit.
@gabriellenadine Your fav NEW fan says we need a new champ. Fuck that!
Gerry Davis is a mother fucking idiot.
Umm where was that last pitch?
@RameyRants We'll give it right back.
GOD DAMMIT WARREN.
@RameyRants Fucking Rob sent the runner who would have been out if the catcher had the ball.
Ballsy to send the runner there.
@RameyRants Ellspenis doesn't have an rbi? How is that even possible?
Man for some reason the Yankees really do well against David Price.
It is fucking snowing in Detroit right now.
@RameyRants I had off, you could have sold me some bedding.
@RameyRants Next time, tell me BEFORE the work day lol.
How the fuck does Daredevil get around the city? Does he have a fucking voice activated gps? lol That's the only thing that gets me about DD
@RameyRants Milford is about a half hour away.
Didn't really like the movie but I hear the show is good so I'll give it a watch.
Watching Daredevil. Just not sure I like a superhero that's fucking blind.
@ecw5575 Yeah Chrome is terrible though.
@RameyRants Greg Hardy lol.
Wrestling Paradise WWE pickups.: 
Shits pissing me off lol.
No walmart in CT has WWE cards anymore.
@AlexLorenzoCT Yeah, that's when they did it. Duh.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Damn dog, I wanted a selfie!
@AlexLorenzoCT It wasn't. I forget who it was.
@AlexLorenzoCT 
@AlexLorenzoCT Idk, but Shurman has be on tv multiple times. Once as a hot dog rose bud.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Aww. RIP buddy.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy LOL. Snapchat me a pic with the robe!
@AlexLorenzoCT Did you know Shurman and Taven have been on WWE tv as security?
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Which robe?
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy I thought Leonard was your favorite thing?
@RameyRants Tigers pen is awful.
@RameyRants WHEW.
Oh for fuck sake. #Yankees
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Working at Restoration Hardware now and its so much better then CB. Actually enjoying it there.
Fuck you Gerry Davis. He swung.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy That's awesome! Glad to hear everything is going well!
And somehow we have turned this into a save situation.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Where are you working?
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy I still can't remember that stuffed animals name.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Hey fuck you I'm a big deal on twitter!!!! lol. I'm good, long time no see. How is everything with you?
@Heather8522 Idk why shit always has to change.
@RameyRants You'd be interested in doing a fantasy football for money, right? Might even have an in person draft.
@Heather8522 I love you.
@L3tsN0tG3tCrazy Creeper.
@mytweethurts Good times.
The new Android update is a pain in the ass. It doesn't show you who texted you when you drop down the menu. It just says "new message"
@dabest6678 Our girl Lisa Ann retired last year. Very sad.
@dabest6678 I never saw this tweet lol.
Fuck Beltran, let Young play.
Apparently I've been living under a rock bc I had no idea Lisa Ann retired. So sad lol.
I think the Giants have a good shot at making the playoffs. D will be the deciding factor.
I don't like having divisional games so early in the season. Giants only have 2 after the bye week.
Giants after the bye week should be able to finish the season strong. Not an overly hard road.
Well the Giants season starts off with a bang in Dallas.
Eovaldi needs to strike more guys out.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Less douchey though.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT He kinda does.
@mytweethurts I'm sure there are plenty of female wrestlers in New England to build a division too.
@mytweethurts Hahahaha.
@AlexLorenzoCT Could you imagine if Preston got on Tough Enough? Hopefully they aren't only looking for 18-25 year olds.
If @WWEToughEnough doesn't select @ThrillrideCW then they are completely insane. Guarantee you won't find anyone with those promo skills!
Watching WrestleMania IX for some reason.
@mytweethurts I think @newwrestling1 needs a female division, don't you think?
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 That's not Legends price at least.
@clairerobinson5 Is 5 fix done? I need you on my tv!
WWE 2015 box #5 Topps Chrome box #15 Contenders #5 6 Platinum #2: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Unless you are Jake Roberts, a DDT is a lame finisher.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants No way, at least Rollins is different.
But at least its not as lame as Dirty Deeds.
Rollins new move is literally a DDT where he falls forward instead of backwards. @RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT
Of course I missed that RKO bc I was typing lol.
Why would Rollins bash Kane again? After saying he was sorry? That makes no sense.
This Jets game is out of control.
That Winnipeg crowd is amazing.
@RameyRants When did he wrestle on SD?
Can Sandow go back to being the intellectual savior?
Remember when Bray Wyatt actually wrestled?
I actually hope Miz wins so we can go back to Sandow, but Miz is probably going to film that dumb movie soon so he'll probably lose.
@Rozz33 Not at the moment.
WWE: Redoing gimmick matches with different names. Then. Now. Forever.
@RameyRants Slater already got taken out.
Albany almost had a John Cena sucks song going.
@RameyRants The media is also why the Yankees suck.
@RameyRants Yeah he looked awesome.
Sheamus wins by DQ lol.
@RameyRants No fucking clue.
This segment reminds me of 
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me ITS A REMATCH OF THE WWE TITLE MATCH FROM YEARS BACK!
Cole said Every time you get down I'm gonna knock you back down. Fucking botch fest tonight.
They could make this RKO thing hilarious if they do a bunch more.
Naomi is a pathetic heel.
CC pitched great, but knew it was only a matter of time before Det scored.
@RameyRants Somehow we are top 5 in the league in runs scored. That blew my mind.
All awesome valid points. Kane wins that argument lol.
That was Kane's best promo ever.
Lets hope the winner of Tough Enough is better then the last one.
1 man and 1 women win so why not have 10 men and 10 women compete?
@AlexLorenzoCT Stamos is gonna get on Tough Enough and win.
For the love of god @TripleH get @ThrillrideCW for Tough Enough.
I know Orton has 0 chance of winning on Sunday, but I'm actually rooting for him.
Why on fucking earth would you have New Day win?
Ambrose and Harper are meant for each other. Tables match on Sunday?
Cole just said Harper got sent into the LED boards by Harper.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT I have no desire to even watch Raw tonight.
@AllyOMalley02 Hope you were just watching the Yankees game!
Of course I missed the Tex homer.
I hate people who use facebook as twitter. Don't fucking facebook post about every fucking thing that happens, USE TWITTER.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Wonder what he'll use now. Hopefully something cool. Phoenix splash?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants They'll say he so good his move is too dangerous.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT I never really liked that move but come on. Not like anyone has ever gotten hurt.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT That is so dumb.
@aFleuryofsaves Win tonight!
I still think Batman vs Superman is fucking stupid.
@AndrewPfefferle Happy 420. #faggot
@aFleuryofsaves Happy birthday Kayla! Go Pens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RameyRants Mostly criticizing the CT Sun for not drafting well.
@RameyRants Dead serious.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Fucking RD needs to do some signings.
This kid is the definition of strength. What an amazing human being. 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Why didn't we get tix for ROH best in the world in June?
@RameyRants Let that sink in. One would have been acceptable, 2 or more crazy, but 7?????????????????????????
@RameyRants You know that tool ring announcer for NEW? I saw his twitter and he had 7 tweets about the WNBA draft. 7. Seven.
@RameyRants And if that is really him do we think this was real? I mean nobody can be that stupid, can they?
@RameyRants Has this been confirmed to really be him?
@gabriellenadine You're not real!
@gabriellenadine @AlexLorenzoCT @ramblinon_ Still sad that @ThrillrideCW retired Porn Star Dancing. #YupMovement
@gabriellenadine Its still real to me
@mytweethurts Oh hell yes! Cannot wait to see that.
@mytweethurts I'll introduce myself as MacGyver so there is no confusion. #ILoveTheCock
@mytweethurts It was hard to figure out who you were without the Flair costume the first time!
@mytweethurts The matches were off the charts AND we got to sing the Charles in Charge theme. #win
@mytweethurts I just realized that I've never actually formally met/said hello to you. How rude of me.
@gabriellenadine @AlexLorenzoCT @ramblinon_ Zombie is gonna crash and ruin the wedding.
@mytweethurts Printing out the lyrics was fucking brilliant. Next month bring lyrics for get outta my dreams! Peacock signs were amazing too
@AlexLorenzoCT @gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ And Anthony's and Chris Battle's fiances.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT LOL.
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine @AlexLorenzoCT And unfortunately we are at the end of the aisle for that show. Hello view of the ring post.
@AlexLorenzoCT Ha, still don't know if that is true or not.
@AlexLorenzoCT Anthony cost Zombie the tag title match and hes in a feud with him, but next month they said its Anthony vs Dredd. Wtf?
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine @AlexLorenzoCT So @AnthonyArmy has the same birthday as me. We all going out to celebrate?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Where'd you go on vacation?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I wanted to smack him for taking a selfie.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Its so bad they don't want people to see?
We are almost at 900! 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Nice.
I have to tuck my shirt in at work and whenever I go on break or leave I feel like Rafael Soriano when I #untuck #Yankees.
I can't post Northeast Wrestling footage anymore (despite my vids being seen by people who otherwise wouldn't see NEW) Tonight was amazing.
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ Its always fun going with you guys. Nice to have wrestling buddies! Can't wait for Dijak vs Taven!
@gabriellenadine At this point I've got a collection going so I'm trying to remember which was which show lol.
@gabriellenadine I can't remember!!!!!!
@gabriellenadine Which show did we both get some of Tavens tape?
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ Oh really? Why did I forget that?
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine Who is buying tix for the 28th?
I'm pretty sure @MattTaven recognizes me by now. I didn't even have to ask for his wrist tape tonight. Amazing match tonight #champ
@ThrillrideCW Don't get me wrong I like the new song, but its not the same without Porn Star Dancing. Absurdly entertaining tonight as usual
YUP! @ThrillrideCW
@MrGriffinB Wiz in 3.
NEW tonight with @ramblinon_ and @gabriellenadine. Lets go @MattTaven!
@mytweethurts Got your singing voice warmed up?
@Gregsies Either Montreal or Tampa has to knock off the Rangers bc it def wont be the Pens or Caps/Isles.
@Gregsies I had the Caps before the playoffs, but they sucked in game 1. Game 2 they looked so much better so idk. I'll stick with the Caps.
@MrGriffinB Tough game 1, eh?
@Gregsies I know, but they are both listed as NBC.
I love how both games right now are supposed to be on NBC.
How the fuck is that a penalty on just STL? #Blues
@RameyRants I hope it was only a concussion and not neck problems. Bryan is gonna have to retire soon, isn't he?
@RameyRants Bryan got a concussion in his match vs Sheamus on the Europe tour. Sheamus is becoming a dangerous guy lol.
Holy 3rd period penalties in the Flames/Canucks game. Jesus.
@RameyRants Betances has to prove he doesn't suck before he can be one half of that. Last night was a start.
@GoldStandard000 It was trash last year too. Big money players doing 0.
Alex couldn't have asked for a better start. I hope this stupid home run bonus doesn't fuck things up. Its in his contract, just pay him.
In other news A-Rod is trying to carry our team. Wow.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Long read, but really absurd 
This is a long read, but its an insane story. 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I hope they have some good figures.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT I bet Phil Ditto likes the ST.
Unless 2 teams from the Met make the playoffs. Stupid.
Wow I just realized with the new stupid division playoff format, Rangers vs Devils can never happen in the conf finals again.
Man Islanders vs Rangers would be so sick.
The Caps are the worst playoff team ever.
Who the fuck kills a cat? Let alone with a bow &amp; arrow and then BRAG about it on facebook? I know people are sensitive but this warrants it
People are so fucking stupid and do not think about shit before posting it on social media. 
If you are gonna give Kay a series off, just let Kenny call the damn game.
Can YES please stop letting Flash do play by play? Hes awful.
Come on St. Louis.
Fucking god damn it Blues.
Guy singing the anthem in STL is fucking awful.
@RameyRants Hahaha. That was hilarious. Who forgets how many base runners there are?
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine So ready for Sat. Hope Team Friendship doesn't split up!
@RameyRants 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT @jetsfan3754 What is the price point?
Def getting sick...At least get it out of the way before my vacation?
Fleury is terrible. I'd have 0 faith in him.
This series is already over.
@KevinKoov Thanks!
WWE Ringside unboxing. Shawn Michaels edition.: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 Yeah I just wont spend that on a hobby box. I spend it on other shit I don't need lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I was gonna sell that one lol.
@GoGetMyCoffee Hey happy birthday. Hope everything is going well!
God the NHL playoffs are so much fun.
Shannon Hogan is kinda cute. #Islanders
Most people seem to be picking Chicago, but if Rinne gets hot he could carry that team very far.
@GoldStandard000 That wasn't too bad. I think I got 3 hits.
Ovi is never gonna get out of the first round lol.
@GoldStandard000 And I don't think my chat is working.
This game is out of control.
@GoldStandard000 Who was that last auto?
@GoldStandard000 Let me know if any Ducks hit. Mine keeps freezing.
Shorty for Montreal. Hockey justice.
100% a penalty, duh, but come on.
That isn't a 5 minute major.
A major penalty? Really?
Oh boy Montreal just got retarded.
@GoldStandard000 I'm in!
When it rains it pours. Montreal with 2 quick ones and that crowd is fucking nuts.
Holbty would probably be the last goalie I would want in these playoffs. Maybe Fleury.
Holtby sucks.
That Tanaka commercial is hilarious.
Man I'd really rather watch the playoffs then the Yankees lol.
This year we've seen some amazing goalie play. Dubnyk was on fire earlier this year.
Hammond was 20-1-2 to finish the season. Good fucking lord that's insane.
@yankee32879 Yeah not a fan.
@metrangerfan711 They'll both get knocked out in the first round. Watch.
Am I the only one who doesn't like how you play in the division in the first 2 rounds? (with the exception of a wild card here and there)
@metrangerfan711 Is Bishop playing well?
@metrangerfan711 I'm sayin' unless they score 20 goals, they have no shot lol.
@metrangerfan711 Montreal has Carey Price though. If he gets hot....Montreal is my only hope of beating the Rangers.
Taz was the worst announcer ever. Please god don't let him go back to WWE.
YES! TAZ IS FINALLY GONE FROM TNA. I can actually now watch TNA and laugh instead of just reading about it and laughing.
@MissJtotheK Ur biased lol. I think the Caps will take it.
@metrangerfan711 I think its pretty much guaranteed. Unless Crosby and Malkin wanna score like 20 goals...
I virtually guarantee the Rangers will at least make the conf finals. They will destroy the Pens and then face the Caps. They own the Caps.
@metrangerfan711 Yeah they are so good in the regular season and just don't have it in the playoffs.
I also think Nashville will be one and done. Hawks are the most tested team in the playoffs.
I'm rooting hard for the Blues, but almost guarantee they will get upset by the Wild. Hope I'm wrong.
@AlexLorenzoCT Wooo.
Today it starts. #AnyoneButTheRangers
@RameyRants 77 in a row? How is that possible?
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 Yeah those are nice.
@RameyRants Did you see Bryan isn't doing well at all? So depressing.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT And it also says Eden is a first time signer, which is a lie. Lesnar autos are sick though.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Already see problems lol. They have the same Hogan cards (unless its just a preview and they will change it)
WWE 2015 box #3 4 Topps Chrome box #12 13 Contenders #3 4 Platinum and Strata #1: 
@RameyRants Ugh.
@RameyRants I don't think we will ever be over .500 this year lol.
Hey the #Yankees finally scored a run.
@TheDaveLorenzo LalalalalalalalaFontaine!
@TheDaveLorenzo C'mon! Tanaka actually had a good year once!
Can't wait for those Tanaka bobbleheads to be on ebay for an absurd price.
@Seanfranchise6 There we go. Refreshed like 5 times before and nothing lol.
@Seanfranchise6 Doesn't show you are in it. What the hell?
@RameyRants 5 out Sabathia!
@Seanfranchise6 Yeahuh!
I also love how the picture for the new Steph figure is of here in her SummerSlam gear, yet the figure is of her in a suit. What?
Ringside is of course out of stock of the Sami Zayn figure. Ugh.
@RameyRants Like they said, even before the Knee issues, he really didn't cover first.
@RameyRants Posses me off too.
#YouKnowWhatReallyGrindsMyGears? Someone stops responding mid text message conversation.
Literally 0 fans behind home plate in Baltimore.
NHL bracket challenge for fun. Pw is Ambrose 
@brookeeelynnn27 Hey congrats on picking a college!
@AlexLorenzoCT He is so fucking bad lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT Who is the moron kid who wears the suit doing interviews? The kid we saw at Five Guys?
@AlexLorenzoCT They cancelled a show on Friday. Wonder what happened.
@AlexLorenzoCT Had to make the last 2 NEW vids private bc they asked me to take it off. Fucking lame.
How do you make the worst season even more awful? Win your 2nd to last game to not have the worst record in the league.
THE FUCKING KNICKS WON AGAIN??????????????????? YOU IDIOTS STOP.
Either way it was a fucking awesome move by Neville.
That 450 by Neville was amazing.
@melanie_papalia Yeah that only added to the beauty =)
I at least like how they did it. Having Kane chokeslam him and then put Rollins on top of him.
What the fuck is with this laying down for Seth Rollins shit? God his title run (as short as its been) has been god awful.
@RameyRants Are we really sending Miller out there for 5 outs? Or who the fuck is pitching the 9th?
A 5 out save? Or who the fuck closes?
I don't think I will ever forget being there the night Fandangoing first started and acting like total idiots. It was amazing.
@Daynamite13 You have my favorite display name on twitter!
Fandango face turn ftw!
Fandango just Fandangoed!!!!!!!!!!
@RameyRants Never heard it mentioned ever lol.
@RameyRants Had no clue.
Wonder what Betances did during the off season to turn into a walking pile of suck. We need him to stop. #Yankees
And were blowing it
@AlexLorenzoCT @metrangerfan711 @RameyRants @CManettas Just a bracket.
@AlexLorenzoCT @metrangerfan711 @RameyRants @CManettas Not even close.
Now if we can hold that lead. #Yankees
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO first screaming moment of the season. #Yankees
Wow is it bad that I had absolutely no idea JD Drew was Stephen Drew's brother? @RameyRants
@RameyRants @metrangerfan711 @CManettas Password: ambrose 
FUCKING Yankees cannot score.
That was an absolutely awful 1-2 pitch. #Yankees
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Fuck that bitch!
The Ascension had so much hype and they literally did nothing with it and now they job.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Yeah odd.
They turned Naomi heel? When she manages faces and when there is a lack of face divas?
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Fuckin' Murph.
I liked Paige more when she was single lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Its a piece of shit.
When Raw is taped, I don't even remember that its on lol.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Plus Canada doesn't count in the scheme of life.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Toronto is a major fucking city tho so you'd expect that. Little old BPT.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Hartford is an A too.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me It says some are ranked twice based on different trips.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me I can only assume its bc its the WWEs home state?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Are you asking like it should be an F or are you asking bc its ranked twice?
Never been a fan of getting on a guy like that. Like that is gonna help. Not to mention ITS BEEN 6 GAMES.
Wow any Yankee fans that chant Derek Jeter at Didi is a fucking idiot.
So I guess it doesn't matter that the ball wasn't fully in the glove then? #Yankees
@melanie_papalia I liked The Den. You are sexy as hell!
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Wonder if they will be chained together or just use chains as weapons.
Clicking on the score of any game on 
Crappy internet..........................................................
Always disappointed when I see @J2thecarpenter still hasn't tweeted since Oct Also given up on her ever seeing fan mail I sent to her agency
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Also Ambrose had to face Adam Rose. I mean really? Poor Ambrose.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Orton vs Rollins is in a cage and Orton is banned from using the RKO.
Already found another error in the @wwe magazine about Mania. Says Rey Mysterio vs Cody Rhodes happened at 25 and it was 27.
Wow huge mistake in the special @wwe magazine. It says Bret Hart "bested both his brother and Yokozuna at WMX" Yeah he lost to Owen.
I could easily see the Wild beating the Blues, but I'm rooting hard for St. Louis!
@RedDevilsGoalie Your post reminded me about it!
Forgot the password. 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RedDevilsGoalie Password is Ambrose.
@MrGriffinB @BallerWShades Both of you join 
@MrGriffinB @BallerWShades I hate when twitter doesn't remember who I tweet most often and I can't remember the exact handle lol.
Why does the WWE  network work perfectly some days and then others it constantly buffers and freezes?
@MrGriffinB Wtf is TJs twitter? I cannot find him
Anyone wanna join an NHL bracket? 
@RedDevilsGoalie @MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT 
I always hated that they took away the best part of Fandango, his theme!
Apparently Fandango's old music played and the London crowd loved it!
Can Paige dump her boyfriend too? =P
Paige isn't going to beat Nikki for the belt since she has to go film that movie. She'll probably get fucked up and written off tv.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Cena vs Rusev in a Russian chain match at Extreme Rules.
Russian chain match at Extreme Rules??????? WTF is a Russian chain match?
@metrangerfan711 @CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT Nah not really, but if it was Chris would have fit in.
@CManettas I'm mad at you for not choosing FU. @AlexLorenzoCT
If you are going 60 on the highway, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE LEFT LANE. #roadrage
@MeghanMcDermott Are you from Forest Hills?
@RameyRants This is gonna be a long year.
I want a tattoo of the old WWF logo. 
@RameyRants lol guarantee you there is no captain after Jeter.
@RameyRants Yeah, but Joe Kelly is way better.
@RameyRants Did the Cards really think it was necessary to trade Joe Kelly for fucking Lackey?
The ESPN announce team annoys the shit out of me. I do not enjoy watching games on ESPN. Plus that stupid K zone!!!!!!
@RameyRants 9?????????????????????? Jesus.
@RameyRants We just tweeted each other after an hour at the exact same time.
@RameyRants That's the last thing we need is to tell the other fucking team whats coming.
@RameyRants Tanaka is tipping his breaking ball. Schilling said something about his arm angle being so obvious when its a breaking ball.
@RameyRants Once a week we'll do this and the rest of the time its 1-2 runs.
Yeah that is exactly what is going to happen.
This is going to be the Yankees all year isn't it? 1 game out of the week they'll score a shit load and the other 6 they won't score at all.
Kayfabe is dead. No need to tweet in character lol @LanaWWE @JRsBBQ
@MrGriffinB Its a 2016 pick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MrGriffinB Its 2016, ass.
@MrGriffinB Dude the Knicks have their own first round pick. Look at any mock draft.
@MrGriffinB Devils also have a 7.5% chance of winning.
@MrGriffinB The Knicks have their own first round pick.
Knicks need to win the lottery. Devils need to win the lottery. Yankees need to learn to hit. I hate life.
The fucking Knicks need to stop winning ANY games. Tied with Min now for worst record.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I really hope the PWS legends show is good.
@BGross94 Pat Buck is so bad on commentary for PWS. He makes Byron Saxton sound good.
@AlexLorenzoCT @TripleH I think I'd actually be upset if someone went to Bobby's and didn't get them. #timetoeatthenachos
@AlexLorenzoCT What are the odds that @TripleH gets the pulled pork nachos? Has to, right?
@AlexLorenzoCT Someone sent me a snapchat.
Ahhhhh @TripleH is at Bobby Q's. @AlexLorenzoCT wish I was there too.
The NHL playoffs haven't even started yet and I already want it to be October.
Cammalleri has been one of the best FA signings the Devils have made in a long long time. Great first season.
Devils need to develop more scoring. They have the goalie and the young defensemen.
That is a horrible call on Bernier. Refs were idiots on that one.
They did change the format. Still can't find 100% fact that there is no limit to how much you can move up, but I think anyone can get #1.
Did the draft simulator and the 2nd time the Devils won lol. "New Jersey Devils had a 7.5% chance to win the lottery."
I'm almost positive when they took Larsson after winning the lottery they only moved up 4 picks.
Wait did the NHL change its lottery format? It just said they would pick 1st if they win the lottery. I thought you could only move 4 spots?
@RameyRants Couldn't even go 20 innings? Lame.
@MariaLKanellis Not sure if I've ever seen you look better then you did tonight. Love it!
@MickieJames You still got it? Nah, you never lost it! So nice seeing you wrestle in person again!
As usual @MattTaven, @RealMikeBennett, @VivaDelRio and @ThrillrideCW put on an amazing show for NEW. Always great seeing them.
@RameyRants If I knew where there was a Little Ceasers I would lol.
@HaniaHuntress Haven't seen you since PWS supercard last year! So pumped you will at the NEW show tonight. Those abs!!!!!!!!!!
@RameyRants Brilliant isn't it?
@RameyRants Over/under on slices of pizza I get tonight is 2.5.
@AlexLorenzoCT From the way @chmurph talks in that video, he must watching wrestling a lot. That only makes me love him more.
@AlexLorenzoCT Murph is the fucking man. Wonder if he watches wrestling actually.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT I only got fatter, that's about it.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Which one of us?
@AlexLorenzoCT I don't think Vlad being the first person you see on the list of guests is smart lol.
Here is a throwback for sibling day with @AlexLorenzoCT when I was the one with an Amish beard. 
NEW tonight to see @MattTaven vs @VivaDelRio. I want Taven's wrist tape!
@mmoorewriter No. They usually go up as soon as we do them, but nothing coming.
I love @ConanOBrien
Kristen Stewart has a hot voice.
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me Only if they are on my dick.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me And honestly 80 bucks is a fucking steal.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me We can't even hang out with Mikey in Fairfield let alone Rhode Island lol
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me Maybe I'll do the one with Shelley for Breech.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me Except Zeus if I could find a sweet poster with him and Hogan.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me I don't think I'd meet anyone, but I'd go to hang out with Mikey.
don't understand how twitter changes all the time when you hit the tab button. Usually it goes straight to tweet, now it goes to add photo
@AlexLorenzoCT Plus its 45 for Friday plus a bullshit 7 for fees.
@AlexLorenzoCT I'd go meet Paige, but I just realized she has a boyfriend and I'd probably cry.
@AlexLorenzoCT Come home for Friday to meet Orton.
@AlexLorenzoCT I'm sure the lines are absurdly long. Not sure I'd want to go alone anyway.
This would be my dream WWE title match with Ambrose winning. 
I also hate Kevin Skaff.
I hate the Masters not being on tv until 3. So dumb.
I also had a dream I met @jakeandamir and @JakeHurwitz and annoyed them with JA quotes the whole time.
I had a dream that I went to the Super Bowl with @RealPaigeWWE.
@TheBethPhoenix Recognize the guy next to me? 
@DanGurewitch Fuckin' Dandruff Sandwich!
@ramblinon_ Section D.
@ramblinon_ You are going tomorrow, right?
@RameyRants Couldn't find another Del Rio MITB figure so unless someone has one tomorrow for a decent price, I'm not meeting him lol.
@RameyRants I want that so bad.
Wow nobody is going to hit 90 points this year.
@MissJtotheK They wont now.
Wooooooooooooooow are the Kings really gonna blow it tonight? Damn.
Devs need all the scoring help they can get, but idk if they would give Bernier what he could get somewhere else. Still want Jagr back!
Bernier is pricing his way out of Jersey. Somehow he has 16 goals this year and will for sure get a raise.
@RameyRants Yeah and we actually won yesterday!
@RameyRants Jesus its gonna be a long year.
@RameyRants Thanks DEJ.
@RameyRants He sucks donkey ass just like Matthew McConaughey.
@RameyRants Foul ball straight back and he acted like he got hit in the head.
@RameyRants I hope Fallon dies.
Was that fucking Fallon pretending he got hit in the head? Fuck that guy.
@RameyRants Wow wtf was that Didi?
@RameyRants We only scored there bc I left the room.
@RameyRants I cannot make sense of it.
@RameyRants Its incredible how inept our offense is.
@RameyRants Oh and in other news, we still can't hit.
@RameyRants CC has 8ks already and looks great. Yankees starters seem to have 1 inning that ruins the entire game.
Here's to the curse of the presidents trophy winner continuing again this year!
@Quinn_Williams He was def not. Michael's reaction was also not lol.
@BenNordstrom I'm so sad they ended. Hopefully their TV show gets picked up.
He just turned 21 so what chance has he had to drink alcohol? Come on Kenny, really?
@RameyRants Well Miller should officially be the closer.
Yankees first win is in the books!
@dabest6678 @BenNordstrom I want to flip both your dicks.
Thank god he got hit bc you knew he wasn't gonna get a hit lol.
@iloveajlee01 @AlexLorenzoCT Nope.
Ugh Betances getting no help.
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 Did he say something about black?
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 What was that Steelers card?
@RameyRants Ugh I know.
#RejectedHobbies Masturbating.
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 I hate people who show up late and then ask if anything broke yet. FUCKING DUH.
@RameyRants Didn't realize his control was that good.
Geez that is a long time to go without getting even a single double play ball. #Yankees
How many Yankee fans are ready to kill themselves? I know @RameyRants is ready!
@AndrewPfefferle Nice profile picture. Wanna fuck?
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Bc he looks like he lives in a swamp?
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT lol
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 That shit was from how long ago?
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 That made me lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Bobby did you see Alex's newest video? Where he says is this Arizona? When the Arizona logo is right on the can?
Razor Ramon defining moments figure!: 
Topps Chrome box break #8-11 Contenders box #3-4 and Leaf Draft first and last: 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Song made him look strong.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me 
@BenNordstrom Its called a "maymay"
Thank you @jakeandamir and @JakeHurwitz. Jake and Amir has seriously brought me so much joy its ridiculous. @tbsveryfunny GREENLIGHT THEM!
I'll watch Jericho and Cena later if I hear it was good.
Very good Raw. Crazy to say that without Ambrose, Bryan or Ziggler. Still don't know why they weren't there. (of if i missed it lol)
The crowd is completely dead for this match.
Can Sandow get his own name and theme now?
@mmoorewriter @IAmJericho @EdgeRatedR Haha.
Is the WWE running another house show against Raw or something? No Bryan, Ziggler or Ambrose.
Thinking Steph could even land a punch on Ronda is dumb. If we don't see Rock vs Brock maybe Rock/Ronda vs Trips/Steph.
Having Steph vs Ronda makes no sense. Steph can't wrestle at all. Rousey vs an actual wrestler would be a good match.
No Bryan or Ziggler yet?
I mean come on, no more lobster head and too many limes!
I'm a sucker for theme songs with no words so I like Sheamus' new song, but its not nearly as good as his last one.
@RameyRants Big Show was also falling before Reigns hit him.
I think @IAmJericho needs to remind Cena that he and @EdgeRatedR were right and the Nexus should have gone over.
Stuffed crust pizza is probably one of the best inventions of all time.
@RameyRants Are they gonna be smiling and happy heels?
Jesus fucking Christ, New Day is so awful.
@MikeyTheAwes0me That's what happens...To bullies.
@RameyRants Anyone else. Please.
@MikeyTheAwes0me I don't think there is a single person on earth who would know what that means besides us.
@RameyRants We fucking just saw him feud with Show...And it was turrible.
@RameyRants He is over enough to be champ, but never will =(
@MikeyTheAwes0me Get the hell out of my damn face...BACK.
So what if Orton wins tonight? Who does Reigns start to feud with?
@RameyRants Harper is good as a singles wrestler. Its Rowan who sucks.
@RameyRants That was actually funny.
Can the WWE please bring back Cryme Tyme? It would make myself and @RameyRants so happy.
Kofi don't talk about my chest Kingston lmao.
That PTP shirt is freaking awesome. Has the old Prime Time Wrestling text.
Wow can Naomi not be the one to win the Divas title next?
This Raw might have the best wrestling in years.
@RameyRants See what happens when you put on wrestling matches?
I need to become bffs with @RealPaigeWWE then slowly work my way out of the #friendzone
I kinda wish I had paid attention to both matches lol.
Neville and Stardust have been awesome tonight.
@RameyRants I wish.
I fucking love Stardust's theme.
I don't think I'm gonna bother watching Jericho and Cena.
I think defending the US title every week is pretty fucking cool.
They could have given Neville a boost by having a rollup win there.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Generico.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT He actually spelled Aykroyd correctly lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT President Heral Ford!
@AlexLorenzoCT Whoever buys the last spot in the 3rd one is an idiot.
@AlexLorenzoCT I'd take that mystery hit over everything. Even the Durant.
Rollins just pointed to his waist and there was no belt. Idiot.
If they are smart they have Neville get the upset.
Would have been better if it was Ambrose.
@AlexLorenzoCT Why not just do it and find out already.
@AlexLorenzoCT Is he retarded? I guarantee if he scratches it, it only shows a code.
I bet Trips and Steph side with Kane. If they don't its just stupid. So basically Rollins wants the Lesnar treatment and defend a few times.
@AlexLorenzoCT Nothing has been worth it. That mystery hit is probably the best.
@AlexLorenzoCT That's a terrible hit for the price.
@AlexLorenzoCT So far the 3 hits have been terrible.
I love Rollins being upset. Does he think he can just never defend the title?
@AlexLorenzoCT Chat is being gay.
@AlexLorenzoCT So fucking slowly I might add.
Wow you know Raw is gonna be awful when the first thing you see is Big Show.
Did they ever say wtf happened to Triple H's leg/ass?
THE AUTHORITY ISN'T AT RAW. THANK GOD.
Holy shit Saxton is getting another chance.
@AlexLorenzoCT How the fuck is Lethal still the TV champ?
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ I kinda want a picture with @MattTaven and that IWGP tag title!
I think @nbc needs to just let @ConanOBrien use his old characters and clips. There is too much gold just buried that can't be seen.
Bryce Harper needs a fucking haircut.
I'm gonna miss @BrianStack153 dude is hilarious.
So is Conan allowed to use NBC clips now?
@ANWild119 @AlexLorenzoCT Too bad RD lost the ROH titles.
@AlexLorenzoCT Yeah I think so.
@AlexLorenzoCT Does conquerors include Lesnar?
@AlexLorenzoCT  Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Inventors Innovators Athletes,Presidents, Queens, Comedians Astronauts Conquerors Entertainers
@AlexLorenzoCT It has shit like they had in GOAT. Actor autographs and shit.
@AlexLorenzoCT Can't wait to see Super Break Insane Ink.
I hate the #friendzone, right @dabest6678
Jays lineup is legit. Not sure I trust their pitching staff though to be able to make a playoff run.
Even the Yankee fans are missing the mark today 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Bad day all around. 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Idk why it says starts at 15, the cheapest seats are 25.
HEY WE SCORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RameyRants This is depressing.
@RameyRants @alexlorenzoct 
Unboxing from @GuyInGreenWWE.: 
Todd McLellan will probably get fired and Dan Bylsma is still out there. Interested to see what Lou does at the HC spot.
I would eat a bag of dicks for Mike Babcock to be the coach of the Devils. Wont happen, but I can dream.
Oh and it was going so well.
@RameyRants Maybe I just wasn't paying attention. It was probably that.
@RameyRants They announced Thompson as 3rd.
Surprised Dickey isn't their starter.
@RameyRants So Tony Pena isn't the 1st base coach?
I was 1st, 1st and 4th going into the playoffs in hockey and lost in the finals of all 3 leagues. Fuck me.
lol there is nobody at the stadium.
@RameyRants Did you see Tanaka said he knows his velocity is down and knows it wont return. Fucked.
And just like that the Cubs are already losing. Have their fans given up?
Schilling has a terrible voice for broadcasting.
@Seanfranchise6 So unnecessary.
I've never really been a fan of baseball on ESPN anyway.
Live K zone?  That box constantly being on the screen is fucking annoying. Anyone else?
Why the fuck would the Braves have spent money on Markakis then?
Wow the Upton brothers are together again. Braves are really selling off.
Amazing recovery by Paul George. Good for him.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Absurdly stupid camera angle lol.
My fucking hockey team was the best all year and of course in the finals they shit the bed.
@RameyRants Wait Betances is sharing closing duties with Miller?
@MrGriffinB Weirdo with 2 favorite teams.
Happy Easter 
@AlexLorenzoCT Genius.
@AlexLorenzoCT Yeah. Didn't he write it?
Duke already beat Wisconsin once, can they not do it again please?
@ADARBECK So sexy in Exam!
And I don't see Calgary or the Canucks doing anything. Also fuck the Wild!
And don't count out the Kings if they can manage to get in.
I really don't know who is gonna come out of the West. I don't really trust the Ducks, Blues, or Preds. Only the Hawks seem legit.
@mkyek828 Lets go B's!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully I don't have to spend as much time rooting against the Rangers in the playoffs as I did last year. #letsgoanyoneelse
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine Sorry its a snapchat only thing!
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine You'd have see the sweet Shield Lego set I bought!
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Nah I'm working.
Heres the vid when we met @WWEAJLee and she loved the MacGyver shirt. Maybe she'll do conventions now?
Am I the only one who thinks lip sync battle is fucking retarded?
I highly doubt we'll see her in UFC, but who the fuck knows. I always thought she'd be a lifer after being such a huge fan growing up.
Kinda surprised @WWEAJLee hasn't said anything yet. Always a sad day when someone retires. Hope she does some awesome stuff in the future.
@CManettas @BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT AJ would totally do me!
@CManettas @BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT So what? Shes fucking hot, I'd meet her again!
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Wonder if Legends can ever get AJ.
Whatever workout @WWEAJLee is doing, its working. Her abs are amazing.
Guess she lost the passion for wrestling just like her husband. Or she plans on having kids soon! Too bad.
WOW. AJ retired.
WWE Toys R Us pickups.: 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Aww.
@gabriellenadine Everything I send you I always pause a second to send to @ramblinon_ then remember shes too good for snapchat!
@gabriellenadine Can we get @ramblinon_ to join us in 2015 and get snapchat already?
.@RealPaigeWWE being in a movie makes me want to see it. The Miz being in the same movie makes me not!
@dabest6678 I'll text you when I wake up.
@dabest6678 At the casino?
@dabest6678 Probably nothing.
@dabest6678 Is the beard back?
@dabest6678 lmao wtf
This is great, but how is it a "prank" 
@dabest6678 I don't think that is possible.
@dabest6678 Hahahaha.
@dabest6678 How Its Made episode on right now is going to show how above ground pools are made!
@RameyRants He was an awesome heel with that song. Such a good song to go unused now.
@RameyRants They did that enough with the hair.
His song sounds like generic rock.
WWE changing Sheamus' theme song is so fucking lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! His song was so awesome.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB We are gonna spend a fortune on tickets lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB Only 200 level seats are left. I say we wait.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB Fuck, do we buy tickets for the Raw after SS now?
@MrGriffinB You know Raw tickets for the day after SS went on sale right?
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Sterling football is all I'll buy into.
The new 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Some nice stuff we can't afford.
@amberstulken I don't mind giving away base/insert cards, but not relics. I only have one Miz now and I'm keeping it.
Hopefully they can draft someone who can score.
Devils are the 6th worst team so the best they can do is the 2nd pick.
@GoldStandard000 Wtf? 
@GoldStandard000 Is your scoreboard at the top cut off?
The Devils are better off just losing in regulation instead of gaining meaningless points in OT.
Did 
@Brittin95 Nobody wants to see that!
Keira Knightley in Jack Ryan is so fucking hot.
Lorenzo basement tour.: 
AHHH. Wizard World will be in St. Louis just after I leave. Could have met Batista and Paige.
@AlexLorenzoCT That was fast.
Target and eBay pickups. WWE, NHL and Dexter.: 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Those look nice.
@mmoorewriter Thanks!
@RameyRants I hate myself.
@jsmeza2o They want to do Rock vs Brock I think.
I think Sting will wrestle next year. They wanna really stack the card.
HAHAHAHAHA Bo Dallas is getting to cut a promo on Sting.
Wouldn't a win have been better if he does indeed wrestle again?
I love how they booked Sting to lose bc they don't know what (if anything) hes gonna do in the future.
If they start to do the Fandango they you know they've lost it.
Now this crowd is trying to be like the Jersey crowd after 29. You were good tonight, but not as good.
@RameyRants And when did you get married? Or that 2nd earring?
@RameyRants That doesn't surprise me literally 1 bit.
Yay Reigns as the 3rd man.
@RameyRants I hung posters all over your house
@RameyRants You are always tuned out.
@MikeyTheAwes0me 
I think King said Cervical damage. Can they rehire JR? #iwish
@MikeyTheAwes0me Yeah I wish he said that.
@RameyRants What did King say was wrong with Cole? I couldn't understand him.
Cole has possible what damage?
How pissed would you be if you had front row seats and fucking King and Byron were STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU THE WHOLE NIGHT.
@RameyRants When did they call his move the An-Cole lock?
@RameyRants 
@RameyRants 
@RameyRants We are trying to forget about him.
@RameyRants LOL wooooooooooooooooow. We are dumb.
@AlexLorenzoCT Who is she CM Punk at WM29 axxess?
@AlexLorenzoCT @gabriellenadine Aw how sweet to put her over like that.
@RameyRants Ryback's gotta be one. Rowan seems like kind of a let down, but idk who else it'll be.
AJ's shirt seems like something @itsBayleyWWE should be wearing.
LOL you can clearly hear Cena yell "cover me"
@RameyRants Can Reigns go back to feuding with Big Show?
@RameyRants I would think Orton will come out and say he beat Rollins so he should get a shot.
I refuse to let myself believe that Rusev will screw Cena out of the title and Ambrose will win
@RameyRants No I'm not gonna get excited.
@RameyRants WHAT IF RUSEV COSTS CENA THE TITLE??????????????????
Except Ambrose is gonna get buried.
OH FUCK YEAH AMBROSE! Not quite Ambrose vs Rollins, but this could be good.
@RameyRants What if its Orton?
God the John Cena sucks chants are so awesome.
Yay another new Cena shirt!
@RameyRants And they will just call her Char.
@RameyRants Hes fine on color, but as a lead, hes god awful.
@RameyRants Can't wait to see Owens just be called Owens.
People don't just have 1 name.
What the fuck is the WWE's obsession with removing guys first names? Seriously? Who is next? Zayn? Balor? So dumb.
Byron Saxton is terrible.
@RameyRants They got rid of his fucking first name.
REALLY? WWE REMOVES ANOTHER FIRST NAME?
LOL Ax-treme rules.
Do they really need to show us what happened all week?
For fuck sake JUST FLIP THE TABLE BACK OVER.
@RameyRants It makes me sad that Miz main evented a WrestleMania.
Miz said "no one's nothing without me"
@RameyRants Tom Phillips isn't good. Where is Graves?
@CManettas Now that is what people want to hear!
@AbWheresTheC Not a chance.
Do they really not have anyone to go out there with Byron?
@RameyRants So its just Byron. They have nobody else that can do color? Really?
Wait, is Sandow really still using Miz's theme and the Mizdow name?
Can we get Suplex City shirts?
@RameyRants God I'd give anything.
Can we start a movement to get Ambrose vs Rollins?
Well I guess the suspension was a good way to keep the rematch clause intact.
Are they still really putting these assholes on stretchers?
@RameyRants Give me 2 years of JR.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT At first I thought it said Man Taven.
@RameyRants It'll be 2 hours of just King.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT I wish it was.
Can Cole be killed off and we bring back JR?
@AlexLorenzoCT I can't wait for @BGross94 to favorite that tweet.
LOL hes suspended. He'd be off tv anyway, what a lame way to do it.
@RameyRants GET OUT OF MY HEAD.
I'd pay so much money to see Steph get F5'd.
GREATEST. THING. EVER.
OH MY GOD PLEASE KILL COLE.
What a cock tease.
This will end in a DQ.
@RameyRants That belt is too fucking big.
That belt is far too big for Rollin's waist.
@RameyRants Something has to happen.
This match cannot be happening right now.
@RameyRants You'd think.
Lucha Dragons ripped off Fandangoing.
@RameyRants I was hoping it would be Cryme Tyme.
@RameyRants NEW...day sucks.
@BlaineSZN Nah that'd be too awesome.
@RameyRants What's a heal?
Wonder who answers Cena now. I mean a rematch would be a letdown.
@RameyRants Someone on fb said "Always felt sheamous was better as a heal"
OK no get rid of the beard jewelry too Sheamus.
@RameyRants He needs to ditch the mohawk. I wonder if it was to try and get heat for looking dumb? He doesn't need it lol.
Oh how I've missed heel Sheamus.
I can deal with the weird Jack Sparrow beard, but the mohawk has got to go.
Go back to being the guy who ended Jamie Noble's career!
I'm sorry, but I cannot take Sheamus seriously as a heel with a mohawk.
And hes got the Jack Sparrow beard.............HE TURNED HEEL YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh for the love of god what is that haircut Sheamus.
So say Rusev answered Cena's challenge and lost. Would he still have his rematch clause?
@Brittin95 I kinda want him to come back and beat the shit out of Bryan and Ziggler and be a heel.
@RameyRants Haven't said that in a while.
@RameyRants Get out of my head.
Hmm maybe Sheamus answers Cena's challenge?
I say there is no way Rollins loses the title.
Wonder if Sheamus will turn heel right away or not.
@hecdaboss Yes. To Austin.
They really had to fly him to NY for that interview?
Lesnar just called her a bitch lmao.
I kinda wanted there to be a storyline lawsuit. That way we'd get to see Vacant be champion again!
I'd laugh if Rollins lost the title after a day.
You can tell this crowd is already hot. I bet its gonna be a night on par with the night after WM 29
Lesnar doesn't need to drop Heyman to be a face, hes already a fucking face.
I read that the boos for Reigns weren't even remotely as loud on tv as they were in person.
Lesnar looks like he never changed lol.
How about not cut a 20 minute promo? Rocks segment took far too long. I'd have loved to see Reigns get his ass kicked another 15 minutes!
Only the WWE could have 4 hours for like 8 matches and have to cut down the main event bc the show was running long.
@RameyRants Where are you going now back to the Danbury mall?
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Geez.
I think I'd give my left nut to see Ambrose vs Rollins for the title, then my right nut to see Ambrose win it!
@RameyRants Stop it. We'll never get to see that.
@RameyRants Maybe they won't be in the WWE title picture for a while?
Rollins vs Orton for the title? I'd rather see that then Rollins vs Reigns for the title.
@RameyRants This makes me angry.
So say Lesnar appears on Raw tomorrow and doesn't leave as champ, who does Rollins feud with? I mean Orton did just beat him.
WWE had 7 fucking matches over 4 hours and NONE OF THEM got to the 20 minute mark. @RameyRants How is that possible?
If Brock never wins back the title then maybe we get Rock vs Brock next year. Wonder if their back up is Rock vs Trips? On to SummerSlam!
Def the best Mania of the last few years.
That's the thing about a part time WWE champ, he doesn't get in feuds. Highly unlikely he'll be at Extreme Rules, but you never know.
Rollins vs Lesnar vs Reigns at SS?
You think Lesnar will be at Extreme Rules or do we wait until SS for his rematch? @RameyRants
Finally we can have a WWE champion on tv every week!
Congrats to @WWERollins well deserved, but I hope one day Ambrose also wins it.
I find it funny that people say Reigns isn't ready, but don't say that about Rollins or Ambrose.
@RameyRants Technically he didn't.
It took me so long to realize it was Rollins music that hit lol.
So how long do we have to wait for Lesnar's rematch?
@RameyRants Perfect ending and everyone is happy.
EXACTLY HOW I SAID LESNAR SHOULD LOSE.
HAHAHAHAHA REIGNS DOESN'T WIN.
Perfect way for Lesnar to lose or Rollins to get the case off of him and not be champ.
GOOD LORD ITS ROLLINS.
FOUR FUCKING F5S.
@RameyRants Hes so bad at being safe with the ring post lol.
Man Lesnar cannot take a bump into the ring post to save his life.
Even when Reigns is getting absolutely destroyed, hes looking strong. @RameyRants
OK for fuck sake, even Taker didn't kick out of the 3rd F5.
I was pissed we didn't get an actual match at SummerSlam, but I am enjoying watching Reigns get fucked up.
I would love Reigns to get destroyed and lose, but I think its an awful thing to do at a WrestleMania main event.
Man if they were worried that Reigns winning and not being ready would ruin him, I think a Cena like beat down would be worse.
@Titan4Ever2488 No. It isn't.
Reigns is gonna look like superman when he wins and I'll die a little on the inside.
@Titan4Ever2488 Dude, a calendar year means THE SAME YEAR.
LOL he hits an F5 already. Can't wait to see Brock make Reigns look strong.
Come on Brock!!!!!
@Titan4Ever2488 Yeah, that isn't a calendar year lol.
14-15 isn't a calendar year Cole. You idiot.
LOL the pyro guy should get fired for fucking that up.
I hope to good Heyman doesn't turn.
It never Reigns in Northern California. Hes getting the shit booed out of him!
WHO GETS PRE MATCH FIREWORKS?
@IHeartCrosby They cut away right as the security was beating his ass lol.
@marstonk1 That is THE worst.
@RameyRants Maybe they'll actually go to 11:00 on a ppv for once.
Reigns shoved that guy who got too close lol.
@RameyRants Please!
Telling me Lesnar can end the streak, but lose to Reigns? Fuck off. Lets go Brock.
Here we go, one of the least popular main events in Mania history.
@RameyRants I don't understand.
See. Taker's record can't move off that 1 loss. The streak ending means more when its just 1 loss. Taker's still got it
I just got way too excited for that finish!
LOL look on Taker's face was priceless.
Does anyone ever lose after just 1 tombstone anymore? lol.
Come on Taker.
@Seanfranchise6 I blocked that match from my memory lol.
Did Taker hit a tombstone on Lesnar last year?
This is the WWE after all. I need to prepare myself for Wyatt winning.
Taker can have more then 1 more match after this if he stays in this shape. I'm impressed.
22-1 come on baby!
Ok whew. Lets have a good match.
@RameyRants Good god Bray is gonna get squashed.
Bray is gonna get squashed.
That short hair is throwing me for a loop too. As the dead man hes never had shorter hair. Even at WrestleMania XX it was longer.
This feels so fucking weird watching Taker wrestle with no streak. I feel strange.
@RameyRants Man he looks 100 times better.
Hes got short hair. So weird.
@RameyRants Hahaha.
Can the Undertaker please win and have a match next year at Mania and do axxess? I'll pay anything to meet him.
He already looks better then he did last year.
Even with no streak, Taker is the best part of Mania.
Taker losing again would piss me off so much.
When was the last time the dead man had an entrance in the light? WrestleMania IX?
@RameyRants Rollins would have to cash in and lose or win then lose.
By the time Wyatt gets to the ring, it'll be dark. Slower then Orton.
Wait no match build up promo? Shocked.
@RameyRants There is no way they would do Brock vs Rock for the title right? Why would the Rock deserve a shot?
They almost killed enough time for the sun to go down.
Wow we got a fallopian tube mention.
This is the longest fucking promo in ppv history.
Oh my god she is.
Can Ronda Rousey lay Steph out?
If Brock is still champ by Mania 32, the wont face the Rock for the title, that'd make no sense. Do Trips vs Rock. That'd be so awesome.
Start a "this kills time" chant.
Set up a match for Mania 32?
I bet Trips is still bitter that he was never as big as the Rock or Austin.
They trying to kill time until the sun sets after 7?
Rock wins the Slammy for tightest shirt ever.
Where is Austin?
@RameyRants Ur way behind aren't you?
I actually would love to see Rock vs Trips at Mania.
Wow. Didn't expect to see the Rock. Or a fucking promo.
Vince should come out.
Why is this bitch still talking?
LOL a new attendance record, the fucking stadium just opened.
OH COME ON. EVEN AT MANIA WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE AUTHORITY.
So poor Sheamus has been ready to come back and hes still gonna miss Mania.
@RameyRants Ladder match was good, but too short.
@RameyRants Its been good, not great though. No match has stood out as a classic. My fav was Orton and Rollins in think.
So I wonder what Lana is gonna do after she finishes filming that movie. Can she wrestle? I never want her to leave.
@RameyRants Or shes dating Cena's dad lol.
Why the fuck does the Rock's mom need to be at Mania and in the front row?
Rusev will get nowhere without Lana.
But it only took one AA. That is kinda lame.
Well that wasn't a bad way for Rusev to lose and it gets Lana off tv.
@RameyRants He just did a spring board stunner.
Ummmm Cena just did a spring board stunner.
So why did she throw the shoe if it didn't even get used?
OMG Lana's feet. @MikeyTheAwes0me did you mark out?
I think it'd bury him less if he just got pinned.
I'm thinking Cena doesn't even pin Rusev, hes gonna make him tap out. Which is worse.
I like Eden, bu god damn U-nited states gets annoying.
@RameyRants That would've been awesome.
Didn't think I'd see George W. Bush on Mania.
@MikeyTheAwes0me I just realized Barrett is closer to Jericho then Kofi is.
Is Cena gonna have his own army?
Lana's shoes are always way too big for her. I don't know why I even noticed that.
Hes riding a fucking tank. Awesome.
How come they didn't get Putin to come down to the ring with Rusev and Lana?
@meyersMMA35 Fucking Triple H.
@RameyRants 40 minute beat down of Reigns?
@MikeyTheAwes0me He needs it even more then Kofi does.
@MikeyTheAwes0me Which is why he'll never go anywhere. He needs the IC title.
I'm all for making the US title more important and Cena winning wouldn't even piss me off, but I think it can be done without Cena.
Oh for fuck sake, every year at Mania its a must win for Cena. Fuck off.
It just dawned on me how weird it'll be to see Cena holding a midcard title.
Macho Man is finally in the HOF. What can the IWC complain about in its replacement?
God Rikishi is one of the worst HOFers ever.
Rikishi didn't mention Too Cool bc apparently they had a falling out at an indy show. Most people only care about Rikishi bc of Too Cool.
LOL you needed a super computer for that? Makes no sense.
@jeterfan28 lol
@RameyRants I guess the WWE title match is an iron man match.
2 hours left for 3 matches.
Wow I'm surprised AJ and Paige won.
AJ runs weird.
It literally does fucking nothing.
The rack attack might be the worst finisher ever.
@RameyRants Just when we think the shovel is in the closet, it comes out again.
@RameyRants Fucking Triple H.
I've seriously never heard of Kid Ink. And I'd also like to not be hearing him sing right now.
Skylar Grey get off my screen.
@davo_77 Hahaha.
Not a fan of Triple H winning at all, but DX and NWO shit was really cool.
Wow they are really trying to push that IC title.
When did Savage ever say Whoa Yeah?
@RameyRants WWE is pg yet they are having an MA cartoon?
NO NOT THE DIVA SEARCH...........NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@davo_77 Yeah Trips fucking won.
Wait WWE network is having a TV MA cartoon???????????/
@RameyRants I hate Triple H winning.
If they just made it about Sting wanted to stop Triple H from being an asshole Sting coulda won, but they made it about WWE vs WCW.
Only the WWE would have turned it into the WWE vs WCW and have Triple H win.
And the shovel comes out yet again.
Sorta expect the NWO to turn.
Wonder if Trips got dry iced again this year? Although his ass looks like it has a massive bruise.
Flair should come help Sting.
That god all these guys came down bc this match wasn't very good until then.
@RameyRants We both tweeted that lol.
I think Nash tore a quad.
What in the fuck happened to Trip's ass/leg?
@RameyRants DX vs NWO. Only 17 years too late.
ITS 1998 AGAIN!
GOOD LORD THE NWO.
Where are the WCW guys?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW DX.
And you can hear everything Trips is saying to Sting.
Fucking John Cena's dad takes up a front row seat.
@RameyRants Sting was tired after 1 minute. Its clear hes already out of gas.
Its kinda obvious that Sting is too old for this.
@RameyRants Oh yeah no dq some shit is happening. Like Sheamus can join the authority?
Last year's entrance was better.
So this match is no DQ now? When did that happen?
That entrance was reported to be "epic" that was just kinda stupid.
What was the point of raising Trips all the way up to just come back down?
This entrance is so fucking retarded.
Lets be honest, WrestleMania is no Starrcade.
Charles Robinson the old WCW ref doing this match.
@RameyRants Is this ppv gonna end an hour early or are the divas getting a 45 minute tag match?
Sting's haircut is pretty awful lol.
Stings entrance would have been better in the dark.
Sting is coming out first?????????????????????
Unless Trips Terminator entrance is gonna take about 45 minutes.
6 matches and 3 hours. One being a Divas match. You telling me the ladder match couldn't have gone another 10-20 minutes?
Its a fucking 4 hour show that hasn't even been an hour yet and we are already on the 3rd match.
@RameyRants Well they have to wait until its dark for Taker vs Wyatt, but yeah that seems early.
3/4 matches I got right. I usually suck at picking lol. Lets go Sting!
That might be my new favorite RKO.
Fantastic finish to a really good match.
Just when you think they have run out of ways to do a super RKO, they come up with something new.
WHAT AN RKO!!!!!!!!!!!1
I think the kicked out on instinct line is so fucking dumb.
@AlexLorenzoCT Lame he cant get on Mania of he's healthy.
@JenDeach88 Lol most people do.
@RameyRants More likely he will if he loses.
@RameyRants I don't think he will. Wouldn't shock me but I don't see it.
Maybe Sheamus comes back in the Cena match to either save Cena from a Rusev beat down or to turn heel?
Um Orton wearing elbow pads? I don't like change. @RameyRants
@RameyRants So Sheamus just not gonna be on Mania? Even though hes healthy?
Still don't understand how you can bet on a fake sport.
Wow the betting odds favor Rollins in this match. I really think Orton will win.
The suplex to Stardust and the power bomb to Ambrose were awesome spots.
That match was awesome. Wish it went even longer!
Are they really saving Sheamus for after Mania? Or does he come and save/screw someone?
Wow there are seats behind the stage. Those have got to suck...Um and where is Sheamus?
Ambrose looks so fucking badass.
Honestly I'd rather sit at the very top, then sit on the last row of the floor. Those seats look like you can't see anything.
I would be so pissed if I paid for a front row ticket and there was a ladder blocking my view.
Lets go IC boys. Steal the show!!!!
Did LL really just say a once in a lifetime event?
Lets go Ambrose/Bryan.
What is Sheamus returns and wins the IC title in 18 seconds?
I don't know why America the Beautiful being sung is a tradition at Mania. Sing the Anthem.
I don't know what was worse, Booker T being dumb and getting the city hes in wrong multiple times or the fact that nobody has corrected him.
@NJDevilRae Yeah too bad.
Best match of the night starting off the show.
@RameyRants Booker T is worst the Truth getting the city wrong.
SOMEONE CORRECT BOOKER T FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. That moron has said the wrong city at least 3 times.
Having Big Show win that match is completely worthless. What a fucking joke.
Dandow is going Benoit 04 Rumble on Show.
So can we go back to calling him Sandow now?
My feed is behind, but Mizdow better win.
Fuck this battle royal.
@RameyRants Dear god no.
Fucking Big Show better not win.
@RameyRants Its not like winning this gets you a push or anything. Just ask Cesaro.
@RameyRants I would think so. Nobody else is any good.
He grew a Bo-T. That's amazing.
OK so no Sheamus in this match, must mean he'll be in the IC title match.
Whoa, all the tag team title match guys are in this too? Can Cesaro just win again please?
@BookerT5x Santa Clara NOT SANTA ANA.
@davo_77 Hahaha.
@CManettas Shes gotta be in amazing shape. I bet she could.
Booker T is so fucking stupid. YOU ARE IN SANTA CLARA NOT SANTA ANA.
Its not like the WWE would ever plan a match 1 year in advance or anything.
God they could actually do that next year to stack the card. Have the Bellas vs Trish and Lita.
Oh nice that was a sweet tag by Cesaro.
Thank god Cesaro won!
Fucking Uso is gonna win it by himself.
Ref just made it seem like Big E wasn't legal, yet let him stay in the ring and fight.
Can't wait to see the fan reactions to Reigns.
Holy shit look at Natties boobs!
That is on the line of unnecessarily big. Look how fucking long that stage is! Crazy.
Good lord that is the biggest stage ever.
Come on Kidd/Cesaro.
You aren't in Santa Ana Booker.
Hopefully Bray's ankle sprain isn't too serious. I just don't see Taker losing 2 years in a row. Then again it'd be weird for Bray to lose.
I wonder if Paul Heyman knew Brock was gonna win. I assume so, but his reaction was so good, it looked genuine.
They don't even have David Guetta who sings the Mania song.
I hate musical performances at wrestling events even when its someone huge. Kid Ink and Skylar Grey? Why, just why?
Not sure if that is the best last name ever or the worst?
There is a college basketball player in Canada who's real name is Guilherme Carbagiale Fuck. What the hell?
@CManettas Yeah and if you go to FU, we can ride around in it and make out.
@BigBernieCool Yeah I saw Bray, Taker and Rusev have crazy entrances.
@CManettas Yeah I have a DeLorean.
I wish the WWE would spend less time on these entrances and more time for the actual matches. Like do we need to see HHH as the Terminator?
@CManettas Or I'm predicting next years Mania bc I already know the card!
@CManettas Asshole it was a typo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Typo corrected! 
@AlexLorenzoCT Especially with a gay name like that.
@AlexLorenzoCT Yeah no lol.
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Wow they took the belt off Fallah already. Bokara won it back last night.
@mytweethurts Those signs are too brilliant to throw away I hope!
@mytweethurts Do you keep all the signs you make? Do you still have the Taven/Charles one?
Mania day is finally here!
@mytweethurts That is amazing!!!!!
Lets get Mania over with. Hoping for a good show.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Habib returned and won the 6 way title!
Nash gonna tear his quad during his speech?
Still don't know why they are letting Nash go in as Nash and Hall had to go in as Razor Ramon.
Wow I guess my feed was way behind, it just jumped from Hogan to Lanny.
Didn't Savage hate Hogan when he died?
@AlexLorenzoCT I got 10 dollars credit for my lost Randy Johnson card.
@AlexLorenzoCT Did you hit in PT?
@AlexLorenzoCT Did you get anything?
Someone tell me when its Macho Man's turn. That is all I care about.
@RameyRants Haven't been able to find another Del Rio mitb figure though.
@RameyRants I officially have April 10th off!
Baseball yet?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me 
Lets get to Mania already so we can move on to SummerSlam!
@FoodNetwork Can we get some more @clairerobinson5 and 5 Ingredient Fix airings please?
@AlexLorenzoCT What the hell was the video you uploaded and deleted?
@mytweethurts Yes! Yes! Yes!
@mytweethurts Holding you to this! I'll never forget my first NEW show Tag Wars where you were dressed as Flair singing Charles in Charge!!!
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine Yeah one of the coolest things I've seen in person. He and Bandido should be an awesome match.
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ 
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine I'm so pumped Dragon Shynron is going to be at Sure Thing. Hes amazing and that card is really awesome!
@mytweethurts Bobby Ocean has a match at the April 18th show in Bethany. If I don't hear at least 2 Billy Ocean songs, I will riot!
@BGross94 @AlexLorenzoCT Dragon Shynron is wrestling for NEW!!!!!!!!!!!
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ ROH added a show on the same day so they are moving it.
@gabriellenadine @ramblinon_ They are moving the show to a Sunday most likely.
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine I'd have gone even if none of the ROH guys were there lol.
@ramblinon_ @gabriellenadine Did they decide on a date?
@Nytemare10 So odd.
@Nytemare10 Good lord wtf took so long?
@AlexLorenzoCT But 40 was the highest I would go.
@AlexLorenzoCT I might take a chance now, but I doubt it. I wanna save money for St. Louis.
@RameyRants Especially if Roman turns heel bc of it that would mean he would win. And fuck that.
@RameyRants He did well in the interview on espn but live on raw I think he's better with Heyman.
@RameyRants He needs to not turn face even if he gets cheered. A guy who wants to beat people to death isn't a face!
I know Lesnar gets a lot of cheers, but I think the beast gimmick works better as a heel. Especially with Heyman.
Its been almost a year and the streak ending still pisses me off.
@RameyRants I do not wanna get mine up!
@RameyRants Don't get too excited.
@RameyRants I kinda need to see the chick hes with.
@RameyRants Should have seen Owen coming.
@RameyRants Explain to me how he has a fiance? Granted shes probably absurdly fat and ugly, but still!
@RameyRants OWEN HART AHAHAHAHAHA OH DEAR GOD.
@danieltosh Thanks for making the 1% of your audience who watches wrestling also. I marked out.
@RameyRants Hes totally alienating his whole audience bc 99% of them don't get any of this lol.
@RameyRants Wtf was that bleeped out part about Kevin Costner?
@RameyRants Ugh I'm gonna go start the episode right now.
@RameyRants Ur making me want to go watch it right now dammit.
@RameyRants I love that Tosh loves wrestling.
@RameyRants I know I'm recording it!
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 But that's rough lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Its cosmetic surgery anyway.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Sunny is trying to raise 10k for cancer surgery, Bobby you in for 500?
Stephanie must really not want anyone to see what her daughters look like. She only tweets pics of the back of their heads lol.
@Rozz33 Yeah.
@Brittin95 @YouTube Haha not quite as much as FULL FIGHT AND REVIEW lol.
Brock Lesnar resigns with WWE and officially retires from UFC.: 
I really don't think Mania's card is as weak as some people do. I think its better then 29 and 30. Looking forward to it.
@BGross94 Sounds like even if he wanted to go to UFC the offer was too good.
That was the first time I've watched SportsCenter in years and it was bc of the WWE lol.
What is Coach talking about performing 4 times a week? He performs like 4 times a year.
God I'd love to see how much WWE gave him.
Can't they make Brock do axxess?
So this will not be like WrestleMania XX where we new he was going to leave.
I can't say for sure bc I've never met him, but I know people who have and he was a dick, but maybe hes not?
This interview is making Lesnar look like an actual decent human being lol.
LESNAR IS COMING BACK. PLEASE BEAT REIGNS.
@MikeyTheAwes0me @AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants HES COMING BACK!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW HES NOT GOING BACK TO UFC. AND HES COMING BACK TO WWE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT
Lesnar is on ESPN right now.
Topps Chrome Football box break #7 and Value Packs: 
Hogan wasn't even booked on the card. I can't remember why, must have been filming something or something like that.
Oh so WCW's random drawing for team WCW only had 6 names on it lol.
Would you really leave it up to a random drawing? Why even bother? Although I bet Disco Inferno would have been awesome on team WCW.
WCW had a "random drawing" to see who would face Hall and Nash. LOL what? It just happened to be 3 of their best.
WWE network has 99% of all ppvs, but are missing a shit ton or Raw and Nitro episodes. Come on.
I love Schiavone saying "I guess it was premeditated from all the way back in 94" lmao
@AlexLorenzoCT No video yet.
@WWENetwork ADD MORE NITRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @wwe
And when he came out its not like Hall/Nash were cheating or anything. But Heenan yelling whose side is he on was so fucking dumb.
I hate how WCW botched Hogan's heel turn. Fucking Heenan yelling "whose side is he on"
@RameyRants 
@AlexLorenzoCT I'll check.
@AlexLorenzoCT When I upload on the computer it does it automatically, but from my phone it doesn't.
@AlexLorenzoCT OK it showed up on my paypal. Thanks.
@AlexLorenzoCT Yeah. Are you sure you sent me money?
@AlexLorenzoCT Glad it works with no problems.
@AlexLorenzoCT roaddawg71@aol.com
@AlexLorenzoCT Did you check your bank account to confirm we got paid? Pay me.
@AlexLorenzoCT @WeThePiwko I bet you can hardly taste the difference since it already has chipotle sauce on it.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT I hate the espn rosters with those dual infield spots.
@AAB777 lol
CSB unboxing. New York Giants edition.: 
Why not just get HBK or Scott Hall or Triple H or X-Pac or anyone who did anything with Nash lol.
How does Mick Foley inducting Nash make any sense?
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Yeah I like yahoo a lot better then espn.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT I've only ever paid to do football leagues. Yahoo league?
@GuyInGreenWWE @AlexLorenzoCT 50/50 split bitches.

@AlexLorenzoCT We got paid so send me my 50 dollars and 50 cents!
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Weird.
@CMPunk Hawks have 94 points and are in 3rd in their division. How do you even pick a favorite out West?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Could it be over already? lol
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me Apparently AJ unfollowed Punk and Punk posted "Hello to wasted hours. Bottoms up to Better days"
That was so fucking stupid lol.
THAT'S HOW they end the Raw before Mania?
I know people think Reigns could turn and Heyman turns on Brock, but I don't ever see that happening. Brock needs Heyman if he comes back.
I don't think Brock liked that comment about Sable.
Only Ambrose could DDT Ziggler and not get booed.
Bryan lost to Ziggler twice now. Totally winning the ladder match.
Shocked Ambrose only got 57%
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Ambrose looks almost as good in an LJ as you do.
So is he going in as Diesel or Kevin Nash? If they made Hall go in as Razor then wtf?
So they wouldn't say Scott Hall last year, but this year they will say Kevin Nash?
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 That is awful. Rotisserie leagues are so boring.
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 Not only is csb baseball 55 bucks and a dynasty league where you keep every player, its ESPN and roto
I miss @LanaWWE
Is that LED board on the apron something they are going to do from now on? Its kinda cool I guess.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT You'd also probably be wearing a leather jacket.
I hope the Vikings tell Adrian Peterson to go fuck himself and don't trade or release him and just let him sit out another year.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants How hard is it to do those Hogan poses yet everyone who does them with him fucks it up.
Snoop gets an F on his Hogan poses.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Axel is getting a segment with Hogan. That is amazing.
Can we just take a minute to bask in the fact that Axel has gone from not being on tv to being in a segment with Hulk Hogan. #winning
Whoa, that is pretty cool. Didn't know Hogan was in the building.
Can Axel mention how long hes been in the Rumble next year in January please? I love it.
And the 2nd week in a row a Divas match went long enough to get a commercial break.
Best Divas match in a long time.
Why the fuck would they even have Rollins as an option. They are fucking fighting at Mania.
@MrGriffinB Yeah who cares, weren't you just watching Bill Simmons talk about Andre?
@MrGriffinB Andre.
@Brittin95 I'd be wearing Giants blue!
So why hasn't ESPN done #Andre30for30?
I love @BillSimmons
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I also think they will go with Bryan and Cena winning to elevate those titles.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants WWE has forgotten shit before. They could just not give him a rematch. Or he just doesn't lose.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Lesnar should lose the belt by not getting pinned or submit. Or getting screwed on a cash in.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I never said it was gonna be a bad match like most people think, I just don't want Reigns to win.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Yeah absolutely not. I could barely afford the cheapest package.
@AlexLorenzoCT 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Yeah you flip flop and booed him now cheer. No consistency.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I never wanted Reigns to win anything especially before Ambrose.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB Plane tickets don't come in the package do they?
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I'm the exact opposite. The fuck would you root for Reigns for?
@MrGriffinB Yeah too bad @AlexLorenzoCT can't go to Mania next year. Although I suppose if we took diff flights he could miss less school.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants I might make a prediction video bc fucking @MrGriffinB said I should.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants Orton will win and Rollins will cash in soon I think.
If I go to Mania next year you can bank on the fact that the card will suck. I never have luck with that.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants The Authority will never be done.
Really interested to see Sting wrestle a match to see what hes got left.
@metrangerfan711 He knows it'll get a pop so that's why he stopped using it. Smart, but I miss it lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants That would be so fucking stupid lol. I think Sting in his first Mania match will win.
Best part of seeing Trips at Mania is we finally get to hear his real theme song again.
I'd pay money to see him scorpion death drop Steph right now, but she has a dress on.
Hey how can we ruin a Sting promo? Lets have Stephanie come out. Fuck.
I know Sting is ripping Trips for storyline purposes, but everything he just said was true lol.
I'm surprised they had Sting not talk ever since SS, but the last few weeks he is talking.
You would have to think that Sting is one guy that Triple H can't bury and beat at Mania, right? @RameyRants
Pretty poetic that today is the exact day that Vince bought WCW and that Sting is kicking off the show.
@RameyRants Are you pumped for Bill Simmons?
Officially going to St. Louis in May to visit @BenNordstrom and see my first Cards game!
CSB unboxing. MLB.: 
WWE Topps 2015 Box Break #3 and 4, and a nice hockey TTM: 
WWE Topps 2015 Box Break #2 Blaster packs, and Topps Chrome Value packs: 
@CManettas @AlexLorenzoCT Fucking Marinara sauce going to FU would be amazing.
@AlexLorenzoCT No card or ttm video?
@RameyRants 
I still like @FastNLoudTV, but why does every show about building shit have to go all crazy and show less and less of the ACTUAL building?
@metrangerfan711 @BGross94 Oh right lol. Wednesday 25th.
@BGross94 @metrangerfan711 
@AlexLorenzoCT 
@MissJtotheK Fantasy baseball! 
@AlexLorenzoCT Sent out emails 3 times to everyones email for fantasy. Even Ramey joined already.
@AlexLorenzoCT Will you join the baseball league I invited you to 3 times already.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Might meet nobody. PWS better not suck.
@RameyRants You never told me!
@AlexLorenzoCT 
@RameyRants What the fuck we let Pat Venditte go?
@AlexLorenzoCT Are they doing that or is there a hold?
Totally botched watching the Devils tonight.
@AlexLorenzoCT Its all pointless if you can't figure out how to get paid.
@AlexLorenzoCT Whenever I see Sam's reflection it looks like Dr. Hauptman.
@GoldStandard000 Tempted to get in the random, but probably wont.
@GoldStandard000 14K is still pretty sick for a card.
@GoldStandard000 I think BG looks really nice.
@GoldStandard000 Is that real gold? Like 14K or something?
@AlexLorenzoCT Doobs can't be dead!
@AlexLorenzoCT Fuckin' Ed Helms!
@RameyRants Something is bound to go right eventually. I hope.
@wwefan1991 Not too bad. Been to any PWS shows lately?
@RameyRants Insane. I wonder what he could possibly see to predict that?
Dear snow. Go fuck yourself.
@RameyRants I'm leaning towards the Yankees.
@rameyrants Not sure what is more insane, Buster Olney picking the Yankees to make the playoffs or that his WS is Pitt beating Seattle.
I was all ready to watch some NCAA games and then I saw Dirty Jobs was on.
@wwefan1991 Hey Ashley! How have you been?
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me God I know.
The WWE network needs to add those old school Coliseum home videos. I'm in the mood to watch them and don't have a VCR in my room.
Like if you click on a part of the line, it goes where ever it wants.
WWE network on the computer needs to let you rewind and fast forward to any part and not just random parts.
Rewatched the ending of Survivor Series and I knew Ziggler stayed down  from a pedigree but Rollins took a zig zag &amp; was out the whole time
@ramblinon_ Yeah! Thanks.
I can't tell if this mark is real or pretending. I guess it really is still real to some people 
@AlexLorenzoCT @RameyRants @MikeyTheAwes0me How am I just seeing this now. Hes getting on Tosh next week 
Undertaker WWE unboxing.: 
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Depends on how it looks too.
@alexlorenzoct Have you tried depositing money?
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT I haven't even gotten a 2015 hobby box yet.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT Ugh high end is too expensive though lol
@AlexLorenzoCT I was looking on ebay for those, there don't seem to be too many out there.
@AlexLorenzoCT You got a ttm from MI.
I feel the need for a free hug from @itsBayleyWWE.
@AlexLorenzoCT @GoldStandard000 Man those tribute autos from @toppscards are god awful. Almost every single one was smudged.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT Might be the worst name in sports.
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT So that's why Hartford Yard Goats was trending.
@alexlorenzoct I uploaded it without the first pack. Stupid to wait.
@alexlorenzoct That Josh Gordon card was a ball from a game vs the Bengals. 41-20 Bengals.
Panini Fathers Day Packs.: 
@RameyRants Ugh.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT People asked for an NT hockey hit draft? I can't afford 95 for 1 card.
@GoldStandard000 @AlexLorenzoCT How much were the Yankees anyway?
Tell me I did not just wake up and see snow on the ground.
@alexlorenzoct Why the hell did you like a bunch of pictures on fb?
@RameyRants @AlexLorenzoCT @MikeyTheAwes0me 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 And now we can all meat him lol
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 Officially announced. Knew it.
I'm beefing so hard about Jake and Amir ending.
@MissJtotheK Fine. I'm madly in love.
@MissJtotheK I think I love you =P
@CollegeHumor Why is the episode of @jakeandamir Vote part 2 not on youtube?
Oh my mother fucking god Jake and Amir revealed who Mickey is. I was hoping they wouldn't, but it was pretty funny.
@RameyRants How would Tanaka not get the opening day start if hes healthy?
@RameyRants I'm just realizing you probably don't have cablevision?
@RameyRants How much are we paying him?
@RameyRants MSG's package doesn't include its fucking sister channels? What the hell?
@RameyRants How is that possible. Shouldn't it be the same package with YES?
@RameyRants You don't have MSG?????????????
@RameyRants And I feel like you haven't watched the Devils this year as much as the last few years. I'd blame you, but we sucked the last 3.
@RameyRants The fatter the better!!!
I was thinking, how the fuck could Crosby only have 52 points so I rewound it and yeah no lol.
Did Dano not realize that those stats for Crosby were against the Devils in his career and not this season?
@RameyRants That name mad me lol.
@RameyRants 
@RameyRants The less shootouts the better. I wanna see 1 on 1!
@RameyRants on 1*
@RameyRants 3-3 is awesome, but the challenges are weird to me. Only one 1 type of play which results in a goal.
@RameyRants Look at my previous tweets. I'm too lazy to retype everything lol.
@AlexLorenzoCT You need to check gmail and do whatever adsense says.
Playing 7 minutes with the first 3 being 4-4 and the rest being 3-3 is weird to me. Just to regular ot like it is now, then if needed 3-3.
Why not play 4-4 for 5 mins then 3-3 for 5 mins? 
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 At least that is someone new.
@AlexLorenzoCT @BGross94 I think Dean Malenko is gonna get added as a vendor. Hes touring with someone the same day as Legends.
@RameyRants As long as he can hit.
I'm watching Nitro episodes and to kick off their 2nd hour, they changed commentary teams and set off pyro in the middle of a match.
@RameyRants We need a year with few injuries.
@RameyRants Both Ellsberg and Ellsbury have quad strains?
@AlexLorenzoCT It cost less to ship something to Sue that weighed more then it did to send that figure to CT.
Cablevision guy just said "wow nice collection" #winning @AlexLorenzoCT
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Maybe tickets will drop. If not we either find 6 or we split up if its much cheaper.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Wow shes actually gonna make him buy a ticket. We will just have to wait until much closer to the show.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT I know TJs cousin is coming, who the hell now?
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Who the fuck is 4 of you now?
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT We need 6 tickets now? Jesus.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Sitting in the 200s will be at least 150 plus whatever fees stubhub or any ticket site has.
To anyone who buys shitloads of tickets to resell them at absurd prices. Go fuck yourself and die.
@MrGriffinB @AlexLorenzoCT Like sitting in the first 10 rows make it much better. It sucks that all the scalpers got tickets.
@AlexLorenzoCT @MrGriffinB Were going to have to sit in the upper level for SS. Tickets beyond that are just too expensive.
@OGGspaceman Thanks dude!
@MissJtotheK Happy birthday gorgeous! Hope you have an amazing day!
@RameyRants He looks kinda chubby, but I can't really tell.
That Raw wasn't really that bad.
Its a scorpion death drop. Its still real to me dammit.
Did JBL really just call it a stinger drop?
Hes waited 14 years? Fucker could have gone to the WWE whenever he wanted. @rameyrants
The first time Sting talks on tv its on the fucking network after Raw lol.
Sting doesn't talk lol.
Relax Cole, not one of the greatest moments in Raw history. Awesome, but relax.
@RameyRants I loved that he woooo'd.
So what about that exclusive interview with the "winner"?
Wooooo! Sting!
Cue Sting.
But its not like Orton spent the whole night laughing and talking about how he broke the Authority.
Kinda figured it was all a ruse.
@RameyRants I feel like Rollins is cashing in soon. Usually a guy gets buried before something bit happens. Everyone is against him now.
@RameyRants I'm surprised Sting is there this week. Figured they'd save it for next week.
UGH we almost made it through a whole show without Trips or Steph. Damn so close.
@RedDevilsGoalie Fucking R-Truth.
Who called who a turd? @rameyrants
