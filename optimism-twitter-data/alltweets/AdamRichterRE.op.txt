Don just gave the kid his Caddy and say at the bus stop. Maybe this is the last we'll see if him. #MadMenMonday
I loved how Don instinctively corrected the kid's grammar. #MadMenMonday
At least the kid has one fan. #MadMenMonday
Is this the end of Pete's story? He's moving to Kansas? #MadMenMonday
Pete will take the Learjet job, but he wants Trudy with him. #MadMenMonday
Don: "Do you really think I need your spare change?" Not a smart thing to say to his attackers but a damn good line. #MadMenMonday
The vets have come back because they think Don stole the collection jar. #MadMenMonday
@RichSchlam Joan from "Mad Men."
He stops just short of admitting he took his CO's identity. #MadMenMonday
Don: "I killed my CO." Here comes the confession. #MadMenMonday
His silence isn't working in this VFW hall. #MadMenMonday
The other Korea vet tries to get Don to talk. #MadMenMonday
In addition to being yanked, Duck may have tanked Pete's career. #MadMenMonday
And here comes Duck, loaded and in Pete's apartment. #MadMenMonday
One Korea vet meets Don and the hair on the back of both of our necks stands up. #MadMenMonday
It's funny to see Pete debate whether he should be ambitious. #MadMenMonday
Pete's dinner date is his brother, who apparently is going to have a date. #MadMenMonday
Don in a room with a bunch of VFW members. I wonder if his desertion wi come up. #MadMenMonday
Aaaand the Caddy is back. The motel owner wants Don to stay, bolstering my prediction. #MadMenMonday
Btw, there is one storyline I am not tweeting tonight. But it's not all Pete and hellish motel rooms. #MadMenMonday
It's nice to see Pete getting along with his ex-wife. #MadMenMonday
My prediction: Don takes over the motel and stays in Oklahoma. That's his punishment for all his sins on this show. #MadMenMonday
The maid is now hustling Don for the liquor. He's got moxie, that's for sure. #MadMenMonday
Duck is drunk and persistent. I'll give him that. #MadMenMonday
Don had to pay the maid to find some alcohol.  See? Hell. #MadMenMonday
I have to admit, I'm impressed with Pete's sales pitch to Learjet. #MadMenMonday
Don's stuck in a motel in Oklahoma. Or as I would call it, hell. #MadMenMonday
This does not look good for Betty. #MadMenMonday
Duck is desperate. He's drinking again and asking Pete for help. The latter is the real sign. #MadMenMonday
I guess Joan is gone. #MadMenMonday
Duck is back, to help them replace Don. #MadMenMonday
Glad to see that Don and Sally are talking again. #MadMenMonday
On a less profound note, I want Pete Campbell's jacket. #MadMenMonday
Was the traffic stop a dream? Don dreams about the cop saying 
"You knew we'd catch up with you eventually." #MadMenMonday
"Okie From Muskogee" is playing on Don's car radio. Classic. #MadMenMonday
Penultimate time! #MadMenMonday Turn away now because this will be #spoiler heavy.

Peggy breaks the news to Stan that she's going to McCann and he should, too. #MadMenMonday

Don finds out that Roger's girlfriend is his ex-wife's mother. #MadMenMonday

But she just explained it. What a powerful scene. #MadMenMonday
Stan doesn't understand Peggy's history with children, which goes back to the beginning of the show. #madMenMonday

That was a great, honest exchange between Don and Sally. Her scenes are always among the best. #MadMenMonday
"Anyone pays attention to either of you, and you just ooze everywhere." Sally to her dad.

Sally wants to say goodbye to Glen and instead has to leave a tear-filled message with his mother. #MadMenMonday
To be fair, Leisure Suit Larry is wearing a regular suit. #MadMenMonday

Don leaves but not before placing the guidebook on her bed. #MadMenMonday
The waitress explains her situation. She had two daughters. One is still around. #MadMenMonday
Can't you see I don't want anything? -- the hostility from the waitress is scary.  #MadMenMonday
It feels weird to say this but I'm actually happy for Stan. #MadMenMonday
Just to back up a bit: Megan called Don an aging liar but didn't mention that her mom stole all of his furniture. #MadMenMonday
For the record, I think what's-his-name should let his hair grow out. #MadMenMonday
Stan and Peggy are in the oddest love triangle ever. #MadMenMonday
Don just gave Megan $1 million so she can have "the life you deserve." It barely stems her anger. #MadMenMonday
Harry Crane tried doing damage control, but he's not the target of Megan's wrath now anyway. #MadMenMonday
Quite the flirtation between Peggy and the photographer. #MadMenMonday
"You don't get to stand in judgment of me." Said by Megan's mom but could have been said by anyone. #MadMenMonday
"I can't believe Don threw you away." Looks like Megan found a new agent. And a pig. #MadMenMonday
Megan's mom can't get enough of Roger. Has she not seen his mustache? #MadMenMonday
This awesome photographer is hitting on Stan. So that's two women who don't find him repulsive. #MadMenMonday

Stan: "I apologize that the models have so many teeth. I know you're not used to that." Roger doesn't get all the good lines. #MadMenMonday
Twenty minutes in, we haven't seen Don smoke once.  #MadMenMonday
The waitress and Don are starting to reflect the new reality of 1970s relationships: divorce and broken suburban dreams. #MadMenMonday
Don Draper, serial liar, has a way of cutting through everyone else's b.s.  #MadMenMonday
"It's three in the morning. You already know why you're here." - Don, to the waitress who showed up at his place.  #MadMenMonday

Don is back in the diner.  He is trying to explain himself to the waitress, She's not buying it. #MadMenMonday
Apparently Peggy now works with Grizzly Adams. #MadMenMonday
"I'm going to be your client. And I hate to tell you, but I'm very hard to please." Hee. #MadMenMonday

The further "Mad Men" lurches into the 1970s, the uglier the outfits get. Not a profound statement, but it had to be said. #MadMenMonday
The Topaz people seem scared off by L'eggs panty hose.  Who remembers those in the supermarket? #MadMenMonday

"Taking information rom the aggregate to the personalized is what big data is all about." -Nikhil Hunshikatti, Columbus Dispatch. #AMEast15
Great presentation by Dr. Nitesh Chawla about big data and audience engagements. 
That end is customer loyalty and retention. #AMEast15
Nitesh: "It all boils down to engagement." Good reminder: Data is just a means to an end. #AMEast15
One graphic in this big data presentation uses Walter White to represent old readers and Jesse Pinkman to represent young. Heh. #AMEast15
Nitesh: Look at what people on your site do. You have to know this before you can act. #AMEast15
You need to see where your audience is coming from: direct, search, referral. #AMEast15
Nitesh: Direct traffic is a sign of customer loyalty. #AMEast15
Four attributes of big data:
Variety
Veracity
Volume

#AMEast15
Nitesh: If Amazon can quantify consumer data, so can the Post. #AMEast15

Good morning, western Berks. #tw 
Day: Consumers want Someone to make sense of the world around them. Dismissing it as a generational quirk is dangerous. #AMEast15
It turns out, readers WANT investigative and insightful reporting. #AMEast15
Day: John Oliver proves what good storytelling and wit can do, with 14-minute YouTube video on the FCC. #AMEast15
"Good storytelling and smart perspective wins in a cluttered and confusing landscape." Day. #AMEast15
Subscription or ad-supported content? Day says consumers don't have a preference. #AMEast15
Day: They don't believe in this kleptocracy that we've been accusing them of. #AMEast15
For the first time, poll showed that consumers believe they should pay for good content. #AMEast15
Day: This isn't an unwillingness to pay. #AMEast15
Day: Your content isn't good enough. It was good enough when we had fewer choices. #AMEast15
Day: Millennials don't believe your core mission statement that says you are the definitive source of news. #AMEast15
Again, they're doing lots of sampling. #AMEast15
Day: Consumers under 40 use almost 2x as many news sources in a week as those over the age of 40. #AMEast15
Day: If credibility is an issue, content is the critical problem. #AMEast15
Day: But people don't go to news websites they don't trust. #AMEast15
Poll: The role of journalism as the fourth estate is not one that readers (explicitly, IMHO) care about. #AMEast15
Day: The alternative is worse. The alternative is not being on Facebook. #AMEast15
Day's response: They're sampling you. Key is to find a way to convert them to subscribers. #AMEast15
The problem: People who come to sites from Facebook aren't loyal and don't stick around. #AMEast15
Social media: you've got to give them enough so they engage with your property. #AMEast15
Don't give away all your content on Facebook. Make it a place where people interact with your brand. #AMEast15
Entry points are now all over the place. Facebook is that winning point right now. #AMEast15
Millennials will not wait for newspaper to land on the porch or wait for the evening news to find out what's going on. #AMEast15
Day: People don't believe they have to make an appointment for news anymore. #AMEast15
Day: People have different behaviors in news consumption, but newspapers are holding their own. #AMEast15
Facebook always beats newspapers as a source for information. "It even beats Grandma," Day says. BUT it's not a content creator. #AMEast15
Day: You know who uses Twitter. You all. You know who doesn’t use Twitter? Everyone else. #AMEast15
Good news: more 18 year-olds read newspapers than watch local news, according to Magid study. #AMEast15
Day: the newspaper readership graph is more even than the local TV news. Drop off isn’t nearly as sharp for those under 35. #AMEast15
Day is saying what I’ve often said: there is no magic age when suddenly non-newspaper readers suddenly become newspaper readers. #AMEast15
People still watch local TV news, for instance, but the fewest are people 18-35. #AMEast15
Day: Not everybody uses their smartphone for news. People under 40 mostly do, those over 40 mostly don’t. #AMEast15
Day: Magid did a big study of people 18-64: Millennials, Gen Xers and boomers. #AMEast15
Bill Day, from Frank Magid Associates, a research and consulting firm, is giving this presentation. #AMEast15

Bentley: Disaster stories tend to be among the most popular on @circa. #AMEast15
Example: The @circa MH370 story had 85 elements, with 2 breaking notifications and over 400 normal notifications. #AMEast15
Readers don't get push notifications for items in a story they've already read. #AMEast15
Readers can follow a story on @circa and get notified each time the story gets updated. #AMEast15
"This plays entirely into how we construct news stories." -- Bentley #AMEast15
Daniel Bentley from @circa is up next. The company's original focus was on mobile-first news consumption. #AMEast15
One recommendation: change story forms to conform to digital platforms. No more 50-inch stories on a small screen. #AMEast15
Engagement is higher, even with paywall, in apps than on mobile. What is your preference? App or mobile web? #AMEast15
One problem with responsive design is it isn't "engineering-responsive." Load times become slow and abandonment goes up.  #AMEast15
(I almost said people clicked on articles from home page. That would be a big #fail.) #AMEast15
People look at the home screen, and if they don't find content there, they leave. #AMEast15
Grey: in study of mobile users, most who visited articles did so from home. Only 6% used navigation. #AMEast15
Grey: McClatchy mobile web audience isn't as engaged as those who  use the apps. More than half of app users are subscribers. #AMEast15
Grey: Apps have a small audience, but it's an engaged audience.  #AMEast15
Grey Montgomery, McClatchy: Today more than half of McClatchy traffic comes from mobile. Saturday and Sunday are biggest days. #AMEast15
While we wait for the next #AMEast15 session to start, what did everyone think of the #WalkingDeadfinale?
Interesting: Day passes are rare among paid-content models for newspapers, but they seem to be going that way. #AMEast15
Steve @dorsey: Blendle in the Netherlands is experimenting with "the iTunes of newspapers."
Steve @dorsey: Make sure all groups are involved in the paid content discussion, including editorial. #AMEast15
@SaraLang I'm just gonna go ahead and mass favorite all the tweets in this rant.
NDInsider looking at changes to subscription strategy and content strategy. Important to review both, frequently. #AMEast15
What happened with NDInsider? Slight drop in page views, 1,000 subscribers in first year but raw, short videos were biggest hits. #AMEast15
NDInsider doesn't have a monthly subscription option: Pay annually or in four installments. #AMEast15
Ellis: Readers will pay if they feel they're getting something valuable. #AMEast15
Ellis: New pay model required relaunching the site all together. Had a four-month window to get it ready for football season. #AMEast15
Ellis: Charge for content that others are NOT producing. Exclusive columns, etc. #AMEast15
Many in digital sports world use "freemium" model: Some content is free, others is subscription-only. #AMEast15
NDInsider launched in 2011, a digital-only product. #AMEast15
Jennifer Ellis from South Bend Tribune talks about monetizing NDInsider. #AMEast15
5) Market to Google. Don't just rely on SEO. #AMEast15
Do some A/B testing. See what works and what doesn't. #AMEast15
3) Test the funnel: set goals in analytics and find out how you perform.  #AMEast15
2) Analytics: look at your numbers. If you don't know how, learn it. #AMEast15
Tips for best practices: 1) Consumer Marketing. Do as much as you can. Let customers know when a story will be locked. #AMEast15
Ad revenue fell, then started a slow climb back to come about even, Volcsko says. #AMEast15
Over 18 months, traffic went up for Calkins since the paid-content strategy went into effect. #AMEast15
It's important to find ways to add value to the paid product. #AMEast15
Strategic pricing and timing of free content are integral parts of Calkins' paid content strategy. #AMEast15
BTW, all the Calkins facts come from Jake Volcsko, their digital media director. #AMEast15
Other user behavior: tell readers to come back in a few days. Runs the risk of readers not coming back ever. #AMEast15
Meter model created a user behavior that Calkins didn't want. Users could game the system, for one thing. #AMEast15
Calkins Media didn't think they had to lose audience when they went to a paid model.
This isn't even the first burrito picture in this workshop. #AMEast15 #tw 
@dorsey thanks!
Moenetizing social audiences is tough. They aren't that loyal. Sorry, tweets and Facebookers. You just aren't. #AMEast15
On the plus side, digital subscriptions go up. But a paywall doesn't need to mean a loss of audience.  #AMEast15
When you launch a paywall, expect a dip in your online audience. In Uniontown, Calkins lost 40%. #AMEast15
Calkins Media, which owns newspapers and tv stations, has multiple paid-content models.  #AMEast15
Upcycling: A way to reuse existing content. Can be updated in a summarized, shorter-form way. #AMEast15
Steve @dorsey: if any one of us knew the right answer, we wouldn't be in this room. Truth. #AMEast15
Personalization of content is important, including with email newsletters. #AMEast15
Younger audiences willing to get email newsletters. #AMEast15
In Austin, bonus content is also created for subscribers. #AMEast15
Analytics are necessary to measure audience engagement. #AMEast15
Value plus use: Free access, but registration needed. Then there's full membership, which comes with paid subscription. #AMEast15
Steve Darsey: Goal should bet to get people engaged. Make them aware with free sites, free apps, social media, events. #AMEast15
Austin app, mobile sites and 
For most under 40, predominant thinking is that news should be accessible (free). #AMEast15
Steve Dorcy, from the Austin American-Statesman: two paid products: print edition and 
Big question: How do we monetize content we put out to our readers? #AMEast15
Next up: Revenue strategies. #AMEast15 
Other advice: Also think about your offline impact, how your stories affect people's lives, in ways that analytics don't measure. #AMEast15
Is that true? Do you go to a news site based on a email, or do you go to the homepage out of habit? Discuss. #AMEast15
Audience insight: “email is the new homepage.” This is especially true for mobile, and for rural communities. #AMEast15
Guy: Audiences will still watch “good-enough video”; it doesn’t have to be slick.  #AMEast15
Length is key: On mobile, most videos are ideally 30 seconds to 2 minutes long.  #AMEast15
Guy: mobile video will allow local media companies to think national plays/views, which they’ll have to do. #AMEast15
Trends in news video: Creation of ready-to-publish video directly for mobile. (Dror) #AMEast15
Stick with sponsorship models, at least in the beginning. #AMEast15
Tasaka: if anybody mentions cpm, you should run far away. Local media will never get the kind of traffic Buzzfeed, etc., do. #AMEast15
Good question: How to get this video approach to make money for news orgs? #AMEast15
This tech appears to allow newspapers to easily create tv news-style content. This raises a larger question: Should we? #AMEast15
Here is the website: 
Wochit creates storyboards and writes scripts based on the content that users upload.  It will also suggest video for your story. #AMEast15
That last quote was by Dror Ginzberg, co-founder of Wochit. #AMEast15
It starts with a story, but can bring in licensed video, inforgraphics. “All you have to do is put your creativity into it.” #AMEast15
Wochit allows anyone to create original video in minutes. (How is this different from YouTube, Instagram, Tout, etc.?) #AMEast15
Next up: A look at Wochit, a video-creation platform. #AMEast15
Guy Tasaka from Calkins: If we’re not on these platforms, we might not win in our coverage areas. #AMEast15
Why? This is where the audience is going. Also part of the paid-content strategy. #AMEast15
TV Everywhere app - video app with live streaming, shows, etc. #AMEast15
Some of Calkins’ shows are VOD, meaning users have to pay to watch episodes. That follows their paid-content model. #AMEast15
@StevenPSmith2 thanks!
Calkins has live video streaming available on OTT devices.
Internet-connected homes that get tv via Apple TV, Roku, etc., will pass 50% by 2016. #AMEast15
App went from category based system to “seamless” firehose system: Videos were just part of the stream, and views rose 900%. #AMEast15
But mobile video wasn’t going up until about 9 months ago, when Calkins started looking at its app structure. #AMEast15
Calkins media does daily news updates, sports shows and weekly special interest shows on video.  #AMEast15
Every day, more and more people are watching video on mobile devices. #AMEast15
Back in an #AMEast15 session. Fair warning: I will be live-tweeting this workshop about video.

The future is not in drones that you control. The future is in autonomous drones. - Christopher Vo. #AMEast15 
@tayswiftsgroom Technology has made some of those old concepts obsolete, though.
Among the proposed rules: licensed pilots, no flying over crowds, drones must be in pilot’s line of sight, etc. #AMEast15
Drone technology is great, but right now it’s illegal for news orgs to use them.  FAA is drafting rules though. #AMEast15
Flyaways can be a problem with autonomous drones. Key is proper calibration. #AMEast15
Every person who flies a drone for the first time crashes, but they’re all related to user error. #AMEast15
Christopher Vo talks about a homemade drone he built for $200.  #AMEast15 
Some ethical questions: Should just anyone be able to fly them? Who owns airspace? What about privacy? #AMEast15
Tech challenges: Still tedious and time-consuming to use drones (technical challenge). I hope we discuss ethical challenges too. #AMEast15
Drone innovation: a team used drones to help estimate damage and create maps to assist with relief after Philippines typhoon. #AMEast15
@DustinLeedLNP of course, having a drone speed toward you might not help your symptoms.
Drones can be used to help with 3-D modeling of maps. #AMEast15
German drone company made drone that delivers AED on demand to heart attack victims.  #AMEast15
Amazons is set to sell 1600 copies of one quad copter per day. No wonder FAA wants rules in place. #AMEast15
Quad copters in particular are effective for stills or video photography. #AMEast15
My next session has drones. Does your session have drones? #AMEast15 
Pigeons were the original drones. #AMEast15
“Every day we get to start over, so every day should be an experiment.” SHOULD be a universal newsroom maxim.  #AMEast15
