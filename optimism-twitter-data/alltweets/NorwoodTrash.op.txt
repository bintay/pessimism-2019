@NOELY1982 next time you see him ask Odin about when he met him...
@NOELY1982 if they're 'the best fans in the world' why do they need shearer to go round with freebies to get them in the ground?
@NOELY1982 ha! Spot on...
@NOELY1982 and 87.6% of stats are made up...
Its pretty criminal that Utd can have nigh on 140% possession over 2 games &amp; not have a single attempt on target!!
This is exactly the same performance as last year that got moyes the sack...
Well I didn't expect that to work that quickly!
Mata's having a stinker, di Maria on for him, Young to the right...

@NOELY1982 I'm sure I read somewhere he cant contractually commentate in the windies for sky. May be wrong though
@NOELY1982 @McFc_Kieran now we'll see what city are made of! (its 2028 on my game!!) 

@Swannyg66 @Aggerscricket even cooler than warren hegg?

@ChukaUmunna @Ed_Miliband why do we? We never have since the start of international banking?!
England/Britain has been in debt since international banking began, why are people arsed now?!
@NOELY1982 who?
@SouthernRailUK I know you are, Joe kept telling me last week. Why aren't you doing anything about it?
@SouthernRailUK so you're just ignoring the fact that the info boards at gipsy hill are out?! And have been for over a week?!
@iainlee they all have agents. Bizarre isn't it?!
@SouthernRailUK a clean sweep! A whole working week with no info boards at gipsy hill!
@SouthernRailUK 3rd straight day with no departure boards at gipsy hill...
@JohnCampbell610 @louderthanwar check out the pic of john squire on louder than war...
@SouthernRailUK presume there's a reason the displays aren't working at gipsy hill for the 2nd day in a row?

@NOELY1982 we'll discuss this further over the weekend. Asda have just delivered 27 bottles of ale off Emmas mum &amp; I'm diving in!
@NOELY1982 @The_FSF then they should publicise it! Its easy enough to buy a club's season ticket list &amp; send out emails
@NOELY1982 @The_FSF for why?
@The_FSF chances are the prem match will be on tv (somehow). The premier league laugh at such protests. Needs proper action...
Here's an idea @The_FSF organise a mass boycott. Get everyone to go to their local non league next season.
@campbellclaret wouldn't want to be the guy who mopped the floor under burley after 'dave' had finished...

Hard to recall a more abject England wc performance. 99 &amp; 96? At least they were competitive in those...

@tomhingleymusic @NOELY1982 after the carter gig the other year, politeness itself you were despite me drunkenly rambling at you! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@tomhingleymusic @NOELY1982 I wouldn't have a word said against you Tom! Was only a vague physical resemblance he had. Met you at Jamm
@tomhingleymusic @NOELY1982 nah, this guy was something special!
@tomhingleymusic @NOELY1982 he didn't sadly, his general knowledge let him down...
@tomhingleymusic @NOELY1982 lad on the lottery show the other night reminded me of you a bit...
@NOELY1982 no, he was the spit of tom hingley from Inspiral carpets
Nobody mentions the united fans were sat on bill shankley's face?
Keown only picked Rooney &amp; Davies for motm as there the only ones he's heard of...

David Beckham being a Preston great is the same as henrik Larsson being a united great!
@JohnCampbell610 to be fair, anyone who tears their anus making a tackle deserves at least1 vote...
@GaryLineker can you ask the commentators how much di Maria cost please? Think we should know... #motd
@bglendenning @BarcaJim I agree with you, but the cleverley that came back from that injury wasn't the same for whatever reason..
@bglendenning @BarcaJim just so you know I'm not apportioning any blame to big kev for cleverley's fortunes since
@bglendenning @BarcaJim seriously! Check out cleverleys career before &amp; after that tackle, its startling!
@BarcaJim @bglendenning @Kevin__Davies tom cleverley &amp; his career never recovered...

@terrychristian Steve Bruce had left by the time of the 6-3

@RobPollard_ really?! At least it isn't sack again.
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s certainly did in the 89 version. Ran from his area &amp; scored
Glenn hoddle: ' I wouldn't go for a striker as captain'. Alan Shearer...
@NOELY1982 not saying they're shit mind but come on...
@NOELY1982 world class?
Who are these 2 'world class' midfielders that have just retired from England of which Adrian chiles speaks?!
Paul Parker not holding back: describes Hernandez as 'a Mexican Tony Cottee'!      Ouch!!

@JohnCampbell610 bought him from stoke for 1m!
@JohnCampbell610 just looked at the report of that game.  Walsh aside the rest of the line up shouldn't have lost 4-0!
@JohnCampbell610 Cambridge away in the league cup for wilko. Rachubka, Amos...
@JohnCampbell610 fair dos. And goalies! Shit at bringing goalies through as well
@JohnCampbell610 previous strikers who came through the ranks, robins &amp; Hughes. That's it unless you go back to the 50s...
'I go steady &amp; French kiss.' So, everyone does! 'Yeah but my dad says I'm the best!' #nationallampoonvacation
@SouthernRailUK you might want to check out the ticket machines at gipsy hill. Nearly always out of action, one way or another these days.
@lukeymoore 'I took some pot and I was briefly mindless... '
@football_oranje @dazjenno lovely player but a gobshite for cash
@GrantRoberts_91 fair enough.
@TheK1lla1 fair dos.
Why don't Sheffield Wednesday put away fans in the lower tier of the leppings lane? Looks ridiculously empty...
Can you imagine a work permit problem holding up a signing under Fergie?! Even Tim Howard found a snide Hungarian passport from somewhere!
@yolkie_ of course! A complacent rot was allowed to set in post the sale of Ronaldo. You don't think everything was cool until moyes do you?
@yolkie_ and the one before that?
Sean Dyche is very much the low grade David Brent of the premier league. Rogers remains the high watermark though...
@dazjenno the way he barked at de Gea for not coming out when it was his ball to defend was disgraceful
Ah marvellous! Scouse puppet sammy lee is back! How the fuck did he end up with koeman though?!
That finish from routledge for Swansea is one of the best I've ever seen!
@Randy_Rann @sevenocricket big bash next week?
Hey America, how's the Tim Howard stops everything thing going?
Agent Diouf doing the business there I see...
@flintoff11 can you bring it round to my dads house for his 65th in October in Manchester?
Not panicking yet. We've won the league from worse positions after 3 games. Remember john o'shea as centre forward in 07-08?
@DFletcherSport I thought you were quite solid in midfield though...
@dazjenno to be honest you're not buying from the top shelf when you buy from Wigan, with all respect to them...
@dazjenno I thought it was very generous to give him player of the year that season. It was almost a sympathy vote...
@dazjenno I always picture him with a massive wheely suitcase. With his lunch in it...
@dazjenno to be fair it used to work... That one time v Blackburn!
People called for Evans to be captain! Shirking his responsibility &amp; blaming de Gea for not coming out was pitiful from him!
@dazjenno irwin was very capable of the spectacular. Loved a free kick
@martinkelner @BBCLeeds #accountantsfilmclub Paris, Taxes
@johnjmoloney he's supposed to be a Manc yet sounds like dick van dyke doesn't he?
@JonnyGabriel @sidlowe #JusticeForAdrianDurham nicky butt?
@JohnCampbell610 the frank skinner middle aged man run/walk action...
@JamesHReeve Swales out!!
@TuftyMUFC are you fucking mental?!
@PostItPlayers Ricky Ponting?
@mrTonyLaw @noelfielding11 is that Gazza?
Balls!! @LancsCCC
@HSBC_UK_Help thanks for getting back. needed to withdraw cash above the daily limit from the machine.
@HSBC_UK_Help any idea why your Brixton, beckenham &amp; catford branches are closed today when advertised online as open on Saturdays?
Jade Derbach is the Tom Cleverley of cricket. They're shite but somehow keep getting picked! #T20Blast
@LancsCCC @Stevenjcroft let's hope he gets to 102 today! #ohlankylanky!
What does 'WASP' stand for? #T20FinalsDay
Confused as to who the 'united insider' was who claimed that Welbeck has 'an astonishing strike rate...' For who?!            
#Welbeck


@FootballCliches is that not a typo &amp; should read 'barter'? Makes more sense...
@JohnCampbell610 think of all those games where Suarez didn't bite someone...
Anybody who uses the term 'there is a disconnect...' is a cunt...
For this ice bucket challenge thing I nominate Matthew Simmons &amp; Brian Hill (Kettering)...
Why would you ever tuck a jumper into jeans?! 
@RedMancunian has de Gea just asked him how fat could he be if he actually tried?
@dazjenno are they jabbering on about how they once got the wrong type of cheese with their ocado delivery &amp; life was never the same?!
@dazjenno ever since Diana died we've turned into a nation if grief junkies. Competing to show who can be more upset about anything!
@NOELY1982 is he in your 25 this season?
Sweetchuck from police academy 
University challenge guy  
Sweetchuck from police academy is on #universitychallenge
Jesus!! @LancsCCC don't make things easy!!
@lukeymoore @andybrassell Kat Symons
Today's The Day Today headline: 'Ryan Giggs' dad attacked by angry baboons whilst filming them' (c) Sunday Mirror
Why are hibs wearing their away kit v hearts?!
And then he found a job
And heaven knows he's miserable now. 
Scholes: 'get the ball to the wide men &amp; I'm sure they'll be ok'. Somewhere David Moyes' bottom lip trembles...
Oh fucking hell!!
And the last of my current top 3 is the marvellous Aloe Heat Lotion!

@SouthernRailUK pair of black specs left on the 1700 to beckenham junc. Handed in at gipsy hill station. Can you RT?

@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 @McFc_Kieran @HenshawKiran @FootballManager ah. Fair dos then
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 @McFc_Kieran @HenshawKiran @FootballManager scumbag! That 72m is the council's!!
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 the nme who thought George Harrison was the bass player in the Beatles...
@OldSchoolFooty John Connelly
@NOELY1982 brilliant
@SimplyARed @Shawldini fair dos, your point is valid. Players move on, not everyone can be a giggs...
@Shawldini @SimplyARed law didn't put in a tr, doc sold him w/o his knowledge, didn't celebrate when he scored &amp; it didn't relegate us.
@JohnCampbell610 he's really going to have to pull his tripe out now!
@JohnCampbell610 release clause!
@JohnCampbell610 he was named in the WC best team. I'm always wary of utd signing players of the back of a good tournament though...
@JohnCampbell610 well this Rojo deal looks a goer &amp; Blind. Just what we need really
@JohnCampbell610 the only other guaranteed starter who'd be a candidate would be Evans
@JohnCampbell610 he's going to be 1st choice till Xmas at least so good call...
@JohnCampbell610 at least 11 (inc tonight) off the top of my head
@JohnCampbell610 spawny gets! Should at least have had a 1 off replay in the nou camp!
@NOELY1982 well you learn summat new every day!
@NOELY1982 is it? I thought it was made at the buckfast abbey
@NOELY1982 do you get much buck fast down here?
That list of famous names who want Scotland to stay in the uk? If that doesn't boost the #Yes vote nothing will! Sarpong? Akabusi?
@PeteBoyle70 @CJL_wherever brilliant!
@NOELY1982 @CityScott76 are you going to babysit the night before the qpr game in November?
@NOELY1982 @CityScott76 not with that attitude! This weekend?
Brendan Rogers says that van Gaal will struggle as he's not managed in a league as good as the prem before?! Did he really say that?
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ ha! Excellent stuff!
@JohnCampbell610 she could be shouting '.....' No, can't think of anything...
@lukeymoore apples &amp; bananas that comparison
@lukeymoore absolutely top drawer stuff! Anyone who doesn't like it frankly has no soul!
If Alex Salmond was serious about the Scottish independence debate he'd have just got napoleon dynamite out to do a skit...
@JohnCampbell610 has he still got his daughter's fluffy horse or whatever it was?
Well, this is all very encouraging...
I hope the ref responded to glen johnson's foul mouthed tirade there with 'I'm just as god made me sir'!
Sweet!
Tyler Blackett reminds me of Zeki Fryers. There! I said it!
Decent finish that...
What is a 'marquee signing'? A marquee is a big tent! Why would you want to sign a massive load of canvas?!
@JohnCampbell610 some marquee punditry?
@JohnCampbell610 you're not wrong! Bet he never had a snide nus in his pocket!
Just found this bastard squatting on my shower screen!! 
@JohnCampbell610 this is the 1st time I've seen Shaw for utd. Looks like he's been on the lash since the WC!
Poor defending there...
'What do you #playfor?' asks the advertising board. 'Big sacks of cash' think the players....
@JohnCampbell610 
@JohnCampbell610 it was for the war...
@JohnCampbell610 I thought it was my eyes!!
@JohnCampbell610 it's a proper big searchlight, like the batman sign, but they forgot to put the bat shape on the lamp!
Anyone know what the big searchlight is, looks like it's going up from the #Streatham area?
@NOELY1982 watching Kyle?
They're saying this is the best commonwealth games. Balls! Manchester was better! Free johnnies from Owens park for all! Still got mine!
@LukeHaines_News the cold dead eyes of a careerist shark on him has that des Clarke

@Randy_Rann @Harxy no watching 'swingers' late into the night this year!
@Randy_Rann @sevenocricket @robholdsworth @dompapineau @shanevansanden @mendonca_wilson @Miss0070 have a good one boys! Up the O!
@VictoriaPeckham @LesRosbifs @thetimes would it not have been more honest if the story said 'Bolt in a bad mood'?
You'd have thought after nigh on 20 years in Corrie the actor playing David platt would've dropped at least some of his Leeds accent...
@andypeters10 @terrychristian that isn't answering my question....
@andypeters10 @terrychristian if there were 3000 rocket attacks why haven't many more Israelis died? What are Hamas aiming at?!
@AntiqueFootball those nets are immense! I'm guessing the ground doubled as a velodrome...
@RobPollard_ I saw this &amp; thought, 'the sun always shines/on tv'!
Marvellous morning spent watching highlights of all the games on the 90/91 CWC run. Lots of memories flooding back! #bringbacktheCWC
@PatricksbarSE19 that's shit news!! Only decent place in palace to watch the football!
The lesser spotted away goalie top. Used once I believe v Legia in 91... 
@AntiqueFootball I've never heard of this! Amazing!
If only Morrissey had watched this episode of Scarma's History of Britain,Irish blood English heart wouldn't have been such a lyrical mess..
@NOELY1982 just trying to lighten the mood...
@dazjenno @yolkie_ might hold you to that! :-)
@NOELY1982 they should hire him after his goal v Uruguay!
@NOELY1982 @McFc_Kieran @JohnCampbell610 rungtatsamee will be there!
@dazjenno @yolkie_ Bebe?
@McFc_Kieran @NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 I have no idea! It's at the apple store on regent st. And it's free!
@yolkie_ @dazjenno gah!
@jamesofwalsh @guardian I've got the ruffle from mozzers shirt from a Blackburn gig in 02. Vacuum packed so it smells of him still!
@dazjenno Danny higginbottom?
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 might restart my fiorentina game!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 clean &amp; serene for a while now. Kitty's at nursery from tomorrow &amp; I'm off work till Monday week...
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 I'm going to be the only person there who can't see through his right hand when held up to the light!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 did you get my message about me going to the Football Manager fan night?
How shit are Hamas at firing rockets? Apparently fired loads, killing so few. Israel meanwhile can kill shitloads of people easily...
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 he's a miserable twat though. Just enjoy the match for fucks sake!
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 is that the Jonathan Wilson book?

@NOELY1982 the fraudster!!
@NOELY1982 I know! Gutted!! I've still got the programme...
One of the big regrets of my life, not going to the 2002 commonwealth games ceremony!
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 and keys bigging up Ipswich v Wimbledon as part of 'the best league in the world'!!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 it's impossible to stop watching an episode of the premiership years! Even though you know what happens!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 although as Noel says, neither are great!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 seahorses! Monaco had a few ok songs on a not bad album. Seahorses' album was offensively awful!
How come the England cricket team have nearly all turned into dicks having been likeable not so long ago?!
Fancy joining the likes of Cheryl Cole, Victoria... 
'Summer breeze, makes me feel hi-iigh' no, it's more likely the weed isn't it?!
@NOELY1982 having a romantic night in Paris the other night. What did we do? That's right! We watched the weekenders on YouTube!!!
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ October it is then?
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ would that Friday (7th?) not be the smiths night?
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ when's city at qpr? Yes sounds good certainly for the away(home?!) leg!
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ we should organise a night out at one. October/November or around that...
@NOELY1982 are the smiths nights still going? The star was shut last time we were up...
@NOELY1982 and... drummer &amp; singer aside they all have great hair!!
@NOELY1982 this is just before they forgot how to right songs. Ok computers a great album, forget what you think &amp; give it a listen...
@NOELY1982 paranoid androids pretty great though...
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 willing to have my mind changed! It'd actually be nice to get back enjoying the moz as it goes!
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 actually Rob, I'm going to listen to it now, willing to change my mind!
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 agree with you on those, IBEH, 1st of the gang, let me kiss you, the rest are a bit hmm...
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ I remember being at a smiths night with Franny around 98 &amp; only 10 people being there...
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 not shit exactly, just not as good as the euphoria at the time suggested.
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ it wasn't much different to maladjusted. You're right, just the fact it happened got it ace reviews...
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ bbc4 now!
@RobPollard_ @NOELY1982 I hope so. Thought years of refusal was ace, ringleaders ok &amp; quarry pretty shit, a few songs aside...
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ anyway Noel, I've seen Morrissey many more times than you! I'm allowed to criticise every now &amp; then...
@NOELY1982 @RobPollard_ to be fair, I've not had a proper listen yet. I'll still buy it as I have all the others...
@RobPollard_ it was either uncut or q who did a good piece about that tour &amp; how nuts it was. None of the band could believe it!
@RobPollard_ is that the Dallas one?

@DaftLimmy wank 2: the revenge
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 why would I?
@RobPollard_ definitely did in the late 70s
@RobPollard_ weren't the shorts sky blue between 05-07?
@JohnCampbell610 they must have someone in the reserves as back up? Can't see them spending on another one. Who is the reserves LB?
@JohnCampbell610 I bet Buttners regretting his move now! He'd definitely be 1st choice after all his mom performances last season!
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews I agree with you there about labour letting it happen too
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews target
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews then close the loopholes. It's pretty simple. The govt have ideologically aimed austerity in the wrong
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews why should it? I thought 'we were all in this together'?! You've swallowed the false economics...
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews it doesn't need to save money, it needs to raise it. Bring back 50% tax &amp; clamp down on tax avoidance
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews which has been raided to pay for a crisis they didn't cause. pay has decreased in real terms since 2010
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews will they? Why are so many teachers quitting then? Why should they stay on to be treated like dirt?
@Elliott_Malik @bbc5live @BBCNews so when they can't afford to teach you &amp; leave what are you going to do? Moan about 1 day?
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 what he doesn't know is that ed woodwards in that mickey suit!

@dazjenno wonder who he was praying to at the end?!
@UtdRantcast actually I can't speak for the commentator, he probably does still think that IS the proper anthem...
Who was Luiz praying to at the end? Can't be to the same god as he was at kick off?
@UtdRantcast to be fair it is what they were singing, he wasn't referring to the title of the anthem
This is the wurst Brazilian team I've ever seen!! #Bra v #Ger

I notice Rio doesn't mind watching videos of Jagielka now...
@RobPollard_ there was talk of united going for him in 2011 &amp; reds scoffed. With rio &amp; vidic gone I wouldn't say no now...
@JohnCampbell610 I have to nip this Gary Mabbutt talk in the bud! Could escalate &amp; get out of hand!!
Can't believe I mentioned gary Mabbutt in my 2000th tweet!!
Gary Mabbutt looks exactly the same as the day he retired!!
@juvefcdotcom @LesRosbifs @themichaelowen to be fair I don't think Owen played with Pirlo but still bullshit of the highest order!
@JohnnyTheNic Gerrard of course. Waste of space for 2 games...
It's redemption for Suarez...
@JohnCampbell610 is he?! Furthermore why would anyone ask him?!
@FledglingsBook @deiniol9 fastest ever united red card was him (can't remember if that still stands)
@JohnCampbell610 fell out of love with playing &amp; didn't want to carry on stealing a living...
@FledglingsBook @deiniol9 Liam O'Brien in the no.8 top? I'd forgot all about him...
@JohnCampbell610 well money's too tight to mention under the glazers so what harm can it do?!
@RobPollard_ he's a good luck charm!
Who the fuck eats a Mars bar like that?!
Seedorf needs to fire out a Clay Davis. 'Shhhhheeeeeiiiiitttt!' before this tournaments out...

Copper 1208 needs to go back to police school. Reckons he can do what he wants to apprehend someone?! State approved techniques? #Coppers
on the 1 hand the UAF are the type of people who go to Glastonbury but when it comes to it you'll get a kicking if you go into 'em? #Coppers
These police are certainly nailing their colours to the #EDL mast in this C4 doc #Coppers
Outrageous that Pellegrini wasn't in the running for manager of the year! A league,a cup clearly isn't as worthy as finishing 2nd with nowt!

@dazjenno remember Eubank walking round OT at half time before his 2nd bout with Benn! He wished he was Cantona that night !
Steph Houghton of City Ladies: 'you can't just go in &amp; throw loads of money at it.' Want to talk to your bosses about that?!

Jesus!! Well Jose, it's up to you to do the right thing now!! (Little bit of sick in my mouth there...)
As if clattenburg would send a vermin off or give city a nailed on pen on today of all days!
@dazjenno anyway on a serious point moyes has to go! He's managed to turn OT into a civil war battlefield in less than a year!
@dazjenno @Everton true &amp; I'm not a moyes advocate at all but it's ok for Martinez to say that when they've just finished 6th not 15th...
@Everton @dazjenno different times though. When moyes went there, keeping Everton up was a big achievement given the mess they were in...
@yolkie_  and he's spent 39 of those appearances running 5 yards, stopping &amp; looking backwards! Useless twunt!
I like the way Eddie Howe always looks like he's just dropped his guts &amp; is willing to blame it on the interviewer once the camera stops...

@VicW1978 @NOELY1982 it's about a 15/20 min walk from OT. And i think he got off. There were bullet holes in the windows though
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 it's worth going into for the laugh of the glazers having to cancel the American tour!

@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 eek heard lescott to united is a done deal!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 he's been going to Munich for 2 years. I'd take dzecko to be honest. He'd get 30 goals at united
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 indeed. Fergie probably had it right. It's not as if he tearing up trees on the pitch...
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 it's not 40 mil saved though because we'd have to spend that on a new striker... It evens out...
@NOELY1982 the year before he was playing for united &amp; definitely wasn't earning 300k a week!
@NOELY1982 I agree. I've no idea why united went so high. The tubby funster could only go to Chelsea!!
@NOELY1982 do you think Rooney's pre take home is 600000 a week?? I'll refer you to tevez's payslip. Freely available on google...

@Randy_Rann @sevenocricket what you like at flying a jumbo jet?
@NOELY1982 @Joey7Barton didn't think it through did I?!
@Randy_Rann @sevenocricket sounds good to me! Pick up at morden?
@NOELY1982 @Joey7Barton fair point well made
@Joey7Barton the worst side? Probably not. Worst 'team' easily...
@Randy_Rann @sevenocricket the groundsmens gonna have his work cut out to get ready for august! #fulltossahoy!
@David_Lavery excellent stuff!! I've definitely mellowed with age!!
@UtdRantcast Tom cleverley woah woah/he makes a sideways pass/he thinks he's fabregas...
Last RT poor sod!
@MyToffees 
@SouthernRailUK 0931 gipsy hill to west Croydon running?
@JohnCampbell610 I've had a drink admittedly but it's just odd enough to happen!
Prediction: a very angry united to win 3-1 out of nowhere! Mata with 2 &amp; van Persie...
@prodnose no mention of the smiths old chap?
@FootyFunFacts @BizarreTransfer nothing to do with Liverpool. He was at Huddersfield!! How is this bullshit still going round??!!
@NOELY1982 Did you see the doc last week about the lads hunting gays? One said a (straight) teacher was a perv cos she smiled too much!!
A country run by Putin is hardly going to be party central is it?! #Sochi2014
The IOC guy complaining that #Sochi2014 has no 'joy or enthusiasm'. You gave it to Russia! The most joyless &amp; unenthusiastic country going!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s comparing apples &amp; oranges. Both top goals. Hughes' certainly less conventional than a cross &amp; header...
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s wasn't that for bishops goal? Oldfield got the 1st &amp; 4th
@FootballInT80s David oldfield
@mrmarksteel I work there. Having a cig outside the office when a young lad walked up &amp; had a dump on doorstep. It was 11am...
@barneyrednews to be honest he'd add more firepower to the current lot!!
Now then...
Fred the red standing at the end if the line for the minutes silence really cheapens it! What purpose does he serve there??!!
@UtdRantcast and a hairline!!
@UtdRantcast I took my dad to that as it was his birthday!
Why has there never been a gay/lesbian version of #takemeout ?
@JohnCampbell610 I hope not!
@richardosman @BBCiPlayer pemberton much underrated for his writing on benidorm too
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s @HenshawKiran that's the one!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s @HenshawKiran went off too soon didn't i?!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s @HenshawKiran same as Kents kit when I was there except ours was a yellow bukta Brighton away one...
@FootballInT80s joe Kinnear?
In cricket terms when did. 'On his debut' become 'on deboo'?! This is a new thing isn't it?!
@TypicalCity @NOELY1982 you're right though. Idiotic piece of 'reporting'!
Probably best for Kris akabusi to give the Winter Olympics &amp; World Cup a swerve...
@TypicalCity @NOELY1982 it was a twin peaks gag...
Bloody hell! Only in Russia could be castigated for being gay (even though you're not!) just for smiling all the time!! #Hunted
@NOELY1982 @TypicalCity was it a slightly surreal piece?

That's bollocks he didn't manage Liverpool till 1959
@RetroFootyBoot @FourFourTweet I had these in cherry &amp; white. Sold them cos they were shite! Like playing in kids slippers!!
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 he's only 24???!!!
@David_Cameron yet you're happy to compromise the safety of said millions of Londoners on the tube? Interesting logic...
@UtdBeforeFergie @3in1Football #blueadidas80 #mufc
@kmflett definitely time to adjourn then!
(via @mrfavus)
@NOELY1982 @MartinRossiter no. It's just an ace gig he did in Kensington the other year...
I have no recollection of buying it, but it's signed in gold pen...
In bed on my own watching @MartinRossiter live from bush hall... Makes sense...
@_4thOfficial and the coke presumably
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 coked off his box an'all!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 a cunt no one would lick! Not even toksvig !
@NOELY1982 like a Henry with cancer
Anyone that uses the phrase. 'Rock up', please kill yourselves... As painfully as possible,,,
This Leigh griffiths chap who's signed for Celtic... Which park did they get him off?!
It's quite sad listening to Barry Davies commentating on the jump! He put more into big trains staring contest!
@McFc_Kieran do it!!
@McFc_Kieran why aren't you outside keeping Fraser Deingthon company?
@McFc_Kieran @SkySportsNews it's like hitchcock's the birds!
@UtdBeforeFergie the bbc had a policy (esp mihir Bose) of saying this in case it went tits up &amp; they wouldn't look daft! That worked well!
@FergieGumSite good! Townsend is shit!!
@TypicalCity giddy
@UtdRantcast was that from your brief stint in the wonder stuff?
@aniketmazumdar @UtdRantcast 1 goal this season... From an overhit cross!! No assists either...
@FootballInT80s 'so Kenny, you know in Germany, racism is frowned upon these days ja?!'
@FledglingsBook @ChrisCasper1 who's the keeper there?
@JohnCampbell610 don't we all old chap!
That's liquid set piece football!
@ParkRed read by piece about him on fergie'

@FootballInT80s ralphie baby!
@3in1Football @UtdBeforeFergie 1st proper united top I got. (Off my city fan brother!)
@FootballInT80s definitely mark ellis
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s remember that horse racing game we had?!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s we must've got through some electric playing that!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s never did end up doing the double though #thedouble
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s billy tunks! Star goalie &amp; you could pick up tony Daley for 17 grand!
@NOELY1982 @FootballInT80s id love to find that!!
@dotunadebayo he's still ace though!
@dotunadebayo an account to get him to speak up! Far to quiet that man!
@NOELY1982 @RealTimBooth and upstairs are making a very loud go of coitus which is disconcerting...
@NOELY1982 @RealTimBooth I haven't to be honest. Just up with Kitty listening to a lot of James
@RealTimBooth fancy singing at our wedding in Florence on May 18th? Long shot admittedly...
@unitedrant as Neil young said 'it's better to burn out than to fade away ,,,'
@FootballCliches lock up your daughters
@NOELY1982 @VicW1978 oh don't worry 'into the valley' is on the play list an'all...
@NOELY1982 there's going to be lots of suede
@NOELY1982 twat! Gonna have to have some terrorvision at the wedding now!! I'd forgot about them !!
@NOELY1982 good bit of terrorvision!!
@PeteBoyle70 @NOELY1982 with giggsy on the wing, ole solskjaer made us sing...
@NOELY1982 is he on twitter?
@NOELY1982 it isn't
@AlwynPayne Londoners who say 'the' whatever road! No one says 'the' Wilmslow road do they?!
@NOELY1982 pool death funny man
@TfLOfficial how can you improve customer service on the tube by taking away the customer service staff?! Makes no sense!
@GNev2 @OllieHolt22 woodpecker?! #HouseOfFools
Can anyone explain why just lookin' &amp; bullet comes aren't on the @thecharlatans singles album? Or do I just have a duff copy? (iTunes)
Fuck me does De Gea owe big now!!!
Looks like I picked a bad week to give up sniffing glue...
@NOELY1982 bit of a twatty thing to say...
“@BarackObama: This is cause for celebration: 
@JohnCampbell610 yes. I can smell this going to pens... Or o'shea with a last minute winner!!
@NOELY1982 weak
Has Gus Poyet really got a monogrammed snood on?! The dick!!
Does anyone else think Rafael is getting a bit errrrr Anderson shaped or us it just my telly?
Wish they'd stop BWIN with that 'play for real' board! It'll give de Gea &amp; januzaj ideas!!
@ManUtdFF a fucking hammer hopefully! Shame it missed!!
How badly do refs &amp; @SkySports want to fuck Jose mourinho?!
@lukeymoore bollocks
If theres a worse ref in the country than phil dowd I've yet to see him!
@FergieGumSite I'll have something up tomorrow night after 3pts todayall going to plan. Need to get back into it!
@UtdRantcast if united's season could be described through a smiths song #Rantcast
@jamesofwalsh It's  a rite of passage for any new streathamite believe me!! Bus 109 or 250 back to streatham high rd
Well done irons! 6-0 down but kids for £1 (if accompanied by a mug paying £42!!) 
@standardnews this is clearly made up!! Not the story the quotes!! 
@mikelegend @F365 yellow card offence. Collymore &amp; Andy Morison got 2nd yellows in a city Fulham game in 99! Ungentlemanly conduct...
@barrymillard58 @UtdBeforeFergie Fran o Farrell?
@MichaelVaughan could do with more technical staff with that squad...
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 i thought his favourite boy band were blue? Who was more 'street' 5 or blue?
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 if he changes his squad number the '5' element to his clothes range becomes obsolete
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 his '5' range of clobber
@jamesofwalsh did they have a guess the beer, cheese &amp; chocolate tasting round? They used to in there...
'Lord Palmerston!!' Great episode of the Simpsons on now!
@NOELY1982 yep
@unitedrant Swansea only had the possession in their own half

- Negredo: 19 games - 8 goals  
- Welbeck: 15 games - 8 goals
@NOELY1982 down boy!?
@mrjimBob very Suede
@MichaelVaughan if it doesn't rise blame KP
@NOELY1982 especially when the overground &amp; bus services are so good down here! Idiots the lot of 'em!
@lukeymoore pretty girls make graves??!! There's a blast from the past! This is our emergency is a tune!
@ConorMcNamaraIE Valencia asked for the no.25 back as he didn't want the 7 anymore due to him being superstitious...
@MUFC_FAMILY looks like jay z!
@UtdRantcast luckily this might mean he's dropped for a bit!
@guardian_sport @guardian the players can fuck off &amp; start looking at themselves then!
@FootballInT80s mark walters
City proving that they're as good as Oldham circa 1990 by beating west ham 6-0 at home in the 1st leg of a league cup semi....
@AlwynPayne 'you don't win friends with salad! Oi!'
@JohnCampbell610 he'd be handy to 'break on through v the other side'! (If he wasn't Scottish!!)
@NOELY1982 Is your present from Kitty on it yet?
@NOELY1982 soz! I thought you might of heard by now!! Wait till you see peter Reid going in with her off of babecast!!
@NOELY1982 I'd say evander Holyfield might be the biggest! Can't wait for Davison to do chalky white for him!
@90sPlayers Gary pallister
I bet Cristiano Ronaldo shat himself when he woke up &amp; heard Portugal's greatest ever player had died!
@Randy_Rann let us never speak of this series again!!
@FootballInT80s was he not playing for Coventry before forest?
Perry from diversity is 18?! Fuck off mate they're not selling fireworks!! #splash
Enjoying Ledley kings tie knot. Resolutely 2003!!
Little tip for santi cazorla, if you must kiss your tattoo when you score maybe have it in a less awkward place...
@FootballInT80s Ian bogie?
@OliverKayTimes Fabio a perfectly good alternative, played in a European cup final, not good enough now apparently!
Since no one else will say it can I put forward the case for Kagawa being fucking shit?
Lot of love betwixt evra &amp; Adebayor there. Presumably from their Monaco days...,
Oh good Michael Owen is co-commentator. I feel more informed already!
In the pub, footy on 3 screens, Big on the other. Everyone turns round for the dancing on piano scene &amp; hums along to chopsticks!
@Higginbotham05 @FootballGib altrincham?
Oh Ole! Don't do it! Seriously! That way madness lies! #solskjaer
Glenn miller story on C5. Do you think it'll explain why he was killed by a pimp in a brothel in pigalle in Paris?
@FootballRamble Bony's goal was perfectly legitimate. Not his fault people don't know the laws...
How can Saunders &amp; smith persist in saying it was offside despite being shown it a hundred times?!
It never ceases to amaze me that @SkySports employ pundits who clearly don't know the laws of football!
@ManUtdFF very much the Anderson of the refs world then...
@ManUtdFF how does he keep passing the refs fitness test each year?! He's clearly out of shape! And a twat!
@alkapranos golden fry opposite gipsy hill station...
What time is too early to go to the pub today?
@Randy_Rann @Harxy @jamesofwalsh @moseleythecow @sevenocricket all the best for 14 chaps! Have a good one tonight!
@David_Lavery pub?
@babbelquack @FootballInT80s you might be right. Good shout!
I trust rizzle kicks get the irony of calling a song 'let's skip to the good bit' that is entirely shit...
@FootballInT80s Eric Nixon only man to play in all 4 divisions in 1 season
@Harxy @Randy_Rann @moseleythecow @jamesofwalsh I'm awake. Trying to put a moody baby to bed. Up for lols!!!
@ColinMurray the one at the channel tunnel sells condoms &amp; anadin extra! For those with reluctant partners presumably...
Tough draw for Sunderland!! 
Why does phil Neville look like he's wearing a Phil Neville mask on the bench tonight?!
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 fuck off the pair of yer!
@NOELY1982 @JohnCampbell610 I'm not a cunt to be fair... Lazy yes, no arguments there...
@JohnCampbell610 @NOELY1982 to be fair united were playing that day!
Lionel Messi would shit his pants in that!
@McFc_Kieran that's why Rooney was rested! It'd have played havoc with his weave that!!
God bless clattenburg! Called a halt just as I was about to nip out for a cig!
Ask a silly q though?! I remember tony Gubba asking Colin harvey what the main difference was at the end of the 89 cup final; '1 goal'!!
I know it's easy to give Ashley young stick... That's why we do it!!!
@JohnCampbell610 managed to miss the build up. Give evra a rest for gods sake! He's missed about 10 games since he joined!
Presume Fabio isn't playing because Evra's height at set pieces is an advantage v stoke!!
@StanCollymore @talkSPORT chinny reckon! Back on Saturday!
@FootballGib @LesRosbifs click baiting. Gets the numbers up.
@FootballGib @LesRosbifs agreed but subeditors are notorious for this kind of thing. Especially at the guardian...
@FootballGib @LesRosbifs so it's the subheading (not done by author) that's misinformed, not the article...
@BadReducation @barneyrednews the advert was a pic of Leighton with a load of fluffy devils in his hands. Amazed if he held on to them!
@BadReducation @barneyrednews was that around 88-89? I remember utd marketing a 'city have bananas, we have devils' thing. Flopped badly!
@NOELY1982 #NameYourWillyAfterASoccerPlayer  Danny Wallace, small, explosive when it comes off. And black.
@mattwalsh25 @FergieGumSite Hargreaves! The great what if! Poor sod!
@StuartMaconie when you did the 'coolest guy in the hospital' joke on air did you do the follow up gag to it? (Only heard it on the 6ad)
@NOELY1982 ole!!
You'd think ken Barlow would've flown back from canada for his sons wedding. Or someone would've asked why he wasn't there...
@ColinMurray @ScottRichardss can't unfortunately, I'm out all day. Sorry.
@ColinMurray 'where were the Germans? And frankly who cares?!' Barry Davies 88 Olympic hockey final...
Roy Keane the pub bore who argues black is white. Can't knock him as a player. Went on 2 years too long though...
Munich playing 'feed the world' at the end of the city match? Extraordinary choice of full time tune!
@JohnCampbell610 definitely needs the gold chain thing going on... Still the 3 piece works it magic once again!!
2 minutes injury time in a half with 6 subs made? #Moyestime
Steve Round: 'no time for love dr moyes, we got game to win...'
Kagawa really isn't gonna be much cop is he?!
@NOELY1982 fair enough
@NOELY1982 whys Kolorov captain? I thought zabaleta was vice skipper?
@NOELY1982 what's zabaleta done?
Buttner! Right on the stamp!
@UtdRantcast 'drinking a brew, drinking a brew...' 
@FootballInT80s Clive Goodyear?
@FootballInT80s Steve lynex?
@JohnCampbell610 it's a sign!!
@UtdRantcast roy Keane calls for cool heads?! Roy Keane?!
@lukeymoore and they definitely had SNES' in when I was last in there...
@lukeymoore there's a shop in streatham that deals with this kind of thing. Think it's called 'retro mania' worth looking up...
@FXMC1957 it was the Irish bit that flummoxed me . Sing away ! A well deserved win!
@terrychristian 'it was 21 years today (yesterday)/that Eric taught the boys to play....'
@FXMC1957 which one?
@TypicalCity Gerry creaney scored the winner at Leeds once ya spoilt get!
@DougieAndo but can you do it on a wet Tuesday night in streatham?
Why are Newcastle in their away kit?!
Jake Humphreys really is awful!! Bring back bob Wilson!
Absolutely ridiculous spell by my Mitchell Johnson there! His folks in Rock Ridge will be pleased...
If only the rest of the batsmen (bell aside) had the stones of Monty! I suppose England would end up posting football scores but hey ho...
@Randy_Rann just the 230!! Do yourself a favour and go to bed! I'm listening to the smiths to cheer myself up whilst watching this!
Excellent work Monty! Just 3 &amp; 1/2 days of that to go!
@Harxy it's ok! Monty's got previous in batting out for a draw!
@Harxy I know! It's like watching your favourite cow being driven to the abattoir! You shouldn't watch but somehow can't help it!!
@Harxy go back to bed! Nothing to see here!
@TypicalCity @NOELY1982 a terrible state of affairs. Hope he pulls through &amp; can play again
@Randy_Rann him &amp; Monty! A pair to save any test!!
@Randy_Rann nice one Mitch! This drinks on you!!
@Randy_Rann still Nelson!!
@Randy_Rann oh well done!! Yer jinx!!!
@Randy_Rann isn't that like snorting coke &amp; smoking weed?! No home made rum?
@Randy_Rann I'm determined not to take a sip of my beer till they score a run! Wish they'd hurry up, it's getting warm!!
@NOELY1982 @TypicalCity imagine vini Reilly playing that live!
@NOELY1982 @TypicalCity although that gig only has 1 or 2 arsenal songs so a bit of a weird choice...
I'm not superstitious or anything but can we get off Nelson please?! #Ashes2013
@NOELY1982 @TypicalCity that gig on the your arsenal reissue is on YouTube. I watched it earlier. Can't whack a bit of Alsatian cousin!
@NOELY1982 and another!
@RedNewsStats @barneyrednews 1500?
@lukeymoore didn't he take out Gary Neville in the same game but no one cared cos everyone thought he was shit? Danny Mills eh?!
@martinkelner have you seen the 'customers also shopped for' page for your book? 4 tins of tuna £15 &amp; a jim'll fix it key ring!! (£3.45!)
@FootballInT80s mike hooper?
@FootballInT80s mark Higgins?
@FootballInT80s Stewart mckimmie?!
@robholdsworth they've sold the whole city of Manchester to the sheikhs haven't they?!
I'd suggest the couple in the @Betway advert have a gambling addiction!
@ajhmurray he dies in the end... Then comes back to life... Then gets off again...
@StreathamComedy does the 'superb compere' do crap magic though?! No mention of that on that poster!
@StreathamComedy 'talent borrows, genius steals!' Apparently! :-)
@David_Cameron for a party that is so against nationalisation you're not half ok with other nations owning UK industry!
Boof!! He's got a foot like a traction engine!!
@FergieGumSite love cleverley's  pirouette and pass to no one! Every time! It's the new phil Neville step over!
@StreathamComedy saw this in a Manchester pub. Branching out? 
@Joey7Barton isn't that just his &amp; his brother's business though? I mean if you want to talk rap sheets?
@mrjimBob it's all our business!! No, thinking about it, it's just their own...
@phowax like graham gooch on the spectrum. However you directed the joystick led to a cover drive! Stick to stick cricket. More realistic!
@barrymillard58 @UtdBeforeFergie indeed. Any details on that friendly?
@barrymillard58 @UtdBeforeFergie never seen that pic before. Look at Bobby's face!
Ah Edie reader in @bbcqt perfect!
Isn't this a bit above crimewatch's remit??!! 
 
@jamesofwalsh errr yes!! When is it?!
@TransWorldSport ferenc puskas to Eddie the eagle Edwards in a heartbeat! Glorious stuff!!
Looking forward to this @Wheildons Caribbean casserole with match &amp; a beer tonight!
carragher/hyppia chat is a bit awkward! Jamie sounding like a kid who'd won the chance to interview a footballer from jim'll fix it!
Jesus! Celtic don't half shoot themselves in the foot!! How easy a chance do you want?!
@aluntracey @terrychristian @_TheGMan @numan_2 @5WrightStuff Jim Davidson
@TypicalCity cracking match that. What defences?!
@NOELY1982 @Joey7Barton 94 was kanchelskis, schmeichel &amp; Michel vonk's fault!
@ajarrodkimber technically speaking they're our (pom) shores! It's not called 'Queensland' for nothing!
Get in broady!! #Ashes2013
@JamesHReeve can't be worse than the channel 5 doc last week that claimed the real killer was in the car behind &amp; it was an accident!!
Am I the only person in the world who can see that Andros Townsend is fucking shit ??!!
@NOELY1982 @JabezCleggMCR has to be really...
@NOELY1982 @JabezCleggMCR yes I'd imagine his retirement would've hit them hard!
@LesRosbifs uefa gave the original champions league rights to itv because of bob Wilson. True story
@gdunne1972 @UtdBeforeFergie @MikeDuxbury2 he set up the winner for Blackmore
@shitlondon I thought that was about the Fall playing clapham later!
@JamesHReeve buns &amp; biscuits !! Always has been, always will be!
@MUDieHards @UtdBeforeFergie are they Anderson's personal trainers?!
@Markesmith is this one of those raffles where the people running it may end up winning it?! I'll save my pound for snuff if it is!!
@johnjmoloney she'd probably be only the 2nd strangest woman in there too...  #Balham
Mexican wrestling? Obscure Australian sports? Competitive sheep shearing? Transworld Sport, how I've missed thee!!  #TransWorldSport
@barneyronay I studied ww1 at a level. Buggered if I know what it was over!
@bbcstrictly why is mark strong dressed like blofeld when dancing to gold finger?! The clues in the title...
The hardest man in all of town...
Have they got a new Jane in Rod, Jane &amp; Freddy?!
Tipping Point: 'Hanoi is the capital of which Asian country?' Contestant answers; 'japan'!!!! What went wrong with education in this nation?
@TypicalCity there's a gag about these being the riches of the poor in there somewhere but I'll not sink to it...
Just like to report I'm the owner of a healthy anus apparently...
I've never seen a winger play with his back to goal as much as young!! The shit bastard!!
Must say I'm quite enjoying this itv4 coverage of the bundesliga... It's like euro goals but with the commentary in sync with the action!
What is Poyet defending? The goalie didn't 'get his head cut off!' You twat!
Couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke! Poyet the racist apologist!
Steve Harper still doing wonders for Newcastle!
What on earth are the Sunderland players arguing at?!
Pardew's 'instruction' you cross to him, you score a goal! Very partridgesque!
I was amused by sturridges hissy fit at Suarez for going for goal rather than pass. It'd have held more weight if he wasn't marked!!
@TypicalCity I'll tell you in march!
@TypicalCity till one of them snaps their leg &amp; they combust... Usually around the February mark...
@hoolie2 @UtdBeforeFergie did he get up again?!
#PleaseRT 
When nigella Lawson divorced Saaatchi, who got to keep the fake friends?
@RLWC2013 no idea who's playing when, no tv coverage, no news... Not much chance of drawing in the casual fan...
@UEFAcom yes because the racists won't move seats or anything... Why bother? Just say racism is fine &amp; save yourselves the trouble...
@TypicalCity it'd be nice if the guvnors reformed for a one off when their fans arrive at eastlands...
@Bernard_Butler @timpayton so yes hats off to arsenal (hope they win too!)
@Bernard_Butler @timpayton arsenal have always been good for this &amp; always a full house. Utd will be lucky to get 35000 tonight.
@timpayton @Bernard_Butler to be fair united requested this but Norwich refused as they get a cut of the gate money apparently...
@SkyFixerJim @terrychristian when did we do jury selection in this country? Isn't that an American thing?
I've thought about it &amp; feel now is about the right time for a babylon zoo revival...
@NOELY1982 ah gotcha... But that would give her an air of musical respectability. 28 would be funnier... No one cares about the 28 club!
@NOELY1982 chinny reckon?!
Why do @officalitv4 feel the need to provide superfluous celebrity gossip in the middle of a film? Especially every hour!
@GNev2 having been told by the kaiser no less, before the game it's pronounced 'Shirley' why are you continuing to call him 'sherler'?
It must be awful following Celtic home &amp; away knowing that ultimately it's a futile existence unless rangers are at full strength...
Balotellis dive just now v Parma; truly a thing of comical beauty!!
@RobDawsonMEN @mrmujac Neil Webb
Proper united second half that.
@ManUtdFF yet you try &amp; find a palace top in the SE19/25 area! I've seen more Boro tops than palace ones down here!
@ManUtdFF asking Hargreaves about fergie's view of him is a bit brave though...
@ManUtdFF Mcmanaman can't talk w/o sounding like he's being accused of something! Which being scouse...
@NOELY1982 I'll not disappoint! The white room was ace! Marc almond &amp; gene, Albarn &amp; ray Davies, Noel &amp; weller. Top stuff!
@NOELY1982 clever huh?
@NOELY1982 this one?
@TypicalCity Uwe?
@rioferdy5 can she play midfield?
@ManUtdFF Koke from Atletic playerwise
@martynhardacre @Jesusontwittorr or meat on a Friday! You'll burn in hell if you have a sausage roll today!
@ManUtdFF the debt isn't helping united &amp; may make them more attractive to serious buyers. It's a moot point as they'll never do it anyway.
@ManUtdFF I'd spend the £350m paying off the debt but that's just me...
@Franz_Ferdinand a speedboat
... er! (Shit!!)
Steven Gerrard isn't just a top top player, he's a top top top top top (how many characters have I got left?) top top top top top top play
@JohnCampbell610 beat utd og? Pally v Chelsea that same season. The epitome of a toblerone foot from 20 yards facing AWAY from goal!
Ah appears he never was voted as such. Carry on Patrice...
When was Lizarazu voted best left back in the world?!
Funny how Morrissey refers to Muhammed Ali as Cassius Clay only in his book!! #definiteracist call the NME!
@weddingpresent come play with me! Or California. Eithers good
@StuartMaconie never listened to freak zone before. Really enjoying it tonight (I'm in hospital &amp; it's helping !) shall tune in again...
