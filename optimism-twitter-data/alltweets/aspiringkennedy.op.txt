The only problem with watching #bandofbrothers is that I never want to stop. Late nights turn into laaaaaate nights. #sogood
@K8_smallthings I don't either. I need a fregging tutorial from a 20 year old on how to use it for social media? #confused

An easy (and FUN!) way to spend the day out of London. Check out my new quick guide to spending the day in #Windsor. 
Stroll through the garden at @LauraAshleyUK's hotel. The perfect way to walk off breakfast pastries <YELLOW HEART> #luxtravelchat 
@donnapants I'm terrified of the day when V starts to try these same tactics. (And Jonah has the strength to pull them off.) ;)
Breakfast: Scientifically proven to taste better when you didn't have to make it or clean it up. 
@donnapants Hahah! I miss him! :) He is so cute/hilarious/awesome.
The views of London in the distance aren't too shabby, but I still like looking at this guy, too <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #fromwhereimeating

@jesskboyd #nopressure because it's in the bag. ;)
@sarakerens thanks friend! Wish you could have been there for the fun, too! x
@lindsaykw27 That's weird. I'd email the contact info on the site and try to get in touch with someone? Sounds like their site is wonky?
@lindsaykw27 ha! How nice! And no way! I have made so many great friends through blogging! #totallynormal
@TheYuppieFiles me too! I was imagining just a brunch with friends... But could not complain at how cute it turned out!
I think Winston definitely deserves having a flower named after him.

Popsicles. Slightly underrated, but never a let down.
@lindsaykw27 no! New to me! But if you go, I would love to hear what you think! Always looking for great new things like that!
The fact that Kate gave birth, did her hair, strode out in heels within 12 hours makes her immortal. #royalbaby

A little @Disney_UK treat just arrived... But  was immediately confiscated by an unnamed source. #disneytsumtsum 
Loving the time at home with this sweet girl girl. Toddlers, while emotionally unstable, are also a really good time. 
@JessOnThames @londonisyours Thanks- have heard @Browns_Hotel is gorgeous. Hoping it makes our summer review!
@AmanduhHelen I've heard good things about @horseguardsLDN but never been. Actually looking for a nice rec near there, good idea!

Notting Hill blooms + a bump. All our weekend action shared on the blog. #aspiringkennedy 
@TalentedTalkers just doing my part. ;) but seriously, when you find the answer to blog/work/life balance- send it to me! Still searching!
@TalentedTalkers haha- no way. I keep those for myself. But I am happy for them to use the "generous" promo codes for 10% companies send ;)
@TalentedTalkers I employ a small army of skinny and fabulous creatives to create content for me and act as body doubles. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #lbloggers
@restlesstech @torimcp Haha... yes, oops. That's what I meant. I think we connected via twitter a while back. :)
@torimcp @restlesstech ha! Yes- but it was a while back, after another trip to Europe. Is that right?!
@restlesstech Hi! How fun! If youre sticking to that area: @AmpersandHotel, Candella or Kensington Orangery are great bets! (Book ahead!)
@barrygcooper This made @TylerDKnight and I laugh so hard. Honestly, we can not tell if that is or isn't you. #nevertell
How did two semesters of classes go by SO fast? But beyond digital publishing, 3D modeling and Python... here's... 
A little glamour shot before leaving today... Proud of #KCL and to be a part of the @kingsartshums dept. #DH 
A bit emotional leaving my final class ever. I still have a dissertation and my own classrooms to teach,but so grateful for this year. #KCL
@cupsaucerblog @essiebutton never been! Have a great time though! @_nouveau has been and loved it. She may have good recs? #Copenhagen
News reports keep calling the #GermanWingsCrash a "suicide"- but with a plane of 149 others, "murder" seems like a more appropriate term.
@TABauman86 yes, it is terribly cruel. So disheartening.
What a dark day as news is revealed on #Germanwings crash. I'm dumbstruck from the latest news. Praying for peace for family members.
Seventh night in a row that I'm working until 1am. Not sustainable for the long-term, but necessary to keep... 
Today, @_nouveau and I treated ourselves with @Eurostar's sale. Happy to have a girls day in Paris to celebrate the (almost) end to school!
@nicholasmuncey your birthday wish is my command! :) Hope you're having an aesthetically pleasing and gourmetly caffeinated day!
Favorite day trips from #reykjavik? The more adventuresome the better. Preferably in winter. Lay it on me, #travelbloggers. #iceland
A giant box of #girlscout cookies just arrived from TX to London. Feeling all the feelings for @tperot as we dig in <TWO HEARTS>

@steph_gay glad to know I'm not alone! ;) #greatmindseatalike
@anniefitz I know. I can't stop thinking about how terrible it was for everyone on board.
Feeling sick to my stomach about the news of #germanwings flight. Prayers for the family and loved ones of all on board.

@runlolarun Thanks, Lola! That is a great start!
Who of my #travelblogger friends can send me a good guide to Istanbul? Obviously, must see sites + the best food is the combination needed.

@MelKirk Come on over! We are having a (LATE) breakfast here. In fact, I need to just refer to it as "brunch." ;) #PancakeDay
Paris bound this week to celebrate Viola's birthday. We have two days in Paris and two at Disney...... 
This week is work, work and Paris! Headed there Friday for Viola's birthday. Disney, Laduree, and a left bank apartment await us. #PARIS
Pancake Day! (Bananas, Nutella, Coconut, Almonds + Whipped Cream) | How do you dress yours? #pancakeday 
How @united has handled this is a peek into the psyche of a failing airline: Take no responsibility, blame others, keep quiet. #unitedfail
Has @united said directly to customers regarding the tickets they cancelled? Or are they hiding behind mass emails and one PR? #unitedfail
USPS. Royal Mail. La Poste. Doesn't matter want the country- you're gonna be standing in line for ages. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE> 
London: ISO the best lemon tart in the city. Centrally located a must, great ambiance necessary, good view is nice but not required. Go!
@steph_gay oh good tip... Are there direct flights from London? #Greece #Travel
Summer travel consults are in full swing- all my clients plans have me itching to make our own adventure. Santorini with a newborn?! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I can't believe it is 2015 and I'm still getting daily invitations to play Candy Crush. NO. NO. NO.
Thinking through this summer... Anyone in the Northeast US want to do a house swap for late July or early August?... 
Now it's time to take care of the other love in my life... Me. ;) Ha! TV, blogging, bath and a little time to unwind before bed.
Happy to share him with her and have him show her what love is all about. (Today and everyday!) <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ #valentines

@candicedebleu @united could not agree more- and especially don't like their victimized statement that customers were "taking advantage"
@SuddenlyCaitlin @united Oh man. The IT department is off. Customer Service dept is terrible. Makes me scared of what flight crews are like!
#UnitedAirlines is not only canceling tickets they published/sold, but blaming customers by saying they were "taken advantage of." Bad form.
We had our summer vacation sorted until @united CANCELLED and didn't honor their published fares via a terribly unapologetic email. #United
@cupsaucerblog korfball??!!
@MelKirk ah- @_nouveau has a sausage dog, Pippa, that is pretty darn cute!

@anniefitz that looks so, so good!!
@AliMcNamara oooh! Where is the signing?! Would love to finally get to meet you in the flesh!
@KatyByrneDesign girl- I have to or I feel crazy. I aim for 9-10, but it definitely doesn't always happen.
@kat__harrington not always!! But when I don't get at least 8, I feel wrecked all day! How much do you sleep?!
Does anyone really get less than 8 hours a night on a regular basis? Surely you can't actually live like that long term. #sleepjunky
Mind the gap, ladies and gentlemen. #dailycommute #tickettoride 
Yup. #Montythepenguin got me. Tears while waiting for the lift at school. @johnlewisretail Christmas Ads are just too good.
Don't typically hit up @Starbucks, but I did today and it felt so nostalgic and nice. Plus, does anyone do a soy latte better? No.
Facing the age-old weekend debate: Should I use this time to be productive... Or to take a nap? I think we know where this ends.

@MeganAcrossPond when you say "catch up," are you referring to having a baby, too??
@MeganAcrossPond You don't owe these girls anything. In fact, it's probably best we keep them humble. :) I, however, owe you two emails.
Hey @LizDenfeld look at the picture hanging in the tea room we stopped at in Venice. This is getting weird! #Fuzzyzoom 
One more day left in Venice. Tomorrow we should absolutely make sure that we.... #FILLINTHEBLANK
@KellyeWest haha- we laughed pretty hard about that when it came through :) #zombie
@EleBusing I'm not gonna lie- I was sweating it for a while! ;) Luckily, we made it out and so did our friends!
@satriyo_agungN You're sweet! We are having a great time! Thanks for your tweet. Have a great week!
Oh yes, loved it! Went in Oct/Nov 12- in case it's hard to find. #notarchivedyet :)RT @juliamanchik: @LizDenfeld I will! Thank you!
Thanks for letting me know!:) RT @novelnomad: Planning a trip to Edinburgh for visiting friends - def grateful for @aspiringkennedy's tips.
@steph_gay thanks! We made it! And alpine skiing = hot chocolate and fondue. I'm in!
Hawaii? Now that's going to be stuck in my "beard" all day! ;) RT @KellyeWest: @aspiringkennedy Hawaii. Now. Please.
@satriyo_agungN Aw, thanks! I can't get enough of those places... Each is so different and so special. I'd like a lifetime in each :)
@AshSunshine904 ok... Bulgaria?? How/Why does that make the list? It's so off my radar, but now I feel like I'm missing something!
@Kalady88 ah, can't disagree with that option.... But I may be biased. Hope you get back someday soon!
@mrschaefer11 That sounds like a pretty legitimate plan to me... Someone needs to be making sure it's getting done. :)
@SapphireLindsay haha... That IS random! But a hilarious choice. Well played. :)
On the plane and getting ready to head out to Venice. If you could hop a plane to anywhere in Europe today, where would you go?
Packing for Venice in the morning. :) Please don't bother our flight, snow. That'd be super uncool of you. #justsaying
@lanaasummitt You're so sweet! I'm just not up for buying maternity clothes to wear for a few weeks. BTW How cute are you?! And sooo close!
@lauryngalloway can you install apps on ya FB page? #feellikeamoron
@andybpd07 What are some places you like? I'm not opposed to it, just haven't found good spots that aren't overly touristy...?
Getting ready to meet a friend for the afternoon. What to wear, what to wear? So many choices. #not #noclothesthatfit
Is there a way to link Instagram pics to a Facebook page (not profile?) #helpasisterout!
@AnneTaite Does it?? Ha! They really are SO friendly &amp; helpful. Especially when someone's ringing up fraud charges in Qatar in your name. :)
I dedicate this to each &amp; every expat blogger I know &amp; love. ;) RT @MeganAcrossPond: Want to live abroad?? READ HERE: 
Do you want to move to Europe and aren't sure where to start? Here are 5 basics you'll need to know for moving... 
The difference in customer service phone calls between the US and UK could not be more opposite... And Capital One might win out over all.
God bless you for this. :) PS Your party looked SO fun!!! xx RT @KappaPrep: ... I've never seen anyone as tiny that's carrying multiples!!
@duchessbelle well if so, they are on to something. These dark days with so little sunlight are pretty killer! #januaryblues
@btransatlantic It's true, I'm super pregnant! Its slightly alarming. We will need to busy out the panoramic lens in the next few weeks! :)
I have to say, watching someone do manual labor is a lot more enjoyable than doing it with them. #lifelesson
I'm proud to live in a country where Love Actually is aired... In January. #tistheseason? #England
Hey, people! Good news: one of you gets an awesome pair of designer sunglasses courtesy of Sunglasses Shop.... 
Today's mail included three Christmas cards from friends.... Which is why they are my friends. #birdsofafeather
I use (and love!) FabK for my blog design work... But I'm curious, who do you think does great &amp; affordable blog designs?
Someone called me "Big Mama" today. No point in trying to deny it or get fussy about it. #truthbetold
Second trip to IKEA in a week. They may keep their prices low, but a couple of hours there will get my blood pressure jacked up. #everytime
I think the correct response here is "Youre Welcome?" ;)RT @TheYuppieFiles: Thanks to @aspiringkennedy all I've wanted this week are donuts!
Ha! While studying in Italy, I was eating ab 7 a day &amp; my armpits started to smell like oranges. #awesome  RT @theretohereblog @thebootblog
@thebootblog they are the best... I keep trying to think of a good recipe for them, but straight up is the best solution I can think of!
@alaythea I mean, I don't normal get emotional over fruit- but these babies touch my heart in a very special way. ;) #gettingweirdovercitrus
@MrsNJanney it just seems like god made them so incredibly accessible and easy to peel so that we can eat them in large quantities. :)
All is great! Thanks :) RT @twirlingclare @MatchbookMag Thank you Lauren! Hope all is well with you as you get ready for your new addition !
Can we start a twitter round table discussion over the delights of Clementine Oranges? I've probably (seriously) eaten 100 this month.
@ashoe_esq Oh... Man, that somewhat disappoints me, but also makes complete sense... And also makes me hungry for Cherry Garcia ice cream.
@twirlingclare I didn't know you were working with @MatchbookMag! What a perfect fit. :) #congrats!!!
Hey @ashoe_esq ... Your about me blurb gave me quite the chuckle tonight. #bcimsurethatswhyyouwroteit
Me: Hey... Umm. How many Oreos are you eating?? @TylerDKnight: Probably just 12. Not too hungry. #seriously #ithoughtiwasobeseforeatingfive
:) RT @btransatlantic: happy anniversary to @aspiringkennedy and her handsome husband! love this kind of love :) 
It's Monday and there is some work to be done. Half of me loves the challenge of a massive to-do list... Half of me wants to hide.
@luellaandjune We used to sail the BVI in college and would stop there for dinner. It's gorgeous... :) I'm jealous just thinking about it.
Happy Anniversary to my love! A little recap on where we have been... and where we are headed next. :) #LOVE 
90% makes me black out &amp; do crazy things. RT @hisugarplum: Uh-oh. #danger #walkaway #gatewaytohoarding 
That just seems ludicrous. This is America. RT @CampPatton: Embarrassed over how disappointed I am that Costco closes at 6 on Saturdays.
@tulipjess Due date is March 16, but with twins they said to plan for end of Feb. Congrats to you as well. What's your DD?
This was so sweet! RT @youmaywander: Links to my fave travel blog posts recently - 
@will_uk Hi!! :) The bump's getting HUGE! I'm working on the perfect nursery that @bethdotolo created for us. :) What are you working on??
@steph_gay Ooh, really? Well that will have to be background noise while we hack through IKEA set up. :) Hope you have a great weekend!! :)
Happy Weekend! We're relaxing with extra sleep, PBJs, junk tv &amp; working on turning a certain guest room into a nursery. What are you up to?
@Beinam You are so sweet!! Thank you for posting about Aspiring Kennedy! :) And enjoy your trip to London!! xx
PATCH NYC made an awesome collection for Target... and now it's on sale. Sale + Good Design = My favorite. 
To the friends/family who spoiled us with baby shower goodies- I salute you. Our flat is officially jam packed. We feel the love!
@itsahuntlife Fair enough... I mean, it's not like you're not already several life steps ahead of the rest of us. :)
Back to blogging after a long winter's nap... and trying to snap out of the Christmas blues! #NOTTINGHILL 
@lauryngalloway I know! Gulp. Ready or not.... ;)
That's what I think, too! Sigh. #hotmess RT @angelina41: baby octopus!
I agree!!! It makes me believe in God in a whole new way! RT @btransatlantic: biology is SO WEIRD. very cool, but weird. #babymama
Girl- it is! I've been great! When are you gonna go for round #2? ;) RT @itsahuntlife: that is a lot of limbs. hope you are feeling good!!!
The feeling of 8 limbs moving around inside you is exciting, nerve-wracking, adorable and slightly disgusting. #cocktailofemotion #7mthspreg
Still dreaming of it!:) RT @LauraAshleyUK Blogger Christmas Gift wishes from @Will_UK @aspiringkennedy @shinythoughts 
I've been sucked into the twilight zone of American refrigerated goods. #anditsbeenawesome

Thank you! Love #HHM RT @GreatDateGuide: ... Great issue by the way ;) @hearthomemag @fabricofmylife @aspiringkennedy @photosprinkles
That was a REALLY solid list! I also love Newmans Arms Pie Room. :) RT @juliarosinus: @Will_UK these all sound SO yummy! Thanks, Will!
@lovelyjubblyldn Ah! I'm so jealous! I was really wanting to make it- but you're right!! @TylerDKnight was there and said it was wonderful!'
@stephaniermay Yay! When will you be in town?! And WHO did you meet? #bigapple #smallworld
The Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant. Obviously, I'm thrilled. Your turn to weigh in starts now. #royalbaby 
@steph_gayi I totally watched this. Kinda hilarious, but nonetheless... Wouldn't have missed it. :)
@steph_gayi have been worried over the same thought for weeks. #kidding #notkidding #actuallyhavebeenwondering
Kate Middleton is officially knocked up. This just makes me all warm and fuzzy. #bestfriendsforever
@steph_gay ha! Luckily, Kensington is only about a ten minute walk from our place. She can come over to see it any time. ;)
Obviously. PS I'm freaking out. RT @stephmgregory: Hey @aspiringkennedy, are royal play dates expected in your future?
YES! Kate &amp; I are pregnant in London at the same time, which basically means we are one step closer to being best friends. #KateMiddleton
@GesciM haha... Hey, no prob with being honest! I like some good discussion. Always welcome on AK! ;)
Woohoo! £10 of Starbucks for only £5. Thank you @livingsocial. 
Get ready... you're headed to Dublin! #IRELAND 
Boarded a plane back to London... Which means my semester is officially over and I'm on Christmas break. #woohoo
I would wear those @loefflerrandall boots all over this flippin continent. #EUROPE #currentbootsarefallingapart @MatchbookMag
Thanks for the delicious recommendation, @loreperez3! Loving The Queen of Tarts- perfect lunch/tea spot. #DUBLIN  
@ltsbadventurers that's actually where we ended up going! we were wandering that way and when i saw it- we went for it! thanks for the rec!
@somethinglegit Its from @giginytweets... @bethdotolo has one, too. It's the cutest! Get one and we can all be twinks. ;)
What's a great place for dinner in #DUBLIN?
Gonna be fun! #OKC :) RT @TylerDKnight: Let the countdown begin! “@eannebo: @TylerDKnight SO excited to see you in a few weeks!”
This entire exhange made me laugh! I have been a closet fan from day 1! ;) #madeinchelsea RT @KappaPrep: @beantownprep @katiekloberdanz
Having a bus drive by and completely soak you with a giant puddle is grounds for immediate re-routing &amp; sulking with a latte in Starbucks:)
@LizDenfeld Get a Bellini at Harry's Bar (the birthplace!). It's $$$ but fun. :) Last, the bell tower next to St Marks has awesome views!
@LizDenfeld Murano - glass island, Burano- lace island that is WAY cuter and less popular. Take the vaperetto out there.
@LizDenfeld Crud. I'm pretty sure I've posted one but my travel log isn't 100% (or 50%) updated. :( Main advice: don't miss Burano!
This no one can deny! #hotfriends RT @MeganAcrossPond: @aspiringkennedy @LizDenfeld and @marshallsabroad too. of course.
Happy Thanksgiving dear! :) RT @LizDenfeld: Thanks for having me friend! RT Thanksgiving if you aren't in America?

@btransatlantic I have NO idea but it keeps happening... And I can't untwist it. So stupid!
@steph_gay Seriously. I feel smart for reading Jane Austen... And then I realize that is basically Brit Lit for Dummies. :)
@steph_gay Oh man- that sounds above my intelligence level. :) Is your hub a big Hardy buff? I've actually never read any of his books!
Headed to Dorset for a private party in Thomas Hardy's home, Max Gate. This either makes me cool or really nerdy. Most likely the latter.
After 2.5 years of living in the UK, I'm eating my first flapjack.... It's pretty much exactly what I expected. #gotmilk?
Feeling pretty cool about fitting in a pre-maternity dress tonight- til I got home, sat on the floor &amp; split it the entire length of my butt
Yum! Did you like it?! #FRANCE RT @TheYuppieFiles: I made your Dijon pasta tonight! And went a little chive crazy, oops 
This sweater is my new favorite thing. Sharing the holiday love and getting a few to you! #FOURSALE

Sunday nights can be the worst night of the week... Or the best night if you don't have anywhere you need to be in the morning.
It's nice coming home from a long day of work to find a lone Oreo sitting on your stairs that your friend left for you on her evening walk.
That was probably my fav part! :) RT @chasingheartbts: @sgmtucker so ridiculously cute. I LOVE that you both picked the same book :)
@AshleyELittle thanks ashley! :) how are you???

@btransatlantic we each know one and are going to tell the other the other half this afternoon!:)
@GesciM I wish- but no videoing allowed. Silly UK rules. :)
@jenni20designs aw, you're so sweet! Our sono tech kept laughing when I'd point out an "adorable" body part and be on the wrong part. Hah!!
@LizDenfeld We each found out one and are going to tell the other this afternoon. Fun day! I feel like Im newly engaged or something :)
