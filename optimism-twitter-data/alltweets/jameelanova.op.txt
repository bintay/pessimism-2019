And I wouldn't be dumb enough to have children if I would be struggling to look after them.
I'm not here for victim mentality. 9/10 you're the reason you're in a minimum wage job, please let's not lie.
That should motivate you to progress your life.

We're probably pretty bad compared to north-west/Scandinavian Europe but in terms of Africa, Asia and even the U.S. we're lucky.
We're actually so lucky in the UK with the employment laws we have. Other countries are so bad and you don't even know it.

I mean...we can ask why the northern hemisphere is the northern hemisphere but yall not ready for such topics....
Yes...disproportion 
@BakaOmubo LOL true
It's crazy white people throughout history have even altered maps to make Africa and even Asia seem inferior.
I hate it when people make fun of people younger than them for things they go thru at their age. Maybe you've forgotten when that was you.

Don't mind me. I'm just rambling tonight lol
Anyone can be pretty. You're not special if you're pretty.
And if no one wants to like me for my personality then I don't wanna be liked at all lmao I'll be ugly don't look at me
@fuIani LMAOOOOOO just tryna be real
FIRST OF ALL I value my personality, humour and intelligence way more than my beauty. I don't wanna be liked for how I look that's basic
@ErroneousGenius LMAO ok I definitely tweet like an ugly girl
@LaBritishChick same as my @ name jameelanova lol
If you know me in real life I'm reserved and shy. I don't like a lot of attention <WEARY FACE>
So many people have called me a fake account because I'm pretty but I'm not desperate for attention :(
I hate this bird generation. Instagram likes don't mean anything in real life

@Toussaint215 arabs are a topic for another day LOL
@Mwaniki_Nyagah oh I know...I'm just sayin the focus is more on "lets hold hands and support each other" rather than actually doing the work
She said they're all plastic from surgery. I can't deal lmao
So Saudi's royal family are at the uni my sister works at and she said she's never come across such a collection of arrogant behaviour <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@OckyJ83 yes, financially, economically...not a false sense of oneness. Pan Africanism is a distraction IMO
@Unbroken_Noodle it's weird...I'm like why? Lol
@JuGroovy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> it sure is
Europeans aren't one big chummy family but the EU gets things done. Politics isn't supposed to be friendly.
The EU functions (I use that word loosely)...why do Africans have to hold hands and sing kumbayah to function in the name of pan Africanism?
Pan-Africanism is also a load of Americanised rubbish. Don't @ me.
(African) Americans trying to define Africans and Arabs by colour is just an example of Americanisation BS. Race is YOUR thing. Not ours.
@Luke_FLYtalker lmao full of the pan African flag
Pretty and smart gang!!! <OPEN HANDS SIGN>üèΩ
Only ignorant people are overly patriotic. The world isn't a competition lol

Lol SLAYYYY!!!!! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèΩ 
Americans live in fairy land. Why would I listen to an American white OR black tell me about my history? I won't.
The thing about African Americans self-proclaimed African knowledge is its skewed. Everything American is skewed.
Delusional African Americans who think they know everything about Africa and black people  
The sooner everyone realises Africans and Arabs are not defined by colour the better.
@Toussaint215 very. I wish the delusions from both side would stop lol
@lunarnomad <SKULL><SKULL><SKULL> I believe you get hit by a fuckin car that's what I wish LMAO

Ewww. I'm not here for hotep African Americans trying to teach African history.
@BeEazyFam @alina_mmz @GodsCheckmate block me then, you fuckin ignorant bastard. Don't talk about things you don't know about.

Ass and boobs look like they're about to pop. Can you walk properly? #YouOkSis
These ladies with huge fake boobs and asses look like they're in pain. Pls someone help them
@ErroneousGenius u keep missing the point that God isn't Jesus lol if Christians believed that they wouldn't differentiate between the two
@ErroneousGenius I'd assume people believe their things in their religions are facts. Isn't that the whole point of believing lol
@ErroneousGenius religions there is only ONE God n thinkin otherwise is a sin so no matter what religion u follow u believe in the same God
@ErroneousGenius I think what we were both trying to say was that regardless of what other religions people believe in, in our respective
@ErroneousGenius you've been a Christian a Muslim and a Jew? O.o
@ErroneousGenius this goes for Islam Christianity and Judaism. Other religions are way different
@ErroneousGenius but essentially our religions stem from the same place. Man wrote the books man changed the religions but only one God
@ErroneousGenius you can't try and differentiate people's faiths lol I can understand why you constant and compare from the outside
Next person calling me Jameel getting blocked <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
@ErroneousGenius lmao Jameel is the boys version of my name don't do me like that
@ErroneousGenius yes. We're getting somewhere!!!! A messenger is also a prophet but a prophet isn't necessarily a messenger
My name is Jameela btw you know this  
@ErroneousGenius correction I meant prophet not messenger. Prophet Mohammad is the messenger
@ErroneousGenius nope he's our messenger not God
@ErroneousGenius you're the one who asked me if God is a part of God lmaooo. I think what you mean is is Jesus part of Allah.
Dove silk glow makes me smell soooooo good. About to steal husbands outchea
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO ughhhhhhh 
Props to Baltimore for standing up for themselves
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d Allah means God in Arabic
How can you say Muslims and Christians don't believe in the same God. I think we do actually lol
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d Christ isn't God though lol Christians believe he is a part of God, not God. It's not the same
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d do you know the bible and the Torah are our (Muslims) holy books too? Our "Gods" are very much the same
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d like I said, Christians believe Jesus is God not God is Jesus. There's a difference. "Traditional" Muslim lol
Sometimes I feel like I wanna save the world.
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d lmao I wasn't agreeing or disagreeing I don't even know what yall are arguing about. IJS Muslims do agree
I wanna be like #MarilynMosby when I grow up
Question...why now after all the black men that have been killed by police in the US are police being held accountable in Baltimore?
@mylifeis_3d @ErroneousGenius pretty much. It's lowkey offensive to insinuate that Muslims believe in a different God lll
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d neither do other religions except Christianity. Christians believe Jesus is God not God is Jesus. Difference
Goals 
Awwwww Timmy so sweet  
@ErroneousGenius @mylifeis_3d not really lol I'm Muslim and I agree

It's actually permitted in Islam...BILAL 
It's actually normal to marry your cousin in my culture
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....you know what..... 
Let me stop joking about incest <CONFOUNDED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
My mentions are a mess <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
@RexTestarossa @Terence_da_AMOG NB there's not one exact definition....illegal incest is only siblings parents and grandparents
@futimah @fuIani dad rarely mum few times a year when kids are over all the time kmt
Lmfaoooooo I'm joking
Yall never fucked a cousin??? Spice up your life
@Terence_da_AMOG I'm telling you the dictionary definition of it <WINKING FACE>
@futimah @fuIani loooool sad times. Knock before you enter unless you tryna see ass
@fuIani @futimah :((( this topic is making me cringe bc I'm imagining all the girls not clothed in front of their fam <GRIMACING FACE>
Fucking a cousin isn't incest FYI lol 
Right! 
@fuIani @futimah whetttt!!! I'm practically naked in my own room <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Terence_da_AMOG brothers and father live with you. You could've been talking about cousins...bc they def will be
@III_Asherah isn't is usually always family
ANYWAY. Cultural differences <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@fuIani @futimah these kaf....nvm
You're the one who mentioned male relatives. I was talking about brothers and father  
Anyway this conversation won't get anywhere. Some of yall used to walking around your house barely clothed...do you <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You're disgusting for even saying that lol  
@futimah trust me <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Lmao that's fine. But just now they'll be checking her out whether you're aware or not  
Ladies yall prancing around in shorts in front of your dad and brothers or nah? Lol
@Terence_da_AMOG she should be covering up regardless. But again...depends how old she is
@Terence_da_AMOG @ShawnWayne88 it's not even that deep. A mother is tryna protect her daughter from all men. Incest rape can happen
@Terence_da_AMOG it would "provoke them" that was weird
@Terence_da_AMOG lmfao how tf is that incest? A mother told her daughter to cover herself up...nothing wrong with that. Shouldn't have said
@Terence_da_AMOG depends what age she is and what kinda bathing suit it is..
@Terence_da_AMOG you're acting like they were looking at her lol. Maybe you were just raised different.
@fuIani take your tweet back
What a disgusting little girl. Should listen to her mother  
@ShawnWayne88 @Terence_da_AMOG nah. Just because you're related to a man doesn't mean you can be barely clothed in his presence

@imonederful whatever floats their boat lol. If u feel so strongly bout it preach bout women not bein treated fairly n they wouldn't have to
@imonederful to some it might be same salary as a man..to others its being able to sleep with many men. "Feminism" is an umbrella term tbh
@imonederful that's true but not everyone believes in all of those. Like I said...everyone has their own interpretation of equality
@Malkia__ thanks hun <WINKING FACE>
@LexxMontanah you should text me some time <SMIRKING FACE>
@imonederful feminism isn't a religion with rules and a holy book lol every women has their own interpretation of it
The worst is when you think you block someone from every app and they pop up on the one you forget about <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@imonederful @veerrkin Muslim women and are doing so regardless of religion so saying promote Islam won't help. Hasn't stopped them before.
@imonederful @veerrkin I see both POVs. I understand why you think "feminism" is out there but at the same time Muslim men are oppressing..
@imonederful @veerrkin shouldn't you be telling the Muslim oppressors women should be treated equal rather than be mad at feminists lol

Arabic is a language not an adjective but I'm the stupid one? Kk  
Girl same! Jameela is in the Quran idc 
@Razzlar_19 a punishment for all the sins....if I remember correctly
Yeah because non Arab Muslims are stuck with your language and culture so goodbye  
The first one 
Arabs always tryna teach people about their language and culture as if it wasn't forced upon us bc religion. BYE
My guy is insinuating non Arabs have Arabic names because they sound good rather than meaning. Lololol
What the actual fuck are you talking about?!?!? Non-Arabs know Arabic if you didn't know  
SO ARABS ARE THE ONLY ONES ALLOWED TO HAVE ARABIC NAMES????? OH OK
