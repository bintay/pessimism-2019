On the #747 headed to #CenturyPlace #LRT station from @FlyEIA It's good to be back #yeg Now I just have to get home to bed! #tired
At #YVR as I am waiting for my connecting flight with @WestJet to @FlyEIA It's good to travel but always just as good to be back home! #yeg
Way too schloshed and happy to care...#LAS

Hanging with Baby Sister is the best; There's nothing like watching a great cocktail in the making #LAS #Manhattan 
Drink selection is way too dangerous in #LAS plus we travelled to #Paris without leaving the vicinity of the hotel! 
Forgot to pick up a data plan and almost had withdrawal after 24 hours of abstaining. LOL! #LAS
It's such a long taxi down the runway at #YVR that I think we are driving the plane there...
Relaxation beverages at #YVR airport. Hubby's having the @GIB English Bay Pale Ale &amp; I'm enjoying @StellarJay bubbles 
Made it safely to #YVR Having small bite at #VinoVolo while waiting for connecting @WestJet flight to #LAS Excited to reach our destination!
Reading back issue of @AvenueEdmonton &amp; think it's a very sad #yeg fact that almost 62% of Edmontonians have never seen an @EdmOilKings game
@FlyEIA waiting for our flight to #YVR connecting to #LAS Can hear the fake Elvises singing already! Viva Las Vegas!!!


Men take forever to get ready to go out yet they complain about women taking a long time..Not always in our home! Sheesh! Let's get 'er done
No more sleeps; Soon we'll be off to #LAS so Hubby can attend the annual #NAB convention &amp; I'm just along for the ride  &amp; party! Yeah Baby!

Flying solo this evening so listening to tunes while enjoying an #Artlantic #rum cocktail w/dinner of chicken &amp; french toast. Yummy!

Hanging out at #Clareview busterminal #yeg waiting for the #137 to take me to work. Going to be a great day! @TakeETS 
@TakeETS today totally reminds me why #SheldonCooper has #buspants for riding transit! Wowsers! Should be an interesting final journey leg!
Feeling a bit better today so I'm busing it to work. Haven't done this since changing offices. Should be interesting. @TakeETS #yeg
Going to be one of my earliest bedtimes in longer than I can remember. Maybe all the fruit juice I drank plus a good night's sleep will help

Not feeling so great; hope that this is as bad as it gets. Can't breathe, and my ears &amp; eyeballs hurt...I hate headcolds!

Ugh, this cold is killing me...I sure hope it's gone by the weekend or my trip to #LAS may suck; Nah, it's hard to keep me away from fun!!!
Is it really girlie of a guy if he's worried about how a cold sore looks on his face &amp; that you can see it from '3 blocks away'! #whorelip
5:30AM is way too early to be at work but you do what you gotta' do to stay in the game. Hopefully it will mean home early as well to crash!
Off to sleep; a really early start to the day tomorrow and it would be nice to at least get five hours of sleep in. Buona Notte! Besos!
Loved the #SeanHayes episode of #WDYTYA but not the #TonyGoldwyn episode really; the hard luck, tear-jerker episodes are always the best!
Mixed myself a #BrainTeaser &amp; have settled in with some kleenex to watch a couple of episodes of #WhoDoYouThinkYouAre Love watching the show

Really hate when Hubby's away; it hasn't even been one night &amp; I am already lonely &amp; feeling blue! Dammit! This week &amp; part of next week!
The day started out well; why am I suddenly getting that nemesis anxiety showing up in the pit of my stomach causing my heart to beat faster

He's back &amp; the work week almost seems right as rain...which is a good thing in my world! Stay tuned for more updates as the day progresses

Hubby off to #yyc for the week to finish his studio build. When you are accustomed to having someone around 24/7, it's hard to fly solo!
I should still be sleeping; the last few nights when I have become restless &amp; look at the clock it is almost always the same time: 3:45AM :(
This #ManicMonday is a wrap for me; Sorry, but no auto-tweet-bot here! It's going to be a long week flying solo &amp; I need my sleep. Gd'Night!

I used to be able to tweet from my old #Blackberry #Bold in the evenings but it won't even let me do that anymore either most days #oldtech
"Every day man has a choice. Between going or staying; Between Love &amp; hate; Between life &amp; death. The sum of the choices becomes your life."

If you start a conversation, shouldn't you continue to participate or, at the very least, gracefully bow out instead of turning your back!

To continue on that thought, people never cease to disappoint me anyways, whether I set expectations or not. You just get hurt in the end...

#PSMyWords
Special dinner guest this evening is a beautiful #Riesling from @SummerGate paired with herb marinated chicken! Yum! 
Waiting for Hubby to pick me up at the end of the work day &amp; it's a long, long wait! Sigh, it's a never ending #ManicMonday :/
Still missing my side-kick and partner-in-crime; way too quiet without his giggles coming from behind me in our little pod world!

Visible this month! 
Obscenely quiet in my work area this morning...Trying to stay focused to slam through my work this morning and maybe have a lazy afternoon!

Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. 

Kindness in giving creates love.
