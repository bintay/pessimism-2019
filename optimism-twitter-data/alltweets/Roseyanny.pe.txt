If I have another day like this tomorrow....anyway have a fit Demi on me. Love her look here. Lush 
Just finished working. I'm s broken woman. What did I miss? Who snogged who? Fess up......

@parsnip45 @marksandspencer I sat down at dinner all evening. If I'd have had to walk / sit not under a table....I'd bright green pants on!
@raywade1 @marksandspencer in my knee?
@Lates worn twice! Walked &amp; sat in them Yknow WORE THEM
@parsnip45 @marksandspencer really annoyed. No receipt but going back with them. Not even 8 weeks old. £110 I think
@jillianhalfp @RobBlacksDesign ha! It wasn't tonight
@HeyBronte thanks lovely x
@Porntrumpet @DelightsSexy yes yes yes YESSSSSS!
Worn twice @marksandspencer leather trousers. Bought late March. Spilt tonight in 2 places...when I was out! 
@catbambina wire them! Home now. See next tweet
@catbambina worse
@RobBlacksDesign not ideal
@Zoetrope11 no!!! I'm fricking not. They are lined tho but I'm so annoyed.
...in case any of you clever sods come back with a weight dig.
And you can tell I haven't got a weight problem if I dared tweet that. I'm livid!
No. YOU'RE out wearing leather trousers for the second time THAT HAVE SPLIT at the knee &amp; crotch. FFS!
So I've worked too late for a disco nap. I'll be bloody snoozing at the table later :-(
@Vivienneclore @oakleighwatches @NeomOrganics I'm going back x
@Vivienneclore @oakleighwatches @NeomOrganics BOOM!! Really? I bloody went there today &amp; it did my head in! Thank you!
@oakleighwatches says you who peddle beautiful things I buy at great expense.....
@oakleighwatches @NeomOrganics erm yes &amp; then they wanted £40 for a candle WHICH I dithered about till the spell fail
@RojSmith idiots?
@oakleighwatches @NeomOrganics &amp; it was in @johnlewisretail !!!!
@RojSmith the candles were an olfactory sensation. But with bad spelling. No.
@Flosephine this thing....if it died I'd move. It's stunning
@Whendusksettles ha
@RojSmith @NeomOrganics &amp; as the candle was £40 it just, well put me off.
@Dr_RaulDuke sad state of affairs...
My clematis #boom! 
Hey @NeomOrganics sorry to break this to you but it's fragrances??? #fail 
@simoncdale @MelissaCole *waves* THAT LOOKS MANKY
@MelissaCole @simoncdale again I gag. My bro in law is Canadian. I'll ask!
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @Leatherbelle @octogirlscares @Littlebloodwolf love every detail on this. Hair sweep, tight near skin &amp; hands!
@FunkyColdJimina just chips but truffle scented / oiled &amp; ideally with a sprinkling of Parmesan. Not often I get them. Love an oven chip too
One thing I've learnt...we all like our chips weird. My preference. Truffle chips *DROOLS*
@jillianhalfp @StickyWalnut yak yak yak x
@James_L_Thomas see I can't BEAR gravy. In fact I'm vomming in mouth now
@In_cog_neat_oh I can absolutely tell you now I have never heard of one of them. Never???
@simoncdale @MelissaCole urgh - what's that.... I thought it was moonshine?
@murph_83 v funny x
But back in the day...a curried chip #mint
@In_cog_neat_oh I don't even know if that's right. So how do you?
Confession: I have never had cheesy chips &amp; I have to get that out there in case is spoils my image #truestory #GeordieShore
But @StickyWalnut don't think of fucking it up with any flash cheese. I want Iceland bright red shit smothered all over it x
@In_cog_neat_oh @StickyWalnut we have an amazing foodie scene in Chester. That's one thing we are spoiled with
Never mind the bloody amazing curry LOLZ nite...look at the cheesy chips WOWZA x  
@In_cog_neat_oh @StickyWalnut never ever ever had 'em but standard northern after lash food. Plus special exotic meal later so obvs bantz
Surprisingly enraged at this. WHO APPROVES THESE CLAIMS? Surely alarm bells would ring?  
Big decision of day: when is best time to ask @stickywalnut if they do cheesy chips (orange gloop cheese only) as a side with curry later?
@Donkomaniac I have no idea; was just listening this morning thinking
Tonight out to dinner. Did you hear that? DINNER? @StickyWalnut. On a Sunday? With booze &amp; LOLZ &amp; BANTS &amp; then my I've 6am gym alarm Mon FFS
@FunkyColdJimina @Hughes87N &amp; me...Smash Hits...
@Zoetrope11 ha! Appropriate then
@FunkyColdJimina @Hughes87N she is isn't she? I'm still sleepy in bed!
@Hughes87N I did not know that! You always come up with the answers! Clever gal x
When you think about it Joy Division was the worst band name for the type of  band / music they were
@TheWiganKebab @pablopictura see! Twitter is a thing of pleasure. I love your music taste. You love my lass taste!

@Tomwatched @RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles it's less strong than wine or cocktails. See now I feel worried!
@Tomwatched @RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles it's 5.8?
@Tomwatched @RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles beery not berry though it's cherry....oh you get my meaning
@Tomwatched @RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles and can we lose the word ale? Coz that makes me sound like a hefty hairy berry woman type?
@Tomwatched @RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles it's not strong. That's why I'm drinking it.
@rutherian @xolaurencexo I'm obsessed with her &amp; Richard Burton. A true true creature of immense beauty &amp; sass x
Cherry beer @Whendusksettles @Tomwatched yay x toasting your bums &amp; legs x 
@BaltiPie1 *keeps schtum*
@BaltiPie1 too busy being the spanker to be the spankee....BABY
So now we're #Labour #chester #cwacelection2015 - do not let this city sink lower. Lived here 13 years &amp; its slipped badly. Deliver ok?
@In_cog_neat_oh I nearly keeled over. Was instantly in agony! Jeez
Me? Of just eaten some wasabi that have given me a goddam embolism. I have never ever wanted to cry in an instant like it. Mother FUCKER
Ergo Twitter?  

SATIN NUDE 
@RojSmith oh aren't you.

Just paid £185 water bill. I rarely bitch about stuff like this but that's ASTOUNDED me
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @jesuisperdue48 well don't you agree??
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @jesuisperdue48 god I'm SUCH a detail freak. No. Hate the shoes. Look like cheap brides shoes. Garb = tacky.
@talioop what can I say to that! At least you train petal! X
Today's #lycra. Feeling fit but shoulder baaaaaad. Always abs on Saturday though. I LOVE abs.

@In_cog_neat_oh @PandaGothEyes imagine....
@PandaGothEyes @In_cog_neat_oh not the ideal match....but what do know
If I was Kate moss I'd light a fag, crack open a bottle of Pommery &amp; just watch Twitter feeling the love we have for her. Must feel amazing
@PandaGothEyes @In_cog_neat_oh laughing at this little vignette. I can't imagine you 2 together EVER x
@TheWiganKebab you have THE best music taste Sir!

@Holtehero1980 I have a step in my bathroom I sit on. It's as I never had a Brownstone NYC pad.
@Whendusksettles love the bum. But as I've a shoulder problem bind me in that &amp; wow will I yell x
@taffyfreeburn wen can you delete that from my TL NOW?? My eyes....
I am so so tired &amp; verging on just sitting on this stoop in my bathroom tweeting &amp; ......snoozing
@taffyfreeburn I'm a little old skool. I like talk dark men &amp; hairiness? Though I don't seek it out I don't like manicured men.
Thinking Sean Connery has a pretty much perfect body.
@TheWiganKebab uh-huh yesss
@sashadaisical snarky cow. All done! *curtseys* x haaaaha #sassmouth
@sashadaisical glad all good in your world. Always keep a sneaky perfectly eye lined eye on you x
@sashadaisical fraught with work but bring it on. It'll pass &amp; then I'll slam Chanel COZ I'm WORTH IT *looks to camera like a dumb modell*
@RobBlacksDesign better than ham face
@artichokebistro I know your meaning goebbels
@sashadaisical it wasn't a great choice but I liked it! How's YOU darling? X
@sashadaisical #yourmom
@RobBlacksDesign I think so yes. Well groomed
@sashadaisical yes! preen. I thought Roksanda. The back was hmmmm..... Hi viz?
What designer did #samanthacameron wear? Anyone know?
@BRl____ I just like a good rant!
@GBH68 what the hell do you mean that's main &amp; dessert. Fishfingers was a 'bar snack'
@BRl____ oh. Ha! That's cool to know. I'm mostly annoyed though
(Won't look quite so smug in gym tomorrow hanging)
Cocktail Bingo. Number 2. Fuck you *smug face* 
@BRl____ &amp; of course thank you...
@BRl____ whatcha mean?
Next up. Another huge cosmopolitan &amp; a good old sneer at rejected politicians. #MmeGuillotineisinthehouse
That WAS a cosmopolitan. I guzzled it GUZZLED it I tells ya. 
@kevbrackenbury ha! Errrr ok. I have m&amp;s chunky fish fingers!
@BRl____ as always
@CharlieTaters finished now....
@CharlieTaters bovvd
Still working &amp; hate my life. Starving. Cold. Miserable &amp; must've done 60 hrs this week. I look like an extra from Les Mis. Bleak
@MaldwynDobbs but it's not...
@In_cog_neat_oh it was only a wish. I can't. Driving 5 ish....&amp; well we all know how rigid I am with rules. Grrr
Is it too early to put wine in tea cup on desk? #notaskingforafriend
@Holtehero1980 oh. #nonethewiser
@Holtehero1980 well yes. I'm setting the scene. And who is mark draper?
...basically I needed a work moneyshot to make up for all the fluffing I've done &amp; now it's not gonna happen &amp; I'm...deflated
Bruiser of a week &amp; a few of deals I thought were hot have collapsed. So i've eaten a mini twirl instead of my finger &amp; now I loathe myself
Though #balls? Ffs
British politics RAZED to the ground.
@kenpeace #gone
I can never ever forgive #Labour for #blair &amp; #brown NEVER. I don't believe you're a bad man at all #Miliband but too many spectres.
Place your bets #Miliband
Such a tranche of politicians going but y'know what GOOD. From wastelands grow green shoots. Folk innovate &amp; regroup #election2015
I have little sympathy for politicians that resign or lose seats. In the real world workers try &amp; if we fail we go. Not a shred of sympathy
Yay #Farage gone? FUCKING SILVER LINING THERE....
So same old shit. They're all lying, robbing, denying fuckers anyway. Another 5yrs of trying to make a living for us all. Back to square 1
@RobBlacksDesign long, damp sweaty hair = head banging in kitchen YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG
ACDC YESSSS! MORNING ! My morning sweat done. Let's crack Friday
@neilonanhst that's the thing labour dos throw everything at it! Fascinating isn't it?
This week more than ever thank FUCK it's Friday *pulls Lycra reluctantly on*
*crosses fingers, scrunches eyes &amp; toes up in bed &amp; makes a wish....hoping I'm not gonna awake to any major UKIP success* FACE

Won sommert at last.
@RobBlacksDesign @LivillaSanders she's sussed you
@LivillaSanders liv I PRAY so too
@Tomwatched @LivillaSanders CRUCIBLE OF CUNTS. Brilliant !
@LivillaSanders I hate loathe &amp; abhor #blair &amp; every single bastard that sucked up to him &amp; upheld him as a good man. Sorry....ha!
Getting annoyed. They're all pissing me off. Bullshit punditry after bullshit smuggery. Mrs Miggins loving being in a boys' pissing contest
&amp; you can fuck off you smug #Blair bum licker #campbell
@carpsv2 shithouses
@Woodywizz ....innit that should've been...
@Woodywizz all over UKIP in it
56% turnout #SunderlandSouth? Bloody shocking
#Sheffield is that McLovin' #bbcelection
@RobBlacksDesign @LivillaSanders oh I didn't mean that YOU!
@LivillaSanders make mine large
@saraclmurphy not told anyone &amp; won't either!
@BRl____ thaaaaanks!
@craftsBoy see I KNEW you were a mole!
@craftsBoy you're scaring me....
@craftsBoy are YOU a pollster?
@BRl____ good point
@murph_83 no I AM! You can get behind me in the queue
So pleased the one 'good' outcome of this could be that the #Miliband brothers are mates again. Do FUCK OFF
@murph_83 22k! I mean REALLY?!
@BRl____ well soz to sound like a pundit - but we'll have to see but I'll fucking emigrate if so
@craftsBoy oh god who are you? Alan Sugga??? It's a rip off pal. None of them left the office. Duped'
*fucks off to be a pollster* #ukelection2015
@BRl____ UKIP obvs
@craftsBoy but I would too. And they CHARGE for it! Way to go #easymoney
I love this. Harriet Beecher Stowe. A favourite #quote when I tire of fighting &amp; a reminder of a city I love #Boston 
Said this before #polls amaze me. I wouldn't tell anyone who I voted for as its PERSONAL. They charge for invisible information surely?
It had to happen .....#AndrewNeil 
@GBH68 oh no - I concubine is a elegant thing IMO. Erm more slattern. More sailor slag?
Andrew Neil looks like Mrs Miggins - all dyed hair, rouged &amp; powdered up. Like a C18th prostitute.
@Bex_Sharp never a truer word spoken
Sara Smile *melts into bath* @jowhiley
Freezing tonight &amp; a little low as looks like I've a shoulder injury. Rotator cuff. So succumbing to a wine &amp; slinking off into bath
@Dr_RaulDuke so sorry to massively disappoint.
Beautiful. #Sieff #photography 
@GBH68 never heard of that!
@4ndrewJames ok. I'll try &amp; remember that. Bizarre!
@4ndrewJames erm no I rarely eat chocolate but that sounds awful !
@GBH68 what's a ciroc?

Is anyone staying up to watch  #Election2015 results coming in
@FunkyColdJimina I'm mint!

Isn't it a lovely warm feeling voting. Empowering. Historical &amp; so important. It's a solid pit of your tummy 'this feels right' feeling
@jmcc66 they need to mind me *stomps*
Gonna trade mark that @Whendusksettles @Tomwatched The Rosey Ass *high &amp; tight* <COPYRIGHT SIGN><REGISTERED SIGN><TRADE MARK SIGN>
Speaking of arseholes I'm off to #vote
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles well you're learning fast....
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles who'd say no. As long as I go first.....*blows on fingers*
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles LOVE THIS ASS! Perfect.
I'm downing tools for 90 mins of brutal yoga. Kill. Or. Cure. Gagging for it
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @geopolitikal total euro totty x
@jillianhalfp you too. Poor ha! All we can do is think another day another dollar x
Can't recall ever working this hard. Ever. Getting older sucks ass. I just want to lie in a field in the warm sunshine &amp; look at the sky
Me right now.... 
Off to shake my Money Maker, line my tired eyes with cat flick eyeliner, try &amp; feel amazing &amp; make money.....
....so now you know....
...&amp; another thing. After centuries of drinking 1 tea every morning just realised I can't face tea WHILST having food. Must be first.
@Tomwatched @Bex_Sharp I'm sat not very thrilled to be up just like that .....no rest for the wicked too
@Tomwatched @Bex_Sharp *grumbles over porridge* I'm so tired today :/( morning
My flower arranging. #skillz 
@Bex_Sharp @Tomwatched Claire's accessories *tuts*
@pedroban5 no!
My throbbing bleeding finger woke me during the night #FingerOfShame
@Bex_Sharp see? Not a loser by any stretch. Ridiculous waste of money but worth it!
Meant to no one IN PARTICULAR on my TL right now *whistles &amp; kicks stones* 
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N less artistic &amp; historical but makes the point..... 
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N I'm a gonna block your medieval ass.
@James_L_Thomas man y'see
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N and yet you introduce us all to lovely things like this....
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N rob you always go TOO far! Does your friend do those painting too?
@RobBlacksDesign @Tomwatched @Hughes87N it's lovely it really is!
@Bex_Sharp 432
@Bex_Sharp ohhhhh #judged
@James_L_Thomas no. You should recall as I'm sure you must be glued to my every word
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N the depth in this painting makes me want to gently touch the water....lovely!
@Tomwatched nah!
Someone knows SOMEONE #seasonalnailvarnishgate
@Hughes87N @RobBlacksDesign I follow them too Rob *yawns*
Twitter, recall when I separated winter nail colours from summer? You were ALL involved? Where'd I put my 450 bright colours? WHO HAS THEM?
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N CHARMER
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N get lost
@Hughes87N too late. Now in that awful panic 'I have to rip this wet plaster off' sweaty top lip moment
Lost that much blood water red. *exaggerates* BUT FUCK ME I'LL NEVER EAT A PART OF MY BODY AGAIN
Finger throbbing a la Tom &amp; Jerry. Bed. Remember kids....if you don't #vote tomorrow to be honest you're a spineless twat.
Think Borderline is a great Madonna song.
I did snigger  
@Woodywizz no I don't have water pressure issues. The bath is 4ft deep!
@Zowrr @Woodywizz  oh. *blocks both*
@Woodywizz ....plus can't afford it!
@Woodywizz it takes 1.5 hrs to fill. That's 15 mins. I'm like in 3 inches of water: can't be arsed with the deep water
@mrjohnmacleod I know. Scenes
Worst thing about eating part of your own finger is imminent bath time / tooth cleaning. And taking the plaster off.

@Midsomer_Craig I'm stressed &amp; anxious so I obviously bit a chunk outa my finger. I did that. So no I'm clearly mental!
Hey @Tomwatched Betty Boop

I yearn for a life without an iPhone glued to my hand. I have no choice. What do you yearn for?
@4ndrewJames &amp; actually phone boxes were dirty things.....
@In_cog_neat_oh don't you get bored of being positive? I think it's wretched to be positive all the time. So bloody tiring. How do you do it
@4ndrewJames can't disagree. Phones rule my life. And love the word jamboree (don't junk what a j bag is though)
@In_cog_neat_oh hello *grumbles*
*turns on massive rain shower &amp; heated floor &amp; Sonos music system*
Mobile number still not transferred *grinds teeth*. I hate modern life. Why can't I be living with Laurie Lee in Cider with Rosie?
Nice pic! @ShitChester that's pre races throng isn't it? *groans*
@mainlymarco ha! Like your style. See like everything these days they draaaaag it out. Thins the plot. Sadly not a chance for Fr Ted :-(

The amount of fuck offs I could Tourette's off my tongue tonight could make a Sailor blush.
. @O2 look-it's all your fault &amp; no point trying to make this right. I rang sat morning &amp; was told about the times. It wasn't ACTIONED!!!!
Fed up with shoddy service from @o2 &amp; should invoicing them for my time &amp; looking at working till midnight tonight. Too much gang.....
So I've been quiet: at breaking point with work. If anyone else says to me feast or famine....
@GymWankers_ @cstraordinary knob
@Tomwatched @Heysexylolita @Whendusksettles it's a yes from me
. @O2 you know what...me too then I won't have to speak to employees that don't go their job
@neilonanhst @theJeremyVine to be fair I normally listen happily when in car but that article was lower than fluff
. @O2 yes. I was told that today. I was also told it Saturday. And it wasn't so - go figure how confident I am!
Discussing the name Charlotte with Charlottes? Really? @thejeremyvine
. @O2 saying sorry is all you guys do. It doesn't help. Your treatment of customers stinks
@O2 can you explain why this would happen? I'm so so angry with you?
@O2 yes! You've confirmed nothing was done with it.
@O2 I'm so angry &amp; upset with you. Your customer service stinks
@O2 called you Sat lunch &amp; gave you my PAC code....tho spoke to you no one actioned. Disgusted. I run a business from moby. Congrats idiots
@JasonLeePatrick @O2 no choice. Not able to send texts from my office via @ee. Been 3 weeks of hell but @EE definitely better customer care
@JasonLeePatrick @O2 it's a saga:left O2 after 10yrs 3 wks ago. Went to @EE &amp; unexpectedly no home signal &amp; I work a lot at home. Gone back
@JasonLeePatrick @O2 I wasn't even asking for that. I gave my PAC code. That's all. Just rotten to the core.
@JasonLeePatrick @O2 I spent the time calling &amp; she didn't do the one thing she said she'd do. Can you imagine if YOU did that?
@O2 this is for you &amp; your shit shit service  
Fucking shit day delivering bad news to the sweetest of men &amp; @O2 not doing their job. The fuckers. Sat crying already
You know what the way we get treated by phone companies appals me. Just livid. I call. @O2 don't do their part. Utter crap
HEY @O2 NO ONE BOOKED IN MY TRANSFER THOUGH I CALLED SATURDAY. I'M SHAKING WITH ANGER! NOW ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT A MOBILE - DISGUSTED
I have never ever ever hated anything this mobile phone issue I've had. I'd rather clean toilets in a bookies than go through this again...
Way to go @O2 - sit on hold then get cut off...
@RyLee89 I used to entertain in the grosvenor on the night. It was disgusting!
@RyLee89 stop STOP!! You'll put me off my porridge
@RyLee89 &amp; the lasses that walk BARE FOOT?
@RyLee89 it turns Chester into a slime ball
@RyLee89 I hate the Races....
@In_cog_neat_oh why thank you but I KNEW!!
@In_cog_neat_oh none! Especially Duran
@In_cog_neat_oh @BBCR1 yes!!
Looking for signs that my day will go well &amp; Rio #duranduran helps!
@libertygal72 for both of us it is...
&amp; still not on old mobile number. On a randomer. So before I even do that awful job on hold to bloody @O2 asking when it'll transfer
@savology worried since Friday about it. I just have to deliver &amp; hope he agrees with the path I've chosen....gonna be a shock
First job of my day: at 9am deliver bad news to someone I care about &amp; lose oh....several £1000 in the process. Tummy churning already
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles MORNING
@nrm1972 enough!!
@artichokebistro I guess SORRY.....
@Hughes87N great minds Nik xxx
Ok. I get it: not my style. Let's balance out the light...bringing a bit of darkness back..... 
@Hughes87N God actually sorry x
Apologies for being motivational.
@GBH68 fuck no
Eaten crap food? Don't tomorrow. Drank too much? Stop tomorrow. Skipped fitness? Get off your ass &amp; do it tomorrow...simply be a better you
&amp; y'all know not into motivational shizz BUT I believe very much in every day turning over a new leaf: so this 
@mrparsley @kevbrackenbury @jamesbwxm @Andy_tabberer just like the rest of the fat....cats?

@Zoetrope11 ha! Well you never know...
....&amp; Annie's Song? If he hadn't gone fucking around in silly small planes he could've laid down beside me forever instead of kiffing it
...which incidentally I think is THE best snot scene committed to celluloid. Agreed?
Annie's Song: 'let me lay down beside you.....let me always be with you....' *sobs through snot a la Juliet Stevenson in Truly Madly Deeply*
@DemonArcher1 I will thanks for recommending
@carpsv2 @TheFlywaver but it's so pretty???
Loving this #Sheffield6Music day / weekend. Just a brilliant celebration of quality music with some top northern accents!

@TheFlywaver haha! Can you imagine?
@rutherian they must be ARGHHHH!
Love it when famous folk tweet angry tweets &amp; clearly the organisation must be FRICKING bricking themselves what to do @achrisevans #panic
That last tweet. If you're into #yoga, read it &amp; watch how you'll smile....it's pretty bang on.
@RobBlacksDesign it's a thought. I'm too tired to bother with any career decisions. Still under throw on the sofa wowling &amp; tired.
Noticed a wire poking out from my underwired bra which has KILLED me all day. Now can't wait for bedtime to rip it off &amp; bin it #joy
@carpsv2 it's a 'once I wear it I'm binning it' look I give you that....
Had enough. Quitting my own business. Resigning. Sticking it to THE man. You can go find another me to work like a fricking navvy......oh.

@Wiltalk haha. I've been working you Dutch Devil......
@VexSlain &amp; this my adored dark one is why you &amp; I will never be Queen! Mouths. Opinions.
@VexSlain it's actually sickening. Why should we a) admire &amp; b) not see through the HELP she has &amp; the pressure she's under.
@Wiltalk well. You know I don't go on about EVERYTHING on here. A gals gotta have some secrets....
@jesuisperdue48 @Tomwatched @Whendusksettles I have a thing for her too. How could you not.....?
@Wiltalk how the fuck do you know.....?
@VexSlain I haven't see enough rage on here for that 'show' of perfection. It's wretched

@F1Dope it better not be as.....guess what...I'm bloody working....

@RobBlacksDesign that's how I feel. Deep into it
@fotofill i'll try &amp; shape up after I promise
@NicknotasuKnow I know *looks wistfully*
@RobBlacksDesign no you don't. I do. One not leading to corporate life....

@retctubdratsab working too hard. But it's all I do so its ok! In good! Freezing up north tonight tho. Honeymoon? Where?

I don't *get* boxing. I wouldn't pay £1 to go. Am I alone?
@Wiltalk you louche creature. Lucky you. Honey? Can you imagine the mess?
@Whendusksettles @RojSmith *smirks*
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles you heard it here first....
Ok finished work. A sneaky effective 2 hours. I'm cold. Haven't got a scrap of food in &amp; am gagging &amp; I mean gagging for alcohol. Laters
@Whendusksettles love that we said almost the same thing....
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles I had nice things said for free so that ain't NO SALE!
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles ahhh CHARMER. Thank you ;-)
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles errrr *scrabbles* see my Lycra pic earlier? That's photoshopped to make me normal...*phew*
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles nah. Me &amp; Dusk have longer legs.....
@RyLee89 I had to go &amp; sit in kitchen to even talk on phone. I'll suffer the Chester poor signal not here
@RyLee89 yes. No signal in Chester city &amp; I'd had enough but no signal at home impossible. Texts haven't been going, I've lost calls etc
@RyLee89 @O2 all I can say is that it's been impossible to use my phone. Unable to even work in the room I've used for 10yrs with O2.
@RyLee89 it did the last 3 weeks!
Back on O2 in my office with 5 SEXY bars on moby. Had 1bar for 3 weeks with EE. Unexpected &amp; unforeseen &amp; what a hassle: could cry with joy
New Sim going in. I'm going dark ops. I shall return a new woman &amp; if I don't. I love you all *throws kisses*
@EE resent going back to O2 where I was for 10 yrs but I'm stressed when my mobile rings as no one can hear me/get cut off. V disappointed
@EE thanks but been onto for hrs over 3 weeks. Customer care been good but your signal unworkable in my home. Texts stick. No signal.
@Tomwatched @missnikki696 @Whendusksettles nice to inspire such sumptuousness x
@taffyfreeburn thanks (I think)

@deanbennett85 I cannot believe I need to go back. I'm exhausted by the whole thing. SIM card on my desk &amp; can't bear the thought of it all
My last follower. Why?
@rutherian that never happened. It's EE. Been thru the diagnostics. They admit my house is rubbish
@rutherian I've never ever had texts not go. These days 2 out of 5 don't.
@rutherian yes. Don't even DARE say it cd be my 5s. I never ever had a prob anywhere but Chester city with o2.
@jmcc66 no. No breaking in. #gohardorgohome
@jmcc66 that's dead right. I live in an area of poor infrastructure &amp; this country is lagging
Haaha well done @ModernToss 
@O2 no it's fine thank you
@jmcc66 no. Make no mistake it's an agonising punishing massage. Nowt twee
@jmcc66 but the surprise is that so far unimpressed in EE. Much poorer signal everywhere I've been. Weaker. I work a lot in car. No good.
@jmcc66 I left o2 aft 10yrs as no signal in city. EE have no signal in my home. You couldn't make it up. Lost calls. Texts don't go
Right a 2 hour massage. Get in!
@oakleighwatches oh bravo !
Y'know this @EE thing baffles. Lost a call 3x in car:some of you told me they were ace bt later I'm back to @O2. Overall 3wks-rubbish signal
@oakleighwatches *looks suspiciously* JUST THEM???
@oakleighwatches you or them?
@oakleighwatches @ThetfordGC such cute dogs Giles
In a bath &amp; it's like winter today. Freezing.
@rutherian *BLUSHING* well I never take the easy path. And s'pose it pays off eventually. Thanks x
@rutherian thanks so much! What do I always say...I work hard....
Babies born. Young wives die. Life can be so happy &amp; so sad. All at once
@Bex_Sharp Haaaha! I never assumed.....
Feeling the love from you lot today. Thanks so much for all your kind Lycra comments. C'mere &amp; let's have a big, deep snog. Tongues too x

Can you imagine the pressure? Ann Boleyn: poor thing? I feel pressure to have a good hair day:not deliver a live male baby for a raging King
Sitting thinking of all Queens in childbirth that lineage, royalty, king &amp; country depended upon to deliver THAT male child.
@Holtehero1980 if Jason statham sent me a bunch of flowers I'd send them back. Always think thick idiot. Just my opinion...

When a woman at 60 is hot that's wonderful isn't it? Or am I lusting after her car &amp; if she was in a Renault i wouldn't have noticed?
@BaltiPie1 every time. I never get tired....
Sat next to an 'older lady' in a soft top Maserati &amp; I can honestly say she's totally beautiful. Must be 60. I hope I look like that at 60
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @altdel5 oh really?
@Holtehero1980 yes. I have too much work so avoiding Mac / phone &amp; office. Just trying to zone out for 20. Nowt exciting
@Tomwatched @Whendusksettles @altdel5 well you nearly didn't get one after the #buttongate incident yesterday
@Holtehero1980 yes. I am.

@Woodywizz eh? I don't get it?
@NNpme Urgh URGH
Cuff links. Faffing with cuff links on a crisp stiff cotton shirt. Argh. How do you men bother?
@NNpme I know. We're all at the coalface x
@NNpme thanks for those lovely words. I'm still sat in sweaty gym kit into O2 - I'm already behind! X
@NNpme *sobs*!
&amp; sat here waiting for O2 to open. Yes kiddies it's that nightmare again. PAC code going over. Even thinking of it my heart races
Daunted by work today. Sat just daunted. All weekend ahead &amp; I'm working. Dunno where to start....
*shakes money maker*
This morning I could weep I want to skip the gym so bad. Soooooo bloody tired
@duguzzle he always comes across as eviller than Hitler. (No such word I know but you get the evil picture)
@duguzzle I'm slightly obsessed with how utter evil Goebbels was. Fascinatingly so. Great programme
No shit. I try &amp; remind myself of this often.  
Twitter I tell you this: last week I caught a slight tan. I am in bed with Garry. My hot water bottle. Freezing
Fuck off charmer #bbcquestiontime

@RobBlacksDesign whaddya think? Read the bio baby!
@RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles ok. Why aren't you sure about ankles &amp; I'm not gonna be flippant as you I guess must have a good eye!!
@Whendusksettles @Tomwatched agreed! Pretty good!

@Tbone_STEAKS I don't believe you
@kevbrackenbury sorry dropped off there.....
@Tbone_STEAKS EACH TO THEIR OWN !
Apologies for the dullest tweet I've ever bothered to do
Dunno what they've done to @thetrainline website but it's clunky &amp; stupid. There's a pop up for return pricing that just won't move
@uncoolestgirl Birthday Snogs Yo x
....my tiny hands are frozen...I always have cool hands &amp; feet, even though usually too hot. Weird (this is me musing it loud via Twitter)
@GBH68 isn't it cold? I'm huddled by a heater &amp; I'm always too warm
Freezing today. Bloody freezing
@Tbone_STEAKS really? That does surprise me!
@Zowrr yup
@Andy_tabberer laughing in kitchen at that. PRECISELY
MORNING FROM YOUR DARK LITTLE RAY OF SUNSHINE
Anyone that goes looking at cars they can't afford in a field &amp; spaffs over them can never be a friend of mine. Harsh but fair.
Once you get through the headline acts on this Car Fest announcement it should be called "Where Acts have gone to Die" #TumbleweedFest
@RobBlacksDesign god you are so obtuse. Goodnight you awkward man!
Well that was Wednesday. Immense. Night nutters *scrunches toes up &amp; does the biggest sleepy contented stretch EVER*
@RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles you could have an army of female fans out there hanging on your every tweet. To be fair doubtful....
@RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles well you tweet? Commanding language of a fashion. &amp; how do you know you don't? Ahhhhh. You don't do you?
@RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles *tuts* YOU can't think that surely? Someone wrote that for someone? You're teasing?
@Whendusksettles @langleav very fond of her. She really nails it. As @MichaelFaudet does. I know you tweet them too.
Lovely lovely words @langleav 
@kevbrackenbury Haaaha you TART. Loving the hashtag
@kevbrackenbury I thought I'd marry john Taylor. Obvs

Can't argue with that.... 
@Cockers_ @PandaGothEyes can't wait. Book deal next

@oakleighwatches @Bremont *sneers at phone*
@Woodywizz harsh.....but.....
@Cockers_ @PandaGothEyes #mumoftheyear YOU WIN x
@Tactless_Blonde @PandaGothEyes ha. I knew!
@charleybarley20 Urgh
@charleybarley20 yeah but the lack of peace.....
@PandaGothEyes Haaaha. Dead right I s'pose.
I reckon being a parent of a youngish child must suck when its your bath time. If anyone interrupted mine I'd be furious. How do you manage?
Best use for a good club I've seen.  

2. he’s useful… 
@oakleighwatches @Bremont is that SNOW??
@andy_brown4430 yes! Exactly that!
@mrparsley who has time please?
@RedMark71 #boreoff
Recently had a bunch of new followers who tweet but don't interact. They don't *look* like bots but why would I follow you if you just spout
FINISHED *yells &amp; slides under hot bubbles whilst fist pumping*
Such a shame the #election &amp; the #RoyalBabyWatch couldn't go on for another few months.....said no one ever
@RobBlacksDesign @Hughes87N nice. I'm searching for one online though &amp; seem to be struggling!
@RobBlacksDesign I knew darling. I was only teasing.....
@RobBlacksDesign no carbs till marbs hun.
Welcome back tuna out of a tin for lunch &amp; peanut butter on everything.
Been a long time since I burned the midnight oil at work with NO LUNCH.....but those days are back again. Yay *big cheer*
@Donkomaniac it's been like 1987
@Donkomaniac I couldn't have guessed it. Nor then &amp; once thru customer care good but often 1 or 2 bars on phone at most. No good
@Donkomaniac EE. No home signal. Lost calls. Texts don't go.
So off back to O2. You couldn't make it up. Wasted wasted time, effort &amp; prob cost me £100's in misplaced energy.
@madmunk @Vader_chops you've thought this through.....
@madmunk @Vader_chops doubtless completely authentic with the temperature &amp; the dust.
@Vader_chops @madmunk if she's anything like me she'd have her own!!!! But i take your point Cowboy
@Vader_chops @madmunk my Dad - a Clint maniac LOVED her &amp; you can see why! So no. I'd be no fair maiden.....she's more my style!
@Vader_chops @madmunk whilst we're on a theme feast your eyes on the best harlot in the Wild West:Claudia cardinale 
@Vader_chops @madmunk nope. Women are still women
@madmunk @Vader_chops Harlots! 10/10 pal for that expression!
@Vader_chops @madmunk I'm not fair.....haaaaha!
@madmunk @Vader_chops AND GET THE HELL OUTA TOWN....*winks cheekily*
@jkdan a red Indian. I have the hair
....modern life FUCK OFF. Cowboy TAKE ME AWAY.....
Modern life can go fuck itself today. Keyboard sticking, sitting on hold, phone ringing, you answer = miss vmails, new PAC code to give over
@Nc999 sadly yes.
Someone just posted a picture on Facebook of MINT AERO ice cream cake &amp; I can't unsee it. What a wretched thought.
@Holtehero1980 no I switched from O2 but ee have the worst signal at home &amp; it's been a nightmare. Getting pac code now to do it all again!
Here we go again #onholdtoEEwhenishouldbemakingmoney
I want to be wearing Cassini on Capri with a handsome tall man when I hear this song....On Days Like These Matt Munro
@andy_brown4430 i'd agree
@RobBlacksDesign tell you what is beautiful. My silk pillowcase....NIGHT!
@RobBlacksDesign fascinating
@RobBlacksDesign I mean - you're the expert - what do I know?!!
@RobBlacksDesign totally &amp; it becomes gilt overload but as its steeped in such history &amp; the city matches it...it all works. I think
Versailles was pretty beautiful too @RobBlacksDesign
@theBlueObject *blushes* .... same to you x
@RobBlacksDesign This. Chatsworth. I think. That's a GREAT question &amp; I could probably think of more. You? 
@RobBlacksDesign no need for sorry - just illustrating &amp; mirroring your point
@RobBlacksDesign it makes me WANT to touch flesh. It's urgent &amp; sexy but cold &amp; grabby. Yes. It's beyond art.
@RobBlacksDesign this is what I said last night 
@RobBlacksDesign ....'yes I've seen it' ha. Ok sorry to bore you. Looking good in that pic too
@theBlueObject well I'm still here &amp; that marble still wows &amp; you would know wouldn't you? Mr Sculptor.
@RobBlacksDesign do you not see this? I tweeted it last night &amp; all day today ALL DAY folk have RT etc. Bernini 
@theBlueObject well HELLO! Get you popping up!
Again. The Bernini. This is how I feel on my bed right now. Love. My. Bed. But look at that marble THAT MARBLE....

@kevbrackenbury ahhhh AMAZE thank you &amp; I'm not grumpy I'm officially PISSED off x
Here's some Perfect Pop music to ease your day:)
@Roseyanny 

@RobBlacksDesign @Whendusksettles Haaaha!  
Now THATS my kinda photo &amp; body. Lovely, realistic form &amp; tone. Love her  
As usual in the wrong place for yoga. Mindset is one of rage, annoyance &amp; I'm cross. Mediation can do one too.
@mrparsley you live &amp; don't learn ....
@mrparsley me too x
@mrparsley what a waste of time but I couldn't know
@mrparsley gone thru all diagnostics - too weak a signal. I'll trade no signal here for Chester: its imposs. Got to sit in kitchen to talk
@mrparsley yes but not coming out till 11th &amp; I lost 2 calls today + texted 2mins ago. No signal. Didn't go. When EVER do you get no signal?
@mrparsley @EE it's unforeseen &amp; I'm at the end of tether as you know I lost work number the other week too. Hey ho
@rutherian remember i have the worst home broadband ever. One of 52 houses with unreal speeds. I'm fucking sick. Just slinking back to O2
&amp; that call to @EE took 49mins &amp; dept was closed: can't fault service when thru. It's like I'm back in 1995 with calls / signal. Bad luck me
Ok to answer....leaving @EE after 10 days. Been through all the diagnostics. Signal at home 2G. Txts don't go. Back to suck O2 dick. Gutted

Body painting

yeah, I know ...

*Life ebbing away whilst on hold to @EE* face. COME ON GUYS, get the bloody phones
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles ha! See Twitter yet again comes up with suggestions &amp; ideas.

@RojSmith @Whendusksettles ahhhhh very good Sir
@Whendusksettles @RojSmith Haaaha! Then he lies as his hands will be cold!
@Whendusksettles @RojSmith Haaaha! Depends on how warm his hands really are! It's cold in Cheshire today!
@PaperHegemony like
Smupple  (noun) denoting a  'smug couple'. People in a relationship who are too proud of themselves: #cunts
@RojSmith @Whendusksettles that's a plus!
@Whendusksettles that image MAKES me want to do that right now. Right now! I make no apology for saying that. None.

@fightingpants @southportgal @cosmicgirlie I know. 23. That's a gift
As I'm reasonably fit, people do ask me if I've a marathon in me &amp; I say yes. By yes mean I mean fuck that &amp; no. Not ever. Hideous idea
@nrm1972 @ephemeragrrl innit

@ephemeragrrl @nrm1972 lovely to hear. Twitter lends itself well to photography &amp; 'bites' of info doesn't it?
@nrm1972 @ephemeragrrl isn't it? Bernini. I've tweeted it before as its simply amazing. The touch is....well it's just there isn't it?

@SteveKnight7 I believe it is
@Tomwatched yes. I'm cowed by it.
I look at this pic regularly with astonishment. How HOW did he make marble more supple &amp; tactile than human flesh? 
@Webbo_init @VexSlain @JasonLeePatrick I read that VERY shouty in my head. Why I wonder?
@Webbo_init @VexSlain @JasonLeePatrick &amp; letters...letters are a forgotten art &amp; they are much missed. Anyone who writes is a keeper x

@madmunk I'll try but....can't promise
@meganmoorhens @Furryous1 Kylie - to me - is a botoxed small childish thing. Not sexy at all. So I'm fussy too
@icreamhorner ha. It was too far tbh
Errrr @MattRMBlake @Bex_Sharp I prefer a more 'made up' Eva 
@meganmoorhens @Furryous1 see I don't get Kylie. To me no sex appeal at all
@MattRMBlake @Bex_Sharp Bex already tweeted me &amp; approved
@MattRMBlake @Bex_Sharp crack on
@meganmoorhens boobs though?
Well done to my bro @Wowlywilly who has cycled 149 miles in 2 days for #Christies #Cancer. &amp; all us sisters can ask is how sore his bum is!
@kevbrackenbury no funnier coz I can't eat tom or jez
@meganmoorhens I cannot understand that! I can't! You're brunette too? Laughing as so bizarre !
#EvaGreen wow. 
@charleybarley20 thank you for that appraisal &amp; I admit I do work hard at it. But  letting go is hard. I have bloody high standards!
@Andy_tabberer never read any. IMO boys stuff
@jmcc66 you'll be in court in days
@charleybarley20 haaha. Ben &amp; Jerrys darling. Fat article that I am
@jmcc66 ya think?
@icreamhorner perhaps too naughty?
@JeSuisUnDan yes! That's the thing!
@RobBlacksDesign casum??? I see your point with gash but casum?
@jmcc66 standard pal
@jmcc66 ha. Shhhh
WHAT A SUNSET
@jmcc66 oh I vaguely have construction connections &amp; I'd say it's only slightly changed *sniggers*. I'll say no more
There are better Bond girls names than Sylvia Trench surely? Next it'll be Margaret Slurry? #DrNo
@jmcc66 she was soooo willing though (I mean who wouldn't be with that big tall chap flirting) but just remarkable how things have changed
@kevbrackenbury I love them !
Can you imagine sitting on your secretary's knee feeling her up? Jeez Bond is so dated.
Bond. James Bond: yessssss
Sean Connery #DrNo. I fucking would.

I'm on the Campari, the Barolo is open, truffles scent the kitchen &amp; I'm having a steak in 20. I couldn't live without wine. Or steak.

@In_cog_neat_oh not even going to deign to reply to this.
....which begs the question how many women actually ASK for dick pics?
So Twitter: followed by a right cocky lad. 7 Dms later-all ignored-he asks if I'd like porn sending but won't send a dick pic 'unless asked'
Astounding. In my home not one fuck will be given. 
Read the last couple of sentences. LIMES? No insult strong enough. #gwynethpaltrow

Had a nightmare - a genuine one - was stabbing &amp; being stabbed by women &amp; I've woken all upset with the sound of slashing knives in my ears

The peace &amp; calm &amp; colours of the water, sky &amp; sun are so special tonight 
This has been such a lovely walk. I'd have taken more pics but the amount of dog shit I could've stood in was so stressful #thisisengland
I'm at west kirby. Just the most amazing clear evening. A stunning day &amp; a glorious end to it. 
Now THAT is a car (bet you read this in a Jeremy Clarkson stylee) 
How mint is this view? 
Some twat unicycling along the unguarded sea wall. Just had to force my arms rigidly by my side my mischievous thoughts were so strong
God it's gonna be bore off Yanny with all my pics. Sorry 
Lovely evening!

Today I feel so blessed.
God #katiecutler you angel x
And why Nicholas Witchall? Do fuck off you old royalist
@Zowrr see?! I remember when a little 'jog' was daunting
@Zowrr look at you with your 'oh just a 5k' x
@madmunk dare I ask why?
@Zowrr no words. My phone says the next 12 days rain after tomorrow too.
@pasteyh2g2 atta boy
@madmunk they are tuppence to buy. Go forth &amp; purchase
@mrparsley phew or I'd be in trouble for tempting....
Oh god a child. Why? I was all peaceful &amp; now a kid.....
Not you @mrparsley <SMIRKING FACE>
@Holtehero1980 yeah but it's not fixing the sleep issue
I urge you folk of the working world. Book an emergency pm holiday, get bikinis - or budgie smugglers - on. It's glorious. Act. Now.
@Holtehero1980 what a bizarre answer!
@Holtehero1980 erm. I don't understand what you mean? What on earth does drinking loads of water do?
@Holtehero1980 urgh poor you!
@GBH68 #squeaky
@GBH68 I don't believe that!!
....&amp; he's absent mindedly playing with his tummy button. Urgh
....so hot a tattooed guy next to me has taken his shirt off. Jeez. Men
&amp; soz to state obvs but it's really hot out here!!!
@Holtehero1980 why haven't you slept?
Standing next to a guy with a heavy New York accent on his phone. Soooo Tony Soprano. I love a strong, identifiable male voice.
@Holtehero1980 what - you're jaded? What am I a daisy duke doll to cheer you up? Buck up its SUNNY!? X
@Holtehero1980 no. But skinny jeans &amp; havianas! No meetings today. So slumming it
@Holtehero1980 you'll never win this one. It'll just get dull how much I work. No hols? No lunch? So today - I'm off for a semi skive!
@Holtehero1980 oi! I can do what I want pal as I only made a deal yesterday due to working on Saturday ! So shuuuuut up!! Ha!
My iPhone weather says a stunner today &amp; tomorrow then rain for 9 days. So if you fancy a skive #justsaying
@Marc_Luther yup! See that. It's shite. Ps love your Instagram comment to my comment on madonna! Haaaha!
@sayitaintsojoe9 yeah you're prob right. Makes me wanna die
What's the point in music by #joshgroban ? Genuine question?

"It's not so vulgar now it it?" Liz Taylor to Princess Anne as she tried on her Krupp ring.  
@PandaGothEyes @VexSlain sorry ma!
@VexSlain @PandaGothEyes Ahhhh SHUCKS - I'll do s'pose *coyly kicks imaginary stones with hands behind back*
@VexSlain @PandaGothEyes you're both pretty fucking aces x
@VexSlain @PandaGothEyes howling at that howler
@RobBlacksDesign what? Played 'jolly good' tennis in antique clothes with an antique racquet &amp; then ate antique cream tea?
@RobBlacksDesign nah. He's fitter!
That's it. Leave me alone with my misery. Laters x
@RobBlacksDesign this could be you. But swathed in tweed &amp; silk fannying on with ceramics or summat. Try it! 
@RobBlacksDesign I've been doing it 8 months &amp; it's changed my core &amp; body shape slightly but mindset lots. Ha 
@RobBlacksDesign Haaaha! I love your crackers point of view. Yes! But then yoga makes you do other stuff whilst on back to complicate stuff
@RobBlacksDesign Haaaha! I love your crackers point of view. Yes! But then watch for what yoga makes you do *goes to find that pic*
@RobBlacksDesign keep practising. I'll come....*she tweets from bed*
Tonight's #yoga was hip openers. Doubtless unable to walk tomorrow. &amp; I tried this: I never got fricking close 
@RobBlacksDesign think you might be well practiced at that!
@RobBlacksDesign he looks more at ease than I did
@RobBlacksDesign yup. On back, grab toes &amp; widen legs. Whilst holding toes. It wrecks. Unsurprisingly
@RobBlacksDesign I've just done that pose in yoga! Just!
@In_cog_neat_oh no. It's personal. It's deep &amp; it's upsetting. I just need to sleep
No. Me neither 
@In_cog_neat_oh I'll be fucking fine tomorrow I just need an angry few hours OKAAAAAY???????
@In_cog_neat_oh no. Oh. You just did.....
@Etch32 boooo exactly
@RobBlacksDesign ha! That did make me smile. Who is that?
@Etch32 mines two grrrrrrs too x
Tonight. I'm so flat. Just that.
@FunkyColdJimina #melted
Gotta be a top down night on way to yoga drive hasn't it? Gotta be?
Unashamed to sack today off earlier than I should. Decidedly odd work day. Now. Work gear off. Yoga gear on. Gonna be a hot sess tonight
Today's work has been bizarre. A blip mid-deal made the whole think knife edge &amp; now I'm just relieved. Lost the joy along the way though

Realistic interpretation of #ReneMagritte  
"The Lovers II" 

THE LOVERS, 1957

First time I've had to talk to @EE &amp; impressed. Can you believe home signal is so poor. I can't win :-( but they helped me. Not hard is it?
@BintyMustard @Hughes87N @VexSlain she was just greedy. Plain greedy

Hello Saturday
@RobBlacksDesign @VexSlain @PandaGothEyes my disappointment &amp; that of the females of this great nation is palpable.
Night Nutters. It's been a blast. Feels cold in bed tonight. Keep warm &amp; summer please hurry....
@RobBlacksDesign @VexSlain @PandaGothEyes can you actually *get* any hotter? Belching &amp; stripping? #keeper
&amp; on a different note @VexSlain @PandaGothEyes walked into bedroom - just chucked bra across room. #standard
Pablo Neruda – Carnal Apple, Woman Filled, Burning Moon | Genius errrr @VexSlain @PandaGothEyes I already lust... 
@PandaGothEyes @VexSlain I admit to knowing very little about a) poetry b) ballet &amp; 3) modern dance. I feel poetry lets me down
@PandaGothEyes @VexSlain now I feel like a dunce
@catbambina anti Semitic. Nice
@VexSlain you know what. I will do. Gonna google in bed now x
@VexSlain I'm reading. Learning x thank you
@catbambina too short &amp; racist  (allegedly) for me but if I may be so flippant - yes. Rugged &amp; easy on the eye
@RobBlacksDesign lost in the mist of time....yes I've noticed
No no NOOOOOO!  
Oh @VexSlain I admit to being quite ignorant of poetry but have come across some only v recently.....so thanks for sharing all this x
