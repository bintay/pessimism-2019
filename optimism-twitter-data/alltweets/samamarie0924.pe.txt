It's literally so impossible to watch a movie with fucking megan <PISTOL><PISTOL><BOMB>
Those dumbells really just refuse to love me <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Lol totally still not a fucking weights person <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And whether its been a while; or we've had a falling out, Whatever it may be I promise, I'd never not be there if you're in need.
I honestly love when I get those "are you up, I need someone to talk to" texts. They make me smile. Make me feel so trusted and loved<HEAVY BLACK HEART><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I hate the feeling of being replaced

Someone come watch movies with meeee <UNAMUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
Sometimes I swear I have like no friends lol
So 0f course everyones gonna be leaving when I'm coming. That makes me sad <PENSIVE FACE>
My whole family spent the day with each other, while I was at work.
And my friends are lame af an won't come <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Knew I should have gone to the gym before work. Now I have to go late af.
I can't wait to get off work and spend the rest of the day with my beautiful mother and the rest of the fam <PENSIVE FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Fucking rocket power for the winnnn
Sylvester Stallone is pretty much my nigga <RAISED FIST>
Just literally saw like 20 of the sexiest trucks ever.. like one after another. Shit wtf am I missing <NEUTRAL FACE> lol
It's even worse when it's someone that's close to you, someone that you care about ya know
You can only do so much though. You really can't help someone that doesn't wanna be helped
Knowing damn well that someone has a problem and not being able to help them, really upsets me <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
My hammies are not happy with me today lol
Some people just blow my fucking mind. Smdh.
@belizabethhhh I have to love him though. Lol
@belizabethhhh omh he was being such a little fucking shit. I really thought I was gonna punch him in the face.
@belizabethhhh ew. I look terrible here. Lol
Hate all of this.
I could never hate having a big heart but sometimes it sucks because as big as it is, that just means important things hurt you10xs more.
I'm trying so hard to do better for myself and change, for the better. And it really hurts when people try to bring me down about it.
Like that's not funny, ever. Wtf is wrong with you?
Seriously, nothing makes me more angry than someone mocking another persons death
Oh wow..
Blah blah blahh.. <DISAPPOINTED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
When you notice that your mom has been commenting on your friends statuses, telling them they're grounded... like what? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Snap chat really pisses me off sometimes
I wish sleep just loved me as much as I love it
My bed feels like I'm pretty much floatin on a mfin cloud rn <RAISED FIST><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SLEEPY FACE>
@SnowbunnyStarr you'll get back too! But good I'm glad, anytime <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I feel fucking dead rn
@SnowbunnyStarr yass too yummy. I'm tempted rn lol how are you recouping from surgery!?
@SnowbunnyStarr omgahhhh, why must you do that too me <WEARY FACE><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TONGUE>
@paigetrich I'll have to look at my schedule but I'm sure I can figure something out!
So, just saw the snap of you dancin on the table and then the car door @paigetrich and I must say idk why but it pretty much made my day<INFORMATION DESK PERSON><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Thats the worst feeling ever
And the first person you think of telling or talking too about it is no longer there to do so
The shitty feeling you get when something major in your day and or life happens
I wish I could tell gramps all the things I should have but never got too.
If only heaven had visiting hours, I'd probably be better than I have been.
My favorite thing to do on days like these; sit in the driveway just staring at the stars.
Blood ain't always family. Family ain't always blood.
But unfortunately it doesn't always work that way.
And if never touching it ever again would bring all that back, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
I've lost so many special, important, dear things because of alcohol
Mean angry and cruel and that's just not me, at all.
Fought with so many people about how it doesn't make me a different person when in fact it absolutely makes me a complete different person
If I'm being completely honest, I hate what drinking has done to my life over the years
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile
It's an important thing, saying 'I love you' to the people that matter. You never know when you might lose them, or when they might lose you
You will have too many angry mfers after your ass. Too many to count. I promise you that. Lol
And if you like living, stop fucking harassing them. Don't ever be stupid enough to threaten them again.POS.
I'm gonna say this in the nicest way I can, stay tf away from my family <ANGRY FACE>
I really hope everyone is extremely safe tonight.
There's always something going down,
In this nothing town
It ain't all just porches and plows, don't let that one red light fool ya
<WEARY FACE><GRIMACING FACE><GRIMACING FACE>
#sorryboutit loll
On the real tho. I'm grumpy af.
So ready for bed.. <WEARY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
Theres so many people that have come into my life and just inspired me, my mind and my heart. I so badly want to be one of those people.
To the gym <WEARY FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Sosas snap story Is the best ever. I'm crying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
These two literally have me speechless..
Jordan said.. "yo do we need corn or do we need soy sauce " <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Everyone's drunk af..
I feel so uncomfortable here
Never let your praying knees get lazy and love like crazy
Be a best friend, tell the truth and over use I love yous
Im gonna be completely honest with you. I just wanna get high af rn.
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
Light up the night and let it burn, lean back and watch the sun down fade
Tomorrow's deed. Finally switch gyms . I really can't stand pf.
Mentally, physically and emotionally drained
The last thing I ever wanted was for you to hate me.
And it makes me sick to my stomach
I'm a very understanding person. But all of this, I don't understand one bit.
Happy fucking monday
Not the way I wanted to find out my bestfriend has been sitting in jail. Wtf.
Forever and always.

And idk how you could. But that's just me.
I'd still never beable to speak bad about you. Or negative in any way.
People always leave.
Wow. That shit hurts.
That's so aggravating
Don't just asume you know wtf I'm doing. If you're really worried about it, try asking me.
You know its a bad idea when you hear "hold my beer" or "hey yall, watch this" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
"You're talking about it turning into a shitshow, well guess what welcome to our shit show. You ain seen nothin yet. ." <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
All I'm thinking about rn is foood
From the songs she plays, to the prayers she prays
A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down, mama taught her how to rip up a town
My shins, booty and legs are not very happy with me today <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Bria is being no help with motivation today. Lol
Just gonna make me wanna work harder. And I will. Say what you want but Im not giving up on this, regardless of what anyone says or thinks.
Like, For once I'm bettering myself. Doing good for myself and you wanna bring me down for that? Why? That's shitty.
It's actually pretty sad and discouraging, how some of my friends just can't seem to support me in finally doing better for myself
Lolll sometimes I wish people would be there for me like I'm there for them.
Nights like these got me all flustered and shit
I couldn't think about anybody else right now. Even if I wanted too.
Hahah I fucking love my mom
Hooters and my bitches are waiting for meee <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Can it be 7 already
Cowboys and angels
You're gonna look stupid af in court thoooo
I don't think I've ever been so freakin livid
That's gotta be a fucking joke if I ever heard one.
Are you fucking kidding me!?
My legs hurt. So fucking bad.
@SnowbunnyStarr Aww, you're too sweet. Thank you. Will do <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@SnowbunnyStarr sure as hell is. The worst.
And that sucks more than I could ever explain.
That's really the main thing that hurts the most. I feel like I've lost one of my best friends.
The number one thing I really hate about all of this. More than anything, I really just miss my friend..
To be quite honest..
To sit on the driveway, on a gorgeous fucking night like this, smoking a blunt, having a deep ass conversation would be absolutely perf rn<WEARY FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
I made a snap, So people would know the exact vicinity to look for me. Just incase I got kidnapped <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Cause when the pain of stayin the same outweighs the pain of change, I'll probably change my ways
Or some kind of self defense class
I wanna take a boxing class.
It's fucking draft dayyyyy
And for when I think I've lost my way, there are no words here left to say, it's true. God gave me you <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
OR I'll just go by myself, cause everyone's being lammmme
Lol so fucking cute <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Someone come to the gym with me tonightttttttttt
He was so proud, funniest shit I've ever heard
This 51 year old bouncer that came into my work literally just made my whole day <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> straight to the point with him lmfao
I mean, it is what it is.
One of the hardest things in life is figuring out which bridges you should burn and which to cross
If you're ever feeling alone or like you can't talk to anyone, don't. Because I got you. You know I'm always here. Any time of day or night.
Yas 
I'm just not interested in anyone else, that's just how it is for me rn. Really don't see that changing anytime soon. So you should stop.
I mean I'm sorry, but <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Omg. <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Briaaababy love youu toooo <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Got my heart racing like there's nothin to it, fallin in love to the beat of the music
Never gonna grow up, never gonna slow down. We were shinin like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock showwww
Oh hey 3 am thunder storm <WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

I'm starving <WEARY FACE>
No shit 

Lol yeah. Keep runnin your mouth.
I really don't care what happens now and then.. as long as you'll be my friend at the end <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
That's totally, fine I'll go get food by myself. Fuck everyone else lol
Someone come get food with meeee
I guess I just work differently than others.
I'll never understand that.
How could you tell someone they're your best friend and then treat them like garbage.
Everybody could see the punchline comin, a mile away
The jokes on me but it ain't funny
Somethin’ ‘bout a man on a tractor, with his hat on backwards, lookin’ forward to after he’s done <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Pool time bitches, come ovaaaa
My anxiety today <PENSIVE FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
I need someone to replace my break light for me tomorrow <UNAMUSED FACE> can't catch a damn break
Idek what to watch on netflix anymore.
Kind of gets to me 
Despite everything, I still have more love in my heart than most think they have in their mind. Thats what separates me from anyone else.
Can't do this to myself. It's so unhealthy.
I can't understand why you're treating me like this. And it hurts.
I just really need a friend right now.
My heart hurts. So bad.
Oh wow.
You can't force someone to care about you. In any kind of way. So appreciate the ones that do and the ones that don't have to try.
That moment you hear compliments from 3 different people on how they can see the progress you've made already with your body. Hell yeah <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Gonna go see shitlor at work and then I think, go get my tattoo drawn up. Someone come with meee. #teamnofriends
Emotionally, mentally and physically exhausted.
Like why. Wtf
Never want to wake up to that nightmare and this song at the same time again. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I just gotta tell you baby, tonight looks good on you
I just want to go back.
Is it bad that all I want to do rn is call you, just to hear your voice and tell you exactly how much I miss you.
Too cute to get on my last nerve
He said "I want you to go, because all I want for you is happiness, even if that happiness doesn't involve me anymore" omg he had me balling
Omg no more romance movies <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
You ain't gotta wake up an miss me no, I hope get lonely tonight
She ain't into wine and dinin,
She's shooting whiskey singing sweet child of mine,
She ain't hard to please, long as you got speed
Brantley gilbert just does somethin to me. He can make me super happy or super sad. Lol
Yoooo, let's go to the perfect cup in matlacha an get breakfast <WEARY FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Someone should get tf up an pay attention to me cause I'm awake now <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I'm that friend you can call at 3 am because you need to vent and know for a fact will answer.
Things will happen as they should.
It won't be like this forever
You melt me like ice an whiskey, with those blue fame looks that you give me
Ever been so into somebody,
You're still lying there when it comes back up
You ever watched the sun go down, 
From the bed of a pickup truck
Watch all the girls hate  me
Drive em all crazy
I just wanna show you off
Do what I do when life's a little side ways.
Lean back and watch the sun down fade
Light up the night an let it burn
Had all i ever wanted. An lost it within minutes.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
Got me reminiscing on them good times
Them ol' dirt roads, is what y'all missin'
Tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
I miss that shit. Those were great times.
Then sitting around a fire
Startin when the sun came up, stayin all day, gettin stuck and all muddy.
I miss going to the woods with everyone
It goes perfect with your eyes yeah, tonight looks good on you
Somethin' about that southern sky,
Sitting back behind that moon
"Life of the party" by jake Owen is my shit right now..

Yes 
But apparently there's nothing left to fix.
On my grandfathers grave, I swear I'd do anything and everything to fix this.
This day is gonna be hard af to get through. It already sucks, there's absolutely nothing good about it. Not at all.
And now I'm just gonna sit here and smoke this bowl<OK HAND SIGN>
I just really don't want to feel like this anymore.
So alone.

I'm perfectly content on where I stand right now. And actually for quite a while. Thanks for your concern though. Lol
I don't need to "mingle" with anyone <UNAMUSED FACE> lol, nor do I intend too rn but that's just me. I guess people just deal with that shit differently.

- sexuality 
- height 
- gender 
- skin color.
As long as you respect me, I'll r…
I really really really just want to watch the lion king.
Omg yas lol 
Like, I'll give you the best damn advice I can, about anything, regardless my feelings toward you. That's just how I am, always will be
I'm there for people as much as possibly can be because I know what it's like to deal with things alone.
I just walked in my room and it seriously looked like WW II in this bitch.. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

It's to better my life an to better me? So why can't you just support me with it? Like tell me your proud of me or somethin. Be happy for me
I wish some of my friends would be more supportive about me wanting to, not so much change myself, but improve myself.
I just want to be there. Be a friend. Because everyone needs one. That's all I'm trying to do. And im constantly getting nowhere with it.
Haha yeah we'll see lmaooo
Decided I'm gonna become a stoner again. I'ma build up my tolerance again, and just out smoke everyone <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But I don't do no half ass, only come around when you need somethin friends. You're either all in, or not in at all. Simple <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Especially the ones you have a bond with, that no one could break
Friendship means so much to me.
But like I said, everyone always leaves.
Or to beable to go from talking to someone everyday, to treating them like they don't even exist
It really saddens me to see how fast people can change their feelings. To go from meaning everything to someone, to absolutely nothing.
That's seriously so exciting to meee
Yasss! Down 20 pounds so far!? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I have my moments, everyone does. But imma stay humble till the day they put me in the ground<RAISED FIST>

Anyone who motivates you to do better for yourself an make positive life changes, to better you. Those are the ppl you want to keep in life

I just have a really bad feeling.. and I'm not sure why
Omg my car.. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I'm freakin tf out
It's really quite unnecessary to stare through a window like that.. lol
Just doesn't make any sense to me
Idk
Sometimes all I do is think of the worst and that's killer.
I just wanna have intense, deep conversations and cuddle an watch movies all night <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
