@itsHadeelwbu so I can relieve you off your misery? I'd rather not :D
@itsHadeelwbu They don't even exist yet and I'm already feeling bad for them
@itsHadeelwbu And your kids will wish that they were adopted instead
@itsHadeelwbu Well the former is inevitable. And when you do have kids I'll tell them how their mother didn't want any one of them.
@itsHadeelwbu Not looking forward to have kids or committing suicide?
@itsHadeelwbu Doesn't matter. You better get used to dealing with 'annoying kid' or you'll commit suicide once you have your own!
@itsHadeelwbu You'll be a bad mother
@aphroditaeng HAHAHA

@itsHadeelwbu mhmm okay I hope you are ready to go to jail. Not only because I'm blaming you but also for screwing the recipe
@itsHadeelwbu don't worry Im the one who's shop lifting yallah whats the ingredients
@itsHadeelwbu fine, tell me the ingredients then I'll steal them and put the blame on you
@itsHadeelwbu You're rich lah you get the ingredients and make it
