With the biggest caveat being that Dier is/will probably become our best centre-back, this nails it. He was bad. 
@Jamieda23625108 Nearly every side uses inverted wingers these days...
@GaffneyVLC And yet he never applauds the fans - always straight down the tunnel. He's great on social media, though.
@GaffneyVLC @SebSB @uMAXitFootball That, again, can feel like a deflection away from himself.
@GaffneyVLC @SebSB @uMAXitFootball The only 'fight' I've seen is personal battles where he can get quite angry/nasty with opponents.
@SebSB @uMAXitFootball ...on the goal line, etc, felt quite sulky to me. Almost passing on the responsibilty.
@SebSB @uMAXitFootball That I totally agree with. But I feel like he's just been a bit passive a lot of the time. Sinking to his knees...
@uMAXitFootball @SebSB @Spooky23 He was this way before his sad personal trauma, though.
@SebSB @uMAXitFootball Can't help but feel if he had a bit more fight in him, then he'd 'make his own luck', as the cliche goes.
@SebSB @uMAXitFootball I've found him quite 'weak-willed'. @Spooky23 nailed it early on when he referred to him as 'apologetic'.
@sam247 @mattpotton22 @daleyjones1 I've had an awful season in FPL! Once you get behind you start taking stupid gambles and it spirals...
@d_murphy84 Me either!
@drewmoores82 Totally agree, need some strength of character.
@AintNoSanAn @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 I'm being facetious of course, but Sherwood was not as bad as many say (although he was bad).
@AintNoSanAn @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 Like... with the amount everyone goes on about Mason being unsuited...was Chadli in CM so bad?!
@JOrtiz45 Tired, broken, 'low' players.
@NYSpur Ha - great line! What a performance.
@DavePointing I don't like him :(
@Mark_Lynch1 Yeah, loads and loads to do.
@SarahE68 Yeah, there have been some brilliant moments!
@MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 @TheM_L_G If we can get Milner it'd make so much sense. Homegrown, experienced, versatile, 'good lad'.
@MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 @TheM_L_G I like Ki too. Incidentally, anyone know why he hasn't always started recently?
@LouJayne1882 @RobbG2B Me too. I agree with substitutions even less.
@jelleman1973 We need to see a lot of positive changes early next season to get some hope back.
@LL3D @jair1970 Me too.
@TheM_L_G @MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 ...(I realise it's hard to imagine now that he's a natural scorer!).
@TheM_L_G @MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 Yeah, been thinking the same for a while. Pressing energy, inventive passing, goals...
@MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @TheM_L_G @jair1970 ...better, but Capoue is definitely not a potential answer in my eyes.
@MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @TheM_L_G @jair1970 I totally get that our current midfield doesn't work &amp; a 4-3-3 with anyone holding would be...
@MC_of_A @unfitforpurpose @TheM_L_G @jair1970 We lost 6/14 when Capoue started right? He's not a good player.
@RichArrowsmith Yeah, seen it all so many ruddy times.
Now I can't wait for the season to end and the re-building to start. Clear the decks. It feels like Pochettino needs a fresh start.
It's really sad how quickly the season tailed off. Just a few months back it was *so* much fun. I was really enjoying being a Spurs fan.
@TheM_L_G @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 Maybe, but we definitely had some better defensive games. Recall United at home being one. Stambouli?
@PDXSpurs @brettrainbow Sorry, my comments weren't related. I was just musing generally.
@TheM_L_G @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 It didn't last long, mind.
@TheM_L_G @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 But we could see that they did. It was fairly obvious.
@jair1970 @unfitforpurpose @brettrainbow How about with Stambouli (small sample size!)?
@SmuggieMike @unfitforpurpose @jair1970 That's exactly how I feel.
@Shemothy @SpursFanVA @CoysNews Yup, been saying it for weeks.
@aledvaughan @JaiP72 I think he only has 14 or so players he trusts.
@brettrainbow Yup, both were horrendous. TBH I think Vertonghen's had another poor season generally. And Chiriches was Chiriches. Sigh.
@unfitforpurpose @jair1970 Yup. But there's no doubt we *did* start improving after a few months. Before going bad again!
@55thVin @brettrainbow Yeah, absolutely no doubt that he'll have way more good games than bad in future. He's a terrific young player.
@Mark_Lynch1 Our three behind Kane have been poor for much of the season. And our defence/defensive-midfield has been poor too!
@JaiP72 I don't agree with that. I think things will improve drastically with fresh faces and pre-season.
@CoysNews Yup, largely agree. But we could have expected more signs of improvement even with current squad.
@thfc_tommy @jair1970 So much work to do!
@jair1970 Yeah, I feel much the same. Think the key defeats in short space of time totally broke spirit &amp; it's been downward spiral since.
@king26ledley No mate, I wasn't watching tonight. Look forward to seeing tomorrow!
@JME_Watts84 Yeah. But he has a lot to prove.
@Benandthebuses @ForgottenLibero It's probably a bit of that. Just totally broken by what happened in that period.
@AlanWindham @jair1970 Yeah, but it's as much a structural thing as an individuals thing.
@Ben_Rosenthal @jair1970 Exactly the same for me.
@thfc_tommy @jair1970 I think once he has his own players and a pre-season, we'll see a big improvement.
@CarlItAsISeeIt @KingSRV @THFCacademy Ah yes, I remember now. Cheers mate!
@TonyBoxall Sounds wonderful. My parents have just relocated to Somerset so I've been enjoying South West too! Where are you in Dartmoor?
@brettrainbow Somehow feel like Bentaleb's going to get a shoeing too. His worst performance of the season, unfortunately.
This is quite a scary read if you're already a little concerned about our lack of progression under Pochettino. 
Terrific celebration from Maghoma! 
@brettrainbow It'd actually be a tonne easier for Eriksen to track him since Mason has to turn. But it's just horrible from everyone.
@brettrainbow I'm not sure it is fine to press him. So much wrong with the whole move even before Mason fails to get back into position.
@OfficialBroseph @brettrainbow Equally, we've seen pressing in some games and not others so maybe the message is just totally messed up.
@brettrainbow ...then Mason is the only one following instructions and he's being mugged off by his teammates. We'll never know.
@brettrainbow And also - the point I made last week - we don't know what the instructions are. If told to press in these situations...
@AintNoSanAn Yeah, he really stood at at youth level as a technically gifted star. I still think he is, just being asked to play diff role.
@TonyBoxall How are you Tony?
@crazyivancnd @Gingertfc @TorontoHooligan It's inevitable. He'll be involved in pre-season &amp; we'll take it from there I think.
@DavePointing You reckon? I'm not convinced.
@WelhamOfficial @YiddenAgenda Shame it's The Sun, mind...
@Gingertfc @TorontoHooligan @crazyivancnd Hello! What would you like to know?
Proudest day of my life. My Vlad song went mainstream.  
@YiddenAgenda Holy heck fire, where was that?!
@YidoBuckler Generally plays centre mid which explains why he's so comfortable on the ball!
@therhinospeaks He could be a Jay Rodriguez style wing forward...
@fatfish59 Just seen it - wow!
@THFCacademy @KingSRV Seems to score every week!
Wow! Well worth a watch: our U16 player, @JRoles8. 
@J_Warshaw16 Winks or Onomah I'd say. Or Ward / Veljkovic if they are eligible.
@Ashleychittock To play alongside him? Too similar?
@Colum11Scott @Adebayored @pokeefe1 @GaffneyVLC @HotspurRelated @TalkingTHFC No.
@charlieparrish @geoffgosbee Nigel De Jong. But he was poor in his last season at City.
@andyperry79 @charlieparrish I think his slowness is exaggerated, doesn't look that slow to me.
@andyperry79 @charlieparrish @djrattigan I have heard from numerous people that whilst he's friends with them, he trains very hard.
@charlieparrish @geoffgosbee In both cases we'd have to really sell them project &amp; tell them how important they'd be. Make them top earners.
@charlieparrish @geoffgosbee Zabaleta has declined a little this season, get a price while they still can? Totally agree re: Milner.
@reevaldo80 I don't rate him myself.
@KingSRV @THFCacademy Thanks! I've seen Skipp in the Riga Cup matches, looks very talented. I've probably seen TJ to without knowing it.
@KingSRV @THFCacademy Are there any names that we should be looking out for? TOB &amp; Kirby aside.
@THFCacademy Drop me an email address and I'll send you what I have :)
@THFCacademy Great work with appearance details! Did you do this manually? Must have taken ages! Do you want DOB for each to add in?
@journeymanhisto Started writing this. Might make it out today, if not maybe tomorrow evening.
@no1jib @BenPearceSpurs He'd be in our top 5 players easily. Probably top 3.
@charlieparrish @geoffgosbee Would have been ideal. I'd love Zabaleta (who also played with Poch) and Milner.
@charlieparrish @geoffgosbee I made this point a few weeks ago, people seemed to say they think he'd be perfect blend with NB. Not sure.
@charlieparrish Me too. Can't believe we've not tried Stambouli alongside Mason and Bentaleb.
@lazythfc I'm sure he'd say that, but it's not likely...
@Walts_88 No thanks!
@Nathan_a_clark Yup, almost certain to.
@CalumRogers Milner makes loads of sense if we can get him.
@HotspurFC82 DM. But he can play either.
@laggers82 Loads to do.
@BenPearceSpurs Absolutely essential this summer. I'd love Zabaleta (who played with Poch) and Milner.
@BainsXIII Yeah, no doubt.
@BobbyCoys Ha!
@Nnnnnathan10 We've been linked. If that happens it'd be a last resort, I'm sure.
@charlieparrish Just seen this from Dec 2014 - both of our points pertinent now! 
@JackIngleton Agree with both statements.
@MeCrazyMatt @WelshSpur07 Argentine connection, too. I'd love Zabaleta (who played with Poch) and Milner.
@LiamoCOYS He wasn't great in his last season at City. That's my concern.
@NacerLADli Milner would be fabulous but I doubt he'd come to us. Richards is a no from me.
@SimonJ68 @Billie_T @WelshSpur07 @adamdnathan Presume you've all seen the 'ITK' about Cain Hoy lurking again? It's done the rounds today.
Friedel, Kaboul, Soldado &amp; Adebayor are all likely to move on, or retire in Friedel's case. Vorm is the other in our top 5 oldest.
I hope we're in the market for at least one experienced player this summer, especially with 4 of our 5 oldest players likely to leave.
@WelshSpur07 @adamdnathan @Billie_T @SimonJ68 Hopefully that will continue! Agree re: a couple of older, experienced players.
@WelshSpur07 @adamdnathan @Billie_T @SimonJ68 Sorry to butt in, don't think backing's unlikely - could say backed already by getting PM in.
@Billie_T Carter on roids.
@Billie_T Looks like a Backstreet Boy.
@JME_Watts84 I'll take that x
@Boggo1 @tehTrunk @ebbp Only because I checked just now how many followers he has. Not enough is the answer.
@tehTrunk @ebbp He's terrific. His follower/following ratio makes me sad. People are missing out.
@paxtonlad It was horrible from the 10th minute on mate! Awful team performance and loads of individual mistakes too.
@SpursOfficial Oh how tragic. Thoughts are with Tony and his family. RIP.
@BardiTFC @TheloniousFilth Chicharito is one of the most overrated players in European football. I bet we sign him.
@therhinospeaks Ah nice one - I wanted to go but am dog-sitting for parents! Where did Roles play when he came on? CM? Hope you're well!
@adamp_thetruth @WelshSpur07 :) See you in August, haha!
@adampowley I totally get that. But the risk of doing that and ending up dropping down the league &amp; not being able to get back up is there.
@adampowley I meant 'not for relegating us' in the previous tweet - apols, just replied to about a million tweets in a row and I'm flagging.
@adamp_thetruth @WelshSpur07 Done. £20 to a charity of the winner's choice.
@SunnyYid @jonoblain That, and the extra games, and the lack of viable squad options.
@chris_coys He's acknowledged it this time, though.
@TheoYiangou @georgebann Well, he'll easily pay for himself in terms of the brand, and then he has some potential too so is a cheap punt.
@adamp_thetruth @WelshSpur07 I'd stake a lot of money on him not being here next season.
@adampowley We're blaming them for not taking us to the next level, though, for not relegating us, etc. We're stable but trying things.
@Witz35 I think it should have been 4-3-3 with Stambouli in front of defence.
@AlanWindham With who in midfield? I think it should have been 4-3-3 with Stambouli in front of defence.
@stroastertudel Agreed. Injuries aside it was just the same week in, week out. No risks on the bench either.
@arunspurs @alexclayton1981 System has fundamental flaws, especially against a 4-2-3-1, which most teams use.
@chris_coys Not curious enough. Use the EL to break the kids in and for the fans to have fun &amp; go to cheap matches.
@jonoblain @SunnyYid Yeah it would. Course it would.
@arunspurs Yeah, agreed. I really like Dier though so he's worth all the shit in some ways :D
@pietroboffa85 He'll have to.
@One_Club_THFC @TransitionTHFC Yeah, he's a wimp when it comes to the dirty side of the game. Can see why Denmark manager calld him out.
@DanielJPermutt Yeah, way too harsh. We were dreadful then! I think next season will see a big improvement.
@jonoblain @SunnyYid If you tested energy levels now compared to 1st day of season &amp; I'm convinced the results would be staggeringly diff.
@TheoYiangou @georgebann He has once or twice, but it's been rare. Wish he'd affect games more.
@dazradley @RaviJoshi94 Of course, famously so.
@TheoYiangou @georgebann I gather Yedlin's 'not ready'. Suspect he might never be.
@greg_jenner Lennon, Holtby, Khumalo (!) too. Maybe Townsend. Maybe even Fazio. Lots to do. Going to be a hectic summer!
@adampowley Levy gonna sack himself for, generally speaking, running us well (in a business sense, *sigh*)? That'd be nuts.
@opuszczony Me too!
@adamp_thetruth @WelshSpur07 Just from being told stuff, really.
@SunnyYid Most of the players arrived before Pochettino.
@greg_jenner We have a summer re-build to look forward to (!). Opportunity to make things right as we have decent core.
@adampowley Hence Baldini's gone/going. Mitchell &amp; Mackenzie will hopefully help improve things. Good appointments.
@finch_richard I think we'll build over summer and finish a place higher next year (and hopefully win a cup).
@Mafs42 Let's hope not!
@mcr_thfc Rose was slated last year. Kane was developing but his rise has been amazing.
@stroastertudel Christ, you're right.
@alexclayton1981 He is. We should be playing 4-3-3 to protect a tired midfield and defence.
@shawry_ozspurs Fatigue, confidence, motivation, tactics. All played a part.
@smith_gscoys Blimey. You're really not happy with Spurs are you? I am generally quite optimistic.
@nikk7 @DjL03 Oh did they? Interesting.
@spurs_tweeter Thanks :)
@RobSmartodds Yeah, you make good points.
@chrispaouros Just a total shit-storm from start to finish.
@gunshealy We gave it a go. Bad timing with the cup final made team selection tricky.
@arunspurs Apparently he's barely looked good even for U21s so I don't think we can count on him yet. He looked awful vs Villa!
@DanielJPermutt Yeah, I agree. Confidence sapped and a lack of strong leadership helping them through it.
@opuszczony I dunno, we should make a fair bit from Paulinho, Holtby, Chiriches, Soldado, Adebayor, Lennon...
@mtb5003 Absolutely right. Shame he's not tried a few more youngsters.
@chris_coys And then once we know I guess go back to being in it again? :D
@jonoblain @SunnyYid It's so clearly not an excuse *or* fabricated by fans, but I don't have the energy to get into it now.
@SunnyYid What do you use to explain it? 'Shit coach' and 'shit players'?
@pietroboffa85 Absolutely that.
@the_yid_ Spot on, heck of a lot to do in terms of both ins and outs.
@WelshSpur07 Apparently his attitude is awful.
@AlanWindham Yeah, did well. Missed Rose and Walker's natural width.
@on_wu That'd just be weird when he can just tell Levy as much.
@DavidBullockEdu If it helps, it won't last.
@nigelfox3 @jamescrisford Should certainly have played more - even if just here and there.
@greg_jenner Oh, that guy. He sucked.
@BenPearceSpurs I don't know how easy it is for you to ask post-match, but I'd love to hear why Pochettino hasn't used squad/youngsters.
@georgebann During games and between games too. That's what's annoying. Wish journalists would ask post-match.
@Keen_Hacksaw Partly because our fans are so short-sighted.
@IdentityJohnDoe He'd been one of our best players, out of position, in the previous few matches.
@finch_richard Another one? Please god no.
@fuck_schwab I wasn't trying to excuse them (I thought I'd made that clear).
@Ric_Aardo @stefanpape29 1. He wasn't. 2. Paulinho then had a baby.
@nigelfox3 And Dembele/Townsend could have played more too. Not to mention the youngsters.
@TopDiv Probably. But if that's the case, why not experiment a bit? Try out some young players?
@Mafs42 @KanKeano_OLBG Hasn't even been that high lately. Just been defending like idiots.
@joeyhnath Yeah, we really did. So many stupid mistakes! But there are reasons for them.
@mcr_thfc At Spurs? Rise of Kane and Rose. At Southampton? Pretty much everything.
@dgobs23 @bigraceking That'd be crazy.
@CaveWebster I like it.
@JeffG15563 Totally. Been saying the same since November.
@George_S96 It was working for a while. Bigger squad and it might work consistently.
@GaryRootbeer And that's why (the reasonable) fans are questioning him. I'm ignoring the unreasonable fans who are just losing their shit.
@bigraceking @dgobs23 Yeah, there definitely needs to be an improvement there.
@domsib Oh I see what you mean!
@domsib But yeah, agree.
@domsib He didn't bring Vlad in?
@siday09 Let's see what he does with his own players.
@RobSmartodds But they were fairly obvious ones to learn from!
@jcifelli21 Totally. Onomah or Winks in. Why not?
@reverse_ball What I was most excited about was a manager who could make us better than the sum of our parts. He hasn't (yet).
@RaviJoshi94 That's exactly it.
@kev_g1 Absolutely no chance.
@arunspurs I'm not sure Yedlin's the right example, but Stambouli/Dembele are.
@KevinMMathews11 Clueless is harsh but he needs to develop flexibility.
@stroastertudel He definitely, definitely needs to develop some flexibility.
@gunshealy I guess the q is: what do you want? Do you want us to finish 5th and have fewer cup matches? Or do you want 6th/7th but cups.
@Ric_Aardo @stefanpape29 Why on earth would you sell Mason, a homegrown player, who can be a useful squad member? Crazy.
@Neilo1986 @GaffneyVLC We've had about three or four players who should have played more.
@opuszczony Going to take some doing, isn't it?
@TransitionTHFC Indeed.
@BetBentall I do! I loved Florence. Want more away trips.
@daveyglee @Spooky23 Fatigue, confidence, motivation, tactics. All played a part.
@SunnyYid Fatigue, confidence, motivation, tactics. All played a part.
@DjL03 Not got the data easily accessible but I'd imagine so.
@Luckoflucienne I loved my Florence trip. Want another away trip or two next year.
@chris_coys My thoughts are: we'll probably finish 5th next season if we're out of it, and have less fun away trips.
@WelshSpur07 He's offski.
@FootballGogme Fatigue, confidence, motivation, tactics. All played a part.
@FootballGogme I thought I'd written the tweet in such a way that it was obvious it wasn't an 'excuse'. But it helps explain it.
@stefanpape29 Anyone tbh.
@TransitionTHFC Eriksen bottled about four challenges :( I thought he was dreadful.
@adampowley @no1jib Trusted to do a job which looked easy, but was actually very difficult.
@kev_g1 You're better than that, Kev.
@SocialDows 5 touches in 30 minutes :(
@SebSB Literally the only bright spot. I guess Dier's crossing too.
@king26ledley Nope, early on it was Fazio. But yeah, Dier had a poor game. Fazio made several major errors too.
@lee41watson Spot on, Lee.
@greg_jenner The last line got me! Eriksen, Kane &amp; Mason look ludicrously jaded now. Eriksen &amp; Mason needed taking out team weeks back.
@dazradley Nope, agreed. Been reasons for it all, though.
@_rdl007 Of course. As I said.
@finch_richard Blind as to what?
@CouvreFeuFire I wish I'd gone today in many ways. I couldn't make it.
@fuck_schwab Sponsored by what?
@gorskic :D
@jelleman1973 Sad innit?
@tomdavey88 Good lad.
@the_yid_ Absolutely. Wrote this a week ago: 
@JohnBrute Totally.
@paulkrarup I'd have to count. I'd guess it's 50-60. But they are 1. better and 2. have a squad their manager trusts.
@joeyhnath What's that mean?
@spursfantommo84 Of course it did. Fatigue, confidence, motivation, tactics. All played a part.
@George_S96 Not excuses - just part of a bigger explanation.
@Banburyyid But it helps explain it.
@fm_carv Haha!
I want the club to back Pochettino for next 2 years: I do have faith in him. But I also want him to show signs of learning from mistakes.
What's not clear: why we haven't made more changes as this dreadful run has gone on - to both tactics &amp; to personnel.
What's clear: our young side's spirit was broken by exit from Europa League, cup final defeat, Liverpool game. They're knackered and low.
@jcifelli21 They're totally burnt out now, confidence was broken by cup final, EL exit, and Liverpool defeat.
@GaffneyVLC Makes it worse! We've been given the run-around.
@gunshealy We're 3 league places better than them. Therefore only playing 76% of our matches is significant.
@M_C_Cassidy Of course. If I wanted to look for excuses I could find many more. Them playing 76% of our matches is significant.
@DjL03 If I wanted to look for excuses I could find many more. Them playing 76% of our matches is significant.
@chris_coys Ha! Are you a Europa League fan? I like it. Would rather be in than out.
@MattHoward123 If I wanted to look for excuses I could find many more. Them playing 76% of our matches is significant.
@JiroSpyro Yeah, we've wasted money. Hardly a secret...
@solly_mark Ha!
@Luckoflucienne I like the Europa League.
@FootballGogme What's weak, sorry?
@thejondaniels They've done even more running the last few games as the opposition have run rings around us.
@daveyglee @Spooky23 They're 9th place, 3 places behind us. They're not a bad team at all.
@the_yid_ He really did.
@TheSportsDean I hope not. Need to back him for at least two more years.
@adampowley @no1jib Baldini.
@Ric_Aardo You are such a cheery soul, aren't you?
@jake_meador @MC_of_A @jayjaffa @brettrainbow Ha! It'd be a real fun fest, that's for sure.
@SocialDows Chadli or Eriksen should have come off as soon as sending off happened.
@stefanpape29 He's been so bad, Stefan. Eriksen's definitely been one of our worst players over the last four months.
@SocialDows Yeah, agreed. Rose for Chadli for me.
@stuartlkearney He was one of few who tried today.
@stylishriot @Razorrico86 I have... he's starting to do more of what I want. Put this Lamela into our December/January team &amp; he'd be great.
@JamesBurf He was dreadful today. Has needed taking out of the team for some time. Needs the summer break more than most.
@Ricky11Slade Yeah, he's really let things slip away.
Well, that was fun.
@adampowley One of the few players to show any level of commitment. Didn't back out of challenges, for example (unlike some).
Of course it doesn't justify how terrible we've been, but worth noting that Stoke have played 42 matches this season compared to our 55.
Didn't agree with the second sub either - Lamela one of the few players to come out of this horrible match with any credit.
Chadli's the one I'd have taken off too, but Soldado? That's surprising. Rose or Townsend seemed more obvious.
@HarryBrooks11 I like him but he has a long way to go!
@FootballGogme @TorontoHooligan @rickydimech123 Most of his appearances have been as a 10.
@SingleMaltSuds @SebSB Exactly that.
@RobSmartodds Yeah, I agree. People have really turned on him and it's ugly.
@FootballGogme @rickydimech123 I think his best role is a 10 or an 8 alongside (at least one) defensive midfielder.
@FootballGogme @rickydimech123 He was an exceptional finisher at U18 level. A lot of that comes with practice &amp; confidence.
@smith_gscoys That's crazy talk.
@Bateseyboy I hope we get another year out of him.
@arunspurs @SebSB Yeah, but it's less obvious in a forward position and leads to fewer goals, so it's not so straightforward.
@Ricky11Slade I think he can, but they need someone in there to do the dirty work - tracking runners, making tackles.
@Univarn Experience, is one thing, I'd guess. Next season they'll benefit from it.
@tehTrunk @SebSB I guess with recent years of squad turnover it's what we've become used to. Main job of a Head Coach is to improve players.
Azzaoui scored twice (one pen) for Belgium U17s against Czech Republic U17s this afternoon. 
@Standard_Yid Good to hear!
@leebrown2 No chance of that.
@JaymesPayten Nope, some of his decisions do confuse me.
@SebSB Too true. He's actually done well at the other end today, two good shots and some progressive passes/movement. But that's ignored.
@OlyLister @SebSB I think he's good enough, but he needs someone alongside him who does the dirty work.
@AlanWindham @SebSB That's an exaggeration but he's had a poor month.
@JiroSpyro Issues have equal weighting for me.
@benfranksthfc That's what I've thought for a month.
@drjimmy12 Alongside him otherwise we will lack creative passer and support for forwards.
@RobSmartodds Me too.
@gbewing Yedlin? Really? He'd get so badly bullied.
@TheSportsDean That's the the thing that makes you question him - that we've seen it before, many times.
@DavidBullockEdu Definitely a bit of that.
@AlanWindham He's a good player being asked to perform a role which doesn't get the best out of him.
@rickydimech123 He's a good player being asked to perform a role which doesn't get the best out of him.
@PeerVanDerVaart I think that's slightly harsh but both are better with the ball &amp; need someone to do the dirty work in there.
@Oedipus_Lex Difficult to tell whether he called or not but it was poor.
@jonnypollock Yeah, neither he or Bentaleb are good enough defensively (yet).
@James_R96 Morgan, Shackell, Vergini, 2015 Richard Dunne.
@J_Wallace_84 Collectively and individually poor defensively, not helped by lack of midfield protection.
@Bateseyboy Yup - individually and collectively.
@George_S96 Yeah, that is quite odd.
@JonatanFilip Unless he's using the last few weeks as a learning exercise, it's more than a bit weird.
@Univarn Yeah, tired players who DGAF at this point. Needed to freshen up for the past few weeks. Shame.
@Ric_Aardo True.
@BardiTFC Just thinking the same myself. Lamela looking useful too. Just need Chadli to effing run about.
@SebSB Re: what we discussed the other day, the Mason hate's heating up again!
@James_R96 No way are they the worst in the league.
What I don't understand is why Pochettino hasn't even tried Stambouli as extra protection. We've been conceding too many goals all season.
Two horrendous goals to concede for two different reasons. Collectively poor at the back so far - goalkeeper, back four, midfield two.
@MC_of_A Also note Vertonghen's decision - a player that *should* have more natural defensive instincts. Collectively horrible defending.
@SeanTayTay Rose is injured mate. Official feed confirmed it.
...&amp; then Fazio giving Arnautović far too much space, allowing him to get a good shot away.
Defence was looking OK initially, then we've had Chiriches getting too tight on Walters &amp; having to foul on halfway &amp; take a yellow card...
@MatthewLesner My pleasure mate.
@MatthewLesner Suspect Archer might leave. Azzaoui is good but he needs a year of U21 football before we can judge really.
@MatthewLesner Obvious being Onomah/CCV? I think Grant Ward's got a really chance of getting some game-time! Also: Winks, Walker-Peters.
@dan_lille That was my exact thought.
@MattyYiddo13 @RossIngle Quite possibly. That was brutal.
@Nathan_a_clark I suspect you're right.
@IDontDoCreative Yeah, me too. But Walters is a fairly big guy.
@Yiddo282 I don't think it matters a great deal but probably Dier after his recent crossing exploits!
@senorvivo26 Yeah, I'd guess so. I always find it weird, though, that a player's not fit enough to start but *is* on the bench.
Is Rose deemed not quite fit enough to start, or are we taking the aerial threat of Walters seriously by playing Vertonghen left-back?
@BainsXIII Given that values will decline in the 6 months that we wait anyway, better just to take the hit now.
@BainsXIII I agree, we're going to have to take a hit on some players in order to get the squad the manager wants.
@CaveWebster @BainsXIII I'd like to think so. He seems pretty settled.
@sloader300 He seems to score every time he sets foot on a pitch!
@ParkLane_N17 I do! Yes. Be prepared to answer questions - i.e. they normally ask why you're there, if you're an agent, etc.
@HotspurFC82 I'd have him in the squad now, personally.
@Nickuae Isn't it ridiculous that a 16-year old who has only played U18 football has a sponsorship deal?!
@BainsXIII Interesting! Vertonghen, Davies, Lamela, Chadli &amp; Mason would all be green for me &amp; Holtby, Dembele, Paulinho &amp; Lennon all red.
Latest from the U18s... 
Expect involvement of U16 players once again - we do this at the end of the season to give them a taste before the next campaign begins.
Last league game of the season for our U18s today. We play Aston Villa at midday. Missing it to 'dog sit' for my parents. Kind son.
@Nickuae Interesting! Edwards has had a few attitude issues this year but hopefully back on course by now!
@Spurs_academy It's hard to tell with keepers as they tend to develop late but there's definitely something there. He's commanding/imposing.
@Spurs_academy I like both of them. Glover looks far better than most of that age. Maghoma can rely on his size too much but is talented.
@therealtommitch Something nice and uplifting to end the season with!
@Spurs_academy Well I did have one written out but I might wait a while now ;)
@therealtommitch Awesome, will listen. Can you do Can't Smile Without You please? Maybe we could put it on the end of last pod of season!
@therealtommitch Oh god, please don't do this. #PrayForHarry
@journeymanhisto My pleasure!
@journeymanhisto All noted! Will definitely answer at least some of these, possibly even this weekend if I get a chance.
@journeymanhisto Blog, definitely. Podcast, maybe. What did you have in mind? I'll see what I can do!
@Chopper_Tron Possibly. Hope he can make the step up!
@Boggo1 Yeah, absolutely. Was a masterclass today. Near enough 4-4-2, but they played it brilliantly.
Marcus Edwards' goal for England U17s at 28 seconds here: 
@benboorman21 ...will be an absolute hit in the PL, but he should give us some fun moments!
@benboorman21 It's the 'next season' that makes it hard - long-term I think Alli has a higher ceiling. Still not 100% convinced Pritchard...
@IainLiddle He'd be a great fit for them.
@Biggsy_89 Glad to hear, I am a fan of all those mentioned! Did Onomah play furthest forward of midfield three?
Cracking away performance from Boro. Kept Pritchard &amp; Jota quiet, played well on counter - especially in the 1st half. 2nd leg will be good!
@Gilzean498 Yeah, his work rate was great until he started to tire tonight.
@djrattigan @Billie_T He's really classy.
@Billie_T I know I need to let it go because: modern football, but I find his theatrics upsetting.
@Billie_T Had a quiet game tonight overall, made poor decisions. In fairness, Boro are excellent.
@EwanRoberts I will go Boro.
@IainLiddle I also really like Tarkowski.
@IainLiddle And Diagouraga won Supporter's Player of the Year - he's been surprisingly good this season.
@Biggsy_89 Thank you!
@EwanRoberts Just a shame this isn't the final. The other two are D-U-L-L in comparison.
Beautifully weighted cross from Jota. If I were a Premier League manager he's certainly one I'd be looking at.
@MC_of_A No, I imagine you probably feel pretty angry. They're - at best -irresponsible. Just hope it doesn't happen again.
@MC_of_A That's good news! When one of our family dogs got attacked (years ago) by three Staffordshire Bull Terriers, the owners ran off.
Boro fans have been brilliant so far, have helped create a really good atmosphere at Griffin Park.
@MC_of_A Poor little thing. Was sorry to read about the attack. Did the other dog have an owner?
Alex Pritchard starts for Brentford but, alas, Ryan Fredericks isn't involved for Middlesbrough. Not fit apparently.
@brettrainbow Perhaps I'll do the same, see how it compares.
@brettrainbow That'd work well.
@ScottGreen_GsY @Daily_Hotspur Recovering from injury :)
@mr5phere @brettrainbow Eriksen had about two good months IMO.
@brettrainbow Too many trolls to make this a real thing.
@brettrainbow Haha! I said he had a dip!
@brettrainbow He was our best in first few games too then had a slight dip. I tweeted this: 
Nailed it.
@BuffaloHoya @brettrainbow No! Not for our 3rd best player this season who also helps on the 'homegrown' front.
@11Goodie @JamesMawFFT He's been in our top 3 players this year, no point selling unless we get a *ludicrous* offer.
@brettrainbow He's been in our top 3 players this year, no point selling unless we get a *ludicrous* offer.
@JShaverin Even so, it sends the worst message.
@mcr_thfc SRSLY? I can't see it.
Musa Yahaya named in Nigeria's 35-man provisional squad for FIFA U20 World Cup in New Zealand: 
@HotPalle Ah, excellent! Nice work!
@NabilBentalad I'm an idiot, basically.
@pokeefe1 @lazythfc I've heard several things pertaining to a bad attitude.
@lazythfc Me either! I've heard bad things about his attitude before though.
@HotPalle It says he's ruled out :(
@TheTottenhamWay True. Out to get us.
Yeah, that'll be it. Let's hope it gets a better response next time. 
Why would we take £14m for Rose? We have no reason to sell. 
Aha! So maybe I wasbn't spouting rubbish after all! 
So, as usual, I was spouting rubbish. Dembele had a thigh injury. I made an 'ass' out of 'u' and 'me'.
Pretty strong squad. Expect: McGee; Walker-Peters, Maghoma, Veljkovic, Ogilvie; Winks, Ward; McEvoy, Miller/Onomah, Oduwa; Coulthirst.
McGee, Miles, Coulthirst, Harrison, Lesniak, Maghoma, McEneff, McEvoy, Miller, Oduwa, Ogilvie, Onomah, Veljkovic, Walker-Peters, Ward, Winks
U21s play Fulham at White Hart Lane this evening. Grant Ward &amp; Shaq Coulthirst are back after time out on loan. #THFC
@TobyFMinch Yeah, me too.
@mappsy91 Indeed! Presume he's back whilst recovering from injury.
Chadli attempting lots of shots with his weaker foot was my big 'take-away' message from this training video: 
@riki_rikidance @ebbp LOOK I DIDNT SLEEP WELL OK
@ebbp Might delete. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ebbp No. Really no.
@GaffneyVLC Thanks for a much-needed chuckle!
#FF I enjoyed @rtrssm again this week (@SebSB @BainsXIII) but it's never quite the same without @tehTrunk.
@journeymanhisto I'll try to listen today - thank you!
@bennosaurus Nor me. In an ideal world I'm a lot further left than Labour on the spectrum but don't tell anyone ;)
@clayski123 I shouldn't have really tweeted as I don't want to get into a full- on debate. Everyone has reasons.
@bennosaurus Yup. Although actually we had the more left wing brother so it could have been worse.
@tehTrunk At least it means we're now pretty much justified in our previously unjustified hatred of the general public.
@journeymanhisto ...connect more though. I need to become more politically active in terms of marches, campaigns. In meantime, goodbye NHS.
@journeymanhisto It's thoroughly demoralising and makes me realise what a selfish nation we are becoming. Actually makes me want to...
@tehTrunk Maybe you did: this is purgatory. 5 years of it at least.
I'm not angry; I'm disappointed.
@Matt_swan40 Anything to get rid of Vergini.
@king26ledley Would make sense as he's recovering from injury :)
@timabel6 @ebbp #Laboury
@JamesMawFFT Sure I've seen that hand somewhere...hmm...
@JackPittBrooke Haha! Triffic work.
@EwanRoberts Clinging to this. 
@JacobIsaih Going to Wolfsburg no?
@greg_jenner Quite. I had a blinkered view of how things would go based on the people I'm around at work, who are mostly Labour/left.
@NicholasMcKee He only played 11 matches that season I think?
@NicholasMcKee Which is one reason why I watched the Confed Cup Final where he supposedly played well. He was the same.
@Tomfoins87 Goodbye NHS as we know it.
@NicholasMcKee @BardiTFC @journeymanhisto Nope, quick feet and decent vision.
@davidcoates47 @BardiTFC @NicholasMcKee @journeymanhisto I was trying to wind Bardi up but he's not biting :)
@NicholasMcKee @BardiTFC @journeymanhisto I said Newc were awful &amp; I also said Paulinho should start every game now until end of season.
@BardiTFC @NicholasMcKee @journeymanhisto But he can be quite frustrating to watch. Paulinho's just not overly talented &amp; I feel pity.
@BardiTFC @NicholasMcKee @journeymanhisto I like Lamela's ability to do something a bit different from the norm. Also his work rate.
@NicholasMcKee Two things: Oscar keeps out Coutinho. And this Brazil side is not like previous Brazil sides.
@NicholasMcKee @BardiTFC @journeymanhisto Really not the case. I've been pretty critical of Lamela in the past, especially on the podcast.
@NicholasMcKee Both have more natural technical ability but lack in other areas.
@NicholasMcKee Such as?
@NicholasMcKee @BardiTFC @journeymanhisto I want to like him. He's a pretty honest player who usually tries to do the right things.
Jon Obika comes on for Swindon to make it four ex-Spurs players on the pitch (and one, Barthram, still on the bench).
Lovely, Nathan! Lovely!  
@BardiTFC @journeymanhisto I'm judging him on his Spurs career. I watched this game to try to see what we could have won.
@BardiTFC @journeymanhisto That was an aside. He played pretty badly on and off the ball - that's it, really.
@BardiTFC @journeymanhisto Re: 3-0, it could have been different: Spain missed two headers when attackers lost Paulinho from corners
@BardiTFC @journeymanhisto Not really tbh. I was expecting intense pressing &amp; it just...wasn't.
@spursfantommo84 I guess so.
@Gilzean498 Yeah, been well below par in the bits I've seen.
@timabel6 @tehTrunk I must admit, I've not watched any!
@tehTrunk Personally I think any attempt to try to make modern politics more accessible should be applauded.
@TheloniousFilth It's making me itch all over.
@timabel6 Feel like I deserve so much more than a Nathan Byrne assist.
@TheloniousFilth Annoying typo. Tempted to delete whole chain and start again.
Sam Ricketts just scored a *brilliant* header for Swindon from a Nathan Byrne (ex-Spurs!) corner. 1-1 in the Play-Off First Leg.
@SGEndersby @TheTottenhamWay There is indeed a buy-back option: 
@sloader300 It is true, we do have a buy-back clause.
@LouJayne1882 Hope so :)
@jair1970 In this game he had *such* an easy job. Luiz Gustavo holding, Oscar playing just ahead. All he had to do was screen &amp; 'shuttle'.
@dave_heron Agreed, partly because he might still carry value.
@CHLiquid Totally agree.
@tommymc93 But even with that, it looked slightly mishit on the replay! But yeah, that was the best thing he did.
I thought I'd convince myself that he can be a useful player for us, but I've never been more sure that he'll only ever be squad fodder.
On the ball he was pretty much exactly what we've come to know - fine when passing the ball a few yards, not so fine when attempting more.
...useful, but equally at times clumsy. He marshalled space relatively well, but had the excellent Luiz Gustavo doing the hard work.
He may have been really good across the rest of the tournament, but in the final he achieved next to nothing. His pressing was at times...
I even thought I'd record a little commentary as a segment for @LoveTheShirt. I approached it with genuine positivity, started of upbeat.
Sad git that I am, I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt to see how he did &amp; get a new outlook on what we can get out of him.
Over the past 2 days I've watched the 2013 Confederations Cup Final between Brazil &amp; Spain. Paulinho won the tournament's 'Bronze Ball'.
@NabilBentalad Oh, he's mega talented. But needs to knuckle down.
@TheJiggified I reckon an England U21 call will happen soon...
@Leon_Mann Did @NChadli explain the etymology of his nickname? 
@NabilBentalad At least two years mate, probably three or four.
@ODernie Late June or early July I expect, but I could probably tell you most... who were you wondering about?
@AlexG3789 Thanks for the heads up!
Cameron Carter-Vickers receives another call-up. 
@LukeBBurgess Swansea because it was a bit different...
Young Spurs midfielder Marcus Edwards scored the only goal of the game for the England U17s earlier. 
@LukeBBurgess Avoid the obvious. Swansea at home, WBA away.
"Burn out? In the 50s they played with a heavier ball on claggy pitches &amp; their boots were made of bricks". Etc etc. 
@ReesHitchcock We have!
@_Alex1993_ @WelhamOfficial Yeah, that was it. They were just generally very angry that day. I got hissed at walking in.
Harry Winks and Harry Voss both included in the training pictures today. @HarryWinks_ hiding behind Fazio. 
@WelhamOfficial It got really aggro there last year - he had to be taken off to avoid it!
@RobrafM Haha quick work! Shame he didn't do it the other way round - ie Del Boy's head into Boateng...
"Play it nice and cool, son, nice and cool, you know what I mean?" #Boateng #FCBayern #FCB 
@Flav_Bateman I had to switch off. Genuinely too cowardly to finish it.
@ndyGerlis @BillyMacfarlane Decent piece. The back injury was legit and caused by a thigh tear btw.
@prezbegone Nothing special, and blighted by injuries still.
@JacobIsaih I don't know, I've been trying to work it out. I don't think he's let us down when he's played. I like him.
@PaxtonRoadN17 I like Pritchard but Lamela is technically superior.
@BillyMacfarlane I think Townsend had a period where he looked fairly improved and consistent tbh.
@Nikhil_Saglani :) I got it from your replies!
@Nikhil_Saglani Definitely!
@timabel6 I should tweet a fishing emoji about now shouldn't I?
@MattyYiddo13 Well said :)
@JamesMawFFT Can only applaud your sacrifice.
@JacobIsaih In some matches. He needed resting/dropping a few weeks back but he's not trusted anyone to come in.
@lambrosia13 Got to the pace of the game.
@PaxtonRoadN17 I still think he can be a useful payer for us. I like his close control and vision.
@Nunssandwich We can but hope.
@gav2illiams :)
@BillyMacfarlane No. I was hoping that as Eriksen declined, Lamela would rise. But alas it's not happened.
@ohagan_paul First in - well done!
@journeymanhisto @tehTrunk If only :)
@lilywhitetactic Very thorough piece yet again, keep up the good work! You must spend *so much* time on these, and it shows.
@lilywhitetactic Interesting take on it mate, would ave been interesting to see interceptions/'defensive actions' too.
@kev_g1 GTFO!
@JamesMawFFT P.S. It was a delight to hear your dulcet tones this week. Sorry I missed you!
@JamesMawFFT Not just that, I've added him to my fantasy team for the run-in. If that's not the kiss of death, nothing is.
Call me optimistic, but I felt like something clicked on Sunday. Think we might see some productivity from Lamela in the last three matches.
All of Erik Lamela's touches vs Manchester City: 
My youth update went a bit meta this week, apologies. Realised after reading a sentence that it didn't even make sense.
@WastedP0tential I'm home in South Bucks and here tomorrow night too, about 10 mins from Brunel...
All of Nabil Bentaleb's touches vs Manchester City: 
Some brilliant saves from McGee and that pass from Veljkovic for Winks' goal was sublime. 
@RichArrowsmith Oh great. Here comes a 'funny' campaign...
@WastedP0tential Hello mate, I never heard back from you?
@RickyTFC @TheloniousFilth @BardiTFC If this happens (I pray it doesn't) I'm going to get bored of saying that he didn't play CM for Newc.
@adamdnathan He's good but very inconsistent (as expected from a young player). Think Chadli gets in ahead of him for Belgium still.
@adamdnathan Valdez hasn't played enough for us to take such a gamble. Never been a great Chicharito fan &amp; he'd want to be main man.
@adamdnathan I like Januzaj but we need someone who fits the system - plays on shoulder, works hard, scores regular goals.
@2ndHandTardis I'd assume he can play but I'm not actually sure.
@JohnoMuller Agree with your summary!
@unfitforpurpose @GaffneyVLC Yeah, I kind of agree with this.
@DavePointing Let's hope so!
@hengy Will do him good, I'm sure.
@LouJayne1882 Yeah, would have been nice.
@garam_chai82 @GaffneyVLC Corluka was underrated too. Great player!
@adamdnathan Replacing circa £70k in wages with the best part of £300k on three players we'd ordinarily not want doesn't sound great to me.
@GaffneyVLC Nope, same deal with Pritchard, who now has Play-Off involvement anyway.
Dele Alli is unable to play in Spurs' remaining games as his loan remains in place until after the conclusion of the Premier League season.
@GaffneyVLC Croatians, obvs.
@RickyTFC @Towno10 @MrCracknell I love him more than you! Me! Me! Me!
@Nikhil_Saglani &gt;s round the wrong way mate x
@LouJayne1882 Haha! @poppydolphin22 must be a very grown-up 12-year old :)
@LouJayne1882 @poppydolphin22 He is only just 18 so still just a youngster :)
@OneVertonghen Hello mate. Expecting him to be released. He's not awful but not quite at the required standard.
@LouJayne1882 Did you both have a nice day?
@LouJayne1882 @THFCacademy @poppydolphin22 Veljkovic is a class act, I have high hopes for him!
@paul_tomkins Oh me too - I like it! Had a lovely time in Florence this season and would like to do another European trip next.
And thanks to @unfitforpurpose for putting me onto it!
Recommended reading for fans of any club about the state of the PL (&amp; its fans). Great piece, @paul_tomkins! 
@THFCacademy It will have been down to other factors (fitness, who needs experience) - CCV is far higher n the pecking order.
Pritchard also 2nd in Supporters' Player of the Year: 'Diagouraga was named Supporters’ Player of the Year, ahead of Alex Pritchard &amp; Jota.'
17-year old goalkeeper Tom Glover made his Australia U20 debut in a 3-2 win over New Zealand. 
@tglover93 Congrats on making your debut! Another photo: 
@foxythfc I would suggest speaking to @LouJayne1882 who has already contacted City!
@paxtonlad @GaffneyVLC @BenPearceSpurs If anyone else can be bothered to watch it, the final's on youtube: 
@paxtonlad @GaffneyVLC He got 3rd best player of the tournament, right?
@GaffneyVLC @BenPearceSpurs I keep meaning to re-watch those matches to see if he's actually that good in them.
@NickOsbaldiston @BenPearceSpurs Well, myself and others wondered about this... 
@JME_Watts84 @pokeefe1 @charlieparrish @J_Wallace_84 That's really harsh given how little we've seen of him. Not had a bad game, has he?
@BenPearceSpurs Yeah, he did fine again. Not amazing, but fresh legs and a willingness to shoot.
@BenPearceSpurs Which is what leads me to assume (wrongly, perhaps) that something's happened off the pitch. Be that interviews or attitude.
@reverse_ball Yup! Shows how poorly thought out the majority of the signings were!
@BillyMacfarlane @andyperry79 It's very plausible.
Get well soon, Jimmy. 
@ThadCollins Really? I've always found it hard to warm to him as he so often has failed to deliver. Waste of talent.
@J_Wallace_84 @charlieparrish Townsend, Dembele and £10m for Schneiderlin sounds fair.
@DavidBullockEdu Of course!
@tomedwards @lev_simon @charlieparrish I thought his performance vs Arsenal was overstated but was very impressed vs Liverpool.
@ritchgrove Yup, and doesn't have the vision to compensate for that.
@DickieDes @LoveTheShirt Yeah, huge drop-off. A lot's been asked of him physically this year, most running he'll have ever done.
@COYS64 Interesting - what did he say?
@mikma306 @charlieparrish @J_Wallace_84 Fitness test?
@MJQX We're definitely going to have to accept less money than we otherwise might have done.
@charlieparrish And Holtby. Include Bongani Khumalo/Grant Hall too if you like!
@jilllewis33 Better to get rid of bad apples as early as possible.
@J_Wallace_84 @charlieparrish I'd be sorry if we sold Stambouli. I am one of few who sees potential in him.
@NickOsbaldiston Maybe. Remains to be seen!
@CallumHaymes Interesting - wonder if it was a fitness test?
@king26ledley @tomedwards @charlieparrish Whilst they might play same position (sometimes) they have entirely different functions.
@lev_simon @tomedwards @charlieparrish Nailed it re: on-pitch stuff. But also he's clearly done something else. Attitude? Interviews?.
@BettsJulian @charlieparrish I think the opposite - selling will be hard, buying comparatively easy.
@andyperry79 @charlieparrish But there have been times where he's clearly annoyed coaching staff and they've withdrawn him early.
@andyperry79 @charlieparrish I'd say he's made fairly substantial leaps in that regard this season (he's shooting a *lot* less for eg).
@bernardthfc And rightly so.
@charlieparrish I'm not so convinced Fazio/Paulinho are in the list after the last few weeks. But I'd be happy with both going.
@PeteDomican I am no great fan either but he should have played more this season.
@DavidBullockEdu Too long... but that's what years of no joined-up thinking does.
@J_Wallace_84 @charlieparrish Yeah, they've been linked with him for a long time now and that story refuses to go away.
@BillyMacfarlane Haha, you drew the same conclusion as me... yes, it wouldn't surprise me at all!
@samgoldman91 I agree. He *could* have played a part this season and done fine but I don't think he's essential in any way.
@JackIngleton I'm convinced he will be.
@lilywhitetactic By that I mean any midfielder who would cycle back (Paulinho had similar impact) helped, rather than Dembele in particular.
@lilywhitetactic Personally I think it was just having a more natural third midfielder rather than Dembele specifically, but totally agree.
@charlieparrish Yeah, Townsend had another little run and then jettisoned too. Suspect he's another that'll leave, sadly.
@JackIngleton Paulinho/Stambouli both on the bench ahead of him is pretty telling, no?
@biboelm I don't think he's all that good personally.
@davidcoates47 I think it's likely that he is seen as not pulling in the same direction as others. Paulinho/Stambouli both ahead of him!
After yesterday I think we have to assume that Dembele, for whatever reason, is on the naughty step with Capoue/Kaboul. He'll surely leave.
@king26ledley Do you know why? Has the role required more running, and less dominating of the ball?
@PhilipCaren A lot will depend on how he gets on in pre-season. But I have my doubts.
@Melric24 Yeah, I was surprised that he was viewed as not naturally talented, because he clearly is!
Swansea's signings rated here: 
Well done, Alex Pritchard! 
@Billie_T @KennyPalmer @WelshSpur07 I didn't think Soldado was all that mate.
@Billie_T @KennyPalmer @WelshSpur07 Today was fun and some players turned up for the first time in weeks.
@PeejTHFC Lamela made some fantastic tackles today.
@_icwhite @kev_g1 @JamesMawFFT @SebSB No but it makes so much sense with the ground covered by each.
@pokeefe1 @InsideN17 I really like him, but worth noting that he generally plays alongside a destroyer. So do we need a Wanyama too?
@_icwhite @kev_g1 @JamesMawFFT @SebSB There's a lot of burn-out going on, Eriksen, Mason, Kane, Chadli have all noticeably dropped off.
@andyplas Dembele's defensive qualities aren't great IMO but I do find it odd that he's been jettisoned!
@robmather @kev_g1 Given that this is his first PL season it's almost certainly too early to say. But we're likely to finish 6th with him.
@kev_g1 @JamesMawFFT @SebSB He did track him. From box to box. He even tried to organise his teammates. Then inexplicably stepped up!
@andyplas But we need a player who is a lot more defensive, right? So it's not Mason's fault.
@JamesMawFFT @SebSB Me too, so I'll look forward to that! I think Eriksen needs a kick up the bum so it'd be worth experimenting.
@SebSB Were you thinking of getting rid? Please don't!
@JamesMawFFT @SebSB Are you going to slate Ryan this week, James? He got enough last week!
@Nikhil_Saglani @SebSB Yeah. I see it frequently. That, and people saying he's the problem with our midfield.
@SebSB We must immerse ourselves in slightly different podcasts and Twitter follows!
@SebSB Nice piece, Seb. Interested that you feel Mason doesn't get much criticism. I see &amp; hear nothing *but* criticism for him.
@Grimmers8 He was a shedload better. Actually tracked back too.
@EwanRoberts Yeah, Dier was often looking up and seeing Lamela running towards him from the centre, tracked. Stop, turn, pass back.
And it wasn't just his creativity that was good today... 
@EwanRoberts His best showing for us! Really liked his performance. Just wish that shot had gone in at the end.
Lamela: 6 key passes today, 2 more than the next highest number. He was much more creative! 
@MattMellow ?
@benfranksthfc ALL OF THE STRIKERS
@benfranksthfc With who up top? Soldado and Adebayor? Are you insane, Ben?
@Mark_Lynch1 Yeah, there were occasions where I was screaming for him to shoot!
@Mr__Beaker Erm... ok.
@ABPSpurs @unfitforpurpose Yeah, Mason's pooped. Needs taking out the team. Has done for a while.
@Mr__Beaker For emphasis, you charmer.
@Tomas_Cresswell Should he have gone with his head maybe?
We were worth at least a point today; let down by some slack finishing. But played well &amp; Lamela/Chadli had their best matches in *ages*.
In all seriousness, it was brilliant to see Pochettino 'try something'. And he nearly got us back into it.
We finished the match in a 4-1-2-1-2 with Soldado and Adebayor up front, and Paulinho in midfield. Let's all just take a moment. #THFC
@unfitforpurpose @ABPSpurs One day he'll do something worthy!
@chris_coys So weak too, twice he's done that.
@InsideN17 "Harry" - nailed it.
@chris_coys Should have buried it.
"...and Paulinho got both assists."
@ABPSpurs Added a bit of energy but that was a great chance he just had.
Me, teary eyed, 50 years from now: "I remember a time when we brought on Soldado &amp; Adebayor &amp; both scored in a 2-1 win against City".
OMG I WAS JOKING POCHETTINO YOU NUTCASE
@AlanWindham Nah, excellent is pushing it. He's been 7/10 today. Which is progress.
@Tomas_Cresswell I kind of agree. He's so weak-willed.
@Studub Hope he becomes more, naturally.
@AlanWindham Marginally perhaps.
@Josh_Smitho I like him.
@thejondaniels He deserves it!
@BigManDom_ Yeah, has done well today.
@therealshuban Why? I want him to come good.
Lamela is such a battler. If there's any justice in the world he will become, at least, an above average player for us. #THFC
Much better 2nd half from Mason. Paulinho on is probably the right move, but I'd have loved to see Stambouli on &amp; Bentaleb pushed up a bit.
@One_Club_THFC @Nikhil_Saglani Seen it again, plenty of bodies that way, he did the right thing.
@Studub @Nikhil_Saglani Lamela was an option but not immediately.
@Studub @Nikhil_Saglani But only when the ball was caught under Kane's feet. Once he got settled Chadli wasn't an easy pass.
@Nikhil_Saglani To who?
@SebSB @tehTrunk He has, I've been pleasantly surprised. Been told, perhaps?
@tehTrunk He's been good (as has Chadli actually).
@BenPearceSpurs That one wasn't his fault (for once)... eeeeeveryone offside and not moving back onside!
@chris_coys At least he took responsibility, mind.
Chadli did all the hard work, should have had a blast! Then when it came out to Eriksen he was waiting for three men to get back onside.
That touch from Rose!
@journeymanhisto @greg_jenner I've wanted to see Stambouli holding with Bentaleb and Mason freed up for a while.
@DavidBullockEdu Indeed: 
@moneymike008 Actually I thought Chadli had his best half in a while.
@greg_jenner Eriksen needed dropping weeks ago, but there's just no alternative unless you push Mason forward.
Just can't wait for Soldado and Adebayor to come on and kill the buzz.
Today's performance has been loads better (so far) than most in recent weeks. Much more entertaining match in general too.
@Univarn Me too, red card waiting to happen.
@Phon1k I'd have started Stambouli instead of Eriksen. But now I'd probably bring on Stambouli for Mason.
@adamdnathan Lamela's been really quite creative today, has played some nice passes and created two chances from corners too.
@Mark_Lynch1 Agree on all points!
To clarify, in the second part of that I meant that there's plenty to be pleased with in the team's performance, not Mason's.
@Ddonlon17 Yeah, definitely
@gardarStNikulas Which bit do you disagree with? That Mason's done poorly or that overall we've done well?
@sebastiansings I *wish* we had played Stambouli instead of Chadli or Eriksen today.
@SeanTayTay Agreed.
@adamdnathan Actually I think both have had pretty decent halves, their best in weeks.
Those early missed chances were key. Chadli just had to lift his pass to Lamela &amp; he had a great chance! 
Mason's had a rough half (on and off the ball), but overall there's plenty to be pleased with against high quality opposition.
Some really decent spells but lacking finesse &amp; incisiveness in final third &amp; loose (again) at the back. Typical of a young side, I guess.
@GazFitzy Near post.
@Nikhil_Saglani @LiamJM10 He nearly always goes near.
@SebSB It was *very* foolish.
@SebSB NB: that 'offside trap' wasn't something he learnt in the academy. :D
I love Hugo. Love him. But he really shouldn't be beaten *that* easily at his near post. It was so typically Aguero. Knew what was coming.
Aguero when he wakes up on the morning of a match against Spurs. 
Mason trying to play offside at the last second against one of the most intelligent forwards in the world? Not your brightest idea, Ryan.
@chris_coys @Nikhil_Saglani Aguero probably had an open goal without it...
@Nikhil_Saglani Definitely not intentional, but a foul nonetheless.
@Nikhil_Saglani Definite contact there, mate. Would have felt harsh as it wasn't deliberate, but a legitimate penalty.
We're quick to tuck into of a 4-4-1-1 when not in possession, something we've seen a fair bit of lately. Lamela/Chadli slightly more narrow.
"Chadli coming in-field onto his favoured left foot". Yeah, ok.
And now Kane. City look horrific defensively, we're playing right through them!
Two great chances already &amp; we've taken neither. You HAVE to take these chances vs the best teams. Chadli with tame pass, Dier free header.
Gap between midfield and defence is already a lot smaller than vs Southampton, that was something that caused us a big issue.
@journeymanhisto @MC_of_A Yeah totally. But, ironically, Poch might argue that Mason's actually the *only one* fulfilling instructions.
@MC_of_A I think the whole team needs better drilling on the press. Defence has to push, wingers squeeze, etc. So many roles not fulfilled.
@MC_of_A You and I *know* that's an issue, but it's definitely not a stick to beat him with.
@MC_of_A He did what he's been asked to do - make tackles, get close to playmakers. He doesn't hold. He's clearly not instructed to.
@CoysNews Interesting, wonder if that's Carter-Vickers?
@MC_of_A Whilst I agree that we needed change today Paulinho was passable against New &amp; Mason was passable against Soton. 6/10 performances.
@gbewing Well, he was first choice right-back at the start of the year.
@JamScones95 That's been the story since he joined according to their fans.
@will_irwin4 Definitely a brainer. Dier is most suited to playing up against Aguero IMO. Aguero vs Fazio scares me...
Just revisited article I wrote in May 2014 about who might &amp; might not do well under Pochettino. I'd say I got 4/6: 
@Coytey What a fantastic run!
Coventry City proved a great loan move for Grant Ward. Championship next year?  
@Billie_T Haha you're a terrible man!
@JRoles8 Proper utility man aren't you? On Football Manager you'll be D/M/S (R, C, L).
@THFCSPURS19 @Billie_T That's how we used Pritchard last year.
@lilywhite_rose @Billie_T Alli and Pritchard will hopefully be with us for pre-season and judgements will be made from there.
@15mmw Don't think there was mate.
@SpencuhIsABeast Made right back his own then got injured.
@Billie_T Depends on the terms of his loan I think. I've emailed PL to ask them.
@WelshSpur07 Possibly! On a free as his contract is up.
Dele Alli &amp; Grant Ward also in action today. Alli's MK Dons are already ahead. Ward has impressed in central midfield for Coventry on loan.
@SimonPeach @charlieparrish The Belgian link at Spurs might work against us if he's friendly with Dembele...!
Spurs loanee Khumalo in action for Colchester on Sky Sports 2 (or a stream if you refuse to give Sky £). Wonder where he'll be next year...
@Nikhil_Saglani @charlieparrish Salah has some baggage. He's behaved strangely towards Jewish players in the past (for whatever reason).
@charlieparrish Would you play Alderweireld at CB, Charlie?
@TimHenschke @Razorrico86 I know, he loves him! I have a slight soft spot too because he is talented...
@kev_g1 I think he is, yeah. Chiriches is a passable PL right-back. Yedlin looked like a naive kid on debut, needs time to adjust.
@robertlawson258 @jayjaffa Possibly. I hope so!
@kev_g1 I think it'd be pretty unfair on Yedlin...
@GUYSHELTON Vertonghen's our most overrated player. But he has the tools to deal with Aguero better than Fazio.
@Big_D_Yid81 Yup, time for 4-3-3.
@pete_turner23 No, Sterling was left out (injured?).
@SeanTayTay @steve_bracey Chiriches is a passable PL right back. Yedlin looked... 'not ready' on debut.
@Mike_Andrews24 Yeah agreed.
@samdom That'd be pretty unfair on Yedlin I think.
@SeanTayTay @steve_bracey I think that'd be pretty unfair on the player tbh.
@TheloniousFilth @BCTHEGRANDSLAM Need to unfollow someone else. This is where my ruthlessness comes into its own.
@BCTHEGRANDSLAM @TheloniousFilth Haha! Textbook.
@CallumHaymes I don't think Naughton's significantly better than Chiriches or Dier at right back tbh, guess that was the thinking.
@BCTHEGRANDSLAM I'm a ruthless mofo so don't cry when I inevitably unfollow you for too much boxing chat! ;-) Are you well mate?
@AphexTriplets Haha!
@LouJayne1882 I think that's my preference too.
@cdmarks90 Walker-Peters is really small still, not ready just yet.
@steve_bracey Yedlin? Really? That'd be the cliched 'baptism of fire'.
@jayjaffa Yeah, think I feel the same. Chiriches, Dier, Vertonghen, Rose.
@cdmarks90 Likewise. So Chiriches to get the nod?
Play Chiriches at RB to allow Dier to play CB (pace vs Aguero) or stick with Dier RB/Fazio CB? Tough call. Got to defend deeper either way.
@robertlawson258 @jayjaffa A few reasons: he's pretty selfish, he doesn't always work back &amp; he flits in &amp; out quite a bit.
@onlyonepk That's glorious. Enjoy! And safe journey.
@Zonal_Marking It was refreshing compared to a lot of the sport I watch where the opposition treat each other like actual enemies.
@Zonal_Marking Haha! They were both very respectful, hand shake before final frame, etc. Pleasant watching experience.
@Zonal_Marking Brilliantly tense but played in a good spirit.
@TheReal_Milo @onlyonepk Think staying awake or setting an alarm is the only way!
@TheReal_Milo @onlyonepk @thebillynicn17 I'm in Somerset for my dad's birthday, mate. I reckon maybe First Row links will appear tomorrow.
@onlyonepk Are you going to, PK? I can't decide. Would quite like to watch a re-run without knowing result but not sure how?!
@journeymanhisto @REL_10 Exactly that. Pre-season at least.
@sm_ld @Nikhil_Saglani If you truly believe that, you've not watched enough of him. Or you're an idiot.
@sm_ld @Nikhil_Saglani Can we not just agree that they're both great, and very different? But Kane's *clearly* had a better season.
@ebbp @therealflannerz I just wonder how the little one will be able to compete with your Beatrices, your Eugenies.
@therealflannerz @ebbp It's one of them, Clive, where the head's almost *too* big.
@ebbp @therealflannerz That's what you want from your wife - babies.
@ebbp Better.
@Ollie_Davis @Football__Tweet @BBCSporf Such a scummy thing to do.
Christ there are some cynical accounts out there. @Football__Tweet using a tragedy to get RTs. Brazenly used the official QPR Fer image.
@davidcoates47 Oh it won't happen. But whilst it's still possible, I want all the results to go Spurs' way.
@SingleMaltSuds Yeah - can't really understand that as he was playing fairly well.
@davidcoates47 Whilst it's still mathematically possible for us to finish 4th, we need United to lose. That's why I want them to win.
West Brom are playing four centre-backs and four central midfielders today. Pulis is really Pulis-ing it today. Hope he gets a result!
@jayjaffa And also one that - like Mason/Townsend/Kane - has quite a lot of league experience already under his belt.
@jayjaffa I'm thrilled to have another academy prospect in the squad! I'd say excitement levels are about 7. Still *slightly* skeptical.
@trogers68 I think they will make play-offs, but I'm not 100% sure - I emailed Premier League to ask, awaiting response.
@MC_of_A Only three now, right?
Would have been interesting to see what might have happened had Hector not scored for Reading then, as it was a clear foul in box by Martin.
Pritchard has done his bit today!  
@MC_of_A His close control is really excellent. Downside is he can be quite greedy so wastes good opportunities to play a killer pass.
U18s losing 3-0 at WBA. We're without a whole host of players inc Walker-Peters, Carter-Vickers, Maghoma, Amos. 
@Gilzean498 @TomMooreJourno In the blink on an eye it probably wasn't entirely clear. I liked Tom's excitement :)
@onlyonepk @TheLadBible FML
@pete_turner23 Haha!
Unless they name her Arya I DGAF. #RoyalBaby
U16 LB Nick Tsaroulla making his first start for the U18s today. CB Joy Mukena on bench for first time too. #THFC 
@spurs_fanatical @therealshuban @HotspurAmerica @rtrssm @SebSB I'd go along with that too. Stambouli surely a better CM option?
@SebSB I don't have a particular preference of either style as it happens. But I can see why Palace fans would read this and smile.
@SebSB Really interesting! Makes for a stark comparison with Levy, who rarely talks to anyone, let alone the press &amp; gives little away.
@Tomfoins87 Like... Bentaleb could feasibly be elite level in a few years. I love Hudd but he's barely been even an *England* player.
@Tomfoins87 Possibly the same person who wrote this on mine yesterday?! 
@TheFBAs Thanks for tweeting!
@Gilzean498 I'm a bronze member in South Bucks and also wouldn't go to MK.
@ADZMB15 @LoveTheShirt It was @CaseTFC (with a little help I gather) who made it happen. Great idea!
Issue 2 of the @LoveTheShirt fanzine sold out, so we (royal we) have made a digital version available for £1: 
@tehTrunk I'll be ranting in caps lock about shoe-wavers.
@tehTrunk No, I'll be sat at home watching the game on a stats website.
@andyperry79 Haha! That really tickled me! Thanks Andy, appreciate it mate. Have a good weekend.
@tehTrunk You deserve MK you mug.
Make sure you have your say in this survey by @THSTOfficial. 
@djrattigan Exactly. Because... why not? We appointed him for a reason, let's see it through.
@HMills_6 I know right?! Cheers by the way x
@onlyonepk I had a pretty horrific match, mind.
@waiting4the7_18 It was fun :D
@RichArrowsmith Liar.
@RegWhelk I've never understood that!
@MrDarrenFox I've never understood that!
@brennt :D
@ShanePatton88 I've never understood that!
@KneesTrembly ;-)
@EWPElectrical1 I'm really not. I do not want success at all costs.
@nybackf Yeah, I like it when a post goes round in such circles that it ends up disagreeing with itself.
@gibgibgib1 Maybe! I found it genuinely quite endearing!
@KidiabaPonyTail Endearing :D
@dazradley @Ric_Aardo There'll be loads of outgoings so there *must* be incomings.
@Matt_swan40 Haha! I was shocked!
@Ric_Aardo And one of the worst in the first half vs West Ham. But I agree he should have been involved more.
@Nikhil_Saglani Oh the comments are definitely better! Cheers Nikhil x
To be fair, Stokesie has nailed his description of me. 
@EWPElectrical1 Are you kidding? I would be so, so gutted if that happened. Urge you to watch this: 
@EWPElectrical1 What's the alternative to Levy though?
@Ric_Aardo I guess my question is... who should he have been playing instead?
@RenoWallabout @AlienatorDr Yeah, that was kinda baffling.
@Nathan_a_clark Cheers Nathan!
@gibgibgib1 Well said. He's had a tough job so far. Next year hopefully easier.
@sayers_14 Thanks Joe. Haha I know, some odd comments!
@gothicgnome Isn't she cute? Wild though. Zero training!
@kev_g1 Yeah, me too. He seems like a genuinely decent chap and he's a good guy to have as a figurehead.
@AlienatorDr Thanks Josh!
@Chrisclark1975 Just caught up - some views that are *quite* different to my own, let's put it that way!
@brettrainbow Thanks mate!
@srplester @GlenOcsko Hahahahaha!
@GlenOcsko Haha! Which players mate?!
@Gilzean498 Yeah, this is it... but he has as much chance as anyone of making us punch above our weight.
@EWPElectrical1 No? Then what?
@LouJayne1882 Thank you. Me too.
@lilywhitetactic Cheers Joshua!
@djrattigan Cheers Dan. Totally agree. I am guilty myself.
@chrisb1969 Cheers mate!
@Roddy_Campbell Apparently he's on gardening leave...
@ebbp Haha I've not had a proper look yet but I've heard they're bad...
@MicahKellner Massive Spurs fan. She's my parents'.
ICYMI, I wrote about patience being required... And not just until the end of the season. 
This little bitch keeps eating sheep excrement. 
Wrote a quick piece on demands of instant success. 'Pochettino’s five-year project': 
@bankruptspurs Definitely time to come back now.
Really interesting piece from @jonawils about how defensive football is absolutely *not* 'anti-futbol'. 
@LouJayne1882 Yeah at 2pm. You'd need to check with City I think!
@lilywhitetactic Perhaps but we are much more well known, pay better, and are based in the capital.
@JamesMawFFT Just listened. Got the impression Murphy's irritation had been building over season. Pearson as passive-aggressive as ever.
@JamesMawFFT Can't wait to hear this interview as I generally think Pearson carries himself *terribly*.
@BuffaloHoya WHY I OUGHTTA
@Nikhil_Saglani @TheGrandPappi Depends on terms of loans. Alli should be fine as he'll be on a 'youth loan'. Pritchard was last year.
@lilywhitetactic No doubt. What's interesting is that he's at a club with more pulling power now so his net will be wider.
If I get a chance over the next few days I've got an article brewing about ongoing fixation with getting answers &amp;/or results immediately.
@lilywhitetactic Hi! Some good ideas. Not sure the MV thing quite works for the reasons you mentioned in the article but good for thought!
@domsib Ogilvie is closest to the first team mate and I get the impression he's not really kicked on this year.
@xXRaferAlstonXx That is *awful*
@moneymike008 @HarryBrooks11 I don't think it's impossible that he'd solve problems but we shouldn't rely on him being a silver bullet.
@xXRaferAlstonXx Well KWP plays right-back, so I don't think that'd make that much difference. Ogilvie perhaps?
@TheGrandPappi I'm really not sure mate! Would need to check PL regulations. Same for Pritchard.
@HarryBrooks11 Well Schneiderlin normally plays alongside a destroyer, so it does worry me that it wouldn't...
@BigLeBowenski @LoveTheShirt Someone else said that a year or so ago - I can't hear the similarity myself, but I was a big Mabbsy fan.
@MC_of_A Also: you think you're good at cheating in exams. You are not. You are incredibly bad at it.
@brettrainbow I think Mason could be so useful as a front-foot presser who can link play a bit like Davis does for Southampton.
I disagree with elements of the analysis here but it's another cracking piece of work from @brettrainbow. 
@brettrainbow But yeah, dropping Chadli/Eriksen, switching to a 3 &amp; putting Stambouli in there would have solved many defensive issues.
@brettrainbow Also think there's a problem with Poch being caught between CBs dropping deep to cope with pace &amp; playing high line to press.
@brettrainbow Our midfield is a problem, definitely, but it needn't be with a coherent, vocal, commanding pair of CBs behind.
@brettrainbow GIF 3: Fazio misjudges flight/is wrong side/is weak. GIF 5: Vertonghen giving Pelle an unbelievable amount of freedom.
@brettrainbow ...least because of our defence. GIF 1: defence 10 yards too deep. GIF 2: CBs don't communicate &amp; go with same man.
@brettrainbow Just caught up on this, it's great! There's so much wrong it's unreal. Mason/Bentaleb were a problem (again) but not...
@OneVertonghen @CharmanDier None of the strikers are anything like ready, sorry to disappoint.
@CallumHaymes @Nikhil_Saglani Without EL there would be no 2014/15 Harry Kane. And I wouldn't have had a delicious pizza in Florence.
@ztranche No, afraid that data is not available.
@adamkinsley Indeed.
@tomdavey88 Yeah. We took the money we could I guess.
@SeanTayTay Totally agree. On balance I'd rather have Dawson in the squad than Fazio.
DAWSON! Cracking header too, but the marking was non-existent as Liverpool rushed out trying to play offside.
@bennosaurus Ooh - I am indeed. How did he make his money?!
@danielwynnethfc Crafted by Spurs fan @IainLiddle who is a lovely man!
@SGEndersby Just! Maximum loss permitted.
@IainLiddle Love this: 
@IainLiddle Hahaha! Terrific work, sir!
@Benandthebuses Agree on Howe. But they did max out their losses (FFP wise).
@unfitforpurpose Yeah, that's fair.
Was this your doing @IainLiddle?! If so, what a way to bow out! 
@EdwardPrz @SebSB Takes little away from Howe &amp; their brand of football but makes mockery of some of the comment on quaint little Cherries.
@EdwardPrz @SebSB Personally think a mysterious Russian owner &amp; fact they maxed out losses &amp; pushed FFP to limit  makes it intriguing.
@EdwardPrz @SebSB I doubt the majority of their fans are at all bothered about the ownership and are just enjoying the moment.
@EdwardPrz @SebSB I think there are two separate issues which are both as interesting as one another (to outsiders).
@Walts_88 They made the maximum permitted loss.
@SebSB What's good is that Howe has mostly done things 'his way' &amp; has been given the players he wanted. They've played attractive football.
@alexpike83 @robgawthorp They could well be one of the richest. Their owners' wealth isn't known but he made his money post-communism.
@SebSB Howe's done a TERRIFIC job but the ownership raises eyebrows. This is worth a read (from last year): 
@unfitforpurpose No, but that is more likely down to Howe &amp; the fact that he wasn't able to. Little doubt they're essentially a plaything.
@unfitforpurpose I just find it a bit concerning that they made the £8m loss (max permitted) &amp; that he's rumoured to have put a lot in.
@unfitforpurpose They've been great and I really like Howe. And Adam Smith, obvs.
@unfitforpurpose You could go glass half full and say that he has 'moneyballed' them to glory with some calculated gambles.
@unfitforpurpose Depends if 1. He is *that* rich and 2. He sticks around. Could sell up and leave them with big wage bill, etcetera.
@alexpike83 @robgawthorp Yeah... Essentially they've taken a calculated risk and it's paid off. But it's just as well it has!
@EdwardPrz It'll come full circle at some point.
@unfitforpurpose In fairness that was exactly what FFP was designed for - to stop clubs bankrupting themselves.
@arunspurs @unfitforpurpose I'd forgotten about the Grabban sale, that'll see them right.
@hellothere_64 @slate_dawg The Grabban sale is probably the only thing saving them from a transfer embargo!
@InsideN17 You could say that he has 'moneyballed' them to glory with some calculated gambles... Or you could say bankrolled.
@EdwardPrz Course they don't, like plenty of ours would love to be taken over by an oil tycoon.
@RossFerguson19 Probably more sustainably, mind. They took a calculated gamble and it paid off.
@njs10 Yeah that might save them from a transfer embargo!
@hellothere_64 @slate_dawg Pushing FFP to its limits.
@njs10 It's not beyond the realms of possibility that they get a transfer embargo.
@robgawthorp Not vast amounts but pushing FFP to its limits.
@unfitforpurpose No, but it's not beyond the realms of possibility that they get a transfer embargo.
@JeffG15563 Tooled up too!
@JMS78 That's a bit extreme but can see why he'd make the comparison!
@paulsandey78 I wonder who he'll support?!
@carbon_robert It's not beyond the realms of possibility that they get a transfer embargo.
I assume there's nothing untoward about Maxim Demin. But the money spent is significant &amp; worth remembering: 
Cheery little seaside club with a young, English manager... sounds so idyllic until you read about a Russian benefactor bank-rolling them.
@tobydavis10 I had such high hopes for him so I'm really pleased to see him doing well.
@Mark_Lynch1 Ogilvie got on the bench once last March... he's not really kicked on since. I like him, though.
@collo1989 Hahaha!
@grayhamp @jilllewis33 Use blend of Development Squad and squad players to get through first stage, then try to win it.
@Mark_Lynch1 Proudest moment.
@David7335 I really like Oduwa. I was hoping he'd be on the bench at some point this season as he's a tricky customer. Maybe pre-season?
@collo1989 OK FINE YOU GOT THERE FIRST
@OWhitefoot Yeah, I was kinda hoping he'd have played more at this point. I'm a big fan!
@JCarnon I tweeted this the other day - it's great!
@SingleMaltSuds Just seen your @LoveTheShirt review on iTunes - thanks for the kind words, really nice of you!
@GavinC137 Couldn't make it tonight - had planned to go but meetings overran. 50 miles from me so couldn't get there in time.
@GavinC137 Alas, not tonight.
@shayanadamjee I think he should be competing for DM now tbh, but yeah, a good pre-season might give him a chance.
@shawry_ozspurs It is, yes. Would you mean sending his players along or travelling himself?
@kev_g1 I think he's cracking - when in the U21s with Bentaleb I had them down as playing at a similar level. Hope he can have same impact!
@CPeters1882 Oof. How long are you in the USA for?
@Adebayored I really hope so. I'm a big fan.
Also worth noting that Oduwa is able to play as he's on a 'youth loan' with Luton. He needs a game! 
Really chuffed to see Veljkovic return from injury tonight - he's been out for 11 weeks with a dislocated shoulder. 
@CPeters1882 ...or sent on loan to a PL team if he's not quite on a level with the rest.
@CPeters1882 I'm all good mate - you? I'd like Pritchard to be assessed in pre-season and then either used in cups initially like Kane...
@lev_simon I would think he'll be out on loan mate.
@gizzers23 They're really quite unpredictable at the moment - I'd not risk it!
@BarberRb You weren't alone mate!
@Danno_may I truly hope so, but I have a few reservations. Hopefully this time next year he'll be in the running for YPOTY too!
@M_C_Cassidy Truly is.
@ExpediaUK Thank you.
@realdealdanny Two of them have already left (although one has a sell-on clause). Academy is already self-sustaining which is great.
@timgrigg76 There were others but it was a lonely viewpoint, Tim!
@TheloniousFilth @LoveTheShirt I was implying that I wouldn't have predicted that, despite being a big fan.
@adampowley @MartinCloake @LoveTheShirt Spitting on himself IMO.
@CoysNews I've tried to remain calm amidst temptation!
@grayhamp It depends on the group, but we could put out a decent side!
@Nikhil_Saglani @LoveTheShirt And it would have been. Imagine where we'd be without his goals...
@TroMaxwel I think most Spurs fans feel genuinely proud of him.
@LouJayne1882 She knows her onions!
@merlaaad You throw enough shit...
@mcr_thfc That he'd win YPOTY? Nicely done ;-)
@MartinCloake @LoveTheShirt I think most people would have been happy - he was widely seen as an old-fashioned lump of a forward.
Al made a flashback at the start of this episode, which'll do nicely! 
That I was laughed at for making that prediction shows how far he's come; he was a long way from regular 1st team football just months ago.
At start of season I said on @LoveTheShirt that I wouldn't be surprised if Kane ended up as our first choice striker. 30 goals? YPOTY? Wow.
Dele Alli - who we signed in January - also included in the League One team having won Football League Young Player of the Year last week.
Impressive that we have Kane, Pritchard &amp; Byrne in the PFA teams of the year, all from our Academy, as well as Luongo, who we signed at 18.
@PFA Did you realise Luongo is spelt wrong?
@hkane28 Looking sharp! And your young lady looks lovely too. Have a great evening and GOOD LUCK!
@CarlItAsISeeIt @petespur Ah ok - I presumed his loan contract would end final day of their season but I could be totally wrong.
@spurs_fanatical @therealshuban Goal's not what it once was &amp; Greg supposedly has some good sources. Don't think too much is beyond belief.
@NabilBentalad I've no doubt he could play Premier League football.
@alex_barnham What would you like to know mate. He's a mega talent.
@petespur He can play as he was born after Jan 1993. From next season he'd need to be named in our squad list.
@NabilBentalad No, think it's unlikely now mate.
@tomdavey88 Alli is a CM and Pritchard either plays wide left or number 10.
No idea how the goalkeeper has got away with that. Such a clear foul; beaten to the ball and takes the player out.
@Shpates Yeah I've been very surprised.
@thfc_tommy 4-3-3 with Stambouli deepest. Any two of the three supporting Kane. Eriksen might well need dropping.
@thfc_tommy Alongside them!
The second chance was what led to the Bentaleb/Fazio altercation which Pochettino discusses here: 
@EvanStranger Can't tackle? I've seen him tackle well. Also I gather his positional play was seen as his greatest strength in France.
@tomedwards Hmm I considered that but it really wasn't an option when looking back. He should have told Davies to get rid though!
@RichArrowsmith And it's kinda ironic that you said "whisper it quietly" - something Dawson rarely did.
@thfc_tommy I quite like him, have been wanting him in since Cup Final.
@RichArrowsmith There's just no way he's significantly worse than Fazio to have warranted *that* change.
@DanielJosephLee Yeah, I want to see Dier get a full season at centre-back next year.
@EvanStranger I think he's easily a top-10 PL player but, aside from that, a DM is better than no DM. Would free RM/NB up to play.
I think a natural defensive midfielder coming in this summer will really help, but - as I've said for weeks - I'd play Stambouli until then.
They're not helped at all by a lack of vocal leadership from centre-back. They'd benefit from someone who will talk/instruct behind them.
Davis' two big chances yday showed issues with our DM: 1. Davis runs off Mason &amp; gets shot away, 2. Bentaleb ball-watching &amp; allows space.
@chris_coys Lay off to where? 
@ExpediaUK Hello - do you have an email address for complaints? Thanks!
@Svucka How'd he do?
@spursycob @adamdnathan @adammanson I also think Jan's overrated &amp; we could improve on him, but with a decent DM ahead of him he's fine.
@spursycob @adamdnathan @adammanson Quite an exaggeration. Dier, Vertonghen &amp; Rose are decent PL players &amp; Dier could be very good.
Was expecting big things from Kane today after his sharpness returned last week, but he was barely involved. Eriksen failed to link things.
@adamdnathan Yeah agree he was bad for the goal, and I don't want him starting ideally but he's a reasonable back-up player.
@Wizward @Its_stu Bentaleb still ball-watches a bit too much, but by god he's going to be some player.
@Wizward @Its_stu Yeah, they're both good on the ball. Both are pretty imperfect off it as it stands. Need an extra body in there.
@Tomas_Cresswell He started great, looked a bit lost in the second half.
@Univarn A crazy amount of time on the floor!
@SeanTayTay It was, he has a reputation for it.
@adamdnathan I don't love him, but he wasn't *that* bad today was he?
Ref too easily conned by Mane; he's taking charge of the cup final so expect his boss to have a word before then &amp; some yellows dished out.
Lucky to come away with a point there really. Decent result considering three or four players didn't show up. Dier arguably our best player.
Honestly, Mane should have been sent off for simulation today. Three very obvious dives.
@SeanTayTay Shows what they think of Yedlin. As it is Chiriches has gone to CB.
Mason (90%) and Bentaleb (89.9%) retaining respectable pass completion despite plenty of pressing in midfield from Southampton.
Looks like a dislocated shoulder for Davies. Vertonghen to left-back, Dier into the middle, Chiriches to right-back?
Another great pass Dier. Credit to Pochettino - I said first half that Chadli wasn't running in behind Clyne. Switched to other side: goal.
@MC_of_A I don't think we're going to agree on this one.
Deserved goal from Southampton. By far the better team this half. Davies with a poor header &amp; then allowed cross to come in too easily.
Players and bench absolutely furious with Chadli there!
@MC_of_A ...be fairly safe if defended properly.
@MC_of_A Of course. But for me Mason's trying to do the right thing, slips, and then plays an inaccurate pass back. A pass that would...
@therealtommitch Agreed, for Eriksen, could even bring on Stambouli and push Mason a little higher.
There are reasonable options on the bench today.  
Spurs really haven't come out after HT. Look rattled, timid, nervous. Need a change in midfield. I'd be tempted to take Eriksen off.
@EwanRoberts He's been *awful* today.
@SebSB Yeah, he is a very decent player - normally more reliable too.
@SteveJMaloney YOU JUST LOVE MASON COS HE'S ACADEMY etc etc.
@Taylan_Gul He was trying to do the right thing and was unlucky.
Davis has to score there - Bentaleb was caught ball-watching as Davis ran in behind him.
@SteveJMaloney Thanks for the rational response!
@charlieparrish @GaffneyVLC Agreed.
@Taylan_Gul 
@ManVsSpace ...felt bad for him slipping when trying to keep the ball?
Panel in the studio agree with me re: that being on Davies rather than Mason. 90% of Twitter disagrees!
@charlieparrish @GaffneyVLC He misjudged the ball forward mate and got too tight and so made it easy for Mane.
@hotspur423 I agree, mate, but majority disagree.
@thejameswallace To keep possession.
@adamdnathan I disagree. It looked bad because he slipped - had he not he had a ball on to get us out.
@shaunlewis17 They really are.
@cormaclordan He's done well today.
It's inevitable that this will lead to a mistake or two, you just have to hope you get away with it. We didn't. Mostly due to Davies IMO.
Reaction to Pelle's goal was "why didn't Mason just clear it?" Answer is: we've *constantly* played out so far. Bravery in possession.
@BillyMacfarlane Haha, you may have noticed that I *love* a proactive sub!
Lovely ball from Dier! Call me biased, but I think we've deserved that on the balance of the half.
Chadli's picked up since that tweet - lovely cross for Mason just now and then another decent run. More of that please!
Chadli is getting no joy in behind Clyne and, since his creative passing skills are essentially zero, we might as well take him off at HT.
@GaffneyVLC Had an opportunity to make a tackle, didn't take it, Mane beat him so easily and then had to wait for support.
About four mistakes for the goal - Vertonghen very slack vs Mane, Mason's slip, his subsequent panicked pass, Davies letting Pelle in.
Mason's slip there reminded me a little of Dawson's slip at Wembley. So unfortunate. But, regardless of that, Davies should have stood firm.
@BardiTFC Ward-Prowse is worth finding a place for for his set pieces alone.
Lamela with a great opportunity to run at Southampton on the counter but he really lacks a second gear. Needed to offload sooner.
@iainmacintosh Yeah, two back-up full-backs today. Chadli is back to 'lethargy mode' today too. Frustratingly poor work rate.
This is fascinating, two teams forcing one another to be exceptionally brave in possession. It might take a mistake to break the deadlock.
That's a clear yellow card offence from Schneiderlin. Stopped our break cynically.
Already clear to see that the Newcastle game has given us a much-needed confidence boost. Players taking the ball in tight spaces.
*Silence silence silence* ROAR! Probably inappropriate but I can't help but love it. #COYS
Paulinho's wife is having his fourth child? Well at least he's prolific in one sense, I guess. Congratulations to him.
@MC_of_A They seemed to sit off quite a bit against Stoke so it'll be interesting to see their tactics.
@spursfantommo84 @BenPearceSpurs A glorious Enfield crowning.
Paul Scholes - my all-time favourite non-Spurs player - saying nice things about Ryan Mason is like liquid gold being poured into my ears.
With that haircut, Bentaleb means business today.
Feel quite positive - Kane seemed to have his spark back last week &amp; I fancy him to score at least one. Work-ethic in midfield essential.
LIVE on #Periscope: Pre-Match Guff 
@gerbret In my top 3 players this season.
So what @gstobart implies is that he's burnt his bridges with some players deliberately. Which is calculated but slightly risky.
Re: @gstobart's article, from Pochettino's welcome from the Southampton staff it's evident that he's not a cold person in general.
@TopDiv Some things are far more important than football!
Aha, this is why there's no Paulinho. 
@Kaneology Twice the player. More talented, more athletic, better fit into a team, better attitude.
Intrigued that Paulinho's not even in the squad after a better performance. Also, Rose is quite a big loss.  
@Kaneology Maybe, but it's really hard to tell. I always thought Kasim was better in midfield and he has gone on to make a decent career.
@gstobart Very interesting. He was always portrayed as quite 'matey' with the players at Southampton (e.g. 
@Kaneology He just wasn't that great. No team ethic, etc. Played for himself, and not good enough to justify that.
@jair1970 Yeah that's fair.
@jair1970 This isn't great: 
@SGEndersby Oof.

@Towno10 Looking sharp!
'Highlights' of our U21s' 3-1 home defeat to Liverpool last Friday: 
@BuddhaChang Yeaaaaah
@JME_Watts84 He's so talented. If he gets his head straight he could go right to the top.
@Ryan_Chaloner89 I've only seen him once but heard a lot about him and know he's very highly rated. £4m or so should do it.
The Newcastle fan protest against Ashley continues - good for them. Protests at Swansea match &amp; SportsDirect stores. 
Marcus Edwards in the U17 squad. Was hoping Kazaiah Sterling would be in there too - I think he's deserved it. 
@THFCSPURS19 That sucks. He even scored two at the weekend. But no I don't know.
@llojaco Ooh where's that mate?
@Daily_Hotspur @SpursViews_ He's a cracking player, bound to play Premier League football at some point.
@GrumpyYid @LoveTheShirt @Flav_Bateman Great shout.
@therhinospeaks @lilywhite_rose My favourite bit is 'put it all in my little backpack'! Adorable.
@tommyyeomans Wahey, cheers mate!
@jccy1101 We might get another year out of him.
@tomedwards Nice one! They're both excellent too.
@bigbarney100 I'm not sure about that!
@AT_Spurs @lilywhite_rose Suspect he'll go out on loan next season...
@huss_THFC Excellent! Great to see (although I don't like 'click through' formats). @tomedwards was this anything to do with you? Nice work!
@philmoomp Always loved 'Coming In From The Cold'.
@philmoomp It was! I used to like them.
I just thought of Agustín Delgado for the first time in years. He wasn't great, was he? Southampton have come a long way since 2001.
@Finallypritch Re: oligarch: 
@Finallypritch He's that good that it seems unlikely!
@IainLiddle It's just weird. He's so good that he'll inevitably move on to a massive club, and he deserves that.
@pete_turner23 Edwards is widely seen as the biggest talent.
@James_shaw11 My gut instinct says that it's unlikely. Both are good but not great as it stands.
Re: Lloris: worry about it when it happens. Until then, just enjoy him. We might never have a better goalkeeper in our lifetime.
@LesRosbifs @DoronSalomon That's lovely to read.
@pete_turner23 I'd think so, those goals are from midfield mostly I think!
@James_shaw11 Both are really excellent prospects, all being well they should be Premier League level players.
@bernardthfc Me too! Perhaps a year off that, but we'll see.
@pete_turner23 I hope he's involved in pre-season.
@stuartlkearney I'd use him in some games.
@JuiceYoda Sure has!
Our U16s lost today but Mr Roles scored again!  
Cameron Carter-Vickers started for the USA U20s today - they drew 2-2 with Qatar. 
Two more assists for Dele Alli tonight! He's finishing the season very strongly. MK Dons beat Doncaster 3-0 and he played the full 90 mins.
@NotSoWorthy @Flav_Bateman @LoveTheShirt That cut deep.

@Billie_T Kinda nuts that Paulinho got MOTM when Bentaleb and Rose (and Vertonghen) played so well.
@Billie_T seen this yet mate? 
Bentaleb played really well vs Newcastle. Some incisive passing. 
@ClassHotspurs Totally agree.
@lilywhite_rose Interesting, he'll do well to get a move there.
@LutonNews_LTFC Apparently he has a hamstring injury and has returned to Spurs :)

@G_Fro @LoveTheShirt It'll be 7ish.
@smallsTHFC88 @scottdougie Would be great but apparently he wants a move to Man Utd.
@G_Fro @LoveTheShirt Will do mate!
@WastedP0tential OK, if you can give me as much notice as possible I'm sure we can sort something. Keen to get rid of the box!
@AT_Spurs @hotspur423 Exactly that. Eriksen was the on doing it vs Villa but he had about three roles to fulfil which didn't work well.
@hotspur423 Yeah, Dier saw a lot more of the ball than Rose.
@BardiTFC I meant more Lamela and Chadli tucking in... Eriksen had quite a 'free' role.
@Conor419 Which is possible...
@hotspur423 I felt Lamela tucked in a fair bit too. It was like a narrow 4-4-1-1 at times.
@andyperry79 He did, but Dier saw more of the ball. I thought he had a reasonable game.
@Conor419 Only if Liverpool finish outside the top 6, right?
@Alex__David And Lamela too!
Is it me or have we seen signs of Pochettino's lopsided 4-3-3 in the last 2 matches? One of the wide players tucking in depending on phase.
@Towno10 WHAT?!?!?!?
@WastedP0tential I'm near Uxbridge mate. You ever up this way?
@MartinCloake Either 'Quote Tweet' using the official app or just paste the link to the individual tweet.
@WastedP0tential Hello mate, am on the podcast again tomorrow if you're around?
@gp6970 
@Baumee Me too!
@KennyPalmer @ManVsSpace Yup. Paulinho at his best is just about better than Mason at his worst.
@KennyPalmer @ManVsSpace He did fine today, I've not criticised him!
@Univarn That's all we can hope for.
@MyoyuMal @vkon1 I agree and prices are irrelevant to me but I was using it to make the point that he's not playing at that level.
@vkon1 I know mate, but you see the point I'm making? He did fine today but it was at a £6-8m player level. Livermore level.
@lilywhite_rose I'd go like this mate: 
@False_CB Apols.
@Skipjack0079 @AlienatorDr Yeah, I still think we need to change the system too long-term. A holder, &amp; a freer Bentaleb &amp; Mason/A N Other.
@Skipjack0079 @AlienatorDr No, I made the same point. I'd reluctantly keep that player in the squad.
@Skipjack0079 @AlienatorDr I don't think he was "very" good, but he was "very good for Paulinho". I was pleased to see that.
@Skipjack0079 @AlienatorDr Nope. He made a good one in the first 10 minutes to Kane.
Paulinho's failed passes were all forward ones. #NEW 1-3 #TOT (via @StatsZone 
If he was like that every week I'd be 'meh' about him - I'd think we had overpaid but I'd see a reason to keep him. But he's not.
Paulinho was basically Livermore today. Loads of leg work, pressed well, kept it simple. A cog in the team, but not a £17m one.
Some decent performances. Best for me were: Rose, Bentaleb, Vertonghen, Kane in that order.
First things first: Newcastle were/are awful, and that was just the opponent we needed to get a bit of swagger back.
As they walked off Rose was livid with Bentaleb about something! Bentaleb looked like a guy trying to make it up to his girlfriend!
Paulinho got MOTM! I mean... he was fine-ish... but... WTF?
YES HARRY!!!!!!!!!! Deserved that today, very mature performance from him!
@GaryRootbeer Mason/Bentaleb, Lamela/Dembele/Eriksen, Kane?
@djrattigan He's basically Livermore.
@JamesMawFFT Kane, Lloris, Rose. Easy choice.
Paulinho's corners are better than Eriksens' because he just focuses on putting it into an area rather than trying to whip it flat &amp; hard.
@DannyNay96 No agenda, it happened.
Rose goes off with a tight hamstring. Best player for us again today. Such a huge, huge improvement this year. Love him.
@Studub You do. Whether he's happy with that role is another matter.
Took Dembele 5 seconds to get the ball, turn 180 and pass backwards. But he was the right player to bring on.
Despite the missed chances, Lamela's had a *much* better half.
Two lovely passes from Bentaleb to open Newcastle up. He mostly played much higher for U21s, be great to get a DM &amp; let him push on more.
@idiot_wind_54 It buzzes the referee immediately if the ball's over the line.
@TomOfHayward Haha, such a hipster isn't he? "No way, Danny, I'm not playing you in, that pass is *so* obvious."
@GaryRootbeer Big improvement.
@EricMilazzo @SebSB Only if you touch the ball or block the goalkeeper's view.
Kane's hold-up play has been really good today, very intelligent.
@SebSB Exactly. I think that was the correct call from the linesman too - players are offside only if they touch it there.
And that is a nailed-on yellow there for a cynical foul. Referee bottled the second yellow for Colback.
@BCTHEGRANDSLAM Great minds :)
@DonSelektaa It was.
I don't care that he got the ball, that Obertan tackle is FAR worse than Lamela's first half which he got booked for.
@JamesMawFFT Quite right!
I called that offside in open play - looked fairly obvious. Vertonghen effectively punished for holding a good line. Poor decision.
@Gilzean498 Yeah, I totally agree.
@Phon1k Haha
@Conor419 @Studub @TomOfHayward ...instead he let it bounce off him then chased the loose ball like a puppy. I actually lolled.
@Conor419 @Studub @TomOfHayward There was a #PeakPaulinho moment where he didn't even try to control ball...
@Conor419 @Studub @TomOfHayward I don't agree with either of those statements but he's had a solid 6/10 game so far, can't complain.
@JayMarple21 @idiot_wind_54 I think Rose has been fantastic (again). Best player.
@BeniAsouODonnel He's been dreadful on the ball. Dreadful.
@bongsteve069 I'd be so happy!
And Paulinho's done a functional job too, he and Eriksen winning the ball back from a dallying Gouffran for Chadli to score.
As bad as Lamela's been on the ball (&amp; he's been bad) there's absolutely no doubt that he's helped us press. Chadli *far* more diligent too.
This is just what we needed - Newcastle have sat off us &amp; let us play. We've mostly played badly mind! Still, small steps and all that.
There's not a lot in that from Lamela - simply trying to block the pass. Krul and Coloccini trying to cause problems for him.
I know everyone's already said it, but Lamela's been pretty hopeless so far. He's already lost the ball 6 times due to a poor touch.
@kennywastell @Nikhil_Saglani @Mark_Lynch1 He didn't put it where he meant to (Rose made it a good pass), but the pick-out was excellent.
Chadli &amp; Paulinho both much improved today, but Newcastle have just been awful. This is just what we needed to build a bit of confidence.
@seanyc5 Really has been bad.
@Phil__Oliver Has done well off the ball, quite poor on it.
@Nikhil_Saglani @Mark_Lynch1 @kennywastell Yup, Paulinho and Eriksen get credit for that. But boy did Gouffran dally.
In other news: Paulinho gets the assist for a square pass. Gouffran too easily dispossessed in the build-up.
GET IN! Chadli has truly needed that! Picked up the ball, not a lot was on so he moved left and hit a left-foot shot into the far corner.
Chadli definitely seems to have a bit more urgency today in defending, wonder whether he's been told to up his defensive work rate?
Either Eriksen's mishit that, or someone totally forgot to do 'their bit' of the free kick routine.
@BardiTFC Eriksen dispossessed four times already and you pick on Lamela? This can only be an #agenda.
@djrattigan But he is wide right.
Totally comfortable with Paulinho playing more long, high balls as it means that's fewer passes he'll awkwardly bobble across the deck.
@stefanpape29 100%
Newcastle standing off as and allowing us to build from the back - makes life so much easier. Vertonghen seeing a fair bit of the ball.
@Ryan_Chaloner89 He's getting released mate, not up to it sadly.
Two things I'm pleased with already - 1. the pressing's back. Where had it gone? 2. We've made their defenders turn a few times early on.
@BainsXIII Haha I don't make any effort on Sundays, I just wear whatever.
LIVE on #Periscope: Paulinho. SRSLY? 
@NickGodwinsport @lilywhite_rose @BBCLondonSport Fitness test perhaps?
@pokeefe1 Not really, he's already made his decisions on the squad, just that he's been stuck with very few alternatives. They're knackered.
@gb2point0 Ha! Sounds like a lower-level Dawson! Thanks for the update mate. I wonder where he'll end up!?
@pokeefe1 To me it just shows how important confidence and momentum are - so much of this game is about psychology.
It's sort of reassuring to see West Ham playing like #Spurs have in recent weeks: no confidence, no obvious game plan, no spark or tempo.
@WastedP0tential On the podcast again tomorrow if you're around?

@AcSpurs21 Lamela's ceiling is way higher than Lennon's ceiling.
@riki_rikidance @BatfordMido He's fast, I'll give him that.
@king26ledley @TheTottenhamWay CM in a 4-4-2 yesterday no?
@JeffG15563 Ha, thanks! I'll use it on the podcast this week.
@Sam_Clark_10 I reckon he'll get game time.
@greg_jenner Cheers, will have a listen!
@BenMElliott Width mostly comes from the full-backs in our system.
@Perdesthai Lamela has the higher ceiling by miles, easy to see why he's been kept over Lennon.
@therealflannerz @GaffneyVLC I'm not convinced. People think Mason vacates CM too much - Holtby did that far more. Also fades on 60 mins.
@GaffneyVLC Capoue being one of these. Apparently he was abysmal for U21s on Friday.
@tilts79 At the expense of not pressing, though. Protects full-back because he starts deep and breaks forward from there.
@gb2point0 Haha!! At fault for either goal?
@paulquinton @MalaysiaSpurs Lennon has an almost unparalleled ability to get you off your seat and then put you instantly back on it.
@unfitforpurpose So true.
@Sumeer1000 Personally I don't. But obviously would rather have him in the squad than Paulinho!
@bbqbobs Townsend mostly gets hate from what I see.
@Vocalspurs No doubt.
@spurs_sel I don't think it's ever been clarified - there could be something in the deal that says it's reliant on Hamburg not going down.
@lilywhite_rose Haha, I know! People get so desperate.
@arunspurs Mirallas has a bit of an attitude problem I believe. As an aside, he was lucky not to get sent off yesterday. Did you see?
@andyperry79 Crazy. He's done well in the last few games, little before that and very inconsistent for us prior to the loan.
@bernardthfc Spot on.
@PeteDomican Lennon wouldn't have improved us IMO. But yes, certainly an area to fix.
@djrattigan Obviously yes. But I'm sure they'd have got rid of Paulinho too had they had offers.
@dwallm It does!
@GAV_GWA I know I was alone but I didn't think he was great. He's always faded around 60 minutes too. Fitness issues.
@ChezJon I think he might well be - certainly see him being involved in pre-season.
@BatfordMido Haha!
@Brad_Pinard Absolutely.
@kittyvillageboy #COYS
@11dollarsmills He can play CM or CAM - imagine he'd play 4-3-3 and Pritchard would be a wide rotation option.
@Mark_Lynch1 Thanks for this Mark! He's definitely not a future Spurs player, hope he makes a decent career for himself though.
@TheTottenhamWay I'm watching it now!
@LutonNews_LTFC Hi there - do you know why Oduwa wasn't involved yesterday? Injured?
@LeeroyJenkwoo @TheloniousFilth @RickyTFC @Flav_Bateman @LoveTheShirt @HotspurRelated "As imagined by Dave Bromage". It's so unoriginal!
@DaveWebb8 How did Dominic Ball do yesterday mate?
@JamesMawFFT @Spooky23 @RickyTFC @TheloniousFilth James knows stuff.
Dele Alli's superb goal from yesterday, via @TheTottenhamWay: 
@Perdesthai You'd expect far, far more from a player who is so much better adapted.
@JeffG15563 Lennon has an almost unparalleled ability to get you off your seat and then put you instantly back on it.
@SuperSpurs1985 Maybe, but the productivity levels between the two aren't that different.
That's only marginally better than Lamela (295.6 mins - PL only) this season, who is mostly seen as nowhere near productive enough.
Great to see Lennon regaining some confidence, but over the past few three years he has averaged a goal or assist every 261 minutes.
The longer Lennon and Holtby are away, the better they become in the eyes of some of our fans. What next? Clamouring for Khumalo?
@TaylorandBesty We spoke about it on our podcast last week - many of our fans hate Levy but this makes me realise how lucky we are!
@TaylorandBesty Hope the protest goes well today lads, far more important than the match itself. I feel for your supporters.
@Razorrico86 @BardiTFC His tail is definitely up, confidence makes more of a difference than virtually anything else in football IMO.
@Razorrico86 A team playing with confidence against 10 men. That'd even bring something out of Paulinho.
This is great! Townsend's interview afterwards is amusing too. 
@I_Am_Wilco Haha no I'd not seen that!

@AdamOsper Nothing personal matey, just a little too much politics for my taste. I'll still be in touch.
@TheloniousFilth Awful human.
@RickyTFC FFS Ricky, theSPORTbible? Really? I tweeted this last week.
@armourme @LoveTheShirt Amazing.
@deanmurphy12 Nope, I didn't say that. I can see why he got a raise is all.
@deanmurphy12 Gazidis has a stadium which brings in millions and Champion's League football. It's arguably an easier job.
@deanmurphy12 The two aren't linked. I'm not thrilled about modern football either, but this isn't an illogical decision given how it works.
@deanmurphy12 He's obviously hitting (and then some) the targets set for him.
@Haywood75 We're all really hopeful about next season, just that the last few performances have been disappointing.
@Haywood75 @LoveTheShirt @Flav_Bateman It was phenomenal. The 'brilliant' re: Gomelt made me howl!
@deanmurphy12 Highest ever pre-tax profit recorded in the Premier League. Stadium plans coming together. Profitable &amp; successful academy.
@Haywood75 Thought we were quite positive overall...
@deanmurphy12 We've already determined that it's not related to on-pitch. Off pitch, question would be: who's performing better?
@THFCSPURS19 Eminem, Stan.
God, that's good. 
@Alex__David DM apparently.
@deanmurphy12 Is it not? Who should get paid more? There are too many variables to make it easy to say.
@chapmancmc Thank you!
@lilywhite_rose 
@kev_g1 @MrCracknell @davidcoates47 Agreed :)
@deanmurphy12 @MrCracknell @davidcoates47 If we took a massive downturn on-pitch (say we got relegated), off-pitch would go horribly wrong.
@deanmurphy12 @MrCracknell What I'm trying to say is that it's not beyond the realms that he gets a 'reasonable' amount for the job he does.
@deanmurphy12 @MrCracknell I mean... by rights the highest paid should be Burnley's Chairman... but they have a lot less cash.
@kev_g1 @MrCracknell @davidcoates47 Leeds didn't even get that far!
@flatkins Akindayini and McQueen. Ross from the U18s.
@thfcmojo @MrCracknell Alas, that's a totally unrealistic scenario.
@ADZMB15 @MrCracknell @davidcoates47 Course not!
@ADZMB15 @MrCracknell @davidcoates47 It's not Spurs-specific IMO.
Aaron McEneff trialled with Sheffield Wednesday U21s today - he's on the list of players to be released in summer. 
@MrCracknell @davidcoates47 If he was rewarded for on-pitch issues he might chase short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability.
@davidcoates47 @MrCracknell No such thing anymore, I'm afraid. I must admit, this pay rise doesn't bother me at all.
@MrCracknell Are the non-executive directors that decided this anything to do with ENIC?
@HarryG23 @LoveTheShirt FINALLY SOMEONE SPEAKING SENSE! In your face, Flav.
@paxtonlad I can't make it, sadly!
@andyperry79 I think it's unlikely, sadly.
@TheTottenhamWay It's possible, perhaps give him 45 minutes and then involve him Sunday?
@AlienatorDr It's possible, perhaps give him 45 minutes and then involve him Sunday?
@LouJayne1882 There'll be a younger side vs City I'd expect.
@BardiTFC No. Just no.
@AudereEstFace82 Nope!
@neilod1976 It's possible, perhaps give him 45 minutes and then involve him Sunday?
@Ginter28 OK - I was hoping to go along but the kick off time has been moved from 11am to 1pm so I can no longer make it.
@Mark_Lynch1 Thank you mate.
@BardiTFC He's been away with the US.
Miller might play wide left with Harrison or Akindayini up front.
Expect U21s to be something like: McGee; Walker-Peters, Carter-Vickers, Lesniak, Ogilvie; Winks, Capoue; McEvoy, Onomah, Azzaoui; Miller.
U18s play Man City tomorrow - I was hoping to go along but the kick off time has been moved from 11am to 1pm so I can no longer make it.
U21 squad: McGee, Miles, Amos, Akindayini, Azzaoui, Capoue, CCV, Harrison, Lesniak, Maghoma, McEvoy, Miller, Ogilvie, Onomah, KWP, Winks.
U21s play Liverpool tonight at White Hart Lane, 7pm kick off. Interesting that Capoue is in the squad (as are Winks/Onomah).
@rattday @Flav_Bateman YEAH WELL DONE FLAV FOR YOUR ONE YOUTH UPDATE I'VE DONE THREE YEARS OF THEM
@Matt_swan40 Thanks mate that's really nice of you!
@senorvivo26 In doing that it'd naturally be more 4-3-3 anyway (a bit like when Dembele plays there) so I wouldn't be against it.
@davidcoates47 Which one was that - that he's our best presser?
@Metcalficus @senorvivo26 So a bit like the formation vs Burnley where Paulinho and Mason were just ahead of Bentaleb.
@senorvivo26 4-3-3 with Winks or Onomah this weekend would make me so happy.
@senorvivo26 No - I actually think a few youth team players might spark the seniors into action - not wanting to be shown up, etc!
@AT_Spurs @LoveTheShirt Thanks very much mate!
@ehdannyboy Thank you matey! Apperciate it :) I was very paranoid before I listened back, but it was OK.
@jilllewis33 
@kev_g1 Cheers Kev!
@steveyeun If you're ever in London, we'd love you to come on our Spurs podcast. We're all big fans of the show! 
@layiddo @SDSpurs Unfortunately he's out of contract before then.
@SDSpurs @Kris_Spurs Out of interest, how would that work? Why does it benefit Seattle Sounders?
@SDSpurs Also it's possible that we'd have a Europa League game 24 hours later.
@SDSpurs We don't know it doesn't. Our coach has specifically come out against these trips.
@jilllewis33 I wrote about this for the last fanzine.
@prezbegone But our strategic relationship with the MLS will be, no doubt.
@prezbegone It's totally disruptive and undermines Pochettino's comments from a few weeks ago.
@shelleyj89 @tehTrunk Ha! Didn't they do this once before too?! I must admit I find the birthday tweets so odd.
@prezbegone Why's it not? Money? Great.
@bennosaurus Oh god!
@tanaysmith @JamesMawFFT @grafinoz Why?
@grafinoz @JamesMawFFT @tanaysmith ...which are promoted, etc.
@grafinoz @JamesMawFFT @tanaysmith Not really fair to divide the two squads up at that point - presumably he'd be trying to determine...
@JamesMawFFT @grafinoz @tanaysmith He might not be able to: 
@andersaas I can't work it out. But I'd be comfortable with him replacing Paulinho in squad.
@andyperry79 Of course it is.
@grafinoz @JamesMawFFT I just totally disagree with the whole principal, but not least because pre-season is so vital to Pochettino.
@andyperry79 Disruptive nonetheless.
@bumra1 I doubt it.
@SDSpurs They go for the money.
@MAshed18 DOOOO IITTTTT!
@andersaas They might, but then they wouldn't be getting a fair crack of the whip with Pochettino.
@bumra1 It'll disrupt pre-season. Pre-season is HUGELY important to Pochettino.
@MAshed18 The Lane! The Lane! Before it's gone,
@Spurs_US Ha! Oh it just had to be!
@andersaas Absolutely that. 
@SDSpurs Presume you didn't see this a month ago? 
@therealbenoles I think that tour sucks too. No anti-American sentiment from me.
@SeanTayTay Yeah, weird.
@TotalUnited Undermines the manager: 
@adampowley @JamesMawFFT Yeah, clearly not his decision. It's a shame he's given a bunch of quotes about it, makes him seem a 'yes man'.
@KentGoodrich Exactly.
@andyperry79 That's besides the point. It undermines what Pochettino wants.
@MAshed18 Cheaper than coming to the UK!
@B0yGe0rge No anti-Yank sentiment here.
@Spurs_US Interesting. Out of interest, how would that work? Why does it benefit Seattle Sounders?
@robburton84 Exactly.
@zappa97 @CallumHaymes It might be. I doubt we'll find out.
@SeanTayTay Because it undermines Pochettino mostly. It's everything - the travel, the disruption, the fact that it goes against his wishes.
@JamesMawFFT Exactly. And after his pretty high-profile comments too. Basically gone against what he said, which undermines him.
@CoryMizer Totally.
@ThadCollins Depends what we want.
@1LaneOnly @CallumHaymes He's not. And we're not. But this is stupid.
@TotalUnited Whassup?
@CallumHaymes That's how I feel.
@therealbenoles It's everything - the travel, the disruption, the fact that it clearly goes against Pochettino's wishes.
Get used to this sort of thing. Whilst great for our U.S. fans, this is a crazy decision.  
@CEspich47 @LoveTheShirt @Flav_Bateman I think Flav should just do the whole lot :D
@under_thecosh @Spooky23 @RickyTFC Was *that goal* the highlight of his career?
@THFPodcast Thanks mate, appreciate it.
@TheReal_Milo Thanks mate, appreciate it. Sorry I didn't get back to you before.
@dandearden He's another one that's not particularly productive - only two goals for Southampton.
@Nikhil_Saglani @LoveTheShirt @Flav_Bateman I'm taking full credit for this.
@BardiTFC WOOF!
My hosting debut, go easy on me. This week's podcast features @chicagospurs! #THFC #Spurs 
@HotspurAdi Slightly different in the books and TV - in the TV show probably Jon Snow, Tyrion and Bronn.
Does anyone else think Tyrion Lannister sometimes sounds more than a little like Victor Meldrew? #GameofThrones
@gp6970 Great to hear, thanks mate!
@king26ledley I like Carroll but he'd have to play as part of a three and Poch hasn't seemed to want to do that much.
@Univarn Dislocated his shoulder.
@JackofFabletown Oduwa.
@Nikhil_Saglani Yeah, converted from right wing/right-back.
@AlanWindham Pritchard normally plays wide left. Alli a traditional central midfielder.
@king26ledley It's going to be interesting to see. Alli's much more dynamic.
@Univarn I think we'll learn a lot from pre-season.
@RobSmartodds I suspect both will play a large part in pre-season and we'll go from there.
Finally, Khumalo played 90 minutes at centre-back for Colchester. They lost 6-0 to Chesterfield! Not a great day at the office.
Ward played another 90 in central midfield for Coventry. Fredericks didn't play for Boro; perhaps he's not yet fully fit after injury.
Coulthirst got a 90 minute run-out for York, but Oduwa wasn't on the Luton bench, and Pritchard missed out for Brentford through injury.
Away from Alli... Dominic Ball got an assist as he played his second consecutive game at right-back for Cambridge United this evening.
Excited to see what next season holds for Alli. 
@SimonPeach Yeah, definitely a little buggy. Slow too. Great concept, though.
@SimonPeach @JackPittBrooke I recommend Bebo.
@SimonPeach I saw you Periscoping! Nice platform, isn't it? Shame videos aren't archived for longer.
@DanLouw If one were to insert a tiny cub flipper into your darkest recesses I reckon you'd be tempted back into it.
@DanLouw I was speaking about you today. You may or may not receive a message from a very nice chap about a project at some point.
@DanLouw Don't do it, the quality of those shirts is so bad that your nipples will be red raw afterwards.
@TheloniousFilth @thekuntz69 I was only messing, it made me love it even more :D
@thekuntz69 @DanLouw @TheloniousFilth Seeing your two faces in the video almost put me off tbh.
So good (as always). 
@DanLouw Finally caught up with this. Ruddy brilliant (as per).
@osidedowney @Nikhil_Saglani Don't recall ever having had much to do with him, but he has blocked me.
@MAshed18 Everyone's entitled to an opinion, I disagreed with most of what (two of them) had to say.
@Nikhil_Saglani Tough lesson. Always do your research before committing!
@Nikhil_Saglani He's blocked me (oddly). I don't think I agreed with a single thing he said on there. Figures.
@Nikhil_Saglani I know next to nothing about them but won't be able to take them seriously after listening to this.
@Katspur71 Will be doing the same next week, it was fun. The high point was the cock jokes from @tehTrunk.
@THSTOfficial @Katspur71 @MartinCloake @e_spurs I've just started listening &amp; I'm genuinely open mouthed. Well handled by the two of you.
@WayOverDunne Not 1882 as such but loads of the usual faces will be in blocks 15/16. I can't make this one personally.
@TomOfHayward c) Clarkson has created a *lot* of new email addresses this week for his Twitter sign-ups.
Lovely goal from Keanan Bennetts for the England U16s last Monday against France (with thanks to @CarlItAsISeeIt): 
@kev_g1 @SwissRamble We're basically in the best place we can be without being bank-rolled or having the stadium built. No?
@kev_g1 @SwissRamble Was that what you took from it? As it's not what I took from it.
@smallsTHFC88 I speak about him on the podcast this week so I won't spoil it ;-)
Well done @dele_alli36! 
Unparalleld analysis of #THFC financial performance. I always enjoy @SwissRamble's fine work.  
@gp6970 Want to submit it as an article? 
@opuszczony Totally agree.
@danielcowan00 @Nathan_a_clark I kinda feel the same. Although his cheating on his girlfriend made me question his honesty a little!
@AnthonyAshton1 @Nathan_a_clark I wish he was as good at football as he is at social media!
@MartinCloake @tehTrunk And funnily enough about 5 people tried to get in the shop last night, fortunately not whilst we were recording!
@MartinCloake @tehTrunk If you download the Periscope app and follow me on there, you should see two videos :)
@JWTelegraph Gosh, you really have to feel for them. Not that I think Clyne's exceptional, but they might struggle to replace him.
Here's what Holtby was saying when he was confronting the HSV fans. 
@tehTrunk Will do the same next week too then :)
@_MedMusic_ @LoveTheShirt You can still view the video for 12 hours or so if you're quick... I'll do the same next week too.
@realdealdanny @LoveTheShirt @chicagospurs It was great having Spooky back!
@palmquac @chicagospurs @LoveTheShirt Nice to meet the lads tonight, very nice guys. You'll hear them at the start of the pod.
#COYS #ChiSpursLondon 
@HLNinEngeland @SimonPeach Mind blown. And the Spurs players - as you'd expect?
@nceleski Haha! I asked, I was told no. What did you think?
@tehTrunk I dropped your name, though ;-)
@matbriscoe @LoveTheShirt Glad you enjoyed!
@tehTrunk What did you think? Work OK?
@realdealdanny @LoveTheShirt @chicagospurs Chicago's the Windy City right? Felt only right.
@Razorrico86 Haha! A mixed debut!
@123Teams @Flav_Bateman @LoveTheShirt I'll take that.
@Spurs_US @LoveTheShirt It's uploaded!
I can't share the link @chicagospurs but if you download the Periscope app and follow me, you'll be able to watch your boys for 24 hours.
28 people tuned in, that's more than I expected. Hope you enjoyed! @LoveTheShirt
Periscope broadcast in 5-4-3...
I'm hosting the pod tonight. We've got some guests down - lovely gentleman from @chicagospurs who I'll be 'Periscoping' with at half-time.
@ebbp Hahaha
@pete_turner23 There aren't many players I wouldn't take over Paulinho.
@Rixaldinho Yeah, I'd thought as much. Cheers!
@lilywhite_rose @AT_Spurs DEMBELE 7!!!!!
@lilywhite_rose Could be to do with the fact that relegation-threatened clubs want a 'fighter'.
@Ric_Aardo No chance.
@JamesCHarris97 So he wants to stay is what we take from that!
@kingkotcho I dunno, don't really think too highly of Holtby myself.
@PhilYiddo Hmm, but he never seemed to last more than 70 minutes.
@G_Fro We'll see how it comes out!
@BardiTFC @onlyonepk @LoveTheShirt @Spooky23 We'll make him into kebab meat.
@alijamieson It was a belter. @Spooky23
@DonSelektaa I think there are quite a lot of legitimate reasons for it - don't you? We'd played 13 more games than Villa for example.
@spurs_fanatical @therealshuban Nah, that'd be weird.
@Mark_Lynch1 Me too!
@delsutton I think he'll give him a go in pre-season.
@lilywhite_rose @AT_Spurs Must put him in our top 7/8 earners which is, frankly, a joke.
Going to try to do some Periscope broadcasts tonight during the podcast &amp; the mid-pod break. If you've got the app, tune in around 19:30.
@lilywhite_rose I wonder if there were conditions, though... i.e. if they stay up.
@kingkotcho In hindsight that was nuts, but Holtby's not up to it long-term either and Carroll needed the PL experience.
Lewis Holtby confronting Hamburger SV fans: 
@fuck_schwab It'll be interesting to see as the deal seemed to be agreed already.
@charlieparrish @tehTrunk @LoveTheShirt @Spooky23 This news most likely tempered by the fact that I have to host the damn thing.
@onlyonepk @LoveTheShirt @Spooky23 Inside.
@barnabyslater Windy@WindyCOYS.com :)
Looking forward to recording @LoveTheShirt tonight - mostly because our long lost comrade @Spooky23 returns! His first pod of 2015.
@WastedP0tential Hello mate, just wondering if you saw my tweet?
@DaveWebb8 Will he keep his place now? It's odd, never known him play RB before - only CB and CM.
@DaveWebb8 Pleased to see this as a Spurs fan - did he play right-back again?
@ellisallan_ Any chance he comes in?
My #FantasyFootball season has tailed off nearly as bad as Spurs' season. Yesterday I captained Kane at last min &amp; spent 4 points on Remy.
@Benandthebuses Me too, it may or may not take off but thought it'd be cool to try to use it.
Just did my first Periscope broadcast. Going to try to do something during the pod tomorrow too. It might work, it might not. Get involved!
@Benandthebuses Haha you joined in quick mate, did you get a notification?
@JamesMawFFT @tehTrunk @ebbp Of course! See, it makes so much sense. Just the type of experience we need.
@tehTrunk @ebbp But 1. they need more 'homegrown', 2. Argentinian link, 3. maybe they think he's close to not being good anymore.
@ebbp Go all in for Zabaleta.
@ebbp Genuinely thought he had about three good games for us. Admittedly they were important ones.
@ksterling_98 No worries. Raeyan - is that his first name? Thank you!
@ebbp We're gonna fall out.
@raaronovitch I was trying to be polite but that's what I'd have tweeted if I wasn't.
If nothing else we can just sing the Onomah song for 90 minutes every week. Do do do do do...
@mcr_thfc So if something doesn't work immediately you hit the reset button?
@kev_g1 Yeah, that's fair.
Oh, and it's time to blood Onomah &amp; Winks in the last few games. Give them 30 minutes off the bench here and there.
Stick by him, but by all means question. He's done some weird things, especially lately.
Some people want Pochettino sacked. It's like they've forgotten the previous 15 years and how constant churn has worked out. Hint: not well.
@JoshBrownSpurs @BenPearceSpurs Depends on the FA Cup final....
@Paul11Olson He looked pretty bad tbh.
@ftobloke I do. Mentally and physically exhausting for a lot of players having their first full PL season.
@eilif71 Mason just looks totally shattered. SURELY Stambouli should have played more?
@jelleman1973 Big words, and some kind of threat that under-performance will end in potential sales.
@oliabrams @EwanRoberts Yeah, I thought Lamela at HT was inevitable today.
@InsideN17 @EwanRoberts Maybe. At least he'd be another option.
@EwanRoberts Exactly. He's been hampered by those around him too, I'm sure. I can't work out how we get the best from him.
@George_S96 Indeed!
@CamchatkaFC It's a major head scratcher!
@Conor419 @EwanRoberts And even then, we probably should have just upgraded rather than not sold Sigurdsson.
@Conor419 @EwanRoberts At the time I was totally for the Sigurdsson sale. It's only in hindsight it's looked stupid IMO.
@Coyser Maybe, but I don't know if our full backs are good enough to justify it or our centre backs are so good that we can play three!
@EwanRoberts He's had a horrible few months. If we had a viable alternative he'd have been dropped ages ago.
Yes, January. We've got more work to do than one transfer window will allow.
Some of Pochettino's decisions lately have been baffling, but I'm not going to pass judgement until post-Jan transfer window next season.
Horrible performance from players and manager again. Burnt out, low in confidence, players making mistakes all over the pitch.
&amp; ironically, this has probably been a tactical victory. 4-3-3 getting better of 4-2-3-1, their extra man stopping us create.
Let's not forget that Sherwood got the better of Pochettino last season too.
Yedlin pretty close to giving away a penalty on his debut! Made a rugby-style lunge for Delph as the Villa man ran in behind him.
Soldado looks so rusty &amp; flat-footed. Not keeping him involved in recent weeks is fine, but he should have played U21 games or *something*.
@RobbG2B @journeymanhisto Well, I'd say ahead of him in the pecking order are: Walker, Chiriches, Dier. So Vertonghen being out helped him.
@journeymanhisto Injuries, David. That's all it is.
Yedlin on. Come on DeAndre! How wrong I was! 
@ChrisDoughty32 He's been awful for about two months, though - at his best he's great, at his worst he hampers us.
@jcifelli21 Grealish and Agbonlahor are wide.
@no1jib That was a kick to the throat, though.
Actually think we'll win this. We're a second half team. We need the kick up the backside to turn up. #COYS
@jcifelli21 Sanchez, Delph and Cleverley in CM.
@Conor419 His work rate is absolutely non-existent.
@WelshSpur07 @goatfaced I know it's not a popular opinion but I don't mind him there. Think he finds more space.
@jeremyhauer Chiriches has certainly given it away a lot.
@raaronovitch He had one really good run where he received it on the half turn from Townsend, but that was pretty much it.
I'd be so tempted to take Eriksen off too, but you wonder who else we have to create. Anyway, I want us to start by matching Villa's 4-3-3.
@Johnthfc The laziness is what drives me mad.
@Pete_Renn_Lnd So true.
@WelshSpur07 @goatfaced I'm watching Setanta. Eriksen and Chadli have rotated all match.
@raaronovitch They've mostly all been woeful in fairness but he doesn't even *try* to work back.
@Teflon6 Yeah all bad, but Chadli gives zero work rate.
@JamesBurf He did that once, took it on the half turn.
@ryantks Maybe, they've all been poor.
@True_Spurs I wouldn't want Lennon or Dembele in the team either.
@AaronWimaa Same.
@scrabopower Yeah, I'd bring on Stambouli for Chadli.
@Johnthfc Townsend started ok, then we stopped getting the ball to him.
@Kyle_Henchie_ All bad. Chadli for me is just awful right now.
@stylishriot He's been mostly anonymous for me. Eriksen nearly as poor.
@goatfaced Horrendous.
@svedalaspurs They're on an upturn of confidence, we're on a downturn.
@JiroSpyro Which other striker would you play?
@Dougie184 Just dreadful. Eriksen not much better.
@WelshSpur07 He's played centrally quite a bit but has been really, really poor.
@SeanTayTay Lamela is essential.
@djrattigan @M_C_Cassidy He didn't even really have a run then, Dan - Fazio just gave him 5 times the amount of space he should have done.
We've got various options at half-time, and most of them involve taking off the woeful Chadli.
Should really be two. Fazio beaten by Benteke in the air again, Agbonlahor turns Dier and then hits the post with his effort.
@JiroSpyro Sure am. Needs another two years at least.
@NormanGiller @_scottyboy_ He only said that because he's trying to give his two forwards confidence. Kane's better than both.
Kane hits (well) a speculative effort from about 35 yards. He must be so frustrated by the lack of service thus far.
@NormanGiller @_scottyboy_ Fazio's in the team for one reason - to compete with Benteke.
@jayjaffa I totally get that players take time to adapt, but his decision-making is pretty appalling.
A truly awful piece of defending from Fazio - gave Benteke too much space to the extent where he'd headed it by the time he was challenged.
1-0, Benteke. A great cross from deep from Bacuna, Fazio in no-man's land, Benteke angles a header into the corner with Vorm not moving.
Mason just tried a lobbed ball over the top to Kane. YES! Do this more! He was offside, but at least it got their centre backs turning.
Some of our players (Eriksen/Chadli esp) continuing their recent poor form. Good news is that Bentaleb seems back to his best. Beast so far.
@Conor419 No arguments there.
@GaffneyVLC People need to just accept that he's not the player he once was.
Kane's had 7 touches. Got to start trying to find him. This is so tepid.
@Conor419 First time half volley? Nah!
@BardiTFC Chill out, Andre.
Bacuna just had a shot to rival Paulinho's from last week.
Spurs now starting to dominate possession, but struggling for cutting edge. Eriksen and Chadli have switched positions.
The 3v2 Villa have in midfield already causing a problem (entirely predictably); Eriksen is tucking in even more than usual to compensate.
Eriksen playing wide left with Chadli in the centre. But it's already clear that he's playing off Kane as opposed to one of midfield three.
@king26ledley @TheTottenhamWay I don't particularly see either as changing a game, but I'd much rather have Dembele than Paulinho.
@traviscool91 @TheTottenhamWay Neither shoots well, let's put it that way. But Paulinho certainly gets into more goal-scoring positions.
@TheTottenhamWay The only way I can understand it is: "who's most likely to get a goal off the bench?".
@pwrichards1 Yeah, I think I probably agree.
@shepoftherhine Yeah, his attitude in general doesn't appeal to me - sulky, stroppy, believes his own hype. But I hope he's great!
@MC_of_A I'm guessing you're not happy that Dembele's been dropped from the bench? Clearly Poch has decided he's not for him.
@MC_of_A If Chadli/Eriksen/Townsend were pressing like mad and playing well it might just work but that's unlikely to happen.
Team news highlights: Fazio is back. Burnley 4-3-3 abandoned, Townsend preferred to Lamela. Chadli somehow keeps his place. Yedlin on bench.
@howveryspursy It's going to be fascinating!
@anwarthabet Believe we turned down £4m in January.
@TomMooreJourno That's very encouraging that you think that as I trust your judgement :) Kane always had the right work ethic.
@bernardthfc 2-2, Amos and Harrison, Amos sent off.
@AcSpurs21 Yeah, he sees things quickly. But it's much, much easier at this level with this much space.
@James_Tottenham Gray's finishing has been dire!
@JoshBrownSpurs Yeah I was wondering that but Jota on the other side has been constantly tracking his man.
@TomMooreJourno I imagine so. He has got a fair bit of swagger/arrogance that could easily rub fans up the wrong way.
@reverse_ball Not really. And in a Poch side it won't cut the mustard.
@cheggy1 Yeah, me too.
@sergiolucas1882 I think we'll judge from his pre-season performances.
@bongsteve069 Sounds like the sort of goal I'd expect him to score.
I'm wary of overhyping players like him as I remember Taarabt absolutely tearing up the Champ (19 goals / 23 assists in 44 appearances).
On the plus side he has a lot of strengths - excellent close control in tight areas, fantastic shooting ability &amp; a nice weight of pass.
Just now he tracked back to half day then pointed to Bidwell (at LB) to take over tracking the runner. Bidwell was already occupied.
...pass to him &amp; needs to learn to use his teammates better in the final third. 2. What he does off the ball. Barely been in own half today.
Pritchard still has two obvious weaknesses to work on: 1. he does tend to play for himself quite a lot. Gets frustrated when others don't...
@petespur Sums his performance up well :)
@bongsteve069 Any good?
@Bertinho_81 Beautiful strike. Still think he needs to do more without the ball. Has barely been in his own half!
@JackIngleton Yeah, definitely could do more without the ball.
@kev_g1 And he gets frustrated when others don't pass to him too.
Lovely, lovely goal from Pritchard, mixed half from him overall. Some superb touches, but some odd decisions with his passing &amp; a few dives.
@Univarn It'd be wide left or centre.
@jzash_ Seen at least three dives from him so far.
@OneHotspurWay Nope, literally nothing. But Ehiogu's been quick to temper expectation.
@kev_g1 He's dived a few times. I don't like that at all.
@Bertinho_81 Haha!
@Marky_Simmo We'll definitely see him pre-season and then take it from there.
@petespur He's actually been quite hit and miss today. Some poor pass selection and a few dives. Goal was lovely though!
@ChrisGnu Nah, very much right-footed.
@HotspurAdi I'd keep the 4-3-3 but I would totally understand that move...
@bankruptspurs Was adamant this would be accompanied by a picture of Lamela.
Lovely goal Pritchard! Cut in from the left, curled a beauty into the far corner.
@TomMooreJourno Was a beaut he scored vs Fulham.
Alan Judge on free kick duty today rather than Alex Pritchard. Pritchard did win that one, mind, with a *slightly* exaggerated fall!
@RenoWallabout @RossH1983 @unfitforpurpose He's 4th choice RB but Dier &amp; Chiriches might be needed at CB.
@unfitforpurpose @RenoWallabout Taarabt got like double Pritchard's goals/assists tally too so I'm trying to temper expectation there.
@unfitforpurpose @RenoWallabout Totally get that - Grant Ward comparison highlights it too. Not bad in MLS, doing great in Champ (at CM).
@GazFitzy @AdamOsper Not if you're suitably selective :)
@unfitforpurpose @RenoWallabout ...would rather not just throw in a young kid without allowing him to acclimatise first.
@unfitforpurpose @RenoWallabout Probably true but let's not second guess that the two things are linked. I'm open minded about him but...
@AdamOsper You've never listened to a podcast or read a blog?! You're missing out on so much good stuff.
@DannyT78 99% sure you'll be able to get some content for this old favourite: 
@bankruptspurs I mean, I'm no great fan of Spurs news accounts either but this seems really harsh.
@RenoWallabout "The pitch, although it looks flat, is quite bobbly and it took him a little while to come to terms with that."
@RenoWallabout Upgrade on: "I thought it was quite tough for him today… the wind… he won’t be used to that."
@RenoWallabout "He’s had a bit of a stop-start period because of injuries,” said Ehiogu.
@RenoWallabout “He did yes (feature during the game), he’s very good defensively and he’s still adjusting and getting game time."
@RenoWallabout Or internet person who heard Ehiogu say as much?
@Towno10 Haha yes I did! I'll stand up to applaud. <VICTORY HAND>🏻<CROSS MARK>
@Towno10 Sorry Troy, were you settling down for bed?
We can hope.
19 mins. Loose ball on right. Chiriches goes to ground, wins ball, picks up pace &amp; goes right through Sherwood who's stood on the touchline.
@Giacotweetz @stylishriot @TomOfHayward <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TomOfHayward @djrattigan That song was a Television rip-off.
@TomOfHayward Much like the man himself. Never known a guy wear such tight trousers on stage. Nothing to the imagination.
@bankruptspurs #plastic
@TomOfHayward Saw them a few times (for various reasons). Their fans were *such* unbearable tossers.
@NinjaArkRock The system said otherwise. How can I not back it though?!
@premierleague Beautiful shot, who took that?
@petercrouch Nailed it.
@Kris_Spurs @Flav_Bateman Haha how old did you think I was Kris?
@Flav_Bateman I got ID'd buying ale the other day. I said "18 year olds don't drink this". She wouldn't believe I was 31. Shameful.
@Flav_Bateman I genuinely think I would get ID'd for a lottery ticket when clean shaven.
@Flav_Bateman Gone clean shaven? Or just part of your face?
@onlyonepk I knew I could rely on you for some love x
@Mike_Andrews24 I hope they finish first and second!
My horses were carefully picked using an algorithm you wouldn't understand. Cause Of Causes, Balthazar King, Rocky Creek, Alvarado, Al Co.
With various scams and cashback deals I've managed to place £25 of Grand National bets and get PAID £10 for the privilege of having done so.
@ebbp I put out 3.7 times per week on average but you're only online 7% of the time.
This week's @GNev2 Podcast is well worth a listen - recorded immediately after Burnley vs Spurs: 
@ebbp @reverse_ball Stop flirting with me ffs.
@tehTrunk Didn't take long! 
@darrenyarlett Who's slow in that side? Other than Fazio.
@darrenyarlett It could be slower if you had Paulinho, Dembele, Chadli.
@darrenyarlett Apologies, dunno why I said Walker! I don't think it's a particularly quick team, but I don't think it's *slow*.
@RowdenJRSG @MC_of_A Was it that much?
@Mark_Lynch1 Eriksen?
@darrenyarlett Walker and Rose are both very quick. Dier's also one of the quickest in our squad.
@LouJayne1882 @poppydolphin22 Aww! Well I hope she catches a glimpse either way. Enjoy.
@BillyMacfarlane :) Won't happen, I'm sure. But we'll see.
@juicysushi :)
@DylanNoPants Eriksen?
@TobyFMinch I think I think so too.
@WarrenCres No, but not mentioned on official site? 
@thehuwdavies Yeah, him or Walker-Peters even. KWP is the more talented player, Yedlin more physically ready.
@DaviesShaun4 Maybe.
@tommymc93 Inevitable.
@ztranche I'm fairly flexible on which of those two plays.
@modrup Very laid back!
@AlienatorDr Fazio not mentioned on official site? 
@JLTHFC1 Eriksen?
@INSAeN I don't think so.
@grayhamp I think so.
@MC_of_A ...would be given license to press (with Mason), with Bentaleb the more natural 'sitting' player.
@MC_of_A I think most of those who saw the U21s said Yedlin didn't look ready yet, but I guess he'd 'do a job'. Stambouli for me...
@TaxiDave_ Not mentioned on official site? 
@Zigzag73 Would be nice. But him against the pace of Agbonlahor scares me a little.
@thehuwdavies Yedlin's not ready by all accounts. You never know, though.
Lamela or Townsend - not too bothered either way but I thought Lamela did well in his cameo against Burnley.
Stick with the revised shape, change the personnel. Chadli &amp; Paulinho shouldn't start based on their performances. Dembele or Stambouli in.
With that team news in mind, my team would be: Vorm; Chiriches, Dier, Vert (Fazio), Rose; Stambouli, Bentaleb, Mason; Lamela, Kane, Eriksen.
No Walker. Time to whip out the old fav. "Strolling up the pitch is super Vlad Chiriches, do do do, do do do do do." 
@JamesMawFFT What the shit is that?
@WastedP0tential Hello! I'm on the podcast Monday if you're available?
@Aggerscricket A lovely tribute, Aggers.
Richie Benaud was one of the voices of my sporting adolescence. A wonderful commentator who came across as a very genuine person. #RIPRichie
@tehTrunk Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast
@TurnCruyff @rtrssm @YedIin @stighefootball I felt the same about him at first; wanted to give him a chance. But he wouldn't. Stop. Talking.
@greg_jenner @LoveTheShirt Anytime you want to come on, just give us a shout.
@TurnCruyff @YedIin @stighefootball See if you agree with the points made. 
@YedIin @TurnCruyff Listen to @stighefootball on this week's @rtrssm and you'll hear that some Villa fans are sick of him already too.
@LoveTheShirt @greg_jenner YES! And make it a week I'm on so I can finally touch Greg Jenner.
@BainsXIII @tehTrunk #nominativedeterminism
@tehTrunk Haha! That's not a compliment, I don't want to be famous (or infamous!). But thanks for saying you love me, that was cute x
@tehTrunk Please don't say Better Call 'Sol' again, you've put me right off a fantastic show.
@BrinleyClark I'll be at my girlfriend's place so it might be a bit awkward!
@BrinleyClark Gonna be doing this myself during Monday's pod!
@therhinospeaks Aw, simpler times.
@SebSB @DannyT78 That's fair. Then I agree with you entirely.
@SebSB Maybe it's because Lloris (&amp; Krul) are likeable guys. As @DannyT78, if it's a more troublesome character the reaction is worse.
@SebSB I kinda feel the same way as you about it, but substitute Lloris and Giroud/Costa and I might react differently.
@ztranche £26m. I gather it was installments rather than 'performance related'.
@riki_rikidance @GazzehCOYS Carrick beats him in the areas you'd expect :)
@tomedwards LOL! Williams, Jagielka, Shackell, Eriksen, Livermore...
@pokeefe1 @martinsaidthis Definitely June 2016.
@riki_rikidance @GazzehCOYS Fair point - he compares well: 
@riki_rikidance @GazzehCOYS Re: losing the ball, not true. 4th highest pass completion in squad, 15/21 players dispossessed more than him.
@riki_rikidance @Lawrinho @Billie_T @TheloniousFilth I genuinely don't think there's a club in the league that wouldn't take Bentaleb.
@riki_rikidance @Billie_T @TheloniousFilth He makes mistakes &amp; isn't perfect but you don't see many 20-year old CMs playing as well as him.
@FinallySpurs_ Capoue will leave end of the season. Sherwood complained about his attitude &amp; Poch hasn't used him - speaks volumes.
@FinallySpurs_ Wow, I can't agree with that. Capoue's been pretty poor overall whereas Mason's had ups &amp; downs but mostly decent.
@riki_rikidance @Billie_T @TheloniousFilth I agree about Vertonghen. But Bentaleb's 7 years younger than Jan &amp; already playing at his level.
@TheloniousFilth No no no no no no.
@TheloniousFilth @Billie_T Goes by the name of Felonious Thilth. Mug.
@andymancini Highly technical player, really rate him.
@LeeTomPyo @TalkingTHFC Brentford have a good keeper already - ex-Spur David Button.
@andymancini What's he look like? Could be Winks.
@tommymc93 Same.
@spursblogger @Gilzean498 @asommerstad Yes, I doubt anyone stays on the page more than 30 seconds after initial click.
@TomOfHayward @ebbp Absolutely, they're extreme! Some of the managers I worked for were utter cretins too but I can't say too much on here.
@TalkingTHFC Yeah Ceballos is technically gifted but very inconsistent. 99% sure he'll be off. McGee's a talented boy - needs a a loan.
@bensonrecon Ha! That's some fine work, my friend.
@TalkingTHFC Thank you! Good for Winks to be involved. Ceballos expected to leave in the summer, kinda surprised he's there.
@ebbp @TomOfHayward Truly. What a culture! In fairness I have similar stories about my time at B&amp;Q as a student.
@TalkingTHFC Thanks for the updates! Which of the Development Squad players are involved?
@mdogfever "Soldado in the background" - *sigh*. Sums up his time at Spurs.
@Debaser92 Not cool, Etienne, not cool.
@SpursOfficial I've got a lot of love for Eric Dier's face.
@TheloniousFilth FFS delete this before @Billie_T finishes his morning lesson!
@tehTrunk @BardiTFC 1 goal in 815 minutes for US Pistoiese 1921 in Lega Pro - Girone B, you villainous troll.
@marcus_carlsson Phenomenal! HITC and Harry Hotspur now hidden! Thank you :)
@marcus_carlsson Do you have to register to do this?
@tommymc93 Yeah, although Twitter now becoming more tricky due to the hundreds of 'Tottenham news' accounts...
@SebSB @JamesDallESPN Goal used crap articles to become 'known' &amp; then re-branded &amp; made itself reputable. HITC presumably using same model.
@BardiTFC Check HITC for all the latest info on Yedlin mate.
@JamesDallESPN That is genuinely very useful information! Thank you!
Apologies. Needed to rant about something. It's been a bad morning so far.
Newsnow used to be a brilliant source for Spurs news and blogs but is now just litterered with HITC 'articles' which are total fodder.
HereInTheCity seems to be to 2015 what 
@ksterling_98 Morning Kazaiah - could you do me a favour? Who are the players wearing 7, 10 &amp; 11 in this video? 
@vkon1 Agreed, big step up. Hope to see him play in pre-season and decision taken from there.
@Gilzean498 I feel the same about him. It's my main reservation.
@AT_Spurs It's nowhere near as strong but he can use it.
@DuncanTucker Wouldn't it just!
@cccccameron Totally. Right way to be.
@jameswils Presumably they wanted to keep him?
@TomOfHayward Unadulterated joy!
@therhinospeaks Really mugged Oldham off over Tarkowski! I hear Mawson has been amazing for Wycombe too, he's had loads of offers.
@JackGodwin6 Sometimes players are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
@DuncanTucker In the squad for pre-season and take it from there.
@BillyMacfarlane That's my favourite of the lot!
Pritchard averages a goal or assist every 210.8 minutes, Jota 206.7. Two of the outstanding attacking players in this season's Championship.
Jota, who pops up a few times in the Pritchard video, won't be at Brentford long methinks. His goal vs Fulham: 
Oh, and speaking of Pritchard, Brentford released this today: 
@spudly77 He'll struggle to get that, that's part of the problem.
@james_THFC Massively so!!
He said with a little direction he shouldn't have too many problems with the Pochettino press. I came away very encouraged by that.
He said Pritchard's attitude has visibly improved as the season's progressed. A little questionable at the start of season, great now.
Had a good chat with my Brentford supporting mate tonight. He goes to all home games, some away. Pritchard came up, naturally.
@whufc_official @Flav_Bateman 
@spudly77 Yeah, I'm really surprised tbh. Always seemed a lovely lad who worked hard but a bit too timid on the pitch.
@tehTrunk @rtrssm @stighefootball Who would Sam fear more - Townsend or Lamela?
@CarlItAsISeeIt In what sense?
@MailFootball Martin Samuel's latest article (
@HotspurHurly61 
@djrattigan @TomOfHayward @TheloniousFilth Made him really, really angry?
@djrattigan @TomOfHayward @TheloniousFilth DANIEL RATTIGAN WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT
Man City, Chelsea, Stoke and Hull haven't given any. ht…
@AdamOsper Let's be honest, he never looked good. Although he looked *vaguely* functional, which is better than what we've seen lately.
@AdamOsper Totally agree with not booing but the others surely recognise that he's not up to snuff. Although doubt they'd say as much.
@BayBayBNC The article suggests we'd be supplementing Adebayor's wages at his next club.
@PranavAranha @TomCStandard I can't imagine Pritchard playing wide right too often but in theory he can play any of the roles.
@GaffneyVLC Ha, no doubt! BFFs.
@kev_g1 I mean, that's why he's reportedly in the job in the first place!
I'd been expecting Franco Baldini to stick around to help use his famous contacts and people skills to ship off some of the failed signings.
Another piece of essential lunchtime reading - @gstobart on a backroom re-shuffle/summer player sales: 
@PranavAranha @TomCStandard I think we'll find out in pre-season. My concerns have always been his workrate and ability to stay involved.
@TottenhamSweden Basically I don't think it'll be too much of an issue for us :)
@TottenhamSweden Mason, Rose, Townsend, Walker. But we have the likes of Kane/Carroll/Pritchard to include next year. 
Interesting from @TomCStandard on Pritchard. It makes sense to try to get him playing to instruction in pre-season: 
@jilllewis33 Maybe he feels too many just haven't responded to his methods?
@kev_g1 @BenPearceSpurs ...doesn't help. Full time switch to 4-3-3 gives more coverage in midfield meaning full-backs get protection.
@kev_g1 @BenPearceSpurs But now the season has taken its toll it's really hard for Bentaleb/Mason to cope. Chadli's workrate's dire which...
@kev_g1 @BenPearceSpurs I think we could cope earlier in the season when Eriksen, Lamela, Kane were pressing like mad to cut off the supply.
@ryandelarge Messaged them too! Thank you :)
My #THFC Inside Lane piece for @BenPearceSpurs: 
@ryandelarge So sorry, I meant the Kenny McEvoy quotes. Thank you!
@GoalComIreland Hello - are you able to point to where these quotes came from? Thanks in advance! 
@THFCacademy @TheTottenhamWay Just managed to listen. Nothing about a contract in there.
@TheTottenhamWay @THFCacademy I've not listened to this as I can't at work, but it could be where he says it: 
@pete_turner23 What makes you say that?
@thfc_tommy Looks that way... surprised!
@THFCacademy Thanks for that! I've asked the Irish Indepedent where it came from. 
@IndoSport Hi there - are you able to tell me where these McEvoy quotes came from? 
@THFCacademy Interesting, where was that?
@anton1882 @SamMorshead_ Aha so that's where it came from!
@jimmyjenkins Apparently not - see latest tweet!
Spurs have a 'first refusal' type thing on Luongo where we can match accepted offers &amp; also a 50% sell-on. 
@SamMorshead_ @11Goodie Aha - a first refusal type thing? 50% sell-on makes up for the £400k initial fee, which I felt was low.
@danielstorey85 It really is. They surely need an experienced old hand to try to organise and motivate them. A lower-level Pulis.
@kev_g1 Absolutely! But £2m sell-on cut would help.
@Pete_Renn_Lnd Yeah, same here. They might have been better off trying to stick with him.
@danielstorey85 He's clearly an immensely talented guy but should have stuck to technical coaching roles rather than trying to evolve.
I'm not sure if 1. he'll be given that time &amp; 2. getting best out of likes of Hayden Mullins is going to really improve them if I'm honest.
Moniz is a fascinating appointment for Notts County. The kind of coach that will improve players' overall ability. Will need a lot of time.
@marktimms2 That's Ward :)
@martinlaurence7 All of it. Every last bit. 100%. He'll have you properly motivated and we're playing like our players need a good sleep.
@martinlaurence7 I've just got this horrible feeling about it. It terrifies me tbh.
@martinlaurence7 Don't worry, Dr Tottenham has some sweet, sweet medicine for you...
@djrattigan Yeah, that could have been it. He does tend to favour players that stay behind during international weeks. Did Fazio travel?
@coys1901 @pokeefe1 4-3-3: Lloris; Walker, Dier, Vertonghen, Rose; Stambouli, Bentaleb, Mason; Lamela, Kane, Eriksen.
@PaulNardell @DJWalker11 Haha! I think it's analysing our various squads plus potential signings, so a little different to that!
@CallumHaymes Cheers Callum. Yeah, not so much now though!
@djrattigan Yeah, that's probably the reason. But why not just use Townsend (who he clearly likes) or Dembele or Stambouli? It's odd.
ICYMI earlier - I wrote about Pochettino's tactical inflexibility, touching on Burnley: 
@pokeefe1 I'd thought so but he has so rarely done it despite having decent options there.
@journeymanhisto Absolutely, essential he gets plenty of breathing space &amp; support from above. If players don't fit, get rid - no questions.
@gp6970 Brilliant, cheers!
@Billie_T @stylishriot @coys1901 @pokeefe1 Yeah, he &amp; Fazio the most 'natural' defenders we have at the club IMO - quite the warrior!
@Billie_T @stylishriot @coys1901 @pokeefe1 Would be happy to keep Fazio though as he's a great option to have against certain sides.
@Billie_T @stylishriot @coys1901 @pokeefe1 He's also made a few errors &amp; looks vulnerable playing high line. Prefer Dier personally.
@pete_turner23 Thanks Pete, appreciate it, especially as I've not had much other feedback. Yes, agreed - no judgements for now.
@pokeefe1 I'm not sure he's defensively switched on enough. I'd like to try 4-3-3 for the rest of the season, Eriksen in a free-ish role.
@Billie_T @coys1901 @pokeefe1 He's not been fancied since Fiorentina. Stambouli's the odd one for me, would like to see him get a run.
@LJFinClacton I watched it. Absolute waste of 2 hours! We nearly went to that, so glad we decided against it.
@journeymanhisto Yeah this is fair. Although we've not seen enough of that progression to convince me that his lessons are being adhered to!
@JME_Watts84 He'd be lucky to get £5m!
@pokeefe1 Hmm, not a formation I'd be happy with tbh. You potentially lose a ball-player &amp; invite doubling up in wide areas.
@journeymanhisto ...will allow players to get results, with long-term repetition of the same game-plan the aim.
@journeymanhisto Thank you, David! I think that's a fair point; perhaps that's what I'm trying to say at the end. Short-term flexibility...
@Vildaasen :) That's a fair point.
@james_THFC Me too, he'd be right for me with Townsend as an impact sub.
@PaulHajek Thanks Paul. We did indeed, Lennon did well that day.
@SpursManDan You'd think so - he'll have details of players suited to PL. Getting rid of players will be the trickier bit!
@JME_Watts84 Getting rid of players will be the trickier bit!
@TimmoTimson I don't think Azzaoui's ready just yet and Harrison I'm not entirely sold on. But the others: yes!
@james_THFC For me: 4-3-3 with Eriksen left. Stambouli in. Give him a run of games.
@Nathan_a_clark Got it! 
@Nathan_a_clark OK, will try to hunt it out! Cheers!
@robburton84 I think he'll play for us in early rounds of cups...
@TomOfHayward Haha! Would she have wanted you to have saved it for her? She's a keeper.
@james_THFC Chadli needs dropping for the rest of the season, dunno if he's burnt out or his head's not right but he's been awful!
@robburton84 You could well be right. I just remember a horrible touch on the left touchline and a loose pass too! I'm too picky perhaps.
#Spurs brought in Stuart Metcalf 2 months ago as Head of Performance Analysis. Previously at MK Dons so presumably worked with Mitchell.
@djrattigan @TomOfHayward 
@TomOfHayward I was pissed to be fair, I'd been out on a real ale pub crawl all day. Loads of &gt;5% beers, always gonna end badly.
@pezza1982 I totally agree with everything you say there, Perry!
@MagicJ44 Yeah I think that's where I'm at too - needs two transfer windows to get rid of the bad'uns &amp; get fresh blood in.
@james_THFC Thanks James - I think you might well be right. Personnel changes disrupted things, Paulinho disrupted attacking fluidity.
@TomOfHayward Haha! That's very sweet of you to say (I think).
@Nathan_a_clark Worth watching, Nathan?
@robburton84 Sorry, I'm with you now. Unlike most I didn't think Paulinho made much of a diff vs Leicester (excellent assist aside).
Dele Alli is playing for MK Dons again tonight - he won a penalty after 5 mins. Grant Hall has started for Blackpool too.
@philpete Haha! He was never noticeably skinny IIRC.
@Kris_Spurs @TomOfHayward I barely have. And I've only ever been tolerant. Weird!
@Billie_T Yeah, he's OK in small doses. Kinda like Peter Kay.
@HugLeBoss Ooh I like the sound of that!
@TimmoTimson Yes, want to see a couple of youngsters on the bench.
@CoysNews Absolutely right.
@JackofFabletown 4-3-3 for me. Stambouli in, Mason and Stambouli pressing with Bentaleb holding.
@robburton84 Which change was that mate?
@Debaser92 Beautifully put. I couldn't agree more.
@AlanWindham Yeah I agree, I think it's time to try Lamela again.
@bernardthfc It really is.
@spursrich100 :) Spot on!
@delyob Would be nice wouldn't it?
@haikuesday Yeah, probably a fair point. But at least we know Poch *can* do it.
@MagicJ44 I'm no expert either mate! But I think the fact that my tweet got 25 favourites show that there are plenty of like-minded folk!
@BainsXIII Keep doing it, it's a nice niche!
@TomOfHayward @RichArrowsmith @GaffneyVLC @djrattigan The Robbie Keane wife thing was appalling too. He's just a nasty, cynical individual.
@TomOfHayward I'm blocked. <OK HAND SIGN>
@Billie_T The gift that keeps on giving.
Probably worth adding that I'm generally happy with Pochettino &amp; would like him given another two years at least regardless of success.
'Plan B or not Plan B...': 
@BainsXIII It just reminds me of your Taylor Swift piece for some reason!
I've just written an article partly around Hamlet's suicide soliloquy. I've gone full @BainsXIII.
@hotspur423 @Zonal_Marking He did well in that Stoke game *for Paulinho* - some lovely flicks. Overall he was decent, nothing more.
@Zonal_Marking Neither have I. Keep meaning to download some Confederations Cup matches - he was named 3rd best player of the tournament.
@BardiTFC I hope there's a freak storm tonight and it wipes your flat (but no others) clean off the map.
@rapharris_ Not true anymore - starting position can be as high as halfway line, which many would see as a risk compared to 80s/90s FBs.
@rapharris_ Walker's attacking contribution is underrated - few players carry the ball as far up the pitch as him. Created goal v Leicester.
@djrattigan Totally agree with you on that but he had enough on the bench to change shape or approach on Sunday.
@djrattigan @Zonal_Marking Sorry, yes, in-match.
@therealshuban He's a superb little player - technical, quick, good finisher.
@Zonal_Marking You also picked up on what most of us were whinging about - Pochettino's reluctance to change things. An issue all season.
@Zonal_Marking "hapless Paulinho" - it almost makes you want to cry, not just as a Spurs fan. God, he's bad. Expected so much more.
I wrote a piece on Sunday for @BenPearceSpurs that will go online tomorrow; it's about the match &amp; our defensive shape post-Burnley.
Late to the party, but @Zonal_Marking did a great job as usual of summing up the turgid Burnley vs Spurs match: 
@stylishriot I thought he'd pulled out for personal reasons?
@ElNinoRules They made out last week that he'd only miss the one match...
