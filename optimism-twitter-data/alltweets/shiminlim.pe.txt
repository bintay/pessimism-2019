@zaynmalik @Louis_Tomlinson DID THIS REALLY HAPEN HAHAHAHA
@Tessaasimpson @madisonmrc ok well i've never been to europe so as long as we stop by the major europe cities im happy
@jennyfrmdablck_ think kylie jenner when she had her ombre that's the length that suits everyone
@jennyfrmdablck_ the safest haircut is always medium where it's at the shoulders/ a little longer and everyone suits that so you'll be fine!
@Tessaasimpson @madisonmrc ok i'll start saving up then im excited this has to happen!!! fill me in in all your europe plans pls
@jennyfrmdablck_ but just remember that hair grows back and who knows you might even prefer shorter hair i know i do :-) no regrets at all!
@jennyfrmdablck_ you're doing a very brave thing and i applaud you because i know how hard it was for me to cut and donate my hair :-)
@Tessaasimpson @madisonmrc how long u wanna go for??? how much money do i need for a month in europe lol
@Tessaasimpson yeeeaah! im scared that if i go longer than a sem i might not ever go back
@madisonmrc @Tessaasimpson i'll join for the dates during my uni break i think tessa is planning to travel for like 10 months hahahaha
@Tessaasimpson FOR LIKE 6 MONTHS PLZ

@Tessaasimpson i wouldn't wanna party all the time either i just wanna be an asian grandma tourist -- when are you thinking of traveling to
@ErinCaizley ah sweet! i'll look into it then :-) the thought of being alone scares me bc social anxiety hahahaha
@loz_fox i'll look into the easy pace/discovery plus ones then bc i don't want it to be too full on i wanna do my own thing
@Tessaasimpson u just like ur own space and doing ur own thing no problem with that are you traveling alone next year for europe?
@loz_fox OOOh i see which contiki tour did you do? im still trying to decide if i wanna do it or not :-( so many differing opinions
@ErinCaizley 52?!??!! wtf that's so many!!!! do you share rooms and stuff or do you get your own room?
tbh just wanna go to rome and get mistaken for a italian popstar and have a fling with an italian hunk
@ErinCaizley i was thinking of doing one but i wasn't sure if it was worth the money, also i'll be travelling alone = scary times
@ErinCaizley would u recommend any of the contiki tours?
@loz_fox would u recommend any of the contiki tours?
@loz_fox is this contiki???

@loz_fox hahahahaha im the same i like clean sheets and my own bathroom im such a diva
@Tessaasimpson i will! im not a big drinker and i just wanna release my inner asian tourist
@jennyfrmdablck_ hello, im pretty sure it was 20cm minimum
@Tessaasimpson OOOH i might look into travelling on my own then! i was srsly considering contiki but i think you've changed my mind
@Tessaasimpson which one did you do?
@Tessaasimpson srsly!!?!?!? i'd rather go by myself but im scared it'll cost more and that contiki will be cheaper......
@Tessaasimpson hit me up when ur thinking of traveling -- you did contiki right? was it fun? is it worth the dollar billzzz
@Tessaasimpson im thinking about dropping out next sem haha and ive only done one sem of uni so sad i hate my life
@Tessaasimpson i'll travel with u i hate uni

@Yuwei_ im so mad chinese fashion only gets recognition when people use chinese culture as a costume and these ppl are wearing kimonos.....
Emma Roberts with chopsticks in her hair. Nice. Awesome. Must be so proud.
Also pretty disappointed at the lack of Chinese designers that were showcased and worn at the Met Gala
Why is there no coverage on the Asian or Chinese women that attended the event? Fuck Beyonce's dress
Also kimonos aren't chinese you ignorant fools, fuck Met Gala 2015
Met Gala 2015 is so disappointing, they didn't even mention anything remotely Chinese except for it's food....
" Met Gala 2015: “China: Walking the Fine Line Between Cultural Appropriation and Fashion” " 
i've never read anything so true in my life
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. nice.
my friend wants me to be a youtuber ok no i have social anxiety and it took me 7 months to make a new post no thanks

"im gonna take taylor's advice and go left" lmao
@pstepps are you training to be a flight attendant???
@lolemilyy_ oh dude dw i got a shit atar as well but such is life i hope you get into occ therapy though!!!!
@lolemilyy_ media and marketing i don't really know how far that'll take me though and i already wanna drop out of uni and take a 6 mnth gap
@lolemilyy_ of course haha fk uni, what's your major?
@lolemilyy_ i wish i could skin through but i have a test tomorrow so i have to really know my shiieeet
@mardymanu i thought that too but then there were heaps of terminology and i kept forgetting them
@lolemilyy_ oH RIGHT
@lolemilyy_ i'll just half that haha i kinda cbf reading it now bc already 1:45am and i have a test at 11am and im tired
@lolemilyy_ HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR YOU TO READ 100 PAGES
@mardymanu do it nothing's stopping you :-)
@mardymanu don't even think i'll continue with marketing bc im so dumb when it comes to commerce and no interest whatsoever
@mardymanu work in like an advertising firm!!! kinda the best of both worlds i guess, i hate marketing so much i too prefer media
@shiminlim i hate unit readings
how long will it take me to read 40 pages
@mardymanu do you not want to work in media?
@mardymanu will in you to power through it and graduate next year then you might as well because you're so close to the finish line
@mardymanu oooh ok thank you! if you really hate uni and it's 'emotionally damaging' then just drop out but if you think you have the
@mardymanu so what happens if i only do 1 semester of my first year units? how do i do my sem 2 units in sem 1 next year?
@mardymanu i remember thinking about picking media law as my major glad i dodged that bullet
@mardymanu would you recommend me taking a 6 month break as well? i was thinking of dropping out during the break and return sem 1 next year
@mardymanu that's so soon! heeeey im majoring in media and marketing nearly the same as you haha
@mardymanu kinda wished i had a gap year but my parents are giving me that option now, also thinking about just pushing forward with uni too
@mardymanu when do you graduate and what's your major? im literally the same as you except i'm first year and i hate it
@mardymanu I wanna drop out of uni!!!! haven't decided though bc idk what i'd do for a year -- are you planning on returning?
life goes by so quick with uni i can't believe it's may tomorrow, high school used to take FOREVER
@mardymanu travel, see the world, experience new things

me after the new avengers movie: 
i want to have sex with all of them
@TodungLubis you fought and did everything you could and that still matters
baltimore though
using the excuse that nobody died from the heroin is like saying "but did you die" is a valid excuse for drinking and driving.....
the situation is very saddening but they committed a crime in a country where capital punishment is legal!!!! what do you expect!?!?!?
you smuggle drugs out of a country knowing the consequences if you were caught, they should've been smarter about their actions
people fail to realise that it's indonesia, they have strict laws, stop viewing indonesia as 'bali' and realise that it's a corrupt country
but the indonesian law is corrupt
HOW DO I HAVE LONGER CAPTIONS ON SNAPCHAT

@uhmangela if they didn't enforce their laws, then why have a legal system? why have justice? crazy
@uhmangela it baffles me that people are trying to fight it when it's basically written in their law, they have to follow it
why are people trying to fight over the law; it's not Australian law, it's Indonesian law, you pay the price for your actions.
@ameliejayy it's also very illegal in Indonesia, they brought the drugs in knowing the consequences
uni life is boring, don't get too excited kids

@jennyfrmdablck_ seriously baffles my mind I want to try it one day but I'm scared they'll make me cry
This girl I know straights up tells every boy she's into that she likes them and to kiss her and it's worked every time how the fuck
I don't understand how? I'm like 18 and I still cry talking to boys because they scare me and I don't have the lady balls to be forward
In all seriousness how are people so straight forward with boys, how can you go up to someone you like and say "kiss me" wtf
@GeorgiaDebono they're so bloody inefficient if I received an email it wouldn't be too bad but absolutely nothing :-( good luck though!

A real love story: one time on my flight to Singapore a cute boy next to me offered me his gum. We shared a moment. It was special.
@shiminlim and it's because Indians don't look "good enough" which is the most racist and fucked up thing I've ever heard
There's this club in Singapore where they don't allow Indians only if they buy a bottle, how fucked is that?
How do people club every night I don't understand

according to a drinking game I'm most likely to have sex with a girl and to have sex with a teacher :-) :-) :-) noice.
@peachyhary better because it's a whole new vibe and atmosphere and they're so much more fun than girls and they can help protect you ;-)
@peachyhary because all they will do is make you go to the bathroom with them and shit :-) also definitely go with guys the more guys the
@peachyhary that's when it's boring but go with people that are wild and fun don't go with someone who complains a lot
@peachyhary with drunk people dancing to really loud music, although sometimes the music can be super gross and the crowd can be really lame
@peachyhary OHH right ok well clubbing is so much fun, especially if you enjoy the company of others because it's basically a room filled
@niallantics original price so $400 for both let me know because someone else is interested
3 years, 3 fucking years and it won't go away such fucking bullshit
@peachyhary so good!! clubbing in Singapore is the best except there's so many sexual predators trying to grind up next to you
@niallantics yes I am! Are you interested? Because I need them gone asap x
@peachyhary I didn't end up going that day but I went last night!
THIS IS WHY I LOVE GUY FRIENDS TO PROTECT ME FROM CREEPS AT CLUBS
And our guy friends were so cute and protected us and got us into a huddle even though the sexual predator tried to pick a fight with them
It was me, 2 other girls and 3 guys and we're all dancing in the club and a sexual predator kept trying to grind on us girls
I can't dance for shit
Intertwined fingers fuck me up

Feels so good to be able to laugh with my guy pals again god I've missed the opposite gender
Oh well my loss
Honestly the biggest thing I've learnt from tonight. I was given a chance but I brushed it aside and now I semi regret it.
Even if you're not too keen on the idea just jump at the opportunity because you never know what could happen
Hello it's 5am and I've learnt a very valuable lesson, don't be afraid to try new things because you'll regret it later.

So I landed 5 hours ago and now I'm back at the airport waiting for my next flight and im running on 4 hours of sleep someone help me
Schoolies game still strong

Hi if you're in year 11 and you do 3AB Maths, Politics &amp; Law and Ancient History hit me up because I have some goodies to sell!!!!!!!!
@eIz_xo are you done with exams yet?????
@eIz_xo CAN I COME OVER TOMORROW TO PICK UP THE TOP OR SOMETHING
I'm ready to get drunk
I DONT EVEN CARE WHAT I END UP WITH AS AN ATAR ALL I KNOW IS THAT IM DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL BULLSHIT
HAHAHAHA FUCK YOU WACE IM DONE WITH SCHOOL FOREVER
GOOD MORNING TODAY IS MY TIME TO DIE
I never want to have two exams on the same day ever again I'm not emotionally stable enough for it
You don't know what stress feels like until it's the night before your 2 three hour long exams that are not related one bit
@frecklenouis it's probs the game not the player
I thought my exam ended at 5:30 im an idiot
@beingtottyx productive ancient study you got going on <WINKING FACE>
@frecklenouis people are annoying
@frecklenouis honestly no h8 bc i've been guilty of it before but at least i don't upload 100 seconds of it like wtf who does that
@frecklenouis GOOD TO KNOW YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD NIGHT BUT NO ONE ELSE FUCKING CARES + IF YOU'RE HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME GET OFF YOUR PHONE
@Kimthawesome anyway im good friends with the band because i went to school with them so let me know if you see them live! they're cool
@Kimthawesome hahaha im sure you've heard of them! they're always performing in sg and with local bands like gentle bones
Tbh IDC if you snapchat the party you're at a few times, but PLS I don't want 300 seconds worth of your God damn party shenanigans
I don't trust people who only snapchat half their face
Absolutely appalled with the timetable this year, they should've spread the sciences and humanities apart instead of clumping them together
Ancient History and Politics are such heavy humanities subjects, and require lots of essay writing. They should instead put a science.
I actually want to email and complain to the curriculum council putting ancient history and politics on the same day is so fkn stupid
@Kimthawesome do you know/have heard aspectrum???????
@Kimthawesome OOOH do you like gentle bones/local bands?
Why I ever wanted to leave this place is beyond me

@ashtonostalgic why are people so inconsiderate
She literally belittled me for suffering from anxiety

@lirryplss actually so disgusting and it makes me so angry because some men enjoy that shit?
Soz just having a rant bc some chick on my timeline is shoving fruit up her hooty hoo
Do you really think a dick pic or you boasting on how you can make a girl cum in 3 seconds are going to make me want to take my clothes off?
No we will not send you nudes. No we do not enjoy being called sluts. No you may not talk to us in such derogatory language.
And it's upsetting knowing that 12 year old boys think that it's ok to treat women like dirt because of what they've seen on porn sites
I hate how much pornography sets out an unrealistic view on women
Angelina Collins I hope your parents are proud of you :-)
@relishlouis it depends on the situation, sending a nude to your boyfriend and putting your nudes on your story are completely different
Some girls really need to learn self respect
@lolemilyy_ that's good! I was literally 1 away from passing hate life

@frecklenouis if you don't like it in year 11 then don't continue with it, it gets so much harder and it requires a lot of attention
@frecklenouis so if you already take subjects that requiring copious amount of memorising eg ancient history then I wouldn't recommend
@frecklenouis and regrets bc it's all politics there's some legal stuff but not a lot which is super lame there's also a lot of memorisation
@frecklenouis um I battle with that subject, if you don't like politics I recommend not taking it, I only took it cause I like law studies
@eIz_xo haha yeah studying hard or hardly studying hmmmm
@eIz_xo literally my predicted atar is shit and I have 0 motivation
@eIz_xo ahhhh well hopefully once wace blows over everything will be better, it's just temporary, no it's ok!!! I'm super stressed haha
And she posts shit like "I miss my short hair" what? Your hair is still short? Just take your weave out? Girl R u playin dumb?
Kylie Jenner has been annoying me lately like we get it you have a weave
@eIz_xo oh no I'm so sorry to hear :-( is it because of wace or are they just being buttheads????
@GraceLamont09 I will!!!! you should I love short hair it spices up your style a little bit haha I sound super lame but it's true
@GraceLamont09 yes this is most definitely insta worthy! and if you ever consider cutting your hair short you should, it'll suit you so well
@eIz_xo dude where have u been and why haven't u been replying to my texts/tweets

@glitterminou ps big fan of your icon btw
@glitterminou I hate the world I literally can't do anything without being judged
Ugh how do I stop liking an asshole
I'm just upset
WHY DOES IT MATTER IF SOMEONE HAS SEX OR SOMEONE WHO DOESNT HAVE SEX? Why can't everyone just appreciate everyone on the same level ?????
Not that I'm planning on taking any bra selfies but I just don't get it and it really bothers me!!!!!!
But let's say if someone like me does it girls are like "wtf what a whore" or boys will tell me to "put some clothes on"
Like this girl who has the worst reputation posts a selfie in her bra and all the boys and girls are like "omg so hot <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>"
Why does someone who has a rep for sleeping around get to post bra selfies but if someone who doesn't sleep around does it they get shamed
Do you know what I don't get?

@gabzstopper hahaha yeah that's true! Just sucks bc all unis care about are your God damn atars which doesn't reflect me as a human being
@shiminlim good eng Shimin
I guess openly admitting my affection to him will finally help me get over something that never ended up happening so it's nothing
@eIz_xo can't believe I just admitted that he is indeed the bae of my life sigh boys

@shiminlim also rubbing of back is also very good yes
@ewalysha get it gurl
@shiminlim like it doesn't have to be a romantic gesture? It can be like a "I love u so much as a friend" kind of way
Guys need to kiss girls on the head more often when they're giving girls hugs

One day I'm going to read the singaporean constitution and just laugh
Anyway so yeah Singapore sucks and basically thinks that rape is only when a man forces himself into a woman and not the other way around
@relishlouis yeah I'm not emotionally stable enough to handle such cases I can't even deal with exam stress without breaking down haha
@relishlouis there's too much pressure and stress as a criminal lawyer sigh
I just want to fight for justice :-(
I want to be a criminal lawyer so bad I want to help achieve justice but I also don't want to be one ugh
Why do they have to define rape as penile penetration of a vagina??? Women can rape men???
And apparently even underage boys such as a 15 year old boy cannot be a victim of rape that's disgusting
@gabzstopper SOZ I MEANT VELVETGH0ST
It's saddening to hear how backward Singapore is, rape is basically nonconsensual sex regardless of the gender
Did you know in Singapore rape is defined as penile penetration of a vagina so that means men cannot be victim of rape... That's fucked

“@oohlalahaz: Not okay at all, whut the fuck. 
@cIarevoyant tell me about your boy <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@cIarevoyant but it's painful because what's the point in liking him if nothing is gonna happen it's just gonna hurt me even more :-(
@cIarevoyant we both said we can't be in a relationship because our futures are unclear and that we will probs be in diff states for uni
@cIarevoyant nothing I'm literally not getting anything out of this and so there's no point liking him bc too painful
@cIarevoyant CLARE HELP I DONT WANT IT TO HAPPEN ANYMORE TOO MUCH PAIN
@cIarevoyant YES :-(
@cIarevoyant BUT I LIKE TO TELL MY BRAIN THAT I DON'T LIKE HIM BUT I PROBABLY DO LOL IDK I HATE FEELS
@cIarevoyant I DONT KNOW IF IM STARTING TO LIKE HIM AGAIN OR IF I'M ALREADY THERE
@cIarevoyant he sounds beautiful the guy I like(d) plays guitar and sings too haha ugh must be a 1d fangirl thing hahahaha
@cIarevoyant I am so happy for you
@eIz_xo :-(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
@eIz_xo but i like talking to him bc it fills me up with so much happiness and i enjoy our friendship god damn it boys
@eIz_xo when he talks to me i get so happy but when he doesn't i get so sad and i need it to stop or else i'll fall back into liking him
@eIz_xo THERE HAS TO BE A WAY I DON'T WANT TO START LIKING HIM AGAIN BUT I KNOW I WILL AND IT'S SO HARD
SERIOUS QUESTION HOW DO YOU STOP LIKING A GUY YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH WITHOUT DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM THEM?
i am such an idiot why did i have to like a guy long distance lol pathetic/10 i just get too attached someone help how do i stop it
@johnnifer_ who knows! he's probably thinking about you right now ;-) give it time crushes take a while to develop
@lmaocassandra @loz_fox well when you like someone tell them bc it's good to release all those feels and who knows what could happen!
@johnnifer_ @lmaocassandra same here! i am honestly the most anxious person u could ever meet i was shaking when i told him haha
@johnnifer_ I hope you guys become a couple soon ;-)
@loz_fox shh loz don't tell them that give them hope haha
@johnnifer_ haha thank you! yeah man but the downside is i overthink things i guess that's the complications of being a girl :-(
@johnnifer_ I applaud you for your confidence bc it took me until year 12 to actually confess to a guy haha so hats off to you
i love telling people about how i told the guy i liked that i liked him bc i felt so brave for once and i had so much confidence
@lmaocassandra LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS ANYMORE AND LIFE IS SWELL
@lmaocassandra you know he isn't the bae haha and it helps with moving on trust me you should do it bc u feel so much better!!!
@lmaocassandra and who knows it might slowly blossom into something? boys aren't as complicated and if he is a dick about it then at least
@lmaocassandra well if you get rejected just think to yourself that you can't force someone to like you but he will defs keep an eye on u
@lmaocassandra him and now we can be ever closer friends because of it! we also make jokes about it and we like play flirt so it's nice haha
@lmaocassandra a relationship and he didn't want one either bc year 12 and our futures are so unclear and he said that he is so glad i told
@lmaocassandra and he is honestly such a nice guy so he handled it super well and we didn't end up as a couple because I wasn't looking for
@lmaocassandra it's because i was feeling shit and i didn't want to like him anymore and so i just told him to release all that feels
@deadpoetsneil they don't think like girls they aren't as complicated so I can assure you that they'll be super flattered
@deadpoetsneil they won't! because it's a massive compliment to them, boys have the biggest egos and they enjoy it trust me
@lmaocassandra but like halfway through this year i told a guy i liked him and it went super well and now we're like closer and it's nice
@lmaocassandra I told two guys I've liked them before and they both turnd out ok! 1 was in year 7 which was dumb idk if i count that one
@shiminlim IMPORTANT!! ALSO IT'S GOOD TO RELEASE ALL THAT BOTTLED UP FEELING BECAUSE ONCE HE KNOWS IT'S THE BIGGEST RELIEF EVER
@beingtottyx racist
Tell the guy you like him before it's too late because trust me I waited too long and now I'm stuck
@deadpoetsneil it like rejection but you just gotta deal with it and don't get your hopes up :-) it's more of a thing for you to release
@deadpoetsneil because it's a massive compliment for him and he will start thinking about you more and stuff idk there's OBVS down sides to
@deadpoetsneil well sometimes the guy I like(d) is a dick but you get to joke around about it and you honestly will become better friends
@deadpoetsneil do it, it was the first time I did it and it's such a relief because when he knows he is more considerate if that makes sense
@johnnifer_ the guy I've told has been really nice about it and we've become better and closer friends because of it so there's a plus!
@johnnifer_ I think all boys would react well because they would be super flattered and they'll keep thinking about it aka thinking about u
$200 for a cake? Man I'm too poor for this
@johnnifer_ that's so good! I wish I told more boys I liked them in high school haha it's such a relief
@suggletzalfie @velvetgh0st what's her snapchat?
What is gabby's snapchat?
My neighbours are fighting great
Why am I so dumb
@johnnifer_ he's a keeper has he acted diff since u told him?
Typical me lol damn it I gave in
People tell you to love your body but when you do you're seen as vain and over-confident you can never win
@johnnifer_ who's the boy that u like is it the one from work or the 1 U smooched I can't keep up with u n ur boys
@nicoIamurphy I can't date a boy who doesn't wear skinny jeans for reals
Yo I haven't studied these holidays fuck year 12
Queen of half selfies 
@notameIie yeah but the guy didn't have to be such a dick about it ya feel oh well
Giving u a piece of my mind ha
“@nicoIamurphy: Son 
@kristyleaa you are so pretty
@Tessaasimpson aren't u glad Eleanor and I made u do it bc I am #proud
@notameIie but the comments made were insulting and basically bullying I think they should pay for 2 seats but fat shaming the guy was wrong
Apparently clubbing in Australia sucks compared to Singapore God damn it
Goodnight

@Truman_Black how does worrying about Ebola make people stupid?
But it's also horrible to presume that she is not mentally stable so idk you can't ever win and please everyone
Just sad seeing people make fun of her because it's never nice to be made fun of especially if you're in her situation, absolutely horrible
Anyway I hope Amanda Bynes gets some help, because you can tell by her tweets that she's not fully stable, and I honestly do wish her well
Now I'm getting butt hurt over people getting butt hurt what has the Internet turned me into. A hypocrite.
Ps it wasn't leaked universal music in France screwed up and released it early there's a difference
@amandabynes I really hope you're ok and that you seek help whether or not you suffer from something or if your father did abuse you
Stop being sensitive and get over it honestly there are children dying and you're upset over a video being leaked. Wow.
People who say shit like "you're not a true fan if you watched the leaked version" need to grow the fuck up and stop being pussies
Why do people get so butt hurt over the video being leaked get over yourselves you'll still watch it when it gets released anyway
That one time I went as Minnie Mouse for Halloween
