You selfish prick.
Have written for a few weeks. So it's time to get back on it.
Fuck you @Walmart employee. Sorry if you hate your life and your job but I feel you could have done something about it.
If you can't sell them don't even have them in your fucking store @Walmart. That's such fucking bullshit. @Walmart @Walmart
But I'm sorry you don't put out a whole display of something then when it doesn't ring up simply say"it's not in the system can't sell them"
So @Walmart is that your stupid fucking rule or was that lady to lazy to look up a price?
Can I go back to bed now?
I've probably drank at least 3 gallons of water today.
Fuck this day...
Fuck this headache... <WEARY FACE><PISTOL>
This month can be over now.
I think I'm getting sick and it fucking sucks...
If we were friends in high school this song pertains to you.
Looking back at everything thinking who the fuck were we.
9:30 on a Saturday? Goodnight!
@terkzz you're welcome!!!
@terkzz good luck!!!
Nothing like feeling invisible when out to dinner with your family...
Comes close to the worst...
Can I just go to bed...?
Sorry I fuck everything up.
No, we don’t mind waiting
No we don’t mind. 
looking for a miracle.
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin with you
I'm gonna 24 tomorrow. So fuck off.
I'm just a bitter human being. Deal with it.
I'm empty is as empty gets.
But basically it's two days before my birthday and I don't give a shit about anything.
Cause I'm a failure at everything so I might as well admit it.
Just fuck off.
And you two are best buds and fuck off.
I'm just different than everyone in my family.
I woke up today hating everything. It's nice to see nothing has changed.
I keep building walls but you’re always on my mind.
I'm writin you a song. Hopefully you like it.
I'm just tired of feeling like shit and tired of feeling sick.
Can my birthday not be next week? Just another thing to weigh me down... <PENSIVE FACE><WEARY FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
Man, I feel like Drake but with less money and sleeping on hotel floors.
Started writing a song on the hotel room floor. And just built it up from there. Is that what it means to start from the bottom now we here.
I'm ready for bed. But let's have a conversation.
One night down. One night to go.
@OriginalFunko I think you should make @CommunityTV pop figures. It's the show that never dies with a very large following.
Better.
Man, fuck snakes in my yard.
Wait.
 
1. Follow @CommunityTV
2. Retweet this.

Rules: 
If you have to ask, you're streets behind.
And I got the point that I should leave you alone.
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
And this'll be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you
And I can't speak
Someone read this speech and tell me it sucks so I feel better about it.
@FunkoPOPvinyl probably my Robb Stark from Game of Thrones. #myfavoritepop
And congratulations after saying you weren't going to hand him a blank check and then do that exact thing.
Fuck this.
I'm done with all of this shit. Cause I have done so much just to please everyone and now you go behind my back and screw me over.
I am so fucking done with all of this shit.
All the shit I do for you and to help you and you pull something like that. Are you fucking kidding me.
You don't even understand how pissed I am. Or how shitty that is.
Goodbye Twitter! Until tomorrow!
I caught Drogon once. He was a little smaller than I remember. #CatchDrogon @GameOfThrones 
we all die alone
but my heart could be your home
Ordered another direwolf pup plush for @GameOfThrones tomorrow!
@curl_becky you're welcome!!!!
@curl_becky that was amazing!
Doing something unspeakable.
Friends to the north...Stay safe!
But on the plus I just came up with the title to my mixtape. Even though no one cares.
I'm so fucking sore and tired. Fuck, bury me in my bed.
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@LindsyxDanielle good luck with your test!
Remember when I was king? #FuckMemoryLane
4 days!!!
I slept so shitty last night.
And that's the exact reason I'm not waiting.
This song might be the death of me.
I'm not stressed over this shit just annoyed. Very annoyed.
It's gonna bug the fuck out of me if I can't find this fucking quote.
This all just needs to be over.
I can't wait till I get to miss holidays cause I won't be living in the same state.
Yes I am pissed.
I will no longer consider you part of my family. So be a better mom cause you aren't.
I work hard for what I have and I don't like stupid shit happening to it when it can easily be avoided.
They got 2 perfectly big yards to play with that shit don't let them run around crazy and not even say a word.
It never should have happened. And it's  inconsiderate. And watch your fucking kids. And don't give them fucking silly string and turn cheek
Someone write these speech for me so I don't have to. Please?
Yeah, well, tell one of your other kids cause I don't know what to do anymore.
Days get worse emotions get worse.
Man I'm still just trying to see the new Cinderella movie. #KingoftheNorth
@muhleeen have a safe flight!
If I run away tonight will you follow me?
I am so fucking glad I'm off tomorrow.
I'm ready for today to be over.
Tired. Sick of everyone and everything. You pick.
Plus I'm busy every weekend from now until I'm done recording.
That bitch is younger than me. Why the fuck would I want to go to her wedding. Not to mention we don't fucking talk.
Gonna start mapping out my first song tonight. #StreetsAhead
And yes that's exactly how I feel about it.
Cause between me and my brothers they can do no wrong. Sorry I have dreams.
Or.... This!?!?!? 
Do I want this and this.... 
Or no one help.
I'm at a crossroad. I don't know what to buy... Someone help!
I'd very much like to be home now.
Goodnight moon. Tomorrow I'll be home in my own bed.
Lookin for a friend a million miles from home.
Someone please text me.
I wish I had more/better friends.
I can't sleep in these hotel beds. Leave me sweet nothings to read in the a.m.
Maybe I'm late to the party or my music taste changed or maybe I don't give a fuck but I have so many Big Time Rush songs stuck in my head.
Can I be asleep now?
Pulled up to the hotel and they were playing @charli_xcx that's a good sign.
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide.
"This is just a small part of your total life history."
I've got writers block. Real bad.
Never get married.
You had all winter to do this but you bring it the Wednesday before. The boat is a major piece of shit.
You're going on your honeymoon on Friday. Going to Miami. Then driving this boat to the key west.
You know how bad my days been by the percent left of battery I have. It's currently at 44%.
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pick pockets
Can I start recording the vocals for my mixtape yet?
This is what it's like to feel completely empty.
Can I start fresh in a new town.
"So you don't know the real me. 
More like the mirror me."
"I'm the only one that understands me. 
Cause when I talk my demons are always listenin."
Can I just runaway?
Just sigh...
Now what do I do with my life...
Well that dream was fucked up.
But no friends.
This is one of those "I need someone to vent to" moments. <PENSIVE FACE>
Someone should text me...
Maybe instead of getting drunk and judging my life you should pay a little more attention to your fucking kids.
What makes you so much better than me because you eat meat and I don't? Really? What's so fucking great about it?
So what if I'm a vegetarian. The fuck does it matter to you? Is it hurting you? Get over it. Does it offend you? Grow the fuck up.
I won't apologize for shit. And I won't let people walk over me. I don't back down.
Dude seriously fuck people like that. I'm so fucking sick of this fucking world and ignorant ass fucks like that.
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill.
I wanna be on a #CatchTheThrone mixtape. Since most of my songs touch on @GameOfThrones anyways.
It's all just another day. And yes I am sick... =\
Maybe I'm just pissed at the world for the way it rotates.
That everything should be handed to you? FUCK THAT. You work for it. And never stop.
But the people in it. And just how they act and how they are and they don't see the big picture in the world.
I fear the future. And not cause I don't know how my life will pan out or anything like that.
I'm really not in the fucking mood for this shit.
Everyone reads shit on the internet but you're one of the only people I know that listens to all the fucking bullshit they say.
Follow the movement. Follow the dream.
Honestly it's a shame it's been months on top of years and nothing. Now what are you waiting for?
I'm back to my "I can do this on my own" attitude cause I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you.
I think I'm getting sick...
All of these great ideas come at work. Where I can't work on them. Cause I'm supposed to be working.
Here we go again. Swimming with the sharks again.
I can't handle #MTVEyeCandy anymore. It's too much! But so addicting!
Cause that pisses me the fuck off...
So now I strive in everything I do to prove him wrong. To prove the world wrong.
Like that time 4 or 5 years ago when my dad said I had to figure out what I want to do in life cause I won't make it in music.
I've been walked on for what seems like forever. And I'm done with it.
I have a lot of anger and a lot of passion. And I put it into everything I do.
I don't add family on Facebook. My family should understand that.
Never Grow Up. 
That's cool I guess.
I feel like shit. <WEARY FACE>
I just want to know how you ended up in my dreams.
Goodnight moon.
I have more dreams when I'm awake than when I'm sleeping.
Someone come to New Lenox and bring me lunch.
Can't I just make money for liking Community and Game of Thrones. Get pay checks just for watching them. Is there a job for that?
But none of you care about that.
Found 2 beats today but there's still 100s to go through.
Which is just a big fucking waste of my fucking time.
Maybe I'm just bitter cause in the middle of winter I have to in to work when there's no work cause you have to babysit you're fucking gf.
These awards takin too long.
Tomorrow starts the long haul of endless searching for free beats on the inter web. Wish me luck. #StreetsAhead #NinetyOneBrand
Someone text me.
You get stepped on then you get rolled over.
It's 5:30. Can I go to bed?
Throw in Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
And Tuesday.
And tomorrow.
Fuck today.
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me.
You can tell my moods off from the type of music I've been listening to lately.
I should be fucking sleeping.
Such is life. 
Snow.
Then when you're done you read it back to yourself and then delete it? Cause I do.
Do you ever write something down just to get it off your chest? Knowing no one will ever see it.
Goodnight moon.
Someone text me.
Just flipping through 1070 songs on my iPod trying to find the right emotion.
I don't mind having my back against the wall. But sometimes it gets hard to breathe.
I'm not having a bad day. More like a bad week. A bad month.
I need new friends. Except for like 2 people.
I'm so sick of this shit.
I'm sick of this feeling.
One day something might go right.
I just want to do something great.
If there's off days and on days, today is a fuck off day.
From bad to worse.
I'll be miserable at best.
Bought this sweet ass hoodie today. And Lilo &amp; Stitch on dvd. But that hoodie man damn.
Goodnight moon.
Can't lie. Today sucked.
So now I just sit at home alone all day.
Ready to go back to bed.
@SaraUnderwood I'm not up late I just wake up this early.
I'm on this other other shit.
I'm ready for this day to be over.
My shoulders hurt. My elbows hurt. My ankles hurt. I need to get away and be able to relax.
@LindsyxDanielle don't feel bad! I go through that all the time!
I'm gonna find my valentine at the bottom of a bottle.
What some people don't know is, this time last year I was in a dark place. And I'm just now starting to climb out.
Let me shut my mind off.
Can I just sleep the next 3 days?
It's just weird to think you were always there when I needed someone to talk to and now we don't even exist to one another.
This world is a scary place. And our minds and thoughts are a scary place.
2014 first time I seen a live free throw. 
Chicago where we seen 2*Sweets final show.
@LindsyxDanielle Ok. <BLUE HEART>
@LindsyxDanielle everything ok?
Just got home from GOT. Best night I had in a long time.
On a separate note Game of Thrones IMAX in a few hours!
Lower class problems.
It's the first place to feel like home. And now it might not be. So now what?
I don't want to have to move from here...
Game of Thrones IMAX tonight! Whoop! @GameOfThrones
I'm gonna do this on my own. So when I move away I'll be on my own. They can call me up and I'll be gone. Cause I'm not waiting anymore.
Go from working on boats to working on cars. Such is life just to get people around this world.
Knockin out these songs one by one.
Smashed my finger today and it still fucking hurts. <WEARY FACE>
It's a Monday in January. Why do I need to be here? You could be closed and no one would know the difference.
I'm not friendly. How do I have friends?
It's 6:06 and this week needs to be over.
Fuck today.
Nothing makes me more nervous than working on my moms car.
Goodnight world.
Fuck em if they can't take a joke.
And it kinda pisses me off.
Still the most I've ever had to spend on clothes I don't get to keep.
Some fucking people. I find it fucking disgusting that we ever called you friends.
=\
Man fuck @comcast how do you always have major problems. And it won't be fixed till 1 in the morning?
Goodnight moon.
I'm a mess, such a wreck, don’t forget about it.
Writing a biography in the form of rap songs.
Just deleted like half the people on my friends list on Facebook cause why not?
Sorry I wanted Green Bay to win cause they deserved it more.
I just felt like I was dying.
We live we die.
Like what's the fucking point to any of it when you really think about it.
It doesn't matter if it was my fault or their fault the fact is its over. Years or so of my life and some person just gone.
It's amazing the people I used to talk to and be friends with and now they're gone.
But really I need somewhere to live.
This is such fucking bullshit.
I'm ready to move to California. Who's coming with?
The plus to being at work by yourself is you can watch @donaldglover videos.
Someone text me?
@paugasol how are you doing with Chicago's winter? #AskPau
Maybe one day I'll wake up happy. That'll be the same time I have my own house in Cali.
I'm ready to go back to bed.
I'm broke and you can't fix it.
And no one knows what goes on in my head. And I keep it that way. I'm broken we know this. It needs to be quiet like silent bliss.
Maybe I am bitter as fuck at 23. Maybe I don't give a fuck. Maybe I don't like big crowds cause none of them know what life's really about.
Current mood for the day: =/
=\
Sigh...
Don't worry. I made it home through the blowing snow.
Those moments you wish you could send out a blank tweet cause you're at a loss of words and want everyone to know.
Fuck I miss @GoRadio
Goodnight moon.
I'm sick of this world again..
Early morning song writing.
Rewatching the first season of #Community because #sixseasonsandamovie

The flag shouldn't have been picked up. Here's why: 



Get HYPED: 
Wish I could go to the @Panthers game today.
I stayed up late last night. In 2015 it's the first thing I regret.
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back.
I'm fucking bored...
@taylorjayne_92 love that song!
I feel broken.
Someone chat with me.
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety.
@terkzz happy new year Ellie!
Happy 2015 everyone.
When I make it to the fucking top the ladder will be burned before you make it up the first step.
I'm just bored...
@Nate13Burleson it's conspiracy. The NFL doesn't want the lions in the super bowl. The ratings would be better with the Seahawks or Packers
When you want to talk to someone at 11:50 but you know no one is up.
You know. Just watching Frozen on my laptop. 

#TogetherWeHunt 
Someone text me. 7084760288
#ProtectHome #SeeRed
Going to the @chicagobulls game tonight!
I kinda want McDonald's breakfast.
Too tired to sleep.
Way too fucking bored...
I'm bored. Someone talk to me.

Sometimes my room looks like a Walgreens.
Can't sleep...
If it was just you and me, this world could end tomorrow.
Every time I cough it's like "cough DEATH cough" "cough KILL ME cough"
I guess I should get back to work. Text me and keep me company.
My legs still feel like jelly.
Someone text me.
Waiting for this NyQuil to kick in.
Someone come take care of me. Please and thank you.
Feeling so fucking shitty.
Sick the week before Christmas. Welcome to my life.
It doesn't feel like Christmas is coming up. Maybe it's just me but it feels like its still months away.
I'm so bored. And don't want to work tomorrow.
My hit list has more names than a thank you speech
Can we just skip over Christmas now?
I'm done with family. Can I move yet?
Can't sleep. Someone chat with me.
I feel so out of place everywhere.
I just hope we don't have to move...
I'm just over everything.
Sitting here like what the fuck do I want for Christmas...

I hope that necklace chokes you like a noose.
That years from now I'll loom back on everything I did and be proud. If I have kids, I raise them to be respectful.
It's always live fast die young. Or you only live once. But I want to die proud.
The worlds a dark terrifying place. And if just for a second I can show someone they're not alone maybe it'll be worth it.
Don't try to bring summer quicker cause you're not a winter kid.
Can today be over?
After 2 nights of next to no sleep and weird ass dreams... I can't keep doing this.
Things just aren't looking up...
Merry Christmas. I could care less.
So can I move away now?
I'm already over all of this.
Bought an iron throne ornament today. I will rule the seven kingdoms of Christmas.
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome! =) and thank you. =)
@LindsyxDanielle have good day!
Goodnight moon.
Successful Black Friday shopping on Friday.
Left over tofurkey roast to end the night.
Don't worry world. I made it home.
On that note. Here's a Christmas tree. 
Take this however you want. Yes there are a lot of cute girls in Chicago and Illinois but there are way cuter ones in Detroit and Michigan.
We're in Indiana. Almost home. #IllBeHomeForChristmas
@LindsyxDanielle have fun!
Driving home in a snow storm. Hope we don't die...
Today I was in the same building as Tim Allen and @BigSean so I'm thankful for that. And a @Lions victory.
I'm not saying that was the worst night sleep I ever got. But I'm gonna need a lot of monster to wake me up. Let's get that shit pouring.
@Springleigh You too!
Can't fucking sleep...

#DefendTheDen 
@BigSean are you gonna be at the @Lions game tomorrow?
Just hanging in the hotel. #MadeItToTheD
Leaving for Detroit tomorrow at 7! #CountdownToDTown
Just need to get tomorrow over with.
I remember when I would get christmas cards. When I had friends.
2 days! #CountdownToDTown
3 days! #CountdownToDTown
I'm just ready for a fucking break...
Still on those weird as fuck dreams... <PENSIVE FACE>
So I have to pay $200 for clothes I don't get to keep?
Cause who gives a fuck if you think I'm a dick.
Chalk that up on reasons I'll never get married.
5 days! #CountdownToDTown
@TheAnnaFaith HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
6 days! #CountdownToDTown
One week! #CountdownToDTown
I'm not the kid I used to be. But I wish I had friends like I used to.
@terkzz it will!
@terkzz yea. =\ I think it's taking its toll on a lot of people already. =( But it'll get better!
Someone tell me about the day they had.
Can I go back to bed?
@terkzz you're welcome. If you ever want to talk I'm here. And I've been meh.
I hate being awake so I sleep. I hate sleeping so I stay awake.
@terkzz you aren't.
So many people I went to high school with are getting married and having kids and I'm just like, "what the fuck should I buy on iTunes?"
Yes I'm a hateful person. Yes I'm an asshole. But you know what. So?
So why did I have to come to work today?
And I don't care about drag racing so leave me alone about it. Fuck.
I'm just fucking sick of you talking to me and being here. I just want to go home. Cause this place won't ever be home...
I'm over this week already. Can it be Saturday?
Can I go home now?
That had to be a NyQuil induced dream...
@TheAnnaFaith the only place to go is up. It can only get better from here. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Someone text me and be my friend. But don't cause my phones gonna die.
Why would anyone want to get to know me? I don't even want to know me.
I'm so sick of this shit.
2weeks! #CountdownToDTown
So we moved our separate ways it's for the best.
Some of the best sleep but worst dreams. Now I want breakfast.
Goodnight moon.
Fuck this. Back to my shitty moods.
Yes I'm wearing pink socks today. Cause yes I'm that cool.
23 days. #CountdownToDTown
Going to bed early is what the cool kids do.
In bed at 8:30 on a Saturday. The dream is real.
Lookin outside like "winter is coming."
Oh fuck it's halloween. Happy Halloween! <GHOST>
Cause... Is it Friday yet?
Not feeling at all better. I should have stayed in bed.
It's hard to believe that halloween is this Friday.
Takin these nighttime meds like I've got drug induced dreams.
I'm just ready for bed. Still feeling like shit.
You might be proud but you're no lion.
I love Halloween but once again I'm not looking forward to it. <PENSIVE FACE><GHOST><JACK-O-LANTERN>
Have you ever noticed. 
That maybe I don't know this. 
I talk in different voices. 
Like I don't make my own choices.
This is why I don't rely on anyone but myself. For anything. Cause I'm the end fuck everyone.
What friends?
My bones crack when I stand up. Is that a problem?
Someone come make me feel better...
These meds are starting to kick in.
Worst time to get sick...
Goodnight you and goodnight moon.
I just want some soup.
I'm sick of all of this.
I think I'm getting sick. So that'll be fun for the next few days.
I push people away like I'm closing doors. My mind can't handle mental chores.
I'm done.
Another 40 hours this week.
Someone should text me...
Don't worry world I've been up since 4.
But at least I'll be doing something.
I'm sorry this isn't just bar talk for me. I'm not trying to spend the rest of my life in Illinois.
Workin 40+ hours this week. I'm not makin bank. I am the bank.
All I do is work and sleep. And write.
Someone should chat with me.
Luckily tomorrow is Friday.
Maybe tonight I'll get drunk and tell you how I really feel.
I'm gonna try this on my own. And if I fail then so be it. But at least I tried. I can't wait for everyone else.
Nothing good is going to come from today.
I don't fuck with you.
But dues are never paid until you're six feet under.
That some nights we stay till 7:30-8 just to finish. And wake up at 5 the next day just to do it again.
"He lives with his parents he's probably handed everything." And yes I work for my dad but that doesn't mean I don't work 40 hours a week.
I've lost plenty of free time. I've lost friends and times with them. I feel as though people look at what I have and say.
I worked. Sometimes 1 job sometimes 2 jobs. Sometimes 3 jobs. Until I was so sore I couldn't walk. My ankle had to be wrapped cause of it.
I'm not lucky for the things I have in my life. All the electronics and clothes I have. Weren't handed to me. I didn't win any contests.
What friends.
Kinda want to send a book to @MartysaurusRex #martysbookclub
I'm pretty sure you owe me $1000. And should probably pay me before you buy your gf a fridge or go on vacation.
So long and goodnight.
I'm done with the world today. I'll try again in a few weeks.
Cause it never feels ok..
Or give a shit. I shouldn't say that but it's how I feel. Maybe I'm just that depressed. And once in awhile need someone to say it's ok.
Maybe looking at these four walls start to get to me. Maybe my mind isn't what it used to be. Like even my friends wouldn't get it.
I wish I had more people to talk to in the morning.
After drunk singing The Wonder Years and 2*Sweet I think I might be ok. At least until I wake up tomorrow.
So he gets to go to Japan. And you get a vacation. And I get to work... Seems fair..
Man your battle stations.
Don't really want to sleep tonight. But that's just my mood.
Bitch I got no feelings to go. I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go.
Another band breaking up... Didn't see that coming... =/
I've been saying goodbye for years. You just haven't been listening.
"Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino. 
Saw I was rich, now they fuckin' with 'Bino."
But I love you more than words can say
I can't count the reasons I should stay
Someone chat with me.
Fuck everything right now.
Why?
I'll just fade away with the rest of the past.
I can't seem to shake this awful feeling.
Halloween raps so you know I'm white.
How is it only Tuesday...
Not to mention you're taking my Saturday from me. Fuck all of this.
Fuck all of this.
And then there were 0.
I'm just laying here fearing any human contact with anyone.
Leaving Facebook for the month.
"I'm hoping when I'm gone, you'll remember me."
I'm over this.
And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with.
But what music can I listen to if I can't describe my mood. They don't make lost empty music.
Music describes your mood right? So if you angry it's angry music. Sad, sad music. Happy, happy music. And so on.
I can't say what's wrong with me cause I don't know how to put in to words that I just feel completely empty...
Someone text me.
Goodnight.
Just trying to talk to someone as I watch movies.
Cause I've buried the past six feet under. Maybe it's the weather. But I think I'm getting better.
Nothing like deleting songs just to start fresh. Take shots at the title belt instead of the past.
I could spend a million. Double dog dare me.
...Sometimes I just need someone to talk to.
Happy October.
@terkzz if you ever want to talk I'm here.
Dear world. My joints hurt.
 Love, Tinkle-Town. RT @YNB: Thanks for the years of laughs &amp; l…
Fuck this.
"but then my words get frozen
  in my mouth like Eskimo's 

I like your nose."
I don't see the point in social media. Yet I have them. Does that make me a hypocrite?
The first day I get to sleep in and I'm wide awake at 6.
I really shouldn't listen to Fall Out Boy.
That was the most depressing dream I've ever had.
@OriginalFunko when do the new pops come out?
My legs are killing me. This winter will be harsh on these old bones.
Fuck this feeling though...
Just sigh... =|
I'm just gonna try to forget everything. Probably by drinking.
Just trying to find the good in the world.
Sitting here looking at these four walls.
@LindsyxDanielle agree.
@OriginalFunko Community!
I really hope my other sword ships from @SpiritHalloween soon. My other came yesterday.
Goodnight moon.
This week really needs to be over...
Can this week be over?
#100DaysToChristmas  <FATHER CHRISTMAS><CHRISTMAS TREE><WRAPPED PRESENT><SNOWFLAKE>️<SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW>️
I want to be back in bed. Not cause I'm tired. But cause I don't want to deal with the world.
Watched Frozen for the first time yesterday.
Yes I bought a Peter Pan hat today. Yes it says never grow up. Yes it's epic. Lol
I don't have memories. I just have a past.
I'm just blah...
That moment when you get to put your phone in your sweatshirt pocket and know hoodie weather is coming. The worlds an ok place.
Goodnight moon.
I don't even want to leave my bed for the rest of the night.
You need to chill the fuck out. Cause I've been fucking running ragged on all this bullshit and no one else has. And I'm at my wits end.
Man that guy was a dick. Like think of the biggest dick in the world and that guy topped it.
"The night is dark and full of terrors."
"and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth"
And just then it starts slipping through your finger tips.
And as happy as you can ever be.
I hope the world is everything you think it's gonna be.
Just another day in not paradise.
I'm really just tired as fuck.
If you're so fucking worried about all of it cancel your fucking trip and keep an eye on him. Fuck. Give us a little more credit than that.
And the only thing to piss me off was saying I might take a day off within the next 2 weeks. Sorry no. Not all of us can leave to Vegas.
And it looks like it'll be the same the next 2 weeks...
One weekend or year from now I'll finally be caught up on my sleep. Cause since Monday I've been running on E.
I really just want to sleep in my own bed with my stuffed tiger. That's all. Is that so much to ask for?
Finally in my own bed..
I'm just sitting here wishing it was 4 o'clock.
Just need to get through today.
Goodnight moon and goodnight you.
I'm so fucking done with this shit.
I'm just so drained and tired and stressed. This week needs to be over.
This is so fucking boring!
@ChicagoBears is there a giveaway this Sunday at the game for people walking in?
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome!
@LindsyxDanielle feel better!
Sometimes I just need a friend. Sometimes I just look in the wrong places.
"you look like Elisabeth Shue."
Maybe next time don't bring it on a short work week and want about $1000 job on it. Mother fucker.
I'm sorry dude. But my dads in the hospital, I really don't fucking care that you want to take your boat out Saturday.
Now I get to sleep in this creepy fucking house alone... Wonderful.
Almost 12 hours in the hospital...
Nothing like spending the whole day in the ER with your dad...
This whole week is gonna be bullshit.
Why today? Why this? Just why...
A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinion of a sheep.
My glow in the dark white walker is glowing just a little bit. And it's kinda fucking creepy.
Bought so much sweet shit today.
I keep to myself cause its easier that way.
I wanna sleep but there are nightmares when I try
I'm just lost. And my dreams make me more lost.
"I don't know, but maybe along the way you take my hand tell a few jokes and have some fun,"
Someone text me.
@curl_becky no you won't.
Fuck today too.
Robbed. That's all.
I need a nap and some booze. More booze than nap.
Fuck today.
Clearly @donaldglover should have won that award.
#TroyandAbed =( #sixseasonsandamovie 
And on another lonely night I'm just left here with my thoughts.
And that's how I live my life. Knowing that. Holding it over my head.
Pretty much I know deep down I'm disgrace to my parents. That's how I feel even if they said otherwise.
Maybe I shouldn't let work related things get to me but they always do.
I'm a fuck up I know. So I'm just gonna look for a new house with a new life so I can be a fuck up there.
This is the place where I used to call my home. Now it’s just a place I go.
Taking a break with Facebook cause I'm just sick of all the bull shit.
A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinion of a sheep.
All I wanna do is win in life. So fucking sue me for using cheat codes in this game.
When does @SpiritHalloween open though?
@terkzz but at least with a community college you can always try and transfer out of town.
@terkzz that's the same way I felt after I graduated. And that I should've gone to college.
There's times I hate the world and everything about it. And then there's times I just hate the world.
@LindsyxDanielle cause! =)
Who wants flowers when they're dead?
Just ordered the "Day of the Dead" Jack Skellington @FunkoPOPvinyl @OriginalFunko
It's gonna be a shitty day when your car won't start and it has to get towed.
Just got home. Goodnight moon.
Nothing like 14 hour days...
Listening to @donaldglover cause it's that kind of morning.
Goodnight moon and goodnight you.
I'm just overly tired. But I don't want to sleep. I just want to unwind.
We've got this long lost goodbye. 
Then it's time for us to die. 
But what I wanted to tell you. 
There's room in this coffin for two.
Such random dreams...
I'm ready to take my chances in California.
Just another week in hell.
Another weekend home alone.
I've been a pretty crappy friend lately.
I'm so glad I come home on the weekends just for you to leave... When can I have a puppy?
@Lions when do your single game tickets go on sale?
I just need like 3 days of sleep but I wouldn't make it past 6 hours.
In bed at 8 on a Friday. That's my life.
Just writing songs that will never be heard.
Fuck this.
@LindsyxDanielle =/
It feels like heaven to finally lay down and be off my feet.
@LindsyxDanielle I spent all of today outside.
I'm not even tired I just feel like shit.
Shot of fireworks last night for like the first time. Don't worry I still have 10 fingers.
Sure as fuck can't sleep... =/
I could never have kids. Like fuck.
Such weird fucking dreams.
Pop pop!
Not that I'm superstitious or anything but my fortune from my fortune cooking yesterday hasn't come true yet.
And just like that community's back! #sixseasonsandamovie
@WhatsUp_Jo you have a great body.
I can do without both of you. Believe me on that one.
Just an all around shitty day and shitty mood.
Man fuck this.
I wish I had more people to talk to. But I'm just awkward and anti-social.
@_thugsbunny_ you said nudity is art. You can make all the art you want. Besides you don't need talent to make art. It can be anything.
@OriginalFunko when do the new Game of Thrones pop figures come out?
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome. =)
@LindsyxDanielle you always look beautiful.
Fuck this.
We're not giving up. We're just giving in.
I'm mentally lost at 23...
Goodnight moon.
I'm ready to go to bed.
In bed at 9:30 on a Saturday. That's my life.
It's dreams like that, that I hate...
I feel like I haven't really talked to anyone in weeks. Like I'm just a ghost floating above the world. Waiting for another to notice me.
Dun dun dunnnnn.
Hopefully this isn't food poisoning...
You should've driven over the bridge before you burned it.
I'm pretty sure I don't need this shit. You're really starting to piss me off.
It's only May but this is a really shitty year.
@LindsyxDanielle aww how come? =\
@LindsyxDanielle lucky.
Just got home from Chicago.
Going to Chicago today...
@LindsyxDanielle sadly no...
Writing all these sad songs like people actually want to hear them.
I'm just gonna drink and eat cheez-its.
Goodnight moon.
Sitting at a desk listening to music on my phone trying to make sense of madness and boats.
There's a reason everyone in the family fucking hates you except your own fucking kids.
Because having a "family BBQ" over a service makes so much sense. Are you fucking kidding me?
Late night t-bell.
@LindsyxDanielle I know. Thank you.
@LindsyxDanielle goodnight! Thank you for everything the past few days.
@LindsyxDanielle thank you. =)
@dear_tragedy_ so good looking.
Maybe I just need a friendly face to talk to.
This picture though. 
This is just not a good day...
...
I'm just gonna lay here listening to the first season soundtrack. #Community #sixseasonsandamovie #SaveGreendale
Not to many people know this but #Community was there for me when I was completely alone...
I don't care how many followers I loose. I'm still gonna tweet about #Community  Cause my heart is broken over it.
Girls who like community &gt;&gt;&gt; #Community
But...
I don't normally do this.
We will always have #Community
That's fine @nbc I'll have more fun watching Thursday night football on CBS. #Community #sixseasonsandamovie #RenewCommunity
Why am I even here?
Can I just go back to bed?
I'll find a better way to spend my time.
It feels good just to lay in bed.
#sixseasonsandamovie
@NewEraCap are the NFL on field hats going to be the same this year or are they getting changed?
Tomorrows the worst day of the year.
To some people #community is just a tv show. To others like myself @nbccommunity is a way of life. #sixseasonsandamovie
My birthday is in 2 days...?
Goodnight twitter. It's been real. Thanks for always listening.
The fact of the matter is, you owe me money. It's simple.
So pardon me.
Maybe my mood sucks cause I buy a $40 DVD and you're in a bitch mood he buys a car and you're happy as can fuckin be.
I'm just gonna go to bed cause yea.
And if you surround yourself with all those people. Trust me I won't be one of them.
If you're waiting for me to build up your ego like everyone else, I won't. I give credit when credit is due.
This isn't a world I want to live in anymore...
In one week I turn 23... Yay?
#sixseasonsandamovie
Fuck this feeling...
This. @nbccommunity #Community #sixseasonsandamovie 
Are you always gonna have to borrow money from me?
I don't know what pisses me off more.
@LindsyxDanielle smile.
Someone text me. Please.
That's the most I've ever spent in target.
I'm ready for bed.
#ILoveCommunity because Troy and Abed in the morning!!! *nights*
And my mood flatlines.
Is this week over yet?
It seems everyday I come home in a bad mood. But I have to push it aside.
Today sucked.
I feel like I'm just gonna go to bed very soon.
Someone should text me...
Pretty sure I'm buying an iPad this weekend.
You need to check your fucking attitude.
All I can say is yes! @GameOfThrones #TakeTheThrone
There's just so much on my mind...
This morning kinda sucks... At least my mind does..
=\
I have so much to do today but I don't even want to get out of bed...
I had a dream I met @dannypudi. Woke up to find out I didn't. This is the darkest timeline. #Community #sixseasonsandamovie
So fucking pissed.
Where do you go when you just want to give up.
I'm just in such a shitty mood right now.
Sunday needs to come faster. #TakeTheThrone
@LindsyxDanielle I wanna see it when it's done!
I just feel really sick.
So glad @GameOfThrones is back on tonight! #TakeTheThrone #HouseStark
I can't believe @GameOfThrones season 4 starts tomorrow. And that I just finished season 3 a week ago. #TakeTheThrone #ValarMorghulis
Being up this early sucks when you have no one to talk to.
Don't worry world. I have a new celebrity crush.
I hate this feeling.
The HIMYM finale wasn't good.
I'm just tired of feeling like this...
Meh... =\
Bought 'May Death Never Stop You' cause I wanted to be able to buy a new MCR cd one last time.
I listen to @KillHannah when I sleep to make my dreams better.
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome. =)
@LindsyxDanielle I hope you're ok!
Goodnight moon.
Give me a reason to keep my head up.
Walk into the lions den just to get mauled by tigers. No wait I'm a liar. World goes to the highest buyer.
Fuck you dude. As simple as that. #RSVP
Someone text me...
Well that just put me in a really shit fucking mood.
I'm tired of feeling sick...
Someone should text me...
I'm glad you always pick the coldest fucking days to go and put signs up...
Fuck today.
Someone text me. Why? This is why. 
Perfect late night music is @DonaldGlover
It's the lonely nights that are the worst.
@cassandrasteele yes.
Someone should text me.
Sometimes I just want a friend sometimes I'm just looking for an answer that no one has a question for.
Everyone that calls themselves a nerd should watch @nbccommunity tonight. Nothing is better than them playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. #Community
Writing a song based on a tv show that isn't community. If you guess it right I'll tell you.
@alexanderdeleon let's write the summers number one hit and get one.
Goodnight moon.
Maybe there's more to me than this.
Anyways goodnight.
Got this paper cut from taking down my old @ddlovato poster to put up my new @ddlovato poster.
@EmilyOsment noooooo!
Someone should text me.
Girl from my dream, you better be real.
I just want to be in the same conversation as these other guys.
When @Sarah_Hyland posts things about #Community you know the world is a little better.
#IAMACommunityFan
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome! =)
@LindsyxDanielle good luck!
All I do is make the stuff I wanna write.
Reference things I wanna watch.
#TextbookOutlaws watch #Community tonight.
#TextbookOutlaws everyone loves an outlaw.
Lady shut the fuck up and go home! Damn!
I wanna go to Austin to see @DonaldGlover
My shovel broke...
I feel really sick...
@dannypudi the center slice of a square cheese pizza?
I'm just sittin here like I'm really bored. And falling asleep.
Someone should text me.
@MartysaurusRex talkin about the shoe lace guy?

Cause what's the point in trying to be happy.
Drink after drink until I fall asleep.
@LindsyxDanielle welcome to my world...
I might as well start drinking now.
All I want to do on Thursday is watch #Community and then my dad changes the channel... #MeowMeowBeenz
#MeowMeowBeenz is gonna be a way of life. Wait it is life.
#MeowMeowBeenz baller!
#MeowMeowBeenz community tonight. watch it!
Today sucks. That's all.
I wish today was Friday. I wish I didn't have to work today. I wish I was still in bed.
Cause digging into the ground will work when it's this cold... 
Let me dig my own grave.
#WatchCommunityThursdayOnNBC cause rolling a one will never be the same. #sixseasonsandamovie #Community #WatchCommunityThursdayOnNBC
Cause I love wasting my time on "wells" and "what ifs"
Maybe I need a better outlook on life. Maybe my life needs to be better so I can have a better outlook on it.
Yes. Because I want to be outside working in this.
I really don't want to do anything today. Or this week.
I want a house and tv show like Mac Miller but I want the fame and exposure like Macklemore.
And all I can think of is who wants to listen to another white rapper.
This cold has given me no motivation for anything.
My brain, my mind, everything is just drained.
I have 13 songs.
When you can't say anything depressing cause depressing just doesn't cover it.
It's like when your mood is already headed downward then it runs into a brick wall.
I don't want to go to sleep tonight because I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
@petewentz bloodhound gang.
I don't care about the oscars cause I haven't seen any of the movies. Cause I'm not about that life and I'm glad for that.
I guess I could go to sleep. Since all the songs are finished. And I don't think I'll start any new ones anytime soon.
Yay! Go, Jeff Winger’s study group! Those guys are ballers, yo. I hope you like getting balled. #Community #sixseasonsandamovie
For real?
I'm just running circles around in my head. Each lap is just as lonely as the one before it.
I'm an asshole but you really are a terrible person. And I really mean that. Prove me wrong.
Everyone watch @communitynbc tonight! It's the greatest show ever. #AbedsLesson #sixseasonsandamovie
If I wanted your 2 cents, I'd rob you.
I'm done trying.
Finishing one song after another.
I want famous friends. But I want my friends to be famous.
Someone should text me. Talk to me about the world or the clouds or the cold.
@terkzz I know how you feel. If you need to talk I'm here.
Marry me. Please. 
Storms here.
I write majority of my songs about movies, tv shows, and real life. It's up to you the listener to figure out what's what.
Remember when we used to be friends. But that's the past. We can't go back there.
I'm gonna build a bridge just so I can burn it.
Someone text me.
And if you could talk to me, tell me if it's so. That all the good girls go to heaven. Well, heaven knows.
Just starting a Nerf war. Nothing important.
@ClandestineHan hmmm doesn't seem fair then. I won't fight you.
@ClandestineHan is this fight till the death?
@ClandestineHan knives guns or mind control?
Goodnight moon.
Either way I've dropped some pretty big bombs on parts of my life in these songs.
Cause if you don't hate it, you'll hate me. If you don't hate me. You'll love it.
Here's to hoping you never actually listen to my music.
I just feel like shit. There's to much going on in my mind.
I just want sleep. But eh.
@ClandestineHan I'm still here. In a snow storm.
@ClandestineHan cheerios up!
I'm gonna finish writing this mixtape today and finally be proud of something.
When weeks turn into months I'm walking away.
But whatever you do. Don't roll a one. Cause we're all evil. I am the villain.
And if you don't care about my life or my music. Listen to it for the beats Kyle will be making. Cause it's as much his project as mine.
But don't listen it cause we're friends or whatever. Listen to it so you can know what's going on in my life.
And if you don't want to listen to it. I really don't want to give a fuck.
And no it's not all lovely and nice for your parents to listen to. It pulls on every string you could imagine.
And there's 2 reasons my mixtape is goin to be called The Darkest Timeline.
The reason I'm jumping into this music is I'm tired of people saying my words. I want the world to know what I have to say.
You can call it bitter or childish, I call it life. So either join in or get rolled over.
Don't worry. You know I'm takin shots at everyone.
I just want a house in California.
You say it's all about love. I say it's all about getting drunk.
@MelanieIglesias #BeMineMelanie please? =)
@muhleeen don't die!
@cserratos will you be my valentine?
Someone should text me. 708-476-0288.
@dear_tragedy_ so sexy. I miss seeing the booty.
Bought a nerf gun. Now it's war.
Who wants to be my valentine? I always seem to wait till the last minute.
I feel like I'm wasting time when I try to talk to some people.
@Our_Greendale Paige.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Keep your two cents. You need it more than I do.
Haven't you figured it out yet? Every story needs a villain. I'm yours.
Can I just hide the rest of my life?
I'll never get used to hospitals...
Every night I'll post "someone text me" and no one ever does. Maybe one day someone will. A guy can dream right?
@terkzz love that song.
paint me as a villain.
I just want to sleep...cause... Fuck this.
Someone should text me...
Feeling all depressed and shit.
I'm just trying to get breakfast.
I am Brutalitops, the magician! #Community #sixseasonsandamovie
In my life. Cause that would be great.
I need someone that can make videos, someone that can make/design clothes, someone that takes pictures, and someone that loves community.
Sadly I didn't win 1.5 mil last night... =/
#Community
When Jeff and Abed get drunk to drunk dial Britta. #BreakfastClub #Community
@LindsyxDanielle exactly. But from what I hear using data with iMessage doesn't use hardly any data. And I'll remember to leave my wifi on.
@LindsyxDanielle but that's all I know. =/
@LindsyxDanielle and if you send it as an iMessage you can touch the message and a little thing comes up that says send as text.
@LindsyxDanielle I don't know. I know it sends as a text when you're off everything.
Forgot @LindsyxDanielle has an iPhone and didn't get her text till this morning cause my internet wasn't turned on.
The time I could use a best friend. I go to bed. Cause I don't have friends.
Such is my luck.
@dear_tragedy_ you're welcome. =)
Almost noon. Steger still hasn't plowed the streets.
@dear_tragedy_ so cute!!
Every towns like "we're gonna wait for the snow to stop before we plow" cause the world can wait go your lazy ass to start working.
Leave it to Steger to drop the ball again. I should get paid if I have to shovel my fucking street.
"Holy crap Leonard's a zombie!" "ZOMBIE ATTACK! #TroyAndAbed #sixseasonsandamovie
I might not win. But still. #EsuranceSave30

All of my tweets have been #EsuranceSave30 and I don't care who I piss off.
Someone text me. 708-476-0288.

Hell yea Seattle! #EsuranceSave30
#EsuranceSave30
Best commercial. #EsuranceSave30
But for real guys. Remember that shit. Cause I hardly do.
Now it's I'm just gonna watch Community on repeat for 5 hours go to sleep wake up and do it again.
All my friends would be like "what are you doing Friday"? And I'd be like going to see that kidnap show.
Remember when Kidnap was a thing?
You're actin like a fucking baby. It's embarrassing.
When I get famous I want a clothing line. But I want someone else to run and part own it. So I can spread the wealth.
Goes to bed at midnight. Wakes up at 6.
Goodnight world.
@terkzz that's just being human. You can't always block the negative stuff. You just have to know how to fight through it.
@terkzz you're welcome. And let em talk. You're doing better than they are. That's why they do it.
@terkzz plus you have a job pre college. And I respect you for that.
@terkzz but you're young. You still got plenty of time for fancy styles.
@terkzz go for it!
“@dannypudi: Woop Woop. @JoakimNoah #allstar #13ismyfavoritenumber #Iusedtohaveaponytail 
Man fuck the Olympics right now...
I'd rather run with 5ks.
Weird ass pointless dreams.
But really who calls me at 9:30?
@MartysaurusRex I'd buy that jersey.
Slowly weeding through people I don't talk to/don't talk to me.
House to myself tonight.
@terkzz yup. I had my brother burn me a copy of it. But even then up to a certain point on the cd it just gets bad.
@terkzz agree times 10.
This song is just so fucking bad.
Doing what I do best on a Saturday night. Watching Community. So keep me company? #sixseasonsandamovie
So cute!! 
Hold up wait a minute. All good just a week ago.
So that's 2014.
I just take it as we're not friends anymore.
Science in this bitch.
Who's gonna be rappin about the polar vortex? This guy.
Someone chat with me. I'm bored... 708-476-0288 or not. I'm used to my nights alone.
Watched Troys final episode of Community 3 times. Cried every time. @nbccommunity #DontGoTroy
I need friends...

I don't think people realize how sad that made me...
#BonTroyage #Community
#BonTroyage #Community
So sad!!! #BonTroyage @nbccommunity
I just.... No... =(
Now back to all tweets about community. I hear it's gonna be epic but so so sad.
But honestly don't even know what he did. Don't really care. That's all I heard though. Don't hate me.
EXCEPT when I drink and do drugs(if that's what he did) I would want to drag race a lambo too. But it's usually in GTA 5.
That being said I have nothing to say about Bieber.
I don't make jokes to piss people off(all of the time) sometimes I make them to lighten the mood.
@nbccommunity "You should be like Calvin. His best friend was a tiger, and he went on dope adventures..." #TroyMoment
Ordering this tomorrow. Cause Troy is leaving so it is the darkest timeline. @nbccommunity 
@muhleeen my day was pretty good. And yours?
@ClandestineHan cause that package seems legit!
Tomorrow's already Thursday... =/
@terkzz I hope it gets better. =)
@cserratos have a great day!!
Someone chat with me.
Naw it's cool... =\
Mashed tatoes!
I wish I had people to talk to...
Don't expect anything from me. Cause once you fall, I'll watch you keep crumbling.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I stopped feeling so long ago.
@ClandestineHan don't let em!
I can't find the reasons I should stay. One by one they all just fade away.
Next Thursday though... =\
Next weeks @nbccommunity is gonna be sad. I just have that feeling... #sixseasonsandamovie
I'm sad about tonight's episode of @nbccommunity. It ended way to quickly! #restinpierce #NeedsToBeNextThursday #coolcoolcoolcool =(
#RestInPierce
@sidsgraphs great pic!
@alisonbrie they're all good!
@LindsyxDanielle oh. I'm sorry. At least it went good though!
@LindsyxDanielle how did your interview go?
I hate when I have no one to talk to cause my mind just goes and doesn't come back...
It's bad when I spent 4 straight watching Community just cause its the only thing right now that makes me happy.
Maybe it's my fault. Right? Cause I didn't do this here or there. I just did enough. Never more. So now I'm making up for it.
Cause if you eventually crack its not long before you break.
Cause we all know I've been living in the shadows of everything else. Just watching the world move on as I watch like a shitty rerun.
Cause why should I try to keep my head up when it's easier to look down.
There's nothing I look down at more than myself.
At this point it's easier to move forward by myself. But if you want to come along for the ride you're more than welcome.
I should sleep. I guess...
I hate not knowing what's going on in my head.
@LindsyxDanielle you're welcome! =)
@LindsyxDanielle good luck!
Sometimes I need that friend that I don't feel like I have.
I hate when it's like this in my head...
Eventually I'll just stop talking to anyone.
Sometimes I just want to be a kid again. Cause there's so much I've missed out on.
I write all my best songs when I'm drunk. Saying that clearly I haven't written any good songs.
@terkzz you and me both.
I don't want to grasp reality right now so I'm still awake.
I'm ready just to give up and fall to pieces.
My mind is just a deep depressed black hole. That no one should ever see.
@muhleeen feel better!
@Sarah_Hyland watching it!!!
@DylanMitch1 no problem! And yea that's what people do now a days lol.
@DylanMitch1 that's not true man! Stay positive.
@DonaldGlover your new cd is one of the best I've heard in a long time.

@ClandestineHan I never said it's a bad thing! Lol. It just make you that more awesome!
@ClandestineHan good. Lol. =) you're the only person I know that sends another tweet to correct spelling. Lol.
@ClandestineHan the correct answer is what cheese.
@terkzz nothing. =/
@_kissmy_CASS_ I know how you feel.
@dear_tragedy_ nothin wrong with that. ;)
I'm just tired all the time.
We're gettin more snow tomorrow so there's that. Right?
I'm just trying to get the new @DonaldGlover cd.
Fuck you too bitch.
It feels like Saturday.

…
It's ok to be hurting.
Can I just like go away now?
@terkzz what's wrong? =(
Man I'm just tryin to put this Xmas tree up.
@terkzz damn... =(
If I never make it to Cali it's a life well wasted.
Getting a Christmas card from @ClandestineHan is always the highlight of my Christmas season. =)
@OfficialSanta all I want is a football.
I dreamed I had a pet lion last night. But it wasn't like a full grown lion. It was the size of a dog but still had the mane. Weird.
Following @OfficialSanta on twitter has been one of my better ideas.
The new @CITYLIGHTSBAND cd is so fucking good! Good job guys!
@_kissmy_CASS_ agree.
I wish I had Saturday night friends too.
This shit is fuckin Great! With a capital fuckin G!
I wish I had Friday night friends instead of listening to music in bed.
At this point I'd be better just getting drunk every night.
@terkzz mine too!
@terkzz that and just being pulled in multiple directions. =\
@terkzz me too.
Let me write a book called my 4 days with ups. And why you should never work for them or ship with them.
I mean is it really worth my life? Don't think so.
Why don't I just quit? Would be a lot easier for everyone. Mainly me.
It's a perfect world at least for today. Only 1 job.
In a perfect world I wouldn't have to work for ups today or tomorrow.
Someone just shoot me. Please and thank you.
I'm just gonna lay here. Dig my grave. I'll just role into it.
Just fuck everything right now. Fuck it. None of this is fucking worth it anymore. Complete fucking breakdown now. So just fuck it.
@_kissmy_CASS_ well I'm interested if someone drives.
@_kissmy_CASS_ how much and who's taking us?
@_kissmy_CASS_ yes. Lol.
@ClandestineHan we all know I didn't mean students! Lol. But thanks. =)
@ClandestineHan pass some my way.
You put it right. I am getting depressed and that's causing me to go crazy and drink so that's good.
I'm over this 3 jobs thing. The money isn't worth going crazy over. I just want to sleep.
@cserratos you can't stop tweeting!
@_kissmy_CASS_ did your mom tell you I got my copy?
There's just so much I wish I could forget.
I was just rotating my ankle and "pop" now it feels better.
@ClandestineHan cute!
That fuckin lady dropped my fuckin phone. I almost hit her.
@_kissmy_CASS_ thanks!!! =)
@_kissmy_CASS_ let me know how it is cause I'm gonna pick it up at target on Friday.
@dear_tragedy_ perfect!
When people need a sum of money like $100-$400 I want to just say here you go.
@ClandestineHan yay! =)
@ClandestineHan always!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What the hell is with the cat?
@BigBlack @irishvvolfhound we're all emojis of poop with big smiles? Sounds good to me.
@RonnieBrewerJr come back to Chicago. Please?
I've been up since 3 and just feel like shit. So don't take offense if I hand you a "fuck off" or "fuck you".
Can today be over so I can get through tomorrow.
Sitting at home watching space jam.
@LindsyxDanielle if you need to talk or something I'm here.
@terkzz you should come here it's not snowing! ...yet =/
Also on another note I'm not wrestling the weather to put a sign up. Yet I'm still covered in paint.
I remembered.
I've been to busy to work with this much but @ClandestineHan is a beast when it comes to drawing. 
It's toooooo fucking cold to be outside putting up a fucking sign. 
As my ankle cracks in pain every little turn. I just think if I can't start work on Monday... Someone will be sorry.
Sometimes you just have that breakdown/meltdown. And after that you still feel like shit.
I'm just gonna be retweeting most of @ClandestineHan tweets. Cause.
@SamuelLJackson send me a pair of those! Please!
I'm one good ache or pain or twist here or pull there from living off a bottle of pain relievers.
None of this really matter cause I'm just gonna become a famous rapper anyways.
And yes that has to do with everything and everyone.
Just gonna be done with people for awhile. Cause who needs friends?
I've given up on these quarter machine dreams.
I keep having like the same dream. It's weird.
Fuck it.
I mean people, work, everything. Just done.
I know I've said it before but I'm just done with everything.
I need a mother fucking haircut.
@OfficialKingIce I ordered a necklace and some earrings on Saturday. And will most likely be getting more.
I go to text someone then think and delete it knowing I won't get a response.
Why the fuck do I even bother?
@Aimss28 cute.

@ClandestineHan you're welcome!! =)
@LindsyxDanielle I believe it.
I'm just tryin to make it out alive but even that seems impossible nowadays.
@LindsyxDanielle good! =)
@LindsyxDanielle you're exactly right! So don't be!
So now that the day is half over.
Just opened my letter from @ClandestineHan and not only is she a beast at art but her handwriting is way better than mine!
@ClandestineHan welcome! Haha.
@ClandestineHan nothin wrong with that! Lol.
@Trizzio ok.
Man fuck you.
I just like the nicer things in life. Hats. Nice shoes. And necklaces. Drip ice even in the summer.
@LindsyxDanielle worth a try. Lol.
@LindsyxDanielle both.
My dad turns on the country awards and then falls asleep. Go to bed so I can play GTA.
Wish I could figure out what is wrong with my foot/ankle.
Just let me lay here and die.
It's almost that holiday time again...
I just want to watch the game. I don't want to hear shit from you or anyone.
I guess I can start my day.
What do we do the day after Halloween? Write a Halloween rap.
I'm pissed.
I think there's something really wrong with my foot/ankle. But no one would care so... I'll just get a wrap or a brace for it.
It's Halloween night the way it should be. Watching the @chicagobulls and #DRose
So much for getting to see tip off.
I rarely get excited for things but the @chicagobulls game tomorrow night is something I'm excited for! @JoakimNoah @drose @TajGibson22
@sidsgraphs this is awesome. He's been my favorite TE since he started in the league. 
And that it's always reoccurring in my dreams that it floods over into my real life. So I never know what is real. And I'm hardly ever happy
Until I get so down and depressed I just don't want to do a damn thing. And it's even worse that there's hardly anyone I can even trust.
I'm just not sure about a lot of things and I can't/don't have anyone to really talk to about it. So it all just builds up inside.
It doesn't even compare mother fucker. Not even fuckin close.
I'm really just looking to get drunk tonight.
Sittin in New Lenox wishing I could still be in bed. Or at least at home.
You only look a little fake.
Can it just be next weekend so I can get drunk.
It's happening again.
Someone text me. 708-476-0288.
@dear_tragedy_ you're very beautiful and sexy.
I need breakfast.
I spent my teenage years wishful thinking. So I'll spend my 20's wishful drinking.
@hollicroft it was nice too. So fuck them.
Maybe I deserve all this. But don't blame me for your ignorance.
Listening to The Black Parade. Cause why not?
Cause every night I go to bed lonely as fuck and nothing changes. So let me do what I fucking want.
Racks on racks on racks.
Well you know what fuck them. If I had someone to spend money I would. I don't. So more stuff for me.
An there's probably people thinking "man that's a selfish thing to say" or "he's a dick" or shit like that.
I'm gonna have all this money and the only person to spend it on is myself. It's a hard knock life. I tell you.
There's no turning back. I reached out. So fuck you.
Jump off a bridge.
@ClandestineHan then it's worth it!
@ClandestineHan fashionably late.
I wouldn't mind talking to you. But oh well...
Got the rest of my costume today. Get ready. "I'm in waste management."
Fuck you then.
I'm not angry by this. Just find it ironic. And funny. I still say its cause I voted for Obama.
Not only did I get "kicked out" of my church. My uncle/god father signed the letter kicking me out.
Lets put the past behind us.
Someone text me. 708-476-0288.
And a lot of money.
On another note. Starting next week I'll be working at least 40 hours a week. So I won't have a life.
If you rely on the government to give you money on a fucking card to feed your fucking kid. Maybe you shouldn't have had a kid at 21.
That's not something I'm going to feel sorry for you on. You put yourself in that situation.
The new $100 are out. And reading about them they sound awesome.
Weird ass fucking dream... I didn't like it.
@ClandestineHan you're welcome.
@ClandestineHan feel better!!! =)
So can I marry Demi Lovato.
@ClandestineHan the short version is Jason wants to spend time with his wife. But then he tweeted saying he's going to post a thing tomorrow
=( So goodnight moon and goodnight you... Goodnight Go Radio... =(
@ClandestineHan =( I just read the blog it's got me in tears...
@styhppystycatie he should be. At least I hope he is.
@styhppystycatie yea. He said if the games were important he'd play through but might miss a few of the preseason games.
@styhppystycatie he had a groin issue and didn't want to aggravate it or anything.
Looking to get a new necklace but I don't know what the pendant should be. Any ideas?
I'm just tryin to buy a Cadillac.
But mom cash kinda puts credit in the ground.
My mom said I can't buy a car cause I have no credit...
@ClandestineHan ok! =)
@ClandestineHan wanna go to Italy with me?
Even if I wanted to get ahold of you I sure as fuck wouldn't know how or what to say.
The days you work 2 jobs instead of one. Means one thing. Money.
About this whole government shut down thing. I'm most mad that its more than likely gonna delay the release of the new $100.
Don't question my madness if you don't like my answer.
So goodnight moon and goodnight you.
@ClandestineHan ok! That's what I'll do! =) and ill always take care of you cause you take care of me. =)
If stay up till midnight to tell @ClandestineHan happy birthday but I'm already half asleep. Does that make me a bad person?
Tomorrow's October 1st you know what that means.
@LionBloodBrand are you gonna get bigger sizes like 5XL?
@DetroitLionsNFL watching the game with my family being the only lions fan. #CHIvsDET #OhWell #OnePride
@ClandestineHan that was before I turned into one haha. And if that's the case you aren't one either!
@ClandestineHan you haven't met me yet then.
I'm sorry but pumpkin everything for the fall is fucking gross. Like why the fuck do they put it in EVERYTHING?! So fucking gross.
Someone come make me dinner. I haven't eaten since 12 and I've been drinking since 8.
@nate_robinson you say all sizes. Does that include us big guys?
The worst part of living in Illinois is that I'm a @DetroitLionsNFL fan.
Fuck this.
Can I move to California now? I'm sick of being here. I just want my own place so I can lock the door and be by myself.
I'm not even trying to exist to the rest of the world. Yet here I am.
I'm just getting so sick of that bitch. I mean you can only be nice to someone for so long. And we're way past that.
So what. I fucked up. I'm sorry. But I miss you.
Who really can you trust anymore?
I have an Instagram. So make of it what you want.
@gerardway yes I have!
Picasso baby.
So fuck everything.
I'm just so fucking done with all this shit.
I've been stuck in this hell for months and never get to do shit.
I'm tired hearing about your trip cause I have to run your business. At least you get a fucking trip.
I just wish I had someone to talk to.
Hello 4 in the morning. You seem very peaceful and quiet.
I'm poppin bills like poppin bottles. Just to get better I guess.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm sick... =/
I miss My Chemical Romance.
I think I'm falling apart. But this time fuck picking up the pieces.
No one should ever see what goes on in my head.
With all the bull shit days I'm getting this week maybe I'll treat myself to the ps3/gta5 bundle.
I guess I have less friends. Oh well. Such is life.
We work too hard not to
#HTTR
@LindsyxDanielle feel better!
Fuck galaxy phones. They suck.
@NFLONFOX don't really care about replays and etc. just want to watch the game.
I love almost getting into car accidents...
I wish my life was exciting.
Someone should text me though.
I spend my time watching the last 2 episodes of the sopranos on repeat. #getonmylevel
I just think you're beautiful.
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships.
Time to go see a man about a horse.
@ClandestineHan you're welcome. Haha.
@ClandestineHan your body may think so but your facial expression says otherwise. Lol.
@ClandestineHan you look rather tired.
@mercedesarnhorn drink til your dead.
Goodnight moon.
I'm tired of everything so I guess goodnight... Text me if you want.
Someone text me.
And I'll just blame everything on you.
Just writing in circles cause money just began.
Now back to our regular scheduled programming.
This is my people shooting hat. I shoot people in this hat.
On that note.
Cause it's just like Holden Caulfield said everyone in this world no matter who are fuckin phonies.
Cause if something has to happen, if its good or bad, for you to talk to me I won't believe a fucking second of it.
If something in my life happened and all these people were talking to me I'd probably tell them off.
Tell me I'm a heartless mother fucker. See if I give a shit.
Dirty sprite. Haha.
I'm ready for some fuckin sleep.
@ClandestineHan well that's good. =)
@ClandestineHan my bad. Lol.
I feel like I could go weeks without talking to anyone. And no one would ask about me.
I'm ready for bed.
I need more people to talk to.
Kill it.
You could say I'm addicted to it like its cocaine.
But fuck it cause I do it for the money.
Cause it's gonna be hot as fuck tomorrow and I'll be outside in it.
Just waiting to download the @2chainz cd then I can go to bed.
Who wants to draw me something??
@terkzz no slanty face young lady! If you want to talk I'm here. =)
@terkzz cheer up!
Not gonna lie I miss you.
Can it just get cold out.
@ClandestineHan sounds kinda perfect.
Got the A$AP Rocky cd yesterday. And it's pretty good. Gonna get the 2 Chainz cd on Tuesday. Then I might be done buying CDs for awhile.
If I offend you chances are I know and I don't give a fuck. So just keep walking.
Woke up at one. Then 4. Then 5:30. Now I'm wide awake at 6:30. So I guess I need someone to talk to.
Can't wait till I get a haircut.
Someone should text me.
Playing it I mean. Yea FOB got back together. But that cd was... Lets not discuss that.
I pretty much gave up on rock music after MCR broke up.
Just buying CDs on CDs on CDs. Guess which ones!
I just want breakfast. And maybe a monster. Or 3.
Goodnight moon.
I never do much on the weekends. So they seem pointless. I still wake up at 5 I just don't have to work.
All black Cadillac.
I want a bullet proof vest too. Not that I need it I just think they look badass. Am I wrong?
I'm ready for October and 60 degree days. Sweatshirt weather. All that fuckin shit. Cause I like layers.
And I'm sick of this warm weather. It's making me miserable.
But other than that I'm just gonna go to bed. Cause being awake is just boring.
I'm lookin to buy a coat. One with a gun pocket.
Someone text me.
Sopranos all night? Why not.
I spend my nights alone writing. Then dreaming. Sometimes drinking. And always thinking.
Someone text me. I could use a conversation.
It's not about saying fuck you. It's about saying fuck everything about you.
@ClandestineHan =) I'm glad to hear that! =)
I will say @ClandestineHan is one of my favorite people in this world.
@ClandestineHan feel better! =)
Even though I typed that from my iPod. Not my phone.
My exciting news for today. I switched my phone case. Mind=blown.
Sorry we hardly talk anymore. But my phones always on.
Well I'll bury myself if no one wants to help.
I want a crew like @MacMiller has. People that will always be there.
Let me go on record saying I miss you.
@EthanFATS I still do it with a gameboy.
I really just wish I had more people to talk to.
Someone text me.
That's as close to a vacation as I'll get in awhile. Now finally time for Sopranos.
And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week.
I hate waking up this early cause there's no one to talk to. Someone text me.
I wanna sleep. But I need to finish this 32 race set for Mario Kart. Damn this cruel world.
Can I get kicked out of Christianity?
Playing Mario Kart all night. Keep me company. Text me.
1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 20 million. 
Oh, I'm so good at math.
Someone should text me.
Gonna get "kill it" tattooed somewhere on me.
I'm just gonna get drunk and watch the sopranos all night. Cause who's needs to go out.
Possibly getting a tattoo between October and December.
@Modelmichaela that's Big Sean.
That's how I can stack my paper sky high. Even if every step I take I feel like I'm gonna die.
I really wanted tomorrow off. But it's another 40 hour week.
My eyes are wide open but I can't see straight. You're callin this life but the calls always late.
I'm just trying to get to target to buy the @BigSean cd. But of course on my day off I have to work my second job.
But I digress.
Someone conversate with me.
I mean I really just want someone to talk to. Other than twitter.
Someone text me.
Don't show me to much cause I don't plan on being here the rest of my life.
The good thing about not having any friends is that I can go to the gym and not miss any texts.
Someone should text me. Strike up a conversation or some shit.
We are the doom riders rolling through your town. 
Flee to your house of prayer and we will burn it down.
All these people talking about how mainstream music sucks and this and that...I hope if I make it to the VMAs people love me like macklemore
If I ever went to an awards show. I'd bring someone with. Don't know who. But someone.
Drake didn't start from the bottom. He stared on degrassi. And Canada isn't the bottom. It's the top. Get him a map.
So when can I have a show on MTV?
Preach all you want but who's gonna save me?
I got a new sweatshirt today. I have about 10 sweatshirts. But you can never have too many.
Give me a reason to believe.
Bored...
Who can guess what my least favorite thing about money is?
Someone text me.
I think my first tattoo will be a Kill Hannah tattoo. Then a My Chemical Romance tattoo. Then maybe a quote from the Sopranos.
I'm gonna get a house. And you won't be invited over. Not because of who you are. But because it'll be in California.
It's a My Chemical Romance weekend.
And bullshit. But no one ever comes out and says that.
Cheer up? Why the fuck would I do something like that?
That's why I'm doing this. Takin aim at everyone.
So I know no one is holding me back.
What am I looking to get out of this? "Being able to stand on my own for the first time in years."
@LindsyxDanielle you'll do great!!
"I'm takin aim at anyone who left a knife in my back."
But damn this apple is fucking great.
I then ripped up the letter. Said go fuck yourself. And put it in the trash. And the world wonders why I hate church and religion.
It said I should come back and if they could help me by doing something to come back they would. Or help my find another church.
I got this letter from the church last week.
I'm just gonna eat this apple and talk shit. Cause that's what I do best. Talk shit.
So can you tell me what will you do,
When everything you know turns right around on you.
There is a price that we all must pay.
I'm not sorry for the mistake I have made.
I should get something really bad tattooed on my knuckles. Like "fuck ...." Never mind. I shouldn't tweet it.
Someone text me.
Good morning!
Just sayin fuck you. And everything about you.
If you don know there's a reason for it. If you wanna act cold there's a season for it.
Tonight should be fun?
Buildin bridges just to burn.
Someone text me.
Until recently I never wanted to live in California. Now it's the only place I want to live.
Call me bitter as fuck. See if I give a fuck.
I don't plan on being here my whole life. I don't plan on taking over the business. Get that through your head first.
If you go out of town for something that has nothing to do with your business. Why the fuck should I have to run your business?
Someone should text me before I go to bed.
I'm not saying I'm writing a rap about Romeo &amp; Juliet. All I'm saying is I'm using words like Verona and Juliet and Capulet.
But after all this time there's now another really cute girl that works at speedway. And I mean really cute.
And I know people move and quit or whatever.
I remember when I started working in New Lenox and there was this one cute girl at speedway.
I'm gonna feel this tomorrow. Maybe that workout wasn't a good idea.
I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed.
It also needs to be football season. Like now.
It needs to be Saturday so I can get my hat.
You know how people get tattoos of the Cadillac symbol? Fuck that. I'm gettin a tattoo of the Rolls Royce symbol.
And the 2 Chainz cd.
Can't wait until the Big Sean cd comes out.
Someone text me.
When my friends say they want a boat I just tell them no. No they don't.
Going to the gym later...cause why not?
Misery loves company but I'm still standing alone.
I'm not saying I'm tired of the world. Just the people on it.
It's nice to have a social life again. Even though I'm not social.
Lookin for that job with a paycheck. Ridin on a truck all day long.
I don't know where I'm headed but I'm going insane.
I got that white boy swagger rappin' right down to a T.
@LindsyxDanielle oh ok. =) haha.
@LindsyxDanielle everything ok?
Paramore is just bad. Really bad.
@LindsyxDanielle cheer up!
I'm not tired. Someone text me.
For as much pain as I'm in. I'd rather be dead.
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes.
I'm gonna be deep in that shoe game.
Don't live like you might die today. Live like you're gonna beat up today just to get to tomorrow.
Let's chat. Maybe?
Someone text me. 708-476-0288.
Who really can I trust now a days...
I've written a few songs that get very personal. But nothing, nothing like this.
If they gave you a hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I've lost and gained enough friend to know none of it means anything.
I'm an asshole you can say it to my face. But who gives a fuck when you're makin all this bank.
I had the weirdest fucking dream last night.
Wait wait wait. There's a town in Illinois called Dixmoor?
@LindsyxDanielle I will. Probably tomorrow! =)
I haven't talked to @LindsyxDanielle in awhile. The last time I fell asleep. I should text her.
I got shoes for every occasion. But since I'm Chi-town reppin my dress shoes are red white and blue @drose shoes.
I can say I'm doing ok. Which is better than yesterday.
Everyday on the way to work there's this 2 door black Cadillac. I'm gonna buy it.
I'm gonna get a tattoo this winter. I think. Maybe.
I just wanna say. Fuck you.
The quickest way to my heart is a bottle of powerade.
I always wake up at this time. It kinda sucks.
Actually all the CDs I've recently gotten have been really fucking good and there's still 2 that are coming out that will be great.
Magna Carter is a really great cd.
This some new shit. 
Hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with.
So what we learned is the world is full of hypocrites.
There's something really wrong with my shoulder.
I just don't know...
"You never were a friend in the first place."
Everything I have I've paid for. I don't go out every night, I don't ask for money to go out. I work multiple jobs and save up for stuff.
Sometimes you need to think of your future. How are you gonna make money if you aren't working? Make your parents pay for everything?
The people in this world just piss me off.
I might be a terrible person but I'm so good at it.
You can only write so many love songs before they turn into murder.
Who's ready for me to do something with my life?
@alexanderdeleon wait. Are you at the cubs game?
Nothing compares to the sadness of the last episode of The Sopranos. Just knowing they can never make more... =(
Dude got his head ran over. Damn.
Yes I am going to sample Bring Me The Horizon on my mixtape.
You're nothing to this world. Sorry to be honest but someone has to say it.
You just look desperate. Not very famous. Hit me when you're in the lights of Vegas.
Goodbye means forever.
This is the way it should have always been.
Someone talk to me.
I guess we're done talking now.
I make your entire savings in a week.
People need to open their eyes. Look at the world around you and not what something that is fake wants you to live.
And don't be surprised if you're just another fuckin stranger in my eyes.
I'm here to make people like me. Cause i really don't care what you fuckin think of me.
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit. 
Now they problems he got to deal with.
If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife you left in my back.
People sellin' drugs cause they can't find no job. 
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross.
There is a hell believe me I've seen it. There is a heaven lets keep it a secret.
Don't worry you won't hear from me again.
When @ddlovato tweets Jay-Z lyrics you know it's true love.
I'm done with you from here on out.
@ClandestineHan perfect. =)
@chaseclymer I feel your pain.
I don't trust anyone. Cause whenever I look at someone all I see is a snake.
There's a handful of people I hate. No wait. That's the handful I can kinda stand. The rest of the world I hate.
A life alone always sounds better in the dark.
I'm done.
@BigBlack one that says "Big Blacks got your back."
Fuck em if they can't take a joke.
I'm just gonna close my eyes and watch the world pass me by.
Soup is great.
Calm down. The world is still spinning.
I'm going to California.
Legit though my shoulder is screwed up.
@courtneyforce good luck. Hope you can get the win!
I'm in a lot of pain and feeling very sick. So goodnight.
I need to ask @ClandestineHan if she would draw my symbol. She would make it the best.
There's nothing I hate more than family. Not all family just a few that I can't stand. Maybe that's wrong but I don't give a shit.
How about I don't go to this family party today. How's that sound to everyone.
I hate that I'm wide awake but half asleep. Text me.
Bet you don't.
It's not even 9 and I'm in bed on a Friday night.
Fuckin bitch.
There's so much more I could say. I'm not going to cause I don't want to offend anyone.
The day your dues are paid is the day you are 6 feet under.
You have to put in hard work. And your dues are never paid. Doesn't matter who you are or how your life is lived.
I think you're fucking full of shit. Open your eyes and look at the world around you. Things don't just fall out of the sky.
I don't need your fucking answers since I never asked the fucking questions.
Umm I'll pass.
Who wants to draw me a symbol?
Every night I'm placing bets with my demons.
So now I guess it's goodnight. Cause tomorrow I have to wake up for work. So goodnight world see you sometime.
I'm not trying to make sense cause that would be easy. I'm just going on about what's on my mind till I fall asleep tonight.
They say something about one door closing another one opens but if its locked how far do you get if you can't find the key in the dark.
And who gives a fuck if we all go our separate ways? That's what the world is preparing us for.
Cause these familiar faces just look like strangers I've never seen.
I'm just in a dark place waiting for someone to turn a light on.
For real though someone text me.
Someone text me. 708-476-0288.
@HardRockHope living the dream.
Gettin a new phone today. Although I don't talk to anyone so I don't see why I need to drop $250 on a new phone. But oh well.
I went to bed at 6. Now I'm just wide awake. Text me.
So are we ever gonna talk again?
I have a hangover. Can anyone tell me what that means?
All these people are like warped tomorrow and I'm like work tomorrow. Sorry but I'd rather make money then spend money.
I'm saying my goodbyes cause we probably won't speak again.
Fuck you.
Fight a dirty fight that way you at least fought.
When I go I'm gonna leave a notebook behind with all my thoughts in it.
Someone text me while I watch sopranos.
You want a dog that's $200 but you can't get a bag of bagels? The fuck?
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today.
Like my final thought every night before I go to bed. Could bring the strongest man to his knees.
I wouldn't say I'm strange or weird. I'm just different.
I'm just waiting for basketball season. #TheReturn @drose
I burned my thumb today so that's cool.
Besides anyone should know better than to say that to me.
Ignorance is bliss. And sad.
Fuck it.
There goes that idea..
Someone text me.
But anyways I guess we're not gonna talk. So cool.
All you do is talk.
Just fuck em. Move on without them.
There's reasons I leave people behind in life. So add your name to the list.
I mean we fucking planned this shit in may. And you don't call off work? Fuck it.
I just hate people like that.
Don't know why I bother...
Yes I did just buy the Cosmo with @ddlovato on the cover. Don't judge me.
My shoes came!!!!
You're a pretty horrible person. And I know horrible people.
Fuck it though. Waste my time.
Someone text me.
Kill me. I'm in so much pain.
How can you trust a guy who can literally go fuck themselves?
They have both male and female sex organs. That’s why somebody you don’t trust you call a snake.
Someone should text me. Be friendly.
I wonder why we don't talk anymore.
Give me something to put me to sleep.
Don't hold on if the grips to tight.
Burning bridges to my island.
Never ask me if I'm ok. I'll always say yes.
And don't worry. If I'm smiling I've probably been drinking.
You talk high and mighty but I'll see you in hell with the rest of us.
You'd be haunted at night too.
If only you could see the world the way I do...
I got them battle scars I brush it off and keep walking.
@RonnieRadke I started listening to you back in high school. An haven't stopped yet. You're music has gotten me through all the tough times.
Someone text me.
Seriously fuck everything right now.
Goodnight.
So let us all go our separate ways. That way we can forget the goodbyes and just start new.
So really who lost touch with who and who wants to keep in touch? Cause its not even like we care about each other that much.
And when I look at them they're just strangers to me. But it's the same when I look in the mirror.
And all of us just lost touch and no one seemed to care to get it back so I just kept living my life.
It's easier that way. Just stay in every night and not see anyone.
Who knows anymore. There's just so many people I can't stand anymore. And it's not good cause to avoid them I avoid the whole world.
It seems everyone is in a relationship and I'm just trying to put out a mixtape.
I'm not great with goodbyes, so...
For real though my shoulder blade is pretty fucked up from work.
But really someone text me. Cause I'm in a really shitty mood now...
Someone text me. I'm broken.
@ClandestineHan and responsibility.
Straight up hate people like that. So fucking dumb.
You know what. Fuck it.
I should probably get to sleep.
@Trizzio what's Kevin Durant like?
@ClandestineHan no buts! Paint!
@S_C_ what's the best advice you can give someone that wants to join the rap game?
@S_C_ thank you for all the music you've ever put out.
I hope my shit ships today. So I can order my @BigBlack stuff this weekend or next.
Someone text me.
Love is just a word that's in songs and movies. It doesn't mean anything.
Don't hit me up when I'm gone.
@LindsyxDanielle sounds good to me! Haha.
@LindsyxDanielle take me with you. Please.
Cause sometimes I wanna say fuck the world and fuck you.
You tell me what a friend is, I'll tell you if I have any.
I could write some of the most deep, dark, depressing things. But no one would ever read them. So it would be like I never wrote them.
@ClandestineHan I'm not up on this snapchat stuff! I don't even have a smart phone! Livin in the 90's over here thank you very much!
@ClandestineHan no! That would have been creepy!!!
@ClandestineHan at first I thought it was! Haha.
@ClandestineHan there was a girl at the cubs game that looked just like you!
Goin to Chi City today.
I'd like to have a conversation with someone.
Or not... That's cool too.
I'd love to sleep for a whole day.
Headed to the gym then to get drunk.
@LondonFATS @FATSBAND once a liar.
I'm just gonna stay by myself. It's easier that way I would think. But what do I know? Nothing.
Ordered my shoes.
But seriously I'll probably be up most of the night so talk to me unless I offended you.
There's people I used to be good friends with that I don't even talk to anymore or hardly talk to.
So what if I spend most of my time alone? These 4 walls never let me down.
If the worlds up there ^ I'm down here __.
Got the Jay-Z cd without having a samsung phone. So suck it samsung.
Story of my life everything's fucking disappointment.
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real.
And I been thinking about her all the time. I never seen somebody put together perfectly.
People love you when they on your mind. A thought is love's currency.
@terkzz only if you take me with you.
Spending $100 on shoes makes me feel like a sellout. But when they're usually $160 makes me feel ok.
I just want to talk to someone. But I don't.
When to bed at 1. Woke up at 5. So there's that. Text me.
Yesterday kinda sucked though.
Shits just awkward as hell.
Been up since 6. Just got back from the gym. I don't see how people sleep late.
I'm a grade A douche bag.
Somedays you just wanna say fuck it all. And just give up on everything.
I'm not saying the world is a disappointment... But yea it is.
Sometimes it's easier not to have friends and just do everything by yourself. Cause then you don't have to worry about anyone.
I might be drunk. Or tired. What's the difference? Either way I have to wake up for work tomorrow.
I hate all things park forest.
Sorry but it's true.
I don't see how people around my age have kids or are having kids. I mean you're like 21/22. Your life is done at that point.
Sorry just quoting @MacMiller
When I die throw a couple bad bitches in my casket.
When I die will she fuck my hologram though?
One workout done. Now sleep. Then tonight second workout.
I wish you knew how I felt. Or what goes on in my mind. Cause you wouldn't last a day in these shoes.
Cuttin the ties between us. And I hope you fall cause I won't be there to even try and catch you.
I knew it.
Just sick of all the bullshit from you.
If I had a dollar every time you said that I'd probably be rich.
So forget it. Goodnight world. Let nightmares ruin your dreams.
I hate your bad tattoos and your second hand stories.
And fuck summer and "friends" and you and all this other bullshit.
And I'm sick.
The worst part is I'm wide awake but my mind is gone...
It's not me, it's you.
No point in waiting.
Don't know.
Figures. Why should I even text you.
If I followed myself I'd unfollow myself cause I'm just annoying.
It looks like I'm drunk it feels like I'm dying. I won't believe a word you say you're usually lying.
I need food too. But that's the farthest thing from my mind.
Or I could die. That would work too.
I either need to wake up or go to bed for the night.
Fuck that.
I'm moving to Pasadena California. Why? It's exactly 4 hours from Vegas.
What's a family vacation? Better yet what's a family?
Death.
I'm pretty sure I pulled something in my shoulder.
Friends? Who needs friends with enemies like these?
If you're happy I'm fucking fantastic.
Too late. Sorry.
I know what I want in life. Now I just need to get it.
I guess my question is, can I just die now?
Drunk parents are like kids. And I hate both.
I guess we're better off forgotten.
Just forget it. Fuck you.
when a heart breaks it never breaks even.
Someone text me while I look for my phone.
Just sitting here thinking what's the point of life.
"When I die will you leave something on my headstone?"
And I don't care.
It's safe to say we're not friends anymore.
In other words fuck people who get butt hurt over a company or a product and then bash it without bullshit ass facts.
I'm so glad people talk only about what they read on the internet and live life by it and don't look at the whole picture.
I'm pretty sure I'm dying. I'm pretty sure you don't care.
That dream will be on my mind all day...
Weird fucking dream...
Guess you don't want to talk. Bye!
Someone text me.
I should just go to sleep. Cause fuck it.
So I know everyone is still excited about the Blackhawks. But I got an email saying I can get @BigBlack stuff with no shipping, so... Win!
What's the point?
@terkzz *waves bye*
I feel like I should be like celebrating or something but I have work in the morning. So uhhhh yea...
Wait is it basketball season yet?
How long does it take to score a goal?
On a side note why bother. It's not worth my time.
I know hockey terms too. Like 3 pointer, shot clock, and 24 second violation...wait... Never mind.
And again...bite my tongue.
I'll just bite my tongue at that one.
Guess not. Done wasting my time. It's not fucking worth it.
The question is will we actually talk today?
Someone text me.
@ClandestineHan good! =)
I want to make a music video in the ice cream parlor where the final scene of The Sopranos was. Make it happen.
@ClandestineHan why? =(
The only bad thing about California is I don't care for any of the sports teams.
Can I go back to bed?
It's been awhile since I've been content. I always just drifted by. My hearts busted. It doesn't even know what it wants.
That moment where you're lonely as fuck and you don't want to fall asleep cause you know your dreams will be empty.
I just feel like its a waste of time to try to talk to you.
Or not. Oh well.
But really what hat should I wear tonight?
take a long walk off a short pier
On a side note, if you don't know how many zeros are in a million you don't have the motivation to get there.
@BigSean needs to release the date of his new cd. I've been waiting a year for it now!
This is probably my favorite picture right now. It's so respectful yet depressing. 
Just fuck today already.
Soooooo who's buying me breakfast?
Look alive, sunshine.
Someone text me. Please.
All I want to do is go to the gym, watch the basketball game and go to sleep. So bye.
The news of it just really makes me upset...
R.I.P. Tony Soprano.
Didn't talk to anyone tonight. Goodnight.
The heat don't deserve to win another championship.
#respectlost
It doesn't matter what I have to say.
This is why I won't feel bad.
Actually... I won't feel bad.
Someone text me.
@ClandestineHan nice! =) I like it!
@ClandestineHan new car?
Workout done. Now I'm gonna go back to sleep.
Just gonna write. So text me.
Just half ass listened to the new SWS cd...and I don't know... It's .....yea....
@ClandestineHan cause its 10. =)
You're not gonna like me in about a week. But I'm not here to please everyone.
Storms here...
@ClandestineHan shame. =(
Good night workout. Now I should sleep. But text me if you want.
She said I should grow up like get a bank account. I threw $1000 in the air and said no but you can count.
@MacMiller I'm goin to best buy Tuesday just for your cd.
Maybe I don't facebook right but every time I read someone's status I just want to stab my eyes out.
People just put me in a shit mood.
Goodnight moon.
@ClandestineHan I usually reply with "that's cause I'm awesome".
@ClandestineHan yay! =)
When my mixtape is ready, I wonder if @ClandestineHan will draw/paint its album cover.
Someone text me. I'm feeling chatty.
Money's the motivation.
Gettin free stuff from coke. And I ain't talkin nose bleeds.
@LindsyxDanielle makes sense to me.
Goodnight moon and goodnight you.
Stackin money face to face. What that mean CPR?
Whenever I workout my arms hurt for at least 2 days afterwards. To where I think they're just falling off.
@LindsyxDanielle why were you walking in the dark? Haha.
@LindsyxDanielle that sounds more painful than cool.
As for now you're gonna hear the saddest songs.
Just tryin' to stay above sea level.
Someone just keep me company. Cause every high has its low. And mines there.
@Luke1luk San Antonio.
Fuck it. No point in texting you anymore.
I don't really want to work today.
Text me.
If you ask me if I'm ok most likely no matter how I feel I'll say I'm fine.
I'm not gonna text anyone this week and see who texts me. If anyone.
Going to the gym in a little bit. Got a playlist that's about 3.5 hours long. Goodbye afternoon.
@ClandestineHan well get better!
No.
Get a job and save up for your 401K. Fuck that I'd rather be young as shit counting 401K.
On that note. Goodnight world. I'll start looking for a new family tomorrow.
Cause you can say what you want online. But in person you better be ready to stand up to what you said.
If you want to throw me in a conversation I'm not a part of. Say it to my mother fucking face and not on facebook.
One last thing about how I have no "family".
Just laying in bed thinking too much.
It's hard for me to find a time where I'm not depressed.
@DavidFATS you never will.
Or not.
Someone text me.
Beautiful with the brown eyes. Telling stories based on white lies.
Some people say its all about family. I'll say fuck that. I'm sick of family. "High class, I'm just surrounded by these low lifes."
@LindsyxDanielle haha. They were good too!
@LindsyxDanielle that's what I had for breakfast!
Someone should text me. Or something.
Cause you're runnin around doin all this shit like "yolo". And I'm sittin here like no... Polo.
Pull the fast life at this age. Bet you burn out before the rest of us.
I shouldn't stay up past midnight.
