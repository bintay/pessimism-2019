@Eedzz @ieatfrogs11 I guess he already is since he's bothering me and we're not even following eachother on here.
@Eedzz oh my honeybee <HONEYBEE><YELLOW HEART>
@ieatfrogs11 @Eedzz wanna be the queen of the fan club?
I came out swinging from a South Philly basement caked in stale beer and sweat, under half lit fluorescents. 
To Dead Throne or to 8:18, hmm...
@ieatfrogs11 @Eedzz looking for a way to be relevant I see.
"Science is good", words of wisdom from Nicoli.
'Splorin around like Children of the Corn. 
We're literally always down for sushi. @Eedzz 
@Eedzz took me for a sushi date and the song from Titanic is playing when we walk in ;)
Those poor, unfortunate souls who never emerged and evolved from their scene phase.
@Eedzz you are a beautiful human, helping count this down! ♡
All these small things going well, are starting to outweigh this shitty situation. #310MoreDays

Shout to the bar playing Star Wars trap music right now!!!
We would have negative friends if anyone ever saw the way @Eedzz and I dance when we're in the car together.
I'm really confused as to why twitter sometimes notifies of @aaronmatts activities... I don't care what that nerd is doing!

Alone singing along to Repo the Genetic Opera on the top of my little lungs. <OK HAND SIGN>
I've got the countdown to March 14th going on my home screen everyday. #311DaysLeft 
Holy shit I'm stressed.
I fuck with applesauce so heavy.
Alone at the apartment watching IT.
@SamShapiroMedia I'm very close to saying im proud of you.
My bestfriend seriously knows me, and knows how to make me smile! She just bought me a pair of Doc Martens! I love you so @AlieHouseOfGray ♡
Hey there smile, I was beginning to think I'd lost you. 
This place is so dank. 
@rikaandthewolf I'm getting back in shape my damn self! Lemme know!!!
@rikaandthewolf I completely agree. I've always wanted to be a tattoo model and shit, it would be sick! You're right!
@rikaandthewolf we're hip and rad and stuff. Can we please?!
About to hit this First Watch Cafe for breakfast.
@rikaandthewolf let's do it!
Me going out for breakfast with the crew right now. 
@AlieHouseOfGray that's a great fucking story. Can I hear it again... do you have time?
@Eedzz @AlieHouseOfGray I could say the same for you two dingbats.
Found a company that makes the sickest handmade plugs, but of course they don't go up to my size. 
<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I wonder if the same person creeping me right now for being happy, is the same one who things I give a fuck about me ex as a tumblr anon? Hm
My sleep schedule, if I can even call it that anymore, is so filthy right now. Killin the game.
If I have to get up and kick these pesky kids off my imaginary front lawn...
Shout out to the broads slamming doors and bouncing around on the stairs outside the apartment... if you don't get in your damn house.
Where did that weird little dimple thing come from? This is what I get for smiling. 
Uh, can I help you? You could probably creep me a little better on instagram as well, just make sure to hit the heart every now and again <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Why did I drink a monster before bed? Dingus.
@AndrewCTE waaaaaay to go andrew. Wow.
Zack is being the Oprah Winfrey of pizza right now, everybody gets one!
Battle Royale is so far one of the sickest Japanese horror movies I've seen yet.
Japanese horror movies will always be my favorite.
*rips ecig*

I don't smoke bro, this is a vape.
When people get mad at for smoking hookah but not cigarettes because it's worse... cooooool. *fills lungs with charcoal*
@Chrisfotch don't even start with me homie.

@Chrisfotch you fuggeaboutit
I always feel just a wee bit of love when I know my bestest friend @Chrisfotch is stalking me all the way from New York <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
My bestfriend has Hello Kitty behind both ears, and I hate that about her.

<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Just saw a girl with pretty much just her throat tattooed... just stop everything you're doing.
Literally doing laundry at 2am since I don't sleep anymore <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><PISTOL>
@mathyourowe omg. That's my stepdad.
i swear to god my vape has literally been charging for a million years
Watching Public Enemies because this movie is fucking badass.
@BennSuede stooooop.
*rips ecig*
Forced dukes to listen to metal earlier. 
Blowin' straight spaghetti-o rings rn.
@AlieHouseOfGray actually really loves me. Especially when I kiss her face. ;)♡ 
There are two kinds of people in this world: people who watch full screen, and people who watch wide screen.
Trying to retrain my hair to do something different. We'll see how long before I give up.
@shaunamustdie bring meeee!
@shaunamustdie forever 21 is my go to

@shaunamustdie I know how to shop! Of course, I look like a cross between Wednesday Adams and Children of the Corn
My 40yo bar back just said, "Internet is life, internet is love. Internet is my god. I live to serve the internet. You will be assimilated"
Finished all my shows. So while I'm waiting for new seasons, I need something new to watch on Netflix.
Going to be that obnoxious douche bag that declares today Revenge of the Sixth.
Dear Universal, 
You ruined my childhood by taking out King Kong, and now you want to rebuild it?
Die.
-Angry Youth.
Just when I thought I had nothing going on this summer... this could very well be the most interesting summer yet!
@AndrewCTE voted for you Dingus
Watched the bros in @CrownTheEmpire whole set on Skype last night. Still annoying them from 1000 miles away :)
Happy and optimistic for the first time in a long time. I would like to thank all my homies for that.
Hahahahah and don't you forget it!!! @AndrewCTE
Lord have mercy!
The amount of throwback in the music coming from my phone right now has me feeling some type of way.
Siiiick. My router decided halfway through an online match that it didn't want to play anymore... currently raging.
@CiBabs I was just thinking the same thing
Sometimes I have to remind myself to breathe. Like, c'mon idiot, that's supposed to be an automatic function.
Wore a big black hat today and my tattoo artist told me I looked like I belonged in Children of the Corn. Fuck yeah.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, you just never know what the future will hold. Never limit your possibilities.
@DaniNeckDeep bro. There's no way you live in 2015 and have never once used that word.
Like the two days a year that people notice I have a Lightsaber on my arm. 
@MyGarages I hate you.
@MyGarages you never need a reason to watch Star Wars
Happy Revenge of the 5th!!!
Happy fucking birthday to the homie @DaveCTE !!
The only thing we can ever be truly certain of, is that we cannot be certain of what the future will hold.
I have been so anxious and stressed out lately! I need to sleep soon or I'm going to blow up!
It's seriously cool as fuck seeing my friends do such big things.
315 long motherfucking days, and then @AlieHouseOfGray is helping me absolutely ruin what is left of my liver.
Wearing Aladdin socks to the liquor store because fuck it.
Just saw the post pop punk kid of my life. Dude had a pizza face and a tattoo that said 'music' with a penny board next to it.
Twin brother and I hanging with our homie. 
May 4th-ing hard as fuck.
A true Slumdog Million tale: from slave to Darth Vader, ruler of the galaxy. #hope
Straight listening to Star Wars dubstep with the gang, the way it should be done.
May the Fourth be with you! @AndrewCTE where you at?! 
How I longboarded back to the apartment without falling asleep though I'll never know.
Just took the exam to end my second to last semester of college.
Did not sleep even a single wink last night. Going to be the most miserable little titty baby all day.
About to go take my final on negative sleep. Sick.
@AlieHouseOfGray -"she looks like Cruella Deville on acid." I'm fucking dead.
If @AlieHouseOfGray does what she said she's going to do... I will kiss her face. Fuuuck.
I love everything about touring and road tripping. Or a weird combination of both.
We may bicker and get mad at each other, but @Nadi_uh is my fucking rider. Yes biiitch!
Straight pulled a @AndrewCTE and @LouMiceliJr . Think I'm beating you guys in the dumb matching homie tattoo department now.
Im going to start eating better, and get back in the gym. I miss the shape I used to be in and I can't party for 10 more months.
I'm going to use this time of having to be sober, to get healthy and back in shape like I used to be.
Vibin' heavy to the Vteam right now.
It's the little things.
Still salty about that fight, not gunna lie.
No way Mayweather won that shit. Fuck outta here.
@AndrewCTE @Nadi_uh miss us yet?! Lmaoooo
Tom Brady is at the fight. baaaaaah!
Killin the game right now. 
I have to head to work at the bar and nowww my body decides it's ready for some sleep. I need to straighten up.
@BrendanBarone but no, really!
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh @AndrewCTE he already hates me for constantly ruining mortal combat
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh @AndrewCTE Andys going to get off stage and hate us!
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh @AndrewCTE I said, I said biiitch!
@CiBabs noooo! The same thing happened with the one I had in my arm!
Not a single one of us look amused, but I wanna go back. @Nadi_uh @BrendanBarone @CiBabs @Danny_Suede 
@Nadi_uh and I need to have our own tv show, all the adventures and shit we go on!
@Danny_Suede is that like the lady that came on the bus in Ybor and then got off raging because she wanted Haydens popcicle?!
I just need to move to LA.

<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Aye, I wanna be on whatever the creator of Courage the Cowardly Dog was on.
If you didn't know, the boy @GusthaMC of @Volumesband can spit too. Check out Yung Yogi. 
This last week has put me in a better mood than I've been in in a long time.
@CiBabs dude what happened?! I'm scared to get mine now!
I don't feel right man.
Matching tatts with twin tonight. I wasn't cut out for that shit!
Came to work and look what I found! @Volumesband @GusthaMC @AtTheBarr 
Nick just said my language was "course, brash, and atrocious" lmaooo
Sleep and food are apparently things my body doesn't think it needs anymore. Guys, I think I'm dying.
This was the first time I've ever hungout with @CrownTheEmpire not being able to drink, that shit suckeddd! Just wait fuckers!
March 14th, 2016, mark the motherfucking date! The first thing I'm doing is hoping on tour with my friends and obliterating my liver. Ayeee.
Someone please stop Ronnie Radke from coming on my Pandora when I'm concentrating on Call of Duty.
I need to fill out at least one arm or leg soon. Tired of every one of my friends beating me!
@DaveCTE how are you guys even alive?!
@AndrewCTE I am home dingus. You're lucky too, I'd hate to beat you up on your birthday.
@AndrewCTE that's amazing bro, proud of you!
The only downfall of seeing friends play so much is getting their songs stuck in my head. Let me start humming one more time...
@BaileyCr3go last night was that good huh?!
PSN needs to get its shit together so I can play vidja games. Apparently I need to get up on my Mortal Combat skills.
So mad I missed last night's festivities!
@shaunamustdie dude same
Going to watch Courage the Cowardly Dog since apparently I don't sleep or function like a normal human anymore.
Going on 5 days with only 3 hours of sleep between them. I'm so pissed about it because I'm home, but I'm not at all tired.
Happy birthday to the one and only @GusthaMC as well!!! Smoke some for me!
@AndrewCTE happy 21st birthday shithead! Sorry I couldn't be there, wear the clown nose and drink one for me!! 
I don't know when this happened. Or why I have a picture with you @BrendanBarone 
@CiBabs I'm listening to Thy Art and I remembered you saying you'd never seen them the other day! You need to!
@BennSuede straight caterpillars right now man!
It's a proven fact, I only look good at friend's shows. 
Not being able to drive for 4 more months sucks so much dick right now. I should be partying with the boys tonight for @AndrewCTE birthday!
Under eye bag game strong af.
@GusthaMC that's awesome! I'm trying to come out for his tonight!
@GusthaMC you and Andy have the same birthday?!
My sleep schedule is so filthy rn. What even is sleep.
@BennSuede @SamShapiroMedia Is that why they look so bad?!
@Chrisfotch for onceee. I feel the love:)
@SamShapiroMedia damnnn, I guess that means I did, stoked <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CrownTheEmpire are the biggest lot of assholes! But deep down they're the nicest guys. They're okay friends I guess <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@SamShapiroMedia oh and I hope I ruined all your footage the last few days by being in it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@SamShapiroMedia hahah no way dude, I'm used to all of them being assholes! I try to come out to at least one of their shows a tour
Killllin' the game rn.
@SamShapiroMedia see you around never!
Just realized @AndrewCTE was only olloted 15 minutes play time after last night's set, what the fuck happened @BennSuede ?!
Holy fuck. I finally sleep and it was 3 hours and now I have class. My body is going to shut down any minute.
Ya girl is on 43 hours of being awake. Just got home about to hit this coma!
Really wish I wasn't leaving the homies to head home. Had a great time as usual!
Already told you both, but @GusthaMC and @AtTheBarr you guys killed it again, glad I could see you guys the last few days!
I'll just leave this here. @BennSuede 
Literally wish everyone could see @BennSuede right now.
Just kidding, there's no chance of me taking a nap on this bus!
Never realized how fucking scary getting in a bus bunk is. Wtf.
The fucking things I hear from my friends on tour <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Pissed though, I've hardly slept all week, still have not gone to bed from last night, and I'm wide awake about to hit this drive.
Weird turn of events, we will be at the Ft. Lauderdale tonight! Stoked as fuck
I love the scene I'm in because we all wear as much black as possible everyday without looking like emo kids.
This mixtape bout to be that fire. <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@BrandonCTE you're the Front Porch Step of alcohol!!
Front Porch Step came on and I immediately thought of @BrandonCTE and @HaydenTree idc what you guys say!
I'm about to #mcm some food because ya girl is starving.
Contrary to popular believe, I don't get dudes like people think. It's been 7 months since I've so much as hugged a boy I liked.
Literally photo bombed every fan photo last night. Aye, you guys are welcome.
In between travels I'm finishing a 15 slide powerpoint about myself for class... I never realized how fucking boring I am.
Better put on another sick show in Lauderdale @GusthaMC !
Pretty sure the next few days are going to turn my blood to Monster because I know I won't be sleeping. Ever.
PSA: @brenttaddie is the biggest pain in my ass and I hate him! 
Sleep? I'm good, I got like two whole hours.
The homies in @Volumesband killed it last night and quite literally lit up the whole room. Stoked for Lauderdale! 
Oh fuck, looks like I'm spending another two days with the homies in @CrownTheEmpire
Goes to Bdubs and of all the drinks, @BrandonCTE gets a house margarita. Alright little bro.
Ybor City, I'm inside you.
Every other song on Pandora this morning has been Whitechapel, and I'm okay with this.
@HaydenTree is the kind of friend who just always makes my anxiety hurt!
@Eedzz @AlieHouseOfGray @ieatfrogs11 
@AlieHouseOfGray @Eedzz @ieatfrogs11 
I'm laying down to go to sleep and I hear @Nadi_uh go, "I wonder what guy she went home with tonight" # dead
Aye, Catdog just said "wash your tootsies"
Kill Confirmed until I feel like painting a mural on my face.
Stoked on hangs with the homies in @Volumesband and @CrownTheEmpire tomorrow.
Move it you stupid soot balls!
@rikaandthewolf Idc how old you are, being inconsiderate as fuqq. Finna dig off in a jit!
@rikaandthewolf no really, he doesn't understand how much he's fucking up rn.
Babysitting my friends kid, and he won't stop making sounds when I'm trying to watch Studio Ghibli.
Listening to Korn getting ready for work. :)
@DaniNeckDeep that's the first one I've ever come across without one! Bring yours silly goose
@DaniNeckDeep keepin it real, I need the mixtape props <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> are you to tell me your bangwagon isn't going to have a ps4?
@DaniNeckDeep ayeeee lemme get some recognition on the mixtape! Just make sure to get a shot that makes me look cool too haha
@DaniNeckDeep for sure man! There are like 4 or 5 fl dates this year and I should be at all of them again this year! I'll shoot you!
In case you guys didn't know, there is indeed a viper with a fucking spider for a tail.... nawh dude!
@DaniNeckDeep I'm not merching or doing photography for anyone this year, so I'll probably just be at all the FL dates
@DaniNeckDeep I mean, I might be nice and let you win bro! I just expect you to play Destiny by warped!
@DaniNeckDeep dudeee, get it! It's one of the only newer games I bother playing! Get it and play me fooool
@DaniNeckDeep not anymore. I've only been playing destiny and black ops online lately, getting it back soon though
@DaniNeckDeep has yours been laggy as shit? The last 2 days playing BO2 have been wrecked!
@DaniNeckDeep can we talk about PSN rn, christ!
I feel really bad because my snake just freaked out and slammed his head backwards against the tank, and I'm not sure why.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray thank god
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray do us all a favor.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray fucking make me! All the way from whatever state you're in.

@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray boo hoo. My feelings. Ouch.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray you're making my head hurt, your mindset is amazing.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray I'm stuck with allie again, but I think I'm capable without you guys.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray yeah, classic marisa needing dingus advice to turn her life around. Gee willikers, thanks.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray just needed to be steered in the right direction is all.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray yeah dude, I feel you. Spread pessimism, not herpes. Got it.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray oh gotcha. I'll be sure to do so.
@AlieHouseOfGray @ieatfrogs11 ha. I just noticed how truly correct his name is. Bahhh.
@AlieHouseOfGray @ieatfrogs11 with what, allll the weiner thrown my way?
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray I'm opting out of the group.
@AlieHouseOfGray @ieatfrogs11 I'm more than okay staying away from you both
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray you guys make me sick. You're both sooo nice.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray coming from one who dated me and one who lived with me. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray do it then. I'll punch you right in the wrist.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray lmaooo true. Got me real good.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray Fite me.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray I'll get over it eventually.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray sweet spelling. Too jelly.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray that's literally want I'm saying. All hail idiot boy coming home.
@ieatfrogs11 @AlieHouseOfGray nope, I wants those fucks off my case. Miss you too.
Stoked for @ieatfrogs11 to come home so all my friends will leave me alone and worry about fuckboy. (@AlieHouseOfGray)
Allie made me change out of gym shorts and flip flops to go to lunch. Bitch.
I'm not picky, but I like combat boots, skinny jeans, ignorant tshirts, face dermals, plugs, and top knots. <OK HAND SIGN>
Watching Ponyo, because this story makes more sense than anything going on.
@erock352 no one said any of those things eric. Come on.
When you think you can trust someone to vent to, and they run and squeal to anyone with ears. Ask me again why I trust no one.
Took a poop in @AlieHouseOfGray bathroom while she was asleep. 
Just woke up out of my sleep because one of Allie's neighbors sounds like my mom.
Nick- "I have to be up at 9 tomorrow"
Me- "what time do you work?"
Nick- "9"
... oh,  okay lol
@mike_von_doom dear god
@monstredeyuki I live in the shores. But I might head to allies soon
@monstredeyuki pleaseeee!
His word comprehension is going too, time for hospice @erock352 
I just wanna watch Ponyo dude. Why don't I own an studio ghibli movies?! Ugh.
I'm really hungry and haven't eaten in 2 days. But I have no motivation and I know my mom will just tell me to find something to eat.
@joshua_gant okay okay, i'll let you have that. it's still a mustang though!
I want to go to Spooky so bad but I can't drive, and idk anyone going. Fuck.
I swim in the water that's breaking your levy. The way that you left me is alright, it's alright.
@aaronmatts When are you coming back here dingus?!
@christoferjs @joshua_gant no, I just know ford is garbage, and I wouldnt drop that kind of money on 4 cylinders!
@joshua_gant please not a mustang. No.
@erock352 pretty much
I guess I'll watch Courage the Cowardly Dog until I can force myself back to sleep.
I've been asleep since 2 yesterday afternoon. 19 hours. Thank you depression.
Stoked to see the homies in @Volumesband again this weekend! I promise not to lose my phone so @AtTheBarr can't take selfies like last tour!
It's not good to speak ill of the dead, but seriously, that cop was a terrible fucking person. I knew it could get worse.
Just got a letter saying my license is suspended indefinitely. Excuse me while I fucking hang myself.
@erock352 well me and him are still cool so shut it.
@erock352 exactly. I can't stop thinking there's one near me now.
Just because my friends don't like someone, doesn't mean I don't either. I am my own judge of character.
@erock352 It was the literal worst dream ever. I kid you not when I say I woke up with a nosebleed I was freaking out in the dream so bad.
@anglesososo oooh okay. im hanging with them and cte at the tampa one then I think
@anglesososo I thought it was sunday?
@sl4mmy I can't find it :/
Like, I had a dream a banana spider was under my shirt poking its leg through... I was so scared I woke up with a nosebleed.
If my stepdads goal was for me to have nightmares when he said a big spider ran in my room, he succeeded.
@erock352 no, it's because idk what they're talking about.
I appreciate the concern, but whoever is blowing up my tumblr about my ex is sadly mistaken because idgaf?
So stoked for this weekend. I need this so much.
Watching Miami Ink because Ami James can get the bidness.
@rikaandthewolf mariserpisser
Laughing my mother fucking ass off. I will try my dangest. 
My snake is getting so big. I love my boy. :')
Just woke up from a nap, and realized I still haven't heard from any of my friends. Lmaoooo Illuminati documentaries it is.
Psychosocial.
About to rage so hard. I keep getting thrown off the servers and getting put on probation for it. Brooklk.
Every time I look like a bum playing video games I think of @jyemenzies reminding me I should've been a boy ;p
@Mickeyplease @iammichaelowens living in the past, the future is now; and the future is wax, gel, pomade, and powder
I've been eating frozen Go-Gurts all day like there was heroin in em.
What are lungs? 
Now the matches are lagging like a motherfucker. Get your shit together while I'm in the shower PSN.
@mikaylax I'm pretty sure she made me gay too after that PSA video she made.
Black Ops 2 online is insanely sped up and there are enemy dogs everywhere. Wtf is going on rn?
@MyGarages damn, got my ass. #salty
#kyliejennerchallenge results! Jk, I over drew my lips because I'm not mentally challenged. 
@MyGarages man, you're right. I should just invite him to play vidja games with me. #rudebitch
You numb nuts know you can just over draw your lips with liner and then fill them in right? #kyliejennerchallenge
For fucks sake, why is the  #kyliejennerchallenge a thing? You deserve those hideous mouth bruises you brainless drones.
@MyGarages much like everyone else, Closy could just come out and say it. #StopTheLies2015
@MyGarages or maybe Closy is altering reality forcing me to either challenge the essence of time or essentially go mad. #closetdemonprobs
@MyGarages I have no idea. But I'm lost following their rules of time and space. #notesnotincluded
@MyGarages or that the lapse between 680937 minutes and 1470 can feel like mere moments. #notestaken
Just spoke with an amazingly talented and artistic taxidermist. She's got connects with snake breeders, and I'm excited to buy from her.
@MyGarages dude, it did another one this morning, I had to take a 2 hour nap. Only 683094 minutes.
I miss my Skrilla Killa jerk Russian homie @markoilo ♡
@erock352 well thank god for that...
@erock352 maybe so
Damn right she made bacon burgers instead. Don't fuck with me when I'm slaying Fallen.
@erock352 negative
@erock352 I don't like beans or rice.
@erock352 there's a reason I don't like Spanish food.
@erock352 nawh man.
@Jijit27 you would be the one person to try to make it something else!
@Jijit27 I meant rice dammit
Moms making fish, rish, beans, and greens for dinner... 4 things I don't fucking eat?
@juliaeliseberry tell mom I said hi and I love her!
The voice of Chucky is going to be at Spooky Empire.... in.
PSN is testing my nerves atm.

I feel bad for whoever marries @juliaeliseberry and I because our houses will be filled with horror memorabilia and preserved animals. \m/
Just found some fucking dope taxidermy bird skull rings.
In case anyone thought I was kidding. 
Home from class. Here I come Destiny, bye world.
@shaunamustdie pretty please.
@shaunamustdie that's about how I feel rn tbh! Ps, I miss you.
@shaunamustdie you're telling me! It's been Chester And Rikki across 3 years for weeks now.
Sometimes people pick sides without realizing it. It didn't have to be done, and it's really a shame it was.
Going to class and then spending the day with my closet demon. He's always there for me:)
My TimeHop is not only showing me when Chester fucked me over a year ago, but three years ago as well rn.
Forgot I had class tomorrow. It'll cut into my gaming time but that's ight.
@AndrewCTE isn't that french toast though man?
@erock352 I had no desire to go. Not exactly like I was invited either.
There are a lot of things I would like to tweet about right now, but I won't bother. Just know I'm upset and disappointed.
Must. Conserve. @juliaeliseberry #SaveTheKnot
@juliaeliseberry -"slip into something comfortable, like a coma" *gecko face*
My favorite thing about @MyGarages telling a story is that if he fumbles on a word he just says "words" instead.
I wish I didn't keep track of things so well. Then maybe I wouldn't be so bitter and jaded.
@MyGarages just made me feel like shit, he compared me putting Dalí back in his tank to blue balls!
@Jijit27 I see Rob all the time cause I has his voodoo doll:)
@Jijit27 
Mom won't take me to get a Monster so I'm just going to throw a giant temper tantrum.
@juliaeliseberry not as much as I need you rn
To lay here listening to music, play Destiny, or do something productive?
@rikaandthewolf I just realized I wasn't following you and then I was like omg, Princess Mononoke is on my twitter!
I hate that I can't drive for 5 more months. I'm convinced everyone's going to forget about me because they're always together and I'm not.
@rikaandthewolf is the real life Mononoke man. That's awesome dude, hope you're doing good!
Is a Manhattan Roll so much to ask for rn?
This headache is for the birds.
Me- "when are you ever going to wear fake eyelashes?" Mom- "idk, the bedroom or something?" *kills myself*
@AlieHouseOfGray you're not a good person for this...
Fixed the error on my PS3, so I'm going to play Destiny just to spite @AlieHouseOfGray
@Eedzz I will notttttt. Suck my asssss.
I hate my friends. No exceptions.
@Nadi_uh yelling at our security guards last night was hilarious! "Stop being in love with my best friend, all of you! Just stop!"
@juliaeliseberry great, now I have to watch The Devils Rejects. Thanks.
I don't know why my mother bothers buying makeup brushes... or makeup, because I just steal it.
I don't fancy La Dispute, but their song King Park gets me every time. #CanIStillGetIntoHeavenIfIKillMyself
@erock352 @Eedzz a part of me just died.
Looking at her brother, idk how Miley can have the nerve to call herself "tatted up" in a song.
Every time Dalí yawns and looks me in the eye, I feel like he's saying "just wait till I'm bigger bitch"
Thank god my heavily tattooed female cousin is in town so I won't be alone at the family party
Aiden/AFI radio on Pandora atm. #noshame
@erock352 I hate you.  Shut up.
@erock352 a little harsh, but that's how much I'm willing to give for some.
Two of my security guards are in love with me and I think it's hilarious.
If you go to a bar, don't try to pick up someone who works there. We don't want to go on a date with you because you bought alcohol from us.
I would give a baby a swift kick to the nuts for some ihop rn.
No one is as impressed with you as you are.
I wish I would've been born in Russia so I could've been a ballerina.
@juliaeliseberry I'll bet you did satan, I'll bet you did.
@juliaeliseberry but that was the worst circle of hell.
@AlieHouseOfGray and @juliaeliseberry are never fucking allowed to hang with my mom again. Mark my goddamn words.
Hahahaha of course my color would be called when I have to go to the Dr with my mom.
#ShaunaRayIsBae @shaunamustdie
Religion has turned into a scapegoat. People don't want to admit their external locusts of control, so they speak of 'God's plan'.
Just remembered I have to get up early to go with mom to get her pace maker checked. Bahhhh with the morning time.
The worst part about all of this, shouldn't be but is, is that I can't get any tattoos for at least a year.
Oh and huge shout out to @AlieHouseOfGray for the donation to the Fix Marisa's Dirtbag Lifestyle fund.
@Eedzz @AlieHouseOfGray the truest representation of me.
@Eedzz bruh, same.
Saw two white girls with thot buns today.... what is going on? That is not okay.
@Eedzz I miss my Petunia Rose.
Me- "that class gave me a damn headache" mom-"at least you got something out of it"
The impact panel shed a lot of light. But also showed me why I'm glad I'm not religious.
@juliaeliseberry love you too bae.
Wearing a dinosaur shirt thinking of @juliaeliseberry :)
I get depressed every time Brand New comes on.
@MyGarages meeeee
I just want to sell out my funeral.
Moms treating me like a fucking slave since I'm not working. And she won't take me anywhere. This is great. :)
Everyone just leave me alone. Sorry I posted any thoughts or reminders i'm alive.
@erock352 I post literally almost everyday if anyone wants to hangout.
Most of the time, I really wish I had the nerve to give myself eternal freedom. But i'm much too weak to end my own suffering.
@erock352 I know.
@mike_von_doom @erock352 really cool use of screenshot. How is that being hipster exactly? I was saying I didnt know they were still around.
@mike_von_doom @erock352 but we're not wrong?
All of my leg tattoos couldn't be more relevant to my life. Seriously. I didn't get them for nothing, or to look cool. They're me.
Don't tell me that I'll be fine, I'm so sick of hoping you're right.
I wonder if I got a hookah if my friends would actually come hangout with me? Playing Katarmi and listening to Spotify alone it is.
@erock352 and their trendy, overpriced foods.
@erock352 I just don't understand people who feel the opposite
Pop Punk is a great and blossoming genre, but some of it is just really fucking bad.
It's weird seeing all my friends listening to Defeater... like, I'm still jamming their demo they gave me at Warped '08.
@juliaeliseberry don't talk to me
Moe's &gt; Chipotle or piss off.
The only thing that sucks about being home is that my parents don't care if I'm hungry and won't take me anywhere.
@MyGarages -"when is the last time anyone even lied. No one does that anyone, this is 2015" lmaooo #StopTheLies2015
Just noticed this screenshot of how @Chrisfotch and I communicate. Accurate representation. 
@Chrisfotch you're flattered for nothing bae, I haven't been on in a few days, and I liked that you were so lonely.
More so than not being able to drive or do anything for myself, I HATE that I can't buy all the horror collectibles I want.
@juliaeliseberry I fucking hate you. Halloween is my favorite series.
I really want to go home but I can't get ahold of my mom. Of course.
Huge thank you to @sl4mmy for cutting and dying my hair yesterday:)
Here's to hoping I don't fall off the kayak and drown or something.
Don't paint me black when I used to be golden.
Chunk playing on the Neck Deep station? This is confusing.
It's been a few hours since I've said this... I hate Chris Fotch. With everything in me. That is all.
I can't stress this enough, please be careful guys. We are not invincible, so don't do stupid, wreckless shit.
I hate myself so much for not owning any Studio Ghibli movies. Like, this is a serious problem.
@Eedzz I literally cried! oleee drugged up Edonia!
@Eedzz your snaps fucking killed me! Hope you're okayyyyy.
If you don't think Aiden has the best Pandora/Spotify station, you're wrong.
@sl4mmy I tweeted the same thing the other day!
Laughed so hard watching my mom try to eat sushi for the first time that I spit rice everywhere. #noshame
Mom and I are going to sushi bistro if anyone wants to meet us.
I feel sick to my stomach because I'm so upset right now. Quite literally locked myself in my room so I can cry undisturbed all day.
@erock352 omg fucking stopppp!
@erock352 that's what I thought too, but I guess not
Parents would rather tell me how fat I am now than take me to the gym. Cool. Didn't hate myself enough yet.
@erock352 that's what I'm saying. I was like bitch you a lie
Wearing the bucket hat I stole from @juliaeliseberry and my teacher called me out for being fashionable... aye.
This lying ass broad in my class just said she's never seen a single Disney movie. Get the fuck out of here.
Pretty sure State Troopers are taking over during Officer Forsythes funeral because they're everywhere rn. It's making me itchy.
@joshuawoodard  you should not be playing on the AFI Pandora station rn, stahp!
This rapper performing with FOB... I've understand about 1% of the words he's said. #illuminati #MTVMovieAwards
Is everyone in FOB blonde now? That pesky illuminati and their fashion forward rules.
@shaunamustdie everyone keeps saying that but ughhhh!
@shaunamustdie I really, really need it to come out soon! I don't think anyone else understands!
Slept until 3 this afternoon, and I'm exhausted again already. Fuck it, not like I have things to do.
Jurassic World... hurry up and come out.
Pretty much sums up me and @Chrisfotch friendship. I'd hate him more if he lived any closer. 
My TimeHop everyday is nothing but pictures of my cat. I miss my Moose so much. :(
@Jijit27 @tylerdennen just kiss him already Alex.
Can't decide what to watch so I guess I'll listen to my favorite goofball @JoeyITO sing stuff.
@erock352 I could not agree with you more. I used to watch it like everyday!
@erock352 I'm so stoked this is on netflix! I used to own it but someone stole it from me
Someone just asked me if I was married.... to what? One of my mom's chihuahuas?
Fuck! Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood is on netflix... goodbye.
3 years ago ya girl was naked. I had like 2 tiny tattoos. 
I can't remember the last time I liked a guy in my own state, let alone my own city.
Mom- "look what she's wearing now besides not much. Slut. Go douche first" Lmao done.
Just woke up. Bed time yet?
@erock352 thank god for my regulars
The absolute only good thing about today was that I made $140 in tips and my sales were only $120.
Of course there was a shooting tonight at that party by my house. It just wouldn't be a Shores party without a fucking shooting.
I'm not one for crosses, but in honor of his life, I'm wearing a cross shirt and a rosary he gave me a million years ago.
@erock352 yeah, I know.
@erock352 I was, but the girl who was supposed to cover me flaked, so now I have to go in. :(
Just woke up from a nap to get ready for work.... depressed, headache, and sick to my stomach.
It's also pretty funny that I nicknamed Walt "Pop" when we were dating, and even our teachers ended up calling him that. ♡
It did make me laugh though that the silly poster I made him to put in his dorm was inside the pamphlet. Rest easy now Pop.
I think this is supposed to make it real, but it still doesn't feel that way. 
Just carried out flowers to lay my first love, and close friend to rest. You were so special and I miss you so much.
Stepdad- "you're dressed like you're going to a funeral" me- "I am." Him- "oh, well okay."
Please guys, be careful. I can't handle losing anyone else close to me.
Literally throwing up because I'm going to a funeral for someone I really care about and I probably have to sit alone with social anxiety.
@juliaeliseberry I hate you.
@juliaeliseberry poor Dalí
Put on the bucket hat I stole from @juliaeliseberry to go poop. :)
Made next to nothing today. I guess it's to match how I'll feel tomorrow.
@juliaeliseberry *hears loud noise* Maaaaam?!
Hope I make a lot of money tonight because I'm taking tomorrow night off since I know I'll be a wreck after the funeral.
@erock352 make me.
Honestly, my "base face" takes just as long as any look I do. That's so sad.
I always get superrrr bored of doing my makeup about a quarter of the way through. Why couldn't I have just been born pretty?
Babe no! No babe! Babe! Baaaaaaaaabe! *need to watch Hot Rod soon*
Just saw a like 9 year old girl with a crop top and high waisted shorts with her asshole falling out. Sweet.
Julias mom- "I caught you this delicious bass... that's the meaning of life"
Just passed a sheriff who was parked in the turning lane with his lights on to text... way to go Marion County.
@erock352 stahppp, you're probably right.
Sitting at home watching Bob's Burgers all day. And maybe a spoopy movie here and there.
Dalí is so pissed that I had to put him back like 2 hours ago, that he has not broken his stare from me.
Think I just convinced mom to pay to get my hair bleached and dyed silver. Fwm.
@erock352 I uh, don't know what you mean.
@erock352 he's a great guy. Let me tell you.
@erock352 bothhhh
@juliaeliseberry thanks bee ♡
@juliaeliseberry apparently not. Apparently I'm too fat now to be pretty.
Stepdad just told me that I'm getting fat and gross and that I'll never find a guy now. Have I mentioned I fucking hate him.
My stepdad is a grumpy piece of shit. Today is the day I will fucking swing. Leave me the fuck alone asshole.
@erock352 I beg to differ.
@erock352 I really appreciate it. I'm just taking it pretty hard.
@erock352 thank you:/
I am not fucking okay right now. Seeing someone so important to me in a coffin. I'm not ready for the funeral, I'm not ready for goodbye.
Seeing such a wonderful human being laying there so still and lifeless in a coffin hit me a lot harder than I thought it would.
His mom hugged me and told me everything will be okay and I shouldn't cry anymore. This is real.
Just said goodbye to Walter. It did not feel good to see him laying there with his head stitched up.
Everyone take a second and go listen to my new friends Icarus the Owl! They're awesome people, and play some great music!
@erock352 pretty much.
Johnny Cash and Howlin' Wolf kind of day.
Katamari Forever got my nerves through the ceiling.
Pretty sure the only way I know how to make friends is to be a sarcastic prick and hope they go along with it.
@Eedzz surrendered her sweet tea at Taco Bell so that our total would be $6.66 #metal
@MyGarages so sir, I really appreciate it though
@erock352 yeah, they're a lot like bengals. They get pretty big too and look like little leopards
@erock352 I want a bengal or a Maine coon for the same reason
Mom just bet me a cookie that I wouldn't go to daytona to slap her.
So, I really need to go home and no one's answering me.
I want a fucking Bambino Cat! It's a cross between a Sphinx Cat and a Munchkin Cat. Bahhhhhhh.
@juliaeliseberry I watched that episode yesterday and thought of you!
@juliaeliseberry I missa you face.
@erock352 well duhhh.
@erock352 I thought about it.
Can I just be in bed watching studio ghibli and eating sushi?
Gross. I get to class and there's like 30 cops outside my building just hanging out.
'Mad World' wasn't just written for fun.
If you don't know what happened and you weren't there, don't tell me the cop was just doing his fucking job, falsifying a report is not.
Went from fine to pissed the fuck off in a quarter of a second. You can't tell me the officer didn't lie on my report, or justify it.
Calum just picked me up so I guessss I'm stuck with them again.
Familys gone for a few days and I'm trapped at the house <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><PISTOL>
@Nadi_uh lmaoooo gotta keep the lot lizards happy
Can I just meet a decent guy with tattoos and a top knot? No? Cool.
Dalí finally shed. <SNAKE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Resorted to cleaning my room.
@monstredeyuki @erock352 I can't think of a single question that needs to be asked.
@erock352 @monstredeyuki fact. Period.
Am I getting sick? FUCKING SHOOT ME.
@BrandonCTE at least you replaced the meth head one!
@monstredeyuki @erock352 the argument was about archer being better than bobs burgers, and I disagree!
Wearing Walter's football sweats to bed. I can't believe I have to say goodbye to him this weekend.
Ju st asked Ferris Wheel to stop breathing so I could hear the movie... I think he's done with me
Forcing Ferris to watch Sweeney Todd while I obnoxiously sing along.
Karma is a real fucking bitch but she is alive and well.
Ferris -"Archer was made for guys. You have a coochie down there so you wouldn't get it"
I'm starving and I literally can't afford to eat. And I'm more than likely losing my car soon. I just want to crawl in a hole.
I just want to cry and eat sushi.
About to meet my PO for the first time. Ehhh.
@AnthonyJamessss ewww.
Barely slept a wink all night.
@Chrisfotch exactly. Maybe that's how he like praises or whatever you call it.
@Chrisfotch let that man live his life.
As much as I hate to admit it, I really love and appreciate @Chrisfotch , even though he's across the country from me.
I'm not okay.
@erock352 absolutely. #ProtectTheKnot
@erock352 no they dont. You're blind, you don't even know what you're saying.
@erock352 knock it the fuck off.
I never see my dog so if my mom gets infront of him as I'm about to take a picture again I'm going to break her knees.
There's a special place in hell for people who smoke cigarettes in a car without at least having the windows down.
My mom just ran two stop signs, I'm about to fucking scream. I need to go home immediately.
Nature's amazing. When did natural selection stop being a thing?
About just punched my stepdad in the hospital because he wouldnt stop hitting my nose. I have 3 piercings fuckboy Im too tired for this shit
My heart is so heavy. I loved that kid with everything in me. It just doesn't feel right that he's gone.
I hate holidays because I'm obligated to do shit with people. Like, I just want to go home and sleep.
Stepbrother -"omg I thought that was Hitler. Like I'm not lying, rose from the dead"
Mom- "hold your chins up marisa, be proud." Just kill me.
Two other young people walked in Cracker Barrel wearing all black, success. #strengthinnumbers
My patience is fleeting.
@erock352 well of course not. Just especially today.
Mouth noises make me sick to my fucking stomach. Shits gross af. I'm about to puke stoppp.
@erock352 I felt it appropriate
My mom wants to hang with me and my friends so she can try hookah. Christ.
Family comes to pick me up for Easter lunch wearing eerie shades of pastels, and I'm wearing all black. What's up fam.
Nadia and I just saw a guy speed, hop a curb, and then veer three lanes of traffic... but we got DUIs? Okay.
@Nadi_uh -"bullshit, you just want to face fuck me"
The two most genuinely kindhearted people I've ever met died at ages 15 and 21. Both are too fucking young.
I miss this goofball so much more than I can explain. He can't be gone, it's not fair. You'll always be in my heart.♡ 
Been listening to blues and balling my eyes out all morning.
I cannot believe you're really gone Pop. I hope you're still cracking jokes up there. ♡♡♡ 
Mom-"you can have these new underwear I got. They just don't seem wide enough to cover things... like I don't want my Pikachu hanging out"
And a slampig will oink.
Can't sleep. I can't stop thinking about Walt Dean being gone. Why did you have to go and do something so stupid? Ugh. :'(
About to head into work... but this all still doesn't seem real. It just can't be. Seeing how many people are hurt makes me smile though.
You were loved by all, and will be missed by all. I can't believe such a funny and caring soul is gone. Rest easy Walter Devin O'Neal. ♡
They've released his name. I still don't believe this is real.
I've already lost my job and my freedom, and now someone near and dear to me who was my first everything. Man.
I refuse to believe he's gone. This was so unlike him. I'm in so much shock. 
Too many beautiful, undeserving lives are taken way too soon over a night out. Not drinking again. Rip. ♡
This isn't real. It can't be.
Just got a phone call that my ex died in a drunk driving accident last night and he was found in a lake. I'm not okay.
Mom-"I need to go brush my teeth. I got heavy sweaters on and it's summertime." What the actual fuck mom!
Watching the original Japanese Grudge.
@juliaeliseberry she's insane, I love my momma!
Mom- "invite him over to watch TV in your bed and see what happens... ya know, canoodling"
Mom-"invite him over for dinner" me-"do you like hotdogs in your mac and cheese or nah?"
Got called to probation to get tested... and they're fucking closed for Good Friday. Way to go Marion County.
@erock352 idk. They're interesting.
Watching a documentary called I Escaped a Cult... I might throw up. Religion is gross, in its extreme forms at least.
@littleh0tmess oh thank goodness, I think I stopped breathing for a moment!!
@littleh0tmess stoooop.
Pentecostal church camp documentaries make me sick. <WEDDING><CHURCH>️<FIRE><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><SKULL><PILE OF POO>
Why do people have to be cunty assholes when you ask a simple straight forward question?
So, as soon as I can afford it, I'm doing the Miley Cyrus cut. Shaving this shit offff.
@erock352 I'm uglyyyy!
@erock352 lmao it looks just like you!
An elderly woman just told me tattoos were cool, then proceeded to ask what my mother thought of them and what I'll do when I get married.
Once upon a time there was an ugly barnacle. And it was so ugly that everyone died. The end. Plot twist, I'm the ugly barnacle.
I'm so ugly, and julia always captures it. Dammmit.
@juliaeliseberry is about to look like Slim Shady with a top knot... and I'm stoked af.
@juliaeliseberry -"I'm going to tell your mom I'm going to eat ice cubes, and a cheese cube when I feel like I'm going to faint."
Why are there so many shows about little people being friends with other little people?
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry genuinely smile with excitement? No.
@juliaeliseberry I can't wait to conserve you
@juliaeliseberry uh make me?
Realization of the day: I'm not pretty enough to be hanging out with @juliaeliseberry
Must. Have. Coffee. Soon. <HOT BEVERAGE>️
Listening to Howlin' Wolf while I attempt to make my face not look like a homeless pre-adolescent boy.
The Devil's Rejects is on netflix?! It's the little things that make me happy, like not having to get up to put in my favorite slasher flick
@juliaeliseberry picks up Illegal Length Mascara, "you can't use this or you'll go back to jail"
@erock352 @Eedzz consider yourself lucky
@erock352 @Eedzz teeth, wings, scales... all depends really. I think.
@erock352 @Eedzz no no, I mean apart from our own and eachothers
@erock352 @Eedzz and neither of us have seen a weiner in 7 months.
Henna N' Placenta is the best thing that's ever happened to my hair.
@erock352 I knew I liked you
@erock352 I already am! Oh the proud, joyous feelings I have rn!
To be my friend, you have to be able to transition between grind metal, pop punk, and hill country blues... with ease.
I fuck with NYX Cosmetics so heavy. That shits coral.
@Eedzz omfg, cargo shorts and tourist sandals! I'm dead! #proudlesbianmoms
@Eedzz right before our very eyes! #proudlesbianmoms
@Eedzz I'm so excited!!
@erock352 I have never been so happy with you in my life! Now everyone knows your real name :')))))
@erock352 it does, proud of you Grand PaPaw Muta.
@Jijit27 @erock352 @juliaeliseberry dammmmit alex. Is your pussy and penis on my screen right now?!
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry @Jijit27 please and thank you
Goddammit I hate my friends. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ @juliaeliseberry @erock352 @Jijit27
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry @Jijit27 your retweets are turned off buddy
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry @Jijit27 I wish I could retweet that eric!
@juliaeliseberry @Jijit27 @erock352 I can't even imagine how this looks to the outside world.
@Jijit27 dammit alex!
Came home to my big boy in pre shed :)
@erock352 @Jijit27 @juliaeliseberry first date feels
@Jijit27 @erock352 @juliaeliseberry ewwwww! Stop!
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry you guys are making me nauseous
@erock352 @juliaeliseberry stahppp ew! EW!
Shout out to Zach for getting his meal free from our gay waiter! Probably because he came in with 4 girls who look like lesbians. Lmao
@juliaeliseberry -"they look like they rub cheeseburgers on eachother when they have sex... SQUIRT THE KETCHUP"
You've successfully made me lose friends, or make the ones I still have feel weird towards me. I hope you feel really good about yourself.
Turning my phone off again before I kill myself.
Calum- "always remember, you can't spell happiness without penis."
@shaunamustdie literally slays me. #rekt
@erock352 you shut your mouth Muta.
@AlieHouseOfGray  on cheap toilet paper, "you just have to use more so your finger doesn't pop through and finger you in the asshole."
@AlieHouseOfGray just April Fools'd me by saying I had to spend another night... that's not a joke that's a fucking nightmare.
@AlieHouseOfGray just told me if she was a man she would beat the shit out of me, drag me around my hair, and pay me to go to the gym.
Everything down to my bra, panties, and soul is black.
I'm going to kill myself if one more person tells me the way I feel is wrong.
I know I pretend like I am, but I am not okay.
If I could catch just one single goddamn break, that would be spectacular.
@MyGarages -"that's quaint as fuck."
@juliaeliseberry ah despair. I hate myself.
@AlieHouseOfGray put her foot on my knee at breakfast and then winked at me... I feel sick.
@juliaeliseberry this could be a horror movie.
I could fucking ruin you if I cared enough to do so. Just remember that while you think there's still a high horse under you.
Every time I post a status on facebook, a fight breaks out. Goodnight phone.
@juliaeliseberry -"going to take a quick shower"... 20 minutes later I'm about to pee in her bed.
@juliaeliseberry bet that... we'll see. But could it survive the tobacco fields?
@juliaeliseberry damn money, tweetin in the shower.
Hey, you guys remember when @juliaeliseberry had an instagram? #BlackLivesMatter
Of all the feuds I've been in, I've never been so appalled or disgusted with someone. Your true colors are hideous and fading fast.
@ocalafloriduh I told you I would be civil so I could hang with my friends, and I got thrown to the kids table?
@ocalafloriduh coming from the guy who wouldn't even let me sit at the same table? Way to be mature and civil.
Staying the night with @juliaeliseberry and shutting my phone off. Peace out everyone.
At least I have real friends that sat at the table with me.
You just proved you're a piece of shit who's incapable of being a civil and mature adult even for the sake of your friends. I'm disgusted.
"I am but a human, and I can only take so much", those words will be engraved on my headstone soon enough.
For everyone who doesn't like me, I promise you will never dislike me as much as I hate myself.
Once I go home, I plan to be alone at my house without my phone on. I can't handle anything else.
Do me a favor and get all the way the fuck out of here.
Hey bro, you can't ban me from a public place with my friends. Put my dick in your mouth.
Just realized Miley's little sister Noah did the voice for Ponyo... okay homie.
Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo fishy by the seaaaa.
#StopIggy2015
"white people better be glad all we want is equality and not revenge." Shut the fuck up. I'm literally sick to my stomach rn.
You're disgusting. Your whole tumblr is nothing but bashing white people for being white. Fuck off, you're what's wrong with this country.
Me- "Howl's Moving Castle" 
Calum- "Hank's Spinning Fort" 
Me- "Howard's Twirling Shack" 
Calum- "Han's Jumping Casa"
- my friends a dingus
Just jumped a fence and long boarded to class... it's too early for this shit.
Whoever created cursive was high as fuck. Like, "bro, we should like, try to write but like, make all the letters connect, you know?"
I would much rather just be friends with you on instagram because that way I don't have to hear you talk.
@Jijit27 @erock352 I miss you awex!
Guys, when I was born, @erock352 was already 15 years old... let that sink in.
I could absolutely not ever date someone that was allergic to cats. Ever.
Come onnnn. I cannot handle being around humans any longer.
Zack is so filled with useless knowledge, he's like a human snapple bottle.
Zack- "it's showing the kids now that they're punks and have stds."
In an awful mood. And now I'm stuck in a house full of people getting shit faced when I can't drink. Someone please just kill me.
Man, I'm just a terrible person and friend. Shutting my phone off, peace everyone.
Sometimes I'm really not sure why I bother waking up. Sorry about that, going back to bed.
I just want ihop tbh.
Work was cool tonight, had a lot of legit people come hangout with me. And I threw ice at my friends all night.
@erock352 -"I can't put music on my phone when it's full of naked pictures."
@erock352 I really appreciate it man.
@erock352 thank you grand pa paw. Ferris is coming to get me, I'm just not sure how I'm getting home.
@Chrisfotch christ. Lmao your mom is going to be stoked.
@erock352 it would be on the side if anything. I'll show you sometime
I need a ride to work tonight. Ugh.
@Chrisfotch all for me and the kids
Honestly might dread my hair up once it's gray and black.
@erock352 one day!
My heart is turning fucking black!
The bark of Heen from Howl's Moving Castle sounds like a 90 year old with emphysema and a smokers cough.
Fucking christ yes Sushi Bistro is open till 10:30. Praise.
I hate having tattoo artists for friends because I'm constantly getting threatened to have my face tattooed.
@Jijit27 no way man
@Jijit27 stahpppp.
@Jijit27 I forgot it even existed.
@Jijit27 nawh dude, he's talking about fucking honeycomb.
Am I the only one who can't tell Kendall and Kylie apart?
My bar back won't stop texting me about breakfast cereals.
I'm laughing so hard rn. You're a complete joke. Please open your eyes and evaluate your life.
Give me a fucking break.
I literally do not give a fuck how anyone feels about me. I have enough going on to worry about silly childish feelings.
I have no respect for you as a friend or as a person. The way you treat people is appalling. You're absolutely no better than anyone.
It makes me mad that at the end of the Cat Returns, Haru doesn't at least pet Muta when she passes him at the crossroads.
I hate when @Chrisfotch fills my feed with hockey shit. Get a job ya bum.
Anyone wanna do a photo shoot soon? No? Yeah me either.
In other news, watching the Cat Returns until I fall back asleep.
100% fighting @aaronmatts the next time he's anywhere near me in the states!
100000% percent done. I am thoroughly disgusted with humans and their nature. Please don't expect to hear from me.
@erock352 shut up.
All my friends, male and female, are really attractive. It's cool, but sucks at the same time.
But I refuse to tag him because I actually really hate him.
Christopher Fotch is the best and worst baest of best friends.
Just gave my mom's chihuahuas spaghetti, whoops.
@MyGarages you got it! That stuffs so old. I think I'm going to start a new art project
Even my snake doesn't wanna fuck with me right now. I don't even blame you Dalí.
@MyGarages it probably is honestly. But it was very nice meeting you as well, and thank you again.
Literally have not seen a single living soul all day. And I'm drowning in laundry. I'm cool as fuck.
@Jijit27 lmaoooooo.
@Jijit27 because I've never had to ask you for anything since all this happened.
Poppy Hill got me feeling dirty.
There's nothing cuter than a heavily tattooed couple.
@Jijit27 it's true though.
@erock352 I'm not quite sure id be missed too much. People could hangout at my house but I know no one will.
@erock352 well its true.
@littleh0tmess excellent!
Anyone wanna come hangout at my house? No? Okay, Ponyo and homework alone it is.
@littleh0tmess omg was it me?!
Probably won't be around too much anymore because I'm tired of burdening people and I've been spending way too much money.
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, fishy in the sea.
Ya girl is starving to fucking death.
Why Ponyo gotta turn back into a feesh though?
Can't remember the last time I smiled. It's cool though, shit gives you wrinkles anyway.
@Eedzz @juliaeliseberry @AlieHouseOfGray wait until you idiots see this epic ass back piece I'm about to sketch up.
I wish I had the energy to sketch up the idea for my full back piece, because I'm really excited about it.
Ronnie fucking off like he's not stoked to draw up my Studio Ghibli cat half sleeve.
I can't wait to have metallic to black ombre hair so people will know I don't want to be approached
Christopher Fotch is my absolute least favorite, but favorite person at the same time.
@Chrisfotch @teo_utd stahppp.
What an immature little bitch. Blocked me and then posted my mugshot on your fb? Lmaooo okay.
@juliaeliseberry I don't even know how to contour.
Just made my mom watch Dalí eat a rat.
In the mood to cry all over myself and watch Japanese horror films. So I think I will.
Just threw the biggest temper tantrum because Allie wouldn't let me get Coldstone. I'm going to kill myself.
The original Japanese Ringu is way creepier than the Ring.
@joshuawoodard you should start a class <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@joshuawoodard trying to be a hookah instructor &gt;
My friend group collided tonight, and that was cool.
Really need to take a minute to step back and fix my fucking life.
Getting realllll tired of this shit. Feeling like a burden is great. Staying home for a while.
Eden and I agree, sex is really fucking gross. Like, really.
@Eedzz -"he's so pop punk even his face is pizza"
Calum Jeremiah Reginald Lee Simmons is somethin' else.
@Eedzz -"glass skin and paper bones"
Calum- "Marisa Patricia Bartholomew... you need to watch your mouth."
Nigel Thornberry here... natures amazing.
@Eedzz -"at least we're not like @erock352 , a 60s baby" damn son...
@Eedzz -that ponytail is older than some of the girls he dates"
@Eedzz -"he has a child, he's no one's type"
I had a dream last night that I was at SXSW with @mikaylax and @chchchadTM ... what?
@AlieHouseOfGray @Eedzz wtf did you even just say?
Disclaimer: I really fucking hate my friends rn for making me one of them.
@Eedzz @AlieHouseOfGray I will complain to my hearts content because da bbs tired and uglyyyy
I was just going to like, nap all day. And now @Eedzz and @AlieHouseOfGray expect me to get up and get ready?
Losing my literal fucking mind.
It seems as though the bae, @Eedzz and I will be accidentally getting matching tattoos. Ydg.
@Jijit27 @Eedzz heckkk yeah! We try our best
@Jijit27 @Eedzz lmaooo why because we're idiots?!
@Eedzz -"I'm meant to be a mother one day... Fuck her right in the pussy."
@Jijit27 it's true too
@ocalafloriduh -"I'm infected all around my face and brain... and head."
@Jijit27 that's not the same thing alex!
@Jijit27 @Eedzz she's going off on jit rn!
@Eedzz -"that little bit of hair ain't hiding nothin kid. Grow up with a 7 finger forehead." Tell em how you really feel.
@Eedzz -"you know how British kids look different that American kids? Like big forehead and thin lips?"
Mom- "caught you on the down low. I'm hip right? Hip and rad and all that cool shit? Yeah, radical."
The king of the cat kingdom, the Cat King!
@Eedzz you're right babe. I'm a bum, I'm sorry.
@Eedzz I sorry bb &gt;.&gt;
Anyone wanna come watch Studio Ghibli with me? No? Coo, I'm gunna nap.

Watched the most beautiful juggalo wedding last night *gouges eyes out and loses all hope for humanity*
@joshua_gant should be going to daytona lame.
@juliaeliseberry damn money :/
Getting forced to Daytona. I mean, ight.
@juliaeliseberry this is why we can't even be married.
@Eedzz okay, we'll probably be back around then
I need to go into town today. Blaaaah.
@erock352 -____-
@erock352 uhh... yup. Sounds about right.
@erock352 you're like that eminem/Rihanna song rn.
@erock352 I wish you would stop lying to yourself... it's not healthy.
My favorite past time is making PiZaps of @erock352
Shay- "they're either going to be on Jerry Springer or 48 Hours... I'm leaving toward 48 Hours"
@juliaeliseberry we really are
@juliaeliseberry this is why our children our children are turning out so horridly... I don't like sharing :/
@juliaeliseberry Michael's mine, fuck off.
@juliaeliseberry <SMIRKING FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Howl's Moving Castle while I finally put my laundry away.
I swear to god if I ever see @juliaeliseberry with her hair in a top knot, I am going to conserve the shit out of her.
@erock352 basically
Shout out to the two dirty hood rats next to me in the probation office talking about how they can't wait to test so they can go smoke.
Still true. 
Of course i would have to wake up gross early the morning after I was violently exorcist vomiting to drug and alcohol test. Sweeeet.
This company is amazing. I need a pair so bad. 
Literally fucking dying rn.
The Cat Returns because adult.
What a stupid holiday. All the various shades of green meshing together is making my stomach churn.
Pretty sure I need to shower soon so my stinky friends will look bad. But I don't want to move.
@Eedzz and shrek sleepover
Found out tonight @juliaeliseberry and I should not, repeat, should not be allowed to be a lesbian couple and adopt a child. Ever.
"Who am I going to cheat on you with, my left hand?!" - @Eedzz slays me.
"It's like the ancient Chinese proverb; if you a lame, that's a shame, you can't hang with us" - @Eedzz
"Love made me", the inscription over Hells Gates as said in Dante's Inferno.
Is there a color darker than black? Because I would like to wear that color rn.
Don't know if I'm seeing my friends since I can't drive, so I'm going to sleep.
I feel so sick. They made me out to be a straight alcoholic scumbag.
Man. This next year is going to suck so much dick.
That did not go well at all. Pretty upset and discouraged. I just want to see my friends.

@juliaeliseberry thanks bee, I'll let you know how it goes ♡
T-minus 3 hours. I think I'm about to throw up.
Tomorrow is the day I find out just how bad I'm getting fucked. What even is sleep?
Glad I spent my last night of freedom watching Norma Jean kill Ocala with all my favorite people.
@Eedzz I don't even know why!
@Eedzz just said Hot Topic smells like sad fathers. Done.
@erock352 I hate you grand pa paw.
Makeup is the devil and I love it. Thank you Based God.
I swear I look like a fucking alien until my makeup is completely done.
Trying to hurry and put my face on for my date with @Eedzz
Johnathan Davis' voice &gt;
@DaveCTE hahaha thank god for snapchat buddy!
Hey guys, you remember when Jyesopher was cool?! Yeah me either <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE THROWING A KISS> @jyemenzies 
Jiji from Kiki's Delivery Service is literally me.
This bitch has one centimeter more to roll towards my car before I run her moped over and beat her ass.
3am at McDonald's after work and this broad pulls up behind me in a moped... done.
Homeboy behind me with the led headlights has got my anxiety through the fucking ceiling.
@Eedzz I know babe:)
Feel like an ugly piece of garbage. Hope my friends come out tonight.
Just sized up to 1" &amp; 1/8 :)
@erock352 I did, and that killed me!
@erock352 I just died! Omg!
@Eedzz riiiight?!
Watching Untold Stories of the ER with mom and out of nowhere she goes, "yeah well you're still a fucking ugly dyke bitch" I love my mom.
@BrandonCTE that was like a fucking mini movie dude lol
Still in bed. Still throwing up. This is awesome.
My nerves are ruining me, I've been in bed throwing up all day.
Have the worst headache and been up puking for hours. Awesomeee.
Just laid in the shower for like an hour, don't feel any better.
Can I be Miley Cyrus when I grow up? Okay cool.
@erock352 
@erock352 please no grampy I'm sorry:/
@erock352 I will grand pa paw!
Wish I knew why the roof of my mouth hurt so bad.
@AlieHouseOfGray it made me pukey af.
Stepdad just came in to make sure I wasn't dead because I literally haven't moved all day.
Curled in a ball watching Princess Mononoke. Fwm.

I just want breakfast food. Going back to bed so I can't think about being hungry.
Everyone around me is all like "you need a boyfriend" and i'm all like "so about this probation/ suspended license thing"
Starving. To literal death.
@erock352 blaaaaaaaagh bobby.
I really want to hangout with my friends later, but I don't want to burden anyone for rides. So, I probably won't be around much anymore :/
Whisper of the Heart makes me sick.
Watching Studio Ghibli by myself and filling out job apps hoping to god that things turn around.
I really hate being myself because all I do is think about how much I hate myself, and how insanely difficult the next year will be.
@AlieHouseOfGray just ripped off her shirt and threw it on my face... I'm done.
@Eedzz -"Can you guys hookup? We'll get a box of condoms and poke holes in them, if you get pregnant it's meant to be. Like baby roulette"
PSA: I am not in a good state. If you have an issue, please do not pester anyone else about it. Everyone leave me alone.
Slumber party for my last few days of freedom? @AlieHouseOfGray @Eedzz
My friends are being so amazing. The fact that they even bailed me out makes me feel so bad.
@Eedzz okeeeee:)
@Eedzz if you would like, I'm down.
Everything about my life hurts. I just want icecream.
Going to lay in bed all day watching Studio Ghibli trying not to lose all nope and kill myself.
#ManBunMonday #ProtectTheKnot
@JaydenPanesso i'm about to get back on my GameBoy Color heavy.
It's getting really hard to pretend like i'm okay when i'm about to lose absolutely everything. I just can't do it.
@yunglungs I literally can't handle the image I just got from your description!
@yunglungs Thoma please!
@teo_utd thank god!
The babe @Eedzz and I are so sXe4L it hurts.
@jyemenzies the literal latest reply ever.... but you're right!
I just feel really like, numb I guess.
@Eedzz thanks babe, I'm glad I wifed you up!
I'm lactose intolerant so @Eedzz made me thousand cheese penne. #bestwifeaward
I can quite literally only go up from here.
@HaydenTree idk why but I had a dream we went to Harry potter world last night haha so come to fl soon nerd!
I would honestly rather just die.
I wish I had my Moose to hug until I felt better.
Cried all over my dinner because I keep getting reminded what a fuck up I am.
@erock352 thanks man :/
@erock352 I agree. But, it is what it is. I fucked up.
@erock352 my family. My job.
I hate myself so much. And now, so does everyone else. Guess I deserve that.
Watching stupid lifetime movies in the hope that I'll hate myself a little bit less. But I doubt it.
How things always get worse me I'm not sure. Here's to hoping I don't get fired and then kicked out tomorrow. I'm fucking sorry man.
Tried to help a friend and ended up in jail. I'll be ghost for the next year.
Calum- "oh Carol... sluttiest cat this side the Mississippi River"
#Donaldgloverforspiderman
Yo computer comp class... thank you for reminding me how much I've never in my life wanted to be an accountant.
Literally never going to remember how to do any of this shit for my test next week.
Adulted pretty hard today for someone who called off work. Now excuse me while I try to make myself finish this homework.
@BrandonCTE how bad is the ditch little bro? I'm doing that shit on my horror sleeve next week
@teo_utd hahahah don't be mad because I'm right nerd!
Fiery cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell <FIRE><OK HAND SIGN>
Ya girl is starving.
@teo_utd that's the least of them!
@DaniNeckDeep I was only on for 4 days and I had the craziest tan of my life
I don't really fangirl over music because I'm friends with so many people in the industry. I just fangirl really heavy over horror movies.
Haha I was on stage for you guys everyday and I never knew I took this @DaniNeckDeep 
Can I just have my Moose back... please? <CRYING CAT FACE> <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
It was a got damn deer-bra!
Dear Lord,
Today I am thankful for Crest White Strips, because those bitches really work.
Amen.
"Blaaaaaaah, fuck" - @tylerdennen
@DaniNeckDeep that awkward moment when you try to spell out the noises Tyler makes
@erock352 @AlieHouseOfGray hursh
Me- "you said that so sarcastically!" Ryan- "that's just your insecurity!"
Me- "omg you should right swipe that" Ryan- "I probably already did" I'm dead!
@ocalafloriduh just said I look like Jar Jar Binks. Excuse me while I kill myself
@erock352 pour one out for me man
I bet the universe has a nice hearty laugh everyday shitting all over me.
@erock352 we're not going to 6 doe
@mikaylax Nope, I do it everyday
Dear Lord, 
I am thankful that it's $1 margarita night at El Toreo.
Amen.
@erock352 I might die before I make it to El Toreo!
Still haven't eaten yet.
I miss my foreign homies in @MartyrsTweets
accidentally took a 3 hour nap and it was glorious
Just got a prescreening phone interview:)
@erock352 I'm withering away currently.
@mike_von_doom I believe you
@erock352 like i'm so hungry, there's nothing I'm in the mood for!
@erock352 I need to, I'm dying. But idk what I want... or if I wanna get up to get it lol
I'm far too hungry and easily distracted to try to do excel rn.
fucking internet, I couldn't be any further from doing my homework.
@mike_von_doom here's my bedroom door... we won't even mention my sleeve. 
Adding to my horror leave in a week and a half. Shits coming along nice, adding Annabelle to the ditch. *not stoked on the spot
@mike_von_doom come at me bro. 
Guess i'll leave class, get some dunkin iced coffee, and cuddle with my bed all day.
Dear self, 
STOP PICKING YOUR FUCKING TATTOO.
-Thanks a heap coyote ugly.
@mike_von_doom you sound really stupid rn.
If you have to damn near stop your vehicle to make a turn, may you rot in hell.
Christopher Fotch... please be as completely aware as possible that I hate you and you're the worst person I know.
There's a special place in hell for people who use 'an' instead of 'and '.
There are too many people around me rn.
@HaydenTree the fuck else is new?!
All my friends are giving me shit for wanting to stretch my ears... feck offff!
@erock352 @ocalafloriduh you're so right
@ocalafloriduh  is being extra ignorant rn.
I really want a dd iced coffee for than anything, but leaving bed and putting my face on seems really unreasonable.
Biggest crush on Nyjah Huston.
@JaydenPanesso yooo see you guys in fl!
If I see one more cat commercial, I'm going to cry and hang myself.
Have not left my bed once today.
Faygo chugs. @AlieHouseOfGray @Eedzz @ocalafloriduh
We're watching a video of a juggalo rapping and Eric goes, "is someone going to help him? He's having a seizure."
It's people like you that make me want to nap all the time so I'm not bitter as fuck.
People are so fucking annoying. Act your age, or say that shit to you. People don't like you anymore for shit talking me.
@Eedzz omfg!!!!
My fingers hurt from holding onto the hood of @ocalafloriduh jeep while he drove in circles.
Eric- "that guy has no neck. He's like a thumb ontop of shoulders"
Dj plays emo music. Me- "this music makes me want to punch things".... punches @AlieHouseOfGray
So. Hungry.
The fuqqqq outta here
Nothing gets me angrier faster than when someone talks to me like a child. I'm not fucking stupid, you don't have to spell it out for me.
Face Swap is the devil.
I giggle anytime I see anything from @Eedzz because her name is The Omen in my phone!
@ocalafloriduh I meant besides who I already know
I miss my new georgia friends, Florida has no interesting people
Yes please.
Basically got told I'm a girl and need to stand at the counter looking pretty instead of being in the shop. Fight me.
I fucking hate walmart. There's one service writer and I'm not allowed to help in the shop so I'm literally sitting in the bathroom.
Haven't seen my coworkers in like an hour and a half and I'm fucking starving
@Eedzz I'd rather deal with him than literally anyone here
@Eedzz I would rather skin myself than be here.
I'll have my famous "walmart smile" on all day.
@Eedzz let's leave work and do that.
I'm literally sick to my stomach being at work. This is the absolute worst company. Time to start job hunting. #peacewalmart
@Eedzz - "I hope you get a lot of nice things in your kibbles and bits"
Why am I here and not asleep? Tired of hearing children pretend like they know about music.
@jyemenzies I hate you.
I literally hate everyone that's around me right now.
This bitch steady drinks a dd iced coffee infront of my face. Da fuq.
It is 9am and I couldn't be in a worse mood. People are the worst things ever. I just want my Moose.
I swear if this bitch does not leave me the fuck alone today I'm walking out. I'm not in the mood and she makes me hate being here.
@AnthonyJamessss please die.
Girls always get mad because they hear I have sex with their boyfriend.... like what? I can't rememebr the last time I kissed a boy.
@ocalafloriduh @joshuawoodard you stay out of this Guadalajara
Tattoos peeling already so it looks 50 shades of fucking repulsive.
@joshuawoodard stoppit josh!
#ProManBun #ProtectTheKnot
Someone just touched my tattoo... lord please stop me...
Tonight, I plan on getting @AlieHouseOfGray nice and drunk and putting my weiner in her mouth.
@AlieHouseOfGray that's what I'm saying.
@AlieHouseOfGray because I hate you.
I wish more than anything that someone would bring me a DD iced coffee to work. We'd be friends till the end like Andy Barkley and Chucky.
Underneath the influence.
@AlieHouseOfGray showers are for girls.
It's been a month since my baby Moose left me.... I'm still not okay.
Chucky is easily one of my favorite killers.
@HaydenTree I knew there was a reason we were friends pahahah people are too funny!
@HaydenTree I knew it the whole time homie. Everything makes sense now. Haha
@ocalafloriduh fucking die
@ocalafloriduh unlikely. I hate everyone.
I hope all my friends die. Mostly @AlieHouseOfGray @Eedzz  and @ocalafloriduh
@AlieHouseOfGray the Internet favorite lesbian couple. 
I'm in class starving almost to death. I'm going to go home and die since @AlieHouseOfGray has all my good movies -___-
I really hate getting tattooed. My arm is so swollen and crusty. Wah.
Lord help me I about just keyed a VW... non driving bitch.
Freddy Krueger is so lame. If one more person asks me if he's going on my horror sleeve I'm going to kill myself.
@Eedzz gimme name beebee.
Wims- "I didn't mention anything about your man bun but that's okay" I hate him
@Eedzz I know homie I'm playin, need me to fight someone?
@Eedzz don't call me out
Wims - "bitch.... don't... I will... what?"
The Ole arm is feeling it now Mr. Krabs.
Just saw a video of a guy beating the shit out of an old woman. I fucking hate people, I'm sick to my stomach.
We're watching Chuckie and mom goes, "takes a lickin and keeps on tickin, he's like a fucking timex... you gunna tweet that?" Christ.
My arm hurts so bad. I feel sick.
Just got my fucking armpit tattooed. Shits lame af.
I do not care who you arm, around the armpit is one of the worst places to get a tattoo.
@AlieHouseOfGray get out me, out me, out me car
I hate that @AlieHouseOfGray pretends to be different when lying about screenshotting.
So Tyler Mane as Michael Myers lives at Alie's apartment complex and he keeps staring at me. @AlieHouseOfGray please hurry.
Finishing the top half of my horror sleeve today... not stoked.
@tylerdennen it would be sick either way
What the fuck taco bell. Like why don't I have my food and my lunch break is over in 10 minutes.
Literally spent my whole lunch break standing in Taco Bell waiting for my lunch. Wtf is happening.
I fucking hate Florida more than anything. It was in the 20s on friday... it's goddamn 85 today. No wonder I'm always sick.
On the phone with @Chrisfotch and he starts his sentence with "you know Charles Manson right?" Pahahah
15 shots wasn't enough to make me feel better.
@Nadi_uh nooooo!
My 60 year old supervisor just told me to suck his ass.... fucking done!!!
I'm so depressed, I can't even leave my bed to see my friends. Going to bed because id rather be asleep.
Ordering a $200 replica stuffed animal of Moose. No shame, I just miss my baby so much.
So sad, I don't want to leave my bed ever again. I can't even pretend to be happy.
I miss coming home to Moose laying in my spot. I'm so fucking sad. 
If you need me, I'll be uncontrollably crying for a few hours until I can drink myself into a coma.
I may have reconciled with your friends, but I still don't like you try hard wannabe.
@ocalafloriduh "friends"
Shout out to walmart for the raise.
This new technician has to be one of the stupidest people I've ever met.
Still can't handle that my Moose is gone. Fuck man. I miss her so much. :(
@AlieHouseOfGray and I sent @ocalafloriduh 109 messages because we forgot he has a job.
I just want fries from checkers. <CHEQUERED FLAG><FRENCH FRIES><CHEQUERED FLAG><FRENCH FRIES><CHEQUERED FLAG><FRENCH FRIES><CHEQUERED FLAG>
I found my chapstick #godbless
Let my teacher not show up...
They need to stop giving a drivers license to anyone with a face.
Trying to sleep but I have the worst hiccups. What even?
Had to wrestle off a skid plate and the cartridge filter exploded and covered my entire torso and face in oil. Kill me.
My head hurts so bad. Wahhhh.
I cannot catch a fucking break. Damn man.
I'm fucking pissed. Probably failing my class.
We finished off quite a few bottles of vodka yesterday. Instead of being hungover, I'm insanely tired.
@shaunamustdie I hate myself lol
Day drinking.
Someone buy me a Barbie dream house for my birthday solely for the use of storing alcohol.
@ocalafloriduh - "I'm not sexist, I just don't respect women" pahahah
In the most real way I can say this... I'm about to punch the throat off @AlieHouseOfGray
This kid next to me never does shit but play games and type on his IM loud af. Like bruh go home, you already failed.
This class blows. Excel blows. Being hungry blows. ughhhh.
I'm so hungry in class i'm about to start gnawing on my textbook.
I had such a good weekend. I really really needed that.
Ya girl made mad money this weekend. Stoked.
It was crazy seeing the slideshow of my family's memories. 60 years my mem and pep have been married insane. It was so touching.
Grandparents 60th wedding anniversary party was so nice
My big brothers driving and yells, "build me a school Oprah!" I missed him lol
Sweet abundance of firearm bumper stickers on your jeep wrangler.... you must be quite the badass.
Spending my day off social media because fuck your valentine, and making fun of people with my big brother who came to town. Peace.
I have a hangover, happy valentines day.
Regular gave me $100 for no reason, fuck with me
I can't use my phone at work. Or smile. Or laugh. Or stand still. Or breathe.
The people with the most always want more, and talk to you like they have nothing. Stop being so selfish and greedy.
So much props to @tylerdennen and the rest if @SwornInBand , keep up the good work guys! Check out their new song "sunshine"
Whoever created dorito Loco tacos... thank you.
I fucking hate Walmart and the fact that I have to be here all day.
$1 Margarita night. #praise
Hey @AlieHouseOfGray , want some eyes for that eyeliner faggot?
Trolling MySpace so hard rn. I'm about to ruin your life @AlieHouseOfGray , Oli Sykes hair and all.
You know I don't feel good when I'm wearing leggings for pants.
I have the worst headache. Class is going to suck
Mom told me Moose is gone and I need to get over it. I will not get over my fur baby not being here with me.
This little face is the only thing that ever made me feel better. This is the last picture I took with her. 
These last few weeks could not have been any worse. I really don't know where to go from here. And I really just wish my cat was with me.
So fucking pissed off. I cannot win. I literally do not know what to do right now.
I suppose I'll get up now to raise hell at my piece of shit job.
It's quite literally sickening to me how much people only look out for themselves.
I wish I had friends that would help me find cool horror shit for my collection.
Had this dream last night. Represents anxiety and a great feeling of loss. Great. 
A Karp - "cats are the reincarnations of executed inmates"
Coming to terms with the idea that Moose knew it was her time and didn't want to be near me when it happened. I'm not okay.
<CRYING FACE><CRYING CAT FACE>♡
Literally too sad for life 
Watching purge anarchy with mom and she goes, "get your fucking ass up bitch, the fuck you waitin on?" My god
This dude with a damn sxt charger swears he's hot shit. You and your 4 cylinders get your shit and go.
<NO ENTRY SIGN> social interaction <NO ENTRY SIGN>
"@sl4mmy: can't believe how different booty calling and butt dialing are"
I miss my demon fur baby so fucking much man. 
<CRYING FACE> &lt; me always as of late.
We're all adults now. Why can no one just tell the truth and say how they feel? Childish shit.
Crying at work because nothing ever gets better for me. Finding out I can't tour anymore and my friends don't like me isn't making it better
I really hate people. I have no desire to be around people ever. Which only makes me miss my cat more. &lt;/3
Kind of day that just makes me want to crawl into a hole. Haven't eaten all day, and i'm crying all over myself trying to do stat hw.
Today couldn't be worse. Found out I can't go on tour, it wasn't my cat the people found, got covered in hot oil, and Im doing hw till work.
That awkward moment when you're changing an oil filter and get hot oil all the way up your arm and in your eyebrow &gt;:/
If these people actually found Moose I will break all the way down.
Life mood music: Front Porch Step
I don't know why I keep thinking eventually something good will happen to me. I'm meant to be broken and sad.
I couldn't be anymore disgusted and disappointed in the way people are. Not in the mood to speak to anyone. So don't bother.
The Nightmare Factory is where it's at. Their shit is legit, and it got here in two days.
I hate MerchNow. Idk why they bother with ship and receive dates because that shit ends up processing for two months instead.
That and I made an appt to finish off my half sleeve. I'm not stoked actually because that spot will blow so much dick.
At least my Jason mask should be here tomorrow. The literal only thing I have going for me right now.
Schmidt from New Girl is my favorite character from any show ever.
Disgusted with myself, delighted with none.
If you're my friend, and let your friends shit talk me on your social media... you will literally never hear from me again.
Not to mention there's a huge fucking scratch on my car. I don't even fucking park near people. Fuck humans so hard. I miss my cat.
I literally fucking hate human interaction. You don't know me, so why are you being a complete asshole to me?
Just got a free large iced coffee from Dunkin... alright
@mikaylax I do that literally every other day
Why are people so fucking rude?
Literally had the worst dream. Pretty sure I'll be sad all day now
This Moose tattoo literally itches so hard. It better not fall out after all this.
Spent far too much money today and drank a lot of alcohol and all it made me realize is nothing will change how much I miss Moose.
I'm trying to enjoy my sushi and alcohol and homeboy behind me is talking about how much he hates ribbed condoms.
Jordan is one of my favorite people because he will get sushi with me at a moments notice.
Anyone wanna get sushi? No? Ok.
I'm not sure I could ever get another cat, I'd much rather just get a dog as my next pet but I know mom won't go for it. Poor Moose :/
Finishing my half sleeve soon. Also, ordering mannequin heads soon to start my replica horror mask collection. Excitement is real.
Why am I forever dealing with grown adults acting like children?
What even is the point of Excel? This class has me about to knockkk out.
Every fucking day this kid walks in class asking if there's something do. Bruh, do your homework and stfu.
Someone please be friends with @Chrisfotch . He just wrote me on every possible media at once. Like, I'll pay you...
Going to buy mannequin heads soon so that I can spend large sums of money of replica horror masks.
In literal disbelief that I'm still awake rn.
Why the fuck do I have so much homework?
why do I feel sick literally all the time?
I swear on everything if I hear "just don't get your face tattooed" one more time...
Feel like a middle-aged woman watching the Lifetime movie Pregnancy Project while I do my homework. #PartyAnimal
@mclovindouble thinks it's funny watching me suffer through my homework so his next thought was to put on Human Centipede. Kill me.
@Chrisfotch I wish you would punk
@Chrisfotch stop talking about me like that
Having the realist talk rn. I feel old man.
@Chrisfotch -"yeah I bet she like wrote that, threw her phone down, and ate Taco Bell"
I can't stand the way this girl talks. Like, why do you speak like a 14 year old on MySpace?
I've had a dream every night that Moose came back, and it's slowly killing me.
I miss my Moose so much. Sigh.
Working four and a half hours today... why even?
I have an unhealthy need to watch New Girl, but I'm so tired.
This tattoo on my thumb/ palm has the be the itchiest fucking tattoo ever.
My dad doesn't find me as funny as I do. #TeamNoSnow 
@mikaylax @WeArePalisades @LouMiceliJr omggg I can't!
@mclovindouble -"you know when someone tries to get something off you for a long time?" Me-"is it your virginity?"
I think my friends forget I'm a girl sometimes.
So like, what happens when Mary Shaw screams?
Watching Dead Silence with mom
@ieatfrogs11 I want one of those shirts. So you're now obligated to order smalls.
This fucking girl is so annoying. Please just sit next to the professor.
This kid probably wants to die because our professor and I are from New England so I've got the hat and he's wearing a Patriots shirt.
This poor poor soul just walked in class with a seahawks shirt, snapback, and backpack... he wasn't stoked when he saw my Patriots snapback.
@mclovindouble oh my fucking godddddd!
Someone really just called the superbowl a satanic ritual... do us all a favor and off yourself.
Interceptions will be the death of me. My anxiety is through the roof.
Missy Elliot is still a fucking beast.
Watching Katy Perry's halftime show and my mom looks at me and goes, "fucking gay." Lmao
Fuck the Seahawks for that last touchdown.
2nd quarter and we're tied. Enough of this, let's slaughter em.
Let's fucking go. 
@mclovindouble it's cool homie
@mclovindouble I didn't know no one would be home
Watching the superbowl by myself... cool.
Still can't believe that shit happened. Why resort to stabbing someone in the back?
Someone got stabbed at four times tonight resulting from a fight at our bar. And he wasn't even involved. Shits crazy now a days
Almost just got in a fight at work until security threw them out. I hate people.
@Nadi_uh just confused the Phillies with the Philadelphia Eagles.... cannot!
@AnthonyJamessss that's worse than my mom with the ribs!
I would so much rather lay in my bed and cry than go to work tonight
@AnthonyJamessss deadddddd omg
Walk in the house and my mom is crying because she misses my cat. Excuse me while I condense into a puddle.
The Chippendale show last night made me feel filthy, uncomfortable, and insanely single all at the same time.
Makeup matches how I feel tonight
@sl4mmy I've been trying to find someone to do softball things forever!
@sl4mmy pick me
@mclovindouble it's true man
@mclovindouble MO was like guys leave her alone she's being serious and she might cry
@mclovindouble Joe. And dustin was trying to say moose is in my chinese.

Why my coworker just told me a story about a cat getting shot is beyond me.
Miss my fur baby so much. I just want to be asleep, being awake is dreadful.
@littleh0tmess you get me
Why the fuck is my mom arguing with me about my cats name? She's my cat and her names always been Moose?
@HaydenTree you coming here nerd?
So I was going to wait until I got the portrait done, but I'm getting Moose's name tattooed on my hand tomorrow. Judge if you wish.
Why in the literal fuck are overalls even allowed?
i'm so depressed that spending copious amounts of money on doc martens sounds like a good idea.
"Bathtubs are medieval filth cauldrons. Pass. I'm not interested in simmering in testicle tea for twenty minutes." - New Girl
Ordered a new debit card with Moose on it yesterday. I'm ready to wake up from this nightmare now. <CRYING CAT FACE><CRYING FACE>
I wonder if anyone else thinks @shaunamustdie and I are as funny as we do?
You're wearing a business suit but driving a fucking Mercury Sable station wagon? Move buster.
Dear god, someone take snapchat away from @Chrisfotch
@mclovindouble it needs to be set on fire!
In an attempt to find Moose earlier, Jordan and I entered a horror movie like abandoned house and quite literally almost died.
So why @mclovindouble look like Jess from the Thirteenth Year?
You know my cat being gone is serious when my mom lays next to me and cries with me.
@shaunamustdie omg please!
I can by no means handle that @shaunamustdie just described someone's picture as "jank".
@AlieHouseOfGray I literally don't know what to do with myself without her
@AlieHouseOfGray I was thinking the same thing
@AlieHouseOfGray yeah. I'm 100% not okay with it.
@AlieHouseOfGray yeah. 3 days now.
@shaunamustdie absolutely. You can't judge me in a long demin skirt and cowboy boots. #sorrynotsorry
@shaunamustdie I went to high school with a girl like that, she ended up leaving the religion. I couldn't do it lol
@shaunamustdie I think you're right because she has super long hair in a pony and no makeup
@shaunamustdie maybe. But she wears the strangest boots with it.
I'm so upset about my cat that my filter and patience are one hundred percent gone.
This girls wears a long denim skirt and high boots everyday to class... and it actually really freaks me out.
I hate him, but I know @Chrisfotch is my bestfriend because he said if I offed myself he'd still look for Moose.
Legitimately can't sleep because I've never been home and not had my cat sleeping next to me. Can't stop crying.
I miss this little face so much. She's the most important thing to me and it's killing me she's gone. 
1000% not okay right now.
If my stepdad reminds me that Moose is gone and how cold she must've been last night one more time.
Tried the pound and she's not there. I'm not going to give up. :/
Just broke into an abandoned house looking for Moose. I'm currently a wreck.
Crying omw to work because my cats still gone. Nbd.
@teacatsnetflix no, that was just me being extra sad because I still haven't found her.
Ugh. 
Literally having an anxiety attack because I can't find my Princess.
Moose still hasn't come back. Sad.
Disciples of the Ram.
Still no Moose. Excuse me while I gorge myself in ihop and watch Annabelle.
The few friends I have are the best; @mclovindouble is bringing me iHop because I'm depressed.
Moms making me an appointment because the last two days I haven't been able to breathe, my blood pressures been high, and pulse high af.
If I do not locate my cat before this storm hits, I'm pretty sure I'll have an anxiety attack and there will be no calming me.
<CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> &lt; me rn.
I don't think anyone understands the severity of me not being able to find Moose.
Excuse me while I cry until I find my cat.
Just found out Moose ran away. I think I'm going to puke.
@mclovindouble I'm just slowly dying. Nbd
@mclovindouble yeah well I can't cook and my family hates me so shut up!
Sushi and the Interview
Just had a dude literally chase after me leaving publix to tell me he liked my hair... thank you?
Since I already feel like shit, I'm just going to eat my body weight in spicy shrimp rolls.
I feel so sick still, I look homeless in class rn. Whitechapel long sleeve and basically dreaded hairs.
This guy in my class is wearing so much cologne I literally almost puked and had to move
I would spend copious amounts of money on a realistic Annabelle doll.
Still feel like garbage. Super.
Still feel like complete shit, this is insane.
Can we just go back to Halloween? @Nadi_uh 
@Chrisfotch I'll expose the real you Christopher
@Chrisfotch you'll feel better when you admit the truth.
I swear if @AnthonyJamessss doesn't stop yelling at me when I have a hangover...
Idk why, but I think Marilyn Manson's video for Beautiful People will always be dope af.
SOS. I need soup. This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill.
Pretty sure @Chrisfotch is hoping I find a new bestfriend so he doesn't have to talk to me anymore. It's funny how much we hate eachother.
Literally too hungover for life rn.
I hate putting on makeup. And I hate that I can't go anywhere without it.
Pretty sure I've never listened to Pandora without A Boy Brushed Red Living In Black and White coming on.
No amount of makeup in the world could cover these bags and make me look pretty for work tonight.
Pretty sure I repel affection. I haven't so much as slept on someones shoulder since sharing a bench on tour with @GusthaMC ages ago! Lol
Eyebrows and lipstick are very important to me. <LIPSTICK>
Not to mention I'm so hungry I think my bodies eating my brain. <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY><FORK AND KNIFE>
Literally too tired to function. Off at 4, doing homework, go in at 930, get off at 230, go in at 9. <ASTONISHED FACE><DIZZY FACE><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Don't get mad that I don't set time aside to text you and then talk shit about me on facebook, I don't even know you? #thirstyass
I just want doc martens and a sworn in jersey... someone love me.
Not sure when Moose decided sleeping on my ps3 was okay, but it's not.
Seriously so stoked rn! March is going to be a damn good month!
@Nadi_uh just hit a puddle and drenched this dude walking down the sidewalk lmaooo
@mclovindouble of course it was!
How do they make sugar free caramel if it's derived from sugar?
Shocker, I think I'm getting sushi for lunch.
My supervisor just said he's so old Socrates was his professor, Poseidon was his swim coach, and Zeus was his track coach... done!
I would rather strangle myself to death with my own hands than listen to this lady talk for my online stat class.
@Chrisfotch is the literal worst person alive. @teo_utd please bring him to Italy.
The bae @Chrisfotch is eating some food from a mystery land called Taco King instead of calling me so I can complain. Ighttt b.
I could go for a grateful dead, blue long island, and an Irish trashcan right about now. <BEER MUG><COCKTAIL GLASS><TROPICAL DRINK><WINE GLASS>
Added a Sweeney Todd piece to my leg yesterday. <HOCHO><BLACK SCISSORS>️<FACE MASSAGE><FORK AND KNIFE> 
Three months later they're trying to tell me I can't have my hair teal at work. The fuck outtta here.

@teo_utd you guys are so cooool. 
Sweeney Todd and pizza rolls <OK HAND SIGN>
@shaunamustdie lemme know when
@shaunamustdie anytime bae
The tattoo I got today actually really hurts, tf?
Had a DD iced coffee this morning and Tim just bought me an expresso... pretty sure I'm going to have a heart attack.
This spot is not tight. Scared as fuck to tattoo my knees because everywhere around it blows.
Heading to my natural habitat, Fat Kats Artistry, to get a few tattoos to fill in my leg.
@DaniNeckDeep I doubt it's necessary, but just remember you said that homie! Haha
@DaniNeckDeep yo don't make me cry!
Legitimately stoked to see what @DaniNeckDeep did with this new album.

@shaunamustdie as everyone should
@shaunamustdie I'm getting some fillers, a date and a Sweeney Todd razor
Work day in my computer comp class. I just want it to be over because I have an appt with Tattoo Man Tim today.
Thy Art is Murder. #DescribeYourSexLifeWithABand
This is the same kid that misses class and then asks everyone what happened. Shut upppppp. Jesus Christ.
This kid in my class thinks he's cool as fuck with his dad's bright blue Ram. You're not cool, shut the literal fuck up. You're like 18.

This homework is going to be a pain in the dick.
If you don't know me, why would you continuously text me asking if I'm okay? Like no, you're bothering me.
@BrandonCTE we need to go back to that smoothie place in orlando, that shit was delicious!
@AlieHouseOfGray -________-
The moral of this story is that I'm now currently starving.
@AlieHouseOfGray my god
@AlieHouseOfGray that's a really good idea actually.
@AlieHouseOfGray well mines in the trash... so die. Ughhhhh.
@AlieHouseOfGray yeah fuck you because now I always want sushi. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I'm beyond pissed. First my stepdad cooks my mom a big ass breakfast, then find out she threw away my entire sushi tray. Unfuckingreal.
Happy birthday @AnthonyJamessss you old fucking bat!! <GRINNING FACE><PARTY POPPER><BALLOON><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Stoked af that my homie is coming over to clean and wax my car later. Yuhhh.
I hate when my stepdad sneezes because it's always like 8 fucking times in a row. Like pipe down already.

In honor of MLK day, I'll be going to the bar with my sort of black friend @AnthonyJamessss #wemadeit
Ya girl finally got chinese buffet.
@AnthonyJamessss run it lil nigga
@AnthonyJamessss shut up.
My mom just said I'm ridiculous and she hopes she lives to see the day I say I regret all my tattoos. Okay.
Trying to communicate with people literally makes my anxiety skyrocket.
@Chrisfotch is probably my bestfriend, that is all. #sadtweet
Why are all the people around me so fucking shitty to me? Like you guys wonder why I'm an asshole and drop all my friends.
Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers ran track in high school.
Still haven't gotten a payment book for my car and I'm on my second payment. Tf?
Spicy shrimp rolls on point. <FRIED SHRIMP><BENTO BOX><SUSHI>
Everyones favorite dark mermaid. 
This fucking sushi is on point though, props Publix!
I'm being way too basic rn; sushi and iced coffee. #2basik4u
That Jesus license plate wouldn't have saved you had you hit my fucking car with your little white camry.
Think I'll head to Publix and get some sushi.
I want Chinese buffet so bad. Why don't I have friends?
God bless MLK and not having school today.
Home from work exhausted with a ton of homework due by midnight.... who else is willing to bet that wont happen??
Valentines Day is for the birds... or like, people with significant others I guess.
@AnthonyJamessss lmao please stop!
I think of @AnthonyJamessss anytime Justin Timberlake plays at work.
Crocs are not okay, ever. Stop.
It is unreal how tired I am. Yesterday is not what's up. And I have a fuck ton of homework due tonight. We'll see how this goes.
If you're over 6 foot, no matter what dance move you do, it looks like the worm... no matter what.
Remember that time I said I wasn't going to drink anymore? I lied.
Ihop. Drinking hot cocoa with a straw because adult.
Jay- "I work on cars, not customers." Lmaooo done.
I just want to have a horror marathon with my cat.
I feel like if I don't leave my bed, I can pretend I won't be working nonstop until 2am today.
These girls make me laugh too hard. Stop.
I can't handle the music at our bar rn.
I always get weirdly anxious whenever I go to do my eyebrows because I'm always like man, what if this is the time I fuck up?
This commercial just said, "their eco boost makes my V4 drive like a V6".... stop.
Tried to nap between jobs and I can't fall asleep. Wonderful.
She's like the RC Cola of people. No one really wants it, but they'll take it if it's there.
I'm trying to do my homework and my cat is literally laying on my neck and proceeds to lick my face if I try to look around her. Sigh.
Having the hardest time trying to decide what to do for knee tattoos.
Ingested a 16oz Redbull and a medium DD iced coffee today; maybe i'll have a heart attack and I won't have to work.
You and your boyfriend can't have the same eyebrows, you just can't.
I'm so stressed, I could puke. And I work 16 straight hours tomorrow. And the fact that this Stat class is online is not helping.
Statistics fucking sucks.
Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep you here. Three cheers for keeping me here too.
You can't drive a V8 hemi like it's a fucking Corolla.
Between working two jobs and going to school fulltime, I'm always stressed out. And now I have to request off a day to do photos at a party.
I have so much to do between jobs tonight. Fuck me.
Commence the weekend of nonstop working.  Whoo.
@SpencerICE9K leave it to @justinINK make it awkward!
My next car is going to have wifi. #bet
I think this whole "tattooed and employed" franchise is the most obnoxious thing ever.
@sl4mmy I thought I was the only one!
I can't make myself like Blink 182. #sorrynotsorry
Wide awake, but I refuse to move until my alarm goes off.
@iammichaelowens wasn't there something like that in the fairly odd parents too?
Going to bed since I have no food or friends.
Mom walks in to tell me she brought me leftovers. Thanks for the scraps homie.
@Chrisfotch wants to be me so bad. He ended up drawing on my tattoos. #youcantsitwithus 
When my friends straight admit they forgot about me. This day is becoming unfuckingreal.
My tattoo artist and I have the best talks. 
You couldn't make me buy a Ford. Or a Dodge, unless it was a Viper or an SRT10 Charger.
@JaydenPanesso you're my homie and all but you literally could not be more wrong rn. 
Current mood : <GRINNING FACE><PISTOL> 
I'm so tight rn, this is unreal.
I love that I never fucking hear from my friends, let alone see them. I'm never invited anywhere but they always seem out and about. <SNAKE>
Parents woke me up to tell me they're getting food without me. Wonderful.
Nose goes.
If you know how to properly gel back your hard part fade, I will fall in love with you.

Dirtbag. 
I fucking hate those kids that pretend like they know everything about the government. Stfu.
Don't be that guy that misses class and then comes in trying to ask everyone what happened.

You're like 20 years old, why do you have mom hair?

My TimeHop is too funny rn, you were such a waste of absolutely everything!
@mikaylax mines worse
@Chrisfotch left me the sweetest Skype message last night... and by that, I mean I hate him more than anyone.
Not sure how I feel about AHS Coven, but I do find myself with nothing to watch again.
My dentist was hot af, and no one warned me.
If you post a screenshot of our conversation on the Internet and don't cross out my number, we're not friends anymore.
My parents are such dildos. They always go eat without me.
If you're scared to drive over 40 mph, get the fuck off the road.
I would give my first born child for some hibachi rn.

@AnthonyJamessss hahaha I'm still tight about it! I asked for soup, I don't want no damn ribs... the nerve lol
I'm a sucker for ihop, hibachi, and most important, homemade mashed potatoes.
Still in disbelief over how ridiculously audacious all that was.
I'm sick so I ask my mom to make me chicken noodle soup and she asks if I want ribs instead... does that sound like god damn soup to you?
Everyone go give the little bro @BrandonCTE love for his birthday! #feeling22
Current mood. 
Some girls were straight jealous of my "style" last night &amp; I was mad confused cause like, I just threw some shit on.

Hopefully touring again in March. It's such a sick lineup.
It's wicked cold outta no where FL, but you can't keep me from my extra extra caramel mocha DD iced coffee homie.
Did a thing. @DaniNeckDeep 
Feel like since everyone thinks I'm an old school pinup girl in my mechanic uniform anyway, I just need @mikaylax to do my makeup one day.
I fuck with pizza rolls so heavy.
Don't work till 3... not bed until 245. Holla.

@Chrisfotch that's s blatant lie
First day of class tomorrow and then another tattoo appointment to just about finish one of my legs.
@Chrisfotch needs to get a new phone sooner than immediately so I have someone to bitch to.
@shellfight <RAISED HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
I had a dream that I was dating someone super cool who liked me a lot... and then I woke up and laughed.
This day is shaping up to be real shitty.
Too tired to be torquing tires rn.
I swear all you have to do is look unhappy at walmart and we'll give you your shit for free.
@BrandonCTE I wish all your fangirls could see it, it's priceless! You really should consider getting a new one!
Listening to FFTL because middle school feelings.
Everyone needs to see @BrandonCTE licence photo if they ever get a chance!
Repping @statusofmine today. 
Convinced this girl crawled out of Satan's whore house.
Fucking weeaboos.
So there's a brand new Corvette Stingray and a Viper at Forest rn....  fucking Viper. Rest in peace my feelings.
I was wondering why I hate the holidays, and then @shaunamustdie Christmas tree tried to kill me... and then I remembered.
@shaunamustdie it tried to eat my arm and almost ripped my leg off, but glad to help bae lmao
In the words of one of my best homies, "be yourself, by yourself... stay away from me." Best advice.
Let's go back to the Welcome to the Resistance Tour. So many good times on that one. 
Lol, I guess.
I will never understand why it's trendy for some pop punk bands to have awful vocalists. Like what?
@shaunamustdie - "I ain't even got words for you fatass... I'm pissed"
@Chrisfotch omg so you're like, a tour manager?! So do you like, know famous people and stuff?!
I would be angry with @shaunamustdie for calling and waking me up, except she brought up ihop and all is fine again.
I'm not sure I can be mean and vicious to the people around me if I'm literally never around people...
@Chrisfotch jk, I have no friends
@Chrisfotch damn. You right.
Just because someone follows me on social media, does not make us friends.
@Chrisfotch no wonder you won't text me back fam :/
That's some fancy jargon you got there.
@shaunamustdie I meant about my technician lol that's all just a hoax to try to be better but it's cool.
@shaunamustdie like how am I supposed to feel about this?!
One of my technicians is still in high school and today he told me that I'm "too old to be cool anymore." Well damn.
I literally have no trust for human beings. I would rather be a mean and lonely bitch than made to be a fool. But I am by no means bitter.
I feel as though someone shouldnt try to make me out to be a mean person if youve personally done me wrong, and I tell people im an asshole.
Did I mention this town is cancer? Is it March yet so I can hit the road?
Shout to all the bummy ass exs, friends, and haters I saw last night.
Tonight was awkward as shit. But, Wage War was the only fitting opener, and ADTR fucking murdered Ocala tonight. Shit was dope.
Adam Elmakias just took my picture. Fucking ill.
This town is cancer.
Just passed everyone I hate in Ocala. Hope I look okay for how hard I was stared at. Good thing I was on the list:)
@lizzythebatman I mean I wasn't there, I just like his music.
@Chrisfotch damn bro, me too. You right
I don't know how to feel about this whole Front Porch Step fiasco because like, I still really like his music.
@Chrisfotch @JaydenPanesso wicked big talk for someone across the country homie, see me on FL!
I don't have a new year resolution bullshit. But I will say no one will get the better of me this year. Not again.
I can't handle my uncle being hip and talking to me on messenger rn.
Starting my whole stomach piece soon. Rest in peace future family.
Yo, @JaydenPanesso , tell @Chrisfotch to stop talkin that shit!
Me- "mom get your boob off my arm." Mom-" oh you like it, shut up." Damn, okay.
Pretty sure Fotch just called me to tell me I make my cat miserable... I hope your jacket gets torched!

Go Pro View
RETWEET!


@Chrisfotch you make me so <GRINNING FACE><PISTOL>
@Chrisfotch you're so internet. How'd you get so cool?
Your teeth can't be the same color as your lipstick.
She's a fucking witch. 
Captain Hook can get it.
Working in a bar has made me certain of one thing, I fucking hate radio popular music.
Literally think I lost like 15 pounds from how sick I was yesterday.
I'm going to refer to you as Peter Pan since you're trying so hard to live in my shadow.
Woke up with the worst headache and a nosebleed. I'm dying.
@littleh0tmess I was rolling when she said it, she's such a spitfire now!
I'm so shot rn. <GRINNING FACE><PISTOL>
They say you have to fight your own demons. But how am I supposed to fight myself?
@Chrisfotch wanna start the new year with a salty attitude. Damn b. Why you tight son?!
If you do your eyebrows badly, I don't trust you.
Me- "why does she want to be me so bad" mom- "idk, but she's still ugly." Lmao
You say I get tattoos "to look cool to other people" and yet you've copied ever tattoo I've ever gotten and dyed your hair like mine? Okay.
If your profile picture on any social media is your ass on a bathroom counter, I hate you.
I'm a miserable fuck rn. Going to lay in the tub until I shrivel up and wither away. Bye.
kill @teo_utd <HOCHO><HOCHO><HOCHO>
Rest in peace my soul.
Had to leave work. I think I caught the bug everyone else had.
Hangover game is way too fucking strong rn.
Brought in the new year taking shots with my boys. Let's see what's up 2015.
To the people who have been setting off fireworks for four hours.... please die.
Here's to the New Year's kiss I'll be having with a bottle of Fireball tonight. Ayeee.
If you wear timberlands, I hate you.
I can't even imagine how much scarification hurts.
Show has me too stressed right now.
I don't have friends because when I actually try to make plans, they break them.
I want ihop. Sad.
Once Upon A Time has my anxiety through the roof rn.
@Chrisfotch I use it on the reg
At my maximum rage potential right now.
About to sock this customer right in his throat piece.
My soul is dead and all I can do is dig my own grave.
You're everything you taught me never to be.  Sick and twisted, fucked up and ruthless. Deranged at worst, and at very best useless.
Hey remember that time I dated that guy who really liked me? Yeah, me either.
@Nadi_uh I am home. I'm going through my phone and deleting pictures, those are super old
Okay. I might have a problem. 
I don't have a problem. 
No but seriously, why can't I sleep. That's all I want to be doing. Whyyyy.
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh all I can see if complete liver annihilation
@Nadi_uh @mikaylax I can't even imagine the three of us tearin up Texas
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh yeeeeee
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh can we please
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh yes ma'am...
@mikaylax @Nadi_uh and me
I can't even have a casual dinner with a friend without getting drunk.
Riding in a huge lifted truck... what am I doing with my life?
Think I'll go get obliterated. RIP what's left of my liver.
@Chrisfotch fall back homie
@Chrisfotch no, it's mine, get outta here!
@Chrisfotch stop getting mad when I put the truth on the Internet!
PSN is just as shitty as iPhones.
<BLUE HEART> &lt; dis my heart. Rest in peace future relationships.
I need more killstar things.
@Chrisfotch everyone makes mistakes homie. Everyone knows you're an asshole!
Peter Pan is a cunt in Once Upon A Time.
Mashed potato appreciation post.
Hope everyone's as stoked as your favorite mermaid that the holidays are over. They're for the birds. 
I need everyone to know that @Chrisfotch is the literal greatest person I know! He send me the sworn in lanyard I wanted for christmas!!
I can't close my fucking eyes. I sure as hell can't be fucking alive.
Hard parts and top knots. <OK HAND SIGN>
Why do I not live back up north?
@JaydenPanesso don't play with me, say you swear?!
A coworker just described me as, and I quote, "a wolf in sheep's clothing with an evil that rumbles within." Sounds about right.
I have this bad habit of checking my phone constantly. It's a bad habit because I never talk to anyone.
I have never been disappointed with a Publix sub. Ever. Shits on point.
Trish- "I love our uniforms, it's like jammie  time all the time"
If you're a living person, there's a pretty good chance I hate you and everything you stand for.
So pissed off at everything. I just want McDonald's dude.
@Chrisfotch and I have had too many heart to hearts lately... the fuck are we going through?
I need some doc martens fam
Why in the hell is PSN still down?
Supervisor poured oil all over my pants. I am so salty.
@JaydenPanesso there's no such thing as too much fireball homie! Haha you're welcome!
Happy birthday son, drink some fireball for me! @JaydenPanesso
My stepdad just told me I'm a communist because I don't like Elvis. I mean.. alright.
Just introduced mom to fireball, Merry Christmas
My mom stares at me, starts smiling and laughing, and goes "I hate you. You're pretty and I hate you"
Someone broke in our house last night and left an unwrapped gift under the tree, and my stepdads convinced it was santa.
Mom and I got my stepdad so much shit to keep him occupied, we might not hear from him till next Christmas. #hiddenagenda
Dear PSN, please stop lagging when I'm trying to blow people's faces off. Thanks a heap, Sly.
I'm hungry as shit and there's no food, so I guess I'll just take some shots. #logic
I'm starving almost to death. Let's get this Christmas dinner poppin. Rest in peace my body.
@JaydenPanesso that's the only way to get through the holidays though
I'm going to fucking shoot someone if I can't get my ps3 to come up on my new TV
Apparently a fight broke out with my mom's family yesterday... so pissed we weren't there!
I've known for three months that my mom was getting me a bigger TV for Christmas... can I just have it already so I can play black ops?
Seeing my stepdads family tonight. At least when I see my mom's family tomorrow I can get shitfaced.
Redid my hair. Sup mermaid life. 
*insert lyrics for Sworn In's entire Death Card album here*
@stephhdaniellee - "I heard that drastic hair change is the first step to suicide"
Why'd you have to go and do that?
Let it be known that nobody parties quite like @yunglungs 
Praise that I have classic Nintendo games on my phone.  Goodbye world, who needs friends.
If you're alive during the holidays and you decide to toy ship the day before, I hate that you're even allowed to breathe.
Can't get your xmas present till next month, but remember I love you @shaunamustdie &lt;3
I hate Walmart so much. Christmas too. Why am I stuck in toys all day and not even allowed in my department?
So like,  why do I wake up like every two hours?
Ya girl got the galaxy s5!
4 years ago today I got my first tattoo. Thanks timehop.
Live / breathe is wicked stuck in my head. Thanks a lot homie @JaydenPanesso
Anyone wanna bring me McDonalds? No? Ight.
@BrandonCTE no because no girls good enough for my little bro! :p
My boa hates my guts. He's in my lap probably debating whether or not to fuck up my leg.
@mikaylax exact same.
My sanity is nothing but a cheap whore.
There's not enough tequila rose on the planet for this shift right now.
@Nadi_uh I literally don't know how that happened!
@Nadi_uh and I might be alcoholics because it took us three days to realize we had each others IDs.
@mikaylax usually tweets the things I'm too lazy to type out. #props
So tired I can barely function.. So my coworker brought me tequila Rose. #thegoodlife
Getting the insides of both of my legs blasted by my buddy Mr. Fox.
Tattoo tonight because scumbag. Going to start working on my leg sleeves.
Permanently in the mood for Sworn In.
Wicked tired. But I can't sleep. What is this hoojank witchcraft?
@JaydenPanesso <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mikaylax go ahead and have one made for me too.
@JaydenPanesso omg I'm like your biggest fan! Omg, can I like, get a picture with you?!
@mikaylax I'm struggling so hard right now. So hard.
Squad up fam. @mikaylax @Nadi_uh @JaydenPanesso @yunglungs 
Had fun with all the homies last night... But that hour of sleep I got before work was lame af.
SYLAR is homies. Those guys are straight fam. Proud of you for not fucking up @Chrisfotch
@teo_utd @Nadi_uh @Chrisfotch noooo way! He couldn't hang, he's in bed already!
@teo_utd @Chrisfotch @Nadi_uh you know it
SYLAR is dope live though.
@Chrisfotch @Nadi_uh @teo_utd get stokeddd
@Chrisfotch @Nadi_uh @teo_utd duhhh nigg. I was saying because she was supposed to come with me last time
@Nadi_uh and I are going to chill with the homie @Chrisfotch , @teo_utd where you at?!
Moose is licking my face raw... Little rascal cat.
@Chrisfotch don't favorite my tweet but not text me back fam!
Open bar at Coyotes for our xmas party... A nigga is fucked up.
@Chrisfotch ight, get beat up when I see you Wednesday
Disgusted with myself, delighted with none!
I hate humans. Even more so, I hate the trust I put into them.
@Chrisfotch Bruhhhhh, why you blasting me though?!
I know when @Chrisfotch is having a bad day because he says really nice things to me... Pull yourself together homie
I can't wait to be off the next three days and wallow in the lack of friends I have with my cat.
It's nights like tonight that make me want to quit both of my jobs and move far the fuck away.
Fuck you tequila. My brain hurts.
@jyemenzies @Nadi_uh nooo way koala!!
We're the three best friends that anybody could have! @jyemenzies @Nadi_uh
I'm so fucking irritated. Walmart is such an ass backward, piece of shit company to work for.
Good news: I found my other opal nose ring, and my boa is starting to love me again. Yeee.
In the famous words of @tylerdennen , "blaaaaah, fuck"
@Chrisfotch just made my day by eating McDonalds in my honor! "This nugget goes out to bae" pahahahah
Me- "sharks are my spirit animal" Tim- "I thought it was a whore?!"
I just want ihop.

Calf tattoos... No bueno. Behind the knee does not feel good.
So there's a half taxi, half sheriff car driving around ocala?
Lost one of my opal nose rings. Sigh.
Everyone keeps asking if I'm single now... When was I ever not?
I have so much shit to do today, but I don't care enough to leave my bed.
Every guy I've ever liked has like negative liked me back. I suck.
I wish my redtail boa didn't hate me now. Wahh.
@jyemenzies anddddd we start back over with the lies. Honestly Jyesopher, pull yourself together!
@jyemenzies finally you're out with the truth. Now, doesn't that feel better?!
@jyemenzies it most certainly is not! Everyone should know the truth! <BOMB>
No one knows this, but @jyemenzies real name is Jyesopher.
Some people are such sluts to feel accomplished.
My life has seriously been so weird the last three days.
@Chrisfotch you suck! Lol
This guy just asked me if my plugs were a size 0 lol try an inch homie
Tonight was the kind of night I've been needing. The kind that turned my mood around, and maybe restored some hope.
@Chrisfotch if you don't answer your damn text messages!
The Death Card is a genius album, and if you don't think so you're wrong.
So tired. Do not want to work. I just want naps.
Woke up straight using my cat as a pillow... Sorry Moose.
COD till I k.o.
Really fucked up about this whole thing. Probably a lot more than I still should be.
Just bought The Evil Within... Goodbye world.
Hoodrat hair shit round two.
I need a Russian Bear Dog.
Oh and excuse me homie in the 2015 Lamborghini, but what the fuck are you doing in Ocala?
I swear i'm about to start calling Ocala drivers out by license plate.
Id rather be let down than be a let down.
Won five matches on black ops, so I guess I'll shower and get ready for class now.
Got a 100 on an art paper I wrote 40 minutes before it was due. Studious as fuck.
Haven't moved from my bed in like 30 hours. Swag.
My teammate right now sucks so much dick. Un fucking real.
This is hypocrisy! Practice what you preach, practice what you preach!!!
I forgot @jyemenzies was a koala until he just asked what a scrub was... Proving he's a scrub.
I shouldn't be allowed to play first person shooters and listen to death metal at the same time. Raging rn.
You are everything you taught me never to be.
I am at the maximum creep potential level currently.
Playing Black Ops II to some @SwornInBand . Brutal.
And if I ever cross your mind, make sure you write down the times, so I will know the moments I was eating you alive.
The saddest part about this whole thing is that I'm still willing to forgive you.
@jyemenzies @BrandonCTE I will give you nothing!!
@jyemenzies @BrandonCTE YOU TAKE IT BACK!!!!!
@jyemenzies @BrandonCTE you calling me a liar?!
Hit up @statusofmine from @AtTheBarr for sick threads. 
Lordddd only knows how many hours I slept last night but it was fucking great
@jyemenzies @BrandonCTE no way pugs are dumb :p
@Chrisfotch nigga turn off your phone and behave on your flight!
@Chrisfotch you still need to pull yourself together! Put on your bubble jacket and calm down!
@Chrisfotch can you please pull yourself together?
Still can't believe I cut out my dermal with a razor and tweezers.
After class, I'm going to cuddle with my cat and watch Once Upon A Time and not move until Wednesday. #bet
@AaronJMelzer don't shave homie, the flannels just wouldn't be the same
I've met @tylerdennen twice now at shows he's played with friends of mine, and all I can conclude is that we'd make splendid friends.
I can't handle how mushy and shit @HaydenTree is being lately, happy is a good look on you buddy!
The rednecks in this town literally make me sick to my stomach.
I slept 14 hours last night and it was fucking glorious.
I can't breathe. This sucks so bad.
My mother just said awesome sauce out loud... I'm done.
Sweet 4 hours of sleep and a hangover headache. Plus I ripped my dermal out last night with tweezers... Go me
Made good money at work tonight, but I'm fucked up. The price we pay I guess lol
I have a sour taste in my mouth with humans. Id rather be alone than keep being let down.
Giving up and letting someone else win will never feel any less awful. I just want to stop being sad. But I just had so much hope for us.
Heading to work, then working at the bar again tonight. If I don't get some sleep soon, my body my reject being awake.
I'm painting all words so you can never look away. I'm writing all the lines that you didn't have the guts to say.
I should be up getting ready for my second job, but I can't seem to get out of bed.
Just witnessed a grown man in shorts and uggs. #godbless
Worked 12-9 today and it was the longest day of my life. Fuck Black Friday so hard.
I fucking hate the holidays. Selfish cunts. I'm about to have an anxiety attack.
@iammichaelowens @jyemenzies @ImRichardRogers such good times guys
Hungover as fuck, but @Nadi_uh and I make a damn good team.
@jyemenzies @ImRichardRogers @iammichaelowens Richard and I still talk about this every time we see each other lol
Can we just @jyemenzies Lmaooo 
If this woman does not stop ignorantly popping her gum so help me.
Battery died on my brand new car. Missing class because I'm stuck at the dealership. My life is fucking retarded always.
@jyemenzies I doubt it!
Social media is so much cancer rn. Please.
Doing hoodrat shit to my hair.
@jyemenzies I hateeee you!! :p
@jyemenzies no you do not! Watch your mouth fucka!!
"I have nicely polished wood paneling on the inside"
Why are there old men doing business meeting at my break table right now? Proper.
"if I catch you in Walmart more than twice a week, you're not the queen you think you are" - Johnathan ... I'm dead!
@jyemenzies don't you scold me on twitter!!
@jyemenzies pleaseeee, I know nothing of the sort!
@jyemenzies YOU GOING TO MAKE ME?!
@HaydenTree is the literal worst when it comes to advice!
@jyemenzies noooo way!
I hate @jyemenzies and his generic snapchats!
@Chrisfotch dawh , I do my bess man !
@Chrisfotch rooting for you buddy!
@Chrisfotch happy birthday shithead!! I hope you get all the butt!
Doing a thing to my hair. Hairs covered in foil. I look super pretty right now.
Last week it was 33° , today it's 82° ... Cool fucking beans Florida.
For once in my life I thought that I was breaking ground. But the only ground I'm breaking, is the one that ends six feet down.
Is it bad that id always much rather be asleep than awake.
If you're in a public place and you cough without covering your mouth, I hate your fucking existence.
It's a good thing that I don't have friends who live here because I'm always so tired I'm like a blank zombie everyday.
@jyemenzies @BrandonCTE don't talk to my brother like that fucka!
@BrandonCTE I doubt it though!
I feel like I'm never not working.
@Chrisfotch wait whatttt?!!!
@Chrisfotch I'm actually happy to hear that, find better butthole homie!
And I'm here tonight, standing underneath the influence.
@Chrisfotch then it's been verified, you got booty from the most annoying female that's ever existed! Proud of you buddy!
@Chrisfotch dammit , I do have those ! Lmaooo what kind of secrets?! Be careful, I might find out you got the butt from that girl!
@Chrisfotch I don't think just instagram and twitter is all over homie lol oh the internets!
I've lost my head, I've lost my mind.
Glad to have my buddy @jyemenzies back though.
