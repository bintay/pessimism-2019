@htmIbabe #Savage
@roscoeswetsuit2 @NickEggplant dad?
I keep my feelings low key so that nobody knows whether or not I'm in love.
A movie should not be defined good or bad only by it's realism. If you enjoyed the movie, it a good movie.
*tells people not to see avengers because it's unrealistic* ITS A FUCKING SUPER HERO MOVIE WHATS REALISTIC ABOUT IT! It's an amazing film!
Blow a kiss, fire a gun. All we need is someone to lean on.

Nothing more I can say about Baltimore. Only this, I fear this sorta act will spread and will be closer than you think.
There are reasons why I don't talk about things like the Baltimore riots. Because I don't have enough info to back up my argument.
We live in a generation where people think they know everything just by reading one retweet.

Then work on casting for my movie.
Then I can start working on the StreetStreet Synths.
Looking for singers is difficult. Since we had show last week I think I found the right singer. Now to finish lyrics before recording.

Song of the day 
@ashwizzleB Fuquay Is way ahead of you.
@Dalliellama your a life saver. I'm downloading songs before I go to bed.
Hey @Dalliellama what was that song you played in the car?
When you leave your favorite pair of pants in @NickEggplant car. I'm sad.
Other than that the show went great. Till next time. I feel like I've connected with everyone this time. I love everyone in theater.
4 Nose bleeds today. 2 of them in front of actors. I'm so sorry for the actors and crew that walked in the bathroom and saw me bloody.
Maybe the roasting isn't a good idea.
Jenny wouldn't start so we told @Lanzo3 to leave the car so his bad vibe wouldn't make her sad. We got Jenny to start. Cars are emotional.
@samantha_bacosa I'm sorry. You guys made me nervous.
So this is a thing #Stormtrooper
When @Dalliellama answers the phone I'm kinda tempted to say Mom?
Everyone in fuquay trying to be a dj. I remember when me and @53var were the only ones.
@citizxen when I got the cup half a lemon was in it. I almost died. But it did help my sore throat. It's not as bad anymore.
@Dalliellama @JordanCrawfish it's just how we are.
@citizxen so my mom did the complete opposite and gave me really bitter lemon tea.
@citizxen okay. Thank you.
I really need some tea right now. My throat is killing me. Someone help?
Still trying to dj for you guys. I still have time to try.
@FVStudCo is there a possibility that I can dj next years prom? #DiskoverytoDJProm2016
@WhelanKaley I'm sure Elle wouldn't mind helping another girl out. Isn't that right @probablymorganw
@WhelanKaley have Elle Woods be your lawyer.
@WhelanKaley sue them.
@WhelanKaley have someone carry you.
@WhelanKaley but there's a ramp.
@WhelanKaley why not take elevator?
My sister weighs 66.6 pounds. No wonder I call her the spawn of Satan.
@RRand403 let agree that my mixtape is what started it all.
@hanniemarie2 looks like guacamole. Yum. XD
@JordanCrawfish haha I hold you to it. See you tomorrow babe.
Saddest part about tonight was that I didn't see @JordanCrawfish before I left tonight. Well goodnight Jordan. See you tomorrow. XD.
2 down 3 more too go! #UGOD #UsherGangOrDie #BowtieDontDie

You fuck with Nick, Duncan, StreetStreet, Anybody in theater, my family, Anybody I know and love you going to see the Mexican side of me.
Usher rule #1 don't say hi to the actors. More or likely they will not say hi back and you'll be sad. :(
@Cole_Fresh it's really good. And I love that alien reference in the background.
My boy @Cole_Fresh an Artist?! One of my favorite black and white drawings at the art show. 
I always feel like I'm annoying when I talk. That's why I don't talk a lot when with friends. Even the ones close to me.
Half of my family is getting sick. I have a sore throat but I'm sure it's from sing-shouting Tear In My Heart with @NickEggplant
@andreas0lis If dress code is bad at Fuquay then you should look at Harnett Central.
1 show down, 4 more to go. Let's do this. #UsherGangOrDie #UGOD
Everyone did great tonight. Legally Blonde was amazing. Can't wait to watch it again tomorrow. #UGOD #UsherGangOrDie
Got home to some bonjangles. I'm so grateful. Amazing show tonight! Can't wait to usher again this entire week.

Okay okay I'm done with the mixtape jokes. For now.......

@roscoeswetsuit2 You mean my life? A lot of people tend to get those confused.
Trying to explain to my mom what it means when your mixtape is fire in Spanish. It was hard telling her what turn up ment. Wish me luck.

@roscoeswetsuit2 @slade_pettus papi?
When you ordered sweet tea but got unsweetened tea. 
I wondered if people really think I'm making a mixtape. Had four people try to advertise me. This is hilarious.
Forgetting your wallet at @NickEggplant house. I hate forgetting things.
If you guys at Fuquay think that fire alarm was bad just wait till I finish my mixtape. That was just a taste.
Bruh.... 
@ithinkimliam of course. It was my mixtape.
@twentyonepilots birthday present.
@NickEggplant @BenThornewill @JordanCrawfish HEY GOT A HAIRCUT!!!!

@momo_jones21 I guess undercuts are called "Fuck Boy" hair cuts. Well time for a hair cut.
It's so easy to make fun of myself. Now I know why I was such an easy target back in the day. I'm such an idiot.

Listening to J Cole while trying to find a job.
@NickEggplant you read my mind.
I dont have a problem with the sync button if it's used to get out of a really sticky situation but don't use it all the time!?
If your a dj and you stopped using the sync button then you have respect. If not then we'll maybe switch out of virtual dj.

@Sammi_Bacosa10 @NickEggplant Let it be said what the headache represents,
It's me defending in suspense.

Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.

@BGRangel98i_00 Raphael got his face melted but wore a mask then entire series. And Donatello got shot and turned into a cyborg.
@BGRangel98i_00 exactly. Like they've done it before but they always brought them back. This time he's dead for good.
@BGRangel98i_00 I'm really fucking sad right now.
#RIPDonatello

Donatello just died in the comics. FUCK!!!!!
@htmIbabe wish I can do that everyday.
I remember the days where I went skateboarding after school with who I thought were the cool kids.  Yeah. Those were simpler times.

What a beautiful morning to be playing paintball. 
I think my mom forgot about me. Help!
PAINTBALL....... Pretty painful. But pretty safe.
Kinda wish I remebered her name. I would've asked if anybody knew her.
Two years ago I met a girl at a Wendy's. She was beautiful. All I know is that she goes to an all girl school. Haven't seen her since. :/
Alright call of duty. Let's see what you have taught me in my life. PAINTBALL!

Tonight is a very risky night to be joking around with people.
@DonaldNicholls 
My twitter is asking whats happening. To be honest, I don't even know twitter.
I remember, I sang the iron man theme for fun and I guess these kids heard and made fun of me for it. All those kids talk to me now. Crazy
@JukeboxtheGhost so I've been leaving these ghosts all over my school. And this is my latest one. 
@antmanf1998 praise.
This EP is actually turning out better than I expected.

@ImPockets @NickEggplant @yesIamwho <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> One day.
@WCPSS end of the year. Don't mess up Project X for the Ravers in Wake County.
@NickEggplant @yesIamwho 100% agree
@NickEggplant @yesIamwho Actually now that I say that Tyler James Williams does seem like a great Miles Morales.
@NickEggplant @yesIamwho Tyler James Williams could be one.
@NickEggplant @yesIamwho well I guess so. But considering that Donald is older so there has to be other options.
Okay Okay. So you know how we've been saying Donald Glover for Miles.  But what about Jaden? @NickEggplant @yesIamwho 
@roscoeswetsuit2 I wanna dj for it.
@roscoeswetsuit2 Ahh I wish I could go!!!!!!
@roscoeswetsuit2 What are you doing?
Why are most of my class mates getting arrested! This isn't cool.
@calabio197 @WakeMugshots WHAT!!!!!!
@itsjustnicol @FuquayVarinaHS @FVStudCo I should just do a EDM set. Just for the fun of it.
Gambino feel all day. Everyday.
@NickEggplant let's start a group called The Fruit Snack Clan.
@UnboxTherapy awake in North Carolina. Its 3:09 AM
My new setup is amazing.
I really want to meet @SuperDuperKyle we are to similar of a person to not meet. There's just one thing. I live in North Carolina. Yeah.....
@camstille No. Thank you for loving yourself and not being grey. Have a good night Cam. Tomorrow is waiting.
@superduperbrick I'd fly all the way from North Carolina just to seek medical attention from you Dr.Brick
@NickEggplant @DevinGabro Spidey for president.
@camstille Because if you don't have the love for yourself then what makes life great? Look for the great things in life. It'll be there.
@camstille Reach for it like you reach your dreams. With compassion. With hope that you can do anything because aren't down about yourself.
@alyssa_haynes3 bowtie's for life. <BLACK RIGHT-POINTING TRIANGLE><BLACK LEFT-POINTING TRIANGLE>
@alyssa_haynes3 but I can do that everyday. It's in my nature.
@alyssa_haynes3 Prom is for weenies. Might as well go to weenie hut Jr.
@alyssa_haynes3 you work at a prom dress store? Taking advantage of them discounts.
@BGRangel98i_00 @terrorstory props to you for scaring the shit out of me when my friends retweet you.
@BGRangel98i_00 it's scary as fuck dude.
I hate it when people retweet the terror Twitter page. I can never sleep after.
@EllettKaterina Summer's on its deathbed
I just lost a game of trivia crack due to a vagina question................
The more you scream, the more it gets worse. But sometimes screaming is the only option. 
Funniest moment from this weekend? Finding @NickEggplant sleeping in the downward dog yoga pose. Wish I took a picture.
You know. I'm happy that I get to see your smile. Your happy. I'm happy. Were all happy.
Looking back at old messages. Never cried so hard in my life. I was such a fucking idiot.
New logos 
@NickEggplant well find a hairstyle and I will study it before hand.
I just told my father that I want to study barbering when I go to college. He said he 100% supports it. Well part dj soon to be barber.
@NickEggplant when are you going to need a haircut man?
So many of you have changed drastically.
Im on a mission to draw @NickEggplant as Spider Man.
@Briana_Elboeck praise.
7th attempt. I don't think he noiticed. We are @themillfuquay 
@probablymorganw @NickEggplant I'm just trying to save humanity.
@NickEggplant @probablymorganw I'm not telling her. I'm just implying that sleeping for 11 hours is unhealty. I have a degree in doctry.
Heading to the mill. Then Taco bell. 
@probablymorganw that's hella unhealthy.
@htc The phone isn't even out and you already won phone awards 2015. 
@MKBHD EVERYTHING NEW! SHOW EVERYTHING NEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No Way!!!!!!!!! These two photos practically speak for themselves. Props to @MKBHD for the photos on snap chat. 
I'm in love with you _ _ _ _ _ _. But I dont know how to tell you. I'd rather risk it, than not trying at all. Isn't that what love is?
I try to set an example. But it's difficult when we don't know what's right and wrong. Open your eyes America! We have hope. I have hope.
You would know more about me, if only you all listened.
Worry about the people around you then your own desires.
There is no boundaries to my personality. I'm an open book to everyone. But I'm a libary to people who mean a lot to me.
Friends are your least priority. Make your best friends #2. Keep family #1. Even though they drive you nuts, you still love them; Always.
Having your best friends around is better than a fucking Corvette or a Lamborghini. they make memories last longer and make it worth more.
Don't expect someone to understand you if you don't understand them. That's like speaking Spanish to a man that only knows English.
Yay 
@DevinGabro @JordanCrawfish I'm on my way.
@JordanCrawfish @DevinGabro I don't hate you babe.
Hanging out with friends. Devin and Jordan don't have pictures. Sadly. 
@Emily_Grace416 I was going to say. You kids grow up so fast.

@David_X06 you know something wrong if you know her age and not me.
@David_X06 oops.
@David_X06 I think naty's 7. Is she not?
It's 1:12 am and what am I doing? Writing songs, producing beats and working on the script for my movie.
New logo? 
I feel like I've mad a few people angry. I'm sorry.
Don't you hate it when you about to shower then BAM! You have no hot water for the night.
Helping @DevinGabro shop for shoes and joggers because you gotta help a brother out dude.
It's makes me happy when I can talk philosophical with other people. That's a normal conversation with @NickEggplant and me.
Yo know it gets real when you and your 7 year old sister are rapping No Type.
I seriously want a beard. It'd going to happen. Jason butler will have competition if I grow a beard.
I'm so grateful for naps. And milk. I love milk. And Cereal. Tony the Tiger is my homie.
@alyssa_haynes3 standards.
@DevinGabro XD
@DevinGabro I thought it was amazing.
@probablymorganw @NickEggplant @roscoeswetsuit2 @adsears_ My mom just asked about the V. I told her and she said "you better be a virgin"
I try to talk to old friends. But get no answer. I guess that's apart of growing up right? Right?
So umm. Woke up hugging a cold pillow. That's the kinda night I had.
Raleigh at night is practically a death trap.

I think I have a concussion. I hit a soccer ball with my head yesterday thinking I was Mexican enough to play soccer.
I had the most emotional dream ever. It went from like normal day to hostile to tourture scene to normal to cruise to best dream of my life
I am experiencing a headache from hell.
My hair color reminds me of @_animum hair. Hahaha we both look baller rocking this hair cut. Am I right or am I right?!

Today I took 8 showers dude to the four times i bleached my hair + the application of brown. I fucked up my hair so bad the first time.
Brown hair success.

So no more blue hair.
This is it. I'm glad everyone liked the blue but I also think the fact that I had blue hair made me… 
Guys I'm sorry to say but my blue hair will be gone. But I'm going brunette.
So if interested contact me and I'll let you know about details.
I'm coming close to the end of my short film idea. I need a camera crew and cast. Not now I will announce soon when.

“@WaffleHouse: Friends don't let friends eat pancakes!” @NickEggplant Don't ever let me eat a pancake!
I finally changed my twitter user from an Of Mice and Men song to my stage name. Big things are coming.
I've said it before and ill say it again. Im a funny dude.
@_animum WHATCHU MEAN BOI!!!! You know its true. I look nice in a lot of things. You know this.
This guy came up too me and asked why my hair was blue. I gave him some bullshit meaning to life speech but in reality I really like blue
@_animum but I thought I looked cute in your hoodie?
@SuperDuperDevin wish I can live that life. But I'm still a mere child.
@SuperDuperDevin the life of an adult am I right.
Learning how to play This Is Gospel by Panic! At The Disco on the piano. Hardest song ever. Then again it's the first song I'm learning.
I should probably go to bed.
@kevowitdadro that's some Andy Warhol shit.
Okay I'm going to be straight up. If I don't reply to a message or call between the hours of 3:30Pm-10:00Pm I'm sleeping.
@callmetheUPSguy @slade_pettus you war hero.

@DILLONFRANCIS @Zedd Dillon feeling salty
Today is a sad day. My bow tie died today. I was in the middle of presenting a paper and then it's burst. :(
I still think the only reason I get rejected is because of my size. And yet sometimes it comes to that. Sorry that I'm a fat fuck.
Love is a strange thing you know.
You know it's kinda crazy that I still have the self confidence to ask girls that are way out of my league.
Tonight is Girl Scout cookie night.
When ever I talk about video games 3/4 of the people that follow me on twitter don't even know what I'm talking about.
@slade_pettus nice.
@slade_pettus @itsjustnicol z
@SuperDuperDevin @callmetheUPSguy @probablymorganw wanna hook a brother up.
@slade_pettus word on the streets is that you can hook me up with cookies.
@callmetheUPSguy @probablymorganw thanks for the intel.
IF A GAME IS MENT FOR NEXT GEN CONSOLES THEN KEEP IT ON NEXT GEN CONSOLES. IM TIRED OF MY ADVANCED WARFARE FREEZING ON PS3.

@probablymorganw do you know if they still do the door to door thing?
@callmetheUPSguy @WhelanKaley it's always been.
@NickEggplant thanks man. But I think I just need to chill and do just watch a movie or I don't know.
I have officially lost all my self confidence. Never leaving this house unless forced too. Fuck it. FUCK IT!
@ConnrTheCreator but let her pull down your pants
me: *tries to talk*
- gets ignored 
- gets interrupted 
- gets talked over 
- no one pays att…
So this is a thing? Listen if you can't pay for prom or get a date be like me and play video games that day. Simple. 
I don't remember going to bed last night but I feel a bruise on my eye now. I didn't go out last night?
@NickEggplant it's called logo logo on the AppStore.
@NickEggplant yeah. The guys that are doing the project x event made me a logo but it wasn't me so I just made this one.

@RRand403 like a girlfriend?
@_animum this kind of coke? 
@_animum bruh whatchu be doing in dem trails? Hmmmm
I don't know how you guys can hangout with friends or go out every weekend. I get homesick easily and I'm not far from home.

My sleep schedule is fucked.
@citizxen @callmetheUPSguy now I gotta find a computer. My journey begins.
@NickEggplant @callmetheUPSguy bruh......
Okay I want to salute the people that have taken English III and survived, that class is hard and it's only the first day of the semester.
@callmetheUPSguy can't find it. Didn't it use to be @SuperDuprDuncan
@callmetheUPSguy how did you change your user name?
@fortebowie man if you were still in Raleigh we could have chilled.
@samuelH97 Hibachi is never a bad idea.
Riff Raff going to warped tour? I'm so confused.
@citizxen story of my life.
I don't think my mom understands that I can do my own laundry. It's absurd.
I guess Harnett Central had like this 6 day vacation which is totally awesome but all of my friends have school so I'll be bored all day.
@JordanCrawfish <AUTOMOBILE> vroom
Wearing my new @MysterySkulls long sleeve I got last night at @LincolnRaleigh it was an amazing show. 
Before mystery skulls @NickEggplant and I took photos. Last night was awesome. 
Mission Complete. 
Happy Birthday you Sloppy Mcfloppy @ConnrTheCreator
Adventure to Chipotle! But first pit stop to Starbucks.
You know it doesn't hurt anymore. I'm not angry or depressed. I'm just sad. I just don't like the "R" word. Let call it ...... A Vacancy.
You know it's a good night when you spend 12.38 on 7 plates of food at Waffle House.
Hanging out with my best friend. Mystery Skulls tomorrow!!!!! @NickEggplant
@_animum I'd fuck with anything you do bae.
The only reason I ask for summer is because I hate having the heater on. AC for life.
@Laceygracee you never know what happens.
@Laceygracee I suggest saving every 15 min? Maybe 10.
@Laceygracee to 2/3 of the people that bought sims 4 experienced crashes and freezes.  Me calling it a broken game.
@Laceygracee are you downloading sims 4?
@Laceygracee props to you for downloading a broken game.
Playing Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 in class after exams. 
"they are these terrors. And it's like, it feels like as if somebody
was gripping my throat"
@SuperDuprDuncan Are you just figuring this out?
I just need to go to bed.
@DashieXP you know you can kill the birds in Far Cry 4 right? 
The more I write my stories the more I question my sanity.
@SuperDuprDuncan HAPPY BIRTHDAY Master!
@SuperDuprDuncan @probablymorganw agreed
@SuperDuprDuncan @probablymorganw I think I know. I mean ball is life that's my motto.
@SuperDuprDuncan @probablymorganw I think the correct term is player?

@WhelanKaley @RRand403 Nah it's about dat Mexican food. Aka tacobell and whatever my mom makes me.

I really really love this picture. 
“@TheTumblrPosts: I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE 

When our lives are over and all that remains

I believe that confidence is what separates most people from accomplishing a dream. Feel better about yourself than doubting if it's real.
Someone once told me courage is the key to success. Something's missing. Courage is not only the key to success but also Confidence.
I am a man of wisdom. I am a man of misery. I am a man of mystery. I am a man of wonder. I am nothing less a man with a history.
The more I watch Peaky Blinders, the more I realize that hipster dress like 19th century gangsters from England. I like that.
Peaky Blinders is an amazing show. I suggest this show to people that are into 19th century gangsters or just a gangster themed show.
@WhelanKaley your not 43? XD
@_animum @WCPSS so glad I go to different county's.
@NickEggplant Really?
@SuperDuprDuncan no Duncan. You make my day.
@NickEggplant how many retweets will it take for me to take you to the prom?
Have to do laundry because no clothes for tomorrow, also have to study for 3 exams. #FML #FuckMe
Woah throwback am I right? First show I ushered. @NickEggplant @SuperDuperDevin @SuperDuprDuncan

When in an argument use crude humor. Learned it from the master @SuperDuprDuncan
@_abaddoon same. I was almost a victim. But I got better. I'm glad things didn't escalate.
I think I won. Crude humor:1 Anger:0
@louisvutomlnson @_abaddoon #NoChill
@_abaddoon okay. I'm sure you understand how bad that was.
@_abaddoon @louisvutomlnson as long as she's done then I'm done.
@louisvutomlnson your a piece of shit.
If there's one thing I've learned from tv shows it's that they will fuck you up. Not just mentally but physically.
Thank you brother and sister for great taste music. 
“@PEDOPHlLE: When ball is life 
So I don't know why but everytime I change my color they always tie into @tyleroakley most of my family call me Tyler. Not a bad thing.

@jessreichh I take that back.
@CHERUBlamusica @MysterySkulls @LincolnRaleigh dude don't do this to me.

@Zedd @selenagomez 26 phone calls and 3 face times and nothing. Bummer. 
People think I cry a lot because my eyes get puffy or I'm always sleepy. Nope just non stop gaming and barely any sleep.
Being honest I'm afraid to talk to all of you guys except streetstreet because if I fuck up anything, I will fucking die. No doubt about it.
@JahovasWitniss what kind of hooker takes credit cards?
Your the reason I stay up every night.
So tomorrow I'm going to stream Outlast but on the hardest difficultly. Get a notification by following me here

How's the weather?

@WhelanKaley @WCPSS way to pull a Clint Eastwood. 
@WhelanKaley @WCPSS 
@Cole_Fresh Harnett Central got a delay.
My kinda mood right now. #RadioHead 
The thing I love about myself is that I can wear a bow tie and no one would care because I look damn good in one.
@_animum the last time I got good sleep was probably the night before the first day of 6th grade. After that shit went down hill.
I'm a funny dude.
@_animum more like no sleep: season 6
@_animum harnett county has a delay.
@notcherrry #Standards
@_animum @WCPSS PSA: the correct term for butt is buttock and the plural for it is buttocks
@WhelanKaley haha more like my body won't start in this weather.
Tbh if you think the whole delay thing is only in wake county think again. Harnett county has it too, &amp; our exams is Friday and next week.
@WhelanKaley @WCPSS they don't need a delay, they need a day off.
@_animum @WCPSS @poojanpmehta spitting hot flame.
@ConnrTheCreator @WCPSS we'll then. I'm just going to look the other way and be on my way. Good day sir.
@ConnrTheCreator @WCPSS dude you can't swear to them! They'll block you! XD
@_animum that's what I'm saying.
@_animum it's not really appropriate for a school district to have a twitter. But that's non of my business.
@_animum but isn't that how North Carolina talks,Very ignorant. And that my friend is called southern speech. I be roasting them.
@AnnaPinchukova @WCPSS but it makes me feel cooler.
@SuperDuprDuncan @WCPSS I wish I was Canadian.
@AnnaPinchukova @WCPSS I wish I was Russian.
@_animum why u say dat papa nick?
Dude!!!!!!!! 
COLDSCOPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SuperDuprDuncan that Jackson kid reminds me of someone. Hmmmmm oh yea Johnny.
Update. So I might move back to Fuquay but there's a catch. I might go to holly springs high school.
@jessreichh This is completely irrelevant but did you know your birthday is on a Mexican holiday? Also Happy Birthday!
Fuquay has no late arrival. Harnett has no power block. What bad thing is going to happen next testing next week? Haha. Oh wait.
Woah. I had huge hair back then. I really look goofy back then. 2011 on the left. #TransformationTuesday 
My worst fear probably has to be...... Being electrocuted. Fuck that man, that hurts a lot.
Actually can't get over my smile. XD 
People still ask me why I don't have a girlfriend. Don't remind me.
Felt pretty snazzy on the first day back on vacation. 
@probablymorganw same.
Really like this song. 
@SuperDuprDuncan it's too late for you.
@SuperDuprDuncan @shannonjolyons @NickEggplant @SuperDuperDevin @datfreeversedoe @theGreatZaksby oh it was.
I don't think my mom understands phone service.

Alright so will 2015 be better than last year? Probably not. Will it be the worst. Yeah maybe.
New Years with fam and friends. @MejiaBrayam

I know what I'm watching tonight. @Skrillex and @diplo at msg. #Jackü
You make me more upset than the first i got rejected. Oh wait you caused that! Then never mind. Still hurts after 4 years.

So guys.......That twitter hack though?
I went from following 770 people to following 199 people. DAMN!!
My hair will go from sloppy to neat in 5 sec. Proven fact.
Apparently not watching porn makes you gay? I don't see the logic in this?
@Skrillex 
@MejiaBrayam alright dude.
Goes to bed at 4 am....wakes up at 10 am. My sleeping logic is stupid.
@MejiaBrayam oh well then never mind.
@MejiaBrayam oh shit you drank? Nice. Yea dude you should come over on New Years.
For Christmas I'm just laying back, playing some advanced warfare while listening to @JukeboxtheGhost ah the holidays.

"Being a DJ is so easy i don't see why they are paid so much?" Would you like to try and not fuck up a single transition?
I'm really digging this edit. What do you think? @Skrillex @diplo 
@SuperDuprDuncan @itsjustnicol so wait birthday party confirmed?!
@SuperDuprDuncan @itsjustnicol okay. At least its only a month away.
@itsjustnicol @SuperDuprDuncan duncan am i allowed to dj? Not a big setup. Just table and speaker. No hardcore things. Just chill music.
@SuperDuprDuncan @itsjustnicol like the one were doing?
Someone please buy me a new ps3! Not ps4, ps3.

I always have these 1 day zombie apocalypse dreams. Is it a sign? No, i just have to take a break from Resident Evil.
@probablymorganw so how was The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies?
Thank you @SuperDuperDevin for my Secret Santa Gift!! I love it. #MerryChristmas 
The average DJ makes 345$ a night. Still think Dj'ing is a waste of time?
Yo! I need parties to DJ! Anybody having a house party hit me up! I don't charge a lot.
@SuperDuprDuncan you don't understand i just want to DJ a party again.
Disadvantage of having two brother Djs. One has the only laptop.
@SuperDuprDuncan unless you want me to play hardcore stuff.
@SuperDuprDuncan did you tell them its just me and i wont play hardcore things. Just calm edm.
@SuperDuprDuncan ill bring my laptop and mixer anyways.
@SuperDuprDuncan is the party confirmed?
i don't like it. My life
now i realize why i have so little friends.
Sometimes i really fucking hate myself.
Maybe eating 7 tacos and a chalupa wasn't a good idea. Stuck in the bathroom for 30 min. HALP!!!!
@SuperDuprDuncan your always my bae!
@SuperDuprDuncan @itsjustnicol its official!
All i want to do is sleep till 5 tomorrow @NickEggplant
@SuperDuprDuncan @itsjustnicol we will talk about it tomorrow.

@gameinformer 
@SuperDuprDuncan it was going to happen anyway.
White hair soon. Lets see if i can get it right this time.
@citizxen nah. It was hailing.
Apparently batman is invincible. Hahahahaha!!! Fuck That!
I also regret watching anything i get sent to in my email. God damn jump scares!
I regret life.
I've had people apologize for how they treated me when they were younger and I'm just like "It took you 13 years to say your sorry?"
Id actually do a lot of things other than drink alcohol. I fucking hate alcohol.
Id rather take acid than drink alcohol.
@citizxen brah were fighting. XD
@citizxen YOU HATE RAMEN!!!!!
Secret Santa's Christmas gift came in!!! 
Your feeling down but can still do things then I've got an album for you. #Gorillaz

8 days till Christmas and my phone's already wearing a Christmas sweater! 
@NickEggplant be patient. Your appointment is on Sunday.
People ask "Alex? What do you do at home when you don't come to school?" I simply say..... super smash bros.

@NickEggplant Yea my dad actually gave me 200$ to spend and i just decided to get new clothes. And my secret Santa's presents.
@NickEggplant funny how i just got new shoes too!
@NickEggplant Love you too man. I'm always here for you whenever.
@NickEggplant thats what makes you an amazing friend. Your personality. Not your knowledge or humor.
@NickEggplant What are you talking about? It doesnt matter whether your smart or funny. Its about you being you.
@NickEggplant okay. Do you have a back up to get to school?
@NickEggplant okay. Do you know what happened?
@NickEggplant wait really? Are you going to be there?
Dude my secret Santa this year is going to love his gift #streetstreetchristmas

@NickEggplant holy shit. You okay? That's scary as fuck
@SuperDuperDevin @NickEggplant @SuperDuprDuncan We ready for sunday!!!! Can i get a ohh yea?!

How in love are you with the coco?
Dude this new Bastille EP is on fleek!!! I love it @bastilledan
@TheAdamHawk @SuperDuperDevin it was one of my favorite songs by them. Till i sorta stopped listening them.
@TheAdamHawk @SuperDuperDevin yes.
I am 100% scared to ask you out.
I don't know why but i have a thing for amazing teeth, and brown eyes but that's just me. No biggie <OK HAND SIGN>
"@TheAdamHawk: What do you call a sunburnt penis? 
@NickEggplant my email really likes you. 
@NickEggplant k buddy
@NickEggplant when are you picking me up.
@NickEggplant kay bae.
@itsjustnicol ive got some things to tell you. Keep that frown upside down. Stay the same. New York is full of chickens. Happy Birthday
@NickEggplant this sunday?
@NickEggplant k. This friday?
@NickEggplant i gotcha, when do you want the hair cut?
@NickEggplant then okay.
@NickEggplant yea. You got sum clippers?
Okay so im not saying that not all clothing are high quality but holy shit! @PinkDolphinCo is super high quality. I love pink dolphin now!
Collaborating with @_StreetStreet_ is probably the best thing to happen to my career. New song ideas, genre jumping. Let do this.
@SuperDuprDuncan @NickEggplant @hanniemarie2 MY HAIR CUT!!!!  MY BEAUTIFUL HAIRCUT GONE!
@NickEggplant hahahahahhaha put a sticky note there and say what would ness do?
@NickEggplant also can I see the green mark?
@NickEggplant well yea but its goodbto know that your trying?
@NickEggplant you need to show me that. And I'll fix it.
Christmas is so commercialized, its not all about gifts. *5 min later*  oh thank you for the gift, wish I could have gotten you something
Am I the only one that showers with music?
I've been playing trivia crack for 3 hours straight. According to this I'm pretty damn good at science and history (THROWS FIST IN THE AIR)
@itsjustnicol anytime
@itsjustnicol no reason, chickens now and days love crossing roads. That explains New York City,  full of chickens.
@itsjustnicol hey I gotcha, why did the chicken cross the road.
FIGHT ME BRO!!!  (Aggressively plays multiple games of rock paper scissors)
Boy Oh Boy!!  Finally got Christmas shopping done. Well now time to work for that money back.
See looking to my yoyo I forget that I left it at @NickEggplant house. P.s. have you been practicing?
Now I have a constant fear that we have more mice in the house. Well time to clean this house.
Update I killed the mouse and woke up my family. Moral of the story,  always wear shoes when going to the bathroom.
5:30 am,  I go to do my morning business and what do I find. A fucking mouse. I'm going to kill it. Scaring the shit out of me.
I'm so use to @NickEggplant picking me up today but its break week. Till next week. More money, More Jukebox, More Smash!
I wish for one day I can stay quiet in class without being asked if I'm okay. It bugs me that I have to be energetic every day.
Well…… 
The reason Johnny talked shit was because me and nick had a Thanksgiving party and he wasn't invited. Yet he was basically inviting himself.
@ashlyn__angel @SuperDuprDuncan @citizxen oh  okay now that makes sense. Thanks guys.
@SuperDuprDuncan @citizxen yea did you see when he was talking shit about me?
Hate make up work. 
@NickEggplant Free Hair cuts?
The last three generations of the Nintendo DS. Cant believe the first DS came out in 2004. Feel old… 
@ithinkimliam dude whats your number.
Also using suicide as an insult is fucked up. Very grown of you to say that.
Funny how you delete all of the insults you sent me to make yourself look like the hero. Too bad I screenshot em.
@probablymorganw Bah Humbug!!
@ithinkimliam only because it was for me and our band @_StreetStreet_
@ithinkimliam here's the situation,  Johnny's mad because I said he could not go to a friend of mines thanksgiving party.
@ithinkimliam @_Jason_NC Thanks guys it really means a lot. @Zerconic you've brought this on yourself.

@llperiodauren I'll take your word for it.
@Zerconic but its cool man.
@llperiodauren I don't see what his problem is today. Apparently he is being grown.
Apparently this is being grown? 
@Zerconic we had to tell other people that they couldn't come either.
@Zerconic okay cool. Very grown of you to tell someone to kill themselves. Also overreacting over not coming to party isn't grown.
@Zerconic when you say grow up im being grown up. Speaking of which, have you grown up?
@Zerconic hahaha funny to know that you don't know measurement.
@Zerconic cool. Glad to know that. :)
@NickEggplant I really should have taken that other bag of chips and salsa.
@NickEggplant welcome
You like? @JukeboxtheGhost 
Oh yea let's not forget the kidnapping of fish. :(
