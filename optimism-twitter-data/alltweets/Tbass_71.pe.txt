Careful UNT friends! 
A five year old could write my lyrics and then I would have it made.
Seems that's what people buy these days<PENSIVE FACE>.
I could probably stop eating for 2 weeks, do some crazy stuff with my hair, and record an auto-tune heavy song about sex and get really rich
Seriously, everyone please be careful today with all these severe storms around.
@Gingeragin it's definitely part if it. I'm alright though. I've made some regrettable judgement calls. Life happens tho.
How many people have died so you have the right to stomp on that flag?
I'm pretty sure Harkins is the only place on earth where you can skip 5 days of work in 2 months for no reason and keep your job.
Surprised that didn't happen to me with the way things have been going. 
Ever go to the store, walk around, and completely forget why you drove there?
52 more servings of this crap.
If you have a mom that loves you, hug her everyday. Not just on Mother's Day.
I see you writhing in pain from all the hell that you've seen... You are not what you've done and this is not who u r 
Thank you.
Y u gotta use leg press for calves? There are calf machines sooo can you please stop being stupid and let me use the leg press?
Pretty sure tearing your acl on your first day if practice as a rookie in the NFL is the definition of suicidal depression. Poor guys.
@acerider67 plus twitter is sort of an inappropriate place to do that... I've put things on here I shouldn't have and I won't again.
@acerider67 lol. It's only a couple people that aren't on twitter... And it's really not me so much.
"Hell is still overburdened. I must stand and wait in line." 
I wish people wouldn't harass us about it. I never wanted that.
Last one "WHAT AINT NO COUNTRY I EVER HEARD OF!! THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT!?"
I could quote this movie all night.
Pulp fiction is such a great movie. Can never go wrong with it.

They used to hate each other. 
@Gingeragin out of the furnace is good too and if you've seen both of those, I got nothin.
@Gingeragin there's an indie movie called "joe"
With Nicholas cage in it. I was distracted by texting last time I watched it but it seemed <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Gingeragin u seen machine gun preacher with Gerard butler?
@Gingeragin I usually scroll a thousand times and then decide to watch a nature doc until I fall asleep. (Never takes long)
Pulp Fiction, Brave Heart, or Stand by Me? (not a chick flick if you don't know what it is)
@Gingeragin I'm really thinking about pulp fiction.
@Gingeragin i think transformers is like his only bad movie... And the happening. I'm having the same struggle as you rn.
@Gingeragin dude<FLUSHED FACE>... You saw it right? It was hilarious.
Just took my dog for a walk... It started raining so I picked up my 24lb "puppy" and ran home... Love adventures.
@Gingeragin pain and gain if you haven't seen it.
What even is "fit"? The 300 lb me wanted to be the 195 lb me and the 195 lb me wants to get down to 10% body fat. It's all about goals.
@Gingeragin @Corbin_Gant I'm still scared to touch something that tells me I'll gain weight<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Gingeragin @Corbin_Gant it's like 700 calories a serving so make sure you're active or you'll just get as fat as 2013 tristen.
@Gingeragin @Corbin_Gant I'm pretty sure syntha 6 is NCAA approved. If it's not, muscle pharm is good. ON also has a mass builder.
@Corbin_Gant yeah bro! Or both! I'm going on. Cruise the first week of summer but I should be pretty open after that.
@Corbin_Gant @Gingeragin if y'all visit this summer we should go to the lake or something.
@Corbin_Gant @Gingeragin I may try that after I can get rid of this last tiny layer of belly fat... Pisses me off.
I'm a protein geek. A lot of people don't know that but they do now.
@Corbin_Gant @Gingeragin the egg protein in it fills me up too so I don't want to like binge eat after working out.
@Gingeragin but I also just started lifting so that's kinda what happens. Definitely try it. I haven't tried chocolate so if u can sample <OK HAND SIGN>
@Gingeragin @Corbin_Gant yes. It tastes better for sure and has a solid ingredients list. It's just like twice as much. GS is solid too tho.
@Gingeragin I'll definitely let you know. I started with gold standard when I started lifting and I gained strength really fast.
@Corbin_Gant @Gingeragin combat is my life when I can afford it!
@Gingeragin I just got some because it was on sale and it has good ingredients. I've had the c&amp;c and it's good but vanilla is straight <PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL>
If you ever try ON's Gold Standard protein, get cookies n cream. NOT VANILLA!!!
That sounded pathetic but it's true<PENSIVE FACE>.
I don't hate you but letting myself get mad and feel the hurt was the only way I found to let go of my hopeless hope. Amity was miserable2me
I've experienced many things that involved quitting in some way or another and 0 of them r positive. At least if u try and fail, you learn.
When a friend says he's becoming more frat by the hour, it's time to have a come to Jesus talk with him.
I'm about to skip leg day and run on the treadmill just so I can watch Lord of the Rings.
You won't feel me til every body say they love you but it's not love... And your friends faded off shots of what you ordered to forget...<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><HEADPHONE><MUSICAL NOTE>
If you get a black stingray, you gotta put the chrome rims on it. Black rims on a black car looks the wrong kinda dirty.
Maybe they were already there.
Honestly, these last three and a half weeks of my life can go to hell.
Emotions have prompted me to tweet some immature things recently and I'm sorry.
Careful on the road. This guy in the left lane is drunk... And I'm on twitter.
I need to make this money before I leave but these blisters hurt so bad.
@AnnaJanczak THANK YOU!
WOOO! The rangers are on a win str-... Aaaaaaannnnndd they suck again.<UNAMUSED FACE>
Oh... So that's how you do that.
Today is a new day!
What the hell happened? It doesn't matter anymore but just wtf was that?
You still don't understand.
Just for the love of God, don't say things to me that you don't mean. Ever. I don't deal with feeling lied to very well.
I guess I've hurt this way since and I couldn't keep it buried anymore.
Hahahahahaha right because I wasn't hurt and I didn't trust you and you didn't choose this?
I'm not gonna play games.
This makes me so happy rn.
@goree_trevor I didn't look behind me and I tried to whip out of my drive way and smashed into his truck.
This person obviously doesn't know what happened last time someone blocked me in. 
@HannahOwen97 I'm trying. His pecs wave goodbye.
@HannahOwen97 u makin me wanna cry<CRYING FACE>
@Heissman11 no one ever knows who the O-lineman are. They don't get credit but signing a 1st round talent as a free agent is pretty good.
Definitely messed up taking a lineman in the third now.
If Greg Hardy gets his suspension reduced then it'll be a pretty good defensive line as well.
Well Dallas has the best offensive line in football.

(via @RapSheet) 
That was a start. It was nice.
@CoryHeiss14 for sure!
@CoryHeiss14 it's all good man. I don't know when we are going to go or for how long yet but you'll be missed.
@CoryHeiss14 fudge an I are gonna go on a road trip to Colorado to see Jeff. You comin?
There is a pit in my stomach.
Why rumors?
Why do people make assumptions about stuff that they know nothing about without talking to me first?
Sometimes what I really want is right in front of me but for some reason, I ignore it for something dumb before I go get it.
I'm sorry if I favorite everything.
I love when people have one another's back no matter what.
I'm sorry for my stupidness today. I shouldn't be allowed on twitter when I've gone 7 straight nights of getting less than 5 hours of sleep.
@Tbass_71 sometimes
Me at work. 
Why?
Wooo. I just read more bs.
Oh my God... So much irony. So much.
Okay Lesean McCoy... Chip traded you and replaced you with another black guy because he's a racist... Okay.
I love screaming babies too<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Dogs are always happy to see me
A lot of my tweets are just generally 19 year old trying to find a way in life related... Or annoyed with group work related.
@Tbass_71 no one cares tristen shut up.  Twitter sucks<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Only three friends because there are only three people that have stuck with me through everything since then.
I would cut distractions, have 3 friends, a wife named grades, and my best man at the wedding would be football.
I want to go back to freshman year and try again.
Unless you're just a blissfully ignorant person, it's waaaayyy too easy to smell bs when words don't line up with actions.
@Tbass_71 #sarcasm
I just love when people try to bs me!<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@acerider67 hahaha lol. I'm not rich either. I'm just saying there are a lot of people in this world that would think I am. I suck at golf 2
LOL. I'm kinda making myself feel worse because my worries are so insignificant to those of others in other parts of the world.
I'm rather confident that I'm not going to die in a fire fight today. God bless.
At least I know that I'm going to eat today. I have a bed and a roof to go home to. I'm freakin rich.
Must... Stay... Positive...<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm catching a bad case of the "alone in concessions with only thoughts" feels. Text me if you wanna talk. 
It's kind of scary how that happened.
Things went from so good to so bad and I don't even know why.
My mouth says "grilled salmon steak with a shrimp cocktail and a garden salad." My wallet says "get a sandwich bitch."
@Tbass_71 your*
When you don't have you're usual work belt so you try an old one on and forgot that you lost 100lbs. 
For the first time in a while, I'm actually really excited to work today. The schedule says I have some cool ppl to hang with tonight.
Anyone ever just write down what they want to say, read it 3-5 times, then throw it away and feel better?
All I need is a bass that knocks.
This dude is tryin hard to sell me testosterone supplements... <NEUTRAL FACE> like does he realize that I'm a 19 year old male? I have enough of that<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.

I'm tired of being at work. 5 days in a row is more than enough... It's gonna be 6 tomorrow<CRYING FACE>. Love my job but I'm exhausted.
The struggle of trying not to watch the avengers on a dead Monday night.<TIRED FACE>
@acerider67 idk. That's why there needs to not be a 2nd movie.
@acerider67 nah man. The first John wick was perfect.
@acerider67 I know. I don't want them to break it.
It's good to feel good again. I love my job, my family, and my friends beyond words. I'm blessed and I can't say enough about them.
I'm have pretty much fallen in love with these new era NFL hats... Like I'm thinking about buying all 32.
If you draw breath within the borders of the U.S., cheer up and be happy because most of the world would literally kill to be you.
Also, if you're a friend and want to go, text me and we will set up a savings account together. This is next summer. 
No music today. Just the birds.
Why do I worry so much about now, when God has always made things better for me in the future? Things come and go to make you grow.
I guess I'll get this out of my system now... MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>... I'm sort of ashamed now<PENSIVE FACE>.
I love when people encourage each other. I love my friends to death. They bring joy and comfort beyond description and keep my mind clear.
Sometimes, I feel like my unwillingness to create unneeded drama in my life bores people and that's sad.
"If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything" #latenightquotes  I'm so tired but can't stop thinking.
Slowly realizing how stupid I was.
You know, tbh, I don't feel like avengers has been as hard as working American sniper.

@Byron16Jump is going to be ready because he'll practice against the most physical and competitive receiver @DezBryant
@Gingeragin Doug Free is old and injury prone... And has sucked until last year.

Nah my shoe ain't Gucci but I'm Gucci with the shoe.<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Dallas... Y U no draft Jay Ajayi when he falls that far to you?
This is that time of year when I think about football 90% of the time and the rest of my thoughts are mistakes.
Just chilling, listening to music, and having good conversation is nice. People need to learn how to take it easy sometimes.
Well... The real rushes of the avengers are about to begin. Good luck to everyone everywhere, who works at a movie theatre!
I hate trains.
You know, fine dinning, Mayan ruins, swimming with dolphins and stuff. So close.

@acerider67 I have professor McIntyre at the northwest campus
@acerider67 mine asks that too. I kind of keep my mouth shut now because I'm apparently way too opinionated for college lolz.
@acerider67 quote
@acerider67 and everyone's solution is and I quite "to make it easy for violent criminals to get jobs."
@acerider67 true. We learned that 80% of people in prison didn't finish high school and half of them were unemployed when they were arrested

How many times do I have to tell trivia crack that I don't like it before it stops asking me to rate it?
My eyes are irritated af rn though. Wondering when I'll be used to these contacts.
Today is overall just much better than yesterday. Things make more sense.
I would love to go fishing and listen to some music but this weather is telling me no.
Wow... I haven't been this tired in a long time.
@Gingeragin you can also grip a weight to your chest to make it harder. My lower back is dead after these so have fun.
@Gingeragin 
Just so everyone knows, if it's not marvel or Disney or a hunger games type movie, there isn't anything after the credits.
The movies over. Please just leave.

@acerider67 dang. It probably will and then I'll regret not letting it bite me<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@acerider67 yeah. I have been feeling rather forgiving recently and I spared it's life. Hoping it kills Mosquitos and not people.
@acerider67 "that could have been bad."
@acerider67 haha no. I am walking by myself and I was too lost in thought to freak out. I sort of just brushed it off and was like "crap."
Well I almost just died. This thing dropped on me and I'm pretty sure it's bite would be bad.

I wish I could turn the caring off.
I'm convinced that music and real friends are the key to survival and sanity in this world.
If I'm having a tough time, I would always rather work out, pray, or take a walk than smoke or drink. I'm trying to learn, not forget.

@ATLienPierce is that what you do to get your mind off the terrible falcons?
@ATLBornn @ATLienPierce @CoryHeiss14 @Heissman11 @xo_go_  the only reason they said no catch was cause it was at Lambeau. Refs were scared.

Please stop putting Iggy on the credits of movies. How on earth is she famous!?
I'm really not in the mood to pick up after people today.
Vibe. Killed.
Group work sucks because it makes me give my phone number to people that I don't want to have it.
No good movies out until the avengers<UNAMUSED FACE>
To the first female ref in the NFL: Your answer to only one question matters in my support for you... Did Dez make the catch?
Dad brought Asian food.

@AnnaJanczak I've been working on that for a while. It is impossible.
Believe me when I say that I have the utmost respect for out police and am not "anti-cop" but I can't justify this. 
Person: what kind of music do you listen to?

Me: yes.

@Tbass_71 it's right up there with stepping on a Lego.
Other than crucifixion and child birth, I don't imagine that anything is more painful that puppy teeth sinking into a bare ankle.
That weekend has got to get here soon.
Sometimes<WINKING FACE>
"Say you're okay. I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away. Fight the pain. It just feels like forever is crashing down on me."

Hey twitter, why are you tweeting things that I'm not saying?

I wonder if one of these old guys will let me fish for them while they go to my class.
I felt like the luckiest man alive but now I know it. My lifting partner dropped 180lbs on my foot yesterday and I don't even have a bruise.
Almost... Done... Ugh...
So y'all say my facial hair makes me look like a Mexican a week ago but now you say I look like the Wolverine!? I see how it is.
Sometimes you get so impatient that you just wish openers didn't exist.
My boss, Mr.Fermier: where are you going?

Me:A concert.

Him: Are you bringing lots of cocain?

Me: No.

Him: well it's not a REAL concert.
5 hour energy before work is looking more and more likely as every moment passes.
@dallascowboys it doesn't put the cowboys in a tough spot. It leaves us where we've been since we had him. Look at the picture! He sucks.
@nflnetwork watching top 10 #12s and y'all have Jim Kelly above Roger Staubach... Y'all are smoking more weed than Josh Gordon.
Oh my God! Is that fresh cut grass that I smell? Heck yes!
I appreciate the occasional "turn up" track but music from the heart beats music from the club every day forever.
So I just got home and my garage door is wide open and no one else in my family is home... If I get murdered when I walk in, I love y'all!
@devinGilliam73 happy birthday bro! I miss ya man!


So I just checked the announcements and there isn't anything that says class got cancelled... I wasted 2 hours if it is.

Happy birthday, Peyton Manning. 
@samantha__brown God bless! you're welcom<FACE THROWING A KISS>
I just want my dog man.
Wow! This is a beautiful Monday! Have a good week everyone!
Can we stop giving Michael Sam all the press. So he's gay. He isn't good enough at FOOTBALL to play NFL ball idc how bad you want him to be.
So when my body says "no, you took a nap today. You can't sleep." I answer by prepping everything for tomorrow. #lame 
I know! Let's make an iPhone case that's water proof but won't let you plug any headphones into it except the earbuds that come with it!!<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>

When your boss let's you leave an hour early because he knows you close-open<RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
So you say you gone be 10 minutes late to start and now you're late for being late... Wtf man.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
For some reason I can never write effective papers unless I do it at midnight the day before it's due.
Can Dallas just hurry up and sign Greg Hardy already?
Enjoying this fine afternoon, listening to some good ol' country music and wearing a baseball cap. Am I a dad? 
@samantha__brown the beeping is always there... It never stops<FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>.
@samantha__brown 
Anyone else see mount doom in this? Or am I just too weird? 
See look. All I wanted was a little time to see if could still do 10 laps without stopping. Was that so hard? (Answer is no. I need summer!)
And the funny thing is that no one gives a damn<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> why is twitter?
Well maybe not because the outdoor pools are 50 degrees and I'm not about to share a lane inside... Fml.
Wow... I'm actually going to swim tonight<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Really didn't know how to feel about Kendrick's album the 1st time I heard it cuz it wasn't what I expected... It sunk in now and GOOD GOD!<OK HAND SIGN>
Love how I get the announcement that class is cancelled as I walk in the school doors.<UNAMUSED FACE>
I still get excited when I hear the ice cream truck.
Dear leg day,

Please quit being so necessary. I hate you.

Sincerely, Tristen.
Just caught a 3lb Bass but he fell off the hook as I was about to take him off and he flopped back into the pond... I never got to hold him<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@ATLienPierce we never praised him. We all said thank God for that O-line
@ChipKellyJr @ATLienPierce @DeMarcoMurray

The eagles are WAAAYYYYY overpaying for a back that doesn't fit their system like shady did... Oh my god<UNAMUSED FACE>.
I love you @BSNSupplements
#NowPlaying "Yours Again" by Red from of Beauty and Rage 

I love when an artist puts so much heart into a song and… 
The Ohio state national championship video shows exactly every reason why football is the best sport on earth.

The eagles and 49ers are toast this year.
Julius Thomas to the jaguars... Like... I don't know what to do with myself this off season... Is everyone in the NFL stupid?
#adventures 
Ever think to yourself "what did I do to deserve all these amazing people in my life?"
Maybe I don't tell you about my life because all you do is use that info to control me... #parents
@haibail tomorrow then!
@haibail pain and gain!! It has marky mark and the rock in it! It's pretty funny but will make you like "wtf" (if you haven't seen it.)
Pretty sure I have a caffeine addiction<LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I may need an intervention soon.
So much good football on twitter right now!
@Gingeragin buffalo now is a legitimate threat to the patriots now.
@AdamSchefter @JSpiegel2 OH MY GOD!!! I couldn't be happier as a cowboys fan... Wow... Bye bye shady!!
@wfaaweather nooooooo!!!! When is the sun coming out?! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Dallas.... Don't pay Demarco Murray! Just draft Melvin Gordon or Todd Gurley and lock up Dez long term. <AMERICAN FOOTBALL> ain't that hard.
When you want to go somewhere but gasoline tells you to wait until Friday.<CRYING FACE>
When your boss scares the soul from your body. 

Guys!!! It's supposed to be 70 degrees tomorrow!!!!
@AnnaJanczak same! I freakin vibe to that song!
Can't go for a walk, can't play outside, can't go fishing, can't do anything really except drink coffee inside and I'm gonna go crazy.
Just realizing that I'll be nineteen in about a month... Crap. I'm going to be one hundred before I know it.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Haha that was this weekend at work<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
God I hate myself right now... I just want to sleep for more than 2 hours at a time!
Who cares what color that dress is?
@Gingeragin you're way better than Andy dalton
@getthecanon hey man! How are you doing? Are you fully recovered and has your recent incident inspired you to write a lot?
@TheSexyVehicles @jdarne41  hey! You wanna get one? Well split the cost and we can switch off driving it every week! Hahaha
I feel like I just ran my legs through a wood chipper.<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@wfaaweather would you expect school in Keller or south lake tomorrow?
Throw back Thursday to when I met that perfect girl samanthathebrown who took this perfect picture<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

I'm mourning for my recently washed car<CRYING FACE>

@samantha__brown Samantha, we still have to drive to work on Friday<GRIMACING FACE>
@kathryngreyyy @goree_trevor  it's all about money. They get paid for every ass that's in their seats and they already lost two days of it.
@KellerISD that's stupid by the way. I hope you enjoy that government funding over the safety of people like my sister.
*Almost slips and dies walking out the door* thank you schools everywhere! I am now going to risk my life so you can have your money.
Thanks @Drake for the new workout song!
