It's this time of year that I am unbelievably grateful for all the love and support around me. I may not show it, but please..
But this happened at work in Sunday and I just found it again and now I'm laughing 
Being sad also means getting drunk by myself
Everyone can just go away

@frangibleheartt sowwwwwwy Christie:( BTW WHERE YOU MOVIN??
I quit montanas a year ago today. Side note
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head.
through a hard time, could not have given a shit about people like me who have gone through moments of contemplating ending their life.
And trust me. I've dealt with my fair share of hardships, and all these people saying that they will "be there" for anyone going-
Too bad half of you don't give a shit about how 1 in 3 people around you suffer from depression, anxiety, bi-polar disorder etc..
Today is when people can make themselves feel better about themselves for "ending the stigma" of mental illness.

Woulda been cute if it weren't for the leafs hat <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Pasta or soup for dinner..
My room's all cozy and warm and smells like apples. Someone come cuddle.
I shouldn't let this stuff get to me but I am
Hi give me good movies o watch because i need a break from greys
@BrettCullen4_ it's okay, because I got offered a raise and promotion today so they can suck it
Why does MY sexuality need to be a workplace conversation, especially behind my back. I'm not a "huge dyke" #icanhearyou
Let's try that tweet again
I miss being able to do pony tails. Now if I do it, it looks like I'm trying to pull off a man bun.
Nts: renew healthcard before your birthday
If you never break you'll never know how to put yourself back together.

I have actually been sitting here debating on it for like an hour because i didn't go grocery shopping yet..
to order pizza for dinner or not..
Now i'm lucky if i even brush my hair
throw back to when i wore makeup everyyda because i actually gave a shit about what i looked like
Do I need whiskey to start fueling my complaints? People love to drink their troubles away. Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off that way
What are some good hand creams?! My hands are so dried out from work, and keep cracking..
heaven on earth with a new fuzzy blanket and space heater. I love my life
No more freezing my tits off! Dis bitch finally bought a heater for her room
Can we act like we never broke each others' hearts?
I was going to go out today but too comfy now
Man my body hurts..
@Popmaster155 i work too much but not enough. Can I just get paid to watch netflix all day??
@Popmaster155 too bad i work an over so i'll be there for a million and a half hours *kills self*

Do I just get up and shower.. Will it make me need to sleep
@Popmaster155 I was going ape shit because a) my day off b) nothing to do
@Popmaster155 legit got called in for 3 hours because we were being audited.. We had 5 people working in a damn morning shift
@Popmaster155 praying I don't get called in on my day off again.. #auditproblems
@Popmaster155 Monday and Saturday bruh

So much for being able to sleep
@VulcanTokes FUCK.... YES
@VulcanTokes LEGIT. And side note: creeping... DOLLAR STORE BESIDE FOOD BASICS?? NO MORE TREKKING
@VulcanTokes tbh idk whats worse, the people that brag about smoking pot, or the people that don't that need to remind you all the time
spolied myself and bought new plugs #isaidiwouldntstretchup
I mean, I know a lot of people with very short hair that don't like girls. So don't just assume shit the first time you meet me..
Just because I have short hair doesn't mean I'm some raging lesbian
I had the most amazing nap today after work, I just woke up and I feel like I could sleep for another year or so
"You're my person"
I enjoy puking on my way to work on my day off...
Pizza and Grey's date by myself. Okay
On a side note: going up to 5/8ths soon
I'm tired of being a backup person for everyone..
I mean, what if they missed something? Or it turns into something else? What if I have to take time off work..
Although I have been told that my cysts are clearing up, I still have a constant worry in the back of my head.
Realizing you don't have anything to pay with your pay cheque &gt;&gt;
Finally getting trained on opens. Goodbye close shifts <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
@Popmaster155 just read to use dawn instead if laundry detergent
@Popmaster155 you understand my pain &lt;3 like I have no choice since I have to pay to wash my shit
@Popmaster155 I still have the oil stain from when I got burnt... I wash it everyday
The day I learn to get the smell of fryer oil out of my uniform will be a good day
I want a friendship like Meredith and Christina
ALEX GOT SHOT WTF
"Pick me. Choose me. Love me."
@Sarah__14 true dat
I've seen so much today that has made me miss you more. But I fought for you and it meant nothing to you. It's time for me to move on.
the microwave just went off but i'm too comfy to get up to get my food..
My hands are legit peeling..
I need to shower but I'm so warm in bed <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
00's #1 hits &gt; everything
And my co-workers are some kick ass bitches and can cheer me up in no time xoxox <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Because all my friends just fucking forgot about me.
Kinda sad that I talk to my co-workers that I've known for 3 months about my problems more than anyone else.
New tattoo or chest dermals idek

other 50% of me: "i love tattoos &amp; hardcore music &amp; concerts &amp; ‚Ä¶
You are the horrors of my past.
GEORGE IS DEAD... WHAT
Stressing because Grey's
32 hours 45 minutes this week.. Can I sleep for a week?
9 hours and 20 minutes later, I'm out of this bitch
Still my favourite thanks to DJ 
"The only time I set the bar low is for limbo"
Shh the goats are calling me
All I want is a little respect.
Finally going to buy stuff to decorate my room today
In the next few years, Winnipeg, Prince George, and Lethbridge/Piapot are in my travel list so I can go and see my bestfriends.
It's just about decided: Becca will be taking a trip out west very soon!!
I give up
So tell me what's so wrong with me 
that you could leave so easily.
My head is pounding and this traffic is stupid
All I ask is for me to not be hurt anymore
Maybe this is what I deserve
@VulcanTokes leaving macs:)
@VulcanTokes okay, just let me put pants on and go to macs. Ill message you when i get to macs
@VulcanTokes im so serious...
@VulcanTokes can i just come join..... i think im in need of a drink
So i think this means i sit in bed all night and listen to brand new
Can't stop crying and shaking b/c sad
I can't take this.
All I want is something sweet but it's not worth it to hike in this weather
Fuck this.
Being near @Sarah__14 everyday but never going to see her sucks #missmysister
David and I will be the same age for like.. 5 months or some shit like that
But damn do I ever wish that I was still in highschool and didn't have to worry about being an adult.
I'm at a point where I don't care how far away I work. I care that I get the hours I need to pay rent and live.
Made my dinner for work tonight. That's a step up
@Sarah__14 <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
Like I'm sitting here crying at this episode
I'm so emotionally involved with grey's
Tempted to get my chest dermals done again..
If I got proposed to in the jewellery store, I would say now #sorrynotsorry
@Suptayluh OMG YES

@Suptayluh a bought a pair at winners forever ago and they got stolen:(
@Suptayluh they are legit heaven <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
priorities straight. Don't ask me to pay for you to get home if you just spent $10 on something you don't NEED.
Like don't come out of a store with a brand new pack of smokes and ask me for money to get on the bus to get home. Have your damn -
Also.. PRIORITY. If you're on a limited budget, fucking have your priorities straight.
-1 out and I sweat my balls off walking home with groceries.
you to sit on your ass all day.
Like if you just want to sit on your ass and do nothing, cool. Just remember that some people have to work their asses off to pay for -
If you ACTUALLY need government funding, go for it. If you're too lazy to get a job and abuse the service, than fuck you.
I understand the idea of welfare.. But do I have a rant about it.
Coffee stop before grocery shopping is much needed on a Friday afternoon
Here's this thought, some of us are trying to pay rent today. Be in your fucking office
Huge s/o to my friends for just forgetting I exist..
Gotta pay rent and go to the bank and go grocery shopping today but so cold
David's chicken wings were more important than our second New Years. OKAY
Dear play station controller.. Stop turning off, I'm just trying to watch Grey's
Sad because slept on the couch lastnight. Drugging up so I can cuddle tonight.
That arrow quote has a whole new meaning now #reminiscing
Update: I finally got my potato salad
Being woken up by a sharp, stabbing earache is always fun
But too bad when I went to put my automatic air freshener up, it sprayed me in the face..
My room smells all summery now and not like vanilla. It's nice.
Waking up this sick means David and I are spending New Years sick together!
Why have I not been watching grey's forever?
Still want potato salad. Being me some.
People that complain about being an adult but still live with their parents and don't pay for anything.
@tr1ppyprincess in each but is now taking up 2 dryers. I have one load in a dryer an the other has to wait till her shits done..
@tr1ppyprincess just be thankful you dot need to share 3 washers and dryers with an entire building. This woman has 2 loads with 10 things-
You have two loads in washing machines with MAYBE 5 things in each.. And you need to take up 2 of the dryers?
@tr1ppyprincess legit my attitude towards everything lately. Especially doing my laundry right now
dear god because i got high came on and now i'm crying because DJ.
@tr1ppyprincess the struggle of lazy mondays..
does rum and sprite taste good together? Too lazy to go get coke
listen to 00's #1 hits, smack that comes on and all i can think about is @VulcanTokes  why??
when is it acceptable to start my birthday countdown?? @Sarah__14
fucking smacked my hand off the door frame and now i cant move my hand, alright
I'm not ready for this.
Left my apartment and questioned myself why I would wear makeup to this because I know I'm going to cry
That was just down right disrespectful..
Today I say my final goodbye to someone who helped me through so much..
I have made $225.50 in 2 days <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
Got judged for walking into Timmies with my work uniform on. The struggle
DJ wouldn't complain if I wore vans right?
I need to find something to wear tomorrow but idk
Random thought: I should probably get my smart serve
2014 was good until about October. Concussion, oil burn and loss of a friend in just 3 months. I'm hoping 2015 will be better..
I want a cat. But David's allergic to them <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Oh but the funniest thing about Christmas was that @Sarah__14 filled my box with cotton balls and I cried <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@frangibleheartt your cat is adorable omfffg
Why do people feel the need to spray half a bottle of perfume onto themself... My stomach is turning now
Like there are a lot of families in this world who can not get pregnant, but all these people just pop kids out like its a job.
@BrettCullen4_ sadly a lot of people I know summed up <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> its so bad..
If you're woman enough to open your legs and continue through a pregnancy, you're woman enough to look after your own child.
I mean, if you're man enough to stick it in her, you're man enough to look after a child.
I'm so sick of seeing all these dead beat parents..
@VulcanTokes an extra 132 on my pay cheque ya feel. Thank goooood for time and a half
Work 8 hours today, getting paid for 12 <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
If your love was a mountain, I swear I'll climb to the top.
I give a huge shoutout to bigger girls that aren't ashamed of their body. But know how to dress your body.
Like sorry but you aren't taking the one good thing in my life away from me.
You're not getting him back. Lol
Thanks to my sister, in going to start a photo collage on my wall:3
@tr1ppyprincess Buffalo Wild Wings :) (so way out there-.-)
@tr1ppyprincess ugh yes!! Like I worked yesterday, than friday, Saturday than a few days off than like Wednesday to Sunday-.-
@tr1ppyprincess finding a free will suck because working in a restaurant during the holidays sucks but yes!
I love that little girl, and she cheered me up so much the other day crying for me omg
Getting the picture of David's neice with the sweater I bought her honestly put the biggest smile on my face
@tr1ppyprincess legit... Like why have we not even got together yet..
@tr1ppyprincess creeping you but this is us summed up <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Lip chap, hand cream, socks, and a new computer. Okay!
now to transfer all my stuff to the new computer.. if my other one will even turn on
S/o to my parents for always giving us razors, socks and underwear in our stockings
10:40 and already crying.
I have a tiny dog and she's taking up more of the bed than i am.. Really Minnie
How David puts up with me and my mood swings lately is against me <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Hope you two have an amazing Christmas up there <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è #rip
Can't get to sleeeep
Yes dad. Let me drown my problems with rum
I'm really not in the Christmas spirit..
Coooooooooooooooooooool
But instead, you get pissy with me and fall asleep.
But cool. Not like I've been stuck at your house all day alone or anything. Not like I wanted to spend time with you.
Wow whatever
Here's to hoping I can get Sunday off for the memorial service.
Btw i'm serious. I'm starving alone
Someone bring potato salad to David's house thx
Being alone at your boyfriends house for most of the day is awkward
It's been a rough two days..
Someone bring me something to make me fall asleep
I'm not even tired..
I keep re-reading the email and crying even more. I can't get myself to delete it..
I've held it together for a few hours, but I really can't cope with this. Here comes a sleepless night filled with tears.
Finding out about a friends death is the worst.. But thanks to my managers for allowing me the night off to relax.
My heart hurts
I suck with death.. So this is hell.
I have to go past DJ's apartment to get home.. Here are more tears.
I will always think of you when I don't feel like going to work..
So thank you DJ for all the smiles, and pre-shift chats. I'll miss you more than anything. I hope you rest in the sweetest peace <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Always hold your friendships close. Be nice to your co-works. Give them a smile. You'll never know when they'll be gone.
I like spoiling @Sarah__14 for Christmas. Whoops
I mean working the holidays means time and a half but it would be nice to see my family more than once over the holidays
Guess who works every holiday this year.. This girl <DISAPPOINTED FACE><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
@Popmaster155 I work in an hour.. Fawk me
@Popmaster155 xl coffee in my hand and big redbull in my bag. I'm readdddy
@Popmaster155 I live off of coffee and redbull for any shift before 3pm
@Popmaster155 LOL. And since I wake up a few minutes before I have to leave for morning shifts, breakfast courtesy of Timmies is legit
The fact that it's normal for me to eat breakfast on the bus scares me.
Today would have been David and i's one year, whoops
Creepy dark bus
And ontop of that, I forgot y pay cheque at work
Thank god my parents got me a new computer this year
Started crying because my computer wouldn't turn on.. But it had to be plugged in to work.. And it wasn't..
Forever getting sick right before Christmas
Fryers on win night... Nope
"It tastes like cock and balls" - My boyfriend about strawberry flavored water
Murica bound with David:3 (praying I won't hurt him on the way)
Already set to go to bed and I haven't even started work yet.
Holy migraine batman
So thanks wade for making me realize the good.
He makes me smile everytime I go in there and has made me realize that I'm lucky to have a job, and I should love it.
There's one guy at the Timmies that I go to that is always so happy and just seems like he loves his job.
@VulcanTokes worth doe
@VulcanTokes well duh bby <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Kinda excited to go to the states this week now that I have money to spend on ME and not others or rent.. YA feel?
@VulcanTokes I may need to watch is all the time now
@VulcanTokes I'm sitting here in tears because this movie is so perfect
LET IT GO, LET IT GO. CANT HOLD ME BACK ANYMOREEEE
I know the words to the songs but this is the first time I've watched the movie??
LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOOOOOOOR
Finally watching frozen <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Super obvious drug deals.
And my skin hates me
You never realize how dry your skin is until you get out of the shower.
Forever looking at underwear and bras but not needing them
7 1/2 hour day is now done. Where's my bed?
Keep losing my time card so my manager set it up to my health card <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><INFORMATION DESK PERSON> #jeffisabeauty
Trying to ignore the fact the my stomach feels like it's tangled up right now
I get to go to murica this week. <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
3 people off my list for Christmas shopping, feels like a million more to go
Respect is a two way street.
Having some weird ass reaction to something KEWL
@frangibleheartt I hope you get accepted! You deserve some good and you'd look after that dog like a baby:(
@frangibleheartt it's the season for people to give animals as pets that can't look after them.. Makes me sad:( I want to love them:(
@frangibleheartt I love creeping you because WERE BOTH ON A DOG KICK.. I want this cutie so badly:( 
But I want to rescue one.
I've decided I want a dog ok
I have a tooth brush at David's now, does this make our relationship legit again??
Having manners pay off kids. Got a tim hortons gift card out of it.
No auto correct I meant to say manners not manors
Honestly in so much pain..
Adtr'a cover of since you've been gone is still my favourite
Pretty sure I pulled a muscle in my leg bowling yesterday lol
Grocery shopping? <HEAVY CHECK MARK>Ô∏è sleep deprived? <HEAVY CHECK MARK>Ô∏è
My far night consists of being at the bowling alley until 7 when I have wine in the fridge<WEARY FACE>
I protest that there should be a timmies at the end of my street <WEARY FACE>
Date nights get me excited ok #wineanddine
Wait did td actually do something good for me??
I get to cuddle all Tuesday night and all Wednesday. I'm one happy girl.
Everyone my age is getting engaged and having kids and i'm here working everyday and seeing David once a week.
When you finally realize how badly you need to go grocery shopping &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
I want wine but I'm too lazy to go to lcbo
I thank the lords for pizza when I haven't grocery shopped and am too lazy to make food anyway
But I do have a much needed day off tomorrow
Tuesday please hurry up
Stacys mom just came on at work <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Not being able to see someone who can make your day so much better when you're down is hard.
I only worked 6 hours today but my body hurts
But hey, thanks for giving me an anxiety attack than laugh when I left crying.
Drunk driving isn't a joke and talking about how you do it all the time while you're working is just wrong.
After tonight, I could really use a cold beer..
I hve hatred of my lips being dry so the fact I forgot my Chapstick is making me mad
I can't even type right today I'm so tired so fuck it
I should probably put pants on but u don't want to work today so not a priority
Bahumbug
@fine_great_ you're welcome! I have horrible vision so I know I few bits about it.
@fine_great_ call than again and say it's an extreme emergency, because it really is. That shouldn't be happening.
@fine_great_ that's not right.. They should try and get you in right away if it's that bad..
@fine_great_ I've never heard of that happening with glasses. Best bet is to go back and talk to them about it
Couldn't be happier
@fine_great_ do you wear contacts?
@fine_great_ honestly yes. If I don't wear my contacts/glasses for like an hour I start to feel sick.
But like cute slippers... not old lady ones
Someone buy me slippers for christmas. That's all I want.
So I started a new thing today 
2015 is about bettering myself.
I have a hole goal for myself for the new year and it's looking good.
Forever looking at wedding stuff
Excited to start this new venture and make some extra cash!
Paid for an old mans coffee today just for the Tim hortons employees to repay me with a free coffee. It's a good day for all:$
That moment when you realize you've lost so much that your favourite pants don't fit anymore <WEARY FACE>
I could listen to Marvin's Room all day
R.i.p to all the beautiful facial hair out there
Dear lord I'm happy
Whhhhhhhyy am I crying to Dallas Green right now?? I'm happy damnit

Lighting of the lights with my favourite co-worker and her little one <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Too scared to work fryers tonight so I get moved stations. My life

And thank god I downloaded adtr discography <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Two more shifts until a day off. I love my manager right now.
Whoops I love Dallas Green
Currently watching live streams of ferguson in utter shock..
If I leave my head in one position for long enough my ear stops hurting but that just doesn't work
Decisions decisions..
30.33 hours in one week?? I'll take it!!
@Aggnelleee I got my lease and it was spelt rebeca

I don't deserve to be treated like shit by guys.. But I always let it happen.
I fucking hate disrespectful people.
Jealous of people that know what time they're done work at.
My gaydar is broken
How did I make it to work early..
If I ever acted the way these kids did on the bus did, my parents would have murdered me.
I fucking hate disrespectful Highschool kids.
Should have left earlier for work because people forget how to drive when it snows #youliveincanada
If you have your license and need a job, I have an opportunity for you! Let me know!
Just because you don't have sex with someone doesn't mean it isn't cheating #justsaying
If you're standing at the bus stop for a significant amount of time, have your shit ready so you don't piss off everyone behind you
8 hours under my belt. Time for bed.
How disrespectful can you get..
All I want is a hot coffee and my chicken. Not to stand in the cold
So much for 2 days off this week #sickasadig #6daysok
Like some of us work and ya know.. Like to sleep before they work?
But when I do fall asleep, people call me and wake me up..
Whyyyy cant I sleeppp
So cold
Just going to avoid everyone because I'm tired of being played.
Shoutout to me for having the worst immune system ever
Shout out the @Popmaster155 for being a fucking BEAUT and buying me dinner.
@BrettCullen4_ I do oddly but you should send me pizza;)
I have no food because my bank sucks. Someone buy me pizza and I'll pay you back
Unless you want to give me your mcdons
No randoms on the bus. I don't want to talk. I just got off work and just want to go home to sleep.
Blink and mayday parade at work tonight. Okay boys <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Maybe.. Just maybe if you weren't creepy as fuck I would continue to talk to you
Wow you post videos and pictures of yourself smoking pot on the Internet.. So impressed <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Looking into buying a new phone that isn't an iphone... suggestions?
@frangibleheartt @VulcanTokes ummm this sounds perfect! I need to get out more anyway!
Like yes, I understand that women are viewed as weak and can't stand up to a man, but abuse happens both ways.
So there's a whole month in dedication of womans abuse... but are we forgetting about the men that are abused as well?
There's the people that get the freshman 15 and others that get the 4 year 60..
@frangibleheartt ... Creeping you and realized that was my life yesterday and I showed up an hour early
S/o to @BrettCullen4_ for answering all my phone needs.
reliving my elementary school days and listening to curtain call whoops
idk i just love  Jordan Dreyer's voice.
The fact that I downloaded the city and colour discography yesterday has made me happy and depressed at the same time
BUT THERE IS SNOW ON MY GODDAMN PATIO CHAIRS
Honestly, November is my favourite month because facial hair.....
Just yelled at my computer for 5 minutes because I couldn't find the shuffle button on itunes... Sowwy
already offered a promotion for after my 3 months #holla
wow I wish I could have a countdown to the weekend #myweekendismidweek
I fucking love coffee
Nts: take a picture of your schedule instead of convincing yourself you wrote it down late and being an hour early..
Throw back to when I was obsessed with Eminem
Someone lend me $20 so that I can get to work this week because td is fucked
I always think about shit people say at work like 4 days after the fact.
"How old are you, like 23?" #baby #shitihearatwork
What a shame the poor grooms bride is a whore.
hi give me albums to download babes
downloading 90's music because why the fuck not? #80gbipodproblems
omlette du fromage
All I do is drink water, work and sleep all day.. I need help.
Getting tired of being stood up okay
In west Philadelphia, born and raised.
The amount of water I drink now is abnormal
Someone drive me home from work tonight and I'll love you forever.
@Suptayluh if I wasn't so sure you were right dickered I would tell you to come bring me some
@Suptayluh kms
Someone that drives bring me mcdons
Going to work early just means going to bed even earlier
Trainer gave me the okay to yell at people. Okay!!
"Rebecca are you trying to grab my balls?" Yes. That's what I'm trying to do
And shake buckets leave blisters and cuts in your hands, and sore armpits
And 1 am showers are the best.
Getting blazing sauce, and salt and vinegar rub up your nose is a living hell
Having to wear gloves constantly is a pain in the ass, especially if you don't completely dry your hands
Boneless wing night... You need to bring some lube
You come home covered in more sauce than the wings themselves.
Things I've a learnt in my 4 shifts at my new job: a series of tweets
Yes my earache is from falling. No hearing loss is from my cold and no I don't need to see an ent doctor..
Now it's doctors time..
Nice clean room, pumpkin candle burning.. Now time to head to bed.
Ugh ultrasound
Movember is coming along nicely on ya boys
I'm not here to fuck around, I want a relationship.
Shoutout to the people that moved in above me yesterday for already annoying me
Sleeping 12 hours is honestly the best feeling everrrr
Just over 9 hours put in at work in 2 days. Feels good
I really needed lastnight
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho. It's off to work I go.
I wish my biggest problem was that someone wouldn't slow dance with me
I just miss my poppa more than anything in this world
Halloween is always rough for me..
No bra on? Let's hope the super doesn't come to look at things until I get one on..
Almost impossible to find a guy taller than me #tallerornothing
If you can match your bra and underwear everyday... You have your fucking life together
I mean.. Atleast your older brother is hot <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Screw Halloween..
So everyone forgot about als already damn
Maybe you being an ass was for the better #betterperson

You can take the sweet life and I'll take all the blame.
no strings attached.
Passing ends at 235 am and it's perfect @ManOverboardNJ
@Popmaster155 too bad I'm dying
The fact that Stella from himym was also in scrubs makes me happy
Everyone in this building probably hates my coughing fits
I just want to know what's wrong with me..
wait.. Brittney Spears was in how I met your mother....? @BrettCullen4_
Just pathetic
I think this is why I gave up on emotions
Finding out that someone has been leading you on for months is the hardest pill to swallow..
Cocaine and cocaine accessories.
But someone come cuddle.. And bring tea and soup while you're at it
Shout out to Vicks for allowing me to breathe long enough to get comfy
Having my last scheduled ceeps shift in 2 weeks.. Bitter sweet
@Sarah__14 .... Yup I'm dying..
Lemon tea and himym. Okay!
One week until movember <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
When I drink lemon tea it looks like I'm drinking pee..
Here's to hoping the water is back on by the time I get home
Too excited to start work.. Can't sleep
But on a positive note, I have my first shift at my new job tomorrow!
I'm honestly fucking sick of this
Why do I bother talking to anyone anymore.. All people do is ignore me constantly lol
Knowing that most bases in Canada are closed for precautions is scaring me because I live right near one..
You live in Ottawa and you're more concerned about getting your glasses than what's going on there right now? You're a fucking sick person..
Hi I'm in a shitty mood
And my bus driver forgot about the detour so now I'm laughing
I also just saw my first Asian with a hickey.
Was just told I look very fashionable after I felt like shit about myself today#pickup
Not knowing what time to leave at to get somewhere stresses me out because I hate being late
I haven't worn contacts since I fell so now hen I see people who are used to me with contacts they're like "wtf"
S/o o lalo who has to watch me pee.
Coming to realization that I am the most boring person ever.
@frangibleheartt like I stood beside Matt at a bus stop.. What.. But yes.. We have a problem

@frangibleheartt and why the hell have we not hung out before.. #forreal
@frangibleheartt the fucking survey.. And for sure! (If I don't work that is!)
@frangibleheartt I need money for that stuff:( but I do need some hugs:(
Fuck the people that get into a relationship and stop talking to their "bestfriend" okay.
Well this shit is annoying
@Suptayluh I used to work until 2am most days.. Pushing it back an hour #holla but ya weird as fuckk
@Suptayluh thank god no. I just realized who she was was.. And I went in at 11 for orientation
Getting trained by someone I used to be bestfriends with in grade 9, okayyyy
If I start talking to you, and you say "u" instead of "you"... your chances are over
So I start work Thursday looool <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
What is with me picking places to work in buttfuck nowhere
Told myself to leave the house by 9.. Left the house at 850. Impressed with myself
Why am I so nervous for orientation..
When I say I don't have your number saved, don't just give me a first name.. That's not helpful
Oh where are all my lighters
@MattG124 three of my favourite youtubers in one video! It's perfect!
I guess this means I should put a bra on
Seeing @MattG124 in the ctfxc and shaytards video made me cry a bit okay
Orientation tomorrow <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è

Forever watching drunk girls try to walk in heels

What this means, you'll never know. Up all night, all alone.
and I'm sure your mom looks after all the kids.. but like.. there are people in this world willing to love a child who can't get pregnant..
Like how do you even have time for sex with a 3 month old..
Sorry, you're younger than me and got knocked up 3 months after having your first kid..... damn

Blaring blink at work? No complaints <HEAVY CHECK MARK>Ô∏è
Long story short, the world can't fucking stop because it's your kids birthday.
You're mad that not everyone called your kid on her birthday. Funny because before facebook, you never wished me a happy birthday???
My bed still smells like you <WEARY FACE>
So I'm just not going to buy underwear for a year....
Today, I realized I have more underwear than t-shirts.
As much as i love my short hair, i kinda miss it long whoops

"He wants the diddly" - @GrimmJonny

Don't assume a girl is talking to other guys when you hide your phone everytime you use it.... #doublestandards

BUT NOW I'M ON ANOTHER VIDEO WHERE A GIRL HAS HER EYEBROW PIERCED BUT SHAVED THEM OFF AND DREW HER EYEBROWS ON SUPER HIGH WHYYY
sorry thats my rant.
to your smaller size and let them heal more.. LISTEN TO YOUR EARS. Listen to the idiot that tore the inside of their ear going to 1/2".
Like if your ears are burning/hurting to the point you need to jump around and look like an idiot before you get the largest part go back --
Watching a video of girls stretching their ears for the first time (like 14g through 2g) and I want to hit them.
This is your last chance..
This calls for an early night.. Fuck you
I'm sure with all the pictures you post of you at a bar make people really want to listen to you when you bitch about having no money.
Honestly, I'm tired of wasting my time on people that clearly don't give one fuck about me #byebye
Cooking a crock pot with glasses on is the true struggle #mylife
my love for @sorryimalex is real
Try to nap, lawn mowing.. try again when they're done.. outside my bedroom window talking.. WHYYYYYY
So my physio guy was an old man.. That was weird

You're older than my mom. I don't want to see your g string hanging out.
This woman laughs like woody the wood pecker. Whyyyyyyyyyyu
I get overly frustrated with people who take the bus and bitch about waiting a few minutes. Like you missed the bus, it's not late..
But s/o to the guy that helped me today that said my eyes were still wonky:(
Cramps from hell.. And they sent me to physio? Not okay
Work last night was probably a bad idea...

Voicemail doesn't work all day, finally get it to work and it was wsib calling me. COOOOL....
They always tell you not to go grocery shopping when you're hungry.... I experienced that today. Anyone want doughnuts?
Cons of a concussion: I can either be hungry enough to eat everything or be too naseous to eat anything
Starting to get really frustrated with this confusion..
I always hated people who used emerge for colds and the flu.. But fuck I just experienced that for the first time today..
Stuck in emerge. Help

I honestly watch some of most random shit on YouTube.
Didn't know parents could really feel like that towards their kid. But whatever. Guess it's all out.
I legit HATE when people know I work late, and fucking text or call me early in the morning. Like thanks. Not like I only slept 4 hours...
My roommate informed me that my neighbours are lesbian and have like 10 cats. They're my new favourites.
Storm, rain, popcorn, and dr phil. Hello

Welcome to North America where one innocent person is shot and killed, we riot. (1)
Innocent children (and adults) are being shot and killed everyday over seas. Why don't we riot about that?

The main thing that bugs me about the teen choice awards is that it's based more on the persons looks than their talent
Holy fuck this wind is cold.
If I'm not wearing black jeans, black shorts or a kitchen uniform. Chances are, i'll be wearing yoga leggings....... or not pants at all.
Kinda sad that even the health unit has to sexualize women to get a point across. I mean really, tits out? 
Crossing the street legally only to be stopped in the middle of an intersection because an ambulance is coming. Okay
I hardly have a voice and I have a presentation today. Alright.
My head feels like it's going to explode b/c stress.
Rainy days call for an early night at work
But really. Depression is never a joke, and you're never alone. Reach out.
Depression doesn't choose who it hits. #riprobinwilliams
Night off calls for my favourite dinner, kitchen nightmares and homework. OKAY
