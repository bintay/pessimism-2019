@KingzKnows That really does suck. You know what I'd love right now? Pedro Favre's opinion. #disrespect
@KingzKnows Not good for him or Jags but what can you do?
@KingzKnows He WILL re-emerge &amp; WILL follow you as the ultimate sign of respect #BookIt
@KingzKnows Is this the worst news of all time?
@KTaylor026 @aoutrakis @richsciacca Of course, KT gets La'el!
@MoveTheSticks What's your favorite(s)?
@Franko097 I might have spent 5th, 6th or 7th and hoped he would just sign.
@Franko097 Still can't believe nobody drafted him. U mean u couldn't say "We believe in innocent til guilty &amp; can cut ties if worsens"?!?
@pigbete1 Inconceivable
Penalize Pats &amp; all but love narrative ignores this RT @footballfacts: "Both teams played w/ balls below legal limit" 
@ktaylor026 I see that as Mac/Desean combined for 64mil &amp; Matthews/Agholor combine for like 4. And Shady complaining. But know what u mean
@ktaylor026 KT u believe this? He also swapped white QBs, signed DeMarco, Mathews, Maxwell &amp; drafted Agholor.
@DaveReidNJ Ha. Holland off DL. Had to make a move. @Alfs11thFinger
@BradWright25 @Alfs11thFinger Harper single handedly taking care of business.
@leefitting @CollegeGameDay If only u could get rid of Desmond Howard
@Frankussc Stepping up, manning up or nutting up? Big difference on Frankus scale of upping
@Franko097 Wow. That's big. I'm TO!
@KingzKnows Good luck on your finalz
@awfulannouncing That's great. Rovell is the worst
@coachthorpe There a reason u WOULDNT do Offense choose Ball Out or 2FT every time in bonus?
@jimwexell Who were the other 3?
@Franko097 Hahaha wow
@Alfs11thFinger Huge Goose Balls - Underhill matchup today
@EthanJSkolnick Oh man that stinks.
@richarddeitsch Harlan is the man, though
@richarddeitsch Ah man agree to disagree on this one. Dislike webber. Him touting Deandre for his D after an offensive rebound an example
@KDPomp That foul call on Duncan against Paul was so bad.
What a game. Still hate to see that foul on Paul but man that was just nonstop huge action. Winner of that series could go long way
@KingzKnows Dang. I liked those late corners.
@KingzKnows Wow. BookCity. Is that new?  I don't love draft grades but I really like what Steelers did. A/B. How bout you &amp; ur Eagles?
@haralabob No
Wow you can't call that. Not a foul. Man that's bad.
@KDPomp Amen Pomp
This has to be the greatest 3-6 matchup &amp; 1st Rd Game 7 of all time
Chris Webber just touted Deandre as such a strong Defensive player because of the offensive rebound he got &amp; stood with it?!? @haralabob
The depth was needed but love idea of guys like Coates &amp; James being ready to step up in Yr 2/3 instead of immediately needing rookies then
We'll see how many make team but it felt like no "wasted" picks this yr on token QB or RB or P. Chickillo only luxury &amp; still kinda needed
James, a true Jr, almost like get him now &amp; he's a rookie during his Sr yr. maybe woulda been drafted higher next yr, redshirt &amp; learn
Steelers took my top choice in 1st, 4th &amp; 5th rds.
No OL...and now already 4 C/G signed as UDFAs to compete. DE depth prob needed more than even realized so Walton nice addition there
Overall really happy/optimistic w/ Steelers draft. 6 D, 2 O sounds about right. 2 pass rushers, 3 DBs &amp; 2 Ben weapons also does.
The draft ends just as the Derby is about to begin. #uge
Golson 10 picks. Holliman 14. Steelers identifying they gotta create turnovers?!? Holliman will have to stick but in 7th...love it.
@richarddeitsch NFL Network is dominating ESPN today. Just flipped to ESPN during a commercial &amp; experienced an awful &amp; awkward discussion
#Uge RT @KWill_24: It's a blessing to announce that I have committed to play my college basketball at The University of North Carolina
Wow. Chickillo is nice. More OLB depth. I like it.
Sounds like Walton could even play some DE, which they might be thinner there. Solid.
Wow ok a big DT. Good to add to mix. Some McCullers competition, practice squad potential. Not big on McLendon either. Good position to take
@KingzKnows Derron was great pick
Lael, Ifo, KWhite, Holliman, Roberts, Tye, Callahan, McDonald, Mbu, Lott, Marshall, Saxton, Clear, Sifrin, Matias, 2 Robinsons, Spain, Drum
@KingzKnows Now another DB. Man, thought u booked Ifo?
@KingzKnows Wow. U were wrong. But JaCorey is bigtime. Maybe Ifo next.
@richeisen @MoveTheSticks @CFD22 Mayock is the man. He doesn't need twitter. Don't need to discuss. Gotta discuss the picks!
Raiders Max Valles. Opposite of Khalil. That's big.
@KingzKnows Ifo makes big plays. Would be great pick. About 12 away. U getting pumped?
@KingzKnows Think he'll be theirz?
@KingzKnows Are the Eagles still in the NFL?
Steelers pounding needs. Love drafting guys from 2012 recruiting class like James. 3 Defense, 2 Ben Toys. Real big so far.
Wow. It is. RT @Thav916: Plus all sorts of TEs. JJames, Saxton, Clear, Uzomah, Sifrin, Backman. Bunch more. Could it be Jesse James time?
G/T always a possibility. Really like Max Valles if they'd actually take another OLB
Plus all sorts of TEs. JJames, Saxton, Clear, Uzomah, Sifrin, Backman. Bunch more. Could it be Jesse James time?
La'el, Ifo, JaCorey, KWhite, Derron, Holliman, Gaines, Roberts, Callahan, McDonald, Mbu, Lott, Marshall
@SACfootball Wow my boy Stefon Diggs to Vikings in the 5th. Really coulda been a valuable Milky Bag this year
@KingzKnows Chip's the man
@KingzKnows Dang King. Still could be big.
Getting another CB like Grant now makes the Coates pick even better
Holy cow, Doran Grant, my top guy. What a pick. Doubling up on CB. This is big.
Saxton, Clear, Uzomah, Backman, Roberts, Callahan, McDonald, Hardison, Mbu, Lott, Ajayi, Marshall.  Man, what a day.
Top Guys: La'el, Grady Jarrett, Ifo, JaCorey, Kevin White, Derron Smith, Holliman, Doran Grant, Jesse James, MyCole, Gaines, Shaw.
This Day 3 NFL Network crew is as good as it gets. Should be Day 1. @richeisen @MoveTheSticks @CFD22 #Mayock @richarddeitsch.
5 picks today. CB, TE, S, NT......G/T, RB. Is my order of preference. QB &amp; ILB probably last.
@richarddeitsch I thought Charlie Strong was pretty bad. You getting a lot of that or what's general reaction? Eisen, Mayock, Davis SO GOOD
@KingzKnows U ready for today?
Wow. Sam Coates. Love adding weapons. Dude has to just be 3rd or 4th WR. Bigtime talent. So raw. Don't mind taking the shot.
CBs flyin off but Steven Nelson &amp; Doran Grant still there among others. This pick will be interesting. Could go so many different directions
@KingzKnows Ur boy PJ off the board
Tyler Lockett seems ideal for Seattle.  Same with Owa to Giants
Raiders adding Amari &amp; now Clive. Real nice for Carr.
Gotta look into double dipping at CB in 3rd. With 2 biggest needs taken also more open to TE, WR, NT, S, G/T, RB.
@ktaylor026 Gregory!
Still love Bud but Owa, Harold &amp; Gregory all still available wow.
Golson really pure CB. So needed. Nose for ball. Looks tough. Needed a CB &amp; got one.
@KingzKnows Needed a CB so much more. Might be blessing in disguise.
My boy Spielman!!!!!   (Ickey was amazing)
So Roethlisberger has played for the Steelers longer than Jim Kelly for the Bills? Wow. Seems like he was there forever.
My Top Guys: Quinten. PJ. Senquez. Carter. Doran. Nelson. Maxx. Clive.  Phillips. Davis. Jaelen. cooper. Gregory. orchard. Harold. Fisher.
@KingzKnows Can play both
@KingzKnows Wow. Rowe. That's who I wanted. Kinged.
@KingzKnows ur Huskies are flying off the board.
@KingzKnows Wow why u like so much?
Kelvin &amp; Funch. Holy size. @Frankussc
@KingzKnows U booking?  Who u want for Eagles?
Love DGB Titans. Gotta give young QB weapons. Always remember when colts took luck then 2 TEs etc &amp; "bashed" for not taking D! All bout QB
Others: big NT like Phillips or Davis. TE Maxx or Clive. WR like Jaelen. G/T or S.
Eric Rowe my favorite CB. So many CBS out there. Rollins. Jalen. Darby. PJ. Carter. Doran. Golson. Nelson.
@KingzKnows Kinged!
There it is. Jets go Lenny/Devin vs Raiders Amari/Edwards.  Devin is bigtime weapon for Geno.
Amari &amp; Edwards is nice but gotta wonder how it'll compare to Lenny Williams &amp; Strong/DGB
This is great that Steelers stood pat but get to see what the price of the trade really was
@richarddeitsch Not big on college coaches until the 3rd day but Charles Davis replacing Mooch is a monumental upgrade.
Here we go. What a big night.
I hate saying "gotta" but steelers almost gotta go CB w/ one of these two tonight.
Eric Rowe &amp; a handful of CBs out there. Couple big NTs like Jordan Phillips. All TEs. Lots of WR talent.
@CLawSoHard @Jefflaw4187 @char_mck Maybe the greatest question of all time. Still thinking.
@CLawSoHard @jefflaw4187 Hahahahhahahahaha
Group text ? from @Jefflaw4187 - "Would u rather see a picture of steeler big board or picture of @char_mck's huge cans?" @CLawSoHard #Draft
@BradWright25 I still mighta taken that if I'm Titans but it wouldn't have been bad for Eagles
@BradWright25 Ya I saw that one (and woulda taken) but then saw swap 1sts, another 1st, a QB &amp; another pick/player &amp; changes things
@richarddeitsch I was fully ready for NFL Net to dominate ESPN last night w/ Lewis being distant 8th outta main 8. Riddick swung balance big
@BradWright25 What was offer you saw?
5 of Front 7 &lt; 26 yrs old. Plus Shamarko. Let's add another 1 or 2 tonight.
Turrible RT @arielhelwani: Alexander Gustafsson is injured and out of his 6/20 fight against Teixeira.
@richarddeitsch NFL Network should just go with Eisen, Davis, Jeremiah, Mayock. No fluff. All draft. Would be unstoppable.
@richarddeitsch I'm ok w/ Shaw but I think coaches each doing 60-90 minutes &amp; being revolving door on Saturday is where coaches should be
Only 5 DBs in 1st Rd. Hopefully good for Steelers tomorrow.
@richarddeitsch Mooch should not be on "A" team. Tough call for me tonight. Big Eisen &amp; Mayock fan. But Riddick over Ray was HUGE. And Mel
Can't wait to see what OLBs will be available at 55 to compare. But can't base it off hindsight. Just interesting.
@clutchrocks72 Ha. I got faith.
#Uge RT @BruceFeldmanCFB: Bud Dupree may be the Freakiest athlete in this draft.
YES! BUD!!! Man that's huge. Was my top choice on board. Wow. #uge
Gotta wonder if they have a favorite dback
A trade down would be so big. Dupree. Ray. Gregory. Owa. Harold. Landon. Rowe. Jalen. Byron. Randall. Some others all out there.
@KingzKnows Are you ready?
Peters gone. Top 4 w/ some flags. Take 1 or look elsewhere? Rowe/Byron/Jalen/other CB? Owa/Harold/other OLB? DL? OL? WR? Maxx? Trade?
@UNCRecruits I follow you for great UNC recruiting info. Why are you ruining my NFL draft?
Wow. There goes Johnson. Gregory, Ray, Dupree, Landon, Peters still available. Shaping up nicely of upside guys. But falling for reasons?
@Alfs11thFinger I've already heard of 3 texts claiming the trade was a rip off.  Funny thing...2 claimed one way. 1 claimed other way!
Gregory, Ray &amp; Dupree all still out there w/ 10 picks to go. Only 3 combined OLB/CB. Could be big.
I'm scared to play Danny Shelton twice a year but also kinda pumped to watch him twice a year
@Jason_J_W Incredible swap. Was almost too good to be true when I read earlier. 
Same with Raiders &amp; Carr here
Fowler is the man &amp; so many rounds left but man Bortles needs so much help on offense &amp; bigtime WRs there
If I'm Titans I take that Eagles offer
Mike Evans is so sweet. Winston lucky.  I like Bucs situation so much more than Titans.
This is so big
@aoutrakis RT @EvanDaniels: Kenny Williams, a four-star guard, told Scout he is down to North Carolina &amp; Virginia.
@PedroFavre Say it ain't so! 
@jefflaw4187 Man I have to
OLBs like Owa, Harold, Orchard &amp; Preston Smith. Plus a Gregory or Ray falling. Gonna be tempting &amp; would be nice getting Bigtime OLB
Could even be a great year to go CB CB in top two rounds.
Johnson, Peters, Byron Jones, Rollins, JCollins, Rowe. Could see Steelers liking any of those guys. Tough to rank.
@KingzKnows I was just gonna ask you about Johnson since I know you study a ton of Wake Forest tape
@richarddeitsch These are great. Charles Davis should be higher. U perfectly described Dilfer. No Ray Lewis is amazing news.
My guess tonight is Kevin Johnson, CB. Just seems like the solid player to take &amp; plug in. Need + Value really gives options at CB &amp; OLB
@KingzKnows U ready for Billy D?
@jefflaw4187 Wow. Wish I knew sooner.
@BurghBites @jefflaw4187 Did u try these??
Draft day. #Uge
@primantibros Why isn't there a Primantis at the Pittsburgh airport?!?
@jefflaw4187 Your Pedro bashing lives on!!!
@MollyMcGrathFS1 Stephen A is terrible
Wow RT @arielhelwani: Jon Jones stripped of title, Daniel Cormier vs. Anthony Johnson is set for UFC 187, per @foxsportslive.
Rockets crushing Mavs after the Parsons signing is so great. Ariza so affordable. Daryl Morey took a lot of heat but so good.
Really thought Cheick Diallo wouldn't be able to say no to Mullin. What a get by Self. Cal, K, Self, maybe Miller just doing what they want
@SpearsNBAYahoo They might go undrafted next year, too. Lots of places to play professionally, work on game &amp; not take classes
@Franko097 Mock drafts kinda stupid but yet so needed by average, casual or dedicated fan by now that if ur w draft guy u gotta
@Franko097 Ya that's kinda my point. It's like NCAA Tournament. General public likes it more &amp; half convinced its bc they can have a bracket
@InsideCarolina @UNCRecruits Need a gigantic 2016 class
@CLawSoHard Feel the same
@Franko097 If a guy came out w/ rankings for all 32 teams or multiple schemes or just went by tiers &amp; explained why I think more beneficial
@Franko097 They have some value. People just care so much. And draft guys worry bout being wrong.
@jgrace21 Exit row AND nobody in middle seat. #uge
It's like everybody knows how stupid mock drafts are these days but yet people still want them so draft people still make them, though
Draft week is so huge
@awfulannouncing Casserly is the man. Hellie stinks.
@KingzKnows The next DeSean?
@KingzKnows Holy cow you booking Phil Dorsett?
@Alfs11thFinger I drafted Matt Joyce before Danny Salazar
@McCulloughStar Thinkin he'll be fine?
@richarddeitsch Oh God no. @FOXSports1. Don't do it.
How can you point to Scott Brooks' "record" after GS just canned MJax last year for Kerr &amp; look so much better?
@EthanJSkolnick He stinks. Was overdue.
@KingzKnows Brooks!!!!!  Man I booked that. That's huge.
@KingzKnows Wow. That's big.
@KingzKnows U booking that?
@KDPomp Hahahahahahaha that's why you're the man. #PompinAintEasy
@KDPomp Kangin Ain't Easy
@awfulannouncing He tweeted at her &amp; it wasn't even that bad. Not worth a story.
@JackieCainTV Tough to type w/ pizza in one hand! I'm not familiar, I gotta check it out
@JackieCainTV Ha, where's that? I've never had.
@JackieWTAE @WTAE Jackie, you gotta get @pgh_slice while you're in Beechview
@Franko097 Ya just wanted to level set. Funny thing is Bucs fans want to GO FOR IT like Pens &amp; now look at it
@Franko097 Jonny, real quick note here but current GM Rutherford been in job since June. Previous GM was Shero.
@UNCRecruits 2
@Alfs11thFinger Really messed up not keeping Kemp.
@HoopsRumors @CW_Crouse For turning down Kevin Love trade...YES
@CLawSoHard @jefflaw4187 @steelers May this be his hardest year yet
@Alfs11thFinger What an epic #SliceBowl - At least 2 more this season. Now gotta pick toppings! @LTunnellVision
@AdamSchefter Tebow was better &amp; probably is still better
@richarddeitsch Hope you want her fired
@Frankussc @Isaiah_Thomas He doesn't
Rockets taking it to Parsons would be so big
The next couple off seasons are gonna be so big for Pelicans. Need more but can't force. Davis is ready.
@haralabob Thoughts on any team offense is in bonus they get option of 2FT or ball out of bounds?
Think I'd be fine w/ Offense getting choice of 2FT or ball out every time.
I'm big on "Spirit of the Rule". Going to bonus was to penalize D for too many fouls. Now used as a reward &amp; take advantage of.
Gotta change the FT rule somehow I. NBA. It's just not good.
@KingzKnows You were huge today. Passed out bigtime hot dogz. Heard you hooked up a few babes w/ a special King-sized dog
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard On my way. Closer to 7:20-7:30. Where are you?
@donvito72 @PedroFavre Fuck you. No fuck you. No, FUCK you. Go fuck yourself. Fuck yooooou. (Beef &amp; Bull reference). Ok, let's hug.
@hoopshype They gotta fire him
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Where you gonna be? We'll wake you up
@KingzKnows King, I need Kinged tomorrow
@KingzKnows U pissed about Heron?
@WhitneyDrolen @espn @BrittMcHenry Wow. Yes! Thank you. She should be fired. You're a role model inside &amp; out. She's a disgrace.
@WhitneyDrolen She should be fired
@ESPN @richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing Ridiculous if paid. Shoulda been fired. #Disgrace #Bully @BillSimmons @DickieV @MarkMaddenX
@PghBizTimes @PBT_Tim "Large deli". Will that be a big spot for lunch options like u might see in a Whole Foods or Market District?
@KingzKnows Gotta fire Brooks
@Franko097 RT @Steelersdepot: Report: Several #Jets Staffers Wanted To Draft #Steelers WR Martavis Bryant Last Year 
...how bout enjoys college life, being a kid, being BMOC, being around friends &amp; wants to grow more? Both sides just really anger me
And flip side is when a Top 5er decides to come back to college but "passed up millions" "shoulda left" "could fall in draft next year"...
...how bout he wants to earn $ professionally (non NBA), can work on game 24/7, doesnt have to study/take tests &amp; likely wouldnt help stock
A Jr that is projected to go 50th-undrafted enters draft. "Terrible decision" "Got bad info" "Shoulda stayed"....
College athletes leaving "too" early OR staying in school w/ hi stock always really bothers me when people act like they made wrong decision
@Alfs11thFinger Always huge to check scores &amp; see some of your players not only played but had big games. And sucks when they stank!
@GoodmanESPN What if they just want to earn money, work on their games 24/7 &amp; not go to class? Plus, likely wouldn't improve stock
@chadfordinsider @NateSilver538 Why limit it to Non playoff teams? I say worst 20 teams all get a shot
@KDPomp Pompin ain't easy at Redbeards! "You da man" "No, you da man!"
@LTunnellVision @Alfs11thFinger @Bmorejal328 WOW
@JColony13 You're dominating this Pitt Wake game as PA Announcer/DJ. @jason_j_w gotta be jealous
@KDKAHeather @Pgh_Slice Wow. Slice. So good. Making me want it. Need it. Gotta have it.
@BillFlow21 This might be better off Twitter but is making a couple hundred thou &amp; not taking college classes THAT bad?
@daldridgetnt You didn't say that. You said any. Wow you suck.
@UNCRecruits @clintjackson1 Chances that UNC goes wild on 2016 recruits &amp; Roy seals the deal w/ a Top 3 Star Studded 4-5 man class?
@Alfs11thFinger My boy Miguel "Don't Call Me Gonzalez" Castro w/ a huge save.
Bigtime picture credit. Ha, thanks @Jackie_Schafer

@KingzKnows @PedroFavre #Bookit
@CLawSoHard It's definitely hard to put into tweets
I think it's wise of NBA to require 2/3 yrs of non HS ball for fuller evaluation, ala Football, &amp; other jobs having pre-requisites
..Is that A)Shoulda been able to go pro last yr to make millions or B)Smart to have watched play &amp; evaluate further?
Cliff Alexander. Last yr, mighta gone Top 5. Then played college ball. Now might go 2nd Rd....
@andrewperloff Wolfson didn't even ask about it. No follow-ups to anything Bo said.
@BryanDFischer Haha exactly. Did Gumbel even listen? And Wolfson didn't even ask to elaborate. @richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing
@MarchMadnessTV @awfulannouncing @richarddeitsch Why didn't Wolfson have ANY follow-up questions for what Bo said? That was bad.
@chadfordinsider He should be a top 10 pick. Move him up your mock.
Grant Hill should never go into the commercial when announcing w/ Raft
Is Rafi on the Pirates this year? He actually mighta had better chance against Aroldis
@alfs11thfinger Chuck T sniped Kendrick from my on waivers but then didn't even start him! #ChuckTd
@alfs11thfinger #ALFisUGE Holy Alf.
@alfs11thfinger @Franko097 DTravis. You SOB.
@KingzKnows Wow. You're a volunteering beast. Thought u were gonna challenge me to a race.
@KingzKnows Holy cow. Am I gonna get Kinged? Does 5K really stand for the earrings you'll be wearing??
@Alfs11thFinger Wow. Just realized Melvin Upton Jr is BJ Upton. Wow.
@BillFlow21 That was real bad
It's pretty obvious Kentucky just wasn't the same after facing PRESS VIRGINIA. Those body shots were just way too much!
@BillFlow21 AT LEAST!!!
@KingzKnows That's BIG. And you're the best looking urinal cleaner I know, King. I bet you serve the best chos, too.
@KingzKnows it's not official until I see the hashtag #Bookit
@KingzKnows Book that, King.
The non flagrant, the weak flop, the non shot clock were all over the place but man, how dont u feed Towns nonstop &amp; they just didn't
A 9:18 tip stinks
Can't believe Duke isn't gonna have to play Kentucky
@KingzKnows Holy cow. You vs Uncle Billy?  Loser streaks through the neighborhood?
@KingzKnows U bookin Kentucky?
From Nov 18th...not bad RT @Thav916: So is this the game Izzo loses by 80 &amp; then plays Duke again in Final Four to a 7 OT thriller??
@KDPomp @937theFan Totally agree Pomp. I like that call.
@DaveReidNJ That's big. I kinda hope they keep him down there for awhile.
@JonHeymanCBS When do u guess he'll be up?  As SP or RP?
@KingzKnows Need some big tweets outta you
@KingzKnows King, where U been?
Izzo bein Izzo
@richarddeitsch @MarchMadnessTV @awfulannouncing Great move to pair Verne &amp; Spanarkel this yr w/ Raft on "A" team
@Frankussc U miss Milk Dud?
@richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing Man I don't think Grant Hill adds ANYTHING. And it's weird he calls Raft "Coach". No one else ever did.
Lee Tunnell, Fantasy MVP RT @LTunnellVision: @Alfs11thFinger Did somebody say something about LTV's 2015 keepers? 

@KingzKnows That's bigtime, King. Congrats.
@KingzKnows Olympic dude &amp; Mariner really does sound Bigtime, King. It officially booked?
@DLayton32 @jefflaw4187 @KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Should take em to Gloria's then YOU do the dancing, King. #Gloriaz
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows @jefflaw4187 Al Davis?
@Frankussc @YinkasPostMoves That's gonna be big. @jjmmss99 still might get 1st pick...
@Frankussc Do u have opinions or just facts?
@Frankussc Zero problem w/ him being your vote. Amazing season. Just disagree w/ 'HAS to'
@Frankussc Too many good candidates to say anybody HAS to in my opinion
Huge win. What a fun team. Fun identity. So tough &amp; tenacious. Low expectations. Just battle. Press Virginia. Sweet 16. #uge
@GoodmanESPN Wow. Joey Mazz. That's big.
Didn't see this coming but I think I'm good with, or even like, Gottlieb as an announcer. And Ian Eagle is always solid
@awfulannouncing Huggs is the greatest
@KingzKnows No way I'd ever believe it...unless u book it. U bookin braking the bank?!?!
@KingzKnows U got a better chance of landing on the moon than Cal does coming back home to Pitt
@KingzKnows I thought Calipari was from the Moon in outer space
@KingzKnows Wow. Yes. Kinda fucked up their so cheep they won't brake the bank.
@KingzKnows Who would U rather have as Pitt's Bball coach? Dixon. Archie Miller. Dan Mullen.

@GoodmanESPN @GottliebShow I agree. Okafor doesn't have elite size or athleticism matched up against NBA 5s
Might be in minority but I've got Karl Anthony Towns &amp; Dangelo Russell over Jahlil Okafor for the draft
@KingzKnows Sanchise can do it all on his own.
@KingzKnows I get overall point but Kiko is not nothing. DeSean a thug. Cap Room also big but need to do good things w/ it.
@KingzKnows Lots of time to add a back
@KingzKnows LaMichael James could be the RB
@KingzKnows U wanted a Bigtime Defense. Chip doesn't need Shady. He just needs you.
@KingzKnows Ki(ng)ko
@KingzKnows Dang King. U go to our spot Lagerheadz?
@KingzKnows How u been able to view your favorite anime bondage videos?
@Jason_J_W @CSBDI1Hoops U probably could have learned what time all the games were today.
@awfulannouncing Good move
@SARAS_BHS Mr. Saras! 2009 BHS graduate. You were my favorite. Would be honored to have a follow back!!!
@beekface Great tweet
@richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing Path to the Draft is so good but Curtis Conway &amp; Andrew Siciliano are soooo bad. #PTTD
@jimwexell Love it. Just wanted to clarify no pipe dream in 2nd or hypothetical trade up. Like Harold, too, at 22?
@jimwexell Owa 22nd?
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Holy cow. Your picture. I'm honestly not familiar w/ post college biz card so Id wait for Claw's response.
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard I NEED your Buzinezz Kard so bad, King
@JennBrown Cain
@Gil_Brandt U think Owa could play OLB in a system like Steelers?
@Alfs11thFinger Kershaw. Giancarlo. Starlin. Holland. Manny. Gattis. Samardzija. Can only keep 4. #OnALFsBlock
@richeisen U guys get carried away w/ "Best DL" times but meanwhile a bunch are LBs. Should do Top DE/LBs when all done
Seven bigtime pass rushers...Fowler, Beas, Ray, Gregory, Harold, Owa &amp; Dupree. Any there at 22 could be huge.
@JoshNorris @smartfootball Wow awesome graphic
@thisfinebrazil Because it'd be nice
@CFD22 My old VP said you were his boss at Disney! That's so great.
Kevin White. That was big.
@richeisen Why can't you get official numbers immediately?
@PSchrags Only people like White &amp; Pat Russ rise above at WVU
@awfulannouncing @richarddeitsch Vitale, whom I like &amp; respect, was NOT missing. Shulman &amp; Bilas were great.
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows 1st order of business: Washington Wild Thingz. Second: #KingzThingz Night
@KingzKnows Richmond?
@KingzKnows How long intill that?
I like Heat, too. Turrible PG situation, PRiley does not rebuild, can offer Dragic a ton. Dragic, Wade, Deng, Bosh, Hassan sounds nice
@KingzKnows Ha. KPerk was like 5 black guys in 1. Guess they do have a bunch now but got both.
Sixers getting two firsts &amp; Javale for MCW is big, too. Need that Lakers pick to be 6-8 this yr. Risky. But might not wanna pay MCW
DMorey being @dmorey gettin KJ McDaniels &amp; Priglioni
Lillard, Wes Math, Afflalo, Batum &amp; Lamarc could be a really fun lineup
Thunder getting Enes, DJ, Novak &amp; Singler &amp; getting rid of RJax &amp; Perk might be next. If only they had a Waiters mulligan.
Jazz getting a 1st, 2nd AND officially starting the Gobert Era today mighta been my favorite move of the day
@craibs87 NHL Trade Deadline or your self-imposed "Must bench 500lbs" deadline? Probably both. And I'll be ready.
Holy fuck what a deadline
@Franko097 Wow. PRiley.
@KingzKnows @Franko097 @ESPNSteinLine KINGED!  Enes!
@Franko097 !!!!!! RT @ESPNSteinLine: Goran Dragic has been traded to Miami, I'm told
I'm ready for Shaka (or somebody) MT @GoodmanESPN: UNC missing expectations lately -- and not changing anytime soon 
@BradWright25 Ha. Protein in the nutra. Or maybe that's just me.
@Mike_Perhosky U can hate my sports allegiances but don't doubt my Pizza taste! 
@BradWright25 I thought he was gonna weigh in at like 204 or something
@Mike_Perhosky No doubting Fiori's but if you're ever in Forest Hills you HAVE to get a Vinnie Pie (Vincents Pizza Park)
NBA Trade Deadline. #Uge
@KingzKnows Blopez to Thunder would be nice in my opinion
That's why Bilas is the man. Analyzes &amp; critiques the Block/Charge instead of just going nuts about a great Charge
@KingzKnows #Kinged #KingMe #HolyCowYoureKingzKnowsAgain #Uge
Straight Eye Test Joel James wins Naismith
@KingzKnows What about Makay?
@KingzKnows No I'm not forgetting that. That's actually one of my MAIN thoughts in forming my opinion
@KingzKnows I don't think he's got the speed to guard a lot of PFs like yourself.
Jaglil Okafor is really good but I'm just not huge on him as clear top pick. Seems like undersized Center w/o great athleticism.
@Frankussc @BillSimmons Should text me before you get pissed at me for too many tweets
@Frankussc @BillSimmons Celts is prob my least favorite. Any other...Houston, Miami, LAL he'd be nice piece of puzzle. But ? on other stuff
@Frankussc @YinkasPostMoves @BillSimmons I agree to not super overpay &amp; not perfect everywhere but no team getting him as main guy
@jordancarver Was fun following your gigantic breasts while it lasted.
Wow. Storming court w/ Country Roads playing. Brent on the call. #Uge
@KingzKnows Perkins + what?
I did like having a 1 credit basketball class in there, though.
Really wish WVU blew up Coliseum &amp; built new, sweet 12,000 everybody sits on top of the court arena.
@Jason_J_W @CLawSoHard Tony Bennett. So sweet.
@Frankussc LD!
@jmdell639 @Frankussc @NBAonTNT You thought correctly. It IS a joke.
Is this Fashion Show a joke?!?@NBAonTNT @Frankussc
@Frankussc Wow. That's big. Fantastic.
@KingzJameis You &gt; Me
Annoying part of Draft analysts. Kiper puts Breshad Perriman in his 1st Rd &amp; suddenly &amp; coincidentally others now talk about him
@richarddeitsch I would've liked Barkley to specifically address calling Rockets bad on D when stats show otherwise. @DMorey
@richarddeitsch Big Barkley fan but I'm 100% on #TeamMorey for this. Barkley sounds like an idiot. @DMorey.
Wow. Fantasy Baseball. #Uge RT @Alfs11thFinger: 18 Teams. $150. 6 keepers. Minor League spots. Might be open spot. Are YOU interested?
@awfulannouncing @NBAonTNT @richarddeitsch @BillSimmons Daryl Morey is the man. I LOVE Barkley but my God is he dumb on this.
@MoveTheSticks Abdullah a good candidate as a Le'Veon backup for Steelers?
@GoodmanESPN Way too many timeouts. 1 less would be nice.
@Jason_J_W @CSBDI1Hoops Wow
@KingzJameis Scott Brooks Shoulda been fired a long time ago
@KingzJameis I wouldn't play McGary for scoring
@KingzJameis Perkins stinks. Collison &amp; Adams can D. McGary is like you out there. A hustling beasting animal.

@richarddeitsch @CollegeGameDay @thedamefan Desmond Howard really needs to go. Good opportunity for that right now.
@richarddeitsch @CollegeGameDay Wonder if good time for any other Game Day changes? I LOVE Corso but less might be more, only in last 1/2 hr
@richarddeitsch @ESPN_ReceDavis @cbfowler @CollegeGameDay Can it mean Desmond Howard removed from Gameday? He needs to go.
@richarddeitsch @ReceDavis @cbfowler @CollegeGameDay Can it mean Desmond Howard removed from Gameday? He needs to go.
That's big RT @CFTalk: Report: Rece Davis to replace Chris Fowler as “College GameDay” host 
@KingzJameis That's badass
@KingzJameis King I need your official statement on Pitt's class
@KingzJameis @CLawSoHard Thanks King #KingzKnows
@CLawSoHard @KingzJameis Either of u know how many of Pitts recruits were Pre &amp; Post Narddog? Just curious.
@CMAnderson247 @247Sports Did you factor all transfers for all teams into account for that?
@BradWright25 @CLawSoHard I personally think he lucked out but we might never know. Belichick bein Belichick.
@BradWright25 @CLawSoHard I do think by no TO he was really banking on winning or losing it right there &amp; Sea ran odd play &amp; it worked
@CLawSoHard @BradWright25 Even if banking on perfect D, ur thinkin incomplete pass, right? Then a TD or 3/4 down &amp; screwed w/ time. Tough 1
@BradWright25 @CLawSoHard That's why I did say it'd be the ultimate. And while I'm not completely on board, it really would be amazing.
@BradWright25 @CLawSoHard Not sure if on same or diff page but I simply thought call TO immediate to ensure more time for FG if need be
@CLawSoHard Ya I tend to think it was a bad move &amp; he lucked out.
Happy Signing Day. #Uge
@richarddeitsch @rwesthead GARY. THORNE.
@SACfootball JOHNELL BARNES, WR, DUKE
@SACfootball Totally forgot about my 3rd pickup. I'll make one right now if no objections.
@KingzJameis Well that doesn't look great. Just gotta get em there! And hope they don't transfer to Cal U!
@KingzJameis Didn't see. You have a link?  That's how I got in.
@KingzJameis That's big. You really are the King
@KingzJameis Wow what's PEDU stand for? You think Whitehead is gonna shock the world &amp; go to Miss St?
@KingzJameis It's on TV all day long! At least gotta check the phone all day! Narduzzi might sign them all. What happened to Givens?
@KingzJameis Gotta watch tomorrow. Hugeness. Cowart, Ivey, CeCe some big names out there.
@KingzJameis Butch Jones is doing big things. You ready for Signing Day?
@KingzJameis Wow. Looks like me trying to box you out. What a beast.
@awfulannouncing McDonough, Raft &amp; Bilas woulda been ultimate. If Raft can do NCAA, can Gus?
@richarddeitsch Too bad they couldn't reunite McDonough, Raft &amp; Bilas. That'd be amazing. If Raft can do NCAA, can Gus?
@richarddeitsch Raft is the best. Wish it was just him &amp; not Hill.
@Steigerworld Isnt Butler a non thought if Brady doesn't throw 2 4th quarter TDs? MVP just goes to last player to make play? Or best player?
@BradWright25 That would be the ultimate. Funny how bad I thought no TO was &amp; it was either best move ever or dumb luck.
@MattGlenesk Wow. 17 Joints, 12 Blunts &amp; 10 Bong Rips. The new Oscar Robertson Triple Double
@2015SBTrivia The mother fucking Soothsayer!
Wow RT @ESPNStatsInfo: Marshawn Lynch had 5 previous runs from the 1 this season and had scored only one touchdown.
@CFFGeek @BillisKing LenDale White was bigtime, though
People calling it the worst Super Bowl call ever, I'd like their 2nd through 5th worst plays, too.
@PedroFavre That's big
Wow RT @czabe: Guess Im only one who wants "One Shining Moment" montage to wrap it all up, not a COLD DUMP into the Blacklist. Thanks, NBC
@drewmagary @czabe That was pretty bad by DP
@OLGuru51 Great call
Seems like Patriots win all the time but are Brady &amp; Wilfork only 2 w/ SB wins w/ Pats?
Wow RT @khal: Internets is on fire tonight 
Unpopular opinion but Russ Wilson throwing a pass on 2nd down w/ 1 or 2 more runs after that still possible. I don't hate it.
I woulda called a TO if I was Belichick there. Still typing it. Holy pick.
@KingzJameis This game is like you from three point range...HEATING UP
@KingzJameis Wow. The King.
Remember, all experts gave higher draft grades to Browns-TRich than Seahawks-Bruce
If the @2015SBTrivia prop bet was "Is Missy Elliott dead or alive" I woulda gone dead

@richarddeitsch If @chadfordinsider is done at @espn at least it wouldnt alter their TV coverage...since they don't use their draft expert
@schadjoe What does that even mean?
Gust still in position to beat a Cormier or Phil Davis or Bader &amp; get title shot for the Jones-Gust II factor
If ur gonna fight Jones u might as well look badass against a 6'5 79inch reach guy first. Jones 84inch reach insane but still pumped for it
Anthony Johnson! Wow. That was huge.
@CLawSoHard Imagine NBA home team just showing up to play &amp; sayin "Yup, this is the ball we're using tonight"
@andrewperloff Great study. Id have no idea if big deal or not. And most complaining don't. Interesting to see you say tough to tell.
@richeisen That's great info, Rich. The public outcry...that doesnt even know how much difference there is...is interesting. Good study.
@CLawSoHard Uve been big on thinkin the regulations are oddly high, I find it =&gt; odd that game balls arent just provided by league

@PSchrags @NFLonFOX Peter, nice job but DE for Steelers is 1 position they're actually fine. Hayward &amp; Tuitt.
@KingzJameis You're exactly write, King. You booking Dixon fired?
@JonesOnTheNBA @ZachLowe_NBA @ESPNNBA @haralabob Yes, please. Lowe on main show.
@haralabob Hes by far the worst

@SACfootball Finally, some good news for the Milky Bags. Dak is back to captain the Bags in 2015
@awfulannouncing Did he? Lackluster. No big moments or calls. Weak on the promos. And I'm a Fowler fan. Just not stud PBP
@KingzJameis You need a bigtime body like yours, King
@KingzJameis Chip might like Cardale
Turnovers unusually not telling but a second cliche of Red Zone really was an enormous difference
The drops by Nelson &amp; Stanfield really swung the game &amp; if Oregon got up big who knows but over 60 minutes there was no doubt of domination
Oregon really coulda used the speed of Devon Allen, Carrington &amp; Pharoah. Felt like OSU could just swarm line of scrimmage
Urban might be unstoppable
@awfulannouncing Tebow bigtime. Galloway stinks. Need somebody to replace Desmond Howard on @CollegeGameDay next yr. He stinks, too
@KingzJameis Mariota gonna fall to 17? U still passing on him?
@KingzJameis Haha that's real good. If I was your Defensive Coordinator in life you'd tackle so many bitchez
@KingzJameis You must need a better DC
@KingzJameis You win championships
@CLawSoHard @KingzJameis DC needs to start calling plays that involve tackling. I'm totally on board w/ both of you!
@KingzJameis U think it's the DC's fault they're not tackling Cardale?
@BowlPool2014 She needs you RT @thebiglead Ohio State Cheerleader Trampled  
Ohio State OL dominating this game
Fowler needs to read promos better
Oregon not going down field at all.
Oregon drops. Ohio State fumbles. This is turning into a "What If" game no matter who wins
@KingzJameis Elliott might be too good
2 big drops &amp; 1 questionable no call define that quarter. Also the fortunate fumble bounce on flip side
That Chuck Nelson drop mighta swung the entire game
Mariota a win away from best season ever? Urban a win away from something insane?
That's gold RT @CLawSoHard: This ref looks like Buddy's dad from Elf
Oregon would be better in all white or more contrast. Some Green vs Red woulda been huge
Don't like the black numbers on shoulder pads at all.
@BowlPool2014 PAC alert

@PedroFavre @jgrace21 My boy Urban is so bigtime that he's actually gotten you two to agree on something in CFBall! That's big.
@Franko097 Shame on you
Hate pointing just to playoff record for a QB...gotta talk about the stats in those games...&amp; Peyton's playoff stats are subpar to say least
@Jason_J_W @PedroFavre @KingzJameis King, are you excited for Pitt's matchup zone offense this Fall?
Denver shoulda kept Tebow
@coachthorpe You're exactly right. Love it. Preach it.
@TheJoeMarino @draftbreakdown I could see that. What you think about him in a 3-4 like the Steelers?
@TheJoeMarino @draftbreakdown Listed at 277lbs....he looks like he's 247. What's your prediction that he'll weigh at combine?
@awfulannouncing Carey is the worst...and I still vote Simms
@PSchrags That's pretty much perfectly put
Cowboys fans that complain about losing because of a call are gonna be the greatest
Throwing on 3rd &amp; 11 for the W. That's big.
Aikman wanted to kick FG? Can't hear announcers. Wow. That's bad.
Man I still love watchin Julius Peppers
This is great RT @smartfootball: Good write up from @rodger_sherman on Patriots trick play by NE with 4 OL 
@pghmike78 Part 2 is how the stupid the 1st ballot, 2nd ballot, etc etc, suddenly on 4th ballot Player X gets voted in. U r or u arent
@pghmike78 Yes, they are. They put up the stats they put up &amp; u have no idea what other hitters &amp; pitchers took or didn't take
It's great that MLB &amp; NFL Hall of Fame stuff is so close together since they're systems are both so turrible
@KingzJameis So every QB not in the conference championship stinks?
@KingzJameis Seahawks make a lot of QBs look bad. Panthers need another WR.
Experts that ripped that Bruce Irvin pick &amp; entire Seahawks draft that year are some of the best draft moments
@KingzJameis Who u like better? Cam, RGIII or Cyler Miles
@KingzJameis Not yet King. I bet Chip would like Cam
@KingzJameis U think that little white kid from commercial is ready to take Cam's job? Cam to DE?
@KingzJameis I say Carolina drafts another WR in Top 3. A RB to replace Deangelo.
@KingzJameis This Seahawks D isn't bad, though. They have ur boy Bruce Irvin
@KingzJameis Wow. You racist?
@KingzJameis Wow. Not even a QB? I wanna see Carolina get more offensive weapons alongside Cam
@KingzJameis Not gonna get to a Supper Bowl w/ a guy like that.
Kelvin Benjamin is large
Press Virginia is a bigtime nickname/identity
@chadfordinsider This is great
The D has problems no matter who the DC is but LeBeau is 77. This is a good time to move on. It was time.
@KingzJameis Hell yeah King
@Steelersdepot Her amount of cleavage will determine that
@KingzJameis We're on the same page, as alwayz, King. Wouldn't National Champ game be so much huger on a Saturday Night?!?
@KingzJameis King, it's like you're agreeing with me but still disagreeing
@KingzJameis It really might be. I think it stinks being on a Monday
I know NFL is King but man, how huge would today be if NFL was at 1 &amp; 430 &amp; then National Champ game at 8?!?
@GoodmanESPN That's my top lineup for them. I'd like Lyles instead of Towns in that, too
@xavadevinex @Brandi_Love @nikkibenz @KendraLust I'll take a follow!

@ESPNCollegeGD Alternate jersey or actual jersey?
@andrewperloff Wow. No way. Top 3: Tebow. Mariota. Cam. All
@dmorey U think All Star should be 2 guard, 2 bigs &amp; 1 wildcard? Or 5 wildcards?
@Steelersdepot Worilds stinks. They gotta let him be overpaid elsewhere &amp; aim higher
@evansilva PI yardage should count in fantasy
@Franko097 "Joe Schmo is a 4th year...NO, WAIT, 5th Year HOFer!" "u know it's all the same, right?" "Ur right...4th Year!"
@CLawSoHard He should try his jersey on. If it's tighter I want him tested.
@CLawSoHard If Biggio can it's really only Piazza's own fault if he can't take it upon himself to get better
Let's hope Mike Piazza improves by next year
Seems crazy RT @dschoenfield: Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez never started a game against each other.
@EthanJSkolnick You just dominated @nbatv

@KingzJameis Could be targeting ur UDub boyz Shelton, Peters &amp; Kikaha
@SACfootball Burkhead. #MilkyBag
@KingzJameis They're gonna be picking close together. Eagles might snipe Steelers target in every round
@KingzJameis Need a bigtime draft for sure
@KingzJameis Who was old last night? Troy &amp; Harrison? Keisel &amp; Ike were out. Jarvis, Worilds, Mitchell &amp; CBs stink.
Long term I feel good about QB, RB, WR, DE, ILB &amp; probably OL.
No Le'Veon really changed O but Defense really lacked big stops last night. Gotta have big stops. Disappointing &amp; soft D.
5 sacks all on 4 man pressure? That's bad. Havent seen that all year.
That block by Osemele on Harrison on the Torrey TD was legendary. What a block.
Ravens underthrow causes borderline PI. Even the penalty on Archer TD at end hurt, even if likely over, woulda been a little different
114 penalty yards to 14 really hurts. Steelers go deep &amp; great throw &amp; WR too fast causes feet tangled no call.
Thats great RT @MattGlenesk: O/U on #Colts fans' bitter tweets:
Pep's play-calling: 2,387
Offensive line: 345,834
Phil Simms: 45,732,905,975
@gog382 The Suck It was pretty technically sound. I will give you that.
Instead, it was Jones w/ takedowns. DC seemed like he had nothing in 4th. Then 5th just stupid. Needed to throw bombs &amp; go for it.
Really liked DC's strategy through 3. Dirty boxing. Make it a war. Thought he'd be the guy maybe getting takedowns in 4-5
Gust rematch or Gust/Johnson winner at least needs a shot. But Cain watching in crowd. Can't help but think that's gotta happen
Jones might be GOAT. I get the elbows/shoulders/athleticism/reach, etc but maybe most amazing is his build not being able to get taken down
The hands up celebration then punch was big bitch move but guess that's expected from him
Man, anti climactic clinch Fest 5th rd but clear cut victory for sure
4 fights all to decision stinks. At least this is gonna be huge.
Coulda given me a million guesses and wouldn't have come up with Dean Pees for Ravens DC
This is like 2012 Steelers. Getting sacked. FGs. No Le'Veon.
Man, Kelechi Osemele was my boy in the draft
@pghmike78 Haha. I actually like Collinsworth. Granted, I'm at a bar right now &amp; can't hear
Man, 4th &amp; 1 from the 30 and gonna kick. At least need to make em pay.
Keenan Lewis 5-26.3. Mike Mitchell 5-25. I swear I want to stop bringing up Keenan but so many things just happen
Steelers should let Keenan Lewis go &amp; extend Marcus Gilbert
@KingzJameis That makes half of him not bad. Won't say which half, though!
That "Playoff Sack" better not drive up Worilds price
Don't you just have to take Roethlisberger over Flacco?!? Man this would be a disappointing loss. Cmon. #Uge
@KingzJameis Hahahahah. #Kinged
@KingzJameis Not that I'm aware of other then some family ordeal. You his brother?
@KingzJameis Well yeah but he'd have to sit out
@KingzJameis Strike the iron while it's hot I guess. I think he should transfer to a D2 school.
If Jones just mashes u really wonder when he'll ever lose. Gust rematch needs to happen. Rumble? Heavyweight showdown w/ Cain biggest ever
If the NFL had @DeanManifest &amp; @Alfs11thFinger's Callout System the Cowboys totally woulda called out one of these teams.
A Cormier win would be so sweet.
Jones looked vulnerable enough against Gust &amp; Cormier has had enough success against Big Foot &amp; Barnett that anything is possible
It's like u can't pick against Jones but yet Cormiers skill set of taking to ground is exact thing that could work
This Jones Cormier fight tonight is gonna be one of the biggest of all time.
My boy Kelvin is a start but within the next 2/3 years I'd really like to see Cam have some weapons
@KingzJameis Mel Kinger, Jr! I love Bucs taking QB 1st to pair w/ Mike Evans.
@KingzJameis That's true about Julio package. You booking Mariota not going Top 2?!?
@KingzJameis Mariota would have to fall. Nobody is trading 1st pick for 20th pick, a 2nd &amp; a 2016 1st
@KingzJameis Not even sure that's possible. 10 firsts?! They're too low. Maybe if they were closer to 10th.
@KingzJameis Chip gonna pick hugeness?
@KingzJameis Somebody to redshirt
@KingzJameis WOW. #KingzAlwaysKnows
Wouldn't mind Dante Fowler 17th to Steelers
@KingzJameis U booking that?!? #KingzKnows #BookIt
@KingzJameis Who's better, Swoopes or Cyler?
@KingzJameis Timmy Irvin could be big at DB. U think Jerrod Heard at QB or a new guy? U believe in Chuck Strong?
Florida has the worst WRs ever. To quote Sir Charles, "Ike Hilliard &amp; Reidel Anthony are rolling over in their graves right now"
The worst part of "The Decision" mighta been how everybody says "Takin my talents to" now
@jimwexell Eh, ya, likely, but still like to look at them &amp; consider. We need a beast at OLB so bad.
@jimwexell I've seen ur thoughts on Owa, what are DEs u like in 1st Rd at OLB?
@jimwexell Understand the principle but man, 6'2 260. He's not a typical college LB. Thought he played a lot on line, too.
@KingzJameis Is ur favorite UDub player #20 on defense??
DBack gonna be a convo of it's own for Steelers Draft but I'd be on board w/ Minn TE Maxx Williams &amp; 94 for UCLA Owa Odighizuwa at OLB
@CLawSoHard @KingzJameis @jefflaw4187 You're making BIG moves King. #KingzAlwaysKnows
@richarddeitsch Used to really dislike Joe Tess when he was w/ Gilmore but Tess &amp; Brock Huard are great. Huard is outstanding.
Wow! RT @Eagles: Eagles Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie announces @KingzKnows elevated to Executive VP of Football Ops.
@Frankussc Oooooh shit RT @Franko097: If Rondo can't make it work in Dallas, you probably don't want him.
@richarddeitsch @FOXSportsLive I really like Petros &amp; Klatt. Clay Travis gave some nice thoughts.
@KingzKnows Chip shoulda gone to Florida. Mullen shoulda gone to Pitt. Miss St only 7 returning starters next year.
@KingzKnows Maybe Eagles can bring in ur boy House at DC.
@Franko097 @jgrace21 @BradWright25 Ya more off field stuff that May or may not matter. Tough as a fan to even know.
@KingzKnows EXACTLY
@Franko097 @jgrace21 @BradWright25 I heard he had some interesting comments post game yesterday which make me wonder if he's oblivious
@KingzKnows But what about Oregon St in 2008?!?!?
@Franko097 @jgrace21 @BradWright25 He definitely needs contacts
@KingzKnows Who'd they loose Chip too?
@KingzKnows Ha Tyron looks nice but I don't like LSU, King!
@jgrace21 @Franko097 @BradWright25 On field only, though? Consoling Dalvin after a fumble. Gives teammates faith he's got it.
@Franko097 @BradWright25 Off is just such a wildcard. Tough evaluation.
@Franko097 @BradWright25 I agree w/ how sweet Jameis is on field. Just looks like he's always got a chance. And a leader.
@Franko097 Ya I figured no change in those rankings but just checking over everyone else, too
@Franko097 U still all in on JWinston 6th?
Heres whats great about ESPN. They praise SEC. Now they have graphic 'SEC Struggles'. Theyre 5-5 w/ 11th team up 28 points! @richarddeitsch
I nominate Rod Gilmore as worst analyst in college football. @richarddeitsch
The early TO after 2nd down was so bad, though. So much time left for the FG. Too much TBoyd.
I said it for Eastern Michigan &amp; I think it for Houston, going for 2 at end of Bowl Game is great
Why did Houston call a Timeout right away? Clock management boggles my mind
@smartfootball @ChrisVannini He's not wrong &amp; I agree w/ the point but they lack quality wins. Woulda been on par or worse than Baylor
@zkfanks @aoutrakis @frankt1643 Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In! Va-Rize-In!
Should Cardale transfer to like Bama St, put up monster numbers, have this impressive streak against bigtimers &amp; come draft be 'Culpepper'?
...Great thing about now is whether it's OSU, TCU, Baylor or a Boise, if u beat TWO top teams in a row it's tough to hate
I used to hate the thought of a Boise getting to BCS Title Game, getting some lucky breaks &amp; being crowned champion....
8 conference games when u have a conference of 12 or 14 is just dumb. Be like the PAC 12
12/13 games, especially when some vs Bums, just so hard to really know. Really wish all Power 5 played 9/10 conf games &amp; 10 Power 5 teams
Now Baylor &amp; Mich St was incredibly close yesterday but everyone still programmed to think 11-1 &gt; 10-2
Baylor ALWAYS mentioned. Michigan St NEVER mentioned. (By me, included). But Bay lost to WVU &amp; 3-0 vs Bums. MSU lost to OSU &amp; Oregon.
Thought Oregon separated themselves from other 1 loss but was Bama's body of work really different from OSU, TCU &amp; Baylor?
I do think in future yrs the SEC shouldnt get a pass. I had Bama 3rd (FSU 1st so clearly off).
I did like what my boy Petros Papadakis said last night "Man, we wasted a lot of time this yr talkin about the Mississippi teams!"
SEC West went 28-0 in reg season NC. Wins over KSt, Wisc, WVU &amp; Boise &amp; their bottom 2 teams were Ark &amp; AM. That's still pretty good.
TCU mashing &amp; Baylor-Mich St's awesome game combined w/ Ohio State's Win hopefully has people wanting 8, not complaining about 4th
BCS Projected Final of FSU - Bama makes this 4 Team Playoff look so sweet right now
I was rooting for an Oregon - Ohio State final. Pretty huge it's gonna happen.
If Cardale Jones turned out to be 42 years old I'd believe it
@KingzKnows #KingzKnows RT @KingzKnows: alabama is going to win by 50
Urban
Nessler &amp; Blackledge have been real good. @richarddeitsch
@Jason_J_W Wow. Yes. Wish Verne/Gary &amp; Gus/Charles could get involved
@Jason_J_W I think all 5 could almost be in any order then Pasch/Griese 6th.
This is huge
@Jason_J_W I think McDonough/ Spielman number 1.
@Jason_J_W Maybe you're right, flipping to the Taxslayer Bowl could be huge right now
Arby's!!! What a tweet RT @Arbys: If you're loving this game, we've got a few desserts you might enjoy. #Turnovers #OREvsFSU
@jpogue1 Too good is right
@CFD22 Can't believe Nebraska didn't go after Frost
#Uge RT @jpogue1: just think- if we are in BCS era, Oregon is the odd man out. Playoff = good!
I don't know if it's Helfrich or Frost or what but I love when Oregon calls identical play but fakes the short &amp; goes deep. So big.
Oh man shoulda gone onside!
@BowlPool2014 TE O'Leary doesn't wear gloves. That might cause a Pac Boner, too.
That's so badass going for two
The @BowlPool2014 is on fire. Big night of PAC ahead
@jpogue1 FSU just has that thing about them that until they lose it almost seems like they can't
Is Oregon too good or is Florida St simply unbeatable?!?
This Rose Bowl is huge.
@GSwaim Exactly. 6 worthy teams. 4 spots.
@GSwaim Texas A&amp;M. Know you said just about but 2-4 w/ Bama left, and SEC East doing well.
Granted, I'd personally think there were 6 teams for 4 slots regardless of Bowl outcomes
I hope Baylor holds on for big W so it's not narrative "TCU shoulda been in over OSU" it's factual "There were 6 teams for 4 spots"
Love when announcers think it's ridiculous to go for 4th &amp; 1....then it's a 53 yard TD run
Fowler is "solid" but ranks near bottom of the NY6 PBP guys. And that doesn't even count Gus &amp; Verne. @richarddeitsch
Pasch-Griese by far the worst of the NY6 announcing tandems. Gotta rank them. Tough. @richarddeitsch
@Jason_J_W U know what, think I disagree. 3 now + Hockey. 2 mega later I dont wanna flip from. Kinda weird but will love it tomorrow
Maybe it's just the Kraut, though #KrautMe
@BowlPool2014 Here I am thinkin I picked Sconsin &amp; then I look &amp; have Auburn! I shoulda just gone opposite
Feels like @PedroFavre should be coming over the house to watch games all day like the old days!
Now we have some action early on &amp; TWO mega games. I'm pumped. #Uge
The BCS Champ Years was nice to add that game but it made a following Monday big &amp; while good games on NY they lacked the importance
This #CFBPlayoff has definitely done 1 thing in my mind...make New Years Day HUGE again. Im pumped for today.
@WojYahooNBA Outstanding
@KingzKnows Happy New Year King. Here's to another year of bein my boy.
@KingzKnows A freight train named Kingz?
Brent &amp; Jesse are bigtime. @richarddeitsch
@KingzKnows Looks like Mullen wishes he was in Oakland
The @BowlPool2014 is feelin it
Boise shoulda gone for that 4th &amp; 1. It's a bowl! Zona still woulda needed 8. And if they did, more time left for FG
@jpogue1 U think being halfway in the goal counts as in the crease?
@GSwaim You think ACC &amp; Pac 12 going to 16 each?
@GSwaim Boise even a possibility for Big 12?
McDonough &amp; @chris_spielman are so great. @richarddeitsch
@jpogue1 Ha. I like it.
Who TCU should blame for not being in playoffs: 1)Themselves 2)Baylor 3)Selection Committee #CFBPlayoff
@BowlPool2014 I'm also thinkin GTech is gonna take it to Miss St, then I look at my #PacPool &amp; see I have opposite.
@BowlPool2014 I love that u skipped the Md-Stan game. Not good enough for Pac!
@richarddeitsch Sources! Aka one person legit heard that &amp; everyone else pretended to
@coachthorpe What u think Millsap goes for this offseason? Still wish Rockets coulda got him 2 yrs ago.
@KingzKnows Who u booking in CFBPlayoff?
Needed that WVU-Tennessee matchup
@richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing @espn Liberty Bowl has an ACC Ref (Riley Johnson) in the booth that gives ... 
@Franko097 That'd be huge. CANNOT lose to Flacco
Which is also why I'm not big on the 'Worst Loss' criteria in CFBall
But meanwhile, I think losing to them &amp; beating Colts &amp; Bengals 2x makes them much scarier than if it was reversed.
If this was CFBall Steelers would get pounded for "Bad Losses" vs Bucs, Jets &amp; Saints.
@Franko097 That's big. You're more into reading into that stuff than I'd be. Big offseason.
@Franko097 Ya, I mean it's not perfect but I just wouldn't act like he couldn't be thinkin 'HE STINKS' if he said either of those
@Franko097 Doesn't he have to say that??
@richarddeitsch Howard is the worst. Kanell not great either. Rest are solid.
@KingzKnows Were u rooting on the Steelers tonight?
@SherwoodStrauss @Franko097 Wow
@KingzKnows Wow. Mariota getting #Kinged You've got #disrespect
@KingzKnows Wow. Booking a bust?!?
@KingzKnows Wow. I'd guess Leonard Williams first D player to go. But I'll book Mariota.
@Franko097 GSmith. The Future!
@KingzKnows Need you to book the first pick right NOW!
@KingzKnows Looks like Bucs will have choice of whoever they want after all.
@KingzKnows Ya I said non-QB for Raiders. That means not a QB. Maybe Rams will move Aaron Donald to OL
@KingzKnows That's big. Ya Jets need. Bucs. Bears. Rams. I think Jags &amp; Raiders take non QBs.
@KingzKnows They need young QB so bad. Mariota &amp; Winston both could be huge. Who u think WILL take a QB??
@KingzKnows U booking Jameis?
@KingzKnows Lenny Williams? Amari Coop? U don't think Bucs would take QB?? Who they taking?
@KingzKnows Wow. U booking that? Why not? Mettenberger? What they taking?
Can't believe Bucs winning. Mariota &amp; Mike Evans would be so sweet.
Trivia Crack. #Uge
@CLawSoHard @Frankussc Was kinda 'Thoughts we thought then are looking true so far'
@CLawSoHard @Frankussc Oh yeah, we both gave thoughts like that. Not like their record couldn't be worse either.
The @Frankussc &amp; I agreeing Cavs shoulda kept Wiggins. It's a Kwanza miracle
@KingzKnows Were they arguing Narduzzi vs Mullen?
@KingzKnows Wow. You saw a fight at the mall?
@fredwvu Wow. Sounds like you've got a hardywood. And enjoy the beer.
@KingzKnows Merry Christmas to you, King! #Kingmas
@gog382 Days 1-48 of Christmas 
@haralabob What u think of this McHale extension?
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows Better be our annual 1 year subscription renewal of being best friends
Larry Timmons 1st Pro Bowl. Seems weird.
@KingzKnows Sources: KingzKnows just spotted near Boston Bridge taking presents to car
@BowlPool2014 #PACtionFactor
@BowlPool2014 I see all the joints you're gonna smoke but where are the teams?
@KingzKnows Could be a dynasty in the making
@KingzKnows Jim Tressel?
@KingzKnows Can't believe Pitt's gonna hire your tied for last candidate.
@WhiteshoesFoos Forte (1) BMarsh (4) Dez (3) Kelvin (7) are leaders in clubhouse #Whiteshoes2015Keepers
@WhiteshoesFoos Congrats @jgrace21 on joining the club!
Gotta ground that. Bad TO.
My boy Carlos Dunlap
@Jason_J_W @KingzKnows @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre Should go after Calipari if they weren't so cheap
Pacman's still got it
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre @Jason_J_W That's awesome, King. No best! All have problems! Except Dan Mullen &amp; Vince Lombardi!
@CLawSoHard @PedroFavre @Jason_J_W 2)Could always get a lifer like Bill Stew that stinks, fired &amp; dies within 5 years!
@CLawSoHard @PedroFavre @Jason_J_W 1)If guy is awesome &amp; leaves the program should attract good candidates or have good assistants.
@CLawSoHard @PedroFavre @Jason_J_W Gotta go w/ Claw &amp; Tunnell on this one. Get best hire. Never know what will happen.
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows Their the entire state. They should be way better than just Oregon. In 2013.
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows We should really focus on what's important here. And that's the 2013 Oregon St offense.
@KingzKnows Jarvis Landry is really really good. Alfred Blue has been solid. Mettenberger got snaps as rookie.
I woulda guessed Joe Cocker was 75 20 years ago
@KingzKnows I don't care if they were supposed to be good. LSU has rookies that are flat out BEASTING in the NFL right NOW
@KingzKnows What rookies does Oregon St have tearing it up in the NFL this year other than Cooks?
@KingzKnows Shoulda averaged 80 points a game! Like you in #Lawball
@KingzKnows Bama is 1 team! Tore ACL in final game.
@KingzKnows Beckham, Landry, Hill, Alfred Blue &amp; Mettenberger last year. Shoulda averaged 80 points!
LSUs offensive coordinator should be fired
So good RT @footballfacts: 
@KingzKnows Colorado St hires Georgia OC. U love it??
@Jonathan_Feigen Who would start if healthy, TJones or JSmoove?
@BradWright25 @Rwjohnson32 @Frankussc @YinkasPostMoves Smoove is Cat's BOY
Kang! RT @JonHeymanCBS: pirates won bidding for kang
@PedroFavre @danawhite @Rampage4real Wow. Yes. Get Rampage vs Darrill 'TITTIES' Schoonover in his UFC return.
A @pigbete1?!? RT @fredwvu: Drinking a Petrus Winter #9 by @BrouwerijDB - 
Cam Heyward is an animal
I'd kick. Field position at end of half doesn't matter. And 27 seconds left, good chance you'd kick FG even after converting
@danawhite @Rampage4real Should be part of Rampage's contract to not fight wrestlers! Only brawlers!
@richarddeitsch @sinow Tom Jackson's comments on Tebow &amp; Manziel ironic &amp; disgust me because it's mainly HIS channel that brings that on
@richarddeitsch @sinow Bigtime article. Doc, @NBAonTNT &amp; @CollegeGameDay are the best. Love @chris_spielman &amp; Sean McD getting recognition
@KingzKnows That's big
@KingzKnows U gotta believe. Think you still need a QB or back to Foles?
@KingzKnows Does he stink? U thinkin draft yet?
@KingzKnows Dang King
@KingzKnows King, u ok?
@jgrace21 @WhiteshoesFoos @Franko097 It was over before it started
@KingzKnows If it's Narduzzi would you King every girl in town?
@BruceFeldmanCFB Wanted him at Florida
@KingzKnows You're the greatest. I bet Mullen asked for 5 bucks over what Pitt was offering &amp; they wouldn't budge
@KingzKnows Maybe Christ was brought to Pittsburgh to deliver you Joey Rudolph?!?
@KingzKnows Why not? Why would you be anti him before he even starts (or hired!)?
@KingzKnows From Charleroi. Married to Weirton girl. Carnegie Mellon. NFL exp. Ohio St, Neb &amp; Wisc. Doesn't sound turrible.
@dbascone @BowlPool2014 Dbas@dbas.dbas looks decent on paper but it's really amazing to say dbas at dbas dot dbas.
@KingzKnows Wow. U hate? Not ur boy? CHEAP? Don't like Continuing what they've got going on? Don't like his red nose?
@jmdell639 @WhiteshoesFoos Wow. I gotta look at my lineup.
This guy is the man RT @BruceFeldmanCFB: #ULL coach Mark Hudspeth is stronger than most of his linemen:

@Jonathan_Feigen Thanks!
@Jonathan_Feigen Apologize if uve said 100x but is today last day for Lin exemption? So Brewer trade now or never?
@KingzKnows What u think? RT @RichieWalsh: Pitt will talk to Holiday and Narduzzi. Bradley and Schiano not expected to get interviews.
@KingzKnows Turrible. Was up so big. Now getting mashed.
@BillSimmons Disappointed w/ @jalenrose on @grantland33 show. Need Bill, @ZachLowe_NBA &amp; @ryenarussillo. Maybe some @1TomPenn. @Frankussc
@KennyGonzo NOG! RT @MaximMag: How to (and not to) spike #eggnog. We tried everything so you wouldn't have to. 
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre Id obviously make a run at DanMullen. If LBJ can come home, so can Megan Mullen. Dans the man
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre You're really Kinging me hard. I'm ready to book Mullen as next coach. #FeldmanzKnows
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre Wow. That's homework. I take back the #disrespect but still doubt. He is sweet, though
@Frankus NOT exactly an Oden-sized package RT @WojYahooNBA: Boston &amp; Dallas discussing package including Brandan Wright, Jae Crowder &amp; a 1st
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W @CLawSoHard @PedroFavre Man, King. From Philly. At Miss St. I'm gonna #disrespect that idea

@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W UR BOY PEDERSON
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W Fuente QB in college then coached QB, RB &amp; OC before HC
@Jason_J_W @KingzKnows PJ Fleck &amp; Justin Fuente come to mind for that criteria.
@Jason_J_W @KingzKnows Wow. Jeremy Pruitt. He's 40. I learn from u King every day. Teams are on big kick for HC experience.
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W Maybe ur boy Kiffin. I don't even know who LSU &amp; Georgias coordinators are.
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W I heard Bama has good DC. I think Kirby Intelligent. Ur right, tho. Fla new staff Aub DC fired. Not much at LSU/Ga
@KingzKnows @Jason_J_W It really comes down to #KingzBoyz but that's a bigtime outlook.
@Frankussc Ya NO IDEA what someone would give up. If ur Celts do u take any assets since he's gone? Or hold on &amp; try to keep unless big deal
@Frankussc More or less than u like talking about trading rondo?
@KingzKnows Is Fuente ur boy?
@Frankussc U love? Collison, B-Mac/Stauskas &amp; 1st? RT @ChrisMannixSI: Keep an eye on Sacramento for Rondo
@KingzKnows John Smiley?
@KingzKnows Wow. Not even George Smith? I'm still waiting for your Top 5
@KingzKnows Schiano. Doc. Rudolph. Narduzzi. Rhoads. Wanny. Sunseri. George Smith. Cowher. Bradley. Some bigtime candidates.
@richarddeitsch @SInow Klatt? Kapler? Onrait/O'Toole? Moss?  McGrath? Tebow?
@KingzKnows King, u upset, pissed, happy or optimistic about Chryst gone?
@KingzKnows @BradWright25 That's why you're undefeated in life, King
@BradWright25 You got bigtime shoes. But I did wonder if many Pitt fans would think this. Chance for an upgrade for sure.
@jennydialcreech U have even a guess when he might be back?
@richarddeitsch @AlexiLalas @SInow Wow. Terrible move by @FOXSports1. Lalas loses all credibility. He's the worst. Devastating.
@BruceFeldmanCFB @ThayerEvansSI What u thinkin for rest of staff? T-Rob? Lawing?
Who's Gruden's favorite Bear? Alshon Jefferies or Ryan Munday?
@richarddeitsch @Ourand_SBJ Millions &amp; millions of dollars &amp; Gruden doesn't know "Jeffery" isn't "Jeffries"
@WhiteshoesFoos No doubt Ken Stills gonna have huge game tonight. Forte 40 yards. KJs vs Flush in finals.
@KingzKnows Need Foles. Sanchize stinks
@KDPomp @MikePereira Should be reviewable
Good. I like this. RT @JayGlazer: NFL will experiment by narrowing width of goalpost from 18.6 ft to 14 at Pro Bowl. Been same since 1920!
@schadjoe Shaq Thompson shoulda been top 10
Man, Andre Ware was my boy
@KingzKnows At least need your top 5 predictions!
@Jason_J_W Wanny or Bust?
@KingzKnows How bout Bo Pelini?
@KingzKnows @PedroFavre King payz big buckz for that forum access! Posted on site by user name KingzNose. No relation.
@KingzKnows King, they might not win a game in the next four years if they don't keep Whitehead
@BradWright25 @PedroFavre Ya that was my thinking. This offseason it seems like a Rhoads w/ HC exp would be valued over hot shot asst w/o
@KingzKnows @BradWright25 @PedroFavre For record I just meant maybe get a Top Asst that ud think u couldn't have. I really have no idea.
@BradWright25 @KingzKnows @PedroFavre Oh yeah, Scotty Frost is all you, Cat. I really thought he was slam dunk at Nebraska
@BradWright25 @KingzKnows @PedroFavre Feel like Muschamp &amp; others sucking, big kick now is 'HC Experience' so maybe Pitt could get one?
@BradWright25 @KingzKnows @PedroFavre Haha, just an example of an asst that I thought could go big but then rumored for Tulsa types
@KingzKnows @PedroFavre U booking that, King?
@PedroFavre @KingzKnows @BradWright25 I keep being surprised that top assts (Scott Frost 4 Neb job) ARENT bein considered. Maybe Pitt could?
@PedroFavre @KingzKnows Ruuuudes.  Rooooweds.
@GoodmanESPN Might help their rotation. I've been saying all yr they're better w/ Ulis or Booker in over a 3rd big
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Wow King. Can you believe Claw's rankings? They look serious. Wow.
@KingzKnows Ha. You're the man, King
@KingzKnows Thought u booked Kirby
@KingzKnows Who are your Top 5 guesses/candidates King?
@Frankussc Pregnant Pam was real hot
@SACfootball  #SACPreBowlPickups 1)Chuck Nelson, WR, Oregon.
@pghmike78 Haha. I suppose that's better than nothing
@pghmike78 Ha don't know about that but you really gonna be there??

@Franko097 @jgrace21 Extremely weird
@Franko097 Ya good stuff
@jgrace21 Wow. Good point. Wow.
@Franko097 I meant CFBPlayoff Top 4 but yeah, I think Amari enters that Draft Top 4/5, too.
@Franko097 What was your Top 4?
@Franko097 W/o dissecting 3/5 need QB so need to be higher than 1. Winston more proto. Mariota freaky &amp; character. Either seems worth shot
@Franko097 Do u like Mariota enough to be happy w/ either in top 5?
@jefflaw4187 That makes me so happy. All is right in the world.
@Franko097 U need this RT @smartfootball: Believe RT @NFLonFOX: The race for the 1st overall pick is heating up. 
@KingzKnows Needed pick 6 there. You woulda taken that to house.
@jefflaw4187 Every time I see a preview for Backstrom I imagine you're super amped up. Please tell me you are.
@Franko097 Wow. Yes.
That's great RT @JasonLaCanfora: Jeff Fisher sent out 6 players from RG3 trade haul for coin toss.
@KingzKnows You'd make an incredible mall Santa Clauz
@KingzKnows 10 1st half points?
@KingzKnows No doubt. I need Eagles Defensive TD.
@KingzKnows U ready for Houston?
@KingzKnows That's real big
@KingzKnows Wow. Disrespect. You're just bias because they have ur mountaineers in the conference
@KingzKnows Big 12 is a bigtime conference
@KingzKnows That's big
@KingzKnows Need you on the committee. Who's your 4?
#CFBPlayoff Arguments I agree w/: 1)Better conference 2)Better 1-12/1-13 W/L this year
#CFBPlayoff Arguments I agree w/: 1)Better conference 2)Better 1-12/1-13 W/L this year
#CFBPlayoff Arguments I dont agree w/: 1)Mentioning Last Year 2)Worse Loss 3)What the rankings were last week
Wow RT @czabe: Clip n' save. 
@Jason_J_W YOUR BOY RT @CFBONFOX: Our Dave Wannstedt predicted the @CFBPlayoff back in August! #BANG  
@pigbete1 My point ive made is that good chance TCU/Baylor in same division then Baylor woulda played...KSt yesterday (or an Okla)
@pigbete1 Conference championship w/ 10 teams would be nice
@pigbete1 Ya. BYU &amp; Cincy leaders in clubhouse. USF/UCF mentioned. Really think it only helps perception &amp; narrative...but that is important
.@jpogue1 Totally agree. Zero discussion. Oregon 9 con games, MichSt, Revenge on L, 1 L, 1 game within 10. Bama 8 con, WVU, 1 L, 3 within 10
@pigbete1 Funny thing is I dont think itd actually change much. But perceptively &amp; narratively it would so I do think they'll try to add 2
@GSwaim If Big 12 had Title Game dont u think it mighta been....Baylor-Kansas St yesterday?!?
@BrazilPool2014 Let's up the entry fee &amp; get rid of the chumps! #PacPool
@BrazilPool2014 Wowowowowowoowooow. Change the Twitter Handle!  It's Time!!!!
#CFBPlayoff Even if not perfect now I think/hope Baylor left out will be good for future College Football &amp; scheduling
#CFBPlayoff Funny thing is if Big 12 had Con Champ it mighta still been Baylor-KSt yesterday &amp; TCU wouldnt have played at all yesterday
#CFBPlayoff Wow. 4-5-6 exactly how I had it. That's big.
#CFBPlayoff (Other than beating WVU) Amazing to think if Bay scheduled a Md, Utah or UNC over Buffalo they might be slam dunk in
@Jason_J_W Did I hear ur boy Wanny had Bama, Oregon, FSU &amp; OSU in July?
@andrewperloff Totally right on this one. Almost like they know it's a gimmick &amp; like that
@jpogue1 Ha. It's frustrating to talk about, isn't it? But yet I can't stop.
#CFBPlayoff As bad, stupid &amp; pointless as the Weekly rankings are, if they didnt exist, ESPN would have an equally turrible Joey Playoffs
@Jason_J_W That always spells "D-E-A-Z-A"
@schadjoe When's the first year it COULD go to 8?
@Jason_J_W Ya. Pathetic. If u woulda said Eye WITH glasses on, it mighta swung me.
@Jason_J_W That's big. Penalizing Baylor for eye test or non conf?
#CFBPlayoff Funny thing on seeding: if I had to put Vegas-like odds on teams Id say Bama 1st, FSU/Oregon 2/3 &amp; other team 4 &amp; that's likely
@KingzKnows 1)Cal U 2)Washington 3)Pitt 4)McKeesport #KingzCFBPlayoff
@Jason_J_W Who's your Top 4?
@jjmmss99 @Jason_J_W Now that's big. #ChucksBunch #1
#CFBPlayoff Wish there was a way to mandate 10 Power 5 opponents to be eligible for playoff. And all should have at least 9 conf games
@CMAnderson247 I disagree. Head to Head Factor, then NO non-conf opponents factor for the winner. OSU isn't a slouch. Cant say that as fact
#CFBPlayoff 1 thing if TCU in. I clearly dont think Miss &gt; Bama or WVU &gt; Bay so it is possible to think TCU &gt; Bay &amp; Bay's fault they lost
@jpogue1 Ha, oh yeah. Feel like people treating them as if they won 9 conf games close in bad conf then played 4 nobodies. But not true.
@jpogue1 I agree w/ this, too. Hate to care TOO much about order but narrative of FSU totally ignores Florida, Ok St &amp; ND as opponents
@jpogue1 Totally. Really is all circular.
@Jason_J_W Yes, all my 'theories' were same before yesterday then pretty much carried through with all winning
@jpogue1 But you're right, hold onto 21 point lead &amp; TCU is Top 4 without question
@jpogue1 Ha ya, if Baylor lost 1 more game, it woulda totally helped TCU, wouldnt have been the comparison &amp; coulda been in over OSU
#CFBPlayoff But seed em how u want, gotta win 2 against 2 great &amp; worthy teams
#CFBPlayoff If I never saw a ranking (which they shouldn't have) I'd have 1)FSU 2)Oregon 3)Bama 4)OSU 5)Baylor 6)TCU
.@cSands7 I agree. U see things like Urban vs Saban or 'What if it was Texas &amp; Okla' &amp; it clearly shouldnt be about any of that
.@jpogue1 If OSU DOESNT get in, it almost says 'Shoulda scheduled SMU over VTech &amp; you'd be 13-0 &amp; clearly in.'  Bad loss but I hate that.
.@jpogue1 Exactly. I suppose if OSU wasnt worthy I would, but they are. Bad precedent to me saying 'Go ahead, crush 3 nobodies in non conf'
@Frankussc Ya
#CFBPlayoff Basically circles back to original point that 6 are worthy, your fault you lost &amp; all just personal preference of what u like
#CFBPlayoff Big 12 is as strong as any conference, 9 conf games &amp; play everybody once. So Baylor/TCU definitely worthy teams
#CFBPlayoff Love when people bring up close games for an OSU, FSU or Baylor as if TCU shouldn't have lost to WVU or beat Kansas by 4
#CFBPlayoff Theres enough out there for OSU...10 bowl eligible opponents, better opponents records, undefeated in conf, etc to put them 4
#CFBPlayoff Id rather put a team in that went 3-1 vs VT, Cincy &amp; 2 bums over a team 3-0 over 3 bums. HATE rewarding scheduling nobodies
#CFBPlayoff TCU needed Baylor to lose like 1 other game so it wasnt competing H2H &amp; just looked like a great loss. Like Bama &amp; Ole Miss
#CFBPlayoff In a way I have TCU &gt; OSU. OSU &gt; Baylor. Baylor &gt; TCU. I can't put TCU in over Baylor, so I put OSU over Baylor as my 4th
#CFBPlayoff State your case for any team but remember, ALL teams other than FSU lost. So it's their fault. Had they won, they'd be in.
#CFBPlayoff Debating who is 4th is at least nicer than debating who's 2nd.
My (too many) thoughts on #CFBPlayoff - There are 6 worthy teams. And if u act like any 2 of the 6 are turrible then ur a bag
@DerekTysonESPN I can't go TCU over Baylor. And if I go Baylor over OSU it's like rewarding team for playing a nobody over a VTech
@richarddeitsch Ha. Great call.
@andrewperloff Id rather play VTech &amp; lose than play nobody. Then in conference 1 went undefeated and 1 lost a game. So don't say not close
@Bmorejal328 Wow. Huge. Wow.
@cbfowler Wins over GTech, Wisconsin &amp; KSt make it possible to leapfrog based on body of work but gotta be all 3 or none
Verne. Gary. SEC Championship. Georgia Dome. Doesn't get any better.
@GSwaim Ah. Good stuff. WVU to SEC, ACC or left in dark?
@GSwaim Ah, couldnt Big 12 get a network of their own at that point?
@GSwaim So why would a conference like PAC 12 want Texas if it meant no conference TV network?
@jjmmss99 @LTunnellVision @OLGuru51 @CLawSoHard I heard Chuck T will only play The Dude at Home. Scared of Dude's Home Atmosphere
My boy! RT @CollegeGameDay: Mike Singletary is today's guest picker! 

Picks are NEXT! #GetUp4GameDay
@GSwaim Until they get 12 teams? Or beyond that think it's inevitable it dissolves regardless?
@GSwaim U think Big 12 is in trouble?
@CollegeGameDay @kirkherbstreit @cbfowler @chrisfallica @davidpollack47 Cant bring up Baylor-TTech w/o TCU-Kansas. Thank u Pollack.
@KingzKnows Wow. Crab Legs. 53 TDs &amp; 2 INTs this year. I think he woulda smashed Jameis.
@KingzKnows He's a bigtime candidate. Wins by a landslide.
Marcus Mariota might be the most unanimous Heisman of all time
@GoodmanESPN I think their best lineup by end of year will include 1 or both of them &amp; only 2 bigs instead of 3.
@philsteele042 Hudspeth is the man. Woulda liked at Florida.
Barkley was just on fire talking Ferguson/Black/White. Excellent stuff. @richarddeitsch
@WPXIScott Any snow today on turnpike between Burgh &amp; Harrisburg?
@Steelersdepot Need Jumpy Geathers
@KingzKnows Ah, bigtime
@KingzKnows Who? Ur boy Kendricks?
@KingzKnows Kingz Knows man. Good stuff.
@KingzKnows That's big. U don't think the Eagles have awesome pass rush &amp; are 9-3 so it's pass rusher?
@KingzKnows So what position you think?
The Super Genius @MarkMaddenX asks 2nd most important position after QB. He says CB. I say pass Rusher (4-3 DE or 3-4 OLB). You?
@MarkMaddenX I think 2nd most important position is pass rusher. 4-3 DE or 3-4 OLB. Steelers OLBs just stink.
@BradWright25 Cant say I did either but definitely offensive mind. Former QB. Seems more pro style but CSU had big O numbers this yr
Mark Hudspeth &amp; Jim McElwain were my Top 2 candidates for Florida job. I'd be pumped about McElwain.
@DerekTysonESPN He have a very dynamic/engaging personality or no?
@Bmorejal328 The @jimmyfallon better be at your wedding, Levy
At end of day Top 4 is Top 4 &amp; gotta beat 2 other Top 4 teams if you wanna be the champ so seeding probably overrated anyway
Theoretically Im fine if undefeated team of worst Power 5 conf is ranked lower, esp if bad non conf. But Ok St, ND &amp; Florida? No way.
@DerekTysonESPN McElwain &amp; Hudspeth were my top two guys. Sounds sexy to me. Would love it.
@schadjoe @GVMcElroy Love McElwain or Hudspeth for Florida
@CLawSoHard @awfulannouncing Is he not just super solid? Never annoys me. Has great points. Knows his stuff.
@awfulannouncing Love both of those tandems. Gus &amp; Charles goes w/o saying. Brando &amp; Klatt have really impressed me. Maybe Top 5.
@cbillick Wow. Primetime matchup. Winner will be in good position.
#Uge RT @SACfootball: Congrats to @Thav916 &amp; the Milky Bags, winners of the 2014 #SACChampionship 271.55 to 203.25 over Mortgage Institute
@Jason_J_W @SACfootball Thank you. Mariota but not Prescott! One more year of Dak!
@BillFlow21 @SACfootball Thank you!
@SACfootball Wow
@SACfootball MY MUTHA FLIPPIN PLUMS. MILKY BAGS. WOW.
@SACfootball MY MUTHA FUCKIN PLUMS
@SACfootball MY PLUMS
@SACfootball My plums are tingling. Wow.
@Franko097 Ha. Then it was worth it.
Guess I coulda just waited til today was over regarding Miss St
@davidpollack47 Miss St shouldnt even be considered. 0 Power 5 Non Conf. Played Ky &amp; Vandy from East. They're behind TCU, Baylor &amp; OSU
The whole concept is tough. Was VTech loss bad. YES. But should it really be better if they beat SMU 56-0? No. @CollegeGameDay
@jpogue1 Oh I agree to that. Likewise cant hate on a FSU pounding a down Florida. It's just the Power 5 concept in general. Id take anybody
If Ohio State wins out id definitely have them over Miss St, too. @CollegeGameDay
Is a W over Minn THAT big? Not really. But I hate teams that play 0 Power 5 non conf teams &amp; get rewarded for it. @CollegeGameDay
Baylor-TCU is interesting debate...Baylor won at Home H2H but played nobody non conf. TCU beat Minn. But Id take either 4th. @CollegeGameDay
Mississippi St 4th is just dumb. @CollegeGameDay
Understand its not just Baylor vs TCU but if you evaluate all teams, miss st &amp; Baylor should be similar &amp; TCU 4th right now @CollegeGameDay
Baylor gets mentioned that they haven't played KSt yet. Well Miss St hasnt played Ole Miss yet. @CollegeGameDay
Miss St's two SEC East opponents were Kentucky &amp; Vandy. Big difference from Georgia &amp; Mizzou. @CollegeGameDay
Baylor appears to be penalized for weak out of conference. Miss St played Southern Miss, UAB, South Alabama &amp; UT Martin. @CollegeGameDay
I think Miss St at #4 is turrible. If ur gonna have 2 teams from 1 conference that 2nd team better have amazing resume. Miss St doesn't.
@Alfs11thFinger After years of giving them away as commish to the champ, I finally get to keep one. #Uge 
@andrewperloff Big Papi

Wow. That's good. RT @awfulannouncing: Happy Thanksgiving from the late-80’s stars of the WWF.

@megynkelly Wow. That guy in the blue gray tie was TERRIBLE. Guy in red tie was solid.
@coachthorpe I look forward to these tweets. Great stuff.
@BruceFeldmanCFB Thank you. That's what I've been saying. Loved the FS1 panel's

@Frankussc Shoulda never come to this. Shoulda rioted over Mike Brown the second the Cavs hired him back a second time
The @CollegeGameDay going to Ferguson?!? #GameDaySigns RT @WorldStarFunny: best sign ever lmao 
@GSwaim Why would Florida even want Gundy? Feels like it'd be lackluster hiring for them
@jpogue1 Oh yeah. Would definitely create intrigue &amp; attention!
@awfulannouncing Simms is the worst. @philsimmsquotes
This is big RT @SACfootball: Next week @BradWright25's Mortgage Institute for Men vs @Thav916's Milky Bags for the #SACChampionship
@GSwaim If Baylor is penalized for weak non conf, why isn't Miss St too? And 2 East games were Ky &amp; Vandy.
@larson8er What does 'the thanks haver' mean?
The Blue &amp; Red jerseys in UCLA USC is so huge
@jcshurburtt @RyanBartow @ThomasGoldkamp @fbrumormill I like Hudspeth &amp; McElwain more than Gundy. Freeze, too.
@jjmmss99 @Alfs11thFinger @LTunnellVision @OLGuru51 @CLawSoHard Harvard graduated from Chuck T. #ALFGamedaySigns
@CFFGeek Jaelen Strong playing?!? Playoff implications!
@cbfowler @davidpollack47 Amazing point by Folwer that playing ALL B12 teams aka 9 conf games really does stack up w/ other conferences
@CollegeGameDay @cbfowler @kirkherbstreit @davidpollack47 Mark Hudspeth. Jim McElwain. Hugh Freeze.

FS1 bottom line keeps showing cbball score of "Bob Jones".  That's a bigtime university.
@MikePereira I THINK it hit ground but man I did not see a definitive angle that proved that. Coulda been inch above ground

#Uge RT @FOXSports1: RAFT IS BACK!
@GSwaim U think Gundy is a good fit at UF? A good/top coach in general?

@GatorZoneFB @DerekTysonESPN @aschoffespn @travhaneyespn @schadjoe @BruceFeldmanCFB @cbfowler Mark Hudspeth should be next Gators HC!
@DTonPirates Do u think they should have offered that?
I saw 13 years $325 million &amp; thought @KDPomp just re-upped with @cbspittsburgh
2)If u still think Bucs shoulda done what it takes &amp; gone 5-82, u should be forced to address that in yrs 3-4-5 of his deal
1)If all yr long u said "Pirates HAVE to sign Russ Martin" what a waste that was to say &amp; now that it's done would u really have gone 5-82?
@Bmorejal328 @SACfootball I'll see you again next week!
@Bmorejal328 @SACfootball Wow. My sac is ready.
@KingzKnows Only you're worth $325 million, King
@jjmmss99 @YinkasPostMoves Wow. That's big.

@MusclepharmPres Do u have any cholesterol free protein?
@KingzKnows Auto draft?  You 11-0?
@KingzKnows You got that right. Eagles are in the zone. You hit 250 yet?
@KingzKnows You love 32 D's?

@GSwaim Who u think would be teams 11 &amp; 12?

@Jason_J_W Wanny knows
Especially when 1 is 9/9 conference opponents &amp; other is either 8 or 9 outta 11 or 13 conference opponents? @CollegeGameDay @cbfowler
Is playing 9 conf games really automatically worse than 8 Conf games &amp; 1 Conf champ game? @CollegeGameDay @cbfowler
Good point by Mack Beown. If Michigan St played cupcake instead of Oregon &amp; woulda been in Top 4, it's stupid. @CollegeGameDay @cbfowler
@KingzKnows Is TCU vs Kansas State your favorite game of the year? Tons of purple

@TribHSInsider Montour D too good. What a game plan by that stud DC they have
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard @jefflaw4187 #KingMe
@TribHSInsider @WPIAL_Insider U thinkin Montour beats USC tonight? That stud D Coordinator for Montour is gonna have a bigtime gameplan
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard What's the bet?
@KingzKnows First play I saw when I walked into bar was that TD. You need me.
Me-Big plans for Pitt VTech? @CLawSoHard - 'Heavy drinking and low expectations'
Catching up on The League. When Rafi met Randy was tremendous. Huge cameo by Stevie.
@EthanJSkolnick Less timeouts would make game so much better
@Gil_Brandt How's he as a pash rusher? Really liked him in that draft
@eerslbs Why is KC a BS team? Just curious
@DeanManifest  RT @awfulannouncing: Mike Goldberg had a Twitter meltdown after his NFL on Fox debut. 
Good thing Gruden spent the 1st Quarter making 87 Drew Brees comparisons to Austin Davis @richarddeitsch @awfulannouncing
This hurts RT @MoveTheSticks: Here’s a look at stats for the rookie WRs:

@KingzKnows Unguardable, like you in the paint. Curry went to school in ur favorite state
@KingzKnows I am an Ertz &amp; King fan
@KingzKnows Best defense ever?
Mike Carey is so bad. @MikePereira is so good.
@KDPomp I say always take a chance. Only comes out to 20. If u get to 17 it's not big difference. Always chance to break one.
@jgrace21 
@Jason_J_W @SACfootball He's way better than Radcliff!
@awfulannouncing Liked it a lot. Was nice to have as option. Would have less camera on the panel, though
@GatorZoneFB Needed to spike that &amp; set up 2nd down play
@BruceFeldmanCFB Westbrook has to catch that
@FOXSports1 This is bigtime. I'd recommend less shots of the crew.
@KingzKnows Forest Green &amp; Purple could be unstoppable.
@MoveTheSticks Terrible pass interference call
@KingzKnows What's your favorite color uni, King? Purple?
Wow what kind of play call is that on 4th &amp; 3 in Baylor Tcu game?
@Jubes419 Ok doesn't seem fitting for Purdue but can't hate on that. Can your SAC come back?!?
@Jubes419 Why yellow?
That's why Gary Danielson is the man. He identifies formations &amp; knows the plays.
That was huge
@JayGlazer @joelklatt @richarddeitsch Klatt's bigtime
@Jason_J_W Shoulda been himself
Gotta go for that. Turrible.
@Zack_Jablonski @TribHSInsider That Creely guy is a defensive genius
@pghmike78 I like manny more than Randle but just me
@pghmike78 I think I'd do it. Close call.
@pghmike78 Is Wilson &amp; then Foles ur starting QBs or who else u have at QB?
Who's Montour's D Coordinator? Guy's a rising star RT @TribHSInsider: #WPIAL Football Final: Montour 23, Blackhawk 0.
@KingzKnows King is this gonna be you &amp; @CLawSoHard this week? 
Puck dropping by midnight?
@pghmike78 @KennyGonzo Me too! I just saw advertisement. 10:00 I think?!? Freak Show! @ahsfx
@KennyGonzo @pghmike78 American Horror Story is back tonight?!?!?
WVU 3-2 &amp; lookin solid but 7 games left could. 3 home games all real tough. Away games are away game. Could go 4-3 or 0-7. Must win at TTech
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows @LTunnellVision @PedroFavre Anonymous Donerz shoulda given it away!
@KingzKnows Sounds unanimous King. Everybody wants it.
@PedroFavre @KingzKnows If you don't care imagine my interest! #Kinged
@KingzKnows Unbelievable. He was on fire. Then that.
@KingzKnows Were you giving bigtime thoughts?
@KingzKnows Wonder what ur boys Claw, Lee Tunnell &amp; Pedro Favre think.
@KingzKnows Could be real huge.
@KingzKnows That's interesting but not exactly super close
@KingzKnows Any idea where?
@KingzKnows That could be huge. I'm prob not best person to ask. There rumors? Where would it be?
@richarddeitsch Was interesting reading his bio &amp; timeline. Not just completely random. If made up he's obviously done.
@richarddeitsch I hate 'sources' for any &amp; all type of reports, from this to a coaching change. Just said maybe. I hope truth is found.
@scATX @richarddeitsch @danielgillman Maybe what he said is true
@KingzKnows Maybe ur huskies will shut them out
@KingzKnows U liking Washington state now too?
@APMarkLong What about?
@PedroFavre @PjWilliams_26 When you know, you know! That's big. Never too early to start talkin draft.
@richarddeitsch @sinow @awfulannouncing I'd put Gabe Kapler on breakout list
@CLawSoHard Weird that Smith was a 'bust' &amp; now by far best career. 3/5 RBs definitely so different within 10 years
Alex Smith doesn't even seem that old &amp; yet 4/5 of that Top 5 in Draft are looong gone...Cadillac, Braylon, Ced Benson, Ron Brown.
@KingzKnows 4-1 is big
@Jason_J_W @JColony13 That's gold
@KingzKnows U aim for perfection
@KingzKnows U hate Chip?
@KDPomp #EnditonOffense is a great hashtag, Pomp
@jefflaw4187 Can't believe that
@clintjackson1 If Zimmerman 2nd, Who's the best player there?
@BruceFeldmanCFB Complaining about fans rushing the field is so stupid. Let the fans have fun.
@KingzKnows I think Manassah Garner just caught that for you &amp; @PedroFavre
@KingzKnows Nationals Giants with some bigtime action
@KingzKnows U gonna convert to WVU fan?
@KingzKnows U officially done with Christ?
@KingzKnows Chris Peterson is pretty huge
@Jason_J_W Hahahahaha
@KingzKnows Wash has some studs. You're right, though, total toss up for who is nationz best.
@KingzKnows Might be Pitt or Washington
Power Ranking College Football Announcers is tough. So many good ones.
Verne 'My gosh'. He's so great.
Verne Gary 17-17. Gus Charles 37-33. This is so huge.
Holgorsen has no clue when to use timeouts
@awfulannouncing @richarddeitsch Gabe Kapler is bigtime on @FOXSports1
@KingzKnows Could be huge
@KingzKnows I'm gonna be near Cal
@KingzKnows Woa. What's your schedule like on Tuesday?
@KingzKnows What phone u get King? kIngPhone6?
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Can buy at least one hooker with a hundred
@Alfs11thFinger Still can't believe nobody wanted to trade for Jhonny Peralta as a Plus 1 last offseason
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows No way Tabita plays for Buccos next year. #KingzLawyerz would be all over that bet
@Alfs11thFinger Clayton Kershaw is now #OnAlfsBlock along w/ David Wright
@Jason_J_W @LTunnellVision Wow. #Pumkingz
@Jason_J_W Nothing like a good ol fashioned pumping. I bet whoever u pumped wished it was by @LTunnellVision
The Third Frank Brother @Franko097 @Frankussc RT @IanBegley: Amare Stoudemire will fast for the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur this year again
@KingzKnows You've got it all figured out
@KingzKnows YOUR BOY!!!!
@KingzKnows Me too #KingzKnows #Bookit
@KingzKnows Where u booking Whitehead to?
@awfulannouncing Did u hear Simms mention the cold &amp; wet weather &amp; his pro day was indoors? Simms had no clue what he was talking about
@BillFlow21 @SACfootball Real big
@philsimmsquotes RT @Adoughty88: Did Simms seriously say it was cold, dry, and the ball was slick at Bridgewater's pro day? It was inside
Simms! RT @Adoughty88: Did Simms seriously say it was cold, dry, and the ball was slick at Bridgewater's pro day? It was inside
That was classic Simms trying to explain Bridgewater in the draft
@CLawSoHard That's huge
@CLawSoHard That's huge
Yup....I have to.... Tebow &gt; Ponder
Trying to steal 2nd when you're down 2 is strange. Lines into Double Play now Miggy hits a solo shot...woulda be tying if no steal.
@KingzKnows Wow King great prediction. You booking it? Your roommate still alive??
@KingzKnows Wow what a dbag
@KingzKnows Wow you gonna fuck him up?!? Why he like the giants?
@keithlaw Who would u have pitched Sunday?
@KingzKnows We knew it
@KingzKnows Might be time to out on Law &amp; Order
@KingzKnows Mad Bum looks untouchable. Volquez shaky.
@KingzKnows Your boy with the K already. He was looking at that pitch like me looking at you attack the basket
@KDPomp Man I thought Maaad Buuuum was easy. What you think, Pomp?
I'm still not convinced a Best of 3 wouldn't be more 'fair' but holy fuck is this huge
@KingzKnows I feel better now, King! You booking???
@KingzKnows Has The King landed at home?!?
@daldridgetnt You gotta love it, DA
@CLawSoHard @jjmmss99 @KingzKnows @Jason_J_W KING! Get home! Buccos need you watching.
@NFL_CFB @Gil_Brandt No Jadeveon in the 1st Round?
@gog382 Wow, that's sweet you were able to get in stadium and spell out 'Postseason' w/ a Gilbo Money Shot
@awfulannouncing Greenberg is solid. Williams is turrible
@andrewperloff @Rodney_Harrison Shoulda played Harrisons comments about the chiefs after wk 1 on repeat for 10 minutes instead of interview
@jgrace21 Wow. Do you currently exude Iced Americano or different go to now?
@PedroFavre How did we not go to this?!?
@CLawSoHard @jefflaw4187 Oh, yeah, I totally dont wanna do anything now &amp; wouldnt even be shocked if they went 10-6 or something
Kinda funny but I might rank Haley below Tomlin, Colbert &amp; LeBeau on who I'd have gone. How do you rank them?
@richarddeitsch @SInow Simms can announce my 2 favorite teams or 2 least favorite tms &amp; Id sign a petition. Hes the worst. @philsimmsquotes
@jgrace21 Might be too much Urban
@jgrace21 U guaranteeing Jordan Whitehead?
Really tough to grow in house talent then watch them walk away
Contracts &amp; willingness withstanding, it hurts seeing Keenan Lewis, Mike Wallace &amp; Manny Sanders all be bigtime elsewhere.
@KingzKnows You're not giving up twitter, too, are you King?
@KingzKnows Oh man King. You getting worked up? Not worth the stress. You're my boy talkin sports though
@KingzKnows Dang King. You can't.
A timeout instead of the delay of game at 42 is one of dumbest plays you can make.
How do you jump on that punt right away?
@WhiteshoesFoos @jmdell639 I'm all for fractional scoring
@WhiteshoesFoos Thoughts of going to Fractional scoring? Ie 1 yard = 1 point. 17 yards = 1.7 points.
Love these Colts formations w/ both Ahmad &amp; TRich in
#Uge RT @philsimmsquotes: NEWS BULLETIN: THERE IS NO PHIL SIMMS TODAY. WE REPEAT, THERE IS NO PHIL SIMMS TODAY.
@keithlaw Who would you go with?
@GregMadia He still has been pretty awful at clock management more than once
Yoel Romero's traps have already won. @BillFlow21 @PedroFavre #ufc178
Wow RT @SACfootball: Doesnt get much bigger than #THELOWPOSTBRAWL @Thav916 @BillFlow21 #TheSACisHUGE #MilkyBags #Zips 
@KingzKnows Washington is ur squad, King
@PedroFavre @KingzKnows They could just start LaFromboise
@PedroFavre That's devastating news
@SACfootball Wow. CJ Brown out of the game. Could be huge in the Low Post Brawl. @BillFlow21
@Jason_J_W @SACfootball @LTunnellVision NO. WAY.
Jumbo Diaz HAS to be @BrazilPool2014's boy
@KingzKnows That's unlike you to be negative
Wow. Bo Hines is white. @SACfootball
@KingzKnows Ur boy Neil with hugeness
@DwyaneFade @ESPNSteinLine Stein's article says you can't. Thought so.
@DwyaneFade @ESPNSteinLine Can you package a trade exception w/ another player (Haywood) like coulda with Bogans?
@ESPNSteinLine I thought the whole point was keeping his salary to trade. They prefer a trade exception?
Corso should just whip out his gigantic cock for this South Carolina pick #CollegeGameDay #SaturdaySelections @collegegameday
Desmond Howard is turrible @collegegameday
@smartfootball @McMurphyESPN Holgorsen making a push to get back in that list w/ this season

@PedroFavre @KingzKnows #KingzKnows
@jmdell639 @fredwvu How are you guys still standing?!?
@KingzKnows Dang dude. U woulda beasted as a safety, nailing people that came into your house
@KingzKnows Was he ur boy?
@jmdell639 @fredwvu That is huge
@fredwvu @jmdell639 Are you guys together or just drinking the sane beer?!?
@rivalskeenan His clock management is still turrible
@PSchrags @myoder84 Wow. Joe Buck.
@KingzKnows UR BOY
@KingzKnows Wow. Ur boy Neil.
@KingzKnows That's big. You're my MVP.
@KingzKnows Who would you vote for your Top 3?
@KingzKnows Would u consider Cutch at all?  Walker dead last?
@KingzKnows King, who's your NL MVP?
@awfulannouncing Oh fuck, please no. He shouldn't be on TV period.
@KDPomp I hadn't thought of it but it's a great point. Too many people focus on what he hadn't done...he's done a lot
@KDPomp If a legend like you can stay in Pittsburgh for entire career, so can Huntington!
@richarddeitsch He planning on using the word Imatool or Imtheworst?
@KDPomp Great to acknowledge. That's why you're Pomp.
@AmericasPregame Fitzpatrick yes
@KingzKnows Wow you woulda had that ball
@KingzKnows U booking a HR tonight for Neil?
@jefflaw4187 Wow. I'm in now.
@KingzKnows @jefflaw4187 @CLawSoHard If the Buccos played the Eagles who would you root for?
@KingzKnows Well they could overtake Cards. But 4th is big.
@KingzKnows Need your prediction right now what place in NL the Bucs come in. 3rd, 4th or 5th. Book it for me.
@KingzKnows Dang, need to trade for Neil Walker &amp; make him their defensive cleanup hitter
@KingzKnows Is Chip ur boy?
@KingzKnows Who all is hurt?
@KingzKnows You think they might go undefeated?
@jefflaw4187 RT @MikePereira: With an illegal touch, the penalty would  have been 5 yards and still 3rd down. Pitt should have challenged.
@KingzKnows You're the fuckin man, King
Bigtime atmosphere last night. Great day in Morgantown. Encouraged by how WVU is lookin. Oklahoma is a powerhouse. 
Kelvin just bossed Jarvis Jones wow
@PedroFavre Thought for sure it was gone or at least in gap
Stephen Tulloch! That's incredible
Bucs sucked forever. People now complain about not making trades or spending enough $. Not perfect but Bucs are set to compete now &amp; later
Buccos win 82 &amp; nobody even cares. Could finish 6th in NL &amp; be a disappointment to fans. Buccos baseball really is bigtime.
@LisaPompeani Bigtime!
@LisaPompeani Can I get a follow Mrs Pomp?!? Huge Pomp fan!
@KDPomp @LisaPompeani If only you were home plate ump &amp; sang the national anthem, too. Coulda been like Enrico Pomplazzo from Naked Gun
@KDPomp @LisaPompeani You're the man, Pomp. No doubt about that. Great to see a sweep. Buccos doing big things.
@Dejan_Kovacevic #DK3Stars 3)Rick Weeks 2)Cole 1)@KDPomp lookin real sweet behind the plate 
@KDPomp @lisapompeani Was Pompin easy in those front row seats? #TrickQuestion #PompinsNeverEasy
@LTunnellVision @alfs11thfinger He was groovin!!! @BradWright25
Huuuuuge @BradWright25 sighting! #MissionOctober 
@VerizonFiOS That's huge
Mommy? 
@KingzKnows Wow basically an apartment. Sounds bigtime.
@KingzKnows Wow. Two Eagles fans in one room.
@KingzKnows Believe King!
@KingzKnows You got a roommate this year?
@KingzKnows Do you believe, King?
@KingzKnows Dang King. U hated that pick when it happened
@KingzKnows Wow that'll be huge to get extra year of eligibility
@KingzKnows U disrespecting the Eagles D? What's up with Marcus smith?
@awfulannouncing That's amazing. Can you add Steelers?
Wow. Yes. Come to think of it, was he wearing this glove?!? RT @jmdell639: @Thav916 signaling the shocker?! 
Feels like an interesting move by this ref to go index, middle &amp; pinky fingers for 3rd Down signal
#PSQ is so great RT @philsimmsquotes: "I think if he goes for it, that's the call" - Captain Obvious checks in.
@coachthorpe Is no Offensive Goaltending possible or does it have to be all or nothing?
Calling a TO at your own 1 yard line instead of a delay of game is so dumb (Brees)
@richarddeitsch @Powell2daPeople Ray Lewis employed by @ESPN for all this is hilarious, let alone others
@smartfootball Totally. I love when he raves about how fast Driskel gets ball out (on a 5 yard overthrow) then he gets sacked next play
@CLawSoHard Sounds about right. I'm listening to Brent right now on SEC Network!
I like the move, though. Was time for Brent to move on &amp; Fowler is solid at every thing he does. CFBall has the best announcers
Verne, Brent, Gus, even guys I don't like like Nantz &amp; Buck have 'Big Game' voices. Fowler has to build to that
Think it's gonna take a little bit of time til I hear Fowler's voice &amp; think 'Big Game'
@VerizonSupport Why don't I get SEC Network in HD? (Zip 15228)
@BruceFeldmanCFB I'm a WVU alum so fine w/ all the plays but I do think it's time CFB stopped stopping the clock on 1st Downs. You?
@MattGlenesk Ya after my tweet I realized what the actual score was. Tough one.
Verne. Gary. SEC. #Uge 
@MattGlenesk Playing against Tevin Coleman in Fantasy this week! Killing me mon!
Huge win. Turrible special teams &amp; turrible clock management. Offense looks nice. I'll take 2-1 vs Oklahoma.
What the fuck is Holgorsen doing with his timeouts? Wow
@KingzKnows U have comcast or Verizon? @PedroFavre might be able to help u out.
@KingzKnows Was the Pitt game delayed due to weather or because u booked FIU a long time ago?
@PghBizTimes Turrible. Vinnies is the best. Luciano's isn't even good.
Jerseys with a word on the back (Triumph) instead of player's names are so stupid.
Holgorsen's play calling feels like a whole different level this year.
@VerizonFiOS Will Pittsburgh (15228) get SEC Network in HD? Why don't we get it?
#Uge RT @Alfs11thFinger: Congrats @Thav916 &amp; the FlexibleGooseBalls for winning the 2014 #ALFChampionship in a thriller over ManifestDestiny
@BradWright25 @Alfs11thFinger Honored to join the club!

@Alfs11thFinger I told @Bmorejal328 to walk to Camden Yards last night to resume play &amp; next I looked the game was back. #Uge
@mlbdepthcharts Are Bud Norris, Carlos Carrasco &amp; Odrisamer gonna get two starts this week?
@richarddeitsch ESPN should be (a big part) to blame for guys like Tebow &amp; Sam to be out of league instead of backups
@BrazilPool2014 #Studball
@LTunnellVision @jjmmss99 Wow
@Alfs11thFinger Wow. Shoulda kept Dilson in my lineup. Could be devastating.
@KingzKnows That's huge info. How many wins you predicting?
@KingzKnows That's a good point. How many for Ertz? I have him in two leagues
@KingzKnows Wow after Riley Cooper? That's big. Only 40 catches? Thought u might say 60+
@KingzKnows What'd u name your dog? How many catches u predicting for Sproles this year?
@mlbdepthcharts Think a starter could be skipped &amp; Kershaw goes Sunday again this week?
@synchrogemini Vinnie Pie is the best
@PSchrags Wow they gotta cut Ponder
@CLawSoHard @KingzKnows Could name it 'Nose'.
@KingzKnows What kind of dog and what's the name?
Gotta vote Vinnie Pie RT @PghBizTimes: Fourth round of #PittsburghPizzaMadness starts today. Get your votes in! 
@MCwells8710 @TimTebow Wow.
@djdinardo @donvito72 Haha. Thanks to you all.
@Jackie_Schafer @eerslbs Thanks! Probably picked wrong account to send to first! Keep up the good work.
@Jackie_Schafer @eerslbs My wedding is today. Ben Livingston is in town &amp; I told him to turn on wtae!
@eerslbs @JackieWTAE @HossStyle16 @Jackie_Schafer Might have to rely on her for how the tunnel traffic is looking!
@JackieWTAE Jackie, @eerslbs is in town for my wedding. He should put on WTAE and see who the anchor is, don't u think???
@jmdell639 Wow
.@PedroFavre I assume/hope he's easily cuttable after this yr. Im really hoping they keep Cam where he's been &amp; move Keisel, not vice Versa
@KingzKnows You'd fit right in King
@Alfs11thFinger There's no doubt former Goose Ball Kyle Gibson is going for 50 this week
@WPXITraffic Is Squirrel Hill Tunnel open this weekend?
@PghBizTimes Vincent's is by far the best #PittsburghPizzaMadness
@mlbdepthcharts Think Fiers gets 1 or 2 starts this week
@jjmmss99 @Alfs11thFinger Wow. #ChuckTd
@Alfs11thFinger I'm predicting 298-291 Chucks Bunch win
@PghBizTimes They're both turrible
@KingzKnows Wow that sounds bigtime. Snider is bringing it lately.
@KingzKnows Wow. What he do King?
@KingzKnows Disrespect
@KingzKnows It's not on KDKA?
@KingzKnows Where are you?
@KingzKnows Ya what's up?
@richarddeitsch Not an EA fan at all but never thought Pam Oliver was any good either
@KingzKnows What would you stroke out to?
@mlbdepthcharts Any chance Bud Norris starts Sunday instead of Monday?
@SACfootball @BrazilPool2014 @Jubes419 @MCwells8710 My apology. Vinegar Strokes are in! Need @Murphwvu

@MarkMaddenX Yeah, do you? Ward on middle of course is guilty of something, though
@MarkMaddenX Voting yes, intentional, but Ward walking way out onto course was really stupid
How bigtime is this beer selection... @HossStyle16 @jgrace21 Need @jmdell639 untapping 
@PghBizTimes @Pgh_Slice Slice should be DOMINATING this matchup. #PittsburghPizzaMadness
@Alfs11thFinger Can't believe no Bud Norris second start this week

Gotta throw D's &amp; Primantis on Honorable Mention, too. I love small pepperoni.

@CLawSoHard @PedroFavre That's bigtime bonding. I'll be making my annual pitch for 'Hippo Week'. Now that would be uge.
@PedroFavre @CLawSoHard While I trust Deputy truly watches, I feel its become super cool to say u love Shark Week, instead of just watching
@LTunnellVision @KDPomp Pomp is Extra Bold
@clintjackson1 2015....Williams, Dozier, Ingram? What big?
@Alfs11thFinger That was big

@SACfootball @LTunnellVision @Jubes419 @CLawSoHard @BillFlow21 @Bmorejal328 @BradWright25 @BrazilPool2014 @Murphwvu @MCwells8710 YES
Interesting about that is there's basically nothing that proves a QB playing right away or waiting means anything. If youre good youre good
Please tell me he's smooth! RT @jerrymeyer247: 2015 SF Keith Stone, will visit Florida Aug. 23 
@KingzKnows #KingzKnowsShotz
@CLawSoHard @Alfs11thFinger Agree

@sheridanhoops Wow you have Millsap and Faried as locks? I thought 1 outta 2
@BradWright25 @KingzKnows Wow
#Uge RT @AdamSchefter: Cardinals announced they signed former Steelers OT Max Starks, who's now reunited with Arizona HC Bruce Arians.
@CLawSoHard @aoutrakis  @Frankussc @Franko097 @PedroFavre Wait, Mason Plumlee might make Team USA?!? Fuckin Coach K.
@MarkMizzouSteel Oh yeah, trust me I get it. Right or wrong of Price, I believe it. I'm Bucs fan &amp; many Bucs fan act like tjat
.@MarkMizzouSteel @gog382 But the Rays have no say in this. If the Pirates make an offer, they MUST take it!!!
@CLawSoHard @beezhouse27 My main thing is til proven that Rays liked Bucs package more or what it woulda taken it's tough for me to bash
@CLawSoHard YOU WONT
@jimcallisMLB How does Adames compare to Alen Hanson?
@KingzKnows MLB Trade Deadline Day might be on of my favorite King Dayz of the year.
@KingzKnows Takes too two tango, King.
@KingzKnows Dang dude, Kingz knows, that's for sure
@KingzKnows So u think they had big trades other teams woulda definitely done but pirates decided not to because of $?
@KingzKnows U pist they didn't make a move?
@KingzKnows Ya that's what I saw. You pist?
@KingzKnows Wouldn't book it yet king
@KingzKnows You book that??
@LTunnellVision Holy cow, can't stop laughing
@KingzKnows Dang. Need more fans like me &amp; you
Love when people get mad Pirates didn't make trade that you don't even know was on table or liked by other team

@KingzKnows If Bell's involved id be disappointed. But Hansen &amp; Tabata I wouldn't care about. Jones, we'll see full details...
@KingzKnows Do u hate the trade offer?
@KingzKnows Oh yeah I always forget he's a SS. Definitely the name of an outfielder.
@KingzKnows Who's that, Hanson &amp; Tucker? Somebody else? This offer okingficial?
@Franko097 DHerrera the future?
@LTunnellVision @Alfs11thFinger Oberholtzer could be huge

@CLawSoHard @Franko097 @Alfs11thFinger 2 ideas of mine...1)Buy 2, Sell More Than 2 allowed. 2) $10 penalty for weekly #ALFLowScore
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 @Alfs11thFinger Ideas will mainly have too many negatives but for those like us that will talk, it's fun
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 @Alfs11thFinger That speaks to the benefit of selling, which kinda sucks
@BillSimmons Wow. Putting Klay in that top category
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 @Alfs11thFinger Rebuttal is owners could trade picks for players now. Then be stacked. Then players for picks in off
@Franko097 Ya I don't know. Maybe. But more keepers also means more possible keepers (ie Oscar's). Maybe Buy 2, Sell more than 2? Can text..
@Franko097 @Alfs11thFinger And I agree, I'll think of tweaks as well
@Franko097 Ya im not arguing ur plan or motives or legality but also cant argue an Oscar for Cishek &amp; Mejia is AMAZING for contender
Actually I'd predict Rose on team even though I'd tell him to stay home &amp; rest. Maybe over Beal or Parsons
Predicting Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Beal, Klay, Harden, George, KD, Parsons, Davis, Boogie, Drum
@Franko097 Ya, the +1 value is whack for trades &amp; hoping for best. And a lot can happen by Opening Day 2015. Caught offguard by Oscar non +1
@Franko097 Ya wish there was 'gentlemns agreemnt' 2 not do such lopsided in favor of contender 4 minor asset but if u didnt some1 else would
@DraftExpress Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Wall, Beal, Klay, Harden, George, KD, Davis, Boogie, Drum is my squad
@Franko097 I don't blame u, and I got Betts for Porcello. Im all about taking advantage of rules but man those trades are bad for league IMO
@Alfs11thFinger I just remembered Oscar Taveras isn't even Plus 1 eligible. Wow.
@bspecht23 Could be nice but gotta be added to roster first
@ESPNSteinLine Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Wall, Beal, Klay, Harden, George, KD, Davis, Boogie, Drum
@Alfs11thFinger It'd be nice based on MLB Trade Deadline really changing around ALF roles but overall think I'm against this.
@SpearsNBAYahoo Gotta go Davis, Boogie &amp; Drum
@aoutrakis @Franko097 @Frankussc @PedroFavre @CLawSoHard Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Wall, Beal, Klay, Harden, George, KD, Davis, Boogie, Drum
@aoutrakis @Franko097 @Frankussc @PedroFavre @CLawSoHard That was my original 12. But now no Blake or Love. Going w/ Drummond &amp; Wall
@aoutrakis @Franko097 @Frankussc @PedroFavre @CLawSoHard Curry, George, KD, Love, Davis, Beal, Harden, Klay, Blake, Boogie, Irving, Lilliard
@jjmmss99 @Alfs11thFinger A Post Trade Deadline Trade Committee would be a must!
@KingzKnows You're my boy, King
@pghmike78 @Uber @lyft I've used uber &amp; loved. No experience with lyft
Wow. A Franklin &amp; Bash reference in Suits. That's big.
@pigbete1 And to think, my drug studies in college was for stuff like migraines. Really have come a long way. Literally.
@SACfootball Wow. #MilkyBags legend RT @AnwarRichardson: Sources have told @OBWire that RB Joe Bergeron was dismissed from the #Texas team
@DickieV I prefer Wiggins to Love, Dickie V. No trade necessary. Cost effective &amp; an athletic, defensive stud
@Probballdraft No Wiggins
@Probballdraft Pay less
@pghmike78 Buccos are playing great baseball AND Dodgers are in town. Turrible.
@Probballdraft Ekpe Udoh would be nice
@andrewperloff Pau off bench. Snell &amp; Mirotic start
#Uge RT @richarddeitsch: Fox's No. 1 college football crew: Gus Johnson, Charles Davis and Molly McGrath.
@BillFlow21 Ernest Goes to the Mound is a bigtime comedy
@SACfootball I've been thinking a lot about my SAC #MilkyBags
@Dejan_Kovacevic Bigtime blogger
@DickieV Lebron, Kyrie &amp; Wiggins. Think Defense Dickie V (and money)
@Alfs11thFinger Starting Kyle Gibson over Odrisamer. Not huge.
@Franko097 @CLawSoHard Wiggins, Bennett, 1st over Lee, Klay, 1st for sure
@Alfs11thFinger Starting off #AlfMegaWeek w/ 5 hour car ride w/ the Mortgage Men @BradWright25
@andrewperloff @dpshow Wiggins. Contract is so much better than paying Klay max soon. Same w/ Bennett vs DLee. Get the cheap youth, restock
@ChrisMannixSI Bennett would be natural in trade. Think Wolves could include KevMart to rid of salary?
@ChrisMannixSI Klay I'd trade. Gotta pay him soon so just pay Kevin. Not Wiggins, though. Defensively he'll be so huge for Bron
@Jason_J_W @JoeStarkey1 Wow
@Franko097 Turrible. KevMart/SLiving/BRush more than adequate next to SCurry. Iggy &amp; Bogut D-minded. It's almost too perfect.
@PedroFavre U gotta love Blair to Wiz. What a frontcourt of beef to go w/ those guards
@KDPomp Who's your pick, Pomp? And your sleeper?
@CLawSoHard @schadjoe It's one thing if they played in reg season once &amp; that's it. But NOT a third time
@schadjoe No
@ESPNSteinLine Silver needs a twitter account
@richarddeitsch He's better at baseball than he is football. Should not be #1 football team
@KingzKnows Wow. You were my idle as a kid, King
@hoopshype 98th in defensive efficiency? Stick to updates, not opinions
@KingzKnows Wow. Jeter ur boy?
@WojYahooNBA @Jonathan_Feigen Why not Houston for Boozer? Boozer &amp; AlJeff would be so bad on D &amp; just block young development. Hawks nice.
@ESPNSteinLine @WindhorstESPN IF 4/60 should do 15.6/15.2/14.8/14.4 or something like that
@WindhorstESPN Wouldn't it be incredibly wise to do a decreasing contract rather than increasing for DWade?
@KingzKnows How good would Morneau be off the Thunder's bench?!?
Man, Morneau woulda been nice to bring back
@coachthorpe I think Cavs would be better off w/ Bennett starting &amp; Tristan as 1st big off bench. Can't overpay Tristan next offseason.
@Jonathan_Feigen Could/would they put in an amnesty bid for Boozer if amnestied?
@CLawSoHard That's a power squad but not all on the 19 man roster. All are American, though
@ESPNInsider @GoodmanESPN No, dont trade Wiggins. Wiggins can guard 2/3s all game instead of LeBron. Plus cheaper. Fill lane on breaks.
@Frankussc @Franko097 All 2 year deals is huge, though
@Franko097 @Frankussc @PedroFavre @aoutrakis @CLawSoHard 19 guys on Team USA. Need your 12 man squad.
@CLawSoHard @dmorey ..declining his offer sheet. Like that Arizas salary declines but skipping him 4 more space next yr mighta been the move
@CLawSoHard @dmorey Love the Asik move. Lin move turrible but understand fucked by Bosh. Parsons at 964k woulda been so big but agree w/...
@ESPNSteinLine @Jonathan_Feigen Doesn't signing Ariza hurt that, though?
.@dmorey is my boy but trading Lin &amp; a 1st, &amp; letting Parsons go instead of paying him 1mil might end up being 2 of worst moves of all time
@Frankussc Ed's boy was Courier. I was all Sampras. Loved Seles' boobs bouncing
@Frankussc Gritty Gutty? The female Scotty Skiles?
@JonBabs53 That's incredible
@Alfs11thFinger Bud Norris scratched start gonna be a killer today
@Jason_J_W @lynseyhipgrave1 You need, no wait, DESERVE, a Hipgrave follow (and I'll take one, too) #Hipgrave #Uge
@KingzKnows Michelle just asked when you were moving to Cleveland! Kings going home!
@KingzKnows Wow. Love to Cavs has been BOOKED
@KingzKnows U booking that?
@Jonathan_Feigen @WojYahooNBA Would they get pick(s) in addition to taking on contracts?
@Jonathan_Feigen Any chance they could get a 1st along w/ taking on Boozer?
@KingzKnows Gonna need their young guys to step up
@KingzKnows Then Reggie &amp; Adams off bench. And don't need Collison. You know who I'd love on that squad but maybe too late, Jameer Nelson
@KingzKnows Lamb, Morrow, Roberson, Huestis, Perry, Collison, McGary, Perkins. U don't like that bench?
@KingzKnows Anthony Morrow is huge pickup. You gotta have faith in Presti.
Also realized I liked LeBron more than I liked the Heat (sorry @Franko097).
@BigHouseCam Loved that video u retweeted a couple days ago. Congrats on getting him back man.
I was completely anti LeBron going back to Cleveland &amp; then all of a sudden it happened, I read his essay &amp; was cool w/ it all. I'm on board
It's really honorable that LeBron doesn't mind going home to Varejao's team
Blatt is bigtime RT @GoodmanESPN: I asked Blatt how LeBron will fit into his system. He smiled, "I think the system will change."
@Jonathan_Feigen Any chance at Greg Monroe or that not even possible bc it'd take 3 days?
@MegRSB That's possible.  Lebron adding 'DBas' to his list is definite
@MegRSB Yes!!!!!!!
@MegRSB Check Dbas' pants. Bet he's got pierogies in there.
@CLawSoHard Ya, personal preference of Young Wigg over some new 'super team', plus, Wigg at 5mil vs Love at 20mil leaves more room elsewhere
I want the Cavs to keep Wiggins so much more than trade him for Love
@Franko097 @Frankussc Too many murders left to commit to take own life now
#Uge RT @WojYahooNBA: The dominos will start to fall now.
Bosh to Houston ASAP

@KingzKnows You the Father?
@ktaylor026 @aoutrakis Could barely beat Dynasty with that crew

@KDPomp U like UFC Pomp?
@jmdell639 That was so bad
@BillFlow21 @danawhite Ha. Fair enough.
@BillFlow21 @danawhite You got other problems if you bought this for Mitrione!
@Alfs11thFinger Samardzija Sunday. That's huge!
This Krul guy is hilarious
@aoutrakis This is for you 
@Alfs11thFinger Should be illegal to be trades on a Friday when you still have a start left. Could be devastating.
@KingzKnows A's starting rotation could be huge
@KingzKnows Cubs gonna be loaded?
@KingzKnows Uncle Keith w/ big news. U love that trade?
Hulk's better looking than Ronaldo
@KingzKnows Dang King, didn't know u were going
Wow Hochuli wishes he was this dude

@Alfs11thFinger I smell #ALFTrades
@jgrace21 DO IT
@KingzKnows You drafted already?
@KDPomp 4 hour long tweet? Might wanna consult a Doctor, Pomp. The tweet was probably being huge like the rest of you.
@KingzKnows Sam Presti was spotted in Crawford Village last night looking to offer you a max contract and a poodle
@Dejan_Kovacevic Who is setting up or sponsoring the Market Square big screen? Need to keep it up &amp; play all Buccos, Pens &amp; Steelers games
@aoutrakis Wow RT @daldridgetnt: Dynasty GM @ktaylor026 was on Melo's front porch at 12:01 to make the Dynasty pitch
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 I'm the wrong person to ask bc I think Diaw would be a good fit anywhere.
@Alfs11thFinger Man Machado suspended on a Monday. That's when I could go for some Free Agent Mondays!
@BradWright25 Exactly. Then Dream Shaked.
Hakeem woulda stopped that
@Franko097 Rank KLowry, MGortat, Pgasol, TAriza, LDeng for Heat, all based on reasonable contracts
@WojYahooNBA @ESPNSteinLine Heat gave up a ton of 1sts for Sign &amp; Trades then they all opt out. Can teams stop doing that unless need space?
Greece coach should be pounding kabobs on the sideline. @BrazilPool2014
Even if that was a penalty I feel like there should be a penalty in the box that doesn't result in a PK
Still think the guy that draws penalty should have to kick the PK

Reinhart's mom is pretty bigtime, too.
This Aaron Ekblad has some bigtime hair
@bkoo Gus is the man for Hoops &amp; Football. And that's it.
@Franko097 I dont even mind his timing/pacing as much as his 'Vonleh averaged 11 pts &amp; didnt even make the tourney' repeated type of thots
@richarddeitsch Ur right. All considered the 4 main guys &amp; Fran, Katz, Goodman &amp; Penn is really solid &amp; not overkill. Jay Will turrible tho
@richarddeitsch That said, Jalen would be my first choice to go from main set
@richarddeitsch I think Simmons would be better in a role off the main set where they could go to him every 10-15 minutes to rant
@richarddeitsch @KDonhoops Ya I don't think JVG knew enough about these college players when he was on the draft.
@richarddeitsch You're right. All things considered the 4 main guys &amp; Fran, Katz &amp; Goodman is really solid &amp; not overkill
@richarddeitsch Simmons adds some nice Bball theory/speculation/cap stuff but has so many draft beliefs that he's just so off on
@richarddeitsch Dont feel like Jalen adds much. Simmons just jokes w/ him. I even wonder if Simmons is better w/o Rose? I don't know.
@richarddeitsch I'd go Ford over JVG but like the Davis/Bilas/Fraschilla idea. Too bad Rece can't be full time NBA host. Need Ford
@KingzKnows Wow. Dang.
@KingzKnows Huestis! The next Thabo?!?
@KingzKnows I want Hairston or Capela to Rockets
@KingzKnows Free Agency still coming King
@KingzKnows Thabo or Lamb? Or Is Thabo gone? Still have another pick here soon. Gotta go guard or wing
@KingzKnows He plays like you, King. Needless to say, he could be huge.
@KingzKnows Mitch McGary ur boy?!?
@KingzKnows Shabazz? McDaniels? Hairston? Who u want?

@Franko097 Your dream come true
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 I like Cald&gt;Felt, Pick34 &amp; Larkin arent bad but they really do hate thought of cleared cap (JC longest deal in trade)
@Frankussc Most 31 yr olds pit hair doesn't extend to their chests &amp; stomach. And legs. And feet.
@Frankussc Ya love that part for Knicks. Dalembert, Amare &amp; Barg will be 'enough' at Center
This Knicks Mavs deal could look real one sided when Melo signs w/ Dallas
@CLawSoHard @Franko097 On about the 68th 'Doug McDermott to Hornets' rumor Ive finally stopped initially thinkin of him spacing floor 4 AD
@DraftExpress @chadfordinsider What was/is ZBo's Wingspan? I can't find it anywhere.
@richarddeitsch The @espn TV draft coverage not having @chadfordinsider continues to be gigantic mistake. Need him in TV.
@BillSimmons The #Celts Fan @Frankussc says he'll flip out if Rondo is traded for BMac, Isaiah &amp; 8th Pick. Need it to happen.
@Franko097 Phoenix would be incredibld
@Franko097 Ya Hawks have a nice foundation of solidly paid talent that still allows for cap space
@Franko097 Been saying Atlanta the sleeper in all these bigtimers. I like seeing their name involved that they think so, too
@ESPNInsider #FORD
@richarddeitsch Which is a gigantic mistake. @chadfordinsider needs to be part of the TV coverage.

@Franko097 Agree. By Yr 2 I really mean completion of roster. In Yr 1 anywhere he goes will be a force
@Franko097 If not next year, soon, only getting banged up stopping him. He's got it all.
@Franko097 THATS the move. 2 things I think he should be more open to is 1)Not immediate (aka Yr 2 hugeness) &amp; 2)Pairing w/ youth
@Franko097 Ah, Mgasol. Had wrong team &amp; wrong Gasol. He'd be great to pair with for sure
@Franko097 Which roster? Dallas? They don't have much of a roster right now. Gasol good but for how long?
@Franko097 Calderon, Monta, LeBron &amp; Dirk would be uge
@Franko097 You consulting LeBron to go to Dallas?
@BrazilPool2014 The Honduras Coach's Blazer with the big H is real sweet. Big Ed needs one

@CLawSoHard @Franko097 How appealing would Pelicans look right now w/ Davis, Nerlens, RAnder, Top 5 pick, no Jrue or Tyreke &amp; some space?!?
@Franko097 @CLawSoHard Wow Claw told me this the other day &amp; my 1st comment was 'Tyreke &amp; Gordon take up so much cap space though'. Dwade!

Doc's undefeated in Game 7s RT @richarddeitsch: Mike Emrick says he has broadcast 30 Game 7s during his career.
@ktaylor026 Ya I was kidding man. I hate the 'MJ wouldn't haves'
Agree w/ JVG on no free timeouts during review
MJ wouldn't have passed that to Bosh
This is unreal action
@CLawSoHard That's a bit of a stretch on Green's actions
@Frankussc Is intent in definition of a flagrant 1? I didn't think so. I thought Flag 1 for sure.
@CLawSoHard Great tweets
Huge @KDPomp sighting. #PompinAintEasyinMarketDistrict

@KingzKnows King, u Lawballin tonight?
@Franko097 @BradWright25 @PedroFavre I was done w/ Indiana though so the Matchups are just a personal preference. Hopin for good series
@Franko097 @BradWright25 @PedroFavre Spurs could lose again &amp; be similar but that Jazz team was boring &amp; felt like didn't stand a chance
@Franko097 @PedroFavre @BradWright25 Pretty sure he's pissed his boy Marty St Louis isn't involved
@Franko097 @BradWright25 Ya I'd be pessimistic, too. I dont even have any scientific theories other than I wont go against LeBron for now
@Franko097 I'll go Heat in 6. You?
@andrewperloff @dpshow Lance Steve might leave. DWest older. Thunder trio signed, younger &amp; better.
@KingzKnows LA Kingz goin all the way?!?
@KDPomp @donvito72 I bet Pomp plays some real sweet tunes in the bedroom. @lisapompeani. #PompsTunes
@donvito72 Cracks me up how absurd it is. I'll occasionally include his wife in the tweet too.
@KDPomp #PompsTunes
@KingzKnows @PedroFavre Wow u play KD-style D on him King?
@KingzKnows Dang King. You dominate?
@CLawSoHard @aoutrakis @Frankussc @Franko097 And overall, b4 side tracked, my point is he's about 15th statistically, is he top 5 reality?
@CLawSoHard @aoutrakis @Frankussc @Franko097 Those guys in running. I think Luol stinks. Johnson good but gimme Kawhi.
@aoutrakis @Frankussc @Franko097 @CLawSoHard I think Kawhi, Batum, Hayward are probably top guys that come to my mind. Others?
@Frankussc @aoutrakis @Franko097 @CLawSoHard Thats exact point/reason for question. Other than LBJ,KD,Melo,Jorge, would u want any other SF?
Is Kawhi the 5th best SF in the game? @aoutrakis @Frankussc @Franko097 @CLawSoHard
But man, there is a part of me that almost feels like we're robbed of LeBron Durant 7 game series while in primes.
Might even want spurs to win. Wouldn't mind either way really.
I wanted spurs. I like spurs better. Diaw is my boy. Dgreen is my boy. Pop is the best. Respect Duncan Parker Manu.
Heat Spurs is just as good as it gets. Gonna be huge.

@KingzKnows King, who u booking in OKC-SAS series?
@PedroFavre @Alfs11thFinger I gave Qualls a try. Could tell he was unhappy. Decided to buy him out out of respect for him to go back 'home'
@Frankussc It doesn't get any better than Pop
@Frankussc Brooks is turrible. I might fire him even if they won it all
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard I keep wondering who could kill the most flies in this series. Maybe Splitter
@KingzKnows @CLawSoHard Always envisioned Durant as a real brunch star
@cbillick @aoutrakis @ktaylor026 @Jason_J_W @Franko097 @PedroFavre Almost amazing nobody took Wilt for $3
@cbillick @aoutrakis @ktaylor026 Mailman mighta been my last choice
@JonBabs53 She thought she was boxing you out...
@JonBabs53 Haha, can't wait til she delivers a baby in 9 months
@aoutrakis Definitely surprised me. Wise to go with him
