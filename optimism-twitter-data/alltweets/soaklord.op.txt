@uncast @ransonbb bolts games are mostly San diegans spending money in San Diego. Hard to see it as new revenue.
@uncast @ransonbb still, it does make me sad. Sing it with me now, "Carson City Super Chargers!" <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@uncast @ransonbb as a fan I still can't justify it. LA means we no blackouts anymore. We see the best games. And we can still go to games.
@uncast @ransonbb $1.7b? That's gonna take a LOT of Superbowls to pay off. If a SB brings 250m to a city, we'll need 7. No ROI.
Nothing makes me feel more incompetent than trying to articulate my thoughts on paper.

@CassandraRules weird! I was uncomfortable in salinas Utah. Now I know why.

@RemarkableBird that moment when you no longer want to share a beverage...
@StephenKing @SugZierden I always use "happy to help" no problem devalues whatever you just did.

@Stepto thanks for the tip! #herorespondedtomytweet
@Stepto just played an hour after downloading. Not one stinking expansion map.

@rootikitty eccleston rocked. tennant was better, despite my biases. Smith, meh. I started watching baker in the early 80s so am skewed.
@rootikitty Jenna Coleman is a far more interesting companion in my mind. But to each their own.
@rootikitty you are required by the laws of physics to refer to your plane as a tardis at least once. You realize that, right?
Let me know if you have been displaced. I have some room. May not be comfortable as a hotel...

@rootikitty I can't even begin to tell you how jealous I am right now. Safe journeys.
@clownejd my buddies just sat in front of you on your trip to nc. Class act from all I hear. Much respect.
Suddenly feeling an urge to listen to bowie's dead man walking.
My new business venture--Amazombie Prime. Brains delivered to your door overnight.  Sorry, BRAAAAAAINZZZZ delivered to your door overnight.
@rootikitty dude! Is that the new amakitty prime delivery service?
@RemarkableBird only because you are disturbed by the idea of drinking a super sized one.
A little #fifthelement should go a long way towards cheering up.
San Diego's skyline really is stunning at times. 
@Stepto with you in the mix, it is an even match, right?
Is it wrong that there are people in my timeline that I am tempted to dm #got spoilers to? I could be Darth Spoiler.

Farts are the worm sign of the digestive tract.
@SugZierden if it is stupid then it is not worth getting worked up over. Be the duck. Let the stupidity flow off your back.
@uncastnet wow. Talk about zombie threads. What was that, like 2007?
@uncastnet about three years ago and absofuckinglutely. Thinking an urge run may be in our future.
@SugZierden tweet when you're pissed. Either pissed drink or pissed off it is cathartic. Unless you are pissed at me.

@RemarkableBird I see #Vans therefore I see no problem.
@paul_lander @rootikitty and the last thing I want is to look up and see that idiot hurtling towards me.
@paul_lander @rootikitty the question is whether or not they will recover the *white* box before the batteries run out... #racistsareidiots
@paul_lander @rootikitty hope he didn't run out of fuel! I hear that things fall out of the sky when that happens.
@wilw awesome, twitter, serious, and business all in the same tweet. Seems legit. Btw never follow me ever. Because reverse psych werks.
Thank you, Twitter for exposing me to how fvkstupid people can be. Did someone make too many VHS copy of a copy of copy copies of al bundy?
@zcobb the is a reason I don't watch television. No, I lied, there are MILLIONS of I reasons is don't watch television.
@JavierSeguraSr I swear it wasn't a commentary about work performance! Enjoy!
@BenKuchera interesting question. Would depend on the political and intellectual leanings of the reader. I invite you to weigh in on mine.
@rootikitty Bility? Umm thanks autocorrect. Not sure who Bility is... But
So much awesome in this pic. “@History_Pics: The rooftop test track on the Fiat factory in Turin, 1928. 
@RemarkableBird it's almost as awesome as being called Michael Bolton. #notalentassclown
@RemarkableBird you gotta admit, I'm a little bit rock n roll.
@rootikitty @RemarkableBird looked familiar. But I haven't been on a British beach in about 30 years.
@rootikitty @RemarkableBird never seen that on a SoCal beach. Actually had to look up common name for giant kelp &amp; feather boa. #marinenerd
@rootikitty @RemarkableBird she was referring to egregia menziesii not your more common macrocystis pyifera.
@rootikitty but I am more of a foam sweet foam guy most of the time. Occasionally I go decaf (house of shame)
@rootikitty I had that down as a hammerhead. Bility it works. One more than a shout at the double.

Gonna be all teh awesomez and like bang this homework out like a salvation army drum. (be sure to check back in 2 seconds for bored update)
That moment when you are on twitter, not your homework submission cite, sight, sight, the place where you put in the earl you wanna visit.
@RemarkableBird just think of how much a killjoy the intartubez would be for pedants if spell checked worked in context.
@truthknight News to whom exactly? Next, sun rises in East. Ursine mammals defecate in arboreal environs, religious pontiff wears pointy hat
@RemarkableBird Law blades are notoriously tough blades to mow. Mt Foldmore can be conquered. We didn't sacrifice enough virgin bloody marys

Despite all my prayers, the homework fairy has not magically finished my MBA class assignment. Curses! Foiled again.
An employee said to someone today that I was the best boss he's ever had. Made my day &amp; I need to tell my boss the same thing when I see him
@truthknight agreed. Wish I could have taken pics through the telescope.
Lunar eclipse looks way cool right now.
Wish I could figure out how to take pics with telescope. Moon is beautiful and lunar eclipse tonight.

@RemarkableBird @rootikitty  @truthknight I'm going to call my house cafe blue. You pick the shade... Sapphire, indigo, etc.
Just discovered the intersection tragedy and sacrilege. Made curry, forgot to get naan.
My lightbulb just burned out again. ♫
A bit of curry on a rainy day sounds about perfect. Curry is simmering rice is cooking. Wine is flowing.
@FacesPics this sidewalk box I found tonight is not so sure. 
@truthknight showing off? Nope. Hoping to get some weight off? Absolutely.
2nd five miler of the day.  I just ran 5.35 mi with Nike+. 
@rootikitty @BenKuchera sorry, wrong shade of blue.
@BenKuchera according to @rootikitty Sapphire restaurant for the best Indian food in the USA.
@RemarkableBird @rootikitty @truthknight OK, curry for dinner tomorrow night.
@rootikitty @truthknight you guys are making me seriously jealous and hungry. Going to have to make curry for dinner tonight.

@RemarkableBird I was totally listening when you were talking about that thing and stuff. Remember, I kept saying uh huh and yeah.
@marcoinsd pretty cool.
@rootikitty it's been about a decade. Yeah, the anaphylaxis symptoms kinda scared me off it. Might have been an additive.
@truthknight that's fantastic. Glad you like it.

@RemarkableBird @uncastnet to be fair, most of her disagreements are weak. But I do not judge.
@RemarkableBird @uncastnet @SugZierden ok apparently I need to work harder at getting @uncastnet followers. Hmm... Is @truthknight already?
@truthknight yessir. Thank you for thinking of me.
@truthknight in other words, thanks so much for sharing. All teh awesomez
@truthknight I had not. But watching it with @RemarkableBird brought a tear or two to her eye. We are going back this summer, and miss it.
My daughter just asked why the #chargers would choose to wait until next year to play again. Right?!? Right?!?
@SugZierden yeah but your hubby is all teh awesomes. I mean he picked you, right?
@jen_august My 3yo has eyelashes of a mascara model &amp; he regularly pulls off quotes like, "Daddy, I just love you enough". #Precious2Extreme
@SugZierden That's ok, I have two powers.  Irritation and #fountaingofuselessknowledge. So you are in good hands.
Sexual liberation isn't in any way related to gender. I am father to 1boy/1girl &amp; I wish them freedom &amp; choice.  They are 3 &amp; 6. #happyness
One of my followers has a picture of #bowie #alltehawesomes #notmanyfollowersbuttheyrock!
@jen_august Being sexually liberated means being comfortable with what you are doing and enjoying the moment. All else is repression.
@uncastnet @SugZierden @RemarkableBird Spelling has direction? Taking up left!  Because up is always good &amp; left is neither right nor wrong.
@SugZierden @uncastnet @RemarkableBird Guessing you had no desire to be rough &amp; scratchy and would rather be on course. #coarseversuscourse
@AnneWheaton my year is complete only a dozen days in! A Wheaton has responded to a tweet. #joygasm picture me with googly eyes.
@uncastnet follow this guy. He totally rules. And I will owe him lunch or something if you don't. @SugZierden and @RemarkableBird looking@u
Remember when we all thought Bluetooth headsets were cool? Me neither. #whyarepplstillwearingtheminpublic?
@uncastnet I could get you two followers!  Seriously!  Guaranteed by end of year!
@AnneWheaton and yet no reference to #chewn 
Rest in peace, Uncle David. You were a wonderful, admirable man and I couldn't have chosen a better best man. I'll miss you.
Ambient temp right now at poolside is 84. Thermodo verifies it's a hot January. I thought San Diego was in the northern hemisphere.
@GeekeryDo @BenKuchera that is my point. It is not random. She is taught consequences.
@GeekeryDo @BenKuchera technically Brave is also an exception.
@RemarkableBird @rootikitty that is a cause worth identity theft. All is forgiven.
“@RemarkableBird: @soaklord ummm .....    we need to talk <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>” d.a.m.m.i.t.
“ Neiman Marcus says hackers have stolen customers' credit-card information 
@truthknight @uncastnet yup. That is a truism. There is no better joy than seeing someone accomplish a dream. I LOVE announcing promotions.
@truthknight then again I felt that way when @uncastnet got his current gig and I had nothing to do with that either. I am weird that way.
@truthknight yaikno hence my joy. I had nothing to do with it and still felt some sense of accomplishment and joy when it happened.
@truthknight probably. Beautiful horn. Always wanted to eat you'd gotten one. Took more joy in your pilot's license.
@truthknight that was back in @ByReferralOnly days. You can play at our house any time. Hm... @truthknight @rootikitty duet? Need a singer.
@truthknight WoW! Was thinking yesterday about a picture you had of a platinum colored 1 on your phone. That 1 was $5k as I recall. And 5yo
@rootikitty @uncastnet @rootykitty Hey Lindsay, totally loved your version of The Parent Trap.  Everything went pear shaped from there.
Why did I come to twitter?  Sat down to do finance and HR homework. #internetisdistracting
@MissionFed I will say this: Your social team is sharp. You found my account/phone # and the person I spoke to today was attentive. kudos
@rootikitty @uncastnet @rootykitty it's ok. Meta stuff isn't an invasion of privacy. What could the &lt;redacted&gt; possibly discover from meta?
@zcobb @rootikitty @uncastnet I blame  clippers! Every time I go for a haircut those fvking clippers manage to create more grey clippings.
@rootikitty @uncastnet @rootykitty but but but obamacare. Is there a clause for hipster replacement? Perhaps weaning off pabst and a shave?
@rootikitty @uncastnet let's just be clear... @rootykitty is WAY too hip to be hipster.
@rootikitty challenge accepted.
@rootikitty of course I once wore "rental" bowling shoes I'd bought off the internet for at least two weeks at my last job.
@rootikitty is it wrong that I would so rock those?  Then again my feet are almost as fat as I am. I think you are hipstering CES.
Cerebro stimulatory haberdashery is the name of my new hipster band.
@RemarkableBird as long as it isn't Rat in the Kitchen. Though I'd prefer their remake of Can't Help Falling in Love.
@MissionFed me too. Current account is 8 yrs old. But I'm a customer since 1990. When I asked why I should stay with you rep had no answer.
@MissionFed I used to boast about your service. Lately your call center reps are all apologies and no action. Making me love @Simplify
If I had any artistic Bility whatsoever, "Wife Sleeping" would be my masterpiece.
@EasterbrookG TMQ states first road post season victory for Saints. Doesn't their Super Bowl win count? They were the "away" team.

@rootikitty failure is practice. Practice makes perfect. Ergo failure is a key component of perfection?
@rootikitty I have learned far more from failure than success. Failure is an excellent instructor.

@BestBuySupport exactly!  But they couldn't be bothered to check. That one store has angered me so much I've started buying elsewhere.
@BestBuySupport just attitude and poor service. Refused to allow an exchange w/o a receipt when they could have seen the purchase on rewards
@BestBuySupport as usual your Carmel Mountain Ranch store exemplifies horrible service. Thank you for the reminder in how not to act.
@BenKuchera With two kids I'm not optimistic about actually seeing midnight. Newyearsasparents

Me at breakfast. Habanero sauce on my eggs is a GREAT idea. Hmm.. Not as spicy as I was expecting. Me now: HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!
@zcobb watched the animated movie "The Illusionist" last night. Amazed at the lack of dialogue. Great, sad movie though. Wally also wins.
@uncastnet Chargers in the playoffs. Can you believe it?  Last four teams to beat philly in home opener won superbowl.  Chargers did this yr
@truthknight Ha!  I was wondering how long it would take for someone to comment on that. I'm using it before it's cool. #sohipster
Before you post something factual on &lt;insert social media here&gt; could you at least bing it to see if it has any basis in actual fact?
Love this greeting at work. 
@RemarkableBird to be clear, two of the kids may have four decades of kidxperience each to help with the fun. So proud of my gamer girl.

Must be Christmas. The crackers have popped. 
#xboxone HDMI pass through is fantastic. Very well implemented.
@XboxSupport2 I did take some steps. It appears to be working now. How long will you replace if issue returns?
@XboxSupport busted xbox one drive. Not the best of my Xmas surprises.
@RemarkableBird I totally had a positive k:d on that one. Santa has mad skillz yo.
Hoping the first present the little man gets is a fever free Xmas. Hate seeing him sick. He is SUCH a trooper.
Xbox 360 and ps3 obsolete in... About four to six hours as I reckon.

Ewan: coffee.

@rootikitty @jen_august I would pay to see this.   You know, to be hipster contrarian.  I totally paid to see this before it was cool.
@rootikitty Life without internet would be far less. *period*#period
@rootikitty @jen_august @original_m_e It was an amazing night all around.  I agree, she has the voice of an angel.
@rootikitty @jen_august @RemarkableBird I happen to agree, but I might be slightly biase #okreallyreallybiased.
@rootikitty @jen_august @RemarkableBird You honor me to tears.  Though I'd say you did well yourself.  Amazing woman that.
@jen_august @rootikitty @RemarkableBird Most amazing woman I have ever met.  She made the mistake of marrying me and I forgive it every day.
@rootikitty @jen_august The John Denver was pretty awesome too. First vinyl I owned. You were hitting all my buttons that night. #spiritual
@jen_august @rootikitty @RemarkableBird The only reason a copy exists.  I will not share outside of that.  Trust me, it was beautiful.
@jen_august @rootikitty No video, just audio. It was a spiritual moment.  shared to @RemarkableBird via Voxer because she couldn't be there.
@jen_august @rootikitty Won't forgive the guy who introduced me to that much awesome on a BASF all metal tape mix. Listened to it for hours.
@rootikitty @jen_august Nope.  You nailed the words.  #tearstotheeye and did a great job.  Heartfelt and soulful.  Memorable.
@rootikitty @jen_august With no talent, no ability to sing, I pull out Megadeth's rendition of Boots are Made for Walking...
@rootikitty @jen_august I actually have bootleg of him doing Hallelujah.  I'd share but then I'd be committed to a 187 to cover it all up.
@rootikitty @jen_august Yes, Ikno.  @rootikitty singing Dolly just might break the intartubez. too much awesome.
@rootikitty @jen_august Blues Brothers is exempt.  Because, well... Blues Brothers!!!!
I have issues.  Actually looked at my last tweet to see if it was APA compliant before realizing it's a tweet. #school
@rootikitty @jen_august I just don't think you understand. (It's ok, neither do I.) Two kinds of music I don't get... Country AND Western.
@Stepto Having just experienced ESET's headquarters party, agree with your sentiment, but the company is incorrect. ESET throws a party!
@rootikitty @jen_august Soo... not Miley or Billy Ray then? Achy Breaky + Twerking is... Yup, you're right.
@rootikitty @RemarkableBird BTW, Emma taught us a thing or two.  Didn't know they are the deepest diving of all penguins.  Over 500 ft.

@Upworthy If student loans were only guaranteed upon graduation, you'd see an entirely different approach to education.
@Upworthy @RBReich When student loans became guaranteed, colleges increased tuition. No public uni closed its doors due to lack of funding.

@BenKuchera Pay well for your area. We have many kids in our neighborhood with nannies. The cheap nanny kids suffer most in every case.
@BenKuchera How much are you willing to spend to make sure your children are raised as awesome as possible in your absence? Pay that amount.
Today will be awesome.  I've decided.  So let it be written, so let it be done. That is all.

@rootikitty Maybe I should start my own sect.  The church of Nom and the latter day meals.
@rootikitty Can I be responsible for one of the books?  Always thought there should have been a book of Don. And verily it came to be.
@rootikitty And so it came to pass that if the plate served is not full of nom, so shall ye pass. #churchofnom

@rootikitty it is tweet storms like these that make me realize just how lucky I am to work at ESET.

@marcoinsd What made you go to Android?  And which one?  Did you go Phablet with a Note 2 or HTC One or Galaxy 4?
@AnneWheaton It likely wasn't Yahoo!'s fault.  And I have recovered my account in the past, you should be able too, being all famous.

There is such a thing as a haggis/carnitas burrito. Don't know if my life can be complete without trying one.  Anyone know where to go?

@rootikitty seems to me you need to round out the shame by eating here. 
@dsantat I walked three in the rain this morning.  Does that make me seriously unbalanced? #probably.

So, just out of curiosity, who hit the sweaty/partially sweaty weather button in San Diego today?
@Pebble you said a month ago that switching to black (from a color) would get me shipping in two weeks. It hasn't. Update?
#thatawkwardmoment when you realize you ate a pork egg roll while waiting for your family to come home for dinner.
This! RT @bengoldacre: This elaborate prank on people who pirate games is sheer, unadulterated genius. 
Am I the only one that thinks of @SteveMartinToGo in the Jerk when I see Google Glass?
I'm pretty sure that the kids that scream non-stop at the pool probably aren't quiet anywhere else.
So if your job is to make video games, are you gamefully employed?

@rootikitty I give you @GreatDismal. Yes, Pattern Recognition was fantastic. Would love another Bigend story. Hint hint.
@rootikitty my favorite term for it. And one of the authors that has brought it up recently.
@rootikitty weird that you and 2 completely different writers I follow are all tweeting about this near simultaneously. Is jet lag trending?

Hey @marcoinsd I got Tommy in town. What bar you hanging in tonight?
I can't remember, which side of the plate does the salad spork go on?

1st real run in a long time. Felt good.  I just finished a 3.40 mi run with Nike+ Running. 
@uncastnet later, it'll be #fireinanotherhole
@rootikitty it's more an argument with my dress shirts and mirror than the scale honestly. But you're right, the workout felt awesome!
Walked five miles tonight after doing an hour of Ministry of Sound's Pump it Up aerobics video. Still terrified of my scale tomorrow.
Hoping the best for everyone in Boston right now.
Love days like this!

@rootikitty it gets better. Return after a couple of months, just for a peek and realize nothing has changed. You will be stuffed with meh.
@cinnamon_carter I read years ago that 1sq mile in London had over 1000 cameras.
Because I gotta admit, the ten miles I walked today had me feeling pretty old.
Ok swings, cartwheels, slide. What else to fully feel like a 40 yr old kid?
Did a cartwheel today for the first time in years. Felt like a kid.
Just walked by a car with no one near by and an open trunk with a case of quite good beer tempting me. #temptation
I'm asleep and @RemarkableBird has my phone

To be honest this was the first image I had when I heard pope Francis.
