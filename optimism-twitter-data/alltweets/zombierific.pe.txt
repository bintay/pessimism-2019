@birdjesusXL It's all work related. I'm doing a little better now!
I guess I'm doing two double shifts because I'm out of options.
I am going to lose my mind. How can it be possible to have no one who is willing to help?
@ShaneWatch I am still looking for that game. I've never played it. Was it fun?

Ugh she's cute and super expensive why am I broke right now #monsterhigh 
I MEAN LOOK HOW CUTE SHE IS. I just can't afford to pay like $200 for her. 
Still wish I could get my hands on the Comic Con "Webarella" doll. I asked like five people and no one could grab her. #monsterhigh
And I am going to need to buy the new Draculara doll once she's up on Amazon.
I've come to find that I may have another collecting problem and it's name is @MonsterHigh. The dolls are just SO CUTE.
Let’s go to #FrappuccinoHappyHour! 
I keep seeing @DC_Douglas's vines and I would really like to party with him omg.
@MasterCyclonis1 I have a go to person for LEDs if I get stuck I just need more time, haha.
@MasterCyclonis1 just a wee bit. now that we have a better idea we'll probably make our own next year. I'd like to rig the lighting better.
@MasterCyclonis1 Any time! Your wig is so spot on. Where do you plan to cosplay her?
@MasterCyclonis1 Any time! They're super easy to put together too.
@emedeme91 YOU SHOULD BE USED TO THIS NOW.
I just realised that I am super lost in Dragon Age still.... this is going to be exciting.
@emedeme91 I like your elf omg. I love all of your da characters so...that's at always going to be a thing.
@emedeme91 It's cause you're awesome. I like screamed when I saw the awesome art of your elf.
@emedeme91 I SHOULD WRITE SOMETHING TOO which means i should probably play more dragon age. omg.
@emedeme91 YOU SHALL BE SURPRISED THEN. Surprise birthday present. It will be exciting.
@emedeme91 but seriously. What do you want for your birthday. Otherwise I will surprise you with something from ACEN and you can't stop me.
@emedeme91 THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY DEAR. I love muffins. I need to get you something.
@emedeme91 isn't today your birthday because I need to clearly buy a cupcake to celebrate it.
@MasterCyclonis1 Also your Alex is AMAZING.
@MasterCyclonis1 Shapeways, actually! Here's the link. We'll probably remake them again next year. 
Playing @ElShaddaiGame again because I loved it and it's still absolutely gorgeous. Maybe I'll wear my el shaddai shirt today.
Someone CLEARLY has never done their research. I just...can't stop laughing.
FUCK BOY HADES oh fuck i am in tears i am laughing so hard. Why would you even. #greekmyth

Oh my goodness Kanji is going to be the death of me.
@rbm276 She's N4 level in terms of testing, and going for her N2. She's pretty fluent. It's nice when I want to practice.
EXCEPT I AM STUCK ON A KANJI AND I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. It's going to drive me crazy all night now.
Ahh yes. Listening to my fiancee help tutor people in Japanese again. It's exciting because I understand.
omg @Mechromancr you nerd
Ugh I want to cry over this and it's dumb. I should be able to handle this. I'll be okay I am just... not sure how to relax right now.
I don't even want to shoot things in Destiny omg. This is terrible. I'm so frustrated
Shit, I forgot my baby hunter has the BEST VOICE ON THE PLANET.
I am going to kill things in Destiny later I think to take my anger out.
Ah yes. Retail. Its amazing.
@fyouabstergo so much. Retail?
Wow. Just wow. Super angry and I'm just not happy. At least I'm off at one.
Woe today. Today is -great-
I'm always super nervous about cosplaying in general, but I always love cosplaying as Claire. Can't wait to get pictures of the final outfit
Claire Redfield cosplay! The original vest from 2012 versus the current one #residentevil #claireredfield 
IT GLOOOOOWS!!! @RE_Games its looking so good! #residentevil #cosplay 
@rbm276 just people. Sometimes you meet that person who claims they can do better at your job and I just smile and nod.
Ahh yes. Today is a great day. #not
Just found the #kpop station on SiriusXM radio. Amazing. #music
I am super amused. #music 
@unicronic ah you got me. Didn't realize Destiny was a global thing (she says with amuses sarcasm)
At least my coffee is right. I'll just let it roll off later.
Didn't have the breakfast sandwich I wanted after getting it wrong to begin with and charged me for the replacement one.
Huh. I'm actually a little angry at my @Starbucks today. They're usually so on point.
Win a Disney Infinity 3.0 Starter Pack from @InfinityInq! #DisneyInfinity 
Going to print this and put it on my wall. Now if @bungie read my writing I might immortalize that too. 
@Mechromancr THEY DID! I got super excited haha.
@Bungie ha! Apparently Bing wouldn't pull it up on my lame windows phone. Thank you!
Today consists of me wondering why @Bungie keeps streaming things while I'm at work... I want to see too!
@rbm276 I would rather not spoil someone else who hasn't seen the new movie, you know?
And twitter is like the worst possible place to discuss this on because Age of Ultron spoilers.
I have sudden MCU speculation things and I can't even right now.
@Mechromancr Seriously I saw a PC copy of Bee Movie the other day and I was like "no...."
@Mechromancr OH GOODNESS IT IS. I am dying.
@Mechromancr I CAN'T EVEN IS THAT A BEE MOVIE PEPE
We've decided to talk about how Strange is going to tie into the Infinity War. Mostly because I want to speculate over the other two gems.
Started Captain America Winter Soldier in the middle of the movie just for the Stephen Strange reference. @HollyConrad thought of you.
AH YES. Legally Blond is my favourtie movie. #movienight
@Mechromancr I might! I'm off 830pm est...hopefully.
@Mechromancr you're a doll. Maybe we can shoot things in that one salty game... Haha.
@Mechromancr I close tonight and open tomorrow because my entire schedule just got changed. Idefk what my days off are just yet.
@Mechromancr I'm stressed out in my job. I feel like everyone hates everyone and no one wants to help.
I hate my life today. I'm so stressed out and I'm just... Done. I'm done.
The saiyan prince won't let me drink coffee.... He's mistaken if he thinks he can stop me. #popfunko 
@OriginalFunko managed to get two I wanted on Star Wars day! Hope they make a BB1 and a Bulma in the future! 
You know she dead... (featuring Persephone and Choco) #pets 
Open pomegranates on my dashboard on tumblr and ALL I can think about is "seeds" and I'm out. I am about to fall into a fit of giggles. #why
I'm covered in super glue and paint. #cosplay
Screaming my jacket for #ACEN2015 looks amazing!! #Claireredfield #residentevil 
Ugh @OriginalFunko's Gamestop figures come out tomorrow. Going there asap. I must own #R2B1.
The trailer for the remake of Poltergeist keeps playing at gamestop and I'm like pls stop. #why
I'm feeling better. I was really bad yesterday. Glad sleep helped.
@emedeme91 WE ALL HAVE.
@emedeme91 RIGHT? Glad to hear they FINALLY have an idea when it's coming out.
@DCDeacon I enjoyed it! It's fun, and Hawkeye had some of the best lines.
Which if you're going to #ACEN2015 and need a photographer for your costumes, give me a shout out! My fiancee is offering her services.
Sick and watching the original Shall we Dance in Japanese while Crystal finishes up our cosplay for #ACEN2015
My feelings about Red Dwarf summed up in this. 
Red Dwarf is coming back. I am so excited. #teamsmeg
Today is going to be exciting. I don't feel well.
Just saw the Avengers movie!
Still on the look out for Little Mac cause like a moron I didn't buy him.
Yes. Yes I am. #amiibohunting
So am I really going to be stalking Best Buy to get my hands on a Silver Mario #amiibo?
@fyouabstergo I JUST lifted something wrpng
I just hurt myself. My back is killing me. Yay.
@Mechromancr this was me last night like who doesn't tag their spoilers!
@HollyConrad I can't wait! I dug out all my Doctor Strange comics in anticipation.
@HollyConrad GOOD. I can't wait to read all of those feelings as it gets closer.
@HollyConrad it's so true.he's just the best.
MIGHTY NO. 9 IS AT @GameStop I know what I am preordering tomorrow. Thank you @deepsilver and @MightyNo9
@Mechromancr Good for you! I'll be behind you all the way.
and omg what is with my typing tonight.
A Romeo and Juliet was worth the watch tonight.
@Mechromancr Any time! I cried reading your post. I am so happy that you are working towards accepting who you are.
@Mechromancr i've been so behind on tumblr posts, but I am so proud of you. Just so you know.
Cinema magic when Romeo hits Tybalt's car head on and screams at him. #movienight
I totally forgot about the 90's Romeo + Juliet. @LeoDiCaprio is super brilliant. Thank you for being great and making my night great.
@EvilosArt did 3.0 get announced?
@Playdor I know! Can't go wrong with that. They are actual Honda parts instead of after market too.
Before and after. I'm super happy! Almost done with this car stuff. 
Got my car back! It's gorgeous again. I'll post before and after photos soon.
I can't stop listening to this song. #music 
Hopefully tomorrow will be less eventful in the work place. Retail is certainly an exciting place.
Persephone's Emergency Surgery Fund | Pets &amp; Animals - YouCaring 
@rbm276 I think it was a failed attempt at flirting. Idk it was pretty gross.
Why would you say something like that? I'm like not okay with that. I could lose my job over that
Proceeded to back peddle and say he was joking when I told him it was inappropriate.
Today is awkward. Had a guy tell me that he would tell my manager I was looking at dirty pictures when I asked for his Id.
Wish I didn't feel like crying. Why is today going wrong?
Thank you so much for everyone who retweeted! The winner is @puglord!  Shoot me a DM with your information! 
Shulk winner will be announced soon! Sorry for the wait,  a lot has happened the last two days. Stay tuned! I'm going to eat dinner. #amiibo
@HteddyG No I haven't. Sorry it's been a busy day. I've barely just gotten home. I'm going to eat dinner first and then I'll announce it!
@emedeme91 I mean it! If you ever need anything let me know &lt;3.
@emedeme91 have I ever told you that you're a sweetheart and you're such a dear friend?
@birdjesusXL you're sweet! Thank you for keeping her in your thoughts. I cannot thank you enough.
@birdjesusXL she's healing wonderfully. I'm very happy with the progress. But now she has an ear infection.
Kitten has gross ears 8( poor thing. She's so not happy about that.
@fyouabstergo a little! She's curled up on herself right now. They just took her back.
I'm still stunned people donated anyway. Its a little bit but it helps so much. It relieved so much stress
Then again I don't really do anything but write and more people want art. So I suppose I'm happy not to be tumblr famous.
Wishing I was tumblr famous in some way so I'd have a little more help with my kitten. I'm really not looking forward to the vet bill.
@steviipop I appreciate it! I would be a little upset, I was there at 6am today, haha.
@steviipop ah! Well I've already put the money down. Guess I'm removing the image.
At the vet again to get the last staple out. She keeps staring at me. 
Getting a rental car. Yay!
@HteddyG I'll be announcing the Shulk winner later today! Something came up yesterday and I didn't do it then.
@AmiiboAlerts got mine today! Got there at like 6am. The guy before me was there at 2am!!

@Nintendobratkat mine hasn't handed out tickets yet. There's 11 people here and I'm expecting more.
@VietKnight second is not bad! I'm second too.
@VietKnight oh wow. You first at least?
@VietKnight there's eleven people now and someone is not getting one...
@pituvision mine isn't handing those out until like 15min til.

@TheKitsuneKami yes it is! I'm still giving away Shulk. It ends tomorrow. 
Ahh yes. Watching Dare Devil.
The @RE_Games box of AWESOME arrived. Why is the club only in Japan again...? #residentevil #バイオハザード 
Hahaha yep. Crying at work. Just what I wanted today.

@MrGjallarhorn legit I covered my mouth when that popped up on my screen and went "OH NO DON'T HATE ME"
@MrGjallarhorn I managed to get Hawkmoon after rolling through the nightfall with someone who was hoping to get it.
@MrGjallarhorn I love my warlock I just can't get all the raid armour. The RNG hates me with armour.
I mean look at this cute dear and now she's left me. #pets 
Our Kitten is laying on me. I am very honoured right now. She's never laid on me.
SCREAMING FINALLY WARLOCK ROBES CAN LOOK COOLER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. #destiny
@DestinyNews_net THAT HELMET.  The ram is super cool
@EllaEyre you look amazing!
@Mechromancr I will share play hawkmoon for you. I rather enjoy it.
Might be looking into a second job. Here goes nothing.
I need a hair cut like no ones business but this is the first time in weeks it looks great. #selfie 
Ahh yes. A Biohazard novel. I hope this isn't Chris' blood.... #residentevil #anovel #residenteviltotheliberty 
@ZyroXZ2 That's up to them at least! I just had an extra one laying around because I just wanted one to keep in the box.
@ZyroXZ2 My email blows up and I'm like "for a moment, people know I exist!" I just hope whoever wins loves it.
@ZyroXZ2 i'm running my first twitter giveaway, it's kind of fun seeing the retweets, haha.
She's super precious. Saturday we should be getting the staples removed. #persephonethekitten 
At least the kitten is up and walking around more! I am just... so grateful for everyone who is sharing our fundraiser.
Shulk is going to be grateful to go to a new home. 
@pituvision oh gosh i am sorry for your loss.
@EvilosArt I saw this while I was at work! Thank you so much, I nearly screamed, haha.
Don't forget that I'm doing an #amiibo giveaway! 
Give me Toland too. He can't be dead yet.... #Destiny

@Mechromancr ugh I want those so bad. Omg.
Avela is going to annoy the hell out of him in sure. Damnit I might start writing again. #destiny
Shit if that's Osiris I'm gonna scream. His work with the Hive is legendary. I wonder what he knows about the Vex. #Destiny
I don't want to be at work today. I'm not doing okay.
The face of someone who wishes she could get her hair done. Going to go Claire Redfield red next. 
@Mechromancr kitties! Before the cone. 
Ugh I need an @EvilosArt custom #amiibo like.... sometime in the future. Once the kitten bill is down I will so look into it.
@EvilosArt gosh your custom work is amazing. One day I will own something of yours. This is just gorgeous.
@EAStarWars @noelblood @dj_leubner Congratulations to winners! Super jealous but I am sure they will love it!
@EvilosArt Looking forward to it!
Just started watching Daredevil.
Especially trying to figure out how I am going to pay off the bill otherwise and budgeting. I'm really bad at that.
I am really so grateful to anyone who is spreading the word about my kitten. It's been exciting.
WHY CAN'T I HUG PEOPLE THROUGH THE INTERNET. My dear friend in Florida just donated to help our kitten. Going to cry.

eBay で日本の３dsを売ります！見て下さい、お願いします。
In the mean time! Selling my Japanese 3DS on ebay. Give it a look at! 
@fyouabstergo She went to her food bowl, and then started looking in boxes for her . My cat is so confused.
My cat is wondering where the kitten is. Persephone is over night in post op care and my old kitty is looking for her right now.
@emedeme91 
@emedeme91 there is! I'll tweet you a link!
@emedeme91 you're amazing. I cannot even begin to thank you enough. I'm going to cry and write things for you.
I'll be doing an #amiibo giveaway tomorrow to help with my kitten.  Spread the word, #Shulk is getting a new home. 
Kitty is gearing up for a night of post op care. 
Hey @Amiibonews any chance you can help me out?
Actually, scratch that. I would be happy to do an #amiibo giveaway to try and raise some money for my kitten. 

to everyone who does.
If any of my followers have been keeping up, we are taking donations to cover vet fees. I will probably be writing thank you cards
I'll be paying for her surgery now, and then waiting to hear back about an over night thing.
I'll be updating about information about our kitten throughout the night. I'm going to be heading to the vets in about an hour.
If someone donates a dollar I will seriously cry. I'll had write thank you cards if that's what it takes.
I hate asking for money. I do. The vet bill is just daunting and it'll be on my card today. I just want her to be okay.
Wishing I could draw to take emergency commissions. I wonder if I could offer some writing. Idk who'd pay me to write.
Freaking out a little bit about the kitten. I'm more worried about the money. Might look into some options. I just want her to be okay.
@DinoVideo I hope so too. Thank you so much.
Her name is Persephone, and she's the sweetest. She finally got my old cat, Choco, to play. 
Our kitten needs surgery and its going to be an exciting day. 8( please keep her in your thoughts today. 
Date night with the fiancée. Fried cheese cubes!! #datenight

Why am I playing Destiny rn. I could be playing so many other games.
@AyeItsPetrovic omg when you get on run the nightfall with me and then help my hunter OFF THE MOON. omg i hate the moon.
I am so tired of the moon. I can't play the moon by myself least I get sick. This is terrible. Hopefully @AyeItsPetrovic will help me out.
Ugh I just realised I don't want to do this by myself. I just want to be level 20 already so I don't have to do this stuff.
@petermooreEA THAT PATCH. That's super swanky.
Ugh I forgot how low level my hunter is. This is awful.
逆転裁判テーマはかわいいですよ！#逆転裁判 #new3ds 
I am so happy with the new Star Wars trailer. I am hyped. So much Star Wars news! #StarWarsCelebration
Ahh yes. Getting my ass kicked. This seems right.
I USED TO BE SO MUCH BETTER AT THIS. Okay. Round 2. Let's do this Nightfall.
Well that didn't end well. #Destiny
I am SUPER rusty with this game. Running the Nightfall by myself. #destiny 
Gosh I'm going to be rusty. I hope this doesn't end badly.
Staring at the nightfall like do i want to do this with people i don't know... #destiny
@regaliis Plus Queen of the Reef can call me for favours any time.
@regaliis Me too. I love the Awoken. They're so interesting!
@regaliis I am super excited for House of Wolves...I just hope there are actual story missions you know?
I haven't played #destiny in a long time so... I think I might give it a go today and then finally start Final Fantasy Type 0.
I miss writing. I'm looking forward to going back to Destiny to try and get some inspiration again.
Today is an interesting day.
@fyouabstergo check the retweet!
Rocking a Mortal Kombat temp tattoo though. It amuses me greatly. #MortalKombat @noobde love the game! 
Omg guitar hero is coming back. I don't know how I feel about this. #gaming
@Mechromancr OH MY.
All right. Going to play the first episode after work tomorrow #LifeIsStrange 
@Mechromancr what's going on?
So one of my coworkers bought me a psn card to get Life is Strange.
I'm going back to Destiny.


Midnight tonight and I'm slightly worried for it. Not because of the game but because I'm still dizzy. How exciting.
@AmiiboNews Yes Asia has preorders up. 
THANKS TWITTER FOR MAKING ME SAD I'M NOT AT COACHELLA. I would have killed to see @GlassAnimals yesterday.
Oh yay this is exciting. I am really dizzy.
I'm really not feeling today. J just want to curl up and write.
@AyeItsPetrovic you can have my bacon next time. Some how I'll send it to Texas!
@Mechromancr I'm really glad! &lt;3
@Mechromancr you deserve to be happy with yourself.
@Mechromancr ohh well then go be gorgeous &lt;3 i totally understand!
@Mechromancr why! The beard is gorgeous. You're gorgeous.
I want to write but idk what about. #writerproblems
Miss the days when it would just walk me through my problem over the phone so I can do it myself in the future.
Hopefully getting my food fixed at Starbucks they put bacon on my breakfast sandwich. 8(
Easy A is probably my favourite movie of all time. #movie
@GlassAnimals Crowd looks amazing! Wish I was there no lie.
I forgot I have to work tomorrow so I should probably stop drinking.
@Mechromancr Tell me about it. I am like "BUT. DOES THIS SOUND OKAY?"
IT BEGINS #letitgo 
Frozen sing-a-long night with my fav people. #loveisanopendoor. 
Gonna die.
LIKE I AM SO SMART. I DON'T EAT MEAT FOR HEALTH REASONS. I'm gonna die. #dramatic
OH NO WHAT HAVE I DONE. I forgot my roommate was making real burgers and I checked my fiancées AND THEN LICKED MY FINGER.
@Mechromancr rip indeed omg. I'm gonna die without flawless hair. AND WITH WRITERS BLOCK what a terrible way to go.
@Mechromancr YOU'RE NOT BUT YOU'RE SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN I AM. Also your new hair cut is SO on point.
Started #Xenobladechronicles. I'm really happy with it do far but... I need to test it with my Shulk #amiibo 
Omg I just realized I'm older then @Mechromancr how did this happen?!
I'm going to start Final Fantasy Type 0 soon. It'll be nice to play it on a bigger screen than my psp!
SOON. #new3ds #coverplates #gaming 
That moment when you order something from Madrid on ebay and remember that Europe got the cover plates and I know people in Europe...#why
@madphilb I AM SUPER EXCITED.
Thinking about getting a capture card for the 3ds. Is it worth it? #gaming
Picking up Xenoblade Chronicles today! Finally going to play it and I can't wait. #gaming
Starting the day off right with coffee and music.
Listening to @Hozier's Like Real People Do and I just am absolutely in love again. Wish I could see you in concert! #music
@pituvision I'm pretty sure that it's not real. I can't seem to find anything about it on the Japanese sites.
@EvilosArt Gosh it's so gorgeous. I love it.
@pituvision I don't know how that would have happened. Gamestop is supposed to check IDs with web cancels like that.
@TheSeti12345 Rosetta Stone is a $300-$400 software program when I've already taken school on it for six years. The 3Ds was cheaper.
@TheSeti12345 I speak Japanese. I wanted to practice so I imported the Japanese one because all of the games are region locked.
@TheSeti12345 Buy a new one then? You'd be able to buy games in your country. I imported the system from Japan. It's region locked.
@TheSeti12345 I don't know if I could budge much on the price. I imported it, plus I'm including a bigger memory card that it came with.
@ghostgreeen nope. tumblr loves damning thing first, and then asking questions later.
@AmiiboNews @amazongames this is totally my new favourite thing.
@Pokentomologist It is super nice to see! I am really grateful that a lot of people are getting together to try and help each other out too.
Goodness there's a ton of #amiibo giveaways right now. I'm actually pretty impressed.
Oh no there goes my heart again. Thanks Passenger. When did Let Her Go end up on my ipod. #music
@emilieautumn gosh your hand writing. I teared up a bit seeing this. Thank you for showing us &lt;3
Standard Japanese 3ds. It would come with original box, charger and a 4gb SD card. 
@rbm276 I'll take some pictures of it. It will also come with a 4gb SD card.
@rbm276 I paid about $250 when I first got it, i'm hoping to get $150, but I'm going to see if there's a game I'll toss in with it.
I'm also planning on selling my standard Japanese 3ds. Would anyone be interested? #Nintendo #3ds
I'm going to write for a bit, then I'll start on ラビリンスの彼方. #gaming
I am so excited omg. The seller is letting me go with my original offer seeing as I can't get it any cheaper. Pictures to come!
Yes!! I'm getting my xenoblade coverplates for my 3ds!!
@pituvision you've got me out looking for them now do I'd be happy to help.
@pituvision well if you need any help grabbing one on launch let me know! I'll be at target.
@pituvision why would someone do that though? That's ridiculous.
And the Honda place doesn't have a body shop. So idek what I am supposed to do now.
I just want this car thing to be over with. First the insurance says I can get Honda parts, now my car is too old...
Well today is exciting. So I'm going to be cute and hope this means my day goes better. 
@AmiiboAlerts this is the most amazing fake chat I've ever seen.
@JoshSuperlink  Link is actually on amazon right now for $40!  Samus for $47, so better chances.
@JoshSuperlink I've checked ebay, amazon, and play-asia. I've seen both of them for upwards of $200 each. It's awful.
@JoshSuperlink I've been trying to track them both down and I just can't spend $130 on each of them right now.  I am glad you got one!
@JoshSuperlink Is that the pittoo figma figure? omg i am a little jealous!
@AmiiboNews amazing he even came back in stock! That's exciting.
I just realised Stella Glow is coming out in June. I guess I am going to import that one too. I hope they find Mikage-san though. #gaming
omg @emedeme91  the oc meme took me years, but it's up now.
@AmiiboNews 
@pituvision Are other people experiencing it? I'm like checking my email like a crazy person now.
Omg @emedeme91 making me think about things cause the oc meme is fab. ;; thanks so much this is helping a lot.
@pituvision WHAT no! I've been dreading that all day, no lie.
@emedeme91 Awesome! Figured it didn't hurt to check just in case. &lt;3
@emedeme91 ...want me to remove your name from the twitter when i screen cap?
@emedeme91 omg eme you're the best i am TOTALLY going to screen cap it.
Okay. Writing is going to happen tonight. I just need to figure out what I want to write about. Maybe stare at that oc meme or something.
@emedeme91 Awesome! You're the best. It just dawned on me that I'm in Ohio now. Pretty sure my grandmother would be super confused.
@emedeme91 OMG, Yes. I will do that. Want me to just dm it to you on twitter?
@emedeme91 THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR MOVING.
@emedeme91 WELL UM.  I ordered the set for myself and someone, and so when book two goes out it's heading to Florida. oops.
Oh. I just realised my 100 Days of Night stuff is going to be sent to Florida..
My fiancee is making my ring tone "Drive My Van into Your Heart" from Steven Universe....thanks love. Thank you.
My #new3ds is super naked without it. I'm super smart. #amiibohunting #poornaked3ds 
So with buying the #jigglypuff #amiibo I now have a slight problem. How am I going to accept the offer for the #Xenoblade cover plates...
@lootcrate Slytherin!
My next PSN purchase is so @SupergiantGames's #Bastion. If you haven't play it, go do so!
Everyone who texts me now has their own #Transistor tone. Perfect
I have this urge to sing Once On this Island all the way to work today but ...I don't have the cd any more. #musicalproblems
Ohh just got an email for ESO. Do I end up going back for the weekend or just waiting until June...
I think I've become an #amiibohunter. This is my new life.
@Pokentomologist I am a HUGE Kid Icarus fan. I was originally going to paint my second Pit because I forgot they were releasing Dark Pit.
@Pokentomologist I was pretty upset! She was the only one I really wanted out of that wave. I am super glad I got her in the end.
@Pokentomologist Probably the best way to go! I am hording a few extra in case I miss Dark Pit and Palutena.
@Pokentomologist Then another woman walked in and claimed she had one held and they sold it to her. I just was glad someone had one to trade
@Pokentomologist I had an employee hold one for me out of kindness because I was at work, and someone else had given me wrong info.
@Pokentomologist I didn't even get Rosalina from Target. I ended up trading someone Pit for her.
@Pokentomologist At the very least I'd attempt to get up early to hit Target before the scalpers.
@Pokentomologist @AmiiboTweets I just happened to be home when it went up.
@AmiiboTweets I get them sent to my phone now so I don't miss anything again.
@pituvision YAY I am glad you got Jigglypuff too!
@daerapraxidice @fyouabstergo @Target More like this? 
@fyouabstergo I DO DON'T I.
I am going to camp out for  #amiibohunting at @ToysRUs. This is now become an exciting adventure.
So I am making plans with a friend to camp out for Greninja. I am super excited.
Jigglypuff will no longer haunt my soul. Thank you @Target for putting it back up on your site! I am so happy now.
SCREAMING Thank you @AmiiboNews I just got Jigglypuff! I am so happy now.
TRANSISTOR RING TONES. ON MY PHONE. Making my day, @SupergiantGames thanks for putting those up.
Okay writing. OKAY WRITING. LET'S DO THIS. I'm going to write!
Also I just finished steven universe and now I can't get up off the floor.
@emedeme91 IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. Those pictures. My heart.
I HAVE SUDDEN INTENSE GREEK MYTH FEELINGS, and not because I am going to reread the Iliad again. #curseyoueme @emedeme91
I am actually surprised Yokai Watch is trending in the states right now.
And tracking won't update. I'm just going to hope it arrives in once piece. I really would like to read The Secret History again.
I AM SO WORRIED ABOUT MY BOOK. Like it went from UPS to the post office, and it was supposed to be here yesterday....
SO MUCH FOR VIDEO GAMES. Watching bob's burgers for the billionth time. EXCEPT IT'S SEASON 4 FINALLY ON NETFLIX.
One day I will own one of @EvilosArt's amazing Amiibo customs.
@EvilosArt Oh gosh that is absolutely gorgeous!
@madphilb That I can do!
@AmiiboAlerts Kind of wish they were actual figures but they're super cute otherwise!
Ugh. I am reading over the small thing I wrote last night and I'm like "but why".
@fyouabstergo True but I also have like.. The Wolf Amonger Us and Final Fantasy Type 0 that I've never opened.
@Mechromancr I tossed it in as a last resort. I'm going through my games right now to see what else I should play.
I AM ONLINE ON THE PS4 and I don't know what to play.
@WildLilFlower IT WILL BE INTENSE (like camping)
@WildLilFlower There will be more April 27th. I hope you're not getting notifications from me. I'll be live tweeting from toys r us at 2am.
@WildLilFlower OH COME ON THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
@rbm276 I think so! I read the Odyssey and the Iliad like every year and might as well when I'm #amiibohunting cause it's ruining my life.
@rbm276 I am going to be giggling over this for the next like billion years. Going to bring the Odyssey with me to @ToysRUs on the 27th.
I am going to make real terrible Odyssey jokes at work Wednesday to keep me sane if I pull a double. I mean Nobody cares right?
useless brain. I just want to write! Can you please let me do so? #writersblock
I am obsessed with this stupid Poketoru game.. what has my life become?! #nintendo
@AmiiboTweets I appreciate it! I cried tears of joy when I could get people's orders to go through. Seriously.
@AmiiboTweets I've been slayed. Gives me something to laugh about after that nightmare.
@AmiiboTweets that shirt is hilarious omg
@WesPhillips I'm still a little confused by Ello.
@TheSeti12345 Personally I like the games on the 3DS a little better, but the Vita also has a lot of PS1 classics that I enjoy. Tough choice
@TheSeti12345 Only be compatible with the New Nintendo 3DS so it's entirely up to you!
@TheSeti12345 The 3DS however, would boil down to whether or not you want the new one or not. A lot of the games in the future will-
@TheSeti12345 Oh goodness! Well the only Vita that I know of that's around is the 2000 model, which is super lightweight.
Why is today so miserable? Ugh it's awful. I keep coloring index cards because I'm hitting a huge writers block.
@rbm276 I can't eat meat so I'm a little stuck.
Ahh yes. The only thing I can eat at Wendy's now. French Fries. My one true love.
@daerapraxidice @fyouabstergo @emedeme91 challenge accepted.
@emedeme91 lol true that. Keep rocking that teal. It's super adorable on you. &lt;3
I'm on a pink thing lately. It's really weird because most of my clothing is dark or black.
@emedeme91 I'm hella jealous. I want cotton candy pink hair but I can't due to my job. 8(
@fyouabstergo just trying to scramble to get things done.
@emedeme91 I can't respond on tumblr BUT YOUR HAIR IS SUPER CUTE.
I've been reminded why I want to quit my job. It's terrible.
When will my life begin? #tangledmusicalnumber @ today

Ah yes. Monday. Not ready for today.
@AmiiboNews @AmiiboInq here's hoping! I'm going to be there super early,
@Chupacaubrey This sounds amazing.
What a day to be alive. I can now cite tweets in MLA formatting. Amazing. #education
Ngel, glad I am getting notifs to my phone from @Lavellann and @alyloki because the conversations are fab.
@Lavellann right? Though to be fair I forgot it was Easter til people kept calling and asking if I was open.
Idgi. If you didn't have time to come into my store, why did you stop? Why yell at me over it?
I'm realizing I should have packed food cause I'm in pain and my medication requires food.
Its so nice out and I'm at work. I kind of wish I could picnic.
@daerapraxidice IT'S THE BEST IDEA
@daerapraxidice yes. Perfect. Brb dressing up as Odysseus
I suppose that means I'll have to fight a war in Troy first. Oops.
Things I want for silly reasons. The Honda Odyssey van... So I can have my own adventure to get back to my wife. #nobodyjokeanyone
@TheSeti12345 Possibly! Who knows! I just wish I didn't have to import the cover plates.
@TheSeti12345 My Japanese one was $150, and my America 3DS XL was $200.
@TheSeti12345 American's like the larger model more. That seems to be the common consensus.
@TheSeti12345 America didn't get the smaller New 3DS at all so unfortunately I have to import them.
If anyone has suggestions on how to get the @XenobladeJP cover plate for it without having to pay fifty dollars please let me know. #gaming
Also, my face. Enjoy that twitter. #nintendo #new3ds
The New Nintendo 3DS from Japan I got, except it's super naked. I am in love with how the cover plates snap on! 
@rbm276 The life of retail, I'm afraid.
@rbm276 just long and awful. Technology making people upset because I can't process credit cards at all and they're not happy.
Well actually a little bit better. I live with great people.
Today was awful. ...but I am doing a bit better. I think.
@Lavellann right? Might as well be hella cute and fashionable in a preventative way!
@Lavellann legit me this morning too omg
My manager bought this for me yesterday and I feel like there's a joke here. 
NEW 3DS IS SUPER CUTE AND AWESOME and i love it omg.
@AmiiboNews please be me. I reblogged the all mighty bagel. I need something good today (congrats who wins if it's not me)
@Aquaria777 @AmiiboNews I eel everything about #amiibos right now.
@SupergiantGames oh no I work Monday! I hope I can get one.
PIKMIN!!!!!!! They're so cute omg. Yes please carry my data. 
I keep bouncing in my chair and the kitten high fived me with her mouth. Kitten why...
IT BEGINS. system update THEN DATA TRANSFER!! 
Or maybe not. This amiibo thing is going to be the death of me #amiibohunting
@AmiiboNews may have just snagged one! PayPal may have gone through on our end!
@ShaneWatch oh no! I am importing Stella Glow too... I hope he's okay.

Next step: Get final fantasy explorers. I'm on a hand held gaming kick recently.
Ready to transfer my new 3ds stuff! I am super excited!
So the constant aching pain is amazing but i am tired of the chiropractor calls going "YOU NEED US PLEASE SEE US".
SO WHATEVER #AMIIBO I am going to shower and get my 3dsgb micro sd card and start transferring my Japanese 3ds stuff.
@AmiiboNews OH GOODNESS I AM IN TEARS I AM LAUGHING SO HARD. If eel you.
Judgmental Staring Jigglypuff is now my new twitter header. #amiibo #jigglypuff
@Starbucks I hope you have my back when I wake up super early to go to @ToysRUs and @Target to go #amiibohunting 5/29 
@AmiiboNews @AmiiboInq That's a super accurate gif. 
@ToysRUs's website right now and I'm just like. "Why was it 3am. Why not 5am. I was up at five"  #kindlyretry #amiibo 
@Lavellann Seriously Jigglypuff's judgmental face is haunting my dreams.
@Lavellann Thankfully the guy who hit me admitted fault so his insurance is taking care of it.
@Lavellann I'm totally okay, just in pain lately but that's about it. Except stupid amiibos might kill me.
@Lavellann MONDAY omg I think I have a picture of my car. 
@Lavellann ADULT STUFF. Like dealing with fifty billion calls about my car accident. I DON'T CARE GO AWAY OMG.
I haven't played video games in like years. I should get back into that.
I am having flash backs to yesterday trying to get Jigglypuff. If Greninja doesn't go back up by 9am...retry #amiibo 
@daerapraxidice @ToysRUs 
@pituvision Ugh it's terrible. I hope you managed to get some of Wave 4.
Tempted to start an #amiibo support group for those of us who really want them but have had no luck.
@pituvision @ToysRUs They went on briefly at around 830am but no one could add it to the cart. Might be coming back online but who knows.
@AmiiboNews We had them in our cart when things went down. We only managed to get Charizard but we're still trying.
@AmiiboNews They sold out in 30 seconds dude. 8(
@AmiiboNews IT WON'T ADD TO CART.
Ugh really disappointed with @ToysRUs putting the amiibos up at 3am. I got up at 5am to try for them and already gone. #amiibo
@AmiiboNews that's super ridiculous of @ToysRUs. I'm really nor happy with how this wave is going already.
So, how did everyone survive the #amiibopocalypse? Anyone get any of the #amiibos?
あああ！やった！My New Nintendo 3DS came in! @Nintendo I am so excited!きせかえプレートはすごいですよ！ 
@kpb1370 it'll be fine! I'll try and get one on release day. I'm glad you got one at least!
@AmiiboNews I called them earlier today and they told me they weren't doing in store preorders.
@kpb1370 I didn't. I've been up since 7am refreshing the site. Guess I'm waking up super early to go to the store on release.
@pituvision I've been up since seven am trying to get one.. I kept getting an error processing my request. 8( Super disappointed right now.
@AmiiboNews disappointed with @Target's site barely working for it. I was looking forward to Jigglypuff.
Might have to get the 29th of May off to hang out at a @Target to pick up #jigglypuff.
@AskTarget So I kept getting the retry error and now the amiibo are sold out? Am I out of luck?
@kpb1370 @AmiiboNews It keeps giving me an error. 8(
@AmiiboNews But does the preorder button actually work?!
@fyouabstergo Anything for you Cat! The #Jigglypuffsaga is now it's new name
@_anthonynash Why thank you!
I think the Jigglypuff image is going to be my new reaction image. #Amiibo 
@fyouabstergo IT WON'T LET ME CAT
Please Kindly Retry #amiibo #jigglypuff 
@_anthonynash lol I'll be at work trying for them too. That will be fun!
@_anthonynash TELL ME ABOUT IT. I'm like "Please target. Please love me. Give to me the thing."
it's like it's mocking me... 
Why goodness why. #Amiibo 
Has anyone gotten through the checkout screen for the #jigglypuffamiibo #amiibo?
@AskTarget Hey the preorder button is back up but it's not loading into my cart for the Jigglypuff amiibo. should I keep refreshing?
@AmiiboNews my screen right now is driving me crazy cause there's an error. 
OH NO ARE YOU PLAYING MIND GAMES? Preorder button showed up on my browser...and then disappeared #amiibo #jigglypuff
Get's a @Target email and I got super excited for a moment, haha. Wow I'm so lame. #amiibo It was just about creating my account online.
Also thanks for responding @AskTarget about the amiibo! I really do appreciate it. &lt;3
At least it's exciting! Hopefully @GameStop's site will be just as exciting later today.
Constantly refreshing @Target's site for Jigglypuff is not quite how I expected to start my day. #Amiibo #jigglypuff
@AskTarget thanks! I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm super excited. I missed out on Rosalina earlier this year cause I wasn't fast enough.
@joshrichards305 I'm super hopeful of that. I'm hoping I can go in store though. This prepurchase thing is frustrating.
@joshrichards305 with Gamestop announcing a 2pm central time do you think the others will follow?
Why must you mock me with Jigglypuff, @target? I just want to buy one. #amiibo
@AmiiboNews is that why it keeps giving the error? Do we know when it goes live?
New Japanese 3DS is in Kentucky! So close to being in Ohio... hurry up I want to see you up close. #Nintendo
Though I suppose it's not a bad thing that the e-capcom store only ships to Japan. The things I would buy.
curse you, e-capcom store for only shipping to Japan....
Why Play-Asia?! I just wanted the really big awesome collectors edition from the e-capcom store for 大逆転裁判 @Capcom_Unity please help
@AmiiboNews Guess that Best Buy might get Jigglypuff?
@trintran They are super cute! I'm planning on preordering them tomorrow if they're up. I can't wait to play Splatoon.
Crap Crap crap, 大逆転裁判 ‐成歩堂龍ノ介の冒険 has a collectors edition and I want it super bad. @Capcom_Unity why?!
In the car #UptownFunk comes on. @fyouabstergo sings "Girls hit your Waluiigi" and I nearly drowned in my tea. #Nintendo
@madphilb Naw unfortunately.
@AmiiboNews Dark Pit will be mine.
#smashdads I'm ready.
PETITION FOR @NintendoAmerica TO MAKE AN @octodadgame #AMIIBO? I think this needs to happen.
I really wish I could get my hands on the @XenobladeJP cover plate for my Japanese New 3ds. 8( Fifty dollars is a lot.
YES YES YES. @XenobladeJP
YES YES YES DAIGYAKUTEN SAIBAN HAS A DAAAATE. #gonnaubyit
#Amiibo's are ruining my life.
MAAAAAAAAY
I SEE YOU MARTH #AMIIBO. WHEN ARE YOU COMING?
crying the attack on titan game I imported is coming to the states. Amazing.
BECAUSE BRAVELY SECOND END LAYER RELEASE DATE, SCREAMING. #NintendoDirect
I can't watch the Japanese direct and the American Direct at the same time. This is a travesty. #NintendoDirect
@octodadgame @sgoast PLEASE YES.
@LadieAuPair WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. I am going to cry.
BRING FATAL FRAME 4 TO THE WIIU ESHOP?! @NintendoAmerica
Screaming I am super happy. I am crying. I've been waiting for Fatal Frame for so long.
FATAL FRAME. YES. FINALLY.
@AtlusUSA ahhh I am SO looking forward to Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem! Finally!
Oh WOW Don't Starve too? Nice @NintendoAmerica
Screaming #amiibo is going to ruin my life!
YES YES YES. @YoungHorses @octodadgame COMING TO THE WIIU.
@AmiiboNews Looking forward to it!
So #NintendoDirect, homework and then #StevenUniverse. That's a super awesome plan for the day.
And #Amiibo. I really have been waiting to hear more about what games will use them.  (like give me a re-release date for Marth please.)
#NintendoDirect is in 15 minutes! I am super excited to see what they announce. Maybe @SquareEnixUSA's Final Fantasy Explorers?
Especially with you calling me at SEVEN IN THE MORNING. I was asleep. I wanted to sleep in. Thank you very much.
I'm so tired of phone calls about my car accident. Please stop calling me. Forty calls is too much.
I keep staring at my amazon cart going "when am I going to buy @smallpools new vinyl..." It's so great and I need it.
I can't wait to play @SupergiantGames's Bastion again. Such a good game.
@TheSeti12345 yes but there will be games that are only compatible with the new 3ds functions.
@TheSeti12345 It can play the DS and 3DS games, that's what I meant.
@TheSeti12345 with the new 3ds being completely backwards with Ds and regular 3ds games, I'd probably get the new one.
@Lavellann I just got curious cause like why would you even and then their blog is just... wow.
@madphilb I am! My back hurts though so that's exciting. I am going to see a doctor later today from it. 8(
I MADE A MISTAKE. @Lavellann that person is totally out in left field with their "help." I got lost in her blog and my eyes glazed over.
My cat and my room mate's cat are either playing or fighting through the door... I'm still not sure of which.
@PTibz yes. it sounds super delicious too.
My cat isn't helping me. I look super graceful. 
Waking up and my back is killing me. I'm going to have to go see a doctor. I'm not looking forward to that.
Oh damn reblogged that meme instead of posting it. Sorry @emedeme91 I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing.
@DaftLegends @EvilosArt Ahhh that's so great!!
HELL YEAH I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT THIS EVENING. My life is now exciting. I'm okay, I promise.
I need to write something new for the Destiny blog.

#TOGETHER <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
@Lavellann ahhh. 8( curse you new York!
@Lavellann local like by you?
@Lavellann omg I've never seen it before. I'm SO ordering it when I get a chance.
@Lavellann OMG I need those.
@Lavellann and eggs. And milk. I'm pescatarian 8(
@Lavellann I'm sorry I love peeps too much to be super vegan.
@Lavellann oh no I've been caught!
OR I CAN MAKE A PEEP CAKE. probably not vegan but the vegan police aren't watching.
I was denied PEEP CUPCAKES. what a travesty. Now I'll have to make my own. 
@emedeme91 clearly I should always have these items on hand to make my own dressing.
@emedeme91 I don't or I would.
I did not cook shrimp for nothing!!
The problem with making Caesar salad is that you need Caesar dressing. I have a salad with no dressing. Desperate I am at the market now.
My ipod is nothing but @emilieautumn music and maybe some other bands. It's going to be amazing tomorrow
@Lavellann waffles are the best.
Can't start off the day without coffee! #selfie 
Date day with my fiancée! She looks hella cute today. (spoilers: she's always hella cute) #dateday 
Ahh yes. Watching Steven Universe on lunch break. Thanks new iPod.


I'm hella lame omg.
It's like my fav joke. "that was intense, like camping!" (say it out loud. Makes me giggle every time)
I just realized that was an inside joke. No pennies as in no cents..
@Lavellann she obviously makes no pennies.
Idk idk its worth a shot.
@Lavellann we're like 1/4th Mexican so maybe you can use my brother as an example on why middle names are cooler?
@Lavellann oh gosh. That sounds super exciting
@Lavellann but a lot of people go by middle names?!?! My brother does.
@alyloki omg perfect. Chocolate cake is usually the best
@alyloki cake sounds amazing. What kind of cake?
Here's hoping my day goes well! I'm having an interesting start to my morning. Yay.
Turning my day into hipster meme aesthetic. #selfie #over9000 
Just beat resident evil. I actually really enjoyed it even though I'm a pansy half the time ( and I was playing Barry!)
Well we meet again camera #selfie 
Yep. My life is complete. It's super pink and I love it. 
I bought my first iPod just so I can watch #StevenUniverse. I am super lame.
between @GlassAnimals and @ArcticMonkeys I'm totally inspired to write. Why am I at work?
Debating on figuring out the Streaming thing to motivate me to play more games or finish some.
Today is not my day. I just want to go home and finish resident evil and sleep. I'm so tired.
I'm going to end up crying all day today. Ugh I feel awful
Ugh. I feel like the worst. I hate being late to work
I'm so glad my wallet is across the room and I don't want to move. Except my PS4 is connected to my paypal and I want to buy #Bloodborne
I shouldn't look at things on the internet when i'm sad. I try and buy everything.
Totally healthy. I just ate all my chocolate because I am sad... and I haven't eaten anything else today.
Win a Year of Loot Crate! 
@alyloki xfiles is coming back!
omg the kitten keeps trying to play with my cat and my cat doesn't get she's trying to play. Persephone keeps hissing at her like omg kitten
ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS RESIDENT EVIL. Now that I've made the RIGHT choice. Let's finish it.
@mmprfanboy91 I'm hearing that was the only shipment. The WalMart i ended at let people grab 2 each.
My new desktop backround. #residentevil 
Fire. The word you want is fire mysterious intercom voice.  @emedeme91 i thought of you #residentevil #Greekmyth 
@emedeme91 I don't know. Probably not. It's exciting!
Yes. Today is a day of crying without knowing why. Thank you day.
Yep. Today is mostly me crying sporadically. This sucks.
Or I'll just nearly end up in tears on my shift. That's good. Great.
@emedeme91 I take requests. I'll start on that tonight. &lt;3
@emedeme91 I'll make it up to you. Maybe a happy story foe your feelings?
@emedeme91 well @EllaEyre's home came on after. 
@emedeme91 It came on my playlist I threw together and Crystal is just like "is this your Hades and Persephone playlist?" It wasn't. Lol
Ah yes. Music to make my day better. Hozier's Cherry Wine. #music
@emedeme91 
Thinking positive is difficult. I'm not sure why. Hopefully today will go well.
Ready for the day! Trying to think positive so have a selfie. 
"Where do I go when every no turns into maybe...." here goes my heart and my feelings. #underworldroyalty @emedeme91
When did my ocs become a problem, and how many are out there? I should write them all down one day, find my old d&amp;d binders... #writing
@Lavellann Eee you're the best. I always get so nervous about my ocs, haha.
@Lavellann 
@Lavellann I have a writing tag on my personal tumblr  now! My VaultofGlass journal hasn't been updated recently. Let me get you a link!
I'm also constantly torn going "do you even care about my ocs like really".
@Lavellann i feel this all the time.
There's a OC tumblr meme going around and I'm staring at is like "do you really want me to list all of my ocs in the tags" cause it's long.
I can't stop listening to @SirSly's entire CD. Inferno is my new favourite song. I hope I can catch them live if the tickets haven't sold.
Our kitten is scary good at attacking my hands. My hands look like a battle ground it's kind of awesome.
Also Dramamine is being bought next week! Maybe I'll finally play Hardline this week. #gaming
Here's hoping I'm not sick! Can't really call out of work.
Ahh yes. The problem with being allergic to meat: Realizing all the food might be cooked on the same grill after you've finished.
Out to dinner with the fiancee! She's doing homework for her master's classes. Love the bored expression, don't you? 
@_anthonynash She used to play Myst all the time too. I am super lucky she's very understanding about my video game habits.
@_anthonynash She's always supported us! It just makes me smile. We've gotten her to play Resident Evil before it's great.
I love it when my mom likes my video game posts on face book. It just makes me smile and idk why.
@GlassCityCon Hey! I'm not sure if you noticed the typo on your website. Pre-reg ends on April 31st, but there's only 30 days in April.
@EpicNameBro glad to hear that it's going to give the guide more though! Looking forward to it.
@mmprfanboy91 Good luck on the selling part! I figured if I don't find one it's not the end of the world. I could always attempt to trade.
Things I am going to end up doing because #amiibo is totally ruining my life: end up @Walmart looking for the Gold Mario.
I kind of miss writing for Destiny so... I'll attempt at the Black Garden story I've been meaning to write.
On my next day off (when I remember when that is) I am going to attempt at Destiny. Maybe finally finish Crota's End if I can get a group.
Always amused when I bring the ps4 into the living room. Stacked it with my fiancée's ps4. 
Picked up Toad from Gamestop! #Amiibo #amiibohunting apparently they can order him online too @AmiiboNews 
I feel super great today. No lie. 
@Lavellann but that is a nice selfie
Resident Evil is how my fiancee and I met. It's super nerdy and I'm so excited to be playing if with her.
I'm going to have intense Revelations 2 feelings for a while so I apologize now.
Super glad someone warned me about my choice in Resident Evil. Can't say I'm surprised it's bad end though.
@Lavellann @elementzeros I need to read more.
My beanie game is on point today. Picture to come soon.
@elementzeros any time!
Thank you dude who decided to be impatient and leave the drive thru. Your white mocha is delicious. #coffee
I am so happy for free coffee. I nearly got sad I was out and then I remembered that Starbucks made my morning.
@elementzeros your outfit is hella cute.
Going to restart chapter 3 today for Resident Evil. Someone spoiled me for the bad ending and now I can't have it. #residentevil
Already off to a good start! Got free coffee today. #blessthecoffeegods
I don't know how I feel about being eaten by invisible monsters...
I JUST GOT EATEN BY AN INVISIBLE MONSTER AND IT PUKED BABIES ON ME. Thank you @RE_Games .
@Lavellann Gotta go fast
@Lavellann omg jordan you can't just tell people they look like sonic
I totally forgot my 
@T10Torres Mario Party? I haven't played one in years so I hope not.
Just picked up #MarioParty10! Going to give that a go once I finish Resident Evil Revlations 2.
@pituvision Me too! Looks like you had fun at least. Looking forward to the next big amiibo adventure.
@pituvision ahh jealous! I woke up sick this morning so no gold mario for me. He looks great!
@EllaEyre Oh no the puppy is so precious! I don't blame you.
@AmiiboNews Not long at all was it? Goodness.
@MagicMan ohh what a great idea!I hope whoever finds them has a blast at your show!
@AmiiboNews It's on back order.
I decided to play Destiny for the first time in like weeks. I'm just sitting in a dark cave listening to the fallen get their asses kicked..
Things I eventually need to do: Import @SquareEnixJ's Final Fantasy Explorers. #gaming
I have to say I love this game. I hope it makes it to the states. Its a little like Ico meets .hack. #gaming 
ラビリンスの彼方 or Biohazard Revelations 2... The tough choices today. Maybe both! #gaming
Feeling cute in my schway Calvin Klein shirt in a car dealership. My hair is finally cooperating too! #selfie 
@sherbetsnow RIGHT?!
@sherbetsnow maybe they're unsure about the Smallpools or cake tweets...
@NintendoAmerica Rosalina because I think she's amazing (sorry Princess Peach!) #MP10LaunchParty #SweepsEntry
@NintendoAmerica super excited for Amiibo party. Going to use my peach Amiibo always #MP10LaunchParty #SweepsEntry
And how Annabella (as a dragon) met Lucas.
I think I am going to write about my necromancer. In which James and Annabella scream at each other and she learns Lucas is his brother.
I don't know why I am at work. I'm barely motivated. I'm surprised I'm talking.
Ugh I am having a bad day. I hope it gets better. I just want to lay down and not get up.
@NintendoAmerica True!  #MP10LaunchParty #SweepsEntry
@NintendoAmerica 5! #MarioLaunchParty10 #SweepsEntry
Today is Resident Evil day. I feel it in my bones. Tomorrow is ラビリンスの彼方.
Feeling like "unimaginative boss battles" are the new buzz words for game reviews. Not that they can't be true, but its a trend.
Going to brave Walmart for the gold Mario #Amiibo Friday. Wish me luck!
@ShaneWatch that case is beautiful.
Ahh yes. The morning coffee ritual. How goes your morning, twitter?
Wish I had the Biohazard flashlight for Moira. That thing is super rad. #residentevil
Who is ready for #ResidentEvilRevelations2? I think I am. Chapter four here I come...
On my way to meet the new recruits for TerraSave. #residentevil 
I'd rather stay home and write.
Oh I just did something to my knee... perfect and just what I need for my midnight tonight.
I need to write more for my stupid fantasy story. I'm a little nervous about it still.
ugh, i feel like my original characters are super boring. Worst feeling on the planet.
Jacket hemmed! Weird angle, I know. #Claireredfield #ResidentEvil 
Claire Redfield revelations 2 wig test + jacket. I need to fix it I think. #residentevil #claireredfield 
The collector in me is saying "GO TO EBAY AND LIVE YOUR DREAMS" but my wallet is telling me no... #residentevil
I would probably give a lot to get into the #Club96 stuff. Cause @RE_Games is one of my favourite franchises.
I am going to delete the fail tweet because I can now no longer let it see the light of day.
@rbm276 I took it for six years as a second language...and it does not show. I don't even know how I failed so bad at this.
CURS YOU JAPANESE KEYBOARD FOR FAILING ME ON MY LAPTOP. This would never have happened on my cell phone.
@rbm276 I was making a note that the Biohazard fan club in Japan is cool but I fucked up spelling Biohazard....
Dear @Capcom_Unity. Please bring the @RE_Games fan club to the states. It'd make this Resident Evil fan girl super happy.
Sitting in my roommates room rocking out to @theblackkeys's Fever. This is a good night.
@sherbetsnow Ohhhh food! Food is always amazing.
@sherbetsnow Ohhh nice! That sounds exciting.
@JessicaMerizan She looks gorgeous! Congratulations to her!
OH maybe not for @Smallpools! Yes! And @awolnation will be in Cincinnati too. I wonder if I could get that off work.
How is it that I've missed tickets for most of the bands I want to see? @smallpools and @WALKTHEMOONband both sold out in Ohio.
@sherbetsnow what con are you heading too?
@sherbetsnow OMG. I'm super excited now. Holy goodness. I forgot about that.
@sherbetsnow omg what. When? How!? And hope you have fun at the con!!
@sherbetsnow OMG I forgot you got me a shirt! ...i have a new address now lol
@sherbetsnow @smallpools TAKE ME OUT AND WE'LL KARAOKE~
@NintendoAmerica blue! And hella cute.
I just bought a Lego Thorin. @RCArmitage would be proud. #hobbit
Ahh yes. Going to get underwear. A fantastic field trip.
Feeling super cute today wearing my dress.  I missed wearing dresses. #Selfie 
@chrishemsworth welcome to twitter! Looking forward to seeing you around!
NOT COMFORTING @RE_Games @CAPCOM_UNITY #residentevil 
I'M IN A PIG!!!! #residentevil 
Four for you Claire for paying attention to Greek Mythology in school. #ResidentEvil
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PUZZLES. #ResidentEvil
We just found a herb in the toilet... I can't even. #Residentevil
@SigTauEli Guess I am going to brave Walmart when it releases for fun. Maybe I'll take amazing video.
I wish I knew what it said omg. Why is one of the symbols BY THE BATHROOM?!?!?!? We gonna die. #ResidentEvil
@SigTauEli Aww! I missed out on that one today, I was at work at the time. I hope you enjoy the Gold Mario!
Ah yes. Always comforted by wall warnings I CAN'T READ. #residentevil 
@SigTauEli And my fiancee drove like an hour to get MetaKnight for me. We've become Amiibo hunters, it's a thing now.
@SigTauEli It was rough, no lie. I actually traded my second Pit figure for Rosalina. I was hoping to paint him down the line to be Dark Pit
@SigTauEli Right! I cannot wait. I really want Ness, but I know I am just going to end up with like all of them.
@SigTauEli It's become an obsession! I'm really looking forward to the rerelease of Marth. He looks so great in that photo of yours too!
@SigTauEli @AmiiboNews Congratulations! He looks so good!
I think I have an #Amiibo problem. It's uh... Exciting. Thanks @NintendoAmerica 
@RE_Games can't wait! It's going to make this rainy day better.
Ah yes, the morning @Starbucks addiction begins. I'm going to really need my coffee today.
Tomorrow. Start writing an oc guide. For future reference. #writing
I should post a massive character list of all the ocs I write about that aren't my destiny ocs. A master post might help.
@emedeme91 probably about my stupid necromancer but we'll see. i have so many feelings about so many characters I should post about them.
@emedeme91 I have fun with it! I think that's why my Destiny stuff works so well. I am planning on writing another oc thing soon.
@emedeme91 Probably because it's cute as shit (like all your art). I'm not sure if maybe my original stuff isn't as interesting. ha/deadcat.
@emedeme91 This is true.
@emedeme91 Which don't get me wrong I love it, I love writing for underworld royalty. It's fun.
@emedeme91 AMAZING. Idek. I feel like no one reads my oc stuff BUT SUDDENLY NOTES EVERYWHERE FOR MY FAN FICTION FOR DOMESTIC UNDERWORLD?
@emedeme91 THANKS. THANKS. I need to learn the ways of doing this with my ocs. SOME HOW I MANAGE IT FOR EVERYONE ELSE?
@emedeme91 WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS.
I'm emotionally compromised by my friends ocs. All of them. All my friends. Your OCS are fabulous.
@VakarianX @Lavellann Oh my goodness that shader is gorgeous!
I may have a slight @RE_Games problem... (not featured is the fifth anniversary briefcase) 
Just platformed my way down the #Vaultofglass and idk where i am. That way up there is where the first chest is. 
I don't think that's an alpaca.... (the weird one's name is Poseidon). 
I bought a tv today!! Now I can online co op with my fiancée I now live with. #gaming 
@RevenantRosales I am looking forward to the rest of it. Raid Mode is absolutely hilarious with the gestures though.
Started playing ラビリンスの彼方 for the 3ds and goodness its gorgeous! Helps me practice my Japanese that's for sure.
I'm going to cry over this stupid game. I'm suddenly obsessed again. It's terrible.
Shit. Shit. Shit. #ResidentEvilRevelations2
FUCK THIS GAME. IF SHE DIES. I QUIT.
@RevenantRosales I'm currently playing it split screen until I get a TV. I thought it did have Co-Op online! Oh this is going to be exciting
Run. Run faster. Run further away - anything to escape her fears. Fear was dangerous, she needed to cover come them. She can't die like this
#ResidentEvil is ruining my life I am sorry about this. and I have to fix the writing tweet because of a spelling mistake...
Resident Evil Revelations 2 gives me so much life. This is a much needed edition of the survival horror franchise.
Things I'd love to be at right now: GDC. One day I will work in the gaming field. It's a dream of mine. Writing mostly.
wielding * oops.
@AyeItsPetrovic You're now a chainsaw weilding zombie. Enjoy that, that's for you.
"He is behind you right?" "No he got eaten. He's fucking dead." About Pedro, probably. #ResidentEvil
@TheSeti12345 The problem is that people buy up rare ones to sell to make money. Reselling for profit happens unfortunatelyoften with toys.
@TheSeti12345 I don't actually spend a lot of money to get them, just the normal retail price.
@TheSeti12345 Because unfortunately they're relatively difficult to find. On top of that, certain stores got exclusive ones.
OH GREAT. THANKS OVERSEER. THAT'S LOVELY INFO. BRILLIANT. #ResidentEvil
TIME FOR SOME MORE RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS 2.
Eating chocolate cadbury eggs because they cheer me up. yay.

@AyeItsPetrovic Pfft okay but I am going to be playing Resident Evil later.
@AyeItsPetrovic test your network connections, it should clear up the NAT issues.
@madphilb YES
Taking a break from Destiny to sort out some clothing. So watching Big Hero 6 again.
Please give to me a chest piece for my titan. Or more armor so I can break it down and upgrade shit.
Ah yes. The grind.
COME ON. GIVE TO ME A FAB CHEST PIECE FOR MY TITAN. I just want to be a higher level then I am...
@MagicMan nooo I was trying to get those tickets too, no wonder it didn't work. Have fun at least!
OKAY. LEVEL 27 TITAN HERE I COME.
Ran nightfall for the first time in weeks, got twelve strange coins. Splendid.
@chai Me too! I hope you had a blast at least. I've done nothing but listen to his CD since I bought it.
Have I told you #Amiibo's have ruined my life? Because I am going to brave Walmart for the Gold Mario...
Ahh yes. the best way to cheer me up. Sit down and watch Top Gear.
@chai ugh ugh ugh so jealous. His concert here sold out super quickly. HAVE FUN!! (And happy birthday!)
@AyeItsPetrovic It's just how I do.
@AyeItsPetrovic LOL perfect. I'll get my ass up early so we can play &lt;3
@AyeItsPetrovic I am off tomorrow. Want to play some Destiny?
Hey @AyeItsPetrovic what are you doing tomorrow?
@AyeItsPetrovic LOL My Scooby Doo knowledge apparently helped me in the end. GO ME.
@AyeItsPetrovic Casey Kasem or Matthew Lillard?
Ugh everything I write is trash.
@EpicNameBro It's in the grass isn't it? I think I see ears.
@NintendoAmerica yes finally! I missed Marth the first time so this makes me infinitely happy. Soon my #Amiibo collection will be complete!
I might just stick to posting fan related works going forward.
Feeling really down about my writing lately. I feel like my original stuff doesn't get noticed a lot. That's probably my fault.
@EvilosArt wow. very doge. so bitcoin.
@vulgarTruths I might be finally picking that up to give it a go!
Ahh yes. I have a day off Tuesday. What video game should I play?
I forgot I really hate the snow. Why am I in Ohio again?
@RE_Games Revelations 2 is my new favourite obsession. I can't wait until Episode 2. BUT THAT ENDING TO EPISODE ONE THOUGH?
Finally opened up my #Amiibo's! They're super cute and we celebrated getting #Rosalina 
@EvilosArt @Nintendo absolutely amazing work! Looking forward to the giveaway!
Success! Shady Craigslist trade went down perfect. Someone is going home with Pit and I now have Rosalina! #Amiibo 
@AyeItsPetrovic ahhh that is so nice!
Not the island vacation Steve promised. #residentevil 
Magical adventure to get Rosalina #Amiibo tomorrow. Fingers crossed its not a scam. Hopeful Amiibo trade.
@Lavellann beautiful
@EvilosArt ahhh congratulations! Have fun!
@AyeItsPetrovic maybe when I get home tonight! I'm off at 930.
@AyeItsPetrovic I'm at work 8(
@emedeme91 LOL OMG yes
@emedeme91 BECAUSE PRINCE CHARMING SMELLS LIKE POMEGRANATE
Rest in peace, Leonard Nimoy. You will be greatly missed.
@emedeme91 so crystal bought a new shower gel and I have underworld royalty feelings and its amazing. 
@AmiiboNews @StreetPassNYC amazing!
YES I may be finally getting my Rosalina #Amiibo! We'll find out tomorrow how well this is going to go. Not going alone to pick her up.
Just woke up, I'm confused about this dress business. What on earth is everyone debating?
@SumoDigitalLtd @SEGA actually racing as Ulala from Space Channel 5 and Beat from Jet Set Radio.
I'm attempting to get up but my cat had other plans. Cat attack! 
@DinoVideo true! Considering this isn't all of them...
Getting stuff together is amazing and painful. Also I have way too many books. 
@UHaul_Cares heck yeah! Made my night.
Just reaffirms my want to buy a truck for my next car.
Driving a U-Haul. I feel like I've found my new calling. Short trucker. Aw yeah.
I'm done. @Capcom_Unity please take me away. Revelations 2 is a freaken gem. I love it so much.
First death! All my fault too. #Residentevil 
@AyeItsPetrovic Well if you need to talk let me know okay &lt;3? I know I am playing a game but it's a scary game because I'm a chicken.
Oh great. #residentevil 
@AyeItsPetrovic Oh?
Especially at all the zombies trying to eat me.
I can't even with Claire's face now. The rest of this chapter I'm just going to be quoting "Hey kids wanna buy some herbs".
@alyloki @Lavellann Done! Fingers crossed!
@alyloki @Lavellann What are you retweeting to win and can I help?
I love doing that shit.
@Lavellann DYING
Whhhhhhhhhhhhy.  #lotrquotes #Residentevil 
Claire!!!!! #Residentevil I am so glad to see your face! 
HELL YES STARTING RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS 2.
@emedeme91 you have ruined my writing today. It's all your fault. Enjoy that.

Idk if I'll write any more lol now I'm too nervous. How did this happen
@Lavellann march in all "GIVE ME FATEBRINGER OR GIVE ME DEATH" and then ten strange coins later...
I owe you a face later @emedeme91. I'm torn between a human and an elf. Maybe I'll do both and go from there.
@Lavellann to give a challenge I say as I weep into ice breaker...
@emedeme91 THAT WAS MY IDEA. SERIOUSLY. Just staring a far going "gonna talk to her today".
This week he'll just sigh and say "maybe tomorrow." #writing @emedeme91 sorry not sorry.
By her long blond hair. Today he'll walk up and ask, "Nadia would you mind studying with me." And when she walks by for the fourth time
Today he'll ask her if she wouldn't mind studying with him. Today was the day her smile wouldn't intimidate and he wouldn't be distracted
@Lavellann lol I'd be a little sad but amused by the outrage.
Feeling better about wearing my binder out. Time to grocery shop.
Okay now with less spelling mistakes. #selfie vault of glass shirt like nerd I am. 
@fyouabstergo It's okay. I've separated them for now. I'm going to keep it that way the rest of the day if that's cool.
I have to finish downloading @SirSly's stuff. how do I only have Gold in my itunes?!
Listening to @smallpools Karaoke again because it's so much fun to listen to omg. 
@fyouabstergo I have to get stuff for the carpet so. I am going to throw myself into the shower and go real quick.
@fyouabstergo She trapped choco in the litter box while she was trying to use it. I had to get her out of there and choco freaked a bit.
Writing a short story for a Dragon Age OC in a little bit. First trip the grocery store, then DAI face thing, then story time.
I'm panicking slightly because my cat's been with me forever so, this is exciting.
Ugh, worried about my cat. She keeps vomiting. Think it's stress related due to the kitten so separating them for a bit.
“Avela, you’re putting your cigarettes out in your coffee ag-- did you just drink that!?” #Destinythegame 
@emedeme91 YEAH IT'S A THING. I'm gonna write something small after I go stare at DAI for like a few hours to make a face.
So did a little original character writing tonight. Maybe I'll do more with him.
Okay. #Destiny writing tomorrow because I lost the whole thing when I forgot to save.
@EvilosArt @SleepyJirachi Ahh that pikachu is super cute! I love your work.Congratulations to the winner!
(haha now with less spelling mistakes. This is exciting.)
What are the chances I can walk into Target and find a #Rosalina #Amiibo? She's the one I really want. I might end up just importing her.
@pituvision That's terrible. Good luck to the people who are actually submitting art at least!
@pituvision Are people really trying to pass off other people's work? that's awful.
Debating on applying for a job where I would need to use my Japanese. Kind of a scary thought really.
Not from her perspective, but how. How I ask. Curse you inspiration for striking out of the blue!
I suddenly had a story idea for @emedeme91's new mage oc and I don't think she has a name yet omg.
@pituvision I am too! I bought a Kirby in celebration. Still looking for Rosalina though.
@emedeme91 I always like your characters. &lt;3
@pituvision I missed the cut off. My fiancee found one tucked behind some Bowsers so we got lucky.
@pituvision he was hard to grab omg. Did you preorder him?
@emedeme91 because they're interesting and you're flawless?
@emedeme91 I want to make an oc for her lol. How dare you inspire my creativity.
@pituvision oh yay! Glad you got him!
@_IgKnight I'll be tweeting them in the newt few days! You can check the rest out @ 
Oh no @emedeme91 your new circle mage is hot.
Yay new district, new conference call. Let's rock.
I'm just feeling down about my writing lately. I haven't written anything in a week.
I have two #Destinythegame stories in the work. One is the Black Garden mission, the other is a vault of glass story. #writing
@EvilosArt man I didn't know they went up for sale! Hoping to grab one next time. I was at work waiting for a link.
@madphilb omg let me tell you. I had to talk to my -mom- not the professor.
Horribly intense feelings over @theblackkeys Weight of Love. 
@Lavellann oh nooo.  Now the hard bit is do I actually pick it up or tell the guy in Florida to not bother shipping it to me.
@Lavellann lol i have the super special awesome collectors edition preordered. am i boned?
@Lavellann ALSO ORDER 1886? IS IT WORTH IT? I can't get mine yet cause uh it's in Florida still.
@Lavellann I KNOW I SAY I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD but i have to drive in the snow tomorrow. so excited (not really)
@Lavellann I'm writing right now and then heading to bed, but maybe tomorrow after I get off work?
I'd like to run the Vault on hard again. And maybe FINALLY FINISH CROTA'S END. #destiny
Tomorrow I'm organizing my books and stuff, and then soon I will have a dresser. Maybe I can play #Destiny after the organizing.
I asked a friend who plays like every Pokemon ever what I was supposed to do, except I tried reading her the Japanese dialogue. #videogames
#Pokemon is super easy to read, but sometimes I am like "WHO THE HECK AM I SUPPOSED TO TALK TO?"
I have to say, I love playing my games in Japanese. It keeps me on my toes until I forget what someone is saying in a game... #Videogames
I'm catching up on Pokémon memories with Pokémon Pearl... #ポケモン 
My fiancee is the best!! #Amiibo drove 40 minutes out of her way for the last one. 
@AyeItsPetrovic Maybe tomorrow?
@AyeItsPetrovic That's fine! I was just making sure. Take care of yourself okay? I'm going to bounce for the night then.
Heeeey @AyeItsPetrovic we going to roll through the Nightfall? It's hilariously rough.
Oh my goodness I just spent like. Way too long on the Sword of Crota mission. #Destiny
@Lavellann WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
Everytime I go to the moon I think of the live action commercial for #Destiny "Knock Knock" "Who's there?" and rocket to the hellmouth
Nothing on @DestinyTheGame but my biggest problem with the moon is all the closed spaces. Messes with my motion sickness like no other.
Oh man motion sickness. I hate the moon SO MUCH. Some help my baby hunter off the moon. #destiny #gamerproblems
@LadieAuPair Yes! I love it. I heard they even fall over from time to time.
@LadieAuPair Makes me super excited for when I get mine. I probably have more downloaded games then she does.
@LadieAuPair I've been hearing that it takes forever. She did it while I was at work so I am pretty sure she's set up.
@LadieAuPair I probably would too. I was such a bad student, haha. She's in a masters program or else she might.
@LadieAuPair Yay! I am so happy. My fiancee flipped out when I brought it home for her. If she didn't have homework it'd be Zelda-o-clock.
Ahhh it arrived! Did yours come in @LadieAuPair? 
@OneLetter I am super excited now. Decking my Ps4 in the Order theme tomorrow in preparation for the release.
@OneLetter @TheOrder1886 I just got mine to work after you posted this tweet!
Everyone I know who can help me with the daily mission is playing Crota's End... what is life.
Every day I'm #amiibo hunting. This is now become a problem. Thanks @NintendoAmerica
@TimJohnson80 If it has the sticker I'll tweet you tomorrow. Lucario doesn't have the sticker! I got lucky, Toys R Us didn't put it on him.
@TimJohnson80 If I can grab a second Shulk, maybe. There's one at a Gamestop up the street from me, I'll check that tomorrow for you!
@TimJohnson80 I have Lucario mainly. Sheik too.
@TheOrder1886 @ZookeyTK ahhh that looks super great in person! I'm totally jealous.
@pituvision How many of those Mario bundles are there? I may need to budget for this, lol.
@Lavellann OHH that's a rad as hell shader!
@pituvision Just contract people. I'll hit up Target, you hit up WalMart. We'll go down with the amiibo ship.
Okay, maybe this could work. Anyone on twitter have a spare Rosalina #Amiibo for trade?
@Lavellann Rooting for you lucky warlock!
Avela is so freaken pretty. #destiny 
The black garden is so pretty. 
@Lavellann but how
@DrakeBell A steak pun is a rare medium well done. (always makes me laugh)
OKAY. Going to replay the Black Garden mission here soon. Should be fun. Yay.
@Lavellann Every time you tweet things like this I am like "THAT IS HORRIFYING OMG" and end up in a fit of giggles.
I had to get the theme for Transistor. I'm still in love with that game and everyone should buy it. @SupergiantGames is brilliant.
Transistor theme!!! 
I forgot how much I hate snow omg.
Omfg. Level 2 snow emergency in Cincinnati. "Are you still open I need to buy a game." You don't need a game that bad!
@vulgarTruths ohhh I like it. I'll replay the black garden mission when I get home then.
I need to write something destiny related. Suggestions?
Bored at work in a snow storm. What do?
Oh goodness what have I done. 
Ugh I hate the moon. Mostly cause of the motion sickness. It's the absolute worst. Someone play the moon missions for me.
Waiting for that golden gun...#destiny 
NEXT STOP WITH BABY HUNTER: THE MOON. #destinythegame
Once I hit level 20 with my Hunter I'm not going to know what to do with myself. Like. I have gear for him already. #Destinyproblems
@Lavellann @alyloki @AntTheDreamer @R_I_P_BUBBY2 @piinkskittlez @AndroidQuinn GO FIGHT AND WIN!
Baby hunter gonna die fighting the hive. I knew the well.... #Destiny
Or level up my BABY HUNTER who still needs a name..
OKAY. ROUND TWO WITH DESTINY. Do I try and punch Omnigul in the face or finish the Eris quest line with my Titan...
I kept dying so I quit Destiny for now. Maybe pick it back up later.
ffuuuuuck gonna die again
Do I really want to go and get my ass kicked again? Probably. Let's do this again. #destinythegame
Also I keep punching Omnigul in the face. Totally deserves it tbh.#TheDarkBelow #destiny 
Yes Igot my stupid shader! #destiny #TheDarkBelow 
I GAVE UP ON DYING FOR NOW. I should really change my weapons. #Destiny
I am awful at this game. Who wants to help me with the warmind?
DAMNIT. I keep getting killed by wizards why.
FUUUUUUCK I died.
I'M GONNA DIE #destiny
Coming to save you Rasputin. Sing at me pls. #destinythegame
HELLO #DESTINY, I HAVE MISSED YOU SO.
So what's up twitter? How are you today?
Ahh yes, making new friends at a target Starbucks.
I'm pleasantly warm right now. I'm wearing layers. Best part is that my jacket is my Sherry Birkin cosplay. 
@Lavellann well then. They're super smart.
@coltenryanx I'm out and about running errands. I might be on later in the evening.
@Lavellann omg rude. Why would you not ask to join?
Oh hey @incatek. I should be free later this evening for the VoG!
@incatek LOL I may have to now. Have a name for your Guardian?
Madness you will never touch. Heed her warning. Crota must be stopped or we will all lose our Light. #Destiny #ErisMorn
Listen well, Guardian. You think her mad, but the horrors she's seen will keep you awake. Nightmares you could never dream about.
Crota. The son of Oryx. God king of the Hive will topple at her feet. Her laughter would drive him mad as she cuts him down with his blade.
The Hive took her life. She would pay them back tenfold. Let the Darkness consume her so Light could blind them. #Destiny
Now she crawls through long dark halls. Third eye glowing, grasping dust and rock as if it will save her misstep. Spying on her enemy.
Crota. She promised to destroy him and in turn he laughed at the audacity. The Light Eater would gladly take her, turn her light against her
Shuddering, shivering in the pit, begging for mercy she knew he would never show. Praying that she will crawl out and live. #Destiny #Eris
She screams out in pain. Anguish written on her face. She died in the darkness, hands covering her eyes: the Darkness burned. #Destiny #Eris
Baby it's cold outside. I clearly need a warmer coat. Soon they will all be on sale because Spring is near. #wamcoatforsydney2015
@PTibz But think of all the butts you could kick in Super Smash....
I move to Ohio and I started to fall apart. I am calling shenanigans.
@emedeme91 so it's done. I started it last night and then I stood up to get something and my knee gave out. It was exciting!
Someone is listening to very loud rap music in our apartment and all I hear is the baseline. It's kind of amazing.
@emedeme91 &lt;3 We try. I just like making my friend smile.
Writing today, and blaming my fiancee and @emedeme91 (and hoping it help cheers her up.)
Out with the fiancee. Making me feel like the shortest dude around.
Feeling a little self conscious about it though.
Dressed up for Valentines dinner. May need a different binder though. 
Violets are blue.
I hope the moon
Doesn't fall on you.
I'm also alive, in one piece. It's exciting to be in one piece.
HEY @incatek I am officially in Ohio. Sup?
WHAT HAVE WE DONE?! #amiibo #Nintendo 
Made it to Ohio! Now its time for bed.
Omg it has hearts!! #coffee @Starbucks 
@Lavellann omg u nerd
Ahh yes I am glad I live on @Starbucks. Coffee on a long road trip is amazing.
@Lavellann 8|
OH NO I LEFT ALL MY COFFEE IN FLORIDA. I can't turn around for coffee... I've already asked.
@Lavellann GEE THANKS FOR REAFFIRMING I'M A HUGE NERD.
I'm a huge nerd.
I must be a sight to look at because I talk with my hands and I'm wearing my vault of glass shirt. #destiny
I just spent the last hour and a half explaining the story of #Destinythegame to my friend who is driving my car.
Amazing thought in the car about @DestinyTheGame. What if the exo stranger was Eriana-3? #destiny
Still on the road. Heading through Tennessee and on our way to Kentucky. Listening to #altnation with the fab @RadioMadison
Dumb faces on the road to Ohio. Hello from the last fifty miles of Georgia. #roadtoohio 
"we must. We must! We can enter the vault from any point in time. Time is subjective so what is Atheon's game?" #writing
"Everytime we enter the vault we fight Atheon. Everytime we stop the conflux, do we remove ourselves from time?" She thinks out loud.
So anyway. Story time! I had a writing thought.
So I am pretty sure I pissed off my kitty earlier when I tried to console her on her long journey to her new home. 
@fyouabstergo and I have made it to Butts County. #movingroadtrip #OhiohereIcome
Just hit Georgia! Making some good time right now.
@incatek if you end up going to do the vault just tweet me. I'm finishing up packing and the ps4 will be packed last.
Hey @incatek are you guys running the end of VoG tonight or would you mind putting it odd til tomorrow?
@SupergiantGames I know what I'm buying when I get home!
What are the chances when we finish the hard mode tomorrow I'll get Chatterwhite.....
finally got some raid gear from the Vault!
In the mean time I am super happy with my new hunter. His face is amazing.
Ahh the oracle glitched.
Ahh yes. Oracles. They are probably the most fascinating thing about the VOG imo.
We both hear "it's clear" and we die trying to leave a hole in the wall. We can SO do the VOG on hard...
@AyeItsPetrovic Ah! Have fun!
omg is Bane helping you now? @AyeItsPetrovic
I can't even pick up orbs of light! #destiny 
I miss having double jump. #Destiny
Decided to remake my hunter. #destiny 
Ahhh yes.  fist of Crota mission, in which I should probably complete it with my Titan.
@Lavellann Splendid! I'll let you know. I'll see who is still on after I finish Fantasia.
@Lavellann I still have the Ir Yut checkpoint. Curse you death singer!!
@Lavellann i just started fantasia how dare you. I have like an hour and a half the movie left.
@Lavellann &lt;3 It was fun playing with you! We'll need to do it again! Hopefully with less phone calls, haha.
@Lavellann I am super sorry about the phone calls all of a sudden. It's like everyone wanted to talk to me at once.
@TheOrder1886 That keychain is adorable.
@Lavellann Oh man that's super great!
Vanguard Roc.playlist. Aw yeah.
There's so many people here. It's a little overwhelming. Ahh art.
Oh I wish i could take a picture of the art from the Ovid book that Picasso drew for.
at the Salvador Dali museum in St. Petersburg and they have a Picasso exhibit!
@VietKnight I want that ship so bad.
New Bella and Sebastian song? I love it. Glad I have Sirius xm again.
Today in writing: Stupid happy date things. Yep.
Tomorrow, maybe, I'll finish Crota's End. I have a checkpoint with Ir Yut and I'd like to actually go against Crota. #Destiny
I got another Vision of Confluence and Praedyth's Timepiece. #destiny
My fav bit from the vog. Everyone is dead and I'm surrounded. #destiny 
Dance party on a random platform in the vog #destiny 
AHH WE KILLED A GORGON.
Not really. I like the Gorgon maze more.
Ah yes the Templar. My favourite part of the Vault. #Destiny
@rbm276 Will do!
Running Vault of Glass on hard. Let's do this.
@incatek Thanks! I'll let you know if it changes.
@incatek Oh god if I wasn't feeling sick I might. I got motion sick earlier playing so I'm still reeling from that. Maybe in an hour?
Or I am going to have to stop playing destiny because of motion sickness. I should have taken Dramamine...
Ahh yes. Destiny. In which I sit in orbit for an hour trying to think of what I want to do.
Back home again. Time to decide on if I want to attempt at Crota's End tonight to finish it.
It felt wrong, lol. Probably not doing it again. Neat spot to snipe though! Glad I had Ice Breaker.
I'm really excited. Though I learned of a new cheese spot for the game. It was a bit of a pain to get up to so idk how worth it it was.
Okay. Hopefully trying the end of Crota's raid tonight. I have a check point with Ir Yut.
Packing up right now! There might be one or two boxes after this but that's the bulk of it. I might cry. 
@Lavellann It's okay. I don't think I'm going to finish the raid tonight.
Yeah. #destiny #TheDarkBelow 
YES WE MADE IT ACROSS THE BRIDGE.
@Lavellann Well we have an open spot if you want to join. I'm like "omg why guys" at this.
We have a dreadful team going on. I'm so not sure how I feel about this.
Ahh yes. He ditched us. That's nice.
I really should have picked a better night to do this Crota raid...
Oh no I think some kid just joined our team. What is this.
This is going super well. lol we can't even get across the bridge. We're a really poor team.
Haha I am not very good at this at all.
Running Crota's End! Let's do this shit.
@Lavellann I'M SORRY.
@rbm276 I got Hawkmoon. Which isn't like really a Bad Thing for me. But my friend(s) has been trying to get it for a long time.
Oh noooooooo #destiny 
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I JUST GOT HAWKMOON. In the same party as @AyeItsPetrovic oh goodness I am so sorry.
@emedeme91 OH I JUST SAW YOUR TAGS. sorry for those feelings....
Hanging out with a friend before I leave Florida and we decided to go for sushi. I'm making a dumb face. 
@emedeme91 Oh?
@Lavellann I look forward to it.
Okay the gentleman in @TheOrder1886 Order Exposed video is very attractive. Hope he doesn't get hurt though in trying to uncover the truth.
We've come full circle. @Lavellann's posts are starting to show up on my dash reblogged from other people.
@PTibz @devonsoft That looks deadly and delicious! I hope it is. (Delicious, not deadly.)
@daerapraxidice @emedeme91 I wrote a thing! Check tumblr when you have a chance, I know you're at school.
@emedeme91 I think I will always blame you and @daerapraxidice for my intense greek mythology feelings.
I am still super happy with my latest Destiny story. I read it over again to see if I hate it and I don't. I really like it. Is that silly?
Vault of Glass aesthetic. Complete with wing ear clip. 
Ugh #Persona5 hype is real. I am so excited.
Oh my goodness @Lavellann why. Now I can't get that mental image out of my head. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
@Lavellann I'm a little afraid right now.
Congratulations @SupergiantGames for the Sprite Award! Transistor deserves it. #Transistor #DICEAwards
@WildLilFlower WELL. I AM KIND OF FLAILING MY ARMS AT MY COMPUTER.
And now I internally freak out because I actually tweeted bungie my story.
Going to do some laundry so I can wear it with some skinny jeans tomorrow and my awesome beanie thing.
Also in the mean time: Hipster Destiny Chic is a new thing. I got my Vault of Glass shirt in today from @Bungie!
@DeeJ_BNG All of them, clearly. Make those who follow hungry.
Eris spoke over the intercom, static in the background ... #Destiny @Bungie #writing 
I am hoping I got Eris's vocal patterns down right. I took some of the ambient dialogue and used it because it's so unique. #Destinythegame
I think I am really proud of this next @DestinyTheGame fan fiction I am posting here in a moment.
@Lavellann super jealous RN.
Okay. Here's my plan. The moves will be here over the weekend, but I should be free to play #Destiny on Monday before I move. Who is game?
@HollyConrad oh yay! I'm super excited now.
Wrote a new story the other night I'm super proud of. I might tweet it a little later.
I'm thinking about getting a bird in the future. Hey @HollyConrad what would you recommend for a first time bird owner?
Today I am hipster Destiny nerd. #selfie 
BIG BIG NEWS

@emedeme91  well then I'm sorry to keep you waiting while I'm at work. Lol
@emedeme91 I might wrote more for them later today. The first person story was a warm up 8|
@emedeme91 how dare you give me underworld royalty feelings this early in the morning.
I just remembered I don't really enjoy writing in the first person so I hope that mini story reads well. #writing
@LadieAuPair ahhh that is super cute! You look great in it.
Someone come pack for me. I'll cook. It'll be great.
I feel super unengaged right now at work. Might mostly rest on the stress of moving. I don't want to pack any more.
I am so close to being done with packing. Its like the worst part of moving.
Intense packing happening today.
I hate my 'e's in that because Avela writes normal 'e's. Mine are backwards 3's
I found index cards!! How dangerous. #Destiny #writing 
Got a new scarf! And I found my glasses. 
I wish I posted this yesterday but @Xbox's Cortana called it. 
@emilieautumn @MarcSenter who doesn't want to see you two do Hamlet?
@TheSeti12345 ohhh that's tough. See what's on sale? There's some great games but idk for £10.
I was like "YEAH GOING TO PACK" and then this happened. 
@crecenteb that's a lot of iPhones! Sell them maybe?
I have to finish packing. I'm exhausted by this. I feel overwhelmed by it.
I'm sitting at work feeling super lost. Like I don't know what I'm doing with myself. I don't want to be here I just want to be home.
A goofy movie is the best Disney movie. I'll fight everyone on that.
Going through and old cd and apparently I have Powerline on here. A Goofy Movie music!?
Ending up crying over musicals on the way to work. How did this even happen.
@Lavellann Ahhh thank you! I am glad you love it. &lt;33
Oh no I just went into a rant about Dragon Age... how did this even happen?
@Lavellann this is absolutely terrifying omg
@Lavellann Thanks! Have fun playing games!
Niilo decided he would not join them in the depths of the Hellmouth. Crota was not his concern #destiny  
@Lavellann It's based off the details you gave me earlier, so fingers crossed haha. I'm posting it now then.
@Lavellann Did you want to read it over before I post it in case I need to do some tweaking?
"Icarus-7 if you can bake a decent cake, then I will personally punch Crota in the face." #Destinywriting
you're just making me hungry."
"No. Don't you dare go bribing me with cake. The hive give me the .... I don't know the heebie jeebies!" "But think of the cake!" "See now--
@Lavellann Well he did kind of sneak up on her. Gosh I hope I get this right for you, omg.
@Lavellann "You should pay attention around you, Zo. He's here as well.""Ah hell, fucking Icarus-7 what are you doing here?" (Example)
Hey @Lavellann is Zo pretty vulgar?
Ahh yes. Starting the story "In which Icarus-7 bribes someone with cake."
@regaliis I get motion sick really easily, I understand. It takes some getting used to but that's what he first missions are great for.
@regaliis If you ever get the time, it's a lot of fun (at least I think it is). The story is a little lacking, but I still really enjoy it.
@regaliis Like this was one of my first characters in the Alpha. 
@regaliis Rowan's design is super fun. I really like the character creator no lie. I had a lot of fun with it in the Beta and the Alpha.
@regaliis I know! Though I totally forgot that Rowan was Awoken. I thought she was human for some reason.
grafted: Fire Team. #Destiny 
Icarus-7 as well. I had him looking like this before. 
HA. Posted the fire team group for my Destiny writing stuff. I think I finally settled on what Niilo looks like. I was so torn.
Oh my goodness I got Rowan's race wrong. She's Awoken. I'm hella smart.
Also one of my favorite @RE_Games that is in my collection. 
Holy goodness things I just found in my room! 
Better picture of my outfit. Minus the skinny jeans. 
Icarus-7 confirmed as a baker. An exo who bakes and adores his human girlfriend.
That's it. That's the line km going to use. "But Zo think of the cake."
"Oh no. Don't go tempting me with cake." "Cupcakes, cake, tiramisu, lady fingers.." "Now you're just making me hungry." @Lavellann?
Icarus-7 to Zo. "But think of the cake."


@Lavellann you're sweet omg.
(Crota, the son of Oryx)
I need to write the story of how Icarus-7 convinces Zo to go down into the Hellmouth after Crota.
I'll take a picture of the full outfit in a moment.
Gratuitous selfie day. I am feeling cute as hell. 
What on earth do I want to write about tonight?
@Lavellann I want your style.



Hopefully, I can reveal some more surprises soon!
Yes! New hat! I've been waiting for a few weeks for it to come in. 
Time for a quick showed and to clean out my car then.
I had the most surreal experience. I thought I wad awake and packing. Reality was I was asleep and not wanting to move.
@AyeItsPetrovic I'll link you in the morning. I posted it on my tumblr.
@LadieAuPair I don't blame you! I had a lot of people tell me theirs was cancelled. I'm glad it worked out though!

Hey! @AyeItsPetrovic I have proof of your brilliance now. I finally got the video of you running through the gate to the VOG off my PS4.
Once we remember what Rowan looks like, I am going to post Avela's fireteam on tumblr. Because I like the destiny character creator.
@regaliis Hunter!

I am thinking about doing a Destiny themed giveaway if I hit 100 followers on my writing blog. I didn't think it'd take off like it did.
I already want to rewrite my tiny story. Oh man.
"Eyes up, Guardian?" The lights flicker on, everything into focus as he stares up at the sky. #Destiny 
@LadieAuPair Yay! I am super glad. I keep hearing horror stories at work and I was like "Oh no I hope she didn't get hers cancelled."
Oh hey! @LadieAuPair are you going to post pictures of the new 3DS when you get it? Best Buy didn't cancel it right?
@Lavellann  I am super happy for you omg.
Amused that 2NE1's "I Am The Best" is on a @Microsoft Surface Pro 3 commercial.
But this is after I pack some more things, clean my car out, and get the oil changed.
Okay. Tomorrow: try and get a group together for Vault of Glass or Crota's End. I just want to run Crota's End once.
It's amazing the things people say to me at work. I'm always astounded by condescending attitudes people walk in with.
Man I love how absolutely vile gamers can be some days. I don't know if it's gotten worse or better  or what, but damn boys.
I have intense feelings over stupid things.
@Lavellann a little jealous. Still haven't run the raid completely omg
@Lavellann yay! That's exciting.
I really cannot thank everyone enough for reading my writing. It feels great to write again.
Icarus-7 story will go up today. I think I finally know how to start it.
So @Lavellann how was Crota's End last night? The stream wouldn't work for me.
@Ayeltspetrovic finally got something nice from the nightfall!! #destiny 
@Lavellann LOL omg
Got a new helmet from the nightfall. #destiny 
@Lavellann I am fucking dying omfg.
Several hundred gigs omg. I'm like stunned at their idea of helping her clean up the computer.
Like we're talking several gigabytes of movies and tv shows. Returned to said friend and it slowed down from there.
People are amazing. Helping a friend clean up a laptop for sale and the last person who offered to do that downloaded movies to it.
Vet out take. 
Going to destroy omnigul tonight. So ready
Took my kitty to the vet. Got her shots. 
Done! 
I have something planned for Icarus-7 later today. I'm just not sure how to start it.
Ahh yes. Rambling about my OCs.
Avela runs into her husband at the Tower, shortly after Sepkis Prime.
Avela usually goes on missions with just Niav at first. They met Lwen, Rowan, and Icarus-7 on Venus going for the gatelord's eye.
They eventually lose Niilo so idefk who will be their sixth person.
And there's Niilo, Avela's husband. He's an awoken titan striker. No one likes him but the deal with him because of Avela.
Secretly Albert Wesker. (cause his va is wesker omg I can't see past that some times.)
He's dating Rowan because he thinks she's cute.
Icarus-7, and Exo Warlock. Sunsinger. He uses rebirth to try and reach out for past memories. Doesn't always work.
Rowan, another human hunter. Gunslinger because we're rolling with handcanons for fun. She's dating the robot.
Lwen has the schway greek/roman looking helmet. She thinks its bad ass that she looks like a warrior from ancient times.
There's Lwen. An awoken titan who is a defender. She's the most level headed of the group and currently dating Niav.
@Lavellann its hard! That's what I am doing for Icarus-7. Making a bunch of Greek myth references for him...
So Avela's fireteam. There's Niav who is a human hunter. Specializes in blade dancing. She's actually the leader of it. Super impulsive tho.
@Lavellann Aww rip Sierra-7.
Yes lets put Crota's sword in Avela's hands. THAT WILL GO WELL.
@Lavellann and Icarus-7 being like "don't worry. Our crazy warlock will hold the sword. I'm sure it'll go well."
I don't think I've talked about the rest of the fireteam before, thinking about it.
@Lavellann just all "Hey, Zo. Want to go to the Hellmouth? I'll give you cake."
@Lavellann Icarus-7 bribing her with cake.
Like Icarus-7 pls. Silly robot warlock.
Icarus-7 just being like "I know a guy" and ends up bringing @Lavellann's Zo over like "here's this boss hunter."
I have an idea for how Avela and her team recruit their sixth member for Crota's end. Because Niilo won't help them.
I also need to do all the stuff for Crota's Bane again so I can so things with my short stories.
Going to roll through the nightfall. Omnigul you're going down. Again. #destiny
@PTibz great!
GOING TO BE ON DESTINY TONIGHT. super determined to do stuff with my Titan and my Warlock.
@PTibz I haven't either! I'm going to download it after my move. Let me know how it is?
I'll take a picture of the after too. I love getting my hair done.
Feeling hella cute today and I'm getting my hair done! Next stop is taking my cat to the vet. 
@regaliis ahhhh thank you. I am like.. so happy people are enjoying my writing. It's been refreshing.
Hope @Bungie is okay with fan fiction. I'm like having a lot of fun with it. #destiny #writing
@regaliis Thank you! I am having a lot of fun with it. I enjoy writing for the Destiny universe.
"Crota. Son of Oryx. Youngest son. One of many. How many? I don't know." #Destiny 
I'm in tears. The place I live with my grandmother at is auctioning off a parking space. We got a letter. 
Foolish. Foolish, foolhardy, she was dreaming of possibilities upon outcomes that may never come. But it begged question #destiny
She taps her lips, staring, wondering what their next move was. Black Garden, Vault of Glass... The moon? But the reef... #destiny
"Often when we guess at others motives, we reveal only our own." What did she mean? What motive did she have? #destiny
I don't want go be me today. Can I be someone else? Waking up in tears really puts you down for the day.
I shouldn't want to do the VoG to try at getting Vex Mythoclast because of something stupid that might tie into Crota's End for my writing.
@Lavellann It's so neat! Holy shit. ...I am in love with the raid gear it's dreadful.
@Lavellann Omg what is that. It's so neat!
@veronicavarlow How adorable! Niney is precious.
It's not a bar room brawl, it's a bar room tidy, UNRUMBLE! #RedDwarf
Packing to move and I am now trying to figure out how to pack my tea cup signed by @emilieautumn 
@rbm276 Good luck!
@EpicNameBro exciting is a great word! Cause it could be a great exciting or a bad exciting.
Decided to try and show off Avela's wall in her lab of what it might look like. I'll do a more detailed one later. 
@EpicNameBro @madphilb oh my! Always exciting right?
Red Dwarf is leaving Netflix Feb 1st... Guess i'll have to marathon it. Oh smeg. #RedDwarf #TeamSmeg
The main character is the red head, by the way. Didn't know it was a boy till I started. 
I don't know what it's about. I just know my character's name is now Marcus (マーカス). Changed it from Lucas.
Picked up a new game! 禁忌のマグナ。This should be fun... #videogames #ビデオゲーム 
Getting coffee, asking myself if it's worth it. (Spoilers, it is.)
@LadieAuPair probably. I'll probably help.
also thanks @Lavellann for supporting my writing. I cannot thank you enough omg. I keep thinking about it all the time.
@LadieAuPair Right?! I think I might cry if that were to happen.
@Lavellann I'm glad! I felt that way too earlier today. It's nice to feel good about yourself, you know?
@Lavellann Any time. I have now liked said post. You look great by the by.
@Lavellann You have an amazing fashion taste and have a fab beard so... it should be at 99 notes (or 100 cause idk if i liked it yet)
You know, I am getting more comfortable with posting pictures of myself. I feel really good about this.
I don't know how it happened, but I found a custom painted My Little Pony in my washing machine...
@AyeItsPetrovic Up to you! I'm going to use it as a warm up tonight.
So I am in the habit of writing almost every night. Anything you guys want to see or have ideas for?
I love the awkward camera position and how super selfie that picture of myself is. It's amazing.
For the first time in years I feel great about my body. Still need to lose some weight but I feel good. 
@Lavellann Those are amazing screencaps.
"Corta, the son of Oryx." Avela mocks in the quiet of her lab, shaking her head. #Destiny 
At least the ambient dialogue is amazing. Using it for a story. I'm sorry ahead of time, I have sort of intense feelings about Eris.
Punching myself in the gut with feelings involving Eris because of some lore things I read online. Why wasn't this in the game?
@regaliis Exciting! I am hoping to get a group together to play through the Vault again, and then through Crota's End.
Ahh yes, no gaming tonight on the PS4. So do I boot up Steam, my Vita, or one of my 3DS systems... or turn my PS2 on?
Ir Yut the Deathsinger like that's rad.
@Lavellann I know but she's so cool sounding!
Ahh yes. I now have a reason to beg people to go through Crota's end with me. Ir Yut.
@Lavellann omg I couldn't ship my systems. I am driving those.
@Lavellann I used usps for that once. They lost two of my boxes. My hearing aid ended up in one and they just told me "oh well".
I shouldn't be awake. Part of me is like "I should write all of these things" and the other part is like "But you open..."
@AyeItsPetrovic BUT MY HELMET.
I have some really fun ideas though for some short stories dealing with Crota. Thanks @Lavellann for steaming!
ugh, I need to play through this raid just once. The stream glitched during Ir Yût.
Oh splendid. Over zealous knights!
@Lavellann Dude I see this happen to my poor friend all the time. He just wants Hawkmoon so bad.
@Lavellann I am excited to see this. I've never played through the whole raid before.
Our fight is a lie. It must be! We wait for the Traveler to speak -- to protect us from the Darkness. #Destiny 
At least, Avela believes Sparta is the right place. So much history lost with the Collapse. Niav only smiles, shaking her head. Awoken nerds
Lwen with the helmet in hand, gleeful. "Look Niav! I look like one of those Greek-Roman soldiers from history." "Like from Sparta." #Destiny
Lol all my friends are obsessed with Dragon Age and I'm like "Omg I finally have my titan helmet." I am SO writing for the wrong fandom.
@Lavellann Only if I drink something stronger then wine coolers.
@Lavellann @Livelonggetsome @elementzeros @VakarianX @R_I_P_BUBBY2 @piinkskittlez KICK ASS AND TAKE NAMES!
(That's not true, I do care about Destiny... because I want to run Crota's End and Vault of Glass again.)
I love my stupid titan helmet omg. that's all I wanted to do. don't even care about it destiny any more just needed the helmet.
I love this helmet though. #destiny 
Lol now to level up my Hunter omg.
Baby Titan no more! #destiny 
I keep getting exotic weapon bounties from Eris and I wonder if she's trying to tell me something.
@Lavellann that is super good advice. Going for pocket infinity then! I just have to finish this damn bounty for Thorn. Why so many exotics.
Oh this is tough. A new exotic Weapon Bounty... do I want Pocket Infinity or Super Good Advice? #Destiny
@veronicavarlow I am so excited. I just signed up with my new address too so I am prepared!
It's so surreal looking at my stuff and going "It's really happening. I'm actually moving". I'm not prepared. I'm a little scared.
@veronicavarlow I'm so excited!! I can't wait.
Amused at all the black birds at target. Just running errands and suddenly birds. 
@Lavellann CRYING you weren't kidding
@rbm276 dangerous  habit. I have a stack of games I should be playing but I end up back on Destiny.

Join Cryptarch as he goes for world first!

Watch live:



It's going to be legend…
Don't know if we can lose him. Icarus-8 might be different. Don't fly too close to the sun, sing songs of light. Rebirth he says. #destiny
Journal 334: I heard Icarus-7 muttering again of old wars. He doesn't remember but I know. He wants to do something might lose him. #Destiny
@rbm276 its the raid on Destiny for The Dark Below
Ugh I want to try Crota's End on hard more but I won't be on until later.
@Lavellann that was super rad. Not what I was expecting! Idk why because exploding heads is always fun
@Lavellann right?! Especially with Tesla involved. Super excited about it.
New @TheOrder1886 trailer and I am SO excited. #videogames
@Lavellann its the beard. It just draws people.
Ahh yes, music for the day. Some how it reminds me of Solas from Dragon Age... 
Damn, got nothing in the Crucible in both Skirmish OR Control. How awesome.
We just got wrecked in Destiny omg. Apparently a three person team of Warlocks is super dangerous.
@rbm276 Thank you so much though! I really appreciate the offer.
@rbm276 I'm not in the San Antonio area, unfortunately. I'd have to find a way to mysteriously leave work and teleport out.
Wish I was going to PAX South right now. @Bioware having a panel about getting into the industry would have been worth it.
@incatek I know I'm being super optimistic lol.
Still think Rahool needs an apprentice so we can read the cards in game.
So much information that is not in the game. I hope the House of Wolves dlc will give us something.
Toland's downward spiral of madness is so neat. I clearly need more information on him. At least I know Avela's madness is accurate.
Hello twitter I'm feeling creative today. How are you?
Crota would be his end, he was sure. Light fades eventually. Time was all he had. Into the Hellmouth, wicked laughter- songs of death.
The Darkness spoke, and he listened. Hesitant to understand, yearning for more- again and again how do you kill a god? #Destiny
Toland's descent into madness wasn't sudden. It took time. The longer he studied, the more he heard. Sounds in his head, like bells #destiny
@AyeItsPetrovic I NEED TO WRITE ABOUT PATCHES TOO, just because Patches is fab.
I forgot to post the short story where I mentioned @Lavellann's character briefly. I should do another one with them meeting or passing by.
She breaths deep, inhaling smoke as she reads. Reading was calming, educational, surprising. #Destiny 
Ugh, I wish I was so much better at Destiny so I can run Crota's End on hard mode without thinking I am going to fail it.
The Black Garden. 
@Lavellann omg
@Lavellann Everything about this clashes and I feel so bad for saying that.
@Lavellann IT IS.
@Lavellann I hated that armour so much. omg
But how? 
So close to level 20 I can taste it #destiny 
@Lavellann Ahhh that looks amazing!
TIME TO GET MY TITAN TO LEVEL TWENTY so I can wear my stupid helmet.
Woke up three times today wondering when I was actually going to get up. At least now I have coffee.
Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is on Netflix... oh my goodness.
@Lavellann well there goes my heart. thanks.
It might help if I post the story ON THE RIGHT BLOG. I'm super smart.
grafted: Freehold. Her friends stopped answering communications hours ago... #Destiny #Writing 
I just realised I'm not sure how exactly I want to end this story. This is a terrible thing.
I am legit crying over the meninist tee shirts. When I think it can't get any more ridiculous...
@Lavellann I hope so! I just know I'll need a lot of Dramamine to play it.
Mars should be exciting! We're on Mars! But I dread going to Mars in this game.
I just don't want to do the missions on Mars. That's where I'm at and I'm like "Ugh. Mars."
I'm five levels away from actually hitting level 20 with my titan and I am dreading doing this again with my hunter.
"Freehold isn't responding. I hope everyone is okay..." She had friends stationed there, fretting she won't make it in time to help...
I've been inspired by some of the information found in the cards online. Questions upon questions though.
House of Exile possibly house of wolves? Interesting...
I'd like to read Osiris' notes. Those would be interesting. Riddles upon riddles about the Hive, and he was starting into the Vex....
Reading some of the Grimoire cards on Bungie's site and Toland's just as crazy as Avela is... holy goodness boyo.
Like the Hive! A thrall can eventually become a Wizard! How cool is that?
I think my destiny writing has slowed down a bit, but I am determined to keep doing it. The art book has some neat things I want to explore.
Okay. Precollapse story, written. Next stop Freehold! I need to wander Mars for a bit so I guess it's a good thing I'm working on my Titan.
I mean really Eris. 
Brb going to steal Eris' ship because it's not even tied properly to the Tower...
@Lavellann you are really close to her face omg
Super nervous about the recent story, lol. It's a little silly to be so nervous omg.
"Dr. Riivas?"
He doesn't always bother her, cautious in his steps as he approaches her from behind. #Destiny 
@LadieAuPair @RAD_Studios @TheOrder1886 Oh no! Good thinking ahead of time, hahaha. Hopefully you keep warm after that!
@madphilb She came home! Haha.
@LadieAuPair @RAD_Studios @TheOrder1886 That looks like fun! Oh man hopefully you guys have towels...
you don't want to know how long I've been standing here on Venus in this mission waiting for my fiancee. It's a little ridiculous.
@TheOrder1886 is like my most anticipated game and it's so close I can almost taste it.
@Ru_Weerasuriya @RAD_Studios @PlayStation Congratulations! I cannot wait to play it.
I am just biding my time before I decide to summon the Vex. Certainly a good waste of time just hanging around then.
Ugh I hope this next story reads all right. I'll have my fiancee look it over before I post it.
Because this is encouraging! #destiny 
Nope I don't want to do this by myself. Lol going to stare at the console until my fiancee comes home and be like "yo come help me."
I just realised I am doing this mission on SUPER HARD. Now I'm like "do I want to do this by myself..."
Ahh yes, I love getting my butt kicked in Destiny...
Picked up Obsidian Mind and Ice Breaker today. So excite.
Pre-Collapse Avela, her escape, becoming Awoken.... her death and subsequent revival via Ghost down the line. #Destiny
Things I am going to start today: Chapter story with Avela pre-Collapse. Trying to flesh out what bare details we know about the era.
MARS IS THE WORST.
Mercury omg. How did I manage to type Mars.
The Collapse revealed Mars as a Vex machine, so when did we discover the Vault? How long have we known?
One of my favourite things is the archive on Venus. The Golden Age knew about the Vault of Glass. But how?
I forgot how much I adored the Awoken Queen and her brother.
Things I need to do today: Write.
Avela's hair when she escapes her mind. The Art of Destiny has some neat things in it. 
Panicking a little bit. Just got a call about transferring and it's happening really fast. I'm excited, and really scared.
Going down to see if I can get some money for some of my statues... Fingers crossed!
ぬ、私はとても緊張しています。
I just realised I didn't talk to Dorian when I reloaded my game. I need to fix this, Dorian is a treasure.
Arabella Adaar in judgement. #dragonage #dai 
First thought was "How do I get up there?" but this isn't Assassin's Creed. #dragonage #DAI 
Being an adult is difficult.
Decided to romance Josephine. She's super cute.
@Lavellann @alyloki She's gorgeous.
I am not going to play Destiny tomorrow. I am determined to play more Dragon Age. This is a good plan.
@madphilb RIGHT?
YES FUCKING FINALLY.
Niav! Avela's bff. #destiny 
I want to touch on that too when I write. Because from what it sounds like, Mercury was a Vex planet hundreds of years ago.
The ocean is in walking distance from where I live. It would be so easy.
I GOT TO THE END OF THE MATCH. -AGAIN- and I got kicked off. I am so tired of this.
I am going to go throw Destiny into the ocean.
@Lavellann RIGHT? It's absolutely amazing. I mean there's a nod about the Vex turning it into a Machine but thats it.
This is gorgeous #destiny 
I just want to do this exotic weapon bounty omg. Why do you hate me so much.
@BungieHelp what do these error codes even mean. I am so tired of being kicked out of every crucible match at the very end.
I just want to finish one crucible match, is that so hard to ask for?
Going to throw myself out a window. I was slaying when I got error code weasel. @Bungiehelp
If this keeps happening, I hope I can get through the Vault tonight... ugh. I kept dropping in and out of the Nightfall earlier.
Maybe this time I won't drop out of the match.
Damnit don't kick me off again @Bungie, I just want to shoot people....
This is upsetting, so I missed out on my experience for my exotic weapon bounty, AND I didn't get anything for the match.
I'm so angry. We were almost done with the match and I got kicked out by error code baboon.
NO I WAS DOING SO WELL IN THE CRUCIBLE FOR ONCE why did you disconnect me.
Let's try some crucible matches. This should be exciting!
Oh I had beer. Vault of Glass should be hilarious tonight...
Writing tonight. Curious about the strange coins? Might as well talk to the Agent of the Nine.
I could never afford something like this but its so entertaining. I'm like broke. It's amazing.
Technology today is astonishing! I'm getting a massage from car seat. My grandfather has a new Mercedes Benz. It's surreal.
@BungieHelp thanks for looking into it! Its driving me nuts.
@Lavellann haha thanks! I've been feeling down today so this helps. Trying to make a positive change in my outlook on how I look.
Feeling hella cute suddenly #selfie 
I just wanted @AtlusUSA's Persona Q 3ds XL. I might end up importing the Japanese system still so I can play Final Fantasy Explorers.
Then tomorrow, @NintendoofAmerica's new Nintendo Direct steam, probably crying over the fact I just finally upgrade to a 3DS XL.
Quick shower, dinner, then we'll try at something else. Either leveling up my titan or I might play some more Dragon Age.
OH NO. Friend wants the Monte Carlo, our other fireteam member gets it... Destiny really hates him.
@Lavellann I feel this way a lot....
@AyeItsPetrovic I'm getting back on right now. It's threw me out so I tested my connection.
I have done the thing. So excited @RE_Games #Biohazard #residentevil 
Aw damnit. The error codes are back...
@870Sports All the strikes are going to be on the Xbox in like a year or so.
@BrightHouseCare So far so good, but we'll see! I'll let you know if the connection errors start up again.
@870Sports I have it on the One, but I haven't been on that often. My fiancee finally got a PS4 so I've been playing there, haha.
@870Sports I am! I just managed it because my connection the servers stabilized enough for me to complete it.
@BrightHouseCare I'm going to attempt to restart the modem and shut down the system in a moment. See if that clears the issue.
@BrightHouseCare I'm on the PS4.
Damnit! I just want to complete the nightfall. Is that so wrong?
@BrightHouseCare I'm connected to the internet, yes. I've tested the network connections a few times and it tells me I'm fine.
Okay now I am starting to get really frustrated. Either it's @Brighthouse or @Bungie's servers. I keep getting thrown out of Destiny.
Oh goody! Started the Nightfall and already dead. How?
"The one draw back is that the abbreviation is CLITORIS." #RedDwarf has been my life the last night.
The Committee for the Liberation and Integration of Terrifying Organisms and their Rehabilitation Into Society #Smeghead (Favoutie line)
Oh no tumblr is down. I guess the Xur story will have to wait for now. Sup twitter?
My fiancee is the best. #Destinywhileidestiny 
grafted: Move faster, she tells her feet. Stay alert. Blink, blink, blink, pull the trigger - #Destiny 
I might do a mars story. Avela hates Mars so much... #destinywriting
@JessicaMerizan it sounds like exactly what I am passionate about either writing or community coordinating. I'm just so nervous.
@JessicaMerizan and going back to school.
@JessicaMerizan brushing up my résumé and cover letter to try and promote myself for the gaming industry.
I am always open for writing ideas too. I'm really having fun with expanding the #Destiny universe.
I have so many ideas for my next story involving Xur, Eris, and the Exo Stranger.
I had this epiphany that I never posted my Vault of Glass story on my nee writing blog. I'll fix that when I get home.
Though I'm kind of nervous to write about Avela with her husband. Its not healthy.
Really happy with my writing lately so there is tht.
Ahh yes. That time of day where I stare in wonder about what I am doing with my life.
@Lavellann @alyloki @elementzeros omg her hair. it's super cute and so 80s.
Whispers into the wind "I know what you are." insert vex screeching.
I realise that saying Atheon's name three times isn't as amazing as saying Beetlejuice.
"Atheon, Atheon... Atheon." #Destiny 
I was going to write a thing about Xur but then my hand slipped and oops time to write about the Vex.
@870Sports I KNOW RIGHT?! Atheon, Atheos, Atheist, does he really believe in the Vex Koolaid or is he actually... A GOOD GUY?!
I mean it's crazy walking into the Black Garden and seeing these Vex worshiping a God. They've been there for so long moss started growing.
Like how the vex are said to have one mind but actually had different factions and beliefs.
Seriously. The Vex are probably have some of the most interesting information and -none of it is in the game-.
@_punisher_X I am!
I am having intense feelings about the Vex right now, it's awful.
I'm going to spend my day crying over music.
I feel great about it.
I cannot thank everyone enough for supporting my writing lately. Thank you for the encouragement.
@Lavellann IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SMALL WHITE ORB and that is why i ask my fiancee to double check my writing omg.
I have this crazy theory that the Speaker is collecting Motes of Light because he thinks they can be used to communicate with the Traveler.
@Lavellann I have always wanted to ask but have been afraid to.
@Lavellann NONE PIZZA LEFT BEEF
Oh the next episode of AVELA IS CONFUSED BY EVERYTHING because she's crazy: XUR. THE AGENT OF THE NINE.
She stopped to speak to Kadi 55-30 recently. She ordered something, but long forgotten, how long ago? #Destiny 
Just spelled typos wrong. What is my life? #writing
OH GOODNESS MY TYPOES TODAY. "The Traveller Hands." and "A small what orb." What is this madness? #writing
@regaliis AN EYE FOR AN EYE. THEY TOOK MY EYES. and you're starting to worry me there Eris.
I hear her voice in my head and I'm like 'ERIS PLS"
@regaliis CROTA. SON OF ORYX.
It's like. I have other games. I can finish Dragon Age. I could start The Wolf Among Us, or The Evil Within... .but no. Destiny.
I have a stack of games I need to play but all I end up doing is playing Destiny. What has my life become?
@Lavellann Because they know they can get away with it.People will buy mediocre games and not do a thing about it - it's easier to bitch.
Ahh yes. Writing. I am so happy to be writing again.
That moment when you look cute as hell in an outfit and then spill coffee on yourself...
That and I have intense feelings over @bastilledan it's always exciting. 

@Lavellann oh goodness you're a sweetheart. You don't have to do that. &lt;3
My cat is looking pretty innocent for someone who likes sleeping on my face... 
Great. Soul crushing feeling like I'll never be good enough. Perfect timing.
@Lavellann omg that is the most amazing screen cap. Like literally seconds before you punch him in the face.
@Lavellann it's like everyone is getting a blow job
I AM CALLING SHENANIGANS ON BRAZIL NUTS. Why are you so difficult to crack?
Like bro, you were surrounded. You really want us to charge in there and die too when you keep CHARGING IN AND DYING?
LOL WOW WHAT AN ASSHOLE. Some asshole left us during the strike because we didn't revive him quick enough.
Ahh yes. Home from work.
What is really best to fight the "Darkness"? What is the Light? #Destinywriting
The mind is a fickle thing, changing ideas on a whim. We perceive good and evil as black and white but does the Speaker really know...
The void screams promises of power, loud, volatile but one must not listen. The mind can only handle so much. #Destinywriting
Cracking nuts is not my specialty. 
They call it "void walking" but none have unlocked true potential. Most sing praise to the sun as rebirth is preferred. #destinywriting
She walks the line between Time and Space because she finds it objective. It's so easy to bend time to ones will... #Destinywriting
I have intense feelings over my new found writing groove.
Might run Crota's end tonight then start writing.
@Lavellann omg I'm dying right now. What the hell.
I'm horribly attracted to the vocalist of @ArcticMonkeys.
I'm never getting to the tower. I'm just stuck in orbit waiting to connect to the Destiny servers...
WHY. @DestinyTheGame I keep getting kicked out and it makes me sad. I just want to punch the nightfall boss in the face.
@bastilledan @MiddletonRiddle @Woodythedrum @emilysafarie did you hum the theme while you were there?
I keep getting kicked out of the game, it's driving me crazy.
DAMNIT I JUST WANT TO PUNCH THIS GUY IN THE FACE #DestinyNightfall
I am pretty proud of myself for getting my writing blog set up. Going to write something to celebrate I think.
Thank you for bearing with me while I got that situated! I hope you enjoy the stories if you decided to read them. #HiresydneyforBungie2015
grafted: Twitter Story 2. #Destiny. 
grafted: He wonders what would his room be like if he remembered times before. #Destiny 
grafted: "Where did you get that?"
"I went to the Moon. I wanted to see this bug up close. #Destiny 
grafted: They say Toland was exiled but from what she found, Toland perished attempting to slay Crota. #Destiny 
grafted: Time. Time. Time. Time.
Over and over again, the walls covered in bright blue ink #Destiny 
grafted: She remembers red. When she tries to explain it, it comes out disjointed, #destiny 
grafted: Twitter story.#Destiny #DestinytheGame. 
grafted: She stands in awe. The Fallen looked relaxed, at ease, standing guard as their queen lounged #Destiny 
Linking my twitter to the writing tumblr. So be prepared for a few links as I reblog some of my stuff onto it.
@Lavellann I am getting it set up. I'll be putting all of my #Destiny stories there and I might be attempting a multichapter story.
Oh hey! @Lavellann I got the name finally. Apparently it's literally a full 24 hours from the time it's relinquished.
@Lavellann I might have to. it's hella cute.
@Lavellann ISN'T IT!? I just have no idea when I'll wear it.
Actually feeling cute in a dress even though I have no idea when I'll wear it. Its a bad photo, haha. 
@madphilb it'll be perfect! Wearing my mask again. My cough came back with a vengeance. 
Start at the end of the Collapse and go through current time. #Destiny
I have to say I'm really proud of myself for writing more. I might actually sit down to write a chapter story for #Destinythegame
All right. Mood tanked. Lets do this. Fake smile, go!
@Imaginedragons are we ever ready? I hope so.
@emedeme91 OMG EME. crying but no, because of  this. (Also if you want to talk about it, I'm here. 8( Drop kick them) 
@emedeme91 How are you? I thought of you the other day actually while I was cleaning my room.
@emedeme91 idk either I just wanted to say hi.
@emedeme91 oh hi there.
why is the url still taken I am so confused.
@Lavellann Maybe. I'm going to try again after midnight.
@Lavellann No. 8( Still telling me it's taken by someone else.
Apparently we're watching Mean Girls because I've never seen it.
@Lavellann Which is REALLY great when I keep getting kicked out of Destiny. It's amazing. But one day we shall do vault together.
@Lavellann Ahh maybe not! Damn, I'll let you know. My fiancee just got a call about not having to go to school tomorrow.
@Lavellann I'm game if my other team doesn't get together.
Working on a story about the Exo, specifically my warlock Icarus-7, reflecting on his name.
Once I figure out why Tumblr won't let me use the name I want, I will be reblogging all of the @DestinyTheGame stories I've written.
"The Hive have fireflies." #Writing
I am amused at writing twitter stories. The character limit makes it challenging. #writing
We're all just water racing down the drain... #ErisMorn
Some things are better left to the dark below. Crawling, under the surface, they scatter when the light shines. She hopes you will listen.
Fury, righteous rage as she demands you take him down. As it is no kind task to remove a Hive God from their ranks. #ErisMorn
She grits her teeth, seething. "Crota, Son of Oryx," she speaks as if Oryx is a name you should cling to -as she does for Crota. #ErisMorn
It must boil her skin to know Crota still lives. She says his name with such vile passion, obsession wasn't suiting her well. #ErisMorn
Tumblr why. They do not have the url any more. Why can't I have it.
I wonder how long it's going to do this.
"SOMEONE HAS ALREADY CLAIMED THE USERNAME" but that's a lie. Because I know it's a lie. Tumblr pls.
@Lavellann Destiny writing sideblog, here I come! ... I'll just randomly drop it into @Bungie's email and whisper softly "hire me". haha
@Lavellann I'll keep trying in the mean time. I should be able to make it a side blog right?
@Lavellann It's telling me it's claimed by another user...
@Lavellann YES omg. I'm there.
@Lavellann Ready! Which url is it?
@Lavellann Take your time!
@Lavellann I'm actually online right now!
@Lavellann omg would you really? you're super nice.
Just realised all the #Destiny related URLs on tumblr are like taken right now. Going to make a writing archive there.
#HireSydneytoworkatBungie
I've become more passionate about my writing lately, I want to jump back into the fray. I just want to prove I have what it takes.
So now I have to change it. I am determined to be qualified for the job I want.
I am crying over the idea of the opportunity of working as a story teller for @Bungie and I'm not qualified. What is life.
What I wouldn't give to be in that position.
@Bungie is looking for a writer and I might cry.
@regaliis Have him invite me in! I'll be more then happy to help them with the Vault.
@regaliis I keep getting kicked out of Destiny so I am super sorry if I missed anything. Does he have fire team?
CROTA. SON OF ORYX. Each time she says those words a little of part of her dies.
All I ant to do is play Destiny. Why do I keep getting kicked off?
OKAY ROUND TWO WITH TRYING TO LEVEL UP THE TITAN. Let's do this, destiny.
Also my cat is sleeping on me, so not moving is certainly preferable.
Decided I didn't want to bathe, so Jimmy Johns it is.
I've been sitting here for like an hour debating on showering to get food staring at this error message in Destiny. I should probably eat.
On today's episode of attempting to play Destiny. How many times will I get kicked out of the game world? #curseyouerrorcodeweasel
"From the North American Empire just before the Collapse. You can tell by the eagles."Favourite random line of dialogue.Thanks @TheCryptarch
Going to slay myself with feelings over fictional robots. #Destinythegame
Determined: Write a small story a day. Doesn't have to be huge, but if I get back into the habit of writing I can do more.
@Shorester it's not as exciting as the two months of nothing. Yet.
yay psn outages.
The raid did not go as planned. How exciting.
And apparently I can't randomly invite someone to be like "YO HELP MAYBE?" PSN messed up the friends thing.
awesome that someone just randomly jumped out. It's like SURPRISE YOU'RE DOWN TO FIVE. I love surprises.
@Lavellann omg
@incatek AH sorry! Maybe next time. We started the weekly strike so that's been exciting.
@incatek Vault of Glass...we're going to try running it tonight IF MY DAMN CONNECTION WOULD BE STABLE. I keep getting kicked.
Or we're not running through VoG because we need three people. That's cool for now.
Running through VoG again, and then I'll have to find people to do Crota's end because SOMEONE DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME (cough @AyeItsPetrovic)
HELLO TWITTER my only friend.
I mean I keep focusing on the VoG so I should do something else lol.
I'm at work so I'll be more then happy to read about them to keep me entertained. #writing
Writing tonight. Probably for #Destiny. If you have any ideas shoot them my way!
@Lavellann you too when you get back to it!
All right. Lets see if I can sleep.
@Lavellann they've gone full furry.
dying over my twitter feed. sometimes it pays to not sleep.
@Lavellann you and me both.
@Lavellann perhaps it's time to delete the sonic folder.
@Lavellann watching this both magnificent and terrifying. I love it.
@Lavellann EVEN MORE WEIRD. so enjoy not being able to see at night if you ever want a glass of water. I'd be so confused all the time.
@Lavellann it's like a big fuck you to doing things. SURPISE NOW YOU CAN'T SEE WITH YOUR SPECIAL EYES! enjoy stumbling out to the morning
@Lavellann that must be them most surreal thing in the world.
@Lavellann I keep posting Destiny stories to tumblr. It's kind of fun.
@Lavellann I wrote another Vault story on the lead up to why they all end up in the vog. so Crota's end should be interesting!
i need to run crota's end so i can write about that and it's super dumb.
clearly i am in the wrong fandom. writing for a game that has little story.
I follow so many amazing writers on my tumblr it's like why do i bother.
one minute I feel great, the other minute I have this fear that it's never going to be good enough.
I should just write more ridiculous destiny things and hope that they're okay haha.
why am i awake.
@Lavellann I'd suggest tea but that would require moving wouldn't it?
I am feeling really good about this short story now. I feel like I can show off my work and be like "Yes I wrote this. And it is decent."
@Lavellann drop kick them. I mean not the baby, cause that would cause more crying...
Might start a writing tag for it just called #Destinywriting or bring back the #Puncheverythingsaga tag as it's about my Warlock.
I keep writing short stories for @DestinyTheGame and i think it's become a dangerous habit.
@regaliis I'm having some connection issues to the Destiny servers tonight, so it might be rough getting online
