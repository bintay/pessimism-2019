THIS SHOW IS REAL it's called "trollj√§garna" which is translated to "the troll hunters" and it's hilarious and terrifying at the same time
this episode ended with them fining him 5000 SEK to be paid to the victim.
Watching them try to explain how it's not them is the best entertainment I've ever seen.
(cont) they've sent to people, since its actually illegal.
Oh my godd there is a new Swedish reality TV show where they are tracking down internet trolls and confronting them about the death threats

How can you move faster than possible...fight longer than possible...without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.
You do not fear death. You think this makes you strong. It makes you weak.
No, I'm not afraid. I'm angry.
Man that sucks.

It‚Äôs one of my theories that when people give you advice, they‚Äôre really just talking to themselves in the past.
I haven't always made the right decisions. And when I realize that I have made the wrong ones...I'm too far gone to get myself out.
It's just that I keep blaming my trust issues on everyone else. And the truth is, the person I don't trust is myself.
Trust is for the weak.
Sometimes, to survive, you have to give up the things that you cared about...and just give in to your fate.

Welcome back!!!!! :)
Yeah, but sooner or later, you have to trust someone with what's in your heart. Otherwise you're gonna end up going through life alone.
...and sometimes you have to, even if that's not what you want.
People have a lot of different sides. And sometimes they keep those sides hidden, even from the ones that they love.
@milabzkleer haha. Lol I just miss you =) and just so you know, I haven't forgotten you. Never in a million years
Clark Kent, why do you have to be so cute @tomwelling seriously, why.
I miss you :( and sorry for everything @milabzkleer
Sometimes we think we want the truth until we actually get it. If you want me to be honest with you, I will, but you're not gonna like it.
If you have something to say about me, say it to my face. Cause I've got a pet peeve about people talking behind my back.
There's a darkness in me that I can't always control. I'm starting to think that's my curse...why every relationship I have ends badly.

A person isn't who they are during the last conversation you had with them. They're who they've been throughout the whole relationship.
I wanna believe that someone can change, but... But I'm starting to lose faith.
I've always thought that my life is so mapped out for me...but, you know, maybe we have more control over the future than we think.
Maybe it's time to stop being so afraid.
It made me realize how many decisions I make...because I'm scared of how things will end up.
I just figured it's better to be alone, even if people think I'm snob
I‚Äôm always so afraid that if I get too close to people they'll realize that I'm a freak.
sometimes keeping a secret hurts more than it helps.
Not really a big fan of Superman movies but god, this Superman TV series is way beyond good! In fact,‚Ä¶ 
I'm just beginning to wonder who I let into my life.
Maybe you have to be grateful for the time that you spend together...and stop holding on to what could've been.

As badly as I want the truth, I'm afraid I won't like what I find.
Then you might miss out on something that could be pretty amazing.
If you want to get close to someone, you have to take that risk. What if the risk is too big to take?
If you really like someone, you accept every part of them. But you can't do that until they're willing to share every part with you.

Does anybody else think tired and sleepy mean two totally different things?
I'm very picky with whom I give my energy to. I prefer to reserve my time, intensity and spirit exclusively to those who reflect sincerity.
How I get there doesn't matter, as long as everybody plays their part.
Tje by-product of having well-drawn character is they may surprise you. Buy t I know something they don't know. The ending.
What writer doesn't love a good twist? My job is to set up interesting characters and see where they lead me.

Dean's shower scene #MetaFiction
Or you? Tonight, I thought I would tell you a little story...and let you decide.
What makes a story works? Is it the plot, the characters, the text? The subtext? Wmand who gives a story meaning? Is it the writer?
and he explained that he was still learning english before he touched the hat again and said ‚Äúpom-pom" in a fascinated voice =)
and a few seconds later he picked the hat out of the bag and said ‚Äúyou called this a pom-pom?‚Äù and i said yes, hat‚Äôs what i call them,
I was ringing up a winter hat for a man the other day and i said ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs so cute! i love the pom-pom on the top.‚Äùand he smiled and agreed,
Why are girls afraid of wearing heels and being taller than guys? No, you wear those heels that you love &amp; pat his head like he's your son.
I'll give you this much: You are certainly williN to do the sacrificing... as long as you're not the one being hurt.
But you, you didn't want to be alone. And that's what all this boils down to. You can't stand the thought of being alone.
Okay. Just once be honest with me. You didn't save me for me. You did it for you.
Please tell me: what is the upside of me being alive?
you thinknwhat you're doing is worth it because you've convinced  you're doing more good than bad. But you're not.
And that... is the problem. You think you're my savior, my hero. You swoop in and even when you mess up,
I may not think things all the way through. Okay, but what I do, I do because it's the right thing. I'd do it again.
There are things you can forgive, and there are things you can't. So, which one is this? That's something you got to figure out for yourself
like this is just something I could get past.
I just got punched right in the feels. None of it was real. He was just pretending and now he wants me to pretend,

Don't let that go. Okay? You'll never forgive yourself. Besides, somebody's gotta live to tell this damn story someday.
some more than others. But if it works, it works. You got something here.
Well, hey, you said it. You know, who cares where happiness comes from? Look, we're all a little weird, we're all a little wacky,
@yllahtuts I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl...some other girl"
Maybe Winchesters can too.
Becuse the ends always justified the means. But what I went though... Well that PB and J taught me that angels can change so, who knows?
You know, the old me...I would've have just kept going. I would've jammed that needle in deeper until you died,
And I know what it means to feel sorry. I am sorry.
The only person who has screwed things up more consistently than you...is me. And now I knoe what that guilt feels like.
No, I...I taste every molecule. It's overwhelming. It's disgusting. I miss you, PB and J.
So, what? Now you can't taste PB and J?
But... I enjoyed the taste of food, particularly peanut butter with grape jelly, not jam. Jam I found unsettling.
Yeah, a lot of human things are pretty annoying.
When I was human, you know, I had to eat constantly. It was kind of annoying.

"...if there is something wrong, it's not your fault. We'll deal with it. But you got to have a little faith."
Or this is...just the way I am.
when maybe it's just me. I'm a mess, you know it. And sometimes, I feel like, maybe I'm never gonna actually be all right.
I don't know. Why does it have to be something else? It's always something else. We're always scraping to find some other explanation,
What if there is something wrong with me? Something really wrong? It's more than that. I mean, Vesta said I wad practically dead inside.

I think part of the reason we we hold on to something so tight is because we fear something great won't happen twice.
You are so nice, it's annoying.
I hate &amp; love Collin at the same time. Is that normal?
No expectations please.
#ParksAndRec's Rashida Jones is a co-writer for the film! 
Why is it seems so easy for "this" TV Show to prompt people (most people, I guess)that it is not that hard to cheat on your partner?just why
First, I felt bad for Jake, because T's treating him like a B. just to impress somebody. 2nd, for Matty, because Jenna's cheating on him...
I gotta say, Collin is way too hot than Matty. Collin is more Manly, yes. But Jenna, what you did was a very dick move... #AWKWARDS3
The best version of myself was just as boring as the regular version.

It's funny, I was... I was done for too. The weight of all my mistakes. All those lives and souls lost. I couldn't take it either.
I did at first. But that was a projection of yours, I think. Sort of an aftertaste. Now I more see... Well, everything.
What about me? You're worried about the burden I lifted from you.
You seem troubled. Of course, that's a primary aspect of your personality, so I sometimes ignore it.

Look man, I get it. You meet a girl, you feel that spark. There's nothing better. But this freak?
Look, you sitting here wringing your hands ain't gonna do nothing. Maybe he'll surprise you.

You're in the middle of a psychotic break.
What happens when u let your bully buddy borrow your phone because she said she need to Google something? @yllahtuts 
Didn't I tell you to turn back, that you wouldn't like what you found?
Honestly? I was having second thoughts. About whether to help you. I was thinking maybe I should rip out your sticky bits instead.

Despite all our differences I think we can all agree on one thing
Robin Williams was a fcking gift to humanity.
Give yourself permission to immediately walk away from anything that gives you bad vibes. There is no need to explain or make sense of it.
and i knew it was bad when i woke up in the mornings and the only thing i looked forward to was going back to bed.
Would you believe in what you believe in if you were the only one who believed it?
When you go around trying to be like somebody else, not only does it demean you; it steals your uniqueness.
God doesn't want a bunch of clones. You were created to be you. You were not created to mimic somebody else.

But then I remember that the world‚Äôs dying bloody, so drink?

Even worse, like I‚Äôm an idiot. Like I don't know the difference between right and wrong.
Wanna know why I‚Äôve been lying to you? Because of crap like this. The way you talk to me. The way you look at me like I‚Äôm a freak.
But it's pure, base instinct. Everything in nature‚Äôs gotta eat. You think he can stop himself because he's nice?
So somebody slaps a big juicy sirloin in front of you, you walking away?   That's what we are to him now. Meat on legs.
You ever been really hungry? I mean, haven't-eaten-in-days hungry? Right, then.
He's sweet. Kind. Even after the war, everything he still believes in happily-ever-after, you know? He's everything a hunter isn't.

Look, pal, I‚Äôm not buying what you're selling. So who are you, really?
And what visage are you in now, huh? What, Holy tax accountant?
That was my mistake. Certain people, special people, can perceive my true visage. I thought you would be one of them. I was wrong.
You mean the gas station and the motel? That was you talking? Buddy, next time, lower the volume.
I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be overwhelming to humans. And so can my real voice, but you already knew that.

The battle is in your mind. If you are defeated in your mind, you've already lost the battle.

Happy Birthday @OsricChau <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è Hoping to see you again this coming season! We miss youuuuu x
I just wanna be left alone. I just wanna dream.
I can dream again. You know what that's like, not to be able to dream? You never rest, not really. It's like being awake for 15 years.
I know how dead you are inside. How worthless you feel. I know how you look into a mirror and hate what you see.
Joke all you want, smart-ass. But you can‚Äôt lie to me. I know the truth.
I get it. I'm my own worst nightmare, that it? Huh? Kind of like the Superman III junkyard scene? A little mano y mano w myself?
I mean, how can you care so little about yourself? What's wrong with you?
But really, the thing is, no one can save you. I mean, no one can save you because you don't wanna be saved.
I mean, where you're going...what you're gonna become. I can't stop it. I'm starting to think maybe even Ruby can't stop it.
Actually, they got that pretty. Except for all the custom leather.
No, I saw hellraiser. I get the gist.
it's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor. There's a real fire in the pit agonies you cant imagine.
But you make me an offer, and I think you'll find me highly cooperative.
You and I don't know each other very well. So let me tell you a little something about me. I don't respond well to threaths.
Mm. I've heard something about that. From my good friend, the easter bunny. Who'd heard it from the tooth fairy.
Good times

oh my god. This 3 am random thoughts is killing meh<FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
I notice when things change, and when it‚Äôs no longer the same. I notice every single little detail. I just don‚Äôt say anything.
I notice when the way someone talks to me starts changing. I notice the little things that people do, and the little things they used to do.
I notice everything. And by everything, I literally mean everything. I notice when someone stops hitting me up like they used to.
they barely recall because behind all of those rambles there are real issues that you can only try to address when you listen. Just listen.
Therefore, you should let them ramble about little things such as a broken nail, a C on a test, a book with broken binding or a nightmare
No matter the specifics of those dilemmas, people won‚Äôt always tell you everything because they fear being judged.
Everyone faces struggles in their lives.

Now, this Ruby girl knows more than we will ever find out on our own. Now, yes, it's a risk, I know that, but we need to take it.
I mean, we're at war, right? We don't know jack about the enemy. We don't know where they are, what they're doing, what they want.
Come on, have a heart, huh? It's my dying wish. As many as I can squeeze out.
You're unbelievable. Very true.
Eh. Well, whatever. You're alive, I feel good for the first time in a long time. I got a year to live, I'd like to make the most of it.
Yeah, you're right, it was selfish, but I'm okay with that. After everything I've done, I think I'm entitled.
You were twisted and broken and now you go and do the same thing. To me. What ypu did was selfish.
I've been busting my ass trying to keep you alive. And you act like you couldn't care less. You got some kind of death wish or something?
You know what? I've had it. I've been bending over backwards trying to be nice to you and I don't care anymore.
