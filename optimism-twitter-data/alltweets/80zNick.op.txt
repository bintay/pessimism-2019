Wow... i actually don't close tonight.  #GoFigure
Good morning Suzie. I hope you have a great start to your day and a really good day overall.  I just want you to be happy :-)
#ILoveYouSuzie
How i look at Suzie every day since i first got to know her
#Suzie 
Every second of every day
You are my heaven.  You are my everything. You should be here next to me right now. I miss our Saturday mornings. I miss you.
#IMissSuzie
#Suzie
I just woke from a horrible nightmare.  I hate this so much.  I always called you when i had a nightmare.  Now i just lay here.  #IMissSuzie
I hope wherever you are and whatever you're doing are are having a great night.  Sleep well and sweet dreams. I love you Suzie. Goodnight<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
Lol
I want to still be good enough for Suzie
I want her so bad. I wish she'd try to look past our history and see things can and WILL be different.  I'm not giving up #ILoveSuzie 
#Hope
I love her!  I just completely love her! #ILoveSuzie
I hope you have a great day today Suzie :-)
#YouAreMyHeaven
I don't want to be a screwup anymore.  I'm not sure what i even did wrong tonight.  #TryingToGiveHerSpace
I've ever had to do. I still continue to strive to be a better person for me,  you and us.  I love you Suzie (3/3)
everything i am and i will make you first and will be there for you whenever you need me. Being apart from you is the hardest thing (2/3)
I don't want to make any more dumb discussions.  I'm not perfect by any means.  Who i am is someone who will love you with (1/3)
I hope you sleep well and have sweet dreams Suzie. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get to hear from you in the morning. Goodnight Suzie I love you!
Staying hopeful and positive that things will continue to get better between us no matter what. I know it will take time and patience.
The only thing that would make me happier and just make my night would be a goodnight call from Suzie. #SheMakesMeSmile
#LOVE
Alright... the sound of rain falling, ice cream and the cockamouse episode. Plus I'm in love #Happy #Relaxed
I'm very much looking forward to staying up and listening to the incoming storm.  Rain, thunder, lightning. I wish it was her #IMissSuzie
I'm getting better at just letting things go and not letting them drive me crazy. This evening was a test of that. Staying true and positive
Suzie still gives me butterflies<BLACK HEART SUIT>
I have so much to show you Suzie. I can't wait for you to give me the chance. June 1st seems so painfully far away #NickAndSuzie
#BELIEVE
NEVER! 
#Suzie 
I promise every day for the rest of my life if Suzie will let me
I will show Suzie

I hope Suzie and Princess Lily are having a great night together.  That would make me so happy. I wish i could be part if it. I love you two
I also got see and talk to Princess Lily.  I was so happy i had some tears. She's so amazing and I love her so much. I didn't want her to go
and think about how much i love her. Plus she looked BEAUTIFUL<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT> (2/2)
Today was my first day seeing her in exactly 1 week.  It felt good.  I felt happy.  Every time i saw her i couldn't help but smile (1/2)

Day 2 of being back.  She called me this morning #BestWayToWakeUp. I'm using that as my motivation to have a great morning and a great day
I miss you Suzie :-(
But i hope you're sleeping well :-)
It still kills me to not call you and tell you goodnight.  But i know we're doing good right now and i don't want to ruin that #ILoveSuzie
I would do ANYTHING! 
probably had a long night. Plus this morning was so nice. I shouldn't be greedy. I love you Suzie.  Goodnight<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT> (3/3)

I hope you're having a great evening with Princess Lily Suzie. I miss you and i love you. Hoping to talk to you later tonight #ILoveSuzie
Other than my headache I'm feeling good.  Feeling positive.  Feeling happy.  Might be going to dinner with my niece and fan instead. :-)
Finally out of work and getting a BAD headache.  Was hoping to do laundry but seems as plans are changing.  Stupid headache. Lol
Almost off of work then to my mom's house. Trying to be a more helpful son.  :-)

Suzie,
    I hope you had a great day today and a happy day.  I love you with all my heart.  Sleep well and sweet dreams. I miss you
First day in 5 days i didn't have a panic attack.  I didn't even vomit once. I even got to hear her voice.  I'd say today was a win.
Lol.  Suzie and I 100%
Every minute of every day Suzie! 
Never! 
THIS is my reason for my LOA #TryingToGiveHerSpace 
I will fight I'm not giving up.  #IBelieve
My actions WILL change
I'll always love Suzie!
I truly did and will.  Everyone looked at us in awe. She loved me and I LOVE her.  #NickAndSuzie 
Suzie...
Suzie will ALWAYS come first
I'm trying.  God knows i am
I'll wait as long as it takes for Suzie. I just simply love her with EVERYTHING i have.

Why can't Suzie just be here in my arms? We would make EVERYTHING so much better and magical. 
#TrueLove
#ILoveSuzie
I wish that was what you're doing
... Nor could I
After a full day with my dad. I realized just how much of a HUGE part of my everyday life Suzie is. I would never want to replace her. <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
Suzie was my mine &amp; OMG YES! 
I always knew that was my biggest fear.  I was right. #SuziePleaseComeBack
I hope so.  Theres only one person i want to come to me and stay #ILoveSuzie 
I miss you so much Suzie.  I feel completely lost without you. I love you!  You're my Minnie and I'm YOUR Mickey. #SimplyMeantToBe
I hope whatever Suzie is doing and wherever she is she's smiling and having a good day.  Her happiness means EVERYTHING to me. #ILoveSuzie
We're working on it.  I hope 
And I'm waiting for Suzie :-)<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
I hope so
IDK. It makes me feel pretty pathetic :-/
I'm actually have a good day so far. I got a phone call this morning that made me smile #ILoveSuzie
Then a movie with dad.
Next dinner at 4
It Was my first movie with him since MIB2. It was pretty much my first time ACTUALLY watching Avengers: Age Of Ultron.  It Was AWESOME!!
Just got back from taking my dad to see Avengers2. He really liked it.  It Was his First #IMAX movie. He almost never goes to the movies :-)
#Suzie
I hope wherever Suzie is today and whatever she does i hope she's happy and smiling. She just naturally glows. I love her. 
#ILoveSuzie
Besides vomiting is gross.
Today's goal is to not have a panic attack i almost accomplished it yesterday. I've been having them for 4 straight days now. I need to stop
Day 4 of my LOA... I'm going to take my dad to see his first ever 3D IMAX move in 2 hours Avengers: Age of Ultron @AMCTheatres Del Amo 18
Good morning Suzie.  I hope you slept well and have a wonderful day.  May the 4th be with you! (Pew... pew...) Lol.  I love you Suzie <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
Wherever you are Suzie whatever you're doing please remember that I love you I miss you and I need you. Goodnight my everything. #ILoveSuzie
This is EVERYTHING i want to be for Suzuki Elizabeth Lopez. And nobody else<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
I just want to be Suzie's and Suzie be mine. That's my happily ever after <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
I had that. I want it back more than you could believe
I told Suzie every day
THIS was Suzie. She was completely unexpected and completely took my breath away
Not everyone sees me that way.  I feel like being so sensitive is a curse. It just seems to make (cont) 
to be haunted by someone
that is still alive.”
Day 3 of my LOA. Morning Started out positive i even heard her voice.  Afternoon tried to stay positive.  Now I kinda wanna cry. #INeedSuzie
This was my favorite place to bring Suzie. It just doesn't feel right without her.  #IMissSuzie 
My first kiss with Suzie truly was. So was EVERY single kiss thereafter
But not every girl wants :-(
I wish Suzie knew this like i do.  We wouldn't need space or time apart
She blocked me... She said she wouldn't... then she did...
 
#DeepBreath
I'm still that same guy.  I would spend the rest of my life surprising her and making her smile if (cont) 
#Suzie
Wow 
I'll always be hers #ILoveSuzie 
I wonder this every moment we're apart
Hopefully it won't take that long.  But Suzie's with the wait. 
All i needed was Suzie. I loved her soul i love HER! 
We WILL find a way.  I believe to my very core and soul
#BELIEVE 
#NickAndSuzie
#Forever
I was always so proud to have Suzie.  I need that back #ILoveSuzie 
THAT is the dream! :-)
I used to mean something to Suzie
Which is why i have EVERYTHING to lose with Suzie
If We get back together we're napping every morning possible. #HerHouse
This should be us. 
#NickAndSuzie 
Love and magical! (3/3)
for her
That breaks my heart to know, see and feel that. This is NOT who we are. No part of our relationship was BAD. It was True (2/3)
I so desperately want her to understand that this time off I'm taking is JUST AS MUCH for Here. Being around/seeing me causes stress (1/3)
I just so badly want her to be happy again. I wish i was still the reason for her happiness. It's all I've ever wanted for her. 
#ILoveSuzie
I hope Suzie has a great day today.  I hope not having to see me is making her feel happier and more at ease. I miss her and i love her.
Wherever you are just know that you are in my heart and on my mind.  I miss you! I love you Suzie! Goodnight.
#ILoveSuzie
#TryingToGiveSpace
I would give anything to have you here next to me right now Suzie.  In each other's arms where we both belong. Happy, safe, in love
And definitely this 
#NickAndSuzie 
This should be us tonight. 
#NickAndSuzie 
These next few days will be the longest I've gone without seeing Suzie in over 3 years now. It hurts so much. I'm going crazy without her!
Today I was told "you are a diamond. You are precious and shine brighter than anyone else." This person has known me since I was 11yrs old.
Much more interesting
Am i the only person who really doesn't care about this boxing match tonight? I have no desire to watch it or even here about it. #Lame

I refuse to throw away a 12 year+ relationship. We ARE TOO GOOD together. I believe we are meant to be STILL AND ALWAYS!  
#ILoveSuzie
I will do any and everything to make us right. My LOA is part of that. I don't want to drive Her Crazy anymore. This is for her as well.
I always have wondered and i always will wonder that.
@ShizukoLopez I'm so very sorry. You deserved more/better.  I know that now
I STILL BELIEVE! 
#IStillLoveSuzie
I believe in us.  Why couldn't she? 
I love Suzie Lopez with all of my heart! I miss her like crazy! 
#IWishSheCared
I hate myself for last night. I KNOW it wasn't all my fault... but i HATE myself for EVERYTHING i did. #Embarrassed #HeartBroken #Loser
All i wanna do right now is hold her close and tightly, kiss her, and tell her how much i love her and need her and never let go. #Real
Her texts, tweets to me, presents she bought me, pics of us, all the "I love/miss you's" How can it all mean nothing to her anymore?
It's barely been 24 hours and I'm going crazy without her. I keep listening to the voicemail over and over because i miss her so much.
I got a missed call/voicemail from her today and i don't know what it means. She'd be frustrated if I called her back.  Plus I promised.
Netflix... here... we... go!
I feel like someone reached inside me and pulled my heart out.  It hurts so bad it feels like i can't breathe. I wanna get sick.
my hand was THE moment i knew I was in trouble.  THAT was THE moment i fell completely in love with Suzie Lopez! #BestMomentEver (5/5)

I would give anything to take yesterday back.  To take the entire month of April back. To take back every tear I ever made her cry (1/5)
I will ALWAYS have them. 
I just spent the last hour re-reading texts we sent each other.  I'm even more confused now. There was so much love between us. Passion!
my better half, my lobster, my Minnie Mouse, my wish upon a star, Suzie Lopez is my EVERYTHING (3/3)
laugh (i snorted), my greatest feeling, my heart and soul, my best friend, my most romantic love, my desire, my truth, my soul mate, (2/3)
Through it all... i have, do and STILL love her unconditionally. At the end of the day Suzie is my happiest memories,  my hardest (1/3)
I just want Suzie to be the happy AMAZING person that I KNOW her to be. I want her to just smile because she has the world's BEST smile...
But now she just wants me to leave her alone. So that is what i will do. I won't call her,  text her or tweet her. She will have her wish...
Suzie was that one person who can make me smile and laugh no matter what, even on my worst days...
What do you do when your BEST FRIEND of over 12 years says you're nothing to her anymore? She can just so easily discard it all and smile?
What do you do when love doesn't love you anymore but your still in love?
I love you @ShizukoLopez
You should be here with me right now. I already miss you so much.  I hate going to dinner without you :-(
#Trying
@ShizukoLopez  Nobody knows what tomorrow holds.  Never leave conversations with the ones you love (cont) 
If something unfortunate were too happen to either one of us... Would you be happy with the last conversion we had???
Which is why I'm giving her all the space she could want starting tonight
Still... can't... Sleep...
I can't sleep.  My heart's just to heavy tonight.  Too much on my mind.  Too many things to be sorry for.  Too much pain caused. #HopeLess
Just realized i never got myself a shirt to wear for tomorrow night. ALL that REALLY matters to me is that Suzie goes
#Hopefull #IMSorry
Seriously... how did i become this bad of a screwup? I don't even know how/what I did it this time. This is why i need to fix me. #FML
Suzie's happiness has for the past 12 years meant the world to me above all else. When you truly love someone that's all that matters to you
I'm going to miss her so much.  But I love Suzie and WILL do ANYTHING to make her happy and make this right and better. #ILoveSuzie #Hope
Tomorrow is going to be a hard night for me. I'm hoping my new trying to be positive and a better person outlook/attitude will help.
Why can't i just stop screwing everything up? Why do i have to have so many DAMN feelings? Why can't i just shut up? What is wrong with me?
I suddenly feel sick to my stomach and can't breathe.  I don't want to have anymore panic attacks :-( 
Please God help me.
It well now be 3 weeks ago Tonight that i was the world's biggest asshole and complete jerk. Since (cont) 
There is NOTHING worse! 
I hope this never goes away. It's proof that no matter what she still loves me. Maybe some day she'll add to it #Hope 
100%
But what do i do if i love her so much it hurts?
@ShizukoLopez  this is the YOU i fell in love with. And still am
@ShizukoLopez 
@ShizukoLopez 
All i bring is anger all i bring is pain. I'm sorry.  So sorry
It's official.  I am the world's biggest fuck - up ever! I can't do anything right.  Even when all i mean is right.  I'm a mean person :'(
@ShizukoLopez

It truly was!  I'll NEVER forget it. She visited me while i was working on shipment in the back (cont) 
I want it!  I want it!  I want it!  #NickAndSuzie

The look in her eyes when she looks at me gives me Hope.  Hope is all i need to make this right. I'm NOT giving up.  #ILoveSuzie #BELIEVE
@ShizukoLopez is mine. 
I have been! 
Got almost 2 hours of sleep last night but no bad dreams :-)
Still hurt like hell to wake up/get out of the shower and you weren't there :-(

My goal! #LastChance #AllINeed #MakeItRight
I'm thinking i should just go home.  I'm not even sure what i did that was so horrible that I'm so awful i can't even be talked to. #FML

No gym tonight. I slept horribly last night and tonight pissed me off. Will try again tomorrow morning.  Need sleep and a better mood.
I have no patience for fake people in my life and someone has me questioning the kind of person they are.  I hope I'm wrong. #WeShallSee
Feeling good.  I could get used to this.  There's something energizing about being up at 6am and going to work out. Back at it again tonight
Had a pretty horrible night... doesn't matter... #2ADays start now @24hourfitness #JustBringIt #TeamBringIt

I miss this so much.  It should be us right now. 
I wish you missed me.  Even a little bit.  "Do i ever cross your mind... (anytime)..  I miss you"
#TryingToGiveSpace
I thought i had that.  If i did I'm fighting like HELL to get her back

I don't know if I'm over thinking things or if what i read means what it says.  I'm hoping to God it's just me.

Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?

I don't know if anything i said or did ever made her melt :-/
Except we would get thin crust :-)
The second she drives away i already miss her.

I'm actually getting used to being up by 8am every day now. It feels... good i guess you could say. Next week I'm going to shoot for 7am.
Today i got the joy of talking to my favorite little Princess whom I love beyond words.  She's absolutely AMAZING♡<BLACK HEART SUIT>♡<BLACK HEART SUIT> 
I would give anything to be able to kiss her goodnight. To feel her in my arms and her lips on mine the way only she can
#IMissSuzie
Ran 4 miles tonight.  I'm starting to get my stamina back slowly.  Taking the night off tomorrow then #BootsToAsses Saturday night!
Said me less than just two weeks ago.  
#IMissSuzie
#TryingToGiveSpace
I thoroughly believe this.  I also believe we'll find a way 
#Hopefull
OMG... I'm FINALLY out of work!  #TeamBringIt all day long today though! Gonna do laundry,  gym, then Re-up tomorrow!
My phone has been so quiet.  It's really sad.  I ALWAYS loved when she would text me throughout the day. I miss you so much.
Fighting HARD! 
Short night tonight. I really didn't sleep good last night. Nightmares! Managed to run at least 3 miles though.  Gonna push harder tomorrow
#DeepBreath...
Day 2... #BootsToAsses. Had a good night last night.  Felt good to workout. It's been too long.  #TeamBringIt
She looked today like I was the last person in the world she wanted to see.  Why?  :-(
I guarantee i won't. 
#Hopefull 
#Hurts
She's unquestionably worth it!  #ILoveSuzie 
Like i can't breathe
I'm definitely feeling that later
ALWAYS
That horrible feeling you get you honestly don't know if they think about you anymore or if they miss you at all :-/
#Hopefull
She's all of this to me. 
#ILoveSuzie 
Guilty every time I was with you. I wish you knew how much i miss you #ILoveSuzie 
@ShizukoLopez This should be us but i was an idiot. I'm sorry. I'm NOT giving up on us
love you with all of my heart.  I will do EVERYTHING I can to earn your heart back. (3/3)
beyond sorry. You deserved much better.  I WILL be that much better and more.  You are my queen and i promise to make it right. I (2/3)
It was one week ago tonight that i acted like the world's biggest asshole to you.   You didn't deserve that. @ShizukoLopez I'm (1/3)

On my 2nd hour of Supernatural.  Almost finished with the series now. I would still much rather be with you.
#IMissSuzie
#TryingToGiveSpace
No food compares to her♡<BLACK HEART SUIT>
I have a new appreciation for BLACKstreet's "Don't leave me"... if you take your love away from me I'll go crazy. I'll go insane. 
#Truth
Today would be the perfect day for the 3 of us to go to Disneyland. I'd give anything for that. I miss/love them both 
Lol so true

1. bombs
2. guns
3. bottle of shampoo dropping in the shower
Words everyone should live by though most of us don't...
"NEVER make decisions when you're hurt or upset!"
#Amen
And just like that work is done for the day. It was so sllloooowww... now i have a whole day ahead of me. To do... nothing.  Lol.  
#OhWell
:-)
#ILoveSuzie
Getting ready for my 3HR shift.  Awesome considering i haven't been scheduled in about a week now. 
#Nice
#DeepBreath
#BeAwesome
#Hoping
I can't help but wonder if she misses me.  Misses us and the amazing moments we've had together. Here's to being hopeful with a heavy heart.
My love for you is endless. My missing you constant. What we had worth fighting for. Our future worth hoping for
#NickAndSuzie
#ILoveSuzie
I'm more than ready! :-)
Tried that last night :-/
DAMN i miss her.  She's so HOT! 
#IMissSuzie
I miss you so much right now you are my heart and soul and i just want you to be happy again. 
#ILoveSuzie
Been up since 8am... i wish i could've worked today.  My days off are so lame now. At least I'm losing weight :-/
#IMissSuzie
#ILoveSuzie #TryingToGiveSpace
I'm going to leave you alone because you seem to have so much anger toward me and i just make it worse. I'm sorry Suzie. You deserve better.
The heart wants what it wants. My heart WANTS, NEEDS and LOVES you Suzie! 
#ILoveSuzie
I don't understand... What am i doing wrong?  Why does EVERYTHING i do seem to make things worse? Why am i so... ME?
All I want is YOU! 
#ILoveSuzie
I get the pleasure of having dinner with someone very special this evening.  I'm very excited and VERY lucky.  #YayMe
HA! Lol
DAMN i miss you so much!
On lunch... DAMN fresh and easy for closing down. #lame
I never imagined it would be so hard to NOT call you.  Please know that you are on my EVERY thought. 
#TryingToGiveSpace
#ILoveSuzie
No boyfriend blanket this morning :-/
Woke up because of a horrible dream. So horrible!  :-(
I can't sleep.  Everything just feels... WRONG.  You should be lying next to me.  I miss you so much :-(
#ILoveSuzie
5 straight.  I suck 
Yeah... it's official... i suck at pool. Josh is schooling me 4 games straight.  I wish you were here. 
I really hope i get to bring you here one day with our friends. I think you'd have fun here 
#ILoveSuzie
#NP #Slipknot 
Some mind clearing music.  Yes... i know... I'm NOT normal
Hangin out with my boy Josh tonight.  Clearing my mind and trying not to stress tonight. Just a chill night and shooting some pool #Breathe
My heart belongs to the most amazing woman I've ever been blessed enough to meet.  All i need is hope.  Hope and a clear mind. #ILoveSuzie
One more time for THIS season but definitely not the last time... #GOKINGSGO 
@freashstart is it Morphin' time Bradley?  #AppleWatch #Awesome
This made me laugh because i would do this for you. ME of all people!  Lol #ILoveSuzie 
What do you do when she seems happier without you but you want, NEED and LOVE her so badly you can feel the biggest emptiness without her?
LOL! Right?!
I'm honestly working towards that
I'm trying so hard
I hope this is true.
Amen!
Going up!
Taking every bit of me not to call or text you right now. I miss you so much #HardestThingEver
Taking a deep breathe knowing each day is getting harder but not giving up and NOT losing hope.  I can't! I believe in our love to much.
I have no doubt it's real. It's what keeps me going and hoping. #ILoveSuzie
NOTHING feels better!  NOTHING
I lost every picture I've ever taken on my phone. My microSD card failed. So many memories. Gone! #OfficiallyTheWorseWeekEver #MyHeartHurts
Our journey WILL be the greatest one of our lives! #N&amp;SForever
I'm not giving up.   I still have hope for us.  I Still love you! 

@ShizukoLopez 

@ShizukoLopez 
And just like that God throws me a shooting star. :-) Just made the biggest wish of my life.  Here's to hoping someone's watching over me.
The one night that i sit outside in Rancho staring at the sky and there's no stars out tonight. #CantCatchABreak
This is so much harder than i thought it would be.  :'(
I don't hate other people who find their happiness.  I'd never want someone else to feel how i feel.  I don't wish this feeling on ANYBODY!
... This world... I'm still here.  Someone once told me that has to mean something. Maybe it does...
@ShizukoLopez Yay 
@ShizukoLopez Happy Easter my bunny hunny :-) I love you 
Losing focus today.  :-(
Interesting! 
Had an amazing night with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez and princess Lily in which we saw Frozen Fever/Cinderella.  #ExcellentMovie.

I second that. 
@ShizukoLopez yay for us :-)
I love you
Going to bed now.  All of this anger and frustration has given me a bad headache plus my back was already killing me.
I'm tired of all of the BULLSHIT going on right now and nobody saying anything.  It's time to stand up. Leadership meeting tomorrow!
I'm so angry but this is something i believe i can do something about.  People who work the hardest for you should be treated like so.
Something my boss BK told me about a year ago.  It's hard but it works
I now must go buy a ceiling fan! 
The best one yet
True
It truly is a never ending battle

Why does it feel like this is the end of us?
This is true. 
I don't even see me in your eyes anymore.  I get the same look everyone else gets. Just minus your smile.  Just the "i don't care"
This was the worse week I've had in a long time now.  I don't see it getting any better either.
I feel like I'm just someone you know now.  Nothing more.  Nothing special.
Here's to unhappiness. You're always there for me.
I feel like someone messed up somewhere and i shouldn't be here anymore.

@ShizukoLopez hey. .. i love you!  Have a great morning hunny :-)
I woke up this morning feeling so happy.  Things are finally going to be on the right track after last night.  :-)
@ShizukoLopez  Oh Douglas Fir... You were the most noble of all the Firs'.  #OurFirstTree

@ShizukoLopez oh no hunny... Watch out behind you! 
Still up.  But luckily starting to get really drowsy.  I hate nights like these. Sigh...
I feel very small and very alone right now. It's going to be a long sad night. #iLoveHer
I'm very confused right now.  I don't understand what's happening.  I just want us to both me happy. Together. The way we can and should be
I wants one! 
Sad but true. Lol
@ShizukoLopez 
@ShizukoLopez 
I'm hurting so bad right now. Today is going to be a horrible day.
I just don't understand why you can't just let us be happy. Why?
@ShizukoLopez just know wherever you are right now I'm thinking about and missing you. I'm not going to let anything derail us. I love you&lt;3
Thank you Tyler for the talk outside tonight. Helped me refocus.
Earlier Tonight was a great example of how I'm a new man.  Some guy was hating and I shrugged him off.  Before I would've said something.
I'm functioning,  trying to plan a future for the first time in over a decade and it feels good.  I stumble (like Tonight). But I'm better
I'm not ok.  I'm still broken.  But I'm more in control now.  I'm not thinking about doing something stupid as much anymore either #progress
Knowing that I have those two in my life makes it a little easier to wake up every morning.
Thank for for my amazing bro Tyler and for blessing me with an amazing girlfriend that I love.
I'm not really sure what happened tonight. Today was an amazing day and then it took a nose dive at the VERY END. I'm so confused right now
Dude can give me looks all he wants.  You don't affect me at all.  You're just dust.  Get over yourself.  #HaterOfTheYearNominee
@ShizukoLopez I can't wait to see you today hunny :-)
@ShizukoLopez I love you baby!
She apparently doesn't know who Queen is either.  AND SHE gave ME the crazy look when I responded with "WHAT!?!?"
Just kidding about the two weeks notice part...  But don't think it didn't cross my mind. Some things you just can't forgive.  Lol
Today I found out that my boss doesn't know who Journey is...

I gave her my two weeks notice.
"Oh well..."
I hate how I feel right now.
Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. I'm living it with @ShizukoLopez 
I love surprising my girlfriend.  #yay

Had a rough day today.  Got hurt at work, was exhausted all day, I don't feel good,  now ending the day getting out late with a headache :-(
I hurt :'(
True story about an ex!
@ShizukoLopez  yay Disneyland us #HalloweenTime 
I'm a really great guy. Why do I feel like ending it all? I feel so broken.  I really am unwanted right now.  I'm scared.   I'm falling
I need a drink.  A lot of them!  :-(
:'(
1) tired 
2) don't have anything to talk about
3) over-thinking 
4) upset 
5) falling apart 
6) all of t…
@ShizukoLopez "wherever you go whatever you do... I will be right here waiting for you.  (cont) 
@ShizukoLopez I still love you!  My heart is in your hands.  Only you can have it.
I need you!  :'(
I need you!  :'(
I'm sorry
I'm trying so hard to pretend... I'm really not ok.
@ShizukoLopez Good luck on your interview my love.  You are going to be the best interview they have all day.  I love you!
@ShizukoLopez 
I love @ShizukoLopez! Someday I'm going to marry her and we will be the happiest couple ever.  We'll have the cutest kids #Eber!
I haven't slept since Saturday night.  Not counting on sleeping now either. At least now I have hope.  #AllYouNeedIsLove
@ShizukoLopez we are going to get through this.  I know we will.  You're my lobster. My true love.  My everything. I love you always too :-)
I want to be her real husband someday. 
@ShizukoLopez 
I want to go away and never come back.
I hurt so badly right now.
@ShizukoLopez I love you!
I can't wait to get home and talk to my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. I missed her so much today.  Especially after spending yesterday with her
I had a pretty good day today. I got to spend time with my grandparents. As I get older I'm realizing how important my time is with them.
@ShizukoLopez your flowers are very beautiful! But just like everything and everyone else they fail in comparison to your beauty. I love you
Lol
Exactly! 
AMEN!
@ShizukoLopez  Happy 15 months baby.  I love love love you!
@ShizukoLopez I love you with all of my me!
Happy first day of Halloween!   #Yay

What do you do when love doesn't want you anymore?
Omg I'm freaking STARVING!
WHAT!?!?
Happy birthday to the greatest of all time.  Happy Birthday to the King Michael Jackson
#KingOfPop #RIPMJ
Exactly! 
I just want someone to love me the way I love them. someone who is willing to work and understand that I'm not perfect but I'm worth it!
#Admitted
When it comes to drinking I'm like Captain America... just not as good looking! #NotEvenClose #OhWell
Thank whoever made Bacardi 151. I feel a little better/at ease and relaxed. Considering I'm 32 I don't think I'll ever actually get drunk.
I hate this feeling. It does not feel good! I hate being single. I hate not being with the person I love. I hate feeling so jealous #AAAHHH
I kinda wish I wasn't here right now.  I'm on vacation and this very second I feel so... just... unhappy.  #sigh
@BoyzIIMen I can't wait! It will be my 5th time seeing you guyz. #LivingLegends 
It was a month ago today that my happiness went away.  What a difference 1 day makes.  #StillHopefull #ComeWhatMay
A month ago today I was one of the happiest guys in the world for the 13th straight month. #Monthiversaries
I can't do anything right.
All I want is you!
... Especially when you're single but your heart is taken.
I hate being or feeling jealous.  It's the stupidest and one of the worse feelings in the world.  It's a feeling you really can't control...
I want to be the ONE you go to when something is bothering you.  I don't want you to call or talk to someone else. I'm here for you #Always
I don't like this feeling
I only want you!  I hope someday you will understand that.
That's why I NEVER have... Never will! 
Yes!
Don't say, show. 
Don't promise, prove
Oil changed.  
Car washed. 
Windshield wipers replaced. 
Now just waiting :-)
#yay
Whatever happened To romance?
I've officially been single for two weeks now. I've honestly hated every day of it. #IMissYou
Lol
Tomorrow is officially the start of a new month. A better month.  July was a horrible month.  Everything is new and fresh now. #YayAugust
My head hurts so badly right now
I hate this feeling.  I feel like I'm just a guy that she knows that she's cool with.  I don't want to be Just one of your friends.
I hate being single!
I just want a second chance.  I know it would be different. It would be better.  It would be... more.
Now I'm just another guy she knows.
I miss her saying "I miss you/I miss you too" and "I love you/I love you too". It was one of my favorite things In the world.
@ShizukoLopez 

All the time.

Every second.

Every minute.

Every hour.

Everyday.
I still love you!  I miss you so much it hurts! #HopingForASecondChance
#please
Sitting in the parking lot listening to her saved voicemails. I'm so sad yet I get so happy for those brief seconds. #OnlyBrokenHearted
Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep.  If I shall die before I wake. I pray the Lord my soul to take
I really just want everything to be over.  I just want to lay down tonight close my eyes and that's it. #NoMorePain #NoMorePain #NoMorePain
At Redondo beach right now.  #IsWhereIWishYouWereWithMe 
I'd give anything for you to be here WITH me right now 
#Exactly
Don't say, show. 
Don't promise, prove
Don't say, show. 
Don't promise, prove
No one can EVER accuse me of taking her For granted. I loved every single time I saw her or heard from her.  I truly appreciated her.
When you treasure EVERY single time that she tells you "I miss you" and "I love you" it makes it that much harder when she doesn't. :'(
...The amazingly happy Times we were going to have.
June was so magical. I HATE JULYS! We were so happy. Both of us! The happy Times truly out numbered the few bad times. Not to mention...
Why do I Have to feel like this? I should be be wanted.  Most guys can't compare to me.  So why do I feel like this? Why am I alone?
I know I'm a great guy. I'm romantic, faithful, loving, sincere, hopeful, selfless, understanding, patient, protective and so much more...
I forgot how much it sucks to be me.
Your heart doesn't lie. It can't!   Your mind does.
All my ex relationships Have felt the latter about me.   I'm hoping you'll be different
I thought I found that. I NEVER took her love for granted.
Everyday

Everyday.
I wish we could trade places so you can know how I feel.  Things would be so much different after that.  You would know!
I just want to be happy with you.  I know I make you happy too.  Happier than either of us had ever been.  #trueStory
Starting To think it will never happen
I woke up so happy last Wednesday.  The future seemed so bright.  Now I'm a mess and the future feels so dark.  #ItsNotFair #ImAGoodGuy
Got 3hrs of sleep last night.  I guess that's progress.  I only got two hours the night before.  So since Sunday night I've slept 6hrs now
I have! 
On to work I guess. Wish me luck
I feel so lost without her.  So little and empty
Why would anyone like being single I hate this feeling this is got to be one of the worst feeling in the world right now
Sigh...
I feel so unwanted. Nobody should ever feel this way
I'm scared
Today I've had multiple people come up to me to tell me that they just recently found out who my (cont) 
The pathetic part is that I'm still fighting for it.  So maybe I didn't learn anything from this.
...Either want you and want to fight for love just as passionately as you or they just don't/can't.
I guess if there's anything to take from this its that it doesn't matter how passionately you love someone and fight to keep them. They...
I didn't just lose one person I love by getting dumped.  I lost her and her daughter. There was so much I was looking forward to. #OverNow
Here's to wishful thinking
Doesn't exist
I've been how I feel right now more than I've been happy I'm my life.  Not everyone deserves to be happy.
I don't know why I let myself think I deserved more
I feel so unwanted.  In hindsight... I guess I'm right back to being who I really am... Me! I need to just accept it.  This is me
...The worse feeling is finding that person and then that person decides they don't want to be with you anymore
No... she won't
Claim your girl,
Love your girl,
Spoil your girl,
Be faithful to your girl,
Trust your girl,
and she will STAY your girl.
And now I lost both

It still didn't matter in the end
Thinking about calling off work again
4hrs till work and still have not slept yet.  I'm shaky and light headed.  Still alone.  Still hurt.
And just like that... My love is gone. I feel so empty now
I think I'm just going to drive for a while.   Better than being alone at home
And the night has just barely started.
I'm done with pretty much every emotion one could have right now.  I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted.  And Now I want to get sick
Mapquest says I'm 3 hours and 32 minutes from Vegas.  I could probably make it in 3. #AlwaysAnOption
YES
Dear happiness, 

      F@#K YOU!

Sincerely, 

Me
Today was one of the worse 24 hours I've ever had.  I'm hurt,  confused, alone heartbroken and lost. I want to disappear and never be found
On everything! 
The one time I hoped you'd be there... You weren't.  I guess that's how it goes
I was right.  Happiness isn't meant for everyone. It's not meant for me   I knew better. Now I'm just miserable and hurt and alone.
"Loving you is a dream; Losing you is a nightmare but loving you when i already lost you is a reality i refuse to believe"
I just want to stop. Everything to stop.
It hurts so bad!  Please God make it stop!
I am all alone.! That's it.  I don't have anyone to go to.  I need someone very badly right now.  Anyone!  I have No one.  Please God please
Today has been so hard and its not even close to being over.  I just want to go to bed. #TryingToGetThoughThis
I'm so tired and I don't feel good.  #SoUnhappy
@ShizukoLopez psst... I love you!  :-)
I know I've said it before... Tombstone is one of THE most awesome movies of all time! #HandsDown
Me and @ShizukoLopez got to see them as babies!
@jarretstoll Hey man... Hockey aside... I hope everything is ok and you have a full recovery.
I just downloaded the JAY Z Magna Carta app. From one to many.  Download yours at

Between the Kings winning and spending time with my girlfriend and the cool people I work with.... I'd say I had an awesome night! :-)
After a huge let down earlier tonight. Had an amazing time with @ShizukoLopez and the guys and girls from my work.  Loved having her there!

I disagree... could be just bad timing

Hehe. Lol
To be honest, I really don't give a fuck. I lose friends, make friends and make enemies everyday. Regardless, I'm still going to be me.
Amen!

I'm sure some do
Can't sleep. Have to be up for work soon. :-(
@ShizukoLopez yay for date night with my sexy amazing girlfriend!  #yay
@JimCarrey hey Jim, At work we were taking about our favorite Ace Ventura quotes and started wondering... Any chance for another Ace movie?
I hate when she doesn't feel good.  I wish there was something I could do to make her feel better.
1. No one will try and steal me from you. 
2. Sometimes I'm funny.
Amen
Lol
Lol.. will always make me laugh
The other night... I turned @ShizukoLopez 's water into WINE! 
#likeABoss
As I have learned
It has happened far too much
Sincerely,  me
She is definitely the bright part of my days.  I only hope I make her days a little easier too
It does feel nice to have her over for dinner and to spend time with my niece.  Whom has become quite fond of her.
It's times like this where I'm glad I'm there for my girlfriend.  I never want her to feel alone.
Had a great late Valentine's with @ShizukoLopez. Dinner,  talking,  and then watching The Walking Dead on my couch. #Love
LIKE A BOSS!
I'm so very very tired.  I actually feel sick that is how tired I am.  :-(
The good news is that Randy Moss STILL has zero Superbowl rings!  Congrats Ray Lewis!
@ShizukoLopez I'm sorry your 49ers lost baby.  They honestly got robbed on that holding non-call.  At least the played one Helluva game.
Took @ShizukoLopez out to see #WarmBodies. We had an amazing time and it was a great zombie date movie for my zombie loving girlfriend. #Nom

No, cough syrup, you're not "grape flavored". Have you ever tasted a grape? You taste like death and the tears of small children. Not grape.
Not revenge... But punishment!
Always!
Oh yeah!
Can I get an AMEN?!
Dinner at Chili's, drinks at the yard house, a NYE house party, ended with hot cocoa at Denny's. all with my GF @ShizukoLopez 
I love you!
Now that the Giants lost i'm predicting the superbowl to be the 49ers vs. the Broncos. With the Payton and the Broncos winning it all!
We should all try this

Amen!
I go there. #Crazy
Yes!
Shout out to Chan-dolph!
Merry Christmas from the best/cutest Christmas couple ever! 
Pretty much!
I still do this.
So I just recently discovered that my phone hasn't let me know when someone mentions me in a tweet for more than a month now. #lame
I tend to border on crazy how much I love *NSync's "Bye Bye Bye" #MightSoundCrazyButItAintNoLie
Awesome! I agree
@ShizukoLopez Happy 6 Month anniversary baby. I love love love you! #BestGirlfriendEver
I just re-celebrated the Kings winning the Stanley Cup. Not going to lie...It was still exciting and yes... a tear or two of joy #GoKingsGo
"Light you up put you on top let's fa-La-La-La-La La-La-La-La" hehe! I mean ho-ho-ho! ;-)
@ShizukoLopez I love you more!
NHL network is totally showing the entire Stanley cup finals in order all night. Reliving game one was awesome. #GoKingsGo #IWantHockey
I almost forgot how much I enjoy blaring MCR in my truck. And singing loudly along :-)
Every year "I miss you most at Christmas time". I love you Grandma. I wish you were still here. I love you
Truly the end of an era. The LAST #NintendoPower issue. 25 years of my life. Very sad! Damn the internet! #ThankYouNP 
I miss hockey! I miss my Kings! Winter is just not the same without the NHL
It kinda feels cool when your new boss recognizes you in street clothes and takes the time to make fun of you for being a Batman freak. Lol
Check out 80stees! 
I spent the whole morning fighting with my mom and now THIS.
@ShizukoLopez  Thank you for taking care of me while I had the flu this week baby. I was pretty miserable. i'm so lucky to have you.
@ShizukoLopez *kiss*
"somewhere out there if love can see us through. Then we'll be together somewhere out there. Out where dreams come true"
"and when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby. It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky"
"and even though I know how very far apart we are. It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star"
"somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer. That we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there"
"Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight. someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight"
@ShizukoLopez 5 amazing months and one amazing day with so many more to come I love you! I love you! I love you!
Happened so many times
@Skellington79 i'm sorry about your iPhone... That sucks. that's been a fear of mine for years now. #WashOfDeath
PARTY ROCK!
@ShizukoLopez I love you! I miss you!
@mishacollins Cass kicked ass last night! I'm glad you're finally back. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this season #Supernatural
Passionately!
I had a great night with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez Christmas time at Disneyland and DCA, dessert, then =3 vids. I already miss you!
Damn this wind! Its ruining my Christmas lights plans!
Lol. 
Its a must!

Oh Hey..... Youuu... ! Lol
I want a puppy! Damn you Animal Planet!

Or if everyone that said 'YOLO' has died from being an idiot.
And it sucks!

Now it sucks again
All I have left to say is #Ryan2016
#Obama first president to ever get re-elected to a second term who has gotten a smaller percentage of the vote than the first term. #Fail
Romney wins popular vote. Obama wins electoral college. Liberals who freaked out when Gore beat Bush in popular vote are silent tonight
My deepest apologies go out to our military and their families on the election results. We tried. #4moreYearsOfFailure
I kinda want to throw up a little. A lot actually!
Apparently Obama won. This is why more educated people need to start voting and stop saying "my vote doesn't count". Clearly it would have.
Like a boss! #RomneyRyan2012  #GoMittGo #GiveEmHellMitt #BuhByeObama 
Whether you vote a right (Romney) or vote wrong (Obama) the important thing is that you exercise your right to vote. #vote
#RomneyRyan2012
That would be amazing!
Haters are like crickets. Crickets make a lot of noise, you hear it but you can't see them, then right when you walk by them, they're quiet

I'm so excited to see my girlfriend tonight. Even if its just briefly. I love love love you baby @ShizukoLopez
Sometimes I wonder if certain people ever think about me. But then I think, if they did they would be in my life now. Or Atleast try to be.
In case you didn't know... AC/DC is THE greatest rock band ever! You may now continue your day.
I'm a perfect example of this. 
Amen!
That was totally me. #NeonsToo

Getting ready to see #WreckItRalph with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. Yay for Disney and video games (and lots of hugs and kisses) :-)

Hoping to see Wreck-It Ralph tomorrow. Not gonna make it tonight. #OhWell
Sigh...

"President" Obama should not be allowed to even mention President Bush's name. #NotWorthy
Anyone else notice that "president" Obama had yet to answer a single question? All his "answers" are about what he's done

Scary 
They are very real!

Lol. Yet true 
Damn straight! 

On my way to the interview. Not sure what to expect. I really appreciate all of the support and "good lucks". Its just up to me to #BringIt

EXACTLY! AMEN!
:'(  #tear
Truth!
You know how much you love her when seeing her sad or upset makes you just as upset. You would do anything to make things better for her.
As opposed to Obama?
Wow... this past term was fighting hard? #NoThanks

I's a ghost now. It's ghost me!
Just had another amazing night with @ShizukoLopez last night the fair and tonight was Disneyland. I am so lucky to have you. I love you!

@ShizukoLopez I love you!
@ShizukoLopez I had such a great time with you and lily tonight. I can't thank you enough. No fried frog legs! Or bacon wrapped turkey leg!
At the LA County Fair with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez having a great time with her and her daughter lily. I saw a zebra! #PartyRock!
Whoa... Now you've gone too far!
Saturday October 6th was supposed to be Kings vs. Ducks preseason at Citizens Bank Arena. Now its just a Saturday. #StupidLockOut #NoHockey

I'm sad because I miss my girlfriend. But i'm happy because I know she's out having lots of fun.
Exactly!
@ShizukoLopez I miss you with all my heart. I wish you were here
@ShizukoLopez I miss my girlfriend. Thank you for taking me out to dinner for our very happy 3 months. I love you!
Weird!
oo we oo I look just like buddy holly. Oh oh and your Mary Tyler moore. I don't care what they say about us anyway I don't care bout that
Installing the new apple ios6 on my iPad. Not sure what to expect yet. #hmmm
(in Stewie's voice) "I hate this place"

#Grump
I'm so jealous of all the rest of you who can just lay down, go to sleep, stay asleep and wake up in the morning like its nothing.
Thinking about turning Supernatural back on. Season 7 is getting interesting but I don't want to rush through the season. Already on disc 2
Can't sleep. Too hot! Too much on my mind! Can't get comfortable! Exhausted and feel like a wreck! #Frustrated
@ShizukoLopez Very happy Three Month-iversary to the best girlfriend any man could ask for. I love you Suzie!
Like I said at work... My focus is on my amazing, wonderful, beautiful, sexy, smart, honest girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. #LuckiestGuyInTheWorld
I can happily say I don't know a single thing about any of my ex's current lives, who they're dating (if anyone) etc.  nothing! #TheirLoss
Like i've said before... They didn't care enough about me to be part of my present and future. So why I ask about them?
talking about ex's at work today. Apparently they respect that I have NEVER EVER asked anyone how any of my my ex's are doing. why should I?
If you want to destroy my sweater Pull this thread as I walk away Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked Lying on the floor I've come undone
Omg yes!
Amen!
@ShizukoLopez  I love you more than words could say. I'm not used to feeling this appreciated. So thank you for being so amazing.
I left Spencers for the final time today. my head held high knowing this is the best thing that could have happened to me #NewBeginning
Celebrating the first day of Halloween time with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez  at Disneyland 
We REALLY DO!
Lol!
Enough of the fake and the bullsh*t. The dog is back! #DMX #Undisputed #GetEmX
If you are somebody's girlfriend, I'm sure you're great and all... But you have NOTHING on my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez  #BestGirlfriendEver!
Taking a nap with your girlfriend... Priceless!
That's me! That's me! 
I'm just sayin' 
Just thought I'd take time to tell my fellow Americas listening to "President" Obama right now... Enjoy the Kool-aid #FunnyLiberals
Omg yes!!! 
I'm seriously so mad i'm shaking right now.
@ShizukoLopez  I want so badly to take you away from all of this. I want to be your superman. (just not as gay) I love you!
Have you ever been so angry that you can't even think straight? That's how i'm feeling RIGHT NOW! I can't remember ever being THIS angry!
She's so pretty. She's a  babyamoo :-)  
Yet another night... Not sleeping #Frustrated
Amen to that!
"Please don't leave me, please don't go... i need you here beside me, to hold me, to comfort me, to... simply i need you" #TrueLove
I'm so very tired. Emotionally, physically, mentally exhausted. #GodPleaseHelpMe
"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"  so I ask... How strong must one be? 
#CloseToGivingUp
If it wasn't for @ShizukoLopez , I honestly don't know how I would've kept it together today without her. Plus she got to meet Hannah :-)
Today was one of the worse days i've ever had in my life. I've never felt so betrayed. I feel like I got stabbed in the back. #BitchMove
I got to see my little sister Hannah today. I've missed her so much. I kinda wanted to cry. She's gotten so big now and she's so pretty
I firmly believe in Karma. And you know what they say about her...
Today I learned that some people are just two faced cowards and liars who will go to outlandish lengths to try to take you down. #InShock
I feel like I have nothing left in me but hate. I have never in my life been this confused. I thought I finally found who I was looking for
I fucking hate happiness so much. All it does is play with me. All honesty does is betray me. why me? What did I ever do that was so bad?
And just like that my heart was re-broken. Happiness taken away all that's left is the dark. I'm alone again. This is why I hate being happy
Ahhh!!! I'm do miserable right now. I can't focus. I just want to go away.
No sleep for me. Too much on my mind. #exhausted
The reason why I fear happiness/good days and always will... Bad will always find you. And always when you least expect it. #always!
My girlfriend is so cool that she went with me to see The Expendables 2 for my second time. It was just as awesome as the first.
Yay me
This reminds me of my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez . She's secretly a pony. Shh..! Hehe #YAY #fluttershy  
There she is! 
Does anyone else have a mom with serious anger management issues?
I just heard about Robert Downey Jr's injury on the set of Iron Man 3 today. I hope the ankle will be ok and heal fast. Shake it off Tony!
What a rush! I totally want to go see #Expendables2 again Friday night!
Chuck Norris was DEFINITELY a man amongst men!
The Expendables 2 was so freakin awesome. It was like god's gift to action movies and men! Had an awesome time tonight. Thanks Rhett
@ShizukoLopez is mine and I am so proud!
... All while thinking about my amazing girlfriend @ShizukoLopez and missing her so very much! I am THE luckiest guy in the world
Happy National Rum Day everyone! I'll be spending it with my boy Rhett drinking at D&amp;B then the midnight showing of Expendables 2...
@ShizukoLopez  I'm sorry you've had such a crappy night my love. I'd give anything for you to never have another bad night or day ever again
@ShizukoLopez  I miss you more! :-)
I truly am the luckiest guy :-)  I'm starting to feel a happiness that I haven't felt in YEARS. Kinda scary. But I like it.
Plus I got to share a shooting star at the beach with @ShizukoLopez #romantic #SoCool
It was so nice to escape the horrible heat and enjoy the awesome weather of Redondo Beach. I finally got a chance to relax and get better
Spent an amazing and relaxing weekend with my AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL girlfriend @ShizukoLopez by the beach and ending it at Disneyland
indeed Tom. Welcome!
Killed it with that NERO remix! OMG! #EDM
That would be so awesome. I need to learn how to sleep so I get sickly less. Stupid insomnia!
I can't believe how big she's gotten. Luckily she hasn't said her first word yet. I need to get better so we can work on "Bazinga!"
My niece sounds so cute in the other room with her baby jibba-jabba! I wish I wasn't sickly. I feel like I'm missing so much baby time :-(
Atleast the conversation helped the time pass. Lol
People are often surprised of my lack of curiosity. I think I'm more surprised by their curiosity to know.
Then the question "well aren't you curious?" Came up and honestly... I'm not. Does it involve me? NO.
The way I see it is they didn't care about me enough to stay so why should I care what they do after they leave?
Today at work we were talking about ex's and I can proudly say that I have NEVER gone on an ex's Myspace, Facebook or twitter. #truth
I don't understand why some people can't just let others live their lives. Leave others alone. Try working on you! You obviously need it!
I can't sleep but its ok... I get to think of you @ShizukoLopez :-)
@ShizukoLopez You really truly honestly make me feel like I am THE luckiest guy in the world!
Halloween time. So excited! 
So excited to hear that Joss Whedon was confirmed today by Disney to be both writing and directing the Avengers Sequel. #Assemble
What the hell? Who tested this and why?
@ShizukoLopez You are truly an amazing girlfriend. I am so incredibly thankful for you and everything that you do. Thank you for being you!
@ShizukoLopez I miss you!
@ShizukoLopez Good morning BEAUTIFUL! *kiss*
Did you know...? Peter Cullen (the voice of Optimus Prime) is also the current voice of Eeyore!
Wow.. The opening cinematics to Kingdom Hearts 3D totally just gave me goosebumps #SoExcited
Hell yeah! #KingdomHearts  #10YearAnniversary 
But just barely!!!
Question... Would you rather be Tony Stark/Iron Man or Bruce Wayne/Batman? Hmmm..... I'm kinda leaning towards Tony Stark/Iron Man myself
@Skellington79 ouch... Harsh on the dark knight. J/k. Lol
It would be a first for me
Amazing night at the Drive-in with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. We saw "The Watch" and "Ted". So many laughs :-)
Getting ready to spend time with my amazing girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. I'm a very lucky man
Damn insomnia! I just want to sleep like a normal person.
@ShizukoLopez  "I feel on top of the world with baby..." 

 "You make me wanna say La La-La-la La La-La-La"
My last two girlfriends weren't very big on being "romantic" this feels different plus for the first time in a LONG time I feel appreciated.
@ShizukoLopez  I miss you so much!
EXACTLY!
Perfect example of my life right now.
Lol! Messed up... But funny
Truth!
I hate how I come back from vacation and I feel so frustrated today. 
AGHHH!!!
@81TimBrown happy birthday to who I believe to be the best WR I've ever seen play! Not to mention my favorite all time Raider #Retire81
True talent! #EDM
Its raining in Vegas. I'm hoping for thunder and lightning. Would be so #awesome
I miss my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez
Yeeeeaaaahhh baby! 
I'm in Las Vegas trick! #PartyRock  
Bacardi 151, Bacardi gold, Bacardi silver, a little passion punch, finished off with a Myers float. That's a Mai-Tai 
Tonight will be one month that I've been with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez. #IMissYou
@Skellington79 did you see "Dark Knight Rises" last night?
Due to me being in Vegas I won't get to see "Dark Knight Rises" at midnight but got IMAX tickets for me and @ShizukoLopez for Sunday night!
Get em DMc! #TeamBringIt 
Hmm
Discovered this my junior year in HS
LOL!!! 
Always!
 expecting the worst.<BLACK HEART SUIT>
Listening to "Larry's high silk hat" while walkin the Vegas strip. #VeggieTales
Hellllloooo Vegas
So excited!
Lol. Hell yeah! C'mon Howard come see what its like to be a champion #Lakers
@ShizukoLopez 
Every day!
5:30 am and still haven't slept. Can't fall asleep. #SleepFail
AMEN!
Tell me about it! Story of my life.
Spending my Monday morning in court. Is totally rather be at work. Not to mention I'm burning a vacation day to be here right now. #lame
Freakin sweet! #TeamMarvel  #NintendoWiiU
Lol

But pringles aren't single at all. They're constantly spooning. Slutty crisps.
Finally saw Prometheus with my girlfriend @ShizukoLopez tonight. it was actually a good movie. Started a little slow but delivered overall
Watching "Hulk" and... I don't remember it being this bad and cheesy. "The Incredible Hulk" is so much better.
We are a month away from the start of NFL Preseason. Are you ready for some football? I know I am! Raiders vs. cowboys #Raiders #JustWinBaby
If I mentioned how much I hate ghetto people? Along with that... There is NEVER a reason to "get ghetto" either! Its trashy and classless!
I don't blame you! I'd do the same thing!
Something must be wrong with me today... How did I of all people not realize that today is Friday the 13th?
Still working on getting Leila's first words to be #Bazinga
Spending time with lil Leila tonight. I'm so excited. Cutest baby ever! First I'm going to swing by and visit Suzie for a few #busynight
Easier said than done
There's lightning and thunder outside! So exciting! I love it!!!
Ewww!!!

&amp; Gym Class
 
The only two reasons

To shave your legs in the winter.
@Skellington79 lol. I'm totally a VeggieTales guy. "song of the Cebu" is my fav. Also "cheeseburger", "Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"
Nothing like blaring VeggieTales on your way home from a long day at work. Cebuuuuuuuu!
Not from my experiences.
I'm also back on my country music trip. I love it. Nothing else quite expresses life or how you feel like a good country song.
So apparently i'm sickly. I literally slept from about 3am this morning till about 6 pm tonight to get ready for work. Maybe I needed that?
People who buy Arco and other cheap gases like that either hate their cars or just don't know any better #LoveYourCar
Just checked on my baby niece Leila. She's fast asleep. I wonder what babies dream about. #hmmm
So I've finally been logging in some gaming time on my 3DS preparing for Kingdom Hearts 3D. When I will be Kicking some heartless ass! #Sora
Its almost 4 am and some jerk had their alarm going off... Since like 2 am. #BurnInHell!
Exactly!
"love me for who I want to be. Not for who I am". country songs will never steer you wrong!
Can't sleep... But just got to play Mario Kart 7 online for the first time and came in 3rd playing against 5 other countries #USA #USA #USA
Just discovered that someone from my past might be re-entering my life again soon. Not sure what to make of it. last saw each other in 1995
Lol! Totally agree!
Just saw "The Amazing Spiderman" and it truly lived up to it's name! BY FAR THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE TO DATE! Go see it!!! #TeamMarvel
I hate Bank of America! I wish Spencers had a better and closer bank
#PartyRock
Been on Oxyelite pro for 6 days now. Feelin pretty good. More energy and definitely feeling more active. #YeeeahhhBaby!
ok that was weird!
How do they know me?
=-O  
I KNEW IT! HA!
It's Quackamoo!
I had an awesome night with two people who are very special to me. Thank you Rhett and Lindsey. I missed you guys. can't wait to do it again
Damn... I thought I looked "ok" in the mirror
Finishing out the day by watching "This Is It". Thank you Michael! I love you! Rest in peace! #KingOfPop #GoneTooSoon  #MJ  #3YearsLater
Started a new Thermogenic today to lose weight. Hour number two and feelin good. #BringIt
It was 3 years ago today that we lost a legend. We still and always will miss you Michael. #RIP #KingOfPop #GoneTooSoon #MJ
Awesome weekend of movies. Saturday was Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (throughly enjoyed it) and Sunday was Brave. (great movie)
@honeybee1292 hey Bree... How's it going? I miss you at Spencers
I mean do girls secretly think this is hot and i'm just in the dark on this one? #HonestlyAsking
"Sagging" your pants is so lame. It makes you look dumb, doesn't mean anything and nobody is impressed by your lack of ability to dress
Yesterday At Spencers some punk kid was causing problems So I kicked him out &amp; told him to pull his pants up &amp; have some respect for himself
I don't want to work tonight. #StupidHeads
Damn straight!
LMAO!
I couldn't have said it better myself.
So i'm apparently on this weird Elvis kick. First time EVER! Must be all the Lilo and stitch I've been watching
Just got done watching Lilo and Stitch. Just in time to go work for Disney. Yes... I'm that big of a Disney nerd.
My Kings have officially been Stanley Cup Champions for a week and DAMN IT'S FELT GOOD! #WeGotTheCup
Paranormal Activity 4 is 4 months and 20mins away #soExcited!!!
@TweetYourScream So excited that exactly 4 months from now I will be sitting in a theater waiting for the midnight showing of #PA4 to start
#CoulsonLives
So sleepy! I think i'm probably the sleepiest one!
Congrats to the "Funniest M. F. Award" winner... Seth McFarlane
#GuysChoiceAwards
Holy grail of hot award goes to Scarlett Johansson. #amen
Congrats to Justin Timberlake. Spikes guys choice for Entertainer of the year award. #GuysChoiceAwards #JT!
I feel like a really old Ke$ha
Finally leaving Disney. I'm so tired. My feet hurt. I worked on our visual lighting so i'm covered in a combination of dust and glitter
Lol awesome
If it wasn't for Wayne coming to LA there might not even still be a Kings team to love. So Wayne... Thank you "Great One" #99 #KingsBaby
I know over the past few years I've been critical of him but I honestly would like to thank Wayne for opening the door for the Kings...
I can't say it enough. DL CM's I'm so sorry you have to deal with #GradNight during operating hours. The #ClassOf2012 are acting like idiots
Oh... in case you didn't know... #WeGotTheCup  #WeGotTheCup  #WeGotTheCup  #KingsBaby
Why is grad night during normal operating hours? Urge to kill rising! I feel for the DL CM's. the class of #2012 act like #ObnoxiousIdiots
This concludes the cars land event.  
4th time was just as awesome 
One more time on Radiator Springs Racers? I think so #FourTimesNow
Luigi's flying tires was so fun. Really unique ride idea
All of the radio stations #CarsLandMediaDay 
Why not? "i'm on it" 
It's a DCA me 
California screamin'... No line front seat... AWESOME
Loving the amount of Kings fans that went from the parade to Disneyland
DCA should always be this empty!
Impressed by the menu at Flo's cafe!
I actually raced someone this time.. And lost. Lol
Going on Radiator Springs Racers... AGAIN! #ILoveThisRide
Mater's jamboree was so fun!
Wow... And Disney is buying me dinner? #nice
Omg that was awesome! 
@Skellington79 today was so awesome! Still in awe of it all
Luckily for me... I'm used to being by myself places :-)  lol
This is the most amount of "plaids"I've ever seen
This would probably be cooler if I wasn't by myself
And i'm here 
I got free cars land swag! Lol 
So Awesome... Kings fans from the parade on the tram with me right now headed to celebrate more at Disneyland #GOKINGSGO  #WeGotTheCup
I will never forget this moment. #WeGotTheCup 
I still can't believe this day is actually here. #KingsBaby  #WeHAVETheCup  #GOKINGSGO #StanleyCupChampions 
Today's day... Drive from Redondo beach to staples center for the Kings parade. Then from there to DCA for Cars Land. #GOKINGSGO
Hell yeah! Waited way too long not to go
It finally came in. can't wait to wear it tomorrow at the parade #KingsBaby  
NHL Network. #GOKINGSGO  #WeHAVETheCup 
Congratulations to my 2012 NHL Stanley Cup CHAMPIONS LA KINGS! I'm so happy and so proud #GOKINGSGO  
I'm not ashamed to admit it... I cried tears of Stanley cup happiness #KingsBaby!
I never stopped! And we did it WITHOUT Gretzky!!!
Raise it high Dustin! #kingsBaby! 
We won! 
I've waited so so so long
I swear i'm dreaming
We did it! Kings are Stanley cup champions
It's gonna happen it's really going to happen. 4-0 #NineteenYearsInTheMaking  #GOKINGSGO  #WeWantTheCup

Yay for my J 
My Jacquelyn is graduating :-)  #LoveYouJ 
Best buy oh how I love you.
Omg I just want this day/week to end
Yesterday's fortune cookie fortune. :-\  
That feeling when you just want to disappear and never be heard from again. Yeah... That's how I feel. #BadWeek
Its been a long, hard, disappointing week. Especially today. Goodnight world.
Rough night. However I did say Kings in 5. Let's win it Saturday night. #Believe #GOKINGSGO  #BecauseItsTheCup  #RoadWarriors
My hell week continues. Both jobs back to back, some B.S. and I'm dizzy... All I can say is #GOKINGSGO #IReallyNeedThis
