my 67yr old mum &amp; I are equally floored by 5 more years under spamface. she's cheering herself up by going to see @SQUAREPUSHER #coolmum
on this bleakest of bleak days, I'm in big need of cheering up. c'mon my likeminded lefty pals, join me for beer &amp; hugs @TheDespard
@chongsparks :(
devastated. can't bear the reality of 5 more years of the tories obliterating our society &amp; humanity   
@optimisticunt @TheDespard looks beautiful there!
@optimisticunt yup :(
@optimisticunt it's a very sad day here
@kentishtowncats mind is blown, heart is shattered &amp; soul is screaming

@agleamandaglow I have no idea :(
@MrsVB I looked &amp; did a mouth sick. sorry, but he's awful
REALLY?! who wants this? awful, awful creature &amp; mentality 
@agleamandaglow I am so gutted &amp; struggling to comprehend this ridiculousness
@ADZMB15 started this day feeling happy &amp; optimistic. currently wondering what the fuck is wrong with people- nhs is gone. how we'll miss it
:(
@ADZMB15 i despair
@ADZMB15 :( I'm gonna leave. it's all too awful to comprehend
officially lost confidence in pretty much everyone. this is so much more depressing than living under thatcher. Britain: you have no soul
@Danielle_J_Thom like this? credit to @TheDespard &amp; his photoshop skills 
@sian_superman it's proper :(
@banana_the_poet @KieronMoyles :(
YES! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! this country is officially MORALLY bankrupt

WANT: 
me &amp; @TheDespard have made an executive decision &amp; decided to not open pub tonight so we can do some organising. back tomo @ 5pm quiz @ 8.30
@ThatFakeGuyDan true, but he's not the cat for the job. too lazy, cuddly (fat), nervy, arrogant, ridiculous. but also 1of the best cat evers
goosecat spends too much time seeing things that aren't there. he lives in a world inhabited by pixies &amp; elves &amp; shit 
@TheDespard they are so fucking shallow. slave my life to them &amp; they're a bunch of arses. *stomps off for a sulk, flicking v's at the cats*
thinking of going to an auction tomo-been looking at the lots, quite amused/intrigued by 291... @TheDespard 
oh dear, just did the monthly advocate flea treatment on the cats...
current cat relationship status: frosty. translation: they hate me :(
.@KTHopkins no, you're merely a hateful, media whore &amp; rent a gob. if you weren't so vile, you'd be laughable. crawl back under your rock
hey @kentishtowncats did legscat let you touch his stump in the end? or did you figure that would just be weird? 
aight...  
innit?  

@Danielle_J_Thom @TheDespard match made in heaven methinks!
@benwordsmith ditto. am assuming you've seen the je suis stuff &amp; the h****** army batshitcrazy dangerous bullshit?
@Danielle_J_Thom @TheDespard yes, probably! 2 cats, 6 legs. but a (sadly legs impotent) cat romance... he still says send pics :)
:D
she's mindbendingly vile, I find myself at a loss what to say or do. why was this monster ever given a voice?

(in relation to my response to above tweet) 
where do you find this shit?
@kentishtowncats ha. *spits tea (wine)* great cat face
@TheDespard *a* dammit!
@TheDespard @djlizw this is w frickin awesome tune! 
although still hoping someone will do this: 
hahahahaha.... 
WHOOP! c'mon hilary!  
hilarious statement of the day:
you prob don't have tenses in Italian do you?
to my Italian barman, who smiled &amp; rolled his eyes... #skills
has anyone has done the maths on how a cat can take up a massively disproportionate amount of bed/duvet space? 
@kentishtowncats no you fuck off. is this kind of a new version of the 'no you hang up' phone flirt thing? if so, it's much better

"It's because he's a cunt", I replied.
@TheDespard but he could be anywhere tomo... the nasty, pernicious little bigot
farage is doorstep campaigning...oh, if that freak knocked on my door, what fun i would have with the nasty little man
@CiaranOGrady2 @laurenceogrady @TheDespard I like the name!

@barnabysalton no problem! see you tonight
@barnabysalton hi, the big table is already booked I'm afraid. but can book you another one. how many people?
@TheDespard @Dante_Banks totes, what we having?
ha, too funny... (or is lolz the correct phrase?) 
so, phone thief &amp; driver of blue Audi y442pvj, I have a new phone &amp; the police have ALL of your details. good luck with that, twatface.
it's going to be partly cloudy.
and on a hill.
@Elsie__Pea too cool,smokin' cat.
@menaman1 top skills. it'll definitely be somewhere: that probably makes no sense now, but it will when all of the senses kick in tomo...
@Elsie__Pea awwww. what a guy! lovely cat. i'll tell my 2 bout the backup, tbf they're proper napping on the job (not functioning at all)
@chongsparks plus, reliable norf laandaan taxis are rare &amp; not to be messed with!
@IdealCynic @kentishtowncats yea, but still utterly forgettable, which means we can forgive ourselves for vaguely (un)remembering him/stuff?
@chongsparks am still struggling to inform the relevant authorities as to the whereabouts of my stolen phone. the thief is aware &amp; in ilford
@Steeeks @TheDespard @JohnPReade :( hope not
@kentishtowncats what, him? really? - the needy weird guy in lycra years back &amp; now having an ego meltdown? he's a bit letigious/humourless
yo! phone thief guy: you can anonymously leave my phone at the bar in the pub you stole it from - up to you....
@kentishtowncats yay *dances the 'nancy drew top sleuth' winning dance thingummy*
or sommat
if you haven't already, you really should read stalky &amp; co -+ kipling &amp; obviously all of roald dahl &amp; richmal crompton
@Steeeks @TheDespard @JohnPReade just need to learn to drive and also acquire a somewhat ridiculous sheepskin coat....
@kentishtowncats samsung won't let me see your/their avis - android &amp; apple should probably wrestle this shit out?
@Steeeks @TheDespard @JohnPReade i'm thinking of popping round for a cuppa. "If not today, then....soon......"
dammit. wish i could drive..
@Steeeks @TheDespard @JohnPReade the worst of it is dealing with the phone provider &amp; insurance. being stolen from is the 'easy'  bit :(
@JohnPReade understood. but i know where my phone (thief) is - i even offered him the chance to return it.  I wish i could drive
@Steeeks @TheDespard @JohnPReade wasn't planning on getting stabbed, just want my phone back &amp; him arrested for being a prize c***
@TheDespard @JohnPReade lol
thiefguy- i'm still massively cross about this - i will now find you. i gave you the chance to return the phone. dirty thieving dickheadarse
@Elsie__Pea i'm sending stevecat and goosecat in...reckon they're poised &amp; ready &amp; practising their 'sweeney'..."we're the sweeney son..."
. @JohnPReade taxi round trip £50 - what you reckon twitter people?
@highwaystarzo @BolshyBumbleBee lol
ilford? anybody?
fucking fuming.
fucking thievingcuntarsetwat
@the_anke nothing that dramatic- he posed as irritating guy selling greetings cards &amp; swiped it. i even tried not to be rude to him!
@highwaystarzo @BolshyBumbleBee not yet :( but do have his address &amp; telephone number - am hoping that as i asked nicely for it back, he may
@Elsie__Pea enjoyed exercising nancy drew detective skillz.
woke up proper cross: pints of tea &amp; chainsmoking in my pj's til i found him
@Elsie__Pea lolz &amp; which you've listed on t'internet for sale. he's obviously not a smart guy...
@Elsie__Pea if i could drive, i'd've popped round...
but gonna leave it to the proffessionals :D
weird looking at his house on streetview!
found out where thiefguy lives. silly man advertised car, reg plate &amp; house. streetview rocks! long arm of law on way #nancydrewskills
@Smashinblouse1 just furious! can't wait to find the fucktard. everything is complicated to sort on a weekend, AND it's abank holiday...
@blumphington phone nicked last night by a guy driving a blue audi reg: y442pvj....
BOOM! got a phone number for the guy that nicked my phone.....i will frickin crucify you, you will be found, i promise. details with police
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo *proper belly laughs* ha, cheers all,  needed a bit of perspective, mwah, xx ps: if you see that audi....
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo i already have - it says pending. who does that whole secret account thing anyway? (apart from this guy/gal)
@kentishtowncats locked account - looks like we're all ranting at an invisible thing / person etc...
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo them or me? i think it's a great &amp; much maligned word. should be resurected &amp; cherished
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo who the fuck is @highwaystarzo btw?
@Elsie__Pea urgh. tell him to sod off and them block him. once done, sit back and feel awesome!
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo not robbed from my pub - closed for easter &amp; having a night off! stoopidly let my guard down :(
@kentishtowncats @highwaystarzo thieving to live &amp; eat in this hardarse world, ok. thieving &amp; driving off in audi? shitty bastard arseface
@kentishtowncats hope so. not so good get robbed at 9pm on a sat.. but if they steal my identity i hope they make it frikin superhero ridic
@kentishtowncats nah, saw the bastard getting into his car. vaguely amused that my phone screen was cracked, scared that it could be hacked
@kentishtowncats i'm proper tamping. phone thief that drives an audi?! if it was stealing for food, i could live with that #robbingbastards
dark blue audi registration y44 2pvj
Some some cunt robbed my phone tonight - hopefully not identity &amp; details etc. if you see owt suspect, please dm - i'm not flogging raybans!
@Steeeks i kinda admired her chutzpah

oh dear, it's now super late (early). knew i shouldn't've watched the debate - now i'm proper tired &amp; massively cross. 'kin' politics!
. @David_Cameron you &amp; your party make me despair. you were born into privilege &amp; you have no insight into the real life of normal people
aaaarrrgggghhhh... that garage @Nigel_Farage guy is horrendous.
do hope that people can see his slithery poison for what it is.
nigel 'garage' still being a massive tosser.
how do we make him go away?
he's worse than spamface.
but they're both making me VERY cross.

horrid hypocritical posh banker boy- pretending to be 'one of us' 
wake up people!
@kentishtowncats @Nigel_Farage ooofff. just seen that. am apoplectic with rage. what a hateful, horrifying, vindictive creature. loathsome
@ambienteer @TheDespard we see all strata of nhs staff. they pretty much all say the nhs is being sold off
@ambienteer one would hope so, but many are unaware of the extent of the dismantling the tories have already implemented..
@ambienteer nige: an utterly vile, hypocritical, self-serving, bigoted arse. &amp; yet some people like him-it depresses me a lot @Nigel_Farage
@ambienteer fingers crossed! thought thatcher years were bad. hope we don't just accept loss of the nhs etc like we did with industry, rail
knew shouldn't've watched this now. it's prob not healthy to be this frickin angry at this time of night &amp; i know there's way worse to come
@ambienteer thank you. watching it now &amp; being very cross. i hope everyone was similarly cross earlier?
@kentishtowncats is he the new bojo/william hague? :(
@kentishtowncats ...that twat @rustyrockets encouraging people not to vote doesn't help either. voting is a right &amp; should be embraced

@harlequinpub :D damn straight!
@harlequinpub haha! same, but beer &amp; whiskey tasting rather than gin. *puts kettle back on* *attempts to reason people out of dry january*

on a lighter note: got 'super scrabble' being delivered in the next week. if you like words &amp; have (at least) 3 hrs to spare, game on!
@ABC @BBCNews it would be funny if it wasn't scary, sad, weird &amp; downright harmful.
