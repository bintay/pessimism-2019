#UKIP MEP -candidate in #newark  by-election wants to 'cure' #gays on #NHS  
How I asked #EdMiliband about #hope 
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch Fine! I'm with you. My point: migrants are not the cause for problems. Are you with me?
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch Aging population. More over 65s that under 16s. Migrants' kids will provide social care.It all naturally will fit
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch We need to urgently find £6 billion to fund health&amp;social care.Migrants' &amp; children will fund it.
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock I'm a migrant. Shocked? have some respect, mate, I'm asking you for the last time.
@SirGully @yourthurrock Their contribution pays for almost all schoolling in England. 40%NHS staff are migrants.Will you learn some respect?
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock Evidence every time you state discriminatory statement, please.
@SirGully @yourthurrock Eu citizen brings on average £6k a year net contribution while Briton takes out £11k. Have some respect, mate.
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock I respect your view.But understand - migrants are NOT the cause of problems but the opposite
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch It's true.It's UKIP's &amp; right wing media propaganda that we're flooded.We're not.Let's keep things in perspective
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock I'd love too,but never for Tory ;-) Open ur eyes,blaming migrants for what they'nt done wont' help
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch Evidence, please! Otherwise, stop discriminating 2% of the community, it's not ok,and it won;t solve problems
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock We should thank them for the £9 billion a year net contribution, mate, and start building houses
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch Not,it's the fact we haven't built affordable houses &amp; greed of landlords. Labour will sort it out.
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock EU migrants bring £9 billion NET contribution a YEAR to the UK.While Britons are not.
@SirGully @VoluntaryAnarch @yourthurrock Please read in full and only then tweet me:
@SirGully @voluntaryanarch @yourthurrock it's not a proof that it's the fault of the 2% of population-stop discriminating people.It's greed.

@Trev_Forrester EU PROTECTS our rights! U can complain to EU on Any issue &amp;they will hold the Gov to account! It's protection from Gov abuse
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets you are the second who told me I'm Meerkat! Lol Good,no one told me I' like Farage or Cameron.I have values
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets I hope you will! You have hot plus for that!
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets Don't want to kick anyone out-leave migrants alone,thousands of men,women&amp;kids. Let them live inPeace&amp;dignity
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets Commissioners are government. No gov is elected - the UK's one is not either.
@HillonMarkets 100%! that's not age related by the way. IQ is not knowledge - it's problem solving &amp; intelligence.
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets lol. Are you getting it now? :-) does somebody must point it to you in order you to understand? Pe
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets @peter_lote Germany is not a Threat. It's domination with Russia might become if UK withdraws from the #EU
@HillonMarkets @trev_forrester Never!!!! Always going to fight #UKIP #Tories far right, discrimination, racism, exploitation&amp; manipulation!
@HillonMarkets saying that something is kids' fault? Sorry but THIS is ludicrous. And I'm back to work, more fruitful.
@HillonMarkets @peter_lote @trev_forrester thanks,u're third person who calls me Thatcher! I hate her but the work ethic &amp;goal focus is good
@HillonMarkets have u heard about BJ IQ gaffe? And my son has actually answered the IQ questions BJ couldn't! So don't insult kids pls
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets @peter_lote Yes, the only way to stop Germany is UK strong in the EU - balance!
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets @peter_lote when I have time, I'll read it, I'm very busy now! But thanks, do send me more, much appreciated!
@HillonMarkets @peter_lote @trev_forrester #UKIP is a one man who seeks fame- his actions're similar to Hitler's propaganda-he's dangerous!
@HillonMarkets @trev_forrester @peter_lote tell me first why Brits go abroad! Lol it's normal, people have always migrated
@HillonMarkets @trev_forrester @peter_lote I did so repeat: services are under-invested. We need migrants-£25 billion net contribution
@HillonMarkets @trev_forrester complete rubbish- no evidence! My son is 5 and his English is perfect! And IQ higher than Boris Johnson's
@HillonMarkets @trev_forrester education &amp; health are two most invested services by #Labour - #UKIP brings destruction! U care? Swap Party!
@Trev_Forrester @hillonmarkets i have this country best in my core, too &amp; the only way forward is modern, human &amp; economic progress!
@marketonclose @hillonmarkets @trev_forrester human destruction is the discrimination that #UKIP &amp; similar bring! Hitler brought it too!
@Trev_Forrester go back thousands of years,that's where yours and #UKIP views are! Not fit for civilised society! Disgraceful discrimination

@HillonMarkets @Trev_Forrester no evidence that it's migration. Alan, UKIP is playing on minds of people like you- Hitler did once, too.
@HillonMarkets @Trev_Forrester if I rule the country, I would sort it out, promise!  Ps. That's not a fault of migrants, though.
@HillonMarkets @Trev_Forrester You probably mean: their 1st language is not English-pre-school kids speak great English, I know many!
@Trev_Forrester @Peter_Lote @HillonMarkets EU citizens work more=pay taxes &amp; don't take as much benefits.There really is no problem!
@HillonMarkets @Peter_Lote @Trev_Forrester because it was once a good country, before UKIP has risen! Alan: Germans used to love Hitler,too!
@HillonMarkets @Peter_Lote @Trev_Forrester that's Tories fault-EU citizens bring £25 BILLION a year a#UKIP &amp; #Tories should be thankful!
@Trev_Forrester @HillonMarkets we are NOT talking about illegal immigration! Stop mixing things.  Discrimination is illegal!  #UKIP #UE

@HillonMarkets The stop talking like you are
@HillonMarkets Until u understand that we're all equal &amp; deserve equal treatment u will never agree. We're talking about basic values.
@HillonMarkets it fillsMe with deep sadness that people think it's ok to discriminate others. It leads to deaths.U're not better than others
@HillonMarkets all those equal &amp; equally contributing should receive equal treatment. It's all too easy to blame &amp; cut off others.
@HillonMarkets No, sorry.ALL people deserve support bec they're PEOPLE. Do u think being born British make u better?More deserving? No.

@HillonMarkets Leaving EU would harm UK. Not good idea.
@HillonMarkets do u blame disabled, elderly, ill, dying people of putting a strain?Or families?Or children?No?Stop blaming migrants.Inhumane
@HillonMarkets Not EU citizens.People can barely afford to live now. Surely ingerention how people spend disposable income is a bit too far?
@HillonMarkets yes, blame the gov. Build more affordable houses, employ more doctors is the only solution to a shortage!
@HillonMarkets the truth is: people struggle. All. We need to unite to make it better for everyone not blame the weakest in the society.
@HillonMarkets u're mistaken.They don't send 50% home.Take away 50% income of poor people and they die.Who told u this?Daily Mail or UKIP?
@HillonMarkets blame politicians that cannot manage the country. It's appaling to blame people for it.But that's what politicians do.
@HillonMarkets what strain on services? £7 billion net contribution is not a strain - it's a contribution.
