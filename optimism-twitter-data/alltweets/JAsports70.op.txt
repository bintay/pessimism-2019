Beltan heating up. #Yankees
And according to Paulie the entire world shits rainbows.
I'm a huge Paul Oneill fan, but he has an awful on air sense of humor.  @YESNetwork
@JudsonK217 very good analogy
@BigBadWolf_1 less than zero
This is why Gardner is not a star.  Ridiculously stupid play.  #Yankees
If Gardner ever could steal the  bases he had to, he would be a star.  Still a very nice player.  I'll give cashman him.
I expect to win michael Pineda starts.  He is the #Yankees ace.
@jwelge96 @4mattie not even close.
@FranksYanks23 @NYDailyNews I love Jorge but stop now.
@FranksYanks23 @NYDailyNews article about being bitter at the Yankee ending he had.  Total bulllshit.
@JForma Jorge has let that Puerto Rican pride thing fog his head.
Jorge is a guy with huge ears, total inability to block the plate, with a hot wife, 4 rings, and 40 million to spend.  Shut the fuck up.
Jorge complaining is like a power ball winner not wanting to pay the 49 million in taxes.  Enough.
@4mattie talked about how pissed he was when he was benched or made to DH.  He wrote a book nobody will read.
Jorge lived the life millions would die for, to say your bitter the way it ended is contrite. Stop w the bullshit and go spend your fortune
Jorge #posada needs to relax, he had a great run, very good yankee.  When it's over it's over.  Stop with the whining.
Be legit.
Roof torn off.
@davetheflashguy long one ahead.
Vodka and lemonade monster.  #fuel
Whenever I "pregame" a few drinks before actually going out, usually means I rip the roof off wherever I'm going. #pregameongoing
In that mood.
Saturday phase 2 done. #gym
Saturday phase 1.  Unstoppable Randolph hooks W 11-3.  #gymnext.
I don't like my star rookie DE wearing a gaurds number.  Cut calvin pace.  #97. #jets
I say pitch Hanley.  He is going to break the monster running into it and it's a baseball heirloom as ugly as it is.  #RedSox
@ShadaLibra17 maybe they should braid them this year.
Game, gym, letting loose tonight.  #theplan
My allergies suck this morning and I don't have allergy problems. You people that do are simple fucked.  #happysaturday.
I love when the #redsox spend their way into last place.
Open auditions for starting pitchers this morning at Fenway.  #bostonsportspain
@FranksYanks23 and the yanks roll along
@FranksYanks23 hank cracked tho Holtby didn't.
@rangerfan014 not sure but can they afford it? Cap wise!
A blind stick figure would stop #nyr shots on goal.  #embaressment #Rangers
@FranksYanks23 embarrassing
@FranksYanks23 nope
The #rangers are a joke.
@BigBadWolf_1 @seriesfever2015 I hope not
@jason_kaleta isn't he already?
@jason_kaleta leave my twitter hyperbole alone.
@jason_kaleta Hanley will win the gold glove and wade Miley will have an era under 6.  #bostonpipedreams
@jason_kaleta I'm sure lol
Maybe belechick can be the #redsox pitching coach in September.   He may have the month off too.  #bostonsportspain
I bet Brady plays the monster better than Hanley.  Give him a shot in September.  He will have the time.  #bostonsportspain
Maybe tom Brady can pitch for the #redsox in September while he sits around.  Gotta be better than wade Miley.  #bostonsportspain.
There's literally a 78 year old woman sipping a @jamesonwhiskey sitting next to me at this shitty pub.  #happyhour.
Boston is going to burn after the Brady suspension is handed down.  Those fuckers aren't going to be able to handle it.  #Deflategate
Town pub glen ridge nj.  First time in my life I ever pre gamed a 10 year old little league game.  #TGIF #gocrush #beatglenridge #iminsane.
@newkingofmedia because it's not real misery.
Optimistic #ranger fans are obviously 25 or under.
@drmtesta the 45 rings In 12 years have unhinged the boston sports fan
Boston fans are hystericle.
@GreedyStripes @GorgesSteven @BillWillisf3 @Draft2Dynasty @Charlie_Ricker @Sportschic80 Ty
@FranksYanks23 @john_zsoldos @realmrmom @Danimaltrent @GardenFaithful @Princess_in_NY @NYRangersZone that's insane
Absolutely the #redsox pitching nightmare is the coaches fault.  Lol.  I'm so glad the circus has moved north.
@7BOOMERESIASON in full #Rangers excuse mode.  Stoooooooopppppp
@john_zsoldos @FranksYanks23 would love duclair back yandle has done nothing.
@FranksYanks23 @john_zsoldos find a place for Nash.  I know he is doing the lil things, but we need goals.  That's what he is being paid for
@FranksYanks23 @john_zsoldos totally agree.  So bad I think it's time to re tool.  This is as far as this group can get.
@FranksYanks23 rangers since 2012 in this run, never make things easy.  Never a laugher, this year ends badly.
@FranksYanks23 ducks would crush them too.
@FranksYanks23 agree
@FranksYanks23 I give this team very little chance to pull this off.
@FranksYanks23 when I watch Chicago I realize the rand rangers aren't that good
#rangers weren't beating tampa, Chicago or ducks anyway.
Despite what the #yankees front office thinks, the game must be stopped for arods 3000th hit.
@KPNYJ last interview felt real.
Starters gave to go deeper in games or this great bullpen will be on fumes sept 1.  #Yankees
Arods literally said the right thing every day this year.  I think it's more surprising than the numbers.  #Yankees
@jsls315 it's a good point
#startspreadingthenews
@newkingofmedia take it a week at a time.
@JohnSport111 ala john wetteland.
#MillerTime back to being ridiculous.
Miller is all over the place.
#betances literally toys with the American League.  #Yankees #seveninninggame
@SluggerBro 45 million.  #firecashman
Betances is unfair.
Eovaldi is batting practice.
Tex doesn't do singles.  #Yankees
Tex is an extra base machine.  #Yankees
@NFLguy07840 blinds squiirks are only right once a decade.
@johnnyrotten23 tanaka isn't z330lbs
@KPNYJ pass the pipe.
25 and under types believe the rangers aren't done, CC sill Has a chance, the tooth fairy is a possibility.Optimism is fleeting enjoy it now
@AfroJewMan which is why your cluelessly optimistic.  Enjoy this time.  It's fleeting
@AfroJewMan your def under 25
@rangerfan014 blindfolded
Pass pass pass pass pass pass pass #rangersoffensivegameplan.
@ggonzalez03 teams just not that good.  No where near cup worthy.
Hello I'm 19 high as a kite and think the #rangers can come back down 3-1.#nyr.
#rangers inept in all areas.  #blowitup.
Holtby with a save lundquist is getting paid for.  Season over .  #nyr.
Another pussy shot on goal by the #nyr
Where's all the 20 year old #Rangers fans full of confidence? Welcome to the misery motherfuckers.
@BigBadWolf_1 lol ty
@ggonzalez03 they don't deserve it
The #rangers in dire need of a goal is like me backstage at the Victoria secret fashion show desperately seeking a blow job.  #NYRvsWSH
#rangers hit the ceiling, trade the goalie. Blow it up and start over.  #nyr
Series over, #NYRangers
Inexcusable McDonough
The #rangers are a fraud.  Blow the team up.  I've seen enough
Season over #NYRangers
Patrick Ewing and henrik lundquist remind me of one another and all three of us have the sAme number of rings. #msgblues.
@newkingofmedia which is why you fire whatever assholes who don't learn from your very accurate tweet.
Just saw caps replay goal.  Henrik is Swiss cheese.  Holes all over. #Rangers
CC is going to go 5-19 and cash a 25 mill paycheck.  #firecashman
Take CC out back and shoot him.  #Yankees 55 year deals ever work.  #firecashman
@MichaelPawluk @FranksYanks23 they all suck and won't sniff a cup.  Blow it up.
@MichaelPawluk @FranksYanks23 there's no other way to state it Holtby playing better and will likely advance
@FranksYanks23 @MichaelPawluk I'll settle is Nash sucks too.
Sit stepan.  A figure skater does more
@FranksYanks23 @MichaelPawluk with this shitty team?  On,y choice.
@FranksYanks23 @MichaelPawluk except Holtby is great and henrik overated.
@newkingofmedia tex is a shock the industry will tell u that.
Stop the fucking puck king.
Fuck u lundquist.
Life's curveballs.  Good thing I rip the shit out of the breaking stuff.  #imgood
The thing that makes the #StanleyCupPlayoffs so good is the Margin of error is the width of a pubic hair.
If CC can't get out this depleted blue jay lineup?  Who can he get out?  Bench CC bench Beltran it isn't 2007. #firecashman
Holtby is playing up to henriks contract and therein lies the difference in the series #nyr #NYRvsWSH
Holtby for president #NYRvsWSH
#rangers have zero nose for the net.  Ultimately a stupid team.  #nyr.
Can we auction off CC like other 340lb cattle? #Yankees
Dear #rangers in order to get anywhere you need to send the lil back thing to the back of the net thing.  Just doing my part to help.  #nyr.
The Beatles were together the last time the #Rangers scored.  #letitbe.
Caps defensively out ranger the #rangers
The caps are making the #rangers look like boys early.
@nysportswoman why?  Cc's contract costs me 700to see a game. He should be nice and retire.
Pirela can never leave the line up or u #firegirardi
Cut CC cut Carlos cut Drew.  The stink of the clubhouse will go away a day later #yankees.
Pet peeve of 'mine.  300lb pitchers on 34year contracts.  #cc
@GreedyStripes I hate 300 lb pitchers on 30 year contracts.
Less Drew and Beltran and more somebody else the better.  #yankees #firecashman
@newkingofmedia the less of Drew and Beltran see the better.
@jwelge96 Drew will flail  as much as DIDI would have vs the lefty.
@jwelge96 rather DIDI.  I'm done w Drew the pirela off the DL needed to be a msg to Drew. Girardi makes me scratch head
@newkingofmedia just checking
Jose pirela needs to be at 2b.  Wake up robot.  #Yankees
The more u think about it, francesa and dog were the most fucked up, nonsensical, entertaining pairing in history.  Any catagory.  @WFAN660
@GL0401 and trainers that work with more than one horse owner.
@GL0401 I think I was using an app listening to it.  Apps and snowblower change the world!!!
@GL0401 fav was 3 yrs ago secretly explaining how the radio app was going to revolutionize the world,how really smart guys were workin on it
@GL0401 then he reads the texts an hour later after everyone already saw them on twitter.
Totally forgot how much I enjoy an ice cold @DosEquis I never buy it home.  That's going to change.  #SummerPlans
The only #nyr fans not shitting bricks tonight were born after 1994.  #mustwingame.
No wAy rangers are coming back 3-1 vs this caps team, so tonight is for the season.  #NYRangers #NYRvsWSH
Francesa taking 20 mins to find these texts is pretty funny.  Guys dumb as a stump.
God for fucking bid you let a cursing starter finish. #firegirardi
Game drama brought to you by robot girardi  #yankees
A orbit manages the New York yankees
Joe girardi is am asshole #cutcarpenter
@newkingofmedia managing by girardi
Only joe girardi could turn a laugher into a save situation.  #robot
Cut carpenter now #yankees
Carpenter is 95 totally middle of plate.  #meatball
@newkingofmedia I'd rather him cut.
Watch giradi manage this pig slop into a save situation
Bye bye shut out. #firegirardi.
Robot girardi doesn't believe in shutouts.  Pussification of America.
Somebody in the #yankees clubhouse has to call Gardner cue ball or kazoo.
I hope. The #yankees mustaches get so  fucking  sloppy long, that prep school pussy  Hal, has to call a press conference.
Ellsbury is hitting .362.  I still #firecashman
In order to walk around with your cap to the side like an asshole. Your stuff has to be ultra nasty.  #michaelpineda.
It's easy to tell the cocksuckers on the #yankees, they don't have mustaches
@jpf1562 I'll take your word lol
Gregorio petitis Stach is by far the best one #Yankees
DIDI with the hit. #savethebaseball
@jpf1562 I don't give @twitter nearly as much thought
@jpf1562 #probation,  my militant friend,
@jpf1562 u allowed me? Lol
@jpf1562 why can I never retweet u?  I don't get it
Red Sox being no hit.  Lol.
Ellsbury toying with @mlb
DIDI buys another week with me on that play.  #sweet #Yankees
Jacoby toying with baseball at this point.  #anotherstolenbase.
It's silly even trying to get jacoby ellsbury out these days.  #yankees.
@newkingofmedia but in any event #firecashman
Is there any dick head not doing the 80s porm star mustache thing on #yankees?  No way arods doing this.
@96liverpudlians better than mccant at half the price
#yankees let martin walk on a 2 year 17 mil deal.  #firecashman. He is as lost as beltran
Pineda could be a tight end in his spare time.  #yankees
Sweet pick, tex #Yankees
@ZeppieriTony no personality but 5 rings.  Give me rings all day long.
Beltran is lost.  #dfa
You know if jeter were in the clubhouse this god awful mustache game would not be going on. #YankeeNation #Yankees
This new guy Alex is pretty good.  #Yankees
Gardner just put a hitting clinic on.  Hope Beltran was watching.  #Yankees
Great at bat Gardner #yankees
#Tiger bronzed his man card banging porn stars 7 at a time, gave it all back today weeping that he can't sleep without Lindsey,
Tiger woods telling the world he can't sleep over his breakup ends his manhood. #TigerWoods
@BigBadWolf_1 it's to the point he is old and rich and doesn't care at all about the quality if the show.
@BigBadWolf_1 unlistenable
@nithyankees @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao 4 people will watch
I hate how defensive teams forget the fact that you still have to score to win.  #Rangers
@Angry_VBK team doesn't score, you can't win that way.  Big trouble this team is in.
Hanley in left field is hard to watch.  #RedSox are in trouble early.
@KPNYJ team goes as QB goes
Get yandle off the ice. #NYR
Sports is simple, you don't score you don't win.  #rangers are in trouble. #NYR
@BigBadWolf_1 @ZeppieriTony velarde?
Pedro's 99 K to BB ratio in 99 was 10 to 1 LOL think about that.
@BigBadWolf_1 @ZeppieriTony oh he was fun to beat and trust me I HATED him. But looking back he was very special.
@ZeppieriTony @BigBadWolf_1 @WFAN660 his change up was devistating.  98 mph at ur chin then 73 same exact motion.
@BigBadWolf_1 @ZeppieriTony 2000 217 IP 128 hits allowed.  32 walks 280 ks to all roided up hitters in a bandbox.  Best year ever.
@BigBadWolf_1 @ZeppieriTony @WFAN660 I was a little too young for 78.  But factor I'm everyone is on roids, 2000 best yr pitches ever #Pedro
Love how Pedro gets offended by talking about his mother. This maybe the best interview ever.  @WFAN660
@ZeppieriTony @BigBadWolf_1 @WFAN660 never saw anyone as dominate as Pedro
@BigBadWolf_1 @ZeppieriTony @WFAN660 1999 2000 numbers are crazy good.  Go look,  insane
@BigBadWolf_1 @WFAN660 heat of the moment.
Zimmer going after Pedro was simply classic.
@BigBadWolf_1 @WFAN660 I was outraged that day too but I've seen it 1000 times Pedro was playing defense vs Zimmer , classic moment
@BigBadWolf_1 @WFAN660 didn't exactly hit the guy
Francesa is must listen to radio right now.
Pedro is a class act. Can pitch for me anytime. @WFAN660
hated Pedro Martinez with a passion,but he also is the best pitcher I ever saw.  Esp in 1999.   numbers are other wordly.  Esp given the era
80 percent of the callers to @WFAN660 @BMonzoWFAN are complete morons.  #MongoNation
The #rangers despise 2 goal leads #nyr
#rangers need to bury the puck in the net every chance they get tonight.  #NYRvsWSH
#ageisjustnumber
@madbad this isn't on Farrell, this is the GM.  I think.  Starting staff is suspect at best.
@jwelge96 not even 1.  Strange strategy,
@nycajun1 @sullybaseball @Betances what the fuck for
The Pussification of America will force all of our kids to speak Chinese.
@chris_pr51 it's 15 pitches?  Pussification of America
@sullybaseball @nycajun1 @Betances why?
@Sir_otto18 because girardi is a pussy cultivator
Goose Gossage pitches 12 innings a week but @betances can't pitch 1 inning back to back nights?  #firegirardi
@96liverpudlians @Leekowalski ever
@Leekowalski @96liverpudlians 2004 bothers me 10,000 times more
Why is this robot fuck resting his bullets in fenway?  #firegirardi.
2004 still annoys me.
Mcant
@JetsAreGarbage Father Time is undefeated
@jwelge96 stupid.  They are in the game.  Warren didn't hit on purpose.
I would let DIDI pitch the 8th just so he can put it in hanleys temple.
Bullshit boston move.  Losers.
How does a guy as bad as DIDI is with the bat ever get into the majors?
Fuck you fat boy.  #Ortiz
Retiring the handsome Dustin pedroia is an awesome feeling.
Red Sox fans take classes to learn how to root for mookie betts.  #whitefanbase.
The only black allowed In Fenway is the edges around home plate.  #YankeesRedSox
@YankeesGalaxy I don't understand it.  Should be 12 percent black.  Mystifying.  Like they don't let em in.
My sons heaving throw up gags sounds better than James Taylor.
The fuckin mile doesn't work.  #blowupfenway.
John kruk dropping dead of a fat induced stroke would make this broadcast more interesting.  @espn
#letblacksintofenway.
Larry lucchino Is like I'll pay that day bastard Pablo Sandoval whatever he wants but I, not letting his kind but a ticket.  #bostonsucks.
Do black people root for the Red Sox?
Why are no black people ever in the stands at Fenway?  I don't get it.  #YankeesRedSox
Rogers could walk up and place it gently on a tee and get better results.
@jpf1562 @KPT7 I'm done
Get this cocksucker loser out of the game you fuck girardi
The robot in the dugout needs to wake up. #girardi
@jpf1562 @KPT7 zero chance here.  #BetancesTime #MillerTime
@KPT7 @jpf1562 fuck ur mother, I'm done w her she sucked,
Fenway fly all homer.  Tease these liberal boston fucks.  #bringinbetances.
#yankee bullpen means the #RedSox go to sleep.  #YankeesRedSox
Fuck you Hanley.  #anotherdomincansavage.  #RedSox paying the price for Pedro beanings a decade ago
David Ortiz is a fat sloppy Dominican savage with an impeccable PED pipeline.  #jerkoff.  #YankeesRedSox
Not going to get ahead of my self, but kicking the shit out if the #RedSox always feels great.  #YankeesRedSox #Yankees
@newkingofmedia we finally agree.  Asshole GM will need to make t#he right July moves.
@KPNYJ mike Macc and the bullpen have me in a good mood.  Still, #FireCashman tho.
@KPNYJ yes!!!
If whoever the #jet QB is , can manage games and not gift wrap them away, this team is winning 10 plus games.  #JETSBABY
The #yankees in first place and the #jets on the absolute correct trajectory.  #happyfan.
Here's why you have to believe in this #Yankees team, the rest of the American League sucks and their bullpen doesn't.  #SweepTheSox
Randolph crush huge over Chester,  what A winning weekend.  #joeybats.
@b_petty14 uses @twitter  more than u do.  Welcome to the #jets
Hooks won, #rangers won, #yankees won, #jets re engineered themselves.  #goodsaturday.
As usual nothing ever lives up to the hype.  #MannyvsMayweather
If I'm the #RedSox I don't want to waste too many well pitched games.  #YankeesRedSox
#mlb is going to require #Betances to record 5 outs an inning.  It's the only way it's going to be fair.  #Yankees #YankeesRedSox
Insurance run. Winning baseball. #Yankees
#BetancesTime #MILLERTIME and these Fenway shadows just aren't fair.  #YankeesRedSox
I'm amazed that Mariano in 96 got 5-6 outs routinely but Betances isn't asked to ever.  Girardi is a robot. #Yankees
Inter division girardi has to give the last nine outs to Betances and miller.  #Yankees
Fat pitch martin.  #Yankees
The #Yankees bullpen is just ridiculous.
Eovaldi is showing me something. #Yankees
@jwelge96 who was late for his own pro day..,, these guts crack me up.
Whose going to make the catastrophic mistake now?  #rangers.
@jwelge96 there's nothing I can say I don't like.  Steal a 3rd down scat back somewhere.
@jwelge96 interesting.
@jwelge96 did Hundley go?
Rangers suck, the defense sucks and the goalie sucks.  This is 9 min for the season
Hooks in a nail biter today, 4-1, too much big train James, 12 outs, 11 ks, Joey 2-4.  3-0.  #randolphlittleleague.
@jwelge96 Bryce thoughts?
Mike Macc is a god.  Love what he has done.
@drmtesta no idea.  But how much better than Powell is he?
@jpf1562 any good rbs left?
@drmtesta I wanted duke jognson.  At this point who are we getting better than Powell?  Roll the dice on QB
@drmtesta who?  Do you love anyone left?
The pick at 4 is #BrettHundley the diff between 4th and 5th round lineman is semantics.  Draft upside and hope. #JetsDraft #jetsnation
@jpf1562 diff between a 4th and a 5th round lineman is negligible.  Go get Hundley and hope it's a good guess
@jpf1562 get him.  It's pretty much guess work from here in in.  Guess on him, high upside.
The 4th round I want upside.  #BrettHundley forget blue collar Lineman.  #JetsDraft #JetsFam
Bring me the bruin.  #BrettHundley #Jets
Ultimate Lorenzo Mauldin Highlights | HD I'm already a big Lorenzo  fan.  Plays with fire.   
@jwelge96 yes he will play up some,crunching guys.  I agree has to be better.
@isaacfromCT lol I just checked lol felt like 10 years was lost.  Still 20 is a long time ago
@isaacfromCT how is that 30 years ago
@jwelge96 take it.  Just Pryor and browning neagal disappointed
@FranksYanks23 must win.  This is 98 yanks game 4 in cleavlsnd down 2-1 must win.
@Eddie_YN26 he would need development, but we need someone
@Eddie_YN26 I  want this kid.
@jwelge96 hadn't read it.  Good for him.  But can he play?  I like Louisville basketball players myself.
Brett Hundley come on down.  #JetsDraft
@jwelge96 you think Hundley?
@jwelge96 they don't need him underneath.
Devin Smith 2014 Highlights ᴴᴰ -Deep Threat- anyone doubting the #jets 2nd pick needs to watch this

@Matt_DAgostino3 @Disable_MMi @Patterson_NFL didnt realize that
Without question, je ne se quoi is a top 5 favorite word for me.  I try to use it once a day. Lol say it, you'll love it.
@Matt_DAgostino3 @Disable_MMi @Patterson_NFL well if he is cleared of all charges, he will get paid somewhere.
Hooks at 11, derby, draft, yanks, rangers, fight.  #sportscornacopia.
My dog whose rather large treats my feet like a mattress.  #jettlove
@Disable_MMi @Patterson_NFL def is.
@SpyroKush still preferred beckham green
@Patterson_NFL @Disable_MMi I think that's smart, if he didn't kill the girl, clear it up make millions afterwards.
@Disable_MMi @Patterson_NFL going to clear his legal issues and prob be a first rounder next year
@Disable_MMi @Patterson_NFL Collins is withdrawing from draft because he wasn't picked in the first 3 rounds.
@RandyGregory_4 @nithyankees put down the herb.
@jpf1562 fuck these new stats.  Use eyeballs
Brett Hundley or duke Johnson next.  #JetsDraft
@emesola thinking same.
It's really weird being an optimistic #jet fan I must admit.
@jwelge96 a lot.
Finally offense #jets #believeinmikemacc
@jwelge96 I'll take it.  I trust him.
Alabama DBS just say no.  #deemilliner
@FranksYanks23 which pick they take?
@ChrisScandaglia nope
@ChrisScandaglia benches arod for Garrett jones.  Lefty righty non sense
Girardi over thinks.
@FranksYanks23 love that guy
@nate2usmc the pot I'm fine with, the throwing the woman down the stairs is crazy.  Keep him away from the flight crew he will be fine.
@nate2usmc they say top 10 talent without issues, that's not hill.
All star WRs are diva headaches.  I want mine to to 6'6".  #DBeckhamgreen  #jets #JetsNation #NFLDraft2015
@ZazzyJets burn the flags roll the dice.
@jpf1562 sort of the way I feel about white and geno.  They got a blue chipper and Wilkerson can be traded.
It's funny how in the blink of an eye the mets are bad again.  #15minutesareover.
@drmtesta agree
Dorial beckham green. Can't teach 6 foot 6.  #jets #roundtwo
Wilkerson for a 2 and a 3.  Get ER' done mike Macc #jets
@jwelge96 I think he next move is to trade Wilkerson.  Like mo but he wants game wrecking money and he just isn't that player.
@jpf1562 I'm a jet fan, I'm never happy.
@jpf1562 I'd say not happy, just more optimistic
@jpf1562 if they passed on megatron I'm mad.  I read white is a great athlete running sloppy routes and geno can hit him anyway.
@jpf1562 can play end too, best defensive guy in the draft and the WR is not megatron.  Get jelan strong in 2nd and I'm happy.
When nobody is open, and the tsunami of a D line comes at Brady, how effective will he be?  #Jets #dethroneuggsboy.
If you don't have the QB to take over games, you might as well out together a defensive that takes opposing QB out of games.  #jets #defense
@arcaderehab Jealen strong nxt.  WR az state.
If it were cooper vs williams I draft need.  Williams vs white, the #jets chose right.  At least on paper in my mind.  #JetsNation
@seeburn2 I don't think k you can trust the Baylor offense translating to nfl.  I think it's Hundley but who knows
The more I read on Williams and the more I read how unpolished white is on route running, the more I like the #jets selection. #JetsNation
@jwelge96 the more I read about williams the more I like the puck.
@jwelge96 I think strongs the guy.  I'd be happy with that.
Give me strong and Hundley next 2 picks.  #jets
@jwelge96 I can see the Lsu OL too
@jwelge96 yes this must be an impact offensive guy.
Gregory , strong or duke Johnson will be the #Jets #2 pick #NFLDraft2015
@RobTheYankee when hex stops looking for 20 mil a year
@jwelge96 this is like drafting a great slap hitter and bunt guy in year 5 of the live ball era.
@jwelge96 you win scoring 35 points just the facts of the new nfl.
@jwelge96 exactly.
@prfinestpapi125 yes burner.
Another draft where the league loves WRs the jets pass.
Why is Gregory still. On board?  Did he snort coke off a hookers ass last night? #NFLDraft2015
@nate2usmc white was the guy
@nate2usmc good value but it's not what they needed.
@nate2usmc lol 6-3 with revis and cro in backfield lol
Make someone pay a ransom for Wilkerson.  Nice player, not a game wrecker.  Go to work mike Macc.
@Mike_Randazzo34 1000 Percent agree.  Phony LA where nobody cares about anything is much louder.
@FranksYanks23 totally agree.  And it's very possible
Bowles has to go 4-3 right?  The whole team is DE's. #jets
@FranksYanks23 I, no gonna kill him.  But you stop that that last one,
@AndersonEd27 totall agree .  Wall Street goes now.
@emesola only diff is Pitts wins rings.
It's funny #MadisonSquareGarden gets the great rep but these other buildings are much louder and crazier.
If lundquist wants to be king, he must stop that puck
Marty is still in the league right?  Haven't seen him.  #Rangers
@JJSearle94 maybe.  Rangers have similar plight, just not as brutal
@JJSearle94 if they lose sat it's over
@JJSearle94 one crushing loss, they lose Saturday
Does Rick Nash still play on the #Rangers
@FranksYanks23 nope.  Same old story with that guy
@FranksYanks23 nope.  Big trouble
Season. Turning loss.  #NYR
@FranksYanks23 this is awful
That's on lundquist
#nyr season just died
The #rangers and #MadisonSquareGarden have awoken
#rangers are atrocious tonight.  #NYRvsWSH
@nate2usmc I like pick the value, but he doesn't help geno
@john_zsoldos horrendous
Someone tell the #rangers round 2 started tonight.
@jpf1562 nothing that troll does surprises me.
@jpf1562 your lying right?
@jpf1562 lol
@Rob4882 you obviously miss the point
Williams to the #jets is like he #yankees adding another Gardner/ellsbury clone.
In an offensive league, the #jets add to their overwhelming strength #sameoldjets
By bye Wilkerson.
Def trade.  #delay
If Rex was here he would be hand jobbing Williams alread #jets
There's no way they take Williams
They better not take Williams.  Trade the pick.  #jets
@jpf1562 #SOJ
Jets do not need Williams.  Trade the big, rob someone get an edge rusher later
@jwelge96 hold a team up.  Have other needs
@jwelge96 trade him.  They don't need him
#jets now in great shape TRADE THE PICK
#jets must trade the pick trade the fucking pick
White or trade the pick. #jets
Trade the pick.  #jets
@jwelge96 and half of twitter was rooting for wins.
#jets get hot in December to miss the blue chippers. Nothing ever changes
@prfinestpapi125 white.  Need explosiveness
This is why you don't root for the 4th win in December you fucking assholes.  #Jets
#jets trade the fucking pick.  Blue chippers gone.  Happy December wins
Jets need to trade down.
@VicSanityX 1000 percent agree
Jets draft rangers hockey.  I may break @twitter tonight.
@RobTheYankee OJ top 5 for sure.  Ran like a horse before he lost his mind
@RobTheYankee went in 85 with OJ I hi I
@RobTheYankee oh yes, all time great
@RobTheYankee rodger staubach
@FranksYanks23 I give Beltran 2 more weeks.  They cannot go the soriano route for 400 abs
@TPatelmo games changed, they have not.
@arcaderehab possibly.  Get an edge rusher at 15
@FranksYanks23 were already contending tho.
@FranksYanks23 good point.
@TPatelmo amaro is lost.  I hate my GM too tho.
@arcaderehab geno steps a lil forward.  Decker Marshall, white Kerley amaro, ivory Ridley wins 10 games.  With that D
@FranksYanks23 really, why?
@arcaderehab they are win now.   See no chance they go mariota.  Cooper will be gone
It's about time for the cole hamels to the #yankees talk starting to heat up.
@arcaderehab who do you want at 6?  I think the defense has enough. Get me explosiveness.  For once.
With the 6th pick in the #NFLDraft2015 the #jets select jimbo Johnson, long snapper, the citadel.  Watch!!!!!! Lol #soj
@prfinestpapi125 lol
Mike Macc has my confidence,  just a gut feel.  #jets #JetsDraft #jetsnation #JetsFamily
@bigjfreak123 hence my fantasy
Hundley
White, Ray, Huntley.  My #jets fantasy first three picks.
@jwelge96 @hippieLemonade white, ray, hundley first 3 rounds is my fantasy draft.
@jwelge96 @hippieLemonade you and me think so alike.  I'm all in on white.  Ray would be a dream sinario
So my son tells me he discovered this great scent called eternity for men.  I was like that's so 1991.  He didn't believe me.
Have zero prob with the #jets taking WR kevin white.  The defense has enough and we will get to the QB with Bowles blitzing every other down
Great sports day.  #rangers game 1 and the #nfl guessing game   Aka #NFLDraft
@NYGreenMachine @nyjets I think they go edge rusher
#jets at picking @dantefowler at 6 #NFLDraft2015
Looking forward to the #nfl annual day of guessing.  #Draft2015
@ShitDadsDo @caitlinviespoli hell yes, every day
Canadians in 7 rangers in 6
#StanleyCupPlayoffs
If I have to watch anything it's @FoxNews but them putting mark furman on the #BaltimoreRiots means they dont give 2 fucks about anything.
@titanmateo buddy of mine knows the jet WR coach says they have no interest in mariota.  But who knows
@titanmateo I think eagles.  Chip is crazy and in charge and I says he give you a mountain for the 2
@titanmateo the rivers deal I don't get?  Do the titans have enough to win now?  I can see the moving it for loads or picks
@titanmateo who you guys taking?  You think they are def trading it?
@titanmateo lol
Fuckiny shifts
“@NickM538: 660. Now.”
@jpf1562 lol guys lost
@jpf1562 never happen
@BigBadWolf_1 never happen
For shits and giggles and to prove a point the police should vacate #Baltimore today, totally leave. The city cannibolizes itself in 48 hrs.
@dj73104 not at all.
@dj73104 I love michael jorden, I love ray Charles, I love kevin hart, I love @nate2usmc I just hate non productive murderous savages.
@dj73104 no I'm all about the love, ask @nam4b
Wouldn't is be totally ironic If they filmed Albert belle torching a car?  #baltimorethugs
@dj73104 ok substitute the words savages.  Fits better anyway
Wanna blow up your mentions?  Comment on a woman's weight, or call out liberals.  #kaboom
@nate2usmc this is why I love u
1 percent of the nationwide police force are bad.  100% of the #bloods #Crips are murderous thugs.  Pick a side.  #BaltimoreRiots
@FranksYanks23 unreal.  I'm seriously amazed he survived.
When they decide to blow up #Baltimore make sure they fly in all the liberals defending the #bloods &amp; #Crips first.  #BaltimoreRiots
@pstrif my fav are the libs defending the bloods
@madbad not a person in England understands that reference.  Lol
@pstrif fuck em all
@newkingofmedia kill em all
@newkingofmedia cops vs bloods I choose cops everytime.  Even the crooked ones.  Sorry.
Hanley Ramirez looks as comfortable in left as I would competing in the Olympic men's figure skating competition.  #triplesowkow.
Gossage used to throw 3 innings 3 times a week, now Betances can't throw 20 pitches twice in a row.Baseball plyrs are worlds biggest pussies
When rioting breaks out in downtown Greenwich ct, I'll change my mind about the nature &amp;origin of societies savages. Until then, kill em all
No the #nationals won't lose till June.  #thatsbaseballsuyzan
@stvngbsn @mikev1975 she would punt you 35 yards. Big girl.
@mikev1975 shit I forgot we traded him
Michael Kay's head is bigger than the tire hanging on the back of my jeep. #YANKSonYES
Tanaka will get the surgery mid summer, come back 2017 ,dominate, then opt out.  #firecashman
Bring david cone back!!!!!!   He will just throw from 43 arm slots and get outs.  #Yankees
@jwelge96 just in time to opt out.
Does manny bunelos walk this planet?  #yankees
@jpf1562 @VamosYankees his act def wears out, but he transforms losers, that is for sure.
@VamosYankees @jpf1562 but he takes over 100 loss teams and wins 90.  A lot to be said for that.
@ChrisScandaglia I'm a Kim guy.
@jpf1562 @VamosYankees I do always point out as McDowell was asked to do something he never does, Mariano rotted in the pen.
This will sound awful, but, merideth marokovickh can def catch in a major league game in a pinch.  The perfect catchers frame.  #yesnetwork
@jpf1562 @VamosYankees yes but buck has won everywhere and always started with awful teams.
#itsnotwhatyouwant. #Tanaka
I won't take the Red Sox seriously until they trade for cole hamels.  Arms are terrible.
@jpf1562 @VamosYankees most overrated ringless coach in organized sports.
Ellsbury isn't even worth half the 153 they are paying him, but he is a winning ballplayer.  #Yankees
#StartSpreadingTheNews #yankeeswin.
I'm amazed at the money pitchers get.  Nobody stays healthy and nobody is dominate for more than 4 years anymore.
If the #yankees weren't playing the triple a @RaysBaseball , miller would be in the game.  Girardi better be right.
#MLB should allow the #Yankee opponents the option to forfeit the game after 7 innings. we have a lead, games over. Early start on dinner.
It's very odd rooting for the "lil engine that could" #yankees, but I like it.
@LondonCal_Lin I worry about yankees but swim in happiness at Red Sox problems.
@rangerfan014 very weird mid game
Big pitch #Rodgers
@FranksYanks23 this is over.  Gaurenteed.
Bye bye tanaka #Yankees
Clay buchholtz may be the worst pitcher with the best stuff in the history of baseball.  #RedSoxNation
Tickets to the game are $9000, beat traffic, and go to @miami13mike in east hanover nj.  as much fun as being there.  #letsgorangers
Shane Ray falling into the second round is just the draftnicks doing mushrooms early this morning.  #NFLDraft2015
Three cars are burning in #Baltimore the fucking media jerks off the world off.  #BaltimoreRiots
The next time I'm pissed off I'm going to burn down the community I live in.  Stupid non-evolved mother fucking #savages #BaltimoreRiots
Truth be told outside if #CamdenYards #Baltimore is a shit hole.  Let it burn.
@pstrif @OrdioMongo @SimonTSN690 @PeterBotte just shoot the puck.  11 is inexcusable
The Matt Williams watch is on correct?  #nationals.
@mbrogz13 absolutely I gave up at 3-6
@pstrif habs rags
@pstrif hope so.
#Yankees bullpen is phenominal.
@pstrif going to be a good series.
11 shots in game 7. Funny.  #Islanders
@FranksYanks23 rangers in  6
Rangers in 6.  #rangers #capitals
Bye bye islanders.  Fuck you too.
How did they not pull hailok?
Iskander  pp is a mess
What a dumb penalty.  #capitals
I'd piss myself if they burned a Popeyes chicken joint in #BaltimoreRiots #ironictwists get me everytime.
The #Stanleycup tournament of 4 rounds of 7 games just proves how fucking stupid the Super Bowl actually is.
@jwelge96 back end is a treat.
@LondonCal_Lin blind squirrels get nuts sometimes and Red Sox get outs sometimes  Same exact theory.
In the history of the world, a productive, useful, employed person has never burned a church for the fuck of it.  #baltimoreriots
Rioting always works. Look at the Mecca south central has become.  #savagesneverlearn
I watch #Yankees games for the Betances &amp; miller show.
If the #Baltimore riot folks were all at work, nothing would burn.  #solutions.  #BaltimoreRiots
@MichaelPacholek @beoutmuhhfugg they are too busy on boats.  Yes the church burning is helping Baltimore tremendously.
Amazing how nobody ever burns a church in Newport Rhode Island or Beverly Hills.  Savages.  #BaltimoreRiots
#Baltimore is now burning churches.  Savages.
Hooks rolling.  15-5.  2-0, 33 runs in 2 games.  Too much Rocco too much big James.  Joey leading off scoring 2 runs at a time #randolphLL

Pick your ass up...

And surprise a few motherfuckers.
@KPNYJ or Shane Greene was here
I want the #Islanders game to go to 33 OTS.  Don't even care who wins.  #nyr.
The #yankees even have me compelled to watch, especially after the 6th inning.  #betances #MillerTime
@jpf1562 like lefties too.  Bullpen is solid and the one thing manager does very well is manage a bullpen.Some Heath and luck never know
And the Red Sox should see if tom Brady can pitch.
More so than any other time since 1996, #yankee baseball games are 6 Inning affairs.  They lead by then, games over.  #betances #miller.
@ggonzalez03 @RaysBaseball will be fun
@ggonzalez03 @RaysBaseball both teams will compete.  Sept will be fun
Now the #Yankeees fatten up on @RaysBaseball
Red Sox holding pitching try outs tomorrow.
#yankees competing with the #mets in the same city is like me competing with a guy with a heated ice cream truck #subwayseries2015
Met fans blaming arod everywhere.
I love it.  @WFAN660 tomorrow met fans will bail out of this bandwagon as if it's on fucking fire.  I will listen and laugh all day.
Click.  I wouldn't watch #sportscenter if my right nut depended on it.
Ope from Mayberry has a better shot than john.  #MILLERTIME
That is 1 #MillerTime
I'm on fucking fire tonight.  #twitterrants
If you have to put an orange slice in a beer you absolutely know you just brewed fresh cat piss.  @BlueMoonBrewCo
Campbell Flores muno vs miller seriously is unfair.  Poor mets.  #backtoreality.
I'd trade Beltran right now for better infield grates for the YMCA guys.
Met pitchers got a babushka on.  Only the mets.
@Sportschic80 yep
Why does the met pitcher have a halo on his head?
@bigjfreak123 cause they at on.  Follow me I won't mention until sept.  I care less.
So here's what we learned about the mets.  T
Matt Harvey is top 5. Rest of the team is .500 .515 ball club.  #SubwaySeries
@bigjfreak123 I have zero met hate.  Just expected more.  I knew Harvey was great, expected to see more so did everybody.
@bigjfreak123 I don't care even a little.  I just thought they were better.  They are not.
Betances will just get 4 ks #Yankees
Dear met fans, miller is better than Betances,  #SubwaySeries
@bigjfreak123 not at all but Yankee fans know we aren't great, met fans were losing their minds last week.  It's a 83-85win team.
Betances isn't fair.
Good morning ....good afternoon ........goodnight.  #betances
The 14 win mets team about to go against buzz saws.  #betances #miller welcome back to shitty reality met fans.  #SubwaySeries #Yankees
@JSC2100 the kid can def pick it in center.
@newkingofmedia managers too robotic for that creativity
Fuck the @espn mikes are back. Fuck me
@ZeppieriTony still
Before the #mets take over the city, they may want to go to "catch the ball" school.  Harvey degrom and the 23 stooges.
I'm dying to see granderson vs miller.  I bet anyone 4 to 1 he smiles that big Curtis smile, forfeits the at bat, and stays in dugout.
@ionized4091 she freaks me out.
The mets wouldn't win the college world series with that pig slop middle infield.  Daniel Murphy is the best DH in the national league.
@emarin671 @WhitePplVideos great video
500 more painful Stephen Drew at bats.  #Yankees
Drew doesn't hit Phil rizzutos weight.  #firecashman #deplorable.
“@WhitePplVideos: Try explaining this to your boss 
@ggonzalez03 I hear ya.  But this team is in rough shape.
Timo p, Castillo and now Campbell.  The New York metropolitans #SubwaySeries
Mets are and always will be a complete joke of a franchise lol
#mets. Lolololololololololoooolololololoolol
The mets are a complete joke
Sweet play Drew.
The mets have 67 diff uniform combos.  #rapingfans.
Remember when the #yankees had relievers come into the game in Toyota celicas?  Holy fucking shit how dumb.  #70s
@rangerfan014 awful.  It's a  mirage.
Mets fans are tumbling and crashing back to earth.  Besides the 2 young guns, this team is fucking awful.  #universerestored
Only shit the @Mets suck
This #SubwaySeries game will end Tuesday afternoon.
Daniel Murphy's hands are made of steel.  What an awful fielder.  #mets #SubwaySeries
Kruk and schilling are breaking bad broadcasting records.  #ESPN #SundayNightBaseball
I can't take girardi.
Stop with the fucking bunts
Now If only garder knew how to steal a base
@ZeppieriTony I love miller
@ZeppieriTony @espn agree, but it was listenable
watched baseball for 30 years, 56 zillion innings.  Why the fuck does #espn think I don't know what a strike is?  Get rid of this dumb box
@fakeliampayne2 or the stupid strike zone box
I'm convinced the @espn executive that decides john kruk has on air talent is deaf.  #SundayNightBaseball
Whoever this lefty is, he just soiled himself.  Nice move joe.  #Yankees
Giradi just sent a memo to cashman with this early hook.  #fuckyouboss.  #Yankees #SubwaySeries #firecashman #EovaldiSucks
Is teixera even trying in the field now that he us hitting?
#Yankees run prevention.  #firecashman
Eovaldi looks a little too much like that Pussy Carl pavano for my liking.  #Yankees #firecashman
@JSC2100 lol
Cashman should sign Drew to a lifetime contract.#firecashman
@JSC2100 #firecashman
I'm more excited when jr Murphy is up rather than Brian McCann
Eovaldi is 25 throws 100 mph and is on his 3rd organization.  You know that means he is as dumb as a box of rocks.  #Yankees
@newkingofmedia dumb pitcher.
Eovaldi Absolutely owns the dead center of home plate. #firecashman
More mets batting practice after these messages.  #EovaldiSucks
So when does all of #yankeetwitter all come to a unanimous decision on the fact that Carlos Beltran is done,
Next inning eovaldi should walk 60 feet to home plate, gently place a ball on a tee and step away.  Can't be worse.  #Yankees #SubwaySeries
When you trade for the NL hits allowed leader, this us what you get.  #eovaldi #yankees
Tie game.  #yankees
@SluggerBro without a doubt
Stop with the boob cream retweets. Enough.
Love the fact that the game is 8 pm tonight.  #SubwaySeries I'll actually see the game. #yankees
@timtomMA yankees very much same way.  It's a conglomerate not a baseball club.
4 days till the #jets draft.  It's been forever since I did a #jetstwitter rant.
@ogdiamond15 we shall see,  that met lineup scares nobody.
Its never too late to be the person you might have been.  #dontgiveup
Would love to see eovaldi shut the mets down today and restore order in the universe.  #Yankees
@timtomMA good point.  Like the Yankee teams of the past 6 years.
@timtomMA it's the rotation.  Hard to not be.  Strange strategy.  Esp when pitching won 3 titles in a decade.
The AL east is as mediocre as we all knew it would be.  Anyone wins it.  Maybe not tampa.
Stay classy #Baltimore
@pstrif Tavares is legit.
Opening day, 15-0 , Joey on base 5 times, Rocco, big train James way too much.  #randolphlittleleague. #OpeningDay
@pstrif I take no series lightly
I hope the game 7 #Islanders #Capitals game goes to 13 OTS #nyr.
I'm all over hank, but the king played great #NYRPlayoffs
Absolutely love the work ethic of the #NYRangers.  Onto #round2
This is the year. #nyr. #BecauseItsTheCup
Hags money #rangers win
@LondonCal_Lin and I'm always in the mood to spank the mets and the Red Sox
@LondonCal_Lin always love them but I'm critical.
Whoever thought the #mets streak wasn't ending tonight in the Bronx to the #Yankees, then u just don't know the natural laws of the universe
Met fans meet reality.
@jwelge96 lol
I was going on the premise that mark teixera was totally useless.  I may have to re think.  #yankees
@nate2usmc @MetsGM this is true
@nate2usmc @MetsGM the mets will always be the red headed step child.
Dear met fans, not so fast.  #fuckyourselves. #SubwaySeries2015
Met fans can think whatever they want, that line up bloooooows #SubwaySeries2015
@FranksYanks23 let's go #nyr
The two intermissions really help my baseball night.  #rangers #SubwaySeries
@FranksYanks23 jacoby went from 5 homers to 35.  That's not accidental.
@FranksYanks23 if he takes roids maybe.
I'm a baseball guy at heart, but I'll watch more hockey tonight.  #rangers
@LondonCal_Lin I'm too old to be uncomfortable
@FranksYanks23 what's ellsbury?  .285 8 homers 90 runs scored?  You can find that.  Agree better than legares but not dollar for dollar
@FranksYanks23 defensively on par.
@LondonCal_Lin hell no.  45 degrees.
@FranksYanks23 not yet.  I'm not an ellsbury guy.  Nice player, perhaps most over paid in game,
@FranksYanks23 I'd rather have legares and 145 million to buy another player.  That's the whole issue.
#rangers have to drop the hammer.
@jwelge96 I like ken singleton too
Can you imagine joe Torres stress level the day before the 2000 World Series?  Boss must have never let the guy breath.
@jwelge96 George stopped that last minute.
David cone was one of my fav pitchers to watch.  Crafty, smart, guts.
@FranksYanks23 I get scared they hang close in july and the midget trades the farm for ken phelps.  I really want the kids up.
Bernie has a grammy and several rings?  Whose better than him? Ok ok ok. Jeter, but nobody else.
@twitter would not have survived the 2000 World Series.  #yankees #mets #SubwaySeries2015
Is t it funny now that Hannah Davis is literally everywhere?  #thejetereffect.
@LondonCal_Lin strap in.  #SubwaySeries
have zero met hate. even stop what I'm doing to watch Harvey pitch.  Mets won't catch the #yankees in the next 300 yrs. I'm fine w them good
#rangers seize the day tonight and get a mini 
Vacation.  4-2.  #BecauseItsTheCup #StanleyCup #NYR #NYRHockeyHouse
@FranksYanks23 but u are right w original point.  They played w guts.  A week ago I was looking at 90 losses.
@FranksYanks23 agree d rob miller would be a splurge.  if they did it, they could win it all.Now it's a cute story.The lil engine that could
@FranksYanks23 tanaka, Pineda, Greene, Betances miller d rob. Can win a ring.
@FranksYanks23 I wanted all three in the pen using the royals model.
Mariano, jeter, Bernie is the top three order of the #Yankees dynasty.  Forget that core 4 bulllshit.
Say what you want about Bernie.  If he was going well, the yankees were going well.  Third most important #yankee of the dynasty.
@FranksYanks23 I wanna see them hang tough, develop the kids and turn this thing over.
@FranksYanks23 I'm encouraged.  Greene, prado, d rob and they can win 95.  In other words the anti cashman plan would be gold right now.
Ran into al Leiter in a pizzeria on the jersey shore.  As good a guy as you think he us.
@FranksYanks23 DIDI isn't gonna make June. He is awful.
@FranksYanks23 ridiculous.  Although I love Bernie
Went my entire life thinking I was a dog person.  Then I got the fucker that proved I was full of shit all these years.  #jett.
The #yankees are such a corp.  a logo for Bernie Williams day?  Really!
@raylewisrules  think so
@davetheflashguy million percent with you.
@nate2usmc told you your my hero
42 fucked up degrees.  I don't get it.
@Chrismatic3000 it's perfect.  #timelessmusic
@Chrismatic3000 lol ha
@Chrismatic3000 fucking magnificent work!!!!!
Really want the rangers to take the easy road and do this in 5.
Do you think bill withers realky knows? Lol not one follower will Get the reference, prizes to someone that does.  #MUSICFRIDAY
The first huge sports Friday night of 2015.  I love these.  #NYR #SubwaySeries #yankees #TGIF
@titanmateo scary good
The @NHLBlackhawks are crazy good.
#Predators #Blackhawks game is off the hook. #StanleyCupPlayoffs
Big time #RedWings choke job
Seriously, fuck the @NYIslanders
April 23 37 degrees.  Fucking ridiculous.
@SamanthaJelly mystery
Islanders sloppy.
Islanders up against it tonight.
#Yankees showing a pulse.  I'm happy.  Still #FireCashman
@Angry_VBK totally agree
@Angry_VBK in white plains.
April 23 fucking snow flurries.
Worst drive  ever.
A smelly shit flicking oangatang in a night club scores more than the #Yankees do
Girardi with 5 straight lefties up.  Masterful managing.
@FranksYanks23 @MichaelPawluk @MoRings42 #FireCashman
@NFLguy07840 what a game, were screwed tomorrow
Bye bye @PredsNHL
@HavAnotherDonut pp looks dreadful
@HavAnotherDonut that's hystericle
@newkingofmedia did you really think an RBI can be recorded on an error?  No right, you were high right?
@HavAnotherDonut I agree
@HavAnotherDonut good point but that was a softie
#halock stinks
Islanders just lost this series IMO
Brian mc can't
Lol #2015yankees
@NFLguy07840 islanders.  Caps are enormous
Martins 15 minutes are officially up.  #yankees
@newkingofmedia @YankeeSource and I was mer positive when they put a quality product on the field.
@newkingofmedia @YankeeSource your now celebrating RBI stats?  Lol
@newkingofmedia @YankeeSource dude cannot be se
@YankeeSource was hit right at him
@YankeeSource error
Extra hockey #caps #Isles
Cashman put 200 million into the same player and they both won't total 25 homers playing in same outfield #FireCashman  proof he has no clue
April 24 153 million dollar man zero rbis.  Hard to do.  #jacoby #overpaid #FireCashman
Cashman paid ellsbury 100 million more than he is worth.  Gardner is better.  #FireCashman
@KPNYJ maybe.  I do hope,
Jim spencer, lol I'm old as fuck.
All the old Yankee numbers are out #31 #30 #14 #12 ( jim spencer). Who remembers him?
@newkingofmedia also a dumb deal.  But Pablo can at least hit.
If Drew ever hit .225 cashman would sign him to a lifetime personal services contract.
Chase headley 4 years 50 million.  I'll never get it.  #FireCashman
@FranksYanks23 not with cashman in charge.....
The hysterics over the #NFLScheduleRelease just goes to show that too many people have literally zero going on in their lives.  #scary
@FranksYanks23 amazing what happens when you strip it down and grow some young talent.
John Taveras is spectacular.
3-0 turn him loose.  Fire girardi.
@pstrif not a great power play tonight
Nassau colosseum right now is a mad house #Islanders
If Drew hit his weight I'd despise him less.  #yankees.  #FireCashman
I'm extra grumpy tonight.
Stop following the fucking so called leader you assholes !!!! Stop with the fucking shifts that never work saber metric cock suckers #yanks
Stop with the fucking shifts.  Won 27 titles without them #fireveryone. #Yankees #fuckcashman
@LondonCal_Lin and 10,000 percent accurate.
@LondonCal_Lin ugh your killin me.  With your staff of #4s lol
#Yankees sign d rob, keep prado and Greene  (aka the anti cashman plan). They are actually a good team.  #FireCashman #now
@LondonCal_Lin nice player not worth the money. Take him back
In other words, #FireCashman
Jacoby ellsbury is the worst overbuy in #Yankees history. At least they show up to watch other bad contracts.  Who shows up for jacoby?
#BryanPrice being overwhelmed by the tiny @Reds media throng is a fireable offense.
@JoeandEvan @DesBieler what a joke price is.  The media is supposed to help him hide injuries?  Should be fired today.
#BryanPrice not being able to handle the 3 beat reporters in Cincy is laughable. he were in NY wouldn't survive the subway ride to 1st game
That #Winnipeg building is  nuts right now
@jcrasnick @PattyWhite_NYM but Lou won
@NeilKeefe terrible contract
I'm happier about the #rangers road warrior mentality than I am about home Ice thruout. #NYRBelieve2015
@arcaderehab with rivers it's a 10 win team. Solid contender.
@arcaderehab mariota is there at 6 do they take him?
@arcaderehab they like the kid from Lsu
@NFLguy07840 clearly.
There maybe a homocide  on the ice in the #Vancouver #Winnipeg game. #StanleyCupPlayoffs
The white out in #Winnipeg is fucking crazy.  #StanleyCupPlayoffs
#rangers make habit of winning these close games.
Dan girardi played out of his mind tonight.  #NYRangers
Big W. #NYRangers
@arcaderehab Any articles on this?
Fuck you Crosby. your mother too. #NYRangers
@BigBadWolf_1 @JSC2100 I don't like either player nor thier ceiling
OT matter of time.  #nyr
@JSC2100 @BigBadWolf_1 cashman got DIDI and Evoldi just so he could tell his clueless boss he got younger.Neither player passes eyeball test
The #Rangers never score that back breaking goal.
Leave it to the king to make this a nail biter.  #nyr
@arcaderehab for what pick?
@JSC2100 @BigBadWolf_1 dies nothing well
@arcaderehab I heard this 2 weeks ago, is it picking up steam?  Absolutely want him.
@BigBadWolf_1 @JSC2100 love iglasuis silky smooth
@arcaderehab really? Seriously?
DIDI base hit.!!!!!!!!!!My dog just fucked my cat and tomorrow is Sunday.  #twilightzone. #Yankees
#firegirardi
DIDI is the first full time mlb player I've ever seen that does nothing right.  I bet somebody dresses him before games.  #Yankees
@pinstripechic single a confuses me
@newkingofmedia horrendous baseball player.  Traded for a 26 year old 2-3.  #assisnatecashman
312lb Luis sojo at 50 would be better than DIDI dodo.  #FireCashman
A mannaquin dressed like jeter is more effective than DIDI disasterous is at SS .  #Yankees #FireCashman
DIDI disasterous when does this experiment end?  #FireCashman
Even I have to be happy with the first two periods and everybody knows that's very hard for me #NYR
Good first period. #NYRangers
@LondonCal_Lin didn't we all?
I'm all for equality in the gym but a fucking guy can't get within 20 feet of a squat rack any more.  #modernproblems
@LondonCal_Lin psycho paths on skates going 25 mph in a game I've never played.  Football baseball.whole diff realm.
@LondonCal_Lin I'm actually semi sane w the rangers.
Fleury has out played henrik without a defense in front of him.  It's time for the king to put up or sit the fuck down.  #NYRvsPIT #NYR
@FranksYanks23 I'm going to watch the game at an out patient mental clinic.  Come.
#Rangers lose game 3 they they better staff the suicide hotlines properly tonight.  #StanleyCupPlayoffs #NYR
I'm at the intersection of frustration and a lack of sleep.  #HappyMonday
I'm so stupid somethimes.
@nate2usmc iffy on that test.  Lol
@FranksYanks23 pitched very well
@PattyWhite_NYM good point,but once I'd like to avoid game 7, law of averages says they are losing the next 1 they play
worry like crazy, but my kids needs to go on to be front line fighting marines.They are the 2 most destructive fuckers of their generation
@FranksYanks23 all I'm saying is you need crazy good goaltending g to win, and hank is usually average this time of year.
@FinalFrontier37 @BrianCoz he will triple cover him to prove a stupid point.  Marshall and decker will run free.  That's Rex.
Say whatever you want, henrik rarely stands on his hard in the playoffs.  #NYRangers
@FranksYanks23 pens are a team you want to keep sleeping.  They are now awake.
The #rangers can't stand commanding positions.  Always go the hard route.  #bestof5
#rangers seize control today.  #NYR #StanleyCupPlayoffs
@drmtesta adorable.  Hopefully jets win in her lifetime.  Cause you and I are screwed.
@drmtesta they are 9 and almost 14.  Non stop on the go. Lots if fun.  Ball games 2-3 times a day. Ur in for a treat. If Ellie goes easy lol
@drmtesta 2 boys.  Baby girl god bless u.  I got nothin for u.  Lol
@drmtesta wait till that lil cutie hits 14.  You will pull your hair out.
@madbad 1 of the greatest RD stories of all time.  You looked at me and asked me to move a parked car.  When I didn't move you attempted it.
Ever admit to yourself you have no idea what the fuck your doing with these kids? I Can barely manage my own ass.  Lol #randomthoughts
Baseball weekend non stop.  #finally #playball.
@PrivysTake @DIRECTV no t at all
@PrivysTake @DIRECTV yeah sure.  She needs to bang sheiks 4 at a time to match his income.
I knew the kris Bryant gf tweet would make woman hystericle.  #shootingfishinabarrel
@almostrachael 6 weeks.  Kris is in a new league.  Save this tweet
@KPT7 @DIRECTV jeter runs the universe
Joe what's it like having a 5 foot 1 troll for a boss?  #wellitsnotwhatyouwant. #firecashman
Arod for president.  Just to piss off the midget GM.  #firecashman
I love the nights when giradri has to give arod a hand job during the post game.  Pisses GM off.  #firecashman
I'm totally shocked jeter let's his hot gf make that stupid @DIRECTV commercial w talking horse.  I feel w break up coming.
@newkingofmedia fill the water bong
@Jamiehop27 tied
Kris Bryant's chunky gf is all over his twitter account.  My new hobby is to track the date he dumps her.  I have may 17th.  Who do u have?
Fuck the islanders.
@96liverpudlians tied
I'm the worlds best shit stirrer.  #handsdown
@NO_TATS_B @fakeliampayne2 but Andy is white it's different.
The yankees should employ those airport workers with those batons to instruct DIDI disasterous which direction to run on the bases.  #ideas
@FranksYanks23 worst yankees I ever witnessed.  Alvaro Espinosa was a vacuum at short.
DIDI disasterous is an automatic out.Questionable defense &amp; should be written citations in the rare instances he reaches base.  #firecashman
@FranksYanks23 agree
@FranksYanks23 cranky watching DIDI disasterous 4 times a night
@FranksYanks23 I do like him
@FranksYanks23 I'm nit picking
@FranksYanks23 I guess
@newkingofmedia disaster signing with his clone already on the team.  #gardner
@newkingofmedia shhhhhhhh toke
@Chris_Giraldo22 u guess it's close
@Chris_Giraldo22 but body of work?
Gift strike 3
So girardi thinks millers stuff is better than Betances? #fireeveryone.
What exactly is it about chase headleys game do I Want to watch for 650 games?  #firecashman
I hope arod hits 35 homers just to go up cashmans ass.  The guys never right.  #firecashman
I wanna to go on the same stuff ellsbury was on when he hit 35 homers a few years ago.  What a fucking full of shit year that was. #Yankees
@FantasyMarkBall were putting on the hangover
This Rodriguez kid can hit.  #Yankees
Got 7th and 8th graders all over my house.  Testosterone to fill a dump truck.  #fridaynight
@nate2usmc except my friend Nate.
I think there is a tie for the worlds dumbest people.  Those that write @nfl mock drafts and those that read them.  #NFLDraft2015
@excellafashion which one???
I would choose a hard core smoker to join my foxhole.  Those fuckers are crazy.
@pimpino you'll see them Friday.  20 plus homers this year
How these crazy fucking smokers continue their habit after seeing these disturbing anti smoking ads is beyond me.
@pimpino kid is can't miss.  Make up off the charts.
@pimpino with 54 homers in 600 professional at bats.  The real deal .
Mini me 
Wasn't Joey just 4 years old the other day? 
@NBCSportsPR @NHLonNBCSports @mnwild @BLUES your broadcast sucks you can't even see the game #amatuerhour
@jwelge96 @TrentonThunder very good idea.  Save 300 too
Fleury incredible tonight.  It should be 6-1. #Rangers
I'm. More into the @TrentonThunder than I am the #Yankees #future
#NYRangers have to come fast to start the third. #BecauseItsTheCup
I love nights DIDI disasterous is out of my life #Yankees
Need another one right now #NYRPlayoffHockey
Exactly what the #NYRangers needed.
Whoooooooooo hoooooooooo #NYRangers
Welcome to the playoffs rick Nash
Really like to see @RickNash61 show up this year
@UrFaveLatina god for fucking bid
Keep cashman far away from Dave dombroski at all times.  #fleeced.
Fire Eric Byrnes @MLBNetwork
When you trade for a guy that led the NL in hits allowed this is what you get.  #evoldi #firecashman
@BronxBomberBlog a bad old team will be fine....oooooooooooook.
Girardi on April 15 utters we need to win series or it will be an awfully long year.  Least he is  honest.
Joe what's it like being the manager of the #yankees  when they suck so bad?  #wellitsnotwhatyouwant.
@BronxBomberBlog wh do I have to trust it?  This team is awful.
What will #yankee games look like when these old men break down in 3 weeks?
@BronxBomberBlog he don't hit they don't field they can't pitch by and large, potential?
@jpf1562 he GM is clueless
So the yankees are going to win 72 games and not play the kids?  Only in the Bronx.  #fireeveryone
635 more games to watch chase headley. #firecashman
Chase Headly sucks.
Ellsbury and Gardner are the same player yet ellsbury makes 3 times as much.  How does the GM justify this?  #firecashman
I miss solarte .  At least he bullshitted me for a month into thinking he wasn't useless.  Unlike the 2015 team.
Drew Chris young and DIDI isn't a professional back end of a lineup.  #yankees #firecashman
@LondonCal_Lin esp with the bruins home.
Betances is back in the #yankees can't develop prospects pile.  #firecashman
@MichaelSalfino cause the cheese is  flat
@ggonzalez03 noooooooo I don't pay to see him.  Guys done.
Betances slider is tee ball practice.
@pjmclaugh yes sadly
Betances at 93 mph meat.  Dr James Andrews in less than 45 days.  Save the tweet.
@pjmclaugh but when Donny was up u watched Winfield too.  This team has nobody.
@ggonzalez03 I'm not saying they never were bad but this is th one team with nobody on it you pay to watch.
@ggonzalez03 but you had Donny
@JForma yup
@pjmclaugh never has a Yankee team had not one guy you can. Get behind.
@pjmclaugh Donny ur missing my point
@JForma no idea
@pjmclaugh the most unwatchable team in their history.
@pjmclaugh I know Mickey was done but you still stopped to watch him.  This team is 25 garbage men.
@pjmclaugh but people came to see him
@JForma totally agree
@pjmclaugh you show up for them. Who does this team have?
@pjmclaugh Thurman
@pjmclaugh Mickey
Run prevention brought to you by the #Orioles #firecashman
@JSC2100 he got 53 million
In the history of the #yankees never have they had not 1 star you'd pay to watch.
@JForma with tanaka and his broken wing there is not 1 guy the yankees have I'd pay to watch
@JForma awful.
Brett Gardner has that "I'm the biggest cocksucker in the gym look" to him.  I never liked him.  #Yankees
#ywnkees need buck to get retarded to get out if the inning.
@LondonCal_Lin I always feel great
@newkingofmedia this team is a punch line.
We want hank we want hank we want hank.  #firehal.
Put hank in charge so I can see furniture being tossed out of the owners suite onto the backstop netting.  #Yankees
Cash out #selltheyankees and restore my sanity.
The problem is Hal is playing polo right now and doesn't know a curveball from a bunt.  #Yankees
@jwelge96 15k in July I think he will care.
@jwelge96 but only you and I remember.  Plus they had Donnie.  Nothing to watch here.  They all suck.
That shitty soccer team they own will out draw this shitty baseball team all summer long.  #yankees
@purenyyankee @KennyBRuns @joesahfeen ny hates a loser esp a Yankee prices
@purenyyankee @KennyBRuns @joesahfeen 22 is high
#selltheyankees #fireeveryone #blowupthemalltheycallastaduim
#firefuckingcashman
@KennyBRuns @joesahfeen knows where the hookers body is buried.
@joesahfeen @KennyBRuns cashman knows where the hookers body is buried,  only explanation I have.
@KennyBRuns @joesahfeen not when 13000 show up in July. Someone will pay.
Even the #yankee bobble head commercials suck.  Can this organization get anything right?
I wonder  what part of cashmans run prevention plan included Beltrans 12 year old girls arm.
@JSC2100 you pitch him at crunch times forget the inning
#yankees will see the first mid season firings they have seen in a  long while.
Girardi goes to martin in garbage time.  Kids his best middle guy.  #firegiradi.
Worst #yankee team 95 percent of twitter has ever seen.
Nice girardi lefty lefty magic. #fireeveryone
The good news is nobody will survive 73 wins #yankees #fireeveryone
Cashmans run prevention all bullpen and defense recipe is a disaster.  #firecashman
Cashman traded two pros for two joke projects jus so he could tell his clueless owner he got younger. #Yankees #firecashman
Vin scully is a master at his craft @MLB @MLBNetwork @Dodgers
You'll see david wright after the kids get out if school.  #sameoldmets.
Carl Crawford is an awful baseball player #Dodgers
Mets falling apart 1 by 1.  They are the jets of @MLB
I'd listen to vin scully read the phone book.  @MLBNetwork
@Churz I like the fister comparasion.
@Churz I don't get it.  Don't get why cashman has the job.
The pictures cashman has of hank having sex with a baboon are invaluable.  #JobSecurity #yankees
Shane greenes era will be near didis on base.  #280
@YankeeJosh @jwelge96 Drew at SS with Greene in rotation.  Cashman sucks
@rangerfan014 vastly overrated.  Inherited a great team bought 2009 and is a disaster ever since.  #FireCashman
Tanaka Pineda green with Drew and prado in the middle and the #yankees are a different team.  #FireCashman worst exec in sports.
@jwelge96 this ones is going to be an all time bad one.  DIDI is a reserve Inf.  MAybe.
I'm going to hire DIDI disastrous to über me to Shane greenes hall of fame induction.  He will need the money #FireCashman
@newkingofmedia go buy legend seats for this great team
@Draft2Dynasty he should donate half the salary to a Bronx boys and girls club.  Guys a bum now.
@Draft2Dynasty lol
CC won win 10 games this year.
@bomberbeat2 esp for this clown at SS
@DiStitz @PatriotsSB49 thank god
@CharlesRobinson @nate2usmc very interesting score.
Shane Greene proves cashman has no eye for talent whatsoever.  #FireCashman
So they want to speed up games.  Now what the fuck do I do?  #yankees
@yankee7kid don't worry they will miss by 15
@J_ACER22 tells Rex Ryan to go fuck himself.  I love it.  #gameon.
#FireCashman #shanegreene #dididisasterous.
@FranksYanks23 GMS brutal
Brian cashman CANNOT survive a Shane Greene all star season. No fucking possible way.  #Yankees
@FranksYanks23 amazing
Machado is silky smooth.  #Orioles
Rex Ryan is an asshole.  #jets
Delmon young #yankeekiller
This  Martin kid can deal #yankees
Baseball plyrs are the worlds biggest pussies.read an injury report?Every one is on it. Inflamed nostrils,scratchy throat grow some balls
Love how it's written that madoff screwed the wilpons.  My question is what the fuck did they do with 300 % returns for 20 years?  #nonsense
@MetsBillboard @DickYoungsGhost @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca never get the idea wilpons gotscrewed,what the fuck did they do w insane returns
My kid just told me his Asian Spanish teacher is prejudice against Italians.  #whycantweallgetalong. Kids outta his fucking mind.
DIDI disasterous #FireCashman
I'm going on @StubHub now to buy tickets to Stephen drews number retirement game.  #Yankees
Arods 3000th hit will me the most slkward moment in sports history.
If your still at the stadium right now, you really have to get a job or a psychoanalysis.  #yankeesvsredsox
@Thunderstixx @Mike_Randazzo34 @jpf1562 good dear lord, lol
@LondonCal_Lin unless you wanna come over. Lol
@LondonCal_Lin I don't fall for temporary panaceas
FBI must interrogate DIDI ASAP to find the exact location of where Brian cashman is running his meth lab empire,
@BennyBXB @lar_2016 kids awful #next
Holy fuck end this game.
Yankee stadium plays smaller than my yard.
Hey joe talk about the total incompetence your GM brought you at SS?  #wellitsnotwhatyouwant.
Putting a mannaquin at SS with a #2 jersey would make me happier than DIDI disasterous,
DIDI disastrous cannot fucking play.  #FireCashman
DIDI disasterous.  Sit this motherfucker now.  #Yankees
@yankeeclassic46 these fuckin beards
@Mike_Randazzo34 I totally see that.  I vote jeb, guys the smartest bush of em all.  Can't look at Hilary for 4 years.
No more fucking around no experiments no Hilary.  Back to old White men with ties to the free masons and the illuminati to run the country.
@YanktheMike I thought he was going lefty lefty I agree w u
@Chris_Giraldo22 yes I thought he was going lefty lefty I take it back
This Idea that girardi manages a bullpen perfectly is nonesense,  guy hasn't made an October pitching change in 37 years.
Fucking girardi playing lefty lefty up 8.  What an asshole.  #yankeesredsox
DIDI disastrous can't buy a hit.
DIDI disastrous up.  #yankeesvsredsox
My entire divorce settlement will take less time than a #Yankee #RedSox game.
@wintersball Yankee killer as in we can't get him out, like manny, Ortiz and Edgar Martinez.
Boegarts seems  like he is going to be the next #yankee killer over the next decade.  Hits 260 vs everyone else.
@FranksYanks23 he was better than game1, but not nearly ace good.  I can get 60 pitchers to pitch this way.
I'm amazed how uncomfortable a 10-4 lead with this current #yankee roster.  #FireCashman
DIDI disastrous is the worst #yankee I've seen in 30 years of watching closely,  he does nothing professionally.  #yankeesvsredsox
635 more games to watch chase headley!  Why?  #FireCashman
@96liverpudlians @Shareek_Nyy #FireCashman
@BinderGirardi somebody has to pay.  The GM should really be the one, but he is here for life.
@MichaelPawluk they won't have 22 wins after may.
@LondonCal_Lin for u esp.
Was just thinking, this awful #Yankees lineup needs a solid professional hitter like Martin prado, oh shit, wait.  #FireCashman
@jwelge96 not terrible, if they can beat tackles to the edge.
@jwelge96 agree on qbs.  How big is beasly?
@jwelge96 who do you guess is the pick at 6?
@jwelge96 which let's face it, the #jets will blow.  Somehow.
the old days the #yankees would transfer eras by going from Donnie to tino.  Nowadays it's jeter to DIDI dogshit.  My how times have changed
Another #yankee game today.  It's not what you want.
AT least when they sucked in 1989 you didn't need to borrow against the house to take your kids to #YankeeStadium #Yankeesstink
@yankeessaddays gave CC 60 million more than next bid plus opt out .  Worst GM in sports
@yankeessaddays agree a million percent.
The FBI should demand from cashman the exact gps coordinates of the location that Hal buried the hookers body.  #jobsecurityforlife.
Brian cashman should be required to face the media everyday.  And a firing squad once a week.  #yankees
#yankees are going to have to have $5 bj night in august to get anyone to show up.
Every bit of this is #ARod s fault.  #Yankees
Arod at dinner with his agent is going to ask him to go to @MLB to ask if he can wear a suit of armor the next time he plays first base.
Girardi looks 79 years old.
#didi has the baseball instincts of a placekicker.  #YANKSonYES
I'd give anything for girardi to say "a retarded general manager isn't what you want". #YANKSonYES #FireCashman
The next time Hal charges the fans to sit in the mall he calls a baseball staduim, he may want his shitty team to wake up a little.
Dear #yankee fans from the "it's early still" school of thought, fuck you.  #fireeveryone
#yankees need to re issue uniform numbers.  Lowest should. Be 55, highest 80.  #minorleaguers.
@StubHub is going to pay #Yankee fans to show up in august and sept.
@YankeeJosh because corner gas stations are managed better.    That's why.  #fireeveryone
@jwelge96 indeed
Blow it up.  Week 1 #yankees
By Far, the dimmest lights in the world are the people that take and respond to my #yankee twitter rhetoric seriously.
I'm going to have DIDI chauffeur me to Shane greenes's hall of fame induction ceremony.  #Yankees he will need the money.
Hey joe can you comment on the shitty defens?  #wellitsnotwhatyouwant
I'm officially more into the @TrentonThunder than the #yankees.
How long till arod misjudged a ball and breaks throwing fingers covering a catch?  I'm fucking Nostradamus #yankeesvsredsox  #Yankees
#nyr fans freaking out today proves ny sports fans are the most dangerous people alive.  We should all b forced into 2 year front line duty,
DIDI is do do #yankees
Bases loaded.  #yankeetease
I could make 3 billion a year as a roving bunt instructor.  #stoptheshifts.
In purgatory the boss just walked over to billy Martin and punched him in the throat.  #forthefuckofit.
Warren  will go 3 innings and randy Levine will get into this game.  Can't hurt the #yankee brand any more can it?
This #yankee horse dung is impossible to watch.  #AmateurNight
Let arod catch.
@tbrandsports101 @YankeesFan_64 @RealMichaelKay because corner gas stations are better run than the #yankees
@newkingofmedia Drew and gregarious can't hit a lick.  Beltrans done.
@newkingofmedia bring em up, let em play, surprise people, win 70 and get a top 3 pick.  It's such the right thing to do.
The #yankees should install turn signals at each base to help with #didigregorious base running confusion.  #winningideas
Missing a #yankee game is a lot like not being able to make your appointment with your whip wielding dominatrix.  #YankeesChat
@JRRestaino time for mylanta
@newkingofmedia bring the kids up win 70 games, get a top 5 pick and go from there.  The Beltran Drew arod saga must end.
@newkingofmedia I don't expect 90 wins I don't expect playoffs, I do expect major league at bats and these guys don't give them.
@newkingofmedia I agree with what your saying about transition.  Serving me Drew and gregarious is unconscionable.  Esp Drew.
@newkingofmedia I see pig slop I call it out.  You hit the bong.  I don't judge.
@newkingofmedia I will pay you 5 times what you paid for the weed you are smoking.  I want to reject reality too.
@newkingofmedia there's 500 followers correctly identifying this shit team and you who wake and bake.
@newkingofmedia #FireCashman
@newkingofmedia shhhhhhh
Gregarious makes Bernie look like he has the base running instincts of ricky Henderson.  Perhaps the worst Yankee I've ever seen.
@JoeyBagohDonutz horrendous.  Non competitive at bats,
My #Yankees plan.  #FireCashman put girardi on probation, DFA beltan, arod, call the kids up and I'll watch
@jwelge96 one will be average, one will bust, one will be traded and star, severino will need TJS.  I've lost faith.
@jwelge96 there needs to be a leadership chance.  Aj preller changed sandiego in 4 months on a shoestring budget. Get me one of those guys.
@Bxrich3 nothing worse than an atzec to me
@jwelge96 cashman will trade 2 of them to save his job and chase 83 wins.
Watching Drew, gregarious back to back is like driving from a root canal to a colonoscopy in a Pontiac atzec.  End my fucking pain #yankees
The #yankees won title after title with knobloch beaning fans sitting behind first base, and Refsnyder isn't ML ready?  And fucking Drew is?
@KPNYJ Jesus fucking Christ how is he not here?
Pour more kerosene Light a match to this dumpster fire #Yankee team. DFA anyone over 36,get kids up here.End the pain early and #FireCashman
DFA Beltran today.  Get the kid up here before the revolt takes hold.  #YankeesCallHimUp #FireCashman
Drew gregorious are fireable offenses. not going to hit big with every move, but if your plan includes 2 sub major lgrs up middle u gotta go
Have they did the right thing and #FireCashman yet? #Yankees atrocious
@jwelge96 the GM is a disaster.  Drew, young, capuano, Ryan, all embarrassments
@jwelge96 neither are major league hitters
@jwelge96 niether
This Yankee team in 7 hour doses is nauseating.
Gregorious is useless #Yankees I get him out.
@jwelge96 like the lefty
If the #yankees even had a half assed team, I'd be so into this game.
@KPNYJ lol was out.  That's 1 no??? B
Red Sox have #yankees right where they want them.  DIDI on the bases.  #blundercoming
@madbad my team is working on 75 wins so it matters very little what month it is.
@madbad totally agree
@madbad so not true.  A win or a lose in April means exactly what a win or a loss does in sept.  Win em now, worry less later.
@newkingofmedia what we have is a! Shitty baseball team
@newkingofmedia lol
@JSC2100 but they won so u can't disparage.
@JSC2100 huh? I don't follow, guys bought the team and won 3 times building it right?  That's  a gift from selig?  I don't follow
@JSC2100 theo is going to win in Chicago too
@newkingofmedia watch
Ny is going to swallow DIDI whole.  Just saw the post game interview.  #YankeesMiLB #YANKSonYES
@newkingofmedia he wins 12 tops.
@newkingofmedia he pitched decently.  I expect not much from him.
Remember when the #yankees and Red Sox had a rivalry?  Problem. Is he #yankees have fallen way behind as an organization in several ways
@JSC2100 meanwhile Red Sox have moncada and Castillo in the minors seasoning.  It's not even close which is a better run org.
@nate2usmc I'm guessing beasly
Matt Harvey is as nasty as it gets
@nate2usmc who do they pick at 6?
@JSC2100 I'll believe in judge bird severino when they make it.  Nothing more over hyped than a #Yankees prospect.  I'm sick of it
@nate2usmc then the jets will blow it and I can leave the yankees alone
CC sabathia sounds like a 450 lb loser.  #Yankees
@JSC2100 Aj preller changes sandiego fortunes in 4 months, this regime has floundered for years
@JSC2100 totally agree
@nate2usmc seriously
The t2 best #yankees are ellsbury, Gardner who are the exact same player. Even that is a mistake in the building of this club. #FireCashman
@JSC2100 he guy is clueless
@newkingofmedia your high
So gregorious has no concept of base running.  #FireCashman
#yankees lead the universe in getting burned by these stupid shifts.
@newkingofmedia yea where's the posey?  And both teams were youthful.  You can't win with this age
Jeter is going to dump this broad for making this dumb @DIRECTV ad with the talking horse.  #YANKSonYES
@newkingofmedia you cannot have a line up this bad and win.
@newkingofmedia Drew belongs no where near the roster.
DIDI gregorious has the baseball acumen and instincts of a sumo wrestler
@jwelge96 on a team that can't hit a lick, you roll some dice.
@Draft2Dynasty can't even watch Drew
Girardi just admitting CC can't cover first base.  Lol #25milliondollarman.
Hey joe what do you think of this pig slop cashman has given you?  #wellitsnotwhatyouwant.  #Yankees
Refsnyder not here and drew flailing away nightly is everything that is wrong with this #yankee regime.  #FireCashman
@Draft2Dynasty how he isn't here is everything that is wrong with the yankees.
20 year olds are dominating 38 year old #Yankees #fireeveryone.
@UrFaveLatina but so worth it
Why the motherfuck is Stephen Drew on this team?  #FireCashman
@KPNYJ 250 hits given up in NL.  Watch this batting practice.
@newkingofmedia the team is awful we will. Agree to disagree. You would love anyone they throw out there.  That is established.
The road to 76 wins continues #Yankees
#yankee at bats aren't professional
@newkingofmedia tweet me in July
@newkingofmedia gregorious is horrible Greene will win 15 #FireCashman
@newkingofmedia I knew this 3 months ago.
@newkingofmedia oh please stop.  This team is awful.
@jwelge96 this team is awful.  They have 2 good players and they are the exact same guy.  Even that is a mistake.  #FireCashman
Prado and Greene for DIDI and eovioldi is brutal.  #FireCashman
@BinderGirardi #FireCashman
Protecting a 3 run lead vs the #yankees should only count as a third of a save.  #rulechanges
@JAsports70
I just went on @StubHub and bought Fourth of July #yankee tickets for .45 cents each.  And I hesitated.  Wanted a quarter.
Game 3 #yankee fans revolt.  I love it.
@SkippyBayless01 no they are the maggots eating the shit.
Light #cashman on fire and burn arods shit in the inferno.  Charge pay preview #yankees
I want a new GM to select the #yankees #1 overall draft pick in 2016.  #70wins #FireCashman
#FireCashman how does he have this job?
The FBI must detain #cashman tonight, demand he hand over the exact gps coordinates of the hooker he helped Hal Steinbrenner hide. #yankees
Shane Greene.  #FireCashman #now
Cc's ERA will be 6.00+. #70wins #FireCashman #Yankees
Ok I take it all back, #yankees winning it all.  Lol #fairweatherfans.
@CourtneyHosking I'd love him to do well, but he was shot 3 years ago.  Guys a bum.
Alex Rodriguez uniform is a waste of perfectly good detergent.  Cut this fuck please.  #yankees
Brian McCann is horrible.  #yankees
@JEspo0022 arods bat is a rusty gate, been that way  since aug 2013
@JEspo0022 the 7-8-9 is the worst in the American League.
@sportstoughguy teams bad
@LondonCal_Lin  as cute as you are, I'll follow nascar first and I can't change oil.
Game 2 and the #yankees are already unwatchable.  #firecashman
@GreedyStripes 78
39 degrees April 8th.  I'm calling bullshit. #whereisspring.
Who knew fredo corleone would be this  good a college basketball coach.  #Duke
#CoachK for president
When #FrankKaminsky gets ass tonight the axiom of the athlete gets the girl will be proved ad infinitum.  Guys funny looking as it gets
@mgilliga Saban went from one sec powerhouse to an even bigger one.  I don't get what ü mean
@FauxPelini @BayAreaFan2 when in doubt call it dukes way.  National law.
When in doubt cool it #dukes way
If anyone doesn't think #CoachK is the best coach In America they are out if their mind.
Bye bye whiskey.  #NCAAChampionship
The cream always rises.  #Duke #CoachK
@mgilliga teams bad
spent $250 today, stared in boredom at cashmans #Yankee team.could have stayed home,held my nose,saved money and stared at my dogs Morn shit
The #yankees now run out the core poor.  #YankeesBaseballIsBack #YankeesChat #YankeeStadium #YankeeNation
I'm not overreacting to one game, but where exactly is the #Yankees upside? Teams awful.  #FireCashman
I understand the #Yankees cannot win every year, but does Hal know at his prices the team has to be watchable?  Terrible baseball.
@NFLguy07840 awful not one exciting moment.  Place will draw flies in 8 weeks
The subway ride away from #YankeeStadium was so much more fun than the game. This is an awful baseball team. Place was quiet as the Vatican
@nate2usmc if been quiet long enough
@nate2usmc disgusting g
@nate2usmc awful
At the staduim,I could move down to just behind the dugout but the shit team cashman assembled isn't worth it.  #FireCashman
#FireCashman
Opening day in Bronx 10,000 people left.  #FireCashman #halmustsell
13,000 at #YankeeStadium in July will be odd.#minorleaguebaseball
@Draft2Dynasty awful
Fuck every #Yankees apologist on #Twitter this is embaressing.  #YankeesBaseballIsBack #YANKSonYES
@FranksYanks23 awful team awful vibe here. 1991 all over again. Minus Donny.  #awful.
@Draft2Dynasty it's baseball 101
@Draft2Dynasty it's horrendous
@Draft2Dynasty down. Late with top of order.  You can't make a worse baseball decision,  stop drinking Yankee Kool aid
@Draft2Dynasty it's the dumbest play of all time
3rd out stealing third down 5 runs. Train wreck baseball in the Bronx.  Disgusting.  #Yankees #YANKSonYES
Stub hub is going to pay fans to go to games In August.  I can't wait.  #YankeesBaseballIsBack #Yankees #YANKSonYES #YankeesChat
1991 all over again in the Bronx.  Only this time nobody classy like Donnie to watch.  #Yankees are dog shit
YMCA time at the staduim, highlight of the day.  #Yankees #75wins maybe.
@jwelge96 this  place is dead.  Quiet as a mouse.
@jwelge96 20 70 would be a miracle
The arod love is nauseating.  #Yankees
At the stadium, th standing o for #ARod is a bit much
Football stats should be more readily accessible like baseball stats I wanna know who leads the lg 4thqtr 3rd 4th down sacks. Pay those guys
@teacht79 @mgilliga good point
@teacht79 @mgilliga I understand thAt, but he isn't a 15 mil a year player.  And sacks bust games open.
Padres getting a Yankee type club, the yankees looking like a padre type club.  Next dogs everywhere will begin mating cats.  #MLB2015
@Chris_Giraldo22 @Padres they will be very exciting.  Team went from horrible to loaded in 4 months
@mgilliga  still a boatload for a guy with 24 sacks over 5 years.  Very overrated.  Nice player tho.
So the @Padres are now the new #Yankees
@mgilliga they Better not give him suh money.  Not the same player
#Yankees will be one of their 78 wins today.
@RAKcity27 @AROD never thought I'd see it.
@FranksYanks23 severino judge bird will get us there
@FranksYanks23 mets drf more wins.  I say 84-86.  Pitching is solid.  Team is improved.  I'll watch Harvey starts.  Kids the goods.
@FranksYanks23 1993 again.  Wish I was 23 tho!!!!!!!!
@FranksYanks23 low estimate 82 high.  75-76 easy tho.
I think #Easter ranks like12th on my list of favorite holidays.  Just no feel to it at all.  Get me to opening day #YankeeStadium
@jwelge96 I'm investing heavily in my fantasy team and fan duel
@jwelge96 it's really crazy.  220 mil and LF and cf are predicable.  ( but I'm also predicting ellsbury to miss 70 games) he is over due.
@pgammo it's a results business,  fucking liberals.
Will the #Yankee middle infield hit .240 and drive in a combined 90 runs?  I'm not so sure. Will the OF hit a combined 45 homers?  #notsure
Something very satisfying seeing #Calipari having it shoved up his ass #Final4 #NCAATournament
First time in w generation I walk into a #Yankees season with zero expectations.   82 wins.  Maybe.
@yanksalways @Bxrich3 so true
@Bxrich3 nope 25 pitches he comes out of game
@jwelge96 complete joke
Dear #yankees dear #tanaka just get the fucking TJS and stop jerking us all off.  #YankeesChat #YANKSonYES
Opening day, Randolph crush vs. Wayne.  Joey the closer, I hope he nails one down this afternoon.  #baseballisback
Thank god the great game of #baseball is back.  The game has given me my best memories as a boy, a man, a father and a son.  #playball
@nycajun1 @Draft2Dynasty @jedleyq another terrible cashman contract.  #beltran
I can't get enough of #Hozier @pandora_radio
@Draft2Dynasty @jedleyq @nycajun1 ??????? 20 homers in 1200 minor league at bats with a high of 8 in AA is no power.
@jedleyq @nycajun1 just what we need another no power outfielder
Keep on usin me till you use me up.
@amdonn1031 as lovely as you are, that "I can't wait to spend Good Friday with my wonderful wife" has roots somewhere, Lolol

@PeteAbe on business with sox fan who doesn't believe in twitter, changing his mind,u can help by tweeting back, who does swihart compare to
I was in high school 435 years ago the last time the #Yankees were 33-1 shots to win the World Series.  #firecashman
Spell check is as useless as @BarackObama
My favorite fuckers are the Yankee, ny giants, lakers, Kentucky wildcat fans.
@NFLguy07840 @miami13mike some ways I rather go there than the actual games.  Mike is the best bar owner as well, feel like ur in his house.
Another fantastic day at @miami13mike , the best sports bar in America.  #fantasybaseballdraft.

#WestVirginia sux.  #Sweet16
@96liverpudlians not bad just old.  She was perfect.
Ashley Judd is proof that #fathertime is as undefeated as #KentuckyWildcats are
#calipari is a snake but he wins
Kentucky is like men vs boys
I wouldn't fuck with zucc. #NYR
Let cam play.  #NYRangers
@newkingofmedia relax
@beoutmuhhfugg totally agree
@beoutmuhhfugg price was out.  This year he is the best goalie in sport
@beoutmuhhfugg Canadians scare me.  Red wings too
Would I do time if I kill this fucking dog?
Tanner glass MVP #nyr #bringmethecup
@beoutmuhhfugg playoffs are a diff deal I agree.
@beoutmuhhfugg I think they are winning it
@beoutmuhhfugg that's no lock to win it.  But they have a great shot.
@beoutmuhhfugg anomaly.  This is the best team in hockey.
Polish the cup.  Coming to #NewYork #NYR
#NYR are a machine

Lotta crazies here @twitter
@Dodgers money is just silly.
My DMs pile up whenever @UrFaveLatina retweets me. I sorta
Ike it.  Even tho I'm called all sorts of names.
When the first #Martini slides down that fast you know your In for 3.  Good thing it's a 10 am meeting walking g distance away.
Good to be back on the road #Philly #chileanseabass @GreyGoose
LET CAM START #NYR
Cam talbot just earned himself a huge pay day somewhere.
Cam talbot is a brick wall.  #NYR
I wonder how joe hid the crystal meth smoke today in the clubhouse as he made today's lineup out?  #Yankees
Joe should let judge pitch next.  Why the fuck not.  #Yankees
Girardi after game, joe you cost the kid his career. Well it's not whAt you want #Yankees
CC isn't even average anymore.
@UrFaveLatina if you blow bad, I'll be by with horse drawn carriage take you wherever the fuck u need to go.
@haveyouheardofg @UrFaveLatina @tacobell high end jasmine scent too
Flattulance from @UrFaveLatina after @tacobell still smells like sweet jasmine to me.
@MichaelJRico there are roumers  out there
@leeovalentin I think cooper goes to raiders.  They are in desperate need.
Regardless of the cards dealt, play the hand like you are the baddest mother fucker alive and you'll be fine.  #freeadvicesunday.
@leeovalentin but I want mariota before geno and fitz.  Just if you miss it's 2020 and we still suck.  Scary.
@drmtesta no I can't but it's fantasy Sunday
@leeovalentin marcus scares me.  Looks like a system guy
@leeovalentin and I'm not saying rivers delivers.  I'm just a lot  more excited if he comes.
@leeovalentin I love the off season but I hate the qbs
@leeovalentin #facts the #jets are an 8 win team with smart Fitzpatrick or idiot geno
@leeovalentin takes a lil luck and the chargers are never great your over stating it.
If you put fitzpatricks head on genos body, #jets go on a long multi year run.
@leeovalentin prob the biggest no brainer trade target in history, given the jet alternatives
@leeovalentin big strong leader, career passing rating of 97 and his name isn't geno smith or Ryan Fitzpatrick.
@Hozier has pipes
@MichaelJRico not predicting g it.  I said it changes the conversation.
Fantastic tune.  Let it be me.  @RayLaMontagne #pandora 
@MichaelJRico in reset mode, sure they do.
The #jets get phillip rivers and the whole fucking conversation changes.
Dee milliner is going to net back a solid box of jock itch cream in trade #Jets
My son last night informed me that feeling a tit was now apart of first base, he said it was ion first base w a decent lead. #teenagers
Another great time at @miami13mike s last night!!!!!   Actually left as big mike was shutting the lights!!! No better sports bar in America.
@Eddie_YN26 ugh imagine the producers of the show are really investing in it!!!  How can anyone be entertained by this garbage?
@Eddie_YN26 I don't even know why it's on but I watched 3 minutes.  It breaks reality tv stupid records.
This #MarriedAtFirstSight show proves that human beings are out of their fucking minds.  Who watches this shit?
I survived #MarchMadness #friday
@pandora_radio somebody told me about the station.  #awesome
3 miles done. 3 water bottles done, skake done.  Let the carnage commence.  #MarchMadness #friday #drinkingolympics
@GL0401 it was a rhetorical question that took my mind off wanting to take a kitchen knife to him
@VictorLaBoy lol
@GL0401 oh no!
@john_zsoldos was sort of rhetorical.  Wanna kill this thing half the time, lol
And yes @UrFaveLatina has that kind of power.
@UrFaveLatina going without make up is going to force a revolution amoug woman worldwide and @Loreal will be bankrupt in less than a year.
@leeovalentin perfect looking dog who would get adopted in a matter of hours.
@leeovalentin vizsla, was sorta thinking out loud, the dogs a handful, but not sure I could get rid of him.  It's in the back of my mind tho
Where do you take a dog you don't want anymore?
Last night sent scathing mail to my boss ripping current processes, this morning first thing re read it. I'll still be employed. I think lol
I'm back in the @twitter mood.  Was out of my system for weeks.
The "hipster cocktail party" station on @pandora_radio has pretty much changed the soundtrack I live my life to.  Excellent find this week
It could snow 4 feet today, I don't care.  I'll be imbibing at @miami13mike joint for 12 hours today.  #letitsnow.
@bigjowe cocksucking winter
#MarchMadness Friday.  Up early hydrating.  Today drinking becomes an Olympic event.
@madbad 1200% with you.

@LondonCal_Lin tomorrow this time I'm going to make up for it by being a drunken bastard. #MarchMadness

@GL0401 yessssssssss

@UKJetsHQ pace cannot be back
Nothing beats choices.
@TheBigEasy5889 good point
@TheBigEasy5889 need playmakers still
I wanted spiller #jets
I hate this fucking dog.
One of the top 3 reasons I stay here is I love cooking my kids breakfast on Sundays.  I have to think about what the other 2 are. #life.
@jwelge96 I don think cooper will be there
@jwelge96 I think it's Vic beasly and if he dominates the edge, this maybe the best defense in the league.  Which it never was under Rex
@jwelge96 either way I'm firmly in the GMS corner. Heck I'd a first 60 dAys.
@jwelge96 enough baggage there where they will consider trading out of 1
@jwelge96 why not.
If geno had a head. I'd truly be excited for the #jets
Woman vastly overate the true value of a vagina.  It's truly an epidemic.
I fuckin didn like #Pi in high school and so #PiDay2015 can go fuck itself today.
@ChrisBiv they play in the pop warner AFC east they never have to worry about playing on the road,
Never underestimate the value of a great drinking buddy.
@HeitMikekh4 love the GM
Vic beasly will be the #6 pick of the @nyjets.
@jwelge96 QB is huge hole.  But they are relavent.  If geno had a head, I'd be super excited.
@jwelge96 I'm pleased with the off season,
@RichCimini @jaylee_222 not bad.  Rich your an asshole.
#WillFerrell is a fucking classic

If frank #Sinatra somehow bottled his swagger, I'd order some on @amazon right now.  And I don't buy shit.
#nyr unstoppable at this point.
@mbrogz13 you swayed me
@mbrogz13 good point
@mbrogz13 well I don't know about that but I see your point
Mark teixera will literally complain about anything. #shutupandplay. #earnthemoney
@BMonzoWFAN @WFAN660 that means it's a lock to happem.  #mushfrancesa
My kid is a lot like me, he gets a call last night at 9:30 for a road trip to Panama City fl, and he leaves tonight at 8.  #LiveLife
@mortifiedbam that's funny
@Jthrush84 diff game then
@FranksYanks23 but without a QB 8 wins
@FranksYanks23 that happens instant contention
@FranksYanks23 roumers say Brees avail.
@mbrogz13 Bree's avail?  Really?
@FranksYanks23 I guess just the jet way that he declines now
#jets give revis a brinks truck of cash just in time for him to slow a step.
@jwelge96 60 tomorrow here in ny.  Oh happy day.
#ryanfitzpatrick is the penultimate #jets move.
@jwelge96 now they back up the brinks truck for revis or get pissed on by the patriots AGAIN
The #jets swing and miss more than Curtis granderson #NFLFreeAgency
#Revis would sign with the #yankees and second base If that was the highest offer given to his agent.  #Jets
@NFLguy07840 lol yea I have no idea where that came from has been shaky
@NFLguy07840 hawks are no joke
@NFLguy07840 great game last night.  Both teams are going to have deep runs.
@MichaelSalfino unfortunately that means Fitzpatrick is coming here
Looking forward to the #ranger #Blackhawks game tonight.  Good test
@UrFaveLatina 7 million in New York

If you wanna dance, you have to pay the band.  But the fucking music is worth it.
@jwelge96 Harris back is solid too not a crazy contract
@jwelge96 yes. I agree
@jwelge96 I fear tenn making the Philly deal and us adding more defense.  It's fine but it's also 8-8.
@jwelge96 big risk but huge upside, they get a journeyman it's 8 wins for 4 years.  Gamble or trade pick for foles and picks
@jwelge96 i want mariota
@jwelge96 spiller ivory backs we don't need lance alworth
@jwelge96 7.5 a steal
@jwelge96 what is his salary?
@jwelge96 they are all headaches
I fucking love mike Mac.  #jets well done #BrandonMarshall

@ym_allie equally fantastic
@ym_allie fantastic pic.
In case you didn't hear me the other day, fuck you #winter.  Only this time fuck you straight in the ear.
@Exit345 @UrFaveLatina I happen to be one of the privileged few to get a free follow.  Wit makes our goddess wet.
$10 for a followback from @UrFaveLatina is the bargain of the decade.  Shits worth $100 easy.  #sendyourmoneyin
When the #Yankees or #jets aren't activly sucking, I have a lot less to say on @twitter
Preseason baseball on tv is like taking a blow torch to my soul.  #baseballisback @MLBNetwork
Amazed how lucky I've gotten recently.  #fate.
My dog got his balls chopped off today. I really love the dog more while he is heavily sedated by meds.  #jett.  #loonydog

So wait snow then Ice yesterday and more snow Thursday?  Fuck this.  I've had it.
Why the fuck is @BarackObama making deals with #Iran?
@BarackObama not supporting #Netanyahu really makes me wonder.  Israel must be unilaterally supported.
Fuck you winter.
@nysportsgal lol you too
@davetheflashguy 16 feels like 70
@davetheflashguy feels good means his fuckin winter is over,  I sat and ate and drank for 90 days
The march shape up begins.  More sweat, less beer, zero pizza #summer2015
@UrFaveLatina nope
@FranksYanks23 I agree
@FranksYanks23 yes I see that headline now.  When it tears it tears
@FranksYanks23 he is def getting the TJS
@FranksYanks23 wow 5 years ago, impressive I had no idea who he was before 2013, holy shit
@FranksYanks23 can't believe he went for a buck
A guy that personified that @nyknicks team, #RIPAnthonyMason
@kreativekonnect he already said he wouldn't take less.  11 mil is simply too much
@kreativekonnect Lolololol I lost track of tweets.  I like him but not at 11 million he is a specialist.  Use the money elswhere.
@kreativekonnect Putin?
@twitter is infinitely less exciting when @UrFaveLatina is on a jet with no wifi for 5 hours.They should shut the servers off till she lands
Absolutely the truth, i have wilder, better stories from my 40s then my 20s.
@Robbasemusic and a treadmill just goes together
@MidnightBashem Kevin long sucks
I wouldn't fuck with #Putin

These new luggage rack designs are fucked up,  from the RV mirror they look like cops always.  So I shit myself every 5 miles driving.
Don't care what color the #TwitterDress is, just please don't wear that table cloth around me.  Ty.
@GioCBS @WFAN660 radio platinum
@UrFaveLatina honestly, you will look better natural.
Is it me or does 13 degrees feel warmer on a Friday?  #TGIF
I don't give a fuck what color the #TwitterDress is , it's ugly as sin in either color
@xPxPlayaxRx @Jaguars was a joke
@UrFaveLatina this is why they should pay $500 for a follow back.
The #TwitterDress phenomenon is proof that humans are shaved Down sheep.
idzik got hired by @Jaguars. They are going to have him in the war room making draft recommendations, then they will do the exact opposite.
Remember when you didn't "get" @twitter?  Look at you now.
@UrFaveLatina is so hot she would rock that ugly ass gold and white #TwitterDress.  Or whatever the fuck the colors are.
$5.00 for a @UrFaveLatina follow back is the best bargain in the American economy today.  #truth.
Anyone can be in #JoshHamilton s shoes.  That's why you don't fuck with the hard stuff even once.
@nate2usmc horrendous
#Lebrons hairline is going to start at his neck rolls pretty soon.  Damn king shave it off bro.  @KingJames
My dog just took longer to find a suitable place to crap than I took the last time I bought a house.
Just wait till the #yankees start 1-13
As you can see I'm coming out of my @twitter slump
Here's my #ISIS elimination plan FUCKING SHOCK AND AWE.  TODAY.  #assholeobama. @BarackObama
The key to getting woman to retweet you is to make fun of #VictoriaSecret models evidently.  Lol
But again @AngelAlessandra can still #GetSome
These #VictoriaSecretbathingsuit models have perfected the white girl shuffle.  They can't move at all.
@Cyb3rb0r6 @JLo runs the planet we all just enjoy the oxygen she allows us.
@AngelAlessandra can still get it tho, LOL
#VictoriaSecretbathingsuit models need to eat 3 cheeseburgers each. Way too thin, built like 14 year old boys
When @cbs airs a @UrFaveLatina swimsuit special I'll watch, until then it's back to @espn for me
I don't get the #VictoriaSecretbathingsuit hype.  Way too skinny these woman.  Get @JLo to wear one and I'll watch.  @CBS
#fuckthedress
Nothing beats freedom
@PadmaLakshmi does shit to me.

Perfectly formed shit bricks dropping from the bosses ass as he watches from above or below how his prepschool pussy son is running the show

#BusterPosey has 3 rings and David wright has 300 excuses.  #FaceOfTheMLB
@newkingofmedia again the most non sense promotion/poll ever.  If your in Anaheim it's trout, SF, posey, etc etc.  dumb
@newkingofmedia dumbest poll in the long history of polling
@NYJ3Mets laughable
#DavidWright isn't even the face of his team, forget the #FaceOfMLB ridiculous
Nice productive trip.  #BetterCallSaul tonight #dvr.
@madbad fat panda to first base in 2 years.  Brilliant move.
Fuck the Red Sox. Day 2.  I'm doing this until October.
@jwelge96 I actually didn't realize that.  In think the team is sold soon.  Hearts not into it.  #markcuban
@jwelge96 they really are.  Treat woody like he is a devil, never 1 word on hal.
@jwelge96 yup what a bad day
@UrFaveLatina charging $5 for a follow back is the sale of the century.  She should charge $500.  It's that good.
Just read #yankees signed bam bam meulens to platoon w arod at DH.  How exciting.
@bomberbeat2 and I care less about paying his ridiculous prices in the Bronx.
Fuck the Red Sox.
#yankee tickets on stub hub are going to be $8.00 in august and I'm still not going to go.  #halmustgo #SellTheYankees
@mbrogz13 indeed.  Rather have mark Cuban
@mbrogz13 not sure they have the 3 billion
@newkingofmedia out of your mind
@jwelge96 good point
@jwelge96 in a heartbeat.  Not sure he is pending half his wealth on the yankees tho.
@jwelge96 maybe they aren't the "yankees" anymore
@JForma this deal is taxed at 100 percent.  So it's 60 million.  But who gives a fuck
The Red Sox have spent 130 million in the Cuban market place In the last 7 months.  The yankees have done jack shit.
The Sox are so well run.  They don't even have a clear slot for moncada over the next 3 years and they get him anyway.  That's how it's done
@JForma they don't care.  They just want talent.
Not only do we miss in moncada but we have to see him crush us 19 times a season for 15 years.  Disaster.
@CoachZEsq and we have to look at him 19 times killing us.
I'm so pissed off.
@MichaelPawluk utter disaster.  The ball yard will be empty by June,
@FranksYanks23 working on a bad decade.
@jwelge96 this one he has to have.  30 million seems like a bargain.  I know it's 60 but still.
@RaymondPbock it's the owner whose the moron
@KPNYJ excellent point
The only thing I'm thinking is Hal is selling the team in 2'years and just doesn't give a fuck.  #Yankees
@Bullies670 and he goes to the Red Sox.
The boss just walked over to billy Martin in heaven and kicked him in the balls for the fuck of it.  #moncada
Inexcusable.  #yankees I won't go once this year.  Fuck Hal.
@MsRiaBerry son of a bitch
@jwelge96 I don't get it.  I really don't.
@MsRiaBerry check your time line.  In 2 mins. News everywhere
@jwelge96 this is a disaster.
@ZeppieriTony total disaster
@MsRiaBerry ur twitter will blow up w news In 2 mins
@MsRiaBerry just now
@MsRiaBerry he signed w Red Sox
@FranksYanks23 beyond disgusted.
What the fuck are the #yankees doing?
#moncada to the Red Sox disaster

Amazing how #oprah never ages.  Her ass grows leaps and bounds though #AcademyAwards
@OllieNYankees lol ok.
@GinaluvzNYY agree!!!
Wtf does a sound editor do?  @oscars.
@GinaluvzNYY sings like nobodies business.  Awesome.  Even if I hate the sound of music.
#Oscars are funny, they celebrate films nobody sees and people whose jobs nobody knows anything about. Wtf does a cinematographer do? Please
@GinaluvzNYY of of no where.  I'm watching and I'm like. Hmmmm....mmmmm.  Lol never did that before.
#LadyGaga Italian of course
Is it me or is #gaga getting hot?

I would score on cam talbot and I have a peg leg.  #NYR
Now the shootout loss.  #talbotblows. #NYRangers
In the race for the worlds most beautiful woman, @JLo has a secretariat type of lead.
You need 9 goals with #talbot in net.  Play Richie Cunningham.
Cam talbot is not a professional goalie.  Play the red head.  #NYRangers
#NYRangers tend to get pass happy #shootthepuck
@sportstoughguy #rightturnclyde

Clint Eastwood would kick anyone's ass.

@GL0401 don't know aloe must look it up.  Usher very talented.

@pandora_radio wonderful Sunday
@GL0401 excellent
@GL0401 love joe, blackest white man ever.  Lemme go find.
@GL0401 he was just on.  Georgia on my mind.
@mbrogz13 @nypost agree
“@Joelsherman1: ICYMI Column 2 
@mbrogz13 read Joel Sherman today @nypost makes the perfect case for him. still say Hals asshole tightens &amp; he is a dodger, or worse Red Sox
@mbrogz13 me too.  Simple reason too.  He boss is 6 feet under.
@NFLguy07840 legendary music.  Timeless,

@NFLguy07840 my soul is prob 80, lol
@NFLguy07840 44
@jwelge96 wow.  That's a brilliant way to look at it.  Ty my friend.  I hadn't quantified it that way.
I could listen to nat king cole singing the telephone book all day long.
I just saw an ad in the @nypost for the @BelmontStakes.  That warms my soul.
Sinatra on @pandora_radio, newspapers everywhere, ice cold bud.  Good Sunday.  And it's not 15 below.  #SundayFunday
@GL0401 I just let a store without a coat on and said thank fucking god.  I was w my kids, didn't matter still said it.

Gotta be honest, this not giving a fuck is the  ultimate freedom
If @UrFaveLatina Latina can't eat, I'm going on a hunger strike starting right now. #solidarity
Sign moncada so I can buy into the rebuild.  #Yankees
@UrFaveLatina has a @rihanna fixation, @twitter has a #mila fixation.  I bet ours lasts way longer.
@jwelge96 teams like tampa kc and Oakland are going to the playoffs every year spending 75 mil.  Girardi will pay. Maybe unjustly.
@jwelge96 I see your point, but you can't miss three times in a row with an extra WC spot with 260 in payroll and survive #resultsbiz.
worry about cashmans closing ability.  When he is 40m over next offer he 
If girardi takes 750 million over three years and doesn't touch October, we will know Hal was his mothers bastard child.  Boss wasn't there.
Day one of what I believe, is a must make the playoffs for this girardi regieme.  #itsnotwhatyouwant.
Why would I be excited about capuano, CC, Evoldi broken wing tanaka reporting today.  Want us to buy in about a rebuild? Get #moncada #today
Mike rice is a moron.
@newkingofmedia I would think at that money testing is a must. Or the suspicions go up and the pricectag goes down.
Has #talbot given up any softies yet today?  #nyr. #playtheredhead.
@newkingofmedia at 80 million they will stick a camera up is ass if they want to.
@newkingofmedia belt tightening?  He made 350 million on tv alone last year @MLBNetwork reports, he wants us to spend he better spend.
Pitchers and catchers report to tampa and I care less.  Show me you mean business about this rebuild and sign #moncada #yankees.
@MLBNetwork reports that the #yankees make in excess of 350 mil a year from tv alone.  Hal better blow away #Moncada .
The drawing of the futuristic spaceship in la for the raiders and chargers was done simply to motivate Oakland and Sd to build stadiums.
Why the fuck do I live here?? Smh
Bud selig rubs me the wrong way. I like manfred.#MLB
I love baseball but the annual scouts dinner being televised on @MLBNetwork is insanity.
@Ash0urAdam talbot sux
Has mark teixera issued is annual winter "I'm never going to be 100%" statement yet?  #Yankees
Play Richie Cunningham.  #NYRangers #NYR #talbotsucks.
Talbot gave 6 goals to Vancouver's JV team.  Play the red head #Rangers
Talbot is brutal. #NYRangers
Now sadin brothers eat talbots lunch.  #NYR
Talbot is terrible.  You need 6 goals a game.  Put the 15 year old red head with the good hair in net, #NYR #NYRangers
If the @nba makes 3400 trades and nobody gives a fuck, do the trades still go through?  #bringbackbaseball

@sportsJC16 exactly.
@sportsJC16 whenever I hear the wilpons lost money w madoff I laugh hysterically.What did they do with the 35%returns for 2 decade?  Such bs
U don't add color to the Sistine chapel,don't straighten the tower Pisa, don't add enhancements to @UrFaveLatina.Masterpieces r masterpieces
39,700 people won't be in a good mood until @UrFaveLatina is back on her feet.  #getwellsoon.
The only group of people dumber than #arod, is the ny media who continue to obsess over him.
I know virtually nothing about the resteraunt business, but #RestaurantStartup is an addictive tv show @CNBC

@ChrisScandaglia the great borough of NJ lol
The amount of sleaze covering the PR guy that told #arod to do a hand written note is beyond any earthly measurement. #Yankees
#yankees are going to stall on this buyout like they are stalling on tanaka. Neither player will be In the dugout come 6/15. Save the tweet
@BigBadWolf_1 @Bxrich3 I really see no other way around this.
ST hasn't even started and the circus begins.  Pay the man to walk away and stop tarnishing the brand further.  #Yankees #arodapologies
Hey Alex this isn't complicated.  Hit and hit them far, or go home.  NY never loved you, will never love you.  It can't be more simple #arod
@BigBadWolf_1 people are sheep.
#Arod thinking going the hand written route thinking we think it's more sincere, is the craziest notion so far on 2015.  Mans insane.
@ChrisScandaglia @jwelge96 think they want to see what he has left.  If he can't touch fastballs (like he couldn't in oct 2013, he is gone.
@ChrisScandaglia @jwelge96 @AROD 40 mill to igawa didn't seem to be much off a concern.
@jwelge96 all profit and loss to Hal. Old man paid igawa 40 mill to piss the Red Sox off.  The kids won't spend 60 mil to protect the brand
#Arod simply cannot help himself.
Babe Ruth has more career complete games than randy Johnson.  Think about that,  #Baseball
@ChrisScandaglia I think they retire too many, but if Reggie is retired playing only 5 years, these 3 need to be.  What's your opinion ?
I finally get the #WestminsterDogShow the woman handlers need to be enormous and wear the ugliest shies known to mankind.

@jwelge96 mattingly hit a homer earlier in same game, The place shook.  That is when it was the best venue in sports.  Now it's a mall.
@jwelge96 I watch dodger games late night on the package just to listen to him.  I care less about anyone on the dodgers.
@jwelge96 I was at the leyritz game winner vs Seattle game 2.  14 inn 1995. Loudest I ever heard the stadium. I thought it was coming down.
@jwelge96 very shocking, but when brosious did it.  I thought I was dreaming.
@jwelge96 on one leg, lasorda grabbing at straws, vs hall of fame pitcher, vs a team odds on to win.  Great moment.  Better than carter.
@jwelge96 Gibson was crazier.  Toronto was winning that series anyway,  philly sucked.
@jwelge96 @MLBNetwork I will say the brosious homer on the second night, after tinos the night before was the most shocked I've ever been
@jwelge96 @MLBNetwork just really studied the 75 game 6, crazy homers, lead changes, crazy defensive plays, Fisk.  Maybe best game ever.
@jwelge96 @MLBNetwork joe carter has to be somewhere in mix.
The Kirk Gibson homer vs eckersly in 88 would be rejected by Hollywood movie producers for being too hokey and unbelievable. @MLBNetwork
Marvin miller not in the @BaseballHall is just ridiculous.  This one man changed the game more than any other since jackie Robinson. #MLB

@FranksYanks23 with fister in wash you know what your investing in.  Fister can win 18 this year.
@FranksYanks23 the turnover at the closer is too great to try to guess that he will end up with 45 saves,  just as likely to get 12.
@FranksYanks23 fister.  I never value closers, esp ones that have been closers for 15 mins.  They have a bad 3 days they lose the job.
#BobOdenkirk has a line of shit 44 miles long.  #BetterCallSaul

night Michael moonwalked at the Grammys in 84 people in the audience were screaming like someone was shot.Def psychopath,but a crazy talent
Michael Jackson   Billie Jean Live Grammy Award 1984 still the best grammy moment ever.  It all changed after this. 
@corrado_19 good point
Not a great #grammy night.  Annie Lennox had a great 6 minutes.  Rest was very forgettable
@corrado_19 really slow ending
I officially abhor this "stay with me"song.  I've heard it 49 time since 8:30 #GrammyAwards2015

@gymkoukla or any of 634 hits,  not this.
@gymkoukla woman's a godess, but perform what we love.  Spare me the church stuff.
Fuckin Beyoncé just sing bootylicious.  That is why we are staying up late.  #GrammyAwards2015
@CanesPhins @StantonSMASH was it that good?

@ggonzalez03 I'm so with you.
Prince, Dave grohl and Stevie wonder give awards out but Enrique's 4th cousin on his mothers side plays?  Makes sense,  #GrammyAwards2015
@mikev1975 excellent point
let me get this right, the #GRAMMMYs had Dave grohl say Ty to lederman &amp; Stevie play the harmonica?  Guys these 2 dudes can play ya know..
@gymkoukla thought so too.
@ggonzalez03 nope.  Amazing band.  You my friend know music.
Get it off.
Only thing I see in my head to this song are two dudes piping one another, #GrammyAwards2015
This wins the award for the most homo song of the night.  #GrammyAwards2015

#SamSmith and #MeganTrainor ever had a kid, they still don't have enough cash to afford the future plastic surgery bill.  Make more hits,
@gymkoukla don't get it, lol
What  the fuck is wrong w my tv?  #GrammyAwards2015
Horrible song, worse whatever you wanna call this interpretation of it.  #GrammyAwards2015
Kelly ripa sings this shitty song?  Had no idea,  #GrammyAwards2015
@pstrif lol
The producers of the #Grammys have obviously figured 10:35 est is the audience low point, so they put Enrique's 4th cousin on.
Every awards show needs a thick Latina to come out and completely butcher a cue card.  #GrammyAwards2015
If they gave #GRAMMMYs based on masculinity, #SamSmith wouldn't be let in the building.  He would be parking cars outside. Has pipes though
#maryjblige will be fantasic.  When isn't she?  #GrammyAwards

Church of baseball opens today in the 07869. Baseball ratings in 15 minutes.  I get to pitch to 600 kids.  #BaseballBegins
@JEspo0022 he does have the best numbers, but not ever playing vs, blacks in my opinion hurts him.  Still amazing career.
@d_rauen just amazed that the home run king has 3000 hits before factoring the 755 homers,  crazy stat.
@d_rauen the batting average diff is the walk rate
@d_rauen retread the tweet.  I said back out the homers.  I not debating the players.
In 1923 babe Ruth got up 700 times,  and reached base safely 54 percent of the time.  #wtf
Babe Ruth never struck out more than 100 times in a season.  He walked less than 100 timees, only 4x when he became an everyday player.
@RobbinsDynasty and is 50 games over 500 with 94 wins
Take away hank Aaron's 755 homers and he still has 3000 hits. Take away babe Ruth's 715 hrs he has just over 2000 hits.  #baseballhistory
@JoeGiglioSports Philly in excellent shape with this two teams having shaky rotations.
@JoeGiglioSports @ScottMillerBbl yes.  Yankees maybe too if the rotation falls apart.
@bulls_jaden @uSTADIUM Joey Harrington.
@JoeGiglioSports @ScottMillerBbl I think hamels will be a Red Sox, deep pockets, need an ace, several prospects.  Seems a fit to me,
@JoeGiglioSports @ScottMillerBbl oh yes I see.
@JoeGiglioSports @ScottMillerBbl you thought Phil's were in on shields?
@TheBigEasy5889 good one.  Parades too.
@BigBadWolf_1 u me both bro.  Why does life have to be 110 mph always?
Stop obsessing over the pace of the game of baseball.  You need a frenetic night out, go do cocaine in the bathroom of roller derby.  #MLB
Love the fact that #February has only 28 days, and 7 are already over.
I don't get boat shoes.  At all.
@corrado_19 that guy under married.   Banged every beautiful woman alive and ended up w her.
@BeschlossDC @pgammo wrinkled mess the babe was.
Nobody can take away vandermeers back to back no hitters, biut across 250 decisions he was 2 games under .500. #baseballhistorylesson.
Pete gray, St. Louis browns, 1945 struck out 11 times in 230 at bats.  He had 1 arm.  No shit.  Different game then.
Amazed in 1945 we had the wherewithal to create the atom bomb, but not the common sense to invent batting helmets.  #baseball @MLBNetwork
If I were ted Williams and had his talents, I'd want to be frozen too.  #justincase.
after leaving the game as best hitter ever,becoming a war hero, Williams later in life became widely known as the planets best fly fisherman
@96liverpudlians out of your mind,
Ted Williams drove in 1800 runs hit 521 homers,  lost nearly 2000 at bats to war, Where he became a pilot and shot down the enemy routinely
@NFLguy07840 it's mind boggling.  Like the stats I'm reading are lies.
@TheBigEasy5889 how about a war of almost 11!!!!!!!!!!
@TheBigEasy5889 unbelievable.  Every single stat you can look at.
Ted Williams career on base % over 19 years was .482, 38 points higher than PED bloated Barry bonds.  #insane.
@jwelge96 on base was .550, ops just shy of 1300 finished second.  It's almost funny.
@jwelge96 imagine hitting 406 and not winning the MVP?
@jwelge96 yes he was.
1941, DiMaggio hit in 56 games, with 91 hits, and he struck out 5 times in 10 weeks.  Simply crazy.
1941 DiMaggio  hit safely in 72 of 73 games.  That's outragous.
1941 joe DiMaggio struck out 13 times.  Think about that.  It's once every 2 weeks throughout a 6 month season.  #Baseball
If there was a channel called #kenburns #Baseball I would throw away my remote.  @MLBNetwork
