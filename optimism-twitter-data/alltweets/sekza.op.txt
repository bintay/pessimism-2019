You open a restaurant with 50different gourmet dishes and folks will order wings and ask for the wine menu -_______-
Mla made such a valid point there, you have the cash but you feel its more economic to buy nandos and not eat at tashas,but u like iAmbience
@Mlacash hahahaha cabanga! Its the culture! but they will go sit at tashas &amp; order Ice Tropez for an Instagram pic,&amp; not order food! -__-
@Mlacash i hear you bru.
@Mlacash depends on the business, restaurants are meant to serve and profit through food, not alcohol.
@Mlacash do you think thats what they aimed 4in the beginning?Or did they shit from cocktail bar and eatery to Club becos of change in crowd
@Mlacash i beg 2differ, i know of Gourment restaurants that have been operating for yeeeears that most blacks only knew abt the past 2years
Gateway Tashas &gt; 

Especially on Events' weekends LOL
@Khithah how? Utilise the deck area as well? Entrance from which side? The deck area stays hidden which i think sucks
Dreams sold lol 
@Mlacash in gourmet restaurants and cafès in pmb...
@Mlacash they do, just North of pmb (ngamlas) lol
@Mlacash then the  "only-rock-up-to-have-drinks" crowd starts flocking in and things go downhill from there.
@Mlacash heres the thing, you move it to the that area,u attract a particular crowd(those who actually spend and appreciate signature menus)
@LekohD_ spend on food, they spend thousands on alcohol though, which usually kills most of the restaurants cos their markUp aint in alcohol
@LekohD_ reason being?
@Intemnandi from what i hear its closed.
@Intemnandi ive also always loved that location. I was so optimistic when cappellos opened, alot cudve been done with that spot.
@Khithah i feel you.
@Khithah why not?
...or will it, just like most trendy restaurant franchises that come to PMB, be misused and turned into social spots...
But then again the more important question is: wud the consumers treat it for its MAIN purpose(food eatery)  &amp; support it accordingly??
Would the Cappelos spot in PMB be a good Tashas location? #Twoogle

@Mbe_swa nah dawg, i let it go awhile ago, so shud they and stop subbinng me cos the truth is black and white, no grey area here
Some people feel a false sense of entitlement EVEN WHEN ITS UNNECESSARY....
My family was excluded from my engagement celebrations, it was all for my friends &amp;inner circle but you didn't see my FAMILY bitching abt it
@Q_china i robbed ALL my friends, all of yall, it wasnt personal. I took a very conscious decision to have it Family only, it was for THEM
Some people cannot hang out with you in PUBLIC anymore because of the things they've said to ppl abt you in PRIVATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its NOT beef if im not aware of it, you just HAD/HAVE an issue with me that you STILL havent been man enuf to sit down and discuss with me
The same people you were telling that we're beefing, are now saying "kanti ngempela what is his issue,its been months now really,mature up"
Im not calling anyone a snake, but while you called me "a fake friend" i kept quiet and let time reveal the truth.
When the grass is cut THE SNAKES WILL SHOW.

how do you take offense and personalise an act that was NEVER meant to hurt you in the first place, NEVER directed at you at all??
Being the better person and not fighting fire with fire, keeping quiet while being called a "fake" friend has revealed alot of truth...
Time has shown where the heart really was. I never seeked approval and let/acknowledged  all my friends who came forth abt this matter....
But like ive said before, i never re-act prematurely..ive let it be. Subtweets, statuses and words on the street,i never retaliated....
He has however, never returned numerous attempts to have a civil convo  abt it, instead i hear things that are said in the streets....
Till today the reason still baffles me. All my friends who felt uncomfortable abt this matter have sat down with me and we've spoken abt it
Actually dreamt of a friend who ain't cool with me no more. He was like a brother to me, but he decided to cut me off over sum dumb isht.

@Q_china so dont call other kids "slaves" too. <GRINNING FACE>
A BCom graduate gets a JOB at a environmental institution because ECONOMY. Like i said early, respect the process.dont call it slavery
@Q_china you statement was "when some graduates they start their career path" FALSE, not all the tym and its not certain, BECAUSE ECONOMY
@king_bhubesi Thank You. And THIS is what the entrepreneurs dont tell people!!!!!
@Q_china kzn twitter <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> LMAO pew pew
@Q_china WORKING FOR SOMEONE IS SLAVERY FOR SURVIVAL? <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> i rest my case. So a CEO of a OIL company(employed by the founders) is a slave?
@Q_china FALSE. Graduates can hold jobs and non-graduates can persue careers. Its not black and white as we think,hence IN-HOUSE training!!
@Q_china true, but retract ur statement abt slavery cos that wud mean you dont respect/acknowledge the PROCESS. Its a process homie
The average "millionaire" (so they say) has multiple sources of income. And you will find that they are infact EMPLOYED somewhere
@Q_china i cannot argue with that, very valid point.
The average entrepreneur gets paid LESS than 12 times in their first 24months in business. (Cont)
That concept refers to supplementing ur salary with another source of income, not telling ur boss where to get off and quitting. (Cont)
A concept people misquote is "i cant get paid 12 times a year".....(cont)
Lol that tym im 5 to sleeping lol 
@Q_china who defines "growth" in this context; the job or the fact that they didnt study ?
The biggest misconceptions:
1. People holding jobs are unmotivated
2. Entrepreneurs are businessmen
3. Getting paid 12tym a year is bad
@Mbe_swa let me go to bed <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Q_china Most careers stem from JOBS...hence the term JOB SATISFACTION. You hold multiple jobs in your career, its a process, not slavery
@Q_china i beg to differ. 9-5 "job" (as you put it) doesn't necessarily mean slavery....

@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu do u know people who pay corkage fee contribute less to the function than a person who bought a cheap bottle there
@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu hosts allow corkage fee for special occasions , you cant expect to ALWAYS pay corkage and bring ur own booze
@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu you referring to paying corkage fee ? You do know that That doesnt benefit the host at all?
@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu "history is the best predictor of future behaviour"
You stock that brand and ppl dont buy a single bottle
@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu. Thats what GUESTLISTS are for. At the discretion of the host, cos TRUST me the host knows who spends &amp; who doesnt
@ItsKonoMngane come again?
@Mlacash @SandisoMthembu Mla define big spender?
@SandisoMthembu @Mlacash DUDE! You asking for me to give me R1000. And when you get to VIP what will you do ke?
You basically asking for me to pay R250 for you. Its cool yes i can. We then get to vip(which you have asked for). NOW WHAT????
"Awenze amaDwadla" is easy to say...but do you understand wat it already implies to the person you requesting from.
<EYES> 
Its hightime people respect the work that goes into putting in an event. PAY FOR THE FUN YOU HAVE.
The 3 check points had people thinking they could beat the system lol come to the 2nd check point and isht gets real LMAO #TheRVVL18AprilPMB
People know abt events a month in advance, but come the day, they call me,not even the host, to organise access. #TheRVVL18AprilPMB

@Mbe_swa cos your FOCUS IS GETTING A JOB AND NOT STARTING UR OWN BUSINESS after qualification

@Mbe_swa hawu!! JABS? when? Show me....
@Mlacash 
@Mbe_swa which is what exactly lol? You've changed topics 3 tyms: took a shot at humanities, dissed travel&amp;tourism and promoted Engineering
@Mbe_swa ayt homie <WINKING FACE>

@Mlacash @Mbe_swa i aint tryna prove him wrong, just putting FACTS out. <GRINNING FACE>
@Mbe_swa give me a specific qualification and i'll tell you.... Humanities is a broad faculty
@Mbe_swa then you shud have stated 20tweets earlier that the following tweets relate to YOUR field and not in general. LOL
@Mbe_swa are we now talking abt a SPECIFIC qualification?
@Nomakha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> please dont, im busy lol
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> duude! 
Must be nice Lol 
@Mbe_swa the point is???? Relate this to your initial argument abt redundant qualification
@Mbe_swa <FLUSHED FACE> you didnt just say this bru..... Almost ALL qualifications incorporate a module for business relations.
@Mbe_swa name a degree that YOU feel shud be phased out &amp; i'll tell you why it shudnt!The problem is we study to get EMPLOYED, &amp; not EMPLOYE
@Mbe_swa different topic altogether! And on that note you weren't starting something in line with the qualification u possess.
@Mbe_swa hence South Africa promotes ENTREPRENEURSHIP. Study and then start sumthing to CREATE jobs, not look for employement urself
@Mbe_swa so u would rather have a crowded pool of singular graduates in the country....WRONG MOVE again. Diversity builds
@Mbe_swa is the ultimate/only goal for studying drama to be on TV screen?
@Mbe_swa i beg to differ.
@Mbe_swa because after graduation we use the same avenues to get employment: WRONG MOVE. No accredited qualification is a waste!
