Less news voices equal worse coverage of actual news, and modern TV news is dreadful at that to begin with.

They also have more news time (read local sales inventory) than their competitors, they just killed off WISH as a news competitor.
AND they have all of the popular syndicated programming with 59 and 4 (Seinfeld, Big Bang Theory, etc). Significant revenue.

@NealTaflinger Love to chat about it. I am sharing a frustration most politicos have. I am just dumb enough to tweet it.
@NealTaflinger In the past, some reporters didn't and it hurt the paper.
@NealTaflinger With all due respect I've worked in politics for 10 years so I am aware of what happens in my industry.
@NealTaflinger But hopefully with the retooling, coverage improves in 2014 vs. what it has been in the past.
@NealTaflinger If you look at the politics section, it's fairly anemic and uninspiring. But it's December.
People might find government and politics interesting once their paper did.
Maybe more citizens would vote if their main source of info gave politics the level of examination, explanation &amp; analysis sports gets.
Only Tully and Smith discuss anything quasi-political or something that directly impacts the majority of Hoosiers.
