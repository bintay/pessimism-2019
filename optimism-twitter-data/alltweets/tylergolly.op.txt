@JamesStaszuk @ShawTVEdm I've done that too but only the first 50 minutes were recorded...really wanted to see the full Team TT of the Giro
Anyone else recording Giro d'Italia on @ShawTVEdm &amp; have it stop on them? This may be the last straw. Happens too often. I need to watch it.
I want awesome and fun things like this in #yeg. @chase_jeff &amp; #citylabyeg @artsedmonton can we make this happen? 
Watching the @giroditalia! Go @ryder_hesjedal and team @Ride_Argyle! Making me want to ride my bike...and getting pumped for @TourOfAlberta!
@BeerGeeks_YEG have fun! @RMoncrieffBeer &amp; crew are passionate about beer. Had tons of fun the other weekend making Great White Combine!!

It's been great seeing the coverage and interest in the #yegbike protected lanes from across the country. #yeg &amp; #yyc are rising as leaders!

@RJSCity one was built along 97 Street in Hazeldean a couple years ago. Part of 83 Ave east 99 St is a bike boulevard which ties into 97 St.
@RJSCity sounds like a great idea. Looking forward to it and talking about city building more broadly.
@RJSCity lots of factors to consider in design including climate, operations, safety and community needs. Learning is big part of my process
@JRMarlow easier snow clearance and maintenance part if protected bike lane rationale.
@RJSCity protected lane against north curb.
@RJSCity based on technical analysis and public engagement, protected bike lanes. Parking remains. Traffic calmed.
@CALLIDUSDevMgmt @LauraOsmanCBC channeling my inner Don Draper.

@andreagudbier @edmontonbicycle reminded me a lot of the design that Calgary has. Pretty sure clearing would use trail equipment plus trucks
@graemebone @edmontonbicycle there was painted crossing zone where cars yield to bikes travelling through. Right turns to right of bike lane
@DaleCalkins @onishenko making left turns or right turns on a bike is a little tricky. Especially with lots of people walking &amp; biking.
@DaleCalkins @onishenko the centre location removes a bunch of conflicts with transit and right turning vehicles. Is uncommon though.
@DaleCalkins @onishenko where I was seemed to have bollard or armadillos to separated the lanes from traffic.

@KalenAnderson @chase_jeff @_cingraham I got 8/10. Did you do the one based on transit systems?
@OScadeng Hence the need to restrict right turns on red for pedestrian safety in #yegdt. Those aren't allowed in New Zealand &amp; works great.
@timquerengesser I had emailed with them too. Seemed like a decent product.
Thoughts? #yegwalk MT @BrentToderian: What an ergonomic crosswalk that accounts for pedestrian behaviour looks like. 
@timquerengesser Interested in working with this product this year to introduce it in #yeg? 
@mattdance @acmemeatmarket When is supper? ;)
Could construction for the #yegdt portion of Valley Line LRT not be done in 1st/2nd year to limit impacts on festivals/residents/businesses?
My weekend routine of brunch at Commodore has restarted. Missed this place. #yegdt

@markboulter @edmontonpolice Look at tweets from @MetroSteph covering press conference.
Comments from @edmontonpolice calling out #yegbike lanes $ not evenly remotely appropriate. Building a safe city needs multiple approaches.
Interesting comments about Council funding decisions on the EPS request. Few departments increasing staff to meet challenges of growing #yeg
@MetroSteph Interesting since bike lanes increase safety for road users. Currently 100s of collisions per yr 
#yegsafety #holisticapproach
@timquerengesser @jkparker I think the lack of people living in the area contributed as well. Toronto is much denser meaning more support.

@JulieKusiek Pay as you go. I believe it is property tax. @waltersyeg or @ben_hen would likely be able to provide more clarity.
I have a pile of CDs that I need to get rid of from a couple old bands. Any ideas #yeg? Can they be recycled?
@TheGrillGeek @EdmontonOilers @DavisonMurray he offered A Lot. Will await your counter offer.

Who knew? @globeandmail: Green energy sector jobs surpass total oil sands employment 
@DavisonMurray @EdmontonOilers Seriously, I was thinking gag gift. Jan 4 NYI, Jan 29 Sabres, Apr 4 Flames. Islanders would be fun to watch.
And of course I still have three @EdmontonOilers games to "sell" that I can't go to. Not liking my chances. Anyone interested? #Discount?
@EdmontonOilers Guy left them with someone, they didn't want it, took them to pub manager who gave to someone else &amp; he stayed at the pub
How bad are the @EdmontonOilers right now? I was at the pub yesterday &amp; a guy literally could not give away free tickets. Ouch. #Oilers
I thought for sure the camera was going to pull back and buddy was going to literally be combing the desert.
Ok, so I watched the trailer for #StarWarsEpisodeVII and swore it was a spoof at the beginning or a trailer for a new Space Balls. #wishing?
@ryan_batty me neither. They need a touchdown at some point.
@ryan_batty hahaha
@ryan_batty interesting. How's being off leash for the weekend?! From Twitter, looks good so far!
