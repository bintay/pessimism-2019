From the The Globe and Mail, #DealWithIt #abndp #abpoli 
True our MLAs are far from perfect. If all you look for is the bad that's all you'll see and you'll probably find plenty. 1/2
But, I rather look for the good because optimism is better than despair. 2/2 #abndp

Progressive Conservative is always progressive in the beginning and conservative in the end when things matter the most. #abvote #abndp
@cherylanne, @DoctorCanBob is also my guy. But our area is one of the toughest seat to win. #abndp
An election as close and historic as this one, every vote matters. #abvote #abndp
Dear @TheTweetOfGod: My @packers lost. @MannyPacquiao lost. Please don't let @RachelNotley and the @albertaNDP lose. Amen. #abvote #abndp
Have no mistake, choosing @AlbertaPC is choosing the past not the future. #abvote #abndp
No. It's not about punishment and it's never an accident. It's about doing what is right and always meant to be. #abvote #abndp #notleycrue
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. #abndp
The Tories are relying on Alberta's fear of change. My @albertaNDP is relying on courage to hope for a better tomorrow. #abvote #abndp
@vineshpratap @GlobalEdmonton Interesting. I'm all over this topic too.
I entered to win a free @Diablo #TreasurePack to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of #D3RoS, and you can too! 
@rickygervais Actually, they do test for steroids:
