@shunter86 @pattonmeister @theriffmarn that was pre 'I feared for my life' defence. They are softer now though
@pattonmeister @theriffmarn to me intent is only doing that if the ball has gone. Like after a scrum or something
@pattonmeister @shunter86 @theriffmarn intentional is stupid to have. Yeah same I reckon 3 if they challenge
@pattonmeister @theriffmarn Blair wasn't exactly standing still. How can they prove he heard the whistle? I think they will go careless
@theriffmarn if they grade it as intentional &amp; he proves it's not can they re charge him?
@tenash921 have the 3 soccer games in July sold out? 3 x 90k crowds to soccer of course they'd be worried
@tenash921 he's right AFL hates soccer. AFL knows it's the only footy code that can take over Melb
@boozerothfield @buzzrothfield @evinpriest haha. Yes you know the $100k they are only was really crippling them
@pattonmeister hopefully they win so to make the trip better. If I didn't clean up on the tab result would of wrecked mine haha
@sweetandsoward I think Souths &amp; Cowboys will be in the GF so pick them both every week
@sweetandsoward I need Souths to win for a perfect round but hope Dragons win
@sweetandsoward 2 sets? Might need them for the footy aswell
@sweetandsoward got the streamers ready?
@natetaylor87 have you seen our draw? We lose this week. Sadly put a pen through us for 2015
@sweetandsoward should be a great game
@sweetandsoward good night. Good luck for your last test tomorrow
@bostonnnnnn nope F1 is on
@shunter86 what a shame that would be... Burn that shithole down
@EverclearBand you guys are rocking tonight
Everclear are going off. Brings back so much memories
@sweetandsoward finally will be finished
@sweetandsoward so do I. Perfect round coming my way!
@amarief10 don't we already have every kiwi over here in NYC teams?
@jackdorrigo1917 @shunter86 Merrin would be on atleast 500k. The players going after they get replace by min wage. Don't come near that
@westsydneysport @7th_tackle @telegraph_sport @theriffmarn I'd say walk away.
@shunter86 I don't see how we can. Him &amp; Latimore. Just depression due to being bi sexual
if we were to lose Idris. It would help re-sign crucial players
@bostonnnnnn need them both to get my 5 leg multi up
@shunter86 I said it at the time Merrin while a good player will cost us Brown etc. Idris leaving fixes that
@shunter86 If the rumours about his personal life is true. No wonder he can't get settled
@shunter86 I think he needs the structure footy brings. Team wise would free up some cash
@sweetandsoward nah won't lose them. Merrin going frees up plenty of space
@suthodan haha
@jesssm84 mmm...yes they are
@suthodan are all over my time line....best part of the weekend haha
@chloem1296 32D?
@badel_cmail @sharkydave44 After going there last night. It's a piece of shit so no surprise
@sandylanceley @gus10gould @intlrl @smhsport @thehutch81 Yep. Good to see interest peak in tests. Other ways to get the same result
@sweetandsoward I will try to remember on the actual day haha
@sweetandsoward Happy birthday for 5 months time
@sharkydave44 @bluey18713 @suthodan Say 3 years. The core of the side looks good. You guys have the 2nd worse 7 in the comp. He will be gone
@amarief10 Haha prob the same fuckwits saying Peachey's was last night. Both will go but not for that reason
@sharkydave44 @bluey18713 @suthodan The yr Gallen &amp; Flanno goes. You will win the comp. Flanno to conservative
@sharkydave44 @bluey18713 @suthodan Brown gives you that class. He's fit puts Bird in the centres gives them strike aswell
@suthodan @mitch_j_hooper The problem is teams need a half they go to proven failures rather then kids with promise.
@gc_anthony @sharkydave44 week off came at a bad time. Sometimes it's the worst for momentum
@sweetandsoward I have 5. Need Manly, Storm &amp; Souths for perfect round
@sharkydave44 @gc_anthony yep just one of those games. Meet a team on fire
@normyzee @juanfarkall @thecraigbrown haha. The rorts on somewhere for them to win
@gc_anthony @sharkydave44 haha. you wasn't given false hopes during the game... Far better
@normyzee 90% of the referee 'issues' are due to the VR. Should be a challenge system only
@normyzee @juanfarkall @thecraigbrown shh... You are interrupting a brave GWS performance
@thecraigbrown @juanfarkall @normyzee yep. That's a try on the fact alone
@sharkydave44 I said it last night. Would rather be smashed then lose in the last min
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley once they got their chance they took it. KK getting injured forced Seg to play 80. Team was better for it
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley who got dropped for those players to debut? Injuries have forced the hand sadly
@sharkydave44 yep. Sir Sowie found that out last night.
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn Another coach would of tried him. Ivan plays it safe. Hard to say what's right or not
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley Moylan/Austin both showed this skill in NSW Cup. Austin was seen as a centre &amp; Moylan told to look elsewhere.
@sandylanceley my theory is if you struggle in a position &amp; have a young guy... Play him can't go worse
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley do you know a Panthers that didn't want Austin in the side? I don't
@sandylanceley I think they hold back too much at times. Moylan was pretty gone before he debut aswell
@sandylanceley yep. Sowie just kick. Austin just run
@sandylanceley yep. If we have JT &amp; let him go fine. But Burns/Walsh FFS.
@sweetandsoward haha. Need a I am a westie shirt or something
@sweetandsoward haha. showing your true westie
@sweetandsoward haha. Need practice up on those words then
@sweetandsoward haha. So Monday you will see if it comes true?
@jackdorrigo1917 @andy_seags @yeoldeguildford so many rules are though. That's why the frustration is there
@juanfarkall @sharkydave44 @unlikelynrlnews Peachey to use the 'I was shocked he actually ran the ball' excuse?
@ccleary_ Can, NZ &amp; NQ
@jackdorrigo1917 @andy_seags @yeoldeguildford the 7 tackles now means. It happens most weeks that's what fired Ivan up.
@notbreerose the dude gets to perve on that sexy piece of arse the queen.... Dream job more like!
@jackdorrigo1917 @andy_seags both sides had points though. Maybe the rules but only twice been called drop out
@notbreerose you have just ensured the place will be packed
@notbreerose
@sweetandsoward haha. We will call you Tyrone
@andy_seags @mickyt1985 @shunter86 by the time everyone's back in form the gap will be too great
@andy_seags @mickyt1985 @shunter86 play Melb &amp; Souths twice. Tricky games at B0, LO &amp; Canberra
@andy_seags @mickyt1985 @shunter86 I don't see us making the 8. Nothing to do with the refs
@andy_seags @cruzie06 @mickyt1985 @shunter86 Blair was still fighting in the tackle. So must not of heard the whistle
@pattonmeister @suthodan It's a strange one. You'd see 1 of those every game yet never called. Not sure people know it exists
@pattonmeister @sweetandsoward we needed him to play so he's right for the bastard run we have coming
@sweetandsoward Yeah just one of those nights nothing went our way
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 @joshrobbo44 @yeoldeguildford Seems like 1 of those stupid rules that is up to the refs decretion
@sweetandsoward yes was one of the shining lights out there
@sharkydave44 @joshrobbo44 They were plenty of actual Checcin stuff ups and ppl focus on a correct call
@ccleary_ Was terrible to watch at the game. Worse then Manly last year
@theriffmarn @jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister Yeah saved a couple tonight
@suthodan we did well to even be a chance to win that. The fact we finished with 13 on the field shows we have nothing to complain about
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister @sharkydave44 any knee injury is 6months or so.
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 @sharkydave44 Peachey won't be at his best til next yr after his injury last yr.
@pattonmeister @aussieblackwell @jackdorrigo1917 @shunter86 Fifita's was down graded &amp; worse then Paulo who got 9 weeks
@sharkydave44 I'd play him there. Fuck Wallace off
@pattonmeister @aussieblackwell @jackdorrigo1917 @shunter86 Blair wasn't exactly standing still. After Luke last yr who knows
@sharkydave44 takes 6 months after the injury he had. No one else to come in though
@aussieblackwell @jackdorrigo1917 @mdoyle08 @pattonmeister @shunter86 I would of sent him &amp; a 5 week holiday. Who knows these days
@stuart_maurice wait til the 2nd half. He's dreadful
@amarief10 he should of been sent off. Proof that the send off is dead
@stuart_maurice he gets far worse
@aussieblackwell @jackdorrigo1917 @mdoyle08 @pattonmeister @shunter86 no one gets 6 without loading. Id say 3
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 was far from hopeless but pretty much just kicked only
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister wouldn't say carved up. We scored no tries but well as you can expect 1st up
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 I never doubted they should be favourite. 3 points shows more to the $1.80-$2.20 I said
well it was a loss but that's the committment we need every week boys. Wins will come as players comeback
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 the scored showed otherwise. Was always going to be a close game if we defended well. We did
great win in NYC @penrithpanthers. Now time to get the points here too
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 0-3 away. 1 of them had 60% possess. Maybe if we sowie we win stats aren't always right
great start @penrithpanthers keep it going
@njc829103 @boozerothfield that will last him til the news maybe
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister $2.20 us. $1.80 them is prob where the betting should be. Punters are just fixing that
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 have you seen the Broncs bench? No Thaiday. ET gives us 50 odd tackles. $315 was too long
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 I don't think ppl expect him to be. Even 4 quality touches a half we are better off then without him
@ccleary_ @chickoonaroll haha. Good plan will be at the game. Both grades will be great games
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 I think he will be 3rd option most sets. The difference is he can get involved when needed
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister I have more concern over Moylan playing with a broken hand then Sowie playing
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 would Boyd rather John/Smith kick to him or Sowie to the corners?
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister yep. We only need him to take over on tackle 5. We have been ok elsewhere without him
@pattonmeister yep. Only been out for 6 weeks. We just need his kicking game for now. The others will do the rest
@rugbyleaguenews @sweetandsoward yep. The god has returned. Now just need him in a blue jersey
@pattonmeister @leaguefreak @wallyfrogmore they already have 35 jerseys. What's 1 more
@pattonmeister @leaguefreak @wallyfrogmore hence why they want the NZ spine at the club
@sianstevens4 yes happy hour... The 2nd best words in the english language
@sweetandsoward ahh good. If we go well I won't ruin it for you
@sweetandsoward you waiting til 930? Or getting scores live? I hate these games
@sweetandsoward I will lose my shit when I see him actually warm up with the team about 7.10 tonight
@Amarief10 Whare I wouldn't rule out. We need money to keep Brown
@sweetandsoward 7 weeks too long!!
@sweetandsoward I imagine you are
@sweetandsoward I did mine on the plane... hope so too
@ccleary_ on form it's not. Surely Roosters will get back into form though
@Amarief10 Good that he cheered you up abit
@sweetandsoward haha. 10 mins cram sessions = easy tests
@sweetandsoward haha. Study late worked
@orangeemptyseat @boozerothfield the @nhl can fuck off if we choke
@njc829103 @TheRiffMarn @JamesSmith1001 Come on. Things only ever happen in RL and in no other sport
@Andy_Seags Sutton &amp; Walker back even without Reynolds they win
@LeagueFreak they can take him... I won't care
@orangeemptyseat yeah but SBS doesn't have the budget to go elsewhere and say more stories...Any city in Australia has similar stories
@orangeemptyseat true but a 3 part series so no doubt will show the full story at the end
@sweetandsoward Haha. Ok I am hoping
@Notbreerose Pizza Hut
@Notbreerose He should be thankiful. He wasn't made someone's bitch...
@Notbreerose  call 1300 749 924... They will help you
@sweetandsoward haha. you watch this will your best test result.. Always the case
@Jackdorrigo1917 @UncyD @Andy_Seags Can they access education? Can they access medical treatment?
@UncyD @Jackdorrigo1917 @Andy_Seags yep. I have 10 or so ppl cancel appts with various agencies the last 2 days.
@Sharkydave44 Great. I will put even more money on us then
@sweetandsoward The quicker its here the quicker it's over
@cmw12_ If you are going to break the rules... Atleast look hot doing it
@andrewlahz @andy_seags @jackdorrigo1917 @uncyd of course but on the SBS budget they could only focus on 1 area.
@njc829103 @normyzee he didn't know &amp; can't handle that...haha funny
@andrewlahz @andy_seags @jackdorrigo1917 @uncyd given the budget of SBS it was done in 1 Suburb...could be in any city
@jackdorrigo1917 @andrewlahz @andy_seags @uncyd I will pass judgement after we see all 3 episodes.
Ready to board my plane now Mr Jetstar.... To see this fine looking human get us the win 
@TheNRLFixer @normyzee @BradWalterSMH Quite sad really. He doesn't need to know everything
@Andy_Seags @SianStevens4 I two
@nikkers4you I am having my 1st airport beer....always tastes so good!
@sweetandsoward now we have speed out wide can't wait to see him putting them in gaps
@normyzee wouldn't say a no name. He lost to someone ranked higher...doesn't make him less of a knob though
@sweetandsoward as long as he wakes up ok. He has his boots &amp; that so I'd say he will play
@sianstevens4 haha. I so write the wrong then or Than to set off my grammar nazis
@sweetandsoward Broncos have a few out &amp; can't score points. Soward plays we win.
@sweetandsoward sucks it's the delay game for our fans. Luckily I will be at the game
@andy_seags @jackdorrigo1917 @uncyd I work in CS &amp; see it all the time. Good to get publicity for it
@sweetandsoward footy day Friday...the best type
@sianstevens4 Haha. I would hope not. My daughter likes the same thing
@qldpanthers @sowwowofficial @sweetandsoward You don't carry 2 heavy bags onto a plane if you don't plan on playing
@sianstevens4 haha. Not the weirdest fetish I have heard
@sdbhjelm @joannalester @rl_ratings @westsydneysport we need to make it more enticing to stay with those countries
@westsydneysport @joannalester @rl_ratings of course but all would be Aust eligible. I fail to see how it makes the minnows better
@thehutch81 @thecraigbrown @therealsteavis need to get more nations to tier 1. how this makes that happen is beyond me
@aussieblackwell dude it's the warriors. They will find some way to stuff it
@aussieblackwell @niles1991 @sharkydave44 especially after losing Koroisau this season
@amarief10 Wait she sold a book of shelfies that people can see for free on her twitter? Haha
@joeljpienmunne1 @aussieblackwell not a shock NZ want him. A shock he is being let go
@mitch_j_hooper @wallyfrogmore that's why I don't watch. Sunday footy show is fine. Thursday night is terrible
@uncyd haha. No respect these days
@joeljpienmunne1 @aussieblackwell Brown didn't play. My bet SKD to Canberra
@sandylanceley @footyfacts37 @thecraigbrown Yep. We can do a 1 country for like or the very least have a standing down period
@joeljpienmunne1 @aussieblackwell he denied speaking with anyone. No doubt will sign elsewhere any week now
@thehutch81 @sandylanceley @therealsteavis &amp; have players miss tests to play for another countries state. doesn't fix the problem either
@sandylanceley @thehutch81 @therealsteavis spot on. I love that Radradra can never play for Aust. Gives fiji real star power
@njc829103 @thecraigbrown plenty now aren't anglo. Jennings, Papalli etc. However all want to wear the green &amp; gold
@thecraigbrown yeah not his finest statement. I don't care who they play for but SOO is for Aust players
@joannalester @rl_ratings @westsydneysport if say Radradra had a great series. You don't think Aust would pick him?
@sianstevens4 nope. I don't have an account on either for a reason
@jackdorrigo1917 @andy_seags I look at the stuff but never RT it. Just wrong others can choose to do it or not
@sandylanceley @anna2533 @therealsteavis yep nothing to do with it at all. Affects McGuire &amp; Napa aswell
@wallyfrogmore @andy_seags @jackdorrigo1917 yeah having boobs in mine gets them coming my way too
@andy_seags Yeah they never do. I accidentally followed one back had like 50 DM's an hour
@andy_seags yeah it's crazy I get them daily. I look if I can't see a common link blocked
@sweetandsoward I stayed with nokia but my tablet is samsung &amp; so would be my next phone
@andy_seags  @wallyfrogmore I like my sport less scripted.... Oh &amp; some blood if a fucker cops a chair to the head
@sianstevens4 you had me at vegemite. You lost me at avocado
@sweetandsoward ah welcome to the non iphone life....it's great!
@niles1991 @jackdorrigo1917 @mdoyle08 or Tonie Carroll remember then forgets a few years later
@shunter86 @sharkydave44 I thought it was Yeo
@niles1991 @jackdorrigo1917 @mdoyle08 everyone has a foreign parent when there's a test series on
@qldpanthers @sweetandsoward I will be up there tomorrow. 9am flight
@niles1991 @jackdorrigo1917 @mdoyle08 all Aust born &amp; changed nations
@mdoyle08 @jackdorrigo1917 @niles1991 @theriffmarn CvC didn't take players Austral did.
@normyzee yes. He's one of those people that you would be tempted to punch in the head
@sweetandsoward I am sure it can't be noticed
@nikkers4you I have to pack for me tonight
@sweetandsoward have you used new shampoo or something
@sweetandsoward getting your winter coat maybe?
@normyzee @njc829103 of course. Canberra's 1 of the richest clubs in the game but are terrible on field &amp; ppl don't watch them. Needs a mix
@normyzee @njc829103 wouldn't of all been his. Would Parra fans care about off field if you had a successful 5years or so on field
@sharkydave44 he's the most frustrating player. So good but only shows it 20% of the time
@sweetandsoward looks like it. Made my trip up so much better :)
@sharkydave44 so like rounds 1-8 then?
@thenrlfixer @normyzee have to keep the stars happy afterall
@thecraigbrown @sandylanceley @therealsteavis when we have stand alone SOO &amp; PI tests the same wkd. we'd have them missing for a state game
@thenrlfixer @normyzee after winning comps at Manly. Foran would want only turmoil make him feel at home
@njc829103 @normyzee they were good under him. Until they are again he will keep popping up
@thecraigbrown @sandylanceley @therealsteavis yep. The are either from Aust &amp; change or are Samoan not half &amp; half
@rl_ratings @joannalester @westsydneysport spot on. We need these nations improving. Making it easier to poach their players won't do it
@aussieblackwell yep. Young spine at Broncos means he won't start there any time soon
@aussieblackwell makes sense for both parties
@therealsteavis or they stay with that minnow &amp; can build up a quality squad rather then a team of Big 3 dis cards
@therealsteavis @sandylanceley Tonga playing only 79 tests since 1986 has hindered progress more then Jennings playing for his birth country
@sandylanceley. Here you go. Ruin SOO to keep terrible eligibilty laws in place haha
@therealsteavis how dare Australians want to play for Australia. Most mentioned are heritage players for these islands
@therealsteavis aside from Uate we are speaking Aust raised players of course Aust will be 1st choice
@sandylanceley of course you will. A glorified All Stars game
@therealsteavis do you honestly think someone from a minnow plays well in SOO they won't switch to Aust? Need to stop switch more
@sandylanceley yep. NSW V QLD always. Make something else for the rest
@normyzee That's unfair on those AFL players. Maybe u10 netballers?
@sandylanceley @shunter86 yep. Atleast at Penrith it has the academy the govt gave some funding for
@sandylanceley @shunter86 Surely they will move Parra Leagues and build a bus/parking station there to cover the extra ppl
@sandylanceley @shunter86 yep. Near the new airport is best. Yep. WS fans don't go to Parra for away games now...that won't change
@jackdorrigo1917 @shunter86 17k at Parra has transport issues. Double that with no way to expand roads &amp; will be a nightmare
@jackdorrigo1917 @shunter86 ANZ has no before or after game life. make it rectangle &amp; viewing improves
@shunter86 the moment it was to be announced post election was always on the cards. Poor choice at Parra
@gus10gould given our injuries. I can't see us winning. Has to be Broncos up there
@andy_seags @suthodan I think if there was a chance it went with that 'backflip' tumour a few weeks ago
@andy_seags @suthodan haha. I think DCE is as good as gone. Our halves playing this week are off contract &amp; wont be re-signed
@bostonnnnnn yep. Same here. I work trying to help plenty that are on the stuff though
@uncyd his rich...that gets chicks instantly wet. The rest doesn't matter
@amarief10 less then Fergo &amp; Lui did
@amarief10 just realising that now are you?
@amarief10 @blackcaps I am sure they will. Everyone loves smashing the poms
@mybsidelife @cp1074pirotta @terencebright @theriffmarn I don't think the numbers will be how they run out. Simmons may even drop back yet
@misshunter10 if you use the word Casino loose. Some pubs have bigger gaming rooms
@sharkydave44 you know GI is a protected species
@theriffmarn you would think they will stop at some stage. Thankfully we still going well enough if good enough to do something
@theriffmarn thanks. Given Moss &amp; some top graders are due back next week. We should start to get strong side on the park
@theriffmarn still no Davis. What happened to Nathan Smith?
@sweetandsoward half time oranges now then?
@wallyfrogmore so do I. So hot
@sweetandsoward aww that's no good. I always do that the moment something is easy...total opposite happens
@sweetandsoward haha. Spear tackle it!
@nikkers4you that sucks. I did similar playing oztag without my boots
@sianstevens4 haha. The only 2 normal ppl on the bus?
@normyzee yes. I am sure RU will take him.
@sweetandsoward haha. Some how I knew you would agree
@sweetandsoward after a day remembering all those formula's &amp; stuff you need a night off
@sweetandsoward haha. Good choice
@nikkers4you sure is a muscle. There's a few there? Sleep on it funny or exercise?
@normyzee @amarief10 Yeah Dragons were lean from 66 to 77
@normyzee @amarief10 Yeah Dragons smashed everyone. I didn't mind the Bears would of rathered them live then Manly
@pattonmeister same all that royal shit bores me
@sweetandsoward yes I hate that shit. The formulas still stick in my head after all this time haha
@wallyfrogmore @andy_seags ah yes cream melons the perfect desert
@sweetandsoward is it a subject you are good at atleast?
@sweetandsoward I am sure once you see the questions it will all come flooding back to you
@andy_seags @wallyfrogmore where do I sign up. She can judge me
@sweetandsoward Of course it will. Better to do the work then get there &amp; wish you did more
@shunter86 @jackdorrigo1917 @niles1991 @thebasedchapo I remember that. He asked Tighe where his boots were. Tighe was in a cast haha
@sianstevens4 not to mention unqualified workers
@thecraigbrown @normyzee @sandylanceley @thespray1 anyway Bellamy isn't coaching after next year. He gets 1 test with 2 hats on
@thecraigbrown @normyzee @sandylanceley @thespray1 they showed that last year.
@shunter86 yeah Seg, Whare &amp; ET would be flying up with boots. Hopefully they pull up well
@sweetandsoward With him or not...they will be fired up big time
@shunter86 I don't think anyone believes that
@sweetandsoward They have enough playing injured. Like us with Soward not worth the risk
@jackdorrigo1917 exactly. Right attitude is all we need
@sweetandsoward nah can't see it. He had a brace on last week still. I would say 2 weeks
@sharkydave44 him &amp; Hadley together. Make a kick in the nuts seem fun
@sharkydave44 I am going to Bris just to avoid listening to his shit in our game
@jackdorrigo1917 as long as we defend like that. I can take losing. Performances like v NQ I can't
@sharkydave44 haven't you heard Wally. Future SOO star
@jackdorrigo1917 Everyone did their role. No one really stood out. We need those sort of games until players comeback
@jackdorrigo1917 I am hoping he plays. Koroisau is a good replacement atleast
@jackdorrigo1917 not sure about him with his elbow. ET &amp; Whare would of played last game if it was a GF or something
@jackdorrigo1917 they did it with Brown last game. Taylor &amp; Whare I can see playing.
@pattonmeister @aussieblackwell At 27 I hope not.
@aussieblackwell he's hardly young. That's the disappointing thing
@aussieblackwell yep we need that garbage out of the game
@amarief10 seen better both are over rated
@suthodan @mitch_j_hooper media are dicks. The fact he tweeted it means they can read it themselves. Should be the NSW FB now
@mitch_j_hooper @aussieblackwell ignore his city v country defence broken finger behind that. He's not too bad at defence
@troydodds @bulldogritchie @telegraph_sport that's why you guys are the only paper to read.. No BS just facts
@theriffmarn yeah we can only imagine how it affected him
@jackdorrigo1917 they could do worse. I don't get the Walsh hate from Panther fans. Was limited but not hopeless
@mitch_j_hooper damn straight. 2 hours watching her fine arse
@bostonnnnnn Hadley's too high. Hawkesbury community radio announcer &gt; Hadley
@mitch_j_hooper desk drawer is too good. Your black pen has more creativity
@amarief10 you spelt Kurt Cobain wrong
@andy_seags @oneeyedtiger_ @pattonmeister haha.It worked normal at Fooeys so thought they fixed it..seems not
@pattonmeister @andy_seags @oneeyedtiger_ I have met Cassidy but she hasn't met Glen so can't even confirm
@andy_seags @oneeyedtiger_ @pattonmeister haha. Yes I was meant to meet a hot chick also damn 3G playing up
@sweetandsoward lets see how lucky after the game haha. As long we defend like last week we are a chance
@andy_seags @oneeyedtiger_ @pattonmeister @sportsfanslife I am too dumb to even run this. Let alone an Alias
@sweetandsoward I am having mine on Friday when I go too Brisbane for the footy
@sweetandsoward tell me about it. Made a fun walk to the station though haha
@andy_seags @oneeyedtiger_ @pattonmeister I believe you are ready.... Not that you aren't a cunt though
@amarief10 yeah probably not the best to watch it then.
@normyzee yeah it's garbage the media doesn't give us the full story with things
@amarief10 depends how much blood it is
@normyzee of course but that doesn't get viewers. It was always going to be twisted around
@pattonmeister @oneeyedtiger_ broken finger from City v Country. Can play with it if the pain isn't too much
@pattonmeister I am hoping we get some troops back so it's a close game. NYC is 1 v 2 so that's something atleast.
@sweetandsoward haha. love bludge days
@pattonmeister I go to Bris for the weekend on Friday. footy is the only thing planned
@pattonmeister @oneeyedtiger_ Great Dugan, Moylan injured. The next few have been injured this year...expect Daley to ring
@sweetandsoward ah great. Day off bonus
@pattonmeister @abcgrandstand @oneeyedtiger_ at the rates our FB's are falling down. I would stick by your phone.
@sweetandsoward that's great to hear. Ready for your exams today
@normyzee yeah Top Gear's name is worthless by itself
@notbreerose As a chick you are allowed to forget metallica songs
@normyzee yeah every Steph I have met has been Stephanie
@amarief10 isn't that every year? Always mid table but never high enough for anything decent
@notbreerose how can you forget the best song ever?
@shunter86 @stormchaser__23 With Dugan being out he needs to play to get SOO spot. He's fullback so won't need much defence
@sharkydave44 Pepsi is awesome far better then Coke
@sweetandsoward very early. Hope you sleep well
@gus10gould I assume Moylan needs to play atleast 1 of the next 2 games to even be a chance?
@shunter86 @sweetandsoward different style but if Sowie doesn't play we can't win. DWZ running FB not ball playing
@sandylanceley @mtweet80 @stuartayresmp yep. Never full now 20k extra empty seats now
@mtweet80 @sandylanceley @stuartayresmp 65k is too small if ANZ is no more though
@sandylanceley I am trying to work that out myself
@westsydneysport only idiots &amp; Victorians pay to watch AFL in NSW
@cmw12_ Haha. Joint weddings does have a great ring to it
@cmw12_ Haha. You get there next week to find out you agreed to be married off to a nephew or something
@cmw12_ haha. I am sure they get that all the time. The job is relaxing people after all
@suthodan Station Close on SBS out rates RU... But yeah was a good result
@njc829103 @normyzee @rl_ratings just shows the quality of the sport over rules the BS in the media
@normyzee @rl_ratings don't think it will on a Sunday. Given other sports &amp; activities that was on. 200k is my guess
@sianstevens4 Sadly for you. he watched AFL on the weekend.... He would of marked himself never go to Aust again
@sianstevens4 I have wondered why the hell maccas sells poridge... For ppl &amp; 4:30pm cravings
@normyzee @rl_ratings yep a shit timeslot too. Will be 1.1m I'd guess
@sianstevens4 yet no invite to the wedding :( . I had my lamb cutlet bib waiting
@rl_ratings @normyzee I reckon 200k for the regionals.. Shame no one cares for test RL
@sianstevens4 wow chatting to us commoners great too see
@amarief10 hopefully changes are made &amp; gets us the trophy back next year...sadly I can't see it
@sianstevens4 haha. You would be Princess Sian the 1st?
@sweetandsoward You have earnt it. Sucks there's no footy to help with that
@sharkydave44 the whole pack was soft
@dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 haha. Good planning Great Holiday &amp; no footy missed
@dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 when do you go? You will have so much fun
@sweetandsoward that's not too bad. Could be worse
@sweetandsoward do they keep you waiting long for the results?
@sweetandsoward everyone says that. I am sure you nailed it
@jasonhurst71 @the_red_heifer that wouldn't even count regionals. So add another 200k to that. Huge figures
@mitch_j_hooper yes some players just have no idea. he &amp; Gallen are 2 of them
@mitch_j_hooper I don't think anyone can. Should miss about 6 weeks combined.
@troydodds @penrithpanthers there goes the one player we can't do without
@sweetandsoward I have no doubt you will try your best. That's all you can really do :D
@sweetandsoward go smash those exams
@sweetandsoward haha. You'd probably keep tripping over in it. surely you can't walk properly
@sweetandsoward that's not too bad. On my train this chick has an ankle length school skirt. That looks strange
@normyzee yeah there's been a few of these lately.... All very sad
@normyzee Yep they are terrible... Bring on the ashes
@sweetandsoward I am sure it doesn't look that bad. Anyway everyone else is in the same boat
@sweetandsoward haha. I am sure you are
@sweetandsoward I look forward to hearing how you went
@sweetandsoward I was the same. Just terrible. To watch it live would if been the worst
@sweetandsoward Good luck with it anyway... I am sure you will go well
@sweetandsoward there's been so much of these stories lately...doesn't get any less sadder
@sweetandsoward Yeah that's right. the rest will flow from that
@sweetandsoward You will be right :) hard part is sorted
@sweetandsoward Yeah true. If you picture in your mind the start before hand... Should all flow
@thecraigbrown @normyzee @thebushnews exactly. I'd expect the same in similar situations
@sweetandsoward great that helps get it done quicker
@thecraigbrown @normyzee @thebushnews @thenrlfixer yep. The NRL doesn't need Buzz &amp; he can't stand that
@amarief10 @normyzee haha. I got out of that easy
@normyzee @amarief10 dude age had plenty to do with. They were better because they are on the way not way down
@mrives76 yep. Given his record that should be the minimum
@normyzee @amarief10 haha. I missed it but dude look at their team compared to ours. We were always going to lose
@thenrlfixer @normyzee @thebushnews @thecraigbrown media wants it to go for less. They want Smith &amp; co out
@suthodan even poor men don't deserve that shit
@amarief10 I am surprised they didn't cut the end off for their precious news...fuckers
@njc829103 @amberke52994874 @chookz1801 @normyzee @thecraigbrown Weidler for sure. Private convos shouldn't end up in print
@amarief10 haha. You are joking it's ch9 that show the rep games... No chance
@sianstevens4 @sundaynighton7 how don't they now. Is just crazy
@amarief10 sure was. Floyd knew he had it won so just stayed upright
@normyzee I have missed what the hell it's doing in a sport column or even who cares what Khoder thinks
@normyzee haha. That's not even news worthy most of Aust hate Abbott
@normyzee @njc829103 why would it sell 40k in 3 weeks if it hasn't in 3 months. 70k is a good result considering
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn need to sort a few things out for that too happen. Player eligibilty for starters
@njc829103 @normyzee Reportedly only 30k has been sold. Given the events around that time. Can't see it selling out
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn no doubt but why did we go back after the stand alone in 2001? That's my concern
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn yep. We need RL soaking the media SOO gives you that for 6 weeks. having tried it &amp; failed best leave it
@sianstevens4 ah another week of media banging on about useless shit
@sandylanceley @mj_lynch @myteamstorm they had $800m setup last time. To onsell games to Fox. Go with Fox this time
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn SOO gets pretty much 2 weeks PR on a Wed. If you move that you lose that. Tough call
@sandylanceley @mj_lynch @myteamstorm getting AFL or NRL is all that can save them. win 5 nights a week for 30 weeks
@njc829103 @normyzee @thehutch81 the 1 when everyone ran on after? Didn't they cater for 10k but had more hence the poor security
@thehutch81 @normyzee no doubt. Regular games &amp; players getting match payments 1st
@notbreerose no but quite a few exs have :(
@gc_anthony @mitchelldarts @njc829103 show's they aren't true RL fans
@theriffmarn we were never going to get off injury free. Shame though
@normyzee Samoa v Tonga at Penrith the 1st year got 16k. Should be played in WS where there's more islanders
@normyzee that was always a poor choice up there. That's an argument for another day
@sweetandsoward in that case RIP old iphone...
@normyzee they always are. Show how the game should be played
@sweetandsoward Isn't it only a few days old?
@sweetandsoward atleast it's a shit day outside
@ccleary_ Aus, Fiji, Samoa &amp; City
@pattonmeister not make this sound bad. Was he foreign? Without fail everytime someone does similar to me. Always have an accent
@wwos9 @sweetandsoward the game won't be on.... Damn rain
@uncyd 1985 or there abouts
@rl_ratings yeah you would think so. Can't play in this
@9newssyd @danny_weidler @sianstevens4 Pizza, booze but no footy it seems...
@normyzee @12thmanhq Yes time for another cd
@sianstevens4 haha. I need something like that for on the train... Keep the weirdos away
@sweetandsoward yes it is. Contact session is the one he needs. More importantly Whare's certainly back
@jackdorrigo1917 @mitch_j_hooper @suthodan yep. 1 and the same
@mitch_j_hooper @suthodan The dude tweets under the mole... Still needs a 'hidden' indentity
@kaitlynweldon haha. Friyay
@mitch_j_hooper @suthodan dude Lurker us the mole
Good pickup @panthers.
@sianstevens4 he's missing the best part of being old. Pants up to your nipples
@sweetandsoward damn why did I sell my shares in Revlon &amp; Kleenex so soon :(
@the_red_heifer ch9....that's all you need to say
@sianstevens4 end of life crisis? Or just a knob?
@sweetandsoward ah good. better get mascara too no doubt that will run aswell
@sweetandsoward it's ok. Kleenex's are on special this week for times like these
@sweetandsoward a party but crying inside
@pattonmeister yeah terrorist
@sweetandsoward ah that's good. You won't be crying too much for missing school
@sweetandsoward oh no. However will you cope not having to go to school? You poor thing
@pattonmeister yes them INXS &amp; AC/DC are prob the truly Aust bands
@pattonmeister You saved yourself from being called a terrorist
@sianstevens4 would you call what they give you on flights as coffee?
@sweetandsoward is great. Is great. Is great
@sweetandsoward good to see Mother Nature put on a lovely day for this special day
@normyzee @chrisbarrett_ @ninjajpb @smh @smhsport Breaking News &amp; Exclusive is used for every story these days
@sweetandsoward haha. Happy May the 1st back to you
@normyzee @chrisbarrett_ @ninjajpb @smh @smhsport atleast it's not bullshit like DT dishes out
@nikkers4you I wish I was one of those people that could do that
@sweetandsoward I guess a few of you lot aren't too bad
@andy_seags @uncyd until you sign halves more of that crap will go on
@cmw12_ @ausnexttopmodel you should go on it next series.
@sweetandsoward I am sure I have hair to watch or something that day
@sweetandsoward I am so jealous. Damn I missed out :(
@wallyfrogmore surely they will come here aswell?
@sweetandsoward sounds so exciting
@sharkydave44 I wouldn't laugh. He might end at Sharks yet haha
@ninjajpb @indians @kansas haha. Get in and help
@wallyfrogmore Henry went aswell. You watch Benji or Widdop go down now
@aussieblackwell yep. No doubt
@nikkers4you haha. We all have them
@sweetandsoward still days off are always good
@sweetandsoward probably better this way.... Not as fun though
@nikkers4you ahh you are 1 of those people...
@sweetandsoward &amp; you didn't even need to knock over any trees to get it off either
@armchairride @benfordham @normyzee you have it wrong. They were selling bibles....atleast that's what they want us to believe
@sweetandsoward that will keep us both happy
@normyzee @andycee007 @benfordham in that bubble maybe but the majority doesn't have those views
@andycee007 @benfordham @normyzee yep. Murder is unlawful killing this wasn't. Don't have to agree but wasn't murder
@sweetandsoward well I have work so hopefully it rains in the city
@normyzee @benfordham the stupid thing is a search of twitter or facebook gives them an idea of the publics thoughts
@normyzee @benfordham yep. Each day they prove how far out of touch they are with the public
@sweetandsoward it's sunny here now so hopefully it clears up :-)
@sweetandsoward haha. Yes yesterday was a great day
@sincerelytumblr @sweetandsoward that bitch. How mean
@andy_seags @jackdorrigo1917 that doesn't sell papers though
@bantheabc @andy_seags @sianstevens4 @wallyfrogmore you forgot the toilet smelling Nile
@jackdorrigo1917 @andy_seags Violence fullstop is an issue not just man on woman.
@andy_seags @bantheabc @sianstevens4 @wallyfrogmore I boycott most of them because they are holes not because of some hashtag
@suthodan haha. Poor nerds will think they are good now.
@sweetandsoward haha. he needs more injured time to get better at Fifa
@ccleary_ @natetaylor87 thanks. Oztag night means I can't watch the news
@bluey18713 @suthodan exactly. I never get PPV too risky it will be over in a punch
@natetaylor87 how come he always wore a Souths hat then? Weird
@suthodan you would be the only one not excited for it
@mitch_j_hooper @sandylanceley haha. yes a thing seen less then the loch ness monster
@sandylanceley violence against men doesn't make good headlines
@armchairride @buzzrothfield @foxnrl the crayons are struggling for stories clearly
@sianstevens4 now now you can't talk sense to idiots
@sweetandsoward sadly doesn't make me kick or pass like him
@sweetandsoward damn everything happens on oztag nights. I will play in headgear as a tribute haha
@leaguefreak I am signing up as we speak
@mitch_j_hooper @andrewvossy sadly it won't happen. That would mean pushing SOO earlier
@nikkers4you I will take that over the guy next to me playing dance music loud...headphones FFS
@wallyfrogmore damn right or aussie &amp; hating vegemite...terrorists the lot of them
@normyzee @kangaroos @rl_ratings @tiger_cmail yep RU is 4th in our sports now. Gone are the days when they were an event
@amarief10 haha. So tomorrow back to your old phone?
@normyzee @the_red_heifer unblock some A League nutters
@sharkydave44 it rains the week before the game. Our crowd halves regardless of the weather on the day
@sianstevens4 ahh good can't be me....the prawn is more smarter then me
@sharkydave44 hopefully yours turn up unlike ours
@telegraph_sport @sweetandsoward further proof that Penrith is best
@andy_seags @mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 maybe try a celebrity video with it?
@the_red_heifer more so Buzz can read
@njc829103 @normyzee no Nicko they were the only people to ever get the death penalty in history
@andy_seags @mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 put your bomb out might work better
@the_red_heifer yep. The prick dived twice in that game alone
@wallyfrogmore Now watch you get smashed by the bleeding hearts
@notbreerose Tinder is a myth. 90% dudes &amp; no over 50's. Fuck that!
@thenrlfixer @normyzee China &amp; US still have it. What if they demanded we use it or lose trade etc?
@sweetandsoward I used to work in a jail. Most in there wouldn't of cared for death over the conditions in jail
@thenrlfixer @normyzee we call it barbic.. They call it justice. We can't push our views on them
@sweetandsoward probably right because everyone gets locked up eventually. Rather then the few that's caught
@sianstevens4 nothing in it for the media so they don't care
@sweetandsoward yep. Seems every week some trouble is USA yet they have the death penalty
@sweetandsoward yep. Crimes don't decrease from it. Kinda pointless
@sweetandsoward yeah I am not a fan of it. Sadly these backward countries think it achieves something
@pattonmeister I understand if it's a bendy road &amp; wind but the flat M4
@sharkydave44 no tears here nor will there be
@pattonmeister how the hell does someone flip on the M4.
@sweetandsoward yes there's no winner from these situations
@dazza_20 @sweetandsoward yes. Shows want can be achieved with the right attitude
@sianstevens4 yep. We aren't talking possible crimes here. Proven criminals deserve nothing
@pattonmeister mine's the same. I drive with 1 in quite often.
@normyzee I can only find the media seeing them as victims...the rest see them as they are criminals
@sianstevens4 or better still keep out of other countries problems
@pattonmeister yes ipod fully charged to avoid the dribble
@mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 that's what gets me. That's ignored with this useless media
@sianstevens4 @mitch_j_hooper or what if the Boston bomber gets sentenced to death? No one will care then
@andy_seags @dizzy_dave23 @former_legend Yeah it's never a good situation for family but even would be worse if they got the drugs here
@andy_seags @dizzy_dave23 @former_legend while they were guilty &amp; punished accordingly...punishment seems too harsh
@mj_lynch ah yes  DT journos love to fail
@leaguefreak it's stupid they don't. Explains why they can never beat us in tests
@normyzee 10? I'd give him less then a 1% strike rate
@amps1 that &amp; we didn't get any alternative to using coal. I can't see where our next innovation is coming
@amps1 yep. Carbon tax was poor but atleast could of created more industry that could bring in some money. Need forward thinkers
@wallyfrogmore shootings that can't come soon enough for my liking. So everyone shuts up
@amps1 yep the govt doesn't seem to have a plan b for the down turn
@irishvsearth @bostonnnnnn good point. It's hard the endorsements are higher for James. I put it too more soccer players to spread around
@wallyfrogmore that's my excuse for it
@wallyfrogmore haha.
@wallyfrogmore &amp; said it was boring...always has action here
Nothing like some Limp Bizkit up loud after oztag
@sweetandsoward glad to hear
@irishvsearth @bostonnnnnn but some wouldn't like him &amp; like Ronaldo or someone else
@sweetandsoward haha. I was thinking you are the only person to downgrade haha
@sweetandsoward that your new phone?
@bostonnnnnn Lebron. Has china &amp; US for starters
@nikkers4you nice work haha.
@the_red_heifer @joshrobbo44 @pattonmeister haha nice. Tt suck all this stuff is on Oztag nights. Need more stuff on Thurs
@nikkers4you I did that yesterday. I thought they would be the same platform at Parra...nope :(
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @the_red_heifer they have 1 at the Colonial on Tues night. Give bar vouchers away score
@nikkers4you wrong train?
@oneeyedtiger_ @badel_cmail @readingtheplay @rlw_mole yep that &amp; Exclusive is used with most stories these days
@pattonmeister @rlw_mole Nope. Neither was DCE going to backflip. Slow news day it seems
@the_red_heifer I Typed in Garbage &amp; got bombarded with DT articles
@theriffmarn @normyzee yep. G.Jennings needs a big fortnight or so. Our starting backline picks itself when fit
@mitch_j_hooper @suthodan Aside from GF's I think players need to ease back via lower grades or in this case NRL
@theriffmarn @normyzee Exactly. It took injury to get him his chance but he took it. Ivan will now give him the luxury of loyalty
@uncyd Didn't they? Surely they did with all this attention
@mitch_j_hooper @suthodan he can't play off no match fitness. That's just crazy
@sharkydave44 he could prob get desperation money anyway now. Comfort &amp; Learn off DCE
@sharkydave44 Yep DCE will have the pressure &amp; he can just get settled
@wallyfrogmore twitter is for looking at boobs &amp; jokes. Anyone that uses it to get butthurt is a dick
@mitch_j_hooper @gotham it was on ch9 they can murder a show. I agree it was good
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister @stevowins @the_red_heifer that is the shit. I can stay there for hours
@sharkydave44 I think he will stay up there. Just will be sorting the details now
@sharkydave44 haha. He will stay here somewhere
@normyzee @thecraigbrown mate hears media say x players is going somewhere. I say it's 99% lies
@normyzee @thecraigbrown I have this argument with dicks all the time. See players linked places &amp; meltdown instantly
@normyzee @theriffmarn we have an international back 3. They will be picked when fit. We have bigger issues then wingers
@thecraigbrown Once again puts egg on the face of the media in this country
@normyzee @theriffmarn Ivan is a little too keen to hold guys back. So he must show plenty to stay
@normyzee @theriffmarn so DWZ is good enough to be picked for NZ but not 1st grade?
@ali_chahrour94 @theriffmarn ok. Who's better that's not playing for him to play?
@theriffmarn some ppl. Age is no barrier skill is what counts
@ali_chahrour94 @theriffmarn nope minority. He was unstoppable on the weekend. judge him when Sowie's back
@notbreerose just sights or smells too?
@mitch_j_hooper @brendancowell @the_red_heifer nor has the sentence changed. Always been death
@sharkydave44 yep. There's only so much that can be done. Looneys have no idea
@mitch_j_hooper @brendancowell @the_red_heifer good question. Also will this outrage be there when the Boston bomber get death
hey @MiakateRussell will there be the same bullshit campaign when the Boston bomber gets sentenced to death?
@sianstevens4 haha. Nah easier to blame the police
@wallyfrogmore haha. Tweet her that
@notbreerose filled the bowl or blown O ring?
@nikkers4you that's good thinking. I waiting for a few to go 1st then got the 3rd train could atleast stand
@sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown so am I. Needs to be reported to hopefully stop others but this is overkill
@nikkers4you yep. I am only at Town hall so only have a short sardine trip.
@sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown It would be interesting to see if ppl actually tune in or out with that. I don't watch news any way
@oneeyedtiger_ @bradwaltersmh @smh get them out of the game full stop
@jarroddmc @ccleary_ the Souths we are seeing has more problems then injuries. I'd see going too hard in pre-season is taking it's toll
@thecraigbrown yep. Once again the media showing how out of touch they really are with the public
@troydodds @sarrahlem yeah seems to be a regular event
@sianstevens4 Candlelight vigils for criminals crazy. All these celebrities should come to work with me &amp; see what drugs do.
@sianstevens4 or just not worry about drug dealer getting their punishment is even better
@nikkers4you haha. You should pass the hat around the carriage to pay for it for them
@theriffmarn imo only like for like charges should attract extra penalty from the lower grades
@suthodan you should raid our halves that played on the weekend. Neither will be re-signed
@vulture everyone's back for it @ninjajpb . You will get it well before us :(
@suthodan @leaguefreak we just found the next target of the soft cocks complaints
@notbreerose except if you bomb the place
@notbreerose socks with sandals, shorts pulled to your nipples.... You pull grandmas all day
@thecraigbrown @normyzee Yep no doubt about guilt... No apologies in that case
@notbreerose 2 reasons a late night with them you are home at 6pm, they think it could be their last ever so go off in the sack
@normyzee they have made a decision. The pollies are trying to bully them into changing that decision
@notbreerose I am next week. Been banned from every bingo hall, Bowling Club &amp; Retirement home in Aus :(
@notbreerose it will be my pic when I am on four corners next week
@notbreerose yep. If that's me I am getting my face blured and voice changed atleast
@notbreerose they are never um &amp; ahhing on that show no matter where they come from
@joeljpienmunne1 not unless a winger does down wont make SOO 1. Yeah Soward, Seg, Whare &amp; Taylor play next game
@notbreerose I always think it's a bit of both
@joeljpienmunne1 we have Souths before SOO &amp; 2 byes. wont have any in either.
@joeljpienmunne1 @uncyd glad it is for someone. We always lose to them haha sharks got us twice last year
@joeljpienmunne1 yeah similar to ours. Tricky but if you are good enough you will make it.
@the_red_heifer chose the serious one...good choice
@the_red_heifer yep. you will laugh at the clowns either way
@joeljpienmunne1 in a way I understand. Have lost a few to lower placed teams. How's your next month or so? Ours is tricky
@joeljpienmunne1 yeah it's a strange 1 to gauge anyone's form really.
@amarief10 Benji is in charge of a side ave 13points a game... He should be no where near the side
@amarief10 Benji's rubbish. Foran's been worse then Johnson
@niles1991 @uncyd sad isn't it
@uncyd @suthodan yep. I am against the death penalty but that's the rules they have.
@misshunter10 don't break it over their head then
@suthodan @uncyd I see it as who are we to tell them how they can punish people
@amarief10 happens in all sports all the time when players leave
@amarief10 They are right booing is far worse then racism
@normyzee @rbb_net @trickyricky_12 @westsydneysport sending flare sellers to centrelink
@amarief10 probably ask you to step on a train so they can scream racist shit at you
@pattonmeister even my 4 weeks annual earlier in the year flew
@rugbyleaguespot don't remember the tackle but surely he will fight it. Poor guy has no luck trying to play for NZ
boo @triplemsydney Amercian idiot should top 10 atleast
@amarief10 yes his height makes his man boobs get over looked.
@amarief10 Idris not far behind either
@amarief10 if I was 5 years younger. Would already be in. Haha. A few players play with decent size boobs now. man bun your hair
@sianstevens4 haha. Music to my ears
@sianstevens4 I don't pay attention to the ad...just her. She's hot
@amarief10 that's ok. A few NRL players made a decent career of it. I might sign up for shits &amp; giggles
@sianstevens4 haha. could have so many meanings
@notbreerose yes boss
@armchairride @buzzrothfield &amp; had his laptop with him. Probably waiting to give Gus a love letter
@sweetandsoward haha. That will sort them out more then a slap
@sweetandsoward great now to get the word out. Today's the day to be a smartarse to you
@sweetandsoward oh no. How ever will you slap people now...
@normyzee A man of Buzz' morals... Of course he wouldn't write something that wasn't true
@notbreerose damn right GILF are the only way to go
@normyzee @dailytelegraph well Buzz knows his AFL so who are we too argue
@sweetandsoward NSW Cup will certainly win it again. The way they played on Sat with all the players out was great.
@mattraiders09 @grillteam WT were 3rd this time last year. Parra were also top 4 after 10 came 9th
@sweetandsoward now to keep them all there
@mattraiders09 @grillteam yep. When the other teams fire up they will get left behind. Wet weather suits their lack of attack
@sweetandsoward Panthers are in 8 in all 3 grades....will be a great day
@sharkydave44 @penrithpanthers it's the defensive effort I have been waiting for. Mon just took too much out of you guys
@amarief10 I never do. Better me staying up in that case
@amarief10 will you wake back up again?
@normyzee @njc829103 that &amp; Souths are our 2 that we should really almost sell out
@pattonmeister @jackdorrigo1917 @wallyfrogmore you get 4 of them followed by 4 shockers even in lower grades but is still very young
@jackdorrigo1917 @pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore can go MIA but we have props in NSW Cup/NYC
@normyzee @njc829103 you guys get more at our clash at Penrith. Then at Parra
@sharkydave44 1 in NSW Cup. 1 in NYC &amp; 1 in SG Ball.
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore our props are soft. Lower grades have size. Rather keep Brown &amp; them then Merrin
@wallyfrogmore @pattonmeister I will pass that hat around to keep him there
@sharkydave44 we have them. Just need to get old enough we don't need to buy anyone
@normyzee @njc829103 nope. If it rains the month before the game our fans don't show
@sweetandsoward when the sun came out at the footy. I sneezed like 10 times
@sharkydave44 the shit thing is. We have a forward pack of huge guys in both lower grade sides...waste
@sharkydave44 good luck with that. I wish he did backflip
@sweetandsoward sneezing is the worse
@sharkydave44 haha. Just dangling the line in
@amarief10 will lose
@scottymcrae @theriffmarn thought that was the case. Wasn't sure how late the change was for fine POV
@joshrobbo44 @pattonmeister @suthodan fact is both were 50/50. Both should of gone to VR
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @suthodan you are comparing an issue that had 12 looks compared to 1 with none.
@joshrobbo44 @pattonmeister @suthodan @vossy7 sharks guy was pulling the arm. That should be play on
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @suthodan would you rather he lays flat out across or legs like that. Ennis could of gone anywhere he wanted
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @suthodan if Ennis goes left or passes it. Do you think play is stopped for a penalty?
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @suthodan are you saying that's the only time a player laid in the ruck without moving?
@joshrobbo44 @pattonmeister @suthodan RCG didn't move. He can't vanish those cases should be play on
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @suthodan @vossy7 it's another grey area that needs to be cleaned up though.
@dannitequila yeah it was a great win
@normyzee @njc829103 yes doubled in 20mins
@normyzee @njc829103 WT &amp; Bulldogs as well.
@njc829103 crowd came in late
@penrithpanthers fans. Injuries are just an excuse for poor performances. We won all 3 grades
@theriffmarn @scottymcrae did the same last home game with Yeo
@njc829103 another poor turnout from our mythical members
Soward's replacement when he hangs up the headgear. Is on fire in NYC.... Keep it going Tyrone
@bostonnnnnn @sowwowofficial If a player is a prick to you. Go for it but because you hate them onfield poor form
@normyzee @njc829103 @tenash921 @thecraigbrown the days of 20k at Newy are a couple of seasons off
Even in NYC do you get terrible VR calls. nothing to overturn that
@penrithpanthers @sweetandsoward been a great game so far lets keep it going
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @tenash921 AFL had plenty of games. It's the 3rd yr of ch9 showing it will take time
@bostonnnnnn has to be more then bad luck. We still have a team that can win if the attitude's right
@bostonnnnnn @sowwowofficial yeah he's a great guy. Don't know why he gets so much shit
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers yeah it's a great day here too no rain
@thecraigbrown @rl_ratings Archer has messed the VR up big time. Wont always get involved either
@normyzee especially when the 'journo' needs rehab himself
@njc829103 @buzzrothfield Brett Finch
lol @buzzrothfield doing a story on someone going into rehab. Why don't you try it yourself grub
@sianstevens4 damn right!
@amarief10 haha. Say how you really feel
@mtweet80 @manukaoval @njc829103 there's still time. Ricky is coach afterall
@ccleary_ @emmg86 nope. There's a reason Will Smith didn't play today &amp; it's not to hand out the tackle bags tomorrow
@ccleary_ @emmg86 he's not. I was at NSW Cup &amp; spoke to some ppl &amp; know the team
@theriffmarn I said it last week. Good teams win regardless of what roadblocks they get. A very weak team on paper today.
@thecraigbrown yep. He leave a huge hole next year
@normyzee @njc829103 was crazy. We won with so many players out... Further proof injuries are an excuse
Sam Scarlett &gt; Matt Cornish
A League whimps. Panthers v Mounties is be played in hail
@theriffmarn this will test the team to get this win
@jackdorrigo1917 @theriffmarn much better then moving others around
@amarief10 yes. Was a shocking 2nd half
@sweetandsoward same :(
@readingtheplay yep. Too much skill to be this bad. Some teams have a poor culture in grained
@oneeyedtiger_ @nyrangers 12 more wins to go!
@oneeyedtiger_ yes bring it.
@notbreerose I broke my michaelango's skateboard
@nat_sinclair93 @tennewssydney @theriffmarn didn't see the ch10 but ch7 showed video of you girls
@theriffmarn @nat_sinclair93 @tennewssydney ch7 had the same footage. Kinda takes the focus off the story
@wallyfrogmore @uncyd I have had a few random artist follow me. Must be an app they use
@normyzee @juanfarkall behind the posts? anything outside of the goalposts you can't see. You can watch the screen at home
@juanfarkall @normyzee Homebush is shit. Too far from the action. You put with it for SOO &amp; that but not club games
@pattonmeister @sharkydave44 he should be off the bench. Reynolds starting hooker. Mybe 5/8th
@sweetandsoward yes me too. Go us
@sharkydave44 he's playing 80mins when his a 40min player. That's why
@pattonmeister Austin signed for 2 years. They released him to go down there
@pattonmeister they made the choice &amp; let Austin go. Poor mistake
@suthodan neutral doc &amp; counts as a change unless you comeback on
@suthodan wait til the changes goes down again. Needs a neutral doc
@pattonmeister Austin is so much better then him
@thecraigbrown that's my issue with the VR. He chooses when to come in or not
@normyzee nope. They won't have 60% of the ball all game. Will win comfortably
@sweetandsoward it sucks
@mitch_j_hooper the worst they have played ever
@thecraigbrown nope you see that in 90% of tackles
@suthodan nope. The sooner neutral doctors come in the better
@sweetandsoward they always stuff my tips up. I pick them they lose. Don't pick them. They win
@sweetandsoward sad thing is it's the 2nd best move of that half
@readingtheplay @sharkydave44 Taylor &amp; Brown playing makes us a 2 try better defensive team. That would bring the price in
@sharkydave44 @sowwowofficial I reckon Brown, Seg &amp; Taylor will play. Atleast will give us our defence back.
@sharkydave44 @sowwowofficial I can't see him playing with next week as a bye. Also we need defence sorted aswell as him
@sweetandsoward A few were hard. NQ &amp; us never win against the teams we play so was pretty easy
@sweetandsoward I went all the home teams. Except Panthers
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @sosaysrenee I'd think that's just normal day in Penrith
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @sosaysrenee the dude at the servo near Doms said it was a 1 hr cop chase
@notbreerose if you start that on here... I best block myself
@pattonmeister @joshrobbo44 @sosaysrenee i just tried to go that before knowing. A few cop cars
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ Nokia's are the best. Just not as old as mine
@ccleary_ since we can never beat the Sharks &amp; have a NSW Cup team playing. I have a tipping comp to win need to tip with my head
@bostonnnnnn everyone should have that cock Rothfield in their top 1
@ccleary_ I went all home teams except for us
@amarief10 it would probably longer then it would take to come out of your body
@notbreerose Or inserting your arse into another while at musical theatre whilist in pink
@bostonnnnnn any DT journo. Too soft always block
@Notbreerose Shit now you tell me
@pattonmeister @WallyFrogmore so did I. I have no issue reporting negative facts but that crap's not on
@pattonmeister @WallyFrogmore I called @BuzzRothfield a cockhead and got blocked. Buzz you still are!!
@normyzee @armchairride @NRL It's a home game so not only will we be called Oak Panthers non stop. The signage will remain also
@WallyFrogmore @pattonmeister They can't handle anything like that
@pattonmeister @WallyFrogmore yeah the only 1 I have abused is Buzz
@normyzee @armchairride @NRL Parra's playing away so no chance the sponsor would stand for that
@BoozeRothfield haha. Who cares RSL is better and has cheaper drinks..
@pattonmeister @WallyFrogmore All those News limited hacks are whimps with the slighest criticism then claim to talk for the people
@mitch_j_hooper haha. So true
@sianstevens4 @wallyfrogmore it's like they are trying to see who can annoy you the most
@wallyfrogmore @sianstevens4 never been as annoying though haha
@sweetandsoward yep. Get the pizza delivered &amp; won't move from the lounge
@sweetandsoward although 5 games on tomorrow is excellent
@sianstevens4 yep. I have only ever heard them shortened to shitbox
@sianstevens4 of course you are. You wouldn't stalk.... Oops I mean who would stalk ;-)
@pattonmeister nope. SOO coming up anyway.
@GrillTeam The dress restrictions @ Panthers will just make ppl go to the RSL. Security can just kick out the idiot perves
@sianstevens4 haha. That's something you should think not say
@sianstevens4 They listened to you!
@amarief10 all seem to be good games too! Good thing is my team doesn't play so wont go &amp; can watch them all
@amarief10 yeah it's great. All day footy!
@sianstevens4 it's great to have Friday back...
@sweetandsoward yeah footy's on tonight can't get better then that
@oneeyedtiger_ I always find that when footy day is a week day
@sweetandsoward tell me about it. This week has dragged on
@pattonmeister just Dragons v Roosters
@amarief10 hopefully ours does the same
@amarief10 haha. mine's more black widow &amp; Katness together dream
@ninjajpb @brewers how's the view up there? Looks like from the top of ANZ
@amarief10 yes tell me about it nothing worse than when chicks are too skinny. She can go on the former hot chick list
@wallyfrogmore the fuckwits go crazy for some place they will never go too
@steeldawn2012 @dailytelegraph @normyzee I won't buy. So didn't work here
@normyzee @dailytelegraph @myteamstorm yep. IF KA was playing he'd be the opposite just anti Smith
@normyzee @njc829103 Buzz only writes something that suits him.
@normyzee @dailytelegraph the scum has no right being backpage like he is
@normyzee @nrlfootyshow That's why I don't watch it...always garbage like that
@wallyfrogmore Buzz rothfield loves UFC &amp; beer...count him in
@normyzee like farts...never get old
@jackdorrigo1917 @buzzrothfield @the_red_heifer I stopped buying years ago. Won't even read a free copy at Maccas until he's gone
@the_red_heifer @buzzrothfield @whiteribbonaust yes he's a scumbag. Even less reason to buy the DT now
@jackdorrigo1917 Buzz doesn't care he just wants the story.
@suthodan yes he really is a scum bag
@BuzzRothfield you are a grub. Puff pieces on wife beaters has no place in the media
@amarief10 yeah sure is. Needs more black widow though
Inbetweeners....funniest show ever! Haha
@amarief10 Is the best movie ever...
@sweetandsoward haha. Well it looks cool anyway
@sweetandsoward Do you just make you on it?
@sharkydave44 he's had the injury since round 4 &amp; playing. Nothing confirmed. Sat's NSW Cup will tell us more
@sweetandsoward haha. You so should use that in the Sims
@sharkydave44 if Seg plays we are a chance to get it wide.
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @sianstevens4 my rule is needs to have a hot chick for me to see it....
@sharkydave44 nope. There goes any chance we had of winning
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @sianstevens4 haha. I wish I could say that was the coolest movie I have seen to attempt to score
@sianstevens4 didn't watch it. The 1st 3 was enough. Should of stopped there
Avengers time!
@pattonmeister we do close backups with Gc &amp; Manly...yet don't whinge
@aussieblackwell 1st period we were behind in shots 9-2
@amarief10 bloggers are just idiots trying to be relevant
@aussieblackwell was a great game. They were all over us. Did well to get the result
@pattonmeister @oneeyedtiger_  A depleted Bulldogs &amp; Canberra ran down big leads. Hardly front runners
@notbreerose nope Grandma only cares about getting fucked hard
@notbreerose if that's not dead then who knows what is
@amarief10 well the pricks finally picked Stokes and Buttler I noticed. So maybe...nah it's England
@amarief10 so you like 1 sided games?
@normyzee yep. Better things to do then rescue dickheads
@pattonmeister it's wrong still to make an excuse. Just not like she ate her demons away or anything
@pattonmeister she's hot. Not like she needed to do that for attention
@pattonmeister You know from experience do you?
@pattonmeister @mitch_j_hooper @twileague it's used in Ice Hockey &amp; works well. Might make teams go for it more in ET
@nikkers4you does hair looking like shite on a hot person. Still look any worse then normal hair on ugly ppl
@sweetandsoward there's always parking near Coles anyway. But yeah leaving can be a pain
@sweetandsoward I can walk to the game aswell if it's not raining
@notbreerose Bruce Willis gets plenty of chicks. Hugh Hefner does also.... So either is as good as the other
@keipert76 yeah. I watch it on name only &amp; waiting for some old style humour but nothing
@sweetandsoward yep. We will already struggle the last thing we need is a wet game
@sweetandsoward yeah nothing worse then a wet weekend
@natetaylor87 @jackdorrigo1917 he hasn't been his best lately. So better off getting looked at so he's back to his best
@sweetandsoward hopefully it stays for the next few days
@sweetandsoward So much better to wake up to this instead
@theriffmarn @matthewjhorne most seem due around then. Sadly our season could be over at the same stage
@theriffmarn if our attitude is right we will still win. Defence is the key
@sweetandsoward house flooded... No school
@amarief10 so am I. At 330
@theriffmarn he has been playing injured. Can do with the rest
@amarief10 never seen either
@petervlang @armchairride either way it's just for a week. We fix our defence this wk. Sowie slots in next game
@amarief10 If you need to have bad hair atleast it's a rock god hair
@petervlang @armchairride I see Smith as centre or FB.Scarlett is a true half &amp; Soward's back next game so it's just for a game
@fitmoments @armchairride @bigpolarbearr @petervlang Brown's needed to fix up the pack
@petervlang @armchairride @bigpolarbearr I hope for Scarlett over Smith
@sharkydave44 he will be hooker.
Segeyaro out for 4 weeks. Don't hold back Ivan send in Scarlett
@bostonnnnnn Freddie had a crack didn't he?
@armchairride @bigpolarbearr @petervlang we will score 3 tries. Problem is we can't hold teams to under that
@bigpolarbearr @petervlang any team with both halves out struggles as Souths are proving. We ave 50 MT per game just not good enough
@petervlang @bigpolarbearr our props &amp; poor defence is worse then having no Soward in attack
@andycee007 @latemailtips I follow the Knicks. They are far worse then Manly
@troydodds @leaguefreak AFL has no signing during the season yet always have speculation over players
@keipert76 @petervlang Ivan doesn't drop players but yep him &amp; McKendry most likely
@notbreerose nothing to do with the floods. have you seen the hot chick that's in the ads? Fuck Coles forever now!
@troydodds @leaguefreak speculation was behind DCE rumours. Not sure if this will fix it
@petervlang @penrithpanthers yep. More hoping there's changes even without ET &amp; Brown
@troydodds @leaguefreak did they sign contracts or just agree to terms? players will still backflip just will be under the table
@aussieblackwell @incognateo @mattymcp25 @mdoyle08 @mitchelldarts @niles1991 @sharkydave44 @wallyfrogmore anyone that won't is gay
@sweetandsoward I am torn. I want the sun but then I have no excuse to miss work tomorrow...
@sweetandsoward I was scared at 1st. This strange blue thing in the sky
@sweetandsoward I have forgetten what it looks like
@amarief10 @normyzee a bus going to Warriors games has more people in it then they get to games
@ninjajpb @chicagobulls @nhlblackhawks Yeah must be. Before I went to @msg I used to think they had 2 courts haha
@amarief10 @normyzee we have 18teams you guys can have
@normyzee @amarief10 Move over ANZAC test. Nothing brings the 2 together more than AFL
@suthodan @leaguefreak did they actually sign though? I have agreed to a few jobs but didn't show up or went elsewhere
@leaguefreak Lewis, Papalli &amp; Tedisco are the only I can think of
@ninjajpb @chicagobulls @nhlblackhawks It's crazy how quick they can get that done over there
@the_red_heifer @njc829103 @normyzee yep. mention it any other time during the year
@normyzee @the_red_heifer no side hasn't said some stupid things about this stuff. That means bugger all in times like this
@the_red_heifer @normyzee yep. Disgraceful. I have blocked a few mentioning the de-sal plant wasted etc. Grubs
@sweetandsoward wait til you get what we are now :(
@notbreerose oh it's cold day there aswell...good to know
@sianstevens4 does thinking it count?
@guywhotweetsyou @mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 comes down to $ &amp; votes. Bigger not worse area gets priority
@sianstevens4 @mitch_j_hooper that's govt thinking for you
@guywhotweetsyou @mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 both. Media gets 4.5m interested instead of 200k.
@mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 I'd happily stay home for a week if they want to fix their 1st. Stuff my roads that
@sweetandsoward You know you have good friends. When they will vandalise stuff to help you.... Oh &amp; them!
@mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 yeah. I get that. Keep things moving &amp; that. Wouldn't make Dungong and areas feel better though
@normyzee I have heard knobs say things about the desal plant and that. Politics should be left out of times like this
@sweetandsoward yep the map looks worse then yesterday was. Should rain til atleast 4
@sweetandsoward ah good. Any other response would mean you'd have to disown her
@sianstevens4 @normyzee to be fair Sydney does have to biggest population...though a bit of water on the road is nothing
@sweetandsoward great. I imagine it will take them about 1.1 secs to agree to it.
@sweetandsoward should only take 2 of you. Lean back on the tree &amp; snap. Tree everywhere. Everyone home
@chickoonaroll same. Woke up heard my roof almost blowing off &amp; went stuff that. After I can ring work at 8... I am so sleeping
@sweetandsoward haha. That's the attitude
@chickoonaroll nice work. An in bed day for you too!
@sweetandsoward A good enough reason to miss it
@sweetandsoward if it's as bad there as it is here. I am surprised any trees are still left standing
@sweetandsoward as long as no one gets hurt. I will wish that for you!
@sianstevens4 so true. This what I was expecting last month for Cyclone Nathan. That was a light shower compared to this
@sianstevens4 I was thinking surely it can't rain anymore.... That got proven wrong
@sweetandsoward It's good that you are braving it for school. Hopefully a road will be closed &amp; you can go home or something
@nikkers4you cop that storm
@sweetandsoward you poor thing. I had a stay in bed day
@cmw12_ that's fracking crazy
@sianstevens4 @sandotraffic yes I don't envy that job on days like today
@sweetandsoward yeah it's crazy
@mj_lynch @skynewsaust news limited loves him. Won't let facts get in their way
@sharkydave44 @wallyfrogmore Twitter blocks those images on mine now...the pricks
@wallyfrogmore @mitchelldarts it's a great show. We need more sport related dramas
@pattonmeister yep. Since the bail laws have been relaxed. Bikies are taking over
@wallyfrogmore everyone having a blackout doesn't help
@sianstevens4. Must be to send junk mail to ppl. I'd like Mr twitter to delete DM convos when I have blocked someone
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 like us. They will make up ground with limited SOO players
@dizzy_dave23 @leaguefreak RU would love to get disgruntled RL players
@dizzy_dave23 @leaguefreak bigger then that. Clubs lose the need to develop quality drops away
@mtweet80 @njc829103 @thecraigbrown yep. Our Grandkids can tell us if it was us or not
@mtweet80 @njc829103 @thecraigbrown Dinosaurs had climate change. Whether we could of done anything to slow it is the doubt
@mtweet80 @njc829103 @thecraigbrown sadly we won't ever see who's right in this
@amarief10 your Thurs night is our Thurs arvo so you see it 1st! Should be a good movie
@amarief10 Iron man 3 is on tonight. It will warm me up for Thurs night
@theriffmarn if it's just an illness he might fine by game day. Him BMM, Sop need some game time to push others out
@theriffmarn I would think they would want a game before the test. It's a shame a few guys need a run in NSW Cup
@theriffmarn Dockers bad year continues.
@theriffmarn Taylor &amp; Brown still not right?
@dizzy_dave23 @leaguefreak any real good one's you can sign for like 10 yrs if you want. A draft ruins that
@normyzee yeah some ppl are so stupid
@amarief10 nothing about any of them is attractive
@jackdorrigo1917 @natetaylor87 the best decade in every way
@dizzy_dave23 @leaguefreak my team loses them all the time but we have 1st option on them. We lose that with a draft
@dizzy_dave23 @leaguefreak until he loses his juniors to Sharks or someone
@sweetandsoward atleast you are home now :)... I am not so lucky yet
@sweetandsoward that's crazy they make you still wear skirts in this weather
@amarief10 smart. He won't put a hit on you after that tweet
@normyzee @njc829103 someone should of pushed him..just enough to break his crayons
@normyzee @njc829103 then wonders why he's decibel reader picks stuff all up
@natetaylor87 @ccleary_ good to see props being tried atleast. We need another big guy in the team
@natetaylor87 @ccleary_ he's been great in NSW Cup if he did get the callup. Any props in that group
@leaguefreak only dickheads want a draft &amp; salary cap changes
@wwpenrith @chickoonaroll yeah right Ivan never drops anyone
@mitch_j_hooper of course or a NSW Cup player
@sweetandsoward last week we played oztag in the storm...home, blanket on &amp; about 20000 hot chocolates
@sweetandsoward good job. That helps me when it's cold
@thecraigbrown @normyzee Brett Finch. Sterlo. I have seen Alan Tongue on there sometimes. Should be the best ppl regardless
@normyzee @larapittfox spot on Norm. Someone like Russell Fairfax is just as hard working as is plenty of others
@sweetandsoward lots of hot chocolate &amp; you will be fine :)
@pattonmeister @sharkydave44 @wallyfrogmore Wallace &amp; Kite are terrible. It's ET, Sowie, Whare &amp; Brown we need back
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore Whare, Brown, Taylor this week. Sowie next game
@wallyfrogmore @pattonmeister @sharkydave44 we had similar last year. Defence was better &amp; coach seems to have no answers
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore we play Souths &amp; Mel twice. Never win in Bris or at Brookie
@wallyfrogmore @pattonmeister I don't think we will make the 8 due to the run home we have &amp; having no urgency in defence
@sweetandsoward put on a cough &amp; go home.
@wallyfrogmore that was to be expected. The 'experts' will be expecting the Roosters of 2013 to appear
@pattonmeister it's hard to read into to teams form so far. No one really setting the world alight. Still time though
@pattonmeister @the_journo01 Daley picks club halves. Keary/Reynolds. Pearce/Maloney &amp; Hodki/Reynolds are the options
@sianstevens4 gee I thought mine was bad. Crazy
@sweetandsoward @chrisurquhart atleast it should be a bludge day with lots of ppl not there
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward yes I can see her doing that
@ccleary_ well not as strong. Still crazy windy
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ I thought you blocked her or something haha
@chrisurquhart @sweetandsoward this is great to know.... After I have left for work :(
@ccleary_ yeah it's still raining here. Not as bad as last night was though
@ccleary_ yeah it was crazy
@pattonmeister Reynolds out is fine. If they are full strength around that. Sutton/Walker match fit are needed.
@sweetandsoward same. my backyard is flooded looks like a lake. Sadly my front is fine so I can leave
@sweetandsoward I was thinking the same about work... We never get the blackouts others do :(
@former_legend and do as @normyzee does drive without headlights on
@notbreerose I have one... Clothes just gets me charged
@notbreerose I can't be arsed doing most things...yet I get no front page
@sianstevens4 Should make them fight for life
@cmw12_ I can handle that :D
@cmw12_ So we do your tests for you aswell?
@sweetandsoward they will need more points given they have the wind the 1st half
@normyzee @njc829103 @thecraigbrown easy to critise when you cancel games like this
@abwhispers @theriffmarn the Kite injury will force Ivan into changes to our poor front row atleast
@readingtheplay @7th_tackle There's clearly more too it then bad luck
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @normyzee guys. Someone would drown taking a dive in soccer...smart move
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward you would hate my garage.... All Panthers stuff &amp; all framed
@sweetandsoward I was like that with my dvd of me playing before a Panthers game. Still have it atleast
@sweetandsoward have you framed it or something?
@suthodan hopefully QLD pick him for that reason
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ I don't want Sharks to jump us though.
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ I think we will be lucky to see a try fullstop. a hard game before we play Sharks would be nice
@ccleary_ Idris didn't leave the field in a brace like they both did. That tells me it's bad enough to miss games but not the season
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ no Gallen or Fifita's should ensure Souths win
@sianstevens4 too much hard work..
@sianstevens4 If there's gravy aswell how could he say no
@sianstevens4 depends what specials the bistro has on that night
@sianstevens4 well he is single haha
@sianstevens4 just like being back home....well aside from the 2 jumpers being worn
@normyzee @njc829103 He won't play for another club. I am hoping he gets a bad offer &amp; goes to boxing
@joeljpienmunne1 @sportsbetcomau no chance
@njc829103 @normyzee tbh can't think of anyone else that would take him
@bostonnnnnn yeah it's mad. you cook yourself so can fold the steak over stack more on
@pattonmeister @the_red_heifer yeah Brookvale doesn't tick any of the boxes. Hills are even too shallow
@amarief10 haha. Someone really hates hin
@suthodan ticks most boxes except leaving can be shit.... Oh &amp; being a rain magnet
@bostonnnnnn I always go there. They have the best Dianne sauce &amp; you serve yourself so can stack it on
@armchairride @sandylanceley I have no doubt.
@pattonmeister mine's 10mins from there. I will come &amp; say hi before the gsme
@suthodan to be fair any parent letting their kid read the DT should get their kids taken off them.
@mitch_j_hooper @sandylanceley exactly. Him doing body shots or calling someone that can't skoll a girl is sexist. This isn't
@notbreerose well they are pale. They don't want shit stains on them
@mitch_j_hooper @sandylanceley femanists piss me off getting outraged over things that aren't remotely sexist
@sandylanceley she seems like a real nutcase
@amarief10 police 10-7 needs to film a season there. Should only take a day to get enough footage
@sandylanceley @smh @stephrice88 in the real world. Ppl skoll beers. Women too...plenty of Abbott stuff ups to go after
@bostonnnnnn yeah very under rated
@amarief10 Could be worse I could live in Bundaberg...sunny but a hole
@amarief10 yeah rub it in!
@pattonmeister Shark park is like a bad weather magnet. Are you coming on Sunday?
@mitch_j_hooper KFC doesn't get shown enough during games....needed to be on the jersey
@andycee007 @andy_seags @uncyd not as sick as the AFL fan
@andy_seags @andycee007 BLOCKED
@mitch_j_hooper @pattonmeister @uncyd in a room full of guys....the monster
@amarief10 and you're from Engerland
@mitch_j_hooper @pattonmeister @uncyd is the DT mentioning it? Might be from the left media because it's him. Far bigger issues
@pattonmeister @uncyd I call it staged from him to take focus off poor results
@normyzee @andrewvossy @the_red_heifer Again though another case of when the VR should come in but didn't.
@sweetandsoward yeah I guess would be cold regardless anyway
@normyzee they wouldn't even be able to see the dash. to know speeds and stuff.
@abwhispers @theriffmarn Sowie's is a perfect example. Trying to injury manage all year when it could of got done in the offseason
@the_red_heifer @andrewvossy @jontag23 @oneeyedtiger_ yep had to go 50m still. Which wasn't done the 52mins before that
@normyzee dickheads always do that even at night
@pattonmeister I was there just before it. Left at 6. It's one area Baird has fallen behind is law &amp; order
@sweetandsoward you can't wear pants? That's a strict school. Is it atleast warm enough?
@sweetandsoward Yeah it would. Your uniform would look different on you aswell haha.
@normyzee @sydneyroosters there's more than 1 of them?
@sweetandsoward no makeup looks better on girls anyway.
@untill88 @abwhispers @theriffmarn we showed more urgency in defence last year. If attitude changes then for sure
@notbreerose the last great year we had.
@amarief10 @normyzee as nice as NZ can be anyway... you guys have had plenty of nice weather lately
@bechararob @warrensmithfox tell me a sport in the world that has no ref errors?
@andrewvossy @thecraigbrown &amp; was on the halfway line not like they were attacking the line
@normyzee @amarief10 what about the fact I have a lake in my backyard
@sweetandsoward tell me about it. Standing on the station in cold &amp; rain...not fun
@sweetandsoward school day... Be excited!
@andycee007 they shouldn't but do you want to squeeze in next to them? I'd rather stand
@sianstevens4 shit is it? Thanks for that now I know
@normyzee @amarief10 it always rains in Penrith
@amarief10 yes evil evil thing
@theriffmarn @abwhispers true we might get our defence &amp; forwards in order by then aswell
@sweetandsoward that will be so good for you. 2 days rather then 5
@abwhispers @theriffmarn don't have good records in Bris, Brookie, 2 games v Souths &amp; Melb make it a bad run home.
@theriffmarn @abwhispers 4/4 is good. I see this run home harder than last yr. I see us getting 12 wins &amp; just missing out
@sweetandsoward that sounds so cool &amp; gets you into uni :D
@sweetandsoward what course is it? My ex didn't finish school &amp; is crazy rich so can work
@sweetandsoward goodbye school!
@normyzee haha. At these ppl pretty much every tackle can be penalised. Not all go the 1 way
@njc829103 @normyzee same. No parking in the middle of no where no seats
@normyzee don't think the fans care about it as much as the dinosaurs in the media does
@normyzee only holds 17.5 now so not far off. I think LO is over rated so won't sellout
@juanfarkall &amp; why we lose every year
@juanfarkall haha. How funny was that
@njc829103 @normyzee yep but enough doubt to need the VR. Need more of it
lol Gidley. Needing to score last tackle takes the tackle
@normyzee yeah but they didn't know about the players outside maybe being offside.
@juanfarkall @the_red_heifer should just retire
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @sandylanceley @thenrlfixer if he's avail I'd pick him not after his injury
@suthodan nope. Shouldn't matter pick the best halves
@sweetandsoward A great welcome back to you
@sandylanceley @njc829103 @thecraigbrown @thenrlfixer that's why barring injury again. We will lose the series
@thecraigbrown @juanfarkall @thenrlfixer no other club halves are going better. Mullen/Soward would be my pick
@theriffmarn @abwhispers play Mel &amp; Souths twice in those last 18 rounds though. A loss next wk I'd say we are gone
@juanfarkall @thecraigbrown @thenrlfixer I wasn't impressed by the halves last yr but you go the best 2 not just club pairs
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @thenrlfixer why not pick the 2 best halves regardless of what club they play for?
@mybsidelife @fitmoments @natetaylor87 @petervlang @theriffmarn the same conditions other teams use yet don't get injured?
@Penrithpanthers yesterday @nyrangers today.... A great weekend for teams I follow!
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @thenrlfixer QLDers pick their best 17. We pick Origin type players... yet fail
@theriffmarn of course but the structures stay in place. Come SOO time Melb will still be hard to beat
@theriffmarn of course but proves distruptions can be overcome. Not sure why they can but NRL struggles
@sweetandsoward We have that rep week in 2 weeks. That's 6 weeks
@normyzee @njc829103 @rl_ratings The sooner ppl stop reading his dribble the best
@nikkers4you Haha. I was at the RSL too went back to Panthers less old people
@boozerothfield @sianstevens4 I can't spell the other 2 but agree with beer
@sianstevens4 No greater word
@amarief10 I want us to win so will say he won't play
@amarief10 What a shame another player out of the test
@amarief10 Luckily for me Rangers don't play until 10am get to sleep in
@amarief10 Haha. The weekend brings them out..
@amarief10 Someone's drunk
@njc829103 @normyzee We had more at NSW Cup then was at GC
Quick maths shows @Penrithpanthers NSW Cup team took the field with 12 unavailables incl spine yet won. NRL side can learn that attitude
@normyzee People were prob at the beach
@sandylanceley @suthodan Of course.
@chickoonaroll @sweetandsoward Well you don't want to do the boring hard stuff... You deserve to be 12th
@sweetandsoward Yeah they better
@sweetandsoward We must have the same tips haha
@amarief10 Join the club. Both our teams need a ruthless coach
@theriffmarn @andrewvossy @penrithpanthers I can't of a week when he's not our best player
@theriffmarn no matter the 17 that takes the field. They always perform... NRL can learn plenty off them
@amarief10 one of the many head scratches you get from the referees
@amarief10 @leaguefreak just remember I told you 1st that we won't make the 8
@pattonmeister we don't have the ruthless side needed to be have a long successful run
@pattonmeister we never go back to back into finals. Yet both lower grades won with similar injury issues.
@pattonmeister Ppl are in delusion over how bad we are &amp; want other excuses
@pattonmeister Where did I blame them? We are an ave team &amp; lose for that reason. GC had a fair try called back also. Refs were bad fullstop
@chickoonaroll @pantheraddict too frequent to be just bad luck
@pantheraddict @chickoonaroll something I have wondered for awhile
@thecraigbrown yep. hopefully that's the tone for the rest of the season
@njc829103 that was my point with the tries v NQ. Shouldn't been over ruled
@njc829103 @normyzee @pattonmeister of course look at the ball we had &amp; did nothing with it
@normyzee @pattonmeister look at the penalties they blow. Tell me how does Blake help getting caught in Taylor's leg?
@pattonmeister they haven't helped but we didn't lose from them
That was a try but you can't over rule it on that evidence
@blackholepanthe not just that. The piggy back penalties also
@gc_anthony he's been just as bad for us. Those 2 Blake penalties were garbage
@blackholepanthe we are carving them up just losing patience. Could of had 3 more tries with some
we fix our errors we win. Pretty much identical to Round 2 against them
@leaguefreak the white is so much better
@bostonnnnnn there's more at Panthers then at that game
Coathangers not even on report now hey @nrl
Karma for that bullshit Penalty
@blackholepanthe yep. Errors very costly
@sweetandsoward simple errors are killing us
how good do the @penrithpanthers look with a decent halfback running the show
@sweetandsoward that was never in doubt ;-)
@amarief10 no one born in NSW or QLD should support any AFL team
@sweetandsoward Me &amp; a packed Panthers agree with that
@njc829103 @theriffmarn 4-4 is the bare minimum we need to be at. Whare, ET, Brown &amp; Sowie all should be back rnd 9
@theriffmarn should capt NSW Cup next year. Like Smith was meant to this year
@njc829103 @theriffmarn only a bruised knee but after next week is bye so if we get the win here. I'd rest him again
@sianstevens4 we are too soft. We need to stop taking shit from everyone
Boo Jed Cartwright toe punt like your dad did!
@mitch_j_hooper that explains the poor choice in team
Go @Penrithpanthers we will take some beating in NYC
@mitch_j_hooper I am always hockey. Off season was all NYR from me
@sweetandsoward sure is. It's why I am here right now
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore no he wasn't. You're wrong
@rossmartin1960 @adamhawse @theriffmarn any guy off contract linked to us...we must not have a salary cap
@natetaylor87 @penrithpanthers @sweetandsoward him &amp; Moss both the fastest players we have can never stay on the field
@theriffmarn @penrithpanthers poor guy like Moss has talent yet always gets injured
@mitch_j_hooper @vancanucks boo Canucks
@armchairride I was just thinking the same thing. They should of put that at 5pm
@normyzee @njc829103 huge ratings. However will other codes cope
@sweetandsoward yep. I am coming 4th so need to start getting a few of these right
@sweetandsoward yeah so did I changed it the last time. Computer off now
@njc829103 @boozerothfield @middleton_david I'd say a lifetime
@ccleary_ yeah that's my thinking. Storm don't lose at home but that's with the big 3 playing.
@sweetandsoward it's crazy. Think I will go Roosters they are due though Melb rarely lose at home
@njc829103 @boozerothfield @middleton_david prob easier to count the secs or RL watched sober...
@ccleary_ still haven't decided. Storm are at home so prob them though Roosters are due
@boozerothfield @middleton_david don't you measure your consumation in kegs not cartons?
@ccleary_ Panthers, Cowboys &amp; no idea just tossed a coin
oi @twitter what the hell is with this new update blocking me seeing boobs..
@sweetandsoward again 3 games that can go either way. Must of changed my Mel v Roosters tip 5 times
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @normyzee @thenrlfixer haha. Lego Kreider does that too people
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @normyzee @thenrlfixer it's the worst especially when you win playing badly
@westsydneysport @adelaiderams @boozerothfield hopefully the rams win so Glebe gets in the top 8
@thenrlfixer same thing. They hear Merrin gets $850k &amp; the club offers them a reduced deal than what they have now
@melbchief @readingtheplay yet. They found Essendon not guilty
@thenrlfixer I think players &amp; managers are hearing what others get &amp; are just being too greedy
@nikkers4you I will swap you that for the grot next to me that hasn't seen a shower his whole life
@pattonmeister the fuckwit is 2 days behind. SMH had that story on Wed
@njc829103 @boozerothfield yeah 200 cartons is just a light session for him
@amarief10 LIAR....Roosters have no fans!
@pattonmeister @readingtheplay join the club. Though they can be good if it's a certain useless red head half getting hurt
@pattonmeister @readingtheplay the other game tonight &amp; Roosters/Storm is getting me
@ReadingThePlay @pattonmeister So Stewart's back? Morris not in for Bulldogs can see why the money is coming in
@pattonmeister @ReadingThePlay That's why I picked them. Bulldogs got plenty of players out aswell
@sweetandsoward I am thinking Broncos mainly due to them playing big games already this yr might give them the edge. Manly's due for a win
@sweetandsoward Manly and not keep changing in the Dragons v Broncos game
@sweetandsoward I am the same too many 50/50 games
@andy_seags @twileague Don't the fans hate him &amp; the circus he brought with him?
@mitch_j_hooper @uncyd glasses &amp; Red hair? They are evil those ones
@Mitch_J_Hooper @UncyD Females unlike Star Trek or Star wars fans
@sharkydave44 what a shock. Next you will grow a 2nd head &amp; find your relatives hot
@mitch_j_hooper @uncyd same. I was too busy actually scoring with girls unlike the ppl that watched Star wars &amp; Star trek
@alagich3 Penrith &amp; Melbourne also are after Myles so that's not a certainty..seems strange to me
@uncyd @seaeagles yep far better with a lesser half that will put in each week
@sweetandsoward Rain &amp; being on a Friday night will keep it from selling out. 13k will be a good turnout
@notbreerose so you seen the other pics... It was cold that night
@andycee007 @readingtheplay I sure him play 1st hand on the wkd. You guys had so much ball. Not once did he take on the line or anything
@notbreerose I told grandma to stop sending you those.... I will punish her for it!
@andycee007 @readingtheplay if he put in &amp; won some games. I am sure the attitude would change though not likely
@mrives76 @readingtheplay Didn't Manly pull their offer? Sucks they lost Sezar out of it. Although Family may of sent him away anywaay
@andycee007 @readingtheplay I don't know if they would. All I hear is the fans bagging him &amp; prob rightly so
@ccleary_ @natetaylor87 well you are the biggesr fan out there....1 day mine will get delivered &amp; I will read
@suthodan Golden State had the best record since the 06 Bulls. Tney will take some beating. I'd say them &amp; Clippers WC final
@amarief10 I am the same. Probably as we aren't losers...
@readingtheplay seeing that Myles is likely to leave anyway. Those rumours are just stupid
@ccleary_ @josh_mansour haha atleast I didn't get beat. mine comes sometime tomorrow night.
@suthodan that's being nice
@ccleary_ @josh_mansour haha. You live on the Central coast yet get a copy before me...
@sweetandsoward @pattonmeister my TV &amp; Big League says Dragons game 1st
@pattonmeister ch9 can't even get it right
@wallyfrogmore same here. Tears running down my face
@njc829103 @mrives76 @normyzee @sandylanceley @thecraigbrown @thenrlfixer another that won games single handly.
@wallyfrogmore fucking funny show
@sharkydave44 @theriffmarn yeah but we need old heads still. An old head that can gain 100m per game min ideally. That's him
@thecraigbrown yep so true. Lockyer was better than both though
@sharkydave44 @7newssydney @penrithpanthers @theriffmarn you haven't seen our front row in action. I'd take him
@luce_man @gc_anthony @readbthelines @readingtheplay yep. I heard 7 say he's still going up there.
@njc829103 @normyzee GC said DCE is backflipping. Where did this talk come from?
@footyfacts37 @sandylanceley @thecraigbrown Slater's good but will our grandkids be in awe that we saw him play live?
@sandylanceley @footyfacts37 @thecraigbrown JT's point scoring in test &amp; SOO will never get beaten.
@sandylanceley @footyfacts37 @thecraigbrown what features does Slater have to put him in the same class as GI, JT &amp; Smith?
@suthodan I want a GS v Ceveland final
@dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 have you been before? I stayed for few days coming back from LA in 2004....best place on earth
@nat_sinclair93 @dannitequila haha. Watch out Hawaii. They can't handle you 2 girls
@nikkers4you I will run away with you...
@theriffmarn there's no easy games in the comp. Though we have enough talent to win these games if we defend like last week again
@cmw12_ @kimkardashian that googlebox &amp; makeup contract can't come soon enough
@aussieblackwell @niles1991 @sharkydave44 @specialkonline Liver can't come fast enough for that prick
@cmw12_ @kimkardashian blondes are meant to have more fun...ripped off!
@theriffmarn the only one injured we can't replace is Soward. We should win our next 2 before the break
@nikkers4you a phase I say every day
@niles1991 @wallyfrogmore I am looking can't find any NFL in crisis headlines anywhere either
@notbreerose haha. I need to meet those types of sheilas
@suthodan great episode
@amarief10 my vodafone is fine too
@pattonmeister yep. Too many young guys needed to be kept
@normyzee everyone needs a crisis to start the morning
@sharkydave44 @mitch_j_hooper that's why we need an attacking FB. Who with Farah can spark something
@sharkydave44 @mitch_j_hooper that works if we have JT or joey in the 7. We need to score points somewhere
@mitch_j_hooper @sharkydave44 he could go other combos. Fb Moylan. 5/8 Soward gets the same affect
@wallyfrogmore @justinstrong141 @mitch_j_hooper how will she know she's a bitch otherwise?
@amarief10 decent choice for a Brunette
@orangeemptyseat @stuartayresmp @thoughtsofagm nope. He plays AFL or did. I'd say he's a fan of them
@westsydneysport @orangeemptyseat @the_orange_army there isn't enough money in the world. I'd say court appointed CS
@amarief10 yep Bangladesh. They have us then you guys. If they are lucky they win a test match in those series combined
@normyzee @andrewvossy yep. Was dry when we played there last year that's about the only time
@amarief10 do they know what summer is?
@amarief10 with whatever country they can steal them from
@thecraigbrown @mrives76 it's just image. Been seen to be doing something rather then do it.
@steeldawn2012 @mj_lynch what are they getting for that money though? Smart investment not just money is needed but agreed
@mj_lynch @steeldawn2012 @todd_greenberg it's ok. Canberra has plenty of money. Govt money will run out soon enough
@wallyfrogmore Say it. Softcocks that can't handle it can piss off
@pattonmeister @sharkydave44 Because we have shit forwards. Teams that offload and that go well NQ always beat us too
@wallyfrogmore @pattonmeister Yet you weren't hired as the lawyer.... You could of saved your Saints!
@pattonmeister @sharkydave44 Haha. Yeah 2 weeks is good especially as you guys have your set 2 points against us next week
@wallyfrogmore @pattonmeister Haha. It was a swinging arm that broke a guys jaw. 2 weeks is a good result
@thehockeynews @epoole88 @thnkencampbell @aussieblackwell No one is in Nash's level! He should be all alone
@cmw12_ @kaitlynweldon 1st step @googleboxau next step free makeup!
@pattonmeister imagine my shock to finish oztag &amp; find that he was unsuccesful
@cmw12_ @kaitlynweldon there you go @goggleboxau series 2 you have your 1st stars
@andy_seags I have the set of scrubs as in the TV show. You have to dispose of the body do you?
@suthodan yep as hard as a lemonade sandwich
@sweetandsoward I thought both were lucky to get what they got. Surprised either was downgraded
@kassulke yes they sure are
@boozerothfield @amarief10 move over Oct 5 2003....we have a new best day of my life!
@amarief10 @boozerothfield how dare you tarnish that great dhow by putting them both in the same category
@sandylanceley @andrewvossy  @thehutch81 with the 2 new teams in to fund I don't know how much we will give up
@sandylanceley @andrewvossy @foxnrl @thehutch81 the fans would watch would the dinosaurs at the TV networls allow that
@rl_ratings @brisbanetimes sure would. The issue is would the fans &amp; corporates get behind it
@sandylanceley @andrewvossy @foxnrl @thehutch81 Origin wont move from mid week though. Asise from that great idea
@sweetandsoward I can't see him getting off. Maybe getting a down grade
@amarief10 Winter means Hoodies &amp; footy so has it's good points aswell
@nikkers4you haha. close enough is good enough
@normyzee @troydodds would of been interesting to see if the sponsors allowed it for an away game
@normyzee @troydodds well we have a home game. So the sponsors will be everywhere just not on the jersey
@normyzee @troydodds any special jersey is a stunt. The aim is to sell them after all. Good to mix the stunt with goodwill
@sandylanceley @andrewvossy @foxnrl @thehutch81 yep. These test weekends are a start. Need something locked in post season
@aussieblackwell @suthodan should just open the gates for games like that
@uncyd haha. Said by the guy who's team got beaten to a signature by Canberra
@cmw12_ not weird at all. It's the only good part about being injured
@keipert76 yep. They still have the odd gem from series 17 but not the funny episodes
@keipert76 yep. They still have the odd gem then but not the funny episodes
@themattbungard @suthodan haha. They are soccer super powers after all
@andy_seags @suthodan @trentslatts too many man buns &amp; pricks for me to go. I think ever. I'd go if this lineup was BDO or something
@normyzee @njc829103 that's not perfect but better though. Get the cheap seats packed &amp; the crowds grow
@andy_seags @suthodan @trentslatts yet he overlooks the Church being at Splemdor... Not worth going to many hipster pricks
@normyzee @njc829103 can you buy them on the gate at that price?
@amarief10 you can't reach &amp; just take them? Oh yeah are you on private now? I so didn't notice
@nikkers4you yes it's the worse
@amarief10 you could learn something from us in Penrith. fill your pockets with those little complimentary sauces
@suthodan catfish &amp; the bottleman &amp; royalblood are normal bands
@amarief10 You were prob asleep... I can't remember you guys winning any
@amarief10 haha. Yeah that's right you guys always lose these games
@amarief10 they have all the crowd support over there that's why
@amarief10 either that or ink poisoning. she's ruined big time now.
@amarief10 drugs have messed her up bigtime
@andy_seags @sharkydave44 @uncyd @wallyfrogmore same. I here to muck around. nutjobs/cunts I block
@andy_seags @sharkydave44 @uncyd @wallyfrogmore I met normyzee twitter him is just an act.
@amarief10 Yep. Soccer fan only before then. He hates AFL so not all bad
@armchairride bandwagon slightly broken with flare damage
@amarief10 my brother inlaw is born &amp; bred in Sydney yet goes for the Storm. Everytime I see him just want to headbutt him
@amarief10 haha. We have a warm up for the Madonna fight
@uncyd @sharkydave44 @wallyfrogmore I have met a few off here. Some were good others assholes
@sharkydave44 @ajfordays @wallyfrogmore yep. Fake names &amp; 140 characters can't tell you the person
@mrives76 @sharkydave44 haha. Yes that will scare them into re-signing him. He never goes to games anyway
@normyzee @buzzrothfield @njc829103 injury will give some young guys a run anyway
@njc829103 @buzzrothfield @normyzee yep. NZ are strong pick the best team to beat them
@uncyd @crowdiegal @smh you blokes should let him go &amp; sign Isaac John even mid season
@amarief10 haven't you seen them yet?
@sandylanceley @armchairride @njc829103 @shunter86 I took that to mean to cover Wallace. It's long term or not at all
@sandylanceley @armchairride @njc829103 @shunter86 that &amp; Moylan to the halves seem a matter of when not if
@nat_sinclair93 No doubt the 2 best years of your life
@sandylanceley @armchairride @shunter86 yep. Further proving it's likely DT bullshit
@theriffmarn @cp1074pirotta I heard he had a kitchen mishap &amp; cut his hand
@sandylanceley @armchairride @shunter86 Blake played RU up until 2012 so has plenty of reach. He'd be close to that height
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley we don't have the money nor need a test &amp; SOO priced specialist winger
@armchairride People are delusional with him. He's a nobody over there ppl forget that
@armchairride @sandylanceley @shunter86 can't be it. Blake &amp; DWZ are great in the air
@armchairride @sandylanceley @shunter86
@suthodan I said the same thing. Surely against the Burgess monsters and co. He plays
@theriffmarn Both can't be far away. Hopefully next week they deserve a run in the test team
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers he looks better than them all
@sharkydave44 why no Houma? Souths have a huge pack
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn The story came from the DT
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn Even then we have Jennings x 2, Blake &amp; some good one's in NYC. Wingers are last thing we need
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley nothing wrong with our outside backs. Use the money for Masoe
@andy_seags @nrlagent DCE practically moved out of the way when Blake scored. You should get Isaac John for next yr
@andy_seags @nrlagent DCE would go before Foran surely
@sianstevens4 @twitter surely it's easy enough to fix
@nat_sinclair93 have you had her long?
@nat_sinclair93 that's a cute little dog
@natetaylor87 @sweetandsoward Either way will be great to see a Jennings back in the number jersey
@natetaylor87 @sweetandsoward my mate had to go there for something &amp; saw George training not Robert
@njc829103 @normyzee @orangeemptyseat @thecraigbrown I'd imagine tablets mixed with a few kegs wouldn't work very well
@natetaylor87 @sweetandsoward sure it's not George? Whare with a dodgy hammy was always a long shot
@mitch_j_hooper further proof that Hamilton is a fuckwit. Can't stand that knob
@ccleary_ I think Robert is the better centre of the 2 but George is probably more ready for FG. If my fav's out better on of them in
@blonde_mummy who should you do first more like it
@sweetandsoward sucks because Whare is my fav player but you can't rush hamstrings better the extra time
@sweetandsoward yep. Whare needs another week out :( .
@mitch_j_hooper In for Idris DWZ won't get much ball apart from that. He will do a decent job
Welcome back to FG George Jennings.
@amarief10 A goddess. In the top 10 hottest people on earth
@sharkydave44 @aussieblackwell captained test &amp; SOO sides that JT has played in. It's a good debate to have
@aussieblackwell @sharkydave44 I look at JT's point records in SOO &amp; Test. Wont ever see that beaten but GI &amp; Smith have done plenty
@theriffmarn ideally Brown &amp; Whare are fit. If not Bryce &amp; R.Jennings
@aussieblackwell @sharkydave44 does his lack of a GF win (As a starter) keep him down in ppls mind
@pattonmeister Soward &amp; Keary
@wallyfrogmore I have told @notbreerose about her before. So hot
@wallyfrogmore yes hottest chick on tv for sure
@sianstevens4 mine did the same. Just before Redfern stopped
@mtweet80 Our batters need to get atleast some runs. So he gets them to atleast 200 each innings
@mtweet80 so you missed his 170 he scored on the wkd I take it. He's still their best player
@amarief10 great you can speak to someone &amp; get my baning from that wonderful place lifted
@nikkers4you haha. Sounds like my workplace.
@notbreerose well almost getting there
@cmw12_ ah technology a wonderful thing
@amarief10 I can loan my black &amp; white TV to get that... Deal
@amarief10 Still $39.90?
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward yes left handers rule
@amarief10 Owen I mean
@amarief10 after you fight Gerrard. Madonna's next?
@amarief10 well you need to own someone!
@dennistesia @joeljpienmunne1 NZ, WT &amp; GC are teams you guys will be fighting for the 8. To lose all 3 is a poor result
@the_red_heifer @buzzrothfield so does the whole RL world
@joeljpienmunne1 to be fair they did lose to the team I think will win the comp.
@mtweet80 @njc829103 that's the true figures we need. That keeps the clubs bank accounts ticking over
@myteamstorm @mtweet80 @njc829103 yeah will rate 300k easily.
@sweetandsoward haha. I looked. Didn't smile. 3rd on NSW Cup on the other hand...
@mtweet80 @njc829103 yep. I don't care for members that just get the sticker &amp; keyring. Show the numbers that have tickets
@myteamstorm @mtweet80 @njc829103 less than half of a teams members though? On a dry night
@mtweet80 @njc829103 the issue is the dinosaurs that think Leagues club membership is the same. 100k member in their minds
@sweetandsoward yes it has been awhile
@njc829103 @mtweet80 look at us. 15k members yet only really 8k that's always there
@thecraigbrown @andrewvossy @normyzee a weeks suspension will soon fix it. Oh and give them as tries
@normyzee @njc829103 @thenrlfixer on field happens so fast. Player on the ground. That's fine it's the VR issue
@normyzee @njc829103 then Dave Smith needs to step in. We don't need yes men anywhere in the game
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @normyzee as a fb he should know what's obstructed &amp; what's not. Always gets it wrong
@normyzee @njc829103 yep if the defence makes an attempt so be no try. Cases like this instant try
@normyzee @njc829103 I thought we had the ex player in the box to give the players point of view.
@normyzee @njc829103 the checklist they use doesn't allow for that. I say get rid of the checklists
@normyzee @njc829103 that was the case with the Austin &amp; Storm DM too. Common sense needs to be used sometimes
@normyzee @njc829103 that's why it was no try on the field. Replays showed no one impeded. Black &amp; white rules don't work
@sweetandsoward I went Cowboys
@theriffmarn @njc829103 A back &amp; Forward should be there to be used if a concussion or foul play forces someone out
@normyzee @njc829103 Again VR stuff up. I can understand the ref giving no try.
@amarief10 yep. Poor decision
@njc829103 @theriffmarn yep. Left us with a re shuffled backline. Imagine having a NYC guy there just in case
@theriffmarn yes. It's crazy a legal shot can leave another team short
@cmw12_ I will pass the hat around next game
@theriffmarn @nswrl @penrithpanthers very strange would of built the crowd nicely
@nat_sinclair93 @ccleary_ of course we will. Waqa Blake looks like a star in the making. Will miss Jamal's defence though
@nat_sinclair93 haha. She seems to be in moment
@gc_anthony @gctitans @nrl I think in NYC Waqa Blake was faster in tests but very close
@sandylanceley @mitch_j_hooper great at that. Cost a few tries since being back rushing in off his wing
@ccleary_ haha. Found it
@sandylanceley @mitch_j_hooper providing he stays on his wing like last week
@ccleary_ haha. Nice trick there's no pic
@mitch_j_hooper Robert Jennings, Will Smith are the next 2 in line
@sandylanceley @njc829103 yep. Got a poor passing game &amp; ave at reading in defence. As a centre 4th choice still
@sandylanceley @njc829103 yes we have no one even close to the role
@mitch_j_hooper won't play centre. Aver at Passing &amp; defence. Blake will get the job
@sandylanceley @njc829103 Blake's the incumbent and looked pretty good. Jennings is still 18 so not quite there yet
@njc829103 @sandylanceley attack we are fine for Blake &amp; Snith. Defence is the big loss
@amarief10 some's better than none haha
@amarief10 I pictured you on ever wearing running shoes &amp; footy jerseys
@sweetandsoward I have never watched it haha
@wallyfrogmore haha. Was expecting that from you
@suthodan yep. Keeps the grubs at bay
@suthodan that's the way to keep them. Re-sign 18months out at a time
@wallyfrogmore can't sing, is a cow &amp; is ugly as all fuck makes me wonder how bad was Kurt's beer googles
@wallyfrogmore Courtney Love can get the fuck off especially!
@amarief10 haha. You in heels that's a sight to see
@wallyfrogmore nope the blonde wife is better than the music..yes I give Cookie a go
@wallyfrogmore yeah good show. Terrible music though
@pattonmeister I replace that with any drug. Just don't see the thrill
@sianstevens4 this case is so sad. I am hoping the birth parents or someone took him &amp; he's safe
@thecraigbrown @juanfarkall @normyzee true. Though they didn't do the illegal hit. Should not care the affect to the score
@juanfarkall @normyzee @thecraigbrown aside from Hoppa's finger in the arse 99.9% of suspensions are accidents
@juanfarkall @normyzee @thecraigbrown shouldn't matter but clearly did
@juanfarkall @normyzee @thecraigbrown was it 18-6 at the time? Refs might not of wanted to ruin a finish
@thecraigbrown @juanfarkall @normyzee the fact he was falling is the only reason I can think why he wasn't sent
@juanfarkall @normyzee @thecraigbrown he was sent off. Deserved but they do go in lower grades just not NRL
@thecraigbrown @juanfarkall @normyzee Docker for us got 3 weeks and knocked 3 teeth out. Frizell will get the same I'd say
@amarief10 or belted his missus. Far worse
@amarief10 that Hurrell thing was the biggest over reaction ever. It was a legal act
@thecraigbrown @boringnrlguy Strange some names just equal hotness
@thecraigbrown @boringnrlguy Her name is Sarah. I have yet to meet an ugly Sarah
@cmw12_ Haha. Yes you girls need that
@abwhispers @sandylanceley @theriffmarn Idris was also meant to be out til round 3. Soward is training now 3 weeks &amp; he'd close to playing
@abwhispers @sandylanceley @theriffmarn yeah does NSW Cup media work. He has contacts. Stew knows his stuff
@njc829103 @abcnewsmelb @sandylanceley yep. Plenty of Men sports don't get coverage either
@boozerothfield @normyzee @sianstevens4 @thenrlfixer you throw up crayons every day... Nothing special there
@uncyd @andy_seags I'd back any MotoGP bike to beat McLaren
@thenrlfixer @normyzee @sianstevens4 you're right. Nutcases would love the pickles never would throw them
@sweetandsoward yes it was a great night
@sianstevens4 @normyzee or maccas pickles. What other purpose do they have?
@sianstevens4 I am sure the nutcases that follow them will think of something
@nikkers4you Ok. What did you want?
@sharkydave44 yep. Considering all the education they get aswell. Not like normal kids
@uncyd F1 is on too.
@waller_kyle @sandylanceley @theriffmarn we missed 50 tackles in both those games. Attack was great due to Sowie covered it.
@normyzee @jgto @smhsport They need to realise they are someone's daughter &amp; it's not on
@sharkydave44 pre season he was arrested again. Booze is his problem
@waller_kyle @sandylanceley @theriffmarn i think we played poor in rnd 1 &amp; 2. The losses made us work on stuff
@sharkydave44 off field he's got problems. Better to keep him comfortable onfield
@normyzee @jgto @smhsport yep. Chairmen can't be doing stuff like that.
@sharkydave44 we played him there a few times. He's was too lazy &amp; got caught out a few times
@thenrlfixer old management but yep that too. We had the prick Gus sacking ppl yet a couple still like the club
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn @waller_kyle those losses had to happen to get us right mentally
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley @waller_kyle atleast NQ &amp; Roosters will be top 4 teams
@amarief10 yes he's the best RL commentator we have
@thenrlfixer the fact they had DCE all but locked up yet blew it shows how bad they are
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn @waller_kyle despite a harder draw &amp; the injuries
@waller_kyle @sandylanceley @theriffmarn 4-4 gives the same start as last season
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward I could of been home at 930! Panthers was calling my name though
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers All 3 grades winning despite the injures. Fantastic
@suthodan I watched him against us in round 4. Terrible. Had 6 errors &amp; 5 missed on Friday night
@chickoonaroll without fail. Put a camera infront of me &amp; I will look drunk
@chickoonaroll atleast you don't always look drunk in photos like I do
@thecraigbrown @uncyd I was worried he would try too much. We had no ball for that too happen
@sweetandsoward @sowwowofficial haha. I don't know who's smile is bigger
@thecraigbrown @uncyd Wallace ignored Api/Blake/Mansour last week. Having 2 kids let Moylan what was infront of him
@thecraigbrown @uncyd rookie mistake. Wallace is shit. He ruins our attack
@uncyd @thecraigbrown once Wallace was ruled out we were certain to win
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers A better drive than last week atleast.
@suthodan I take it you haven't watched him this year? He's been dreadful
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ Haha. Nice work!
@andy_seags @dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 @penrithpanthers Haha. No I dropped it when Mansour threw it into the crowd after the game
@chandler_bang @leaguefreak I have said that since we signed him. Terrible kicking game doesn't take on the line.
@lcurtin79 @pantherman45 @petervlang Wasn't just that. The triple pump before passing it. Regardless much better from Peachey
@leaguefreak we won 22-12. No Wallace = win for us...
@pattonmeister Played the full game but mostly in the halves.
@normyzee @penrithpanthers Yep no idea where our mythical members are. Sure ad he'll never go to the games!
@dannitequila It's great feeling all 3 grades winning makes the vodka taste so much better!
@nat_sinclair93 @dannitequila @penrithpanthers Yeah to have that little ball. Players to go off hurt &amp; still win. Great effort
@dannitequila We sure are. Great defence
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn Yeah very interesting. I liked our attack tonight use both sides of the field. Decent kicking game
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn Not being a Wallace fan while terrible for him. I think we will play better as a team without him
@andy_seags @dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 Nope but it rubs it in more
@dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 How good was it. BTW @Andy_Seags the girls looked smoking hot tonight
@suthodan We made 60 more tackles than them. They had their chances can't blame the ref
See @penrithpanthers fans we can win without Soward just need that useless Wallace gone aswell
Anyone own a Bobcat? needed to dig Wolfman out of the ground. Pumped trying to stop a try
lol @ Wolfman in NSW Cup. 100 injuries still can't get a run
@sweetandsoward yep. I had shorts on for NYC far better weather
@andy_seags run at Mansour's wing has worked for the other teams in our losses. No Wallace means we score points tonight
@sweetandsoward Penrith is waiting... Better weather this time!
@nat_sinclair93 I was just down at the booth haha
@abwhispers @jackdorrigo1917 @pantherman45 @theriffmarn Manu was named. I'd say Plum backrow. Kite on bench
@petervlang someone had to go
@jackdorrigo1917 @abwhispers @pantherman45 @theriffmarn Bryce? Form he's not the only one struggling though
@abwhispers @jackdorrigo1917 @pantherman45 @theriffmarn having 2 young guys means we will go left &amp; right in attack
@pantherman45 @abwhispers @jackdorrigo1917 @theriffmarn Idris will play just short week maintenance. Wallace being out could be a good thing
@sianstevens4 yes 1 of the best
@andycee007 true. Don't worry we have the useless Wallace playing
@pantherman45 @abwhispers @jackdorrigo1917 @theriffmarn 14k should be the bare minimum. Prove we deserve more games here
@sianstevens4 haha. Good I am not the only one that lost on it
@theriffmarn @abwhispers @jackdorrigo1917 @pantherman45 yep got a nice day. The timeslot we want no excuse not to get a crowd
@njc829103 @theriffmarn our ideal timeslot according to fans. Nice &amp; sunny. Really no excuses
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers it's a great day for it
@njc829103 that was only 40 degrees &amp; had a big away supporters.
Good to finally get a dry day for a game at Pepper Stadium
@sweetandsoward Haha. So milk &amp; bread 5 hours then
@theriffmarn 14k should be minimum for tonight. anything less is a disgrace
@sweetandsoward quick shopping in girl speak is 4 hours?
@mrives76 @tenash921 @thecraigbrown yes imagine where they would be without that exposure
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister because Barba played his natural game. Put him in 6 but Bird/Graham ball play &amp; Barba/Holmes coming off that
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister yep. Every fullback will get belted running the ball back etc at some stage. The sooner the better imo
@the_red_heifer it's ok. They have therapists dealing with just that problem.
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister yep. You'd think only injury will stop him or stupidity coaching playing him on the wing etc
@bostonnnnnn Ennis
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister that's what you want from a fb. All the good teams have that back there
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward I still stil with ppl from 10yrs ago. It's good always have ppl to talk too
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward it's great that you 2 girls are so close :)
@dazza_20 @penrithpanthers @sweetandsoward yes would be a great choice. Wouldn't let us down on the field either
@the_red_heifer Aldi crowd or sheltered workshop....same really
@sweetandsoward nothing better than footy day!
@ccleary_ @penrithpanthers yep. Lets hope that rain stays away now too
@amarief10 I just can't cheer for those pricks though
@normyzee anyone answered? There's no Roosters fans that's your problem
@pattonmeister Yep. Coote, Gordon left us ok. That Lewis fuckwit on the other hand
@pattonmeister Haha. I wish Bris game. Though Wallace being hurt is almost as good
@sweetandsoward I just noticed that
@pattonmeister Isn't that awesome. Jenko did that for us in the semi last year. Everyone laughed &amp; cheered
@pattonmeister Both Fifita's could miss sometime. Should be a good game when we play in a fortnight
@pattonmeister That flair could be the difference over Dragons etc to get in the 8
@pattonmeister They had chances just dropped it every time. Yep they are a bottom 4 team. You guys played alright but  cruised
@pattonmeister Yes Hadley is terrible even worse than then shit Newcastle is dishing up
@sweetandsoward Yes can it be tomorrow yet
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ Copycat
@misshunter10 Fair trade
@ccleary_ Parra, Warriors &amp; us
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward my mate said the same thing when I wanted dreadlocks.He ended up copying me &amp; getting them
@ccleary_ it's not raining here tonight. Hopefully it stays like that.
@sweetandsoward @kyliejenner I will guess 500
@sweetandsoward @kyliejenner I will count down the days for you
@misshunter10 I wouldn't give them any...teach them to laugh
@sharkydave44 @harrison_coach @suthodan such an under rated band
@sweetandsoward @kyliejenner haha. Next year it can be yours
@andy_seags @twileague of course they don't... Supermodels have nothing on Pantherettes
@sweetandsoward aww that sucks... Mine came after yours. Wrong order but had an extra garlic bread so won't complain
lol Rabs. Oates is bigger than a backrower... Because he is a backrower
@sweetandsoward I don't think mine will come in time for our game tomorrow :(
@sandylanceley @mrives76 &amp; get the strange over rules we get now. On field calls are pretty good it's VR that's the issue
@sandylanceley @mrives76 captains call like in cricket. Something balant missed they will call it
@sweetandsoward yep I ordered it in plenty of time aswell
@mrives76 that's my issue with the VR. He should just look for the howler not try to change 50/50 calls
@stuart_maurice @thenrlfixer or an endless supply of girls in a yellow dress
@sweetandsoward I was thinking the same. I ordered at 630...Footy's on yet no pizza
@thecraigbrown @andycee007 @normyzee further proof the 90's were the best!
@andycee007 yeah it's converting now. Thanks I changed my laptop &amp; just had windows player
So given Technology hates me. Someone help. Do I need itunes to put songs from my ipod onto a computer?
1 HAM 1:37.219
2 RAI 1:37.662

4 VET 1:38.339
5 ROS 1:38.399
#ChineseGP 
@sharkydave44 didn't play much senior footy but he was only fast. Most backs have that
@sharkydave44 he's pretty good but can't see him getting the number 1 jersey
@sweetandsoward All 3 grades means I will see atleast 1 win haha
@sweetandsoward so am I. I can't wait
@sianstevens4 haha. I hate it when that happens
@oneeyedtiger_ haha. Yeah work week sucked but NYR won the Presidents Cup so week was great
@mitch_j_hooper @nikkers4you that's strange. Still Brits don't shower or can play sport... Far better role models then them
@nikkers4you Is there more than 1? Looks pretty straight forward to me
@WTFfactx @Andy_Seags That's a wonderful pic... Very wpnderful
@sweetandsoward Haha. Yes would be nice for me too
@sweetandsoward I look forward to seeing it
@sweetandsoward haha. mine was the same when I had dreadlocks.... The day I finished. I got them!!
@sweetandsoward Haha. book the hairdressers today
@TheRiffMarn enforced means injured... Not dropped as well
@sweetandsoward Haha. Steal the style of it
@TheRiffMarn At the this stage is interesting wording
@Amarief10 Haha. To be a fly on the wall when they sort him out
@Amarief10 Haha. Tinder strikes again. I take it they both know about the other?
RIP Richie Benuad
@wallyfrogmore haha. The scum of Australia
@sianstevens4 @twitter plenty of people have said that. Surely they will change it now
@sianstevens4 @twitter yes it's so much worse now
@njc829103 @boozerothfield liar. You wont waste booze
@mitch_j_hooper @sharkydave44 @wallyfrogmore same. Perving on chick. Drove the cart in the water...i wasn't even playing!
@wallyfrogmore @mitch_j_hooper @sharkydave44 that's me at Aqua golf. Hit the boat that gets the balls once
@sharkydave44 yes. It's one of those sports that shouldn't be...
@sharkydave44 yes so fucken boring
@nikkers4you that's not good then :(
@nikkers4you haha. So a normal smelling train than
@amarief10 I'd be thankful they actually spole footy expecially mentioning the Warriors
@sweetandsoward Well it's good but doesn't help me haha
@sweetandsoward How do you get these free tickets?
@wallyfrogmore @abc2 I like the 1st few seasons they are up to the shit now
@sweetandsoward I lost my login password. Resigned up my new one is going better and just has the away teams haha
@wallyfrogmore @abc2 Yeah that show sucks tonight atleast was decent shows
@wallyfrogmore @abc2 Atleast it had the inbetweeners before it tonight
@sweetandsoward Probably more than me haha
@amarief10 @nrlfootyshow Only if you keep them over there
@mj_lynch @smh Seems a no brainer really
@suthodan something Flanno isn't known for.
@andy_seags @suthodan Ricky hates skillful players. So rule them out
@suthodan GC wouldn't of let Sezar go if Elgey was going. Cornish at 7 can direct the team &amp; go from there. Bird or Brown in 6 even
@mischamaxwell haha. Who doesn't miss se.... Um vegemite
@andy_seags @suthodan yep &amp; that leaves the future immortal Ayshford with no position
@sweetandsoward he would of known he would get booed
@suthodan Elgey is staying up there. Cornish would do a good job
@ccleary_ haha. plenty of worse reasons to have a bromance with someone
@nikkers4you you don't have any good painkillers?
@amarief10 yep. Been here for years
@thenrlfixer DCE, Another centre &amp; say Thaiday or someone, covers for Elgey not quite being there yet
@amarief10 ahh...so I am not missing much. Not watching that show
@thenrlfixer Elgey or Sezar had to go though. Bird &amp; Myles going could be a they are bad off field influences. New start type of thing
@thenrlfixer did they want to keep him is the question? They want Gagai and can't if they have Sezar
@sweetandsoward haha. You are easily pleased
@shannenleee1 haha. You should job swap with them
@sharkydave44 @juanfarkall @readingtheplay Given Ricky's record we can expect him to play SOO then?
@normyzee yes. A sad day for all
@jgto @foxnrl @readingtheplay the only player the Roosters have developed
@njc829103 @theriffmarn yeah I am thinking that
@sharkydave44 @juanfarkall @readingtheplay Cornish looks decent only 10 games in. Could be great
@theriffmarn Cornish has only played 10 games or something
@theriffmarn I rate Austin better. Strange seeing all the halves they have
@juanfarkall @readingtheplay @sharkydave44 besides that Austin is better than Sezar
@tiinaa_xo @ccleary_ that's lovely to say
@boringnrlguy or the greatest year ever
@normyzee @tennewssydney I have wondered that. Maybe so the wives/husbands at home can turn dinner off so not to burn
@normyzee @newstalk2ue yes a sad day indeed
@notbreerose it's because you are rich. Meth heads love shit things
@sianstevens4 @twitter further proof that hashtags are for idiots
@mitch_j_hooper No more than usual. I have never been a fan of his
@mitch_j_hooper that's the way I would go or Tupou. Mansour is barely NRL standard ATM
@cnn @notbreerose ahh the child of God speaks
@notbreerose I will just loan you prunes
@mitch_j_hooper depends on the centres. 4nations last year. Walker was poor GI could of done better
@natetaylor87 @jackdorrigo1917 look at our players that going bad...all had limited prep. Needed a NSW Cup run imo
@mitch_j_hooper Moylan would get owned on the wing too small. Move GI to centre, J,Moz wing &amp; Moylan at FB works
@mitch_j_hooper Mansour won't be there. There's rumours he will dropped this week
@sweetandsoward lucky guess. What are you doing for it?
@sweetandsoward I am going to guess you
@armchairride yep. They are worse than the on field by a mile
@sianstevens4 @normyzee @sandylanceley @thecraigbrown a WWC check should of picked that up.. This is tragic would be worse if it was student
@amarief10 Vegemite is the shit fullstop
@normyzee @sandylanceley @sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown well then heads will roll if so.
@normyzee @sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown working at a school you would hope not
@sandylanceley @normyzee @sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown gee what a nutjob. Just tragic
@normyzee @sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown of course they are on to something. May not be murder hopefully
@normyzee Roosters fans? Roosterfan is more realistic
@mitch_j_hooper nope. You'd assume it's just weekends &amp; peak times being Casual
@cmw12_ @andy_seags @erin_molan @jessgilarte @kaitlynweldon @nrlfootyshow either way it would be an all Panther final
@wallyfrogmore @dragonsfan1988 @mitch_j_hooper @pnfinn what happened to him? Looked a decent player
@andy_seags @mitch_j_hooper @sianstevens4 given the high profile case I can't see the judge falling for bleeding heart stories
@normyzee @sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown we all remember William Tyrell's so called murderer face everywhere so they can be wrong.
@pattonmeister it happens. We need 2 players on the bench that back up just in case
@pattonmeister nah not them. Take out 2 forwards early &amp; have them play with a 2 man bench for 60mins... Should be extra players
@thecraigbrown @sianstevens4 no body yet but agreed doesn't look good
@armchairride @normyzee Selling flares on the side aswell?
@penrithpanthers @nrl @seaeagles @sweetandsoward all 3 grades...there's nothing better!
@sianstevens4 @thecraigbrown school holidays aswell. Lets hope he's just got her tied up somewhere or something
@thecraigbrown @sianstevens4 no doubt has watched and/or stalked her for awhile. Sicko
@thenrlfixer yeah it's strange that all have the same issue. I am sure they test the products &amp; still stuff it
@thecraigbrown @sianstevens4 yeah will be interesting to see the link. I can't see the reason behind it regardless
@pattonmeister community is funny as. Pretty much anything that wins awards we don't get here is too good for our FTA networks
@sianstevens4 yeah another pointless death at the hand of a dropkick
@thenrlfixer yes it's the worst. They never get under your chin
@andy_seags @cmw12_ @jessgilarte @kaitlynweldon like with our footy players...every squad need to come out here &amp; fill out their squad
@sweetandsoward haha. I'd use it right now on the train
@sianstevens4 did you see her? She was hot no doubt a nutcase stalker got her
@telegraph_sport @jimmyhooper @westsydneysport If only I could see someome training in the paper every day...
@sweetandsoward I am always thinking we need a up yours emij
@andy_seags @cmw12_ @jessgilarte @kaitlynweldon good point maybe they can set up recruitment offices in Penrith
@sweetandsoward which is the only one you need
@normyzee haha.
@normyzee @nrl ha caught you pretending to be a Parra fan
@andy_seags @cmw12_ @erin_molan @jessgilarte @kaitlynweldon @nrlfootyshow sure would but unfair to the other 15 teams
@nikkers4you aww being sick is never good :(
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley hopefully Moylan plays SOO so we can see how both go
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley yeah post Wallace Moylan should be in the halves. Just how patient is Dallen is the question
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn Given DWZ wants to play FB. A swap isn't on the cards?
@sandylanceley @theriffmarn or they got Maloney on real unders and need to upgrade.I think Hastings or Mitchell are the long term FB
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley if we did have $400k to spend a prop would be bought before a winger
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley same here another Eto or something maybe but not a test/SOO winger
@theriffmarn @sandylanceley surely that's just manager talk? I wouldn't think we are in the market for a winger let alone for that coin
@ccleary_ yes it is very quiet
@wallyfrogmore @andy_seags he's just upset because he misses Pantherettes this week
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore they were pricks to carry. I went the roller blade option so much better
@andy_seags @wallyfrogmore I think Paciao is a tosser
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore I was a skater...so we skaters only liked each other
@pattonmeister @wallyfrogmore I was a skater...so we only liked each other
@sweetandsoward so's mine but it's good. I hate when I am busy &amp; miss out on stuff
@pattonmeister haha. Conflicts with random stangers is always fun
@sweetandsoward Wed night is oztag night for me :D
@lukej83 @leaguefreak let them promote their sports on their shows. I hate talking about other sports on other sports
@wallyfrogmore nope. I am the same can't decide leaning towards Mayweather
@lukej83 @leaguefreak there is enough but News Limited can't promote RL...must only bag it out
@sianstevens4 @normyzee yep some monsters in the world. Meanwhile plenty can't have kids
@leaguefreak the pricks have a whole segment on Hayne later aswell... RL players galore
@sianstevens4 my mistake you said easter eggs not heaven! I am on my way to every WS woolworths
@sianstevens4 pfft half price... Kmart at Penrith has them for 50c
@cmw12_ haha. atleast it's indoors.... Oztag is freezing
@theriffmarn they have Hastings, Ferguson &amp; Mitchell. Need the cap to sign Maloney, SKD etc
@cmw12_ well the question @meccamaxima do you need a pretty blonde to be the face of Your stores?
@cmw12_ haha. that would make a good advertisement for a makeup company... Someone sign you up quick!
@amarief10 does feeling sick in the stomach when I watch Shortland street count?
@sweetandsoward well there's always a 1st time for everything
@normyzee @njc829103 well given the amount of kiwis in Bondi... That statement is correct
@sweetandsoward Idris was due back round 3 &amp; played the last trial. I think he will comeback after the rep week bye
@sharkydave44 no doubt but he is more useful off the bench then Barba. So I'd imagine a change will happen at some stage
@sweetandsoward yeah they will take their time with him coming back...sadly
@normyzee more shockingly is you actually found a Roosters fan
@amarief10 haha. I will stick to the backline in that case... No dumb forwards for me
@sweetandsoward yes it's exciting. Hopefully he has the boots on to make a shock comeback like Idris did
@sharkydave44 Depends how he goes there Over say a month. A good game is 1 thing. He should be in the 17 all yr though
@sharkydave44 assuming Bird stays at 5/8th which is no guarantee
@cmw12_ @lorealparisau if that plug doesn't earn you free makeup nothing will!
@amarief10 the mighty New York Rangers are also....doesn't mean anyone cares. Well I do
@amarief10 &amp; I pinch anything not nailed down.. But he lives in Bondi not Penrith
@njc829103 @thecraigbrown it will never be prefect but it's spreading the talent like it's meant too
@amarief10 over there maybe
@amarief10 Good he can spend it protecting his stuff from being stolen
@thecraigbrown  @njc829103 yep. Yet idiots say the cap isn't working
@sandylanceley around the 4nations time Watson spoke to him Foran &amp; someone else about moving there
@leaguefreak they will just play Hastings there
@sandylanceley the money was too good. Roosters need to upgrade others more than him
@sandylanceley Tomkins has been homesick for a while now. surprised it didn't happen for this season tbh
@Nikkers4you home time it seems
@sharkydave44 he can play in Wyong with Stapleton
@normyzee depends if RTS wants the kiwis in Bondi or actually going home
@andycee007 yep. Either party will stuff you a different way
@rugbyleaguespot @penrithpanthers 0-10 now.
@nikkers4you coffee people are use to it
@rugbyleaguespot @penrithpanthers not so sure our record backing up from a Monday night is poor. They are a dangerous team
@andycee007 nope. Sadly both screw you over
@sweetandsoward nice work!
@rugbyleaguespot @penrithpanthers yes... Miracle recovery is needed
@njc829103 @thecraigbrown exactly. They move the games there that they should move
@njc829103 @dailytelegraph @nickwalshaw @thecraigbrown neither have I. I assume Parra's shit ANZ record is behind it
@former_legend @pattonmeister Next time you lose a $6 pair of thongs....sorry NRMA $2K. You will wish you stole that policy too
@former_legend @pattonmeister or in insurance terms $10k
@uncyd nah needs to do the rest of the royal family 1st... 1 term isn't enough time
@pattonmeister atleast they play some good songs.I had that coming back from Dubbo on the wkd...Hadley or JJJ was the choice
so @dailytelegraph &amp; @smh we can't expect a backpage on the referee stuffups in the WSW game last night?
@pattonmeister I hate all that boring hipster shit they play lately
@thecraigbrown @dailytelegraph @nickwalshaw all that rag does is whinge.
@pattonmeister so did I. He had neutrals saying it was right but he didn't care...dickhead
@amarief10 if the dick we have in charge has his way. Nauru will have a better economy than us
@pattonmeister still better than Hadley..
@uncyd That's Mr single term to you
@sweetandsoward you can do it.
@sweetandsoward looks good.
@mrives76 You are using the term she very loosely
@sandylanceley @skynewsaust haha. It really is a pig of a human
@bostonnnnnn I only bet on US sports get better markets. Unless it's a GF or something
@wallyfrogmore @andy_seags What happens on grind... I mean twitter stays on twitter
@andy_seags I can think of plenty
@andy_seags @wallyfrogmore Ask me in a month...
@andy_seags If you drown...i won't give you mouth to mouth
@wallyfrogmore anymore than a month &amp; any hole is a goal...
@amarief10 they are the worst... I did mine the other week
@wallyfrogmore depends how long is the dry spell
@shannenleee1 haha. Why did that not get on the big screen...looks awesome
@njc829103 @mtweet80 @normyzee @rl_ratings @thecraigbrown yep always good to compare even if we hate the sport
@normyzee @mtweet80 @njc829103 @rl_ratings @thecraigbrown yep we need those facts in the media
@njc829103 @leaguefreak @mareeta74 @normyzee on field refs are fine. The VR is head scratcher
@juanfarkall @boozerothfield @nrl does bottles of metho go further than coke bottles?
@nikkers4you given the crap on TV...Big call
@mesa1811 @boozerothfield @cheyne_31 no let him. Then the prick will get the arse
@theriffmarn any word on the injured Moss, Davis, BMM?
@nat_sinclair93 @dannitequila yes. Everyone should be on here. Then we can have our own Panther world

#WeAreSickOfNRLNegativity
#SaveOurRefs

@newscomauHQ @telegraph_spo…
@sianstevens4 I can't read...so not me
@readingtheplay @greg_camilleri @mrives76 @pattonmeister @thenrlfixer problem is they have blocked us all
@leaguefreak I did need a safeword 
#mytombstonein5words
#MyTombstoneIn5Words
@amarief10 haha Classic! Mine would be: She said no should've listened!
@penrithpanthers @theriffmarn thanks for that. He can play the test aswell.
@penrithpanthers @sweetandsoward no Whare... Fantastic
@theriffmarn @penrithpanthers how long is Whare out for? Lets hope not long.
@mitch_j_hooper @the_red_heifer If you are like me in SC. They will be injured next week... In that case pick Pearce
@sianstevens4 Summer fruit...sounds like the stripper that took all my $1 notes in LA
@sianstevens4 haha. 1st world problems
@mtweet80 @bradwaltersmh @sandylanceley QLD delayed. Adelaide no coverage...also
@notbreerose yes my cat loves eating them most
@thecraigbrown @mtweet80 @njc829103 ban bottles being sold. More security to ensure ppl stay in their seats
@mtweet80 @njc829103 @thecraigbrown that's why point losses won't be on the cards
@nikkers4you they are so fun haha
@footy_1717 @bostonnnnnn Mansour came in despite not no pre-season. Blake's ok just new to RL was our best back last night
@andy_seags @dannitequila haha... Never heard that word before this weekend.
@normyzee @andrewvossy @foxnrl @njc829103 where will they go? The other codes are terrible
@andy_seags @dannitequila being called a chap is far better than I waa expecting
@wallyfrogmore @itsbenzi @mitch_j_hooper @nikkers4you dude they play us. Our record after Mon night games is 0-10
@mitch_j_hooper @pattonmeister so true. Last night our soft forwards &amp; wingers MIA in defence was why'we lost
@pattonmeister @mitch_j_hooper yep. Same here the VR procedure is broken but the calls were 50/50 so can't say they were wrong
@niles1991 @the_red_heifer balant errors in a season I mean. Most are 50/50 &amp; people whinge
@niles1991 @the_red_heifer I have these arguments all the time. You can count on 1 hand the balant errors in games. VR is my gripe
@andy_seags @dannitequila In that case. I will make sure you know how great the girls look
@ccleary_ haha. No that's to keep the weirdos away from real life me. I have DM photos to the normal people
@footy_1717 @bostonnnnnn so are we atm. 10 of the 17 last night either back from major injury or no pre-season will take time
@ccleary_ same the camera hates me
@andy_seags @dannitequila the question is. Are you coming the bearded one
@amarief10 we let you play us in the WC final...a favour in return is fair
@boozerothfield throwing bottles at Ashley Klein
@bostonnnnnn our record under Ivan after playing Mon night is 0-10...they are specials to win
@amarief10 can you send some of it our way?
@amarief10 haha. Hows the weather going
@amarief10 ah good. Made me think I missed something then haha
@amarief10 2012?
@mtweet80 yeah it's the reason we have so many 1 term govts lately
@amarief10 yeah too many players with no heart. Haha. Yes would of been close to the best year of your life
@rugbyleaguespot no doubt he will a great player. It's not even poor reads just not marking up &amp; that. Someone needs to talk out there
@rugbyleaguespot everytime they went right they scored.
@rugbyleaguespot I am a realist. We haven't played well this season. Too many soft tries &amp; our forwards get trampled
@mtweet80 the middle are silent so get ignored &amp; policies are made for the 20% nut jobs on the far edges
@rugbyleaguespot I had issue with the tries being over ruled on the evidence we had but they carved us in all ways last night
@njc829103 @thenrlfixer Cleary doesn't believe they were 20 points better. I suggest he watch the tape and change that comment
@rugbyleaguespot yep. It's rubbish we need to blame the poor performances
@mtweet80 so true. The far right &amp; left loonies are what is wrong with the country
@njc829103 @thenrlfixer if not on field call stands. Sadly Cleary &amp; Wallace focused more on it then our poor performance
@njc829103 @thenrlfixer same here. 12 looks is not good enough. should only be a couple of looks to see a glaring error
@sianstevens4 You care so much. Someone should give you the mother teresa medal or something
@sianstevens4 haha. Nice effort. It will warm everyone up atleast... So thoughtful of you
@mtweet80 Unions have nothing to lose or gain from it. They will stay quiet &amp; let it blow up
@sianstevens4 I don't drink coffee but have done that before. Sprayed the person in front of you?
@thenrlfixer I have no doubt they would of. It's like 2011 all over again. Young guys go well then comeback with an ego
@mtweet80 it's a disgrace. Lets hope the swinging voters act accordingly next time in the polls. Have the libs condemned it?
@thenrlfixer though that's ignoring our forwards getting belted &amp; Mansour having no idea in defence
@thenrlfixer Moylan probably didn't get it down. The ref had the best view &amp; gave it. 12 looks proves doubt. On field should of stood
@amarief10 Good choice. We won't make the 8. It's 2011 all over again
@thenrlfixer @timggilbert yep. There were 2 crazy overturns but we were shit it all facets of the game
@mtweet80 Wouldn't achieve the desired result. The media would swing it too ALP wanting distraction
@andy_seags @dannitequila well if you come this week....I will tell you exactly where to sit
@amarief10 so am I. Wake up early even when I go to bed late
@andy_seags @dannitequila ah but there is 4 30m lines....only 1 has the lovely Danni.
@pantherman45 @natetaylor87 pretty much we weren't a 20 point worse team than them. Maybe so but they out played us in every way
@sweetandsoward haha. So true... I'd much prefer the Penrith top 8 more though
@cmw12_ was to be expected given the circumstances. The next 2 will be similar...than the big ones will start
@dannitequila here I was for all these years thinking my seat on halfway was the best.... People need to be told of this!
@sweetandsoward ppl ask how you have 2 teams... You always get a team that wins atleast
@cmw12_ poor girl. was slippery out there &amp; not a big crowd to see it atleast
@dannitequila @nat_sinclair93 great photo... Btw I am so changing my seats so they are on the 30m line pre game haha
@jackdorrigo1917 @natetaylor87 as has been the case the last 5-10yrs we have 6-8k fans that always turn up
@sweetandsoward probably the only thing that could make it worse haha
@natetaylor87 @pantherman45 The comments from the coach post game don't fill me with confidence...10-11 over again
@sweetandsoward it's pouring here....lucky it's now &amp; not when the game was on
lol Ivan... That's why we will do the same things next week

#NRLPanthersCowboys
@ccleary_ it's pouring down here too
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak no doubt. Souths, Storm etc deal with it. We need to get more ruthless on &amp; off the field.
@cmw12_ glad to hear it. Who slipped as we ran out at halftime? My brother told me because I missed it
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak for me too similar to the soft tries we let in last week. 3-4 soft tries is hurting more than no attack
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak What you are describing Taylor could do.
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak Again though Soward handled that against Bulldogs. Though halves are down the list of problems we have ATM
@thecraigbrown or Capts call. Perfect example tonight. Ref called try 12 looks the VR over rules. What's doubt if it's not 12 looks
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak Yet John wad fine with Sowie. Tonight we kept going right because Wal called despite it failing
@sweetandsoward haha. I will add you to the westie list.. That puts you higher
@nrlfeeds @leaguehq1 @thecraigbrown Refs are fine. The irregularities with the VR that gets me.. It's broken
@mickyt1985 @leaguefreak Tbh better to have a fit young guy then a handbrake in the 7..Soward or no Soward Wallace is MIA
@ccleary_ She's not the only one. No excuse for that tonight
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ Haha. Well great have another westie on here
@greg_camilleri @leaguefreak We have huge problems if we think he's all we need.. A new defensive line for starters
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ I thought you lived up on the Coast aswell
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward You have the beach though
@mj_lynch @smh Standard is fine. Irregularities with VR is not
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward I live 10mins from the ground... Great after nights like this
@sweetandsoward same... Well my bed not yours
@cmw12_ I sure did... It was the best part of the night
@themattbungard @joshrobbo44 @suthodan btw I agree it's the process to get that call that's broken
@themattbungard @joshrobbo44 @suthodan if so why the 12 looks. A clear no try/try is about 4 looks..like Cootes
@themattbungard @joshrobbo44 @suthodan there's no Checcin clause in the rule book...any doubt goes with onfield call
@cmw12_ @ccleary_ haha. Good to have a postive...well 2 you didn't fall off the top
@mickyt1985 @suthodan seems we are the only 2 that think that haha
@suthodan @twileague haha. Yes I am sure I followed them at some stage
@gc_anthony 2010 we finished 2nd. Ran 12th 2011... History says we won't
@andy_seags @wallyfrogmore Yes you guys played away. A bit different to that shite tonight at home
@nepeannews @theriffmarn our only good player tonight
@sharkydave44 still he made more tackles then Mansour did tonight
@gc_anthony that's why our teams are a mid table team at best. We lack a ruthless edge on &amp; off the field
@gc_anthony @penrithpanthers no we lost 3 in arow. Not 1 player dropped despite soft tries against
@wallyfrogmore we were the worst of the round
@njc829103 @penrithpanthers look at the tries we have conceded this year. Defence is poor Soward can only fix so much
If we had a coach with balls. Mansour &amp; others get dropped. Sadly @penrithpanthers fans we have Cleary
@sharkydave44 1 of many poor calls tonight
fuck me. 12 looks is doubt. Doubt goes with the refs call
@suthodan @twileague I had this discussion....It's the reason I only follow a handful of Panthers fans...they are dicks
@leaguefreak &amp; a Mansour that can make tackles
@suthodan the rule should be video ref makes the call without a recommendation from the ref
@suthodan @twileague never said that. You seen Mansour's defence?
@suthodan it looked no try. The ball being covered means you don't see enough to over rule the ref
@gc_anthony might of been. The rules say you need to see it 100% the ref went no try
@suthodan not enough to overtune it though.... You couldn't see the ball
@nat_sinclair93 @dannitequila looking good out there girls...
How the fuck does that get overturned.
Waqa Blake you machine!
@nikkers4you mine
@amarief10 we are the same without Soward
@god30300525 @amarief10 except when you play us of course
@theriffmarn if our 4 props run 100m + we win
@njc829103 @normyzee well we can get a maxi taxi home &amp; fit the whole crowd in
@petervlang yeah been awhile coming. Outstanding player
@njc829103 @normyzee you haven't 10k friends with you. Looking bare here
@normyzee @theparraeels you want sexy number 21 for us
@theriffmarn our forwards have been weak. Idris will fix that
@sharkydave44 the moment I tipped them...upset was off
@sweetandsoward nope. But people could be at Panthers and that hopefully
@amarief10 everytime I tip you guys.... Loss is the result
@sweetandsoward field doesn't look to bad either. Good I want to see Waqa Blake on a dry field
@sweetandsoward suns out with a rainbow...that should be it for the rain :)
@joeljpienmunne1 last year had away losses to WT, Can &amp; Newcastle. They were far worse on paper. It will come
@joeljpienmunne1 something like 9 away wins in 62 games. A crazy stat
@njc829103 @normyzee btw Nicho are you at the game? This NYC ref is good.. She's hot too
@normyzee @njc829103 you guys too... The bastards always do that to us
@amarief10 they are the biggest scumbags in the game
@normyzee our NYC team is getting pumped... This chick ref should be in the top grade
@leaguefreak @sowwowofficial Sowie is a god. Everyone should bow down to him
@normyzee @njc829103 yep. Look at the players missing...add dropped ball etc far more behind it than the ref
@normyzee @theparraeels haha. Losers blaming the ref
@normyzee you guys are another 12months away from having the depth to win games regularly
With Waqa Blake playing for @penrithpanthers tonight. You will see close to the best backline to ever grace a RL field!
@amarief10 haha. Have then
@amarief10 they should of won by plenty more
@sweetandsoward nice work... No doubt you will hear me yelling at people haha
@amarief10 well you have it half right
@sweetandsoward are you making the trip down?
@sweetandsoward there was a decent turnout when the gates opened. No more rain in the next hour should get many more to come
@sweetandsoward yep stopped now. Can stay away please
@amarief10 a mistake I often make. Now it's thousand island or none
@sweetandsoward club side grey. The shopside actually sun in parts. Should be dry for kickoff
@sandylanceley good point. If the interchanges are reduced I fear this will be loophole exploited
@sweetandsoward yeah I just got here. Hopefully it passes soon so not to scare off others
@amarief10 yes some eg the steak sound great but tastes like arse
@sandylanceley yep or for foul play. Make them backup so teams don't abuse it
@wallyfrogmore @sharkydave44 haha. That makes sense
@wallyfrogmore Haha. I need that
@dannitequila Happy Easter yourself
@suthodan I love Mark Tremonti some great album tracks done with Creeds missed because Stapp's a dick
@suthodan No Alter Bridge is Creed with a better lead singer
@pattonmeister Haha. Stupid DT
@ccleary_ Footy tomorrow doesn't help
@sweetandsoward @ccleary_ Left hander rule
@suthodan Dude listen to Bullets.... Mad song. I imagine them as Alter Bridge with a better singer
@sianstevens4 @andy_seags @guywhotweetsyou @lynshields @uncyd Yet coffee says 'contents maybe hot' us stupid ppl need to know these things
@andy_seags @guywhotweetsyou @lynshields @sianstevens4 @uncyd No way. Next you will say peanut butter has peanuts in it
@kinkylou33 @notbreerose haha. You told them Louise
@kinkylou33 this is it more like it
@sianstevens4 @andy_seags @uncyd The bunny over stocked my place. Homeless guys will be eating for a month off it
@notbreerose this is the convo
@ccleary_ To see family... So boring &amp; made me hang for the game even more
@sianstevens4 @andy_seags @uncyd Haha. Sadly I know that feeling too well
@ccleary_ tell me about it. Driving back from Dubbo straight to the game
@uncyd Yep only Souths fans have fewer
@uncyd @andy_seags @sianstevens4 Yeah it's the best dessert created!
@uncyd Haha. Carnes are never been smart but this is a new stupid
Here's a tip - someone on twitter pissing you off unfollow... It's not brain surgery
@andy_seags @sianstevens4 @uncyd The only Xmas thing I eat is triffle.. By the bucket load aswell
@normyzee this is the convo. See just a normal reply
@wallyfrogmore According to some fuckwit I am... Haha
@normyzee Does anyone care is the point
@amarief10 The cheque is in the mail
@kurtismoltzen @brally I have plenty of similar general chat DM's going. I found out I was being annoying &amp; unfollowed. It was that simple
@jessgilarte It's been ages since we have been at home
@brally @kurtismoltzen Well that's what the button is there for... Far better then bitching behind Someone's back
@sianstevens4 @uncyd If you like dry rock hard cake..
@kurtismoltzen @brally I unfollowed now.. The button is there for a reason
@brally There is atleast 2 pages worth of tweets on my page between tweets to you. So clearly I reply to tweets as I see them
@uncyd @sianstevens4 They are terrible the worst food
@kurtismoltzen @brally Haha. Yes replying to stuff that appears on my TL is annoying someone.
@sianstevens4 Yes. 2nd only to Christmas cake in worst holiday foods!
@brally They need a Tv &amp; hobby I think
@thecraigbrown @njc829103 @sandylanceley Did you see Holmes break? Runs like that are behind Gordon
@juanfarkall @wallyfrogmore Ah easy mistake to make latte usually means Roosters fans
@sharkydave44 Fifita off the bench. Heighinhton is the start or don't play type player
@amarief10 I will buy the pay per view
@juanfarkall @wallyfrogmore 4 roosters fans is pushing it
@amarief10 You forgot coke head aswell
@amarief10 Yeah series 6 is pretty average
@pattonmeister @sharkydave44 @skeksis_ Barba is a long term project a backrow of Graham, Bird, Lewis helps him ease into the role
@ccleary_ @sweetandsoward Been too long without footy
@brally @vividsydney I never been. You can keep that &amp; tea
@sharkydave44 @pattonmeister @skeksis_ Gallen prop. Bird lock problem solved
@amarief10 Yes living in NZ is
@normyzee @njc829103 yep. Refs were pretty good today
@amarief10 Ok I will tell him tomorrow
@amarief10 I tipped them hardly a miracle... They haven't been too bad
@sweetandsoward I tipped Sharks this had been coming a while this performance
@pattonmeister I said you guys would win. This is a far better looking side
@nikkers4you Beer fixes all
@nikkers4you Haha. Just say you are hot enough without professional photos
@suthodan Must have some incriminating photos of someone
@suthodan Haha so Flanno can not play them?
@nikkers4you Nice. Mine was Offspring... I still have the same one as well
@amarief10 Punch on...I'd pay to see that
@thenrlfixer @njc829103 @thecraigbrown Unless Bulldogs refuse to ban can't be blamed. Blanket rule not bottles at NRL games like Parra has
@amarief10 Yeah Bill Murray is so funny
@njc829103 @buzzrothfield @foxsportsnews @thecraigbrown yeah won't happen. Bulldogs have been helpful so can't be docked imo
@amarief10 I haven't seen that for ages... Under rated movie
@nikkers4you Nothing worse then getting sick on a weekend
@sweetandsoward Yes I will enjoy that extra hour
@juanfarkall @uncyd @wallyfrogmore Any teacher that does that should be reported to DOCS
@juanfarkall @uncyd @wallyfrogmore Nope. Sports don't reward missing &amp; dropping the ball It's a hobby
@uncyd @wallyfrogmore I can't think of a worst sport
@juanfarkall @twileague @uncyd We sell plenty of stickers &amp; keyrings.... Just not bums on seats
@maddog_nospace @twileague @uncyd Elgey is staying but Sezar/Hodkinson is handy
@juanfarkall @twileague @uncyd A feeling I know too well... We only have a crowd due to smoking hot cheer girls
@wallyfrogmore Yes the freaks can't handle you speaking the truth about that shit
@juanfarkall @wallyfrogmore Yes I watched it. Would give her a good go
@brally Yes it's a great movie
@pattonmeister Intense but fair on the field... Far better then the grubs around
@sweetandsoward the changes that are rumoured makes us stronger
@pattonmeister Sensational &amp; AFL don't go together
@sweetandsoward The dragons were certainties
@sweetandsoward Panthers turn on Monday
@notbreerose @misshunter10 Cmon be fair they only opened their page on 24 Oct. Its only just started
@notbreerose She forgets her name when I am finished with her... So not her fault
@thecraigbrown @donnsta1 @juanfarkall @normyzee Her &amp; yep sure do
@nikkers4you An eyeball?
@sandylanceley @thecraigbrown What's the capacity there? Also remember it was only announced 4 weeks ago
@sianstevens4 @sandylanceley Yep PC garbage pisses me off
@normyzee @donnsta1 @juanfarkall @thecraigbrown My ex is like that. She's a nutter rarely sees mine
@normyzee @matt_schoey @sianstevens4 I was going to say that. Given I am a perve I can't call others the same
@sianstevens4 @matt_schoey He doesn't follow me either...troll
@njc829103 @thecraigbrown 6.2k
@thecraigbrown Not sure what it holds but for the population it's a decent turn out
@sianstevens4 Yep. It's Easter piss up &amp; have fun... Not whinge
@thecraigbrown Yep but matched what it would of got at Manly
@sianstevens4 So true people bang on about so meaningless shit
@amarief10 You can have them..
@amarief10 yes no doubt about it
@jessgilarte I get plenty annoyed at the games more then I should really. Never have I thought to do anything like that. It's just a game
@jessgilarte Ruined an otherwise great game
@jonoredv @andy_seags @m_b_d_s @wallyfrogmore I will ask her later
@jessgilarte Yes. It's s disgraceful thing to do. Hopefully they are found &amp; dealt with
