Those kinda characters are so relatable cuz all I do is lean on things looking standoffish but a little sad and not listen to anyone
I love being a brooding brunette male lead in a shitty movie directed @ young adults
do u ever just enter the bathroom, lock the door, stare mournfully @ urself for a few minutes, wash ur hands and leave
@courfeywreck I have an autopsy meeting with some really cool scientists tomorrow and I forgot so now I'm not ready and can't go lmao

WOW FUCK THAT ENDING
"I can't be saved."

This fic is fucking me up I love it
"I would rather have you," 
@enjolrah oh my god I'm finding that immediately
@enjolrah was it under my wings you will find refuge bc fave but also Unfinished Hell
its cool idk. i like that things arent just interchangeable cause it can seem that way sometimes.
but back in the spn days that kind of thing was not only par for the course but set in canon like,,
like there wont Be a les mis fic where, for example, enjolras is cursed to only speak in britney spears lyrics. or emoticons.
@enjolrah tbh!!! im always like "i want les mis curse fic" but then thinking on it it wouldnt rly work as well i guess? like. aaaaa
i dont read much txf fic cause what i read often has this like staunch, stiff vibe. like its still until it hurts &amp; usually canon or ooc
its pretty much entirely "what if they werent singers and met some other way," very casual, fun and happy aus.
les mis like? its all reincarnation. and it has a chiller, less canon-adherent vibe. while w/ 1d from what ive read its pretty much liek
spn was Always its a ridiculous curse, or undercover married, but like there were so many bizarre hilarious curse fics it was the norm
its weird how each fanbase has its own set of fic tropes? like, idk, the Vibe of every fanbases fic is so different
@lluciens *chanting* start it start it join me in hell i want more texting aus
rec me fic i'm surviving off of the larry novel-sized one rn and its good but i can only take so much at a time

currently: leaning coolly against a wall and texting with 3 other students and a teacher, who is also leaning coolly against a wall texting
I'm turning into actual garage band garbage by mistake? My music taste is too broad I'm getting into lo-fi trash

salted butter n shit in a pan,,, fry up some bread,,,,, scramble some eggs n cheese n cream cheese,,, stick it on top,,,,,, ace

@courfeywreck go get food
@webkinzgoth omfg i dont remember her bf i just remember her being good @ shifting, but tbh have u seen the tv series bc its. so good
literally every animorph was so good and the books introduced me 2 new concepts like crying without blinking and conservation of mass
@webkinzgoth cassie was up there in my faves too? wtf i loved them all individually
@webkinzgoth he was the one who was like always trying to be funny bc he was scared shitless i have no idea if his mom was a yeerk
@webkinzgoth i know what the fuck? what the fuck? animorphs was so good but fucked me up? evry1 hated marco but i liked him
@webkinzgoth :/ no promises,,, tobias was kind of the coolest
i'd actually rather be an animorph? i think i could be really good in fights as a hawk or something
i just really want to ride into just battle on a tiger
@courfeywreck @webkinzgoth i do live by a zoo and multiple aquariums i can probably grab a shark and some tigers

Me drawing eyeliner: draws a line down @ the corner, draws another line to make it a triangle, slathers liner until it's filled in
@webkinzgoth the curve of ur lower lashes and starting at the tip of the wing, then like drawing the triangle if that makes sense??
@webkinzgoth hooded eyes are Fine w eyeliner tbh and also yeah u just have to try a few different methods I think tbh? I like like, followin
I tried to find more mixes with like screaming and generally terrible music but it was all riot grrrl shit and I'm cringing
*remembers garage band au playlist* aHa
@webkinzgoth yeah Fuck Pencils,, but tbh otherwise it's just like. Lots of methods don't work 4 different eyes tbh
@webkinzgoth what have u been using? Like a pencil or gel or liquid? Pencils are shit imo
I'm always asking "wanna go to ihop" but not once has someone said yes and gone is it rly that unrealistic
Bad Ideas and Good Ideas all blend together so easily

@montpamasse @lluciens convos don't have a time limit technically I cld pick it up again now and it'd still count
definitely had dreams involving kitten, Austria, and large dogs (woohoo fears) but it was like I'd had if before so I kept skipping scenes
@lluciens @montpamasse I refute both of these claims on the grounds of I've talked to u both one on one abd it's a good time
The curse of the randomly chosen camera image strikes a again

[My Twt Report] via 
@courfeywreck &gt;:D
im listening to coldplay bc i hate myself and love to live in the past
affect is the action effect is the result
@courfeywreck I ASSUMED IT WAS TYPO&lt;&lt;,, W O W,,,,, the effect, to affect, it affects, the effects
@courfeywreck smfgh,,, true,,, thank u
i'm being too talky abt it because i kind of want someone to tell me im being an asshole or something talking abt it makes me unnerved
idk its just My Opinion that ppl who arent same-gender attracted shldnt be using queer in regards to themself considering its history! sorry
Sry For Being A Huge Bitch rip
like if my ace het friend calls themself queer im just gonna :/ and move on its not. its whatever idk i feel like Mean for talking abt it?
Sry For Being So Controversial in me opinions [shrug emote] it rly doesnt impact how i interact w ppl much
"queer came to be deployed pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late-19th century" sums it up 4 me
i mean 
@courfeywreck i'm not like the Dictator on who can use it i just think when heteroromantic or heterosexual ppl use it it's iffy
@courfeywreck no i mean you can bc it applies to you, but like, thers ppl in the lgbtqia+ who queer isnt used against, so

It's a really great opportunity to admire traits so often looked over or down on and I adore it
I love characters becoming beautiful under the hands of those who love them tbh!!! Even if society or whatever wouldn't think so
Like the broken nose and crooked teeth and bags under eyes and shit, u know? Things that become attractive with the character
Yeah Some fans might make them conventionally attractive but I really love the idea of someone not conventionally attractive becoming so

@lluciens experience or a shared thing its like repeatedly judging people based on how a str8 person things gay ppl act
@lluciens they mean they like think they can just Tell when someone is gay because of how they look or something? like its not a shared
@lluciens i think its cause for me a gaydar means recognizing the like subtle things i do as a gay in others, but when a str8 person says it
@lluciens i wld have to see a little more of ur cat nyx
but anyway,,, Right Again,,,, imo,,,
its not creepy its like cuz u can recognize the experiences and actions in urself right? str8 ppl who think they have one are wrong

@irlprincessluna hahaha, thought so. i'll leave it out.

is "i like video games, board games, drinking games," inappropriate or do u think they'll let it slide
@irlprincessluna TRUE.. ALL VERY TRUE PERFECT i'll be sure to apply with this immediately
do u think "really into social justice" is code enough for "fellow gays join me"
can my parents see this application bc theres quite a few things i wld say if they cannot

@courfeywreck So you're just going to reply jokingly and totally ignore the issue? Okay. Typical gay. :/
(please make isaac take back the dare. please)
@realdanascully how would you feel if i said no one gives a shit about your gay dare? i bought a rainbow backpack for you guys
@realdanascully i, as a straight person, feel really ostracized and excluded :( you all really hurt my feelings when ur mean to heteros
okay ive been holding this in for a while. you guys all are great and ive been trying to ignore it but its really making me uncomfortable ok

@courfeywreck stop making me feel like being straight is bad. i get it that gays go through a lot but i do too. its hard being straight in t

@webkinzgoth I can't cuz he's a fire spinner and I don't fuck w/ them while their spinning
The latest John Oliver thing is about the test we opted out of / didn't take 100% &gt;:) a local skool is on it

I'm kind of waiting to wake up, which is stupid, cause it's been a long time and bad things still happen? But like.... God. God!
It doesn't feel "good" it feels like a fuxking relief when I remember how out of options and miserable I was like literally how is this real
But like I literally can't even believe this is still happening like I think I've been in shock for two years
Like I really. It's so testament to how life can change at any time and sometimes in really big really huge really good ways
I love it here I can't believe this place is real. I love nova so much like I really could not fathom this two years ago

@courfeywreck @montpamasse THEY HAVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT ACCENTS yall are so strange
like i ccan say based on Multiple meetings he has always been very pleasant and kind and genuine. but i still dont like him
i'm glad we all feel apathetic to negatively about this guy
i'm not any less embarrassed about it all but i cant stop telling everyone
a few days ago whatever seive usually fits between my brain and my mouth and keeps the worst garbage from spilling out totally malfuntioned
THE A TEAM USED TO REMIND ME OF END!VERSE SO BAD LFMOFMOFOOAAOA
plus no offense but 18 is not the best song on that album by a long shot
ed is a nice guy but i wont be 100% with him unless he apologizes for talking rudely abt zayn lmao he can fuk himself for now
@montpamasse @courfeywreck listen this is th one ed wrote 
@fuckingwrecker @montpamasse it represents your request for 1 (one) D (dana)
@montpamasse i know what you mean,, europeans all sound exactly the same
@montpamasse UR THINKING OF THINKING OUT LOUD BY ED SHEERAN
@courfeywreck @montpamasse yeah like. using landlines? shit's weird
@montpamasse THAT FS ED SHEERAN YOU DINGUS he writes some of their songs and they (were?) friends but oh myg do
@montpamasse this si exactly what i want in my life
its like ur a fossil sample.... and im an impatient paleontologist.... cause i wanna date you badly
listening to why i cry, yet again, because i'm fuckign garbage,
i told myself "dont. listening to it once is one thing, twice is another, but three times in two days is too much." but here i am,
@webkinzgoth omg yea hopefully in a functional way this time, give me a min 2 get water n put these roses somewhere Else
@courfeywreck its perfect i love it
@montpamasse really stressful gardening show?
@courfeywreck the pity party is Very appreciated, I was going to have to do some serious pouting otherwise
What's with the roses though why would anyone buy me roses
I also remember something about a donut and coffee and there's a bag here but no mug or anything
I have spent this day in a pain haze and I am Sick Of It like there's roses on my bed and I vaguely remember groaning about them
Rip sorry I'm testy bc I am in Pain and what's better than this being extra snappish bc of other issues
I'm just bitter cuz it doesn't match up w my headcanons but ugh! Like do u need to jar me out of it every 2 seconds why r u so obsessed w it
This fic wld be gr8 if they didn't keep reminding me how fuxking white this author headcanons everyone! "Ghostly" "snowlike" "milky" stop!
@fuckingwrecker like if ur seeing a wrestling champ and describing them as skinny scrawny and sickly pale u need to take a step back
@fuckingwrecker TRU but when every character is "milk-white" and "scrawny" and "pallid" it's like Stop this is so excessive
Like whatever do what u want but <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
Idk maybe it's just me but I hate "scrawny" grantaire so much!!!! He's not a cave dweller imo and like he likes boxing and fencing and shit
Like no offense but skinny-pale-boy is so fucking tired like please I'm so bored of these awful descriptors it's 2015
literally why is white grantaire so common in fics when I see it so rarely in fanart
@courfeywreck ON KIK?? dang i need to find my phone already and omfg Fantastic tho i cant wait to read
like when im tired its very easy and nice to be able to not provide that much hard thought and instead just offer quips and praise tbh
i love talking to people who make it easy for me to reflect back and to compliment casually and have it be a conversation
@fuckingwrecker I don't know what you're implying. All the love. x
me and harry styles have the same favorite dessert flavor im so proud of him (its chocolate hazelnut)
im gonna go on mobile to lay my weary eyes to rest
@gashmouth rip [nonexistent hug emoji] feel free to hmu on kik if u wanna talk abt it
standards"
i think it used to mean "failing at one thing can be succeeding at a lesser thing" but now i'd rather say "dont hold urself to irrelevant
an ugly butterfly is a beautiful slug or something. im not even sure that's right anymore. or what it means. but thers you have it
n idk what that even means but it was a personal mantra for like age 4-7
but then i thought abt how if it was a slug it would be quite beautiful bc it had these little pink streaks on it from the wings
i had this butterfly pin and the wings broke off. and i thought wow this butterfly would be considered super ugly by other butterflies
actually a weird thought i used to have A Lot as a kid like a very small child was about a butterfly and a slug? i thought like.
@Harry_Styles thanks for the update harry
instead of being a poor imitation of this thing the option to be a great version of this other thing i actually felt like being was so good
like Gross! gross. tht is not me. u know when kstew (smh) cut her hair and everyone was like Oh
whatever shitty weaponized femininity Girl everyone tried 2 make me?
but then i realized like i dont have to be that? and it was like wow i am so much more beautiful and perfect when i stop trying to be like
i spent soooo logn thinking i was like Ugly bc i hated how i looked in red lipstick and dresses and shit
y i k e s my internet just totally died
@webkinzgoth FUCK! TBH!
i have a fun time playing video games and by that i mean i get stuck in the floor and drown on land while evryone else laughs to 80s music
@courfeywreck too quiet,,,,, maybe everyone is running that heist
@webkinzgoth oh my god.. Casual
this was the only one i saved but the rest of the tiem it was just Dark and Water and Swimming in Air @webkinzgoth 
-my fave things abt the mlp figurines was the different shape shines in their eyes i loved it but i think i only had one or two of them
@irlprincessluna right?? she was adorable
-that fucking barbie spy game was scary as shit and i cldnt get past the royal garden part
-barbie horse adventures was so glitchy and good
things ive just remembered:
-my fav pony i owned was sew-sew but my fave pony from the VHS tapes we had was minty (shes still my fave)
@courfeywreck @montpamasse WOW XANT BELIEBE I MISSED THE START OF THIS ARGUMENT turtlenecks are so good if they're the right kind?
@webkinzgoth 
@wienersoldier [hug emoji x2 cuz im not on mobile but u get the idea]
im talking abt my mom its just so rehearsed and like shes reading a cue card and its Nice but it makes me feel ashamed for some reason
i hate insincere thank-you's as i leave the room bc i cant be mad cuz its an effort to be nice but on the inside they tick me off
@webkinzgoth Yes it's a game that was just announced like last night and it's adorable and I love it I'm so excited 4 a platformer
@webkinzgoth yes one sec
@webkinzgoth DUDE........ we're literally yooka and laylee

@courfeywreck PROBABLY NOT FAR OFF..
havent played a game *in a while smh ! my fingers, finging all over today!
like i havent played a game that didnt have some realism or Gritty or Moral Dilemma aspect and those are good but this is just. Fun
GOD im sorry i cant stop talking abt it but Yooka-Laylee is so like geared towards genuine fun and i like. aaa!! the soundtrack bits r so&lt;3
i think the only time ive suffered thru mobile youtube was for thanks for the venom and even then i was getting twitchy by the end tbh
@courfeywreck LISTNE...
me @ zayn 
@courfeywreck oh boy if ur on a device where u cant have it play in another tab then fuk it tbh i cant stand waiting like that either
@courfeywreck Good Luck also heres another one 
making playlists of the songs ppl send to you is just. u can listen to it later and its. such an unreal but good experience. try it tbh !
i think that whole "send me a song that reminds u of me and ill make a playlist" thing is a great idea like.. i kinda said it earlier like.
(ok i say fight but i mean argue for the sake of good content)
i'm gonna go fite my mom abt her workplace bc i am her business groups only connection to the not-old world
@courfeywreck 
@courfeywreck Good i Love being pissed but also tbh it's hard to find sad music that isn't Too Sad and like Slow
THIS IS MY OLD HS..... My current one has 47% heterosexual and look at my old one oh my god I'm so glad I'm gone 
@webkinzgoth yes but I'm out atm rip
@webkinzgoth is it story based or does it have like gameplay omg it sounds amazing
@FerrePls awesome I think we're clear then omg.. Yea my sister and I are out driving so I wasn't sure rip
@FerrePls oh shit I forgot, is there any traffic disruptions do u know
@FerrePls [fall out boy voice] set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late
Blaze
Plus like you know how I have that lizard oc and that vampire oc w my friend. Just saying
Yookas eyes r so gender I'm so !!! Abt red eyeliner or eyelids at all times and Laylee is fuxking adorable w/ her nose and teeth
@FerrePls holy shit? I'm so sorry
And it's like. The design for Laylee is so not typically feminine and Yooka has feminine features they're both gender as hell
I've said it before Any game with flying has me already and this has like my two favorite animals and is semi-open world and it's Pretty!
I'm so excited abt Yooka-Laylee bc a) CHARACTER DESIGN and b) GAME WITH CHAMELEON *AND* BAT and c) COLORS! SOUNDTRACK! GAMEPLAY!
I just backed Yooka-Laylee - A 3D Platformer Rare-vival! on @Kickstarter 
@wienersoldier it's all good dude if u don't wanna get into specifics on ur tl u can always like kik me too
@courfeywreck take it with a grain of salt, Zayn could blow a raspberry into a microphone and I'd call it musically historic
@courfeywreck I will tell u zayns part is truly ideal but the rest is a little poppy
@courfeywreck u know what.....fair
@realdanascully context is, as always, emo playlist
"Wow this is like really emo" -my sister, who had a serious screamo phase once
@courfeywreck NO ISAAC...... Please it's good. U monster. Self love is indulging in 1d unashamedly
@courfeywreck I would definitely make fun of myself but at the same time it wouldn't cost me anything and my sister would go
@courfeywreck ITS LIFE CHANGING
Like I laughed but now I'm thinking Could that be fun? Could that actually be a hilarious and good time
So if hypothetically if I had the option, would it be awful to go to an all time low concert, if hypothetically I'm laughing about it rly ha
*makes the mistake of listening to emo playlist w/ sister* *we are both singing to love like war and shame shall not be found here*
@courfeywreck so on the topic of emo playlist have you ever listened to 1ds cover of teenage dirtbag
@courfeywreck aww I appreciate the support. Perhaps I will share it l8r,, perhaps not
@courfeywreck our usual framerate is 12fps so 100 frames is actually like less than 10 seconds but I'm using music so I'm doing like 300?why
@courfeywreck ITS A LOT.... It's less if you just don't care abt ur mistakes but I keep trying to do a full teams work on my own lmfdmmao
I could make a 30 second interesting story with 100 frames Or I could detail the movement in a single 10 second scene forever
I feel like I've been animating for Years but I only have Twenty One Frames and I need 100 @ god help I'm gonna do so many inbetweens
@webkinzgoth SAME FCK I have such a hatred for clay and pottery and I haven't tried like marble but I'm sure I'd suck at it too
LRT I HATE MOMS
My old school was like 99% het and so ppl were like "being gay is uncommon and a defect ig" but here it's 47% het and I'm so much happier
There's a literal straight minority @ our school according to the youth survey n I'm willing to bet some answered str8 as a joke
Teach: Did u just say 'I see a gay'?
St: Ya lol
T: That's not exactly uncommon here. That's like going to a zoo and saying 'I see an animal'
@courfeywreck I'm scared I can't wait.. I'm like 2 behind too
And a guy busted out a long high D and then said "how loud am I right now, it's kinda hard to tell with headphones in"
I've been in class like 5 minutes and we've auctioned off a giant pinboard I'm liberating later for 6000 dollars
So honestly I'm a little concerned
Three times
That means I slept through Act My Age 
Good morning, I'm fuxking tired and my alarms did Nothing
god i need to sleep. okay. friday today. \m/ &lt;3 \m/ talk to u all in 6 or so hours!! animatin tomorrow

@courfeywreck OMFG??
@courfeywreck omg what is it? i only play this cuz of my science teacher like 4 yrs ago and its spread from that class
me, starting a tweet: its kind of not great
me, end of same tweet: it's great
its kind of not a great game but remembering to say it is such a successful feeling and ppl will be like "SHIT!" its great
like u "get" ppl by saying white rabbit to them before they can say it to u, and it resets midnight the first of each new month
in case u arent playing white rabbit already here's how u play:
every new month u have to be the first to say white rabbit 2 ur friends
@grantairs isaac was 75
oh shit happy may! 
ursa minor is so cute
@courfeywreck TRU.... like i cant help it if i'm beautiful sometimes?
@realdanascully does this make me some low level trash boy
i think i actually downloaded snapchat for the original purpose of exchanging platonic half-dressed pics bc we looked cute w my bestie
plus, snapchat is a little more terrifying to open in public now
if i'm gonna admire the shit out of myself for an hour i might as well share w/ someone who will send me Praise its all preening
@courfeywreck @grantairs YOU DONT KNOW WHAT UR MISSING R
@courfeywreck sometimes u just gotta share ur beauty w/ ur bff (my friend started it and we've been pals like 10 yrs ok)
@courfeywreck THE ANSWER IS YES but u gotta b careful abt what u use to send them? me and my friend have used snapchat but its shady sometim
[evil cackling abt what this means for my moms workplace] 

[remembers i do not care abt their success n goes back 2 tears]

can i play piano without crying? that is another question
the only piano i can play now is fur elise (it was my last song) and part of clair de lune (a friend taught me, unintentionally)
of all instruments i kind of miss oboe cuz i like when u have to breathe life into ur instrument as well as move ur fingers u know?
@FerrePls i had to do Lung Training which ive come to suspect was bullshit but god yeah ive broken many a reed in my lifetime
piano, oboe, and bass are all skills i dont consider myself capable of anymore and its weird i ever could do it like. fast? and well? at all
it's really bizarre to me that i was a band kid. like, ever. like that i could play an instrument, coherently, multiple times in my life
holy shit there was apparently a Thousand people at each of these squaredances. theres only like 100 ppl at my school daily
oh thank god i was so camera shy

@webkinzgoth NO WHAT PLEASE TELL ME
@webkinzgoth n o it was embarrassing and specific i'll sum it up here tho:
i love to mercilessly project my gender feelings onto fictional c
@webkinzgoth i literally just typed out like One Headcanon but it was super train of thought and apparently too much for kik
@montpamasse the harder they ball the harder they fall
my thoughts are run on sentences kik cannot fathom into 2048 characters 
@montpamasse brother bear is watchign
*slams stockings on table* gender
i cant see grantaire with like Perfect Pointy liner honestly i feel more like smudgey 2007-esque liner is incredibe
re: grantaire w/ eyeliner what if like his dark circles arent dark circles its just bc hes constantly rubbing his eyes and smudging it
@enjolrah @FerrePls did isaac sing adele and i missed it??
enjolras: something must be done, or-
grantaire: [ominous guitar chord]
it is so much the ideal obnoxious/impressive combo
plus it's attention grabbing and ppl will shush you if you try to talk over it
grantaire constantly having a guitar and using it to mysteriously announce his presence w/ a tune is so good
@webkinzgoth next up: i know how to make molotov an dim going to fight the sharks

But @webkinzgoth's eyes were careful.
Their dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on their flawless lips. In case u missed @webkinzgoth's last selfies I'm transcribing
