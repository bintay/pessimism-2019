@Optimistic_Gon Hancock stretches her lips into a little smile. "Good."
@OnePieceFreak "I.. I'm fine!" As she closes her eyes and blushes more.
@OnePieceFreak "Luffy!!!" Hancock blushes hardly and falls down.
@Optimistic_Gon Hancock nods a little as she looks at you. "That dish is Luffy's favorite. I hope you like it too."
"Oooow my poor eyes!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Call me hebihime-sama! You are not allowed to call my name even though you're using -sama in it." explained her.
@OnePieceFreak "Happy birthday, Luffy!"

@Optimistic_Gon "No. Silly. It is because I'm beautiful!" 
@GumGumBlueHero Hancock takes her mineral water and moisten your wound with it before she put the band aid to your knee.

@LazyKuzan "I can judge anyone anything like I want! And it doesnt look cute at all!"
@GumGumBlueHero Actually Hancock also doesnt understand with such marriage things. She just talked haphazardly. "Sure!"
@LazyKuzan "That is a big penguin!!" Hancock stares at it. The Penguin stares back. "Not cute at all."
@GumGumBlueHero "L.. Luffy!" She blushes harder. "You hugged me again! D.. does it mean, I will be your wife!?"
@GumGumBlueHero "I understand! I promise I will give you the most delicious food in this entire world Luffy!"

@TheMetallicNeko "I just hate men. Is that clear?"
@TheMetallicNeko "Huh. Whatever, but I dont care. I'm sitting now."
@GumGumBlueHero "I.. It's a thing you have to do for a marriage Luffy!" She blushes even more.
@TheMetallicNeko "and why?" She raises an eyebrow.
@TheMetallicNeko The pirate empress puts both of her hands to her waist. "Is it so important to you to know?"
@TheMetallicNeko "What?"
@LazyKuzan "DONT SCREAM AT ME!" 
@GumGumBlueHero Hancock looks away blushing. "I.. if you say so, does it mean a.. a proposal!?"

@NaniteSenpai "Fufufu what do you mean with  'another level'? Does it mean that you can't reach that level because you are a weak?"
@SeductiveSaya  "Don't be that sad, Kisaragi." Hancock sits on her throne. "If you want, I will let you stay here in Amazon Lily."
@NaniteSenpai "Bastard!" "Stop, Marguerite!" Hancock shouts her name and still looking at you. "You are so confident. Hm, why?"
@SeductiveSaya "Adopt?" She raises an eyebrow. "I only have two sister in my life and it's enough. I don't need any."
@NaniteSenpai "Hm!?" She raises an eyebrow when heard you calling her name. "Little punk! Call her hebihime-sama!" screamed Marguerite.
