@OnePieceFreak "I.. I'm fine!" As she closes her eyes and blushes more.
@OnePieceFreak "Luffy!!!" Hancock blushes hardly and falls down.
@Optimistic_Gon Hancock nods a little as she looks at you. "That dish is Luffy's favorite. I hope you like it too."
"Oooow my poor eyes!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Call me hebihime-sama! You are not allowed to call my name even though you're using -sama in it." explained her.

@GumGumBlueHero "I.. It's a thing you have to do for a marriage Luffy!" She blushes even more.
@TheMetallicNeko "and why?" She raises an eyebrow.
@TheMetallicNeko The pirate empress puts both of her hands to her waist. "Is it so important to you to know?"
@TheMetallicNeko "What?"
@LazyKuzan "DONT SCREAM AT ME!" 
@GumGumBlueHero Hancock looks away blushing. "I.. if you say so, does it mean a.. a proposal!?"

@NaniteSenpai "Fufufu what do you mean with  'another level'? Does it mean that you can't reach that level because you are a weak?"
@SeductiveSaya  "Don't be that sad, Kisaragi." Hancock sits on her throne. "If you want, I will let you stay here in Amazon Lily."
@NaniteSenpai "Bastard!" "Stop, Marguerite!" Hancock shouts her name and still looking at you. "You are so confident. Hm, why?"
@SeductiveSaya "Adopt?" She raises an eyebrow. "I only have two sister in my life and it's enough. I don't need any."
@NaniteSenpai "Hm!?" She raises an eyebrow when heard you calling her name. "Little punk! Call her hebihime-sama!" screamed Marguerite.
