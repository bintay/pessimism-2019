@daniel_9517 @Phaetonv2 hahah haven't listened in ages!
Arsenal always leaky at the back
"As ever against Barcelona, there are opportunities to counter- oh... "
They've made that look ridiculously easy
Well.
JAAAAAAAA
*Line-up even. Man. Just would be nice to have new players. Feels so stagnant
Changes to the batting order would at least make the upcoming Tests v New Zealand and Australia bearable
Idk anything about county cricket but there's probably someone knocking around who could fill in at number 3/4?
He's been a brilliant batsman, but things are so bad with English Test cricket, would be encouraging to see the 'future' get opportunities
Drop Ian Bell imo
But then again, lost 3-1 at home to Monaco
8 wins, 1 draw in the last 9 Premier League matches is pretty great.
Ffs, we're going to finish fourth
Yaya Toure for Paul Pogba is the kinda TopTrump deal you'd pull on your younger cousins
@andi_thomas @YICETOR "KLOPPY SECONDS: Liverpool sign Khedira after Chelsea turn him down"
@daniel_9517 @Phaetonv2 love the ending, big up Calico
@daniel_9517 @Phaetonv2 ffs the air horns <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JmeBBK ah man, I think I must've walked right past you outside Spitalfields Market? Gutted
@ARajakanthan hahah ffs
@shivamLM Daddy Day Care?
Ai se tu pego
@DanTheDazzler yeah totally, strange determination to see it through. Sacking Pietersen was such an over-reaction and probably caused this!
Cook dropped, KP to face first ball of Ashes 2015
@DanTheDazzler off his career and life!
@DanTheDazzler I think Cook should've stepped down ages ago, maybe take a break from cricket and just relax? Idk. This would've taken years
@DanTheDazzler Yeah I agree. No reason for him to come back, no reason to stay on post World Cup
Strauss gonna recall Pietersen by midday tomorrow
@DanTheDazzler yeah but they call the ECB out, unlike Knight, but tbf I was just joking. He comes across as a tool on Sky
Nick Knight, always bucking the trend


Ffs Leicester staying up
@Regista_Michael exactly! I want to buy a lot but with the good badge!
Can't do anything right ffs
Ffs can we have the good badge back? @ACMilan
Goodness me, losing Toni Kroos would be devastating for Real Madrid
I don't want to get carried away but recently, more positive news has been heading out of Sri Lanka.
Anyway, those are just hopeful, optimistic opinions I formed off the back of reading like 4 articles. IDK what's going on in Sri Lanka...
And, it would seem that Sri Lanka is slowly becoming more democratic.

Then again, at least somebody important actually visited Sri Lanka
Difficult to judge how positive that visit was, as it seems like Human Rights Inquiries are discreetly being left for SL to conduct with UN
Positive news?: US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Sri Lanka last weekend - first visit in over a decade. 
@j_hussain He's tweeting about running into a 'discourteous' immigration officer haha
Lmao, doesn't matter if you're Kumar Sangakkara, immigration has no chill! Damn.
"Before travelling to SL in 2013 for Commonwealth summit, Abbott said he was ‚Äúnot inclined to go overseas &amp; give other countries lectures‚Äù.
"Aus silent on alleged human rights abuses in SL in exchange for cooperation in cracking down on people-smuggling" 
Man, Australia is awful 
And who are we to disagree with a man like Graeme Smith?
Graeme Smith thinks Strauss would be the wrong man for England. 
@Ragulator And while both are great, and Root, Ballance, Cook(!) are undroppable, I feel like dropping Bell would be beneficial for future
@Ragulator Maybe you're right, but I thought Rashid wasn't chosen because of Ali. And because of Ali, Buttler has to drop down the order
@Ragulator Moores has been a complete disaster this time round
@DanTheDazzler not even Obama could save us
Really feels like Cook should've stepped down by now, even if only temporarily
@DanTheDazzler Lmao, one and the same
@Ragulator And the batting line up goes on forever at the expense of any decent bowling
@Ragulator I don't understand bringing Moores back, sacking Moores, bringing in Strauss (who may be too familiar, may be ace idk)
What a clown
Yeah, if you take away the 5-0 whitewash in Australia, and the 1-0 series defeat at home to SL, it's really not that bad!
Last 7 Test matches: P7 W4 D1 L2.
Last 12 months: P15 W4 D3 L8
Graeme Swann, "...excellent Test record that England have had over the last 12 months, sorry, last 7 Test matches"
English Test cricket is a shambles
@judeinlondon 
Lol Giles Coren been hacked?

Pellegrini saying City can close that gap within 5 years might be realistic, but I can't imagine it'd warm him to the board
Unfair to directly compare last two RTs but, interesting how LvG can be frank, while Pellegrini must be careful (normally)

@Phaetonv2 I hope not! It's jokes! And Hov used it best
@Phaetonv2 just realised it's probably homophobic. Ah damn.
@Phaetonv2 hahah! Man, ....boys is one of the best insults going
@Phaetonv2 how about -boys?
Highlight of Peter Moores' tenure will always be poaching Sri Lanka's World T20 winning coach, then losing home Test, ODI &amp; T20 series to SL

Oh wow, ECB chose a great day to bury news of Moores' sacking!
Lolol ridiculous rough patch outside off and that yeah, but haven't seen much turn in a while
Remember when spinners spun the ball? 

 
Howling! Hahaha
@kaossm @ARajakanthan OMG HAHAH
@AdamYV oh right yeah, sorry I thought maybe SNP/Labour coalition scared people into voting Conservative
@AdamYV read a lot about how perhaps negative media image might sway voters against Miliband
@AdamYV I don't know much, so please go on
@Alex_Wage idk much but this was interesting 
@Alex_Wage exactly
@Alex_Wage yeah, sure, I get that - but idk why those same people would then vote for Conservatives?
@Alex_Wage I'm a bit lost haha
@NudeEspresso wow! Finally! That's amazing!
@Alex_Wage is that a pun or?
@Alex_Wage haha, maybe that was a mix of lack of faith in Miliband, and concerns over another coalition?
@sunbeam007 @DPJHodges cool, now following! Thank you
@Alex_Wage lots of talk that media image of Miliband might have swung voters to 'keep him out'
@Alex_Wage I suppose Twitter isn't a reflection our society as a whole
@Alex_Wage I've been trying to understand why any Labour seats became Conservative
@Kingkeir GTA V economics
@sunbeam007 Thoroughly enjoyed reading your TL this morning, Sunny! I always feel like I'm learning
I'm not pretending to be an expert in politics, I'm just wondering
Or even, how much of an effect did public image have on any of the politicians success?
How much of an effect has Miliband's public image had?
@Phaetonv2 @Maxama10 damn, I thought red too! Haha!
@Phaetonv2 @Maxama10 jheez, photo on the left is very "this is Sevilla winger Abshir when he was younger"
@Phaetonv2 @Maxama10 haha! Dude your whole squad on point

@Alex_Wage where did you get 3-0 from ffs
@Alex_Wage the scene of the FIFA chat CL semi final as well
@Alex_Wage what have you become?

@ACMilandrew hahaha, true
@ACMilandrew Mourinho to call an emergency press conference

Next week needs a Bayern Munich goal
Boateng spun, goodness
Neymar just hates Germany
7-1 will do that to you
BEST GOALKEEPER EVER
Ribery and Robben <WEARY FACE>
That first half was played at a ridiculous pace
Poor timing from Fenomeno
Imagine that line up if either Ribery or Robben were fit <WEARY FACE>
@Brohan_Cruyff ah sick! Yes!
@Brohan_Cruyff although he should've been RR on the count of not being white
@Brohan_Cruyff hahaha! Yes!
@Ros24s <PENSIVE FACE>
@Ros24s he's so amazing isn't he? Ah man, I think Kroos has already done well!
@DanTheDazzler ah ffs I didn't even mean it
I expect Toni Kroos to control the second leg.
@Ros24s hahaha that's true! Maybe his love for Thiago meant Kroos was always going to be second choice?
@Ros24s although tonight I think the Real midfield was  convincingly outplayed, props to Juventus
@Ros24s he was absolutely fantastic during that ridiculous winning streak, maybe he's tired?
Tbh, I think only James Rodriguez had a good game, everyone was pretty poor for Real
I'm a big fan of Toni Kroos but tonight he struggled to orchestrate play
Really didn't expect Juventus to win so convincingly tonight, that performance was impressive, but I agree with Keane: Madrid not out yet
@Vitu_E ah man, what's this?
@Phaetonv2 Bro, I finally got round to reading your Rousey article, and it was magnificent! Great work!
@pn_steve_wilson @TheCricketGeek maybe it's different because England players feel it as pressure, while opposition see it as patronising?
"I can't properly explain"
Don't worry breh, I'll explain for you - you're a  xenophobe
He explains the dichotomy of his experiences so clearly, yet he remains so oblivious
It is too early for that kind of foolishness

Mayn, West Indies winning a Test is one of the coolest things
If it saves Test cricket, so be it. But I would be pretty gutted
Like an IPL meets clunty cricket, I guess?
Test cricket part of last RT boils down to, maybe we should have a draft system for test matches?
Only Boult and World's Handsomest Man(TM) Southee in May
Anyway, not to worry boys, only New Zealand and Australia in the summer <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
How many more times will a "mediocre" side have to beat England before these pundits accept that maybe England aren't so great
Bob Willis' post-mortems always manage to get my dad &amp; me to crack up."X are a mediocre side and England should be beating them comfortably"
Test match losses to Sri Lanka at home, and now the West Indies away, continue to be covered up by the home series win v disinterested India
It's really impressive that they could be so resilient even without so many of their T20 stars.
So happy for the West Indies, that crowd in Bridgetown looked magnificent
@Vitu_E bahahah
@Voodoo_Rays @AdamYV
Ffs he is magnificent 
@DKDickson @shivamLM yeah you're probably right about Tyson!
@jamesa18 preach
@shivamLM man really thought I saw it on FB
@Ragulator @shivamLM it actually is I think!
@shivamLM it's your actual birthday?! Happy birthday, Shivam! I hope you have an amazing day!
@DKDickson @shivamLM so, people talked about it but not many boycotted him? Lmao the Holyfield thing is more understandable though
@DKDickson @shivamLM genuine Q: what was it like for Tyson?
And also somehow they've all managed to marry beautiful girls
The Sri Lanka team are adorable
@Vitu_E Sinhala groom outfits man

@Kahaanify both of them are ridiculously fast for CB
@JamesBusher so strange. It's like you're talking about a different man to the one who was at City
Jerome Boateng v Raphael Varane over 30 yards, who wins?
@fern_n_coke Ah <PENSIVE FACE> everyone's rooting for him though!
@jmikemac Yeah, same here, I like his technique, ridiculous pace and composure
@Ashley_Escobar If not Klopp, who else?
@Ashley_Escobar oh for sure his man management this season has been so strange. It's really difficult to explain from the outside
@JamesBusher he got all kinda stick for the mistake v Ag√ºero haha but good to hear it's rare!
That England scorecard makes for some pretty miserable reading, Cook aside.

@OllyDawes Oh wow, win and you're promoted?
@OllyDawes Ah wicked! Good luck v Colchester! I hope you don't get your heart broken in Essex
@JamesBusher How do you feel about Boateng's "lack of concentration"?
@Ashley_Escobar This is a huge summer though. LFC can't afford to be left behind
@Ashley_Escobar Every club except Chelsea is either stalling or transitioning, so maybe keep Rodgers whilst LFC rebuild
@Ashley_Escobar It would've been nearly impossible to build on last year, especially without Suarez/Sturridge for large parts
@Ashley_Escobar Fair enough! I agree with you re: any other club he'd be sacked, disagree about him having messed up
@OllyDawes Feels like ages!
@OllyDawes I'm good thank you Olly! Just gotta prepare for exams and stuff! how are you? how is work?
@shivamLM Zouma-Mangala
@shivamLM One day maybe!
@JamesBusher I've not seen nearly enough Bayern to comment, I was just wondering!
@JamesBusher I was looking for a youtube video of him and Benatia because you/The Game podcast said they were the best CBs around
@OllyDawes It seems as though maybe his injuries have caught up with him, and each time he comes back, maybe hes trying too hard to impress?
@OllyDawes Ah man, I feel bad for Kompany, he was a really awesome defender and leader for City. He should be remembered as a City great.
@OllyDawes Also, City just seem to suck at developing young players.
@OllyDawes I'm really not sure! It seems like Boateng and Pique had kinda similar careers, maybe the pressure at such a young age?
@eaststand14 Damn. What was it about him?
If not, he's at least most improved. He was laughed out of the Premier League
Jerome Boateng: Most complete centre back?
@eaststand14 yeah, I was so young at the time it seemed like he'd never leave.
NY style pizza is at once the worst and best pizza you've ever had

@Ashley_Escobar maybe, but what counts as success/improvement for Liverpool? Top four? (Assuming it's out of the question this season)
@Ashley_Escobar omg just seen your avatar hahahaha
@Ashley_Escobar Oh okay wicked! I just don't know many who do/just listened to them talk about PSV this morning haha
@fern_n_coke what's happened?
@Kingkeir lmao yeah yeah
@Ashley_Escobar would he even have a say?
@Ashley_Escobar Do you listen to the Game podcast by the times? I reckon you'd love it
I haven't got any bad things to say about Vieira. He's about as infallible as footballers get.
Fair enough, Patrick

@Ragulator never had butternut squash curry, but beetroot curry rocks
@Ragulator it's got great reviews on timeout and where to eat London app so they're super packed out now, but I think that makes it more fun
@Ragulator prices for mutton haha! I think it's good value considering the quality 
@Ragulator That's all I ordered but I went with cousins for my dad's birthday and ended up eating a bit of everything <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@Ragulator lastly, the devilled squid was brilliant! Everyone had something to rave about from S Indian masala dosa to SL string hopper fry
@Ragulator and full of tamarind but I think they use tomatoes instead and it comes out so creamy and luxurious haha!
@Ragulator I tried the aubergine curry (obviously), and even though it's not what I expect, it was really lovely. Normally it's quite dark
@Ragulator You could tell from the devilled mutton that this place is Sri Lankan - lots of fiery ginger, and the mutton was so soft!
@Ragulator I order devilled mutton with vechu roti/parotta, and yeah. That was magnificent. It was good enough alone! 
@Ragulator Fish cutlets were massive hahah never had one so big, but it didn't affect the taste! I think they've got frying on lock<OK HAND SIGN>üèæ
@Ragulator I'd say it's like top 5 in town? Ruby's, Suvai Aruvi, Yhaal House, Jaffna House, Apollo

@AndyHamilton13 @TheRegista_ @will9123 fair enough, someone or something has upset him - hopefully Guardiola's conference will help clear
@TheRegista_ @will9123 Fair enough, maybe you're right, we'll see how it pans out. Although, the timing of his resignation is interesting
@TheRegista_ @will9123 And if he's to be taken at face value, then I think it's possible they could've argued after the match
@TheRegista_ @will9123 Only Dr M√ºller-Wohlfahrt's quotes in this 

Unless he's making things up
@will9123 @TheRegista_ regardless, no reason why Guardiola couldn't have had a go at the doctor at another time
@will9123 @TheRegista_ ah it was just something Marcotti Rt'd I think haha
@will9123 @TheRegista_ seems shoulder length in the vine and in this photo? 
I expect Guardiola to publicly apologise once the dust has settled
More than being famous, Dr M√ºller-Wolhfahrt is highly-respected in his field. Seems a shame for Bayern to have lost this long relationship
@GuardiolaTweets 
@TheRegista_ is this him walking away? Can't tell, in a lecture haha 
72 year old famous sports medicine doctor can't catch a damn break
Good for you, Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt
What a horrible deal that'd be
@Alex_Wage what's going on there? Haha looks so strange
@Alex_Wage idk how I'd feel - the British BVB Brigade has been much quieter recently
@RemmideM @Alex_Wage ¬ø
@Maxama10 ah nice! I meant his adult one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Maxama10 you're live tweeting his video?
@Alex_Wage Klolp
Selfie <MAN>üèæ
@MickeyKane_ Ye does this on regs
@Alex_Wage pushed the boat out I see
Dani Carvajal's touch!
Honestly thought that was Ronaldo on the break there! Varane flying!
@Ashley_Escobar Yeah for sure, doesn't look good but 
I guess Monaco did spend a load of money on him, but for me WC2014 was the first time I'd seen him play, and he's been ace ever since
James Rodriguez is like a dream.
Gareth Bale with hair like "The Vigilante" Sting imo
Toni Kross is a ballerina
Toni Kroos' shape as he makes a cross-field pass, or when he takes a set-piece, is reminiscent of Beckham imo
Toni Kroos is chocolate fondant
What's a good luxurious thing to compare something to?

Mummy Bear -"Wouldn't be the first time."

Toni Kroos is luxurious
@Ragulator @millsypie Happy New Year guys!

@Alex_Wage Lmao, what's the jackpot?
@Alex_Wage yeah must be a great atmosphere
@Alex_Wage oh skeen
@Alex_Wage start-up life?
@Alex_Wage and someone will probably luck out on Juventus 5-0 Monaco or something
@Alex_Wage wicked, that sounds pretty much perfect! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@Alex_Wage <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Alex_Wage is work fun? Are you enjoying it?
@Alex_Wage haha just sensible really
@Alex_Wage "You've got Dani Carvajal as first goalscorer and FT score 0-0?"
@Alex_Wage it's not that common but some craft brew places have it haha
@Alex_Wage Juventus 2-0 AS Monaco, Atletico Madrid 1-1 Real Madrid IMO
@Alex_Wage breath bated
@Alex_Wage <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è every time I'm at Mother Kelly's/Carpenters' Arms here, I have Schneider Weisse and get to tell the story haah (})
@Marcotti or is it just a really odd transfer? (For the moment)
@Marcotti Thank you for your article in The Game today, Gab - I was wondering whether there was reason for Real Madrid to spend so much?
@Ragulator @millsypie Cool! I'll try but just wanted to let you know exams don't finish til August <WEARY FACE>
@Ragulator @millsypie It'd be ace! Exam season though D:

@Maxama10 remember you introduced me to him! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@Maxama10 Hahahah actually it might've been!
@Maxama10 it was beautiful
@Maxama10 ah man the other day I saw a video which must've been like 2 mins of pitch invaders running to hug Ronaldinho/other players bowing
*Miggy D's entrance music blaring/pyro going off*
Lmao, who saw that coming?
Oh wow wtf
@Maxama10 :D
@Alex_Wage Big up Bolasie!

@Ashley_Escobar @samuelruback your John Glenson hate is well documented
@AdamYV yeah same here man, or Joey Bada$$ haha
@Ashley_Escobar @samuelruback ah fair enough haha
@samuelruback @Ashley_Escobar with the transfer ban, I guess it put him in an even stronger position
@AdamYV maybe haha, I'm not 100% - Hannan probably would

@AdamYV lmao, too gassed after the weekend so <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@ACMilandrew (Although trailer makes it seem like Will falls for Margot and I really Cba for that)
@ACMilandrew hahaha! No, please go on - I haven't seen that but figures from the trailer (Before Kingsman) that it'd be good
@ACMilandrew Woah! I made the same comparison but had a totally different opinion - I thought Kingsman was an awesome film!
@jakeandamir @JakeHurwitz &lt;3 thank you, you guys! I love you x
Thank you Jake and Amir &lt;3 
@ACMilandrew hahaha! Did you enjoy the film? I went because my friends wanted to watch it, but I still found it pretty hilarious
@ACMilandrew btw Tome, can you explain why Diesel and Statham would drive their cars into each other? Twice?
@ACMilandrew @Ashley_Escobar hahaha fair enough, yeah didn't want to criticise a tribute, but that sucked. WWE does better tributes
@wozznotwas I'm very much the same :-) goodnight!
@wozznotwas haha, man that's totally fine! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@wozznotwas and don't worry Warren, I don't think it makes you any less of a man if you don't like F&amp;F!
@wozznotwas I know they're supposed to be fun and stupid but this one was way dumb, idk
@wozznotwas I can't remember ever watching any of the others but my sister says we used to watch them together
Must be nice to be an actor in Fast and Furious knowing you can be rubbish and still make millions for years and years
@ACMilandrew @Ashley_Escobar honestly, the ending is about the only thing they even nearly did right imo
@ACMilandrew @Ashley_Escobar was waiting to watch the film to reply to this hahaha

@ARajakanthan Hahahah ace
@Alex_Wage goodnight bro! (})
@Alex_Wage I just hope he does something positive during his time at Arsenal
@Alex_Wage you must've been the only Palace fan who was excited <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> yeah, it's so strange!

@Kahaanify I want Bhuvi in there
@Kahaanify really scraping the bottom of the barrel here... Cricket is not a handsome man's game
@Kahaanify BMac, ?, Dravid, Sangakkara, du Plessis, ?, ?, ?, Southee, Philander, Anderson, Steyn.
Starc &gt; Johnson imo
@Kahaanify which Mitch?
@Kahaanify hahaha, fine fine
@Kahaanify could maybe make a Handsome XI: ?, ?, Dravid, Sangakkara, du Plessis, ?, ?, ?, Southee, ?, Steyn
@Kahaanify hahaha, I like Rahul Dravid but cmon
Can't stop watching his inswinging yorker to Moeen Ali

@TheCricketGeek I'm so happy, he was so great during the World T20

@robbro7 always
Arsenal can't have nice things
TL is just a massive Coquelin-fest
Just seen the score <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I wonder if Arsenal will have enough width or pace to counter Liverpool (should they sit back and happily cede possession)
@DanTheDazzler yeah, I mean, guess we shouldn't expect much when the man with a tattoo of Bulgaria is representing Russia
@DanTheDazzler Hahahah that was unfortunate
@DanTheDazzler Yeah I see what you mean, it's heel behaviour but this sucks because loads of people will think Samoans actually do this
@DanTheDazzler ffs, that's pretty bad isn't it?
Paul Heyman thinks Samoans are cannibals?
"We have Anderson, Broad, Woakes, who can bounce them out?!" FOH
Cork coming across pretty backward on The Verdict (yeah I'm weeks behind). Speaking so lowly of Bangladesh
Also pretty ridiculous how, on the international stage, England sucks at both cricket and football
Ffs so many times we've heard 'Oh, if only West Indian cricket wasn't such a shambles...' <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
What does it say of English cricket if the West Indies and Pakistan beat Test-playing nations/made it to the QFs lmao
@Kahaanify @shivamLM thanks!
@Kahaanify @shivamLM ah fair enough, still forgot how much Wenger spent on Chambers
@shivamLM forgot how damn expensive Chambers and Lovren were
Highlights of New Zealand v South Africa still make no sense. What a ridiculous match!
@frnzd yeah man, considering who they do draft.
@JonnyGabriel That is awful, I hope you're okay, Jonny

@MickeyKane_ subtweeting Jack?
@robbro7 *Capello couldn't reach the fans' unrealistic expectations
@robbro7 hope for, seeing as even Capello couldn't stop them under-performing
@robbro7 I always thought Redknapp's England would have actually been alright. I'm sure they'd relate to him and I guess that's all we could
@Phaetonv2 I'm still holding out on Cole, hoping that one day he'll produce an album which is indisputably brilliant
@Phaetonv2 also the outro is freaking dope AF ill give him that

@Ordnances hahahah
Also, Sarfraz Ahmed as deputy is a sensible choice. Seems like he is the future of #Pak ODI/t20 cricket
Azhar Ali last played an ODI for Pakistan in 2013, but this kinda makes sense if he is there to replace Misbah as the calm-head
PCB #Pak select Azhar Ali as ODI captain 
@Kingkeir it's more enjoyable for him maybe, but I find it weird that NZ being nice unsettled him.
@Kingkeir Idk, I think if you're good at something, use it to your advantage - BH great sledger, so I get why he wants to sledge
@Kingkeir #Thirsty #Beers #Boys #Drink #Headache #Warnie #Pup #Weekend #BoysAreThirsty
@Kingkeir ,as Haddin says, it is provoked by Kiwis being "too nice"
@Kingkeir What about it? I don't think it's awful to sledge, it's just a bit strange when it's unprovoked, even stranger if ...
What a clown! Haddin defends sledging because Kiwis were "too nice"

If yesterday were England v Australia, and say, it were Pietersen playing as McCullum, I don't think we'd ever hear the end of it.
@ajarrodkimber Lovely article at cricinfo, Jarrod - I was just wondering how New Zealand was reacting to the final/how McCullum batted
Cricket is such a fantastic sport even though it is plagued by problems with actual politics and cricket-politics
This World Cup really made me love New Zealand cricket, and it seems like it is a beautiful country of beautiful people. #NZ

@niles1991 @Ragulator @shivamLM @Sharkydave44 I'm also out, enjoy the cricket guys!
@judeinlondon Lmao, all I have is #SA balls = borls, right = rh-oightt. All three of these accents are brilliant haha!
@ParmSahota Exactly!
@judeinlondon hahaha I love the accent! I want to be able to do it
@Sharkydave44 @Ragulator @shivamLM hahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Harsha has buckled!
#Kiwi Bat = Bit, Six = Sux, Pad = Pid, Wickets = Wuckets. #NZ
@ParmSahota yeah they're a brave ODI side :-)
@ParmSahota but yeah, hopefully Boult/Southee can pull off some magic
@ParmSahota 
@Vitu_E and Graeme Smith has a strangely seductive yet reassuring voice
@ParmSahota they punch well above their weight
@ParmSahota Idk if it's fair to compare with rugby as this is the first cricket final #NZ have played, but yeah, small country of 4.5m ppl
A more experienced side may have constructed their innings differently... Nevertheless, the future is bright for #NZ. Their time will come.
It's difficult to criticise #NZ though as this same cavalier approach is what brought them to the final.
We all fell for their exhilarating batting and their phenomenal fast bowling, but today, maybe #NZ were na√Øve and not pragmatic enough
#NZ undone by their inexperience at the very highest level of int'l cricket but they can be extremely proud of their performances throughout
Seems #NZ had their fairy-tale moment in the semi-final v #SA
Pace bowling on Australian wickets continues to be King.
Absolutely fantastic fast bowling and fielding effort from #Aus. A brilliant all-round team performance.
@D_iGital_pUnk we both were :-(
@Vitu_E lmao, gotta do something to distract from this mess
Emphatic end to the innings!
@ARajakanthan Henry was born in 1991 and it's like his 3rd ODI ffs
@Vitu_E like a strange disclaimer at SportsDirect
@ARajakanthan hawk-eye was gassed
@ARajakanthan asfghahaha
@ARajakanthan Starc to McCullum was 7cm and I thought that was ridic
@ARajakanthan yeah I saw that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Another brave innings from Elliott in extremely difficult circumstances for #NZ. Faulkner's bowling has further swung this game for #Aus

@ARajakanthan dangerous to stare at angry men with bats imo
@ARajakanthan hahahaha
How many yorkers have we seen today?! #Aus
@Ragulator @shivamLM I was so proud of Kohli for sticking up for himself
@Kingkeir seems that way! Brett Lee also
@Ragulator @shivamLM ah I didn't know that about him, must've gone unnoticed because of Clarke, Watson, Haddin...
4 overs of Johnson, 2 from Starc, 220 looks a long way off for #NZ
@Kingkeir didn't think so, Haddin such a tool
Was Adam Gilchrist as annoying a person as Brad Haddin?
@shivamLM @Ragulator hahah fair enough, pretty handsome imo
@shivamLM @Ragulator what's Starc done?
@ARajakanthan on second look, seems like fantastic bowling
Daniel Vettori, the left handed, bespectacled, bearded slow bowler with a beautiful on-drive for all the #hipsters
Gutted. #NZ
@ARajakanthan can't decide if it was bad batting or brilliant bowling because of the middle stump yorker
@judeinlondon right? My Singaporean friends just cba haha
@ARajakanthan yeah Elliott and Taylor  did New Zealand proud and then those two clowns came in
@Ragulator Bahahah
@ARajakanthan well, like also those first six
<BABY CHICK><BABY CHICK><BABY CHICK> McCullum, Anderson, Ronchi. #NZ
@judeinlondon tournament started 2 months ago, there's only 10 teams <WEARY FACE>
@judeinlondon lmao, cricket makes itself difficult to love
@judeinlondon tbf, difficult to wake up at 3am, watch a 6h game which is ultimately not that meaningful (so many group games)
Australia napped for 25 overs.
Goodness.
@Ragulator on paper
@Ragulator I guess so, I'd expect little from de Kock but du Plessis/de Villiers could probably rebuild. Their batting order is ridiculous
@Kingkeir hahahah
Yeah, nah fair enough, that's fantastic
Bump catch imo
@Ragulator lmao cool
@Kahaanify ah okay, fair enough, more so than is normal?
@Kahaanify don't forget Trent-o
@Ragulator sure, it was just a hypothetical question. Would their top order have also had problems?/Australia unplayable? etc
@Ragulator ah okay! Yeah, definitely! Damn shame
@Ragulator what do you mean?
@Ragulator no argument from me! Just wondering what people thought
@fern_n_coke oh they're just booing him anyway
Would de Kock, Amla and du Plessis have fared better than Guptil, McCullum and Williamson? NZ #SA #Aus

Mitchell Johnson back RT @Julien1886: #NZ starting to rebuild but have to take full advantage of these 5/6th bowler overs #CWC15Final
Grant Elliot channeling his inner Mahela Jayawardene
@Cricketbatcat oops meant to reply to the Double Hundred tweet haha
@Cricketbatcat hahaha! I hope so!
#NZ starting to rebuild but have to take full advantage of these 5/6th bowler overs
@GeoffLemonSport have to agree, yeah
Srinivasan or Blatter?
@fern_n_coke ahh maybe that's why there were boos at the start of Watson's over?
@fern_n_coke do they know he's on TV? Haha
Goodness
@fern_n_coke hahahaha
Credit to Watson for his online reaction to Wahab Riaz's phenomenal spell, but I still think he's a jerk
What was that reaction to Watson?
@j_hussain that's true but I can't help but feel that was pretty much a different Australia side to the team today. Plus it's not in NZ :-(
Is that Graeme Smith? With that voice it's no surprise he was South Africa's youngest ever captain
@j_hussain pretty gutted for New Zealand
@j_hussain haha! It was easy to in the end! I was bleary eyed but once Starc was at the top of his run-up I was wide awake
@Kingkeir Slow-mo was unforgiving, Elliot stuck to the hi-5 despite Taylor's spud/fist bump
Yes! Fantastic for #NZ!
@ishangodbole his voice is incredibly annoying. The way he paces sentences...
@ishangodbole Pommie Mbangwa...
@ishangodbole pretty much spot on, yeah! Nasser and Atherton <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Could #NZ defend 250? #Aus #CWC15Final
@ishangodbole ah okay, I read B| as <NEUTRAL FACE>. He's got a great voice tbf
@shivamLM yeah, fair enough - I was thinking of comparing #Aus to Mourinho/Ferguson! Fantastic mental strength
@ishangodbole Hahaha he's the Henry Winter of cricket and seemingly oblivious to his #Aus bias
@shivamLM 
@ishangodbole Ah okay, yeah - Pakistan a great example of that. If they bothered to practice fielding properly...
@ishangodbole Atm #Aus flying high, but before the last Ashes they were a joke. Lehmann seems to have done a great job, (sadly)
@ishangodbole What does that mean?
Clarke getting through Hazelwood and Maxwell overs early to add insult to injury
Australian belief, self-confidence and determination is unbelievable.
Ha. #Aus
#NZ openers failed and now there's ridiculous pressure on Taylor, Elliot and Anderson. Just give Boult something to defend.
Let's all go to bed and pretend this didn't happen.
JP Maxwell
Commentators suggesting #NZ would look to defend 275/280 but, I'd back #Aus to chase 300/310.
@ARajakanthan he was my favourite as well. Pfft, Ah well
@ARajakanthan *or so I remember
@ARajakanthan he was also a jerk almost immediately after retiring and stabbed everyone in the back
Swann can gtfo and all
Kumar Williamson
Some merit to LRT, but surely after being convincingly beaten by two consecutive deliveries, McCullum ought to have chilled out?

McCullum out bowled. Reckless &amp; irresponsible.

#Narrative

#CW‚Ä¶
@ARajakanthan :-(
@ARajakanthan talking about Williamson v Hazlewood just there? No idea. Beautiful technique!
@ARajakanthan yeah man, definitely! Growing up I saw lots of #Aus Test highlights and I was always really surprised at how many 3s theyd run
Devastated by that early loss. Waking up off 2h sleep, watching McCullum get tortured like that, felt like a punch to the stomach
Dust is slowly settling, so: what was McCullum thinking? 3 wild swings, 0 hits. #ThreeStrikesAndYoureOut
@ARajakanthan I've never seen anything as confusing as those three deliveries
@ishangodbole Yup. But he was unbelievable at one point and the GOAT #SL pace bowler 
You just know Malinga was watching over #StarcVMcCullum
So important now that #NZ forget about McCullum and continue to take the attack to #Aus. They can't afford to score slowly in this PP
@ARajakanthan yup.
Fantastic bowling from Starc, brainless batting from McCullum and now #Aus are heavy favourites. #NZ #Ffs
Ought to have been asleep by now <WEARY FACE>
When's the coin toss?
@j_hussain hahaha i figured! Tbh Id be so psyched to see Sting!
@j_hussain haha! I haven't watched RAW since Christmas though :-(
@j_hussain yeah man! Gonna sleep in a bit and then get up hahaha but probably means WM is out the window
So psyched for this #Aus #NZ
@Alex_Wage <BROKEN HEART>
@D_iGital_pUnk could well happen
@Jessicaveronica @Alex_Wage
#Aus really heavy favourites but #NZ are just so beautiful, fun and adventurous!
@Kahaanify oh fair enough, yeah MS is fantastic, one of my favourite players in the sport. This WC was always going to be tough for Asians
@Kahaanify MS?
@SimpsonsClobber @Alex_Wage
@Kahaanify Ah man, I'm sorry. I think #Ind fans ought to be proud of their dominance in the group stage - besides, no shame falling to #Aus

@j_hussain 94-3 off 19 overs chasing 327. Kohli gone cheaply as well
@judeinlondon 
Unless MS Dhoni can do something unbelievable
Shame, that's pretty much game over for #Ind
Phwoar
@judeinlondon yeah, horrible for #Ind but the atmosphere was nothing compared to #NZ v #SA! Arent hashflags the best??
#Aus once again proving that they bat all the way down the order with Johnson's 27(9).
@sunbeam007 329 to win! Does that change anything? India's bowling at the death was quite good imo
329 to win? #Ind can chase this
@sunbeam007 oh wow, really? Only going at 5.19/over, but I guess they have wickets in hand?
@sunbeam007 already?

Let's not forget how Steyn defended 7 runs in the final over of their t20 World Cup match.
How different would that match have been if McCullum didn't deal with Steyn so easily?
@Kahaanify Ah fair enough, I like both #SA and #NZ but Steyn is my favourite from both sides. I felt for him today
Stoked for #NZ!
@Kahaanify :-( are you a massive #SA fan or just Morne?
@Kahaanify why?
#SA can be proud of their bowling which kept this game close to the final over. Their day will come, but destiny seems on the side of #NZ
Congratulations #NZ! What a fantastic resilience!
Wow, that was a phenomenal finish to a wonderful match #NZ #SA
Ffs #NZ
LIVE 
#NZ really going out of their way to steal the #SA choker tag
@judeinlondon woo! Should've tweeted from #NZ
@judeinlondon goodness that's amazing, I'm with O2 haha
@judeinlondon I've got it but I don't have much data <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@judeinlondon hate that I'm on the way to uni <WEARY FACE>
Morkel deserves a lot of credit, he often doesn't make full use of his height, pace &amp; bounce, but today had McCullum &amp; Williamson bunched up
#SA have done brilliantly to drag themselves back into the match, the McCullum onslaught seemed to have put #NZ so far ahead
Tahir gets ridiculous rip, guy is talented.
Imran Tahir is causing problems immediately! This is ridiculous! #SA
How is he doing this to Dale Steyn? #McCullum #NZ
Oh that is fantastic! #McCullum #NZ
Ooft how lovely was that shot from Guptil?
Goodnight x
Faf is so excited he can't tweet properly!
@judeinlondon these flags are awesome! Who are you supporting? I'm off to bed! Goodnight x
@judeinlondon yeah it's a marathon! I mean, #SL obvs but between #SA and #NZ, I really don't know. #NZ?
@eaststand14 you reckon? Fair enough, it's not GKMC...
@j_hussain I know, it's terrible :/ I guess it'll always be tough for someone! Will you be watching?
@judeinlondon haha! Yup! I'm so excited! About to head to bed so I can hopefully watch a bit before uni tomorrow! Will you be watching?
@j_hussain yeah! #NZ v #SA! Gonna head to bed now and see if I can catch a bit before uni haha
Ultimately, I'm excited AF for this match and I can't sleep. I hope whoever wins this tie ends up as World Champions.
#SA stumbled through the group but should be buoyed by the 9 wicket win over #SL. Their XI is so talented, they're capable of anything.
IMO, whilst #NZ have a stronger bowling line-up, #SA may have a stronger batting order. Hopefully, this means that we'll see a close game!
Whilst #NZ have been fantastic throughout the World Cup, #SA have possibly the most talented squad at the tournament
@OllyDawes @wozznotwas hahaha don't be silly, you can have an opinion! I just can't get past the moaning, I'll listen again haha
I suppose we can question their 4th and 5th bowler, but only because #NZ have been so dominant that they have barely needed them.
#NZ have everything you'd expect from World Cup winners: strong top &amp; middle order, outstanding pace bowling, a true leader and home support
@OllyDawes @wozznotwas eugh oh man I hate that track
#NZ v #SA should be an awesome tight game but as we saw with #SL things don't always turn out as expected
@wozznotwas Blacker the Berry and i <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@wozznotwas Ah really? I'll listen again, I love it all from Wesley's Theory on til Alright, which I can't dig
@wozznotwas Oooh hahaha
@Debaser92 wicked :-) im expecting this to be the tie of the tournament
@Debaser92 thank you!
@Debaser92 okay cool, was thinking 6-7. Trying to see if I can sleep and then wake up before uni to watch the game haha
Guys, for how many hours do ODIs normally last?
@NeilSandwich hahaha I love this, I had to retweet again

@NeilSandwich he'll literally RT anything with lions, I don't even get the first one

It's certainly not the quality I would've expected from Cole's 3rd album. Maybe it would've been a promising debut
Listening to #ForestHillsDrive again, and maybe I was too harsh on it the first time but, this really isn't a game-changing album
Nonetheless, it's strong enough to cement Kendrick's status as the King of Hip-Hop
TPAB is a great record but, perhaps not surprisingly, it's not as magnificent as GKMC.
After my first listen I really thought maybe this was the moment when I could no longer relate to, or enjoy, hip-hop hahaha
I'm on my 7th or 8th play-through of To Pimp a Butterfly and, as @newschambers said, it gets better with every listen!

No idea why the Cricket World Cup semi-finals are held on Tuesday and Thursday.
@fuzel07 wheeeeey
Repeats of PSG v Barcelona and Atletico v Real mean we have two byes for Juventus and Bayern
Completely missed the Champions League QF draw, what did you guys make of it?

@ARajakanthan #Pak #Pak #Pak
After the reports of #Pak players dismissing fielding practice, idk what I expected. When will the joke end?
Watson 64(53)* #ThanksRahat
@rustyjacko what's the point? He'd only fumble :-(
Ffs. How does Wahab pick himself up after that?
That's disgusting. Wahab Riaz deserves so much better than that. Absolutely terrible fielding, 83-4 would've been fantastic for #Pak
Yeah, that's Pakistan. #Pak
Yep.
@Kahaanify yeah, fair enough, I was wrong.
@Kahaanify really? Fine, that's that 1% then. He's such a wasteman
@Kahaanify idk he's just always really verbally aggressive towards Asian players.
@Kahaanify 99% sure he's racist
#HateShaneWatson
#Pak performing is actually rarer than an eclipse
@eaststand14 yeah I think you're right!
@davidjaca haha yeah! So many good reasons, it's pretty strange to think it was flailing a little while back!
@davidjaca I hadn't thought of that! No doubt it helps build a winning mentality
@davidjaca potential to be a great tournament! A lot of fun clubs in there, and a lot of talented players
@davidjaca I guess it helps that the grand prize is entry to CL as well? I'm sure all FM/PES fans always thought Europa League had the
@newschambers hahaha I'll take your word for it!
@NapoliBlogger Oh man, they are so lifeless aren't they? Luckily master league is just so damn good!
ITV4 got the PES2015 commentators on...
@newschambers wow! Idk if I can believe that
@newschambers alright I'm excited! It's a statement for sure, already smashes Cole out the water
@newschambers I like King Kunta but it sounds claustrophobic? Like the way the beat slowly ramps up hahaha
@newschambers it's definitely not easy-listening haha! After listening to "i" before the drop, I expected something totally different
@newschambers I actually don't know, I couldn't find it on TV haha
@newschambers also, I'm sorry about the Roma result :/
@davidjaca also is this just because yall won last season? Haha
@davidjaca what did they do to make it exciting and relevant?
@newschambers I've only heard 3/4 of it, idk if I'm feeling it, but I'll let it breathe and give it every chance
@shivamLM hahaha cmon man
@newschambers listened to TPAB?

@ElpidaAl hahaha, ffs I should've known... Nobody ever wants to talk about cricket :/
@ElpidaAl oh right, not even! It's the Quarter Final stage now and really there seems little interest (here)
@ElpidaAl what do you mean, sorry?
Most matches seem to end amicably. Idk, almost as though the World Cup is just a bunch of friendlies
Sri Lanka crash out of the World Cup and little inquisition was made
Cricket is such a strange sport - huge fanbase concentrated in pockets around the world, and seems like little media/fan pressure
Berlin, Melbourne, Tokyo the new London, Paris, New York?

Everything will be okay 
@Kahaanify So far SL have played well, but most of the impressive batting performances are Sanga/Dilshan, not great for future
@Kahaanify Hahaha, there's no way Sri Lanka will make the final. Pre-tournament I said I'd be happy with QF exit and good performances
Good omen...

He gets hate for not being an interesting pundit, but tonight he's been ace. He's also really naturally charismatic and has great cadence
Thierry Henry tonight <OK HAND SIGN><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@DKDickson hahaha Ah man, I'm sorry Dave! Just put the 2012 DVD on
@DKDickson and if the squad isn't large enough, it contradicts what Mourinho said in the summer. Either way League champions anyway
@DKDickson Idk your squad but there must be some sort of back-up? Remy, Salah, Ramires all great choices
Mourinho's lack of rotation now seems even more strange
@fuzel07 fair enough!
@tomvictor Ffs as if I didn't completely erase this from my memory
@fuzel07 *leg
@fuzel07 of course, didn't they lose that tie though?
@DKDickson IDK what the stats are but I was so convinced Chelsea would walk it, I thought 1-1 aggregate it'd be impossible to qualify
@frnzd true haha but he was never going to miss
I was really watching the second half thinking, "Have 10-men ever won away in the Champions League?"
Everyone laughing at Thiago Silva and David Luiz pre-match, what you saying?
Brilliant! Big up PSG!
What a hilarious penalty. #Composed
Thiago Silva undoes David Luiz's brilliance.
@shivamLM @ChelseaFC you want picking up, or?
What a ball! What a delivery! That is a fantastic set-piece, a fantastic header. Just wow. Incredible
OOOOOOHHHH BABY
Very impressed by 10-man PSG so far
Cavani didn't choke, he just messed up bad
Welbz &gt; Cavani
Even worse than last season.
Wow.
Cumbersome
That Diego Costa run was so the opposite of agile
@robbro7 @BenMcAleer1 bahahah I choked on my water <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@tomvictor @robbro7 @judeinlondon I'm not so sure, because it's exam season :(
@Phaetonv2 I'm a fan of both, just messing - reminds me of Nasri v Porto though
@Phaetonv2 fake Nasri
@judeinlondon @tomvictor it's free? <DIZZY FACE>
@judeinlondon @tomvictor oh okay fair enough :-(
@judeinlondon @tomvictor ah man, that sucks, but wouldn't the trip be worth that flight?
@wozznotwas there's one where he slaps the camera and the loop is great
@wozznotwas oooooft
@tomvictor @judeinlondon Smfh she's in NYC??
@wozznotwas hahaha I am indeed, he was so jokes during my 6th form
@tomvictor that restaurant is right next to nude espresso as well!
@tomvictor hahaha yup! It's hard to tell which is better, I've only had Lucky Chip once so I'll go with Bleecker!
Lucky Chip gotta be one of the best burgers in town
@wozznotwas he's one of the first people I ever followed, you've made a great decision haha
@Alex_Wage this interview was so meh haha
@Alex_Wage asfghahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> the url
@wozznotwas oh right yeah that makes sense!
@wozznotwas same, where did he go?
Oh wow, just seen the Schalke score. Mir must suck to win 4-3 at Bernabeu and still be knocked out
@MercurialRossi lmao ffs he has no chill
@robbro7 hahaha play nice
@MercurialRossi lmao he definitely had a lot tbf, he was Ballon d'Or winner etc etc it's tough
@MercurialRossi this? 
@robbro7 @Ordnances oooh, okay yeah - is this the ice hockey one? That also makes me feel something. Sadness? I forget
@MercurialRossi <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@robbro7 @Ordnances is this the fortune teller one? It makes me so sad hahaha
@Vitu_E Btw Vithushan, could you recommend any articles about England post-Bangladesh blowout?
@Vitu_E oh wow hahaha, man.
@Vitu_E it's incredible how he managed to play so audaciously at the highest level of the sport.
@Phaetonv2 without those Brazilian heroes I wouldn't even like this sport
@Phaetonv2 then I can sleep easy haha
@Phaetonv2 not that it's difficult to understand! It's obvious! But I feel like he's seen as a joker and not a serious Ballon d'Or winner
@Phaetonv2 Yeah but you're not representative of the general population, you understand his genius
Will they rename Porto Alegre?
How will people remember Ronaldinho when he retires?
@wozznotwas we'll see
@wozznotwas Of course that is sad, but I think that it is beautiful that he was so great, yet we don't think it was even his full potenital!
@wozznotwas No worries, Warren - those are my favourite Ronaldo videos. I used to watch them every week hahaha!
@wozznotwas This part is even greater than that. Just the Juca Kfouri part  
@wozznotwas I did! haha :')
@wozznotwas 
SOU RONALDO 
@wozznotwas 
@wozznotwas Woah, half an hour! One day I will sit through this whole thing, but I will almost certainly cry.
KanyexBeethoven 
@Phaetonv2 Ah okay fair enough - instinctively it made me worry about Arsenal
@Phaetonv2 Who we talking about now?
Just hit me that Welbeck's goal is so Fenomeno Ronaldo
@Alex_Wage Accy's Fuch opens the scoring at Bernabeu
@NeilSandwich he was awesome last night and these scoring systems are kinda dumb
@NeilSandwich hahaha! I was so surprised, no other 8/10 (somehow 7/10 Cazorla 'games best player' maybe it's a glitch?)
The Times gave √ñzil 8/10 and MotM <OK HAND SIGN>
@Kingkeir yeah that's a good point
Wheeeey, finally! About time! Not sure how he managed to survive that racism scandal

Ah, it wasn't just a dream 
May all your Welbz be Danny x
@ARajakanthan it was beautiful
@Phaetonv2 @wozznotwas it has the potential to be even better because he was someone else's cult hero/local lad
Manchester United, one of the most successful clubs in the history of football, but their fans will laugh if you celebrate wins over them
@lefthog Yup, always the case when Arsenal win away
@lefthog yeah, fair enough, it's not easy
For nearly 1/3 of my life Arsenal didn't win at Utd
@lefthog lmao, can you blame me?
Acting like we're surprised Arsenal won when they can start Mesut √ñzil and Alexis Sanchez asfghaha
@judeinlondon even if Welbeck goal has nothing on Giggs or even Jones in the CL idgaf. Arsenal won! At Old Trafford! 
@judeinlondon See? Ages!
@judeinlondon Lmao, no last win at Old Trafford was when Adebayor scored that goal in the last minute and we probably finished 4th
@judeinlondon I was 7 then so I don't really remember the match or if I saw it, it's just like nice to have knocked Utd out of the cup
@robbro7 Idk that's not my job, I don't know if can Gaal is able to reflect on his work and improve
@judeinlondon It will still make me feel better after having watched that Giggs goal 100s of times over the last 15 years hahaha
@judeinlondon i was 16 when Arsenal last won at Old Trafford. Like.
@judeinlondon I didn't mean to say that this goal is as great as Giggs 99
@robbro7 they could just hire a better manager
@SergiouslyAFC Haaaaaaaaa
@judeinlondon not as good a goal, nor as important, but I mean, it's so cathartic
@judeinlondon only in terms of 'goals scored in FA Cup matches between Arsenal and Utd'. Like montage purposes.
@AdamYV Haaaaaaaa
@AdamYV this is me for like the most part of my life hahahaha
Utd fans really don't know how annoying their club is, huh?
@Alex_Wage Innit
@AdamYV it's been eight and a half years
@AdamYV a win is a win is a win
@judeinlondon FFS 
@judeinlondon it's okay, any win any time anywhere against Utd wouldve had this effect. It's been like nearly 10 years ffs
No longer will we have to watch that Giggs goal without having any reply. Thank you, Danny Welbeck
The wicked witch's curse is lifted! It's safe to come outside again, children!
@Alex_Wage hahahaha
@AdamYV I think they just felt bad for us after 8.5 years
@Alex_Wage jheez. This really hit me. When you put it like that, that's ridiculous. I'm so proud
@AdamYV yeah, nah fair enough x my bad 
@AdamYV what about baited breath?
Oh man, I don't want to lose to Liverpool in the final. It wouldn't ruin memories of this beautiful night though
Louis van Gaal: Fraud
@AdamYV <FACE THROWING A KISS>
OH WOW.
@TheRegista_ asfghahaha
Heroes. All of them. Thank you, Arsenal x <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
8 and a half years
#DATGUYWELBZ
It'd be nice if Ramsey would wake up
There is a campaign against Manchester United
@Phaetonv2 Utd to throw from 2 yards? Too many things going our way
Wow, terrible dive. Heart in mouth stuff. Thank you Mr Oliver
Oh wow that looks like a penalty. A massive massive piece of luck
Szczesny literally the anti-De Gea. Complete idiot and far too composed for someone who is so foolish
Rooney will equalise
@KaneStatton I am <PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO>
A red card at Old Trafford?!
@janhopis @NeilSandwich TOO MANY THINGS GOING OUR WAY
@NeilSandwich @janhopis that's even worse man
@DKDickson lmao yes. Do Utd have the stones?
GOD BLESS YOU THIRD UMPIRE
DECISION PENDING: OUT
Oh wow, Angel Fabian di Maria. That is terrible: superb attempt at gamesmanship but that was terrible
@janhopis @NeilSandwich why don't we have a De Gea :-(
Fantastic save. De Gea da Gawd
@janhopis I'm just scared man scared of everything
Idk why Giroud is coming on now omg
Ammaaaaa
Cazorla knows you can just clear the ball?
This high line scares me. I can take this.
Please Chambers don't do anything stupid. Just sit at RB.
Bellerin you were brilliant x
Oh my god oh my god
THANK YOU FOR CELEBRATING BUT OMG I THOUGHT YOU'D MISS XXXXX
DATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWELBZDATGUYWE
DE GEA IS NOT INVINCIBLE
HE IS DAT GUY
Walcott to never beat a man, Ramsey to freeze under pressure x
Bienvenue Abou Oxlade-Chamberlain
Of course.
Phil Jones? Disrespectful move from van Gaal
Wenger knows Di Maria on the counter is a madness, yeah?
@lxmk1 hahah!
*Furiously clicks 'show onto weaker foot' on and off and on...*
*Assistant Manager Danny Murphys advice*
"We've seen Di Maria make far too many crosses already, weve got to show him onto his weaker foot!"
Superb cross from Di Maria on the right. Damn. How often do you see that?
Yup RT @Julien1886: I don't think we will win but that was phenomenal
I don't think we will win but that was phenomenal
GOLAZO DO MONREAL
@wozznotwas sure thing <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> what a goal goal goal
How dope was that? Unreal goal.
DOPE
OH WOW
Oh my. Oh wow
@Ordnances remember the World Cup?
@wozznotwas if you don't mind, I'd be very interested hahah!
Danny Murphy like the football uncle at family parties. "√ñzil has to do more" "Young likes a dive" "Rooney is world class"
@wozznotwas oooh
@NeilSandwich once bitten twice shy
@judeinlondon no contest. His brother isn't even handsome LBR
@NeilSandwich WE GONNA LOSE SO HARD
@wozznotwas I genuinely don't know why
Is that a back 5 of Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw and Blind? 
Or Valencia, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw: Young, Blind, Herrera, AdM: Fellaini, R10?

I sang Giroud's name 4 mins into the Everton game to show him some support.

This is the reaction: 
Oh, Arsenal are playing Utd tonight? 
Goodness they both look awful
Sri Lanka once lined up with Muralitharan, Herath, Mendis and Dilshan.
@ElpidaAl oh okay, that's interesting! Thank you!
3-1 Utd
Normally Nasser Hussain's biggest fan but that was kinda dumb
"Root, what a talent he is! No matter the score, the situation, or the pressure; he's just here to score runs and win us the game" Hussain
Carberry loving every second of his analysis
To lose two wickets to run-outs is particularly embarrassing. Village cricket
Ridiculous collapse from England but maybe we should be expecting this now?
I didn't think Bangladesh had scored enough, 275 is difficult to defend, but they were so positive, brave and composed
Just seen the Bangladesh v England highlights and woooow <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ElpidaAl Ah okay, thank you! I just was embarrassed that id forgotten my French!
@KaneStatton OH WOW <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><OK HAND SIGN>
@ElpidaAl thank you, so even though it's a vowel at the start, it is √†?
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @ECB_cricket
@wozznotwas @McNeilGeorge @Debaser92 his one off tracks are better imo: return of Simba, visionz of home, Ms America and Power Trip x
@wozznotwas @McNeilGeorge @Debaser92 oh yes, okay my bad. I just play FNL straight through so I don't know many track names. It's dope
@tomvictor @TheMakeleleRole bahahaha
Euro2008 was a damn near perfect tournament. Goodnight x
@tomvictor @TheMakeleleRole eventually you fixed it by loaning Song, so it's okay
@karlsentk All the talk of Orlando reminded me of this man: 
@tomvictor @TheMakeleleRole not even a little bit
@wozznotwas @McNeilGeorge @Debaser92 never even heard of Premeditated Murder! Night guys x
@TheMakeleleRole @tomvictor In 2008 we all thought he was the Dutch Vieira 
I just hope this World Cup experience helps Mathews, Chandimal and Thirimanna grow
Yes, Dilshan, Sangakkara and Jayawardene are icons of Sri Lankan cricket, but they're also proper old. I didn't expect this.
Very small team 'mentality', (especially considering the t20 WC win), but I'm very proud of that Sri Lanka performance
@McNeilGeorge @wozznotwas @Debaser92 honestly other than GOMD and No Role Modelz I thought it was pretty poor. You'd love FNL
@wozznotwas @McNeilGeorge @Debaser92 gotta agree with that - Friday Night Lights &gt; any of his albums
@wozznotwas @McNeilGeorge @Debaser92 nobody enjoys J Cole anymore mayn
@Julien1886 @ElpidaAl
Or is it, Bienvenue √† l'Arsenal? Shiiiiii I should know this
Bienvenue au Arsenal, Fekir
Sou Ronaldo 
@tomvictor @JamieCutteridge also I can't believe I haven't been!
@tomvictor @JamieCutteridge the currywurst accounts are really quick to favourite these tweets hahaha
@tomvictor @JamieCutteridge i really hope there's a currywurst museum
@tomvictor @JamieCutteridge currywurst
@AdamYV yeah we'd have to do something like that tbh
@SarfarazA_54 He would be very proud of you Bhaijan
@AdamYV Man, finals this year will be a joke
@AdamYV Right? I guess there'll be a hailstorm on Friday
@Kahaanify yeah, Sri Lanka have lost two games and will still probably qualify 3rd. Idk they wouldn't have more groups, fewer teams/group
@Kahaanify format as in 50 over or massive schedule?
@Kahaanify Yeah I wonder too - I can't imagine this India attack doing much v NZ/Aus
This weather!
@Kahaanify Ah really, I've quite enjoyed the WC, but I've only watched a few matches
@Kahaanify nah not at all, don't worry about it! I meant the big cricket accounts
@Kahaanify yeah fair enough, I don't see many of those opinions, I just see people complaining about those opinions hahaha
@Kahaanify tbf NZ v Australia was fantastic
@grandslam50 lmao, terrible
...Xavier Doherty's figures dont reflect his outstanding bowling, he should've got a wicket. Watson bowled outstandingly" 
Thank you, Shane
"Starc was outstanding, Johnson bowled fantastically other than that one over, Faulkner changed the game with outstanding bowling,
Very proud of that batting effort
Sachitra Senanayake &gt;&gt;&gt;
Shane Warne &lt;&lt;&lt;
@Cricket_Froth smh what did he say?
Thisara Perera da Gawd
Horrible couple of minutes, both Mathews and Chandimal gone after playing on with hamstring injuries/cramp
What a hero, Chandimal <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> I think that may be his World Cup over
Superb 50 from Chandimal, hardly fluent but it came under immense pressure, and scored at a rate we'd never associate with him
Slater wants Chandimal off because he's receiving treatment for a hamstring injury. I'm sure it'll be different when it happens to Clarke
That looks like a hamstring injury man. I hope it's just cramp and he downs litres of diaoralyte
@jamesa18 I can't believe what I'm seeing from him! I hope at the end of his career, Mathews will be seen as our MSD
@Kingkeir please dont
Angelo Mathews needs to be our MSD
And with that beautiful cut, Dinesh Chandimal channels his inner Ricky Ponting
Suranganeee
All these ODIs against India finally paying off?
Angelo Mathews! What a hero!
Wow, I expected nothing from Chandimal, and I'm usually pretty negative about him, but that was a great over
@Kingkeir I hope so too but I think it's a big ask
@Kingkeir as in the tournament or the match? Either way, yeah most probably haha
@j_hussain <WEARY FACE> bowler gets the benefit of the doubt
@RoshCricket @Ragulator I hope he is
@RoshCricket @Ragulator that's fair enough Rosh
Thank you, Sangakkara <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
That skyArts advert needs the Hulkster walking out
He must have ice in his veins! How often does the Sri Lanka team bat around him?
Kumar Sangakkara! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I expect Sri Lanka to lose but I wouldn't mind so long as they played well.
Gutted. Foolish running. We needed Jayawardene to make a score.
Terrible decision. why? Aiya. Ffs
Stupid stupid running
@Ragulator @RoshCricket omg hahaha what??
Australian Sri Lankans hot AF
Sangakkara really gotta chill out
@RoshCricket @Ragulator hahaha! I wouldn't go that far!
@RoshCricket @Ragulator lmao Ah man, that sucks. Must be tough - you on the fence for this one?
@Ragulator @RoshCricket are we talking 1st generation or Australian Sri Lankans?
@Ragulator @RoshCricket really? When I was at the Oval it was all uncles and just nice people
@RoshCricket so many Sri Lankans in Australia
@RoshCricket you probably know I'm Sachitra's biggest fan, can't wait for him to find form again. Ah man, gutted. I had no idea there were
@RoshCricket how was Senanayake? I hope you're enjoying the game, I'm sorry you had idiots around you
@RoshCricket First innings was 3.30am onwards here haha so I didn't see anything! He's still relatively inexperienced at this level I guess
@andrewffernando sssssssssh don't jinx it
@Kingkeir yeah, atm I think we have 3 Aussies on commentary
We miss Herath
@Kingkeir remember that article about Channel9 commentary?
"These two won't panic" ygm, most recent World Cup winners and that
@rustyjacko @RoshCricket @ballburnisher This squad is the most well rounded, most confident, and best suited to ODI cricket
@rustyjacko @RoshCricket @ballburnisher you guys worry too much, only Australia couldve given that bowling performance v New Zealand
@barneyronay they probably want to be at home watching the cricket
It'd be nice to have a non-Aussie in comms
Absolutely terrible, lazy, stereotype
@DKDickson haha tbf it pitched on leg so it was probably worth the look
Lmao, nice of Watson to send Dilshan on his way with a bunch of Fs and Cs
Well batted, Dilshan.
Suranganeee
@j_hussain true but massive diaspora there too
Can not believe how many Sri Lanka fans there are at the SCG
Imagine Paul McCartney was making tracks with Kanye West
@DKDickson @DolphinHotel ha, well I didn't know about this. Pretty much my entire life they have been midtable or below
@DolphinHotel @DKDickson Lmao, well. That's really quite confusing
@DKDickson I've only seen that vine of the pitch invasion, seems pretty hilarious tbf
@DKDickson do Villa fans honestly claim they're still a big club? That'd be quite delusional
@DKDickson why not?
@Bureemi I don't even understand why someone like √ñzil or Alexis Sanchez would be scared? They've not had many whippings from Utd yet! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Bureemi yup! I'm not going near it! Hahahah
@shrek2be *added coconut milk and some turmeric as well
@shrek2be broccoli, onion and garlic

Any Arsenal fans actually planning on watching the Utd game?
I didn't understand minute steak until just now. Lawd
@CmonHarris but yes, if you can, try as much Sri Lankan food as you can! I think it's beautiful!
@CmonHarris hahaha ah I just meant we use a lot of garlic in our food, so she brought it over to British cooking too haha!
@CmonHarris ooft Damn.
@CmonHarris I thought mum used a lot of garlic when making roast, (from our Sri Lankan cooking), but 40 hahaha
@CmonHarris I just watched a video and it looks as delicious as it is decadent!
@CmonHarris looks amazing, what are those? I love your weekend food tweets hahah
@CmonHarris 40 cloves??
Jheez. How lame
@TheRegista_ further breakdown: I'd rather pragmatism (beat fullback, byline, cut back/cross) than someone trying to weave through defence
@TheRegista_ there's the magical, twist and turn style of Messi, or the direct dribbling of Robben, or the audacity of Ronaldinho (<PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>)
Think I ate like half a loaf smh
Sourdough <OK HAND SIGN>
Funny how things change - South Africa's greatest quality was once it's all-rounders, with its weakness probably in its top order.
@RoshCricket wow that's pretty sad, idk they should be respected nonetheless
Not looking forward to South Africa v Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals
@newschambers ohhhh oh right, yeah, massive final game now
@Kingkeir Yeah, I still think they're fantastic
I still won't write them off but honestly, these pitches should have given South Africa a huge advantage
Everyone had South Africa down as favourites for this tournament, yet they've managed to lose to both Asian sides in their group
Pakistan Zindabad!
Dil dil Pakistan!
Yes! Pakistan!
@j_hussain Kakmal is confused
Dil Dil Pakistan! Jan Jan Pakistan!
@newschambers I had no idea you had SA links! Nervy times now!
OMG FANTASTIC PAKISTANI BOWLING AND FIELDING
Pakistani bowling is so frustrating
@newschambers hahaha I'm quite torn but supporting Pakistan and de Villiers haha
Pakistani fielding is so frustrating
@Phaetonv2 I should ask you every Monday haha
@Phaetonv2 Makes me sad sometimes cos I don't get to watch much live football and rely on these guys to fill me in hahah
@Phaetonv2 yeah, even worse on podcasts where it becomes obvious that some aren't really thinking when they're watching
@Phaetonv2 dat ass
@MercurialRossi hahah aww
Unbelievable how much happier people are when the sun is out
Such a lovely spring afternoon
Lovely weather for patio cricket imo
Well.
Can't listen to the CL music without hearing 'brought to you by MasterCard... And Sony... official partners of the UEFA Champions League'
@judeinlondon it's like a 20 second sample smfh Handel
@judeinlondon haha! And yeah, I remember when I first found that out I was so gutted that it wasn't basically 15 minutes of the CL intro
@frnzd I can't criticise that kind of football though, if it wins you trophies
@frnzd hahaha, you hate Mourinho more than Utd?
@judeinlondon Didn't work... basically this - 
@judeinlondon spotify:track:3whSDGs4Jrq48RlJxE90g3
@judeinlondon Listening now! Mine is this! very obvious I guess... This reminds me of the CL and Ave Maria reminds me of Jerusalem
@judeinlondon I guess I'd have to try other composers out to be able to compare
@judeinlondon just dope track after dope track
@judeinlondon Ah okay, that makes sense - I think that I can relate to that. To me, because I'm just going through a playlist, it seems like
@judeinlondon That's pretty beautiful! Could you explain why that is? Haha, big ask, I'm sorry
@judeinlondon to play #AllDay on loop for a bit hahaha
@judeinlondon I learnt that his music is supposedly helpful when revising, so I thought I'd give it a shot and honestly I only stop
@judeinlondon yeah!
Can somebody explain what makes Bach the best? I like what I hear but I've nothing to compare it to
