@tregs100 @tregs140 what has happened to the team so far this year.poor performances so far,no middle order.shocked at tuesdays shocker.
@GFCCommercial @kirk_spence @eddy187 whos making the kit?
@SomersetCCC cant blame, any one on this.  Extremely poor batting.
@LeJeuAvantTout without your  hard work and the rest of the boards and mr kitchens  and many others,we may not have won anything this season
@hawkholland just wanted to let you know how the glentoran family have taken to you.after a shaky start since xmas,you have been awsome.
@BillyBlue_1886 you are always welcome.lol
@Glentoran many thanks to jodie and the team in the milk bar,for their hard work all year.many thanks and much appreciated.
@Glentoran just like to thank all the hard work by our club volunteers yesterday to make yesterday possible,not a pretty game,but we won.
@BBCSPORTNI he made the right call,seeing it in realtime.
@Glentoran feeling,proud, happy and optimistic that our great club,will be back where it belongs.bless  em all
@mcgibs_mike absolutely apalling behaviour by the 20 0r 30 fans who tried to get on to the pitch,part time stewards were brilliant though.
@tregs100 same old story,get onto a good position and crumble.
@yidarmyulster the europa league pay out is 145 k.we could end up with nowt.glenavon have shown character and bottle.
.
@yidarmyulster had europe within their grasp,but have shown no bottle since semi win
#piss poor.
@lurgan1889 well done Glenavon,when it mattered they rose to the task after the split,while others faltered badly#glentoran.
@BallybeenDC im still wondering the same,time for a,wee break.i have no confidence in him any more.
@BillyBlue_1886 sets the game up against the crues nicely for you.you never know?
@BillyBlue_1886 i think next season will be tighter, and you will be in with a good chance, as always.we need experience in defence.
@BillyBlue_1886 yes probably dont see what someone does,until theyre not there to do it.
@BillyBlue_1886 whats been the missing cog for the blues this season,in your opinion.
@BillyBlue_1886 i dont rate mackers but i really think ill change my opinion on that one.curtis is curtis ,good,bad and sometimes ugly.
@BillyBlue_1886 we were out muscled and outplayed all over the pitch.
@BillyBlue_1886 really cant complain,we we over powerd in midfield and had nothing up front.we are where we are and thats 6th place.
@BillyBlue_1886 penalty for defo,good header from haughey but he was not challenged.just determined like the rest of his team.
@Bezziekiller well played tonight,thought you were awsome and the best team won.thats hard to admit,but its the truth.well done.
@Glentoran forget about the performance and lets say thanks to our Ruth who got a token of our appreciation before kick off.thank you # star
@Glentoran @JRF1882 we didnt throw it away.the better team won by a mile.
@Linfield_FC @statoblue sorry to read that tweet.no place in society for that.big glen had the last laugh.!!!
@girv1882 @yidarmyulster @StephenMcalorum agree,it lets him roam forward and he knows he has defensive cover.
@yidarmyulster @girv1882 @StephenMcalorum no pace either.gordon and nelson are like clones of mark clarke.
@BillyBlue_1886 to be honest we knew the outcome.every attack looked like wed conceed,but the two goals were poor ones to conceed.
@Francis_McCaff got what we deserved.we won nothing in midfield and offered nothing going forward.pish poor.could end season with nothing.
@BillyBlue_1886 i have been impressed by mr burns this season.i watched his brother @ dungannon and he looks a good one too.
@BillyBlue_1886 @Bezziekiller i think the better team won.from kick off the blues hussled and won every midfield battle and 50 50 ball.
@yidarmyulster @girv1882 caught wide open.we need two forwards harrassing their defence.
@yidarmyulster @girv1882 we allow teams to build from the back with that formation.it sucks our midfielders to their defenders and we r
@girv1882 @yidarmyulster true,but i detest the formation,as the extra midfielder gives us nothing extra.
@girv1882 @yidarmyulster morris should have got their second goal.no challenge from him.
@yidarmyulster @girv1882 i have never liked one up front from day one.i think it will cost eddie his job eventually.
@girv1882 @yidarmyulster i think eddie forgets johnny can play up front.anything would have been an improvement.
@BillyBlue_1886 @Bezziekiller thought he had a very good game.
@eastantrimglens @girv1882 @yidarmyulster sorry i thought the only bright spot was ruth getting her award before kick off.
@girv1882 @yidarmyulster yea probably right.just apalled by what o saw.garrett was a liability.
@yidarmyulster @girv1882 some players tonight proved to me they are not good enough.johny addis should have been on.centre halfs were pish.
@BillyBlue_1886 fully deserved.our young team were asked to stand up and be counted,but the blues were hungrier.won every 50 50 challenge.
@yidarmyulster @mcgibs_mike id have had mcullough on and kane into midfield.
@mcgibs_mike weak in every area.defence was truely awfull
@girv1882 @Glentoran it was spineless and gutless.no one has come out with any credit.truely awfull.
@mcgibs_mike mckee was truely awful.
@mcgibs_mike this was a test to see where we are,and we failed miserably.
@mcgibs_mike defence and midfield and forwards were absolutely terrible.no hunger or desire.should have been beaten by more.
@BillyBlue_1886 justice was done.better team by a very long mile!!!!
@Glentoran shocking from start to finish.no one can take any credit from that.defence and midfield were truely shocking.
@Glentoran shocking goal to concede.its been comming.young players asked to step up and arnt ready
  #Good…
@Glentoran will the collection for the fine still be in operation on Tuesday night, and if so where abouts,so I can chuck a few quid in.

Tweet us &amp; @Glentoran with your correct score prediction for today's Glens match

Must FOLLOW both, RT &amp; use…
@HoltChris @TelegraphSport great news,hes a liability at premiership level.
@lurgan1889 and i know what you want the result to be lol.
@Glentoran the cup final shirt is like the performance yesterday,pretty darn special.love and bless em all.
@Glentoran canny wait to see and buy my cup final top.as im only on earth once, i want to spend it supporting the  cock and hens.#love em.
@BBCSPORTNI lets hope kevin learns and stops bowling short long hops every ball.
@Georgegray2015 great debut last night young man,some lovely crosses into box second half.well done.
@BillyBlue_1886 not quite perfect,the crues won again.but enjoy your feed.
@lurgan1889 long old jaunt if you loose.lol.pitch is just like a cricket square.
@lurgan1889 it is extremly painfull to watch us struggle to create,and have no bodies in box when we attack on the counter.
@lurgan1889 you go and enjoy.normally id be envious of some one going to old trafford,but after that last night,could be squeaky bum time.
@tregs100 its pure rubbish and extremely hard to watch.could be embarrassing with fixtures that are comming up.
@williegarrett2 you would have needed a snorkle to run down the left hand corner second half.congrats on new contract# well deserved.
@BallybeenDC we owe them more than one.
At least its not being played on the hockey pitch.
@DgnSwifts good battling performance on a tricky pitch.good luck for the rest of the season.
@neiley2 408_5 sounds more like a ciyms thirds or fourths score.lol
@Glentoran great win for seconds last night.seen worst penalty decison in over 35 years of watching football.well done the wee glens.
@petergfc i think thats being kind.colly smith looks a good one,and george gray looks good on the ball.jinkys going backwards.
@petergfc 1_0 to us.jinky has just scored.coleraine are joint top of league with swifts.most of this team just out of nappies.
@petergfc watching browne and misky play for coleraine reserves tonight at oval.another waste of two shirts.lol
At oval tonight watching two ex glens and blues centre forwards,playing for coleraine reserves.gary browne and misky.they havnt lost it.lol
@BillyBlue_1886 @grantmccann11 and he also scored for his boyhood club#lived the dream.good luck!!!
@Ross__92 hows ralph getting on in the house.
@Ross__92 im drinking morgans and fanta and would love a finisher for our beloved glens.lol
@Cheesewright3 he is young and learning,i hope he is given his chance,he has pace,skill and is a good finisher.
@Cheesewright3 yes but that was because he never stops running and not giving defenders time.i dont know what he did wrong to not start.
@Cheesewright3 @glentoran99 we have watched this one up top for three years now,and i can say it has been pure and utter shite to watch.
@Cheesewright3 @glentoran99 curtis or young Danny arnt one up top players.its to much to ask.we need a physical presence who can finish.
@Cheesewright3 @glentoran99 if we seen any difference with runners comming into box from midfield it would be worth it.but we dont.
@BallybeenDC yea thats why we are in fifth place.all eleven players rarely perform week in week out.#not good enough.
@CrusadersFC well done today.hope u go on and win the gibson 
@tregs100 yes,mata and wilson need games.really making hard work of getting fourth place.
@Neil_GFC i hope so,another day like two years ago would be brilliant.
@Neil_GFC we had a chance for european football.should that not be motivation enough for the players.not hungry enough in every aspect.
@Neil_GFC need a forward who will cause defenders problems with his physical presence.allen is a fairy who chance per goal ratio is poor.
@lurgan1889 the two glens,one cant defend and the other cant score.and utd well thats another sorry one.youll need another chineese  tonight
@lurgan1889 yea but crues have quality to punish anybody.heatley is a matchwinner and his pace is lethal.they deserve the league.
@DarrenGibbons91 @bangorfc great race developing between top 
@lurgan1889 and use that word again for utd,pathetic.lol
@lurgan1889 big gap in quality developing in irish league.if we conceded seven id be calling for managers head.
@tregs100 no they havnt improved,certain players have got worse,forwards especially.
@SirAlexStand can he keep on for good may improve his game.#useless
@BBCSportsound glentoran going backwards.no cutting edge up front.poor season and poor suffering fans
@Glentoran european football a dream for another season.hunger and desire missing against a young coleraine team.need a finisher  badly.
@Bet_McLean @Glentoran 2-1 glens
@CrusadersFC good luck today against glenavon.great result last night.great goal by no pace jimmy to help you.lol
@tregs100 think we dream of a rooney hatrick tonight,probably more realistic.lol
@tregs100 and your bro drafted in late to englands world cup squad.#great evening.
@Francis_McCaff only consolation is we won the game,and we can now suffer the tiredness a wee bit better.great team performance by all.
@Glentoran super win tonight.hendo,johny and c max were fantastic.great all round team effort on a bitterly cold night.
Well done.
@BallybeenDC yes he knows the bubble is bursting.we should have beaten them last week as well.
@lurgan1889 had the same feeling after bangor dumped us out of co antrim shield.#wonderful game.
@lurgan1889 yea,like the other top teams in league,crammed with experience and quality finishers.always going to be a tuff place to go.
@lurgan1889 no irish cup and possibly no european footy ,dressing room at tillysburn may have already been chilli after game.#irish cup.
…
@Bet_McLean is our current team progressing as well as you would have hoped this season.
@eddy187 @Glentoran @NIFL_Football would find balls if it were the blues me thinks.
@sid1882 thats not the reds team of the last two years.seen them three times against us this season.#Buble is bursting.
@sid1882 i thought we created nothing first half,calamity goal we gave them.second half with a natural goalscorer we would have won.#proud.
@Glentoran great second half today.absolutely battered the reds goal.deserved all three points.
@sid1882 same place as their title hopes.dissapearing by the week.
@Glentoran pure and utter rubbish.nothing upfront.

@SirAlexStand should have got him when he was leaving palace
He was outstanding the night they beat us in the league cup.
Absolutely apalling the way certain players,yourself included are treated and told to go.whether u want to or not.
@Ross__92 im the same.hearing big jay on way out,has,zapped my strength.bed in 10 mins.

And turning up for games.
@Ross__92 this has been festering for some time,going back since last season.just doesnt see eye to eye with eddie._wonder why.
@BillyBlue_1886 I was down to moyola park earlier in season and was mighty impressed with facility's and running of club .
@ShawCoard @Bman1882 my thoughts exactly.
@ShawCoard @Bman1882 i have my doubts that hell stay,looking more money.if he goes i wouldnt miss him.rather have youngster playin for shirt
@ShawCoard @Bman1882 yes experience and eddies trying to convince the board hes worth a three year contract.sorry i dont think he is.
@ShawCoard @Bman1882 yes and he has more potential to score.did u see mackers efforts today.#embarrassing.
@ShawCoard @Bman1882 yes possibly.personally id  bring in young nelson to beef the midfield up a bit.first half today we were out muscled.
@Ross__92  hope u gave him some east belfast hospitality at your gaff after the game.lol
@Bet_McLean @Glentoran 3_0 glens
Very confident.
@BillyBlue_1886 enjoy the game today
Should be a comfortable win.but u never know.
@ScottHarkness7 yea scott brown and big ash taylor seem to have made a big difference.just need the second goal a bit quicker in games.
@ScottHarkness7 the dons are going well this year.a determination about them to grind out results.
@SkySportsNewsHQ i think some one with more experience may have been needed.the scottish premiership is really no yardstick to go on.

@NIFootballDaily @Glentoran it should say when glentoran get their three points for the ifa giving glenavon wrong information to play gary.
@lurgan1889 very very poor.extra man in midfield is making no difference.lucky they have nothing up front.
@ArdsFC1900 great strike from the big man.quality player who was shunned at the oval.good luck to him and to ards for saturday.
@AaronAgnew_ what a cracker!!could be in for a tight enough game on saturday.
@ColeraineFC great performance with such a young side.well done.
@jaddis11 and you are playing majestically in our defence.a young alan hansen,springs to mind.keep it up and well done.c.o.y.g.

#montheweeglens
@JordanStewart74 @NIFootballDaily Let's celebrate with a wee hatrick tomorrow.fully deserved.well done.
@Ross__92 Take it your feeling better.
@Glentoran amazing people.amazing club.glentoran until I die. C o y g.
@Glentoran  just watched the homeless appeal video on you tube.iwas close to tears.unbelievable the impact made to folk who have very little
@BillyBlue_1886 That's brilliant pal.being a glenman,I don't think I'll ever do that.lol

FAV = NO


@BillyBlue_1886 as hard as it is for me as a glenman to  admit i would say its very good reading- especially in nice cosy pjs.lol
@BallybeenDC he was only doing what our defenders have done all year.ball watch,give away a goal and then try to blame someone else.
@eddy187 @BallybeenDC if he goes walk abouts,then he will fit in well with our other defenders,as they go walkies every match.lol
@sid1882  i suppose if you had offered me 3 points from six before saturday,id have bitten your hand off.
@sid1882 yes you are right,just sick of our inconsistancy,and failure to beat the blues when they arnt much better than us.boxing day blues!
@sid1882 the manager is the one who is paid to win games.if we dont win games he is the one to blame.he is not a tactical aware.
@Bman1882 winning against institute and warrenpoint doesnt hide the fact we bottled it on boxing day once again!!
@Bman1882 you can ditch mackers,holland and hendo.not good enough to wear our beloved green shirt.thats only for starters.
@Bman1882 when we are asked to show balls on boxing day we cant.the hunger and desire to play for the shirt isnt there.# sad fact @ present.
@panda4gfc cant fuckin defend and take our half chances.defence is static to often.
@panda4gfc any other manager would have been sacked by now.7 defeats by new year.shite doesnt even describe it.
@panda4gfc sorry hendo too.
@panda4gfc couldnt agree more.take holland and mackers too.cant defend and tactics are shite.
@collyysmith you can guess what i think when he and his black labrador pass me.lol good luck.
@collyysmith big big game always.please do yourselves justice,as sammy mcfadden lives in my street.and see him every day when walking my dog
@collyysmith please please give them a game today as we are better than the last two hammerings suggest.c.o.u.g
@BillyBlue_1886  merry Christmas to you pal.been off twitter for a while,but back now.enjoy today and tomorrow. Fancy a draw tbh.
@BallybeenDC Sorry mate but, I read that out and we all laughed in tandom.have a good one.
@BallybeenDC That's a good plan.you will be able to retire in the new year then.lol,have a good one mate.
@Ross__92 You will be well practised by next year,so I would have plenty of faith in you.
@Ross__92 merry xmas.hope your mums cooking will be up to your high standards.have a good one.
@Bman1882 @BallybeenDC dougald mccarrison.
@BBCSPORTNI sorry mr breslin,but without mr boyce-you dont look the same team.not the same threat up front.teams arnt scared to compete now
@FBAwayDays thats quite sad.
@StevenGordon6 hard fought and deserved.great team effort.enjoy xmas and then enjoy winning at windsor.c.o.y.g
@Glentoran static defending once again.
@BallybeenDC hes his best mate!!
@Londonglen very very sad.when your manager thinks mackers carrys the team.he is a ball winer with average ability
@Londonglen cant see us getting anything tomorrow.sad to admit that we are lacking in quality-especially in defence.hope im wrong.
@Ross__92 this time next week you will be awake.and tucking in to mums breke.lol
Manchester United vs Liverpool: All the action from Old Trafford 
@TheWeeGlens @MoneyslaneFC good performance against a much more experienced team.well played and good luck in next round.
@SamBraik96 to the wee teams.that is the problem.we arnt good enough to beat the teams above us
Keep up the good work.
@SamBraik96 great article in gasette again young man.just couldnt work out why curtis said we beat the big teams and then will loose

@PabsWilson well done sir.great commentry.great performance.u r now our lucky mascot!!lol no pressure for next game!!
@Glentoran great performance today by the whole team.keep em vienna shirts.im not gurning today!!what a responce.well done.bless em all.
@PabsWilson good luck today pal.hope u  will be our lucky mascott-and help us banish tuesdays atrotious display from our minds.c.o.y.g.
@Ross__92 good luck with viewing!!
@Glentoran thanks for update on academy players.nice to hear positive stories after tuesday nights shocking display.futures bright!!
@Ross__92 yes to say it was grim is an understatement.it is sad and embarrassing!!
@Ross__92 good lad.did u watch that shite last nite.
@Ross__92 to the big view!!!
@BatchyFTB nothing worse!!you think of a sicky at work!!then struggle to get up.have a good day!!
@BatchyFTB im the same.couldnt get that shite last night out of my head.!!
@BatchyFTB @the_glenman hardly slept a wink last night thinking of how r great clubs is in such a poor state.going to e mail chairman today!
@BatchyFTB ok pal.i might be up half the night in annoyance.
@BatchyFTB never mind 30pounds a goal.scary!!!
@BatchyFTB thats what we are good at as a club.ruining our own talent.allen is a waste of a shirt.and doesnt deserve any payment.
@BatchyFTB eddy got mr holland as hes best buddies with him and it shows.i agree with you.im the same.it hurts like hell and will until sat.
@BatchyFTB the pitch in 2009 and big alan was getting booed when he lifted the gibson cup.thats our standards.we cant let them drop!!
@BatchyFTB i agree and feel your hurt and frustration but change has to happen if this shite continues.i remember walking onto
@BatchyFTB i agree 100% and no one wants to change anything.each season is worse than previous one.
@BatchyFTB this the problem-lack of admittance from the board.if we go to sleep the problem will have gone in morning-thats the mentality.
@BatchyFTB i have never liked him or his tactics and would have given him a one year contract as with many of his players.
@BatchyFTB @the_glenman henderson is not fit for the shirt.one of many.mckee should be on instead of fairyfeet allen.tactics are shocking.
@BatchyFTB @the_glenman still living on the lucky cup win.he cant live on that forcever.we are going backwsrds.his tactics amaze me.
@BatchyFTB i agree with your comments.im the same.its sad and embarrassing and time for change.eddies taking us backwards.
@the_glenman cheers speak soon.cant really be as bad on saturday- can it?
@Glentoran we exited without  a whimper as we havnt the required passion to do anything else but.
@the_glenman because there isnt much to remember about the present.ill b awake half the night now in annoyance!!
@the_glenman peter steele played for nowt.i honestly loosing faith with each passing season.thank godci can remember the past!!
@the_glenman i reckon a majority of our legends team could walk into our current team at present.
@the_glenman no one wants to come anymore in case they dont get paid!!!
@the_glenman weve got johnny addis and fairy feet allen.lol sad and shamefull.
@StevenGordon6 at least you cant be blamed for that embarrasment tonite.you didnt get on the pitch.lol
@the_glenman i agree entirely.a leader is a big requirement at present amongst other things .lol
@the_glenman i dont think anyone wants too-and that is more alarming.there is a sence of denial and has been for years.
@the_glenman other clubs like the crues and cliftonville are on the up and we are in freefall and in denial.!!
@the_glenman and no plan to get us out of this terrible situation.it hurts like hell.
@the_glenman i agree 100% on both points.but the sad point is there seems to be denial at board level of how bad things really are.
@the_glenman its not hard its painfull to take and it hurts inside,to see what a mess we are in as a club.tonite proved how bad we really r.
@the_glenman these players wouldnt be fit to wash any of the players mentioned boots.its embarrassing and sad at the same time.
@the_glenman its the worst team ive seen in 35 years.it hurts so much to watch this shite-thats what it is.its no longer entertainment.
@the_glenman this crap about being a young team.your either good enough to wear the shirt or your not.age is only a number.
@the_glenman you would have to go back to the bowers and nuts era !!shamefull it really is.
@the_glenman i really dont think they know what playing for the shirt means.theres no hunger or desire in any of them-so sad!!
@BallybeenDC yes i agree entirely.we never learn from our mistakes and tactics are so poor.players dont want it bad enough-bottom line!!
@glentoran99 it may a bit over dramatic yes-but im only saying how i see it after 35 years watchin the glens.maybe as bad as cassidy era!!l
@andyhall47 yes i agree but it annoys me to see talent not given a chance.good luck in next round.
@Neil_GFC brutal is being kind!!absolutely fuckin brutal more like!!
@andyhall47 @bangorfc well done young man.must be a good feeling as you were never given a real chance at the oval.well done!!
@bangorfc well done lads.well played and deserved.good luck in next round.out played and outfought a poor glens team.well dpne!!
@kirk_spence the whole team should be ashamed of themselves.we turn up each week with hope.now there is no hope-just players who are shite!
@Glentoran sorry but this is the worst team of all time.we are a laughing stock and cant do anything about it.
@BallybeenDC they did us cause they were hungrier than we were.we got what we deserved tonite.no player deserves to get paid after that!!
@BallybeenDC no hunger no desire no passion.shamefull performance.
@ExperianExperts is it worth getting a credit card to build credit.do these cards exist.
@ExperianExperts ive applied for a credit card and have been turned down as ive no ctedit .how do i rebuild credit history.
@Ross__92 yes but do they deliver?u arnt the steadiest on your feet most sunday mornings.lol
@Ross__92 whos going to feed u on sunday after your hangover now.lol
@kirk_spence i rant and i rave after defeats but were not that far away.another season for the young lads and a goalscorer and we wil b fine
@kirk_spence we lack a few things-but a leader would make a big difference to our young and inexperienced team.organisation is non existant.
@Ross__92 that made me laugh!!changed for how long-a week.whats the book called best hangover cures for next weekend.has your mum fed u yet.
@kirk_spence they will kick us bullie us and be up for it.it will be a test of our character.sadly i think we lack character.hope im wrong!
worst coleraine team in years and we couldnt beat them.spineless gutless and not good enough.paying peanuts attracts only monkeys.
@kirk_spence honestly think some of the legends would do better and be more passionate about wearing our shirt. at present.
@kirk_spence lets face it very few especially in the last two games deserve to b payed!!lol
@kirk_spence in our fragile financial position lets pay players performance related wages.then we would be in a better financial position.
We have no belief.we are as good as any.is it because we lack belief or experience or both.
@kirk_spence shit manager shit players.no desire for our beloved shirt.long season ahead.no change.going backwards.
@StrandburnPharm thanks for helping our wee team.i will be supporting u with my male grooming requirements. From now on.lol
@BallybeenDC i think its sad the way we roll over against the physical hoofers.curtis allen is a waste of a shirt.
@BallybeenDC another laughable performance against the hoofers.what do they practice at training pre match against the hatchet men.
@Glentoran big game-no bottle no desire-nothing up front.curtis allen is a waste of a shirt,never mind money.
@Glentoran woke up from a dream 
@Bet_McLean @BallybeenDC @Glentoran 2-1 glens.what do we think!!

@girvanwiltshire can you give me a contact number for yourself or stephen for joining club or for bus to away games.
@Francis_McCaff one word for last night.awsome.keep it going young man!!!
@BallybeenDC hope so mate.it hurts to see it.if take away hope and weve nowt.coyg.
