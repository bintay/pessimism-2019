Hope to have a husband as great as my dad one day.
So happy that my dad is in Florida with my grandma right now. <GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART>
I make sure to tell my mom the words "I appreciate you" everyday!
Made her breakfast, wrote her a poem &amp; she told me to keep making her and my dad proud. Happy Mother's Day everyday!
Well I went to Westfield lol. 
I don't care about the things the average teenager cares about.
Gonna give myself the world, because I deserve that shit!
Only person you can depend on when nobody is there, is yourself. Might as well start now!
I am literally my best friend, I'm the only person I can depend on for emotional support. I encourage myself everyday to keep going.
At this time, I'm leaving it up to God.
Not only I can do it, so can you. .
Life is so much bigger than me.
I'm focused on things bigger than me. I can't give up.
If you can't do it now, then make time to do it later! Never give up on your goals, we all have the ability to accomplish them.
Inspirational. We have the power!  
I'm okay. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end.
I have to remember there's always someone that has it worst than me. .
I'm going to work, until I get to where I want to be. No point in doing nothing &amp; complaining.
I work my ass off!! Should I expect a reward? Or is working your ass off already expected?
Sometimes I just be looking and think .... "Must be nice". <CONFUSED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Getting my cap &amp; gown this week, I just might scream from excitement!
Good day regardless. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@lilverooo yes, definitley!! It is only natural for that to happen. <RELIEVED FACE>
I don't understand some people lol.
For some reason I am very intrigued with Fetty Wap's tone of voice.

Guys who know how to dance have something special about them lol.
Omg. This is so cute<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>  
People need to learn to let go of other people's differences.Everybody isn't going to live up to ur standards. Just let people do them.
You can't pick and choose when I become important. .
If a face full of makeup makes you feel most beautiful...then wear it well babygirl, all girls should feel comfortable &amp; beautiful. Period !

I won't miss high school, idk why people tell me I will.
I swear my school wants to be so different and "unique" from the rest, but they just end up failing badly. <SKULL>
Don't get mad at a person who's a little louder than you, or a little wilder than you. That's just who they are, let them do them.
I'll never understand why people get mad at others for simply being themselves, when that's what society preaches us to do all the time.
It's a good feeling to know about the talented @chloeandhalle before they get super big <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>. U girls are about to BLESS the word with ur gift<GROWING HEART>

"If you believe the only purpose in life is to help yourself, then you have no purpose."
I will do great things, with your support or not.
With all the stress that occurs senior year, I could have chosen to give up. But I refuse to do so, because I know my blessings are coming.
I am so excited to attend my HBCU, being surrounded by black excellence is empowering. <CROWN>

It's soooo funny how all these internet people have "stans" and "fans" ....like who are you? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Their career consist of Twitter and Vine. <SKULL>
I've come to the conclusion that I'm not a young looking 18 year old, y'all just old ass looking 18 year olds, which makes me look "young".
This is what happens when hair becomes a "trend" when it was formerly used to uplift the natural state. Just let us rock our Afros in peace<UNAMUSED FACE>

Do some females really believe that "slut-shaming" is one of the worst problem women deal with!? What they say on ur Instagram/Twitter?!

@lilverooo yes girl. I can't tell you how many females have been complaining about the stress of prom and getting everything together.
@lilverooo seriously tho lol . Get to it !
@chloeandhalle I can't wait to watch you girls transform into amazing women &amp; artist. Congrats!
@lilverooo you should do it! Might turn into something bigger than that.
Omg. Beyonce really signed them to her new label! They're about to spread so much positivity on the new generation of music. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
It's never been cool to make someone feel bad about themselves, I was always the one that wouldn't laugh.
I love talking to people that will make me think. I don't want to spend time talking about other peoples stuff. Let's enlighten each other.
I live in the moment with the future kept in mind. I make sure whatever I do now, will benefit me years later.
You have to surround yourself around winners if you want to become one.
Wait..... That really happened to Chris brown? <CONFUSED FACE>
Not trying, just "being".  
I'll lose sleep to accomplish what I need.

@YungShaing haha, that's funny. Tell them to step dey game up! <SKULL> jk. I think that means u try to attract the most honest people.
Everything happens in a timely manner.<RELIEVED FACE>
It's like u don't want anyone to feel threatened by u, but you still want to attract certain people who have that fire &amp; confidence in them.
@NirvanaDreamsss I totally agree!  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> we just some stronggg women lol.
It sucks when confidence can lead to intimidation.I don't want anybody to feel uncomfortable with me but I DO want someone confident enough<CONFUSED FACE>
@NirvanaDreamsss hmmm, I feel you! I think that's what occurs with me too.
@YungShaing what did they say it is?
@NirvanaDreamsss what do you think it is?

I honestly don't understand how females were such high heels to the club. I can see myself being the girl coming to the club with sneakers<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@TrapxGOLD right! Cause prom was the last thing on my mind until I decided to go last minute, so I have no expectations<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> just gonna have fun
GET OUT 
Everyone has told me that prom is what you make it, so don't go in with such high expectations. Just try to make it the best. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I hate when people I just started hanging with start to act too comfortable &amp; try to say stuff or play around like we been knew each other.<CONFUSED FACE>
Anybody that can reach my level of silliness is so good in my book. I love to laugh.
Zendaya is literally me, I am literally her. Smh
I'm the type of person that'll hold ur hand through situations, but will not CARRY u (figuratively), we all got to get it on our OWN someday
@ellebeaute lol didn't meant to. I added those cause people tend to look at the negative side &amp; forget how were becoming the new innovators!
I feel like people have just recently adapted the words "melanin, woke, and slay" to their vocabulary. Cause y'all use it for everything.
Saw a tweet earlier saying "everyone at prom should leave, cause u slayed." 
SO prom isnt about having fun w/ others? 
My generation is filled with the most ego-filled, talented, creative, selfish, insecure, annoying, awesome, Internet addicted people.
@BeautysRaj you're welcome Miss, Jessica
Maybe y'all will listen to me when I'm a huge positive figure in the world. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
LIMITATION IS A FORM OF SICK IMAGINATION IN YOUR MIND. ITS NOT REAL UNLESS YOU MAKE IT REAL.
I've managed to have some what of a social life &amp; good grades in high school, with zero drama. Lol
The skin is glowing, the hair is shining, the teeth are white. Well then<OK HAND SIGN>  
The human mind is so powerful, why do people choose to develop such thing as limitation in them?
@Nelle_101 I'm majoring in public relations, but I'll be studying everything.
I literally make my major decisions off the question "why can't I?" 
NOT "Can I?"  . .
The only reason why you think you can't do something is because of your mindset. Nothing else is stopping you, but yourself.
When people realize that life is not about following a journey accepted by others, but creating your own journey.
This is probably the best Gif I've seen in a while.  
I've honestly never felt comfortable with calling someone ugly just by their physical appearance.My mind always goes further than the looks.
Can't wait to meet like minded individuals such as myself. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️ life is just gonna get better and better.
I really hate when people interrupt my thinking. If I'm sitting quietly, there's usually nothing wrong. I'm simply having  deep thoughts. <WEARY FACE>
Writing for me is like a mental relief, I have millions of thoughts passing through my mind every second of the day, it can get too crowded.
If I am slacking in anyway, I'll mentally let myself know. But it's always nice to have honest people around u that'll let u know wassup.
I'll be the first to call anyone out, including myself. <SKULL>
I put myself first, I have to make sure I am good first... so I can be good for everyone else.
I am the type of childish that'll make you laugh and want to make friends with. Not annoy and make people mad.
We are spiritual beings. The most important thing is BEING. Be here &amp; Be in the moment.
We are all teachers in somebody's life, we learn from each other everyday.
Everything does not need to be understood, certain things you have to let go &amp; be okay with not understanding.

Sometimes I have the urge to say shit &amp; question other people. But then I remember that THEY'RE THEM &amp; I'M ME. So I just let them do them. <RELIEVED FACE>
I refuse to let my eating habits get horrible when I go to college. Not happening.
Does anyone else get annoyed by one person &amp; feel annoyed/irritated for the rest of the day? Like, you don't wanna be around any humans. <SKULL>
Omfg omfg, I envy the people who don't know who the Kardashian's are, I'm so tired of society bringing their name up.
It's a lot about who you know. .
I plan on creating great new relationships in this new chapter of my life.
Keep people around with the same vision as you. Hungry for success &amp; ambitious. No time to be wasted when u can be building something great.
I don't need anymore friends, I already have like two. .
I've only invited positive people into my life.
My goodness. Sometimes I love the internet because of these reasons. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>   
Everyone's worried about how everyone else is living &amp; it's so annoying. Keeping up with somebody else's life instead of focusing on yours.
Officially done wasting time and energy on people that don't even do the same for me.

Always look at the bigger picture or you'll become apart of the picture.
Think it's all fun &amp; games now. Go ahead &amp; invest so much time on here to become a social media personality, &amp; FALL SHORT IN REAL LIFE.
It's starting to feel like some of y'all appreciate online acknowledgment MORE than REAL LIFE acknowledgment, YOUR LIFE IS NOT ONLINE BTW.
Some people really need to unplug in order to face reality. Because Twitter &amp; Instagram have some of y'all on a DIFFERENT PLANET.
WAIT WHAT. I DIDN'T KNOW ZENDAYA WAS GIVING SIDE BOOB. 
Internet access &amp; social media can either help or hinder our society. Please stay aware.
I just wish people were more chill &amp; understanding. Stop thinking u have to be better than somebody else, or everyone has to be just like u.
Social media has created unrealistic standards for some people.Stop acting like ur bettter than somebody because of the amount of like u get
I wish people would put their ego aside more often, &amp; really try to listen what somebody else has to say. Let them explain whatever it is.
I will try my hardest to understand where a person is coming from, before I judge them BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH.
Embrace the open-minded, nonjudgmental people of the world. We need to spread more love &amp; practice understanding one another, not judging.
There's nothing more unattractive about a person who goes around judging people off of their looks, it's simply a bad character trait.
@getschooled @UniContigo #CollegeSigningDay my grandma is happy because she is an alumni of my future college, I wanna make her proud!!!

My prom dress is yellow, so I definitely approve of Rihanna's message. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@getschooled @UniContigo I don't need a college education, I WANT one. Help me pursue that by getting this scholarship. #CollegeSigningDay
@getschooled @UniContigo I think what you guys are doing is AWESOME, it'd be even more awesome if I got the scholarship<SMIRKING FACE> #CollegeSigningDay
If life was really all about money, we'd enter this world with it..
My goal isn't to get a lot of money. My goal is to positively impact people's lives, and erase limitation from society.
Money is such a small part of creating happiness, when you don't focus on it you realize how beautiful life is without it too.
I CHOSE my life, I will not settle for less. This life is mine &amp; I WILL live it the way I create it.
Life is full of opportunities, stop thinking you have to follow rules that were created by someone else. It's YOUR life.
@getschooled @UniContigo #CollegeSigningDay waiting for the day y'all announce the scholarship winner, hoping its me. 
@getschooled @UniContigo #CollegeSigningDay  more money = less problems !! This scholarship would be a blessing.

High school went by very fast. I remember what I wore the first day of school freshman year.
And then get on their cellular devices like there isn't real people in front of them. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I wonder if people will actually dance and socialize at my prom. People of this generation just like to get cute &amp; post pictures online.<CONFUSED FACE>
I love my body and feel blessed to be in it. Butttt, I want to take my fitness to a different level, not satisfied yet.

This whole summer I'll be working. Only time I'll take a break is when we go on family vacations. .
I love summer, I love the heat. I love  how warm my face gets and I LOVE the chocolate coat my skin gets because of the sun.
Guys who depend on "likes" and follows are so unattractive. Why are you spending so much time trying to become Instagram famous? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><CONFUSED FACE>

Lol I love my black people!We take just about every opportunity &amp; turn it into a competition.Prom is like a competitive sport because of us<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Extremely blessed. .
Sometimes I wonder what I did to have a mom and dad like mine. That love me the way they do, a family that supports me the way they do.
@outsiders4lyfe I'm so proud of Shameik, like finally!! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Yusssss

I need to take senior pictures for myself.
Not saying your opinion doesn't matter, but I love myself too much to stress over someone else's opinion of me. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I feel like something great is coming my way, this month shall bring me great news. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I feel in my spirit, soul, and heart that my future holds great things! I am excited and ready for this journey of life!!
Last full month of school, I'm so happy ! Let's get these last few days over with. Class Of 2015  <GRADUATION CAP><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

Here's a reminder . . . I believe in YOU! 
@getschooled @UniContigo I'm going to an out-of-state college, more money is always helpful!! Florida A&amp;M university <SNAKE> #CollegeSigningDay
I've never spent the amount of time thinking about guys/relationships the way other girls do.I'm just focused on my personal growth in life.
A relationship of my own will come in time, so don't make the mistake in asking me who my "other half" is. <SKULL><SKULL><SKULL>
I don't believe it's ever too late to "get your shit together". I 100% support anyone that is trying to get their shit together.
If you don't like spending time on Twitter sharing information that your mind needs to release, write a post on your phone.That's what I do<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TrapxGOLD Ya nasty.
Couples- 
Idgaf about your relationship, stop posting videos of you kissing on Social networks. .
When I finally meet a bunch of other people who are like-minded, I will completely lose it. Lmfao
I get way too excited when I obtain knowledge that is very relevant and accurate in my life at the current moment.
The accuracy in this freaks me out. 
WOW. 
I really wish everyone the best. Why can't we all shine together? Why can't we all give each other a high five for killing shit?
When you reach your own happiness all you want to do is help other people reach their happiness too.
Lol, my mind is never on chill mode.
I walk around feeling complete bliss in a very calm manner.
I think my purpose in life is to erase all limitations in humanity.
"You are the universe but society teaches limitation."
I never vision myself with one career, living in one place in the world, with one group of friends. Life is bigger than that . .
I need people to know that they are in control of their life and because of that, they can accomplish anything they want.
Be your own support system with mental support. Think positive, vision the future you want, speak what you want, and it shall manifest.
These next few years experiencing college/entering the adult life.
I will have to depend on myself more than I have ever done so in my life.
Ive spent so much time alone and in my thoughts. . .   The trust I have in myself makes me feel so content.
Losing my mind is the worst thing that could happen to me tbh. I love it so much.
I've learned and realized at a very young age that the only person you have to depend on &amp; trust is yourself. Everything comes from within!
I think self conversations are very important.
I'll never conform to a certain title because I hate being labeled and limited.
I love the way humans can express themselves in various of ways. I hate our obsession with acceptance and validation.
I spend so much time trying to understand other people. While I'm over here feeling like nobody understands me. It's quite frustrating.
FKA Twigs is slightly growing on me. . You have to have an open mind along with an open ear.
I don't trust people who rather listen to a lie before the truth.
@x_Fayeeeee__ oh yes, I forgot loll. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My only goal is to enjoy my senior prom, I'll be too focused on myself tyrna have a good time to see who is "slaying"
ain't no competition <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Prom is literally a competition to some people lol.
Hope I can find people similar to myself in college. It gets frustrating being surrounded by people who don't think on the same level as u.
Twitter is really like a whole new world for some people.
@_Kira_xo what is this?
Isn't it funny how people can follow up with your life on social media for a little bit and think that they know you.
I spend my time trying to understand people instead of simply disliking them. . If that makes sense.
Meditation and positive thinking works  . .
"When I accept myself, I am freed from the burden of needing you to accept me."
Senior year is truly something else. <FACE MASSAGE>
Everybody wants to be right in order to prove someone is wrong, but NOBODY wants to ask the question "WHY?!" and seek understanding.
I wish the Internet would stop working for everybody, so we could see how the Twitter activist would occupy their time "enlightening" us.
I care so much about everything, I begin to get frustrated because I don't know how to help everything.
People are waiting for others to stand up and do something as if this isn't their world too, BE the change or simply don't complain.
Don't choose a side, choose understanding !!  #BalitmoreRiots
People need to do less judging, and more loving.
"Treat people the way you want to be treated" is a golden rule!
The way someone treats others tells me a lot about that person.
"Less relationship goals more self goals."
@_Kira_xo girl I got you. <WINKING FACE>
@_Kira_xo May 16th
God works wonders through me, forever grateful.
After being on the search for only one day, I already have my perfect dress. I guess it's meant for me to go to my senior prom. <YELLOW HEART>

@Nelle_101 @JforJASMINE_ iight you not getting it, agree to disagree lol.
@Nelle_101 @JforJASMINE_ I understand.I just feel like there is a lot of ignorance behind that statement because most people don't even try.
I don't appreciate Twitter taking my "quote retweet" option away.
@Nelle_101 @JforJASMINE_ that's almost an oxymoron. Saying your natural born hair, isn't for "you". Who else could it be for then? Lmao
@Nelle_101 @JforJASMINE_ But there is no such thing as "not for everybody" when talking about the hair you were BORN with.
@Nelle_101 @JforJASMINE_ you can say the same thing for relaxed hair/ weaves. Its all about preference
A lot of people looked the same for prom this year. So many people with those mermaid dresses &amp; two piece outfits.

I'm actually surprised at August posting that video on Instagram, the way he speaks about social media... Just doesn't seem like him at all.
@SadariBanks @AugustAlsina thank you, and same to you. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Do not confuse a girlfriend with a mother, those are two completely different positions in a persons life.

@maninyee I have to see you when I go to Atlanta ! When do you start college?
Woke up today and wrote this small poem, just wanted to share some encouraging words. @AugustAlsina 
So grateful for the black women that have come before me &amp; paved the way for black girls to achieve their dreams.  #BlackGirlsRock
"If you can be black and live in this world, you can be anything you want to be."
Truly nothing better than seeing a strong black family together, no matter if it's two parents or one, the home is what's important.
Michelle Obama is not only the First Lady..She is also BLACK &amp; rocks! She spoke through the TV &amp; said she believes in us all, how inspiring.
I think it's time for a Twitter fast!
Yo... let me know when all that hating gets y'all a job and payed.
There's absolutely no reason a person should have that much hate in their heart for somebody you don't know. That's sick !
Like you have toooo much time on your hands to talk shit every time that girl Karrueche speaks her mind, get over it dude.
Yup.Some of yall are obsessed with Karrueche, u choose to point out her flaws, question her, &amp; belittle her.BUT claim u don't care bout her?
You can defend someone without slandering others. When you bring a person down while you try to bring someone up, I look at you just as bad.
Sometimes I wish all the hate could be wiped from the world, but then I remember life wouldn't be balanced. <CONFUSED FACE>
Damnnit. Will the black vs. White thing ever end?
HAHAHA . . . I have to get out of America before I go mad.
Now darker skin is being embraced and even admired, the melanin is finally being accepted one step at a time. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I remember when some black people use to be afraid of being out in the sun too long because they would get too "dark".
Black people are the center of America, what would this country be without US?
Kylie Jenner is just one of those people you gotta pray for.
@SylviaKaye49 agree to disagree, it's happened so many times with groups already, an Camila already has rumors.
@SylviaKaye49 I don't doubt Normani's success tho.
@SylviaKaye49 eh,with the looks of it Camila would be better.The connections she already has (T swift) her favoritism &amp; relative personality
I won't be surprised if Camila is the first one to leave the group and killlll as a solo artist. Sorry
Camila's unique voice gives me chills and makes me cry sometimes. <BLUE HEART>
When Jesus say yes, nobody can say no. <DANCER>
@MikaylaBeBallin aye! Did you go to prom,
When your school is really strict with clothing so you have to be extra careful with the prom dress you buy .
Common courtesy should never get old. Always say "thank you" &amp; "you're welcome" AND "Excuse me", "yes ma'am, no ma'am" "No sir yes sir" etc.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste!
I really believe humans can be the super humans that we imagine, it's possible.
Humans are extraordinary beings, we can do some amazing things with our bodies &amp; mind. We just have to have the focus to unlock the power.
@_xMiyahhhh you look good!!
There are things you just can't control, so you have to let it go &amp; let the universe deal with it.
I'll buy this for my damn self, where the store at. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@SylviaKaye49 no, don't be like that. Give her the benefit of the doubt, <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> maybe she was confused.

Genius! Bright colors look the best on darker skin tone.
I feel like all of this "exclusive" stuff on Tidal will end up on YouTube anyways, soooo.
@lilyungin__ na, can't be the same person.
When your sole purpose in life is to ONLY make money, u lose focus on what really matters in life.Relationships, helping people &amp; happiness.
Most people who choose majors that claim will make them "a lot of money" don't know how many years it truly takes to have that money add up.
The money is a given, enjoying your time &amp; having happiness is a choice.
There's positions in life for everybody, learn yours.
What you major in is not the only way that can provide you money, you can have jobs on the sides and still do what you love.
I refuse to major in something that is solely to make me money. As long as I am doing what I love, and doing it WELL, the money will come.
Limitation creates losers. If you have a dream, you better turn it into your reality!
People act like once you get a job as an adult, that's the only thing you'll be able to do with your life forever. That's not true!
Take a bike ride everyday, do a little yoga, mediate &amp; drink a lot of water.
This summer is about to be so nice. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> positive thoughts.
One of these days you're going to have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.
I'm going to remake my famu19 Intro video lol.

Humans go about life feeding off of each other's energy, whether you realize it or not... Positive energy can go a very long way.
It would be nice to have a national no service day.Everybody would prepare to talk to each other in person cause technology wouldn't work.
I have a great interest in humans and how we work, I just wish we all could work together more. .
I have a major problem with my generation feeling so comfortable with talking to each other online and not feel the same way in person!
I feel like my view on how the world is can be so small &amp; simple minded, cause I've never experienced life outside the U.S and it sucks.
I feel like until I travel outside of America, I will never truly know how beautiful life is.
Trying to imagine a world without social media, smartphones, and high technology is difficult. Cause that's what I remember, and it sucks!
People are fans of other people's life, more than they are a fan of their own.
I believe social media is one reason a lot of people have a huge ego now-a-days.
I always wonder what life will be like in 5 or 10 years, how humanity will change and how we will communicate with each other.

@_TonnieeLee_ what does that mean?
I don't appreciate how August eyebrows slays my own eyebrows at this moment.
People who complain about situations they don't try to fix amaze me in the worst way.
I like to challenge myself mentally since school doesn't do that for me anymore . .
Search for self-love not society's acceptance.
I want to make people feel understood &amp; appreciated. Be a person that people can go to for emotional &amp; spiritual support without judgement.
I really appreciate the people who don't hide their feelings.
I'll be the first to pop someone's ego bubble because I know they'll thank me later for it.
We all need each other whether you want to admit it or not. Don't let your ego ruin a great opportunity.
It's cute how people use social media to get their daily boost of confidence. Why else would likes &amp; favorites be so relevant to them?
A positive attitude truly changes everything.
People go on social media everyday to watch &amp; envy the life other people. Please stop craving somebody else's success and create your own.
Life will only get better if you do. .
You don't have to confront everything you don't like/disagree with. Sometimes it's best to let things go and let the universe deal with it.

It's so weird how people become fans of  other people's lives, why are u spending so much time rooting for another person in life?
In search of a mentor, in Oder to the be the best I have to learn from the best FIRST.
Next summer I plan on getting a job that only relates to my major in college. Why work at a store when I can learn more about my major?
I'm like a sponge when it comes to knowledge, I want all that I can get.
This new generation is something to look out for. .

If you take the opportunity to feel sorry for yourself, I won't feel sorry for you.

I really don't like letting people down, but sometimes you have to put your happiness first.

My confidence shouldn't make you uncomfortable.
One of my all time favorite quotes ! 
By Marianne Williamson <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
"Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so others won't feel insecure around you."
I never vision myself with riches, fame, and materialistic things. I vision myself with my loved ones, helping people, and traveling places.
I hate cell phones, I wish nobody used them so there would be no need for me to have one.
I'll be okay.
Life experiences, people, and love will bring me all the riches I need/want.
No money is that important to me.
The most valuable things in life is nothing that you can buy.
I feel like the future is going to hold the mentally strongest people &amp; the rest will be left behind. Because of programming &amp; unawareness.
I believe in humanity.
The worst thing someone can do is to try &amp; change the way someone looks at life. Humans are to embrace their different perspectives.
You don't have to be rich in money to travel the world, very few people realize this.
People are so judgmental off of the way others live its horrible. We are all one, we all need each other
I look at positions in life this way- if someone doesn't do it..WHO will? 
Janitors, garbage men, fast food workers.If they don't, who will?
Supportive surroundings are so important because there are so many people expecting you to fail.
I hate how people support those that attend school 4 an extraordinary job title, but give no attention 2 students who are into the arts etc.
@lilverooo my pleasure and I really appreciate that! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@lilverooo thank you !! I wish y'all the best.
I'm living in the moment, but I'm working for the future. Everything I do now, I make sure will benefit me somehow in my future.
Senior year should be fun, and reflective. You should be able to look back and realize the growth &amp; progress you've made!
Stop thinking about temporary success and focus on what you can do NOW to help you succeed in the future, in college and in ur career.
Start visioning how you want ur senior year to turn out. Work hard your first semester because that's the only one that'll change your GPA.
Shit gets real after high school. There's nobody to force you to do anything or go anywhere. It's simply your choice. The future is yours!
Juniors -
Senior year goes by fast af, it doesn't even make sense how fast. People will tell you this, believe them &amp; make it worthwhile.
@JusTreyAug happy birthday !!
Summer time is grind time &amp; I can't wait. <MONEY WITH WINGS><FLEXED BICEPS>

You are beautiful, you are fine, and you are a boss.
@ellebeaute it's sad, social media doesn't help either because they see the attention specific females get &amp; question their own beauty smh.
I don't understand how people hate other people when they're simply being themselves. How do you hate on someone that's just doing them? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Just because you don't get a lot of attention from guys, doesn't mean you aren't beautiful.
Still waiting on my bff to slay me with her prom pics. <WEARY FACE>

It's the little things that make me smile. Seeing the beautiful sky, getting a cute meaningful compliment, or hearing a baby laugh.

This is SO important. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><CROWN> 
It's so easy to be negative, but it's so worth it to be positive.
You're as ugly as you think you are, and as beautiful as you believe you are.
People want to act grown when it's time to have fun, but not when it's time to gain responsibility. <CONFUSED FACE>
I appreciate the people who believe in me now, and I appreciate the people who will start to believe me in after they see me succeed.
I question everything, because there's always more to learn.
I basically had two weeks of spring break, I'm blessed.
I live in a generation where they confuse lust with love, feelings with weakness and emotion with sensitivity. We have to stop.
Why is the thought of relationships so popular, but the thought of love, patience &amp; understanding even more unpopular?
"Don't be offended this is all my opinion, ain't nothing that I'm saying is law."
We determine who we socialize W/ online by the amount of likes/followers they have or by their looks.That's why "cat fishing" is so popular.
We spend so much time on social media with high expectations of people's appearance rather than people's personality. It's like a contest.
I feel like my generation is more judgmental than normal.
I want friends. Real friends that inspire me, and I inspire them. Friends that look inside of you, not outside of you.
I'm really close to myself, even when I'm alone, I don't feel lonely. My spirit is enough company.
Isn't it crazy how in this day and age, people judge other people by what they see online, rather than what they see in person.
I vision myself places before I get there, I claim it before I receive it. The secret of having it all, is believing you already do!
I am so excited for new beginnings.
I trust myself enough.
Who would keep a profile if their pictures received zero likes/comments? Nobody. .  I see it all the time. You care about what others think.
My generation goes to social media for validation and acceptance.
Money can't buy me the best things in life.
Summer is grinding season, no time to slack off before college.
The difference between winners and losers is their focus.
I like to be in control.
My sister is perfect in my eyes, such an inspiration.
Time flies man, enjoy every second of everyday. Do not wait to make yourself happy
Looking through all these Prom pictures. <CONFUSED FACE> wish I had people to go with, good thing I was never too hyped about it.
I don't understand how people go out of their way to insult someone or make them uncomfortable. . It's so uncalled for.
I hate when people text me with emojis during the whole conversation.
The best things in life are free. .
I really appreciate the support I have down here in Florida, my family is the best. Famu is the school for me, &amp; I will make them all proud.

I love you Florida.
I smile at the people who doubt me so they'll remember that smile when they see me succeed.

There is no friend zone.I'll never lead someone on, either I was never interested in u in that way or u looking for something I won't give.
Holding your pain inside is probably the worst thing somebody can do to themselves. Discussion is key.
@lilyungin__ lawddd! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> That makes sense. What time is it over there?
Encouraging others will not only uplift that person, but will unconsciously do the same for you.

<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> August is sooo childish.
I hate how money is such a big deal to people.
You really need to wake up if you think money and fame is what makes people successful.
I view wealth as the kind of people Im surrounded by, the career im working in, &amp; the level of happiness I have. Not by the amount of money.
I hate how people relate everything with twitter. What you see on here doesn't always equal to what's happening in the real world.

It's actually sick how some of yall compare celebrities pain to one another. No matter if they advertise it or not. These people are humans.
Understanding is probably the most important thing about any relationship between humans.
I know for a fact that every human wants to be loved and accepted in some way, shape, or form. Some just show that differently than others.
It's like all the hate and betrayal becomes normality, and the natural reaction is for them to post it online. It's dehumanizing. <CONFUSED FACE>
@bailinicole the black is really nice on you:
Never understood why celebrities do this to each other. Why hurt one  another &amp; advertise it? Forget the money, its ok to be a normal human.
Sometimes I really worry about society. People complain about having privacy, but turn around &amp; advertise their life on the Internet.
Sorry... But Karrueche seems like the type of chick that'll complain about how she hates drama, but will be the first one to entertain it.
"Surround yourself with people that reflect who you want to be and how you want to feel, energies are contagious."
Yup. This totally made sense. <CONFUSED FACE>

Everybody's present actions are triggered by past experiences.That's why I try not to judge, because there's a reason for everyone's actions
It's hard to judge somebody when you know there's a reason they are acting that way.

"Black is beautiful" isn't said to be better or feel better than anyone else, it's to deprogram ourselves into thinking we aren't as good.
My pride as a black person does not equal hate or shame toward other races. My pride as a black person is self-love, something we all need.
Black pride isn't something that was created recently, it's been going on since the days we were taught to be ashamed of the skin were in.

@Nelle_101 I read your bio lol.
Whenever people debate about HBCU's &amp; PWI's they are speaking soley from their experience. That's why you shouldn't group them all into one.
@Nelle_101 well that's good, you're speaking specifically about BSU right?
@Nelle_101 awesome! How do you like it?
@Nelle_101 I am. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
It's interesting to see the debate over HBCU's Vs. PWI's because just a few years ago, I thought of college as  just a SCHOOl nothing more.
I feel sorry for the people who haven't been outside of Texas before.
Wowwowowi I can't wait to spend my free time traveling.

It must've been an amazing experience being apart of the crowd that walked across the bridge in Selma.
I know I have to experience the LOW in order to live in the HIGH. My "struggle" will be treated as a come up, only preparing me for better.
Its not a small world, Its a big world, we are all just more connected with each other than you think.
Grateful for my parents seeing my vision &amp; letting me go to the college I want.People are doubting me &amp; they're letting me prove them wrong.
Once you stop learning, you stop growing.
@azileelareuse thank you very much!
Most of the top successful people in this world have had a mentor. They've followed and studied the best which have made THEM the BEST.
@azileelareuse Florida a&amp;m
You must follow in order to know how to lead.
College years is the best time for me to really invest in myself &amp; my career. I want to be around the best, and learning from the best.
It's becoming the time in my life, where I learn how to follow. I want a mentor, I want to intern, study &amp; work for the BEST. Follow to lead
I am so excited for college. I can't wait to learn new things and meet new people.
My family is like the dream team, we all hustle and grind on our own just so we can succeed together.
When I go off to college I want my parents to take these years to focus on themselves and hustle toward what they've always wanted in life.
Don't take me too seriously, but tske me seriously. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️

Everyone going to school tomorrow and I'm on spring break like. 
Be nice and cordial to everyone u meet because you never know if you'll need them in the future. We all use each other and help one another.

If someone Is doing good, they wouldn't spend time focusing on what others are NOT doing... Well, that's me at least lol.
Bragging on yourself is cool sometimes. But, questioning everybody else's actions in life doesn't make you any better.
I love people who laugh at everything like me, no time to be frowning or mad lol.
My best friend is so beautiful.
Jamie Foxx needs to put out some more music tbh. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I want to make people's lives better, I wanna be the person that helps others find their purpose In life.I want everyone to know their worth
Materialistic things don't compare to the gifts the Earth has to offer. The world is so beautiful.
I don't want fancy cars, expensive jewelry, or a huge house. I want to travel the world, experience different cultures, &amp; try new food.
For now on, any online shopping I do will be toward a black owned business.
I'm not going to pretend like I don't deserve better.
Growing a love to read more because I know it'll help me grow.
To be successful you must invest time in yourself, trust yourself, and take risks. .
A little faith can take you a long way..
When I grow faith and confidence in something, there's no changing my mind. I can do ANYTHING with the power of faith and determination.
I am good. I got this. I am confident. I have faith.
Everybody feels like they need to tell ME what I should do after high school. This is MY time to make decisions for myself.
I appreciate everyone's advice and opinion, but I I don't appreciate the people that try to convince me I am doing something wrong.
I believe in myself enough for everybody else. .
"To those sleeping on me...

You gon be so upset when you wake up."
People that doubt me add fuel to my fire. They add to my purpose, and inspire me to grind harder. My success will be a proving point.
No matter what you do, how you do it, or why you do it. People will hate. 

So whatever you're going to do.... You better do it well !
"To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.”
People are just as happy as they make up their minds to be.
Now-a-days it's so much easier to hate on people, rather than congratulate people. It's quite shameful.
I'll never hate on somebody else's success, we all deserve to shine at one point in time.
Everybody's grind is different, everybody has a position in this world. Just because others may be different than urs doesn't make it wrong.
If you spend time hating on somebody else's grind, you lose time to focus on yours. Let them hustle!
"Girls fight &amp; compete, queens empower &amp; uplift."

Here's to the women/queens that do not hate, but congratulate.

“@zellieimani: Twitpic yourself doing something outside stereotypical notions of Blackness.  #BlackOutDay” 
I am tired of people shaming those that decide to open up and share their traumatic experiences online. 
Just because someone choses to expresses their personal feelings ONLINE. . . doesn't make the situation LESS SERIOUS.
The worst thing you can do is destroy someone's mind.

When victims speak up offline, they're still accused of "want…

“@getschooled: <MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG> You know why I'm here #scholarships” 
When your goal is to not judge, but to UNDERSTAND people, you will automatically see the greater parts in everybody.
If it's ALL that they know, then the person won't be "wrong" in their head. Like their blind to the world, because it's all that they see.
I try my best not to judge others because sometimes the way people live their life is the ONLY thing they know.
Try your best not to judge, and try even harder to understand.

My pride as a black person is not meant to bring down other people.It's simply to celebrate myself and my people,my love doesn't equal hate.
Seriously praying for the black people who are hating on their own celebration. #BlackOutDay 
I really love the Internet and how, we as people can connect with each other from all over the world. This is something we should all value.
