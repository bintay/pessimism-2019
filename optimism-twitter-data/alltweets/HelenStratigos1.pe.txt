23 Brilliant Life Lessons From Anthony Bourdain 
@LouisaMcCormack My pleasure. Something new to try, yes? :)  Have fun!
@jm_mcgrath Ideally we'd have one fare covering region-wide transit throughout 416, 905, and GO system within GTA. Mega Presto card. #TOpoli
The #asianinvasion hashtag (pride in your roots, yourself, your unique beauty!) is simply awesome. :)
Once knew a brilliant person who, apart from devotion to The Secret, knew that road to happiness + success is to float above negative energy
Fates may be telling me it's time for a change of scene.
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar Perhaps my positive experience doesn't fit the Star's "divided city" narrative. Please don't neglect it, though
I find Raymond Cho's (suburban Toronto councillor) joyfulness &amp; positivity refreshing. Smiled at his 'everybody loves me!' upon re-election.
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar Appreciate that &amp; the art is wonderful. I think the story needs to be balanced by TTC facts, responsibly. #burb
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar Been getting around Toronto (particularly Scarb) by bus for decades, and some of these bus stories are unusual.
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar Perplexed by the anecdotes. Pls check TTC's bus schedule? Every 3-5 mins is the norm. Finch/Warden well-served.
Why are people lying? Or exaggerating? I've seen numerous Scarborough stories claiming buses 'rarely' come. Every 3-5 mins norm. Check sched
@tara_deschamps @TorontoStar This sounds strange. I live in Scarborough &amp; buses frequent. Ie Finch bus every 3 mins: 
@GTAMOVEnetwork @TOparksrec @JasonThorne_RPP @blogTO We're loving Milliken Park, and the north Scarborough Green Loop! :D
My favourite intellectual shows off her new frames!  What's the verdict? Fresh? Off to learn and invent things. :) 
@GTAMOVEnetwork @JasonThorne_RPP @blogTO I was being a little sarcastic (gorgeous trees/flowers everywhere in TO), but thank u for tips! :)
@JasonThorne_RPP @GTAMOVEnetwork @blogTO Honestly, is this the only place cherry blossoms have been planted in the entire city? Shame! More!
@TabathaSouthey I have several of those lovely loo-paper princesses. Portuguese mother-in-law. Staple in the home.
@dmrider While shadows are not ideal...there are many TDSB schools facing CLOSURE, which is truly troubling and a precursor to nhood decline
Hey, were you aware Aboriginal people here in Canada have their own channel (APTN)? Comedy, movies, news, documentaries...it's good. :)

@Albertanaviator @pmharper @noynoyaquino "Albertanaviator"? You're a sad excuse for a human being. Work to help TFW settle in,Prime Minister
@pmharper @noynoyaquino Please help temporary foreign workers gain a path to citizenship. Filipinos are assets to Canada and deserve better.
This is where largely Anglo/white editorial staff's notorious 'blind spots' irritate/anger/harm. Should be more worldly to work at TO paper.
If people seek jobs in wealthier nations that have labour shortages, their homeland is something to 'escape' from? It's '3rd world'? #expats
So, in trying to apologize for stereotyping all Filipinos in Nevada as nannies, the Star's public ed lays it on thick w/ '3rd world' crap.
@krushowy Thank you for clarifying! :)
Thanks @kathyenglish, but you mischaracterized Philippines as '3rd-world'. 1 of world's fastest growing economies: 
@angryasianman Whaaaat? Sick regressive backwater types.
@krushowy Hello Kristin! Does the work-to-rule / strike action include Catholic school boards as well? The news reports are unclear. Thanks!
What a nightmare to sit through. Pleading not guilty - Jesus H!  But justice must come.
Gotta feel for those reporters (thanklessly) covering the James Holmes trial (Colorado theatre massacre, 12 dead) while the world shrugs.
@EndEndoForever @CBCNews Agree 100%. These messages should be sent to the presiding judge!
@globeandmail May I suggest the writer spell out the acronyms? I know people in education recognize ETFO &amp; OSSTF, but general readers - no.
@CP24 @CTVToronto Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Toronto hosts dinner for Nepal earthquake relief 
@CBCNews It's not obvious that the answer is no?  The man cut someone's head off.
@CBCNews I see what they did there. #redshirts Memorable.
...Or writers who drone on about banal navel-gazing nothingness, seen as 'quirky' and 'real'. No. Offering nothing illuminating or elegant.
You know, the ones w/their own photo exhibits (probably run by a friend...). Photos devoid of artistry, character, interest. Emperor naked!
Knew many talented artists in HS in TO, now working in edu/banks/mgmt+ bc *money*. Cringe to see awfully UNtalented ppl lauded in arts scene
It's safe to say that approximately 92.5% of Filipina women I know are registered nurses. :D
Stunned by casual ignorance &amp; bigotry of intelligent people. Cdn journo says man who dug hole epitome of immigrants' achievements. Dear God.
@BuzzFeedNews Are complainers even remotely aware of the history of the United States? My goodness.
@amirightfolks Crucial issues that need action - would've made it easier to leave her abuser. cc @RathikaS 
@amirightfolks Yes - many victims like this. How to help women (esp. of precarious immigration status) come forward to report abuse? #VAW
Pandas! My kids are giving this precious bamboo plant to their Grandma for Mother's Day. :) 
A horrific case of abuse- story focuses on man's job: Pilot's conviction comes w/warning to Air Canada 
Aww...my little gardener "grew" me a plant for Mother's Day in her science + nature class. #ProudMama :) 

Decency, kindness, mutual respect are totally underrated. No one deserves to be bullied/harassed for holding a (non-hateful) political view.
...after you've stated your case &amp; agreed to disagree w angry tweeter, that is. Always smart to rebut someone head on initially. But repeat?
Curious: at what point does it become harassment? Say you haven't responded to an angry tweet, yet tweets from user keep coming-10 in a row?
@Sara_s_fox @dmrider He killed someone. If you want to spend energy blaming Harper for that, your choice. Equating punish't w/bigotry? No.
My God, Caucasians attempting to school ME about bigotry and xenophobia. Please take a long vacation away and disappear in the woods.
@Sara_s_fox @dmrider Free speech, amen. I was "out" with the previous tweeter, not on this subject as a whole, thank you very much.
Someone with 35 followers is all up in my chain for expressing an opinion. GASP! I disagreed with someone! By God, how will we ever live?!
@Sara_s_fox @dmrider Ah, because having a different view is absolutely forbidden on social media. Gotcha. EVERYONE must agree w/ Edney today
Ouch! This is so painful but true, eh, USA? -&gt; Politics - The Idiot's Guide to Smart People 
@deviner92 We'll agree to disagree whether Canada's leader (&amp; its policies) are "bigoted". That's what my initial comment was about. I'm out
@deviner92 That doesn't explain our immigration policy. China, India, Philippines, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran+. These countries source of immgts
@deviner92 Do you live in Toronto? Ontario, for that matter? Are you aware how many immigrants Canada accepts per year? Come to Scarbs &amp; see
@deviner92 How so? Link? Also, as far as I know, Iranian and Turkish immigrants (not refugees) are being actively sought for Canada.
@g_meslin Part of a government plan to lure immigrants (and investors) from the region? Iranians do VERY well here.
How handsome are they? :)  Bonding extravaganza. #myfamilyties 
@g_meslin Yes, many Persians settle in North York. This is common knowledge.
@PunnedIt55 @MaryTylerMog @dmrider @pmharper What's this? A threat? Are you saying there's a policy forbidding ppl from practicing Islam?
@deviner92 Would love to. Any useful/factual links about immigration and refugee policy in Canada from credible sources? Thanks!
If xenophobes whine abt "uneducated" immigrants from "3rd world" countries "ruining" Canada shove this in their faces 
@dmrider @pmharper Irresponsible choice of words. Isn't Canada accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees? Aren't there many mosques here in Canada?
@Janet_Davis Why not install them in your ward, also? Would beautify the area!
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't understand the hoopla about freeing Omar Khadr (big story here in Canada) He confessed to killing someone.
@Agovinoveritas Interesting place... :)  Thanks!
@balkissoon @chantalbraganza Oh, how awful. I'll have another look at the story. Hopefully @OntMinLabour can do something to protect workers
@chantalbraganza @balkissoon I've seen many nail technicians wear nose/mouth masks. Do those help? Hope so!
@Agovinoveritas Haunting. Is this Ireland Park at Harbourfront?
@e_tolley You've read this concise criticism by parliamentary journalist Dale Smith, I assume? 
@siomo What the very hell.

@dmrider @TorontoRobFord @TorontoStar Oh, the cheese! Excellent cause, though. Good for Ford. :)

#TBT Oh, the joy! ;)  My father (left) at 10 yrs old w/my grandparents+uncles (+ family friend) in Corfu Greece, 1950 
@cnutsmith Oh my God, this girl needs to run far away from this man. Mental problems = understatement. And yes, Air Canada should be worried
@BruceKlorfine Bingo. :)
Case in point: My exchange with a well-known Canadian journalist who simply can't acknowledge he made a mistake: #pls

I can't BEAR hearing actors talk about themselves, their 'process', their projects. Please stop asking indulgent q's &amp; maybe they'll stop.
Problematic, prejudiced headline, no? &gt;Is Chinese wine any good?  
@robert_ruggiero So excellent you're putting the west 'burbs on TO's urbanist map. Need better rep in east &amp; north ends, beyond Bluffs etc.
@robert_ruggiero Aw, thanks for vote of confidence but I'm SO not an expert! Hoping someone (Man/Canto speaking) in area volunteers. Feelers
It would've been cool to have a #JanesWalk along Steeles Ave (Chinatown North), between Kennedy &amp; McCowan. Underrepresented. Interesting.
You are entitled to stay in your neighbourhood, by all means, but at the very least, please DON'T slam/insult other neighbourhoods. Let live
Suspect transplants who boast they 'never go north of Bloor' in TO, etc. are small-towners at heart &amp; reality of a big city terrifies them.
Is there anything more boring than chicken breast? Or lentils? (Heh heh...I can food shame too.)
Here's the Pacific Mall / Market Village complex (view from Steeles Ave.) Chinatown North. Fierce competition in 905. 
How adorable are my cousins in the Philippines?! Pinoy pride, all the way. (Offend my glorious fam, and you're done.) 
Look who greeted us upon our visit to Splendid China Mall (Steeles Ave.): #budai #laughingbuddha #GTA #Toronto :D 
@VanityFair Sure.
When I need to know what's hip &amp; happenin', I look to my 15-yr old niece, who was at YouTube fanfest woo-hooing for @laurDIY &amp; @BethanyMota.
@Sean_YYZ Perhaps project is stalled. Across the street from P Mall/Market Village is upscale Asian-themed mall anyway- Splendid China Mall.
@Sean_YYZ Thanks for the link! Info there a bit outdated. Wondering what latest status is - hope demo cancelled. King's Square in the works!
@spacing ^ Has anyone at Spacing investigated what became of plans to demolish Market Village (Markham)? 
So, Market Village (@ Pacific Mall complex) is slated for demolition? My goodness- why? Remington Centre plans! #nuts 
Wonder if anyone's ever been harmed/killed for a negative review? Particularly one that's untruthful, exaggerated, and meant to kill biz? :o
@bear_dee_arr Perhaps. I remember early 90's being extremely rough for job hunters. Lots of empty shops/closures.  Etn Centre - ghost ville.
I...I hate to be the one to say it, but doesn't anybody remember the devastating recession that followed NDP win in Ontario? I do. #abvotes

Underrated food courts in Scarbs. My random dinner: fried tofu +beef brisket+pork wonton noodle soup $5.50. Delicious 
Indeed, absolutely, yes!  :D #Scarborough #burbs #StripMallDelights. 
@MacleansMag What kind of photo is this to put on your feed? Can you use discernment, please? Young students follow you to be informed. Thx!
@DougSaunders Similar arguments heard in Ontario:  
@LouisaMcCormack Hola - City of Toronto to the rescue.:) Registration June 5th (double check date for your area) 
@JesseBrown @_kevindonovan The victims have done NOTHING wrong, &amp; everything right. They were brave &amp; right to come forward. Put away shame.
@TheSocialCTV @cynthialoyst @projectplay @mopete24 We didn't actually get to SEE the playground in this video.
@CTVToronto Pure exploitation of honest people wanting to come to Canada. So glad she's been caught!
@angryasianman At least they called her out on it, though...? I was expecting worse. Whew!
@angryasianman Have you seen BBC's "China's reaction to the Met Gala gowns"? 
Impressive! Congratulations to Scarborough's students. :) cc @johntory @krushowy #TOpoli #onpoli #onted  
I can understand the appeal of food trucks in areas where there's a lack of eatery selection. (Say...industrial swaths.) Otherwise...hype.
Hi @Kathleen_Wynne, I'm surprised you're "unsure" what Ontario teacher's strike is all about. It's your job to know &amp; to address responsibly
Hey! Mongolian Grill @ Market Village (once a fixture!) is now Yamamoto Japanese Cuisine. Love the carriage seats. :) 
Some shops are struggling here. The Internet cafe is closed. The Chinese dried seafood joint is done. Needs attention 
Media! :) 
Midnight specials! :) (Market Village.) Fish ball noodle soup. Korean beef noodle soup. Baked escargot. Oxtail soup.+ 
...and more specials as I wander outside. (City Hollywood Cafe). Chinese and "Western"-style breakfasts offered. Yum. 
Warning: the chef has wandered off... :o (Not super busy on weekday mornings...) :) 
Market Village food stalls (shabu shabu, Taiwanese style noodles, dim sum +). Adjacent to Pacific Mall. Still alive. 
Breakfast special (congee+cheung fun) $3.95 @ Market Village, Scarb/Markham border. Crazy amt of food avail, 9:30am! 
Tulips! Now we can confirm100% spring has arrived...no fooling around. :) #toronto #burbs #gardens 
@davidbfung Leaning toward false. A combo of Twitter + blog seems to work for people looking for more in-depth content. See tech/mommy blogs
@Trinitek No problem. :)
@Trinitek Keep in mind it's much smaller than Pacific. Otherwise, worth a look!
I know you're peaking at Twitter's reaction. Do it. ;) 
Speechless. 
Gentle reminder: Refrain from preaching about a city as an 'expert' unless you live there, esp. grew up there. Blind spots galore otherwise.
@Trinitek It's at Steeles &amp; Kennedy Road, right across from Pacific Mall! :) (A quieter, bit more upscale version of P Mall.)
"The solution to a lack of upward mobility is to move to a better neighbourhood." D'oh. Where to begin with that? Abandoning the poor helps?
Judging from several "studies" I've read about poverty/class lately, it seems that the least brightest minds are in social science. Scary.
I wouldn't mind living near the Bluffs (lovely view!), but SOME of the surrounding area is a little sketchy. Dodged 2 drugged up men.
@UpshotNYT My God, the most important insight comes in this article's last sentence!
If I grew my own herbs, I'd probably save a bit of money. Or...I could journey to south Scarbs &amp; steal from my father's garden. Mwahaha! ;)
Dropped by Splendid China Mall, #ScarbTO. Snazzier than it appears outside. Spas, salons, Chinese med, gaming+. Quiet

I knew many in Toronto, too --&gt; How Bay Area's Filipino DJ Scene Turned Teens into Turntable Stars 
@DesmondCole Yes. Precarious employment must be addressed by Liberal gov't, esp in Ontario. Shameful lack of action-&gt; 
You're not interested in delicious food, bubble tea &amp; awesome deals? Fine. But how dare you try to dictate where others can shop!!! #Canada
Caucasians complaining about "too many Asian malls"?! Do you know downtowns have CHINATOWNS? This is Chinatown for the burbs, you fools. SMH
Progressives when they agree with a protest: "A riot is the language of the unheard" etc. When they disagree: "Dinosaurs afraid of change".
@Kathleen_Wynne @MitzieHunter Angry parents (some with children) are protesting ON's "radical" sex ed curriculum. Now at your const' office.

Good morning! :) #ScarbTO 
And yes, as someone who grew up in areas filled with successful, even wealthy and fascinating, immigrants, it makes my blood boil everytime.
The fact that we hear more about immigrants "struggling" or "failing" disproportionate to the immigrants succeeding and WINNING is bigotry.
The older generations are hopeless, but we CAN teach our kids (upcoming gen) to stop hate + judgement based on race. We CAN teach openness.
It's safe to say that the "white flight" from places like Scarborough &amp; Markham (where nonwhite immigration prevails) is straight up bigotry

No Filipino food for the wifebeaters. <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>🏻

@Hulchanski @thenation You're aware the 6 officers involved have now been charged (5 now in custody)? 
Yes, a place called My Big Fat Greek Buffet exists in Mississauga. I did eat there today (opa)! Moussaka, spanakopita, souvlaki...lukewarm.
Crazy idea of the month, #1: Drive from Scarborough to Mississauga through Eglinton Ave only (!) 2-hour journey, kids 
Excellent!  New law allowing 911 calls from all hotels + biz w/out extra 9. -&gt; Kari's Law sails through Texas House. 
Yes, I'm concerned. Intervention needs to happen. Resources ready, for ALL young people, of any race. My observation, though, is what it is.
I'm going to put it out there. Some of the young white males in Scarbs (particularly the south end) do NOT look well. Seem drugged/agitated.
Are you aware that the Chinese + Japanese helped build the Canadian Pacific railroad in the 1800s, and thousands died doing so? #GetInformed

Just another day in the oh-so-evil/unsustainable/unhip suburbs. Pffft. Live &amp; let live. We are happy in our skin. #TO 
@malimuffinbaby_ Makes me appreciate my life and the good people in it even more.
@cnutsmith Yay - a T &amp; T shout out!  By far, my favourite supermarket. Fresh dim sum to go? Yes, please.
How hard is it for reasonably intelligent people to understand the difference between IMMIGRANTS and REFUGEES? Stop mischaracterizing ppl!
@StarOpinion Why is that crap being peddled? Do ppl understand how rigorous it is for today's immigrants to qualify?They are HIGHLY educated
@karenkho What a vile human being. All the curses on him. (What's his connection? He used to live there til 'all them immigrants took over'?
@StarGTANews Sounds good. Brilliant illustration, too.
@malimuffinbaby_ @RNMeetsWorld The worst! What an enormous loss. :(
Student group fights to ensure their interests aren’t lost in teacher unrest  
@RNMeetsWorld @malimuffinbaby_ Terrible news. Rest in peace! cc @andersoncooper 5 nursing students killed in crash: Georgia.
@Headshakin @DesmondCole How is the situation in Vancouver now, Sim?

Because we sure don't. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏻<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏽
@pupomark I'm not sure I see anything Sri Lankan about those cookies... come to north Scarborough for the real deal. ;)
I was wondering why my Sri Lankan neighbour giggled when I said I tried 'lampries' for lunch. It's pronounced LUMP RICE - which makes sense!
@TracyTongCP24 @Raptors @CP24 You are literally everywhere, Tracy! :D
Using the f-word (Lord how I hate profanity) toward me or in my mentions: blocked, 100%. No regrets. (Hasn't happened yet) Pre-emptive tweet
Calling someone a "troll" for having an opinion that differs from yours is arrogant, yes. Harassing, abusing, ridiculing - yes, trolling.
I love people. Good, decent, caring, trustworthy people. People who try to be better. But I gotta say, I can't stand arrogance &amp; rudeness.
@HeerJeet ...P.S. Yet you bemoan that Canadians are too polite and dislike conflict &amp; confrontation? Pffft. Take care.
@HeerJeet Riiight. So bringing up a point about your reading preferences (though you criticize lack of minority representation) is trolling.
Someone claiming it's "racist" for Indian artists to use bhangra music in vid abt Toronto (IVIVI) is staggeringly idiotic. Lost its meaning.
@CP24 How sad...
@cnutsmith Ni Ji is my next go-to for sushi in Scarbs: 
Pooja! --&gt; Notable: Young Professional Feature of the Month @poojahandatv: 
Vital intelligence gathering or meddling? Police across Canada under pressure to stop carding people 
@HeerJeet P.S. Judging from the work you most discuss and scrutinize, I doubt you could manage this. Just saying. ;) #newperspectives
@HeerJeet --&gt; "I read books by only minority authors for a year. It showed me just how white our reading world is." 
@DesmondCole 15,000 shares - wow! From the comments here, I don't think people realize The Beaverton is satire. My God.
@AshleyCsanady No problem. :)
@AshleyCsanady @cnutsmith I love Chako's in Scarborough. We always have a great AYCE meal there. Sushi too. Fun! 
...unless you are all masochists who LOVE waiting 2 hours in line! (And how very cruel of sweet Uncle Tetsu to allow this!)
Since most reviewers claim Uncle Tetsu cheesecakes 
Classic Rex Murphy tongue lashing: Hillary Clinton &amp; McGuinty share legacy of missing emails &amp; shamelessness 
Sigh. I'm being needlessly cranky. Sure they mean well. Point is - TRY to use actual communities' photographers/writers to tell the stories.
I think what annoys me about that kind of project is it's someone who tends to 'other' newcomers, who is seeking to patronize or 'victimize'
I - I'm not sure what a 'social photographer' is - one who 'documents' immigrants in Toronto. Try local news, Facebook, Instagram, blogs pls
Hello, Twitterati! Anybody on Yelp too? Add me! You know I love food - eating, photographing, writing about, etc!)

@FungBros Hey brothers. :)  Are you aware that the FYI channel is on 88 here in Canada? That's supremely lucky, isn't it...? :D
By progressive, I mean beneficial &amp; growth-oriented. Lifting up small biz, organizing youth/afterschool programs, beautifying, creating jobs
Does @norm actually do anything progressive for his ward? I've noticed Agincourt experiencing a bit of a decline. Biz needs more promo/help
@angryasianman @JaneLui Cool! :)  (Awesome moves with the nunchucks!)
@maelynxp Really?!
#TOpoli Greater Toronto area home prices by neighbourhood: a city in demand. Scarborough prices up! cc @jen_keesmaat 
Are there any influential Toronto-based urban writers who actually grew up here? The perspective from schools &amp; diff generations important.
P.S. Warning! The lampries at Hopper Hut are monumental. I'll admit this one conquered me. (Love the chick pea balls) 
Okay, this is wild. I opened the banana leaf...and discovered curry mutton/anchovies/rice/potatoes/egg/chilli peppers 
Sri Lankan take-out in #ScarbTO (Mutton lampries and suciam) at Hopper Hut! :) #TOeats 
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO I'd have to work up courage to do that. ;) Thank you for the offer, though...much appreciated. Yes, time for sleep!
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO True. She'll probably remember your attempts, though.
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Hmm...perhaps he or she isn't accustomed to a more open environment? Needs to break down some of that resistance. ;)
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Awesome. I'll bet it's the highlight of their week. Sounds like something I'd love, for sure.
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO I took a photography class once @ Ryerson (cont'd ed), but had to quit b/c the instructor droned on + didn't inspire
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Brilliant way to do it. Natural teacher! :)  (It's often hard to make learning enjoyable.)
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Pretty cool stuff! That class must've been quite an experience...
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Thank goodness you didn't. :)  Great work...so unique. Beautiful yet also interesting. Students lucky to have you!
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Sounds fun...I used to bumble around a little, with hilarious results. ;)  I will attempt it again and be confident.
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Saw the work on your website. You are mega talented!
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Ahhh!  Will be keeping track of the info. Sounds amazing - thanks Margaret! :D
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO A friend went to Cedar Ridge years ago &amp; created the most gorgeous watercolours, which are hanging at his work/home.
@TorontoStarLife Scarborough &amp; Markham have Xscaper Arts which have horror aspect: 
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO That would be excellent - definitely something to think about. Excited!  All depends on our schedule + cost, though
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Sounds glorious to me! (I'm actually thinking of taking a painting class in the fall. Dream to be able to paint!)
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Ooh, very nice, though! :D
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO That's when it's truly tough. Such a grind. Spring/summer, though...walking isn't too bad. :)
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO Man, if it were safer, I'd cycle far more often. Would solve alot of issues. Right now, it's too scary on main roads
@MargaretChown @Walk_TO I'm lucky - only 1 bus ride to 2 different community centres for me. (2 buses IF I'm too lazy to walk a bit - lol.)
@MorganBaskinTO I dunno...life expectancy is nearing the 80's (for women) now, so relatively speaking...
@StarGTANews Oh, dear God.
@votechen @tdsb @Sterlingps Awesome! :)
@filipinofood Ooh, any especial stories to share, nalang? I am berry curious. ;)
Oh, man. The father of one of my daughter's kindergarten classmates died. That's pretty rough. :( Writing up a sympathy card together.
It's a little sad that people need instructions on 'how to be happy'. Maybe I take for granted there is always a positive side to things...?

Oh. A Christian Academy teacher, 27, arrested for sex with student, 15: cops (East Baton Rouge, Louisiana)

7 Thoughts From a Chronically Unhappy Person 
Absolutely amazing rare beef and tripe pho at Lac Vien in Scarborough. :) #ScarbTO 
@rachelmendleson I hope protecting children was the #1 concern of this sh*t disturbing. At the end of the day, that's Sick Kids intentions.
@HapaMamaGrace @momdotme @OurMixedStories Agree with you. A rather silly premise! Being more empathetic + exposed to another culture - yes.
@TorontoStar @Park_People @thekeenanwire This does not look like an appealing skate park. I hope it's just the angle of photography, but...
@CBCNews @mattgallowaycbc @DesmondCole @metromorning @torontolife I remember @dwightdrummond had a highly publicized problem as well.
@piya @DesmondCole You only have to look at how many white people left Scarborough as huge waves of nonwhite immigration arrived here.
@StarGTANews Any word on the affected neighbours? Any organized help for them? @Toronto_Fire
@ivortossell You don't think media should ask him why he's such an unprofessional jerk?  Such belittling and immature public tweets. Ugh.
@DesmondCole @torontolife Heard your interview with Matt Galloway on CBC this morning. "Lowered expectations based on race is racist". Yes.
@BeverlyYanuaria Yes! :)  She is priceless.
@BeverlyYanuaria I'm enjoying the Chinese/Tawainese/American identity issues. The culture-specific humour is rare on network TV. #renewFOTB
@BeverlyYanuaria Eddie (FOTB character) has many friends. It's not meant to be a straight documentary of E Huang's life...just loosely based
@metromorning @DesmondCole THAT is how a radio interview is done. Nothing superfluous &amp; rambling...straight to the meat. Nice work - both.
@LisaBloom Paris?
@DavidHains A bit of a jerk. What in the world does John Tory see in him? Such a caricature of a politician.
@mpeers Just realized they sell motorcycles! Check here:

@JohnLorinc @DesmondCole Well done, Desmond. I have to admit, I've done the run-as-soon-as-I-exit-my-bus thing. Good luck with the mission.
Whining on and on about food trucks in a city with sooo many ridiculously good restos of all types &amp; price ranges is...super silly &amp; a bore.
I've done the calculations, my friends. I could eat at a different Scarborough establishment 3 times a day ALL year, and STILL miss many. :o
Although Asian food is well-represented all over Scarborough, it's safe to say Steeles Ave has a near lock on it. :)

@simonhoupt @shadkmusic @CBCRadioQ Hi Simon, is your article auto-correcting to "Q"? I thought the lowercase is the thing, now.
@cnutsmith True. :(  Will visit their new digs, tho. Hopefully you'll continue to highlight the best of Scarbs. SO great for biz here. :)

@JygaBite @DesmondCole Now that he's in a higher profile position, and with greater power, I'm optimistic. I believe the will is there, yes.
Other than @HumeChristopher, I've had enlightening &amp; respectful discussions w/ several of their top columnists, who take feedback seriously
I know I've criticized @TorontoStar's (lack of) good coverage of TO's multicultural communities, but generally does great quality reporting.

I stand corrected! After being raised in London, Ont. &amp; schooled in Kitchener, Shad went to Vancouver to start music career. Oops. Apologies
@ScenesFromACity Whoops - my mistake! *turns purple* Thanks for the link! :)
@goldsbie It might have been corrected - bravo! 
Sibbald Point (past Georgina, Ontario) along Markham Road is freaking beautiful. Will definitely be back this summer for stress free fun.
@ScenesFromACity Hmm. Never heard anything about Shad being in Vancouver. He was raised in London, went to school in Kitchener, moved to TO.
What's scary is we trust what journalists tell us. This can have negative consequences = when @goldsbie wrote Malvern (Sc) has an RT. My God
(Some) journalism is appallingly bad: BASIC FACT wrong: CBC’s new Q host Shad (from LONDON, ONT not Vancouver) begins

@Sweetingd @ScarbTO It's on Finch Ave East &amp; Middlefield - just a few blocks east of McCowan Rd.
When one looks at California immigrant suburbs' grandness of design (arches, gardens, beautiful patios, outdoor plazas) = Spanish influence.
A few too many ugly squat brown buildings in TO. We're so accustomed to plainness, when new buildings have curves/bright colours = big event

@ThreeStarPet @ScarbTO P.S. Sorry about that oversight! :)
@ThreeStarPet @ScarbTO Yes, it's the banquet restaurant attached to Samosa King (pic). I've only tried take-out end. 
@ThreeStarPet @ScarbTO Yes, plenty of vegetarian options! :)
@ThreeStarPet @ScarbTO It's awesome! 5 samosas for $1. :) (Keep in mind it's take-out.) Excellent selection of Indian food. :)
Thanks, USA Today --&gt; Annual Events in Toronto Worth Your Time 
Walked over to Embassy/Samosa King in #ScarbTO for some Indian sweets (almond burfi) and bags full of fresh samosas. 
Good thing Indians in Toronto have their own media, or the city wouldn't have a clue Tuesday was a major festival #TO 
Indeed it is!  Considering taking some painting classes myself... :) #art 
I've noticed journalists who are in the business of demoralizing ppl, &amp; creating 'scorched earth' narratives. They don't deserve a platform.
@sarahboesveld As he should be. He's a pedophile, yet wants access to children? What kind of insane world is this? Sentence to max prison.
@siomo Btw, has she considered the impact closing schools will have on communities? That young families won't move in &amp; nhoods be abandoned?
I know it's tricky to learn new terms, but...Swaminarayan Mandir (hindu temple), Jin Ying (buddhist), Islamic foundation, Pacific Mall...#TO
Sigh. Such limited, confining definitions of who and what Toronto is as a growing city. Open up, kids. Represent us, border to border.
Judging from most urbanists' videos and photos, Toronto's only cultural landmarks are CN Tower, City Hall, streetcars. Temples? Mosques? Nah
So, the Indian government labels certain groups of citizens 'Other Backward Class'. Huh. So, caste system still alive and well? *sigh*

I don't know what TTC critics are complaining about. Buses on most routes in Toronto come every 5 mins during peak hours. cc @thekeenanwire
My lens can't even fit the entire length of an accordion bus! #bendybus #articulatedbus #TTC #TorontoRushHour :) 
@TheAgenda @tvo @spaikin Will you also be covering the sentencing of former dep. Minister of Education (!) Ben Levin, guilty of child porn?
@kady It's a depressing, maddening story...and the public should be informed about it.
True art either beautifies our environment, elevates or expresses our spirit, or enlightens us about ills in an appealing way - or does all.
@StarGTANews @tara_deschamps For such serious accusations+confessions, he (former minister of EDUCATION, for god's sake!) should serve 10.
@kady Here it is: 
@kady Who at CBC News is, please? This is serious case=former deputy Minister of Education! Child porn &amp; incitement to abuse not newsworthy?
Former Ontario minister repeatedly claimed to have had sex w/ his own daughters in online chats, court hears 
P.S. There is an excellent small art gallery at the top of the Bluffs!: 
@life_of_Y Yes, multi-millionaires pulling this kind of (publicity) silliness is irritating. She should donate to worthy programs &amp; sit down
Grateful that old-school imperial Chinese dim sum restaurants are still kicking around in Scarborough &amp; Markham! #yum 
Lotus leaf sticky rice... #dimsum :) 
@TorontoStar Hope the offender is caught. Rest in peace.
Yes, Lainey Lui (gossip guru) is a bit shallow. But this piece made me laugh+nod vigorously &gt; Food-Shaming 
@AshleyCsanady Definitely no excuse for this behaviour. If they need help, police then mental services have to step in. Just...*shudders*.
@AshleyCsanady This is horrific. I hope they've caught the racist idiots. I'm stunned this happens in Toronto in 2015. #crimeTO #TOpoli
I'm a bit worried about the girl (possessed?) but Fung Bros always capture Asian Cali burb life well: (MUSIC VIDEO) 
@balkissoon @Scott_Gilmore @BBCWorld Ok. I don't think that issue is the focus of the story, though. Spurring interest in #MMIW is.
@VuongKevin @JohnTory Thanks for the info, Kevin! :)
@angryasianman What a sad excuse for a human.
@StarGTANews Horrible. RIP.
@nytimes The man wearing the Che Guevara t-shirt is 100% a tourist. Those are sold at every souvenir shop &amp; the airports.
@balkissoon @Scott_Gilmore @BBCWorld How do you suggest BBC - bringing this crisis to a wider audience - make stories abt #MMIW 'original'?
Shared spaces, solar panels, high ceilings &amp; plenty of light: contrary to urbanists' contempt, STC is a great hub #TO 
Shirley Temple fan. :). (It's an occasional treat, you fun police!) #Scarborough 
Suggested bus stop poses from Forever 21. ;)  The random "back-kick" move is particularly jaunty &amp; delightful. #life 
Most importantly (and obviously), the political situation in Hong Kong became less dire, less desperate when the "takeover" didn't happen.
But. Many Hong Kong immigrants became engineers, doctors, pharmacists, entrepreneurs, developers, etc and enjoyed success. So...homesick?
Seeing urbanists on my newsfeed talk about renting cars just to come to Scarborough! SOO odd. Many bus routes, as thousands take everyday.
@VuongKevin @JohnTory Fantastic. :) Do you know if there is anything like this for youth in north Scarborough?
@JALRoom11 @tdsb Yes - very talented students! These were displayed at Woodside Square for the community to enjoy. :)
@StarGTANews So, everyone is suited for university and abstract learning? No. Ppl have talents in various areas that will benefit society.
@MacleansMag @GGDavidJohnston Yes, so comfortable for people to work evening shifts, take several buses home+pay bills. Help fam circle 1st.
Ahh, the Fung Bros keep me smiling. Such life givers. :D
Interesting self-portraits + animal symbols by students @ Albert Campbell Collegiate in Scarborough: #localart @tdsb 
Holy heaven almighty - #JodiArias is a true psychopath. Defends slicing her ex-boyfriend's throat &amp; shooting him in the head. Wants leniency
Ecstatic it's spring. :D 
Feeling sad also because I used to teach HK kids ESL. So many talented &amp; smart ppl. Many felt they couldn't 'get ahead' here in Canada. Ugh.
On a selfish note, many of my favourite Hong Kong businesses (food stalls, kids' clothes+toys, bubble tea places, etc) have closed. Sad. :(
I've heard Hong Kong-born AND Canadian-born are deciding to leave Canada for better career opportunities- make more money in HK. Story there
Remember the "brain drain" of Hong Kong as tens of thousands immigrated to Canada? Feels like the reverse is happening now, as many go back.

@colbycosh @jjerms12 Good night. :)
@jjerms12 @colbycosh Am a believer in multiple intelligence. I lack visual/spatial but am ok w verbal/linguistic. Does that mean one "dumb"?
@colbycosh @jjerms12 Just my experience as a trained teacher speaking. Is that allowed? FYI - I've never seen Canada's Smartest Person.
@colbycosh Eh, save the mansplaining. Gardiner Theory of Intelligence rocks the house. Was a teacher for nearly a decade, so...we disagree.
@colbycosh No it isn't. It's genius and explains different yet necessary aptitudes. You'd be a nightmare as a teacher.
@PeterKimGlobal Alleluia, Pope Francis! Please let my bank know. *wink*
Too many first-born killings in the Old Testament. Horrifying.

@jm_mcgrath Ooh, thanks! I'll check it out soon. :)
@jm_mcgrath Where'd you go? Always looking for good Korean BBQ. My usual is Chako's. :)
@mattgallowaycbc Have you reported that elected Scarborough trustee David Smith refused to file expenses &amp; was removed? Quality candidates.
@torontoist Interesting - there's only 1 rental property in northeast Scarb here, yet we're singled out for 'poverty' because...largely POC?
Out of curiosity, browsing through realtor.ca, checking out modest Scarborough houses. Jaw-dropping prices - detached 3bdrm: half a million!
@CannabisDad @dtopping What's that? The elected Scarborough trustee, David Smith, who refused to file his expenses, has been kicked out.
#Dateline cases are phenomenally twisted. Tonight, father-daughter murderer duo. Love that justice is (almost) always served, though.
"Info Wars" is a new concept to me...but now I see how it's instigated. Downplaying certain events, changing details, manipulating narrative
@StarGTANews Akin to bullying! Criticism is welcome, but not public flogging. Shame on this behaviour. What example does this set for kids?
@frc_kevin @YouGottaEatHere @hogtownsmoke Wow. BBQ looks great! I LOVE 'YOU GOTTA EAT HERE'! Keep highlighting places of pleasure in Canada!

@dtopping Sorry, I'm still upset at Toronto Life's negative portrayal of Dir Education Donna Quan. Not constructive to society. Carry on. :)
@dtopping Lemme guess...plenty of private schools advertise w/ you. (No wonder you - TL coverage - is unreasonably harsh on the TDSB. Shame.
Undeniably demonstrates Filipinos are family-oriented, generous people. Speaking from experience (mother's side), love to share w/family reg
The fact that (most) Filipino eateries focus on large-party catering &amp; trays-to-go, rather than individual servings speaks highly of them.:)

@davidbfung Best show. About time Asians occupied US prime time successfully! Many levels of awesomeness. Hope it's renewed. :D

@JohnLorinc @thewardTO @coachhousebooks P.S. Key is to ensure every new TO immigrant in coming generations succeeds just as well. #TOpoli
@ScenesFromACity MUCH NEEDED!
@JohnLorinc @thewardTO @coachhousebooks Every immigrant I know (Filipinos/ Guyanese/Grk/Chinese etc) started in apt, bought house w/in 5 yrs
@JohnLorinc @thewardTO @coachhousebooks Will pick it up! Interesting aside: most immigrants in TO don't stay in low conditions - move on up.
@PeterKimGlobal I believe it. My cousin stopped paying her insane $500+/month insurance and started taking the subway/carpooling instead.

Always exciting to discover 'hidden' food courts inside unassuming small strip plazas in Scarborough. Quiet one: #TO 
While Ontario has ex-dep Minister Education (Liberal) charged w child porn (truly horrifying), media is hyped on Duffy family visits+lunches
I know many Caucasians are perfectly decent, smart, open-minded people, but I was scarred by some ignorant and cruel ones. So...takes time.
#IOnceDatedSomeoneWho made me feel ashamed of my mixed-Filipina heritage. NEVER tolerate someone insulting your food, culture, expressions +
Food that doesn't excite me: pesto, french toast, fries, fish+chips, apple pie, chicken nuggets. Lack of complex flavour+spices = fail IMHO.
Strengthening of Asian-Am subcultures (pride in auth food, lang, trad values +) is a "Screw You" to being mocked in the past #HumanNature :)
So what, we drink tea? 626, young, wild + free! Immigrant suburb pride! 626 -&gt;Music Video by Fung Bros: 
So, basically a dehumanizing narrative becomes acceptable, which opens the door for xenophobes to show their ugly faces and smear good ppl.
If predominantly people of colour live in an area (whether they're east/south South Asian, Caribbean, Hispanic+) guaranteed neg description.
Ever since reading inaccurate characterizations of my nhood (neg exaggerations for effect), I mistrust reporters' descriptions of comm'ties.
In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a little in love with the Fung Bros. :)
Dropped by Remely's for Filipino food take-out with the girls. (Lazy!) Calamansi + mango juices, and phone games too.

@thekeenanwire Isn't it important to document the problems? First, to show the urgency, and second to focus on type of fixes needed. #TOpoli
@thekeenanwire Ok, thanks. :) At least parents have that option - and so nearby.
@thekeenanwire I see. Are residents of that building banned from using the school playground? Usually they're open for public use off hours.
@SlateMoneybox @Slate Maybe they can start making more attractive clothing? Then sales may increase.
@thekeenanwire Also, your piece claims the playground is 'gone', but accompanying photos clearly show it there, adjacent to bricks. Confused
@thekeenanwire Hope the building problems you've described have been documented with photographs.

@amirightfolks Oh Jayzus. This is a freaking inhumane policy- forcing ppl to leave after yrs working in Canada. Contacting NDP to make noise
@amirightfolks Anything about the thousands of foreign workers being deported from Canada? 
@dmrider Hope he'll use his voice to stop mass deportation of Cda's temp foreign workers, good ppl willing to do tough jobs - now punished!
Some things worth getting angry abt, others not so much: John Moore: Pull plug on perpetual outrage 
This is wrong, @pmharper: Temp foreign workers forced to leave Canada 
While searching for the Canada Goose factory in #ScarbTO, I discovered Estee Lauder (cosmetics) has a plant here too! 
@jenniferhollett Unbelievable. This policy is inhumane. Fighting it is 100% NDP domain. Pls push your caucus to act with urgency to oppose!
@jenniferhollett Thank you. Regarding foreign workers in your ward, in Toronto? Rallies, protests planned? This is straight up wrong! Cruel.
@jenniferhollett Jennifer, what is the NDP doing to stop mass deportation of foreign workers? Ppl doing necessary work suddenly must leave?
@angryasianman Pls ask followers to tweet @pmharper to stop this: Foreign Workers Exiled Under New Immigration Rule - 
@DesmondCole Thx for your reporting on this. I am disgusted, angry, heartbroken by this.Deport hardest working ppl- inhumane! @thomasmuclair
Mass deportation of hardworking people (mainly from Asia, let's face it) seals the deal. NEVER vote for PC's. @RathikaS, what is NDP doing?
@pmharper Forcing hardworking foreign workers to leave Canada is inhumane and not beneficial for our country. Abrupt &amp; cruel. Reconsider pls

But what do I know? Apparently this approach has made Jeepney a hit in NYC among non-Filipinos trying Pinoy food for the first time.
It's sad that restaurants like Jeepney feel they have to alter their authentic Filipino dishes to make them more 'palatable' to Caucasians.

@SalmaZahid15 @tc_shaun What kind of change? Will you stop closing of our public schools? Laying off of teaching staff? Will you beautify?
Unless you own a small business or have ten children, I don't understand the appeal of Costco. The daily samples? The concrete snack bar? :/

@shawnmicallef With so much city-building happening in TO, maybe a feature / investigation on worker deaths? 
@shawnmicallef 
@CTVToronto Rest in peace. How awful. Respect for people building our city.
@shawnmicallef Speaking of class, did you hear 2 bricklayers building a condo downtown (High Park) died today? Any mention here or Spacing?
Instead of writing abt artisanal ghee+stairways to nowhere, why don't urban reporters investigate safety for ppl LITERALLY BUILDING OUR CITY
Class distinctions in action: two bricklayers building a condo in TO (High Park) die - not a peep from prominent TO writers. @thekeenanwire
Holy Jesus. RIP. --&gt; Two bricklayers killed in 7-storey fall at Bloor-Keele condo project 
@jenniferhollett Sometimes it's an opportunity = educate the ignorant. I've engaged w ppl w/ hurtful views &amp; managed a BIT of illumination.
Chicken or egg? Fact is Toronto is (relatively) safe because our police are good at what they do. Community policing, crime prev education +
@amandakhurley The fact that a professional would 'laugh' at a community is sad and a little infuriating. 'Burb centres are hubs. Full stop.

@Hulchanski The labelling on this map is misleading. Etobicoke is entire left side, Scarborough is entire right side - BOTH have increases.

@CBC @cbcdragon @manjitminhas @MicheleRomanow EXCELLENT CHOICES! :D
@HelenStratigos1 If they were to look around after a craft beer pub foray, they'd notice most of our med pros, engineers, developers are POC
@HelenStratigos1 Is it because it speaks to their belief &amp; narrative that POC's are 'behind", not as brilliant, not enterprising? Shuddup.
Patronizing media clapping like seals &amp; patting heads when POC @ TO achieves minor thing but ignores major accomplished POC like T Fung? Odd
I seriously wonder if any of these 'hashtag conversations' lead to any positive changes, any outcomes? Often repetitive echo chambers. Hope!

@VuongKevin @SamaraCDA Oh, that is too cynical! At the very least, young people must be encouraged to learn about candidates &amp; vote! (Link?)
Hi @AndrayDomise. Have you seen this? Humber Arboretum &amp; Rexdale Community HC received park grants: 
@DakGlobe P.S. Despite attracting half-a-million viewers daily across Canada (Cantonese-speaking), it seems no 'mainstream' media covered it
Hi @DakGlobe! Have you or the Globe ever done a story about Fairchild TV's success? Based in Richmond Hill, national. 
@VuongKevin @OECD That might reflect satisfied complacency. No real 'urgency' to change anything...?
No, @Deadline, reflecting America's rich diversity isn't 'too much'. It's long overdue: 
Hello @jlhurley! Has the Star ever done a story about Fairchild TV's success? 
Fairchild TV's interview w potential Progressive C leader Christine Elliot (ON) was most informative compared to other media #onpoli #topoli
Man, I wish Fairchild TV included English subtitles. Getting into Storm in a Cocoon drama. Trying to discern meaning thru expressions, etc.
Am I a terrible Canadian for saying I've never liked any of Tim Hortons' food offerings? French Onion soup, various sandwiches, etc. Bland.
@morganfieri @ScarbTO Yes!  If you're budget conscious, Tuesday is cheapie day -  dinner buffet is $9.99.
@morganfieri @ScarbTO We like it. :)  Decent selection of Cantonese dishes + sushi. (Lo mein, lemon chicken, satay beef, seafood, veggies +)
I hate to say this, but many Yelp reviews (esp for restaurants in less-than- affluent areas) sound like 'pearls before swine'. Ignorant. :/
Happy Panda's transformed into Dragon Handroll Buffet! My 5-year old loves new decor too, but misses pandas. #ScarbTO

Taste of China/Hong Kong/Taiwan/Japan/Thailand. Browsing @ Market Village is FUN! (Pacific Mall complex). Hi Toronto. 
Hooked on a Chinese soap opera called Storm in a Cocoon, set on silk farm (airs on Canto/Mandarin channel in TO) Romantic rivalry + poison?
My 5-yr old learns Mandarin and Tagalog (Filipino) @ school daily (TCDSB). Deemed a 'heritage language' school. LOVE IT. Ni hao ma? Kumusta?
You know what would make an interesting behind-the-scenes story? How cooks @ Mandarin Buffet make 100+ dishes &amp; desserts 2X/day, 7 days/wk!
@ScenesFromACity Not sure! Haven't followed story since. (At least the snazzy new development kept the mall's original fountain, near Glow.)
@ScenesFromACity P.S. Seniors who loved congregating at the original Don Mills Shopping Ctre have 'boycotted' this! Also: summer has turf.
@ScenesFromACity Canada's first outdoor mall. (Livelier in summer, though!) Glimpse of Glow's patio: (feat a friend):

@AGero @DesmondCole @IdilBurale Great to see many different faces, representing a good spectrum of TO. Inspiring to upcoming POC journos! :)
@DesmondCole @IdilBurale @AGero Quick note! Omar Sachedina was promoted to national news, and Gurdeep Ahluwalia is now at TSN. #TOpoli
@DesmondCole @IdilBurale @AGero Tracy Tong (CP24) needs to be included as well. (okay, done tweet-bombing!)
@DesmondCole @IdilBurale @AGero Curious why weather specialist Patricia Jaggernauth isn't included in the CP24 bios? Nearly everyday on air!
@DesmondCole @IdilBurale @AGero PS. The higher the ratings for diverse newscasts,  more we get. I watch + retweet journalists I want more of
@DesmondCole @IdilBurale @AGero CBC evening news (Dwight Drummond &amp; A Mediwake) = decent diversity as well. (CP24 = Pooja/Reena/JLee/Nneka+)
@IdilBurale @DesmondCole @AGero CP24 looks diverse - majority of on-air presenters are non white. Feels like the TO i'm most familiar with.
@EastSidersTV @ConstanceWu Happy birthday! Ni Hao Ma? ;) (Daughter's learning Mandarin at school. *wink*) Love u on Fresh Off the Boat! :
@JesseBrown @MrIanMacIntyre Love Food Network Canada. You Gotta Eat Here = more educational than anything Brown's done. He mostly complains.

@PlatanoSantana @snolanmuir @Salon Instead of driving employer out of biz, put pressure on company &amp; gov't= regulate+stop exploitation/abuse
@Slate They planned &amp; executed a brutal stabbing on a 12-year old girl. Violent and cruel. Ran away to avoid capture bc aware of right/wrong
Maroon 5 hullabaloo! Yes! Despite 5-min, drama-filled power outage (City of TO glitch!) awesome show @ ACC, Toronto: 
@torontoist What exactly is housed in there? I just see open space and colourful chairs. $112 million?!
@Salon Oh, brilliant advice. Throw millions in the developing world instantly out of work. Think through your boycott approach. Alternative?
@DougSaunders Surrounded by new immigrants from Sri Lanka (were lawyers there), China (all walks, ambitious), Iran (multi biz), Phil (med+)
@DougSaunders Living in Scarborough for 43 years. Mother came here from Philippines to work butt off as nurse, Dad from Greece as accountant
@DougSaunders A typical Downsview resident lives in public housing? No! Not representative. I still don't understand the hype. So odd.
@DougSaunders He landed his construction job through his school's co-op program, like many other TO kids who don't opt for college/uni. So?
@RHKINGarts Whoops - misread you! :)  Yes, Tory is constantly listening &amp; accepting ideas to improve all areas of TO. Wish he'd do the LRT!
Ahhh...a little alone time is bliss. :) #SingingInTheCar #LoudlyAndAwfullyAsIWant #MentalHealthBreak 
Is it just me, or does anyone else feel (mainly Caucasian) media HYPING hole-digger from * yawn * 'rough' street maddeningly condescending?

@DougSaunders Hyperbolic. Like saying Rob Ford is the epitome of Anglo behaviour in TO. Sells immigrant successes short. Condescending, IMHO

@yeahfilms @CNDLND @JesseBrown They've accomplished much (indisputable) and have inspired many young ppl to get involved, locally as well.
@jen_keesmaat Have you had a chance to enjoy March Break with your family (Zoo, ROM Science Center, parks, Disney World, etc)? Hope so! :)
@RHKINGarts Yay! People are much more comfortable, with room to breathe. :)
@Mr_MW_Smith I meant, greater variety. You must admit that mass immigration to Toronto has made it even more vibrant, and yes, interesting!
@multiasianfams @OurMixedStories @lukobe @mixed_race @getgln I think questions like that can be an opportunity to educate people. Expanding!
@CNDLND @JesseBrown Kielbergers are good eggs. CBC is smart to re-evaluate their approach before airing something potentially damaging.
Remember well-intentioned downtown lawyer who walked perimeter of TO burbs IN THE MIDDLE OF SUBZERO WINTER &amp; lamented 'no one' outside? SMH!
Noticed since John Tory became Mayor: more articulated (accordion, bendy, double) buses on Scarborough's arterials, more frequently. #TOpoli
@ScarbArchives I'm happy to hear that! :). New "pioneers" establishing communities, blending cultural traditions, adding to Cdn landscape .

@JoshMatlow So, technically, it WAS illegal, but no criminal charges or fines pursued. Got it!
@JoshMatlow I'm confused. If it wasn't illegal, &amp; simply for ''personal reasons', why was it filled, and he's no longer allowed to continue?
@MacleansMag Uh...the 3rd comment (written by "John Giles") under the article is troubling...
@Uubrix_Lila Is there a power outage?!
@katiecoolady Happy to hear that. &lt;3
@katiecoolady May the jurors read this and be at peace. Your writing is so insightful, thought-provoking...and heart-breaking. Bless you.
Ahaha! My 5 yr o (home w/cold) began meowing + hissing. When I said cats don't wear glasses + sweaters, she said, the 'fashionable ones do!'
@norm Wonder if he's been back recently? He may be shocked by how dramatically Scarb's changed!
Is it snobbish to say I prefer smart people? God, I hope not. Listen, everyone can improve their knowledge/experience. Ignorance = maddening

@TIFF_NET @Drake Impressively cut, but ultimately irritating. Sorry. Cool concept, though!
@CNDLND @AndrayDomise Scars run deep. Eloquently stated. Diverse voices needed, but all people should be allowed to speak as they see things
@jm_mcgrath Solutions, solutions. Focus!
My 75-yr old mother just rolled back to TO from Punta Cana.  24-hour dancing/dining/swimming+wants to return. Asians really do live forever!
@tdsb That is comforting to hear.
@jennyyangtv @aliwong3000 SO much fun! :D  (My only sad is about the young boy Phillip being ultimately rejected.Ouch! And he's adopted!) :(
@m_layton That's why it should be a multi-use complex (recreation, retail, food, etc) - not just gambling.

@m_layton When I go to Niagara Falls (home of FallsView Casino and others), I never gamble. It's a choice, interest, and option for adults.

@pedalpapa @jen_keesmaat They're walkable if you're fit! Yes, a little more effort (bus ride) at times, but burbs NOT a desert of amenities.
@pedalpapa @jen_keesmaat She was referring to suburban tower blocks. I'll have to videotape to counter apocalyptic myths urbanists selling.
It's true. San Jose is filled with intelligent men. Just sayin'. I'm attached and a tried-and-true Canadian, but if I weren't... *wink* #tip
@jen_keesmaat Please identify an apartment block in TO burb that's not within 5 mins of a strip plaza w/variety of shops/services + bus stop
@jen_keesmaat I agree that density must be done 'right', but to say 'burb apt blocks don't have nearby shops, churches, etc. is NOT true.

@JohnFurrToronto Right. It's the wealthy &amp; middle-class that demand the subways. You don't know a thing about me or my background. Stop, pls
@JohnFurrToronto Works for us. Meanwhile, please worry about your own ward. I'm off.
@JohnFurrToronto I'm happy with my councillor.
@JohnFurrToronto Perhaps shameful actions would decrease if they were listening more carefully? (Just one observation from a TO resident.)
@JohnFurrToronto Arguable. I'm neither of those characterizations. In any case, it's not an excuse to seem slack. I'm entitled to my opinion
@JohnFurrToronto Optics of all councillors in seats, looking at budget info/speakers would go a long way in showing ppl they're on the ball.
@JohnFurrToronto They're in the middle of the 2015 Budget debate, for goodness sake. This is important, and all should be paying attention.
Are city councillors aware they're on television, and the public can see when they are giggling/texting on their smartphones? Awful. #TOpoli
.@JohnTory Tory speaking about being 'careful stewards' of citizens' dollars. Sounds adamant: clear mandate to limit tax increases. #TOpoli

@mattgallowaycbc @JesseBrown @jonkay My God, what meager substance in that convo. No names of interesting new ppl + networks pursued. Shame.
It's my Twitter and I'll opine if I want to...
Strong intuition @JustinTrudeau doesn't have the brilliance or tough core principles to lead Canada. He's simply pandering to Harper bashers
That is a significant oversight. Many died while blasting their way through the tough mountain terrain, and hardly a peep about them. Shame.
Sad+frankly unacceptable that our Canadian history classes never mentioned the thousands of Chinese + Japanese who helped build CP railway.
@SeamusORegan Why does @NPR's headline not reflect facts in article? India &amp; Southeast Asia are both discussed. Also, Chinese new awareness
I've never been a serious sitcom enthusiast (whatever I'd catch, I'd catch - except for Family Ties!), but #FreshOffTheBoat is hilarious. :)
The upside = earned wisdom of what a healthy relationship looks &amp; feels like, and what genuine love involves. So many imposters to navigate.
When I look back at some of the characters (sorry!) I gave my time+thoughts to, I have great sympathy for younger me, and a bit of anger.
Every so often, a thought of terror hits me that the generation behind us (responsible for us when we're old) is full of sociopaths. Horror.

@aidans25mum @CouncillorMB Ward 41's councillor is Chin Lee. He's doing a fantastic job! :)
@CouncillorMB I've clearly hit a nerve with this issue! I'm not political - just a Scarb resident making an observation. 2 kids + my n'hood.
@CouncillorMB @aidans25mum @JohnFurrToronto Doesn't sound fair! Must fight to rectify that. Your residents+biz owners need good environment.
@CouncillorMB I'm fortunate, then!  Hope #Ward35 has similar successes soon! Need to attract new development + get ppl excited abt the area!
@CouncillorMB Thank you, Michelle! I will have a look. Always interested in #Ward35 as a gateway to Scarborough. Important=prosperity+beauty
@CouncillorMB I commend you (and the artists) on the mural! Now, for much-needed sprucing up &amp; beautifying of #Ward35 in general to match?:)
@JohnFurrToronto @CouncillorMB I don't buy it.Must be something gov can do to improve biz plazas.That said,reason why newer areas look great
@JohnFurrToronto @CouncillorMB She must be able to do SOMETHING to beautify area. Other areas of Scarb don't look so ugly. My ward is good!
@JohnFurrToronto @CouncillorMB She can work w/ developers+owners to beautify them- fix cracked pavement, signage,etc. Look around in Ward 41
#TOpoli @CouncillorMB's ward looks shabby. What has she accomplished? Rusted fences, rough-looking strip malls, etc. Gives Scarb a bad name.

@nparnessCTV I can't blame them. W/ much excess space in TO burbs, why must the board do this? Normally I support TCDSB, but I disagree here
@Uubrix_Lila Cappuccino!  
@Markus_Moos @ppreville @envwaterloo Perplexed. Philip Preville says he loves to hear questions/comments/challenges, yet he NEVER responds.
So, no real education going on about our city. Just the status-quo drum. Downtown/core nhoods=great+lively  Suburbs=bad/predictable. *Yawn*
In other words, we're saturated once again in familiar CN Tower posts, 'cool' graffiti, hipster (largely white) nhoods, while others ignored
A little amused that CBC's neighbourhood photo contest avoids any posts w culture/ethnicity at core - things that often define 'burb hoods.
@Markus_Moos @ppreville @envwaterloo Scarborough (TO burb) has PLENTY of spaces in rec programs;many free. Preville doesn't move there bc..?

@ScenesFromACity A little hobby of mine. Scarborough is the best playground to observe. :) #humannature #crosscultures
Race/culture is natural starting point, reference to possible commonalities: "Ooh, you have lumpia for lunch? Yum!"  "My Mom says that too!"
Lest you think I'm race/culture-obsessed, the most caring+rewarding friendships have been w/girls whose personalities I most loved #allraces
@ScenesFromACity Same here. I think race-congregating is more intense when there's a first-language bond, when people feel more comfortable.
Oddball mixed kids tend to flit btw cultural groups - though for me, it was largely Filipinos. But identity-wide + had friends of all races.
@ScenesFromACity It seems to me a natural social + cultural survival instinct, carving out one's identity in such a multicultural society.
@ScenesFromACity Interesting to observe-sharing language/pop culture/food/in-jokes/family friends/etc. My school (NotreDame) mixed more, btw
Scanning local mall food court @ lunch, teens (generally) group together by race. Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, Flips - self-segregating.
Every teenager in the Scarborough area is wearing a black Canada Goose parka with faux fur-trimmed hood (it seems). I miss bright colours.
@robert_ruggiero Exactly. People / organizations who keep tweeting at followers, and ignore all comments definitely lose esteem, IMHO. Rude!
Tweeters who never respond to respectful tweets, questions, or gentle opinion tweets fail at Twitter. Interaction is essence. Sorry - fail!

@CBCAlerts Hello CBC - #JodiArias hasn't been sentenced yet! On April 13th, Judge Stephens will decide life sentence or 25 years. No Death.
Why can't Judge Stephens sentence #JodiArias today?! It's been 7 years since the murder! Prolonging the family's pain + suffering is cruel!
A second jury has failed to come up with a verdict! Hung jury again! In 30 days, Judge Stephens will decide life or 25 years. Family cries.
I'm shaking a little! Heads up, #JodiArias trial watchers! A verdict, AT LAST: life or death sentence? HLN, Ch 41, covers it live @ 11:30 am

Surprisingly, no stage-fright! Rachel joins the Frozen crew (Elsa+Anna+Kristoff) for song about Sven... #ScarbTO #TBT 
This is quite cool! -&gt; Reel Toronto: Orphan Black's not-so-discreet filming locations 
@mattbosco1988 Stunning piece of work! I can imagine the patience and creativity involved. Great capture of TO's current status &amp; mood!

My 5-year old adores Odd Squad on @tvokids. FBI-esque kids solving math problems? Quick-talking hysterical fun? Yes! 
More @WhittamoresFarm adventures in amazing rural outback! *wink* It's Scarb/Markham, near #TorontoZoo. Pick berries!

Things I Never Learn From Our Mainstream Media: Toronto has a Shaolin Temple institute, and its kids performed here: 
Do city councillors have anything more important to do than make jokes about R Ford digging the tunnel? Subway to burbs is not a punchline.
Speaking Cantonese + Mandarin, MP @RathikaS fosters goodwill + admiration: 
Soon we'll emerge from hibernation &amp; visit @WhittamoresFarm! (Border of Scarborough + Markham.) Taste of last year: 
My 75-year old mother is packing for 2 weeks in Punta Cana, folks. That's how Pilipina retired nurses ("I worked so haaaaard!") roll. #Pinoy
