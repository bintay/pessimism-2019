@ericansmith_ I don't have that kinda money for a lawyer lol
@ericansmith_ your guess is as good as mine. They aren't even aware it happened and they said it doesn't show they double charged me
And I really wanted that sub!
@ericansmith_ because they took out an extra $150
@ericansmith_ on their end until it comes out. So at the moment they're saying that I wasn't double charged but my account is negative
@ericansmith_ they took out money already and now they have money that they're planning to take out tomorrow &amp; sprint won't see it
@ericansmith_ so now I have NO money
@ericansmith_ I'm so pissed off right now. I go to buy a sub &amp; my card declines, go to the bank to find out I've been double charged
How the hell do you manage to double charge a bill? I don't understand. Now I have a negative balance of over $100 &amp; no money. Thank you!
