Oh, and with female characters, perish the thought of a "strong, independent woman." Write a great character who just happens to be a woman.
veneer, hoping the audience won't notice that there is no substance. Audiences are BEGINNING to learn, but it's becoming ubiquitous.
That's what I'm noticing about "totally mature" storytelling in ALL mediums today, they cover up their failings, their FAILURES with a thin-
There are memorable characters who ARE badass, like Deadpool, Duke Nukem and Ellen Ripley, but all of them have something ON TOP of that.
Badass is not a substitute for personality, or depth. It can ADD to a character or story but it cannot BE the character or story.
@AnderWriter Perfect example: SHOVEL KNIGHT
@AnderWriter Fun comes first, before any triple A budgets, pretty graphics or anything else. If it's fun, i will play it with glee
@AnderWriter Aye. Although, I'm a guy who pre ordered and thoroughly enjoyed Duke Nukem Forever, so my tastes are decidedly old school
@AnderWriter That's the thing, so did Colonial Marines a few years ago
@AnderWriter I get the feeling Mad Max won't be good. I'm already detecting the faint whiff of shit around the whole media experience
//Hollywood, I loved the eighties, saw all the coolest movies. You don't need to milk it for $$$$ again. You can get it on DVD cheap.
@AnderWriter Play Borderlands. It's the same thing, just $15 cheaper. More if you buy it used.
Badass is not an acceptable character trait. It isn't a personality.
One day...one day...
A reminder for those who feel powerless, who have lost hope...you're stronger than you think you are. And somebody cares about you.
@_DownToEarth I imagine that would require a few thousand flowers...
Happy Mother's Day! 
*big grin*See, DC? I still matter. I may not be important to you, but other people still care.
//I love you google. Now I want to know what "A Throne of Games" is. Just because
//Stress level is soooooooo high right now...
Today, brave forces from all over the globe won a great battle for justice, as today...today is VE Day.
//"Even better idea, lets have him work the graveyard shift!" "Yeah, fuck that guy!"
//"Let's screw over that guy as much as possible!" "Yeah, it's finals week, so lets give him as many hours as we can!"

I believe in a world of hope, and ideals and diversity. And I hope that DC learns.
To quote him:On every world, a crisis...A new apocalypse.A doomsday...a conclusion that never comes but continues to arrive.An endless EVENT
@riondylan They're Batman's supporting cast. They're characters who I ADORE. Cassandra, Stephanie, Tim, Selina...
Grant Morrison pointed out EVERYTHING WRONG. He created an optimistic, hopeful NAZI SUPERMAN. He showed the foolishness of editorial.
It was about the future. About hope. And about giving SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.
Know what else it fundamentally misunderstands? The past. The fans. And the Crises. It wasn't about worlds living and dying.
Superman's supporting cast.
Batman's supporting cast except for Alfred and Damian.
Harley Quinn. Pretty much every villain ever. Darkseid. The entirety of the New Gods.
The characters the New 52 ruined: the Hawks. Superman. Wonder Woman. Everything from Earth-2. The Amazons. The Titans. The JLA. The Lanterns
@InsaneScribe No. It fundamentally fucks up everything the character stands for and is an INSULT to William Moulton Marston's ideals.
@InsaneScribe Diana got hit BAD by the New 52. All of the Amazons did. And it's only getting worse.
@InsaneScribe It ruins 3 I like. Superman. Wonder Woman. Cyborg.
@InsaneScribe Just Batman. League is aight but I'd argue it absolutely RUINS some characters.
@AnderWriter If I wanted a bleak and miserable Cap, I would freaking read Ultimates. XD
@AnderWriter Films after Civil War with him as the main character CANNOT be bleak.
@AnderWriter Captain America and Superman, specifically should not and cannot be bleak. They are optimistic, hopeful symbols.
@AnderWriter And all the movies need to stop looking and sounding so depressingly bleak.
@AnderWriter -Ghost Riders. Bucky, Cap and Falcon... Rescue and classic Tony...
@AnderWriter The only things I want to see, I don't think we'll get... Miles and Peter. Carol and Kamala. Don Blake and new Thor. -
@AnderWriter Post secret wars looks bleak for me as a Spidey fan. They confirmed MOAR GWEN STACY! *headdesk*
@AnderWriter It helps that I can look beyond the hype and flashiness to see what's left. Though it helps to have 0 expectations
@AnderWriter I have seen the future, and it doesn't look good for comics. :/ Not at all.
@AnderWriter Something we can agree upon! Although I'm not excited with either company's future at this point, both comics and films.
Everybody lives, Lois. Just this once...EVERYBODY LIVES!!
Today's comic of the week? ROCKET GIRL, hands down. How do you beat 1980s New York, Time Travel and Jetpacks? (You can't even try)
That's more like it! No fighting...trust. A happy ending I can live with! (Literally)
@AnderWriter I like it because it's a change of pace, and fuses the two things I enjoy about Thor books. I expect it won't last, though.
@AnderWriter Depends on what you are reading the comic for.
Never get between a man and his dog. *grin* Good dog. 
@InsaneScribe Every single book sold out at my shop. Every issue. Even stuff like the Atom.
@InsaneScribe I think there are a few that sold pretty well.
Isn't tonight a school night? 
@InsaneScribe Exactly. I expect those books to not sell well, but I expect that EVERYTHING old outsells anything new.
@InsaneScribe It's people like me who read those books.
@_Prime_Earth_ //Of course! Boba Fett loves Mexican food!
@AnderWriter But that...that story is something special.
@AnderWriter Just you wait. I have her EVERY APPEARANCE...until they ruined her when Andreyko took over. :/
@AnderWriter Do you have the whole set?
//Happy Star Wars Day AND Cinco de Mayo! (Featuring Walgreens EXCLUSIVE Concept Boba Fett!) 

It's things like this that make every day worth living. Worth fighting for. You're stronger than you think you are. 
//He told me everything was gonna be okay. That there are always more happy days. That...that is why I NEED Superman. That's why I am him.
//I know he isn't real, but Superman saved my life, once when I was in a very dark place. He reminded me I'm stronger than I think I am.
@AnderWriter When heroes fight heroes, everybody loses

Good for you, Lois! 
@_DownToEarth Unfortunately, yes.
It's not the big things, it isn't saving the world. It's the small, everyday things that matter most. 
#StarWarsDay 
"@SuperheroFeed: Ask yourself: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object." They surrender

@AnnLaabs That's why I love Superman. It isn't the big things, the battles, it's the little things, like that
DC, I would be disappointed if I cared. But I don't, and I'm not terribly surprised. #NOMORE

The real heroes aren't ones in flashy costumes, they're those brave men and women who do heroic things every day.

She is -my- superhero. 
So many stories...stories only I remember now.
Badass does not a good character make. It takes heart, and personality. Badass is a character trait, not a character.
Please, please, PLEASE let super villains ham it up and chew scenery? That's how they did it in my day, and they mostly stuck around.
@InsaneScribe Nothing tops Ultron himself. But I gotta say, somehow, this movie made me like Stark as a character.
//Having WAYYYY too much fun with Exo Zombies. Bill Paxton. John Malkovitch. It's GLORIOUS
@InsaneScribe It was okay. Ultron was GLORIOUS. Hammy, overacting and chewing scenery like a champ. Barton was great too

@zoraida_merlo One day, I hope everyone can read comics and find what they want. I dream of a day with comics for everyone.
No more events. No more marginalizing readership. No more ostracizing women. No more damaging characters. No. More.
It's time to put my foot down. No more.
@zoraida_merlo Nobody is a minority. We're those who buy the product, we are those who get invested. Who care. And we will be silent no more
On every world, a Crisis. A conclusion that never comes, but continues to constantly, ceaselessly arrive. An endless, pointless event.
It's time to stop marginalizing a readership, DC. It's time to move on.
It is not just women who think Lois is an irremovable part of the DCU. Her stories and role in Superman is to emphasize his humanity.
The original World's Finest! #UnbreakableLoisLane 
#UnbreakableLoisLane 
#UnbreakableLoisLane 
The first thing that Superman Prime did, upon leaving the sun was bring back Lois. That speaks volumes that DC doesn't care to read.
It's not just me, who is unbreakable, but my Lois as well. #UnbreakableLoisLane 
Which is the way they want it, so...they get it. But, luckily for them... And for me...I will never be like them. 
What we've got here is...failure to communicate. Some men, you just can't reach. So, you get what we have here at DC.

First and foremost...I am Clark. And I always will be.
We NEED Lois Lane...and more importantly, I -need- my Lois. Why? Because I'm not Superman...I am Clark Jerome Kent. 
Your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth and tell the whole world "No. You move."
No matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move,
This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe.
To quote a good friend of mine, it doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right.

A Superman needs his Lois. Not because he loses his Super, but because he loses his Man.
Proof that Batman has a heart 







"Superman doesn't have time for a lost dog" 

Remember when I took out Hitler? 





//FYI, Pitcher Matt Harvey's nickname is the Dark Knight. Hence the Batman theme



Never allowing myself to lose control even for a moment, or someone could DIE.
I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard, always taking constant care not to break something, to break SOMEONE.
The strange blue world to which my father sent me, if you knew how you were loved, not one of you would raise your hand in rage again.
@AnnLaabs Might I recommend this? It's old, and hard to find, but there are few stories better. 
@AnnLaabs There are many reasons to love the original power couple. For me, it was Crisis on Infinite Earths, and the old Earth-2.

Just don't BELIEVE in it.
Anger is EASY. HATE is easy. VENGEANCE and SPITE are easy. Lucky for YOU...and for ME...I don't LIKE my heroes ugly and mean.
When I decided to cross that line...to do what YOU DO...I was TERRIFIED. I thought it would be TOUGH...but you know what?
Yes...they DID see, didn't they? They saw all the ugliness. The anger...and I bet it FRIGHTENED them. It frightened ME.
"Everyone saw what you did to us and they know! They know you're NO BETTER! There's nothing SPECIAL about you!!
"Y-you can't do this! You...you're SUPERMAN...you don't...you don't DO THIS. Y-you...they saw! Everyone on earth SAW, you degenerate!"

One. Two. Three strikes. You're out. 
I just sent your friend to space, at Mach 7. 
Luckily, I'm not you. And I never will be. 
I believe.
I think that the modern Clark should grow his hair out. Once his single curl comes in, he'll start to remember who he is supposed to be.
The best of us. 
*grins toothily*



@AnderWriter He still has the glaring problem of having no neck, however
//Has anybody else noticed that the new film Batman has no neck?



//Avengers ends the WEEK of their US movie premier. FF ends and everyone loses their mind!

How does it feel, Dan? How does it feel to be deconstructed? To be the victim?! To watch your dreams DIE?
//STOP GIVING BACK THE LEAD BARTOLO!
Like Batgirl? Zatanna? The Justice League? How about Stargirl? The Atom? Dr. Fate? The Flash? The Justice Society? Thank Gardner Fox!

//Movie Masters HENRY CAVILL SUPES CAN DO IT, BUT FLASH CAN'T
//I can get EVERY ONE of my Marvel Legends to stand on one leg. Not a single DC Direct/Select figure does

It feels like the company has a no Lois rule. Feel the love! 
Don't rush to get all that Avengers Money and then just forget your History and let darkness mold your memories like the Winter Soldier
So cheer up, don't look so perplexed Avoid another Jonah Hex Remember that your heroes got here first
They'll just look like they need some rest And make the audience depressed Enough to head for the bar
Not everyone's from Gotham They don't all need to be solemn 'Cause if there's no fun or jest
The world has loved your heroes for the past seventy years No need to change the heart of who they are
One last time, then. Let's make it count.
We owe so much of what we take for granted to Gardner Fox. #GiveCreatorsTheirDue
//Derpy running!

//So DC collectibles FLASH. Not bad for a figure. He's VERY well articulated. Can't stand well however. Looks awkward in some more-
//I forgot, my Flash figure should be coming in today!
Starting to think I should use the Miracle Machine once more. We all deserve our happy endings. 

@AnnLaabs I believe that we can fix everything. Together. 
@AnnLaabs No. Not these days. But that's why I fight back, why I remember the old days so fondly. Because I DO remember it, unlike DC.

@baudyhallee There were still some I held out hope for. My last best hopes at DC fixing itself are Batgirl and Gotham Academy.
After all... I'm Superman. Never forget that. There is nobody I cannot beat and yet...I choose to reign myself in
I would never give up on Lois Lane. I would never let my friends sway me. I would never let the bad guys win. I would never stop fighting
I would never give up. I would never let myself cut loose with my powers. I would never lose faith. I would never stop believing in humanity
Superman would never...
Justice Society. Freedom Fighters. SHAZAM! Superman. Booster Gold. Multiversity. Princess Leia.
@baudyhallee I'm speaking with my money. Only Convergence. Post Convergence, nothing. Send them a message even they will understand
@baudyhallee I don't think the writers know. I also don't think the writers have read a Superman comic in their lives
The company has done more damage to me and my family than 72 years of villainous plots.
//I don't know who hates their fans more. DCE or the WWE.
//But no 40s and no main storyline. It isn't worth my frustration or energy.
//Sooooooooooooooo many comics. Sooooooooooooo many beautiful, pre-Crisis things today, I don't know where to start...
Gardner Fox. William Moulton Marston. Bill Finger. Gerry Conway. Give creators credit where credit is due.
Treat creators fairly DC. That logic might have flown in 1940, but now you're just being straight up evil.
@InsaneScribe If only DC believed as we do
@InsaneScribe -the grim darkness of the nineties, and by extension, now as well.
@InsaneScribe That's the point. "Heroes" like the Authority are incompatable with Superman and vice versa. That comic is a rebuttal to-
What's so funny about Truth, Justice, and the American way?
Personally, I think that maybe DC, and those they choose to write me, should go back and read Action Comics 775.

//Updated my PC, lost some of my stuff. Like ALL my PC games. GG
@BlindedAuthor He isn't THE greatest, that would be Jax-Ur. He isn't even a general, he just stepped up when Brainiac took Kandor.
It's not my power that makes me who I am. It's what I choose to do with it.
@SpyralsBatman //It should be the background of most of his stories!
@BlindedAuthor Not until he was a young man, when he was going through puberty...unless we count the Silver Age and earlier, then yes.
@BlindedAuthor He grew up with two hard working, middle class parents on a farm. Bruce is a billionaire, Diana is an Amazon princess...
@BlindedAuthor I recommend it, it's quite good.
@SpyralsBatman //But if you look at FCBD that's totally the opposite of what they're doing to poor Clark
@BlindedAuthor Not really. Clark Kent had the most normal, well adjusted childhood. The least baggage. He just wants to help people.
@BlindedAuthor -Hal is Mr. Authority. Case in point: GL GA
@BlindedAuthor Approachability is emblematic of humanity. Mostly because Hal is never there these days, but oldschool league stuff-
@BlindedAuthor That would be Cap. It isn't about the great power, it's about the personality.
@BlindedAuthor -approachable, but Wally even more so, back in the day.
@BlindedAuthor or Barry or King Arthur. And Vic essentially does nothing on this current league anyway. Barry I will give you is fairly-
@BlindedAuthor Not specifically N52, but the FIRST person on the league to be approachable of the common people? Certainly isn't Hal-
@BlindedAuthor it's very true. Read any Justice League story. If BATMAN makes more of a human connection, you're doing it wrong.
Truth. Justice. The American way. That's what I believe in. That's what I stand for.
Why am I so human? It's how I was raised, on a small farm in Kansas. That simple. I'm just like you, a writer with a vision of hope.
By the way, writers... You don't need to "explore my humanity." I'm already human, moreso the other Leaguers.
Still works just as good now as it did in the nineties and the beginning of it all. Superman and Lois Lane. 
It's good to see a world where everything just went right. The way things were meant to be.
ALL things...
Infinite worlds with infinite versions of me, fractured as through a lens, a prism. All things...come from Superman and his Lois Lane.
Even someone who can capture an entire city is no match for Superman indeed!
A world...not unlike that one was once my home. That...Superman, once, was just like me. With a niece, and a wife...I must say though...




I...I remember... 

@ShayneCaffrey True, but I'm referring specifically to the period immediately after the first crisis, ending at 1989.
@FabledArrow Do you know how easy it is for that logic to become why you should kill the person?
@VexingDetective -I stood for.
@VexingDetective In context, it was one of the toughest fights I had ever faced, a team of "heroes" who killed,and who perverted everything-
@FabledArrow @VexingDetective That's easy to do, Ollie. To let yourself get angry and mean. What is hard is to show restraint.
@VexingDetective It's something to remember these days. Especially when we all seem to have moments where our heroes are ugly and mean
@InsaneScribe Precisely. My rebuttal to everything modern. I don't like my heroes ugly and mean. I just don't believe in it.

@ActualHuntress @AnderWriter The thing is...they are ALL that way. Hollow shells, the N52 writing style and writers plastering over new-
At least some good news. They've moved from Golden Age to Silver Age with Divergence. In a few years, it'll be the Bronze Age again.

@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee They are. They never learned the hard lessons of the nineties, like Marvel. They'll learn. Trust me.
@baudyhallee @zoraida_merlo Yikes...
But I...I remember...the infinite earths...
Why is that what we got? Because universes lived, and universes died. Barry died. Kara died. And that was all that mattered to them.
What did we get out of it? The death of Sue Dibny. Death of Jason Todd. Paralyzed Barbara. Atlantean Sorceress Kara Zor-L.
by anybody, with anybody. Infinite possibilities! That was the promise, the HOPE of Crisis. Which was A VERY optimistic event.
Instead of ONCE A YEAR meetings between the JSA and the JLA, you could have both AT THE SAME TIME. New characters like Ted could be used
Crisis was a big deal, not because universes lived and universes died, but because it was about PROMISE. The multiverse was gone.
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee -and said: people only buy when people die, when something big happens. They set themselves up for failure.
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee DCs entire strategy is events and shock value. THATS why we get bs like Doomed and Truth. They looked at comics-

@baudyhallee @zoraida_merlo -coming soon, that day of reckoning, when even those they thought they had...they too will leave.
@baudyhallee @zoraida_merlo It won't be for long. Batman fans are pissed. Wondy fans are pissed.Harley, Lois, Superman...One day, and it is-
@baudyhallee @zoraida_merlo They can. Let the money speak for us. They won't listen to us as people. They will through the Jacksons.
@_DownToEarth It hurts me, what they do to things I like. I want them to succeed, SO BADLY...
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee One day, they will.
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee No, I agree with you. I was raised the same way. I'm a SUPERMAN fan.
I want these characters to live in the hearts and minds of children and adults, fans and pop culture FOREVER.
I complain and criticize and dislike DC's "new direction" because I LOVE DC. I love these characters. And I want them to live forever,
I complain, I criticize, not because I hate DC or because I'm a Marvel fanboy or because I want them to fail.
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee I know a way they can fix everything. Kal-L. The ORIGINAL Superman. All we need is a willing, decent writer.
@baudyhallee One movie (thus far) two lackluster ongoing series...and yet Superman is still going strong. Still beloved.
@baudyhallee Thats their problem. He will never go away.
@baudyhallee Characters, after a certain time, come to have a life of their own.
@baudyhallee Maybe they don't like the color green that my money is? It is VERY green and covered in dead presidents.
@baudyhallee The audience they want don't have the capital DC wants and needs. DC is stuck with those of us with jobs and lives.
@WriterOfHope Nothing I'll see, ever. I'm done with DC. Comics and movies until things change. Still get collectibles though. #Toyaholic
@WriterOfHope I read some. He occasionally sacrifices canon for "interesting" stories. Hardcore fans tend to be up in the air on him.
@GCsFirstBatboy *whispers* ASBAR
The Frank Miller obsession's getting a little extreme if we're using ASBAR as source material
@AnderWriter Thats why so many people, myself included are just so done. Done until something changes.
@AnderWriter The creepy obsession with Miller at DC NEEDS to stop. They're isolating fans.
@AnderWriter Somebody involved REALLY likes Frank Miller.

@lwsseymour It's a little consolation, but still not very good for fans of Lois, such as myself.
@WriterOfHope It's been a BAAAAAAAAAAD day today.
@WriterOfHope I'm a white guy too, but I grew up in a VERY Jewish neighborhood, so that has VERY negative connotations in my circle.
@WriterOfHope 15 out of 10 on the offensive scale
@BlindedAuthor It's worth a read, one of my favorite stories ever. But all the stuff that came after wasn't good, at all.
@BlindedAuthor TDKR is, to be perfectly honest, GOOD. Very good. But nobody, Frank included, GETS WHY.
@baudyhallee @zoraida_merlo I believe the middle bit.
Frank, I used to like and respect you. But that subtitle. VERY VERY poor taste there DC.
@zoraida_merlo @baudyhallee Why am I not surprised? Once upon a time though, Frank loved Supes. Just look at Superman 400
@baudyhallee I don't think they will, to be honest.
@lwsseymour I hope so as well. But then again, I'm a big old school Superman fan, optimism is my middle name by now.
@lwsseymour I'm tending to read only Star Wars from Marvel. But if you're looking for a good indie comic, I recommend Rocket Girl.
@baudyhallee -interesting indeed at my LCS. Beloved, no longer referenced characters like Steph and Wally are DOMINATING sales and reorders
@baudyhallee It already isn't helping them. Convergence is a small boost to shops in general, but the sales numbers...they are very -
@lwsseymour -income to spend on comics and films and collectibles. Welcome to the boycott movement. Together we will change things at DC.
@lwsseymour -but fans like myself, who have been reading comics for 20 years are the ones who buy the most. We have the most disposable -
@lwsseymour You're absolutely right, they DON'T want us as customers. But the customers they want tend to not buy much as it is, but-
@baudyhallee -looking so got at my LCS. Down about 35-40% so far.
@baudyhallee I don't think so. I think things will be SO BAD by this fall that we get another reboot. Preorders for post convergence aren't-
@baudyhallee -hell will break loose as they ask "how could this happen?"
@baudyhallee This summer, it's looking the bottom will fall out on sales. They'll go lower and lower and lower for shock value. Then, all-
What do you get for the man who has lost everything? 


The world's finest super team! 

This is how you treat us, DC 
When you want to treat my beautiful Lois and I with respect again, give me a call. I can write a great Superman.
They WILL listen to us. One person, alone is weak. But TOGETHER we can move mountains.

@InsaneScribe -to talk to me with respect as the person who has been buying long term. We deserve better than them:
@InsaneScribe Nope. Never again. The are not getting a dime of my money ever again unless they stop jerking off to Batman and want to talk-
@InsaneScribe How they did it is bullshit. I'm just fucking done.
Have fun watching your sales numbers collapse under your bullshit.
And the best part? You did this to yourselves, assholes. You brought this down upon yourselves by testing your faithful long term market.
@InsaneScribe He certainly isn't fixing Superman, if you look at the Superman spoilers from FCBD.
That's THE last straw jackasses. Good riddance and fuck you DC. No comics. No movies. Fuck off.
//Frustration with DC...RISING...
@AnderWriter It's gonna suck
//If they could do ONE THING to make me super happy...make a He-Man movie.
Stop trying to get people to buy Number Ones DC. They already do it. You need to get them to buy Number 300s.
@InsaneScribe And what DC wants is NEVER what fans want.
The last good event DC gave us was Crisis on Infinite Earths
@InsaneScribe Nah, we'll get whatever the actress gives us. Personally, knowing how shitty DC is, we'll get Arkham/N52 version
@InsaneScribe Yay more magic plastic surgery!
@InsaneScribe Nah, he'll become more and more and more prominent BECAUSE of Suicide Squad
@InsaneScribe LOLNOPE
@AnderWriter "NEEDZ MOAR JOKER!"- DC
@AnderWriter Of course not, don't you realize he's gonna be a huge part of Suicide Squad next year?
@AnderWriter Endgame was kinda the last straw for me, I just gave up and walked away after one issue.
@AnderWriter -the Joker was FUNNY. But a bit before Begins and until now, Joker is simply scary, because that's how the movie did it.-
@AnderWriter Both have gotten exceptionally egregious as of late.
@AnderWriter -the other one refers simply to the Joker going from a sort of chaotic clown themed villain to this bizarre clowny mastermind.-
@AnderWriter Very similar to me. My two biggest issues are what I call "Joker seep" and "Scary Clown." When I was a kid, and until TDK,

@CloisLover luuuuuuuuucky!
Nothing to give you back hope...like looking backwards, upon generations past.
They keep insisting I have. But to be honest...only they really changed. My last big change was no killing! And increased powers, but still.
They sure love trying to screw me over though. But I remain hopeful. I need to. After all, I haven't truly changed much since 1939.
It's never the end. Never. After all..I'm Superman!

@AnderWriter Hmmm. Not a big fan of that Wondy. Might take a look at Hawks though
@InsaneScribe Titans was one of the first books I got into after Supes and Spidey because of my cousins. He also did DC's only good event
@InsaneScribe Forgot about that. I think I pulled just that and Titans

@WriterOfHope Physical. I buy NOTHING digitally. Print or GTFO
@WriterOfHope I bought it...
@WriterOfHope Uhhhh
@AnderWriter I got my Batgirl and Gotham Academy, but other than that, I have a 6 issue mini: Bat-Mite. That's about it
@InsaneScribe Star Wars will eat Dawn of Justice for breakfast and wash it down with some Age of Ultron. That's how big it's gonna be.
@AnderWriter The way I see it, they were the biggest budget things with the most underwhelming trailers. So therefore, they should be best.
One day, I hope that they will join me, in the sun. Luthor saw, before the end. Perhaps, one day, they too will understand.
@AnderWriter Calling it right now, best movie of the year will be a toss up between Ant-Man and Star Wars.
I'm sorry, DC. After looking at everything post Convergence... I am, regretfully, done. Especially done with your shenanigans involving me.

@AnderWriter Be it cover wars, events, retcons, films...where comics go, controversy follows.
@AnderWriter When ISN'T there massive controversy about comic boos?

Of the entire league? I am the one who is most in touch with humanity, I'm touch with reality. @ClassicLois definitely helps.
I am one of you, more than one of them. Know who is an untouchable, literal god to them? Batman.
I am a savior, a figurative god, but unlike what you have me be, there is no literal worship. There shouldn't be.
Please, let me FLY, don't shackle me down to your misconceptions and misunderstanding of me.
The only thing they do, they choose to do...is bring me down to their level.
I think I'm dropping both of my books post Convergence. A shame what they have done and continue to do to me.
Why Metropolis?

@AnderWriter Yes. Yes, it probably did involve quite a lot of that.
@AnderWriter They had to promise to not be DC and treat him like shit, I presume. Then fanboy over him.
You brought this upon yourself.

@InsaneScribe As someone who has detailed knowledge of how politics work...he sounds like an idiot, CONSTANTLY. Especially Civil War
@InsaneScribe ...oh my god, now that I think about it... Although my big issue with Millar is how STUPID he sounds when he uses politics
@InsaneScribe He's...not good. For me, probably a tie with Mark Millar, my archenemy
@InsaneScribe Mark Millar, Frank Miller, Jeph Loeb, Doug Moench and Judd Winnick are all your nemeses then, huh?

@zoraida_merlo 1961. I've been reading both for a very, very long time.
@zoraida_merlo It's a game he has been playing for a loooooooooooooong time.
@zoraida_merlo -the only character they are REALLY trying to sell is Batman
@zoraida_merlo -confined to boxes and panels without context on Tumblr. By doing so, I think DC constrained itself to seeming as though -
@zoraida_merlo It was, somewhat. I miss a lot of what DC used to be. Characters I used to like, diverse characters...they're all gone, -
@zoraida_merlo DC itself seems to agree with Stan, except when they can't put Diana on a boys t shirt.
@AnderWriter He only ever wrote those 3 for his Just Imagine! Series. And he's like 93 years old

@CloisLover Because it's fall?

A Superman must always have his Lois. It needs to be, otherwise, he forgets the most important things

@AnderWriter &lt;sarcasm&gt; Because it's all about the online multiplayer, WOO!
Against my better judgement...even I'm kinda excited for my first movie with Bruce. I just wish we had the chance to see it earlier.
The real reason Batman wants to beat me up is because in my day, I embarrassed him at baseball.
*Batman's thoughts:* You better call him out, old chum. Robin: SSSSAAAAFE! *Superman fist pumps* 
@CloisLover Sounds like DC's worst nightmare!

Bruce, you IDIOT. You'll ruin EVERYTHING. For ALL of us. I always knew you would...
@WriterOfHope These days, it feels like we need more of those.
@WriterOfHope I would absolutely love to do that!
@WriterOfHope What I want to see will probably never happen: Golden Age Kal-L speaking to the modern Superman about the legacy.
@WriterOfHope Is it even worth reading the main story book? I read the first two and they were exactly the same thing.
@WriterOfHope It wasn't horrible, it was just kinda average. Not much really happened though. Or it felt like nothing really happened.
@WriterOfHope IMO, yeah. Like Atom, nothing happened in it.
@WriterOfHope He just resigned for 7 years, and I...don't think DC would be...very happy with his type of product
@WriterOfHope No, he's Marvel exclusive, has been his entire career.
//So how about the Mets winning? Or the Star Wars trailer?
//*sigh* And now all I will see and hear about now is BvS

@InsaneScribe They have one for a lot of things. Long overblown events. Heroes fighting heroes. Batman

@InsaneScribe Everything we love will be destroyed. Because it's destroyed.

@InsaneScribe Thor, JLI and Parallax.
@WriterOfHope I, as someone who likes/liked her, found it came down to: Good Lord, is that what Canary is in this? LOLNOPE
@AnderWriter His first comic was the SHAZAM: The Monster Society of Evil graphic novel. And now he wants to write for a living
@AnderWriter You need to do it when they're little. I'm 9 years older than my brother and I started when he was 3. He still loves the medium
@AnderWriter Now that my brother is 16, we're doing it together with the Walking Dead. Still tons of fun. I do fun accents and stuff.
@AnderWriter The ONE DC book I can still do it with is Batgirl. But you, uh, don't really want to hear my falsetto.
@AnderWriter -and I did it because my cousin Chris did it to me. Spider-Man and Superman. They have been with me ever since.
@AnderWriter Joker, Zod, Luthor, Deathstroke, Flash, Nightwing, Cass, the entire Titans...I can't do that with my nieces and nephews anymore
@AnderWriter Exactly. When my brother was little, I read a LOT of comics with him. I did and honed voices for everyone who appeared.Metallo-
@InsaneScribe Serious and fun. Monumental and small. That's why he would be perfect. He did Steph for tons of awesome stories.
@InsaneScribe Bryan Q. Miller. He'd be a great person to set the tone.
The ONE thing I want most from DC are comics I can happily share with my nieces and nephews, and younger cousins without being "too kiddy."
@InsaneScribe Anyone who has respect and love for the Pre-Flashpoint universe has my vote.
@InsaneScribe That would be the best thing ever. Best crossovers ever. So much happiness and light colors I could die of joy.
Justice Society TV show. All the oldschool characters, each episode putting a different character in the limelight.
@InsaneScribe DC doesn't want people wanting to read more of characters they are trying to bury forever
@InsaneScribe I just want to see Kyle, as a green lantern, written by somebody who gives half a fuck.
@InsaneScribe It means they actually paid people to do art who don't already regularly work for them. Much like writing
@AnderWriter No clue what I'm reading post Secret Wars though. Or..of Secret Wars. I hate events. No more events.
@AnderWriter I only read Spidey and Thor plus Star Wars from Marvel. Everything else is independent. Mostly Image
@AnderWriter I'm sticking with 2 things I ACTUALLY LIKE: Batgirl and Gotham Academy.
@AnderWriter I miss what we had before... So very much.
@AnderWriter Who else is gone? Kate and Mags, Plastic Man and wife... A lot of good characters, sacrificed.
@AnderWriter And oh so many more...because Dan and Jim got divorced.

@AnderWriter I liked her fair enough. There were some pretty bad issues though
@AnderWriter What's wrong with Dolphin?
@AnderWriter For my Mario. It's blocks and a stand. It'll look great on the shelf!

@AnderWriter That's that week.
@AnderWriter Action, Beetle, Booster, CSA, Infinity Inc, JSA, Freedom Fighters, Captain Marvel, world's Finest.
@AnderWriter NTT looks good, I forgot that one, but otherwise that's it for me. Need to save $ for the next one
@AnderWriter Yup! Next week. I have that and Legion. Then the week after I'm getting pretty much everything.
@AnderWriter I'm waiting for the pre-Crisis Supergirl.
//Also THOR

@SpyralsBatman //It's in the solicit for part 2. I haven't read the first bit yet.
@SpyralsBatman -with Nightwing, and in that he's with Kori.
@SpyralsBatman //No freaking clue. Nightwing and Oracle has him, obviously and he's with Babs. Titans takes place, at the same time, also-
@SpyralsBatman //Dan hates Dick. Convergence loves not making up their mind about Dick. Two versions, simultaneously, in the same city.
@SpyralsBatman //Yeah, Convergence loves screwing with Dick. Doesn't matter which one
@zoraida_merlo Of course Bizarro would, he's everything modern Superman is not. Light, fun, a good heroic model.
The Company's problem is that they stopped making comics for their fans. They now make comics only for themselves. What they want, not us.
@zoraida_merlo In currently published comics, there are 3 Supermen who care. Earth 2. Smallville. Injustice. It's astounding.

Even my villainous counterparts are allowed their happiness. My duplicate who took over the world in hopes of eliminating crime...he
Just because YOU can't be happily married, Dan and Jim, doesn't mean WE need to be that way. *angry glare*
//No comics this week! MORE CASS AND STEPH BACK ISSUES! :D
Plastic Man. Uncle Sam. Lian Harper. Lois Lane. Red Tornado. Donna Troy. Wally West...
Sorry Ma, Billy, Jay, Alan... You, much like me, have been forgotten and pushed aside in favor of what is "modern" rather than timeless.
75 years of Captain Marvel. Where are HIS theme covers, hmm? But no, we can only celebrate Batman and his villains!
Once the point was to make us into the Pre-Crisis past. Now the point is to eliminate the past
We do not need a Convergence. We need red skies and more people willing to accept a past.


@JasonRempala Yes. I had an idea for a JSA TV series, with a different character in the limelight each week.
@JasonRempala You're welcome. I'm a big fan of the Society.
I cannot wait until someone with my sensibilities is in charge. That...that would be a day I would rejoice.

@AnderWriter You have ten seconds to comply...
@CrimsonQuiver Most people who have seen me forgot about me...until the skies were filled with other earths.
@InsaneScribe Exactly. Maybe they are worth so much because DC treats them like shit
@InsaneScribe Not even kidding, Steph and Cass are the highest priced figures in the secondary market. More than ANYBODY else.
@FabledArrow ...Hmmm. Most interesting.
@InsaneScribe *headdesk* Cassandra Cain's 80 dollar figure and Stephanie Brown's $199 figure want to beat the shit out of him for stupidity
//PLEASE DC. MAKE THE ANIMATED BATGIRL FIGURE NOT SUCK BALLS LIKE THE OTHER ONES IN THE LINE. PLEASE.
@InsaneScribe I wonder if he remembers that DC got through the 90s by PROVING WHY THE 90s TRENDS WERE STUPID
@CrimsonQuiver I'm the, ah...older...version of Superman. Do you remember when you were on the Titans, and the skies were red?
@FabledArrow You remember?
@CrimsonQuiver There exists, above us but connected to us, a place called Earth Prime, where a group of people write stories about us.
@FabledArrow -a chance, a day in the limelight.
@FabledArrow I saved the world, essentially on my own, twice. Both times when the skies were red. I remember scores more people who deserve-
@FabledArrow I'm with you there chum. "Art" isn't worth the cost.
@InsaneScribe "Hisssss, NOOOOOOO" He then covered his face like a vampire confronted with a crucifix.
@FabledArrow There are those who believe that true art, much like real life, must be angsty and miserable.
@CrimsonQuiver ...the...powers that be got involved. They believe that "true art" is angsty, and took away that which we cared for most.
@FabledArrow You married the girl of your dreams Oliver.
@CrimsonQuiver Even you, Roy. For a little while at least. You were content with Lian, a doting father.

@InsaneScribe My most anticipated is probably Kal-L, Supergirl, Shazam, and Plastic Man
@InsaneScribe That's gonna be fun. I don't think I have -any- Convergence this week, probably not any until Pre-Crisis week
@InsaneScribe Yup! I'm trying to brainstorm a story with him fighting my Superman.
@InsaneScribe My idea was that the silliness of the silver age is toxic to him. He could be driven off by gorillas, or Batman smiling.

@BlindedAuthor -Frank became the head writer, wrote AWESOME stuff for DD until DC stole him, said "please write Batman" and he did it. -
@BlindedAuthor It predates all of that. Daredevil was selling shitty,put Frank Miller on art.Sells better but Miller didn't like the writer-

@BlindedAuthor Because of Frank Miller.

@BlindedAuthor I'll probably give it another shot once my finals are over.
@BlindedAuthor It's like watching Law and Order with Daredevil in it, at least the first episode.
@BlindedAuthor I think its the pacing and writing that didn't grab me
@BlindedAuthor The fight scenes are probably the best of any hero series too, it just didn't really hold my attention. No show has. :/
@BlindedAuthor I like Daredevil, I like his current series, I like Frank Miller's stuff. I saw episode 1 and it didn't grab me at all.

@AnderWriter Nobody knows. And frankly, at this point, I no longer care. Jason's somehow involved, so is Joker and Rick Flagg...
@AnderWriter Comic or film?
I don't particularly enjoy the Joker either. He's wildly overrated and...kinda boring. My favorite Batman villain is Penguin.
@WriterOfHope I miss when Superheroes were allowed to be super, and audiences would just accept it. With bright colors.

@AnderWriter -Wait for Multiversity to ACTUALLY END. Step 3: Invite back the previous series writers, IE. Miller on Batgirl, Simonson on -
@AnderWriter What -I- would have done: Step 1: spin it out of MULTIVERSITY, rather than 3 insanely low selling event comics. Step 2: -
@AnderWriter The entire story can be summed up as, to quote Godzilla (2014): "Let them fight."

@InsaneScribe At least we got Greg Rucka back. After that DC just said. "eh, close enough"
@InsaneScribe That would have made it sooooo much more awesome
@VexingDetective You know. Dealing with this situation we find ourselves in.
@InsaneScribe they kinda did on Earth 2, but that became all kinds of fucked up
@InsaneScribe The ONE thing I liked from Flashpoint was Thomas Wayne. But I also hate how they keep forcing it on us.
@InsaneScribe At the same time AMAZING and disappointing. The parts with Supes and Lois I loved. Flashpoint bits were HORRENDOUS
@InsaneScribe Birds of Prey was good in the early days of her run on that.
@InsaneScribe It depends what she was doing and what story. She did two of my favorite Wonder Woman stories ever
Convergence is in no way bad, it's just not what I was hoping for or expecting. But there are some surprises
@InsaneScribe There's no real substance to them. The Question is the best of the best. Seriously
DC. STOP. PUSHING. FLASHPOINT. It will always be just as over as Roman Reigns.
The worst of Convergence, Week 1. Nightwing and Oracle, and Justice League. They're pure nostalgia trips, but still very...N52. It shows
It felt good to see me again, even if the book as it was felt so very empty. Flying is the best feeling in the world.
The best of Convergence, Week 1. Batgirl and The Question. Philosophical, deep and EXACTLY what I wanted Convergence to be.

They are more plastic statues than figures I can mess around with. And stands are great, if I can USE THEM FOR DYNAMIC POSING.
rendered COMPLETELY useless by the sculpting you did on them! You can't really pose them at all, to the point they come with STANDS.

It is because of them that I am Superman. And that I am setting an example for everyone else to follow. A way to be better, to be...super.
My parents raised me to be something better and set an ideal I could meet, giving me a pattern I could bring into my heroics.
And killing! Don't get me started on that. Suffice it to say that in a world of jet powered apes and time travelers, killing doesn't work.
send when people's heroes are constantly at each others throats. We're better than that.
This constant infighting between heroes needs to end. It happened in my day, sometimes, but never like this. What kind of message does that
@ClassicLois  Perhaps. I thought you should know, Lex is going back to jail. This time for a very, very long time. *I wink*
#FF to the most beautiful, most intelligent woman I have the pleasure of knowing @ClassicLois 
@WriterOfHope This is what Vegetto will look like 
@WriterOfHope I think so. Oh, and the other one, Vegetto as well. But that one is SH Figuarts
@WriterOfHope My friend HATES Ollicity, so I got him both of them. I just wanted Ollie for myself
@WriterOfHope SSJ Son Goku I have, Android 17 is paid for but waiting on shipping, Gogeta is on order as is SSJ2 Son Gohan.
@AnderWriter I'm waiting to see if there's a collectible of that epic looking "Broken Ultron) that I'm assuming is from his first appearance
@WriterOfHope I'm waiting on the later this year Arrow (two of him, one for a friend) and I ordered a Felicity as a joke gift.
@AnderWriter and Way too many Marvel Legends. Mostly Spidey related except Cap.
@AnderWriter Lets see, what's in my order list right now: Gogeta, Figma Link, Figma Lucina, Mario Sets A&amp;B, Superman, Batgirl, TDKR Batman,-
@WriterOfHope Oh? Which ones?
@AnderWriter The only figures I am getting this year from DC (so far) are Jae Lee Superman and TAS Batgirl
//How many DC collectibles figures this year will NOT be Batman or in any way Batman related?
@ClassicLois Perhaps. I thought you should know, Lex is going back to jail. This time for a very, very long time. *I wink*
@ClassicLois You know it wouldn't do very much to me. *I smirk slightly, quirking an eyebrow*
@ClassicLois *I float down gently onto your balcony, just like I had done all those years ago* Ms. Lane?
@CloisLover Of course. Women don't exist to DC, but are highly valued by EVERY other company, even Image, Boom and Dynamite.
What's left, without a past, or a future? A perpetual limbo of "uhhh" and "errrr"?
You ended the past in 2011. And now you ended the future.
I think we've had enough cosmic, world shaking, status quo altering events. I think we've had enough events period.
//I miss you so much @ClassicLois.


A blessed Passover to our Jewish brothers and sisters.
I haven't had a proper face to face with this current generation of hero. I think it's time I do so, properly.
And I will be there to guide them, to welcome them with open arms, and to be a symbol, incorruptible, of the best we have to offer.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free...

Every time...SUPERMAN WINS. Brainiac knows this. Luthor knows this. And I win because I am never truly alone.
Why the fascination with splash pages and two page spreads? In my day, I sold books with even more pages of story than you.
3 Batmen couldn't change the future. But I bet I could.
They thought one man couldn't make a difference. But they were wrong, because I'm the one that changed everything.
I will save, not just my world, not just my city, not just my timeline but the whole multiverse. After all, I did it once before.
It's time for, not a twilight, but a new dawn. Rising. Not setting.


Thank you for that. For reminding me who and what I am. Why I'm here. After all... I'm SUPERMAN! 
This...THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR SUPERMAN! *shattering glass* 
@CloisLover I knew there was a reason I liked you. ;)
@InsaneScribe I loved the Batgirl one, it was so very different than what I was expecting
@InsaneScribe True. If anything I'm debating getting Gotham Academy Endgame tomorrow and not getting Gwen. I dunno. I'll figure it out

@AnderWriter Because they drove him away.
//Huh...only Spider-Gwen and 9th Doctor this week. Yay me! I -could- get Convergence, but I don't really care about the hunger games plot
Maybe apes, all kinda of apes, would help lighten the tone. Captain Carrot is a great help, but it just needs...more,
@AnderWriter Look at some early JSA or late Justice Society of America. It stands out from the other books. That's all I want.
@AnderWriter House style works for some things, but it makes it hard to make a book really unique, and stand out
@AnderWriter -into a big lump of art that all looks EXACTLY the same
@AnderWriter To be honest, I wish there was more...artistic diversity. You get some stuff like Hawkeye or Batwoman, but a lot of it blends-
@AnderWriter Not really. It depends on what you like. I despise most modern DC art, but I love Mike Allred's simplistic style a lot. *shrug*
//I love and miss you so much @ClassicLois. So much.
Well chum, maybe with my influence, and some from the masters of heroism, maybe we'll rub off on you by next year.
@CloisLover they're both pretty freaking awesome.
@CloisLover Nope, mine is.

If things had turned out differently, would I even be, what I am now? Would I still be Superman, without someone to remind me of my human
I find myself sometimes wondering what could have been, what I would have been without her. All the questions left unasked, unanswered.

@AnderWriter I can't believe I forgot Aquaman today...
@AnderWriter I have 4 issues so far, and it's awesome.
@AnderWriter if you can get it, I recommend the 20-odd issues of Captain America No More. It's one of my favorite stories ever.
//*headdesk* I forgot Aquaman...

@AnderWriter Not necessarily. (I am a BIG fan)

@AnderWriter A lot of stuff for ~ $30
Like an issue that has a story for each of a few major characters, that is done so as to be appropriate for all ages.
a one and done story, but then like THREE MORE with different characters.
Know what we need? An oversized anthology series. That way, people don't need to spend an ungodly amount of money on a story arc, they get-
@AnderWriter I think it would be a smart idea, and showcase other characters for once.
@AnderWriter Maybe, but I was thinking about making it a bigger book, maybe $5 but once a month, and 50 pages instead of 22
@AnderWriter -have ongoing series/established character and have them do something. But a different team every month.
@AnderWriter I loved the Mighty Avengers team, but my idea was a separate Avengers book, where a randomly selected team of characters who-
@AnderWriter Essentially EVERYONE is an avenger, we should see more than just the same few, imo.
@AnderWriter Avengers characters, and yet we see so few in recent comics. It's kinda sad.
@AnderWriter They have been members for longer, even if they fell out of favor recently. She's aight, but there are so many great female-
@AnderWriter Captain Marvel. Scarlet Witch.
@AnderWriter She-Hulk.
@WriterOfHope Eeeyup.
@WriterOfHope The modern universe, at least, as it as a whole dates back to the Timely days with Cap.Modern wouldn't have existed without FF
@WriterOfHope I love how Star Lord is there, but Cyclops isn't. WTF

//That moment when you have a great idea for a UN and someone took it. And hasn't used it since 2012
@AnderWriter Only the last several issues. Everything before that sucked major ass.
@WriterOfHope Goten is awesome. I always loved Freeza and the Androids, they were great arcs but soooooooooo long.
@WriterOfHope What's your favorite DBZ arc? (I noticed you RTed my Jinzoninjen) XD
//THE RED RIBBON ANDROIDS 3-IN-1! :D 
@WriterOfHope I did. XD It totally got the point of what Superman is, and it was beautiful
//*sighs, starts to rip up bracket*
@AnderWriter They are roughly equivalent as in the N52 they are the same character, save with an age difference and exposure to the sun.
@AnderWriter Depends on what continuity we're talking about
@WriterOfHope He keeps getting corner trapped by the infinitely respawning Appule. I love only when Gohan is Saiyaman. XD
@WriterOfHope I haven't beaten his body swap mission yet, Gohan keeps dying in Frieza's ship
@WriterOfHope I wonder if Ginyu or Frieza have missions? Theirs would probably be epic
@WriterOfHope Yup, you help him kill Yamcha, Tien, and all those other guys. What if Nappa and Vegeta won on earth. XD
@WriterOfHope Nappa has a really fun mission for his.
@AnderWriter Ghost Rider, the all female team book and Renew your vows I think are it for me
@AnderWriter I think we all are confused af about it
@WriterOfHope Lol. Figures are at a predictable scale: 6" no matter what, for the most part. Statues vary wildly
@AnderWriter If only there was a guide like that to secret wars...
//A week of manga purchases! It's been a while since I bought this much 
// #SOON 
@WriterOfHope It looks pretty dope, but the prices of their statues are kinda prohibitive for me. Also a tad big for the shelf
@WriterOfHope I know, Japanese figures are super awesome. Hopefully I get my $60 Mikasa figure soon, that looks so dope
@WriterOfHope This is my Android 17 figure from Bandai. He's a bit more expensive now, cuz he's old. 
//Today's comics!: Two volumes of Attack on Titan, 2 Batgirl issues, Princess Leia, Superman, Supergirl, Spider-Man, and Thor
//DC's idea of a $60 figure sucks compared to Japan's... Hell, Bandai's $30 DBZ figures are better than DC's $60. WTF?
@WriterOfHope Superman and Supergirl were awesome today, and oh so very human.
@WriterOfHope Supes was awesome today.
@WriterOfHope You're welcome! It's what I use, and it has EVERYTHING.
@WriterOfHope 
@InsaneScribe That will be interesting to see. I don't know how much he'll be in it though, solicits only mention "Batman"
@InsaneScribe I'm getting...3 books: Superman, Golden Age Superman and Batgirls.
@InsaneScribe That's precisely what DC's own team is projecting as well
@BlindedAuthor Exactly! But they're from that weeeeird time in the 90s when they were actually cool.

@AnderWriter -we're getting a VERY small number of people trying to do it.
@AnderWriter -filmography is that we -won't- get that at all. And unlike how the DC universe was built from the minds of many,
@AnderWriter -of the Marvel universe is that they OFF THE BAT, established rules for how the universe works. Based off of Snyder's past-
@AnderWriter I think, right now, Snyder is all we have to make that universe. And that's a problem. The genius of Watchmen (the comic) and -
@AnderWriter -make money, guaranteed, but there's more at play than that, especially on the back of the divisive Man of Steel.
@AnderWriter -set up for numerous cameos and references...and all -very- quickly. They should wait and see exactly HOW DoJ does. It -WILL-
@AnderWriter -are trying to quickly make a shared universe, but it feels like it's happening at the expense of individual characters to set-
@AnderWriter I'm worried about ALL their  films, I think they are all relying too heavily on two films to be linchpins. And I get why, they-
//Divergence is starting to make some more sense to me, I think. Infinite earths, infinite possibility. Also Atomic Batman. XD
@AnderWriter -widely known and used bad guys. They're riding the Nolan/Timm train to the bank, I think.
@AnderWriter -well, it's THE JOKER. They cast a guy who is visually reminiscent and similar to the TAS version, and is one of the most-
@AnderWriter What I worry mostly is that is EXACTLY what they will do, because Harls is kinda a golden goose right now, and because,
@AnderWriter Wouldn't surprise me if they were. And no need to apologize, I only know the kinda early stuff from that book.
@AnderWriter -recognizable villains in the DC universe. So I'm feeling they'll try to milk his presence and cast somewhat.
@AnderWriter I get the feeling they are both trying to do and avoid that at the same time, as Bats has some of the most instantly -
@AnderWriter I'm worried they will shackle it too much to him and his enemies, but if that's all it's gonna be, it won't be awful then.
@AnderWriter Kinda all over the place personally. I think Affleck will be a killer Batman, but I'm not sure he belongs in the SS film
@IcecreamGenius Thats a very good point actually. I hadn't considered that.
@IcecreamGenius -single tankobon, 4 or 5 issues of a regular comic at a fraction of the industry cost for American comics: $10 for 4
@IcecreamGenius Front end, it is a big cost, but to the consumer, trying to fleece you $5... It just seems odd to me. And you get, for -
@WriterOfHope I love Bleach, it's one of my top 5 series I'm currently reading.
@IcecreamGenius True, and I get that's part of it, but it still seems like an absolutely massive price difference for ink.
@WriterOfHope //It's universal price of $15.99 for the 3 volume sets, even of Dragonball, Rosario + Vampire, etc.
//I hate price differences. I can get about 300 pages of Bleach for $14.99, but it's like $20 for 200 pages of Superman. WTF?
//Personally, in my Headcanon, part of the Killing Joke DID happen, as it explains Earth-2 Joker's paralysis. XD
@BlindedAuthor -odd years of the Pre-Flashpoint universe, so it may have occurred partially, but not enough for the substantial growth.
@BlindedAuthor It can be interpreted as such, the current run makes some of the implications of it, but it tends to vary. It wasn't the 20-
CONSTANTLY. That is why it concerns me. And I hope people can understand that.
Killing Joke is still an important part of her character development to this day. To the point where it is shown, reflected and paralleled
several great series. But then the New 52 threw canon away. She was never Oracle, she never grew as a character, and yet, somehow, the

why it isn't, but that seems to be a bit of an issue. After The Killing Joke, Babs disappeared from canon for 6 years before she was

with one last story as a way to appease newly hired, former 2000AD artist Brian Bolland. Said story would go through several drafts, but
there was a HUUUUUUGE planned event, sort of like a last hurrah for the character. Those plans fell through, so writer Alan Moore came up

Happy pi day. No, Lex, that does not give you license to steal 40 cakes.
@WriterOfHope More than I care to think about.
@WriterOfHope Why am I cursed to root for bad teams? But hey, at least Knicks won today, 13 so far this season!
@WriterOfHope THAT WAS SO DOPE! Haven't had that much fun in so long. Reminded me a bit of All-Star
@WriterOfHope The worst part is I'm a Mets fan, a Knicks fan, and a Giants fan. *weeping*
@WriterOfHope Action was so much fun. Not even as a sports fan am I pleased. But I'm a New Yorker, sooooo...
@WriterOfHope Are ANY fans ever pleased? I can't think of any off the top of my head.
The world needs more smiles, more handshakes, more hugs... Maybe then my job would be much easier.

@BlindedAuthor Yup! I'm stoked

//I need a new manga to read. Hmmm... Any suggestions?


@WriterOfHope @CloisLover Precisely. I love Kyle, but that was so messed up. His Ion days were kickass, imo.
@CloisLover @WriterOfHope Because the then higher ups disliked her. Thought she was "toxic to the brand". XD
@WriterOfHope Treat it with respect, and make sure it has a purpose. Then I will have no problem at all.
@WriterOfHope I can agree with that.
@WriterOfHope That's really what bothers me most. Sexual assault bothers me, but the fact they tried to get rid of her entirely with it.
@WriterOfHope -was supposed to die. However, writer John Ostrander saved her from being written out of existence.
@WriterOfHope At the time, Babs was hated by editorial the way Dan hates Nightwing. So they tried to get rid of her character forever, she-
@WriterOfHope But you're right, it isn't the worst story ever, but it does have some points that are both bad and good.
@Kal_L_Superman: One bad day doesn't break a man. It makes one.
@WriterOfHope It is a) non canon, b) fridging a long standing character c) implied sexual violence. However, the good thing is Jim.
@WriterOfHope //To me, it's just remembering something very bad. Very stupid and very bad.
//I love how a NON CANON story manages to dictate a character, after a reboot and after being disavowed by the creator. *sigh*
//Just saw the Batgirl variant. My reaction, as someone who likes the new book, AND likes Barbara...this... 
//Oh, R+V, how I missed thee

And it continued, through iterations of both, neither remembered their pasts, but they always came together in the end.
forced them apart, but the god made a promise. No matter what, throughout time, they would always find their way back to each other.
Once, long ago, there was a mortal who loved a god, and the god reciprocated that love in return. Circumstances beyond eithers control
Hmmmm... I wonder if they're sending DC a message? 

@WriterOfHope Superman's new costume. Bizarro's ongoing costume is the opposite of new Superman's.
@WriterOfHope Correct!
@WriterOfHope It is indeed.
Son. I think it's time you and I had a talk.
DC, here's a note from teacher. Your grades are slumping, see me after class.
I don't usually quote the other companies films, but DC...YOU ARE FAAAAAAAAILLLING! Finch, you get a Z. 
Bizarro loves new costume! New costume is worthy of short history and awful legacy. 
Bizarro love New 52! So much happiness and recognizable characters, with long histories. Bizarro's new costume no longer look bad.
But now...Bizarro am everything Superman is. Bizarro not super fun, dull, dark or barely violent. Bizarro HATE Lois Lane, Bizarro worst hero
It's not hope, it's an immutable symbol of TRUTH, JUSTICE and the AMERICAN WAY? What's not to get about that!

//Attack on Titan volume 1 was...something. It isn't bad, it isn't good it merely is. It's Vol. 1 though, so it gets benefit of the doubt.

@ittakesageek The DC I knew and loved was all of those things and then some. It had something for everyone, a character for everyone.

@AnderWriter It would not surprise me in the least if they just switched who works on what between the two major franchises
@AnderWriter Not surprised. Kinda hoping it goes back to a small character driven thing instead of "the world is in danger and only YOU..."
//WHY AM I PLAYING FNAF 3 IN A FUNERAL HOME AT NIGHT? WHY DID I THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA!?
@ChocolateSupes //Once again marketing at both its best and worst.
@ChocolateSupes //Have you noticed how much Leto looks like the TAS Joker, at least in some angles? I think something stupid is going on
@ChocolateSupes -there is much more to it. But Hollywood, as well as DC has no clue what the real world is
@ChocolateSupes -that's when she sold well: In Batman TAS. To a marketing schmuck, that's all they need for success. In the real world-
@ChocolateSupes //Precisely. That's EXACTLY the message they have been trying to send all along. They associate her with Joker because-
//This is a first. NO comics at all this week
@ClassicLois I get just as much power from you as I do the sun, or eating a good meal.
@ChocolateSupes //Because Harley is in it. That's why the Joker is in it. Because to them, people who watch movies are dumb
@ClassicLois You make me both
@ClassicLois *I kiss your cheek lovingly*  You make me super
@AnderWriter I'm enjoying it, its essentially the "anti-N52" its very jokey and lighthearted
@AnderWriter They clone the Justice League in the future, but they all come out wrong. Now it's turning more into the OLD JLI.
@ClassicLois I think it's perfect
@ClassicLois I am. *chewing*
@ClassicLois Mmmm. Delicious. *slightly muffled by food* fank you bery much
//In case you can't tell, I love Nintendo. I also love Link and Samus most. They were there for my childhood, and will be there forever
//Welp. Hafta go to the stores again in a week or so... 
@ClassicLois Mmmm. Delicious. *slightly muffled by food*
@ClassicLois That sounds perfect to me. *I put my arm around you lazily*
@ClassicLois Fold your legs and put them up on the table, relaxing
@ClassicLois *I do thusly, calling a pizzeria and having it prepared for delivery* Aaaaaah, normalcy.
@ClassicLois How about we order Italian take in? Maybe some lasagne or manicotti, a tray of Caesar salad, some bread...
@ClassicLois Never, that's why I want it so much. *I smile slightly*
@ClassicLois Just being with you. Being...normal.
@AnderWriter George Lucas is right, we're heading for a crash that the industry is too blind to see exists yet,
@AnderWriter They're a symbol of the bigger problem. At least they would be if Hollywood pulled its head out if it's own ass. -
@AnderWriter Superhero/Action films, it's the ginormous budgeted blockbusters that come out CONSTANTLY, and make studios bleed money.
@AnderWriter Knowing Hollywood, there taking a HUGE risk with smaller budget films in a world of blockbuster films. The problem isn't -
@ClassicLois Well...
@ClassicLois You spend time with him. Every moment together is a treasure.
//Snow Day line study -Josephine Montilyet 
@ClassicLois You don't need anything for a man who has everything
@ClassicLois *I smile warmly and contentedly*
@ClassicLois I'm not -that- old...okay maybe I am. But you're just as old and immortal as I am by this point. An eternity together.
@AnderWriter Part of me wonders just what's going to go on in the next one. The Elves will probably be a huge part
@ClassicLois Is it that time already?
@AnderWriter OH GOD AND DORIAN AS AN ADVISOR. #BreakThemAll
@AnderWriter Even better if you're romancing Josephine or something.Just shatter EVERYTHING the Chantry stands for.
@AnderWriter It would be hilarious if my anti Chantry Dalish could become Divine."I am not the Herald. There is no Maker. IM THE NEW DIVINE"
@AnderWriter Yup. I don't agree with her, but I'm romancing Cas and the Warden deserves her happy ending. Also HAWKE LIVES!
//Thusly my Inquisitor became MORE of a time traveler, going back from 30 hours to 8 because I refuse to let Leli or Cass become Divine

Hummana Hummana
@WriterOfHope @OneTrueJames I'll just leave this here... 
@AnderWriter @CloisLover And she's also a highly trained marksman.
@AnderWriter Which episodes? I'm marathoning every episode with Leonard. Even that TNG cameo and the two AWFUL movies
@AnderWriter @CloisLover If anyone makes a move on her, pretty sure he'd throw them into Space, like he did to Lobo in BatmanSuperman
@CloisLover @AnderWriter Super vision AND super hearing!
@All52Superman //A few of them, but not all.
@All52Superman //Of course, that's not even the original roster of the team!
I spread my arms, turning my face to the warm glow of the sun and I smile, content.
intentionally flying past my beloved @ClassicLois' window at the building, zooming out over the world with my hair curl waving in the breeze
*Old and visibly worn, but unshakeable, I take to the skies of my beloved Metropolis once more, smiling down on my familiar Daily Star,
When the skies are red once more...we shall see... *cracks a small, faint smile*
But there are some people who remember the infinite diversity and promise of the infinite earths... Some who dare to hope
I shouldn't be like this, but this place corrupts legends...or destroys them. Even Uncle Sam lost his meaning here.
I'm a symbol of faith, hope. That people can be better. The living icon of the American Way...
*shakes head sadly* After all this darkness and despair, is it any wonder I have lost faith?


Boldly going...where no man...had gone before...
Rest in peace, Leonard. You earned it. Live Long and Prosper.
Our hero today. 
Our hero tomorrow. 
Never forget Christopher Reeve.

//I wonder how much I'd get from DAI if I turned it in for the Inquisitor Edition?
@AnderWriter //I'm happy, I like Julia way more than I should.
@AnderWriter //No, modern Spider-Girl wouldn't go back to 616, and MY favorite Spider-Woman is no longer Madam Web
//Welp,I'm lost a Spider-Girl but got back a Spider-Woman
@AnderWriter Nerys is still my main/canon run through. Mostly cuz Scribbles is an adorable romance and I love how good she came in creation
@AnderWriter I'm doing another run through of DAI. I'm a male elf warrior, because I want to romance Cass. I look a tad like Fenris
@AnderWriter Yes. But add a little more Motorized Patriot/Big Daddy and it's all good.
@AnderWriter *puts clenched fist over heart, while kneeling*
@AnderWriter PUT HIM ON THE IRON THRONE!

#amwriting 
@CloisLover :3
//Inquisition's minimum bullshit side quest o meter thing is pissing me off
@AnderWriter His writing is marginally better than his art
@WriterOfHope Everything people bitch about has a reason, and its glorious. Strongly recommend reading it, because it's so different
@AnderWriter Really awesome, enthusiastic dude, but can't draw for shit
@InsaneScribe Very Eleventh Doctor, with a tad of Two and Four
@WriterOfHope Dead serious.It's a REALLY good book that people refuse to look at because it's different.But it's giving me BATGIRL V. ORACLE
@WriterOfHope DC Batgirl and Supergirl are tied, Marvel is Captain Marvel herself.
@InsaneScribe I get that, I mean when fans interpret him as such. That's why he's such a good character, very complex.
@BlindedAuthor I literally fell out of my chair when he burned down the bank I was laughing so hard. He's so terrible at heroism.
@BlindedAuthor They did, but it was kinda the point of it. Carnage was the best though, just cuz it was freaking HILARIOUS!
@AnderWriter Is it any wonder she's one of my favorite characters of all time? So much continuity and character.
@BlindedAuthor That happened to a few other characters too (HOBGOBLIN) from the event.
@InsaneScribe That did sound really Booster-y, didn't it. I hate when people make him out to be an idiot.
@InsaneScribe Superman and Wonder Woman is WRONG! I hafta fix the Multi...oh my god...
@BlindedAuthor It honestly feels like it's a thing they said and forgot, IMO.
@InsaneScribe Yup! He's the only one pushing the plot forward, and has been doing it since the end of JLI
@BlindedAuthor It's part of the Main Axis thing, but it's kinda a plot point that never came up again
@AnderWriter Back when it was the best comic DC put out... *sighs*
@BlindedAuthor Maury moment. It just broke him even further.
//It's funny when the MOST IMPORTANT PERSON in the n52...isn't in it any longer




@ChocolateSupes -through the second one. It's much more my speed and kinda game, not much of a RPG player. Though I do love Mass Effect)
@ChocolateSupes Hell, I'd give anything to freaking Sandal back. Even having Varric by my side again feels empty though. (I got into DA-
@ChocolateSupes -the sunset, Hawke and Merrill stayed together, despite everything. That's how the last games ended, let them keep that.
@ChocolateSupes -part of the game. It's great to see them, but not having them there makes it...better. Warden and Leliana rode off into -
@ChocolateSupes "oh, you really liked this character? Too bad, screw you, the happy ending was pointless. Lel and Hawke didn't need to-
@ChocolateSupes -And even in stuff like final fantasy, you keep the ending you work for. Dragon Age doesn't give you that. It's like -
@ChocolateSupes //I get that I totally do, but I dumped about 90 hours into the first two, and it feels like I didn't make any difference-
-the second DAII ended. All the snarky good she did, the people she befriended, Merrill...it was all NOTHING. And DAI makes you feel it.
-my romance interest into a better, more open, more questioning person. -EVERYTHING- Hawke did was for naught. It all fell apart instantly-
//I get why DAI bothers me so much now. Because EVERYTHING I worked for was pointless. I spent a game saving the world and shaping Leliana-
//I FINALLY ADVANCED THE PLOT! *eye twitch* #DAI


@AnderWriter Likewise!
@AnderWriter -human and Dalish. Warden and Leliana, Hawke and Merrill.
@AnderWriter I'm torn on romance though, Sera or Josephine. I'm kinda leaning towards Josephine currently, keeping my pattern of -
//I still hafta get my hands on the Adam West Batman figure
@AnderWriter I have done the absolute bare minimum exploring, quest wise. I keep getting lost in some of the larger areas.
@AnderWriter I have no clue who Blackwall is yet, and Bull is totally useless to me, being an inferior me
@AnderWriter The -only- people I like are Varric and Josephine so far.
@AnderWriter I tend to use Sera (range), Dorian (board control), Cassandra (defensive) and myself. I'm a Dalish warrior.
@AnderWriter It was challenging, but I'd have more fun if I halfway liked any of my companions. :/
@AnderWriter Yeah. Ran out of potions just in time for the boss fight.
@AnderWriter 2 -weeks- were wasted on Alexius.
@AnderWriter I'm still in Haven, defending it from the generic bad guy's exceptionally generic army
@AnderWriter I can't beat the corrupted red lyrium templar at the end of act 1. It keeps kicking my ass.
@AnderWriter I FINALLY got to the end of ACT I of inquisition after like two months of struggle.
@AnderWriter Spider-Man 300 homage cover
@AnderWriter Not a bad haul. I'm gonna be killed by my preorder variant for Spider-Gwen though, $15 dollar 1:1000 cover.
@AnderWriter Vader 2. What are you getting on Wednesday?
@AnderWriter Aquaman, Arkham, Gotham Academy, He-Man, TASM, Vader, Spider-Gwen and the Thor annual. $28.92 worth of comics
@AnderWriter I have just under $30 and I'm picking up 3 extra books
Smiling is never a bad thing. It can brighten somebody's day, even if you aren't saving their life
@CloisLover Your favorite Smallville episodes?
@WriterOfHope @AnderWriter I already have tons. I get signatures and exclusives.
@WriterOfHope It's kinda like heaven then, huh?
@DemonsDaughter //What about narmily screaming for a martini, shaken, not stirred?
//The one con I haven't been to but want to go to so bad: Trek Con. I want to cosplay with my people and get Shatner's signature
//My brother just told me the way I sound when I'm losing my voice: "It's like Sean Connery mixed with Michael Shannon"
@AnderWriter It's totally worth it.
//If you come to NYCC there's one advantage: me. I'm like...maybe 20 minutes by train. And I know all the cheap, good shit (as a resident)
@CloisLover How about Luke Skywalker/The Joker, BATMAN and The Incredible Hulk?
@CloisLover I met Mark Hamill, Adam West and Lou Ferrigno!
@CloisLover Geoff Johns, Babs Tarr, Branden Fletcher, Cameron Stewart, Grant Morrison, Jason Aaron, Greg Pak, Stan Lee, Dan Slott...
@CloisLover Keep saving, and go to NYCC instead. It's bigger and has more meaning. Most of the stuff is about the root of it all: comics





//I'm gonna be mostly on Spidey today to avoid getting pissed at DC. If you need me, I'm mostly responses only.
@InsaneScribe No faith at all
@InsaneScribe Nothing, because there isn't anything. Not even the movies are worth it. DC just isn't worth it.
The one bright spot of hope, was raised under the bright colors of the big top.
@InsaneScribe Nope. After Convergence, I am just done.
I have seen what this world does to legends. It corrupts them...or it DESTROYS them.
DC I give you a Z-. Zero stars. We have given them a gift, that they have thrown away.
//Yeeeeeah, no. Sorry DC. I'm done with you, except for 4 things: Action Comics, Batgirl, Gotham Academy and Superman.
Happy Birthday Batman. 
//If you "hate" anime, look up Berserk. It is, in fact, an anime. Not mainstream, absurdly dark and violent...AND AWESOME.
//Batman and Robin is GREAT. I'm gonna miss Supergirl too, it's too god to get tossed aside
@CloisLover I need all of those
//Ordered my 4 convergence books today: Batgirl, Superman, Action Comics and JSA
@InsaneScribe MR. MIND. It should have been Mr. Mind! That would have been amazing.
@InsaneScribe Saw that coming from a mile away.
@InsaneScribe I don't care much about Hal. He's not my lantern. The costume is bleh. What did you think of Mastermen?
@InsaneScribe AMAZING, for the most part. The exception being Justice League, which was disappointing
//I have an idea...but I need an Uncle Sam. Hrm...
@WriterOfHope I am so glad I didn't spend money on that nonsense
//Comics, best to worst. Batgirl 10/10. Mastermen 8.5/10. She Hulk 7/10. Sensation Comics 7/10. Justice League 0/10
//I have a feeling that, as a horror fan, JL will be wildly disappointing
@CloisLover Can she just spend an issue with her hands behind her ears? That would be perfection
@CloisLover And people wonder why I hate N52 Diana...with art like this, who needs enemies!

//I personally miss the Jack Reipan Joker and his cousin, Melvin Reipan. (Hint: Spell his last name backwards) It's from a great comic.
//It's 1 degree F here and I'm enjoying this delicious white chocolate raspberry iced coffee
@AnderWriter $20. They're always 20, sometimes more. I want Anya cuz I like her. I just picked up her solo run in Amazing Fantasy
@AnderWriter Damn! He's the hardest figure to find, $50 or more online for him OUT of package

@AnderWriter I'm gonna check my local Walgreens for her next time I get paid
@AnderWriter Anya Corazon Spider-Girl
@AnderWriter Happy hunting! I'm still looking for the OTHER Spider-Girl from last years TASM2 wave
@AnderWriter Spider-Girl wave hits this week.
@AnderWriter Yeah, they reuse voices constantly in that
@AnderWriter Voices cost money. Might as well use people you have. I presume you mean Ultimate Spider-Man?
@InsaneScribe Not bad. Yeah, I have a pull list as well, but it's thinning some now that She-Hulk and Spider-Verse have ended
@InsaneScribe -comic if you buy a certain number of issues. So I'm mostly lucky
@InsaneScribe Exactly. I'm blessed with a lot of really good shops by me. One does 10 older comics for $10, and takes off the price of a -
@InsaneScribe Quite possibly. But they won't do it because paper costs money. It'll happen when comics go all digital.
@BlindedAuthor @InsaneScribe They don't even love each other, how can they love anyone else?
@InsaneScribe Tell me about it. I've been buying since a time when big name books were $2.50...

Happy President's Day! I've known quite a few, personally. Every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to be precise.

@InsaneScribe About Average for me
//SNL 40 is quite hilarious so far.
@AnderWriter I've tried. I've tried so hard to get into it. It just makes me mad and frustrated.
@AnderWriter Also I actively hate everyone they're saddling me with. Every. Single. One.
@AnderWriter I loved both. But Inquisition's controls just suck so bad I can't even bring myself to play it.
@AnderWriter I'd pay for that. It might actually make me want to play it.
//Why do I bother rooting for the Knicks anymore?

//Such a killer headache. Ugh

@ClassicLois, would you be my Valentine?
@ClassicLois *I bat it aside to write something on a small spiral notepa*
@ClassicLois Yes, your holiness. *I tease*
@ClassicLois Nooooooooothing... *I act suspiciously unsuspicious*
@ClassicLois No reason. None at all.
@ClassicLois Any plans for later, Lois, because I, uh...

Happy Valentine's Day, @ClassicLois.
@HeroineOfSteel Thank you very much, Kara
@ClassicLois 


//Twitter is slowly killing me...
He stole 40 cakes. And that's terrible 
DC: bringing back things we love to destroy them and say "you liked that? TOO F***ING BAD, here buy our new shit."
I've travelled through time before but this is ridiculous.
@CloisLover Because for some reason we are magical.
//I love getting notifications from like a week ago. It's the best.


//My SUPERIOR Avengers display. Only 3 figures to get left! 
@ClassicLois 
@AnderWriter I have -no- clue. Diversity? No POC characters are getting figures but him
//Literally tore him apart and replaced every joint and that's STILL the best pose I can get him to stand in. 
@AnderWriter You know it's bad when JAMIE REYES gets a figure before your favorite character.
-when the MEGO style figure has better articulation than your collectibles line.
-FUNCTIONAL KNEES, ankle hinge AND ankle pivot. You got a problem when you can't pose your action figure. You KNOW you have a problem-
//DC's new figure line NEEDS: Ball hinged head, shoulder articulation, elbow swivel (minimum), an crunch, waist twist, ball jointed legs, -
@AnderWriter The problem to me is EVERYONE gets theirs before Superman in wave 3.
@CloisLover *sobs*

Today, in 1940, I made the jump from the page to the airwaves, when Bud Collyer voiced me in The Adventures of Superman!
@ClassicLois That'll cover it pretty well, I think.
Icons they say. I'm the first superhero, the star child.It's because of me that there are even others at all.  paved the way. Changed things
Wave 3? I don't come out until WAVE 3? BARRY AND HAL GET FIGURES BEFORE I DO? -OF COURSE BRUCE IS WAVE 1! OF COURSE!-
@ClassicLois I didn't mean it as Shakespeare did. I meant as though we are -literally- from different stars. Rao and the Sun
@ClassicLois That came too. It's been long enough that we've been through everything a couple can be through. *chuckling*Star crossed lovers
@ClassicLois -us for who we really are, and they let us be. After all this, we deserve a rest, time for us to be alone together.
@ClassicLois I remember a time when our biggest problems were a giant head and being turned into a chicken. One day, I hope they see -
@ClassicLois -myself to, in costume, the first I shared my secret with...how could it be anyone but you?
@ClassicLois Maxima? Really? The one who was mad at me because I -died-? You were the first person I came back to, the person I revealed-
@ClassicLois Could it ever really be any other way?
@AnderWriter Wow, they musta been dirty cheap then.
@AnderWriter Read ASM 612-614, if you can find them. That's why I want Waid on Spidey.
@AnderWriter I think he's holding on until Secret Wars. He's doing Renew Your Vows. I'm PRAYING he leaves after that and Waid takes over.
@AnderWriter Yep, part of why I'm leaving. He's an awesome guy, drew my favorite recent Spidey arc, buuuuut...his art BLOWS
@AnderWriter 16.1. So probably next month, I think. Or MAYBE the month after that.
@AnderWriter I know, right? And it's written by the legendary Gerry Conway. The man who ended Gwen Stacy before he was 20.
@AnderWriter Spidey and a supporting character called Wraith taking down all crime in the aftermath of Otto killing Kingpin
@AnderWriter NOPE. Next issue is the epilogue to Spider-Verse. Then I'm dumping it until Spiral happens.
@AnderWriter One more issue worth getting ends this month, then just read 16.1- on until the mini is over. It's GERRY CONWAY.
@AnderWriter I never really liked her, TBH. But there's some unwritten rule in the universe that every character I like gets FUCKED.
@AnderWriter -Because This nonsense is something that happened. 
@AnderWriter I dumped that book. Need to save cash. Let me know if Julia's ever in it, but I doubt she will be.-
@AnderWriter He's been OoC since the movies started, and they replaced him with Ultimate/Jr./Coulson. *shudders*I just want the old one back
@AnderWriter He was AWESOME in She-Hulk, but he was just barely in it.
@InsaneScribe It'll be entertaining, that's for sure. XD a Makes me want to dig out Thy Kingdom Come.
@AnderWriter -is cranky cuz he's old. If you've never read it, read Captain America No More. Best Cap story of all time.
@AnderWriter No, that's not him either. 70s Nick Fury, from the dopest of old Marvel books: Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD. And yeah, now Cap -
@InsaneScribe I do too. Do you really blame him for doubting Kon when you remember the last he saw of him, he looked like THAT?
@AnderWriter ...oh god no. I hate that guy. He's such an ass. I'd like to see the REAL Fury return, but I doubt it.
@InsaneScribe It depends. If James Luceno has his way, EVERYTHING old will remain. Which I'm happy about, tbh.
@AnderWriter -4 Thors, Ant Men, the Future Foundation and the REAL F4. Everything else can burn.
@AnderWriter Lol. Secret Wars here we come. I just want the people I like to come out unscathed. The various Spider-Men, She-Hulk, the -
@InsaneScribe C3PX, it looks like. Good to see he survived the EU crash.
@AnderWriter -Tony is dead but alive as a robot (don't ask), Reed went nuts and became a villain and...yeah. Bad things happened.
@AnderWriter Not that I'm aware of he just...stopped existing. He was briefly in the Galactus thing but...yeah. Just gone. Thor's in Limbo,-
@AnderWriter That and Ultimates 3 ended the universe. That's why only Miles, Pete and 1610 Jess still exist. And their supporting cast.
@InsaneScribe Yes. It was a very solid story with a lot if fun references to the really old Marvel Star Wars comics
@AnderWriter I am so sorry for you. So so sorry...
@InsaneScribe I did indeed.
@AnderWriter It's not too late! You can read just the good parts with Spider-Man! You don't need to do this!
@AnderWriter Stop. Just stop right now. It'll save you a lot of pain.


//RIP Barry Allen. Again. See you in 26 years.
//And then Flash died of terrible radiation poisoning because no matter how fast you are, you can't outrun radioactive fallout.

@InsaneScribe New 52 just looks so sad and confused at the long line of Superman
Everything comes from Superman 
@ClassicLois You are most welcome! It was the least I could do
@ClassicLois Oyster crackers work just as well
@ClassicLois Almost done, I think...
//Ooookay. Two ambulances and a fire chief in front of my house...and my neighbors. Well then.
@ClassicLois Hungry?

@AnderWriter Exactly! I'm one of that first generation Superior RPers
@AnderWriter Exactly. And I'm a version of Spidey EVERYONE seems to be doing now, because of spider-verse.
@AnderWriter -Spider-Man account.
@AnderWriter I enjoy both of them very much, they're also fairly easy for me to write, and it's so hard to find people to talk to there -
@AnderWriter Yup, the new/current Thor or 60s Donald Blake Thor 
@AnderWriter I'm trying to decide between the current Thor and 60's Thor
@WriterOfHope I miss the diversity of the old one, and the legacy heroes. But I like a lot of the new stuff like JLU, Batgirl and Supergirl
@WriterOfHope I miss quite a few things, but some of the new stuff is good. I just find the things nobody likes good.
@ClassicLois I think so! *I shake a little old bay seasoning*
@ClassicLois Hey you to you! *I stir the gently simmering soup* A little bit of lobster and crab, today. *I glance sidelong at you*
//This weeks comics: Thor, Justice League United, Darth Vader, Smallville
Down by 4, 354 units since Dec.
Can you please fucking cancel this fucking …
*I hum softly to myself as I stir the bisque I am working on for @ClassicLois, to surprise her*
@AnderWriter She isn't an awful singer, but meh.

@veronicacris @baudyhallee Romita had a hand in it as well. I think we'll get hints, but not the whole thing. It's Batwoman all over again
@AnderWriter No clue. My friend loves her, I'm just sorta bleh
@veronicacris @baudyhallee Absolutely, the changed text boxes (you can see it especially in the Directors Cut issue) hint at it.
@baudyhallee They really do, because they got to the point of screwing over Geoff's plans. I'm cautiously optimistic about the relaunch


@CloisLover I'll stay up with you until I fall asleep at like 2am.
@AnderWriter I'm only on Volume 4, but there's a LOT of stuff going on in it
@AnderWriter I sorta have some misgivings about it, simply because Sandman is VERY complex.
@AnderWriter A character from Sandman. He's Satan.

@HeroineOfSteel //Same as me!
@HeroineOfSteel //I remember how that feels.
@HeroineOfSteel //I was being sarcastic, it makes talking to friends and family and RP partners -REALLY- difficult.
//I just love when I'm not getting notifications for anything, on any account. It's the best.
//Still gotta find my Marvel Select TASM Spidey, and go get my time machine for Marvel Legends Arachne and She-Hulk.

@AnderWriter Yeah, same for me. It's just cool that they're giving an all ladies team a chance.
@AnderWriter Honestly...I don't care. Jubilee and She-Hulk are on the cover. I'll read anything with either in it. XD
@BlindedAuthor In that case, Batman.
@BlindedAuthor On grounds of pants, Batman however. (my brothers response, lol)
@BlindedAuthor Robin, to grow and expand my potential and skill.
@BlindedAuthor Which Robin? If it's Jason or Tim OR Batman, Batman would win. Dick or Batman, Dick.
@BlindedAuthor Skillwise, definitely, but that's because he's older. I'd love to be Nightwing. Not quite Robin anymore, not quite Batman yet
@BlindedAuthor I don't hate him, I just think Robin has less crippling emotional issues, and can do everything Batman can. Especially Dick
@BlindedAuthor Personally? Robin.
@InsaneScribe So many good choices.
@AnderWriter Get her quickly, went to 10 stores and only found ONE.
@InsaneScribe Lets do it!
@AnderWriter Oh. Hell. Yes.
@BlindedAuthor Best Comics Int'l (google, 
@AnderWriter You should get a Carol one too
Divergence, huh? Not sure I like the sound of that. Though there is some promise. Some bright spots.
//Zelda item get noise! 
@ClassicLois Always.
@ClassicLois I know, right? It feels like forever!
//Gotham Academy and Supergirl seem to be out. This is worry some indeed

@InsaneScribe Yes, but not in ways that you would expect, I'm guessing.
//I am -not- happy with the writing choices. Not happy at all.
@InsaneScribe Thats part of the appeal!
@KillYouToDeath You wounded me, but it didn't keep me down. As long as there's a multiverse, there's a Superman. And yes...I would.
@KillYouToDeath -You can join me, once again. We can team up, just like old times.
@KillYouToDeath But I am different than you. You have a point, Clark. But we rise above adversity. We fight for a higher cause. -

@KillYouToDeath I understand you, so very much. But it never ends. For me...it can never end.
@KillYouToDeath No world is perfect, Clark. A perfect world doesn't need a Superman.
@AnderWriter Yup! At least that's what my sources are saying. Not confirmed yet though.
@AnderWriter He's bringing it into Convergence. Rumor has it Jurgens is bringing it out
I -arrested- the worst villains in history. I didn't kill them. There was no neck snapping. I brought them to -justice.-
During World War II, on my earth, I arrested Stalin and Hitler, and brought them to the International Court, for justice.


@AnderWriter I've been there, man. I work mornings because of it, to pay for everything
@AnderWriter Or get another job. XD I spent $100 today, on figure and comics.
@CloisLover I can't wait for the Bizarro arc. It looks fun
@_Prime_Earth_ //Different things for different people!
Everything ends...but I will still be there, at the end of all things.
//Two Mego style figures! Side by side, perfectly in scale, replicas of the old school figures. They're beautiful together.
//Action Comics was chill. Enjoyed that ending. Superman was...disappointing, to say the least.
//WALLOPING WEBSNAPPERS! 
@ClassicLois Eh. Got some other good stuff too though.
@InsaneScribe Got a discount because of Spidey. It was...$90 all told
//Today's Haul! 
@CloisLover *big grin* Did we switch personalities?
@CloisLover Keep believing. Never give up hope.
//SO MANY COMICS TODAY!
So stop -lying- to us. I had more powers than you list. Remember 1998 when I was Blue?
I could move, in my prime, 6.5 QUINTILLION TONS with my bare hands.  Enough to move even the earth.
I had Super Math, could run faster than the Flash, shoot tiny Kryptonians from my hands, rainbows, fire breath...
I'm sorry DC. Super Flare will -NEVER- be an iconic power. And if sales drop even lower, it's gonna get cancelled. So stop playing around.
@ClassicLois Agent Carter was cut off by breaking news, a major train accident north of the city.
@WriterOfHope Yup, it's considered both art and history. Take enough courses in that in college...
@WriterOfHope History is a fascinating thing. My degrees are in Pop Culture history, turn of the century general history and philosophy.
@WriterOfHope Oh Hell yeah. That's my specialty. AP stuff. XD
@WriterOfHope -to get into a classroom, but so far, no luck.
@WriterOfHope Kinda. I do tutoring, consulting and am currently writing a textbook. I'm a social studies expert. I'm trying my hardest-
@WriterOfHope Anything to help! That's what I do best, even if I can't find a full time job.
@WriterOfHope Both. As a teacher...definitely both.
//Nice of them to let me see the last...3 minutes. Fantastic.
@AnderWriter That's a relief
@AnderWriter Anybody important or named? Or just the Redshirt?
@AnderWriter Noooo, not Dum Dum Dugan!
@AnderWriter So what's going on now?
@AnderWriter I'm fine, it happened north of me, but the ice out here is making everything a huge problem.
@AnderWriter Sweet. It looks like I'm totally gonna miss this episode, because somebody tried to outrun a train.
@AnderWriter Tell me what's happening, there was a massive train accident in my area, so the news cut in.
@BlindedAuthor Absolutely!
//Soooooooooooo boooooooooooooooring...
@BlindedAuthor Oh, absolutely. And do it cheaply.
//That effect was simultaneously amazing...and shit.
@baudyhallee Yuuuup. They hate everything that we love. Everything we grew up with. Everything classic.

@SuperheroFeed Icon
@WriterOfHope good times, good times.
@InsaneScribe Of course, he's in charge of their biggest event, so naturally, he gets the most freedom.
@InsaneScribe Exactly. Same with Scott, who had relative freedom, but was forced to make changes.
@InsaneScribe I'm counting the days until convergence, to be honest. I like Geoff too, but if editorial's forcing him to change stuff...
@InsaneScribe Absolutely. A lot of things seem to be late changes
@InsaneScribe Superman and destructive powers have a long history of sucking. For example electric Superman
After all, I've been at it for over 7 decades, and I have something worth fighting for.
Super flare? Seriously, that's what they're calling it. I bet I could still beat that whippersnapper, despite him being in his prime.
@AnderWriter Damn.
//3 INCHES of ice on my car. 3 INCHES!
Today's the Day the Music Died.
@InsaneScribe Oh, it was. The Other is one of the best Spidey stories ever told, and that was JMS.
@InsaneScribe Hmm. Spider-Man, if you can find all of Spider-Verse. New Thor is really good so far. Ant-Man. The Arms of the Octopus trade.
@WriterOfHope I'm an old fan, loved his Spidey and Thor art. I met him and his dad at NYCC they were AWESOME
@InsaneScribe There are a lot of Easter eggs and teasers to it because of that, and he's writing secret wars so...
@AnderWriter More sense than being 34 too. More opportunity to see Bucky as well.
@WriterOfHope They are all good with dynamic art, like Romita, but are more straightforward artists appealing to a mass audience.
@mrjafri I got mine bundled with Batman earth one vol 1 on Amazon for $7 plus shipping.
@InsaneScribe It was aight. Fractions Future Foundation was a great book, the F4 were in it. An underrated series.
@WriterOfHope It was definitely a lot of fun. Some good mythology gags too.
@AnderWriter It definitely is. I'm gonna say "Soviet Supersoldier serum." Makes more sense than the films given timeline.
@mrjafri It's pretty chill, I enjoyed it a lot. Explored a lot of what it meant to be a hero,
@AnderWriter Yup. And we see little Nat. More than meets the eye!
@WriterOfHope Artist? Hmmm... Chris Batista, Rags Morales or D. Eaglesham.
@WriterOfHope Superman fighting a giant evil whale on the moon with a bunch of aliens and Hector Hammond's help.
@mrjafri Parasite is the second one, first one is a new guy with wings and all of Supes powers
//Best Batman stories I can recommend, all from Legends of the Dark Knight: 6-10, 42-43, 50, 180-181
@WriterOfHope Same, I have one arc, the one with the atomic Knights. I recommend that, it was super cool.
@WriterOfHope True. I'm hoping it doesn't last long. I'm really enjoying that series tbh. Even liked Lobdell's action run.
@mrjafri Earth One Vol 1 is a good example.
@AnderWriter And Gorillas. Everything's better with gorillas.
@AnderWriter Gail Simone's run, not anything modern, mind. XD 14-17 is her origin story + fighting Nazis, and 24-25 is about shitty films
...it is from something far more human. His heart." -BATMAN
@AnderWriter If -anything- try Wonder Woman 14-17 and 24-25. They're worth a read just as a comic fan.

He began saving lives, a mysterious figure who would stop a flood or rescue a baby from a burning building. Martha Kent kept a scrapbook

@WriterOfHope Atomic bomb Superman?
"Clark Kent was not always Superman. As a child, he displayed little or no powers. He lived in Smallville, Kansas and had all the problems
@WriterOfHope But then there's DESTROYING a character. Like newest Superman
@mrjafri Because Superman beat Darkseid. By himself, with just his bare hands. No help. It isn't power.
@mrjafri Because, Superman has been around a long time. He's evolved a lot. His weakness is people attacking what he loves. Like Brainiac.
@BlindedAuthor -saved by someone else, and he gets the people he cares about back. It's Knightfall for Superman
@BlindedAuthor -and then he travels into hell to beat General Zod, who breaks his spirit first, THEN they fight, Superman loses until he's-
@BlindedAuthor -In For Tomorrow, Supes loses everyone he cares about, then loses against a bad guy. Then the League. Then he beats Diana-
@BlindedAuthor Nah. Batman wasn't even down when Bane broke him. First Zod did it (Red Sun Armor Zod) and the ENTIRETY of For Tomorrow.-
@BlindedAuthor -And yes. That story exists where Superman is losing. It's called For Tomorrow, and it's all about him losing, constantly.
@BlindedAuthor Superman will never be down, just like Batman will never be down, or Wonder Woman. Nobody likes when the bad guy wins.-
@BlindedAuthor It's not overwhelming power that beats Superman. It's attacking what he cares about most. His heart is his weakness.
@CloisLover Me too!
@WriterOfHope Absolutely. Nothing can keep him down.
@CloisLover Keep up hope. Always, keep hoping.
The fuzzy details are just time distorting my legend.
Disney's Hercules is merely an alternate universe when I was sent to earth and arrived during the days of Athens dominance.

FAV team books
Guess what... Superman was already cool.
@AnderWriter My shop is great with that. I'm gonna go shelf hunting this week, I think. See what I can find.
@AnderWriter 18.99 at my LCS
@AnderWriter Not entirely sure. I haven't seen it yet.
Up, up and away.
@ClassicLois //Yup yup. I saw it, it was very touching and cute. Great cinematography.
@ClassicLois //The Disney Documentary?
"@highway_62: Why I hate modern superhero comics in a single lede/image: 
@AnderWriter I keep finding it at my local Disney Store. That one and Spider-Man
@AnderWriter Exactly. Whereas the DST Falcon, for example, is way better than some of the other Winter Soldier figures
@AnderWriter I tend to get a variety, with my imports TOWERING over my US figures, but some movie ones are cool.
@AnderWriter Maybe I'll get Cap. Not sure though.
@AnderWriter Not yet!
@AnderWriter Diamond Select.
@AnderWriter Or Odin, depending on which ones you get.
@AnderWriter DST might do it
@AnderWriter That is pretty dope, not gonna lie. It reminds me of the old school Thor.
@AnderWriter I wonder if the current Thor will get a figure, even if it's a Marvel Select. She's pretty dope
@AnderWriter Will do!
@AnderWriter I'm waiting for street date, grab em at Target or my LCS for 20. I got  Otto, and am getting Star Lord that way.
@AnderWriter Mayday, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman (3)
@AnderWriter Is there a street date yet?
@AnderWriter I asked for the anniversary edition for Christmas, and got it. Not the worst ever.
@AnderWriter I'm waiting for Carol from that wave. Then I'm getting 3 Spider-Man wave figures. XD
@AnderWriter Some of it is pretty good, but the bad bits are -REALLY- bad.
@AnderWriter Rape, Dr. Light, death if Sue,  Jean Loring, Ralph going crazy. Mind wiping people.
//Gonna go buy Star Lord figure when this damnable storm ends. If it ends. Probably Wednesday.
Human Bomb powers now? Can I get a fast forward to April please? PLEASE?
@CloisLover Even SPAWN understood that. Seriously. Spawn 10.
//It's like I never even shoveled...
3 Clois Valentine's Day gifts, from DC!!
No Fauxmance!!
@CloisLover wait, what? What miracle is this?
@WriterOfHope Oh, absolutely. But I can't see him without immediately thinking of Edward Kenway
@CloisLover Maybe that's what DC really stands for. Dudebro Comics
Hey DC, next time you do a survey of your long time readers? Maybe listen to it, instead of making up your own nonsense.
Why...why does the company break things I like so much?
@WriterOfHope I'm enjoying Flash for a lot of reasons, I'm not liking what they did to my 80s asshole in the show, he's very flanderized
@WriterOfHope I like a grand total of 1. And I like it more than DCs films. Mostly because it maintains a strong sense of fun.
@InsaneScribe Use CG transitions and stock footage.
@InsaneScribe Naaaah. Do it like Manimal.
@WriterOfHope I hope it bombs. DC's just making me madder and madder.
@CloisLover WHY? WHY DOES DC KEEP SCREWING UP THINGS I LIKE? Why can't I be happy with my DickBabs and my Clois?
Happy Groundhog Day! Even more winter is in the forecast,
@CloisLover Wait, what now? They're ruining -another- thing I love?
@ClassicLois *I throw open the window and start to clear off the piles of snow and ice built up upon our windowsills*
@ClassicLois I'll be fine, it's no hurricane. Just some wind, snow and icy rain.
@ClassicLois Want me to heat vision it off of our balcony?
@ClassicLois *I yell in from the kitchen* Another glorious snowy day!
Another beautiful snow day in Metropolis!
@ClassicLois *I call in from the other room* Already on it!
@ClassicLois Faster than a speeding bullet!
@FabledClark He -hates- you?
@ClassicLois Yes. Yes you can.
//Thanks for the triple notifications from over an hour ago. I really appreciate it.
@ClassicLois I'm nowhere -near- as mopey as finger-gloves over there! *shudders at the thought*
@ClassicLois I refuse to go be miserable and mopey. My modern version can go do that for me. *cuddles with you*
@ClassicLois *sighs heavily* Do you still want to cuddle?
Congrats to Brady on the 4th win in his career, and 6th appearance in a super bowl.
Congratulations on the victory to the *mumbles halfheartedly* New England Patriots
@ClassicLois No matter who we root for...I love you. I will love you until the end of time.
@ClassicLois of his 6 Superbowls...he's -never- beaten my favorite team. He just can't win in the big city.
@ClassicLois I'll probably be bitter for about 2 days, then everything will be fine. I will still despise Brady until the end of time. But-
@ClassicLois I'm allowed to be annoyed, I bet Jimmy that the Hawks would win.
@BlindedAuthor Nope. Cuz he can't throw a fully inflated ball.
Have fun holding your balls asshole.
@ClassicLois Not technically.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Now Brady's gonna sit there, holding his balls for 20 seconds.
Pats win it on an interception. Fuck you Brady. Go take your 4th ring and shove it.
@ClassicLois //Pats are winning by 4. Hawks possession, 1st and goal, 34 seconds.

@ClassicLois //It's 24-21. Pats are catching up
@ClassicLois //That's so bogus!
@ClassicLois //Never bet against big blue. *Kisses your cheek*
PUMP IT! Seattle TD! 23-14
Brady stripped! Seattle's got it again, 3 points up!
TOUCHDOWN SEATTLE!
@ClassicLois //Tied. Halftime.
The more you know! *insert picture of Katy Perry flying over the field*
@ClassicLois //NOOO!
CRUNCH TIME! TOUCHDOWN HAWKS!
@AnderWriter Early 2000s JRJR was chill. I met him once, he and his dad signed my special Spider-Man cover.
BUMMER!
@AnderWriter I dig his Thor, Cap and Spidey runs. There was some great art during all that.
@AnderWriter Typically, it's not THAT bad. But it's very...90s...
@AnderWriter Not sure if they're trying to kiss, or fighting.
TOUCHDOWN SEATTLE! YAAAAAAS!
Thank you, Super Wilson!
BOGUS!
//Every time New England scores, I will react the way Super Macho Man would.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
@AnderWriter Pretty sure.
Best commercial so far: Jurassic World
BEAUTIFUL INTERCEPTION! GO HAWKS!
@ClassicLois *I hold it in my teeth* Fanks! Pi' in a banket?
@ElvenBeauty100 Seattle. My preferred division...and it's a bonus that they're going up against a team I love to hate
GAME TIME!
@ClassicLois If you mean he loves his balls, I agree with you.
@ClassicLois I prefer the way of not cheating, thanks.
@ClassicLois I'd rather use a bald eagle.
@HeroineOfSteel @ClassicLois Sounds good to me
@ClassicLois Ready to watch Brady deflate, just like his balls?
@ClassicLois Hello there!

@ClassicLois @HeroineOfSteel I can't forget the little cocktail wieners. *I grin broadly*
@HeroineOfSteel @ClassicLois Wings, blue cheese dip, chips, pretzels, Velveeta cheese dip...
@WriterOfHope So what do you think of the lantern one?
@WriterOfHope 
@WriterOfHope Supergirl is the same way. It's weird. Cyborg looks pretty dope too
@WriterOfHope It's not great looking. He's designed by the guy who did Gundam and he looks like a giant robot would.
@WriterOfHope They do. Superman (bleh), Hawkman, Darkseid, Supergirl, Batman, Cyborg, Lantern...
@WriterOfHope I know, right? It looks AMAZING. 100 bucks ain't bad for an import, either
@WriterOfHope It's what Arthur would look like if he was created in Japan. He was designed by some manga-ka. Don't remember which
//I want it so bad. $100 dollars of awesome! 
@ClassicLois There's a reason Russell Wilson wears blue and can do anything with the ball. It's cause he's the Super Quarterback
It's Superbowl Sunday. Go Hawks.
@CloisLover TWO issues? Goodbye money...
@CloisLover Always. Is this the cover for this month? He always looks like that on his covers. Nobody knows how to give him a good cover
@CloisLover WHAT DID THEY DO TO MY POOR SUPERMAN NOW? D:
@InsaneScribe Good story though. They just don't do great covers for him very often. The exception being Geoff Johns stories.
@BlindedAuthor Atlantis. Superior technology and affinity for the sea creatures. Even the Amazons own Megalodons.

//I love when twitter has a heart attack she you're trying to scroll


@BlindedAuthor I'm not denying that!
@BlindedAuthor There are shades of the really good Palmiotti Conner PeeGee comic in her, but... I think part of it is a "take that" at DC
@_DownToEarth Keep calm and read Gail's Wonder Woman 24-25.
@ClassicLois @FabledMOS //Yes it is. There are...4 trades of that era.
@AndersWriter I can't get into what they did with JLD. Too many characters I like have been screwed over. Deadman, Zatanna and Swampy.
@AndersWriter *hisses like an angry cat* The new her...isn't good. At all. Compared to her Paul Dini solo book...
@AndersWriter They want to use her. And DC wants them to use her. It's not gonna last past this season though.
@AndersWriter Too much New 52 for me. I like OLD SCHOOL Constantine, 70s. I'm afraid of what they're gonna do to my Zat.
@AndersWriter //NOPE! I don't watch anything except Flash and Arrow from DC and Agents of Shield. It's not worth my time or aggravation.
@CowledHeroine //I've been him since Otto was Spidey over a year ago. I used to have a Spider-Man 600-Ends of the Earth Otto a while back.
@AndersWriter Mostly because they didn't care. And because they didn't care, I couldn't care.
@AndersWriter Boo. I simply gave up when they ruined Renee Montoya
@FabledMOS //Keep trawling Tumblr for images. The best advice I can give you.
@CowledHeroine //I have my general Marvel RP account I'm using. @ABetterSpidey. I RP the Superior Spider-Man!
@FabledMOS //Sometimes you gotta know the right people. XD
@FabledMOS //Smallville!
@FabledMOS //Not there. But here, yeah 
//Little known fact, Superman has a social security number: 092-09-6616. The only number granted to a fictional character. Suck it Batman
Saving the day...old school. 
@CowledHeroine //Yes. All of it.
@BlindedAuthor There are a lot of good choices.
@BlindedAuthor The woman from the Prince of Persia movie is my choice. Athletically built, British accent...and she can ACT
@BlindedAuthor She's terrible in Fast, so why the hell would we want to see her in that? Why would we want to see her at all?
@BlindedAuthor Why on earth would they pick her? She's HORRENDOUS.
@BlindedAuthor A literal cardboard cutout would be better than Gal.
@AndersWriter I like it...but personally because I like beards and occasionally sport a goatee
@AndersWriter the evil Superman ally one has a stupid beard. ACTUAL Beard Aquaman is awesome. Pre hook hand badass beard
@AndersWriter It would be 10/10 if it had a beard. The one that has a beard looks stupid
“@AquamanShrine: Happy Birthday Aquaman! 
//Best comics of the week, hands down Thor 4 and Multiversity. Not even Aquaman can touch their greatness.
@BehindTheBat So would a lot of people. There used to be the Silver Age omnibus of Aquaman, dunno if its in print anymore.
@BehindTheBat So many years of awesome comics that people have forgotten, waiting to be discovered
@BehindTheBat Nope! He wasn't an Atlantean for a -long- time, until Crisis, when everything changed (the first time)
@CloisLover @InsaneScribe Batman. Of course!
@InsaneScribe Which Aquaman? His son was, yea
@AndersWriter So it won't break the bank then. Good.
@AndersWriter How many issues so far?
@AndersWriter Three Crises and the 90s do that to you. At least he wasn't Lex, lol.
//When did Maelstrom start? I want to go back and get it all
@AndersWriter It's beautiful, I found it on Comicsalliance. Covers his whole history, but that's the bit I like the most
@CloisLover Such BS. Superboy Prime is so disappointed, he just punched the fabric of reality.
@AndersWriter Check my pics quickly. You'll like the last 3 a lot
@CloisLover hmmm...maybe Earth Prime. The real one, I mean.
@CloisLover Not proper Injustice, the one from the Injustice comic. And they'll use the current gen TV shows as a universe
My friend in a nutshell. 
@CloisLover Pre-Crisis Earth-1,2 and 3, TDKR, Injustice, Flashpoint, TV/Movies
@InsaneScribe Indeed. Old School Earth-3 had some really cool designs
@WriterOfHope The Cosmic Grail is represented by Alan Scott's lantern. They talk about Infinite Crisis on that earth as well
@WriterOfHope Earth-15.
@WriterOfHope Nope. But there was a -very- subtle reference to it
@InsaneScribe Definitely. As is old school Earth-2 and New Earth.
@InsaneScribe 12, 15, 31, 38, and 51 are -very- interesting to me.
@InsaneScribe I have a few theories. TDKR is one of them. Earth 15 has me most intrigued.
@InsaneScribe Of course! Which earths have you most intrigued?
@InsaneScribe I don't know, but he has an amazing design. The goggles make me think of a spider, almost.
@AndersWriter The DeLorean and the ECTO 1 had to be the best, by far.
@InsaneScribe It wasn't that bad. I kinda liked it compared to Court of Owls Freeze. It was more sympathetic, kinda smart-ish
@AndersWriter I got a ton of great stuff that way. Some Batman stuff. Some LEGO movie stuff. A few Marvel sets
@InsaneScribe Oh hell yeah!
@AndersWriter If only I was still their employee... 50% discount. XD
@CloisLover You mean it hasn't subliminally started yet?
@AndersWriter  $200+ presumably.
@WriterOfHope Batfleck: he's the goddamn Batman!
@WriterOfHope ASBAR is worth reading though, one of the funniest comics ever written. It's just -that- stupid.
@AndersWriter FF 1-16. It's the Fraction one, not the Hickman one.
@AndersWriter Kinda. The F4 left on an adventure, and the FF take over as babysitters sorta
@WriterOfHope Yes. It's one of the worst comics ever written. It's not even funny bad like ASBAR, it just blows.
@AndersWriter FF. It ended last year. Medusa is one of the main characters, with Scott Lang and She-Hulk. You'd love it.
@AndersWriter Read Future Foundation. Trust me.
@WriterOfHope She's never read it, she associates it too much with its sequel. Also, it's got a lot of 66 references.that surprises people
@WriterOfHope He just spent the last few centuries fixing the Sun. :) And now he's back. His first act?Resurrect Lois 
@WriterOfHope It depends. As a whole story, ABSOLUTELY. It's a great, complex character story.
@WriterOfHope Absolutely...even though it's kinda canon. Because All-Star Supes is the Solar Superman from DC One Million
@WriterOfHope It makes a lot of sense, I think. And its -definitely- something Grant would do
//I ordered mine today. Getting it in March. It's BEAUTIFUL. 
@AndersWriter Definitely one of them, because of Multiversity, Spidey 2099, Arkham Manor and Gotham Academy
@WriterOfHope -is that it's a multiverse of Multiverses, and that some worlds are -shared- between Multiverses, like Earth-4 and Earth-23
@WriterOfHope TDKR? It's one of the unlisted earths, but it's there.Grant spoke about it in one of the interviews.My theory of Multiversity-
//It all still happened... And it's BEAUTIFUL in it's scope, encompassing -ALL- the history...like it was planned. I &lt;3 you Grant
@WriterOfHope Earth-2, Gaslight, Watchmen, Steampunk, Mashup, Cyberpunk, Generations, Crimson and Crisis are all confirmed, which is nice
@AndersWriter I have about 10 free comic codes from DC. I'm gonna test one out, see if it works on it, despite it being a tad more $
@AndersWriter I'll see what I can do for you. Is it available digitally?
@WriterOfHope If there's one thing we know...there's ALWAYS a Superman. After all, the Multiverse comes from Superman.
@AndersWriter -interested in convergence. It gives you the history and the rules of the universe
@AndersWriter It's a great cover. Actually though, totally worth the $8 price tag,it's essentially required reading for N52 fans and people-
@WriterOfHope -in the vein of historical badass Ben Hornigold. He even uses Hornigold's color motifs!
@WriterOfHope I loved seeing New Frontier and Leatherwings. Leatherwings just confirmed my Headcanon of Supes as a pirate hunter -
@AndersWriter I spent $25 on the Jimenez cover. Every issue has been $10 for me (I get the black and white variant every time(
@SorryNotSorry52 Just you wait, then you'll be stuck in the past, with me, and some future you, who you will hate, will be the "real" Lobo
@SorryNotSorry52 Stop trying to let go of the past. The past makes and shapes the present. And one day...the present is the past.
@SorryNotSorry52 They haven't wanted me for a long time. But I remain, because they can't forget me. I keep coming back
@WriterOfHope *Good
@WriterOfHope I completely agree. Suuuuuuuuch a goof comic!
@SorryNotSorry52 Never underestimate the power of the last Czarnian...or yesterday's Man of Tomorrow
@SorryNotSorry52 The "Main Man" was better than you. Not as disciplined...but more of a wildcard.
@CloisLover I'm just glad they actually included Jimmy in something vaguely Superman related!
@FabledZorEl I bet I could. I defeated and teamed up with his superior version.
Look to the skies. The infinite earths...The skies are full. Infinite possibility. Infinite probability. Infinite diversity



@karlkerschl @beckycloonan @brenden…
Exactly as it should be, when showing my earth. @ClassicLois and I, side by side, inseparable. 
@ClassicLois If anything, I lost weight. I was built like a brick wall back then, gained some definition...
@ClassicLois I stopped running and started flying. Good times
I beat the Flash, in my heyday. When I was the strongest thing in existence.
//Earth One Superman Vol 3? Color me intrigued!
My Bruce was very fond of making sure crime didn't pay. He, like I did, mellowed out over the years. 
@BlindedAuthor That one, I don't remember.
//The glorious, bleeding edge technology I have to work with at work. 
@BlindedAuthor It's a very good book, there's a decently priced trade of it out there. $15-20 ish depending on where you get it
@BlindedAuthor Yes, it was a comic first. It's a miniseries by Darwyn Cooke simply titled New Frontier.


@ComicKodi No, you aren't.

@AndersWriter Nice. I love that series. The Mass Effect Comics are really good too, if you haven't read them
@AndersWriter Superior Spider-Man. Matt Fraction's run on Future Foundation. Spider Island arc of ASM.
@AlienatedSavior The world would have been a very different place. And perhaps Bruce would be more likely to take a day off, now and again
@AlienatedSavior I would prefer to forget the electric powered me from that era, but you were most impressive.
//Looks like no class this week, maybe until Thursday.
//Welp, time to go out there and start digging out, I think.
@CloisLover My favorite!
