Never thought I'd say this, but:
a) I'm going to girls night, &amp;
b) We're watching 50 Shades. 
I'm concerned about section b) of this tweet.
I need all of the Zelda games to take with me to Rwanda for rainy days.
Just finished Eliot's "Silas Marner" (1861). I thought I'd hate it, but it ended up on my "favorite books" shelf. #amianenglishmajornow?
Going to a leggings party tonight. I think this is the girliest thing I've done. What do you even do?
Mandy is hardly a fan of #LOTR and she brags that she's buying Arwen's necklace. Am saaaaaad.
@DrPantaloon Rhubarb wine is best wine. I loooove that stuff.
Loving, hopeful, and optimistic this morning, @albertaNDP @RachelNotley. #abvote2015 #abvote #abpoli #NDP #ndpmajority #ndp2015 #notleycrue
"Spring has arrived." @RachelNotley #abvote2015 #abvote #abpoli #notleycrue
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING. #tearsofjoy #NDP #abvote2015 #abvote #abpoli #notleycrue
@DrPantaloon @evkmack Meeeee toooo. That was the only one of my dreams that didn't come true tonight.
@evkmack I hope you've got your new Prenrice reaction face saved now.
It's hard to do math when you're looking in the mirror. #abvote2015 #abpoli #abvote #NDP #notleycrue
JIM PRENTICE RESIGNED. But wait, he said he accepted responsibility for his actions. I'm confused. #abvote2015 #abvote
@evkmack So is the wavering sadness in his voice.
Birthday present: #notleycrue t shirt. Please.
I think I pulled my wisdom teeth stitches out yelling with joy too much. #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #ndp2015 #abvote2015 #abpoli
@DrPantaloon I love you.
I'm so excited I'm gonna pee. #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #NDP #abvote2015 #abpoli
Lunch invites are far less fun when the only thing you can eat is soup. Stupid wisdom teeth.
@DrPantaloon Well it's apparently quite hard and expensive to find cosmetics in Rwanda, so I'm stockpiling for the year. It adds up!
The list of cosmetics I need to buy to supplement me in Rwanda is going to bankrupt me. :'(
The Tolkien Edit of the Hobbit makes me happy.
Now that I've seen Walter Bishop in #Fringe I can't quite hate Denethor in #LOTR as much.
Tomorrow I get to hang out with my Jon all day. &lt;3
I've done so many sit ups today. I mean, I've had to get off the couch at least ten times.
Wait, "liquid diet" while healing from surgery means "alcohol," right? To wash down the T3's?
I can probably sit through #AgeOfUltron high on T3's right after my wisdom teeth extraction, right?
We finally got my "new" bike running today and it sounds so pretty I almost cried.
@evkmack Whoops, misread :) long day today haha. Congrats!
@evkmack Eugh, how disappointing. Close call!
@evkmack Well, you know how I feel about overseas contracts :) also paleontology.
4.5 years. C'monnnnn, Gordon.
Matching clothes is so hard when you can't understand the "attractive vagrant" look most girls go for these days.
@DrPantaloon summer, too. :(
Life will be so different in Rwanda when I can't endlessly rotate through social media feeds. Also full time teaching. And burning daily.
NO. NO. THIS IS NOT THE END OF FRIENDS ROSS AND RACHEL TAKE THE APARTMENT DO NOT LEAVE YOUR KEYS BEHIND NOOOOOOO.
Just got four travel shots (two in each arm) all at the same time. I'm a trooper and I deserve alcohol ASAP.
My mouth is all puffy from dental work AND I was just told my wisdom teeth are weird looking &amp; need to be extracted by a surgeon soon. :'(
Also, I couldn't pick what penis term to use so thats the one you get. You can thank me now, Twitter.
The real Easter treat was learning my brother broke his wang during unsuccessful shower sex a couple weeks ago. #Easter #Miracles
I wish Ross wasn't the father. #TeamJoey
Ludacris is still making music? I thought he tapered into nothingness after Grade 8.
I regularly &amp; seriously consider having Gordon + I each marry into another couple in Ireland/Scotland so we can live there.
Travis &amp; Brett &amp; Sam are anxiosuky asking about when to come to my grad and they were crazy and sometimes awful but also my heart is happy.
I am kind of ridiculously hurt by these awful wrong number texts.
It happened. Saw not 1 but 3 of my students in public today. Who's that guy with Miss F? JUST A FRIEND should stop "Miss F has a bf" stuff..
I love Hose Cuervo. Tonight.
Get Low is actually the true story of a poor lawyer-ess who couldn't get into a law firm and had to strip to pay student loans.
With enough hose quervo (sp?) I'll win this limbo tournament against all the Latina ladies.
@JacksonVictori hehehe. I'm so pleased with myself. For the tweet and for dealing with the parent.
Meagan encountered ANGRY PARENT in the PARENT TEACHER INTERVIEWS. Meagan used POLITE BITCHY TRUTHS. The ANGRY PARENT used LEAVE QUICKLY.
@evkmack Remind me to send you mine!
Dear children. Learn to fucking type so I dont look like a jackass in front of my principal. You can google "rainbow donuts" easily enough.
If I want to leave the house I have to put on pants &amp; I just CAN'T watch tv anymore &amp; too windy to walk &amp; don't feel like books/games. Eugh.
Looking through my twitpics and once a wrong number said "Meagan" was my sex name. Alluring. Where all dem boys at?
Gordon has been gone for 8 days and in between all I've done is watched seasons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Friends. I'm so, so boring.
Something I'll never fully understand is pink camp.
@DrPantaloon You're so pretty. And cute.
Oh good. Didn't realize my skirt was partially see-through until about five minutes ago. I have a meeting with a parent today.
@VinceRuhu Oh great! One less thing to pack with me in five months! Thanks :)
I hope Rwanda has chai tea.
Nothing more fun than spending 4 hours with a wannabe televangelist from northern Saskatchewan.
I found all of the bobby pins that have ever gone missing in my life. Jackpot. There's like 200.
There are only two reasons that my Twitter notifications actually fill my screen: time spent with either @DrPantaloon or @evkmack, or both.
@evkmack @DrPantaloon It was fun! Thanks for the invite :)
I'm almost 23 and I can't remember a birthday where people bought me shots.
Preferred form of space travel: Ronan's ship. #GotG
I just want my fives to love me enough to give me their perler bead creations like they do for my mentor.
I never thought I'd say this, but I think I need an ereader. Because I can't bring my library to Africa. Help @kobo @AmazonKindle
Just had a successful hair curling episode! Yay, grad picture hair! 
@evkmack Hopefully deadlines aren't looming too close!
@evkmack Whoa, good for you! What incredible places to go!
@evkmack What cities did you apply in?
@evkmack Thanks! If I room with another teacher, the school will pay for all housing and utilities, so I'm all set!
@evkmack I'll be teaching in Rwanda come August, but my end goal is rural teaching, too!
@evkmack WHERE?! WHERE?! YAAAAAAAY!
So many 80s music at our catan party and all I want is drunk dancing with my @DrPantaloon &lt;3
Don't mind Gordon &amp; I, sitting in our dark basement silently crying to ourselves after finishing our binge of all 9 seasons of @NBCTheOffice
Unrelated: I really miss crocheting. I want to make a blanket but can't commit to a yarn!
Useless skill I learned tonight: brushing my teeth and my hair at the same time. #efficiency #synergize #otherbusinesswords
@DrPantaloon An interaction gone wrong with my terrible aunt and that's what changed her mind. Go figure haha!
My mom is only just now realizing she's " too optimistic about people." (except me)
Wardrobe goals: Mindy Lahiri. @MindyProjectFOX
@DrPantaloon Good luck! (Eugh I should do thattt)
I spent over 10 hours making Gordons Valentine's presents.
@LethHistSociety @NikkaYuko They do this dance every year in galt gardens to end their obon festival!
When I get drunk now my teacher voice turns on a lot.
I just spent five minutes carefully peeling a Starlord sticker from a piece of tape because so much love for #GOTG. Also kids. And presents.
My Jon's response to my Rwanda job interview next week. &lt;3 
I sent my Jon a pic of Sean Bean in drag. Weird LOTR pics are so frequent for us that he didn't address it but just told me about his day.

Boromir!?!? 
Noooooooooooooooo…
So among the many cool education things I've got this week, I presented a 1.5 he session today at a conference and NAILED IT. #adulting
@JacksonVictori eeeee! I'm so happy to see we''re Twitter friends!
@DrPantaloon Please do, oh my god haha
I’m not even apologetic about spamming everyone’s twitter feeds with this hashtag. Fundraising to a good cause! #BellLetsTalk
I encourage any and all resources related to developing, maintaining and nurturing mental wellness in classes. #BellLetsTalk
My hope is that by fostering this open dialogue in younger grades, I can build a better support structure in students’ future. #BellLetsTalk
The primary focus of my educational research has been in fostering a classroom community that is supportive. Very exciting. #BellLetsTalk
I am still always asking, “How can I do more to be supportive to those who need it?” Today, and any day, I invite responses. #BellLetsTalk
I now use it in all situations. It’s helpful to know how to be a good active listener. I can support in times of good + bad. #BellLetsTalk
This Christmas break I took a course on Mental Health First Aid. It really helped me learn how to support others. #BellLetsTalk
I can only imagine what others experience. Mental illness is so deeply personal. We all have our own demons.Real perspective. #BellLetsTalk
The more I believed I was making it up, the more I beat myself up for being so self-destructive. It spiralled. #BellLetsTalk
I know that part of the reason that I never talked was because I didn’t think anyone noticed. I thought I was making it up. #BellLetsTalk
The most frightening thing about mental illness is it’s invisible to so many on the outside, but inescapable on the inside. #BellLetsTalk
The toughest thing for me was taking my youngest sister to the hospital this Christmas because she was suicidal. Surreal. #BellLetsTalk
This AM I woke up b/c I had a dream one of my students became an adult and chased me around a church trying to stab me to death. Dear God.
Thankfully, I have the support of a close circle of friends to help. But not everyone knows (or is) so lucky. How can we help? #BellLetsTalk
@DrPantaloon haha I'm the worst!
This has been noticeably with me for the last 8 years. But dealing with it is tough. And scary. I’m still not great at it. #BellLetsTalk
I suffer from deeply entrenched depression. Most days it’s manageable, but there are periods where it’s unbearable. #BellLetsTalk
Even though our society is getting better, and there’s a wealth of support the actual ability to open up is crippling to many. #BellLetsTalk
I have seen so many close friends and family, as well as students young and old struggle with mental issues. #BellLetsTalk
I know personally I struggle with talking about my own issues. Let’s use #BellLetsTalk to open up the conversation. We all need this.
#BellLetsTalk day is today so I’ve scheduled a bunch of tweets ahead of time. Mental Health talk is SO IMPORTANT.
Please tweet out #BellLetsTalk to show your support for a developing and robust conversation about mental wellness and support.
Today I have a friend date with my Jon to watch LOTR and I'm so happy.
@evkmack Sure, that sounds good. :)
@evkmack Thought so. See you at the Penny! :)
But episode 1 Joey. Yes.
My parents never let me watch this show so expect a lot of live tweeting re: Friends.
Well there goes my internship. I just started watching Friends on Netflix.
@evkmack 4:30-5 ish? Tim's, the Penny or Starbucks are the only places open after 5. Or I have plenty of my own tea
@evkmack Hey! When/where works for you tomorrow?!
@evkmack I've got multicolored sharpies and construction paper.
@evkmack Ha! Sounds fun!
@evkmack it's a date!
@evkmack I'm free any evening this week. What works for you?
@DrPantaloon 272. :( I really thought I had more!
Thrift Shop is literally the worst song.
I wish I was brave enough to dye my hair bright-ish colors.
Yesssssss. "@blopt: Tampon commercials create an unrealistic sense of how much fun it is to menstruate."
I am just so inexplicably happy right now. &lt;3
@evkmack @DrPantaloon Visit me. So many teas. So many tea pots.
@evkmack @DrPantaloon Also, I have 40+  kinds of tea AND I'm actually in Lethbridge for my practicum (finally).
@evkmack @DrPantaloon <BROKEN HEART>
Maybe my new phone is looking for WiFi networks the same way dudes are looking for chicks. WiFi, I'll take your password anytime. &lt;3
@evkmack @DrPantaloon I love you guys. So many feels.
@evkmack Pretty sure Gordon has a list of all the foods I don't eat. I'm the worst.
Love: not watching the #AgeofUltron sneak peek on the #GOTG blu-Ray when your lover is out at 3 social engagements.
Still holding out for @benwillbond to find my instagram follow. &lt;3
I woke up to "Concerning Hobbits" this morning so of course everything will go well on my first day.
I keep a gratitude journal in which I write things I'm thankful for each day. There' s always something good.
If you don't know how to seek joy, then spend some time thinking about what it means to you. For me, it's finding things to be thankful for.
If there's anything I learned in 2014, it is that if you seek joy, everything else will fall into place. Very thankful for this lesson.
I think the most important thing we can do for ourselves each year is to promise ourselves to seek joy. Express gratitude, smile at the sun.
I've had three people text me their numbers for my new phone. I have three friends.
Gordon and Charles are having a music off. Best.
Tonight I had to ask one of my loved ones if they were suicidal. This Christmas has been unreal.
@evkmack you might say I'm really picking up what you're laying down haha. (Dorky moment now over.)
@cmtbonifacio I'm not justifying it, just saying. Private schools are ridiculous.
@cmtbonifacio Private schools are not entirely under the umbrella of Alberta Ed, and have the power to determine their curriculum themselves
I'm self conscious about basically everything. My decision to cut my own hair is really not helping. But hairdressers never listen.
This is an adult present that I got from Gordon because I'm an adult. #AdventureTime 
I'm in a grown up nice dress going to my first grown up Christmas party and I know no one. Except Gordon.
Oh good. My Jon is asking if I'm sure I didn't do any drugs. I wish I had a better excuse than "I really, really, really hated it."
Now he's thinking I did it in a crazy depression over the end of the hobbit. He for reals thinks something's wrong.
I told my Jon about the hair situation and he literally asked if I was on drugs. Oh god.
Note: rage-cutting your hair is never a good idea. I could get away with it when my hair was long. :'(
4 months is a lot to plan for 3 subjects. It ain't no overnight thing. Failure to plan means I'll be failed out of the internship.
I'm incredibly irritated my family refuses to acknowledge how much time I need to unit plan so I can teach. Not coming home till it's done.
Well. Duvet fluff everywhere because I'm an idiot. #suzyhomemaker
I should study for my history exam on Monday that I haven't studied for yet but maybe I'll just get day drunk on eggnog and rum instead.
Now was definitely not the best time to rediscover tumblr.
Mathew Baynton in a suit. Dayum.
Thanks for a Very Good Bad Thing @mothermother! #VGBT #VGBTTour 
Looking through past Facebook profile pictures. Verdict: Hotness factor much improved.
I left our bathroom's TP supply empty to get revenge at Gordon for not changing empty rolls, but it backfired. #homealone #sendhelp
In celebration of ending my uni career, I bought myself ... Yarn? I'm definitely not 80 years old.
I haven't been smashed at the Zoo since first year and tomorrow 10:40 AM my uni career ends and maybe I should fix that? #uleth
Dear Shrek Grizz Scooby,

Please stop Christmas-shaming me on my own FB statuses. This is your last chance.

Kthxbye.
I don't have enough fingers to count how any papers I've already written this semester. Starting on the second-last one, 15 pages. #uleth
known for her folk art scenes of #Lethbridge &amp; area #YQL 
Last episode of #Fringe. Walter :(
I haven't heard from my mom in exactly a month. I regret nothing.
Sudden discovery that ... I really love the Beach Boys? #PromiseImNot50
Also I'm so funny. 
I forgot that text message forwards were a thing, but it's a good thing I've been reminded by two separate people in the last two days.
Writing a film studies paper when all I really want to be doing is writing poop jokes on hand-made Christmas cards.
Because who doesn't have extended solo dance parties to Daft Punk?
@DrPantaloon It seriously makes me so angry. Nooooo.
I just applied to present at a teaching conference. Is this adulting?
I have five teapots somehow. Hobby or obsession? #notahoarder
Reasons that I'm in the right relationship: because we definitely looked up fart stories on reddit and cackled a bunch before going to bed.
That last tweet was a hint for a Christmas present. My feet are size 8/8.5 US.
I wish I had a small fortune so I could finally buy a pair of nice boots. I've skipped out on so many outfits because no boots.
There is a website called 
I might've forgotten to mention it before, but I genuinely hate most of my extended family. In case I didn't mention it.
Going to see #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy again tonight. I love it so. #GOTG
I just went on tumblr for the first time in 60 days and I forgot how to tumblr. #firstworldproblems
@evkmack I wish everyone could be as comfortable talking about it as you. I wish I was comfortable with it. Thx for being a voice for many.
@evkmack I really appreciate how much you care about this.
It's a #Kahlua + #hotchocolate kind of night. &lt;3
Also I want to finish all of the Zelda and hopefully then I might have the skills to play easy mode on Shadow of Mordor and AC: Black Flag.
I miss free reading and art and video games and writing and sleep and relaxing and naps and Japanese. #uleth #fifthyear
The # of times I've ugly cried and had panic attacks about my history paper this weekend are too many. 30 hours of research and no words.
I know Christmas is coming when my cousin starts Facebook posting about how CHRISTMAS IS A LIE.
I've damaged my soft pallets eating too many sour patch kids candies. Like an adult.
It's alright to react with excitement when your car gets recalled, right?
@DrPantaloon I did that yesterday. Yaaaaay.
@DrPantaloon Definitely stay away from knitting. I tried to learn it for two hours before giving up haha.
@DrPantaloon Do ittt. It's about a million times easier than knitting. And a lot faster. And you can make way prettier things.
@DrPantaloon It's super easy! I learned in five minutes from one YouTube video.
Also, doesn't comment on learning dorky skill, but encourages more dorkiness. Best. 
Commiserating with IT Warlock on an almost daily basis is probably the top reason this semester has been bearable. &lt;3
I literally have 13 things due in November and another 6 in December. #homework #assignments #uleth
I just saw my first ever #burlesque show and I was not ready for it because I'm a prude. #halloween
IT Warlock disapproves of this week's #HalloweenCostume :( #koala 
I just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars and it's so good but I'm ugly crying a lot. #TFIOS
Goddammit, #TFIOS. #imnotcrying #yourecrying
I wish I was as tired at night as I am in the morning. :(
Instead of free-reading tons, I spent my entire weekend playing #Pokemon. Not bad, but I feel a tad guilty.
The only photo evidence that I was a #Korok for @drpantaloon's #ZeldaHalloween! #Zelda 
I feel like the Korok is under appreciated. Here's a picture of my cute mask. #ZeldaHalloween 
I think Gordon forgot about our anniversary. 4 years.
"I don't want our house to look like a dong." Actual words I just said in ongoing house-building discussions with Gordon.
IT Warlock knows I'm feeling bad so he's coming to my film studies class w/me tom. to snicker at the prof together. I think he's my PJ. &lt;3
Eating a piece of rhubarb pie has temporarily allowed me to forget how awful I feel about my life for a moment. Lacking positivity lately.
My hair is in the in-between stage.  I'm so frustrated I want to shave it off. It won't curl or dry in waves + I can't put it up. Hellllp.
I'm about 20 pages into #TFIOS and somehow already bawling...?!
I think the most mysterious thing in #Fringe is the difference between the subtitles and what's actually said. #LostInTranslation
Fall colors &lt;3 #AutumnLeaves #yql 
I think @DrPantaloon's #wordswithfriends forever winning streak against me is giving me self esteem issues.
Real talk: I can't work on any of my papers right now b/c in debating w/IT Warlock about what the best Middle Earth race is. #lotro
To follow up, sometimes I'm cute and uh. Yes. I can give you cuteness. Come on, all the hot lovers. Total package right here!
Accepting applications for "hot lover on the side" b/c @DrPantaloon + I just can't do the wine thing like we used to :(
@DrPantaloon "Be the change you wish to see in the world." - Ghandi. 

Oh. Shit.  #imafailure
@charles_logie Better yet: Kill the ones that we don't want to help, and help the ones that don't need it. Nailed it?
My brain's so destroyed this semester that when the nice man @GameStop asked for my postal code I literally couldn't recall it. I ALWAYS do!
Recipe for surviving a crummy semester: 2 parts tea, plenty of candles, 5 parts classical music, and frequently admiring autumn colors.
I wish I could demonstrate my transformation from teen into adult just by completing the pokedex. Erm, wait. I'm 22? #Pokemon
The only thing my hardback copy of the Bell Jar has been good for is pressing fall leaves. #autumn
A good girlfriend would wait to share dessert till her boyfriend got out of the bathroom, right?
I wish there was a "Confessions" page for Canadian politicians. #cdnpoli
I haven't been to Makisu sushi in over a year and my heart hurts. #yql
Like, who cancels Thanksgiving? I've been super stressed and a delightful meal was top on my list. Laaaaame.
I've been looking forward to Thanksgiving since beginning of the semester and just found out mom is nixxing it. I can't even.
I think the major question we can all ask ourselves about #Fringe is: is Walter being a little shit, or is he just a tottering old man?
Nothing makes a crappy day more crappy than ending it by going through your closet and seeing what does and doesn't fit. #noniceclothes
@DrPantaloon CUTEST LITTLE CAP. (and scar free chin)
I feel like I should rescind that last tweet.
Vercingetorix, you can take me as your Gaulish whore. #HH
Yes, Netflix, I'm still watching. I'm just too lazy to touch the controls. Please let me wallow in peace!
I have yet to answer an HH trivia question wrong and I find this pleasing.
I'm burnt out and it's only Sept 25. WUT.
So long, Edmonton.
I'm in Edmonton with a bunch of drunk pre-service teachers. Your children are in good hands, I'm sure. For now. Till the new ones come in.
Man, looking through my old art sketchbooks from high school. Once I got over the "everything is random colors" stage, I kind of rocked.
I need all of the comfort because I have finished the #DarkTower series and I'm ugly crying.
IT Warlock has asked me to marathon #LOTR. Preparing to make friendship bracelets now.
What I woke up thinking this morning: I wish rewards points cards could gain monthly interest.
Also, fun fact: I wasted my 1000th tweet on the Crusades. #congratulations #crusades
I couldn't get to sleep tonight, so of course I would be working on a history ass't at this hour about peasants killing Jews for fun.
Halloween costume searching gives me so much anxiety. I can't make things, either. I need a clothes magician.
I already love HH so much it hurts my heart.
Date night with Matthew Baynton? I think yes. Still missing alcohol though.
I have been going since about 9AM and I'm finally done and tomorrow is going to be so busy and maaaaaan. There's no alcohol in the house.
This volunteer position, man. SO MANY EMAILS HOW MANY EMAILS TOO MANY EMAILS. I didn't really want this, but knew too many ppl to back out.
I wouldn't be nearly so distressed about my wardrobe if I could actually find a pair of flat-heeled boots that would fit my ginormous calves
@evkmack @DrPantaloon Are they possibly crafty enough to whip me up a costume? My only success has been a child's owl costume.
Yesterday morning I was so sad about the long day at uni I would have that I actually brought my slippers to walk around as comfort.
Charles just handed me a snowball. Wtf? #yql
I'm just prepping dried herbs (dill, chamomile, and sage) for being spices, but it just really feels like I'm prepping for a drug deal.
I'm really sad that I don't have the insert for my PIN# for my 3DS so I can keep it on Club Nintendo. :(
Oh shit. I just signed up for an Etsy account. Whoooops.
I should probably just spend my afternoon downloading HH YouTube videos, right?
And in case I wasn't convinced this was small-town enough, in walks a girl who I went to school with at Sundre. WUT?
So a lady at the blood donor clinic recognized the Fullerton in my last name and now I'm sorry she came from Bragg Creek. #rowdyrelatives
I can't convince IT Warlock to play drinking games with my during my film studies class, and I am more than a little sad about this.
@DrPantaloon Please let's do this ASAP.
@DrPantaloon I'm wiling to take the risks of carpet burn and other things. I love HH, but Gordon hates it so I'm ashamed to watch it/dance!
@DrPantaloon ha yeaaaaaaahhhh &lt;3
@DrPantaloon I love you and also I want HH dance lessons one day. Make my fifth year the best year.
Old man wearing KISS-inspired boots seemingly unironically? Hmmm okay. 
THIS IS NOT A DRILL IT'S @DrPantaloon's BIRTHDAY. GO BUG HER. HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
I reaaaallly don't like talking with relatives on Facebook. In any format. Just talk to me never, please.
Okay, I'm totally over university I think.
@stephenkingcast I had to put the book down for a day before I could even look at it again. Right in the feels.
I couldn't get Gordon to watch Fringe but were 5 min. in to Agents of SHIELD and I forgot how much of a dork Coulson was and I love it.
@DrPantaloon Saaaaaaame. I haven't loves characters this much in a long time and it hurts. :(
NONONO NOT ANOTHER CHARACTER. STAAAAHHHHP. #RIPJake #darktower
ALERT ALERT THERE HAS BEEN A DEATH IN MY BOOK AND THIS IS NOT OKAY NONONO. #RIPEddie #darktower
Obviously it's fall now because I have to turn my humidifier on. My nose hates fall, but my heart loves it. #nonosemeagan
Love: "I wanted to eat both but I'll give you one."
@DrPantaloon The party could just become an army of Links. Not necessarily bad!
To cheer me up, I practiced winged eyeliner. Weird reaction. But somewhat successful.
@DrPantaloon Please do this.
Yet another friendship was officially ended on me tonight. Feeling very hurt, and very sad. 6th "best friend" to do this to me.
My new Film Studies prof left his twitter handle on the course syllabus he emailed. He seems nerdly and adorable. What do?
So many people I know have made pregnancy announcements this week and I'm really scared there's something in the water in Lethbridge.
Judging by the sounds coming from this house, you couldn't tell that it's a house full of girls. #burps and #farts
I am incredibly unhappy that school starts in exactly a week.
Um. Just popped a cheap floaty whilst in the water in front of the whole beach, so that's how my day is going. #beachlyfe
Departing into the woods w/ the family for a week. If you don't hear from me, I'm in jail for murder. Or shitty cell reception. Or both.
Gordon + his friends picked me up to go clubbing a while ago. I lasted an hour and now I'm home in my PJ's. #CLUBBINGFUCKYEAH #CLUBBINGNOOOO
It's awful but I might be sort of living in fear that someone on my friends list will do the ALS Bucket Challenge &amp; then remember I exist.
I should be done the complete Dark Tower by next week. Just a heads up for all you anonymous gift-givers I presume are out there.
Someone please buy me the Harry Potter books w/ the covers I want b/c if I can get the Dark Tower out of my way this quick, HP will be easy.
Google: How to fix slutty, underaged, homewrecking sister? Please get to me ASAP k thx.
Um. 6PM naps have happened all too regularly this summer and they really need to stop. School in exactly two weeks. Classes at 6PM.
@UofLBookstore Any chance ISBN's could be listed on TextFinder in the future? Not even sure some of these titles are real.
Stephen King, I love you. 
This trip is fun, but the persistence of varying shades of brown + yellow has assured me I don't want to live on the prairies.
It's Corner Gas! Nice little piece of Canadiana to visit this afternoon. :) 
Victory! #roughriders #ridernation #regina #saskatchewan 
Touchdown right down front. Sweet.
(Confession: I don't know how football works.)
Let's go Riders! If you're watching on tv I'm the one in green :) #regina #saskatchewan #roughriders 
In the same way that there is a Supernatural reaction GIF for everything, Charles has airplane facts that relate to everything.
I hate Saskatchewan.
Off to Regina with Gordon, Charles and Almina. #logiesonroute
Is it too early to Netflix? Should I do something more productive with my morning?
Okay, Mother Nature, let's play a game. It's called, "don't wake me up at 4AM and drag me through hell". It's a pleasant game.
@DrPantaloon This sounds delicious and I want 5 of them.
Is it too late to try and sleep, or should I just stay up and watch the sunrise? #countingsheep
@evkmack That YOU'RE awesome!
@charles_logie Glad to see you know what's good for you.
Talk about popular. #Facebook 
#WeAreGroot more like let me bawl my eyes out at such a profound destruction of my soul. Sidenote: I want a Groot.
Gordon: I couldn't take you on the trip b/c I had to pack stuff. Me: We went to the US last year, remember? Gordon: ...
IT Warlock made me a GIF of Gandalf nodding happily at me and sent it over iMessage. Am so happy. Tragedy: iPhone won't let me save it. :(
Things I love to do: sing. Things I can't do: sing. Actually, I have no talents. Except being a giant, uncoordinated, introverted dork.
It's awful but the damaged politics between autobots compromises me more emotionally than 3 seasons of Veronica Mars.
UPDATE ON MOMS FISH: Gordon didn't die, but her Slytherin fish did.
Right, well, I find the retrospectively awful special effects in this show entirely endearing. &lt;3
Ok, I picked Doctor Who and I shouldn't have started this late at night by myself because scary mannequins.
I've got Doctor Who and Horrible Histories on my watch list. I'm really torn about which to start. I don't have enough summer!
Watched 3 seasons of a show in 3 days. Now, on to Doctor Who, which has been on my to-watch list for far too long.
Mom only texts about 3 things: 1) weather; 2) family drama; or 3) action in her aquarium. Today her unlikely goldfish, Gordon, might die.
Also, twitter: I have a cat. I think that's my first ever tweet about him.
Charlie is sitting on me licking himself and I haven't showered since Wednesday. We're both deplorable creatures, him less so.
I just love Christmas episodes of tv shows so much.
I have the most adorable Japanese stationary sets that I've hoarded for years with cute little envelopes. I want to mail them off so badly!
In search of: one adorable couple to love me like Morgan and Bryan love their PJ!
Sidenote: I am the lamest when it comes to home alone. All I've done this week is watch netflix. That's it. For 4 days, all waking hours.
#LittleBigPlanet3 available for pre-order &lt;3
@DrPantaloon Oh my god. It's so far away. They're just bein bitches. I'm so angry about this!
I have been having a serious case of sad Meagan all summer and all year and all blah and it sucks and I just want hugs and good things.
Because standstill traffic on Stoney Yrail in #ycc 
I can count on one hand the # of close friends I have. This fact makes me sad beyond expression quite regularly. Don't know how to friend.
Home alone in Lethbridge this week since Gordon is abandoning me to go motorcycling. I know I shouldn't, but I'm feeling resentment. Stupid.
@DrPantaloon Being a grown-up is the worst.
Made it almost the whole weekend without some kind of drama. This has got to be some kind of record.
IT Warlock Friend is not my friend anymore. 
Also it's entirely responsible for my continued hoarding of all my stuffed animals. So much guilt.
Pretty sad they erased Buzz Lightyear's character.
Watching Toy Story 3 for the first time. So many feels and nostalgia.
After coming so far in the Dark Tower series, I reeeeaaaallly wish I could become a gunslinger myself.
There are few things more terrifying than being women from a nap by a child's guttural scream.
@DrPantaloon @evkmack :(
@DrPantaloon @evkmack Woooo! I'll pick out some tasty teas from my stash, just in case!
@DrPantaloon @evkmack I'm available after five!
@evkmack @DrPantaloon Yes to both nights!
At least from this experience I'll see the warning signs so I know when to kill my spawn.
I think one of my biggest regrets in life is not being able to choose my family. #familydrama
@DrPantaloon All of my dresses are crumpled in the closet b/c of the same problem w/Gordon. If you're successful let me know how you did it!
My eyebrows depress me so much. They grow wild, crazy, and totally uneven (in patches). They're unmanageable. Craiiiii.
It will be a lifelong struggle for me to actually get my eyeliner anywhere remotely near my eyelashes. #makeup #girling
I didn't mean that. Just raging, because I hated that boss. Pretending I was a fairy in the woods was great, though! #zelda #zeldadungeon
Makar: "oh, whoops, I shouldn't be here hahahaha lololo". Yeah, fuck you, you little bastard. #forbiddenforest #zelda
So fucking done with you, Kalle Demos. #Zelda
Of all the origin stories, I like "married couple fighting" the best.
Reading the #silmarillion has made me not so scared of really dipping my feet into the genre of #fantasy, and I'm only 40 pages in.
Blisters are so weird. Just your body saying, "as a token of appreciation for treating me bad, here is a painful skin flap for you." Thanks.
@DrPantaloon That's sad, because I usually end up liking the things you show me!
@DrPantaloon Absolutely not! I'm sorry I made you feel that way :(
The amount of time I've spent on tumblr has made me have so many celebrity crushes that I can't even keep track of them anymore.
I literally shit in a bush today. Mind you, the hike was 20+ km. #waterton #alberta #poop
Wooooooo #Waterton, Take #3!! I'm so happy to have gone here so much this summer. Doing the Carthew-Alderson trail!
@DrPantaloon The fun stuff always happens after I'm gone!
FYI: #poopinstats 
Skills I wish I had: Photoshop. For art things.
We've been watching #OITNB for a season and a half and I still can't decide if I like it. Characters are sometimes loveable. Or awful.
Zelda has ruined and perfected my life.
I literally spent today in old pajamas, never leaving my pile of cushions in front of the TV, eating junk food + playing it.
I have only been playing #Zelda for two days now, but I love it SO MUCH. How many hours of Zelda? SO MANY.
But seriously though I haven't done any artsy stuff in two years because I just feel I don't have the skills. Finally feeling inspired! #art
I threw a (probably) subpar piece of #silmarillion fanart up on tumblr and it's getting so much love. Feeling confident about my art.
@DrPantaloon :( noooooo
@DrPantaloon BESTEST.
D'AWWWWWE KOROKS!!!!!! #Zelda
Link you so fierce. #Zelda
I know those are strange side effects of gaming, but it's always been the case, even with hand-held consoles and side-scrolling games.
I usually don't marathon video games b/c it makes me hungry/motion-sick, but I spent my entire afternoon playing #Zelda #WindWaker. Great :)
Mr. Hutterite offered his opinion on Stephen King books. Mr. Hutterite can eat it. #officefun #yql
Pretty sure I'm being ogled in this office by young Hutterite boys. Worse things have happened? #yql
How many technology? So many. #technology 
Having only ever played on a GameCube once or twice, I can't tell you how excited I am to play #windwaker today. #Zelda
This is why Gordon and I can never have nice things. #facebook 
Rainy day in #yql. Looking forward to cozy blankets, tea, Wizard and Glass, + possibly some #Zelda.
Mom's absolutely shit communication skills strike again. I'm so tired of this crap, and somehow feeling quite a bit let down.
I guess I'm not going to BC tomorrow? Mom failed to tell me that when she booked the 24-30, it was in August that she booked it.
@DrPantaloon You guys are just so adorable! I've gotta find a PJ!
If everyone loved someone as much as @DrPantaloon and Bryan love PJ, the world would be great. I ship that so hard.
I have been feeling just so obnoxious today. Everything in caps lock. #meaniepants
WHOA CLIFFHANGER ENDING MUCH TO DARK TOWER #3 GOOD THING I HAVE #4 RIGHT HERE LOLOLOLOLOL. #bookies
Three new pairs of glasses &lt;3
Nice one. #popsicle #humor #jokes 
Basically, I've had four perfect weekends I a row. I'm so thankful to everyone involved. Next weekend: cabin life in Jaffrey, BC. Stoked.
I had a hangover by 3PM today, so I think I did river rafting right. #rafting #riverfun
In case I die, watch for me floating around near Cardston. We're rafting with a bunch of hooligans today.
It's taken two summers but I think I've finally got the ladies at the Buddhist Temple to like me. #yql #bonodori
@cmtbonifacio Except you, lazy bones.
Just started the #Silmarillion read-along with an online community. Love nerding out with a bunch of Tolkien lovers all over the world! :)
I wish I had the money for all the #etsy jewelry I want. :'(
I had such a productive day today. So looking forward to tomorrow. So many ridiculous shenanigans will ensue. #summer #yql
Started out morning out with a nice soak in the hot springs. Now 500+ km till we get home.
WHY did we think it was a good idea to go to a pizzeria immediately before visiting the hot springs?
"It's like we're high-fiving with our faces!" An accurate description of how Gordon and I kiss. #techniques
We found statues that looked like they were made of poop depicting Stations of the Cross. We did nefarious things. I grabbed Jesus' junk.
Rested, showered, fed. Today touring the Radium townsite, hitting up Fairmont Hot Springs &amp; its townsite, nice dinner + wine &amp; cards.
Had an awesome ride out (despite starting late). Lots of pictures. Spent the evening in the hot springs. Now, red wine + card games.
Man, I want to be part of the #DoctorWho fandom so bad, because every gifset I see makes me happy, but there's so much of it to catch up on!
I know i can't expect to be perfect in 2 weeks, but this whole failure to style short hair thing is really pissing me off. #GirlProblems
Gordon &amp; I are going on a hot lover's retreat this weekend to Fairmont &amp; Radium Hot Springs. We're staying in cute little cabins! #travelab
I love IT Warlock &lt;3 I think we thrive off of horrible #autocorrect jokes at each other's expense. 
Whelp, no attention to late night confessions, better drown my sorrows in some creepy video games. #limbo
Sad, self-pitying monologue over. I'm so sorry.
I intend to be unapologetically me. I'll continue to believe in the inviolable bond of strong friendships. Here's hoping someone hears this
Some might think this series of tweets is sad &amp; pathetic, but I'm just trying to meet what is a very basic human need. We all deserve love.
Above and beyond the 2 people I have, I'd like to find others to share in the sort of healthy, balanced friendships that many people enjoy.
I feel like things often become one-sided, and I often can't reach out to the other party, for one reason or another. Often they don't care.
At this point I'm so easily discouraged. It's easier to stay home than to take the risk of trying again. It's easier to be quiet than speak.
I just want to find some people to count on. To take the pressure off the 2. To feel healthy. To stop being a hermit.
I'm just too scared. I don't know if this monologue is a cry for help or not. At the very least it's to offer a peek at my perspective.
But I would hope (and stupidly always hold out hope) that lengthy friendships would meet this mark. That I could open up. I could cry again.
So all my past friendships have never shared this loyalty &amp; commitment. Maybe I expect too much. Even if I do, I don't vocalize it.
I find role models in everyone I meet. I want to hold them up and support them. I'm devoted to the friendship as a powerful relationship.
My commitment to my friends, strong links or no, is of a strength I can't begin to describe. I want the very best for each. I admire so much
B/c all I've just described rattles in my brain in the quiet, or when I read a book, or when I watch tv. No small pleasure (if that) is free
When this inevitably fails, I get more discouraged. For the past 2 years, it's convinced me to hardly leave. And lonely I sit, in agony.
If I do go out, I'm so anxious to endear those around me &amp; not come off too strong. I get hopeful a small link might become meaningful.
The catch: my inability to articulate + fear of trust convince me it would be stupid to even bother. Back home I go, feeling even worse.
All of those feelings swirl around my head the moment I leave my house. Suddenly there's pressure to make meaningful connections w/ others.
I've felt incredibly, heart-wrenchingly lonely, guilty, ashamed &amp; depressed at what I harbor &amp; shoulder on my own. Too scared to reach out.
And even though I love these 2 people dearly, I wouldn't even know how to articulate stuff b/c I've been living inside my head so long.
Consequently, I've been increasingly hesitant to share and trust. There are secrets and feelings I have that have never left my heart.
Almost every attempt has been devastatingly unsuccessful. Any confidantes I had growing up left me behind in their dust.
I have tried so hard to cultivate friendships that I can count on, because I really, truly need relationships. Every human does.
I currently have 2 people I can confide in. While I value them so, so much, it's incredibly unhealthy &amp; unfair to depend solely on them
Caution: a slough of venting/personal tweets incoming. Need an outlet.
I am so fucking tired of the FIFA cup.
The sign of true friendship is being able to text in caps at each other &amp; not be offended. IT Warlock + I have just reached that milestone.
While we’re on the topic, I’m positive half my tweets are #lotr related. The rest are associated w/ drunken shenanigans w/ @DrPantaloon.
Also, he fangirled with me over Tom Bombadil, so he’s perf. #lotr #fellowship #hobbits #middleearth
My IT Warlock friend and I spent all day talking about having Gandalf as a grandpa. I’m glad warlock gets me. #lotr #gandalf
I'm a big kid now! #honda #cbr #600 #motorcycle #bumblebee 
The unfortunate &amp; inevitable consequence of experimenting w/my hair/makeup. #kawaii #anime… 
If you don’t want to fangirl with me over the things I love, then shut yo dirty mouth, son!
Among the things most underused on my phone are #emoticons. Here’s a fine selection. <SPOUTING WHALE><KOALA><HATCHING CHICK><SUNFLOWER><PILE OF POO><WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><OK HAND SIGN><PIG NOSE><HONEYBEE><WATER WAVE><FLOPPY DISK><TOILET><ALIEN MONSTER><VIDEO GAME><RICE BALL><BARBER POLE><RESTROOM><NO ONE UNDER EIGHTEEN SYMBOL><CHART WITH UPWARDS TREND AND YEN SIGN> #3AMtweets
Of all the lyrics to be running through my head at 3AM, “play that funky music, white boy” is not on the top of my list. #earworms
Goals for today: learn how to take a #glamorous #selfie, get crafty w/ #WreckThisJournal &amp; have an 80s dance party in my basement.
@cmtbonifacio Thank you! :)
I cut my hair only two hours ago, and I’ve managed to hit myself with my brush about ten times. #transitionproblems
So thankful for everyone who made my whole weekend awesome. I loved everything about it.
I slept until 11:30 this morning because Gordon and I stayed up till 3AM using a $10 000 thermal camera to take pictures of our junk.
@evkmack This kid!
I suppose now that I’ve made that last tweet I’ll now get followed by a bunch of creeper penis enlargement spammer accounts or something.
Condom warning? Condom warming? Who knows?! #LethbridgeHeraldBlunders 
I just tried to order Hawaiian peppers on my Jaime sandwich. Is this a thing? I meant pineapples.
29 pages. 9832 words. Just gotta hand-deliver it, and then it's all over and I can cry and eat buckets of ice cream and sleep.
Still working on paper. Am tired. Want to cry. Everything is terrible. Blech. Due in three hours.
Thanks @cjocfm for getting me through an all-nighter for this ridiculous final paper! #uleth #summerclasses2014
I started this paper back up again @ 2:30. It's 1AM. There's no end in sight. Wish I would've been prepared for this. #miscommunications
@DrPantaloon It hasn't been quite that long for me, but long enough. It's exhausting. I guess we can  just be miserable sops together.
Thankful that Gordon brings me coffee to help get thru this paper. Discovering it's only half-done the night before it's due isn't ideal.
@DrPantaloon Blah, I've been asking myself the same questions. :(
Now accepting slushy summer drinks full of alcohol. Feel like a train hit me this weekend.
My love for mason jars knows no bounds. You might say its uncontainable. Hahaha! #masonjars
I think my dad is a #ValueVillage junkie.
Sigh. I walk into Chinese buffets with so much optimism and leave with so much shame and regret.
I have never been satisfied after coming out of a movie with Tom Cruise in it.
I need more than 4 sites to visit when I'm trying to avoid doing work. The turnaround time from "start slacking" to "end" is too small.
Someone just went through my Pinterest and liked 23 of my pins. I have a sneaking suspicion it’s one of my grade sevens from PS2. #groupies?
One thing I love about my friends is how vocal they are about what they love. I could learn some lessons and join in on the conversation.
Now that I think about it, Prof. Grumpy Martin Freeman also sort of looks like Hawkeye. Still a shithead though. #firehim
I have come to decide that you don’t need to show appreciation for your daddy if he’s not that great. #HappyUnfathersDay
Had a nice night watching Spirited Away out at Nikka Yukko. Too bad I didn’t get to cuddle with my hot lover. Maybe next time, @DrPantaloon?
Sooooo #TheWinterSoldier was awesome.
L: Me without motorcycle license. R: Me with a motorcycle license - I passed my road test! #motomeagan 
I never use the word “ship” but I would definitely use it for Finn and Jake. &lt;3 #AdventureTime
Fuck you, arbitrary “curb lane”. Because of you, I have about 15 things to do to make a proper right turn as per the test requirements.
The most fucking arbitrary thing about doing this upcoming motorcycle road test is all the bullshit that goes into a right turn.
I think my skin is getting sunburn resistant!
Turns out it’s really hard to build a playground. On the plus side, met lots of great people doing good today at Westminster School! #yql
@evkmack Alrighty! I’ll be there after class!
@evkmack perhaps you missed my last tweet, but where is this at? I have class till noon, but I can be there after.
Pretty pissed that Grumpy Martin Freeman’s class is likely to be the first grade below an A on my transcript in 3 years.
@evkmack So I can't come help with your playground every day of the week, but for now I can confirm Tuesday after class. Which school is it?
@DrPantaloon I can only think of a few times when I haven’t done this. Haha!
I went flying over #yql this morning, so of course I took an #airplaneselfie! Don't worry, I was only… 
Gordon just called me “Mom”. I am more than a little uncomfortable with this.
Gonna be spending the next hour or so of my morning flying over Lethbridge. I’m excited! #yql
I have been putting off bra shopping for literally two years. Finally going out to do it. No time like the present.
I’ve got no work done this afternoon b/c my IT Warlock friend and I have gotten up to all manners of ridiculousness. 
@evkmack I can assist in the afternoons of Tuesday-Thursday most likely! I’ll get back to you for sure!
@evkmack When is that? Do you still require assistance?
@evkmack Hello! :)
Finn + Jake 4eva &lt;3 #AdventureTime
I have never been to a bachelorette party. Can more of my friends get married, please?
A Logie Moot is about to happen for my birthday. I keep thinking of phrases like “Logies, assemble!” or “Logies, roll out!”.
My own professor just called me out for being a #ginger. :(
The “Safety Dance” just came on in my classroom, and no one but me seems to now what it is. C’mon people. #wecandance #safetydance
@DrPantaloon AND THANK YOU HERE TOO! &lt;3
If anyone asks what the proudest moment in my 22 years has been, it's probably this. I'm still just as… 
22 years ago I looked like this. There have been marginal improvements ever since! #tbt #lizard 
Turns out it was never locked down, and no one thought I was funny. Help @twitter.
Ever since I got into Ed last year I thought this account was locked down and I was sad b/c I wouldn’t get any new followers.
I’m confused about what the PRETEND @google is. 
Grumpy Martin Freeman cannot differentiate between the Marvel and DC universes am saaaaaad.
Just started #AdventureTime! &lt;3
I swear to god that 1/3 of the replies I get to my tweets are spam/ads. Proof: 
Reeeeaaaallllyy hurt my back yesterday, so if someone wants to give me a free back massage, I would not say no. :(
So the phrase “a sperm concern” is actually a thing that is in my PoliSci notes now. #drstrangelove
On the plus side, I spent the whole afternoon with “Concerning Hobbits” in my head as I played in the garden. #goodtilledearth #hobbits
Things I regret about being a #ginger: there’s no such thing as a base tan, but there is such a thing as a base #sunburn.
One really good reason not to have children is that car seats are THE WORST CONTRAPTION IN THE WORLD.
@DrPantaloon You're the best and I love you!
Been saving this nugget for a while. This came from a white Canadian prof. Maybe he should stop "playing" classroom. 
There are few smells in this world that are worse than leftover “eau de campfire”.
The last thing I want to be doing today is writing a paper on a 40 year old movie that's three hours long. #thanksextragrumpymartinfreeman
The worst kinds of people are the ones who don’t replace the toilet paper roll when they use it up.
@DrPantaloon &lt;3 I love you too!
Just did the chicken dance with four year olds. Am drunk. I’ve had more tequila shots this evening than in my life.
@evkmack Sounds accurate! :P
If that line doesn’t make you excited to start this series, you’re silly. Sets the tone for everything King was going for w/Dark Tower.
B/c stupid, I’ve been putting off the #DarkTower series for ages. “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”
@evkmack Haha, sure thing! :) Wanna say yes to this link? 
@evkmack You must be a time mgmt guru! Also, you’re so open &amp; sincere so lots of positive relationships develop. Lots to learn from you!
@evkmack I’m inspired by your ability to say yes to anything: work, volunteering, teaching &amp; friends! Teach me how to human.
I have 28 different kinds of #tea. Tea party, anyone?
I admire almost every one of my friends so much more than myself. So much to learn about living life from them. #appreciations
Obligatory Mother’s Day thing blergh blergh blergh barf.
If “Come On, Eileen” doesn’t make you want to start dancing right away, you literally have no soul. #solodanceparty #tooralooratooraloorayay
Whelp, I got a #ginger suntan today. And by that I mean several freckles and a sunburn. #yqlsummer
Sitting in the backyard reading, listening to #cjoc and taking in the sun &lt;3 #yql
Pretty pleased that my PoliSci prof looks a lot like Martin Freeman. #hobbit
To do list: 20 million things. Things accomplished today: French toast and grilled cheese. They weren’t on the list.
@DrPantaloon awwwwe. I’m sorry your morning was so crummy,
I can tell summer is here because I was outside for only an hour yesterday and now my shoulders are red. #yql #summer
@DrPantaloon And it’s longer than your last name, so there’s that, too. What a poop!
It’s been a productive day. I started reading at 2, and now I’m starting my third novel of the day. #bookworm
Blech. Spending evening with my face above a humidifier because awful nose. Also bad movies.
Please RT &amp; share with your followers. Again, my donation page is at 
I’m chopping my ponytail for cancer &amp; looking to raise $. Pls donate at

@min2xb Ha! Sorry for confusion! I'm just all on my lonesome out here, so it's been interesting adapting. Nothing bad!
I think that PS2 finally broke me. Good thing there’s only a week left. 
American Hustle is literally the biggest fucking piece of shit. Thx David O’Russell for ruining what was supposed to be a relaxing evening.
The amount of selfies the girls in my religion class have taken within the last 20 min. has to be sacrilegious. Tired of #selfiesfordayyyz
I have to say, my single life in Medicine Hat is pretty comfy. #livinclassy
@DrPantaloon #finalsemestergoals
@DrPantaloon I actually only have two shirts I found out this morning! I’m no good!
@charles_logie brought me this all the way from #Antarctica! #southpole 
I just tried to shove a whole muffin top in my mouth, just to see if I could. Because adult. And junior high teaching. #icandoit
@DrPantaloon Meeeeeee tooooooo. Blech.
@charles_logie Very happy to see this! I’ll let Almina know tomorrow!
Slept through #canada’s #hockey game in #sochi. #worthit
Holy crap. I just discovered the 0 level of the PE building. Scary.
I may or may not have just waltzed around the basement with a stuffed animal. This week has been crazy. And so will the next seven. Blergh.
@charles_logie This is so cool! Should send that in to the riders!
@evkmack Really sorry to hear that.
I do not understand people who save their word documents at 148%. Please don't.
@DrPantaloon Wha?
It's a great feeling to head into the weekend with a veiled threat from one of my profs. #playthegame
@DrPantaloon Awwwww, no! Good thing yours grows out fast! Just reaffirms my refusal to go get another haircut. #twoyearsandcounting
@Saoirse_Faith No problem! I hope you enjoy twitter!
I am having a leg hair growing contest with myself. And I am so winning.
I have had it with this week. First, car bullshit. Second, prof issues. Third, my computer has crashed. I'm so done. And it's only Tuesday.
Gordon bought me this #beluga a few months ago. I think it's become a practice baby. So far we're not bad parents! 
I've spent 6 hrs w/ my EdPsych textbook today &amp; the end is not yet in sight. I'm convinced I've got a mild case of OCD. Or autism.
All of my evenings ever consist of doing homework. Or other work. God.
@DrPantaloon I left my good sweatpants at home. :(
#BellLetsTalk for those so uncomfortable with the stigma attached to disabilities that they are scared into silence.
The fact that #relish is just mashed up #pickles is still incredibly amazing to me. I still need to have both for my burger to be complete.
Still waiting for a good #selfie day.
@DrPantaloon Everything good about the world died in that sentence.
@DrPantaloon Wow haha, the internet heard me. Look what just popped up. Problem solved! 
@DrPantaloon I'm still waiting for you to become internet famous. Also, you have more than 4x my followers. I just checked haha.
Gordon is playing #ConcerningHobbits on piano beside me and I'm happy and craaaaaaiiiiii. #lotr
I follow a bunch of funny people on twitter, but I think the real reason I'm on here is to see @drpantaloon's witty comments.
Also, I just hammered out a 1000 word, coherent, scholarly paper on a #reading I never completed in under two hours. #whodaboss #unilife
Things I like: reading. Things I don't like: $110 textbooks THAT AREN'T EVEN BOUND. #uniblues #notevenacoursepack
@min2xb Yaaaaay!
I've already got the textbook reading blues. #uleth
I thought the era of long-winded text message forwards was gone, but for the first time in about 5 years, I've just received one.
I love you, #Costco. I think I can safely stay away from buying feminine products for at least two years.
#LOTR are over. SO MANY CRAI. LIKE ALWAYS.
Turns out that Sauron's doorman could learn a lot from the elderly greeters at Walmart. #LOTR #mordor
"So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion." #finally #LOTR
I get such a big lady boner for Cate Blanchett when I see her in #LOTR. She is literally my BIGGEST lady crush.
#Shelob's cave ofuck. #LOTR
When Sam and Frodo break up :'(
Worst scene in the whole #LOTR trilogy: watching #Denethor eat. It makes my guts shrivel up.
I really do love watching the montage of the beacons being lit from Minas Tirith. What a shit job, though. #LOTR
Pfffffft. Legolas drinking.
Worse, what if it's become some kind of sexual fetish between them? Or she just gets tired of his coughing in the night. #gollum
I wonder if Andy Serkis's wife is secretly scared of him and the possibility she may be so possessively coveted by him. #myprecious
And now, on to Return of the King. #poordeagol #LOTR
It brings me such joy that Gimli and Legolas keep score. #LOTR
Damnit, Theoden, just take a piece of fucking advice. Blergh. #LOTR #twotowers
If you don't want you some #Aragorn tail, I don't know what's wrong with you. #LOTR #sorryarwen
Also I wonder what Peter Jackson's kids look like after being so cute in the #fellowship. They're probably total hotties now. And underage.
How are bodies so well preserved in the Dead Marshes after 3000 years? #lifesbigquestions #twotowers #LOTR
I wish Ents were real with all my heart. #ents #LOTR #twotowers
Green tea + shortbread + The Two Towers <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<YELLOW HEART><GREEN HEART><BLUE HEART><PURPLE HEART> #LOTR
The formation of the #fellowship always brings me to tears. #LOTR
But seriously though, #saruman is such a little bitch. #LOTR
My one regret with #LOTR in the #fellowship is that we never got to meet Tom Bombadil. I wanted to hear his songs.
I wonder how many steps away from home Samwise ultimately counted. Does the internet know? #LOTR
#LOTR day for me!
Tea + Where the Wild Things Are = cozy cheer-up night. &lt;3
Kamakwie: Finding Peace, Love, &amp; Injustice in Sierra Leone by Kathleen Martin 
Just saw Hunger Games Catching Fire and even though I read the book I think I peed myself four times.
I rarely leave the house &amp; now it's getting to the point where I feel like an adult if I even think about wearing pants. I have a problem.
I don't think #hobbema's name change is gonna give its town the face-lift it hopes it will. #alberta
Hair goals 2014: learn how to make it hold its curl or cut it, cause this is bullshit.
New Year's resolution: I resolve to not make resolutions on arbitrary dates. Self-reflect and change always.
There's no place like 3 hours away from home for the holidays. Or forever. #mymistake #holidayblues
#christmas #caesars 
@DrPantaloon Haha, yeaaaaah.
Gordon is singing "Winds of Change" whole having a poop. I guess it was a success?
Pretty sure that almost everything I know about #dinosaurs came from the Land Before Time. #knowthefacts
#hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit #hobbit
@DrPantaloon Never. How could I forget?
@DrPantaloon Well now that I've fondled you, I would prefer you undress.
@DrPantaloon I would prefer you pants-less. You never undress for me though. :(
@LethbridgeCity Not sure who to ask or where to find out when the Annandale Christmas House on London Road is open. Help a girl out?
@DrPantaloon We now have a month to have many bitchfests. Let's do it up! No better time than the holidays!
Oh hi, twitter. I couldn't find you buried under the five thousand things I had to do during practicum!
Got notes like this all day long from my students. Needless to say, it's been a bit tearful. Can't… 
@DrPantaloon Meeee toooooo.
“@tobyflendersons: it takes a devoted woman to shave her legs let alone her thighs good lord” Literally how I feel all summer long.
I finally thought of a funny line to use for this random text, only to have them (eventually) tell me… 
Random texts from unknown numbers are such a special thing to receive. I f*ck it up every time b/c I'm the opposite of witty. Heartbreaking.
Bucket List: I would love to offer free hugs for a day. Or a week. #hugs
Reminder: As of tomorrow, there's exactly 1 month until @TheHobbitMovie Pt 2 comes out. Am excited. If you love me, you're excited for me.
The most dangerous point in the night is always when you start to think "I should stay up" instead of "I should sleep". #upat6am #sleepy
@DrPantaloon They needed a pick-me-up anyways.
@charles_logie Or a house.
@charles_logie Let's put all the project bikes in your bedroom.
Yes mom, I wanted to spend my evening on my younger sister's social networks spying on her for you.
@DrPantaloon Haha we didn't actually check. I mixed that idea the moment it escaped Gordon's lips!
My front kidney (read: probably appendix) is hurting really bad &amp; Gordon said it's probably a sickly appendix. AM SCAARRRRED. #webmdthatshit
I'm really trying to be positive about this whole snow thing, but it can just f*ck off. I can be cozy w/o winter forcing me to be that way.
@min2xb I do my best!
I was into Irony before it was cool. #havenofearhipstersarehere
I mean, COME ON. The Fellowship breaking? Let me just use a box of Kleenex to take this all in.
I love &amp; hate people who put songs from #lotr on 8tracks. I applaud your good taste but hate that I'm sobbing while writing a paper.
@DrPantaloon Thanks! I found out when I took it out that it also curls my hair for me nicely!
Guys I did a hair thing that is neat. 
@DrPantaloon I may have shed a tear. Maybe, but probably not.
Just unceremoniously removed lip ring so I can be a real grownup and do teacher things. So long, teenage rebellion.
If I #fart on it, it's mine. #kidrules #toothumor
I wrote words for a dear friend of mine. Confused Chatter From a (Probably) Feminist 
@DrPantaloon Me too!
So proud to be here for @Gordullet's #uleth convocation! #BScGeography 
I'm way too happy about my #koala #onesie. #treehugger 
Whelp, they emailed me everything but my placement today :( Just wanna know where I'm teaching already!
@DrPantaloon I like the black!
@DrPantaloon Yaaaay!
Whelp, I guess I have to direct my Lukasuk anger via my personal twitter now.
Just ate 2 man-sized plates of #thanksgiving dinner. So full, but no regrets. Bring on the pie. 
Nothing like the Thanksgiving weekend to take in every bit of dirty laundry your family has. #whatamithankfulfor
The fox says shut the hell up because I'm tired if your bullshit.
@sllogie lol I'm all ears!
To Boyfriend: Apparently it's "Coming Out Day" so if you have something to tell me you can say it now. Turns out he's gay. #whoops
Serenaded multiple times with "Baby Beluga" in the shower this morning. Am giddy, to say the least.
Still waiting for that Nigerian Prince to get back to me ... Dude takes his time.
@DrPantaloon You forgot me!
@evkmack @MitchyD It was eggcelent.
@evkmack We're here
@evkmack Fantastic!
@evkmack If that's too soon just let me know!
@evkmack We're ready to leave the uni soon, actually. Meet around 5?
@evkmack What time? Also, Gordon and I carpooled, so he may come along, if that's alright.
This seems very @DrPantaloon ish. 
@evkmack In that case, still on for Mojo's tonight?
Boyfriend walked up to me with the choppy bit of the magic bullet not entirely aware why he did it. Should I be worried?
@evkmack Sounds good to me!
@evkmack This weekend is looking insane. Definitely thinking Thurs. evening. Is there a taco night/other cheap food night on the west side?
@SMART_Tech Your software is abysmally non-intuitive. Your help section is just as bad. Please provide better support, or a better software.
I am actually tweeting in Japanese professionally. This makes me profoundly happy and proud.
My professional tweet number will surpass my personal tweet number probably within a few weeks. How that are happen?
@evkmack It's definitely forcing me to revamp my time management strategies. Love my class too - they feel like family already!
@evkmack Next week is looking a little iffy until Thursday - just a lot of projects coming due. Surviving Ed &amp; loving it! You?
@evkmack I could not be more enthusiastic about this statement.
@evkmack Me too! This is crazy - I can't keep it organized, and I'm an organization nut!
@min2xb Actually though, I don't remember. That was a whole day ago haha
@min2xb Well, you know how I think my shit don't stink.
@DrPantaloon Look at all your wrinkles and grey hair. Might as well bust out the wheelchair and ancient hard candies right now.
Am sick. Am sad. Send help.
Should I be ashamed or proud of a double-flush poo? #tmi? #lifequestion
I did 8 hours of group work today. EIGHT HOURS. #wekilledthatgroupproject
WOW AND LITTLE HOLLY ALL SCARED IN THAT FIRE TRUCK. BLERGH. LIKE LEAVING A BABY ON A DOORSTEP BUT NOT. AM CRYYYYYYYYY.
WALT LET HANK DIE AND EVERYTHING IS BAD AND AM SAD WANT TO CRY. #BreakingBad
You know that every time Safety Dance comes on, I will match around my basement like nobody's business. #MenWithoutHats
#HobbitDay today!
It took a week, but I finally have all seasons of the #Gargoyles.
I've read 300 pages of a single textbook in the last two weeks. Am sad.
@DrPantaloon I just read 150 pages of EsPsych. Help us both.
I can't believe there was ever a time where I actually hated chai tea.
"I too like play classroom still." - a full grown teacher.
It's the National Finals. I didn't know this show existed, but I've somehow become invested. I may have just shouted at the tv.
What a mistake I've made watching American Ninja Warrior.
@DrPantaloon Yeah, I can't complain!
Drinking coolers and playing Super Mario Galaxy. #homealone
@DrPantaloon WHERE IS THIS MAGIC.
#kijiji is one of the most agonizing and hopeful things in existence.
Downloading #Gargoyles because it was literally my #1 favorite show when I was a kid. #saturdaymorningcartoons?
#sunflower #selfie 
The thing about being in Ed is that you live in it. 6 courses in 8 weeks - I'm already drowning in schoolwork.
I picked the wrong time to be in the pool area. #saynotospeedos
Very unexpected text from @nakagake this afternoon. Bahahaha! 
@DrPantaloon Mine's meagan@fullerton.lee. Let's emailchatblog each other.
I am rocking the plant world this summer. #plants #tomatoes 
I am such a @google fangirl. Too bad that @weebly totally destroyed Google in website creation. Professional Portfolio creation for the win!
I have to fill out a favorite book list on a questionnaire for my teacher LOLS. He doesn't know what he's done haha! #uleth #ulethed
I am not ready for school to start tomorrow. Or ever. #uleth
@DrPantaloon Wow. You've got guts! Maybe I'll work up the courage in the next couple of years haha.
@DrPantaloon You're so brave.
Explaining the internet to those who don't get it is absolutely excruciating. Good thing this is my Co-op final report. #exerciseinpatience
Just realized my #vhs collection is larger than my #dvd collection. Whoops. #kickinitoldschool?
Arranged my mini bookshelves into read and not-read books. Am happy. #book #love
Bertha is spoiled today. Hand washed her, cleaned her out, and now I'm giving her a rust spot treatment. Spa day! #yql #summer #carwash
Good garage sale purchase. #Pokemon 
Feck you, Brad. You ruined my #pokemon happiness this fine evening, you feckin' jerk.
Having a super productive day but that's because I'm not working. Hmmm....
All summer I have been trying to decide which day of the paper I like the most. Torn between F and Sa. I definitely hate Sunday's. #yql
GRRM can go suck some milk. Erm, that came out wrong. Just like it did in the book. #sexynotscary #breastmilkmishaps
My #sunflower could turn and face me any time now. Stop poking over the neighbor's fence and ignoring me. I wanna see your pretty face.
It sure seems like George R. R. Martin conceived the Game of Thrones series so he could play out his sexual fantasies. Awesome.
@charles_logie Really nice shot!
I very much judge you based on your #wifi locale name. If it doesn't sit well, I'm out.
It occurs to me that I have not enough David Bowie on my computer/iPod. Remedying this. #shameshame
EVERYBODY LOOK AT HOW MY #SUNFLOWER IS STARTING TO FLOWER YAY!!! 
Seriously @tumblr WHY YOU MAKE STRANGERS POSTS APPEAR ON MY DASH?!
[makes a video of every #BreakingBad cold open bc they're all exquisitely creepy]
@tobyflendersons MINE TOO BLERGH.
#BreakingBad season 2 ep 1cold open is all kinds of terrifying and bizarre. I like it.
Eventful day: saw a semi obliterate a fawn and almost got hit by it, #Lundbreck falls and Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump. Lots of massacre.
My sandals broke and Gordon broke my toe while dancing with the transvestite. Bed time. #wedding #celebrations

I'm so popular I got proposed to twice tonight. #engagement
Omg so a transvestite at this wedding just forced Gordon to "propose" to me.
Life goal: I just danced with a transvestite in a body suit. Good night.
Best line of the night so far: "I don't have a prostate but I can still be loved." #wedding #celebration
Btw, the shower man sounded like a burly biker man. Given that we're in a #motorcycle campground, I may be right. Still unsettling, though.
Oh wait. A family that's with the wedding group offered us coffee + #baileys. Things are looking up! #camping
The coldest shower I've ever had + man in the stall next to me groaning about his good shower makes for an unpleasant morning. #camping
The most terrifying thing to try and sleep with: a wasp buzzing outside your tent trying to get in. #camping
@tobyflendersons Oh my god, I actually use it a ridiculous amount now.
I mean, where the feck was I when this was first popular. Such good tv.
Holy crap is the pilot episode for #BreakingBad literally the best ever pilot episode for a tv show I've ever seen.
Every time I've gone #camping in the last three years, I've been on my #period. What kind of sore #luck is that, Mother Nature?
@DrPantaloon :( It is particularly unpleasant this month.
Ooooh man back pain. The Bloodshed is coming.
"Twerk" is the stupidest f*cking word. I just hate it so much. Take your ridiculous #twerk elsewhere, and come back here and #shakedatass.
The only thing making this blah work day bearable is periodically ogling my wishlist on @bookdepository. And impromptu dance sessions. #whew
If only the Champion wasn't there. Boo. #pokemon #gold
I just undressed @DrPantaloon and made her even hotter. 
@DrPantaloon True love. Obviously.
Barefoot Gen is literally the most terrifying and disturbing animated movie I've seen. @charles_logie you're going to give me nightmares.
@DrPantaloon LIES
Hanging out in the kitchen with #totoro. No totoros were hurt in the process. 
@schill_dawg @LethbridgeCity Agreed. While they're at it, why not clean up some of the mud that's been sitting on the pathways for yeeears.
The best opportunity to touch everyone's butts is on a public toilet. #butts
@lethtraffic @LethbridgeCity It's unacceptable that it took so long. Erratic weather made it difficult but Leth bounced back fast each time.
@lethtraffic @LethbridgeCity It dried up relatively fast every time. All the rocks are a hazard to motorcyclists, pedestrians and cyclists.
@lethtraffic @LethbridgeCity True that. Though the May-early June part of summer left plenty of time to get all the street sweeping done.
@LethbridgeCity @lethtraffic Good thing this is being done at the end of the summer. At this rate, you *might* get done in time for winter.
Leader Clair is such a bitch. #pokemon
I have played a ridiculous amount of Pokemon in the last two days. Oh wait. No amount of #pokemon is too much.
@DrPantaloon Who ya gonna call?
@DrPantaloon I'm trusting you! I better not be let down!
My #togepi evolved. I am torn about this.
4 of my #pokemon evolved and I obtained 3 gym badges today. Decent Sunday. #nostresszone
@DrPantaloon I guess it can fend for itself?
@DrPantaloon You are the worst mother.
We have a month left till school starts. Where the heck did #summer go?
In other news, I'm absolutely terrible at mini golf.
C'mon, anchor tag. Work, goddamnit.
@DrPantaloon Her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...
@DrPantaloon EUUUUUUGH IT WAS. It ROLLOUT-STOMPed all my money away. Stupid cow.
@DrPantaloon Oh, what's that? Did you say something? I couldn't hear you over the not-listening.
Goddamnit, Miltank. #pokemon
#sunburn crisis averted!
Discussing the merits of shaking a baby with a 5 year old is always refreshing. #shakeitup
Tomorrow's schedule: remain indoors. apply lotion to burns. repeat.
Does Rainn Wilson follow Val Kilmer on twitter because hipster sarcasm or some other obscure reason? #confused
Sunscreen could not have saved me from the #lethbridge international air show today. #yql #crispy 
Such a tragedy that #coffee smells so much better than it tastes. #FirstWorldProblems
Gardening and watching the planes come in for the air show. Awesome! #yql
#drinking protip: find the bathroom and get used to toilet height whilst sober so that no confusion happens when tipsy.
@charles_logie nice pic!
Now that we're done #30Rock we're heartbroken and don't know what to do. #30Rockproblems
Whoops. Bought another #gameboy tonight. And got me some #pokemon #gold on the side.
I will finally be in possession of a #gameboy tomorrow! All my dreams come true!
According to Lily, I'm the #mother of 24 blanketed #babies. Cheaper by the #dozen? 
C'mon, #kijiji, stop failing me with all your #gameboy offers. All you people suck ass. Respond! #kijijiproblems
Out of all things to put on a #vanity plate, you choose SPUDBOY? Really? Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew. Not a license plate. #spud
@DrPantaloon No you don't.
Accidentally learned some kind of coding today while building a class blog/website for work. Whoops.
Damage assessment: mosquitoes +50, Meagan 0. Sun +5, Meagan 0. Rough weekend, but worth it for such amazing geology! #dinosaurs #hoodoos #ab
Put butter in my coffee this morning. Today is off to a good start.
@charles_logie I feel threatened.
Whilst lying in bed awake at 2 AM, I've discovered one of our neighbors secretly engages in The Marijuana. The horror. #sleepytime
Never ever EVER is it okay for a #britneyspears song to be an #epithet in a #book. Ew. 
I am just THE GRUMPIEST right now. Euuuuugh. #grumpy #badday
"[Meagan], you wouldn't just die in the wild. You'd die in a grocery store." - @Gordullet on my eating habits. #food
With all the cleanup I have to do in our basement today, I feel even worse for High River residents returning home.
Definitely wanted to spend my evening vacuuming the same small patch of carpet over and over in an attempt to get the water out. Sigh.
@lethtraffic @lethnews Most of 13 st N of 9 Ave N is underwater. 
The rain cometh in my freakin' basement. Euuuurgh.
I just ate like 400 maple leaf sprinkles that had fallen off their maple leaf cookies. #patriotism?
@nakagake I'm popping your @twitter cherry! Welcome!
May have just found my plant soulmate on @soulpancake. Joy!
Japan is fun. #japan #rollingstones #MickJagger 
(-): 3/5 #books pertained to the Holocaust. Hard to believe something so ghastly isn't fiction. Impossible to consider such atrocities. #lit
(+): I turned my "2 books behind" in my Reading Challenge to "3 books ahead" in a week! A book a day keeps the boredom away! #lit #books
@DrPantaloon whilst serenaded with a shirtless PJ. The night is picking up!
@DrPantaloon I'm secretly Mormon. That's the right one, right?
Life accomplishment: For the first time ever, finally tan enough that my skin matches the color of a Band-Aid. Movin' on up in the world.

You know you're 100 when you say something was a "hoot". Please just leave that to the owls.
When someone says "think tank" all I can think of is brains congregating in a fish tank.
"the C, almost D grades left laying on the floor or computer screen like a used condom" - Nathan Khallil. #TryingTooHard
I mean, seriously. "Chief Operator at Musculation Workout 500"? What will all my crazy middle-aged followers think?
Why the hell does Facebook have followers like twitter? So glad my fb profile is closed. Body-Builder McGee looks scary.
The Gambles' wedding is topped off with a drunken decision that produced many fish. Welcome to the… 
I are bad at wedding things.
Notes from the wedding today: I need dance lessons.
Mourning the destruction of the town I was born in (Bragg Creek) and the town I grew up in (Sundre). Let's get a hair dryer for the province
I very much prefer the #vine that you can swing off of in the jungle.
Am I too old to still have a favorite bowl, favorite spoon, etc.? #grownup
@charles_logie (2/2) results and motivations would surface here. So unfortunate.
@charles_logie Agreed. I feel like a lots of Americans don't realize they're powerless &amp; if they did see this, I'm not sure the same (1/2)
I did not just finish #lego #lotr and I'm not crying about it I swear.
Just hanging out at Minas Tirith. Woot woot. #lego #lotr
Killing baby spiders sucks. Especially when they're Shelob's. But I killed her, too. NBD. #lego #lotr
Sometimes I forget that the Internet has resources. Need a little Gargoyles in your life? PirateBay to the rescue.
Lemon yogurt is just the worst goddamn shit. Don't get me wrong, I love lemons, but lemon yogurt can kiss my ass.
Watching 30 Rock makes me want to sort of make babies with Tina Fey. We both have this awkward slob thing going.
So now just wandering around in Rivendell. NBD. #lego #lotr
A literal #sun #flower in #yql blooms in the evening sky. #summer #nofilter 
@DrPantaloon FINE. *walks away brokenhearted*
What are these 3 E's you speak of? What are they did do today? Working people gotta work, yo.
Good thing to know that Frodo is just as whiny in #lego #lotr as he is in the movies.
THE SHIRE. THE SHIRE IN #LEGO #LOTR IS LOVE.
I want to make so many babies with Cate Blanchett. Ohmigoodness
I want me a One Ring so bad. Too bad they're so energy-sucking to produce.
Loving me my #lego #lotr on my #vita already, and I've only sat through the introductory stuff. Mmmmm.
@tobyflendersons That's what she said.
Today's accomplishment. Meagan 1, #calgary #book fair 0. 
@ULethbridgeEdu Thank you! I am really excited for this opportunity! :)
#thunderstorm #sunset #yql #lethbridge #alberta 
@DrPantaloon How is Indian good so good that we reduce ourselves to animals for it?
I did not just lick the butter chicken sauce off my plate.
@ulethbridge Thank you! :)
Got my acceptance letter for the Faculty of Ed! Yay! #uleth
If I have kids, they better appreciate the fact I have to haul these fat-bags around for them to exploit.
Looking beautiful in #yql. #whoopup #bridge #sunset #walk 
Oh man. Book came in mail that I forgot I ordered. And I bought too many books yesterday. And buying more on Sat. #reasonsineedanewbookshelf
Why does reading in the sun not like my skin? :( #summer #yql
Love me some wrong number texts. I have a sex name now. I saved this text for so long. 
I reeeeeallly need another bookshelf.
I present to you a #tumblr #gem 
Dear Ms. Samad: I want my #million #pounds from Dhabi please. #spam #spammail #manchester 
@DrPantaloon Or breakfast. Mmmmm.
Let me rant about how my dad forgot my birthday. I'm only his first child, that he hardly ever gets to see. #sigh #sorryforpassivetweet
Smashing reality: I will never be a sun-dweller. #summer #yql
Fetched myself a bunch of #lilacs for my #birthday :) 
Surprise marriages/weddings just freak me out. I have no time to absorb that these two happy people are preparing for their life together!
Lineham Creek Trail. #thesticks #waterton #alberta #hiking 
Just went on my first solo motorcycle ride! That much closer to getting my license this summer!
@DrPantaloon If one of them ever gets a girlfriend I'm sure they'll share that too.
@DrPantaloon To store not only his porn collection, but his brother's. they share the same room so, y'know, efficiency. Ick.
@DrPantaloon I'm terrified of how much more could be clogging his hard drive.
Survived the hike! #waterton #linehamtrail
The funny thing about B &amp; T rating women on a hotness scale is that they have no hope in hell of getting anything above a 1.
Aaaand Brett just told me he deleted 800GB of porn off his computer.
Going hiking with Travis and Brett. If I don't come back, it's because they fed me to the bears.
Rice Krispies are the worst possible cereal to give a child. All that happens is that they Rice Krispy under your feet when the kid is done.
@tobyflendersons Cheap Starbucks with more food. And so many donuts.
Translating into Japanese has given me a whole new respect for taking a mother tongue/language for granted. #language #caetl #uleth
I just watched the last episode of #theoffice series and I am totally not okay. Heartbroken is a good description.

Beautiful night for a stroll in the coulees. Edge of the world. #yql #summer 
Coulee walk turns up a #cactus stickman. #thesticks #yql 
@DrPantaloon Disappoint.
@DrPantaloon Shame on you. This is madness.
Don't mind me while I bawl my eyes out at the end of #lotr
Lord of the Rings day today! #lotr
@DrPantaloon You are the cleverest!
@DrPantaloon Mother Nature must think she's so clever. Stupid biotch.
Oh good. Mother Nature decided to celebrate Bryan's graduation today too. #periodtweet
What are big sisters for if not to publicly berrate their younger sisters on #fb at their mother's request? #grownup #adulthood
One of my favorite little girls to babysit. &lt;3 So lucky to be connected with this family. #love #happy 
Move-in day! #moving #yql #boxes #unpacking #phew 
Sometimes the Lethbridge Swap and Buy has some gems that you just can't not share with the world. #yql 
Look what I found on my phone! @charles_logie 's #selfie ! #instafamous ? 
Literally the coolest #puzzle piece ever. #butterfly 
Oh my. My brother made me play #CoD tonight. #scaredypants
@min2xb If you find something especially strange or unique while abroad, my name's on it!
Pizza, drinks and @CanadiensMTL on the screen = good visit with my dad. #GoHabsGo
Pseudo-vacations in Lethbridge are possible! #summer #yql 
12am and I am still studying for this stupid #exam that I've been ready for for 2 days and why doesn't it just happen already. #rant #uleth
"I don't even write good". The reason you don't write good can be found in that shitty sentence construct.
Study break in lethbridge lodge while mom and @funky_lady101 visit! 
The @mothermother #MMmob. Want in? 
"Brett just doesn't like big butts that don't lie". I am forever, ever sad to know this. #butts #lies
@DrPantaloon Me too. And if I'm really scared I stop looking at the screen and die anyways.
@DrPantaloon Every time I play, my heart races like crazy. Then I console myself by playing the 1st level, b/c I can do that w/o dying.
You have not experienced fear until you've played a #Mario level that evolves into a shitstorm.
@charles_logie !!!!!!
@charles_logie Eugh.
@charles_logie If you have stinky feet, then I beg of you to wear socks. It would be a shame for me to die before I saw your face.
@charles_logie Good! This one will knock your socks off. Probably.
@charles_logie If you say so :p Also, I have a surprise for you, but I have to wait until you get back, because I must see your reaction.
@charles_logie But my mom is coming down to visit, and she usually brings crappy weather with her, so ... mayhap end of April snowstorm.
@charles_logie Hurrah hurrah! We're supposed to have good weather this weekend!
@charles_logie Do you know when exactly you're leaving for/arriving back in beautiful #yql ?
@charles_logie @drpantaloon Dearest Charles, It is a date. Xoxo, @DrPantaloon and moi
@cmtbonifacio It went alright, I think. Also, don't be too excited, my grad is a long ways away yet!
@cmtbonifacio Looks good!
@cmtbonifacio Is that curled hair? And makeup? Wow!
I hope Charlie doesn't jump on this. Packing are hard! 
@DrPantaloon Thank ya!
@ulethbridge Thanks! :)
If this looks daunting, that's because it was. This is the definition of insanity. And hopefully success. #uleth 
@DrPantaloon I can't even feel bad for him. I deleted his voicemail like 2 sentences in, which was somewhat satisfying. I wish I'd kept it.
@DrPantaloon Oh la la!
@DrPantaloon I suppose I do too. But also, Friday.
@DrPantaloon Indeed! He's simultaneously headstrong and headweak! It was infuriating!
@DrPantaloon Why is it not Friday yet? This week is taking FOREVER.
The last thing I want is a ranting voicemail from stupidcousin telling me 9/11 happened. I know it did, but thx 4 noting my intelligence.
@DrPantaloon I ... think that's how it works?
@DrPantaloon Abstinence is key.
Why can't the rest of my hair curl naturally like this? #hair #curl #girlytweet 
@LPIRG @ULethSU  I appreciate your #ABPSE protests, etc., but it would have been nice to do some MWF, when I actually have classes :(
The true indicator of a successful paper is carpal tunnel in BOTH OF YOUR GOSH-DARN HANDS. This baby better get me an A+.
World, tell me how to tell my little sister why she shouldn't join the Word of Life church, even if all the cool kids are doing it.
@charles_logie Should be sooner, methinks.
@charles_logie Haha they might! Do you have an estimate of when you're gonna be back?
@charles_logie Alright. But if they accidentally die then I'm okay with that.
I get really excited when people phone me ... But 9 times out of 10, it's someone with the wrong number.
@charles_logie Everything is dumb and sad and I just want to kill someone so when you get back let's go cry together over spudnuts.
Gaaah. Haven't had to present to a class in 1.5 years. I've practiced this speech like 30 times this week, hopefully it pans out tomorrow!
@DrPantaloon I have an anthro one that's being peer reviewed an that I have to fix up for next Friday. I present on another this Friday :(
@DrPantaloon Feel better and good luck! My wrist is acting up really bad too :(
@charles_logie @gordullet I hope you mean as close as it comes to love, rather than the truth of the statement.
@gordullet describes me as a corpse that shouldn't go on jeopardy. Love?
Nothing feels better than finalizing a 30-page paper your wrote on your own. Take that, Meso-Anth. #uleth
@google is so clever! #google #chrome 
Gonna watch me the Hobbit with Emma, Lily and Erika! Ladies night (of sorts), woot!
Man, applying for jobs is the worst. Just give me all the money I need, already, capitalism.
@DrPantaloon He's pretty old. And it would cheer him up from being sick last week!
@DrPantaloon Nice job!
@rainnwilson Also, we'll protect you from Mance Raider and the Wildlings in the North. #WinterIsComing #Canada
@sllogie How annoying! I don't know if there is any way you can block this aside from changing your password :(
@sllogie Is this a spam message?
@ulethbridge Co-op means Opportunity and Passion to pursue what I want. #coopweek
My fave thing about Co-op is the rockin' co-op advisors! Always so upbeat and enthusiastic! #coopweek
 @ulethbridge
@sllogie Haha, very clever! And good to know. Hopefully, this'll get my essay from 0 to 100% in no time!

Just made a Dodge Charger reference in my Anthro essay about Mayas. Man, I hope this doesn't backfire.
Thank you, OWL Purdue, for keeping up with the times! Finally, all of my MLA citation needs are fulfilled. 
@ulethbridge
@charles_logie right?! Prepared for every situation!
@Gordullet @charles_logie Out of love, I would eat you so you wouldn't have to go through the moral horrors of eating me.
@charles_logie Saving him for when we're stuck on an island and there's nothing else to eat.
@charles_logie He's not worth enough. Like the Mayas, the gods need something intelligent. That rules Charlie out.
@charles_logie I'll do some hoodoo vooshit. So far, failure. Maybe I need to sacrifice something?
@charles_logie I was thinking of fleeing to Mexico.
@charles_logie Are you making the long journey north now? If so, you're coming back to shitty weather.
So far this semester, I have written the equivalent of half a master's thesis. Second half of the semester for the win? #uleth
Men Without Hats - Where are they now?
Never forget to look to the sky. #alberta #sun #winter #trees #canada #uleth 
Beautiful Southern Alberta morning! 
@DrPantaloon I seem to be lacking the vodka part. Note to self: invest in liquor cabinet for bedroom.
@DrPantaloon Eugh can I join you. Everything is wooooooooorst.
Robbie Robertson's talk voice is a terrifying thing to hear in a room alone. I'm scared to look under the bed or in my closet. Help!
@charles_logie Look at all the job opportunities in Mexico! Maybe you should just stay there!
Social networks, you are not distract-y enough from all of the homework/studying I'm supposed to be doing! #uleth
An #english classmate clearly feels my pain. #solidarity #uleth 
I think I am gonna start advertising my height and race in my Facebook name. I'll probably get more chicks that way. 
Please don't pronounce particular "perticular." Just don't. Don't even open your mouth. #perticular #particular #shutupsam

@Gordullet Your dear brother @LogieHugh has entered the netherspace of twitter!
@LogieHugh Welcome to the twitter world!
Re: Samurai: "Their swagger and swords set them off from ordinary people." Swagger. 16th century samurai swagger.
Finally have my own French press for my loose-leaf tea-steeping joy!
So glad I just paid a month and a half's rent on my eyeballs.
Out of context: Because straight Jager isn't for quitters.
@sllogie Sorry! It's been a trying few weeks. :(
Now accepting applications for new family members. Qualifications: don't be an insufferable prick! #sorrryforvaguepersonaltweet
@cmtbonifacio Christmas gift from Gordon's dad!
Starting the third George R. R. Martin book. #bebrave #oncemorewithconviction
Does anyone remember using Netscape? #seehowfarwehavecome
@cmtbonifacio Totally worth it. I feel like I'm holding the future in my hands. So inspiring!
@min2xb My sentiments exactly!
@min2xb Did you acquire a copy of Rocky Horror yet? Must.Watch. #rhps
@cmtbonifacio You should check out this book called Massive Change. Lots of forward thinking people wanting to design around the environment
My poor Charlie and I have been sick the last few days. :( Let's kick this shit, Charlie!
The only time it's acceptable for a man to be leering at me by the window while smacking his lips is when he's my cat.
@DrPantaloon I own one! Rachelle gave it to me last Christmas!
@sllogie Must be!!
More people have gotten engaged in the last 3 months than weddings I've been to in my life! Something in the air? Nonetheless, congrats!!
Scored a parking pass for next semester for $50 off. Yesssssss! #uleth
I have been wanting eggnog ALL MONTH, but roommates steal tasty things :(
@sllogie Found you! Haha!
@DrPantaloon Sorry :( No harm meant.
@DrPantaloon you were always an old hen. We both are.
Just gleefully completed downloading over 10 Christmas albums! #ilovechristmaswaytoomuch
Cat-napping with my cat is the best kind of cat-nap.
@funky_lady101 Would you delete this shit and stop spamming everybody please?
I'm looking for free  Spread the Word! @

Has her some Unexpected Journey tickets for 10PM Dec. 14th!! Woooo! #TheHobbit
I am winning at no-shave November.
@DrPantaloon The classroom filled. I missed my chance!
It sounded like someone was jerking off behind me in this empty classroom. I are scared.
@charles_logie No, you can call it "art" and make millions off it now!
What a beautiful morning! #yql #uleth @ University of Lethbridge 
I feel like #canada cares more about #america 's politics than their own. Hmmm....
I realize I'm not American, and this is my first political tweet ever. But dear god, don't inflict the country with #Romneysia
Roommates, shut the FUCK up about #Romney. C'mon USA #vote #Obama
Erm. It's dark at 5:20 PM. Ick. #yql #leth
Do you know a Canadian student who needs $20K for school? If so, pls RT this opportunity 
Such an emotional weekend. #whew
Has three uni jobs at the same time. Moneeeeey. #uleth
Sometimes, I miss T9 Word a bit.
And fuck off roommates that make the house so cold that boiling water can induce a significant temperature change.
Fuck off, fire alarm that gets set off by boiling water. Also, fuck off at being set off because of temperature change from said water.
Charlie couldn't fall asleep on me till I would hold his paw. D'awww. #reasonswhyilovemycat
@jennafischer Just watched TGMM. Finally, I feel validated. A little less solitaire. Thank you to you and Lee.
@min2xb It's more madness that uni is even open. Was gonna go to class 8AM till I heard snow plows were in the ditch.
I'm glad I live in a household where eating ice cream out of the 1.65L carton is totally acceptable.
Dentist :(
Look what I came home to! Thanks Sam! #flowers 
@min2xb I'm still trying to find out where the fuck all of mine came from. Was I adopted? :p

Got the job 10 minutes later! Win Interview! #uleth
Job interview done. #phew Feelin' good about it.
Job interview in 25 minutes. #nervous #uleth
This weather is already making me moody and sad. Fuck off, Mother Nature.
Don't ask me if "problematic" is in my vocabulary, Drama Professor.
Watching The Little Mermaid. Contented.
I like Tim Curry a lot more on the second round. I'm sorry, world.
Coming to Leth with VHS player and VHS videos out the wazoo. Weekend=success. Bowie, you're so pretty on VHS.
The view out my dad's front window. I hope this house stays in our family forever. #home 
4 days till #RockOfAges comes out on DVD, and I'm giddy as a 1980's frizzy-haired school girl.
Breakfast. It's Halloween soon, right? Tis the season for breakfasts like these! 
Finished a single-spaced, two page paper tonight. #check
THE WEEKEND IS MINE. #HappyThanksgiving
Started a single-spaced two page paper tonight. #check
@charles_logie Haha, and they didn't even feed you after. What meanies!
@charles_logie Blood is in you to give, not to be tested. You're doing it wrong!
@DrPantaloon @min2xb they were my first ever CD haha
Smell like campfire. Came home and Charlie was purring when he knew it was our bed time. #perfect
@lethtraffic @MarcelJepson Bridge drive (that was under construction) is now open?
Charlie and I reading together &lt;3 #kittylove #cat #reading 
Just spent 25 min editing someone's 160 word text. I'm glad first year "grammar" has evaded me.
@min2xb Worth it!
@min2xb Happy monthsary to you guys as well!
@min2xb Awe! It was our 23 monthsary yesterday!
Montana, I like your bush. #Montana #USA
@DrPantaloon And then, I wonder if I'm being too anal about things.
@DrPantaloon Exactly! Japanese prof uses Comic Sans in all her handouts she gives us. Drives me nuts.
@DrPantaloon I hate that font. It just looks so juvenile and ugly.
@DrPantaloon Jealous. Ice creeeeeeam.
Turns out mint chocolate tea just tastes like mint. #sigh
#LOTR reference in my logic class? Obviously, I made the right choice. &lt;3
I am really sad about being on the wrong end of Epplett's beard cycle. It was so glorious.
1st time at karate tonight. Never have I felt less in control of my limbs. #sigh #LOL
@DrPantaloon The comfiest. I probably will never change out of them. I also don't want to wash the cozy out of them.
@DrPantaloon The BEST. Literally the first thing I did when I got home is put on a pair of those pj bottoms.
We got #HelloKitty down!
#hellokitty 
@lethtraffic Detour onto E Crowsnest when heading S on Scenic Drive N
The least they could do with destroying these coulees is give us hot construction workers to ogle, but nooo. #sigh #yql #construction
The Sackboys miss air conditioning. #ottawa #yql #alberta #lethbridge  
Excited for no PST/HST, highways at 110 km/h, no crappy roommates, #school and #FRIENDS :D
Yay! Back in #Alberta and headed for #lethbridge! #yql #roadtrip
Also, WTF is this dry heat business? I'm getting chapped lips and dry skin like its winter... #Ottawa humidity, you have spoiled my skin! :p
Had my first time driving a car again in almost four months. Haha, a bit rusty #LOL
@min2xb This pleases me so much!
Last look at Parliament before we head home. #ottawa #canada  @ Major's Hill Park 
Love the smell of fresh cut grass! #grass #ottawa   @ Major's Hill Park

Packing for the long journey home! #ottawa #lethbridge #yql #roadtrip #whydoiha  @ The Dalhousie House, 161B 
@min2xb D'awwww!
Going out cottage-ing with Lidia on our last weekend in Ottawa!
@DrPantaloon When you're a grownup you'll be like one of those hoarders. Except in place of stacks of newspapers, it'll all be books.
@cmtbonifacio Haha don't we all! #LOL
@cmtbonifacio You're way more informed than a lot of people, and that counts for a lot :)
@cmtbonifacio Ahaha thanks! I try my best. I'll work on this though, but you're definitely an #inspiration !
@DrPantaloon At least it's a healthy addiction!
@cmtbonifacio What's this? You're so down with all these different causes. It makes me ashamed... I know nothing of anything haha!
Do you know a Canadian student who needs $20K for school? If so, pls RT this opportunity 
Exactly two weeks until I'm back in Lethbridge! So excited! #yql #roadtrip #AB
@cmtbonifacio I totally saw "menstruation". I had to read it five times before I saw that was not the word.
@cmtbonifacio Wow nice! It's like a working holiday!
@cmtbonifacio Have fun! Good luck!
I did not just see a seagull drool. No.
Caesars and buddies on a Friday night. #TGIF 
I've had such a large amount of Kool-Aid the last two days. Feel like a little kid again!
@min2xb Haha, I know right?
Pathetic but funny joke on Tiny Tower. #LOL 
This is my cousin. This level of police brutality is crap. 2 stories emerge from allegation of police brutality 
@cmtbonifacio I feel like there's so many snide remarks I could make about a stupid comment like this. That's just ridiculous!
@DrPantaloon Nooooooo!
@DrPantaloon Oh jeez. I am also okay with this. Movie buddies for all 3? Pinky promise?
@DrPantaloon The Hobbit 3 part movie thing!
@DrPantaloon Wha?
Conflicting emotions about being this close to Toronto. "wow cool!" and "holy f#ck traffic!" crossed our min 
@cmtbonifacio makes for an awesome role model for you and your sisters!
Cute kitties are cute. #cute #kitties 
@cmtbonifacio That's crazy! Good for her!
I only use this bookmark for the BEST books <GREEN HEART> 
@min2xb Hahaha I know! I've had good interactions with homeless people here, actually.
Just got serenaded by a drunk homeless man wearing a flowered shirt. Day complete.
Hitting up Niagara Falls this weekend!
@DrPantaloon I'm coming back to Leth to watch you rise. 5 AM and pretty!
Watching the sun rise in downtown Ottawa. Sleeping's for chumps. And there's something beautiful about it all. Gotta do it in Leth.
@DrPantaloon Are you practicing for when we meet again?
@WalkOffTheEarth Just the new, fresh kind of music I've been looking for. Can't believe I didn't discover you till now!
@DrPantaloon This makes me want to ride the bus with you ALL OF THE TIMES.
@charles_logie You shouuuuuuld!
@charles_logie And then you're coming to visit us in Ottawa again, right?
@min2xb Haha, I have no accent. I sound worse than a child speaking. But you will hear French. Or a variation thereof. XD
@min2xb So much! I was most improved in the whole program. I went from knowing nothing to talking lots, or at least better understanding.
@min2xb The one and only!
@min2xb yeah they had us in North Bay for French. Very few francophones, an the coordinators sucked. Teachers were good though.
@min2xb It was pretty good! North Bay is not the place to go though....
@min2xb haha no job. I was in O for 2 wks before I went to French. Now I'm back. Might find a job though.
@min2xb it was late. One of the benefits of being unemployed is you can sleep and wake whenever you want!
@min2xb So awesome! :p
@min2xb you had me worried!
@min2xb wwhaaaa? Everything okay?
@min2xb Perfect. Not too hot, used to the humidity. We had a glorious weekend! You?
@min2xb What a smart, productive cookie you are!
@ulethPRO Hey, I've been going to uleth for 2 years now, and I want to know how I can become part of the PRO team! :) Where can I get info?
@min2xb You're so dedicated! Haha, I would never stay up for work!
@min2xb Training for uni again already? :p
@min2xb Are the parents wanting a new home, or a new rental property?
@min2xb why?! Where?
@DrPantaloon Shoot, you're right. Screw those silly grannies!
@DrPantaloon The Purple Hat Ladies group for old women is calling you. :P
@DrPantaloon Yeah, it rots your brain. But nothing is worse than "Toddlers and Tiaras".
@DrPantaloon I had the sad experience of watching all TLC all the time while in North Bay b/c roommates. I'm horrified too.
@min2xb awe, you're so sweet! You have fun as well! Missing you... But Canada day in the capital!! Woot!
@_Pantaloon you disgust me. Just a bit. But I still love you.
@lethnews I found a really awesome green initiative! Freecycling! RT, and hopefully the community will join! 
I am eating really soggy cereal (albeit in yummy vanilla soy milk) and watching a sappy girl's movie. WTF is wrong with me?
"I REALLY don't wanna be a cock watcher."
@_Pantaloon I'm totally offended by your E3 spamming. How dare you? Oh ... wait .. there was mention of Mario. I'm good now. Spam away.
42% of the people following me are spammers linked to nasty websites. Dear god. I guess I should get me some Internet luvin'.
@cmtbonifacio I love that movie SO MUCH.
@cmtbonifacio hey-o!! You should follow "unconsumption" on tumblr. Really neat Eco-friendly and creative reuses of things!!
@min2xb will smile! It seems to be great so far!!
@min2xb haha, I already cried about it. It's gonna be tough! There's so many great people back home!
@min2xb I'm back! And just as white as when I left! It was fun! We're off to Ottawa today!!
@cmtbonifacio I love your "about you" section. So inspiring, so powerful! I wish I could word something nice like that.
Exams suck even more when you're stuck inside studying, rather than having water fights and going swimming. Open windows just don't cut it.
@charles_logie I found you. Be you follow me?


Just posted a photo

It takes two to whisper quietly. Give me a heavy dose of atmosphere.
Sigh. Still waiting. :/

Pretty disgusted that Sundre appears to be a suicide-breeding town now. 4th kid under 16 in less than three years. RIP Troy. &lt;/3
My baby's coming home today &lt;3

Hey, soul sister, hey there mister mister .... come back.
Thank god for good timed with friends
Miss me.
@min2xb Yeah, LET'S DO IT UP, AGAIN!!!!!!
@min2xb So sad :( I'm all about equality, man. Oh, I wish that theoretical communism was plausible....
Tonight we're gonna start by drinking on cheap bottles of wine, sit talking up all night...
And so the downfall of Canada begins. Let's all hide in our political bomb shelters for the next few years; maybe we'll be safe.
Mom wanted to watch a movie together tonight. We've been watching the aquarium channel.
Oh, what a child I am. Mario games make me jump. If only Mario were real life....
someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Love your heart. Love that rhythm. Love that you can love. Love what makes you love. Love your friends. Love yourself. Love.
20 Authors. 32 writing pieces. final Exam time. No big deal, right?
