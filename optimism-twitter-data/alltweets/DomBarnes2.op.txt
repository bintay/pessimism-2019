@Ad4kaynlilpLFC always the case especially at the bridge!!  career ender of a tackle
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC red all day long
YNWA !!! Always optimistic and hopeful never slate your own team my support is always there through good and bad times #fickle
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC things need to pick quickly just hope missing out on depay aren't a sign of Hingis to come
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC bit more optimism <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Mr_CallumWright  we miss out on yet another player !! Big miss aswell <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@woodhousecurtis bayern could do with Curtis just in front of the back 4 to sure things up and keep messi quiet
@woodhousecurtis there unplayable !!
@TransferSources but let's not forget that is also mayweathers yearly salary as boxing love sticking to the single fight a year these days <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_CallumMWright can't believe they've stooped so low it's not in the clubs DNA for things like this to happen #keepbrendan
@90thMin shambles
@BBCSporf @FootyHumour @Brewers06
@TrustyTransfers @Brewers06


@Ad4kaynlilpLFC I got a feeling it is but we will see
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC I got the impression it's a 433 can playing rb
Fuck it start samed yesil tonight and let the kid loose
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC 100% agreed depay is a great talent
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC we shall see what happens good discussion after getting off on the wrong foot <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC you are talking some very large transfer fees there but every player listed is an exciting prospect <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> depay Outwide aswell
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC getting someone young on a average wage who is ready to step in to lfc straight away and be a key man is very hard
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC would you take yaya on a two year deal ??
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC I think Delph would be good but I may see him fading in time McCarthy from Everton ? If possible
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC mig Clyne sakho can Moreno hendo naingollan Delph coutinho sturridge sterling Delph has grown on me massively
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC there's such fine lines in football is rather  Brendan sign big names and them fail than spend big money on 1 season wonders
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC Brendan is the man to take club forward I think his job security isnt questionable this year was always going to be tough
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC to be fair mignolet has had a quality second half to the season !! Has flano got a future as a permenant fb ??
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC I'd love some real big statement signings cech hummels veratti huggain type players but is that possible ??
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC how ambitious we can be with are transfer targets having not qualified for champions league will be interesting
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC I see what your saying bit for me striker is the big issue but I'd like to a whole new world class spine GK CB CM ST for me
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright I do not need to say anything else your argument is not valid 
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright goals win games not having a world class striker has been are downfall this year plus a few minor tweaks
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright have finished 0 0 and by winning are game in hand we'd be 2 points off United its factual not naive
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright yawn yawn !! It's all facts we created bags of chances of we had a world class finisher that game would not
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright United and would have a great chance of champions league football next year no one is being naive !!!
@Ad4kaynlilpLFC @_CallumMWright thick as shit pal arsenal game is irrelevant beating west brom and winning are game in hand we'd be 2 off
@_CallumMWright I can't believe Rodgers job security is being questioned its absolutely ludicrous I'd hope the club wouldn't stoop so low
@TrustyTransfers always had bags of ability
@craigpaul21 @paulparker77 @_CallumMWright a no brainer Young English got ability for me good addition to are squad
@craigpaul21 @paulparker77 @_CallumMWright  a big statement signing id hope for benzema/higuain/Isco type players but for a small fee it's
@craigpaul21 @paulparker77 @_CallumMWright Danny Ings would add massively to our squad for a very small fee    I'm not stating Ings would be
@craigpaul21 @paulparker77 @_CallumMWright Ricky lambert is 11 years older than Ings age is a big factor in this arguement Jesus Christ !!!
@paulparker77 understand your opinion 100% if there was a big fee involved but there's not if it doesnt work so be it surely worth a gamble
@paulparker77 I will remember your name Mr Parker and I will give you a shout in a years time maybe 2 and we will have a chat about Ings !!
@paulparker77 @_CallumMWright signing Ings is a no lose situation if lfc dont take this offer he WILL  go elsewhere and be a  big success
@_CallumMWright we have one in coutinho who is border line world class with more consistency that 200 million wasn't wisely spent
@_CallumMWright  the problem for me is you've got Chelsea United arsenal and city who have at least 4 world class players in there squad ...

Fav for Zlatan Ibrahimović 
@90thMin Iniesta hasn't assisted or scored for a long time ?? It's all about the pass before the assist
@JOE_co_uk @footiewankers @Brewers06
