Hi Friends! I'm just an awkward teenage boy stalking the bet, also, Tyler Oakley obsessed #tyleroakleytwittermeetup 
@tyleroakley why all of a sudden this promo. Lady Gaga is old news <CLOCK FACE FIVE OCLOCK> Like you Tyler. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
If someone famous follows you, don't take advantage of that and "sell" a group chat with them for RT's and Favs...
But like, how did 50 Shades of Grey even make it into theatres...
A lot of Troyler fans are very vicious which is another reason I hate the Troyler ship #whoops
@TronlerJFruit @photoshopsivan no comment
100% okay with this because I don't enjoy Troyler <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@photoshopsivan <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@boytroye_ Die in a hole.
@_TylersHair having fan accounts it would've sexists and discrimination so kindly leave if you don't like male fan accounts.
Just because someone said guys can't have fan accounts doesn't mean I'm going to stop mine, and if someone put a restriction on guys having,
@boytroye_ fite me bitch, auto correct is a dick.
My friends tell me I have inherited Tylers which cackle.
@oakleyobviously agreed
@oakleyobviously wtf, I swear if they spring a surprise convention
Taylor Swift isn't a queen, stop calling her that, it's very upsetting to a goddess like herself.
@oakleyobviously DO WE KNOW WHY YET
I have a thirst for Sam Smith, holy.
I love Vintage Cameras. Like yass boo. I swear if someone ever gets me an old Polaroid I would love them.

@tyleroakley @hailsivan it's a thing, I'm not just a crazy person.
@tyleroakley @hailsivan see, Tyler knows about thirst weekends
@tyleroakley How did I know you were going to post this? Oh, because you're predictable. 
It's the weekend. You know what that means <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>
Yet it's snowing. 
@TronnorsDildo How ever your little heart desires.
@TronnorsDildo Then you can't say someone is your Queen or King, just saying.
@tyleroakley is there a specific website where you get all your cool shirts? Or...?
@tyleroakley dm me, I enjoy your hair...because I am your hair.
I think you guys got a little side tracked, the #graceshow is on.
I don't understand why this Bruce Jenner thing is so big...accept it, or don't, and move on. Just don't spread hate, regardless of situation
Why is healthy stuff expensive though. Like salad costs way more than chicken nuggets.
My biggest concern is, Why do people care what others do with their lives. Aim for success in your life. Stay out of others.
When boys say "I smashed that girl" I think I'm going to puke all over every time.
@TylerAnarchy I think I would get extremely emotional.
@lightfranta If you gon' drag, you better tag, or else it's just useless hate. <TWO HEARTS>
@magicoakley I REALLY LOVE YOU AS A PERSON, you seem really awesome <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><TWO HEARTS>

Transgender identification is a tricky subject which is why I rarely tweet about it.
@reallyoakley Props to you using the correct gender identification.

@beanieOakley I Will miss you
@tyleroakley @ashlynnstewart_ that shirt looks like Tyler's hair
@oakleysparkle I don't understand.
@oakleysparkle I think you misspelled "Tyler"
@TylerAnarchy @tyleroakley Yeah.
@TylerAnarchy @tyleroakley Aw
@TylerAnarchy @tyleroakley yeah but I wish I wasn't this big <CONFUSED FACE>
@TylerAnarchy aw you sound so cute
@oakleythefirst @koreykuhl @tyleroakley What hair?
I guess it's time to start dieting...my @tyleroakley merch barely fits. <CONFUSED FACE>
@tyleroakley Your District Lines merch should come in bigger sizes <CONFUSED FACE>
Eeek! My @tyleroakley merch came!
@tyleroakley Been missing you this morning! <TWO HEARTS>
@oakley_overload and just because some people don't agree with our ways. That gives them no right to judge us.
Troye isn't allowed to drag his fans because 1. It's inappropriate. 2. He's suppose to be an idol. 3. He should provide a positive message.
Literally, Troyes actions could have very horrible consequences...
@oakleyftgaga Okay good! Because tensions are very high today.
@oakleyftgaga p.s I'm not trying to start and argument, I just wanted to voice my opinion. We've had enough fights in the fandom today. <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@oakleyftgaga Yeah, but I don't feel sorry for Troye...he snapped and it was very inappropriate.
@oakleyftgaga @oakleysparkle Tyler would never do that too his fans in the first place.
Tensions are too high for my liking today.
Wait...I think Troye should've left those posts up. He can't pretend like that didn't happen. Keeping them up would've held his word up.
My attention span is about as short as my pinky. I was over this Troye thing like 5 minutes after it started, pick your side, and stop.
@oakleysparkle living for the new layout
The fandom right now. 
Holy shit this fandom is up in flame.
@troyesivan *cough*
@parchedoakley Yeah but you would think he had learned how to cope with stress, and situations like this by now...
@parchedoakley Wait, but I completely agree. I don't think it was appropriate how he handled the situation
Good thing I've never shipped Troyler.
I hate when people try and shorten their sentences and go "hru" or "yea bc I was w/ dem" like no stop, type like a human, not a 80's teen.
@oakleysparkle I find this extremely pretty. 
@parchedoakley @tyleroakley You should buy it in my opinion, I was goin to buy it but didn't have the right phone model.
There are some states where it's legal to marry your first cousin, yet gay marriage isn't a complete thing yet.
@xTroylersBootyx
