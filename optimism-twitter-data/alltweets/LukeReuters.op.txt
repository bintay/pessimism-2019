If #Iran is to recognise #Israel as part of the nuclear deal, would Israel acknowledge that it's a nuclear state in return?

@nickschifrin Yes, but only equivalent to the hit it's economy has taken for past 3 years of sanctions during which no nuclear activity

On 1st day of new #Israeli parliament, one far-right party proposed a bill to annex West Bank, another to mandate death for terrorists
@IlyaFridman According to Jerusalem Post
@IlyaFridman Actually, it was Motti Yogev of the Jewish Home who proposed the annexation bill. Yisrael Beitenu just wants death penalty
The Palestinian take on why #Palestine is joining the International Criminal Court now: 
As #Palestine joins the ICC today, a look at the chances of a war crimes case being brought against #Israel 
On first day of new #Israeli parliament, Yisrael Beitenu party proposes bills to annex West Bank and mandate death penalty for terrorists
@multilateralist Palestine is not going to make any referral to the ICC today.
@multilateralist statutes than crimes of aggression statute. Also, impact of annexation on tourism a major issue, but is that a war crime?
@multilateralist Impact of settlements/occupation is critical to Palestinians' ICC strategy, agreed. But proof harder under war crimes 1/2
As #Palestine joins the International Criminal Court, day of reckoning with #Israel still a long way off:

Abbas rolls statehood dice with International Criminal Court move 
@paulhirschson True. No space for "membership". But then again, the stakes are indeed high, and no guarantee of a 'win'
To be frank, some of the reporting in the Israeli media on Palestine's ICC bid is poor, mainly because there is no input from Palestinians
Good blog from @glcarlstrom on @HerbKeinon's bizarre "exclusive": 
@HerbKeinon No, I'm still confused, and more alarmed by your failure to call the Palestinians for comment on your odd story
@EVKontorovich @HerbKeinon @AriSoffer1 And no line about "figures could not be independently confirmed". Clearly wasn't necessary ;)
@EVKontorovich @AriSoffer1 Funny thing is @HerbKeinon's own paper also used Gaza health officials as its source for the death toll
Odd that this @HerbKeinon story has no comment from the Palestinians, who would have denied it if he'd asked: 
@EVKontorovich @HerbKeinon Actually, the death toll from the Gaza war was confirmed by Israel - dispute was over number of civilians killed
Before you throw around misinformed criticism @HerbKeinon, please check your facts: 
@HerbKeinon Not accurate. We attributed all casualty counts to either Gaza health ministry or UN and said if Israel disputed the numbers
@AliAbunimah @AsafRonel Also denied by the Palestinians and not really up to Abbas to pause ICC steps at this stage

If you separate out #Israel's Arabs (20 pct) and religious community (15 pct), the remainder basically voted 55:45 for #Netanyahu
How #Netanyahu snatched a surprise #Israel election victory 
How "Bibi" clinched victory with a three-day rampage to attract right-wing votes: 
@NTarnopolsky @sheeraf Only opinion pollster that for it vaguely right all along was Geocartography, which says it used a different method
@MatthewKalman good luck
@MatthewKalman Think you've misunderstood. It's not voters that shifted to the right, it's Netanyahu who tacked that way to shore up support
@MatthewKalman What is true is that the centre and left slightly increased its share, from around 46 seats last time to 49 now
@MatthewKalman Exactly, so Netanyahu had to tack to the far-right to draw pro-settler and ultra-nationalist vote under his banner
@MatthewKalman Not that nonsense. Netanyahu successfully cannibalised the support of the far-right to ensure Likud came top
As #Europe wakes up, here's what happened: #Netanyahu wins surprise victory after sharp shift to the right 
A @haaretzcom chart of the #Israeli election after 99.5 pct of votes counted. Herzog has conceded defeat. 
#Netanyahu, fresh from victory, is headed to the Western Wall to pray. Nothing symbolic there. #IsraelElections
After shifting hard-right in three-day blitz, #Netanyahu secures surprise election victory:  
#Israel's election -- What you need to know: 
#EU and U.S. reaction to surprise #Israel election result is going to be critical in coming weeks/months. #BibiBoom 
#Netanyahu wins #Israel election after sharp shift to the right 
Zionist Union issues what amounts to a concession statement: "We thank from deep in our heart all those who believed in us and our way"
After reallocation of seats from those parties that did not make Knesset threshold, #Likud set for 31-24 victory over Zionist Union
#Netanyahu may be regretting that Rivlin  ended up becoming president. His view of government for a split nation may lean towards #Herzog
There's everything still to play for, but for now, #Netanyahu is playing it like he's in charge: 
So if #Netanyahu returns to power, here's the agenda he's promised: lots more settlement building, no Palestinian state, errr, that's it
The most accurate predictor of Israel's election may well have been this picture #IsraelElections 
Harder than #Netanyahu forming a coalition or #Herzog forming a coalition will be the president getting them to form a unity government
I'd love to know what's being muttered under the breath in the White House, and who is cracking champagne in  Congress #IsraElex
#Netanyahu's three-day cannibalisation of  the far-right vote helped him close the gap with Herzog while devouring his coalition options
As expected before the election, Kahlon is the kingmaker. With his support, Herzog can form a bigger coalition, but needs Arab list too
The net outcome of exit polls in #Israel's election is that #Netanyahu has effectively won but may not have partners for a coalition
Channel 2 gives Netanyahu a 28 to 27 lead over Herzog in Israel election exit poll
Joint Arab List looks like it might be third largest party in the Israeli Knesset
I'm betting there's only one seat in it, which leaves #Netanyahu better positioned to form a coalition, although Lieberman may be out
Totally unscientific synthesis of election rumour-mongering suggests it's v. tight between Zionist Union and Likud, a handful of seats
Key # in Israel election is 4: the gap over Likud that Zionist Union likely needs to form coalition 1st, and the threshold for Knesset entry
As Netanyahu rails about Arabs voting "in droves", there is no evidence and Arab party leader says not true: 
After sounding alarm about the 'Arab vote', Netanyahu's fate hangs in the balance:

This on Netanyahu's Facebook page: "Right-wing government is in danger. Arab voters voting in droves. Left-wing NGOs are bussing them in."
Now there are sonic booms going off in #Gaza, caused by #Israeli jets. Is there an electoral element to that? Gaza pretty quiet today.

Lapid sees Livni's decision to back out of rotation deal with Herzog as a sop to Orthodox parties, increasing odds of Bibi-Bougie coalition
A pre-election chat with Montreal radio: 
#Netanyahu promises there won't be a Palestinian state if he is re-elected: 
Netanyahu era 'coming to an end,' says former ally 
@jonathanglick @ishaantharoor No, see PT. He just wants to draw as much of the right-wing vote as possible to close gap with centre-left
Netanyahu's strategy is to cannibalize right-wing vote so his total closer to Zionist Union, then he may be invited to form coalition
#Netanyahu's last ditch election promises: more settlements on occupied land and no #Palestinian state. He's abandoned the centre vote
In his latest right-wing pledge before the election, #Netanyahu saysthat if he is re-elected a #Palestinian state will never be created. Wow
On eve of #Israel election, Netanyahu uses settlement backdrop to attract right-wing vote: 
As #Netanyahu admits settlements are a land grab, worth recalling this fine piece by @crispiandjb 
Former "Bibi" ally Yair Lapid declares 'Netanyahu era' all but over. 

#Netanyahu has just confirmed that settlements are a land grab designed to deny Palestinians access to Jerusalem. Amazing.
Bibi on Har Homa: "There was a Palestinian attempt to join Bethlehem, to break through to Jerusalem... we had to protect southern gateway"
Netanyahu proudly declares that building settlements like Har Homa was designed to cut #Bethlehem off from #Jerusalem. So it's true #EU
Business leaders see "peace boost" if Netanyahu loses #Israeli election 
@dannyctkemp @StevenErlanger @markmackinnon Are we sure it's really him?
.@markmackinnon I hear Moldova's president hasn't been seen for a few hours
Netanyahu era 'coming to an end,' says former ally 
After 9 years, #Netanyahu era coming to an end, says former ally Yair Lapid: 
@lrozen @AsafRonel @abasinfo Part of the sequencing over a nuclear deal as well as a quid pro quo for support against ISIS?
A sign Likud is truly getting desperate? Campaign calls urge people to vote, warn about "Hussein Obama": 
After #Israel election, priority must be to rebuild ties with U.S., former DC envoy says: 
Essence of #Israel election from Kahlon: "People don't leave #Israel out of fear of Hamas or Iran but because of high costs and no housing"
Has #Putin gone back to his canine disguise?  #WhereIsPutin 
As last opinion polls published ahead of #Israel's election, it's the centre-left's vote to lose: 
@tomstandage @popbitch Maybe their yuppie slightly old-Sloaney target readership likes a flutter
@tomstandage @popbitch I just assumed it was a sponsorship issue.
@sheeraf @talschneider @Gil_Hoffman @NTarnopolsky @AnshelPfeffer No, 2013 election was dominated by economy: 
#Israeli intel website DEBKA says report of Putin's death was briefly posted on Medvedev's website, though no proof: 
With one poll remaining, center-left rides solid lead into #Israeli election 
Toasting victory too early? Centre-left rides a solid lead into Israeli election 
Are "Bibi's" days numbered? Center-left rides solid lead into #Israel election 
#Netanyahu being interviewed on #Israel radio. Sounds like he has the worst cold ever. Are the polls getting him down? #IsraElex
Are these the faces of Israel's next prime ministers? @Tzipi_Livni #Herzog 
@talschneider @sheeraf @BuzzFeedNews It was clearly the day for the "women in Israeli politics" story:  
Very impressive "deep dive" by the @nytimes on Jewish settlements on occupied land in the West Bank: 
Could #Israel be on the brink of getting a new leader after six years of "Bibi"? 
Women gain influence across #Israel's political spectrum and are changing the tone and style of politics: 
@MatinaStevis @SpiegelPeter It's his birthday?! Now, what, 20 years from pension age? Doesn't look a day over 42-1/2.
#Israel's Herzog takes election momentum, haggling skills, to Tel Aviv market 
Kisses for opposition leader as he carries momentum into #Israeli election: 
While Herzog and Livni were all smiles in Tel Aviv market, stallholders said their vote was still with Netanyahu 
Herzog shows he can haggle. Getting ready for coalition negotiations? #IsraElex 
For nerds, a good breakdown of poll progression ahead of #Israeli elections. Centre-left consolidating a lead: 
@MatthewKalman Looks like a fake picture. Writing on the street and on the entrance to the building not Hebrew
While the centre-left could win #Israel's election, to govern it needs to form an ungainly coalition with Orthodox, far-right &amp; far-left
Polls are certainly consolidating around centre-left victory in #Israeli election. A third poll gives them three-seat lead over #Likud
Rather than inspiring people to vote for him, #Netanyahu uses scare tactics in this interview: 
@Berlaymonster @FT I want to read this but the 4G on my iPhone is not working
As Israeli election nears, peace earns barely a mention 
If you were hoping #Israel's election next week might improve the chance for peace with the Palestinians, think again 
What word has barely earned a mention in #Israel's election campaign? 
Once asked Chris Patten about the #EU army idea at a reception in 2001. His reply? "I get paid not to answer questions like that." 'Nuf said
Wow, Likud activist calls Barack Obama anti-Semitic then tries to take it back. Things have got low: 
#Netanyahu makes a surprise campaign appearance in Netanya -- hunting for the Russian vote as Lieberman slides? #ISRAELEX
In the post-match analysis, it may end up looking like #Netanyahu's Congress speech was a strategic error #ISRAELEX
@rosenthal_jon @joshmitnick Big enough to mean It would be difficult for Rivlin not to first ask Herzog to try to form a coalition
@mkoplow @lrozen He could even come close to missing his own threshold

@MeirJa Right. Which just makes it even harder to see how the arithmetic can work for the Zionist Camp, no?
@MeirJa And even then they would also need the religious parties and/or Lieberman and/or Kulanu to meet the threshold. Very tough.

@TeachESL since the speech or ahead of?
As #Netanyahu denounces Tehran, #Israel and #Iran are battling to resolve an old dispute over an oil joint venture 
I think it's hard for the #NetanyahuSpeech not to have given some boost to his March 17 election prospects
Wonder how many of the Democrat congressmen who decided to avoid/boycott the #NetanyahuSpeech are watching it on TV
The #Iranians must watch this and ask themselves "What the hell is going on?" #NetanyahuSpeech
Obama and White House will love this -- #NetanyahuSpeech is top trending hashtag on Twitter
@djpressman Nah, the speech has to be interrupted by standing ovations. This just an amuse bouche #NetanyahuSpeech
In his last speech to Congress in 2011, Netanyahu got 29 standing ovations. Anyone offering a spread this time around? 25? #NetanyahuSpeech
Boehner-Bibi Bromance? RT @glcarlstrom: Is this the US House Speaker's homepage, or Netanyahu's? 
@CNN has 8 (eight) correspondents and Wolf Blitzer handling the #NetanyahuSpeech to Congress. Seems more than a little overkill
If Netanyahu's Congress speech is not electoral, why is Likud party streaming it live 2 weeks before elections?:

@netanyahu: "My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office he holds. I have great respect for both."
At @AIPAC, @AmbassadorPower is laying out everything the U.S. has ever done to defend &amp; protect #Israel. Message is: trust us on #Iran

"The United States of America will not allow #Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Period," @AmbassadorPower tells @AIPAC
What's the whole issue with Netanyahu's speech to Congress? Here's an @ReutersTV explainer: 
@asafy @arabiaenquirer Yes of course. It took half a second though.
Totally agree with @lucykellaway about third party bragging on @Twitter, but alarmed by the grammar slip here: 
@Reuters will have an exclusive interview with President Obama tomorrow, ahead of PM Netanyahu's controversy-laced speech to Congress
As his flight leaves for Washington, #Netanyahu calls himself the emissary of the Jewish people. A bit like Moses? #TheSpeech
#Netanyahu clears his throat to address Congress: "Friends, Americans, countrymen..." Or probably not.

#Palestinians hold #Israeli government responsible for inciting Jewish attacks on a mosque and church in occupied W. Bank, E. Jerusalem
Bill O'Reilly wrote a novel about an unhinged network TV correspondent who covered Falklands war &amp; killed his bosses 
@lrozen Precisely. Which makes it hard to understand the logic. He's not making headway, it just looks damaging all over
Just about, although even some Republicans now uneasy “@noahbarkin: @LukeReuters he's still got the U.S. Congress on his side”
Netanyahu is sweating. Presumably P5+1 agrees on Iran nuclear approach. So Israel at odds with US, Britain, France, China, Russia &amp; Germany
Israel is undoubtedly threatened by Iran's nuclear ambitions. But aren't the Palestinians  too? A nuclear strike on such a small area?

Yes, he's not going to cancel RT @lrozen: @BarakRavid fwiw, the reuters report does not say cancel but changes to, @LukeReuters
@ChemiShalev Original here: 
@AsafRonel That would have been sensible. If he's got really sensitive intelligence on Iran that can sway Congress, it's the only way

Top issue for #Israelis in next election? Not peace or a two-state solution but the price of milk &amp; eggs:

@Jeffrey_Black no, tres drole
@Jeffrey_Black Was that sarcasm? We had to correct to say John Micklethwait!
@RobinWigg Once had dinner with John Micklethwait. Also intimidating in his own way but thankfully doesn't wear bow ties
Unconfirmed, but #Israeli SMS service says Shin Bet arrested American Christian with explosives who aimed to blow up #Muslim holy sites.
Hoping to head off the threat from Kahlon and other centrists, @netanyahu makes pre-election promise to cut prices: 
@xabueid Indeed, and while the #EU has responded, it's small beans. Gaza housing minister suggested 10s of millions, not more
Forget #Iran and rocket-fire from #Gaza. #Israelis are most worried about the price of eggs and cheese 
Remember the $5.4 billion pledged for #Gaza two months ago? Am told Arab states have not met any of their pledges. #EU the most responsive
#Israel's parliament formally dissolves itself ahead of March 17 election; #Netanyahu makes cost-of-living promises: 
Ah, Mr J Zed.  
Things you can get away with in #Brazil -- Judge misses flight, orders arrest of flight attendants: (h/t @jmsardo) 
#Israel's settlements may be hated, but more Palestinians are moving into them for cheaper housing, better services 
Turns out there are two knock-off @Starbucks in #Bethlehem. First one tells me he's the original. 
In 1948, #Bethlehem's population was 82 percent Christian. Today it is 22 percent, says the mayor, decrying impact of #Israel's occupation
The little known @Starbucks outlet in #Bethlehem. All luck to them 
Netanyahu's support is from die-hard Likudniks. They'll vote for anyone like him. To gain ground he has to offer more:
A course that teaches new grandparents how to behave. Ever-entrepreneurial America 
Britain's Lords won't accept cheaper #champagne to help cut taxpayer costs. You couldn't make it up 
Like in #TheGoodWife? “@DanWilliams: Israel's @NaftaliBennett says he &amp; @Netanyahu agreed not to attack each other in the March election"
@SpiegelPeter What, no kumquats in Brussels this winter? Quel horreur
It's a gorgeous 23 degrees in #Jerusalem and my kumquat tree is finally bearing fruit 
Reports of Palestinian President #Abbas suffering a stroke and being hospitalised are apparently false. Told he is "as strong as ever".
Fear that while this @Nigel_Farage outburst is unacceptable to most, it probably plays well to middle England: 
They're just eager to show how confident they are MT @alexstubb: In Parliament. Vote of confidence on the government, third in four weeks
Top issue for voters in last #Israelex in Jan 2013 was economics and cost-of-living. Since then, the #Gaza war: 
Israel's election will be fought over who can scare the voters more about security, rather than who can inspire them  #IsraElex
I'd love to know what the insurance premium is for the #ElginMarbles going to Russia. Holding on to them would be leverage for #Putin
Netanyahu's 6th grade teacher called him "friendly, disciplined, obedient". If only #Israeli politics were the same: 
#Israel's currency has lost 20 pct vs the dollar since July and politics is in turmoil, but it could be good 
Centre-left #Swedish government announces snap elections two months after coming to power. Will its recognition of #Palestine stand?
Having ditched Yair Lapid, @netanyahu looks to the right as #Israel heads to new elections: 
After almost nine years in power, is #Israel really ready for more "Bibi"? And the #Palestinians? @netanyahu 
A Jewish-Arab school in #Jerusalem holds to its mission despite deepening tensions in the divided city: 
"Bibi" Netanyahu, management consultant turned politician who likes order and security, but can he deliver? 
Never one to miss a trick, #Hamas lauds the collapse of the #Israeli government. Says it's "fruit of their victory" in the #Gaza war
#Israel set to hold new parliamentary elections on March 17 next year. The next three months could be rather turbulent
After 20 months in office, #Israel's @netanyahu fires two ministers and seeks early elections, probably next March: 
Not the usual image #Netanyahu offers up. Far from his no nonsense, I'm the man look. Nervous? 
@RobinWigg @SpiegelPeter @borzou Would that be bantam weight, cruiser weight or heavy weight?
A few reasons why new #Israeli elections are relevant: impact on #MidEast peace; damage to two-state solution; Iran; worse economic mess
"Firing of ministers is an act of cowardice and loss of control," says @netanyahu opponent Yair Lapid. It's gloves off in #Israel elections
Elections it is for #Israel. @netanyahu probably has support of ultra-Orthodox parties but surprises still possible: 
"Oh man, I forgot my narcs in the truck." Compelling story by @jameskanter about his neck-breaking biking accident: 
With new elections and a national strike on the cards, #Israel uneasy. Shekel has weakened

@Reuters is 2nd most popular Twitter feed among world leaders, but have to hand it to @SpiegelPeter, they like him: 
“@reuters With cement in short supply, #Gaza reconstruction could take over 30 years 
If @netanyahu has Shas and UTJ onside he can squeeze 61 seats IF he hasn't lost too much ground since last election and Bennett stays steady
Doubt @netanyahu would have started such a full-on fight with @YairLapid1 unless he already had Orthodox on side for a new coalition
Desperate for cement and bulldozers, Gazans face winter in ruins 
At the current rate of cement moving into #Gaza, it will take 30 years to rebuild the damage from the last war: 
Not quite Italy, but #Israel has managed 33 governments since its founding in 1948, and another could be on the way: 
So early elections now look firmly on the cards in #Israel. @netanyahu tells his coalition partners to stop undermining him, or else
@netanyahu is the longest-serving #Israeli PM since the first, David Ben-Gurion. But as his coalition unravels, will he hold on to power?

@EVKontorovich It's a Hobson's choice, which explains why 95 pct of Palestinians don't take it. This is worth a read:

"This is the most right-wing government in #Israeli history", and the impact is showing on two-state peace efforts:

Far-right Israeli MP backs bill that would limit the noise muezzins make from mosques -- "it's a severe problem Israelis have to deal with"
Palestinians succeed in getting discussion at UN Security Council on Israel's actions in East Jerusalem: 
@SpiegelPeter You nailed it in one. And there I was thinking I'd been subtle.
Prime Minister @netanyahu says criticism of #Israel makes peace more distant. So if U.S. and #EU stop criticising Israel, peace will come?
@StateDept spox calls US relationship with #Israel "formidable", which dictionary-wise means "inspiring fear, dread or alarm". Hmmm
Formidable a loaded word here - "Causing fear, apprehension or dread". Great basis for a relationship @APDiploWriter @statedeptspox

#Netanyahu agrees with Kerry that there are now opportunities with "parties in the Middle East" to carve out a "new reality"
#Netanyahu compares #Hamas to ISIS but then talks about it needing to "care for it's people" as if it were a normal administration
Netanyahu says thinks #Israel used justified and proportionate fire and weaponry against #Hamas in #Gaza
@Alex_d_Grosse Yes, in Hebron
As #Gaza war winds down, Israel announces arrest of Husam Kabsamma in Hebron, suspect behind killing of 3 Israeli boys and spark for the war
Took four days in #Israel before hearing my first #Gaza-fired rocket in Jerusalem, moments before the ceasefire began. May it hold
Arab turmoil makes Israel reckless and complacent - 
If #Israel says it will complete destruction of #Hamas tunnels within hours, did it come across a map showing it's got them all? #Gaza
How @Reuters reported the outbreak of World War One. It was England that first declared war on Germany: 
Underground with Israel's tunnel hunters: 
Could it get any worse? #freegaza campaign confuses fans who fear Paul Gascoigne is in trouble again 
@SpiegelPeter We never name out sources ;)
@SpiegelPeter Incursion, shmersion. Just can't stay away. Heard you were quoted as source by Bbg today. Spiegel IS the news!
Rather than complaining that #EU sanctions on #Russia are bad for EU business, perhaps company execs should urge Putin to alter behaviour
"I think this furniture needs reform, David" @NatashaBertaud: @JunckerEU meets with UK Prime Minister @David_Cameron 
Did @David_Cameron chew off @JunckerEU's left hand already? What friendly meeting? 
You guys are too kind. I'm here, waiting for you to tweet, but from what I hear, no deal on jobs tonight...? @SpiegelPeter @TonyAgotha
@AllieRenison Indeed not. An ex-Brussels hack. Will soon reappear in the Middle East. But doesn't mean I'm not intrigued by the summit
You have to wonder whether Germany's #WorldCup2014 victory might make #Merkel more amenable in #EU top jobs battle. Surprises possible?
@MiguelAEGEE @jmsardo 
If #Ashton's nomination as #UK commissioner was out of left field five years ago, Lord Hill's nomination is decidedly out of right field
Or they're going to put up a little statue of you, naked and urinating @SpiegelPeter @TrendsBelgium @ECspokesKoen
Some free #EU top job guesses: Thorning-Schmidt Council president; Mogherini asylum/migration/aid and Commission VP; Sikorski high rep #euco
Now #Merkel can resign and take a job as Queen of Europe, safe in the knowledge Germany is on top in most things #WorldCup2014
Or the pay is crap but at least you get to talk to the really fascinating people in financial markets @SpiegelPeter @Pawelmorski
@b_judah You might want to update your Bru gossip network. Lots of ways it could be a man from centre-right if Council president is a woman
So leaving Belgium is real: movers have finished packing. This EU hack signing off and will reemerge in the Middle East soon. A bientot
The scene as @JunckerEU meets UKIP's @Nigel_Farage. Not for real, apparently 
560,000 pounds ($960,000) to add 's' to an Internet address 
If you had $100 on it, would you bet against Federer winning the fifth to take an eighth Wimbledon championship? #goat
@matteorenzi may not have carried out reforms yet, but his style is definitely a breath of fresh air. Quick with a joke and molto sciolto
Renzi: Not the responsibility of Bundesbank to engage in a debate about what's going on in Italy. Right back at you Weidmann #IT2014EU
Now let's see what Renzi says RT @YanniKouts: Berlin says "no difference" with Rome on #EU budget rules 
So @BarrosoEU apparently spent his honeymoon in Italy, in Florence and then driving to Naples via Rome. Who knew. #IT2014EU
Renzi says "if Italy becomes simpler, it becomes stronger", as he promises raft of reforms #IT2014EU
Renzi says determined to put Italian "energy and passion" into Italy's presidency of the EU for next six months #IT2014EU
Is Europe's troubled union really ready to change? 
After 60 years, has EU integration reached a high point, with Britain leading charge against "ever closer union"? 
Morning thoughts on the news day from @Reuters EMEA editor @MikePReuters RT: Ukraine clock ticking.
