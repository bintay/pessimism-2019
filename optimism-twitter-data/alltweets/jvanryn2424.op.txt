I called game
@Erich_ryan fair point. #respect
@EJSantarpio @Erich_ryan not a big ham guy sorry Johnny - traditional for me. Bread butter and cheese
@Erich_ryan keep that tomato crap away from that pristine sandwich.... Only way to make it better is to go &gt;1 cheese...
Let's go @WillKelleher235 !!!! Welcome to the #NE10 my man  
@Erich_ryan so so true
My local paper the voice of reason???!!! How about that!  
Congrats to my guys @MBoen5 and @WillKelleher235 for qualifying for the tourney today.... Good stuff. #WeAre
Love Brady (Michigan Man) but how funny would it be if Jimmy G was lights out for a month and took TB's job (a la Bledsoe....)
@MaxBoen started at Stanford. People say he'll start in secondary immediately .... Let's go!
@RockSteadyRD3 @GManko33 agreed - but Blatt SHOULD know better .....
Battle verbals
Staffers meet with Nike
FB announces transfer from Stanford (who can play) 
Best day for UM since Final Four win over Cuse?!
Won't finish there but not sure I ever thought I would see the day....  
What a day for the beloved Wolverines!!!! Kace was so excited he put some of his new UM gear on! 
@GManko33 I actually agree with you here Gregory. Man you must be learning something in college! #proud
Let's do this - it MATTERS to recruits....  
I know we're a real program now because we're cheating!!! #ifyouaintcheating 
@gregroyce it's no 46-2 .... Lol
@gregroyce hopeful, optimistic, thrilled it worked out
@gregroyce nice job today my man.... What. A. Day.
@NE10_Commish I see what you did there..... <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But he's not clutch I thought..... Weird  
Happy Mother's Day to my wonderful wife @amydvorah 
Only game winner I ever hit came in a summer league game and it was a bank shot from dead-on. Feeling more and more like DRose and Pierce
@westpointtom congrats on the G1 w Twilight my man. Happy for you-
My man @cityrocksEYBL getting some well-deserved love.  
Ummmmm..... #Scenesfrom95 
Who's this joker in the khakis ....  
In other words - Simmons asked for WAY too much money and ESPN said we love you but not that much....  
@bryanhillabc officially - big time!
@bryanhillabc only because of your quality photography!!
Let's go @kingofthehill85 !!!! #Proud #Better #SoManyCleats 
@bryanhillabc @football14_mhs that is TREMENDOUS.
@ryoneil97 good for you my man.... And it's not UMass Amherst - it's Mansfield West! Seriously congrats - I'm thrilled for you
@ryoneil97 thanks my man - did you decide where you're going next year?
@ryoneil97 that is tremendous - hope you're well my man
@tjfarrell9 Kettle... you're black! Haha - and not true, I still have more (not by much!)
#Truth 
@H0geyBear @Jvg1321 I remember that - agreed that trumps this. Gotta say Hoge you're big time!
@Jvg1321 @H0geyBear TREMENDOUS ANSWER although his dad is still the coolest member of the family (until he can talk and yell at refs....)
@Jvg1321 @H0geyBear JG - where does this rank right now among your life's greatest moments! #BigTime
Looks like we're getting the 'I'm going to score 45 or so tonight' LeBron. Love this guy
@EJSantarpio I would never compare Brady to Bonds... that's silly talk right there Johnny
Just looking ahead-
11/24 &amp; 2/9 - Merrimack plays Stonehill 
@MBoen5 vs. @RyanBoulter21
2 of the best young men I've ever worked with
@_JavionOG congrats on the news - Now I can come see you play a ton!!
@WillKelleher235 CONGRATS on the good news. So happy for you my man
And Kace is officially 1-0 at Mansfield sporting events! Well done @MBoen5 and @WillKelleher235 #WeAre  
So excited for the man, the myth, the legend @kingofthehill85 on his opportunity! Let's go!!!!! 
A huge congratulations to two of my favorite people @ShaneBurnison and @BridgetBowes22 on the big news! #KacesNewGF
@goldberg_4 no way he's that good.... Bench energy defensive guy not a key member of a title team.
@CoachDeSalvo that's truly amazing. I'm beyond jealous lol
@goldberg_4 let's define productive .... Somewhere between Daniel Orton and Anthony Davis???
@Giggs07 its May 4th!!!! We've still got another month!
@goldberg_4 and that's why he'll be out of the league in 3/4 years....
@CoachDeSalvo thanks my man... All good here. He's doing well. And as you know too well, sleep is overrated!! Hope you're well
Thoughts @goldberg_4 ?? #Clown 
@Stephen_Douglas fat Amy?? Please tell me it was fat Amy!!
@goldberg_4 see if it is indeed 'most valuable' I agree... Without Davis that team is awful
@Erich_ryan fair fair points and the WAR fact was interesting. I'm a big 'if you're starting a franchise and you have first pick....' Guy
@Erich_ryan who would you rather have on your team
2014-15: 
LeBron: 25.3PPG | 6.0RPG | 7.4APG 
Steph: 23.8PPG | 4.3RPG | 7.7APG
Just sayin....
@goldberg_4 @Jvg1321 @phil_vigeant I don't know what a 'complete dunk on' means. Either he got you or he didn't.... Phil, @ehrlichmatt7 ??
@goldberg_4 @Jvg1321 @phil_vigeant and all because YOU got dunked on apparently .... #BeBetter
@Jvg1321 @phil_vigeant @goldberg_4 no way he competed against @MBoen5 .... No clue why but he did!
@Jvg1321 @phil_vigeant @goldberg_4 I will say this - Phil tried as hard as he could defensively guarding @MBoen5 and did a decent job
@goldberg_4 @phil_vigeant sorry Phil this took a strange turn on you lol. My bad
@phil_vigeant @goldberg_4 I'm sure you did a sensational job of forcing the dribbler high too right Phil? #IveSeenYouDefend
@goldberg_4 @phil_vigeant only way he gets on is if he flops when someone beats him off the bounce (very possible)
@phil_vigeant @goldberg_4 I could say maybe you could have stood in there and taken a charge but I know better....
@goldberg_4 @phil_vigeant Phil - he probably has a very good point here....
@phil_vigeant @goldberg_4 oh no - say it ain't so Goldy!
@gregroyce @Bradley_Davis14 I'm a big 'on the road' guy. Don't worry about anything but playing, winning, and where you're eating....
@Bradley_Davis14 I recognize I'm a little different but I don't think it's a bad thing to be on the road for things like this....
@Bradley_Davis14 just glad you guys got in.... Been some tough 'last one outs' the last couple of years
In other news - if I could afford it and didn't have a newborn at home, so would I ... 
Blake Griffin will never win a title
@gregroyce nooooooooooo .... Today was a great derby day
@CoachChrisKraus congrats my man - thrilled for you
Is this a prize or a punishment??? @RobertLeePXP @THuerter

@nickblahday negative my friend. At men's lax today.
@Stephen_Douglas what can I say I'm kind of a big deal
@gregroyce too much excitement over SNH SB in NE10 semis??!!
@RockSteadyRD3 assume you saw Stauskas retweeted it - hope you're good my man and hope to see you soon
@theJoshBanks YES!!! My favorite character on the Cosby show! Kid delivered every single time
And this was the point at which @amydvorah officially became better at Twitter than I am ... 
@GManko33 best photo of him yet - by far.....
Thanks to future #NFL star @kingofthehill85 &amp; @carlenekluge (very good tweeter) Kace's wardrobe got a solid addition 
@alxgallant it's close but considering its Merrimack v Adelphi.... I'll agree with you !
@alxgallant look at you miss big time! That's awesome
@alxgallant where's the pic??? I want to see
@mghika personally mine is him trading down to get more secondary guys from Rutgers that can‚Äôt play!
First day back in gym in like 3 weeks - Felt like I ran a marathon in my 30 min on treadmill! #Fat #BlameKace
@amydvorah his 'manliness' tempered a little bit by the chicks that he's wearing!
Can't even begin to wrap my head around how silly this is .....

@dmk1122 totally agree. All time hashtag there my man. Hope you're well my friend
@BallAboveAll12 thank you so much my man - hope you're doing well and things are good
@aicathletics extremely kind of you.... Appreciate the nice words. Baseball sounds good to me next week
You can tell how tired my wife is if she's saying things like this about me!  
@aanechiarico thank you so much - hope to see you guys soon!
@EJSantarpio haha well played good sir.
So Calipari gets back-to-back top-ranked recruiting classes and he's cheating / paying kids. K does it and it's bc he's a great coach #Hmmmm
When I left today Kace's head was still on straight... I'm a little concerned about his day care situation! 
Hard to leave my little guy today for first time but know he's in great hands #Mom @amydvorah 
@MattKaplowitz it's like a weird daze I'm in and then I hold my guy Kace and its all worth it
@GManko33 understood - congrats on the season
Heyyyyyooooooo !!!! Don't forget to tip your bartender everyone!  
Safe to say if you‚Äôre recording an avalanche as its happening, you‚Äôre a tad bit more manly than I am! #RUN
If Love really thinks Olynyk did that intentionally, I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath about him considering Boston, C‚Äôs fans #LakerToBe
@caliano7 takes a lot of grit and heart to be a low seed in the playoffs when at least 10 of the team‚Äôs tank every year!
@GManko33 woah Gregory the language‚Ä¶ my ears. Jeez
At half??!!!  
@Coach_Treff pains me to say being a huge Michigan fan but you're 100% right. Hope all is well
BIG Congrats to @ShaneBurnison and @BridgetBowes22 as they enter into marital bliss today!
Kace's wardrobe got an awesome addition today! #GoBlue @umichbball 
Happy bday to the queen of Indianapolis @eloomer - truly one of the best people I know. Hope it's a great one!
Hey that's me!  
Coffee with a straw- Leg-En-DARY!!! 
@WIZdom31 totally agree - if they give it to harden‚Ä¶.
Our nurse just used the term 'necessarily necessary'!! I found it justifiably justified
@DiCenzoRyan hard to argue with you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a huge MJ guy but hard to argue with the results
@GManko33 my bad‚Ä¶. #CeltsIn7
@DiCenzoRyan maybe but he gets there every year and there‚Äôs something to be said for that‚Ä¶.
@nferraz14 that‚Äôs a good tweet Nicholas
@DiCenzoRyan agreed there‚Ä¶ would have been fun to see. Unfortunately this is the way the whole league is now #Harden
@DiCenzoRyan I respect your sports thoughts / arguments but this is your worst‚Ä¶ MJ, Bird, etc were legendary talkers
@GManko33 good news‚Ä¶ they finished 2nd Gregory!
@DiCenzoRyan by biggest stiff you mean ‚Äòbest player‚Äô I assume?
Who's this James guy on Cleveland?? He seems to be pretty good

No contract signed between Mayweather &amp; Pacquiao, no tickets sold and this fight is supposed to take place a week from this Saturday #Hmmmm
@JakeTryder9 interesting group of folks favoriting your tweet here.....
@JakeTryder9 I think he and Zeller should be the only two that are allowed to shoot (maybe Smart every now and again). IT is fun to watch
@JakeTryder9  you know me so well my man‚Ä¶Understand your pain but you have to watch those crafty burrito creators!
@JakeTryder9 didn‚Äôt you watch them make it?
@NECralph 5 of 6 on road??!! Yikes - that‚Äôs not something we would do an NE10 team!!
@ehrlich_mike @MaxBoen his best friend LGB can come as well....
This Cavs-Celts series is like watching a cat play with a mouse #CeltsAreNotTheCat
@ehrlich_mike @MaxBoen my bad - LGB's 14 carries for 40 yards was the difference in the super bowl!! Not a man named Brady #2ndGoat
@MaxBoen you're right Maxie - he's amazing. That's why he gets released every year
@DiCenzoRyan that's a fair point.... Love the conspiracy theorists!
@DiCenzoRyan wouldn‚Äôt he have more titles ‚Ä¶.. #BeBetter
@MaxBoen who's your number one back???? LGB?? How will you overcome that loss?
@ryan_otto11 you‚Äôre already getting smarter with age!
Nice of the NFL to hook the locals up by scheduling the Pats / Steelers game during Leveon‚Äôs suspension #KraftEffect #GoodellsPuppetMaster
Happy bday to my guy @ryan_otto11 - looking forward to working with him in the next few years. Dude gives 100% every second he‚Äôs on court

@Bintroini2 ‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù obviously right around the corner and the ole ‚Äúok we‚Äôll both hang up on three‚Äù clearly in play!
@GManko33 so let me get this straight, you were winless and still made the playoffs??
In regards to our new son....

Apparently not RT @ryenarussillo: Are we days away from asking, ‚ÄúWill an NFL team sign Aaron Hernandez?‚Äù
@BFlinnHoops the Maciarello connection!!
Local news talking about 'closure' for the Patriots and how they can 'move forward' now following Hernandez verdict -didn't they win the SB?
Long story but one of the funnier things about our hospital stay has been that I've been called Mr. Resnick for the majority of it
@philladandy thanks my man. Truly appreciate it
@BBouck yes there is - YOU, that‚Äôs who!!
@tjfarrell9 thanks my man - some stressful times but we‚Äôre hoping the worst is behind him
For some reason I sort of feel badly for Aaron Hernandez's fianc√©, or as she's better known - Ashanti

@BHallESPN good luck haha. Hope you‚Äôre well my man
@BHallESPN I‚Äôll take Kerr and give you the field for a cold one at some point
@BHallESPN great call as well and I totally totally agree with the 10 years ago thought. Truly amazing. We all know Kerr is winning it
@BHallESPN don‚Äôt disagree with you but not sure how much credit he gets with about 10 teams not trying and the C‚Äôs being 7 or 8 seed‚Ä¶
@GManko33 thanks man - we‚Äôre fired up beyond belief
@GManko33 that was a great call (blind faith but still counts) - just waiting for the little dude now
@GManko33 I love your optimism and I'm genuinely happy for you as you called this VERY early on. You want Atlanta ...
Happy for all the C‚Äôs fans,  but don‚Äôt forget the worst place to be in the NBA is ‚Äòthe middle‚Äô which is where you currently are
To say my hospital 'bed' is less than comfortable would be an understatement. To paraphrase the Beastie Boys 'No Sleep Till Baby' #BabyWatch

But do they get to hang out with people like Johnny Linen on the bench? No! Advantage me
@EJSantarpio definitely up there no doubt but doesn‚Äôt beat out volunteer 3rd asst coach!

Sounds like Day 2 of BabyWatch shaping up similarly to Day 1. Bad -probably no baby today. 
Good -our walking tour of Boston will continue
Back at the hospital for Day Two - let the fun begin!
@maurhoney truly honored....
@mghika days not over!!
And approximately 11 hours later we are leaving hospital. Good day all in all, still no baby #Tomorrow
Woman at hospital within earshot puking like I've never heard a woman being sick before. #Yuk #WhatsForDinner #CouldBeWorseAmy
@eloomer thank you - Amy is ready to have baby but he doesn't want to come out. Hope you're doing well. Nice new avi!
Pregnant lady just did math - estimate is that we walked approximately 5.5 miles today #Cardio #10MosPregnant
Hospital update: 
Wife asleep 
Husband not
@nickLantz10 lets go!! Want a pic of the new pad when all is set up #CommuteCutInHalf
Congrats to all the good folks with the @cityrocksEYBL on the huge weekend down at Boo! Well done!
And we're back at the hospital! Hoping for 2nd dose and then probably to head home for night. #BabyWatch
Update: We were just kicked out of the hospital because Amy is having too many contractions #Irony
The graph on the right -&gt; Contractions
The lines on the left -&gt; Baby's Heartbeat #TechnologyIsAmazing 
On a 3-hour break before we head back to hospital for next round of drugs. Having lunch in Boston. #GoodDeliverySoFar
Congrats to all my guys that were recognized - good stuff. #Proud 
@ttess24 thank you. We think it'll happen tomorrow but the 'cervical ripening' is happening today
This might be the harshest tweet ever by a huge corporation.... Jeez ESPN have some sympathy for the young man... 
Shockingly, I actually agree with this....  
@aanechiarico I've said it more on the last four weeks than I have in the rest of my life combined. That's for sure! Thank you
@aanechiarico it is. Today is the 'cervical ripening'. We don't think he's coming today.
First part of the induction process is underway - let the fun begin! #HeartBeat 
Happy bday shoutout to the best asst commissioner in all of D3 @mghika !
The final ten min of that game are why sports are the absolute best and also the absolute worst #FrozenFour
Reminder ..... 
@GManko33 the last one is absurd ‚Ä¶..
I watch 1 college hockey game a year and I feel AWFUL for the BU goalie. #Alumn
@GManko33 looks just like you Gregory
Happy anniversary to my beautiful wife @amydvorah - An amazing first year with you and here's to many many more 
Love the people complaining about how long baseball games are and then staying up to watch a 19-inning game in April.
ONLY person in league to play defense!! RT @DLeagueWarriors: .@ACraft4 IS THE 2015 NBA DLEAGUE DEFENSIVE POY! 
@philladandy I just don't think he's an NBA-level player. He's a PG in the league.... Don't see it. Any day now - fired up !
@philladandy that, and the fact he can‚Äôt play in the league‚Ä¶. Sorry to say. Root for guys I coached against. Hope u and family are well
No idea what a trap queen is but that's my jam #fire
@RockSteadyRD3 Have no issue with Steph getting it - best player on best team. Dont think it should be Harden at all
@RockSteadyRD3 Without Curry the Warriors are still very good - we saw what the Cavs were last year without LBJ. It's 'Most Valuable' right?
@RockSteadyRD3 His name is James, Lebron James.....
@phil_vigeant totally fair point.... Still a better hockey school than hoops school #sadbuttrue
@phil_vigeant you won as many tournament games as Michigan and we were not good! #truthhurts
@carlenekluge I said nothing about the women‚Äôs program! #legend
Providence = Hockey School 
Providence does not = Basketball School
@_ChrisBradley like the concept of the banquet, night in town. Make it more of an experience for the student-athletes
Like this concept RT @MassLiveHS: BREAKING - MIAA state basketball finals may come to Springfield in 2016 - MassLive 
Woah- that escalated quickly‚Ä¶ RT @GoodmanESPN: Bobby Hurley is the new coach at Arizona State, multiple industry sources told ESPN.
Happy birthday the only future NFL player I know personally @kingofthehill85 - hope it's a good one.
@caliano7 #YouAre
@caliano7 @Bradley_Davis14 you boys take care of my guy MT @RyanBoulter21: I'm proud to announce that I have committed to play at Merrimack
@mghika noooooooooo the Patriots aren‚Äôt on!!!!! Lolz

*gimme that duke starting 5* 
@Bintroini2 joins Mansfield v Franklin freshman games as ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô on the schedule! Let‚Äôs goooooo
TMLT - selfishly I couldn‚Äôt be happier that Bo and Bolts are going to be playing in my lge and I‚Äôll see them a ton @MBoen5 &amp; @RyanBoulter21
Can not express how happy and proud I am of my guy @RyanBoulter21 on the news today
@aaronsagraves26 very true although he probably should have gone!! Haha hope you're well my man
Grayson Allen declaring his intention to return to Duke is a real thing??!! Dude was DNP-Coaches Decision in about half their games!
Why do both UConn and ND have like ten people on their benches in suits and dresses? What are these NFL coaching staffs?
@bubbaprog totally agree‚Ä¶. Feel like I‚Äôm watching SemiPro or something! PBP guy is laughably bad!
Lol #DukeRules 
So Bo &amp; the Badgers are complaining about the 16-3 FT att discrepancy in the 2nd half. Guess they haven't watched Duke play over the years?
Random Thought: I think Coach K's experience on that stage was a HUGE factor in the outcome of the title game. Excuse me while I go throw up
Late with this, but a solid B+ for last night's 'One Shining Moment' - otherwise known as the best 3 minutes of TV all year long.
Thrilled our little guy hasn‚Äôt arrived yet as I didn‚Äôt want his first championship ‚Äòwitnessed‚Äô to be won by Duke!
@RobertLeePXP until the opening game of the 2015-16 season‚Ä¶.
@RockSteadyRD3 agreed rocky.
Tyus Jones just declared himself eligible for the Draft
How do you get that call wrong with the benefit of replay
@EJSantarpio good debate no doubt. Love both. Okafors perceived lack of athleticism and awful defense will be stories before draft
@EJSantarpio was going to be before tonight my man
2nd half foul count: 
Wisconsin - 10 | Duke - 5
Lololol
I enjoy Mrs Kaminsky‚Äôs eye makeup
First time I've ever seen Duke get a bad whistle. #PigsFlying #HellFreezing
@GManko33 no need because im usually right
@GManko33 everyone that will see court tonight will be a scholarship player
@GManko33 aside from that scholarship Greg
AWESOME opening montage to National Title game. Well done CBS
Sure hope I get the former Duke player perspective tonight‚Ä¶. 
GHill

#Overkill
Find it really entertaining that a guy who's had to vacate wins and titles everywhere he's been (Cal) will be inducted into HOF this year
Forgot how annoying the baseball season was on Twitter #SadFace
@gregroyce At least he's in the lineup no? Haha
I think they should start forcing the UConn women‚Äôs team to spot the other team points. This is absurd.
Love the fact that they interview coaches during the game and players at half of the Women‚Äôs Final Four
@mghika all the more reason to watch women‚Äôs basketball!
@nickLantz10 look at you there big time!!
We have our own Dirk!! #GoBlue RT @umhoops: Moritz Wagner just committed to Michigan. 
Happy Jeester to all!
Cal = Best recruiter 
Cal does not = Best coach
@nickblahday but you‚Äôd much rather be playing them ‚Ä¶.
@nickblahday congrats my man. Exciting to be playing on Monday night
Who‚Äôs happier right now - that undefeated Indiana team or Duke? #SeriousQuestion
@MaxBoen turned into wanting to see history made‚Ä¶ you get to be my age it‚Äôs hard to remember who wins every year. I wouldn‚Äôt forget 40-0
@MaxBoen well played Maxie‚Ä¶. well played. Not even mad at you for that #Proud
@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 that makes me sad too
Bo Ryan didn‚Äôt know Duke won the first game??? Wow!!! #ThePatsWonTheSuperBowlBo
Actually a shame that UK is going to lose - won‚Äôt remember Duke v Wisc in ten years, would have remembered 40-0 #OldMan
#QualityOfficiating
@caliano7 thank god this guy doesn‚Äôt know me!! #ThenThan
@aaronsagraves26 I‚Äôm totally with you ‚Ä¶.
Love Okafor but Towns is a better pro
Stay classy MT @slmandel: Outside Duke locker room, Okafor's dad and uncle Chiding AP voters for only giving him 5 votes for POY.
If WCS is the best defender in the country, how come he isn‚Äôt shadowing Kaminsky? @goldberg_4
@caliano7 FIRE
Duke in the bonus with 10:34 left in 2nd half.....
Duke in the bonus with 9:12 left in 1st half. Good times.....
Good god, could these three be rooting any harder for Duke? Gag me already..... Where did Grant Hill go to school again?
What the hell is the point of this thing in the top corner of the screen? I know what the logos are and don't care 
Why is Nantz screaming about every made basket in the first 4 min of this game?
Respect the Oak Hill Asst Coach wearing the sweater vest. #GoodLook
Can truly say this is the first time in my life I‚Äôve been excited about a Spring Game @umichfootball #HarbaughEffect #GoBlue
@SienaSaints @tjfarrell9 @SienaBaseball @CornellSports Kudos to all who helped make this happen -
@CoachDeSalvo It's awesome - truly the best part about what we do in college sports in my opinion. Hope you're well my man
@aanechiarico Thanks, great night. Hope you guys are good!
Extremely proud of the work my wife does @GoTeamIMPACT Great to be a part of this year's Gala #39WeeksPregnant 
Shaka is an A+ hire for Texas. Longhorns will be a top-10 program year in and year out

Geno Auriemma vs. Dick Vitale arguing over college basketball sounds like the blowhard debate of the Century #Myegosbigger #Nomineis #killme

@ben_beaury_ man that Beaury family knows how to travel! Enjoy the weekend - send my best to the old man!
@NECralph "Representing" their constituents..... hahaha.  What a joke!
@Joe_Krong So obviously you're flying to Fla!! haha - why not! All good here, wife is due a week from today - crazy!
@Joe_Krong Man! How tough is your life!! Haha... hope all is well my man
Congrats to Tennessee basketball for being as talented as any team in the country, but underachieving every year! #Barnes
@GeorgetownMet AWESOME. Where we got married last April. Enjoy it - One of my favorite places in the world. Say hello to the Holiday Inn
Hey @huggies do you know something I don‚Äôt? @amydvorah 
Hulk Hogan is speaking at Maryland‚Äôs graduation ceremony this spring. Hard to judge when Bill Cosby spoke at yours #TrueStory #HugsForDays
@theJoshBanks look at you there Bob Vila!! (Sp??)
@Bradley_Davis14 @7News booooooooooooooo #RentalCash
@theJoshBanks probably true
3 members of the Alabama football team have been arrested in the past 4 days. At what point is it too much to be successful?
@GeorgetownMet awesome part of the country - enjoy the trip
@EJSantarpio LOL. 9-foot rims for women‚Äôs/ girls game!!! Why not!
If I could do it without being mean, I would tweet about the girl in the HS dunk contest.....
It‚Äôs March 30th- stop it already!! RT @NWSBoston: Next chance for Snow? Low risk for some wet snow Tuesday night 
You will laugh guaranteed- if not you get your $$ back! RT @catesish: Dog Vine is the only part of Vine I care about. 
Proud of my guy @_JavionOG as he embarks on the next chapter in his life
So Willie Cauley-Stein is a First Team All-American but is the 2nd-best player on his team?? Got it.
@theJoshBanks Is this good news or bad? #ZZZZZZZZZ
More accolades for my guys @RyanBoulter21 and @MBoen5 #WellDeserved |  
@LadE_Baldwin Good for you! Congratulations - we'll be neighbors!!!
@eloomer yeah yeah‚Ä¶. Fair argument. Still has to do those things (they‚Äôre the reason he makes millions to coach!)
@nickLantz10 his lack of elite athleticism scares me a little bit. Good debate ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll probably hear some about it over next three mos.
@caliano7 #Dontbetonit
@eloomer you mean a curmudgeon who refuses to do halftime interviews with the media until it‚Äôs mandated by CBS ;)
@EJSantarpio and the third member of the crew went to Duke!!
@nickLantz10 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as clear as you think‚Ä¶. KAT in the mix big time‚Ä¶.
@CoachAmundson congrats on the new gig. Really happy for you but gonna miss you my friend
Thrilled to hear the good news surrounding my guy @RyanBoulter21 - hasn‚Äôt been an easy road, thrilled he‚Äôs getting the attention he deserves
@aaronsagraves26 that‚Äôs funny - well played good sir
Idk about anyone else but I'm really looking forward to this broadcasting team running on the court to celebrate w Duke after the game!
@Giggs07 Thats a safe bet! lol
"Duke likes to go on a run to end the half" - Grant Hill 
Yes, GH, they're the only team that likes to do that.... good analysis friend
'Assistant Video Manager' - you're kidding right Gonzaga.... Kudos to you Adam Morrison
@DanWolken Why not Masiello there?
On record right now, Chris Mullin will NOT be successful @StJohnsBBall
Dear every student-athlete that will ever play against Duke, 
Justice Winslow wants to go left.
Sincerely, Me
Please, I beg of you ,graphics people, stop using the 'hasn't made a FG in X amount of time' 
IT'S MEANINGLESS

@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 @MaxBoen @PCAthletics Gonna be waiting a long time #PCDoesntPayEnough
@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 @MaxBoen not a bandwagon fan at all. Want to see history made... Why not!! #GoCats
@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 @MaxBoen I'm owning it. We'll be telling our grand kids about how Cal bought a team that went 40-0!!
@LadE_Baldwin what are you doing?? Congrats
@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 @MaxBoen I'm with Goldy now. Rooting to see history and a 40-0 season. Hard to root for UK ($$) but they beat wisc
@nickLantz10 perfect shot for when you run for mayor of some small town !
@gregroyce totally totally agree. Unacceptable at any level with a shot clock
Not a big Mike Brey guy - Tonight 
Scouting / Preparation - A+ 
In-game management - C/C- (no plays late, no 2for1, no adjustment on Towns)
@gregroyce true‚Ä¶ and very well said
@javy981 better than usual lol
@nickLantz10 sweet new Avi! Because I‚Äôm proud to be an American where at least I know I‚Äôm free!
@LadE_Baldwin wait, what‚Ä¶ why??
We can all agree that if you asked Pat Connaughton, he‚Äôd still say that @kingofthehill85 is the best player he‚Äôs ever played against
@MaxBoen @goldberg_4 go to bed Maxie, you‚Äôre obviously delirious
@goldberg_4 that‚Äôs why UK wins I think by 8-10‚Ä¶. Although Bo won‚Äôt let him get easy touches like ND did
@goldberg_4 they'll try to dictate tempo and want the game in the 60s.... But UK is way too athletic for them
@goldberg_4 @ehrlich_mike can't let him touch it!! Only possession tjei fronted Harrison dribbled out of bounce on end line
@goldberg_4 @ehrlich_mike totally agree he's big time #FrontThePost #WCSMIA
When a teammate interrupts an interview to hug his teammate (and knows he's on TV), it drives me insane. #AaronHarrison
I'd like to thank this TBS crew for not forcing us to see Ashley Judd about a hundred times during this broadcast tonight
@goldberg_4 @ehrlich_mike haha I'm sure you do... Sorry my man.
So how we doing here @goldberg_4 ? About time for WCS to take over right? #YoureBetterOffensively
Enjoying how kids can just hang on the rim like its practice in this Kentucky / ND game
@alxgallant totally totally agree. I'm a curse in No. Andover !
@PeteIorizzo I'm already looking forward to the day when the UConn empire crumbles and teams beat them like this ....
The UConn women's team shooting 3's leading 97-50 with 4 min left is just so.... UConn women's basketball #WinWithClass
At some point tonight Utah is going to realize that Winslow is a lefty right??? Come on clowns #ScoutingReport
I don't know anything about it at all but if I'm St. John's I'm giving Masiello a long look for that job
Congrats to my guy @Erich_ryan on his choice of school. Great kid, great attitude #Winner #PowerMove
If you think Hernandez's fianc√© is providing some game-changing testimony that will prove he's guilty, Ummm, yeah I don't think so either
@diane_robert3 could be and with the charges for bags now.... It certainly doesn't help things
@javy981 @gregroyce it was a pretty interesting scene after the horn sounded I‚Äôll say that much
@JKPAY didn‚Äôt like the 10min review last night? Haha. That was rough

@BHallESPN 100% correct. One of your best - ever haha
@BHallESPN great analogy !
I‚Äôm not as good looking as Evan Washburn but I‚Äôm a way better sideline reporter! Boom! #ShotsFired
Reminder for tv folks - don‚Äôt tell me a team has no FG for X amount of time. If a team goes to the FT line every trip (no FGs) they‚Äôll win
Seemed to weigh the same as the usual cream #Cooking @blueapron 
So, wait - who was that guy they just interviewed at halftime of the Duke game?
@bradheller14 Great great point my man... hope you're doing well
Am I the only one that can hear Grant Hill pumping his fist while watching this game?
@H0geyBear Congrats my man - that's tremendous. Very proud of you
@mghika Michael.... they didnt stick by an abuser in his time of need!!! Dont you get it????
@forgetlou Izzo &gt; K in my opinion. Does way more with less
REMINDER: Tom Izzo is the best college basketball coach in the country
It's a shame @CBSSports felt the need to put Grant Hill with this Nantz/Raftery team - think it could have been great without Hill
Tom Izzo is 12-1 all time in 2nd Round (now 3rd Round games) all time - truly an amazing statistic
@gregroyce @Bradley_Davis14 all time subtle HumbleBrag right there!! Well played sir
@Bradley_Davis14 #OldManTweets
@richarddeitsch totally disagree he was a train wreck throughout.And it‚Äôs an offensive rebound not something that smells bad like he says it
Congrats to @ManofSteelJR_14 on his Gatorade State Player of the Year - classy young man with a very bright future

I enjoy watching Malik Abu dunk
@theJoshBanks because pimpin aint easy!
@BHallESPN thanks - they'll be back. Think he's a legit top 10 coach in the country. Too many injuries this year
@BHallESPN that's my thought too - but I'm definitely biased. Hope you're well my man.
Listening to my wife do a general info call about @GoTeamIMPACT to the @eccsports student-athletes. #ProudHusband

First game back from having his face bashed in and RW drops a 49/16/10. Come on man....
HOPE! RT @pbouchardon7: Lay down your arms...&amp; snowshovels. The battle is over. #spring 
The word 'fearless' defined RT @SoleCollector: #MaskedRussy 
Fun night- I got to interview a young man I coached many yrs ago. Proud of who he's become | 
Rumors swirling the Greenies will be bringing it tomorrow ... Let's goooooo #WeAre
@patgallogly @SNHUFieldOps no I did not get a ticket... And props to the writer for doing it perfectly for the rear view mirror
Thanks to my friends @SNHUFieldOps for the nice message on my car for the drive home -
@Bradley_Davis14 thanks man. Can't make chicken salad out of chicken sh&amp;t haha
@goldberg_4 excitement level??? 
If you're BORED go to 
Not me I swear! RT@TheSunChronicle: New Yorker charged with fraud in Mansfield suspected of being part of fraud ring 
@GManko33 Youre coming to practice tomorrow? Sweet -
@GManko33 What can I say, I had good access to the source!
And this my friends is why Russians are tougher than us - these kids are 8!!! | 
VERY well done here @MBoen5 #Proud | 
@chrishendrick they're very good. We have to play our best game of the year
No place I'd rather be #WeAre 
Lock down RT @haralabob: This is amazing 
@ehrlich_mike looking forward to it my man - us against the world on Fri night
@ehrlich_mike let's gooooo - didn't get to see you again!
@WillKelleher235 thanks so much my man - truly appreciate the support
@72tsmith72 appreciate it my man - thanks for the support.
@72tsmith72 Friday night -8pm at Taunton
@72tsmith72 Friday night my man. We're not sure where yet
We live to fight another day. Survived. And. Advanced. #WeAre
Whitest tweet ever coming - I love the new If You're Reading This Its Too Late album. It's awesome, by far Drake's best work
As the great philosopher Pitbull once said "Everyday above ground is a great day, remember that" - Today is going to be a great day
@BBouck sometimes true love hurts Bruce
@BBouck she's awful.....
@BBouck It's 'The Women Tell All' Bruce...... and of course I am #BeBetter #LanceArmstrong
@ehrlich_mike @ehrlichmatt7 Not GOAT yet, agreed, but he's got some years to go....
@ehrlichmatt7 @ehrlich_mike Always on your side my man, especially when it comes to the King
@ehrlich_mike @ehrlichmatt7 For his CAREER:
27.4ppg / 7.1rpg / 6.9 apg
That's all
@DiCenzoRyan ok fair analysis. Just saying being in the middle is the worst place in the league to be and....
@DiCenzoRyan damage to who - Themselves by costing themselves a higher draft pick??
@GManko33 @MBoen5 Ryan (sp?) Otto... looks just like you - Michael, back me up here
@GManko33 @MBoen5 By the way, Greg, did you know there's a mini-Greg in the Mansfield hoop program now?
@GManko33 @MBoen5 I could never hate you Gregory - you provide me so much entertainment!
@GManko33 @MBoen5 I dont at all - much like with the Pats, I dont hate them at all... hate fans that are delusional or obnoxious, that's all
Just took me 3:45 min to go 126 miles and I get home and have to shovel my driveway. Someone remind me quickly why I live here!!!
@MBoen5 @GManko33 you know what moral victories are for...... LOSERS - that's who!
HUGE fan of Connecticut's 'We don't plow our highways' policy !
@ehrlich_mike @BBouck @goldberg_4 @ehrlichmatt7 woah - Matt and Sam have to approve of this. Ultimately it's their thing
@BBouck very well done my friend
@R_Lanigan but you still have hair! Lol
@R_Lanigan @ehrlich_mike that's the easiest decision you've had all year!!
@R_Lanigan @ehrlich_mike ok that's fair and that will be awesome... If anything comes to mind feel free to chime in.
@ehrlich_mike ok warming up... Well allow @R_Lanigan to chime in as well as we respect his opinion
@ehrlich_mike @ehrlichmatt7 @goldberg_4 not bad. Well come up with a few and the boys can choose. This is happening
@ehrlich_mike @ehrlichmatt7 @goldberg_4 it's the leader in the clubhouse right now. But we're not giving Erich credit for it haha
.@ehrlich_mike @ehrlichmatt7 @goldberg_4 knew I could count on you. Only suggestion that is any good so far in my opinion is Flo Bros
Ultimately my guys @ehrlichmatt7 and @goldberg_4 have to approve. And the godfather @ehrlich_mike obviously has to approve as well
@Erich_ryan @MBoen5 alright E-Rich you've redeemed yourself a little bit... That's not bad. #Better
@R_Lanigan @MBoen5 nothing weak.... We need something strong here #hatersgonnahate
@Erich_ryan @MBoen5 stay in your lane E-Rich unless you have something much better. #BeBetter
@MBoen5 as a senior and a captain, I'm expecting you or the Ryan's to come up with something
@MBoen5 like how Steph and Klay are the splash brothers. We need something like that for them but I'm not clever enough to think of anything
TMLT - these two need a nickname. Obviously something hair-related. Let's go Mansfield family, make this happen .... #WeAre
Nice to see the backwards hat brothers today | @ehrlichmatt7 and @goldberg_4
College basketball games should not take 2:35 - thanks #Pac12
We need a video replay time limit in college basketball - this is absurd.
Sean Miller just called that official bad words
@JakeTryder9 not a usual thing for us. Usually were mid-afternoon folk
@mghika agreed lol
First terrorists &amp; now this!! RT @SCMansfield: Report potholes in #mansfieldma by calling 508-261-7335 or emailing potholes@mansfieldma.com.
@nickblahday that's because you're a smart man....
@nickblahday I agree.... But they'll be tested.
@nickblahday than my HS team? I agree!
#Hair RT @SCMansfield: Mansfield beats Brookline 
This was like watching NB against us the other night RT @Hoopmixtape: Willie Cauley-Stein just ended a man. 
@jimmy_layman congrats my man. That's awesome
Wearing this to an AAU girls VB tourney makes you a legend in my book #Neon 
@foftring21 congrats on the win last night my man.
Once again this reminder - if you're recording every single play during your daughters AAU Volleyball tournament, you need a life.
@GManko33 most importantly - go win a title tomorrow my man!
@GManko33 I hope for your sake youre right. Love the passion. Just don't forget the WORST thing to be in the NBA right now is an 8 seed
@GManko33 that's a fair request. Sadly for you I only watch full NBA games during the playoffs and the Cs won't be playing
@GManko33 it's so cute Greg it really is. To think you can win meaningful games with this team
So do the Celtics 'retire' IT's number after this season or do they wait until next year?
@philladandy that's because some idiot asst coach suggested me go 2-3 for a possession!
@goldberg_4 avi game on point! Let's go
@ehrlich_mike sorry I didn't get to give you a hug / high five after the game. Found a way to advance. Proud
Survive. And. Advance. #WeAre
@JakeTryder9 @Jvg1321 I was thinking Larry Bird and JC himself #AgreeToAgree
Come on @Supercuts - Help a brother out, people are making fun of me because I'm a 37 year old man that gets my hair cut there!
@MattKaplowitz @tjfarrell9 No... they were out!
@tjfarrell9 Is that 'real' barber going to be able to add more? Sadly no, so why does it matter??? #ValuePlay
@tjfarrell9 When you've got hair like ours my man, what difference does it make?? #Cheap
Lady at Supercuts asked if I wanted my eyebrows trimmed..... #ImplyingINeedMyEyebrowsTrimmed #oldmantweets
@Jvg1321 Not lying when I say the new Avi is strong my man!
@JakeTryder9 @Jvg1321 You're a better FT shooter than he is Jake - thats for sure!
@WillKelleher235 Rumor has it you'll be going as a STUD, and just dressing as usual
Turner's 10/12/10 triple double looks a little less impressive after RW's 39/14/11 last night doesnt it C's fans?
When you're heading to work, turn on radio and the first song you hear is Centuries, you know it's going to be a good day #WeAre
@mghika he's good at the baseketball game
42/11/5 - if you don't think the postseason runs through Cleveland.....
@j_syrup good for you man. I'm jealous. Safe travels and get some Ws
@j_syrup he's in the discussion but I agree with you. Not quite there yet - hope you're well my man
So this 23 guy on the Cavs seems pretty good #GOAT
@ehrlich_mike Michigan sports aren't really holding up their end of the bargain this year!
Finally catching up on the bachelor -for 2nd straight season thisguy picked the two finalists in the draft! #Unprecedented #TheChampLives
Expecting to hear good things from my dudes @bsubears tonight. @GManko33 &amp; @RockSteadyRD3
@LanceeeReynolds Thanks for the game story - well done... and so true, Michael doesnt 'sit' well haha. See you tomorrow
Truer words have never been spoken! @MBoen5 
Saddest tweet ever RT @darrenrovell: If Michigan makes it to the NIT, this is what they will wear 
@WIZdom31 not surprising my man #GreatMinds
@WIZdom31 In that case, you have to go for it - i mean PUPPIES
@WIZdom31 Did they have a terrorist van and offer you candy as well?
Picked this up at our local pizza place last night #Grammar #Too 
@WillKelleher235 that is the look of a man that will succeed in life right there
#LEGIT #VestLifeIsTheBestLife @WillKelleher235 
@Bintroini2 !  RT @stoolpresidente: Storming the court defense on full display at Richmond. 
@Erich_ryan @goldberg_4 I didn't tell you this but he's gotten a lot better this year. Has a chance to be special good
@Erich_ryan that's nice to hear - was proud of our efforts on defense tonight especially
Somewhere @scotthanson 's head explodes MT @dwight_esq: @richarddeitsch The never before seen 21 box. 
@Erich_ryan thanks for coming out tonight my man, great to see you
@mghika @SBNation but 16yo's having Range Rovers? I'm okay with that haha
@dmk1122 Let's just say it's not all the way 'official' yet haha - hope you're well my man
Let the journey begin! #WeAre
For those folks trolling Derrick Rose on Twitter, feel free to go look in a mirror and see if you like what you see #IWouldnt
@carlenekluge Agent for future NFL superstar @kingofthehill85 ??
@R_Lanigan really well done my man
@BridgetBowes22 @amydvorah no judgment here at all - was just surprised that Monday Night Raw was being prominently displayed on our Tv!
@ehrlich_mike @goldberg_4 don't kill Sam's dreams yet. He's too young!!
My wife's WWE knowledge because of that Divas TV show is beyond alarming. #ClosetFan @amydvorah


@goldberg_4 So are you for that matter - and you're not a lottery pick
Love when I'm at a gym that seats about 3,000 people and there are 300 people here and some guy has to sit right next to me. Come on dude -
@goldberg_4 another solid big to add to that devastating front line of Sully, Olynyk and Zeller!
@KantTopAdis all is great my man -
@goldberg_4 RT @EJSantarpio: This mock draft has the Celtics drafting Willie Cauley-Stein, in which case I'll throw up.
@KantTopAdis best of luck my man. Make a run at that thing
Because of my unreasonable hatred for Oprah, this might be my favorite Vine of all time! 
@SCSU_Owls @scsueqroom I hear March is Michael's favorite month....
Our last NESN gms were yesterday @snhupenmen - thanks to all who made it possible. Truly an honor to be a part of it 
@Erich_ryan proud of you and Ryan over there - keep it rolling for a little while
@Erich_ryan we'll be out scouting but enjoy every minute and compete like hell my man.
@WillKelleher235 you're a class act my man
Ironically, this is undoubtedly one of the best coaching jobs of John Beilein's career #GoBlue
Spike Albrecht: 16 pts. 4 reb., 5 assists, 2 steals
Love that @ehrlich_mike is on fire this morning ! #UnderratedTwitterGame
@ehrlich_mike @MBoen5 @MaxBoen this year has been a tremendous success because of our new football coach
Does this video include sitting on NBA bench @goldberg_4 ?  MT @SportsCenter: Willie Cauley-Stein doing WCS things! 
WE CAN DO THIS RT @NWSBoston: [Boston] 1.1" today brings the snow-total to 99.8"; still #2, all-time record 107.6" 1995-96, 7.8" to go
Late to the party with this (sorry) but thrilled for my guy @RyanBoulter21 Congrats
@gregroyce yeah she got even lol
#TVStars @MTGassman @amydvorah #TwitterlessClaire 
@gregroyce that's pretty epic - well kudos to you because no one had any idea!!
@gregroyce no apologies my man. Appreciate all your help - imagine I'll see you a fair amount in near future
Game two - Tune In! NESNPlus 
@ehrlich_mike my partner is a good-looking guy you're right
Let's go! #WeAre 
If you're around - tune in to NESNPlus and laugh at thisguy on the right #Clown 
Let's go! #WeAre
@GManko33 just can't let one of those be to us!
@GManko33 see what the road looks like tomorrow morning. South is loaded!
@GManko33 good for you man. That's pretty cool - good stuff m
@Patriots @GManko33 - what did you win Greg?
Decent sports day on horizon RT @richarddeitsch: May 2, 2015:

Feel free to Fast Forward to about the 27min mark | 
@72tsmith72 if you're looking for sympathy, ummm yeah.... 
Just got complimented by guy in Dunkin drive-thru window on my @Spalding basketball folder. Get like us @brhill31 !
@GManko33 that's actually a smart tweet Greg. Proud moment here
Regardless of what happens going forward, this is a special group of young men. Let the second season begin #Proud #WeAre
@GeorgetownMet Never EVER share a picture like that again (for so many reasons!) haha - hope you're doing well
Mixed emotions as we recognize seniors tonight. Unbelievable group of young men that I'll always be proud to tell people I coached #WeAre
GREAT job by Carolina to get the ball to midcourt for the timeout like that.
@EJSantarpio great call by you. He's a very below average defender
I don't know why, but it makes me chuckle every time Roy W takes a timeout and takes his glasses off.
@EJSantarpio his footwork is unbelievable
@EJSantarpio Olajuwon?
In terms of level of play, going to be hard to top this one this season #DukevsUNC
@Bintroini2 could not agree with you more. He's the best
Not a UNC fan at all, but I truly enjoy watching this team play. Tokoto is my guy! Hops like @ehrlich_mike !
Hate Duke but hoping that's nothing serious for Okafor - love watching that kid play
@aaronsagraves26 for fans only... Used to drive a coach I worked with insane because officials use it to keep things close as well
Just saw a kid bang a three in warmups and do the 'hit your side of the head with three fingers' thing. Seriously
Not a hair out of place @ehrlichmatt7 #Professional #Jealous RT @SCMansfield: Mansfield romps past Dighton-Rehoboth 
Off A1A, Detroit Avenue perhaps? RT @KirFlem: Vanilla Ice busted for robbing furniture, a pool heater and bikes from a home in Florida.
BREAKING: Celtics have interest in any good basketball player that is available
@GManko33 It's so cute to read your Tweets sometimes Greg.... like a little puppy
@DiCenzoRyan You need to start praying for better things...
@mghika Same day he got to 'choose' his destination.....
To my last retweet, I see you styling there @Bintroini2 ! Let's go
Big time shoutout to my guy Frankie Oftring on joining the 1K club. Awesome accomplishment #Legit #Proud
I'm sorry but Goran Dragic does NOT get to decide where he gets traded
@AceAnbender hard to have that many when you don't miss any shots....
ESPN2 just showed a '6th man of the game' - I like awards that you have a 50/50 shot of winning
Feel like we would be doing better tonight if we started: Walton, Caris, Stauskas, GRob, and Trey.... #WhatCouldHaveBeen
Lot of college basketball teams that don't want to see Michigan State in their region... Scary team when they make shots
This is like watching the varsity versus the JV #Sigh #GoBlue
@ehrlich_mike @MaxBoen 1 of us thought Michigan would win tonight... One of us did not. Play hard just not good enough right now #Sad
Breaking: Fat player who signed big deal showed up to camp fat! MT @thebiglead: 
Thank God! We almost went 48 hours without it snowing.... #CrisisAverted
For the 2nd straight season, I can now announce to the Twittisphere that thisguy is #TheBachelor champion in our house! #TooEasy @amydvorah
Carly's 'mean girl' attitude is literally the only reason we're still watching this season of #TheBachelor
@PMcWalters_20 I see what you did there! #RoadTeamFirst
@mghika I hawnestly can nawt believe dey are retiwing his numbah guy!
@mghika honestly this is one of your top 5 tweets of all time
Hey guess what everyone- it's going to snow on Tuesday and Sunday this week!!!! #brokenrecord #juststopitalready
NBA All-Star Game, SNL 40 Special, an we're watching #TheBachelor ! Mock me if you'd like!
Feel like Ron Burgundy right now re: Mother Nature and the snow.... You ate the whole wheel of cheese?? I'm not even mad, I'm impressed!
@BHallESPN ahhhh I have heard of this - why not right? Be entertaining for some random dude to claim best dunker in America
@BHallESPN I don't know what you're referring to but hopefully i contributed positively!
Part 2: on Twitter or wherever online. Top 8-10 appear at Dunk Contest and do their thing. 100k would mean something to them.
Part 1 - Here's my idea for dunk contest. Since none of the real guys want to do it, have random dudes send in vids and then people vote
@Bintroini2 the 3point contest is way better than the dunk contest now. All the best shooters participate - agree with you -put it last.
@RockSteadyRD3 @GManko33 probably true Rock - he knew he didn't have to show too much bc he knew he was winning it. Good point
SAME DUNK RT @bubbaprog: The only six seconds worth watching from tonight's contest were LaVine's four dunks: 
@Bintroini2 totally agree but what's the incentive for them to do it right now? 100K for Lavine is huge - for LBJ it's a days pay
@GManko33 @RockSteadyRD3 because Lavine is a FREAK but do something else ....
@GManko33 @RockSteadyRD3 that's because he's a very smart young man. Disappointing dunk contest in my opinion. Congrats on the W today boys
Lavine was fun to watch but he did a version of the same dunk four different times....
Can't tell what's better in this - the dude unable to add five numbers up correctly or Oladipo's misses.
Looking forward to #ThingsFasterThanDrJ trending tonight. Jeez....
@eatclnliftheavy @RobertLeePXP TREMENDOUS
HUGE Valentine's Day for us! Making dinner with @amydvorah ! Good times. 
@tjfarrell9 @CBSSportsNet got our good friend Mr. Wolfe today
@GManko33 all good my man all good
If you're near a TV around 12:45 tune in to @CBSSportsNet - thisguy might be on!
@GManko33 you know that's where it lives my man. Get a W today
@theJoshBanks step your game up!
@Erich_ryan congrats my man. Well deserved. Happy for you and Ryan
@GManko33 don't care because I know it's ours and we earned them. Good luck tomorrow
Special night. Humbled to be surrounded by so many wonderful people - Proud to call Mansfield my home. #WeAre
@EJSantarpio he said that. Was great to see him. Fun game fun environment as well
Underrated aspect of night @amydvorah 's running commentary-she even said some not nice things which aren't pictured 
@EJSantarpio awesome to see your dad tonight #GoPats
Well now we have to add 2014 AND 2015 to this because #WeAre Hockomock Champs 
@PMcWalters_20 right??? Wtf
Good god!! From my hometown paper.... 
@HockomockSports @R_Lanigan Come on.... we wanted you to pick Franklin!
@MattKaplowitz Thats funny..... Sadly, we're all older than we once were
So weird... the hair on top of my head seems to be turning the color of my skin! Wait, WHAT?????
@blueapron It was pretty good, not a big fan of lemon chicken but it was tasty.  We're enjoying your service - thank you!
I was thinking, maybe, I'd go to the HS to see a basketball game tonight. Heard there's a big one going on #WeAre
Feel like I've seen this @umichbball game about 10 times already this year. Bummer. Kids play hard. #GoBlue
Just the way we drew it up RT @DrewCHallett: SPIKE IS A WIZARD 
@theJoshBanks totally agree with that. We just said its a helluva lot better for us than the crap we usually eat
@theJoshBanks Amy is a big fan. I don't love the lemon chicken but I don't love lemon chicken so there's probably a correlation there!
@theJoshBanks @blueapron 
@KantTopAdis That is TREMENDOUS - hope you're well my man
Bill Walton (@BillWalton ) is the Best: 
Rumor has it its @KyleWiz_13 bday today - enjoy it my man. Miss having that dude around. #Legend #Animal
Kristen Wiig over Chris Farley - STOP MT @richarddeitsch: @RollingStone ranking of 141 Sat Night Live cast members: 
@BBouck @MBoen5 well said Brucy
I can't be only one hoping its Kris RT @PageSix: Bruce Jenner will reveal his planned female name to Diane Sawyer 
@ShaneBurnison @amydvorah might be better than mine!
If the King plays enough minutes tonight - a legit triple-double is coming.
Legend defined: @amydvorah has VB practice but gets me take out to have when I get home from hoop game.
Another milestone achieved tonight. Proud of all that @MBoen5 continues to accomplish because he deserves it. #WeAre
@brhill31 might be more than we have in Us though... Maybe for the tourney?
Thoughts @brhill31 ? RT @BradBallisLife: Life

Big happy bday wishes to my guy @AsapVo900 - We'll get a W tonight in your honor. #WeAre
Best dunk contest performance ever! Vince in 2000 | 
This helps our Defense significantly. Nice. RT @D_Morgan48: Round 5 is official. Thanks NCAA 
@goldberg_4 man, you are really becoming a smart young man. Too bad you weren't w us last year, we saw KAT at that HS tourney we played at
@goldberg_4 Sam, would you admit that KAT &gt; WCS
I see you @RyanBoulter21  RT @MansfieldboysBB: 
I think Willie Cauley-Stein looks at Karl Anthony Towns and says 'man I wish I was as good as that guy' @goldberg_4
Best @espn commercial in a LONG time - well played | 
@SNHUpenmen is this week's Play of the Week‚Ä¶ 
So, the UConn women's team beat the No. 1 team by 25 points??  I'm SHOCKED!! Why do they even play these games? #givethemthetrophynow
Serge Ibaka with my new 3 dance RT @MySportsLegion: I think it's safe to say Kevin Durant has unlimited range. 
@PeteIorizzo trying to read my friend Pete's usually exquisitely-written columns and now I'm taken to something called Times Union Plus #Sad
Or as we call it now - "Tuesday" RT @MansfieldSchool: School is Cancelled Tomorrow.
Big night on #TheBachelor as thisguy has taken a 2-1 lead over @amydvorah in this year's pool! Let's. Go.
So @ABCNetwork 's programming now includes 'Blackish' and 'Fresh off the Boat' ??? Fun w stereotypes courtesy of ABC Programming #BeBetter
The Dakotas being featured tonight on #TheBachelor - assuming @coachvaughan1 and @ShaneBurnison are tuned in and enjoying!
@caliano7 hope I hear about how many parades they've had at some point soon!
@gregroyce great point by you - go elsewhere Olympics!
@caliano7 how could you expect the public transit system in a cold-weather city to work when it's cold and snowy??
@gregroyce get on board with this Olympics concept! Need the rent money!!
@elias_solis73 that is awful - sorry my man
@BBouck we have more snow here !
Hey @DunkinDonuts - want to buy yourself some good free publicity? Offer free coffee to all those good folks that are out there plowing!
@WIZdom31 more than happy to share, as a matter of fact you can have all of it!
According to local Bob Weather Guy, we've gotten 63 inches of snow in the last 17 days. Why do I live here again?
One would think with all the shoveling I've been doing, I'd be fit and trim.... Sadly, I am not
@BHallESPN thanks for the feature piece on Brendan- well done
#Warrior #Proud RT @BHallESPN: For Mansfield's Brendan Hill, waiting is the hardest part: 
Just spent the last 30 min of my life doing 20mph behind 4 plows blocking all the lanes. Truly loving life 
@MaxBoen @goldberg_4 now you're talking with that. Let's go - well done Maxy. Big day for you
@MaxBoen @goldberg_4 Wow, Maxy has a new one too .... Still too many naked dudes
@goldberg_4 Sweet new avi haha
@ehrlich_mike haha you and I can do one together - well call it a '10 minute drill'
@ehrlich_mike would have been a good prop bet - 'Who gets asked to leave first - You or Me' haha
Hearing rumors that Marshall was asked to leave today's game #Legend @ehrlich_mike
So proud of my guys. Winning 4 games in 5 days and 3 in 3 days is LEGIT
Lets goooooo. Weekend completed! #WeAre BHallESPN: Final: Mansfield 84, BC High 69 #RoadToDCU

@Smooth_CMH awesome accomplishment. Proud of you
@KyleWiz_13 @MBoen5 @brhill31 Don't remember that at all.... Bad effort by me #BeBetter
@philladandy can't wait. So happy for you and family
@gregroyce no because of Fred Brown throwing ball to Worthy and because of CWebb calling the timeout sigh....
@gregroyce will always question his two national titles....
@philladandy Congrats my man. Awesome
@MBoen5 @goldberg_4 @ehrlich_mike Would have been the best 'in game' dunk I've ever seen though in HS
@goldberg_4 @ehrlich_mike BREAKING: 7-footer can dunk. So can @MBoen5 ..., well, maybe not. #WilliesABust
Big shout out to my guy @Smooth_CMH on the new school blocks record - proud of you my man

Not terrible for me! #RoadDinner @Outback

@diane_robert3 @fox25news knowing your political leanings, I'm glad they have the traffic girl! Haha. Hope you're well
Look at @ReesesPBCups sharing the knowledge! Thanks
I enjoyed this RT @MatthewBerryTMR: Hilarious MT @THR: Watch Fallon Reunite the 'Saved by the Bell Cast 
One of my all-time favorites. Going to miss this dude a ton next year when he's off to play @UNHFootball1 #Proud 
@jgill21 congrats my good man. Good stuff
@MBoen5 well, you're already smarter.... And I say that knowing your 'lack of effort' in school
You ever wonder by @ReesesPBCups have that little paper lining on the outside? I do....
@mghika or Urban Meyer has heart problems when Florida was bad... So so so fake!
@monteevee especially from a guy who has had a career that's about 1/100th as good as Lynch's haha. What a clown
Is there anything better than a Duke floor slap on D followed by a made triple by the other team??
@SCSU_Owls @SCSUswim Great videos. Many thanks friends... Looking forward to another awesome championship
38 degrees feels like about 70 with the weather we've had recently!
@MaxBoen hope you're right. Gotta be someone
@MaxBoen awful start.... Pushed it back from 10 to 10:30, urban must have needed 30 min to wire some more money
@MaxBoen Got that one wrong .... Bummer. Need MW now
Let's gooooooo #proud MT @UNHWildcats: Please welcome Brendan Hill  TE/DE  6-4 235 Mansfield, Mass. 

Boogie!! RT @Tri_Offense: DeMarcus Cousins Does Nothing as Mo Speights Gets Easy Alley-Oop - 
Hoping for good news for @umichfootball today #NSD2015 #GoBlue #ForzaAzul
@EJSantarpio indeed I can my good man. Good point. Enjoy!
@EJSantarpio a www that's cute EJ
Proud of @brhill31 and the fact that he gets to sign an important document in his life tomorrow
But, but, but.... I thought TB was the BEST! 
I like how if it stops snowing at about 6pm, kids know not only will they have the next day off from school but the day after too #soft
Way too manly for TB anyways #honestly RT @BeaconHillSport: Reports: Brady gives his MVP Chevy Colorado to Butler. Class act guy.
Well done ! 

Insightful read RT @jasonrmcintyre: Heavily stat-based, @jasonlisk dives deep into Joe Montana vs Tom Brady 
This is quickly becoming the worst season of #TheBachelor ever. Very disappointing ....
@ehrlich_mike very true. The six SB appearances is a biggie but Joe has more MVPs.... They're 1-2 in some order in my book
Love the fact that @umichfootball just hired the HS coach of the  No 1 recruit in the class of '16 as their 'recruiting coordinator' #GoBlue
Thanking the world of big time coll fb recruiting for providing @amydvorah &amp; I with some baby names to consider! 
@GManko33 @Dibar268 You guys were due some luck, you know - after all those years of cheating and what not haha
@GManko33 @Dibar268 And that's why the rest of the country hates you! Congrats on the win though... GREAT game
@GManko33 @Dibar268 For the last time Gregory, I dont hate the Pats at all.... hate the ignorant, obnoxious fans that just assume wins!
@ehrlich_mike Congrats on the win, though - GREAT game. All I could hope for.... People will be talking about that play call forever
@ehrlich_mike @OnlyInBOS Please go look at Montana's career.... compares VERY favorably. Stats from different eras VERY hard to compare
@joe_stapes that is a very funny tweet. Well done sir #GoBlue
@mghika @ProjectRoto shocked how that all played out. Thought he should have let them score....
Sure hope I see the 'Carroll finally won a super bowl for New England' a few thousand more times on my TL #Heeyyooooo
@EJSantarpio great tweet here
@eloomer if only that pesky Gisele lady wasn't in the way!! Congrats on the win
@chrishendrick so true ... I was actually shocked Bb didn't let them score and try to get the ball back needing three to tie
@chrishendrick totally totally true. Product of 24-hour news cycle. Great game
@chrishendrick fair ... Find it so hard to compare different eras, etc. hate that everything has to be the GOAT these days
@chrishendrick that's a very good argument.... No doubt. I think he's in the discussion. Just don't think it's a no brainier all the sudden
@EJSantarpio I just don't think it's as cut and dry now. I'm rooting for him. He's a Michigan man!
@chrishendrick Montana was 4-0, no?  I love TB. Michigan man... He's in the discussion but don't think it's a no brainer. Congrats
@EJSantarpio stats are hard to compare with different eras, Montana went 4-0....
Definitely on the Mount Rushmore of QBs, but why does tonight automatically make TB12 the GOAT? And I'm a Michigan fan!
Great to see the man (even if only for a few seconds) @AsapVo900 at our game yesterday. So proud of him #WeAre
@BAPsMom612 congrats to a true fan - happy for people like you tonight
@Giggs07 too busy crying tears of joy
@cjrodgers15 @EJSantarpio for the record, I am not a Pats hater (Brady went where??). Don't enjoy pats fan that just assumes Ws....
@WIZdom31 im here for you my man
@cjrodgers15 @EJSantarpio Hi Christopher - I root for Michigan.  Grew up a Cowboys fan but not really anymoreCongrats on Deans list my man.
@EJSantarpio absolutely. Especially because I know most of you are scared to death of losing another one
@EJSantarpio no they hate Pats fans bc those of you that are obnoxious - not you though haha
@WIZdom31 you're figuratively losing your mind .... Be better #college
@JakeTryder9 good for you my man. Enjoy the day
@NECralph just not a fan of the 'why bother to play the games we're going to win' attitude. Enjoy the day / game
@NECralph reasons I'm not- 
1. Pats fans
@MikeRedding1 nice W coach. Congrats on qualifying
@EJSantarpio @TimWalsh6 I would trade it .... For a Mansfield win haha. Hope both of you are doing well
@EJSantarpio @TimWalsh6 Sorry boys. There will be no split in the season series this year.....
Excited to be back at the house that @TimWalsh6 and @EJSantarpio built
@mghika kid, I mean come ahn here - de is no way Da Pats give up 16 to dose Hawks. I've got it Pats 48, Hawks 7. #EvenWithDaHahdBaws
Big respect to the dude at the gym this am rocking the Pats Maroney jersey
@Joe_Krong in other words it's a beautiful 5<WHITE MEDIUM STAR>Ô∏è place !
@SNHUFieldOps Hoping its 'camera side' for our NESN games!
@diane_robert3 totally agree - or have both if there are folks that want to save the environment ... I want to get my hands dry!
@GManko33 No doubt about that -
@GManko33 @goldberg_4 he's getting there and it's been awesome to watch
@GManko33 @goldberg_4 Dont be mean Gregory, he's been MUCH MUCH better recently - Dude is on the ground almost as much as Higgins these days
@GManko33 @goldberg_4 sad thing is he is Gregory.... Goldy's favorite player. He roots for players he can outwork rather easily haha
@goldberg_4 very impressive 23 minutes..... LOTTERY PICK 
I'll be spelling bust 'Willie Cauley-Stein' from here on.... 0/1/0/0/0 tonight against a bad Missouri team
@THuerter congrats to your boy. Hope you're doing well my man.
Gotta be a good sign that @umichfootball is doing a special 2-hour signing day webcast, right? RIGHT???
So Sulaimon played in LAST NIGHT'S game for Duke, and TODAY he's kicked off team. That makes sense.
Hey Madre Nature - step your game up 
Love that who top recruits 'follow' and 'unfollow' these days is newsworthy and means something haha. What a time to be alive!
Wish I was at the Field when @kingofthehill85 locked up @PlanetPat24 (although Pat has better hair - sorry Jeff)
Sad it took me so long to discover @RandomThugLife - solid endorsement
Watching the #USMNT in a 'Friendly' (I.e. Meaningless game). Assume @BBouck and @R_Lanigan are proud of me #SoccerFan
Really enjoying the fact that if you've verballed to another school, @CoachJim4UM plans on visiting or talking to you and offering! #GoBlue
@BBlueRecruiting Fair point.... good debate. Regardless, happy with the direction! #GoBlue #ForzaAzul
@BBlueRecruiting Understanding the geography of that statement but Jabril still higher, no?
@mghika Probably hahah - good news for you is that 'showdown' will be available in your local market anyways!
@mghika @NBATV @celtics @nyknicks Isn't there a D-League game they can show instead?
Dear god nooooooo!!!! RT @SunChronSports: Brady sounds like he has a cold. 
@theJoshBanks The horror.....
@theJoshBanks that's some third-world shit right there!
#WeArent RT @thebiglead: VIDEO: NBA D-League Teammates Ejected for Fighting Each Other in Timeout 
+infinity RT @Mark__Snyder: Beilein: these are the things we can control. We can control our effort, how fast we run
By no means a great @umichbball team, but a really fun team to root for - play very hard for 40min and that's all I can ask #GoBlue
Proof the NBA doesn't care about the dunk contest / 3-point shootout, All Star Saturday night is on Valentine's Day this year!
We've hit 2' of snow officially in Mansfield. That's all.
Love it MT @UGAfootballLive: Jim Harbaugh is flying in to talk to #UGA commit QB Jacob Eason. Top overall prospect In coll FB. Back off Jim!
Feel like the snow plow game is a pretty good racket. Just paid guy $60 to do our driveway. Took him maybe 20 min. #WorthEveryPenny #TaxFree
BREAKING: Once again, my relationship with Madre Nature is not in good standing
Once again - athletes that make a mockery of the media doing their job (I.e. marshawn) should be ashamed. Those guys help them make millions
Am I the only one who thinks Aaron Rodgers can do better than Olivia Munn? RAWDGERS - Discount Double Check!

@gregroyce I'd complain too - Old folks pay like $2 for a good breakfast at those places! #Value
Well done here RT @HockomockSports: Taking Stock of the Hock: Boys Basketball Midseason Report - 
"There's nothing more depressing than being an adult and not being able to play in the snow like a child" -local newslady #Death #Cancer IDK
The true definition of irony is newspeople talking about power outages on tv
@NECralph because words like MODERATE don't drive ratings through the roof.... Too bad.
@NECralph at some point people will begin to understand that storms are good for tv ratings / news outlets etc and are created rather often
@SNHUFieldOps not sure my friends across town would appreciate it hahah - but the yellow tie is a definite
@HockomockSports @R_Lanigan co- POTY... No 5 &amp; No 23 #WeAre
Well this seems unfair RT @WorldStarFunny: BRUHHHHHHHH 
@SNHUFieldOps save one for me - ill wear mine on the air haha
#TheBachelor update from the VanRyn household: @amydvorah and I still have two contestants left after this weeks episode
Annoys me greatly that my local ABC station @WCVB keeps breaking into #TheBachelor to tell me it's snowing. #IveHeardOfJunoThanks
Not saying it's not justified but find it weird when a 'state of emergency' is declared and 3" of snow has fallen. #WeatherTalk #juno2015
Amy &amp; I watching replay of the @WWE Royal Rumble while waiting to start #TheBachelor - only couple in America that can say that @amydvorah
@Giggs07 like saying you'll be at work sometime between 8am and 4pm isn't it??
@eloomer stop cheating!
@LeMoyneDolphins really well done on this info graphic guys - kudos on this
@theJoshBanks 100% correct
@theJoshBanks don't let 'the man' get in the way of what's really important in life ever again!
@theJoshBanks enjoy how you turned solidarity into a verb there- strong play
Hey Boston / Providence news stations - here's a suggestion for you. Just scroll what's open! #EverythingIsClosed

Boys @ SHS Monday 2/2

In advance of the storm - don't forget to get your bread and milk! 
@philladandy @BBouck were all Dutch ! #GoodPeople
@philladandy @BBouck its a classic Andy.... Might be the best of the three
@BBouck @philladandy quote from Austin Powers goldmember Bruce ... #EssssGoooollllld
@BBouck might be the proudest moment ever for the Dutch! #MyPeople
Proud moment for my people as Miss Netherlands has made the 'semifinals' #MissUniverse
Stop the fight right now - Miss Venezuela is winning this thing #MissUniverse
Seems fixed that like 95% of judges at the Miss Universe pageant are American, no???
@CoachChrisKraus thanks for coming out today - sorry I didn't get over to say hello. Congrats on W yesterday
@BHallESPN I have to admit I find that song fairly catchy although I have no idea what it means (and I'm sure I don't want to either!)
Hey Josh Gordon #BeBetter
@BHallESPN one must ask, are you good sir in love with the coco?
@gregroyce totally laughable and shouldn't be allowed. Assume he likes his seven - figure paycheck. Where does he think it comes from ?
@RockSteadyRD3 you da (littler) man haha.
@GManko33 glad to welcome you back haha - congrats on the win streak you guys are on
@RockSteadyRD3 @GManko33 thanks for coming out today boys -
Great win against a great team. #WeAre
Hearing Trophies on way to gym is a good omen I think #WeAre @RyanBoulter21
@caliano7 agreed.
But... RT @KNegandhiESPN: "What he said didn't make any sense" - Bill Nye the Science Guy, weighing in on Bill Belichick's presser
@NECralph totally agree with you on both fronts
@NECralph totally agree and yet it will rate through the roof tonight. Congrats on the well-deserved NEC love on SportsCenter
No no no no no no no! RT @OnlyInBOS: Boston might get 24.4" of snow starting Monday night thru Tuesday. #BOSnow #WCVB 
Boom - good weekend. Flipped him from Texas RT @Balas_Wolverine: Zach Gentry, four-star quarterback pledge, commits to Michigan.
Heaven on a plate! 
Good start RT @ByAZuniga: Former Nebraska commit Reuben Jones has committed to Michigan. RT @ImDatDude44: #GoBlue 
How awesome is the world of big time college football recruiting! 
Timing of #Patriots press conference very odd in my opinion - not sure why you do that during the middle of day on Saturday
@Giggs07 @BAPsMom612 I can confidently say she had a better meal tonight
@72tsmith72 congrats my man. Good stuff. Saw you at game tonight sorry I didn't get to say hello,
Fun night. Proud of the way we played and competed #WeAre
@GManko33 that's true Greg - valid point. Also easier to hold on to the ball when it's a nerf ball....
SO MANY COINCIDENCES RT @haralabob: Data Show The Patriots Have Fumbled The Ball Far Less Than Any Other NFL Team 
Already looking forward to the '50 for 50' on #DeflateGate .... 
'What if I told you a team altered game balls and got away with it...'
@Giggs07 how dare they disrespect the greatest team in the history of the sport??
Simply put, this is AWESOME - best thing about hockey ever?? 
VC was/ is best dunker of all time. If you think it was MJ, you're just wrong RT @HoopVine: Best windmill dunk ever?

LOVE the fact that Harbaugh is recruiting / offering verbal commits to other schools like crazy #WorksForUrban
First time since Vince I am legitimately excited about the #NBADunkContest  - Greek Freek, Lavine, Plumlee, and Oladipo? Good times!
Scene - Pats Locker Room:
TB: Hey coach, how's it going
BB: Good Tom, I'm about to throw you under the bus 
TB: Thanks coach
So, I'm supposed to believe a guy who knows every detail about everything (BB) doesn't know what footballs are or arent being used? (1 of 2)
Hot Pats takes coming in 3....2.....1.....
@heatherharrisWL Well done, again (not surprising at all) - thank you

@SkyhawkCaptain I come to Stonehill to see you (well, and the basketball games) and you're not even here! #Devastating
@BigHigg good for you my man. That's tremendous
Interesting that @SCMansfield is using our players Twitter handles in their Tweets. Reminder- be smart w what you tweet or make it private
@BigHigg for what my man?
Hmmmmm RT @tyduffy: The Patriots Pass the Ball Unusually Well in Cold Weather Compared to Other Teams 
On repeat right now at gym 
Handsome man in front row there @Bintroini2 MT @MansfieldNews1: Ryan Boulter scored the 1000th point of his career 
AWESOME Video of @RyanBoulter21 getting his 1,000th (and 1,001st) #WeAre | Courtesy of @JulesHindman
TMLRT - I kid, I kid. I joke, I joke
@GManko33 maybe true - maybe hoodie told them not to haha. Congrats on the W last night - you missed a great night at the 'Field
@gregroyce @caliano7 @mghika don't lump me in with these two Greg! Haha -
@GManko33 Youre right Gregory, but do you think the Pats would have someone with a needle standing on the sideline??
@SunChronSports Really well done Mark - thanks for all that you do
Waking up to Twitter battles between @mghika and @caliano7 is way higher up on my 'Favorite Things in Life List' than it should be
@EJSantarpio Not surprising, but classy of you to reach out to @RyanBoulter21 - last night was awesome
I'll say this about #DeflateGate - I think it's more of an indictment on the officials and their inability than the Pats cheating
@caliano7 @mghika same pick every year kidddd, Da Pats to win it awwwwww
And we top off today's perfect day with a @umichbball win. Well done #GoBlue
@WillKelleher235 same here my man
Proud of the work that @brhill31 is doing with Neil -awesome to have that little dude w us. He might talk more than I do! #lockdowndefender
Best part about @RyanBoulter21 - he's avg 25ppg and after scoring 4pts in 1st half tonight, he's talking about getting his teammates open
@WillKelleher235 @RyanBoulter21 great call by you Will, you're a smart man my friend
@RyanBoulter21 yes you could have and would have - you just wouldn't have had as much fun haha
Proud of you @RyanBoulter21 
Special night - proud of us bouncing back and to @RyanBoulter21 on his milestone. #WellDeserved #Splash #WeAre
Missed you old friend #WeAre. 
Been 18 days since we got to play in front of the Hulk - looking forward to being back home tonight! # WeAre
@RockSteadyRD3 too bad you can't be there tomorrow night to see the real Klay get his 1,000th
@mghika @eloomer @amydvorah Nobody watches that - people only watch great television like the Bachelor (obvi) although dude sucks this year
@eloomer @amydvorah legit - you're in the lead.... Damn you!
#Bachelor update - 
@amydvorah - 2 contestants left (lost one tonight)
Me - 2 contestants left
@Bintroini2 @RyanBoulter21 well said, well said
@jason_bradwell thanks for the heads up that you were in my neck of the woods my man! Hope all is well
No doubt I wished @RyanBoulter21 made the front end of that 1-1 late today, but seems right he hits 1,000 at home on his birthday tomorrow
@EJSantarpio will do. Stupid game today .... Too much to describe. He was on fire though (again)
@EJSantarpio I know I just like getting under your skin haha. Can't tell me deflated balls is the difference in a 38-point win
@EJSantarpio or they could just win without cheating?? Crazy thought I know
@gregroyce  I could probably go somewhere with the woman's tires not being properly inflated but I won't.... Hahah
Only good part of day (aside from watching @RyanBoulter21 play) is the fact #TheBachelor is on tonight
No words for that one. #WeAre
@caliano7 @gregroyce I am appalled that someone would accuse our team of cheating !
Takes a special type of man to return coffee to @Starbucks because it's 'not ground right'
It just never stops with this team! Patriots gonna Patriot #CheatersNeverHoodie #NeverForget | 
Happy for all the unassuming, even-keel, true Patriots fans that I know.... Not happy for the other types of Pats fans that exist
@mkobo03 dawg dis was a tawtal and compleet mesmatch.
@gregroyce @caliano7 can't wait !! Going to be a great game. Arizona here we come!
@mkobo03 until the Masters... A tradition unlike any other
Jim Nantz roots harder for the Pats than I do for @umichfootball - jeez. Easy there Jimmy. UNSTOPPABLE !!!!
@R_Lanigan has he been good at any point in the last three-four years?
@ehrlich_mike sadly, I am not that young !
Was on fence before but now that I know the Opening &amp; Closing Ceremonies will be held at Gillette, I am ALL IN. #RentGoingUp
Remind me again why people hate the Pats.....  RT @GlobeKPD: FOXBOROUGH --  Varsity 14, JV 0 --  13:40 into first quarter.
@ChrisVillani44 always think I'm a terrible color guy and then I hear Simms haha.
@ehrlich_mike don't you have to win titles for it to be a dynasty? Haha. Hope you're well
Pats got an unbelievably good spot there
@gregroyce disappointing I know haha. Trying to be good
@EJSantarpio totally agree. Very out of character. Why?
Big time scumbag play by Wilfork.....
Kudos to CBS for showing Prov city shots instead of just Boston ones - has always driven me crazy since they're equally as close
Three '50/50' calls have gone in favor of the Patriots. Good luck today Colts. You think the NFL wants Indy v Sea or NE v Seattle.....
@mghika no Seattle would have had to go for two earlier .... Games play out differently as result of what happens early  - you know that
@mghika can not assume any of that. Come on man
Russell Wilson crying in the post game prayer circle ALMOST makes you forget he cheated on his wife with his WR's wife #Allegedly
If your team punts at midfield down by 2 scores w 7 min left in game, you should get your money back.
This game is like the JV before the Varsity #AmIRite #GoPats
@Giggs07 bold
2 people abstained from voting for #HOTY ????!!!!  Isn't that like voting for town judge and choosing not to vote for President?
When u have candy on the bench but ur not sure if ur supposed to have candy on the bench. (@SpikeAlbrecht ) @brhill31 
Good win for @umichbball but man if I was NW I wouldn't be happy with how that game was officiated. We'll take it #GoBlue
Great to see two of my guys in action today @bsubears - proud of @GManko33 and @RockSteadyRD3 and great to watch them compete. #WeAre
This will be ours at some point #Awesome 
@MBoen5 awesome! Can not wait. Hope day is a good one
Big happy bday wishes to @MBoen5 - one of my all timers. Proud of him and everything he's accomplished and continues to accomplsih

This reminder - Coach K refusing to do halftime interviews is beyond clownish.
Awesome night. Great to see that level of play and our guys being great #WeAre
Not untrue.... Sadly 
Fun coincidence that Urban promised his group he'd get a tattoo if they won it all - safe to say he wont be paying for it #BeenHereBefore
@theJoshBanks Great point - im sure they got back this morning and are heading right to class....
Went to bed with :28 left, did Urban score another touchdown while I was asleep? #Class
@aaronsagraves26 congrats my man -
@R_Lanigan unbelievably classless move there ....
Buckeyes (Urban) scoring with :28 left is the definition of classless. Well done
Well I guess this means the B1G is the best conference in college football. Hard to say but Congrats to OSU
@tjfarrell9 same way Jameis does - file your paperwork haha. What's he going to go back and be a backup?!

If you think Cardale is going back to Columbus to do anything other then gather his things.... Well, I respectfully disagree
@tjfarrell9 definitely true!
@tjfarrell9 @BachelorABC been done for a little bit now #NotWrong
Late to the party with this, but who thought the black numbers on the shoulders of the Buckeyes uniforms was a good idea?
Not sure if I watched Michigan play on my DVR at 2x they would be as fast as these two teams.
Totally disagree - rooting for league RT @ByAZuniga: Made a chart to help Michigan fans choose who to root for - 
#TheBachelor update - 
I lost one of my three tonight / @amydvorah still has all 3 of hers. #ImInTroubleThisYear
Cardale Jones will be holding a press conference at halftime to announce he is declaring for the #NFL Draft
Best TV night in a while #TheBachelor followed by college football national title game - SOLD!
@mghika U know how U knew? He wasn't barking at teammates bc he knew he wasn't playing at A+ level either / couldn't expect it from them
Sad to see it come to an end for Peyton - will always remember him as one of the smartest and best, but not THE best
@RobertLeePXP you're lucky it wasn't nascar season! Big fella would have never been in the 315! #mostrandomthingever
Might make me a bad person but this, my friends, is funny. RT @bballvines: Look at the ref 
Simms "Pretty good chance the offense can get one more shot"
Broncos trail 24-13 | @awfulannouncing
I'd like to officially welcome Andrew Luck to the Bald Spot Club of America - We're glad to have you as a member
@BAPsMom612 don't worry I don't think I have anything going on this Sunday !
@bolocobuzz it's awesome - give it a try sometime
Nantz "I'm looking at the imaginary line of scrimmage line". WHAT
@caliano7 and he can't speak in short sound bytes at all. Awful awful awful
Mike Carey is AWFUL on tv / what does he bring to any broadcast?
@caliano7 @gregroyce look how committed Royce is - what a legend. Chris - we'll party in Az on his behalf!
@gregroyce @caliano7 Care to join us in Arizona??!!
At some point Jim Nantz has to discuss if this is Peyton's last game doesn't he?!! #HelloFriends
Andy Luck is about 20 min away from taking an extremely ordinary #Colts team to the AFC Championship.
@caliano7 #GOAT
@caliano7 great I'm alive to witness this greatness. That is all.
@caliano7 already booked flight to Arizona -  not worried about these two clown shows playing now. #KissTheRings
@caliano7 no meant plugs. Dude was 'thinning' when he was at Michigan. Trust me! #TakesOneToKnowOne #GoPats
Geno gonna Geno RT @bubbaprog: UConn shooting three-pointers while up 71-9. #trollhard
@caliano7 can't he pull a Brady and get plugs and be pretty?
Pretty sure if I saw Andrew Luck sitting on the corner not in his uniform, I'd assume he needed a quarter or two
Even Pats fans think Denver fans booing down 14-7 in 2nd quarter is laughable
Must be super fun to be a def player in the NFL - hitting window is about 2 feet on QBs
Homemade Jimmy Carter's (w choc sauce obvi) @boloco #bentley - if you don't know, get to know 
I love the NFL but if that play takes place at midfield, it's a catch and we all know it.
@theJoshBanks Come on Mr. No Fun.... theyre college kids. Just beat big brother 10 miles away. Party away!
Only bad thing about Duke losing today is that my guy @the_realCG wasnt there to see it live #GolfLife
Best WR in the game. #Dez
My hatred for Coach K is obviously high, but that's not ok.... regardless of who does it.
@theJoshBanks Just beat No. 2 team in country and undefeated - Im ok with it!
Coach K should get crucified for pulling his team off the floor w/5 seconds left - he wont. NCSt should have thrown the ball ahead &amp; dunked
@aanechiarico but he's YOUR buffoon ! Guys play hard for him. I think you'll like him
So Rex is going from NYJ (no QB, good def, decent running game) to Buffalo (no QB, good def, decent running game) ?

Got it.
Let's just have the Seahawks play the Patriots in a best 2 out of 3.
Important to establish the run when you're down 31-10 w 6min left in 4th quarter !
I hate losing more than anything else in the world
Funny to read TL in chronological order w PatsNation saying season was over/refs cost them game, then moving back to "we're the best" mode
@R_Lanigan absolutely right but your point that there are folks following these accounts that should put an immediate end to it
@R_Lanigan could not agree with you more - some totally inappropriate stuff out there
Tough one today - We'll be a better team going forward as a result. #WeAre
Almost that time #TDGarden #WeAreMansfield 
Sniper! @ShaneBurnison getting some well-deserved face time! 
@chrishendrick and funny story about the 'diamonds' our kids have up.... Too long for Twitter but for another time (and it's not Pg) haha
@chrishendrick I've coached for 16 years and it was undoubtedly the best moment ever
@chrishendrick thanks man. That's from our state semi win two years ago now. Always a really fun day / experience
Unbelievable opportunity to play @tdgarden today, excited for this group to experience it. Great memories #WeAre 
@MBoen5 @RyanBoulter21 awesome to watch you guys compete at such a high level tonight. #Proud
What are these thots and why can't we trust them?
@JDicruttalo @RyanBoulter21 as an employee of the league I withhold comment but I'll just say I don't disagree
Good win against a good team in a good environment #WeAre
Reminds me of @brhill31 ! RT @AthleteSwag: When you're feeling down and need a pick-me-up 
@GManko33 agreed my brother
@GManko33 that's right - looking forward to seeing you guys play a couple times in next couple weeks.
@GManko33 that's amazing. Good for you guys haha
@GManko33 is this true Gregory?
@Jordan_Gleason1 you alright my man?
@gregroyce true. Fair point. So is playing 55 games in New England haha
@Bradley_Davis14 Nickerson Field at BU?? Haha
@gregroyce 8-team double elimination doesn't trump that? Haha. Thanks for everything last night my man
Gets sign ready "House for Rent During '24 Summer Games' RT @AP: BREAKING: Boston selected as USA candidate to bid for 2024 Summer Olympics.

@mdkimmel that's disappointing sorry to hear that... All about expectations
@mghika @UberFacts Id say mine is about $7 - Boom! #Savings
Hey @twitter - here's an idea for you. There needs to be an option for the opposite of 'Favoriting' a tweet. Like a 'Hated' option

@mdkimmel Need a scouting report on that - heard good things and looks AMAZING! Hope you're well my man
This is my DREAM Job - throw deep every single play! MT @PSchrags Hearing ex-Jags OC Jedd Fisch will be offered pass gam coord. job at Mich

@NECralph @PackNetwork @kjcardinal Great point - solid Tweeter too... very disappointing!
@PackNetwork Pros are going to be pros - I never doubted you one bit!
Hey @PackNetwork - Dont treat that killer open from last night like a snuff film... the people want to see it!
@GeorgetownMet First of all - Vegas ALWAYS knows.... second of all, Boston WAY too low.... third of all, TOO MANY CAPITAL LETTERS
.@amydvorah - Are you even alive if you're a person who doesn't take 1000 napkins when you go to Chipotle? 
@theJoshBanks Cant wait till they start posting kids' Mix tapes and highlight reels from AAU events #Jokers

"Fun to watch them compete and play at a high level" - Baby V #WeAre 
Only lost two followers last night with my #Bachelor rants - not too bad.... #hatersgonnahate
Really proud of what my guy @brhill31 is doing - coaching and being a mentor, as well as his working with TI to help a young man #Better
@gregroyce don't ruin my support &amp; admiration! (But that is a great point)
@tjfarrell9 although much better than 'Sport Fishing Enthusiast' and glad to hear you watched!
Draft has been done - trying to defend my title and BEST performance in #Bachelor history! Swung for the fences - we'll see if it works
Kudos to ABC for having a 'plus-size' model as a contestant on this years Bachelor &amp; HS girls soccer coach is NOT a full-time job.
@MBoen5 you sir are 100% correct
The fact that a number of my guys are doing #TheBachelor drafts tonight makes me beyond proud
@MBoen5 @ABCNetwork they screwed it all up - started cocktail party without all the girls being there. Terrible!
I'm not even kidding - this is the angriest I've been since we lost to CM in the Tourney last year. #BeBetter @ABCNetwork
Hey @ABCNetwork - thanks for ruining #TheBachelor draft!! Absolutely brutal
Proud that I broadcast games for a school that advertises during The Bachelor!  @snhupenmen
T- 1 hour.... Feel the excitement! #TheBachelor
Dude next to me on treadmill has on a sweater over a button down shirt and khakis on! #BeBetter
Same thing I say every year to these jokers - Gyms are open all year not just in January! #ClownShow
@tjfarrell9 Dont hate, appreciate.....
Reminder- tonight is the best (non-sports) television night of the year. #TheBachelor season premier.
Looking forward to losing lots of followers over the next couple of months #TheBachelor
T-22 hours until the best show on TV returns.... #DraftNight @amydvorah
@BAPsMom612 @amydvorah @Giggs07 And he's already smarter than the majority of Pats fans!
@BAPsMom612 perfect he can spit up and poop all over that stuff haha. Miss you guys
What do you mean 'what if' RT @amydvorah: @BAPsMom612 @jvanryn2424 @Giggs07 #truth #whatifthebabyisapatsfan?????
Game prep for @snhupenmen DH vs @SCSU_Owls on Wednesday - looking forward to seeing lots of good folks 
@NECralph he's so good in the postseason isn't he? Impressive - it'll be a fun game Saturday
@Giggs07 it's funny how quiet they've been after watching the Ravens take care of the Steelers.... They can't be nervous can they??
I don't know who wins but I do know Pats Nation has become a little less cocky after watching yesterday #StillWinninItAllKid
@EJSantarpio we re-lived that f'ing shot before the game on Friday
Mansfield plays at 5 at the Garden on Saturday - the Pats game kicks off at 4:35....
@EJSantarpio haha don't put yourself down - you DID have a mediocre HS career! Haha
@EJSantarpio until the playoffs, yes....
@tjfarrell9 his stupid prancing and posing... And he sucks haha
Cam Newton is impossible to like / root for.
The Red Sox pink hat fans think Panthers fans doing the Sweet Caroline 'duh da da' is lame.
I feel like if your daughter is kidnapped three times, you're an unfit father #Taken3
@MattKaplowitz awesome my man. Enjoy the time
@MattKaplowitz Vaca or work - related .... hoping for the first one
Huge effort by Boogie late in the 4th quarter of a one-point game 
Supposed to be 61 tomorrow and we've barely had an inch of snow so far. #BestWinterEver
@brhill31 it begins on Tuesday
Fun fact from @BillSimmons column - Ryan Tannehill now has as many 4,000-yard seasons as John Elway and Joe Montana combined
Maybe this should be our new one @brhill31 ... RT @nba : That handshake tho 
@GManko33 too bad my man haha. Great memories
I see you there @GManko33 - nice performance in the W tonight. Congrats
Here's my prediction from today's developments with the @Eagles - Chip goes all-in with a Ricky Williams like offer for M. Mariota.
@gregroyce mine is that Chip goes all in with a Ricky Williams like draft offer for Mariota
Thoughts on today's game live from @amydvorah 's stomach.... #WeAre 
Interesting internal debate - Hate MSU and OSU as much as anyone but was definitely rooting for both of them yesterday #GoBlue
Hoping the Title game next Monday starts at about 10pm EST so i can't even make it to halftime! Come on TV folks! #oldmantweets
Makes me sad that OSU apparently has three kids that would have started at QB for Michigan this year....
By the way, a little early to speculate but this could be a VERY big day for the B1G Conference @bigtenconf

@theJoshBanks totally totally agree
@theJoshBanks we said the same exact thing like 10x last night. Plastic glasses industry needs to steps it's game up prior to '16
@MattKaplowitz @amydvorah thanks my man. Happy new year to you and the family
@EJSantarpio great my man - looking forward to it. Enjoy the night and be safe
@EJSantarpio probably true. I don't know enough about the early years to agree / disagree. Happy New Years my man - we going to see u fri?
@EJSantarpio greatest what? Spurs player? Sure...
@LettersK @theJoshBanks cute that Toona is now tweeting from his wife's account singing his praises!! Haha. Happy New Years guys
2014 - Truly best year of my life -Wedding/Honeymoon/Baby on way. Thanks to @amydvorah as none of those would have been as fun w/out her!
Should mention it was about 25 degrees.... RT @OnlyInBOS: Boston's final sunset of 2014. #NewYearsEve 
Boom! #Baking #WhyFilterThat 
Here's what happened today for Michigan -
1. Introduced Harbaugh
2. Won B1G Opener 
3. Michigan State &amp; Ohio State lost 
#TodayWasAGoodDay
Try to come up with a better Football / Basketball coach combo in America - you can not! #GoBlue 
One reason today was a good day! #GoBlue 
Just catching up on DVR - awesome that Michigan played 'Centuries' during Harbaugh video prior to his halftime speech today
@Giggs07 @amydvorah 'Surviving??' It's been a non-stop party... Capped off with dinner at Red Robin - YUMMM....
Needless to say, but today is a GREAT day to be a Michigan fan #GoBlue
Gross... RT @AthleteSwag: This 16-year-old can fly <FLUSHED FACE> 
If nothing else, I'm thankful Bob Stoops doesn't coach my team. Good god OU ....
@EJSantarpio my bad. Didn't do any research (obviously) - we'll see what happens this time ....
Brady restructured his deal (again) so Pats will be losing Edelman and Amendola to Denver this offseason. #HistoryRepeatingItself
@MaxBoen when Harbaugh has us playing for a national title in 3-4 years, you can not hop back on board. Just telling you that right now
Bday s/o to my guy @MaxBoen - liked him a lot more when he was still a Michigan fan, but still a good dude
@mghika @gregroyce I agree with Ghika on this - it's pretty random and you shouldn't be rewarded for being the best of the worst imo
@monteevee we're more than happy to welcome you aboard.
@mghika well I didn't mean your division. I meant the NFC south. Easy guyyyyyy
TREMENDOUS RT @UMMaizeRage: In honor of the man himself Jim Harbaugh, Maize Rage will be hosting a "Khaki out" for the game Tuesday
@mghika but but but winning your (crappy) division means SO much!
Steelers running on 3rd and 8??!! Somewhere @RobertLeePXP pumps his fist wildly with that play call.
I can't make many things in the kitchen (basically 0) but I am like the Martha Stewart of pre-made pull apart cookies!
After many hours of thought, our unborn baby finally weighs in on our game earlier today #WeAre 
@aaronsagraves26 title here we come haha. Hope you're well and happy holidays
Supercuts this morning 
Lady working: 'what can I do for you today?' Me: 'Add some' 
#FolliclyChallenged
Buzzkill dude MT @evansilva: Interested to see how long Harbaugh lasts in college -Wouldn't be surprised to see him back in NFL in few years
@koadmedia amen to that
@GManko33 sadly probably true but if you guys keep hanging around in mediocrity (8 seed in playoffs) you're not winning anything either
LOVE the fact that it's the final Sunday of the NFL regular season and all anyone is talking about is Harbaugh to Michigan.
@GManko33 more disillusioned .... Michigan fans or Celtics fans? Haha
National title (obvi) RT @BBlueRecruiting: With Harbaugh in the fold, what is your realistic expectation for his first season?
@chrishendrick do think the game changes significantly in next decade. We'll see...
@chrishendrick no chance our kid is ever playing football (let alone being close enough to being good enough ...) haha
Boom! RT @ClayTravisBGID: Jim Harbaugh to Michigan is the Big Ten equivalent of Saban to Bama. Wolverines are back.
Fun note from yesterday - @amydvorah and I (without knowing) bought each other the exact same gift. #RemoteCarStarterTwins
@GManko33 feel the excitement Greg! Getting swept in first round and getting a bad draft pick as a result!!
@H0geyBear it's annoying to me. Merry Xmas my man
@H0geyBear nope 100% correct - I might go back to the 5s because of this
HUGE day for our unborn son!#DoesntHaveAChoice #GoBlue 
Early favorite for best gift of the day! #GoBlue 
@Bradley_Davis14 we call that a Christmas miracle! Haha. Happy holidays my man
@gregroyce mass problem too.... Happy holidays my man
@chrishendrick that looks tremendous. Happy holidays my man. Still need to check out this BTS place w you at some point

The other is the guy with more receptions, yards and TDs. 
Anyone else think this controversy surrounding 'The Interview' is just an elaborate publicity stunt? #IDo
No doubt this is happening #GoBlue RT @umichfootball: Happy Birthday, Jim. #GoBlue 
Interesting headline here - not sure how the @SienaSaints overcome! 
@tjfarrell9 It's legit 2.49 out here! What a country!
@eloomer Didn't know there were any ;) haha - hope all is well and hope to see you at some point!
@Bradley_Davis14 Honestly, what a country! Hope your journey is going well
Just paid $2.49 for gas #TweetsNotFrom1999
@Giggs07 I would never do such a thing. Awesome smart fans
According to my TL, due to the Broncos loss tonight, the Patriots are now in the Super Bowl so I'm pretty fired up about that. #gopats
@mghika @Giggs07 That's amateur Greg .... Very very amateur.
Hope..... RT @tbeindit: 2015 5-Star Small Forward Jaylen Brown To Take Official Visit To Michigan. 
Great to see so many familiar faces at tonight's game #WeAreMansfield
Kudos to these two tonight #Class | 3-0 @Bintroini2 &amp; @brhill31 
Apparently this week the baby starts forming thoughts so I'll ask him what he though of tonight's game... #WeAre 
@MBoen5 definitely is and I like Jake but Parsons???  Come on now....
@GeorgetownMet good god - how come you never told me you were related to Kevin Spacey??!!
@GeorgetownMet there are few things more Conn / White than the 'Mathews family photo collection'
Woah high high praise for Jake here RT @JonRothstein: So much Chandler Parsons in Jake Layman.
Bodes well for Harbaugh -&gt; Michigan RT @AdamHBeasley: Steve Ross just told reporters that Joe Philbin is coming back in 2015.
Feel for Rex - team plays hard for him, they're just not a good team.
@Bradley_Davis14 We love Hilton Head - got married there. Skull Creek Boathouse has awesome seafood / atmosphere.
@Bradley_Davis14 What are you guys doing down there? Beautiful! Where we got married
Packers throwing on 1st and goal from the 1 with a 10-point lead w 3min left!!???  Cue Rodgers for MVP efforts lolololol
@NECralph I thought that was the correct call - at least didnt think they could overturn what they called on the field
Week after week, @AndrewCatalon shows he is the best-prepared PBP guy in the #NFL - CJ Fedorowicz?? Who?? Good stuff, Cat
@caliano7 Seriously, the NFL should be doing this
@caliano7 Making my idea even better... our pittance of a salary would be much more valuable because we wouldnt spend out cashhhhh on that
@caliano7 Im dead serious about this .... how awesome would this be? We could listen to Tommy Bwady EVERY game
TMLT: I would gladly pay 5 american dollars to listen to Cutler watch Clausen today! #NFL
Hey @nfl - here's a free money-making idea for you - Mic-up every player in the league and charge fans $5/game to listen to their favorite
Look at my guy @BBouck getting some well-deserved attention for his work with young people / volunteer efforts! 
Similar to Manziel's career? RT @darrenrovell: Kyle Field demolition, making way for $485M renovation at Texas A&amp;M 
SI senior writer doesn't have the Ticket?? RT @GregABedard: Thanks for the scintillating Rams-Giants tilt in the Boston market, NFL TV guys.
Just throwing this out there - if you're a guy wearing a V-neck to the gym, I think less of you
Hearing 'Juicy' followed by 'Centuries' on way to gym on radio means today's going to be a good day
@GeoffLopes dude today's only the 21st - PLENTY of time haha
One way to defeat a little kid.... #HaveSome 
@theJoshBanks @chrishendrick I want some game tomorrow to refer to the Monday Night Football game of the week - Sunday edition
100000% true. Arena-football style. Coaches will never learn RT @TheCousinSal: Philly should've let the Skins score with 1:30 left.
"Thursday Night Football."
"On a Saturday?"
"Yes. Do you have any other ideas?‚Ä¶
UCLA was 3-37 from the floor in the first half.... that is absurd.
Look who's photo-bombing @ryoneil97 in this picture! #lookingthrilled @amydvorah 
@BBouck They would beat the 76ers...
.@GregAnthony50 just said 'credit Steve Alford and his staff for still coaching' There's 12:30 left in the FIRST HALF!
I remember the days when Michigan football and basketball used to be good. #SadTimes
Fired up I have a reason to care about the FCS Semis today - lets go @UNH_Football for my guys @MHersh_132 &amp; @brhill31
@MaxBoen RT @Mark__Snyder: Michigan changes starting lineup: Ricky Doyle in 
@JakeTryder9 to get food? Wild guess

Boom RT @ByAZuniga: @marcelluswiley just said on ESPN radio that Jim Harbaugh has already signed his contract to coach at Michigan.
My wife would not move from her spot by door bc 'we started playing well when she was standing there' My affect on her! @amydvorah
2-0 | the brain trust. @Bintroini2 &amp; @brhill31 
@R_Lanigan @Josh_Perry10 if we don't get the heavy hitters (either of you two) it doesn't count haha
Your thoughts on tonight's game baby VanRyn #WeAre 
@Josh_Perry10 haha I don't blame you we can be pretty difficult.
@Josh_Perry10 there's a boys game at KP if you're interested haha. Hope you're well my man
@Bradley_Davis14 well that sounds pretty damn awesome. Safe travels
@GeorgetownMet @chrishendrick @theJoshBanks yo I was. We were boyz!!
@mghika Sad, one of the all-timers.... Almost as good as Kaleigh Rose's 'Thats none of my business' Meme about the Pats
@eloomer And you 'missed' this weather!! And it's not even that bad!!  Welcome home haha
First Friday night game of the year on the road against a good team. Should be a good environment &amp; looking forward to the challenge #WeAre
Steve Levy just asked Jahlil Okafor (a freshman) about it being a 'tournament-like' atmosphere. Ummmmmm he's a freshman friend
@gregroyce @JayBilas Awesome listen during a game though. Really educational and funny IMO. Tough to be that good consistently for 2 hours
Wait, Duke's getting a good whistle?!!!??!???  I'm shocked!
.@JayBilas is the best color commentator in not just college hoop but in all of sport and it's not even close. Entertaining and informative
Love the fact the 76ers are going to have J Okafor / J. Embiid / N. Noel next year. How fun will that team be? #TripleTowers
@Bradley_Davis14 @caliano7 not untrue ....
+1 RT @ryenarussillo: No real problem w/ Rondo deal. But if you told Celts fans this is what you would get for him a few years ago...
@GManko33 yeah hard to trade the best player in the deal but you got more picks (although won't be great bc Dallas is good obv)
@GManko33 but but but.... Good trade for both sides although you could have gotten more for him last year or this past summer
@GManko33 so about those playoffs Gregory...
@caliano7 @Bradley_Davis14 whoa with the hostility!! Thank god you have like 6 weeks off over there haha
@NECralph As Jaws himself likes to say 'the reason I watch film is because film never lies' Ummmm.... happy holidays my man
@heatherharrisWL thats super cute - hope you're doing well coach!
@R_Lanigan @HockomockSports Kudos to you guys on another great year.... we appreciate what you guys do for our student-athletes
@Bradley_Davis14 The struggle is real at MC!
@goldberg_4 haha I have faith in you! And that's why I gave you until February!
@goldberg_4 one of us has to have it for you! Don't worry my man, by Feb you'll be averaging 2 FG attempts per game!
I agree. Kudos to you town manager RT @sueweinsteinWL: Mansfield town manager; Main Street needs to be resurfaced next year.
@goldberg_4 dude - I'll take my chances with you shooting a layup every single time!
Looks a little like @goldberg_4 at times (but he wouldn't take jumper either!) 
@hannibalburess: I'm sorry Detroit.
 
@PMcWalters_20 so tough being an unpaid student-athlete isn't it?? Haha. I haven't had that nice a meal in years!
The struggle.... RT @dukeblueplanet: Top-notch team dinner with a view tonight 
Guess now we know why Michigan has always been the favorite in the  'Harbaugh's next job' prop
Trying to debate how much I would pay to see video of the Bears telling Cutler that Clausen was starting this weekend
If we're seriously offering Harbaugh 49 mil over 6 years, why don't we just offer Saban the same deal?? @umichfootball
Congrats to @brhill31 on beginning his coaching career with a win 
Just asked my unborn son what he thought of tonight's game #WeAre 
Pregame Music #GardenMemories #WeAre 
Everything is awesome! RT @SethDavisHoops: I'd guess NIT. RT @RynoThomp: by the end of the year where is Michigan - NCAA or NIT?
Let the journey begin #WeAre
@caliano7 nah guy our pats make da playoffs everrrry year!
@RockSteadyRD3 miss you my man. Hope school is going well
@72tsmith72 congrats my man - that's tremendous news
Congrats to my guy @RockSteadyRD3 | 
@EJSantarpio Too busy winning those AFC East Titles and not the Big One, you're right, my bad...
@EJSantarpio Interesting you believe that a six seed is a bad thing for them.... I think they're pretty good. 35/5 vs. 32/8 by the way
@EJSantarpio @ Tampa Bay, Home vs. Detroit remaining - do you honestly think they will not make the playoffs?
@EJSantarpio So so so cute you think that EJ
@PeteIorizzo Great point.. if this series is cancelled bc of egos..... well - i dont know what to say other then that would be beyond silly
@PeteIorizzo I'll be PC here and say - shouldnt UA be thrilled to play in front of 10K each year (once)? Hope you're well

Dez Bryant is rather good at football
@mghika longevity records are garbage. Agreed. See: Rose, Pete

@gregroyce +1 but I'm assuming for different reasons haha
@theJoshBanks every day I thank my lucky stars I'm so close to such amazing talent and skill
The Patriots throwing deep every play up 38-13 in the 4th is just so.... Patriots
Was that the first time all year 'Referee Expert' Mike Carey got a call right??
FWIW: I said RG III couldn't play in league and I don't think Manziel can either #butthoughtRyanLeafwouldbebetterthanPeyton #Analysis
@gregroyce @caliano7 @mghika haha that's  funny because Brady is the only thing I actually do like! And don't worry it may return...

@monteevee I've always wanted to go back to Annapolis. Maybe we should try and coordinate a reunion weekend!

@GoGoldenKnights thank you. Means a great deal to me.
@KantTopAdis @Marcus_Giese14 proud of both of you and excited for your next step as well
There's a handsome man! And there's me too! 
#BigTime 
@eloomer Congrats!!!!!!!!!!
Hmmmm MT @tyduffy: Michigan has all but yelled with a bullhorn they are waiting for end of NFL season. There's a reason - It's worth it.
Once again thrilled to be a part of todays @snhupenmen TV DH on NESN Plus - Womens game at 3 | Mens game at 5
@gregroyce don't know who it was but the guy doing the game and his (lack of) knowledge weren't great tonight IMO
@MBoen5 I said we'd be between 12-18 the other night when we talked about it... A chance to prove folks wrong but work to do
#BabyStuff with @amydvorah 
Going to register for baby things at Babies R Us - let the fun begin!
KF's Jed Hughes placed Brandon &amp; Hoke. Both fired.
Now hired to find replac‚Ä¶
@mghika Is there any doubt his legal team is going to get him off this thing or at least down to like a slap on the wrist?
#ConqueringHero 
@DanRobert_44 that is tremendous! Congratulations my man.
@theJoshBanks @chrishendrick top ten tweet all time by Mr. Banks. Very well done sir.
@Joe_Krong Yeah, I know..... good gig haha.  Enjoy it safe travels
@Joe_Krong How tough is your life??
@GManko33 Should we revisit that lineup debate? #Cespedes
#GamePrep @snhupenmen 
@GManko33 Totally fair.... you may be right there - Regardless, neither team is winning it all in '15
@GManko33 Younger, better lineup, better rotation, no??
I see you @RyanBoulter21 | 
@GManko33 Youre talking about who is the better team to sign with today - correct? Ill go Cubs
@GManko33 Gregory, which team had a better record last year?
@gregroyce not confident that would lead to wins at this point!
@caliano7 blind squirrel meets nut
@caliano7 I did actually see that and you know what - good for them. Because you're right. There's really nothing better than a sundae bar!
@caliano7 you stop it right now. Just stop it.
A technical school and a directional school in the same week.... At home! And now we go to Arizona. Haha. When does football start?
@the_realCG that is VERY well done
@SInow should have been sportsman of the year
@SNHU_Equipment I am definitely stopping by Saturday before the hoop games - Tremendous news!!
My guess for overplayed warm up song of this years basketball season is '0 to 100' real quick, real quick
.@CoachChrisKraus and Stonehill got a good one today. Brings it every day and is the type of young man you want to go to war with @MBoen5
@Smooth_CMH congrats on the honor my man. Great stuff
@BHallESPN well played sir. That's funny. Hope you're well my good man
@gregroyce @Bradley_Davis14 perfect - frates is even better
@Bradley_Davis14 @gregroyce I honestly thought they were going to give it to Lauren Hill
@Bradley_Davis14 @gregroyce I'm not ready to go there because nobody could score this year - it was an awesome awesome run but SM of year??
@dmk1122 totally agree. He didn't deserve it but there were better stories than MB!
@Bradley_Davis14 @gregroyce was wondering if we were going to hear from you on this. You have to admit...
@gregroyce but but but he dominated for 3 weeks!!
Boring, simple choice. Should have been more creative IMO MT @ChrisMannixSI: @SInow Sportsman of the Yr: M. Bumgarner 
Congrats - one of my all time favorites RT @NERRHoops: Michael Boen, a 6'4 guard from Mansfield (MA), committed to Stonehill last night
Punting down two scores with a 4th and makeable and the ball just shy of midfield w 6:38 left in game?? Curious at best no?
Who looks like a bigger clown getting fired up and yelling 'lets go!' - me or Tom Brady? Haha
@bg637 Too bad because TB will be in the debate of 'best ever' rather than the top of the list
@Bintroini2 Edelman home run - classic haha
@bg637 well that's true - but what if they drafted well? Understanding hindsight is 20/20
Serious tweet time: Eli for Rivers, which team says no? #Irony #CauseItSortofHappenedBefore
@bg637 seriously how many more rings would this team have if it had a GM?? 2? 3??
I'm apparently the only person in America who thinks this but I can definitely see how the refs would miss that call on Browner
@Giggs07 that my friend is a GREAT point
@mghika @Giggs07 very true and how that would have shaped the college fb world as well #Saban
@EJSantarpio @Bintroini2 I actually hope you're right with that. I want to see TB get a freak like him before it's over
@mghika @Giggs07 bandwagon has always had a negative connotation
@bg637 hahaha that's funny. Great list. Well done sir
@chrishendrick exactly and what did they do that year??  Wouldn't want to do that again now would you??
@Giggs07 nah Rivers is good. Just hate the act sometimes. And his throwing motion is so GD odd!
@Bintroini2 actually think that's why Lafell has had such a good year but imagine if they had like Julio or someone like that. Impos to stop
TMLT- I'll say it until his career is over, it's a shame the Pats never went all-in and got a Julio or an AJ Green type to pair with TB12
@Bintroini2 not a burner though- possession receiver. Not a home run guy.
If I coaches against the Pats O, I'd blitz about 85% of the time. Who scares you to get open quickly and make you pay?
Considering he's been showing up his teammates all night, maybe Philip should spend the next 5 mins screaming at himself for that throw
@Giggs07 @mghika is that because they haven't won much down there recently
@mghika so dood maybe you and I can go chek out da boyz on da duck boatts and have some hahpoons!
.@mghika just about done with it - don't worry. Only ratcheted up when people were planning the parade with 5gms left in the regular season
.@theJoshBanks mghika @Giggs07 Worse here because it's where we live!!! Hahaha. Fair fair point. Still, Sweeeeet Carolinnne bum buh bum!
This sort of speaks to my point Pats fans - my local paper RT @SunChronSports: OK, great field position. Should mean a halftime lead.
@chrishendrick @EJSantarpio @theJoshBanks and FYI you brought yourself into this w the troll comment haha
@EJSantarpio @chrishendrick @theJoshBanks Hahaha not at all. It's cute that getting there is enough for you guys now !
@chrishendrick @EJSantarpio @theJoshBanks So now it's based on appearances?? Interesting. Does this make that Bills team the best ever??
@GlobeBobRyan Great to meet you yesterday after the SNH game - be well and hope we cross paths again down the road.
@Giggs07 @mghika no I definitely did not...so it might actually be a little higher!
@mghika I actually think this is one of your all time best ideas!
.@mghika just being like approximately 75-80% of your fan base and you know it. #TheTruthHurts
@Giggs07 so true. It'd probably be the national belichick league!
@mghika isn't this your idea for saving a roster spot?
That's more like it! #56DaysTillAnotherRing
.@chrishendrick @EJSantarpio as soon as I see the rings without filming other teams.... Then yes. Until then, no. #Spygate @theJoshBanks
Why are my Pats playing like the Packers inside the Red Zone tonight? #amirite
@Giggs07 so true and so so glad they did too haha. Pats fans are brutal as it is - can you imagine if they had a perfect season??!
@chrishendrick @EJSantarpio You guys (and pats fans in general) just make it so easy because of the &gt; than attitude
@EJSantarpio not at all I think it's true and if BBs ego wasn't the size of NH he would have gotten him better WRs and another title or 2
@EJSantarpio always been a Brady guy (Mich). Drives me crazy that BB is revered because he has a top 5 all time qb....
