@Krepadoodle Perfect...i just read an article that Babcock is looking for 40 mil over 6 years
@DiscoveryCanada Sharks with Laser Beams?
Dumb question for my hockey followers:

Does a coach's salary affect cap space...or is it just a team expense?

Some of my favourite tweets of all-time have come courtesy of @Dave_CHED 
@jimchandler1075 Hey Jim...you still mad at @OpieRadio?
#CANvsUSA #CBCSports #Sochi2014
@Dave_CHED I would like to see Tavares win...but it'll be Price.
Holy Boats, those Aussie accents were horrendous Bahds...lol 
@RiderColin Or is it... *Hugs Colin*
@RiderColin No because it's your mom!!!
@markmatthews222 needs 9 points to break the old @NLL record for points in a season.  #GiveTheManTheBall @TheEdmontonRush

@TorrensJonathan @Taggart7 Not to be "me me me" but I really think you guys should do your next live show in Edmonton.

#HomemadeBbqBurgers 
@tattoosandbones Did you enjoy the museum? Learn lots of neat things?
This is the most Canadian tweet ever... #Canadianity  
@OpieRadio @AgathaC80 You sir have great patience having to put up with people like her.....and me (for other reasons)
There was a large explosion. A "potatoe masher" grenade landed feet from Johnson.  He didn't make it to the barn 
His cover fired allows me and Simmons to carry the wounded to a near by barn.  As soon as we got to the barn... 
..."Johnson we need to get outta here. As soon as I said that Johnson kept over the embankment &amp; returned fire..." 
Well we were held up in Ortona.  The Nazis were relentless in their counter-attack. That's when I said to Johnson... 
@edmontonjournal @doniveson @GKentEJ Awesome!  Thanks!!
@Archaeologuy Happy Anniversary...your wife is a lucky gal!!!
@doniveson @edmontonjournal Ok...will have to search it out :)
Let's see if I can get another RT from @BenningtonShow  for the second day in a row #Bennington
@doniveson is there video or an article outlining your #sotc2015 ?
For fuck sakes...guess I should read their platforms more closely #abpoli #Ableg #BackfiredArgument #GuessIWasWrong 
@JonLueke NDP colours are Orange and Green...lol
@JonLueke I understand that..
@JonLueke But you konw what happens when you mix Orange and Green? You get Shit Brown!!! #DumbCymbalCrash
@JonLueke this is the right voting compass....lol I was wondering why Redford was an option...haha


@JonLueke I don't know if I would trust the Alberta Party leader tho...he looks like Lex Luthor from TV "Smallville" 
@JonLueke 
@JonLueke 
@JonLueke Then again maybe I misread their platform...lol
@JonLueke Well then maybe you should look at the Alberta Party...reading their platform they seem sort of centralized.
@JonLueke There is no viable alternative...sadly the PCs are the lesser of the 5 evils...if you count the Alberta Party...lol
@JonLueke Jesus!!! #PraiseBeToGod
@artiequitter's analogy of the ATM was perfect...
If you vote NDP because you want change...you'll get change...along with $2.00/L gas.

@TheTowelBoy Yeah, just tell'em @IAmByks sent you.
@TheTowelBoy Surprised you didn't get that tweet...maybe call the @EdmontonOilers office to confirm the details. I might be wrong
@TheTowelBoy You were voted #1 Oilers fan...and you get box seats in the new arena
@Engineer_Jim "The jungle baby...you're gonna die"?????
@hodl_ryan @laettnerbball maybe he meant "sweaty" cause you're playing ball all the time and AutoCorrect changed it.
@JonLueke @Morley_Scott @Dave_CHED If there's one thing I learned from #Madmen is "Never Trust A Campbell"

@boo18304 @OpieRadio hahaha me too #BandwagonFans
@IAmByks 
I find it somewhat ironic that Nassau Coliseum sat empty for years...now the Isles are in the playoffs and it's full #BandwagonFans
@boo18304 @OpieRadio If my shitty Oilers weren't getting McDavid I might have to jump on the Isles bandwagon next year.
@OpieRadio This game is crazy!!! One of the best series this year.
FUCK YEAHHH.....#GoIslesGo @OpieRadio
Offensive graffiti on town cenotaph outrages Wetaskiwin residents

@IAmByks @Section_O @Dave_CHED did you passout like Stone Cold?
@jessebeyerCTV @adamferrara is that "Funny As Hell"? I love his bit about his dad...makes me well up with tears. Great story!
@Taggart7 That's a 17 year old?...lol he's bigger than you and me...lol
@northsidegreg honestly tho...Even our defence right now would make Ward look mediocre
@northsidegreg You're starting to sound like MacT...lol
@Taggart7 FANKS!!!!! #BangersAndMash
@northsidegreg yeah...unfortunately we can't trade goalie for goalie in this league...damaged goods
I always go to New Zealand to meet Latin people... #BorderSecurity
@northsidegreg Well i read rumors the Oilers might be going for that one college goalie.  Sort of like they did with Schultz
@northsidegreg I honestly don't think Scrivens is that bad if he didn't face 40 shots a game
@northsidegreg I agree...but we need to fix that middle portion of the ice.
@northsidegreg If this new managment actually trades for it. You can't have a shit ton of talent up front and hope for the playoffs.
@northsidegreg I hope the new management trades some of the "young guns" away to get a decent couple defencemen.
@northsidegreg Well of course I would too...but he also has a good defence in front of him in Minny
@northsidegreg i'm still laughing at the people that are bitching the oiler should have kept him...lol
OOOOHHHH YEAH!!! #GoSensGo
@SnapperSnafu GO SENS GO!!!
GO SENS GO!!!  
@RenDan81 
Damn This Kid can Shuffle Cards 
Awwww yeah Bahds!!!! #Sens #ottvsmtl  @Taggart7
This makes me sad because I'm an Esks fan and he was good at throwing INTs to our defence. 
@GrahamMosimann George did wonderful things with the Yankees

Con: Chiarelli has no personal ties to any current Oiler. #…
if he's closing the locker toom "sanctuary" to the media? 
@AllKindsOfClay yeah that jersey provided an additional layer of warm in the WSF last year. But I made sure it didn't touch my skin #ItBurns
@olearychris do you know if the esks have any picks in the 1st rnd this year?
Good Riddance!!! 
@Engineer_Jim @mickelhouse @JayandDanPod @JayOnrait @fs1otoole he's a smart man.

#VoteJoe in May....I won't raise your taxes...but I also won't do anything else...just like Prentice, Notley, Jean and Swann #leadersdebate
#VoteJoe 
@SnapperSnafu Well as long as they stay away from Brian Jean you won't hear Taxes again...haha
@IAmByks I'm going with Prentice and Notley...back and forth all night.
@BrianJeanWRP for got to say he wouldn't cut taxes in that commentary...did he go off script from the teleprompter?  #abpoli #leadersdebate
So far on twitter tonight I've been called an idiot, racist, sexist and asshole.  So just a regular day!
@SnapperSnafu The online thing never lies...I must do what my internet voting thing masters tell me.
I just did the online thing to help me decide whom I should vote for....apparently I should vote for the Alberta Party.... #WeAreDoomed
They've said coalition so much during the #leadersdebate I am starting to think I'm watching the new season of Survivor #ableg #abpoli
@SnapperSnafu 
@GrahamMosimann @BrianJeanWRP For the record...i'm not going to raise taxes...so you should vote JOE....
@GrahamMosimann @BrianJeanWRP I bet he raises taxes....
@SnapperSnafu i'm so confused...none of these "leaders" are making any sense...lol

@IAmByks @ginny_jenny @joeydegner @TSNAaronWard I personally enjoyed Ward when he was on the Jay and Dan Podcast when they were in Canada.
No offense...Alberta isn't ready for another female Premier...the last one kinda left a bad taste in our mouth #abpoli #leadersdebate
@IAmByks @ginny_jenny @joeydegner Fun Fact:  @TSNAaronWard hasn't blocked me yet...which I find strange since 83% of @CFLonTSN staff have.
@Morley_Scott you probably block me for saying this....but I don't think I've heard a single Billy Joel song....lol maybe one at most.
Hey @CMPunk can't wait to see you in the Octagon...I think a lot of people are underestimating you. #TeamPunk #UFC
@Morley_Scott "Wish You Were Here" is a better album than "Dark Side of the Moon"
@IGN I hope Paul Walker works out his contract issues.

@almostheavenly yeah some days i wish i wasn't human...but then i realized I would probably be killed brutally for my meat or fur.
@OpieRadio making @notsam watch "Earthlings" 
@almostheavenly When he tweeted that he watched it...i got 35 seconds in and turned it off...lol
@WMGvac to be honest...I wasn't a fan of R&amp;F mostly because of Fez...but I will probably listen to Ronnie solo

@northsidegreg maybe....maybe
@RenDan81 "I don't think @babybalaneski likes when I scream"

Me: "She better get used to it"

Renee: "Oh Shut Up!!!"
@northsidegreg it got me back on their bandwagon....till December when they are out of playoff contention again.
@WMGvac oh you don't have to leave it on....big brother is watching you all the time...
"Don't tweet that or I'll punch you in the face....quit tweeting everything I say....its annoying"

@RenDan81
@WMGvac well if you'd stop using the olive oil when you jerk off and the paper towel to clean up you wouldn't run out.
@northsidegreg I literally laughed out load watching TSN sportscentre this morning.  A whopping 2 mins of draft coverage lol
"Sidney Crosby isn't even the next Sidney Crosby" @RenDan81 after I tell her @cmcdavid97 is the next Crosby
Why do I picture this being @jyoungesp  
@EdmontonOilers @TheChrisWescott @okcbarons why ISNT this post and all your posts about McDavid?
This is the photo my phone took when it hot the floor.... #Artist 
@TheeYukonJack I think you should have a podcast....the public demands Uncensored Yuk....

No....no it won't...another bust-a-roo....lol 
Had the most fucked up dream last night...the #Oilers won the #NHLDraftLottery and will get @cmcdavid97. Thank God it was only a dream!!!
I'm outraged...@andrewhammond30 said "brain farts" on live tv...Absolutely outraged. #ThinkOfTheChildren #Language
@Fyfe4life @weirdmedicine Yeah I trust Dr. Steve more too..mostly because @WMGvac keeps him honest :P
@TorrensJonathan Okay...i'm curious...what's a dirty banana?
@IAmByks @cmcdavid97 pfffft I've been following my man , Con, for a long time. Him and I are so tight we share the same birthday. #HighFive
@HollyHollywood8 you guys can have your fancy schmancy playoffs....we got McDavid. #OilersFanLogic
@Section_O @berrysprite9 sounds like "those kinda rider fans" :P
@berrysprite9 I'm thinking you just need to buy an entire tray of beers at this point....I'm sure @Section_O would agree
Who needs defence when you got McDavid....and Hall....and Eberle....and Nuge....And Yaks.... #Oilers #McDavid #NHLDraftLottery
@missjessjack I'm doing both...hahaha I'm a fair weather fan with the best of them lol
@Section_O @berrysprite9 to be honest he barely says anything.....coherently at halftime lol
@berrysprite9 @Section_O @JonLueke @Schesbalz @GrahamMosimann meet under the score board at half time. So you'll need more than 1 beer lol.
@berrysprite9 its okay to be hardcore but not to be obnoxious....contrary to popular belief you all aren't horrible human beings lol
@berrysprite9 okay we can be friends...lol
@berrysprite9 depends....are you one of "THOSE" Rider fans? Or am I going to have to block you for being a douche....lol
Hahaha the #Oilers broke twitter
@Section_O @mavblur I'll raise you and say another 5 in a row Grey Cups for the @EdmontonEsks before the Oilers make the playoffs

Connor McDavid...the first NHL player to be a bust on purpose #Oilers #NHL #NHLDraftLottery #NextAlexandreDaigle #NextPatrikStefan
How come she doesn't have an Oilers McDavid jersey yet? 
The real winner in the #NHLDraftLottery is Jack Eichel...he won't have to come to Edmonton....although Buffalo isn't much better! #PoorJack
Holy Boats...can't wait for the #NHLDraftLottery discussion on the next @TAGGARTnTORRENS.  One happy camper...One not so happy
@IAmByks He's no Jack Eichel....

Now, who is this Connor McDavid person?
Okay I'm back on the #Oilers bandwagon....until December when they are out of the playoffs again!!!
@OpieRadio @penguins Well my shitty #Oilers got another 1st overall pick...so there's that...haha
Okay now that I'm done vibrating from the #NHLDraftLottery shock...I'm going to say the Oilers will find a way to fuck this up!!!
@KellyKoson @LouieFX The first two were amazing.  The opening scene of #2 is just Louis at his best at writing...
Hey @cmcdavid97 I don't blame you for looking depressed...I live in Edmonton and have that same expression...

@BrianBachner i've been trying to get my local comedy club...that's pretty big up here, to try and get Norton, @attell, and @Mrjimflorentine
@BrianBachner You don't know how jealous I am of you getting to see so many great comedians that come to Nashville #DownSideOfBeingCanadian
@Taggart7 Knowing Leafs management they would get #1 &amp; either trade it away or take Eichel lol Oh wait...that's Oilers management...my bad
@EdmontonEsks hahaha yeah that would be awkward...."Oh Hi Ryan...the guys at the Esks Office told me where you were!!!"
@EdmontonEsks Would it be awkward if I asked @ryanking46 if i could sit on his knee as he signed my autograph???
Mr @kevinpollak....where can I buy/see your documentary #MiseryLovesComedy ???
@weirdmedicine I actually hope it works....
I am in love with @pamelaadlon... #Louie

@JonLueke @Dave_CHED One Question...would I get to kill Ewoks in this game?
@notsam Hey Sam great morning show today...only criticism I have is none of the videos you watched were posted on @OpieandJimmy #Hornets
@2nutchuck @weirdmedicine Is that @MashUpNicole ????
@CAirlie @PaulMcD_ @ChiliMedley @abandonedpics it's kinda funny you are all back tracking now. just admit you fell for it. #fuckingrubes
@CAirlie @ChiliMedley @PaulMcD_ @abandonedpics We can only hope they are in a better place now with our Lord and Saviour....

@neon_ardizon @Section_O @JonLueke I thought I was BRUH, now I"m BRO?  Is that an improvement or step down? I'm hip with the current lingo
@neon_ardizon @Section_O @JonLueke Okay that's just vulgar...i'm reporting you for pornographic content on twitter
@Section_O @JonLueke @neon_ardizon 
@Section_O @JonLueke @neon_ardizon Yeah...just like this bruh?!?!?!
@Section_O @JonLueke @neon_ardizon Agreed....thanks for the reminder.  And the fact it took me 3 months to get that account back..haha
I would like to thank @twitter for the never ending amusement people's tweets/replies bring me.
@JonLueke @neon_ardizon Is this a 50 or 100 Point achievement?
@neon_ardizon I have a college edumication thank you very much.
@neon_ardizon  For the record, I was genuinely hurt by your comments about me being dumb and you questioning my education.
@neon_ardizon @JonLueke it's okay bruh...we understand... Party on dude!!!
@GrahamMosimann @Calgaryexpo You're also going for comfort...you'll be on your feet most of the day.
@GrahamMosimann @Calgaryexpo Have you ever been to the Edmonton or Calgary Expos?
@neon_ardizon @JonLueke Why you so buttt hurt bruh? Realized you've been had? Can't take a little ribbing Bruh
@JonLueke @neon_ardizon Most definitely bruh... FAWK YEAH #DvvvDvvv
@JonLueke @neon_ardizon These cure my boredom at work while I wait for files to load.
@JonLueke @neon_ardizon This has been my best one yet...Haven't got that many replies on one tweet ever.
@JonLueke @neon_ardizon Up to 14 on this one tweet alone!!! 5 RTs and 6 Favourites
Hey....that's not nice...I'm just sad that all those people actually died. 
@yamotha12 I actually have been to the mall when it's completely closed...it is creepy
@WMGvac I haven't watched it yet...but I'm going in with an open mind.  I mean most of the Netflix stuff has been pretty good so far.
@yamotha12 why you there so early?  Joined a Seniors mall walking group?
Thank you to @OpieRadio @JimNorton for making @JRELive happen.  Great 3 hours of radio from @joerogan @AriShaffir @TonyHinchcliffe @notsam
Officially a @TonyHinchcliffe fan now after listening to him for 1 hour.  Thanks @joerogan #JRELive
So just curious...Would @AnthonyCumia be allowed up to @HowardStern's show? @SIRIUSXM #LetHimUp
I think @BrianReganComic should sue Ruby Receptionists for their SiriusXM add...blatant ripoff
Thank you to @joerogan for calling out @SIRIUSXM on their "commercial free product" #JRELive @OpieRadio @OpieandJimmy
I'm a little unsure how I feel about @joerogan liking Toby Keith music...lol #JRELive @OpieRadio @OpieandJimmy
@SeanSmithUMass @OpieRadio @AnthonyCumia HAHAHAHA Love that his entrance music is Pearl Jam....I'm thinking it would be Elderly Woman...lol
@OpieRadio @AnthonyCumia I think you need to make a surprise appearance like a Heel wrestler would.
@weirdmedicine It's just Rogan, Ari and Sam...lol They are also trying to get Anthony up into the studio..lol
@OpieRadio Thank you for making this @joerogan Experience happen.  I hope you do more guest hosts.
@weirdmedicine I think you need to call in to O&amp;J today...so you can say you've been on Rogan's podcast...
I love @notsam but it's weird hearing him on The @joerogan Experience! You've made it to the big time Sam!!!
And here we go!!! @joerogan @AriShaffir @OpieandJimmy
@ChiliMedley @PaulMcD_ @abandonedpics Oh no...did those guys at least get on a life boat?
@JonLueke @Dave_CHED @Krepadoodle I can always be cooler!!!
@JonLueke @Dave_CHED @Krepadoodle But I want to be equally disappointed by the first 3 like the rest of you....
@Dave_CHED @JonLueke @Krepadoodle Just watched the trailer...I will probably watch it....but I should probably watch the other 6 first.
@neubian1 no more than 7 tho....its a weeknight

@OpieRadio since my shitty Oilers decided to shit the bed again this year...can I jump on your #Isles bandwagon?
@Schesbalz #Jackie42 
@travistefft I'm an #Oilers fan but might have to cheer for the Sens against your Habs!!!
@JasonGregor @ginny_jenny @GordWhitehead49 And this is why i refuse to support the Oilers. #RunByABunchOfHighSchoolKids
@Taggart7 @TorrensJonathan I think Shella murdered and buries Trevor in the bushes behind the cabin #Top5CabinJams

@weirdmedicine Hey Dr Steve...you said you had some New Parent/Baby info on your website?  I can't find it
@ginny_jenny wind = farts
@ginny_jenny its the main reason @Possiblycolby married you.
@ginny_jenny what if I just started dropping the C-bomb in every tweet?
@ginny_jenny I'm surprised you don't use that option more for my tweets
@Carpenter_Kate @ctecoupleforfun the snort laugh is the only reason I watch you on TV.
@OpieRadio is @Sherrod_Small hosting on Friday?
If Norma Bates doesn't stop crying and whining...I'm going tap out of #BatesMotel
@Section_O @JonLueke @t_dubsworld1

 I think it's more funny I couldn't see the original guys tweet cause I blocked him a long time ago
That guy in the car has anger management issues #BatesMotel

@Section_O I wish I could use that excuse more often for my tweets
@Section_O your tweet makes no sense...like the majority of mine
"@IGN: #Xmen Apocalypse: Olivia Munn will play Psylocke 
Why do people bother watching/listening to #Oilers press conferences. You just going to hear the same shit you've heard for the last 10 yrs.
Driving down the road...@RenDan81 sees a sign and says "What's CRAP supplies?" 

I look at the sign it said "CPAP Supplies"
@freshprinceofAB it means everything about me is trademarked...especially my awesomeness
@freshprinceofAB does the star next to your name mean you're verified but not famous?
@annielederman kinda reminds me of Scarlett Johansson only better because Annie's funny. #HumourIsBetterThanBoobs

@Section_O @IAmByks Baseball managers dress like they are going to bat cleanup
@IAmByks Fun Fact: A lot of them are in only their undies or nude under those coveralls...because of the heat #TheMasters
@Section_O actually I think Tiger is still the youngest by 3 months...unless CBS had their facts wrong on Friday
*Beep*
"Three wood."
#TheMasters 
@Section_O @EdmontonEsks @JonLueke @Schesbalz yeah that riders game last year there wasn't a lot of coherency
@Section_O @EdmontonEsks no no no I want you singing at halftime....during a riders game. @JonLueke &amp; @Schesbalz know what I'm talking about
@EdmontonEsks I nominate @Section_O at halftime....not before the game
This baby is not anatomical proportional #PrenatalClass 
@TheTowelBoy Tiger always throws hissy fits...he's a little baby
@Krepadoodle dont' worry...i don't like picturing myself shirtless either.
Note to self:  Don't fry bacon shirtless
The @NLL refs are about as accurate with play review as the @CFL

Well stop talking to the TV

#BombARoo #ThatJokeMakesNoSense
Okay...why the fuck would you have a "natural birth" in this day and age. Fucking weirdos!!! #PrenatalClass
Watching the baby move in @RenDan81's stomach during the videos is creepier than the videos #PrenatalClass

Haha this is exactly what @Possiblycolby said!!
I think I'm gonna get the epideral during labour...@RenDan81 can have one too #PrenatalClass
@yamotha12 grey nuns
Oh goodie...time for the birthing videos.... #PrenatalCourse
These prenatal course instructors are cruel....send you for lunch then make you watch a birthing video.
"You have to poop a head" #PrenatalClass
So much estrogen in this prenatal class...and that's not counting the pregnant women
@babybalaneski @ginny_jenny @RenDan81 no you don't...you have enough clothes already....
@Taggart7 you think Spieth will run away with it...or do you think someone will catch him? #Masters
@ginny_jenny DISCLAIMER...i accept no blame or responsibility for anything said in my tweets
@ginny_jenny we all got a little brandy on our soothers when we were her age...
@ginny_jenny what the worst that could happen? She sleeps soundly thru the night.
@ginny_jenny meh...Eva won't mind a little vino in her breast milk. Go at it!!!
@IAmByks in all honesty I love seeing empty seats at all major sporting events....especially baseball.
@IAmByks I heard the swats right behind home plate were $3000-4000 per game...but they reduced the price cause no one was being them
@IAmByks I'm a Yankees fan for the last 25 years and I laugh my ass off seeing empty seats in the new stadium
@drewbehm your bit about running up the stairs because of the monster.... Or was that the Emcee's joke?...lol
"@missjessjack: Ohhhh heyyyy @OVBeer in Alberta?!?

"We'll have the goal judge to do the 'gun finger point' thing when we score...to say 'Good Job Mate'..." #AussieRulesFootie
"Okay guys...you can only PUNCH the ball fowards" #AussieRulesFootie
The field is shaped like an oval. This is because one of the drunks tried to draw a rectangle #AussieRulesFootie
Only a drunk would decide "Okay when we throw the ball in we have to throw it in backwards over our heads" #AussieRulesFootie
I've come to the conclusion that Aussie Rules Football was invented by a bunch of drunk Australians in the parking lot after a rugby match.
@Taggart7 Is there ever "gimmie pins" at Augusta...lol

@GrahamMosimann I mean i'm all for it...love me some Nic Cage
@GrahamMosimann Just wondering....is there a reason you're doing this or just cuz?
The upside having to wait 100 mins to publish 70 drawings is I have lots of time to spam twitter.

@LonnieTheJew Every time you tweet I'm like "Who is this guy?" Then I realized I said I would follow you at Xmas haha
@HoverHand14 I unsubscribed from his show after he made some comments about the shooting in Ottawa last year.
@HoverHand14 That's still too expensive for my taste...haha
@HoverHand14 I actually think he's very witty and smart.
@HoverHand14 Yep.
@HoverHand14 Yeha I missed his show yesterday....might have to go resubscribe just to watch it.
@HoverHand14 It was perfect

@TimberKings @PioneerLogHomes
@northsidegreg agree the dynamic between Jim and Ant was priceless
"@MrTommyCampbell: #IOnceDatedSomeoneWho had never used a condom in her life. Ever. #TrueStory"

Then you married her?
@northsidegreg in all honesty I like opies show more now that I did o&amp;a the last fee years. Better guests. Different dynamic.
@northsidegreg yeah...but like Opie said...they grew apart outside the show.  Married live vs bachelor live...
@fs1otoole can I meet you somewhere in #yeg and bring @JayOnrait's "Anchorboy" to sign. Got his and @Taggart7 'Hancocks' in it already.
@northsidegreg I hope this is just a bit like fez retiring....
@northsidegreg maybe its a good thing Ant got fired...the show probably wouldn't have lasted if he ststayed on.
@Jeff_the_Giant BTW...thanks to your avatar...I read all your tweets in Bill Murray's Caddyshack voice
@fs1otoole wait right there....I want to come get your autograph and pic
@MrTommyCampbell You still have that catheter attached?
@almostheavenly Don't feel bad about your Brewers...my Yankees shit the bed today too...

@Krepadoodle @JonLueke did I just read he's getting deported? WTF?
@OpieRadio have you watched @Trevornoah's doc "You Laugh But It's True".  I didn't know his mom got shot while they were filming

@almostheavenly GO YANKEES GO!!!
Watching @Trevornoah's documentary #Netflix.  Amazing story.  Fuck all the haters!!!
Let's all remember the true meaning of #Easter. Some guy died for our sins so we could bite the heads of chocolate shaped animals.
@Section_O @BCLionsDen Not sure what version they are using
@Section_O Yeah it's pretty good for a free program.  @BCLionsDen said they use a program called Pamela For Skype to take calls.  v
@Breebabee WTF is @Krepadoodle forcing you to watch...sounds cheesy
@Section_O then export that single track so you can then save it as your INTRO track, then all you have to do is import it every time.
@Section_O yep...then just import that mp3 to audacity and clip out what you want.  you can start a new track, paste it in there.
@Jeff_the_Giant lol yeah me too... been a fan since 1988...lol  Those BC ones are wussies
@JasonGregor kinda looks like @GeorgesStPierre in glasses...kinda.... #NLL #Rush #RushNation

I will never get tired of watching @markmatthews222 use that swim move over and over... #BeastMode #NLL #RushNation @TheEdmontonRush
@Section_O edit the track anyway you want, and there are Fade In/Fade Out effects under the EFFECTS menu
@Section_O I don't think you can import straight from iTunes...but if you have an MP3 file you can bring it in using the import function,
@Section_O you can also have multiple tracks...and then just export it as a single audio file at the end.
@Section_O there's also a selection tool (thing that looks like an I on top) you can then use copy paste like any software.
@Section_O for #2 if you have an audio file created (ie Mp3) you can import that too then use the TIME SHIFT TOOL double arrow symbol on top
@Section_O for #1...go to FILE ==&gt; IMPORT ==&gt; AUDIO for intro music
@Section_O took me a while to get used to the features in Audacity

@AnthonyCumia @OpieRadio I say both....make people subscribe to @TheCumiaShow get the conclusion to the 10am cliffhanger on @OpieandJimmy
Awww yeah @JasonGregor is on my TV... #RushNation @TheEdmontonRush #NLL #EDMvsVAN #RushVsStealth
@OpieRadio happy easter Op to you and your family!
@IAmByks here's a pic of his pants 
@Section_O The @BCLionsDen guys might be able to help out too...
@Section_O  you'd need to get a splitter which could effect quality and track mixing harder.
@Section_O They might be able to give you more insight. I would think if you want more than 2 mics,
@Section_O I bought my stuff at Long &amp; McQuade.  The guy there said a lot of people come in to buy podcast stuff now.
@OpieRadio Well done Hudson!!! #GarfieldRules
@Section_O what kind of mixer did you get?
@MentalityMag I think my grandma has that same lamp
@Section_O My mics connect straight to my mixer with actual mic cords....better sound.
oh YouTube you silly bitch...now I'm in a @jimmycarr loop


Holy fuck...just watched @jessejoyce's "Fuck Babies" bit on @attell's Comedy Underground show. #Amazing #TearsInMyEyes #LaughingTooHard
cause the first backup crashed during it.  #FuckYouApple
Just wasted 30mins researching why my wife's iphone wouldn't turn on and then another 60 mins backing it up
A day doesn't go by where I regret switching to a Samsung from an iPhone.
@JasonGregor Doesn't make their offense onsided like in previous years
@JasonGregor He's a beast of a man.  I think it also helps him having guys like Greer and McIntosh to take pressure off him.
@JasonGregor he is proving to become one of the all-time greats in the league.  If he can stay healthy he will dominate the league for years
HOORAY FOR SPAMMING ONLINE VOTING!!! #PearlJam #YellowLedbetter @X929 #RidersSuck

@Dave_CHED @JasonGregor He's also got some use as a backup return guy too.
@NLL @TheEdmontonRush They are so super awesome they broke the picture link!!!
@RiderColin @calstampeders So all I can ask is why did he block me #AskCornish
@RiderColin @calstampeders I personally think he's the best RB in the league..if not of the best of all time...and I'm a fuckin' Esks fan.
@RiderColin @calstampeders He then gave some "haters gonna hate" reply and then blocked me.
@RiderColin @calstampeders  I said he didn't deserve to win the MOP after only playing a half a season
@RiderColin @calstampeders I never once criticized him until he didn't like when a Stamps fan replied to me when
@calstampeders How come you're not answering my first question Jon??? #AskCornish
@calstampeders Why'd you block me Jon? #AskCornish
@rickygervais I better not cry again like I have during both seasons of #Derek #CurseYouAndYourAmazingWriting

@GrahamMosimann "Here you see the Big Mac with Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun"
@BrianBachner @MentalityMag this scientific experiment has me come to the conclusion that Brian LOVES blonds
@GrahamMosimann I own about 85% of his BBC documentaries.
@GrahamMosimann the day he dies i will honestly cry. He makes nature documentaries much more interesting.
@GrahamMosimann is David Attenborough of BBC Nature narrating it?
@GrahamMosimann is it because it reminds you of when you have sex? #Sorry #EarlyMorningMeanJoeTweet
@notsam since people request songs for the intro to the main show....I'm requesting "High Ball Stepper" for the start of the pre-show

@jessejoyce great to hear you on @OpieandJimmy today. Loved the WWII bat story. Hope you come back to @ComicStripWEM
@Dave_CHED sucks he has to retire so young and under those circumstances
Last time I fuckin' checked my official job description didn't say project manager!  I fuckin' hate lazy people!

@Schesbalz Can you please email me your babysitting resume?
@Dave_CHED You're not a Pats fan...you're a Brady fan.
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 Jay was friendly and talked with everyone of his fans...it was great. Most comics don't do that.
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 And it was right after Ant got fired...and he said "Op is gonna have to keep selling those shirts"...lol
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 Agreed.  I was wearing my @OpieRadio Slobbo shirt when I met him.
Currently seeking babysitters for my unborn child so I can go see @DanSoder @ComicStripWEM in July.  #NewParentProblems
@BrianBachner He was in top form when we saw him. My wife didn't know how he was..and instantly loved his style.
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 Rogan and Regan are in that list too
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 I would agree with that. Burr was my #1 till I saw Jefferies a couple weeks ago.
@yamotha12 @amyschumer i had to get River Cree to refund me because of the rescheduling...we can't make it tonight #SadFace
@EdmontonEsks Hahaha he used to teach me Drama and English in high school...lol #ABJAlumni Loved his Esks stories
@yamotha12 @jaymohr37 Maybe @NikkiGlaser is stilling all of Jay's customers for Thursday night... #OhShit #BattleOfTheBlondes
@yamotha12 @jaymohr37 But he wouldn't be able to play the River Cree again cause of their shitty venue being close for engineering issues
@BrianBachner @jaymohr37 Jay was definitely one of my favourite shows I've seen in the last few years. Up there with Burr and Jefferies!

@Krepadoodle @Dave_CHED I can show you another finger slip if you want?
@CBCEdmonton They know it's a movie right?
@IanSharek @Dave_CHED I don't disagree with that...but you can't have that possible drama in the locker room.
@Dave_CHED @IanSharek Sheets won't at second fiddle to Cornish. I also don't think they like each other too much. #RumourHasIt
@Dave_CHED @IanSharek Calgary has Cornish and Walter...best in the league with a decent backup
@Dave_CHED all the other teams have solid backfields. He might be able to provide pass protection for Lulay too
@Dave_CHED where do you see Sheets ending up? For some reason I see him in a BC Lions jersey

@Dave_CHED @JonLueke @EdmontonEsks I beg to differ...I find I have to be more creative with the spam tweets in the off season.
@GrahamMosimann To which he replied "You fucker I got a second show after this!!!"...lol
@GrahamMosimann Yeah he came out with one drink in ours...and was visible buzzed...then his opener handed him a second one.
@GrahamMosimann @Musgrooove @jimjefferies okay I fucking jealous now...we went to the early show &amp; he didn't have time to take pics with us

@JonLueke @Schesbalz So you need to use water to get it?...lol I'm so confused. I'm thinking Dana spilled her beer and ruined the box.
@JonLueke @Schesbalz so the box is intentionally got water damage?
@ExtraLars @ComicStripWEM @domirrera I think my wife would kill me, then divorce me, if I dragged her to 3 comedy shows in 3 days...hahahaa

@Section_O @adamferrara you should have come to see Adam....much more entertaining and probably cheaper...
I've come to the conclusion that comedy in March in Edmonton rules.  Got @amyschumer in a couple weeks to finish it strong.
