@WammyGiveaway those sound good. @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway That's OK I guess, it gives the Mortal Kombat Fatality vibe with unique complicated commands per character. @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway I remember X-Men COTA very user friendly with shotoclone motions, with Spiral's HCB move as the "hardest". @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway Examples? half circle motions are fine. @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway HCB/HCF x2 are tricky, but I pull them more often than 360 or 720 motions. @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway I didn't find much issue with KOF motions, but I'm not too lucky with full circle rotations. @ScrollBoss
@WammyGiveaway It can be disconcerting to new players; may be confusing to memorize many motions when trying each character. @ScrollBoss

@Paige_Six I've heard about this DC creator ruckus. If Stan Lee cameos in any Marvel movie, chances are he's one of the creators.
@Paige_Six the movies have a different continuity. Agent Carter series had the 1st Black Widow Yelena Belova, who is 2nd BW in the comics.
@Paige_Six Who knows if Charlize would be in the MCU in the future. :D
@Paige_Six The movies had BW born 1984. Comics Natasha was almost the same age as Cap with a deaging serum iirc.
@Paige_Six IMO Scarlett was a great BW ever since, but this time the Bruce/Nat subplot felt shoehorned and quite off left field.
@Paige_Six I think Olsen got the German/Russian accent better than Taylor-Johnson. I agree about BW's lack of Russian accent.
