It is going to be a fearce battle to make the Raiders roster as a WR. Feels great to say that.
@calicesar thank you haha
K done. No more deflategate memes. Enjoy.






Couple more then, no more deflategate stuff.
Lmfao 
#RaiderNation lets all go vote for OBJ over Gronk for the Madden cover. We dont need another cheating Pat on the cover.
For real tho, If you set up a go fund me account for a billionaire, you're an idiot.


Ok, im out for now. Have a blessed day #RaiderNation




Ok have a few more.
@LAKEdwards @Alshara47 @nfl aww look a foursome.
Ok done for now. Hope yall enjoyed.
@rubicon202 haha I know what ya meant bro. Me either.


Legit Donkey fans here. 
@rubicon202 haha





Ok I got a few more coming hang on.





Would be nice for the Raiders to have all their draft picks locked up by next week.

Terrelle Pryor was suspended 5 FUCKIN GAMES for something he did with his OWN property... DUR…

I am a Clippers fan but, I like great basketball. I want nothing more than a Dubs- Clips Western Finals.
@MsAutumnWind fucking morons. paying for a cheating team who has billions. Idiots.
Tom cheats a lot
Patriot fans crying
Four tainted rings.

 my haiku
@BrandonK00 @MsAutumnWind nope, just skipped.
@BrandonK00 they lose it
Texans waived SS D.J. Swearinger ... Interesting

Giving him 4 extra weeks to plan the next way he's going to cheat.

@JohnMiddlekauff gooddell said it before, "ignorance is not an excuse"
@Borsilli good it is about tine
Patriots released CB Kyle Arrington... Run, dont walk to the Waiver wire to snag this guy.
Happy mothers day to all the mothers out there. Thanks for all you do!
Lol 
Yikes, rookies need to stay healthy. 
@sickmanuel @MacRaider_187 never heard of her.
@Nbell3 if Brady lobbied for the rule change, got it, and has been doing this (pats yearly fumble rate best in NFL) since then... Well..
@damienwoody you deserve one. All of #RaiderNation hopes for a speedy recovery for Mr. Fowler.
Remember @nflcommish , "ignorance is not an excuse". Do the right thing, suspend Brady, Belicheck, fine the Pats, take draft picks. #Justice
Damn, @Jaguars fans. I am sorry, that sucks. You dont deserve this. Hope he heals quickly.
@ESPNNFL 
@Jaguars hope Fowler is ok, from the #RaiderNation
Damn that sucks. Hope Fowler is ok. @sic187one  
Doesnt this offseason feel different? Every offseason we are hopeful, this one feels optimistic. Am I the only one who feels that way?

Chicago is on to the Conference Finals for 5th time in last 7 years. 
@francisco932024 @mnwild @mnwildPR @NHLBlackhawks lol GO HAWKS
Hell yeah, Blackhawks MOVING ON!
@BrownsFanProbs @RAIDERS you mean bust like these guys? 
@billycrossover 
When you see a Niners fan. 
Those of you still upset over releasing James Jones. i got you. 
@donaldday0129 haha no worries, bro. Thanks!
@MsAutumnWind well Raiders do have 2 players from Fresno
@donaldday0129 oh, yeah I meant our draft picks <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@donaldday0129 who?
Cant wait to hear all the Raiders draft picks are signed.
With the Collins signing, i wonder if LG Ronald Leary gets pissed and they release him. If so would be a legit signing for Raiders.
Too soon? 
@RawSports365 agreed
That feeling when leg day got you walking like bambi.
@RawSports365 no. That is the highest offer an udfa can get. Sadly

Tom we are gonna need to see your phone... 
@brwneyes1979 anytime. #raiderFam

FAV for NO

#DeflateGate 
Legit. 
We know Tom, quit being creepy about it tho. 
Good one Tom. 
Who did this... 



Why does Lester Hudson not get more pt on the Clips? Dude can play
Looks like Collins is off the hook. Let the schmoozing begin 
And another one.... 
Spygate, deflategate, tuck rule. Congrats on those tainted championships. @Patriots
@TelferAlex @JasonLaCanfora nah, texts and phone calls to "the deflater" too. Tom lied and said he did not even know.
@Wagsfam2 he will. Rembember bounty gate? Ignorance is not an excuse.
@Wagsfam2 i dont think so this time. Not with those texts. Brady lied saying he did not even know ball boy. Text and called him
@Nbell3 nah those texts and tom's responses are more than enough. Bought the dude, kicks, tix, signed his 50k pass yd ball.
Bottom line, Pats cheated. It was masterminded by Brady. Bought the dude shoes, signed balls, game tix ect.
It would be about damn time. 
Yeah, sadly he has come down with a bad case of foot-in-mouth disease. 
McCoy is not a very smart person.
@Dr3b1n983 @RawSports365 @IMAR8IDER White boy here but, Horchata is a drink, w/ rice, milk cinnamon, vanilla. And it is delicious

- @JamieDukes LIVE on @NFLTotalAccess right now! 
@MattCarbonaro no doubt
Ricky bobby gonna b mad 
@BHTruth @Linebacker41 jones was the Phillip Wheeler of a couple yrs back. Shined because the rest were so bad.
@BYS1981 @OptimumScouting yup
@raider_texas i was hoping we signed him before this tweet.now i hope we pass lol

Patriots waived CB Alfonzo Dennard, worth a look for the Raiders?
@MilesBurris thanks for your years as part of the #RaiderNation. good luck in the future!
Twitter is amazing when you think of it. How else would a normal guy be able to have a convo with an NFL player? Just awesome.
@Terrell_noOwens it is a dream of millions. You are blessed. I speak for all the #RaiderNation, make us proud!!
@GdaRAIDER408 @Prince_Julius21 @ericlindsey46 bergs is a ZBS OG.The yr they drafted him Raiders ranZBS, then went away from it the yr after
@Terrell_noOwens stay humble my man. But, really your life has changed, you are a professional now. Can't wait 2 c u on the field.
@LakersRaiders23 @RAIDERS heck Raiders did not even pick 2nd this year, and From what I have seen Raiders got better.... Haters gonna hate
@LisaLease007 Just smile and ask, when does the Laker game come on?
@WyomingRaider Cheers bro.
@mbend22 @WyomingRaider oh I agree. I guess im just nit picking and want some cb depth is all.
Jones, Burris, Boothe cut. Just enough dough to saved to sign our whole draft class.
@USNFeatherman yeah, im not askin for revis but a nice June cut Cb would be advised. Just my opinion tho
@USNFeatherman and he hired the last dud of a HC. DJR gets 3-4 yrs. They will make a change next yr if no improvement.
@USNFeatherman year 4 for RM tho...
@USNFeatherman RM should care. Another season like last year he gets the axe.not a SB team at all but one injury 2 a cb, competitive is gone
@e28raider barnes got an extention this off-season. He is cheap and plays many spots. Sadly he stays.
@USNFeatherman honestly, i hope they dont. That gamble puts the whole season at risk. No depth at all behind them, in a passing league. Ouch
Raiders still need a few CBs, and IMO an edge rusher. CB biggest need tho.
Lol wtf... Last yr was one of the best drafts  in 15 yrs. Smh. 
@primetimeRYNE agreed.
Lol 
@primetimeRYNE he was
@nickhjeltness yup
YESSSSSS!!!Burris is GONE. GOOD LUCK IN HIS LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL THO.
Only positions i have Questions about are: DB, RB, and missing a pass rusher.
#Raide…

2014 Rd 1 Pick #4 (Watkins) 4 yr $19.935M fully guarant'd, $12…
Honestly, we should be happy abput Jones' release. Goes to show how much depth we have got in one offseason.
Good luck to James Jones. 31Yrs old, Cooper, Streeter, Crabs,the young bucks will get it done.
@WyomingRaider @RandiHarbaugh haha
@RandiHarbaugh @WyomingRaider k video then. We are not picky.
@WyomingRaider @RandiHarbaugh agreed haha
@RandiHarbaugh true, but months away :(
Not gonna lie, i miss the draft hype. Now what is the next foorball event we have to look forward to?

•Tedy Bruschi -  @nyjets 
•Herm Edwards - @RAIDERS 
•Mel Kiper - @Ravens 
•Todd McShay - @Jagu…
@BHTruth answer, no one, she has already done all in Hollywood. Lol
@Dex_Mac welcome to the ONLYnation. The #RaiderNation.
@StrongIsland666 yup, LB, WR, TE, and O-Line all gonna be heated battles
First time in a long time we get to say this but, it is going to be very tough to make the Raiders as a WR.
Im gonna guess La'el collins stays in New Orleans and signs with the Saints.
@MrOakTown55 10 new teammates for ya. And a few more UDFA's you guys get to haze.. I mean teach haha
@yosoyricki @CraziestSex fo sho. #RaiderFam
@yosoyricki @CraziestSex haha im not a huge boxing guy but, floyd always does this. Every fight. But, we agree Fuck Bieber lol
I dont care who ya are. This is funny. 
@yosoyricki lol not even close.
@A_Flawed_King im a floyd fan. I am just real. He runs, jabs, runs. Effictive but, boring.
@A_Flawed_King floyd one of tge best technical fighters ever. But, lets be real EVERY fight he does is boring.
Just like every other Floyd fight. He wins, just like i knew he would. Folyd's style is why boxing is dead tho. May&gt;Pac hands down.
@FabioSolanilla this is just like ALL other Floyd fights. Pac fell right in his trap.
@FabioSolanilla boxing been dead 4 years.
Floyd boring, but winning. Proving he is a better fighter.
Pac will need a knockdown/knockout to beat May at this point.
THIS is how to watch the fight. 127' HD Theater Raiders room. #MayPac

@Dex_Mac Welcome to the ONLY nation. The #RaiderNation. Can't wait to see you on the field.

@BnsAlberto @j_sharps97 Just to be clear I could care less who wins. Money grab from both imo at their ages.
@BnsAlberto @j_sharps97 That both of them lead life stylesWe don't.Pic is misleading. Plenty of douches go to church All celebs flaunt money
@j_sharps97 @BnsAlberto Let's not kid ourselves, they both have way too much money.
If anyone finds a live stream to the may vs pac fight please dm me. thanks
Terrell Pinson LB Louisana Tech, Josh Harper Fresno St. UDFA thus far.…

Seems #NFLNetwork agrees. 
Incredible lack of …
@cassyymaynee @ElijahJoeJune haha yeah life is a trip.
@ElijahJoeJune haha nah, im happy we picked him. Dude can play. Just wanted a few ppl to get pissed lol
@AliGuitron stir*
@AliGuitron duh lol it is to stip the pot haha
@ElijahJoeJune i know, it is a joke lol trying to stir up ppl
Then keep your ass in KC, undrafted. 
#MayweatherPacquiao will not get one nickle outta me. #Greedy
Lets recap, Raiders got 2 DE'S, 2LB'ers, Best WR, KR, (imo) BEST TE, OG, OT, CB. Problem?
@Nbell3 no reason to be sorry, I hope we sign him as an UDFA.
Raiders have long needed an explosive return man. We have that now.
Debose will be our new returner.
OT Anthony Morris is the pick.
Raiders up!
@raiderva drafted two DE's (Max is DE), OG, WR, TE. Then LB depth. Need Cb's w last 2 pick. No complaints here
I have no rooting interest in the boxing match tonight. If i had to pick one tho i think Mayweather wins. Not a fan but, i think he wins.
Florida St.  9
Miami (FL)  6

@nflnetwork #cooper
@nflnetwork cooper
@mbend22 If one can play Safety it makes the draft better. A++ is a lil too high tho. I like this draft, not blind tho lol
@peteraiders LMAO
Scouts take:He's an athlete and not a football player right now.If it starts to click for him, look out, buddy.If not you've got a backup DE
@USNFeatherman humm, could be interesting.
@saynt614 yeah have to. crazy amount of LB'ers lol
Jags got Bennett
Valles is a freak athlete and ran a 4.43 at Pro Day. He has gotten better each year in college. Intriguing pick. His write up.
Raiders going to a 3-4?
ANOTHER FUCKING LB? pardon my french but really?
@luketheduke0713 @nflnetwork so lame. We need our new @RAIDERS twitter guy to slep them around
Of course @nflnetwork goes to commercial when the RAIDERS pick again. WTF
@IMdaHNIC716 i know what ya meant bro haha
@IMdaHNIC716 agreed.
@DondiRaider I think that is the plan. or move to 3-4. doubt the 3-4 tho.
Ok now Bennett? Ifo?Derron? maybe lol
@BYS1981 haha well played
The #Raiders now have 11 LB'ers on the roster with these two draft picks.

@Cali4NiARaZeD no got this pick from trading down.
Ben Heeney gf. Wowza. 
@ROLLINRAIDER @Sara_0119 thanks brotha
#RaiderNation do me a favor and follow my wife @Sara_0119. She wants to see why I am always on Twitter.

#RockChalk 

Ben Heeney.....
Bennett or Ajayi
Wait Ajayai is still on the board?????????
Bennett or Cobb on this next pick please.
@el_duderino8184 yup. We got two 5th's. I say we take a shot on him!
@9Ra1der6 haha yeah
@nflnetwork really... EVERY pick of the RAIDERS has been at commercial. Stop it. 
@9Ra1der6 we took an OG bro
Well #RaiderNation we got our new OG.
Why do I get this feeling RM is collecting picks to trade for Evan Mathis or something.
Bennett should be the pick imo
@ElijahJoeJune cheers, no worries bro.
@MsAutumnWind @ElijahJoeJune no, we have a 4th.. 1 pick away right now lol
@MsAutumnWind Raiders up in 2 picks now
@Silkyjohnson90 @JO310JO UGLY
@AContizano Well, I learned a long time ago. You can't fix stupid. I kid I kid.
@AContizano Damn, Tim blocking you has you that bummed? lol
Mellissa Stark is nice.
@x81Raider75x sad face lol
And, gone.
Love the Gabe Wright pick for the Lions.
OG's flying off the board. Still one I want but, Im not gonna name him and jinx it lol
Dang, Pats picked Tre' Jackson :/
HIS NAME IS RUUUUSSSS haha. In the NFL background.
@AContizano @timkawakami no clue lol. I dont think I said much. He must have paper thin skin if he blocked me.
If the Raiders want Tre' Jackson they are going to have to trade in front of Philly.
@AContizano @timkawakami I am blocked too. He is a tool bag. oh well lol
@Raiders24dude @caplannfl lol yeah. Maybe he has not had his second cup o joe yet.
@caplannfl *Panthers
trade!!
@MrOakTown55 Happy Birthday Sio. Thanks for all you do for the ONLY nation. Have a great day!

@sic187one 
@MikeMolinero @JT_Raider looks like maybe a late round gem. We will see!
@MikeMolinero @JT_Raider I will check him out. Honestly not 100% familiar with him.
@MattCarbonaro I 100% want Jackson!
@JT_Raider Not a waisted pick imo. The need is still there tho. Mathias Kiwanuka, Anthony Spencer, OSI. Still vets available.
Yo, if you are #RaiderNation and I am not following you, hit me up. If you follow me I follow back. Unless you are Ricky Bobby lol.
@LusterM42 OG the biggest need honestly. After that, yeah all D.
@LusterM42 I like him as well.
Welp, unless the Vikes take a crazy lowball deal AP will be a Vike.
@JT_Raider I did not LOVE the Mario pick, did not hate it either. Dude is a run stuffing DE. Still need a legit pass rusher.
Jarrett, Bennett, Ajaji, Jackson, Flowers, Clemmings... all studs left.
@RaidersD no doubt but, honestly.... It will not be close.
@OGSlick_46 Welcome to the ONLY nation. The #RaiderNation . Can't wait to see you with @derekcarrqb
@RaidersD Walford 3x's the athlete that Rivera is. Just being honest.
Shit, or Trey Flowers. Good picks left!!
I wanted Tre' Jackson in the 3rd. Hope we can land him in the 4th!!! #Steal
@deathgrxps still hurt. still available.
lol 
@Central_NFL Darren McFadden*
bahahah get some cold cuts get some cold cut
@9Ra1der6 @Cali4NiARaZeD he straight up skipped his meeting with the Raiders.
Hate to say it but, the Charger have made 2 very nice picks.
lmao @49ers great pick, kind of tart and bitter tho bahaha
@RaiderN8ionSam Big difference. Mack a rookie getting double teamed. Love Tuck but, his double digit sack days r gone.
@RaiderN8ionSam 5.. yes 5 sacks all year bro,. Love him but, his days being a dominate pass rusher are gone.
Hell maybe Raiders get lucky and Gregory falls to the 3rd? haha
I like Edwards as a run stuffer but.... Who besides Mack is gonna be a pass rusher?
Round 2! Fight! haha
Hoping for Preston Smith, Landon Collins, Gregory or trade for Wilkerson.
@itsOpeningDay haha i caught it two years ago. Like wtf
@itsOpeningDay happens every year broham.
@957thegame @49ers @MaioccoCSN @DamonBruce 
@PFF Loves @AmariCooper9 
@SamwiseJohngee Yup, looks like the @RAIDERS  survey get us a new twitter guy. And he.is.awesome!
This. @RAIDERS get a new sound guy please, oh and make sure he knows WTH is going on, or at least the player's name. 
Damn, I have 2 jerseys I have to buy still. Cooper, and Mack. I am slackin
Thank you! WTF, umm what is his name? Amari? Pathetic. 
Cooper will wear #19.
Really.. One of the reporters juat said plain as day, what is his name Amari? Pff. You have one job reporter.
@RAIDERS @AmariCooper9 turn up Amari's mic plz.
@RAIDERS turn up Cooper's mic please on the PC.
Sadly, time to hang em up. 
Whoa, two smiles?? haha 
See he does smile. 
@des_bah mmm Boobies!!!
@MikeMolinero hahahaha
awesome 
@MrPapagiorgio90 haha yeah dude is a hug douche. Wish he would just a ring already for Hue. #IfYouLoveItThenYouShouldPutARingOnIt
Getting some love from 
Eagles fans after they could not get Mariota. #MadAsHell haha @sic187one  
Sick 
@StrongIsland666 Yup, So down with that.
@StrongIsland666 That is why I said "dream scenario" it is a dream lol
@RaiderNationRon @RAIDERS Yup, Ima do a shot of 100 proof Capt. Gross I know. But gotta made sure it hurts so good.
@donaldday0129 I hear ya but, With 75 mill they can fit all 3 no prob.
This. Ill do a shot with ya! 
@donaldday0129 correction. 75 mill 
@donaldday0129 as of now, next year Raiders have 100 mill in available cap space. I think we good
@donaldday0129 High Salary, and now with Williams their line has too many players getting paid to much. Yes, it's a pipe dream lol
@StrongIsland666 i want a Lambo. Aint gonna happen tho haha
@TheAlpacaSmacka Wiz was a great OG, always got pushed around at C tho. Loved his legacy more than his play.
For Wilkerson, and draft Best OG avail in third.
My dream Scenario,Raiders trade down 6 spots. Pick up and Extra 3rd,Draft Goldman in 2nd. Trade our first 3rd rounder to the Jets cont..
@TheAlpacaSmacka Agreed. If you love him wait till you see Hudson in S&amp;B. Dude is a monster!
@TheAlpacaSmacka down with that. Jackson was a steal in the 3rd last year!
@TomG11_ He is the same runner and has the same upright running style as McFadden. Chicken legs too. I love Goldman tho.
Would Winston or Mariota be #1-2 in last year's draft? I don't think so.
@MsAutumnWind @957thegame anytime!
@TomG11_ nah, they already had him. His name was Mcfadden.
@MsAutumnWind @957thegame not sure, but it will be on 
@WillPrado1 story of my life bro
@TheAlpacaSmacka agreed. 4Th or later is fine. 2nd and 3rd need to be pass rusher and OG. Imo
@Linebacker41 i hope so. Just not too far down.
@MsAutumnWind 3pm pacific time
MLB is not a huge need with Lofton signed. Pass on early MLBs.
@NickC941 just*
@NickC941 Raider's Offense juat got a whole lot better.
Why? His tape is McFadden pt 2 
@WORIDSTARHIPH0P @RealSportsTaIk if by <FIRE> you mean <PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL> then I agree.
Last one for now. 
S/O to hoes everywhere. 
Lol 

K done for a bit. Thanks @redbull for giving me winds to get all them memes out. Peace.
Seems legit 






Lol 
For real tho, ima be tweeting crazy stuff today.

there are days I would rather take an ass whipping than go into a Wal-Mart.
@x81Raider75x round 3-4 yes
@ElijahJoeJune @JohnMiddlekauff lol puff puff pass.
Ima go out on a limb and say, day 2 trades will be plentiful. Will b what the "experts" thought round 1 would be.
@MrOakTown55 you the real mvp. Thanks for giving back to the children yesterday. #ClassAct
I forgot Goldman is still available. Would not mind him at all. 
For the next hour ignore my crazy tweets. This Red bull bout to get me amped. 
@raider707nation agreed but damn they would b fun to watch
@raider707nation mizzu. Google his highlights. 6'6 215 lb WR. Of course off the field probs has caused him to slip
@raider707nation Dorian Green Beckham. Dude has unreal talent.
@SamwiseJohngee yup all sound good to me.
@Elias_Trejo impressive. Greg, jelly, williams, tuck. Mack, lofton, sio. Watch out.
I still am laughing at the thought of DGB on one side, Cooper on the other, Crabs/Jones in the slot. Yikes.
@AmariCooper9 welcome to the ONLY nation. The #RaiderNation .
The Rock has no chill. 
A month ago if you said Raiders could end up with Cooper and Gregory l, i wouldhave asked how many draft picks did Raiders have to give up
@MacRaider_187 lol yeah. No crying here tho. Love the Cooper pick. Plenty of great talent left.
In case you dont know about Preston Smith... 
@RaiderMoeJoe @RAIDERS no worries lol it got me at first too.
@Rone712 nada
@RaiderMoeJoe @RAIDERS it was a joke lol. They were Trolling the niners.
@BrianMejiaNFL @RawSports365 in a heartbeat
I can honestly see tge Raiders trading down a tad in the second and then moving back into the late second to grab someone.
Fun fact: The Oakland Raiders now have 7 first round picks on their roster.
@bigjdub72 ditto.
I think if he is there Raiders should take Gregory.
@primetimeRYNE yes! Big fan of his as well.
@primetimeRYNE yeah. I dont think they go DGB yet either but, coop and DGB would be nasty.
@primetimeRYNE gotta look at Collins, Gregory, and DGB.
@RAIDERS no thanks, looks like the Saints.
@ShivFrost dorial green beckham freak WR with Moss talent. But, a knucklehead.
I know we need a DE but part of me wants to see the Raiders say fuck it.... And draft DGB. Unleash Carr with bad ass weapons.
Pothead Ray eh?
Bronchoes please draft a QB so I can laugh at you.
@MsAutumnWind obviously you live in Canada :P
@MsAutumnWind If you live in the Bay area you do..
bahahahaha Terrible pick for the Whinners.
@primetimeRYNE ?
Great pick by the Chargers.
Good Pick Browns.
@EMPIRESHARK hell yes
@ROLLINRAIDER agreed
@primetimeRYNE haha
It is a tremendous pick.
@primetimeRYNE dont be bro. Cooper was a GREAT pick. someone is gonna slide to us iN ROUND 2.
Jets will be trading one of their DE's now.. watch.
Sooo stoked!!! Got a new toy for @derekcarrqb
Jags picked Fowler
we r up
WOOOO HOOO WE GET OUR PICK, wILLIAMS OR cOOPER!!!!
THE DRAMA, STARTS....NOW!
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSS
@SpuraiderL u?
@SpuraiderL williams-cooper and dgb and edwards .. Im good either way bro
RAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIDERS 
RAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIDERS 
RAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIDERS 
RAAAAAAAA…
Raiders, just don't fuck it up. Thanks.
@OllieUKEZ idiots.
@Calirocker83 cheers brother. #RaiderNation
@Calirocker83 love Fowler, Williams, cooper, and White. After that, it starts to decline
Not sure what everyone sees in Dupree. Tweener. Does not fit a 4-3, and is underwhelming. Not a Beasley guy either.
@NickC941 neither, leonard Williams.
Want to experence Deja vu? Go watch Tevin Coleman highlights, then watch Mcfadden Highlights in college. Same player
@Prince_Julius21 yikes, imo too high. I dunno shit tho haha
@Prince_Julius21 true but, his off the field stuff makes me think he is very late first-early second rounder.
@Prince_Julius21 i think 19th is too early for Dgb. At 19 i would snag Melvin Gordon tho
@Prince_Julius21 if we go williams in the first and he is there in the 2nd. Dont walk, run that card up to pick him.
@ShivFrost best fans in football bro
@Prince_Julius21 haha that would be fine.  2 1sts then hell yes
@Prince_Julius21 i think past 8th is too far. Juat my opinion.
@Prince_Julius21 yup, just not too far.
@Prince_Julius21 i think either way Raiders are getting one hell of a player.
@Prince_Julius21 i can dig that. Like like williams and cooper.
Lmfao. 
@CallMe_P bahahahaha agreed. Awesome
Ok #RaiderNation assume Everyone is available at #4, who is YOUR pick?
@ROLLINRAIDER shit none of us know shit haha that is what makes this so fun.
@CallMe_P yup. U know we r huge Raiders fans but, this year I wanna b a fly on the wall in the Eagles draft room lol
@CallMe_P agreed bro. I wouod love to be in a few teams draft rooms today tho haha
@ROLLINRAIDER hope ur right. We dont need to give up picks for 30 yr old hbs. Just a feeling
Why do I have this feeling the Raiders are gonna trade for AP? No sources n shit but, just a feeling.
DRAFT DAY FAM!!
TE  class this year sucks,i would not mind the Raiders trading a late pick for M. bennett.
@ElijahJoeJune prob bs but, who knows lol
@ElijahJoeJune heard Falcons want to trade up with Raiders

(via @whitesox) 
The next 24 hrs of draft rumors/ chatter are going to be unbearable.
One more day till the draft!!!
Not much to talk about that has not been said about the draft already. Raiders will draft Williams, Fowler, Cooper, White or trade down.
@MALOBILL shit they give us Wilkerson and a third. We would swap picks in a heartbeat.
Lol 


In the midst of such tragedy, let us be grateful for every waking moment and never take life for grant…
Destroy your own city to "protest" BRILLIANT. Smh
Shane Ray, you sir, are an idiot.
I think I am drinking the koolaid too much. Is it me or does this team (with a solid draft of course), feel like it will compete?
Ok base on nickname im sold on 2 draft pick... King Kupa (cooper) or the law office of Williams and Williams (Williams, duh).
Finally, draft week is here.
Grillin action. 
Best game of the playoffs so far. Awesome game. Followed by the Warriors game IMO
@milorider OMG Bucs win.... Inbound to a lay up. Game ova
@milorider Bucks ball second left. Time out bucks
@milorider 38 secs left. Epic game
@milorider tie game
This Bucks-Bulls game tho....
I could care less who wins this Bucs/Bulls game but, WOW what an epic game.
DAAAAMMMNNN That Jimmy Butler shot tho
Who did this?<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Where's my money? 
@ElijahJoeJune worst "reporter" out of every nfl team.
Breaking news from me: The Raiders will draft a player in the first round this year. BOOM! #payme
Breaking news from Bill Williamson: Raiders looking for an upgrade to Barnes in the draft.... Duh! I wish I got paid to say obvious comments
Being honest here, there is zero chance Raiders choose White over Cooper. White only a possibility if Raiders trade down.
Might as well not even hold a presser if you plan on not answering or dancing around EVERY question. I get it but, sheesh.
@HempsterSkoonie lemmie know where you will be and maybe we can meet up n have a beer. It will b my wifes 1st ever raider game.
Anyone else going to opening day for the Raiders?
@luketheduke0713 @Elias_Trejo shit if raiders get beasley in the second.... Ill try a backflip
If you're a vegan or vegitarian, you can't be trusted.
I refuse to spend $100 on a fight that would have been good 5 years ago. B-Dubs it is on May 2nd
@49ers @OnTheFieldRepor you forgot, 49ers vs their bumbling HC.
Fun fact The Raiders have 5 former first round picks currently on their team.
@DeeBLovgU they always do.. Just leave shit alone twitter. Damn.
@DeeBLovgU haha my bad
@DeeBLovgU shit nvm. The changed it again. Smh
@DeeBLovgU click ur pick hun. Right below it.
I do wanna see a Warriors/Cipps game tho
Fuck the Spurs. Kings suck too.
@MrJayBenz ditto
@davidmichaelsa3 @tombrady120 @nflcommish lol
@davidmichaelsa3 @tombrady120 @nflcommish lol bruh that is not tom bradys account.
I think top 5 pick go like this:
Bucs - Winston
Titans (trade to Chargers or Browns)- Marriota
Jags-Fowler
Raiders - Williams.
So here is my question, what city is further along in getting the Raiders a new stadium? If it is LA that is very telling.
@sic187one  
Welp, looks like the raiders are moving to Carson.
Where are the doomsday crowd at ??? That is a very heavy pro Raider Schedule.

@blackhanside would b fun to watch for sure.
@blackhanside him and mack would b scary. I dont like sio being replaced tho.
For real tho..... The draft needs to hurry up.
We may not agree on who to pick in the draft but, all #RaiderNation Knows we need WRS and pass rushers. A couple of each
@OGSpawnito anytime, enjoy your day.
Im not a dubz fan but, Curry is MVP,  Klay is most improved, and Kerr is COTY. Pretty easy picks.
@OGSpawnito happy birthday#RaiderFam
@lopezee i see why we would but, i think the Raiders want impact players now. RM's job is on the line now. Qb yes let them learn SS a luxury
@lopezee nice. If gregory slides to 19 we gotta pick him up. cant see us taking a SS that early cuzallen &amp; wood. Love collins tho.
@lopezee you?
@lopezee i think white could fall to 12. If not Parker is good. At 19 pick best pass rusher available. Depends how draft plays out honestly.
Really only 4 options that make sense at #4. Williams, cooper, white or trade down. Personally i prefer #12 or 4.
Fuck it, time to day drink.
The closer the draft gets the more i want the #raiders to trade down. Tons of holes still to fill.
@RaidaPlaya  Raiders got a 2nd to move down to #13. So you think 32 yr old trent cole is worth more than a 2nd? #WhatYaSmokin
@RaidaPlaya that is a terrible trade. Just being honest.
@rotoworld and @MikeSilver keeps slandering Crabtree. Means the Raiders are sure 2 sign him now lol #ultimateahater
Happy Easter. #RaiderNation
Grillin some chicken. Yum
Makers mark time <VICTORY HAND>
Im rdy to see some titties.
"@Nbell3: @BWilliamsonESPN yup. 30+ year fan. I'm done with excuses. Win or find someone else that will."this
@USNFeatherman dont hate him either. He was just not good.
@Grizzlyr8dr i think so too. Good wrs through the first 3 rounds. I think he takes a wr in the second.
@MySportsUpdate roids will do that to ya lol
@SilverBlack32 @MattyMatt52 thank you. I hate keap too but, lets b fair here.
@ProFootballTalk Mcfadden is right. No one has seen your best work..... Cept the training staff every week when you're getting treatment lol
@MattyMatt52 @SilverBlack32 a bum qb who has lead a team to 2 champ games. I dont like Keap but carr has yet 2 do shit. Just being real
If raiders sign crabs to a min deal cool. No big loss. Not even sure he makes the team.
"@AnthonyDiMoro: #Redskins acquired Dashon Goldson &amp; 2016 7th-round pick from #Bucs in exchange for a 2016 6th-round pick." good trade
@Grizzlyr8dr rmac has yet to draft a wr. We dont know his wr drafting style yet.
@Grizzlyr8dr look at the stats bro. Jones had more tds. Same amount of yds.
Im honest, i wanted Crabs over DHBust. Does not matter in the long run tho. They both sucked.
@MattyMatt52 bro, i support all Raiders. If they sign him, im forced to support him. Hope he does well but, doesnt mean i like it lol
@MattyMatt52 you r right, he did not have a rookie Qb throwing him the ball. And he still bitched non stop
Good trade by the redskins.
Craptree had 20ish more receiving yrd than J jones, 2 less tds than jones tho. Upgrade? Nah.
"@ROLLINRAIDER: It's a business. ..idgaf about what he said years ago...is what it is...still....don't see him as an upgrade at all" this
Hell as long as jennings has not signed craptree is not even the best FA wr left. All the fa wrs left r not good. Pass.
@Grizzlyr8dr raiders need to just draft 2 wrs. All the fa wrsleft are not good.
@Grizzlyr8dr no, no he is not. Pre-injury i would agree. Since he got hurt he has been garbage.
@Grizzlyr8dr a visit i dont mind. The guy is a diva, bitches 24-7, there is a reason he is unsigned.
Craptree? Really? Lets just hope it is a visit, and dont sign him.

You can unfollow him on Twitter

But you can't unsuc…

Happy thursday 
@AliGuitron was owed 4 mill in salary. Not a starter but good in a rotation type player. Not upset over it just puzzled is all.
@AliGuitron not a fan but, he was far from a problem. Just odd timing is all.
I think some type of trade is coming. Just a feeling. I wonder for who tho.
Raiders have to have something planned with the release of Smith. Odd timing. Standby.
"@ProFootballTalk: Ravens sign Matt Schaub

I think ima eat at my fav Restaurant tonight... The YYYY
@raidergabe @ericlindsey46 @MattCarbonaro i hope yall are right. Not looking like it tho. Unless he KILLS this draft
Offseason started with needs at WR, DE, DT, SS, TE, MLB, OG Hb and CB. 70 mill RM only filled MLB,  and DT.I guess Cwood to SS w/ allen @ fs
@StrongIsland666 @MattCarbonaro i agree he is/was avg.However, it was not a must fill posn with him there. Wr is, MLB, TE, DE, SS, DT, CB is
@MattCarbonaro bottom line is the raiders won 3..Yes 3 games with all these "great players" you say we have. We will have 2 agree 2 disagree
@MattCarbonaro tuck turns 32 this month. Love his leadership but, play has declined.
@MattCarbonaro cwood was great for the first 8 weeks then his age showed up. 
@MattCarbonaro lets not even talk about the Branch, Austin, schaub, flynn, woodley contracts/trades.
@MattCarbonaro murray started 3-4 games smh... He has beenhurt EVERY year. Streeter missed time the past two seasons.
@MattCarbonaro yeah tuck had ppl beating down the door to sign him lol cwood is one of the oldest players in the entire NFL
@MattCarbonaro love the hudson signing tho. But, the only reason C was a need was bcuz he made it a need lol
@MattCarbonaro lofton was one of the worst ILBers the past 3 yrs. Wood is old... Ect ect
@MattCarbonaro carr- hope, murray, injury prone/unproven, street- injury prone, tuck old (5sacks), moore and Sio- awesome. Jano beenhere.
@MattCarbonaro i did. He said... I signed him for 5 yrs and hope to have him that long. Well if no improvement this year hope will b gone
@MattCarbonaro we will have to agree to disagree. 75% of our starters would not start on almost any other team.
@MattCarbonaro on record eh? Where? Show me
@MattCarbonaro and he was hurt last year. Seems the dude is injury prone. Love the guy but he is what he is... Avg
@MattCarbonaro you will. I bet MD wont. 8 wins maybe 7 with signifigant improvement. Dont see it tho
@MattCarbonaro 888 yrds is not 1k.
@MattCarbonaro pro football focus.
@MattCarbonaro this is yr 4! Dude needs 8 wins to show improvement. Have not won more than 4 games since he has been here.
@MattCarbonaro hayden =burnt. Rivera drops everything. Streeter- avg, ect ect. How many of those players start for other teams. Almost none
@MattCarbonaro ummm no lol i love cwood. But he lost many steps last year according to pff.
@MattCarbonaro 11 wins in 3 years. Results speak 4 themselves.
@MattCarbonaro if you have drafted 6 ok/good players in 3 drafts that is not succeding.
@MattCarbonaro wood, pen are old. Jones is avg at best. One good draft... One player (moore) in other draft. Dude has not been good. Sadly
@MattCarbonaro anybody can tear a team apart. He has yet to build anything tho. Hope he does but, looking less than likely
@MattCarbonaro yeah, he got us a ton of cap space..Has not used it well tho, last years FA hual was maybe the worst in history. 1 good draft
RM needs 8 wins (IMHO) to keep his job. He better nail this draft because he is terrible at FA.
@AdamSchefter lol all that speed with rocks for hands, and a two cent work ethic.
@9Ra1der6 @gilbertbautist2 @RAIDERS now that I can dig.
@gilbertbautist2 a vet who offers something, i agree. Welker is not that vet tho
@gilbertbautist2 welker is finished. Has not even had a sniff in FA. Concussions and age did him in.
I am still hoping for a 16 upset over a #1 seed. May never happen but i wanna see it.
"@JohnMiddlekauff: Uhhh what seriously @BairCSN: Per a league source, the Raiders are signing RB Trent Richardson.”"  CHAMPIONSHIP
I could care less who retires from another team. Need to hear some Raider news.
"@RAIDERS: The Raiders have released QB Matt Schaub." bout fucking time.
@luketheduke0713 im am down with a trade down also tons of talent in top 3 rounds.
@luketheduke0713 love beasley. Only prob is where do we play him? Too small to be a DE, have 3 good OLBers already. Unless they move 2 a 3-4
About the only one of the top prospects i dont want is Gregory.
In Order here is who, imho, we should draft. Williams, Cooper, Fowler, White. Im ok with any of these. At least one will b there for sure.
I think is starting to see the Raiders did not "low ball" him. Would be ok if he came back as an OG.
A Christian Ponder.
(Bye Schaub.) #Raiders
@Raiderella gm
@ROLLINRAIDER true. But with the talent they added it may be 102-0 lol
Thank god we do not play the rams next year. That team is gonna b money.
BOOOM GM! Sadly the Raiders still suck.
RM worse than Jordan with a baseball bat.

@R8DER_NATION55 who is the one listening to BSPN? Looks like u my friend.. 300 divided by 4 does not = 930 carries.. If so school f'ed me.
@R8DER_NATION55 last year he had way too many.. Every other year 200 or less. Bout avg for a feature hb.
@R8DER_NATION55 point is.. First he has played 4 years so not 300/yr. And no one says those other players have too many carries.
@R8DER_NATION55 @VicTafur 930 total carries ... AP  over 2k, lynch over 2k,  mccoy 1400 carries.... Stop believing BSPN

@MattCarbonaro not what MD said lol he said he EXPECTS results this year.
Juat ignore me tonight lol I am in a crap mood. Tired of our raiders sucking and being second rate to everyone.
@TruRaider4Life he has signed a center. That is it. Lost a center to sign a center. Not exactly building. Replacing ..... So far
@MattCarbonaro 3 probs w/ that.. RM gonna get fired if no results this year, have to reach salary cap floor, RM has ONE good draft outta 3.
@MattCarbonaro need an impact Guard. Name one available. Need an impact WR name one, if Knighton skips us name an impact DT. And need a MLB
@MattCarbonaro most gone now. Dumpster diving now. Need knighton, but even him and Hudson w/ no others is a fail FA

Wooo hoo dan williams as a back up plan if Raiders do not get knighton.. Feeling excided yet!!  ***Totally sarcastic tweet***
@RapSleet @ericbeaulieu84 fake
"@BrianMejiaNFL: RT @BWilliamsonESPN: Hearing #Riders have checked in as part of a large group on Chiefs safety Ron Parker." zzzzz
@MsAutumnWind @BHTruth 9 mill a year. Pass
@MsAutumnWind to kill his fantasy value... Duh. Lol
@pseudolynch if they are the groom. Raiders are certainly the bride.
@holistic_pickle @AthleticsRaider OG signed with cards
Guys, Raiders are not signing Hardy. He is not the type of player RM is looking for..... Meaning he is not a third tier guy lol
@SilverNBlack78 @ProFootballTalk he may throw him a molly, or some coke but certainly not a football lol
"@ProFootballTalk: According to Rosenhaus, it's a two-year, $6 million deal for Hartline with the Browns." bye bye fantasy value
@raider_level slot guy. Will likely have to sign a short term "prove it deal". Why not.

VIDEO: 
"@dkurtenbach: #49ers FB Bruce Miller cited in Santa Clara police blotter for spousal battery charge. 
I dont want Torrey Smith on the Raiders but... It is not too late to back outta that Niners deal now bro.. Js
Maclin off my fantasy draft too... Check lol
Take J. Thomas and Hartline off my fantasy draft... Check.
@R8DER_NATION55 no worries lol wish it was chris. Jake is washed up from injuries sadly.
@DieHardR8rsFan @RomaRaider because when you are losing by 30 a game... No need to pass after the first half. Come on man
No time for un-intelligent fools. <VICTORY HAND>
@R8DER_NATION55 jake long lol
@RomaRaider bahaha you cant fix stupid i guess. Raiders Pass D was dead last.... Pats not so much
@RomaRaider nope you implyed it and put words in people's mouths. I simply said Moss was the last 1k yard receiver. Moss was a cancer
@RomaRaider &lt;----- this guy think DJ Hayden and Tj Carrie are better CBs than Revis .... See what i did there?
@RomaRaider hi, i never said he was a success. I said he was our last 1k yr receiver. Fact. Learn to debate, and not be a child. <VICTORY HAND>
@RomaRaider you mean the last receiver to have 1k yard season on the Raiders? Got it lol
@RomaRaider bucs played a tampa 2 he is a man to man cb. Big difference.
@RomaRaider revis instantly would improve any team. I would like the Raiders to improve. Call me crazy.
I think there is 0.00000000001% chance Revis woupd sign with the Raiders. I would love to have him but, not gonna happen sadly.
I have a feeling a few more of these "done deals" end up not happening. Save this tweet.
If you have not blocked Ricky Bobby, I still do not know what you are doing with your life.
@Sir_Bay_Raider he tweeted a thanks to the Chiefs.. He restructured (took less to stay in Kc) just showing kc fans some love is all
Frank Gore pulling out...... There is a joke in there somewhere.
@Joltdudeuc nah, injuries ruined him
@AdamScheftor @mashman4077 fake... Ugh
@RomaRaider @RAIDERS amen
@AsahSkye thomas got a deal larger than Gronks. Pass
@WordIsBondSon lol biggie had 2 albums... Tupac died and then released more than 2 albums.
@AdamScheftor @R8TRJIM fake
@winbabywinwin @incarceratedbob is he ever not?
@incarceratedbob @winbabywinwin not bob again... Fuck lol
@RrapSheet @raiderette02 fake account
"@DieHardR8rsFan: can someone link me where a reliable source says we agreed with pot roast." yes plz
@RawSports365 nope front loaded. Love it
@JO310JO wiz is looking for 5-7 per year. Not worth it honestly.

@JO310JO yes. He is a top 3  center. Wiz was a top 20 center. Huge upgrade.
@DondiRaider @ProFootballTalk *stay
@DondiRaider @ProFootballTalk and hopefully willis wants to atay in the bay.
@DondiRaider @ProFootballTalk agreed
@ProFootballTalk patrick willis will be released.
#BeerThirty

@Zilla_Gorbs @JeremyMaclin18 fake account bruh.
@MALOBILL lol
@MALOBILL lol raiders put a restricted tag on him he can sign w/e he wants raiders get the right to match. If they want him.
@MALOBILL where that at? And Raiders can match any offer.
@DeeDub67 yeah, a pancake. From I-Hop tho.
@mcg222 link to twitter site plz?
@DondiRaider where u see that?
@GeoffMosherCSN only they lost cole..williams was basicly the same as maxwell.
@ROLLINRAIDER yeah. No way they can afford maclin and hudson.
"@Athletics: FINAL: White Sox 10, #Athletics 4."winner winner chicken dinner.
@Rone712 yeah. Looks like they are gonna have to.
@SpookyRaider we can only hope. He only has one solid draft tho. Time will tell.
@SpookyRaider i like coop and white. Still needed another to go with em tho.
@SpookyRaider yeah. Looks like maclin going back to eagles. I wanted him. Oh well
@SpookyRaider oh i agree but wr market almost all dried up. Rest is fine
@SpookyRaider not in this case lol most impact fas already signed now
@SpookyRaider u missed zero Raiders news
"@957thegame: #WhiteSox with a solo HR.  #WhiteSox lead the #Athletics 10-3" boom
"@957thegame: #WhiteSox continue to add on more.  #Athletics trail the #WhiteSox 9-3 in the 8th." GO WHITE SOX
Rumors in philly are Maclin and Shanchez both resigning with Eagles.
Now is not the time to fight with eachother #RaiderNation
@DondiRaider @RAIDERS u right lol
@DondiRaider @RAIDERS haha
Clips may lose today but... Hey lakers fans dont break your neck looking up at EVERYONE in the NBA
@DarthRaider9152 cooper gonna catch passes, rush the QB, block on the o line, cover wrs. Damn. Yeah im chill then lol
@Beasor_Sean will b 32 when the season starts.
@RAIDERS hi, your fan base would like some impact signings.... Thanks. 

Signed #RaiderNation
@JFMcMullen @raidermatt916 signifigant money to Gresham? FML
"@ProFootballTalk: Report: Raiders to be suitors for Bengals TE Jermaine Gresham 
"@ChiSportUpdates: A source has told me that Terrance Knighton is leaning towards signing with the #Bears" we miss on him... Panic
@DieHardR8rsFan @Savageman32 it is not lol dude is always wrong.. But i hope he guesses right in this case
@MattCarbonaro @TheRaidersDaily lol ikr
"@TheRaidersDaily: Per Source: Mark Davis is not pleased with how things are going in #FreeAgency visually upset.#Raiders"not sure bout this
@donaldday0129 @9Ra1der6 agreed
@9Ra1der6 yeah man. Veey solid lb core
@9Ra1der6 
@9Ra1der6 yeah he a FA. He is tweeting with Reese currently. Check out my RTs
I am totally down with Mason Foster at MLB
I been sayin all along Maclin should have been the guy to target. I think he stays in philly but i hope RM tries at least.
@Eazy_Estevez yup. Place is a dump. Full of ghetto mo fos. Glad i moved over 10 years ago lol
@Eazy_Estevez agreed. I grew up there. #Shithole
@R8RN8NBlines dude is a chronic under-achiever. Ask Bengals fans. Not a big impact if raiders get him.
If RM replaces wiz with Hudson that is a major win.
@NJRaiderMane lmao. Yeah dude blows.
@R8D3R_J anytime fam
@R8D3R_J jags
If the Raiders miss out on a Knightington. Then worry.
@MALOBILL @RAIDERS nope. Wouod have to give up two first round picks. = not gonna happen
@9Ra1der6 i wanted maclin over cobb and got  slammed 4 it. Lol
@mjwoody805 @Elias_Trejo malaluga already resigned. Clay is tagged .. So have to pay him over 7.5 mill a year to steal him.
@OneSeanS @ClubRaider it is/was better in det
@OneSeanS @ClubRaider agreed. Miami just screwed themselves for the next 2-3 yrs.. 8-8 team 4 life lol
@OneSeanS @ClubRaider miami just cut their whole FA spending spree in 2013. They have made Al Davis type signings. Not smart.
Still lots of good player available. Chill #RaiderNation if come Thursday RM has not done squat then start worrying. TBH RM has sucked at FA
@SpookyRaider nope
Maclin is who i wanted from the start. Tweeted it a week ago. Having said that i dont think he cares for the Raiders. Prob wont get him.
@SpookyRaider yup to the jags
Sorry but Gresham sucks. I would rather have Cameron and his concussions.
@Sir_Bay_Raider i said he is better than Cobb week ago. Meant it too
Phins gonna cut their whole team for Suh... Lol great way to run a team.
@raidermatt916 @NEPD_Loyko vomit
I wanted Suh but 114 mill? Paidmore than JJ Watt, and he is older. Im def not upset we did not pay that.
@OmarKelly whyy is oak not interested in Hughes?
@keymaker77 cobb* typo lol
@keymaker77 i have always liked Maclin more than carr. That said i dont think we get Maclin.
@Tgoins49 report already came out saying the visit to oak was just a leverage play. He will not visit. Sadly
@Tgoins49 he is not visiting.
Its cool. I been telling yall for weeks cobb is a slot wr. I liked maclin more as a number 2 and draft our number one.
@DondiRaider nope we were gonna draft a number one anyway
Maclin time
Cobb re-signs with the packers... Still do not want Suh now?
I dont care if this fight is free. I want my money back #Boring
Broner wayy faster than Molina.
Molina does not look very good yet.
@BHTruth @LoFernandez9428 yup. I reported that account.. Sick of fakes
@RaiderRay_81 @ProFootbaIITaIk fake account my bad
@BHTruth lol
@Sir_Bay_Raider both. Women tell worse lies tho. Like its your baby lol
@Sir_Bay_Raider vic cotto
Heck yeah. 
Will i be devasted if it doesnt happen?
Nope
@Sir_Bay_Raider @ADJSports @NFLVR np. If you ever want to know any teams up 2 date cap space go to : 
@Sir_Bay_Raider @ADJSports @NFLVR 26 mill
@Sir_Bay_Raider yeah bro, been active duty for 14 yrs. 6 more to go lol
@Sir_Bay_Raider yup, love cali but, i will not b retiring here in 6 yrs when i retire.
@Central_NFL not gonna happen. SD still has the same taxes as Oak. Oak way more cap space.
@VicTafur @ProFootballTalk the first rule of tampering is.... You dont talk about tampering. -Fight Club
Happy legal tampering!
Media over-reacting to Holmes tenure. Raiders  still get the right to match any offer. If he gets a crazy offer then pass.
@RapSheet if the Raiders cant get Suh because of Cali income taxes no way the Chargers could.
#PayTheMan 
@BiggB81 oh ok lol no worries bro
@BiggB81 agreed
@BiggB81 yes, believe my tweet implied that lol
"@BHTruth: Reggie trying to trade Schaub but I don't see a team stupid enough to do that. #raiders" this
@USNFeatherman @Sir_Bay_Raider agreed either him or the guy from Miami
@RVA_playboy @Sir_Bay_Raider no offense but that is a terrible idea.
@Sir_Bay_Raider yea man. Cant wait for FA to start.
I really wish this Pac /Mayweather fight happened 5 years ago. When both were in their prime.
SHAQ is 8 ft tall with prob like a 4 ft dick. How tf did he not split his ex in half lol
@DarksideRaiders nah too old sadly.
I loved Zach Miller as a Raider. Too bad he got so many concussions.
@whiteygleason oh well, he is worth it. Imo
I am still interested to c what happens with Revis. No way NE keeps him at 20 mill this year.
The fact Schaub is not cut tellsme they are trying to fix his cap # or trade him.
Roughly 67 mill under the cap now. Time to go shopping!!!
@GReyesLB me too brother
@GReyesLB tuck, jones were solid too. Rest were terrible.
@abettertattoo lol u got that right.
Damn, now when Raiders Cut Schaub they will have have over 71 mill to spend... Wow.
@ericbeaulieu84 just waiting on schaub....
(via @AdamSchefter) 
@GReyesLB wiz wants to be paid as a top 10 center. Which he is not. He got pushed around far too much at center.
@ROLLINRAIDER ditto lol
Hey Reggie, it is Friday. Time to cut Schaub.
Jets getting marshall means bye bye harvin.
@BHTruth amen
@NikJamTheMan morale of the story. Cal sucks.
@VicTafur @RVinnyT thank you!!! I have been tying to tell Raider fans that all day lol
@ajmg__ nah. Just want them to offer up the cash. If he picks elsewhere then at least we tried.

@ROLLINRAIDER @cody_washburn hell i know the Raiders prob not even gonna get him but, hopefully the Raiders see what this would mean 2 fans
@Namcrow @NickC941 i think he fits in with the other getting arrested happy Niners.
Sign Suh to a front loaded deal. We can outbid anyone once Schaub is cut. #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland  #SuhToOakland

@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 i know bro. But, i think you should. Raiders legit have to spend their cap.
@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 u right... No old guys. Pay these STARS in their prime. Suh, cobb ect.
@LakersRaiders23 @DeeDub67 ohhhhh h booother... Guess the Raiders wont sign anybody haha. Nothing but love
Dont like my tweets move the fuck on.  <VICTORY HAND> #IcouldCareLess
@WeScYdERaZ3D byrd, and a bunch of over paid vets lol
@Raider_Rackz <VICTORY HAND>
@WeScYdERaZ3D i think colston would free up like 8 mill, their MLB another 7 but still lol

@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 if not Suh then it will be an ass load of others. Raiders HAVE to spend money... Or they lose it
@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 then be prepaird to b suprised. Raiders have to spend this year and next or face penelties.
@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 mark has already been spending. Upgraded facilities, quality coaches. And has 200 mill to try and get stadium.
@DeeDub67 @LakersRaiders23 suh has publicly said he will go to who pays him the most. Hope we do.
@JasonLaCanfora miami does not even have 17 mill in cap space lol
As of right this second in 2016 raiders would have 108 mill in cap space lol. 2017 136 mill haha
Saints stil 16 mill over the cap. Yikes. Cuts coming. Pats 4.7 over and Chiefs 3.5 over too.
@BayAreaPlaya510 @BHTruth what curse? Cuz a diva wr did not come here last yr it is a curse now? Lol

@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals @RAIDERS your not bursting my bubble. Whoever gets Suh just got a franchise player. Hope its us.
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals @RAIDERS agree to disagree bro.
@raiderrick76 @MrOakTown55 @CelReece45 @26DrDeath @gorillarilla @rodstreater80 @TwentyFourWines #SuhToOakland
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals @RAIDERS hayneswoth always had questionable work ethic.. Never questioned bout Suh.
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals @RAIDERS why? FAs like him come along once in a generation. I give him a blank check.
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals he may. We gotta put the full press on him tho.
RM and MD need to open up that check book and pay some people this FA. Why not #SuhToOakland
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals will need to happen soon. Suh will sign shortly after FA opens. I see Jax as bigger comp that those 2
@DeeDub67 @MiamiDolphins @AZCardinals cards have 13 mill in cap space. Phins 9.5... Not enough coin.
@VicTafur @Android112608 his agent have a twitter? Lol #SuhToOakland
Fine one more time RT away.
#SuhToOakland  #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland
Looks like #SuhToOakland is not gonna catch on lol oh well, guess i will go b productive.
"@MattyMatt52: @LAsante25 @NdamukongSuh HELL YEA 
@Oahu_Raider808 i do like Beasley ALOT tho. Wish he would b a need /fit but he is not right now.
@Oahu_Raider808 size*
@Oahu_Raider808 if he had the side to play DE RM would b all over him. He is a pure OLB tho. And what if BPA was a QB, bet ya RM passes.
@Oahu_Raider808 that is the problem. We dont know if he is better... We know what Sio and Mack are. Far more pressing needs than OLB atm
@Oahu_Raider808 normally i would agree. But, he would take Sio or Macks job. He is an OLB so not gonna happen
@MattyMatt52 triple Suh, cobb. Double Cobb and Thomas lol
If yall wanna jump on the #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland ....that would be great. 
@LoFernandez9428 love White too
@SmushCrook @Prince_Julius21 who cares. Shows our passion lol

@AssPooRia @LAsante25 there is a dirty joke in there but, ima leave it alone haha
@AssPooRia lol
@AssPooRia that may happen. But, they cant get rid of both back up QBs at once lol
I really think the Raiders have not cut Schaub because they hope someone trades for him #NotGonnaHappen lol
@Papamidnight17S he wont b for long. 5 mill is too much for a back up. He is expected to b released soon.
@Prince_Julius21 heard they want a 5th or 6th. Bcuz his salary would b 7 mill
@LakersRaiders23 unless it happened in the last 20 mins nah.
@Papamidnight17S they already said they will not b.
@Papamidnight17S rodgers and Ausberry too.
@Papamidnight17S mcfadden is a FA.
@GReyesLB i dunno. There are still a few to be released.
What would the Nation think of a WR core of Marshall, Cobb, j. Jones and streeter. Would that b enough for ya?
Dare I say it ... Maybe the best FA class ever?
Lots of good players avaiable. Harvin getting released soon, marshall on the block, andre Johnson. Revis may b 2 if he does not restructure.
@nickhjeltness plus niners couldnot afford his 20 mill salary this yr.
@nickhjeltness nah he is just going to an expo he was scheduled to b at. Nothing 2 c here
I wonder if Suh did not get tagged last yr would RM have went after him.
We can only hope Oakland is Suh's first and last stop in FA. #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland #SuhToOakland

"@Eric_Branch: #49ers announce they've signed WR Jerome Simpson to two-year deal. Simpson has been arrested three times since 2012." typical
@JOELABENZ @ericbeaulieu84 65 mill. Will be 70 when schaub is cut.
If someone told me u can have Suh for Woodley, Schaub, MJD and Booth, you know damn well you would do it. #SuhToOakland
@R8D3R_J he should have retired last year. But does not change how good he used to b haha
Schaub is the only one left to cut. Maybe a few  more but he not worth 5 mill
"@AdamSchefter: Raiders announced they officially released LB LaMarr Woodley."FINALLY
@R8D3R_J lol when he was in Jax. I used to love watching him run. #Respect
