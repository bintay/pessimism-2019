Smelly cat, smellllly cat. What are they feeding you?
Beauty. 
You'll wish you kept your fucking mouth shut and read a book instead of worrying about their sins whilst yours is simultaneously piling up.
You know what's so ironic? On the day of judgement you won't give a shit about anyone else's sins except your own.
Humble yourself.
"Your beginning is a piece of sperm and your end is a dead carcass and in between you're a vessel that carries around urine and faeces."
Stop pushing people away from the deen and remind them how Mericful Allah is.
"None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself." That's what being a Muslim is about.
And if that person believes in the five pillars of Islam, whether he is gay or not, you have NO say.
When someone says ‘there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah’ you have no say in whether they're Muslim or not.
@yaniaden it's also the fact that you can't control your thoughts. That's why the idea of being gay in your head is not haram
@yaniaden sex with the same gender is not haram, الله is testing you, acting upon it is. You see? There isn't much difference.
@yaniaden is tested by الله. So acting upon it is it becomes a sin, similarly with gay people, it's the same gender, so thinking about havin
@yaniaden There are Muslims who want to commit zina and thinking of sex is not haram because it's innate and whether you act upon it
You just don't wanna learn. @yaniaden
@yaniaden who are you to decide who is muslim and who is not? There is no shirk involved.
@yaniaden your Imaan. Thinking it is not haram as you have no choice, it becomes a sin once you act upon it.
@yaniaden have you not considered that gay thoughts, may be a test from God to see if you will act upon it? Thus making it a sin and testing
@yaniaden @highkeychildish do you know what you're talking about tho, do you know what being gay is
@janakadahhh however it's not for us to decide.
@yaniaden @highkeychildish but he's right lol
@janakadahhh well, it could possibly lead to it. As apart of being Muslim is believing all the Islamic teachings/rules

If you could have a role in any TV show, what would it be? — F.r.i.e.n.d.s 
Just because by law we are supposed to practice our humans rights, does not mean the government will give us the freedom to do so. Protest.
It's like how we have human rights but in some countries they take some of your rights away from you. This is why we protest.
But do Muslims allow women to practice these rights?
And then there are these Muslims that don't believe in feminism because Islam already gives women rights.
These online sheikhs are seriously sexist. And deep down they truly believe that they are above women.

How can you allow your soul to be devoid of spirituality. Connect to something bigger than yourself, don't starve your soul.

I think footballers are overpaid.
Politicians are probably psychopaths.
I think the MRI Scan is one of the best inventions everrrr.
Even though MRI Scans are so expensive, the Government should stop wasting money on trivial things and being in debt over wars.
I personally think there should be MRI scan check ups for people at least every 2-3 years or so. Psychopaths have brain abnormalities.
Or watch documentaries about serial killers.
I'm so bored. I guess I'm going to binge on movies today.

Weirdest YouTube comment:
"I got my brother a stripper for his B-day.
My mother wasn't impressed, but it's not every day he turns 8."
When it's too good to be true, it usually is.
Some people are too trusting of others and just because someone seems good, doesn't always mean they are.
People are easy to read over time.
I actually feel like I'm a good judge of character. Is there such thing as over analysing people, I don't think so!

To fall in love with God is the greatest of all romances; to seek Him, the great adventure; to find Him, the greatest human achievement.

On the other hand, for internal respect you kind of do, in the way you present yourself etc. but it goes both ways for men and women.
For external respect, you don't have to give anyone anything to receive respect. Being human should be enough.
People need to finish statement like these with "and vice versa" because it goes both ways.
"It's a man's job to respect a woman but it's a woman's job to give him something to respect." This statement is one sided and incomplete..

@HypnagogicStrix id actually disagree, it's so much more easier to turn the smallest things sexual nowadays.
@HypnagogicStrix yes exactly. Not twitter shuyookhs.
@HypnagogicStrix the idea of zina and fitnah won't seem that bad making it more likely to commit those sins. I hope you understand.
@HypnagogicStrix he problem is that if sex is most frequently talked about, then the things you say about it won't matter and
@HypnagogicStrix when it comes to the matter of haya, it's about limitin what you say when it comes to these kind of talks...
@HypnagogicStrix the problem is that their intention might not be to just teach these things but to engage in sexual conversations w/ others

Ain't nobody got time to live in a country where they are constantly attacking your beliefs.
@kenafeh honey, one ass cheek is triple the size of your head...

If they're starting to ban religions, I.e the RIGHTS to practice any religion and follow any belief you want. It's time to make hijrah.
Sorry but that's just ugly.
What even is that, can she balance herself or does she fall on her ass all the time?

I've struggled w/ imaan my whole teenage life&amp;it's been hard getting back up each time but I wont stop bcos I can't find peace anywhere else
Your imaan wasn't even high enough to begin with and praying is the only way because being consistent with Qur'an and dikr is another level.
It's been happening for years and it's really hard to maintain your imaan without praying, you can make dikr and read qur'an but what if...
@HypnagogicStrix Thank you.
Does any other Muslimah relate to this, or is it just me? :(
my willingness to practice becomes stronger but I cannot pray and I'll ruin my imaan during that week and it's a vicious cycle.
Why does this always happen to me, EVERY SINGLE TIME before the time of the month, I feel my imaan going higher and...
@HypnagogicStrix Well, going to Jannah should be one of/main objective but that's not all, and if its your only target..something is missing
@HypnagogicStrix Do tell
With Islam, you never stop learning &amp; you are never perfect. There is always something to gain knowledge about &amp; there's always more to do.
It's very misunderstood. Even by people who practice it. That's why you no longer look at Muslims to understand Islam.
Islam is both easy and difficult to practice and understand. It just depends on your intention, your level of faith and your willingness.

As shown on the documentary, it is a wiring problem in the brain that causes this.
There are pedophiles with morals, who realize their issue but will not act upon their desires and those might just recover.
But you know what, threats and abuse to this guy will not help him, or other men to seek help because they fear that kind of response.

@kenafeh Basically what I mean, is training yourself and your mind. Why thank you, Miss.
@HypnagogicStrix Agreed.
@kenafeh  cos the devil doesn't phase you anymore. You know all his tricks.
@kenafeh But I'd like to think you can train them to a certain extent. There might be a point where you're not easily manipulated/influenced
@HypnagogicStrix But it's also about weakness, how to get the strength to not let the devil preoccupy your mind&amp; to make the angel stronger.
@kenafeh or whatever the angel is supposed to do. Perhaps he let the devil win by letting him into his mind and dominating his thought.
@kenafeh It kind of shows how the angel isn't doing his/her job by shooing the devil away and replacing those negative words with positivity

My attendance is really shit. And they won't let me put down 'acute insomnia' as my reason for absence.
So not being able to sleep properly, I just can't convince myself to get up for college. Hence getting complaints from my teachers.
I don't exercise before bed to feel tired, I just think a lot and I tire myself out this way.
Now I'm awake and it's 3am. It's as if my mind can't sleep through the night. As if I must be awake to witness it. I'm truly an owl.
Yesterday I slept at 7pm and I think I almost fell into this eternal sleep stage where you never wake up. But I eventually did, sadly.
My main problem is managing my sleep and time.

"Contra killers are called freedom fighters. Well, If crime fighters fight crime &amp; firefighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight?"
"Israeli murderers are called commandos, Arab commandos are called terrorists."
Those were all George Carlin's words but paraphrased. What a smart man.
"Some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time if it were still called shell shock."
Then the war in Vietnam, the same condition was called "post-traumatic stress disorder" still eight syllables but with a hyphen!
The war in korea, 1950, the same combat condition was called "operational exhaustion", 8 syllables.
Second world war, the same combat condition was called "battle fatigue" four syllables now. Doesn't seem to hurt as much.
For e.g. condition in combat, when a person is at war, nervous system snaps. WW1 it was called "SHELL SHOCK" sounds like the guns themselves
"Smug, greedy well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins. It's as simple as that." - George Carlin

I really love what George Carlin said about euphemisms (soft language).
@phantasmiclife Yes, yes you are being silly
Just like a girl might turn down a boy because he doesn't meet her height requirement, its preference.
And if a guy turns down an overweight female because he likes thinner girls, he shouldn't be looked down upon because that's his preference.
I agree with the height thing too (previous retweet), there is double standard there. Myself included but then again that's preference.
@phantasmiclife I see.
And to be realistic, men do have more rights than women, they may suffer from double standards but women have more to fight for.
Feminism is fighting for equality for both sexes. It's not what its made out to be now by sexist teenage girls.
'Meninism' does show some double standards but it's not taken seriously and its just fighting for the equality of men and not anyone else...
How do I rant whilst being extremely vague?

Not only do I feel grey, I am the colour grey.
Life can be beautiful but it feels cold here and after many years of existing, the world doesn't feel like home.
Life is all about poetry, books, politics, art and religion (for me).
It's weird because I was reading this book and I felt like I was in it, I felt what the narrator felt and it was intense.
Open the first page, and live in it.
And these characters in the book, it's like you create this strong bond and attachment, it's quite overwhelming and beautiful.
Getting bored of reality, so I switched off the tele and picked up a book. All these characters, it's like I've met them all.
Depressive realism, that's all.

@kenafeh where are you when I need you.
@phantasmiclife there wasn't enough space to move away from him, so I got off the next stop
@phantasmiclife <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I was coming back from the vet, on my way home with my kitten in a cage, and this guy was like "is it a kit-kat?" Looooool
@FinalForesight I know. I got off next stop. I don't know if he was trying to nick me or touch me...
This guy thought he was real slick putting his hands under my jacket whilst seated on the bus wtf.
When it's really cold like it is now I try to imagine that I'm in a dessert under a scorching sun with no water and that still doesn't work.
@phantasmiclife why do you do this <WEARY FACE>
because humans are not nice and this is why we are not honest with our opinions.
If you ask me for my honest opinion on something and you reply with "thats not nice" after I tell you. You shouldn't have asked me.
A saint is a sinner who got up.
@psychxpathis thank you <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>

Meet my new kitten Pacino, he loves shoes. 
Seize the day.

“@Rumi_Quote: Prayer clears the mist and brings back peace to the Soul.”
@FinalForesight what did I say that would offend someone?
“@RasAlGhul321: “O you who believe, do not consume each other’s wealth wrongfully.” (4:29)”
You know what's also messed up, people are making jokes about that picture as they quote tweet it, like they're desensitised <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@FinalForesight if I did, I didn't meant to offend. My apologies
I wish I did not see that. My heart hurts wtf is wrong with people
“@Rumi_Quote: Find the sweetness in your own heart. that you may find the sweetness in every Heart.”
If someone uses religion to perpetuate hate, you can say something but if I'm preaching religion with peace, why won't you reply with peace?
@FinalForesight trust you to comment with negativity. It saved mine. Let's leave it there.
Religion is a beautiful thing. It saves lives.
He who has no friend has God. 
Queen, yes? 
You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life?

When you see love with all your heart you shall find its echoes in the universe. - Rumi.

Predictable in my own unpredictability.
Faithful yet detached.
Do you ever feel like you love everyone and yet no one.
We all need to eventually find solace in solitude without the disturbance of unwanted thoughts.
@phantasmiclife it doesn't make it any funnier but okay.
@phantasmiclife that was so not funny
@SovereignEye I feel the same way about the sky.
Perhaps if a shrink paid me to cry in every session without a word, perhaps I'll recover (whilst he secretly prescribes me the good stuff)
Perhaps sitting in a shrinks office and talking about how much of a burden life is, doesn't really work.
@SovereignEye that's lovely, where is it from or is it just a quote?
@Sumeriangod disturbing imagery

I find it so funny when Lord Sugar points his sausage fingers at people when he fires them loooool
Is Lord Sugar a self-absorbed prick or just professional?
That's just the way the world is.
A lot of us don't even deserve the blessings we have. It's wasted on us.
I want something that will mask what I don't want to display.
Sigh<PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>
My brains all like "it's a no from me" 
You know when you're about to catch feelings but your brain is giving you a lil pep talk, talking you out of it.
I had my first waitressing job and I'm glad to say I didn't break anything <GRINNING FACE>
@psychxpathis only if I get to see yours
Should I make Instagram?
It's better to keep your mouth shut and give the impression that you're stupid than to open it and remove all doubt.
I was on the train and this moon kept looking at me like wtf

She's been in England for like 14 years and she doesn't know English looool
Like I'm teaching my grandma how to use a phone and the internet looks like the earth and I had to tell her it's the mondo/terra one lol
There are things I can't say in Arabic because I'm ghetto and google translator is too formal and fus7a so I have to translate Italian words
My grandma said she was horrified at how ugly I looked when I was born <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>then she said "Ba3den ga3ti gamar" lol she has her way with words

I think I'm good at guessing peoples height and age from pictures and in real life. Idk if I'm good but I do it all the time.

@Sumeriangod who's blood?
My forehead is quite spacious lol euphemism for receding hair line
@kenafeh omg don't say that
Pictures are so deceiving lol
Your brain tastes like ignorance 
I've seen too much of reality to still believe in fairy tales.

I still watch scary movies. I think I like the thrill of being scared.
The revolution will be televised, so funny haha
I'm not a good person to watch scary movies with. I will literally jump and scream. So basically, I'm a big baby.
I need to tinkle.

Woman and the earth have to tolerate a lot.
It's evil to not let people question. Its in our nature.
Let life sink in.
They no longer remain in the "best people" category.
But then there is this constant worry of keeping these people as strangers, because anything beyond that is a disaster, most of the time.
I want to make friends on the internet. I wonder why parents tell you not to talk to strangers. They're the best people.
Eternal, forever...that's just too long.
I'm doubt, personified.
Sleep can wait or am I waiting to sleep. Waiting for what?
Give someone a mask and listen to them talk as if no ones listening.
Endlessness.
How can you say you love the day, when you hide from the sun.
The night is so inviting, the moons light is enough to keep me awake.
I should just make tumblr and an anonymous twitter account.

There is ALWAYS something to be thankful for. Even when you're at your worst in life.

Racism never dies. Well, unless the racists die...Hmm. You know what this means.
Political Freudian slips are so funny and its not a slip, it's basically the forbidden truth.
Not sure if pessimistic or realistic...
The amount of euphemisms for the male genitals in the music industry is quite absurd.
