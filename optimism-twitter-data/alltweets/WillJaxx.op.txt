@aaronblackmon We Hott look out for one another, so everybody can be happy. Ok, be blessed, bro. Enjoyed the convo! <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@aaronblackmon I respectfully disagree. It's all our business because I am my brother and sister's keeper!
@aaronblackmon You're right. It's their perogative. But if they never accept another's advance (from any gender), r we 2 call that balance?
@aaronblackmon as a compliment &amp; kept it moving. I'm 100% masculine &amp; comfortable in that. Period. That's being positive &amp; being in balance!
@aaronblackmon Did I "check" him or bust him in the mouth for trying a brotha? Nope. Human beings see beauty everywhere, so I took his words
@aaronblackmon No, Im not. Let me use myself as an example, then. I live in the ATL &amp; yesterday this dude tries to hit on me. Am I gay? Nope
@aaronblackmon some dudes go to the left, doesn't mean its ok for the ladies to become callous &amp; jump all the way to the right. You feel me?
@aaronblackmon I know. However, I wanted to interject because, as you've stayed earlier, in all things there must be a balance. Just because
@aaronblackmon Just tryin' to keep it real.
@aaronblackmon And for a lady, it may be male, but it could also be female. Every woman isn't heterosexual, you know. <WINKING FACE>
@aaronblackmon Because, truth is, if you radiate that positivity, it will attract the positive soul you'll actually desire to get with.
@aaronblackmon Not quite, Sir. My point in context was 2 say the ladies should keep a positive mindset when encountering folks in general.
@aaronblackmon Smiling is exhibited for amusement or fun or to show certain levels of joy.
@aaronblackmon Seeing the positive in things and smiling are two totally different things. Positivity breeds hope, not a smile per se.
@aaronblackmon And unless you provide explanation 2 me, I have only 2 assume. That's why I question: 2 dispel the myth 2 work w/ what is.
@aaronblackmon Sounds 2 me like your type of "balance" is just plain apathy. And if you're apethetic, you might as well be negative.
@aaronblackmon ... the good in a situation, to be optimistic and hopeful, so we can began to counteract some the destruction around us.
@aaronblackmon Anyone who smiles all the time is either in a cult, insane, or a fraud. What I'm saying is that we should work to always==&gt;
@Naysha080 I see. Well, there's always graduate school, Baby Girl. If you're longing for that experience, you gotta get it in! <WINKING FACE>
@aaronblackmon Whether you use tv broadcasts, online blogs, or these streets, you gotta find the pulse &amp; vibration of things around you.
@Naysha080 So why don't you go ahead and go? Ain't nothing to it, but to do it,Baby Girl! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@aaronblackmon @FeministaJones @El_Phillippe ...own opinions, but you can't have your own facts. ijs
@aaronblackmon @FeministaJones @El_Phillippe inherently negative. Turning on the news tells us that. So, as I stated, you're entitled 2 your
@aaronblackmon @FeministaJones @El_Phillippe ...objective, one shld ultimately crave positivity bcause the planet revolves around things==&gt;
@aaronblackmon @FeministaJones @El_Phillippe One of my replies obviously got dropped somehow. What I said was that though balance is the==&gt;
@aaronblackmon @FeministaJones @El_Phillippe You can have your own opinion, but you can't have your own facts
You shouldn't. You should crave positivity, for it brings balance, my friend. Our world revolves around an inherent negativity. Have you ...
@El_Phillippe @FeministaJones Perhaps. Perhaps not. Negative thinking always attracts negativity. Be positive &amp; destiny will come knocking.
@FeministaJones If you're an attractive, desirable woman with a beautiful aura, your smile should turn my head as a man... shouldn't it?

@ajc Here's to a speedy recovery, Tom! You can do it!!!
@Atlanta_Falcons The Cardinals, Lions, Bengals and Green Bay--this schedule is a great tune-up for the Playoffs. #atlfalconsforlife
@Atlanta_Falcons A tough schedule is a great. If we are as good as we KNOW we are, then the schedule won't be an issue! #atlfalconsforlife
Chillin' at the spot with my comfy house shoes on! #atlfalconsforlife 
@RubenStuddard 
@HOTT_SOSS What's up, Soss?
I'm mentally fatigued &amp; just a tad weary right now. I feel like Atlas--strong, but with the weight of the world on my shoulders.

@trumpetgrrrl What's up, Trumpetess!!!
2014 is the "Year of Action". Buy a CD today &amp; help us support ladies suffering with Lupus! 
Heading home to lay down for a spell.... <SLEEPY FACE>
Mmmm--steamed veggies with shrimp. My diet regiment never tasted better! <WINKING FACE> 
I can't believe it: the Broncos are being beat like they stole something! #atlantafalconsalldaybaby 
@artistapachee Get well soon, Baby Girl! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Feeling better by the minute..  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My hero! #ilovejazz 
I'm feeling better than yesterday, but still very weak. Hopefully, this crud will pass sooner rather than later. #orangejuicedownthehatch
I'm suffering from a TERRIBLE cold. I am absolutely miserable! Having a runny nose, watery eyes, chills &amp; constant sneezing is the pits. ☹
My new health regiment is in full swing. "Big Sexy" is getting even sexier! <WINKING FACE>

Only in the ATL can you get 70 degree weather and then 2 days later... this! <EIGHT SPOKED ASTERISK><EIGHT SPOKED ASTERISK><EIGHT SPOKED ASTERISK>

Not attending the GRAMMYS today: just focusing on my 2014 run with my Dichotomy album. Hats off to all the artists nominated &amp; the winners!
Macklemore's about to gentrify Hip Hop at the Grammy's like a hipster in Bed-Stuy...Yeeyayah!
Just took my last shake for the day. This new diet regimen is wearing me out!
