@stephenkb  it should make for a happy joyful optimistic journey
@KevinPMeagher @Conorpope does she watch too much BBC news
Left must tell how they will create wealth. Only then how they will distribute it. They lost because nobody has a clue how they will do it
@SkyNews more likely people read their GREEN manifesto
Just voted for the blessed "David" and feel good about it. Come on Karen Lumley we want you back
@johndavidblake no franchise without taxation - still the best mantra
@LordAshcroft @LucyMPowell @Dannythefink @bbcnickrobinson can I come as well
@stephenkb there must be at least 1 or 2 other things you could be doing that might pass as interesting!
@JohnRentoul @SiobhanFenton It merely requires 2 eggs in 1 basket to be self fulfilling
@IainDale Press responsible as half laughs and half taj
Keys seriously instead of in your face challenge
@stephenkb The press/media responsibility is to make it interesting and hold politicians fairly to account. They are to focussed on trivia
@christopherhope if ed is elected I will go to the place he was going to use instead
@MrHarryCole You can only have equality of input you cannot have equality of output. Equality relies on people working hard and successfully
@stephenkb camoflage
@stephenkb are you a leftie by any chance.
@JohnRentoul @IndyVoices But how stupid the people who are going to vote for it! Freebies do grow on trees and no work required
@BBCPolitics @BBCNews this is a point of high principle and should be enacted and and please please please keep it simple
@DanHannanMEP nearly as bad as asking them where it goes and did that get value for it
@UberFacts but without the assistance there would be fewer McDonalds and therefore an even bigger benefits bill
@UberFacts But where did they look? The fairies might have hidden the evidence, don't you know
@UberFacts When Bliss is full will Blissful become the next most popular
@UberFacts A life of constant surprise is very wearying!
@richardosman @JohnRentoul a bit like Roald Dahls father couldn't spell Ronald
@BBCNews @hendopolis This blatant nonsense and anybody who has spent time in a hospital with a patient knows it
@SkyNews Fjiddling at the edges! Putting more money into a flawed organisation will not help. NHS is a 100 year old model not fit for today
@robertsjonathan @christopherhope Lab seduced people out of self help and made them dependant on the state. A forced marriage to the state.
@georgeeaton He's still a drag with the people I have met today
@stephenkb are you thinking that these tweets are making the majority think that he is now acceptable and less weird
@carlquintanilla @hcpeterson What part of the chicken is its nuggets?
@sima_kotecha It must 3.3 before you really get going!
@truemagic68 Sorry, but tablets don't help either!
@IainDale No
@Conorpope @KTHopkins mmmmmmmmmm .... now why did I start this tweet ....... Oh bang Kate Hopkins ...... Mmmmmm
@His_Grace @Number10gov It is right this is brought to our attention but the question is redundant as we all know why
@JeremyCliffe Not more free school meals nonsense. After that fiasco he should not be allowed any where near schools
@GTMelhuish @MrHarryCole except the weather
@DPJHodges @PaulGoodmanCH Thought we had just had referendum. Didn't know it was going to be one per annum. If they are that keen let 'em go
@Sean_Kemp @montie outside Westminster is anybody interested in this? Not me for one!
High Society- Grace = Am-Dram the rest = professionals
@DPJHodges maybe for the media. I have been out and about all day and did not here one mention of her. The sane have other things in mind
@DPJHodges Well in that case head doctor welcome here. Slogan on slogan on repeated slogan. Yawwwwwnnnn
@IsabelHardman Are the figures accurate?
@BBCNews @BrianWheeler01 too much media coverage which will be 5% news and 95% comment. Pass me a blindfold and ear plugs.
@Tell_Karen you have represented us well and I want you to continue to do so
@IsabelHardman Please please please please not 5 weeks of shallow, mock outrage, overly specific media coverage of medias election take
@SkyNews All about Simon's re-election and not Kate
@SkyNews
@BBCNews Rather a strange tag line to this tweet. Some headline qualification would have made it balanced
@truemagic68 Miliband put the the advert in the F T knowing that all other media outlets will report it so the public will hear via BBC/Sky
@truemagic68 he is not trying to convince business he is hoodwinking the public into thinking he cares about business
@afneil part of the price media pays for concentrating on the irrelevant specifics.
@SkyNews seems to me that they have missed a few
@iankatz1000 @anntreneman @matthancockmp @George_Osborne  is this the legendary Katz unbiased balance being evidenced again
@amolrajan @JeremyCliffe you wouldn't be saying that if you were going to vote for the winner. That is the way democracy works
@ThePoke 5
@BBCr4today Will they also have duty to ensure energy companies are viable and have the ability to be national champions! Labour is bonkers
@JohnRentoul we shouldn't be too upset it's only a [short] galley kitchen
@MichelleDewbs @TheLondonTri have plenty potatoes and sofas !
@business Does this show a difference in pay of a man and a women in identical roles with identical work outcomes and T and C's
@paulwaugh Broadcasters are getting too powerful and politicians will redress the balance. The over mighty should exercise proper care
@paulwaugh @bbcnickrobinson hope all goes well and that you are back very soon
@DanHannanMEP Political only politicians is a horror of horrors
@cpeedell @NHAparty Tax Avoidance equals tax minimisation which is legal and incentivised by 12000 pages of government tax codes
@cpeedell @NHAparty No it doesn't other than it being cheaper and more customer focussef
@NHAparty what absolute utter unadulterated rubbish. The Nhs is a 19th century organisation facing 22nd century customers
@SkyNews This is a once a year news filler I have been reading for 60 years
@BackNoMoreGames Well I wouldn't put this debate in the hands of the doctors'Trade Union. The NHS is set up for a time gone bye
@BuzzFeedUKPol @JohnRentoul Can't imagine politicians with nothing but politics on their minds. How much more miserable our lives would be!!
@SoccerInsider @washingtonpost tea still wins
@DanHannanMEP when too much money is borrowed we all do as we are told - beware Mr Osbourne
@montie @TheGoodRight @thetimes Great manifesto, pity it's behind the pay wall. Not meant in a negative way but I want to support this
@montie @giles_fraser I just wish he would talk over everybody like he does! I guess it is only "apparent" agreement
@CapX @DanHannanMEP 17000 page tax code and then we punish people who have read it. As ever, politicos put your house in order
@MichaelLCrick A tax code of 12000 pages is the responsibility of politicians and incentivises the employment of advisors. Blame politicos
Politicians should take blame. A taxcode 12000 pages long incentivises use of advisors to ensure you do not pay more than required
@BBCr4today is just a Christian God he doesn't like or all gods. Whatever the answer can he explain calmly and reasonably the reasons
@MichaelLCrick confusion reigns when a religion doesn't believe in anything but niceness
@hattmarris84 @steve_hawkes  he would need more than 46 letters  to be polite so how rude was he?
@hattmarris84 @IainDale @edballsmp Wow that would be boring. If they do then no numbers. That should liven it up. Let them talk philosophy
@MaxCRoser and still inequality of outcome would exist in equally large dollops
@DanHannanMEP f
@GuidoFawkes @CarolineFourest We all know the reason is fear for employees and assets. Why don't they just say that instead of being fatuous
@GuidoFawkes the inclusion of Boris weakens the impact of the real horrors of the others. Silly
@toryboypierce @LBC YES
@JohnRentoul @joyfeed @markjupp4 As everybody at the Beeb leans to the left they can't see people leaning to the left. But to the right ...!
@JohnRentoul Wow, I'm beginning to think you are a "sad'o"
@JohnRentoul Nothing less than we expect old boy!
@JananGanesh @DPJHodges Surely it depends which country we are in! The least worst is a politico being rude and then mocked
@CNBCWorld @jenny_cosgrave But will it benefit Europe? If it is a zero sum play then if it benefits them it must hurt somebody else
@DanielleBux @GaryLineker They look like cows to me, but hell I 'm just a townie
@BBCNews NHS = people let down by rotten processes
@GuidoFawkes @montie its a stupid question as they all think it means TO them not away from them
@JohnRentoul @AndrewGimson why does nobody ever mention their other policies. I guess vacuums are not very interesting.
@BBCNews I am prepared to donate a nicely engraved back seat for Mr Brown if he promises to take it.
@JohnRentoul love the first bit
@TimPeachBBC @bbctms everybody can see it is a sports mad lion. What's this mascot business
@JeremyCliffe yes but will she beat Hillary Clinton to the next Democratic nomination?
@Queen_Europe @David_Cameron it's the un European bit that we like the most
@FraserNelson @hugorifkind and in this regard Google as the champion of the people must win.
@bbc5live are these nonsensical debates set up to create differences or to aolve problems. It's the BBC so you know the answer
@IanLayzell1 @afneil @bbcthisweek The best thing is never in the sale!
@SkyNews do they think we didn't help them?
@SkyNews can we claim our benefits on their countries. If yes I am off!
@GuidoFawkes @montie its a stupid question as they all think it means TO them not away from them
@BBCNormanS at the expense of the English - AGAIN
@steve_hawkes @schofieldkevin this is unacceptable and should not stand.
@BBCNews @MarkReckless don't they all just deserve themselves. Recklessness in the face of the boss. Could MR just not like bosses
@Independent would that be the Rob Liddle perfume. He often kicks up a stink. Just love him
@MrHarryCole this person is too angry to see the truth from his gut
@BBCSport YES
@SamwiseShango @BAPENUK any independent evidence
@SamwiseShango @bbc5live - and the evidence is......?
@BBCMOTD FIFA find no evidence of FIFA corruption. Gosh I am surprised
@JayneSeckerSky @PeterHoskinsSky is the handshake now the international welcome of the world?
@BBCr4today englishness burns deep inside the soul. Threaten it and reap the whirwind
@JananGanesh  I am not a big cog,  but I do agree. Less shouting and aggression but lots of light and room for us to make OUR minds up
@SkyNews brown must accept that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. England must govern England as Scotland governs Scotland
@SkyNews  Brown can't stop being Labour warhorse. "What about England" I shout
@BloombergNews Just theatrical dramatics. There are many and important things they COULD/SHOULD be doing. Don't be led - lead
@TimMontgomerie @EvanHD Evan exposed him perfectly as s shallow politico who is wearing no clothes. Great first night
@LordAshcroft @GeneralBoles we need an ENTERTAINING but forensic analysis of ALL of UKIP's policies. Most supported have no idea
@LordAshcroft @GeneralBoles this should be viewed as an opportunity to highlight UKIP's lack of and weird policies not to hit the man
@SkyNews yawn yawn - no sympathy here
@DAaronovitch @JohnRentoul they speak to swing voters so on the one hand but on the other and by the way don' say anything that scares them
@FraserNelson Time 4 Cameron to GO. Good out front - incapable of delivering stuff. His governments delivery occurs when he is elsewhere
@truemagic68 put your hand up if your surprised with his stance.  Not a movement anywhere! Still the Beeb think it is newsworthy
@Sun_Politics at last somebody who speaks for me
@jameswhartonmp @DPJHodges @BBCNews Should still split the BBC and then the English bit can concentrate on issues that interest the Anglos
@truemagic68 And if he did there would be trouble "at mill"
@IndyVoices @steverichards14 Simples - labour has to have policies supported by England. No longer force stuff through with Celtic outriders
@Dannythefink @TimMontgomerie whoever has the majority in England sets its laws. Nothing else changes
@steverichards14  Oh no it isn't. It is a big issue neglected by our Anglophobe politicos. Fear I'm leaders is never attractive!!!
@GraemeDemianyk @MrHarryCole @davidtorrance no referendum for a generation so keeping this going is Herculean and this chat is just hot air
@SkyNews @AlexSalmond please spare us the bleeding heart. The man's a rabscallion and he has forced us down a self destruct tunnel
@steverichards14 @BBCPM stop giving me problems and give me answers. No more Scots interference in my England
@Peston @BBCNews not even in my worst nightmares
@SkyNewsTonight @SkyNews we should use existing parliament. Absolutely  no more politicos and definitely no more costs
@JananGanesh @DPJHodges fully agree. Make sure Miliband helps to deliver English votes for English laws. De-confuse him please
@LouiseMensch @steve_hawkes he has conned blustered and twisted his way through this and I am not going soft in the head at this late stage
@DPJHodges salmon off his perch - very fishy. I think he is trying to cod us
@BBC_HaveYourSay @BBCWorld Can anybody tell me what our Parliaments, County, Unitary and District Councils cost. We do not want to pay more
@JohnRentoul @DPJHodges Not as cross as I am!
@TomCoghlan NO to more politicians and YES to less being spent on them. Democracy costs too much when built by self serving politicos
@LordAshcroft @Nigel_Farage NO more politicians. Target must be to reduce the cost of government
@BBCr4today @BBCNormanS We do not want more politicians. The target must be to reduce the cost of government
@TimMontgomerie @georgeeaton whatever happens we do NOT want more politicians. Target should be to reduce the cost of government
@SkyNews come on guys this is just a step nowhere near as crisis ridden as the press would like
@BBCNews @suttonnick English must make Scots accountable for their wishes and desires
@BBCWorld blah blah blah
@TimMontgomerie Me me me. An ex Tory Councillor and party member I left because of their disconnect with the people.
@PhilipDaviesMP @DPJHodges Well said and not a moment too soon. If I leave my golf club I cannot take 1/500 of the place with me
@bbc5live - If I leave my golf club I don't get to take my share of the tees, fairways and greens. I leave with nothing and so will they
@Conorpope - Couple of times before Friday and then they demerge with what they can carry
@BBCNormanS @NicolaSturgeon really hope so say the English
@anneapplebaum @FraserNelson @CharlesHMoore @hugorifkind @FT A touch too much for me!
@IsabelHardman tell them the English want a say. No oil without their share of debt
@Sun_Politics Still won't buy one with wee eck in charge
@BBCNormanS I as an English person agree and I don't agree with much of the stuff being promised. Let me have a say!!
@BBCNews 3 toffs out of touch with the  English the Barnett formula must go
@BBCNews they have done this without asking a single English person. Shame on them
@BBCNews @David_Cameron we'll he needs to get near it very quickly. Scots out of English affairs  NOW
@PeterHoskinsSky @SkyNews this is a disgrace. My country is changing and I, as an English person, have had no say
My country is being changed and I, as an English person, have not been asked! This will not do. We demand a say
@Aggerscricket @danroan  it was just fantastic. Would love to have been there
@carl_spackler74 @SeanSJG @steve_hawkes ttfn - how English. Welcome
@carl_spackler74 @SeanSJG @steve_hawkes the English
@GuidoFawkes what sort of closet was it?
@carl_spackler74 @SeanSJG @steve_hawkes this is a demerger not independence. You will leave on our terms.
@carl_spackler74 @steve_hawkes @SeanSJG Good. None of these decisions should be made without vote from English. West Lothian question first
@DPJHodges Rather than Gordon be celebrated I would rather the Scots leave - preferably with Gordon
@JohnRentoul Scots should understand this is a Demerger and not an independence vote. We will negotiate hard - they will leave with nothing.
@DPJHodges By the way. Where is Cleggy on this important (sic) question?
@DPJHodges Come on. This is not about independence for Scotland. It is about Scotland demerging from the UK. On our terms!
@TomCoghlan insignificance means the politicos will have to concentrate on domestic issues - sounds good to me
@afneil English will be appalled if Cameron gives up any thing to keep then semi on board. If they want to let 'em go.
@DPJHodges give the English a vote and yes will win!
@TomCoghlan if they go, ENIW(England N Island and Wales!) set the exit terms and what they can take with them - little
@DanHannanMEP we need to get plugged into this nonsense
@DanHannanMEP this has been bubbling for a while
@DanHannanMEP kettles - my advice is just to let off steam
@SkyIanKingLive @IanKingSky Will they fund psychiatrists for the local residents. The noise will drive them MAD
@Ed_Husain @JohnRentoul  A silly policy that is more about politicians words rather than action. Lock them up and down the consequences
@GuidoFawkes Puff &amp; wind. Loaded questions, loaded times, there is still opportunity for sense to prevail. Carswell doesn't like the heat
@BitebackPub @IainDale  the austerity chancellor who has borrowed more than Gordon Brown. Don't pull the other one - pull them both
@ZeddRebel @IainDale whole heartedly agree. Only describe in the most clinical detail absolutely NO embellishment or description
@bbc5live Can never work out why running and jumping costs the taxpayer so much money
@JohnRentoul Is this substance abuse?
@MrHarryCole The only thing to say about the general public is that they are more unreliable than politicians.
@MrHarryCole So who will choose the participants - hope it isn't the same lot who choose the BBC Question Time audience
@DPJHodges - so much talk so little said
@DPJHodges would be even worse for them if they focused on his policies
@DPJHodges not for the Tories!
@steve_hawkes love the way Hastings and Grieve dissed wind farms whilst Ollie demonstrated a complete ignorance of the economics
@DanHannanMEP feels like a problem with no solution. Pass the off button. Let THEM resolve it in their way.
@HuntyCaller @bbc5live we should get wee eck to liven them up
@tonguetweets @danroan Me too
@BloombergNews This is the most appalling ruling I can imagine in a democracy. It must be reversed. Come on democrats
@bbccouk @BBCSport Peeling potatoes on the couch for me
@EddieWoolley13 @danroan  Not more sport!!! Pass me the bottle. How long does this lot go on for? Mind you Alex Salmon might liven it all up
@steve_hawkes @yorkierosie @GuidoFawkes but if a man wanted on the list and was excluded on grounds of gender - what then
@CNBCWorld @CNBC that guy on now sounds like the man from Galaxy Quest
@iankatz1000 @afneil if they were why go with Newsnight a leftie prog with no balance and with few viewers
@MrHarryCole @simonsketch Don't you mean Vague vs Beagle?
@BenPBradshaw  I suggest you may be making a cheap political point. My advice is to try to move up the value chain
@SophyRidgeSky Gadzooks, he's not a woman is he?
@afneil thought you had gone to bed with a wee dram
@MrHarryCole More competent women would be a good idea along with more competent men. Aaahhhhhh - more competent seems to be the key
@His_Grace and his wife and mother!
@CarlWil35586309 @truemagic68 this is the most crackpot scheme he has come up with. Many schools still struggling to deliver.
@TimMontgomerie @thetimes @mattwridley which is why we need a powerful right of centre figure to take over the BBC Trust to restore balance
@Sun_Politics we should be teaching adversity and preparing children to meet it. Already there is too much of everybody is a winner
@BBCNews let's hope it will be free wi-fi as taxpayers are footing the bill one way or another
@JewishComedians @JohnRentoul I had 2 bad drinks last night - the 13th and the 16th
@sajidjavid should it have been your home county of Worcestershire? Yes, but it never seem to receive any support. Lots of false promises
@cyclingweekly @danroan @grahamwatson10 it's only in Yorkshire because Lancashire is busy
@bbctms @HomeOfCricket @AaronFinch5 it's only in Yorkshire because Lancashire is busy
@danroan which PR guru told him to write that
@alanmills405 @TimMontgomerie seems to be a very shallow analysis. My recommendation is you go back and study a little more.
@alaniow @toryboypierce absolute nonsense
@toryboypierce @DrEvanHarris @centraluser Google censored, press censored' police turning up after innocent comments. So so sad.
@toryboypierce it is just wealthy self interested celebs trying to hide something which is why he won't say
@ClassicPixs @Dannythefink can,t believe fingers remain the same size but are now able to dabble in soooo many more pies
@hattmarris84 @IainDale not enough in most people's view.
@steve_hawkes  well they would not need to do it but for the Tour de France obviously thinking of their regular customers.
@BBCWorld  now here is somebody Google should "forget"
@AFP @steve_hawkes this forget lark is criminal and needs to be revoked IMMEDIATELY
@DanHannanMEP Berlin correspondent said Cameron "completely" isolated except for Hungary. So not completely isolated. BBC insult Hungary
@EdConwaySky house prices which are unaffordable now are still INCREASING
@BBCScotlandNews @BBCNews all this will change if they vote to go
@Peston @BBCNews being in work is a boom compared with being unemployed. So living standards are rising
@afneil not new! In gas industry they are called interruptible supplies
@BBCr4today it was not long ago that living too long was going to ruin the NHS. Nhs needs to use what it has better
@Sun_Politics governors should become equivalent to non-exec directors and heads should be executive. Not as present
@His_Grace Anne for Chairman of the BBC
@FraserNelson zZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzxxxxxxxxxxxZzzzzzzzzzzzz. Wot is there a story there
@BBCNews @suttonnick zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
@CNBCWorld @3cambrai outside London house prices are about 6 x avge earnings and are going up at about 3 x wage increases. Madness
@BBCNews outside London house prices are about 6 x avge earnings and are going up at about 3 x wage increases. Madness - no happy ending
@toryboypierce no issue with immigrants, they are good for us, but don't like the rate of immigration. The speed of change is not manageable
@louisabojesen @CNBCWorld What is "far right" Used to describe broad base from free market to racist. Brings free marketeers into disrepute
@JohnRentoul @MikeAaronhall if you rob Peter to pay Paul, Paul will always vote for you. Too many voters can't make hard decisions
@truemagic68 I cannot understand why in the face of this type of criticism the BBC foes not recruit from a more diverse pool. They are 2cosy
@MrHarryCole Anne Widdicombe is perfect to change the place
@FraserNelson  I vote for Anne Widdicombe. That would challenge them
@BBCNormanS if insufficient money is given for this which is usual practice schools will have to rob educational budgets
@bbc5live Thursday 3rd April - hit a hole in one at Las Colinas in Spain, fell over walking off the tee and ended up in plaster on crutches
@SkyNews Anne Widdicombe  for the BBC
@BBCNews I am referring to the causes of the deaths and how we reduce them which we must do. Education education education
@BBCNews this is a prime exams of how to mis-interpret stats. Aim should be to stop them smoking and drinking
@His_Grace @MoJPress I think more likely the judge should resign
@His_Grace @LouiseMensch in what way "unthinkingly" perhaps in the way you went into and then out of parliament. Some people do think!
@danny_webster   I am also with His Grace. The number of people using food banks is directly proportional to the number of food banks.
@bbc5live also depends on extent of children's sen needs I. E. Statemented children
@bbc5live sen funds do not cover the full costs of providing individual care so if too many sen children then school can suffer
@FraserNelson @alexmassie  if they go they can have the government they want and English can have the one they want. Hurrah no more Labour
@daily_politics @afneil why do I have to pay for just having the a device that gives me the means to watch rather than watching
@SkyNews @Nigel_Farage
@SophyRidgeSky  I am a school governor and this is the most crackpot idea of the decade. AND it's underfunded and not thought through.
@BBCNormanS @LBC973 it's not about who is here it is about the numbers coming
@LordAshcroft or a navigator,or co-pilot, or mechanic or an air traffic controller - life is a little more complicated
@BBCNews children need 2 be exposed to adversity in varying degrees to get 1st hand experience. Not big mind changing stuff but small issues
@BBCNews Coincidentally the worst rain for years!
@BBCNews Awful use of the word de-train on the poster and I thought the word was created in the us. Shame on us
@jameskirkup When the rate of immigration exceeds a tipping point the rate of cultural change becomes too much for the indigenous population
@FraserNelson @MatthewdAncona these big beasts are not leaders but are exponents of the focus group. They do not have the right solutions
@PeterHoskinsSky @JeffRandallLive  We do not want house prices back at the 2007 peak so take action now
@bbc5live @tonylivesey @MartinSLewis please no more Martin Lewis promoting Martin Lewis
@JeffRandallLive the negative side of excessive immigration is not an economic issue but a rate of cultural change issue
@truemagic68 with this lot in charge of economics the moon may
be the best place to be
@EdConwaySky this is not a home buying subsidy it is a get the Tories re-elected subsidy. It will cost us very dear indeed
@SkyNews  servicing high mortgages is the economics of the madhouse so let's reduce house prices. George wake up - NOW
@EdConwaySky high house prices reduce young people's options as both have to work to sustain high mortgage repayments
@EdConwaySky reducing house prices is the best way to get first time buyers on the housing ladder not unsustainable debt
@SkyNews Westminster Bridge on Sunday a disgrace with over 20 "find the lady" gambling games run by East Europeans. Another law not enforced
@SkyNews it's not about economics  it's about too rapid cultural change and overloading already over stretched infrastructure
@LordAshcroft all Labour are going to do is to spend 17 months investigating the energy market. Why don't the Tories do it now.
@afneil labour going to spend 17 months doing am energy market review why don't Tories do one now
@afneil Tories need to announce complete public investigation of the energy market to identify super normal profits and market improvements
@JeffRandallLive she has a vested interest in people switching so take her advice with a large pinch of salt
@BBCBreakfast @BBCNews @Ed_Miliband where was Ed when the Guardian attacked Cameron's father. The Guardian is a vicious mean minded rag
@FraserNelson people are not blind they know he speaks of austerity whilst spending like a politician - which is why he lacks crdibility
@skynewsniall @SophyRidgeSky people should not get "money for nothing" - Dire Straits
@benedictbrogan @BBCr4today hooray. At last somebody fighting for the English language

@BBCr4today the shortage of houses made much worse by Labour allowing uncontrolled immigration on a massive scale
@GuidoFawkes nonsense comment as house prices determined by credit availability and people will over-extend themselves as history shows
@BBCBreakfast Opposers of privatisation talk about employees and not customers other than the minimal nos. that live in the remotest areas
@SquawkBoxEurope apple doesn't get concept of low cost only wants to squeeze the pips hence it only serve to entice people to trade down
@SquawkBoxEurope after the hype there will be an up tick and then it's down, lost its special cache and now just a struggling tech company
@TimMontgomerie Cameron has taken leave of his senses
@afneil cannot understand what Cameron and Haigh are thinking about. At this stage they should hesitate and listen to the country
@NBCNews @CNBCWorld revenge and objectivity are not mutually compatible
@EuroWadhwa miss you from Cnbc. It is diminished by your absence. Please tweet in English.
@BBCNews absolutely not. Look at the mess we have made everywhere we have intervened. We have no money no forces and no resolve. Keep away
@BBCSport they are illegal, unfair and un-sportsmanlike. No place for them in golf. Tell him not to bother and get on with his game
@bbc5live colin macmillan, golfer, voluntary worker, ex-councillor, good looking, charming. school governor, husband, father. A normal Colin
@truemagic68 Masters no longer a major as it has prostituted itself to the tiger show. Committee have demeaned a great great game
@truemagic68 Takes 2 to be divisive. Maggie elected 3 times by the country. The left divided with her and the country. Left is divisive
@EuroWadhwa silvia, good to hear from you. Where have you been. Life is improved with your commentary. Cheers
@BBCNewsnight if deposit holders are accountable for bank failures then government should desist from forcing them to lend
@3cambrai @hugodixon Thanks. If you could see my grey hair you would understand my lack of competence in this technology thingy
#skypapers if deposit holders are being held account for bank failures the tell government not to force banks to lend
@Hugodixon any chance of a Cypriot phrase book
@truemagic68 if deposit holders are now at risk if banks collapse governments should back off from forcing them to lend
@His_Grace better when you are trying to be funny rather than a moral questioner
@kelly_evans cyprus only done what UK. Has done to savers by keeping interest rates low and inflation high. Nobody can be trusted
@TimMontgomerie Not enough Tory MP's come from business background too many professional professionals
@TimMontgomerie Tories must become the party of business big and small as small cannot do it without big to feed off.
@TimMontgomerie gov'ts cannot cure poverty only alleviate it. Business and enterprise to the rescue. Tories now seen as anti- business
@OpenEurope in a normal world these would be one integrated budget and would be considered as one. But this is the surreal world of the EU
@TimMontgomerie anybody who has campaigned against the LibDems knows they have always been free of principles.  Face at least 2 ways on all
@frasernelson never mind the BBC do you think Cameron and Milliband will ever get it!
@BBCSport and what about Blackberry
@BBCNews a stupid question. The real question is at what salary should people stop receiving benefits whether they are strivers or shirkers
@BBCNews tell me at what salary should benefits not be paid? £60k sounds more than reasonable to me as its 2.5 times the avge wage
@BeccyMeehan  or are you in the North West?
@BeccyMeehan keep up the good work and stay on our screens
Been to Museum of Science and Industry today in Manchester. Ab Fab. Must make sure it gets all the funding it needs.
@LadyAlissa guess I am not going to win. Good for you
@LadyAlissa I agree with you and Lady T was a great believer in that as well. I guess we are of a similar mind with me being more temperate
@LadyAlissa this comment says much more about you than her
@BBCr4today @Harvard  First make sure you don't listen to the moaning windbags on R4 Today. They are masters of creating dissatisfaction
@truemagic68 perhaps for the first time in many many years Obama will stop campaigning at last and get on with the job
@rachelburden. Richard Bacon is far too fond of himself to be a decent broadcaster
@louisabojesen
@louisabojesen where was your normal "bysie bye" sign off. A mere "bye" is not good enough!
@louisabojesen where was your usual sign off "bysie bye." A mere "bye" is not what I expect.
George Osborne the balance of people contributing to tax vs those not will have to be rebalanced soon to save our kids from ruin
Tell Monty to enjoy the golf and lighten up. I have had to. Turn up the brilliance on my TV to compensate for his misery
Can somebody gag the miserable whiney moany Colin Montgomery before I top myself
@BloombergNews. Is this a hanging?
@BBCBreaking is there any chance she would like to play with struggling 13 handicapper for her first game - thought not!
@bbc5live time for Bacon to be replaced by somebody less self absorbed with them selves
@truemagic68 let's ban the question "how do you feel?" Without it most of BBC reporters would be struck dumb. I am not impressed.
@bbc5live john sopel should go back to quizzing politicians not disappointed cyclists. He showed zero empathy in trying to allocate blame
"Pendleton and Varnish" bbc trying to force an issue out of it and have already started search for the guilty party
@BeccyMeehan. Having spoken the truth he should have stuck with it. Now he looks plain daft.
@BeccyMeehan I got one too. Now £75 poorer. Thought I was in restaurant car park but it was pay and display. Food was good.
@BeccyMeehan I got a ticket as well. Now £75 poorer. Thought I was in restaurant car park but it was actually pay and display. Food was good
@BeccyMeehan Who on earth would let HR do their hiring? Managers should recruit their own people with HR in a secondary advisory capacity
@BBCr4today growth was never real for people. It was driven by immigration and the debt boom. Take these factors our and growth disappears
@BeccyMeehan when people buy property in Spain do they normally use a spanish bank or a home country bank
@SkyNews politicians know we don't like or regard them and their proposal is even  more of them. Baahhh!!!
@BeccyMeehan The EU elite talk endlessly of a proper central bank. EXACTLY how will it be held accountable, who sets and monitor its targets
@BeccyMeehan EU is primarily an opaque and unaccountable  political construct and the Euro, debt and fiscal union is a subsidiary failure
@BeccyMeehan Politicians failed to regulate,overspent for years, were only interested in their re-election and then hide by blaming banks
@BeccyMeehan. Central banks have a subordinate role to play. This is and was always a political crisis with visionless politicians frozen.
#wrongtostrike
@louisabojesen The EU is in a political not an economic crisis. All the economic solutions worsen the democratic deficit alienating people
@BeccyMeehan Thinking today. Not greedy bankers alone. They have been ably supported by weak political leaders, Berlusconi and then Sarkozy

@BeccyMeehan Growth is led by either domestic or overseas demand. Gov't must focus on home markets. We cannot grow the world.
@BeccyMeehan Still buying things but everything we buy is made abroad so we are stimulating other countries not the UK. Tell us what to buy!
@BeccyMeehan We should hunt down, expose and fire the useless stress testers. It was a pathetic PR exercise.
@bigangryblkguy @ConstableNathan #racitory #iPhone4S #Sprint Now we have had the hype I'm off to buy Blackberry 9900
@BeccyMeehan The West needs a successful strategy to repatriate manufacturing from the East and the US is beginning to understand this
@BeccyMeehan I see no real understanding of what is required for growth  or single minded dedication to growth from any country
@BeccyMeehan The UK search for growth is hopeless unless Europe seriously adopts growth policies and repents its past pursuit of regulation

@louisabojesen whilst the EU financial crisis has been happening how many idiotic anti business laws has the EU parliament enacted
@BeccyMeehan don't look solely at what EU politicos are doing with our money continue to scrutinise all their anti business legislation
@BeccyMeehan regulation suppresses business growth where is the EU plan to release business from 1000's of anti-employment rules.
@BeccyMeehan where are all the European free marketers. We need then to shout loudly to get the EU regulation  monkey off our backs
@BeccyMeehan we can rely totally on the EU to always make the wrong decision. Subterfuge, incompetence and regulation is not the way ahead
@BeccyMeehan Can't have confidence in politicians as they dissemble the facts. Growth will not return until deficits  reduced massively
Lib/dems have no followers, few MP's and no policies that anybody understands. Why do we talk about them
@louisabojesen this is a deficit problem not a debt problem
Sam Coates wants people to break the law so he and his ilk can make money
Consumers will not spend until deficits are SEEN to be eliminated. They are not stupid
Consumers will not spend therefore whatever gov'ts do there will be no growth
Stop discussing elusive growth. Debate how to manage in no growth world.
I will never watch Ross. He laughs at people not with them
The most depressing thing about Darling's memoirs is that they ALL put part above nation
Why should I send rather than save. Not for our politicians.
There will be no growth without the consumer. All coomentators are detached from improvished spenders
BBC says Hunt has done a U-turn. Nonsense he did NOT turn he reacted to News Int decision to not hove off Sky News
Never thought I'd feel sorry for News International, but I do
The bbc has gone orgasmic. A vibrating jelly in a leftie mold dying of self interest
Journos talking about journos, journos talking about politicos, politicos talking about journos, politicos talking about poiticos, aaarrrgh
They can't do me for searching for info so tell me how to find all the injunction gossip
Just joined this community. How do I use it?
