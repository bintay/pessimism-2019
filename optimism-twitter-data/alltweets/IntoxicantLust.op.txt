Currently experiencing the first mood.
Basically I have two moods.
-Sleep is for the weak.
-Sleep for a week.
[Rolls my eyes.] Kai, just do the dares Aless tells you to do and quit being a big baby.
[Wraps my arms around @SvelteVehement.] Hello, baby girl! @InfamousHavoc
I'm tempted to play Truth or Dare right now.
[Blows you a kiss.] 
Ooh. I do enjoy a little S&amp;M action. [Claps my hands.] 
Technically, it's already Mother's Day for me.
Never used one and never will. Who needs condoms anyway? [Shrugs my shoulders.] 
I THINK EXPECT ANYTHING FROM YOU. 
I will be at some point. I expect a great gift from you. Since I'm such an awesome mother. [Inserts hair-flip.] 
[Chuckles softly at @PoisonedBitch and points at the table.] I made breakfast. You like pancakes?
Nothing's wrong. [Shakes my head, smiling at @InfamousHavoc.]
OH HELL NAH. 
[Blurs in front of @DarkenedFox, a cold smile gracing my lips.] It's not an order. [Snatches the bottle back.] It's a suggestion.
Okay, time to get to replies then.
That was #ooc by the way.
My mom's touchy this fine evening. Alright. [Takes a deep breath in order to not kill anyone.]
I have to get up in 6 hours but I can't fucking sleep.
#LustOut
||Tomorrow's Sunday and I gotta work, so I better go to sleep right now. RPs and SLs will be replied as soon as I get back.||
#BBL
If I see him talking shit about my daughter one more time...I'm killing the dude. And no one will or can stop me.
[I hear @PoisonedBitch coming towards the kitchen and I welcome her with a smile.] Good morning, sleepy head.
[Dramatically gasps.] YOU WOULDN'T. 
Awkward moment when you /know/ that your daughter's watching you having sex. [Side-eyes.]

Judgy.

{Makes a grimace at @SatanicBelle.} Oops. I forgot. Sorry. {Chuckles softly.}
Ah, I'm Caroline Forbes, @PsychoKillerDS. Only beautiful words come from my mouth. {Chuckles and finishes off the bottle of bourbon.}
It'll be fine eventually. I promise. {Presses a soft kiss on @SatanicBelle's cheek.} Thank you for being here for me.

You really got me now~
That's the spirit, @PsychoKillerDS. Just be you, and fuck every judgemental cunt around here, because they're not worth your time.
Those people...they're not even worth the calories I burn talking about them. {Flashes @SatanicBelle a small smile.} So don't worry.
{Laughs softly at @PsychoKillerDS' response and turns to look at him.} Personally, I don't consider you an asshole. If that matters at all.
{Rests my chin on @SatanicBelle's shoulder, shrugging mine.} No. But I will be.
{Sighs and leans against the couch, before taking a deep breath.} Thanks for listening to my drama, @PsychoKillerDS. {Chuckles softly.}
{Shuffles closer to @SatanicBelle and wraps my arms gently around her, exhaling a soft sigh.}
And how can you be certain about who plans to stick around, @PsychoKillerDS? {Averts my gaze and takes another deep sip.}

That's just a pettite detail, @PsychoKillerDS. Nothing important. {Chuckles and clings my bottle to his.} Cheers, Salvatore.
Hey! {Chuckles and grabs the bottle from @PsychoKillerDS.} Get your own. {Pokes my tongue out to him and takes a large sip.}
{Hops onto @PsychoKillerDS' couch after I've grabbed a bottle of bourbon from his stash. I pat the space beside me and pop the bottle open.}
Then I guess you're in. 
I never joke about a serious issue like this. 
{Chuckles.} I'm in the mood of getting drunk. Are you in? 
Good. {Nudges my hip with yours.} 
It takes a lot more than that to piss me off, Damon. Trust me. 
Even after last night. {Nods and flashes you a smile.} 
Well. No, I actually like you. 
{Clings my bottle of bourbon with @OrneryCynosure's one, before taking a large sip.}
{Volunteers.} 
Cheers to people who pretend to be friends and turn out to be cunts! {Knocks back a glass of vodka.}
Fuck off. All of you.
Losing yet /another/ friend and RP partner. {Shrugs my shoulders.} Inevitable.
#Back, by the way.
Now who's the slut? {Coughs and smiles angelically.}
This, {Points at the bottle.} Isn't yours, @DarkenedFox. Get your own alcohol and leave mine alone.
Shower time. #BBS

{Huffs and tilts my head to look at @broodysalvatore.} Seriously?
{Rolls my eyes at @DarkenedFox.} I'm not /that/ stupid, Kol. And not that easily tempted.
Not fair. {Mumbles childishly, making puppy eyes up at @broodysalvatore.}

You think...what? {Murmurs, watching each one of @broodysalvatore's movements carefully.}
Next time you ask a girl to play Monopoly with you, make sure you don't mean the game. So she doesn't bring you the board game.

I'm feeling particularly blonde this morning, @broodysalvatore. Mind telling me already? {Chuckles playfully.}

I want to smoke weed. I've never done it. Someone pass me a blunt.
{Tilts my head to the side.} Don't avoid my question with another question, @broodysalvatore.
@FearingGodzilla I thought about going, but nah. Too lazy for this shit.
{Cuddles my bourbon to my chest.} It didn't do anything wrong, @DarkenedFox!
@FearingGodzilla See?! The Black Keys slay!
Oi. I'm one of Damon's favorite girls.

Nope. I wanted to play Scrubble.

Perfect.
Oh, you don't? {Smiles playfully at @broodysalvatore and folds my arms over my chest.}

{Raises a brow at @broodysalvatore.} I'm sure you meant something naughty. The real question is what exactly.
#NP Evanescence - Going Under
THE BLACK KEYS. 
Nope. I wasn't.
The real question is what did /you/ think /I/ meant, @broodysalvatore? {Tilts my head to the side.}

I didn't imply anything, @broodysalvatore. {Shakes my head.}

#NP Kaiser Cheifs - Coming Home

Of course you can, @broodysalvatore. I'm Caroline Forbes. You love me. {Chuckles and pulls back.}
My heart is just too dark to care,

Ow! {Turns and looks at @DarkenedFox before throwing the shoe back at him.} You're mean!
Of course it is. I said it.
{Bursts out laughing and attempts to hold @broodysalvatore on my back.} OW. You're heavy, bunny boy!
{Just keeps acting crazy, without noticing @DarkenedFox.}
{Wraps my arms around @broodysalvatore into a tight hug.} You're welcome.

No need to thank me, @broodysalvatore. I really do wish your writer the best.
You're welcome, @broodysalvatore. Oh, and if you need anyone to talk to, my DMs are open for you.
Candice Swanepoel?
No worries, @broodysalvatore. I hope your writer is better.

Genius Damon strikes again. 
@PsychoKillerDS 
And how are you so sure that you won't get me back? {Folds arms in front of my chest.}
@PsychoKillerDS I win every round.
It will be fucking awkward if he's not talking about me.
@PsychoKillerDS Glad we agree.
{Raises an eyebrow.} Why would you want me back?
No. 
@PsychoKillerDS Thank God.
@ErraticFelon That's all, I guess. {Takes a deep breath.}
@PsychoKillerDS Seriously?!
@PsychoKillerDS /Mine/, you moron.
@ErraticFelon Okay, okay. I just want you to know that I'll be around if you need anything. Just...this.
{Facepalms.} @PsychoKillerDS
@ErraticFelon I want to know if you are. I'd hate if you were mad at me after what we had.
{Just blinks up at @PsychoKillerDS.} You know I'm not Bonnie, right?
@ErraticFelon Are you mad at me?
@ErraticFelon It isn't and you know. I want to make things right.
@ErraticFelon Seriously? You think everything is fine between us?
@PsychoKillerDS 
@ErraticFelon Wait. Just...ugh. I'm so confused right now. Can we please talk about it?
@ErraticFelon To what..?
Am I Goldilocks...?
Go to sleep, B. See ya tomorrow.
Exactly. @ValiantHellion
@PsychoKillerDS @ValiantHellion Let's make a sex tape and be rich.
Elena was as stiff as your bed post. Just saying. @ValiantHellion
Well...yeah. A girl has needs. @ValiantHellion
She is /horrible/. I was just trying to be polite. But nah. @ValiantHellion
She was mediocre. I did all the job. 
@PsychoKillerDS 
Nevermind. Forget about it.
What did I even fucking do to you?
How do I even do that, Bonnie? {Is confused as fuck.}
I may want the D, but not /your/ D. 
Feel free to unfollow me if you hate me that much.
I call it honesty. 
I do /not/. 
{Face-desk.} 
Nope. Killer, give Bonnie the D.
Pft. Don't expect me to stroke it. Go to Bonnie. 
{Passed fries to Bonnie and bourbon to Damon and makes /everyone/ happy except of myself.}
Poor you. Guess you won't be giving the D to anyone tonight. 
{Starts singing.} Damon and Bonnie, sitting on a tree...
BUUUUURN. 
I have bourbon.
Pft, fine. Your cock's safe.
{Makes @PsychoKillerDS and @ValiantHellion my new friends. Whether they like it or not. I don't give a fuck.}
{FUCKING DIES LAUGHING.} 
That was a joke, for fuck's shake. {Rolls my eyes skywards.}
Anyone who would mute you just proves to be a pathetic loser, Damon. #EndOfStory
Well...you're good at that.
Yes...how did you know, Bonnie?
Why would I mute you? I love having you on my TL.
Not you, Killer.
I'll be taking the next step pretty soon.
Threesome? Threesome. You, me and Damon. I'm in.
Nope, it was a mistake unmuting him. {Re-mutes.}
Damon should behave or else I'll cut his D.
{Makes sure @PoisonedBitch is asleep and gently drags a blanket above her sleeping form, before tip-toeing out of her room.}

Descriptive and Litterate 

Looking for all TVD/TO mains 

Any Ship - But Mostly Tyler and Liv or Kol and…
Bonnie /should/ get the D.

And Caroline should get th D.

{Coughs.}
{Thinks about it for a while.} Mkay. {Starts narrating to @PoisonedBitch the fairytale "The Beauty And The Beast".}
{Tucks @PoisonedBitch into bed and sits beside her.} What fairytale do you like the most?
@PoisonousElixir @PoisonedBitch Okay but GO TO BED NOW.
WOOHOO! 
Agreed. {Fist pumps.} 
I don't believe you. {Shakes my head.}
A Salvatore is retweeting porn on my TL. {Shifty.}
Stop playing the innocent one, dear Bonnie. It's no shame to get the D from someone good.
{Cracks up.} 
It's pretty obvious you finally got the D from someone better than little Gilbert.
I'm putting LonelyLosers to my bio because why not.
Bonnie's especially naughty this morning. {Narrows eyes suspiciously.}
Let's all be sucky friends together.
I BELIEVE IT'S NECESSARY.  
OKAY! 
Should we make a public announcement about our grant opening? 
I suck at making new friends, but...I guess you only live once.

Well. Not if you're immortal. Whatever.
I like that. {Pumps my fist on the air.}  
YES! How should it be called? "Losers with no friends" is such a big name. 
I didn't mean you. Go to sleep. {Facepalms.} 
I'm freaking lovin' the idea. 
And since my old friends either aren't here or abandoned me, it's time to make new ones.
Maybe we should co-found the "Losers with no friends" club and see how many will actually join. 
I think the same every single day, but I'm too lazy and I have no friends. {Dies laughing.} 
I never regret any of my decisions, because at some point, those decisions were the right ones for me.
Best pickup line ever. 
Couldn't agree more to that one. {Applauses.}
Tell me about it, Hellion. {Shakes my head.}
When we were together, he wasn't on much. And now we broke up, he's always online. Wow...thanks.
Pst, of course. {Winks.} 
I know your voice too, Kinsley. Way before everyone else did. {Smug as fuck.}
{Fucking dies laughing.} 
Didn't need to know that...{Gags.}

You're welcome! I'm glad I helped! 
Yes. Yes you should. 
I've read the books countless times, but only seen the movie twice. I adore the certain love story as well. 
No matter what everyone says, I absolutely adore the books. And the movie isn't so bad itself. 
Same here. 
{Eats a giant bowl of chocolate ice cream, crying because I'll never have Jamie Dornan.}
@BraveBehavior You're welcome, glad I helped!
Every time I see Jamie Dornan's face I wanna cry, because I'll never have such a handsome man in my life.
#NP Ellie Goulding - Love Me Like You Do
I just check my "Who to follow" list. If I see someone I like, I follow. 
@BraveBehavior First one.
Well, you can't expect your TL to start moving by itself. And you can't just whine and do nothing to fix it. 
I need to follow more people to get my TL moving.

{Happily accepts @SatanicBelle's kisses.}
{Will be waiting, don't worry, @SatanicBelle. Feel better.}
It's 11:02 AM and I'm only hungry. No longer horny. {Coughs.}
Of course I'd get a tweet like that. {Facepalms.} 
#LovesOn my other half of "Lol", @ImpudentBigot and mommy, @IntoxicantLust.
{Presses a kiss on @SvelteVehement's forehead.} Goodnight, baby girl! I love you too!
{Tucks @SvelteVehement's human in and forces her to sleep because she needs it.}
{Will just film @SvelteVehement and Kol having sex and upload it on PornHub. And then maybe masturbate a little because hot. }
{Then @SvelteVehement will catch me having hot vampire sex with Stefan and will be scarred for a lifetime.}
It's 10:35 AM and I'm /still/ hungry and horny.
{Will turn my phone off.} @SvelteVehement
Not weird at all. 
{Will just leave the room and go to Stefan to help me with that job since @SvelteVehement ignores me.}
Yeah, that's a /completely/ normal mother-daughter relationship.
{Will moan so loudly that I'll make @SvelteVehement go deaf.}
{Will start masturbating the instant minute @SvelteVehement updates me.}
I always am. @SatanicBelle
{Makes gagging sounds.} @ImpudentBigot
And very fun to watch, @ImpudentBigot.
God, @ImpudentBigot...Hottest. Sex. Ever.
And skills and experience, @ImpudentBigot. Don't forget those.
Ah, sex is different than relationships, @ImpudentBigot. Relationships require emotions, sex doesn't.
Okay, I'm here if you do though. @SatanicBelle
Even if he doesn't, it's his loss, not mine. {Shrugs my shoulders.} Besides, life doesn't revolve around relationships. @ImpudentBigot
Wanna talk about it? {Furrows my brows.} @SatanicBelle
It won't be the same, @ImpudentBigot.
Pff, he won't. {Shakes my head, sliding my hands into my pockets.} @ImpudentBigot
That's what I'm here for, @SatanicBelle. To cheer you up and make sure no one hurts you.

You're my best friend and I love you. No one understands me like you do. @SatanicBelle
{Shudders at the thought.} Okay, @ImpudentBigot. That's enough. No need to know more.
Of course I do! {Furrows my brows at @SatanicBelle.}
Can we please not speak about it again, @ImpudentBigot?I don't care about my daughter's sex life whatsoever. {Makes puppy eyes towards him.}
{Gasps.} You wouldn't do that. I want you here. I /need/ you here. @SatanicBelle
{Gags at @ImpudentBigot's words and shakes my head.} I did /not/ need to know that.
Of course. One day you'll die and I won't. Duh. @SatanicBelle

{Chuckles and turns to look at @ImpudentBigot, raising a challenging eyebrow.} You must do far more than that if you're trying to enrage me.
Of course not. I'm just reminding you that you love me. 
I hadn't thought about that. Anyway, I'm not Barbie. I'm much tougher than that now. @ImpudentBigot
You won't do shit. You love me. 
I might not be cocky normally, but I'm as sassy as it gets.
{Smiles proudly at @ImpudentBigot.} Thanks for the compliment.
I'm hungry and horny at 9:28 am.
Oh wait, that sounds pretty normal.
I'm not 5 years old and you're not my mom. 
To do what? {Grumbles.} 
I don't blame you for not knowing my many talents, @ImpudentBigot. You don't know me. So, you're forgiven. {Flips my hair.}
Shit, I'm screwed. 
Or they just really recognise my talent, which makes /you/ the insane one, @ImpudentBigot.
{Chokes on the cookies and spits them, before glaring at you.} Sorry Mom. 
They can't /all/ be blind, @ImpudentBigot. It appears to me that /you/ have the real problem here, not them.
Kol, Greece is a beautiful country. You should definitely move in there.
Definitely. {Mumbles with my mouth full.} 
Your brother thinks otherwise, @ImpudentBigot. Along with the rest of Mystic Falls.
My definition of angel as in making birds fall in love with me. @ImpudentBigot
He murders people, so he's fun for me. 
I swear, I'm not normally /that/ cocky.
/Excuse you/, but have you heard me singing? I have the voice of an angel. @ImpudentBigot
I would definitely RP with you. 
{Presses two fingers on my temple, massaging it gently.} What did I just heard...I think my ears are bleeding. {Gags.} @ImpudentBigot
{Sighs and throws my hands up in surrender.} I give up. You two are made for each other. @ImpudentBigot
{Raises a brow.} She stabbed me with a vervain dart and locked me into the Salvatore's dungeon just because she was bored. @ImpudentBigot
Love you too. {Just watches from a distance, nomming on my cookies.} 
OR IT'LL MAKE HER SO MAD SHE'LL TURN OUR BLOOD INTO MAGMA. @ImpudentBigot
Yes you are, @ImpudentBigot! And I don't want my best friend to be mad at me, thank you very much!
{Shrugs my shouldes.} I'm on wise blonde bitch, @SvelteVehement. {Chuckles.}
"Smile. It makes people wonder what you did last night."
Aless, it's a good thing to have crazy people around you, @SvelteVehement. Because you never get bored of them. {Winks.}
Ohhh, he's twisted. I'd like to meet him one day, @SvelteVehement.
{Passes it to you.} 
He doesn't know that you wouldn't have sex with a girl, @SvelteVehement. Plus, he's a man. Which means he has a wild imagination.
I know it, @SvelteVehement. But /he/ doesn't.
Maybe "Red Velvet" will be our "always". #TFIOSMoment
Red Velvet. 
I have pie. Not tater tots. Do you want some pie? 
Noooo crying! @SvelteVehement
Aw, don't be mean to my best friend, @ImpudentBigot.
{Blinks rapidly.} Then I'm out of options. 
No buts! Let everyone think what they want to think, @SvelteVehement! {Winks.}
As long as a certain witch doesn't get jealous, I'm okay with it, @ImpudentBigot.
Well...there's nothing wrong with that, @SvelteVehement. {Shrugs my shoulders nonchalantly.}
{Claps my hands excitedly.} You're the best. {Presses a kiss on @ImpudentBigot's cheek.}
I know what you want. {Points a finger at you, smiling playfully; whispers into your ear.} /Cupcakes/. 
That's the spirit, @SvelteVehement! {Flashes her a wide smile.}
Eh. {Shrugs my shoulders.} I guess there's no point in hiding it anymore. 
Lessy: gay best friend
Davina: overall best friend
Goldi: baby momma
Bon Bon: Property of Kol
No, you're not wrong. {Huffs softly.} Just...don't tell him, mkay? @ImpudentBigot
You're more than okay, now that I'm here! {Lifts the corners of your lips upwards into an awkward smile.} Cheer up! 
{Furrows my brows.} How is it possible that /everyone/ knows about it?! 
I'm good as long as the ones I love are good. So, the real question is, how are /you/? 
{Wiggles my nose, looking at @ImpudentBigot.} It's /that/ obvious, isn't it?
|| I'm skipping school today. #LikeABoss ||
{Slides dainty digits through your hair, soothingly stroking it.} 
Pff, I'm not even into him. He's all yours. {Pats your shoulder twice.} 
{Wraps my arms tightly around you, attempting to chace the bad feelings away.} Mommy's here. 
{Comes back to life.} Pst, you won't get rid of me easily. 
{Settles on @ImpudentBigot's lap.} Don't worry. I fancy playing around but there's only one guy I'm interested in. {Flashes you a smile.}
{Chuckles and skips beside you, linking my arm with yours.} 
Oh trust me, I do. {Rolls my eyes at the thought of that particular person.} 
Cross my heart. {Nods once.} 
{Falls on the ground and dies.} 
{Pirouettes my way intp @ImpudentBigot's mentions.}
But...I've been good, I promise. 
That's a new. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
Okay then. Let's buy the puppy. 
My daughter isn't allowed to be into the bad stuff! 
{Starts running around singing.} Someone has a crush on Bonnieeeee! 
{Gasps in shock.} Baby girl?! Shame on you! 
{Lap dances for you and films it, before sending the video to Bonnie with a message.} "Be jelly xx" 
What did I do this time? {Frowns.} 
Aren't you a protecting mother. {Wipes away an imaginary tear and leans my head onto your shoulder.} 
{Points to myself.} This Goldilocks likes bad stuff. {Chuckles.} I'll be fine. I won't let him do anything to me. 
Good! {Claps my hands.} 
{Casually rolls in front of you and settles on your lap.} 
#Bonoline? Why, why do you want our puppy to be bullied by other puppies because of his name? 
Nah, don't worry. {Shakes my head.} He's a harmless puppy. 
What did I just read...{Gags.} 
{Sighs.} I didn't know you were SatanicNeurotic. But now I do. Okaaaay? {Flashes you a smile.} 
#SatanicLust sounds better. #Bonoline sounds like there's a dog with a boner. 
{Grins and presses a kiss on your cheek.} We must aknowledge the good merchandise, baby girl. {Nods once.} 
And I won't deny that feelings are mutual. 
{Nudges your shoulder with mine.} See? {Chuckles.} 
You know what I mean. {Rolls my eyes.} 
Pff, you love me. 
I think his ass, annoying or not, is rather hot. 
Finally. I have my notifications back. {Cries out of joy.}
Still. What's not to like? 
Oh thank God. {Sighs in relief.} 
Shut up. I had no idea you're Satanic. But something felt oddly familiar on you. {Eye twitches.} 
{Raises a perfect shaped brow, folding my arms over my chest.} And why do I find some difficulty in believing that? 
A run? {Grumbles.} Oookay, I guess so. 
{Mimics you, faking a gasp as well.} Yes, that would be you. 
THAT'S YOU?! DAMMIT. 
Why doesn't the damn Twitter notify me when I have a new mention? {Shoves the Twitter bird into the oven.}
Yes, it is...{Narrows my eyes suspiciously.} 
I really like the Kol I just followed. {Approves.}
What else would we possibly be talking about? 
{Laughs softly and slides my hands down to @ObscureAmity's back, stroking it softly.}
You may have one too, if you want. 
Where's @broodysalvatore? {Eye twitches.} I decided to share my cookies with him.
{Passes dainty digits through @ObscureAmity's hair soothingly, my eyes falling closed as a smile forms on my lips.}
{Chuckles and walks over my bed, plopping down on it before pulling @ObscureAmity into my embrace and the covers over our bodies.}
I'm heeeeere. @ObscureAmity
{Sighs softly.} But you at least was tortured because you did something bad, @TurbulentDevil. Bonnie did nothing bad.

{Slides into @broodysalvatore's DMs and spends the night there.} Goodnight!
I will take a quick shower and then hide in DMs until I fall asleep.
Baby girl! You're too young to be seeing those things! {Gasps.}
{Raises both brows at @broodysalvatore.} I wanna hear it. {Chuckles softly.}
{Sighs softly.} What do I have to do to make you shut up and accept the truth, @broodysalvatore? Because I'll gladly do it.
Noooo...{Protests quietly, gently pushing @broodysalvatore's chest, not really pushing him off of me.}
{Furrows my brows at @broodysalvatore in a playful manner.} Well...I just know I'm cuter than you. Everybody knows I'm cuter than you.
Jeez, I didn't steal anyone's quote. I didn't even remember Katherine had actually said that. Grow up, people.
I'm a woman, @broodysalvatore. That thing alone is enough to prove everyone that I'm cuter than you. {Smiles playfully.}
{Stares up at @broodysalvatore, placing both hands on his shoulders.} How?
{Raises an eyebrow towards @broodysalvatore.} You /think/ you're right. But you're not. {Murmurs playfully.}
{Gently bites down at @broodysalvatore's finger.} I'm right and you know it, Hero Hair. {Mumbles.}
Anytime sweetheart @FlawlessGilbert.
This one, @DesirousSin and @LeucousGlamor. Although I'm only on this one for now. 
Still. Barbie is cuter than Ken. {Simply nods towards @broodysalvatore.}
Because I'm practically the alive version of Barbie, @broodysalvatore. {Flips my hair cockily,shoots you a playful smile} You can't beat me.
{Arches both brows, eyes opening in surprise as I gasp.} What?! Oh hell no, @broodysalvatore! You can't beat me!
Okay, the match is over. {Coughs slightly, returning to my normal self.}
{Huffs and does my best puppy eyes at @broodysalvatore.} Seriously? I don't think so. I think you are cute. Not as cute as I am, though.
FUCK YEAH! NEYMAR, MY BABY, YOU ARE THE KING!
{Chuckles and smooches @broodysalvatore's cheek.} Shush you. You know I'm right. I'm always right.
Hell no, @broodysalvatore. When you're with me, you'll be your real, cute self. {Taps your nose, getting comfortable on top of you.}
{Leans into @broodysalvatore's touch, my smile becoming warmer.} Awww, aren't you cute.
Of course I did. {Settles atop @broodysalvatore, smiling brightly down at him.} I was miserable without you.
SECOND GOAL!

@AGeminiWitch I didn't see Germany scoring though. {Winks.}

Oi, fireworks in the sky. I love fireworks. {Claps my hands.}
{Pokes the shit out of @broodysalvatore.} Where are youuuuu?!
Yes, you are. 
I. Am. Not. Your. Freakin'. Nanny. 
Stop singing. You won't succeed anything. 
I'm not mean. {Rolls my eyes.} 
I'm no one's play thing. {Rolls my eyes.} 
Noooo! 
WHATEVER. 
No thank you. 
Yeah, yeah. {Quickly gets out and blurrs away.} 
Because I'm not your freaking nanny. 
{Huffs.} I'm done. 
I bought you a teddy. I'm not reading you a story though. 
Uhm, no thank you. I'm a free person and I'll do whatever I want. 
{Raises a brow.} Demanding much? 
How can I possibly prove it? 
Lesson learnt. 
{Huffs softly.} Okaaaaay. 
Aw, but I'll be around anytime you need me though. 
Oops, I forgot. You don't like kisses. {Rolls my eyes.} 
Whuuuut? 
{Chuckles.} I'll leave you two alone. {Wanders off.} 
{Buys a teddy and gives it to you.} Here you go! 
Let's just leave it for some other time, mkay? 
I don't usually randomly cuddle with everyone. {Chuckles.} 
I'm willing to buy you a new one. 
Maybe. We'll see. {Smiles softly.} 
{Flips my hair cockily.} Pst, I know. 
Aw, really? {Places a hand on my chest.} I'm honoured. 
I know, that's why people love me. {Smiles brightly.} 
Just saying. {Snaps my fingers into a Z line, chuckling shortly afterwards.} 
I do. Unless someone messes with me or the ones I love. Then they're automatically added to my black list. 
I respect everyone around here. 
{Shrugs my shoulders.} Oookay then, if you say you're not old, then you aren't. 
I show respect to the elderly. {Chuckles.} I'm very good, and what about you? 
Hello, Mr. Salvatore! {Salutes.} 
Hello, hello!
Okay. Work time. #BBL
Me and @broodysalvatore slay on my header. #SwagModeActivated

More like a human lunch, @broodysalvatore. But that works too.
I'm adorable, I know. 
Lunch. #BBS
{Blows you a kiss.} 
I'll be sassy if I want to. {Snaps my fingers into a Z line.} 
{Leans my chin on @broodysalvatore's shoulder, smiling widely up at him.} Oh, you so do.
Leave. My. Mom. Out. Of. This. 
You know you love me, @broodysalvatore. {Presses a kiss on your cheek.}
Leave my mom out of this. {Points a finger at you.} 
I'm always happy when you do what I want. {Pats @broodysalvatore's cheek.}
@broodysalvatore ||Hahahah, aggreed! Hop into my DMs so we can discuss about a plot.
{Claps my hands once more, smiling widely at @broodysalvatore.} Bravo, bravo!
She doesn't know where I hide it. {Winks back at you.} 
{Makes puppy eyes.} Not even for me, @broodysalvatore? Your favorite blondie?
Pff, I already know that, @broodysalvatore. {Smiles proudly.}
Good luck with finding it. {Beams brightly.} 
{Laughs and claps my hands excitedly.} Do that again! @broodysalvatore
{Dances around @broodysalvatore.}
Doing it secretly is better. Gets the adrenaline going, you know? 
{Furrows my brows at @broodysalvatore and punches his arm.} Meanie.
Not all girls are the same though.
But...I wanna know about them. {Juts out my lower lip.} 
Shush! {Covers @broodysalvatore's mouth with my palm.}

{Shrugs my shoulders.} I'll just find it again. 
Good. {Smiles brightly.}
I'm just a happy and optimistic person. There's nothing wrong to that.
Maybe...{Smiles all cutely like.} 
Give her time, @TurbulentDevil. Don't you think she's been through hell the last year?
Aparrently Goldilocks, Blondie Doll and Chatty Girl are my new nicknames.
In that case...thanks for the compliment. {Flashes a wide smile.}
We'll see about that. {Taps your nose.} 
I believe she has a very good reason to not like you, @TurbulentDevil. {Arches both of my brows and chuckles softly.}
Ah ah ah, you misspelled that. Dear Diary, I have the /biggest/ crush on Goldilocks, from Mr. Hero Hair. 
I'm an open book. Put some effort and get to know me. 
Am I the chatty one?
@DepravedMinx @SalvatoreMother No worries at all.
Ever since you turned me, I've come to have more snark than before. Weird thing, huh? 
{Looks around innocently.} I, Caroline Forbes, solemnly swear that I'm an innocent girl. 
Please, be my guest. {Winks.} 
I like people who are sassy and you, @TurbulentDevil, are one. {Claims you as my new friend.}
{Bats my eyelashes innocently.} Oh me? I'm a good girl, I promise. 
Then I'm in. Let's bond over killing people. {Smiles playfully.} 
Pain is good. {Nods multiple times with a wide smile.} Well, not all kinds of pain. 
There's a difference in /acting/ cute and /being/ cute. And no, I can't say the same. After all you're older, right? 
@SalvatoreMother @DepravedMinx Trust me, it's not mean. It's what everyone should do in order to keep a decent RP going.
I'll savour the feeling and I'll be anxiously waiting for your next one, @TurbulentDevil. {Nods once, flashing a smile.}
{Gasps, shocked.} When you're with me, you'll /smile/ until your lips fall off of your face. 
@SalvatoreMother @DepravedMinx Oh God, same here. Like, /everyone/ can smirk. Can you do anything else beside that?
Is that...a compliment I hear, @TurbulentDevil? {Places a hand on my chest.} I feel honoured.
I would have done the same if I were you. {Nods once in approval.} 
@Elenavamp30 A little honesty never hurt anyone.
Is that so? {Raises a challenging brow.} 
Blondes are cuter than brunettes. 
{Fails to keep a straight face and laughs, twisting the corners of your lips into a smile.} Smile! 
I certainly do love your personality, @TurbulentDevil. After all, we're all mad here. #MadHatterModeActivated
@Elenavamp30 Exactly.
What. The. Hell. {Shakes my head.} 
Nah, they don't deserve it. But don't let me stop you. It'll be fun to watch. 
{Narrows my eyes suspiciously.} Don't tell me you consider yourself as cute? 
You tell me, Mr. Hero Hair. {Bumps my hip to yours.} 
That's a new one. From having no Kai's on my TL to having two of them. {Enjoys it.}
@Elenavamp30 I tend to do that, to be honest. But at least I have the decensy to inform my RP partner that I don't wish to continue our RP.
Only a little...I promise. 
God, that's even /worse/. 
Like, thanks a lot. I work my butt off to make a decent starter and you never reply? Fuck off.
Sending a starter and never getting a reply &lt;&lt;&lt;
I wouldn't consider you cute, @FaultlessMalice. Ruthless, maybe. A bitch, definitely. But...cute? Nah.
{Blinks.} Mama bear?! 
{Flashes a wide grin.} Really. 
The one and only. 
You cute, @FaultlessMalice? I don't think so.
{Shrugs my shoulders.} Cliche or not, I'm still cute. 
Or a good bio.
If you have a good UN, then I will definitely follow you.
The cute one is here.
#BBL
{Dodges and avoids it.} 
Four words. {Counts with my fingers.} Me. Damon. Stefan. Threesome. 
{Shrugs my shoulders.} Just saying. 
@PoisonousElixir Love you too.
I can still have fun. Just get me one of your brothers and you'll see. 
@PoisonousElixir {Chuckles softly and presses a kiss on your cheek.}
{Rolls my eyes and zips my lips.} 
@PoisonousElixir We broke up. {Shrugs my shoulders.} And I don't want to talk about it. {Smiles widely.}
You are one too. And an older one, actually. {Raises a brow.} 
YOU BROKE MY WRIST. What was I supposed to do?! 
@PoisonousElixir I didn't tell anyone. I just needed a character change.
Oh, I know. You put me in here. Bitch. {Groans again and stands up.} 
@PoisonousElixir But why?
{Wakes up a few hours later, groaning.} 
@PoisonousElixir Hey, Kins.
{Considers breaking your spine all #Balky style before passing out.} 
EVA. You, me, Katherine, threesome.
{Casually kicks you on the knee, breaking it.} Bitch. 
If she disappeared I'll kill her.
Evaaaaa, have a threesome with me and Katherine.
@FormidableTease Sounds good. I can ask her. I'm sure she won't deny that offer.
@FormidableTease Pff, she's a harmless kitten. {Shakes my head.}
{Casually covers your eyes.} Now she is. 
@FormidableTease We don't have to tell Eva. It'll be our secret. {Nods once.}
{Rolls my eyes.} I won't. They're yours. {Winks.} 
@FormidableTease {Raises a brow.} And what's that supposed to mean?
@FormidableTease {Porn-star moans at the thought.}
{Feels the love.} 
That's a slightly disturbing thought. {Wiggles my nose before chuckling.} @SvelteVehement
@FormidableTease What is not to like? You will be in it, Rebekah will be in it, I will be in it. Heaven. {Shoots you a wink.}
@FormidableTease I'm totally in for that.
@ObscureAmity {Raises a perfect shaped eyebrow and starts porn-star moaning.}
{Is jealous about everyone grabbing their boobs; casually gropes mine.}
{Casually sits beside you, taking a fistfull of popcorn before popping it into my mouth.} 
When people say my name, I don't know if they're actually talking to me or some other Caroline. {Scratches the back of my head.}
Best motivational speech ever. 
Ever since I muted her, my TL is drama free. {Sighs contently.}
Amen. 
Lesbian sex on the TL? {Stalks and prays for it to happen.}
{Taking the bottle from @LovelyStunner, I mimic her movements, taking a strong sip from the bottle before looking at her again.} Good, huh?
#BBT
Makes two of us. 
{Flashes a wide grin towards @LovelyStunner, nodding once at her direction.} Don't mention it.
{Raises a perfect shaped eyebrow towards @LovelyStunner.} Tequila? Nice choice. {Offers her a bottle of tequila.}
What do I /possibly/ have to do to gain some friends around here? Start bribing people with alcohol?
Can the drama stop already? {Sighs.}
So, I'm searching for my mains. #Elena, #Stefan, #Bonnie, where are you? #RT
#CharacterChange
Oookay then. Slow replies since I'm changing into Caroline.
Maybe I should change into Caroline.
Considering a character change again.
Just read @BalkyVarlet's solo. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. But I might have peed my pants a little. {Gulps because I'm afraid for my life.}
I'm just saying the truth!  
Absolutely loved your solo, @GrabMyAscendant. Well done!
@MattGlassthorn I don't know. Are you? {Folds my arms over my chest.}
@MattGlassthorn {Shrugs my shoulders.} I changed character.
@ErraticFelon No pouting!
@ErraticFelon Hey handsome!
New Anastasia, not new to RP. #RT and spread the word.
Perfect! Follow me on @DesirousSin so we can discuss about the plot there. 
Seriously? Maybe I should bring back my Anastasia then. 
Eh, I don't know. No one RPed with me when I had my Anastasia. 
But then again, no one RPed with me when I had my Anastasia.
FSOG accounts make me want to create one again. Sigh.
ALESS! {Waves my hands into the air, expecting you to notice me.}
Am I the only one who's hungry? Nah, I can't be.
It's always dead at this time of the day. 
People who constantly spam the TL with automatic tweets &lt;&lt;&lt;
{Is pretty sure I misspelled that.}
{Searches for new friends around the TL with my binocaulars.}
Just realized it's Monday today. UGH.
{Gives out cupcakes to everyone because I'm bored.}
@ADeviousDelight Exactly. And when you go to sleep, they wake up. Ugh.
I know Miranda Kerr is an overused FC but...damn, I love her.
@PoisonousElixir {Chuckles.} Hello to you too.

@MattGlassthorn Well, it's her choice. Maybe she'll come back eventually, maybe not.
Someone recommend me a good movie to watch?
@MattGlassthorn What? Really?
Will do, @ADeviousDelight. Thanks for the follow as well.
#Out
And now I'm causing drama like a 13-year-old.
Or maybe not. I'll just leave. And I'm not sure when I'll come back. It's not like I'm needed anyways.
Yeah, maybe I'll just stick to DMs right now. RL is being a dick. Again.

Nah. Everything's fine as always. How are you? @FlaxenParagon
[[Links my arm with @FlaxenParagon's one, smiling softly.]]
[[Turns from @ErraticFelon to @LittlestTaco, giving her a wide smile.]] Let's cook! How about we make a chocolate cake?
[[Laughs and kisses @ErraticFelon's cheek.]] Wanna watch? @LittlestTaco
[[Chuckles at @LittlestTaco's enthusiasm.]] Of course you can help! @ErraticFelon
[[Turns to @ErraticFelon and @LittlestTaco once they enter the kitchen, smiling widely.]] And what are you two doing here?
Sooooo, it's babysit time!
Good, very good. And you? @ObscureAmity
@FlaxenParagon Let's walk.
@FlaxenParagon Sure!
@ErraticFelon Don't thank me. It's my pleasure. [[Grins brightly.]]

[[Laughs and shakes my head.]] Fiiine. @ObscureAmity
@ErraticFelon [[Raises an eyebrow.]] Practice for what?
@ErraticFelon [[Tip-toes and pecks your lips softly.]]
Aw. [[Smiles widely, pecking @ObscureAmity's cheek.]] I missed you too.

I don't think it works like that. [[Dies laughing.]] 
But first...lunch. #BBS

Whoah, is anything wrong?
Thanks, Isabelle. It's good to be back.
@DeviousRomancer Yeah. And now I'm never leaving him again.
@DeviousRomancer I left because RL problems, but I came back because I can't live without him.
@DeviousRomancer I'll take that as a yes then.
@DeviousRomancer Oh oh...am I in trouble?
I don't care, I love it! [[Dances around the TL, singing.]]
Yeah, I'm a bio whore. I don't care.

Hey Kins.
I better be.
@ErraticFelon [[Laughs softly and raises my hand, letting it inches from your chest.]] Can I?
Of course I did! I didn't want to miss the kiss!

Although I heard the song and /loved/ it.
@ErraticFelon Shouldn't I be? [[Offers you a genuine smile, shrugging my shoulders again.]] Are you?
Shout At The Moon?
Sigh, I agree.
@ErraticFelon You're welcome...[[Takes a deep breath.]] Well then, don't let me bother you. Have fun in your new apartment!
@ErraticFelon Oh...that's good news. [[Looks up at you again, mirroring your smile.]] I'm happy for you.

@ErraticFelon No...[[Slowly shakes my head.]]
@ObscureAmity Am not! [[Folds my arms over my chest, frowning.]]

[[Drapes an arm around @SvelteVehement's shoulders, nodding in understanding.]] Welcome to the "I miss my boyfriend" club. Enjoy your stay.
I'm good, @SvelteVehement. Just missing my boyfriend. [[Shrugs my shoulders.]] And you?
@SvelteVehement Exactly. [[Grins and presses a kiss on your cheek.]]
@SvelteVehement Why do you think I call you Aless all the time?!
@SatanicNeurotic [[Raises a brow.]] How about no?
Aless, your name is long as hell. No wonder Damon got it wrong. [[Chuckles.]]

[[Looks at @SatanicNeurotic suspiciously.]] Wait a minute...you're not a vampire anymore?
[[Laughs and follows @DeceivingVamp up the stairs, before I make my way into my room. I gather some clothes and put then in a bag.]]

@SatanicNeurotic [[Raises a brow at you.]] You'd lose? But you're older than me. I mean, you've been a vampire far longer than I have.
Yes, Dax?
@ErraticFelon Shake the booty! [[Cheers and slaps your bum once gently.]]

@CrazedDamsel I definitely will. Thank you!
@CrazedDamsel Oh really? Okay, I didn't know that.
@CrazedDamsel Won't it be weird as hell? You all are friends, and then..there's me like a potato surrounded by a bunch of fine strawberries.
