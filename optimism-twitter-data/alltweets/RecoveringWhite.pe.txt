All I want is to give in to relapse but I'm going on more than 100 days... I'm trying to make myself stick with it
I am sick of pretending. pretending I'm happier. pretending I don't wake up every day and hate my body, my face, my hair, everything
I don't even know what to do anymore... I feel so hopeless and confused about everything. I hate my weight, my body. School is miserable.
@Skyvie everyone assumes you are somehow faking a disorder to get attention and concessions. It furthers the stigma and makes people hide
@Skyvie ...they won't immediately believe it. Sometimes you just want and need people to see and understand what you feel
@Skyvie I get it- I've been thinking a lot lately about actually telling. Y family. I'm also at a better place now though so I feel like...
@Skyvie want to be selfish or put too much on their shoulders. Please you know you can talk to me... I will always listen and understand
@Skyvie I understand so much of what you're going through- it's hard to talk to any outside friends/family about these things- you don't...
Every time I think I'm grown to accept myself more, something kicks me down again... I'm just feeling pretty worthless right now...
If you meant it as a joke, it wasn't funny... Maybe if you'd have signed it, and you're a friend, but you didn't. Asshole.
To the person who wrote "tankin it up" on my dorm door's whiteboard, thanks for flaring up my insecurities... You're a piece of work.
And it feels so amazing to finally let go. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I gave blood for the first time in a LONG time- I haven't tried for a while due to cuts on my arms, but I don't let those control me anymore
Sorry for being a screw up most of the time. 
Guys I had a sort of relapse yesterday- I mean not completely how I used to harm, but I definitely screwed up a bit. Feeling really low rn
Like I mentioned to a friend that I had to stop at the hospital for a quick blood test but she got so concerned and asked me if I was okay <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
People don't understand how the simplest comment or question can make me feel so much better and cared for
#DearMe just because people can't see your pain, doesn't mean it's not real. Take time to help and love yourself. #selfharmawarenessday
You appreciate the light, the darker your life has been...

45 days and the urge is stronger than ever...
Sooo.. I'm in college. And I hate it. I swear, nothing has ever made me feel as much a failure as I do here at school <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
I don't think there is anything more horrifying than watching a "comedy" movie and having them make jokes about suicide. No. Not okay.
I mean that I used to.... Not at I am right now. I have been trying to tell my friend for a while now and just finally found the right words
I told someone tonight... Not everything, but some... I didn't say I self harmed, but I admitted to suicidal thoughts and anxiety #progress
These destructive thoughts have taken me down once already, I'm not sure I know his to fight them... <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
I mean, it's always been there, in the back of my head, but now I'm stuck in this place where I'm letting myself think about it more
I haven't been on here in a while. But I'm really struggling, guys. I'm not even sure why, but I just really want to let myself cut again...
@DopestNialler awe of course! Sweetie I'm always around if you need cheered up or someone to talk to <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Like it makes me want to run to the gym again... And I was there for two hours earlier in preps of this... I know it won't help, but still <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm not proud of myself... My school does a fancy V-Day dinner and they had a pasta bar so I just ate far too much-one of my problem foods<PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
Four weeks clean since my last relapse- I will stay strong this time. this is for good <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
I know I should feel so much stronger, but does anyone else feel weak in recovery? I just feel so much more vulnerable, not hiding things...
He last one really hit home... I was shaking so bad I had to say I was going to the bathroom, because that is too much for me right now
Like two of my friends were talking about stories of their friends- on who almost hung herself and one who almost slit her wrists...
What are you supposed to say when friends talk about how they can't understand why someone would consider suicide, when you've been there...
You are not a bad person for putting yourself first. If they can't support you at your lowest, they don't deserve you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
So I was able to deal with my anger- the gym helped.... But now, with the darkness coming on, I'm just plain upset about earlier...

@laurencliffxrd I honestly don't know yet- I think I'm more in shock and anger now.... I'm trying not to react too quickly... But thanks <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Like she knew how mentally unstable I am when it comes to food, and she just made my feelings worse. It was totally unprofessional.
My school therapist at I was forced to see just commented on my "unhealthy" choice of food- in what universe is that okay??
"The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely"

Even sometimes the smallest things can bring back old urges.... But I'm still here to fight, to recover, because I deserve it. #fighter <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
And I have enough anxiety to overcome just to workout in front of a few people, so that really set me back... People are hurtful...
I mean if you have a problem about someone a little bigger like me, why laugh at them when they are at the gym trying to fix the problem??
So today at the gym these girls were pointing directly at me and whispering/giggling to themselves. I'm not paranoid- no one else was there
As many of you have been through hell and back, please make sure to tweet #BellLetsTalk so donations can be made on behalf of mental health

@cristalynb if only life wasn't such a mystery to us sometimes... I know how ya feel- you desperately want to understand but know you won't
@FlyingFree34 thank you for all your support and suggestions (:
@FlyingFree34 done but I'm so afraid to make it seem like I want to talk about me but it is much easier to believe someone
@FlyingFree34 I am too. I am trying to show her I really am... I have come so close many times to telling her why I understand and what I've
@FlyingFree34 she was worried tonight because she said she feels like she needs to be in a hospital, because meds aren't working...
@FlyingFree34 whether it her parent(s) or doctor first. At least someone
@FlyingFree34 yeah... She said she was afraid to admit that and worry people but I think I was able to convince her to at least tell someone
@FlyingFree34 and yeah she sees a doctor- she is on. Education which I am so proud of her for doing, because that takes bravery to admit
@FlyingFree34 I've felt that way when people said that so I'm trying to show it as well.
@FlyingFree34 because she admitted things are worse than they've been... I just know sometimes it feels like "I'm here for you" is hollow-
@FlyingFree34 yeah I felt at first I was bothering her because I will reach out and ask how things are but I'm glad I did tonight...
Please read my tweets and help figure out what to do.... I'm sorry I've sent about 6 tweets worth of explaining... Someone give me advice?
My heart is in such pain right now... A (younger) girl I adore admitted to me tonight how strong her feelings of depression and anxiety...
Are and have been for the last year or two... I am trying to be there for her whenever she needs me and check in because I can't let her...
Think that no one is here for her- I want to be there whenever she needs, because I've been there. I almost admitted my own past with SH...
And anxiety and a near suicide attempt but I didn't want to make it about me... But I feel like I'm keeping something from her if I don't...
Admit it to her- any thoughts? I mean I've dropped hints and things about me not being as brave as she and getting help in high school...
So I wonder if she knows... But if she hasn't put it together I don't want her to feel like I kept this from her. Help? Would it be better??
People who have not gone through with a suicidal act do NOT get the credit they deserve- the strength it takes to get up and live? Amazing.
To anyone who has ever sat with pills, or a gun in their hand to die and changed their mind, I want to thank you for choosing life
People tell me I've changed... Well thank f*cking goodness because I hate who I was- I can't believe how I've been treating myself

This is your sign that you shouldn't kill yourself or self-harm.

“@AgainstSuicide: "I used to self harm" is one of the strongest things someone can say.” It may be hard to admit, so I respect those who do
Here's a reminder: if you want to change your body, make sure you're doing it for YOU- your weight, hair, etc isn't anyone else's business
@Recoveryst and so I never considered telling them again. They were the only one I trusted enough to tell
@Recoveryst that is the worst- I'd almost come clean to someone when they mentioned SH but they said people did it for attention...
I don't know about you guys, but this kinda makes me feel better- sometimes you can't trap beauty on a piece of paper 
@Recoveryst so it's no wonder a number of young kids are hiding these issues- we don't give them a reason not to or explanation of why
@Recoveryst definitely- the only mental illness I ever heard in high school was depression- which was highly stereotyped and stigmatized
@staybravealways thank you as well! Never hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything- I'll be here for you <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@Recoveryst hey actually never really knew about my problems but she was more vocal about it so I don't know why they were so rude...
@Recoveryst I have a group of friends that I know another girl has gone through similar issues, yet others still joke about it around us
@Recoveryst it's a shame... Sometimes I wonder if people make those jokes cause they don't realize how it affects us or they just don't care

One of my only 2015 resolutions is officially broken... <PENSIVE FACE>
Sometimes I think about coming clean so I can get help, But I hate the idea of someone psychoanalyst get me again- it hurts to talk about...
Well then.
I'm trying so hard not to reach for my razor right now but it's like I'm falling apart- my heart is beating so fast right now wanting it...
I'll tell you my secrets, you can sharpen your knife...
And that sums up my two distinct habits depending on where I am... What is wrong with me that I can't just stay on track all the time?
I just hope when I go back to school I can stop that again... I'd rather starve myself at school than eat so much at home
Well here I am again... Stuffing myself for no reason at all and purging.... Being home is bringing back so many bad habits...
Getting there: I'm not fully SH clean, but today I threw away my stash of pills I was about to use months ago to end my life #babysteps <RELIEVED FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN>
My family doesn't understand though- they don't even know- and I had to eat something with them as a family without raising questions...

@MrtViolet @SuicideStops thank you so much for your support- I wish I knew more people like you guys!
@SuicideStops thank you so much! I don't have people to support me so it mean so much <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
“@SuicideStops: Quote this with how many days you've been clean!” 20!! Not my longest but I'm going to get there!
I worry that when I go back to school I'm going to try and starve myself again to get rid of this... I just feel worse and worse every day
Not to mention I had surgery so I can't exercise... I can just feel myself gaining all the weight I started to lose. It's just pointless
The most stressful thing about being home from school is the food I'm surrounded by- my mom makes huge dinners and I have to eat them...
“@ProjectBuddy: Things you really need to know 
“@demisbride: oh 
“@losingxhope: A lonely girl.. 
@_stay_strong21 darling I don't know what is happening in your life but please stay strong-Don't do anything you can't take back- talk to me
Sometimes I wonder if anyone I follow or who follows me is a secret account of someone I know... Unlikely, but possible
“@losingxhope: Because sometimes.. 
Like I reach out to people and get nothing- but I shouldn't be surprised- that is how I live my life: alone and depressed. No one to talk to
I originally made this Twitter because I wanted to express myself and have people to rely on. But it's not even worth ot
@SoFragile953 honey you're more beautiful than I can ever hope to be- it's a shame that people don't tell you that more often
Relapse. 
Like I'm ready to stop eating again... Last time I did for a week I lost ten pounds- that is what I need asap.
I really just need to lose weight at this point- I've been trying to just do the healthy gym thing but it doesn't help...
Well hello again, old friend.... Oops
Guys. I'm so stressed and anxious and upset right now, I just keep looking at where I stashed my blade.... The urge is so bad right now
“@demisbride: Sexual orientation: Demi Lovato's smile 
“@losingxhope: "@ISuiciidal: As soon as you.. 
The only thing is I'm not sure if I have... Lately all I keep thinking about is cutting... It's getting harder to resist and fight relapse
So the school counselor cleared me so I don't have to keep talking to her- said she thinks "I've learned how to cope"...
it just feels like the smallest things in my day have me thinking about picking up my blades again.... I've made it so far to relapse again
So I haven't tweeted in a while cause I was doing so well but I'm starting to sink again.... I don't know what to do
The worst thing is when you feel so happy for a minute and the next second you're back in that dark, enveloping depression
My scars are starting to fade, and that is really starting to scare me. They shame me, but they're a part of me. I feel really confused
I hope everyone feels beautiful. If you don't, just find one thing about yourself that is beautiful. It's hard to do, but I know it's there
“@cr0sstheline: Cross the line if you feel guilty about being depressed because nothing bad has ever happened to you.” Every day.
So I kinda dropped off the face of the earth the last week... School has only been going for two days and I'm so overwhelmed
It is sad how true this is. I may not be harming myself, but I definitely struggle to love myself everyday 
People don't know how hard it is to just quit from any addiction. Now that I've been through it I understand with any addiction
Even though I've been clean for more than a month, it was so hard for me today not to relapse again over one of the stupidest things
Hey guys I know some days are harder than the rest but if anyone EVER needs someone to listen I'm here for you- #staystrongsaturday
“@exquisitedamage: “@cxtting_bitch: This. 
Guys I've been clean for three weeks and that is he longest I've been clean in six months and I'm so happy (:
#TruthdayTuesday I have been talking to a therapist for 4 months, but only started because they threatened to take away my school housing
I've got shame, I've got scars that I will never show; I'm a survivor, in more ways than you know
There is rarely ever a "Prince Charming" that will save you- you must learn to save yourself :)
I think I'm really starting to feel like my old happy self... I'm just scared that everything will come crashing down again
Like I am not proud of all my issues- THESE ARE NOT FASHION TRENDS!! Stop making it seem like it adds to your status. not cool
2- when people act like they're better than you because they think having x disorder is better than you and worth boasting about
Two things piss me off. 1- when someone makes a joke about self harm or eating disorders- no! These are serious issues people struggle with
And I want to lose weight, but I'm afraid she'll notice if something is up- I mean I've managed to lie so far but that is taking it farther
I can't wait to go back to school so I won't have to eat dinner with my family, but I'll have to see my therapist again when I go
Anyone know any good diet pills that work?? Afraid to buy something that won't work
@skin_im_in_ let me know when you figure it out
I am counting down the days until I go back to school and get away from this place
“@Cuttingflower: 
I love that my parents say things like "you seem happier"- really? You didn't notice the months and years I've been drowning in pain?
I mean I know I deserve it for hating myself and being so fat... But maybe by starving less people will notice as long as I play it right
Part of me sees starving as a replacement for my SH... At least starving doesn't leave noticeable marks that people can see
My aunt told me at a reunion today that I looked like I was losing weight, but it's not enough- I could lose 50 lbs and still hate myself...
“@why_food: I have an eating disorder... 
I know people say "no one is going to save you but yourself", but if you need anything, I'm here for you- don't give up #StayStrongSaturday
@bestrong4everr red/pink?
@_stay_strong21 hey I don't know you but I understand how much pain you're in, but please don't leave us- we're here if you need to talk!
I want to go to school so I can skip dinner without my parents jumping down my throat with questions or being forced to eat

@slowlyyDead you will not annoy me (: I will do my best to be here for you if you need someone
Sometimes you gotta fall before you can fly...
@slowlyyDead no need to thank me- we all need help sometimes- just promise you'll reach out if you need help (:
@slowlyyDead I'm here if you ever need to talk (:
@slowlyyDead we all make mistakes- please don't be too harsh on yourself- this is my 5th attempt at recovery so I understand how hard it is
I made it through today without relapse- which I was so close to earlier... Baby steps (:
I hate when people call suicide, or self harming "selfish". No. How dare you. Be a little understanding and get off your high horse.
I don't want to be just another social casualty....
Like at home I am forced to sit down and eat dinner with my family- and I'm surrounded by food. At school I just won't buy any
I can't wait to go back to school, because it will be easier to hide my eating habits
“@ProjectBuddy: !!!!!! 
Like everything has been going fine but all it takes is one thing to set me off and now I'm stuck I'm this dark place feeling lost in myself
The worst feeling is when you realize that you've been lying to friends, your psychologist, and yourself, saying that you're fine.

It's a part of me. It's an ugly part but it'…

I got irritated when my sister compared the relief of popping a pimple to "when someone cuts themself." no. This is addiction. Not cosmetic
@AloneAndTrying I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to!
Here's a difficult challenge to everyone- even on those dark days, find at least ONE thing to laugh about :) 
Because I know this will all be worth it in the end- I want to be happy and successful the rest of my life- I want to make a difference
Like the slightest things make me want to let the emptiness pull me back under again.... But I know I need to Stay Strong for good this time
The worst thing about trying to recover is that no one in my family knows... Even of they did they wouldn't understand
Did I hide it that well? Did I used to fool everyone that well that not even my own family questioned my unhappiness? Or did they not care?.
But at the same time, if they think I look a lot happier, why did they never notice how sad I looked in the past?
My aunt told my mom I looked like I lost weight and that I seemed happier... She doesn't understand how much that meant to me
“@FreeAndAbove: Quote this with a lyric that spills out your heart” who I am hates who I've been...
If you need someone to talk to I'm here- you're so much stronger than you feel- I know the emptiness is taking over, but you can beat it!
She is my inspiration and proof that recovery is possible and worth the struggle for a better life. #WarriorWednesday 
Truth day Tuesday: there comes a point when you realize you're the only person that can save yourself... Sometimes it takes time to WANT to

Truth day Tuesday: I've self harmed for the last three years, and this is the 4th time I've tried to stop... Here's to making this time last
“@AgainstSuicide: Youll never know how close someone is from writing a note. From hurting themselves to feel better. From ending everything”
“@SkinnyForFlying: she knows what she´s talking about 
@FreeAndAbove I love writing handwritten letters- no one does anymore!
“@AgainstSuicide: It's scary to think about. 
saw an old family friend today who I haven't seen in two years... He didn't even talk to me and that kinda hurt- we used to be so close :(
@Your_awarrior thank you so much- I promise to do everything I can to stay strong for you and all the others who have offered me support (:
I want to only post lyrics, pictures, quotes, and all else that gives me hope &amp; inspiration. I will NEVER post a SH/ED positive pic- promise
I really don't want to make this a sob story page... But I'm going to treat this as a sort of journal to stay in recovery
I'm eating more than I want... Which leads to periods of starving and purging... And I relapsed through self harm... I don't know what to do
I can't wait until I move back into school in four weeks- I'm around so much food and so much criticism from family....

The worst thing is when i hear/see "ignore the people and their hateful words"... What do you do when those words come from your own mind??
But if i tell people then what will they think... I feel like my problems aren't serious enough- it is all in my head and how i overreact
The hardest part of this is that everyone thinks i have it all together and that I am happy, because I'm too afraid to tell anyone...
Truth. 
The first day after relapse is the hardest because you have to say "yes, I messed up, but I won't let this control me again"
"@I_care_____: I have this 
@WeRNotOurScars Better, thank you... Yesterday was rough but I'm hoping today is better
... I was a month clean but i gave in tonight.... I know I shouldn't let it control me but i was weak- looking for advice on my journey!
Hey guys... I'm making this twitter because I really need some support as I'm trying to stop self harming... This isn't easy as many know...
