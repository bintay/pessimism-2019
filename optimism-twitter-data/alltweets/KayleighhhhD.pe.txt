Yes there is a new princess and yes the prince waving is cute but really dont need to see all their lives

Todays been going so slow...
Soo dont want to be in school today <NEUTRAL FACE>
Second nose bleed of the day...
Tiding my room is boring!

There are some strange kids programmes out there!
Today the little one has a fasination with my eyes, glasses and earrings...
I only have 3 weeks left at school <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><FEARFUL FACE>
I think you were in the wrong for not watching the car infront! If i am indicating to come off trying to cut infront doesnt work! People!
@JessLeighA thats not a good plan... the army is so they learn to protect
@JessLeighA what the fuck? What was said?
2nd round of avengers today :D
Cant do right for doing wrong... hi my name is kayleigh and i appear to be a fuck up
Hy am i such a fuck up?
The realisation of tomorrow from 8:50am i wont be in the house until maybe gone midnight let alone in my bed!
No work to do in frees... bored!
Wanting to show you how much i care, but not letting you see the respect i have for you that you dont have for me...
Why would you camp outside a hospital when shes not even there yet... Kate will have the baby at home at this rate!
Not feeling it this morning... how am i supposed to last until saturday/sunday morning with little sleep?
To awake to go to sleep...

"Dont you ever say i just walked away, i will always want you"
AVENGERS TODAY!!! Not fangirling at all <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

You know what just an explanation would be nice! My head hurts trying to figure out what has changed and what you want!

You know the warmer weather is back when dinners become simular... new potatoes, salad and.... seriously -.-
Dont want to go to my flute lesson!
Love waking up to sunshine 
Literally how i feel! 
You know what dance with my little people makes me soo happy... this is why i want a career with them!
Why do i go and ruin it when someone wants me for me?...I try to sort it but end up losing people! Whats wrong with me?
What hurts most is the confusing! Please nust clear my head up! Seriously i cant deal with it <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Especially when im an overthinker too... all i ask is if your thinking about me... talk to me and no one cause i gave no impression of hurt
There is only so many ways i can say your actions hurt more than your words because i can understand your words... your actions i dont
I dont want to be the one that walks away because you cant see how much i miss smiling and talking to my friend
Asking "have i hurt you" must indicate that you have been thinking about your actions... my head is confised with what you want from me...
I moved on to better things, awkwardness is on you mate! :P
when stalking, you relise actually i got lucky getting out of there pretty quickly, looking at it you maturaity levels do not reach mine
Its the lonelyness that hurts the most... but i put a smile on and hide it from the world...
I just want my friend, my distraction, the side we lost when everythjng got intense and changed...
Biggest fear is another will be invited out when you are back instead of me...
I cant have screwed up that much to lose the friend you became to me... could i?
Is it easier to back to fantasing over my characters that i have left behind for awhile? Need to gain my imagination back
In all of this hurt... im missing the friend i had... just want to go back to that relationship and forget every extra word said...
You know what... heres my life... why dont you bloody have it!
Being the only awake at a friends... and trying to go back to sleep but your too awake :/
Last rant! You dont want to hurt me... well by doing this hurts me more!
If i dont hear anything by tonight  my guard is going up and good luck breaking it this time!
You put barriers up when someone gets attached... shouldnt it be "you put barriers up when you get attached"
But if you dont have the dencenty to do that then it is very easy for me to walk away cause fun isnt ment to make you feel like i do!
Im not just gonna be the girl on the other end of the phone when you want me! I would like to talk as friends as well!
You know what this is ment to be fun for both of us... and at the moment im just getting more pissed off
(2) someone else can now sort out my technical needs when it comes to the show cause your coming nowhere near me!
(1) Treating professionally my arse... well done twat you have now lost all respect from me even in a working enviroment...
I cant apologise enough for what id done but it would be nice for you to acknowledge the fact i know ive done wrong <PENSIVE FACE>
Why does the world feel i can be happy but let it come crashing down so bloody hard! What do i do wrong to deserve this?
"It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not" 
<ANGUISHED FACE><WEARY FACE><WORRIED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
Mother nature hates me <ANGUISHED FACE><HUSHED FACE>

Inner freak showing... Oh dear my room like the one in the left still... Not so bad as before but ummmm :S

Lucy's birthday - Cake made with friends :) good way to spend an evening #lovemygirls
I am an 18 year old who loves to read and couldn't stop myself... #WorldBookDay #ClaryFray #MortalInstruments 
Okay so I thought saying no to the Snapchat would get rid... But your very determined :S ahaa
Hate when people stalk and like my photos on Instagram but I can't see their page unless I follow... Creeps me out!
"Snapchat ya boobs" umm let's try NO... Well at least your forward and honest with what you want... Soo not a keeper!
Okay so today may have gone a little bit weird...
I have such talented friends! @OrigamiBandit modeling for her art 
Looking at my timetable today I technically don't have to be in school until p4 as my business lessons will be full of sitting doing nothing
Smile and let the world wonder why
okay so i may have reached the "you could had this" stage of this! #MissedOut
I get excited over the finest of things :D
Booking insurgent tickets today :D... 16/3 Mockingjay on DVD and then 19/3 Insurgent #GoodWeekRightThere
"You out the milk and cereal in the big fat sheep and then you eat it all up" ahaa
I remember 64 zoolane when I was little!! #ChildHoodReturns
A good friend would acknowledge me when we see each other either with a smile or a nodd if can't say "hello" not just blantley ignore!
New week new start... No more dwelling over you or what is happening... I am done being upset and pissed off time to go back to being me!
Great another sleepless night... Stupid over thinking! Turn off and forget is so hard it actually hurts!
Not gonna give me much confidence with future relationships is it? Cheers for that!
Because they didn't no the extend of my feelings towards you... I went in with no expirence, and I come out hurt and betrayed!
Surrounding myself with people but they can't stop the lonelyness I'm feeling!
Why do I feel like I had done something wrong for it to just end and for you to move on so quickly?
Hmm if I moved on this quickly I would be seen as a slut!
Im not gonna regret what made me happy but I'm not gonna waste anymore tears or time on you... I now have a new confidence!!
"ImGonnaHardenMyHeartSwollowMyTearsImGonnaTurnAndLeaveYouHere" lyrics I will always stick true too!
...I feel betrayed with the news I have gained tonight! Don't me a coward and take the fact you have upset me! And witness it!
I'm surrounding by the people I love and they care for me but I've never felt more alone now...
Although j do love the fact you assume we are going to go straight to friends!
Hmm so I reply to your text but none from you yet your online... I guess another is more important than trying to sort out us!!
Gone the wrong for being friends!!! Cause I'm never gonna be able to trust you again!!
I love the fact that when you say your piece you expect a reply.. But when I say mine you reply on your terms :'(
Just want this head ache to disappear!
Getting more and more confused as I try and think it over
School is not where I want to be... Infact all I wanna do is lie in bed and stop my head from hurting! Hard to keep a smile on...
Who new that 2 weeks of pure joy can result in me feeling like how I am now... Seriously confused on what has happened
#MoreFOUR

Calm atmosphere to start off with... Hoping it will last the night

Why do people feel the need to make others look fab whilst I do all the work with no mention... I guess my rants not over!
#5 rant over....
#4 whereas using my skill kf strenth to support someone over and over again is not (useful but not) its also disheartening on my body shape
3# this core is proved in my A2 dance which is giving me experience in other skills I can gain for uni...
#2 plus my core strength I have enables me to be able to hold myself properly in lifts so the other person doesnt have to do much work...
I know I have strength so can lift people but I am small and cant get the height needed can I please hace a go being seen as a elegant!!
