I could handle one 30 second promo, that I rewatched about 100x, but not anymore than that. lol #notspoilerfree #butnotcompletelyspoiled
So many #Hannibal premiere spoilers. *steps away from Twitter*
#LRT Good to hear. Feeling remorseful about my (tagged) "Fuck you" to all writers. Robbie Thompson loves it and thinks it's honest. Okay. :)
@starminion @tehjessicarae @SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 I can't remember another time I've ever cried like (cont) 
@StarMinion @SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 *hugs to everyone*  We ALL loved Charlie, and still love her...
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 But I definitely know how you feel, and I'm sorry. I wish any of us could do something about this.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 I went through so many ups and downs (rage, depression, hope, desperation) that I now feel so exhausted.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 and crying to every friend/family who asked why looked upset about how awful/unfair Charlie's death had been.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 giving myself a stress headache, then spend the rest of the day trying to save Charlie 
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 I understand. I didn't watch the episode and cried all that night when Twitter broke the news to the point of
But now I don't feel like I'm in some bizarro world where the writers' evil dopplegangers somehow rule supreme and hate everything we love.
I'm still not watching Supernatural, and I still can't imagine being "joyous" about any other show related development (destiel or other...)
The decision came down to Carver and Singer. They killed Charlie.
Before, it just felt like the writers all sort of gave up on Charlie, because I thought decisions like that were voted on by the group.
A lot of my anger is going away knowing that Robbie Thompson fought so hard to save Charlie and was simply shut down.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 But I want to remember our Charlie, and not have her death scene be the last image I see this season.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 through photos and gifsets reblogged by heartless people on Twitter/Tumblr.
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 Yeah, part of the reason I will never watch Dark Dynasty (canon rejected!) even though I've seen her death
@SuchFun_AreWe @rthompson1138 I'll be joining in on that Charlie marathon tomorrow but I know it will be so bitter sweet.
@eponassong Yes, that was what I was imply. Fandom creates expectations/desires that the show can't meet.
@pietoperdition *CRYING*
@celest_gw which I honestly can't imagine. Anyway, I hope Jensen meant Crowley, although for a finale, Crowley dying doesn't seem that major
@celest_gw themselves out of, as in his death would shock or horrify us. Unless the last 2 episodes really give him a solid redemption arc
@celest_gw Yes, but even fans who love Crowley understand he's the villain and I can't imagine an outcry where TPTB would have to dig
That's really one of the downsides of fandom. It creates this incredibly rich and beautiful dimension to SPN that the show itself lacks.
#LRT: The collective power of fandom will always be better than the collective writers room. Far more intelligent, creative, and gutsy.
In which case, next year isn't season 11 it's actually season 7 (2.0).
Unless the aim of season 10 was to strip away the show of everyone but Dean and Sam.
Either way, if they kill Dean, Sam, or Cas. We know they will resurface again in season 11.
Unless Jensen is so out of the fandom loop that he actually believes Crowley is someone that fans would miss. I hope he's that naive.
#LRT: It has to be Cas dying, which would make season 10 officially the season of FUCK. As in: Fuck you, Supernatural. We hate everything.
@FateOfCastiel @rthompson1138 And the intense feeling of impotency resurfaces... *sighs*
This is absolutely wonderful. #MSR  ( full story book here: 
Alaina makes Singer sound like a douchebag. And to think I always gave him the benefit of the doubt when others bashed him. #Asylum14
There was a point where I would be so happy that JDM is coming back, I'd probably have cried. Now? Don't care without Charlie. #Supernatural
@angelthatcould Thank God he said this because there is a quote floating around where Misha asserted that Cas was MALE or felt like a MAN.
@NBCHannibal @OriginalFunko @BryanFuller I'd say the 2 recurring females, would be ideal: Bedelia and Alana. :)
@NBCHannibal @OriginalFunko @BryanFuller I already have Will and Hannibal, so adding Bedelia (FUNKO) would be perfect!
@NBCHannibal Absolutely stunning!
@SmorganStory @rthompson1138 @robertberens Agree with that advice. Whenever I read, I get inspired to write.
@FangasmSPN Any comments on Charlie?
Re: Mulder/Scully: This is so spot on! 
The official X-Files account ---&gt; @thexfilesfox 

Follow them! :)
@_nathy @rthompson1138 @robertberens @AdamGlass44 Imagine my surprise when the exact opposite happened. I'm still in shock... #surreal
@_nathy @rthompson1138 @robertberens @AdamGlass44 My expectations/desires for Charlie were that she'd become a series regular.
@CastieIsAssbutt @rthompson1138 @robertberens @AdamGlass44 It was so spot on, I had to share. There are others just as insightful.
.@rthompson1138 @robertberens @adamglass44 If you can read ONE commentary about Charlie, read: 
(also 3) everyone being angry...I'm like, "Yes, this level of fandom upset pleases me.")
and 2) watching Charlie videos on youtube and just remembering how awesome she is. *SIGHS*  #slowlycoping #stillrageythough
The only thing that has made me feel better is 1) Felicia Day tweeting..it's like, "Oh, yeah, you're alive. Charlie's a character." *RELIEF*
@angel_kist @raelee514 @StarMinion But this is a fictional world. You can always, always come back, even from death IF these writers wanted.
@angel_kist @raelee514 @StarMinion IMO, they burned her body so fans wouldn't ask for her to return. So we'd all get the message. She's GONE
@TheOrlandoJones Are you at Asylum? All this Charlie stuff made me forget. I was actually really excited then. Now I'm just depressed. :\
@TheOrlandoJones @josiebowie I need this shirt!
@mrstserc @RuthieConnell Ruthie is new to the fandom. I doubt she understood the full scale of what was happening with Charlie. JMO.
@mrstserc @RuthieConnell I thanked her for sympathizing with fans NOW that she knows how much we're mourning Charlie.
.@raelee514 Yeah, I want to know WHY they felt the story needed it, and what the story GAINED from it and how that compares to what it LOST.
Thank you for offering your condolences to fans, @RuthieConnell.
Thank you for understanding that fans are mourning and we feel miserable
Robbie didn't want Charlie killed.
Jim M. didn't want Charlie killed.
Can we find out WHO voted FOR killing Charlie?
I want names. #Asylum14
@feliciaday @dougom @alan_tudyk But when/how will the audio book be made available? Same as the book? Or after? :)
@feliciaday @dougom @alan_tudyk YEAAAAAAAH. I need this audio book in my life.

Now I watch it and cry. #MissingCharlie @FeliciaDay
@anqqi_ *sighs* That's exactly how I feel. What happened to Charlie just felt so wrong. I'd give anything to right that wrong...
@AliceEvansGruff Keeping my fingers crossed then! Thanks for replying. :)
Same. Whether it be writers OR fans, if you mention Destiel in connection to Charlie's death, unfollow me. 
MSR v. Hannidelia: How cool are these! :) #ships 
The one I have is THE best thing ever. It even matches my TXF icon. 
But I don't want to think about SPN, at all, even about Destiel. :(
I need a new header. :\
"Shut up, Mulder."
"Sure. Fine. Whatever."

HA! #TheXFiles
Too bad I have to work! :(
Nearly half way done with a 500K Mulder/Scully fanfiction. And now all I want to do is watch some TXF episodes on Netflix in HD.
@AliceEvansGruff I wish there was a way to have the series on another network, or maybe on netflix? Season 2, limited release?
@AliceEvansGruff Terrible news. I was so in love with this series. #Forever :(

(see how that just came out? Yup. Still with the anger). #itjustseepsin 
@AmberDawnGlover Mmm ice cream, yes...
Anger is not healing. It doesn't even feel good...
Everyone knows Charlie died and that I hate Supernatural. 

And I still don't feel better. :\
Raged about Charlie to EVERYONE, my best friend, my girlfriend (for 4 hours, bless her soul), my sister, my brother, MY FUCKING PARENTS.
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @TheJimMichaels @Chico6 I don't know, I'm probably blocked by now and no one is even reading this. #figures...
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @TheJimMichaels @Chico6 A lot of us care about Charlie. Maybe we're not the fans u care about. But we are here.
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @TheJimMichaels @Chico6 had been high, and the take away being that NO ONE cared about Charlie. That's BS.
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @TheJimMichaels @Chico6 I am happy it was a ratings low because I couldn't stand the gloating if the ratings
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @theJimmichaels @chico6 I wish ratings mattered to you and this series low ratings would move you in some way.
!!! RT @redd_vt @TheJimMichaels @feliciaday so she can appear as a flicker for 10 minutes in 1 ep maybe 3 yrs down the road? No thanks.
@vanillabeandean @TheJimMichaels @feliciaday Yeah, if Charlie is changed in any way, then it's not OUR Charlie and I won't be happy. SIGHS.
@JoAnne_Hankey @TheJimMichaels @feliciaday This would be THE most ideal follow-up. But I can't breathe easy based on speculation alone.
@TheJimMichaels @feliciaday She deserves to be alive. I hope her death was a stunt to keep her safe. Anything else, won't be okay. :\
@TheJimMichaels @feliciaday And most who returned came back for 1-2 episodes, and it was never the same. That's not what I want for Charlie.
@TheJimMichaels @feliciaday So, I've heard that before, but in both SPN/TXF I can count in two hands the characters who returned.
@TheJimMichaels @feliciaday And I was part of the original fandom (aka X-Files) who was the first to always say "no one really dies".
@TheJimMichaels @feliciaday Seriously, the mental anguish over this is HIGH.
Just spoil it if she's alive. RT @TheJimMichaels Just remember nobody ever really dies on #supernatural that includes Charlie- @feliciaday
Imagine if Gilda came back and somehow her fairy magic could bring back Charlie? *sighs* #iwish...
Whoever submitted this postcard is hilarious! 
Passenger Let her go lyrics 
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb You gained nothing but making a lot of fans hate this show.
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb Yet you wipe the slate clean with her. Why?
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb No canonically queer characters but her.
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb We have few characters fandom loves. Few female characters.
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb I can't even get beyond how this SL was suggested or approved.
@rthompson1138 @TheJimMichaels @robertberens @Chico6 @AdamGlass44 @andrewdabb Is destroying everyone for Dean/Sam really good storytelling?
@rthompson1138 @thejimmichaels @robertberens @chico6 @adamglass44 @andrewdabb Yeah, I'm still NOT over this. Rage is actually worse today.
@feliciaday We love you, Felicia. Charlie was the best thing to happen to #SPN. She was pure sunshine because of you and @rthompson1138.
LMAO WELL I'M SURE AS HELL NOT
@TheJimMichaels @JensenAckles You all fucked it up so bad...
@butterflydm @TheJimMichaels @JensenAckles I can't imagine why anyone would want to continue with SPN after tonight. Game over.
@butterflydm @TheJimMichaels @JensenAckles Charlie was invaluable to the series and to fans. Losing her for more Sam and Dean manpain???
@fandom_ly @rthompson1138 Same. My head hurts, and I am on doctors orders NOT to get stressed and I am so beyond stressed right now. :\
"RT @rthompson1138 #BringBackCharlie"

No Ghosts!
No Zombies!
No Hallucinations!

Just bring her back. Alive. And Well. 

I HATE EVERYTHING.
And FYI:

Both Bobby Singer AND Jim Michaels told fans "Charlie was off-limits" and would NEVER be killed. This show is so deceitful.
AND YOU KILL HER OFF. WAY TO GO WRITERS. WAY TO …
I'll just spend the rest of the night crying. Don't mention that show to me again.
I hate everyone. And everything. #Supernatural #thatshow #assholes
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @andrewdabb @AdamGlass44 Like, literally. You ARE assholes. Pass on the message to WHOLE team. Done with SPN.
Hey, #Supernatural: You just killed off Charlie. FUCK YOU.
@rthompson1138 @robertberens @andrewdabb @adamglass44 
FYI. 
#SUPERNATURAL
@cw_spn @feliciaday GODDESS
@cw_spn @feliciaday She's so fucking beautiful. Protect Charlie at all costs!
@KathrynLNewton @destieIrh @FunkoPOPvinyl I haven't heard of a Claire doll YET, but I think the one you saw was custom made. :)
@Lyda_Scott Yes, that'd be fine. As long as she lives to return in season 11.
@Lyda_Scott I'm going to be so nervous tonight...
Someone tweet me #CharlieLives if she survives tonight. I won't be watching until tomorrow.
@JerryWanek I'll enjoy it ONLY if Charlie survives. :)
@YorkAshley You realize the entire fandom would die if that happened, right? lol
@Angie_S_G @ccstarburst Same. Although if she had remained on the show, she'd probably be dead. ^____^
I wonder if there are MSR fics with dom/sub undertones. I'd love to read one. Obviously Scully would be the Dom. OBVIOUSLY. =P
@YorkAshley It's one of my favorite pictures of them. The way David's just asleep on her chest. *fans self*
@Angie_S_G @ccstarburst She'd be so perfect!
Claire: I wasn't...?
M: I hea…
@YorkAshley Off topic: Your background photo! Unf! ;-)
@VeinotteValerie @MadMakNY So you're David-obsessed and I'm Gillian-obsessed! We make quite the pair! =P
EVERYTHING IS ICONIC! RT @YorkAshley @jessahmewren yes omg this is so iconic they're so iconic their love is iconic.
@MadMakNY *DEEP SIGH* It's really, really bad. But upside to joining late is you'll have missed most of the fandom drama.
@MadMakNY Hmmm...something about that sounds familiar, but I really don't think so. I'd love to read it though. Have a URL to it?
@YorkAshley I was??? I didn't know that! *hugs*
It's weak, transparent logic. Right up there with "calling out hate is verbal violence" &amp; "if you don't watch SPN my way, I can't respect u"
But to try to make your opinion somehow MORE valid than the opinion of others through these absurd complaints of "rape!" "necrophilia!" ???
Don't ship Destiel? Splendid. Don't want it to be canon? Awesome. It's YOUR opinion. Others will have THEIR opinion.
Literally every anti-Destiel argument that is "popular" is a load of horse shit.
Ah, yes. I was waiting for this kind of post to pop-up with all the Jimmy/Cas discussion lately. 
@YorkAshley You better join me in SCREAMING to high heaven when we get the FIRST LOOK at Gillian's red hair.
@MadMakNY Do you watch #Supernatural? Talk about dark, angsty, and tortured! lol
That's my jam in all fanficion! ;-) RT @MadMakNY But I used to read a lot of darkfic, with angsty, tortured characterizations.
@MadMakNY Leyla was the first (or one of the first) to do non-con. Then it sort of became a thing in our fandom. There was a ton of non-con.
@MadMakNY Making certain taboo "kinks" (ie.  non-con, bestiality, etc) a bit common place among fans.
@MadMakNY Yeah, well not only did TXF kickstart the whole shipping and fanfiction aspect of fandom, but also the "kink" side of it.
@MadMakNY @VeinotteValerie I really doubt that.

(she'd be using you to get to ~Gillian!!!....or is that just me) ;-)
@MadMakNY You'd keep him from derailing the Mulder/Scully relationship, and be there to remind him of his own canon! He tends to forget!
@MadMakNY You can't read non-canon compliant fics? Or just overly romantic, fluffy 'living in marital bliss' type stories?
@MadMakNY (though that fic was probably more MSR than Mulder/Krycek...)
@MadMakNY I'm now recalling one where Krycek forces himself on Mulder as Scully watches...? It was really angsty. Not at all exploitative.
@MadMakNY Tell me the titles, if you remember them, because I definitely read a few noncon Mulder/Krycek fics.
@zoewillowsmama YEEEEEEEES. *lights a cigar*
@MadMakNY I would love to start a GoFundMe page to send you to Canada to join the TXF writers room. ;-)
@MadMakNY So your current fic is the first MODERN fic I've read in...I don't know 12-15 years? (the fic is glorious, by the way!)
@MadMakNY I hadn't read TXF fanfiction since early 2000 with a few exceptions during IWTB, went back and re-read all my favs I could find.
@zoewillowsmama That was just heavenly. I was like, "Wow, stunning..." for the first images, and by the end... "HOT DAMN." *iz deaded* ;-)
@VeinotteValerie @MadMakNY LMAO. Yes, I imagine our ages are showing. Hehe.
@MadMakNY Our fandom was so... OUT THERE. lol #fanfics #sowrong
@MadMakNY The other 1% would include Doggett/Scully (rare), Doggett/Reyes, or Reyes/Scully
@MadMakNY But it's still not my thing. With fanfiction, I'm 99% MSR loyalist.
@MadMakNY Skinner wasn't so old and gross. haha. So I can imagine more fanfiction with him, because he was paired up with a lot of people.
@MadMakNY Probably up until maybe 1-2 years ago, I reacted with "Ewww!!" to most Skinner fanfic, but as you say, I got older and suddenly
@MadMakNY So I remember reading Mulder/ Krycek, and even some Mulder/Skinner fics.
@MadMakNY I never shipped it, but I always knew I was queer so even as a kid, say age 9-12, being exposed to m/m fanfiction fascinated me.
@MadMakNY ALL of it involved Scully in a sexual situation. *covers face* #bluashing
@MadMakNY tentacle!creature fics, there are some things I read back then that I can't admit to today. lol It was just too wrong, you know.
@MadMakNY I read so much fanfiction back then and the crack fics, were...uh, extensive. And while I will openly admit to reading
@MadMakNY I definitely remember centaur fanfic! And I do believe it was Mulder/Krycek. lmao. #goodmemory
*ascends to heaven*


@MadMakNY Not tentacle monsters, per se, but just human/creature fanfic in general.
@MadMakNY Back then it was certainly crack-ish. Although now it's more mainstream. At least in my current fandom (SPN).

Oh my god. I hit play on the "Extended promo" for #Hannibal and had to put stop within 10 seconds. TOO MANY SPOILERS. STOP IT.
.@rthompson138 @robertberens I can't believe #Hannidelia is canon before #Destiel. 
#Hannidelia is the dark horse ship of the #Hannibal fandom. It patiently lurked in the shadows and now it's sailing full force.
Duuuuude. @BryanFuller 

(You know what you did. Go sit in the corner). #heartattack #GApromotion

OH MY GOD!!!!! Why is your premiere date so far away! @NBCHannibal
@JJ9828 *top lips
@JJ9828 There is a screencap right after that which is golden, where their lips actually touch. :D
It's the strangest feeling. Don't know where it's coming from. @rthompson1138 @thejimmichaels @FeliciaDay @chico6 
Something tells me #Supernatural fans are worried about Charlie. @rthompson1138 @thejimmichaels @FeliciaDay @chico6 
"Wayward Daughters Academy" would make such a fantastic spin-off. #Supernatural @CW_SPN @chico6 @thejimmichaels @robertberens @rthompson1138
The idea that someone doesn't deserve "respect" because they watch a television show for their own reasons is such utter bullshit. #WBros
@eviljunglechick @JJ9828 @tehjessicarae @exorcisingemily Yes, their consistency in being dishonest is worth noting.
How did these tweets get my friend @JJ9828 blocked by WinchesterBros? Is being truthful problematic now? 
@anqqi_ It's so sweet and infectious. &lt;3
#LRT: Gillian doesn't just have a "nice" laugh. She has the most adorable laugh ever. Can anyone show me another laugh that's sweeter? :)

fans: he's bi

wait why is he leaving
@taymelord Well, of course it's fake. Doesn't mean Hannidelia isn't still happening. lol
@Starbuck_Scully @LaurenK611 @Quanticofbi I also found this very helpful when I had mine, which stopped last year: 
@Starbuck_Scully @LaurenK611 @Quanticofbi For instance: 
@Quanticofbi @Starbuck_Scully @LaurenK611 Definitely keep trying, but also make sure you understand the underlying causes and treat them.
@cuteHiddlesmile Stop having a polite conversation? Alright. I'm sorry you're so insecure that you feel threatened by polite discourse.
Hannibal: You're optimist I won't kill you.
Bedelia: Not entirely.

This exchange is so meta. I feel @BryanFuller is talking straight to us.
@taymelord (whispers) it's already happening! *replays S3 promo repeatedly*
Stand by me {HANNIGRAM} [HANNIBAL] 
@JJ9828 I never cared much for them myself. Except in smutty fiction. lol
@cuteHiddlesmile Through my many binge viewings of S1/S2, I grew to love all the characters. So, I'm happy to see everyone's SL unfold. :)
@cuteHiddlesmile I don't understand the Bedelia hate, though. She's not as horrible as Hannibal is, who is literally THE devil on the show.
"@cuteHiddlesmile They were lying to each other." That's true of EVERY Hannibal ship, though. lol Hannibal is the most deceitful character.
@cuteHiddlesmile IDK. I'm just really excited. As a Will/Hannibal fan, I enjoyed their storyline MORE in (cont) 
@cuteHiddlesmile Bedelia is now playing Hannibal, the way Will played him last season. Leading him on. Playing the part. Identical, really.
@cuteHiddlesmile Will does so through his empathy. Bedelia through her intellect. And now they both have seen his good and bad side.
@cuteHiddlesmile Will understands Hannibal and Bedelia understands Hannibal. They simply have a different way of doing so.
@cuteHiddlesmile (the only exception would be: Hannibal/Alana. Ironically THE only truly consensual ship, though he was lying to her).
@cuteHiddlesmile I ship ALL Hannibal ships so far (books/show) and they are all dub-con at best, but more honestly: non-consensual.
@cuteHiddlesmile What I love about Hannibal is how he can corrupt/change people. He does the same with Clarice, his endgame in the books.
@cuteHiddlesmile Will couldn't stand to be with Hannibal either. He violated him to his very core, and yet Will remained.
#LRT: OMG. How fucking LONG is that kiss? And that's only half of it. They start in the hallway, then Gillian shoves David against the wall!
<HEAVY BLACK HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
@cuteHiddlesmile While he can't have Clarice, he's using Bedelia to cover her part of the story.
@cuteHiddlesmile I'm still waiting for Clarice. IMO, Bedelia's life depends more on her, since Fuller has wanted to bring Clarice since S1.
@cuteHiddlesmile But I know she's not everyone's cup of tea. And I don't expect her to live. Her making it to S4 would be a fantasy.
@cuteHiddlesmile I love Bedelia. She's very similar to Hannibal. I consider her a mirror of his in many ways, and often a foil, too.
@cuteHiddlesmile But in the meantime, the ship will sail! :D
@cuteHiddlesmile  I ever expected for the show. I'm sure Bedelia will die. I've been expecting that since season 1. lol
@cuteHiddlesmile Couldn't disagree more. I am a #Hannidelia shipper, and I'm over the moon right now. The premiere is giving me MORE than
All because our ship is same-sex.
This is the difference between slash shippers &amp; het shippers. Slash shippers automatically labeled as "deviants, sex-obsessed, crazy" fans.
Of course, no one THEN or NOW, would ever label Mulder/Shippers are "only caring about sex" EVEN as they demand sex. On the show.
Even now with the revival of the series, I've been seeing fans NEW and OLD, asking about a Mulder/Scully sex scene.
On the other hand, Mulder/Scully shippers in the 90s, THAT fandom was VERY obsessed with sex, and wanting sex scenes on the show.
Irony: Destiel shippers get labeled by anti-shippers as "only caring about sex" but I've never seen that demand for "sex on the show." EVER.
A lot of them are better than the manips you see floating around now. And we have programs like photoshop. lol #notsurehowthathappened
What I love about 90s fandom was how GOOD a lot of things were. Smutty fanfiction aside, all those R-rated manips? Pretty damn good.
I wish I was kidding about that.... #ihadaweirdchildhood #xfiles #fanfiction
#LRT: Is now the time to admit to all those stories I read about Scully being probed by an alien tentacle creature as a kid? ;-)
Remember that one episode where Scully was being seduced by a serial killer? Yeah, me too. #NotHannibal #TheOtherOne #LOL #Milagro
I really need Gillian, David, and Mads to all be photographed together at any event. For reasons. #Hannibal #XFiles #Triangles #Crossover?
I am so jealous of you. I cannot stand it. @EricIGN
@StarMinion @emmyloo03 @JJ9828 My worry is that things change. Let's hope I'm wrong.
@StarMinion @emmyloo03 @JJ9828 Michaels and Singer, I believe said so, I also don't recall Carver. But was that during S9 or S10? #Charlie
@anqqi_ @margarita2083 Thanks for that tip!
My favorite moment from #Supernatural S10 on my header now! 
(What do you mean that wasn't EXACTLY how it happened??)
Thank you to @bilrac!
Now off to bed. Hopefully tomorrow I can say I was wrong and overreacted and not rage quit this show for the umpteenth time.
Didn't think anything could ruin my #Hannibal squee with that promo.
Enter: #Supernatural. 

Thank you, show. I can always count on you. :(
@StarMinion Read a meta that outlined all these "signs/hints" &amp; I'm afraid they may do it. I'm already preparing myself..with rage. *sighs*
Charlie &amp; Dean || King &amp; Lionheart 
#LRT: That's fucking lame, in fact, and characters returning after death is always so anti-climatic, temporary, and contradictory.
"Death isn't always a goodbye." UGH. That is not good enough.
@AmberDawnGlover From SPN: 
@raelee514 @rthompson1138 Well I thought it was funny that the fit would be for not writing her death, not her, you know, DYING in general.
No more characters dying for manpain. It's getting so old.
I can actually see myself hating Dean, Sam, and/or Cas if any of their actions lead to Charlie's death. I will be so fucking angry. UGHHH.

Dear destiel fandom: Stop giving me unreasonably high expectations for the SPN finale, such as: Dean/Cas bodyswap/bodymerge. Just...stop! :)
@feliciaday *gasps* Why??? I love broccoli! *steals yours* *replaces it with apple pie*
@tehjessicarae No problem! I really adore mine. :)
@tehjessicarae Pro-Tip: If you buy the 9 in doll, remove the whiskers. They make the plushie look so much better. 
@tehjessicarae I got my plushie today! It's adorable! &lt;3
@Destiheller If you have the time, DM me the full story. You can leave out names. ;-)
You can tweet hateful things. But if you speak against this hate speech, you're accused of inciting "verbal violence." What a load of crap!
Vitriolic V &amp; Bald-Faced Liar B. My NoTP.
@angel_kist Clearly NOT a neutral party if they have followed the same pattern as the other biased mods.
@angel_kist Who are the four? I was told last year there were three. I wonder which admin got added.
@bilrac Could you tweet me the jpeg of your header? Really love it and wanted to use it. :)
@angel_kist They said as much in their locked accounts and later even publicly. To cover it up with "We were away" is a lie. Simple as that.
@angel_kist The intention to cover Misha's PCA win was never there. All admins were angry that Misha won, J2 didn't.
@angel_kist Oops. Wanted to untag Robbie. But anyway, what I was saying is that she is such an enabler of hate.
@RosieTRiveter She's not a good representative for fandom, and it's a pity this panel couldn't have reached out to be a better person.
@RosieTRiveter @Destiheller she doesn't have the ability to be honest with people or hold herself accountable for her online behavior.
@RosieTRiveter @Destiheller Oh, well. So it's as good as done. I wasn't that upset about her joining until the WFB debacle which told me
This statement is 100% false. You have biased, hateful mods. RT @WinchesterBros @cw_spn @rthompson1138 Our site is 100% neutral.
When someone RT's you and then you catch a typo. :D
@angel_kist @rthompson1138 Especially considering they stated it hadn't been added due to a mod being away. They returned, still nothing.
@RosieTRiveter @Destiheller When is that panel?
@Destiheller Is this true? Do you have a link to the source? I'd love to know the full story because this is hysterical. :D
@margarita2083 She was a guest star for S1 and S2. But now confirmed S3 series regular.
You know, Robbie's quote: But now you need some rest" is making me think that maybe Dean will leave Sam and Cas in the finale.
@YorkAshley I've done that with friends! My girlfriend right now hasn't heard too much about TXF but once it airs, I know I'll annoy her! =P
@margarita2083 I'm not 100% sure I'll even be able to watch all of S3 as my nerves have been pretty bad lately. Crossing my fingers I can!
Literally the ONE flaw of Hannibal: It's so fuckin' graphic. But it's so fuckin' good too. RT @margarita2083  I tried but its so bloody
@raelee514 @t1gerlilly54321 @rthompson1138 Yep, that was another one of my absolute favorites in S9!
@YorkAshley @davidduchovny @GillianA I want so much TXF promotion. Photoshoots, interviews, everything. PLEASE.
You can stop being perfect any time, M&amp;S.
How are my babies that perfect when it's only 1x04, though? Mulder all dirty and raggedy. Scully all sassy and cute. adfghgfdsdfghjhgfdsfghj
#LastRT: What makes that gif all the more adorable is when you remember she's literally laughing @ him. "I have a life." LMAO. No, Mulder.
@t1gerlilly54321 @raelee514 @rthompson1138 Which episodes did he write this season? I know I loved "Heaven Can't Wait" from S9.
Unless you decide Bedelia = Clarice, @BryanFuller. Which, by the way, I'm 100% for. I'm for Clarice in any capacity. lol
Clarice Starling. :D

(I have to mention her once in a while). Psst... @BryanFuller. Still waiting. ;-)
@Synergy3k @HannibalRoom @GillianA @theofficialmads Same. I've watched this promo so many times I've lost all semblance of reality. =P
@CdnRoswell AHHHHHHH!!!!
(as you can tell: still not done replaying that video. I'll be here all night)
Can we talk about Mads Mikkelsen in the first 2 seconds of that promo?

 HOT DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@jessahmewren ROTLMAO. #true
Thank god we know GA is a series regular. Otherwise I'd be worried Bedelia bites the dust in the premiere. :D
I'm just saying. We'll be in heaven for half the episode, then: BLOODSHED.
Just don't forget pretty much EVERY major character was left stabbed or bleeding to death in the finale. LMAO.
The Hannibal promo is completely setting us up to go into the premiere feeling pretty happy and optimistic.
My grumpy cat arrived today. Extremely happy with it. :) #plushie #AngelHeart
@StarMinion @andrewdabb My heart is saying: Tune in! It's Charlie. But my brain is saying: Meh. Skip it. #conflicted
Will probably watch the last 3 eps. Not sure who wrote this week's, but last two are by @AndrewDabb and Carver, right? #YeahLoveThemBoth
Pretty much tuned in 100% for all @rthompson1138 episodes and about 10% for the rest of #Supernatural. I'm a really strange fan. :D
@emmyloo03 @JasonFischer77 I'm just reeling from the S3 Hannibal promo, then I get this. My blood pressure has spiked. @rthompson1138 #quote

What a lovely month for @GillianA fans: @NBCHannibal promo, @TheFallTV season 3 confirmation, and #TXF scheduling news (for June 8th). :D
#LRT: So we're getting a third season of #TheFall after all? Wow.
(okay, so I hated the S2 finale, but I decided I do want more!) #lol
that Hannibal trailer what a great thing to wake up to love my life 
 all I have to say is gillian anderso…
Are there really people out there NOT watching Hannibal? #whydoyouhateyourself
Multi-shipper problems in the #Hannibal fandom? None. Zero. Zip.

100% satisfied on all levels. 

*happy sigh*
Going through my TL. Every time I see the @NBCHannibal promo, I stop and press play. Watched it 12x now and not stopping! =P
X-Files // Quotes redux 
"Utterly sublime" indeed... #Hannibal #Season3 
LMAO..this was me back in December 
#Hannigram just seriously took a backseat to #Hannidelia with one promo. lol  Let's celebrate with some videos: 
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE. 
@NBCHannibal @BryanFuller Which is a wonderful, wonderful thing. :D
Bravo to @NBCHannibal for already exceeding my expectations with a single 30 second promo. Also, @BryanFuller might love GA more than me! =P
I want this in my life. I need this in my life. *collapses* #Hannibal
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! That Hannibal promo looks like PURE fanfiction!!!!

@GadgetGirlMY @rickyisgoat Yeah, I don't think that was a very smart or kind move. I'm sure many people missed out on it.
@JJ9828 DM
@eviljunglechick @365Wyrms @Destiheller @Hollidayo LMAO. Yeah, I know all too well about that. Believe me.
Oh, my god, tumblr. How dare you?? #needtopunchsomeoneintheface #toocute 
Supporting characters they like: Meg, Hannah, every female character Dean has dated or looked at. Hmm. Wonder what they all have in common?
Joffreys: Get everything they want. Still transparently hateful about all things NOT Dean and Sam. Shows how rotten to the core they are.
@talalona A+ policy!
@365Wyrms @Destiheller @Hollidayo Emily's had nothing to do with an specific person and was in fact a web quote taken out of context.
@365Wyrms @Destiheller @Hollidayo It's only reasonable considering that was a direct mention towards a very specific act of violence while
@Destiheller @castiheller The only canon they care about is their own. Not SPN's.
@Destiheller @castiheller I forgot they do those episode podcast. Hope RT listens to hear how vile they are of anyone that isn't SalmonDean.
@Destiheller Cliff-notes version of his new drama with them? Have them blocked and don't want to unblock. #WincestBros
@castiheller @tehjessicarae @Sloth_Exits @Destiheller @meghaner WTH? Now that is indeed psychotic.
@Destiheller Does Holly follow you? Otherwise she can't see this. (also: That's disgusting)
@GadgetGirlMY @rickyisgoat That was from a 4 minute web video online. That was "part 2". A short clip. Not an entire new episode.
@GadgetGirlMY @rickyisgoat Rather, Cornell with the help of Natalie trying to get Ben out of jail, but S2 doesn't have a greenlight yet.
@GadgetGirlMY @rickyisgoat There's also a 4 minute webvideo follow-up that implies if there is a season 2, it just won't be Cornell.
@GadgetGirlMY @rickyisgoat Where are you getting that there is another episode after this? It was promoted as the series finale.
@robertberens @Nicky36 Funner sounds strange to me, but funnest doesn't. *shrugs*
And Mulder and Scully were the first otp I ever shipped <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@rthompson1138 oh my god, that is the best thing ever! and now every wants pizza. nice going, robbie!
@VeinotteValerie Awesome. I have it on my Kindle now. Thank you! :)
@VeinotteValerie Meaning mostly genre-wise. Is it a case fic? romcom? hurt/comfort? etc
@VeinotteValerie Hey, can you give me a little more information about what kind of a fic this is? The summary is a bit vague. :)
@VeinotteValerie @MadMakNY I'd say that's "sufficient" no matter what. =P
@VeinotteValerie @MadMakNY HOLY CRAP! Though I usually don't like WIPs since so many are left incomplete, but this one is over 500k.
@VeinotteValerie @MadMakNY I don't think so, but I was literally just going to log off and read a few hours. :D You have a link?
But I just sent this one to my Kindle, because it sounds awesome. Thanks, sis!
Then I stumbled on this Hannigram/Destiel crossover fic and realized it was my sister's bookmark. Because I never read crossover fics! =P
this until right now. But everyday this week I've been going thru my bookmarks finding GREAT fics, thinking, "When did I bookmark this?" --
Send her a direct link to all the D/C fics and told her to bookmark the ones she liked. And I hadn't realized she actually started doing --
So, I gave my sister my AO3 username/password so she could find/save fics after I bought her a Kindle reader to read Destiel fics --
the anti-anti-destiel blog on tumblr is hilarious.
@deancasbb What's the most authors you've had in a DCBB?
@raelee514 None whatsoever!
@exorcisingemily Another pithy tweet I could have used in a previous convo with a troll! Took me 10 minutes to make this point!
@emmyloo03 I used a dozen tweets to make this one point. If you'd tweeted this sooner, I'd have saved myself the trouble and C/P'ed this! =P
@eviljunglechick Ya think? I swear, no one thinks LESS of Sam than these rabid Sam stans. "He's wallpaper!" "He's erased!" "He has no POV!"
@robertberens lmao. you dork.
@eviljunglechick Ironically, they accuse Cas of being the third wheel, but they are the ones constantly pigeonholing Sam into everything.
@eviljunglechick They are completely obsessed with Sam always coming before Castiel even in a context where discussing Sam is off topic.
@eviljunglechick Sam had an amazing moment with Claire when he opened up about his mother, and never meeting her. Do they care? Nope!
@eviljunglechick Dean's conversation with Claire in 10x20 had NOTHING to do with Sam. It was about Jimmy and Castiel's contributions.
@eviljunglechick They were trying so hard to be a smart ass on really bad logic. Ultimately, what they don't understand is context.
"We always have been."
#TFWSavedTh…
Once again I make my point and the trolls block me! Goodbye @bloodysam1. Hope introducing LOGIC into our conversation didn't scare you away!
LMAO. Putting the world in peril from Lucifer was a "TFW" effort. Saving the world, however, was only a Sam effort. Actual tweets to me! RME
@bloodysam1 If you expected Dean to talk to Claire about "Sam's sacrifices" and jumping into the pit, then YOUR logic is flawed. That's OT!
@bloodysam1 Sam was 100% irrelevant to that conversation, because Dean wanted Claire to know how Jimmy's sacrifice mattered.
@bloodysam1 My logic is that the scene in 10x20 was about Dean informing Claire about Cas/Jimmy's role in "saving people, hunting things."
@tehjessicarae That one moment where Sammeh jumped in the pit happened in isolation. The rest of the season wasn't important!
@bloodysam1 that point in the story. Your narrowmindness is preventing you from seeing the whole picture. You're at Samnatural.
@bloodysam1 LOL. No, it didn't. Life isn't about one moment. Without Dean, Cas, and a lot of other people Sam would have NEVER gotten to
@bloodysam1 Dean focused on what Cas/Jimmy has been able to do, and that is in fact save the world. Sam's own heroism doesn't erase Cas's.
@bloodysam1 That is your problem. You make things a competition. 10x20 scene had NOTHING to do with Sam. It was about Dean/Claire/Cas/Jimmy.
@bloodysam1 Actually, it's called a narrative. A climax doesn't happen on it's own without other elements in place. Here? Team Free Will.
@bloodysam1 You proved my point. When it comes to blame, it's a team effort. When it comes to who gets gratitude, it can only be Sam.
@bloodysam1 Without them, none of these "saving the world" post-season 4 would have been possible.
@bloodysam1 Moreover, "save the world" isn't exclusive to Swan Song. Cas for instance, saved BOTH Dean and Sam from hell.
@bloodysam1 Sam let Lucifer out of the cage. Sam locked Lucifer back in the cage. He wasn't alone in season 5 getting from point A to B.
@bloodysam1 It makes sense if you watch Supernatural and NOT Samnatural. The world wasn't saved in one moment.
@lucasfrere1 Why can't two hashtags exist? You're the one being toxic by using a peaceful hashtag to hate.
@lucasfrere1 @CastieIsAssbutt The people using Destiel images aren't the problem here, buddy. You are.
@lucasfrere1 @CastieIsAssbutt There are posts with ONLY Sam. How pathetic do you have to be to go into an inclusive tag to hate.
@lucasfrere1 So what if there is a Destiel post without Sam? There are also posts with Sam only and not Dean or Cas? Haters gonna hate, huh?
@tehjessicarae lol
@zoewillowsmama Plus, it gave us a really fantastic Dean/Cas scene. I hope for at least one powerful scene for them this finale.
@zoewillowsmama Exactly. It had everything working for it as you say, and of course, the story itself was very dramatic too.
Let me just say, absolute savagery went into the brutal death of Freddie Gray. Hope these murders ARE in fact brought to justice.
"Mosby said that Gray’s death was ruled a homicide and that officers denied Gray medical assistance despite his requests" * SAD SIGH*
@zoewillowsmama The S8 finale was so fantastic though.
@zoewillowsmama I hope for once the finale delivers! Last season was anticlimactic as a lot of fans had already figured out the demon-twist!
@zoewillowsmama What do you think of Sam usurping the role of Dean(/Cain), and him being the one to possibly kill Crowley and Cas?
@zoewillowsmama I've wanted this last season so I'd totally welcome that happening this year. :)
Just a quick FYI: I will be both ~following some new accounts, and ~unfollowing some current accounts. What (cont) 
@zoewillowsmama Oh, my goodness. This is a fantastic theory. Who do you you think will kill who? Dean kills Cas? Or Cas kills Dean?
I swear, certain Sam fans spend MORE time trying to prove EVERYONE hates Sam than they spend actually celebrating and loving Sam themselves.
"Hey, guys! Tomorrow's Sam's birthday, why don't we ruin it with more 10x20 wank? I didn't even watch the episode, but I am so offended!" ~K
@JJ9828 @angel_kist @tehjessicarae @IrinaColberg And only about 200+ tweets total. This new tag already has 600+ with no tumblr promotion.
Which ship is more Dean/Castiel? Buffy/Angel or Buffy/Spike.
I need to know. For science. (aka my girlfriend)
Should I create a tumblr post about this? Should I?
#TFWSavedTheWorld: Dean, Sam and Castiel are ALL heroes. If you exclude one among "who saved the world" you're ignoring #Supernatural canon.
That awkward moment when you start watching #Bangel videos on youtube and end up watching #Spuffy videos as well. #whynotboth
Adorable! 
Where is WFB or WBs and their articles on fandom bullying when you need them? Predictably, this hate gets ignored. 

1. it's in the hole ! it's in the hole!!!1
#LRT: So my random photos got ages 21, 22, and 24. lol 
Um, close enough. :D Then I tried the boyfriends... 
@KathrynLNewton I hope Robbie sees that! So funny!
@GreensieBeans DM
But, I'm just a Cas fans. What do I know? I'm sure the TrueFans have it all figured out. They are always right. ;-)
It's almost like the opposite is true, like Sam fans have been the ones who feel threatened and overshadowed because of Castiel's presence.
I mean, gosh, it's almost -- ALMOST -- as though this myth about Cas fans hating Sam and being insecure because of Sam is wrong.
You know another thing I've never in fandom? Castiel fans lashing out at the writers because of "Dean/Sam broments."
You know one thing I've never seen in fandom? Castiel fans storming the writers feeds demanding that Sam be held accountable for x, y, z.
@Sloth_Exits @SuperWiki We'll have to agree to disagree.
@Sloth_Exits @SuperWiki Ultimately, this isn't a conversation I care to engage in. I'm 100% comfortable in my opinion, and it won't change.
@Sloth_Exits @SuperWiki None of that changes the fact that it's still fiction. And our thoughts and fantasies aren't for anyone to police.
@rthompson1138 @HotTopic Poncho Guy Ponchos would be the best. Would you say we need them for the end of S10 or the end of S11. #justkidding

Now where are my Mr. Fizzles Sock Puppets &amp; Poncho Guy Ponchos!?

#Supernatural #HotTopical htt…
@raelee514 Yup. But now they literally showed you a freaking visual of Jimmy Novak away from Castiel's body. lol
"And if former staff writer/ Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan wants to come back and consult? That’s just fine by us." PLEASE. PLEASE.
One paragraph into that article, "Now this person is a fan of the series." All my complaints written out perfectly. lol #XFiles #MSR #IWTB
#LRT: 
Though perhaps had these awesome ladies been introduced too early on they'd all be dead. Heh. Heh. Fuck, am I jinxing this now???
[SINGS:] "WE COULD OF HAD IT ALL....." #supernatural
SPN's biggest possible tragedies:
1. Destiel never becoming canon
2. Charlie/Claire/Kristy/Jody/Donna being introduced so late in the game.
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 And I'm blocked now! What did me in? My well reason argument, or bringing up Castiel? lol
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 preferred character? Because if so, Castiel is a series regular now. Please tell me how much you love him. :)
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 You aren't trying to imply that simply because a character is a "main character" they need to be someone's
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 What does that have to do with my tweets to Robbie and my personal preferences?
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 Sam/Jess reuniting heaven is a new headcanon of mine, though, now talking about Sam. #JimmyAmelia #SamJess #DnC
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138  Dean/Sam, Sam/everyone, Jody, Donna, et all. Just that at the VERY top of my list, are what I tweeted. ;-)
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 relationships/dynamics, which are Dean/Cas, Charlie/everyone and Claire/everyone. Not to say I don't like/enjoy
@JAREDXJENSEN @rthompson1138 Well, you see, this is my twitter page, and I was tweeting about my personal preferences in terms of
Also goes to show SPN can take their head out of their subtext when they want to (I have no idea what this means, but we all know it's true)
It is a bit ridiculous how much they hit us over the head with the fact that Castiel's body is his now. It was J. Klein levels of obvious.
You have to be a real tool now to use the whole "Destiel can't happen bc of Jimmy." You will be directly ignoring canon: Jimmy is in heaven.
I just bought a plush Grumpy Cat off eBay thanks to @rthompson1138's #AngelHeart episode. IT WAS AWFUL. =P 
I just want Cas to end up with a pet okay. Just one. Cat, preferably, but I'm flexible. Guinea Pig. Bird. Bunny @rthompson1138 @robertberens
So continues the Cas + cat saga! :D
I was so excited about Cas buying a grumpy cat doll just for the meme itself and totally forgot Grumpy cat is, well, a cat!
I've always wanted for someone to kill themselves as a sacrifice. Like maybe Dean is going off the deep end, (cont) 
Initial fan spec: Dean kills Cas. 
New fan spec: Sam kills Cas. 

Which will be true? Dun. Dun. Dun.
So, any bets on who is dying in the finale of #Supernatural? And who will be doing the killing?
@celest_gw They're just so over the top:

Normal people: Writers sure love Cas!
These people: Writers love Cas and hate Sam!! Fire them!!
@__lucindaa @rthompson1138 "Pissy babies against Sam erasure" does have a ring to it. :D
Yup. For the writers Cas is the real hero. Robbie finally revealed the truth.

I just... *facepalm.gif*
rotlmao... 
lol are these people for real? I am reading all these as completely satirical... 
@celest_gw @AdamGlass44 Her and Charlie are my favs! Really miss her.
I will take them all at this point: Charlie, Krissy, Claire, Jody, Donna. Sprinkle them all around. @adamglass44 @rthompson1138 #season11
Am I the only one who misses @AdamGlass44's Krissy Chambers? I want her back for season 11. Bring back more awesome female characters! #SPN
Previously, they've bashed Charlie, and consistently they have bashed Castiel throughout the years.
Just tweeting that preemptively because I'm waiting for BNF's sites who pretend to speak for the "majority" of fans to bash Claire.
Castiel, Charlie, and Claire are fan favorites. They are popular and well-loved. You may disagree, but you ARE in the minority #Supernatural
@robertberens I listened to it anyway, but yeah, got it. ;-)
Bless this 
@SuperWiki Though, just personally "Ewww" to #Clean. *scrubs image from brain*
@SuperWiki ITA. Fiction is fiction for a reason. I don't GAF if it's an unpopular opinion, but I totally agree with your tweets on ships.
@tehjessicarae Not only is the hate continuing, it's on hyper-drive 
@BruceCampanaro @rthompson1138 Together, they've saved the world. And individually those contributions should be recognized more often.
@BruceCampanaro @rthompson1138 In retrospect, it also goes really well with what is being repeated over and over: They're stronger together.
@BruceCampanaro @rthompson1138 Good point. It certainly helped make the growth between Claire/Cas (even Dean/Claire) much more believable.
OH MY FUCKING GOD. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ALL MONTH LONG! YEEEEEAHHH! #REDHAIR  RT @Quanticofbi @FuckUUFknFucker Scuuuulllllllly!!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Tumblr, you sassy fuckers. #Supernatural #WinchesterWednesdays 
I also kept thinking toward the end of the episode, "The angel heart is people!" @rthompson1138 #soylentgreen #kindofgrossthatangelseatsouls
Nephilim supporters: Party of 1. lol
@watch_the_bees @DanglingThpider They're free to think that, but they are ignoring the part where Dean had to travel to Sam's heaven. :)
Grigori &amp; Nephilim connection via 
claire novak was in 3/23
could you pls stop crying
Confirmed: Dean and Sam are definitely NOT soulmates. #Supernatural 
Not that very many people thought it would become canon, but some people did think that, and I just don't see it. *shrugs*
Unpopular opinion: #AngelHeart solidified that there is no way Destiel becomes canon this season. The romantic chemistry is just not there.
@BlantonBaby @KathrynLNewton @cw_spn @JensenAckles Yeah, but she's a teen so I'm glad she ended up giving the gun back.
@KathrynLNewton @InchiRein I think you need to tweet something like 200 tweets in a short period of time (say 1 hour) to go to Twitter jail.
One of my favorite parts. You two have such natural chemistry. RT @KathrynLNewton Dean and Claire finally bonding :)  #Supernatural
@iMelamoryBlim @rthompson1138 Though I guarantee you wouldn't be this rude about it and blame him for "ruining" the show. ;-)
@iMelamoryBlim @rthompson1138 Jensen changed the line of the script. Maybe you should tweet that to Jensen Ackles.
@rthompson1138 oops, more Claire/everyone, too. ;-)
@rthompson1138 You wrote every single favorite episode of mine this season, so thank you! Next year: More Dean/Cas, more Charlie/everyone.
.@NicePeachFuzz @JoAnne_Hankey @rthompson1138 

What Castiel has canonically saved:
<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Dean Winchester
<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Sam Winchester
<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> THE WORLD

@KathrynLNewton @rthompson1138 @JensenAckles Correction: You are BOTH rainbows. :) #DeanxClaire #RobbiexClaire
@itskaylayay @HotTopic Yeah, can you all please make something with Grumpy Cat + Cas + Claire? lol I'd buy that so fast!
@HotTopic @rthompson1138 "I got it at the Hot Topical." was such a Castiel line. I laughed so hard. And what a perfect gift: Grumpy Cat! :)
But you made Cas's contributions valuable. You know that's unacceptable. :D #sarcasm #howdareyou RT @rthompson1138 but still works #CalmDown
@rthompson1138  I found Dean telling Claire that Jimmy was a hero and Cas was able to help save the world very soothing. Thank you for that!
And that last Hannibal spoiler surprise NO ONE. Though I know last year made people hope the show would go against canon and redeem Freddie.

@tehjessicarae @robertberens Homophobic tweets about what?
@tehjessicarae So, yeah, the double standard is blatant.
@tehjessicarae Tincity is literally like, "This is THE greatest thing ever" whereas they were calling Misha out for "sexual harassment".
@MrPhill96 @thatxfilesgirl Vulnerable?  You mean unhappily apart? Or just single without a "partner" providing emotional support at home?
Being a multi-shipper can be so conflicting. #Hannibal #ships
I just want some #Hannidelia fluff, alright? Outside of Will Graham, but I guess the love is too strong in that one to ever go away.
Pretty sure I ship #Hannigram MORE than #Hannidelia, but it still hurt to read something about Hannibal missing Will when he's with Bedelia.
@juliajoy8 (do you watch #Hannibal by any chance? Ship #Hannigram?)
@juliajoy8 What other ships do you have, btw? I think once you mentioned Spuffy but I don't think we talked much more than that about it.
@juliajoy8 I think did tweet about it, though next time I'll DM you. :)
@juliajoy8 Now I'm excited for you to resume S9 of TXF, really crossing my fingers you can put MSR away for a bit, hard as it may be...
@juliajoy8 It just felt rambly without a warm-up, having been away for several weeks, and then BAAAAM dozens of DMs. lol #butyoureright
@san_da_lias I want this so badly now.
Some people really ARE put on this earth to do God's work 
Who's live-tweeting tonight's #AngelHeart episode, anyway? @rthompson1138? @mishacollins? @jensenackles? ...@TheOrlandoJones????
@VermilionBorder @DanglingThpider disappointed, if everything major that happen is given away by BTS pictures or sneak peeks.
@VermilionBorder @DanglingThpider the episode the way they have in the past, ruining pivotal moments because that too can make fans feel
@VermilionBorder @DanglingThpider Keeping spoiler free myself, but I know spoilers ARE out there and I hope they aren't taking away from the
@VermilionBorder @DanglingThpider Given the sunset pictures and how much everything has been hyped by fandom, disappointment seems likely.
blah. blah. blah. I'm so rambl-y today!

mulder &amp; scully | you 
ships! ships! ships!

*then sprinkles a little msr* 

:D
Mulder, but instead it pans to Scully. And she responds, "Actually, I decided to keep my name." AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! MY EMOTIONS! [2/2]
Read THE best headcanon on Tumblr about the premiere having someone call out, "Agent Mulder?" and all of us expecting it to pan to -- [1/2]
No, but really. Imagine the #XFilesRevival starting off with Mulder/Scully being married???? 
As you can see, when it comes to my #XFiles and my expectations, I have only two modes: Super panicky or super optimistic. No middle ground!
Yesterday, I read CC's quote about Mulder/Scully NOT being where they left off negatively. So they're separated? Today: So they're married??
Well, well, well. #AngelHeart is today. Bonus points if we can get either Robbie, Misha or Jensen to tweet the hashtag #DestielHeart. :)
@amandamichl As far as S11, would Jensen like to see Dean interacting more with Cas? This season they've had very little interaction. #Q2
@amandamichl Hello, Amanda. Could you please ask Jensen about Dean and Castiel and where they end up in the season finale? #Question1
"But when we come back we will find that relationship is not where we left it."

WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN??

*STARTS ANGSTING* #TXF
I typically love to read longer works, so I'm glad I can now contribute a similar work to the fandom.
It will, without a doubt, break 100k+ words, which is pretty fucking amazing.
Close to 80k on my #DCBB as of this morning. Using this week to do my first revision and then will continue to add more to it next week.
@feliciaday A book about THE book. ;-) #lol
@feliciaday I wish books came with DVD commentaries because I'd love to know your thought process writing this.
@feliciaday You ARE stunning on your book cover.
@margarita2083 @JossaDosBichos Ep Monday
I'm just happy we're finally getting some substantial Dean/Cas interaction tomorrow. It's been a long wait. @rthompson1138 #AngelHeart
All the Claire hate has nothing to do with fandom labeling her Dean/Cas's "adopted" daughter or the actress being so pro-Destiel, right? ;-)
Time Mark 2:30

Dean's POV in my DCBB is not being inspired by Frozen's "Let It Go". *scoffs* Of, course not. That would be ridiculous. Silly, really... ;-)

Ep 10.20 ‘Angel Heart’

Tag (#)DestielHeart 
April 29th 8pmET


I seriously thought I'd be writing this super dark, angsty, horror story, but I completely changed my intent for this fic. lol #random #dcbb
Plot twist: The goal of my DCBB is to be as positive and uplifting as possible.
@juliajoy8 My sister stopped like 3 eps before the finale with S9 and didn't finish it until a year later. lol The struggle is real. :D
@raelee514 Right. I almost forgot about that! They did such a good job keeping that under-wraps, then at the last minute, they spoiled it.
@raelee514 Hence, I'll probably take another month long hiatus to avoid spoilers for the last episodes.
@raelee514 Damn behind the scenes photos. Now, I'm trying to avoid ALL spoilers but they are pretty much everywhere.
@raelee514 I felt cheated out of the Sam/Rowena thing because it was so awesome, but then I was like, "wait, I knew this already."
@rthompson1138 OR...have Charlie mention the X-Files. Yes, yes, this would be nice. :)
@rthompson1138 Would you ever make a Mulder/Scully reference re: Dean/Cas? For season 11. Need this more than air. Please, do the thing.
@rthompson1138 So on the nose I almost missed it. Yeah, angry!cupid = tumblr. You nailed it. Us. Whatever. :D #hilarious #youlittleshit
@rthompson1138 I was literally thinking, "What does this mean???" connecting it to the 9x23 bar scene, but thinking there was more.
!!! RT @rthompson1138 Angry Cupid = possible band name or tumblr? #Supernatural
@Kosherart @Destiheller (with a side of Misha minions)
@Kosherart @Destiheller Right. Moose/Squirrel thing won't be universally understood, but pretty sure they are aiming for J2 niche market. ;)
Jared &amp; Jensen | Always Keep Fighting 
Everywhere I turn, I just see more and more spoilers. Bleh.
I don't know if it's just me, but lately SPN spoilers have been way too spoilery. I may have to take another break from social media.
@Destiheller Then again, I suppose Mark would have felt left out? I don't know...
@Destiheller I wish they had made it a J2M shirt. It's a great J2 design, of course, but to make it ALL inclusive.
Unless I'm reading it wrong, and Misha's involvement isn't direct. I admit, I only scanned the text briefly. ;-)
Why didn't they just present it as a J2M thing from the beginning and include Misha's face in the shirt? *confused*
The new represent campaign is a bit confusing because it sounds like a J2 thing, but then they are like "In addition, Misha..."
@rthompson1138 @robertberens "I JUST NEED MORE CHARLIE, OK??" me after every spn episode featuring charlie. #imnotokay #justgivememore
She's officially my favorite! *gently pushes Dean, Cas, Sam out of the way* #SPN @rthompson1138 #thingsthatarenotnew 
Mulder: "Now you know how I feel most of the time.”
(Wetwired) 
@juliajoy8 what?
Does fandom have a name for Dean/Sam/Cas/Charlie? Only seen TFW 2.0 but it feels like they should have a new name.
Everything is Charlie/Cas meeting and being instant BFFs, Castiel's halo, and the Winchester 2.0 family finally being together! :D #SPN
@tehjessicarae @squeemonster @Destiheller @mrstserc @angel_kist Apparently JA has been MIA due to a personal loss 
Pretty much. :) #agreed @NicePeachFuzz @mishacollins
@EW So a journalist is told a character is gay and they edit that out and go for a shock-value heteronormative headline? TY for the erasure!
.@mishacollins But thanks for the clarification!
Right, but queer erasure isn't a joke nor funny. So... RT @mishacollins Also, I occasionally joke.
Asshats. RT @mishacollins Those yelling at me, in the EW interview I said nothing would happen w/Cas because Charlie's gay, but it was cut.
@feliciaday But that has nothing to do with you or the amazing Charlie. #sohappy #youreback :)
@feliciaday So thrilled you're back tonight! Sorry if you're getting any negative tweets. This EW article was upsetting to a lot of us.
@shinzz1 Not a problem! :)
You're not upset. Congrats. You're queer and not upset? Double the congrats. Still doesn't change the fact that others are rightfully upset.
Point isn't shipping or crack shipping, especially not on an individual level. It's bringing this thinking to the masses.
So all these tweets saying or implying, "Shipping a lesbian with a guy isn't that big of a deal." You're missing the point.
FYI: A major media outlet and a person with 2 million followers erasing the lesbian status of a character is worthy of upset.
Wow, @mishacollins. You don't get it at all. Or aren't listening.
@shinzz1 treated as a "hater". Anyway, interested to see if your POV matches up with mine on this issue. :)
@shinzz1 Can I see that post? In the past I've done that to, said how Misha is not really what I'd label a supporter of D/C and gotten
Based on all these new tweets, let me guess. More problematic stuff?
Cannot wait to see this adorable face on #Supernatural tonight. 
@mishacollins Photo? Cute. Lesbian erasure? Not cute. #forfuturereference #EWinterview
@xEuphony @JoAnne_Hankey Pretty young woman MUST be there for Dean's sexual pleasure, right? #gross
@RosieTRiveter @JoAnne_Hankey 
"Supernatural isn't about sex!"
*random female appears*
"Oh, my god, is Dean gonna bang her?"

FACEPALM.GIF
@JoAnne_Hankey She does it with every randomly mentioned female. And has a sock account bashing D/C'ers for fetishizing/sexualizing Dean.
Mulder: [gets on the train]
JM tweets a photo of a female extra, and immediately "non-shippers" want her with Dean. THIS IS SEXUALIZING DEAN. 
Rest of fandom? Tries shipping Dean and Cas with EVERY single female character out there. Straight. Lesbian. Underage. Demon. Angel. ANYONE.
So, Destiel shippers carry the stigma of "sexualizing" Dean and Cas even though ALL we ship is Dean/Cas. That's it. Two people for 7 years.
#LRT:   
Mulder (to Scully): I know what you're afraid of. I'm afraid of the same thing.
Me: 



Mulder: ScullAYYYYY
People who aren't open w/ you but then want you to help them out. Laughing for a million years. Nah. You can fuck off. Desire to help? GONE.
@anon_unknown001 Who said that?
Remember that one time @DanneelHarris played a kickass lesbian in the movie #TheRoommate? Yeah, I do. :)
@charliescastiel I've watched this video 100x times. It's so perfect. It instantly makes me feel better no matter how crappy my day is. :)

keep saying shit like that and i'll ship my fist with your nose
@bilrac In fact, my exact "feeling" right now? Utterly grossed out. I may not even watch tonight's episode live as I had intended. UGHHHHHH.
@bilrac I've wanted 3 things from spn: 1) canon!destiel, 2) more charlie, 3) Cas/Charlie meeting. Now we're getting #3? Can't even be happy.
@rthompson1138 Any thoughts on a Charlie spin-off or comic book series, especially post-SPN? I'm VERY interested in this. :)
Charlie Bradbury || Brave 
*goes into a happy Charlie bubble*
@pasladeuxieme @DubiousCA Thanks. I need to create a list of media sources that are friendly to LGBTQ+ and those that are NOT.
@DubiousCA @rthompson1138 @mishacollins Agreed. Please do not RT.
@pasladeuxieme @DubiousCA without getting sucker punched by mainstream media and heteronormativity.
@pasladeuxieme @DubiousCA  It's like today of all days to get this kind of BS. We can't even enjoy a Charlie ep or Charlie/Cas meeting
@pasladeuxieme @DubiousCA *joins in*
GROSS. Didn't realize this was the headline. RT @EWTV @cw_spn star @mishacollins talks shipping Castiel and Charlie: 
Love my tumblr dash. Follow a limited amount of people. All are peeved right now. #feelsathome
Nice vent-y post. #thatshow #Charlie 
@celest_gw Anyway, really happy Charlie is back. Like a breath of fresh air in Supernatural. :)
@celest_gw You're free to interpret this as you want. I just hope I can do the same.
@EWTV You know, in case you actually care about your queer readers.
@EWTV Jokes about shipping with her with male-bodied characters generally won't go over well with queer fans.
@EWTV Suggestion: Have your reporters actually know the characters they discuss on their articles. Example: Charlie from SPN? LESBIAN.
@celest_gw Not sure how being part of queer erasure is "polite" but alright...
@destieluk And, TBH, I don't give a shit if everyone shrugs it away. The way queer fans feel about queer characters/queer rep is individual.
@destieluk Hey, you are not the only one. I literally feel like shit right now because of this.
Hope none of this was rooted in canon text and it was all nonsense from interviewer/interviewee.
The insecure part of me is now worried about tonight's episode. Even though it's an irrational fear. It's there.
@rootsvines @destieluk I didn't give JP a pass for his comment about women/SPN. I don't feel the need to give this a pass either.
THIS. Can you imagine JP saying this? No pass. RT (Also, I wouldn't give his co-stars a pass on this, so I can't in fairness do so for him)
@rootsvines @destieluk Use that famous bluntness and no bullshit attitude to protect queer rep, not you know, make a mockery of it.
@rootsvines @destieluk ITA. Of all people, blunt Misha Collins should have been the one to say, "You do know she's a lesbian, right?"
This. Doesn't he know better? #puzzled RT Squinting more at Misha than the interviewer tbh.
@fandom_ly True. But problematic comments are still problematic.
@fandom_ly @anon_unknown001 that Cas is NOT a "dudebro" &amp; in fact genderless (which I'd LOVE), it's just disturbing to bring Charlie into it
@fandom_ly @anon_unknown001 He may have switched vessels that one time with Claire, but that was years ago. Until the show makes it explicit
@fandom_ly @anon_unknown001 Absolutely. Cas is genderless but the show presents him as a straight dudebro staring at boobs.
@anon_unknown001 Reporters ignoring queer storytelling and subtext, though? Must be a day ending in Y.
@anon_unknown001 Right. But I disagree with so many things Misha says. But bringing Charlie into it. Meh. Rubs me the wrong way.
@anon_unknown001 Gross. Didn't need to know that part. Anyway, zoning out. Straight washing jokes are annoying.
@anon_unknown001 Was that all?
Do I even want to know about Misha's comment erasing Charlie's sexuality? Yeah, probably not. #zonesoutofthatfandom
@Destiheller Overheard: Denise can fuck off. :D
So, are @robertpatrickT2 and @annabethgish going to be part of the new TXF series? I'd love even a cameo. For reasons. :D #XFilesRevival

@robertberens This has been transparent from day one. Hard to believe CNN is still using her...
@SarahMac227 Lovely! Would love to have both of those images smashed together on a shirt! :D
@exorcisingemily Oh, do it. All those "They will NEVER happen" ships that happened. Would be a fantastic list to have. :D
@XFilesRevival exactly. same here.
@SarahMac227 Gorgeous artwork. Do you have more in this style? :)
That one time Mulder/Scully briefly cosplayed Hannibal/Clarice. #canon #TheTruth #Seaso9FavMoments
@XFilesRevival I love that you love #roadrunners. one of those eps that doesn't get much love because it's in season 8. lol
@XFilesRevival SAME. 8 or 9 when I first fell in love with TXF. Good times.

@JoAnne_Hankey I agree with the change, if it happens, but also rolling at my eyes at all those using this to attack the page. Transparent!
@JoAnne_Hankey They tag people all the time, but I guess I never realized it was counter-productive to do so.
@JoAnne_Hankey @ORgrannie @DubiousCA TY! :)
@ORgrannie Oh, okay. I was lost about what started this. Will go there and read. Thanks. :)
@ORgrannie @JoAnne_Hankey @DubiousCA *were THOSE...
@ORgrannie @JoAnne_Hankey @DubiousCA What good points were so? Just joined the conversation so a little lost.
@Destiel_Gina @meghaner It's probably BS, but I wouldn't mind seeing a truly evil Sam Winchester.
@Destiel_Gina @meghaner  Although that seems to be about this week's ep Sam/Rowena. The other was about the finale and a S9 reversal.
@Destiel_Gina @meghaner AWESOME. I may be one of the few people who wanted this. lol
@Destiel_Gina @meghaner Wait, so evil!Sam is a real spoiler already confirmed somewhere? Do you have a link?
@anqqi_ @rachel_wisdom It's not even a "want" with me anymore. It's just automatic, like Pavlov's dog. They baited the story so much...
Good ol' tumblr. Ye giveth, and ye taketh away. #sameoldsong
@juliajoy8 The S9 finale will put a band-aid on your pain, though.
@juliajoy8 But as for Mulder, literally that's all you see of him until the finale. *sad sigh*
@juliajoy8 I felt I didn't prepare you enough, but wasn't sure how to say things without giving everything away. lol

*sees suitcases*

*instant disappointment*
@juliajoy8 right??? #lameintrosFTW
@juliajoy8 rotlmao. i'll quote you on that later on. ;-)
@juliajoy8 (like... 5 seconds? =P)
@juliajoy8 For the record, how long was it into 9x01 before you felt disappointed?
@juliajoy8 IMO, season 9 undid Season 8's "truth" so they could get away with what ultimately happens to William. /bitter theories
@juliajoy8 lol well Samanthat's arc had like 8 years to be contradictory. This arc is only S8 v. S9 canon.
@juliajoy8 It's literally a retcon. Remember the Samantha story arc and how convoluted and contradictory it became? That's William's S9 arc.
After three years of nephilim!canon, I finally found one person who talks about D/C's possible offspring. I'm not alone! =P
X-Files // polarity magnetics (Mulder&amp;Scully): 
#TheyGoThere: Dean trades the impala for a bmw to go green.
#TheyGoThere: Castiel gets a guinea pig.
#TheyGoThere: Sam gets highlights.
@rachel_wisdom And what pisses me off is that they KNOW what we are going to think, so if it's not that, it's just being cruel and bait-y.
*deepest sigh ever* RT @rachel_wisdom  I'm very upset now ugh
@juliajoy8 No apologies needed! And I hope that answer was sufficient, but if you want to know something more specific, just ask me. :)
Then I remembered what show we're talking about, and got really pissed. lol
SPN actor saying about the finale "THEY GO THERE." Hmm..what do they want us to think?? RT @rachel_wisdom what did I miss help please!!!!!
@mysourcessay85 @juliajoy8 it's funny because he returned in the comics too. it's like no matter the medium: CSM will return! =P
@mysourcessay85 @juliajoy8 lol well that doesn't count here. Just ask CSM who is returning for the new season.
@mysourcessay85 @juliajoy8 Though technically, there could have been a 2nd movie with Mulder/Scully NOT together just like S1-7. ;-)
@juliajoy8 sorry this was long-winded... "Is there a happy ending?" Yes, and no. If you think of season 8 as (cont) 
@juliajoy8 Give me a sec so I can send you some info on S9....
@anqqi_ Very Darth Vader-esque! LOL 
@JPLabGuru S9 is really more of a spin-off. If you ended with S8, then that's probably for the best. ;-)
@JPLabGuru Those are all season 8.
@JPLabGuru  episodes in terms of ~horror then S9 is a goldmine. Have you seen: Daemonicus, 4D, Scary Monsters, Hellbound? All S9 episodes.
@JPLabGuru It's a Doggett-centric episode about his son. It's not "horror" so much as drama. But if you're looking for more Hannibal-esque
@margarita2083 @YorkAshley @FuckUUFknFucker That movie hurts my heart.
@JPLabGuru S9's "Release"...
This episode is right after #William
Because Satan organized the season
But I watched #SunshineDays first, then this one.
#ForHealthReasons
The way this episode is directed is very #Hannibal-esque. Probably why I loved Hannibal so much. The score and cinematography are top-notch.
Watching #Release.  What an exquisite episode of television. #TXF #9x17 
@juliajoy8 Minus the mytharc episodes, S9 is a pretty quality season. But if you watch the mytharc eps, then as a MS fan, you suffer. A lot.
@juliajoy8 think it would do well, ratings-wise, without a connection to Mulder and Scully. But really, S8 should have been the end.
@juliajoy8 Money? IDK... Season 9 should have been a complete spin-off, a new unit of TXF with Doggett/Reyes. But they probably didn't
TXF S8 = closing chapter
TXF S9 = epilogue
IWTB = time-stamp
New TXF = sequel? 

Yes? Yes.
Final thoughts on Mulder/Scully leaving season 8... @juliajoy8 
@juliajoy8 (oh goodness...the ending is perfect, and then we get another "ending" in season 9...that is pretty pitch-perfect for them too)
ALL OF THIS. RT @juliajoy8 agreed completely! I couldn't have asked for a better conclusion. So simple. So lovely. So sweet. So them.
@juliajoy8 I KNOW. It was like the most perfect way to answer every question we had about their relationship.
So all the pain, mystery, doubt was worth it? In the end? RT @juliajoy8 @mysourcessay85 yup yup and I don't regret it for a second :) :) :)
@juliajoy8 They set 'em up. We knocked 'em down! #questions #answer #alwayslove
@juliajoy8 I just love that whole intro. Stunning. And the final reveal? So effortless, and elegant. Beautiful and profound. #allthefeels
@juliajoy8 "An answered prayer? A true miracle? What do I tell this child about to be born? What do I tell Scully? What do I tell myself."
@juliajoy8 "How did this child come to be? What set its heart beating? Is it the product of a union? Or the work of a divine hand?"
@juliajoy8 love this quote: "We call it the miracle of life. Conception: A union of perfect opposites-- essence transforming into existence"
"The truth we both know" :D @juliajoy8 
"@juliajoy8 I AM CRYING I AM DEAD I AM DECEASED I CANNOT GO ON" 
@MadMakNY IT HURTS SO BAD. I WAS TRYING NOT TO CRY TOWARD THE END, AND THEN I JUST STARTED SOBBING.
@JossaDosBichos Ugh....I just can't...
I'm so depressed now. :\ #TXF #William
I started watching #William earlier today, btw, but my internet connection went out. So I just finished watching it.
I've had what? 13 years to get over this? Well, still NOT fucking over it. #TXF
"Supernatural is sadder than The X-Files I said." I FUCKING LIED.
#William just ripped my heart out and stomped on it 
mulder: do u believe in aliens
scully: no mulder stop
mulder: would u LIKE to …
@/Caro_Utah @valgreen660 @chrisschmelke LMAO to "would love pics of all 3 together" which is never the case when a J2 pic comes out. :)
@MadMakNY It's such a compelling episode too. Literally the only flaw is what happens to William. That's it. Otherwise: 5 star episode.
Co-written by David/Carter/Spotnitz &amp; directed by DD, it's so well done, but within the first 5 minutes I need to punch someone in the face.
I both love and hate this episode. #TXF #William
I said I was skipping the mythos episodes, but then why am I crying?

Oh, right, I decided to watch #William. I am a sadist. :( #TXF
me: [belts out the lyrics to wrecking ball]
Hate the mythos. Hate the lack of Mulder. But you cannot hate the standalone episodes. So good! #TXF #season9
Still having a wonderful time watching season 9 of TXF. Minus the mythos episodes, this is one of the most solid seasons of the series.
Felicia Day is just asdfghjkjhgfdswdfghjklkjhgfdefg.
@feliciaday Why are you so beautiful? This picture hurts the essence of my being. #radiatingbeauty #toomuchperfection #needsawarning

Watching "Scary Monsters," which is a fantastic tribute to one of my favorite Twilight Zone eps, "It's a Good Life." 
They are so worth the wait! Spoiler alert: FEEEEEELS! MT @juliajoy8 saving the last two for tomorrow night lol. I don't want it to endddd :(
@juliajoy8 You'll be surprised what ultimately happens with Kersh. ;-)
@juliajoy8 We see her again in S9's #ScaryMonsters, which I'm watching right now. :D She's so much fun. I love her wide knowledge of TXF!!
@juliajoy8 What did you think of Leyla Harrison? She's TXF's fan tribute.

@VeinotteValerie @YorkAshley I hear a lot of good things about the show, so I may try to marathon the first season. Is it on season 2 now?
@VeinotteValerie @YorkAshley Is the relationship similar to MSR? I only watched maybe 2 episodes of season 1 and couldn't tell.
@YorkAshley @VeinotteValerie It's so hard to say. At best, this year in the fall. At latest next summer. :)
@YorkAshley @VeinotteValerie I AM SO EXCITED TO RELIVE THIS SHOW WITH FANS/FANDOM. :)
@YorkAshley @VeinotteValerie You ARE going to watch it live soon. And we're going to have twitter and tumblr and DD/GA only a tweet away!
Would the NHI allow it? We shall see. 

(remember that time we sent TPTB some M&amp;Ms....) Good times. 

We're so sweet. Get it. =P
Someone made some chocolate "ship" cookies for Destiel on tumblr. Halp. 
I want some so badly. Maybe we can send some to the writers. lol
It's the most believable, profound love story! RT @YorkAshley  it shows just how much they care for each other. It's so deep. ugh asdfghjkl
@YorkAshley Can't think of anything more romantic!
@YorkAshley series beautiful to me. It ended in such a full circle way. The characters coming so far, and ending up in each others' arms.
@YorkAshley And their very last moment together? Recalling how their first night together in a hotel in the pilot? That makes the entire
@YorkAshley All the MSR moments in the finale are worth a million other moments in any other show. They were so perfect.
The world was coming to an end, and they had lost it all, but at least they had each other. RT @YorkAshley the series final made up for it.
@YorkAshley They just had to make MSR tragic, you know. An actual TRAGEDY, because happiness was too mainstream for them.
@YorkAshley *rocks back and forth* I do not want to watch William. Nope. I'm safely watching non-mytharc episode to keep my sanity. :D
"@YorkAshley @AllThingsMSR "until then I'll remain forever yours" 
Asdfghjk" 
Correction. I was trying to avoid the pain/feels of S9 but @YorkAshley is doing a great job sucking me back into the MSR. =P
@YorkAshley The emails and how Scully desperately wants to reconnect with Mulder but misses him in the last second. So painful. :(
The opening to #TrustNo1 is my life. Never loved an intro more! RT @YorkAshley 'trust no1' I love but it's so painful their emails I cry
@davidduchovny Aww, that's so sweet. :)
@rthompson1138 Are you going to have office hours for Book of the Damned? I have a lot of questions for you. :D
Having a great time rewatching season 9 of The X-Files. Just skipping all the mythology episodes to avoid the pain and the feels. #smartplan
She's so Mulder here, it makes me very happy. #TXF #Improbable
Reyes is so freakin' adorable! *fangirl squee* #TXF #Improbable
"Let's get our Alan Turing on! Decrypt this bitch!" My love is back on @cw_spn! asdfghjkljhgfdfghjklfghjk #BookOfTheDamned @rthompson1138

@Quanticofbi @Sophistication1 I was watching that just a while ago but my internet went out and I had to unplug my netflix. lol
#ThrowbackThurs #TheXFiles 
@doggettscully Same I had mine in my desk area up until maybe 6 months ago when I cleaned up. One of my favorite TXF photoshoots!
Of course he's still alive... of course he is... .^__^ #TXF
my personal favorite 
Cute kitten photos to make up for all the gruesome pics I've posted. :D 
Would have enjoyed both episodes more, if they didn't try to make any of the main characters "part" of the reincarnation bit. #TXF
Though I always feel #Hellbound goes one step too far by tying it to Reyes, like #TheFieldWhereIDied goes to far with the Mulder connection.
Mulder: "Partaaayyy!" 
Reyes is so kickass in this episode! #TXF #Hellbound
Now watching #Hellbound. Definitely the best horror episode of season 9. #TXF 
romantic love isn't a genre

M: "It's killer cockroaches!"

S: "Are you sure, Mulder? Maybe it's an allergy to roaches? Drug induced hallucination? unrelated aneurysm?"
"It's telekinesis!"
"Oh, no, it's a poltergeist."

"It's aliens!" 
"Oh, no it's a mass hallucination brought on by a network of mushrooms!"
the truth is always somewhere in the middle. So Mulder tends to tweak his theory as the episode progresses.
And usually, neither is 100% right. Even if Mulder always bets on the supernatural explanation, and TXF eps are usually supernatural --
I love how ever TXF ep, you essentially get Mulder's "out there" theory followed by a list of more plausible explanations from Scully.
She can usually offer pretty sound explanations for any situation, but she's always open to finding the truth, whatever it may be.
#LRT:  Scully is an open-minded skeptic, as opposed to her being closed minded. She's a skeptic because of her background in hard science.
"So, it's like Mulder and Scully?" 
I think she gets it.
REST IN PIECES ME
@raelee514 you were never told your sexuality was a "sin" or "perversion".
@raelee514 Or fear that what you like is "wrong" and will be judged by others. So that causes an internal struggle that may not be there if
@raelee514 I think a lot of people ARE clear on what they like. IMO, a lot of people's confusion arises from fear of not being accepted.
@raelee514 (literally never went through a "what am I" phase. Like my sexuality was never a question mark for me)
@raelee514 Though I'm bisexual and have dated both men and women. But my first crushes I remember were definitely female.
@raelee514 During that time when I considered myself too young to have real crushes? A neighbor of mine. We held hands a lot! ;-)
In fact, the first crushes I formed early on...talking about 7-9 years old, were mostly girls with one exception. lol
Um, no. I never had a "straight phase". I had an "in the closet" phase, sure, but I can't remember a day I wasn't attracted to girls.
Weird post going around tumblr via D/C tags about how every queer person came out of the womb straight. And we all had a straight phase.
Gillian &amp; Robert. #Scully #Doggett #TXF 
Everything hurts. #JohnDoe #9x07 #Doggett 
@Quanticofbi @margarita2083 @VeinotteValerie I turn away during the graphic scenes, so that helps. :)
@Quanticofbi @margarita2083 @VeinotteValerie Later I returned to it, and was able to handle it better. Now I've seen each season 4x+ times.
@Quanticofbi @margarita2083 @VeinotteValerie Oh, same. Watch the first season live. Quit about 8 eps in due to the content.
@VeinotteValerie I wish you so much luck with that, hon! *hugs* :)
#LRT: Scully is going to look like that, but with red hair in the new season. asdfghjklkjhgdfghjkl I am not ready. #gilliansbeauty #blinding
David already compared it to Hannibal. YIKES! RT @Quanticofbi @margarita2083 @VeinotteValerie dread to think how scary the new stuff will be
@margarita2083 Ooh, that is a creepy one! And super underrated. Not the best of TXF, but the horror elements are A+.
@VeinotteValerie With TXF back, I'm sure they will be doing a ton of events.
"This pizza has too much cheese," said no one ever! :)

(okay, I'm kind of saying it right now though. so much cheese) #personal
@VeinotteValerie Of course Joss added so much to the MoTW/mytharc format. Love BTVS!
@VeinotteValerie SPN too, lots of borrowed writers/directors from TXF worked on SPN (early seasons). BTVS too, format wise owes it to TXF.
@Quanticofbi @VeinotteValerie And he brought pizza, that's always a plus. ;-)
@Quanticofbi @VeinotteValerie I was like "Company!" *sighs in relief*
@Quanticofbi @VeinotteValerie Sorry! LOL These scary eps are addicting. I was watching them alone, but my brother just dropped by.
"It's an AU. Of course we're going to slice people's throats &amp; blow off their heads. There's nothing wrong with us." TXF, probably... #4D
First 5 minutes of #4D: Kill off two leads. Okay, X-Files. We get it. We got ourselves a badass here. Simmer down. 
@VeinotteValerie @Quanticofbi The whole episode feels like one big acid trip to hell. lol
@VeinotteValerie @Quanticofbi The concept alone - the devil, possession, etc - is chilling enough. But the way it was directed too is scary.
(And in the distance, you can hear the concept behind #Fringe being developed. Just kidding.) #alternateworlds #TXF #4D
And now #4D. This one is about a serial killer jumping dimensions to get away with murder. Because, why else would you jump dimensions???
"TXF" horror episodes make "Supernatural" episodes look like episodes of my little pony. #justsaying #thisishorror
This episode scares the shit out of me. #Daemonicus #XFiles 
SHOT FIRED. SHOTS FIRED. #Daemonicus #DSR #MSR 
"Clearly, you have feelings for her. But you can't compete with the long-lost Agent Mulder. With his easy good looks, his Oxford education."
I'll be okay. 
It's not like I'm home alone and it's getting dark outside or anything.

 ^____^
Because #Alone wasn't scary enough, apparently.
Had to truly traumatize myself by watching an ep about the devil.
Yeah, I'm watching #Daemonicus now.
SCULLY: For the past eight years I was part of a unit known as the X-Files. 
CADET: Ever slay a vampire? 

:D
@anqqi_ ROTLMAO. But whyyy do you all find it so scary???
asdfghjhgfdsdfghjk Scully going through her old keepsakes. Apollo 11 medallion. Queequeg's tag! The merged penny/dime from Dreamland. #Alone
That intro was pretty scary but as soon as the theme song starts, I felt such relief. I find it rather soothing. *shrugs*
It's funny how some people were traumatized as kids by TXF theme song, but I don't know.
Crap. I'm watching this episode ALONE, and it's called ALONE. lol

(forgot this is mildly scary...)
Yep, watching #Alone. 

That episode where Mulder is most certainly NOT jealous. 

No, siree!
I was going to watch "Released" but I may watch "Alone" instead.

It's like, do I want to feel complete pain or joy? 

LOL
*don't think about scully in 'this is not happening'*
*don't think about the difference*
*don't do it*
*don't*
OH GOD. I'M THINKING ABOUT IT
Scully is absolutely ~beaming. Look at her: 
God. They are so precious together. 
Scully is such a sweet, caring, nurturing person. And Mulder, I don't know, sometimes he reminds me of a child. Needing exactly that.
Can we just talk about how overjoyed she is with Mulder's gift. No matter what he would have given her, she would have loved it.
Scully: Wondering what on earth you could have given me.
Mulder: And?
Scully: (gasps) Oh my god. Oh my...Mulder.

Her reaction! asdfghjkljh
Mulder: Bet you forgot about that, didn't you?
Scully: No, I didn't. I thought about it a lot while I was lying in my hospital bed.
But then Mulder/Scully appear and it's like all other ship possibilities fade into the background. *happy sigh* #TXF #MSR #isstronginthisone
The struggle NOT to ship Scully/Reyes and Scully/Doggett is REAL. #8x17
SCULLY: Agent Reyes? [...] I like her.
MULDER: You're nothing at all alike.
SCULLY: Well, then neither are you and I. 
Every Mulder/Scully moment in this episode is just... 
Sometimes my OTP is so rude. #TXF #empedocles 
@juliajoy8 I love that you love Reyes. So much to love. She's amazing. &lt;333
Seriously, if I'm wearing my Mulder/Scully goggles I love S8, ~hate S9.
If I'm wearing my Doggett/Reyes goggles, I love both. lol #TXF #POVs
S8 for M&amp;S fans: Pain! Feels! Joy!
S9 for M&amp;S fans: *hissing noise* 

S8 for D&amp;R fans: asdfghjkhgfdsdfgh
S9 for D&amp;R fans: asdfghjkhgfdsdfgh
@juliajoy8 Well at least the "baseball" lesson was a perfect gift.  (oh, and the baby. that was nice of Mulder.) :D
@juliajoy8 And we have yet another bad present from Mulder. First the medallion from like S4. Now this ugly doll. lol
@juliajoy8 (you hit on all the big moments, I'm here laughing at all the little moments) #lol
@juliajoy8 The awkwardness at the hospital. Nurse to Mulder: "Are you her husband?" then 5 seconds later to Doggett, "Are YOU the husband?"
@juliajoy8 You forgot to mention the pizza man. lol We have two ships where that's a thing now. #MSR #Destiel #pizzaman
@juliajoy8 Just started watching Empedocles. I came for the Doggett backstory, but the MSR pulled me in again. asdfghjkl;lkjhgfdsfghjklkjh
@Emmybm15 ITA. They should be canon. They already feel like it.
@anqqi_ I've been trying to convince my girlfriend to join, so you've got me. If you think of a selling point, let me know. :D
!!! 
Dean ruffled Castiel's hair as Cas kneeled in front of him taking off his pants. Cas is Dean's valet in the fic.

JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL!!!
oh, there's a part 2. of course there is. 
@CaitlinCMiller lol #metoo
@juliajoy8 (though sometimes i want to add #spoilers to my tweets but feel silly because txf ended in 2002) #lmao
@juliajoy8 I may not even tweet. It depends on my mood.
Downton Abbey Destiel fanfiction?? Fuck. I needed this in my life.

@juliajoy8 They actually dig into it in 8x17 "Empedocles" although in an X-Files fashion which is weird and (cont) 
@TheCancelBear Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. People have a right to have hope until the very end. It's not like you're right 100% of the time.
Hey, @ABCNetwork, can you NOT cancel #Forever? One of the few decent shows out there. At least give it a second season. Limited run?
@ada_lso I freaking love #Forever though. :(
@juliajoy8 That episode is 100% Doggett-centric, and deals with his son, and oh...so many feels. :(
@juliajoy8 Mulder lost a sister. Doggett lost a son. So much of their journey is driven by pain. "Release" (9x17) is one of my fav episodes.
@juliajoy8 Interestingly, even though Doggett fills the "skeptic" role (aka is more of a Scully prototype), his background is so Mulder.
@juliajoy8 

*clutches onto Doggett* 

*soothingly pets him* 

*hisses at Mulder whenever he comes close to him* :D
@juliajoy8 Although the finale has a lot of Mulder/Doggett "to the rescue!" type moments. lol
@juliajoy8 Well that episode sort of has Mulder understand what Doggett means to Scully. We never really get a Mulder/Doggett/Scully team-up
"You can check out at any time.
But you can never leave."

- The X-Files fandom, probably...
"@VermilionBorder @juliajoy8 I have reached DeanSam levels of codependency w/ the x-files. I cannot stop watching it" 
@VermilionBorder Yes, we were talking about that! TXF for the first time? That's awesome. :) What episode are you on?
@juliajoy8 Yeah, it's like Mulder returns and you get the WHOLE spectrum of emotion: fear, desperation, agony, loss, relief, joy, hope, etc.
We have a winner. Though I was never happy with how Mulder treated Doggett.RT @juliajoy8  it's prob mixed with some jealousy,
@juliajoy8 That is a GREAT episode for everyone: Mulder, Scully, Doggett, the baby. lol
"@juliajoy8 And I think he does too?? But like. Everything is scary" The next episode, Empedocles, is going to touch base with M&amp;S a bit.
@juliajoy8 But it gets resolved, and you see where they stand.
@juliajoy8 You get to see how MSR stands with DSR and how the three fit in. Mulder also is noticeably jealous, in his Mulder-way. lol
@juliajoy8 And now there is a new agent on the X-Files. And Scully obviously cares for him. 8x19 is actually a GREAT episode for this.
@juliajoy8 life moved on without him. He comes back and Scully is pregnant. Who is the father? Does he know? Does Scully? WE DON'T KNOW.
@juliajoy8 No, it's not all magically okay, and you see Mulder struggling to "fit" back in throughout the whole season because essentially
@juliajoy8 Wow, yes, that was a lot of feels. lol *goes back and tries to digest them*
Going to make myself a strawberry/mango smoothie! #Yum
@juliajoy8 How are your feels today?
@juliajoy8 Oh, wow. You tackled all three together? 13-15? No wonder you were speechless.
@juliajoy8 Are you watching 8x14 &amp; 8x15 this week?
"@juliajoy8 uggGGGGGhhgGghHHhHhHhHhhhHhHHHHhh" I like this reaction.
Naturally. RT @juliajoy8 I'm just gonna ignore everything and assume it's Mulder's <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@juliajoy8 I'm not joking: Literally the last 30 seconds of the episode. LMAO.
@Support She pretty much dedicates all her twitter time to stalking others. Creepy. 
Anything you can do about it? --&gt; @/J2Brothers
@Support @DubiousCA I've also blocked this user (@J2Brothers) and she continues to tweet me.
@juliajoy8 Well, now that you've seen the episode, I can give you a bit more information on the season, (cont) 
*nervously exits twitter* 

Get mad at me tomorrow when I'm well-rested, k? :) #txt #8x14 #8x15
NO LIE DETECTED. RT @juliajoy8 I'm not READY
*casually scrolls back to my tweets from the other day*

(because I totally forget what I say from one day to the next) #badmemory #txf
@doggettscully @juliajoy8 Yeah, on BTVS, I shipped Buffy with EVERYONE, so I've lived the life of a multishipper before. And then some. :D
@juliajoy8 actually that smiley was inappropriate for 8x14-8x15 (pretend I didn't do that)
@juliajoy8 You mean 8x13??? asdfghjgfdsdfgh For that ep, though, definitely don't be nervous. After that...  [comments censored] :)
@juliajoy8 It was never my thing, though I love Doggett, love Doggett/Scully, and don't mind DSR (in general, just not my thing).
@juliajoy8 But if you do feel that way, then maybe you should watch some of S9.. lol They sort of try to push DSR (Doggett/Scully romance).
BLASPHEMY! =P RT @juliajoy8 If I wasn't so utterly hopelessly in love with MSR i'd probably love Scully x Doggett ;)
2 strikes. 2 more to go. #lol
I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.
I'm so scared.
#SPNFinale 
(unless it's a distraction method. We're all worried for D or S for 40 minutes of the finale, then bam goodbye angel in the last 2 minutes).
So Death will be in the SPN finale? Does that mean Castiel will be safe? Death doesn't reap angels, right? So it has to be Dean or Sam?
#timeline #imeanttimeline #spendingtoomuchtimeontumblr
But I realized how screwed I am wanting that for this show. We never had a chance, did we? *sobs* @InsideBates
Meanwhile, @InsideBates is getting so intense this season. I just want a happy ending, you know.
There is so much #Hannibal, #Hannigram, and #Bedelia on my dash. 
You guys, I'm getting so excited for @NBCHannibal's return! :)
@mishacollins: Thanks, Dad. :) @StarMinion
"@StarMinion I know!! It was the most stupid annoying thing to me and now I find it hysterical." So say we all. Courtesy of @mishacollins.
@StarMinion It was literally the creepiest thing ever until DAD complained about it. Then it became hip. ;-) #imsoimmature #dadmisha
@StarMinion I don't blame you. It's Misha. ;-) Plus the dad thing is hilarious now.
@StarMinion Though I did find the the video funny. Of course mostly for Misha's "et ~tey, brute" butchering. lol It's Et TU, Brute. lol
@StarMinion Ditto. Has he been problematic again this season? Ignored him since S8. :D
We Played Would You Rather: Fandom Edition With These 'Supernatural' Stars 
Perfect answer is perfect. Fandom approves! @RobBenedict @dicksp8jr #destiel 
@dicksp8jr Suddenly the "marry Sam" makes sense. Though you do know you inserted yourself into a Wincest-sandwich, right. ;-) #SabrielFTW
oops, that was actually @dicksp8jr's hilarious answer. Gotta readjust my mental picture. =P @RobBenedict
I mean, it's been what? 3 seasons since Cas has died? You know TPTB are just itching to blow up my baby or do something cruel to him. :( :(
(although any time I see "kill Cas" or anything death related my heart seizes up for a moment before my brain understands its not a spoiler)
lmao to @RobBenedict's "and you know exactly what that means I'm going to do to Dean." Well, played, sir. 
preemptively tweeting this for someone on my timeline... 
@juliajoy8 I rewatched that episode yesterday. One of my favorites precisely because of what you said!
@FateOfCastiel And that logic is pretty widespread among the Joffreys (trolls).
Are we protecting JA from slash and fanfiction, or are we saying he ships slash and writes fanfiction? LMAO. Joffrey talk 101. #trolls
Fans who believe:
"Stop making JA uncomfortable with Destiel &amp; fanfiction"
Coupled with:
"JA ships Wincest so hard! Bet he writes fanfic"
I literally need a decontamination shower right about now. #personal
Guys, respect Misha. Stop calling him dad. Start calling him mom. #kidstoday
Wait a minute...

Tobias Beecher = Will Graham
Chris Keller = Hannibal Lecter

@bryanfuller @NBCHannibal 
@JaxOfBo I'm starting to get really excited about. Will definitely be counting down the days until Hannibal returns, as well. Cannot wait!
*drowns in Hannigram fanvideos*

The crack videos are THE best though.
Damn. @NBCHannibal's hiatus has been so long I'm not even sure what I ship more: #Hannigram or #Hannidelia. Need to make up my mind by 06/04
How are Hannigram shippers, anyway? *peaks in the tags*

(we get out of hibernation June 4th, btw. Beware). :D
Except Hannigram. Hannigram is all pain. You literally need to accept Satan as your lord and savior to ship it.
Just because a ship is depressing as fuck, doesn't mean it doesn't have moments that make up for all of that. #ships #fyi
MULDER: A virtual reality of their own worst nightmares.
SCULLY: Like me thinking that you'd betray me.
SCULLY: He's lied to me from the very beginning. He NEVER trusted me.
MULDER: Scully, you are the ONLY one I trust. 
i love this. 
@YorkAshley Yup. Because after all the doubts the season tried to make viewers have, Mulder and Scully both knew the truth in their hearts.
@RosieTRiveter @tehjessicarae @ORgrannie @poptivist That sounds about right. Thanks for sharing!
@tehjessicarae @ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @poptivist Though when it's about people I love, 1 negative definitely carries a lot of weight.
@tehjessicarae @ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @poptivist Now, I don't know. I get sentimental over positive feedback and filter out the negative.
@tehjessicarae @ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @poptivist But I wonder WHY that happens. When I was younger, I went through that.
@ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @tehjessicarae @poptivist I wonder why some people do that. The psychology of that...
@ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @tehjessicarae @poptivist Especially about how he could get 100+ pos feedback but focus on the 1 negative.
@ORgrannie @RosieTRiveter @tehjessicarae @poptivist Finally watched it. Had to find a computer with better audio. But really sad.
You have to be a real douchebag (Metatron level) to have Misha personally tell you to fuck off. #Nancy444
Exercising to the point of making yourself good. Oh, I fucked up. :(
@RosieTRiveter @Destiheller @tehjessicarae rotlmao.
@tehjessicarae @RosieTRiveter She's such a nasty person. Imagine someone like that constantly attacking Jared? That fan wouldn't last.
@tehjessicarae @RosieTRiveter Oh, okay. Thank you. Do you have the link to Nancy's posts about RA?
@juliajoy8 *beliefs
@juliajoy8 open and she is compensating for Mulder's loss, and I think in this episode she finally see/admits that.
@juliajoy8 tries to be that strong, but the event shakes her, because at her core, she's not there yet. So while she's open, she's not that
@juliajoy8 that will put a boy's life at risk. Mulder may have had the courage and strength of his believes to follow through, and Scully
@juliajoy8 Well, she's been open all season 8 but in this episode she can't just be open. She has to back up that belief with an action
@RosieTRiveter @tehjessicarae @poptivist Is this related to RA or Kathryn Newton?
Joffs: Just admit you hate Jared/Sam as much as we hate Misha/Cas.
Castiel/Misha/Destiel fans: (in unison) NOOOOOOOOOOO.
And last tweet, literal reaction to EVERY Jared/Sam event @ProfoundBondInc held.
Joffs: *protects every actress who portrays a character they feel will get between Dean/Cas*
Joffs: *throws Kathyrn Newton to the wolves*
@RosieTRiveter (is there a transcript of that video, btw?)
@RosieTRiveter Can you explain to me what Misha said about Nancy? Did he address her directly? What about Kathryn?
@juliajoy8 mechanism. Ow. that hurt my heart. :)
@juliajoy8 You know, now that Mulder is gone, someone has to believe, but instead of making it a light switch moment, they make it a coping
@juliajoy8 Pretty genius to connect her evolution from hard skeptic to soft believer and make it at first about Mulder and her loss.
@anqqi_ But in between you get a lot of MSR. lol explicit or implicit, that never stopped Mulder/Scully's romance from killing us. :D
@anqqi_ S7 really confirms it, but rather vaguely/subtextually, and then S8 at the very end puts the official explicit stamp on it.
David comparing The X-Files reboot to Hannibal gives me life!
Literally ONLY two shows I can rewatch over and over: TXF and Hannibal.
@juliajoy8 *gives all the awards to gillian*
"@juliajoy8  Scully crying at the end of 8x10 <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> She misses Mulder so much IT HURTS" SHE TRIES SO HARD TO BE STRONG. 
"I think what we both feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know." #TXF
@betty_days @museatplay Probably because shipping is a random choice but how canon their love is is pretty obvious even to non-shippers. ;-)
spn wank on my timeline. must be time for me to get back to work.
@juliajoy8 *last 5 minutes of the S9 finale, I meant...
@juliajoy8 In fact, you can probably just watch the last 5 minutes of the finale to get that final MSR moment. But that's it. lol
@juliajoy8 Okay, well if you want a picture perfect fairy tale happy ending? Stop at 8x23. Do not watch ANY of Season 9.
@anqqi_ @CastieIsAssbutt @DestielAlways Definitely not characteristic to Destiel/cockles shippers. This person must be high.
@anqqi_ @CastieIsAssbutt @DestielAlways 2-5 is literally spn gossip every single date, dating back 5+ years.
@juliajoy8 Let's just say, with the GOOD, often comes the BAD. *sighs*
@juliajoy8 *pointedly ignores the rest of your tweet*
@juliajoy8 I'd never thought about it that way. Nicely done.
"@juliajoy8 I mean I guess they're not TOTALLY mulderless because baby? ;)" 
@juliajoy8 
S9 eps with Mulder:
9x01 (Mulder nod)
9x06 (Mulder nod, small MSR recap...)
9x19 &amp; 9x20 (regular status, 2 part series finale)
@juliajoy8 
S8 eps with Mulder:
8x11 and 8x13 (flashbacks only)
8x14 and 8x15 (currently, but minimal)
8x16 through 8x21 (regular status)
One emotinal Doggett/Scully scene followed by another emotional Mulder/Scully scene. I can't take them back-to-back! 
Last 5 minutes of Per Manum are like watching a double rainbow. #TXF
Per Manum is like an episode that fills a fanfic gap, but in doing so creates a million other fanfic gaps. I-I have no real issue wih that.
I randomly started watching #PerManum. I just needed some MSR. #S8 #8x13
@juliajoy8 (I do rewatch a handful of horror eps yearly, though. They are insanely awesome). #4D #HellBound #Daemonicus #ScaryMonsters
@juliajoy8 TBH, I don't think I've watched S9 more than once. The overarching mythology is a mess, and just unravels what S8 sets up fr M&amp;S.
@juliajoy8 But I can explain what happened, and then we can ignore canon together. :D
@juliajoy8 Yeah, really if you skip to the 2 part finale, that's best. Although you're going to be in for a HUGE what-the-fuck MSR moment.
@juliajoy8 and you miss it nods to Mulder in 2-3 other eps.
@juliajoy8 even LESS Scully, and many eps having much more Doggett/Reyes. And Mulder really only returning for ONE ep with a few blink it
@juliajoy8  I believe GA wanted some time off as well, which is why there is also a bit less Scully. Then by S9, it's really a spin-off with
@juliajoy8 He agreed to return for some episodes, I believe 12. But TXF's lead role was given to Robert Patrick (Doggett).
@juliajoy8 Yeah, 8x08 and 8x09 are among my least favorite eps. As for Mulder, a few more eps. But like I had said earlier, David left TXF.
@juliajoy8 What episode are you on?
Dean's soul + Castiel's grace. I ship it. #Season10 #Supernatural
@Farnathi asdfghjhgfdsdfg thank you!
And it's just like Supernatural to do something like that. All sneaky. "Hey we're just curing Dean." "YOU MADE THEM SOULMATES YOU ASSHOLES."
Because Dean will forever carry Castiel's grace inside him, and I cannot deal with that. Soulmates. Literally. Soul-bonded. Forever. Halp.
I will NOT make it out alive of S10 if Castiel's grace is used to save/purify Dean.
God bless the universe. There is actually more than one version of that deleted kiss. 
@Farnathi Hmmm...interesting. Alright. I'll definitely read it then.
@Farnathi I don't mind skipping all the sex scenes if that's the case.
@anqqi_ Oh, you're live-tweeting. Didn't realize. Have fun, then. :D

@Farnathi If you ever find fics that are the antithesis of this one, link me. :D
@Farnathi *cringes* I'll probably not read it then. Thanks for the heads up. I can deal more with bottom!Dean than super alpha!Cas. Bleh.
AHEM...but what if that bee had never cockblocked Mulder?

I present: 

THE OUTTAKE @ 1:40

You're welcome, @anqqi_
@anqqi_ If you see the scene in slow motion, you will note their lips actually DO touch. So it was like..SO. DAMN. CLOSE. lol
I don't even know... 
"@anqqi_ Ok now i've seen it all. A cockblocking bee. #XFiles"

The universal response to FTF.
@juliajoy8 Instant goddess with the right lip gloss. and/or red lipstick. :D
@Farnathi If it's not a problem, yes, thank you. &lt;333
Every fucking time Mulder breaks into a military base, I swear Scully is so turned on. lol #RedAndTheBlack #YouRebel
LIke, blah, blah, blah, we're mortal enemies, now kiss! 
I just love how intense that scene is, and then after Mulder &amp; Krycek are 10000% riled up, Krycek leans in and kisses him.
Watching #TheRedAndTheBlack again, because I fucking love his episode. Anyway, came for the #MSR, stayed for the Krycek/Mulder slash. :D
Then at the end: "I may not have the X-Files, Scully, but I still have my work." WAIT FOR IT... "And I’ve still got you." YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH.
But you'd never known it from the scenes with him and his little recorder. He's so adorable when he's missing her. &lt;3
He's making these little recordings FOR her about HER. lol And she's hasn't been taken away, mind you, rather re-assigned. lmao.
#LRT: Oh my god, #LittleGreenMen is the best. Mulder being all dramatic about how they've taken Scully away from him.
The answer? Both. Pretty equally. :D
Which ship has the most problems with personal space....
Which ship has the most eye sex...
Shippers can argue about which ship is more slow burn.
I can't wait for ship polls where the final rounds end up with Mulder/Scully v. Dean/Castiel. Like, can that happen already? #shipwars
Let's face it. Mulder needed the friendships. lol
The one thing TXF didn't have enough time to do was solidify the friendship between Mulder and Doggett/Reyes, which I found rather sad.
@juliajoy8 Add cute hair... 5 to 7. Add lipgloss 10++++  (i have a thing for lip gloss)
@sillygoose1013 But for some reason I hadn't watched S7-9 very many times, so most of it felt new to me.
@sillygoose1013 Yeah, I've seen like S1-6 gag reels a million times because I had them on tape since..well they aired YEARS back.
@Farnathi maybe you can tell me what parts have bottom!dean so I can avoid them when I read it later! 
Kudos to Mulder telling Doggett to bend over so he could show him how to use the cream on his fingers, though. *laughs* #GagReels #TXF #S9
I mean, En Ami, was already traumatic enough. "How do you take your coffee?" "Unadulterated, thank you" The gag reel = salt to the wound.
*laughs at self* *resumes life*
Rewatching the TXF gag reels S1-9 and FTF was all fun and games until Scully asked CSM, "Do you want a blow job." And he said, "YES."
mulder: will you just marry me already
Scully: "Amazing!"
Mulder: "The Great Muldeeni." 
somehow i ended up in the cockles tag...
this looks so real... 
Meh. It has Benny. Not a favorite character of mine. Probably save it for later.
lmao, and I was still going to read it, and then, "But for those of you who care, this fic will probably be primarily Bottom!Dean." FUCK ME.
much prettier cat. perfect amount of wrath too. #excellent #switchinggifs
SO CLOSE.... fic said #bottomCas and I was celebrating then my eyes read #bottomDean. 
...that is one ugly cat...
meta's all fun and games until... 

@DubiousCA @StarMinion So literally their argument was: The existence of Destiel is by itself hate for Sam, because it excludes him.
@DubiousCA @StarMinion @destiew_txt LIKE. Wait, a Destiel gif set...about Dean and Cas? Oh my god. When will the Destiel hate for Sam end??!
@DubiousCA @StarMinion @destiew_txt When I asked for Sam hate, two seasons ago, I was shown gif sets of Destiel fans leaving Sam out.
Also, Hannah now being in a male vessel. 

So many subtle FUCK YOU moments to all these tired arguments related to gender and sexuality.
The irony is that the line is so meta, that the people who refuse to acknowledge any subtext (hence hate meta analysis) won't understand it.
Exact reaction to that line: 
Those moments where you KNOW, the writers are actually talking AT the fandom. Or, I should say, PARTS of the fandom. 
@StarMinion @destiew_txt I found anti-Jared, anti-Sam tags on my own and they are pretty barren.
@StarMinion @destiew_txt I mean, they are both so hated. So, like where do you see it all? I keep asking and no one knows.
@StarMinion @destiew_txt Proof of hate is instant and goes back for YEARS. I have no idea where such places exist for Jared/Sam hate.
@StarMinion @destiew_txt ITA. Everyone gets some hate. But if you ask me to show you Destiel hate, I can send you to #Destiew or SPN Goss.

1. have a bikini
2. have a body
3. put on the bikini 
@StarMinion @destiew_txt Can someone please direct me to a place where I can see all this "Jared and Sam" hate?
@andrewdabb OT: Are you ever going to change your twitter icon? I'd love to see YOU. ;-)
All the fanart devoted to @andrewdabb's line about Castiel seeing in colors makes me so happy. You don't even know. #asdfghjkhgfdsadfgdfghjk
/ rambling #soexcited #probablybecausethisismyfirstdcbb
Not to edit them - although, yeah, I do that, too - but just to read them. I forgot creative writing was this much fun. I'm like obsessed.
I am selfishly adding EVERYTHING I love reading to my DCBB fanfic. LIKE EVERYTHING. And I keep going back to re-read my chapters, too.
@anqqi_ Once you watch "Fight the Future," there is also a gag reel for the movie that has a great MSR "improv" moment by David &amp; Gillian.
@juliajoy8 Aww... *hugs* You keep me updated. Let me know when you finally meet Reyes. :)
When you come across Joffreys in the Mulder/Scully tag. I feel dirty.
*Scully spends half the episode on the phone with him*
Mulder: Aliens!!!
Scully: No.

This is the show. :D #TXF 
"@juliajoy8  it really finalized and solidified their partnership really beautifully" Agreed. :)
@jarpadsface follow me to DM? :)
This is so fucking precious I cannot even 
Not only do the tips of my fingers hurt (because I have long nails right now), but my wrists are BURNING. That's how long I've been typing.
You know what I hate? When your mind is totally ready and able to keep on working, but your freaking hands are just done. #typing #writing
She's probably convinced that Sam is Collette and Jared doesn't know what he's talking about. :D RT @Destiheller But... it *is* Cas's body.
Typing until my fingers hurt. 7k+ down for #DCBB in the last 2 days. :D
@JoAnne_Hankey @Destiheller *bites tongue on further commenting* I was about to get vicious. =P
@Destiheller @JoAnne_Hankey 
@Destiheller @JoAnne_Hankey I can't take J2B seriously. I imagine her as a monkey just slamming her fists on the keyboard.
#NowPlaying: The Hills Have Eyes (Unrated)

LET'S DO THIS!
"Oh, it's there. You just aren't considerate enough to tag it."
*cuba gooding voice" Alright. Show me! Shooooow meeee the hate.
*crickets*
What universal willpower we all must have! =P
Someone explain how "every destiel shipper hates Sam" yet we don't actually, you know, produce any actual hate about him.
SO GET THIS! Sam is "the most hated" character in SPN. Yet the anti-Sam tag has 20 posts and half are NOT about Sam or hateful at all. LOL
#Overheard: "I'm so polite. I keep all my hate in the hate tags." - Destiewers 
@exorcisingemily You need to cp those tweets onto a tumblr post so I can reblog.
@tehjessicarae She's so irrelevant though. I'm going to label her as suffering from some form of OCD and just ignore her, per usual. :D
"How the hell did you do that???" This feels so in character. :D 
@tehjessicarae * there should have been a comma after 'why'
Why do I own two DVD copies of #LetMeIn? 
I don't even like the American version of this movie.
What I'm trying to say is, I want another TXF gag reel.
GA alone: "Fuck me." "I want to suck your cock" "Blow me"
Her kneeling down in front of DD simulating a blow job.
Most of this is S1-3 too!
SPN fans think our gag reels are dirty, but have you seen TXF gag reels???
@Destiheller @JoAnne_Hankey Or how Dean/Cas = necrophilia but not Hanstiel/Megstiel. Conveniently, Dean has died 987658x but his body is ok?
@JoAnne_Hankey They are so transparent.
@JoAnne_Hankey And I mean that specifically of people who hate Castiel yet find all these one-off relationships to be so "perfect" for him.
I bet if female!Hannah had returned, ya'll be crying out how "canon" it is and how the writers need to make Hannah stay, amirite?
Topsy shows 5 whole tweets for #Hanstiel this week. 
Where did all the shippers go?
I wonder if those fans who hate Cas but conveniently ship him with every female were excited about the #Hanstiel in 10x17. ;-)
@Destiheller @zatnikatel ty!
Trying to map out my #DCBB on Scrivener right now, but my mind is splitting my story in two, and I can't decide on which direction I prefer.
@StarMinion @charliescastiel Awesome. (PS: half asleep, hence the inability to follow this very simple conversation).
@StarMinion @charliescastiel Is Cas in 10x21?
@StarMinion @charliescastiel Oh, I thought since they are filming the finale now and she was on her way that it was for that. Bummer.
@charliescastiel @StarMinion First time she won't be written by Robbie Thompson too. Though I love Carver so she's in good hands.
@charliescastiel @StarMinion OH AWESOME! OH MY GOD SO CHARLIE IS IN THE SEASON FINALE? THAT IS MAJOR!
@StarMinion Wow. Thank you. (and daaaamn...the long wait...)
@charliescastiel @StarMinion Like he could have been talking about 10x18.But, heck, if we get Charlie again. I'll be so excited! :D
@charliescastiel @StarMinion Was the Charlie spoiler for 10x21 confirmed? Because I saw a quote about it, but it seems a bit vague.
@StarMinion Oh, so 10x18 isn't called Angel Heart? Which # is Angel Heart??
@clusterjams @SuperWhoDawn Where are you getting this info that Charlie will be back again?
@Destiheller Raise their hopes, then dash 'em with Cockles. It's the only way to go. =P
@Destiheller Have at least one of the socks tweet it in link format, asking "Have you seen this super hot J2 photo-op from this weekend?"
@feliciaday now imagine that you've gone your whole life with uneven hair.
But, you know, if you really want to be called Metadouches, I think we an manage, gif-wise. 
Do the trolls (aka Joffreys) want a name change? Joffs fits you all perfectly. Plus, we have this awesome gif of you: 
Why is he ~so attractive, though. Why??? *frustrated whine* 
Morgan and Penelope are having an argument! This kind of angst is my jam! #CriminalMinds #Marathon
@exorcisingemily Forwarding through scenes, yeah, that must be it.
@exorcisingemily This isn't new, though, so why are they suddenly being smug now?
@meghaner SPN's biggest douchebag talks like fandom's biggest douchebags. Yeah, I can see how that'd be a compliment. 
@divinepigeon rotlmao. okay, that alone makes the episode 10000x better.
@anqqi_  *grabs boxset* *purrs*  Which one did you buy, btw? The box, the archive, or the briefcase? :D
@juliajoy8 Amazon has it FREE with prime membership. You can get a free prime trial for 30 days: (cont) 
@anqqi_ So most just go straight to S6 and miss the movie in between which is relevant to the plot, plus you know tons of Mulder/Scully. =P
@anqqi_  *sighs in relief* Awesome. Because if you're watching on Netflix, it doesn't prompt you to watch the movie after S5 finale.
@juliajoy8 Let you know tomorrow!
@juliajoy8 I'll check if it's on Amazon prime for FREE (it may be, hopefully the 2nd movie too), if not i can send you free links.
@juliajoy8 appreciated it as much. Its up to you. DIdn't mean to sound alarmist, lol, it can wait. ;-)
@juliajoy8 Well, maybe go to bed and then watch it tomorrow?? It is a movie, so about 2 hours in length. Plus if you're sleepy you may not
@juliajoy8 But anyway, I believe TXF was one of the few (if not only) shows that actually THRIVED in Friday. It eventually aired on Sunday.
@juliajoy8 aka, that is the night where you send shows to die. Very few shows make it out alive (SPN is one though CWratings are low in gen)
@juliajoy8 Definite high ratings even more so considering it started on Friday nights, which is notoriously known as the death slot for TV.
@juliajoy8 The movie should be watched right after season 5. It leads into season 6. Though the movie was made so anyone could enjoy it.
@juliajoy8 Drop everything and watch it now. The bright side: You will get some MSR that will totally make you feel better about S8/S9.
@anqqi_ Please tell me you watched the first X-Files movie "Fight the Future" right after season 5.
@juliajoy8 (Then S9 is gonna send you to hell, but you can honestly skip that...)
@juliajoy8 I promise. Season 8 is gonna make you want to die, then raise your spirit to heaven and go, "You're welcome."
@juliajoy8 Not "VERY LITTLE" ... URGH... I can't say. But the BEST MSR is YET to come. I just don't want to spoil you.
@juliajoy8 15-29* million
@juliajoy8 Ratings wise their top eps had like 15-20 million. By season 9 it was like 7-9 million. So, the ratings did drop through the yrs.
@juliajoy8 FIGHT THE FUTURE.  (first movie)
@juliajoy8 YOU DIDN'T SEE THE FIRST MOVIE. WAIT. WAIT. WHAT?
@juliajoy8 fans hate it. Even, I myself, am not a fan, and that is saying something. The season 9 finale though: MSR heaven. :D
@juliajoy8 But that isn't the worst part of season 9. The season really screws up what season 8 builds for Mulder/Scully which is why most
@juliajoy8 IMO, Season 8 finale is THE finale of the series. Season 9 reads more like a spin-off series. Even Gillian's role is limited.
@juliajoy8 Although I'm personally not a fan of IWTB, though I did enjoy the MSR, just the plotline was...meh, you'll see when you get there
@juliajoy8 Then in 2008, of course, he and Gillian filmed "I Want To Believe" which was the 2nd movie, and that was Mulder/Scully-centric.
@juliajoy8 I believe he appears in 12 episodes in season 8. One in season 9, though he last like 2-3 "cameo" (blink, you miss it) in S9.
Actual reaction to @juliajoy8 saying she already likes Doggett 
@juliajoy8 year and just wanted a break. I think a lot of actors feel like that when their shows break the 5 year mark. They get restless.
@juliajoy8 hence why starting S6, the show looks a bit...sunnier. But even then, I think he was still just tired of filming 22+ episodes per
@juliajoy8 was newly married and had a family and he was tired of going back and forth. They eventually moved TXF back to LA to shoot there
@juliajoy8 I really can't recall the FULL story, but since S5 he was 'tired' especially because TXF filmed in Vancouver and he was from CA
@juliajoy8 (thought a lot of viewers hated him and NEVER gave him a chance)
@juliajoy8 bit like that so viewers could vent, properly hate him, before giving him a chance later on.
@juliajoy8 And I really love Dogggett, although in 8x01/8x02, you're really supposed to not care for him as much. IMO, writers wrote him a
@juliajoy8 David Duchovny left the series at the end of season 7, so season 8 is Mulder!lite. With that said, stay tuned. ;-)
You're already at #Requiem??? asdfghjhgfdsdfghjkhgfdsfghjkjhgfdsdfghj  RT @juliajoy8  *dies a premature death* 
I need this on an X-Files shirt. RT @juliajoy8 seriously the slowest burn to ever burn slowly
@juliajoy8 Mulder/Scully Romance. The show aired before portmanteaus where popular in pop culture.
I'm just saying... @DavidDuchovny 
Scully (to Mulder): You know what? Maybe you ARE a member of the Manson family.

And now @DavidDuchovny is starring in Aquarius about Manson
@juliajoy8 MSR = Literally slow burn
@juliajoy8 I worship their small, subtle, intimate moments over anything else. &lt;3
@juliajoy8 OH MY GOD. YOU SO GET IT.
Let's see if reverse psychology works. :D
.@mishacollins Whatever you do today, do NOT post a video of you kissing @jensenackles. Do not. #AprilFools #ThingsNotToDo
@Destiheller @StarMinion You can hardly see Misha's face. Probably why...
@Lyda_Scott And, of course, with the new season, it wasn't even 2 days before I saw someone wanting to retcon their entire romantic rel'ship
@Lyda_Scott Wow. Though I do know of fans who debated their relationship even after IWTB, especially if they were "truly" together.
@JJ9828 It's the truth. It's like they cloned you. :D
@Lyda_Scott You know, though, I'd take something like All Things for Dean/Cas any day. Can you imagine that? UGH. I need it.
@Lyda_Scott Even during season 8, I remember all the back and forth about how Scully conceived.
@Lyda_Scott YEEEEES! I remember those debates, too. It was so obvious to a lot of us but it was still to vague for non-shippers.
Yeah, @JJ9828 still looks like a carbon copy of Julie Andrews to me. #stunning 
@JJ9828 @themixedone So all around ray of sunshine, then. #asshat
@JJ9828 Is this a Supernatural troll (or just a randomm troll)?
Has anyone been tricked by some kind of April Fool's joke yet? 

*ventures carefully into tumblr*
The importance of my username after you watch TXF's #AllThings, though. 
I'm just here like... 
@juliajoy8 They just look SO happy at the end. (probs because they both recently got laid after god knows how long!!) 
SO IMPORTANT RT @juliajoy8  bUT CASUAL HAND HOLDING <DIZZY FACE>
"@juliajoy8 HOW COULD THEY JUST LEAVE IT LIKE THAT [...] HOW DID IT HAPPEN WHO STARTED IT WHY DID SHE LEAVE WJSKFKJD" 
"@juliajoy8  WOW THOUGH WHAT AN IMPORTANT EPISODE" 
"@juliajoy8 ????? Did they just ????? WHAT" 
*heavy breathing* RT @juliajoy8  JUST STARTED ALL THINGS HOLD UPPPPP
@juliajoy8 lmao. so damn creepy especially if you think about it the context of him being her father-in-law. Ew. *shudders* Also, he's old.
@RemindMeBot Thank you.
Pretty much Mulder's reaction any time Scully goes missing or he can't find her: 
LANGLY: She's gone to great lengths to keep this from you.
MULDER: I don't believe that. She knows I'd find her no matter what.
@juliajoy8
@juliajoy8 Love the escalating tension, with Mulder growing more and more worried, as she continues to evade him. He gets so desperate. =P
@juliajoy8 mmm... dat dress...and the scene where she's hiding a mic in her bra. haha. all enjoyable "unadulterated" moments. ;-)
@StarMinion Meh. I doubt they have much to gloat about. Misha is front and center, and J2M is evenly spaced; Js aren't "together" so...
@juliajoy8 Comparatively short, that is. I had to wait from 2002-2015. lol
@juliajoy8 And the best thing is that you'll be done and then have a pretty short time before the new season starts. lol
@rabalaskas I'm kind of peeved they put that in the gag reel, TBH. But, yeah, Jensen also apologized about his prank. JA = super decent guy.
@rabalaskas And it's really just NOT being a shitty person. Like, I'm not a huge Misha fan, but when I saw that I was like, that is wrong.
@juliajoy8 
Wow. Jensen is NOT amused by how hard Jared hit Misha w/ the pie in the face. 
Do people connected to the show seem MORE excited than usual, or is that just a vibe I'm projecting b/c ~I'm MORE excited than usual? #SPN
@StarMinion Ah, okay. Ignore my DM.
@StarMinion DM
@StarMinion Oh, really? Who said that? #secretset
#BatesMotel is so fucking angsty this season.
@StarMinion Angel also tells Wes if something goes wrong, to kill him. And the spell/hypnotism is to extract his soul. Lots of parallels.
Heh. So basically dark!Willow/Sam and Angelus/Dean on S10? (based on spec, anyway). Now that would be awesome. :D
@StarMinion @meghaner Basically, they trick Angel into thinking he's had a moment of true happiness and then when he awakens, voila, ANGELUS
@StarMinion @meghaner This actually reminds me of how Angelus is brought back on ATS. He emerges due to a dream. @rthompson1138
@rthompson1138 @fangirlingjess @Mark_Sheppard Everyone dies, and from the ashes, destiel is born.
"Losing My Religion" by R.E.M...please tell me there are like a billion Destiel videos to this song. If not, fandom, you have let me down.
Now THAT would be awesome. RT @VerronicaaC @TheOrlandoJones make a cameo on The X-Files or something.
They've started early! #aprilfools #fakedestielnews 
"@TheOrlandoJones Stay tuned" Thank you. :)
So THAT just happened. Set up a reminder via a twitter bot. Nice! 
@RemindMeBot 8:00 AM
FYI: Tomorrow is April Fools. Someone remind me as soon as you see me tweeting. I do NOT want to get fooled by fake destiel news. *sobs*
@TheOrlandoJones You'd tell us if you were going to guest star on Supernatural this season, right? *squinty eyes*
@StarMinion You're welcome. Love that he's planning to shoot a video of the cast photo. I was literally wanting that when Jim mentioned it.

("Damn it, Misha, you had one job. Let fans get riled up for PR.") Jim Michaels, probably...
Jim Michaels: So, Misha may not be in the finale. Haha. Panic now.
Misha Collins: Hey guys here I am filming the finale. Watch me. Watch me.
Trying to find a conversation from last year among 2080 tumblr messages in my inbox. Yeah, that's NOT gonna happen. SIGH.
@adamwvfx lmao. I believe she's on tumblr. Let me see if I can find her link...
@adamwvfx Because some of us are really lazy. lol And sometimes you don't have enough characters, anyway.
@adamwvfx  "Dean and Castiel" is shortened to "Dean/Cas" which is shortened to "Destiel" which is shortened to "D/C".  =P
@AUMagic @adamwvfx Oops. I didn't see someone rec'ed the video already. I guess it's everyone's favorite D/C fansong. :D
@adamwvfx 
And this one is more musical-y (a bit cheesy), but god do I listen to it 1000x times. lol  
@adamwvfx My favorite D/C songs:
Plead the Fifth: 
Hey There Castiel: 
@adamwvfx I've been listening to fansongs all week! Thank you for sharing this one. I actually hadn't listened to it!


Everything is @feliciaday and Castiel in @rthompson1138's episode and EVERYTHING HURTS because I'm afraid Charlie &amp; Cas won't meet. *SOBS*
@juliajoy8 (And I do count 7x04 as their first kiss, even if Mulder stole one from Scully in 6x03).
@juliajoy8 stereotypical "relationship" milestones as friends. Whether it's sharing a kiss or professing their love for one another.
@juliajoy8 Heh. Well what I love about that is that the love declaration was, IMO, platonic. And I love that they reach most of the
SCULLY: Is this what it takes to climb the ladder
COLTON: All the way to the top
SCULLY: Then I can't wait til u fall off &amp; land on your ass
COLTON: You said Mulder was out there. That guy's insane.

Asshole. So say we all. =P
Someone who is a great agent and someone who wants the same things he wants. He's not just going to let her go. AHHH. So good! :)
And Scully calls him on out. "You're being territorial." And Mulder admits it! He is because he's found someone who respects him.
And god bless Mulder. He is totally acting out. Exaggerating a lot of his thoughts on aliens, wanting to keep Scully all for himself.
But Scully is pretty firm in saying, "No, I'm assigned to the X-Files and Mulder's my partner" and she doesn't budge at all. Total hero. :D
She's actually being pressured to do so. People don't like Mulder. He's strange. His theories are out there. "Get out while you still can."
Or, really, more like Scully choosing Mulder. She literally has the opportunity to work with other agents, and not include Mulder.
Squeeze is one of my favorite #MSR episodes because it's the first time we see Mulder and Scully really choosing each other.
@juliajoy8 And that was waaaaaaaaaay back in season 1. lol
@juliajoy8 Mulder is the first person to say I love you. Though, Scully was the first person to say, "I'd put it all on the line for you."
@juliajoy8 Yes, that's something I've always loved. How open Mulder is with his emotions, and how honestly he always expresses himself.
SCULLY: They feel your methods, your theories are...
MULDER: Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky? 
SCULLY: It probably has to do with your reputation.
MULDER: Reputation? I have a reputation? 
SCULLY: I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.
MULDER: Why would I make them so uncomfortable?
The episode where Mulder has no friends. :( #TXF #Squeeze
Skipped 1x02 to watch 1x03. Great decision. #TXF #ILoveThisEp
Just finished watching #TXF pilot. Here we go again. =P
@juliajoy8 OH. You're so close to "All Things" too. BTW, the ep is not  M/S heavy, at all, it's a Scully standalone. But has a great ending.
He's so in love with her at this point. :D RT @juliajoy8  "you do keep me guessing" ajsjdkdkskskalslfn
I really do want to do DCBB so, I'll probably just juggle two separate stories.

"She was my gay thing." If Dana Scully was Dean Winchester... #femslash 
@anon_unknown001 @tehjessicarae And when fans complain that Jared grabs Misha's crotch, the response is: Misha brings it on himself.
@anon_unknown001 @tehjessicarae  They truly go overboard. I still remember how the S8 gag reel ended with claims that Misha was a rapist.
Mulder and Scully reaching out to one another. I love how Scully doesn't even open her eyes; they are so like-minded. 
#Overheard: This woman is bisexual. :) 
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel I worry about losing my parents all the time, too...
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel (but thankfully after living a LONG life). So I have NO grandparents, and haven't for a several years...
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel And my dad, well his dad was killed in his front yard when he was just 4. And his mom died a few years ago
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel She's the baby of the family and my grandparents had her when they were middle age, so...
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel Literally my mom. She's only 50 right now and lost her father (late 30s) and mother (late 40s) pretty young.
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel Very sorry to hear that! My grandmother also passed away so I completely understand.
I just feel like we all need to give David a year's notice. Do something or move out of the way. #GillianAnderson #EveryoneLovesHer

I mean, twitter has already copied so much of Tumblr's layout anyway. Might as well make tweets editable.
Damn, I wish Twitter had an edit button because I want to keep a tweet but take off offensive language. @Twitter, something to consider?
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel Anyway, sorry if you thought the cursing was literally directed at either of you. I was just venting. Will delete
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel So it's universal to look at old people and just think, "They don't get it." Same thing happened w/ Paula Deen.
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel I admit I had a racist grandmother, and in the past I remember saying, "She's from another time."
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel I suppose that people see that as a genuine explanation (out of pity or MEDICAL reasons).
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel TBH...every time I search or follow WS's arguments, you see, "He's old." "He's only 84."
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel You're both free to have your POV, but I'm just upset when I feel that certain issues get dismissed so easily.
@tehjessicarae @zatnikatel I actually linked to the tweet I was responding to, and it wasn't yours. However, I said, this is a common excuse
@zatnikatel And I agree that is a possibility and he'd have no blame for that. But if it isn't?
@zatnikatel So, to me, this isn't new and it isn't cute, and it isn't dismissed because in the past he helped with certain racial injustices
@zatnikatel Age shouldnt excuse ignorance. With that said, I've known of WS to be racist before and talked about it when this MC stuff began
@zatnikatel He's 84 and may have cognitive issues =/= He's 84 and doesn't know better. It's the latter I take issue with.
@zatnikatel "He's 84 years old" "He's old"  are the #1 excuses ALL over twitter. It's not directed at one person, but to the idea behind it.
/ vent
Like really? Of course don't send him hate, of course don't cross any lines, but let's stop covering up WS's own bad behavior.
"This is a classic x-file, Scully. Classic." I always love when Mulder says the most absurd things are classic. lol 
.@GillianA: I can love both men and women. 
Me: GODDESS.

@exorcisingemily Wish we could have a happy tag (or trend) today. Especially since we'll see Cas tomorrow.
Yesterday morning: Shit, I'm scared Cas may die and be written off
Yesterday evening: *JM tires to imply MC may not be in the finale*

FUCK.
Pretty much people in desperate need of attention and ego stroking. I hate how easily SPN fans, actors, and PTB give into these rude celebs.
What is it with "has been" celebrities clutching onto the Supernatural fandom to get attention while being complete asshats in the process?
(sorry, I constantly go from very serious thoughts to crack)
THAT would have been hilarious.
But can you imagine if the dialogue had stayed true to the meme and Marie had told Dean, "You can't have subtext without BUTT SEX."
Damn it, Robbie Thompson. You sneaky, sneaky bastard.
"You can't spell subtext without s-e-x."

987634567 years later...

Wait, does this mean D/C must have sex at some point?
(Or already have?)
Legit read that as "bottom!Jensen" and growled. lol #NotThatIReadRPFThatMuch RT @Destiheller I am writing botting!Jensen fic to celebrate.
@HunterHerondale @Zap2it Maybe because he doesn't go around saying "hoe" and is 100% respectful to everyone?
@Zap2it @JensenAckles Glad he won! :)

The 2015 #Zap2Showdown is officially over.

@JensenAckles is the new King of Social Media.
@YorkAshley Right?? It's amazing! Watched it 10x today. lol
I believe the other poll was E!Online so maybe that inspires more fun? I don't know...
Right off the bat the comment section was rather empty, and people online were already throwing low blows at one another. So much tension.
Didn't we have a Jensen/Misha poll the other year and it was all super fun? You could immediately tell this year was different.
Was that top/bottom reference to obvious? Or just vague enough to be overlooked. lol #shameless
Congrats to @JensenAckles voters. Over one million votes to crown him #1. Like, Dean, Jensen's always on top. ;-) 
We're in a constant state of fear/pain/paranoia. Ah, to be a shipper.
BAD things happen to Destiel on SPN: TPTB are trying to fuck us up!
GOOD things happen to Destiel on SPN: TPTB are trying to fuck u up!

:)
@GreensieBeans Hey, sent you a DM. ;)
Whoa. My entire timeline is filled with "VOTE MISHA!!!" tweets. lol What happened?
@andrewdabb Excited for your episode this week. (Is that a Kafka, Metamorphosis reference in the ext. promo? Ugh, didn't need those feels!)
@rthompson1138 Sorry for rambling. I just REALLY love this episode.  (OH! And the 2 X-Files references. LOOOOOOOOOVED THEM). #iwanttobelieve
@rthompson1138 Plus the girls playing Dean &amp; Cas being in a relationship is ~still the best thing ever. And Dean/Sam being awesome as usual.
@rthompson1138 The songs were beautiful wonderful. "I'll just wait here" even MORE romantic this time around. Kristen was adorable! &lt;3
@rthompson1138 Loved everything about it, the writing (so clever, witty, and creative) and especially the casting. Lovely girls all around!
@rthompson1138 The scene where Marie kills the scarecrow and it perfectly combines with Sam killing Calliope was so powerful, too.
@rthompson1138 From "You never should have thrown this away" to Dean putting the Samulet on the mirror. 
@rthompson1138 Just rewatched "Fanfiction" and still it's my favorite episode this season. Cried through the entire final 5 minutes.
@VeinotteValerie Agreed;
And bonus:

Mulder sleeps with someone who is NOT Scully: Meh. *shrugs*
Dean sleeps with someone who is NOT Cas: Meh. *shrugs*
Why do I ship things so differently. I'm very territorial over Cas. :D #TLDR
Scully sleeps with person who is NOT Mulder:
YEAAAAHH! BRING IT.

Castiel sleeps with person who is NOT Dean: 
OH, FUCK NO. HOLD MY FLOWER.
@exorcisingemily Oh, I'm really sorry honey. My thoughts are still with you, your mom, and your family. *hugs*
Talking to my girlfriend and her friend about TXF and Mulder/Scully. 
A rant may follow. lol #personal #relationships #diferentPOVs #ships
That ENTIRE video though... #LT 
everything changes | x-files { mulder &amp; scully }: 
@exorcisingemily Sorry to hear that! Sending good thoughts!
"@anqqi_ aren't we partners in crime already and have been for quite some months now?"  Excellent point. 
WTH happened? lol I did not see to see all that. There was superglue and...it was bad. #Googlefails #AutoCorrect #AutoINcorrect
Typed in "Hamster" on google, it automatically autocorrected it to "xHamster" as I clicked enter, then suddenly: PORN! PORN EVERYWHERE!
Hey, @anqqi_. I see you favoriting my fledgling tweet. Let's be partners in crime in this one! 
@ismat I knew only Scully could adequately convey the feelings about that person. ;-)
@ismat :D
@zzelectric @ismat 
And THAT is the problem. =P  RT @CaitlinCMiller but I'm still grotesquely optimistic about this damn show
@ismat @zzelectric That should eliminate this @ replies. :)
@ismat @zzelectric You block HIM, or select the option to only read mentions from people you follow (if you don't follow him).
#LastTweet: Reminds me...how can I send TPTB subliminal messages about not dropping the nephilim idea and give us a D/C fledgling. *ponders*
punch me in the face 
:D 
@CaitlinCMiller Maybe a part of me thinks, things are way too good (in fandom AND on the show) to be true.
"@CaitlinCMiller well NOW I'M WORRIED" Sorry! I woke up panicked about it. 
"For those of you on the interweb..." I can't stop laughing. This is adorable. 

I want a shirt that says, "You can find me on the interweb"
like wtf is internet? it sound prehistoric so I kept scrolling past it. Now, I finally read it and realized interweb = internet. lol
Kept seeing this con quote on my tumblr dash being reblogged a lot, would read a few words into it, see the word "interweb" &amp; lose interest.
Wait, did Jensen just call the internet "the interweb"... lol
All the feels. 
(and by secret, I mean longterm three year worry shared by pretty much every D/C shipper every season like clockwork) 
So, yeah, what if they give us what we want, but only because we're saying goodbye to Cas. There, that's my secret worry.
It's also the fact that the subtext is getting more blatant. Like Dean's confessional scene?
BUT..I was also around for S7, so excuse me for reliving some of the fear of them killing Cas and trying to write him off. *hyperventilates*
I was pretty secure in, "If they kill him, they will bring him back" and I like the angst of demon!Dean threatening Cas.
Going through SPN tweets in the past 24 hours:

Oh, good. So I'm NOT the only one suddenly worried about Castiel being killed off.
@juliajoy8 (Because Samantha's story is the most convoluted)
@juliajoy8 really have to suspend belief and accept that no ending would have ever really tied up all their previous story arcs.
@juliajoy8 I thought David's execution of the episode was beautiful. I cry everyt ime he says, "I'm free." But to watch this episode you
@juliajoy8 previous versions of the story so they could finally 'neatly' wrap up the storoy and give Mulder some closure.
@juliajoy8 Weird as in it didn't add up at all with any of the canon we have on Samantha? Because, yeah, they essentially retconned all
@juliajoy8 She comforted him all night long. I really can't stand when Mulder is that broken. My fucking heart. :(
"SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR PAIN." RT @juliajoy8 yesss! Ugh that scene with scully where he was crying. <BROKEN HEART><BROKEN HEART> 
@juliajoy8 Argh! That is so unexpected, right? :(
Ah, I see the NHI might be in trouble for JPs Cas/Collette slip up. Hope he doesnt lose his job. Then how will the NHI/NSA romance continue?

That was from tumblr, btw. I read it quite seriously and then just started laughing super hard. "But then why am I queer" is hilarious.
@VeinotteValerie @smileScully_ @GillyannX @LauriceF He just looks so beautiful with it. *gazes at him lovingly*
@smileScully_ @GillyannX @LauriceF This beard looks really soft though, like the softest cutest beard that ever existed. *nods* #itstrue
Guess J2M are less grumpy about manips than fans, as Jared says here, "They are used to it." So they ~do google search. ;-)
D'aww: "Good manip, like photoshop." Re: Jensen about the manip Misha leaked.
@KathrynLNewton Didn't now the cat video idea was yours. Brilliant! Quite literally my favorite "fandon" thing probably in...well, ever. :)

#SeaCon
Jared: the Cas/Colette parallel was…
And in case it wasn't clear: I LOVE EVERYONE AT THIS BAR!! #destiel #spn
LMAO. Destiel fan posted a video crying about the Cas/Collette parallel.
I guess we are freaking out, huh? Who has the beer???
My TL is filled with a lot of "beard!!!" "No beard!" 
I am NOT kidding: 
LOL. Now, why am I not keeping score???? ;-)
RIP to all the mental work it took the bro fans to keep pretending Cas has no value to Dean. You all must be exhausted. Walk it off. :)
Which of course they did. Because that parallel has been obvious for two seasons.
Pretty sure they wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to stop a simple, "Is Cas/Collette intentional" unless they feared they'd say YES.
No wonder someone stalked this teenage girl &amp; tried to prevent her from asking this question. Bro fans really didn't want to face the truth!
@HellWhenIDie @tehjessicarae @fadedwings Neither Dean or Cas will stay dead. Their death would only provide angst which I love. :)
This confirmation wasn't for the Cas fans. We recognized the parallel back in season 8. This was for the brickwalls. TY goss for the term!

"Cas/Collette parellels are intentional" -Jared 
Overhead: Destiewers and Joffreys heads exploding as Jared confirms that the Collette parallel in #Supernatural was meant for Castiel.
Certain toxic parts of the SPN fandom, I hate. But the lovable, dorky, super meta excited people? I fucking love you so much. #fistpump #SPN
#LastRT: What a fucking cutie, that girl. "The parallel was on purpose" and you see this girl literally FIST PUMP at the confirmation. :D
@san_da_lias Bless you. I had the same thought as well.
@anqqi_ Did you watch Quagmire? That's pretty much him meeting his untimely death. *sad face*
@FateOfCastiel The fact that he brought it up at a con and said people in the set mentioned it, means people were talking about it.
@FateOfCastiel Not really an unpopular opinion. I don't think posting the pic was right. As for an apology? Maybe just to JA directly.
@hanko9 @NataliaQuique1 lol these photos aren't from a txf shooting. ;-)
I'm actually laughing tears because someone asked David if they were going to revive QUEEQUEG. Oh my god. *laughs forever* #TXF
@anqqi_ Well, I'm damn impressed. lol Sorry you're being spoiled. I hope you have me muted! :)
@anqqi_ Oh my god. How did she get to S8 so far? Whoa. (is she talking to you about it? Tell her to join twitter) lol
He makes her laugh. She makes him laugh. 

[flirtation intensifies] 
@ismat She's pretty consistent in that episode, even in Mulder's hallucinations. If anyone knows Scully, it's Mulder. :)
"It sounds like crap when you say it." Poor Mulder. =P 
The only thing better? The sass in this exchange: 
LMAO. How can you not love Scully? Also note: This is a REAL conversation from the show. :) 
Friendly reminder that last year (almost to the day), Gillian said there was "more than an attraction" between her &amp; David. You're welcome.
So stunning. 
Um, can this be Mulder's new look? Dat beard! #TXF #DavidDuchovny 
"@nealcharmings @WilliamShatner  Are you being islamophobic?" Transparently, so. But watch him backtrack. This is why I just blocked him.
He's so fucking transparent. BLOCKED! RT @deansmuse @WilliamShatner @nealcharmings you tried to seem oblivious just to be fucking rude
What the actual fuck? Just stop. RT @WilliamShatner @LuckyLuci18  I see a lot of young vitriolic woman with similar hoods. Is it religious?
#LRT: Interesting how JA refers to Dean's body as his vessel.
@ChiaS88 Oh, I love that!
It's interesting, I inspired a few people to watch TXF and their response to the series has in return inspired me to watch it again. LOL
I swear I just finished watching TXF S1-9 and I'm about to start again.
Someone halp! #txf #ijustgetsoexcitedaboutthisshow #mustrewatch
@margarita2083 That would be a clever way to bring up William. I do hope they get him back.
X-Files // inappropriate piece of crack!/song spoof pt3: 
X-Files- Quotes, Tropes, Moose and Squirrel moments, Vol X  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): 
Will Scully and Mulder be FBI in the new season? I actually hope they are.
@spnwriter You're back! :)
@JESSlCAMOORE Two wrongs aren't going to make a right...
@JESSlCAMOORE It was a screw up, and not sure what backlash he's getting for it, but certainly does NOT warrant hate or harassment.
@ishipdeanhappy @mybabydark Everything except his face was from another dude.
The only problem is that I'd probably have to revise SPN 1-10, which...I don't know, for me, SPN is watch it ONCE and move on. lol
Also, I'm not sure if I should make it too elaborate, or if I should just make a bullet point, because it could get rather long...
I might to a TXF v. SPN comparative. The question now is...will it focus exclusively on MSR &amp; Destiel or just in general? Hmmm...
@rabalaskas @meghaner Pretty sure the reason he tweeted it in the first place was because he thought it ~was a real naked pic of Jensen.
@JESSlCAMOORE Pretty sure that's why people are pissed. He tweeted the pic without stating it's a manip, implying Jensen took nude pics.
@ishipdeanhappy @mybabydark It wasn't a real photo of Misha. It was a manip. #fakepic
