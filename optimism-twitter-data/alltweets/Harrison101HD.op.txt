Not a bad race. 6/10. Bonus point for Trolling' Newgarden. #IndyCar
And there's Will Power for the win! In control from start to finish! Another great performance from Graham Rahal in 2nd! #IndyCar
Gotta roll on the hypewagon. A shame, Clare's normally better than that. 
Johnson! *shakes fist* 
@ben_mcphillips *salute*
@BombersportsUK Indeed. Don't poke the idiot.
That LewisNo1Fan woman is either the world's most intelligent troll, or ridiculously stupid. Either way, why mingle with a mongoloid?
Josef Newgarden: Mega troll. It's Lewis Hamilton at Germany 2012 all over again!
GET IN THE CAR YOURSELF BRAH! :P 
@BombersportsUK Meh, it's easy to throw the "armchair fan" talk about, but as long as what you say is fair and valid, it's fine to me.
So I can't criticise a movie unless I make one myself? C'mon people, you're smarter than this. (Death threats are ALWAYS dumb though.)
As long as criticism is fair, I don't see what the problem is. The "can you do better?" logic is flawed. 
@CraigGraham94 Nope, Road course.
TK trying to go full old man on Coletti...and failing. #IndyCar
@NRL_Kubica Stop tweeting me and enjoy the damn race! ;)
Who is this man and what has he done with Graham Rahal? Exceptional stuff. #IndyCar

Phil Jones is at Left Back. ALWAYS THE HARD WAY MANCHESTER.
Luke Shaw is made of spit and Kleenex. FFS.

@jilliancourt You two are getting too old for me, scary I've known you both for nearly 4 years on here!
See Robin, that's how its done.
Oh that picture is brilliant.

What did you make of Formula E? — Meh. Great performance from Sebastian Buemi, controlled the race from start to... 
And I missed it yesterday, but congrats to @xMattyG on reaching 10,000. Long overdue, brilliant work.
Also, you know what time it is Leicester fans - 
Gutsy effort from Burnley all season long. Just didn't have the tools and ran out of gas late on.
Sorry Hull fans!  
@bouncebckbltrx Italian Stallion!
Well, that was meh. Overdue tbh.

@betty_schuller This is when you know shit's bad.
Best #SkyF1 moment this season via sheer channel flicking, Anthony Davidson finally kicking the shit out of the "Sky Pad". #ItsAFuckingTV
Verstappen or Sainz? — They're both great. We should celebrate that.

It's okay Verstappen fans, there's plenty of room. 
@DJMFIFA8 @TheOfficialFNG This is probably true.
No. They just need to swap cars. 
Also, chill capers, over Grenadian overlord will win tomorrow.
Overlooked - FANTASTIC lap from Carlos Sainz for P5 and the home fans. #F1
Pretty clear P3, well played Seb, and well played Sanitary Towel. #F1
GAME ON! They're banker laps, chill.
For those complaining about Jorda getting airtime, we used to have the Fernando Alonso girlfriend drinking game. Relax.
Felipe Massa's last lap was the only thing stopping the ENTIRE Q2 grid from formation flying. #NoahsArk
Toro Rosso ahead of both Red Bulls. Both Red Bulls aint shit either. #F1
@KJ_Ingram_13 Speeds up Quali too. It was complicated at first, but it definitely works.
Only 2 Quali sessions. Fastest 10 in FP1-3 automatically go through to Q2. Everyone else in Q1, fastest 2 join Q2. 
F1 needs to adopt MotoGP's qualifying system. Q1 and 2 are glorified practise sessions now.
Have some respect @CroftyF1, call him by his actual name.
@jmikemac Muller? Good man. *fist bump*
Nico Hulkenberg's 2015 highlight will be Le Mans. 
Force India ain't shit. #F1
Is this the part where Twitter faps itself silly as go McLaren P5 or P6? #F1
MANOR SIGHTING! Drink! #SkyF1
Also, Qualifying is free on Sky1 by the way, if you feel like drilling your eyeballs in.
On Skype, I am now the official provider of alternative F1 commentary.
@Gmullen2810 Sounds like a plan!
@Amlin_Aguri "Amlin Aguri celebrate Da Costa's car being named 'rear of the year'"
SHIT, Webber's here! Take him Porsche, he's the grim reaper! #F1
@Gmullen2810 I love you really Mullen, its nothing personal. ;)
@RyanErikKing I would say, wipe the sweat from your forehead and relax, but I think he has that covered. ;)

@beck_j93 :)
@beck_j93 You're the one that dropped my name in it! :P
@lharrisonx :) 
*blows kisses* ;) 
Sebastian Buemi on pole for Monaco! Lucas Di Grassi joins him on the front row. #FormulaE
@LouisSuddaby23 @beck_j93 You both are crazy.
Totes. Awks. 
Nelson Piquet justifiably pissed that Lucas blocked him!
@RyanErikKing Of course!
My brother, I didn't stop trading that shit till I was 16. Especially after the Movie came out. 
Yu-Gi-Oh Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix is life, and love.
@monsieurbenz Read this tweet back to yourself, the irony is hilarious. ;)
@RoshyWalsh Sup babe?
Despite this sore throat and cold being a bastard, I'm feeling really good right now. :)
Yep! Seriously, thank you guys so much. &lt;3 
@RachaelKrishna Fucking wow.
5 years of University fun - And a wonderful moment getting to host Blast Radio's season finale.…

I swear to God, the Jags are cursed, get them away from London!
Are you kidding me?!

P3. As per. 
Do you think Ferrari will sign Raikkonen for next Season, ... — Yes. Don't see any reason he'd need to be replaced. 
@MasterSwiiift Yeah, mine too. The best bit of braking I've ever seen.
Any excuse to post this one as well by the way - RIP Gilles. 
Also, Bex replicated my Argentina weekend by correctly guessing 2 out of 3. We're all going to know about it at 8. So, you'd better listen.
That's right, #BikeLive in just 30 minutes. Reviews of BSB and MotoGP in Spain, as well as the dirtiest move I've EVER seen on 2 wheels.
@Alex__Butcher I deferred and change course after 2 years of being an average Business student.
And just like that, 5 years of me at University has come to an end. It's been quite a ride. Onto the next chapter.
@CraigGraham94 Oh ha, ha!
Lotus running out of money, Sidepod held together via spit and Kleenex.
Double welp.  
Danny Ric on his final engine already. Welp.
Also, I got Netflix for another free month. I can watch episodes of "The Thick of It" to make myself feel better.
Another assignment done. 2 down, another finishing today, just 2 left.
Leaving for Uni in the next half hour or so, still waiting for the sky to turn red and the 4 horsemen to rain down.
@sherbearx @ChukaUmunna Co-sign!
World class reference Sinhaman. 
Brilliant resignation speech by Miliband. Smiled warmly at the Milifandom line too. Well done Ed, gutsy effort.
@lucyefcf1 Yep, probably high 5'ing Rupert Murdoch on Skype. Scotland and the pollsters have been played like a fife.
Hey, John Carver, it's not too late - Might as well join these party leaders right?
And they're dropping like flies, Miliband resigns. What a friggin' Freek Tragedy.
Reports in Italy that Barcelona have big £68m for Pogba and it got rejected, haha.
Stoffel should already be in F1. I already think on paper he's as good as half the field. 
McLaren FP1 and GP2 FP1 almost identical. The real difference? £150m in development. That's alarming.
Clegg gone too. Nice guy, genuinely think he came across very well on The Last Leg. Shame about that whole coalition thing.
Do you think that UKIP should have more seats than th... — Yep. The "First Past the post" system is fundamentall... 
@DannyBrennan72 But they have live updates planned, so they'll catch up quickly enough.
Still funny. 
Nigel Farage, the skidmark we all wish we could forget of British politics. Don't let the pint glass hit you on the way out.
@LouisSuddaby23 SHIT! KILL IT WITH FIRE!
@Noble_2909 How does it handle? Heard a lot of negative reports on the Formula A cars specifically!
Should have shot myself for ever thinking being a business student was a good idea!  
At least heading in for my final day of Uni today ought to cheer me up no end. Not much against it, but 5 years is enough for any mortal.
This wasn't on you Ed. Not even close. Good luck in the future.  
Wow, Farage is out. The Internet gets its consolation prize.
@tara_smiles Consider it done. <WINKING FACE>
So, when's the first flight to Kingston...
@Steph_Lowexo Happy Birthday sweetheart! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Those early exit polls were actually ironically, conservative in nature. Fuck.
@AmyyTheEngineer Thanks redhead. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
At least Ed Balls has more time to tweet his own name.
@lucyefcf1 Yeah, I can only imagine. :/
@lucyefcf1 We. Are. Fucked.
300 up for the Tories. Oh boy.
*wakes up* Shit.
Why has it taken me so long to Subscribe to Jim Sterling on YouTube? Dude's fantastic.
SNP: "When Scotland is...ashes, then you have my permission to die"
#TheDarkKnightRise…
@DanNerdCubed Thanks for being brilliant tonight. You are the man Dan.
@SeanRossSapp @DeAIID @Rhiannamator Word. I see the same people report from their live shows and tapings EVERY time.
@jmikemac Yeah, giving Westminster the metaphorical fist. Labour's doomed regardless.
@jmikemac Man, if I knew that, I'd have an amazing career in politics.
I'm sticking a red flag outside their KFC in Ealing Broadway tomorrow. 
@jmikemac I suspect he and many others have underestimated Scotland. Massive turnout, seats stolen, shooting down a coalition on live TV.
Yep, Ed's fucked this one right up. The #SNP are going to squeezes his political cojones.
@CraigGraham94 I'm purely on the Internet still!
@MasterSwiiift *Marge Simpson groan*
So, we embraced David Cameron as our overlord again yet, or nah?
@Velocita_ If Douglas Alexander went down, the whole thing's gonna go tits up. This is the SNP saying: "Fuck you Westminster!"
I'm using The Guardian's tracker, Scotland is turning yellow like a fucking "Paint by Numbers" set. It's could be a 1-party state.
Congrats to my man @CraigGraham94's Dundee West, an SNP win from Labour.
@RyanErikKing They're getting 50+, I'm almost darn sure of that.
That seat Black won, was a Labour seat since the end of WW2?! The red side is DOOMED in Scotland.
And props to Scotland, MUCH better turnout than the rest of the UK. Mid 70's.
@CraigGraham94 And now, my 22 year old ass feels old as hell.
Wow, Mhairi Black, MP at 20. Good for her.
Only just got offline from 6 straight hours of Skype calls. Not the best idea with a sore throat.
Start the train, the SNP are coming.
THE DUP ARE OFF THE BOARD! It's Infamous: Second Son all over again!
@GB32_ Close enough!
Man, @DanNerdCubed is pretty much providing all my entertainment tonight.
GERMANY! 
Because where would be if we had no rules? FRANCE! 
@GB32_ National Cannabis Alliance?
What's even scarier - A third of the country straight up didn't vote.
Green out-voting Lib Dems 4/4 so far. Dear God.
@TheRainMeister1 Sunderland are too busy preparing for relegation.

@GameRiotArmy DAMN STRAIGHT!

@CraigGraham94 Expected at 2:30am!
@nata_117 My old friend is all grown up. &lt;3
@CraigGraham94 What's yours mate?
When the sample size is so low, it's impossible to put any kind of confidence in it. 
Ealing North - Expected time: 5:30am. Me and Steve Pound go way back. 
@MasterSwiiift This is also true.
Go to bed people, bulk of results are not going to be a thing till about 3-4am.
@tara_smiles Gonna spend the rest of the night being cheeky and flirty? I need cheering up! ;)
@RachaelKrishna Rachael "Hypnotoad" Krishna
@RachaelKrishna Slow night for you huh? ;)
@VivaMattyVegas No probs!
@VivaMattyVegas Wouldn't go as far as to say a week, but its unlikely it'll be tonight.
@VivaMattyVegas Seats on the government and some legislation. Gotta be negotiated obviously.
@VivaMattyVegas One of the major parties will create a government with a handful of minor parties.
@VivaMattyVegas Pretty much. It looks like it's going to be another coalition.
WHERE'S THE LIB DEMS GOING?!  
3-0, Tories are getting treated like Jerome Boateng's ankles. :P
@tara_smiles I tell it how it is! :D :*

@CraigGraham94 Deal!
Can we end this Election now?
#HistoricalPayments 
Latest exit poll - Manor with 327 seats, they now rule the country. Because fans.
@j_hussain BBC, this isn't a debate.
If you want a potentially more accurate poll, the respected FiveThirtyEight has their own here. 
Is my maths right? 58 out of 59 Scottish seats for the SNP? Miliband's gonna be licking Nicola's heels.
@shaungrant13 You and me both.
Christ, Tories with 316 on the exit poles? Does this mean Stone Cold is a part of the team?!
Give or take a 25% margin of error. 
@AeternoUK Yep, 2013 is the most complete Codies F1 game of the set, and it's not even close.

@ZaraZahid It's an app where you can live stream via your iPhone camera.
Sounds like a bad porno! 
John Carver - Mega troll. 
@Velocita_ Wouldn't surprise me. There's no way they can be working on their 2016 car already.
@Velocita_ Yeah, all the signs point that way, delays right from the start of the season.
Force India's B-Spec car isn't ready until Britain now. Welp.
@tara_smiles I promise I will...ONLY because you insisted. :P
@tara_smiles Bless you, I'm not all that. Your time will come, trust me. :)
@katyfairman Also, I am SUPER jealous of you in Monaco right now, have a wonderful time. :) xx

Pascal Weirlein and now Esteban Ocon a part of the Mercedes umbrella. Starting to gather some talent there.
I think only if he absolutely loses his seat. I'm astonished he's constantly overlooked for top seats. 
Weren't Liverpool meant to be going in hard for Depay? Hah. Ed Woodward owns your soul Rodgers.

June to win today mate!! — Well called sir! 
Well freaking done Juventus. Totally deserved that win.
@JSPF1_10 @JoshuaSuttill @ABParadise Mhmm!
@JoshuaSuttill @ABParadise Touched by such incredible generosity. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
This is the most press the Italian league will get for 15 years.

Nice world goal, scored by the worlds greatest bit part player.
@ZaraZahid America's Got Talent has gone way too far!
Completely deserved by Juve. Playing excellent football so far.

@joshlem11 Thanks Josh, means a lot mate.
@ChrisThurgood77 That's subjective man. Wasn't intentionally trying to be sympathetic. Was just honest about my situation.
@ChrisThurgood77 Sure. But if people who do watch, want to help, that's their decision. If not, then fine. Should be as simple as that.
@ChrisThurgood77 Well, what's the point of doing it later if essentially begging all the same?
@ChrisThurgood77 It's not like we're not trying Chris. It's more difficult than you think it is, trust me.
Everyone's moral judgement is different. If people are willing to give, great. If not, that's great too. No need to be mad about it.
I would be lying if I didn't suspect a vitriolic backlash. To a degree, I understand. Really isn't worth kicking up a fuss mind you.
@ChrisThurgood77 Okay man.
@ChrisThurgood77 If only full time work was that simple... It's not just as simple as "get a job".
@ChrisThurgood77 Can only work what my employer gives me my friend. Applying for different jobs now Uni is finishing soon. Education 1st.
@CraigGraham94 3 in the Top 10? Man!
I prayed to your Dad, he wasn't overly generous. <WINKING FACE> 
@Tom97HD i didn't say 4 in a row? Bugger!
@TheRainMeister1 Don't be man, that's no problem at all! :)
@CoolSinan99 Don't be sorry man, thanks for spreading the word. :)
@JSPF1_10 Thank you so much. :)
@EclipseLunaDA Thank you so much Conner. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@Crekkan Anything helps. Thank you Gino. :)

Seriously, thank you so much.
Well, this video I just made should explain everything: 
Alright, let's give this a shot. Haven't really got anything to lose here in trying, right?
@NickGator Cena did the one thing so many Internet fans want him to do - Enhance other talent. Some people just don't get it.
@JasbyNature O_O I approve.
@SterIinho @F1gchr @_aarava Dude, I work 4 hours a week, and I'm still at University. Not that simple. Chill bruh.

@TheRealClassic A brilliant RAW debut for Sami Zayn in a match with John Cena. Both guys looked great. Excellent stuff all round.
Y'know, Cena and burial jokes stopped being funny around 2010, Internet.
@Stonejuices You need more sleep my friend. ;)
Very glad to hear Sami Zayn got his shot. Seeing him live was my personal highlight of my first WWE show last year.
Mind you, reading up on Lana's sudden character shift reminds me of every old-school Davison era Doctor Who companion. Welp.

@ZaraZahid Thank goodness Ding didn't make it through that Semi, not sure how well that would have gone down! :P
@StartWars54 I am SO jealous of you right now!
Finally putting together this #AskDre video! It'#ll be a good half an hour so no time for fancy editing, but enough me to knock someone out.
Happy Birthday King of Jerez! Have mercy on that cake! 
@Grace_Wilko Hey, hey, at least it's not a French baby. Chin up Wilko. :)
@Grace_Wilko Oooo, so close. ;) There's always Harry's eventual kids eh?
Shaun Murphy was 8-3 up. He's about to be 12-9 down. This is a Manchester United level collapse. Def Con 4. #ilovesnooker
@ZaraZahid Too busy dribbling. SMH.
Yeah, but which one?! 
@MotoGP You cannot be serious...
So close to the first Crucible Final 147, unlucky Stu! #ilovesnooker
I think I'm up to half a dozen girls on my timeline who are gutted Sergio Ramos is having a 2nd kid, lol.

@lharrisonx Nada!

fav motogp race of all time??? — Estoril 2006. 
@Crekkan @TheRainMeister1 For once, Crekkan's the sane one. I know, I'm stunned too.
@j_hussain The shit!
I already regret taking up this Skype idea.
@Crekkan @DannyBrennan72 @RyanErikKing @MarcusHoare1 I'M TOO TIRED FOR THIS SHIT.
A long ass week. Taking the Sunday off from Case Study shit and kicking back with some Ice Cream. Fuck it.
@RyanErikKing @Crekkan Yeah. why not. Fuck the case study. Top of the hour.
@tara_smiles @j_hussain Exactly.
Rate today's MotoGP moto2 and moto3 out of 10? — 4, 5, 8. 
@VoteMayorQuimby And Sony are still unaware of how to do sound right in its cars, 17 years later. Welp.
Thank you for your wonderful games.  
@DeAIID Marketing. Down with the young'uns. Hip. or something. Yeah, she's never been that great... anywhere.
@EdMillibanter This is definitely true. Three already.
No major loss. Her hypocrisy given her work with Max Kellerman (Also a woman abuser), says it all about her. 
@xsuperhan BOOOOOO! *throws tomato at you*
And now it's come to pass - I'm watching NASCAR. Welp.
And I added a new poll too - Who wins the title? Marquez, Rossi, Lorenzo or Dovi? Vote now! 
Jorge Lorenzo is back. And he's telling the kids to get off his lawn. My Spanish GP Review is now live: 
Kaboom. RT @bomani_jones: floyd’s gotta scour the globe for the 147 lbs gerry cooney for his last fight. see how dead boxing is then.
@QuizzicalOne Yup, said he wanted to give other people the chance to win them. His next fight in September will be his last.
@Crekkan Gino, this happens nearly every day.
Hakkinen or Schumacher? — Ah, it's gotta be Schumacher. I feel bad for Hakkinen though, he did beat Schumacher h...

Shit game. Bad referring on 2 missed penalty calls and way too many missed chances.
@DeAIID I'm starting to think 90% of boxing viewers think a fight is "Rock em' sock em'" robots.

Probably for the best.  
@ldyteemo Crikey!
#LOLManCityDefence
We'll talk about that new contract soon.  
@ariellec Yay! &lt;3
@DannyBrennan72 @MasterSwiiift Don't forget who owns your soul Brennan. ;)
@ZaraZahid It made me laugh okay! xD
@AfNino Works for me.
Right, Tottenham vs Man City always tends to produce fireworks - Can we get a Christian Eriksen hat-trick please? #FavouriteNonMUFCPlayer
@ZaraZahid ...Please, don't stop being awesome. :P
@ZaraZahid Yes, the vast majority can't stand him so, I wouldn't worry too much. He promotes himself.
@ZaraZahid Go on anything with comments regarding last night, and the wife-beating references are right at the top.
@ZaraZahid I hear you. Catch 22. Talking about it isn't really going to change anything either. And plenty of people do that as it is.
Christ, even JJ Watt addressing Chelsea. What a try hard, lol.
@ZaraZahid I'm not ignoring it though. I've spoken rather strongly about it before.
God, this is the flattest league title win ever.
Sport is full of bad people. Let's try and keep that and their personal lives apart, no? *(Not condoning that.) 
...And that NEVER gets old. 
@MasterSwiiift Yush. So, let's all scrap for 2nd!
Winning is everything. You don't win points for style. Well done Chelsea, Atletico and Mayweather, who understand how to do it.
Seeing this Indy Test reminded me of doing the virtual version on GT5, but with Le Mans cars. That was fun.
Now THAT'S a livery! #MURICA 
@sarahmufc93 Di Maria needs to be starting over Young. We're TOO posession focused, at least Di Maria takes a gamble.
Catching a bit of the Indy 500 testing, just a run of the mill 221mph average lap speed from RHR.
@PippaMann She's a beauty! :D
@TomStanley961 It's a work in progress!
Early congrats to @Tom97HD and Chelsea. Best team in the league by MILES this season.
Preston in the playoffs? Somewhere @OllyDawes just jumped out of the window.
@Tiametmarduk Loving the F1 2010 series mate, keep it up!
@ZaraZahid @bouncebckbltrx Can confirm!
@Marnie_xx A journalist for ESPN.
Why! Why did I make such terrible predictions this week?! Awful, awful weekend for yours truly. -_____-
@BombersportsUK Weird that isn't it? Qatar and Argie were 10's, but yeah, not much to really report on that one.
@ZaraZahid *hugs* Chin up dear, gritty 2nd! I'll take it!
And that'll do it from Jerez. Meh is the general term really, but Moto3 was fantastic again so go watch that. BSB quali up in 30,
@TheRainMeister1 Correct, he now has a 15 point lead on Dovi.
Hey media, you see that 15 second embrace between Marquez and Rossi? Yeah... #MotoGP
And Lorenzo breaks his flag trying to celebrate... This is how you know it's been a while. Fantastic, dominant all weekend.
And the 200th Grand Prix podium for Valentino Rossi. The Doctor is alive and well. #MotoGP
The roast of Andre Harrison, live on Friday Night on Downforce Radio at 8pm. #BikeLive
#99back
Never picking Rossi again. FFS.  
Midfield scrap, yes! #MotoGP
Heck of a gritty performance from Marquez today. Holding that Rossi threat. #MotoGP
Here we go again with Marquez vs Rossi maybe?! #MotoGP
Dovi with one incredible recovery. #MotoGP
@bouncebckbltrx Not really!
@bouncebckbltrx Having a crisis. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@BombersportsUK Stoner won't be riding his season.
@BombersportsUK About 270 horsepower these days.

Making Kendra's lunch, next thing you know, a lot of blood. Shit. 
@beck_j93 @BombersportsUK @CraigGraham94 Having watched that race, I'm not the only one!
@beck_j93 @BombersportsUK @CraigGraham94 quite? quite what? :P
The curious case of Tito Rabat continues. Who'd have thought a 3rd would still be so questionable. No answer for Folger. #Moto2
@statino99 I have no idea...
@BombersportsUK @beck_j93 @CraigGraham94 I wasn't saying THAT yesterday! At least Lowes did his best West Brom league impression! ;)
Missed in the shuffle - The best ride of Jonas Folger's career. Fantatsic performance. #Moto2
RINS YOU IDIOT
Of course you butchered your tyres Rabat, of course!
@beck_j93 @CraigGraham94 Typical, taking your frustration out on an innocent target just because your boy can't hack it. ;)
@CraigGraham94 Surprisingly okay with this!
"Who's that handsome British rider that's trending over here during this race?" "#KENT!" "...I can dig it!" #Moto3
Get the camera off of Lowes, he's 21st! :P #Moto2
Huewen with the front/rear wheel reference. DRINK! #Moto2
@beck_j93 SILENCE, YOU HEXER YOU! :P
:) 
@BombersportsUK @beck_j93 @sfray58 Correct.
Johann Zarco is riding like a man possessed! #Moto2
"To all those miserable Lowes fans looking at the tower..." :P #Moto2
My Rabat prediction looking healthy-ish. I like.
1-1 for yesterday Becks. HA! 
That could also apply. 
"Right on!" 
Hear that? It's the Sam Lowes hype train being derailed.
"Kent double passing at Turn 1 like a bad motherfuc-" "SHUT YOUR MOUTH!" "But I'm talking about Kent!" "I can dig it!" #Moto3
"Who's that raging God apex maker, shrugging off those divebombing Frenchmen?" "KENT!" "You're damn right!" #Moto3 #SHAFT
For fun, during the Danny Kent fanfare, we made a song about his win replacing the words from the theme of "Shaft". Seriously. #Moto3
@ZaraZahid @Re1axinmood I know I am!
@ZaraZahid @Re1axinmood 1) Doesn't mean it's okay. 2) BT Sport's is even worse.
Heck of a ride from #TheWeeMcPhee!  
MotoGP's 2nd best #52! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
You guys and your references! 
Nice try Fabio. Next time, hit the sidepod. #Moto3
DANNY FUCKING KENT. Outrageous final lap! #Moto3
@beck_j93 Man has a bike on top of him - Starts ranting!
Jakub Kornfeil is rather heated. #Moto3
JUSTIFIED.
Huewen waxing that lyrical over #52...
GODDAMN FABIO.
Vazquez...*plays Terminator theme* #Moto3
Yay, Kent is breaking these guys. Thank GOD. #Moto3
Danny Kent pulling the trigger. #Moto3
And still.
@TheChazmR Smokin'!

And now, I'm watching the Nebula League on rFactor. Good stuff.
1,600. That'll do for the night. Yush.
@ariellec They have to pay a $6,500 tab minimum to show the fight. $32 a head roughly. Do-able, but risky as a business.
Wasn't expecting that...So are you more passionate ab... — Yeah, football was the first sport I really got into ... 
If you could only watch one and not the other, Football or Motor Racing? — Football, easy. 
...everything else at the same time. It's crazy, especially when one of them is 6. Mum has new boyfriend, all that shit. Gah.
Man, being an oldest sibling and "man of the house" at 22 is tough. Knowing not to cross the line into "being a Dad", while juggling...
@JesseNichole (Y)
Are you mentally slow? — As much as I am on the autistic spectrum, no. 
1,100 down, 1,400 to go. At this point, I'm just spewing bollocks on Socrates and hoping it sticks.

@LouisSuddaby23 :'(
@GameRiotArmy You have to play no assists, on the hardest difficulty, you can't restart or corner cut, and drive clean OR YOU'RE A CHEATER!
@VivaMattyVegas People aren't going to suddenly stop ordering Mayweather or Pacquiao fights after this one ends.
Back to the case study for the night. That is unless Floyd feels like buying me some philosophers for this fucking thing.
@monsieurbenz Grass grows, birds fly...:P
@thomaske3 ...That's a good thing. Makes everyone more money.
And anyone who says Boxing is dead, or will die after this, is an idiot.  
Now, it's worth the equivalent of 1 rotational player at a big club. Bony-Mania! Herrera! Shaw! Carroll! *shot*

@mrhurriicane Fuck it, go full New England and take a Long Snapper.
Shaun Murphy might be the only Manchester United related victory in the month of May tomorrow if this keeps up. Can't wait!
@FFMattLane Man, my heart stopped beating during that frame.
Magnificent finale, and well deserved Stuart Bingham! 20 years and he's in his first Crucible final. Bravo to both warriors! #ilovesnooker
WHAT A SHOT.
A Kick?! In a finale? Holy crap...
Oh GOD, now Judd's up, I can't bear to watch...
Man, Bingham's last 3 shots. Sheer bravery. #ilovesnooker
Judd "Captain Louboutin" Trump is one gritty son of a bitch. Fantastic.
If there's one thing I've learned today, I'm genuinely world class in taking a roasting. SMH. *logs off*
@beck_j93 @ben_mcphillips Welcome to my valley of unhappiness!

@ariellec 14th time this month.
No idea what you're talking about. *throws another dart at my poster* 
Mate, Messi played this afternoon. 
Note: Red Dwarf Series 11 and 12 is the only reason I'm not going on a rampage through the streets of Southall tonight.
Thank GOD Chelsea have Liverpool next week. Until then EVERYONE suffers my wrath. I hope LvG gives RvP an ass whopping.
Manchester United. 
Give Myhill a pay rise.
Rooney, Di Maria, Mata, Falcao and Van Persie all on the field. Losing 1-0 to West Brom. We are utterly useless.
@Crekkan Not now Gino.
He's the 2nd most pissed off Harrison brother. 
BOTTLERS. Since when are we Derby County?

@PFF1 I'll take that as a "yes". ;)
@PFF1 You feeling the pinch from the lack of news PF? :P
Mayweather and Pacquiao are both hall of famers, Pacquiao is the fastest in boxing ... — I don't care about Boxing. 
I don't know what was worse - That half of football, or everyone freaking out over a normal looking baby.
Grass grows, birds fly... 
"OW MY FACE!" - Shoot that man.
Possession is 9/10th of the law in LvG's world. HOW ABOUT SCORING BRAH.
@KiLLaCaG These same people watch the NFL, who have a litter of DV abusers. There's no high horse to ride on here.
Man, we've missed RvP in the side. A proper poacher. Rooney is not that guy anymore.
@bouncebckbltrx I survived! Yay! &lt;3
Patriots going in HARD for guys who can stop the run. Me gusta.
Wonderful touch. Our thoughts are with you Rio and family. #MUFC
@TheBoys5Times Just a tad.

God, this is like watching United last week. 
@TheTajShow Great minds and all that.

@LX2xStone 
@LX2xStone The guy with the fastest time.
@LX2xStone Nah. He could make the argument he was on a hot lap himself.
@LX2xStone Kent got blocked on his final hot lap by Khariruddin.
@ZaraZahid He's 16, everyone is overage. :P
#Moto3 needs a Benny Hill remix for some of the shit this season that's happened.
Kent is going to be PISSED! But we have he youngest pole sitter in Moto history! Fabio! #Moto3

And before anyone asks, I really don't care. They'll both be richer than God after whatever happens and Facebook melts.
Fav f1 drivers top5 — Only have 4. Vettel, Hulkenberg, Raikkonen, Button. 
People were actually touting $100 for a WEIGH-IN for a boxing match. Ridiculous.

What did you make of "Senna" the docufilm? — It's decent. I'm not one of those guys who was emotionally invested... 
@Okwonga I'm firmly in the Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberley from the Power Rangers group here. Maybe I'm just young.
@j_hussain Meh. Mayweather by decision.
Yeah, in case you're one of the 12 F1 fans who haven't seen it, "Senna" is on ITV right now.
@j_hussain More painful than all the times he's torn his ligaments.
A $15m signing bonus for Jameis Winston. Sounds big, but that's with the cap rules. Sam Bradford's contract still makes my eyes water.

@ZaraZahid Maybe I'm overrating the task at hand but if Honda really wanted him to ride, they could have done it by now.
@ZaraZahid He tested last year, don't they know his requirements?
Nakamoto knows how good Casey is, he didn't need a damn test. Whatever HRC, lol. #MotoGP

@Shake_Well Deal.
Note: If I ever stay up till 5am for a Patriots draft pick again, you have permission to shoot me.

Oh, how about that, Lorenzo confirmed at Yamaha for 2016. Shocker.
So, 3 rounds in, 5 different guys on a podium, none of them Jorge Lorenzo. Who would have called that when he won the 2nd half of 2014?
I echo this sentiment. Bugger.

@TheRainMeister1 I say that, yet Hawkins has won 6 straight against Robbo, lol. I think Trump's nailed on though!
@kjwgaminghd No-one likes the ghost of Christmas Past. Chin up babe. &lt;3
Do you think the Snooker world is a little obsessed w... — Damn, that's a really good question. Short answer, pr... 
Word. Ground effects aero has done a brilliant job of having more side by side racing in IndyCar.  
Trump v Robertson final. Calling it now.
Why do you always play victim — Because mummy didn't make the nasty YouTuber go away! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
What's your beef with Gillon? He seems like a nice chap. — No beef. I just don't like him on Twitter. I don't th... 
Ah, there's the executive order on Sykes again. Ha.
@LouisSuddaby23 They nearly escaped us!
@LouisSuddaby23 Poimts for creativity!
Totally didn't just rewind RdP's attempt to torpedo Alex Lowes about 5 times over on these SBK Channel 4 highlights. :D (Don't tell Bex)
Unless it includes a day on set with Emilia Clarke, it ain't worth it. 
@HustleTheSavage Throw him in the pot with Ryback and Wyatt. #FailedPushes
"I'm tired, awful, and having a terrible day and I feel ill... This requires a selfie on Instagram!" #WelcomeTo2015
I found it ironic and a little hilarious that Sky had the audacity to ask fans if the price was too high. (Who charge £26 a month for it.)
Did you see the Hull/Liverpool boycott? Are ticket pr... — Yeah, I did, heard 1,000 fans didn't show up despite ... 
In other news, Killer Instinct got the rights to The Human Torch. Mixed with Bruce from Tekken's kickboxing. 
Reckon there's a possibility that Australia ISN'T the... — I just saw Jon Noble of Autosport have that theory an... 
Your company is cursed bruh. 
@Ayden_Brooks26 You could apply that to just about any month the British GP just so happened to fall in!
Yay, Santa Bernie, you got me what I always wanted - An Azerbaijan Grand Prix! 
An F1 season starting in April. With 20 races inevitably booked, an F1 season could end in December. DECEMBER. Yikes.
Note, that will be the last Podcast I create as my Uni assignment. I now gotta decide whether I continue it.
NEW PODCAST - Episode 17 of #Motorsport101: "Newgarden of Eden" just went live with me and @RyanErikKing! Enjoy! 
@MyNamesJarod LOYALTY BRAH.
@DarcSeven Nice try Steve. ;)
10,000 answered questions. Fuck. Nice to know my thoughts are worth that much to you all. You crazy mothertruckers.
If you had to play one FPS and one Racing game for th... — FPS - Halo 3. One of the all-time greats. Racing game... 
Alright, I'm at 9,999. Who wants the honour of being my 10,000th answered question? 
Am I going to be your 10000th answer?:) — Ooo, 3 short. 
@JesseNichole That was utterly adorable, and awesome. :)
Did you see the alex gillon video where he calls u out? — Why would I watch a Gillon video? 
Are you really 33? — Nope, I'm 22. I know, it's terrifying. 
These are 12 year olds Tara, they still think the pinnacle of life is a woman's vagina. 
Lol you're 33 wtf. You seem to be older than the rest of the community jimmy — Yeah, I've aged well. 
Still making mum jokes at 33 years of age. Deffo a vi... — Virginity jokes - The mature and classy Internet insult.

Don't be happy because Liverpool will still get the fourth spot. And Arsen... — And I will marry Jennifer Lawrence.

@JasbyNature Mhmms.
@mattyb50 :)
Good for Dortmund, hope they can give Klopp a trophy on the way out. Also, LOLerpool.
Get Bayern all the way outta here.
You love Mickey, Alex Armageddon and Hyperdix really ... — Yes. I love them so much I have them blocked for thei... 
@kjwgaminghd Feel free to FB if you wanna talk, I'm all ears.
@kjwgaminghd What's happened to you now?!
@DannyBrennan72 This time tomorrow? This Pizza is calling me!
If it makes you feel any better, you're still better than those other Merseyside bastards. 
Holy fuck, Podolski scored a goal and Dortmund aren't mediocre. Truly the end of days.
@CraigGraham94 @RyanErikKing LOL at everything here.
@TheTajShow What a truly sickening front 3. Almost all of the goals delightful too.
So how's Barca doing, was 1-0 before we star-...Oh. Shit.
New episode of #Motorsport101 taped and should be live tonight! I seriously spend more time on witty episode names these days.
What are the chances of a team asides from Mercedes o... — Next to zero. Williams and Red Bull are way, WAY behind. 
100 between Messi, Neymar and Suarez. Shit,
#LOLIker #BarelyAnUpgrade
micky motionz literally recks you in everything — Good. Hope he can afford the extra Freedo's with that YouTube ... 
@ariellec I use the one for my website too, so I know the feeling!
@ariellec Liked!
Think we need to get our wallets and pockets empty to... — Yep, definitely. I don't think Casey would have been ... 
@RyanErikKing Very true indeed.
And what's funny about that story - Bernie actively trying to get the costs down. So much for being the Internet panto villain.
At least we got another buzz topic for the first 10 minutes of the Podcast when we tape in 20 minutes, lol.
@Crekkan Sure. That's pretty much what Social Media regarding F1 is these days.
@Crekkan Wasn't the buzz topic 1,000bhp V6's last week?
@Crekkan Because it'll never happen, lol.
@JesseNichole 14 hours. I'll get the defibrillator.
(And let's be real here, no-one wants to be the Tier 2 in a two-tiered system.)
Shame it's about as meaningless as a Scott Speed highlight reel. 
Lovely idea that Force India have...If you're poor. #F1
What do you think of Robin Van Persie? Seems like he only had 2-2&amp;1/2 really g... — Probably isn't worth the wages. 
Burying my head in the sand for a week or two. 
@Eddie_Boshell Yup. But no-one really cares about that.
Strike another assignment off the list. 1 down, 3 to go before eternal free-from-Uni glory.
Do you agree that by letting Hiroshi Aoyama race, Honda ha... — Nope. Because only the highest scoring bike counts. 
@ariellec *takes notes for future life*
@ariellec Silverfox huh? Guess that works, lol!
@xsuperhan Have a safe flight, and a wonderful time darling. :) Feel free to let me babysit the XB1. :D
@ariellec Spare a thought for the ugly squad of Manchester. We're gonna look so out of place. :P
@Grace_Wilko Truly a system of subsidised, quiz show, struggle.
@Grace_Wilko Grace going mute up in here? :P
Ah, these were the days. 
@circuitamericas Fell in love with the Scarlet red of Ferrari after Father Harrison made me watch with him in 1998. #HowIBecameAFan
Ah, just starting to get my head down and start wrapping up these final assignments. The end is nigh... I have to be an adult. Shit.
Paulo Dybala is the new Fredy Guarin, with Zamparini is new hype man. How much do you wanna bet no-one actually buys him?
@DannyBrennan72 Sure!
@DannyBrennan72 Late tonight I promise we'll do Australia again. If not, I'm sledgehammering your Internet box.
@DannyBrennan72 I was busy last night! I'm still scarred from that race!
Looks like Hiroshi Aoyama will fill in again at Jerez. Hopefully he'll give Eugene Laverty a good fight. *rolls eyes*
I'ma ask again @Official_CS27 - How quick can you get to Spain?
BREAKING: Dani Pedrosa will NOT ride in Jerez. #MotoGP
@TheRealEWolff Still quite low level. The viral stuff is more like the famous clip of the black mother getting his son out of the riots.
@RyanErikKing Excellent! :D 4 hours from now sound good?
@xMattyG @AmyyTheEngineer No Copyright Sounds are excellent for this sort of thing, was a nice booster for me on occasion.
Also, under the radar in that gossip post, interesting that Ferrari admitted building their 2015 car more for Kimi. Hmmm.
Now, who WOULDN'T want to see that?  
@Grace_Wilko Nothing a cooker won't fix. #UKIPBBQ
@Grace_Wilko Burn it. Slowly and painfully.
@WorldSnooker1 #PredictRonvBing O'Sullivan 13-8 Bingham.
A shame it makes for easy views, not to mention the easy emotional crossover given Michael's condition. Inevitable. 
Can you say what mickey did not have twitter — 
Why do so many people use Marc Marquez in comparison ... — Excellent question, and you're right, I've heard that... 
BRUH, LOTFUS-CHEEK WILL BE STARTING NEXT SEASON.  
You're building an F1 team with an open chequebook and everyone's on the ... — Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton. 
@jmikemac Oh yes, Nike loved them some pointless flair. 
Sky F1 really going all in over...broadcasting times. Glad to see they're tackling the real issues, lol. (Races could be at 4am, we'd watch)
@paulsinha What in the HELL...
@jmikemac @RachaelKrishna Yep, this is when you know James is back.
Jesus, Trump destroying ol' Ding right now. Back on form! #ilovesnooker
And Franz fucking Beckenbauer has said this. #Messiah 
@RyanErikKing Fancy a new Podcast tonight? I promise we'll talk long and hard about your beloved IndyCar. :P
As I tweeted a couple of weeks ago, they've won over half the races in F1 since 2008.  
@DarcSeven I dunno, is it? Guess it goes against tradition, but I think the more subtle tone and the natural flow of gameplay works better.
Unpopular opinion: I prefer the Brutalities over the Fatalities in MKX.
@HustleTheSavage HYPE.
6 months later, I enjoy it more than anything. Amazing how things change. 
@lharrisonx Welp!
@lharrisonx Then how the hell did you pull that one off?!
@lharrisonx Are you drunk again?
@RyanErikKing Well, Last Week Tonight's going to have a field day with this one. You know, the alarmingly best sense of news these days.
@DarcSeven Blazblue Brah!
Just saw the breaking news for it. This is going to get even uglier. 
*sighs* I don't even know what to say. Just wow.  #BaltimoreRiots
You really need to stop this shit 2K. 
@kjwgaminghd What have you done now Wintringham?!
Fantastic freaking trailer Max!

@RyanErikKing Yeah, that one I heard about...

@monsieurbenz I'm a sucker. :P Fire away!
@monsieurbenz You do that ALL the time. :P
Just to say about the Rosberg Schumacher match up Sch... — Yes, but he also plowed into the back of Jean-Eric Ve... 
@RyanErikKing Jesus...:/
Alarming how relevant this is, re: Baltimore. 
Their shit is FAR from a secret.  
@monsieurbenz Pfft. Being Real Madrid keeper is an ebola sandwich anyway. :P
@Rheanna_F1 I can only imagine! :) #Hot
@monsieurbenz -_-" Keylor WHO?!
@Rheanna_F1 Okay, that's really freakind cool!
@JasbyNature Nothing more than minor rumours and Manchester United fans losing their damn minds.
De Gea to Madrid. I hope he pulls his mask off and reveals he's actually been Wesley Sneijder all along.
If the opportunity ever came, would you want to do YouTube as your full time job? — No. Far too unpredictable. 
If Lester gets to heated regarding Lotus or something, I'll just summon my Dark Magician.
I CHALLENGE HIM TO A DUEL. 
@AmyyTheEngineer THE PAIN!
Well played fellas. 
@jakesanson @Jakepetrolhead That's me most days. Happy normal day Sanson. ;)
Can we form a kickstarter to build Eddie Howe a plinth in Bournemouth? What an amazing job, and an amazing story. What Football's all about.
@Gmullen2810 Nyck must have still thought it was Tooned, circa 2012.
Who would you rather have in your team now: Daniel Ri... — Daniel Ricciardo. Just a little bit less risky than N... 
I'll try: "What's that fucking Lotus doing there?!" 
You're acknowledging Lewis is an all time great? — Keep up homie, I've been saying it since last November. 
@BombersportsUK After!

Gutsy effort as always @TheCaptain147, you're still a hero to me.
And we got our power back. Back uploading again now, should be roughly another 45 minutes.
“@Ayden_Brooks26: @Harrison101HD Back then every text message was green” - #TheStruggleIsReal
So yeah, one hour delay on new video. Hopefully we'll be back up soon.
No power in the house. So this is what the Stone Ages was like, minus the iPad. Fack.
@Tom97HD Cheeky bastard!
Seriously - Thanks for the great questions today folks, really, really good stuff. Looking forward to tackling the #AskDre pile tonight!
@frankmiller187 @NickGator @CFH_Chief Tbf, this is a problem with the format of Last Man Standing matches in general. Pacing nightmare.
@VoteMayorQuimby @Tom97HD ...And that new stadium's over a billion.
United's window was £150m this past summer. Every big club has realized you gotta spend money to make money. Chelsea were just first.
Money injection? Man City did it. Liverpool's spent a Quarter Billion the last 3 years. Even Arsenal's made more marquee signings.
Moh from Arsenal TV has probably shed many tears over this one. 
I call a spade, a spade. Chelsea have been as consistently great as anyone the last 10 years. 
@VETTF1 That definitely works.
@Jakepetrolhead That was never a doubt. The BBC themselves said they were going to try and bring it back next year, despite "difficulties".
Do you consider Chelsea a big club or a recently succ... — It's all down to perception really. What do you consi... 
Relax, your hero's next fight with draw just as many buys with no risk of coke related accidents. 
Interesting. Show was gonna die in 3 years anyway. 
@SkySportsF1 Definitely! Much friendly time worldwide. F1 tries so hard to breach new markets, so why not make it friendlier for all!
@riotgrrrrrrrrl Agreed! <FACE THROWING A KISS><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Very interesting debate on #bbcsnooker about the push for the Snooker to be an Olympic sport. Decent points on both sides.
@tara_smiles O_O
No-one likes a hernia. :P 
@TheeUnderBrake Just finished now, thank God, people have been asking for this for nearly a month!
Lot of news dropping today, FINALLY getting around to recording my IndyCar commentary. Done, so yeah, out in a few hours!
@riotgrrrrrrrrl Oh my...
Wonderful! Congrats to all! :D 
£22.50 to enter DiRT Rally's early access by the way. Pay once, you never pay again, so if you're a fan, it's the best price avaliable.

HOLY MOTHER OF- 
STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND LISTEN 
@AmyyTheEngineer @xMattyG Oh I think you've had it plenty of times. :P
No. Just no. 
@RachaelKrishna I... erm... no.
@riotgrrrrrrrrl HA! Called it!
@riotgrrrrrrrrl Until you inevitably spend way more money again. :P

@AmyyTheEngineer Okay, you have to admit, that is a little bit hilarious. :P
Anyway, time to crack on with that much requested IndyCar video. It's definitely coming today, I promise.
Best run of Ask.FM questions I've had in a while. Check them out, really good stuff on British hopes in F1 and the nature of YouTube.

No Jay, just admit you dun goofed at this one.  
@xsuperhan the "lorry drivers arm" is developing! <WINKING FACE>
It's not a massive deal, as Williams get a bunch of historical payments and shit, but it's still pretty eye-raising. 
All of them.  
#LRT - And that was the 3rd best team in the field last year. This is why F1 is fundamentally screwed.

Why does no one want to start an F1 team? 
@JesseNichole Wouldn't look outta place.

Urge to rant...rising...But nah. Not worth the bother.
@kjwgaminghd Seconded. God. Damn.
Bruh, that kid needs help.
*punts kitten into oblivion* 
So, when does Real Madrid bid £50m on Kane?
Also, fucking hilarious that Hazard won overall, but wasn't Young...Why WOULDN'T you double up?
Lol city r beating you — Wow, you must be new here! 
@lucyefcf1 No shit. :P
And yeah, congrats to Eden Hazard. Phenomenal season and a destructive force on the left wing. #ThankGodItWasntSanchez #MyAskWouldBeAIDS
David De Gea 3rd! We'll take that! :D
Hang on just a minute, so if Kane beat Hazard for the JUNIOR award... 
@Nina_candy @Jamesrkobird Yeah, was gonna tweet you. Welp. :/
@OfficialDWhite YUP!
That was better than any F1 race we've had this season.  The series needed a race like that. #IndyCar
Dre's Rating: 8.5/10 - About time IndyCar! Some great action throughout and a brilliant ending with Rahal driving like a man possessed!

What is going on with Daniel Bryan for him to be scratched from the card?
Sage Karam is going HAM. #IndyCar
This race is NUTS.
@Nina_candy Will do, if there's a cupcake in it for me. ;)
@Nina_candy Too early, it's the usual "insiders" that always break this first.
@F1_Obsessive 4-2 win - You veto the right to complain. Nice shirt though!

Also, how about the Mayor of Hinchtown looking competitive? Yush! #IndyCar
James Jakes has stalled it with Coletti. CAUTION! #IndyCar
That works too.  
I'm listening to @RyanErikKing's roommate swear like he's in an Olympic Final right now. It's like I'm listening to an audio Pornhub.
Drive through for Power. These Australians, coming over here, stealing our racing lines...#IndyCar
Let's hold up the entire race while we discuss Power's wankerisms. #IndyCarLogic
I'MA JUST TURN IN ON SATO, HE'LL YIELD!

@kjwgaminghd O_O :*
This is how you know I'm getting old - When you look at YouTube's Top 100 and barely recognize 25 people. 
That crazy moment you realize KSI now has more Subscribers than Syndicate.
@RyanErikKing I know. I'm as shocked as you are.
Also, I hope BO3 has exos just to piss you all off.
I'm actually looking forward to IndyCar now as today has frustrated the SHIT out of me.
Also, nice to see PES's system is nearly as broken as FIFA's with lack of duplicates and guaranteed broken cards if you spend big.
@EdCallison Lotus doing a filming day. F1 cars, new and old.
Annoyed with myself that I couldn't get myself to Brands tomorrow. Coursework comes first.
Imagine thinking your football franchise has never sucked.
My mentions are now a dick measuring contest. 
BRUH.  
When you were getting 10,000 views on YouTube, how much money were you getting? — Not enough. 
No. Even more so that last gens been thrown under the bus.  
No. #BlackOps3

Thanks guys. Being an NFL fan whenever I see reports of concussions I go mad, especially with how BAD football is with it.
@riotgrrrrrrrrl Oh I hate you! xD
@F1Maestro26 Cheers.
@AfNino Seems odd considering he was taken to hospital at half time from what I'm reading...
I didn't watch the game, is it true Oscar had a clear concussion, but was allowed to continue?
Seek help girl. ;) 
Last 3 frames, Ronnie O'Sullivan has been absolutely insane. #BBCSnooker

I really like your podcasts, Andre. Keep up the good work! — Thank you! :)

@ben_mcphillips Take it on, I'd love to read it. So much in F1 success is down to timing.
(It's like an ol' #HamCaper rush on Ask. It stops being fun after the 17th appearance.)
Well, I'm no longer watching the game, only because Brother Ryan will spend the next 45 minutes bitching about Falcao. Again.
@ben_mcphillips Not denying that. I'm just putting myself in their shoes. It's an easy thing to be frustrated at.
@R_A_J Yeah. As I've always said, people overrated Red Bull's level of dominance. Hamilton's only competition, is clearly worse than him.
@ben_mcphillips Oh Ben...
Trust me, if you're an Alonso fan, you have EVERY right to feel that way. Hamilton's had it on a plate FOREVER. 
Anything less than assault from Van Gaal during this half time team talk isn't good enough. I hope McNair refuses to get him a steak.
End of the season comes and Lewis Hamilton is a triple world champion with 50... — Yes. Don't rub one out too hard. 
Remember when we all ripped City a new one? That was fun.
Manchester United, making things difficult for themselves since 2013.
You're dealing with a guy so obsessed with me, he has me blocking him like some kind of trophy. Allow it.

@sarahmufc93 Given Fella's last season at Everton, I'm not so sure...
Our entire season has been banter. 
predictions for 2day? — Me doing nothing? Oh you mean the game? Draw. 
@lucyefcf1 Have a good one. ;)
Still, fuck it, David Based De Gea made it in, so I'm happy.
I'd argue the surprise factor of Harry Kane's improvement should be worth a spot. Aguero scores in bunches.  
Coutinho? #Nah 
@CraigGraham94 THREE Craig? Are you taking the piss? :P
Don't forget too folks, you got till Midnight to send in your #AskDre questions, so get them in!
I expect the cheque in the mail Crekkan.  
Least he'll lift the award for him though, amirite? 
See also: The friendzone, Crekkan's AOR Pro Mazda footage, and Alain Prost's racing career. 
Ah, the plight of being an F1 fan.

Any Particular Favourite? — No. Not a massive fan of any of them. Just decent. 
Have you seen any/all of the Star Wars films? — All 6. Mixed bag to say the least. 
What's your currently favorite show on TV? — The Last Leg. Fantastic satire.

That's raw on Mayo, getting 3 off the board 20 seconds AFTER being called good. #NBAPlayoffs
Depends. Is Kelly Brook single again?!  
Note to self: Milk chocolate HobNobs are more satisfying than any girlfriend could be.
Note to self: watch more basketball next season.
Jimmy Butler has 28 of the Bulls' 59 right now, lol. #NBAPlayoffs
@CoolKevF1 I said I wasn't answering it - Why was a discussion required?
@CoolKevF1 That's my decision to make.
Fastest guy on F1 2014? — Not answering this, league fanboys are going to flood my damn Inbox. 
Bless your soul, but I know I'm not in their league.  
Given the reactions to whenever he speaks, I think it's a lot more than that. Nice meme though. ;)

@FrazAFC94 That says a lot more about our football coverage than it does about him.
F1 Twitter - Where 75% gets trolled by people who aren't even on it! 
@FrazAFC94 Victim of the "banter" era. His Tottenham run was FAR from terrible.
And to those I say, google how well Michael Jordan has run the Bobcats! 
And the funny thing is, Jacques' HAS made valid points before. People are going mad because it's HIM saying it.
Y'all still biting on whatever Jacques Villeneuve has to say? Come on guys, you're all smarter than that.

@CraigGraham94 Such greed Graham, such greed. ;)
(Dear God, this isn't going to end well. :P #AskDre)
THIS WASN'T MY IDEA. But yeah, it can be absolutely anything this time, so use #AskDre and let me have it. Video on Monday. Go forth!
So, as part of my Uni assignments, I was told doing an #AskDre video again would be a great idea, so, yeah...let's do it.
@KiraShadowcat And have a wonderful birthday sweetheart. Love you. :) &lt;3
Completely missed @CalHD1 hitting 800 like a terrible person! Congrats man, you and @Tom97HD working damn hard. Go get it.

This is one of those: "Don't push the button" moments, isn't it? 
Indeed. I now need 125 hours of counselling. 
Also, I'm now contemplating what's more weird, THAT video, or Jared Leto's joker look.
I TRIED MAN, I TRIED. 
...Also, do yourself a favour, DO NOT click the trend of the certain Tottenham footballer trending, if you still value your soul.
Also, I'm sure this guy is a perfectly nice bloke, but this HAS to be the most fanboyish channel name ever. 
Name it "F1 2015", that'll get some people mad. :P 
Props to @BombersportsUK, he's determined to get me out of the house for Motorsport. :P BSB Showdown could definitely be a thing!
@BombersportsUK @LouisSuddaby23 @beck_j93 Now THERE'S an idea. ;)
Also, I feel like an idiot for dropping a convo because of that race. DAMMIT.
@LouisSuddaby23 @BombersportsUK @beck_j93 @MotoGP Unlikely due to money issues, but maybe via a miracle nearer the time.
And my arms are dead after that race. JESUS.
And that was the first time I raced with the top level AI. Freaking hard, really got in the zone. Strategy worked out nicely though!
Freaking tense co-op race with @DannyBrennan72!

Would Gundogan be a good signing? — I'm very confident he will, we need another mobile and dynamic playmaker in ... 
Highly recommended, a fascinating watch as I didn't understand just how special an athlete he was.  
Thanks for listening folks - I will now remove Bex's high heels after she inserted them in my neck for that Lowes joke. ;)

@MazzaLOP Agreed, we need a well-rounded midfielder who's mobile. Could work VERY well in a 4-3-3. HYPE!
ANTHONY GODDAMN MCGILL! Don't even care about my lost bet, well done kid! #TeamGinger #ilovesnooker
During the Speedway break for me - Can I just say, SO HYPED to potentially sign Ilkay Gundogan. #MUFC
Brace yourselves, Bex will be unleashed on Speedway next! #BikeLive
I'd be okay with this, but would take a LOT of time with a 34 bike field. 
I'm getting bullied on tonight's show. ;_; #BikeLive

Hey @Join_Dave - Any chance of you guys getting "They Think It's All Over"  on the books?
LEGENDARY.  
@LouisSuddaby23 @beck_j93 I'm a year older than you, you have no excuse! ;)
If its not hosted by Nick Hancock with David Gower and Lee Hurst, I'm not interested! 
That is an annoyingly gorgeous shade of blue. 
Speaking of which - "The Evolution of Lewis Hamilton", a Dre TV Special is out in half an hour. :)
TL:DR version - We're putting TOO much stock into Hamilton re-signing. If I was getting a raise to £27m, I'm reading that deal 17 times.

@monsieurbenz Fuck that, that's a bye!
And congrats to Real Madrid for making the final.
We're getting the two best teams in the world head to head early - Barcelona vs Bayern. Can't wait.
Oh come on, we all know you want Juventus! They're football's best flat-track bullies! 
@twittannii Cutie :3

Who's more talented, Rossi or Vettel? And don't give me any of this "you can't compare" malarkey — Valentino. 
I mean, shit, I've just given them more attention than anything their channels could have done this month, so everyone's a winner, lol.
The 2013 trolly side of the F1 Community is still a thing? Was it open day on the loony farm? Fucking hell, makes me laugh.
@Crekkan Once you go black...You get bad credit.

No it isn't Mickey. Sup Harrison it's me Alex Armageddon. How has your life been hmm... — ...This is still a thing? 
@BombersportsUK Completely agreed. 6 Hour races, split between 3 guys...It's not a good mix to try and stand out.
@DannyBrennan72 He's F1's walking equivalent of the friend zone.
I would say he'd be the WEC's gain, but the series just doesn't generate star power, he'd be wasted there too.
@BombersportsUK @lharrisonx $$$$$
@beck_j93 WELP.

@RyanErikKing It was a simpler time. We actually made videos for fun back then!
@thomaske3 ...There's a community? :P #GoodJoke
I'M THE BEST IN THE WORLD, AT WHAT I DO...(God knows what that is, these days) 
@thomaske3 It was a better time in 2011. Far less complicated. :P
I mean, I'd be mad about it too, but then again, 75% of the people on here have been doing it so, fuck it. #DontHateThePlayer #HatetheGame
Back in my day, it was latino women in thumbnails. Now, it's video titles. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Sheer destruction - Juventus by 28 points. Won the title in freaking March. Andrea Pirlo averaged 7.86 a game! 
Kevin Volland was my surprise amazing signing, had 29 goals on the Right Wing, 7.56 average rating. Angel Di Maria had 27 assists.
Okay, we can breathe, Bayern won by 19 points!

@MarcusHoare1 @RyanErikKing @DannyBrennan72 SILENCE all of you! Roasting King is MY job!
No-one likes a boring winner folks - Hence why Sebastian Vettel and Alain Prost will (imo) never get the true credit they deserve.
@MarcusHoare1 You could argue Ronnie O'Sullivan, but his was never that kind of extreme.
Harsh - Gazza's downfall was self-inflicted. Senna was just Senna. That Paradox with him still confuses me today. 
That question took me 15 fucking minutes to answer. It's like the YouTube comment section on a 90's F1 vid: "INSERT DRIVER 'X' WAS BETTER!"
