Good time to mention the closing line on this game was Atlanta -4.5 (h/t @Royce3D )
@caseyacagle I feel your pain. Has to be exhausting to watch so much talent under achieve and just look listless for extended stretches.
Watching the #WizHawks series feels like the NIT while the other 6 teams are in the NCAA tournament. Cept the Rockets, they're CBI material
@So_Money_Sports it's like being the toughest smurf...
On news of Brady suspension @LVSuperBook re-opens #Patriots -1 vs the #Steelers for Week 1, total of 49 (originally opened -6 and 53.5)
Let the Jimmy Garoppolo era begin 
@jbarbarito only shop I saw offering that prop was @BovadaLV , not sure if others have since posted as well
@livewebpicks  haha when you're captain of a winless hockey team senior year there's a lot of heartbreak throughout the winter
Always good to return to your roots and remember where you laid the foundation @GrotonSchool #15years 
Apparently the Grizz have nothing to do with the current state of affairs 
@FNPNASCAR @FOXSports they say this country was built on hope and a dream.  I quite enjoy my time in clear air
#ProfitableSportsGaming
@JT1045 @ClayTravisBGID @TNSteeplechase  O/U on shoes Clay comes home with is 1.5, heavy juice to the under
@crazyjamoke29 grew up on WEEI during boarding school, now getting my fill of Felger and Mazz.
I forget how much fun it is being back in Boston listening to local sports talk radio, passion 2nd to none especially given Brady situation
@BigDogwdae passengers might be generous, that would have meant actually getting on the team bus to arrive at Amalie for puck drop.
@JeffSchultzAJC  also went from -165 to win series out to -270 after full x-rays/mri results were disclosed.
@World_Wide_Wob well now you know what I'm rooting for especially after ringing the post (cc: @chriswerme15 )
@Schack17 the entire city of Chicago might have me on a manhunt if they blow this 3 goal lead...
@BarstoolBigCat never in doubt, just the way you drew it up on the ole gambling chalkboard
@Schack17 ha read my mind, just dug it up to tweet again. Pretty impressive memory my friend
Valiant effort from the #Wild to even make the postseason this year but it's time to employ the summer mascot again 
@BarstoolBigCat you mean for under bettors right?
@PhilMackey it's not an indictment of the Wild at all..most NHL teams can't find the level the Hawks play at during the postseason
@mdownes311 Jones 3-1, Crafton 7-2, Newman 4-1, and Sauter 9-2 were your top for favorites for the race
@katiebakes I'll admit that may very well be a fair personal indictment of the kind of content I've been known to consume on social media
@katiebakes not of same fervor. Almost like murder from athletes is "accepted"whereas tarnishing integrity of sports on field is worse
@jegriffey ah, if that's the case then we're definitely out of luck. Had no idea the NFL along with HBO built in that stipulation
I'm now convinced more than ever if Hard Knocks doesn't go to Cowboys camp we're all being done a grave injustice.
@413FantFootball @SteveTweetstoo I think that's exactly it. Seems like societal trend is to root for stars to fail or get mad about nonsense
@ClayTravisBGID just follow the bag man, you'll eventually find your answer
@413FantFootball @SteveTweetstoo no argument and not indicting NFL here more of a social criticism at laege about all of our priorities
@bearinvegas @rich_witt1 no one who watches college or pro sports should assume athletes operate with integrity or honesty, lets be real
When Tom Brady deflating balls creates a bigger social media craze than Aaron Hernandez murdering people we need to adjust #NFL priorities
ON THE RISE: #Mets, #Astros , &amp; #Royals have seen the biggest surge in their futures price amid hot starts 
Hey look, another buzzer beater in the greatest postseason in all of sports #BecauseItsTheCup
@BeatinTheBookie @TheRealMrACL you guys act like I'm a Pats fan...had BAL that game but as per the league that was legal, hence rule change
@TheRealMrACL @highlifeman1 every team tries to gain an edge, the better the team more scrutiny.  Pats didn't bludgeon Colts because o balls
Looking for a preview of this weekend's #SpongeBob400 ? @FNPNASCAR shares their thoughts on drivers to watch 
@dangerlenny the reality is every college or professional team breeds an environment of cheating to gain an edge, nature of sport
@husker3098 yep. Don't get me wrong, I hate the Pats because they've cost me a fortune betting against them but it's purely business ha
The amount of bitter fans insinuating the entire Patriots dynasty is tainted because of #DeflateGate is beyond absurd
@JJEvans9 don't see a whole lot of value in the Rangers, game feels like a coin flip.  Can see grabbing the Price with a desperate Habs team
I didn't see "cocktail waitress" as a potential listed option 
@MicahRoberts7 @nw3 @golfodds as someone sitting on a Grizzlies future loved the fight but won't claim to be optimistic about pulling upset
@MidMajorMatt every NBA playoff game lists traveling at 100-1n like seeing a unicorn.
@ColinSubick aka the Blues being the Blues once they start playing for keeps. Tonight def wasn't on Devan, can't win when you don't score
@TcChamp76 you'll never hear me defend Crawford, I think he's an average talent surrounded by elite teammates.
@Mattkrebsbach21 won't blame him for being on an island just a bad goal a night won't cut it. @dw7777777 makes a good pt, fatigue apparent
@Walanka be careful, somewhere out there @KJMediaDarling might take offense to that remark
@JJEvans9 ha, how quickly we forget where he came from.  I figured I'd forgive him for the short stint in that southwestern hockey wasteland
Devan Dubnyk looks a lot like the goalie the Oilers traded in this series
@SpreadsNThreads they actually kept him for a year to build a database and the company also hired a handful of in-play traders
REAL ADVANTAGE? Per @PinnacleSports bet shares Real Madrid garnering 85% of the DNB tickets and 62% of the action in the 3 way market. #UCL
The real winners from the PacMan vs Mayweather rematch chatter? Sports bettors...start saving now because round 2 won't be different #value
If you've ever wondered what "Parking the Bus" looked like in hockey, I cite the @washcaps defensive effort in the 3rd as an illustration
@ClayTravisBGID @ChrisVernonShow @TheLanceTaylor other decent sized move you saw was on the series from a low of -135/-140 out to -170/-175
@thespinzone I haven't seen a major book offer AHL lines nightly since the NHL was going through their lockout
@ChrisVernonShow @TheLanceTaylor @ClayTravisBGID yep, LT is right opened -3 immediately bet to -5/5.5 speculating no Paul, now its public $
Pure gold for anyone from the Nintendo generation 
@jvolpentesta @haralabob @World_de_Q @BillSimmons Cavs are listed as -220 favs at @PinnacleSports
@Drren_Rvell @brandonnagy 
@JimmyTraina believe @SportsInsights shared it was back in 2008
Will American Pharoah win the #Preakness ? Yes +100 / No -140.  Currently listed at 9-4 to win the Triple Crown (via @BovadaLV )
@T_James32 that's a good talk. Ignorant is a dangerous way to go through life, appreciate your character profiling of me so thank you.
@brandonnagy ah that's bad, lost in translation yep 4M buys
@tpenick13 correct.  There would be no secondary ticket market if there wasn't a demand for the product. No such thing as a free lunch
@brandonnagy numbers I saw anticipated between 4 and 4.5M, don't believe a final tally has been released but the O/U initially was 3.15 buys
@brettborz bingo. You had 47 examples of the product you'd consume. It's like going to a movie w/out reading reviews and being surprised
@ProfessorShine think that's the perfect way to look at it. Not sure why people expected a 12 round brawl, we had 47 Floyd case studies
Capitalism is funny...items are worth what people will pay so calling 99.95 for the fight a ripoff is funny when $4M in buys says otherwise
@JoeFortenbaugh the more of this series I watch going to need learn the French for "stupid penalty" and "undisciplined."
The degree of difficulty for Stamkos to corral the puck on edge there was ridiculous (cc: @BigDogwdae )

(via @PetrosAndMoney) 
@Mikey_Golds @moosewilson  if you guys can email me 
. @Sportsbook_com ended up tripling their betting handle last night compared to previous best boxing matchup between '07 Floyd &amp; De La Hoya
@dabearmc @JoeFortenbaugh no doubt about it. Any time a book offers a yes/no generally easier for something "Not" to happen than to happen
@PCarrESPN can make the argument Mourinho landed more jabs during the Premiership season than Floyd did last night
@RyanFieldFS1 when the sun comes up in this town, that's your sign to head home.  Thanks again for inviting me on boys @DonBellONFOX
@TRUEHYPE I don't think people realize how difficult it is to box at this level. Try the sport for 3 mos, just training, you respect this.
Those that are angry: everyone that bought this fight on PPV expecting action. Those that are ecstatic: every bookie from here to Timbuktu
@CaliDreamin777  you mean because Manny was on PED's? No one defends Floyd's character but as a boxer he's the best of our era.
Floyd making this sport look effortless is the ultimate illustration of his greatness.
The highlight of this fight has been watching Steffi Graf, I don't think her facial expression has changed once.
@Joe_Ha exactly...when you're great at a craft you make the most difficult of activities seem like child's play.
"This fight sucks," every non boxing fan at this party #sweetscience
If you win prize fights by punching air Manny is DOMINATING this thing
Friendly reminder to the boxing purists out there this sport is long over due for an open scoring format (h/t @golfodds )
Kenny Powers &gt; Kenny Bayless
I'd have a smile like Manny's too if I knew win or lose I'm making 9 figures tonight.
@AdvisorSports bottomed out around town at -175, been on the climb since then unfortunately.
@DanielleTrotta had I known that I'd have made you a -140 favorite over @kaitlynvincie . Those NY blood lines produce extra street toughness
@DanielleTrotta they tell me there's a big one but I knew a few places w/ cheaper beer. Toss-up between bigger circus at MGM or Dega infield
@phillygodfather definitely a different trend here in the desert; @WilliamHillUS reported a split of 77% / 23% on the dog about 2 hours ago
@snapdaddyc I cant stand him as a person but the same folks saying this I'm sure root for Kobe, Big Ben, Greg Hardy; mind boggling logic
Had people today tell me betting on Floyd means you support domestic violence; It might be the dumbest statement I've ever heard in gambling
@KyDerbyJay If it's Baffert's call no way he runs against his stud but does Shaw allow him to skip the race? Def something to keep tabs on
@KyDerbyJay going to make pricing the Preakness very interesting knowing AP will get all the buzz, could see value everywhere else
@KyDerbyJay you've earned the nickname yet again my friend. Outstanding work, can only wonder if Materiality not boxed in about the finish


CRAM SESSION: @KyDerbyJay provides everything you need to know before betting the #KentuckyDerby2015 
@SevenCostanzaa @LVSuperBook this is comical. Why don't you ask one of their managers @golfodds before running your mouth with slander
@SevenCostanzaa @LVSuperBook does being an internet tough guy make you feel special? It's called an odds screen and their press release
"We can't buy a ticket on Floyd right now and we're fine with that. A Mayweather win would be great for our book," local sportsbook manager
@AdvisorSports I do. There's no reason to run and bet the fav now. So much recreational money post NBA Game 7, Derby, etc will enter market
@Walanka you're exactly right. People want to bet this fight with their heart and that's why nearly 8 of every tickets coming in on Pacman
Money on #MannyPacquiao continues to come in at @LVSuperBook , line on #FloydMayweather now as low as it's been at -185 there.
@dabearmc @TheLinemakers @PinnacleSports being someone that will bet Floyd here in town I plan to wait it out until the absolute last minute
@TheLinemakers also has dipped that low at @PinnacleSports , rather surprising to see
What you spend on gas money you can save on juice 
DERBY DAY: Complete preview of the 141st #RunForTheRoses and everything you need to know about today's race 
@JayOnrait @periscopeco should I be concerned that my eyebrows have now been a topic of discussion multiple times on the show? ha
Hey @JayOnrait ! They're the Minnesota WILD!!! #MikeModanosnotwalkingthroughthatdooranytimesoon

@PayneInsider @dw7777777 David I also laid -180 that Payne used a few filters before finalizing his new professional looking avatar.
@dw7777777 @PayneInsider I can't speak for every group but haven't talked to sharp guys on Pac however those on May layin the price, not dec
You know a fight's a big deal when there are scalpers asking 10x face just for tickets to the weigh-in. 
FOOTBALL FIX: All the analysis and betting capsules you need from @ukbettingpro for a busy weekend in the Premiership 
@VinniegLVHC could but different market. As a bookmaker 'dI want my strongest possible outcome "Floyd by decision" so wouldnt want $$ there
@VinniegLVHC -130
.@LVSuperBook drops the price on #MayweatherPacquiao to -190 after Floyd had floated between -200 &amp; -215 for the last few weeks
@KyDerbyJay @DanWolken He's a horse you look at for matchups and wrap into exotics, as Jay said 5-2 just such a short price in this field
All the #KentuckyDerby2015 talk is about American Pharoah &amp; Dortmund but @KyDerbyJay shares where he sees real value 
The man, they myth, the legend @KyDerbyJay shares his comprehensive thoughts on this weekend's #KentuckyDerby2015 
@Klutch137 I mean there was high drama for a total that closed 187.5...so there's that
Friendly reminder #NHLPlayoffs &gt; NBA Playoffs...buzzer beater and all
@___RONIN___ needed to buy that hook, who know it would come in handy ha
@DBarraza9 no doubt about it, not all the time a team hits the 120 mark and a total still stays under
If you laid the 3/3.5/4 or even 50 with the Bulls tonight you had the right side...
@alexquigley O/U 31.5 picks correct...I'm sure @BenFinfer wants some of that sweet action
Leonard Williams was an underdog to be drafted ahead of Dante Fowler last night, he's now a -230 fav to go before him at @5Dimes
Boxing takes center stage Saturday at @MGMGrand; I sat down with the man booking the city's biggest bets this weekend 
@tng8r I hope for the sake of Titans nation tonight goes the way y'all anticipate...should be interesting
@sportsbooktom that's a mean looking brigade right there, I'd steer clear!
Crowds really starting to filter into the Grand for this weekend's festivities. 
@PFBSuperDave I think everyone writing a eulogy is a bit premature but I'd agree without recognizable or marketable stars its a tough sell
@PFBSuperDave just read the story, job well done Dave. Def an interesting time for both sports but IMO boxing will never "leave" Vegas
@ryanmgreene I think you could take out the Lion no problem, don't sell yourself short man!
My thoughts on what #MayweatherPacquiao means to Las Vegas and the  man at MGM in the crosshairs of every big bettor 
@Lorioktc @ClayTravisBGID  It's a charmed life you lead miss Kelly
@craigeyles if by 2nd row you mean from the confines of a buddy's living room then you my friend would be correct ha
@MindofKVD most likely the Titans trade out of the 2 hole...should be an interesting draft day
While much of the east coast sleeps, #MarcusMariota now listed as a -175 fav NOT to get drafted by the #Titans at @5Dimes (cc: @3HL1045 )
@dirklaser haha boatraced is the term I think you were referring to here.
Any sports bettor that tells you he/she isn't superstitious is lying to you.
The #Orioles should have just handed out #Marlins gear today 
@jbgoirish believe most MGM properties have sold out their viewing parties. Unfortunately everywhere else on strip under blackout rules.
@PeterBurnsESPN  it stems from all the time they hatched those ideas by themselves while the rest of us were out acting like drunken fools.
@heshsson yep, almost feels like people on social media think its somehow emasculating to give someone credit for a triumph/success
By virtue of their game 5 win, the #Spurs go from a -135 series favorite when tied 2-2 to a -525 favorite with a 3-2 series lead.
Worst part about twitter after a great game is everyone trying to figure out a Clipper to blame for the loss rather than crediting the Spurs
@WhiteMamba420 I just assume most UCLA hoops fan root for the Lakers so they're probably not paying attention right now ha
@Megan_Broadway @patmuldowney unless you can produce the ribbon, trophy, or awards dinner video I'm not sure we can believe you #twitter
I mean it wouldn't be unprecedented for a team from southern California to win a meaningful postseason game because of goaltending this year
@patmuldowney or lost a bet, or said something stupid, or used incorrect punctuation
@EllenByrdHain nothing but respect for what he's meant to the game and what he can still bring to the table at 39. I'm 33 and tired watching
Tim Duncan with a 12 inch vertical instead of 6 would be one hell of a player #oldmangame
@Ike5Lewis If they can acquire 3 starters to win a pennant between now and then I will tip my hat and make sure Cherington gets GM of the yr
@Larry_LongBalls well to their credit it's tough for any bullpen to be effective when they enter games before the 5th every third day
@DBarraza9 not every night but they've been one of the better bets if you blindly bet their games over the total
Clearly this #RedSox team is built for October baseball...I mean with their wealth of starting pitching and all
@jaymelamm ...and that would be? I get that a lot, have to be more specific ha
Facing an 0-3 deficit the #MilwaukeeBucks were 60-1 to complete the series comeback at @5Dimes
Everyone loves a good boxing storyline they think they'll be able to profit from on Saturday 
@RandyScottESPN the man single handedly wins games...sometimes for his own time, often for the opponent
@PayneInsider must be nice to collect that paycheck when you show up in game 86
Halak with the horseshoe...seeing some championship caliber goaltending tonight in elimination games. We'll call them the anti-Allen impacts
@lindetrain @BreakdownSheets @Winafy agree with Matt. ZERO incentive to lie and having worked behind the counter used to share same intel
@michael99000 some books share the breakdown but you'll never know the actual dollar amount obviously financials are proprietary
@BamaWing05 @WilliamHillUS every book in town will need the favorite unless something drastic changes compared to every previous prize fight
According to @WilliamHillUS , 82% of the tickets they've printed for #MayweatherPacquiao are on the underdog Pacquiao (now sitting at +200)
@BarstoolBigCat early on it's looking like a Jay Cutler led offense, Chicago fans should be used to slow starts
@titansfan009 I agree that's the bigger concern but unfortunately history hasn't shown rioting leads to instant change in these communities
I'll never understand how rioting and destroying the community you actually live in makes a social statement
@TelcoAg I can't see Cal Tech not seeking a better bag man to bring in a bevy of 5* recruits for 2016 so I'll make the field -300
If #HeroesOfTheDorm isn't being sponsored by 
@CoversNuggz I mean I'm shocked ASU is putting up this kind of fight. I figured a party school like that couldn't compete with nerd laden UC

Which seem to provide the best? 
The #Cavaliers 3 covers in this series against the #Celtics came by a grand total of 3.5 points
@GL1236 like that idea...it's not like hockey where there's still a slight chance a goalie can get hot making a comeback possible
It's time for the #NBA to go back to a best of 5 for the opening round.
Still not playing @FOXFantasyAuto ? It's not too late to join and compete against your fav @RaceHub personalities 
UFC 186: @GambLou provides fight analysis for tonight's card sharing betting advice &amp; his money management strategies 
@Babyquad it's the picture perfect example of why you can't always judge the handicapping merits of a bet purely by a result
It's been hard explaining to a non sports fan watching NBA tonight that the Raptors were a 4 seed in their conf and the Spurs a 6 in theirs'
@MattieLouOKTC @Lorioktc is the chain smoker in the backdrop Masters marriage guru Rebecca Johnson?!
@VTchaser definitely didn't think anyone would throw those out there...might be 2nd most surprising behind Chewy Sprees ha
@WillGrayGC gets a bit easier if you give chocolate it's own division, trust me that was more contentious than just picking one
@lueker Dove would put you in the lone soldier territory, like the often ignored staple but I'd go Ghiradelli power rated higher ha
@BFawkesESPN currently watching NASCAR qualifying with some of the boys so the topic of discussions tend to go off the rails ha
@ArlissGambles that was actually my 1a, had to pick 1 so they got left out in the cold
Attempting to settle useless debate: If you could only have 1 kind of candy the rest of your life, what do you choose? Went Sour Patch Kids
@justin8n I think Montreal closes out Ottawa tonight, just a steep price. Blues/Wild should be a tight defensive game as well

FOOTBALL FRIDAY: Full round of EPL fixture analysis from @ukbettingpro along with the @petenordsted football podcast 
@Testaalp believe there was some 13-1 out there on the live moneyline
Currently shaping up to be an ugly night for bookmakers if the @warriors find a way to pull this rabbit out of their hat
The Sedins will thrive in a no check men's league until they're 55. However that skill set isn't optimal when trying win a playoff series.
Tim Duncan trolling everyone "We were rusty, too many days off."
I'm always entertained when Reggie Miller shares his take on lockdown defense
@jpwoodward right. I'm not saying it comes without a price, clearly a calculated risk by the team employing it
@RyanFieldFS1 @katienolan apparently Ryan struggles with his sense of time...
@dbeebe23 ha ok, that's a fair and logical assessment
@DavisMets no argument whatsoever there but that's not Coach Pop's goal. To imply changing rules to hide a player's weakness is mind bogglin
@terron_chapman there's no doubt about that...clock feels like it hasn't moved in about an hour
I'm not sure why everyone has a problem with Hack-A-Jordan; goal in every sport is to find opposing player's weakness and exploit it #edge
If you call yourself a NBA fan and want to be entertained throughout the playoffs do yourself a favor and follow @World_Wide_Wob
@ClayTravisBGID can't hurt. Wait, does this mean as SEC apologist you plan to be the next Jefferson Davis should the south rise again?
The Prime Minister of Canada is a published hockey historian...you can't make that kind of thing up if you tried
@KJMediaDarling you apparently never watched a lot of D-3 hockey, physical fitness was a relative term
@deja_knight @MattieLouOKTC ha I've stayed in plenty of Red Roof Inn's along the way, there's no high maintenance in my DNA aside from booze
@irish0625 ha neither. Grew up playing against all the guys from New Trier &amp; Loyola but played prep hockey out east during HS
@irish0625 northern suburbs
@KJMediaDarling Gambling &gt;&gt; D-3 College hockey
@MattieLouOKTC @Outboardmuffin I never received my first class airfare or 5* accommodation, was going to be tough to sell me on the travel
@MarkDoherty7 summer totals at Fenway will be sky high, don't forget yesterday's game ended 1-0. Good pitching &gt; good hitting
Grew up playing hockey in Chicago against Craig Anderson; pretty sure his hockey career worked out a hell of a lot better than mine did
@TheKostos you'd think they were playing the Red Sox tonight with this pace of play
@Bet_Labs is there a difference in terms of teams staving off elimination while playing at home (assume normally the case) vs being on road?
@patmaughan I think there's a lot to be said for @So_Money_Sports NHL playoff philosophy and swallowing juice before the extra period
@Joe_Ha @BarstoolBigCat We've had the discipline discussion before...it just ended with both of us drinking more beer
Betting the NHL/NBA playoffs is a lot like tackling a Vegas buffet: portion control &amp; selectivity are key or you'll end up feeling like junk
@TheBuzzerOnFOX @UNOmaha Glad to see 1 trip to the #frozenfour and a program all in on raising the bar, I applaud this effort
@CoversNuggz @okcthunder haven't seen odds posted just yet on this, imagine the market will open in the coming days
Complete list of Week 1 #NFL openers from the @LVSuperBook 
@VegasAggie no sir, offered by @BovadaLV before the postseason started. It's way too late for me to be smart and/or creative
@TomFornelli  name me one trilogy where the 3rd was better than the first 2...you can have the entire intermission to decide #patience
Congrats to those who laid -140 on "Will a game go to triple OT this postseason?" you can now cash your tickets. #BecauseItsTheCup
@World_Wide_Wob go watch Inside the NBA, leave us puck fans alone!
There's a good chance this puck got stuck in the Ivy
@QuantCoach you can have all the Bears action you want week 1, was hoping for a 3 on GB...not a team itching to play a game sooner than Pack
@Markdawg33 49ers -3.5
@titansfan009 @LVSuperBook Bucs -3 vs Titans
Notable #NFL Week 1 openers from @LVSuperBook : NE -6 vs PIT, GB -4 @ CHI, IND -3 (even) @ BUF, SEA -3.5 @ STL, DEN -4 @ BAL, PHI -1.5 @ ATL
Notable #NFL Week 1 openers from @DaveMasonBOL : NE -6 vs PIT, GB -3.5 @ CHI, IND -2.5 @ BUF, SEA -4.5 @ STL, DEN -4 vs BAL, DAL -5 vs NYG
Gone way too soon...the NASCAR community lost a great man today 
@WillGrayGC Drew Willy is a legend in the prairies...when he walks into a bar there are 2 Blue Light's waiting for him at all times
@WillGrayGC it's going to take a bit for golf season to arrive 
15k+ fans going quiet that fast is an eerie sound...
@So_Money_Sports I saw this game already this postseason...it just happened to be Montreal sealing Ottawa's fate the other night
@WBALDash that might be a 10 minute game misconduct penalty for that remark ha
@WheelerTSN was waiting for an opportunity at the end of 1 but think there's a ton of value after weathering the initial storm
@MattieLouOKTC Highest level of education achieved: High School -115, SEC school 8-5, Ivy League 7-1, PHD program 15-1, Other +100
@Arlo2121 I hate fighting in hockey but it does allow players to police themselves. NBA cheapshots go unpunished way too often IMHO
@GWCapper there's a game on? I saw 16-11 scroll by I figured it was shots on net in one of the NHL playoff games. Now the Dubs...I'll watch
NBA fights are a waste of time...they're like elementary school dust-ups where if a kid gets pushed it's a huge deal #BecauseItsTheCup
@GrandpaKeebs not sure I want to step in front of Winnipeg tonight, should be an absolutely electric atmosphere for a team on the brink
@Darren_Parker_ having taken part in a few Patriots Day celebrations I can tell you there's a high probability he's had plenty by now ha.
@BarstoolBigCat I'm still waiting for the ultimate Bar Stool feature of "Where are they now" with the man, the myth, the legend of Bartman
I don't expect fans to be smart but reaching out to grab a ball in play potentially hurting the home team always boggles my mind
@PeterDrozda far from optimal but most importantly topped the @RaceHub leaderboard just did lose ground on the Fox fantasy collective
@A_Yacina As long as @KyDerbyJay didn't hire Scott Boras as his agent for race season I'm sure we'll have some top tier content
@PeterDrozda my team of 48, 24, 47, 78, and 41 is officially a mash unit just working to salvage something here late
@Justbo1901 pretty sure they've run out of gas. I applaud you for sticking it out my friend, long/wet day at the track
@PeterDrozda wondering how long they'll wait. I'm no weatherman but the forecast doesn't exactly look clear in the coming minutes/hours
@SportsMaximus ha that's not even up for debate tonight
Pretty sure the #AirTitan dryers deserve to be in victory lane tonight
Still plenty of races to get you back at the track this year Byrnesy! 
@DashMan18 @darrenrovell from those I've talked to there really isn't a lot of concern around here yet; Arum still yet to sign official deal
@erikschuman they also exercise slightly better clearance attempts than the Caps, what a busted defensive sequence to close that thing
It's almost as if @NBCSports didn't want America to miss the start of Preds Hawks with that cheddar goal given up by Holtby
@dnel0780 they'll need the Celts early as well but the late night time slot adds fuel to the fire out west
Biggest book liability for today's #NBAPlayoffs action will be the #Spurs; local book told me finding Clippers money is "a real challenge."
Trying to walk after yesterday's @SpartanRace proving to be a real challenge
Golden St listed as an 11 point favorite over the Pelicans with a total of 204.5 for Game 2 at @LVSuperBook
@johnnydee41 think it actually closed 207.  Saw everything from 205 to 206.5 around town here, amazing it ended that way
Somehow this #WARRIORSvPELICANS game falls right on the closing total of 205.  Pretty sure both over and under bettors going to feel jobbed
Devan Dubnyk just made a save for the #Wild that meant absolutely nothing to anyone...except under bettors
@BetTheGreek ha still hope that eventually the Cup will return to its rightful home, somewhere north of the border but it sure won't be GTA
@StevenOlszewski there's always the walk off homer...but yea, ticket looked a little more valuable just a bit ago but still hope!
@BetTheGreek It's always great to send the game's brightest star to a team that's generally irrelevant in pretty much every chase 4 the Cup
FIGHT NIGHT 65: UFC betting analyst @GambLou shares some of his best bets and analysis for tonight's card 
@albee_sure @ufc will have the post up shortly. Had some extenuating circumstances this am
@bustedcoverage thankfully I took the time to edit myself out of any controversial pictures that may be circling #careergrowth
Well this should make the start of the weekend a bit more challenging than normal that's for sure 
@TheBrain2177 cokepocalypse
Crawford has made Q's decision for game 3 THAT much easier...
People have Coke at Vegas pool parties?! No that never happens in this town 
@tsad73 oh there's no reason for him to be down on his knees giving up short side, 100% agreement there
@BigKatSports been in both roles, back-up and starter, and if team doesn't have confidence in their goalie it's debilitating
The last goal not on Crawford but that's a deflating goal for the team regardless.  Coach Q really needs to think about going to Darling
@GWCapper I know you're excited about that must see tv in the eastern conference.
@brentdougherty how does the mayor not have tickets for these home games?
@ChildlessA10 he bears a lot of blame, leaving ESPN was a death knell but honestly not sure how the sport can win over casual fans.
@chrisfallica hard to lose the guy that's logged the most time on the blue line all season long.
@chrisfallica If Halak plays like Halak the Isles will have major problems. Wasnt all him tonight but IMO he can't be pedestrian w/young D
@winone ha no, always been that way just reminding fans the NHL doesn't have playoff series where a team is -4000 over another.
@The_real_Clint I grew up a Yankee fan and think the whole thing is hysterical. I'm all for PED usage in baseball, just not contact sports.
Playoff Hockey &gt; Playoff Basketball
@JRzad7 ...or the guys who cant afford the designer stuff.  No doubt if there's a will there's a way when it comes to PED's
@TheKostos was going to make him a -800 fav for a positive drug test but since the Yankees will be irrelevant MLB prob just letting it go ha
If this is Arod off the juice imagine how many bombs he'd hit if was still on the stuff
FOOTBALL FRIDAY "ukbettingpro: For all my weekend EPL thoughts check out my column for @ToddFuhrman 
@stoupher12 @3HL1045 I feel like a PP blue line of Shea Weber and Fulton Reed would give them a huge special teams edge
What every #Cubs fan is thinking right now: "If Kris Bryant goes yard in his first career at bat we'll know it's our year" @BarstoolBigCat
@3HL1045 If I were to invest in this game the only 2 angles worth exploring would be Preds -110 and O5, think Pekka is the difference 2night
@JoshParcell @VegasSports I make the Pelicans chalk in that series, especially with their full complement of talent finally healthy
@JoshParcell @VegasSports definitely a different look. If Pelicans finished anywhere but 8 in West their odds would be much lower
ICYMI: #NFLDraft props continue to be an emerging market for offshore sportsbooks, even if they only offer low limits 
.@ClayTravisBGID offers his thoughts and comments on the whole Britt McHenry situation as part of this week's mailbag 
Correction on @KrisBryant_23 HR prop: No -500 / Yes +350...typo 
.@KrisBryant_23 props via @BovadaLV : Will he record a hit? Yes -200 / No +160, Will he hit a homerun? Yes +500/No -350, O/U H+R+RBI's: 2
@Zonacats1 @thespinzone I worry about those Arizona educations...Hawks, Senators, Flames, Isles, Wild, Wings, Pens = 7 folks
@GatorsLeafsBill ha that may or may not have been designed to help squeak out the 6th goal I needed to go over the toal
@ChaseRuttig as @robpizzola has said in all his analysis the Jets biggest challenge this postseason would be staying out of the box...fail
Jets trying to make it 8-0 for puck line dogs so far this #NHLPlayoffs
@bobofkake @nropp don't listen to nropp, he's just a disgruntled Illini fan and will continue to be angry until they make the Sweet 16 ha
@StaticLineSal I mean I have printed schedules up in my office but that's besides the point ha
@agwarner ha well no tv exec has taken me up on the network to show just Seinfeld, Friends, Saved by the Bell, &amp; Big Bang Theory = slam dunk
@agwarner why, you didn't tune in weekly for Money Talks?!
@BrooksBets no doubt about it and thankful all games are on however the NHL needs to work with its partners to circulate said schedule IMHO
@wcca23 haha you didn't even need to add the sports qualifier...I just don't frequent CNBC on the reg
@CWofCCH because CBS drummed it into people's heads for a month = effective planning. You don't usually think hockey and go BAM...CNBC ha
It's embarrassing how difficult the #NHL makes finding each of these playoff games on TV...has to be a huge deterrent for casual fans
@MMAOdds I get the feeling you and Pauly Shore would have a lot in common 
@Pregamecappers I'm referencing everything in general. The goal of twitter as far as news goes is to be first rather than 100% accurate
If the twitter community served as jury in any trial I'm convinced that everyone, no matter the details or circumstances, would be guilty
@basiljh to his credit he was making his way back towards New York New York...albeit slowly.
@VegasKJ seems like the practical move if he's struggling to find the bat mobile.
@MeltzVegas well they do say we should never actually meet our childhood idols. Just another illustration of why that's the case ha.
Apparently even Batman himself has long evenings when he leaves Gotham for the Vegas strip. 
@titansfan009 we should see them later this morning. Only 1 book has even posted prices for Game 1, we'll see a trickle in a bit
@ArashMarkazi why should we assume change? We've seen something similar in NFL with 7-9 or 8-8 division winner hosting wildcard games
@JeffGold81 ha all good, happens to the best of us hence me looking to clarify
Updated #NHLPlayoffs series prices after game 1: MON -245/+205 vs OTT, NYI -190/+160 vs WAS, CHI -265/+220 vs NAS, &amp; CAL -175/+155 vs VAN
@JeffGold81 @golfodds on the Spurs if it's that high or do you mean on the Clips as a live dog in the eyes of the public?
Just spoke to @golfodds about the much anticipated #Spurs at #Clippers series. He expects to see the series open around -175 @LVSuperBook
@BarstoolBigCat @notthefakeSVP  it's playoff time, as long as you avoid Canadian beer it's like drinking water...perfect hydration tool.
@ChicagoSportsJD  think you have to, ride the hot hand. However different from Darling's stand point preparing as starter, more nerves.
PLAYOFF DARLING...someone get that man a beer
@JoeFortenbaugh shouldn't you be home watching the Flyers playoff game? Wait...too soon?
Hope for Cubs fans! 
@Metalbill @burlybassist 29 overs, 11 unders, 8 pushes in round 1 last year will be interested to see if trend persists, small sample though
@agorden1 not the same at all, why books are in such a tough spot to juice the hell out of the numbers before taking it to 5.5
Can't imagine these #NHLPlayoffs totals of 5 are going to last that much longer...
@4thlinesports for sure but there were a lot of people skeptical (myself included) if he'd get buy in from a lot of the team leaders
ICYMI: A few quick facts, figures, and predictions for the 4 #NHLPlayoffs series that drop the puck later tonight 
@JesseJacobs77 



h…
PUCK PRIMER: Previews of all 4 #NHL series' that get underway tonight along with my Stanley Cup finals prediction 
Today marks the annual start of the greatest postseason in all of pro sports. Drink it in my friends... #BecauseItstheCup
@ystonewolves don't you worry, tweets will be firing fast and furious starting tomorrow. Also working on a few playoff betting primers too
@steakNstiffarms @BruceFeldmanCFB all of us have committed dumb actions it's just on what scale and how big the magnifying glass
@MeltzVegas @WilliamHillUS it'd be great if other 89% was split evenly between Bruins &amp; Kings, someone over there would be getting a raise
@steakNstiffarms @BruceFeldmanCFB Pot...meet kettle ha
@linkcalhoun will be top 5, usually you gauge the desirability of a weekend in Vegas by bottle prices and current quotes are surpassing NYE
@jonmorosi wait, that's a compliment?
Time for college basketball players to fire back on Charles about his analysis (or lack thereof) during the tourney  
@alenin ha is Jon Gruden coming with the new jerseys?
@KCGill1432 nope, my mom helped me. She's very supportive of her only son
@UCareWhatIThnk yep, @aaronkessler does great work over at @GoldenNuggetLV . Figure he's already hard at work with CFB Game of Year lines
@rpw822 @BigKatSports after hearing about all that NCAA bowl money maybe the Browns should petition 2 attend the Motor City Bowl next winter
@atk825 they forgot that blinding definitely helps...but Oregon combines uniforms with blinding speed not just hideous combinations
There will be no adjustment to the #Browns win total, conference futures, or Superbowl odds simply by changing jerseys. Good try Cleveland
@ThaChoo @JimmySingh9 @DavidPurdum as fight approaches (about 24 hours before) compare Bovada, Vegas books, Pinnacle; it will tell a story
Bet Shares via @PinnacleSports for today's #UCL quarterfinal: 

Spread (Draw No Bet):
Atleti: 24.4%
Real: 75.6%

Total:
O: 83.1%
U: 16.9%
@JimmySingh9 @DavidPurdum only one man to bet in this fight IMO will share much more extensive thoughts as the fight approaches
@Ridindirtydavis ha too many to count. I figured they all needed a home for Easter but every now and again they pipe off with cheap shots
@JimmySingh9 @DavidPurdum the reason you see a shorter Floyd line in town is because it's mainly public on Pac, sharp shops won't budge -200
@DavidPurdum going to be interesting. Books in town dealing to masses will be forced to offer cheaper price on Floyd than big sharp shops
@MikelSevere aka combine/measurable warriors that were mediocre at best while playing for mid-tier programs? None pass the eye test...
@mikehberry maybe mock in this instance means making fun of the entire process ha
@SwollenDome Golden St -8, let the sweat begin
@bumblebeetoona @AllenFromOH I'm anything but a manager but definitely use your pieces especially against their biggest bats.
The #Reds have officially turned their 8th inning relief situation into a dumpster fire only a week into the season
There's one professional sports league in North America allowing a major sports book to advertise on a team's jersey 
No risk, great reward for sports bettors looking for a seat at the table in this year's Supercontest 
@viserov @KegsnEggs Curt Schilling's mobster attire on Baseball tonight poised to give the couch a run for it's money this evening
@FOXSportsLive @TheBuzzerOnFOX I'll take the under, you guys want to book my action?
Hey @JMorrisTV and @DanielleTrotta , looks like @adam1alexander been shopping in my closet. He needs matching blouse 
@Joshlipnick nothing has changed from my preseason expectations, see them right around a 77 win ball club could improve with lockdown pen
@dickiesalvo ha roster of 24 doesn't allow for much depth but the Outlaws did hold open tryouts a few weeks back to find a kicker.
@ClayTravisBGID I'm shocked the NHL made this list, figured you'd have relegated it somewhere beneath Womne's Netball given your disdain
@QuantCoach @bill86753091 that might be the most extensive Arena Football crash course I've ever received, seems like strong memories
R McIlroy 6/1
J Spieth 8/1
T Woods 15/1
A Scott 20/1
D Johnson 20/1
J Day 20/1
J Rose 25/1
on 
@QuantCoach @bill86753091 this will be the 3rd sting Arena's tried in Vegas, interested to see if it sticks this time around
Partnerships between sports books &amp; pro teams are common place around the globe; 1 team in the US is finally on board 
@NaRuagairi most books in the market here are more conservative. That kind of thing wouldn't fly though, violation of gaming regs
One North American professional sports franchise has officially partnered with a major sportsbook 
@Walanka you've all led a tortured existence, I hope some day your unwavering loyalty pays dividends (cc: @DavidCWHaehnel @mattrapaport )
@tordoff70 I truly wonder what a sweep of casinos would yield in the way of former stars both athletes and otherwise
Waiting 9 months for #GameofThrones to come back must be a microcosm of life as a Cub fan...except viewers have faith the show will deliver
@apgripsh no doubt about it, more tongue &amp; cheek than anything the other day but if I can't make fun of myself then I take life 2 seriously
@FinsMike ha I share a few of my picks each week across various shows on @FOXSports1 but most of what I bet stays under wraps
@3dollarbag I figured that there was a soon to be released collectors series but my buddy playing blackjack said otherwise ha
Apparently #MLB wanted to prove me completely wrong; overs today sit at a cool 13-0-1 with the late game pending 
Apparently it's turn back the clock day at Paris Las Vegas just in time for the rapidly approaching fight weekend. 
@dandibley @dandibley Rory opened -150 over Tiger at @LVSuperBook .  Betting trend offshore was about 55/45 @McIlroyRory
@pantrag2014 have not seen them at any book yet, imagine they'll be up everywhere early tomorrow
@gjdonovan @longleysunsport well played, that tweet may win the day.  Maybe they can organize a golf tournament with @MCFC ?
#Celtics opened -2 vs the #Cavs at @Book_Maker ; With announcement that no relevant member of the Cavs will play, Boston now 10.5 pt chalk
@ChrisSahm @MinnStBaseball @bsanderson15 @BSUBeavers it's just a good thing no oddsmaker has to go about setting totals on these games...
The betting public are relishing the result at Old Trafford. @PinnacleSports bet shares Draw/No Bet pre match: United: 83.8% / City: 16.2%
Did they fire all the players too? RT @longleysunsport #Leafs have relieved both GM Dave Nonis and coach Peter Horachek of their duties.
@mattwheeler @wesleyan_u ha haven't set foot on campus since graduation. How's the spring sports lineup looking? (cc: @FieldYates )
I've been drinking, meant '86 
There hasn't been a Boston athlete to let a more costly ball/puck through his legs since 1985, have to feel for the BU goalie
@Thereal_ktex @TerrierHockey @FriarsHockey seeing it listed flat so -110 both ways
To the handful of you college hockey fans, @TerrierHockey is listed as a -200 fav vs @FriarsHockey (Total 5.5) for today's #FrozenFour final
@So_Money_Sports wait, that's not the entire premise upon which twitter was built?! Now you've got me really confused my friend
Quick preview of #UFCKrakow to help bettors find a bit of value on today's card (via @GambLou ) 
Hey @Royce3D , make that #The1 on tonight's late show of @FOXSportsLive
@gburns11  closed 8, totals bettors have long since pulled their hair out and gone to bed
It's time to go to penalty kicks
@JoeFortenbaugh you know we're now in for a track meet tomorrow with opposing aces after seeing back to back pitcher's duels
Hey fight fans, @GambLou is back with his thoughts on #UFCKrakow 
@World_Wide_Wob there's currently an @NASCAR_XFINITY race on, I expect that to be streaming on one of your technological devices
@BarstoolBigCat did you have the Marlins too? I mean blowing a 7 run lead would be vintage Big Cat as well
@ELTaylorMade never saw a scenario where both the Bruins and Kings would miss the NHL playoffs, Celts definitely a NBA surprise as well
The Spurs may have won but them not covering the closing line of -3.5 is big news.  It "drops" their ATS record to 15-4 in their last 19
Really enjoying @JeffGordonWeb contributions to tonight's @NASCAR_XFINITY broadcast on @FOXSports1 .
@paulellis35 finishing 2nd nope but top 5, top 10, and top 10 along with top finisher in each international region...but never 2nd ha
Jordan Spieth heads into the weekend a 5-9 favorite to win the #Masters at @LVSuperBook . Dustin Johnson the next in line listed at 8-1.
@BrianBlessing been absolutely dominant, apparently he learned a lot from the Sunday debacle a year ago
@colewagoner that's what I'm using now, just pissed I have a half baked internet connection pissing me off
@___RONIN___ believe it's an edict handed down by Augusta National, there's no way ESPN/CBS like being handcuffed
I'm glad that by the time we get to watch live golf today the Masters could already be effectively over.
@ukbettingpro @ktw1021sports now if only they televise the secondary divisions here in the States Jimmy's workload goes way up! ha
@ktw1021sports @ukbettingpro Kyle, I'm sure Jimmy appreciates the kind words. Been a real asset having him provide analysis for us every wk
It's still premature to put @JordanSpieth in the #Masters2015 green jacket but had you bet him to win back in Sept you could have had 25-1
@dvond 
@EricLPauly last odds I had from @LVSuperBook listed Spieth at 10-1, definitely a nice ticket to be holding given his current form
@AndyGlockner ha, might want to warn those folks that DFS "penalizes" winner, laying vig (aka tax rate) changes the playing field
@dvond mind forwarding? Happy to reach out to them and get clarification on the topic
@AndyGlockner well I mean if we use twitter as our unofficial litmus test everyone is a professional and can quit their 9-5 tomorrow
98% of sports bettors should approach their gambling as a form of recreation &amp; entertainment otherwise they'll be disappointed with results
@agwarner @DavidPurdum none of the leagues will truly embrace single game wagering until they can find a way to fill their corp coffers
@Razr_dorn8100 I have one of those on my mantle at all times, just for the worst case scenarios you always need to be prepared
@jeremysenese not a lot of value fading the twins right now, laying a price with Noesi not an idea I'd really want to entertain myself
FOOTBALL FRIDAY: @ukbettingpro shares his thoughts on every EPL fixture highlighted by Sunday's Manchester derby 
@Razr_dorn8100 can only hope you weren't sitting on a ticket for both those games
@thespinzone you'll always have Arizona basketball.  OH wait...too soon?
I'm worried about our viewers when @periscopeco is focused directly on @PetrosAndMoney all show 
@JamesCybulski I mean if we're talking international soccer equivalent we'd see a lot of dump/chase and adult no check league breaks out
We'll have no repeat Stanley Cup winner yet again in the NHL #BecauseItsTheCup
@Razr_dorn8100 not sure I've seen a team blow a lead faster than MIA tonight. As NBA guru @World_Wide_Wob would say, "Heat being the Heat."
@BarstoolBigCat can we set odds and somehow develop a pool for all the Stoolies looking to wager on your health?
@jdrigg706 ha not at all. Much like @So_Money_Sports I ascribe the only way to successfully bet MLB totals is seeking out a good under
@Nemo_718 no doubt and need to get the under betting itch out of the system by June 1 that's for damn sure
@UbruiserD I'd love to attribute it to great pitching but I just think it's bad O.  Don't get me wrong, love the early season rash of unders
@lindetrain when I think MLB ace I always thing the Harangatang
Maybe baseball needs to bring PED's back into the game.  I'm all for low scoring/well pitched games but these offenses are legit atrocious
@SwollenDome I'll set the total at 5.5 but you're going to need to lay a price going over that number
Your comprehensive preview of the #Masters via @golfodds 
@joelklatt @ClayTravisBGID I couldn't afford Corona in college. Reminds me of a time at the US/Canada border we got pinched for Molson.
@Mussallem shoot me a note through the contact us portion of 
"nothing good happens after 2am..." Those who check out @OmniaLasVegas might have very different stories to tell
@patmaughan they've gone from 75-1 when Yeo looked like he was cooked to the co-favs at some books. Most shops have them in 8-10 range.
Favs to win '16 Natl title via @WilliamHillUS : UK 8-1, UNC 9-1, UVA 10-1, Maryland 15-1, Iowa St 15-1, Duke 15-1, KU 15-1, Mich St 15-1
Complete list of updated #Masters futures, match-ups, and props courtesy of @golfodds at @LVSuperBook 
@SharpFootball not buying the Wisconsin not fouling story, their rate of fouling went up substantially in tourney gms. Wasn't just in title
Duke finishes the year on a 10-1 ATS run...good teams win, great teams cover (cc: @andyroddick )
@JeffBBurke anywhere between 139 to 140.5 depending on what number folks locked in
Let the sweat begin for anyone sitting on a total ticket in this game...
@SkipLivengood D'Angelo Russel...I don't think Phil has the onions to take him or Mudiay
@KYwins9 I've learned that when you're debating the merits of officials nobody wins...its like talking religion at a cocktail party
Jahlil Okafor needs to get back in this game ASAP; he won't play a meaningful April game for the Knicks until at least 2019
@54KRAY54 haha spot on
If you ever want to be entertained, follow sports betting twitter during a big game simply to read comments regarding the officiating
@andyroddick @ClayTravisBGID @RyanFieldFS1 Rory's long term legacy &gt;&gt;&gt; JJ Watt
@BarstoolBigCat is this a halftime update or (insert any time in BigCat's life) update? Asking for a friend...
@billgullan no strong feel full game. Pace/tempo def conducive to an over and in a tight game could see the foul fest late
@wurstbrewerfan ha, not all the time a team gets shut out and you still sneak over the total. Never a bad thing when it happens...
First time in tourney public not backing Duke MT @PinnacleSports 55.3% of spread and 42% of ML bets back Wisconsin in #NCAAChampionship.
@DavidCWHaehnel I'll make 2 bold predictions: margin of victory tonight is less than 59 pts and the Badgers don't get shut out again
I remember the last time the Badgers played a title game at Lucas Oil Stadium like it was yesterday 
@joshahamilton I think you might be onto the next evolution of NASCAR Trucks if we're racing food trucks mid-week
@spshoot @PattiVasquezCHI @WGNRadio if there's one thing we know Cub fans have it's patience...well that and blind optimism #still161left
@wiseguys103 couldn't agree more. Said I'd look to buy stock in them if they struggle this year, youth needs some time to come of age IMO.
@jdrigg706 ha yea at 10-1 even the parents of current players wouldn't be suckered into a $10 wager.
I don't remember #Cubs fans being this optimistic for a season in my life. Means "Wait til next year" phrase waits until at least June 1.
@80_JRod 
@604club  nah Frank won't be #1 under any circumstance. Will be interesting if he goes top 10 but according to mocks he's not there.
Spent the last hour scrolling twitter to see media members picking the #FinalFour; majority on Duke -5 and Wisco +5, we've seen this before
@KeeneGal well you can always play the happiness hedge hoping UK wins by 1-4. personally think it's UK or pass here, dont get the Wisco love
@AdamCubsFan29 at least there was a no price being offered. I'd be all for hanging Tiger 5-1 if you gave bettors the field option -800
Interesting betting dynamic in #DukeVsMSU : @PinnacleSports betshares showing 54% MSU +5 while a local Vegas book told me 70% of tix on Duke
@TheRealMrACL that's pretty much the limit on O/U wins anywhere in town, they're more an amenity in bases than anything else.
@TheRealMrACL @_PeteRock hard to walk through and see it in current form. Far cry from the iconic book it once was unfortunately.
Before placing a bet on #FightNight, read what @gamblou has to say about today's biggest bouts  
I woke up this morning thinking it must be a time warp if a Vegas book can seriously list Tiger at 5-1 #Masters 
@LoniPolk247 this seems like the perfect opportunity to have @JT1045 negotiate a branding/sponsorship opportunity for you with @TitosVodka
@ThatJustinClark @ukbettingpro unfortunately I don't.  Would love them to use my site as a platform but it's not a league I follow closely
@WillGrayGC @golfodds is that like being the toughest smurf?
@golfodds @llased Nashville plays hockey, man if it's not the NBA or Golf total disrespect from you. Oh, you meant Orlando...
@golfodds @llased #sellouts
and #MLB season win totals.


@revlarz there are a few posts on my website about the specifics from our industry insider under header industry news. They'll help some
@revlarz the ultra short form answer is legislators see them as games of skill, not chance...hard to fully explain in 140 chars
FOOTBALL FRIDAY IS BACK! Fresh off the intl break @ukbettingpro shares his thoughts on every EPL fixture this weekend 
@mpl1184 @fisheee111 unfortunately can't shed much light on this topic gents, always end up getting out of dodge to spend with my family.
@natehask well to the baseball team's credit they've always been a top tier program. Looks like hoops is in a good place but foots? Sheesh
@gburns11 you attempt to take solace in 100% having the right side unfortunately it won't pay if we get another 5 mins
Regardless of how this game ends Hurricanes Basketball &gt;&gt; Hurricanes Football these days
There's a moose siting in Madison Square Garden and anyone with a ticket on the Hurricanes...well this should be interesting
@irish0625 Aria, Mirage, Venetian...can't go wrong with any of those IMO
Identifying pitching value for betting &amp; fantasy will define your baseball season; @beatingthebook &amp; @sporer explain 
@KegsnEggs I haven't read it but did UAB make the field? Or is it too soon...
@RyanSides def helps but harder to predict when balls will potentially find holes rather than a strikeout pitcher who "controls" fate
@RyanSides I rode Dallas LY but worry even if his ground ball rate is as good this season more of those balls find holes (low BABIP in '14)
@RyanSides ha I'm not sure if it's good or bad but I think the optimism about Houston's resurgence is a bit premature, major ?'s on staff
Astros (95%), Mets (90%), &amp; Cubs (75%) are the 3 most popular reg season win totals over bets determined by ticket breakdown at @BovadaLV
Updated betting percentages for the #FinalFour via @SportsInsights : Kentucky (-5) 45% / Wisconsin 55% &amp; Duke 66% (-5) / Michigan St 34%
@SolidVerbal @joelklatt those knots are spectacular...but damn Klatt won't share the technique, makes all the other talent feel inferior!
The kind of coffee table every sports betting degenerate should have on his wish list (Pictured @bellagio sportsbook) 
@SIASport this bad boy came up a bunch only reason it missed the cut was because didn't take place in the postseason...what a legit mess
Still handicapping your #MLB win totals? Listen to this podcast from @beatingthebook with @MagicRatSF before betting. 
@lindetrain @nropp ticket definitely not doctored but the story comes with a caveat...the bettor isn't just someone off the street gents
Tune into @FOXSportsLive Countdown tonight at 11 EST...I'll explain why Derek Stevens $20K ticket on MSU at 50-1 is truly one of a kind
@Big_East I make plenty of mistakes but that's the major glaring omission from this piece, honestly didn't know closing # entirely my bad
@_sarahvalentine aren't there countless pets that need good homes currently being neglected by your shenanigans miss? ha
@govolx he did right by us the year before with Washington as a live dog vs Nebraska (or year after) it all blends together these days
@govolx was right up there. Was sitting at @Cosmopolitan_LV thinking my cousin and I had a sure W, nearly threw up then lost Iowa next night
@ChickenManWins remember the game well...just didn't happen in the postseason so wasn't "eligible" for my column ha
ICYMI: I forced my fellow sports bettors to stare their bad beat stories in the face...and attempt to avoid crying 
@Action_Sal @ATLAHAWKS @DetroitPistons the joys of chasing down lineup information including who would play, wouldn't, and back to would ha
@Adam_Klug @GottliebShow 100% agreement, especially considering commish's stance is he worries about gambling impacting game's integrity
@Adam_Klug @GottliebShow great point. Heaven help a player trying to improve his "fantasy stats" that also impacts a closing pointspread
@Adam_Klug @GottliebShow I'm sure they compete in NCAA tournament pools too but obviously no money is changing hands when they do #sarcasm
If you're preparing for baseball season (betting or fantasy) this podcast from @beatingthebook is def worth a listen 
@ProfessorShine as my friend @KegsnEggs would say: COLLEGE KICKERS ha
@CheckerBDMafia I've completely erased this game from my memory, some I just have built blocks thank you for bringing it back again ha
@cdean71 correct, I remember it like it was yesterday having to deal with questions about the final score but it was a regular season game
@Ptsk @Winafy @cdean71 not postseason games gents, have to read the fine print otherwise we'd be here for months unfortunately ha
@jackry11 that was a winning ticket...soccer totals are only graded for regulation + stoppage time. You my friend got hosed by your book
@theminster5 tried to steer clear of totals...I'm still bitter about the 1st Half under from this years Superbowl as well (had U24.5) UGH
@GPlayerSports indeed @LakerGMC brought it up but to protect Clay's sanity left it off ha. What was the closing line there, 4 I believe?
@JRich3000 @P4PBC this past weekend there was an overturned empty netter in Minnesota vs UMD game because of a handpass, was brutal for O5.5
@Pokelahoma @ClayTravisBGID tried to stipulate just postseason or I'd need adult supervision. Bedlam 2 years ago made total bettors cry too
@SkatingTripods I think if we opened up every criteria we'd break twitter and shrinks would be make money hand over fist on all of us
@SkatingTripods I did drop the ball on the New Mexico Bowl, made sure to specify postseason debacles or I'd be emotionally spent all around
@JRich3000 tougher to come by bad beats in moneyline wagering, had a total or 2 that lost on empty netters but felt like a reach
@VSIdocsports I think the more realistic thought process is that ERRRRBODY bets sports in at least some capacity
Call yourself a sports bettor? This bad beats column will force you into the fetal position under your desk at work 
@VSIdocsports thanks my friend...how'd the WWE turn out for you over the weekend?
@BarstoolBigCat @cWhitey_NY I blame Loveridge for taking a bad shot then the zebras for not calling the jump ball...bastards
@BarstoolBigCat can you make the same claim that Robin Ventura parlayed the Braves run line with the under back in '99?
MISERY LOVES COMPANY...a gambling bad beats column (w/video) that will bring every veteran sports bettor to tears 
@BillM_Playbook @MicahRoberts7 Will Hill offering live wagering for all Vegas Outlaws games this season, at least the home tilts for sure
@MeltzVegas  they all took advantage, trust me the average age in here is younger than a one direction concert.
@IdealinVegas paying admission a different story than all the free tickets they gave away. I'd set the O/U at 5,500 when it filled up.
@MeltzVegas I'm not sure which entity should be trouble by that statement...there's no half price food here so advantage SLS.
The best part of @aflarenaball history for the @AFLOutlaws debut is the ability to make a few bucks betting it live. 
@MichaelTorman haha would you like to include a time parameter as well? I actually would be fascinated to see Metta work with college kids.
@ClayTravisBGID the real winner in this hiring is every OKTC reader...Barnes has Dooley type potential for future columns
@FazzerSports @Vegas_Matty @southpointlv ...and thankfully a liquor store across the street
@pantrag2014 believe the Yankees in 2009 and the Phillies in 2008 were both towards the top of the leaderboard, don't have full historicals
@NicholasDiehl no argument from me whatsoever. Had no skin in the game and agree that the better team won this afternoon.
@666Bull ha was wondering if people expected a Duke foul when Wiltjer just missed the bunny
Definition of college basketball betting insanity: repeatedly fading Duke expecting the 50/50 calls to even out over time
@JT1045 magic
@chriswerme15 @World_Wide_Wob as if he won't have plenty of time in the coming years to troll the new face of his beloved Knicks...
@groovinmahoovin good call. You're the only one to mention this, brought it up but nobody in current crew bets bases 
@Mike4140j bad play calling can't truly be called a bad beat, game was on see saw could have gone either way def felt your pain though
@slamdeal hard to remember any losses on 65+ game European soccer cards on Tuesdays
@BulldogsRadio was brutal...had the wrong side there but not part of the discussion today only because it wasn't a postseason game
@PeterDrozda  Hendricks boys let me down something fierce. Rest of the @RaceHub crew gained serious ground but still leading...for now ha
@MattyRite25 Utah vs USC but wasn't in the postseason...trust me remember it like yesterday having to deal with fallout at Caesars ha
Trying to settle a bar argument re-Utah vs Duke debacle Friday...what's the worst bad beat you can remember from any sports postseason?
Michigan St is a scoreless OT in the Big Ten title and a pair of hooks away (7-2-1) from being 10-0 ATS since the calendar flipped to March
@TylerWyatt_WVLZ having grown up a Demons fan I'd love to get a trio of Quentin Richardson, Wilson Chandler, and Sammy Mejia back somehow ha
58-34, time to revive the Demons glory days MT @GoodmanESPN DePaul has agreed to deal in principle with Dave Leitao, sources told ESPN.
@realgreatwang it's the old sports gambling axiom that you can't win a bet in the early (baseball totals aside) but you sure can lose em
@hoffytime @RoyLYoung @Birdie18th thankfully since he's my own flesh and blood (my pops) he's more receptive but man it's a damn chore!
Attempting to explain to a 1st time NASCAR bettor that getting worked up during the 1st half of a race is wasted energy isn't going so well
@paulstonesports all good. As @The_real_Clint pointed out UT saved 500k waiting til April 1 but what's 500k to Longhorn nation? ha
@The_real_Clint what names are you hearing? Imagine Marshall, Smart, &amp; the guy I think deserves a shot but not a big enough name White at LT
@GarthGarrels have to imagine UT throws their hat in the ring for Greg Marshall as well
@eddyb38 only thing that makes sense, just prefer they let the actual games take center stage not "steal" headlines this time of year
@Arlo2121 ha, already penciling the other 2 teams into the mix without today's games being played?
I know everything is bigger in Texas but really UT, couldn't have waited until tomorrow to announce you were parting ways with Barnes?
@PeterDrozda @FOXFantasyAuto @RaceHub ha needed to get the horses but if Hornish finishes top 30 does the trick giving the scoring format
@Aaron_Torres @FOXFantasyAuto ha have to continue to defend my lead against the @RaceHub team, they're breathing down my neck
@wiggdog you've seen some pros sticking to their power numbers meaning play against MSU the last few, hasn't worked out real well so far
It's not too late to sign up for @FOXFantasyAuto before today's race to compete against the @RaceHub team. My STP500 lineup 9,11,41,48, &amp; 88
Betting splits for today's #Elite8 games courtesy of @SportsInsights : Michigan St 64% / Louisville 36% &amp; Duke 60% / Gonzaga 40%
@MarkDoherty7 going to be very interesting to see betting splits. Imagine UK narrative goes back to them being vulnerable now vs Wisco.
@CrooklynBalla def man great putting a face with the name. Forget how small our gambling community is especially here in town.
@misterquinnbets @andrewssports @nropp @FOXSportsLive always working to get good gambling talent involved
@misterquinnbets @andrewssports @nropp that my friend is an impressive pull Chris. I think I was 9 back then, no skin in the game haha
@rdcldad part of me thought the exact same thing ha...
@Cjk5H yet you take the time to respond...It appears you need my attention, happy to share it with you boss.
Mentally preparing to eat a whole lot of crow for saying Notre Dame had ZERO shot to upset Kentucky back on selection Sunday #humblepie
@JMorrisTV @BenBrust was sitting on Crafton at 8-1, hoped for a better restart but was not to be after Joey's boss move from 3rd.
@jeremyhauer I will not, the loss on Utah +5.5 last night means college hoops and I are on break until we know the Final 4 combatants
@JMorrisTV @BenBrust Ben's spot on; those few bucks are at least good for a few Natural Light Tall Boys ha
@Thereal_ktex @JMorrisTV no worries, always a good ?. Usually there's a major divide between haves/have nots in trucks with cup drivers
@JMorrisTV umm my parents have been waiting on a return for 33 years and still disappointed. Take a number my friend (cc: @DanielleTrotta )
@Thereal_ktex @JMorrisTV betting the Trucks or XFS different because most races there are only a handful of guys capable of winning the race
@JMorrisTV  ha, no not a trick question at all.  $5 will get you a cool $2.65 back, still more than that Buffalo bet ha
Hey @JMorrisTV , @joeylogano is listed as a +150 favorite to win the #Kroger250 today; you taking him or the field at -190? @NASCAR_Trucks
@ProfessorShine @TZ_36 I'd agree always was strong vernacular. Every situation predicates a different response, true statement
@jsilver4 great 2 way action on both games today.  Early indications are the house will need Louisville and then Zaga big on Sunday
@sat112985 ha understandable to be nervous here but don't think you have anything to fear unless ND goes bonkers from behind the arc
@TZ_36 NFL 3,4,6, 7, &amp; 10 are the most important numbers. A lot depends on how you determine your edge math guys always opposed to it
Michigan St opens -1 vs Louisville for Sunday's #Elite8 match-up
@Mister_Dennis will get the carnage report in the morning, last thing I do is throw salt in a wound with public favorites getting 2 window
Duke opens -2 vs Gonzaga for Sunday's #Elite8 game
@TZ_36 every hook not created equally. Some guys are staunchly opposed while others buy onto key numbers in both sports
Without spreads/totals coming down to the final seconds, this tournament has lacked any form of late game drama since the opening Thursday
Well that was fun...having Utah +5.5 and all

#LetMichaelLetter 


htt…
1 Over 5+ Unders
NCAA loves seat #s=$, gives $0 to players
@ToddFuhrman ht…
@GSeaton great grab...but I'm not sure who this Patino you speak of is ha
@GSeaton @ClayTravisBGID Verne still thinks this game is in Louisville, he just wants to be closer to bourbon country
@ashaneweldon brilliant
CBS, ESPN, &amp; Fox need to figure out how to get Bill Walton, Uncle Verne, and Gus Johnson to call the same CBB game, world might explode
@dinkinc @KeeneGal counting the days...need the Kings to secure that 8 seed to add a lil drama to the mix
@JeffFogle stand corrected, Butler vs Uconn
@JayReese901 different floor layout, they don't play the full length of the football field there.  These spots not built for hoops
@JeffFogle and home to the worst natl title of all time between Duke and Butler...
@KeeneGal thanks for the kind words, might need you to teach me the same about the ponies. Been a rough CBB season, won't be sad 2 see it go
Maybe this isn't the best venue to host a college basketball game when scoring is at an all time low...Next year Final 4 totals in the 90's
.@DaveMasonBOL continued "There's also more money bet on just Duke than we have in total handle for both sides combined in MSU &amp; OU game."
"Duke will be a sweat for us tonight. There's already more action on them than any other team this tournament" - @DaveMasonBOL
@ThorLonius @DavidPurdum sharper books dipped their toes in the water at +5.5 and the price was promptly buried back to 4.5
@RyanWags6 @TheRealMrACL @who_ya_got nah, I'm on record saying UK was the class of the field and have no interest stepping in front w/ND
@DavidPurdum we should play the The (insert book here) needs Utah &amp; Oklahoma tonight game, going to be a common theme
SWEET 16: Trends, analysis, efficiency ratings, betting splits, lines, and leans on tonight's 4 big games 
@___RONIN___ @Birdie18th unfortunately it's a problem I dealt with personally while at Caesars as well. It's a huge black eye for all of NV
@The_RyanBrennan I like it, was hoping we saw more public money drive the price up but still some value here
So I can bet Notre Dame to win the natl title at 7-2 here or ND on the moneyline just to beat UK at 6-1? #quandry 
@KeeneGal I do like under there as well, think we'll see a grind it out half court type affair. Running would play into Zaga's hands
@miggytoddbest you're not betting on the Big XII...you're backing Oklahoma. Talent very even and MSU slightingly over valued here
SWEET 16 PRIMER: Trends, lines, names, and angles you need to know before betting tonight's games 
@ThatJustinClark @ukbettingpro no fixtures this weekend my friend, don't worry he'll be back.
@pgillen15 planning to put together a column for next week, always hate giving out opinions too early with injuries a very real concern.
Huge PROS vs JOES divide on tonight's #Sweet16 late games...PROS on Utah +5 and Oklahoma +2.5/+2 while the JOES backing MSU and Duke
@GottliebShow better job within the SEC if you're looking at prospects of winning long term: Bama or UT?
@3HL1045 @Vol_Hoops does Bruce Pearl even get an interview for the gig? Things just got interesting in ole Knoxville.
@StraightftMut @Espngreeny that'd be one hell of a ML dog if everyone's in agreement there given the DD spread.
@whitejf3 I know I'm forgetting some but MNF crew of Gifford, Dierdorf, Michaels and ESPN CFB Thurs = $. Just don't like it in hoops
@jonlustig @LVSuperBook can't comment for them but don't think so. Number before tourney was 1/1.5 and now includes extra touch for HCA
.@LVSuperBook opens Arizona -2 vs Wisconsin for Saturday's #Elite8 match-up
@jphilinaz @Domenic_Re for just 1 game I'd love to hear Verne and Walton...they'd make a Summit League game must see tv
@bleibforth pick 1: Miller or Weber (and mute is not an option) ha
Not a fan of the 3 man booth on college basketball telecasts.  Feels like too many chefs in the kitchen
@kellyinvegas @StardustBook @doug_keegan @ClayTravisBGID ha you mean you remember what @JayKornegay told you last Wednesday? Ahemmmm
@Johnny_Detroit @NUTS_shipit going into the Sweet 16 @BovadaLV had Will a 1 seed win the natl title listed at 4-7
@PoloTeee no doubt, wish they took regular season champ or top 4 seeds traveled to reg season champ for semis and title game
@AdamHillLVRJ @JonCastagnino yep, good call
@PoloTeee oh don't get me wrong ODU better than some conf tourney winners but among at large's no real case after losing in C-USA tourney
@AdamHillLVRJ @JonCastagnino already the team nickname for the ECHL team in Alaska as well. Would they try and bring back Wranglers/Thunder?
@doug_keegan @ClayTravisBGID @kellyinvegas ideal scenario to back UK vs ND was the Wildcats scuffling tonight while ND couldn't miss...
@ConspiracyMaker ha nope. I don't think a super teaser would have helped him out either
Well played MT @ShermySherms I think he (Daxter Miles) meant they won by 36 not 36 and one...
@PoloTeee because they made the final 4 of the NIT? Top 60 team and applaud them for gutting wins vs ISU &amp; MSU but no, not tourney worthy
@RSandersRX ha @SteveMerril asked this question earlier and Jay Kornegay said he makes it 18 "NYK not WVU."
I just hope Daxter Miles didn't have a moneyline bet on West Virginia tonight...
@doug_keegan @ClayTravisBGID def told @kellyinvegas think they can win by 15+ hate seeing them play a "perfect" game beforehand...
Before tourney started @JayKornegay told us on @FOXSportsLive UK would be -11 vs ND in the Elite 8, will be interesting to see adjusted open
North Carolina doing everything in their power not to cover this game...would be an impressive feat if they achieve it
@ryanpwest was hoping for an Ed Cota siting but to no avail
@sweetlou025 I wouldn't feed him in the high post if we were trying to win a YMCA title
UNC should really run their offense through Sean May or Rasheed Wallace late in games
@kindergartencap I suggest car pooling
@ClayTravisBGID not an option...don't make me submit to the mailbag or force @Lorioktc to demand a response for your loyal readership
Hey @ClayTravisBGID , your sons are offered scholarships to Alabama, West Virginia, &amp; Kentucky: what school do you steer them to and why?
@robpizzola @1800CrushCash yep, know 5Dimes had all the permutations available before the round started but won't re-open until E8 IMO
@ClayTravisBGID I knew I should have read company by-laws, can easily see Travis family orchestrating coup from @LaraTravis for right price
The best price that was available live on the Notre Dame moneyline was +131 when they trailed 38-37...the Irish's only deficit of the game
@ClayTravisBGID @tay_painter21 odds Clay Travis ever gets fired from Outkick: 25,000 - 1
@Pottleade1 definitely more attractive to root for UK than the Jacksonville Jaguars of the world no doubt.
@Zonacats1 @toddtischer early indications they'll most likely need OU and Utah like blood but a lot can change between now and then
@denim_chikn correct...but we're not there yet and this can happen if he's a bad poker player too, not just tied to sports betting.
An offshore sports book director told me 3 of the 4 Sweet16 games are pretty balanced tonight but it appears as though they'll need Kentucky
@LakerGMC the audacity! I mean we live in a Puritan society where every adult male is expected to uphold our Christian virtue ha
@adctennis @chitownnit if match fixing is involved then we have a major story but nowhere were we led to believe he was throwing games.
Betting on sports outside of Nevada is illegal.  However, unless Jarred Cosart bet on baseball there's no real story 
@CappersList opening weekend = keg beer crowd, Sweet 16 more of the refined Silver Oak cabernet type (if that analogy makes sense ha)
@npompeo Wichy PK/-1, one result wouldn't drastically alter the power rating of either team
@StraightftMut it's a lot closer than I ever thought NBA vs CBB could be, so many variables like venue, rules, etc would love to see the gm
@BarstoolBigCat the boater has a tremendous slimming effect my friend
@CourtneyCummz @ClayTravisBGID @kellyinvegas this has the makings of a pure shit show...O/U 2.5 of us that come out "alive."
@charliepayne232 @3HL1045 be careful there...public is enamored with WVU about 65% of the tickets at recreational books on the dog
@charliepayne232 @3HL1045 @ClayTravisBGID it doesn't move the line but does add fuel to the UK fire and make me think Miles is an idiot ha
@Bcacc3 ha never saw this kind of meltdown coming but they were never going to present a fair case for inclusion.
@coachese68 @Parlaypro to answer ?'s that no matter how I answer get turned against me? I mean I do love attacks from strangers on the net
@TheRoyalePain who else would Bama target if Marshall doesn't take the pay day electing to go to a basketball 1st school?
@AnonymousGamblr  hey AG, didn't I get your colleague a job in Vegas &amp; donate to a close friend's sick child? Love the personal attacks bud
@Parlaypro I think the stigma that everyone who sells info doesn't win or is a fraud is a blanket and often unfair generalization
@CommandSM KW was invited on, prior commitments precluded him from joining the panel on Wednesday night
@TheRoyalePain trust me every storyline I speculate on won't come true, well aware of those facts. Still don't see Marshall there...
@Ranzington he backs up his opinions. I don't agree with some of them but to his credit he doesn't shy away from sharing his POV
@VSIdocsports @kellyinvegas thx Raphael.  Kelly did great work in her tv debut, thought we had a strong crew of different view pts on panel
Those who can, do...those who can't, would rather troll on twitter
@FNPNASCAR @FOXSports there you go again, giving out all my tips allowing every member of @RaceHub to bridge the gap
@Mr_Groll all I can think is that the general public got cleaned out Thursday and figured they'd try their hand on another game of chance ha
@Mr_Groll really? That's surprising. Walked through there Thursday and saw some life but nothing like MGM, Caesars, or other big books.
@MearlW  exactly...didnt expect there to be bodies but it just goes to show why major sporting events are so important to the business.
Slightly different scene right now in the Tropicana sportsbook than what we'd have seen last Thursday around 11:30. 
@eliknowsall @doug_keegan there are definitely worse times to play the contrarian angle then backing a team like UK.
@DashMan18 @CharlesRobinson @andrewssports haha not quite. The NFL would rather pretend we don't exist out here in Nevada
@MattieLouOKTC above my paygrade, not sure I could even pick out of a lineup let alone name the members if you offered me cash on the spot.
@DashMan18 @CharlesRobinson @andrewssports definitely impacts 2nd half wagering opportunities, would be bigger in baseball games
SWEET 16 bet splits via @SportsInsights : Duke 82%, Mich St 78%, WVU 60%, Arizona 60%, Gonzaga 58%, Wisco 55%, Wichita St 54%, &amp; NC St 52%
How can West Virginia can beat Kentucky in the Sweet 16? Kentucky doesn't get on the bus 
@agorden1 need to dig a bit more there, losing Meeks on the inside changes the game's typical handicap but initially do lean over
@pgillen15 hmm I'll go over. I think we see chalk in Arizona &amp; UK but the other regions will throw a curveball into the mix
SWEET 16: Previewing all 4 Thursday games with analysis, betting trends, and hopefully a few bets worth making 
@604club ha, doesn't mean I won't bet against UK if there's value the other way...
@thomasshaffer the sky will be the limit, books virtually dead that Monday night.  I'd recommend @AriaLV or @CGTechnology_ at Venetian
@604club still believe UK just has too much talent to be slowed down...
@604club I cant see Wichita beating KU. Arizona, UK, Louisville, and I'll take a flier with Utah
@RandPaulie @BovadaLV @groovinmahovin were the quotation marks hard to understand there? That means I'm quoting someone else...good talk
PAINT IT BLUE? 5 of the 6 favorites for the tourney's most outstanding player award all play for Kentucky #BBN 
@coachese68 the 2nd Friday time slot is interesting, both MSU and Duke will get a ton of public love creating house liability late
"...Duke taking over 90% of the action right now -5 over Utah and I expect that to be our biggest decision of the round" - via @BovadaLV
@MidMajorMatt my pleasure. You have a bright future in this biz my friend, if I can ever do anything to help just let me know
@Johathebear honestly think both dogs are live...but OU offers my variance from my line so that'd be my angle as of now
@sraines2 always wanted to see a race there.  @FNPNASCAR tried to get me out there for the chase race but damn football gets in the way
@iambeater you're looking at UK opening in the -10.5/-11.5 range vs the Shockers. Not a good match-up for WSU that lacks size
@sraines2 haven't seen an opening line there but would imagine he'll open right around even. Need to see what prices books elect to hang...
@FNPNASCAR @FOXSports if only I didn't swap out Gordon for Larson right before the race. #NASCARGoesWest was berry berry good to me
@fisheee111 funny that you say that, exactly what I mentioned on @FOXSportsLive last night said pre-tourney OU is PK/-1 vs Sparty
The parties over...you don't need to go home @ClayTravisBGID , @andyroddick , @kellyinvegas but you can't stay here. 
@GregPiecuch ha haven't run it the last 2 years.  Pretty sure anyone who filled out a bracket this year would have a substantial lead on me
Sweet 16 Lines from @LVSuperBook : ND (PK) vs WSU, Arizona (-11) vs X, MSU (-2.5) vs Oklahoma, Gonzaga (-9) vs UCLA, Duke (-4.5) vs Utah
@RobbSilverstein @ClayTravisBGID hey Robb thanks for coming by. We'll be down in the book later tonight to shoot our segment.

I'm just glad @BWWings commercials actually can become real life
I just want this game to end on a goaltending call...that's the only way this debacle can get more entertaining
Our resident fight expert @GambLou shares his thoughts on #UFCFightNight62 
The struggles of @andyroddick trying to figure out his best bets for @FOXSportsLive . Tune in after boxing on FS1... 
@cthorup30 nah they use wax pencil's for my material...that or a whiteboard
Given some of the basketball coaching in the Big XII, I wonder if they hand out crayons at conference meetings for them to diagram plays
Ever read The Odds by @chadmillman ? My interview w/ former Stardust oddsmaker Jim Korona now @phvegas VP of Mrktg 
@phvegas @TheBuzzerOnFOX @FOXSportsLive appreciate the hospitality you've shown for myself, @ClayTravisBGID , and the rest of our Fox team
@phvegas I think the Wildcats win the natl championship...I figure between Arizona, Kentucky, and Nova I can hedge my bets accordingly ha
@phvegas nothing replaces watching games all year but 
@phvegas 2 things jump out: 5 games decided by 1 point and the Thurs success of underdogs (11-4-1 ATS) putting smiles on book managers faces

Watching fans watch a close game. 

@ToddFuhrman for @TheBuzzerOnFOX: 
@phvegas when betting for the first time focus on spreads (Team A +/- vs Team B) or Over/Unders (total combined points scored in the game)
@phvegas go into the schedule with a gameplan. Know what bets you feel most confident in and structure your bets accordingly to gain an edge
UVA listed as a 4 pt chalk for their rematch against Michigan St
@AirickAirheart going to be fascinating to see how the public gets the game but pros will have an appetite for WSU as a short pup
Kansas opens a 1.5 pt favorite at 
Favs have been on fire today. @ClayTravisBGID and I reported on all the early action at @phvegas for @TheBuzzerOnFOX 
I actually enjoyed the 5 seeds holding serve (3-1 ATS). So tired of hearing the 12 over 5 upset narrative every season come tourney time.
@ReidForgrave you already got the dream match-up of UAB vs UCLA Reid.  Don't be greedy...
@JoshParcell @MattieLouOKTC wondering the same thing...well I mean it is a non-con game Bama could actually lose so that might be why
@sasso_eam definitely the public side no doubt but books have taken some sharp dog money to offset the liability a bit here
@WoodburyTownie ha nope. March isn't the best for that but already looking forward to falling off the grid a bit hopefully come April
Correction to previous tweet (
@WoodburyTownie been a rough morning...that was the 1st half number, correct on the full game price definitely closed +12.5
@CBSSportsCFB if this story is about human trafficking, why are highlights of his football career included? Shouldn't be celebrating him
Yesterday sports book's biggest needs were Northeastern +7 and Georgetown -8...Who are they rooting for today? #Valparaiso and #OklahomaSt
If betting buckets isn't enough for you action junkies @ukbettingpro is here to raise your EPL IQ for the weekend 

@kenyadadameen I think you'll see some regression with the public getting a few bucks back.  Don't ever remember a Thursday like yesterday
@nmuballer24 ha I'll say that I'm not even close to being one of those 273 that's for damn sure

@JMorrisTV 32.5 closing number...little skin in the game my friend?
Baylor's not impressed by LSU's meltdown

@the_real_cho haha the house needed the favorite there. Not quite like Utah and GT but chalk would have helped.

@SportsInsights I feel somewhat validated...time to go back to sipping my Zima
@SportsInsights I'd have to imagine betting Rick Barnes on the ML would leave you broke, naked, and cowering in a gutter
is that you @ClayTravisBGID? RT @TheOnion Courageous Man Overcomes Woman’s Body Language To Continue Hitting On Her 

@DanielsYourBro never said sucker bet...just unusual to see the public enamored with a dog from a small conference
Never heard a sportsbook this quiet on an opening Thurs nor have I seen traditional favorite bettors chasing losses with dogs like EWU &amp; SFA
@RSacco_20 @phvegas the way dogs are rolling early have a feeling this trendy tandem later could struggle mightily.
Baylor basketball collapse &gt;&gt;&gt; Baylor bowl game collapse
Today would be a good day to short stock in Big XII basketball it appears

First loud cheers of the day @phvegas come from Baylor getting outside the number...still 5+ mins left but fav bettors looking for life line
Sitting here at @phvegas for @TheBuzzerOnFOX and apparently @BarstoolBigCat is somehow in 2 places at once 
@JimmyBozz harrow out for Georgia St so I'd steer clear. Personally bought out of the game myself.
@steveebrown2 can't argue, always leery of trendy dogs especially when it's one most of the country hadn't heard of before Sunday
Hey Chicagoans, if you're looking for a place to drink and party during the games today go heckle (or fade) @BarstoolBigCat at @joesbar
@Real_J_Eddy a lot of the recreational bettors out there have EWU on the ML so if they win the game outright not good for the house
@Welcome2daPlaza sportsbooks will be rooting for Northeastern in the early game and trying to avoid Eastern Wash pulling the upset
@rdcldad you coming out of retirement to ride those Huskies in morning window? That's not like my Okie friend...
@Zonacats1 lopsided on ND right out of the gates...ACC Kool-Aid is in the air in southern Nevada
@BTRowland exactly...meant to say ticket count getting very lopsided on the favorite...time to put less Bailey's in the morning coffee
Correction on that last tweet...should read Notre Dame -11.5/-12 creating book liability.
Two massive decisions brewing for a major player in the local Vegas market: Northeastern -11.5/-12 and ML liability on Eastern Washington
@MtVaughnlivin in the "old days" we saw numbers much higher than this but it's rare to see prices like this last few seasons
@rahularibindi OU/OSU was a game we had to avoid along with Cincy/Purdue.  personally like X in this spot against the Rebs
@bearinvegas @kellyinvegas bear great meeting you earlier at the LVH. Thanks for stopping by the set, GL this weekend
@NOONiPANTS @SportsCheetah def a brutal beat for those sitting U208.
Tune into @FOXSportsLive Countdown tonight as @ClayTravisBGID , @kellyinvegas , @phillygodfather , &amp; I help get your brackets/bets in order
@Razr_dorn8100 use contact form on the blog if you can, just catching up on social media.
@BarstoolBigCat what number you looking for Big Cat? I'd be happy to offer up a better than market price.
@InTheLines correct, you'll get a better price deeper into the tourney than you will to bet them now.
@JorgeMondacaFOX @DanielleTrotta sports are synonymous with Cinderella stories. Unfortunately for Trotta this would be Miracle on Ice esque
@80_JRod nope...wouldn't even consider making the bet going into the opening weekend, reassess field heading into 2nd weekend
Surprised with amount of articles advocating taking the "field" over UK now. Cats will walk to Sweet 16, you'll get a better number then.
Let us not forget this game 
@GongShow1 @JKtheKid10 I mean I'm always interested in those that past post winners, invaluable skill
@JustWinBaby1982 ha no sir, just hard to watch the team I grew up rooting for along with Depaul put forth such a clunker
@GongShow1 appreciate the pep talk. You available for hire as my life coach?
@BarstoolBigCat for a few good minutes I really thought it was Nick Saban coaching against the Bears...
@thekapman if I thought he was going to still be their coach 3+ years from now I'd make a better effort (all kidding aside botched it, ha)
@tsnmike @CrazyCodie I figure his lackluster conference record and zero progress for the program would be grounds enough...NIT aside ha
I admit calling Illinois' head coach by the wrong name = fail but Illini fans angrier at me over that then their team's performance is gold
@CityHall03 he doesn't deserved to be called by his real name. As @bhunt757 he's coaching much like JIM Furyk would right now ha
Has anyone ever been fired based on how their team performed in the NIT? If not Illinois has a chance to make history canning Jim Groce
Hampton sees their odds to win the national title cut in half...from 9,999-1 to 5,000-1 at @LVSuperBook after their win #burningmoney
@JT1045 @3HL1045 love the NASCAR push boys but who the hell puts @PeterBurnsESPN on air? Wish I was his lead, I'd def take "seinfeld" dive
@CMcMullin2 @SportsInsights not a long term recipe for success.  Public favs are expected but when public grabs points always interesting
@OU_Torgo about 75% on the Sooners, not unusual for a favorite to command 3 out of every 4 tickets...dogs a different phenomenon
TRENDY DOGS: Eastern Washington (+7.5) seeing 81% of early action while Stephen F Austin on the receiving end of 67% (via @SportsInsights )
@604club I figure they'll be lucky to make it to halftime before it gets ugly.  Not the ideal match-up for them drawing UNC in the opener
@mac_n_the_city never been to Flamingo but PH usually does a nice job for their hoops on the mezz event with food, drink, and seating
@JSB_FOX if Valpo disposes of Maryland just be ready when I come knocking for my World Cup winners this summer JSB ha
@BWeixlmann @FOXSportsLive @cjacobsen23 it's a good thing @RyanFieldFS1 didn't try and feed the post, layup line central for Casey
@cjacobsen23 and @ToddFuhrman have you covered!

@LakerGMC ha yes, THAT's the reason they suck
If you ever need a good laugh, click this link 
@nropp is EWU considered an upset when everyone has picked them?
"We know that Chelsea are, by some margin, England’s tallest midgets." The current state of English football 
@the_real_TL @TheReal_gwarner good point. I get paid to cover the gambling industry for a living, appreciate your sympathies so thank you
@colinjordan ha don't worry, you boys will be catching plenty against UK...if you can get through Wisconsin
In Vegas for the tourney? Come by @LVSuperBook to heckle @ClayTravisBGID , @andyroddick , &amp; me as we record live Wed-Sun for @FOXSportsLive
CUTTING DOWN THE NETS: Side by side comparison of @LVSuperBook &amp; @WilliamHillUS future prices to win the natl title 
WAY TOO EARLY public sides via @SportsInsights : Mich St 86%, Notre Dame 83%, Iowa St 83%, SMU 83%, Purdue 82%, UNC 82%, &amp; Baylor 81%
@sportjmc It's too early in the morning to start crushing @fourloko ha
@Mattkrebsbach21 can't pick a favorite as an upset ha
KNEE JERK REACTION: If you had to pick your favorite outright upset of round 1 right now, who would it be?
@mljm1008 I expect to see Nova open -5.5/-6 vs NCSU and -6.5/-7 vs LSU.  Personally power rate LSU &gt; NCSU but health a major concern
@chrisfallica that's because everyone knows it's a football conference first
Strong article from @NateSilver538 on win probabilities by region and why 2015's tourney could be chalk city 
@wiggdog no pod but extensive coverage all week on @FOXSportsLive including live shows from @LVSuperBook beginning on Wednesday
A wave of cash coming in on Eastern Washington (+8 to +7), Purdue (-1 to -2.5), and Ohio St (-3 to -4) all hitting the market this morning
@MattieLouOKTC @deja_knight ROAD SHOW
@deja_knight @MattieLouOKTC  ha I haven't been given a travel stipend or a list of eligible bachelorettes to attend said social occasion
Just watched the #IHateChristianLaettner 30 for 30...must see TV for anyone that called themselves a college hoops fan back in the day
@steakNstiffarms football season doesn't start for a few months, I'm sure it will turn up by then
@ZeeDustin absurdly low 50-1 being offered offshore. Better off burning money than betting into that price.
The selection committee can get by on the "eye test" but I dare any dude to tell a girl that's why she doesn't get a date to the dance
@BWeixlmann @FSOhioZJackson what, no CBI/CIT pools for your journalist types to attract all the degens? (asking for a friend)
@THEBDoherty I rate Temple better than most. Colorado St talent wise isn't close unfortunately but IMO they were more "deserving" of a bid
@THEBDoherty UCLA would be damn close to PK vs Ole Miss, Dayton, &amp; Boise. I make BYU short chalk over the Bruins
Back during preseason, @WilliamHillUS Hill US booked 39 bets at 50-1 odds on Kentucky to go undefeated in all games.
@Yancey1389 but Rick Barnes is a really good match-up on paper for anyone with a pulse
@finkonation personally wasn't that high on the Owls. I'm not bullish on overall power rating for the American conference
Chicago degenerates MT @BarstoolBigCat Bracket is out, we'll be at @joesbar Thurs-Sat: Hoops and Horses non stop 
@tomsey2 I might try that on my next date. "I'm sorry, you didn't pass the eye test and frankly just not a fan of your overall body of work"
"Eye Test" officially has become the most over used sports cliche on selection Sunday...and might be worse than tough beat a team 3x
Temple and Colorado St destined for 1 seeds in the NIT
Somewhere Bill Walton is getting last laugh #ConferenceofChampions
If Dayton barely got into the field, the sweat has to be very real for any Davidson Wildcats' fans right now
UNI vs Wyoming...1st team to 40
@JoshParcell ha or I'll be eating crow.  I'm not one that believes UK can be beat if they show up and play focused basketball for a full 40
We'll now need to hear "ND can beat Kentucky" dialogue for the next 2 weeks...this should be fun when UK beats them by DD
@DiddyVegas @Vegas_Matty lower limits definitely will drive this thing all over the place until everything's official
Will #iubb make the field of 68? Yes -110 / No -130 (via @5Dimes )
@THEonlyDVB @LVSuperBook @ClayTravisBGID tune into @foxsportslive all week
For all those saying a shorter shot clock would help CBB I'm pretty sure in this Sun Belt championship all it'd mean is more bad shots.
@sickle135 won't be quite that steep, OSU power rates better than Arkansas
@sickle135 double digits
@FNPNASCAR smart man...just don't steal my Fox lineup
O/U on how many teams successfully selected into the field by @ESPNLunardi : 66.5 (Over +100 / Under -140) via @5Dimes
@ElTourEvents @LVSuperBook @golfodds it's a no brainer for me, Kentucky at +100 is an easy hedge if need be as they go deeper in the dance
Will Wisconsin be a #1 seed? Yes -180 / No +140 (via @5Dimes )
@dabearmc @LVSuperBook @golfodds ha might want to read the stipulations, going with my gut on this that the committee won't leave em out
.@KevinHarvick listed as a prohibitive favorite of 3-2 today for the #CampingWorld500 . Just for perspective he was 9-5 in the chase in Nov
Available now at @LVSuperBook MT @golfodds Kentucky win men's NCAA Tournament? Yes +100 / No -120
@ukbettingpro I'll officially have nightmares for the next few weeks...thanks for that
@RobbSilverstein @ClayTravisBGID @andyroddick @FOXSportsLive @LVSuperBook the one and only
Vegas for #MarchMadness ? Stop by @LVSuperBook on the 18-22 to join @ClayTravisBGID and I as we provide our nightly gambling analysis
@and_ski93 no real consensus opinion on the game, definitely seen money from the pros on VCU today
@tgh3316 @mah311  the gap has started to widen a bit. For me Wisconsin and Arizona create the tougher matchups than Duke, Nova, or UVA.
@TomFornelli next year ESPN should make Bill call some of these games completely sober. I want to then compare the differences if any...
@LindseyThiry I mean don't be too harsh on them now Lindsey. They did cover and when playing in Vegas THAT's our definition of winning ha
@LindseyThiry actually I take that back. I'm willing to bet the more obscure stories/lessons are facts, basketball history/bias bit sketchy
O/U 17% True RT @LindseyThiry How many of @BillWalton's history lessons are true and how many should I let go in one ear and out the other?
Thoroughly convinced Kentucky knows the spread in every game. It's how they keep "fans" glued to the edge of their seat each night #sarcasm
@JMorrisTV @bobpockrass invested in the 22 myself today from earlier in the week. Hard to pick against 4 tomorrow but gut says otherwise
@JaronCohen1 @GambLou no doubt Lou offers an area of expertise our site desperately lacked...he knows he needs to walk home w/out wins ha
@austinarchibald independent events and that also means pointspread on all 3 is equal if assume that's best indicator of "win probability."
Complete analysis of #UFC185 card this evening and why there may be a few barking dogs down Texas way (via @GambLou ) 
@Ronnie_Mexico ironic that the announcers never elect to use it in a best of 7 series, man what would they think of winning 4 games...
Phrases that should be outlawed in college basketball postseason play: "It's hard to beat a team 3 times in a season."
@Royce3D as Yankee great Yogi Berra would say "It's deja vu all over again" with Kentucky and UF.
@49LEAFS more opportunity to help make sports betting mainstream outside the casino walls. I miss those days but love new found freedom
Give the A-10 conference credit, they "willed" one of their at large hopefuls to a must win.
FOOTBALL FRIDAY: @ukbettingpro provides his complete betting analysis for this weekend's @premierleague action 
@EarsMcHenry been there, venue is outstanding. Doesn't mean on court product across the nation is anything to get excited about right now.
@titansfan009 hey now, my grades in school would have been much better with a verbal understanding. "Did you study?" Of course...ha
@CaseColeman  that'd add pure comedic value to any flight watching some folks "attempt" to pull that off in the aisles.
I feel as though a push-up or sit-up test should be required to sit in an emergency exit row. The whole "verbal acknowledgment" a bit dicey
@JMorrisTV @PhoenixRaceway @FOXSports1  may or may not have been seeking this guidance yesterday...
@So_Money_Sports @PayneInsider he said something about USC &amp; ASU coeds...at that point I realized he was officially lost in the neon lights
@Stuckey2 @SportsCheetah @lindetrain don't worry, NHL playoffs will always be first we can agree there sans argument
@SportsCheetah @lindetrain read an article earlier, NBA product at an all time high. Mid 2000's was junk and had no appetite for it then
@BIG_SMALLS you're talking to someone who spent an hour watching Akron and Kent in a rock fight...Knicks/Lakers welcome reprieve haha
@fisheee111 I'm sure the NFL will get to that same scheduling quirk within 5 years ha
@Stuckey2 regular season product officially abysmal. Far cry from the college game we all grew up watching...how can you defend CBB now?
@TheKostos watching St Joe's attempt to play offense earlier made me want to gouge my eyes out, I feel dirty after all these conf tourneys
I used to defend the college game as more entertaining than the NBA product but watching Spurs/Cavs I no longer have any ground to stand on.
@GaryParrishCBS @DavePasch I empathize completely, it's how I usually handle @ClayTravisBGID when it comes to gambling discussions
@smithers513 I'm sure an equally interesting scene there with Rodriguez for Miami foregoing the layup keeping the ND backdoor closed
@djslybri ah that's the loophole my friend.  Conference tournaments aren't "NCAA" sanctioned events its why leagues play here but no dance
@LucasPRogers @mountainwest hometown faithful are well trained...if you're not going to win outright, may as well cover
Make that the 2nd backdoor in as many games on a late 3 in the @mountainwest conference tournament...not like anybody there bet the game
@The_real_Clint so Rick Barnes is the new Clemsoning? (cc: @CollinsDrew )
@bustedcoverage I know a guy at a pawn shop downtown, finding something close to a NBA championship ring easy score ha
Can we just forgo the "first 4" this year? Picking 64 may still be challenging for the committee with some of these bubble trainwrecks
@bustedcoverage Bill should have held court at @Cosmopolitan_LV , most of the spring breakers in the hotel would have no idea who he was
Tennessee was 13-1 through live betting facing a 59-47 deficit...to say a 20-2 run to close was improbable a fair statement (cc: @3HL1045 )
Iowa St and Texas have been involved in 2 of the most improbable covers of the entire college basketball season; UT in Ames and ISU today
@mills2626 figured I could pull the ole reverse jinx for Pokes backers who deserved the cover, looked bleak with Mr 45% at the stripe...
@mjmoneybets @kdibo83 slower than a Molina??!
If anyone loses a MLB spring training bet today because @WillFerreI makes an error that automatically goes down in the bad beat hall of fame
@Winafy @DavidPurdum serious question in this type of calculation how are they going about trying to put an actual value on it?
Handicapping Indiana hoops is as simple as figuring out when they're going to make their 3's...now only if that was possible #iubb
@DavidPurdum no worries...but I was serious about negatively impacting others productivity. It's that "self awareness" thing I'm working on
@andrew22clark hardest on the teams closest to me. As @mattrapaport knows waiting for the day to praise their athletic program
@BeatinTheBookie agree that win and Duke shows upside...they'd clearly be in if wasn't for that Eastern Kentucky debacle
@BeatinTheBookie ODU was always zero for me.  U of I is benefiting from everyone else around them losing, will be "toughest smurf" inclusion
@vigliaturo Iowa, even with the PSU loss, deserves to get in. They've shown great upside on their best days moreso than other bubblers
@drewdins I'd bet the no, there's always one surprise and with the field this mediocre think we'll get one team that really shocks us
@DavidPurdum SHOTS FIRED...there's a reason I work from home, can't distract others so I'd say you're onto something ha
Texas A&amp;M, Illinois, and ODU (who stinks) making the selection committee's job that much easier when it comes to bubble teams
@BamaWing05 Australian's do it right, their biggest horse race the Melbourne Cup is on a Tuesday and day off 
@MMAOdds @jonlerner @GambLou @andrewssports ha was always taught surround yourself with good people and can accomplish greatness
Work productivity = ZERO MT @DavidPurdum AGA expects $9B to be bet on the NCAA tournament; 70M brackets filled out. 
@jonlerner @GambLou not even close. @andrewssports and I have a great working relationship there's no plundering talents among friends
I'd like to welcome @GambLou to 
@erikschuman so much can change between now and then. Home Ice especially with such familiar foes worth .30 cents so -140 = equals
@JenkyJenkJr yessir. Head on over to the Westgate Superbook we'll be doing live TV from their sportsbook beginning on Wednesday
The #BeLikeMike commercials need to show some of MJ's gambling to be accurate, nothing wrong with inspiring young gamblers at an early age
@WesReynolds1 optimal time to go into the hard stuff
@chrishhowell believe so yep
The amount of time Joe Lunardi spends in solitary confinement this time of year scares me
@CarmenDeFalco @BarstoolBigCat I worry about you both, tweeting about a clutch jumper from Brooks...against the 14-49 76ers
@mattrapaport once the previous coach has his recruits graduating we know the end result...
@hasmith33 unfortunately not sure who logs historical futures for the NBA. Will ask around
The ultimate tease comes up just short for those bettors sitting on Nebraska +2 #bigtentourney
I wonder if this is considered acceptable formal attire for major events in Cleveland 
@NUTS_shipit I'd say only a slightly smaller % than when I try and break down difficult concepts in the betting world
@REP85 agree. Were fortunate to gain the lead and then still showed no fire protecting the slim advantage
Well things just got a bit more interesting at the Bridge...

@Joshlipnick I think Fox needed to make a statement and get his guys in there, will be ugly this year but better long term IMO
@kcw131 I don't think either are a great option...only benefit to Bradford is if he doesn't play they won't take the cap hit
I wish good health to teams trading for Ryan Fitzpatrick and Sam Bradford hoping for lightning in a bottle. You can put lipstick on a pig...
@JayOnrait @JSB_FOX @patmuldowney all everyone wants to know is will Pat be providing social media coverage of the Vegas trip @fs1otoole
@patmuldowney @jaymelamm ha don't the two of you try egging me on, I'm going to be the model of self control
@drewdins @WillBrinson I'd take their history of player personnel decisions over just about everyone else in the league...they have a plan
@patmuldowney oh the amount of cheap shots I could take right now but will fall on the sword...
@JTNFiveCities never remind a market of its inefficiencies, hopefully you keep cashing on the 1st half derivative my friend
@kramasses haha this has the makings of an outstanding marketing opportunity.  Maybe @BarstoolBigCat can put together a proposal
The #Bears deciding Jay Cutler will be their QB in 2015 means oddsmakers can now take Chicago from 50-1 up to 75-1 to win the Superbowl
@JLeGrandTN @ClayTravisBGID unfortunately no prop bets on NFL trades here in town, you'd have to seek out an offshore book for that
Alcohol, regular season win totals, and a heated debate over the weekend may have led to a potential brainstorm 
The other Seattle perspective... RT @thatactionboss No one noticed we lost our pro bowl center and left guard on a run first football team?
@dabearmc of course, we know that takes the Texans to a 9-7 football team almost over night
@thatactionboss exactly...a voice of reason in this hail storm of let's get guys who rack up stats.
@rlag09 as they should...you can make money there where your NFL team winning titles generally offers no financial gain ha
Twitter loves to confuse winning Superbowl titles with fantasy championships: every time a skill guy gets traded there's major over reaction
@markrsports @Dusty94_WWLS @sportsanimal man, we've come a long way since year 1 where the chosen tracking device was a cocktail napkin
A drunken brainstorm over the weekend led to an idea for innovating the #NFL regular season win totals market 
@andymacneil haha well played. The only team that seems to be able to avoid the injury bug and compete for titles in the GTA are the Argos
Tough break for the Blue Jays losing Marcus Stroman to a torn ACL during fielding practice. Was poised to be a "bet on" arm early in year
Making my triumphant return to the @sportsanimal to pick the conference tournaments and defend my title vs @markrsports @ 11:15 PDT/1:15 CDT
@MattieLouOKTC @World_Wide_Wob time to call in the services of a man with insider knowledge of the bachelor process @chriswerme15
@MattieLouOKTC @fleissmeister @_ABSalt officially devastated...
@The_Mike_Miller @Stuckey2 there's nothing wrong with young men (or ladies) around the country using gambling to learn geography ha
@andymacneil  thankfully the kit can be sold at a discounted price now, no longer mandated that proceeds go to a Clarkson buyout ha.
@BreakdownSheets  ha one of my old college hockey teammates sent it to me, was too good not to share
Guaranteed to be a best seller throughout the Greater Toronto Area just in time for the #NHL postseason. 
@MickeyRyan1045 not quite sure but little to say 2+ days removed not quite sure I've burnt them all off ha
@joelklatt @MattLeinartQB @ClayTravisBGID @BruceFeldmanCFB @slmandel @PetrosAndMoney @ItsMikeHill need stakes, we can def make it happen
@Stuckey2 I still wait for the day I can somehow collect royalties...
Late night snack at oceans11_casino...the stuff dreams are made of in so cal 
@RKnight04  definitely helps my thought process and I'm conditioned to look for different things that the casual bettor usually ignores.
@kkbartender  even I learned the only thing you do when there's 20 inches of snow is drink, rookies down there ha
@RKnight04  indeed
@dmarknewman  ha 15 but in So Cal so traffic on the strip
When you put your car in park on a major highway it's never a good sign for how the night's trending.
ICYMI: 5 strategies for breaking out of a betting slump 
@TheSchurThing @adctennis all good. I def understand some people get themselves into trouble. Also don't expect everyone to love every post
@TylerWyatt_WVLZ books hands will be forced. I make it higher however the matchup for Duke is about as bad as you'll find out there
@adctennis @TheSchurThing I'd like to hope most reading this aren't problem gamblers.  That's an entirely different group, you're both right
@jkeeswood ha always an option. Suggested golf in the past but now have a few buddies who spend more on greens fees than anything else
Losing streaks are an inevitable part of sports betting.  Some advice worth considering until things turnaround 
@BarstoolBigCat ha more self affirmation this week...if I was subtweeting your gambling would have read "5 new hobbies for burning cash."
SLUMP BUSTING: 5 things to do when your sports betting hits the skids 
@tng8r @3HL1045 I don't shy away from wagering adult beverages...
@World_Wide_Wob @conradburry pretty sure you guys forgot Langston Galloway on this list of elite point guards
@Doingitrealbig 
@BrendanPGolden exactly right. Can't fault Buffalo acquiring "star appeal" and a sexy name hoping tread still on tires for new regime
@PhilMackey @BovadaLV Devan Dubnyk apparently deserves consideration for this year's Vezina...
@locktreee @vsw226 Alonso still on a rookie contract, this is as much about cap space too IMO. RB's interchangeable for Chip Kelly's O
@locktreee Rex Ryan and Greg Roman ran CJ Spiller's offense? That's news to me...
McCoy is headed to a 1 cut offense where power backs have thrived rather than finesse...not sure the Eagles didn't win this by a landslide
@TheKostos yep...agreed
@linkcalhoun @KegsnEggs ideally Brent would be better served getting out of the football booth and anchoring a CFB gambling show #puregold
@MarkEnnis @AndyGlockner beyond appalling that Oregon's actions are actually supported by the letter of the law in all of this
@BlatantHomerism there was nothing subtle about that...then you could hear the mild disgust when the heave didn't fall
Did @franfraschilla acknowledge Brent's "investment" last night during Oklahoma vs ISU? Yes, yes he did 
MUST SEE MUSBURGER: Last night Brent took gambling references to another level during the final minute of #OUvsISU 
Mid-week fixture report is LIVE with #EPL betting analysis from @ukbettingpro and his podcast w/ @petenordsted . 
@Thisthingwedo ah, yep definitely see blown leads. To the credit of Celtics backers at least they salvaged +10, OU in big trouble here
@Thisthingwedo every night a team erases a 25 pt deficit as it pertains to the spread in just 20 mins of basketball? Not sure about that...
@see_lay I'd say the 31-4 run against also played a large role but still time left
Watching Oklahoma blow this cover is what forces even the most level headed bettor to re examine his or her choice in hobby
@alisonoverholt @Deegley equally as alarming that no women's team is represented or shared findings from USWMNT to WNBA to the college front
@ReidForgrave this is a new form of Hilton magic we're witnessing, let's call it the disappearing act
@MarkEnnis If only the NFL adopted a 68 team tournament to determine a champion Fontes might still be employed. Right @RyanFieldFS1 ?
@CheedroFriend the path I'm on might only live to 40 which gives me 8 good years.  I'll say YES -400 / No +300 by 2020
@QuantCoach well keep in mind attendees at Sloan had to pay to be there so even while dress code was dicey, earning potential &gt; SC weekend
@DanStPierre9 definitely my oversight on properly reporting his official title. Thanks for pointing that out much appreciated
@thegraymatters @SloanSportsConf I'm telling you @menswearhouse is missing a glorious opportunity to outfit college kids and adults 4 cheap
Gambling is everywhere...and it's not going away. Just 1 of my takeaways from the @SloanSportsConf this past weekend 
The @SloanSportsConf is the comic-con equivalent for fans of sports analytics. My 12 takeaways from #SSAC15 
.@NASCAR invades Vegas this weekend; Here's a look at opening odds for the #Kobalt400 . Notice some major differences 
@BruceFeldmanCFB Oregon would score at least 2 touchdowns in that amount of time.
With Gonzaga's struggles tonight maybe Ronda Rousey should be the fourth #1 seed.
@kenkenhall good point, "lamp post for a drunk" my fault for butchering on character count.
Burke: "analytics are like a lamp post: useful for support but not for illumination." First GM at #SSAC15 telling people to just watch games
@alex_blanton the simple fact people think all superstars root for each other even on the same team is laughable..it's competitive drive
Kevin Durant looks as though he'd prefer the Thunder lose these tight games than Westbrook become the hero
@jimmysnakeeyes to his credit he did attack it, just not sure he was ready for the question as it was phrased in the middle of the dialogue
@scottcarey1414 no doubt about it...no sense in being the smartest man in the room if no one ever understands your ideas/principles
Brian Kenny to MLB commish Rob Manfred: "What's your position on gambling?" Cue awkward silence #SSAC15
Hey NFL, you paying attn? MT @JeffZillgitt NBA will release officiating reports of referees' calls in final minutes 
@505AdvoCare @fisheee111 he performs well below basic strategy, I wouldn't recommend employing his strategies ha
A sign of genius in a particular field is being able to take a complex concept and simplify it for the masses...not the other way around
@fisheee111 rather deal him blackjack
I really wish Charles Barkley would have been invited as the keynote speaker at #SSAC15 . There's a good chance he'd need armed guards here
@JMorrisTV ha...more like a face made for radio.
@___RONIN___ different piece because draft, awards, etc not determined on playing field. Believe that's the next phase of "expansion."
With new NV legislation passed, @WilliamHillUS opens menu of Olympic offerings including Will @usabasketball win 2016 Gold? Yes -320/No +260
@Zonacats1 I've seen some handicappers thrive in November while others perform better in February. So much contingent on preferred styles.
@QuantCoach fact....8 years on the west coast takes a toll on a guy. My days of wearing shorts &amp; flip flops when it's 19 are behind me ha
@fisheee111 @sohri no doubt has to coincide with the academic calendar but May in New England &gt; February (of course not by much) ha
The 5-20-5 rule of betting college hoops and how it can help your handicapping down the stretch 
@bearinvegas I believe @EdBemiss publishes most of his as well. Everyone does it differently, so many ways to skin a cat in this business
@mkoci ha don't think I have that kind of clout in town unfortunately but if someone wanted to sponsor I'd be game to make it happen.
@bearinvegas  power ratings are a lot like a cooking recipe: you won't get them "perfect" in your first attempt, requires a lot of tinkering
@bearinvegas  my suggestion is rather than building your own from scratch initially search around and learn from an existing model/template
Trying to figure out why a sports analytics conference in Boston is scheduled for late FEB.  Summer seems like a much better fit #SSAC15
@linkcalhoun just debated googling the actual facts behind that diatribe but thought I'd rather live in ignorance than know the truth
"We'll be high in the Rockies" - Bill Walton. Officially an ESPY worthy performance tonight for #UWvsUCLA
@cappedallday @grammysf80 there's not a single man or woman out there who comes out of that dialogue with complete comprehension ha
Joe Lunardi and Bill Walton's interactions should keep everyone entertained from now until the field is finally announced
@DavidPurdum can we bet on if the proposal gets approved?
@ClayTravisBGID do they teach pointspread math at the primary schools in Tennessee yet? I think that should be on your governor platform
@KennethIrven if you can use the "contact todd" form on my website, happy to offer some thoughts
@ClayTravisBGID @BrandtSnedeker Clay, don't put so much pressure on Brandt community college will always be an option for the boys if needed
@Sir_Ater looking at a much shorter price. Some oddsmakers threw out Floyd -130 way back when it was originally rumored.
@VegasMikeyMillz not officially, medical reports this am said chance he can return in 6-8 weeks physically; mentally very much TBD.
@KegsnEggs  always ironic that college football players can "fail" the combine yet it's something they can't do in the classroom.
@jwayneb111 it's a sacrifice our servicemen make that I can only applaud. Won't claim to know what it's like fighting for our freedoms
Complete list of updated #NBA futures from @LVSuperBook . Bulls fall to 20-1 as Derek Rose is lost for the season 
Watch Corporal Kyle Carpenter share his gut wrenching story with David Letterman; incredible display of courage 
@The_real_Clint dont give away the best kept secret in baseball this year.  Betting the field against the Tigers in AL central = gold
@BobFoltman oh it runs deep...however I've gone on record saying 77 wins should be considered a successful summer for the northsiders
Tough night to be a Chicago sports fan...good thing the city has the #Cubs to look forward to this year (tweets I never thought I'd send)
@LakerGMC sure feels like it landing in NYC knowing the temperatures will be in single digits...if we're lucky. West coast or bust IMO ha
Willingly traveling to the east coast in the middle of February makes the already compelling case that I need my head examined
@LindsayLeigh022 still need to do all my prep for Atlanta. Has typically been a great race for finding value as a bettor in the past
@fisheee111 I can't buy into this team that struggles to score the ball nightly and is awful on the road but yes, I have them top 50 too
Bruce Weber: the coach that does just enough to not get fired nearly every year
Those that bet St Mary's on Saturday that might be sitting on a Georgia Tech ticket tonight have to be feeling a nasty sense of deja vu
@Bueller27 @kellyinvegas Ville won't make it out of the opening weekend...we've already seen that game once, please not 2x in ACC tourny
ICYMI: One bettor had an interesting hedging strategy as he stood poised to make more than $64,000 on #UFCFightNight 
Turning a $2 parlay into $64,616.08 is a once in a lifetime occurrence (h/t @DaveMasonBOL ) 
Last night's #UFCFightNight provided tons of upsets; as per @DaveMasonBOL 1 bettor parlayed it into a massive profit 
@MattieLouOKTC apparently this is what happens when our campus in the northeast gets buried under feet of snow not Nick Saban recruiting $$$
@BarstoolBigCat uhhh this should end well...I sense an early retirement with the windfall of new found wealth
@thespinzone this is what happens when an entire campus in the northeast is buried in snow...apparently drinking no longer the go to
@rdegk15 @mattn2424 believe the payout as per @DaveMasonBOL was $1 for $32.2K
Good work alma mater MT @AP Wesleyan University says 11 students hospitalized with symptoms of overdose on 'Molly': 
I wished for Sunday Night Football during the Grammy's...now I find it scary to be missing the Grammys while watching the Oscars.
13.69 PPG, 3.92 RPG, 3.62 APG, &amp; 53 steals worth of production RT @WHAS11Kent UofL announces Chris Jones has been dismissed from the team.
@ukbettingpro @CollinsDrew nah I'd agree issue not with the integrity but a few questionable calls to say the least changed game dynamic
@Adam_Klug I feel like he missed the perfect opportunity to go with K-ay Upton
Final lineup for @NASCAR Fox fantasy because this is what my dartboard told me to do: 2, 11, 13, 20, and 47 @RaceHub (cc: @JMorrisTV )
@CollinsDrew @ukbettingpro not quite sure that was the cleanest officiated game I've ever seen...
@G2_Blog @ClayTravisBGID I won't say suspicious but there's definitely been a massive move on Birdman from 14-1 on the open to -200 now

@anezbitt asked the drivers:

@Johnny_Detroit @bobbythebookie the key to success never taking a hand off the goalie (wait, that sounded bad)
@JMorrisTV @TheOrangeCone not sure we can find that on the boards here in town. #PuckerFactorZulu seems like it's hard to "grade" officially
@DashMan18 @Forbes @darrenrovell he'd definitely be a better source on these type of questions than I am that's for sure
@DashMan18 @Forbes you think in a 100k stadium all the tickets will go for 5k? Cmon now. MGM &lt; 20k seats, supply and demand
@DashMan18 @Forbes more money here in Vegas. The residual revenues in town blow everything else away in Dallas, tix just a small piece
@GC3oh3 @Forbes they won't be released to the public, will have to purchase on the secondary market
If wanted to attend the #MayweatherPacquiao fight it's going to cost you a king's ransom. Start saving (via @Forbes) 
There's no better way to cap the #Daytona500 than with a dartboard, no seriously. Right @fs1otoole ? 
Updated #MayweatherPacquiao line from @LVSuperBook : 

Pacquiao      +225
Mayweather  -265
 
OVER        11.5    -300
UNDER     11.5    +250
@JMorrisTV @NASCAR @RaceHub @DanielleTrotta you want to set odds on my performance against anyone else? I'm always looking for a side bet ha
Looking to add some excitement to @NASCAR season? Compete in Fox Fantasy racing against myself and our @RaceHub team 
@joelklatt ha all good but @ClayTravisBGID might be homeless.  Appears Jameis Over 4.82 is safe
Mariota's top 40 yard dash time 4.52...closing line O/U at @BovadaLV was 4.51
@luxhomeguy hard to watch Boone try and throw the ball into tight windows. Carden hasn't looked crisp either, carryover from UF bowl game
Watching some of these QB's throw at the combine I'm having flashbacks to college football bets lost and it's starting to make sense
Quick gambling preview of the #Daytona500... When it comes to plate racing employing "unorthodox" methods a must 
@SwollenDome spoke to the revenue managers, $189 a night with 2 night minimum. Attractive coeds can trim that figure down to $59 per #adjust
@wjeremy97 believe current rate is less than $800 a night right now...at least that's what people are reporting haven't confirmed
@TheSchurThing needed to do that before a formal announcement was made, could have doubled your money already
@Vegas724 believe @WynnLasVegas had every permutation of derby horses and fighter last year. Imagine they'd look to offer again
All about the early market entry... RT @timdahlberg Two--night minimum in cheapest room at MGM Grand fight weekend is $1,231
I've watched @NASCAR , @NASCAR_XFINITY , &amp; @NASCAR_Trucks for a while but I'm still waiting for a Rabbi to issue the invocation just once
@snitty910 ha we'll see what happens. Working on a few things but most likely will watch from the confines of home, beers are cheaper
@snitty910 yep wait if the goal is to bet the favorite, public will come in on the dog
Good to see my ole frat from the @wesleyan_u days making headlines in a very interesting fashion 
@deja_knight believe side "piece" is the less derogatory term ha

FUTBOL FRIDAY: Full fixture report for @premierleague weekend from @ukbettingpro including a podcast w/ @petenordsted 
@VegasMikeyMillz typically available on Tuesdays, not every day during the regular season
@JMorrisTV I believe 2:45 might be an upgrade from the end of the year. Figured I'd offended you and @DanielleTrotta somehow ha
@queers4gears if you're looking for props here in town the best bet will be @LVSuperBook or @WilliamHillUS
@sraines2 @NASCAR thanks man. Trying to do more and more gaming coverage on FS Live. We also hit Let It Ride on @RaceHub all season
@dvond I would have loved to be in their meetings going "Well the Knicks shut down Melo, we need to be more aggressive in this arms race."
The #76ers also angling to be the first team in NBA history to have a negative power rating for oddsmakers
@bmitchelf no unforeseen possible...unless the commish decides to add games to the Knicks schedule the under is in the bank
The 76ers just gave hope to anyone sitting on an U16.5 regular season wins ticket...
@BigLuke42 I think I've exhausted that speech unfortunately. I'm beginning to sound like a broken record.
@ryanmrust ...and it's an hour of my life I'll never get back but because I'm a glutton for punishment I'm still glued to the set.
@Aaron_Torres  I figure a round robin tournament with 8 teams would suffice this year.
@gschrage  tweet of the night
Anyone who watches college basketball on a nightly basis and believes the tourney field should be expanded past 68 needs their head examined
Duke opens -3 with a total of 83 at @BetCRISIntl for the 2nd half #DukevsUNC
A Guy's Take on #50ShadesOfGrey via @Aaron_Torres 
@jorcubsdan the mountain west would beg to differ
The only coach in college athletics that believes this is good effort on the defensive end from UNC tonight might be Larry Fedora
@ass_bandits always in action. UTSA +10.5 vs Western Kentucky in November was pretty ugly. Roadrunners dropped that game 45-7
There were 12,774,988 CFB bets documented by @SportsInsights this season: here's a list of the 20 most bet games 
@ass_bandits largest margin of defeat? I've had plenty of clunkers ha
@snitty910 will look in the folks from @SportsInsights who were gracious enough to share the data for the article
The college football national championship was not the most bet on college football game of the season 
@jwolb88 a lot of people must share that same sentiment hence them needing cologne to remind us all they still exist.
@_ChiLadelphia_ ha definitely did but figured modern day millenials or whatever the hell the next generation's called had better taste.
Walked by an Abercrombie and it stunk like cheap cologne for a 200 foot radius. Had no idea that was still a good marketing strategy in '15.
Complete list of #NFLCombine props courtesy of @DaveMasonBOL 
.@DaveMasonBOL sets the O/U on @richeisen 40 yard dash time at this year's combine (will run Sunday) at 6.08 seconds (h/t @RichEisenShow )
@therealballgame Providence still have a team?
Thx to the overwhelming amount of people interested in the part time job posted. Will do my best to respond to all of you in a timely manner
@Walanka I think you're over qualified although I'm not quite sure a few extra bucks wouldn't help support that growing son of yours
@asproskoupidi yep, there's pay for the part time work...only a few hours a week
@RotoChronicle part time work and can be done remotely
@Stuckey2 you might be over qualified (maybe) and it has nothing to do with women's tennis so figured it wouldn't be of interest ha
@InsideTheBlock part time, only a few hours a week
FOR HIRE: Looking for someone w/ strong math background &amp; knowledge of excel for sports driven data entry position 
BACHELOR PROP: Sports blogger @World_Wide_Wob asked out @jadelizroper earlier 
@govolx may take some work, let me see what I might be able to uncover
@KevinKB28 part of it but also current form and believe PSG had a rash of injuries in their Ligue game over the weekend too
CHALK TALK: Both @ChelseaFC &amp; @FCBayern commanding 80% of the spread action for their respective UCL fixtures today (via @PinnacleSports )
@pghshawn ha only in the WHL...NHL at least gives him a 5 minute penalty
@kevinrleyland played college hockey...seen much worse out there as well at the D-1 level. Not saying to ignore but full season susp? Cmon
I'm amazed at the kind of widespread dialogue a sucker punch in college hoops can create.  The #NHL just calls that a 10 minute misconduct
@theBIGbad_OD @BarstoolBigCat him &amp; Michaels are the originators of getting the number into every broadcast, huge boon for us in the desert
@bearinvegas @LVSuperBook I'm not sure you'll ever be able to get true odds on the Cubs to win the World Series. CWS much different story...
MLB win totals comparison from @LVSuperBook and @BovadaLV 
@fisheee111 know a few pretty well respected groups came in that way.
@MidAmSportsX @KennyD53 well played guys
Eventually the ACC might want to consider the "First to 50 rule" in some of their games. If it works at the YMCA it can work in conference
@IsaacsonTI haha somewhere out there NBA diehard @World_Wide_Wob is grimacing with the thought
@ClayTravisBGID @ZieglerFrank @Espngreeny just a matter of time before every sports personality sees the merit in natl legalization IMO
This is the stuff gambling dreams are made of...sweating a cover in the All Star game
@FreddieJ582  I've said my number is very different on Cubs than market but win totals more indicative of true expectation than future mrkt
Notable #MLB reg season win totals from @LVSuperBook : Nats 94, Dodgers 93.5, Halos 88.5, Cards 88, Red Sox 84.5, Cubs 82.5, Yankees 81.5
@jw_mike appreciate it. Time will tell and if I lose the bet it won't be the first time I've been wrong in a sports prediction I make
@jw_mike you mean the fact that it's the handicap number I made? I'll gladly be betting under the inflated tag the market is offering
Every time I watch Northwestern basketball I'm reminded of the NCAA campaign that most athletes are going pro in something other than sports


@thebulldogWS @USARugby won't claim to follow it year round but definitely love the annual Vegas stop. Bummed I didn't go out there today
If you've never watched #RugbySevens before flip over to NBC. Best part about it all games are just 14 minutes long @USARugby
@BigDogwdae well there's the argument those two make themselves look bad every time they put on their pads...
@pointshaving I love Doc...but saying Fleury and Crawford are 2 of the best goalies in the league just took him down a peg ha
The shootout display right now at the United Center is at another level #PITvsCHI
@smurfthe1 beyond abysmal...agree completely
@JT1045 @MickeyRyan1045 there were no qualifying match-ups available given the group style qualifying. Trust me, I'm a little bit salty
In the least surprising news of the day Jeff Gordon will be on the pole for #DAYTONA500 . Just salty I couldn't bet my qualifying matchups
@ProfessorShine interesting philosophy that those striving for industry change or honesty elect the use of an alias, seems counter-intuitive
@ProfessorShine @nytimes yet the irony in trolling is most dont have the "courage" to do under their real name or picture...says something
@wiseguys103 know the total has become so inflated lately across most sports all star games unders beginning to make a lot more sense
Epidemic of Facelessness: A growing concern on Twitter addressed by the @nytimes Stephen Marche yesterday 
"I'd rather play Russian Roulette than bet #NASCAR at a restrictor plate track" - my buddy's response on if he had action at Daytona.
@KeeneGal that's ambitious travel...better gas up the private jet. Maybe @mikewilkening would offer to take us on his
@kkbartender those are the kind of bets made in beer...and not that fancy craft microbrew crap but good ole fashioned light domestic stuff
Odds on #PacquiaoMayweather living up to expectations: NO -2000 / Yes +1375...and we'll all watch it no matter what. Well played boxing
@patrickkeogan that my friend is the better question and right on point
The Cincinnati / Tulane game is not suitable for viewing
@Duff1512 well he's the only other guard in the discussion IMO. Still think Okafor goes #1 but def don't see it as a no brainer now
@LuckyLu777 what guards do you see going ahead of him? Always curious to get other takes on the situation
@CharlieWisco @ryenarussillo haha thinking the same thing at the same time. Honestly think in guard oriented game it makes a world of sense
It may be blasphemous but the more I watch D'Angelo Russell I'm convinced #NBA teams will have a major dilemma at #1 between him &amp; Okafor
@QuintinWise only FA cup this weekend, we gave @ukbettingpro the weekend off for good behavior
@MattieLouOKTC @Sara_Walsh @FieldYates I'm sure @wesleyan_u would be thrilled to see 2 of their sports broadcasting alums going this route
@thespinzone @Telly2Putts I don't think it's a LV thing but more for large tournaments. Often times just betting a future offers more value
@doug_keegan you'll be able to find angles mainly because the bases lines won't be accurately able to incorporate the pitching rotation
@3HL1045 well...they only need to win by 7 if you catch my drift
@IowaSkyler @TrevRogersBets maybe @DarrenHeitner meant 49% as much in entry fees ($304M DK entry fees / $621M FD entry fees= 49%)
@IowaSkyler running it by the article's author now, will get back to you with clarification shortly
@doug_keegan you may see a couple offshores test the waters here for low limits but don't see it being a major growth market just yet
@Mr_MacDougall I think there's potential for both to thrive. They cater to slightly different market segments and $ for both to co-exist
@hirtme looping in the author @TrevRogersBets for his take
Daily fantasy BOOMING!  An industry insider speculates on what's next for the 2 biggest players in the current market 
DraftKings revenue exploded from $2.5M in Q4 2013 to $17M in Q4 2014 but they actually lost market share... 
@causalatet1845 reserve and comfortable during March Madness is tough. I'd encourage you to explore @Cosmopolitan_LV Hops and Hoops event
@billbarnwell judging by what I've seen from the analytics on how Charles plays blackjack at least he lives by his own unfounded argument
@MitchMossRadio @ryanmgreene same boat. The one thing that scares me having walked that area is the logistics, getting to arena = nightmare
@MitchMossRadio I expect both you and @ryanmgreene have already put down your season ticket deposits to help our cause...
@celebrityhottub sold
@celebrityhottub well that or star in Hot Tub Time Machine 3 when the time is right.
@AJBlackstone12 @adrewdangerward @PayneInsider appreciate the kind words my friend, we're always trying to help whenever possible
FIXTURE REPORT: @ukbettingpro offers his thoughts on the full @premierleague mid-week slate 
Shout out to @notthefakeSVP for making 100% sure the casual ESPN viewer knew @UConnWBB beating @GamecockWBB wasn't an upset #wellplayed
@ksujlack been there before watching Bruce Weber having grown up an Illinois fan. Don't wish his coaching style on any top tier program ha
@jz0524 enjoyed watching him run the program at Illinois too. Not the guy to win titles but a guy that builds very good squads annually
Every time I watch an OU game it makes me miss Lon Kruger days at UNLV...he recruited players that actually got better while on campus
Oddsmakers are under increased pressure to create new markets for casual bettors. @nickgoff79 explains the challenges 
@Yancey1389 couldn't set a price but sent in my deposit for season tickets earlier this week. Can't wait to see the Oilers &amp; Flames 3x each
@scootjackson if more and more states see revenue potential from legalized sports wagering it will get more difficult to slow the momentum
State rep Phyliss Kahn is making a push to be the 1st lady of sports gambling in Minnesota (h/t @scootjackson ) 
There is more pressure put on oddsmakers by PR &amp; marketing departments to offer a lot more betting markets now 
MARKETING: My interview with @nickgoff79 of @Coral betting shops about the changing face of bookmaking in the UK 
@fisheee111 I fought not too but the caveat here is that we only had totals available for the World Cup, never during UCL or EPL matches
@tgiles17 haha let's hope not, pet peeve numero uno with sportscasting
@ShawnHelin game tonight well above my pay grade ha. Given the experience and HCA edge here I'd lean towards laying the lumber w/Uconn
.@LVSuperBook hangs @UConnWBB as 11.5 point favorites against @GamecockWBB for tonight's showdown in Storrs. Total is set at 134.5
@zmulherin we should see them as early as next week. I can't recall exact date but believe that's what @LVSuperBook told @DavidPurdum
@the__muppet know there's been a massive move towards Birdman for best picture and in other associated markets
@RyanFieldFS1 @ClayTravisBGID sore subject...lost on Beyonce with that Beck nonsense. Was able to cash Sam Smith O3.5 pieces of hardware
Fine work from @RyanFieldFS1 navigating through #LetItRide Bad beats of the week on @FOXSportsLive . There's a little gambler in all of us
@ESPNAbrams @StanfordSteve82  believe one of the offshores opened Uconn -10 but can't remember which shop.
@nascar4_rob  always counting the days to Daytona to start the season...and then until Atlanta so we can start betting it.
@TheBettingBoys then all bets are off...ha
@Etoft21  it's funny that you ask because I've tried to track down for years. Going to ask around later and will share if I find out.
Everyone tweeting about the #GRAMMYS makes me miss Sunday Night Football even more than I thought possible.
@notthefakeSVP we can only work with researchers and social media folks at our respective networks one point spread at a time
Upset as 6.5 pt chalk RT @ESPNCBB Upset complete! Iowa takes down No. 17 Maryland, 71-55. Terrapins suffer just its fifth loss of the season
Amid speculation of insider info amid wave of max bets on #Beyonce for album of the year, @Sportsbook_com pulls market off board #GRAMMYs
@bstatz @jorcubsdan @WesReynolds1 my thought is always if it's how you'd normally run your offense stick to it, if not don't change
@bstatz that was going to be my next question...but as @WesReynolds1 and @jorcubsdan know anything is possible with Crean diagramming things
@jbcincy512 never coached a late game situation but always thought it made sense with MAX 5, i'd lean closer to 3 ticks personally
@c__miller and you want to give Michigan free points at the line with 9 seconds? With under 3 it makes sense not in that spot
I'm not sure what Clark Kellogg was thinking claiming you foul with roughly 9 seconds to go...against a team that has limited weaponry
@nickgoff79 @richardajkeys prophetic gents ha
@FNPNASCAR please don't spam twitter with this...I'm not sure we can handle it bud ha
Hey @FOXSportsLive , think we found THE 1 with Cheikhou Kouyate's goal for @whufc_official
@MattyJamesH @fisheee111 yep, my feed is always littered with me talking about winners and patting myself on the back. Good talk boss
Valuable lesson for aspiring sports bettors RT @fisheee111 Those with the most success speak the least
@kaitlynvincie tick tick tick tick. Offseason has gone on long enough KV...ha
@GaryParrishCBS plenty of sports bettors out there see no problem in this unique talent
@MattieLouOKTC that's like me asking you if SEC football players go to class... questions we both knew the answer to before asking
I wonder if @MapleLeafs fans considered storming the ice tonight
@604club 98% of the industry gets their start as a ticket writer before football season. That'd be my best suggestion to launch a career
@evanjobst which statement? My bad if I missed something in translation
@_mbluther @ChopCulture you'll never hear me bad mouth anything UVA does...Bennett gets Hoos to play to their strengths, it's impressive
@_mbluther well I think the athletes are the same but there's very little team basketball from power conferences with so many 1 and dones
@_mbluther said that at the beginning of the year and was vilified for it. It's hard to watch on a nightly basis
@bagsby32 normally a team going 10+ mins without a point means your bet is cooked but in this case, still more than a fighting chance ha
From 8 hours ago...10:33 w/out a pt will do that RT @MarkEnnis I predict Louisville either wins or is held to 29 points tonight.
I know it's good defense but watching Louisville vs Virginia side by side with Harvard vs Yale is making my eyes bleed
@GottliebShow haha you can't go that low because of "perception" and every casual bettor looking to go over but realistically around 109
@BarstoolBigCat I think I saw that dude at your birthday celebration...
@matteneff you've already seen markets adjust. First 5 innings used to mirror full game but books adjusted when bettors aimed to avoid pens
@bstatz watched the end of the BC/UNC game with a buddy who little to say felt jobbed holding a BC ticket in the closing stages.
@russgoldich however I was always taught grade the merits of a wager in CBB over first 38 mins, last 2 mins always subject to variance
@russgoldich that implies that playing the last 2 minutes with a bet on Kentucky compared to say Miss St is equal. Disagree 100% on that
@matteneff there are but it's not universal. More and more pros play halftime angles but limits are lower preventing strength of position
@willybalters no doubt about it and the better you are the more bad beats because you're in more hands/games late
I'm convinced sports betting theory "bad beats even out" is a fallacy. Pros often find themselves on inferior teams that can't finish strong
@S_Gauthaman nothing strong. My power numbers make Kentucky a bit steeper favorite but respect the HCA for UF in this spot too much.
Well that was an impressive finish from St Bonaventure...
@JFarley31 tight number. Gun to head would lay it with UVA, think they're more dynamic offensively and could hold Ville's offense in check
@Fran_Smythe21 nothing wrong with a 3-2 day if you have it brewing my friend, GL with your bets
@knucklesjak have to keep this industry lite. Gambling isn't life or death &amp; those that think it is need to re-evaluate. Always my stance
@JMorrisTV I just called around, we still didnt win that bet
If you happened to bet Texas Tech +18.5 or ND +9.5 today then you had the wrong side. Thankfully you don't need to pay your bookie double
@Paydaypicks I usually look at it as anyone who derives a portion of their income from sports betting. No iron clad definition
@astrosfan75956 money management is key but there are pros much more willing to take risks and go belly-up
Learn to keep realistic expectations as a sports bettor. If you're doing this as as a form of entertainment, always stay within your means
@cthibod ha I usually work from the home office. Need to be surrounded by all my tools to make informed bets. Seeking suggestions in LV?
@linkcalhoun nah, house rules usually stipulate the decision made in the ring on fight night is final.
@sharpedgepicks @FAN590 I believe all the smart decision makers are pumping money into Toronto FC instead, better prospects for a title.
Credit to @FAN590 for taking shots at the Leafs via email messages... headline reads "Death, Taxes, and Leafs lose 4-1"
@trevorkane24 ha indeed pros on both sides but at different numbers. Knicks +7 and Golden St +1/PK/-1
@chadkirkegard always plenty of shenanigans to be found in this town. All depends on what kind of trouble you're in the market for finding
FUTBOL FRIDAY: @ukbettingpro gives you everything you need to know for a busy weekend of #EPL wagering 
@wurstbrewerfan 60-1 as of Monday at @LVSuperBook
Can only hope Rece knows his gambling lingo MT @JimMiller Come this fall, @ESPN_ReceDavis will replace @cbfowler on @CollegeGameDay
@DavidPurdum @reviewjournal brilliant move to step down rather than endure restructuring knowing financial security is a non issue
@Zonacats1 nah, not at all. Very valid point and it's why the world's sharpest betting groups attack NFL over WNBA because of limits.
@Zonacats1 great point and clearly an omission on my post. Correlation between where oddsmakers allocate time to most popular sports.
Every sports betting market isn't created equally...a few thoughts on why books take bigger bets in certain sports 


@Wagermindz no doubt and carries himself with class
With performances like this Steph Curry's going to turn my Anthony Davis MVP bet into nothing more than a donation
@Aaron_Torres  I mean I figure there are a few UCONN alums who might need this kind of coaching if they didn't get it in Storrs ha
@KevinBitter I think it's more an indictment of the school than individual, would hope the guys not going pro at least find a productive AVE
How to lose a job offer in 10 minutes: 
@MattieLouOKTC damn right...I wish I got paid 6 figures to go to college instead of having to pay the 6 myself
@harrisonmarkey why? If we want transparency at least make some of the information public...they're all collecting cash why not share
Next year when #NationalSigningDay wraps up I'd prefer to see which incoming class cost the most rather than the Rivals rankings #payforplay
@WestCoastMacero model seems to work just fine throughout the UK and Australia.  Plenty of folks have no issues posting up their cash
Listening to @ClayTravisBGID proselytize America on @FOXSportsLive about the merits of legalized wagering made me feel like a proud parent
@chaz1121 problem was they turned the damn thing over to ever let me cash one of those ha
@ADangerE for a second I thought it was a back court of Driskell and Harris out there
Florida's offense looks a lot like Vanderbilt's football team did all fall when it comes to generating offense.
@MattieLouOKTC @patmuldowney  it's like the whole outside world has been let into the inner circle...
@BTepper24 @BovadaLV I;m out of my element here even attempting to offer an educated opinion on the Grammy's unfortunately ha

@ProfessorShine @Zonacats1 @DavidPurdum @WagerMinds no one arguing offshores move the needle much more than Nevada...why specified "city."
@BillyPolcha @BobFoltman that's my bad, indeed is a law. IMO Roger Goodell changing his stance (along with leagues) most valuable for repeal
@2ndHalfChas couldn't have said it better myself...or that it's not directly connected to these monstrous TV deals and ratings
ICYMI: Sports gambling is illegal in most states; bill keeping it that way (PAPSA) is our generation's prohibition 
@jorcubsdan good chance 1% of your audience appreciates that historical reference ha
Total PPV Buys for #MayweatherPacquiao : Over/Under 3.15 Million (via @BovadaLV )
@Gardner_24 Caesars, MGM, Ameristar, etc have properties around the country. They'd lose peanuts in Vegas but make a lot more elsewhere
@Gardner_24 yes and no. Remember most major strip casinos have regional presences, would hurt tourism during peak sports weekends IMO
@OU_Patrick @GSwaim well I think it's different when you talk about tribal casinos compared to corporate casinos as well, apples to oranges
@bikezilla I think they'd have to hire the right people to make a competitive product because going -115 or something discourages bettors
@ajdickey @SportsInsights @IowaSkyler Allen's right, some very good free alternatives too just depends on your personal needs
@GSwaim I never want to say rich but I think every state would benefit immensely from tax revenues. There's a huge appetite for it already
@snitty910 not a ton. Used to have access to their premium product at Caesars just found injury updates weren't as quick ad other services
Suggesting legalized sports wagering is a threat to the integrity of pro sports indicates leagues just don't get it 
@IowaSkyler I use @DonBestSports and also recommend @SportsInsights . There are some cheaper options but don't see them as adding value
@fisheee111 trust me...already going through CFL offseason transactions now so it definitely doesn't fall on deaf ears. Time freaking flies
@3dollarbag I love the CFL...but it's still not the same. Now from a betting standpoint it's the hidden gem
You know it's a sad day when this is the message on your odds screen and there's no football until August. 
@ShaneKHennessy you want my honest take? Leagues hide behind "integrity of the game" but they haven't figured out how to profit from it yet
@MickeyRyan1045 ha that's well above and beyond my paygrade
@WagerMinds @DavidPurdum so covering the industry is taking shots at someone who used his book as the basis for sharing an opinion? Ok then
For the 2nd straight year Super Bowl betting handle eclipsed $100M. We're long overdue for national legalization 
@DavidPurdum  if you're trying to help advance the industry @WagerMinds , why take jabs at one of the city's leading operators?
@MickeyRyan1045 @MattieLouOKTC Mickey I'm honestly not sure what to expect, Mattie won't tip her hand on potential suitors...flying blind.
@anitabice1 haha I won't claim to be religious but when I need divine intervention I hope it comes at critical life junctures, not football
@Maciejewskim I don't know right after the catch but after the Lynch completion at the 2 min warning Hawks were as low as +120.
@tales17 Blue...not sure of the payout on it though

Barring something out of the ordinary, the "NO" prop on Will there be overtime cashes again this year
@RyanSides hopefully I'm not the only one who prefers discussing cleavage over balls but given twitter it's very much TBD ha
Just spoke with @DaveMasonBOL , his shop will be paying both sides of the Katy Perry cleavage prop in order to avert #CleavageGate
@CSyner no thanks…GL with your wager though my friend
@bennett_tristan @fourloko nah I'd say 21 points in 2:16 when neither team had shown big play ability will indeed qualify
Anyone sitting on the 1st half U24 can join me at the bar; I'll be the one drinking @fourloko
@kkbartender I thought as soon as you brought the Fiat off the lot that was required protocol…even if properly protected
I'm amazed with all the bad penalties Seattle takes on 3rd down to prolong drives…always thought adderall kept you focused
@wiseguys103 I like the 2nd half over, think this game opens up a bit after the slow start

@andyrubin does there feel like a large scalping community out there?  Had some friends make the trek armed with cash looking to buy
@fs1otoole how come I can't bet anthem props for Oh Canada before the Grey Cup?  It feels culturally biased @JayOnrait
If demand for Super Bowl entry is really as high as prices in secondary market indicate, convinced anyone not selling their tickets is nuts
@Arlo2121 public's been pretty steady there but has def been sharp money on the Pats in the last hour after wave of Hawks earlier this am
@ESPN_Colin strong endorsement for the under...money just as green there for sure
@davejerg it won't negatively impact handle but the house would definitely prefer a decision than a push, exactly right in that statement
I know people want a sharp consensus on today's game but there isn't one; plenty of big bets coming in on both sides offshore and in Nevada
Consensus among books catering to Las Vegas locals is they'll be #Seahawks fans today unless there's a drastic shift in betting pattern.

@thatactionboss they're entertainers...speaking to media is part of the job description. I'm sure plenty of other players don't like it
@realblackmorris they're not superstars.  They're still required to be there, if no one wants to talk or interview them different story
@PSBatHL that's a view point I can agree 100% with...he can be contrite with his answers but he's only made the situation worse
@SirCharles_7 it's a shame to waste his talent but honestly he should work with a PR Agent, I'm not saying it's easy but its correctable
@gamblingeisy you get paid millions to be an entertainer...its part of his job. Can he choose to avoid topics? For sure, see Belichick
@AndyGlockner then that's what he should be doing with all of this...and if the league decides to suspend him it's a consequence
Are we really still defending Marshawn Lynch not wanting to talk to the media? It's part of his job...he can always retire if it bothers him
@CashBailey1987 @PinnacleSports there's been zero drama on the men's draw lately aside from the Rafa 3rd set, pretty anti-climactic, ugh

@Boda45 @BruceNV Ravens stuff is much worse involving physical harm but the Pats have integrity? Cmon now...this isn't an isolated incident
@BruceNV exactly, no disagreement with you there
@BruceNV the NFL could have requested the tape from the cops directly. If they wanted the truth there was ZERO reason to involve the Ravens
@DieHard4BigBlue my fear here is that both Mangini and Belichick share my alma mater...I somehow feel I missed an upper level elective
@rgrscar I've never taken 11 balls to the bathroom with me...usually only 2.
@BobbyQuitter no doubt and that was my thought that all videos went through a similar "chain of command" but clearly not the case ha
Best part of this #DeflateGate will be when we find the ball boy acted alone of his own volition...that's when Oliver Stone makes a movie
@Scudtech @SportsSturm and of course he acted alone on this of his own volition
@KevinP1981 oh this is like the Kennedy deal...the shooter takes the fall but "he wasn't acting alone."
@NickMorano1 the commish's job is to protect the interests of the owners. This won't stop unless league is governed by external 3rd party
@BobbyQuitter well yes but amazing a NFL front office employee didn't "lose" this footage like they lost an external tape
@AaronNagler but the other video was sent to the league office...obviously priorities and different circumstances but ironic nonetheless.
The #NFL being able to get footage of a ball boy in a bathroom at Gillette 1000x faster than the Ray Rice tape is borderline scary.
@World_Wide_Wob  they told me I needed to use #Bachelor hashtag but I wasn't sure what that meant. Slow night over there with NBA snow PPD?

@whipnelson trust me, will be ecstatic when they complete I-11 and the whole 2 lane highway nonsense is a thing of the past
@Recc40 used to do Boston to Jersey, no argument getting into the City was a legit disaster when I had to do it
@linkcalhoun what I've been told anywhere between cities in TX is a disaster.  I like to think I've done it watching Friday Night Lights ha
@richdana44 driving anywhere out of Denver, during the winter, is a disaster would agree. Headed south/north during summer is legit
@BlatantHomerism this one was down 100% stone cold sober...it's slightly easier that way that miserably hungover (so they tell me)
I haven't done every major drive in the country but I'll nominate the ride from Vegas to Phoenix as one of the worst between major cities.

With Aldridge upgraded for the #Blazers, @LVSuperBook re-opens the game #Wizards -2.5 / 195.5.  Line reached as high as -5 previously...
@fisheee111 apparently the 2nd half angle on X after Demons rained 11 for 19 from deep was the proverbial nuts ha
@DJRJAY Yes +400 / No -500
@mezzy08 believe @5Dimes used to but here in town games are rarely booked until the NCAA tourney field is announced
@i_am_dank and I still have ISU and Illinois rated better. Need to preface all my comments, Demons live and die by the long ball for sure
@JalenFrRosemont @MatttWeber @depaulcampusrec my old man had season tickets back then. I grew up on them during Edwards/Strickland era
@sroe71 X bet from 11.5 to 14 by some of the sharpest groups. Demons power number still very low while X remains a touch inflated
@JalenFrRosemont @MatttWeber for years I'd have made them underdogs to win the HS state championship so even being in games now = success ha
@schillfactor let's not call them a NCAA tourney team but definitely the most promising season for the Demons in years...if sustained ha
@fisheee111 Xavier is the opposite...power number inflated (mine is as well) but watching them play defense is borderline laughable
@fisheee111 prime example of power numbers not catching up yet. Steam against them nightly but current form very impressive and underrated
@Crockadilly_ ouch
@tsad73 ha was the only CBB team I rooted for growing up.  I still don't believe this team is any good but good to see them at least compete
@vegasobie If I used the word "acca" here for our domestic audience the headaches answering their questions would be endless ha
Something I never thought I'd say this season: Depaul is the best college basketball team in the state of Illinois
Nice lil payday MT @BetfairExchange Chelsea 2-4 Bradford. Just under £1.8m matched on Chelsea at 1.15 or lower. Bradford backed at 460.0!
@ZeRaul @PinnacleSports ha would rather have the +588 available on Crystal Palace but definitely a dog day, great for the house
@bstatz Middlesbrough dominated this 2nd half but never did I think Bradford had the fire power to score 4 unanswered vs Chelsea
@mofo313 @PinnacleSports been trying to find the best live price available on Bradford facing a 2-0 deficit (cc: @paddypower @Ladbrokes )
A $100 pre-match parlay of #BradfordCity (+2400) &amp; #Middlesbrough (+950) at @PinnacleSports would pay a cool $26,150 if both hold on #FACup
@ToddLatta @LVSuperBook all good, my wording of the tweet probably didn't help things either
@ToddLatta @LVSuperBook huh? They're 4-1 to go undefeated...-500 to get saddled with a loss
Kentucky is +400 to finish the season undefeated at @LVSuperBook . If you think the Cats lose along the way you'll need to risk $5 to win $1
@breakingpol @BreakingNews @WashBlade hey @ClayTravisBGID , your comments when time allows
@VSIdocsports ha thx you too.  Way i see it in this business if there's a market, a line, and en edge to be found attack at all costs
@AndyGlockner I wouldn't even begin to know how you'd set an optimal roster.  Figure next step is CFL/CFB/NFL joint game in the fall ha
If you're going to bet the #RoyalRumble this weekend, read this preview from @VSIdocsports 
@davidfucillo you can potentially make the argument that the opening number was inflated (grabs coat off chair, slinks out of dive bar)
Nothing like a 9 pt move on the Pro Bowl to spark discussion.  Maybe the NFL would like to launch a point shaving investigation now #sarcasm

@Walanka your season tickets for this team should come with a blind fold, seat cushion, and team sanctioned cooler for BYOB at Allstate
@fisheee111 point taken but that example was more a byproduct of bettors and oddsmakers disagreeing on value of Rayvonte Rice IMO
@tsExtraTime thanks for inviting me on the show this evening (morning). Always enjoy sharing our sports betting limitations w/ new audiences
@bulletgodfrey and I made fun of myself for making that claim in September...to imply the CBB field this year is deep however is absurd
@fisheee111 I'm actually higher on NCSU than most so they won't quite make my list but inevitably it can offer a pt or 2 of value nightly
@dvond Whitehead's been out for nearly a month...if there aren't 23 teams currently better in the eyes of the media we're all in trouble
If Seton Hall is the 24th best team in the popularity poll this might be the worst collection of college basketball teams in recent memory
@smithers513 easy to verify, GCB publishes all the figures but noise in that is WIN comes from props, total, etc not just game ATS result
@KiD_GoVi @PinnacleSports cant speak for offshores but here in Vegas the norm is that 85% of the money bet on the game comes in final week
@KiD_GoVi @PinnacleSports that's the secret sauce. No sportsbooks are going to expose their financials. Line movement tells that story...

@BamaSportsRadio no doubt. Think this is the concrete example of what we already know mid-majors cant come close to competing with Power 5
@jkeith02 and i think thats the bigger issue in CFB now...power programs can pay coordinators more than mid majors can pay head coaches
CMU players will all be allowed to transfer now after losing their head coach? Oh wait...
@fisheee111 i think it highlights the biggest issue in CFB that an OC at a Power 5 pays better than  HC at mid major...have's vs have nots
Dan Enos and Doug Marrone must share similar career goals and agents
@ClayTravisBGID may as well not play the game if those guys got suspended.  You'd have to make Seattle over a TD fav in that scenario
Good to see @foxsportsreiter and @andyroddick wagering on @FOXSportsLive countdown show tonight. Hey @CharissaT , my work here is done
It's no surprise that daily fantasy is big business...but the year over year growth during busy season is staggering 
@ClayTravisBGID odds have been set for my list and I think there's a real value play in the mix...but yes, you're a co-favorite on this prop
@3HL1045 had I delivered that line on radio in Vegas there's a good chance I get full blown ex-communicated from the dating scene out here
@MattieLouOKTC @brentdougherty why do I somehow feel this suddenly became a topic of discussion on @3HL1045 in about an hour
@robertwsports no doubt about it. Let the money move the market for pennies on the dollar.

Will Bill Belichick be suspended for the Super Bowl for the Deflated Ball scandal? Yes +750 (15/2) / No -1500 (1/15) via @BovadaLV
@JDopeboi519 substantially lower. @FanDuel represents about 80% market share it appears from everything I've read
Will Bill Belichick be suspended for at least 1 game for the Deflated Ball scandal?  Yes +150 (3/2) / No -200 (1/2) via @BovadaLV

@PayneInsider you don't pay the man on losing leans...should have known 'Rebels' couldn't be bet on #SOTU2015 night
@dabearmc that was definitely a parlay to over crowd if I've ever seen one
@BulldogsRadio the start to a kinder, gentler twitter ha
If everyone had this many people clapping every time they told people what they wanted to hear our nation's self esteem would be outstanding
I hope it allows for bartending school too, vocational training MT @BarstoolBigCat Wait, can I still get my 2 free years of comm college?
@middysworld @adctennis throw in a free 6'er of domestic light beer and he might win regions of the country he never thought possible
@matt_neil well @andylankheit asked earlier and I never gave him a number...definitely would have undershot the market at this pace
@adctennis no disagreement but pretty sure Americans would be on board with legalized poker/wagering if it meant lower taxes
If Obama wants to win over males 18-45 for the remainder of his time in office he should tack a sports gambling topic bar on the screen too
@ClayTravisBGID can we get a H2H bragging rights competition between you and @GaryParrishCBS ? To make it fair we'll combine CBB/CFB records
@GoodmanESPN @GaryParrishCBS ha GP dodges a bullet on the NEC. Most games aren't lined aside from conf tourney or rare natl tv appearances
@Ask_The_Dean ah, all good. Just didn't want you having the wrong takeaway. Couldn't have said it better, trust the industry leaders
@Ask_The_Dean @PinnacleSports @Patriots who said Pinnacle made a mistake with the line? Think you missed the article's main point...
@GaryParrishCBS can we be expecting a column on the OVC, MAAC, &amp; BIG West as well for best bets? Low majors pay just as well as Power 5
@The_real_Clint 25-1 to win the west? Sure if you can find that price I'd say to run and grab it. Better chance than your Horns 4 BigXII ha
@ynaghibi12 was only a soft open while game was in progress and @PinnacleSports went from +2 to PK so only a move through a dead zone
@andylankheit hmm, need to think about this. We need full standing or breaks for applause?
@chris_champ @PayneInsider been a lot of fun doing it all year but have to give Payne most of the props. I'm just the PG there to assist.
@MicahRoberts7 my sources tell me that number will grow this year given the surplus of gambling money attributed to declining oil prices ha
"Las Vegas screwed up the pointspread for the Super Bowl - And it could cost millions" Let's pump the brakes, MY TAKE

@ClayTravisBGID O/U 6.3% of your followers that see value in these tweets and appreciate the reccos? (Under is juiced to -140)
Well at least we know the Jayhawks spent their Sunday watching the NFC championship given how this 2nd half has started for them.
@ReidForgrave every time I watch UNLV I miss Kruger more and more. Outstanding program builder and doing outstanding work again in Norman
@MeltzVegas I figured you had her manager on speed dial for some inside information on this one
@ReidForgrave KU starting the game 7 for 7 from beyond the arc will do that to a team. Still a hunch OU won't go away quietly tonight
Prop bets will come fast and furious this Superbowl season both offshore and here in Vegas. Here's your first wave 
@phillygodfather how does his reluctance to take the deal impact your handicapping? It's almost like his camp has picked up something...
@BEAVER15 a lot of it is based on perception of yesterday's results.  Books forced to move number off recency bias &amp; Pats dominant win
@phillygodfather if I was him I'd be more afraid of not taking the 120 million the way he'll go through money once the career ends
Consensus Superbowl line of Seattle -1/PK total of 49/49.5. Had game been played this weekend most books listed Seahawks -3 (+100) vs Pats
@PayneInsider @thespinzone I don't get that luxury...I need notes just to remember the games we're discussing and our twitter handles
@thespinzone @PayneInsider we make Payne record the pod without internet usage, helps put his memory to the ultimate sports test
@marrybacon like @billbarnwell pointed out illegal to push ball carrier forward but never seen it called
@DZederman I wonder if him and Mike Carey sit in the same pre-production meetings early in the week. Their jobs aren't easy but man o man
@winone going to make the SB interesting when Seattle leads the league in penalties and the Pats offense is clean as a whistle
Hitting Tom Brady anywhere is an automatic 15 yard penalty...Luck's expression tells it all but of course Mike Carey agreed.
@fisheee111 same for us. Power ratings always had them pegged lower because had a max QB rating. Not the case for Rodgers, Luck, etc..
@JosephSaintG @chadmillman most games in most sportsbooks absolutely not. Superbowl or conference titles if it's a side house needs possibly
@fisheee111 to say average gives them a ton of credit...I'd say bottom 5 in the league or damn close to it ha
@JennyTaft @joelklatt how much real estate did Burnett have in front of him after pick where he elected to slide down?
@DCMAAS not sure what was available at 19-7 but know 10-1 was widely available when Seattle lined up for the onside kick.
@selliott6 it was the side of the professionals...maybe I'm missing your question here?
@KyleLetItRide @groovinmahoovin @Buffalo_Forever @TBMWolverine my oversight. We had paid differently based on our house rules
Heartbreak for under bettors
@Mister_Dennis most definitely. Pack would have been short favs vs Colts before today and short dogs vs Pats
@BarstoolBigCat tweeting at yourself might be the ultimate man-law violation. Might need an official ruling from the Stoolies here
@Mister_Dennis will be interesting to see how books handle their effort today because while the D was good (Russ bad) offense was mediocre
I wonder if somewhere out there Percy Harvin is watching and laughing...only to remember he was traded to the Jets this year
@Lana rub some adderall on it and get back out there
@Buffalo_Forever @TBMWolverine should indeed be considered a special teams TD cashing that prop (assume that's why you're asking) ha

@JMatrax slight lean to under but would have preferred hook. IMO Green Bay establishes the ground game and trusts their defense
Seahawks -7 and 22.5 for the 2nd half via @PinnacleSports #SEAvsGB
@JPosnanski unfortunately shortest FG less than 26.5 yards doesn't pay double
Les Miles would have faked the FG there
@BarstoolBigCat call it a happiness hedge; root Seattle by a FG get that cash meaning your Bears allegiance not called into question.
@edsbs do we think Pete can sit still for at least an hour a day giving Phil the time he requires for yoga and meditation?
@ProfessorShine @er040976 exactly right. People see the board today and think "both favorites only need to win?" and that becomes their play
Books I spoke to rooting for 1 of the underdogs to win outright today eliminating ML parlay and teaser liability...much like last Sunday
@DBarraza9 no doubt...we all know this but apparently the league never wants to acknowledge. Just like fantasy football is all for fun...ha
I wonder what @nflcommish hates more: gambling on the NFL or gold cleats
@lasvegascris @Johnny_Detroit right off top of head GB vs Miami...game fell 3 with opener +3.5 and closed +2.5
@aaronpickard102 at 10-1 the "No" price on them to win allows you to break even but if you want to dump risk can play SEA ML w/upside
@lasvegascris @SportsInsights as a pro Cris, what's your philosophy when it comes to buying points in the NFL? Know everyone differs...
@er040976 it can create ball security issues and shorter fields no doubt, wind a bigger factor for most handicappers
Good read from @SportsInsights on key numbers and margin of victory when betting the #NFL 
@elJuandimunoz personally don't have a strong opinion on the game as it pertains to the side but would rather use SEA as a teaser leg now
@tpenick13 ha don't let it. There's a reason they play the games...if only it was that easy. GL today
PROS: Seahawks -7, under 46.5/45.5, Colts +7, under 53.5/52.5  JOES: Patriots, Patriots Over
@sickle135 generally yes but actually bet both Panthers games under this postseason
@AltemusSports no doubt about it given Patriots games propensity to go over in sloppy conditions.
@JDSHandicapping much more inclined to look towards the early game under personally but do respect money on the late game for sure
No surprise sharp money out ahead of the weather forecasts betting both NFL games under early Sunday despite public money backing both overs
@jstojkov @PalazzoVegas while it seems like a big move on the surface doesn't change the straight bettors handicap, only impacts teases

BET THE BOARD: Comprehensive analysis of #SEAvsGB &amp; #NEvsIND from @PayneInsider and myself for championship Sunday. 
@VegasDave99 the same way football teams run the ball and basketball teams milk shot clock? Losing fighter forced to throw caution to wind.
@Arlo2121  won't claim to have watched as much UFC over the years. Personally just a fan of transparency and forces a fighter to push late.
@SVallorani  believe I saw one of the fights. Did they ever give a reason why they abandoned the experiment?
Watched boxing for years...the one thing I'll never understand is why each judge's scorecard isn't made public after each round.
@ericcastile love the sport but lack of marquee superstars definitely hurts. IMO need one governing body, main thing UFC does so well.
@Landell3 would love to see boxing gain momentum and popularity again. Will always be my preferred discipline between the two.
This is what the heavyweight title fight has become...it's no wonder UFC has blown by boxing in popularity.
@S_Gauthaman so many different groups in hoops rarely a consensus during the regular season. List would be 100+ each Saturday ha

Complete betting analysis of the @premierleague schedule from @ukbettingpro 
@bstatz @MLS @lukeckeller I think the most interesting line of the piece is honestly how they see no overlap between the fan bases
@klcjoey @JeffSchultzAJC if you guys find them let me know, would be happy to book their action
Great read on how the Seahawks can attribute a lot of their current opportunities for success to city's @MLS brethren 
@TheRealMrACL @PayneInsider happy to do so and appreciate the input. Sounds cliche but sometimes the best bet isn't making 1 at all.
@gbdawkins @marctorrence unfortunately not an expert in the pugilistic arts, guys like @phillygodfather , @MMAOdds , &amp; @FightOdds can help

@MattLeinartQB @BruceFeldmanCFB just because you had to play more than 3 games at USC for this kind of attention Matt don't be jealous ha
@aimalarsalla ran out of characters ha but great point
Between the Knicks &amp; Jags getting shipped across the pond it's amazing the Brits haven't tried to declare war on the States this time around
@cpwick tweeted the big 6 earlier, available on my site. Heavy heavy chalk out there
@SamBorden there has to be a team in the Championship for the Knicks to play in the 2nd have, this isn't Premier League worthy
Knicks making a strong case for #NBA relegation

"It's not just a dream start, it's a Wet dream" - Ray Hudson #CopaDelRey
@AddictedtoDD ...and that means this game should officially become a circus
@lasvegascris great point, def agree the process more than the end product is why it's become a virtual shoe in to take home hardware
If you consider yourself a sports fan (don't have to love soccer) flip to @beINSPORTSUSA for #CopaDelRey between @realmadriden &amp; @Atleti
OSCARS ODDS: Prices for all 6 major categories via @BovadaLV ... Boyhood an overwhelming 1-14 fav for best picture

@govolx as long as he doesn't go Maurice Clarett on everyone...
@doug_keegan what kind of price would you use? Obviously someone out there has perfect information regarding his decision ha
I think at this point you have to make @CJ12_ around a -180 favorite to declare for the draft given the circumstances.
THIS WEEK IN GAMBLING: Daily fantasy, push for legalization, illegal bookmaking, &amp; #tbt article on the Computer Group 
@NeemAzim amazing that the Aztecs have done all of this in the double bonus, not a single FG since about the 10 min mark
@GWCapper they still basketball at Staples? #jokes
@casey19921 rare a team can hang on without a FG over the game's final 10 minutes...and the game goes over
Watching @mountainwest basketball nightly will age anyone prematurely.
@FauxMcCaskey with the thin air he'll get Olympic caliber distance
@WesReynolds1 well as @JFiorella points out he sure wasn't hunting for a stylist or department store on this trip that's for damn sure
I wonder if Bob Knight sees being sent to Laramie to call a game at 11PM eastern as punishment
@LetsTalkFantasy a lot of guys have learned on the job...even with a strong quantitative background some just "get it" while others don't
@LetsTalkFantasy economics...but I didn't have to use it to figure out they weren't covering tonight. Impressive right?
@brstan well @DJ_Bhola made a great point. They're just a 40-0 run away from getting inside the number
If you bet the @NevadaWolfPack tonight +10.5, you had the wrong side.
@BMoore822 @MattieLouOKTC haha it's the real way to win over a woman's heart...
@kaitlynvincie @JMorris_NP it looks like he's racing for "points" in a plate race, trying to avoid the inevitable big wreck up front ha
If you've done any of the things on this list (or all of them) you've spent too much time gambling this fall 
@I_am_DC @PayneInsider had some of best work done for the Divisional just hit a tech glitch. We'll be back this week, guns ablazin
@JMorris_NP @kaitlynvincie did Jmo refuse to drive faster than 10 MPH? I feel like he'd try and observe all principles of safe driving
So @MattieLouOKTC has decided I should become the bachelor for @theoktc . Odds this ends well: No -1500 / Yes +1000

@JimmySingh9 @LVSuperBook unfortunately can't argue with that at all. Would be biggest event here in years but still not foregone conclusion
@JoeFortenbaugh sounds perfect, I'll cash that dinner bet ha.  Honestly should be interesting to see how it's bet, Pacman HUGE fan fave
Floyd Mayweather listed as -275 favorite over Manny Pacquiao (+235) at @LVSuperBook for proposed fight in May
You've gambled too much this fall if just breaking even for a weekend would be good for your confidence... 
10 WAYS...you know you've spent too much time gambling this fall 
@ryanmgreene none of this should surprise us. Been the one constant under Rice's leadership, team's inability to build chemistry
@davecokin when you look at the team make-up this year, what you consider a successful season conference record wise?
@jorcubsdan there comes a point where you recruit players that can be coached to play a style...problem is Rice doesn't do that
@markrsports apparently optimism abounds knowing Heupel is gone. Could mean the team actually plays to their offensive strengths for once

@skywade27 well played my friend.

@jordanmarcr  absolutely incredible. Wrote the entire conference off for dead in September just glad I rode them the last 3 games...
Transitive property of college football: ULM &gt; Wake Forest &gt; Virginia Tech &gt; Ohio St

@mezzy08  awesome...have to give you props my friend. There's no Adam Banks walking through that door
I wonder if Gordon Bombay is in the #Oregon locker room helping the team switch jerseys right now. #Quack
@djslybri he is eligible, this will be the completion of his sophomore year.
@robpizzola makes me look dapper and distinguished...something I can't pull off in real life.
Cardale Jones making his push to be the first pick in the #NFL draft.

@BigDogwdae duh Big Dog, Jameis isn't playing ha
There seems to be 1 constant among Vegas sports book operators for tonight's game: no one wants an outright Buckeyes win and ML liability.
@NoeskeRobert be one hell of a story if that happened...imagine if Del Rio takes the job he'll definitely take a few compatriots with him
Never a dull moment on @3HL1045 ...Today's question via @bbishop23 : If you're setting a line on a crocodile vs a hippo where do you start?
@vegas_leslie @BUCKEYES068 I'd make Kubiak a -600 favorite given the ties to Elway and the fact Manning wanted to play for him in Houston
The #Broncos have officially become a grease fire if story about entire staff being let go is true. I'm so ready for a John Elway comeback
@KeeneGal amazing what a decent suit and a little bit of make-up can do to help cover up this ugly mug haha
@candyflippin ran out of characters to put "even on one leg" ha
What we learned about the #NFL in 48 hours: Fox was responsible for Peyton's quad, definition of a "catch" is vague, &amp; Rodgers is damn good
@YaBoyShives plays a bigger role in handicapping than it does in setting numbers. Hard to include a coach effect in a raw power number
@brettmcreynolds @ClayTravisBGID gun to head I'd go under, think Oregon's losses in the passing game make this a little lower scoring
From 50-1 before the year to the pick of the professionals tonight, #OhioState futures creating liability for 1 book 
@R_23_K  some major disagreement out there. Serious CFB bettors I respect have bet this thing both ways.
@CousinBart ha its a question now unfortunately of who has any arm strength left. Tough to see 2 greats on the downside of their careers.
@NUTS_shipit wrote up the title game today at 
RETIREMENT?! If you believe Peyton took his last #NFL snap yesterday there's a prop at @Sportsbook_com where YES pays 8-1 (NO is -1500).
NATIONAL TITLE REPORT: Bookmakers weigh in on the impact of tonight's game and my "official" pick on #OSUvsORE 
@HudakAdam you're looking at the Hawks opening -3 if it was played this weekend
@Trend_Betting Westgate will have the most extensive prop offering. As far as getting to watch at a book just make sure to get there early
@PayneInsider @PinnacleSports whatever doesn't kill us in this business makes us stronger. Should be interesting to see next weekend's moves
@larsarz333  rule of gambling I've lived by for ages...when it looks too good to be true, it usually is.
@EzzyATS  next week the Colts will be all yours my friend. Different animal at New England, expecting similar result as last year honestly
Everyone wants to talk about Manning's decline and the Broncos losing but the Colts and Andrew Luck won, nothing fluke like about the effort
@PinnacleSports @PayneInsider  be nice to Payne, he's been saving his lunch money for a while to get Dolphins season tickets.
@NashVegas69  no skin in the game...sad to see an all time great struggle like this.
Andrew Luck with the vintage Peyton Manning drive here...relying on guys like Zurlon Tipton #passthebaton
@jasonrmcintyre that might be giving them too much credit honestly.
I no longer have any understanding of the #NFL rules. If there was any doubt, today confirmed it.
@VegasMikeyMillz def valid pt, there were different groups. Some moved early, never anticipating a major mover/public driving it to 9.5.
Seahawks -7 (ev) and 47 vs the Packers next weekend via @BetTheGreek
Randall Cobb is no Julien Edelman with that toss.
BABES, BOOBS, and BETS? @hustlervegas would like to think it's happening sooner rather than later 
@forensicdoc09 first time we've shared bad info a day early. Pros ended up laying it with Denver, should be an interesting late game.
@TJD8686 correct. ML right now would be shorter than that in a 1 game setting against Duke or Virginia, absurd
@ScrappyKK ha definitely approaching that it would appear
@blackNteal @KentuckyMBB exactly, have no issues if a book wants to hold a price like that but make it a yes/no prop then see what happens
One Vegas sportsbook now has @KentuckyMBB listed at -275 to win the national championship. This would qualify as armed robbery without a gun
@ClayTravisBGID @GaryParrishCBS @CharissaT well let's be honest Clay, you're still gambling at a remedial grade level...for now #prospect
@tonyforsure haha that's the only excuse for enduring MWC basketball at its finest.
@GaryParrishCBS @CharissaT  this discussion brings a tear to my eye. Charissa graduated gambling 101 at the top of her class @claytravisbgid
@thespinzone if memory serves me correct U of A came in here...(albeit more crowded arena) and left with a L ha
Plenty of good seats available at Thomas &amp; Mack...with good reason. 
@bobrod42 pretty sure the pros will be able to recover after losing a bet but man that avatar, could haunt you for a lot longer than that
@LakerGMC very infrequently but we never had substantial enough volume. Funny part is this is 2nd straight week it's happened in CAR game
.@BetCRISIntl opens #Patriots -7 with a total of 24.5 for the 2nd half #BALvsNE
PUPPY LOVE: #Panthers getting 59% of the tickets at @PinnacleSports in the late game... 73% of the total bets coming in on under #SEAvsCAR
@GregPiecuch definitely popular narrative for recreational bettor to gravitate towards in handicapping but oddsmakers didn't shade at all
@YEPBLINDTBH yep, blowing Wilfork and Co off the ball giving Flacco the time he needs and creating lanes for Forsett in the ground game
@square2sharp you almost get the feeling John prefers it that way
Flacco deserves a ton of credit for executing on these 2 opening drives but don't discount John Harbaugh/Gary Kubiak for excellent gameplan
@FUBTrader @SportsInsights always a prop market that benefits the house. Caters more to the recreational bettor that isn't price sensitive
@WheelerTSN @robpizzola the better question GW is why that was the iPhone's first choice on recently used words under auto-correct ha
@miraclecovers never a bad question...but in this case it's very different groups on opposite sides here. I'm sure a small % tried to side
@snitty910 bulk of the groups I talk to played under at any price of 48 or better
@MJM0019 nah. Line was DD for a reason and not having Star on the DL hurts Carolina while their offense will struggle immensely vs Hawks D
Major difference of opinion between professionals on #BALvsNE with some groups grabbing +7 while others laying -6.5 at every opportunity
@TonBrunoWedRing nah, it's the right call on the off chance NDSU missed the EP. Being up 5 late does nothing for them.
We can only hope the FBS national title on Monday is half as entertaining as this FCS title has been today.
@112janman cmon now give me some credit. If I took to twitter every time I lost a bet my timeline would be filled with tear laden tirades
@UK_Houston_Matt you'll never hear me tell a kid not to go get his...I'd have left early too. Shit, I stayed 4 yr to make 38k #AdvantageWall
@TLAW420 Do you think Bobby uses texts? I'd probably make him a 3-1 underdog to use that form of technology
Kentucky currently shooting 27% against Texas A&amp;M...silver lining is it's still 24% higher than their mens basketball graduation rate
@Stuckey2 @SharpFootball and a limited Cam with limited weapons might be a half step above that. Carolina not exactly an elite level O
@rsharp239 If Roberson plays up to his potential and they stick to the run ISU should be fine full game but glad we got the early cash
Since wk 12, when opponents start drives inside their own 45, they've scored just 1 TD (in 58 drives) vs the Seattle D (via @SharpFootball )
Per @PinnacleSports BetShare reports, #Oregon receiving 64% of the bets for Monday's national championship 
@KJMediaDarling Bismarck 9.5 &lt; Vegas 5 #math
@JMatrax most of the big boys only grabbed Balt +7.5 if they could, no substantial position on the dog at +7 mainly public love
@KJMediaDarling Bismarck in April...rolled in was 70 and sunny, got buried under 18 inches of snow. Lovely place...to visit not live
@KJMediaDarling It's Frisco Texas, we're not exactly talking about a tropical paradise ha.  All those UND alums, such haters...
NFL #DivisionalWeekend PROS: Ravens U48.5/48, Seahawks -10.5/-11, Cowboys +6.5/+6, Colts +7.  JOES: Broncos &amp; Colts Over
@larsarz333 not what you want to hear but both @PayneInsider and I think 1 chalk goes down...Dallas a strong pro position
@rsharp239 like the dog. Tre has to play within himself not trying to do too much. Fear is experience for NDSU, prefer ISU 1st half over gm
@nasnen you do know by including @PayneInsider in the tweet I don't have to share his secrets, he'll offer an angle if he sees fit my friend
@OverZealousZeke all depends on the juice you're laying...definitely not a sucker bet at the right price, just another gambling tool
@BarstoolBigCat "it's colder in Wisconsin than it is on Mars." That's handicapping gold man, can't make that shit up
Again, my apologies to the loyal listeners of the Bet The Board podcast due to some technical issues there's no pod for the divisional round
@PayneInsider @LKmorg14 ...she told me that story would never be made public
Plenty of outstanding @premierleague action on tap this weekend; @ukbettingpro shares all the relevant betting intel 
@doug_keegan you'd have to ask @MattieLouOKTC , she's collecting all the resumes and screening candidates. I'm just along for the ride
@joelklatt there are plenty of bettors out there that will be said 2 see him leave given how strong the Ducks have been ATS w/him as starter
If you're looking for some fascinating stats on #OSUvsORE offensive firepower, @joelklatt timeline is filled with some serious numbers
@joelklatt ha serious question since I've struggled to quantify it: how do you replace 103 receptions &amp; 1800 yards sans 3 receiving threats?
@joelklatt I'm a numbers guy first and foremost and your timeline right now is even making my head spin, job well done Mr Klatt
@GentlemanMashr I won't claim to be a huge NBA guy so was floored to see damn near every advanced metric supports their season success
@ccestaro531 trust me buddy, killing @PayneInsider and me as well since we recorded the thing in its entirety, technology didn't comply
The #Hawks getting sold when they're finally relevant might be the most typical Atlanta professional sports move ever.
@vastone23 recorded the pod but had some difficulty tech wise. As @PayneInsider would say games we zeroed in on Cowboys and 1st Half U Caro
Those awaiting the Bet the Board podcast for the Divisional Rd...@PayneInsider and I had some technical issues, hoping to load it very soon
@TyWeech you will see some buyback on the Ducks in this game out of principle, mainly on the ML if it dips low enough
Ohio St $$$ continues to pour in from the professionals as @BetCRIS_Sports became the first major offshore to move Oregon to -5.5
@DanielleTrotta @CharissaT well CT you bailed on LIR (kinda) so I need to protect DT's interests. Wait, when does your CC NOT say that?
@DanielleTrotta @CharissaT @MarkTesterman3 ...but if it gets me out of hooking up Britney tickets for you ladies definitely have at it ha
@DanielleTrotta @MarkTesterman3 wait a sec, @CharissaT is the Let It Ride vet getting away with murder here on a 10 pt fav! Seattle...eaasy

@mbaird1984 NDSU -6.5 and 54 is the current consensus
TRENDING: No. 1 NFC seed is just 1-7 ATS past eight seasons in divisional playoff...four times, top seed lost outright. (via @OddsShark )
@joelklatt so what you're telling @ClayTravisBGID is that he should be investing $3 to make $1 on Marcus to be 1st overall pick at -300
#OSUvsORE PROPS via @WilliamHillUS : Cardale Jones O/U 2 TD passes, Ezekiel Elliot O/U 110 rush yards, &amp; Cardale Jones O/U 269.5 pass yards
@JMatrax yessir. @PayneInsider and I will be recording tomorrow and will post as son as it's completed
@CollinsDrew @Sportsbook_com worth noting that last year Johnny Manziel opened up at 4.5 in a similar prop market
@TSDock if you're consistently taking the worst of the number it's a dangerous line. Normal reaction with a desire to tail "sharp" money
DRAFT PROP: O/U on Jameis Winston's draft position is 3.5 (via @Sportsbook_com )
@TylerWyatt_WVLZ this Gators team a far cry from last year's edition, won't be favored often on conference road in current form
@HudakAdam think you'll see this game end up with 55/45 bet splits on the Ravens. Public's become a big fan of Flacco's road prowess
@HudakAdam think the number closes at 6.5 to be honest
MAPLE MESS: An #NHL handicapper weighs in on where he sees value in betting the next Toronto Maple Leafs head coach 
@tyl7r @saltedcashewz nothing bullish. His loss hurts their offense but probably helps their defense.  Not a game I'd be running to bet
@smoltzy9 @twitBet_com Pats took 5 days off as a team, lot to be said about continuity and momentum as well
@saltedcashewz you're seeing how different betting groups value the loss of Rice to the llini. Should be interesting to see how they play
@theminster5 I'm appalled and not horrified...not shocked obviously but this is ridiculous
@MarcusDiNitto I definitely think that plays a role but interesting that teams off byes winning 75% of games but covering a sub 50% scenario
@snydawg44 interesting game for sure given Baltimore's familiarity with Pats in postseason at Foxboro and on field match-ups
@Cveets @PayneInsider I think we can hit that but know Payne gets to be a stickler for touching subjects not listed in his contract
@PeterBurnsESPN Typhoid +100 / Dysentery +150 / Starvation +225 / Other -330.  I think Jameis would be an excellent buffalo hunter
BYE WEEK DISADVANTAGE: Bye weeks aren't bankroll builders like bettors are led to believe, especially in the playoffs 
Don't count your chickens just yet...but Ole Miss ML paid a cool 35-1 at @WilliamHillUS tonight
@castlefan0 I got over it as soon as I cashed my under ticket ha.  I'd just like to see PI as an infraction that can be challenged
@lindetrain let's see if I can turn it into an outright loss...I mean just for entertainment value and such
Larger margin of victory: TCU over Ole Miss' football team or Kentucky over Ole Miss' basketball team.  Should be interesting...
@michael99000 @nfl @CFL penalty worked both ways...and when you consider in the NFL it's a spot foul not 15 yards even bigger deal.
Hey @NFL, why not have competition committee propose challenges next year on pass interference? Worked well in the @CFL this season #change
@jordanmarcr no doubt about it. Just not a fan of people saying gambling would ruin the game, it's directly tied to the sports popularity.
@SlaytheBook that had nothing to do with gambling dollars...2nd half and full game total impacted but that's not why it's created buzz
@leagueheads feel free to email me specifics here 
The #NFL keeps admitting mistakes on officiating in #DETvsDAL ; maybe soon they'll admit they were wrong on gambling impacting integrity
DIfference of opinion on the FCS title game line: @5Dimes listed NDSU -7, 
@Lorioktc @MattieLouOKTC are you ladies done yet over there? I didn't want to interrupt your brunch meetings regarding format of the show
@TyWeech felt the passion from the crowd throughout the game, far cry from the corporate crowd that dominates the ACC for Leaf home games
@markkiszla might be like trying to pick the toughest smurf
@paulellis35 ha, you mean a single win in a series or actually getting a series win? Believe that 3rd in Boston still lingers for you guys
@Horseontheshore believe that's correct. Russia has our number in the states...more a jab at poor Leaf fans who have no silver lining coming
@BuschSports not much you can do just yet...if the Ravens survive this game there will be plenty of options available
@snydawg44 definitely grabbed the best of it, pros will be coming in on the Buckeyes. As you can see line already ticking towards 6
Has to be a weird feeling for folks in Toronto...a chance to see a championship won at the Air Canada Centre tonight #WJC2015 #LeafsNation
@Betfair to his credit #afcwimbledon is like a MLS side skill wise, perfect tune-up for his competition this summer
@Nick_0099 @PayneInsider can't do much with a Panthers future yet, only option would be to get staking risk back on Seahawks ML
@jonmorosi @pgammo too funny. Proud school tradition to which I'm unsure how they felt about an alum turned Vegas oddsmaker initially ha
@SamBernier3 believe only @5Dimes had it posted and they listed NDSU -7. Wil be widely available later in the week
@jonmorosi to see the best baseball guys including fellow @GrotonSchool alum @pgammo tweet Beanpot brings me back those east coast roots
@WesReynolds1 ha not sure I'd be following Crean either...imagine a lot of #iubb fans like yourself feel the same way too
The list of follows for @CoachJim4UM is awesome 
@JayEvensen question for you Jay: did you feel gambling on UNLV games while in attendance drastically changed fan experience?
Last week @JayEvensen wrote about the pitfalls regarding fan experiences if #NBA gambling was legalized...MY TAKE 
It took all season but 389 points (and counting) later to put all 5 of their bowls over the total, #MACtion finally arrived. #GoDaddyBowl
@govolx ha definitely don't hate when that happens.
@KegsnEggs  Adam please don't rile up the inmates, not this late on a Sunday night.
@BMoore822 @MattieLouOKTC  Bernie please don't give her more fuel for the fire (besides, no cell phone rule on 1st dates...)
There's more defense in flag football than this 
Wait, what? MT @MattieLouOKTC: #OKTCbachelor is back! The only thing you need to know is that our own TF is this seasons @theoktc Bachelor"
@potatosacs7 ha no doubt about it
Didn't take long after halftime for the #Lions to remember their true identity
Hey @CharissaT , time to get the gang back together in Vegas come March. Tell @ClayTravisBGID to pack pants and maybe @andyroddick comes too
@Cveets @PayneInsider Payne and I will differ here but I'd be playing the Cowboys -6.5 (+100) back to at least cover my risk...
#Cowboys -6.5 with a total of 24.5 (Over -120) for the 2nd half @BetCRISIntl . #Lions live moneyline -235
@DAlli90 @Cveets @PayneInsider glad you guys were able to snag the hook, should never have even been that close
@potjnr couldn't agree more that players get coaches jobs...it's then on the coach to get players and raise level of his talent.
@potjnr so you'd say he built an optimal gameplan today for his offense? Just didn't see an offense prepared or with an identity
@ChaseRuttig Joe Montana and Jerry Rice ain't walking through that door anytime soon...
If Hue Jackson parlays his play calling today into a head coaching job, that becomes an outstanding slight of hand trick.
@GSeaton using current market: +6 (-120), +6.5 (-130), +7 (-145), +7.5 (-160) if you assume .15 cent to buy on/off 7...so plenty of value
@GSeaton they're doing it to discourage any dog money for just that reason. Creating a one sided decision they feel they'll win
@BMoore822 @PayneInsider that's inevitable. You grow thick skin in this business sharing information or you quickly end up on the sidelines
Via @LVSuperBook : Broncos -7.5 / 53 vs Colts for next weekend's Divisional round.
@GSeaton if you like the dog here (I presume Lions) you're getting the best number in the world at +7.5 (-135). Can't complain too much...
@KyleMeagher1 a question I've asked for years but at the same time today isn't entirely on him, entire defense is dead...but ML is a mess
@TLannan504 the 2 best I can think of because they do thinks so differently are @So_Money_Sports and @NoJokeNHL
@Barnstorm1 the best guys to ask about integrating high public % with large game volume would be @SportsInsights , they'd have that intel
@Barnstorm1 You still look at every game independently. Value is value whether it's a favorite or a dog, move on a position with an edge
@Barnstorm1 huh? Pros don't blindly bet dogs or every single one of them but the majority do play a lot more dogs than favs in the NFL.
@Jco8621John what does that even mean?
Haha RT @VegasKJ Chalk is the beer goggles of sports wagering. Oh, she looks fine at the time, and then you sober up in the fourth quarter
@NegativeBob correct. Public actually came in on the Panthers under while professionals laid into the Steelers Over at 45 or less
PROS: Lions +7 , Bengals +4/+3.5, and both games under. JOES: Cowboys, Colts, and both games over (stop me if you've heard this before)
HARBAUGH ERA: @Sportsbook_com has opened the #Michigan win total for next football season at 8.5
@c726034 @PayneInsider Austin I feel bad Groovin is tormenting you, he clearly holds animosity towards Payne and I for no logical reason
If you're a UFC fan and looking for good Vegas reporters to follow, @AdamHillLVRJ and @casekeefer are your guys.
@lucasfulmer  worth it's weight in gold.
@bgb_11 Jury brought nothing...amazing to think late money pounded the dog amid rumors of Cerrone injury. Instead pure clinic
