@freddyandfrieda @KyleClark @jeremyjojola I can't the weather wall shows my feet. It was a sad day I had to stop wearing tennis shoes

@SeeSchultzRun be safe and hope you're not texting and driving...
1 am MDT yeah it's time for bed.
@HOLLAGO24 Thank you.
@NASCARNewsToday Wow not sure how to respond to that. Guess he didn't like the fact the forecast was right
Have a great night for those still awake and a great day tomorrow. Congrats @JimmieJohnson
That's great... LOL  
Happy Mother's Day to all the mom's out there &amp; especially to @mom2twinsplus1 Love you sweetie.

@FOXSports1 has the <CHEQUERED FLAG>! 
Here's your shout out...  
@iRainOnRaceDay @DaleJrBeard would get a shout out before you got one.
@mindy_zapata so sleep LOL
46 laps to go - who you got? #FearlessPredictions
shout-out to @Knighter01 of @catchfence - big supporter and has some great updates on Twitter tonight.
@IrishFireman_2 Master of Ceremonies or MC
Ahhhhh man LOL  
HUGE THANK YOU to @ RaceWeather - Great colleague and even better friend. He kept me informed and helped while I was out tonight
.@jeff_gluck thank you  - @RaceWeather did a lot of work tonight while I was at an event I was emceeing
Finally home from the event - now relaxing and watching the race #NASCAR
Ahh I'm a joke that's so sweet  
@BHinIA still going lol
Nearest rain is 158 mi away the blob of green/blue is ground clutter - just need to watch for any development 
Looks like we are going to go racing again... Better late than never via @RaceWeather @Jim_Utter @annaxcamille
@MRNradio I also did pretty well calling @RIRinsider
Love the sunset photos from @KansasSpeedway love to update my cover &amp; avatar - if you like me to use yours let me know
Wonderful  
@Sensei_Crystal @DanicaPack10 I think most of that activity will dissipate and also move more east than north
@JohnCostigan_IV @9NEWSWeather its not that crazy... Snow is still possible there in early Spring
Once the track is dry we should be good to go - only concern is an isolated storm/shower popping up 
Again my apologies for not my normal active self - commuted to emcee an auction for my sons' charter school
Maybe 5-10 more min of rain then drying. See nothing behind this band. I'm updating from the event I'm Emceeing 
@david33rcr at an event not even watching I'm the Emcee
@gerbz87 honestly only 2 races have been directly affected by rain - that's less than previous seasons
Per radar - rain will begin to increase @kansasspeedway 
@Blondenevadan I'm emceeing a gig I'm not the most reliable source tonight
Radar update @kansasspeedway - rain less than 10 mi about 40-60 min of rain - looks clear behind that 
Duty calls - time to start emceeing - if I get down time I'll update &amp; I'll stay in contact with @RaceWeather
Look at radar - storms getting closer still estimate around an hour of rain. Then drying - still think we can race 
I hate to do this but I'm Emceeing an event tonight and going there now. I'll update when I can &amp; follow colleague @RaceWeather
.@RaceWeather: LIVE on #Periscope: Watching NASCAR weather for Kansas - Up periscope! 
@Gajewski741 @kansasspeedway Think tomorrow looks worst weatherwise I still think they can get this in
Storms closing in fast
est. 60 min til arrival
60-90 min of rain
only concern behind is an iso/sct'd storm behind
remaining optimistic
@flahavin they are t'storms and could be strong. Could last 60-90 min
@AveryHage @JoeyLoganoFan22 @kansasspeedway I just tweeted it would rain about 60-90 min
Could get race started - then showers/storm arrive approx 7p CDT
Rain lasts 60-90 min | 60-90 min to dry track.... It's a tough call..
#NASCAR Radar update for @KansasSpeedway - Storms are 65 mi away est. ETA 60-90 min. 
@BEAVER15 @RaceWeather @Jlogano22 @NASCAR There is not set cut off that I am aware of.
Follow up w/ @RaceWeather tweet. Storms 70 mi away est. ETA 1.5-2hrs #NASCAR @kansasspeedway 
@brandonlatiker1 I'm at a movie theater all I have is my phone. Don't have any timing
I hope it's not my forecast  
Reminder - I'm emceeing an auction for my sons' school tonight - I'll update if/when I can - plz follow @RaceWeather
Out of the movie - this is the main concern near start of race. #NASCAR 
Storms about 50 miles SW of track moving NW - est arrival 90 min (all times in image MDT) 
@RedFalcon94 wasn't impressed with 3D the first time we are watching in 2D this time
Ok going radio silent - taking my youngest to see Avengers for a second time
@Kalani938 that was never my forecast nor did I ever say that
@Kalani938 I never heard that anywhere
@davidgheller I am cautiously optimistic. It's not a slam dunk. I'd be happy with halfway
@davidgheller all the info you are looking for is in that forecast I sent you or on my timeline 
@davidgheller Here's my forecast this hasn't changed much 
Cautiously optimistic. Should start on time tonight but expect storms to move in between 7-9pm Detailed forecast  
@davidgheller who told you that?
@fordracing21 welcome @Sbnation is the only place that pays me for the work I do so clicks to my work helps lol
@FordRacing21 its in the link I just posted
Have a commitment tonight - Emceeing sons' school auction tonight - may not be able to update but will try. Plz follow @RaceWeather
@blcorson8588 it hasn't changed - I holding on to that 50-60% chc.
I'm cautiously optimistic for tonight - comes down to timing - when storms form &amp; where they are when race starts 
NASCAR at Kansas Speedway 2015 race day weather: Threat of afternoon evening storms 
@ajbroadh2o_24 I do t do percent chance of rain here's why 
@spalmer88 just finished my forecast for SBNation. Keep in mind I'm 2 hrs behind eastern. Now going to bed it's 1:40a for me
Odd of racing still 50-60% w/ chc. of weather delays - Will have an update by morning. 
@briarstarr1 I  think our message has been pretty concise all week.
@briarstarr1 Showers and storms are going to form mostly WSE of track but move towards it later in the day evening.
@MarkRoess I said I think we can race. I'm still focused on Saturday.
Showers/Storms will be around SAT Afternoon  - I think we can race but I expect delays. Also storms could be strong to severe
@4stickers I don't think we had to worry about that rain LOL
Weather for @kansasspeedway tomorrow remains unchanged racing odds 50-60% concerned of iso./sct'd storms some could be severe
@4stickers it makes for good TV a tweets to play up the rain
Most of the rain on radar is moving more east than north. It's still quite a distance away #NASCAR 
Radar looks good around @KansasSpeedway should have no problems tonight for @NASCAR_Trucks
@JuddeySmooth_48 When dealing with iso/sct'd storms you really don't know anything until they form...
#NASCAR weather@kansasspeedway - We race @NASCAR_Trucks tonight
Sticking with my forecast for SAT - 
@_DaleJrBeard_ Growing more and more tempting... 
@_DaleJrBeard_ yes...
@_DaleJrBeard_ Well then I'm good enough for @DaleJr just not his beard... I see how it is... NO FORECASTS FOR YOU!
@_DaleJrBeard_ Oh now I am as smart as @Indycar_Wxman - before I wasn't even allowed on the field
@EricLPauly I really won't know until they form Saturday afternoon to the west
@flahavin @RaceWeather for me trying to get ready for work and get things done
@bobpockrass @HaroldandRenee it all comes down to timing of Sat Night storms
#NASCAR @KansasSpeedway weather forecast - We could race but storms remain a concern 
@Kenny_Wallace congrats sir
Been talking about socks, ties and cuff links tonight - here are the cuff links I'm wearing tonight 
@LSHenshaw @ineedclarity14 @annoyingracefan I even have #NASCAR cuff links
@LSHenshaw @ineedclarity14 @annoyingracefan I bet they are... The only letters I have are B &amp; N...
@ineedclarity14 @LSHenshaw @annoyingracefan I don't watch house of cards (Had to look it up)
@cpasquarella I am a fan but I don't have a specific driver. I have learned to root for good stories. Good finishes and seeing fans happy
@annoyingracefan @sclindon I wear Garcia Ties.
@cpasquarella i am not a specific fan of any driver but I do want to see @JeffGordonWeb go out on a great season
@CastleberryGina @annoyingracefan 
@CastleberryGina @annoyingracefan bow ties are cool but not for me
@annoyingracefan I do wear fun cuff links with my shirts. Tonight they are one of my many #Lego Ones.
@annoyingracefan I wear mostly black dress socks since I am always in a suit.
@annoyingracefan white...
@brandonlatiker1 I try to - very few do I miss.
Favorite all time driver is Rick Mears. First #NASCAR driver was @JeffGordonWeb - Today don't have a favorite  
Think we can race both FRI &amp; SAT - most nervous about SAT. Timing of any storms/rain is in question&amp; also the severity is a concern.
Good to know... I will try to do one tomorrow with one of my updates... Thanks @jeff_gluck  
@jeff_gluck It was my very first one... I could do a second one. Real quick
@JamesAGentry right now the best dynamics are to the west... That's good news. I don't know the "TOR-CON" that's a Weather Channel Thing
So I just did my first Periscope broadcast and talked about our chances to race and my thoughts on the forecast.
@firemedic_tj never said we weren't going to race.
@DAKOTAHAM53 @kansasspeedway I gave @BMSUpdates a 40% chance of racing.
@kngsport actually all three sons' school
I have a speaking engagement SAT Night - I'm MCing an auction for my son's school from 6-9pm CDT. I'll try to update when I can
@briarstarr1 That's higher than I gave @BMSupdates
The threat for severe storms remains for late SAT night. Timing continues to be the biggest challenge. 
New data is coming in sticking w/ original though. 50-60% we race SAT night. But storms/delays are poss. @kansasspeedway
@Dipschtick2 No you're fine. No worries I bring this on myself. My tweet WAS NOT meant for anyone. I just want to do the best 100%
@dylan27w the upside right now @RaceWeather and I are not thinking washout. This is more like @BMSupdates than @RIRinsider.
Will have this in my update later tonight.... @RaceWeather &amp; I are concerned about the threat of Severe Weather SAT night @KansasSpeedway
I apologize not as a response to any of you but because in my heart I feel like I am letting people down. This is a labor of love.
Been working w/ @RaceWeather on forecast - Odds we race 50-60% Concern is timing. We expect poss. rain delays &amp; even stoppage FRI &amp; SAT
I'm sorry I'm not updating as many of you expect &amp; demand. Swamped at work &amp; haven't had the time I like to update. I'm truly sorry.
@briarstarr1 I've been posting on Twitter. There are some thoughts forecast in my stream.
@_DaleJrBeard_ I wish someone would just shave you LOL...
@FordRacing21 they're moving just slowly.. it's just how the flow is going right now...
always a critic...  
#NASCAR weather for @KansasSpeedway Still have a chc. of showers/storms both FRI &amp; SAT but odds of racing 50-60%
.@RaceWeather: Short-term, rain is falling @KansasSpeedway - could delay 2 PM CT start of Truck Series practice 
Talking with @RaceWeather &amp; we agree odds of racing 55-60% both FRI/SAT but with poss. delays due to rain/storms
Was out at my local #NASCAR home track Magic Valley Speedway working on a story next week 
@GpsWfo @Mr_NASCARfan20 @kansasspeedway it did for three straight weeks not a single chance of rain...
Looking at just SAT - My odds of racing SAT night is 45-55% @kansasspeedway Severe storms fire West move East during the evening.
@DAKOTAHAM53 Not yet - I'm at work and on a strict deadline. Updating what I can.
Need to clarify - @kansasspeedway 
- Chc of storms/showers FRI &amp; SAT 
- Like @BMSupdates poss. breaks
- Could be long enough for racing
@briarstarr1 Saturday night into Sun
@briarstarr1 did you see this tweet? 
Like @RIRInsider I have a work related engagement SAT night - Working w/ @RaceWeather on the forecast - he will update SAT Night.
@briarstarr1 which system?
#NASCAR Concerned about the potential for severe storms Saturday into Sunday (Sat Overnight) @kansasspeedway 
Looking at more data for @KansasSpeedway for FRI/SAT waves of showers/storms but also breaks. Think we see openings for racing #NASCAR
@CBWFAN I will do the #Indy500 and qualifying but right now looking at just this weekend #NASCAR @RaceWeather
@WickedJ8 it's ok sometimes it's when you catch me. I was in serious mode as I am on TV right now. My apologize too.
@WickedJ8 i was returning it but that joke is getting REALLY tired...
@WickedJ8 you can but I don't make it rain so it's a wasted blame.
@cstiles24 really Atlanta was the first test and we were ok. It wasn't until Bristol we had bad weather. This is a quiet season
@MontysAmendment i haven't looked @IMS forecast.
.@JuddeySmooth_48 I don't have an "official" forecast yet. Only just started to look at data. Giving my first impressions.
@cstiles24 it didn't help California
@JuddeySmooth_48 I don't do percent chances but rain is still possible FRI as it is SAT - They won't move a race backwards
For the record - I think it comes down to timing of storms/rain. Not ready to call washout. Could have possible windows.
SpongeBob DOES live under the sea &amp; this weekend's race is named for him so maybe rain is appropriate #NASCAR
Looking at data for @KansasSpeedway - it doesn't look good &amp; concerned about the threat of severe storms too. #NASCAR
@RaceWeather surprised to see you tweeting thought you MIA today?
@RaceWeather @chaseelliott @TheMikeBagley I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet...
I haven't had time to look at any @kansasspeedway weather data - main job has had 110% of my attention. Will start around 9pm EDT
@tn8titans ok done
Congrats @DaleJr and the @Nationwide team in their @TalladegaSuperS win. #NASCAR
@RaceWeather @TalladegaSuperS you're mean...
Stunning weather and day @TalladegaSuperS - if your there use sunscreen - if you don't you'll be sorry - 
@_DaleJrBeard_ @Indycar_Wxman yeah I was playing along too
@_DaleJrBeard_ @Indycar_Wxman it's true - I'm no good
Weather doesn't get much better than this for #NASCAR @TalladegaSuperS - 
@RaceWeather I was watching #AgeOfUltron I'm guessing better fighting
#NASCAR weather for @TalladegaSuperS on Sunday = A-W-E-S-O-M-E || sunshine and low 80s
#Avengers Assemble taking the family to see #AgeOfUltron #Legos #Excited 
@jhildebrand44 The one that protects the most.
#NASCAR @TalladegaSuperS - much improved weather this weekend 
@Jordan_Bianchi shut your mouth LOL
I think the weather forecast image for @TalladegaSuperS speaks for itself #NASCAR 
@Rojodi it's the 6 day work week...
All afternoon I thought today was Friday #WishfulThinking
#NASCAR weather for @TalladegaSuperS remains unchanged - looks great this weekend Sunny FR-SUN 70 FRI warming to 80 Sunday
Danica Patrick losing GoDaddy #NASCAR sponsorship 
@BHinIA @annoyingracefan I didn't actually get to keep the plaque
@annoyingracefan Yeah I am not needed this week (tear)
@annoyingracefan you were gone LOL
@JuddeySmooth_48 One week one race at a time... Accuracy this far out is not very good for 10 day forecasts
@Riceman61 just DM me when a good time is for you...
Sunny skies from FRI-SUN for @TalladegaSuperS weekend starts near 70 and hits 80 by Sunday... Nice change from the rain #NASCAR
@Riceman61 you free anytime this week for a phone call?
@RyanLMcCollough welcome
@dtomlinson1990 I take it one race weekend at a time that's the only race that matters each week.
@dtomlinson1990 keep in mind SUN/MON before @RIRInsider it said it would be dry and nice.
@dtomlinson1990 i'd bet $5 it won't remain the same over the next 10 days. accuracy this far out is 10-20% at best
Weather forecast for @TalladegaSuperS continues to look great - FRI sunny 72 | SAT sunny 76 | SUN sunny 81 #NASCAR
Looks like @RaceWeather &amp; I are on the same page this weekend for @TalladegaSuperS - High confidence on a nice weekend for #NASCAR racing
Confidence remains high for nice weather this weekend @TalladegaSuperS - Weather remains nice for tire testing @IMS #NASCAR
@CaptComeback sent you a DM...
@jim_utter thank you sir... It was a good night... I dethroned a guy who had won at least 5 straight times
@bamagreer @spann I was watching him online 4 years ago during the outbreak. Also been on @weatherbrains a couple times.
@bamagreer I admire @spann as a colleague and a person.
Decided to look @TalladegaSuperS weather this weekend &amp; agree w/ @spann high confidence for nice weather this weekend #NASCAR
@darkwingj just tweeted the forecast as you tweeted me
Weather forecast for @IMS tire test MON/TUE is dry - temperatures near 60 degree... Mix of clouds and sunshine #NASCAR
There's a 100% chance of tire testing @IMS tomorrow &amp; Tue. Not sure how that plays into your forecast 
@spann coming from Mr Alabama Wx how can I argue that endorsement lol thanks James @leeharrisauburn
@leeharrisauburn @spann I haven't looked yet but Sunday and Monday of last week for @RIRinsider looked great too for SAT night
@jim_utter as always thanks for all your support.
What a weekend... Thanks for all the congratulations - it was a good weekend - glad we were able to race this afternoon. #NASCAR
Looks good and thanks @RaceWeather for all your help this weekend  
I’m still out of town - weather looks cool &amp; a bit cloudy but DRY if anything changes follow colleague @RaceWeather
@kp425 happy belated Birthday hope it was awesome
I'd say the chc. of rain midday is no more - track is drying - let's do this - 
#NASCAR @RIRinsider race day weather (take 2) we will race but do we start on time? 
@annoyingracefan thanks for your support - here's the hardware 
@mirandarinehart are you in Idaho? He's won the last 5 years that I know of...
Looks like it will be on FOX at 1 pm EDT 
It's time to celebrate with @mom2twinsplus1 here in Boise. Very low key... @Cheesecake
@JasonAnderson55 I did 
#NASCAR SUNDAY race day weather @RIRInsider - any rain should clear out near &amp; after noon we should be good folks.
That was a big win - the guy who came in second had won this category for many years straight.
The results are in for Best Weathercast in Idaho and... 
Appreciate the positive vibes from the #NASCAR family - Dinner is starting &amp; I'm up for best Weathercaster #idahopressclub #IdahoNerdProm
@Speedway_Steve dinner is just starting - it's 7:15 MT
@TheOrangeCone @TheMikeBagley I agree too - smart decision to wait until Sunday @NASCAR
@tsmithmangum @RaceWeather good call by @NASCAR in my opinion - rain will reform &amp; most &amp; drizzle would be an issue (hard to see on radar)
I really have to thank colleague, friend &amp; very good meteorologist @RaceWeather for his assistance today - true team effort
SUNDAY looks better - rain diminishes towards afternoon see no reason why we don't race tomorrow #NASCAR
It's always a gamble to use words like "washout" in a forecast but I felt confident in what I saw to say that tonight
Personally I'm glad they postponed it - now I can enjoy awards dinner - see you all tomorrow
This is the main concern when the main rain diminishes around 8-9pm - With high humidity &amp; cool temps drizzle &amp; mist 
@Just_AP I think we will see more of this moisture feed in &amp; see some of this move a little south. Very tough call. Not ideal
Small window starts to open 8-9p - issue will be drying (hi humidity, cool temps (40s), lgt winds) &amp; decision by #NASCAR - Racing odds 20%
Reminder - Traveling (updating while making a pit stop) have an awards dinner tonight - won't be updating per usual plz follow @RaceWeather
@neal_toth @RaceWeather Atlanta wasn't much of one then Bristol and now Richmond so I'd say 3 or 2.5 lol
@JuddeySmooth_48 @ian_hays @RaceWeather and high humidity moisture is still high
@TonyBarrios no changes while there may be diminished/ breaks in rain starting 8:30-9p not sure it stops long enough to dry &amp; race
Talked w/ @RaceWeather we agree rain breaks some between 8:30-11p but NOT optimistic it's enough to dry/race odds of racing 10-20% #NASCAR
Hitting the road - won't be tweeting - follow @RaceWeather - will update again in a couple of hours
@KClausWBOY not looking good in my opinion 
Headed out today for an awards dinner tonight (up for best Weathercaster) Update when I can but follow colleague @RaceWeather for updates
@TysonLaut23 I have my forecast for tonight and tomorrow here -
@sandra_sizemore @RIRInsider I still think washout too.Just don't think it's enough
The tiniest sliver of hope tonight starts about 9 p.m. Hi Res models show rain diminishing/breaking 9 into midnight.
@bshell00 moisture over running colder air along with stalled boundaries around VA. It just keeps feeding itself. Expect rain not storms
Rain did arrived early but I'm sticking with my forecast. Rain breaks up 9-11pm just not sure it's enough 
#NASCAR @RIRInsider - weather forecast for tonight's race is looking "doubtful" 
@48_Fan_LA how are you doing?
Rain ends mid to late afternoon on Sunday...  
@mdvtfan @RIRInsider The fan in me wants that but the meteorologist still gives odds of racing tomorrow maybe 20-30% &amp; not optimistic
@mdvtfan @RIRInsider The only thing fans should hope for is earlier arrival not later.
@ajbroadh2o_24 I honestly don't know but I hear about it every time we go to @RIRInsider
@armond_ealey @RIRInsider I seriously doubt it. I'd take that bet that rain hits the track tomorrow.
#NASCAR Weather for @RIRInsider rain from 2p-8p breaking up from 9p to 11p but not sure it's long enough to race... 
@M_Magnus28 no severe too cool
@sandra_sizemore will do thanks
FYI if you own a business and want to appeal to a large #NASCAR audience. I'm looking for sponsor. #shamelessplug
@_JonWood @reddog94 Fully endorse @radarscope - I think its time I make a Weather App.
@Dipschtick2 @amafera no one has done it (yet) I like to stay out ahead before I get them LOL
#NASCAR weather @RIRinsider SAT night rain likely - odds of racing 20-30% starts to break some 9-11p not sure enough. Dries out SUN PM
@CaptThunder @LittleThunder3 Sorry I didn't see this until now. Off hand I don't know. I haven't looked.
@_JonWood it was in my SBNation forecast. I try to push that since they're the only ones who pay me for this
Keep in mind I do these weekly #NASCAR weather forecast cause, like you, I'm a fan... I hate giving forecast like these - I really do.
@_JonWood I was working on it between tweets LOL no big deal. I have odds 20-30%
@_JonWood just tweeted it...
While not optimistic about SAT night - odds of racing are 20-30% Rain breaks up some between 9-11pm tomorrow (not sure it's enough though)
@_JonWood I haven't talked to @wxbrad - Based on what I saw - it's still pretty wet. Could see rain break up by 9-11pm (how much not sure)
FYI for tomorrow - Won't be available like I was last weekend. At an awards dinner SAT night. Will tweet some but also work w/ @RaceWeather
@AZHARVICKFN @mwh72f4 so far - I haven't had any rude messages. I take them in stride and as a #NASCAR fan I do understand the frustration
@AZHARVICKFN @DeLanaHarvick @RodneyChilders4 @KevinHarvick definitely not as confident as last week. Looks a lot wetter.
@DennisUltima @tpierc07 I am thinking MORE Sunday afternoon than night
@joffutt1 That Sunday tweet was a followup to this tweet 
@cyntod I don't think we are looking at severe weather but we will have rain through the evening night
Sunday has rain through midday but ending/drying out Sunday afternoon/evening. #NASCAR
@Dipschtick2 chance of rain through midday drying out in the afternoon/evening.
Rrain arrives between noon-3pm SAT and stays through the evening &amp; night... I don't see a realistic window tomorrow night #NASCAR
@MikeSan45071789 Well to be honest that 40% last week was more like 60% - I just didn't want to jinx it LOL
Will be looking at more data this afternoon here's my forecast from this AM 
SPSAKQ from 4/24/2015 9:20 AM to 11:30 AM EDT for @RIRInsider: INCREASED FIRE DANGER THIS AFTERNOON.… Read more at 
Rain is likely SAT Night @RIRinsider - will they race or be forced to Sunday? 
@annoyingracefan right back at ya...
@Leslie88_48 Nope less windows of opportunities. @BMSupdates there was distinct breaks this will be wide spread showers.
@ajbroadh2o_24 waiting on the 00z weather data to come in to get a better/accurate feel.
Coordinating with @RaceWeather for Saturday night - Up for best weathercast @idahopress Club awards. Will update but via phone.
@RyanLMcCollough @RIRInsider Trust me I know.. Not trying to but I keep it real. That's why I am one race one week at a time
@RyanLMcCollough early forecast for @RIRInsider also looked "great" long range forecast are very unreliable
Trust me I don't like giving these forecast let alone 2 weeks in a row... Also I have an awards dinner Sat Night so I will be MIA
@brandonlatiker1 @RIRInsider during the west coast swing there were 0% chance of rain.
@brandonlatiker1 @RIRInsider Actually we've been very dry with the exception of ATL and Bristol...
FRI @RIRInsider looks great but SAT night = wet. Less windows than @BMSupdates - SUN chc. of showers but more opportunities #NASCAR
@AllHorsepower I'm at work so I have to do mor work before I put it out
@AllHorsepower wasn't my forecast
@AllHorsepower that's why forecasts out several days are very inaccurate - areas of rain likely Sat Night
Hate to say this but it looks like #NASCAR will have to endure showers SAT Night @RIRInsider - Arrive late afternoon/evening &amp; stick around
I'm sorry for my tardiness on the @RIRinsider forecast been a rough week. I will get something as soon as I get to work
SPSMRX from 4/23/2015 10:42 AM to 6:00 PM EDT for @BMSUpdates: INCREASED FIRE DANGER THIS AFTERNOON.… Read more at 
SPSMRX from 4/23/2015 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM EDT for @BMSUpdates: PATCHY FROST POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHWEST… Read more at 
It’s funny how you can listen to something that has nothing to do with you - yet has a message embedded that has everything to do with you
@kjflye If I travel &amp; don't have time to forecast I'll look at either NWS or Local TV Media forecast. @RaceWeather
@WSKYWGN @BeastLightRtrt well there is a chance of a shower we will no more the next 24-48 hrs
@caseystevenson4 @lbstewart @RIRInsider IMO &amp; talked w/ @RaceWeather it's going to come down to timing &amp; this far out it's unreliable
@lbstewart I don't comment on other people's forecast - I'll only comment on mine. Expect lots to change as we get closer...
Chc. of showers have crept into the @RIRInsider forecast - I'm not terribly worried at this point but will continue to monitor #NASCAR
Love what you do in life. Be dedicated &amp; work hard. But also LOVE &amp; PLAY Hard. Your life touches so many around you. #LessonFromByrnes
Watching @FOXSports1 tribute to @SteveByrnes12
What I love about #NASCAR is We Are All Family - We lost a family member today RIP @SteveByrnes12 #ByrnesStrong 
@JimLaPlante glad you got to see a race and it was exciting and hopefully not too wet
Been coordinating with @RaceWeather - will get another @RIRInsider update later today when I look at new data
@annoyingracefan @NASCARBTW Thanks but let's not jinx the @RIRInsider forecast. Idaho Press Club awards are SAT Night need it to be nice
#ByrnesStrong
@NASCARBTW @annoyingracefan If I don't lobby for myself no one else will.
@annoyingracefan Someone has to keep you honest.
@annoyingracefan what?!  my forecasting skills this weekend didn't make THE TOP FIVE LOL
@NotLandonCassil It's not my forecast - I expect a lot to change between now and then.
@freelancer1731 I'm not worried. Not yet.
Forecast data has changed, now showing an incr. chc. of poss. rain for @RIRInsider SAT but CAUTION lots can/will change next few days.
@nealmasri @RIRInsider depends on what forecast you look at, there's a lot of "IF's" right now... Lots can &amp; will change they always do
@Riceman61 @BMSupdates @PRNlive great broadcast got to hear part of the end of the race while I was at work. Have a great week
@Noble_Jim Sorry I missed your birthday - thanks man for always supporting me even if I am a TV Meteorologist...
@turnpiketurk thank you for all the reports.
Right now the weather forecast for @RIRInsider looks good and MUCH better than this past weekend. #NASCAR

@CornyDaOutlaw @jeff_gluck @BMSupdates Yes I know but I figure it never hurts to tell people...

I have a show to prepare for but I will be watching the radar &amp; looking out for #NASCAR fans @BMSupdates as dangerous storms approach
#NASCAR Radar update - Severe T'storm Warning just west of @BMSupdates Less than an hour till it hits 
@WillyAlan529 that's up to the Air Titans and NASCAR
They have about 40-50 minutes until the strong to severe storms reach @BMSupdates #NASCAR 
I am serious @turnpiketurk has been wonderful for @RaceWeather and I today with his reports from the track THANK YOU
thank you our at the track reporter RT @turnpiketurk: Very light sprinkle falling @BMSupdates @NASCAR_WXMAN
Radar view under caution - light sprinkle maybe a shower 5-7 miles out from @BMSupdates #NASCAR 
@sortega2279 I am in Twin... I am the Chief Meteorologist for @KMVTNews
@BHinIA got it last week.
I am in Mountain Time. I converted wrong in a hurry as I also prepare for TV in Idaho. Sorry all times should be 9:30 pm...
@SpringWolf sorry bad time conversion on my part... From MT to Eastern Time
#NASCAR 8:30 p.m. EDT radar for @BMSupdates - Info on the images. 
Looks like those showers south of @BMSupdates will mostly pass by to the east - small chc. It clips 
#NASCAR fans driving home or camping be weather aware of those storms to the west-southwest strong to severe est. 90 min away
@bellnathan14 I have no idea, what you meant in that tweet. I am sorry.
@bellnathan14 Good luck in achieving your goals...
@bellnathan14 I work in the intermountain west. I know &lt;wink&gt;
@bellnathan14 they are riding the ridge and I notice they weaken as they try to go north.
Est. the storms to the west about 2-3 hrs away - rain near Asheville I think will die out &amp; miss the track #NASCAR 
@turnpiketurk No the trend is those are riding the ridge to the northeast
@andyacr it's moving north-northeast.
Look at radar - very small sprinkle - western edge of precip slow to move east. Clipped the track. #NASCAR 
OK so I was a few laps shy when I said "Official Race" but we all know it's my job to predict the future. LOL #NASCAR #NoMondayRace
Well we can officially say we will not be racing on Monday #NASCAR @BMSupdates
@turnpiketurk cant see how fast but right now the next rain/storms are several hours away
@UTF1127 good thing for me this is my career. I'm the Chief Meteorologist @KMVTNews
@DLMMFan I have to work tonight...
If you own a business &amp; like my information &amp; want to use my reach on social media. I'm looking for sponsorship with my forecasts.
I just need to say THANK YOU to all of you. Everyone who messaged me/tweeted me was very nice - That is greatly appreciated.
I think we can go the distance... The line of storms to the west are moving slow enough we should get this in #NASCAR @BMSupdates

We're coming back on @FOXSports1 at 6:30 PM ET! 

#NASCARprimetime
@DonRohr Fox Sports 1
also @RaceWeather too RT @KalebCombs: <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏻<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏻<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏻 standing ovation to @NASCAR_WXMAN who has been spot on with his forecast all week and today
I will keep an eye on the weather and radar over @BMSupdates but I do have to work tonight and need to start on my local forecast.
If @NASCAR gets the track dried tonight - tonight's race will be on @FOXSports1
Look at 5:40 Radar over @BMSupdates - back edge over track. Let's hope drying starts soon. #NASCAR 
The issue is not how long the window will last but if a scattered shower/storm forms and moves over the track.
for those asking if I think we can race tonight see this previous Tweet - 
Rain will be ending soon over @BMSupdates 
either @NASCAR or any member of the media RT @Eddie_Here:  Who will announce it if they can race tonight on Twitter? Thanks.
Behind this main rain (diminishes 45-60 min from now) only sct'd/ iso. showers &amp; storms. #NASCAR @BMSupdates
If I had to guess or estimate I think between 7 to 8 pm could a realistic time they get back to racing #NASCAR
@ricker88Nascar that's just for radar and its RadarScope
Back edge is getting closer to @BMSupdates - behind it mostly dry chc. Sct'd storms and rain 
@DAKOTAHAM53 think a solid time...
@RaceTalkRadio thanks a lot sir a lot of effort between @raceweather and I today
@d2usher @jim_utter that's why people follow me...
Its looking like the back edge of the rain to the SW is maybe 60-90 min from diminishing... #NASCAR @BMSupdates
Here is a look at the wider radar over TN - Also my thoughts on if we can get back racing. #NASCAR 
@johnjquinn3 sorry about that...
3:40 PM radar update @BMSupdates still moving about 45 mph to the NE #NASACAR 
@jamiemcmurray @maddawg077 I don't make it rain - it doesn't depend on me I have no decision making with NASCAR
Forecast has been playing out almost as scripted... Here are my thoughts on tonight &amp; if we can race 
It's raining you don't need me to tell you that. I will update if I see anything change. but still think the forecast is on schedule
@HerdRecruits @wxbrad I see a possibility of them getting back later. Behind this rain it does dry out. It's possible they race again
Rain is moving about 45-50 mph about 100 miles to the back edge so yeah 2 maybe 3 hour delay. #NASCAR @BMSupdates 
This delay could last 2 to 3 hours - maybe longer - trying to time it out right now. #NASCAR @BMSupdates
knew it was a matter of time RT @turnpiketurk: @NASCAR_WXMAN @RaceWeather raining hard again @BMSupdates
#NASCAR 2:22 pm EDT radar doubt they get far 
Report from the track RT @turnpiketurk: @RaceWeather @BMSupdates @NASCAR_WXMAN rain beginning again
Rain closing in around @BMSupdates (2:00 pm EDT Update) #NASCAR 
#NASCAR @BMSupdate afternoon weather update. Can we, will we race later today/tonight? 
1:45 PM EDT Radar - Current break in the rain is too short to start the race IMO. Better chance is behind next batch 
@hookemrusgus @jayski @BMSupdates and no cautions?
A lot of you asking questions I've already answered in my forecast this morning. 
@w3dn3sday99 That's consistent with what I've been saying the main issue is if more rain/storms FORM behind that.
- IF - #NASCAR moves the race to Monday - the forecast while showers are in it - they're more scattered than today. #HopingForSunday
Thank you sir. I hate it too. RT @TheOrangeCone: Hate today's weather but love the work that @NASCAR_WXMAN does for race fans.
.@joeylogano nailed it - I say this a lot - it's not the rain you see on radar but the rain you don't you have to worry about.
Yes still sticking with my forecast RT @LovettMatthew: so what's the chances up to now or your sticking to 40%
If we get one it STARTS between 6-9 pm RT @mattkamper1994: When do you think that there will be an opening to get the race in today?
#NASCAR radar update - yes there's a window but I think it's only about 90 min (it's shrinking some) @BMSupdates 
Not giving up on today just yet. Bristol has lights RT @kcr45: @jayski tomorrow race you think

Proud of the #NASCAR fans who are braving the rain! You guys rock! 
@wxbrad I see that break SW but not sure it will be long enough for anything substantial agree with window opening between 5-9p @RaceWeather
For additional weather updates to mine follow colleagues @wxbrad and @RaceWeather
Absolutely agree. here's to long enough windows. RT @armond_ealey:  it will be a challenge to get the race in today
Yes possible in that batch in GA RT @druspics:  any lightning coming in that second batch?
@turnpiketurk I just tweeted this 
#NASCAR Noon radar update. Poss. extended break in 45-90 min but may only last 2hrs. @BMSupdates 
@turnpiketurk @weatherchannel Their app uses on forecast data set. I think I know which model they are using.
WILL WE RACE TODAY? Odds of racing 40%
EST. START TIME? No - too many variables
Staying with my forecast - 
@drogenius I don't have a time... Too many factors have to come together.
@SkylerCFox but the rain isn't moving west to east but SW to NE... Thanks for the photo and staying positive.
@SpeedwayThunder The truth is I don't know the odds of racing today are still less than 50%
When I say window "STARTING 5-9p" That's not the length of the window that's time frame on when it might open... #NASCAR
When we get a break long enough to dry track &amp; race. RT @SpeedwayThunder: @BMSupdates Expected race/start time?
#NASCAR radar - rain cont. off/on into afternoon - poss. window starting 5-9p @BMSupdates 
I answer many of the questions I get on rainy race days and let you know my thoughts on today's #NASCAR race 
#NASCAR race day weather for @BMSupdates - what does the day look like? Answers here 
It's almost 4am MT haven't been to bed yet going to try and get maybe 5 hrs of sleep. When I get up ill have an update
#NASCAR @BMSUpdates race day weather. Before you ask, read my detailed weather forecast. 
@randomnascar I feel like we have a good shot at racing. I've been pretty optimisticc
@allenbwdgood I won't know until rain forms moves through and we have the window cause there could still be sct'd showers around
@DaleJr Think it rains in the morning into the early afternoon. But could see breaks/window opening up between 4p-8p
@GOPfollowernate same as what I saw yesterday and similar to what I posted this morning .
Think a window could open up SUN as early as 4pm or as late as 8pm. Once it opens we could get the race in.. #NASCAR
In case you missed it here's my weather forecast for Sunday - 
@confirmed104 one is day one is night
Update to my #NASCAR weather forecast for @BMSupdates - some improvement in the odds

@PRNlive @Riceman61 do you need my weather forecast services for your coverage @BMSupdates? Any response is welcomed thank you
@RhinoLeGrand @wxbrad @RaceWeather From all I've witness doing this. They'd rather get the race in on the day it's scheduled when they can
@wxbrad @RhinoLeGrand @RaceWeather Like I said we might start to see a window open up between 4pm to 8pm as Brad said.
@nascarcasm you work for @NASCAR you can afford to hire a neighbor kid @racepix
Latest data is coming in. Rain likely SUN AM into SUN afternoon - Poss/ window late day/evening (4pm to 8pm) for racing @bmsupdates #NASCAR
@therealbdiddy @BMSupdates Why do you think I say we could race later that evening. It's not the same but similar.
@darkwingj Right now the odds of a Tuesday race are too low to even think about forecasting
@radioguy1222 @BMSupdates I guess that's not entirely true... I do work for a FOX affiliate in Twin Falls ID @NASCARONFOX
@radioguy1222 @BMSupdates I just forecast the weather... I have no connection with @NASCAR or @NASCARonFOX
@radioguy1222 @BMSupdates they waited out 5 hour delay last year.
@JuddeySmooth_48 @BMSupdates obviously.
@ashburn_adam @NASCAR @RodneyChilders4 They never have because of the original date and TV contracts and agreements with Tickets/ and tracks
Updated weather forecast for @BMSupdates - wet SUN but I think we get a break SUN night. Odds of racing now 40% 
@RaceWeather have a nice night...
@AdamB_11 @RaceWeather right now I was thinking more like 8 pm when we could poss. get a window.
@TravisEHaston While I think they can start the race that's still a concern of mine if they can get racing Sunday.
.@2Spotter @BMSupdates been saying that all week... But yes a chance #NASCAR found away last year I think they can again this year.
What struck me about this year's weather forecast, we were saying the same thing as last year &amp; #NASCAR found a way to race. #optimism
#NASCAR @BMSupdates If I had tickets to SUN race, I'd go. Seeing a scenario where we could race SUN Night poss. after 8 pm
@amarquis32 please read my forecast - 
@2Spotter @allnascarallday while the likelihood of racing Sunday is very low last year was similar - just need one good window.
My #NASCAR weather forecast for @bmsupdates this weekend. Rain gear is a must 
#NASCAR weather forecast @BMSupdates find out what I think will happen this weekend 
My detailed #NASCAR forecast for @BMSupdates will be posted at 8 am - not using the words "wash out"
@HF312 you've been hacked
@GOPfollowernate I don't make the weather I'm telling you what I see.
@dalefan34ever I'm giving the odds of actual racing at or less than 25% At this point more concerned of even getting a race started
@AllenBedgood @BMSupdates timing can always change... More of the models are coming together saying the same thing.
@NASCARWWEGuy388 @BMSupdates there's always a chance but the likelihood is less than 25% in my opinion
current data shows rain arriving towards midday and ending between 10p to Midnight on Sunday. #NASCAR @BMSupdates
@brucemills911 @wxbrad NASCAR would never move the race up a day... @jeff_gluck @RaceWeather
.@WXBQMarcus @BMSupdates looks like it increases from late morning through afternoon and into the evening/night
#NASCAR weather forecast for @BMSupdates - still not looking good for SUN - rain incrs. day into evening.

@GOPfollowernate again we don't use radar to forecast - but right now timing is still  an issue.
@GOPfollowernate like I said earlier I don't like the looks but with lights and maybe an opening (still not sure) we could race Sun Night
@GOPfollowernate but just for radar to see where rain is and how it is moving I love RadarScope
@GOPfollowernate 1st radar is only a past/now tool. I was looking at various model guidance - both had rain most of the day
@HarpAmyStabler glad to help when we can...
@jrodz1 Plus I think like anyone depending on our mood and what we are working on we can/will be serious.
@Kschildknecht I'm not giving up either... I haven't said "washout" yet...
@jrodz1 I can be... LOL
@midtownexpress yeah a big one and people make sure I remember it... LOL Thanks for the support.
Think @RaceWeather &amp; @wxbrad would agree that changes are still poss. &amp; details will start to emerge the closer we get @BMSupdates
Here's my promise to all my followers - This account started by giving an honest forecast &amp; that will always be the case. Good or bad.
.@brucemills911 Scheduled for 1 pm. I know #NASCAR will wait out any rain as long as they can.
@_JonWood that's how all this started and in the last 7 years I've remained true to the philosophy I started. It's all about Fans
@_JonWood I was late this week with the forecast - the main job took priority
@Budfan4 I said there was a chance but I was always optimistic @Jeff_Gluck
@bobpockrass thanks... I'm with @wxbrad - Hope it changes but I do this for the fans who spend time/money to go to these races @RaceWeather
#NASCAR I don't like the forecast for SUN @bmsupdates it looks very wet - Will watch, still a lot of time for changes but not looking good
@mw55 @NASCAR @BMSupdates yeah but my forecast was correct last weekend...
@StephenieAlexSC where in ID?
Thank you all for understanding my delay on the @BMSupdates weather forecast. Had a strong system here in Idaho today. That's my focus
@Katblossindy @raceweather I will try tonight but had a strong storm with 40-50 mph and snow - crazy day
I do agree with @RaceWeather that Sunday looks drier than Saturday @BMSupdates - lots can change between now &amp; then #NASCAR
@CBWFAN I still have to work that's why we went out on Saturday. She works days I work nights.
I need 24-36 hrs before I put out @BMSupdates forecast - major weather event here in Idaho tomorrow - need to get through that
A lot of you are asking about @BMSupdates weather forecast &amp; thinking the worst. Remember how bad @TXMotorSpeedway looked to start last week
Today I celebrate 13 yrs married to an absolutely wonderful woman @mom2twinsplus1 here's to many more &amp; thank you 
@darrenmeeks88 I don't have one yet
@KendraJJacobs Yes it is your Birthday - hope it was a great day and a great weekend.
@hnewhouseracing Nice photo...
Out on anniversary dinner with @mom2twinsplus1 &amp; #NASCAR is on (may or may not have asked them to put it on) 
@nascarfanatic12 I'm out on my Anniversary with my wife...
Radar looks clear around @TXmotorspeedway I'm going out w/ @mom2twinsplus1 to celebrate 13 yrs of marriage - follow @RaceWeather for updates
Very happy birthday to @NASCARcasm - hope it's awesome
Given the current state of the radar around @Txmotorspeedway I'm growing more &amp; more confident we're dry tonight #NASCAR
@JOENOLES been ups since 8 am ET and now posted 3 times on Twitter
Here's my forecast for @TXMotorSpeedway tonight - will rain? You have to read 
Made @mom2twinsplus1 seriously blush - Costco cashier said “I watch you every night” my response “thanks for turning me on.”
If you missed it this morning here's my weather forecast for tonight 
#NASCAR @TXMotorSpeedway race day weather - can we race all the way? Details here 
Improving weather for the final 2 days of the #Masters - details here 
Chc. is low but remains for a passing storm or two tomorrow evening @TXMotorSpeedway confident we get this race in. 
Hope Mother Nature gives me an early wedding anniversary gift &amp; keep the rain away from @TXMotorSpeedway - Dinner w/ @mom2twinsplus1 SAT
While a storm/ or 2 can't be ruled out SAT @TXMotorSpeedway weather looks mostly dry. Still like 80-90% odds on complete race #NASCAR
@kenboyer2 been doing #Masters #PGA weather for 3 years now
#NASCAR @TXMotorSpeedway weather forecas - Let not your heart be troubled 
#Masters Weather forecast for Friday - Chance of storms late in the day at Augusta. 
@BlairMinton @Joe_Daddy_ dude you're good in my book. I don't know what they are talking about.
@ajbroadh2o_24 Possible, I am not ruling them out but I still think we get a race in Saturday
@Bignose996 @VerizonFiOS @weatherchannel I'd recommend your local weather media outlet. They'd be the best.
Like I said Tue we would see changes in the forecast. I believe we get a SAT night race #NASCAR 
@randomnascar Why not Saturday?
Radar over @TXMotorSpeedway #NASCAR 
#NASCAR @TXMotorSpeedway as we get closer to FRI &amp; SAT races the forecast continues to improve. I think we can get these races in.
#Masters weather forecast day one. Could storms cause problems later today? 
@WickedJ8 no angry would be the wife if I didn't treat her to a nice anniversary.
If rain is a problem on Saturday I may not be updating like I normally do. I will be celebrating my 13th wedding anniversary Sat. Night
@DAKOTAHAM53 I am saying it could be possible but there will be many many challenges.
@KyleBusch51Fan2 this is when I earn my followers when weather is bad.
I think we will have to deal with rain and storms THU-SAT @TXMotorSpeedway Still don't think "washout" but definitely going to keep me busy
@ryanvaughan looks like fun
I want to apologize for the lack of updates so far this week. Job and life right now are taking priority
@2448fan4life @TXMotorSpeedway and it's after midnight and I am leaving work,.
@2448fan4life @TXMotorSpeedway you and me both... I expect a lot of fine tuning and changes between now and then.
Not going "wash out" but storms &amp; rain are a concern THU-SAT @TXMotorSpeedway expect lots of fine tuning #NASCAR 
For those still up - looking @TXMotorSpeedway weather - think it looks worse than it will actually be. Challenging forecast
@STXJoy4 I think the forecasts that are out there are worst that what will actually happen.
@STXJoy4 Sadly I am not sure I have it this time, I am just now late at night getting to the forecast
@STXJoy4 I see you don't need me LOL
1st look at the @TXMotorSpeedway isn't all that great. Will have to deal with showers &amp; poss. storms THU-SAT. More info later... #NASCAR
@jim_utter I will try but Kate tonight I'll get something out
On #Wisconsin! Go #B1G!

For those curious about what I do when I am not doing #NASCAR weather or my main job. We stream our newscasts here 
@ezbugn1320 That I did see. thanks
@michelleclif Thank you and I believe they will I just don't like feeling the way I do
@Tina_Marie_88 It should. God has always looked out for my family and I
@Devin_Smrekar Thank you
I've honestly stayed away from this Twitter account all week. What was the biggest thing I missed in #NASCAR
Thank you all for the kind tweets - it does mean a lot. I just feel off &amp; I don't have #NASCAR weather this week to take my mind off it LOL
Just so everyone know - it's stress - but I have my health, family is great I have many blessings just some big time stress.
@freddyandfrieda I'm good just stress - I have a lot of blessings
Sorry I've been quiet -It's been a tough week personally - hope all of you are well
7-year-old rapper recaps 2015 #NASCAR season 
I'm SO not looking forward to the internet tomorrow (Wednesday April 1)
@Kenny_Wallace yeah @chesterlampkin is one of the good ones.
It's going to be nice to have the weekend off for Easter with #NASCAR
It’s been a very long time but giving blood this afternoon
Prayers &amp; positive thoughts for @KyleLarsonRacin as he will miss today's race 
Still chilly but not as cold today @MartinsvilleSwy 
#NASCAR @MartinsvilleSwy Race day weather forecast. Still nice &amp; a little warmer.... 
@Leslie88_48 I don't use them anyway... there is no rule on what we can or can not say.
Truth... It's chilly but could be worse RT @DebbieEGeorge: @jeff_gluck At least it's sunny and not snowing!
#NASCAR weekend weather forecast for @MartinsvilleSwy - You'll want a jacket. 
@2448fan4life it's going to come down to weather it rains or not. these showers could fade before getting to the track.
Another @MartinsvilleSwy radar update - we're not totally done - lingering showers could impact the rest of afternoon 
#NASCAR weather update @MartinsvilleSwy - back edge has moved through but still a few chances left this afternoon 
2015 NASCAR at Martinsville Speedway weather forecast: Not as nice as the West Coast 
#NASCAR morning weather update for @MartinsvilleSwy - take the rain gear for the morning it will be wet. Drier late… 
#NASCAR weather for @MartinsvilleSwy remains unchanged - showers Thu/Fri but dry and cool Sat/Sun
@ryanvaughan yeah I'm so in Junior Nation Weather authority  @DaleJr
@FNPNASCAR thank you so much.
#NASCAR weather @MartinsvilleSwy - Rain/storms THU &amp; FRI then dry SAT/SUN temps 45-55 for the weekend
@racefishenjoy nah I needed to start caring about the weather again... LOL
@ajbroadh2o_24 not that I see.
@bohicawarriors thank you.
#NASCAR first look @MartinsvilleSwy weather - It's improving - Sun &amp; clouds but on the cool side FRI-55 SAT-48 SUN-56
@Queenglamis they don't - I tend to be a dry sarcastic smart ass at times on here LOL
@roblefeber they are not no worries. My tweet was more tongue in cheek
@dexterdame LOL I knew what I was getting into. Gas meet fire LOL
@CBWFAN sadly weather forecasting also is an educated opinion
@ji711 i was busy earning my paycheck to really pay attention. Sorry
@jakegirard and that's why they are opinions &lt;wink&gt; I enjoyed the end of the race. I didn't have a horse in it so left emotion out
@WickedJ8 what was I thinking
Note to self - Stop having opinions and tweeting them - that is all.
@JamesAGentry I'm not making excuses. I just stated an opinion
@JamesAGentry if you followed my conversation and the one you responded (IN ALL CAPS) you'd see I did say it was questionable
@jwelle16 most races &amp; games are rarely remembered for the first 90%... The buzzer beater in the NCAA tourney or last second TD it's the end
@mattstureid I think @NASCARonFOX tried to show the first debris caution but it was hard to see. The second one from the 42 was legit
@jwelle16 I was being a smart ass LOL Sorry I was just joking. Most people don't remember 3 hours they remember the last 5-10 min
@mattstureid I disagree but but that's because I don't like seeing cars losing gas and slowing down. That's my opinion
@jwelle16 every race should be 3 laps we are done in 20 min maybe 10...
@jwelle16 that's the only thing anyone will remember or usually does remember. The finish is why they race anyway
@notbrikz I didn't type it...
@mattstureid that big piece from the 42 was BS? I will say I was surprised by the first one..
You know what - #NASCAR Fans you won today - That was a great race... @ACSupdates
Come on you know it's all part of #NASCAR conspiracy RT @jim_utter: That was definitely debris
#NASCAR if anything this will be interesting
@JennyDeVaughn hope all is going well, the kids look great...
@jackrlewis I just looked but haven't done any forecasting - I am at work so that comes first.

#AutoClub400 
Looks like it is going to be a challenging week forecasting for @MartinsvilleSwy - no details just yet... Stay tuned #NASCAR
Picture perfect weather for @ACSupdates lots of sunshine. Southwest wind 5-15 mph and temperatures 72-77 enjoy #NASCAR
This outstanding Idaho racer @hnewhouseracing needs help funding her NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West ride. 
#NASCAR @ACSpeedway weekend weather forecast. Yep it's that nice. 
Should have no weather concerns for @ACSupdates this weekend #NASCAR 
@ryanvaughan would have preferred a #Purdue Victory

@KevinHamlin when I played in the Purdue Band going to arenas that had basketball courts on top of ice, feet got cold fast.
@BoonieWest I am still bummed that Purdue (if they win against Cin) has to play Kentucky.
I wish making my picks for my NCAA brackets was as easy as making a weather forecast.
Looks like the #NASCARgoesWest weather continues to *AWESOME* Sunny FRI-SUN @ACSupdates highs near 80 #NASCAR
#NASCAR @ACSupdates - last week people were concerned about weather looks like more of the same for west coast swing
@RaceWeather hope school and work are going well.

No change in the weather forecast for @PhoenixRaceway - temps could hit 90 by Sunday. 
@DennisBJr865 of course this is at the end of the #NASCAR year 2017... right?
.@raider_wayne One week, one race at a time. I won't look at @ACSupdates weather until after @PhoenixRaceway
#NASCAR weather forecast for @PhoenixRaceway this weekend. Nice and very warm

@MattHartgrave as long as I'm not the subject (again)
@matthartgrave it tis a magical place
@rostrander13 @thatkimgirl @ACSupdates there's a reason I do it one week at a time. &amp; most TV stations use 7-day forecasts
@rostrander13 @thatkimgirl It's WAY WAY WAY too early for an accurate @ACSupdates forecast. I promise that will change many times
@rostrander13 are we talking about @ACSupdates or @PhoenixRaceway @thatkimgirl
@rostrander13 I don't know where you are getting these forecasts but I don't think they are correct. But what do I know @thatkimgirl
@thatkimgirl @rostrander13 Here's my forecast 
Thinking I like the #NASCAR West Coast Swing. Another winning forecast @PhoenixRaceway FRI-SUN sunny temps 85-90

@88meshell I'm 60-70% stomach bug is not fun and worse when working.
#NASCAR temperatures across @LVMotorSpeedway are low 70s but abundant sunshine on concrete/ asphalt make it hotter 
@iRainOnRaceDay I'm sick... Rumor has it @LVMotorSpeedway pays you off to keep the weather nice.
@LewisFranck nah it wasn't the first and technically we are ALL under the weather LOL
@LewisFranck worst thing ever getting a stomach bug on a #NASCAR weekend... &amp; Yes you are missed.
Thank you all for the well wishes... Feeling a little better but need to take it easy and low key...
#NASCAR Pre-race festivities continuing @lvmotorspeedway 
@jerrysan52 @AliciaPRNradio @jeff_gluck we're all "under the weather"
@AliciaPRNradio @jeff_gluck lol...
#NASCAR Sucked it up and made it to the track - in the infield care center now 
At least the weather is great for today's race - lots of sun (wear sunscreen) with temps 72-76 @LVMotorSpeedway #NASCAR
@BlairMinton @TheOrangeCone I wish that sounds more fun plus - I don't drink
Been sick all night - won't be going to the @LVmotorspeedway Tweetup but still trying to make it for the race

Beautiful weather @LVMotorSpeedway - great weather all weekend - sunscreen a must -#NASCAR 
Big thanks to @Kenny_Wallace for taking time to talk with me for a local story in doing on the importance of supporting local home tracks
You know you're on a #NASCAR trip when you see this in a bathroom and think the sign would be more effective yellow. 
@AccuFrank 8 hour car ride I drove 5 hours of it
@BoonieWest I ate @mom2twinsplus1 cooking last night #JustSaying
#NASCAR more spectacular weather tomorrow for @lvmotorspeedway

@B4caferacer wind is not an issue huge high ridge over the west.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @LVMotorSpeedway - sunny, nice and warm 
@sgsoutherngurl1 that just means people care - hope no major issues with that flight a glad to know you weren’t on it
@Ryan_Truex Congrats on the milestone...
@annoyingracefan @CitizenKBA I always predict the future...
@jerrysan52 @LVMotorSpeedway That is what I am seeing on Twitter today.
@annoyingracefan @TheOrangeCone I'm honored making the Top Five 2 times this season.
They say "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" Hope that's... 
@kenboyer2 I did it for free so it's one less thing I have to do during the week. I'm thinking of doing YouTube Videos
@kenboyer2 All that is happening is you won't HEAR my forecast on @SiriusXMNASCAR but I'm still HERE &amp; on @SBNation.
@StevenNewton18 I miss a few... I don't deny that but I work REALLY hard to be as accurate for the fans those who spend the $$$
@jdickIU We choked against OSU last week. I appreciate it I grew up just up the road from Bloomington. I'm from Martinsville.
@jdickIU That means a lot coming from a Hoosier... #BoilerUp LOL
Don't say this enough but "THANK YOU" for following me. Since day 1 my weather forecast focus has been you #NASCAR fans &amp; helping you
Missed the weather forecast for @LVMotorSpeedway don't worry no change, still AWESOME #NASCAR 
@TheOrangeCone followed you and joined  @NASCARonReddit

#NASCAR weather for lvmotorspeedway - picture perfect all weekend long 
@TheDalyPlanet just you know it wasn’t a NASCAR decision it was a Sirius/XM NASCAR channel decision as far as I know
@stevec105 it's not @PPistone fault..: him &amp; @TheMikeBagley are great it was just a decision @SiriusXMNASCAR
@jerrysan52 thanks for your support all is good here
@bamagreer I appreciate the support but @cpress75 doesn't care what I do or how I do it. It's ok like he said I'm one of many sources
@SamWalkerOBX I'm hoping I can continue with @PRNlive this season
@Malliard it didn't hurt my bottom line so I'm more disappointed like the crew of The Morning Drive
@LSUFAN869 I'm not stopping or ending NASCAR weather just no more on 
@SiriusXMNASCAR
@cpress75 that's cool I'm not for you but there are many who like what I do - have a good one
@cpress75 not necessarily if you really knew what info you were getting from those apps but you don't follow so it's not a big deal
@Tomzsports I'll be doing some work for the station so they may pay some stuff
.@bamagreer @TheDalyPlanet @NASCAR it wasn't #NASCAR air can from Sirius Management correct - tried to explain that
@cpress75 @norcocheermom @TheDalyPlanet @NASCAR well I have a good/accurate reputation with NASCAR media/teams/drivers &amp; fans
@spalmer88 my reports will still be here and on SBnation
@Tomzsports yeah it's being paid for by me
All that has happened is I won't be on "The Morning Drive" my forecast aren't going anywhere. Still tweeting &amp; @SBnation
@TheDalyPlanet it wasn't just me it was @WeatherGalCass I have a theory that maybe Sirius has a deal with another weather provider
@D_Ruhestand @TheDalyPlanet @NASCAR I'd put my forecast accuracy against anyone
@AllMilitaryNews thanks

@Ocsret @LVMotorSpeedway I leave Friday morning
@TheOrangeCone my favorite was 2-3 years ago and the @KyleBusch running over you. 
@MISroger met you a few times @MISpeedway love the track. Now being out west hard to get back to one.
@munafo @LVMotorSpeedway is working on something.
@CaptComeback sent a dm
So who's going to @LVMotorSpeedway this weekend? I'll be there &amp; looking forward to the tweetup too.
@MISroger thanks for your support and get well soon.
@longshotranch she's been nice enough to have me on her show when weather has been an issue.
@longshotranch I still have my main job I wasn't paid any way just a weekly thing I did
@DJsplitter what' a rumor?
@Fitz_61 I wasn't paid so the joke's on them...
#NASCAR weather forecast @LVMotorSpeedway - it doesn't get much better than this 
@jkeyeser myself @WeatherGalCass were both told this week by our shows producers they aren't having meteorologists on.
My #NASCA weather forecasts are still here on Twitter - always on @SBNation as well as Facebook &amp; right now @PRNlive #NotGoingAway
@JHuchingson I am independent I got that gig cause of this account this isn't going anywhere
@DaleJrsCar I'll still do it here and via @SBNation
- @reddog94 don't boycott @SiriusXMNASCAR I wasn't paid anyway I did it voluntary - The Morning Drive crew supports me &amp; wanted me to stay
@Andrew8468 @TheDalyPlanet @WeatherGalCass yeah it was a @SiriusXMNASCAR decision no Meteorologists
@damiEnbowman this was a station decision no meteorologists on their shows
This was not a personal decision on me - my understanding is @SiriusXMNASCAR will no longer have meteorologists on their station/shows
I want everyone to know this was NOT a decision by the great producer and staff of #NASCARTMD &amp; hopefully this is just temporary
@LauraSueHenshaw this isn't going anywhere not is my weather on @SBNation
I need to thank @PPistone &amp; @TheMikeBagley for their support - this wasn't a decision from them @SiriusXMNASCAR #TMDNASCAR
Just got word I'm no longer going to be providing #NASCAR weather for @SiriusXMNASCAR #TMDNASCAR this was a management decision.
@nsj hoping myself and the rest of us don't get it
Took the day off to take son to the doctors. He has strep
@blackhawks4343 I'll be @LVMotorSpeedway this weekend
@jerrysan52 I've know @BuckyBirt for a few years now. Also did his radio show once.
@BuckyBirt I'm in guess we could work with @LVMotorSpeedway too
@BuckyBirt I'm going to be there and I will be in the Media Center
@BuckyBirt neither one will be there...
@jerrysan52 I don't know it's been a year...
Hey @lvmotorspeedway what's your plan for a Tweetup this weekend?
Absolutely ZERO weather concerns this week @LVMotorSpeedway. Just need the sunscreen. Temps in the 70s. #NASCAR
@NASCAR__Xfinity weather looks great this weekend @LVMotorSpeedway plus I’ll be there this weekend too #NASCAR
@nascarcasm useless but thanks for doing it. Will you be in Vegas?
@_JonWood ok cool in there from Friday night and we head back Monday morning

@_JonWood are you in Vegas this weekend? I'll be there
@_JonWood hey stranger - hope you are doing well

Jimmie Johnson wins 2015 Folds of Honor Quiktrip 500 @AMSupdates 
@ArMcG88 @TheOrangeCone I said we'd get a full complete race?
Forecast was good but weather wasn't (Too cold). Welcome new followers. As always thank you to those who have followed me a long time.
@iRainOnRaceDay nope -the weather forecast says otherwise @queers4gears
@queers4gears i hear you are out of town next weekend.. Bummer.
@jerrysan52 not gloating... fact saying we nailed the forecast that was gloating.
@19FanGirl19 well hi LOL and thanks
@JakeScoggins88 Crash
@bamagreer I lose it sometime. I am better and plan in my 6th season is to be more patient.

Under red flag... at least it's not because of weather.
kind of bummed - finding out some of my #NASCAR media friends won't be @LVMotorSpeedway next weekend. Still excited about going
@MissouriSenior @LVMotorSpeedway Myself and a buddy from work @MattHartgrave will be there
And if you missed it earlier - The weather for next weekend @LVMotorSpeedway looks fantastic. All three days #NASCAR
Thoughts on the race?
@TheRealPest @3X824 doubtful huh? Good thing I stuck with my forecast
If you are around Macon, GA follow &amp; watch WGXA-TV meteorologist @WxManJeffCox - good meteorologist and even better friend
@RaceWeather @WxManJeffCox @weathersfuori isn't it Coopatition LOL
People are very outspoken when we miss a forecast but I want to say we did a great job today @RaceWeather @WxManJeffCox @weathersfuori
#NASCAR forecast for the second half of the race - more of the same - cloudy, 40-45, damp. Could still get more drizzle @AMSupdates
@Ang4the15 Same, cloudy cold dreary and light mist. but no racing problems.
@LauraSueHenshaw as I said earlier - with mist/ drizzle &amp; fog radar is useless. But it is damp &amp; will remain that way
@tboneadams24 i just said... Look at previous tweets.
.@andyacr not worried about any additional rain just this damp mist and maybe a pocket of heavier drizzle. Still think we go 100%
That doesn't mean I've given up on a complete race. I still feel good we get the whole thing in. #NASCAR
I know we all want a complete race but I'm cheering for lap 163 #Official #NASCAR
Here you go @iRainOnRaceDay @Sprint_Narwhal @RaceWeather 
Here you go @iRainOnRaceDay @Sprint_Narwhal @RaceWeather 
@jerrysan52 Feel like that limb is made of Titanium
@RaceWeather #NASCAR needs to have us at more tracks.
@NASCAR_Hula @reviewjournal Thanks it's exactly what I just said a min ago.
Normally I don't do this but I'll be @LVMotorSpeedway next SUN. Weather will be opposite of @amsupdates next week Sunny &amp; 70s #NASCAR
So far no change to the weather @AMSupdates - cold, damp w/ a foggy mist should continue most of the afternoon #NASCAR
Just an FYI for this afternoon. Radar is essentially useless when it comes to pockets of mist and drizzle. It's too low for radar to see.
@weathersfuori @RaceWeather @WxManJeffCox agree... but I still think we can get a complete race in. #FingersCrossed
@spadilly its been there you can add locations.
@bobpockrass happy birthday... Thanks for all your support.
Forecast this afternoon, is cold, dreary &amp; damp. pockets of mist &amp; drizzle still possible this afternoon but think we can get this done.
@GuruGarrow @Riceman61 @competitiverob @RacingGuy @prnbrett @WendyVenturini @SteveRichards57 @BradGillie @PRNlive have a great broadcast
@Blondenevadan we don't arrive until late Friday
@Blondenevadan no she isn't
@Blondenevadan probably due to low ceiling
@Blondenevadan I'll be there once again...
@Blondenevadan been too busy with @AMSupdates weather... LOL
@Blondenevadan good to see you too.
conditions I'm seeing around @AMSupdates is cloudy, dreary &amp; cold temp just near 40 degrees.
If you are @AMSupdates I'd love any reports you have. In conditions like these ground reports are better than any radar.
tough thing about drizzle/mist - Usually can't see it on radar. To low to the ground. Still expect some through early PM #NASCAR
@RacecarEngineer @amsupdates ground clutter &gt; rain
@KatblossIndy @jim_utter be careful some of these blips you see near @AMSupdates is ground clutter meaning they aren't rain.
Anymore rain/drizzle today? Poss. but it should remain mostly dry
Do we get a complete race today? Yes #NASCAR
Radar dry around @amsupdates - blips near track NOT rain but what we call ground clutter. Drying cont. #NASCAR 
@B4caferacer @jayski yes still think they get race in today been saying that all week
Bulk of the rain/ drizzle moved out but ISO. areas remain - delays still poss. this afternoon drier cond. likely late afternoon/ evening
@joffutt1 all love &amp; respect for @jeff_gluck there wouldn't be NASCAR weatherman without Jeff
Lgt rain/drizzle moving out. Might start on time but weather delays still poss. Still confident we see complete rac… 
@NASCAR_WXMAN: You'll want rain gear today but I still think we race @AMSupdates today - here's what to expect 
Here's my #NASCAR race day weather forecast for... 
You'll want rain gear today but I still think we race @AMSupdates today - here's what to expect
#NASCAR race day weather forecast for @AMSupdates - chance of rain &amp; drizzle what are the impacts? 
Ok 2am MT for me time to get some sleep.
@GrifithRoger its straight down Nevada and boring high Nevada Desert
Recorded my @PRNlive weather forecast for today's broadcast. Hope they use it.
@GrifithRoger 8 hour drive
@MattWeaverSBN Sleep what is that?
@GrifithRoger We have a NASCAR home track here in Twin Falls. I will be in Vegas this coming weekend. That's about it.
@GrifithRoger they are now the title sponsor for what was Nationwide. they are some TV on demand service from Comcast
@GrifithRoger @amsupdates it could be earlier - it's a difficult forecast - bottom line they should race today
#NASCAR race day weather forecast for @AMSupdates - how will rain impact today's race? 
@freddyandfrieda @SBNation @amsupdates @jeff_gluck that was soooooo last Thursday
I give the odds of #NASCAR racing tomorrow to be around 60-70% delays are possible but looks drier late day/evening
@dalefan34ever I hate this forecast - it is a TOUGH one. I still give odds of racing tomorrow around 60-70%
@Hookem_Bream11 @BoonieWest weather apps have their place. (I won't say where LOL) they tend to be just 1 computer model
@Hookem_Bream11 @BoonieWest people still make sure I know what the weather app says.
@BoonieWest thanks - I have 6 years and nearly 14 years of doing weather. I'd be more worried if I said NO RAIN and it actually did rain.
@AndrewGortonWx correct...
@AndrewGortonWx I think there could be a break by the afternoon/evening. Enough to dry and race.
if you say so... RT @BoonieWest: And if it rains NASCAR nation will lynch YOU for it. @NASCAR_WXMAN @SBNation @amsupdates
@GBW2421 yes, drizzle light rain most during the morning. Think towards afternoon we can get this in. Hoping sooner than later
Working on my @SBNation #NASCAR weather forecast for Sunday @AMSupdates
@D_Ruhestand Hey - I wasn't making fun of people I agree that having a Mar #ATL race makes no sense. Just pointed out rain at both locals
@NASCAR_Wonka @NitroHZ @amsupdates I don't watch...
@NASCAR_Wonka @NitroHZ @amsupdates #DVR
Do we race tomorrow? YES
Will there be delays? More than Likely
Can we get a COMPLETE race? Yes @AMSupdates has lights 
#NASCAR
@D_Ruhestand honestly I don't think it was smart to have it in March at Atlanta.
@D_Ruhestand @amsupdates no I didn't make fun of them. All I said was this year rain was likely in PHX as well as ATL..
#NASCAR @AMSupdates weather forecast - delay is poss. to start the race. drizzle/rain dim. by afternoon/evening. Should race tomorrow
#NASCAR weather update. Sticking patchy drizzle tomorrow. Still think we can race but with delays @AMSupdates 
Some slight improvement for the #NASCAR weather forecast @AMSUpdates details here --&gt; 
@rdj_1 @amsupdates I only forecast weather. That's weird enough for me.
#NASCAR late night working on @AMSupdates. Increasing ODDS OF RACING on SUN from 50% to near 75% -Threat of drizzle/rain diminishing
@nascarStatsguy that's not my latest weather report. I don't comment on other weather forecasts not knowing the source
@jbruce1957 @amsupdates I didn't give 50% chance of rain I said 50% of RACING...
Want to say while I expect drizzle &amp; chc of light rain Sun @AMSUpdates I'm cautiously optimistic we can/will race.
#NASCAR @AMSupdates weather forecast - How will rain/drizzle impact the race weekend? 
@STXjoy4 it's all about distraction
@STXJoy4 I do too... I remember there was once this group called ISIS @NASCARBTW
@DAKOTAHAM53 50%
Between learning about #Llamas and #TheDress colors I feel like this... 
This ---&gt; RT @annoyingracefan: @NASCAR_WXMAN AND YOU MADE THE TOP FIVE. (And argued weather forecasting with sports guys)
@vegangymmie actually it was @NASCAR_WXMAN that blew up
Wish I didn't have to work and could have gone #Boise RT @altonbrown: #AltonBrownLive 
So I missed out on #Llamas &amp; #whatcoloristhisdress - I call that a good day...
@nascarcasm If it weren't for your tweets I wouldn't have know about #llamas or #Dresses
@ryanvaughan I can talk around 10:35 CT I'm in my 9pm broadcast.
@codymathvb Honestly... Drizzle is so tough... That's why I have the odds at 50% for racing.
@codymathvb it's cold air wedge in place with warmer moist air moving over it that will cause light rain/drizzle.
@defyingteresa 
@defyingteresa you retweeted my tweet that gave the odds of racing Sunday.
@Klyn_Powell1979 @amsupdates If I could make it nice I would...
A lot of you are asking about Monday. Depends on what data you look at. It's not as clear cut at this point, but looks wetter
@robertrich @amsupdates I'd expect at least some kind of delay or red flag. Yeah that 50% is to at least an official race.
#NASCAR weather forecast @AMSupdates - areas of drizzle/lgt. rain SUN. Chilly. Odds of racing SUN 50% 
very cool @mom2twinsplus1 RT @paulcam87920573: My new coffee mug @BarnabyEdwards one side @NicholasPegg the other :-D 
@ArguablyDefined @annoyingracefan @jeff_gluck don't give away our secrets.
@annoyingracefan it won't be the last time someone promises 7-10 inches and doesn't deliver.
@annoyingracefan except @Jeff_Gluck he is at war with weather people LOL
@annoyingracefan yes I am ignorant... What did I make the top 5 for?
@MikeUnJoy possible steady light drizzle or rain forming
@darkwingj again it's too difficult to tell. This easily could be a nowcast type of situation. Drizzle is very hard to forecast
@darkwingj Nothing looks particularly good... I am really hoping we can get at least an official one in Sunday
Damp Dreary Drizzle &amp; cold are the words to describe SUN weather @AMSupdates - Odds of racing 50% - Hi 40-45 - Expect delays #NASCAR
@midtownexpress That was the biggest one I whiffed on.
@ToddAitchison @Noble_Jim that is funny and I feel bad for my colleagues
@Noble_Jim @Noble_Jim Got my forecast right here in Idaho so I'm happy. We get them wrong (see my July Daytona Forecast) but we do our best
@SmamuelRichard @jeff_gluck We don't purchase any models... That's not true. We have no connection to anything we aren't allowed in TV News.
@Noble_Jim I still appreciate the help @IMS back in 2011 thank you @TRDFan1
@mjmpgh apparently - Our sports person gets 4-6 min I get 3 min for weather @Noble_Jim
@jeff_gluck Sometimes when it comes to a forecast you're only as good as the data + experience. If the data is way off so will the forecast
Lots of respect for both @Jeff_Gluck &amp; @Noble_Jim but like to see them write their race stories days in advance &amp; see how right they are LOL
@weathersfuori @jeff_gluck When it comes to winter storms always air on the side of caution. Prepare for the worst hope for best
@weathersfuori @jeff_gluck I agree that's a little harsh. Wasn't an easy forecast.
#NASCAR weather for @AMSupdates - Sticking with  my current forecast - Chc. of rain SUN but still not a washout 
@cheftelle thank you for your support I'm going to stay out of this conversation
@ntoutland I haven't ruled out Sunday yet.
@ntoutland @possum232002 @RaceWeather @WxManJeffCox I don't comment on other forecasts especially from weather apps
@possum232002 @RaceWeather @WxManJeffCox Let's see if we can get through SUN day before we think about night.
Dry THU-SAT but chilly. Remains chilly SUN but chance of lgt rain &amp; maybe drizzle for @AMSupdates #NASCAR 
@amafera The Winter Storm Warning is cancelled.
Event cancelled. Winter Storm Warning from 2/25/2015 8:44 PM  to 2/26/2015 10:00 AM EST for @AMSupda… Read more at 
I don't use percent chances of rain &amp; here's why 
@DebRocket I don't know what forecast you are looking at &amp; I don't comment on other forecasts. Here are my thoughts 
@Mel4the24 I hope you have a happy birthday
@ShaunSieloff Hey I look at all I can. I have no issue with a person being as informed as they can especially if traveling &amp; paying $$$
Been talking with @RaceWeather &amp; @WxManJeffCox about this weekend's forecast. All agree not a wash but concerned about rain/drizzle chances
I do my own forecast and work.  A lot of you want to send me other outlets and people's forecast. I won't comment on them thank you.
@WickedJ8 was trying to delete on phone and hit send instead
@WickedJ8 where are you getting SNOW No one is mentioning snow.
Biggest concern for @AMSupdates Sunday - Drizzle &amp; light rain. New data not promising but not a wash either. Hi 48 #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather for Thu-Sat @AMSupdates will be chilly but dry. Patchy fog tomorrow otherwise sun &amp; clouds high 45-48
@_matthewfitz that's not my forecast and I don't comment on other people's or weather app forecasts
The bottom line this is a very difficult &amp; challenging forecast @AMSupdates lots will change but it is dreary/chilly SUN w/ chc rain/drizzle
@danzy678 appreciate the endorsement just had to give you a hard time
@danzy678 how about a follow from you too lol  @Bflakes1428
@ArtistNancyNuce @amsupdates @jeff_gluck I do my own forecast I don't comment on other forecasts. Especially computer generated ones
@3X824 @amsupdates it doesn't look all that bad. If it holds we've raced with worst forecasts before
@mrsfaz16 @BoonieWest @amsupdates weather channel app is just raw unfiltered data. No human does that forecast
At first glance the weather for @AMSupdates this SUN Does NOT look like a wash. Chc. Of showers &amp; chilly. Will have more later #NASCAR
@boonieWest they always do
I haven't had time to look at the @AMSupdates forecast yet this morning. My plan is later today...
@RonChilders good luck on the forecast limb...
@burtonb3 I don't see a rain out at this time. I will really know more &amp; a better idea tomorrow. The forecast has been changing a lot
@_matthewfitz I understand... I will have more details and a better idea tomorrow.
@_matthewfitz Right now too early for exact details on this forecast - They keep changing. I didn't put out 50% in any forecast
@Lowe82G @amsupdates I heard the test was on Thursday and it's looking dry... How am I saying it won't happen?
@C_hallway24 @JenDeach88 Here is what I tweeted a few hours ago... 
@kenny_wallace I liked how you had Joey at 22 it matched his car. #WorkedForMe lol
@HarpAmyStabler @JenJoCobb what @wxbrad said...
Kind of wishing for either the reset button OR a FF button on the day...
@SluggerLabbe Unless it's race weekend I leave #NCwx &amp; #CLTwx to @wxbrad
@mr_ghostman I'm a local TV meteorologist in Twin Falls, ID. National outlets paint with a big brush. Your locals would know more for you
@mr_ghostman @amsupdates that came from AccuWeather... I'd rely more on your locals than that...
@amsupdates @peyton_quick It's too early for exact details &amp; it's a challenging forecast but I have Chc. showers &amp; 50 Sunday
For those wondering about @AMSupdates tomorrow... Here's a weather map. 
Not much change to @AMSupdates weather THU/FRI look dry but chilly 45-48. SAT is dry nr 50 | Chc. of showers SUN hi 51 #NASCAR
@JesseDJames88 still early a lot can and will change over the next couple of days.
@WickedJ8 got the Brian part right...
@msharleyluxury my point the forecast for Phoenix this weekend isn't better than Atlanta.
@Cammer88 I pride myself on checking &amp; double checking my info before I tweet it.
@Cammer88 thanks agreed. I have had a good day and I have one more show before my night is over.
@bohicawarriors it was more confusing the weather tabs I had open while also doing my job.
@rileyandxander thank you...
@JEH317 I'm an Indy native too. I work in Twin Falls, ID and was in a broadcast as I was tweeting. Have too many weather tabs up
@JEH317 @jeff_gluck I am sorry, I quickly looked at the wrong info. That is all on me. Trying to do my job and Tweet NASCAR
I made a mistake - I looked at the wrong info. Mixed up locations, this is all on me. I made the mistake and I am sorry.
Want to apologize to @Jeff_Gluck &amp; others who retweeted my post about @PhoenixRaceway/ @AMSUpdates While Phoenix looks wet it is NOT colder
@annoyingracefan I was actually wrong on something so I need to correct myself.
@JEH317 my bad... you are correct I was wrong.
@ryanvaughan When's the Winter Dome going to hit my house?
@JEH317 I'm out west I've looked at the weather for both locations and RIGHT NOW the forecast for Phoenix actually looks colder/wetter SUN.
@JEH317 I didn't mean on average or all the time... I was just comparing this weekends weather for the two locations.
If you missed my tweets - here's my current thoughts on @amsupdates weather THU-SUN. I expect changes #NASCAR 
@MikeUnJoy I don't do percent chances but I have THU-SAT holding dry with chance of showers on SUN.
@ElliottFan4Life but most people were using the weather forecast for @AMSupdates this weekend to back up their argument against
@dextermorgan5 maybe not but if #NASCAR was there this weekend it would still be potentially as bad.
Not saying that. Too much time for that forecast to change between now &amp; Sunday RT @kcr45: @NASCAR_WXMAN so wash out
@WxManJeffCox I just tweeted that @PhoenixRaceway doesn't look any better this weekend.
@WxManJeffCox at this point I agree with your @AMSupdates weather forecast.
@kcr45 with low to mid 50s on Sunday I'd say rain. I'm only looking at THU-SUN
Temperatures THU, FRI &amp; SAT are 45 to 50 degrees and SUN 53-58 @AMSupdates #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather for @AMSupdates at first glance. Right now - THU FRI &amp; SAT looks dry but chc. of rain SUN expect it to change.
Looking over data for this weekend's race @AMSupdates &amp; it is going to be challenging &amp; change a lot between now &amp; Sunday.
@sgsoutherngurl1 Happy Birthday... Hope it was a great day.
@Kenny_Wallace Hey sent you a DM - Need a favor...
If there was one thing I was going to see on the #Oscars I am so glad it was the performance of "Everything Is Awesome" #Lego
@RoninLincoln almost stayed at the @HootersCasinoLV... @iRainOnRaceDay
Yes I am and looking forward to it. RT @RoninLincoln: @NASCAR_WXMAN Are you going to Vegas in two weeks?
Should be a fun week of forecasting for @amsupdates - @RaceWeather
Thanks for making the kick off to the 2015 #NASCAR season so much fun here on Twitter.
Already looking at the @AMSupdates weather forecast &amp; right now no consensus on model data. Going to be a challenging week.
good question RT @godwinkelly: how many green=white=checkers will we see? #Daytona500
Wow Twitter is nearly 30-45 seconds ahead of my broadcast.
So far everyone is playing nice and being smart... How much longer does it last? #NASCAR
@Yvonne388 I actually agree with you...
@MyLadysSword we are good we also have a younger son all are good.
@chrispath1 I actually hate them...
Current winds across @DISupdates - Reporting station at the track... Northeast 4 mph gusting to 11 mph. 
@TXracegirl48 @nascarcasm maybe it was actually a #Narwhal
@nascarcasm it sounded good LOL
@nascarcasm Mermaids are known for placing curses.
Last week @iRainOnRaceDay was doing a lot of talking... Seems like he is MIA today... #NASCAR
IMO The movie "Chappie" is a post apocalyptic Johnny Five
@nascar_girl_24 Thanks I am good it's 29 here in Twin Falls, ID
For those missing the #Narwhals #NASCAR 
So at lap 39 and yet to see the #Narwhals
@Riceman61 I was thinking the same thing #Narwhals
Got to give @Matt_Crafton credit no runs in that #18 and keeping it right up there. #NASCAR
Want to send positive thoughts and prayers to @SamanthaBusch &amp; @KyleBusch - Get Well Kyle hope to see you back on track soon.
#NASCAR Its already running warmer than I thought. Could easily be in the low 80s during the race disupdates 
One more time #NASCAR weather forecast for the #Daytona500 
I've made my weather prediction... Who's your pick for today's #Daytona500 #NASCAR?
@MorganKIRO7 it is we get most of our water from the Tetons it's been good there but through the Panhandle and Western ID not so much
It definitely is... Not cold and Not Wet RT @EddieDHondt: Kid Rock doin it !!  Beautiful day here @DISupdates 
@MorganKIRO7 @JeffGordonWeb 1994 He won the first Brickyard 400 being an Indy kid that was a big deal.
@MorganKIRO7 We actually saw flakes in the air last night and wind chill is in the teens today.
@MorganKIRO7 I've never been either. Loved to go trying to figure out a sweeps piece or coverage to go LOL
@MorganKIRO7 I've always tried to stay neutral but with this being his last year, I've been open that I started as a @JeffGordonWeb fan
I'm ready and so excited about today's #Daytona500 #NASCAR
@wxbrad yeah no threat of severe storms... Nice break. Now we have to worry about @amsupdates next weekend
@jfcassidy Thank you.. Really wish I could make it like this every weekend.
@wxmc and here's to wishing...
@wxbrad you going to the race?
No rain today, sun &amp; clouds, nice &amp; warm... I say it's a good day for a Daytona 500 #NASCAR 
@WilliamReed1 you wanted to hear from me? 
Weatherwise - It's going to be a good day...  #NASCAR @DISUpdates 
@Jordan_Bianchi Hey how do I get my forecast on the NASCAR front page of @SBNation.
#NASCAR Daytona 500 race day weather - Could we see another stray shower? Find out here 
#NASCAR weather forecast for the Daytona 500. I think this one is nice, warm &amp; DRY 
Glad to see him responsive hoping @KyleBusch is ok #NASCAR positive thoughts and energy
Is it just me or does @KevinHarvick look a little uncomfortable in a shirt and tie? May be me not used to seeing him like that
@thiagorsr Did you READ the tweet? "but rain does not appear to be a threat"
There may be clouds but rain does not appear to be a threat... 
Looking at radar 3:37 pm ET looks like a cell south of @DISupdates moving very slowly #NASCAR 
There's still a chc of passing shower/sprinkle this afternoon but shouldn't be a huge issue... Will monitor #NASCAR
#NASCAR rest of today - clouds/sun small Chc. ISO sprinkle/shower mainly dry. Similar SUB but not worried bout weather
@turnpiketurk I'd say NO there could be but likelihood is very very low. I hate most weather apps.
#NASCAR Hey #Narwhals fans... You're Welcome #Sprint 
@LauraSueHenshaw I'm not... I mentioned them in my @SBNation article.
To put the forecast in perspective &amp; defend my FL weather colleagues - Locations within 2 miles of @DISupdates will see no rain today.
@DGodfatherMoody you know since those locals are out of Orlando... If it doesn't rain in Orlando they will claim win
@DGodfatherMoody thanks for following and I knew what you were taking about with the "0% chance of rain" I enjoy your stuff
@nascardamus well bragging because people blasting weather people on the forecast today
@jerrysan52 @DGodfatherMoody follows both @Raceweather and I and we both mention rain
@2448fan4life we should easily get it in
Another sprinkle/light rain could form but as of right now there is no additional threat #NASCAR
@bs_bennett oh sorry I didn't get that joke my bad
If anyone read my forecast from this morning I did mention a Chc. of isolated shower today 
@bs_bennett if you read my forecast I had a chance of an isolated rain today #NASCAR 
It's very light &amp; only shower... #NASCAR 
@RyanLMcCollough I totally understand it just makes life easier for me to keep it one race at a time.
@RyanLMcCollough one race weekend at a time
#NASCAR People asked me about dark clouds near @DISupdates - 12:05 looks like no more than sprinkles/ Lgt. Shower 
#NASCAR @DISupdates weather forecast. Threat of rain has practically disappeared 
Looks like a dry weekend @DISupdates. If we get a shower it's later today &amp; even that threat is low. #NASCAR 
this was fun - What #NASCAR spotters really think 
NASCAR suspends Kurt Busch 
@jkeyeser you think I'm wrong
#NASCAR Weather forecast for this weekend is warmer with highs 73 on SAT &amp; 78 on SUN - also going DRY both days &amp; P.sunny #Enjoy
With my next forecast update for @DISupdates this weekend I'm going to take out the mention of rain for SUN. #NASCAR
#NASCAR Daytona 500 weather forecast. Rain? I think you'll like the forecast 
@2448fan4life @DISupdates the threat is very small but felt it was at least worth a mention.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @DISupdates - No changes for the weekend 
@letos_refuge It was just an opinion. Random thought. I am ok with being wrong on this
@D_Ruhestand like I said it was an opinion...
Hate seeing this for Idahoan native @bscottracing - Maybe he can pull this out...
@outerbanker1 their like butt holes.
@I_AM_BEARMAN and that's A-OK it's just an opinion
In my opinion - #NASCAR needs @DanicaPatrick in the Daytona 500.
Totally agree but hate doesn't seem strong enough RT @jeff_gluck: I. HATE. NARWHALS.
@wmoyer650 I was pretty right on. I took it on the chin for the July Daytona race but I felt last year was solid but thanks I get it now
@wmoyer650 one race one Daytona race I was wrong... My season accuracy was 70-80%
@Tomzsports Any win in the B1G is good but also against your Rival twice at their home is also big.
@wmoyer650 what? excuse me?
Way to go #Boilers!!!! Big Win over Indiana... Swept the #Hoosiers #Purdue...
Personally this is one of the driest Daytona 500 forecast we've seen since 2011 #NASCAR
Sticking with my forecast this weekend. Overall it's mostly dry &amp; much warmer highs 73-78. Iso. Chc. of showers #NASCAR
Temps will only continue to fall tonight #NASCAR #BudweiserDuel 
@Leslie88_48 Irony... We are in our local FOX Newscast.

@AppFlyer @wxrjm technically there weren't any last year LOL I really feel like this year is dry and good.
@medge70 you too...
@wxrjm now you jinxed it
Threat of rain SUN is VERY SMALL but with an onshore flow it's worth a mention of a pop up shower. Drier than previous 500s
@armond_ealey @DISupdates @iRainOnRaceDay Not really the threat is very low only at mention stage. More than likely a no show.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @DISupdates - Cool THU &amp; FRI | Warm SAT &amp; SUN - MOSTLY DRY chc. of iso. showers SUN

@jessepotter @jeff_gluck Never said it was a washout. All I've said is there's a chc. Accuracy &amp; details get better as we get closer
@Joturn33 @DISupdates overall I agree but rather take rain out as we get closer than add it in
@KCJO388579 @jeff_gluck @DISupdates that chance is very small. Easier to take rain OUT of a forecast than add it. It looks mostly dry SUN
@bowen1953 @DISupdates I don't make the garbage... But right now this doesn't look like any kind of problem. Hope it stays that way.
Happy Birthday @MattWeaverSBN hope it has been a great day
Little has changed in my #NASCAR weather forecast for @DISUpdates next 5 days. Still small chc. SUN 
@mom2twinsplus1 want to join me at 11pm?
@armond_ealey maybe @IHOP at 11 pm tonight
National Pancake Day and I haven't gotten any pancakes. I'm slipping.
cause a lot of drag RT @4cast4you: You've got to be kidding me. RT @RickRalphTSN Brother sent this pic from NS. 
@Estebones88 friend, colleague and very good meteorologist
@Tomzsports Put in for my credentials but @MattHartgrave and I got our hotel.
@Matt2Harrington I'll have a new forecast out later tonight but this is still pretty accurate... 
@Matt2Harrington 72-76
=@Tomzsports I'll see you @LVMotorSpeedway again?
@JOENOLES I've had several updates.. Just go through my twitter stream. Will have a more detailed forecast tonight...
Looked at the newest forecast data for @DISUpdates this weekend. Remaining MOSTLY DRY - Sun &amp; Clouds very small chc. of a shower SUN #NASCAR
#NASCAR 2015 Preview from @Jordan_Bianchi 
A lot of people have asked me &amp; @RaceWeather about Fantasy #NASCAR league. You want to sign up you can here - 
@AllMilitaryNews No, because no one knows where it is...
Figures the one day I don't do a forecast for #DisneyWorld RT @nascarcasm: Is pretty much every #NASCAR driver at Disney World right now?
@nascarcasm I really want to know Clint Bowyer's thoughts on "It's a Small World"
@HarpAmyStabler @DISupdates @bn9weather I sew something that warrants a mention. The likelihood is low but I felt it needed mention
Rain/storms later tonight @DISupdates then dry through Sat. Still only slight (small) chc. Of showers SUN. Still looking mostly dry #NASCAR
@JeffGordonDoll thanks
@Jordan_Bianchi I don't know this tweet falls a little flat...
@jerrysan52 Actually I am NOT booked @Southpointlv - it was way more than @MattHartgrave &amp; I could afford. Would have loved too
@SpringWolf Sorry I missed the broadcast... Work kept me from listening in.
@wxbrad wow we are almost 10-15 degrees warmer than you here in Idaho this week. #DeathRidge
@GoGreenRacing sent you a DM
Excited... Booked my hotel for @LVMotorSpeedway weekend. #NASCAR
@ToddModderman we like to call that a Zamboni Warning on Area roadways #CLT
Here's the rest of my #NASCAR weather forecast for @DISupdates. Small chc on Sunday but mostly dry 
Weather outlook for @DISupdates this SUN is mostly dry. There's a very small slight chc. of rain but not worried at this point. #NASCAR
@Dale_Jr_Nation in my opinion no. The app and online is a model spitting out data. No human filter
I'm not calling for a washout. I saw  something that made mention a chc. of showers. Still to far out for details.
@Dale_Jr_Nation i won't be checking the weather channel
@armond_ealey @DISupdates Honestly I'd rather take rain out of the forecast than add it back in
Right now, overall forecast for @DISupdates &amp; #D500 is dry but mentioning a "slight chance" of rain Sunday. #NASCAR 
Jeff Gordon's day of celebration overshadowed by group qualifying debacle #NASCAR 
@jerrysan52 absolutely it looks dry could be dry. Maybe it's past 500s. I go back to 2012 the Monday night race. It was dry a week out
@richardpbelisle I'm not 100% confident its dry I'm like 60% confident its dry
@richardpbelisle i never said rain just have some doubts right now. 7 days are never accurate
#NASCAR @DISUpdates outlook. Rain arrives TUE pm into WED
Mostly Dry THU, FRI &amp; SAT 
SUN (right now) looks mostly dry BUT not confident
@BombersportsUK trust me there is so much WRONG than right. I was at least giving them credit for excitement
@Bababooey18 they never leave... Some might but most stick around...
@OverCastle definitely didn't like the Pit road traffic jam
How is that any different than any other tweet? LOL RT @Estebones88: You said a whole lot of nothing then Brian.
@OverCastle I was like 70% not liking it and 30% liking the excitement
Was there excitement? Yes
Is the new system perfect? No
Will #NASCAR please everyone? No - Never

Don't have a solution but it was different
oops didn't finish my thought
Was there excitement? Yes
@RaceWeather there's some good but but there needs to be some tweaking..
One of my 13 year old twin sons just got home watched round 3 start, saw them sitting on pit road to quote... "This is weird"
@BobMargolis Needs some tweaking. At least @DISUpdates and @TalladegaSuperS just my opinion. You know what they say about opinions &lt;wink&gt;
@BobMargolis I don't disagree but when we watch them sit for 2 min it's like 2 min of black on TV...
@Pitbullmom88 what?
@joshfahey hey I got some paint drying to watch for 2 min.
I think @AllWaltrip just nailed... It doesn't make sense to do this group qualifying for just a spot to qualify for the actual race. #NASCAR
I think @RaceWeather is... Still waiting on my invite LOL RT @starlagirl08: @NASCAR_WXMAN are you setting up a yahoo fantasy this year????
Media people are weird anyway. I should know I am one. RT @nosaj75:  lots of @MRNRadio folks would disagree.
I get #NASCAR wants to have more excitement, more cars is better than 1 at a time but I don't think its playing out like they hoped.
Honesty this format @DISupdates for pole qualifying makes no sense. #NASCAR
@TreHolmes11 your the third different forecast some one has tweeted me in 24 hours
@IowaNascarFan patience... I will have it out later today/evening I have my main job to focus on first today
@raider_wayne cold front moves through mid week
@jerrysan52 I wish I had that power "Don't make the garbage, just drive the truck" actually rain is good for my business
I plan on doing a 7-Day forecast for the remainder of @DISupdates #Speedweeks2015 later this evening
@raider_wayne really early for an accurate 500 forecast I'll have a forecast out for the week later this evening
#NASAR Pole Qualifying - sunny &amp; nice. Warmer than I thought upper 60s. Winds NW 15-25 mph. That could be a slight issue
@bolg5 @NASCARNAC I do my own forecasts... It's too early for accuracy at this point. 2012 no forecast had rain until Wed B4 race
There are a lot of forecasts saying a lot of different things about next SUN. I'll put out a SUN forecast tomorrow
@NASCARNAC accuracy this far out is 30% or less
@NASCARNAC first of all depends on the source of your forecast... Back in 2012 when they ran on MON it was dry at this time
With 5 laps to go to how you liking the #SprintUnlimited and fearless predictions for the end #NASCAR
My wife just said she always knows when I mention her on Twitter cause her phone "blows up" so Happy Valentine's Day @mom2twinsplus1
Saw this on FB via @reilleysmom #NASCAR 
@TonyBarrios @NASCAR you're welcome
Loving the responses but there are some who don't need #50ShadesOfGrey only #NASCAR #ThisIsAFamilyShow
IN ONE WORD - Watching #NASCAR for the 1st time in 2015 makes me ______!
@MoylanKC no problem and stay warm I wish I was @DISupdates
@MoylanKC I don't know about Iowa but it's 50 here in Idaho
So how many across the east-coast, Midwest and plains have sympathy for @DISupdates &amp; 52 degrees? #NASCAR
#NASCAR Current conditions @disupdates 
That it’s still too early RT @MrFantasyNASCAR: What is the early forecast for the 500?
Detailed #NASCAR weather forecast for #SprintUnlimited tonight - Clear skies, cool not much wind. 
#NASCAR Weather looks great for tonight's #SprintUnlimited &amp; tomorrow's #D500 qualifying. &amp; What about next Sunday? 
@kevin_lott Yeah @RaceWeather is going to have another Fantasy League...
The excitement is building....RT @MISpeedway: 6 hours. <RECREATIONAL VEHICLE><DASH SYMBOL>

#SprintUnlimited 
#NASCAR Sprint Unlimited weather forecast - It's nice but how nice &amp; what about #D500? 
@ttiana with 50s and 60s we really don't calculate wind chill plus won't be that breezy tonight
#NASCAR weather for today, tonight &amp; SUN For @disupdates 
Turn Left
Turn Left
Turn Left
Turn Left
Big Crash
Maybe some rain...
We both do... RT @nascarcasm: @jeff_gluck @NASCAR Thank you sir - owe you massively!
@LauraSueHenshaw which part.
@nascarcasm so now that you're big time are you going to forget us little folk?
CONGRATS @nascarcasm for his new gig w/ @NASCAR 
@RaceWeather I kid because I care...
Looking great the next couple of days @DISupdates - No weather woes SAT/SUN Still WAY TOO EARLY for #D500 forecast 
@RaceWeather I bet those cars wish they get 15-20 mpg
@DouglasIvey1 @redneck_captain way too early. 2012 it was dry this far out and we know when we raced that race... Monday
@redneck_captain sorry about replying twice my phone is slow is getting me text responces from Twitter
.@redneck_captain here are my current thoughts on the 500 forecast 
@darrenmeeks88 here 
@Raceweather winds mpg miles per gallon lol
Nice weather this weekend @DISupdates but what about beyond to next weekend. I give some thoughts on the 500 forecast 
@redneck_captain did you read the article?
#NASCAR Sprint Unlimited weekend weather forecast: Rain? What Rain? Detailed forecast. 
@IndianaWxOnline not going to lie, I kind of wish we had more of a winter here in Idaho.
For those asking "Yes" too early for a detailed #D500 forecast BUT looking at next week. Wet weather poss. TUE-WED #NASCAR @DISUpdates
@TreyStafford24 Yes - there's a system for the end of the week maybe Wed or Thu...
@Nascar_MT When I said "cool" in the forecast - Northeast/Midwest people didn't like that.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @disupdates - lots of sunshine and clear 
I’m in the business of predicting the future &amp; with the ‘15 season upon us what’s your bold/crazy #NASCAR prediction this season.
@jerrysan52 my main job... It's sweeps and as chief meteorologist I can't take time off during the month
#NASCAR Weather forecast for @DISupdates this weekend is dry by cool for Florida standards. Keeping an eye on next week.
Really wishing I was @DISupdates #NASCAR
@tattoo_chick_11 @annoyingracefan Friday's high in Twin Falls 62 and 64 on Saturday
.@BlackHawks4343 because we are seeing a similar pattern to last year at this time. I'm thinking a wet start to 2015 #NASCAR
@annoyingracefan We are looking at record highs here in Idaho this weekend.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @disupdates &amp; #SprintUnlimited remains dry and fairly nice 
@tobrien82 definitely nice for the #SprintUnlimited Just a bit on the cool side for Daytona Race temps 50s/40s
@tobrien82 thanks for the follow and #BoilerUp Purdue grad 2001.
#NASCAR @disupdates weather forecast. It's still looking nice &amp; dry but chilly at times 
@pgawxman1 @CaptComeback @CarolinaWxGroup I'm in if you like
Rest of today &amp; leading up to this weekend the weather looks dry but chilly at times @DISupdates #NASCAR 
Carl Edwards motivated by move to Joe Gibbs Racing #NASCAR 
#SprintUnlimited temps in the 40s RT @gonzalezterence: "when you say chilly....how chilly are we talking?" #NASCAR
First glance for this SAT #NASCAR #SprintUnlimited @DISUpdate it looks dry &amp; chilly. Will watch a poss. cold front.
Watching #NASCAR Race Hub over on @NASCARONFOX... Maybe I will get a "First Look" at this weekend's @DISUpdate forecast later tonight

@nascarcasm I will say this, rain is good for this guy...
@Crwchfwyfy It's really good. My mom used to make me peanut butter and bacon sandwiches. It's a real thing.
@flahavin I love them that's why I make them and when it's "just the guys" the boys ask for it.
Here are the Peanut Butter and Bacon burgers I made for the boys #GuysNight #FatherSon 
@SpringWolf sent you a DM
@SpringWolf what's the link... I won't be able tonight after my show 7pm MT I have to go home make dinner.

That final play call by the #Seattle Seahawks was worst than calling for 2 to 3 feet of snow in NYC last week.
With that interception it's the #Seahawks Fans that are now deflated. #SB49 #SuperBowl.
Yeah I agree WHOA! RT @ryanvaughan: Coolest Super Bowl play ever? If they win?
WTH!!!! #Seahawks #SuperBowl
Let's hope so... RT @TerryBlountESPN: Does Russell Wilson had the late-game magic one more time?

Totally need to try and turn this Birthday around. I am hoping and planning on celebrating Saturday when I am off.

@jordan_bianchi thanks for the Birthday Wishes. And the other kind words. I lacked some patience this year than previous
@ryanvaughan I saw that, saw them hunch over didn't know what it was about.
Whatever life throws at you, remember you can handle it and somewhere someplace there really is someone who cares.
@JenDeach88 Off hand I don't know. I haven't looked. I'd really recommend checking the NWS or the local TV mets on a forecast.
@queers4gears hope you had a great birthday
Dear cough, you're getting old and not welcomed anymore. You make it hard to do m y job.

.@MattWeaverSBN Nice job all season. I will have #SnowBallDerby weather for @FiveFlagsSpeed in early Dec. #NASCAR
@LewisFranck Charlotte? I blame @wxbrad
@AllMilitaryNews Been watching classic Who starting with the 3rd's first episodes. Also going to re-watch season 8
During the off season I'll probably tweet about big weather events across the country or interesting weather.
@NASCARChaseTime I'll still tweet. I have to figure out what people might care about LOL
Thanks for following &amp; pay attention to my weather forecasts each week. Really appreciate it. Yes, it's too early for a @DISUpdates forecast
Congrats @KevinHarvick I've loved this season &amp; the new format. Many of you don't I understand that, but I do &amp; it's my opinion.
@JGLicious24 I can say "fixed" but I don't think it is. I do love all the conspiracies. If it was fixed 1-2- would Be Jr. Danica.
Who (if anyone) wrecks someone to win this thing? #NASCAR thoughts? Possible?
Could you script a better ending with 3 of the 4 championship contenders 1-2-3 in the closing laps? #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather conditions @homesteadmiami - getting cooler and sunset is just about 30 min away. 
@jerrysan52 @raceweather sometimes the user is a tool lol
Here's the start of the race weather conditions - sunset 5:32 PM ET @HomesteadMiami #NASCAR 
@jerrysan52 10-4 it's all good.
@jerrysan52 @RaceWeather Don't need to thank them. They're just tools providing data. It's how you interpret the data that makes a forecast.
@Follow_Trejo It's weather's balancing act... Bad to start the season nice to end.
I want to thank @raceweather for being a great teammate this season. A lot of forecasts we worked together on
I predict the weather. Wish I had "swag" to give away. I don't but what's your prediction for Champ &amp; @HomesteadMiami winner? #NASCAR
Been a pleasure providing weather for you this season. Will continue tweet during the off season not sure about what but will still tweet.
@jim_utter Happy Birthday man. Also a Nov. B-day min is in 9 days
Last weather forecast for the 2014 #NASCAR season @HomesteadMiami &amp; it's better than the first one - 
#NASCAR race day weather forecast @HomesteadMiami - Sun, clouds and no rain.

@MattHartgrave Stop talking to people of Facebook.
#NASCAR weekend weather forecast @HomesteadMiami No cold and I think we stay pretty dry. 
#NASCAR still think @homesteadmiami is mostly dry but now looks like a boundary will stall &amp; could spark iso. shower or two SAT/SUN. #NASCAR
My wife would say the same RT @wxbrad: My wife's reaction to #rokerthon , "wait don't you talk about the weather 24/7 already?" LOL
I've decided the nice weather to end the #NASCAR season is just balancing out how it started.
@basspro24chevy It's balancing out how the season started.
@JohnCostigan_IV It's 16 for me here in Idaho with snow on the way
#NASCAR weather forecast first glance @HomesteadMiami - Looking good. Sunshine &amp; highs near 80
@annoyingracefan I haven't looked yet I just got back to work after being sick with the flu since Friday of last week
@crownweather Erie PA still has record high low from Nov 12 the same year 1911.
We talk about this cold outbreak in November like it's never happened.= before. Look what happened 103 years ago 
@BellaMig nah I am like 4 days into it. So just trying to get my rest fluids and strength
Went to the doctors and it is indeed the flu. Just trying to get my strength back now.

Ugh, tired this day, this week has really drained &amp; zapped my energy. On top of that I think I am getting sick
@pianobar77 If I was selfish I'd want bad weather @HomesteadMiami because then I get more followers LOL
@pianobar77 I'm hoping we end the #NASCAR season nicer than how we started.
@jester_3 well unlike Phoenix from the spring race.
@laleon1 @HomesteadMiami Yeah too far off at this point. One race, one weekend at a time.

@RaceWx4You @Race4caster I work with @RaceWeather. &amp; Know @IndyCar_WXMAN. I Focusi mostly on the #NASCAR side of things

@RaceWx4You thanks for following and just discovered your account. Sorry it took me so long. Feel free to talk weather with me
Great article by @dustinlong on the fire &amp; passion that burns in @keselowski every fan should read it. 
I'm all for Pay-Per-View fights after #NASCAR races. Let the drivers take out their frustrations in the ring.
@awesomeracefans @jeff_gluck If you look at what happened at Charlotte no car was used as a weapon so "boys have at it"
Watching all that between @JeffGordonWeb &amp; @keselowski nothing much to say but the fans sure enjoy the emotion. #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather update - Sunset: 5:37 PM local time. Temps warmer than yesterday right now in the mid 60s @TXMotorSpeedway
@Bphillips2013 some lingering rain/snow as that system moves NE. Main concern 40-50 mph winds
#NASCAR temperatures already nearing 60 @TXMotorSpeedway it will be breezy 10-20 mph gust 25. Highs up 60s/nr 70
#NFL weather forecast, Week 9: A taste of winter in the northeast. 
@CornyDaCoupster @Jeff_Gluck got to love the app.
@Tjmajors Biggest concern later today will be the wind not the snow or rain. All of that moves out early afternoon
@brickyard2448 Hey I resemble that remark LOL @Jeff_Gluck
@jeff_gluck If you read my forecast from Saturday you would have been aware of the wind. Also it will be warmer this afternoon for the race.
Nothing like starting the #NASCAR race day and having @Jeff_Gluck go all Bill Belichick on meteorologists LOL
@jeff_gluck It's morning it's always cold in the morning. Some forecasts said windy today &amp; it's not afternoon... yet
#NASCAR Race day weather @TXMotorSpeedway - Should be nice but there's  ONE weather concern today. 
#NASCAR @TXMotorSpeedway weather forecast 2014 - No repeat from the Spring race. 
#NASCAR weather forecast for @TXMotorSpeedway 
@Indycar_Wxman @mom2twinsplus1 Here's our dog my son @Internalwhovian made the costume 
@Indycar_Wxman My sons are going as 10, 11 and 12 Wife @mom2twinsplus1 is going as River.
@UF_Gator_88 Yeah now that EVERYTHING is on it I am having some mobility issues LOL.
#Halloween costume is all but done. Proud I manage to put this together on my own #DoctorWho 
In case you missed it last night great weather (but cool today/Sat) @TXMotorSpeedway this weekend #NASCAR 
@AllMilitaryNews here it is 
@vegangymmie I'm only concerned about FRI/SAT/SUN LOL
@hnewhouseracing great good luck let me and us here @KMVTNews know
@SeattleSix I voiced an opinion not looking for an argument. You are very passionate so I understand. Don't have a response
@hnewhouseracing how are things going, any new news?
@SeattleSix Agree to disagree. I respect your views and understand where you're coming from.
@SeattleSix It's like saying why play 16 game in the NFL if only one game decides the champion. Or Baseball or most other sports.
@SeattleSix What's wrong with it I think it is exciting. I really like the new format.
@AllMilitaryNews I'm more or less "winging" it based on designs I found online. I'm making it out of fridge box.
#NASCAR weather forecast for @TXMotorSpeedway - Mother Nature seems to be a fan of the new chase format. 
@AllMilitaryNews I'm with you I'm waiting to see my finished Tardis
Great #WorldSeries in my opinion. Congrats Giants, but what a great story for KC. Doesn't seem like it right now to their fans. #MLB
Avery special career moment tonight. My Kidcaster tonight is deaf. I'm happy I got to giver her this opportunity 
@SarahT5110 #NASCAR Tweetcast for @TXMotorSpeedway - FRI &amp; SAT Sunny, cool 62-67 For SUN Partly sunny high nr 70
#NASCAR Tweetcast for @TXMotorSpeedway - FRI &amp; SAT Sunny, cool 62-67 For SUN Partly sunny high nr 70
Since @RoninLincoln asked #WorldSeries Game 7 weather looks nice &amp; clear light winds SE 0-5 mph temps low 50s.
@StevoTM that he does and football but not really into sports. Does want to play basketball this winter.
@AppFlyer  I was a huge baseball fan growing up. (Yankees) Wasn't until college I got into Football.
I've partially failed as a father tonight. My youngest son (11) didn't know what the World Series was? (thought it was a "football thing")
@riceman61 That was so awesome... Thanks for sharing.
#NASCAR @TXMotorSpeedway weather forecast. Continues to be dry &amp; partly sunny to sunny, could be breezy. Temps 66-72
@SarahT5110 @TXMotorSpeedway I haven't looked yet since Sunday I'll double check later tonight
#halloweencostume hoping to turn this refrigerator box into a Tardis #DoctorWho #NotHandy 
I love hearing the joy and excitement in the #NASCAR fans @MartinsvilleSwy Nice win for @DaleJr
@kp425 Had a few last week tell me they weren't going to watch since he was out... I bet you are right though
Wonder how many of Jr Nation decided to not watch the race today because @DaleJr was out of the playoff?
@TheOrangeCone @nascarcasm @Nascar_MT @angelfire_33 @TXMotorSpeedway I'm a hater.
@angelfire_33 lot can change but if the trend holds we could have another nice weekend.
@angelfire_33 I literally just tweeted it...
Normally I don't do forecasts that far out in advance but been bored with all this nice weather #NASCAR
@NascarPlus Thursday looks like a chance of storms as of now things COULD change in 7 days
It's way too early but IF the current weather trend holds we could be looking at another nice weekend @TXMotorSpeedway #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather for @martinsvilleSwy great looking forecast - sunny &amp; hi 73
#NASCAR Weather must be balancing itself out. Rain to start the season nice weather as we get ready to close it out 
Picture perfect weekend for #NASCAR @MartinsvilleSwy - Lots of sunshine and pleasant mild temperatures 
@raceweather accept for Charlotte
@Brad202b 3-5 days has an accuracy at or above 50% (generally) once you start getting past that it drops quickly (sorry for the delay)
@ntoutland we need to work on your definitions of "useless" and "Least important" LOL
#NASCAR weather forecast for @MartinsvilleSwy - I will be the least important person in NASCAR this weekend GREAT WEATHER sun &amp; 70s
@GinaV24 Watch is usually issued first and is the least severe - Advisory and of course warnings are upgrades from watches.
The truth is (like summer severe weather) Watch is the first step then in winter an Advisory or Warning are upgrades from a Watch
Talking Atlanta SnowJam at #NWAS14 interesting question for you. Which is more severe Winter Storm Watch or Winter Weather Advisory?
@jamescwhiteside @GDaveB Only insight I provide is in depth weather directed for the race track and race. WX = Weather in my name
ok changing course - what's your take and thoughts going into the next round? #NASCAR
@Tater01 i'd like to add video forecast to an app like that
all the replies are great... Lot of you would and there are many of you who wouldn't and I appreciate it. Thank you. Lot to think about
@Tater01 I think as a human forecast I do more than what an app can do. App would give me more options.
@jamescwhiteside @GDaveB plus the thing is it's only an idea. I don't have an app and some will buy most probably won't
@Tater01 and guess what, I don't have one yet and if I do have one you don't have to buy it
@jamescwhiteside @GDaveB I'd also like a way to interact and get photos from track and share.. But warnings where your location is my goal
@Tater01 it would be for your location while I won't update NFL/MLB I'd like warnings and radar for your location on phone
@MichaelGosch And it's ok not everyone will buy it and thats ok
@danceswithcat Thank you
@jamescwhiteside @GDaveB Fans those at the track maybe not the person who is always checking twitter from home
@Tater01 Its ok and I appreciate the answer
@jamescwhiteside great questions and that is the fact checking...
.@GDaveB small track/hometracks is a direction I am thinking one stop for warnings radar currents tweets and info in one place
@jamescwhiteside I still need to talk with a app provider/developer. Its only an idea
As of now, no I don't have an @MartinsvilleSwy weather forecast but by Wednesday I should have it out. Maybe earlier
@jamescwhiteside you schooled me you are right thanks
Again - this just a fact finding period. Nothing is going to change I am not changing just seeing what the future might hold (potential)
@nittanytrekkers sounds great but investing time away from family and job what is my return on this service?
to me all of you are great and I love interacting with you.. I want to help and look out for the fan who spends $$ to support #NASCAR
I do this cause I love #NASCAR and I want to help fans but it cost money to grow &amp; make an app. Thanks for the input.
One of the reason I am looking into an app is for those at short tracks on a Friday/Saturday... and where I can't be plus my updates in it
@DD1070 not many do what I do consistently and is dedicated every race to the fans as myself or @RaceWeather
@KnitThisTime i'd say I am better than those free weather apps
Also know nothing is changing I am just using you as gauging demand and maybe the future of what and how I do it.
@CBWFAN 10-4 If I priced it, it would be something anyone could afford.
I agree there is a lot of weather info out there but many of you follow me because I offer something different or something you can't get
I ask this cause as I grow and the demand grows for "specific" racing info I can't do it all. If I had an app wouldn't change what I do here
@CBWFAN Thanks I've thought about that maybe I should stop doing this since there are better dedicated racing info
@lianafielding sounds great but time is money and it gets to a point as I grow as well as demand
@totalsilliness then I am not needed ok thanks
non scientific poll - if I had a racing weather app would you pay a reasonable fee for it?
Thinking its time for next season to take my weather forecasts to app form
wow what a story &amp; development “@jayski_nascar: Eliminated from the Chase: Kahne, Kyle Busch, Johnson and Earnhardt, Jr.”
@MyLadysSword at a conference but no plugs where I am sitting
@scottyfromga my cable/internet company is not listed
@MyLadysSword power cord but no outlet
Seriously a debris caution this close to the end. Lots of excitement from @MRNradio #NASCAR
This is so exciting listening to @MRNRadio #NASCAR 
worst timing - laptop battery died while watching race now relying on twitter. #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather update it's 68 and sunny. Ok I've done my job today @TalladegaSuperS
@wxmc @elwxnino Trying to listen to #NWAS14 and pay attention to the #NASCAR racce
@wxmc @elwxnino We will see how that works for some of these guys. How many big ones could we see?
Rain what rain LOL RT @annoyingracefan: THE RAIN TWEET WAS A JOKE, YOU GUYS. DON'T YOU ALL FOLLOW @NASCAR_WXMAN ?
unless something is interesting to #NASCAR fans I won’t be tweeting about the weather conference on this account. follow @brianNeudorff
@cessna1967 I’m AT&amp;T I don’t think I can.
while I’m at #NWAS14 I will find time to listen (if anyone has a link to watch @TalladegaSuperS) the race while the conference is going on
@BHinIA “hate mail?” what did I miss?
At weather conference #NWAS14 today so very happy weather is nice for @TalladegaSuperS #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather forecast for @TalladegaSuperS no problems here! Great looking weather 
#NFL weather forecast, Week 7: Great looking weather 
#NASCAR Race day weather forecast for TalladegaSuperS 
#NASCAR @TalladegaSuperS weather forecast: Can't get much better than this. 
With spectacular weather expected this weekend @TalladegaSuperS I am going to take it easy this weekend.
@RyanLMcCollough 
@RyanLMcCollough I had that exact forecast out on Tuesday
Very excited about #NWAS14 in Salt Lake City. National Weather Association conference. Great time with colleagues
Weather forecast STILL looks great for @TalladegaSuperS #NASCAR 
@DaleJr If it's NOT a race day, what's your favorite kind of weather?
@RaceWeather welcome back my friend...
@dylan27w I wasn’t taking it serious I have a dry humor its all good
@dylan27w no I don't, I don't have HBO and I haven't watched it
@dylan27w not sure who that is sorry.
@dylan27w Well ok then l I am just sending this tweet over to Homeland Security
@CharNascar Lots of sarcasm in that comment of mine. I am actually thinking of making an app. @TheOrangeCone
@ShelbyDoucette you can and I wouldn't put it past @TheOrangeCone
@TheOrangeCone now if only I was as good as a weather app LOL
@TheOrangeCone by the way thank you for all your support now if I can catch up with you on followers.
@TheOrangeCone just win... just win
@TheOrangeCone I've had sports directors who know nothing about #NASCAR. This past spring I was interviewed to explain the chase brackets
@CayugaLake78 @jeff_gluck I always make my own forecast before each race.
@TheOrangeCone @keselowski Love it when news producers who know nothing about NASCAR do stories. I'm asked a lot of NASCAR questions at work
@Mike_Janzen @jeff_gluck I liked it...
@cnyautofreak I was at WROC in Rochester for 3 years &amp; Erie PA for 5 I know Lake Effect. Those bands are just hard to pinpoint
@cnyautofreak I think you have that stat backwards i’d say most are 85% correct. Like you to prove your claim
I'm Meteorologist Brian Neudorff &amp; I approve this forecast - No apps were used in the making of this forecast. 
@2448fan4life @TalladegaSuperS I think it is solid I really do I wouldn't put it out this early if I didn't
#NASCAR this is early for me but feel confident about @TalladegaSuperS weather forecast -

@brad202b through my other account @BrianNeudorff I posted Twin Falls weather I have 78
@Brad202b Where in Idaho do you live?
@jaywpennell I don't think Tony's role in this is a big deal...
@AlanRHooper No I don't read it that way.
@Mrs_Hart2 thanks but with the number of followers I have I thought maybe word of mouth would be better than Trip Advisor
@StephenMcC87 or put everything in backpack in a plastic bag then inside backpack.
Looking for a good restaurant in #SLC for next weekend. Feel free to give me your recommendations.
Hope everyone is having a great Sunday?
NFL weather forecast, Week 6: Strong storms possible in Tennessee 
@wayjulez what if I a meteorologist has to use the camera to do my own stories am I a photometeorjournalistman LOL
@lisabroomall if I can help let me know sorry for some reactions. It's ok. Weathermen are not wrong until we are wrong LOL thank you
@wayjulez Actually most of my colleagues at work prefer photojournalist.
@lisabroomall I am sorry for that and those that I did see I did try to tell them that too was uncalled for.
Ok time for the family and I to watch Doctor Who...
@AllHorsepower he was thinking I better win an emmy  @jim_utter
Props to the cameraman RT @jim_utter: Kudos to the steady cameraman hands
of all the places to be fighting between two haulers is not the place to be...
That's a wrap. Will have my weather forecast for @TalladegaSuperS around Tue or Wed. On Race day I will be at a weather conference
@3Allenrw @StewartHaasRcng @CLTMotorSpdwy No...
Appears all showers are weakening and diminishing. Rain appears to no longer be a threat. #NASCAR #BOA500 @CLTMotorSpdwy
#NASCAR Radar update - improvement still monitoring cell SW of @CLTMotorSpdwy #BOA500 
#NASCAR I say it's not the rain you see but the rain you don't on radar you have to worry about. Tracking some rain 

Read more here: 
@AppFlyer I tweeted her just a few min ago asking how wrong I was and how that 80% weather channel app was doing
yes it does  RT @JRs_Creations: @NASCAR_WXMAN @CLTMotorSpdwy  Looks good Here ! 
@lisabroomall You said I was wrong and called "shenanigans" hows that 80% TWC app doing right now?
#NASCAR the radar looks clear around @CLTMotorSpdwy - No longer worried about anymore rain for the #BOA500
@KirkWilson12 No I think we are good from here on out.
#NASCAR radar update - light shower WNW of @CLTMotorSpdwy monitoring it. It's weakening but will update if need be 
Here’s how I’m watching the #BOA500 race  #NASCAR 
you can't script this RT @BenWrightTKO: I get the frustration, but the hoops game going to OT is comedy gold.
so #NASCAR fans have a TV choice of Baylor/TCU on ABC or exhibition NBA on ESPN News - I'm going with @PRNLive
recommend grabbing your radio, computer or smart phone and stream @PRNLive - The app is free. #nascar @CLTMotorSpdwy 

Engines are fired up at @CLTMotorSpdwy! #lowes48
Think the showers to the northwest of @CLTMotorSpdwy will miss but I think #NASCAR fans are more concerned with TCU/Baylor OT
@DRiccioni I don't see any rain at the track
Sorry that I didn't predict the Baylor/TCU as a possible delay to #NASCAR.
Keeping an eye on the showers to the NW of @CLTMotorSpdwy I don't think they are a threat but will continue to monitor #NASCAR
After a heart breaking end to the #Purdue #MSU game I need an exciting #NASCAR race.
@Smac715 freaking rip my heart out ugh
#NASCAR Radar update - Watching isolated cells forming WNW of @CLTMotorSpdwy looks like they miss the track 
@Smac715 Been watching it's closer than yo would like.
@iRainOnRaceDay Happy Birthday
I'm quiet because the weather is quiet but watching radar. Keeping an eye for anymore development #NASCAR
#NASCAR weather update for tonight's #BOA500 CharlotteMotorSpdwy 
@NASCARJayson @glennjhull @AirTitan2Dryer @CLTMotorSpdwy rain moving away &amp; nothing moving towards
@NASCARJayson @glennjhull @AirTitan2Dryer @CLTMotorSpdwy the track or the radar?
@jim_utter @StephenMcC87 I think we can, we are still over an hour from the race. We have some sun &amp; air titan
@wxrjm good news... Moving away
@Mmm_Ryoko we don't need to get nasty @lisabroomall but thank you for your support.
@dalejr88in2011 no need for that name calling @lisabroomall thanks for your support.
comes down to track drying and I think there is plenty of time to get it done RT @rowdybusch1818:  you think this starts on time
#NASCAR No rain to worry about right now. Small threat of a pop-up shower but likelihood is low. We Got This 
@Jordan_Bianchi new forecast update for 
#NASCAR weather forecast update for the #BOA500 @CLTMotorSpdwy 
@themike79 I wish I could then I could do this full time and be at every race.
@Nastycar4 there really isn't one but if I had to use one I like the Baron''s Saf-T-Net
#NASCAR Video Weather Update for #BOA500 @CLTMotorSpdwy 
Comes down to the Air Titan RT @AFD81: what's the chance @CLTMotorSpdwy race will start on time IYO?
As Indiana Native LOVE RT @StewartHaasRcng: There's a window over Terre Haute, so we should be able to get tonight's race in, no problem.
Did someone say the rain would be done by 5:30 pm EDT @CLTMotorSpdwy yeah... THIS GUY!
@wxrjm ok hard to tell thanks
Answer to Questions:
Delay? Possible-
Complete Race? Very likely odds 80-90%
#NASCAR @CLTMotorSpdwy
@wxrjm that was an old image boo.
thats me RT @Riceman61: Not what the big screen was designed for, hopefully moves out @CLTMotorSpdwy @PRNlive
