$SPY Algos are happy about the strong #NFP jobs report. FX traders see something far less optimistic as dollar gains are muted.
@traderstewie 80% of professional managers don't beat indices, so I take every tip at face value of 20% to give me an edge.
Many previous leaders now looking weak: tech $QQQ healthcare $CURE Europe $EURL Japan $NKY. Market being carried by  few names $DIS $UVE etc
Long term treasuries $TLT $TMF near the 200 MA, but also need to invalidate the lower high. 
Some sectors looking pretty well toppy - $ITA defense and aerospace has now broken down and in its Kumo cloud.
Not about to call in a top quite yet for this $EURUSD move, but I can't imagine that it would go above 1.13-15 with QE going on there
Shooting star for $INDU at previous resistance, bearish engulfing after a doji for $SPY. Looks like $AAPL will carry the old bull
@PugTrader Same thought but for $BZQ with Brazils economy and Petrobras in bad shape. Good shorting opportunity
Productive sprint this month. 38 economic reports get cleaned and constrained to the DB. 8 hours of work reduced to 5 min each week
Hawaiian $HA earnings - beats forecast nice 11% pop. Earnings &amp; higher lows validates uptrend re-emergence 
Oil $USO hitting resistance at the same level the rally failed in Feb. Want a breakout or hourly bottom 
Bounce today after Friday's sell-off. Yet reasons behind the sell-off (#Greece, poor earnings) still remain. $EWG oversold
How can people get so panicky when we have hit this same resistance level two times? Set take profit levels at obvious points...
@lilmizzbunnie I'd chalk it up to a coincidence of more Greek #grexit drama, rather than the chart being the primary driver behind today
Right on cue, most indices form a doji right at the previous double top resistance levels of late Feb and late Mar. $SPY $INDU.
Good day to be piled into energy $HES $SSL $COSWF. I would like to see once more higher dip to add holdings.
China large caps $FXI  went parabolic. 
#REITS sinking. $IYR broke support and made a lower high.
Everyone loved that awful NFP. So now maybe we have a hike in September, or maybe never. Good chance for dollar index to settle $UUP
Finished Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Really wish I read this before the other 20 investment books out there as this is the "O.G."!
If someone has a good expert adviser for MQ/MT4 that deals with economic release straddles PM me.
$SPY and $INDU hammers at previous support levels was constructive. Still at a dip in an uptrend. 
Risk-on formations in the hourly charts for the Yen, REITs $IYR. 50 day $SPY EMA held.
$SPY and $QQQ effectively double topped; both rest previous @ #FOMC support.  Hourly below the Kumo w daily uptrend still intact.
Can't recall the last time I saw #FOMC upward movement so quickly reversed back to the downside. $QQQ $SPY
#FOMC created a bullish reversal candle for oil $USO but I want to see a close above 50 EMA for downtrend invalidation
I love the smell of #riskoff in the morning. Its a musical chairs game of QE and moving the goal posts for ZIRP. Should be a nice leg up
REITs $IYR breaking out of the downtrend which started on 1/26 ahead of #FOMC minutes
$SPY starting to tightly range; looking @ #FOMC "patience" clause to push price out of range one way or other with pair trades
Retail sales tomorrow. Long VIX may keep growing in value. Otherwise putting in tight dollar cross buy stops and conservative limit buys
$SPY $TMF watch patiently, act quickly. $BIB holding up nicely.
Today - a happy day to have a Forex account or $UUP. A painful day if one does not know what Forex is.
#REITS $IYR finding support but still have not broke out of the downtrend. 
$USO unable to invalidate the 50 DMA again.
Hitting take profit levels on a few trades. Raising stops on others. week 4 of the rally, I'll give it 2 more wks for my trailing stops $SPY
$EURUSD got Euro trashed today. Nice to wake up seeing that all your sell stops had take profit levels hit even before noon.
Only risk for $SPY the week ahead is oil $USO since the market has determined to ignore #Ukraineconflict and #ISIS.
$SPY continues up on broad #Risk-on thanks to no #Grexit. Last time market breadth was this strong was 11/14. Long GREK TQQQ BIB DRN
$GREK pricing in a resolution to the #Grexit #ECB drama.
REITS looking like they may break down after all. Next support is 77, right at previous level and 61% Fib, $IYR
Crude $USO on the way back down. Now lets see where the arduous process of finding the bottom ends up retesting support.
Utilities $FXU finding support with high on balance volume
$USDJPY recovering after the #ECB #Grexit fears. Positive on balance volume gaining with long wicks on candles 118.250-118.400 range
Eurogroup meeting put on hold after Greece says draft “unacceptable”: 
REITS $DRN $IYR hammering out a bottom at the 50 EMA. People with cheap QE Euros hungry to carry trade for yield.
$SPY finally closes above its channel, however #Grexit #ECB decision will either propel or invalidate leg up.
$SPY up on Ukraine ceasefire, because Putin always has historically shown that he "honors" ceasefires.
@wellsmontague with today's earlier down move we are closing with a hammer. could be the reversal need more vol. data
I'm not one for classic patterns but oil $USO just fit the bill of a saucer bottom and is now closing above the Kijun line.
Weekly Economic Dashboard: 32 US, EUR, JPY, CNY reports aggregated for fundamental analysis. 
$TQQQ and $UPRO firming up on support right as oil is picking back up. Data is not great, but cheap Euros are coming for carry trades $UPV
@harmongreg If you are a CMT, then you like data; see what these statisticians have to say about a 2007 rule change: 
Lots of bullish hammers with long wicks appearing today at support levels $TQQQ $CURE; offset by falling stars on inverse energy $ERY
#FOMC statement was clearly not bullish. Now in the dip and waiting to see where we find support.  $DRN $YINN $UBT $BZQ $ERY $TQQQ
$SPY forming a rising wedge and out of the Kumo but needs to clear 209 resistance. Bonds and $GLD looking like #riskoff
Ready for the #ECB rodeo tomorrow with $UPRO $VXX pair trade on a gap up/down $UPV with a stop loss. $UBT as a hedge
$SPY finding support last Friday after reuters data. But, $VXX $GLD $UST stubbornly elevated.
$BIB biotechs hit a daily triple top followed by a bearish engulfing candle, VIX closing above the 200 MA, SPY clings to support #riskoff
$RUSS $DRN $ERY and $VXX staying strong
$XLP hammer not confirmed with a high volume close downward.
$USDJPY also finding support and forming a hammer on the hourlies.
$XLP and $CURE forming bullish hammers and pin bars at the close. Looks like selling exhaustion.
Quite a few sectors $FAS $KIE more are almost breaking through the mid Dec low levels. Waiting for FOMC &amp; NFP to give us the leg up or down
$RUSS consolidating in uptrend right at the 50 day VWMA. Ready to break out of the 30 min Kumo.
New post on the initial approach to create an economic database for 40 reports of the four largest economies: 
$USO Yoda say bouncing around in a channel does not a bottom make. Beware the prognosticators...be aware of your signalling.
Aaaand we're back! #FOMC fed re-starts the rally with a high volume bullish engulfing candle. $SPY $UPRO $CURE $SOXL $QQQ
USDCAD $USO and $RUSS all looking like oil sell off got over extended and crude is firming up. Not calling a bottom but rather resistance
$RETL still showing strength. Less money on gas = more money on shopping. Too easy.
$SPY Market breadth sharply down for the week. Not seeing any indication this pullback is over yet. Locked in gains on $RUSS $EDZ $UBT $ERY
Oil cos already cutting dividends - now can the Saudi's keep #OPEC in line until fracker small caps run out of cash due to &lt;$60 Oil? $USO
$RUSS $UBT and $TMF doing well in risk-off. $UL $FXU tell me that utils/telecos, dividend payers and health will remain leaders.
Now Fed roils markets even by choosing what language not to use. On 30M charts $SPY looks to close below its 200 1st time since Oct
$SPY Last week there was a bearish RSI divergence with a higher price but a lower RSI, seems it is playing out after a few dojis.
$RUSS up 16% today. Still, would wait for a limit order fill rather than buy on the breakout.
$RUSS short Russia ETFs forming a clear uptrend on oil weakness, and dollar strength. Nice non-correlated play to domestic stocks.
6 market breadth indicators with uptrend intact for 3 weeks. Do we buy on a sustained breakout or prepare for mean reversion?
$EURUSD don't hold your breadth for easing - Draghi's track record is jawboning. ECB doesn't need to ease with US hiking rates. $UUP up!
$SPY still pops on bad ECB news.  Price touching 2 std dev bollinger band, RSI and stochastic still overbought. Its a freight train.
$SPY may finally close below the Kumo support on the 30 minute chart for the first time since 10/18.
$EURUSD coming up near a twice tested resistance point at 1.25600. Watching to see how the 30M chart reacts to that level based on data
$GLL forming a pretty clear dip buy in uptrend. Dollar strength &amp; GDP confirm fundamentals. Decent risk reward.
$USDCNY looking like the bottom is behind us after the PBOC rate cuts. Closing in on a Kumo breakout if the Chikou span confirms.
$SPY breaks resistance marking 5 rallying weeks. Daily and hourly RSI both above 70. Hit most take profit levels, cash is ok for me here.
Important note that Draghi once again did not say stimulus was occurring, merely that he would act if needed. More jawboning than anything.
$SPY still going strong; impressive move back up. Guess we just grind up until Christmas?
$SPY 30 min chart on balance volume moves below its 200 period moving average for the first time since crossing it on 10/21. #FOMC
$IJR small caps starting to break down on the 60 min charts, now going past the Kumo and 200 EMA.
$SPY finding resistance and forming a Doji. 4 market breadth indicators are bullish, and have been for 3 weeks. Watch for profit taking.
$DPK $EPV Developed world Bears are getting hungry and starting to move off lows as this rally loses steam.
$SPY with a possible bearish on balance volume divergence. The OBV high did not make the higher high that the price action did.
$NKY $JPNL $USDJPY pop after BOJ announces more easing - Central banks are now just tag teaming easing and stimulus.
Strong on balance volume shows $FB to be stronger than the price action. The gap down ended in a high volume bullish hammer.
Giving users full SharePoint admin rights without training is like giving out a handgun without a firearm safety course.
$SPY $QQQ no denying there is a reversal of the downtrend, but current rally is at about a 55-60 degree slope. Not sustainable.
$UBT: the gift that keeps on giving.
@scheplick @JBoorman the top 3 items don't have a correlation with causing hysteria...was Y2K real or were its effects real?
@TheOnion The best part of Onion articles is the commenters who don't know they are satire or are so humorless they don't get satire
VIX spikes to new highs, Advance/decliners and net new highs both bearish. Wait for $SPY to find support where a higher low forms.
Muni bonds $TFI still continue to march higher on an uptrend. Buying on the dips.
#Fed #FOMC minutes create a bullish engulfing candle for the $SPY and on higher volume.
Looked like a reversal last Friday, but leaders are staples $XLP, the dollar $UUP, long treasuries $TLT and health $FXH something is off...
Long pinned hammer reversal candles  $SPY $DDM at the 50 day EMA- right along with $UUP having a bearish shooting star.
Looks like a $USDJPY bearing engulfing reversal candle
@jfahmy worth noting there's a fundamental driver missing from the recipe that was baked in the last two years of numbers
The Kumo cloud of the $VXX has now flattened for the first time in a long time.
Market sharply down: advancers decliners below the 26 day average, lower lows on the high/low index, only 40% NYSE above moving avg
Short Russell 2000 $TZA has a Kumo breakout with the Chikou confirming. Need to close above 17.50 for the breakout from last high
Glad I loaded up on $UBT long term treasuries yesterday. Bloodbath everywhere else.
South Korea $EWY is consolidating right along the 200 day EMA for over a week. Look for the breakdown or breakout.
@alphatrends I can't view; Page not found 404 error
Went to a investing conference yesterday; learned one thing. ETFs are products. Products are meant to be sold, not to guarantee success.
20+ treasuries $TLT with a large high volume bullish candle following a doji right along the trendline support
Strong: $SOXL just does not quit. Even in the last dip it didn't stop surging. Weak:Pacific Rim $VNM $YINN $EWA
$UPV with a higher low and trending higher on Euro easing. Look for $JPNL to rise on BOJ easing too. #currencywars
Seems the Market is patiently waiting for Yellen to keep ZIRP and taking profits in case she doesn't. $SPY #FOMC
Look for the #FOMC speech and the #scottishindependence vote for $ GBPUSD direction after 9/19
Quite a dramatic drop in real estate $IYR which goes past profit taking. This was one of the more stable safe bets of the year.
$AAPL looking bullish with support at the  50 Day MA after the shakeout yesterday. Possible short squeeze.
Dollar still overbought on most pairs HKD and Baht are laggards. $ USDTHB with a Kumo breakout.
Ratio of bulls to bears on AAII is 2.73:1; 67% NYSE is above moving averages and $SPY back above 2K on strong PMI. That dip got erased quick
In a down day $NFLX $VNM $TIP $UBT still providing a nice defense. Long term treasuries still behaving nicely in this environment
Vietnam $VNM joining in with the rest of the Pacific Rim, like Austrailia $EWA on strong weekly gains. People betting on growth and risk on.
Many asset classes starting to all closely correlate; $XLF $ITB $KIE (insurance, housing, homebuilders) joining the party late
Bullish 9 and 26 day moving average crosses for $XRT (with Kumo breakout) $XLV and $IYY,
Bullish price channel crosses above moving averages this week for $QQQ, $EWA, $EEM, $EWZ, $XLV, $INDY. Nice gainers: $BRZU, $NFLX
Bullish 9 day 26 day price channel crosses this week for $GDX $SHY $AGG.
$QQQ $TLT $UST, $UUP and $YINN all looking strong. $SPY still has legs. Dow and Russell looking tired.
Shit got real. Weekly scrum work allows batch signal processing for 156 global ETFs. #finance #productivity #algoritmictrading
$SPY finding support in lower Kumo cloud. Friday rally almost formed a bullish engulfing candle but on low vol. #Ukraine_vs_ISIS
Theres a meme going around that buying this dip will fail. Not true. It is dependent upon your systems entry criteria.
Market breadth turned sharply lower and 1st time in months $SPY is in the Kumo support area. Formed a doji on Friday showing indecision.
Let's watch the NFP possibly cause some havoc $UUP $EURUSD. Dip buying $UUP in the future.
$TLT hammer candlestick with the wick touching the 26 day price channel.
Got stopped out of quite a few things. Down about .2% for the day. Ill gladly take it amidst the bloodletting.
Strong numbers may finally force the Feds hand and get us into a correction where there are deals to be found. Way overdue.
Week: S&amp;P, Nasdaq, and Dow still strong. Small caps wavering. VIX and long term treasuries surging showing some indecision.
$HA and $UCO working out nicely since last week. $TAN the biggest loser.
Finding resilience today in $TLT, $DANG, $TSLA, $UCO, $TIP, $ELD, $XLU. Not all uptrends will march with other uptrends.
Taking a shot at $TSLA with 2 50 EMA touches and it also sitting right on the 61.8% Fib line.
$TAN kumo breakout with chikou confirmation. Aligns with weekly trend. 200 ema shows prev support too
Crude and airlines both down in the same day and treading support. One has gotta give &gt; Pair trade, tight stops $UCO $HA
$TSLA looking strong with a Kumo breakout but expensive like everything else. Patiently waiting for the equities beat down to get it cheaper
$HA $DAL still getting no love due to Iraqi driven upward $USO pressure. If/when it resolves nice dip buys for airlines
$HA finding support right at Fib lines, the Kumo and 30m chart turning bullish. Limit placed with a nice risk/reward ratio
$GLD busts out past the Kijun resistance after hanging there. Lets see now if it can break the Kumo at 128.
Prices gravitating to Kijun-sen 26 period line and right now $GLD is capped there. Watching for the 30M chart to break down for shorts.
$DIS showing a small pin bar right on the 26 day Kijun line; limit order placed. Lots of econ news this week to move markets.
@uncivilpodcast hey maybe you want to put a direct link to your podcasts on Twitter?  Im not sharp enough to get the direct link
Its irrelevant what will or wont happen in Iraq. All thats relevant is your system has signaling in place to catch the move or cut the risk
$VXX firming up and $FXY yen index getting bullish on the 30M charts. May be a chance for dip equity buying if the move continues.
This week should be telling as we have $QQQ and quite a few ETFs hitting the previous resistance/high. $CURE
limit order placed for $GLL on the kumo breakout with trigger order for $UGL in case of whipsaw
Risk-on S&amp;P and even more risk on $JPNL rally today, alongside my 20+ year ultra treasuries $UBT. Odd to be moving together.
After a decent par yesterday I realized trading is a lot like golf: you beat yourself and proper execution trumps strategy.
Weekly sprint complete. Integrated checklists into trading workflows. Automates position entry logic and sizing. #scrum #finance
Crude is up about 8% the last two weeks. And just a few days ago IEA cuts the California shale output by 90%. Awfully coincidental timing
Biggest gem of forex ive learned. don't place the stop where it should be. Place a limit order there for when brokers take out stops.
$USDJPY formed a nice long reversal candlestick - but the wick is at a lower low. Inclined to bounce sell till the dailies get higher lows
The problem with getting trade picks from any source (including me) is that with each passing moment you have missed the move
small caps forming a nice easily identifiable downward channel for bounce selling - or dip buying if you feel lucky. $IJR
@uncivilpodcast very clever name. nicely played!
$BIS inverse biotechs very near a valid (Chikou confirmed) Kumo breakout. $QQQ moving below the cloud.
@jasand @justin_frank nothing to really understand
Utilities finally seeing weakness after hitting a double top and nearing the Kijun Sen. $UPW. Look for the hourly to set trend
Crude looking ready to ramp up. Clear support above the Kumo and now the hourly turning bullish $UCO $USO
HFT causing some havoc today, just saw $EWU bounce up and down 5%. I usually only see this kind of madness with Forex
Interesting that utilities took the biggest smackdown of today, while $EEM and especially Brazil blew up. Getting back into $UPW on revert
Pleasantly happy with current mix of $UBT $UPW $UPRO $ JPNL and dividend moaters like $PG and $WEC. up days and down days are about the same
@jasand that looks pretty sweet man! Youre always one step ahead.
Twitter feed overload now. So its time for a .net solution to aggregate the data and separate signals from noise.
Its Tuesday, everyone knows what that means right? Buy Buy buy! Magical Clockwork.
Weekly recap: seeing several indexes with lower highs, may be starting to see a downward sloping channel. $ITA $SPY
The market finally decided to price in Ukraine. Better late than never,  right?  $WEC $UPW $UBT
@upsidetrader finely played good sir!
@InvestSarasota @zerohedge Hopefully you bought that dip right about now and not earlier. Why the world listens to Lavrov I do not know.
@zerohedge And somehow $RUSS is down 3%. WTF.
6 armored personnel carriers overrun by russians but the market has disconnected from reality. $SPY regaining support anyhow.
$RUSS is looking like a good hedge to place. Looking for a pop on monday after Ukrainian unrest.
So another "correction" over after fed minutes are read? Looks like risk is back on. I really don't know why I use stops anymore.
$USDJPY still falling but $EURUSD isn't behaving like a crisis quite yet.
Pre-taper: bad news saw market buying. Post-taper: good news is market selling. $SPY $UPW $RUSL $TMF.
Nasdaq and everything except utils got crushed. Good day to have used a pair trade with varied ATR trailing stops $UPRO $ SPXU
$SPY correction is over pending Friday jobs report: price crosses the 26 day price channel.
Weekly recap equities in a dip but hour charts flirting with weak bullish signals. Four $SPY hammer bars near the 38.2% Fibonacci line
BAM first sprint working for a simple automated trading system! Asset lifecycle controlled from ideation to P/L with no manual effort.

Glad I rode the bullish Ichimoku break for $GLD $TLT $TIP. Putins fueling my vacation.
Yet more bad news after Japan's GDP contracts. Central Banks are in check; and mate is only avoided by more easing. $GLD $SHV watching $VIX
Why would the markets be trending back up after weak jobs and retail data? 4 words: dovish Yellen delayed taper. $UPRO $QLD $UVE $MPO

@jasand not a hater. Hes a great player who is also a concussion away from his career ending
@jasand you don't want him. Injury prone
$USDJPY way overbought at with RSI &gt; 70for 3 hours. Riding it down and then back up like a bronco.
Breakouts are for suckers, but this time, that edge looks to have worked $SPY $UPRO
$SPY at all time highs, $VIX at all time lows. the $SPY has to revert to its mean at some point, as all averages do.
Uh oh, bearish engulfing candle in overbought territory shows the $ SPY may have a correction. Thanks #Fed
A well placed buy stop order for $AUDUSD 5 minutes before CPI netted long investors about 500 pips in 5 minutes. #straddle #forex

$SPY correcting. Target Fibbonacci retractments: 163, 158, 155, 151 with a the years gains erased at the 100% to 140
@gerard_wilde hey maybe that was the same group of intellectuals yelling at our wedding party
@jasand pretty much expect a short term move down, with a buying opportunity when prices find support, classic "dip buying"
$ SPY $ QQQ last week a bearish harami pattern formed. This week it was confirmed with an island top pattern. Look for a short dip.
markets are all calm before the storm. This low volatility moment is when the Algos place stop buy and sell stops for gains.
$AUDUSD fails yet again to break above .93. Double top spotted on 15M charts.
Bernanke completes correction up. $SPY above last resistance high. Pivot points should now be test levels.
US Oil (WTI) – Noted $103.60 resistance broken…Inverted H&amp;S objective within reach: 
$SPY looking like correction may have been short lived. Nearing bullish Kumo breakout and forming a hammer pattern. $QQQ close to prev high
$EURUSD $UUP Non-farm payrolls continue to put pressure on Euro. Look for 1.28 test for signs of bearish momentum.
Micro-management gives control. Collaboration gives creativity. But you can't use both and expect them to work together.
Still happy with last weeks buys of $UUP and $ SPXU. $ HDGE flattening previous losses.
They’re selling everything: 
@jasand im just playing.  I'm sure they are a fine organization
