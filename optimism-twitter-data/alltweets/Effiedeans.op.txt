It's time for everyone who loves UK to tell Cameron to simply say to Nicola you already had your referendum. You lost. Game over. Goodbye
.@eatsleeplaugh Progressive today means things that I like. It has no further meaning. Best dropped from adult discourse
Back home again in Scotland very soon &amp; it seems to me I see some rather distressed Nats who have failed. Lost again

<GRINNING FACE>
SNP have destroyed the Left in the UK, yet call this being progressive. SNP is completely toxic. Look where Nationalism leads
.@thatsmabhoy It is moving. I have laid flowers at such memorials myself. I've done it in UK too. I'm remembering the same sacrifice
.@GetItBenYe Just like the all the others you are being deliberately offensive. I'm not a hermaphrodite. Goodbye
.@hectormcglumphe Do you seriously think Cons are like the BNP or the Front national? That shows remarkably poor understanding I'm afraid
.@DTunstall55 Neither Ed or Eck will be writing any budgets. Eck is more impotent than Balls who can at least influence his wife
.@DanLeePadgett I haven't noticed you up to now. But happy to oblige. Though it seems a bit childish and pointless. Bye
.@hectormcglumphe Cons are not far right. But we have a Con govt because of the SNP threatening to hold England's feet to the fire #SNPout
.@CoronaAurorae И Вам спасибо за внимание. Я очень рада, что моя статья пришалсь Вам по вкусу. С #ДнемПобеды!
Standing up to bullies &amp; abusers is crucial. Well done J. K. Rowling 
I'm always going to remember today &amp; yesterday 8th &amp; 9th May as Victory day 
.@detectordennis Really? Our task was to keep SNP from influencing UK government. We succeeded. It matters not at all how many SNP MPs now
.@YESthatcherDead Perhaps you should change your name to Yes David Lloyd George is dead. Wicked Lib Dems worse than Tories. Lackeys too
.@Planet_Pedro If we try to bring some unity back to the UK &amp; equal devolution, there can be PMs from anywhere
.@57FK66 Cameron doesn't need to make an off he has an absolute majority. No-one can predict the future. I can't. You can't either
Difference between a hung parliament &amp; an absolute majority was SNP threats of what they would do in the event of one. Vote Nats get Tories
Nats are going Nuts as I point out truth that I'm happier than they are. It's easy to block SNP now 
@SuicideBiscuits Who said it was. I didn't
.@mahkusjaybee Agreed tactical voting didn't work. But our side is massively more happy today than yours is
.@PatonGordon I voted for the LDs and have done so for years.
.@Bill_Cameron You may be right. Rather shocking that half of Scotland voted for far left. Far left is just as bad as far right in my view
.@GoldBug2000 I think I read that one when it came out. This was something we were not allowed to mention some time ago
Effie, interesting article, thanks.
Did you see this?

.@WingsScotland Why not read today's blog Stuart. But really by frightening the horses in England SNP caused the Tory government #SNPout
.@Davidindie123  More disgusting insults based on mental illness. You just make yourself look bad. It doesn't touch me
.@KateVasey Calling people rude names is not exactly ethical. Anyway what has it to do with you you're in Portsmouth. Bye
.@Flooplepoop Tactical voting didn't work but we're a lot happier today than you lot. You are not in Government you are out #SNPout
@Historywoman  Michael Gove is from Aberdeen. Not sure if he will be in the Cabinet. But your point is well made
.@klockedthis  Don't worry you will be hearing lots from me. I'm found yesterday amusing, but today if anything is even more so
.@fleshofmyflesh  Wouldn't it be even better if you refused to take up you seats. Then you'd have even less influence
.@RobertThe_Fox I voted for Christine Jardine the Lib Dem candidate in Gordon. Have voted that way for years
.@FaeTroon We plan to really shake them up when we hold Nicola's feet to the fire. We're going to ask her to put Scotland together again
.@taighsolais Why not try to debate rather than repeat cliches. Just another Nat sitting by himself laughing to himself he he he
@FalconerBrian My apologies then. I thought you were.
.@CrowtherJohn Thank You John. Of course you disagree. But you are becoming a very worthy opponent who I respect
@malcolmcameron7 Malcolm you are an absolute star. That's my favourite tweet all day

@Ef…
.@robertfrater111 "hun" is considered a sectarian term of abuse. But I've been called much worse than that
.@UK_4ever This only makes indyref2 more likely if Cameron is foolish enough to allow one. Why should he? They had their referndum
.@FalconerBrian You don't know me, you don't know what I do. Just another Nat who likes to taunt
.@traquir We won traquir. Whole campaign was to keep you out of govt. We succeeded. The SNP are indeed out. They influence no-one #SNPout
@KHunter17 Isn't it all connected with him in the end. But who controls him. That I would like to know; Right to the top I suspect
@KHunter17 Thanks .It's blocked and actually completely irrelevent
.@GetItBenYe Sparta is rather older than Scotland, so is Rome, So is Wessex, So is Dál Riata. I can go on like this all day. So what?
This one is from the heart 
#ДеньПобеды #Victory day
.@AlexWJnr If you offered me a USA type solution. Lots of local power with strong central government I would take it in a second.
.@Herdy79  I find that frequently they miss the point I am making. Makes it rather difficult to debate
.@malcolmcameron7 I really hope they are not offered FFA. The SNP would take it in a second. They know it gives them independence.
.@ruskadoronin Whole campaign in UK was dominated by SNP. It prevented Labour campaigning. 1st point I can't prove, but think it is true
.@MHTQPR Most important issue we must campaign on now is Full Fiscal Autonomy. If Cameron gives FFA it's over. It wouldn't last 5-10 years
.@elmerthepea Me bitter. As I said in today's blog. I'm absolutely delighted. We have the SNP completely snookered.
.@Dominic_Pike Vast majority of voters don't get what they voted for. Accepting defeat without a murmur is what makes Britain great #GE2015
.@Orca901 Thanks for reading. I feel very strongly about today for obvious reasons. Never forget
.@diogg Thank you David. We need more moderation &amp; we need rational discussion between politicians rather than shouting matches
.@B0MBSKARE On the contrary you object because it is self-evidently true. But happy not to see you again
.@Charnoski There isn't a democratic deficit if Bavaria votes CSU but Germany votes SPD. This is a feature of democracy not a flaw #GE2015
.@SallyVeraCoburn You are just another wee Nat who likes to insult rather than use rational argument. Happy not to see your face again
.@bigduds1 Polling is worthless. We've known that since last Sept. Not only is it worthless it's harming our democracy. It should be ignored
.@ruskadoronin I don't think you understand what we set out to achieve. Read today's blogs and you might get an idea
You may be unaware of the significance of today. You ought not to be. 
.@joebonesthf When you get the abuse that I do you become rather sensitive to be called a slug. But fair enough I've received worse
.@ruskadoronin  If you read todays blog you will find out purpose of #SNPout 

.@Darren_Jameson_ I don't think the SNP quite realise how impotent they are. It matters not at all how many have been elected.
.@SeumasG Next year PR works in our favour. But anyway 56 MPs on the opposition benches are completely impotent. Cameron can just say No
.@joebonesthf No doubt you would think all this 

.@SallyVeraCoburn It's not emotive language it's highly accurate language. SNP supporters try to hide what they're trying to do. I expose it
@jaq1979_jacqui I am invariably polite to opponents
.@SeumasG There are few statesmen in the world today who can see the bigger picture &amp; can think strategically about long term goals
.@DaiAbolic More quite typical abuse from nationalists. You obviously think I'm a slug who lives under rocks as does your friend. Shameful
.@steuartbet This policy was changed by the SNP in the run up to the election. Otherwise they would have had no influence in Westminster
.@SallyVeraCoburn You are albeit peacefully &amp; democratically trying to destroy the UK. That is what we are defending ourselves against
.@ddownie5 Thank you David. We must all learn to disagree as pleasantly as you do
What we achieved twice running 
9th May 
There are two blogs coming up. The first is about today "Victory Day". The second is about our General Election.
.@Dominic_Pike The threats changed how England voted. Now no-one needs to make concessions to SNP. Time to make UK stronger, more united
.@Stephen_Gash No nationalism is OK. British, English, Scottish. They are all equally divisive. Bring down borders don't make new ones
.@DonWillieMiller  You just bumped into Alan Hansen again Willie. It will take a while to realise this, but that's what it amounts toi
We needed overall majority to block the SNP. Thanks Nats for your cooperation you gave it to us. You lose. Hugely amused #GE2015 #Маскировка
.@Bruced872  Маскировка is deception. A lot of people are laughing at the SNP tonight. They are in a cul-de-sac. Their "victory" is defeat
@tregovian @Snoopsrfc Маскировка means camouflage or deception. More about this tomorrow.
.@bridge9118 I'm equally opposed to English nationalism as Scottish nationalism. It would damage England as much as Scotland
.@BadBoabInc Why didn't Nicola promise only to vote on non devolved issues. It would have  lanced the boil immediately
@leeb0147 We'll see. I suspect not in the end
.@Snoopsrfc I suspect I'm far happier at the result than you are. It's known in the trade as Маскировка
SNP have hugely damaged the Left in UK &amp; destroyed it in Scotland. Strangely they call this being progressive #GE2015
We'll really shake them up when we hold Ed's feet to the fire because SNP are the greatest etc. Best laid plans gang aft agley Nicola
.@Raymey1979 Just another Nat who laughs at himself &amp; can't even come up with creative insults. Bye
.@DCM_08 Alex is going to need some pills beginning with V in order to cause any trouble. Impotent indeed.
Nats just keep finding new ways to lose. Even when they win they lose. 56 Nats sitting on the opposition benches. 56 Nats etc #GE2015
.@AJMackinnon Even the insults are just the same. Repeat from the Crib sheet. I'm a Nat. I'm a Nat. I'm a Nat. Explodes into little bits
I'm actually finding today hugely amusing &amp; enjoyable. SNP's whole strategy is a hung parliament, instead they get hung out to dry #GE2015
Has anyone else noticed how the Nats are rather more bitter &amp; twisted than usual. Seems their "Victory" isn't so much fun after all #GE2015
.@homers_twin That's rather a good point actually. SNP have hugely damaged the Left in the UK
.@jgrantkirk More childish taunts from nationalists who seem to be taking their "victory" rather badly. Goodbye
.@pete_at_tweet It was the SNP strategy that destroyed Labour in England too. Vote Lab get Nats drove English into the arms of the Tories
.@LabourOutOfScot Just another Nat who thinks Scotland will become more united by taunting opponents. Just another  block
@WillMcLeod99 How do you know which party I support Will. Perhaps you can see my ballot paper from Washington
.@ScotticusE More abuse from Nats, just not quite as crude as usual. Same block however
There's going to be a non-political blog tomorrow as tomorrow is a very important day to me. More on politics soon as well #ДеньПобеды
I'm rather tired after campaigning hard for a long time. Happy to engage in reasoned debate. But taunts &amp; Mickey taking just get you blocked
.@markspatton81 You dig up a tweet from over a year ago just to taunt. How sad is that? Lucky I won't see you again
.@Ind3pendent7 Here's another "civic nationalist" wanting to kick people out of their home. Shame on you
.@GarryStitchell I don't interact with mickey takers or taunters. There is no point
@celticpete4 I don't think in terms of Scotland, England etc. We are one country and have been for centuries.
.@WalleyVision If Nicola had said they would only vote on non-devolved issues everyone would have thought that was fair. Hubris
.@Fredsmum40 Sorry I don't interact with someone who begins a sentence with bile
.@Stuart_Winton NAts didn't accept result of 1st referendum why would they accept result of 2nd. They had their referendum. Issue is settled
SNP are a left, right &amp; centre party. They are nationalist a populist single issue party who just destroyed the Left in Scotland #GE2015
SNP have holed the left in the UK below the waterline. Tories can always say vote Lab get Nats. And now there's no left in Scotland.
It was the SNP strategy of promising to rule England that drove the English to vote Tory in such massive numbers. Thanks Nicola #GE2015
@dj_gor Thanks. I think we may need to revisit the voting system.
.@TrevorHMoore We need a constitutional convention that comes up with fair &amp; final settlement for everyone &amp; unites our country. Let's hope
@stuart_stumcg SNP won all but 3 seats, but tactical voting much better understood. Actually I'm delighted SNP no influence on govt
@NotAvgAmerican I'd rather not turn Scotland into N.I, though we are about as divided as they are. Nice to be able to look on from afar
.@fleshofmyflesh You don't understand the distinction between nationalism &amp; patriotism. A Dane waving a flag is not a nationalist
@treeblopez I accept the reality. I agree they won 59 seats. But it doesn't matter. You have no influence &amp; we can block you easily
People who care about the UK &amp; oppose nationalism must start thinking of the UK primarily as one country &amp; not four. Let's unite #GE2015
A fair, equal, local form of devolution everywhere in the UK is how we unite our country. Plus a strong central government #GE2015
Don't be pessimistic. The Nats are in a cul-de-sac so long as Cameron blocks them. We need to work on uniting our country #GE2015
We need to continue to educate the electorate on the merits of tactical voting by showing them how it would have kept the #SNPout #GE2015
#SNPout was't a failure. More people in Scotland voted tactically than ever. In nearly every case tactical voting would have beaten the SNP
.@TrevorHMoore But what if Dave simply says No to a future referendum &amp; comes up with fair, equal devolution? We can block SNP easily
.@DennisHammond In most seats in Scotland if voters had followed the wheel the Pro UK candidate would have won.
.@wayside24 I think if we are strong we can block the SNP no matter what. Cameron just has to keep saying No
.@ScotlandsFuture I'm disappointed we lost so many pro-UK Mps in Scotland, but delighted that the UK government will not depend on SNP votes
SNP strategy depended on an outcome they could not control a hung parliament. It now looks foolish #GE2015
Just like voting for the DUP automatically puts you in the others as they only stand in NI so too voting for SNP makes you irrelevant
When you vote for a party that only stands in Scotland don't expect to get the government of your choice in the UK. There are 650 seats
.@NotAvgAmerican I would prefer people did not campaign to break up my country, no doubt you feel same way. But it's their right to do so
@mahkusjaybee I would actually have preferred a Labour majority government. But I prefer any government to one that depends on SNP
.@thehairycaber I think you will find SNP won 50% of the vote. That is sometimes described as half
.@thommok You appear to want me to admit that SNP won 56 seats. I admit it. SNP won 56 seats. Well done. Many congratulations. Happy?
.@graham_st Now we set about uniting the UK with a fair &amp; equal devolution settlement. We can safely leave the SNP to stew. Best ignored
@NotAvgAmerican I don't think that's the issue. The SNP were the major issue in campaign that's what made people vote the way they did
@CrowtherJohn I don't have a crystal ball. If I did I'd have predicted a Tory GE victory bet my house on that &amp; won a fortune
.@thommok The success is that you have no influence and we can block you forever. It's very easy indeed to do this #GE2015
.@NotAvgAmerican If it hadn't been of the SNP we would have a new Labour government today. Of course I would prefer Lab to SNP in Scotland
.@noelchidwick UKIP were driven back into Tory fold by fear of Salmond running England. But that's what SNP wanted
.@callmebexxx I suspect if we compare qualifications I might do rather better than you. But why bother. Insult = block
.@rsmorrow1964  More civic nationalists desperate to drive me out at the point of a bayonet. So much for tolerance in Scotalnd
.@BeeGeeBeard I find using mental illness as a form of abuse deeply offensive. Luckily that was the last time I'll see you
No-one wants their feet held to the fire &amp; so they take steps to avoid it. But then the SNP as we know always wanted a Tory government #GE15
.@SallyVeraCoburn It succeeded more than you realise. SNP has no influence on UK government. It is this that matters most
There's a reason half of Scotland &amp; most of rest of UK can't stand the SNP. We want to keep our country intact. We outnumber you #GE2015
It matters little if you have 6 seats on the opposition benches or 56. You have absolutely no power and no influence #GE2015
Labour voters who chose SNP have seen their choice backfire. They have caused a new Tory govt &amp; destroyed Labour in Scotland &amp; England
I come on twitter to interact with reasonable people &amp; to campaign. I block all taunts automatically. No second chances #GE2015
.@SallyVeraCoburn  SNP genuinely want to break up UK. I accurately point out this truth. No wonder people who like Britain fear you #GE2015
.@twowitty I'm just mad about acne &amp; acne's mad about me. They call it mellow yellow.
.@IndyFreedom2014 If SNP were genuinely wishing to influence a UK government their campaign spectacularly backfired. #GE2015
.@potace69 Hardly. English voters clearly voted in order to avoid SNP having influence on Government. SNP caused Labour defeat #GE2015
.@Brackens1 I too am in favour of PR, but we had a referendum recently &amp; my side lost. We need a decent gap before asking again #GE2015
Many of us are disappointed today, but don't lash out at the UK. Rather rise above party politics and defend our country. We need unity
@mahmooa1 I'm happy when any Pro UK MP wins especially in Scotland. I just wish there were rather more. But still very optimistic
.@mhairigrealis We need everyone who cares about the UK to stick together right now. Division is not inevitable and can easily be stopped
.@sean_mccaff  You don't know me. You don't know what I have achieved. Goodby
.@Paul1Singh We must start thinking in terms of the UK as one country &amp; cease thinking of it as 4. Division is not inevitable #GE2015
@sean_mccaff In effect it was
@CrowtherJohn Whether he'll do so or not is a matter for him. But Cameron can legally block a referendum. So I'm perfectly happy
SNP are completely toxic outside Scotland. They have destroyed Labour in England too. Biggest reason for Ed's defeat #GE2015
.@sueryanjaques Just one of a long line of same old Nats come to taunt.
@Paul1Singh I hope not. I think that would damage England as much as Scotland. We need to pull together and find unity
@umacf24 Salmond can achieve very little when a govt majority opposes him. Just more sound and fury etc
@CrowtherJohn I'd rather be in my position than yours. It's very easy to block another vote on independence.
.@scottmacmusic  I think you will find it is much less significant than you think. Yellow rather than red on opposition benches
@CrowtherJohn So logically people who support the UK should block any further devolution. Just being clear
.@jarviemcleod It will achieve very little. It's very easy to ignore when the Govt has a majority
.@FMBean Devo Max leads to independence very quickly. If you support that you should join the SNP
.@scottmacmusic What do you do if Dave says. Sorry you've had your indyref. Do you have a revolution? That just puts Alex and Nicola in jail
.@WalesForIndy I've been on here all day. But I have a zero tolerance approach to taunting. Doesn't help anyone
.@MalcJo Just another nationalist who gets his kicks from insulting and absuing women. Glad I won't see you again
@CrowtherJohn If there is more devolution UK will not survive. SNP strategy is to make little steps then fall over the line
@MalcJo You clearly have little understanding of law. The precedent is you have to ask &amp; PM can simply say no
@Earindill So? We had a UK election. Your party is quite a small minority in the UK.
If Lab UKIP &amp; Con had voted for Christine Jardine in Gordon she would have beaten Alex Salmond quite easily

A vote for UK to leave the EU makes Scottish independence less likely indeed it makes it impossible 
Full Fiscal Autonomy turns UK into Eurozone &amp; leads to independence later  
There are two main issues to reflect on this morning FFA and Brexit #GE2015
.@grantsimpson284 Hard to say. It all depends on whether Cameron wants to go down in history as the man who broke up the UK #GE2015
@brihall71 By interviewing 20,000 people. Big sample
@scottmacmusic Very easy to prevent a second referendum. Just need to say No.
Cameron needs to think carefully about how to bring unity to the UK. FFA is just one more step towards independence. Bring us together
Both polls &amp; betting got the result massively wrong. Everyone was sure of a hung parliament. We may as well read chicken entrails #GE2015
Imagine if South Carolina told Obama he had no legitimacy to rule their. Sorry Alex you are once more being undemocratic. We are one country
.@donnylives Anyone who cares about UK prosperity should care about UK keeping together. A break up would be an economic catastrophe for all
.@shamit_ghosh As long as Cameron says you already have had your referendum it matters not at all if SNP win all seats in Holyrood
.@frugezze Huge numbers of people voted in UK most of them won't get the government they wanted. This is usually called democracy #GE2015
.@lisofthenorth Cameron does not have to offer the Nats anything. He won remember &amp; the SNP is in on the opposite benches
SNP will be very pleased with themselves for a while until they reflect that they've achieved very little &amp; not a step closer to their goal
.@CrowtherJohn Scotland already has more power than Bavaria and Vermont. Problem in UK is that devolution is neither fair nor equal
.@kfreel No. Not unless the SNP want a revolution. They still have no legal route to independence. It's very easy to block them
Only result I was scared of was a hung parliament with SNP influence. Any majority better than that. Any UK majority blocks SNP forever
.@JulesAnneBond Still digesting it. Disappointed SNP won so many seats, but pleased they have no influence. We can block them forever
.@mahmooa1 Lots of people voted &amp; were disappointed. That's democracy. You played your part. That's all we can ever do.
@OTBeth131 Yes. Seems obvious to me
.@CrowtherJohn Strike me that English nationalism won one seat last night. So much for that then
.@ScotMcgill  All taunters will immediately be blocked. It's just another form of abuse &amp; does nothing to help Scotlalnd. Goodbye
It may be a streak of perversity, but I'm rather amused by this result. SNP have no influence &amp; are to blame for new Tory government #GE2015
SNP would have preferred 20 seats plus influence &amp; a hung parliament to all of them &amp; no influence at all. Sometimes you can do too well
If you oppose the SNP stop thinking of UK as 4 countries &amp; start thinking of it as 1. If you don't you only help them. We need unity
Lib Dems put country before party &amp; have been punished for it. We really need rather more grown up elections in the UK.
Far more people in the UK will not get the government that they want than in Scotland. This is usually called democracy. Remember that
Opinion polls have become about as useful as astrology. It is time now to sack the lot of the pollsters. They do harm &amp; should be ignored
UK now needs a constitutional convention that brings fair equal, devolution &amp; unity. Other countries have achieved this why not us?
Clear now that Labour committed suicided in 1997. It took 18 years to die. We need a different approach that brings both local power &amp; unity
If Cameron remains prime minister it is crucial that he makes No deals with the SNP &amp; just says No. Don't underestimate them again Dave
I suspect there will be rather a lot of disgusting taunting &amp; abuse on my timeline. So apologies if I miss your comment
It is a UK election &amp; frankly my dear I don't give a damn whether parts of the UK vote differently from the whole. We are one country
We must attack the SNP at its roots. Never has this article been more relevant as today

There will be difficult times ahead but if we have a government that's not dependent on the SNP that will be a huge bonus
Destroying Labour in Scotland looks like giving the SNP what they wanted. A Tory government in Westminster. Well done
Congratulations to SNP opponents who have done very well. Well done.
We've put in a massive effort. Be proud of that whatever happens. We'll build on this for future battles. Thanks to everyone #SNPout #Ge2015
Whatever happens tomorrow keep fighting for our country. What we share is more important than what divides us. Remember that if nothing else
To be clear my involvement with #SNPout has always been peripheral. I just help with tweets. The team deserves the credit #GE2015
To turn things around twice in one year would be some achievement. #SNPout deserves massive credit whatever the result #GE2015
@robertos0511 No-one is claiming victory. Hell of a chance means only that
.@Gillebrighde I'm polite &amp; write reasoned articles. No similar nationalist has received the abuse that I do. Breaking up UK is not moderate
@Gillebrighde Fair enough, but the SNP will use any increase in support to push towards independence. So too will they use change
@CrowtherJohn I told our side in September not to taunt opponents. It just creates division.
@CrowtherJohn We need worthy opponents to make life interesting. I have a lot of time for some SNP people who are sincere &amp; dedicated
@Gillebrighde Yes. I talk to lots of moderates and enjoy the discussion. But the abuse has been getting out of hand so have little patience
@tregovian Most likely result I think is Con/LD minority. Markets may be banking on that
@Longhouses1 @dannyalexander If I lived where you do, I'd have done the same. He's done a good job. Deserves to keep helping UK economy
.@Woohafication If I were you I'd watch the exit poll and then go to bed. We'll know nothing for sure until 4 or 5 perhaps not even then
Message to Nats. I have zero tolerance policy to taunting opponents. Blocking you gives me huge amounts of pleasure #SNPout #GE2015
I have a feeling we're going to get some surprises tonight. A little bird tells me Christine Jardine has a hell of a chance #SNPout #GE2015
.@GaryTheDandy87 Is that you at the taunting stage even before the votes have been counted? Do you think that's going to help Scotland?
Still 5 hours to cast your vote <NEGATIVE SQUARED CROSS MARK> 
I will keep on writing, with blogs about politics &amp; other topics. We need to build up social media for battles to come. Never stop fighting
Always do what your opponent least wants. Be strong, no matter what happens. Be optimistic. Our position is much better than theirs #SNPout
Always show good morale in the face of whatever taunts may be thrown at us or whatever aggression or abuse. Don't let it touch you #SNPout
We need to keep on campaigning tomorrow to make sure no-one makes any deals with SNP. Who knows there may be another election soon #SNPout
@ro_iain I very much hope Cons don't offer FFA. It equals poverty and independence very soon indeed
NOM is as good as guaranteed by the market, even Tories have given up. h…
@unarguablemike My apologies if I misunderstood your intentions.
Seems Nats are plotting who to taunt tomorrow. Let's try to make our country even more divided 

.@unarguablemike Disagreement with SNP is not hatred towards Scotland nor to SNP supporters. I don't hate anyone. It only damages your self
Sorry for the deliberate mistake folks. Getting rather tired
#SNPout is an apolitical campaign that favours neither Lib Lab or Con. We disagree with the SNP but we hate no-one. We just love our country
There'll be seats on the list won or lost by less than 100 votes. Your vote makes a difference. Choose wisely #SNPout 
.@walker_sal It's very important that morale is kept hight. We have a long fight ahead of us for the future of our country. All will be well
If you're from Aberdeen North you must vote for Richard Baker   @VoteBaker2015 Lab has best chance to keep #SNPout 
@TraffordLj Doing so right now.
There may be seats tomorrow that the SNP win by a whisker. You're going to feel a fool if you don't vote #SNPout 
.@jimfraser I'm hopeful in all of them, but if I could predict the future I would be a multi millionaire by means of horse racing
SNP have a goal that isn't really possible in modern world. They are a party of sound &amp; fury that signifies nothing. Remember that #SNPout
The most important long term strategic issues have been ignored in our GE 
Above all don't worry. One hundred years from now there will still be a UK. There are many more who love our country than hate it #SNPout
@Historywoman Whatever happens we need to continue fighting. There will be other campaigns &amp; morale will be crucial
.@RabTheLaddie Don't use mental illness as a way of abusing opponents. It's hugely offensive. Perhaps members of your family have been ill
This is the day when you take one for the team. For the UK. It's a rare privilege that you have the chance #SNPout 
@81beesfan Thanks. My point is that we can always outnumber them from a UK perspective. But of course I will always keep fighting
@DonnellyHugh I expect SNP to do well tomorrow. Congrats. But not sure it will make a long term difference. Of course I could be wrong
@OfficialBartin I think 45 will vote SNP. But it's not enough. We're in same position as last September.
@Snoopsrfc I will talk of other things. Good luck to you Huggy &amp; many congratulations if your side does well
Our opponents may or may not do well. Who knows. Frankly who cares. It doesn't actually matter. We can block them forever #SNPout #GE2015
The purpose of taunting is for you to reply in kind. You can defeat it with politeness &amp; you also make them look small #SNPout #GE2015
We've been here before. But I'm a lot less nervous than in September. Above all be confident. We've seen off worse than this lot #SNPout
Congratulate our opponents if they taunt you. I'd far rather be in our position than theirs. Above all keep fighting no matter what #SNPout

#SNPOut
@benjaminsinger Some people have been putting up false tactical voting guides
@CJuliaSM People with local information on the ground must make the call. We are only providing a guide
.@Snoopsrfc I disagree with the SNP. I have never hated them nor to I hate their supporters. I'm not even rude to those who hate me #SNPout
In the great scheme of things it doesn't matter much whether one Pro UK MP wins rather than another. It's our country that matters #SNPout
Nats continue underhand tactics right to the end. This is the guide. Use it to keep out the sneaky Nats #SNPout 
This is the final tactical voting guide. Sorry if you're disappointed. But this is our best guess. Vote #SNPout 
.@Snoopsrfc This is a UK election &amp; if the SNP are outnumbered that is the will of the people. There is no other electorate #SNPout #GE2015
I think we're going to do well tomorrow, but whatever happens don't be despondent rather come out fighting ready for new battles #SNPout
Watch out for underhand Nat tactics. Here is the #SNPout guide. Would you vote for a party without any honour? 
Nicola Sturgeon has just been heard shouting "We're all right" at a victory rally #SNPout #GE2015
Only vote for the SNP if you actually want independence as that's the only thing they want #SNPout #GE2015 Won't get fooled again
Not much more we can say. What matters is what you do tomorrow. We need a huge turnout. Every vote matters #SNPout 
@RWDF1 I fully understand when people don't want to vote tactically. I felt the same way for many years. But not this time
Still unsure how to vote tactically. This is the very latest #SNPout information. #GE2015 Use common sense 
UK economy is overtaking France yet SNP want to take the Hollande route that makes us all poorer 
.@frugezze The moon can be made of green cheese it just depends on your definition of moon and cheese. This is all very silly indeed
This article from Neil Lovatt is rather brilliant.  

.@frugezze Sorry. SNP are campaigning for independence. You know that as well as I do so let's not kid each other #SNPout #GE2015
.@UKTacticalVoter  Tactical voting in Scotland is most likely to help Labour. But really the whole point is to rise above party politics
@frugezze SNP are not campaigning for federalism
@alextickell No. It's a higher principle
@robbiemac1808 I don't recognise it exists. Only people who loathe themselves think there's a cringe. I've never experienced it. Have you?
We all love the English cry the Nats. Some of our best friends are English. By the way are you English? #SNPout #GE2015
Don't be afraid says Nicola we only want to break up your country and cause years of chaos with the divorce 
.@kh_99 Tactical voting is difficult I quite agree. But for the greater good it is sometimes necessary to make a small sacrifice #SNPout
.@truthylir There are an awful lot of nationalists who hate Britain, Brits, Westminster or whatever other euphemism they can come up with
.@EEddiewilson  So what. Are you people are all anglophobes?
.@GML1320 Your lack of humour is becoming very tiresome. Plus your obvious anglophobia. I make a simple joke and you have to read into it
.@humol62 Read it and weep. 

It's going to take more than this lot to do us any lasting harm. We've seen off much worse. Who do you think you are kidding Mrs Sturgeon
Be calm. Be confident. We have a good plan in place to block the SNP no matter how many seats they win or don't win. We're working together
Whatever happens keep fighting &amp; keep campaigning. Don't stop on Thursday. Our country is at stake. We always win in the end #SNPout #GE2015
Don't be despondent. We're turning this thing around just like we did last year. Nats will do much worse than they think #SNPout #GE2015
We need to be generous. Lab needs to vote Con, Con needs to vote Lab, all to keep #SNPout. This is much bigger than party politics
.@ford_ford6 I'm hearing very good things about Christine Jardine's chances in Gordon. Salmond no where to be seen. Repeat of last Sept

@ronague I was tweeting about economic recovery not the merits or otherwise of leaving the EU
.@DavidCockerham It's indyref II but without the scariness. Proportions will be more or less the same. But No vote split 3 ways
.@ComradeHutch Anyone looking for some motivation in the coming days would be well advised to have a look at Wesley's video #SNPout #GE2015

UK economic recovery is best in Europe. But SNP prefer to follow black line down to poverty. Why? #SNPout #GE2015 
Don't even think about the Nats at the moment. Think about getting out side out in massive numbers and getting them to vote to keep #SNPout
.@alexgallagher2 In large parts of Scotland Labour has the only chance of beating the SNP. Libs and Cons have duty to vote to keep #SNPout
On one side of the coin there's the smiles &amp; the hand of friendship on the other there's the snarling mob. It's the same coin #SNPout
SNP are trying to use GE success as a means to push for independence. If you want to keep UK intact vote to keep #SNPout It's that simple
We beat them on turnout in September we can do it again, but we have to be clever this time. Vote tactically. Keep the #SNPout
Everything I've wrote in past few years can be summed up by #SNPout We need a huge turnout to protect our country 
@CrowtherJohn Have a pleasant day. That is all part of democracy. I hope there's always a high turnout in all elections
Most important factor we can change is turnout. Think about ways you can encourage &amp; help people to vote to keep #SNPout #GE2015
.@sorentoman I had one Nat who thought GERS was an abbreviation for Rangers. He didn't know much about economics #SNPout
.@robertos0511 I don't feel particularly patriotic but patriotism is not nationalism. A Dane waving a flag is not a nationalist #SNPout
I keep having the same conversation. Very tired of it. If you ask me if I am any sort of nationalist I will block you. Next second #SNPout
.@nairnkev  No. Only someone who does not understand the meaning of the word "nationalism" would as such a question
@robertos0511 No it self evidently is not.
If you'd told me 5 years ago that mobs would attack campaigning politicians in Scotland I would have told you it was impossible #SNPout
If your seat becomes SNP by a whisker you will kick yourself if you didn't vote to keep #SNPout Make sure it doesn't happen #GE2015
Creepy how Nats send an inquisitor to interrogate. Starts off friendly enough but they're worse than those who begin by swearing #SNPout
.@christianosway Anyone who calls me a nationalist immediately gets blocked. I've explained why dozens of times. It's insulting &amp; false
.@michaelhopcroft "Most dangerous kind of nationalist" is deeply offensive to me. You start off friendly and then stick the boot in. Ends
.@michaelhopcroft  I've explained frequently why I am not a nationalist &amp; to be honest I've been getting enough abuse lately without you
.@michaelhopcroft There's one written a while back called why I'm not a nationalist. Looks prophetic now

@4thProtocol I really appreciate the support. Many thanks to the writer.

.@michaelhopcroft If you've ready any of my blog you know exactly what I am referring to. Have a look by all means 
Some people are taking their support for the SNP a little too far #SNPout #GE2015 
Tactical voting is turning things around. Tell friends and family to vote for candidate who has best chance of beating the Nats #SNPout
Christine Jardine has a good chance of beating Salmond, but she needs every vote 
.@skottska If desire for national unity was nationalism nearly everyone in every country would be a nationalist. That clearly is meaningless
UK is one country. Anyone with a majority overall has a mandate to rule everywhere 
.@umacf24 It's caused by me. But that is an uncaused cause. That is bedrock. If caused by biology then I'm just a stimulus response machine
.@roughyed1969 But then it doesn't matter. They are still stuck on 45%. A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing
.@tregovian That is more or less the same point. It's the bits that are left out that are important, the truths we glimpse in passing.
.@michaelhopcroft I have personal experience of what happens when nationalism is whipped up. That is why I oppose it. It starts like this
@Tufty1903 I'm very grateful to you Colin. I have blocked.
@Tufty1903 Thank you again. So many follow me I find it hard to keep up.
Throwing away the ladder 
@Ergasiophobe Quite so. But I don't think there are many fewer No voters than last September. But FPTP screws us.
.@BeeGeeBeard Yes isn't split. No is split 3 ways. That's why we have to campaign as we do. My guess No/Yes will end up 55/45 like last time
@BeeGeeBeard Good point well made. SNP delighted a year ago with 12 seats. Now 30 looks like a disappointment. Even 20 a remarkable result
@don_stuart No problem Don. I like your manner &amp; happy to have forthright views
@hamsieshark Brain in a vat is a solitary castle we can't attack scepticism but neither can it attack us. Can be left safely in our rear
I was full of doubt last year even when we were 20 points ahead. But Nats love to call the result early. We'll really shake them up etc
Nats are everywhere with their leaflets &amp; their balloons, but it was the same last September. Not a No poster in any window, but we won
SNP folk have been getting their taunts in early. Some of them are going to look very foolish if they don't do as well as expected #SNPout
Scary Nats are going to get a lot of pro UK people out on Thursday voting tactically to keep them out. Tell friends/family #SNPout #GE2015
I hear the SNP are campaigning very hard everywhere. Why if they are so sure of winning all the seats? #SNPout #GE2015
.@hamsieshark I'll have to think about that one. In the end I take basic experience as fundamental. Why doubt what is immediate?
@don_stuart Sorry to have offended Don. We may disagree on some details, but we also agree on much I think

@cleanandlight1 Happy for you to hold your views but why contact me about them?
@UnionistLeague Why not?
.@thegandydancer It's not possible to understand everything. The deepest truth is beyond our understanding. It can only be glimpsed
@stmadoessaint My tone remains the same. I fight hard, but try to treat opponents with respect. I have many SNP friends online. Not personal


.@neilfinlayson Just for you here is another blog taking it's starting point from Dostoevsky. Thanks for suggestion

Throwing away the ladder 
@stmadoessaint I don't know what will happen in next few years, but on 19th Sept. I commiserated with opponents who were dissapointed
.@stmadoessaint I expect you will be taunting away somehow thinking that this will help Scotland. Why not get your taunts in early?
@MarkGJSpalding WW2 is much closer to Russians than it is to us. Every family was touched by it in ways we can barely imagine
This is brilliant. The UK needs radical, fair constitutional reform, that all can subscribe to  
@timmokx We don't know how many died. Some thing perhaps twice that. The West ignored what Red Army did. Most still have no clue
@beatoniser What you say Ian is indeed true. Communists killed more innocent people than anyone else. Massively more
.@WiseScot Too many people think being Scottish involves supporting the SNP. It doesn't the majority of Scots reject them #'SNPout #GE2015
.@randomdad1967 Shostakovich also incredible for courage. Sat on his stairs for years waiting to be taken away so as not to wake neighbours
3 blogs already this weekend, but I'm not finished. Tomorrow by special request I return to the big questions that make SNP seem trivial.
@beatoniser There was wrong on both sides this is very true. I would not want to cover it up.
@JetNeuf15 My husband is Russian so I get told the tales from long ago. Rough times
@JetNeuf15 In charge of Soviet Union was Stalin. Very evil man, but so what the Soviet people saved Europe from fascism.
@JetNeuf15 It's about an important anniversary commemorating the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens being completely ignored &amp; boycotted
Whatever our disagreements with Putin, I disagree too, everyone should commemorate what Soviet citizens did 70 years ago
@JetNeuf15 It's celebrated one day later in Russia because of time zone's or some such.
Something far more important is happening this week than a General election. On 9th May is 70th anniversary of victory day #День Победы
@UnionistLeague I'm afraid I don't know who Tufty is, but I like your profile summary.
@RossJamieson3 I think if you read the article the "threat" is to give Scotland what it wants
What's so great about Britain? 
@CrowtherJohn Just campaign chatter. It could all be nonsense of course
@CrowtherJohn It's very hard to predict politics even a week in advance let alone a year. It will be interesting but much is very uncertain
.@cnmf1976 There have been an awful lot of nationalists recently making derogatory comments about mental health. It can affect any of us
.@DonsAndDynamo I've only ever heard SNP supporters describe Scotland as a colony. As I said if we are a colony who are the colonisers?
How many more people will turn out &amp; vote tactically because of scary SNP polls. It's September except it's in May #SNPout #GE2015
.@raygree26470295 I quite agree. It is unfair to hold every Scot responsible for the SNP
.@hamsieshark Scotland is not a territory or a colony. If you think it is who are the colonisers? English, Poles? It's not a nice argument
I'm hearing all these scary SNP polls are having a similar effect to last September. They are changing behavior #SNPout #GE2015
@hamsieshark  I think everyone recognises that Northern Ireland is a special case. How about indivisible except Northern Ireland? Satisfied?
@CrowtherJohn There are always parallels and differences, but you don't seem to want to answer the question. I wonder why?
.@CrowtherJohn I asked you earlier do you think it was wrong for Lincoln to prevent the Confederacy from seceding?
@CrowtherJohn Perhaps its the way you read it. Who knows.
Anyone fancy a Nicola Guevara T-shirt? Yet they complain about being compared to tyrants

.@calumcarr Please read my blog please read my blog. I did. You missed the point. Now pester me no more.
.@CrowtherJohn US became indivisible because of war that decided the issue, in same way UK now indivisible because we decided peacefully
A Letter from Scotland to America 
.@calumcarr Calum Your sort of pester power becomes silly.I didn't find anything in your blog worthy of further comment or debate
.@CrowtherJohn I can't imagine from where you get that idea. Do you disagree with Lincoln for instance?
.@CrowtherJohn None at all. I was asked to contribute an article to a friends blog. It's nice to have support from overseas however
.@BRRSC I am about as polite as it's possible to be on twitter, but get abuse from aggressive Scottish nationalists
Longbows and Rosary Beads: A Letter from Scotland to America... 
@SeumasG Happy for things to evolve, but we can't live through permanent revolution without their being chaos
.@TraffordLj She's both Cromwell in Ireland for that reason and the ultimate founder of New Labour all those years later
.@iansireland  We also need fair devolution everywhere and a final constitutional settlement that actually works for the long term
.@iansireland I think we need calm and quiet. I favour Lib Lab Con pact that looks after economy and not much else. Ignore the Nats #SNPout
.@KFeeOD Danny Alexander has done a good job helping the UK economy. Pity to repay him with the sack #SNPout #GE2015
.@4Derek The best person who explains the economics is @kevverage

Scots are in for a shock when the English run out of patience 
.@TraffordLj But if he had know Lab wouldn't get back in until 1997. Damaging your economic reputation can have long term consequencess
.@BlueBorders1 To clarify. I meant Scotland went from having 25-30 Con MPs to having 0 or 1. Lots still vote Con
.@Johnvoteyes At the moment I think you will find we get out of the UK rather more than we pay in. This is usually called sharing
.@KFeeOD Tory is quite literally meaningless. Red, Yellow, blue, tartan. We are all Tories or else none of us
@Chris1966 We can all speculate, but we'll find out on Friday. I haven't believed a single poll since last September.
.@VeryBritishDude Not universally, but the Cons were destroyed in Scotland &amp; large numbers of people do hate them
.@highconstable With hindsight and if we could go backwards we would no doubt do things differently knowing where it all would lead
.@thegandydancer The trouble with having a bogey-woman in Scottish politics is that it hinders rational discussion. It was all very long ago
.@EyeEdinburgh I think we have to wait for a few years between referendums. It's undemocratic not to do so.
.@mcjwalsh I prefer politics with no hatred of any kind. It should be a civilised rational debate about how best to run the country
.@ge2015bot People in Scotland have been blinded by nationalism so that we are unable to realise quite how lucky we are living in the UK
,@timmokx I mention it all the time. My guess is that there's a 50/50 chance there will be one. #GE2015
.@alanthegasman I don't think that is a reasonable analysis. Tactical voting benefits Labour the most. Just look at the wheel
It’s hatred of Tories that is destroying Labour in Scotland 
@NMQ_Edi It will matter to me not at all. It won't make any difference. Besides he's been my MP before
@BeeGeeBeard I would love to see UK like Germany or USA. Lots of local democracy, but also a central government. I'd campaign for that
@SeumasG I too was disappointed with the referendum on AV, but my side lost. That's democracy
@BeeGeeBeard There is a compromise that's possible, but it's not independence. Some sort of equal devolution plus unity is what I want
@SeumasG The answer to the House of Lords as I said in the blog is to reform it.
@BeeGeeBeard I view matters from a UK perspective. If Scotland votes differently to whole UK no different than if Cornwall does
I don't think anyone is going to work with the SNP &amp; no-one is going to allow another indyref. This is called being snookered #SNPout #GE15
Above all don't worry. We've a good plan for stopping SNP on Thursday &amp; a good plan of ignoring them in WM. We've seen off worse #SNPout
Don't try to convince those who can't be convinced. What matters getting the clear tactical voting message across to our side #SNPout
In the last few days focus on getting our side to vote massively. We can beat them on turnout like we did last September #SNPout
Nats peak too early and call the result before it's even been counted. But at least they have practice at coming second. #SNPout #GE2015
Your task is to identify who has the best chance of beating SNP. Use the wheel as a guide. We must all vote #SNPout 
We have a simple message. Anyone is better than SNP. For that reason blue rinse Tories are voting for Murphy. They will save him #SNPout
I hear Nats are out in force in Gordon. Why campaign so hard unless they think they might lose? They will if we all vote to keep #SNPout
@SeumasG I use the following list 
@BeeGeeBeard I agree.I'm not against reform. I'm all for it. I'd prefer much more local democracy for a start
@debatescotland I agree. there are more democratic countries than UK. We should aspire to do better. But there are also many worse
.@pameladeakin People who complain about democracy in UK should try living in a country that isn't a democracy. It feels rather different
@CrowtherJohn I don't believe I have done that in today's blog, nor indeed elsewhere
.@robhesk @ClareBridges12 UK is respected and like nearly everywhere apart from in the UK. Peculiar #SNPout #GE2015
.@KeithRSteele @MajorDMalpas Thank you both Keith &amp; David. Too many people in UK have forgotten that we live in a pretty decent country
.@Haitch7 It's vital to point out what's mistaken about our opponents argument but equally vital to make the positive case for our own #GE15
.@BeeGeeBeard I'm putting forward a counterargument to those SNPers who can only see wrong in Britain. I'm implying nothing else #SNPout
.@sunshineonleith Thank you Eileen. Too many people in Scotland forget how lucky we are compared to 99% of the world's population #GE2015
.@GLASNOSTORGUK We too often in Scotland forget how lucky we are to live in  a place that is prosperous and free.
@calumcarr  No problem at all all. Thanks for response. We both think that the other begs the question. From my point of view you do
@calumcarr  I don't respond to every tweet that is sent me. I don't have time. There are too many and my time line is often unpleasant
.@EyeEdinburgh Accepting the result does not imply that anyone has to work with the SNP if there is a democratic way of avoiding doing so
.@EyeEdinburgh if SNP win all 59 seats of course I would accept it. It's not as if I would ask for a rerun because I didn't like the result
.@BeeGeeBeard It's for SNP supporters to justify breaking up something that works. I'm putting my positive argument you need counterargument
What's so great about Britain? 
@Dr_Teacake Thanks Doc
.@campbellsing Truth is not democratic. Something is so or it isn't whatever the majority thinks
@debatescotland  Long time since I read it. I remember disagreeing with some. Prefer Julie or the New Heloise to be honest
.@campbellsing The analogy I always use is that Scotland is a country in the way that Fife is a kingdom or the Black Isle is an island
.@NotAvgAmerican All countries are made up of places that once were independent, including Scotland. There's nothing special about this
.@NotAvgAmerican Nearly every country in Europe is made up of places that formerly were independent countries. I can name dozens
.@ac_anton Why discuss at all then. Why contact me. I would never contact you especially as you have no arguments
.@campbellsing I explain everything in the link I gave you. Not much point debating if you are unaware of my argument
@craigjduncan @kevverage Thank you Craig.
This makes voting for the SNP utterly pointless  
.@diogg  I couldn't bear to vote for the SNP because of the nature of so many of it's supporters. Wouldn't vote for them even if wanted indy
.@campbellsing You're just repeating your view not debating mine. You have to try to come up with a counterargument
.@Eagle_force_555 Scotland already has more power than Bavaria, Saxony, Texas or Vermont. What's lacking is equal devolution
.@campbellsing I've long argued that SNP depends on a strange misunderstanding of word country.  

.@KeithRSteele There will be more blogs this weekend. Of course I keep writing
.@Eagle_force_555 I would be happy if UK were like Germany or USA. They have equal devolution plus strong central govt. They are united
I was taught to think clearly &amp; write clearly and directly. I apply this to politics and get character assassination. I am not the extremist
In none of my blogs will you find anything extremist. It's not extremist to oppose break up of your country. Otherwise whole world extremist
I hold moderate views about most political topics, I can usually see some merit in some views of all mainstream political parties
My political views are those of a moderate centrist who doesn't want her country to break up I find the alternatives extreme #GE2015 #SNPout
.@holland_tom Thank you Tom. I try to state views clearly and back them up by argument. My arguments never attack people as individuals
.@paulieboy1  Another nationalist who thinks abuse is richly deserved. That being provocative justifies the abuser in abusing
.@Haitch7 When opponents come to me with reasoned counterarguments I greet them as friends. Why can't we debate in this way? #GE2015
@Donald_Darra We have a debate. I respect all those who disagree with me in a reasoned way. It's good fun too
@EyeEdinburgh Most of us have friends or family who have or will have problems with mental health. It should not be used as an insult
@EyeEdinburgh  I'm very grateful to you Jane. Much appreciated.
@WellingtonCone Wherein lies the difference?
I never attack SNP supporters personally I only attack SNP arguments. Attack my arguments, not me!

So much of the abuse I get comes from those who don't read carefully what I write or read into it what they themselves have put
.@PhotoTweetyScot My tone is almost universally polite. I mock occasionally, but mildly. I make bold statements, but back them with reason
.@WellingtonCone That's a trivial debating point. I didn't say that Scotland could not become a state. Of course it could one party or not
Some think my views OTT. Fair enough, but everything I write is backed up by an argument. I may be wrong of course, but use counterargument
Blogging is about making readers think. It's a challenge to debate. It's interesting and useful to both sides if we use reason.
.@WiseScot I think in a couple of seats it genuinely is impossible to know for sure. In these local knowledge &amp; agreement must prevail
.@umacf24 There are SNP folk who give good reasoned arguments. Great people. But lots just fling abuse
@obritom Always happy to. If I happen not to see your post give me a direct message.
@NiclasReddish I'm happy for people not to agree. That's the point of blogging. But let's use reason to argue
@NiclasReddish Thank you Niclas
.@WalesForIndy When you make an analogy it does not imply that you think the thing is the same. This is very simple logic
@obritom I use this one. It's really only a guide. Local knowledge &amp; local agreement can trump this 
@WalesForIndy I don't
.@WalesForIndy Are you agreeing with me that the campaign should be turned off or sending for reinforcements?
@middelburg_ger Doing fine. It's unpleasant, but makes me fight all the harder
@JenTheJudge Thanks you Jennifer. The abuse makes me fight harder.
.@EyeEdinburgh Very sensible idea. I do too. Mental illness is something we all may suffer one day. It should not be used as abuse
Nat response to my article thus far has been you are provocative, you were asking for it &amp; you deserved it. Not one has expressed sympathy
.@geom66  Today I blogged about the abuse I've been getting. For the most part I've received yet more

.@bitsybumble I used something called argument from analogy. I have not been criticised I have been abused. And you obviously condone it
.@Dungarbhan @Southsidegrrrl @bitsybumble Thought somehow you wouldn't express any sympathy. Just as complicit as the abusers.
.@Historywoman Thanks Jill. It's vital we all stand up against this sort of abuse or Scotland won't be a country worth living in
.@Serosedserio14 It's nasty but well deserved, sums up the attitude of all the SNP supporters today.
.@Serosedserio14 Not much sympathy coming from you. It's all my fault. Why not try to influence those who share your views
@emtaylor_3 I've picked up on that. I'm provocative. I deserve it. I was asking for it. Not  pleasant way to argue
@Tweets2CV I know you are Ron. I'm agreeing with you. It's inevitable if people have the mindset they have in Scotland
@highconstable If we continue to treat Scotland as if it were independent it will become independent &amp; rightly so. That's the logic
.@Tweets2CV Don't play the nationalist card in politics you have no idea where it will lead
@Martin_Veart Thanks for the support Martin. Much appreciated
.@highconstable I respect that opinion too, but I think it leads inevitably to  independence
.@highconstable I back my opinion with logic however. I think there is one country UK the parts are called countries but are not in fact
.@benjaminsinger  Not much sympathy from you then. No doubt the abuse is well deserved
@TheBluetrot Thank you Brian. That is much appreciated
.@ac_anton Not much sympathy from you then
.@Annette1Hardy This is just a few of the one's that can be found by searching my timeline. This is relentless and deeply wrong
.@DougieCM Thanks Douglas. We need to get this message across. The attacks on campaigners like me is completely unacceptable #SNPout
This campaign of hatred must be turned off 
@YesGlasgow420 I'm happy for change to make UK work better &amp; more fairly. Not sure this is what nationalists want however
.@Dorokusai_tweet UK's existence was never threatened in any wars. What I say is self evidently true. SNP is an existential threat to UK
.@Sharonwifey Shall we compare qualifications or will I just block you for yet more Nat abuse. No need to compare is there. Gone
Apparently Scotland won't be divided when we all vote SNP. Who says they don't want a one party state #SNPout #GE15 
@GeorgeFoulkes Sounds excellent. I would support that. Very well done hope it gets passed
Politicians from all parties must find a fair solution to the UK where everyone gets a fair &amp; equal amount of devolved power #GE2015
Long term it is completely trivial whether Ed or Dave is PM. Our country's future is massively more important #GE2015
There's an awful lot of taunting of political opponents at the moment. No doubt there will be next week. Doesn't really heal the wound
SNP are popular with some very unpopular with others. But do they have a plan for ending the division in Scotland #GE2015
.@RichieWhitelaw If the UK were not a country Scotland would be independent. Do you think the United States is not a country?
.@WLWASIOH No doubt you would like to drive all no voters out with pitchforks. And they say Scotland isn't divided
Once more for saying something self evidently true I get waves of nats who simply insult, abuse &amp; misinterpret #SNPout #GE2015
@candersonabc 140 letters
.@wikisneedia I'm not comparing SNP to Nazis. They obviously are not. My point is UK more under threat now than any time in 300 years. True
@bgreysk @tehvlb France came out of world war ii intact. This is true
@GML1320 I haven't said anything about Nazis. So why bring up Godwin's law. Now you are wasting time
.@ian_kemp If Scotland is a colony who are the colonisers? Scotland of course is not a colony &amp; never has been it's a part of the UK #GE2015
@GML1320 I haven't mentioned Nazis. You did by mentioning Godwin
In the next few weeks we are going to need statesmen &amp; women who are willing to rise above party politics for the good of the UK #GE2015
SNP threat to UK is democratic but it doesn't make it any less of a threat. If anything it puts us in a more risky situation #GE2015 #SNPout
SNP want people in UK to be unaware of the threat they pose to our country. That's why they get annoyed when someone does #GE2015 #SNPout
In 300 years of history who other than SNP has wanted to break up UK. Yet they try to shout me down when I tell the truth #SNPout #GE2015
.@tehvlb France came out of World War II intact even if it was invaded. No war threatened the UK with break up.
.@McKendrickDave  At no point in any war involving UK was the UK threatened with being broken up.
Saw someone laughing about how many Lab seats might be lost in Scotland. No UK supporters should cheer on SNP. Its frankly unpatriotic
When you recognise your country is threated, the first thing to do is to resolve not to work with nor help those who threaten us #GE2015
People in UK need to wake up to the threat to our country coming from the SNP. It's a democratic threat, but no less real for that #GE2015
.@yanic1965 At no point in any of these conflicts was the UK's existence under threat. It is now. That's what you campaign for
.@BarrymoirPhoto Fine I was simply pointing out that SNP is greatest threat to UK in 300 years. It obviously is
Pointing out something that's true is not scaremongering. Neither is it is hyperbole. To counter we need to recognise what we're up against
It is self-evidently true that UK is more in danger of breaking up than at any point in its 300 year history. The reason for this is the SNP
.@WingsScotland You talked of terror. It's all perfectly democratic, but UK more at risk from SNP than anyone else I can think of in 300 yrs
.@WingsScotland You misunderstand Stuart. There's no physical danger from SNP. But they're threat to existence of UK. Biggest for 300 years
.@SturgeonSexy I grew up in  60s &amp; 70s. We were much poorer then than now. No comparison at all. We're much better off than most in EU too
.@JohnSMcConnell  I am too. But it's not hyperbole. UK is more in danger than has been for 300 years. If we face facts we can stop them
.@JohnSMcConnell Existence of UK in present form was far more threatened in 2014 than 1940. No comparison.
.@Katie497 I know 100% that Sturgeon plans a 2nd indyref in 2016. Who do you think you are kidding?
We've had Lab govts &amp; Con govts. They've been good bad &amp; indifferent. But SNP are greatest threat to our country in 300 years #SNPout
.@Katie497 I know you want people to believe this, but the SNP wants an independence referendum as soon as possible. No doubt so do you
.@richie_1994wale I think you need to focus more on protecting the UK. Party politics matters little when our country is threatened #GE2015
Remember this is a UK election. In every democracy there are parts which vote differently to the whole. Pro UK MPs outnumber Nats #SNPout
Here's a great idea. Let's elect foul mouthed cybernats. That will really help Scotland's reputation 
If pollsters get this election as wrong as they did indyref can we all just ignore them in the future. Doing more harm than good #GE2015
Very good article by @mcollinsucl in today's Herald. It's worth an RT

@Realgone77 Wheel is a guide. Local agreement always possible. I had nothing to do with making the wheel just tweet about it.
.@4Derek Expectations of SNP success are so high. More interesting now how many do we have to win for your campaign to be a failure? Careful
.@Singapom SNP are picking activists at random to be candidates. But then it doesn't matter as they all promise to do what Nicola says
 
@timmokx When I share an article it doesn't mean I agree with all of it. If that were the case I wouldn't share any article
@jimfraser That works sometimes, but most voters vote for the party. Nats could pick any activist as a candidate  wouldn't matter
There are real risks for the SNP in supporting a minority Labour government from @mcollinsucl

@cashley_ade It leads to chaos and division if we are lucky, if we are unlucky it leads to worse. I have seen this happen.
@jimfraser Without a party I would sink like a stone. Just a shy wee Aberdeenshire quine anyway
@Ian_Burnett_ Couldn't give a toss about typos. I type too quickly to notice. All very uninteresting
I have the feeling sometimes that online abuse is an SNP campaign tactic. Who switches it on &amp; off?  
In September I continually tweeted about reconciliation &amp; peace, being generous to opponents. No-one listened. Look where nationalism leads
There will be no unity in Scotland on 8th May, just taunts from either side, bitterness &amp; division. Look where nationalism leads #GE2015
Nothing is written. No-one has won yet. So campaign hard, persuade all you can. Be optimistic. Go out an win #GE2015 #SNPout
@debatescotland @Tigers2iron No
@UnionistLeague I see no lie that I have told in this tweet. Please enlighten
@jimfraser I'm not a member of any party and no-one has asked anyway
@thepoweredge I agree. I am Scottish. I love Scotland. But I follow through the logic of wanting the UK to endure
@TheWatcherTHFC I liked that one too. Really funny
.@Tigers2iron Good people have to start distancing themselves from those who are destroying the Scotland we all love
Thanks for all the support and RTs today folks. We have to stick together like everyone who cares about the UK must stick together #SNPout
Cybernats are not a fringe minority. Some of them are SNP candidates. They form the heart if not the head of the SNP campaign #SNPout #GE15
The SNP is now a mystic cult wholly divorced from reality 
@CJuliaSM We all have our different styles. Yours too can be very effective
There's no GE election result yet. There are days to go. Fight hard for every vote &amp; for every seat. It's as important as indyref #SNPout
We need to show that we're better than the Nats. Always respond to anger &amp; insult with politeness. Respond to rants with reason #SNPout
Brendan O'Hara is clearly not someone who should be representing anyone at Westminster. Time Sturgeon too action

I've faced much worse in my life than some men on computers shouting abuse from the safety of their own homes. You have no idea. #SNPout
In trying to shut down opponents the Nats of course are trying to shut down democracy in Scotland. Sorry but I keep campaigning #SNPout
There have recently been orchestrated mass attacks by Nats. It means my timeline is full of spam. I therefore may not see your comment.
Fact that one in seven Scots will vote tactically against SNP is a credit to #SNPout team. Lets make it even more 
My timeline is becoming a place where Angels fear to tread. Many apologies if I don't see your comment. SNP don't seem to want to fight fair
This article is why #SNP attack &amp; abuse me. You defend me by RTs &amp; shares. Help me get message across 
.@stuart_stumcg I've just had enough of the bullying. I'm perfectly aware of what nationalists have to say. I can read #SNPout #GE2015
Scotland is becoming a land of cowardly bullies who want to shout down opponents who disagree. I hardly recognise the place #SNPout #GE2015
@Bruced872 @robertos0511 I suspect they are more reasonable, which means they can work together
I never ever contact nationalists first. I am completely uninterested in what you have to say. Please repay the courtesy #SNPout #GE2015
Dear nationalists even if you are reasonable, please don't contact me I don't actually trust any of you anymore. Happy #SNPout #GE2015
.@GaryMcMeekin You think the abuse I've been getting is funny, which makes you complicit in it. Happy not to see you again
.@flashgrim It's the unwillingness to think of creative ways to protect our country that is putting it at risk #GE2015 #SNPout
.@NationsEnd You obviously sympathise with this tactic. It amounts to making my time line unreadable. Had enough of you. Bye
.@timmokx In every democracy some people are outvoted. In Britain Pro UK MPs outnumber anti UK MPs. That is how democracy works #GE2015
.@robertos0511 Grand coalition has not broke apart Germany. In what respect do we differ? How would you set about legally breaking us up?
Last night there was what amounted to a denial of service attack with mass Nats tweeting exactly the same nonsense. Are no tactics too low?
.@ChristainWright It doesn't disenfranchise anyone. Would love to know how you define the Scottish people. In what respect do we differ?
@DonWillieMiller I'm in favour of self-determination of peoples. Would love to see Tibetans given the choice that we had
.@timmokx I would back a grand coalition 100%. Solves all our problems
.@roadandthemiles That's because you are in Dundee
@colspn It doesn't relate to USSR at all
.@Singapom But what's the alternative going back to Michael Foot, Jim Callaghan. Is that what progressive means now? #SNPout #GE2015
.@ianbrannan1 You don't know me. You don't know what I was in favour of &amp; what I fought against. Very very offensive statement from you
.@ianbrannan1 So don't follow the example of countries that destroy themselves with nationalism
.@kirov221  You all seem to have come up with an even creepier tactic than usual. Let's flood my in box with the same abuse #SNPout #GE2015
SNP abuse is clearly turn on and turn offable. But who has the switch? Would love to know

.@linda8h I block anyone who like stalkers
.@jimfraser I worry about Cons &amp; Labs making a short term deal with Nats. Where are the statesmen showing a way forward for UK unity? #GE15
.@OMalefic Now there's some sort of repetition thing going on. Let's all abuse Effie together. Makes you look good doesn't it #SNPout #GE15
.@dke43708 Yet more abuse from the Nats. Did someone turn the switch on again. Why don't they come ready blocked #GE2015 #SNPout
In the next few weeks we're going to need people from Scotland, Wales, England &amp; NI to stand up for our country &amp; bring it unity #GE2015
.@debatescotland All comments are published automatically, but Blogger can be a bit flaky. Advise writing on Word then copy &amp; paste
.@jimfraser We need all Pro UK parties Left Right &amp; Centre to counter the threat to our country &amp; then act accordingly #GE2015 #SNPout
.@debatescotland Abuse doesn't taint me. It doesn't touch me. But it tells me all I need to know about those who send it. #SNPout #GE2015
There's a tiny minority who want to break up the UK compared to a vast majority that wants our country united. We win. We will always win
Nats want us to be pessimistic. Don't play their game. Fight for every vote, but also plan for how how UK will work together to thwart them
Nats are calling the result very early &amp; already gloating. They might be right, but then again they thought they'd won last time #GE2015
Look what happens when you elect populists who think we should live beyond our means 
If your looking for a positive alternative to the #SNP vision, here it is. Our story is better than theirs 
@Dark_Blitz_2 Seems quite a lot this late in the day
I tweet &amp; RT a lot. People get tired, they make mistakes, they don't read everything carefully. I do too. So do you. 
Speculating about polls folks is completely uninteresting. We learned last September they are inaccurate. We'll find out soon enough #SNPout
.@DonnyMurray That could well be true. I've ceased being interested in polls since last September. We'll find out soon enough
@smoothgroover Is this the Spanish inquisition or something. Sorry I don't play that game.
@keitheadams Thanks Keith I think it makes them look bad though so in the end it's counterproductive
.@JennieMacfie I make an argument about attacking assumptions at their root &amp; pun on weedkiller. Why be so literal? #SNPout #GE2015
.@JennieMacfie No-one is talking about killing but you. Identifying a party with a people is dangerous. It make me an enemy of the people
.@englishmanshome So long as everyone who cares about the UK sticks together we can see off this lot. We've seen off much worse #GE2015
Don't be despondent about polls. Rather use them as inspiration to campaign harder. We need every vote to keep  #SNPout #GE2015
UK needs a contingency plan. It's easy to block the SNP no matter how many are elected.   
.@stuart_w64 Strike me this admission of SNP intention rather precludes them from having any influence at Westminster #GE2015 #SNPout
@tonyveitchuk No I don't think so. Just a supporter
.@jimmyczz I think rather less are listening to you Jim. I'll keep campaigning for what I believe, you do the same.
@tonyveitchuk Someone called Alpen Goo and Broth, which loosely translates as Scotland forever
How do you have a rational debate with people who want to vote for an SNP candidate whose goal is to wreck the UK economy? #SNPout #GE2015
.@EKDon1983 Something is not less wrong because something else is also wrong. Don't  relativise. All abuse is wrong. It must stop.
.@alexgallagher2 I don't think they care so long as we become independent. It's no longer a reasoned debate about what's best for Scotland
No wonder 63% of didn’t say Yes!
#Snpo…
.@stuart_stumcg Have you seen the abuse I've been getting simply for disagreeing with the SNP. It's quite frightening sometimes #SNPout
Has it come to this Scotland? A place where it's unsafe to disagree with the SNP in a pub #SNPout #GE2015 
.@stuart_stumcg You don't talk about politics to people in Scotland you don't know are on your side. It's not safe. No one does
.@debatescotland I've blocked everyone who thinks reasoning amounts to personal insult. Doesn't leave many of you #SNPout #GE2015
@IanColquhounMA I like it very much too both the book and the film with Gary Cooper
.@stuart_stumcg On the morning after indyref not one of the people I meet at the bus stop mentioned it. We are all flocking together.
SNP have Beau Geste strategy, putting dead bodies in battlements to appear more than they are. They'll do much worse than they think #GE15
I hardly know anyone who is voting SNP. I find it hard to believe that more half the people I meet will. Who's been stacking the polls?
On the day of after the referendum I commiserated with opponents &amp; told my side not to taunt. Nats want to get their taunts in early #GE2015
.@RichardLucas3 Term "hun" is considered sectarian. I don't support any football team. Taunting is in very bad taste

@timmokx I quite agree that it's not all about sums. But it is in part
Salmond thinks economics is not about dismal sums. Imagine him having influence over the UK economy #GE2015 #SNPout 
@frugezze Disapproving of sectarianism on both hardly puts me back in the USSR
.@eddietruman Mr Moir quoted the Borg, suggesting he quote the Daleks is more humour than insult I would have thought.
So #GE2015 is not a rerun of indyref. That's what SNP want you to believe, but it's not what they say #SNPout 
.@ImJaneHope We need to heal the division in Scotland. We can't do so if there is a neverendum. This did huge damage to Quebec for decades
Can you imagine what would have happened if Alistair Darling need to ask Alex Salmond's permission to rescue the UK economy? #GE2015 #SNPout
Imagine a financial crisis like 2008 with a government needing to ask the SNP for permission to do what is necessary #GE2015 #SNPout
#Grexit looks likely as Riga talks fail. We need a sensible UK govt that does not depend on SNP 
.@RobertThe_Fox I am polite and measured in my language, even when provoked by massive abuse from my opponents. #SNPout #GE2015
.@RobertThe_Fox Eh politics is about trying to influence people. It's usually called campaigning
If there's to be a coalition govt. We're better off with the Lib Dems in it than any of the alternatives 
@timmokx  I think it's an interesting debate. On the whole I'm pro, but there are interesting arguments on both sides of the debate
.@TraffordLj @Hamish_Moir Instead we buried him
.@Hamish_Moir It's you that has been quoting the Borg not me. Perhaps you should start quoting the Daleks #SNPout #GE2015
.@figurewizard If you have friendly intentions towards other parts of the UK why do all your candidates make threats about what you'll do
@AlineDobbie @DPJHodges I do. Don't always agree, but usually thought provoking
.@RobertThe_Fox I agree that's why I'm in favour of bringing down borders as opposed to erecting new ones. UK is all about working together
SNP candidates threaten to deliver 'Westminster's worst nightmare'  
.@Hamish_Moir  We are the Borg you will be assimilated into the National Collective.  "Мы вас похороним"   
I watched Yangtse Incident (1957) again today. Then the White Ensign was torn but our country had unity

.@Goose74  We must fight together for this love of being a Brit. It's what unites us. We must make people in the UK deeply about our country
.@LawnmowerThomas I'm indifferent to party politics when UK is threatened. In wartime coalition we needed all of us to defeat a common foe
.@ShabbierChic UK is my country I have no other. "Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders."
.@thommok I try to fight with reason &amp; politeness. I try to respect opponents who are polite back. What else is there in a democracy #GE2015
.@ShabbierChic Taking a break. We can get on, but not if there is a continual attempt to break up our country #SNPout #GE2015
.@HJacksonajh People south of border must put pressure on Lab &amp; Cons not to work with the SNP &amp; work for unity in UK. Let's unite #GE2015
.@LawnmowerThomas Don't be foolish. The SNP are trying to destroy our country. Labour has always defended UK in time of need. #GE2015
@LaizyDaizey It will make a difference. That's all any of us can do. Try to change even one voter's mind. Maybe you change the world
.@bentcoppper I think if the people of Rotherham had local power they could solve all of their problems. Good people always outnumber bad
We've a fight on our hands. But it involves everyone in the UK who cares about our country. That's what #SNPout is really about #GE2016
.@dj_gor Quite so. When a battle end the defeated side has to accept defeat. This didn't happen in Scotland. Hence we keep fighting
@Goose74 That's good to know. Spread the word. I was dismayed by how many wanted to vote for Nicola
.@ShabbierChic Both sides are still fighting the battle that should have ended last September. That's why there's no peace in Scotland
.@ShabbierChic Why should people who support the UK work with those who don't #SNPout #GE2015
.@LaizyDaizey 17% voting tactically in Scotland has much to do with @SNPOut + volunteers. Deserve massive credit. I just help out #SNPout
.@HJacksonajh People in England need to wake up about the SNP. Just check my timeline to see what many of them are like #SNPout #GE2015
Whether or not SNP have any influence at Westminster we need to keep their numbers down as much as possible #SNPout 
@SidSockhead I hope no one does a deal. I've heard worrying stories Cameron giving FFA in exchange for EVEL. We'll find out soon enough
@BigJohnTheRed Unfortunately there is sectarian support for both sides of the argument. Wish that wasn't the case, but it is
@SidSockhead Politicians break their promises frequently so mistrust is in order. I hope they don't, but nothing would surprise me
SNP are not going to have any influence at Westminster no matter how many are elected 
@Tufty1903 Thanks for the heads up. Much appreciated
.@BigJohnTheRed That's some West of Scotland sectarian thing. Got nothing to do with me. I'm fae Aberdeen
@YorkshireFirst In the end it's up to people in England to decide. But I hope everyone get = devolution right across the UK
.@GLASNOSTORGUK Countries like USA &amp; Germany have lots of devolution but it's equal everywhere. That's what keeps them united #GE2015
.@YorkshireFirst What I want to see is fair devolution across the UK. I don't want a power that people in Yorkshire or Hampshire don't have
.@whiteroseyorks The key is to always use reason and always remain polite. It makes the abusers look foolish #SNPout #GE2015
.@YorkshireFirst I'd have nothing against devolving power to a level where Yorkshire has power, but even better if Ilkley has power
@CJuliaSM @melindiscott "Progressive" means things I agree with
.@plumsteadtom I've come across quite a few SNP supporters who like to quote Irish Gaelic Tiocfaidh ár lá [our day will come] #GE2015
@fitzybhoy67 Sure it does lots of people hate Britain. I hear it all the time. Some of them do because of past wars, troubles etc
@fitzybhoy67 I don't understand sectarianism, but some people hate Britain for sectarian reasons
This man smiles just like Nicola, but his message strikes me as a touch threatening #SNPout #GE2015 
This man's sign apparently means Kiss my behind. That's his message to Westminster #SNPout #GE2015 
In order to be a member of the SNP it is necessary to use foul language as much as possible #SNPout #GE2015 
It's hard to imagine the party this lady supports making a postive contribution to Westmonster #GE2015 #SNPout 
I always find the "Tick Tock" slogan rather creepy and threatening. But at the least the Nats are giving fair warning 
This man wants to warn English people that he is coming. Might be a good idea to listen to him #GE2015 #SNPout 
Did Nicola say Brace yourself we are coming in any of her debates. That's the message behind her smile however #GE15 
Is this the face of friendly liberal Scottish civic nationalism. He wants to rule over you #SNPout #GE2015 
Did Nicola tell her new found English friends that there's a storm coming from the North. Not very friendly #GE2015 
Some really positive messages from the SNP "Civic nationalists" in George Square Glasgow 
@fitzybhoy67 If you are too blind to see I don't think there would be much point me pointing it out
.@TynesideCelt Yet more disgusting abuse from the nationalists, who appear completely unable to argue #SNPout #GE2015
@benjaminsinger We'd solve a lot of problems if there were no marches on both sides of the sectarian divide. All equally unhelpful
@benjaminsinger I've never even seen an Orange order march. I live near Aberdeen. Hate all sectarianism. Wish no one would march
.@ianbrannan1 I have yet to meet a No campaigner who says they hate Scotland. That would amount to self-hatred #SNPout #GE2015
.@GaryMcMeekin @RossFootball This was yesterday 
.@benjaminsinger @Historywoman @SeanGChappelleM This looks fairly dubious don't you think 
@tonyveitchuk It's very hard to imitate someone else's system, even if it works well. It evolved from their history not ours
.@mahmooa1 All I want is that everyone in the UK gets the same amount of devolved power. It's called being fair to everyone
.@tonyveitchuk I rather like the Swiss model of government. Very local, very democratic. The country is highly successful &amp; united
.@murraytennisfan I'm voting for Christine Jardine in Gordon. I also voted for her predecessor. How do you presume to know which way I vote?
@RossFootball Agreed. I can't abide sectarianism on whatever side. It does huge harm
.@Mulder1981 If every town &amp; village had control over local matters, we'd have no need for national parliaments. They'd have nothign to do
.@RossFootball Too many people are voting SNP because they hate Britain because of Irish politics &amp; for sectarian reasons. See it frequently
.@badgersarefun I hadn't seen story before. Seems harmless. It's even positive about Nicola. I'm sure that's why it was told. Aren't you?
.@badgersarefun I think if you have a little hunt you could find the article easily. I've had enough hordes being sent my way for one week
Ed Miliband: No deal of 'any kind' with SNP 
@malcolmcameron7 Predicting the outcome of the election is like predicting the Grand national. Polls are all over the place. Who know
@G4rve I am certainly rethinking FPTP. It works fine with 2 parties, but it becomes a lottery when there are 5 or 6
@malcolmcameron7 This would destroy Labour in Scotland in the other parts of the UK.
@G4rve No one has tried equal devolution with local power like in Germany or the US. Perhaps no-one will. But I wish they would
@G4rve You make a reasoned case for both SNP &amp; independence. It makes for a pleasant debate.
.@TeuchterLoon I don't think that's possible TL. But we could bypass devolved parliaments giving power to towns &amp; villages #SNPout #GE2015
.@SarahBlackIsle I don't think we have to be neat, but we do have to be fair. Lop-sided devolution is destroying the UK #GE2015 #SNPout
.@highlandedward2 I sympathise with that argument, but I think they would use power and influence to wreck UK. #SNPout #GE2015
.@sueryanjaques I never get counterargument from any of you. Just argumentum ad hominem
.@GaryTheDandy87 Strike me the UK in past year has been more under threat than at any time in past 300 years. Not irrational. Obviously true
.@frugezze That sounds very like "Man is the measure of all things" which is the essence of sophistry

@G4rve Ulster Unionists propped up Major as I recall. So I don't think that's a problem. Issue is legitimacy but  very subjective concept
.@TynesideCelt @ianssmart More abuse from the Nats. Are you actually able to make coherent arguments. Why not try it some time #SNPout
We need to start again &amp; give ever person in the UK the same degree of devolved power. Equal local power solves West Lothian #GE2015 #SNP0ut
Nats control health &amp; education etc in Scotland. They cannot expect to rule devolved issues in an England which has no devolution #GE2015
SNP cannot expect to control issues in England which they control in Scotland. It's fundamentally undemocratic #SNPout #GE2015
Rational discussion with SNP becoming impossible as we share different worlds with different truths 
@G4rve I think the issue is if a party that loses the election is propped up by PC, DUP etc I as you know favour a grand coalition
.@StefWilliams6 I argued for reconciliation after indyref but all I got were people who wanted to continue fighting the battle.
.@ImJaneHope If Nicola said we will not seek another referendum for a generation, we could all make peace. This is what I seek.
No-one must make any sort of deal with the SNP. It would be undemocratic in to do so 
@stuart_stumcg  I have been abused in the most disgraceful way this week. Perhaps you haven't seen. Very grateful to people who lend support
@integritypfft Thanks that's a very good song. Enjoyed it a lot
@gmclarksonz Everything is opinion. I write opinions backed by argument and reason. Politics is not science where we do experiments
@RossFootball  There are differences, but there are also similarities
.@StefWilliams6 If SNP had accepted result of indyref &amp; ruled out another for a generation we would have had a chance to heal wounds #SNPout
@GeorgeFoulkes Thank you George. That means a great deal.
.@colspn If reasonable SNP supporters did more to control the unreasonable, life would be more pleasant for all of us. I condemn all abuse
.@shewanlpool I wish the Nats came already blocked. I can count on the fingers of one hand the one's that are reasonable #SNPout
.@stuart_stumcg  I am incredulous at the level of abuse I get in Scotland for putting forward reasoned argument. I can't quite believe it
@Architect2025UK Sounds good to me. Happy to receive any help
.@IFeiras What do you think the purpose of political discussion is if it's not persuasion?
My blog passed a very big number of visitors indeed today. I'm very grateful to everyone who takes the time to read

.@nmdornoch I have stated many times my real name is Effie Deans. You are complicit in this by your speculation. 
@gmclarksonz I have no proof just opinion. I think I shared one of my blogs with you about the subject

T…
.@PDevlin1 SNP supporters I come across online frequently strike me as very sectarian indeed. As does waving Irish flags at an Nat rally
.@gmclarksonz Civic nationalism logically collapses very quickly. There is nothing inclusive about any form of nationalism #SNPout
.@gmclarksonz My blog says nothing of the sort. It says you should read all sorts of different newspapers &amp; then think for yourself #'SNPout
.@Paula1902 I am one blogger. I don't think I have the power to divide Scotland.
.@highconstable Nationalism frequently destroys the thing that it says it loves. I've seen what it did to Ukraine. Divided now forever
.@RossFootball I want everyone to think for themselves. Don't assume. Read lots of different newspapers. Too many Nats just repeat what told
.@CrowtherJohn I have a brain and I have been taught to reason. There is a thing called inference. I oppose the SNP hence the abuse #SNPout
@KHunter17  Men parading with Irish flags I don't know enough about it to identify them but it looked a bit dubious
@OnABluePlanet That's the one. I find it all rather shocking to be honest
@NatBuster I wouldn't use word identify. I live quite openly
What I regret most deeply is the way the SNP have divided Scotland  
Apparently some SNP fans have done some sort of mocked up photo of me. Haven't seen it. Usual misogynistic stuff no doubt #SNPout
I've seen a video of men parading in Glasgow with Irish flags. No idea who they are, but please keep this stuff out of Scottish politics
.@gmclarksonz SNP are civic nationalists. But logic of civic nationalism is not to be a one at all

.@CrowtherJohn I have been getting epic amounts of disgusting abuse from nationalist men all week. Do you approve? 
@Architect2025UK Happy to hear it
.@Jhimbo I haven't seen any pics. Not very interested in what new ways you all dream up to abuse women. Proud of yourself? #SNPout
@frugezze That sort of thing is clearly silly. I regret it perhaps more than you do
.@Del_ivered Always criticise the argument. Never criticise person who holds it. It's not personal. You can be friends &amp; disagree #SNPout
.@Crofter100 Your response shows that you are fully in sympathy with the foul mouthed abuser. Your name is quite apt #SNPout
.@thehairycaber  Every view is personal, but mine are backed with reason and argument. The trick is to find counterarguments #SNPout #GE15
.@RossCaldwell That's very kind of you to say. Thank you. I appreciate it.
.@ongehoorzaam31 More abuse from the nationalists rather than reasoned argument. Keep on coming I keep on blocking #SNPout
.@Dumbiedikes1 People getting beaten up for not being nationalists. Saying the wrong thing in the wrong place. Look where nationalism leads
.@TheQuietNo  Worrying so many Scots get all of their information from one source. Like buying multiple copies of the same newspaper #SNPout
.@YesTroon  I would you like to be impersonated on twitter. It'd very creepy indeed. Why not fight fair. Use reasoned argument #SNPout #GE15
.@justabhoy1 How would you feel if your wife, mother or daughter received abuse like this from a man? #SNPout 

Great line on Nat thinking from @Effiedeans


.@stevelonie @ndls61 Why does someone who I've blocked &amp; who has blocked me continue to abuse &amp; harass It's called stalking Andy #SNPout
@ronague If you mean like Germany or USA I would not be opposed. They have lots of devolved power but also strong central govt. Need both
.@dmck52 There are lots of ways to make devolution fair. But above all it must not divide us still further. We also need ways to unite #GE15
@kevverage @Daily_Record Well done Kevin. Excellent article

.@ancamartin If it were up to me we devolve beyond "national" parliaments. That actually solves the West Lothian question #SNPout
@IainInkster You can dig around my time line if you're interested. I'd prefer to leave it at that
Something ludicrous about people in England wanting to vote for the SNP. It's like turkeys wanting to vote for Christmas #SNPout #GE2015
@pinkandtweed Ludicrous conspiracy theories going around. Truth very simple. Woman has unpronounceable Russian name uses maiden name too
@Browser01 @scotbot Both Scotbot and Andy Ellis been involved in abusing me. You seem to be sticking up for them &amp; the others #SNPout
Creepiest thing of all is when someone appears reasonable on twitter &amp; then I find them using what I say in the vilest way possible #SNPout
By implication SNP supporters are searching for where I live, where I work. To do what. Abuse me in person? Disgusting behavior #SNPout
What I find creepy is that Nats are so sure that there is no-one in Aberdeenshire called Effie Deans. There is. But how do you know? #SNPout
@mhairigrealis Thanks I will
.@Browser01 @scotbot Mr scotbot called me an extremist and now calls me a sock puppet. Which leads to this 
@mhairigrealis Not in great detail. I like idea of devolving to city or town level. Good idea to have a conference about it. We must be fair
.@mhairigrealis I'm fairly apolitical. I think both main parties have made a mess of devolution. It's totally unequal. It must be made fair
.@scotbot Just more personal abuse from someone who loves to troll me. Unable to even express a view that doesn't include an insult in it
The way to bring about fair devolution in the UK is if every town or even village has exactly the same level of devolved power #SNPout #GE15
.@mhairigrealis I agree. We need fair devolution across UK, but it must be done in such a way that it unites us not divides us.
Clegg dismisses coalition deal with Lab involving SNP 
We need Lib Lab &amp; Con to start thinking in terms of Britain &amp; how to make us united again  
@mhairigrealis Sensible people left &amp; right have been pro or anti EU. But the debate has been hijacked by UKIP who do it much harm
.@Del_ivered We must all see the beam in our own eye in order think clearly. Question all assumptions, not just those of others
.@mhairigrealis I find Lib Lab Con people usually to be polite &amp; critical of their own parties. Each has faults. We need a reasoned debate
@mhairigrealis I haven't no doubt more filth from the Nats. Oh well. They are quite creative in finding new ways to abuse
.@Historywoman I worry about closed mindedness in general. So many people just toe the party line in academia. Makes things very dull
@Marx_ist @KHunter17 Of course.
.@PDevlin1 I'm not assuming anything. I am arguing &amp; drawing conclusions from reason &amp; experience. Why not point out the flaw in my logic
@Kilkito We all have minds which allow us to judge critically. I am uninterested in spin and can see through it. So can you
@chrism325 That's fine. I enjoy calm reasoned debate. I know many SNP supporters who enjoy it too. Makes for a better Scotland
.@Marx_ist As I say in the blog I was attacked in foulest way possible for questioning the assumptions of SNP supporters. Few used reason
.@Historywoman I think the UK press has huge numbers of great columnists putting all sorts of perspectives including the SNP one.
.@Kilkito Do you seriously think all British newspapers except the Nat are lying. There is perspective of course but there is truth too
@chrism325 That seems unjust. You have been polite. Happy to debate. Just very tired at the moment
.@MajorDMalpas Thank you David. If we can all question our own assumptions &amp; think for ourselves we won't be misled by tiny pot bullies
.@posleadership It's only by questioning assumptions and thinking for ourselves that we remain free to do so. I fear closed minds #SNPout
.@thegandydancer Thanks We must guard truth. And we can only do so if we're willing to question assumptions. Closed mindedness is dangerous
.@malcolmcameron7 I've faced much worse than this lot. They try to scare &amp; intimidate, but it just shows them up for what they are #SNPout
We no longer even share truth in Scotland 
.@fleshofmyflesh I deplore personal abuse against Mr Salmond, but it's hardly the same thing. I not a politician, just an ordinary voter
@derekbmcneil @coollist Thanks Derek. More in less than an hour
.@alanthegasman I see people attacking the SNP &amp; sometimes using words I dislike. I don't know any SNP supporter who gets abuse like I do
.@TraffordLj I'm finding most of the Nats I interact with incapable of writing a sentence without a personal insult in it #SNPout #GE2015
.@coollist My blog is read by thousands every week. I get to see the statistics. I'm approaching a very big number indeed #SNPout
.@pedrosp4 You seem to be trying to justify the abuse I have been receiving as well as contributing to #SNPout 
It's been quite a week. There's a reason they attack &amp; abuse. I use reason to undermine SNP assumptions

I can't promise you the fireworks of last week. But there's a new blog tomorrow. I won't be silenced no matter what they shout #SNPout
.@StopTurbines This is by the best journalist in Scotland saying Cons would trade EVEL for FFA = indy later

.@chaestrachan There's secret ballot. Votes as you please. But don't vote to break up my country if you don't want to break up your own
.@chaestrachan Would your partner want to see Mexico break up? Your family see Italy break up? Can you not see the hypocrisy?
@BlueEyedSoulMan I think I should change my name to Eddie. Maybe the Nats couldn't find me then
.@garyth123 It's been a very tough week Gary. With abuse levels that you would not believe. A little sympathy perhaps 
.@RebeccaMacallen  You people always call the result before it's even been counted. Met disappointment last time #SNPout
@Shairpie No. I worry much more about nationalism. I've seen the damage it can do. That's why I campaign so hard
New rules. Happy to discuss nicely folks. But if your comment includes anything remotely insulting you get an immediate block #SNPout
#Grexit shortly. UK government must not be held to ransom by the Scottish Syriza. 

.@robertos0511 I haven't had an argument all week. Just men shouting and swearing at me. You appear to condone it
.@0ctavia I provided an argument. You provided still more nationalist insults. Last time
.@TrueWales There has to be something on which you base the distinction. That's why civic nationalism collapses or becomes something else
@StopTurbines We think first priority is to get as few SNP Mps as possible. We hope neither Cons nor Lab do deal with Nats. No need to
.@b12snp @0ctavia @traquir More abuse from the Nats who prefer insult to argumnent
.@0ctavia Civic nationalism collapses very quickly I'm afraid as a matter of logic. I've written about it many times

.@sarumanesan Being negative does not mean trolling. Just more insults and misinterpretation. Last time
.@YesRattray More abuse from the nationalists. Had quite a bit of it this week
.@DZDeathray Logic of civic nationalism is to cease to be a nationalist 
Nicola thinks her gut will tell her when to have 2nd indyref. Vote tactically &amp; give her stomach ache 
.@malcolmcameron7 Sometimes their attempts to be welcoming end up being very creepy indeed
@Shairpie Everyone with a vote is enfranchised. That's what the word means. I lived in USSR socialism doesn't work
.@IndyForEvil Indy for Evil is the most positive message I've seen all day. I wouldn't call it evil. But I would say it's mistaken #SNPout
.@0ctavia I'm Scottish my husband is Russian. Who are you to say I'm welcome here? I was born here.
Remember how the Nats were miles behind last summer. Did they give up? No they fought hard &amp; might have won. We must fight like that #SNPout
I'm hearing far too much negativity from our side. This is helping the Nats. Be positive &amp; fight for every seat #SNPout #GE2015
#SNPout h…
@logicsrock @0ctavia @traquir @b12snp More personal abuse from the Nats That gets blocked
We have chance to do something extraordinary like last Sept. We can turn things around by word of mouth &amp; the wheel 
@0ctavia Yes
Postal votes have already gone out. Sorry if you are disappointed but this is the final wheel. #SNPout 
Nats are desperately trying to spread confusion about tactical voting. They know #SNPout is a threat. Don't help them 
@stephenob21002 Now do you see how you're helping the SNP. They love to see us dispute the message
It matters very little to me which colour of Pro UK MP wins in which seat. It's for that reason I vote tactically #SNPout
Tactical voting is about getting as many Pro UK MPs as possible. Don't squabble about the wheel #SNPout 
@AGMcKillop Best to try to reverse the trend I think. Still time to campaign and persuade. Anyway I always keep trying
@stephenob21002 We have enough trouble putting across a clear message. Disputing it just helps the Nats.
.@cm_mid The number of seats SNP wins depends entirely on how many of us vote tactically. 3 parties will nearly always outnumber 1 #SNPout
@AGMcKillop As I recall Yes was leading with two weeks to go. I haven't believed a poll since
There's going to be some wailing  &amp; gnashing of teeth if Nats don't get to run whole UK. But then they're used to disappointment #GE2015
@stephenob21002 You're welcome to vote for your own candidate if you wish. Everyone is, but it's not a tactical vote. Don't split us
.@wendybea @traquir @stephenkidd56 More unpleasant abuse from the Nats. Now they want to kick me out of the country. Goodbye
Remember last summer how the Nats continually talked up their chances. Just ignore them. They're going to do much worse than they think.
Nats are using sneaky underhand tactics. With false tactical voting wheels, impersonations etc Shows they're worried 
I'm hearing very good things about Christine Jardine's chance of beating Salmond. Here's why I voted for her

.@thegandydancer  I've had to deal with some genuinely scary people in my life. The Nats aren't scary at all actually
.@findodger More insult instead of counterargument. You people struggle writing a sentence without playing the man rather than the ball
In Aberdeen last Sept I only saw Yes posters only saw Nats campaigning. We do our work more quietly. Don't worry but fight for every seat
Nats showed in Sept that they were peak-too-sooners. #PeakSNP is already past. They are going to do much worse than they think #SNPout
.@findodger I have well over 120 arguments. But you're not even aware of them

If you dislike my arguments come up with better counterarguments. But instead the Nats stalk, harass, intimidate insult &amp; abuse. #SNPout
Imagine if I went around attacking the jobs of SNP supporters. It would be an absolute disgrace. Yet they routinely do this to me #SNPout
@Historywoman @McGillveray I do too. First insult and they are gone. But I sometime point them out
Attacking my work because you don't like my politics is as low as you can go Imagine if someone did it to you

@DavidHeadViews I've face much worse than this lot in my life. It doesn't even touch me
.@stephenmcw More personal abuse rather than counterargument from a Nat. Do you people not even know how to argue
A Dr Writes: For a case of “Premature Nat-elation” you can seek treatment. Best to avoid anger and …
.@McGillveray More personal insult from Nats who can't find counterargument
.@thewinning55 Yes @SNP0ut is a fake. More sneaky underhand trickery from the Nats. I advise everyone to block @SNP0ut
@DaveRRobertson  That's OK. We think the wheel is the best way forward for tactical voting. No-one knows as we haven't had the GE yet
"We'll really shake them up" when we run Westminster cries Nicola's army, but #PeakSNP has already passed &amp; they'll not run anything #SNPout
In every sport it's crucial not to peak too soon. Crucial not to boast about winning before you have. #PeakSNP is behind us. Now for #SNPout
The Nat tide is going out #PeakSNP was reached some time ago. Stop cries Queen Nicola, but the tide isn't listening #SNPout #GE2015
@TheWhiteSpyder @DaveRRobertson I agree. Tactical voters must cease thinking about my party think only about #SNPout
@TheWhiteSpyder @DaveRRobertson  If we squabble among ourselves it only helps the Nats. Follow the wheel 
SNP are the hare in the race. Overconfident. We quietly *without fuss spread  word. It might not be glamourous being a tortoise. But it wins
The trouble with the SNP is that they always peak too soon. We reached #PeakSNP some time ago, watch as the trough follows #SNPout
.@alanthegasman I have pretty thick skin, but it gets dispiriting sometimes facing walls of abuse. But someone turned it off last night
Just like last September I have a feeling that we've reached #PeakSNP they're on their way down from now on. Keep it up #SNPout is working
Being British is the glue holding UK together. It doesn't depend on where your parents come from. It unites 
IFS: SNP spending plans mean longest austerity  
Intrigues me that Nat abuse appears to be turn-on &amp; turn-offable. Does he or she who must be obeyed have a switch? #SNPout #GE2015
@gmclarksonz I don't think anyone is telling the truth about what is needed for UK to live within our means.
.@gonefishing1986  "There's only so much we can take" sounds profoundly undemocratic. People vote tactically in democracies all over world
.@chrism325 I am one person campaigning, putting a point of view. I wouldn't know how to control people's thoughts. Do you? #SNPout
.@BigJohnTheRed No. I dislike all personal abuse &amp; try my best to always be polite to opponents. Attack the idea not the person holding it
(Isnt that why we call then gnat…
Votes will win not polls, so every vote really counts.
 
.@Tyndale7 This is what nationalism does.It's independence at any price. I've seen this before. It's very dangerous #SNPout
.@CokieDee62 Yes. How else could I vote for Christine Jardine. Are you accusing me of electoral fraud? Let's find still more forms of abuse
No-one is willing to face up to the fact that we need to earn much more &amp; spend much less as a country. #GE2015 is intellectually a vacuum
@jimmywatsontmf No. I use my real name
.@FloraScarabello Too many people are abused in Scotland for expressing an opinion. Thanks for sticking up for us. Really appreciated.
@alexgallagher2 @BBCScot2015 @Margmsp @iainmacwhirter @johnmcternan Which gave rise to this 
@CrowtherJohn We disagree. But at at least we do it politely. Best wishes
@jimmywatsontmf I'm not an alter ego.
.@Fairysoprano Yet more abuse from the Nats. They really can't handle reason &amp; can't think of counterarguments #SNPout
Let's build up the mood like we did last Sept. Above all tell those who go nowhere near twitter. We need them to vote tactically #SNPout
There are over 120 reasons why Nats want to shut me up through insults &amp; intimidation. Guess what it's not working

.@liberatedloulou Neil Hay cybernat gets slap on the wrists, but he still gets to be a candidate. Perhaps the slap was with fingers crossed
Spot on Effie. The only democracy where 'no' doesn't mean no.
@CJuliaSM @iansireland Very good news. I'm quite fare away at the moment, so I'm sure Catherine knows better than me
.@ede90821192343f Huge numbers of people complaining about tactical voting, voted tactically against the Conservatives for years #SNPout
.@gwpurnell @fairynuff1979 @MrMalky More insults instead of reason &amp; counterargument from the Nats. Some quite creative #SNPout
@iansireland I'm hearing Christine has a chance. Both Salmond and Nicola were in Inverurie last weekend I hear so perhaps they're worried
@jimmywatsontmf You see it occasionally in Walter Scott if I recall correctly
I've just voted for Christine Jardine. Just one of the votes she needs to beat Salmond in Gordon. Let's take it one step at a time #GE2015
I made a joke this morning about Scottish women seceding to get away from the nationalist men. Nats don't have much of a sense of humour
.@wee_sacks The worse insult you can come up with is that someone is English. But you saw no such thread as I was born near Aberdeen
@Skillex2 I would not vote for them
Focus on what we can influence. Tactical voting &amp; getting our vote out. We need to spread the word like Sept #GE15 
Nationalism is making Scotland a desperately unpleasant place to live for many of us. Is independence worth wrecking Scotland? #SNpout
I am about as polite as it's possible to be on twitter. I write articles which use reason. All I get in reply is insults. Shame on you
Nats love to say that it's both sides that abuse. But it's overwhelmingly their side that abuses and shames Scotland #SNPout #GE2015
Nats hate having their assumptions questioned &amp; a foolproof plan that blocks them. Hence the abuse

.@davie_welsh This one's an SNP supporter. Be careful of this type. Very sneaky
Tactical voting is democratic. We've been doing it in Scotland for years. The reason the SNP hate it is it works 
@Skillex2 We're fighting to keep the UK intact. Frankly you are not helping.
@SallyVeraCoburn It is a dreadful moral argument to point out that something else is bad too. It serves to undermine the wrong
.@edoian1 More abuse from nationalist men. Now I'm a witch. That gets you blocked
@KHunter17 If you do a search on my timeline last night and this morning you will find the worst instance of abuse I've suffered in years.
@MurrayTCDouglas This one is bad too is a dreadful moral argument. Really shameful actually.
@martin_campbell Be careful not to relativise. That's bad but this too is bad is a really poor argument
I sometimes think it would be better for Scottish women if we seceded from Scottish men. Let them have their indy Scotland all to themselves
Argument &amp; counterargument is fine. But personal attack has no place in politics. Any insult whatsoever get an immediate block #SNPout
I now assume that anyone who attacks &amp; insults me personally on my timeline is in full agreement with last night's monstrosity #SNPout
It's really time for ordinary decent SNP supporters to put pressure on their party to disown those who bring shame on Scotland #GE2015
If SNP is the liberal, friendly welcoming organisation they portray themselves as why do they have supporters who abuse rather than reason
Perhaps its the misogyny &amp; sexist abuse used by Scottish nationalist men that makes their views so much less popular with women #SNPout
.@rtypehero More abuse from the nationalists. They prefer to respond with insult rather than reasoned argument

.@jhunter1875 So it's my fault that I get abuse. No doubt because I am provocative. Where have I heard this argument before? #SNPout #GE2015

@sarumanesan


@Effiedeans


You decide. #snp #snpout or…
I'm glad you rise above it.
Good people.
@TheWatcherTHFC They key is that no-one works with the SNP. I think English people are sensible enough to work that out for themselves
@BigJohnTheRed I agree, but there are also similarities
@DennisHammond @RuthDavidsonMSP I disagree with Ruth about some things, but I she's very good at sticking up for UK

Unionist, Royalist &amp;…
@TheWatcherTHFC I view it as Nats self destructing. I keep going off course, they don't like logical argument
@alexgallagher2 I hugely admire Mr Mcternan, but I've never even met him. MacWhirter's joke not at all funny
There's a reason I've been getting abuse. I use reason to undermine SNP assumptions 
@uncleporkie @johnmcternan I ignore abuse. Completely indifferent. But it never used to be like this in Scotland
@highconstable I all ready have. I take all abuse as a compliment
nats are increasingly nasty and vile   ((((hug))))
Not funny at all
.@iainmacwhirter This is what happens to ordinary people when you make jokes with cybernats. Not very funny is it? 
This constitutes a Ruth Davidson level of abuse. I remain polite but look at what these people tweet #SNPout 
Imagine if Salmond won by 1 vote because you a Lab or Con voter chose to back a candidate who can't win. Only Jardine can beat Salmond #GE15
@kevwodonnell That's fine. I used to feel exactly the same way. Tactical voting isn't for everyone, but it appeals to some
@SecretOil This is why I get frustrated when people squabble about which party we should back. In the end it doesn't matter which pro UK MP
@kevwodonnell @55_10_battalion Nobody's asking you too. You live in Glasgow. You should vote Labour
Without tactical voting Lab may win 5 seats, Cons 0 &amp; Lib 1. So don't let's squabble about the wheel. #SNPout #GE2015 
@jj_bruce I've been getting all sorts of abuse this week, but Nat is a new one. Still I suppose you mean it as compliment.
@kevwodonnell I think you'll find we are campaigning for Labour in all of Glasgow.
@Historywoman I wasn't involved in selection of wheel.  But I don't think we can change it with with 2 weeks to go
@mtfhayes There are places where it has been difficult to make a call. We've tried to be fair to everyone. We hope Lib Lab &amp; Con win
@SoleroLady Doing fine thanks
.@David_Wilson_80 No I'm not sure as we haven't had election yet. But parties rarely win a seat with more than 50% of vote
All day been getting people I've never seen before complaining about #SNPout wheel. Saying we should change it. I wonder if they are Nats
A lot of thought went into the #SNPout wheel. It's based on polling &amp; odds. Squabbling about it just helps the SNP 
@FrPip If you don't like tactical voting by all means choose party of your choice. But we are not changing now. Far too late in the day
.@Toytowner Opposing SNP is not anti-Scotland. Identifying a party with a people, makes me an enemy of the people. Is that what you think?
.@highconstable It's obvious in Edinburgh South that No voters must vote   for Ian Murray. They will feel very foolish if they don't #SNPout
Effie it is apathy they see no way forward, they no difference between any parties years of stagnant policie…
.@FrPip Tactical voting means picking party we judge to have the best chance. It's far too late to squabble over who that is. It helps SNP
@Mr_Grumble Doing fine thanks
In nearly every seat No voters will outnumber Nats. If we vote tactically we'll win, if we don't we'll all feel very foolish #SNPout #GE2015
Still unconvinced about tactical voting? Just look how the Nats hate it. Perhaps that will convince you to back #SNPout #GE2015
@mtfhayes I fully understand those who disagree with tactical voting. I had the same view for years. Good luck in your constituency
We've spend months developing #SNPout campaign. The only thing that jeopardises it is selfish No voters who care only about their own party
SNP voters hate #SNPout which is why they're complaining about us so much. They love those who disregard the wheel 
.@David_Cameron Only person who can stop Alex Salmond's boasting is Christine Jardine. All Lab &amp; Con in Gordon vote for her #SNPout #GE2015
@rabana45 As I said you don't understand the argument. Now go away
GB,GB,GB,GB,GB,GB,GB,GB,GB 
.@BalbirnieAngela I live in Gordon too. But I think you will find that Salmond has yet to win the seat. The election is on May 7th #GE2015
.@rabana45 Britain is independent. It is a common way of describing the UK which is independent. You clearly don't understand the argument
As I said recently Full Fiscal Autonomy #AusterityMax turns UK into  Eurozone. Do People in UK really want that? 
.@rabana45 @CJuliaSM I certainly do not. Don't misrepresent if you can't find a counterargument. Britain is another way of saying UK
Don't come to me with plans on how your party really should be voted for rather than one on the wheel. You are just splitting the No vote

.@harrietta3 By all means try to split the No vote, but you're only helping the Nats
The choices that No voters make in next few days will determine the result in Scotland. It's in our power to keep the #SNPout #GE2015
It's a waste of time trying to convince the true believers. Focus on #SNPout message &amp; making sure no-one cooperates with the Nats #GE2015
@wallaceimo For years I too was opposed to tactical voting. So I sympathise. It's not for everyone. Good luck in your constituency
It's really late in the day folks. Don't squabble amongst ourselves. Either follow the wheel or help the Nats #SNPout 
.@Calum59 Calm down, dear 

@marcus_buist Thanks for RT Marcus. Good luck in your constituency
.@marcus_buist Need to question SNP assumptions &amp; get message across to whole UK that no party must work with separatists. #SNPout #GE2015
@CJuliaSM  Word of mouth and RTs are the only way we have. But we are being read &amp; the message is getting across.
@NoreenHarding11 @CJuliaSM SNP are desperate that No voters squabble &amp; disagree rather than unite behind one candidate #SNPout
.@rabthecab Is it actually possible for a nationalist to write a sentence without including something insulting in it? I begin to wonder
.@sarumanesan Now you're arguing from authority or simply stating your position rather than putting counterarguments against mine
@markcstevens81 I am legion
@markcstevens81 Quite so. But that in no way implies that Scotland does not exist. Aberdeenshire exists
I was taught how to argue vigorously but politely. It amuses me that so many nationalists appear not to even know the basics of debate #GE15
.@markcstevens81 I explained that quite clearly in the blog that is bothering you all so much. Find a counterargument

There are cybernats &amp; there are those that have a facade of politeness but send the cybernats to taunt &amp; stalk. I'm not sure which is worse
@markcstevens81 Scotland exists. So does Aberdeenshire. The issue is not existence. Read more carefully
.@jruddy99 Not as far as I'm aware. I really bother the Nats. Even the more reasonable ones stick the boot in. I take it as compliment
SNP's biggest weakness is overconfidence. Our biggest strength is British self-deprecation, calm &amp; then quietly voting the Nats out #SNPout
@GeorgeFoulkes Thanks George. The thing is they prefer to abuse than come up with counterarguments. I take it as a sort of complement
@WilliamCroall1 @CJuliaSM Thanks William. Getting the message across is the crucial part.
Nats are going to do much worse than they think on the day. What will change it is No voters turning out like we did last September #GE2015
@AberdeenTories Our wheel says Con has best chance in West Aberdeenshire. Crucial we don't squabble &amp; split the vote 
@markcstevens81 Of course I think Scotland exists. Nothing I have written suggests that it doesn't
.@CJuliaSM I would say same thing where Cons or Labs have best chance to beat SNP. We all must put country before party #SNPout
Only thing that can stop Christine Jardine pulling off result of the night is Con &amp; Lab voters too foolish or selfish to back her #SNPout
@nesoron People need to study subjects where they need to think for themselves. Classics require serious study. Other subjects too I think

.@nanniebrown Very good effort on your part. We all must talk to friends, family &amp; colleagues. We can still turn this around. #SNPout GE2015
If every No voter voted tactically we could limit SNP to a few seats in Glasgow &amp; Dundee. Let's beat them #SNPout 
This isn't the Scotland that gave us Smith, Hume &amp; Scott, it's a Scotland that thinks Art is produced by a collective &amp; democracy by a mob
The ability to argue rationally &amp; calmly without personal insult is a sure sign of education, the inability a sure sign of its absence
The most interesting thought comes when you question assumptions, the thoughtless however remain uninteresting &amp; question nothing #SNPout
.@RabY1903 More Nat Men coming up with abuse instead of counterarguments. Even their journalists act this way now. Be careful Scotland #GE15
Really kind gesture from @Planet_Pedro who gives my latest a reblog. I recommend you visit his blog soon

.@thehairycaber  Unionist is true I was never a communist partly because some of my relations were sent to the Gulag by communists
.@thehairycaber I'll just add that to the list of things I've been called in last few days. Not many counterarguments though #SNPout #GE2015
There goes that nice Mr Darling sticking up for UK again.  He's a pretty good record of doing that 
More reasoned argument &amp; detailed figures from @kevverage The SNP would make you poorer

With one or two exceptions I begin to feel its actually unsafe to interact with Nats such is their aggression. Prepare to be ignored #SNPout
The creepiest thing of all is when Nats contact me &amp; appear friendly enough. But later I discover they are trying to stab me in the back
This is the argument that drives Nats Nuts. Here's what may not be said because they have no counterargument

.@itsagoinwrang In Scotland some arguments may not be made. Why not provide a counterargument rather than try to shut down debate #SNPout
.@Calum59 I have been insulted, sworn at and stalked by people with badges that say 45 or Yes. Fury is the only word to describe it #SNPout
@porridge_time I am responsible only for what I write. If you disagree with someone else take it up with them. I admire Mr Martin's writing
@Bravebelly2 I think my latest blog rather touched a nerve. They all seem to be blowing up these days
@jruddy99 @johnmcternan I respect Mr Mcternan and enjoy his writing but we have rather different styles I think
Shame when a journalist joins the cybernattery in personal insult rather than counterargument #GN2015 #SNPout 
@LapGongLeong It's too late. There is no common ground left. Deeply tragic situation. I've seen this before in Eastern Europe
.@LapGongLeong @Mr_D_Nicholson It's just more abuse from the Nats. That's what you get for putting forward rational argument in Scotland
.@kippaxstreet1 @iainmacwhirter @chrisdeerin It's just typical Nat behaviour. Play man rather than the ball. Why not find a counterargument?
,@LapGongLeong Not blaming any camp, just sad that nationalism has turned Scotland into Northern Ireland. Two tribes with little in common
.@iainmacwhirter @markrowantree @ndls61 Может ли Джон Мактернан говорить по-русски? #SNPout #GE15
@CJuliaSM I agree it's vital that people from all parties who support the UK work together for the good of our country.
.@sarumanesan I make my case at some length here. The SNP like you are assuming what you are trying to prove

@CJuliaSM Perhaps we could call it the #SNPout party. Tough to get new parties of the ground though. We'll see after GE
@ImJaneHope I think you miss the point of the tweet
It always amuses me when people with Yes or 45 badges protest so loudly that #GE2015 is not about independence #SNPout
Soon Scotland there will be 2 parties. 1 nationalist &amp; 1 unionist at that point we'll have some sort of power sharing if not worse #SNPout
Life in Russia toughens you up. People have no food, no foodbanks. Only friends &amp; family. Bring it on. I can take anything you throw at me
There are few places in the world with an average standard of living as high as in Scotland. Yet through folly we fight amongst ourselves
I'm a rather shy polite middle aged lady who tries to argue rationally. Far too many Scottish men think it's OK to shout abuse at women
Asserting an opinion is not an argument, nor is insulting person who makes it a counterargument. There's a paucity of thought in Natland
If bond markets don't think UK has credible deficit reduction plan they will charge us much more. The we really will have austerity #SNPout
Only important political issue at the moment is how UK lives within its means. SNP are not part of the solution they are part of the problem
Crucial that Lib Lab &amp; Con are economically credible. Anyone who works with SNP immediately loses that credibility perhaps for ever #GE15
.@mungler No. England is commonly called a country, but lacks defining characteristics of a country. It's a country like Fife is a kingdom
Ex Labour voters who think voting  SNP gets them a Labour government don't understand how politics works 
Angela Eagle: Labour would speak to other parties to get a Queen’s Speech through   
Don't believe the SNP's lies about wanting to help England  
Will they complain when others vote tactica…
.@WiseScot  I still think Nicola is deliberately scaring the horses in England so that they vote Tory. It may well work #SNPout #GE2015
@jimfraser I'm doing this virtually at moment. In my local surroundings everyone speaks Russian. I'm far away but coming home soon I hope
.@ndls61  Your only method of argument Andy is Ad hominem. Compare Garve's comment. I unblock you &amp; you immediately insult again. Bye
.@gfawkes191 More abuse instead of counterargument. Goodbye
Can you imagine people in USA expressing support for the Texas Independence Party? Decadent of people in RUK to say they support SNP #GE15
People in other parts of UK have no idea what SNP have done to Scotland. The smiling face masks division, abuse, intimidation &amp; fear #GE15
SNP follower want to shut down debate by abuse. Sorry folks I'm going nowhere. More reasoned argument very soon #SNPout #GE2015
Instead of counterargument I'm called hysterical, racist, holocaust denier, moron, mentally ill &amp; worse. Not exactly civil nationalism #GE15
Abusing women for expressing political opinions is popular with misogynists also in the SNP 
@montie @johnmcternan @chrisdeerin In Scotland everyone should vote tactically #SNPout #GE2015
.@Historywoman This weeks blog has been read by more people than any other. I think the argument works. The Nats really hate it &amp; and me
.@MattTweets11 I have duck's back and Nats are just water. But this weekend has been unbelievably nasty. But it just makes me fight harder
@ianallenkerr I just ignore anything with an SNP sign now. If you talk to them they just use it later to abuse you
I'm getting so much abuse at the moment. That I'm not checking the timeline in detail. Apologies if I miss your comment #SNPout #GE2015
Looking for an argument that defeats the SNP &amp; a plan to protect the UK. Look no further  
UK economy has reached 'escape velocity' 
.@david_gould_ Thank you. We need to get this message across throughout the UK. Don't work with people who want to destroy our country #GE15
Full Fiscal Autonomy #AUsterityMax puts Scotland into the position of Greece. Currency union needs transfer union or #Grexit #GE2015
SNP threatens to block defence spending unless Trident is scrapped  
#Grexit likely between May 1st &amp; 12th. Pray Scotland's version of Syriza has no influence on UK govt. 
.@Broty1  I talk pleasantly enough to you then you use the conversation to attack me in an unpleasant way. I've learned my lesson #SNPout
.@Calgus @Broty1 Those things are not the distinguishing characteristics of a country. Lots of parts of countries have them
@johnreb63 Neither does London or Aberdeenshire, Bavaria or California. That is completely beside the point.
.@JaninGlasgow In most countries including  UK it is normal for those who choose to live here to affirm allegiance 
.@eloquentlyfukt I put forward a reasoned argument. You laugh at yourself. Why not put forward a counterargument. Trouble is none of you can
@TraffordLj It is time for bed here. Really appreciate your support. Thanks
In the past 24 hours because I argue against the SNP I have been attacked in ways that turn my stomach. We must defeat these people #SNPout
This is how to defend the UK against all attacks. This defeats the SNP. If we stick together. We win 
One very brilliant SNP supporter gave me a well thought out counterargument. Everyone else attacked me personally #SNPout #GE2015
What did you learn Effie? That in Scotland reasoned argument is not met by counterargument, it's met by abuse #SNPout #GE2015
.@YorkshireLass36 I think I have a fullproof plan for blocking SNP no matter how many are elected. Just need MPs to put country before party
There's something decadent in the way some UK politicians would cooperate in the destruction of our country. Time we started fighting back
There is too much defeatism in the UK press. We're doomed they cry. In fact it's easy to block the SNP. We just need to work together #GE15
@YorkshireLass36 I may well be. But if Pro UK MPs don't cooperate we are all going to be in trouble.
.@ndls61 It's perfectly democratic for 600 MPs to outvote 50. In no democratic country can each part always get what it wants #GE15
.@ndls61 Immigrants pledge to be loyal to the UK. It's straightforward logic 
.@ndls61 It's a very serious point. Members of my family were sent to the Gulag because of ideas like the man's above
@gordonmac Why not provide a counterargument. You just state it's ridiculous.
@jimmywatsontmf You know the answer to that question so why ask it
.@gordonmac  That sounds like I'm an enemy of the people then, just for criticising the SNP. Maybe you can find a nice Gulag for me  #SNPout
.@ndls61 People who come to Britain &amp; become citizens affirm allegiance. This is the same in most countries

No other country in Europe would cooperate with those who seek to destroy us. Nor should we  
.@ColinWHutch This is the pattern all day. I make serious reasoned arguments. Opponents claim I am mad. Welcome to modern day Scotland #GE15
.@Marx_ist  I think you are assuming what you are trying to prove. Simply stating it doesn't help. That is called begging the question
@JamieMcBastard He drops by once in a while, but we remain reasonably civil

@DonnellyHugh I wish they had borrowed less. For decades UK has been living beyond means. We need to spend less &amp; earn more
@mhairigrealis The SNP surge must have put lots of voters in an unfamiliar situation. Safe Labour seat now marginal. So uncertainty
.@Broty1 I think the argument is circularity is the other way round. SNP assume Scotland is a country in order to prove independence #GE15
@Tobbes73 I think Christine has a chance. Salmond's weakness is he's over confident. But was with Nicola this weekend in Gordon. Worried?
.@ndls61 I'm in favour of immigration.  
.@Broty1 Scotland lacks the distinguishing characteristics of a country. It makes as much sense for Aberdeenshire to claim independence
@mhairigrealis My guess is that most voters have made up mind. But some tactical voters not sure how best to vote
.@kh_99 Don't worry. I find the abuse inspires me to write another blog. It just shows the SNP can't argue so scream at women instead #GE15
@Tobbes73 If there's going to be a coalition we need calm voices. LDs did a great job past 5 years. Made a massive difference to UK
If you think there's an alternative to living beyond our means &amp; spending more money we don't have read this 
.@WalleyVision That's the message I'm trying to get across to people in all parts of the UK. We need to stick together &amp; value our country
.@dharmabum013 You people love to distort an argument rather than find a counterargument. It's much easier but not terribly effect #SNPout
.@rabana45 I have no idea what you are talking about. Why would I need a diversion? I write reasoned blogs. Happy for all to read #GE2015
.@WalleyVision  I am tired of so many pro UK journalists writing in such a defeatist way. It's time to fight back. Easy to snooker SNP #GE15
.@highconstable Unless there is evidence of wrong doing people should be left alone. Fundamentally illiberal not to do so
.@RedToriesUK Nation and country are virtually synonymous. If you substitute nation for country in the syllogism it works just the same
@anoracyracen I think anywhere within reason could be a country, but what I really would like is a fully democratic US of EU with devolution
@emmamaryjohnson Time is a great healer. Scotland will be very divided for many years to come whatever any of say or do
@wishfullythinks @LabourBloke Local knowledge is always one of the key things to take into account. People on ground know best
@anoracyracen I'm questioning assumption that Scotland, Wales England etc are countries. Whether indy is a good or bad thing another matter
Biggest danger to the UK is described in this story by Iain Martin. 

@anoracyracen I think we can change the status quo while remaining one country. But respect those who are always going to disagree
@anoracyracen I'm actually arguing for a change in emphasis rethinking the UK as being more like the USA or Germany
If English Labour voters end up being ruled by Nicola Sturgeon at a 2nd #GE2015 they might switch allegiance. Labour must keep #SNPout
Labour making a deal with SNP effectively means Labour cease to exist in Scotland. SNP would become the new name for Scottish Labour #GE2015
@anoracyracen I'm not sure I understand, but I agree that some change can be good. I would prefer more local power for instance
If the SNP made a deal with the Conservatives, what would we call them Yellow Tories? #GE15 #SNPout
.@WiseScot Saw tweet from Iain Martin who is a very good journalist suggesting Cons would do this. Which other country acts this way?
.@myrockyrocks I tweet politely. If you want to see pressure you should see abuse &amp; intimdiation I get for puttng forward reasoned argument
Biggest danger UK is that Cons offer FFA in exchange for EVEL. That = independence later. #GE2015 For alternative

@myrockyrocks We have a secret ballot. No one needs to listen to me. But I have a right to campaign as does everyone else
@emmamaryjohnson If everyone in the world was Chinese. The word Chinese would turn out to mean person. Words have to distinguish
@emmamaryjohnson That's the problem. We need to change the perspective in order to defeat nationalism.
.@CyranodEcosse @Tobbes73 I think the Lib Dems realise that the best chance of retaining most of MPs in Scotland is tactical voting #SNPout
.@Tobbes73 We're hoping our tactical voting wheel will give us 7 LD MPs who would put country before party #SNPout 
We could solve West Lothian question easily by bypassing national parliaments &amp; having all possible decisions made locally #SNPout
Eurozone heading for more chaos. UK needs united govt that will take tough decisions. Don't get hung by Nats 
.@rabana45 Scotland lacks the defining characteristic which is held by 99% of countries. That too is a fact #SNPout
.@MairiClaire42  I propose more local democracy so that more important decisions are taken at the district or even town level.
.@GaryWatson_92 It looks sometimes as if rational argument about the SNP is just not possible. The personal abuse is unbelievable #SNPout
@emmamaryjohnson  Here's the OED definition. Here's the argument

By @EffieDeans:

PS: I'm a left-wing Scottish Briton + I hat…
.@AFrankWords A Dane who loves his country &amp; does not wish it to break up is not a nationalist. Neither am I. Absurd &amp; offensive to say I am
If you criticise assumptions on which SNP are based they react with fury &amp; thereby show how effective the argument is 
It's not undemocratic if a part of a country does not get what it wants. If it were democracy anywhere in world would be impossible #SNPout
It does not matter how many seats SNP wins. Don't identity it with the people. That makes me an enemy of the people #SNPout
.@Macnessie  I'm not against democracy anywhere. I just view from UK perspective. 600 MPs will outnumber democratically the SNP #SNPout
.@andyforfreedom I don't interact with people who call me a fascist. Now you're blocked. Attacking SNP assumptions is not fascist #SNPout
.@andyforfreedom I have argued this viewpoint on numerous occasions. Now I simply give fair warning anyone who uses Brit Nat gets blocked
.@Arthur93831734 People in Bavaria are Bavarian patriots but they do not on the whole want independence
.@MinstrelMusings  More abuse instead of argument. That's what Scotland looks like because of SNP #SNPout
.@Arthur93831734  If UK politicians follow plan outlined in blog it's very easy to snooker SNP. Already said no 2nd indyref. Soon no deals
.@KeithRSteele If they dislike the argument I make in the blog they need to make counterarguments. But they can't so they abuse. #SNPout
.@WiseScot This is much worse. No comparison. I've been called a holocaust, denier, a traitor, mentally ill a moron etc etc #'SNPout
.@Historywoman Quite so. They love to make personal attacks on women who dare to argue and use reason. But we're going nowhere #SNPout
.@rabana45 I attack the assumption that is the foundation of the SNP. The argument is not about self-determination
The SNP's very Scottish conspiracy 
@Bill60663862 EU is obviously not a country. At least not yet. UK obviously is as it as the defining characteristic of a country sovereignty
I use reason in my blogs &amp; try to be as polite as possible, but get called a traitor, a moron &amp; mentally ill. The facade slips sometimes
Tendency to identify SNP with Scottish people, makes me an enemy of the people. My relations went to the gulag for that reason #SNPout
Attacking SNP arguments &amp; assumptions is not attacking Scotland or Scottish people. SNP does not = the people. That view dangerous #SNPout
@Benotadick UK is my country. Most people in most countries the world over like them to remain intact
@joe90kane I am not referring to people as weeds. I am referring to an assumption and an argument. SNP does not = Scottish people
@JennieMacfie Just look at my time-line for some of the most disgusting abuse nearly always from nationalist men. No doubt you approve
@JennieMacfie Don't be silly. I am arguing against SNP assumptions. Why not find a counterargument instead of distortions #SNPout
.@Iainwith2ayes I was born near Aberdeen. No I'm not English. But wouldn't it be dreadful if I were. So much for civic nationalism.
.@davecochrane I have explained in detail why I find "Brit Nat" offensive and given argument for it. Calling someone a fascist is abusive
.@NeilSargent86 Are you terrified by reasoned argument. Why not come up with a counterargument. You should try the personal abuse I get
.@pringle_jimmy People are voting for the SNP because they want independence, others vote #SNPout because we don't. One issue in GE
.@joe90kane Don't be absurd. I am attacking an argument. The whole blog is an argument. Why not try a counterargument #SNPout
@Benotadick I have very little pride in the UK &amp; dislike flag waving. I've lived abroad &amp; think those countries just as good as ours
.@hail2thequeen My blogs are reasoned. I don't receive counterargument I receive personal abuse. From you as well. Name calling #SNPout
Here's an interesting story about a woman blogger being abused by men

.@Crisiscult It's not a matter I debate. I treat anyone who calls me a British nationalist the same as if they call me a fascist
.@jamiemcconville  A Dane is not a nationalist because he loves his country &amp; wants it to remain intact. Nor am I. Meaningless to say I am
.@davecochrane  Yes that's the idea. I block all abuse. British nationalist is abusive So I always block it immediately
.@colinmckayy I have written extensively on civic nationalism 
.@ArmstrongVinnie I am always happy to have people put counterarguments. But I have simply received abuse in past 24 hours
We must attack the SNP at its roots 
It is possible to have a reasoned debate with opponents. Look at the comment section, but the vast majority simply hurl abuse #SNPout
I have never before received quite so much personal abuse for making a reasoned argument. Scotland is becoming a scary place #SNPout
A Dane who has a little flag, loves his country &amp; wants it to remain intact is not a nationalist. Neither am I. Meaningless to say I am
@Crisiscult Would hate to block you. You have appeared reasonable.
.@WingsScotland By your logic everyone in the world would be a nationalist. In that case the word would drop out of use as meaningless
.@Andrew_Pettie I block everyone who calls me a nationalist. It is self-evidently false &amp; offensive 
@JockMcDonnell @traquir @Sneekyboy  More abuse. Thanks Sneaky for sending the Nat hordes. If only you all came ready blocked
.@gfawkes191 @C4rl31 Burtisland is not an island, but it is called one
.@proffalken2 Again I put forward reasoned argument &amp; get abuse. Can you people not even argue at all?
.@gerrymckay You don't understand the word nationalism. Calling me a British nationalist gets you blocked #SNPout 
.@PhotoTweetyScot This video shows that it is meaningless to pick one date in history and say we will recreate those borders #SNPout
.@blamemonkey @tedermeatballs I put forward reasoned argument. You put forward shameful abuse. I need to go and wash my hands #SNPout
@PDevlin1 I will have no disappointment no matter how many SNP MPs are elected. It wlll make no difference. Easy to ignore #SNPout

@Sneekyboy If all UK politicians followed the plan I outline it would work very well indeed. Only question is if they have the guts to do it
.@DrMoragKerr SNP were trivial when I was a child. They had almost no seats whatsoever. In what sense atypical
@NeurolawGuy @malcolmcameron7 @KeithRSteele Thanks chaps. It means a lot.
There's a simple way to beat the SNP forever. We need UK politicians to hear this message. if they do we win 
.@funk_soulboy It matters not one jot what SNP supporters think or don't think. We're working together to block you forever #SNPout
@arobson58 I'm all for devolution &amp; want it to be fair to everyone. Let's devolve as much as possible, but we need to unite too
@craigdo45838184 @TheMistressRox @dht1690 @SNPOut Only a moral degenerate would try to use child abuse to score political points. Disgusting
.@funk_soulboy No doubt you would prefer it if we all agreed with the SNP instead of trying to prove their arguments wrong #SNPout
@Indepshop Perhaps they haven't thought about it. Perhaps they will now. Some points already agreed I think. We'll see
.@FaeTroon I don't think there's any strong language in what I wrote. Reason can sometimes make people change their mind. Or not #SNPout
.@cambiecams You seemed reasonable for a minute, but a little bit of reasonings sees you and your like self-deterstruct #SNPout
.@Indepshop Thank you for reading. Can you point out the flaw in my plan for stopping the SNP in its tracsk? #SNPout
.@celtic_spring Abuse plus "Brit Nat" gets you blocked. Can you people not even argue?
@Ben_Wray1989 There is not one sentence that is racist and it is outrageous for you to imply that there is. Very dirty politics.
.@C4rl31  Quite a good argument. Burtisland is an island in the sense in which Scotland is a country.
.@arobson58 How many countries can you name that are not independent? It's a defining characteristic ergo. The logic is quite simple #SNPout
.@arobson58 I agree we are not at war. I am contributing to the constitutional debate by arguing against SNP assumptions
@Ben_Wray1989 Yes. You quote someone saying I am a low grade racist. You endorse that. You have racism as a subject
We must change the perspective of the argument &amp; attack the SNP's assumptions. Here's how to defeat them 
@Ben_Wray1989 You call me a racist. That is untrue and defamatory. Please withdraw the comment. My blog is pro immigration.
.@ianbrannan1 Ireland achieved independence by means of revolution &amp; civil war. Australia &amp; Canada were not part of UK
@Jonathon_Shafi Your accusation that I am a racist in 

@cambiecams No irony at all. It makes perfect sense for polar opposites to unite against a common opponent the SNP which does not = Scots
@cambiecams It's perfectly democratic. I view democracy from a UK perspective. There is only one nation state with 650 MPs. You lose
Blog by @Ben_Wray1989 is libelous. I'm pro immigration. Is it racist for USA to ask people to pledge allegiance?

.@cambiecams There is nothing undemocratic about 600 Mps outvoting 50. Quite the reverse in fact
.@QuincyWillis It doesn't matter how many SNP MPs there are after GE, I have shown how they can be ignored &amp; blocked forever #SNPout
.@snapperup Key to defeating an opponent's argument is to refute his assumption. We must attack roots &amp; poor weed killer in the hole #SNPout
@stuart_stumcg That's OK. Thanks for getting back in such a pleasant manner. It makes the debate much more enjoyable
.@stuart_stumcg  I put forward a detailed reasoned argument &amp; your response is you've lost it. This is a microcosm of the debate #SNPout
.@ThigArLatha @SuicideBiscuits What I said follows logically from your claim that Scotland is a colony. Who are the colonisers?
.@ThigArLatha Who are the colonizers? And who are the true Scots. Go down this route and you have ethnic nationalism. Is that your position?
.@ThigArLatha By who has Scotland been colonised? English people, Poles, or Pakistanis? You realise the implications of what you are saying?
@ThigArLatha Scotland is not a colony. Simply absurd to suggest it is
@mhairigrealis I think Scotland has changed a lot in those 12 years. I wish we could go back to what it was like then
.@nairnkev That path puts the SNP leaders in jail. Please do try. It would amuse me no end.
@mhairigrealis We've made a right mess of the UK in the past 20 years with unequal devolution. That's why we're disengaged
@mikereynoldsuk @spazbeker Bavaria was an historical country until 1871 just as much as Scotland and England
@ruskadoronin All I'm doing is pointing out the logic of the position.  There are intelligent &amp; foolish people on both sides
