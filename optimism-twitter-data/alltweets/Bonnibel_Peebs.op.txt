@Fionna_Human15 "There~" 
@Jack_Fire69 // uhh...? I was rping and she's not having sex with Jack.
@__PeridotDTMS @BigCheetoPuff "Oh my.." She whispered as she walked by, attempting to avert her eyes, to allow for privacy..
@Nag1saFurukawa @Jack_Fire69 "You don't just start bleeding from your nasal cavity for no reason !"
@OriginalBubsRA - brain tumor. Like..yesterday."
@OriginalBubsRA With an extended hand, she offered him some coffee. "Coffee? We're going to need it. We have to remove @Jack_Fire69 's -

"Oh my..Jaspidot..It's so early..~"
@Fionna_Human15 "I'll make ya a new one!"
@Optimistic_Gon //- older than me. Ah. He loved it.

@Jack_Fire69 // Man. She looks like she at least works out, too.. Like she's a little toned. What's wrong with this guy? Lol
@Jack_Fire69 // yeah she's super comfortable with herself and is thusly pobs not a total bitch.
@Jack_Fire69//- it a hot chick.
@Jack_Fire69 // purple hair chick ain't even cute. Why guys always cheat down and not up? Like.. If I were a dude and gonna cheat, I'd make-

@INSANOWILLRULE She bit into her own lower lip and pressed her body, gently, against his. "..high level..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "Is it...related to being..naked..?~"
@INSANOWILLRULE A soft hum in thought escaped her. "So..I wish there were something I could do to..make it better."
@INSANOWILLRULE "Poor John.. So bold. So angry.. Like..sexual." Her face pressed into his hair as she nuzzled him. "I bet it was so scary."
"Oh glob..yes." 
@INSANOWILLRULE "That sounds just terrifying." She brought his head to rest against her chest. "It's ok~"
"That nerd chunk makes me so hot."
@INSANOWILLRULE She bit into her lower lip. "..Oh no! What! That's crazy.."

@Jack_Fire69 // it's not finished~
@scarletspider24// well..? Is it a single thing or is she really that charming?
@Jack_Fire69// hmm?

"Your love your love your love..is my drug~"
@BubblegumDamsel - planning the return..~"
@BubblegumDamsel She shook her head some. "Nah.. I'm sure it's going to be great. A lot of people spend their entire time from their spouses
//..I may have all of the Disney princesses..*looks around..*
@Jack_Fire69 // just a little corner. I've got princesses galore. And lotions.
@BubblegumDamsel - you know..?"
@BubblegumDamsel "You are welcome.." A deep exhale escaped her. "Sometimes you just need that.. To get along with your life for a bit, you -
// my girly nook. Needs more pink~ 
// @OriginalBubsRA would like Penelope 
@OriginalBubsRA "You could just go ask her..!"
// I'm like..no, dude, I'm just not into short guys. - He was like.. 5'6. I'm 5'5 on a good day, so 5'4.
//My NCO used to prey on married women whose spouses were deployed.. He got so pissed when he thought I wasn't into Hispanic guys.
@BubblegumDamsel - she held the princess in her own embrace.
@BubblegumDamsel - just as magnetic and powerful as the war she's in.." The provoked memories caused a little shudder to run through her as-
@BubblegumDamsel "Well..Did you send any letters..? You know she needs the encouragement, too..To know that she's coming home to something-
// It could fill in the gaps of Peebs relationship and her animosity with the Flame King.
@BubblegumDamsel - for it. Love is no exception to this rule. Your heart is so ready to give and receive love. Just wait a little longer.."
@BubblegumDamsel - "Bonni.. Everything and anything worth attaining carries with it the added value of the effort you've put into working-
@BubblegumDamsel - Princesses sobs. Gentle, and sweet. She pulled the Princess just a bit closer. Her own voice dropped to a soft whisper;-
@BubblegumDamsel The only sounds resonating for at least ten minutes are the shifting of the Princess against her own fleece coat and the -
// Holy shit..we need to do a post mushroom clan war... Indicating a division of land. That would be BOMB. #teamfirekingdom.
//..You can be my universe , Gregg~
@BubblegumDamsel - ok..?"
@BubblegumDamsel - clans and were vying for land..? And look how far our patience and effort has brought us, Peebles. So just..patience.-
@BubblegumDamsel - Pink fingertips slid along her back, urging more comfort. "I understand..war is hard. Remember when we were all just-
@BubblegumDamsel Immediately, and silently, her arms slid around the Princess, drawing her into a warming and bubblegum scented embrace.-
"PB vs PB. Fight~!" 
@BubblegumDamsel - even is. I certainly hope you don't go about your science with this approach."
@BubblegumDamsel Her hand withdrew. A bit of a curious and perplexed look formed on her face. "Sure are ready to count her down before she-
@BubblegumDamsel "..Hey. It's okay. She will be home soon." Bonni rested a palm against other Bonni's shoulder.
@Bonnibel_Peebs //- parents that want you. Happy Mothers Day~
// Sometimes..when you post about how awful your parents are for wanting to take you out to dinner or whatever, I go...must be nice to have-
"I'm..gonna...I donno. My face hurts."

@OriginalBubsRA // Nope. Wouldn't have happened.
// night
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..I..I'm going to..." She curled up a bit more and fell into a light sleep.
@JamieMailman // dude..get out of my head..it's like "woah...life..life is...just. Life."
// The most active PB account is also the most active Poison Ivy account..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Oh..I see." She nodded some.
@SubduedLeader "Who's ready for the Ricktatorship?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - "Surprised this thing is still running."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Pictures? Hidef, she hopes. Lucky him. She had won the battle against sleep..and was just peering around the car. -
// I thought my sick husband was watching porn.. When I went to surprise sex him, I realized he was actually just watching basketball.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st In silence she thought. Just thought. Which..was much better than making her think aloud.
@Broflamingo "Nena. She recorded it in both German and English. When..she put it out. Original artist."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st A smile beamed up at him. "Yeah.. I suppose you're right." She would've reached out to take his hand, but..
"99 Red Balloons is my favorite song. Ever."
@Bonnibel_Peebs - springs to life.. Opens up one eager eye. Focusing it on the sky where 99 red balloons go by.."
"99 red balloons..floating in the summer sky. Panic bells it's red alert. There's something here from somewhere else. The war machine -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Oh! That's sweet of you.." She nuzzled into the seat. "..Actually, that made me feel good."
"And when I see her dancin..wanna take a chance and..move in a little closer.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Sorry.. At least I'm not giggling like last time..that's obnoxious."
@Bonnibel_Peebs - your face, it's haunting me."
"Every time I try to fly, I fall..without those wings, I feel so small..and now I need you baby.. Every night I see you in my dreams. I see-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She grinned. Clearly very tired, and fighting it. "..I confuse pronouns and make people cry."
"you need everyone's eyes just to feel seen by.. That's sad. If someone just..straight up ignored my love, I'd be pissed.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - use that knowledge against you..? I worked so hard."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Her speech began lagging.. "Well..we are married, so it's not like..I mean..I worked so very hard for you... Why would I -
@Bonnibel_Peebs - you probably won't ya think you're cooler than me."
"You got designer shades just..to hide ya face and you wear em around like ya cooler than me..and..ya never say hey or remember my name and-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Curling up, she turned to face him. "I think..I'm sure he mentioned it.." Very slowly, she reached for a blanket.
@Bonnibel_Peebs - you like this..but you probably won't cuz you're cooler than me."
"If I could write you a song to make you fall in love, I would already have you right under my arm. I used up all of my tricks, I hope that-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "...You said something about that..other you. Him. You.." She rubbed her eyes.
"What does the Fox say?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Oh. Well..in that case..uh. You allergic to eggplants, too..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - "What does the Fox say..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - many things that would more appropriately fit than what she did say, which, she formed a brilliant smile as she said;-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st In this critical space of silence, there were many things she could say. Confessions, deep questions about life pre War. So-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - cause any pain or damage to her sleeping John. Her eyes steadied on the cab, overhead. "John..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Ok." Pink fingers played along her buttons, unfastening them. She gripped the recline and very slowly, ensuring not to-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Yep..just..useless little..grains of nothing." Her body arched as she stretched. Sleep was going to take her , soon.
"..Why is this happening?!"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - tendrils bounced as she nodded. "Sand is inedible. Uh..."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Keep it light, Shakespeare.. Okay. Sand. Small. Did you know that parrot fish spit out sand when they eat coral..?" Pink-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - much research or studying done.. Yes. Sand. Sand is my choice of conversation."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - She gave him a little nudge. "Just..bookish things..make me..a little anxious and..anyway, I have never been able to get-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..I'm not saying we have to examine the lifeforms on Hoth or Coruscant, but you're making me think a little too much.." -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - that I'm supposed to. Something mind numbing like..grains of sand."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "No..I suppose not..I ..can we just talk about something less engaging? I'm finding myself quite engaged and I'm not sure-
"..Glob..history..I'm gonna die."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - useless history.. Hundred years war, for example."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I wouldn't quite say that.. We still teach dinosaurs. We aren't completely ...inept. I mean..we do forego some of the-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Okay. Sure. Fine. I get that.." She was becoming a little anxious. Fidgeting some. "But..we're what became of you..them."
"Talking about governments is getting me hot~" 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - We are okay.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - was a tent for Simon and Marcy. A literal tent. I've managed to smoothly run things..minus a few slip ups, but..I think-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "President Penguin's second term begins soon, actually.." She had to correct him. "Before I began building my kingdom, I -
"Don't be so lewd..but.. Can I tell you a secret..? I'd like that." 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - mine..is still hard to even picture."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - say that I have a soft spot for humans.. They're life, and I value that., but the idea of a human civilization before -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I was here for the tail end of the mushroom war.. But.. Aside from Simon and Finn.. And a few I've met recently, I can't -
"Maybe..a bit more than a kiss?" 
"..hmm. I'd like that. #science " 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - altogether unimaginable.. I've always sorta wanted to just ..taste the ocean. Just to experience it, yknow..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Her gaze settled upon him. "I bet the smell..the taste.. The cool ocean water spraying you. I bet it was something -
"I've never tried!" 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -something simply beautiful.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - used to be, however. Just imagine picking up sea shells instead of bits of decayed coral. Mmm. Yep.. I bet it was -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st The beach always peaked her interest. "Yeah, I love the ocean. It's very solitudinous. I bet it's nothing quite like it -
"Darn...I'm boring."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - have much to say or know how to engage him.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Now bundled and warm, she drew her knees to her chest once more. She wasn't much fun on these sorts of trips as she didn't -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She nodded some as she slid back into the front seat. "..Yeah. You told me that already."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - door, she slid out and rummaged for blankets, thick coats and anything else for layering.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - front seats, as she began inspecting him.. "He seems fine..thankfully there's stuff in the floor.." Carefully opening the-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Oh glob!" Playfully, she thumped at his bicep. "That was such a mean accident!" Her body leaned back, between the two -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - peered up at him with a soft smile.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - temperature. The approach was happening. "Hey.. Stop and lemme get those blankets and jackets and things out, ok..?" She-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I just worry.. I wouldn't want you to fall asleep..and get either of you killed..or hurt..you know..?" Ooh. A drop in -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - volume.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -knees. "Hey...life has been especially long for me. What's a few more hours awake..?" She reached out and lowered the ~
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..I can't let you..be awake and drive alone so late.." She pulled her knees to her chest, her chin resting against her -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - and...likes harassing my people. Dude goes in and out of jail all the time." A soft yawn escaped her.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Nah. Just some bozo thinks he's the King of Ooo. Typical con man. Tyrannical.. Unfortunately, he engages my kingdom a lot-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - well have good reasons for being such a pain..But,..probably not." A soft chuckle escaped her.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I..don't think you were the villain then, nor ever. Just rigid in your moral code, I suppose.. I mean, my nemesis may very-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - could..But.. I don't want to. I wanted to create and love it, together.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - really believe that there was some goodness in your heart. I was also scared..I can't raise your baby alone. I mean.. I -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - yourself away..? When you wanted to..?" Her gaze now peered at him, intently. "No..I was just..selfish and I wanted to -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She shook her head some. "Heroism is completely relative.. Would I have been a hero earlier, if..I just let You take -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - on my deathbed or something, but I'm pretty certain it'll take World War 4 to end me..and..you're welcome."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I'll forgive her when I'm less pregnant." She nodded at him. "Or never. Probably closer to I'm going to forget until I'm -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - my problem.. You see? Because I can't let it go."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - distasteful situation.. Needless to say.. It was like 300 years ago and I still can't completely forgive her.. She's just-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -"So..when I finally worked the nerve up to ask her if she would let me learn with her.. I walked into..uh..a very -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - struggle.. I thought it was sweet. I wanted to learn, too. We could make music together.." She had to pause for a moment.-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Actually..when she was learning bass, Ash was teaching her. I used to stay up late at night and just listen to her -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -like this album by him." She reached for her own bottle of water and twisted the cap off.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st With a soft sigh, she soon calmed. "Thought this was for special occasions?" A pink brow perked at him, inquisitively. "I -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -same time."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - herself, even. "I -didn't- say she had to be perfect, John... I just... Said she couldn't see Ash while seeing me..at the-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - nobody wants to hear about the words you put in my mouth.." She was arguing, almost as if she were trying to convince -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Glob..great. I told her not to record this one." She threw her hand at the radio in irritation. "Like come on, Marcy,-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - a soft kiss against his cheek. "I'm sorry..I needed this..and thank you.." She regretted withdrawing from their embrace.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "We should get back on the road..the whywolves here are inquisitive and snarky.." A last, tender expression as she pressed -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - It was her.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - and tenderly. There was somebody out there, for whom his passion burned. Maybe, for just a moment, a very long time ago,-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Yeah..yeah, her own empathy of such a similar notion reflects back, into him. Pink fingertips grazed at his cheek, lightly,-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -funny things, aren't they..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -express this simple act a bit more than he needed it lavished, perhaps. "Time and..universes and fate are all very -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Didn't it quite seem like this was a very natural thing? Well, in any case.. Tenderly, she nuzzled into him. She needed to-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - fringe. "Like..the universe is just really frazzled right now.." Her body relaxed a bit in his arms.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "It seems as if hugs and warmth are on short supply lately, you know..?" Slowly, her gaze rose, only to meet her own pink-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - "Thanks.." She whispered softly. "I really needed this." She offered him a slight smile.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Soon her arms slid around him, returning the warm embrace. A deep exhale escaped her as she allowed herself to be held.-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - just beneath her surface. Her gaze diverted to the window. "..Sorry."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - was just a little hard to hear back there and.." His emotions were causing her's to stir, and her's were always lying -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..I'm sorry." She offered him a very gentle nod. "..I didn't mean to imply..I just thought you maybe needed to talk..it -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - tragedies, but rather to offer a differing perspective.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - kingdom.. I mean.. They've been pretty absent, but..supportive none the less.." She wasn't trying to mask over his -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She managed to climb into the seat beside him. "I can't really relate..my parents are a singular blob beneath the candy -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - attempts to calm him were probably in vain. She totally couldn't relate to rejection from a family member.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I..don't know what to say..maybe we should turn around, huh..? Maybe just stop for a minute? Relax? Just..breathe?" Her-
"Just kidding~" 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - me..heh." A soft color pinkened at her cheeks...until she mumbled, "I never said she had to be perfect, ok..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Do you even love me? Well, I wish you'd show it. Cause, I wouldn't know it. "..Well..Uh! At least it's not that one about-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - broadcast is..being played from a bunker I couldn't get into." Part of her just..didn't want to.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Oh.. I see. By the by...if you just slide the dial to the mid 90's..they play a lot of Marcelines music. That emergency-
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st - Leaning forward, she reached for the radio's knobs.
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st "Oh!...he fell asleep.." Her soft grip on his hand tightened a bit. "..Say.. This radio still work..?" -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - right..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE "Well..great. Because..we're an hour away from 'Freezing your cherries off' territory~ We have..warm things-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - snow chains..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - happy, even if it is just a bit." He mood actually had greatly improved, it seemed. "..hey..do we have -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE A little idly, her fingertips tapped against the window. "Well. I'm glad you've found someone to make you-
@PyrrhicWriter // I posted a video of me giving my son candy to say "Dick Grayson sucks eggs" or whatever, he never did. Dude got butthurt.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - Maybe it had to do with his gardening.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE "I've been noticing some strange overgrowth patterns lately, despite the dry growing season." She hummed.-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - time." She thought some and beamed a little smile up to her Doc. "Probably close to..500 years, maybe..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE Her gaze lifted from the floorboard to the mirror. "This is the longest I've been in a car-- in a very long-
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st - to reminisc about regarding any applicable history with them. Her head rested against his shoulder, gently
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st She remained silent for the most part while the idle banter went on. She really didn't have much too much-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - at her John's hand, holding it, gently.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE "I wouldn't be too offended, honestly.. Robin is.. Offputting to say the least." She reached out and -
//10 seconds is all you get lol. 
//Just wanted to share my viewpoint. Enjoy the solitude. 
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st "I don't like Dick Grayson." She held a slight glare at the Doc. Her doc. "In fact.. He can eat a Dick."
@officialNellis "Deploying incendiary ammo.." "grabbin incendiary ammo."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE She hummed idly as she pulled her knees up, against her chest. T-E-E-N T-I-T-A-N-S. Teen ti-tans. Let's go..
@officialNellis "I hear a hunter"
@officialNellis "Pills over here."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE - into his hand, then offered the other to her John.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE She dug around some. Luggage. Duffle bags. MRE's.. And water. She grabbed three and very slowly slid one-
@officialNellis "Auto Shotties, too. Just smack you right off with the buttstock and..then shoot ya."
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st -can..I have a water...?"
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st Very slowly, she slid into the car. She remained silent a bit..before asking, as she peered up at him "C..-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE A bit awestricken, she nodded some. "Okay.."
"Agreed." 
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st "..Y...y....yeah..."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @QueenAntiLove @INSANOWILLRULE - caused a nervous giggle to spill from her.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @QueenAntiLove @INSANOWILLRULE - omniscient, but..the tension that seemed to hang between the two was quite..thick. It -
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st She clutched his arm a little tighter as they approached the Lantern and Chrysalis. She was by no means -
@aromaticBayonet Silently, she held Diane. Pulling her just a bit closer. "Just..just let it out. Just cry, Diane.." She exhaled, softly.
@INSANOWILLRULE - even got by on MRE alone. They're so.. I mean.." She shot her John a little grin.
@INSANOWILLRULE She gagged. "I'm always left so anemic with the vegetarian ones, but.. The meat ones are so yucky. I'm not sure how you -
@JamieMailman //Sapphire. Sorry. Just laying here. 
@aromaticBayonet She held Diane close to her own body, cradling her.
@INSANOWILLRULE - bump just a little bigger.
@INSANOWILLRULE - wasn't too concerned with her own nutrition at present, as she had been gaining weight pretty steadily, her little baby -
@INSANOWILLRULE "Ooh! You're eager~" Pulled from her seat, she followed. Soon, a little giggle spilled from her. "Vegetarian MRE's..?" She-
@PyrrhicWriter // he uh..lol.. He likes Dick Grayson, but it's not okay for me to dislike him,
@INSANOWILLRULE - and other provisions packed? I don't want any crazy accidents happening!" A pink hand reached out to take his.
@INSANOWILLRULE "Time..? Oh. Our trip.. John.. This is going to be quite a drive. I mean.. We're talking Iceland.. Is there enough water -
// Also..lol..you aren't funny.
// If that's your account.. Please know I reported it for suicide. Pull that shit elsewhere and excuse any other accounts from my life~
// Worse than fucking Draco. 
// Come at me with feelings -after- I take a nap and eat.
// Oh no...whoops. Guys, don't menstruate at me right now over my son's love for this dumb show. 
@SheriffOfUnova // I told you to take a joke. I'm about to tell you to eat a Dick. Grayson.
//..I'm sorry, but you people aren't allowed to have vaginas while I'm drinking. Its irritating.
@SheriffOfUnova // so then.. #learntotakeajoke
@SheriffOfUnova // Dick Grayson. Get over it.

@SolitaryAdie // tbh, he calls robin "Teen titan"...and has learned the names of the others. So...
@Broflamingo // Yeah it is. Imma cosplay as a 28 year old. Bet.
//You have to start them young or else they won't know who to hate.

@UchihaNicole @ScitzoTerra//..Fucking reservists.
@INSANOWILLRULE - or not~"
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded and beamed up at him, quite happily. "Okay~ I mean..it'll be fun. You never really said if you enjoyed the beach-
@INSANOWILLRULE - feel...right."
@INSANOWILLRULE She wasn't sure how she should feel about this being so openly discussed, because when he says it out loud.. "It doesn't...-
@INSANOWILLRULE - at the prospect.
@INSANOWILLRULE "I..ooh!.. But.." It would probably take some convincing, or..natural chemistry. A deep pinkish hue colored at her cheeks -
@FSketchy @Broflamingo @TeamGOATface @yung_hentai @Sekiryuteii @nikkai07 @emulatelife // Just screen print it yourself.
@INSANOWILLRULE "you're so naughty. I love you."
@INSANOWILLRULE "I can be as bad as need be.." A little grin crept onto her lips. "You know that."
@INSANOWILLRULE "Well...I hope not too much fun. Too much of anything can be a bad thing~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "I want to before our little trip, but.. Maybe a little later this evening."
@INSANOWILLRULE "Tu voudrais manges le bonbon..?"
@Jack_Fire69 // nah. But I always usually just keep them open. One for music, others for references,
//Always 5-7. Always. 
//Je bois le biere.
//My friend Kat, whose tea party I went to, just had her first baby. Tristram Gabriel. ~~~ No, I'm not having another.
@aromaticBayonet - miserable with someone else."
@aromaticBayonet It was tough love. And.. It looked like Diane needed it. "The thing is, being miserable and alone is worse than being -
"Mon amour est John. Il mange le bonbon. Je suis le bonbon."~
@Broflamingo "Whatever it is.. We have Lemonhope."
@Broflamingo "They need it. And look, my guardians kept my people in a safe stasis."
@Broflamingo // PB runs shit.
@Broflamingo // the Graybles?
@BadRPAdvice "4. Happy, sad, angry, pregnant."
@aromaticBayonet "..Sounds like you enjoy wasting time and then reveling in the misery. You gotta stop."
@aromaticBayonet She shook her head once more. "But..if you feel alright now, when before you didn't, how could you have wasted your time?"
@aromaticBayonet - Lantern, at least you'd understand your feelings better. And maybe grow a little..It wasn't to pour salt in an wound."
@aromaticBayonet "It's not a problem, Diane. I just hate that you can't love yourself.. I really just thought if you at least spoke to the-
@Jack_Fire69 // I didn't respond to your Ooc comments because I don't do Ooc on that one.

@aromaticBayonet -- as in, it makes me sad."
@aromaticBayonet "Hate..? I don't hate anything of you. Well..I take it back. I hate that you hate yourself so much. It's...a little sad--
//Cyan..Yellow..Magenta..Black.. I'm so angry at Photoshop right now.
@aromaticBayonet "You aren't a bother." A gentle head shake sent pink tresses into a bounce. "Not a bother."
@aromaticBayonet - of the essence. You have to surge into it. And make demands." She reached out to hold Diane.
@aromaticBayonet "I think it was your opportunity. To show him, you know..? That's why, despite being hundreds of years old, time is still-
@aromaticBayonet - to be a Happily Ever After for that plant chick." She nodded.
@aromaticBayonet "..You..sure..?" Her palm rested gently against Diane's shoulder. "..For the record, I am not certain that there's going -
// lol 
@Jack_Fire69 @GenderbendMarcy //..I haven't seen them in the states..? Must be a special thing.
@Jack_Fire69 @GenderbendMarcy "..They...have those?"
@aromaticBayonet - around won't be a bad idea."
@aromaticBayonet - emotionally, then maybe a vacation is in order. If..you think you can deal with those feelings, then maybe hanging -
@aromaticBayonet She thought a bit, before answering. "I think you should seek happiness. If being in the Candy Kingdom hurts you, -
@GenderbendMarcy "Well, Oreos and coffee are neither red."
@aromaticBayonet She nodded. "Possession and stuff."
@AmITheSky // - Grayson. Dick.
@AmITheSky// I was thinking..if dude uh..spends as much time on your Wi-Fi as he does on his hair, it would be ok.. He makes me think of -
//Thanks~
@mybbysftme "Awh...lady"
//..This dude comes to fix your Wi-Fi. What's an offputting comment on his hair? Note- he's just a model, so..he's ok 
@mybbysftme @INSANOWILLRULE "..I stopped being canon a long time ago."
@GenderbendMarcy "What do you know about food? You eat red."
"..So, feisty Marshall gets bumped down to 3rd ranking. New Marshall resumes second place and as always, French Marshall takes first."
@GenderbendMarcy "But, Marshall 3.. They are!"
"Actually, to my husband- @INSANOWILLRULE ~" 
"..Oreos in coffee is pretty delicious."
@DatIceKing "Haaaaaa. I'm already married. So."
@INSANOWILLRULE "He's tame. I apologize if I had any part in implying otherwise." Bonnibel admits she even has the dude on mute.
//It's time travel..so I was thinking.. If I were Komandr, I'd hook up with Bishop so I could kill Koriand'r every day .

@OriginalBubsRA "Ha. No really... Don't be public with my private biz." Airdrops many blankets and condoms.
@OriginalBubsRA "You're saying our pink love wasn't memorable?" Feigned pout. Now she's really forgotten where the electric blankets are.
@OriginalBubsRA "..I could~ But apparently, we had such raucous sex that my brains have fallen out. Whoopsie!"
@OriginalBubsRA "If my husband's ex..lover..whatever.. Cooked him dinner, I would just have to strangle her. Jeez."
"..I'm kidding. If she cooked him dinner, I'd finally be able to do that strangling thing... That @OriginalBubsRA said was okay to do."
@aromaticBayonet "..Yeah. That's cool and all...but you get the point."
// I'm kidding. I was tired of their Shit. Ok?

@aromaticBayonet - Diane, for example, offered to cook INSANO dinner." There would be rage.
@aromaticBayonet "..I..okay." She nodded some. "..But..that's normal. I mean..let's just be real here.. I would be very angry if a certain-
@OriginalBubsRA // as long as he consents
//What? It's 1:47 am and I find some messed up Shit disagreeable. Gtfo.

@aromaticBayonet "That's okay, too.. Because it's not about that. Its about loving the other person. Regardless of their love for you."
// The other night I dreamt Alanis Morisette confessed her love for me. Then we wrote a song together.
//Me:..I should hiatus. 
Other me: Nah. That's gonna cause more drama than if you just keep rping.
First me: sho yo right.
@aromaticBayonet "Never"
@aromaticBayonet She nodded quickly. "Indeed it is, Diane. Indeed it is."
@aromaticBayonet Bonnibel offered a shrug. "Well.. You can always try, right? I mean it's never too late."
@INSANOWILLRULE - cheeks. "..Well..I mean.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I..Uh.." She was getting nervous. Of course she was incredibly ready for him to have her. A soft blush pinkened at her-
@OriginalBubsRA @CrownOfDespair "It isn't you~"
@aromaticBayonet "Well..I think he just wanted mutual respect.. " She nodded some.
@aromaticBayonet - need to.. For closure."
@aromaticBayonet "..You need to just..tell him. I..really don't think beauty or sex or the physical is a factor. Just..tell him what you-
@aromaticBayonet - returned a brilliant smile.
@aromaticBayonet "Life is going to sting like salt in a wound but.. Diane, you can be so good. And..what you can be, you must me." She -
@MarshallBassGod // Oui. Et moi. Je suis fatigue. Je bois l'alcool.
@INSANOWILLRULE - another soft kiss against his. "That's a lot to have to explain..~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "If you keep grinning at me like that.. I'm just going to have to admit how much you make me melt.~" Her lips pressed -
@INSANOWILLRULE - interpret pain too well when it's resting, my love.." She beamed up at him.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..A coma dream..?" Her index and thumb grasped a bit of his forehead and pinched, softly. "..The brain doesn't really -
@aromaticBayonet "..Fear nothing, Diane.. Everything is beautiful.." Bonnibels heart raced. It was a phrase that resonated with her, deeply.
@INSANOWILLRULE - hers. Her warmth was soft, unobtrusive, as it flowed along him, enveloping him.
@INSANOWILLRULE "You can be amazing, my love.. And what you can be, you must be..~" She nuzzled into him, holding his body closer, against -
//..Adventure Time is all Buddhism..

"She's awesome and uber smarty."
"You can be a hero, cubert..and what a cube can be, he must be."

@aromaticBayonet "Love starts with acceptance. Accept your inner demons. Learn them. They're powerful. Beautiful. Strange. Unique."
@INSANOWILLRULE - you..and every second we share..I love you. I love.." Another soft wave of blush colored at her cheeks.
@INSANOWILLRULE She pressed a series of soft kisses along his chest. Her passion seemed to be bubbling just beneath her surface. "I love -
@aromaticBayonet - to do with what she would like.
@aromaticBayonet "So..don't die. Just..love yourself. You can't hide it, forever.." It was the truth. Pure, uncondensed.Laid out, for Diane-
@INSANOWILLRULE - this.. I just needed so much.. I needed the story, I needed life. The life you breathed into me."
@INSANOWILLRULE "Being with you has opened my eyes.." She bit into her lower lip, gently. "Opened my heart.. I needed you and I needed -
"All the things she said...running through my head. This is not enough.."
@INSANOWILLRULE - you know..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE - Her gaze rose to meet his. "..I don't know..I mean..maybe I just felt something that needed me, in there.. in your hearts-
@INSANOWILLRULE A soft coo escaped her. She loved him so very entirely.. "I've loved you since day one.. I can't help myself, sometimes.."-
@aromaticBayonet - you faster.."
@aromaticBayonet - to accept and love, yourself. Right..? I mean..to have to hide yourself from everyone ..forever..Well, it'll only kill-

@INSANOWILLRULE - his chest, tenderly. She was especially affectionate at present. Hormones or just a calm happiness?
@INSANOWILLRULE "Well... He -is- the hero, isn't he..?" A soft giggle spilled from her lips. "So..that's his job!" Her face nuzzled into -
@INSANOWILLRULE - concerned with an argument or drama, but.. Would things get a bit tense, she wondered? Hmm..

@aromaticBayonet "..You aren't hideous. You are just you. That's all that you can be. For a while I thought maybe..John didn't love as much-
@INSANOWILLRULE - Maybe it'll at least be a piece of home for you.. You know, to at least see something familiar?"

@INSANOWILLRULE - reflected back at her, in the form of his love for her, and she loved it all completely. Her body molded into his as she-
@INSANOWILLRULE "Oh, my love.." A deep exhale escaped her as she peered, softly, into his eyes. She could see her own love for him ·
@INSANOWILLRULE - important and I'm so happy that I am able to make you happy.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "I.." She was a bit taken aback by this. "You made me feel so good.. I mean, you always do, but.. That made me feel very-
@INSANOWILLRULE - teeth nipped at his shoulder, playfully.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..You're making me melt. I knew under that frail, angry exterior, a big puddle of marshmallow goo was just waiting." Her-
@INSANOWILLRULE - you didn't kill me.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Hey.. I'm so glad that..well.." A soft, pink colored at her cheeks. "..That you came here. But I'm even more happy that -
@INSANOWILLRULE "I just love that sweet charm~" She pursed her lips and nuzzled into his nose with her own. "More Eskimo kisses!"

@aromaticBayonet "..Yeah, well. Nobody can change that, but yourself. No amount of anything can change how you feel about yourself but you."
@aromaticBayonet "..oh haha~ you can't trick me.. " She just held onto Diane.

@aromaticBayonet "..Yeah..naked. And sexy. But again..not with me. Or uh...or INSANO John."
@aromaticBayonet "...Uh..I'd do something sexy. But not with me."

@aromaticBayonet - it didnt matter, she held the woman close.
@aromaticBayonet - Bonni pulled her close, and against Diane's shoulder, nodded. "..Anger bothers me regardless of whose it is.. I just.."-
@aromaticBayonet A shame her pain didn't occur before 1 am EST. After only 4 hours of sleep, 20 hours awake gets to be..rough. Anyway, -
@aromaticBayonet Well, of course she opened the door and embraced Diane. "Only when you're mad~"
@KichiroYoshiro She vomits. Morning sickness.
@KichiroYoshiro She punches herself right in the twins. "Stop eating me. I'm pregnant."

@TheAnt1_Chr1st //night
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Both arms slid around him and drew his body closer to hers. Almost immediately, she fell into a deep sleep.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st A little smile formed on her lips before she fell back, onto her bed. Glob..she was tired. "Come and lay with me, John.."
@aromaticBayonet //..it was in shrek?!?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - sexual...just let me hold you a little, ok..?" Her green gaze lifted to meet his.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She turned away from him, her arm sliding from around him to hook his hand in her own. "Come lay down with me.. Nothing-
@aromaticBayonet // 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - He smelled a lot like her John. Funny, that.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "I'm sorry..again. I know what it's like..to love someone. And not measure up and be enough.." Her face pressed into him.-
@aromaticBayonet // "the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I ever had.."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - closer, holding him, gently.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "..I can hold you for a little bit..I mean. Who hasn't needed that before..?" With her arm around him, she drew him a bit-
@aromaticBayonet// Shit...
@aromaticBayonet // But I made it sound deep~
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - or marriages. Nobody's ever jilted..nobody has a reason to be. You know..?"
@TheAnt1_Chr1st "Welcome to Ooo.. And what I suppose I mean by that is..not a lot of people here subscribe to...traditional relationships -
@aromaticBayonet //- she's disappointing anyone, every day.
@aromaticBayonet //- traditional relationship. She needs her freedom. That's why you feel good. You're like wow..now Diane won't feel like-
@aromaticBayonet // look..i,get it. Here's what it was.. Diane is literally a free spirit. She cant stick to rigid guidelines formed by a-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st - after 800 years of having sex with Marceline and candy people, you'll find there has been no emotional investment."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She gave a gentle nod and very slowly slid an arm around him, drawing him close. "Yeah...I know exactly what you mean. But,-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She held her gaze on the horizon, where candy shingle rooftops met the sapphire sky, dotted with stars. "..Sorry."
@aromaticBayonet // Pffft. Pb isn't a slut. She's picky. Just..sometimes you gotta do the damn thing. A lot.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ...She'll humor him. Diane's anger scares her. "Uh...hi." Bonni nudged him, gently. "..Found a zombie."
@ScitzoTerra // I'll have all the baby bunnies! So sweet .
@aromaticBayonet // no, dude..make her do lots of sex. Do sex instead of anger.~
@ScitzoTerra // yay

@aromaticBayonet // Jealous..? She can't just overtake them..? With charm and sexuality..?
@aromaticBayonet // Bro. There are so many robins @ my ivy. Take em all~
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I..suppose." She nods some. "But..right now.. I just want you. Okay, my love..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE - wasn't it..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE - have your own husband say he's okay..with..You..er...lightly cheating..on him...with...himself. That was asinine, -
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Okay.. Thanks. I appreciate that..I mean.. I do..like him. He is you.. You are him.. But it's a little..offputting to -
@aromaticBayonet // Noted~ For the longest, I thought you didn't..I was like..we could play with that Robin together~
@INSANOWILLRULE She smiles a bit and presses a soft kiss to his lips. "I don't want him~"
@aromaticBayonet // Because you never followed Ivy back~ I thought they'd be hot together..
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I.. Uh. This is a little..uhm. Maybe later."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Mm. A taste..~. You're so fucking hot. I mean you you. Not him, you. Him, too, but.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..uh... What? I'm confused about what you just said.. Elaborate."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Well.. I mean, he is you, So.. I could see why~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Oh. You aren't KY jealous are you..? I like to think you have the sweet and spicy one~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "I mean..sometimes vines just come out of nowhere to shield me from things...I think I'm a water type Pokemon~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "...He has Ptsd...?" Clearly she was very confused.
"Zombies dumfound me, too."
@INSANOWILLRULE "A zombie, right?!"
No longer blinded, she exclaims, "Cool. Rock on!"
@T0xic0dendr0n "..yeah~"

@TheLivelyDeadH - Pep for anything you may desire... Ok..?"
@TheLivelyDeadH "..Well..I'm sort of..exhausted, I've had a...really really messed up week." She nodded some. "So please feel free to ask-
@TheLivelyDeadH "..hmmm.. Okay..I guess that's as good as anything so far. Hungry, Harry Herbert..?" She peered up at him, curiously.
//Eeyup. 
@TheLivelyDeadH - "..What is your name..?"
@TheLivelyDeadH "..Not the water outside. Never -that- water." She took the glass from Pep and offered it to Human. Which reminded her..-
@TheLivelyDeadH She gestured for Pep, who promptly offered a glass of water,to the human. "Here..drink. Calm. Breathe."
@TheLivelyDeadH - It would be a little easier if you had someone left.." She knelt down beside him.
@TheLivelyDeadH "..But..that's .. Yeah. I was pretty unsure if you wanted to be alive again. Especially, so far into the future.. I'm sorry-
@TheLivelyDeadH - else's..and that's what you were supposed to do. Victory isn't ever guaranteed."
@TheLivelyDeadH "..Yeah.. And sometimes that happens. But.. You fulfilled your piece of the mission. Your piece interlocked with someone -
@TheLivelyDeadH - down..You served the mission. That's all that matters."
@TheLivelyDeadH She blinked. That's probably the end of the story. "..You were KIA..?" A deep sigh escaped her. "You..didn't let anybody -
@TheLivelyDeadH - water.
@TheLivelyDeadH "..The..war?" She was just as confused as he was. "Calm down.. What war..?? The Great Mushroom War?" He clearly needs some-
@TheLivelyDeadH - the rainicorns~"
@TheLivelyDeadH "You already said that part; Hello, one of three humans." She offered him a slight smile. "You're now a rare delicacy for-
@TheLivelyDeadH "Look at you~" A proud, motherly glow resonated with her.. "My little Zombaby is growing into a man..!"
@TheLivelyDeadH - sink into his nooks and crannies.
@TheLivelyDeadH "Ha! Okay..Okay..." With vial raised above his head, she slowly overturned it, allowing the Decorpsinator Serum to really -
@TheLivelyDeadH - person...hmmm."
@TheLivelyDeadH "Well..ok." Within minutes of leaving, she had returned, vial of liquid in hand. "Not sure how much I'm sposta use on a -
@TheLivelyDeadH - Good times.. Why, if I didn't have Science resting in her cage..whoo~!"
@TheLivelyDeadH - a zombie problem..occasionally..when I really donk things up. Was a zombie for a minute, myself once... Ha. Good times. -
@TheLivelyDeadH "..Oh~ You wanna live again.. That's ..probably doable. Probably more doable than you realize, actually. We..sort of have-
@TheLivelyDeadH She hummed, softly. Time must be a surreal concept for him. "You seem..underwhelmed."
@TheAnt1_Chr1st //It's actually..uh.. Pretty mind opening if you drink it responsibly.
@TheLivelyDeadH - take this..? "That was easily a thousand years ago..so.. Heh.. Welcome to 3050."
@TheLivelyDeadH "..The Great Mushroom War destroyed the world in 2047.. That was.." She bit into her lip, nervously. How was he going to -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st //*absinthe ;)
@TheLivelyDeadH - so much since then.."
@TheLivelyDeadH "No..ocean. Surrounded by..ice. So far, we'r-- Oh. You're from a city that once existed there.. But, the Earth has changed-
@TheLivelyDeadH - to the cotton candy trees. "This is here..Candy Kingdom. My kingdom."  Her eyes searched his for some understanding.
@TheLivelyDeadH She bit into her lip and very gently shook her head. "..No cities there. Just..ocean." Her hand grasped his and guided it -
@TheLivelyDeadH - From the same pocket, she withdrew her map of Ooo. 
@TheLivelyDeadH "..aaaamericaaa. Oh. Uhm.." A little sigh escaped her. "So..you've been dead for a bit longer than you may have wanted."-
@TheLivelyDeadH - studied him for a moment.. "You need a change of clothes and a bath. You look like a wizard."
@TheLivelyDeadH A little chuckle escaped her. "Sorry..I know what that means. Same in every language." She tucked the light away and -
@TheLivelyDeadH - pocket and squinted as she shined it into his eyes. "..Maybe if you could just..not be so dead.."
@TheLivelyDeadH "I really wish I could understand whatever was going on in that head of your's.." She withdrew a small flashlight from her-
@TheLivelyDeadH - aren't many of those around here.."
@TheLivelyDeadH A slight frown formed against her lips. "..Candy zombies eat candy people..human zombies eat humans.. Unfortunately.. There-
@TheLivelyDeadH - bothered her, a bit.
@TheLivelyDeadH - one of those unfortunate things for you to hear, but..There's pretty much just this continent of..Ooo." Ouch. That even-
@TheLivelyDeadH She winced. She wondered if that was hard for him to say as it was for her to listen to. "So. Ok. A city. Well..this may be-
@TheLivelyDeadH -..er..since.. You..uh..right. Your physical and ..spiritual..uh.." This was a bit harder to explain delicately.
@TheLivelyDeadH She gasped! "Hello.. My name is Bonnibel.. You are in the Candy Kingdom. It's..Well, there's been quite a bit of change -
@TheLivelyDeadH - groans mean? "..I think I still have a very faint pul-- oh... Right. Candy. Heh." A nervous laugh escaped her.
@TheLivelyDeadH "You..wait..hungry..? I don't suppose you eat food.." She hummed. He's speaking gibberish, how would she know what his -
@TheLivelyDeadH - back into that pit..blech.." She gestured for the undead to enter. "Also..most of the ..er..zombies here eat candy."
@TheLivelyDeadH "..I..I'm sorry, I just..thought you were..Chris." Her voice lowered as she mumbled; "I was afraid I'd have to throw you-
@TheLivelyDeadH - feigning some bravery.. She opened them, in a grand and sweeping gesture. He was ..quite hard to look at.
@TheLivelyDeadH "..Okay. Breathe...breathe...you're an emissary of peace for all..okay." Pink hands grasped both of the French doors, and-
@TheLivelyDeadH - the door. "...JOHN! Oh Glob. Its..a..it's a fucking..."
@TheLivelyDeadH ฯ Slowly opening it, to see... Glob. "..Ch..Chris..?" No.. Not him.. But..  A loud shriek echoed from her as she slammed -
@INSANOWILLRULE - my love..?" Her pink brows raised in curiosity, but, before he could answer, she raced to the door..Г
@INSANOWILLRULE The resounding echo of the knock caused her to spin around, facing the source of the noise. "..Are..you expecting anyone-
@TheLivelyDeadH Let's..just say she hoped it wasn't Chris..
// My son using a silencer to teach that asshole Oreo not to fuck around. 
@INSANOWILLRULE - impressed itself against her cheeks. So this is love...mmmm. So this is love..Mmm. So this is what makes life divine~
@INSANOWILLRULE - off and pulled him closer. "I love feeling how warm you've become..I just..love feeling..you." A soft pink color -
@INSANOWILLRULE Suddenly..she felt a disturbance in the Force. Was it..an onslaught of zombies from Ooo's crater? Who knows. She waved it-
//..Writer will be moody and antagonistic today. 9 am minus 5 am equals 4 hours of sleep.
@Marshredblood @_SilverDust_ "See ya"
@INSANOWILLRULE - green emeralds that were now completely filled with love.
@INSANOWILLRULE She held her body against his. "I don't want you to ever leave...Is..that okay..?" Her gaze lifted to meet his. Those sweet-
@_SilverDust_ @Marshredblood "Same."
@_SilverDust_ @Marshredblood "..Yeah..deathlessbros..he's on my shit list , too~"
@_SilverDust_ @HopeOfOoo // it's true. I blocked him Because that's ridiculously misogynistic. Good RP tho. Just..delinquent writer.

@_SilverDust_ @Marshredblood "...This is the shittiest form of attention bait~ Have some attention~"
// Lewd accounts.. 
@INSANOWILLRULE - Tenderly, she pressed a kiss into his chest. "I love you. The entirety of you..every nuance and proclivity."
@INSANOWILLRULE - strength, hope, and love that echoes between each thump, not merely a pause of silence. "..But the sounds are the same.."-
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I have but one heart.." She nuzzled into his chest, listening to multiple hearts beat, resilient against doubt. That's -
@INSANOWILLRULE -now..would just leave me..with gaps. To take you back..would mean.."
@INSANOWILLRULE Her face pressed into chest, and as she spoke, her voice was muffled;"They're all key players in my life..To take them back-
@aromaticBayonet "...Yeah..it always is.." She drew Diane a little closer, and sighed, herself.

"I'm losing something."

"..Myself? No."

"..It's becoming very clear that I needed @INSANOWILLRULE as much as he needed me."
@aromaticBayonet "I'm fine..excuse my selfishness, but.. I just need to be held. For a little. I'm feeling all too exposed and unshielded."
@aromaticBayonet "..Okay. Well..."

"If I never held you, I would never have a clue, how at last I'd find in you, the missing part of me..~"
"..If I never knew you.. I would spend my whole life through.. Lost forever."

@aromaticBayonet "..You've exhausted me.." Is all she could really say.. "What is this about, Diane..? I want to know your earnest feelings-

@MarshRockStar She offered him a slight shrug. "..Nah. It isn't. I'm really donking things up."

@aromaticBayonet - fell asleep beside the table, to pick up her plans in the morning.
@aromaticBayonet - reaching her home, and then her Bio lab. Bonnibel..decided to strap the suicidal Diane to an examination table. She soon-
@aromaticBayonet - not saying stupid shit, she actually started feeling a little better. Every now and again, she stopped for a break, soon-
As the Candy Queen carried the crazy, @aromaticBayonet , through the field separating the bar and her home, she noticed.. With Diane -
@aromaticBayonet Still, peebles carried that knocked out bitch home. Know why? Because. She's the fucking hero. *drops Mic*
@aromaticBayonet - heart in her right hand, and supporting herself.. She began the painstaking hike to the Palace.
@aromaticBayonet - muttered.. "Didn't they tell you..?" She panted, softly, "..I'm the hero.." With Diane on her shoulders, a badly damaged-
@aromaticBayonet - a hard trek back home.. 1..2..3.. A groan escaped her as she lifted the body from the ground. Through gritted teeth, she-
@aromaticBayonet - Diane, and pulled her forcefully across her own shoulders.. Her own pregnant body and Diane's weight..it was going to be-
@aromaticBayonet Bonnibel glared. "..Why would you...ever think that..?" A soft frown formed against her lips as she knelt just behind the -
@aromaticBayonet "..I'm TRYING TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER, DIANE!"
@aromaticBayonet - -metaphor-.. If you really want to stop loving so badly.. You'd have to pull out your own brain." She groaned.
@aromaticBayonet - of lovers dying because..oh glob. That's fucking right. I'm made of bubblegum. Here's the kicker.. The heart is a -
@aromaticBayonet She threw a pink hand up. "Nil. Let me just stop you right there. Hundreds..? Try 9. As in 900. As in almost a millenium -
@aromaticBayonet - of a freaking heart?"
@aromaticBayonet - What in the fuck are you even thinking? ARE you even thinking? Who globbin knows anymore?! Why would you rob yourself-
@aromaticBayonet - She was furious! "OH. ONE GUY..ONE FREAKING GUY DECIDES TO JILT YOU AND YOU FREAKING DO THIS..Diane..Globbin Donks..-
@aromaticBayonet "..No.. But why..?! Why would you do that..?!" Very quickly, she snatched the remnants of the heart from Diane's hand.-
@aromaticBayonet - back together."
@aromaticBayonet - love again, Diane.. It's not the end of the world when a person breaks your heart. You...just have to glue the pieces -
@aromaticBayonet "...Yes." She reached out, her hands cupped, ready to receive the bloody, pulsating organ. "Yeah. I am going to make you -
@aromaticBayonet -sprint. Instead, she turned her head, wincing. "..No.. No, I don't Diane..but I can make you the other half if you want.."
@aromaticBayonet This left no room to evade..she had backed herself against the outside wall of the bar..not close enough to the door to -
@aromaticBayonet "..I...I see...I.." She began taking a few steps backward. "..think you need to calm down.."
@aromaticBayonet She nodded.. "..Consider your knight's feelings in all of this rage.."
@aromaticBayonet - because .. This person can care for him better and truly loves him, too.. But I should also hope that..he tells me.."
@aromaticBayonet - meaningful love..that breaks him.. And not meaningless sex. I should hope that whatever trespass he commits..he does -
@aromaticBayonet She held out her arms, to once again embrace Diane. "..Then..while I would not be happy.. I should hope that it is -
@aromaticBayonet - understand that you never received closure.. But.. To imply that I'm low, or that he's lying to me.. Cheating on me.."
@aromaticBayonet "..Low..? I'm low..? I'm really someone you would consider Low..? Really...?" She was clearly very irritated. "I -
@aromaticBayonet - say "Loving INSANO has made me a better person.." Then... Oh glob.." She just realized.. "..You still love INSANO.."
@aromaticBayonet - ..He is just him. That's who I loved. Love is hard. But..when you love someone, you are impacted. If you can honestly -
@aromaticBayonet - who to love or how.. I just.. Don't want you to think.. That I wanted some sort of ownership over him. He isn't property-
@aromaticBayonet ...She knows! She regrets it being on such bad terms.. "..I.. I love John. I cannot tell you or him or Lantern or Dylan -
@aromaticBayonet - every moment of that.."
@aromaticBayonet - kiss... Making love. Watching his plots be foiled. Saving him... Being his hero..." She frowned. "His insanity.. I love -
@aromaticBayonet "..I don't...But ..  But the journey, the feelings that developed from natural chemistry.. Our sheepish and awkward first-
@aromaticBayonet There was a moment of silence that elapsed, before she muttered.. "But...our baby.."
@aromaticBayonet "...Wait. What...? What do you mean..?"
@aromaticBayonet - just want..everyone to be a part of my life. Happily."
@aromaticBayonet - She groaned. The stress was just so much. "If things are ok with INSANO, things are horrible with Lantern and Dylan..I-
@aromaticBayonet A deep exhale escaped her. "..I just.. Want it to be normal for five minutes.. I am just so confused about everything." -
@aromaticBayonet "Nothing is logical anymore.."
"Love of mine, some day you will die..But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark.."
@aromaticBayonet - going back in time and just shooting at whatever you people came here in, or just jumping off a bridge."
@aromaticBayonet "Yeah..I'm less concerned about that, more concerned about..interpersonal relationships. I'm honestly thinking about -
@aromaticBayonet "Wait. Wait. Wait. What pressure..? There's more going on here..?"
@aromaticBayonet "..No.. I wouldn't be happier with you dead."
@aromaticBayonet - universes, dimensions but...maybe the story of our lives were..just..written incorrectly. Or maybe it's me."
@aromaticBayonet - heart beats for him, so hard.. Is..is here where everyone should be..? I haven't had the pleasure of traveling -
@aromaticBayonet - life has been..skewed.  Problematic for you, the lantern, Dylan.. I loved John...er..Insano, from the beginning. My -
@aromaticBayonet - that I am to blame..for this. Everybody doesn't hate you.. Nobody does. Listen.. Ever since John stepped into Ooo..-
@aromaticBayonet A deep sigh escapes her as she holds Diane tighter, drawing her closer against her own body, warm and relaxing. "I...feel -
@Bonnibel_Peebs - would not be a source of pain..for John, John, Dylan..or Diane. Maybe..if I just stopped existing." She nodded.
"..I would miss them all, but..if I just..prevented any of them from coming here... They would all be in their proper places and...I -
@aromaticBayonet Bonnibel slid her arms around Diane and held her, tightly. "Shh..Shh..I'm sorry.."

@INSANOWILLRULE She wondered.. "Have you met the Prince of Candy Kingdom..?" She was curious.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Blegh~ Not him. He's ...a ... Not smart guy. Who bakes horribly~"
@cupcakePlanner She hummed. "More oddballs in the Kingdom~!"

@VampireKingAaa "..Probably left you because you're a fucking cunt."
@INSANOWILLRULE A soft pink hue colored at her cheeks. She was blushing. "..You're my entirety.."
@VampireKingAaa "That makes the meaning behind what you say less earnest."
@VampireKingAaa "..You don't speak from the heart for selfish motives. That sort of taints the meaning."
@INSANOWILLRULE - only helped you open the lock..it was a little rusty.."

@INSANOWILLRULE - those people. I was just..waiting for you to accept it.. And I, too, love you the purest."

@_Mad_Jasper_Gem Of course she joined the Orange Ocelot! "What's up..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE - indulge in her, in her sensitivities, her taste. Her body radiated a hot sensuality into him. "I'm melting..."

@INSANOWILLRULE "..J-..John..!" She buried herself into his chest once more. This time, she was attempting to evade her own sensitivity and-
@DatIceKing "..I..Well, no Ice King. Heh. Give me another year or so!"
@INSANOWILLRULE - draw herself closer, still.
@INSANOWILLRULE - her face buried into him. Involuntarily, her body arched into his, an attempt to evade his nips into her neck, and to -
@INSANOWILLRULE Oh..oh! If he did that, she would surely lose all control. Her breaths became sharp, excited pants against his chest, as -
@INSANOWILLRULE - excitement, up at him.
@INSANOWILLRULE Her voice was a soft whisper against his lips, "..You make me so, very, hot and melty~" A soft, pallid gaze flickered with-
@INSANOWILLRULE - excitement, for him. "..Oh, Glob."
@INSANOWILLRULE - hands grasped into his hips a bit more firmly, and drew him just a bit closer into her. Her heart raced with the rush of-
@INSANOWILLRULE She cooed, softly, against his lips, into their tender kiss. He seems to be reading her signals quite easily today. Her -
//...Socc him. Love it~ I am cracking up.

@INSANOWILLRULE Oh, indeed~ His fingers, as they traced along her curvature, left a wake of searing heat against her body. It had caused a-
"Love takes time.. Love takes work."
@INSANOWILLRULE She grasped him, pulled his body closer, into her, gently. This caused a surge of heat, for her, and a soft-pink blush.
"..Is this true, I wonder..?" 
@INSANOWILLRULE "Ooh~ Agreed..!" She bit into her lip and slid her fingertips down along his hips.

@SexyMerc @DeathStrxke // Well, I have Ivy now..she's hot. Hot hot hot. Humid. I have you added on her.
@SexyMerc @DeathStrxke //..That awkward moment when like 5 Deadpools follow your Ivy account..
@SexyMerc // ..~~~ You see me, or you see Ivy..?
@MarshallBassGod "C'est sombre beaucoup."
@MarshallBassGod "Oui, monsieur."
@SexyMerc // no you dont..!

@JamieMailman 
@JamieMailman // I already know. It's okay.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Jooooooohn...~"
"..Oh..I..suppose he didn't want to..~?"
@INSANOWILLRULE She frees herself from the rest of her clothes, exposing her pink nakedness, slight baby bump and all~
@INSANOWILLRULE She follows, of course, excitedly and quite warm~
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Please..? Now..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "..No..I mean really..can we take a shower or something..?" She bit into her lip, gently.
Shadow POPS OUT FROM BEHIND A FUCKING TREE: TOASTY!
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Glob..can you just..hose me down or something..? It's so hot..~"
@INSANOWILLRULE Lol I mean..okay..She drops her clothes onto the floor. Glob..it is getting hot.
@INSANOWILLRULE Yeah~
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem // Pffft. I did. But I'm done.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I'm sorry..?" She frowned and grabbed at her clothes, gathering them.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem//*drinks...gags* lol gags auto corrected to gays

@INSANOWILLRULE "..I'm...I'm okay. I'm..just gonna.." She begins easing off her clothes.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem // HAHAHAHAHA. OK..now..for the next half.
@INSANOWILLRULE "...so..,"
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem // if liquor tasted like penis I'd be ok.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I..I'm sorry..I..yeah..heh."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem //..I got half the shot down...
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem @Optimistic_Gon // omg..be my spotter..
@INSANOWILLRULE A little shiver ran through her. "..Ah...nothing..warm?"
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem @Optimistic_Gon // I'm gonna go with..¿ 
// I have NO selina Kyle following my poison ivy..and just one harlequin. Step that game up..

@INSANOWILLRULE She hummed softly. "Sounds suspect, babe..!"
//back: whatcha runnin from baby..? Me:*giggle* doesn't matter, I'm running to you..*takes shot*
@INSANOWILLRULE "Well...sounds as if you were playing poker with statues..~ and lost..Hm.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Oh! I see..Hm.."
// Mr. Daniels, this is sudden..and my appetites are far greater than for which you can provide~
@INSANOWILLRULE She gagged. "Yick...gross.."
//..Oh..! Mr. Daniels..*blush* just one taste..?
@SexyMerc //&lt;3
@INSANOWILLRULE "I'd believe it, dear. You were fighting them..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Sounds like a bayou thing. Didn't get caught in the knife storm did you..?" 
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem She shook her head. "Never, Orange Oeclot."
@INSANOWILLRULE "What uh..what happened..?"
@SexyMerc "Youre..//// You're part of the network that keeps me balanced. I lean on you.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..No, it's fine." She chuckled a little.
@INSANOWILLRULE You are a villain.
//*Tegan pops and locks to Marshall Mathers.*
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Hm..? No, I villainize myself I think.."
Bonnibel raises a closed fist for Deadpool. "Solidarity..."
@SexyMerc - you.."
@SexyMerc "..I meant about ourselves. It seems we tweeps are just feeling it right now. But honestly,..a little piece of me is going with -
@ThatJohnWriter // ...uh. I'm ok dude..
"..Same.., Deadpool..A lot of us can agree." 
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Yeah, huh..?" Her brows furrowed some. She held on, longer. Tighter.
@ThatJohnWriter // &gt;_&gt;
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..It doesn't matter, I suppose.."
@ThatJohnWriter // &gt;.&gt;
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem She nods some, gently even..
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "Nah...I just gotta talk it out with him. I hate holding it in."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Eeeeeeeeeeh. I donno. Just seems ..right."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..No. He appreciates me.. I think the problem is on my end."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "Nah; I make him leave when really I just don't want him to know that I really just feel vulnerable and need him the most."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "I am beginning to think I do more harm for him, than good." A thin sheen formed against her eyes as she held tighter.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "...Wherever is John, I wonder.." A sigh, deep, and exasperated, escaped her. "Either way..,this is appreciated."
@TheHugFairy She also embraced the hug fairy.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Yeah.." She nodded and held onto the Gem, tightly. "Exactly, friend."
@BillCiDemonGuy ..."I was not ...no. I'm saying..ugh..nevermind."
A soft hum emanated from her.. "I need a hug.."
// I sorta..miss being an rp nobody. A peebles account..where when I post #OpenRP , I don't attract weirdos for sex.
//*puts cipher in name..gains 4 bills and a Dylan.* 
"..I just need release."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem // berb..shower.
Bonnibel needs rejuvenation.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Let's just chat over coffee. I'm not up to that physical activity right now."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Yeah. Okay. You know what. Yeah. Let's go do something."
// I'd hiatus from RP, but like..800 of you don't follow my @Kona_taku

@BillCiDemonGuy @INSANOWILLRULE - out of her way. "Keep prattling on. I'm certain someone wants the discourse.." She left.
@BillCiDemonGuy @INSANOWILLRULE "..I don't wait.." Her palm pressed firmly into one of the pyramid's face, and she gave him a hard shove, -
@BillCiDemonGuy @INSANOWILLRULE "Okay. So..? I'm waiting."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Eh..forget it. I need some down time."
Whatever, guy~
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Sounds good. I've been wanting to go bowling. For a while. Actually."
@BillCiDemonGuy @INSANOWILLRULE "Go away. You've been following me all day you lonely pyramid."
@BillCiDemonGuy @INSANOWILLRULE "This is juvenile. Juvenile. Why can't I have my temper tantrum in peace..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "Okay.." She nods some.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Isn't that kind of weird..? I'm pretty, I'm charismatic, I'm rich, I have power..what should I ever be jealous of...? "
@INSANOWILLRULE "..You shouldn't be jealous of anything.. My heart is solely in your hands."
@INSANOWILLRULE She exhaled, deeply. "..You know. It's hard. Very hard. But I won't. I will..stop."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Hmmm. How to phrase this..? Probably everyone."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..What's up, babe..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "Excuse me, I believe your dad is killing me now..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Mhm~"
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Donno..it's a character flaw."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Ah..well..she's good as new now, I suppose."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "I'm super jealous."
@BillCiDemonGuy "...Excuse my apathy. My disdain for Power Girl far outweighs my genuine care about this very topic."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem Bonnibel exhaled deeply into the embrace. "..Thanks."
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded some.. "Lantern-John..? Yeah..funny that..uh., Diane approached me for medical care.."
@BillCiDemonGuy "I don't follow."
@BillCiDemonGuy "...I don't care."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Pffft. Whatevs. Have fun..?"
@BillCiDemonGuy "..Mhm. Yep."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Mhm. Yep."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Mhm. Yep."
@BillCiDemonGuy "...Hm. Anyway. What is it you want from me, exactly..?"
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "..Yep."
@BillCiDemonGuy "Why are you giving me more attention than my spouse..~?"
"...Ugh."
@BillCiDemonGuy @PeriNerd A DEEP EXHALE ESCAPED HER. "Bill..."
"..So...Wonder where John went.."
//...This is going to be strange..~ flipping back and forth between Jesus and Betty Paige..
"..I...I'm sorta ..glad my hair doesn't stick to things. No offense.. You have lovely hair."

@BillCiDemonGuy "..Uh, let's see..I'm ..yes. Everything. Minus resolution for my character flaws, but those are purely driven by my id. "
// Doodles~ 
@BillCiDemonGuy "I have -everything- I could possibly want~" She beamed up at him.

"..I'm such a sappy sap sap...mush."
"..I just can't wait to see the person you are together."
@Takumi_NSRP "Not exactly...No." She shook her head some. "Someone else..I feel there is something amiss."
@Takumi_NSRP She shared the gentle sigh with him.. "Just that pins and needles feeling, I suppose."
@Takumi_NSRP "If,..it's any consolation, I also have a feeling of impending doom burdening me..for some reason.."
@Takumi_NSRP "...Ooooooohh, ok. Heh..I'm Sorry about that."
@Takumi_NSRP "..I have no idea what you're referencing."
@Takumi_NSRP "...Ah...I see."
@Takumi_NSRP "..what's wrong?"

@ImReportingThis "..I used that line on @INSANOWILLRULE once!"
// My Poison Ivy; @T0xic0dendr0n . There is no OOC chatter.
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem A tender giggle spilled from her. "Indeed it is quite unique, Jasper."
@_Mad_Jasper_Gem "Glob, JASPER! Get in here!" She held the door open for the Gem.

@aromaticBayonet "..You seriously underestimate either John's capacity to love. He couldn't leave you. Who, then, would he dedicate his own-
@aromaticBayonet - But..he isn't. I couldn't.. I love him much too much to let him decay into himself, Diane."
@aromaticBayonet "No..it's not the insanity that drives anyone away. I mean, if that were the case...John...INSANO..would be abandoned.-
@nightmarishOrzo // YOU GOT SUCKED IN
@aromaticBayonet - not want me to beckon to your Lantern.. Nor would you want to drive him away, yourself."
@aromaticBayonet "...I don't want you to take my John. More than that, I don't want my own actions to take him, either, Diane. You would -
"..Because my expiration date rivals yours..and that's a very long time to be at war."
@aromaticBayonet - She mumbled..
@aromaticBayonet The pink queen nodded gently.. "...You should leave now. I advise against seeking John out while you are in my home." -
"...Please let him realize there was nothing indecent about that." An exasperated sigh escaped her.
@aromaticBayonet "I'm sorry, I was just nurturing. It was purely innocent." She released Diane from their hug.
@aromaticBayonet "I apologize..it was just. An, embrace."
@BillCiDemonGuy "Watch The Labyrinth..."
@aromaticBayonet **loom
@aromaticBayonet - coldness that seemed to look around Diane..and replace it with some of her own loving warmth.
@aromaticBayonet - heart thumping. "..If I warm you just a little, you won't be so cold.. " She nodded. She would take in some of that dark-
@aromaticBayonet Her arms held Diane close, pulling her against her own chest, and allowing her to hear, if she could, the candy queen's -
@aromaticBayonet - you now, for a little.."
@aromaticBayonet "...I sometimes worry..--No. It's nothing.." She feigned a smile and drew the woman close, holding her. "I'm going to hold-
@aromaticBayonet "..Physically..or emotionally..?" She was peering into Diane, now, reading her.
@aromaticBayonet - to,ensure no tenderness, or heat. "..Does that hurt, Diane..?"
@aromaticBayonet Her pink fingers pressed on the flesh, it had fully formed, healed..like magic, but science. She was palpating the area, -
@aromaticBayonet - began to heal, from the inside out, weaving and threading itself together. "Good as new..just give it a minute.."
@aromaticBayonet - little now, but..anyway, liquid flowed from the flask, into the pallid lady's open wound. Almost immediately, the skin-
@aromaticBayonet - "Diane.." Her own green and pallid gaze poured into Diane's.. "You terrify me.." Even the pink queen was trembling a -
@aromaticBayonet - life... I guess it's what I'm meant to do.." She brushed the blood on her green pant leg and uncorked the bottle. -
@aromaticBayonet A soft, bubblegum scented thumb reached up and brushed the blood from Diane's lips. "..It's your life, isn't it..? I make-
@aromaticBayonet - still clutching her hand. Her free hand reached up and grabbed at an unmarked bottle. ~Secret recipe~
@aromaticBayonet "..You know what..just lie down..I'm going to do this here.." She eased the cupcake queen down, into the floor of a lab,-
@aromaticBayonet - reached out to take her hand..
@aromaticBayonet She winced at those words; lost another child. She could empathize. "Yeah..Yeah, I can do something, I think..." Bonnibel-
@aromaticBayonet She turned..and looked up at the bloodied woman, clearly a mess.. She was taken aback. "..I...I felt something amiss.."
"..That is pretty dumb of me.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..It's stupid..I know.."
@INSANOWILLRULE - okay..?" Those words sounded so juvenile to her.
@INSANOWILLRULE - once more.. "..And you let that bad have some of you..and then..it's not so bad anymore..and you give it back as good, -
@INSANOWILLRULE Her voice was a soft whisper, "..You don't say anything..you feel..and, you absorb all the bad.." She was beginning to tear-
@MarshallBassGod - it had seemed.
@MarshallBassGod - they..?" It seemed she had calmed down long enough to think on the matter of specifications. She had almost spaced out, -
@MarshallBassGod - around, frantically. "C..Can I hide here? He said something about those Flame Tigers..Wolves...something...what were-
@MarshallBassGod "Glob Marshall! The flipping Flame Prince almost melted me into high fructose corn syrup and marble dust!" She looked -
@MarshallBassGod - "Glob, Marshall!" Her voice was frantic, her breaths were hastened. She was frightened.
@MarshallBassGod Frantic knocking was heard . Her small pink fists were drumming against his door, loudly. Well, as loudly as she could. -
@MarshallBassGod //*raises hand*
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded against his chest and held him closer still. Maybe it was a universal sense of unrest.
@INSANOWILLRULE - pulling her. Emotionally guiding her. Women's intuition..?
@INSANOWILLRULE She held on. The magnitude of her empathy rivaled most finite values..and some infinite values as well. Something..was -
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded and held him tighter still. "Yeah.."
@INSANOWILLRULE - held him, firmly against her. She was cradling him, holding him.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I'm sorry..something in the universe is guiding me.." She quickly drew him closer, into a warmer, tighter embrace, and -
// &gt;_&gt;..Okay. Maybe a little more French, later.
@INSANOWILLRULE - another kiss against him.
@INSANOWILLRULE Man..if he only knew. "Much like those sweet eccentricities of yours that I love so much..eggplants." Her lips pressed -
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Nah..my flaws are just hidden in plain sight.." She offered him a small smile. It was true, really..
@INSANOWILLRULE "Hey.. You really don't think you impress me..?" Her eyes peered up at him, inquisitively.
@INSANOWILLRULE @Ahziidal @KonLegendary @Broflamingo // apparently her nose is huge, tho...
@INSANOWILLRULE She reached out and, upon drawing him nearer to her, pressed a soft kiss against his lips.
// NO MOAR FRENCH IT IS,ENTIRELY,TOOCHARMING. :)
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded some. "I know you do, my love.."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..No..no..no..I..just feel like, sometimes when I say things, nobody is listening.."
@INSANOWILLRULE - whelming for her. Her eyes began to water..
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Oh! I guess I just didnt expect you to.." care? "..to react that way. Nobody ever does.." This was emotionally over-
@INSANOWILLRULE She frowned some. She didn't quite understand. "I don't know what's going on.."
@Ahziidal @KonLegendary @Broflamingo//- woulda just shut the fuck up and stopped talking at me..I would not have reported you.Run that mouth
@Ahziidal @KonLegendary @Broflamingo // Yeah...I still dont care. I didn't 5 minutes ago. I don't now. And here's the awesome part. If you-
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I...I'm sorry? I didn't mean to uh..mess you up there."
@Ahziidal @KonLegendary @Broflamingo // Right..I said not to talk at me..so, I'm just gonna...yeah.
@INSANOWILLRULE "Well..I love you, three~ You impress me, every day."
@Ahziidal @KonLegendary @Broflamingo // yeah I'm just...uh...gonna...don't talk at me again.
@DementedMuscle "Et moi! Et moi!"
@KonLegendary //*just unfollow now...*
@KonLegendary @Ahziidal @Broflamingo // why you say I'm blocking people..?
@KonLegendary @Broflamingo @Ahziidal // Lol..no. But imma block your ass~
@KonLegendary @Broflamingo @Ahziidal // Ian, you involved in some nudes crap?
@KonLegendary @Broflamingo @Ahziidal // uhm. Wtf. This is juvenile as shit.
@INSANOWILLRULE "..I...yes. It is, my love."
@INSANOWILLRULE "I was asking.. Nothing should. I love you. You love me." She nods, gently.
@INSANOWILLRULE "...Is this honesty or shielding me from the honesty..?" She frowned a little.
@DementedMuscle She giggled.. "Non."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..You..are..feeling..threatened..? A little..?" She hoped for some honesty.
"..C'est bonne.. Il est tres beau.." Is that right..? She doesn't know.
@INSANOWILLRULE - you to feel threatened by any other force, however..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE Okay..she giggled once more. "You are entirely too charming.. I feel special that you are vying for me.. I wouldn't want -
@DementedMuscle "...I..." She paused for a moment.. "C'est nouveau."
@INSANOWILLRULE - ..it made her blush.
@INSANOWILLRULE She couldn't help but wonder.. "Are..are you trying to..impress me..?" The notion pulled a softer giggle from her. In fact,-
"Je suis. Je suis..."
@INSANOWILLRULE A soft chuckle escaped her. "..Alright, I suppose that's true."
@INSANOWILLRULE "I have no idea what you are saying, dear.." She frowned some.
@INSANOWILLRULE "...Pffft. I was having a little fun..no need to speak Arabic at me~"
"Pardonnez-moi..uhm.." She stumbled. "Je ne parle un peu Francais.."
"..Oui!"
She couldn't help but blush a little. It was sorta fun..attempting to remember a language she had almost completely forgotten.
"..Ah..Je voudrais un vin rouge~"
Another, more spirited giggle.. "C'est un simple amusement, non..?"
A little giggle spilled from her.. "Je m'appelle le Gomme de Bulle.. Et toi, monsieur..?"
"..Bon soir, mon ami."
@flxmeprxnce ((...huh?))
@flxmeprxnce ((...uhm...))
@Bonnibel_Peebs - was searching for and inspecting.
@Bonnibel_Peebs - propped up by her right hand. Maybe she was inspecting her physical appearance. Maybe it was something deeper that she -
@Bonnibel_Peebs - despite John's words otherwise, she was...is, is, an attractive woman. Her head tilted to the right as she leaned back, -
She sat at the edge of a lab table and peered straight ahead, into the very same mirror that had given her confirmation, so long ago, that-
@flxmeprxnce - to the Candy Kingdom..?" Her gaze was soft, pallid, and understanding as she peered at him.
@flxmeprxnce - too often.." She wasn't too far along, it would seem, as her body wasn't much larger than her lithe size. "What.. brings you-
@flxmeprxnce Finally, she was able to breathe, it seemed. "No..I suppose I should have told you. It simply doesn't come up in conversations-
Her voice was soft, diluted, as she whispered, "Nope..you never play with hearts..."
@flxmeprxnce -precautious now that I'm ..expecting. You wouldn't be just melting me, you'd be melting the Candy Kingdom's heir.."
@flxmeprxnce She was exhausted from the sprinting.. It had depleted her already dwindling energy. "I'm sorry I.. I'm just a little extra -
@flxmeprxnce // gimme a sec..like..20 ish mins
@flxmeprxnce - from him. However..she fought it. "..O..Okay. Okay. But..don't come any closer, please.." It was a plea, less a request.
@flxmeprxnce She was wincing, subtly withdrawing from him. Her fight or flight was kicking in, and so desperately, she desired to flee -
@flxmeprxnce -Her voice called back to him; "...Whaddya want, ya donk? You here to skronk up Ooo?!"
@flxmeprxnce - he had was to let his flames lick at and consume the candy forests, kingdom, and eventually Ooo.. She couldn't allow it. -
@flxmeprxnce She paused, stopped, completely. It afforded her the chance to catch her breath, to calm her pulse. Surely, the only intent -
@Bonnibel_Peebs - forest. Surely, that Flame Prince wouldn't find her there..
Oh glob.. Bonnibel bad began panicking, shrieking even; "..No! GET AWAY FROM ME..YOU'LL MELT ME FOR SURE..!" She sprinted away, into the -
"..What the shit. I was supposed to give that one guy a tour..like..it's 4 days past when we scheduled, right..?"
"..So..I'm glad this is not me-centric, as I am on recovery from all of the me-centric drama~"
@PostalGuy200 "That's amazing!"
Uh..the pink queen has no idea what the hell is going on.
// fucking Photoshop. 
@INSANOWILLRULE "You're sweet when you learn stuff~"
@MarshallBassGod - @_black_bass_ .
@MarshallBassGod "It's cool, bro..I used red corn. Look..he got the girl, but..he already knew he had her. See..?" She blatantly pointed at-
@INSANOWILLRULE Alright, true..to continue the snugglefest, she nuzzled into him, gently.
Her pink hands slid the popcorn to @MarshallBassGod . "Look at him..that was cake. No wonder he likes her, in addition to Fi..No challenge."
@INSANOWILLRULE You have to consider his journey from beginning to end.
@INSANOWILLRULE Perhaps a split between Rebel and King.
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded quickly. The Rebel's core desires fall in sync with his own.
@INSANOWILLRULE - paper; 
@INSANOWILLRULE She is the "Lover", she explains, very driven by the core idea that love can change and heal all. She also hands him a -
@INSANOWILLRULE - identity to my ideal that I am the only one who can love anyone, ever, as much as they truly need it~" She flirted..?
@INSANOWILLRULE "..You're fine. It's just that my archetype involves the crisis of objectifying the people I love, as well as losing my own-
@INSANOWILLRULE Bonnibel slid her arms around him and pulled him into an embrace. "..Sorry."
@INSANOWILLRULE Tegan feels weird having to conjure up jealousy on a whim.
@INSANOWILLRULE "It's okay, John. I'm okay...Okay..?"
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded, silently.
@Bonnibel_Peebs - you weren't intending to bother me, but it did.."
"..I don't feel like doing this. Yes, you hurt my feelings. A bit. I'm gaining weight. I'm having a baby.. Your baby. I'm sensitive..I know-
"..Okay."
"Oh look, a field..let's go adventuresplore."
She offered a gentle shrug. "..Ok. You're correct."
@INSANOWILLRULE "..It's fine.."
"..Oh, it's nothing personal..I just find this other chick way more attractive~"
@INSANOWILLRULE "...Not -entirely -"
@INSANOWILLRULE "..Oh, I don't like Lantern John, I just find him attractive.." Pfft.
"@INSANOWILLRULE doesn't understand that it's just ...nature" Nod nod. 
@INSANOWILLRULE "...You can stop saying that."
"Hmmm..? Hating someone implies you still care." 
@Bonnibel_Peebs // it is now... "Vomitsonthe" lol.

//I am naming my PC the last status of the first person who faves this.

// MY SONS FIRST CRUSH IS RAVEN~~~~~~~ HE SAID HE WANTED TO KISS ALL THE RAVENS BECAUSE SHES BEAUTIFUL~~~
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded and pointed to Koriandr. "Yep..I've been told we sound similar~"
"..I only watch Teen Titans Go! because I'm on it~ "
// He doesn't care anymore. Lol. 
@INSANOWILLRULE Oh.. His warm touch against her always, always felt the best. "..I love you, dear."
@Bonnibel_Peebs - New to me..and the last Gray I encountered..wanted to know if I was really bubblegum flavored, and how one would find out"
"The reason I won't RP with you is because...typically...er..when I RP with males..they want it to go in a direction that I don't. You are-
@INSANOWILLRULE Her face pressed into his chest, tenderly. "..I don't want it to, you charmer."
@MarshallBassGod She points at the other MARSHALL Lee, @_black_bass_ , failing at getting lucky.
@MarshallBassGod NOT YOU, LOL
@INSANOWILLRULE - I'm glad we haven't lost our spark."
@INSANOWILLRULE "I.." A soft blush stained her, momentarily. "I'm glad that..well..it was in earnest. Just..raw emotional demonstration. -
@INSANOWILLRULE - as well!"
@INSANOWILLRULE She nodded once more and brought the round confection to her lips for more nibbles. "Well, I enjoyed having coffee with you-
