Nice wee favour from St mirren there
Can't believe I slept in and missed my interview this morning
How can you look at these results and not believe we will be independent in the next ten years
We've done it
Is Jim Murphy turning a losing speech into a better together speech
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA @JimForScotland
Oh my god
Hurry up lanark
@AlistairM92 wish they came second
HAHAHAHAHA CANABIS IS SAFER THAN ALCOHOL
Unreal
Please Motherwell
Mhairi Black is incredible
I can't keep up with this
@ClydesdAileen @euanspc haha, I'm really confident now
@euanspc @ClydesdAileen good stuff, and is it true about the labour people leaving?
@euanspc @ClydesdAileen how is it going?
@EvanJones_  
@EvanJones_ a lot of older people will get a shock
@EvanJones_ @rachaelbailliex she probably doesn't know there's an election on fs
@rachaelbailliex @EvanJones_ I'm not old enough either, doesn't mean you can't do anything
I hate seeing people say they are not interested in politics, it affects you in so many ways and you can't even be bothered to pay attention
@EvanJones_ 28 years he's been in and done nothing, same with the rest of Scotland, need huge changes
@EvanJones_ everyone was saying today they would love for that fat neglecting bastard to be kicked out
@EvanJones_ we're trying to be realistic not optimistic but as long as @CrawleyAngela wins here I will be happy
@EvanJones_ that's too much though mate, will be closer to 50 but that is still incredible
Been out since 9 this morning and that's me just back in. I hope this is worth it #SNP
Heard yer da's just voted labour
Just in case you didn't know
#SNP

Finally got another interview, any job would be better than this one <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

2.3m live in relative poverty

These children need our attention

Not a pri…
How much of a mutant bastard do you have to be to genuinely care about the royal family
Up in 4 hours to climb Ben Nevis, decent
@martindelaney97 everyone is pish
Accies away <SOCCER BALL>️
Positive thinking
I've pretty much accepted I'm not getting into uni
Going to apply for college as a back-up
Surely Inverness will get fined or something for those tweets

haha just joking, it's extra time folks #banter.
@ReeceMcGee  


Guess I should probably start watching game of thrones then
Wish I was going to Partick away
Work is surprising good today
@garydenholm what college?
@browni same, but tonight was the best we've played all season I thought
It's weird actually looking forward to Motherwell games again
Oh, please tell me Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Can already tell going out in a dual control car with my dad will be a disaster
I'd be more excited to leave school if I had a clue what I'll be doing next year
Still no idea what I'm doing
No idea why I took so long to make another twitter
