OFMSHIS
HOLY SHIT 
@Cuddles4Harry and it's so bad coz other people might be in these photos without knowing and it's an invasion of their privacy
@NaughtyBoyMusic future
@Cuddles4Harry and he nor his security guards give consent to have his photos taken at the gym or pool
@Cuddles4Harry it's even worse when it's in a hotel gym- it's technically private property and you need people's consent for photos
Just a heads up: never ever ever ever joke about cancer. Even if you're 'trolling'. It makes you look like an even bigger cuntface
@Cuddles4Harry it's so sad :( like he is fine with it every other time like chill out /$/?
@IrwinEmocional @1DAlerts at the hotel the boys were staying at in Melbourne :)
@IrwinEmocional @1DAlerts I've asked him for a photo after a work out and he politely declined and said for us to come back later for one :)
Last photo saved my life  
*sighs* and I thought the whole Essendon saga was over....

#BadBloodMusicVideo 
When does the late late show air? Need to do my time conversion

I don't get why people will take photos of Harry when he's in gym/swim wear when he's said a million times he doesn't like it <IMP><IMP>
thank you!!! @ people who take photos of him at hotel gyms, he specifies he doesn't like it ALL THE TIME!! 
Might as well call next years Grammys the 1989 awards like  
Me 2 hours ago: 'I might go to sleep a bit earlier today'

@whateverlinaa watching Carlton play snapchat edition: round 5 (vs Collingwood)
@fiftyshdesharry I DONT KNOW BUT ITS NOw HARRY
@fiftyshdesharry I can't DEAL WITH THIS
WHY IS THIS BACK I HAVENT RECOVERED FROM THE FIRST TIME  
Purely because my team is that shit that its easier to be disappointed in them instead of being mad at other teams
I've seen to gain a following die to my footy tweets you're all lucky I'm not as mean as I was last year
This you tubers tag is just fans dragging their asses I'm laughing so hard
Four stages of watching Carlton play: round 6 edition (vs Brisbane)

I hope karma kicks ** and **** in the arse and everything fucks up for them but only a little bit BUt a lot at the same time
okay I need to calm down
Don't get it coz NB is a incredibly sexist and racist person and why would zayn associate himself with a person like that
I'm honestly so fed up with how disgusting he is. You're a 30 year old man, act like one you fucking child
I've never seen somebody leech of someone else's fame as much as @NaughtyBoyMusic has with zayn. Poor zayn. :((((((((
Why the fuck should I respect what naughty boy said in that article when he said thing nice and was just shit talking what???
@gayniaz it's from 2012 I think... When he was in New Zealand or Australia for the tour :)
I honestly can't stop crying I'm like a fucking sink tap with the water coming out of my eyes at the moment

Look same same  
Really  
I don't even know what I was gonna say okay that's alright
Okay last tweets about this whole thing coz I just want to get everything off my chest
Next headline: Taylor Swift to guest star as tiana's lover in the next season of empire  
And remember when Rihanna constantly talks about Harry ohhhh habibi what a time to be alive
Everyone thinks that zayn will have the support the rnb crew when they just as salty about how he do ooooOoooo

I'm so tempted to unfollow everyone to be honest coz I hate all of this and I just get really negative vibes and bad thoughts over
with ANY OF THEM
People bringing up the 'he always met fans on 1d' thing, oh no you fucking don't no don't you dare when you know that's not true
Zayn and Louis were the worst of all sweethearts, trust me this whole break up has finally pulled their heads outta their asses
Oh only if you all weren't so narrow minded and knew how not just zayn but all the boys used to fuck off fans on tour <NEW MOON WITH FACE><NEW MOON WITH FACE><NEW MOON WITH FACE><NEW MOON WITH FACE>
The uni culture and how different it is between Australia and America
Do you know what I get confused about
I'll stop now okay I'm sorry I'm just annoyed at what I'm seeing on both sides of this equation
At zayn stans  
TAYLOR WHY YOU GOTTA DO ME LIKE THAT
I'm so sick and I need to get my injections done on Monday I hate my life why does this always happen

@yelyahwilliams 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
Fuck I honestly don't have time for this narrow mindedness
Zayn stans logic: stop tweeting about zayn and tweet about the other 4 God!!! *start tweeting about ot4* LOL YOU ACTUALLY STAN THEM?!
No iM so annoyed at people i honestly wish I could line you all up and shoot you in the fucking head
Had a dream I killed every single zayn stan in the world and it was fucking fantastic that I am considering doing it in real life
Juzzie when he sees naughty boys tweet about empire 'kill me now'
I HATE MY LIFE SOMEONE TELL@NAUGHTY BOY TO STOP LIKING EMPIRE
Okay no bye this was my favourite show I now have to drop it coz of your shit ass  
@whateverlinaa and they like but but look at him hahah
Zayn is the realest definition of fuckboy if there's ever been one. Everyone gets angry with him then we are reminded how attractive he is
This tweet is so funny in the context of everything ahahah 
Also I have the worlds biggest headache and mum thinks it's cool to start the washing before 8.30am
@whateverlinaa not much else?? Like for real??
'Tell me again zayn doesn't care?!' Yeah well he still doesn't..... You're fans of him of course he's gonna show affection towards you and

Bella and Abel <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@cupidwakeup most of them aren't from both sides, it's just people throwing insults
@JKCorden we are counting on you for real answers i.e 1d. Along with some lols. But mostly answers
@whateverlinaa mean they don't have an informed or educated opinion about things
I hate when people say that, people have the right to an opinion. Just because they listen to 1d or to Taylor Swift or heavy metal doesn't
Apparently no ones allowed to have an informed opinion coz we listen to certain bands music woooo!!! 
'Particularly the White fans' YOU WONDER WHY PEOPLE PICK ON YOUR RACE WHEN THEY FIGHT YOU
Wow you're so cool!!!!!!!!!! Wooooo!!!!! 
@osnapitzcameron @JaydenSeyfarth I don't know whether I should love him or hate him I'm so sorry omg

I can't believe everyone actually thinks zayn was stressed fucking hell
@Larry_Lashton1 @zaynmalik 'stressed' and 'being completely fucked up on drugs and alcohol' are two different things
@Larry_Lashton1 @zaynmalik mentally ill then turning your back on the people who support you is not worth people's time to be honest
@Larry_Lashton1 @zaynmalik they weren't nothing, I know that. But lying through your teeth and implying that you are stressed or
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO PRINCE HARRY AND YOU ASK ABOUT 5SOS. LIKE. ASK SOMETHING WORTH ASKING
@whateverlinaa also have a steady job and have internship offers coming out my ass so don't 'don't you have a life' me you dumb fucker
'God don't you have a life' yes I'm 20 years old, 3rd year in uni, go out every weekend, average a HD and about to go on a 7 week holiday??
@Larry_Lashton1 @zaynmalik hunny oh no :( please don't tell me you believe that, he's trying to cover his tracks
I love how all the replies on zayns tweet are like 'you've got to be kidding me'
@zaynmalik oh no you fucking don't turn this around on us when you lie through your teeth every chance you get

When ur exam is literally a week before you leave on holiday for 7 weeks
Look I woke go on a date with prince Harry
@whateverlinaa being wrong about his religion or his beliefs and shit.... Like you always think you're right shut the fuck up for a second
Legit though zayn stans are all like 'the boys bever defended zayn' I'll tell you why, if they did you would've told them off for

@stylesandjord I'm just over him, honestly. I'm over them both, good luck to them but karma is an absolute bitch and it will hurt them both
@whateverlinaa also tinashe, the killers, 5sos and a bunch of others the point is I don't need zayn
ot4, ed Sheeran, riri, Taylor swift, maroon 5 is all I need
@NaughtyBoyMusic I'd turn off your location or are you that eager for people to fight you 1v1? Coz I will and I'll win
@God can you take naughty boy music away from earth and bring my dad back coz he was actually an amazing person
@stylesandjord he's just a nasty person, and he thrives on hurting people's feelings
I'm also waiting for Ed's little tweet about this
@stylesandjord like he just went for the brothers from oasis it's like you know that one song made more money than you're whole life
I'm waiting for naughty boy to drag ed Sheeran and then Ed will kill his 'career' with a one word tweet
NEK MINIT 
@Cuddles4Harry it's such a good song! Every time it comes on I'm like wooooo hell yeah hahah
k1ngkyrg1os's photo 
Gotta long list of ex lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane @Louis_Tomlinson

I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD if James Corden doesn't make them tell the truth in the interview I'll kms

@whateverlinaa she started that organisation so young people could have an escape from narrow minded old cunt fucks like you wtf
apparently miley cyrus cant be inspirational because she likes to show skin and stand up for her opinion... get the fuck outta here

I'm still pissed off that maroon 5 isn't singing feelings like mf I did not spend 200 dollars on you not to sing it
Let's pretend it's my first time, so you can really blow my mind

#1989TourTokyo 
I should've rubbed their heads or something for good luck god damn
Those girls were from Adelaide as well and Harry took them backstage at the TMH tour and they met Justin like the weekend before
@whateverlinaa her 'sorry I need to meet my sister in 10 minutes otherwise I don't have a way home'
I remember the two girls next to me at the red tour getting into club red and then the lady was like 'you can come too' but i said to

Oi at Wembley can you come on stage in a giant egg or something @edsheeran
But ed omg
Like yeah 1d and Taylor put on this extravegent shows with pyro and dancers (for Tay) and moving around
Fuck I'm still in awe at the fact someone like Ed Sheeran is selling out stadiums like he does fuck all he's only got a loop pedal
Taylor still can't dance though omg home girl how many times have you toured hahah
Can 1d go back on tour I need more Harry grabbing his dick aka great masturbation material

Looks like plans for the weekend are out the window thanks to the two oral presentations I have the start of next week
My white out pen just exploded all over my hand I haven't had this much white stuff all over me since.... nvm
I dedicate how many times by tinashe and future to @Harry_Styles you're welcome baby
I'm so confused
KATY 
@stylesandjord people are calling Harry out for not going to met gala and it's like why would he anyway? They are saying stupid shit
Gaga looks cool I like her outfit a lot
Anyway if anyone is in need of lemons or olives our olive and lemon tree have literally exploded with them so holla
Also, for people who claim to love Harry a lot, you all have such a low opinion of him. Thanks for pointing that out Tylah
@whateverlinaa doesn't like doing things that don't involve music IE why he doesn't show up to met gala or fashion shows on his own
Fucking INCREDIBLE person. all these jobs like Calvin Klein and shit were originally sorted for Harry, but he said no because he
Crazy for that little while is Harry Styles. Harry is the epitome of what a heartthrob is, with the added bonus of him being an actual
The one person at the moment who is standing in Justin Bieber's way to get to the fame he was originally at before he went
Alright I'm gonna say this once and everyone better listen.
Harry doesn't need nor want his ego boosted every chance he gets unlike Justin, he's fine doing what he does
Why is everyone yelling coz Harry isn't at the met gala
badgalriri's photo 
Rihanna and Gigi by far the ones who have done it for me
Miley looks gorgeous as well
RIHANNA
Gigi fucking Hadid you blow my mind holy shit
@taylordeere AHH THATS SO EXCITING OMG
I dropped my phone on my face three times in a row okay time to get out my iPad

And 5sos have a new song? And something happened with Niall?
Apparently 5sos started a tour and I've been informed swifty is starting her tour today as well
So much shit is happening on my tl I don't know who's talking about what
look at HER BLOODY HELL DAKOTA 
GET THE FUCK OUT LOOK AT HER WHAT A HUNNY  
CAN OT3 SHOW UP LIKE RANDOMLY I WOULD DIE IMAGINE HARRY ROCKING UP WITH A 3/4 UNBUTTONED SHIRT
Tbh what is the gala without Taylor Swift??
Everyone is at the met gala I'm so sad
TARAJI YES SECOND MUM YOU WORK IT

DARLIN 
@Real_Liam_Payne thinking and saying the obnoxious shit they are. I can't wait to hear the new stuff <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
@Real_Liam_Payne you have nothing to answer for. People change and people move on, it's about time the fans did that and stopped
You find Liam saying 'new fifth member' insensitive but are okay with innocent people getting killed on a daily #legup #hellno
Joke about what? Zayn left the band, why does he need recognition? Let them ALL LIVE THE WAY THEY WANT. thanks <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS> 
Liam wins, go home everyone
you ARE THE FUCKING ACE  
Look at this wanker 
YALL THE FUCK IS THIS 
@chaneltiffany_ all mine are the same I'm offended
@spidermansteph his last Insta video was like 'new fifth member?' I found it funny, but as usual everyone is butthurt
@whateverlinaa ZAYN LEFT THE FUCKING BAND HE DESERVES NO MORE RECOGNITION OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THEM
Why is everyone saying 'what about Zayn?' to Liam? What ABOUT ZAYN?! HE FUCKING LEFT WHO GIVES A FUCK?19:$:&amp;:!
I am SO LOLWUSB
#StarWarsDay

Better than words gets me in a good mood
Why does Harry wear a shirt if he leaves all the buttons undone BESIDES ONE
Hunny 
Omg wtf 4 years since I saw the my world tour

Niall is looking so good recently I have to admit
@micaelaaaax Levi's outlet at DFO Moorabbin :)
Alrighty @ George from union J showing up in our lecture AHHAHA 
When people are like 'I love your curly hair'... No. No you most definitely do not
It's sad that the same people meet the boys and ones who try and try get no where coz of them
@fiftyshdesharry I like that song a lot
THIS IS SO CIUEB 
Far side of the moon by  @Tinashe is my sound, what a hunny
@Jacinders look if I find out anything I'll let you know

Does tori kelly song that nobody love song
@MorgsRoth <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Again 
@Jacinders like YO FOR REAL LIKE IM LITERALLY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WORLD
@Jacinders there and my cousin didn't know it was him until his friend pointed it out and he's like 'yeah he was really nice' and I'm
@Jacinders not joking, last year 2 of my cousins were in LA, and they were together and one of them ran into Harry at a restaurant
My cousin is living in LA and Harry, Liam and apparently Louis are there
Fuck me 
For someone who is incredibly ugly i sure do like taking selfies
@Jacinders for sure! I think elsa is stunning as well but as you said, it's not on par with the other Angels
@Jacinders thank you omg, there's probably like 2 girls that stand out, the rest are like meh
Oh boy 
This is Harry's child  
Those digestive biscuits with chocolate on the bottom are without a doubt the greatest tea biscuit on this earth
Everyone's talking about state champs and I thought it was some cheerleading thing until someone's like 'this is like 5sos with 1d again'
I cannot wait to go on a gondola ride in Venice but ill be the bitch trying to tip the boat
Punched myself in the nose in my sleep now it won't stop bleeding good morning
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>

Hmmmmm @ how this little mix and Harry thing comes out the same day as little mix announcing a new single <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><EYES><EYES>
@hey_be_youtiful <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I don't even know what's wrong with me tonight I'm incredibly nostalgic
I'd give anything just to hug my dad again and tell him that I love him and I miss him
God i never thought I wouldn't see him again
I can't believe that the last time I saw my dad alive was in hospital and I remember saying to him 'see ya later, I love you'
@raniaaxo thank you babe <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
@tylahashburn <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
But I'm thankful I got to spend the time I did with my dad
I'm sad
@whateverlinaa meet my future children and I hate the fact that good people get taken away
@whateverlinaa graduate uni and do what I love, he'll never get the chance to walk me down the aisle and never get the chance to
@whateverlinaa and it's dawned on me that he never saw me graduate high school or turn 18, and that he'll never see me
@whateverlinaa and he is one of the reasons I love journalism and writing so much coz he did and I wanted to be like my dad
@whateverlinaa even though we've heard the stories millions of times, it's just good to be reminded of him and how amazing he was
It's nights like these I really miss my dad coz we all just sat around talking about him and all the good memories
@emmastacey_ people are annoyed.
@emmastacey_ like I honestly didn't have a problem that they'd swipe left with Harry but yeah the video explains a lot more as to why
@whateverlinaa I have confirmation of this
sigh when fuckboy looks like Heath Ledger
I have fluffy bed socks on I feel like I'm getting a pedi
@emmastacey_ pissed off since he is 1000000000% more of a person than those girls could ever dream
@emmastacey_ it's not that it's the way they reacted as if they were disgusted he was even a human being so quite frankly I'm
Everyone's so high and mighty it's like wow okay
Empires getting so intense

#Logies #TVWEEKLogies 
I love Luke Arnold! He did such an incredible job portraying Michael <TWO HEARTS>
I didn't realise that many people started on home and away
I was reading this Harry fic and it was really nice and innocent then all of a sudden BAM he's a sadist and has the chick tied up
Although there's only 2 players on that you know we're coming poster that are actually still at Carlton so
THIS IS TOO FUNNY 
I AM SO PROUD OF US  
St Kilda deserved that match what the fuck
@temperharry it was the worst and best day of my life tbh
That was the day I grew a backbone and became the bitch I am today thanks 1d
I remember she called me a fucking slut coz I was wearing a colourful play suit and I'm like 'you know what'
And me and that mum going 1v1 around all the news vans
Nothing was more hectic than when 1d were at the Logies that was so fucked up
yes woo all the ethnic fans thinking they are better than everyone else ONCE AGAIN what a shock
when was he last time little mix sold out a tour- OH WAIT
@hey_be_youtiful there's more to this which I can't find but even their reactions are :/ 
@hey_be_youtiful in the scheme of things but it wasn't needed, it was unnecessary and rude
@hey_be_youtiful they were just rude like they were playing a game and they called Harry ew and it might not seem like much
Let's do it  
Imagine if Nadine shades Harry, Tylah would catch the next flight to wherever she is at and kick her ass
First Nadine now little mix I'm laughing
Fuck at least 5sos have some fucking talent to back themselves up
Fuck everyone is ACTUALLY DELUSIONAL I'm sorry you think little mix would be anywhere without 1d?
LOOK AT THE ALPACA  
I'm hysterical  
@tylahashburn love the fans xxxxx

I don't get how people find it enjoyable to watch two grown ass men inflict physical pain on one another
SCREAMIMG CRYING
LAST RT LOL

The amount of money going into this #MayweatherPacquiao fight is absolutely disgusting. Put the money to better use
Christ almighty
@fcknarryy exactly!!
@fcknarryy its so frustrating. Like I respect Zayn but he doesn't want anything to do with 1d anymore, why should he be acknowledged?
@bandmercth Logies are today ahaha
I love babies I want one
Legit though how old is queen Elizabeth? She's still kicking it, what a women
@whateverlinaa they played a part in the team to get there in the first place
@whateverlinaa season, and that footy club wins the premiership, that player doesn't get recognised for it, even though
As harsh as that is and as much as I love Zayn, that's how it works. it's like if someone leaves a footy club half way through the
Zayn left 1d, he doesn't need nor deserve to have the  awards they are nominated for so fuck off with the #BBMAsRecognizeZayn tag
the princess is so cute omg I want one
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>

Did watch the latest episode of GoT at 5am coz I woke up and couldn't go back to sleep
Me at work today: 'dun talk'
Anywayyyyy what a shit day it is today
Not only do you have a pole stuck up your ass, but a fucking fake personality too. Just remember, H didn't like you like he... nvm <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm so confused at people

“lady-boner”

“dadbod" 

“badassery" 

"come for the verb, and cum for the noun"
I just dropped my phone on my face again I think it's time to go back to sleep
@groovyhes tell me about it
@iwontmindstan the article is completely irrelevant though like I'm so confused where the website has put it 
Look the fuck you think I am making me watch all these Collingwood highlights I JUST WANT TO WATCH MICKS PRESSER YOU PIECES OF SHIT
@iwontmindstan apparently some article came out saying that he was approached by fox about season 2 coz Yazz wanted him on
Literally who the fucks calls someone this late bitch I want to sleep
this may come true soon tho <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SMILING FACE WITH HALO> 
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>

@whateverlinaa @Harry_Styles is this you watching the packers
@whateverlinaa @NiallOfficial is this you watching derby

Okay I just sent out the most accurate snapstory following me watching highlights of tonight's game get on it: linamitri
@adriimaria legit I have 2 cents to my name and I brought them HAHA but on the flip side they are good brushes. And legit omg
@Real_Liam_Payne you the realest hunny
@adriimaria fuck omg I brought these make up brushes from napoleon only coz the case was sick AHAHA and the big brush had a sick pattern
When fuckboy says 'sorry about my friends, but we should all hang out tomorrow night' <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Real_Liam_Payne I thought you said 2000 grand and I was about to face palm but carry on hunny
Again why do I go for Carlton? Who said it was a good idea?
Someone was like today 'can I see your camera roll?' And I'm like 'it's just Harry styles'
@Stace95 @zaynmalik IM SO SAF
OH MY FIW

@zaynmalik fucking delete this
The guy in channel 9 talking about the Albury gang rape is spot on, what a top bloke. Give him a raise. Hopefully more men think like that!
@hey_be_youtiful you should get feedback, it's kinda stupid if your tutor didn't give it back
@hey_be_youtiful writing. I'm still in that process to be honest ahaha! I handed in my first news report in about 18 months last week
@hey_be_youtiful that's good as for a first try! I got roughly the same as well, it just takes time to get to where you feel comfortable
*sees Zayn and Perrie in London while I'm there* *yells 'ZIAM FOREVER'* *jumps into a can and drives off*
Adriana and I go to Europe so soon omg
@adriimaria don't omg
It's gonna be such a good night for the footy tonight I'm so sad I'm not going
@hey_be_youtiful YES
WHAT IS  
@JackieWarner13 telling women that they shouldn't wear make up to feel 'beautiful' or whatever, it's like it's not up to you?? Ahah
Fuck I became more confident when I started wearing make up why should I stop wearing it if it makes me feel good?
Why is naughty boy allowed Twitter

JORNS

#2013FANDOMTHROWBACK 
Okay my whole heel is literally a massive green puss blister is is disgusting and I have to work tonight this isn't good



getting through 
     tonight?"



  w i c k e d"

@NaughtyBoyMusic and I'm pretty sure this is a tumblr post
See why the fuck do people do this shit like 
@tylahashburn  
@Gxbriellemxry yes for sure! I've found out some really surprising things about security and the security Union so I need as much as I can
@whateverlinaa out and about, please let me know your story so I can further investigate
@whateverlinaa ALOT during 1d so if you were mistreated IN ANY WAY by security when 1d was around, especially at the hotels and
@whateverlinaa around Celebs and how security act shifty (including the sexual favours for a chance to meet a celeb) and this happened
Okay guys I have a massive favour to ask! I'm thinking of doing a investigative story about how security treats people at events and
@Stace95 mine took 3 weeks, but I did it during off peak
I’m voting for @taylorswift13 for the #BBMAs Chart Achievement Award! You can vote here: 
Did you know there was exactly 17 months between the up all night, take me home and on the road again tours in Australia
IMA BLOW YOUR MIND
Gimme that
@whateverlinaa with the land and are such great people :( I wish I could do more than just donate
It just keeps getting worse in Nepal as well, that's so sad :( I'm so upset that these people are grieving when they live at one
Also 'drug addicts would still get their fix somehow!!' excuse, look fuck off because that meant less drugs on the streets
@bree1991x yeah that's why I'm like???? Does that make you any better than them? it doesn't. People are just frustrating
Bogans should get their internet rights stripped for being hypercritical ie having no problem with innocent foreigners being killed
I'm so confused like yes threaten to kill innocent people you fucking morons makes you so much better than the perpetrator!!
Your opinion was valid until a) you AGAIN started calling Bali a country and 2) threatened to kill the Balinese when it wasn't their fault
@Gxbriellemxry !!!!!!
I'm just ??? Coz America was gonna kill David Hicks and no one was like OMG BOYCOTT THE UNITED STATES
God and all the refugees effected by this now that are going to die in limbo coz of the broken down relationship between indo and aus
I absolutely hate capital punishment okay so I'm not agreeing with what Indonesia did since I find life for a life absolutely disgusting
Everyone's fine with Arabs and Africans being killed for crimes they didn't commit but oh no poor Bali nine people poor them <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Goodnight lovelies <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Bed time
@whateverlinaa and dealers off the street as much as possible to STEM THE FLOW then so be it
Like I find the death penalty :/ but illicit drugs kill millions each year and effect much more and if that means getting drug traffickers
DO YALL ACTULY THINK THEY WOULD'VE STOPPED SELLING DRUGS IF THEY WERENT CAUGHT FUCK THEY WERE DOING IT FOR AGES AND WERENT GONNA STOP
It's now buried under feet and feet of snow and that's sad because it's going to be practically impossible to get to those people now
All I can think about right now is that airport half way up mt Everest in Nepal and the fact it's the only escape for a lot of locals and
Kinda TMI but i was moving my foot in bed and popped this massive puss filled blister and I can feel it oozing
@whateverlinaa the most in touch with things like racial and sexual discrimination, the new rise in feminism and the race blockade etc
@whateverlinaa sad that the adults are putting us down because they believe we are uneducated and uninformed when in reality we are honestly
To be honest I'm glad it's stirring up a debate like CLEARLY young people care about situations going on around the world and its
Having said that, the western forms of 'democracy' are all full off shit as well so
@whateverlinaa the whole of South East Asia, all through the Middle East and into Eastern Europe is all corrupt as all hell
@chloethe1975 legit though how fucking hot does he look
@aIIIthelovehes <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
people don't know how deep the corruption and reverse dynamics of governments and law enforcers are in countries like Indonesia
ONE MORE TWEET CALLIN. BALI A COUNTRY I AM HITTING YOU ALL ACROSS THE FACE WITH AN ATLAS GOD DAMN
Prince George is so cute omg
Even through the nervousness and stress of everything in my life right now, there is this hope and… 
@tylahashburn heyyyyyyyyy
The fact that i might be able to see his smile and hug him soon makes me so happy
I'm really emotional over Harry
If you're gonna boycott every country that has purposely detained or killed an Australian you will be stuck on this fucking island for life
*moans in every language* 
@Ella1Dxo I'm not joking, I'm had to screenshot a map to prove it to them its actually so fucked how obtuse some people are
@Ella1Dxo yeah a lot more than I realised which is so mind blowing Hahah! I'm reading through all the sunrise comments about it and laughing
@whateverlinaa but a part of the Indonesia as an archipelago and that Balinese people are predominantly Hindu not Islam
If morons are gonna comment on this whole Bali 9 shit can ya at least learn basic geography and know that Bali is not its own country
IT IS JUST SO PERFECT 
All my contacts I've contacted are still synced to my iPod there is a god
ATTENTION IF YOU HAVE MY NUMBER PLEASE TWXT ME AND SAY ITS YOU I LOST ALL MY CONTACTS THANK YOU
Hopefully Sam Smith comes back and plays bigger venues plz
Can everyone send me as many Harry photos as possible I only have two
I'm so sad
Woah sam smith

New phone and the first photo I save is 
Goals: tylah and I walking through LA and meeting hazoff while they snuggle
“@MedievaIProbs: When your grandma slips you some money on the sly 
Sighs 
There's literally a drug and booze bus at the intersection of Wellington and Stud road right now and the traffic is backed up coz of it <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Alright I've got to go change my phone AGAIN hopefully this one works properly sheeeshhh

Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>
I can't keep up with this conversation we've gone from nationality to how sore Harrys anus would be after fucking people in line 3 minutes
I burnt the tip of my tongue on Peppermint tea and it still hurts @Harry_Styles do something.
@Stace95 I am glad I can keep you entertained hehehe
CAN USI 
@tylahashburn WHAT IS LIFE
@tylahashburn BUT SERIOUSLY
@Stace95 EVERYONE IS DOING THIS IM SO <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><CONFOUNDED FACE>
@tylahashburn I'm never pissing you off you have so much stuff on me I'm actually scared
@tylahashburn SISNSISBSIS
@tylahashburn I cannot BELUEVE I JUST TWEETED THIS
@tylahashburn WHATS PORN WITHOUT HARRY STYLES BEGGING YOU TO COME
Sis u no I do  
all the FAN FIC AUTHORS I LIKE ARE ALL TAKING A HIATUS AT THE SAME TIME WHY ARE YOU ALL DOING THIS MY MASTURBATION MATERIAL DEPENDS ON YOU
@GiGiHadid sis I'm gonna say welcome to be 20's life a little early but it'll be the best years of ur life love another 20yo hahah
Have some talent which I don't see through your big ass ego
I wonder where that big ego goes you fucking piece of shit. Stop making people feel like crap coz you have followers and apparently
@theheraldsun @Avengers @spidermansteph @cassiieee__ one of your photos is in here (I still don't know the difference b/w yall) (v sorry)
@shazamtop20 @Tinashe @Angus_OL my diary at 11 years old was 'I love nick jonas' ahahahaha
@tashcafun :) 
Okay olly is in Melbourne the weekend i get back from Europe ahahah
<CHERRY BLOSSOM><CHERRY BLOSSOM><CHERRY BLOSSOM> 
But I'm not gonna talk coz ppl can wear whatever the fuck they want doesn't matter if it's -12345 degrees outside
Ironic when someone complains about how they post photos with hardly no clothes when they do that themselves
Now you're mess is mINEEE
Can whoever meets Harry next give him an almighty hug
Lying is a bad trait @NiallOfficial
@emmastacey_ @Harry_Styles I had a bad dream involving him now I'm scared :(
Please be careful baby @Harry_Styles
I'm actually so upset oh my shut
1daf across all social media platforms 
my neighbour is playing 1d out loud so go see my reaction on snapchat: linamitri
@Stace95 :(
If something bad happens to Harry I'm honestly ending myself coz that dream was so fucked up I'm so sad
@tylahashburn Tylah I'm so scared I have such a shit feeling
@Stace95 I honestly woke up crying and I don't like it I have such a weird feeling
Then my mum is like 'yeah I remember, I also remember that he died 8 months ago' and I literally woke up crying
Then my mum was like 'Lina who are you talking to?' And I'm like 'mum don't be silly, I'm talking to Harry Styles! You remember him?!'
Driver. She died and I was all upset. Then Harry showed up at my door the next day and I was in hysterics and he just sat there holding me
Basically I was best friends with Harry. I was in the car with my uni friend on the way home from a night out and we got hit by a drunk
I just had a nap and i had the most fucked up dream
You're alive son  
I remember when Harry tweeted 'Lima you're incredible' and everyone made the edits saying 'Lina you're incredible' I was so blessed that day
See I could have quote rtd and changed Lima to Lina but NO 

#2013FANDOMTHROWBACK 
@cassiieee__ HAPPY BIRTHDAY:D
@whateverlinaa much for you live in a country like Australia :) 2 dollars is nothing so PLEASE just buy a pin/poppy from today until Sat!
@whateverlinaa day and they are such wonderful people. Please don't be like those people who just snob them off when they did so
If you see a veteran selling ANZAC day pins and poppies today, please spare 2 dollars and have a nice chat with them :) it would make their
Good morning everyone :)
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>
@basicallyjacqui I'm so sad ;(
Wtf I can't scroll anymore Bahah
Ha. Hahahahahaahhaahahhaahahahhahaha. Ha. 
YO FAM WHEN ARE WE GETTING A REAL AN UPDATED VERSION OF THIS FOR MY WANK BANK @nickjonas @Harry_Styles 
Oi but remember @Michael5SOS @camilacabello97 @Harry_Styles the screenshots I have will put y'all to shame 
LMAOOOOOO I WAS SUCH A NIALL GIRL 
What even is this @adamlevine 
AHAHHAHAHA FUCK 
2012 me was so embarrassing fuck 
THIS IS A GREAT REACTION PHOTO HAISSBSK 


I'm gonna tweet photos that I saved on my very first iPod touch I'm actually laughing
@whateverlinaa this doesn't even look like me when the fuck was this taken
I actually like this photo look how long my hair was me cries 
So olly MURS and Ed Sheeran both announced tours while I was at work did I miss anything else? Zayn coming back to 1d perhaps??
3 weeks for that piss weak 'punch' yall kidding @AFL
Ed sheeran and stereo fall on the same day I am so sad
@adriimaria YES AHHAHAHAH
@adriimaria imagine if we do I'll be so happy, like finally
@adriimaria <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Lina you need to go to work coz the euro and pound to Australian dollar is hella fucking low and you need that cash money for your holiday
I need to get out of bed and get ready for work but effort
The people in the Rio snapchat feature are so good looking what the fuck I'm so jealous
I really hope people take time to watch yesterday's episode of qanda because it was so eye opening
@tylahashburn yeah I think that's it hahaha
@tylahashburn there's a name for it like women who believe that women should be the only experia
Activism is about fairness and equality, not suppressing someone else's beliefs and knowledge and fact
I'm so confused as to why people think this it's like those feminists who think all males should die
that's like saying Jews weren't racially vilified during ww2 coz the majority of the European Jews were white like the fuck
'You can't be racist to white people' is like saying 'men can't cry because it shows weakness' a dumb ass fucking point
Hope everyone is Sydney is safe
Beautiful frog son I love you 
@Stace95 Omghsisbs I LOVE HER
yallah goodnight
Zayn's next tweet better be: 'guess what I'm single hahah no more Perrie the platypus <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C> x'
Is it safe to sleep??
Alright slow down Z I'm still recovering from the first notif
That's why people don't like you 
I hate time
That was like a complement that ended in a punch in the face and an insult wow
Fuck that tweet hurt fuck
Jesus fucking hell
@GeorginaTseros just omg at your tweet in the middle of everything AHAHAHAH 
@tylahashburn @Harry_Styles y u lyk dat
@Harry_Styles save me baby she's gonna kill me  
TYLAH IS ACTUALLY PLOTTING TO KILL ME FOR THAT HADINE TWEET AHAHAHAHAHAHDNAKS
HAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHHAHA
Nah legit what happened to emblem three hey were my life
I remember that day I was so shattered omg
Is zayn gonna pull what Drew Chadwick did when he was in emblem three and unfollow everyone
@whateverlinaa @zaynmalik WERE YOU LIKE BITCH YOU THOUGHT
Who needs coffee to keep you awake when you have Twitter drama
THIS IS WHY I DONT SLEEP COZ WHEN I DO THIS SHIT HAPPENS FUCK IM A 20 YEAR OLD UNI STUDENT LET ME LIVE
Next time zayn actually tweets it'll be a photo of him and Perrie and wedding rings you just watch FAM that's the day we all get churched
What is the middle boy Beckham called? How old is he?
I'm still so confused about everything zayn is like watching the end of inception for the first time CONFUSING AND BULLFUCKERY
And to the left we have 'solo zayn' stans thinking they are the greatest thing on earth when they are actually scum goodnight see ya
That's like saying you can't be friends with anyone you talk shit about like are you serious now??? Things change???
It's almost like people are forbidden to like zayn coz they said shit when they were upset with him??? What kind of fucking logic?????
@zaynmalik do the Kylie Jenner lip challenge I will pay the cash money to see it
Everyone's arguing now that was quick as shit
Thank god that Perrie tweet is off the top of his Twitter I was getting anxious with that shit there
My TL is just ZAYN WTF OMG GOD HAS RISEN
Literally my phone buzzed and I'm like the fuck and it was a notif
DID ZAYN JSYF
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>
Having said that, I have a long day of gym, assignments and work tomorrow so it's gonna be a early one for me
It's one of those nights you feel content with everything but everything would be that much better if you had someone to cuddle in bed
I honestly reckon he would've come down but too many people
Remember when we were chilling in the pool with josh and every single person Harry hung out with on tour was there EXCEPT HIM
Qanda is ripping it up tonight
@tylahashburn LEGIT like the only reason why I know Harry is des's child is bc of the fucking webbed feet
Harry and Gemma look nothing like des and so much like Anne and I often wonder if he is actually their father <NEW MOON WITH FACE><EYES>
Okay @ got
tarajiphenson's photo 
I hate watching my best song ever vid coz it's where Liam and I were conversing about my phone
I FOUNT A VIDEO OF HARRY LOOKING RIGHT AT CROWN CREW FOR A WHOLE SPEECB DURING ENCORE IM FLIPPING SHT
LOOK AT THUS 
Do you think Harry gets turned on when people pinch his nipples
Bro
It's back again  
@adriimaria omg I woke up in a sweat and I started freaking out ahahah
There's an emo version of Niall on the train and he has green hair I'm so shocked
Old school is the best 
@ugh_larryfeels just under 5'10 :) I know I'm meant to have large feet and hands but so disproportionate to the rest of my body haha
@ugh_larryfeels I'm 20 omg <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> I don't even know where it comes from honestly I don't like it
@TheTodayShow how is feminist offensive??! It's a term used to describe equality for all genders this is so stupid
I have such large hands and feet it's quite concerning
There's a fucking 4:20 party happening at uni today hahahashaosjsi
Lecture hall or horror movie 
I'm almost at 100,000 tweets oh my fucking god ahaahhaa
Happy game of thrones day
Look I like this 
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset
Have you guys chosen the winners of that game of thrones comp you had? :) @Telstra
Yooooo this is what happens when you let dumb people breed  
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>
Good luck today baby @Louis_Tomlinson <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️

@Louis_Tomlinson @CarltonFC this is you when you let teams get 10 goals in front
I can't wait to hear Nina at Wembley Stadium fucking hell yes
My hands are literally throbbing that's how fast and how much I've been writing I'm so over this
@tylahashburn she's so hot I'll honestly be so disappointed in frog son if he doesn't go there when he meets her
Hook up with tinashe @Harry_Styles
Fuck I'll be so happy if GCS win
If the Suns were kicking straight they'd be in front by 4-5 goals cmon #AFLCatsSuns
Cause of death: trampled on in Apple Store
I honestly almost got a black eye coz some dick muncher started swinging his hands around when I was attempting to talk to the apple guy
i don't know how the people at the apple store in chadstone survive tbh like jfc the amount of people in their e
BITCH BETTER HAVE MY MONEY
@Chet_Faker I'm gonna unlike the page for the lols
And when I mean people I mean people who don't show a general interest in m5 and are just going to find them for the sake of it
Look I will cut a bitch so fast if people meet Adam Levine and I don't coz I'm literally going in all guns blazing this m5 tour
#hazofflives 
I literally just got home from a day of shopping and I am honestly so tired I am a wrecked fish
If Geelong lose this won't they be 0-3 as well
Curse my size 11 feet and the inability to find a nice pair of boots
Chadstone to Knox omg
That was me just then and I have never felt more out of place in my entire life
You know that part of chadstone with YSL and Burberry and Gucci right next to David jones and you walk through it and feel extremely poor
@whateverlinaa at the price tag and I became sad coz it was 340 dollars :(((;
I saw the nicest Saba dress and I was like oooo clearance rack and I tried it on and it looks really good then I actually looked
Christ almighty chadstone is a fucking joke today
@whateverlinaa only two of us? Then fake laughs and goes 'I'm joking they are walking up now they'll all meet you'
@whateverlinaa freaking out then calmed down then he's like 'they don't want to meet anyone' and I'm like the fuck there's literally
@whateverlinaa place and we were freaking out coz it was getting closer to their departure time and then we saw dale and started
I had a dream last night that Adriana and I were the only ones waiting for 1d at the airport and we thought we were in the wrong
This is me though 
Im pissed off with Chris Yarran but I would punch Paul Chapman too
Honestly it was blue skies when I walked to to shops I walked out and about 2 minutes later BAM torrential rain
I literally got soaked right through running in the rain with 4 bags of groceries ahahah

hope it all wrks out htt…
Goodnight lovelies <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<TWO HEARTS>

Always knew you'd be a smart investor. Well done and all the best with the record label baby duck son @Louis_Tomlinson
@fandombeliefs tell that to the countless of girls he has fucked and tossed away on the tmh, wwa and OTRA tour sis
Any other feeling or emotion, but I'm proud of both for conducting themselves the way they have recently.
I'm at that point with this whole zayn and 1d thing where I can now appreciate and love both. I have no more anger, more confusion than
All I want is the boys to put a full four quarter effort, I don't care if we lose as long as we play well and show some heart
I'm gonna be at work the whole Carlton game today
That speech he did speaks more to me than that fucking statement ever could, honestly.
Zayn suits the shaved head so well
Goodnight lovelies <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
What I figured today: I love spicy food but my digestive system doesn't.

@Louis_Tomlinson @Harry_Styles I'm expecting Harry to start going for the brunettes now THAtS HOW ITS GOTTA WORK FAM

That's so disgusting but it's true ahaha
Louis is so happy that he can finally fuck vaginas that aren't crusty like Eleanor's was
UMMMM that blonde with Louis is <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@tylahashburn omg
@tylahashburn HAHAAHIAVSIABSHD
@tylahashburn he's sitting at the back of the lecture hall with his legs spread out I'm so concerned for my health right now
@_itshayleey omfg ahahaha
Tylah is playing sims while I'm going through a cute boy crisis
omg fuck demi is next week
kit harrington came up in the projector and i literally yelped
All because some dumb cunt didn't let the person entering the freeway merge in front of them and bam 6 car accident
The amount of traffic inbound on the Monash is ridiculous
Goodnight lovelies <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I'm tired

@emmastacey_ <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>🏼
Tony is better hawhgsbahsbsj 
Note that was H's hair at C23 and now I'm crying
Bish must love stevie nicks
Oh my god  
I love how awkward bryshere Gray looks in the I really like you video Justin did ahahahah
#IWannaMeetDemi nightingale because that song so beautiful and has an incredible meaning
Preaching love my fucking ass hole you stupid fucker
Someone pray I go 1v1 against nb I'll kick his ass back to the edge of the galaxy
I'm sorry where is the fucking logic of retweeting people who are hating on others? Like are you dumb? Attention seeker? Fuck head?
You are literally disgusting and I have no words to describe my dislike for you and your narrow minded fucking brain @NaughtyBoyMusic
@tylahashburn  
What the shit is this  
@iMellaa he was the one that leaked a photo of Harry and that Paige girl about a year or so ago, fucking self absorbed prick
I can't believe Harry was friends with a cunt lien this 
The Dubai snapchat is my life
LOUIs FACE AHAHAHAH 
When Adriana and I miss Glastonbury by 10 days <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
That fucking splendour line up holy fuck
Good morning, thunder is so loud it's shaking the ground and the rain is dirty
Goodnight lovelies <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
like damn bitch a prawn is a prawn
IS WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT and the dumb bitch had the NERVE to tell back when she knew I was right
I was just like you are yelling at me coz we ran out of the prawns you want, I offered you an alternative or a rain check WHICH
Some customer at work had the audacity to tell me 'the customer is always right' while I was having an argument with her and
YES 
It's that time of night where we thank god for Harry
I do not want to put my alarm on
@Calum5SOS remember the ones with the chocolate on the back?? they were the fucking best
I honestly  
I'm about to start work and Tylah sends me a Harry photo which take me at least 5 hours to get over
We literally have no backline with white and Menzel out far out
LMAO 
@_itshayleey it's okay I fixed it ahaha I forgot to turn on my screen back to laptop view instead of TV view
Utorrent has fucked up my laptop I'm so sad
I LOVE HOW THE GUY IN THE LONDON SNAPCHAT WAS LIKE 'if you're not raving you're misbehaving' THAT IS ME
It's disgusting, you're going against everything you apparently 'stand' for
That's mean but it's the truth, brining people down isn't going to do anything nor is it going to revive zayn's non existent career
Not just you. Stop bringing fans of the other boys down to make zayn look better,
And they think they are so high and mighty with their poc and feminism shit well guess what, a lot of people actually care about that
The majority of Zayn girls are some of the worlds dumbest most in denial fucking twat lickers honestly

expectation: "i love you so much, you're such an inspiration to me"

reality: 
AMAZING 
OB MY GOD HAHAHAHA @Real_Liam_Payne @Louis_Tomlinson
