@JeCanDance or their training needs to be amended at the very least
@JeCanDance of course not, but it's clearly not right to give them a weapon which can be used in such a way
@_Robertoo__ if activists did the same I'm sure someone would say that
@TheKirbyxox I know mate, please don't send me these any more, the pics are horrific and make me angry
@JeCanDance 
@TheKirbyxox I only get four pics mate, I can't possibly represent the whole thing.. But here's a better one 
@TheKirbyxox they use varying levels, it's still riot gear
@FaultyCivilian I agree, and I feel sorry for some of the officers because I'm sure they don't want to be there
@JeCanDance not where I live, regardless, if they can kill people with them.. And have done, why are they still issued?
@JeCanDance no, you're right, cos tear gas is invisible
However there are reports of its use in these riots, I was trying to convey sarcasm
@xTerahh  what about when protesters protect cops? Like in Baltimore; there are good and bad on either side, so why should one get weapons?
@FaultyCivilian I'm not trying to incite hatred towards cops, I just want to make people question their ability to "protect and serve"
@xTerahh @vhexspillow when has a police officer battering a protester ever helped a member of the public stay safe?
@JeCanDance have you ever seen either? There's tear gas clearly in one pic and batons and face guards in others
@xTerahh @vhexspillow they need to be prepared for self-defence, they don't need those batons.. Which have killed people
@ataliadelrio I'm not badmouthing, just offering food for thought - I would encourage you to experience the police at demos firsthand though
@FaultyCivilian @nesswilliamsx actually it's a protest - a riot suggests there's no reason or cause 
@ataliadelrio of course
however in many situations they are over equipped and it serves as an oppressive image that only encourages violence
That second pic shows cops using an incredibly painful pressure point on an activist who is clearly on the ground and outnumbered by the way
Activists turn up in cardigans &amp; jeans, cops turn up in riot gear &amp; carrying tear gas

Who really wants the fight? 
Houmous is a human right
They'll tell you it's to "record any crimes" but it's bullshit, you're all going into a database, I promise you (I'm already in it, woo!)
I guarantee that WW2 statue was vandalised by either an undercover cop or an undercover reporter

@al0nsy I only wanted to point out that respecting them does not always mean they'll respect you
@al0nsy 
@al0nsy I wish this was the case but I've had a cop push me to the ground for trying to sell copies of a Socialist paper
If you're planning on going to a protest 


The exception to this is if you are being searched, they may use force to keep you in place





If you're gonna go to protests please do yourselves (and the cause) a favour and research your rights.. Here are some important ones
What's wrong with that? I assume you're in a British owned cinema? Watching a British film? Drinking British coke?

How did the phrase "the shit" start being used as a positive way to describe something? That must've been a really bizarre scenario
Mum, I've made it.. People are copying my tweets 
@TurbulentStoker unfortunately it seems every country has that mentality
@TurbulentStoker I've had too many of these debates as of late, I'm a CND supporter and activist.. You're not, let's leave it at that
How can they legalise a sport in which all you do is kill innocent animals? It's 2015 we're supposed to be more civilised than this
@TurbulentStoker it's still an unnecessary and very dangerous investment
I hope @rustyrockets realises he has a lot of people to cheer up with today's trews
@marsjpg @paracetamxl that'd be an ironic way to bring about "democracy"
@TurbulentStoker I KNEW somebody would call me out on this! I was speaking figuratively, you know that, haha
It's a shame The Smiths aren't still together, the next five years would give them enough material for hundreds of songs

Might as well go all out and bring back the plague
@harrhun @SamuelFitt the figures aren't here yet but I don't want to think of how many homeless / disabled / unemployed people will die here
@harrhun @SamuelFitt mate, there are 900,000 people using foodbanks.. I'd take a welfare system like Greece's over this any day
@harrhun @SamuelFitt this "capitalist world" consists of the USA and us, things can change. Capitalism has failed everyone but the bankers
@harrhun @SamuelFitt ah the same old rhetoric of "money we didn't have" except your man Osborne borrowed more in five years
@harrhun @SamuelFitt this is not "top down" where have you been living for half a decade?
Nothing irritates me more than seeing privileged white tory teenagers
@harrhun @SamuelFitt are you for real? 
The only good thing about this is that nature will be forced to fight back and wipe out the horrendous parasites that we are
I literally started crying thinking about the foxes and badgers... How am I going to get through the next five years?
This is precisely the reason they don't want to lower it
because it might actually represent the interests of the UK 
Let's not forget that we're now going to spend Â£80-120billion on putting nuclear submarines back in the water
But hey! It doesn't matter because you still have your fucking soaps and talent competitions, so kick back in your Palace of Indifference
@tinyfox_ I'm serious ffi! You have to JUST DO some things and tweet others
@tinyfox_ ffi, be careful saying stuff like this
The painful truth
Please use what's left of your right to protest to fight this, because I guarantee you they'll find a way to take that away from us
I'm honestly fucking heartbroken
More zero hour contracts
More food banks
More power to corporations
More banker bonuses
More benefit cuts
More tuition fee rises
Less foxes
This whole farce of an election just goes to show how much of an influence the Daily right-wing rags have on people
@kittynoise you GO!
@ me next time  
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili I don't see any need to be condescending, I'm not criticising you or having a go
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili a coalition would still need approval, I can't see it happening (in the hypothetical situation of a PR system)
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili we can only hope for the best, whatever that is
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili but labour would still have somewhere near 30% 
They wouldn't pass a ConKip coalition with such a high Lab %
@tinyfox_ I think it did ffi, I think it did
@itsjust_lili @BenMcKinlayMP in a PR system  10% would be nothing compared to the devastating effects of a landslide tory win
I wish I could blissfully go through life watching the soaps and eating takeaways and doing my ironing but NO I had to give a shit didn't I?
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili that would be nowhere near as bad as a Tory win
MILLIONS DIAGNOSED DEPRESSED AT TORY WIN

I have, and it's ridiculous because six years ago I didn't even know what they were

WE NEED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION
I feel like the female protagonist in the lyrics to Common People is a good representation of every tory voter
Remember to get a good night's sleep tonight guys, cos fracking right under your home is going to keep you awake for the next five years
The real winner here is Rupert Murdoch
I think I'm the only one on Twitter who's watching the ITV coverage
Why is everyone on TV so excited and laughing and such? Oh yeah, they're all rich and don't represent any of the actual residents of the UK
I started the day so optimistic and happy, now I feel like George Orwell after he finished 1984
Ah sustainable rock and roll 
Don't worry kids, we'll be fine it's just sustainable rock and roll
That's an insult to true democracy
I wish people wouldn't call this system we live in a "democracy"

How to get young people involved in politics:
Listen to their opinions and try and meet their needs

It's not hard is it?
If the Conservatives win I'm just gonna skip college tomorrow because I'll never be able to afford uni or healthcare or fuckin anything
If the tories get in (and it looks like they probably will) the whole UK better be on the streets in opposition
@ Scotland please separate from the UK and then let me move in
This sounds like a threat, oh dear, no I mean that austerity and poverty and privatisation of the NHS are going to cost lives
People are going to die because of this
@RBB1959 I'm not up for any more debating, it became a mess of personal attacks
@Maxaretunit or nothing, just a suggestion based on the fact that everyone else has
@Maxaretunit leave it pal
@northernvice and what are you hoping to achieve?
@northernvice I didn't bring the place where I reside into it
@neilosborne5_  who said I don't wash? I'd argue living in a caravan is more character building than a run of the mill house
@V4VixVendetta @LordyDJ85 @B00B_DYLAN @ccccclarkee @Maxaretunit that's the thing, she does, even when you throw it back in her face
@neilosborne5_ @B00B_DYLAN @ccccclarkee life experience is not defined by years
@neilosborne5_ @B00B_DYLAN @ccccclarkee I really pity you, you're clearly a very sad person.. I don't think you can even see it
@neilosborne5_ @ccccclarkee @Maxaretunit @RealBlackIrish @mickyluv7 don't be so fucking rude
@Little_G2 at no point have I said anything about spending money that isn't there
@realmonkey2 @mickyluv7 @Little_G2 please do!
@Little_G2 I don't want to discuss my job openly on Twitter, you're welcome to DM me if you're genuinely interested
@Maxaretunit @ccccclarkee @V4VixVendetta @RealBlackIrish @mickyluv7 Steve, leave.
@milkypirate thanks man!
@realmonkey2 @mickyluv7 @Little_G2 you know where the block button is pal
@Little_G2 I work with young offenders, ex and current drug and alcohol addicts and the occasional rapist
@Little_G2 there's no reason it can't become more of a utopia
@Little_G2 it was a question
@Little_G2 and you're happy to keep it that way? Thanks for summarising my whole argument
@neilosborne5_ only doing as you do pal
@Little_G2  this is hardly comparable to nuclear war, he's consistently making attacks on me as a person despite my leaving the debate
@Little_G2 @mickyluv7 @ccccclarkee @B00B_DYLAN I prefer fighting fire with fire.. Especially when he's adding no real points
@mickyluv7 @ccccclarkee @Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN mate.. You're like twice our age, shouldn't you be in bed by now?
@neilosborne5_ that's very vague, but you do look ever so eloquent based on your profile
@Inst_4_Studies @mickyluv7 had one back in '09 

Totally overrated, GM crap
@neilosborne5_ please point out where I said anything that suggested I'm not intelligent
I'm exhausted, I'm no longer debating with anyone.. It just results in getting written off due to my age, diet and lifestyle
@mickyluv7 @V4VixVendetta I'm not surprised no one's jumping to argue with such intolerant, ignorant bastards
@Little_G2 no, I propose we live comfortably with our deterrents until one accidentally goes off and the whole planet is destroyed
@Little_G2 sure okay, off you trot back to your real world then.. Leave us Unicorns to take LSD and paint ourselves
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN I've never said I wanted free University tuition
@Little_G2  the "real world" where everyone stands in petrol and waves their matches around.. Sure, I'm the one with no grip on reality
@prankyDuck @Little_G2 nuclear weapons have hardly stopped the multitude of terrorist attacks in the past 20 years
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN who are you to decide which degrees benefit all?
@Little_G2 there is no evidence supporting this ridiculous "nuclear deterrent" notion if that's what you're implying
@SidneyAloysius  @B00B_DYLAN isn't it? What is it then? Please analyse the deeper secrets of life and put them into 140 characters
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN you're encouraging class divide there.. Also, it's not about having it paid for, it's about the extortionate cost
@SidneyAloysius and that too is minimal to Mr Osborne's borrowing
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN Â£6,000 is hardly "free"
@Little_G2 if we continue to use nuclear weapons there will be nothing to take care of, not a plant, or a deficit, or an animal.. Sweet fa
@SidneyAloysius tackle those keeping money in o/s accounts of their own first? Y'know, In this country? See what the deficit looks like then
@mickyluv7 @Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN another assumption based only on the ideologies bestowed upon you by society and mainstream media outlets
@Little_G2 I think it'd be silly to think otherwise
Come on guys, they're ASKING for it 
@findingfinlay just read all of this, it's ridiculous
@Little_G2 if you can justify renewing Trident THEN we can talk about where money is being wasted
@WelshTeacup @sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN I'm intrigued; what do you spend your time doing besides debating with teenagers online?
Walk away Sidney, you're going to get into a lot of trouble with all that ignorance  
@Little_G2 can you justify the renewal of Trident?
@WelshTeacup @sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN I'd like to think there'll be no tory party in 10/15 years.. Perhaps even electoral reform
@Little_G2 the tories have outlined their plans for ridiculous measures of austerity whilst you only have historical stuff on other parties
I guess it's a good job you'll never be welcome then  
@Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN what is the deal with you guys and swearing? Seriously.. Get over it!
@Little_G2 again.. Are you assuming I voted labour? Pretty foolish
@Little_G2 serious answer - who are we referring to here? You don't even know who I voted for
@findingfinlay horrific right? They all seem to find something funny about ganging up on a 19 year old and mocking his appearance too haha
@B00B_DYLAN @WelshTeacup @sassycassyL she's given a nationality to a piece of crockery laur, you don't have time for this
Says it all 
More ignorant statements about what men and women should look like  
Just some casual objectification // jokes about genderfluidity 

Feel free to call them out because I'm getting bored 
@SidneyAloysius take care, this wasn't personal.. And I forgive you for calling me a smelly vegan hippie or whatever
@archfarchnad but thanks for sticking up for me.. Sort of
@archfarchnad I've had 4 jobs
the current one has put me forward as guest of honour at a Royal Garden Party on Tuesday
I've achieved nothing
@mickyluv7 is this meant to be one of those "har har har it's funny because I implied he's homosexual" jokes? Just LOOK at that compassion!
@SidneyAloysius i'd argue it shows greater compassion to vote for a party that has more than just an elite few's monetary wellbeing in mind
So they mock my veganism and then ask me to justify what I do that's compassionate? Hmm idk.. Being vegan?
@SidneyAloysius and I'm trying to say that if there is nothing compassionate about voting for them then how am I wrong?
@mickyluv7 I'm obviously not "underdeveloped" but the lack of photos of you make it very questionable that you're in peak physical condition
@mickyluv7 care to expand?
Remember guys, I'M the child 
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN
@SidneyAloysius where is the compassion in voting for fracking, fox hunting, TTIP, welfare cuts and crippling foreign countries?
@_nancy_bae I think they're just mad because bedroom tax won't cover it
these people are proving just how compassionate the tory demographic are Feel free to jump in
they're here in numbers 
@sassycassyL @SidneyAloysius I'm sorry but is this going anywhere? Cos I've got trees to hug
@SidneyAloysius @sassycassyL isn't it obvious?
@sassycassyL  as soon as a tory voter can explain how their vote represents compassion I'll be happy to hear them out
@sassycassyL @SidneyAloysius I can take well articulated points about how I'm wrong, but you've offered none
@sassycassyL I can see no compassion in voting for the tories, also, please stop referring to me as a "child", old wench
@PyroLordOfFire this is coming from the TF2 character? Do you really think you're in a position to judge me?
@SidneyAloysius @sassycassyL no need to be condescending dear
@WelshTeacup  I'd like to question the "wildlife lover" bit of your bio.. Since being free-spirited and loving animals is so ridiculous
This is hilarious, look how mad they get 
@sassycassyL none of you have justified voting them to me so far.. You're all too keen to make personal attacks against me
@sassycassyL @WelshTeacup is my gender relevant? Yeah, it kind of is. Is my hair? Or where I live? Or my bio? No
@sassycassyL you right wingers are so quick to pull the "freedom of speech" card though?
@sassycassyL @WelshTeacup you realise I'm a guy yeah? Hahahaha
@sassycassyL have you no real argument to come back with? Is that your problem?
@sassycassyL less classy than voting for a party that wants to kill foxes and frack under homes and give corporations unstoppable power?
I walked into media 10 minutes late and my tutor said, in front of the whole class, "ah here he is! CND Malone"

How can we even trust an election after the Scottish referendum fix?

If you vote conservative how do you sleep knowing you support the murder of these poor animals for "sport"? 
Not true, if you don't vote and you make no efforts to improve your situation via other means THEN you have no right

You may have heard of the controversial 'Ban the Burka' but have you heard of the lesser known 'Formalise the Fedora'?
UKIP want to make fedoras mandatory
At 17 you may drive, you may donate blood, you may even apply for a pilot's license but YOU MAY NOT have a say in how your life is run
If you vote conservative you may as well just write "I have no compassion and can't see beyond my own privilege" on the ballot paper
This seems apt

@scifiglitter it's less about that though, with marginal differences between lab &amp; con the pressure of smaller parties can make a difference

The oldest public service broadcaster should just die already 
Don't let the fact that the Royal Family have working reproductive systems stop you from thinking about #FreddieGray
@pearlmystic I feel like there's something unhealthy about this calum darling
I just had cereal for the first time in 10 months, oh wow I've been missing out
All 'male oppression' stems from patriarchy and it's funny that people can't see that
Just a reminder that the Royal Baby's socks probably cost more than your whole wardrobe
A brief summary of everything wrong with the world 
You know what they call the royal baby in France? A Royale with appointees

By the way, when they say the bankers stole and gave themselves big bonuses, they mean the chief bankers, not Sue from your local branch
Fridge magnets are hideous.. They encourage people to put a pastiche of clashing concepts all over their home appliances
Essentially, since having their first child the Dutchess and Prince have gone on holiday and made another one.. How productive
Might as well just call her Kate Kiddleton
I just realised I have no idea what any of the Royal Family members surnames are
I feel like I've reached a new low, bring back the pics where I'm reading or drawing or doing something intellectual
It's 10:45, I've just gotten out of bed and I'm already taking over enthusiastic shots of me drinking soya milk 
They're literally sharing someone's private photos and acting like it's okay? ?? ?? ?  
@Daily_Star you're disgusting  you're disgusting you're disgusting you're disgusting you're disgusting 
I have to go into work today (I've never worked on the weekend before) but it's okay because my boss promised to bring croissants in
I'm an organ donor and I can't help but think that the NHS will be disappointed when they cut me open and realise I'm actually 80% houmous
The graphics in the new update of DayZ are amazing 
Kinda ridiculous how MPs call for only "skilled migrants" when Downing Street hasn't seen a PM do their job well in decades
@callumniall_ @neverlandkatie is that really the best you can do? No wonder you can't get your head around feminism
@callumniall_ @neverlandkatie you're full of shit mate, can't say you worded it wrong when you said you DISAGREE with it twice in one tweet

@milkypirate exactly
My parents came back from their holiday with this gift for me.. They're fully endorsing the Slice of Life lifestyle 
She skirted around the idea that essentially "kids these days" are weaker and can't cope like they should
My mum said something ridiculously ignorant about self-harm and how "no one did that when I was young"
I watched Age of Ultron yesterday and it was so so good
Freedom of speech is your right, but all-encompassing tolerance is your humanitarian obligation
I legitimately woke up this morning having had a nightmare about the whole thing
Freedom of speech is not 
Being racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, sexist, misogynistic, objectifying or intolerant in any way
Tonight I'm going out with my friends.. In town.. Scary stuff
People got money and extravagant gifts for passing their GCSEs, I've been formally invited to the Queen's pad and no one batted and eyelid

What's the phobia for when you're afraid of people self-diagnosing phobias? Because I think I have it
@muayfarang555 what exactly have I done wrong? Pointed out some of many genuine atrocities committed by the British?
How can anyone feel good in themselves when they treat other people with a snobby, haughty prejudiced attitude?
The bus driver gave me a reyt dirty look when I showed her my pass.. How do people get away with horrendous customer service?
Hatred of capitalism is preferred
Ideal candidates will have experience in being tolerant, and consider themselves intersectional feminists
Who wants to form a gang of "UKIP propaganda hunters"? 

We'll cruise around tearing their posters down and interrogating their campaigners
Isn't it sad that the only way people can feel united is in being part of a persecuted minority group?
It's sad because ignorance and rejection for the sake of rejection will often have life-changing consequences for members of the community
Of course marriage falls under LGBT+ rights but it's topical and the only way to get people to listen
People who vote against gay marriage/LGBT+ rights: congrats, you've voted against something that has no impact on your life
The media are relishing in this Ed Miliband shit because they know it's distracting young people from the real consequences of the election

The hottest possible state for something to be in (literally aflame) has caused my ears and nose to be cripplingly cold
And it's ironic because it's due to the fact that I had to walk home because of a FIRE
My ears are cold
@B00B_DYLAN is that meant to be a caravan because it looks like a jeep
Thanks
Your hair grew and you got sexy
What happened to me 
Only to be stopped by the police because of a huge forest fire.. Which meant I had to walk for an hour anyway
A lady who works in Morrisons Garage ended up giving me a lift home at quarter to eleven
What a fucking night!

Stupid woman at the bus stop sprang out of nowhere so the driver hit the brakes really hard and I headbutted the fucking window

I'm all tweeted out, it's been an intense week
I'm just gonna send people this picture when they ask what bands I like
A system cannot fail those it was never meant to protect (us)
David Cameron looks like he knows useless facts about different breeds of wildflower
Ed Miliband looks like he's constantly on the verge of talking about how he got 100% attendance five years running in Eton
Nigel Farage looks like the kind of guy who's favourite line is "you can't do that, it's against health and safety regulations"
The visual representation of when you're destroying someone in a Facebook argument so they get their friends involved 
If I was a girl and someone gave me flowers I'd be well pissed off, who said I was in the financial state to raise a bouquet?
I specialise in watching everyone else have a great Saturday night via social media
Next in my scope is Lockheed Martin
They will tell you when the bombs need blastin'
Don't think, just listen to the songs, keep dancin'
They call it warfare but your wars aren't fair
If they were there'd be suicide bombers in Arms Fairs

So did like.. No one listen to their parents when they said "don't talk to strangers online"? Because I'm pretty sure it's all any of us do
Somebody come do something with me today, preferably you'll have all the ideas, money and transportation

My neighbour just saw me and said "off out for the night is it?" to which I replied "no, just going up the shop" 
she seemed so disappointed
Wouldn't you rather make one person smile for a moment than make someone insecure for years?
Imagine if people put as much effort into being kind to people as they do in looking for reasons to be unkind to people
I implore you to ask who the real failure is
The one who chases a useless, conceptual product 
Or the man who sees the real currency in life
So when you have no interest in superficial, meaningless concepts of capital then you slip through the cracks and are branded a "failure"
The problem with the Western education system is that it's built entirely on teaching you to chase after money
It must be satire

if anyone with significant power in this world can justify causing our own extinction by using nuclear weapons then we deserve to be extinct
people are fragile things, you should know by now, be careful what you put them through
If you teach your daughter to be embarrassed to play with "boyish" toys then you're spreading gender-based oppression
If you teach your son to be embarrassed for liking "feminine" things then you're sowing the seeds of the perpetuation of patriarchy

I think one of the worst things about depression is when for no reason at all a dark cloud descends upon you and you feel empty to the core
Mocking vegans is funny because it helps you forget that you're justifying the death of animals

@kittynoise why not say "unbottled water" or "free water"?

@LiamTuckker exactly, because entertainment is a distraction
Why are footballers paid so much? 
Why do we make a big deal of A* students? 
Why do we have so many "talent" competitions and award shows?
The whole education system is based on creating competition because competition essentially distracts everyone from the true opposition

Farage needs to watch American History X
Maybe Farage used "controlled immigration" to deport it
I've seriously lost my chill this morning
And guess what most CEOs are? White old FUCKIN men
Countries are ideological concepts designed to divide people and create hostility
"Great Britain" is not even a real thing!! No more than if you decided to name different bits of your living room carpet
When I see people advocating racism and complaining about immigration I can barely resist the urge to scream YOURE ON A FUCKING ROCK
Who do we really need to think about deporting?
Migrant workers contribute more to the UK in tax revenue than they take in benefits 
Corporations destroy our planet and often pay no tax
@milkypirate unfortunately so, I often see them all over Facebook and I've even had some run ins at protests
It's got to the point where I don't ever want to use the word "immigrant" because endless propaganda has given it such negative connotations
They also show their support for "making Britain great again" by only ever buying clothes made in foreign sweatshops and going to Magaluf
Everyone I know who supports the idea of deporting migrants has only ever contributed tax through cigarettes, paid for with JSA
@arctics_monkeys I thought it had a nice ring to it
We're so obsessed with these temporary bodies of ours that we never take the opportunity to experience anything spiritual
eg. 
Obama being against inhumane "therapies"
Don't let the fact that some politicians are supporting BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS convince you to vote for them

Fell asleep watching DoomRT @marsjpg: Cameron has the power to do so much and his top priority is violent murder on innocent creatures for sport
@redbrowny31 I know man, that's the worst part.. Forced out onto the street to stop a protest they fully agree with
The police must be our allies for us to truly win, and it isn't even that difficult to achieve - the tories have consistently attacked them
@JeCanDance of course, I can't speak for any of them.. But I'd imagine it's someone who has a compassionate view of minority groups
@_Robertoo__ if you consider the fact that it's 35% of a 65% turn out (and 16/17 y/o can't even vote) it seems ridiculous
@_Robertoo__ what are you referring to there mate?
@JeCanDance I feel the real problem here is not that they have them, but the fact that they need them because people are so fed up
@_Robertoo__ it definitely is, I'm very suspicious of it though, perfect distraction from the real cause
@JeCanDance or their training needs to be amended at the very least
@JeCanDance of course not, but it's clearly not right to give them a weapon which can be used in such a way
@_Robertoo__ if activists did the same I'm sure someone would say that
@TheKirbyxox I know mate, please don't send me these any more, the pics are horrific and make me angry
@JeCanDance 
@TheKirbyxox I only get four pics mate, I can't possibly represent the whole thing.. But here's a better one 
@TheKirbyxox they use varying levels, it's still riot gear
@FaultyCivilian I agree, and I feel sorry for some of the officers because I'm sure they don't want to be there
@JeCanDance not where I live, regardless, if they can kill people with them.. And have done, why are they still issued?
@JeCanDance no, you're right, cos tear gas is invisible
However there are reports of its use in these riots, I was trying to convey sarcasm
@xTerahh  what about when protesters protect cops? Like in Baltimore; there are good and bad on either side, so why should one get weapons?
@FaultyCivilian I'm not trying to incite hatred towards cops, I just want to make people question their ability to "protect and serve"
@xTerahh @vhexspillow when has a police officer battering a protester ever helped a member of the public stay safe?
@JeCanDance have you ever seen either? There's tear gas clearly in one pic and batons and face guards in others
@xTerahh @vhexspillow they need to be prepared for self-defence, they don't need those batons.. Which have killed people
@ataliadelrio I'm not badmouthing, just offering food for thought - I would encourage you to experience the police at demos firsthand though
@FaultyCivilian @nesswilliamsx actually it's a protest - a riot suggests there's no reason or cause 
@ataliadelrio of course
however in many situations they are over equipped and it serves as an oppressive image that only encourages violence
That second pic shows cops using an incredibly painful pressure point on an activist who is clearly on the ground and outnumbered by the way
Activists turn up in cardigans &amp; jeans, cops turn up in riot gear &amp; carrying tear gas

Who really wants the fight? 
Houmous is a human right

How can they legalise a sport in which all you do is kill innocent animals? It's 2015 we're supposed to be more civilised than this
@TurbulentStoker it's still an unnecessary and very dangerous investment

@harrhun @SamuelFitt this "capitalist world" consists of the USA and us, things can change. Capitalism has failed everyone but the bankers
@harrhun @SamuelFitt ah the same old rhetoric of "money we didn't have" except your man Osborne borrowed more in five years
@harrhun @SamuelFitt this is not "top down" where have you been living for half a decade?
Nothing irritates me more than seeing privileged white tory teenagers
@harrhun @SamuelFitt are you for real? 
The only good thing about this is that nature will be forced to fight back and wipe out the horrendous parasites that we are

because it might actually represent the interests of the UK

@tinyfox_ ffi, be careful saying stuff like this
The painful truth
Please use what's left of your right to protest to fight this, because I guarantee you they'll find a way to take that away from us
I'm honestly fucking heartbroken

More food banks
More power to corporations
More banker bonuses

@kittynoise you GO!
@ me next time  
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili I don't see any need to be condescending, I'm not criticising you or having a go
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili a coalition would still need approval, I can't see it happening (in the hypothetical situation of a PR system)
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili we can only hope for the best, whatever that is
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili but labour would still have somewhere near 30% 
They wouldn't pass a ConKip coalition with such a high Lab %
@tinyfox_ I think it did ffi, I think it did
@itsjust_lili @BenMcKinlayMP in a PR system  10% would be nothing compared to the devastating effects of a landslide tory win
I wish I could blissfully go through life watching the soaps and eating takeaways and doing my ironing but NO I had to give a shit didn't I?
@BenMcKinlayMP @itsjust_lili that would be nowhere near as bad as a Tory win

@Little_G2  this is hardly comparable to nuclear war, he's consistently making attacks on me as a person despite my leaving the debate

@mickyluv7 @ccccclarkee @Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN mate.. You're like twice our age, shouldn't you be in bed by now?

@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN who are you to decide which degrees benefit all?
@Little_G2 there is no evidence supporting this ridiculous "nuclear deterrent" notion if that's what you're implying
@SidneyAloysius  @B00B_DYLAN isn't it? What is it then? Please analyse the deeper secrets of life and put them into 140 characters
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN you're encouraging class divide there.. Also, it's not about having it paid for, it's about the extortionate cost
@SidneyAloysius and that too is minimal to Mr Osborne's borrowing
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN Â£6,000 is hardly "free"

@SidneyAloysius tackle those keeping money in o/s accounts of their own first? Y'know, In this country? See what the deficit looks like then
@mickyluv7 @Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN another assumption based only on the ideologies bestowed upon you by society and mainstream media outlets
@Little_G2 I think it'd be silly to think otherwise
Come on guys, they're ASKING for it 
@findingfinlay just read all of this, it's ridiculous
@Little_G2 if you can justify renewing Trident THEN we can talk about where money is being wasted
@WelshTeacup @sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN I'm intrigued; what do you spend your time doing besides debating with teenagers online?
Walk away Sidney, you're going to get into a lot of trouble with all that ignorance  
@Little_G2 can you justify the renewal of Trident?
@WelshTeacup @sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN I'd like to think there'll be no tory party in 10/15 years.. Perhaps even electoral reform
@Little_G2 the tories have outlined their plans for ridiculous measures of austerity whilst you only have historical stuff on other parties
I guess it's a good job you'll never be welcome then  
@Little_G2 @B00B_DYLAN what is the deal with you guys and swearing? Seriously.. Get over it!
@Little_G2 again.. Are you assuming I voted labour? Pretty foolish
@Little_G2 serious answer - who are we referring to here? You don't even know who I voted for
@findingfinlay horrific right? They all seem to find something funny about ganging up on a 19 year old and mocking his appearance too haha
@B00B_DYLAN @WelshTeacup @sassycassyL she's given a nationality to a piece of crockery laur, you don't have time for this
Says it all 
More ignorant statements about what men and women should look like  
Just some casual objectification // jokes about genderfluidity 

Feel free to call them out because I'm getting bored 
@SidneyAloysius take care, this wasn't personal.. And I forgive you for calling me a smelly vegan hippie or whatever
@archfarchnad but thanks for sticking up for me.. Sort of
@archfarchnad I've had 4 jobs
the current one has put me forward as guest of honour at a Royal Garden Party on Tuesday
I've achieved nothing
@mickyluv7 is this meant to be one of those "har har har it's funny because I implied he's homosexual" jokes? Just LOOK at that compassion!
@SidneyAloysius i'd argue it shows greater compassion to vote for a party that has more than just an elite few's monetary wellbeing in mind
So they mock my veganism and then ask me to justify what I do that's compassionate? Hmm idk.. Being vegan?
@SidneyAloysius and I'm trying to say that if there is nothing compassionate about voting for them then how am I wrong?
@mickyluv7 I'm obviously not "underdeveloped" but the lack of photos of you make it very questionable that you're in peak physical condition
@mickyluv7 care to expand?
Remember guys, I'M the child 
@sassycassyL @B00B_DYLAN
@SidneyAloysius where is the compassion in voting for fracking, fox hunting, TTIP, welfare cuts and crippling foreign countries?
@_nancy_bae I think they're just mad because bedroom tax won't cover it
these people are proving just how compassionate the tory demographic are Feel free to jump in
they're here in numbers 
@sassycassyL @SidneyAloysius I'm sorry but is this going anywhere? Cos I've got trees to hug
@SidneyAloysius @sassycassyL isn't it obvious?
@sassycassyL  as soon as a tory voter can explain how their vote represents compassion I'll be happy to hear them out
@sassycassyL @SidneyAloysius I can take well articulated points about how I'm wrong, but you've offered none
@sassycassyL I can see no compassion in voting for the tories, also, please stop referring to me as a "child", old wench
@PyroLordOfFire this is coming from the TF2 character? Do you really think you're in a position to judge me?
@SidneyAloysius @sassycassyL no need to be condescending dear
@WelshTeacup  I'd like to question the "wildlife lover" bit of your bio.. Since being free-spirited and loving animals is so ridiculous
This is hilarious, look how mad they get 
@sassycassyL none of you have justified voting them to me so far.. You're all too keen to make personal attacks against me
@sassycassyL @WelshTeacup is my gender relevant? Yeah, it kind of is. Is my hair? Or where I live? Or my bio? No
@sassycassyL you right wingers are so quick to pull the "freedom of speech" card though?
@sassycassyL @WelshTeacup you realise I'm a guy yeah? Hahahaha
@sassycassyL have you no real argument to come back with? Is that your problem?
@sassycassyL less classy than voting for a party that wants to kill foxes and frack under homes and give corporations unstoppable power?
I walked into media 10 minutes late and my tutor said, in front of the whole class, "ah here he is! CND Malone"
I'm such a dork 
@rosa_jenkins DM me their profile and I'll do it
Cool story: the leader of the Green Party Wales ( @pippabartolotti ) gave me this badge at an anti-racism demo
Wear it with pride <VICTORY HAND> #Greens 
Surely a party with a pound sign logo should be enough to show you where the interests of it's MPs lie?
How can we even trust an election after the Scottish referendum fix?
No one even appreciates the cheekbones??
If you vote conservative how do you sleep knowing you support the murder of these poor animals for "sport"? 
Not true, if you don't vote and you make no efforts to improve your situation via other means THEN you have no right 
I get 30 retweets before I even get out of bed
You may have heard of the controversial 'Ban the Burka' but have you heard of the lesser known 'Formalise the Fedora'?
UKIP want to make fedoras mandatory
At 17 you may drive, you may donate blood, you may even apply for a pilot's license but YOU MAY NOT have a say in how your life is run
If you vote conservative you may as well just write "I have no compassion and can't see beyond my own privilege" on the ballot paper
This seems apt

At 16 you must pay adult fares, you may smoke, you may have sex, you may even get married
but YOU MAY NOT have a say in how your life is run
@FfionRadford even though a couple of the parties likely to gain power want to lower the age to 16
@scifiglitter they've been a pretty shitty local authority to be honest.. It's a shame
@scifiglitter labour win by a landslide here, every time!
The equivalent of saying UKIP aren't a racist party
Wanna come to my house party? It's not a fancy dress party but everyone who's coming will be in fancy dress
@B00B_DYLAN let me do a little analogy for this.. mhm.. just a moment
Nick Clegg has promised not to increase the battery life of smartphones... Triple the power! Awesome!
@scifiglitter it's less about that though, with marginal differences between lab &amp; con the pressure of smaller parties can make a difference
"young people don't care about politics" 
Yeah because all the old people vote the same old shit in every time
Johnny Marr doesn't like David Cameron so neither should you
Nigel Farage reminds me of King Herod
I'm opening my home up to any migrants if UKIP win, cos I'll be over the border faster than Nigel Farage can say something atrocious
Tomorrow Farage will be chain-smoking in an armchair, crying into his cheap British ale
If you're not gonna vote then at least get involved in direct action
Attend and organise peaceful protests, sign petitions, spread awareness

*a drunken working class man wandering home from the pub*

Ah I'd love a kebab.. 

Where are all the fucki.. 
Oh shit, I voted UKIP
Ed Miliband knows what it's like to be a uni student, his family are currently helping him pick a toaster for his new flat on Downing Street
David Cameron and Nick Clegg are currently dividing their record collection as they pack up 10 Downing Street
Don't think we forgot how much you supported the Greens
Peace and Russell endorse Labour and Ed becomes a meme &amp; suddenly you're all over it
I can't get

Option 2
Wasted votes do exist and that proves the system has failed, we need parliamentary and electoral reform: take to the streets
Option 1
There's no such thing as a wasted vote, the two main parties are just scared of the power smaller parties are gaining

I implore you to ask who the real failure is
The one who chases a useless, conceptual product 
Or the man who sees the real currency in life
So when you have no interest in superficial, meaningless concepts of capital then you slip through the cracks and are branded a "failure"
The problem with the Western education system is that it's built entirely on teaching you to chase after money

Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old
I've been on three courses of fluoxetine and a course of mirtazapine

@Tomas_Charlie thank you

I think one of the worst things about depression is when for no reason at all a dark cloud descends upon you and you feel empty to the core
Mocking vegans is funny because it helps you forget that you're justifying the death of animals

If all of The Killers' songs sounded like Everything Will Be Alright they'd probably be my favourite band
Bands who tweet that they'd call someone out for unsolicited groping or sexism at their gigs aren't noble, they're just human beings

@wa11fl0wer I'm a DJ and thought it'd be fun to have in a setlist
@kittynoise what about saying "tap beer" instead of getting bottles then?
@kittynoise why not say "unbottled water" or "free water"?
@wa11fl0wer I'VE LISTENED TO THREE DIFFERENT ONES FOR THE PAST 20 MINUTES CAN YOU PLEASE SPECIFY
I'm confused and bewildered by the way people specify "tap" water in pubs
Coachella looks like what John Green imagines a festival to be like
@howniceisuracc why ?
Political parties are like iPhones
they promise a lot, look different to the last one, lack structural integrity and spy on your every move
A side effect of cravings is pregnancy
@tomverse exactly! but it makes no sense, they believe Halal is "cruel" but don't recognise that a bolt gun is only a lesser of two evils
Am I really writing several tweets about my love for Dijon mustard? I'm so lame
@yeatssss Dijon is a luxury that can only be indulged in every so often anyway
@yeatssss I would recommend Dijon but that's a reward in itself
@tomverse then they're still just scapegoating the meat industry for the sake of racist ideals
because I want to pretend I have nothing to worry about
is there a way to block tweets with words like "revision" and "haven't done any" from your timeline
the real @Kurt_loves_me_2 died in 2012 but he was so popular that when The Sun hacked his phone they decided to keep tweeting for 3 years
@tomverse because to complain about the inhumane slaughter of animals in one way but endorse it in another makes no sense

Guys, you don't hate the feminist - you don't even hate feminism
You hate the fact that your ego has been made so fragile by patriarchy

Anorexia is not a piece of clothing that you can try on and take back, receipt in hand, asking for a refund
@LiamTuckker exactly, because entertainment is a distraction
Why are footballers paid so much? 
Why do we make a big deal of A* students? 
Why do we have so many "talent" competitions and award shows?
The whole education system is based on creating competition because competition essentially distracts everyone from the true opposition

Police brutality is now so blatant that it terrifies me to think of the things going on that AREN'T being captured on video
Often, elderly people have a severe lack of etiquette on public transport.. And it annoys me because they don't even pay to travel

Essex Dogs is my favourite Blur song, does that make me a fake fan?
@flvral I'm fresh out of references.. But can you blame me? You don't admit it.. But we've never seen eye to eye
@flvral it's twelve o'clock and I'm feeling shite, I can't go to the gig tonight
@pearlmystic just watch out for angry people who still don't know blur are better than oasis
@flvral get out of my face
@pearlmystic woah woah, careful calum, saying this kind of stuff could get you killed!
@flvral I bloody hope so, I just hope it's your bones that shatter.. Not mine
@flvral how could you say this to me? I'm clearly in pain over this, I hope their tour bus never leaves.. Cos I don't wanna see them on TV

Farage needs to watch American History X
Maybe Farage used "controlled immigration" to deport it
I've seriously lost my chill this morning
And guess what most CEOs are? White old FUCKIN men
Countries are ideological concepts designed to divide people and create hostility
"Great Britain" is not even a real thing!! No more than if you decided to name different bits of your living room carpet
When I see people advocating racism and complaining about immigration I can barely resist the urge to scream YOURE ON A FUCKING ROCK
Who do we really need to think about deporting?
Migrant workers contribute more to the UK in tax revenue than they take in benefits 
Corporations destroy our planet and often pay no tax
@milkypirate unfortunately so, I often see them all over Facebook and I've even had some run ins at protests
It's got to the point where I don't ever want to use the word "immigrant" because endless propaganda has given it such negative connotations
They also show their support for "making Britain great again" by only ever buying clothes made in foreign sweatshops and going to Magaluf
Everyone I know who supports the idea of deporting migrants has only ever contributed tax through cigarettes, paid for with JSA
@arctics_monkeys I thought it had a nice ring to it
We're so obsessed with these temporary bodies of ours that we never take the opportunity to experience anything spiritual
eg. 
Obama being against inhumane "therapies"

Farage now hates Scottish people too, he's really not picking wise targets
Oh fuck, she just blanket termed us as "the valleys"
Nigel Farage looks like a clown born into the wrong job
That thing Farage does with his eyebrows makes me feel sick
Look guys, turn off your TVs, they're all useless.. Go outside and get the real debates started
I fear I'll one day get so angry at my TV that my hair turns grey, my blood pressure reaches astronomical levels and I die
Farage is one of the fake Slim Shadys, sit the fuck down pal
Farage seems to perpetually be in that state of drunkenness where you think your opinions matter to people

@jdraStewart I wished this for all of my childhood and eventually circumstances changed and I was able to, it will happen if you want it
@pippabartolotti do you eat meat?
Being against animal testing&amp;being a meat eater is sort of like hating guns because they harm people but going out stabbing people every day
It's the new DP isn't it? god dammit, it's that bloody CND tattoo isn't it?
If the best argument you've got against me is that I'm too loving and care too much about all other living things then just don't bother
How could that possibly have any negative connotations?
I don't know if I missed something but aren't hippies compassionate, caring people who are against inequality and destroying the planet?
I'm not saying there's a direct correlation between eating meat and having a lower intelligence.. but this comment.. 
Gotta love meat eaters and their bullshit "facts" that help them sleep at night

Yesterday a Lib Dem voter, whilst sniffing Amyl Nitrite, had a go at me for disagreeing with nuclear arms and today their MPs scare monger
@markmcdsnp fantastic
Let's just point out that Wikipedia has been declared AS reliable as the original printed encyclopedias #bbcqt @bbcquestiontime
That guy on question time sounds like a Charlie Brooker character
This Eclipse is sick, bit early and everything but still.. Didn't think it'd be THIS dark!
@bbcquestiontime YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT CUTS BUT WON'T MENTION TRIDENT OR THE ARMS RACE IN GENERAL #bbcqt
Okay, question time is stressing me out and I'm only ten minutes in
If you don't know what Marxism is don't find out because your whole world will erode and resemble a George Orwell novel
I think I've just been employed without even applying for a job? 
Yeah 1.8million
@bbcquestiontime you say we have more jobs than ever before.. But how many of those are zero hour contracts? #bbcqt
@treesontoast it's all a big ploy to get people to buy green cardboard, the industry must be in trouble
Just chucking question time on because I haven't had enough confrontation for one night
@treesontoast I was actually referring to eclipses but I too have been known to shoegaze
People have been doing it for thousands of years

"@treesontoast: "what is the best way to watch the solar eclipse?" probably just look up"
His paw is unnervingly close to those scissors
Got some dank kush 
Je suis abbie
Seriously, he doesn't care about anything but food and the heater in the Slice of Life 
Be more chill, be aslan the cat chill 


I'm gonna tweet photographs of my favourite animals and places now to calm everyone down
If you're already together and you think "oh I'll just fuck her and see if I fancy any more"  then you've already made a fucking mistake
Hold on
you had sex with someone to try and figure out whether or not you had feelings for them whilst you were in a relationship with them?
Holy shit imagine how awkward things will be at Green Man
I read this in Harry Goldfarb's voice
Hey ma look at me! I'm in one of those indie twitter wars! Aw you're gonna be so proud of me ma! I told you I'd make it big!
Then from a moral and compassionate standing it's inconsiderate at best, from a feminist stance.. It's objectifying and dehumanising
If you get with someone, have unprotected sex in a week, go get emergency contraception the day after and break up with them on the way back
@thomasxwalker totally justified in that.. They both made a decision when it came to the pace of the relationship, it's a bit inconsiderate
@thomasxwalker I think it's all up to interpretation, if you make the conscious choice to have consensual sex you can't really say you're
@thomasxwalker I don't think that's the focus here
@thomasxwalker nah that's not justification, if you're willing to have unprotected sex whether or not condoms later show up is irrelevant
@yeatssss so rad! How big is it?
@B00B_DYLAN this is really cute and idk why
It's less about what the message is and more about how it's conveyed 

IF YOU SHOUT AT PEOPLE IN CAPITALS THEY DONT WANT TO TAKE IT ON BOARD
When you don't wash your dishes.. Well it's a bit like communist russia
So everyone who tweets about Aidan gets retweeted and I get unfollowed
is it because I make a valid point and don't resort to petty insults?
Something we all need to fight, why wouldn't a man stand up for the recognition of women being people?
I'm actually really glad that female feminists are often critical and suspicious of male feminists because it proves that patriarchy is -
I'm fed up with twitter
@mikaylaesthetic as a white, cis male I acknowledge all my privilege and it spurs me on the fight it
If your "attempt to promote veganism" embarrasses and tars many vegans whilst also alienating people from the Green Party then yeah it's bad
@peacockdreamzz @yeatssss Oh my god, seriously? You can't compare our civilised, highly-intellectual understanding of morals with an animal
Why do I want you to quit funding the meat industry? So when I'm eating a cruelty free meal &amp; on twitter I'm not subject to horrific images
I think Aidan should just give up with the meat industry comparisons, he's too much of an easy target
Sometimes I think I should cut down on carbs and sometimes I think I'm pasta point of no return
If I put my hair like this can I be in a cool club of peace fans who vote green and are going to Green Man 
If anyone points out we're out of toilet roll I'm going to be pissed ((pun goddam intended))
When you have a great taste in films and an equally great taste in t-shirts 
Why is the Tent in a Tube from That's So Raven not a real thing
Fo shizzle, not to be confused with fascism
The cat just followed me up the shop
@henryjhutchins from about 8:30 to 10:30 tomorrow morning! 


Relationship advice? 
Find someone who wouldn't be embarrassed to walk the cat with you
Yesterday a LIBERAL Democrat voter called me a "leftie bastard"
I brought up David Cameron leaving his child in a pub in a class debate and our college tutor laughed but tried to hide it
Robin Thicke has a big Oedipus Complex
I just have this image of him being like "soze wvat you're saying iss my art iss goood and zey are in the wrong?"
When Hitler was rejected from Art College in Vienna what would have happened if a Marxist had told him how corrupt the education system is?
I feel SkyNet need to send someone back to sort Farage out, I don't mean kill him of course.. Just deport him, it'd be wonderfully ironic
@bethsymons_ I must track him down
Yesterday I walked past a woman and her child and all I heard was "no Daniel, you don't want to go to prison" 
"*giggling* I doooo!"
Dear Future Husband? 
How about Dear Meghan Trainor's Past Career Advisor 


@__hnah you need to make a special device 
Oh god, remember those days when people used to post their "munch" or "munchies" for the evening on Facebook?
"I don't like foreigners"

But you do like

German beer
Italian cars
Japanese TVs
Indian takeaway
American smartphones
Swedish dance music
I want to be outside on a mountain, with a fire and cups of coffee during the eclipse
I want a cassette player for the Slice of Life
@_DevenBaker I forgive you and I love you, I hope that makes you curl into the fetal position whispering 'no homo' and sobbing into a fedora
@GALACTICMAMI what about fake food? How can it be food if it's never been eaten? Duhhhhh
@yeatssss this is golden
Fuck off 
I'm becoming Winston Smith
I keep having terrifying dreams about rats
@GALACTICMAMI what the fuck, no way
You don't know pain until you say "ear" but you live in Wales and are alienated by everyone saying "yur"
Imagine if one day, instead of a rapture or second coming to prove God's existence.. Just without any warning twitter verified his account
I think I'm just upset, that "quote" is not profound, it should be common sense.. And not just "your girl" (possession anyone?) but everyone
Crikey! Nothing stops this one ranting! 
The rag and bone guy is droning on again, why don't they employ an eloquently British BBC docu style commentator to operate the megaphone?
People on the other side of the world could make my phone vibrate itself off the table and break by simply favouriting a tweet
I'm sure you're all familiar with the butterfly effect, but what about this crazy new notion: the notification effect -
Asking the real questions since 2013 
@SimplyLauraHere c'est magnifique!
But I forgave him and told him to take it easy and have a good night because to spread positive energy is to receive positive energy
The taxi driver told me he'd do it for Â£15 and as soon as we were halfway to my drop off he rang it up as Â£17 the bastard
@witchwhore thank you! x
Like really? What do you think?
Someone asked if I supported the campaign for nuclear disarmament movement, when I was dressed like this.... 
OK sorry sorry sorry I just overthink these things
But then.. Are you insulting them? Or are they getting insulted? Without intention to insult you can't be blamed for insulting
Well, more accurately, you can insult everyone with something
And if connotations are variable person to person then you can theoretically insult anyone with any word
So when only connotations carry meaning then words are inherently meaningless
Interestingly(&amp;controversially) word combinations like "child predator" can be used innocently;
a lion cub is essentially a "child predator"
Yesterday we got into a deep discussion about the difference between rhetoric and connotation, we concluded that there are no bad words
30% of the time you'll find my tweets contain statistics
I hope you guys realise I came up with this gem
I just got added to a list and it's really sweet, aw
I've lost my tea ffs
It worries me that people don't even know that it started as an anti-war anti-nuclear CND event
If you want a real campaign regarding Glastonbury how about we bring back the real meaning of it 
Why don't you GlastonBURY your pretentious attitude and accept the fact that Kanye is headlining and you're not changing that
I wish everything smelled like this tea omg
What a beautiful day for drinking good tea 
OH MY GOSH
that's another tweet that needed an Oxford comma ffs @arzE I now understand why you wrote the song
And why don't I do it? Because my short attention span (similar to a butterfly (see prior tweet)) means I concentrate on Twitter and forget
If I tweet about something I don't seem to end up doing it i.e making a hot beverage
Please don't go please don't go I love you so I love you so
I think I'm slightly scared of everyone
Especially if it's a guy, like they should see what they put their mothers through before they open their ignorant mouths
Don't ever let anyone say shit about stretchmarks
Me: loses drink and let's it go cold

Me: drinks a drink someone else made in seconds and probably wants another
Me: takes an hour to get around to making a hot drink

Me: expects it to take seconds when someone makes me a drink
Fun fact: Shaun of the Dead taught me what "exacerbate" means
This is a genuine issue for me and I have no idea why the postal service would care about my letterbox to hand efficiency
when the postman/lady puts the stuff in the letterbox &amp; you have to wait until they're out of earshot cos you don't want to sound too eager
If she looks after bees, she's a keeper (aw man, what a fantastic pun)
oh yay i won the lottery i am so happy.
What a beautiful day!
@ccccclarkee some people are entirely underwhelming
@ccccclarkee I have a car and have passed my theory but haven't had the money at the moment to sit my practical
why do people make a huge deal when they pass a multiple choice exam in 50 minutes, where you know all the questions 
I would love to have the time to do nothing for a while
Just like everyone else you've discovered horoscopes are the new hip trend so be sure to... 
@nokatieno I saw this just after I tweeted my last tweet... Weird...
She may contain the urge to run away, but hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
If you've seen the green man line-up it may be worth putting your drug orders in in advance. This one's gonna be triiIiIIIiiippyyyyy
I met a guy who looked just like Bob Dylan yesterday and I wasn't sure whether or not to say something
I have so much work to do that I can't go into college
I implore anyone who hasn't already to listen to Public Service Broadcasting
I often feel like the only Super Furry Animals fan left
There are many people I hope do not come to Wales for the festival, stay in your lanes you pretentious dix
"I want to cry" are not a band by the way.. That was a brief moment where I should've given a fuck about an Oxford comma
Or when they had Beirut! 
HOWEVER they do have Public Service Broadcasting and I want to cry
Green Man line up is good but you'll never beat 2011 when they had Fleet Foxes or 2010 with Billy Bragg

"We" = Tory fat cats, private health firmsâ¦
The most important thing to do is forgive him, the poor guy is very misled, he said he's voted lib dem since he was sixteen the poor sod
To which I replied "no more tax evading corporations making bad, watered down coffee? What ever would I do!" and he just sniffed his poppers
My personal favourite bit was when I said about global disarmament and he said "there'd be no more Starbucks Coffees for you" hahahahahahaha
[    to the tune of Green Eyes by Wavves     ] Greeeeen Man, I need to gooo to youuu
The one guy said to him "this man has got more compassion than you'll ever have" and it was nice
ALSO this guy who was sniffing Amyl Nitrite every ten seconds tried to get into a fight with me because I'm CND, they all stood up for me
They were mostly film scholars too so we spoke of David Lynch and Orson Welles and we made funny intellectual references
Yesterday I met a load of new people and ended up in a pub chatting about four dimensional objects and three dimensional shadows until 2am
@moonageddream the entire ecosystem depends on it!
@moonageddream legit going to save him 
@moonageddream Oh I'm sure he'll appreciate being an afterthought  !
Editing websites is such hassle when the college network drops all the time

@wa11fl0wer  i think I'm more concerned about all those poor trolleys!
@wa11fl0wer arguably all physical money is worthless! I'm sure there's some convenient side effect of this though
I've been awake for 26 hours, Jack.. Not so much

Leave your bad vibes at the door to my caravan
This is such a cool remix 
Actually.. unless they're giving you free alcohol and narcotics upon entry then I don't see the point in going into any room
Seriously, 18+ gigs are stupid.. like I'm 18+ and unless they're giving you free alcohol and narcotics upon entry then I don't see the point
The end goal in furnishing my house is to make it indistinguishable from a tattoo parlor, a squat and a crystal castles gig
That 7 was a complete accident but it's kinda?? ed7gy??
New Twent7y One Pilots track is rad as heck
Books are just under 4,000 years old and you tell me you "don't read"????

When life gives you lemons that are contaminated with gamma radiation, then you've got a real problem
I can think of a million things that are more impractical than lemons
eg half a garlic clove, a single hundred and thousand, a cockroach leg
I wonder how the "when life gives you lemons" thing came about.. Like that's such a random thing to say
When life gives you lemons make sure they're ethically produced and not made in sweatshops are they tested on animals? I hope they're not GM
Okay, a few errors here.. This analogy of impending extinction is based on observations in the early 20th century
@pallasades Baudrillard commented on  Ernst Mary's research - That's obviously my mistake, Mayr was around 100yrs ago 
@pallasades this was something I was researching, I believe it was Jean Baudrillard who made the link.. I can't remember, I'll find it later

Humans have been around approximately 100,000 years

The answer's no, if we all learnt to be happy in our own company there would be no need for human interaction, which we are innately craving

B) are adaptations of Nick Hornby books 
C) have pixies on the soundtrack

The 68 year old cleaner at my office pointed at a cafetiere and said "could you put that 'gadget' away please dear"  GADGET bless her aw
@flvral I wanted something with either Christian Bale or Jared Leto in it, I've lowered my lofty expectations of suggestions
@flvral Hmmm, potions are a bit hard drugs when I'm after softcore mild to enhanced moderate use of frowned upon lower class substances
@flvral it also needs occasional use of mild narcotics
I want a film with a great cast, elements of drama, action, comedy and bromance, a fantastic soundtrack and a guarantee to blow my mind

Why would you choose to not care about politics? These people literally control how you live your life, that's not going away by ignoring it
I have no issue whatsoever with comparing political parties to serial killers
Saying a party is the best because the others are so bad is like condoning a serial killer because he kills significantly less than others
Like they've already fucked up in several places around the world, they've joined neo-liberal coalitions and voted in favour of war and NATO

@charlxtte_ it's something I encounter every day, it's so frustrating
Like, by all means take care of eachother but don't exacerbate patriarchy by trying to use it as a means of coming on to a girl
I think that is a real problem, men and boys think they depend on certain aspects of inequality to come across as "caring" and "sweet"
Don't talk about feminism because I like pretending that saying "let me know when you're in safe" is romantic as opposed to necessary
Don't talk about asylum seeking and global tyranny because it's easier for me to see all immigrants as lazy, useless drains on society
Don't talk about government spying because it's easier for me to pretend my iPhone is just for snapchat and instagramming my lattes
Don't talk about the meat industry because it's easier for me to just imagine it comes out of nowhere
People don't like it when others raise awareness of social issues because it creates a crack in their facade of privileged ignorance

I think everyone should be angry about this irrespective of gender and social status
Essentially, women are paying extortionate prices for necessary products so that privately educated, privileged white men can get drunk
Oh and that's Â£1.4 million of TAX PAYER money, you know.. To add insult to injury
But alcohol is still stacked at the front of supermarkets, advertised on TV and endorsed by the House of Commons who spend Â£1.4m on it
34% of NHS funding is spent on treating substance misuse - yet in Scotland alone 71% of people seeking treatment for drugs are male
You know the world is a mess when bread isn't taxed because it's deemed NECESSARY and tampons and pads are taxed because they're ACCESORIES
I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide :/
Self-doubt is the worst aspect of my life
@littl3victories I don't know if you'd be into it but Jim Guthrie's (@jampants) stuff is awesome!
Ffi just told me about how she uses the "fire gun" (flamethrower) on GTA
So basically what I'm saying is, please don't think me rude when I can't get past this anxiety enough to simply say "you're welcome"
I don't mind holding the door open for anyone, I don't mind being thanked for it.. But for some strange reason I am far too shy to respond

If ur about to criticise someone's decision not to eat meat remember to stop &amp; think 'hang on nothing I can say will make any logical sense'
I've done nothing but write about complex topics for the past six hours, I would like to lie down now and have someone read aloud to me
(THAT'S A BIIIIG PLEASE AND THANK YOU)
I'd love it if you'd give this a read! 

@princefeminist No, it's a diagram of what companies own other companies - but I think most of them do anyway
My mind is blown 

Shit just got deep 
The more I write, the more disillusioned I become to my own existence 
In order for someone to tell me that I exist then they must be certain that they exist, and no one can be certain of any reality
If I decide that I don't exist then no one can really prove me wrong
"Am I real?"
"Is anything real if I haven't directly experienced it with my senses? How can I verify the existence of my senses?"
This whole postmodernism essay could be summed up with a "Smokes weed once" meme
How can I write an essay on a topic that makes me think more about how I may not actually exist?
Why oh why did I choose to write my media essay on postmodernism 
The fact that you were born white and male is purely one of several possible realities - think about that next time you're sexist/racist
If you take care of freedom, truth will take care of itself
Happy International Women's Day!

I already work for a children's charity, I was nominated for a Pride of Britain award and I'm literally having tea with the Queen in May
I just want to be happy and I don't care how many sanctions they threaten me with, grades come second to mental health and stability
Why have we gotten to the point where it's not about what you learn along the way but which letter an exam board designates to you?
The temptation to drop out and do something that matters is almost unbearable
It's not even the tutors, it's the admin staff they're rude and condescending and it creates a negative environment that I can't cope with
But no, they insist on making it more difficult by constantly having a go at me and belittling my real world issues
If the college would get off my back about attendance and let me sort my mental health out then I could easily get back into the routine

Graham Norton seems like a lovely guy, I just can't sit through his show
Eastenders just looks fucking stupid when they try to make the advert all dramatic and thriller like
SKA! IS! NOT! DEAD!
So if something can simultaneously exist and not exist then is time really a law? Or a concept?
At least in your perception.. If you could move between planets so fast that the light of the end of the earth never reached you
If you moved from planet to planet during the destruction of the earth, getting further away each time then you could keep it alive forever
I'm kind of hooked on this episode now though????
GOOD FUCKING WHAT AM I I just realised I've been watching Waterloo Road for the past 40 minutes
We clearly lack the sophisticated elegance of a capitalist family
If that's not elitism I don't know what is, I showed it to my mum and she said it was probably only good for smashing a shop window to loot
I played one once and legitimately won a "golf tee remover"
Capitalism is playing those ten pence machines at the arcades
Don't give me a funny look when I say "shan't" and "whom"
If everyone's so focused on "keeping Britain British" then tea should no longer be something you pay for and bring back the fog

I think everyone should read obituaries every day to keep themselves level-headed and remind them of the importance of every waking moment
@flvral it's like a postmodern gem, I love it, I love the way it portrays the world, I love the colour palette, the film stock.. Everything
@flvral that sounds cool, have you seen Her? It's an amazing film, Spike Jonez is so rad
