It's a personal problem if you give a shit about anything I do because I sure as hell don't give a shit about your opinion
Idc if you disagree with what I do, say, think, act or dress. I will do what the fuck I want and if you don't like it that's your problem
@Youphilnme same Shillip same. My wife better have huge ass tits.
I hate the fact I've been "family-orientated" and "hopeless romantic" all my life and I blame it on the sims.
I can only hope my husband will adore me like men in books.
True shit <TWO HEARTS> 
I just want shit to be easy.
I will never truly get what I want and that makes me so sad
What happened to all my friends?
Having a meltdown.
Going to have such a hard time on my own.

@spookymariaa oh god
@spookymariaa I didn't see the original tweet but I wish I did so I can comment on it
Miley is literally trying so hard to change the world for better and all people care about is how she dresses and acts on stage
@spookymariaa *deletes tweet*
Finally a debate where someone doesn't get all hurt about it 
Miley is an amazing human being regardless if you agree with what she wears and does.
Why it's so easy to love Miley Cyrus <TWO HEARTS> 
Every other group already prepped ingredients for culinary and my whole group was missing yet we still got shit done faster
@Princess_Kiana7 stay humble love <TWO HEARTS>
@Princess_Kiana7 that's why it's important to think before you speak because you never know
@Princess_Kiana7 talking so negatively about them.
@Princess_Kiana7 even then, you don't understand the impact of your opinion in people's minds. Remember people have killed themselves for
@Princess_Kiana7 people like that is not okay.
@Princess_Kiana7 your face at all? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Everyone is beautiful in their own way and talking so down about
@Princess_Kiana7 just imagine how you'd feel if you were born differently and someone else thought you were so ugly. But you didn't choose
@Princess_Kiana7 people do not get to choose their looks or face or body. That's how people are born.
@Princess_Kiana7 I love that you carry yourself so high girl but looking down on others because of it is not okay at all. Especially since
@NeilArmsbong I know it is, but I believe there will be a day where it'll either get better or tear the U.S. Apart
@NeilArmsbong of course nothing will be completely eliminated from thoughts but for equality with the law that is possible
@NeilArmsbong yes, but we have came so far and are continuing to do so, which is the same for equality of races
@GetEmSkeeter I didn't take it offensively, just wanted to put some logic in your joke and ruin it<SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
@NeilArmsbong people had the idea that women weren't equal? But look at where women are today
@vickyBeanMr ducking protects my eyes though
@GetEmSkeeter humans are also animals..
@GetEmSkeeter humans are racist against other humans, that's like a pug being racist to a bulldog, not to a cat
@NeilArmsbong I know it's not, but it is proof that change can happen
@GetEmSkeeter dogs are a totally different species though. That's like saying sharks are racist against humans <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@NeilArmsbong @SpliffMeister accomplished
@NeilArmsbong @SpliffMeister don't say never. Females were thought of so differently back then and with time look at what we as humans have
@RobynMoya yes please

So upset
Today literally could not go worse right now
Bet the fights tonight are fixed

So the security guard at vms who told me I can't park here to pickup my brother was just an asshole and had no law backing him up:-)
Read all the NM statutes on handicap parking only to find out that no where it states you have to get out of the car to be able to park here

@Palassyo that destruction is going to make people respect anyone
@Palassyo protesting is a process. Change doesn't happen fast whatsoever. Going into a protest people should know that. There is no way
@Palassyo I've seen plenty of messages sent out with protesting. I see no justification for destroying everything around you and stealing
Putting innocent people in danger is not a way to seek justice over another innocent life lost.

@_britaniaaa they've been involved for a long time it's just I don't see why all of a sudden they wanna be fucks
@_britaniaaa months, we'd be chill
@_britaniaaa it was better off this way. If it wasn't for Yates and jaramillo all of a sudden trying to control what we've had planned for
Yall acting like we only have one prank
Oh well, seniors get to go just chill at los tomorrow instead of school which is cool I suppose
@_britaniaaa los security and our security wouldn't let us in if we didn't get permission
@_britaniaaa for this kind you do, especially since los Lunas seniors were involved
Everything was perfect when sara was planning this and thanks to jaramillo it's all fucked. She should've left us alone like we planned.
@_britaniaaa we needed permission from only one person and we got it. And that one person fucked it up for us all, it's not our choice
@_britaniaaa it wasn't originally ran by the school. Only one admin knew about it and she fucked it up for everyone it's not a prank anymore
@krause_bailey just take her with us we can get turnt with her

@LookinAssss Adam has different opinions all the time I've never thought he was an ass and always respect his opinion
@red_X_Wing lmao, like I said, having feelings for ONE situation, does NOT mean I'm sensitive man

@red_X_Wing I do give a shit! Or I wouldn't be bothered?
<FROG FACE><HOT BEVERAGE>️ 
@Evan_The_KiDD no he was just being a dick because he thinks it's funny
@red_X_Wing @LookinAssss having feelings for someone being a dick doesn't make someone sensitive it makes them human
@Evan_The_KiDD I never once was rude though like rio, I even told Adam I appreciated his opinion, Id never be mean to be funny
@LookinAssss really am not that sensitive, if you haven't noticed I never give a fuck about anything but u just don't know when its too much

@AdamJCoughlin work here because there is no facts of that.
@AdamJCoughlin yeah we are pretty sure american teens would be stupid as fuck and it wouldn't work but we cannot state facts that it won't
@AdamJCoughlin but this obviously works im the majority of places, not just one. So you cannot say it won't work here because we do not know
@Evan_The_KiDD lol what?
@AdamJCoughlin American teens aren't the only ones in this entire world who like to get fucked up.
@AdamJCoughlin facts that other countries don't do so because you do not know unless you did crazy research or lived there. Pretty sure
@AdamJCoughlin mindsets. Irish people drink to get fucked up, I can assure you americans aren't the only ones who do so! And you can't state
@AdamJCoughlin im not saying we should be like that. And you really cannot speak for other countries like that because you do not know their
@AdamJCoughlin can you, off the top of your head, tell me the stats on alcohol abuse for each country? I'm sure you don't fully understand

@AdamJCoughlin like all the republicans would let that happen<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It's actually even allowed that if you're above 6 in the UK you can drink in your own home :-)
@simplysonyaa what about the teens who are allowed to drink at 16 in other countries, why is it so wrong for us but for them it's chill?
Funny bc in other countries drinking age is as low as 16, they seem to be doing fine <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AdamJCoughlin I guess I just don't know that age level yet! Oh well, Id hate for them to lower it though
@AdamJCoughlin I guess I've just yet to meet mature 21 year olds
@simplysonyaa lowering the drinking age will only give easier access. Do you actually know how many teens already drive drunk?
@AdamJCoughlin no but 21 year olds are seriously not much better than 18 year olds
@AdamJCoughlin but still, 3 years is nothing
@AdamJCoughlin so true, but what will make me in 3 years be more responsible than I am now??
