@vinegarcat you've been putting up a lot of these recently and I'm equal parts furious and concerned?? Like, why is this necessary???
Like, whoever thought of sports anime: nice job!! But I also hate you, because what have you done?¿ I used to have friends??¿ And a life¿??
@runge_kelly aww it is! Errybody &lt;3
My new internet friends are honestly so cute and cool and I just wanna snuggle 'em all, like, go you for being so rad
Alriiight! First day of training! Wish me luck! I'll be back in 7 hours
Bro, I don't even LIKE basketball but this anime is hella rad
I'm not really hungry, but I guess I should eat dinner...
*grabs a bag of baby carrots and a bottle of sweet tea*

Omg I can't believe a Smoothie Twitter favorited @FoolishSpoon 's tweet about her and @samiedraws 's smoothies brb screaming
If you have a cat PLEASE consider getting a snap-collar, bc cats can do weird stuff and suffocate and I don't want your cats to die, okay?;;
@runge_kelly Welp. I'll be 20 in a little over a month. Bam.
@FoolishSpoon @samiedraws I've accepted my fate
@FoolishSpoon @samiedraws I don't see why not
@vinegarcat @FoolishSpoon this party is sounding better and better ngl
Honestly, Meredith should be honored to have me on Snapchat 
Notice: when I start snapping you the REALLY UGLY faces, just know that you will never escape this friendship. Ever. Don't even try.

@Jessidgy *drags hand down face* yessssss
My parents are really good at forgetting their only child's name and confusing my name with a number of relatives and pet names. Incredible.
My mom's awesome, so I wanted to make her laugh for Mother's Day. It totally worked. 
omg I just realized that one of the very first versions of my story's first chapter is on my DeviantArt jfc it was so bad ;;;
Free! a summary: a bunch of cute, wet nerds who prompt feelings and cause odd, unconscious vocal tics. Also, there's swimming.
Kinda wanna rewatch Haikyuu!! For the third time....
@PrinceCanary 
"A xeno with a toast family!"

No, seriously, this movie gives me life
If you've never seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding, please do, it rocks my world every time, and I need to share these feelings with someone ;;;
I just wanted to watch a show about wet, shirtless, anime boys, I didn't sign up for feELINGS.
Finished! I'm now fully certified to serve alcohol (in an establishment where food is the primary means of service + income). KACHOW!

@Jessidgy !!!!!!!
My cute little gem fam always makes me smile. It's nice, you guys rule <HEART DECORATION>
AMAZING commission from nuffedilla.art on Instagram!! Go give her some love!! These are my babies Jesse and Zeke 
Studies show that the feeling of wanting to squeeze cute things is because our brains, quite literally, can't handle the cute. Incredible.
Omg all 3 high schools surrounding my new job have graduation during opening week jfc
Me: Oh, yeah, my dad's from South Africa
Some asshole: ....but¿¿?.....you're white??¿¿?

@CanisLupusSif @GarrettMassey -.-
@GarrettMassey @CanisLupusSif no that's the 10% actual garbage gene ;P
@GarrettMassey @CanisLupusSif you severely underestimate my level if shipping trash, son. How can you not see the signs???
@CanisLupusSif @GarrettMassey what so I'm 50% shipping trash 45% awkward hand gestures and 5% everything else??? I think not
@runge_kelly more room for new stuff :P
@GarrettMassey shhhh *awkwardly flails arms*
I am 50% shipping trash, 10% actual garbage, 20% anxiety, 5% salt, and 15% awkward hand gestures


@CanisLupusSif you are so welcome join me in sweaty anime boy hell
"You were my new dream." HAHA MY HEART?? YES. YOU CAN HAVE IT. WHAT DO I NEED THAT SILLY THING FOR ANYHOW??
@vinegarcat :(((((((
The only background I'll ever need @Jessidgy 
@runge_kelly omfg I HATE Fox News jfc uuurgh
So, I walked into my dad's office to tell him I found some desk options and he was HAVING A DANCE BATTLE WITH ANOTHER PLAYER IN DESTINY JFC
@samiedraws I will, brother
@TheAnglophiler omg but they bought this at a MUSEUM. THIS IS BEING SOLD ALONGSIDE PRINTS OF FAMOUS ARTWORK I'M SCREAMING
Yeah, my parents know me too well...;;; 
My parents always get confused when I say 'Mjolnir' and I'm just reminded that most people don't actually know Thor's hammer's name ;;;
@PrinceCanary well in that case how about you just help out with shipping, you can have it XD
May the Fourth be with you!!
@PrinceCanary omg, Rhett. *squints* I can't tell if you're joking or not...
@Jessidgy it was supposed to be a flunge??? But that is not what a flunge looks like and I'm laughing so hard XD
I love looking at fencing reference pictures because sometimes you just strike gold 
Have more Spider-Gwen bc I have an intense need to draw her rn (and working on anatomy at the same time...;;;) 
Spider-Gwen sketch that I actually kinda like...anatomy is still meh but whatever! ;;; 
@runge_kelly for sure still annoying though haha
Do I need two of these egg-bacon-and-cheese bagels? No. Am I gonna eat two of them anyway? You bet your sweet ass I am
@runge_kelly that's okay the damage wasn't too bad luckily
Just spent the last hour scrubbing the dryer down with alcohol bc a blue pen magically ended up in my WHITES and BROKE. RIP ME.
@samiedraws @RaposaBranca13 @Jessidgy I will hem your pants and protect you from other big people
@Jessidgy no no being big sucks no one sells pants that are long enough and airplanes are a hassle
I found this paperweight of @PrinceCanary 's true form, sans plaid and an axe, apparently 
@Jessidgy *hugs across a bunch of states*
You know what's cool? Vaccinating your kids for life threatening illnesses. Because you know what's NOT cool? The IRON LUNG. KTHANKS.
@Meredithicus yeah it was actually really not that hidden?? I don't know why I failed so hard *shRUG*
@runge_kelly that works
@runge_kelly hmm maybe like slow approach with some hip action to Roxanne or something XD I honestly don't even know
@Jessidgy CONFIRMED, if you will
@Jessidgy omg yes this is exactly what would happen
@Jessidgy NOW I'M THINKING OF THAT LILO AND STITCH SCENE WHERE NANI IS ALL 'GRAVITY IS CRUSHING ME' AND LILO'S LIKE 'STOP BEING WEIRD'
*Cleans out closet for the first time in forever* *finds that pearl necklace from the first guy I dated* this could help me buy my new desk
One time I was being a little brat so my grandpa put me in the birdbath 
@Jessidgy what about, like, Hyper and Black Opal cleaning the house and Rhodo being scared of the vacuum noises
@fishyspacetuna ooookay I guess that makes sense...
@fishyspacetuna that's....soweird??? Why????
I just realized that people with 20/20 vision can, like, SEE EVERYTHING when they shower or go swimming, like, that must be so cool???
@samiedraws I'm sure you'll look good with any haircut!! But I feel you, I was terrified the first time I cut all my hair off
@fishyspacetuna :( oh no! I'm sorry! I hope you get some rest and feel better soon!!
This is such a great emoji and it expresses my emotional state, like, 24/7 
＿ﾉ乙(､ﾝ､)_
Damn, it's like looking in a mirror
@runge_kelly but you are so small and the US is so large *mother hen noises*
@runge_kelly omg that's so many states it's dark little one you could get hurt
My best friend and go-to superhero-movie-watcher has to live in TEXAS. and already SAW IT. TWICE.  ＿ﾉ乙(､ﾝ､)_
@Jessidgy @PrinceCanary @vinegarcat I'm laughing so hard rn omg my cat is so mad
@runge_kelly @RaposaBranca13 omg aww and we all have glasses too it's perfect!! This is actually helping me calm down a little *hugs*
@RaposaBranca13 thanks, Branca, you get me *hugs*
Man, I shouldn't have started on this I'm so mad now remembering the dumb shit people have said to me jfc
@runge_kelly @RaposaBranca13 the people I tell are like 'does that mean you can reproduce with yourself???' And I just wanna scREAM HAHAHAHA
Like, my school spends months telling me that sex is bad and when I'm like 'oh, I don't want that' they're like 'whAT? YES YOU DO!' Smh
I've honestly just stopped telling people I'm asexual because what's the point if they won't believe me anyway, right? *SELFFIVE*
Friendly reminder that just because someone looks like they SHOULDN'T have self-image issues, doesn't mean that they DON'T, okay? Good.
@GarrettMassey one day my son
@GarrettMassey mine's like 'a whole pizza' Fuck yeah go for it' and I'm like 'k' and it's like 'rad'
@GarrettMassey my stomach would never betray me like that what do you mean?
I'm gonna eat this whole pizza and no one is gonna stop me
@runge_kelly yeah yeah I made some food XD
Realizing you haven't eaten anything all day and you woke up at 7:30 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ oops

@Jessidgy I hope you have a good time!!!
@vinegarcat omg
@PrinceCanary omg what do you mean bad jokes this is great
@TheAnglophiler LIKE, OF COURSE POINTING A SPORK AND A KNIFE AT AN OPPONENT MEANS YOU INTEND TO STEAL THEIR LOVER AWAY FROM THEM. OBVIOUSLY.

@Jessidgy oh my
@Jessidgy godyouresopretty *swoons*
@TheAnglophiler Their other incredible attempts included: deplation, depilation, and depliation I am amazed.
And they wrote 'depletion' four times in the same question and only got it right ONCE.
'Estrogogens' was on the actual final exam I am so mad
@SeaDicken good luck!!
@Jessidgy my entire college experience  summarized in 1 tweet. Incredible.
*snorts* strawbebbies. I am a child.
@vinegarcat we missed you, too!!! *giant hug*
@vinegarcat I will join you in the distance, we can gurgle and froth together
@vinegarcat omg
My roommate put an SAO picture at the end of her presentation out of spite for her project partners and no one changed it. She is ultimate.

@samiedraws DAMN. JUST. DAMN.
I only just got used to @Jessidgy 's OTHER cool rock icon, I can't handle this!
@samiedraws this June yeah *throws streamers*
@runge_kelly @Jessidgy you are my wee babs
My aesthetic in high school: hippie with weird hair colors, no idea how to do anything with the mop on my head, and no fashion sense. Nice.
@CanisLupusSif jfc
If I call you a nerd or a dork or some denomination thereof I probably think you're the cooliest person ever
Tfw two courteous people get stuck at an impasse because they keep trying to let the other go first
@samiedraws SAME
@samiedraws omg aww <FLUSHED FACE>
@samiedraws hoW ARE YOU SO PRETTY??? TEACH ME. *swoons*
@FoolishSpoon omg that would be awesome!!
No one should ever get attached to my characters, because they're probably going to die in the most heartbreaking way I can manage tbh
@TheAnglophiler @CanisLupusSif @savethetreees @GarrettMassey
This was honestly the best day my school's yik-yak ever had. Back when it was actually a thing 
Uhm 
@FoolishSpoon oh good *phew!* hope it heals up quick!!!
@FoolishSpoon oh no are you alright???
that end-of-the-year panic is starting to set in
@Jessidgy D: try drinking hot soup or something if you have it! I hope you feel better soon!!! :(
 commissions are now closed and will reopen mid-summer &lt;3 
@samiedraws oooh purple would be pretty
Strawbebbies is still my favorite internet thing, I'm already giggling jfc. STRAWBEBBIES.
Sometimes I sit down and listen to 'When She Loved Me," from Toy Story 2 on repeat, just to amp up the feels.
@Jessidgy they got sucked into the aether
@Jessidgy okay omg I got worried there, but that's okay! I am p much in a constant state of worry 100% of the time *shrug and hug*
@Jessidgy wait what????
@runge_kelly omg okay XD DM me your email
@Jessidgy I'll just awkwardly look at you all and, like, giggle at inopportune moments. BUt I'll be so happy, you just can't tell

@samiedraws sleep well, brother!!! -3-
@Jessidgy omg I love it, it's perfect
@iceyestJoey Yeah, I get you, it scared me, personally, but I know that not a lot of people feel the same, so yeah...
@iceyestJoey maybe, but I don't think that it makes the people less human, yknow? I know it's not a popular opinion, though *shrug*
I don't like the rest of it, but the face is pretty OK. this is a rough ideal of one of the Monsters from my story 
@iceyestJoey Ehh more the level of racism, honestly :/ I read parts of the book and the way he talked about Middle Eastern people scared me
@Jessidgy there has never been a truer tweet
@Jessidgy of course m'dear &lt;3 -3-
@Jessidgy I hope you get out of your rut soon!! &lt;3
Incredible 
@FoolishSpoon @RaposaBranca13 yeah I'm sure they'll get here soon!!! :(

@samiedraws That's what I said!!!
@TheAnglophiler OMG I spelled Majestic wrong jfc I need to sleep
It was supposed to be Thranduil's Elk from the LOTR franchise. It's my favorite creature in the franchise...;;; 
@samiedraws GOOD LUCK. IT'S GREAT. BUT TEARS.
@Jessidgy you go, girl
@Jessidgy okay I hope it works out okay and you feel better soon!!
@Jessidgy ??????? D:
Schmearing a fragile bagel with cold cream cheese is like watching your hopes and dreams fall apart right before your eyes
@Jessidgy I know, the nerve of some people having LOVE LIVES jeez
@PrinceCanary omg

@Jessidgy I think she might be with her gf?

@PrinceCanary omg SAME!
@SeaDicken oooh I feel you, well I hope your spirits get lifted up soon ^.^ have a great day if you can, okay?
@SeaDicken D: I'm sorry you're feeling that way!! I think your art is really spectacular!! It makes me happy when I see it ^.^
@Jessidgy but with enough time and care, you could become a gem *looks meaningfully into the sunset as some smooth jazz plays*
@PrinceCanary it's cause you're so gorgeous, doll-face <DANCER>
@CanisLupusSif omg
Why yes, of course! Slapping one's opponent across the left cheek with your palm is OBVIOUSLY a marriage proposal. Wth is this anime.
@CanisLupusSif good job so far
@CanisLupusSif I honestly feel like this is what people should be saying to me
My hair's so overgrown I look like a hoodlum
This is nice, I recommend it if you've got time! 
@fishyspacetuna Sweet dreams!!
@fishyspacetuna @samiedraws I agree with samie these are great!!!

Trystin is on level 111 on peggle, she needs to be stopped
@FoolishSpoon @Jessidgy I don't think I'll be able to make it I'm so mad I will DEFINITELY catch the next one!!!!!!
@CanisLupusSif jfc
I have a legit story idea that can be described as a social commentary, teen-espionage paro-dramedy. I'm a little worried.
@iceyestJoey you could say it...rocks
@savethetreees it's okay, you're always gorgeous -3-
@runge_kelly nice

It's Earth Day and my allergies are killing me. Oh rad.
@Jessidgy ....go on
Alternative titles for my story include The Thing, The Stuff, and my personal favorite The Giant Plot Device
tfw you don't really have a reason to, and you don't particularly WANT to, but you feel like having a good cry would make you feel better...
@vinegarcat drop dead gorgeous baby or....?

@RaposaBranca13 @vinegarcat Sounds like my kind of gal
sometimes I forget my roommate is here when I have my headphones in and I just start dancing around and then have to check if she saw ;;;
@vinegarcat same tbh
@vinegarcat good, Jaime will make her cookies while she steals all his food
Jaime's fridge: insulin, milk, apple slices, strawberry jelly, and everything you would need to make the best butterscotch cookies in town
@vinegarcat definitely 100% canon
@vinegarcat Zooey's fridge: juice boxes, bullets, a .38 magnum, light beer, leftover lasagna, half a pizza, and a bag of chopped cilantro
@vinegarcat sssssscandalous
@vinegarcat *whispers* he is definitely gonna touch the butt
@RaposaBranca13 @PrinceCanary hot damn

Why did the 1991 Soviet Coup fail, you ask? Because literally no one running had any idea what they were doing, basically.
@PrinceCanary anywhere, everywhere, ain't nobody got time to make a weed room :P

Omg this is from a misheard lyric video for Sugar We're Going Down I'm crying omg 
@Jessidgy <WORRIED FACE>
It's sad because the lore is my favorite part of my story, but most of it doesn't fit into the actual plot of the story + isn't necessary <WEARY FACE>
@samiedraws @vinegarcat SAME
@Jessidgy never, there's no way for us to leave even if we wanted to
do you ever just...have so much to do...that you just lay down and do nothing instead?
*sighs and groans at the ceiling* it's gonna be one of THOSE weeks

Dad's making brisket hella stoked

@samiedraws stay safe!!! Stand in doorways, I think maybe!! <HEART DECORATION>
@vinegarcat oh good I'm not alone ;;; they're so fun amirite
Is it wrong that some of my favorite scenes to write are death scenes? Bc they are...
You know this language is gonna be crazy difficult to learn when the introductory beginning class is 6 credits and 5 days a week
@FoolishSpoon @Jessidgy omg it's perfect
@RaposaBranca13 @FoolishSpoon aww no I hope you feel better soon!!
@vinegarcat honestly, you could conceivably live off of Soilent and flavor it with coffee, like, in the near future...
@vinegarcat @PrinceCanary omg aww
Trystin found where they take the psych and tech com majors to dispose of them at my engineering college probably 
@Jessidgy hugs across, like, four state borders?
I saw this and immediately thought of @FoolishSpoon 
@samiedraws @FoolishSpoon that's it, that's the whole show :P join us, brother
@FoolishSpoon @samiedraws it's more in a 'I have feels for a baby assassin and an insect rn I am questioning my life choices a little' way
I literally have a character make a pun and two jokes right before he dies. To his brother. True passion for the craft right here.
@FoolishSpoon @samiedraws it makes me sort of want to giggle and squeal, but also kind of want to get hit by a truck *shrug*
@FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat Also holds because why not amirite
Omg. Look how PROUD I was to put a shrink-cover on some wires I soldered omg I'm such a nerd jfc 
@vinegarcat :(
@PrinceCanary very true, but I was still not prepared
WH-WHAT?! NO ONE TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO CRY. WTH. T^T @PrinceCanary
@TheAnglophiler @Meredithicus
I've started realizing how much I talk about my best friend. Like, for serious, every other thing I say is about Meredith. Oops. ;;;
@PrinceCanary it's already great so far omg
About to watch The Brothers Bloom with my parents, I think @PrinceCanary would be proud
@FoolishSpoon I'm sorry D:
@FoolishSpoon omg
@FoolishSpoon no yeah it totally is. I just searched 'hinata getting hit with the volleyball' and uptown funk was the 4th result omg
@FoolishSpoon omg
Y'all should go listen to the gospel version of Jealous by Nick Jonas, it's really nice
@PrinceCanary D: *hugs* I'm sorry you're feeling like that
@vinegarcat I got a call from . before it was weird...
@vinegarcat THIS TREE DUDE THAT SAYS YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL LIKE OMG I'M LAUGHING SO HARD JFC
@vinegarcat I'm dYING XD
I'm watching the game grumps play Chulip and I'm crying what IS this game?! Omg @vinegarcat
@vinegarcat :(
@FoolishSpoon oh okay XD yeah numbness is weird...especially when it's only in select areas
@FoolishSpoon D:
@PrinceCanary my dad says you're a man with very good taste XD
@FoolishSpoon omg Fooli XD
@FoolishSpoon omg it's the apocalypse probably...just post a ton of 1D and maybe they'll go away
Just got a text from some random email with a bunch of letters asking to hook up this weekend... ;;; 
@PrinceCanary ????
@PrinceCanary no such thing <DANCER>
oh, god, there's only 2 weeks of school left someone hold me ;;;
Driving home! Hopefully streams are still gong if I survive the drive in the wind *grips the steering wheel*
@vinegarcat T^T if you're still going in like an hour and a half I will SO be there!!! *crosses fingers hella tight*
The only reason we know that the hippocampus processes memory is bc the firat and only hippocampectomy was performed on an epilepsy patient
@vinegarcat omg JB ;-; well I'm glad that you like it
@vinegarcat ooh yeah I can see how that could happen. Poor little cinnamon bun. Far too precious for this world
@TheAnglophiler god I just keep looking at this and ugh look at her LIPS. They make me want to SCREAM.
@vinegarcat oh no omg he's such a sweet little muffin is he okay??
When I say I need a haircut: 
Baby...baby no...nuclear...nu-clear...not nu-cu-lar...please...plEASE
YES!! My great aunt from Spain is probably gonna visit this summer!! The last time we saw her I was a fetus! Hella stoked!!
Man, I need a haircut, my sideburns are getting out of control
"We did everything right, now I'm on the outside." 

I hate it. 
wOW. I didn't think I'd ever have feels for a literal giant, sentient INSECT. BUT HeRE I aM! @FoolishSpoon
@PrinceCanary I'm totally okay with this
@iceyestJoey omg joey
@Jessidgy i mean...I already swoon every time I see your face...so...
I agree with @Jessidgy hair is awful, everyone should just have bald characters
Shakespeare was 46 when the KJV of the Bible was written; Psalms 46: 46th word from beginning is 'shake,' and 46th word from end is 'spear.'
Ending the night with a hella rough sketch of Ellie Goulding *sulks to bed* 
@GarrettMassey it would be better for me *huffs indignantly*
Why are real people so hard to draw? Like damn, why do 3D things have to be so detailed? *mega sigh*
@vinegarcat is this good wheezing or bad wheezing?
I keep an active eye on my twitter for hours and nothing happens, but I turn away to draw one Ellie Goulding and BAM it blows up, why this?
My aesthetic is being obnoxiously loud and dancing poorly when no one is home
@samiedraws @Jessidgy thank you, brother
@Jessidgy @samiedraws I'm so afraid, I just picked poison/ghost types because they're my fav and everyone is yelling ;;;
*Tina groaning* not sure how I feel about it ;;; 
@RaposaBranca13 :(
@Jessidgy *slides in late* mine would probably be Dragalge, Nidorina, Roselia, Haunter, Aegislash, and Mismagius ... ;;;
@elissajoscales nnnneERD
@FoolishSpoon haha thanks Fooli XD I'm taking a break to get pizza first (cough cough procrastinating cough cough)
Oh god oh god I'm so worried about lining this what if it sucks oh god ;;;
@Jessidgy 
Trystin always gets so mad at me because I don't have to pluck my eyebrows <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@FoolishSpoon yeah I'm alright, it was a group situation so it was easier to leave
@vinegarcat thanks, JB, I'm sitting in a different part of the building waiting for my roommate
Having to be in a situation with someone who makes you extremely uncomfortable and eventually just needing to leave the area to calm down
"Can I put my dead frog on your long board?" The things people say at my university #omg #shitmyfriendssay
New sketch of my lady from yesterday. Her names Zooey Magnus and she's a sniper (not sure how the pic turned out ;;;) 
@vinegarcat aah thanks so much!! ////
"Yeah yeah you're just my type" 
@PrinceCanary @Jessidgy the right thing
@Jessidgy @PrinceCanary omg thank you for this it is beautiful
Crush-update: it was great, he's super cute and his laugh is adorable. That is all.
@FoolishSpoon IT WAS GREAT!! HE'S SUPER CUTE AND WE WALKED AND TALKED AND UUUUUUGH
@FoolishSpoon Ah!! I missed the end of your stream!! :( Looks hella sick though
@samiedraws @FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat @Jessidgy *whispers* he's gonna touch the butt
@FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat tina *groans* Tina *groaning intensifies* TINA *Maximum groan activate*
Crush-update: he asked me to go for a walk around campus, not much but I'm still hella stoked!
What do you mean an ice cream sandwich isn't dinner? I just don't think you're trying hard enough.
@Jessidgy <FACE THROWING A KISS><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
*looks at the sky* oh, it's a rainy day *pulls out @Jessidgy 's kisses that I saved for just such an occasion*
"Oh, god, I just shot the sheriff" 
"But you didn't-"
"No, I definitely also shot the deputy"
*comes up with an entire plot based on a joke*
@vinegarcat @FoolishSpoon *grabs fooli's food that fell a little short and runs it over to Utah*
@PrinceCanary they wear ties now. Ties are cool. I think all your characters are super cool and look snazzy at the same time
Did some yoga and I actually feel pretty good this morning! Namaste, my lovelies, I hope you all have really great days!
@Jessidgy they have become too powerful
Yes, MS word, science fiction novels contain and abundance of 'undeletable' characters. Thanks for your contribution.
@samiedraws @Jessidgy ;^; why this, brother?
"Fight me" 
"Eh I'm not really in the mood" 
"Yeah me too"
"Thanks for the offer,though" 
"Yeah sure no problem" 
"<SQUARED COOL><SQUARED COOL>" 
Roommates, basically
@Jessidgy this was super sweet and then I got scared and now i'm conflicted
omg no it was 8:30 five minutes ago and I've barely started this paper lmfao
@Jessidgy I believe it
@Jessidgy @vinegarcat omg i'm crying this is beautiful XD
Bless whoever made this 
@runge_kelly omg I dunno there's a lot of gasping and snorting and other strange noises ngl
@samiedraws @fishyspacetuna anaesthesia not the best play on words but it's aight
@Jessidgy ;-; perfect
I have the ugliest laugh jfc ;-;
@Jessidgy well if it makes you feel better, my roommate agrees and approves of you
My roommates obsession with peggle is getting out of hand

episode 20: rhett runs out of hairgel. chaos ensues. 47 people are dead. 
I didn't know I needed drunk Brendon Urie telling the history of fall out boy until it happened, and my life is infinitely better for it
@vinegarcat @PrinceCanary *excited squealing*
It's okay to ask for help sometimes. It doesn't make you weak or less or some terrible burden. I think people need to hear that more often.
But look how cute my tiny pound cake is beside my equally tiny soda 
Trying to accomplish tasks without my glasses more like walking around with my arms out in the blurry abyss
@Jessidgy good plan, maybe soak them in nail polish remover? Go all MacGyver on them or something
Why do I always get sad and tired at 4 PM? Like is there a scientific reason or is it just me?
@Jessidgy oooh I've had those before you have to get them taken off at a salon right?
@Jessidgy your nails always look so nice I am jealous
*eats fruit pieces by skewering them with a chopstick because I'm too lazy to get up and grab a fork*
It's never a bad time for yoga pants
My roommate is SO pretty. She's also struggling to put skinny jeans on over tennis-shoes, bless her heart.
Looks like I'm gonna knee-d to ice this thing. Haha! Cause seriously ow why.
Will my headphones ever return from war? 
@vinegarcat :( *hug*
@FoolishSpoon ??? :(
What's that? You want me to write a paper about one of my favorite movies? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna write that paper SO HARD, just you wait

"Wow. Jealousy is a bad moustache on you."
Forgetting your headphones at home and becoming a sad potato
@CanisLupusSif we'll see, I haven't tried to stand yet...;;;
@CanisLupusSif jfc
@CanisLupusSif Andy, please
@samiedraws aah not sure, my knee is just acting up. It's like it needs to pop but it can't? I think it's better now, do not fear, brother
that's okay, knee, i don't need you to stand, you just go ahead and take a load off and throb a bit. thanks.
@Jessidgy D: ;;;
@runge_kelly jfc carter
@runge_kelly what time even is it where you are???
@runge_kelly omg carter go to bed
@FoolishSpoon aah thanks Fooli
I have such an intense fear of disappointing people, so I don't understand how I can manage to do it so often anyway
@runge_kelly <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@runge_kelly look at anatomy studies people do on tumblr or other websites! And practice!
The fact that really awful things happen to really good people makes me so angry I want to scream
@PrinceCanary oh no!!!! :(
@samiedraws @FoolishSpoon @Jessidgy @vinegarcat how can there be so much hate in a brother so small?
MIRRORS. FUCKING MIRRORS. USE YOUR GOD DAMN MIRRORS. THIS IS WHY I'M TERRIFIED OF DRIVING.
Aah I hate it when my mom gets all sad and sentimental when I leave, because now I just wanna stay and hang out all night :/
@PrinceCanary I feel this
@Jessidgy @samiedraws it's perfect
I really need to start doing yoga again, I'm starting to get all jittery
@FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat our king is returning *silent tears*
i wanted to draw steven too but my lightest copic ran out ;_; 
Just smacked my face on the cORNER OF THE DINING TABLE. OW. CRAP.
@Jessidgy @FoolishSpoon I honestly just wanna look at this fusion for hours it's so ncie
@RaposaBranca13 maybe, usually here it's because they think you're dieting if not that
@RaposaBranca13 that's fine though! I just hate it when wait staff look at me funny for ordering a salad since I'm already on the thin side.
sometimes I just wanna eat a salad, like, damn, what's wrong with salad???
@RaposaBranca13 @fishyspacetuna too hot! (hod damn)
@FoolishSpoon omg

Here's how mine and @PrinceCanary 's gems greet each other. Sparkles and everything. Cuties. 
Man, it's a good thing no one's home because I'm dancing around the house and it's honestly probably a little disgraceful...
@Jessidgy omg
@PrinceCanary @vinegarcat @RaposaBranca13 @Jessidgy @FoolishSpoon @samiedraws I added @fishyspacetuna but idk what your gem looks like ;-;
Idk this is how imagined the other gems would react the first time Hyper took off her hat after a battle or something

@Meredithicus 
@Meredithicus wow rude. I'm a thriving hub if pop culture and excitement. Is that no enough for you?
@Meredithicus T^T that's not enough time. Why you do this to me?
Waiting for summer so you can finally see your best friend again like: 
@PrinceCanary :(( I'm sorry I hope lots of good comes to you soon !!
Friendly reminder that just because you're dirty when you get into the shower doesn't mean it should be as dirty as you were when you leave
@vinegarcat omg shh no I'm hella adult or something ////;;;
The fact that my gem gets to stand next to @vinegarcat 's makes me a little stoked ngl...;;;@Jessidgy
@Jessidgy RAD OMG those are hilarious XD
@Jessidgy uuuh JB, me?, Branca, samie, Fooli, Rhett and then you? Did I get it?
@TheAnglophiler omg her hair got so sassy I don't know what happened...;;;
She communicates almost entirely through body language and judgmental eyebrow raising. 
@elissajoscales I hate you a lot
@FoolishSpoon @Jessidgy omg it's so good hhhhhhh

Fact of the Day: Pluto is still a planet in New Mexico because Clyde Tombaugh discovered it and was born here.
@Jessidgy no never *grabs and cuddles*
@Jessidgy omg thanks Jessi! ;;; I figured I should draw her whole face eventually... &lt;3
Proportions are a little weird and arms don't really do that but she's a gem. She's magic or something...;;;

I am trash. I almost wrote this whole paper in passive voice what the hell is wrong with me? *shame*

*listens to french music so words don't get mixed up while writing a paper* nothing could possibly go wrong
@FoolishSpoon that was probably it :P
Some Justin Bieber blog followed me for about 5 minutes and I just?????

Take that, case study!! You have been completed.
2nd case study, here I come. The answer is hypopituitarism. Eyyyyy.
Omg so much happened while in was asleep jfc

@Jessidgy <ANGUISHED FACE> oh no!! :((((( *hugs*
@FoolishSpoon oooh I'm sorry :((
@FoolishSpoon oh no!! :( *huggles* are you able to rest and relax at least?
NEVER trivialize or dismiss someone else's pain or anxiety. EVER.
Why am I suddenly remembering all the crappy stuff that was my fault from like 5 years ago, I don't need this shit right now
@vinegarcat aaah try your best to describe it maybe?? You can use onomatopoeias if you want? I'll do what I can XD ;;;
@vinegarcat i played trumpet for 9 years, I might be able to help?
@GarrettMassey oh good then :P
@GarrettMassey yeah...maybe I'll start posting about puppies and kittens to balance it out
WHY DOES MY PHONE THINK I'M IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE???
Do they like me or are they just friendly? My eternal , awkward struggle.
OK Mr. Douche-canoe. Your giant truck and trailer do NOT need to take up HALF OF THIS TINY PARKING LOT. JFC.

@TheAnglophiler mostly, I blame @vinegarcat , @PrinceCanary , @Jessidgy , @RaposaBranca13 , and @samiedraws why you do this to me??

Looking at old character lists and outlines like: 
Everyone should watch The Imitation Game. If not for the amazing story of Alan Turing, then for Benedict Cumberbatch's phenomenal acting.
*with renewed determination and zeal* "I AM GOING TO FINISH THIS BOOK IF IT'S THE LAST DAMN THING I DO."
@vinegarcat this wedding is gonna be so intense, holy crap
Protip: turning signals are a thing. So, you know. Use them, maybe.
Shout out to people who move to the side to stop and talk. You the real MVP.
6AM is a horrible time to be conscious

"Don't eat people 'cause you could get diseases and/or start digesting yourself!" Very simple. Cool cool.
And now I've learned the physiological issues that come with cannibalism #suchknowledge #radical
Learned a lot about human evolutionary theories today #alright #radical
You guys let me know when the letters get there, okay?? I just want to make sure they do ;;; @vinegarcat @FoolishSpoon
@Jessidgy I hope you're feeling better this morning! :( *hugs* <HEART DECORATION>
Scrolling through someone's actual tumblr instead of your dash and realizing like 20 reblogs in. Lol oops.
"Ugh why do you let me go out in public like this?" 
"GORGEOUS? I dunno." 
"That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me." @savethetreees
It must be so cool to have clear vision that you can't get finger smudges on...
@Meredithicus this is how I imagine our conversation will go when you get back to read all the trash I've written
"So, he shoots himself in the first chapter?"
"Yeah, but he's fine. I mean...he's not FINE, but he's alright" @Meredithicus
@fishyspacetuna omg my people XD that pun is glorious holy crap
@fishyspacetuna only the best
@PrinceCanary sounds like you're living the good life
Well, their dad died in the Crimean war, their mom couldn't care for them, and they both died before the age of 18. But they're fine now.
LETTERS HAVE BEEN SENT!!
It's pIZZA WEDNESDAY!! @savethetreees
@RaposaBranca13 omg XD
@RaposaBranca13 yeah they at least do that XD

Pulling a back muscle and not remembering how or when like a champ

Sometimes my character names have important meanings, just so I can hammer in the feels
@samiedraws @FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat @PrinceCanary that's gonna be one hella intense showdown
@FoolishSpoon @vinegarcat @Jessidgy you two, I sWEAR TO GOD. If I die young, I'll blame the two of you
A more apt title would be: "The Battle of Approximately 3-11 Armies, Depending on How You Look At It." But I suppose that is quite long...
An actual quote from my book. What am I doing with my life?

@RaposaBranca13 @PrinceCanary that, too
@RaposaBranca13 @PrinceCanary yes!! They should learn that when you ask for art for free you lose an arm, a leg, and your little brother

Current mood: 
@vinegarcat @PrinceCanary omg you two, this is just what I needed after today XD
