If you're a small business looking for insurance in Alberta, check this out!  
Good morning #Alberta! If you're upset with the new government, I suggest you get involved. #Voting is just a little piece of democracy...
@gordmccallum LOL - not at all. I don't bullshit just pointing out that you're potentially ostracizing a pretty large group of consumers...
Oh I get it now, you're trolling. LOL...not good for business @gordmccallum. Don't you want those new #Albertans to buy #insurance from you?
What? @gordmccallum
I am talking about people who supported the party for decades... what are you talking about? @gordmccallum
@gordmccallum Pretty dramatic statement considering many long-time @PC_Alberta supporters were also responsible for the @albertaNDP victory.
Follow @andrew_leach ...he's smart and knows important stuff about #energy #oil #politics... oh and #witty too, you won't regret following!
So many dramatic statuses about #Alberta being 'screwed' now...get real people...it's been a mess for a long time. #OptimismOverDespair #NDP
"Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world."
I suspect @JimPrentice and @PC_Alberta underestimated #Albertans who wanted change... #abvote 
@Monctonsnowman @MinRonaAmbrose @ElectionsAB ...to respect the privacy of the vote...
@Monctonsnowman @MinRonaAmbrose that's what I thought too! @ElectionsAB
FYI @ElectionsAB the #wheretovote part of your website sent us to the wrong polling location.
VOTED! #abvote #abelection #abpoli #albertavote #albertaelection
.@ReidFiest @GlobalCalgary @GlobalEdmonton I didn't think folks were permitted to take photos inside polling stations? @ElectionsAB
Should never have stumbled upon @Wentworth on @netflix .....

Anyone from #Calgary #Alberta heading to #smmw15? #socialmedia #marketing #socialselling
@iMEDIA_yeg where can you find the line up? Or is it just the two keynote speakers?

Thanks to the doc at #Rockyview who got this crazy "not being able to breathe" bs under control. Phew! Resting &amp; watching @netflix
He's not looking cranky here... @shanrayfair 
I love this man. Especially when he works all day &amp; then comes out to a parade he doesn't care about. 
Tonight we surprised @macfarlane37 with a trip to #Calgary to see the @NHLFlames play live... Thanks for helping us pull this off!!
Excellent float @MenInKilts eh @shanrayfair? #Airdrie #Christmas #parade 
Unless you're saving lives, there's really no reason to yell in any workplace I would think? 
I can't wait for the day when we no longer have debates like #GSA and everyone is just treated with respect &amp; supported how they need to be.
@sherrielebeau hahahahaha...I feel his pain! :)
@sherrielebeau we are just leaving!
Nothing like having a drunk asshole with a terrible weave job push your 3.5 yo around @NHLFlames ... 
Felix keeps yelling for #Nateman @Mackinnon9 ... This is going to be fun for everyone around us... @NHLFlames
@georgecanyon kicks off the @NHLFlames game... #NovaScotia represent! @Mackinnon9 
@NHLFlames he's been waiting a while for this... Thanks @expertbrokers for the tickets!! 
Okay.... Not all of Canada has four distinct seasons, especially #Alberta... @KalTire ;)
@TrumpetYYC excellent. Tweet your heart out.
Anyone else from #Calgary going to #SMMW15?
@MayArche @adamcrockatt unless it's a work party...
#ThrowbackThursday @HC_WJC @PerryCavanagh #IWasThere 
Hey you!! @MDK12345 How the hell are you?
@TrumpetYYC oh hello there!
@potentially_Fox thanks for the follow!
What do you think of @AirCanada and @WestJet #sadvertising? I think it's just dandy. 
opportunity_work.jpg 
@StefanOtsig @expertbrokers YES! So happy to be responsible - can't wait to see your entertaining #tweets sir!
"Focus on results, not clocking hours" was the message from @ScarletBLee &amp; @URNER1 ... love it and cant' wait to see…
@kfc sure hope there's a version of #doanythingforyou for the wives e.g.: putting up with your #mancold doing your stanky laundry etc.
Happy to see @targetshawnessy on #twitter. Seriously. You need to see our house. It's an ad for @Target &amp; @CrateandBarrel #lovedecor #yyc
Getting weird #emails from contacts @CBC @CBCCalgary has the server been #hacked?

@Andrea_Rac25 currently drinking coffee &amp; baileys. These are the days!
Worst commercial goes to @jiffylube ...
The corner of #AndersonRd and #Elbow is brutally icy folks! Take your time if you must drive in the @cityofcalgary today!
The roads are terrible in #Calgary ... Stay home if you can!
Would you pay NOT to see @Google ads? 
I firmly believe that @LinkedIn, while many things, is NOT a #dating site. 
#HappyFriday. Working from home. 
@Andrea_Rac25 and now it's back to work!
Thursday night. #Amazing 
@MarycMallon @stfxuniversity where do the @Olympics @MIT @StanleyCupRings all fit in? #goodmarketing
@sherrielebeau @SUBWAYCanada I say yes...
Possibly the best version of #AuldLangSyne by @BarraMacNeils 
The @BarraMacNeils kicked off an #EastCoast week at #ChateauOMac ... We're listening to @BruceGuthro #misshome 
Excellent start to the day @TricoCentre #bike #fitness #Calgary
After seeing the @BarraMacNeils last night, hearing the roar of an audience of Capers living in #Calgary, this could…
Wow! If you could just hear the crowd! @BarraMacNeils -- so proud! 
@LTniap @BarraMacNeils we're at the @yycARTS ... A full house of #Capers I'd say ...except two cranky #mainlanders! #CapeBreton2Calgary
And everyone is on their feet for the @BarraMacNeils ...except the two #mainlanders... Figures! 
#RudolphTheRedNoseReindeer ... Thank you @BarraMacNeils 
And then three...! @BarraMacNeils 
Then there were two... @BarraMacNeils 
It started with one.... @BarraMacNeils 
#OHolyNight by Lucy @BarraMacNeils #beautiful 
BIG shout out to @BruceGuthro from the @BarraMacNeils #CapeBreton2Calgary 
Love and joy come to you. @BarraMacNeils 
It pays to be loud at the @BarraMacNeils concert! We got better seats because we annoyed mainlanders. 
Some day you will be mine...... If the guy ever comes by so I can pay.... @BarraMacNeils #CapeBreton2Calgary 
We might be too loud for the @BarraMacNeils concert... #uhoh
Lots of whistling, clapping, happy #CapeBretoners.... None from Washabuck though.. :) 
You can't make them out but here are the @BarraMacNeils #CapeBreton #clapping #tapping and #yeehawing 
Patiently waiting for the @BarraMacNeils! #Christmas #CapeBreton2Calgary 
If you plan to use #SocialMedia in a regulated industry, have a read! 
You best brace yourselves @yycARTS ... #Capers in the house for @BarraMacNeils tonight. Can't wait! #ExiledCapeBretoner #Calgary
The slippers from @DeltaLodgeKan were a hit. What an awesome weekend. Thanks @expertbrokers and @DeltaLodgeKan #RKCP

Possibly the tiniest wine glass ever... @DeltaLodgeKan 
Personal opinion, but I think #AlexanderGrahamBell was pretty spot on. ;) #goals #plans #success  
Inspecting the #Christmas tree. Quality control is important.. 
@LTniap ohh when you have a 3.5 yo and you're out of town most weekends, you take advantage of "down time"!
We just finished decorating. Now we need to get the "kid" tree up. Love #Christmas 
Don't rest on your laurels. #insurance #business #digital #sales #socialmedia 
Is it the public driving the need to know these details? #media #calgary --&gt; 
We're looking for Christmas wreaths in Calgary - suggestions?
It's incredible how one person can make  such a meaningful impact on so many. Thank you Shannon.
What is the most frustrating thing about your #socialmedia program?
@Legallyblind19 what a night!
Fastest 8k...sub 6! Thanks to this kid. I love him more than he'll ever know. #LoveYouForever 
#SightNight run. #calgary

RSVP by... 
@CSParade strategic retreat... Giddy up! 
If you plan to visit #ChateauOMac this holiday season, plan to wear a paid of these bad boys compliments of @LUVBBW 
Tomorrow is the #SightNight run, who else is running? #calgary #runchat #subzero
Do you understand your #insurance policy? 
@ikhilioju @yami_2152003 @KimKardashian If you don't see the value in publicity amplifying causes, there's no argument I can make...
@yami_2152003 @KimKardashian excellent.
@ikhilioju @yami_2152003 @KimKardashian Did you hear ab the #ALSIceBucketChallenge? Having pros involved helped spread the word about ALS.
@ikhilioju @yami_2152003 @KimKardashian I thought I answered it ---&gt; yeah, publicity helps...
@dogmom27 @KimKardashian exactly....
@Koschmar @yami_2152003 so sad.
@ikhilioju @yami_2152003 @KimKardashian - having spent 25 years of my life volunteering for small non-profits, yeah, publicity helps...
@yami_2152003 but I appreciate your point of view. Have a happy Friday!
@yami_2152003 @KimKardashian I've never heard about her efforts. Maybe she should spend some time giving them publicity rather than herself?
For every #BreakTheInternet tweet, @KimKardashian should spend a dollar on a charity. She's so vain. When will she do something meaningful?
@Facebook and @LinkedIn serve two different purposes. Thanks for sharing, David ! 
The most important thing to remember is that your digital footprint will always be there, potentially haunting you! …
FYI: can't use a #giftcard to buy anything from the @Carters. Sad when we went to buy boots &amp; learned the site doesn't take Canadians GCs!
.@HomeDepot is not the next best thing to #NorthPole @Target @TargetCanada is. #hohoho
@brendaleemarie1 totally agree! To really honour them how about logging off completely &amp; venturing outside to a service...

CMA Awards SUPER BOWL Canadian Ad Challenge 
(2/2) disappointed that @CHANEL doesn't jump in... But hey... Guess I'll try going back to @BobbiBrown instead...
(1/2) Appreciate the social media rep from @murale @ShopprsDrugMart trying to help resolve an issue with a faulty @CHANEL product.
Can't say I'm surprised to see #CapeBreton on this list ;) #TopEmployer #Canada 
@LTniap well, we have room for you here. And lots of @JLohrWines in case you change your mind! :)
@Sarmacneil6 no.
There's no #ebola in #CapeBreton -- it was an attempt to prove that people don't critically read articles &amp; come to logical conclusions.
Great news story about how useful #socialmedia is --&gt; 
In other news, looking for a new place to buy @CHANEL in Calgary. Anyone?
@TravelAlberta just everything! ;)
After being told that @murale had a solution bc of @CHANEL product I bought with a bad hinge, I'm told there's nothing they can do. #fail
Dear #Woodbine drivers: Please SLOW DOWN. Thanks. #yyc #calgary #DriveSafely
I don't know how anyone could love the @TravelAlberta commercials more... so beautiful. #Alberta #vacation
@ArleneDickinson @WBrettWilson People need to think &amp; act all-year-round. What do you do to honour our @CanadianForces members &amp; vets?
We'll miss Vern Kimball! But definitely a well-deserved retirement. :) @calgarystampede

Awe @stephaniediec you are the best! Love the water bottle :) thank you! 
What do you think about #privacy &amp; #socialmedia in #Canada? Should companies have the right to sell your information if you use their site?
@being_meghan I will check that out! Thanks!!
Does anyone know where I can find a somewhat easy #knitting #pattern for #slippers? 
#SocialMedia #privacy 
Weekends spent with good friends &amp; family is the best. Now snuggles with the most important boy in my world &amp; then bed. #SundayFunday
@murale a friendly reminder that my @CHANEL compact is still broken and I've DM'd but no one has responded...

.@blueferguson @Rosie that's a start. Everyone's angry, but name calling reminds me of @realDonaldTrump &amp; takes away from the real issue.
"A nations culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people." #IAmCanadian
@blueferguson @Rosie name calling is so juvenile. Get real. If you want to be pissed at her show some intellectual capacity.
@Rosie @sweetashoneyedm Our talk shows have real journalists, who are worldly &amp; do research required to participate in informed commentary.
@Rosie @blueferguson wow! Did she say something insensitive? Yes. But don't belittle to that degree...it makes you no better...

@driciafury @theviewtv @Rosie 1 life or 86, these are irreplaceable ppl. It's shaken Canadians to the core bc it doesn't happen daily.
@theviewtv @chrissyteigen and a guy jumps the fence at the whitehouse and it makes international headlines.... #hypocrites

Make your press release pitches about people. Put a human twist on it. You've gotta do more legwork to help journalists out. #cnwbwtm #PR

Key to good relationship between PR professionals &amp; journalists: work with people who won't "screw you over." Best advice by @crudereporter

@Bell_Support @Bell we just got another bill in the mail reminding us of the amount owed to us... When can we charge late fees?
Is your #business ready for #CASL? #YYC #Business #marketing 
@Bell why don't pay back balances? We overpaid on closing bill but still haven't been reimbursed. Isn't that like stealing @rcmpgrcpolice?
"Take these wings and learn to fly" -- sending all our love to #Moncton.. @rcmpgrcpolice @RCMPNB

Heading out to celebrate nuptials of good friends! XOXOXO

We legit pushed/lifted a car out of the ditch during the #CabotTrailRelay (after running &amp; dancing/screaming/supporting runners 12 hours!
@kyletosh5 so leg #4 then?
@ourbaddeck YES! Huge thank you to them, the volunteers &amp; organizers. Best race in the world! #cabottrailrelay
@AirCanada I am impressed with multiple languages spoken by attendants though... That kind of makes up for delay....
@AirCanada it would be handy to have people at the gate let us know that things are running behind.... #chaos
@MLimaBean @AirCanada they don't communicate! Irritating.
Now I remember why I haven't flown @AirCanada in 12 years....
@kyletosh5 so... You in next year? #CabotTrailRelay #albertaenergized
@AtlanticChip thanks for everything! We tried REAL hard to follow the rules! #AlbertaEnergized #cabottrailrelay

I guess we will hit up @RunningRoom today for some last minute #cabottrailrelay goodies #AlbertaEnergized
#CASL is going to force companies (large and small) to adjust how they go to business online. Learn how. 
When I read the headline, I thought it may have been about email etiquette. Nothing grinds me more than when people …

@calstampeders think about coming down on him like the @NBA did on Sterling... Words have repercussions. #shameful &amp; #embarrassing
@JulieJcv @JusticeWillett I miss those days sometimes! :)

@AskSubaruCanada @SubaruCalgary haven't had the chance.. Is this normal? Have others had this issue with their vehicles?
@JBarrrg Definitely not surprised. She's the boss.
@JBarrrg Does she listen? He is a mix... we haven't done DNA tests, but it looks like Shepherd/Rottie mix? But #ARF wouldn't say either way.
@Subaru_Canada @SubaruCalgary Both key fobs are not working for my 2014 Outback. Is this a known problem? Super pain in the ass.
Happy Mothers Day to all those moms out there &amp; dads who do the job of both!
CRM: Customers really matter 
@JBarrrg as you should be! My concern is when he's 85lbs...but they're a lot of fun, hey? Is she a pug? #puglife
Dislocated shoulder ain't gonna keep me from running the #CabotTrailRelay .... Can't wait!! #AlbertaEnergized #MacKenzie

Sigh... I just got people excited about the potential of this app... #CardMunch 
@PlanCanada work day and not allow a break in the conversation so I can say "can you please call back at another time?" (2/2)
@PlanCanada: our family has supported through various initiatives. It's a little shocking to have someone phone in the middle of the 1/2
@PlanCanada has probably the most aggressive sales team ever. Almost five minutes of straight pitching without stopping to take a breath.
Morning walk with #SirBentleyNoodle ...those are mountains... Awesome. 
Very cool to see a local firm put #Calgary on the tech map... watch out #SiliconValley 
@LTniap Two cuties!!!! Thank you :) It's amazing how fast they just fit in, hey?

@VinceFowler @WalmartCanada @TargetCanada I can't even imagine. I was a server for 10 years going through school/university, I don't get it.
Super interesting blog about influencing the "affluents" through #socialmedia 

We had an awesome session today with @stephaniediec. Love, love, love LinkedIn! 
@XChecKCanceR @metrocalgary have you tried contacting @Metro_Nolais? Great cause, certainly worthy of some press :)
@VinceFowler Oh so true! People need to start thinking of @LinkedIn as the "hub" of who they are professionally...

What Social Data Can Tell You (And Why) 
@calgarytransit we just got to Southland LRT and driver announced that the earlier bus didn't come because of an accident...?
@calgarytransit #56... It was super early because there are few of us commuters who usually grab it at the same time on the later one..
I love using @calgarytransit but man it's a pain when busses show up to a stop way early &amp; you have to wait for the next one! #commuterprobs
We aren't sure what the right answer is -- what do you think? 
Great news from LinkedIn #socialmedia #branding 
The big problem in #YYC is that rental vacancy rate now close to 0 and the average rent is $1224 - 154% increase over 10 years.
