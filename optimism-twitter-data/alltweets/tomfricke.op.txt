Looking forward to basking in the sun today thru the weekend in @summitcounty ... perhaps some skiing will be in order.
New car battery time, now being installed... plus, I have new jumper cables. Bring on the sub-zero temps!
After a few sub-zero nites, my guess is Lake Dillon is officially frozen over. Maybe @DillonMarina knows for certain.
14 degrees below zero; current temp &amp; the temp where my car will not start. 10 below was fine, but 14 below was the tipping point.
Can we all now get back to normal? #holidaysaredone

@ClassicRockFM the rain &amp; cool feeling good after the dry Utah desert w/100 temps for a few days. Hoping for fire danger to be reduced.
Meanwhile, the Colorado mountains finally enjoying some good moisture from the monsoon flow...and cool temps only in the 50s today!
Hard to describe the absolute most fun river trip to date on Westwater. Big rapids! 
Back from Utah desert sun &amp; heat, into Colorado mountain rain &amp; chilly temps.
What an amazing raft trip on Westwater!
Westbound &amp; down, destination Westwater, UT for some boating on the Colorado. Pausing in Glenwood, waiting for the TL to catch up.
Happy #4thofJuly ! Heading to Westwater Canyon on the Colorado River for some boating over the next couple days.
Thunderstorms in the forecast for the Colorado mountains for the next few days... here we go, #monsoon

“@bobandtom: We're still looking for new show slogans.  Send us your best… #slogans” how about: "we don't suck."
Short week. Off to raft Westwater on the 4th. I've heard there's still some swiftly moving water.

EWWWW!!GROSS!!@Madonna Bares a Nipple on Stage in Istanbul

My weekend at the Crazy Dog Ranch: 
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
so, now it's socially acceptable for writing online dollar amounts to place the '$' sign at the END of a number, not the beginning? WTF?
uh oh, I may be having rafting withdrawal since I didn't get on the river over the weekend. Ready for much boating during/after #FibArk!
was 'exposed' to a new, uh, "song" by Ma-DRONE-ah yesterday &amp; was pretty much disgusted. People expected to buy this shit?
Crazy Dog Ranch visit this weekend was a nice break &amp; not too crazy, dog.
Like the idea of a full moon float on the Upper Colorado River tonight, but really don't like the idea of no sleep tonight. What to do?
RIP Facebook. The pleasure was mostly yours, partially mine.
Confirmed: whitewater rafting trips on Westwater &amp; Gates Of Lodore coming this season + Upper C &amp; Ark usuals. Diggin' my new boat!

FYI radio &amp; other media idiots; her name is Summer.
NOT Summers. 
Please give her the courtesy of saying her name right.
Was good to know you, #Facebook. After today, I'm pretty sure you'll start to really suck. Even worse than you have been.
nice to be home after a couple nights rolling around in the Utah desert red dirt.
LOTS of people in Moab this weekend enjoying the sunshine &amp; recreation. They're in my way.
remember the scene "Cowboys&amp;Aliens" when gold coins melted to the ceiling? Black Keys "Gold On The Ceiling" should be the new soundtrack.
river rafting the Colorado or mtn biking in Moab? decisions to be made before the weekend! always open for lewd suggestions...
I just biked 16.83 mi in 1:36:01 with a 05:42 min/mile pace using @MapMyRide. Check out my route! 
Bike ride today, getting ready for Moab this weekend. Unlike last year when my 1st ride of the season was slickrock trail. Brutalized.
Avengers in 3D; gotta do it tonight. I'm such a geek, get over it.

Ski racing done for me... For this season , anyway
My final Keystone Night League Ski Race is tonight, we'll probably be done before sunset, even with a couple hikes. Then cocktails.
1st time in years last night, wanted aspirin for a backache. Expiration on bottle was 7/08. Wow, LONG time since I've needed aspirin!!
Tebow time for the Jets...

my mind is fixated on river rafting and the desire to go boating... a couple months too early??
the legendary Back Bowls were once again my domain today

Contrary to popular belief, I did NOT supply meth to former sheriff Pat Sullivan. Don't know how the media got my name in this whole mess..
This is the time of year I'm so thankful to be single & don't even have the THINK about the "alleged" holiday tomorrow.
Me Likey!  
someday, will get over a thousand of .. something. tweets, following or followers? which will hit 1k first? tweets in the lead............

Favorite photo of the day:  
one foot, two foot... how much snow you got? It's dust-on-crust in Summit County.
Glad to hear *someone* is playing in the snow. Sure as hell ain't us in the mountains, that's for sure. Have fun Denver!
just wondering why people refer to Groundhog Day as Ground Hogs day. Gives me images of pushing pigs into the shredder. ..mmmmm sausage...
hope you enjoy the snow on the front range. line-up the dump trucks on the streets, when they fill, bring 'em up to the ski slopes.
a fine couple days in Denver at #SIAshow, traveling to Winter Park tomorrow, looking forward to on-snow demos & fun w/friends!
@tomfricke sux dude
yes, there is now snow in the Colorado mountains... and I can't see a damn thing with broken windshield wipers.
arrrrgh!
got a sample in my media bag for the USA Pro Cycling Challenge... enjoyed it! 
 (@YouTube 
snow's crankin' and my windshield wipers are not wiping. SHITFUCKSHITFUCK! I can't see to get to the powder on the slopes!!!
ski days this week; sun, mon, tue, wed, thur,... and then my windshield wipers crap out. was on a roll, eh?
No Oscar nom for Tilda... nor for Ampersand, Apostrophy or Semi-colon. I heard Comma just missed the cut.
oh crap. busted by x-wife#1 on a FB post, rehashing bad memories from the 70s. thought statute of limitations ran out by now.
Ski lift lines can absolutely ruin an otherwise good powder day. Too many people, not enuf terrain open yet, too much aggression.
X-C skiing today in the backcountry; Mayflower Gulch. 
Fat skis ready for tomorrow's powder, wherever it may fall...I'm targeting Vail.
@tomfricke #tecnicablizzard 
Bodacious kinda weekend!
really? a foot of snow tomorrow night? 
Sunday should be a #BlizzardBodacious kinda day
A fine PM session at @KeystoneMtn today on some SOFT snow ! More pow on the way this weekend, fer sherrr
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
Powder day & I'm working... So get some for me, okay?
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
meanwhile, looking forward to sleeping in past 6am, then some blueberry pancakes & Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage on the griddle & ski racing.
what's up w/follow requests from people who have thousands of follower/ees... and yet they have single digit tweets. Spammers? Scammers?
Thank you, weekend. You got here just in time.

@tomfricke @beavercreekmtn Thank you. glad to see the post before I went to bed. It was a great morning with my first powder day.

I was wrong, wrong, wrong about the #broncos. I am officially amazed at what they can do.
most enjoyable debut of my Blizzard Bodacious skis today at Beaver Creek on the first powder day of the season.
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
Dreaming tonight; FIRST CHAIR at #Vail, Sunday morn, a foot of freshies, and the debut of the Bodacious from Blizzard.

How bad will the #steelers destroy the #Broncos on Sunday? Bad. Real bad. So bad I won't watch!
got the feeling #Broncos players wished yesterday's game was the end of the season & wouldn't have to be humiliated again. One more time!
Remember your sunscream this week when you hit the slopes!
please, #Steelers be merciful as you put an end to this dreadful #Broncos season next week. thank you. No saviors invited.
Hippy Gnu Ear.
At least those 126 MPH wind gusts have diminished here in the Colorado mountains. Still waiting on the snow. And waiting. waiting... waiting
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
thanks to #Monarch ski area for the all-natural snow! Quite refreshing after skiing hard pack/icy machine-made snow the past few months.
now that's FOUR times this morning the newsguy said "ELMIS Dumerville." This is a NEWSGUY. Credible? He also says Noo-cyoo-leer. Idiot.
not once, not twice, but three times this morning, the newsguy says "ELMIS Dumerville." Really? "ELMIS??"

@USAProChallenge thank you for planning my vacation dates for next year...Awesome route! All in my backyard. Great to live in Colorado!
The danger of early season skiing. Would not have been there, but had to work. Can I file for workmen's comp if I die?
It was inevitable; today while skiing, blindsided from behind by an out-of-control snowboarder. Knocked me out of my skis. I will survive.
just waiting for the arctic cold to move out, then I'll go ski. not a frostbite fan.
will again say, this is the first season I've been excited about the #Broncos since the Elway era. Could feel it then, feeling it again.

Entertaining the notion of skiing a few runs today A-Basin
Custom ski boot fit @podium sports, getting the me Tecnica demons dialed in
nice, gently falling snowflakes... where's all that wind? Not missing the wind, just wondering where it went.
looking forward to snow by morning... maybe sooner. something's blowing in, but that wind has been howling for a few days now...
I uploaded a @YouTube video 
anyone interested in concert news re: Phil Lesh, Warren Haynes, Jackie Greene and other of his "Friends" coming to Denver?

Skied a run today with Picabo Street at @coppermtm
always amazed at the stuff floating around here in cyberspace; just came across a picture I shot in 1991 posted on someone's FB page.
Thanks @packers, I can now rest assured you'll wrap this one with no problems and I can now go to bed. Sleep well.
will watch Packers/Vikings game up to halftime... when it should be obvious who'll win.
The debate rages; was this the Full "Hunter's Moon" or "Beaver Moon" this past week? 
Not as much snow as we wanted. You may not understand is that we WANT huge piles of snow to dump here. What we call 'White Gold'
Winter Storm Warnings, Blizzard Warnings, another iPhone OS update... what could possibly go wrong?
windy & ominous this morning in the Colorado mountains, now awaiting the blizzard.
Getting new tires just in time for the major winter storm coming to the mtns this weekend, gotta get to the slopes w/o sliding into a ditch

wow, glad to have opted for watching; both #Broncos & #Packers win, it's gonna be a great week!
may spend the day playing outside instead of wasting my time with #Broncos football today, disaster ahead for #Broncos, lost confidence.
Will be shoveling snow tomorrow before football fun and after an indulgent breakfast...Mimosas are a strong possibility. And so is a nap.
goo balls. that is all. goodnight.
Widespread Panic is tearing it up in Chicago! Tearing; as ripping it up. Not  the emotional tears/crying kind of tearing up. Not yet anyway.
Love it! Chillin' in the sun before the storm. 
Widespread Panic playing BOC "Godzilla" to start their 2nd set.. into "Iron Man" ... more scary tunes to come!
Just saw a bunch of dudes dressed as firemen rushing by. Pretty cool. They had the truck and everything.                 (tx drew)
hung a "FOR SALE" sign around my neck.... I'm Congress!!
I found more about ghosts, ghouls, goblins, etc on Wikedpedia ...
bring on the snow; a couple storms coming to the mtns this week
at home by the fireplace after an enjoyable weekend.
A hot dog with nothing in the middle? A hollow-weenie.
Another fine sunny day in Summit County, Colorado... 
“@FredWinston: @tomfricke  May I suggest a rustic saloon.  I'm sure there are a couple out there in snow country.” 
@FredWinston Rustic Saloon it is! Pug Ryan's in downtown Dillon will be a good place to start the #orange sunday festivities.
One problem with NOT owning a TV; I have to find a place to go watch the Tebow-mania this afternoon.
Winter arrived today - here's looking outside my front door 
Beginning to look more like winter here in the Colorado mountains this afternoon. Tomorrow should be fun!
@sisty_ugler @petalandbean : check

Awesome afternoon skiing on the white ribbon of death/fun at A-Basin, despite the fact there was no skool today in #sumco
maybe some afternoon laps at @Arapahoe_Basin tomorrow?... contact me if you're in. see you on the radio in the morning!
Still some fall colors in the Colorado High Country...the wind has been blowing leaves off trees all weekend. 
can't see the forest thru the trees. 
Why I love photography: wild animals will randomly charge you while you're holding a camera: 
When the Twitterverse gets a hold of this... they'll want a truck just like this. 
Broadcasting LIVE tomorrow from Noon-2PM at Pioneer Sports in Frisco, lots of freebies, Hart ski pro on site, ski giveaways, etc etc. See ya
Love it! In case you didn't pay attention, A-Basin is open for the season. Pic from yesterday morning, pre-opening 
sometimes, as cool as it is, to live where I live, I want to be a thousand miles away. just to be somewhere else. then I want to come home.
Got my 1st runs after another successful opening day broadcast at @Arapahoe_Basin, 9th consecutive year of opening day radio at the Basin.
Favorite photo of the day:  
Cracker in Vail 
#iOS5 installed just fine, all is good in Apple-update-land. Now to play with the new features... kinda like getting a new iPhone!
@Arapahoe_Basin looking good for tomorrow's ski season kick-off!
#iOS5 now loading on phone, hoping it won't explode... no smoke emissions as of this writing.
My iPhone 4 is now getting updated with the new software... how exciting! Like getting a new phone for free with all the cool new stuff.
vacation's over, I'll be at @Arapahoe_Basin tomorrow morning broadcasting live at 6am from the 6th Alley for OPENING DAY! Ski day number one
one more thought about online dating; even if she's ugly, it still gives me a nice feeling that she checked my profile.
Boreas Pass above Breckenridge yesterday... 
one more thought about online dating: Not that I'm a real winner, but the 'matches' for me were far from matches. Even after many drinks.
a few highlights from my drive above Breckenridge over Boreas Pass yesterday: 
snowy roads on the drive over Boreas Pass today. Posting pics tomorrow on 

enjoying my stay-cation vacation in a place where others only dream of - my home. Colorado, baby.

Over 1,000 beers to sample at GABF... I may only get to a hundred or so.
Great American Beer Fest in Denver; haven't hit this party in almost 2 decades...about to revisit now & drink tasty adult beverages.
What a gorgeous weekend!
At this point, just making dinner is going to be #prettydamnambitious
Thinking of climbing a mountain this weekend...there's a few in my backyard & weather is cooperating nicely. #prettydamnambitious
My luck must change for the better as I attempt to Win a pack of six #photography field guides from @BHPhotoVideo and @focalpress #bhfocal
I hope so too! Wendy's hopes it has built a better burger 
Car in shop again, brakes failed...again
Just about every ski area in Colorado got snow based on all the posts of snowy peaks on the web today. Skiing in less than 30 days?!?!
May have to venture out this evening...Pug's will be a good place to start!
With snow expected tonite, time to cuddle up by the fireplace w/a good book. Or someone who's just read one.
#wxreport says we may get 3 to 6 inches of snow tomorrow night over higher elevations. Ski season less than a month away!
Hope you could reflect on this day and seek a deep-down understanding of what this day means to so many who suffered losses. Remember.
SNOW on the high mountain peaks of Colorado! Who's ready for ski season? #wxreport
It's not easy for women to meet my very high standards after many trials and tribulations... and a couple divorces. That's #whyImSingle
snow on the Colorado mtn peaks must mean we're darn near ski season!
Why I love photography: the colorful array of plants with medicinal benefits. 
Anyone remember the legendary Paonia Purple Paralyzer?
Well, this isn't it. This is BETTER. 
Next week will still feel like summer in Grand Junction for the big #BBQ:

Next week at this time, the smokers will begin to arrive for the Pork & Hops Challenge in Grand Junction...and I'll be there ready for #BBQ
I liked a @YouTube video 
A cold front is headed to Colorado this Friday. Crap. Summer's over. Snow shovels on standby.
A fine evening in Vail for Cracker & a free show, hardly anyone here! David & Johnny getting set to rock this house & I'm front & center.
after hellacious rain in @Breckenridge_WX ... now clearing for a nice overnight high country chill #wxreport
pre-season football is like being horny but unable to climax. something about it is just so... unsatisfying.
@BroncoTalk LET'S GO
Looking at the ski slopes of Breckenridge today, as they're green and void of whiteness. Thoughts turned to powder skiing. 90 days or less!
so much fun today at the #usaprochallenge in Breckenridge, but my feet are hurtin' from all the running around. Mucho Excellento.
#USAProChallenge coming to Breck today, got my press credential, armed with camera, standing by at the finish !
Party continues with Carbon Leaf in concert outdoors on Main St in Frisco in an hour, not seeing any rain on the horizon. Very good.
Steamboat was a nice warm-up for the really big show in Breckenridge tomorrow for the #USAProCyclingChallenge! Ready to party?!?!
Biking up Vail Pass to the finish of the #USAProChallenge today. Anyone else in for the ride?
you'll see a HUGE difference in the crowds; compare uppity #Aspen vs. rockin' #Breckenridge during USA ProCyclingChallenge. Sat will ROCK!
anything wrong with that @gratzo ? In a land called #Aspen, where all 45yr old women look a fake 38 and drive range rovers.
I kinda dig it.
now I can say my new iPhone & iMac are the "last of the Jobs generation."
...and hope they're not antiques before the year is out.
George!!!!!!!!!!
Watching for @lancearmstrong in Aspen for the finish of today's #USAProChallenge .. just look for the big crowd.
I usually NEVER watch bicycle racing... But now, absolutely cannot get enuf of the #USAProChallenge !!
Watch for the massive party on top of Independence Pass during the #USAProChallenge. A buddy took his Doctor & a keg...
Peloton closing on leaders..this is gonna be an amazing finish in Aspen today!
#usaprocycling anncrs clueless about CO roads, saying they're climbing Indy Pass now .. NOT. Still on Hwy 24!
was wondering when you were getting here @lancearmstrong for the #USAProCyclingChallenge .. Levi certainly rocked it today at the 'Butte!
Crested Butte looking great for the bikers, ready to climb!!!
Beautiful day for sailing Lake Dillon, great company with my daughter on board!
when they yell & shoot their guns into the air in the Middle East, do people ever get hit by the falling bullets?
YMSB last night at Red Rocks; awesome! Ma Nature provided a light show for another surreal evening on the rocks.
Why do people hate Raider football fans? Start here: 
Must be to celebrate the birthday of Gene Roddenberry.
Or Fat Joe.
Rappers'n sci-fi shit.
Why are fireworks going off in Wildernest tonight? Loving it !! for whatever the occasion!
Digital photo manipulation is wonderful. 
But when you were there, it really looked like this!

Just have to share this: high alpine wildflowers on Shrine Pass yesterday. 
Anyone remember when this ghost town was thriving?  
Sitting at the bar at Pug's much nicer than sitting in traffic on I-70...plus, the drunks aren't as dangerous here. Well, not much.

Happy Fathers Day to all us dads! Morning Thunder tea, some breakfast, then skiing for me. A- Basin turning the lifts thru 4th of July!
@RickysRidge shoulda been in Frisco today for BBQ challenge!
It is with overwhelming sadness that we inform our friends Clarence Clemons passed away. The cause was complications from his stroke.
Pretty full of meats after the @Frisco BBQ ... Dads day skiing tomorrow at @Arapahoe_Basin ?
At least the rain in Frisco makes it a lot easier finding a parking place for the BBQ!
#BBQ this weekend in Frisco kicks off tonight then hits full stride tomorrow night when I plan on non-sobriety
Overnighter this weekend whitewater #rafting, camping with good friends, fellow River Rats!

Morning from the Colorado mountains where the sun is hazy from wildfires, no bluebird skies today.
Whitewater rafting anyone?
I now know the tolerance level of the smoke detectors in my new apartment. And made a damn good pizza in the process.
whitewater #rafting now huge & only beginning on #colorado rivers..about to get gnarly w/massive snowmelt in the next few weeks, use caution
Whitewater rafting yesterday most awesome on the Blue ....hitting Upper Colorado River today w/huge flows!

Denver feels HOT compared to Summit!
Going to drive down the hill to Denver to get some sun & warmth today.
Endless winter continues. On the bright side, I'd rather be dealing with snowflakes than mosquitoes.
Hey! Guess what?! It's snowing. Again. Never-ending winter continues in the mtns.
#endlesswinter continues thru next week, maybe sun by next Friday? It's gonna be a long week.
More snow as we continue our #endlesswinter in Summit County, Colorado
No comment needed for this photo:  
Moving sux, Pugs will remedy the situation
Back on the #radio in the a.m.  See ya then
Fun in the sun on the slopes today with Those Austrian Guys @abasin
Looking forward to skiing & whitewater rafting the same day soon.
The good news: we could have a 4th of July ski day at A-Basin! And they told me that would never happen again...
Snow in the forecast again today & tonite. Endless winter continues in the Colorado mountains.
Despite todays sun, still thinking of heading west to Moab or at least Fruita tomorrow. Over skiing, wanting more biking this year.
Might as well go ski since it just keeps snowing
A foot of snow here in the mtns expected today, skiing still great at A-Basin!
more snow for the mtns: in the Sawatch, there could be 12 inches or more of snow by noon on Wednesday
Diggin' the sunshine very much the past few days

Broadcasting a hi skool football game tomorrow night... haven't done sports announcing since the early 80s... should be interesting!
Good morning from 9500' above sea level in the Colorado mountains, where smokey skies are prevalent... onward thru the haze.

summer is over.  School's in session, cooler temps and talk about new ski gear.  Now all we do is wait for the snow!
Great to hang with Lindsey Vonn in Vail yesterday.  Not only one of the best ski racers in the world, but a nice person!  ... and she's HOT!
Just pretty damned happy about the weekend being here..........

Highlight of yesterday's Rockies game; a hawk sweeps up a small bird off the grass in center field, crowd gasps at a wildlife moment!
Gonna catch my first Colorado Rockies game at Coors Field in several years... Sunday!
weather for sailing Lake Dillon has been preventing me from doing daily chores... too bad, eh?
Looking forward to a mellow mountain week, doing some fly fishing on high alpine lakes in search of native cuttys.

Another big week in Summit County; fireworks on the 3rd & 4th of July!  I've always been a pyrotechnic freak and LOVE the booms...
Where to NOT dine in Frisco, CO:  Bagali's.  The absolute WORST customer service EVER!  the owner is a real prick, too.
Satellite radio = Crap you have to PAY FOR!
"Rosie O'Donnell Lands Talk Show On Sirius XM" Just what we need, a militant lesbian whack-job with her own show. After she bombed on TV?
A great way to start another great day:  
cars with license plates from Hawaii and Bermuda... in the Colorado mountains?  what the hell are they doing here? how'd they get here?
where can I get a reasonably priced front shock installed for my mtn bike?
can't believe we're only a couple weeks away from the 4th of July holiday...

skipped breakfast ... contemplating lunch... may just have to settle for a nice early dinner.  My eating habits suck!
is wondering where the sun will shine this weekend, besides south FLA.  Tired of seeing Colorado clouds!
finding fishing a lot like dating;  "Catch & release"
was catching lots of rainbow trout on the Blue River yesterday in spite of big flows... all that water chased 'em outta their hidey holes!

shouldn't dating be FUN?   then why is it becoming such a pain in the ass?

the cure for embarrassing itching is usually embarrassing scratching.

1st time bbq this season was a bust!  Charcoal wouldn't get to max heat, had to finish the steaks on the stovetop!
gonna wear shorts for the first time this year while checking the flows on the lower Platte river!
remembering getting free swine flu vaccinations back in 1976...  is that still good?
now, it's just a matter of weeks before we get to play on the snowmelt... Whitewater Rafting season is coming soon!
