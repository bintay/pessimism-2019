@khalidhamdi @YourFaceIs7aram Khalid, did you just discover cameras?
@goal_intl @A_SK7 you scared me for a min.
@khalidhamdi @YourFaceIs7aram I think its "can't bother..etc"  Khalid, be hip.
@DAALLOOOO I've had back and knee problems for years too, laziness doesn't help.
@YourFaceIs7aram @khalidhamdi Khalid you're so creepy. Banziftnan I'm not light skinned, neither body or soul.
@YourFaceIs7aram @khalidhamdi laziness man, I just atshahad whenever I want to sleep and can't breathe properly.
@YourFaceIs7aram @khalidhamdi nope, I've had it for more than a month, but it only stops me from breathing properly after playing football.
@khalidhamdi nah its not like stab pains, its harsh.
Chest feels like someone opened it and scattered dirt on my lungs, thanks.

@latifa_elhakim @LinaElsiddig Lina got beat 3-0, she can't afford anymore damage..
@latifa_elhakim <UNAMUSED FACE>
@latifa_elhakim promises were made to be broken.
Plus how did you even remember I mentioned you first if it isn't a big deal to you? I don't remember it at all..
"I still remember when you mentioned me first" o.O

@ClassicFemale9 6?
@ClassicFemale9 I hope it is, but looks like I'm right.
Just a matter of time before Madrid equalize tbh, they're playing better.
Ronaldo wasn't even happy cause he didn't score it. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
No..
They should've played with this line up from the start.
@ClassicFemale9 what's funny?
@A_magid96 he always finds a way
@IscoDisco_23 for how long?
@A_magid96 nah enjoying this, but don't worry you guys will win.
@IscoDisco_23 same thing for us last season, 3adi m3leish
Madrid fans have no loyalty, already booing the players. -.-
@latifa_elhakim but..
Give em a break <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Madrid is still going to win..
And you laugh at Messi's lost header? He lost a clear shot after the penalty lol
He dived before the ball..
@AyahPickles @YourFaceIs7aram Harry potter.....

Woaaaaah
Nice one Cristiano.

Always feel like being the peaceful guy in a Twitter argument, but then I press discard so I won't get attacked too.
@ElafSharif @TheGoogleFactz lool unfortunately I don't think I even had a phone back then.
@latifa_elhakim because they'll take you for granted or nowadays they'll just screenshot and tell everyone you're obsessed with them.
@Mnor @MHamror lool did she just call her a slave?
Game time.
@ElafSharif @TheGoogleFactz where was this when I needed it, they had to cut it off of my finger.

3) Give advice instead of attacking or playing the sarcasm card, you're just embarrassing others this way.
2) Every human is entitled to give an opinion about whatever they want unless its personal and offensive, stop being hypocritical.
1)God forbid you ever tweet about religion, love, women or anything at all cause you'll just get bullied by people with different opinions.

@Iconic_Fadi he freaking made Boateng turn around till he slipped then he chipped it, which lucky player does that?
@SalahaldinAmin I bet Robben was injured for tactical reasons cause they knew Barca was too good. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Haha anyways, hard luck and good game.
@Iconic_Fadi how?
Amazing assist.
@ItsHosam I'm happy now, optimistic.
@ItsHosam no time, maybe tie or one at least.

I've been in Sudan for months and I'm 100% sure when I'm back in Malaysia I'll get messages from some people here saying "we should've met"
@Yousyasi @Fizzle707 they probably don't care either. 7adir I'll remember to be upset on that day.
@A_magid96 if I wasn't then I wouldn't worry about the electricity cutting lol.
People are more concerned about what an atheist would think of their opinion than a fellow Muslim.
@A_magid96 I'd rather not watch the game than attempt to watch it with Sudan's internet.
If the electricity cuts today during the UCL game tho...
@DAALLOOOO I'm glad I did.
@wasbornblue wallahi I find people with no traits to flaunt acting as if they're the kings of the universe while others encouraging them.
@LimzOya I don't think I can ever explain it well lol.
@wasbornblue fake comments, sweet lies and society's new form of influencing people to act confident which leads to cockiness.
@_Surrina well alhamdu li Allah then. :)
@Hajooouj still are, always discovering new things..
@LimzOya Lamya, try understanding smh, you probably didn't even bother.
@_Surrina according to that tweet and considering you had an English exam, I'm sure you did great. :)
@Hajooouj even the religious, shy and outcasts, Sudan sucked me in its black hole.
@Fizzle707 @Yousyasi no one cares about her birthday Farazdaq.
If I even made sense. #pt
Play a game where you mention things you like and the first person they remind you of, then go get the winner, cause love doesn't exist.
@Hajooouj at first I just thought its little kids trying to act foreign..etc then I found out adults do it too, literally all.
Don't lie &amp; feed a guy/girls ego, cause they'll start acting a personality that ain't theirs, flaunting traits they ain't got.
And every guy in Sudan is decent, people on the streets are family and nothing bad happens here. (He hasn't been here in many years) #pt
There was a time when thought that no one in Sudan dates, but better than my friend at uni that thinks every girl in Sudan wears hijab.
@Yousyasi @Fizzle707 3adi I've never got one.
@Yousyasi @Fizzle707 24/08. <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Yousyasi @Fizzle707 the person tells you their birthday and then you don't forget it again wala keif?

@latifa_elhakim I don't, I'm not white, I have real struggles. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@RozieeIdris ma into nas alriyadh. Anyways, I can explain, but they'll all think I'm a bit too obsessed.
@SUPERIORTEEN cant stand it.
@DAALLOOOO ya rab.
How do you explain to your grandma that the only reason you didn't visit much or sleepover during this break is cause their internet is E?
@DAALLOOOO Yes.

@khalidhamdi anything as long as its good people and food.
@ribrahxm and who does he get it from?
Lets have a Nas with no Electricity hangout where everyone can talk about their struggles from actual experience. #NWNE @NasWithNotepads
@khalidhamdi Yeah unfortunately.
@Hadeel_tita we grew up I guess? We act more busy even if we have some time to spare for eachother.
@UlaMohd @Maybe1Tomorrow number 16 jalat, bajeek bajeek.
Who wants to come sit outside with me as I use my laptop cause my phone died ages ago..
@RaWomentality Uni starts, till next year tani. :)
The moment I was leaving Omdurman the electricity came back and the moment I got home it cut, I guess I have to endure hell on both sides.
Got 4 cousins exactly my age and I don't talk to any of them anymore even tho we used to be very close.
@IscoDisco_23 @prodigical notice how I didn't say easy team, but the easiest of the 4 is what I meant. I'm hoping they have good tactics.
On the phone: Khalo keif tmam #SneakySmile 
And them also saying Barcelona is more fortunate to win against Bayern so our win won't be counted if we do. #pt
Madrid fans starting to say Juve is great and will beat them just so they won't get the "you had the easiest team" talk. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RaWomentality next time better be soon or you won't find me either.

They're flirting in English thinking I won't understand. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #PRT
@IscoDisco_23 @SalahaldinAmin official?
@RafaaAdil yeah she was for a while, bss hasi her boyfriend/fiance came and so I'm relieved, I literally sighed when he came, less awkward.
I swear I didn't make sense, I felt her thinking I'm crazy.
Lool this girl started talking to me about sitting with me on the same table cause the place is full and I started stuttering. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Hadeel_tita do you study at NRU wala shnu?

@Wadhahibrahim its like a wheel of fortune question game called Trivia crack.
I rarely use my coins on Trivia (double answer) and whenever I do I get the right answer from the first try. -.-
@Ibaa_T let me beat you mazinb_
@DAALLOOOO @ribrahxm got to be so*
@shathaelhassan3 I didn't say they don't, but I'm sure its less cause I was horrible, literally unbearable bullying and jokes.
@shathaelhassan3 on the contrary, I'm more calm now. Ask Alaa, Osman or Mohammed Salah how I was, everyone used to hate me lol.
@DAALLOOOO @ribrahxm she was being a rude British person as usual, they treat everyone in a really bad say so shakalato
@shathaelhassan3 Completely different social groups. <UNAMUSED FACE> 
@shathaelhassan3 I'm not deep and mysterious here tho. I'm annoying everywhere..
@ribrahxm @DAALLOOOO that's how you're going to do me?
@ribrahxm @DAALLOOOO o ana shnu?
@Balsum_ in shaa Allah your phones screen cracks again. :)
@Balsum_ ma3indi buttons.
@Balsum_ but everything sugarcoated a7la, especially the sour candy sugar.
@Balsum_ CALM DOWN WASHIK, I WAS CALM.
@Balsum_ plus I'm never deep, I'm really annoying hena so any outcome in real life should be satisfactory.
@DAALLOOOO does that include yourself..?
@DAALLOOOO I know..
@Balsum_ I don't remember mentioning awkward? I said lame, meaning annoying and says lame stuff while they're Shakespeare here.
I honestly cannot reply to any mention with someone random without opening their profile and dp, even if you're a robot.
@MazinB_ there was no need to say On Twitter again.
People on Twitter are so deep and mysterious on Twitter, but so lame in real life. Are we all like that? Social media dorks.
Feels so good to be back in bed after a long day out. (2hours)
@moecashabdalla True story. ^
@moecashabdalla deil awlad 3amleen feeha shafata awal ma takoon gidam shalom yigoolo leik matitnafas 3shan aboy bisma3ak
@MazinB_ you don't see flaws within yourself, you only see them on others. If mirrors tell the truth then why don't you believe them?
Guy looking like a lizard talking about how he doesn't want to marry a Sudanese girl, kade let her reply back to you then reject her.
Preach!
@moecashabdalla wallai ya Mohammed zahajoni 3deel garabta atshakal ma3ahom
@LimzOya I'd gladly stab them. :)
Don't make something normal and halal just because you do it and want to continue doing it comfortably.
I think I'm a feminist at this moment cause I'd like to beat up all the guys in the street rn. Yakh mashofto bit gabli kida? Washakom zato
Not a girl passes by without these group of men poking each other and analyzing her from head to toe.
I'm in no mood to interact with humans rn unless its brief.

@MazinB_ going on*
What the hell is going outside.. 
@bloodiigaki I might in shaa Allah
@bloodiigaki I think they said the government shut it down again. Nas with notepads is tomorrow tho.
@bloodiigaki week is 16/18  and the month is 69, but its much much better than the rest.
@bloodiigaki try *127*30# its the most decent one and for at least one month. If you're staying for less try *126*7# for a week, not bad.
@bloodiigaki 7amdu li Allah 3ala alsalama
@MoneeraY @TEDxKhartoumUni when is it?

@thedahlianasir the heat is unbearable.
Any of you ever tried spraying your bed with cold water when you're sleeping over at your grandma's zaman?
@UlaMohd @HurtCobaiin @YourFaceIs7aram nah
@YourFaceIs7aram dayman your bad, always thinking negatively about me.
@YourFaceIs7aram aha?
Someone else will think these normal things you do to be very bad and talk the same about you. #pt
You're judging someone and talking bad about them cause they do really bad stuff while you only do normal stuff? Its a cycle you know.
@YourFaceIs7aram @UlaMohd I heard its a myth told by others to make us hopeful and eager to live.
