Oh! I hope so!!!!! 
@kokeytakokez I also think because she doesn't identify with black, she doesn't connect with Godfrey
Unfortunately 
Would love for that to happen!!! But Brittnee wouldn't do that though 
Godfrey is king!!!! 
I wish here was away Brittnee could get rid of Sarah next, she has been so useless for her game #BBCAN3
That's what I've been saying! #BBCAN3  
NOT so low key as all that! 
EXACTLY!!!!! 
EXACTLY but a lot of people don't see that or refuse to see it! ..Sorry jumping into your convo ! 
Today stats: One follower, One unfollower and followed one person via

@deedee42066 Brittnee won the HN secret power! She can take herself and the other nom off the block!!
GO ON BRITTNEE!!! GWAN!!! GIRlL GWAN!!!!! #BBCan3
Brittnee's back is always against the wall and she always finds away to fight back!!! Yet again Sarah is riding her coat tails! #BBCAN3

üá®üá¶<CROWN><PRINCESS>üèΩ<HONEYBEE>üá®üá¶
Go on Queen B!!!! Go on with your bad self!!!!! #BBCan3
And yet people will continue to talk shot about Brittnee !!! What excuses do you have now for her excellent game play?!! #BBCan3
YES queen Brittnee does it again!!!!! #BBCAN3
Ya! I agree with you even Ash and Zach  
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Yes that is very! True! Who do you think should go up? Bruno and Zach ? Or a mix of one of them and one of the girls 
Lol ya he is! I'm glad she let him know hat she knows!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
LOL Brittnee is exposing Bruno! No he's barred ! #BBCAN3
8 pm cannot come fast enough !!! #BBCAN3
I hope. Britt did! But it won't be a shock if neither of them find it <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE> 
Sarah talks a lot!! But most of it is not worth listening to Bruno has her pegged! #BBCAN3
YES!!!!! ME TOO!!! I would be voted out really early on!!! Be tolerance when I smell BS!! #bbcan3  
Brittnee telling it straight to Bruno #BBCAN3
@whyyougottaask your tweets crack me up!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Sigh!!!! Epic!!!! 
<FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE>WHAT??? NOOOOO!!!! 
I'm watching the Episode where Brittnee and that girl was put on slop by Canada...poor Britt thinks Canada is punishing her not true #BBCAN3
Oh I hope so!!! 
Guilty conscience  
Pawn target target pawn she was both all season and Kevin started that trend ...if they dish it they can take it 
@BigBrotherCA has screwed up sonar times this season this would be more of an expectation. I agree with you  
Britt was only returning the favour because they BOTH chose her has a pawn for NO damn reason ! Dish it and take it 
So Sarah is trying to get her claws in Pilar! I hope it back fires  #BBCAN3
EXACTLY!!! Hit it seems that is the general consensus for viewers also. Because it's Brittnee 
Brittnee and Sarah did NOT!!! Play the same game! Britt's own was way better! #BBCAN3
Love how Sarah is  back tracking on why she voted out Willow ...yet it's Britt's fault for nominating her?! Wow! #BBCAN3
Willow claiming to take Britt to the F2 is a damn lie! She should have worked with her then from the start! Who is she kidding #BBCAN3
Are Rodney's muscles filled with air??<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> he's struggling to hold on to the rope!#SurvivorWorldsApart
@carab1985 and again @BigBrotherCA manipulated a comp for Sarah to win and she lost it. Yet Britt is not a good game player! How? #BBCAN3
I think that is exactly what @BigBrotherCA is trying to do! I have no respect for "production" 
@carab1985 for me I don't agree with her social views and I don't understand the whole unhygienic life style!
@BigBrotherCA under estimated their audience and have taken no responsibility for it as a result Sarah is disliked 
But Sarah had no control over that @BigBrotherCA chose her for that and allowed it it's them to blame!  

Everyone else: NOPE

#BBCAN3
Watching last week's episode of #SurvivorWorldsApart lol no love for Rodney on his birthday!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@carab1985 I think it's her "free spirit" and many agree with her views. I don't agree with either!
Who Sarah ? I would like to know ! Cus I can't see it! 
You lost me? Don't understand why what? 
I'm interested to see what happens after this power has been played! For the HN #BBCAN3
Willow and Sarah were loyal to each other, Pili to Kev and ash to Zach, no has ever had Britt's back! Ever! #BBCAN3
I'm not optimistic! Sarah moved without integrity or loyalty unlike other alliance but yet she is loved #BBCAN3  
Now!! That I would love to see happy ! But Britt will be trashed forsaking Sarah cry!  
If you have your opinion then don't tweet me and I won't give you my opinion. #JustSaying #BBCAN3  
I don't care about Bruno or Zach  
This is utter crap I'm reading here!! #BBCAN3 utter crap 
At least Britt played with integrity because it's no big deal her only ally throws her UTB!Yet BRitt is who ppl are looking down on #BBCAN3
Uuummshe has been throwing Britt UTB since the beginning! And Britt has not done that to her ever. WOW! #BBCAN3  
Wow one vote...and I still don't think so, he would never do that to Pili  
Brittnee has Sarah's back this whole game and it was never reciprocated  #BBCAN3
If through throwing your alliance member under the bus as every turn is good game play?! No thank #BBCAN3  
I'm not even sure she will even win against Ash or Pili. Britt is respected by no one. #BBCAN3  
Maybe Britt should have been as loyal to their alliance as Sarah was.  Sarah hid behind Britt while Throwing her UTB!BBCAN3
Ppl are salty cus Willow went out on Britt's HOH, just because they loved swillow !! Oh please! Britt is the true under dog #BBCAN3
Yes she would have gone home if not for the twist! But everyone used her as a pawn! Everyone HOH! Why target just 1 
She can't take her cus she won't win! Sarah ahead done nothing but be shady and it's gotten get nothing #BBCAN3  
Hell ya !!! 
But Britt felt threatened by willow's relationship with Sarah, so she did what she needed to do! #BBCAN3  
I will be ecstatic!!! If Godfrey wins !!! #BBCAN3  
I'm saying she's a bad player! Sarah stinks in more ways than one! #BBCAN3  
EXACTLY!!!!!! 
LMAO!!! Not trolls but, they need to give Britt her well deserved credit! Fair is fair #BBCAN3  
For Sarah to cut ppl she needed to win HOH or something before now! Sarah only throws ppl UTB 
No! The right choice was Willow and yes Britt would have been out of not for the twist, pawns eventually go 
But ppl are saying that Pili, Ash and Sarah are playing better than Britt. #BBCAN3  
EXACTLY!!! And tha is what is happening!!! #BBCAN3  
They all suck! Ash too but Willow needed to go!! 
Was it not obvious that Pilar took all o her instruction from other ppl the child said she didn't know what to do 
EXACTLY!!! Now I'm hearing she shold have never put up Willow! Why the hell not! She hasn't done shit also #BBCAN3  
I think no matter what Britt does people just won't like her! All season her back was against a wall. #BBCAN3
Why ??? Willow was the right choice to be put up! Why should she have put up Godfrey?! #BBCAN3  
Exactly !!!!!! 
It pisses me off that ppl are seeing Sarah as a better game player than Brittnee!! That is a load of shit!!! #BBCAN3
Sarah won one damn comp!! And NOT on the block every week NOR on slop most of the game Sarah has done nothing 
And ppl putting down Britt for being emotional, she was on slop and OTB the entire game!!  What do people expect from her?? #BBCAN3
I see that!! And how the hell!!! Did Pili play a good game???#BBCAN3  
So do people think Britt's game sucks but Sarah's was stellar ? Cus that's a load of crap! And Pili didn't do much either ! #BBCAN3
Ok, but what has Sarah done in comparison? 
I don't understand why Brittnee is still getting bashed for her game?! She won HOH twice and got out big players!!! #BBCAN3
Who's lovely? 
Ok, thanks!

I know!!' I wish she could see that !!!' 
LMAO!!!!!... 
Exactly ! 
Hhhaaaahhhaaaahhhaaaa.....uummm.............ok 
Sarah has done nothing but throw Britt under the bus at every turn! And complain  
Ya I know!!! And I'm the bitter one!! Clearly they don't always watch the feeds!!' 
And they gave it to her and her and Willow shared the wine alone by the pool...again ....she was a HN 
Set it up for her to win and she still failed ?! Or when she was a HN and requested wine to take Willow on a date  
I'm not bitter! Did not remember when Sarah was ....crying! When she didn't win HOH and admitted that production  
YES! YES! YES!!!!!!!!!!  
You are NOT alone and at this point I don't want to know! I'm so sick of hearing about them<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 

This just shows that Britt game isn't that bad  she made it this far with a crappy alliance #BBCAN3
She's popular with production 
Yes!!!!!! 
Self evict Sarah!!!!! Please!!! #BBCAN3 
Uugghh why did Britt align herself with this Sarah!! I cannot stand her!!! #BBCAN3
Exactly hypocrisy at its finest !!!! 
So Sarah and Britt are fit sure have nots??? 
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
No dont encourage her... I want her to go this week!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
No, but I never speak with confidence when it comes to this game! Sarah is suppose to be the target 
Thank you feed #2 of much rather watch Ash do herald than Sarah crying....again!! #BBCAN3
Ya....I know  
Preach it!!!! 
Yesterday Ash said it was Sarah but things change so quickly so now I'm not sure 
She's is @BigBrotherCA pet the cameras follow her every where  
Hoping Britt, Godfrey or Bruno wins POV #BBCAN3
Sarah and Godfrey  
More the former, than  the later.....<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE> 
Ya she did say that yesterday, I hope Sarah goes next 
Who is on the block with her ? 
For the past 2 days every time I turn on the feeds, they get cut ... Getting a complex here! #BBCAN3
My aunt and God mother went home to be with the Lord on Wednesday May 6th...I will miss her deeply...<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>

Lol !!!! What are you booing??? 
It's soooo!!!! Refreshing to watch the feeds and not have Gollum (Willow) popping up in every corner with her annoying self ! #BBCAN3
Sarah and Godfery don't think there will be Any HN this week!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>...oh what fun to come!! #BBCAN3
Wow!!!! Good for Bruno! I'm sorry Global is not showing us any of the fights #BBCAN3  
I would be ecstatic!!! If Ash sends out Sarah next!!! #BBCAN3
Ok that makes sense 
It was my fault, I'm half asleep. Ash won HOH correct? 
#BBCAN3
Do you believer her that she would get her showmance out? Especially over Godfrey? 
Why do the feeds keep cutting out? #BBCAN3
@BBUSFan101 it still didn'tKe sense for Sarah not to vote to save her little pet Gollum, you cannot assume what others would do #BBCAN3
Lol and I would have been ecstatic  
I wonder if it was Sarah evicted with her would she have been that "devastated" 
@BBUSFan101 lmao!!! Willow looks so pathetic on the stage with Arisa <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@BBUSFan101 Bruno makes no sense!!! He voted to save Willow???
If being nominated for eviction on a TV show is the lowest moment of willow's life! Then she has had a really good life #BBCAN3
@BBUSFan101 hhhmmm ok
@BBUSFan101 why did Bruno use the POV on Zach?! I thought Zach was one of his targets ?

@BBUSFan101 I didn't fully understand the HN noms so I nominate Zach and Sarah. I realized the twist after locking in my noms<NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
Now watching last night's eviction episode #BBCAN3
It hurts to see my mom cry and can't do anything about it.
Wide awake
I hope it gets interesting here on out! 
I hope so, I kinna messed up there. 
But I didn't realize there was a have not power <CONFOUNDED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE> vote is already locked in 
Sarah and Zach  
I've voted to unlock the Have-Not Special Power in the #BBCAN3 #TwistosTwist @BigBrotherCA 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower and righteous run into it and they are saved! Blessed be the name of the Lord most high!

Oh ok! It's so strange to see her cry 
Has pili cried at all this season until now? 
Sarah has no true loyalty to anyone 
Well now she is gonna latch on to Pilli...poor Pilli and she should self evict if she is so devastated  
I love!!!!! Britt but I wish Sarah went out the door along with Willow  
But seems I missed the best night ever for TV!!! 
Oh! I know it was. 
I see from the feeds Kev, Bobby and Willow are out ! 
@BBUSFan101 I just saw your gif to me I still haven't seen the episode but I recon I will like the out come.
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.....blessed be the name of the Lord.
@CHill_BBfan neither will Sarah, she will take Willow, there is no one there will take Britt to the end
@CHill_BBfan I meant she doesn't need Sarah
But if she can align with Godfrey and Bruno I'd be happy, does need Sarah, I wish she never made a deal with her 
I hope they do! And I hope she believes them!!! And I hope she puts her up  
If Britt didn't win HOH she was going home, so I am happy! #BBCAN3
Even Sarah too 
@silverscorpio12 I want to see that but or doesn't seem like that's what she wants
Yes  true but!! She did put Kevin up next to him that took guts also. And it was early on so Graig was a target  
Lol !!!!!! 
@silverscorpio12 exactly and pili and ash will follow Sarah Britt has no one in the house
I was already giving up! 
@silverscorpio12 oh for sure and Sarah will attack hard!
She's the one that put up Kevin and Graig and got Graig voted out...soooo..... 
@silverscorpio12 that is the perfect situation I would love to see that happen!!!
@mal32918 yes I am !!!!! #BBCAN3 go queen B!!!!! 
Yes she will !!!!!!!! 
@LindaDeakins1 here's to Brittnee winning HOH!!! #BBCAN3 
YyyyAaaaaassasss I do !!!!!! 
If the rumours are true !!! That is 2 HOH wins!! Now maybe people will stop saying she hasn't done anything in the house! Go Britt #BBCAN3
Oooohhhhhhhooooooo!!!!!!!

@BBUSFan101 does Sarah want Britt to go over Bobby?
So Sarah wanted to vote out Britt?? 
They tried to get Sarah to do what ? 
So is the plan still to get out Bobby? #BBCAN3

What are you referring to? 
Brittnee won an HOH and sent Graig home...how are people calling her the weakest player? So what is Willow and Ash???? #bbcan3
@BigBrotherCA  
This is the worst season thus far.  
People either don't watch the show or they are playing dumb! 
Brittnee was HOH and she got out Graig!! What has Willow, Ashleigh or Sarah done??  My goodness even Pilar was HOH!! #bbcan3
Summer camp is so fun.I got to choose a prize&amp;I chose a lobster costume! I hope Kevin will think Im cute &lt;3‚Ä¶
Sadly no 
<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE> 
Why Britt???? 
I'm wondering the same thing!!!! 
I honestly don't think she would! Sarah is always running Britt over with a bus! 
Hhhmmmm... Listen to Sarah dominate yet another convo or listen to ash and pili<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE>...wow some choice #BBCAN3

But Sarah is their pet also. 
Because you use logic and knowledge when you think and speak! 
Nice!!! 
Me too! I'm shocked to think that Kevin thought it was real ! 
How extremely disappointing! So know Britt has a good chance of going home! 
@bluejoni so Kevin never intended to use the actual veto?! He was hoping Bobby would use his fake one and take himself down?! That's stupid
FACE PALM!!!!! 
@DonnaMay5 so does the house know that Bobby lied?
So I'm guessing then that everyone now knows that Bobby lied about having a secret veto? #BBCAN3
So it seems wow! 
Thank you! 
I didn't mean Godfrey, I made a mistake I meant Britt. I hope it is Bobby going home and not Britt 
So who is getting evicted Britt or Bobby? #BBCAN3
So who is going home? Godfrey or Bobby? 
What have I missed? What is Kevin going to do? 
Holy holy! God Almighty! The Great I AM you are worthy none besides thee the Great IAM!!!! #Jesus

Well we already know who he nominated. I just wanna cut to the chase and see who he takes off and who he puts up <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
Yes that's true lol!!!! 
Kevin's HOH is making for great feeds and good tv!! #BBCAN3
Isn't Sunday's episode the HOH comp? 
I'm liking the confusion Kevin is throwing it makes me look forward to Monday's episode even more!  #BBCAN3
EXACTLY!!!!!! 
Exactly !! 
I think Kev is the first HG where not even the viewer really knows what his game play is! Talk about suspenseful !!! #BBCAN3
Lol Kevin has a great poker face! He bluffs so well!! So it's hard to know which convo of his to believe!  
I must have not caught it!  
I know Sarah told her don't say that! But when did Willow ever correct herself? 
This would be more effective if @BigBrotherCA didn't provide the alcohol to Sarah. Production fav 
Not too many people were upset when Willow compared Zach to hitler and herself to the persecuted Jews of that time 
There is a double standard or something going on! Nonetheless I busted out laughing <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
I thought it was pretty same funny too!!! 
That's what Bruni just finish saying!!!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@BBUSFan101 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

#BBCAN3 
#BBCAN3
@BreJohnx0  he said he will use the veto on Britt and put up Bruno and vote him out, I'm torn cus I like Bruno. But it is good game play
Oh lol then cry about after and say how everyone hates her!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
Do what? 
But Brittnee you are light skinned!!! Unless you consider that a bad thing?! #bbcan3
I'd prefer Sarah go before Bobby and Bruno  
@BreJohnx0 looks like you are getting the drama you've been looking for !!!! #BBCAN3
He told Sarah that he will use the veto on Britt and put up Bruno 
If all goes well, Bobby leaves 4-3 (I hope).
I would love that to be true. 
Her game play is cheesing me!!! She has to get proactive and stop playing the victim! 
Today stats: No new followers, 2 unfollowers and followed one person via 
YAAASSS !!!! I can't wait!!!!  
@tzulu1914 and they did wow!!! To bad we had to wait for another 2 years or so in sure for the 3rd one
I got to the theatre at 7:30 and got into the 10pm show! It is so awesome!! I didn't think they cold out so the 1st 
Haven't seen Britt in the feeds?! #BBCAN3
@tzulu1914 FYI ....Avengers Age of Ultron was amazing!!!! I want to see it again!!!
Figures feeds have been down all day ! Now just as I'm able to settle in and watch they are all going to bed! #BBCAN3
Yes very true!!!! 
@tzulu1914 I don't think the other HG are too concerned about their "relationship " lol...that plan is kinda weird !
Lmao!!!! 
But... Does anyone care?! 
Oh ok? But why??? 
Can anyone tell me why Sarah and Willow are pretending to fight?
 #BBCAN3
I like Britt more than her anyway.
Lawd!!!!! Ok! 
@Melyorkie so who won POV ? And who is OTB with Britt ?
Avengers Age of Ultron is a MUST see!!!!!!
about 3-4 hours 
So excited !!! Avengers Age of Ultron tonight !!! Woooohoooo!!!!!
Face palm 
Why you say that!?? 
????? 
Lmao!!!!! Yes!!!!! 
Those HG were always fighting and scheming this year it's flat line! No pulse  
Lmao!!! You I was thinking! Last year it was so hard to turn off the feeds cus it was one crazy scene after another 
Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!? 
That  #BBCAN3 the movie is so stupid!
lol what coincidence !!!! And in Toronto too!!! 
I don't know how people aren't seeing this stuff??? I just don't get how she is fooling so many??? 
Kevin Pillar is a catcher for the Toronto Blue Jays!!! I had to share this!!! #BBCAN3 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Good !!!!!! 
Sarah leaving would make me happy!!! 
This week Kevin won a game!
we're staying for 1 more week!
I have this dumb costume but it's ok!
Having fun!
Xoxo‚Ä¶
Ya I know. 
Ya I know it would be a poor game move for him 
That might be true although it may even be better if Zach went up! But I know that's far fetched  
I like both Bruno and Godfrey I wold prefer Bobby get evicted  
I heard that he aid that, it seems he is telling everyone what they want to hear, time will tell 
Very true. 
I don't know if Kev is telling the truth but to Britt and Zach he said Godfrey is getting BD... 
Wh am I not shocked that Willow is referencing Sharon,Lois and bram <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>that explains somethings  #BBCAN3
Did you really just say that!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
Ohhhh....hhhmmmm ... Didn't know that...but I don't want Bruno or Godfrey to go! 
Them winning isn't the point! They will do what ever their hubby's tell them to do!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Oh! I don't know cus this morning with Zach and Britt he said Godfrey...hhhmmm don't know !! 
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>ya! Ok ! 
I can't with this girl .....I just can't !!! 
He says its Godfrey he is gonna BD 
I know!!!!! Uughhhh!!!!! 
EXACTLY!!! That pot she's always smoking must give her intellect beyond any learning institution one would attend  
@BigBrotherCA thinks she is the star of the show! 
Today is Koshar vs Halal and why they are the same! Like shut up!!!!  
There isn't one topic that Sarah isn't an "expert" on yesterday it was tweaking and why Pili is not good at it

Is Sarah a world traveller ? Or has she studied many cultures in university? She must have or be someone. To know so much! #BBCAN3
@BigBrotherCA loves Sarah they are forcing her down people's throat...why I don't know!!!  
Kosher and Halal are not the same Sarah...you don't have to have an opinion on every subject of you don't know say you don't know. #BBCAN3
There Sarah goes again....uugghhhh!!! #BBCAN3

Goodfrey says a girl has two things her ass and boobs ....oh Godfrey!!!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I have a feeling you are very single! #BBCAN3
Lol ok. 
I don't think Brittnee should be sharing this with Sarah .... Not everything you have to tell, keep some stuff to yourself!!!  #BBCAN3
What do you mean? 
No doubt, it's gonna be interesting with this triple evict. Which is another reason I don't want him as HOH 
That's why I'm hoping he sticks to his word. I prefer he not win HOH. We will see 
He said there are bigger targets to go after and the house is about to explode 
He told her if he wins HOH next week she is not going OTB! And that she is in the best position in the house 
She isn't  
Godfrey is zach's biggest target. 
He said the game is about to blow up and she out of most is in the best position 
Told her that he hopes he wins next HOH and he promises not to put her up. There are much bigger targets to go after 
I hope Zach is telling Britt the truth  #BBCAN3
Vitamins are medications too people! So yes you can over dose on vitamins !! #BBCAN3
Pilar is perfect for that lobster costume!!! #BBCAN3
Ok thanks ! 
Oh ok, so you know who are nominated ? I know it's Britt is the other person Bobby? 
So who won the veto? #BBCAN3
Today stats: 6 followers, 2 unfollowers and followed 4 people via 
@KevinsPilars and Willow is nothing more than BBcan's version of Gollum
@KevinsPilars BB rigged the last HOH for Sarah to win an she lost! At least Pili win an HOH without production setting up for her
That's laughable to me cus  neither Willow or Sarah has potential 
Poor Pili is easier to manipulate so I'm surprised Sarah would vote her out before ash  
Keeping pili is a better choice for advancement. Ash knows how to play the game she is able to think things through 
Pili 
Lmaoooo!!!!!!!!  Yes it would !!!!! I like mine in soup !!!! 
I anticipate needed an oxygen tank close by cus Godfrey would go all out  
I agree but I would love to see him win! Watching Zach walk out and all Gidfreys antics would be a riot!! 
Hey !!!!! I like Bok Choy don't ruine that veggie for me please!!!'<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@ChrisTaylor8859 sorry, I should stop! I could go on  and on....lol
@ChrisTaylor8859 km no fan of zach's but he clearly likes his women with a spine and a healthy self image
@ChrisTaylor8859 and Willow complains that Zach treats her like shit good God she called him hitler the other night!
@ChrisTaylor8859 early on she complained that no one wants to be in a showmance with her! Really ...try brushing your teeth
It's all personal. I think anyway 
@ChrisTaylor8859 she is jealous and is also feeding off if willow's jealousies and dangerous insecurities! Uncool
@ChrisTaylor8859 she secretly wants to be in a showmance but has realized it will never happen as a result she hates those who are in one
@ChrisTaylor8859 and it is very clear Willow needs to see a psychologist she has emotional issues and Sarah is using that to her advantage
@ChrisTaylor8859 and she throws Britt under buss at any opening she sees for higher ground. She is NOT loyal
@ChrisTaylor8859 she knows plenty about nothing at all. But comes across convincingly to many...not me!
@ChrisTaylor8859  then I noticed she has an answer for everything. There is not one subject that she doesn't have an opinion on.
For me it started with the poor hygiene. I could smell her through my I pad mini screen. 
What has she done for people not to like her? 
Oh! Lol sorry! I am no Sarah fan, I can't tolerate her or Willow. 
Frankie was able to win comps when the odds were stacked against him. Sarah just occupies space. 
Hope so! 
Exactly!!!!! 
Woo hooo!!!! Cus Britt is a lot nicer !!! 
Yes they are!!!!!

If Sarah ever flipped on Willow, Willow would not recover from that! Too emotionally on stable! #BBCAN3

LMAO!! Willow and Sarah are annoying, and all that self pity is too much  
I will support Pilar over Sarah and Willow any day! I have zero tolerance for those two! #BBCAN3
Willow needs meds! Earlier she said the whole house hates her cus of the comp

Yes exactly!!!!! 
Lol I stopped watching a few episodes back. 
@BBCan3Bruno  is a real gentleman on the show! Very respectful to everyone. I love his game !
40 something's also...I need to feel apart of this thing too lol 
Yes very true!!! But I feel that Kev has solid relationship in the house unlike Zach, I don't know 
I guess she should have been nominated 4 times and on slop 3 times instead of Britt. No one gives her a hard time 
I think Bobby might get targeted next  
But they don't know about the triple  
That would be awesome! 
He had a criptic convo with Sarah about noms , he didn't say much

Sorry, Bobby or Bruno for what??? 
To do what though??? 
What is Kevin really planning ??? #BBCAN3
@BreJohnx0 after the comp Willow said she knows now that no one in the house really likes her. She went around telling everyone this

A triple eviction in my perfect world wold be Sarah, Willow and Bobby!!! #BBCAN3
Looking forward to it! 
Exactly!!!! Britt is too polite to go off on people! Willow is very unstable  
Oh lol this season was awful poor casting and terrible producing! Hope next year is better 
@DonnaMay5  is BB going back to slice next year ?
Really??!! Britt the model is grateful for $42.00 !!! Oh Britt you are too nice for this game!!! #BBCAN3
These HG aren't too sharp this season <CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE>

@deedee42066 feeds are back
Feeds are back #BBCAN3
Maybe , but Zach was in Mid task. But who knows! 
Hey were oblong enough for weeping willow to say that no one in the house likes her based on the comp they just did 
As soon as Britt got on the table to get a massage from Zach production cut the feeds they were up for 10 min. Or so 
I've come to think viewers aren't actually listening to things these HG are saying! Or they just simply don't care 
I know!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm fed up with her 
For Britt being on the block? Yup!!! And Bruno is pushing for her eviction she is such a threat <NEUTRAL FACE> 
@bluejoni and just before the feeds went down Willow was saying to everyone that no one likes her buts it's ok. Something to do with a comp
I think she is a have cus she thanked BB for the sweet potato fries in the freezer  
So glad that Britt is a have this week! #BBCAN3
So Bobby's on slop  #BBCAN3
Bruno is getting a rub down by Zach ....ok?!! #BBCAN3
Feeds are back #BBCAN3
Yes 
Pilar's HOH was a team effort !!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I have no real issue with the DA just wish they would leave Britt and Godfrey alone. Every week these 2 have to fight  to stay! #BBCAN3
I'd be pissed and find it hilarious all T the same time! 
I think Bruno is a good player! But big moves will make for excitement ! 
That would be awesome! 
Sarah would through Britt first ! Britt is afraid to make enemies. Sarah is more protected than Britt 
Finally truth being spoken in my time line !!! @BigBrotherCA  
Exactly !!! Even though it made good tv, it was detrimental for her game 
She was so anxious, and was afraid to allow things to unfold  
Go and find people who share your favs and have convos with them. And don't mind the rest of us 
Ok! But we weren't talking to you? You joined a convo that you weren't even apart of! We all have favs.  
@BigBrotherCA  
@BigBrotherCA knew they were wrong and didn't have the courage to admit it so they had Willow lie and say she won  
What do you care what we think? You have your opinion and we have ours. What seems to be the problem for you? 
Nope  
That's Sarah's M.O. 
@BigBrotherCA  
@BigBrotherCA  
But only some! Not the majority 
They wanted to create a gay story line and gave them alcohol to facilitate that! @BigBrotherCA  epic fail  
It should be allowed or then do something about someone going OTB 4 times! Help all or help no one @BigBrotherCA  
Oh ya 100% 
@bluejoni @BigBrotherCA but why is a fixed allowed for her?! What is the end result ??
@bluejoni yet!!! Britt is being put on the block for a 4th time !! And it's ok!! @BigBrotherCA
I am so pissed especially at @BigBrotherCA for manipulating the game to give Sarah privileges and to win comps 
@bluejoni 3 am this morning she was crying and telling Willow that @BigBrotherCA fixed the HOH for her to win and she failed
@bluejoni nope! Sarah early this AM crying by the HT that she didn't win HOH and apologized to Canada for not winning it!
Nope! 
@BigBrotherCA  
If Sarah cares so much for Britt why doesn't she go up OTB?! @BigBrotherCA will save her anyway! Pretend to be the hero! #BBCAN3
You are not the Grimm Reaper Britt....you're just the wrong demographic #TrueStory #BBCAN3
The problem is Britt is too nice for this game! This is the reason why she needed a showmance to be protected, just like Pili #BBCAN3
@BigBrotherCA would never allow such a thing. They need people they can manipulate  
Exactly Britt no one will understand until they have sat there 4 times !!! #BBCAN3
Ir amazes me how viewers are justifying Britt always being a pawn! I bet if they were on the show, they would like it! #BBCAN3
Notice when Sara was having pity party a camera stays on her! But don't show Brittnee when she is down! Favouritism @BigBrotherCA #BBCAN3
I really don't understand ! Ash talks about bullying I think Brittnee gets bullied every single week!!!! #BBCAN3
So why not Willow or Sarah as a pawn?? Why always Britrnee??? #BBCAN3
Go away Bruno uughhhh!!!!! 
Brittnee needs to be more assertive with Kevin!!  He has not offered a good reason for nominating her again!!!! #BBCAN3
@silverscorpio12 @BrittneeeBBCAN3 woooohoooo!!!!
@BreJohnx0 Bobby wants to win the POV so that Godfrey will go home, that's his reason for wanting to go OTB
Yup! But Kevin wants to put Britt up as a pawn....surprise surprise!  
Exactly !! She is n detox !!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.. Just wish that included less talking ! 
So Sarah is an expert on tweeting now?! Sit there and stay quiet!! Honestly ! Shut yup!!! #bbcan3
Yup! Sadly enough it will. They are nominated every damn week without cause  
Sarah's self pity is annoying ! @BigBrotherCA should never rig a comp for someone to win #BBCAN3. Not all of Canada like you Sarah!
Today stats: No new followers, One unfollower via 
I agree !!! And it's very obvious him and Britt are going OTB!  
It is smart bc they are hiding behind the boys. I wouldn't but it's working for them! For now  
LMAO! But production needed to cast better players!  
Will get them far not to win but the final 3 and 4 pot head, Willow and unfortunately Britt win make it that far  
I'm not a fan of the DA but they are playing a really smart game! Especially Pilar and Ash their  passivity  
Lol!! But that's the show! They knew what they signed up for this high school revisits the cool kids &amp; the outsiders 
But whose fault is that! The players are to blame for their crappy game play! 
That's what I was just told. I'm glad that she lost! Nothing should ever be fixed for anyone @BigBrotherCA  
I'm glad that she didn't win HOH!! That fiasco with her getting alcohol was wrong! And I don't like either of them 2 
I guess if a tv show constantly give Sarah privileges that she doesn't deserve! It's only fitting she assumes she would win the HOH! #bbcan3
I still don't understand ??? Does she think that BB made so that she would lose ? Is that what she thinks  
Production did what? Made so that she wouldn't win HOH? 
So why is Sarah crying? #BBCAN3
Exactly!!!! @BigBrotherCA lied 
Uummm...my tweet said! If it's true Kevin won HOH Brittnee will be one of the 3 going home ! 
So who evicted the other 2? 
Brittnee needs to play a better game! If Kevin is HOH? I think she is gone be one of the three to be evicted next week #BBCAN3
You are NOT a failure Sindy the house is full of idiots! Especially that DA !!!  #BBCAN3
@BigBrotherCA  
I don't know, but none the less Willow is a moron. This is NOT on Zach 
@BigBrotherCA thinks the viewers must be stupid not to notice these things #epic fail  
NOPE!! And it was @BigBrotherCA that gave her the alcohol NOT Willow they lied in this episode

See...oh porcupine!!! Pili isn't cut out for this game.... Wow  
Awe!!!! LMAO!!!! Don't cast your pearls before swine! Let the girl rot in her own ignorance. 
@bluejoni I blocked her earlier cus she said the most ignorant things. I can't deal with brain dead people
Oh lol.. I was wondering!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>thanks! 
But I do think she is not cut out for BB. She is not a very good game player  
I don't think Pilli has ever used racist comments. She has never attacked anyone's character.  
Ok! Who is being yelled at here?! I'm confused?!<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE> 
Did pilar say something? Maybe I missed it..... Sorry I didn't know 
Never, Pilar is all sunshine, unicorns, cotton candy and oh ya! Kevin!!! 
@bluejoni @melaniepaul222 @KevinsPilars Zach doesn't need her apology her family and friends do.  Cus if I were them I'd be embarrassed!
Willow has ruined her credibility. But she has been doing that from the beginning. To me she looks pathetic  
No of course not!!! Never ever! But it's all on Willow, Zach is in the clear 
Comment I think she is the one that looks bad. If anything people I hope  empathize with Zach. At least I do 
I honestly don't think so, it's more on Willow than Zach. I don't think people are associating him with her obscene  
I honestly think there are serious issues with Willow, mentally and emotionally. 
Zach and the rest of the house is unaware of the comment. So he will hear it when the show is over.  
I never could stand Willow or Sarah And that manufactured  date by @BigBrotherCA was on the lowest level #BBCAN3

Hhhhaaaahhhhaaaahhhaaaaa!!!!! Nooo!!!!  You are not stupid!!! An yes we do tan even on purpose apparently  
Lmao!!!! That sounds like me 
@bluejoni most people are asleep and don't even know it
You can see by the what BB shows us as well as how people respond. It's sad really.  
Mind control is a real thing. 
Lol I know I sound like an idiot. 
As u said it's not the ability that surprises me its the desire to cus we have naturally what others want to achieve 
@Melyorkie watch! I'm gonna go into work this eve and ask all my West Indian co workers if they go sun tanning <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>I need to know now!

@Melyorkie they hide in the shade all summer long! Even that is funny to me
Wow!!!! Not one person I know who is black tans. I love the sun. But I've only know ppl to hide in the shade 
@Melyorkie I suppose, to me it's like re-baking a cake that's already baked. Well I learned something I guess. Lol thanks!
@Melyorkie even someone with Godfrey's complexion? He can't get darker than that?
Wow! I can't lie! That is not familiar to me! But why?  
Every summer my sister says she looks like a raccoon<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
@kokeytakokez for Britt she clearly has some identification issues, but Godfrey?! The dude is blerk!!! What he doing sun tanning
@kokeytakokez but to put on sun tan lotion and lay out in the sun like white people do is strange and stupid
Yes that raccoon look my sis gets it I don't like shades. lol  
The sun is attracted to black, and our skin is already dark so you would get darker quickly. Ppl with pale skin need 
I'm honestly not familiar with black people tanning, we all love the warmth of the sun but to actively tan, I don't understand it. #BBCAN3
EXACTLY!!!!!!!!  
Yes !!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
100% agreed! They also underestimated the viewers.  
Sindy would have done better in season 2. They were there to play. This group is there to make out  #BBCAN3
Because @BigBrotherCA allowed it, for no good reason! She won't be punished. It was productions stupid move 
Even when Sindy is quiet you can see the game play going on in her brain!  #BBCAN3
Can't hear Godfrey and Sindy's convo #BBCAN3
Let's get them both to stop talking! I can't stand either one of them!!!!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> 
@DonnaMay5 lol ok!!
@DonnaMay5 Willow even compared Zach to hitler!!!!
@DonnaMay5 they were kissing getting drunk and insulting all the boys in the house
@DonnaMay5 the feeds got cut at one point because a whole lot of us complained!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><CONFUSED FACE>

Sarah you would have plenty to do if you would just self evict  #BBCAN3
@DonnaMay5 what did you think about the late night feed? Sarah a have not getting alcohol to go on a date with Willow?
I would love Big Brother to give Sarah a task where she can't speak for 24 hours!  #BBCAN3
A life size  tumour  all the more reason for him to use sun screen and not spray tan <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Right there with you. *taps out*

*head asplodes* #bbcan3
That's exactly what I was thinking! 
Honestly! Who casted Sarah and Willow??? @BigBrotherCA, that person needs to lose their job! #BBCAN3
That is the only reason Willow is all up under Sarah is because Zach rejected her. No other reason.  #BBCAN3
@BigBrotherCA gave Sarah the have not alcohol so she and her pet can go on a date. Rule bending 
Willow has very low self esteem and Sarah used it to her advantage almost reminds me of Kev and pilar weak people 
Lmao!!I think stinky never showers Sarah likes the girls but Willow will lay down for who ever shows her attention  
As for me I'm not into girls making out. So  I'm not sorry the feeds were cut. 
Well Sara is a have not so some are wondering why was she given alcohol to share with Willow  
I much rather watch HG sleep than to see Sarah and her pet so thanks!! @BigBrotherCA #BBCAN3
*is in a showmance with willow*
#bbcan3
@BigBrotherCA thought that we wouldn't notice a have not drinking alcohol 
I don't think she was punished I think @BigBrotherCA  thought that the live feeders would be to stupid to notice 
@KraziliaLove #@BigBrotherCA gave Sarah bottle of champagne so that her an Willow can go on a date.
I wish Brittnee wasn't mixed up with Sarah and her pet Willow  #BBCAN3
But Big Brother gave her the alcohol. They themselves are showing a double standard 
Willow and Sarah  #BBCAN3 
No they are not! And I'm sure production would have turned them down. @BigBrotherCA is push an agenda with this 
Except they mean it...I think these two wanna be a real thing<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 
Yes exactly. This is all garbage  
@BigBrotherCA has hit an all time low this Sarah and Willow stuff is crap. #BBCAN3
But Willow behaves as though she is a toddler, all the time . She clearly has issues  
What's no! 
Sarah and Willow are so gross  #BBCAN3
Lol ok!! 
But what did the house get rewarded with? 
Oh <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>ok thanks  
Ok! Well tell me! Lol 
I just got in from work so I have no idea! 
Uuummmm are you asking???? 

#nocomment

#bbcan3
But Willow is so dumb she will take that back to Zach and Britt would be screwed  
"Maybe I'll just shower" really Sarah !! What an innovative concept ! #BBCAN3
Sorry Sarah you calling yourself Danielle is an insult to her....cus you're gross. #BBCAN3

Britt should have put up Ebola next to Johnny when she was HOH 
She should have!!! 
I suspect Willow will be crying in Sarah's arms all night over this fart filled interaction with Zach  #BBCAN3
Zach and Willow are more awkward than Kev and SARS  #BBCAN3
Uuummmm... Willow and sexy ??!! #BBCAN3 HELL NAH!!! 
????? 
@BBUSFan101 oh ya! I forgot!
@BBUSFan101 was Bobby HOH week 1 ?
Was Boobies HOH?! 
Yes but !! an HG who competed to win an HOH, wins it gains power then complains about being HOH ?! Who does that?! 
#BBCAN3
Pimple is the first person I've ever heard complain about being HOH!!! #BBCAN3
Lol !!!! Yes that is true! 
When did you say??? 
Called what? 
Uuummmm..... Ya! 
I hope Britt is finally off of Ashleigh's radar! #BBCAN3

The fan feed idea is a fail @BigBrotherCA  
But how often are they around the pool. No matter the room they would all be empty at some point 
Lol yes! But any room we vote for would eventually be empty, but why have 4 feeds on one set of people ? 
4 feeds of awkward talk between Kevin and Sarah or!!! A shot of an empty bath room in the fan feed epic fail @BigBrotherCA #BBCAN3
Why are all 4 feeds on Sarah and Kevin? #BBCAN3
Chickens....heads....off 
Uummmm what's going on with Bruno and Bobby?! #BBCAN3
Don't eve thing the Toronto Raptors bothered to try in this game 4! SMDH!!! #bbcan3
@theikawong what would of have done if Pampers was a HG in your season ?
Well I guess he did it in a way that she believed it was her idea. None the less the out come you should be pleased  
@BBUSFan101 you don't mind to see Britt or Sarah go, so what was frustrating you about Kev not doing anything? What did you want him to do?
I know you were, but as you can see he admitted to purposely deflecting her from game talk cus her head would blow ! 
But he kinda is, him, Ash and Zach  

Pilar: Yeah?

Me: You stupid. #bbcan3
Stupid is a complement!  
That is actually a pretty good strategy I'm just sorry Britt had to be affected by it  #BBCAN3
Soooo you've been making sexy with your brother ??? Pili??? #BBCAN3

She never said she is but I never felt she ever had Britt's back  , so I never fully trust her! So I'm cautious  
What ?  
I don't trust SARS though so  
But it seems like SARS is winning Gollum over more and wants to go to Bruno and Godfrey to go up agains the 4

We will see Wednesday can't come fast enough 
Doubt that Britt has no one who has her back 
SARS and her girl interrupted would vote out Britt easily  
Of course SARS will vote out Britt she was never loyal to her to begin with!!! 
Uuggghhhhh!!!!! 
What house is he in??? That doesn't even make sense this group is pissing me off so badly!!!! 
Why what did he say? 
They don't know self worth 
That's what I sound like when Sarah and Willow come on my screen so I feel you!

Well when she was in the HNR this morning she was so angry about being nominated and you can see the fire under eyes 
Pipi long stockings please don't use words like logic...it's most unnatural for you  #BBCAN3
Anyone else but Britt and Godfrey I hope !!! 
Britt for sure and I guess that leaves Sarah but doesn't mean she will be on slop 
Willow is gross in every way  #BBCAN3
@kokeytakokez so the next time they want to make sure she doesn't go on it so what about Britt? Or Godfrey ?!!
Sigh!!!!! I'm so irritated with this group! Ash and Pili feel so sorry that Sarah is on slop again 
Well I haven't watched it too much today, had to work but this morning it was still Sindy 
Wow and I guess Britt deserves to be on it again?!... Those two need to go! 
What could Britt and Zach be talking about for this long? #BBCAN3
All this boy talk about UFC or whatever <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE> #BBCAN3

Hhhaaaahhhaaaa!!! @KraziliaLove I CAN'T WITH IS ANY MORE!!! I JUST CAN'T!!!! 
At least she is not going down without a fight ! Hope it works! 
Truthfully I would vote for Pilar over Ash. Ash has a nasty personality. She's unkind. Pilar is honest and kind

Try harder dude! Try harder! 
Clearly you need to find a way into that BB house cus Kevin obviously isn't helping her! 
Pilar just asked Godfrey "who were you up against" referring to him being on the block last week with...JP ...wow Was she even there #bbcan3
Not Britt, it was Willow in the HOH bed with Zach and ash! That's who Godfrey was referring to  
Sigh......

What planet are you currently occupying ?! SARS won't do what?! Did you now start to watch dis show ?! 
Wooh!!!! Ease up!!!! I just like HBO and want to encourage Britt. Godfrey. Ika, Topaz and Gary to enjoy it too! 
You are  giving the goblins way too much credit  
No I'm saying Game of Thrones is a damn good show and they should watch it  
It's clear 
This is the only way Brittnee and Godfrey would ever be safe in the BB House #justsaying #BBCAN3 
Pimple !!! Put up Brittnee I dare you !!!#BBCAN3 
If I was in the BB house! I'd be like #BBCAN3 
@BBUSFan101 
@BBUSFan101 I'll watch cus you said to 
Sindy girl you tried .....It just didn't work!...#BBCAN3 
I'll need alcohol for that one  
@BBUSFan101 I'll leave all that fancy hoping up to you. 
True but it won't happen.....ever  
But you have Kevyn wevy as your avi <CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>

<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE>

Upset and you're laughing at me!!!! Stop it !!! 
I'm so pissed!! I wanna go into the BB house and kick somebody in the eye! #bbcan3 
They clearly need to make a black Big Brother! Cus u watched Ika, topaz and Gary get targeted there I said it  
They have SARS and Gollum !!! And Bobby BUT no!!!!!! If it's not Godfrey it's Britt.  
I just want her to leave Britt the hell alone...I'm tired of seeing Britt always getting targeted  
If Britt makes it through eviction she has NO option other than win HOH!! 
Me: You know good and well you had no intentions of winning. lol 

#bbcan3
That's what I want!!! But for some reason line every damn season... Only certain people are targeted no matter what 

goodnight. #bbcan3 
 
Hasn't she already??? I just wish Britt could see that!! 
Sarah is full of shit 
And I love how Britt's closest ally Sarah was there to comfort her...ya right! 
So I'm guessing Britt is all by herself feeling down in he HNR! Such crap is going on in the house! #BBCAN3
I'm annoyed by Ashleigh period! 
Pili is so being managed by Ash and Zach, Kev is useless  #BBCAN3
I cannot stand Sarah and I hope she goes up it would be a dream come true if she gets evicted over Sindy  
Considering Pili wants to put up Britt 
Hhhmmmm.... 
I don't believe that , cus k know she is still gunning for Britt because she Larkin her territory<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE> 
At least not for this week! 

Pilar crossed that line and walked another 2 ‚Ä¶
Yup!!!! That's how it seems to go!! Always!!! 
Well at least Godfrey won the POV!!! But I don't want Brittnee going up!! Why can't she put up Sarah instead??! I don't understand? #BBCAN3
Hhhaaahhhaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!! 
I am not ashamed...I was pathetic before #BBCAN3 and I will be pathetic afterwards!<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>

Washington Wizards have completely shut down the Toronto Raptors 3-0 There's no coming back from this Uuuggghhh!!!!game 4 pointless  #BBCAN3
Toronto Raptors game is stressing me out AND!!!! There are no live feeds!!!! #BBCAN3 
Wow!!! That's a whole lot of goings ons!! Lol !!!! 
For least is a tie between Willow and Sarah for favourite is Brittnee, Godfrey is a very close secound  
BBCan3 Goes Triple Noms &amp; Double Evictions

Toronto Raptors are so frustrating on this first round of NBA Playoffs!!! #BBCAN3
People are only throwing shade at @alsopeterbrown don't know why?! He only speaks the truth! #BBCAN3
#BBCAN3
I'd be happy to see Willow, Sarah and Bobby go  
But Ash is only interested in going after Britt and if Godfrey stays Zach will go after him  
Ooo!!!! John Snow may have a chance to become John Stark of Winterfeld awesome!!!!
So very! Very! True!!!! 
Yes the table of invisibility, what?! Doesn't everyone have one?!

No Sarah Ash winning HOH and Pili winning is not the same for Britt . Cus Pili wasn't coming after her. Ash was over Zach. Her man #BBCAN3
I guess I was right about the how certain people ended up being HN's #BBCAN3
Sigh!!!!! ....epic sigh!!!! 
Yes!!! Thank you!!!! 
Where Sindy went wrong is she over estimated Pili and Kev #BBCAN3
Lol  
Kev and pili Ugghhh!!!! 
AMEN!!! If this was BBUK or BBAUS they would  
Bobby and Zach laughing at the fact that they were able to make Pili's choice for her cus she doesn't know what she's doing #BBCAN3
Who you Godfrey ? 
@BBUSFan101 but I noticed since yesterday Britt never tried to talk game with her only be kind and always hugging her unlike everyone else
@BBUSFan101 pili didn't slur she spoke in  sentences and Britt was really encouraging to her about her future it was nice
Lol!!! I'm off today! Back to work tomorrow! Pili and Britt talking about school and getting on the show and life 
But who? Willow they won't maybe Bobby that would be good 
It's true, but only because of Godfrey I don't want her saved cus he may go home.  
This is the most articulate I have heard Pilar speak. Her convo with Britt is nice #BBCAN3
Out of all the girls including Ash. Britt speaks with Pili and not at her. She makes her feel comfortable and they relate well#bbcan3
@kokeytakokez she agreed with Bobby the Sindy 2nd go she came in too strong and Sarah said ya that's why I'm separating myself from her
@kokeytakokez and the thing is its Sindy that's nominated not even Sarah and she still throwing her under the bus
@kokeytakokez you watching the feeds it seems like Sarah is bad mouthing Sindy to Bobby in the HNR this is why I can't stand Sarah
Yes so true!!! That would be ideal but we are dealing with a toddler 
As long as it's not Britt or Bruno I don't really care. But u know that's wishful thinking. 
I hope Godfrey wins the veto! #BBCAN3

Britt 
So pumpkin head is opting to sleep in the main bedroom.....sigh!!! This week's HOH is a joke #BBCAN3 
Oh wait you mean SARS licking the girls faces ??! Good damn question! 
Letting who what? And who is her? 
Gollum (Willow) please stop talking ! Please!!! #BBCAN3
What a waste of an HOH this week! 
I am proud  to say I voted for Pili to go over Risha! 
Uuummmm..... No<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 
Godfrey 's level of confidence !!! #BBCAN3 
Godfrey just said why in the hell would it be 5-4 for him?  Meaning JP!!!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>I love Godfrey!! #BBCAN3
I'm surprised Godfrey isn't sleeping considering a the laps he ran around  Porcupine  on their convo earlier!!!! #BBCAN3
Pinut brain!!!! This nick name takes the win!!!!  #BBCAN3  
Kevin allowed them to influence her and it's Zach and Ash who told Pili to put up Godfrey and Sindy it was her idea 
And Popcorn spilled all the secrets Sindy told her and Kevin never stopped her  
Ya once the other side realized Sindy was in the HOH Zach and Ash went in to do damage control  
Finally intelligent convo. We were deprived of that all day! Love Godfrey and Bruno! #BBCAN3
But they went to him this morning and he did nothing. Accept went back to Zach with the info him and pumpkin  
Wow! HNR is popular tonight !!  #BBCAN3
I guess Ash is there to keep an eye on Gollum....I mean Willow! #BBCAN3
Exactly !!! 
So why did Ash go into the HNR??? #BBCAN3
But did Kevin go into the HNR to spy and carry back info to Zach ? #BBCAN3
Nope!!! LMAO I've been there for a week and nothing !!! 
Reaching the platinum level seems very anticlimactic, nothing happens when you get there! Everything just stops! #BBCAN3
SARS and weeping willow's convos are annoying ... So I assume since its hard to hear most of them #BBCAN3
Where does Willow have her hand?! #BBCAN3 
#B‚Ä¶
She"s hella gross she don't bathe either!!! Remember when Godfrey was roasting her and he said she stinks  
Why does Sarah only wanna be licking up all dem girl faces so?! She doesn't even brush her teeth!!!! #BBCAN3
She's strategic ???? Like hell  she is!!!! 
She's smart??? Ok ! So how any minutes did she say was in 3 hours??? 
Well I did say she is pretty! She has that going for her.....at least 
The one that she slurs out of!...uummmm wait! The one they are allowed to show on the live feeds !!<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE>

And it seems my app isn't working any more I think it got sick of me!

Ash never used the "N" word on Godfrey it was one of her fans apparently. 
She can't multi task. 
 #BBCAN3  #psych101
Funny enough!!! I think the Ashleigh alliance is thinking this themselves Unspoken racism in Canada #BBCAN3  
This reminds me of Pilli and her alliance ...but I don't know why??? #BBCAN3 
Godfrey is gonna walk away from this convo with Pili like  #BBCAN3 

(This is a joke so you don't have to run and comment on how strategi‚Ä¶
After this convo with Godfrey Pillow will be like #BBCAN3 
Godfrey just ran circles around region of peel !!! She has no idea how any insults he just hit her with ! #BBCAN3

 #BBCAN3
@BBUSFan101 are willing to admit Pilar is not as good as you hoped she'd be in this game?? Cus she sucks!!!#BBCAN3
Fire the head of casting  before next season!!!! 
Who ever casted Pilar should be fired #justsaying @BigBrotherCA #sorry #notsorry you had one job!!! #BBCAN3
That showmance is the only think pili and Kevin are good for #BBCAN3
So ridiculous! A complete waste of an HOH 
Why isn't Kevin guiding plli??? Clearly she needs his brain power! #BBCAN3
I can't listen to that "game talk" between Sindy and Pili....it's so frustrating! #BBCAN3
#ReasonsToLive #GodfreyForHOH #TeamGod #TeamGodfrey #BBCAN3 
Exactly !!!!! 
Oh Pilar.... #BBCAN3 
Hey Pili...FYI  #BBCAN3 
Pili is apologizing to Ash cus she believed Sindy over her...really Pilli...really!! Zach and Ash are playing you..puppet! #BBCAN3
@DonnaMay5 and poor little Pili is over whelmed cus people keep talking to her in the HOH room...imagine that<NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>#BBCAN3
Even though Ash admitted to them that Sindy told them the truth about the CS ash said Sindy can't be trusted 
It see the CS is convincing  kev  and Pili to go after the other side of the house 
Exactly !!!!!!#BBCAN3  
Such hard work ....hope she didn't injure herself. #BBCan3  
Pili probably thought she was competing for an over night pass in the honeymoon suite with the Bachelor Canada! Hence her confusion! #BBCAN3
Oh wow!!! That rainy scene by the hot tub...Kevin and Pilar!!!<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><HEART WITH RIBBON><HEART WITH RIBBON><HEART WITH RIBBON><HEART WITH RIBBON>wow!!!! #BBCAN3

Sindy is showing such patience a talking to Pili...I would have snapped by now  #BBCAN3
Pili seems so useless right now! It's frustrating to watch Sindy try and talk to her about the CS #BBCAN3

Newport sucked!‚Ä¶
That's her alliance so it wouldn't make sense for her, but Pili has no real enemies  so her HOH is not hers 
@JakxxMonroe and then they get pissed at others when things don't go their way!zach is pathetic #BBCAN3
YES!!!!!!!!!!! They want a certain result without actually putting in the work #bbcan3 
Truer words have never been spoken!!!!! #bbcan3 
I always get giggly when Bruno mentions his Trini friend!!! #bbcan3
You know your life is empty when you have nothing else to do but attack people in the middle of the night on Twitter 
This is the crap people tweeting at this flickin hour @kokeytakokez good thing I'm in a good mood! 
#bbcan3 some people need to hear this truth! 
Exactly !!!!! I hope it will happen! 
Well I guess all that talk got him another week in the house. If you don't like it tough! #BBCAN3  
Zach told Pili leave Godfrey in the game, cus he will deal with him head to head, ya ok Zach!! #BBCAN3 
I think from now on Big Brother needs to have an interpreter in the BB house! #BBCAN3
Oh shut up Zach! You suck at this game ! #BBCAN3
the HOH competition was NOT saying a complete sentence.
