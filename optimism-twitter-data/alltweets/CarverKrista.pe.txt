My boyfriend has had @adamlevine's song 'sugar' on repeat in the bathroom for 20 minutes in a row, I'm concerned.
I will forever love this pic of my brother and I <CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
It's hard to go from 24/7 with your child to basically 4 hours.. makes me wanna wake her up and cuddle right now lol

But I came home to a clean house and dinner <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ Seth is awesome
I was in a room full of crying babies for 8 hours today <GRIMACING FACE>

Hate when Seth's gone all week for work because I can't go to the gym and then ordering pizza temptation takes over.
Hoping she starts acting more like herself this afternoon!
Having a sick baby is probably the scariest thing ever, because you can't do anything about it.
Gracie Is being so lethargic and it freaks me out, she didn't wake up till 10:30 and then she just layed on me till I made her eat <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

Seth and I always get each other useful gifts. Jewelry's great and all but how about this new phone and computer. Lol
I've been really happy lately, and extremely tired due the fact that I've been running 2-7 miles a night and then having weird dreams.
See Seth has no choice because I koala bear him when he walks in from work and then we hug for a good 47 seconds lol
One important thing to do once you have kids is to make time for your relationship.

When @molliegrace21 screenshots my embarrassing snapchat <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
I'm walking with a limp at 21, this is not right. Lol
I need a hip replacement. Idk what happened but I'm about to be the next person on the"help I've fallen and can't get up"commercial.
Checked on Gracie, turns out she peed through her diaper and pj pants. Lol 10 ounces did her in before bed.
Inappropriate, yet funny. 
I used to think I could never live alone but it's not that bad being all alone, it has its perks.
Home alone with the baby until Wednesday night. Soooo who wants to stay and bake lots of cookies and watch movies..
Going through Gracie's baby clothes and it's so hard to depart with them.
#thestruggle
I would get a job butttt I don't wanna pay for daycare it's outrageous.
So many things I want right now.. It makes me almost want to get a job. . . Almost

My dinner was green beans and applesauce.. And a lot of water. I don't even know who I am anymore lol

Rule número uno: don't make me go to bed alone. I hate that. It's annoying. I'm important. Hi. Hormonal. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
My baby is so tan compared to well everyone!
It's 2 am and Gracie started crying so I went in her room for the 4th time tonight and I see her sleeping like this.. 
Wine makes me emotional.. Seth asked me if we were getting Mexican and I teared up out of happiness <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #icanteven
Gracie is teething hardcore <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I forgot what it's like to get up with a crying baby.
Drinking wine and singing shrek songs all by myself on the couch #thelife
Anytime Gracelynn stays the night at her grandma and grandpas I am always wishing she was home in my arms<LOUDLY CRYING FACE> miss my baby&amp;it's only been 6hrs.
Tbt she's so big now! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Seth's mom texts us to remind us to water our Christmas tree lol gotta love her <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
This glass of wine isn't making my emotions any better either <NEUTRAL FACE>
Some women would give anything to get their baby back and it's just sad to think some women just get rid of theirs before it's born <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
After reading an article on women losing their babies at childbirth I'm in tears knowing people think it's okay to kill an unborn child.
Made $70 and 2 bottles of wine for working 4 hours today <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@TorieHouston lol you're telling me!!
@TorieHouston our wedding is going to be huge, I can't wait. Also, it's in the near future but he "is doing it when I least expect it" lol

I should probably apply for a job. Anyone know anywhere in Sullivan that is hiring?!
Finally awake! <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

I'm in the bath and Seth's on the couch and texting me about our electric bill.. #marriedlife

Ain't got time to hear stupid shit like that.
Chances are if you always talk about how "fat" you are when you're around me even though you're skinny,I will limit my time spent with you.
Anyone wanna bring me food. Haven't ate anything today.

Seth put a plastic bowl in the oven and it melted. He's a dumbass.
I'm busy everyday of the week and it's stressful as shit. I'm gonna have grey hair soon.
Why is this world built around getting a college education that takes years and too much money so we can get a job and have to pay our debt.
I've been lecturing Seth about chewing since my class got out.. He's going to hate me becoming a nurse. Lol
My 2 hour lecture was over cancer this morning #depressing
Doing my homework 30 min before class because #momproblems #tired #sos
@meganmariecarv1 what!?
Played cat and mouse with Gracie then let her take all her clothes out of her drawers and put them back in. Now she's asleep and I'm bored!
@meganmariecarv1 bring food
Really in the mood to drive and listen to music, except not alone. So basically that plan is out the window.
Insomnia
The way she's talking is making me LOL.. This guy in my class just told her she's fucking crazy. She then threatened to cut him.
This girl in my class is talking psycho about some freshman girl that's flirting with her bf.. She said he's "her property" lol
Woo I'm rich, now I wanna skip class and go shopping.. Hmm
@lawyer3578 yum!
Seine eat Mexican with me!
We are so far ahead in our rent that we will be paying Decembers rent in October.. #goodrenters
Gracelynn is so big and it makes me so sad. She needs to stop growing, this momma is not ready for her to get big <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Also my now 2nd boss said "I like my women tall" today .. Creeped out to the maximum.

Class, then spending my day with @macy_wrn Seth and @anderton20 going to the apple orchard and who knows what else :)
Dec 5th will determine my future. Just thinking about it gives me butterflies in my stomach.
Probably cus he wants to be able to justify eating whatever he wants.
Seth has baby fever <FLUSHED FACE><GRIMACING FACE>
@macy_wrn @anderton20 I work <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE> let's go somewhere Wednesday!! I shall text u!

Gracelynn is so vocal this morning, and I'm so tired <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><SLEEPING FACE>

Downfall of that is that she won't go to sleep now.. Eh worth it
Woke Gracie up at 1 am just to come cuddle with me because she looks lonely in her own bed and way to cute to not cuddle!
People would choose an altered state of consciousness that’s toxic&amp;destroys most aspects of normal life bc for a brief moment you feel okay.
Me"ok is she pregnant or is she not"
Jordan"the world may never know" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> make up your mind
@haurenlarris thank you!
@haurenlarris did Jordan leave her phone at home!?
@becca2292 ok so I exaggerated slightly.. We should do something tomorrow night if you're freeeee
I also got called @jbboyerr today too lololol
One of my female residents said today "I enjoy looking at you, you're pretty to look at"
Only good thing about today was Seth's moms banana and choc chip bread and Gracie started crawling!
Today was shitty emphasizing that word because I'm a cna.
I spend most of my time thinking in the bath tub because that's the only Alone time I get.
When I was little I was always like "mom why don't you have friends to play with" .. Grew up had a baby and am like oh i see now.
Realizing I haven't seen any of my friends in over two weeks.. Is this what growing up is cus I'm over it. I need friends.
When someone replays your snap <EYES>
Work night from hell
My landlords are amazing #thankgod <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

I already got "your baby is so tan"
Gracie and I are at LLC.. Starting her early #lol

Anyone wanna come kidnap me and make me do something other than stay in this house when it's 86 degrees in here.
I have an attitude from hell today.
Being on a college campus is so weird to me.
So hot I'm dying
@MollyDyer1 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Seth is the same way!
@becca2292 will do! :)
@becca2292 coming to u! I gotta go to good ole LLC around 2!
@becca2292 might take u up on that tomorrow night!
But really. This is the absolute worst. I'd rather be working a double at work than trying to sleep here.
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air can't live can't breathe with no air <DIZZY FACE>
Also we have 2 windows located at the front of our apartment.. However that does nothing cus our place is 1600 sq feet.
Our air broke, it's 85 degrees in here and Seth thinks that it's okay.
Time management! That's all I have to say <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Gracie loves Winnie the Pooh in the mornings <TWO HEARTS>

Seth-"this is so boring omg I wanna do something fun" "krista you're such a nazi" "look I hung up 1shirt" <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>

Gracelynn is so happy this morning, And I am just soooo tired.
You have to step outside of the person you’ve been. And remember the person you were meant to be.The person u wanted to be.The person u are.
Happiness is not a destination that you should strive to get to.. It's just a feeling.
The person you were years ago didn’t imagine the person you are today.

I could use some adult interaction, I've been talking to a baby and my animals all day and it's goin on 8:30 now..
I could eat subway right now <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
The fact that I don't want to cook food and make more dishes outweighs the hunger right now.
When you stay in the house all week you start to get a little bit cray.. Ugh
The worst part about napping is that by the time you almost get to sleep the baby wakes up.. So then you feel like you're draggin'
Forever wishing I could take a nap longer than 45 minutes.. So tired.
Day 2 screaming baby.. Running on E.. Can't clean cook or shower #justbreathe

I don’t think that you truly love someone until your willing to give up anything&amp;everything to be with them.
Went to the doc for myself and the nurses snatched Gracelynn during my entire appointment lol they love her.
@mannlisa make foooood and they will come #noahsark
Now is that time.
No matter how old you get there's times when you still just want your mom.

Don't try to save someone that is in self destruction, you will only bring yourself and others down with you.
I have always said "why me" and my mom has always said "because it could be worse, it could be someone that is not as strong as you are"
I wish I didn't let things that are out of my control get to me.
While crying over the phone to my mom

When Seth is gone I let rayna sleep in the bed with us cus it's scary lol even though she's a chicken herself it makes me feel better.
Watching Gracelynn sleep is so peaceful.
It's so hard to live my everyday life without worrying, I'm sick of feeling like this <PENSIVE FACE>
Denial, most simply defined, is when you reject a painful truth, even when there is overwhelming evidence in front of you.
Seriously so aggravated and there's nothing I can even do about it!
Heroin is the devil
Just snap chatted Seth's ass.. You're welcome if you got that snap #bubblebutt
She's so cute <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> love my baby girl! 
Been laying in bed for the past hour trying to doze back off while Gracelynn keeps kicking me lol ugh so tired but she wants to play <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I shouldn't be allowed to be on social media when I'm pissy/hormonal.
At a loss of words, sucks to see someone you love choose the worst possible thing over everyone that cares about them.

I think my dreams are trying to tell me something.
Gracie slept for 7 hours! I love her so much!
My mind says work out but my body is screaming go on without me #tootired
Was burping the baby and it sounded like she threw up on me.. I said "April fools or nah?" .. Nah
I told Seth I was gonna April fools day him with hey I'm pregnant again and he said-"jokes on you, I want another baby"<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
You're one to talk
I hate being up this late because all I wanna do is eat food out of boredom.
@4everMkd she has a little cold right now other than that she's great and thanks!
@dulceylane I got mine the last month. But it's worth it and yeah when you're with someone who doesn't care at all it makes it better.
@dulceylane when it's all over with you'll feel like a whole new woman I promise! I feel great minus the damn stretch marks.
@dulceylane no I eat normal now, I try earring healthy stuff too and lots of chicken since it's lean. Breast feeding for a week or 2 helps!
@4everMkd it's hard for sure, everyday is a struggle even now getting hardly any sleep but it's all worth it in the end <PURPLE HEART>
@4everMkd it sucked, lol it's okay I don't mind!
@dulceylane also, I lost all my baby weight at 5-6 weeks post pregnancy and 18 of it after delivery.
@dulceylane that's how I was! Put it all on at the end. My total weight gain was 28 pounds which is good compared to most first timers!
@dulceylane toward the end of my pregnancy there was a point when I literally got so hungry &amp; gained baby weight finally.
@dulceylane yes! Actually the first week I pry are once a day, I was so busy with the baby I didn't even get hungry.
@4everMkd oh I did, but not right away. Once you get it you're bed ridden and that sucked.
@4everMkd lol ya it's like cramps but crazy bad where you puke from pain.
@4everMkd oh I promise it's worse
My mom just added me on snapchat.. Lol

Gracelynn just told me happy St. Pattys Day.. View with caution!! 
Baby won't sleep when I put her down.. The struggle is so real right now.
@heatherlynn92 no kidding we would have a zoo going at our house!

My mom just referred to a girl as a douche bag lol
@4everMkd thanks!! I've been trying, it feels great to see progress :)
New phone selfie!

Currently have 2 phones since I haven't switched my number to my new phone, this crap is annoying!
@abigailLt92 that's what I'm sayin!
Someone go eat Mexican with me!!
So bored , need friends.
Seth and Gracelynn are the best thing that's ever happened to me. I am truly blessed and I thank god for my beautiful family every night.
Seth bought me a hot pink iPhone 5C today #happygirl #lovemyboyfriend
@4everMkd lol he was stalking her with his gf
@4everMkd lets just say he's worse than her I'm sure.
Props to my sister for being one tough cookie, breaking her hand on your head was well worth it <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Any man that puts his hand on a woman is a fuckin Coward! You better pray my dad doesn't find you before I do!
My mom just admitted that she has a fake twitter account an she follows me and has for awhile..This goes to show you how sneaky parents are!
@SethGrason haha <FACE THROWING A KISS>
When you have a baby a lot of things change but your life doesn't get put on hold.
Oh my gosh Gracelynn grabs everything now, especially my hair #ow
That my rant for the day. Lol
And most of the time people who talk crap about it don't even have children so they have no Idea, u can't by lookin in from the outside.
I see way to many people harping on parents for going out, yet they're not going to say shit if the parents "go out" to dinner &amp; a movie.
It's healthy to get time away from your kids and maintain a social life with friends and or your significant other.
Something creepy is going on here and I don't like it!
@SethGrason literally freaking out currently
Sitting in the bedroom feeding gracelynn.. I hear a baby crying out in my living room, get up and there's nobody else here wtf just happened
@SethGrason no I was laying down right next to her when I took it!
Okay if you zoom in on the pic I just posted it looks like there's someone in the mirror on the bed with us #hellno
She always Does this.. Even in the womb when we went for ultrasounds she covered her face lol 
It feels like I'm sorta drowning. Like there's fluid in my lungs and every time I cough I just wake up gracelynn ugh
If you haven't watched @jbboyerr's snapchat story you're missing out!!! #sofunny #dyingoflaughter #foxpoop
I want food that someone else cooks and doesn't make dishes that I have to do, ya feel me?
Ameren just shit on my day #GoingAmish

I could never work 1st shift and do this baby business.. More power to the moms that do!
Downing the robitussin dm now if only gracelynn would sleep longer than an hour at a time..
Still trying to figure out how to get up all night with a baby and try to function the next day, add being sick into that and you get death<ASTONISHED FACE>
The bed is too hot to sleep in, tonight it's me and the couch, and probs the baby.
Sometimes you just do stuff bc you have no choice, like burning up with a fever yet up with your baby at 1 am.

The problem for most people when it comes to commitment is the fear of losing the ability to have sex with multiple people #truth #society
We all have friends crippled by the fear of change, refusing to leave an obviously failing relationship.
Being sick and taking care of a baby is detrimental to my well being <ASTONISHED FACE>
@SethGrason yesssss!
@SethGrason probs sept <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Gracie slept with one eye open all night aka didn't sleep worth shit. Lol where's my sister when I need her.
