@DrStevePerry :our children are in #crisismode
Great event today celebrating "moms" 
Happy national teachers day!! We are proud of you all
Happy Monday! Let's be optimistic

After a very challenging week, #triumphant
One of my students who is 8yrs old beat me, not once but twice in tic-tac-toe. How about that?
Happy Friday!!!  Hoping for a great end to your day
Quite a difference a day makes
Good morning Monday
@JEstevezWFTV very nice tie
Thought for the weekend 
#health tip for the day 
Earth day activity 
Can't get our students to enjoy hot cereals; oatmeal is a loser
Lovely end to our day
Wet roads. Be careful to &amp; fro #orlando
Happy Monday !! 
Storm threats on Channel 9 now. #wftv 
@WFTV : very sad
It's another week of ECE. Here's to a wonderful week
Enjoy your weekend! Make it a family affair
So thankful for a wonderful ending to a very challenging week
Hope your Friday is off to a great start
Take time, make time for your children
Everything that could go wrong did not today#thankful
Well done!! The end of another busy week
A parent just advised me that she does not want her child eating meat today.Well! Thankfully we're serving tuna casserole.
Yes! We are open for business tomorrow
We had a surprise inspection today, nerve racking but, we did good
Welcome!! 
Happy Tuesday!!
Good morning Monday people.

Tough day today! Everything that could wrong did
Happy Thursday!! It's been very busy week #springbreak school-age students are very active
Thank you @OrlandoMagic @CommunityLeak for the bags with books. Our students and parents are very grateful 
Spring break has arrived <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Too much is never enough when it comes to keeping kids safe
The end of a very busy day
Getting breakfast ready; cheese biscuit, applesauce, 1%milk #childcare
Get up! Be pumped! It's "early-day".
Here we go, Happy Monday!!
Happy weekend everyone! Take time to relax and exhale
Weary day, but certainly worth it
Children can light up your day
Happy Wednesday!! Stick together
Such a sad and distorted reality #childrenincrisis
They don't think that their child has any issue. Most students who fight says" my mom says to hit my friends if they hit me".
I do my part informing the parents, asking them for ways in which we can help those children. Surprisingly enough, most parents have no clue
As an #earlychildhoodeducator I have seen my share of young children who have behavior issues, as young as 2yrs old. That's concerning to me
Great end to a busy week
Happy Friday! Let's end the week on the right track
"The more we deny the reality of now, the more difficult it will be to resolve the bitter truth tomorrow" ~barefooted-words
Good morning! Happy Tuesday
Children need you NOW, not when they become adults. By then it would have been "a bit too late", says every adult child
Let your child know that you care what they do and what happens to them
Happy weekend 
"Picture day" was a success 
Wet roads!!! Be careful! #Orlando
Happy Thursday!! Preparing for the final day of "picture day"
Day 1 of picture day went pretty smooth
Here we go ...."Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.....the days of the week"
One of my students told me today: " I left my thoughts at home,I'll get it when I go home". He is only 4yrs old.
Should parents encourage 4-12 yrs old #children to fight back? I have parents who do and I can't get them to understand that they shouldn't.
Thankful for a great week
Bundle up ! 
Artist! 4 yrs old drew this all on his own. #Brilliant!! 
Priceless #very young male bonding, planning &amp; working together 
Hope everyone is staying warm and cozy

Are there any support system in place for parents of children with special needs?#Orlando
So many parents are going through the very emotional task of accepting the reality of their child being diagnosed with special needs
@HOLAcademy: Just one of those days today, thankfully there's the weekend to re-coup

Enjoy your weekend and shopping spree

When you truly love working with children, your problems or worries goes from 10-0 in an instance. They make it all go away
The highlight of my day is to have every parent retrieve their child safe and sound at the end of the day.
Asked a 7yrs old  does he need any help with his homework, he replied " no, I got this".  WELL!!
Good morning! Hey it's Tuesday!
Happy Monday friends! I dare you to have a great day
The truth be told, we can give all of our best to children, ultimately the parents play a much bigger role
Too many parents are expecting teachers to work a miracle with their children's education when they need to stay involve and nurture them
@BShieldsWFTV : woke up to this! Looks like a scene from a spooky movie.
Good morning! Did you know that children can help you around the house? As early as 4 yrs old, they can learn responsibility.

Hope everyone is having a great weekend.
@josedneirah : por favor!! Stop by HOLA
Parents need to, and must make time to nurture their children. Help them with homework. They are the first and most important teachers
Hope you all are having a fine day.
Good morning! Happy Tuesday!

Happy Sunday!Get your kids involved in your plans for the day.They need the training &amp; experience of family time,especially the younger ones
Early childhood must be appreciated! 
On the other hand we are very dishearten when we come across the parents ( not going to name them) or simply DON'T HAVE A CLUE!
They are always eager to compliment &amp; understand us. Ushering kind, words, a smile, and positive gestures to us. For that We " THANK YOU!
We all know how challenging our efforts are in early childhood. It is very comforting to know that we have the support of PARENTS.

As educators, teachers, our first priority is to keep all the children in our care safe! It is a priority to us!! #proudoftheheroicteachers
This horrible incident hits very hard. It brings back memories of a few years ago,@nena28bx @borichika @jneira86 @josedneirah #thankful
We pray that the Lord will keep his promise and comfort those who are mourning.
The looks on their faces said it all. # parent'sworsenightmare

Do you think children should be encouraged to celebrate Halloween?  Yet they are not encouraged to watch movies like Passion of Christ#hmm
Against all odds, love and protect your children. Teach them good values and some tough love(discipline ) when necessary. Educate them!
People who harm children should never be given a second chance
Don't see how people can interfere and disrupt the lives of children when all they do is bring joy and sense to life
One of them asked me. I said "My mom is taking me home" One girl asked me" You got a mama ?" #funnykids
Interacting with 4yrs old. One of them said" After school my mama is taking me to MCDonald". Another said" I'm going to ChuckyCheese" Then

I see children isolate themselves from other  children due to the medications that (are not effective ) they are taking. #childrenindistress
They don't give the kids a chance. Teachers in public schools are not properly trained for the challenges of educating children in distress
99% of the diagnostics are made from the time children attend public school at a very early age at that. No other school does that.#negative
Too many people are going around diagnosing children, placing a stamp on them, labeling and drugging  them off to nowhere.Where is the help?
One of our VPK students is living in a shelter with his family.His story is one of the many sad stories. Children are in distress.

Happy Sunday! 
The price of children not receiving attention from their parents or spending quality time together is so profound. There is no make up!!!
Weekends and holidays are for making a family connection not Valentines day. Children are important, and they deserve quality time.
Happy weekend! Whatever your plans, include your family and let the children in on what "labor day" means
Wow! Redirecting one of my VPK students from an inappropriate behavior , he told "shut up! I gone freak your face"! Well!!
