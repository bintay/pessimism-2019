#Prop34 may not have passed, but the movement to end the #deathpenalty will still continue, stronger than ever.

Mixed feelings about the CA Prop Results: #Yeson30, #Noon32, #Noon34, #Yeson35, #Yeson36, #Noon37, #Yeson39
With 100% of the precincts reporting, California's #Prop34 fails with 52.8% No and 47.2% Yes. #deathpenalty
@JessWehby Thank you!! That's kind of you. More #humanrights work to be done. #endthedeathpenalty
Sleep deprived, emotionally exhausted... realizing that there's so much more work to be done.
With 98.5% of the precincts reporting in, #Prop34 trails behind: 52.7% No, 47.3% Yes.
I fell asleep watching the results and just woke up from a dream about the propositions.
@SFdirewolf It failed really narrowly--51.56% No, 48.44% Yes on #MeasureS #berkeley
@SFdirewolf @MarthaBridegam Actually, Measure S failed: 
@meredithkayw Too early to tell but... doesn't look too good...
@aBITmoresalt Looks like Yes on 30, No on 32, No on 34, and No on 37. Bittersweet...
I told myself I would go out and have fun no matter what the results were on election night. Unfortunately, I'm so exhausted...
@SFdirewolf Yeah... definitely disappointing. I'm staying up for a few more hours to keep my eye on the results. Thanks for your support!!
@SFdirewolf Thank you for the update! I just got home from campus, so I've been refreshing the page nonstop... ahh!
@keshemadavidson Congrats on the win!!

You can't pass racism off as satire. 
Next round!

I am still #TroyDavis. Let's honor his memory by working toward a world without the #deathpenalty.

Can't believe it's been a year since Georgia brutally executed #TroyDavis. Let's end the #deathpenalty. #YESon34
Hot bananas - bananas in caramelized sugar, butter, coconut milk, and a dash of rum. SO GOOD.

At @amnesty local group 612's "After Innocence" film screening. Vote #YESon34 -  @SAFECalifornia
You gotta be kidding me. Via @Colorlines: At Towson Univ., A Student Makes His Case for a White Student Union 
In my half-asleep state, writing about how Titus Andronicus' revenge narrative subverts institutional powers that exist. #litmajorproblems
WTF, WaPo? MT @ZekeJohnsonAi WaPo op-ed on #NDAA: rulings are judicial activism when WaPo doesn't like them 
Beaten by police, on death row despite serious doubts. Stop the execution of Reggie Clemons! 
Good thing I baked peanut butter cookies this morning to assuage the sorrow I feel over the #CalFootball loss. #nomnomnom
"bathrooms with urinals." yeeeeee gender neutral bathrooms!
@ZekeJohnsonAi YAYYYY!
Newsflash - September 13ish 
Cynicism is an easy way out. I won't fall for it.
Way too early in the semester to feel this exhausted... #senioryear
Gitmo Prisoner Dies in Cell 
@goforbroque Audrey, you're too cool!!
exhausted. stressed. trying to work through it!
Life got too busy for Twitter. Boooooo. #senioryear #stillawake
The fine simplicities of life... That's all we need sometimes, really. #senioryear
Sprained ankle. Chug coffee. Late for class.
Nothing says "Welcome back to Berkeley" like 12+ hour days. #senioryear
@chealsye Thanks for the advice!!
@chealsye Ahhh! Did you end up not writing one? My topic is distortion, reflection, and embodiment of indigeneity in early American lit.
So torn. I probably don't have enough time to write an honors thesis, but I want to! I should probably drop the course. #senioryear
I actually enjoy reading for class. I just wish I had more time. #nerdstatus #senioryear
My summer in a snapshot 
Oh Twitter, forgive me for neglecting you. The beginning of the year is always so hectic! #workworkwork
I want to do the honors thesis, but I don't know if I'll have time for it. #dilemma #senioryear
@KierbenG Aw Ben, I wish I could table with you! Lure people into human rights work with your charm and aura of awesomeness. :)
@auntiesam77 Thanks, Sam! Hope you have a fantastic year at UCLA. :)
@KalaMendoza Don't really know the actual impact, but this page sort of helps: 
So #senioryear begins with many nonsensical texts and calls. Am I ready? I don't know. But I'll be fine.
Gorgeous day in Berkeley! Walking around campus as a referee for work related scavenger hunt. #simplethings
@gautamrnarula Congratulations, Gautam!!!
Let's call it what it is: racism. RT @StaycoolFanzine Hipster Racism broken down @huantea 
Backlogged work is really unhealthy for me. The only cure for my anxiety at this point is to work through it.  #motivation
Really regret drinking that second cup of coffee at 730pm. Past 2am and I'm wide awake. #caffeinefail
