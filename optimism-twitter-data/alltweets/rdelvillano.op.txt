@mattradickal What a dream!
@lizombies Same
.@lizombies has been slowly eating this same bag of pretzels since moving to Seattle back in August. 
Just saw a grown man wearing the tiniest straw fedora.
@johnwhanley Solid plan. I was at Emerald City CC getting a start on the west coast this year.
@johnwhanley I didn't get my invite! I'll be in San Diego in about two months though!
@mattradickal @verge It's a cool concept, but intentionally dismissing content hurts my soul.
@mattradickal @verge The part about Comixology Guided View leaving out "unnecessary" parts of the art. Excuse me? Uh, what?
@mattradickal As long as it keeps you regular then I consider that a win. In fact, I'm winning right now!
@Spakdaddy I saw them play about two weeks ago. Then I was accidentally standing next to the vocalist when seeing Waxahatchee last week.
I have a spare download code for All-New #Hawkeye 1 if anyone's interested.
@zipmon I already have my badge, just need to figure out travel and hotel!
@mattradickal *macho
@zipmon You might actually be my hero.
@ConorMcMahon64 I'm sure, I'm just tired of waiting. Haha
@TheLastMetroid Thanks, Lee. I've just felt creatively bankrupt for a while now. Don't want to force what's not there.
When I meet new people I say that I'm an "illustrator," but what I actually mean is "I don't have a full-time job, but I draw sometimes."
It's been almost a year since I've written or drawn anything important or meaningful. I don't feel like it's in me anymore.
Looking for optimistic and happy people to occupy my life. I need someone who will rub off on me.
Had a dream last night in which I was arguing about how good a song George Michael's Faith is.
Happy #FCBD! Just a reminder that my webcomic is free today! And every day. It's always free. Please read it. 
@BrookeAAllen A big reason I moved to Seattle was to locate a Sasquatch. I believe they are gentle, misunderstood creatures with large feet.
@Zen_Burden Perfect!
@Zen_Burden What you got?
"A student got caught with a fake hall pass today. He said it was from me but he signed it 'Mrs. Buckers.'" - @lizombies
@VinSpee Look at who Twitter suggest I follow on their page: 
S/o to @BNBuzz for breaking street date and selling this to me early. 
Last week I saved a bird from being pecked to death by a larger bird. Today I got pooped on. Is this how karma works?
@atypewriter Yes! Always! Where from?
@atypewriter @SHO_Dexter The books are for sale on Amazon. I was looking at them earlier.
@atypewriter @SHO_Dexter I have never watched it, but I do like the idea of one murderer thinking he's more morally sound than another.
PSA: The word "hipster" is a noun. The adjective is "hip."

If you need to use it, please do so correctly. Stop saying "s/he is so hipster."
@katadav @brittanyxweaver Trying to wrap my head around this. Do you two know each other?
@atypewriter This might interest you: 
@brittanyxweaver If you do the math, you would be making about $99k per year. I would probably just buy the house at that point.
@brittanyxweaver We basically did. We actually laughed a lot at how absurd it was.
@mattradickal Nope. They want everyone individually to make three times the total rent. Lol.
@twinworld Our thoughts exactly! I'd just buy the house if I was making that much!
Just tried renting a 3br house in Seattle for $2,750/mo. The owners have absurd income demands. Look at this mess: 
@AlecLongstreth Oh! Right on! In that case, welcome back!
@atypewriter @mattradickal @katadav Lol. No one knows about my web comic.
@atypewriter @mattradickal @katadav Messengers hurt my shoulders. EMAIL KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME.
@AlecLongstreth For comics or pinball? Either way, I feel like I'm missing something.
@mattradickal @ChumpedBand Word. This was probably the first thing I noticed.
.@ChumpedBand covering Sex Bob-omb might be the most important thing currently happening in music. 
@LambHummus @katadav @mattradickal Very weak
@katadav @mattradickal Does tumblr also have a limit to uploads per post though? I feel like it might be 10.
@mattradickal You want them to be accessible, but you don't want to flood Twitter. Maybe post one or two here with a link to the rest?
@mattradickal I'd say a Facebook album (despite previously tweeted qualms) is the best option. Or tumblr.
@andersmildieu It looked like no one else took the swing <BASEBALL>️
@andersmildieu What his name?
Looked at myself in the mirror for the first time today. 
Circus dog 
@Sneakyness As long as you link back to the source, feel free to do whatever you want.
@Sneakyness I fully encourage you to start a rival comic.
@Sneakyness Hahaha. Sorry! Creative Director told me I couldn't outsource. Always accepting idea/script submissions though!
@katadav Hah! I'm so glad that a ladder ball victory was our first encounter.
@katadav Well, thank you. Very glad to hear this.
@mattradickal I'm finding more and more that people think I dislike them. This is a significant bummer.
@DaveLetcavage Word. I got it. I didn't realize you were initially talking about that. Thought you meant acnl wasn't a "proper" release.
@DaveLetcavage That's fair. I forgot about that new one. Seems like a spin-off to me.
If I come across as disinterested, I'm probably very interested. I just don't want to say something that would disinterest you.
Over the past 25 years, I've become very good at making very bad first impressions.
@DaveLetcavage "Proper"? New Leaf is easily the best AC game.
If you're looking for something funny and cool to read this weekend, it might be my webcomic. Also, maybe not. 
@dazcalvert @DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 Three brothers
@SoushokukeiDino Haha. No worries! Like I said, I'll get back yo you tomorrow about a trade. You want Wii Party U for a Plat award, right?
@mattradickal holla.
@mattradickal I got Komodo Dragon.
@VinSpee @anamanaguchi @shawnwasabi This is mesmerizing.
@angels_green Nah. I don't like doing that.
Lots of shirtless middle-aged dudes in Seattle Center today looking like they're posing for sad paintings.
Passing notes to lovers.

Passing notes, to lovers.

Passing, notes to lovers.


What would be your ideal last meal? Something homemade? Junk food? Would you want to eat at all?
@Sneakyness You're hired. The gig pays nothing. Comics due on my desk by 12:30 AM. Lots of work, little reward. The whole situation bites.
@Sneakyness You're already better than me.
It's been werewolf puns all week at 
Video: Seattle, WA, near the fountain in Seattle Center. 
@mattradickal I've heard good things about Man Without Fear, Yellow, and Born Again. I have read none.
@nintendolife @jonwahlgren @NintendoAmerica I was actually just there! The panel was pretty great!
@DaveLetcavage Error: You are a Dork.
@comicnrrd I just saw the same person walking down the street here in Seattle. I do not understand.
Finally giving this beauty from @STSPhonoCo a spin: 
@katadav @atypewriter - @lizombies just walked into the bathroom with lemongrass scented soap. It must be spring!
Video: Oakland University, from across campus. 
Literally always. 
If you haven't already, there are two hours left to back @STSPhonoCo's Mother OST Kickstarter. Act quick!


Video: Oakland University, from across campus. 
@mattradickal I have not listened to them, but you are correct. I am diggin' it.
@STSPhonoCo "Psyduck-Inspired"
Bye
@SpaceKappa I'd like to see a series about video games that you hate but spend countless hours playing anyway. You know, something original.
@Alex_Olney I have access to my Wii U for the next few days. Would love to get in some Smash if you're recording.
@Zen_Burden @rchlsnk It's a myth.
@jake_shapiro @DaveLetcavage Not sure how much of this is honest and how much is a naughty joke.
@DaveLetcavage I'm probably going to stick with downloads anyway. I'm a sucker for the games!
@DaveLetcavage Thanks for this! I like the Pikmin bag, but I like simple totes. The messenger looks like it would leave me wanting more.
@DaveLetcavage Maybe a pic with something inside the bag to give a better idea of size? Also, wasn't the print supposed to be black?
@DaveLetcavage inside, pockets, strap, whatever secures the flap, etc.

I am very serious about bags.
@DaveLetcavage more pics, please.
@Sneakyness isn't everything?
@Sneakyness Mostly just my mom wearing different costumes.
@Sneakyness Aww, man. Now I feel bad. You're one of like six people who genuinely care about my comic.
@SpaceKappa Best to just stay off of the internet today. I don't need to tell you that though.
@SpaceKappa Wouldn't this be the worst day to announce actual bad news?
After over 2.5 years and 900 comics, I'm calling it a day. Thanks for all of your support! You're all the best! 
@LadyStarstorm Going for Lillie. Was set on Iris, but she's already married to her work!
@eepaziii Play the W101 demo on the console to help you decide. I couldn't really get into that one either, but I have friends who love it.
@eepaziii So you're sticking with DL games? Good call. Earthbound is an obvious one, but W101 is a great deal. I'm not into DKCR.
@shanito Read this as "bigfoot" and got excited/sad.
ICYMI: Today's webcomic is based on an actual conversation I had with a law student at an accredited university. 
@eepaziii Always, brother. I've been waiting to redeem mine as well. Anything you've been eying?
@eepaziii Elite rewards should be announced tomorrow. I recommend waiting until then before redeeming anything.
Today's #comic is based on an actual conversation I once had. 
@DaveLetcavage That looks and sounds about right. Haha
@DaveLetcavage Where are you living now? That looks like every Detroit suburb.
@ConorMcMahon64 "We are also delaying Xenoblade 3D"
I reviewed a really cool farming sim that ISN'T SECRETLY HARVEST MOON. 
I made a dumb joke about #WrestleMania today: 
Got to take a really dumb selfie with one of my heroes this weekend. Thanks again for everything, @kellysue 
@Alex_Olney I've run the numbers.
@straf3y The greatest irony is that I'm missing the Seattle show because I'm going back to Detroit. Everything is awful.
@Alex_Olney Your commentary in Smash Highlights 9 is too funny. You talk SO much, but only about 3% of it is about the game.
I got to interview Aaron Hamel of @STSPhonoCo on their Mother OST Kickstarter. Very cool, intelligent, and genuine: 
Me, anywhere, ever, all the time: "man, I sure am unsatisfied."
Me at comic cons: "man, I wish there was more video game stuff here"

Me at video game cons: "man, I wish there was more comic stuff here"
@straf3y I believe it. I have to miss the show in Seattle because I'm the worst person I know.
@mattradickal Oh, yuck.
@pushsquare But she was my main!
Just heard some guy identify @kellysue as "the female writer of Captain Marvel." Well done, sir. Well done.
Favorite game to play at @emeraldcitycon: Trying to identify if someone is a Tank Girl cosplayer or just a crust punk.
@STSPhonoCo @nintendolife Thank YOU for letting me accost you for 30 minutes.
@comiXology Looking forward to meeting you there!
@lizombies Nailed it.
@zipmon @ninabeebuzz Who's playing?
@Foxtrot44 I got a low-end pair for podcast production a few years back. Best headphones I've ever owned.
@Foxtrot44 I stand by Sennheiser for quality for the price.
@essrose Yeah, the commute can be awful with all of the traffic out here.
@essrose I moved out here specifically to find them. Still haven't seen a single one.
Drawing comics and eating ice cream directly from the carton because I have nowhere to be and nothing to lose.
@Alex_Olney Looks like someone changed your tagline in our Splatoon impressions...
@Sneakyness It's basically the premise of my comic. Monsters doing normal stuff, but they're terrible at it because they're dumb monsters.
@Sneakyness Loved it.
@Zen_Burden I don't get it.
@eepaziii Thank you for never doubting.
A dream came true today as I made my @Playboy debut in the background of this #Splatoon video [SFW]: 
"Gimme an IPA."
"/wʊd yo͞o laɪk ə dɹɪŋk/?"
@blues_traveler @EldoonLDP Much respect to BT for being able to take a joke. Good luck with the new project!
@EldoonLDP "How can we make a record that will appeal to people who had awful taste in music seven years ago?"
@eepaziii Land of the free, baby.
.@Alex_Olney and I went hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming shooter #Splatoon. Check out our preview at @nintendolife 
@Sneakyness This isn't real. Is this real?
@bensears what is it?
@bensears Is that bottom one a brush?
@jake_shapiro Is there something wrong with having some buds around?
@jake_shapiro Is there something wrong with a little camaraderie?
@jake_shapiro how else are you supposed to know to whom he is referring?
I promise that tomorrow I'll be back to the all-ages family friendly stuff. 
It's amazing what you can put in a #webcomic in 2015 
Things get a little risqué in my #webcomic today. 
@STSPhonoCo I can assure you that it was not.
@sethmnookin @nytimes Fair point. Just seems reasonable after fumbling through a correction like this.
@sethmnookin @nytimes Was this in print? If not, can't the article just be pulled?
Currently listening to: Bjork, played very loud by my neighbor in an attempt to unsuccessfully mask the sound of her aggressive vomiting.
@mattradickal a Dorito is essentially a flavored tortilla chip. If there was a standard, why wouldn't it be Nacho?
@mattradickal I'd settle on Nacho.
@mattradickal real answer: it's a tossup between nacho or whatever and cool ranch.
@mattradickal tortilla chips
@nintendolife Duane!
@JazRignall @DamienMcFerran Have the two of you never actually met? I was under the impression that you had!
@EldoonLDP 

*implying this wouldn't be you*
@JazRignall It was great spending time with you today! Safe travels!
Just been hanging out in this boring office building all day. 
@jonwahlgren Fair enough. I'm not really in the market though.
@jonwahlgren You grabbing another?
@jonwahlgren Does this mean Thursday is canceled? There is no Thursday?
@Alex_Olney again? I'm out.
@Alex_Olney I'm here! What do you need?
@ConorMcMahon64 Very avant-garde. I am looking forward to the full-length.
@Alex_Olney Are the colors from the F-Zero print flowing into the Pokemon print by design, or was that coincidence?
@ConorMcMahon64 Nailed it.
@Alex_Olney You should have farted.
@superconsole This person just gets it. Really gets to the core of Monster Hunter.
@GoldMetalSonic That was's me, it was @DaveLetcavage! And I think he probably did.
@TomServo_89 @nintendolife Awesome! Let me know what you think!
@Foxtrot44 Yikes. That might be worse.
Literally just realized how dumb it is that I write a comic about monsters year-round. This subject matter isn't timely at all.
@mattradickal Ugh. All this READING.
@mattradickal Can I select pricing? Can it be free?
@mattradickal I have not heard of any of this. All those issue 1s tho.
@trintran It was great meeting you last week! My writeup on the #ZeldaSymphony just went live on @nintendolife 
@TrevorSGraham Does AppleCare cover that kind of stuff?
@TrevorSGraham No scratches or scuffs? I'm probably going to stick with a basic case on the body for the sake of traction, but no screen.
@TrevorSGraham AppleCare protection?
iPhone 6 users: screen protector - y/n?
@CoryRocker You look like a corpse.
If anyone pre-ordered #codenameSTEAM from GameStop and doesn't want their Majora's Mask pin, I'll gladly take it off your hands :D
I don't like that an all-male Ghostbusters is being made because people complained, but I LOVE the idea of a Ghostbusters extended universe.
@DaveLetcavage All of my consoles that aren't a 3DS are still in MI.
I don't care about anything that isn't #OlliOlli
@johnwhanley Yikes. That's too bad and all too common. I feel like a lot of great comic stories get rushed near the end.
@car2goSeattle <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@johnwhanley Been wanting to read Beautiful Darkness since the translation was announced a few years back. Still haven't picked it up.
Just experienced some top-notch customer service from @car2goSeattle. Good CS makes a world of difference. 10/10
@car2goSeattle @lizombies Thanks! I just DM'd my email to you.
@johnwhanley I was looking through How To Be Happy today. My partner is a fan of Davis's style.
@lizombies @car2goSeattle You need to follow back or I can't DM. Also, what contact info would you prefer?
Apple claiming to reinvent the keyboard but they're still shipping QWERTY. #Dvorak2015
@mattradickal I regularly think about how upset I will be if you don't change your Twitter handle to "mattdadickal" when you have a child.
@Foxtrot44 @SpaceKappa I'm currently in Seattle. Do you two know each other, or is this just the gaming world colliding?
@SpaceKappa That's what I was thinking. Too weird.
@SpaceKappa @Foxtrot44 my Twitter feed is currently Inception. 
@eepaziii Protip: if you begin a tweet with a handle (like this one) it won't show up on all of your followers' feeds, but it is on your own
@jonwahlgren Is the machine taking you for a ride?
@jonwahlgren Niiiiice. Getting your day-drink on?
@jonwahlgren Where you at?
@brittanyxweaver I do and it is.
@oaklandu Know of any alumni hiring English majors in Seattle, WA?
@lizombies Did you break one of our mugs?
@DaveLetcavage @CoryRocker I think it was a nature documentary about birds. I remember asking about one of the birds that I had never seen.
@DaveLetcavage @CoryRocker Nah. We were just hanging out. Nothing TOO special.
@CoryRocker I had a cool dream last night where I was making stir fry in your apartment. Then you came home and we watched TV.
@GiantBreadbug Very much looking forward to this.
@GiantBreadbug Sounds good! Let me know when you're available!
@GiantBreadbug Hey Dylan, welcome to the @nintendolife team! Now I'm calling you out as a Jigglypuff master.

1v1 on 3DS?
@DaveLetcavage it crossed my mind too, bud.
@DaveLetcavage Fair enough! Gotta even the playing field somehow.
@DaveLetcavage relentless optimist, aye?
@CRB29 It feels like a violation of personal space. Also, the dryer next to mine was empty and available when they did it.
Apparently I share an apartment building with a monster who thinks it's okay to take my wet clothes out of the dryer and put theirs in.
@lizombies @atypewriter Old-timey nudes in Georgetown.
@straf3y You'll have to let me know how that goes. Very much looking forward to seeing Chumped.
@straf3y It's been on my calendar for a few months now, friend!
@LadyStarstorm I should be there Monday. Will keep you posted.
I make a comic about #TheDress, @tumblr enjoys it: 
I envy relentless optimists and the people who have relentless optimists in their lives.
@mattradickal As much as I hate to admit it, that was @lizombies's find.
Today's #webcomic: still not a comic, even more bad puns. 
Today's #webcomic: not really a comic, full of bad puns. 
@jake_shapiro I know. I was actually kidding. I'm mostly indifferent to this. I liked the novel when I read it 10+ years ago, but that's it.
@jake_shapiro Is there a date on this? I need to know exactly when to give up completely.
@jake_shapiro Gotta get that money, honey.
@jake_shapiro It's just using the branding for recognition and as an explanation for why there are so many spider-men in it.
@jake_shapiro Could be, but the "spinning out of" bit makes me think it exists outside of the spider-verse storyline.
@jake_shapiro Still confusing, but makes sense in a "this will make money" sort of way.
@jake_shapiro Wait. I get it. This is an actual series based on the concept. Before it was just a storyline infiltrating other series'
@jake_shapiro Are you sure it's not a trade?
@jake_shapiro I read most of spider-verse. You're saying they're already rebooting it?
@jake_shapiro What?
@SpaceKappa I need one of these.
@Roll_7 @pushsquare Very cool. Very into this.
Rare image of the wild @lizombies in her natural state. 
@Alex_Olney @nintendolife Close enough!


@nintendolife @Alex_Olney Thanks for the very silly shoutout!
Transcribing a pair of short interviews for @nintendolife and @pushsquare early this morning. Great stuff from @NISAmerica!
@7MileKid313 Going well! Currently in San Francisco but heading back to Seattle soon.
Last night my #webcomic reached 500 @tumblr followers. If you enjoy silly stories and terrible gags, please follow:

@antdickens @nintendolife Thanks, boss. I actually noticed that it looked good in this pic too. Haha
@nintendolife about to get serious up in here. #new3DSelfie 
@lizombies hehe.
@lizombies haha.
@lizombies lol.
@Snoopy DID I MISS THE #BeagleHugs?!
@andersmildieu Yep. Tumblr mostly just provides "here's a long list of people who did something on one of your pages."
@andersmildieu I've got that going, but most of the traffic was directly through tumblr dashboards. Those don't count as page views.
@Foxtrot44 Haha. I had a feeling...
Still trying to figure out why my #webcomic gained so much traction yesterday. 
@OUWrtCtr can I be on the map too? #IWCWeek 
@Zen_Burden No prob. I'm mean, but generous.
@Zen_Burden Not true. You know that. I am a mean bean though.
@Zen_Burden I'm a little offended that you'd think I'm "kinda dumb."
@Zen_Burden Two outta three ain't bad.
@ferricide @SpaceKappa Might also have to do with all the other MP characters being represented in the Smash line w/ the same functionality?
@wearseatbelts If I see it, it has my vote. <FRENCH FRIES><REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U + REG>
@wearseatbelts I will ALWAYS favorite this.
@Foxtrot44 That's great! I love that people are sharing them. It feels like people are starting to connect with them. I hope you enjoy!
@Foxtrot44 Thanks a lot! I appreciate that! Would you mind if I ask how you found it? My follower count isn't huge, so I'm always curious.
@mattradickal I am always running to a toilet. You will also find out in due time.
@Foxtrot44 Thanks for following and for following my comic on tumblr! I don't usually get to see fans of the comic on other platforms!
@mattradickal I'd love to hear about what the toilet did.
@thatpixelguy I have. Unsurprisingly, it plays like 3U. Very excited for that second stick on Friday.
Now that the embargo is lifted, I can say that I've been playing Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for a couple weeks and it is very, very good.

@TrevorSGraham Yeah, okay.
@mattradickal It's worded fine, except for "let's"
@NintendoForce Great! I purchased it a little while ago and I'm just waiting for the download link to come through.
@NintendoForce Is issue 13 available digitally now? Still says pre-order online but has a date of January 26.
My #webcomic gained 100 @tumblr followers in the past month. How/why did this happen? Never mind! Just thank you! 
@jake_shapiro Thank you for clarifying. I will now stop worrying.
@jake_shapiro I believe I was in 10th grade that year. Hair past my shoulders, plaid pants, punk shirts. Not much has changed.
@jake_shapiro @anszhra What year is this? Why are your pants so baggy?
@CoryRocker Here it is. It's actually a Kotaku "review," but it should help. 
@CoryRocker I once read an article about how football is essentially a turn-based rpg. If I can find it, I'll forward it along.
@jake_shapiro @DaveLetcavage Not entirely sure what to do with this new information. Should we post a news piece? #AlteredBeast2015
@jake_shapiro @DaveLetcavage Play a real game, nerds. #AlteredBeast2015
@DamienMcFerran Surely we know it's best not to engage?
@comicnrrd I think I would have trouble digesting the plastic.
@jonwahlgren Do work or you will die.
@lizombies What?
@lizombies again?
@CarlyWilutis @mattradickal @lizombies Love that I'm not part of this conversation or even aware of it until now.
@katadav I'm out.
@AmberOsterholt It seems like BB is doing everything they can to make up for the limited stock. Personally, I'd go with the $50 off.
@AmberOsterholt Ah. That's really too bad. Must have oversold? Are they offering $50 off of the New XL, or is it the current model?
@STREETRUNNR305 @nintendolife Yeah, lots of different reports coming in now. Did you pre-order?
@AmberOsterholt Thanks for forwarding this. It seems like there are a lot of conflicting reports right now. Cc: @nintendolife
@mattradickal You did a quantum leap?
@mattradickal I did not know that. Makes sense though. Very excited.
@mattradickal New Mountain Goats track about Chavo Guerrero 
@mattradickal @andersmildieu Like, cover a deep cut or whatever, but don't cover the song from Fight Club just to get attention.
@mattradickal @andersmildieu I have never listened to Bandit, but putting a cover of Where Is My Mind on an album seems hacky.
@SonicLucario Interesting! I'm guessing there really is no street date then.

@GazPlant I don't know why we were at the airport, but I was trying to get work done and you were really pushing to watch that film. Haha
@GazPlant I had a dream the other night that we were sitting in an airport and you really wanted to watch The Imitation Game on my laptop.

@wearseatbelts I kinda hate to ask, but how old did you think he was?
@jake_shapiro @DaveLetcavage MP1 is rad. 2 &amp; 3 are plagued by Wii FPS motion controls.

@jonwahlgren @LadyStarstorm Right. That's what I'm saying. Until NoA says "it's not coming," there's no reason to jump to any conclusions.
@jonwahlgren I feel like this lack of confirmation doesn't necessarily mean it won't come. Just not right now.

This also plays into the recent "The Interview" debacle. Concern for safety shouldn't be an issue with free speech in art. #JeSuisCharlie

@wearseatbelts No, I'm right downstairs.
@SpaceKappa Thanks for sharing this. I've been curious about what other people think.
@SpaceKappa I agree with this. But you don't feel the need to watch other shows just because it's the medium you work in?
@SpaceKappa Do you make your show because you don't enjoy the other content available? Do you make it because it's what you'd like to see?
@SpaceKappa I was specifically hoping you would see this. I write a webcomic, I don't read webcomics. I feel guilty. Been struggling w/this.
Content creators: do you consume media in your genre/medium because you enjoy it, or do you feel an obligation to?
@DaveLetcavage @Jelani_AN Unless there was cross-play, I'd be pretty disappointed. It'd just be like HM: A Wonderful Life/Mineral Town. :/

@SpaceKappa I'm going to wear a yellow shirt to PAX that reads "JOE WALKER DID IT."
Reading the first issue of @IDWPublishing's Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland and geeking out over fantastic use of the form. Stunning.
@jake_shapiro Keep me posted! Or PM me your address if you want some of my books for free ;)
@jake_shapiro Do you do consignment? I'd love to get my books there.

Just let @rdelvillano know if …
Montana, you sure are pretty. 
Her and me and some old guys. 
The Badlands of South Dakota with @lizombies 
Beginning the trek to Seattle tomorrow. I should probably pack a bag or two.
@CoryRocker They got my submission?!
@lukediamondp Was it my mom? Are you at my house?
@CoryRocker I only understand and relate to events when they're loosely compared to video games because I am a dolt. Polygon understands.
I reviewed yet another LEGO video game: “@nintendolife: Review: LEGO Ninjago: Nindroids (3DS) 
@antdickens @nintendolife I'd be lying if I said you haven't come close ;)
Today marks four years that I've been writing for @nintendolife! To celebrate, I'm not playing video games!
@jake_shapiro You're pitching to the wrong guy! I'd actually love to do a weekly advice column. You listening, @nintendolife?
@jake_shapiro Is that why your fanfic has been so bland lately? I was wondering about that seamstress character.
@TrevorSGraham @jesseburchett Tuesday at 8. Fin's in New Baltimore. Please show up for goodbyes.
@brittanyxweaver I'm sure I'll be fine. Just need to invest in more tank tops.
@brittanyxweaver Good lord. Seattle sounds like a nightmare.
@brittanyxweaver No AC? Sorry, I can't move in.
@CoryRocker You're pregnant.
@forlornfunnies Sitting alone in a Wendy's and I just realized it's been a while. Any word on Bygone 2?
@sam3214 *Mark As Spam*
@Steven2480 I can't make any guarantees, but hopefully.
@brittanyxweaver That's the hope! I'll probably be crashing with @wearseatbelts for a bit.
@TrevorSGraham Friday or Saturday. I think I have Monday free?
@TrevorSGraham When were you thinking? I'm running out of time.
I was recently told that I'm rude for not publicly announcing this, so here it goes: next week I am driving to Seattle and staying there.
@spacekappa I feel like that shouldn't be too difficult to find!
@spacekappa Bit of an exaggeration, but I have one of these I'd be willing to sell: 
@spacekappa What about your 3DS XL?
@spacekappa Why?
I think this is the first time I've drawn my entire "super-team" together. I dedicate my life to very silly things. 
@mattradickal @lizombies “@WarOnWomyn: Good people of Earth! We still need a place to stay in/around #GrandRapids, MI on Aug 19th. #help”
Most of my Twitter stream is talking about Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's a great film so we're all still cool.
@SpaceKappa That's what she said v.2
@SpaceKappa That's what she said.
@antdickens Something, something, human genome project.
@antdickens This is great. I love this so much.
@antdickens This is only the beginning. You're next.
@antdickens My man. 
I reviewed a game: “@nintendolife: Review: Rabi Laby 3 (3DS eShop) 
@lukediamondp That Stars jersey tho.
@ThomasBW84 my question: "who is the best looking member of the NL team and why is it Ron?"
@DaveLetcavage my thoughts exactly. Also, Kevin Smith is a hack.
@brittanyxweaver #grossfoodporn
@brittanyxweaver Word. 
@DaveLetcavage are you playing while in a puzzled mood?
I reviewed an old game on a newish console: “@nintendolife: Review: Bases Loaded (Wii U eShop / NES) 
@DaveLetcavage are you playing in puzzle mode?
I reviewed a solid drawing app: “@nintendolife: Review: Comic Workshop (3DS eShop) 
@superconsole That's usually the case!

@TrevorSGraham I'm always open for new projects.
@amandoline You are internet famous! “@kellysue: Photo: Kamala fan art! 
@jake_shapiro @nintendolife Serious bummer. I was thinking this morning how crushed I'd be if I lost mine.
@antdickens In all seriousness, change is good. Brand recognition is important!
@antdickens I literally just got a NL shirt. Can this at least wait until after PAX?
@CoryRocker That's a kick in the teeth.
@CoryRocker of course. Do you know if I can activate the code for PS3, or is it PS4 exclusive?
@CoryRocker I might have a beta code and not a PS4. Are they region specific?
I reviewed a game and the dev got mad at me in the comments: “@nintendolife: Review: Internal Invasion (Wii U eShop) 
@comicnrrd So pumped for this!
@imbillyking @comic_con This app is really great. I'm going to start using it at home too. Thanks for your help!
@imbillyking @comic_con This is really great. Thanks so much! Glad to see Burger Lounge has GF buns.
@imbillyking @comic_con I appreciate that. I went to Gaslamp Pizza in the past, but I'm guessing they don't cater to dietary restrictions.
@imbillyking @Comic_Con That's rough. All I need is a slice of pizza or two!
@Comic_Con Hey! Do you know of any places in Gaslamp that are gluten free? Thanks!
@bensears There's a demo on the eShop. I thought it was boring and laggy.
@AlecLongstreth I always do!
@AlecLongstreth Just got mine in the mail! Congrats on completing a successful campaign!
So stoked! Who wants a button?! 
@ThomasBW84 Still waiting for confirmation of Jigglypuff. They're flooding the game with Pokemon who aren't her :(
@Capndrake @nintendolife If it makes you feel any better, I ordered it and paid with my own money :P
@nintendolife This is unreal. Can't stop laughing.
@lizombies WHAT.
@wearseatbelts @brittanyxweaver 
@lizombies my toad hunting fashion game is strong.
@SpaceKappa @nintendolife Always and forever. It's all I've got!

@jake_shapiro I think I have the first tpb but I have't looked at it yet. Will do though!
@jake_shapiro I do like strong ladies. And I still have pulls at a shop, but I read mostly digitally now.
@jake_shapiro Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Ghost, Serenity, Saga, Buffy, and Angel &amp; Faith. You?
@jake_shapiro I'm mad jelly. I've been reading a lot of comics lately, so that's something.
@jake_shapiro If that's what you want to talk about!
@jake_shapiro LET'S TALK ABOUT COMICS.
@jake_shapiro Nice ;)
@trintran I thought this tweet was going to have something to do with gardening.
@dazcalvert I figured you'd be captain!
@dazcalvert Why aren't you riding today?!
@wearseatbelts Sup, kiddo?
@CoryRocker Is this directed at any/every American tweeting about the World Cup? Because I completely agree.
@lizombies You are the grossest.
@DaveLetcavage @CoryRocker Bros, mine is out on Tuesday.
@lukediamondp just saw a dumpy guy outside the Flint Local with a Green Day shirt on. It wasn't you.
@brittanyxweaver Probably. They tend to do surprise shows in the area every now and again, so I wouldn't be surprised.
@brittanyxweaver I saw Suicide Machines play in my friend's basement about a year ago. I was kick flipping with excitement!
I reviewed a crummy aquarium simulator: “@nintendolife: Review: My Aquarium: Seven Oceans (DSiWare) 
A question for artists on @instagram: why are some of your accounts private? Don't you want us so see what you're working on?
@ChrisTheHoff I get that. I usually try for open and honest communication though. Next time, just be upfront. He has no room to be offended.
@ChrisTheHoff If you haven't already, you should probably just tell him that.
@CoryRocker @GazPlant I know. I'm not proud. Hardly ever am.
@CoryRocker @GazPlant I WAS TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE SEMEN, RORY.
@CoryRocker @GazPlant Meant to put "seedy" in quotes, then spelled it wrong. Seed = semen.
@CoryRocker I'm so stupid.
@CoryRocker more like "seady" bars.
@gregwiggleton I'm glad we could provide you with some constructive criticism!
@gregwiggleton Thanks for reaching out. Obviously it's nothing personal. I think future updates would be great!

@zipmon @DaveLetcavage I hate video games.
@CoryRocker Two weeks ago you were ready to sell your PS4.
@lizombies :/
My good friend @vincenttroia just got Duane tattooed on his leg. My webcomic is now permanently on… 
@zipmon That sounds enticing!
@nintendolife @NoNoiseChitChat HELP. Do I get Shovel Knight for Wii U or 3DS?!
@straf3y Oh, sure. Message me your addy, daddy.
@DaveLetcavage @nintendolife Kinda looks like this combine harvester is spraying blood: 
Just found three Duane tees, all size Men's L. Free to the first three people who claim them. 
I reviewed a pretty good mobile game that got ported to 3DS: “@nintendolife: Review: 2048 (3DS eShop) 
@CoryRocker are you excited though?
@CoryRocker Facebook just alerted me that you are "feeling excited." Why am I getting these notifications? 
@Deltsoulman What a nightmarish place to be trapped!
@lukediamondp I'm pretty sure this is a cover of Black Out Band. 
I went to @BestBuy to play the new Super Smash Bros. Game. Here's what happened: 
@eternalnintendo Fair enough. I guess I need to decide what appeals to me more: The American Revolution or pirates. It's a toss up.
@eternalnintendo Man, you're all over the place. Haha. Thanks for the info though. I'm thinking I might go with III.
@eternalnintendo Do they both play the same? I know there have been some changes game-to-game. Also, which is more fun?
I've never played an Assassin's Creed game and I don't really care about the plot. Should I jump in at III or IV?
Today I found a four-leaf clover. #sundaysketch 
@jake_shapiro Honestly, I don't think I ran into the problems that you're facing.
@jake_shapiro I played through it again about a year ago. Great stuff. Challenging in all the right ways.
@CoryRocker Hey. I'm a little drunk. Want to come over?
@jake_shapiro Based on my Twitter feed today, you are bad at old-timey video games.
@SpaceKappa I'd be happy to take a look for you. Like I said though, just remind me closer to the date. Or even text me that week.
@SpaceKappa You can hug me when I actually get it. Haha. Seems like that'll probably be in high demand.
@SpaceKappa Remind me again in about a month.
@CoryRocker Bro, come over. Come over, bro.

Just drove behind someone with the license plate "MILHOUS"
@DamienMcFerran I know! I watched it! Letterman was born a humourless curmudgeon.
@DamienMcFerran Don't worry. Letterman hasn't been funny or relevant for ages.
@MegaWatts64 My mistake! Thought you were looking for help.
@MegaWatts64 I work at a uni Writing Center and sometimes work with personal statements. I could look at yours if you want.
@ThomasBW84 @zipmon Not sure what you're talking about, Tom. We can discuss this later. See you at home.
@zipmon @ThomasBW84 Tom is the champ of my heart.
@SpaceKappa @jonwahlgren I think that's a great idea. It's rad that your show is featured on another site now, but it might hurt expansion.
@SpaceKappa @jonwahlgren One of you is taking this way more seriously than the other, and I feel like it's the wrong one.
@SpaceKappa @LadyStarstorm Weekly Nintendo podcast? I might have some folks. CC: @jonwahlgren @zipmon
@lizombies barely.
Today is the final day to pay what you want (min $1) for the LWoP book I illustrated. 20% of proceeds go to charity. 
@lizombies Bro. Wanna chill?
@serafinowicz Sup?
@CoryRocker Ouch. Maybe we can just tweet each other reaction pics? 
@CoryRocker Not only am I a jerk, but I am also poor.
@CoryRocker Fly out here. We can watch the Nintendo presser at 12pm together tomorrow.
@CoryRocker Yes, I know.
@CoryRocker 9pm
@jake_shapiro Mine has never had a "major" issue. Just minor inconveniences. And lots of lost game data. Haha
@jake_shapiro I don't play much VC on Wii U, but I've run into the problem with retail titles at least 10 times. Not since the update.
@jake_shapiro I've had issues with freezing since launch.
@DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 You still have the Happy Meal box on the shelf. I love that.
@zacgormania I'm broomhandle. I'll add you shortly if you're still looking for KartBros.
@CoryRocker Purrrrrr ecstasy.
@CoryRocker "meow" 
@CoryRocker "Rory is in." That poor, poor cat.
@dazcalvert You're welcome.
My pal @forlornfunnies is Kickstarting a film. It's inexcusable that it took me this long to back. Same goes for you. 
@dazcalvert @Capndrake @jellyscare @KMxRetro Yeah, right until Drake showed his face!
@dazcalvert @Capndrake @jellyscare @KMxRetro Sorry I had to bail! Stuff came up!
@dazcalvert We need more people in here!
@dazcalvert I just created a room. Any other @nintendolife folks on?
@dazcalvert Are you flirting with me?

But yes, I'll hop on!
Unsurprisingly, #MarioKart8 makes me curse a lot.
@SpaceKappa If you believe in your heart, then the game is already revealed.
@SpaceKappa If you remember, the PS4 presser showed no signs of an actual console, then they immediately got a boatload of preorders.
@TLatshaw @nintendolife Don't worry, Tim. We luv u, buddy.
@TLatshaw heh heh /@nintendolife 
@zipmon any interest? “@CoryRocker: I would give my left nut to go to E3.”

@CoryRocker is that a fact, Cocker? 
@CoryRocker Great video! You need a shave.
@ChrisTheHoff Sounds like someone knows they made a bad product.
@ThomasBW84 @NoNoiseChitChat Thank you, sir. I'm glad you enjoyed.
@ThomasBW84 unrelated, but I didn't realize you were helping @NoNoiseChitChat format the LWoP book. Thanks for that.
@ThomasBW84 I assumed the thought process was "I see that Ron is online. I'd better take a 10 hour lunch."
@ThomasBW84 I noticed this earlier. It was 3PM (your time). Thought that was odd.
@tlatshaw @nintendolife They're rating me as "slow." The readers know how I operate.

@jake_shapiro I was definitely a ranger at least once. I think I was the black ranger post-film. (95, 96?)
@jake_shapiro I... I don't know how to answer this. I suppose so?
@jake_shapiro Pretty sure I saw them in MI on that same tour.
@wearseatbelts I might end up disappointing you :/
@wearseatbelts I still might be coming at the end of this month. Just have to sort some things out.
@wearseatbelts I was basically wearing the same thing as Josh last time. Already halfway there!
@wearseatbelts Too late! I'm already out in a different costume. Same clothes as last night. I need to expand my wardrobe.

@ConorMcMahon64 America. 
@jake_shapiro and his name is @DamienMcFerran

@essrose I'm super excited for 10 Awkward Years to arrive! Is there any way to get a pdf copy at this point, or did I miss that boat?
@ConorMcMahon64 Different cultures are so fascinating!

@jake_shapiro Sounds naughty.
@ConorMcMahon64 @CoryRocker @ThomasBW84 That is @NoNoiseChitChat's turf. Coincidence?
@ConorMcMahon64 @CoryRocker @ThomasBW84 Yep. The theory is that it's a ready-to-go internment camp.
@ConorMcMahon64 @CoryRocker @ThomasBW84 I flew into this airport once. The whole place is massive and frightening.
@jake_shapiro WAT
@jake_shapiro The Hammer.
In which @ThomasBW84 outdoes himself and proves that he is one of the most important voices in video game journalism: 
@DaveLetcavage @antdickens @GazPlant That's much closer than I thought it would be.
@pattonoswalt You're proving that, in the future, jokes about offensive jokes are more offensive than offensive jokes.
@wearseatbelts I am actively working on solving this dilemma.

@CoryRocker @ThomasBW84 Your advanced degree in Dick Spotting has finally payed off.
@ThomasBW84 It actually killed its creator. Part of it fell and crushed him. It's imposing, irl.
@ThomasBW84 Do you know about the horse statue outside the Denver airport? It's truly nightmarish (no pun intended). 
@ThomasBW84 I remember reading about this while it was still being built. Looks absolutely terrifying.
@ThomasBW84 Were you there?
@ThomasBW84 Sounds about right. All of those games are almost identical.
@ThomasBW84 I know what you're playing ;)

Is there any semblance of an open world on Wii U, or is it all linear stages?
@ThomasBW84 Still waiting for the 3DS version to arrive here. Sounds promising!
@zacgormania I tried that. Today is day 600 and it stresses me out.

@_get2sammyb Those indies tho. Pumped for Jamestown.
@Skullgirls I haven't had any problems with the game, but I appreciate all of your transparency as a company nonetheless. Keep it up.
@pixelpowa those load times are legendary.
@Freecomicbook Is there a list of creator signings for this year? Just checked the site but I may have missed it.
@SpaceKappa He's probably a fan of the show.
Just watched the garbage truck take our trash and all of the recyclable  boxes from our lawn. Left everything in the recycle bin. No good.
@DaveLetcavage Clearly you are @antdickens's good lady.
@nintendolife @CoryRocker I can't begin to count how many phone calls I've received from him requesting this same thing.
@antdickens That's awesome! You're a true gentleman.
@antdickens No, but I can be! When are you in town? And what for?
@antdickens You coming to visit me?!
@conormcmahon64 Thanks a lot, man! I appreciate that.

@ConorMcMahon64 @ThomasBW84 I see nothing wrong with that.
@ConorMcMahon64 @ThomasBW84 Does this happen often? Hahaha
@thomasbw84 Thanks, brother. Now I'm getting all sentimental. #highfive
@thomasbw84 It's reassuring. Makes me feel glad to be part of the team.
@thomasbw84 Yes. But actually because it's still fun for me to see @nintendolife out in the wild.
@thomasbw84 I found one of my receptionists reading your Mario Golf review at work today. I thought that was pretty funny.
@jesseburchett @trevorsgraham This is a good cuddle party.
@gazplant You're a guy I know, I realized I didn't actually know your name, I felt weird about it. That's pretty much it. haha
@gazplant Fair enough. And you're right, I know very little about Football (American or otherwise).
@thomasbw84 Hell of a walk.
@gazplant My guess was Gary, but I have never known anyone else who goes by "Gaz." Random, but relevant.
@gazplant I'm actually curious though. I have no idea what your full name is.
@gazplant Well, that's just not true. haha
@GazPlant What is "Gaz" short for?
@coryrocker I can't stop. Plz send help. I'm going off the GRID for my own safety. it was nice 2 know you.
@CoryRocker don't FALL for any imitators, this seller is the real deal!
@CoryRocker I'd buy it without a SHADOW of a doubt!
@CoryRocker You'd have to be ZONEd out of your mind not to take advantage!
@CoryRocker Looks like a KILLer deal.
@CoryRocker Seems legit.
@wearseatbelts Cold as ice.
@TrevorSGraham I feel you.

@ThomasBW84 I think you're the only person in the world who can write nearly 3,000 words on a golf sim and not give it a score.
@Freecomicbook Going to @VaultOfMidnight. Best shop around!
@spacekappa I assume Detroit's hockey fascination comes from the Wings being good and our proximity to Canada.
@spacekappa Very possible. I just think it's interesting how regional sports can be, even when we're in the same country.
@spacekappa There's a good community here, but I think the majority of Detroiters just don't care about it.
@spacekappa Do people in Sacramento/Boston hate soccer? Because that seems to be the majority opinion here. Lol.
@spacekappa Detroit is a great sports city as we have all four major sports covered, but baseball and hockey get the most affection.
@spacekappa Which sports are big in Cali? And how long have you been in Boston?
@spacekappa Those were my guesses. About the same in Detroit. Just curious what other cities prioritize.
@SpaceKappa What would you say is the biggest sport in Boston?
@YungSethRogen I've heard good things but never read it.
@YungSethRogen I have to go grab my pulls from the shop this week. I'll let you know if I think of or remember anything else.
@YungSethRogen I'd start at the beginning for the sake of continuity.
@YungSethRogen Honorable Mention goes to Marvel 1602. 

Beyond that, don't worry about publishers. Just read the stories that you enjoy.
@CoryRocker WHO ARE YA? WHO ARE YA?
@YungSethRogen @josswhedon's Astonishing X-Men is also great. Wolverine Origins is really good if you're not a stickler for canon.
@YungSethRogen Read @kellysue's Avengers Assemble and Captain Marvel. She knows how to tell a story. Then read the current Black Widow.

@R3D_STAR I've only ever visited, but I prefer SD over LA. Feels more livable. Tigers will be in your town on Friday though!
@R3D_STAR Nah. We're up 6-3 on the Dodgers though. I take it you're from SD not LA?
@R3D_STAR It's baseball season and my team is doing good! Haha
@R3D_STAR Is it because you need to take your mind off of Baseball and the Tigers invading your space?
@AlecLongstreth The MI Pinball Expo is held on campus where I work every year. I wanted to go, but apparently I missed it last weekend :/
@AlecLongstreth Thanks for the recommendations! Any good books out there?
@AlecLongstreth I had no idea. Pinball has such a rich history but I know so little about it.
@AlecLongstreth "FOR AMUSEMENT ONLY" This warning concerns me.

@jasonhohoho I'm just not too pleased with the aforementioned writer in recent years. Great ideas, questionable execution and opinions.
@jasonhohoho Or they couldn't get a refund.
@wearseatbelts Tigers will be there May 30-June 1. Get tickets, I'll fly out.
@wearseatbelts It was about winning a Mariners shirt. <TIGER FACE>
@wearseatbelts I'm not okay with this RT at all.
@jonwahlgren SO jelly of those Punch-Out!! cards.
@SpaceKappa It's a twin size, but friends are always welcome to join!
@SpaceKappa Laying in bed overwhelmed with all of the things I needed to get done yesterday. Now I REALLY need to get them done today.
Being a #ghost is not nearly as exciting as one might expect. #werewolf #webcomic 
@DaveLetcavage SO good.
@DaveLetcavage -_-
Someone's car rolled into the lake at OU today. Apparently no one was inside and everyone is okay, but… 
@SpaceKappa Assuming by "pins" you mean wearable flair, not NES connectors.
@SpaceKappa Plz send pins my way. Also, if you're thinking of having stickers made, I'd recommend 
@crumpledpapyrus @ConorMcMahon64 Jelly Baby sounds like a terrible Pokemon.
@DaveLetcavage -_-
@DaveLetcavage Only if you buy me the iPad!
@ataraxia_status No balloon floor. Omw.
@ataraxia_status Is it actually called that. Also, this: 
@ataraxia_status Need bananas?
@ataraxia_status Sure. I'll bring 9x2 cherries and peaches, 9 lychees, 9 apples, 9 lemons, and 9 durians. 8x9. Good?
@ataraxia_status Give me a few. Just loading up. I'll see what I can grab.
@ataraxia_status Any fruit you're looking for in particular?
@SpaceKappa 
@SpaceKappa Video of you in a tux?
@SpaceKappa What do you have in mind? I'm not the best, but I'm always up for a challenge.
What are the opinions on reading comics on an iPad mini? Thinking about going digital. #comics @comiXology
@jennyowenyoungs I've noticed this too. Still waiting for the day when I'm actually searching for feet pics.
@ataraxia_status @dbastedo Who is "Squarewheel" and why is s/he stealing my precious arts?
Self-portrait, 2014. 
@ataraxia_status Easy there, tiger. I appreciate the offer, but can't make it tonight.
@Zen_Burden Sup, grl?
@SpaceKappa You haven't missed much. Still a cesspool here. Glad to have you back.
@nonoisechitchat @daveletcavage We got no food, we got no money, and our pets heads are falling off! Haaaaaaarry!
@nonoisechitchat @daveletcavage Good Morning, oh in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight!
@DaveLetcavage Smokin!
@DaveLetcavage Bro. I'm itchin'
@NoNoiseChitChat Mostly Predator references.
@lisadraws Where? I've been trying to book for months :(
@ataraxia_status It is strange, but I sometimes find myself obsessing about my own activities/how long I take now too.
@johnwhanley Sounds like that student was Hemmingway and hawingway through the assignment. Amiright?
@ataraxia_status How are you on Twitter 24/7?
@ataraxia_status Regular 3DS power button is square.
@ataraxia_status lol. It's cool. Was really just curious. I just noticed them.
@CoryRocker @ataraxia_status Did someone plant trees in my town? #ACNL
This week I review a very old, very bad, NES game: “@nintendolife: Review: Volleyball (Wii U eShop) 
Really happy with my current pull. It's a great time to be reading #comics. #comicbooks #Marvel… 
@SpaceKappa I tried it in July, so idk if that was the newest out. Definitely wroth checking out though.
@SpaceKappa I watched a guy using OR on a treadmill thing and a fake gun playing an FPS. It was really impressive.
@SpaceKappa Actually, I remember the display being surprisingly low-res. Still pretty neat though.
@SpaceKappa freaky in a "our future might actually be a bleak technological wasteland" way.
@SpaceKappa it's freaky.
@VinSpee @aaronrbond Just found a dead earwig in a box at work. Reminded me of the good old days in Auburn Hills.
@jesseburchett I'll have to check it out. Baumbach is hit or miss with me too. I want to like him, but he doesn't always deliver.
@jesseburchett I can't stand Greta.
@R3D_STAR I kind of hate the lead character, but I might pick up a PS4 for this.
@ataraxia_status There's usually more stuff buried after a rain as well.
@ataraxia_status Your house is so bright!
@ataraxia_status Lots of rare fish on the island. Some depend of season as well.
@ataraxia_status looking for a Spinosaurus tail.
@ataraxia_status I need to find a list of all the Nintendo stuff and see what I have/need. Also, 1 fossil away from completion.
@ataraxia_status Sounds good. Thanks for the balance board!
@ataraxia_status hahaha. Did you want to come back and grab more?
@ataraxia_status I see.
@ataraxia_status All set. Want me to end the session?
@ataraxia_status Lol. Thanks. It's a mess, but I have some sweet Ninty stuff.
@ataraxia_status As a precaution. I've lost stuff when I didn't save before people left.
@ataraxia_status Sounds good. Let me know so I can save before you take off.
@ataraxia_status Want my slingshot?
@ataraxia_status Sure, I don't have that yet. Feel free to leave it by the train station. My gate is open.
@ataraxia_status I actually just stopped playing. I can open back up if you want to run around and grab fruit, but I have to do other stuff.
@ataraxia_status Bowing to my greatness? Just added.
@ataraxia_status Actually, you did not give me enough digits.
@ataraxia_status Tons of bells from the island. Adding your FC right now.
@ataraxia_status Not too bad!
@ataraxia_status how much was it?
@ataraxia_status what is your native fruit?
@ataraxia_status I can't hop out though. Game won't let me suspend with visitors.
@ataraxia_status Shoot. Can't suspend software while playing online. I'll get back to you.
@ataraxia_status my gate is currently open.
@CoryRocker I'm awake. Want me to open my gate?
@CoryRocker That's so rough :/ I'm free all day tomorrow if you need anything!
@coryrocker Facebook messaging you now.
@coryrocker Actually, I'm physically at work but I'm done for the day. Give me a few and I'll open my gates.
@CoryRocker AT WORK, BRO.
@ataraxia_status You posted the actual video the other day, but have you seen this? 
@Zen_Burden That's the dream.
@holliebuckets Thank you!
@Zen_Burden Right?! It's like a tattoo, but in stone.
I recently drew this for a garden club and now it's permanently etched in stone. Such a cool honor! 
@ephish Was this an actual Lost World ad? Hahaha
@ataraxia_status Very interested. Also, golden tool requirements: 
@ataraxia_status They also determine your appearance. You could write a thesis on that alone.
@ataraxia_status I'd be more inclined to believe 500k, unless you spend an absurd amount of time fishing. Max of 5 fossils appear per day.
@ataraxia_status what is considered "perfect"?
@ataraxia_status Having fruit from other towns will get you hella bells. Great help for early in the game.
@ataraxia_status Keep on Truckin. And I can't remember if you can visit other towns that early in the game. If you can, let me know.
@ataraxia_status Your rating goes up by helping people around town and paying off your home loan. It'll be a few days before you're 100%
@ataraxia_status Literally public works projects (think government irl). Talk to Isabelle about your approval rating. 
@ataraxia_status You know the drill. A lot more is dependent on you being an active mayor in this one though. Public works projects, etc.
@ataraxia_status The shop might have to upgrade before they stock it. (keep buying stuff and wait a few days).
@ataraxia_status slingshot.
@ataraxia_status I'm probably opening my town for a friend tonight. Feel free to stop by and grab some fruit.
@CoryRocker Let me know if you want fruit. I'm going out for a bit but should be home in a few hours.
@DamienMcFerran You wrote well and care about the things you write about. Clearly you are a threat that must be avoided.
@CoryRocker Let me know if you're playing today and I'll hop on.
@CoryRocker you awake? My acnl town has fruit.
@dazcalvert @jonwahlgren @EMP_TriForce_GM MY GOD. IT'S TRUE! 
@AlecLongstreth Thanks! I already am :)
@AlecLongstreth postcard looks great! I'll definitely be using it to mark my book! 
@kellysue I love Captain Marvel as much as the next reader, but why aren't more people talking about Ghost?! 
@EMP_TriForce_GM @dazcalvert interview that just went live on @nintendolife 
@dazcalvert It's live now, so I can say that I LOVE the @EMP_TriForce_GM interview. It's so genuine. One of the best on the site.
@ataraxia_status are you all caught up now? 
@DaveLetcavage @GazPlant Whoa. That's my EXACT thought on Thor.
@GazPlant @DaveLetcavage I was excited for Thor and was disappointed. It just wasn't exciting or perilous to me.
@SpaceKappa CLEARLY a trap.
@GazPlant @DaveLetcavage Thor's pacing and characterization was absolute garbage. Cap get everything right that Thor got wrong.
@DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 @nintendolife Nonono, you did exactly what I was hoping for! Haha
@DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 @nintendolife I laughed the whole way through. When I read "unboxing" I was hoping you'd go through the meal.
@DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 @nintendolife Pure rage.
@DamienMcFerran @ThomasBW84 @nintendolife Great video! I cried the entire way through.
@antdickens I keep thinking caps is on. It never is.
@TheSwellers @bensears Not trying to stir up trouble or anything, if that's what it seems like. I just thought it was strange.
@bensears @TheSwellers I'm sure it's there, but I was hoping to find the name outside of the physical product.
@TheSwellers @bensears Couldn't find it on album or shirt product pages, or when I searched "Swellers Light Under Closed Doors Album Art".
@TheSwellers @bensears Thank you! Question 2: why isn't this information more readily available?
@TheSwellers Who did the album art on The Light Under Closed Doors? Can't find it listed anywhere online.
Photoset: My posting schedule on this blog is maddeningly inconsistent. The good news is that today I drew... 
@nintendolife @NintendoAmerica Got my new Club Nintendo #acnl pouch today. Perfect fit for my #3DSXL! 
Everyone: It's St. Paddy's Day. Have fun tonight, but please do not destroy each other.
@SpaceKappa I hope you get mani more!
@SpaceKappa my joke was bad. I'd say your assessment really hit the nail on the head.
@SpaceKappa BORROW MINE, I HAVE TWO. 
@robertashley I think if something has influence, it's important. In that sense, wouldn't cheap guitars be just as influential as the music?
@robertashley I think it's more about a piece of music being important in terms of its genre, not just based on the music itself.
@robertashley I'd consider music that advances a genre or creates a new one to be important. Not necessarily more important than others.
@SpaceKappa It's not in perfect condition, but it's everything. 
@SpaceKappa If you're still interested, let me know. If not, no biggie.
@SpaceKappa Found it. 
@ConorMcMahon64 This makes me want a cig.
@antdickens Your desk-mate drinks a lot of soda!
@DaveLetcavage Not worth the frustration, brother.
@DaveLetcavage Never read the comments.
I recently reviewed a terrible, terrible retro game: “@nintendolife: Review: Renegade (Wii U eShop) 
A very old man just complimented my beard. Today has been solid.
@DaveLetcavage My friends @JetRodBand opened for @sleepysunmusic
@DaveLetcavage That was my second guess. You'd probably be standing on the sound board at St. Andrews from that angle.
@DaveLetcavage You at St. Andrew's? I was at the Shelter last night.
Apparently someone in Vietnam is reading my #webcomic. That's pretty rad. Are you reading it? 
@NintendoForce @lucasmthomas All right. Will do.
@NintendoForce I'd rather handle this via email. Who should I get in touch with? @lucasmthomas?
@NintendoForce Properly credit artists and contributors after being reminded twice.
@ConorMcMahon64 Very true! I was surprised by how much I laughed at this one.
@StephenKelly180 @nintendolife I DARE YOU.
@StephenKelly180 @nintendolife I'd say go for it. It's really bizarre and it made me smile a whole lot.
A very late review of a very good game: “@nintendolife: Review: Weapon Shop De Omasse (3DS eShop) 
@sam3214 Mazzucchelli's Batman is easily my favorite. I think I have those books buried in my basement.
@LadyStarstorm @SpaceKappa This is really adorable.
@SpaceKappa I have a deeper appreciation for and understanding of my own relationships at this age. It's easier to connect.
@SpaceKappa No shame, brother. I'm finding that I cry more over games/movies/TV shows as I get older. I think it means that we care.
@dudey300 @ConorMcMahon64 @CoryRocker @superconsole Drunk WarioWare is excellent as well.
@dudey300 @ConorMcMahon64 @CoryRocker @superconsole Ever play Mario Kart Drink and Drive?
@ConorMcMahon64 @dudey300 @CoryRocker @superconsole Did you play Beer Pong too? Another classic red cup game.
@ConorMcMahon64 @dudey300 @CoryRocker @superconsole HAHAHA! That's awesome! I want to go to a US party.
@dudey300 @CoryRocker @superconsole or anyone else outside the States. Can you confirm this is real? 
Noticed this for the first time at my dentist's office. What year is this? #N64 #1996 
@DamienMcFerran Is this a photo of Gabe or a digital painting? 
@MegaWatts64 Still a great game, but not allowing me to play with others before shelling out is criminal.
@MegaWatts64 Re: DLC. I bought Saints Row 2 years ago to play with a friend but we couldn't play online because we didn't have the same DLC.
@SpaceKappa Consolize me, Captain!
@CoryRocker @nintendolife @antdickens All of the NL staffers named after private parts were born in March.
@johnwhanley You'll dig this. 
@HotlineMiami Probably. I wouldn't be happy about it though.
@wearseatbelts I'm on my third run through too! I think I watched that episode last night, so it was fresh on my mind.
@wearseatbelts Nope. I'm just pathetic :P
@wearseatbelts You should be creeped out by my completely worthless ability to identify TV shows with a single blurry still.
@wearseatbelts "The Gang Recycles Their Trash." Right?
@ataraxia_status Doge, plz. DJjAnNPHx2RdsKXW1rwxn2ouvuSMH3T7WZ
@lisadraws Sweet prolapse, bro.
@JoshRadnor Drunk Ted spotted wearing @YesthisisSOL tee. All of my favorite things.
@wearseatbelts Booooooo
@DamienMcFerran Was this a "let's save them just in case we need one" situation?
Being the only person at the airport in the early morning is entirely surreal. 
@forlornfunnies I was there about two days ago. I need to start planning my trips better.
@ataraxia_status Right on. Keep me posted.
@ataraxia_status March?
@ataraxia_status Well, good luck. Maybe I'll catch you next time you're in MI.
@ataraxia_status No worries. Just figured I'd throw it out there. What's in SF?
@ataraxia_status Yeah, West Hollywood. I have to be at the airport around 4 though.
@ataraxia_status Where you at?
@GazPlant I don't think they were selling burgers. It smelled Greek. And it has been a while, but now I think of you when I see them. Haha
@mnemosynekurai Kirby's Pinball Land. Available on 3DS VC. Do it.
@grrrreatdane @wheatpond @ataraxia_status @pixxelporntwit What's happening now?
@DaveLetcavage I don't really have a plan. Just hanging out today and tomorrow before heading to Vegas to meet up with @NoNoiseChitChat
@DaveLetcavage I'm actually just visiting a friend. About to go see @TeamCoco record.
@DaveLetcavage Taking pics of food trucks and sending them to @GazPlant
@GazPlant Food truck in LA. 
@wearseatbelts Damn.
@ataraxia_status I have a wallet though. I just don't have my computer with me so I don't know my number. Is dogevault just another wallet?
@ataraxia_status I do, but I have no clue what it is right now. Use @tipdoge ?
@ataraxia_status Search "Comicalamities" and you'll find the whole short.
@ataraxia_status Excellent. Also, no animator information, but here's the source: 
@ataraxia_status Haha. If you cut your hair or something just let me know. We can always update or.
@ataraxia_status It was Sullivan's studio based on how old it is, but I couldn't tell you the exact animator. Most likely Messmer.
@ataraxia_status Nope. Been this for as long as I can remember. And I don't know too much about Felix. 
@ataraxia_status Felix the Cat?
@NoNoiseChitChat #ALFonthestrip
@jonwahlgren I'm also not changing my wardrobe, so I'm kinda stuck with it.
@jonwahlgren I hate this so much.
I'm trying to get around the West Coast. Sign up for @Uber using my promo code to help me not spend all of my money! 
@mouseguard Is that this weekend? I forget every year. They are the absolute worst at advertising.
@CoryRocker @jonwahlgren @DaveLetcavage @antdickens @ThomasBW84 You could do something naughty with "Whitehead" as well.
@CoryRocker @jonwahlgren @DaveLetcavage You nailed mind.
@jonwahlgren @DaveLetcavage @antdickens Pronounce "DelVillano."
I just returned a lost dog to its owner and now I'm eating a chicken sandwich and thinking that sometimes life is cool.
@ataraxia_status I'll be staying in West Hollywood for a few days.
@ataraxia_status Want to get lunch on Tuesday?
@Irishmile @rainnwilson @shaner528 It was in 2008. 
@dazcalvert @ThomasBW84 The year of NO RETAIL.
@benspants Me too. We might be the only ones, and that's okay.
@odnetnin @spacekappa I do love that show.
@spacekappa Me too. I love P&amp;R. Just looking for a copy.
@spacekappa Neither do I and it's bumming me out.
@SpaceKappa Do you happen to have Pocky and Rocky with Becky for GBA?
@kevinkieninger @VinSpee @aaronrbond SEE YOU ON THE TRACKS 
@superconsole I'm not sure how sarcastic these tweets are meant to be, but they're all pretty funny.
@forlornfunnies I feel drunk when watching these. I'd love to somehow be involved.
@daveletcavage @gazplant What else is new?
@daveletcavage Never played it!
@DaveLetcavage <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@DaveLetcavage Did you get an advance copy?
@gazplant Basing it around the date of the awards is really bizarre.
@gazplant Ah, right. Probably wasn't time for an Academy screening.
@gazplant Wide UK release was two days ago, but didn't you see it last week? Based on BAFTA rules, I assume it's a 2013 film.
@gazplant Fair enough, but here's your answer. Scroll down to "What makes a film eligible?" 
@GazPlant I know that, but it's probably not based on wide release. I'm sure some British cinemas were showing both in 2013.
@GazPlant Both of those came out in 2013.
@ThomasBW84 Never read the comments on your own articles, Tom. It doesn't help anyone.
@CoryRocker You're really passionate about this and it bums me out that I have no idea what you're talking about.
A review I wrote about a good game based on a great movie: “@nintendolife: Review: The LEGO Movie Videogame 
@ThomasBW84 @ConorMcMahon64 @antdickens We're crazy? YOU'RE the one who completed Golden Abyss.
@ConorMcMahon64 @ThomasBW84 @antdickens #journalism
@ConorMcMahon64 @ThomasBW84 @antdickens a podcast in which we talk about games we haven't played, but I may have checked out the demo.
@ThomasBW84 @ConorMcMahon64 I played the demo and it didn't really grab me. Cute and fun, but not for me.
@ThomasBW84 @ConorMcMahon64 Balancing the console to walk across logs made me want to die.
@ThomasBW84 @ConorMcMahon64 It felt to me like an expensive tech demo.
@wearseatbelts I don't think so? DM me. I'll be in town from Feb 21-24.
Seattle friends, I'm coming to visit next weekend. Let's grab a beer.
@wearseatbelts That was actually the first thing that came to mind!
@wearseatbelts All day, every day.
@vinspee @kevinkieninger I can't argue with the logic. That might be what I do this weekend.
@vinspee @kevinkieninger And I were just talking about this. I still haven't watched S01.
It's Valentine's Day so I'm going to eat an entire pizza by myself and watch Pacific Rim. Ladies?
A review I wrote about a remade old flash game: “@nintendolife: Review: Castle Clout 3D (3DS eShop) 
@GazPlant If you haven't already seen it, you'll appreciate this: 
@AlecLongstreth Awesome! Thanks for letting me know! Again, the book is top-notch. Looking forward to digging in tomorrow.
@DaveLetcavage What did @NoNoiseChitChat do this time?
@AlecLongstreth Book arrived today. Absolutely gorgeous. Were the postcards sent separate? 
@spacekappa I just started loling.
Some guy at work is wearing Google Glass and I can't stop laughing at his stupid face.
@GlennHowerton @RMcElhenney Did the gang kill Nikki Potnick when they crashed her car?
@nintendolife And the award for "Creepiest Article Title" goes to…
@ataraxia_status Thank you, sir. I actually found and purchased it earlier today ;)
@forlornfunnies On Moleskine paper, if I'm remember correctly? I have a planner with Tomoe River paper. It does not absorb ink well.
@NoNoiseChitChat @nintendolife "Nintendo characters we love to love, but also those who we hate to love and love to hate hating."
@forlornfunnies Does the ink from that Pilot dry quickly on the page?
@ChrisTheHoff pretty sure @MrBozon mentioned it being tied up at SDCC.
@dazcalvert @DamienMcFerran Am I the only one who cried at The Lego Movie?
@CoryRocker Introduce her to Peggle.
@jesseburchett You sold her a beat-em-up?
@CoryRocker That's absurd. I can check mine when I get home. Unless mine has been posting to MiiVerse without my knowing. Haha.
@ConorMcMahon64 @nintendolife "Brilliant and delightfully vain." That describes me perfectly!
@nintendolife We should release a calendar at the end of the year featuring these pics.
@CoryRocker I'm pretty sure I just told it not to post when I set the game up. Nothing in Settings?
@SpaceKappa You've clearly never seen this video: 
Photoset: Biological Studies. 
@ataraxia_status what was that public transit app you were hyping recently?
@antdickens @CoryRocker My snark comes from a place of love. @ThomasBW84 can verify as he gets the brunt of it.
@NoNoiseChitChat @ThomasBW84 "Top 10 romantic PornHub comments posted by Nintendo characters."
Photoset: I drew this a few months back but never did anything with it. It’s about loss or letting go or... 
@jonwahlgren Ask him why he's so thoughtless. 
I have some exceptionally rude neighbors. #acnl 
@ThomasBW84 I ended up buying MH3U on both consoles. It's dope.
@dazcalvert Someone has to keep games journalism sexy.
@dazcalvert Just kidding! You're stuck with me! Love ya, buddy!
@dazcalvert Check your inbox for my letter of resignation and a pic of my ass.
Here it is, folks. The review you've been waiting for: “@nintendolife: Review: Barbie Dreamhouse Party (Wii U) 
@antdickens I'm so sorry to hear that. I could be a king.
@daveletcavage Well, I'd recommend it. I enjoy beat 'em ups, and DC is a fun and gorgeous one.
@daveletcavage There's a lot to do, and going through with each character obviously increases the play time.
@daveletcavage That depends on what you call "complete." Take a look at this: 
@DaveLetcavage Vita. Got that one physical though.
@DaveLetcavage I get that. PSN accounts make it easy to delete and redownload games when you want to play though. I have a 16gb card.
@SpaceKappa I enjoy the LEGO games, but I LOVED that one.
@SpaceKappa How many Sam Jackson movie references have you found? Because I laughed every single time.
@DaveLetcavage I think this goes back to our previous conversation about going digital. Great stuff on PSN!
@VinSpee good different?
Just a reminder that Woody Allen is an actual monster: 
@EllenPage Twitter is just trying to save you some characters! Thanks, Twitter!
@coryrocker Glad you liked it! I felt good about that one.
@coryrocker The one in which I look like I'm near death? Just some jazz on the radio.
@ThomasBW84 Welcome to the team! All 15 of us Vita owners hold monthly meetings and you're more than welcome to join!
@SpaceKappa I just saw that it's 30 here and I got unreasonably excited. Might go for a swim!
Saw that coming from a mile away. #slytherin #pottermore 
@zipmon @SpaceKappa You are not being so wonderful right now, Momo.
@zipmon @SpaceKappa Is it on there? Internet says the original game was only released in Japan.
@SpaceKappa @zipmon I don't believe you, Joe. I don't believe you didn't know something about a retro game.
@zipmon @WayForward Side-scrolling beat-em-up?! That's my favorite genre!
@zipmon Honestly, I have no clue what it is, but I love @WayForward.
@zipmon Momo! They're making a game about you! 
@dazcalvert @pushsquare @ShogunRok Who would win in a fight, my grandfather or a fit, young black belt?
@SpaceKappa That is frightening.
@GazPlant @SpaceKappa Eh, I actually enjoy it live, but watching on television is just as boring as American Football to me.
@GazPlant @SpaceKappa I don't like football either. I also think "soccer" is boring to watch.
@antdickens @CoryRocker Just don't Google image search his name. It's all nsfw.
@antdickens @CoryRocker That sounds pretty awesome. Have fun! Bring me back something nice!
@CoryRocker @antdickens It's true. He's been sending me saucy in-bed pics.
@antdickens Fair enough. New question: why are you in Singapore for Chinese New Year? Just vacationing? @CoryRocker GO TO BED.
@antdickens What are you doing in China? @CoryRocker GO TO BED.
@mnemosynekurai Ah. Spooky evening music. Got it!
@jonwahlgren @Dan_Adelman Magic man indeed.
@jonwahlgren It would probably play exactly like the PS3 version with option for Vita controls. I'd be on-board for that.
@jonwahlgren You sure about your laptop? It's not very taxing. And console version is good, but I preferred the speed of using a mouse.
@mnemosynekurai I recognize the background music but I can't place it and it's hurting my brain.
@jonwahlgren I would recommend getting it on Steam. It's made for mouse+keys.
@jonwahlgren Nbd. Just a fun game.
@jonwahlgren Completely forgot about that. Can you now kill with doors?
@jonwahlgren Are those the HM pins I told you to snag at some event months ago?
@ThomasBW84 @NoNoiseChitChat @nintendolife Our poor, poor readers.
@CoryRocker haha. Which was this in response to?
@coryrocker I've played with it, but nothing serious. I almost always have my phone on me though.
@coryrocker I guess the GamePad would make a difference. Navigating a browser with a PS controller though? No thanks!
@coryrocker I didn't mean for that to sound rude, I just feel like a home console is the worst choice for web browsing.
@CoryRocker Why are you browsing the internet on your gaming console? I'm assuming you're tweeting from a smart phone?
Tired life living. #sundaysketch 
@johnwhanley I think it's more about station than age. Cursing reminds the kids that you're human. We like that.
@johnwhanley I knew what you meant. I used to do this. I just thought your reaction to the loud German was hilarious.
@dudey300 @CoryRocker This seems legitimate!
@SpaceKappa Custom plushies of your own Mii.
@CoryRocker @antdickens Wake me up when they announce Fallout 4 or a new TimeSplitters.
@CoryRocker I really want to play tomb Raider, but I don't want to pay for it again. Waiting for that "killer app" (Besides Netflix).
@CoryRocker Honestly, I won't be too surprised if it's cancelled. I'm about ready to invest in a PS4 anyway.
@CoryRocker Too busy mourning the death of Nintendo? Nintendo Fusion is coming like next week though. Chin up!
@CoryRocker I thought they uncancelled Watch_DogZ?
@nintendolife I may be biased, but @ThomasBW84 is one of a very few writers on the web whose work has me at a constant chuckle.
@DaveLetcavage @zipmon GET IN HERE, DAVE.
@zipmon I joined your game from my friends list! Haha.
@antdickens @GazPlant Turtlejizz? Is that a thing people are saying now? I hope it is!
@ConorMcMahon64 I'm... Having an off day.

@ThomasBW84 I'm ready to handle your ass! I mean hand you. HAND YOU.
@damienmcferran @dazcalvert @megawatts64 I'm expecting a @pushsquare review shortly.
@DamienMcFerran @dazcalvert @MegaWatts64 Serious question: Any of you ever play this? There was no NA release. 
@johnwhanley The first in a series I call "John Hanley loses his mind." Stay tuned.
@SpaceKappa @RWTVSecrets Hopefully it's not one of those situations where they're asking you to prom on a dare from their friends.
@SpaceKappa @RWTVSecrets Look at you, Mr. Popular!
@ThomasBW84 Nintendo Fusion stabilized?
@pixelpowa I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said that there's literally no proof that it's happening right now.
@pixelpowa We've all been joking about this. There is absolutely no reason to believe any of it.
Might seem petty, but this is very important: “@ComicsGrid: Dear Journalists: please repeat after Bart... @guardian 
@SpaceKappa I really just want to play Metal Slug with a stick in the comfort of my own home. Is that too much to ask?!
@SpaceKappa 2. That $5 fightstick is not as nice as my Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom one. Neither result is surprising.
@SpaceKappa After much research, I have found two things: 1. A fightstick does not provide a satisfying "arcade" experience with VC games.
@SpaceKappa I have tomorrow off work. I'll dedicate it to researching fightsticks and then never doing anything with my findings. Haha.
@SpaceKappa No worries. Like I said, I just got it to test. Might dig out my other stick later and try a few games, see where the issue is.
@SpaceKappa That's why I'm wondering if this one was just made poorly with a weird directional override.
@SpaceKappa Bought it new and just opened the back. It's clean. I remember my TvC fightstick working fine with VC games.
@SpaceKappa It has trouble reacting accurately unless the stick's position is precise. Wondering if one direction cancels/overrides another.
@SpaceKappa I picked this up for $5 to experiment. Stick is four-way digital and does not work well with NES games. 
@SpaceKappa Also, does a modern fightstick take four directions and use them to simulate eight, or does it have more directions to hit?
@SpaceKappa But does it read eight, or does it simulate eight?
@SpaceKappa How much do you know about the SNES D-Pad?
@DamienMcFerran @SpaceKappa @nintendolife What's the best fighter available for Wii U VC right now? I need to know for SCIENCE.
@ThomasBW84 NINTENDO FUSION CONFIRMED: “@NintendoAmerica: Pokémon Bank has launched in certain Asian countries. (1/2)”
@VinSpee @kevinkieninger @aaronrbond @danifahs Hey guys, I need a loan.
@ThomasBW84 I just realized this is mostly based off of a domain purchase made 11 years ago. That's incredible.
He nailed it! “@NoNoiseChitChat: I'm trying to come up with a joke about using Twitter while on the shitter, but I don't want to force it.”
@ThomasBW84 If you have your salt ready, a GameStop employee told me yesterday that Mario Kart 8 is street dated for April 1.
@ThomasBW84 I thought Nintendo was going 3rd party? Developing for smart phones and OUYA?
@ThomasBW84 No subtweeting. Who are we calling out?
@NoNoiseChitChat Thank goodness you're here.
@vinspee I look at Google for fun to see where visits are coming from, but the numbers are all off.
@vinspee I have Google set up, but it's screwy because it's on tumblr. Followers don't actually hit the page, the comic is in their feed.
@VinSpee If I could just get about 10,000 more people to care then I'd be all set!
Today is the 500th consecutive day that I've updated my webcomic, Duane, Average High School Werewolf.… 
@DaveLetcavage I thought some parts were entertaining (mostly the soundtrack). Gameplay was rough though.
Photoset: I posted this on Instagram yesterday, but I wanted to share it here as well. I tried the same... 
@ThomasBW84 I'm finding that some stages are on point, but the ones that don't work so well are absolute torture.
@ThomasBW84 Getting ready to torture myself. 
@DaveLetcavage @CoryRocker It literally gave me vertigo. Couldn't walk straight for two days.
Another thing I wrote on the internet: “@nintendolife: Review: Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver (Wii U) 
@SpaceKappa @LadyStarstorm Don't feel bad! Your relationship outlived it! A WINNER IS YOU.

@DamienMcFerran @SpaceKappa Imagine his reaction if he had bought a Virtual Boy at launch.

@antdickens @MegaWatts64 And that's the sad story of how the N64 changed my life and taught me to be more independent as a kid.
@antdickens @MegaWatts64 Finally got that Racer bundle and stopped taking my parents' advice on things they know nothing about.
@antdickens @MegaWatts64 Parents got me a Genesis as all of my friends were playing N64. I spent the next few years saving money for one.
@antdickens @MegaWatts64 Grew up with an SNES but when the N64 launched my mom convinced me that I wanted a Genesis instead.
@antdickens @MegaWatts64 I got the SW E 1: Racer bundle when I finally got an N64 late in the game. Loved it.
@MegaWatts64 You. Always you.
@ThomasBW84 I understood it and I laughed. Don't ever compromise. #pooptweet

There's still time to enter and win the Zelda guide Box Set from @primagames over at @nintendolife! Get on that! 
@CoryRocker Well done, kid.
@jonwahlgren I use @gandibar. A little more expensive, but worth it for the fantastic customer support.
Classic DelVillanos. 
@antdickens @MegaWatts64 That one was sealed, but I couldn't imagine it selling for that much.
@DaveLetcavage Yep, it was there. And no Astro Boy. Sorry!
@MegaWatts64 Please tell me that $299.99 USD is completely unreasonable for this. 
@GazPlant I'm pretty sure you can use it for single. You might have to trick the game, but I remember doing it.
@benspants because that's the name of the Garfield sequel?
@GazPlant You can already play Lego Marvel with the Pro Controller.
@SpaceKappa It's an amazing thing going to a steady job after working erratic part-time hours. Good luck!
@SpaceKappa I work at a University. Holidays and weekends off like you wouldn't believe.
@DaveLetcavage Sounds good to me! I'll keep you posted.
@DaveLetcavage Yeah, I like it a lot. What are you looking to spend if I find one?
@DaveLetcavage Found it! 
@ChrisTheHoff That's how I felt about Altered Beast. I'm almost certain the 3D rerelease is the Genesis game, but I'm enjoying it anyway.
@DaveLetcavage Want me to check for anything for you?
@DaveLetcavage I just realized that this place is &lt;1 mile from my house and I've never been. Maybe tomorrow!
@DaveLetcavage I'm not a HUGE collector, so I just casually but cool old games when I see them. No store specifically.
@ChrisTheHoff Oof. I can't stand Ecco. I'm not entirely convinced with Galaxy Force II either, but I've also never played it.
@ChrisTheHoff I already grabbed four. Might DL another one or two tonight. They did great work with these.
Haven't posted one in a while, but here's a #sundaysketch. I draw a lot of self-portraits because I… 
@DaveLetcavage Which shop?
@GazPlant Pretty cheap. Keep me posted.
Happy winter solstice, everyone! The one day each year that we set aside our differences and listen to… 
@GazPlant Send me a link to the product you want.
@GazPlant I really do 't know. But if you figure that all out and send me the money, I'd gladly do it for you.
@GazPlant send a link and paypal me the money.
@SpaceKappa That's pretty rad. I like fightsticks, just not great at fighting games. I tend to use them for more arcade titles.
@SpaceKappa Ah. Too bad. I'm curious, but I can wait ;)
@SpaceKappa Let's see the custom faceplate!
@dudey300 rdelvillano. I send mostly pics of my dog and people smoking outside my office window.
@CoryRocker Cocker? I hardly know 'er! Do you hear that one daily?
@zipmon I got nothing at all :(
@R3D_STAR I laughed for far too long when I was introduced to that.
@R3D_STAR if you haven't seen this already, then you're welcome in advance: 
@CoryRocker one might say that it's Super...Bad. Dohoho!
@CoryRocker It was the same writer/director from Superbad. Also, American marketing. 
@CoryRocker A lot of people didn't like it because they were expecting Superbad. I was pleasantly surprised.
@CoryRocker One of my favorite films. She's great in it!
@trintran I did the exact same thing tonight and got no out of state hits. What gives?!
@zacgormania Sure? They're only doing half tables this year, right?
@CoryRocker @SpaceKappa I'm a big fan of MK2. Raiden was solid.
@SpaceKappa I would say that 64 had easily the best multiplayer options, so there's that.
@SpaceKappa Come on, man. Mario Kart DS was solid.

@drafthousefilms If I place a domestic order from your online store today, do you think it would arrive before the 25th?
@jonwahlgren If it was a rotating thing, then I would probably subscribe for quite a while. Like Sega Channel.

@superconsole @dudey300 Or this: 
@dudey300 @superconsole There you go! Katy beat me to it.
@dudey300 I know. Haha. But are you replying to someone with whom you share romantic feelings, or is it, say, your mom? We need context!
@SpaceKappa Not at all. I grabbed two just in case someone else wanted one. It's all yours.
@dudey300 Exactly.
@dudey300 I don't understand the context.
@SpaceKappa DM me your address again and I'll send it out. Happy christmahanakwanzika.
@SpaceKappa I have an extra Club Nintendo charging cradle if you want it. It's white.

@DaveLetcavage LOL. Yep, I remember that too.
@zipmon @SpaceKappa Sometimes we get to do really cool stuff.
@SpaceKappa Fair enough, but it's a pretty general term at this point. The New Avengers is a pretty cool series as well.
@SpaceKappa World War Hulk is really cool. Also, "collected works" are referred to as "trade paperbacks" or "trades."
@benspants Great use of the SOAD song. Haven't heard that in a while.

@zipmon Are these all crazy expensive in USD, or am I converting incorrectly?
@zipmon what is this planner and where can I buy one?
@zipmon Very true. I've dropped my XL on my face at least once.
@zipmon I don't love any of them though. Maybe that Luigi 2DS as a collector's piece, but I might just get a black XL.
@zipmon @coryrocker @gazplant To be fair, my issue could be my XL. She's not looking too good these days.
@CoryRocker @gazplant Assuming we're talking 3DS, my 32 gb Sandisk fails on me about 25% of the time.
@ChrisTheHoff You're not making this easy for me to be lazy. I still need to catch up on Layton too.
@ChrisTheHoff Fair enough. The older ones aren't so easy to come by anymore. Might start here anyway.

No, really.
@DamienMcFerran Man, it looks so good in white. I wish we got that model in NA.
In today's webcomic we joke about Candy Corn. Because it's gross. 
@GazPlant We're good. Just keep in mind that Twitter is very public.
@GazPlant That's fine. You probably don't need to understand it. But I don't appreciate your getting on a public forum to "laugh at America"
@GazPlant That's not how it works. It's a political move. The "shutdown" will be over very soon.
