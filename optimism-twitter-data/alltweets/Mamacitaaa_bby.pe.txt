Taking just a couple minutes out of your day to ask if someone is alright and give them a hug can make that persons day
We haven't talked in years but he still cares.He really is such a sweet boy and I wish more people realized this.
Out of his day to see if I was alright when I was sitting in the hallway alone crying.That made me happy.
I've known this boy Duncan since elementary school, we never talked much, but today he was the first person to stop and take a few minutes
Not all people are heartless and that gives me hope:-)
I'm not giving up but I'm taking a breather.I need to reevaluate some things before I can try again.
I tried my best.
I'm so drained and empty.I ache.I fought and fought but it wasn't enough I guess.
