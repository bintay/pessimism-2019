@RebeccaHerber44 nothing to do with Mr grove. Mums maiden name Herbert, and gran and cousins daughter Isobella! Nice coincidence :-) <BLACK HEART SUIT>
@rouseuk make it your mission for next week vodka irn bru! Of course I have the sugar free stuff!
@rouseuk anyway nice to communicate! Here's what I'm normally like on a Saturday night! ;-) :-) <BLACK HEART SUIT>good Scottish drinkx 
@rouseuk mmm agree to disagree just can't believe and find it hard to know more about your background and your believes now!<BLACK HEART SUIT>
@rouseuk yeah but things like this are always the biggest story when it happens in Scotland!
@rouseuk that's totally personal can't link that with politics.... Just shit ppl!<BLACK HEART SUIT>
@rouseuk @scottg984 @traquir ITV news 7 seconds headline and less than a minute reporting!!!
@rouseuk @scottg984 @traquir very honest I don't understand though your saviours could have been anyone? NHS saved dad, Tories privatise??
@rouseuk @scottg984 @traquir OK no problem see we are not all mad left wing terrorists ;-) <BLACK HEART SUIT>
@rouseuk @traquir let's see how BBC broadcast?not joking coverage of things happenin in Scotland r either ignored or blown out of proportion
@traquir @rouseuk haha! Not quite yet!
@traquir @rouseuk  exactly!!! Ohhh i live in a scheme as well aarrgghhh! No room to swing a cat in my kitchen!!
@rouseuk @traquir we don't all have sky TV! Also highlights police injuries and not why ppl are so moved they are protesting 22.25 BBC news?
@rouseuk @traquir so why didn't they give Scotland's chaos the same respect was reported Main BBC news about 20 ppl Jim Murphy Eddie izzard?
@rescuedogdexter @charnicafu  following and will ask daughter who did spanish at school what to say in some tweets!! 
@Mylegalforum only thing I've seen is tab on bottom of sky news saying police have been injured!!! I can't believe how much SM informs ??!!!
@rouseuk @traquir is it really that bad I wouldn't know I've only saw things here on Twitter nothing on MSM does that not tell you somethin
@rouseuk @traquir ppl protesting to show their disapproval at Tory government in charge when more than 60% didn't vote for them.
@nw_nicholas I think it should warn us of sophisticated sexy bald male....temperature may rise among women..granted maybe of a certain age!
@LynnieYankee @thisbear nuthin! Happy, friendly humourous Scots... What's the problem?:-)
@MacBark  yeah dat not normal! Of course you would have won. Neighbour takes dogs for walk n cat follows but no lead!:-)
Please have a look at this petition, it means a lot to me: 
@nw_nicholas  they managed to report Glasgow chaos!!!! No surprise from MSM. 
@shomac28 @StigAbell I agree with the sentiment but this is unforgivable, totally wrong and disrespectful. As we say in Scotland "Nae need".
@CurfewBeagle @BeagleMum78 #ScenesForBean all our love from Millie and the boys. So much part of the family<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT> 
@Raffa2006 @BeagleMum78 aww brilliant to see well done raffa for making the visit<BLACK HEART SUIT>:-)

@ilegal right wing working class - these people don't really exist in Scotland, but England voting against their own interests????
@Boags10 "the wumin from dre-bur-ugh she say yes"! Is this taking fruity Friday too far? 
@BoringOleFart brilliant! Head still a bit fuzzy lack of sleep. I thought mine was being optimistic! Only time I've been happy to loss a bet

@Poppyscot @NicolaSturgeon I've put my money on 48, so bet for 46-50....here's hoping! 
@SillymillieMoo see this cat has not been clever enough to roll in fox poo!<BLACK HEART SUIT>

 
@juliefbevan @BrummieGran what's gonna happen when he says he's too tired for school tomorrow! Good luck with that! Good he's interested:-)
@SillymillyMoo @1_beagle no very clever! Disguised as fox so to get near them they only smell fox poo and not beagle! Or your mum's right!<BLACK HEART SUIT>
@MrSebBT I hope you went in and voted all dogs allowed in polling stations <BLACK HEART SUIT>:-)
@1_beagle @SillymillyMoo is this because you then think you smell like a fox and can then supposedly sneak up on them..hound behaviour? :-)
@DunkynBeagle looking very pretty! <BLACK HEART SUIT>:-)
@RebeccaHerber44 see how keen he is to get up really early to see results! Or would that mean he'll spring up about 5ish!
@SillymillyMoo @1_beagle I have to have spare collars for every time she does it. Loves to wriggle it right up her neck..she loves it though
@SillymillyMoo @1_beagle my Millie loves a roll in the old fox poo too, not quite sure what it was this time though! 
@RealDeniseWelch power lies in not giving her any publicity at all no retweets or quote etc. Then only like minded eejits will listen to her
@DanielGearie @ChrisLawSNP I'm off to do the same before work. :-)
@DanielGearie @ChrisLawSNP tell all you pals to do the same! #SNP
@Mylegalforum thanks for keeping us informed of real impact of Tory austerity on the most vulnerable. eyes opened,SM showing what MSM won't.

@DunkynBeagle I will need to have proper look for mine, bought at Christmas and cost a fortune!
@MrMalky the constant talking over people, totally annoying not to mention interrupting etc. No people skills, unlike @NicolaSturgeon
@charley_beagle look at the difference thin when first arrived. Now head looks too wee for body just like me:-)  BOL 
@charley_beagle we try to avoid getting weighed at vets, were told last time not to put on any more:-(  can always  blame it on girlie op!

@KarBoag hope Reid wasn't like this! 
@RugbyOddjob @davidschneider I'm presuming this ultimately led to all women being given the right to vote?
@ppatricialee are we independent? No so no one has ignored or has the power to ignore the Indy vote. Doesn't stop people still wanting it!
@davidschneider I'm voting because it would be totally disrespectful to the women who fought for our right to vote #suffragette
