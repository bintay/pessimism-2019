@GrubbWVU Ah, there's 3 of us at the moment. Thanks though!
@CMUchips I can't stop watching the Vine of his interview.
Paul Pierce is too damn funny. #icalledgame
@Malik4Play If I was skipping out on E3, we'd hoop and have a dunk contest.
When @Kathryn_Ryan said that, I could only respond with... 
Told @Kathryn_Ryan I'm going to joke too much on our wedding. She responds with, "No you won't. You'll be too overwhelmed with my beauty.
@stephensonmc @thestorialist Congrats guys!


@GoldGloveTV Can not wait for helicopters in that game. I'm a peasant who hates running after dying.
@GearsofWar War Machine. That map &amp; Process are my favorite two maps in the series.
@TaikeinCooper 
@TheRealBIGDOOKY #Photoshopped
@czach1r You have to see this: 
@KlayRule I just threw up a little.
@KlayRule My thoughts:

#1: No idea wtf that is.
#2: No way.
#3: Brilliant.
@KlayRule Give me your top three. 
@KlayRule Twix. Any other candy bar choice is a bad decision.
Dave Chappelle predicted this: 
"Hi Mr. Ja Rule. What are your thoughts on the 2016 election?"

"IT'S MURDAAAAAAAH!" 
Matt Barnes really DGAF. 
Ever want a candy bar so bad that you sift through all the change in your car to scrape up a dollar? Yeah, just did that.
@ShayPomeroy Feels like a lot of the imagination has been taken away from them. I still remember creating so many crazy things with LEGOs.
@EvolveTom That looks great! I wish more companies did this, honestly.
@SMOKEUFOOLS Definitely impressive. Can't believe he fell like that, lol.
Messi hit the defender with soccer's version of the Shamgod. 
@vicious696 Agreed. The previous two guys weren't that bad, honestly. He's just doing way too much.
@vicious696 100% agree. Content looks great, I just can't deal with his moaning/yelling/screaming at every single thing.
@ovfd55 I'm interested in seeing how Goodell balances this one. High-profile player who "likely" did something to gain an advantage.
If Tom Brady receives even a one-game suspension for #DeflateGate, I'll be floored.
@VernNotice Hoop Dreams is a documentary, but it's really good. Worth the watch &amp; on Netflix or Hulu, I think.
@VernNotice For me, it's the following:

1) He Got Game
2) Love &amp; Basketball
3) Hoop Dreams

Space Jam gets an honorable mention.
Lunch with kathryn_ryan. #bbq @ Social BBQ 
Big thanks to @godfree, @playit, @gamertagradio &amp; the folks at @ProFlowers on the hookup for the $50 gift card!
@godfree @ProFlowers @gamertagradio @playit Oh, you better believe I do!
My new life goal is to be this good at ping-pong.


@MaddenBible #BootyHadMeLike 
Happy birthday, @JosiahRenaudin!
Dwight Howard's post game is looking worse than usual tonight. Too much muscle &amp; no touch around the bucket.
@Chupacaubrey Whoa, that's huge! Congrats, Aubrey!
@mroahrig @Skiffington_ 

*explosion*

*Max crashes through window*

"I slept in the same bed as this guy!"
@Skiffington_ @mroahrig Skipping out on E3 this year due to the wedding in September. If my YT channel blows up, I may go in the future!
@mroahrig @Skiffington_ I hope to see all of you guys in person at some point. Fettuccine Alfredo is on me!
@Skiffington_ Haha, thanks man. Really happy with how it's progressed these past few months. Aiming for 20k subs by the year's end!
@Skiffington_ It feels like yesterday that you only had baby teeth.... 
@Skiffington_ No problem. Saw it sitting in my inbox when I wrote one for an old coworker. Proud of what you've accomplished, Dillon!
@ovfd55 Yeah, it's pretty apparent now.
100% chance that the @EAMaddenNFL cover athlete for Madden 16 is Odell Beckham. They've set him up for success.
Congrats to @godfree on getting inducted into the podcasting Hall of Fame! 
Just got back from seeing Avengers w/ @bshifflett22. Shoutout to the girl that cried during a certain scene.
@aaronwatermelon Absolutely an overhyped match. The marketing machine ran wild with this one.
But the majority of you bought into an overhyped match and now you're salty about "wasting" $100 dollars. #DoYourResearch
Neither fighter is a knockout artist. Why are you complaining? If you knew anything about either fighter, you'd have known to expect it.
Lots of people complaining about the fight last night. Mayweather is a defensive fighter. All of his fights have this strategy.
@StoneMountain64 
@DreSmithJr LOL. It's frustrating the media didn't make bigger noise out of what he did leading up to Giannis' shove. Would have helped.
@DreSmithJr They didn't suspend him? Wow.
@hernleyt Well, there goes Alex Carter!
@hernleyt We can definitely use more CB help. Was hoping we'd trade up earlier to get Eric Rowe, because we need help at S too.
@hernleyt Wanted Byron Jones in the 1st, but still happy with Dupree. CB in the 2nd round seems legit, so cautiously optimistic! You?
@MattRKyler Cowboys seem like a good fit for him. Should get the help he needs off the field &amp; some single coverage on the field.
Whoever gets Tevin Coleman tonight is lucky. Productive kid who will definitely put up big numbers w/ enough carries.
Dallas got Randy Gregory? Damn.
Said it last night &amp; while it didn't happen at pick 33... it's still a scary combo. 
@SheaSerrano Let's set it up.
@ReesorBoy The next big step is to go in-between my legs. LOTS of work to do before that comes though.
@DreSmithJr Under Stern, I'd agree. We'll see what Adam Silver does here. He suspended Olynyk, so I'll be watching this one too.
@bpmarkowitz Always reminded me of a used car salesman/crime lord.
@DreSmithJr He HAS to be suspended at least a game for his stuff against Milwaukee. Unreal if he doesn't get at least a game.
Further proof that Michael Dunleavy Jr. really doesn't GAF. 
Mike Dunleavy Jr. is quietly one of the dirtiest players in the league. 100% chance he does this against the Cavs.


@stephensonmc 100%
Hadn't tried dunking in awhile, but managed to land a windmill off a bounce alley-oop last night. Getting closer to where I want it.
@LonoSG @deaconblade @vicious696 I mean, everyone thought Alex Smith was a bust. Figured it out &amp; he turned around his career.
@LonoSG @deaconblade @vicious696 Easy to call now. I'd rather not call anyone a "bust" until they've spent 4-5 years in the league.
@deaconblade @vicious696 @LonoSG If it's just that w/ maturity issues, then you can compare 90% of QBs. Don't take the easy route! ;)
@vicious696 @deaconblade @LonoSG Jamarcus was a big guy w/ a big arm. Jameis has a big arm, but has one of the quickest minds for a QB.
@vicious696 @deaconblade @LonoSG Agree w/ Parris here. Jamarcus is the racial comparison everyone "thinks" is right, but Big Ben is perfect.
Lots of intriguing selections for the 2nd night of the NFL draft. DGB, Landon Collins, Funchess, Abdullah, Gregory, Ekpre-Olomu &amp; more.
Man punches bear in face. Recounts story while holding.... a chihuahua. 


If the Titans draft Dorial Green-Beckham at 33 tomorrow, @EAMaddenNFL is going to be insane.
Philip Rivers is expecting his EIGHTH kid?! 
Best part about the start of the NFL season? Opening week has Bucs vs Titans. Winston vs Mariota.
Andrew Luck is throwing for 5,000 yards next year. So many weapons.
Can't wait to see Shaq Thompson play in the NFL. Versatile player, and he does just about everything well on both sides.
Excited to have Bud Dupree in the black &amp; gold. Now we need to address S &amp; CB! 
Has anyone checked on Chip Kelly? 
My pipe dream for the draft was for Trae Waynes to fall to #22 to Pittsburgh. 
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Hopefully you guys trade for Tebow....
Hard not to root for Todd Gurley, especially after seeing him choke up after talking about what he's been through.
@vicious696 No cable, watching through my XBO on Sling.
@sdrotar @Jstein2469 Valid points. At least he'll have good weather? ha
The most important discussion for the #NFLDraft: Can Chris Berman retire already?
Todd Gurley to St. Louis is going to be a nasty move long-term. Having him on turf 8 games a year is exciting.
@Jstein2469 Have to think Gurley. Seems too early for a QB (for what's left).
@ScottOGallagher Schefter is hinting you guys are picking an interesting player. Can't wait.
@ScottOGallagher Pretty surprised you didn't, honestly. I feel like they'll move back. Someone has to want to jump here.
@ScottOGallagher Fully expecting your Rams to be a bit active here for a trade.
I have a new favorite meme. 
:/ ....... 
@YTCreators Working towards 10k subscribers! A little less than 2800 to go. 
@sledgehammer70 Lots of talent this year for us to draft. I'm just hoping the Steelers grab a DB at #22!
Mike Tyson kills it w/ an incredible quote: "Greatness is not guarding yourself from the people, greatness is being accepted by the people."
@IIJERiiCHOII Not sure if you're aware, but GTA Online has cars now.
@EASPORTS_AJ Are you upset because they don't make those in a smedium?
@shinobi602 Jumped back in recently too. Still fun to play periodically. Doubt I ever get into it hardcore again though.
The past 3 minutes of the #HOUvsDAL game has been some of the UGLIEST basketball I've ever seen. Turnovers, missed shots, bad defense...
@JosiahRenaudin Look who made the NBA Y2K article: 
@godfree @vicious696 
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Definitely possible. If nothing else, it seems like we may see features around WR/DB interaction now.
@BenKuchera Both my fiancee &amp; I have FitBits, and we love them.
But what gets people tuned in, commenting &amp; watching content? The negative. Just be careful of what you consume. #ImDone
The media isn't helping with the image either. Plenty of images on SM circulating of all races cleaning up, peacefully protesting, etc
@The_Youth_Move Which we both know is a substitute for another word being used in a not so public setting.
When injustice happens for so long, people eventually snap. If you're mad at the people rioting, focus on what lead to this outcome instead.
I just wish people would realize that #FreddieGray is just the latest individual to die at the hands of the Baltimore police.
I'm seeing lots of "choice" words being used towards the people rioting in Baltimore, which is sad.
The situation in Baltimore is a stark reminder of why I don't comment on current events on Facebook.
@Kathryn_Ryan Meet me outside.
One of the few bright spots in the midst of the #BaltimoreRiots right now. 
In a heated debate w/ @Kathryn_Ryan about moonwalking. Challenged her to moonwalk in the street, but she's not about that life.
@DaveOshry @RiseoftheTriad BUT HOW MANY BEATS PER MINUTE?!
Just watched a lady serve it right off the back of @Kathryn_Ryan's head in volleyball. 
@Donski3 This goes perfect with your Adidas cologne tweet.
@DeejayKnight @vicious696 If he added deadlifts to his stream, would you watch?
@DeejayKnight Glad to hear it. I try to pop in &amp; lurk, but I'll say hey in chat every so often!
@DeejayKnight Keep it up man. You're out there killing it!
@DarrenFeeney @Sir_Android @BenWigdahl @iliv3forthis @CMUchips Maybe @rytherb can DD? Wait, can Ryan (no glasses) drive yet?
The Jon Jones situation sounds bad. Allegedly ran a red light, hit person (possibly pregnant), found cocaine &amp; ran from the scene.
@VernNotice Hope he's alright man.
Cancel the Cavs/Celtics game tonight. Cleveland has won. 
@Shady00018 If you need any additional voiceovers for your videos, let me know. Would love to work with you!
Last bit of my rant: I wouldn't recommend purchasing flowers through @ftdflowers after working with their customer service.
I've made my last purchase through @ftdflowers. Flowers looked rough, missing a rose &amp; the "best" they can do is 5% off a future order.
@TheRealBIGDOOKY For me, I'm happy with the look. I'd rather they go this Joker route than try to emulate Ledger's incredible performance.
@aaronwatermelon Let miserable people complain &amp; live miserable lives.
That's incredible. Wow. 
@majornelson The Aston Martin V12 Zagato is my dream car. Beautiful &amp; it's in FH2! #FreeCodeFriday


@GoldGloveTV #InB4TwoHourTwerkSession
@godfree @vicious696 "My name is Parris, and I can now deadlift over 4,000 Ouyas at a time!"
@vicious696 I'm not harassing you. All I asked for was some deadlifting tips, BUT YOU WON'T HELP ME OUT!!1!1!!
Steph Curry is unreal. How was that not a foul though?!
Harrison Barnes from that UNC school of flopping.....
People on Facebook really are crazy (and don't use punctuation). #kyliejennerchallenge 
@moss2chappy If you're either in VA let me know! Or if we're ever at the Orlando studio together, haha.
Took me until age 26 to learn to control my athleticism. Finally able to get to the bucket whenever I want &amp; make the smart pass when needed
Playing basketball again feels really good. Way stronger from hitting weights, jumper is really consistent, &amp; my defense hasn't been better.
@QJBeat Happy birthday man!
@Kathryn_Ryan 
Here's your first look at @EASPORTSGOLF's gameplay: 
@VR_Crucial No worries man.
@VR_Crucial 2K16 is now confirmed to be Curry/Harden/Durant (see previous tweet). Live is probably LBJ, Anthony Davis, or John Wall.
@VR_Crucial That's likely why they're moving to the 3-star cover. Makes an easy transition.
@VR_Crucial Yeah, forgot about LBJ on 2K14. I still think it was a contractual agreement that stood (Durant was paid for Elite 11 cover).
@VR_Crucial Not sure if there's an exclusivity deal or not. I just imagine that his price is SKY high.
@VR_Crucial Kevin Durant was on NBA 2K15, not LeBron James (he's yet to be the cover athlete of a game).
@KlayRule WTT kind of solidified my feelings on him. Everything just feels "forced" &amp; not really as "natural" as other artists.
@CoreySA Oh, good call. May see them stay w/ an Adidas athlete because of that practice facility thing they added though.
@JosiahRenaudin You know, they added the Adidas practice facility. Wouldn't be surprised to see them stay w/ an Adidas athlete. Good point.
@CoreySA Haha, I knew you'd respond! I just can't think of a single Jay-Z track that was "great" (in my mind) or that I miss hearing.
Have to imagine that @EASPORTSNBA makes a run for LeBron James as their cover athlete this year.
Man, @NBA2K just locked up 3 of the 4 most marketable players for the NBA 2K16 cover. 
@KlayRule Gave it another listen, but still doesn't do anything for me. Guess I just don't really feel Jay-Z's stuff.
@KlayRule Out of curiosity, which one? I'm struggling to think of a Jay-Z track or verse that I really like.
Does anyone ever crave Jay-Z tracks? Because I can't think of a single Jay-Z track that I'd ever crave or that I miss hearing. #HesNotGood
@TyHeisman23 Haven't created too many offensive lineman since there hasn't been a huge demand for them yet. I'll keep him in mind though!
@TyHeisman23 Feel free to suggest some other players though. Trying to get to as many as I can for you guys!
@TyHeisman23 Thanks for the suggestion, Ty! He's looking to be a late rounder at the moment &amp; not really any requests for him. Sorry!
@DMZilla Yeah, it looks incredible even from an off-screen shot. I'll search our iMac for it though. Thanks!
@DMZilla Wow, your background is incredible. Mind sharing where you found it?
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Doubt he falls that far. Feels like he'll be gone in the 1st round. Way too good of a talent to not take a gamble on him.
@YTCreators Video games (sports &amp; shooters)
OKC really just fired Scott Brooks? Unreal man, unreal.
@GoldGloveTV Happy birthday man! Can't wait to see what you do over the next year!
@Sir_Android @TheRealBIGDOOKY @iliv3forthis @BlondeNerd Thank you!
Crazy. Just crossed 7,000 YouTube subscribers on my @GoodGameBro channel! 
Kind of made me realize that I've neglected saying "hey" to strangers the past few years. Small deed, but I feel like he did me the favor.
He kept thanking me during the convo, and mentioned how people in that area just don't really stop to talk to strangers anymore.
Everyone stared as it flew by, but I ran about 30 feet to chase it down before it blew into traffic. Guy said thanks &amp; we chatted for awhile
On my walk to work this morning in DC, a city worker's hat blew off &amp; flew by myself and roughly 5-6 other people.
@KyleWebber44 I hope they can keep him &amp; Gasol there. Enjoy the toughness that team plays with each night.
Mike Conley was about a foot away from fully cooking Damian Lillard.
If Mike Conley played in a larger market, he'd be a household name.
@vicious696 That's sick! I've told you before, but your journey has been a huge inspiration for me. Thanks for helping me turn it around!
@FreeTheGainz About four months for me to see physical improvements &amp; notice large jumps in strength.
Go to the gym &amp; push yourself, people. You'll be happy with the results.
Being able to bench my bodyweight will never not feel strange. Jumping as high as I did at 18, which feels great.
Being skinny my entire life, it feels weird to be in great shape now. For the first time in my life, I don't feel "out of place" at the gym.
@joe_lucas11 I can't wait to beat people in Madden 16 with Tebow.
ESPN the next 48 hours:

- Tebow
- LeBron
- Tebow
- LeBron
- Terrible jokes
Tim Tebow to Philly? Let the anthem come back out!


@DMZilla If you get a chance to visit Sedona, it's definitely worth the trip.
@TaikeinCooper No excuses come September 5th.
@hanyan21 Plenty of people in a rush to get married, but not enough committed to finding the right one &amp; staying together.
@TaikeinCooper Bring your sneakers. Playing the morning of the wedding. I need some easy buckets.
@hanyan21 Try watching someone get engaged after you &amp; get married before you.
@TaikeinCooper Just don't let them see your jumpshot...
Saturday morning basketball with coworkers &amp; friends might be my favorite weekend thing. Starting to get some good runs in!
@bpmarkowitz See you out there after a bit!
@ScottOGallagher Good point. I'm excited to see Parsons go against HOU too. If Howard plays well (unlikely), it'll be a great series.
@ScottOGallagher Agree on just about all of those, but not sure on the HOU/DAL series yet. I think the Bucks could push CHI to 6 games too.
I can not WAIT for the @NBA playoffs to start today. Lots of great match-ups in both conferences.
@iliv3forthis "I got this."
@D_Hiatus I'm hoping they can regain what they had earlier in the year!
@D_Hiatus Donnie, you can't be drinking and tweeting......
@CMUchips @czach1r When you finally propose, I'll do a Darth Vader voice for free.
@christms_ 
@RatedSGames Agreed. Was really difficult to get that data before, but now it's incredibly useful to analyze &amp; tailor content.
@NewYorkRic "Yo, the dog pooped on the carpet."

"We don't have a dog....."

"I mean...."
Realtor e-mails to show your place. You put your dog in the cage, lock it &amp; go to work. Realtor shows place, lets dog out, dog poops.
@VernNotice Did you accidentally change the properties of a layer to mask by accident?
@Malik4Play As long as they're not "pay-to-win" I'm okay with them.
@MaddenBible Was on it a lot yesterday (left home at 90%) &amp; it was at 30% at midnight last night. Charges really fast too.
@MaddenBible Long time HTC user &amp; I switched to the Galaxy S6. Fast, lots of cool features &amp; I'm really happy with the purchase.
@RealBenGilbert Their Twitter account (standard &amp; support) only seems to respond if you praise them, not if you have an issue/complaint.
@RealBenGilbert Meaning, quality severely dips at the start of a new show or new hour (ie: ESPN) and then slowly returns to normal.
@RealBenGilbert Yup, that's the process I use. Also, whenever it hits a new hour or a new show starts, the quality goes bad to normal.
@RealBenGilbert Almost always requires me to close it &amp; then re-open it.
@RealBenGilbert Seeing hitches from time to time, pausing, app crashes a few times each day.
I have a new favorite Price is Right contest.


@aaron_shifflett I don't challenge mole people to competitions involving strength anymore. #MoleStrength
@cccgolfer08 @Kathryn_Ryan Glad to hear it! Can't wait to get out there.
@cccgolfer08 @Kathryn_Ryan Looked at a few, but ultimately chose Excellence Punta Cana. Where'd you guys stay?
Booked the honeymoon travel for @Kathryn_Ryan &amp; I tonight. Can't wait to be in Punta Cana in September! 
No. Just....... no. 
@TheAlfredoPlays Nice! On a similar journey. Started at 162, currently at 182. Aiming for 190 by my wedding in September!
Slowly, but surely, making improvements in the gym. Was able to rep 190 lbs on bench press at the end of my workout. #progress
He's only 20.......


Was driving back home &amp; passed a few kids playing outside. A small girl yelled, "EVERYONE HERE IS A THOTTTTTTT!" #OurFuture
@czach1r At four episodes, I've opened the trapdoor &amp; jumped in. Beyond impressed.
Four episodes in &amp; @Daredevil on #Netflix is incredible. Wow.
@Coulthart Thank you!
@Nick_Mudry Thanks, Nick! Things going well with Harmonix?
@Nick_Mudry Same company, but moving from Site Search Manager to Web Strategy Manager. Better fit for my skills, so I'm excited.
@UniqueMazique Thanks man!
@cccgolfer08 Thanks!
Rollercoaster of emotions to go from laid off to essentially promoted, but just excited about my new role &amp; responsibilities.
Been a crazy month. Laid off w/ a transition plan from work, but officially accepted an offer today to move into a higher role.
@RLebron12 Cool, it's yours. Send a DM to the @GoodGameBro account &amp; I'll give you the code.
Anyone looking for a @MLBTheShow @SkinIt code? Not planning to use mine so I'd rather give it away!
@GrubbWVU That's still the greatest thing we've ever done.
Despite my YouTube channel only being 6.5k subscribers, having viewers say I'm their "favorite YouTuber" is so sick. Keeps me grinding.
@GoldGloveTV Can't tell if it's more of a general "sub" to YouTube or to individual content creators. Regardless, it's exciting news.
@DMZilla @ashtonisVULCAN Whoa. Early congrats!
@Bertholomey Thanks!
Man, @lootcrate does some incredibly creative (and smart) things in regards to YouTubers &amp; streamers. I'm impressed.
@deaconblade Glad to hear it. Mine should be arriving on release day (Friday). Excited to finally upgrade!
@deaconblade Whoa, you already have the S6? I'm over here being a peasant waiting until Friday's release date, haha.
@jenkins32 I have an extra Duke hoodie if you're cold......
Seeing Grayson Allen step up tonight was huge. Looking forward to seeing him &amp; Luke Kennard in the backcourt next season.
Duke wins! 
#lemonbooty
TYUS JONES!!!! WE OUTCHEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Nice try, Frank Kaminsky.... 
Hey @Kathryn_Ryan, if Duke wins this game because of Tyus Jones... our first boy will be named Tyus. #TheGAWD
#TYUSJONESTHEGAWD
Grayson Allen... #TheGAWD
Tyus Jones... #TheGAWD
@ScottOGallagher Post-moves improved over the year, but needs more variety. LOTS of upside for him though w/ ball control, passing &amp; defense
@ScottOGallagher Absolutely. Karl Towns Jr. looks to definitely be going #1 now.
Tyus Jones &amp; Justise Winslow keeping Duke in the game right now. Okafor just hasn't shown up.
@bshifflett22 Blue Jays.....? Is that a lacrosse team?
The way the @RedSox are playing today has me reaaaally excited for this season. Special squad.
@MaddenBible Try out Heist &amp; Blood Money. Here's a tutorial I put together on improving you KD/playing better: 
Best part about having Easter dinner at your place? Keeping all of the food.
@Kathryn_Ryan That might be the worst photo of the two of us I've ever seen.....
@TBSDman Every top program wants him. It'll be interesting to see where he lands, or if he plays professional ball overseas for a year.
@DatGuyLirik Would love to see two-step authentication added.
If you don't think Sam @dekker wanted this win tonight, check out his Twitter banner. He never forgot the feeling. 
@bpmarkowitz Would have definitely been impressed if they pulled it off.
That being said, can't WAIT to watch Duke play for the title on Monday.
Huge congrats to Wisconsin. Nothing to be ashamed of for the UK kids. Incredible season, but offensive inefficiencies hurt down the stretch.
Difference for Kentucky this year was that the Harrison twins were awful down the stretch. 5-6 shots missed the rim in final 4 minutes.
Calipari won't feel as bad about this loss when he signs Thon Maker to Kentucky in a few days.


Hell of a game, but it's been ruined in the last 4 minutes with horrible calls. Winner will be questioned non-stop.
I don't think that was a foul on Lyles, but that's definitely the refs using it as a "makeup" call for his neck chop earlier.
Sam Dekker! #TheGAWD
It's been a really long time since a Kentucky shot actually hit the rim....
Kentucky sure is getting some crazy calls right now.
Got into the Rainbow 6 Siege PC Alpha. Can't wait to start streaming it on April 7th!
The #BeyondScaredStraight vines are some of the greatest things we've ever been given.


This will never not be funny to me.


@TooMuchHamza My views represent people named Hamza.
@Donski3 "My views are representative of Tootsie Roll lovers."
People realize that having that in your bio hasn't helped anyone before right? Say or do something dumb, and it's not bailing you out.
One of my favorite things on Twitter is seeing someone with a statement about how their views don't represent their site/employer/etc
@JosiahRenaudin B/c someone told them they should care &amp; they listened. (Like they do w/ all Nintendo products) #shotsfired
@KlayRule Not shocked that you quoted me incorrectly in a tweet. :)
@KlayRule Thought I said that it'd be going against what he said, not that he "wouldn't" leave.
@DeejayKnight Is that you in the bottom left of the LootCrate ad? Can't tell. 
@DaveOshry "Soon."
@czach1r If you win, I'm going to need you to speak your acceptance speech as if you're Ja Rule.
@UniqueMazique D'Angelo ruined it.
@KlayRule Blueberry pomegranate if possible.
@KlayRule Make sure to pick up a few extra Gatorade drinks on your way, k?
@vicious696 @godfree Amiibos serve as much purpose as the Ouya. #Facts
@Dwayne236 @godfree I just don't know what point they serve. Haven't looked into them since they don't interest me though.
Anyone interested in hooping Saturday mornings in Harrisonburg? Putting together a list of interested people.
Amiibos are the gaming industry's version of Beanie Babies. I honestly don't get it.
@bpmarkowitz Exactly. Couldn't put it any better.
@bpmarkowitz 3 years of Varsity basketball with him pushed me more mentally &amp; ultimately kept me out of making some horrible decisions.
@bpmarkowitz Absolutely. Had him in 8th grade for Algebra I &amp; I've never been pushed more in the classroom than with him.
"And if life is short then we'll be the shorts of the Fab Five." - Wale 
@MillenniumOS My RTTS player is a SS, and I had a sick back-handed glove flip to turn a double play recently.  Yelled after seeing it.
Jon Calipari is always recruiting. If you're a parent who has a kid with huge basketball talent, you have to want him as the coach.
@czach1r "Monica killed her."
Can't stop laughing.


Hearing that my high school coach (and the reason why) was let go blows my mind. Small rant can be found here: 
@I_Unforgettable Is he gone from Luray High? Or just coaching? Regardless, it's insane.
@I_Unforgettable Unfuckingreal. Any idea why they fired him?
@I_Unforgettable They fired Sanders?!?!?
@I_Unforgettable What happened?
@GoldGloveTV Congrats bbgurl. Just picked up a shirt. Couldn't be happier for you! 
@VernNotice Yup, Road to the Show. No cutscenes, but you travel from AA to the MLB. Here's my series using it: 
Man, @sagesteele is a cold-blooded assassin. 
I generally think April Fools is a dumb holiday, but @YouTube has an "Auto-Darude" button that plays Sandstorm. Genius.
#RIPChrisPaul 
If I ever have a kid that loves basketball, we'll watch highlights of the @spurs. Unreal ball movement &amp; selflessness on the court.
@Sir_Android Always a great feeling.
Creating videos that hit 1,000 views blows my mind. I can't imagine how crazy it feels to have 10k-20k+ like some of the bigger YouTubers.
@MillenniumOS Nice squad! Managed to snipe a 95 OVR Yogi Berra off the marketplace for 650 stubs earlier. Worth taking a look!
@MillenniumOS Hitting Sony up for a refund as we speak.
@MillenniumOS How many complaints will there be about McCutchen still having his dreads on the loading screen? lol
@MaddenBible Nice! I'll have a ton of MLB 15 content on my YouTube channel tomorrow morning for the game. 
@LD2K That's great news. Hopefully it helps the league turn more of a profit to continue to improve.
@MarcRader68 No doubt. So many tense moments &amp; great surprises. Really happy with how it panned out.
@Bgamer90 Feed was great for me tonight. Small quality issue when show first started, but was fixed within 30 seconds or so.
@Brett6547 If you have an Xbox One, do the free trial on the dashboard &amp; see how you like it.
@Brett6547 We cut the cord a few years ago, but for $20 a month, I'm fairly happy (sports/AMC/TNT/HGTV mostly).
Shoutout to @Sling for fixing their connectivity problems. Pretty sure I'll continue as a subscriber now.
The last scene of #TheWalkingDead legit had me like..... 
Best episode of #TheWalkingDead they've ever done. Holy. Shit. 
...................... #TheWalkingDead
@GrubbWVU Glad they saved him for the finale. Absolutely one of my favorite characters.
That's an incredible opening. #TheWalkingDead
Blows my mind that just a few years ago @Clayster was winning local tournaments I ran. Now? Best player in the world. Congrats man!
Couldn't be happier for @Clayster. Finally got the World Championship. Congrats man!
@DMZilla Rooting for @DenialEsports here. @Clayster used to play (and win) in COD tournaments I held at a store I managed. Incredible player
@Clayster Keep killing it man. Pulling for you guys today!
@Kathryn_Ryan Chinese food.
Nothing wakes you up quicker than your dog throwing up on your bed. At least it was on @Kathryn_Ryan's side though...
The only bad thing about March Madness? No Stuart Scott.
@KlayRule I'm not saying Texas isn't the "better" job, I'm just saying he's been open about why he wants to stay at VCU for his career.
@KlayRule He's been pretty open about why he wants to stay at VCU. Would be really surprised if he ended up leaving.
@MrComeBack_AcB Picked them in an upset for my 2nd bracket. Fingers crossed they pull it off!
Trevor Lacey came to play for NC State, but they need more than him contributing to pull out this win.
6,000 YouTube subscribers. Appreciate all the support! 
Happy birthday to the worst Rock Band keytar player of all-time, @Donski3!
@godfree Absolutely!
@godfree Taking this year off with the wedding in September. May do PAX East next year instead though!
@godfree It's the only thing that actually works on the Ouya.
If you ever needed proof that Iggy Azalea is trash....

@owengood My uncle works for the IRS and that's not what he told me. You don't even have a withholding HALF as good as IRS 2K5......
@owengood I hate that you bought the exclusive license. Learn how to file you POS..............
@nickchester The only review that can solve your dilemma: 
@JakeBaldino Yup. Creator Studio isn't loading for me currently. Was working about 20-25 ago.
The only video game review that will ever matter.


@QJBeat Congrats on 400k man. I still believe that you'll hit 500k before the year ends!
@TheCraigEvans Oh yeah. Loved the one we had in our mall.
@Clayster Good luck man. Bring the title back to VA!
I can't breathe. RT @mikecheck06: I. AM. CRYING. 
The UNC/Wisconsin matchup is one of the better ones of the Sweet 16. Should go down to the wire.
I haven't watched much of Sam Dekker this year, but I like his game. Even teased a Shamgod on that last play!
@bshifflett22 I'd absolutely be one of them.
If the @CW_Arrow kills off who they teased this week.......... 
@MrComeBack_AcB Haha, I picked Notre Dame in my bracket. Hoping they can pull it out!
@MrComeBack_AcB Who do you have winning?
@GoldGloveTV I'd wear it.
I'm only 25 subscribers away from 6,000 on the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel! Have you subscribed yet? 
@Nick_Mudry Thanks &amp; congrats to you on the internship!
My student loans are officially paid off! 
@GoldGloveTV :/
@shinobi602 Congrats! Now you can finally put him in an N7 suit!
Happy to see that @idriselba is receiving major role after major role now. Crazy schedule for him over the next few years.
@TwitchSupport Gave you guys the information from my account (WhoIsDo), and now I'm being told it doesn't match. C'mon guys....
@IIJERiiCHOII Have you tried using a program like Handbrake to fix the corrupted file? Had it work a few times for me on corrupted videos.
So, I guess I can talk about this now. We're launching a @rosettastone app on @Xbox! 
@TwitchSupport Are the password reset e-mails working? I've tried yesterday &amp; today with no e-mail being sent to two different accounts.
*radio plays DMX's 'How's It Going Down'*

@Kathryn_Ryan: Is that a new DMX song?
Me: .......
@Kathryn_Ryan: He's still alive, right?
@BenWigdahl You're crazy. To get that many high-profile players to buy-in to his system, reduce their minutes &amp; share the rock is incredible
I really can't understand how Calipari goes 36-0 and doesn't win the Coach of the Year award.
@vicious696 That's what I'm hoping. No spotter, so I'm just working my way up to it to the point where I'm repping it.
Not saying 200 lbs is a lot, but for someone with crazy long arms.. benching is a real struggle. Repping 185 that much at the end was great.
A big fitness goal for 2015 has been to bench 200 lbs. Repped 185 lbs 6 times tonight for a personal best. Have a feeling I can get 200 now.
@Jstein2469 Everyone knows that Matador2K5 had the best halftime show though....
@Jstein2469 And those cloth physics?!? Unreal.
@Jstein2469 I'm boycotting Madden until your graphics &amp; animations are that beautiful/fluid.
10/10 Game of the Year


@GreatWallofChin @IRGRL Glad that the season finale is 90 minutes. Lots to wrap-up &amp; address.
#ShitJustGotReal #TheWalkingDead
@Bgamer90 @Jstein2469 If that's the case, they'll get my money. Just not a fan of paying for something until it works at an acceptable level
@Bgamer90 @Jstein2469 Just do a quick search for Sling &amp; see all the users experiencing issues. Glad it's working for you though!
@Jstein2469 That being said, I'm willing to give @Sling money.. but not until they get these issues sorted out.
@Jstein2469 We cut the cord w/ Hulu &amp; Netflix, and then I stream sports &amp; major TV that I want to watch through Russian sites, lol.
@Jstein2469 When it works, it's great. But the hiccups/stops are incredibly frustrating.
@Jstein2469 Frequently stops/buffers, even though my connection is constant &amp; hasn't dipped. Happened on ESPN/AMC/etc at various times.
I really wanted to give @Sling my money, but it's just crazy unreliable...
@JosiahRenaudin Mostly trolling. Just hearing about long load times, insanely difficult, etc. Not my type of game, but hopefully it's good.
@JosiahRenaudin Might want to put your mattress outside of that window.
The Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation trailer features the Fugees? Sold.


@Esko I think that's the comedian that looks eerily close to him.
@godfree @vicious696 The trilogy is coming exclusively to the @playouya though.
@vicious696 Surprised that it isn't the first 3 + Ascension, honestly.
@vicious696 My assumption is they'll improve textures &amp; use it as a "bridge" until they drop the next GOW title.
@vicious696 Yeah, not sure how I feel. Never finished that game, but feels like remastered versions are Sony's only thing atm...
Well, looks like God of War III Remastered is hitting Playstation 4 this year.
@joe_lucas11 No chest bump?
@JakeBaldino Congrats, Jake!
Can't imagine coaching your kid &amp; watching him hit the biggest shot of his career. Fell out of his chair, too.


RJ Hunter is unreal. Shoutout to #TeamLightSkin

The state of Iowa is dead to me now.
@bshifflett22 You don't know the pain..... 
The @htc M9 drops in the US on April 10th. Was hoping for an earlier date, but I'll just struggle w/ my current phone until then.
190 subscribers away from 6,000 on @YouTube. Crazy.
@StoneMountain64 #RiotShield
@D_Hiatus Had to clean up my followers a bit to get more positivity going awhile back. Worked miracles for discussions!
@D_Hiatus Conversing with the wrong people, apparently.
It's because of people like him that really help me understand that anything I'm going through really doesn't mean shit.
As if the cancer wasn't bad enough, this kid lost his mother &amp; his brother to cancer over the past few years. Life just isn't fair man.
When I started creating websites, I met a guy starting his own who helped me out a LOT. Just learned he now has cancer for the 5th time.
@godfree Having a lot of fun with it. Haven't finished the campaign yet, but it's better than what BF3 &amp; BF4 offered. Multiplayer is great.
@trixie360 Just now seeing this, and I look forward to reading how  you crushed cancer!
My @Battlefield Hardline giveaway has less than 5 hours left. Get your entries in NOW! 
@owengood Regardless, I agree - it'd be terrible for all that scanning work to go to waste.
@owengood True, but I have to imagine that Augusta's group couldn't have been too "excited" about that being in the game.
@owengood When they showed a battleship crashing into the course, I fully expected Augusta to be gone from the game.
@Donski3 "Boxes" &amp; "Hamburger"
@MUTGuru Hope to hear that they're bringing you back sooner rather than later!
John Oliver kills it again with his examination of the NCAA &amp; March Madness: 
Kendrick Lamar featuring George Clinton on the opening track of his album is perfect.
@JosiahRenaudin Thanks, Jo!
I'm giving away a copy of @Battlefield Hardline. You have one day left to enter! 
@christms_ My exact reaction. So pissed.
#EverybodyHatesChris #TheWalkingDead
@sledgehammer70 Congrats!
@joe_lucas11 Oh, haha. Thought you meant one for Luray High for some reason.
@joe_lucas11 Which tournament &amp; where?
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Considering the mediocrity you guys went through for awhile, it's good to see new (young) pieces come in.
Kenny Stills to Miami? The Dolphins are loading up. That's going to be a crazy division.
"That Power" as the ending track to Camp by @donaldglover will always be perfect.


@TheRealBIGDOOKY If that happens, it'll be scary. Their fanbase will only grow &amp; more players will want to play there at that point.
Nick Fairley to St. Louis makes that team really scary. Their defense was already intimidating, but their front line is huge now.
@cccgolfer08 Go with the console that:

1) Has a lot of your friends
2) Comfortable controller
3) Attractive exclusives or features
@bpmarkowitz Are the top three buttons on your shirt undone? If so, yes.
@nickchester @grrlaction 
@Esko Definitely. Colts are intriguing, but they've added some old age there. Interested to see what they do in the draft.
@Jstein2469 Apparently rumors are swirling that Tampa Bay is "aggressively" pursuing a trade w/ the Vikings for Peterson.
Adrian Peterson to Tampa Bay? Man, they're loading up down in Florida.
@DeShayYRIT Since I doubt you're drafting someone in the 1st, Tevin Coleman would be a solid 2nd or 3rd rounder. Can't block though.
@SimFBallCritic Watched the whole thing &amp; couldn't stop laughing.
@SimFBallCritic Hard to believe that Richmond, of all places in Virginia, has the KKK represented that strong.
I'm thankful every day that I'm mixed. Can't imagine growing up in a world where I'd have views that idiotic. #LT
Don Lemon interviewing a KKK member 2 hours away from me. So much going on here. 
@shinobi602 Had the same issue on Madden 15 &amp; a few other games. Really weird.
@StoneMountain64 Loading mine up now. Hit me up if you want to play!
@hanyan21 Hopefully you guys have great neighbors. We feel pretty fortunate to live in a quiet neighborhood!
The Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack is incredible. Wish it was on Xbox One though.


@Jstein2469 I'm down. Servers have been a bit iffy right now, but we can try to get @Kevin26385 to join
@LLSMUVG Definitely a legit rumor. Apparently they're just entertaining talks &amp; seeing what his value is currently.
@JosiahRenaudin Seeing it all over Twitter. Seems like speculation, but apparently the Saints are looking to rebuild after Graham trade.
Now there's talk about Drew Brees being traded? Possibly even to Buffalo. Crazy.
@RiverdaleUmp They have no assets to trade &amp; acquire him now though.
If Kaepernick gets traded, Twitter might explode.
@AiiRxJONES The city of Philadelphia can't catch a break lol.
Eagles traded Nick Foles for Sam Bradford? Here's a live look at Chip Kelly making that move: 
Yo, Chip Kelly really is drunk.
LMAORT @AdamSchefter: Rams close to trading QB Sam Bradford to Philadelphia for Nick Foles and draft-pick compensation, per sources.
Marriage cancelled RT @Kathryn_Ryan: @WhoIsDo I love Matty B! 
I'm never playing against the Seahawks again in @EAMaddenNFL. Wilson + Beast Mode + Graham + Legion of Boom.....
Jimmy Graham to Seattle? 
@bpmarkowitz Probably good that I didn't see this yesterday when I was throwing up.
I don't wanna live in this world anymore, man.


@bomani_jones Did you see what they found the OU frat mom doing on Vine? Unreal. 
@deaconblade Appreciate it. Hoping that it's just a 24-hour bug that passes.
@mroahrig What filter would you like? Sepia would be nice, but may not fully show you the color. Your call.
Haven't vomited for a few hours, but still feeling rough. Hopefully this sickness passes soon.
@vicious696 @godfree Thanks guys
@bpmarkowitz Would make sense, because it came out of nowhere.
Vomited a ton this morning, so I'm pretty sure I have food poisoning.
@Jstein2469 OH. The "Wolves Not Far" thing.
@Jstein2469 Hm, not ringing a bell. Any hints?
Also, that "W" they saw on a zombie early in the episode.. I feel like that's actually an "M" for "Morgan". #TheWalkingDead
Every single time there's a "peaceful" episode of #TheWalkingDead, the next episode is usually crazy. Looking forward to next week.
Rick: "So, you want this pipe or nah?" #TheWalkingDead
Carol DGAF about giving a kid nightmares every night. #TheWalkingDead
It's possible that the @NBA MVP could be wearing Under Armour shoes. Never thought I'd see that happen... #StephCurry
The #UNCvsDUKE game isn't technically over yet &amp; UNC fans are already on my timeline like.... 
I think Joel Embiid might do well next year. Just a hunch.


@Da_Czar They embraced the strategy the Bulls used against LeBron in the playoffs. Feels like they showed their hand early though...
Not spoiling anything here, but the ending of #HouseofCards Season 3 essentially was what I was expecting. A bit disappointed.
Current view. #snowday #winterstormthor @ Harrisonburg, Virginia 
@godfree @vicious696 I think we've found the "killer app" for the Ouya.
@godfree @vicious696 When is your game dropping, Danny? 
@ReesorBoy My jazz-hands are better than ever now.
@vicious696 I'm still waiting for the "Parris Deadlift Simulator" to hit the Ouya. Heard it's arriving in the Spring.
@Jstein2469 It's an okay device. We put that in the living room. Works fairly well for Hulu/Netflix.
Being in the gym consistently the past few months has been incredible. Lifting weights &amp; doing things I've never been able to do before.
#DontTradeRussellWestbrook


@Jstein2469 That being said, we got rid of cable 2-3 years ago and just use our XBO &amp; Roku.
@Jstein2469 Tempted to try it, but I believe it can only be used on one device at a time. That was a dealbreaker for us.
New Avengers trailer.


@I_Unforgettable Nice purchase though. I'm sure she'll like them.
@I_Unforgettable I'm not sure if I'll ever go away from Flyknit now. I have 2 pair of Lunar Flyknits, and they're incredible.
@I_Unforgettable Flyknit or regular? Contemplating grabbing a pair for Spring / Summer.
@I_Unforgettable What'd you pick up?
@Jstein2469 Some might say that my GIF game is 99......
Kanye's 'All Day' is on @Spotify? 
@DMZilla "Soon."
@aaronwatermelon @JakeBaldino That's what we do in America.
@christms_ Not as good as Twix?
Just voted for my friends over at @gamertagradio in the gaming section for the @podcastawards. Show your support too! 
@LD2K Whoa. Glad to hear you'll be alright, Chris!
@Aiervon Well aware, but looks/sounds like McCoy doesn't fit what Kelly wants at RB (which is kind of odd, honestly).
@Aiervon Eh, tough to say. Kiko had 150+ tackles as a rookie, and McCoy came good yards but barely any TDs. Interesting trade, for sure.
Oh, now Drew Rosenhaus is saying McCoy WASN'T traded for Kiko? Things are about to get interesting....
I was up until 1:30 AM last night editing videos for YouTube. Received this comment today that validated that effort. 
The Buffalo Bills have officially eliminated the QB position this year after trading for LeSean McCoy. Rex Ryan won't pass at all.
@vicious696 Which do you love more: Jameis or Ouya?
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Happy birthday man! Anyone get you a LeBron jersey? 
Happy birthday to @Just_Tank! #hesnotmuchofabowlerthough
@MissCarrieDale We're all Petey Pablo.
The @BleacherReport Xbox One app is incredible. A breath of fresh air from the TMZ-esque content that ESPN delivers.
@CMUchips Results: 1

"Yes."
@DMZilla Already brainstorming on some cool things to do with it. Looking forward to its release!
@TannerVaughn I dedicate that song to you.
I mean, if I was in elementary school and had a deep voice, that's one thing. But as a grown man, why do people feel the need to comment?
At 26, I have no idea how to respond to people who comment on my voice being deep. Do I say thanks? Laugh? Such an awkward comment.
While everyone is focused on llamas &amp; what color a dress is/isn't, I'm focused on what really matters... 
@JosiahRenaudin @Skiffington_ It was so young..... 
@Skiffington_ Not sure I can fix this.. 
@Skiffington_ What part cracked? Mine has the flex-bracket on top of the ear piece. Only thing holding it together on that side is a wire.
My work headset (@turtlebeach XP Seven) cracked today when I took it off. You were so young.... #RIP
@Battlefield I expect to see llamas as Hotwire DLC.
@DMZilla Here's the calendar portion that Asana offers, btw: 
@DMZilla Trello is definitely good too. I've had Asana for a long time, so I've just stuck with it out of familiarity. Both are great tools.
@DMZilla I used Asana when running sites, and I use it at work too. Great collaboration tool w/ calendar integration.
@joe_lucas11 "Oh, you mean that guy that owned part of Vitamin Water?"
Man, when Kanye's new album drops..... 
I have a feeling this is the next big indie game people will be talking about soon.


@TEEJSTER77 #TEEJED
@wepeeler Wouldn't be surprised if they revealed it at E3. I believe EA said they'll alternate UFC &amp; Fight Night, but could be wrong.
The basketball gods keep taking Derrick Rose away, but they let Raymond Felton continue to play. Life isn't fair. 
@wepeeler Very true. I wish more athletes had proper instruction on technique when they lift as teenagers. Lots of structural damage there.
@wepeeler No joke. I wonder if the athletic moves players make now contribute to more knee injuries.
@wepeeler Can't imagine how frustrating it has to be for him. How many times can he build himself back up physically AND emotionally?
Derrick Rose has a tear in his meniscus?! Man, the universe just won't let him be great...
@JLaudy 
@CMUchips Nice block by Ben Wallace
@CMUchips Must be a statistical error.
@godfree @ladyluck34 If you say #Ouya three times in a row, a wild @vicious696 emerges.

@_saucymilf Ha, didn't even think of that.
My only guess for what this group will be is a religious cult. No idea though. #TheWalkingDead
@Jstein2469 Yeah, don't spoil it for me, but I fully expect this to turn bad. Has that "too good to be true" feel to it.
100% chance they'll regret this decision. #TheWalkingDead
@GoldGloveTV I'll race you to 1 million subs...

@VernNotice If you need the worst CS:GO player of all-time, hit me up.
Adding a new track to my gym playlist that'll likely be on repeat.


@DaveOshry Everyone knows you're going to JNCO jeans.
@stephensonmc Agreed. Brings me back to my L4D days of feeling rewarded for playing as a team.
@MaddenBible Could definitely see that. They had a survey awhile back regarding music, but they've already held a few "concerts" so far.
@MaddenBible Going with Twitchcon (or something of that sort).
@vicious696 "But what about my triceps?"
@MaddenBible Galaxy 6 &amp; HTC M9 both being announced in March. Leaning towards the M9, but anxious to see the Galaxy 6 too.
@vicious696 I mean.... are you surprised that he's doing something outlandish for views?
Having bi-weekly calls with @YTCreators is really helpful. Lots of constructive feedback to help me grow my channel.
@sledgehammer70 It'd be tough to pick three better studios, honestly. Excited for the future of all three!
@mattbertz Hoping that he mentors some of those guys, particularly Bennett.
"He's averaging how many points?"

"He had a highlight dunk?"

"You know what to do." 
@loudmouthjulia That being said, still quite a lot for fan-funding. Hoping they continue to kill it through Patreon, ads, sponsors, etc.
@loudmouthjulia Considering the high cost of living in SF &amp; paying for their own healthcare, not as much as you might think.
OKC traded Jackson, who was leaving anyways, for a big w/ potential, a solid backup PG &amp; 2 deadly shooters. I'm okay with this.
@ScottOGallagher I think this is my favorite NBA trade deadline ever. Wow.
All of the @NBA trades make me just want to run home &amp; fire up @NBA2K. Whoa.
It feels like the NBA is literally having a fantasy draft. I LOVE THIS.
@BroccoBeef Absolutely. Really happy OKC landed him.
@BroccoBeef Kanter is likely a better move long-term. Lopez is great, but injury concerns probably scared off OKC.
This is by far the CRAZIEST @NBA trade deadline I can remember in a long time. Wow.
I love OKC getting Kanter, just hope he accepts his role there. Singler will help our outside shooting, but I'll miss Reggie. :/

Please tell me the Thunder got Greg Monroe in return for Reggie Jackson. PLEASE.
The #UNCvsDUKE game was incredible. Noticing lots of something on my timeline though..... 
@joe_lucas11 If UNC gets more consistent shooting (especially from outside), they'll be dangerous in the tournament.
@joe_lucas11 But they can rebound. Had no idea they controlled the glass like that.
HUGE win for Duke tonight. Down a lot late, but Tyus Jones came through in the clutch. Incredible.
Talked trash about Matt Jones, and then he comes up with a clutch rebound. #UNCvsDuke
Matt Jones just isn't ready to play consistently yet. So many mental errors tonight.
This #UNCvsDuke game has been one of my favorites in awhile.
Duke's biggest problems tonight have been trying to run the offense through an injured Okafor &amp; UNC dominating the boards.
No idea how that's goaltending by Winslow. Incredible block.

@owengood "Virginia Tech, where NIT appearances happen!"
@owengood I wonder what NIT appearances &amp; victories do for universities?
@LD2K Seeing LAL mentioned, but doubt it happens. Would likely push the LAL away from securing their draft pick &amp; giving it back to PHX.
@I_Unforgettable You're going to Punta Cana? That's what we're looking at for our honeymoon. Let me know how you like it!
@owengood I wonder what the fallout is for national titles in major sports? Feels like 10 years might be the sweet spot for relevancy.
@owengood But yeah, I agree people like a winner. I just wish they'd admit that instead of arguing that's not why they like UNC (or a team)
@owengood It'd be impossible to get this, but I wish I could measure the impact Jordan's attendance (and NBA play) had on UNC recruiting.
@owengood For the out-of-state fans (especially big cities), it just feels like the "Yankees" effect to me.
@owengood Good point. Should have segmented it into non alumni and non-NC state residents.
How many UNC BB fans (non-alumni) would root for them if Jordan never went there? How many root for their FB team? 
@BlondeNerd Zelda sucks &amp; is overrated. Tomorrow I'll ask you for a favor though, k?

@mroahrig @JosiahRenaudin Couldn't pass on that joke. Honestly though, I'm intrigued by the game. Anxious to read reviews.

3-Point Contest? Steph Curry
Dunk Contest? Zach Lavine

#TeamLightskin
The craziest thing about Zach Lavine is that these weren't even his best dunks.


#ZachLavineDaGAWD
Why is Reggie Miller a commentator in the dunk contest? Hell, why is he a commentator at all?
Guesses for Lavine's next dunk:

- Free-throw windmill
- Under the legs/butt
- 360 windmill w/ elbow in rim
To everyone asking if Lavine has any dunks left, you obviously haven't followed him. Still has a few incredible dunks in his repertoire.
@MuslimGoku Which is sad. Incredible dunker.
@Da_Czar #ZachLavine4Heisman
Zach Lavine jumps just like James White &amp; Rodney Carney, but he has more game. Can't wait to watch this kid develop.
#TeamLightskin


@CoreySA LOL, I can't even be mad at that burn.
Calling it now, Lavine is going to do the under the legs/butt dunk in the next round. Watch.
For his next dunk, Zach Lavine will jump over the backboard.
When Zach Lavine dunks, I just forget how to speak. Jesus.

@JosiahRenaudin Oh shit.
@JosiahRenaudin GIVE ME PROOF
@shinobi602 If they're launching in 2016, I'd lean towards no. A 2015 release date would likely mean yes.
@Skittlesdfw Nice! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. Picking up my copy after work today.
@BlondeNerd Agreed. My prediction is that they talk about DOOM 4, TESO expansion, Dishonored 2 &amp; Fallout 4. I'd be more than happy with that
Geometry Wars 3 is on sale for $10 on Xbox One. Do yourself a favor &amp; snag that.
New Kendrick Lamar?! New Kendrick Lamar!


@MonotoneTyrone Appreciate it! Just let me know.
@MonotoneTyrone Up for doing some work for the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel? Could definitely use a new banner! 
Looking for an @EvolveGame code? @PhillyD is giving a few out today! 
Lighting at the office drives my eyes nuts. I have a pair of @GUNNAROptiks at home, but thinking of snagging a 2nd pair for work.
@Kathryn_Ryan We forgot to turn the heat back on. Toby is dead. #RIP
@shinobi602 "Hey babe, I found this interactive movie for us on the 20th. You'll really like it!" #shewontbelieveit
@Wario64 That cameo was perfect.
The cameo at the end of 'Better Call Saul' made watching the episode worth it.
@bshifflett22 Good point. A bit scared they'll get close to pushing the envelope &amp; then cop out with something easier.
@seeson Wow, really tempted to pull the trigger.
Man, 'American Crime' looks really good. Anyone else catch that trailer?
@OfficialCici_xo Yup, familiar with it. Still a small shovel though. :)
Smallest shovel of all-time. #TheWalkingDead
There's not a problem in the world that can't be solved with a Cheesy Gordita Crunch from @tacobell.
@KlayRule No tOSU fans allowed. Sorry.
Had the chance to sample the food we'll likely be using for our wedding today. #SoGood 
@sledgehammer70 Make sure to grab the Red Velvet Oreos!
Looks like the Xbox One will finally be receiving a screenshot feature in the March update.
Heard a Twitch streamer mention they had roughly 8900 subscribers. If they hover around that number all year, it's over $250k. Whoa.
When the NFL Draft arrives, watch out for @B_BENNETT03. Former Oregon QB who transferred, and has a lot of potential. Likely late pick.
@ShayPomeroy Used Apple Maps in FL on a trip with my fiancee. Plugged in "Olive Garden" but we ended up at a cemetery. #RIP
@KlayRule Hope you're doing well though man. I miss our NCAA Football battles!
@KlayRule #whowhatwherewhenwhy #idontlikecriersredcries
@catherinetcai Absolutely. Tons of ideas spinning in my head already. Thanks for sharing that!
@catherinetcai Wow. Can't wait to see developers start incorporating that into mobile design.
So, hey, let's be better about telling people how much they mean to us or just check on them &amp; say hey. #FFT
With so many people passing away recently, I've started to notice how many people regret not telling loved ones how much they meant to them.
@UniqueMazique Good luck man. I gave up on Yao due to some of the limitations I was facing in his creation.
Man, @DarkestDungeon is so damn good. Glad I picked it up on Steam.
Thad Young hit Hassan Whiteside with an old-school DDT tonight. 
@bomani_jones I can't wait to see someone cape-up to defend this image &amp; the "Patriot Way" 
@Sarabia__ That's what I'm leaning towards. Hoping they launch on March 1st like speculated.
@JBHuskers @MattRKyler Only concern is that I'd be using older technology with newer stuff on the horizon (ie: M9).
@TooMuchHamza Not on Verizon, and the Nexus 6 hasn't hit Verizon yet either.
@TehEmoPenguin M9 *seems* to be the perfect phone for me. My current phone is having lots of issues, but may hold out for March for the M9.
Phone contract is officially up today. Any Android phone suggestions on Verizon? Thinking Galaxy S5 or waiting for HTC Hima (M9).
@Scomo843 Had no desire to watch it until I saw that trailer. I'm sold on at least giving it a chance now.
Count me in for @Marvel's Daredevil series on @netflix. Wow.


@ScottOGallagher Michael Jackson. Didn't even have to think about that one.
5,000 subscribers in 22 months. Can't wait to see where the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel goes next! 
@Kevin26385 @AiiRxJONES Ask Kev about our last game of Madden...... #nomercy #BeastModeCheese
Official: Harper Lee's sequel to "To Kill a Mockinbird" will be called "Mockingbird on Fleek"
@ImCAntonio You could have taken 30 seconds to do a quick Google search. Instead, you'd rather make a joke for a quick RT or favorite.
@ImCAntonio Ryan Shazier has alopecia, an auto-immune issue that causes hair loss. Might want to check before you do that, you know.
@TheClapperton Glad to hear you'll be back man!
@ronyatco Big fan of Spotify though. Use it every day at work &amp; I've discovered a lot of new artists with it.
@ronyatco In Canada, perhaps?
Top tracks for each year you were in school. Go swim in nostalgia. 
Sony Online Entertainment, who makes H1Z1, was just purchased. Being rebranded "Daybreak" &amp; will do "multi-platform" titles now. Wow.
Excited to drop a few exclusive Battlefield Hardline videos in the morning too. Be on the lookout for those!
This should be the week that the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel should hit 5k subscribers. Been putting in tons of late night work!
Patriots player just threw a punch. Let's see what happens.....
Somewhere in Wisconsin, Mike McCarthy is saying, "That was the right call, Pete." #GiveMarshawnTheBall
Should have run it in with Lynch. #SB49
We owe that catch to #KatyPerryTheGAWD.
@owengood That's just NC State Russell Wilson making the ball work for his team.
THAT WAS A CATCH?!?! #SB49
@CoreySA I'm not really one to throw shade on someone for their religious beliefs.
If Russell Wilson leads a game winning drive here, you can book him as the @EAMaddenNFL cover athlete.
#KatyPerryTheGAWD
You're out of your damn mind if you don't think this was one of the most entertaining halftime shows at a Super Bowl. #SB49
Miss Elliott is alive?! #SB49
@wepeeler So good!
But I'd be lying if I said Katy Perry wasn't absolutely killing it out there.
This Katy Perry halftime show at #SB49 is going to spawn so many damn GIFs &amp; memes. I can't wait.

as your wom…
Someone is going to make Katy Perry's "roar" into an incredible inappropriate GIF in 30 minutes. #SB49
Marshawn Lynch scored that touchdown, looked at the ref &amp; said, "I'm just here so I don't get fined." #SB49
Percy Harvin would have dropped that pass. #SB49
-guys peyton's not in the super bowl we need some new ideas
+um how about dead kids
-you did it ag…
That's just Tom Brady looking like Tom Brady. Throws like that will make 2005 his last Super Bowl.
@ClintOldenburg "The computer won't stop hitting me with nano blitzes!"
#RIP RT @igetbandztho: Damn...<FLUSHED FACE> the NFL been around longer than our government. We've had 48 Super Bowls &amp; only 44 presidents.

Watch live here - [
In DC tonight for the @WashWizards game with @kathryn_ryan. 
Apparently @TayZonday tried to stream on @Twitch &amp; ran into some *small* audio issues. 
@godfree @stephensonmc Don't listen to Danny. He's used to playing easy games on the Ouya with @vicious696.....
@stephensonmc Seems like you'll get the most out of it if you have friends to play co-op with, from what I've seen.
@stephensonmc Best suggestion I can give is to watch a Twitch stream on it. Likely going to pick it up once I have time to play.
@GoldGloveTV Couldn't breathe at this part: 
I really want Damian Lillard to average 50PPG the rest of the year. Unbelievable that he was left off of the All-Star team.
@JosiahRenaudin Agreed. Feels like it's gone the old Kotaku route of culture/random things.
Was out of town early this week so I forgot about @DyingLightGame launching. Caught a stream last night &amp; it looks pretty fun.
@BenKuchera Responded by telling the reporter to come ask him in the inner-city about his charity if he actually cares.
@BenKuchera Did you see his press conference? Incredible line when a reporter asked about his inner-city charity.
@Lunchbox700 That's still a bit higher than me, honestly. Not even sure if I care enough to watch it (even streaming).
@StevenCampos2 I don't really know boxing PPV numbers that well, so I won't comment other than saying people are getting fooled lol.
@StevenCampos2 3 million people buying it? or 3 million in revenue?
@CRBUKE Definitely have to agree. Both fighting towards the twilight of their career to stay relevant in a dying sport.
Floyd Mayweather Jr. is 37. Manny Pacquiao is 36. People are actually excited for this fight.

This is how far boxing has fallen.
Conan + Gronk + Marshawn = Hilarious.


@JosiahRenaudin I vote that we now call them #Peoles 
@JosiahRenaudin How about the people that post individual lifts/exercises to show you how to do it? Kills me every time.
@JosiahRenaudin Exactly. I see so many people in the gym every week with their cellphone showing their "progress" off.
@JosiahRenaudin Same goes for people talking about macros.
Made eye contact after he did it, and he just smiled and said, "I've never seen snow where I'm from."

Its the little things, man.
Shuttle driver that took me to my car stopped the bus and walked outside with a piece of paper. Why? Because he wanted to scoop up snow.
Thought United lost my luggage, but someone pulled my bag off of the other side and didn't put it back on the conveyer belt. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Heading home. #sunrise #SFO @ San Francisco International Airport (SFO) 
@christms_ Just finished season one a few days ago. #RIP
Didn't realize until the Fantastic Four trailer that Michael B. Jordan was 'Wallace' in The Wire. 


@MillenniumOS @ClintOldenburg Maybe it's mental, but I use it when I pass. Likely just mental, but "feels" like I have better precision.
@jenkins32 They did, lol.
@leftosa BRB, flooding your timeline with a summary of each page.
Decided against buying wireless on my flight in favor of reading. Smart decision. <OK HAND SIGN>
@BenKuchera Our neighborhood (VA) has every room wired with ethernet access. It's really nice!
@bshifflett22 Ah, forgot all about that show. Good call!
Flight out to the west coast tomorrow. Need movie/book recommendations. Any suggestions?
@SimFBallCritic @CoreySA Seen a few episodes here &amp; there, but never sat down to watch it in its entirety.
@CoreySA Nope :/. On the final episode of season one now. I'm hooked.
@JLaudy Some tears don't go into asphalt. They go into the field. 
@JLaudy I'll make you absorb these tears!
Episode 10 of the 1st season of The Wire has me over here like..... 
@aaronwatermelon That's an incredible burden on a child. Not many can live up to that........... pedigree. 
I'll never understand why someone would name their kid Jasper.
@VernNotice Don't ask Josh Smith for one.
@ScottOGallagher Have to imagine that Kobe's last season is next year. Expecting a media circus similar to Jeter's last run.
@ScottOGallagher Would make the most sense, honestly. Let him recover, save the 1st-round pick, and try to put together a better team.
@ScottOGallagher Is it confirmed that he's out for the season? Or just speculation?
@ImCAntonio Accidental click, lol.
Not even Kobe Bryant can escape father time. 
I love these &amp; I lost it at 1:54. 


@aubradley84 Madden 2002 had an expansion draft, so I'm hoping that's what you're checking out. #pipedream
@tryFindingQuiet It would have been more entertaining, at least!
@MaddenBible Bumblebee. #RIP
Thanks to the transformer that just blew up outside of our building, I can now eat my oatmeal instead of work.
OKC played an abysmal first half with Serg/KD/Waiters taking horrible shots. Glad they picked it up in the 2nd half &amp; won in OT tonight!
#RIPGortat 
I may have my new motivation track.


@GoldGloveTV Gears of War montage at 1 million subs or I'm unsubscribing.
@MattRKyler Lots of cool small things in the press conference. Hands-on impressions will go live today/tomorrow to hear more.
I'm not sure I've ever said this before about Windows, but I can't wait for Windows 10.
Cross platform (PC &amp; Xbox One) gaming confirmed thanks to Windows 10 on certain games. Great news, @XboxP3!
@Andrew_Reiner It's the sequel to Her.
Microsoft is showing some pretty crazy virtual reality teases here. Interested to see where the Windows 10 event goes now.
@OujaStrike @ForumDestiny Yup! You can join it here: 
Nick Marshall is moving from QB to CB for the NFL Draft. .... Has that ever happened before?
@RealBenGilbert Game won't come until 2016, so it'd be nice to see a re-release announced around PAX or at the event tomorrow.
@Scomo843 You'll likely enjoy it. Season one is pretty good, but season 2 was really impressive. A few corny things, but solid.
@EvolveTom That looks insane. Ouch.
@bomani_jones @BerryTramel The "from the streets of LA" thing bothered me. Seems he's taking Westbrook's dislike for him &amp; trying to magnify
@wepeeler MP4. Any gameplay is 1080p/60 FPS
Couldn't be happier for Russell Wilson. Any athlete knows what it's like to have a terrible game &amp; then turn it around. Incredible. #GBvsSEA
"I'll see you in the Super Bowl." - Russell Wilson #GBvsSEA 
@ImCAntonio It's about how you finish, not how you start. #lessonlearned
@ImCAntonio Wait, you were talking negatively about Wilson the entire game LOL.
Where's all the shade you trolls were throwing at Russell Wilson earlier? #GBvsSEA 
Dear Russell Wilson, I have some advice for you in OT: don't pull a Hasselbeck. #GBvsSEA 


Fans of both the Packers &amp; Seahawks are doing rituals in their homes to try &amp; win this game. 
Aaron Rodgers has ice in his veins. Orchestrating an incredible drive right now. #GBvsSEA
@Kathryn_Ryan All the time. Come upstairs &amp; I'll say it to your face. 
YO, LMAO. If that happened in @EAMaddenNFL, I'm quitting &amp; selling my Xbox One. #GBvsSEA
There's a LOT of time on the clock though. Seattle better hope their defense can hold up. #GBvsSEA
Yo, Marshawn Lynch really is the GOAT. Sign that man to a lifetime contract. #GBvsSEA
Seattle has to be careful not to score too quick here. Need perfect clock management. #GBvsSEA
Also, please let this game end on another #FailMary. Please. #GBvsSEA
I HOPE Wilson drives down the field &amp; wins the game here so I can individually call out every fake Seahawks fan that gave up. #GBvsSEA
If this were @EAMaddenNFL, I'm calling 'Quick Slants' &amp; getting the TD. #GBvsSEA
@ScottOGallagher Exactly. #NotRealFans
Not sure why people, especially fans of a team, openly give up with 5+ minutes left in a game. Not a TD by Lynch, but they have a chance.
@RosieEhlers Taylor Swift?
@AminESPN How much of an impact do you think his brother's death has had on these concerns?
@DeShayYRIT Yeah, I believe he died back in October due to a car crash.
@DeShayYRIT Wonder how much of that weight came after his brother died though.
Always funny to find a video, post it, and then watch numerous outlets grab it with no shoutout for being the one to discover it.
@BenWigdahl "Also known as Ben Dover Farm." 
@BenWigdahl LOL. We pass it on the way to Richmond. No idea what's actually there.
@BenWigdahl .... I think we both know who is more important here...
@BenWigdahl Home to Justin Verlander.
@PappyShannon Fiancée brought some home &amp; we made a pizza on it. Incredible.
Downloading @H1Z1game. Should be able to play in the next 20-25 minutes. Anxious to play!
@bshifflett22 Have to wonder if Urban knows something we don't. Whole situation just seems strange, or maybe he's concerned about durability
Have to wonder how JT Barrett feels right now. Already used his redshirt, and Jones is coming back after winning the title.
@ImCAntonio I don't think you're understanding the point I'm trying to make. I'll just leave it be at this point.
@stephensonmc @sergiodaprokkz @vicious696 LBJ probably told him to have this conference! #shotsfired
@ImCAntonio Easier to say than do with national media attention/tweets. Again, this is more about Urban recruiting than Cardale.
@stephensonmc @sergiodaprokkz @vicious696 Can't be, because I picked tOSU to win. I love Urban. Brought 2 titles to UF. Best coach/recruiter
@ImCAntonio Your issue is with the media more than it's with Cardale.
@vicious696 @sergiodaprokkz Enjoy the circus that your QB situation becomes next year. Miller is likely out, but Barrett vs Jones?
@ImCAntonio Again, no other player was in the national spotlight for their unique situation on that roster.
@ImCAntonio Mentioned it in my tweet, but that conference was more about Urban Meyer recruiting than it was Cardale's future.
@sergiodaprokkz No need for a press conference to announce you're staying. Can quickly turn a "humble" scenario into a nightmare player.
@ImCAntonio Plenty of those starters weren't receiving national attention for their talents either.
The Cardale Jones press conference was more about Urban Meyer showcasing that OSU is where recruits want to be than Jones deciding to stay.
@ImCAntonio You're conveniently not mentioning the fact that he one a national title.
@dbowen52 Interested to see what happens. 22 year old sophomore with 3 years of experience, but someone will take him in the 2nd.
@WesPhillips Ah, nice. Haven't started reading the book yet, but hoping to do so shortly. Heard great things though.
@WesPhillips Whoa, had no idea the cast was that huge. Any sign of a trailer?
@ZAN_4PM @Sgibs7 Same as most, prep school, I believe.
@dbowen52 Let's not forget his infamous quote about going to school for football, not classes.
@dbowen52 I can see it both ways. Declaring this year has lower expectations, puts him in 2-3rd (likely at best), and he gets money.
@thatzacdavis Technically a Sophomore.
@Sgibs7 That's what his tweet seems to be implying. He's 22, but a bit skeptical he's "ready" to make the leap.
@thatzacdavis He's 22. Did a year or so at a prep school after high school.
If his tweet is anything to go off of, it looks like Cardale Jones may be going to the NFL. We'll find out at 3PM EST.
@GoldGloveTV Looking forward to the stream. Likely going to grab it when I'm home later tonight!
Hard to believe the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel is less than 200 subscribers away from 5,000 in less than 2 years!


@Steve_OS That Total Gym though.....
@kapreudhomme Can't really discuss it since I'm under NDA, but when I can, it'll be in the forum I linked!
@kapreudhomme Definitely. Well hopefully you join the forum &amp; you'll get lucky with a member hooking you up! 
@kapreudhomme Definitely. I was fortunate to get into the first alpha, so hoping for news on a new one soon!
@kapreudhomme Thanks for the follow, Kenny! We'd love for you to join our #Fortnite forum &amp; discuss the game! 
@RiverdaleUmp Definitely worth the watch. Great cast &amp; great stories.
@ImCAntonio Not on Netflix, and pretty sure it wasn't on Hulu Plus either.
The Wire is on Amazon Prime? Time for me to start from the beginning &amp; actually finish it.
Spent the night away from coding  websites, writing articles, and editing videos to hang out with friends &amp; watch football. #gooddecision
@sledgehammer70 Looks incredible. Thanks for sharing!
@sledgehammer70 That looks incredible. Any interior shots out yet?
I'd pay good money to watch Damian Lillard play. Quickly becoming one of my favorite players.


May end up watching the third season of House of Cards in one sitting.


RIP. #INDvsDEN
Sometimes your fiancee sends you to the grocery store &amp; you use the list from 2 weeks ago. #boughteverything

@EASPORTS_AJ I've been looking for an excuse to use it. Thank you.
@EASPORTS_AJ 
Somewhere in Michigan, Calvin Johnson just said, "I know, Dez." #DALvsGB
Hope they don't overturn that catch by Dez Bryant. That's unreal body control. #DALvsGB
This lady is about to drop the hardest album of 2015. 
@GrubbWVU Yeah, been on 30 for about 2 weeks now. Other characters are 27 &amp; 26.
Joe Flacco seems to always get those deep throws to work in his favor. Not this time though.
Tom Brady still puts some of the best touch on a throw in the NFL.
I can't wait to watch Malik Monk play in college in a few years. 
@tryFindingQuiet @NBA2K I had multiple instances tonight of the game being "ready" but we sat there for 10-15 minutes unable to leave/start.
Is it just me or is @NBA2K's Park mode severely broken still? So fun when it works, but getting into matches is unbearable.
@iliv3forthis Yup. Lots of playlists, but my most active is 'Dinosaur Eggs &amp; Oatmeal'
Oddly enough, I credit a lot of my expansion in music to @RockBand. Opened my ears to new artists which pushed me to new genres.
@Just_Tank Fantastic point. The creativity behind music, podcasts &amp; video work (ie: YT) has been exceptional recently.
We're in a period with some exceptionally creative artists. I feel bad for people that only listen to what's on the radio.
@markusfrieske @donaldglover So good. Hadn't actually seen the video yet.
@iGreenTreeFrogg Sounds good. Focusing on leveling up my 3rd character at the moment, but I'll let you know if that changes.
@Aiervon There's a lot of financial talk behind it that'll go over my head, but I think this is a great proposal (at it's core).
Obama proposing 2 years of free community college to Americans is HUGE. Biggest hurdle? Loan companies.


@Steve_OS Everyone knows the Chipotle sauce has a higher spice rating than the Honey BBQ. Anyone who goes w/ Honey BBQ is an idiot.
@Steve_OS Were they Chipotle sauces or Honey BBQ sauces? #itmatters
@Steve_OS Can't believe that EA was bought out by Nintendo though. All EA SPORTS games are exclusive to the Wii U in 2015.
@Steve_OS Series is cancelled. #RIPMadden
@MillenniumOS Wouldn't call MUT a great mode (imo). Great features? Yes. There's a LOT that the mode needs tuned/changed/added.
Steve Ballmer has nothing on the Clippers' mop boy (he was planted though). 
@Esko Yeah, I believe 1-2 franchises did it awhile back. Was absolutely one of my favorite features.
One feature I want in sports games for 2015: Expansion Mode. Let me start up a team/franchise from the ground up.
@sledgehammer70 At least you have the important items out.
@crecenteb Can't get over the fact that they killed @donaldglover in the trailer though, lol. Shows it has (possibly) a dumb trope.
Really liked the trailer for 'The Lazarus Effect' until they killed Donald Glover in the trailer. I mean, seriously?


@LD2K Not usually a fan of Kobe's shoes, but man, that colorway is perfect.
@JakeBaldino I hope it's a snowboarding scene that features a Shaun White cameo.
@Kathryn_Ryan She has to go. No exceptions.
If you're in the mood to remove Facebook friends, I suggest starting with people on this list: 
Really proud of the work @RatedSGames has done since we worked together. Sick @Halo video on @didyouknowgamin.


Would have preferred the @okcthunder received Shumpert in that trade. Tried to get him during the draft, but couldn't make it work.
Maybe @KingJames will head to the @nfl after this Dion Waiters for JR Smith trade.
Trading Dion Waiters for J.R. Smith is like using a time machine to trade for the same player... but just older.
LMAO RT @WojYahooNBA: New York is sending J.R. Smith to Cleveland, league sources tell Yahoo Sports.
Have to imagine that Brendan Haywood is included in the Waiters deal. Expiring contract that'll be valuable for other teams.
@CMUchips LBJ just hasn't ever really seemed comfortable playing with Waiters. Both drive a lot, and Waiters wants more shots.
Dion Waiters finally gets traded. Have to wonder if this works out better for LBJ than it did for MJ when Rip Hamilton was traded.
@notaxation Couldn't be happier for you, @GameOverGreggy &amp; everyone else.
A great @TEDTalks about the science of conversation &amp; how negative tones can lead to conflict: 
@JakeBaldino Audacity
Man, can't believe @StuartScott is gone. Wanted to be a sports anchor for the longest time because of him.
@ScottOGallagher @CoreySA I can't see Jones moving up to HW until much later in his career. Too much success &amp; $$$ to be made in LW now.
@CoreySA @ScottOGallagher Don't forget that UFC 178 was Gus vs Jones, but Gus was injured so they replaced him with Cormier.
I'm still salty over the Steelers losing. I'll just leave you with Suggs farting his own name. 
@CoreySA Definitely agree, just have no idea what Dana would do if Gus didn't pull out the victory.
@CoreySA Should be interesting though. If Gustafsson loses, does Dana go with Johnson/Jones or push Cormier/Jones?
@ebongeka Just anxious to see what happens with Gustaffson now. If he wins, rematch with Jones seems likely.
@ScottOGallagher Agreed. I honestly think his camp was banking on at least one ground round. Didn't get it (obviously) &amp; paid for it.
If Gustafsson beats Johnson on the 24th, then I think we have a good chance of seeing the rematch with Jones. Good momentum post #UFC182
@AdamItkin34 Which is why I said people should want the Gustafsson vs Jones II match ;)
Honestly though, if you're wanting Cormier vs Jones II over Gustafsson vs Jones II... I think you're a little crazy. #UFC182
The best part about sports? You can say whatever you want as long as you back it up. Don't like what your opponent says? Beat them. #UFC182
With Jon Jones beating Cormier tonight, I think it's time to setup Jones vs Gustafsson II. #UFC182
Absolutely had a feeling something like that would happen at the end between Jones vs Cormier. #UFC182 #sneakattack
@GrubbWVU Giving 2 rounds to Cormier feels like a bit of a stretch now. Judges usually side with the champion in "close" rounds.
@MaiaAlexis143 I challenged you though. If you lose, I've flipped the tables. #dontmessup
Four rounds in, Jones &amp; his camp have executed the perfect gameplan. Complete domination in round 4 by Jones. #UFC182
The strategy by Jones is crazy. Goes from Ali "rope-a-dope" to crazy ridiculous takedown attempt out of nowhere.
@MaiaAlexis143 Hurry up &amp; lose to me in Trivia Crack.
Not saying that Daniel Cormier isn't already a star, but he's not the "household name" that Jones has become the past 2 years.
This is the feat that the UFC has needed. Jones NEEDS this fight to cement his legacy &amp; Cormier NEEDS it to catapult him to stardom.
Jones vs Cormier. It's finally here.

Who do you have tonight? #UFC182
Martavis Bryant is such a stud. Having Brown/Bryant/Wheaton in our WR core has been sick all year.
#BasedGod 
Not even exaggerating here: Ryan Lindley might be the worst NFL QB I've seen in a really long time.
@MaiaAlexis143 
@Da_Czar Start a party chat &amp; then make it invite only.
@TyHeisman23 Yup! He should be done in the next week or so.
@AiiRxJONES Happy birthday man! Hopefully you're receiving lots of that #wingcheese
Never thought I'd see Alabama's starting QB be worse than Ohio State's 3rd string QB in my lifetime.
@CMUchips Don't worry, #PBJV will still happen.
If Mariota keeps this up, I think I'm naming my first son Marcus.
Mariota's pass there clenched every butt cheek in the nation.
@TyHeisman23 Thanks for reaching out! I'll add him to the list, but I have quite a few other players ahead of him at the moment.
Personal goal this year: Have the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel hit 20k subscribers. Starting 2015 with 4.6k.


@MR21215 Thanks Marc. You too man.
Looks like my Facebook news feed will continue to deliver in 2015. 
@aaronwatermelon @kanyewest I can not WAIT for the full album to drop. One of the few artists who I'll support by buying the entire album.
A new @kanyewest track is the perfect way to start off 2015. 
@SheaSerrano Sounds like Isiah Thomas when he was coaching.
That kid with the crazy dunk last night? It's Michael Porter Jr., a mixed kid who's a top prospect for 2017. 
@QJBeat 
@Jstein2469 I mean, if you do... we can always rob a few armored trucks again.
@GreatWallofChin Says the man diving after a donut in his avatar!
@Kathryn_Ryan You kept taking these deep, dramatic, ridiculous breaths that would wake me up.
@GreatWallofChin It's also a great week to add donuts to your life.
@MillenniumOS Yeah. It's an item that you can redeem for 10k coins.
@MillenniumOS Looking at the MUT gifts, it looks like today is Frozen Coins &amp; K George Blanda.
@MillenniumOS @CRBUKE I'd only use that card against @Kevin26385 if that's the case.
@MillenniumOS It'll be interesting to see what it is. I really wanted that 99 Bo, but didn't get lucky.
@MillenniumOS Out of position player makes a lot of sense, actually.
@MillenniumOS People seem to think Bo, but I highly doubt it. Going to assume it's a coach or decent player.
@MillenniumOS Feel free to send that Raiders gift to a dear friend named Douglas...............
Antonio Brown is just unreal.
The @NBA2K roster that I'm creating is something special. Can't wait to release it for XB1 &amp; see the reactions for MyLeague/MyGM players.
@czach1r Not disagreeing with you. Shortened the tweet from originally having "Congrats on being" .. they're separate thoughts poorly worded
@czach1r Read the first sentence of my original tweet. Second sentence was merely marveling at his accomplishment.
@czach1r It definitely is. Still doesn't change the fact that he should be MVP with what he's done on both sides of the ball.
If JJ Watt doesn't win MVP, then the voters are crazy. First player in NFL history to have two 20-sack seasons.
And yeah, my league is one of the dumb ones that uses week 17 as part of the championship.
First time ever being in my league's FF championship. Down 30 points, so I need a miracle to actually win. Regardless, $100 to 2nd place.
@ChanceTheGreat Definitely. Has a lot of issues, but that's to be expected with an alpha build.
@CPaladino #TweetsFromtheFuture
@sparchief117 Nice! Looking forward to that.
Finally caved and bought DayZ tonight. Should be interesting!
@israeljcruz This version of Bo expires though, right? Then the "gift" floating around should theoretically give a "real" Bo, right?
@israeljcruz No fumbles yet for me. I'll blame you if he does in my next H2H game though!
@MaddenBible #99AWR
@MaddenBible How long before she has multiple tabs open to find the best blitz out of the 4-3 playbook?
@Da_Czar Definitely do, but I'd like a bit more transparency around them. Am I close? What's needed to earn them? etc
@joe_lucas11 I feel like "Psycho Manly Transexual" is the name of a band that'll start in Page County.
Spent Christmas Eve with @Kathryn_Ryan's family. Her nephews spent an hour educating me on everything they can do in Minecraft. <OK HAND SIGN>
@NewYorkRic #BasedWiyaHanga
@CoreySA After I take up your ancient art of Tai-Bo.
@NewYorkRic Wanted to, but I was afraid he'd end up like Delonte West. That wall knocked his hat (backwards) off though. Laughed pretty hard
Situations like that let me know how far I've come in controlling my anger. Maybe my Canadian genes are finally kicking in at 26.
For once in my life, I wasn't the instigator of the trash talk. Guy swung (&amp; missed) when I walked away &amp; said, "Whatever man."
There are some crazy people in the world. Won a basketball game &amp; had a guy swing on me afterwards. Turned, stepped, &amp; he ran into a wall.
@MaddenBible Sucks that no major phones are launching soon. A good deal may push me one way or the other though.
@MattRKyler I love it, but not seeing any great Android phones launching near February.
@CoreySA The older I get, the more I just want simplicity. Also, battery life on my phones has been a bit frustrating recently.
As someone who has only owned (and loved) Android phones, I'm really tempted to switch to an iPhone on my next upgrade.
Company #holiday party. #lastnight 
The Toronto Raptors removing the purple from their logo/uniform is terrible.

#NeverForget 
Still the greatest song &amp; music video combo of all-time. 


.@Nike consistently tugs at my wallet each time they release a new pair of shoes from Stefan Janoski. 
Just witnessed the most insane, crazy, deadly driving maneuver I've ever seen.

They were going to @BurgerKing.
@ImCAntonio No public announcement by EA, so I honestly don't know. If it is up though, I'm sure they're both negotiating w/ the NFL.
@ImCAntonio They're definitely working on the MLB 2K revival though. Saw a job posting for it last year.
@ImCAntonio If that NFL exclusivity contract ends any time soon, I fully expect 2K to be pushing for a split-contract.
@vicious696 Wrong sport.
@czach1r I can neither confirm nor deny this was the title I was speculating on.
@ImCAntonio Wouldn't be surprised if NFL 2K returned within the next 3-4 years.
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Would love that, but doesn't seem likely. 2K is definitely working on MLB 2K again though. Not sure if this year or next.
Pure speculation, I'm feeling that we'll see a certain sports game have a rebranding next year. New name, new direction,  etc.
If you haven't already, check out Kendrick Lamar's interview on The Colbert Report &amp; his new track: 
@ArcaneNLSC Not really a J Cole fan, so I'm probably not the best person to ask, haha.
That song that Kendrick Lamar premiered last night on The Colbert Report is too good.  <OK HAND SIGN>
@Esko Had mine on! 
@Esko I look forward to tweeting you on February 18th with a trollish GIF.
Hoping Jabari Parker recovers fully &amp; has the NBA career he's destined to have. Special type of talent.
Man, I feel bad for making this tweet about Jabari Parker months ago now. :/ 
@pravisti It's well-deserved! Great product &amp; great people.
@JRobAndSteal Congrats, Jon!
@SurviveThe9to5 100% real, unfortunately.
@Malik4Play Ha, makes sense. I'm on PS4 too (non-Destiny). PSN is the same as Twitter, so feel free to add me.
Three invites left for @inboxbygmail. Who needs one?
@Malik4Play Only playing Destiny on XB1 right now. Assume you're playing on PS4?
@Malik4Play Everything else feels mostly consistent in terms of difficulty on VoG, but that part is incredibly easy. Just feels like filler.
@Malik4Play The one spot that felt extremely off to me was the long hallway that leads to the drop for the wizard/shrieker fight.
@Malik4Play Definitely agree. But ultimately, I think that's how it should be. Crazy sense of accomplishment when you beat it.
@Malik4Play It's not *crazy* if you have a good amount of teamwork. Put together a guide for the raid: 
I recently moved desks. I now share a wall with someone who loves raccoons...? #cubiclelife 
In 2000, I couldn't understand half the words D'Angelo sang. 14 years later, it's the same thing with #BlackMessiah.
The Titans almost pulled the Music City Miracle 2.0. Whoa.
@Ryan_LaFalce Appreciate the support on the videos though. Should have a few more rolling out this week.
@Ryan_LaFalce I haven't uploaded them to any rosters yet, but may do so once I've created a few more. It'd just be XB1 though, if I do.
In just 20 months, the @GoodGameBro YouTube channel has hit 2 million views. Kind of crazy. 
@loudmouthjulia Absolutely. Just DM me your preferred e-mail for the invite.
Looks like I have 5 more @inboxbygmail invites. Who needs one?
@TheRealBIGDOOKY So good. That show has had issues here &amp; there, but I really enjoy it. Can't wait for January 21st now.
The mid-season finale of @CW_Arrow might be the most I've cursed at the ending of a TV show in awhile. Wow, so good.
No. Just no. RT @BestBuy: We have everything you need. Unless you need a payphone. #Serial
@ReesorBoy Seeing now that Shields &amp; the Giants is a big possibility.
@ReesorBoy Yankees have to want Scherzer as their #1. Slightly younger, but a bit better at this stage. Hopefully he goes back to Detroit.
@ReesorBoy My hope is that they go with Shields, and Scherzer goes elsewhere (or to the Sox). Don't want him in the AL East.
@ImCAntonio If you click "Sort By", what options do you have?
The @RedSox just traded Cespedes for Porcello? Feels early, but if Porcello resigns long-term &amp; he's given run-support... I'll like it.
Moved desks today. Neighbors seem nice. Is that a........ raccoon...? 
@mrprice33 Did it hit Xbox One yet?
@ImCAntonio Eh, not really feeling that track either. Just feels forced &amp; "generic" to me (album).
Can't really get into J. Cole. Tried listening to his new album, but just not a fan of his work.
@TyFromPhilly Tweet looks to be removed now. Wasn't confirmed, just someone saying they looked "visibly broken"
Terrible news about @CameronNewton. Possibly has two broken legs. Hope he's alright.
Really excited to be able to select the @Twitch quality when watching streams on my @Xbox. 
@KlayRule Plot twist: I'm really Tim.
@KlayRule Plot twist: I lied.
Since September, I've added 14 lbs from working out 3-4 days a week. Big thanks to @vicious696 for helping me get here!
@vicious696 Not bad for an old man.
If you've seen season 4 of The Walking Dead, you'll enjoy this. 2:50 killed me. 
@askBBT That enrollment &amp; login would have been somewhere between 2002-2004, lol. I called during the weekend &amp; fixed the issue.
The "Rand University" 30 for 30 by @bomani_jones was incredible. Pretty sure that's my favorite one to date.
Human Element looks nothing like what they made it out to be initially. Kind of disappointed. #TheGameAwards
Locked out of my bank account because I can't answer the following question: "Where were you New Years Eve 2000?"

Thanks, @askBBT
@bpmarkowitz Nothing says the internet quite like a katana &amp; a video camera.
On pace to hit 2 MILLION views before the end of the year on the @GoodGameBro channel. Only took 20 months!


@MattRKyler DM the e-mail you want to use it with, and I'll hook you up.
So many friends suffer from #VVS, and it drives me nuts. 
Looks like I have 5 more Google Inbox beta invites. Need one? Let me know!
The @serial podcast is incredible work. The interviews &amp; investigative work really show you how much perspective matters in trial.
@RatedSGames Should just be on the channel page, from what I've read.
@Malik4Play There's a URL at the end of the trailer, shown briefly. The video in my tweet is from that URL. Definitely the Jaffe game.
@Malik4Play Check out my last tweet, Malik.
@kingcaleb4 @Steve_OS @SonySanDiego It's a teaser for @davidscottjaffe's next game. Expect an announcement in the next day or two.
.@SonySanDiego's announcement is from @davidscottjaffe's Bartlet Jones Supernatural Agency studio.


Here's what @SonySanDiego is working on next: 
Looks like @YouTube has enabled "Fan Funding" for partners. That's great news for YT creators!
@EvolveTom Definitely agree. When people see the "value" or a reason to be "hyped" for it, they'll flock &amp; pay attention to it.
@LD2K #OnATuesday
@Esko Each episode is about an hour &amp; a half, but only 3 episodes per season. Definitely worth watching when you can.
@Esko Don't forget Andrew Scott! Did an exceptional job in Sherlock, and anxious to see him as the villain.
2K just announced a new studio in their Novato headquarters named "Hangar 13" that's working on a AAA title. Interesting....
@thekrispythings Thank you!
@thekrispythings Would love one!  Doug(dot)veney(at)gmail(dot)com
@bshifflett22 Well, I have been wearing nothing but jorts lately......
@bshifflett22 The only pair of pants I had were way too tight. Believe me, Dynamic Aviation wasn't ready for all that.
I look forward to seeing JJ Watt break the sack record &amp; receiving TD record in the same season in the future: 
@GoldGloveTV Crazy, didn't even realize it. Just started putting my YT videos in 1080/60. Looking forward to your streams in dat 60fps!
@GoldGloveTV Twitch is supporting 60FPS now? Wow.
@HANDSWARD_EA Better question: why does it even matter what race a character in a movie is?
@AminESPN Crazy how they took a character I didn't care about &amp; created one of the show's most memorable moments.
House of Cards is back on February 27th, 2015. #VacationDay
I'm not a "concert" person, but man.. if you had a Lorde + Kanye or Lorde + @donaldglover collaboration.. I'm in the front row.
@CoreySA Ah, nice. I'll give it a shot this week. Thanks for the reminder!
@CoreySA Haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. Any favorite tracks?
Lorde, Pusha T &amp; Q-Tip collaborated on a track?! Not a bad way to start off Monday. 
WHAT #TheWalkingDead
@christms_ "Shutup." #sogood
@joe_lucas11 I think it's time you tell Deb you need a man-cave, lol.
@joe_lucas11 When you have kids you'll be able to teach them your football knowledge &amp; watch in comfort. Can't watch with my family either.
It's rare that I really listen to someone else's opinion &amp; take it to heart, but man, my grandmother knows how to get through to me.
@mrprice33 Had to Google him (haven't watched USC this year), but man, he KILLED Notre Dame today. Other than UCLA, he's been unreal lately
@mrprice33 Everyone wants to play in Oakland...................................................................................... #ornah
@mrprice33 If Oakland picks before Jacksonville, I feel like he'll go there. Kevin White (WVU) will be high on draft boards too.
@mrprice33 And I'll wear his jersey to work every single day. Unfortunately, I don't see him falling past #10 if he works out well.
RIP to the @JMU staff lady that was just tackled out of bounds.
J.T. Barrett is a monster. Great poise in the pocket for a redshirt Freshman. #OSUvsMICH
@bshifflett22 Trailer does look solid, won't dispute that. I enjoyed the new Star Trek movies, so I'll likely give it a shot.
@mroahrig With that being said, parts of that trailer did interest me. Maybe I won't fall asleep?
With the release of the Force Awakens trailer, I feel like now is a good time to say I fell asleep during the only Star Wars movie I saw.
I'm not sure what's more crazy: people who create Facebook profiles for their animals, or the people who send them friend requests.
Looks like I'm the only one working on this floor today. #BlackFriday @ Rosetta Stone 
@TheClapperton Can't play tonight, but if you're on XB1 &amp; ever want to play, let me know. Gamertag is the same as Twitter!
Man, @Kathryn_Ryan couldn't wait to eat..... #RIPfork 
@CMUchips @KlayRule #TommyPickles
@FortunateDad No problem. You should have an invite soon!
@FortunateDad They actually gave me one additional invite today. What's your e-mail?
Killer Mike's speech about Mike Brown &amp; Ferguson during the Run the Jewels show is worth a listen. 
@Esko Sort of in the same boat. However, didn't feel much "stress" from Pratt in the trailer. Also, kind of felt like a Predator trailer.
@patrickklepek Didn't feel enough "stress" or "panic" in his voice compared to what I was expecting.
Not 100% sold on the direction for Jurassic World, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 
@ReesorBoy The hardest part for me to grasp is people defending there not being an indictment. Let it go to trial to determine the facts.
The prosecuting attorney for Darren Wilson is the PRESIDENT of a company that raised money for him? C'mon man.. 
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope." - MLK Jr. #Ferguson 
@Kreyg Glad to see that you're back to streaming. I try to watch as I work from time to time!
@Skiffington_ @JosiahRenaudin @mroahrig #RIP
@bshifflett22 That offer will stay on the table for a few years, don't worry!
@bshifflett22 We'll give you Nava for Aaron Sanchez..............
@bshifflett22 True, plus, we have Bogaerts at SS now (keep forgetting). Apparently Pablo is near final, so yeah, him at 3rd &amp; Hanley in LF
@godfree @vicious696 @CPaladino True, too high-end for the Wii U. #OuyaIsLoveOuyaIsLife
@vicious696 @CPaladino Pretty sure that's the Wii U, guys.
Having Hanley Ramirez and Pedroia turning double plays in Boston will be sick, but really hoping we get Pablo too.
@Donski3 Oh boy, that's unfortunate. #Photoshop
@Dtownsend23 Glad to hear you're liking it!
For being an early @Xbox One adopter, Microsoft is giving me LIMBO when it releases? Pretty sick.
@Kariizma_x @GoodGameBro @EASPORTS_MUT One-time use code, so be quick!
@JakeBaldino Where? I can't see it?
Yet another sick video by @QJBeat. Love the idea! 
@DMLFury Whoa. Sorry to hear that, Drew!
@MaddenBible DM the e-mail you want to use for the invite, and I'll hook you up!
@sparchief117 It's a new version of Gmail. Condenses things &amp; gives you a new user interface. If you want an invite, DM your email.
Looks like I have 4 more invitations to Google's Inbox beta. Anyone in the need of an invite? I'll pick four who respond at random.
If you're a Game of Thrones fan who hasn't caught up, you may want to watch out for spoilers in @NBA2K. 
@NBA2K @raptors 2000 NBA Dunk contest. There will never be a night as incredible as that one.
"Your password will expire in three days. Please change it today!" 
My hero. RT @cnndaillynews: Boy claims to have super powers after eating 7 year old kid cuisine microwaveable meal 
It's crazy to me that it took a viral joke from @hannibalburess for people to care about Bill Cosby's crazy behavior.
The stuff that Jordan Kilganon does is just unbelievable. 
Watching @Kathryn_Ryan play volleyball in a rec league, and I'm crossing my fingers someone calls her "Kathy"
@ShaunMichael80 @GoodGameBro @EAMaddenNFL We add players that people request to play with, not just eligible draft players.
Impressed with what @netflix continues to do with original programming. I'm in for #MarcoPolo. 
@LLSMUVG Sorry man, had a lot of people wanting the invite so I assumed you didn't want it anymore. I'll let you know if I get more!
@JosiahRenaudin #MikeEvans4Lyfe
Mike Evans was my best fantasy play of the day so far. 32 points in a non-PPR league with 6 minutes remaining!
Todd Gurley tearing his ACL is terrible news. Hope he's able to rehab &amp; get back to where he was before the injury.
That hit on Emmanuel Sanders was pretty scary...
Did JJ Watt just catch an over-the-shoulder fade in the endzone for a touchdown......?
@TooMuchHamza Sent. Delete that tweet, btw. It'll save you from having spam bots blow up your inbox.
@TooMuchHamza Still want that invite? Haven't heard back from the other guy.
Never change, Lance Stephenson.  
@stephensonmc Nice! If you pass Harrisonburg, VA.. let me know. We can grab a bite to eat!
@stephensonmc Sick. Flying down or driving?
@stephensonmc Had no idea that it was in Virginia tomorrow. You going?
@christms_ If I get any more I'll hook you up!
Todd Gurley still has it. I realize they called it back, but couldn't be happier for that kid to be back on the field.
@TooMuchHamza Fifth &amp; final one was requested. Waiting to hear back if he wants it. If not, it's yours.
@WTF_OS Just sent yours out. Heard it can take a few hours or up to a few days. Let me know when you get it!
@KlayRule Sent a few ago. Let me know when you get it!
@Dtownsend23 Invite sent. Could be a few hours or few days, but look out for it!
@LLSMUVG Send me your e-mail &amp; I'll hook you up!
@Dtownsend23 Sure thing. What's your e-mail?
@KlayRule Yup! What's your e-mail?
@EddieHigh Sent. Not sure how long it'll take, but you should hopefully have it soon.
@EddieHigh Best e-mail to send the invite to?
Any followers want an invite to Google Inbox? A few invites left!
@CPaladino @KyleWebber44 @vicious696 Thanks guys. Next goal on bench is 200lb, but plenty of other goals on my other lifts too.
First time in my life that I've ever repped the equivalent of my bodyweight, 175, on bench press. Starting to see significant progress!
@CoreySA It's 2014. Who even checks their voicemail now?
#LifeWithKT 
@MillenniumOS @ZoKnowsGaming People will definitely care. I'd expect that first patch to be available around Xmas for new purchasers.
@MillenniumOS @RockstarGames Not the day one patch, but the 1st patch post-launch of XB1/PS4: 
@JakeBaldino I feel like that's going to be YouTube gold though. Viral video in 3, 2, 1.....
@ladyluck34 Yup. Solid coder, but pretty sure that's fan-made. Companies don't deploy websites from staging to production "early" like that.
Conflicted on whether or not this #HaloWars2 website is legit or not. Coding is extremely well done, but seems "dated" for a teaser.
@I_Unforgettable Crazy server issues. Hopefully they fix them soon.
@GoldGloveTV Bow down to my master Halo 2 skills! #lastplacedontcare #teamspeaktime
Halo: The Master Chief Collection keeps throwing me in random games.
@Ty_Stover Miss the days of NBA Street &amp; NFL Street!
I can't breathe. RT @GUCClSACE: WHO'S RESPONSIBLE 
@MaddenBible @Paakaa10 @Sir_Android I'll likely use Chromecast &amp; stream it to our big screen. Looking forward to finally catching it!
I've been wanting to see "Gravity" for awhile now, but hadn't made an effort. Google just sent me code to snag it for free. #basedGoogle
@vicious696 Hopefully there's a surprise GOW collection next year &amp; a new GOW released on the 10-year anniversary. #pipedream
@swadelandis Is it a soft-open or their full open? I saw that they're planning to open up this week. Regardless, let me know what you think!

@aaronwatermelon Command not recognized. Did you mean "Go to Bing?"
@aaronwatermelon Hi Ethan.
@vicious696 Makes sense. Didn't know he was on his last year. Have a feeling he'll end up on the Jets/Cards as a backup on a cheap deal.
Pretty sure that Sam Bradford is officially out of a job with the way Austin Davis has been playing this year.
@Esko Sick. I'll check it out. Thanks!
@Esko Will that be available via retail? If so, I may have a new purchase coming up.
I think Jerry Jones may want to just pay Dez Bryant at this point...
@Jstein2469 Absolutely. Let's chat over XBL sometime soon!
Time for Interstellar with @Kathryn_Ryan!
@aaronwatermelon @DaveOshry You could get so many 360 no-scopes with those.
@TheeJohnnyB @GearsofWar @Sir_Android @GoldGloveTV @iliv3forthis The amount of people we wrecked on Process (with PDC too) was incredible.
@KlayRule I want to blame auto-correct, but I'm typing on a computer. I must be drunk. :/
@KlayRule Who are you? Didn't you still my torque bow? #whocriesredcries
@Floppy_Ragdoll Whoa. I may have just closed Vegas Pro after seeing that....
8 years ago today @GearsofWar launched. Spent so much time playing multiplayer w/ @Sir_Android @GoldGloveTV @iliv3forthis &amp; @TheeJohnnyB.
Mass Effect fans should be happy today. Expect some news later today.
Man, Gordon Hayward is about to go home &amp; play a LOT of League of Legends.
Gordon Hayward with the buzzer beater!
They gave LeBron THAT FOUL?!?!? That's how you know the refs are out of their minds....
The Jazz are building something special. Gobert, Hayward, Burke, Burks, Booker &amp; quite a few others. They're giving it to the Cavs tonight.

@MillenniumOS We like to call @mrprice33 the #GOAT.
@leftosa No worries, neither am I. I just love a comfortable shoe to play in.
@leftosa Ah, nice. Probably best for indoor playing though from what I've read. Let me know what you think though. Needing a new pair too!
@leftosa What did you pick up?
@BpDzn Looking for someone to design a new header for our YT channel that's sports &amp; shooting (gaming) focused. 
@acarboni Where is the beard?!?
Dressed up as lumberjacks with @Kathryn_Ryan tonight in NoVA. What are you going as for Halloween?
Despite @JLaudy not being in the office, someone is still blaring Rebecca Black's "Friday" ...
"... produced by Amare Stoudemire" may be the most hilarious thing I've seen all night.
I'd like for LeBron to go for 70 tonight. That's not asking for too much, right?
@CPaladino We've known about a bonus wave on a map, but this is a full-blown mode (like the traditional Zombies mode).
@CPaladino Essentially, a cutscene featuring the COD cast &amp; what looked like a World War Z cutscene. You can unlock an "Exo Zombies" mode
Whoa, there's a full-blown Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare! 
How do I know I picked the right dentist? We talked college football &amp; baseball during my dental work.

@KlayRule Yeah, poorly phrased tweet. Should have put "after next year" in my sentence. Regardless, he's a stud.
Joey Bosa of Ohio State may be a top 10 pick in the NFL draft next year. An absolute monster.
Bowling w/ @Kathryn_Ryan, &amp; she gets her highest score of 122. Bet that if she beat it, I'd buy her froyo. First frame, she bowls a strike.
@DMLFury Biggest things are having everyone at least be 27 (normal raid), having a good auto-rifle for Oracles &amp; great communication.
@DMLFury Cool. Made it through twice now, so I was going to offer some advice if you guys hadn't been through yet.
@DMLFury Has anyone in the group been through it?
@GrubbWVU @deaconblade I can't tonight. However, hit me up this weekend and I'll probably have time!
@BenWigdahl The Nash/Dirk/Finley era was fun to watch. Definitely miss that team.
@vicious696 While true, when healthy &amp; younger, he was incredible. Just sad that young kids will only remember him as "this" Nash.
It's sad that there are kids out there who don't realize how great Steve Nash was in his prime. All-time great court vision &amp; floor general.
@joe_lucas11 I've been at Planet Fitness for awhile, and I try to photo-bomb gym selfies whenever I can.
@joe_lucas11 Why do people even take their phone in the gym? Unless you're using it for music, leave it in the car. Kills me.
@Kathryn_Ryan This is what Toby would do if he weren't tiny.
The answer, to me, boils down to avoiding a PR mess. Glad to hear Mo'ne got this opportunity though: 
Mo'Ne Davis appeared in a Chevy commercial &amp; was paid, but the NCAA let's her keep eligibility. Why make exceptions for her &amp; not Gurley?
@hanyan21 I know we're playing the Texans, but this is pretty exciting. I miss seeing our team play with this much passion!
We literally just scored 24 points in 3 minutes. I don't know if I've ever seen that happen. #GoSteelers
After this ridiculously bad week in fantasy football, I deserve to see the Steelers pull off these past few plays. Unreal turn of events.
@VernNotice Don't want to spoil it for your followers, but the #boxcutter scene had me drop the F-bomb a few times. Incredible movie.
I hope that we never get rid of Antonio Brown. Unbelievable player. #GoSteelers
Regardless, yet another great article by @owengoodin. I recommend checking it out if you're interested in Live 15: 
Reportedly, he said that NBA gaming is a $350 million addressable market. That equals roughly 5.8 million. 2K sold 6-7 million last year.
It's great to hear O'Brien (EA) state that Live is coming at least 2 more years. However, he made a pretty big error in his quote.
@DMZilla Sad to see you leave, but excited to see what you end up doing next!
@iGreenTreeFrogg It's sort of crazy, honestly. I can't remember enjoying a game this much that had me playing missions over &amp; over.
@TooMuchHamza 100% chance of that. Can't say that I won't walk away injured though!
Crossing my fingers that I'm this athletic when I'm older. Also, stop recording videos vertically.


@JBHuskers Snagged Fenix. The UI is incredible, so I have a feeling it'll stick. Plus, it allows me to mute whatever hashtags flood my TL.

I've (gladly) paid $5 for a Twitter app &amp; switched my desktop app solely for the ability to mute a single hashtag.
The city planning in our college town is pretty strange. They chose to redo every sidewalk downtown now, instead of in the summer.

@VernNotice Mine was supposed to be "Dat Boi Dizzie" in 2002, but I misspelled it as "Dal Boi Dizzie" ... #RIP
@mrprice33 From small to major, they all felt like believable characters. So damn impressed with it.
Man, #GoneGirl was incredible.
@GoldGloveTV I haven't laughed this hard at a trade in a long time.
@GoldGloveTV #RIP to your heart: 
The Seahawks just traded Percy Harvin to the Jets for a condtional pick? #what
@mrprice33 Loved the Blake Griffin article. His quote at the bottom absolutely crushed it.
When my coworkers send an email about donuts in their office 2 hours away... 
@pkollar Your quote at the bottom should be "reviewed" &amp; not "reviewing", btw.
@MrComeBack_AcB That being said, they're both great. Just my personal preference.
@MrComeBack_AcB Ah, gotcha. I have both, but prefer the Xbox One. The "snap" feature is great &amp; I prefer the exclusives from MS.
@MrComeBack_AcB Are you on Xbox One or PS4?
@crecenteb #RIP
@Steve_OS I hope you won the game &amp; did the Nae-Nae.
@Donski3 Mostly due to my skills on the keytar.
That @kanyewest tweet I had that went viral a few weeks ago? Yeah, the creator of Mortal Kombat just retweeted it. Thanks @noobde!
@DMLFury Interested in how they handle it. If we can see past shows &amp; stream shows live.. that'd be huge. It'll likely be 1-day delay though
@MillenniumOS You know the answer.
@CMUchips @JayBilas I lost it when I read that. So good. 
@CMUchips @JayBilas Absolutely. Just finished reading that entire transcript on Deadspin. Lengthy, but worth reading.
Seeing the work that @JayBilas does for advocating collegiate athletes having certain compensation restrictions removed is incredible. Bravo
Or maybe this one. 
I'm trying to keep myself from buying this for our dog for Halloween. 
@aaronwatermelon Had no idea you cosplayed as a Hunter in Destiny.
@DMLFury Having played a raid, you don't want matchmaking for that thing. Requires people functioning as a team &amp; being very vocal.
@sparchief117 Received Chatterwhite &amp; Ascendant Energy. Was hoping for an exotic weapon though!
Whoa, that's a great teaser for next week's episode of #TheWalkingDead.
Bottle rockets will be prevalent in the apocalypse. #TheWalkingDead
Finally beat the @DestinyTheGame Vault of Glass raid thanks to @sparchief117!
Do any of my followers have face tattoos? Please say yes. I just don't get it.
Played &amp; won my first game of @NBA2K online today in MyTeam. Ran my offense, and scored 40 out of my 60 points in the paint while he shot 3s
@CPaladino Usually 3-4 minutes from start to finish for me. Needs a TON of light. Recommend a lamp without the shade to help.
@CPaladino Definitely. Installed on my XB1 &amp; it's easy to see the status there. Way too difficult to find out on the PS4.
@CPaladino On PS4? If so, you only are forced with that game until it finishes installing. Gives you "something to do" while it installs.
@Steve_OS They booted you for hacking, wasn't a server issue.
Whenever someone tells me there isn't a race or quality issue in the world, I'll point them here: 
Ubisoft used one of my favorite Childish Gambino tracks for a @FarCryGame trailer? Smart move. 
@BenWigdahl @bshifflett22 You guys pretty much said the same thing, haha. But yeah, there's no "trying" in that picture. Crushed his shot.
@KentuckyFan55 In Virginia? That's crazy.
My godfather inspired me to play ball. We shot every week, but today was the 1st pic I've ever seen of him playing. 
If you want to see someone with an identity crisis &amp; creating a crazy situation, check out what @mayhemmiller is doing right now.
@SMASHOLIPS @GoodGameBro @skeetnut We have someone that manages that account. Pleasure speaking with you.
@SMASHOLIPS @GoodGameBro @skeetnut If you'd click my profile you'd see that I own that website. Nice try though!
@SMASHOLIPS @GoodGameBro @skeetnut It was announced on Twitter &amp; both winners posted photos of their copies.
I literally can't breathe after watching Derrick Rose dance. 
@swadelandis Would probably be a bad time to go swimming. Be safe out there, Stu!
My hometown has some really strange people: 
Man, Bryce Harper has a thing for coming up clutch.
@owengood I think I'd watch a stream of you trying to get the face scan in #NBA2K15 to work for you for at least an hour.
Kill it with fire: 
@leftosa After looking at all the sliders/options in MyLeague, I just want to hug you.
@owengood "God, this is great!" would be my guess.
@mrprice33 Stream seems to be back up.
@WTF_OS Unfortunately, yeah.
ICYMI, my #NBA2K15 face-scan is spot on: 
Alright, I think my face scan came out perfect for #NBA2K15 
Is that you, Sam Cassell? #NBA2K15 
@AiiRxJONES If you're playing in Sunset Beach, then we're going to dominate The Park.
@shinobi602 Congrats! Keeping my fingers crossed for you.
@ScottOGallagher Just look for the #RaceChameleon in tiger pants.
@JosiahRenaudin Fitness goal?
@NickPuleo I typically watch footage of my favorite athlete(s) to get me going again. Helps remind me of my fitness goals.
I have Brady in 2 FF leagues. Received a ton of trades offering a QB for my RBs because I "had no QB". Oh, what was that again?
@Crucial_Vi You're going places. Extra crunchy is the only type of peanut butter that matters.
What's your favorite type (consistency) of peanut butter? There's only one answer.
@GoldGloveTV Can't wait. I've been watching NBA 2K15 gameplay non-stop: 
@AIRMCNEAR Appreciate it man! Let me know if we can figure out something for gameplay clips or other requests we may have!
@XboxQwik The folks at @GoodGameBro captured some amazing shots of Forza Horizon 2 as well: 
@AIRMCNEAR 
@AIRMCNEAR Just let me know, and thanks. Only looking for 6-8 minute clips. Happy birthday to your daughter!
@AIRMCNEAR Would give you credit and a shoutout in our uploaded video of it. Have a few teams in mind.
@AIRMCNEAR Could you capture some gameplay on PS4 using the Share button and send it my way using Dropbox or something?
@AIRMCNEAR What system? Would love to work out some exclusive gameplay from you in exchange for Twitter &amp; YouTube shoutouts from my site.
@AIRMCNEAR Hey man, did you snag an early copy of NBA 2K15 or something?
@Scomo843 It's for a random class. Bought it as a Hunter, and received a Warlock helmet.
After seeing the #NBA2K15 broadcast just now, all I can say is wow. Great work by the entire @NBA2K dev team on packing in features/modes!
@ScottOGallagher Yup. Deciding if I want those or if I'll buy a new pair of shoes for my winter league. Tough decisions!
Well, looks like I'm about to purchase another pair of shoes. 
Today is the LAST day to enter the @GoodGameBro #NBA2K15 giveaway. 
@CoreySA You already know the answer to this question.
Is Stevie Wonder pulling the greatest hoax ever? @bomani_jones kills it, too funny. 
Here's why Dwight Howard &amp; Kobe never worked out in LA: 
@mrprice33 Ouch. Yeah, the 1-3-1 cheese &amp; the constant dunk/3-pointer offense drove me away from playing head-to-head.
@mrprice33 If we play each other, there may be too much playcalling &amp; simulation for anyone's mind to comprehend. #simplosion
@mrprice33 Excited to be rewarded for making basketball plays this year. May mark my return to online play if I can dominate w/ a gameplan.
@mrprice33 If the extra pass was made to Lin, it would have been perfect execution. Can't wait to stretch defenses thin like this.
Today has been pretty crazy. On top of everything else, someone managed to get my debit card info &amp; made a fraud purchase. #thanksbro
@StephNunneley Bojangles.
@ScottOGallagher You've got your 2-guard right here.
@LD2K Great move. Looking forward to playing a ton of games in the Rec center. Stats or leaderboards for that area?
@JosiahRenaudin "Ghoulsiah Boonaudin" .... I'll see myself out.
@shinobi602 Have you seen these? A few incredible ones for sure. 
Please win this game, Kansas City. It'll make the trade the A's made to the Red Sox even more hilarious for us.
@DaveOshry New promo code for Gunnars?
BREAKING: Google reports rise in "What is Ebola?" searches from US citizens.
@mrprice33 Not saying it's a great deal, but it's telling that the Cavs initiated the contact. I wouldn't give up on Waiters yet.
@mrprice33 That trade would open up a Ray Allen at SG signing with a few minutes per game taken by Miller though, right?
@mrprice33 Think that trade goes through before the season? Have a feeling that's a Jan/Feb deal, if it happens.
Another great video by @Da_Czar. The backdoor finish by Leonard at 4:40 is a thing of beauty. 
@JosiahRenaudin Nice. I have a Lenovo at work, and it's been pretty durable.
@JosiahRenaudin What'd you get?
@The_Youth_Move Yeah, right on Old Furnace Road.
How many prank calls do they receive? 
@israeljcruz You're just going to use @CoreySA's profile pic like that? #cold
@Ty_Stover Interesting. Maybe that article/photo was just a joke?
@MillenniumOS Take a few steps up in the pocket &amp; throw a loft pass in front of them.
@MaiaAlexis143 #RIP
@FunnyPicsDepot I appreciate you guys stealing my tweet &amp; not giving credit: 
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Appreciate the heads up. Called them out, though I'm sure it won't do anything.
Well, that's a first. @FunnyPicsDepot stole my tweet verbatim. Their tweet: 
@jglovier @jzy Kung Lao always wins.
@ErinOmaha Definitely paid off. Really enjoyed him in "Mud", but I'm behind on his other newer films. Can't wait for Interstellar though!
@NewYorkRic 
@NewYorkRic BRB, I'm heading to New York for an undisclosed reason...
Apparently #NERF guns now have cameras built-in. Why can't I be a kid now? 
@hanyan21 Can't stand reality TV, haha. Life became a lot easier when we got rid of cable &amp; just focused on Hulu/Netflix/Amazon.
@hanyan21 Just as much blame falls on the audience that watches the channel. Networks go with what their audience supports/views.
My Kanye tweet from earlier is blowing up. Appreciate all the RTs! 
@WTF_OS Is that 2K14 or 2K15?
@DtoidChris Ah, had a feeling. Would offer to participate if we were on the same console.
@DtoidChris What system are you playing on?
Kanye West as he enters the Mortal Kombat tournament. 
@4everVersatile @GoodGameBro That's too bad. Managed to snag an exotic and quite a few pieces of legendary gear.
@JoelEmbiid You've got Rihanna now though.
NBA 2K15's "Momentous" trailer is a work of art. Game looks incredible AND they used A Tribe Called Quest. 
Happy birthday to @wepeeler! You still haven't beaten me in FIFA, and you never will! #becauseweveneverplayed
Walmart cashier asked the guy in front of me what creatine was. Kid explained it, though he's real skinny, &amp; cashier gave him the side eye.
#TweetAtYourself10YearsAgo Stop wearing jorts.
@PrestoFriend531 For Titanfall? Nope, not yet.
@MaddenBible #99Combover
I'm not saying Vaughn will be exceptional, but I'm willing to give an actor the chance to prove their chops.
Hell, Matthew McConaughey was thought of as a "terrible" actor until he made the jump into a "serious" role a few before True Detective.
To the people complaining about Vince Vaughn in True Detective, I'm sure you thought the same of Woody Harrelson before his serious roles.
@hernleyt @CoachTomlin Happy to see Harrison back for one final season. His leadership will help out our young group once they're healthy.
The Golden State Warriors are going to be playing in a toilet. 
Over 2,000 entries &amp; counting for our @NBA2K giveaway on @GoodGameBro. Time is running out to enter! 
@ClintOldenburg That site only creates satirical posts. Definitely not real.
@EAMaddenNFL Knile Davis
@owengood Wait until you hit level 20 or so. That's when you get the most out of it.
That Ron Rivera stare needs to be a GIF before the end of the night.
#GoSteelers
@MartyyyMcFlyyy LOL, the bumble bee version is too crazy.
@ClintOldenburg Genius.
I'm not really a "jersey guy" &amp; I'm saving for a wedding, but it's been tough the past few months to not buy an Antonio Brown jersey.
@SimFBallCritic I was looking all over the screen when he threw the first pump fake. Incredible touch on that pass.
What a touchdown. #GoSteelers
@bshifflett22 My "knowledge" being pure BS, haha.
Before the game, I called that Knile Davis would hit 125 yards rushing against the Dolphins. He's already at 70.
I thought Kirk Cousins was way better than RG3...? 
Glad to see Jeremy Maclin finally healthy &amp; able to contribute.
Austin Davis is tearing up the Dallas Cowboys' defense? 
@Jstein2469 Fairly certain that was a rocket catch by Dalton.
@WTF_OS Andy Dalton had the rocket catch there, no doubt.
@bshifflett22 I could see that. I live Davis though. Was electric at Arkansas, and I love seeing him get time to shine.
@loudmouthjulia Great choice. My contract is up in November, so I'm looking for a new Android phone as well. Enjoy it!
NFL Sunday kicks off in a few minutes. What's your bold prediction for today? I'm guessing Knile Davis goes for 125+ yards.
@loudmouthjulia What Android phone did you go with?
In true Harrisonburg fashion, I hit up Bojangles tonight. I may eat all 12 pieces of chicken &amp; each of the six biscuits.
Happy birthday, @immarcusking. Can't believe you're 18! 
@mroahrig I think we'll see something drastic. Sponsors put the pressure on, so it'll be a long 1-2 years for them to turn it around.
@mroahrig Very few sports offer that outside of football, baseball &amp; basketball which is why they're the top 3 sports, financially.
@mroahrig Won't happen. Neither are as lucrative for companies. Football is filled with largely Americans who are followed since high school
Yo, what is happening?! Someone screaming during the Goodell conference?
Last thing regarding Goodell: He's not going anywhere unless sponsors pull out or the NFL loses money.
The thing I'm taking away from Goodell's press conference is that the media doesn't seem to be buying his speech &amp; comments.
That being said, his fallback is definitely putting the blame on himself. Not fully sold on that, but the public generally eats that up.
Granted Goodell did create the majority of this storm, he represents a large group of people that also made mistakes.
People will certainly rip on Goodell today, but I can't imagine having that sort of composure under these conditions.
@RobSemsey Thankful that @CoreySA  added all of the tracks on @Spotify. Enjoying it a lot!  
Someone please explain to me how a 7-foot, 380 pound high school football player hasn't received college interest: 
@Steve_OS @leftosa @Shady00018 You guys snagged @JaoSming too?! Unreal. Incredible team over at 2K now!
@Jstein2469 Only if it's Julio.
@R3D_STAR Dougs have feelings!
@godfree @vicious696 I've been playing on lunch breaks &amp; before work. It's crazy.
@DaveOshry Been great to watch your story, Dave. Glad to see your hard work paying off!
@pkollar Not sure if you're interested in running this, but someone beat the Destiny raid in under 2 hours: 
@hilgoldstein Sadly, people didn't appreciate him towards the end of his tenure. He did a TON to push the game forward. Not easy at all.
@Nick_Mudry Good luck, Nick!
@mattbertz ..... so, it was mostly accurate? #shotsfired
@mattbertz RB6V took your image &amp; put it on a model. This looks to actually use 3D-mapping technology.
@mattbertz I'm really hoping someone does one for Desmond Bryant: 
Looks like @DestinyTheGame sold at least 5 million copies in its first 5 days. I'd say that's a success.
@aaronwatermelon #WWDOD
@aaronwatermelon Those eggs have muscles. They give you muscles. You want muscles, right?
How I felt when I found out @Kathryn_Ryan ate the last 3 homemade cookies.... 
When the @DestinyTheGame servers don't connect, they give you the error code "marionberry". So, the Destiny servers are smoking crack?
@WesPhillips @hofftv She'll be at the Red Hat Amphitheater, right? Love that venue. Watched the fireworks display there on the 4th!
Musiq Soulchild is...... rapping now? .......why? This feels like a real-life Boondocks episode.
ESPN has a Randy Moss 30 for 30 debuting on November 11th at 8PM. Can't wait to see them examine one of the greatest receivers ever.
4 albums I'll never get enough of: Camp by @donaldglover, M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, Lorde's Pure Heroine &amp; KL's Good Kid, mAAd City.
I'm done with my soapbox though. Please go back to your regularly scheduled programming of being mad about trivial things that don't matter.
Felt good to go back on the memories despite not being a good friend to him the past few years. I'll miss you, Pete. Thanks for everything.
Took a trip back to my hometown for a few hours to reminisce at old hangout spots, the court we played basketball on &amp; his old house.
Thinking back on it, he was the reason I watched Dragonball Z, used the word "crucial", bought my first walkie-talkie, and so much more.
Lost a cousin &amp; childhood friend this weekend. Had only spoken once this year, and I'm a bit ashamed that I was "too busy" to keep talking.
Shoutout to everyone who started Matt Ryan this week thinking he was "back".
If RGIII felt bad about the injury, wait until he sees what Kirk Cousins is doing on the field.
@shinobi602 Here are a few tips on beating him: 
@loudmouthjulia Had zero knowledge of that movie until the trailer. Now, I kind of want to see it.
<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> "@DeShayDavon: My granny two pieced my cousin one day for lying and saying he took a bath. He's a better man today for it."
When you boot up @EAMaddenNFL, you may see a @GoodGameBro screenshot in the loading screens. Let me know if you see it!
@pkollar Sounds good. Looking forward to reading the review tomorrow, Phil! Holding mine until I get a better taste of the "end game".
@pkollar Are you guys planning to re-visit the review once raids are available next week?
Hoping that either #NBA2K15 or #NBALive15 has CDR wearing his short-shorts this year: 
Would love to see @EAMaddenNFL add a feature like this for DB/WR interactions: 
If you're planning to buy an Apple Watch at $350 or more, I have a bridge that I'd like to sell you.
Apple Watch is definitely great tech, but they haven't shown a "killer app" that should make consumers want to buy it.
@EASPORTSNBA What modes will #NBALive15 feature?
We live in a world where people only want to hear an opinion if it supports their thoughts or builds up what they're doing.
@BenKuchera Still hoping we see a ME collection announced at the VGAs this year for a Spring release. #pipedream
Who has more picks: Tony Romo or the Philadelphia 76ers?
#ShouldHaveDraftedManziel 
Thank you, Shaun Suisham! #GoSteelers
@hernleyt Yeah. TD got called back, but our offense looked pretty great against a much improved Cleveland defense.
Had 8-8 hopes for my Steelers this year, but man... we're looking great to start the year!
You literally called this. RT @KBReal21: What a great game to end an awesome Saturday! I see a VT pick 6 to end this one.
I should probably go to sleep, but watching Virginia Tech lose their lead &amp; fall apart is too entertaining.
@ScottOGallagher Ed O'Bannon
@GoldGloveTV #GoldysOFace
@JDewiel @Steve_OS No way he goes to the Texans now since they traded for Mallett.
@JDewiel @SimFBallCritic @Steve_OS I don't see Bill Cowher going to the Cowboys if he has any respect for the Steelers....
@JDewiel @MaddenBible @EASPORTS_AJ I love my team, but I'm not stupid. Fans of the Browns would murder me in that stadium, lol.
@JDewiel @Steve_OS If Gordon weren't suspended, Miles would play a role like Hines did. Go across the middle, 3rd downs, etc.
@JDewiel @MaddenBible @EASPORTS_AJ Haha, I'm heading back there this year. We can't all live within an hour of our team.
@Steve_OS @JDewiel I think he'll be a really reliable target if he stays healthy. Definitely a shame he had so many injuries in Dallas.
@MaddenBible @JDewiel @EASPORTS_AJ Both parents are die-hard fans of the Steelers, so they've been my team since birth. I've been to a game!
@JDewiel How do you feel about your WRs? I think you'll be alright as long as Miles is healthy. Cameron should get a crazy amount of targets
@JDewiel 43. I had a few alterations to my hair, so you can't miss me.
@JDewiel Looking forward to helping you start your season off with a loss on Sunday!
Marshawn Lynch is in the driver's seat tonight. 
@NickPuleo @godfree @vicious696 Absolutely. Tried every so often over the past month or so, but no luck. Still picking up my copy 9/9 though
@NickPuleo @godfree @vicious696 No response back from Step-3 for me either. They're usually fantastic about getting back ASAP to us.
@CoreySA #UFookinWotM8
@CoreySA Can't imagine how rough that is. I was struggling just taking my nephew to school, lol.
Russell Wilson looks like you wouldn't let him around small children: 
@czach1r @iliv3forthis I like to look back on our band &amp; remember Ryan's mullet.
@Airweldon He's wearing one this year. Stated it on Twitter and Instagram.
Friends in Northern VA/DC, anyone down for meeting me for dinner tonight in Arlington?
The Warriors signing McAdoo is probably the best place for him. He'll get a chance to play &amp; give energy off the bench in limited minutes.
@Shake4ndBake Excited for you man! That's huge!
@Ty_Stover Glad to hear it. Looking forward to you guys dropping more footage &amp; news soon.
@Ty_Stover Regardless, his model looks great. I've just expected to see the headband or something on social regarding on/off with it.
@Ty_Stover Going off this story (passed to the team as well) from his Instagram. 
@Steve_OS Still no headband for Lillard, their cover athlete.
@godfree @vicious696 I love Android devices, but the Ouya is just a weird ploy. Also, Danny.. be careful or your iCloud photos may leak!
@vicious696 @godfree The Ouya has so much potential. #thingsnoonesays
@AgentM Here's a great review to check out, Ryan: 
@michaelpachter Sorry to hear about that. Glad that she wasn't in pain. My condolences to your family!
That play by Jameis Winston was nothing short of incredible. Wow.
I love being able to pull off sick user-catches like this in @EAMaddenNFL this year. 
@owengood @ImCAntonio Stop dodging me and add in the tattoos right now.....
@owengood Why don't all the players have their tattoos?! SAME OLD EA.............
.@AdamSchefter Hey man, you make good money. PLEASE pay someone to update your Twitter background. 
@SMASHOLIPS @GoodGameBro @ProChicagoBears Since he completed all 3 required entries, the spreadsheet the data goes in showed us his info.
@Skiffington_ Whoa. When did this become a thing? Open to everyone or apply for access?
Amazon Prime's upcoming original show "Transparent" is showing a lot of promise. 
@EASPORTS_MUT Just a heads up, but Akeem Jordan (MLB, Washington) has the incorrect picture in MUT for his card art.
@DMLFury Make sure to do the Skills Trainer. It should help catch you up.
If @JoelEmbiid plays like he tweets, give him the MVP trophy already.
Couldn't be more proud of @JosiahRenaudin after his @EAMaddenNFL review hit the front page of @gamespot! 
@DevinKofsky I thought people in Miami just drove that fast?
@Jstein2469 That's true. Pretty sure I'm grabbing Wright in two of my leagues just to be safe.....
@Jstein2469 Makes me wonder if Gronk isn't even close to being healthy. Don't they have about 4-5 TEs now?
@Jstein2469 Still shocked. What's the story on Tim Wright?
@Jstein2469 Soo.... your Bucs are starting to look really good.
Definitely recommend downloading the Hyperlapse app. It's something new from the people at @Instagram. 
@Cam_Rellim12 Avoid Reservoir, University Blvd &amp; Port Republic for the next 8-9 months.
Amazon has purchased Twitch for $970 million. Huge congratulations to both companies! 
@MUTGuru Also found this: 
@MUTGuru Can't find the tweet yet, but I found this: 
@supererogatory With Twitch doing the music concert recently, there's a lot of potential for Amazon here.
If Amazon truly does purchase Twitch, that's going to do a lot for pushing it into a mainstream audience. I'm fine with Amazon or Google.
@notaxation Definitely. I love listening to the show, so I was happy to hear your take &amp; appreciate you explaining things to others.
@notaxation Really enjoyed your points on #Ferguson. Nick didn't seem to get it, but without experiencing hate/oppression, you don't know.
Watching cartoons with my nephew before I take him to school. Hard to believe this kid is already in kindergarten.
@HANDSWARD_EA Best players on offense &amp; defense so far?
Though it sucks the lady flaked out on us, @Kathryn_Ryan did step in dog poop. So, I guess you can say the trip was worth it.
@israeljcruz Definitely. We were looking at a miniature poodle a lady posted on Craigslist. Multiple emails, but didn't show up. Frustrating
We drive 30 minutes to look at a potential 2nd dog, and the lady flakes out on us. Didn't show up and didn't respond to emails.
Looking at a potential 2nd dog @Kathryn_Ryan found on Craigslist. If I don't tweet in a few hours, we were murdered near a golf course.
Whoa, @ScottOGallagher AND @Da_Czar are working on NBA 2K15's gameplay team now? That's huge. Congrats!
How do I know it's Friday? Because @JLaudy is singing a Rebecca Black song in the office.
@nickchester Have you actually heard what Floyd sounds like reading? Man... 
Rusney Castillo is coming to the Red Sox?! Great news for solving our issue in centerfield.

Just watched the #KajiemePowell shooting video a few times. Things in St. Louis just don't seem to be getting better. Damn.
@TheeJohnnyB Good luck, John!
@IzzySnowHD @Shake4ndBake No idea on the time. I'd expect some time in the early morning tomorrow, however.
@Shake4ndBake 100% sure. That's the embargo date that @EASPORTS_AJ informed myself &amp; a few others of for reviews, streaming, etc.
@Shake4ndBake It's 3:01 Eastern.
@Scomo843 Definitely agree. There are quite a few YouTubers that do it &amp; companies don't even realize it.
@Scomo843 There are a TON of people with fake followers. Easiest way to check is look at how many RTs &amp; favorites they received recently.
@NewYorkRic With the special edition "Gloria" colorway.
@NewYorkRic Have you picked up Delonte's House "Wet Willy" Slippers though?
@NewYorkRic Glad that you're supporting the best player on the planet.
@DtoidChris While true, most of the outrage seems to come from users who previously had Season Ticket w/ a 3-day trial.
Probably the best commercial you'll ever see: 
@owengood Seeing @darrenrovell unknowingly tweet out the "Shocker" sign just made my day.
@aubradley84 Congratulations, Brad!
@TheRealBIGDOOKY Soon! We'll be stepping up our stream game soon to celebrate the launch. ;)

When you guys see what @Kevin26385 &amp; I have come up with for Madden &amp; @GoodGameBro .... Oh boy. Coming shortly!
@D_Hiatus Sounds like you haven't been watching @GoodGameBro recently!
Someone witnessed Michael Brown get shot &amp; live-tweeted the whole situation. 
@MaddenAllstars No problem. Appreciate the cooperation!
@MaddenAllstars Thanks for taking it down. As a heads up, it's NOT okay to use any of the @GoodGameBro content. We'll report all of it.
@MaddenAllstars Expect a copyright claim on your stolen footage in 3.... 2.... 1.....
The 'Madden Season' commercial for @EAMaddenNFL 15 is kind of crazy, but it's perfect at the same time. 
@R3D_STAR @primagames Whoa, you're leaving Prima Games? Best of luck wherever you're heading next!
ICYMI: We uploaded a TON of @EAMaddenNFL 15 content on @GoodGameBro today - 

#GGB 
Danny Almonte had me glued to the TV when he pitched in the LLWS. Such a bizarre story: 
@artistxforever @mroahrig Yeah, screencaps went viral earlier.. so he must have caught wind &amp; changed it again.
@mroahrig He has now changed his name on Facebook to "Scooby Willman" &amp; comments on how "no one will find him" under that name.
We're dropping 24 @EAMaddenNFL 15 videos on @GoodGameBro today at 12PM Eastern. Get ready!
@VernNotice You just took the pudding game to a whole different level. #bravo
@VernNotice Eat some pudding. Life is instantly better.
Out of curiosity, are any outlets or editors that follow me reviewing Metro: Redux? Have a question I'd like to ask.
@Scomo843 @ERockMUT Ha, I only use the app now. Works like a charm!
@Scomo843 Try UPS My Choice. It's a great way to get updates on where packages are &amp; when you'll receive them.
@bpmarkowitz Can't confirm on MNF or TNF games, but for those that aren't there.. I just stream them online elsewhere.
@bpmarkowitz Can't remember. However, you can now get Sunday ticket on your Xbox One: 
@bpmarkowitz Essentially, anything that they show on ESPN3 can be viewed without login credentials to an ISP. Big events as well (SB, MM).
@bpmarkowitz Used to be part of Xbox Live Gold ($60), but you may be able to access it without the subscription now.
@bpmarkowitz Yup. I cut the cable 2 years ago, and use ESPN on my Xbox One. If it's not there, I use a European streaming site to watch.
@GoldGloveTV #RIP
@_SeanLawrence_ Yeah, you'll need to PM me on our forums. ;)
The PC version of NBA 2K15 will be on-par with the PS4 &amp; Xbox One versions? Great news!
So, basically, that PT game on PSN features Norman Reedus &amp; possibly Ryan Gosling in a new Silent Hill by Kojima &amp; del Toro? Okay.
@NewYorkRic Do you think I'm just gonna sit there &amp; let you kill me?
@NewYorkRic I'm here. I'm here. You're just the fakest person. I actually admire that you can actually be this fake.
@DaveOshry @on3nightstan Geometry Wars 3 is apparently coming this holiday season. King's Quest is 2015.
@AiiRxJONES All I can say to that is... 
@DMZilla @OpTicMiDNiTE Just checked out a few of her videos &amp; I enjoyed them. Subscribing, so thanks!
@DMZilla For reference, what's a video that you feel did it the best?
@GoldGloveTV DayZ is a "timed exclusive" for PS4. It'll be on Xbox One, just not sure how long before it arrives.
@AiiRxJONES Bringing nothing but the cheese, lol.
@RapSheet Josh Wells was a QB in high school, oddly enough.
@DaveOshry Rise of the Triad is coming to the Wii U.
@Heat_Of_Knights They called out a "Fall 2014" date on the announcement, so people would lose their minds if that happened.
@ovfd55 True. Still holding out for an announcement by them this week.
Very surprised that neither Sony or Microsoft revealed the GTA V XB1/PS4/PC release date. Have to assume it's coming in November now.
@AiiRxJONES I hope you're ready for some #streakcheese when Madden drops &amp; #wingcheese when 2K &amp; Live are out!
@leftosa They don't taste very good.... 
@leftosa I love food, so I expect that to happen when/if I get out to Novato!
@leftosa Not a fan of onions, but everything else sounds great. The restaurant was called "Roti", sort of a "grill" place.
@leftosa On the right food, I'm okay with Feta cheese. Had it at this Mediterranean place two years ago &amp; it was great.
@leftosa Please don't include any Greek yogurt in MyLeague.
Here's the first information regarding Sierra Games &amp; Geometry Wars 3: 
@TheRealBIGDOOKY @CoreySA The texture was just too much. Mouth felt incredibly dry with each bite.
@Iamdnitro Can't wait for Gears on XB1, but I have a feeling it won't launch until 2016. Just wanting the team to take their time!
Geometry Wars 3 has been announced by Sierra Games. Coming to Xbox Live, PSN &amp; PC!
Tons of great news by @XboxP3 &amp; team this morning for the Xbox One. Definitely impressed by their briefing's announcements &amp; games.
If you're able to eat Greek yogurt &amp; enjoy it, props to you. Never again.
Speedrunners is coming to Xbox One?!? Game over.
@deaconblade Told you!
@SmittyD1981 Multiplayer is a lot of fun if you like slow/stealth. Bow &amp; arrow is a lot of fun to use.
I've had The Last of Us Remastered for week or so, but I can't stop playing the multiplayer. Too good. Needing to start the story soon.
Glad to see 2K confirm that @ScottOGallagher has joined the team. Broke that story in June, but can't wait to see his impact!
@DaveOshry Met him at Dead Space event in 08. Said hey in the terminal &amp; we chatted for awhile. Every thing he said felt like he was flexing

Watch - 
@fire714 @NameisChase Seems pretty plausible that it'll be on sale tomorrow. Official announcement should come pretty early tomorrow though.
@ExtremeGamer @bgamer90 That's all I know for now. I'm assuming you'll still need a PC, but we'll know tomorrow. Can't wait.
The @elgatogaming announcement tomorrow is the HD60. Includes webcam support &amp; overlays. Day one buy. 
@Heat_Of_Knights @GoodGameBro Definitely appreciate it. We're going to put a lot of effort into our forums, so hopefully we see you there!
@Heat_Of_Knights @GoodGameBro Thanks for the heads up. I'll see if we can get other users to test it to make sure it's functional.
@Heat_Of_Knights @GoodGameBro Ah, good. You're saying that "Playstation 4" or "PS4" didn't work though?
@Heat_Of_Knights @GoodGameBro Did you sign up as "HeatofKnights"? If so, I see your account as logged in &amp; valid.
@christophjohnso I was just never drawn in. Felt like certain characters tried too hard &amp; came off unnatural. Let me know what you think!
@christophjohnso Watched the first episode last Sunday, wasn't too impressed. Worth watching the next few episodes?
@hernleyt Showed promise. I'd like to see him in action in one more game before I would choose him over Carter.
@bpmarkowitz Pretty sure I'm spotting the early stages of a mullet.
Fantastic run by Manziel, but he needs to learn to tuck the football to avoid open-field fumbles.
Is it September 27th yet? Can't wait. 
The @ATLHawks just tweeted (unprovoked) about a @GoodGameBro article that @mrprice33 wrote. So sick &amp;thanks! 

Pretty cool.
@Futterish Thank you!
@Futterish Thanks, Michael!
@Futterish You had mentioned sourcing me if I was correct on O'Gallagher joining 2K. Here's your confirmation: 
@stephensonmc Yup. It's going to make for an interesting October 7th &amp; an even more interesting Live 16/NBA 2K16 battle.
Reported this 1st in June, but @ScottOGallagher has officially left EA SPORTS &amp; is now an NBA 2K15 Gameplay Producer: 
Dropping an interesting piece of sports gaming news shortly...
If taking your kid to get a haircut is anything like taking your dog to get groomed, I'm filming it.
@rytherb Also known as "Hoodbridge".
@rytherb Oh, you're coming to the greatest state in the country? Make sure you stop at a diner.
@GoldGloveTV Have you thought about watermarking your vids to deter it somewhat? People will still do it, unfortunately, but adds work.
A friend of mine recently had her 5 year old daughter diagnosed with cancer. Please donate if you can, RTs work too! 
@EASPORTS_MUT, please find a way to get Ladainian Tomlinson in as a legendary player. I'd love you forever.
@leftosa Sick. Looking forward to reading the interview &amp; hearing more information soon!
@Da_Czar @leftosa Nice. Looking forward to reading up on the mode. Is it October yet?
@leftosa Haven't been able to read the article yet, but is this a replacement for Association or in addition to it?
Somehow survived a bootcamp in downtown Arlington with my coworkers. Time for wings!
This is how I imagine @Kathryn_Ryan when we have kids. 
@randomlyrossy @JosiahRenaudin I look forward to your tweets of you freaking out in Season 2.
@randomlyrossy Wait until you hit Season 2.
@MillenniumOS Slightly worried since we're a month out from launch with no real details/confirmation on it.
@MillenniumOS I play NHL solely for OTP, honestly. FIFA is fun, but I split my time between pro clubs &amp; co-op seasons.
@MillenniumOS Neither.
This Vine is perfect. 
@Zzcoolj21 Definitely. Anxious to have both titles out this year &amp; seeing their respective communities grow.
Lots of people talking negatively about 2K after that stream. I look forward to seeing you all praising the trailer &amp; buying it on 10/7.
Can't breathe. 
@JosiahRenaudin Only items I use my Kinect for recently are start/stopping Netflix, recording a game clip &amp; going to certain apps.
@JosiahRenaudin Glad that Scottie is openly admitting he's the greatest Chicago Bulls' player of all-time.
Signed off without saying "bye" late last night while Skyping with my coworkers. I wake up to this: 
@on3nightstan My Elgato has recorded a TON of footage &amp; helped with YouTube/streaming so much. Anxious to see what's up next!
@on3nightstan Looking forward to the Elgato announcement, Stan!
Can't wait. RT @elgatogaming: #ElgatoNext August 11, 2014. 
Madden NFL 15 Xbox One bundle for $399 on 8/26 &amp; a white Sunset Overdrive Xbox One bundle on 10/28 (price not confirmed).
Looks like @EAMaddenNFL &amp; @Xbox are teaming up to launch an Xbox One + Madden NFL 15 bundle: 
@GoldGloveTV Thanks for coming by the stream early tonight!

Join us - 
@deaconblade @peterocc @DevinKofsky Being mixed too, it works pretty well for me.
@DevinKofsky @deaconblade I started doing it after seeing that @peterocc was a fine. I even use their shave butter &amp; post-shave now.
@deaconblade Yup. Been doing the mid-tier for awhile now, and it saves me a lot of money.
#RIP Busta Rhymes 
@ovfd55 Absolutely. Planning to make some changes to our forums before launch, so we'll need feedback &amp; people to recruit new members!
Can not wait to kick off the @EAMaddenNFL coverage on @GoodGameBro in a few weeks. Tons of videos &amp; editorials coming your way!
Witnessed two things at this wedding: Colonel Sanders clone &amp; guy dressed up but wearing a Redskins flat-brim hat.
@DeShayDavon Don't watch it. You'll never run again.
@DeShayDavon 
@DeShayDavon McGahee? #NeverForget
Not playing basketball or jumping for weeks. Paul George's injury will scar me just like Shaun Livingston's did.
Paul George's injury just made me yell. Absolutely terrible, and I hope he recovers.
@NickPuleo Looks good, but I feel like it's missing that "must-click" item.
@JLaudy Tweeting at yourself? What a celebrity!
@ShayPomeroy Loved those books as a kid.
@DeShayDavon Expect plenty of Madden 15 footage to drop on @GoodGameBro before the game launches.
@HANDSWARD_EA I think it's time for me to take another trip to Fenway Park. So excited to see him play there.
@ZAN_4PM Yeah, and he'll have a good dynamic with Ortiz. Having them go 3/4 brings back the Manny/Ortiz effect of years past!
@HANDSWARD_EA Cespedes has had a pretty sub-par July (last 7gm have been good though), but can't believe he did this. Love it as a Sox fan!
@ZAN_4PM Nevermind, he's just eligible for arbitration after the 2015 season. I read it incorrectly.
@ZAN_4PM Cespedes is a free agent after the 2015 season though, right?
I'll love this Lester for Cespedes trade as long as we get Lester back through free agency. #RedSox
@GoldGloveTV Take vitamin-B after drinking heavily to keep a hangover from happening. Works like a charm!
@EAMaddenNFL What's Tim Tebow's OVR rating &amp; speed?
@EAMaddenNFL What's Calvin Johnson's punt rating?
I don't think I could be more excited for Interstellar after seeing the new trailer: 
@Paakaa10 @Jstein2469 I may or may not be joining you guys on multiplayer soon....
Remember when Snapchat declined Facebook's $3 billion buyout? They're preparing for a $10 billion evaluation. #smart
High of 78 degrees today, and for the 2nd day in a row... our company has the heat on full blast. #PleaseSendHelp
Wrist is jacked up, made my pulled hamstring worse, and the cut on my toe is in even worse shape now. I'm getting old.
Always good to run into Mr. Ehlers when I visit my old high school. One of my favorite people there.
@christmuss_ I've never actually been. Probably a bit too crazy for me, honestly. Would love to sit in on some of the panels though!
@geoffkeighley @andrew_reiner Sports games will be open, but titles like BF, Dragon Age, etc. would likely be blocked off after a point.
@TaikeinCooper He's no TJ Yates.....
@JayBilas That explains why Leinart had such great footwork in the pocket.
@JayBilas That's better than Leinart's "ballroom dancing" class his last year.
Shut it down. The greatest music video ever has been produced. 
It's July, and the heat is on full blast in our office. #SendHelp
Shoutout to the greatest quarterback to ever play in the NFL, @TimTebow: 
Old, but good. My greatest comeback in @EAMaddenNFL against @Kevin26385. Down 17 in the 4th! 
@aaronwatermelon @BigPete7978 Here's the link to the story I remember reading: 
@BenKuchera Mine is focused around stamina, so I aim for 10k steps a day. Hard to get each day, but pushes you outside of normal limits.
@aaronwatermelon @BigPete7978 Big issue for me is that they touted each planet to be larger than Halo: Reach. Doesn't seem so now.
Only one explorable area per planet in Destiny? Expect the media backlash to begin this week.

Full list - 
@NwG_SnakeEyes Thanks! I need to know the forums you'll need setup, league name, etc. Join our forums &amp; then PM "WhoIsDo" w/ details.
@aarongreenberg Customized via NikeID or truly customized specifically for you? Regardless, those are sick!
Journey is officially coming to Playstation 4, as Sony will be bringing it to Gamescom next month.
Are any of my followers planning to attend Gamescom next month? If so, let me know!
@raczilla Switched gamertags when I bought my PS4. Wanted to keep things uniform.
@raczilla Make sure to add "WhoIsDo" on your PS4! The Show is really good though. Trying to make the Atros a contender atm &amp; it's tough.
@raczilla Lots of the Destiny beta &amp; MLB 14 The Show. May possibly squeak in Payday 2 on Steam. You?
@MaiaAlexis143 "sup girl?"
If you've ever wanted an excuse to laugh at me... 

Full list - 
They're now spamming me with my most embarrassing sports moment: 
My coworkers are spamming me with the following GIFs: 
That moment when your coworkers find your YouTube channel, make a ton of GIFs, and your boss sends you one.
@JosiahRenaudin Double fight? I haven't even looked at the card. Who else is on it?
@JosiahRenaudin Whoa, Gus is out and they're putting Cormier in?! That's huge.
Donald Sterling filed ANOTHER lawsuit? Where are those of you who said I was wrong &amp; that he would "go quietly"?
@PappyShannon Record number of base hits will go to the shortstop hole against the Yankees.
@Faperture Likewise!
@Faperture Enjoy building communities &amp; connecting with people. Been fortunate to help springboard writers to big outlets, which is a bonus.
This kid will dominate college football highlights this year &amp; be dubbed the next Adrian Peterson: 
@LLSMUVG Wouldn't have it any other way!
Worked 7-5 with no lunch, drove 40+ minutes to hoop, got home &amp; I'm back to working for both my real job &amp; @GoodGameBro. Is it Friday yet?
@czach1r We HAVE to play this soon.
@GameStop @shinobi602 Can't tell if that's Mass Effect or Assassin's Creed...
@vicious696 Would make sense for it to release April-June next year, with ME4 (won't be the name) launching in holiday 2016.
Hoping that @bioware announces a Mass Effect collection for XB1 &amp; PS4 at Comic-Con this weekend. I can dream, right?
Count me in. Definitely an opening night viewing. 
@WTF_OS @Kathryn_Ryan That's how I expected 90% of my followers to respond.
Just helped @Kathryn_Ryan hook up a VCR. What year is it again?
@scnolan13 @mroahrig @JosiahRenaudin @Skiffington_ Visited frequently after I parted ways, saw it's condition, and refuse to go back now. :/
@JosiahRenaudin @Skiffington_ @mroahrig @scnolan13 Yup! Used my own keyboard &amp; monitor. Just bought a 2nd monitor about 2 weeks ago.
@Skiffington_ @mroahrig @JosiahRenaudin @scnolan13 Max put together a great PC for me at $800-850, and I LOVE it.
@JosiahRenaudin @scnolan13 As @mroahrig once screamed at me on social media, "Just build a PC!"
@RealSkipBayless Stop it.
@iliv3forthis We'll definitely need to play Destiny soon!
@ShayPomeroy Was making dinner &amp; thought the same. It's rough to have a Sunday without something great to watch before Monday!
Found a really cool trick in the Destiny beta last night: 
@aaronwatermelon @mroahrig Every single time that I stream, someone jumps in chat &amp; asks me if I'm a late night TJ or related to Tay Zonday.
@aaronwatermelon Let me know if you want to try &amp; make it there today. I'll be on PSN soon (&amp; streaming).
@aaronwatermelon Here's what happens if you get past it: 
Congratulations to @yarisgutierrez on the birth of his son!
Check out the new @DestinyTheGame apparel in the mall. #thattigerdoe 
Million dollar idea: Women's clothing store with a section that includes video games, wireless, ESPN, and couches.
 
Join us - 
@yarisgutierrez Keeping you guys in my thoughts for a great delivery. Pre-congrats!
Madden 15 achievements/trophies: 30% MUT, 26% CFM, 16% skills trainer, 15% gameplay, 13% other.
A little over 30% of the achievements/trophies in Madden NFL 15 have to do with Madden Ultimate Team.
@vicious696 @deaconblade It's too early to be drinking, Daylon.
@deaconblade Hoping that it arrives before September 9th!
@deaconblade That's nice, but I really would have preferred a screenshot feature at this point.
The @NFL2K Twitter account couldn't be more perfect, honestly.
@JosiahRenaudin Wow. Ran into quite a few issues that sort of ruined MyGM for me. I'll likely stream a lot of MyCareer this year though.
@JosiahRenaudin I think that'll be right there for me as well. Anxious to hear the first information on it.
@vicious696 @godfree Especially when we see a space combat mode in the sequel. ;)
@JosiahRenaudin Destiny, Evolve &amp; NHL 15.
Here's something to help you through your Thursday: 
While you're waiting for the Destiny beta, here's a collection of live Destiny streams you can check out: 
@on3nightstan My ElGato comes back from repair today. Just in time to stream the Destiny beta!
@GoldGloveTV Yup, still getting that. Fingers crossed they're released soon!
@shinobi602 Ha, noticed this morning you've had it for a bit. Share the love, please!
Destiny beta scheduled to go live in a little over an hour &amp; the @Playstation Store is under "maintenance".
@Malik4Play Hit up "WhoIsDo" on PSN if you need an extra tonight on PS4.
@TheCraigEvans Congratulations, Craig! We're making it official next September, so hopefully I have a similar tweet in 15 years!
Made dinner, and all #scumbag @Kathryn_Ryan can say is that I used the wrong cheese. #LifeWithKT
@bpmarkowitz Being able to stream NFL Sunday Ticket on my Xbox One would be a DREAM. If I can use Chromecast too?! *faints*
Looks like a subscription for NFL Sunday ticket is coming to XB1, PS4 &amp; more: 

Full story -  
@JosiahRenaudin Pre-order the game. If not, every person with a beta key gets a total of 3 codes. Ask for one here: 
Here's a link to IGN's Destiny beta stream: 
@TannerVaughn Time to step up my workout!
Man or woman, this is the craziest course run I've seen on American Ninja Warrior. 
@CPaladino Don't blame you. EA SPORTS Golf should drop next Spring, if you can hold out that long.
@Skiffington_ @Nick_Mudry If I actually knew something about it, I probably would. They have a crazy active forum already though.
@CPaladino The Golf Game will arrive on PS4 soon, but I think it's available as early access on PC now.
@on3nightstan Is it a gluten issue, or something else? Please tell me you've had some sort of cookie at some point!
@on3nightstan You can't eat any cookies...? If that's the case, my condolences.

Details - 
Nike continues to kill it w/ their Hyperdunk collection. Can't wait to scoop the '14 version: 


As a rule of thumb, let's not announce pre-order bonuses until we've shown gameplay.. or at least a screenshot.
Tyler Johnson, formerly of Fresno State, was about 3 inches from being on Sportscenter tonight for the Miami Heat. #NBASummerLeague
If you haven't heard of @Hozier yet, I highly recommend checking out his live tracks on NPR: 
@ladyluck34 I'd put my money on vocal minority.
@ladyluck34 To me, Bungie already had the audience with MS. Why not strike a deal with Sony to capture that audience as well?
Assassin's Creed Unity looks great. Loved the high-drop movement &amp; feel of the trailer: 
@owengood No one at Comic-Con will notice.
Will Barton just baptized some poor soul in the NBA Summer League. Wow.
@Steve_OS Just start 4 guards &amp; Josh Smith. #championship
"What if they played Michael Jordan's "This is How We Do It" right now? -  @Kathryn_Ryan #lifewithkt
And now I've just witnessed a selfie with an iPad at this wedding. #oldpeople
@JosiahRenaudin @Kathryn_Ryan #CaughtBaeSleeping
@JosiahRenaudin I only take pictures with @Kathryn_Ryan where we kiss. Non-kissing pictures now seem awkward.
Shoutout to the old people taking pictures of other people with their iPads at this wedding.
If you're excited for @DestinyTheGame, I'd love for you to check out &amp; sign-up on Destiny Overwatch! 
@aaronwatermelon Let me proudly represent America! #cheeseburgers
@aaronwatermelon Replace @ImCAntonio with me since he's dead. I like long walks on the beach &amp; toting assault rifles.
@ladyluck34 Just built a PC recently!

RETWEET for Cavaliers
FAVORITE for Heat 
@4everVersatile LOL, I meant Paul George. My bad man.
@4everVersatile Nope. There's no way the Suns would trade Dragic for George Hill, lol.
@4everVersatile Talks were happening between Suns/Pacers of a Dragic/Granger swap. Thomas to Suns may mean it happens, not sure though.
Isaiah Thomas to the Suns may mean that the Granger/Dragic deal may be happening still.
@hernleyt I think Ariza will get offers from OKC &amp; Miami for more money. Should be interesting!
@hernleyt I like Gortat's deal, because they needed to sign him long-term, but it'll suck in years 4-5.
The Bulls are pursuing Wade in hopes that his good knee mixed w/ Derrick Rose's good knee will create a good basketball player.
@KlayRule Having the Knicks was the worst decision I ever made that night. #Iwantarematch
@NewYorkRic 
@NewYorkRic 
@NewYorkRic Oh, you thought you were getting to play as Cleveland this time? HA... HAHAHA.. HAHAHAHAHA
LeBron in Cleveland also means I finally get revenge on the ridiculous buzzer beater @NewYorkRic beat me with 8 years ago in NBA 2K.
@VernNotice You can't tell me that he isn't the NBA's version of Hulk Hogan, lol.
Now that LeBron is back in Cleveland, I'm really convinced that his time in Miami were his NWO years.
@peterocc Are you on Steam? If so, be sure to add "WhoIsDo"!
I'm a man of my word. Giving away two copies of #NBA2K15 since LeBron announced he's going back to Cleveland: 

#TheReturn 
It's official. "@SI_LeeJenkins: LeBron: "I'm coming home." @SINow exclusive in the words of @KingJames: 
Over the past ten days, two words have dominated the sports world: LeBron &amp; sources.
@JLaudy Less politics, more brownies.
@Lunchbox700 @RareBishop I feel for both of you.
Just your friendly reminder that 7/11 is giving out free small slurpees tomorrow.
@ShayPomeroy Kills me every time. I always laugh at the "Domain Auction" services places advertise. I'll never go that route.
@Kathryn_Ryan Hey Kathy! :)
@ShayPomeroy Worst are the ones who buy domain protection, but don't use a working email to allow you to reach them.
@ShayPomeroy Went to see if someone bought "
@ScottOGallagher Also could let him push to have two numbers retired on the same team, which would be unreal.
@ScottOGallagher Have to think he does a different (third) number. Works for jersey sales &amp; the before/after identity.
@Steve_OS Your tweet is included in this Deadspin article, fyi: 
Wow. LeBron James just declared he's heading to the Los Angeles Lakers on a 2-year deal. 
Expect a LeBron announcement to happen in 3, 2, 1......
@Wario64 @shinobi602 Was able to get Xbox One yesterday for Ghost edition. They stated they're expecting more PS4 soon.
@stephensonmc If it's an amateur coder, it's also possible that code was left there from 2010.
Why are conference calls always filled with people who don't know how to use the mute button?
@Daniel0061824 @AminESPN Mike's jerseys are all over the wall, including what looks like a Montana. An LBJ Cleveland is right beside him.
@AminESPN If you haven't seen it, Mike Miller just teased that LeBron is heading to Cleveland: 
Welp, looks like Mike Miller is confirming that LeBron is going back to Cleveland! 

View - 
@peterocc I'm not sold on that image though. Could be another hoax.
So Melo is reportedly staying in New York &amp; there are moving trucks in front of LeBron's Miami home? 
@israeljcruz If he doesn't go to Cleveland, Twitter will be unreal for at least a week. #Icantwait
@SirPsychoT @GoodGameBro Read the replies to my initial tweet. It's all listed there.
Congrats everyone, you reached the 50 RT mark for the #NBA2K15 contest. Once LeBron chooses, the contest will go live on @GoodGameBro!
@Joshinator711 @GoodGameBro Three copies if it's a team other than Heat/Cavs.
@NickTheBullsFan @GoodGameBro LeBron to the Knicks, Bulls, or Clippers is 3 copies.
@Donski3 Deal!
At 50 RTs, I'll do a contest on @GoodGameBro. LeBron to Miami is 1 copy of #NBA2K15. LeBron to Cleveland is 2 copies of #NBA2K15.
@stephensonmc @vicious696 Not to mention, Wade is also sitting in on that meeting (reportedly). Just question his ability to say "no" there.
@vicious696 I agree that he should head to Cleveland, but I question his ability to leave Wade and Riley.
@ZAN_4PM Easily in my top five favorite scenes of anything. Remember watching the episode as a kid &amp; tearing up a little, lol.
In all honesty though, I'd be pretty surprised if LeBron leaves Miami. Pat Riley is a great deal closer &amp; not sure LeBron is that ballsy.
@Just_Tank Because I don't follow him, haha. Saw it on my timeline, and figured everyone else had as well.
Regarding my Cavs tweet, here's where it's coming from: 
Cavs are pursuing Ray Allen as well? Your move now, Pat Riley.
If LeBron doesn't go to Cleveland, here's how every Cleveland fan will feel: 
@sustakoski No more than 5 days a year to have a "bad day". When you have one, write it down. Look them over at the end of the year &amp; grow.
Has a World Cup team ever won by double digits? #GER #BRA
@AminESPN Expecting a plethora of #HateHard tweets from you shortly.
This is what it looks like when I try to play @EASPORTSFIFA online against someone else. #BRA getting destroyed!
GG, #BRA.
So, Klose just made this one interesting game. No way would I have imagined Brazil being down by 2 goals this year.
@TooMuchHamza I can't confirm that... but I can say that pants are, well, optional.
Something that never stops being funny to me is seeing a groom wearing jeans during the wedding.
@ImCAntonio Neither does @DuvalMagic lol.
Expecting Game Informer to unveil Cliff Bleszinski's new game for their cover reveal in 48 minutes.
Happy birthday to @godfree! Appreciate your help &amp; support over the years!
@RapSheet It's the LeBron factor. Melo may cause a few dominoes, but LeBron's signing will create a flurry of moves.
@jond4v Definitely agree with you here. Granger will likely have a few solid games, but still not worth $4 million for the Heat's needs.
ICYMI: Here's the @DestinyTheGame beta release dates - 
@4everVersatile Because he wasn't quite what they thought he'd be when they picked him up.
Danny Granger to the Heat is pretty terrible, even at $4 million. Did absolutely nothing the last season or two since his injury.
Now that the @DestinyTheGame collector's editions have been announced, are you planning to upgrade? 
@VernNotice Definitely. I can't wait to make a montage around plasma grenade tricks. Also, add me on Skype &amp; Steam!
@VernNotice It is. The same glitches are even in the remake.
@godfree Ha, yeah, that's why I deleted the tweet :). Depending on what time it ends on 27th, Xbox has 4-5 days.
@crecenteb Father of the Year!
@DevinKofsky 5 days of the Destiny beta.
