@AmyDentata BUT WHY DID THEY DO THOSE PROSTHETICS ON JGL'S FACE
me: " survival is hopeless:
*sees  something pleasant* " :) this is v nice I like it"
*pleasant  thing is over*
"I hate myself I wanna die"
@ComradeKalinka ppl who don't understand that p much ALL media is problematic in some way frustrate me. Your fave thing is problematic. deal
@Mismembered @BootlegGirl @GoodTransPosts I guess the trans part worked out okay but everything else I'm still dealing with and it sucks
@BootlegGirl @Mismembered @GoodTransPosts I did it within my first year and fucked up the rest of my life in the process
@ThatSabineGirl @prttypinkposies Yeah, exactly. It sucks, but we can't NOT do it. It's what makes us who we are
@prttypinkposies @ThatSabineGirl I can't imagine going back, and if 'd put it off I would've wound up eventually transitioning anyway
@prttypinkposies @ThatSabineGirl Like I still see a guy in the mirror anyways so what's the fucking point.... but at the same time like...
@prttypinkposies @ThatSabineGirl and the dysphoria is just as bad as ever
@prttypinkposies @ThatSabineGirl Sometimes I wish I'd just accepted myself as a femme presenting boy instead, as a compromise, cuz it hurts
@prttypinkposies @ThatSabineGirl Transition has left me in financial ruin, stranded in a city with no family or safety net.
@BootlegGirl n

n-no

no not really
@vivian_games voice chat has never made a single fucking thing better
@ThatSabineGirl but SOMEONE has to stand up for those oppressed affluent folks
@ThatSabineGirl sublingual? yeah idk I thought the same thing
@PrincessPinkie late 90s video game magazine ads

all of them
@ThatSabineGirl If it helps I'm in a similar boat right now and I really feel you
@OhMiaGod It's a money issue, I have enough medical bills I can't pay as it is, and I can barely pay for hormones
congratulations, you are a fundamentally better person than me witha  far stronger sense of  responsibility and work ethic, i am shit
nob ody at work will care, i'll just  get stories like "well i worked with  severe back pain" like...cool
JUST MAKE IT FUCKING STOP BEFORE I LOSE EVERYTHING TO IT
someone just  take me away from this, please, i  can't take it
i am not crying for help i am screaming for it and there ain't shit anyone can do
my depression is get ting as bad as it was when i got fired
@TheTenumi I find this is a problem with a lot of 'fandom' communities
can't afford therapy, can't motivate myself to get a better job, no car, no money, wanting to die...  how do i fix this
going on protected because I hate myself with an intense passion
@ThatSabineGirl @destroyed4com4t "auto-gynephiliacs"
@fleetfootedfox Ij ust keep thinking that I  can't do  this anymore

I don't know what to do but I can't
Abilene was a worse place, certainly, but I had stability there and a safety net
sometimes I wonder if moving to San Antonio was the worst decision i've evermade
@ramonasewage but what about the hammond b3?
@ImprobableJoe I appreciate  it all, thank you
@ImprobableJoe if I'm depressed, my partner definitely is too, and she also deals with PTSD and a host of other things

this causes issues
@ImprobableJoe and the worst moments come with a kind of suicidal ideation. I don't want to actively kill myself, but I wouldn't mind dying
@ImprobableJoe so it's normal for it to be quiet sometimes and feel like it's screaming in your face other times and everywhere in between?
@ImprobableJoe and frankly I took that to mean that there wasn't really anything wrong with me, I was just a sad sack of shit
@ImprobableJoe when I lost my last job someone I know criticized me about it, "you're supposed to FIGHT the depression, not wallow in it"
@ImprobableJoe i'm supposed to be learning linux. can't motivate myself, i'm supposed to look into other jobs, nurp. the house is SO messy..
@ImprobableJoe I just.. couldn't. Like I couldn't make myself leave the house, I just froze there and the longer I froze the heavier it felt
@ImprobableJoe like today, I was suppose d to go to work, right before work I felt just... not up to walking that 2 miles or so, and then...
@ImprobableJoe yeah... the longer I put something off, the worse I feel for having put it off, and the more I feel like I just... can't
@ImprobableJoe and no matter what I do I can't seem to get motivated to tackle anything genuinely important
@ImprobableJoe .I am also consumed with self loathing though, the things that help feel fleeting because I always go back to the self hate
@ImprobableJoe can I be depressed? I'm happy sometimes, I can enjoy things, it 's not a constant, never ending mountain of apathetic hell
my  ho use is a wr eck, I blow off my job, I can't even pay my own bills without begging for help that I KNOW I don't deserve
Iwish I knew what  was wrong with me  and why I seem to avoid even the most basic responsibilities

am i just lazy and irresponsible?
@OhMiaGod  not the same as being in person, but I'm always willing to voice chat sometime if you'd like
@OhMiaGod support groups can be hit and miss b ut it might be worth going
I really miss having a car, walking to work every day is horrible

shit i'd be happy with a bike if I could even afford that
god i am loving splatoon
i acidentally got a tan from walking to work

this fucking su cks

how am i supposed to be goth now?
@hikikomerri fact the the chars you can relate to are almost always portrayed as villains speaks more to institutional ableism than anything
@FlemishDog @burgeroise evidently not!
@caephyn anything that points to a singular socially disadvantaged enttity and claims it's the SOURCE OF ALL EVIL is p suspect to me
@destroyed4com4t could you imagine though how much better off we'd be if there was actually a global conspiracy orchestrated in our favor?
@destroyed4com4t "There is no homosexual agenda there is a heterosexual agenda and its been active for the last thousands of years."

ya  !!
just sayihg this right now, nobody bite my boobs please

not into that
@SchalaAsha @emitans I approve of pantsless men
@emitans @SchalaAsha I think that's supposed to be a very spoony bard
FWIW, I don't need anything fancy with video editing. Just ability to sync up audio , maybe do color adjustments, and title cards, etc
@asterisxos it's a good suggestion though!
@asterisxos I'm desperately trying to avoid having to pirate expensive software lol
hey what is good for video editing software?

is there a Reaper of the video world?
@awhooker @ThatSabineGirl they really suck at the "therefore discrimination, judgement, hatred, etc is justified" part
@KelestiMMO APPARENTLY :O
I've been told by multiple people that i'm exactly the same IRL as I am online

not sure what to make of that
any of  my followers interested in a video of me nerding out about kirby music?

y'all can DM...
I want to do a vlog and idk what about
holy shit four thousand tweets
@JasonPKaplan @NireBryce because a lot of people who'd most benefit have been convinced that it's bad and would somehow hurt them
@ComradeNova I've demo'd songs at like 2am and nobody has ever complained

i'm loud as fuck too

probably a bad idea anyways
@NireBryce and a gift card to sockdreams
@NireBryce @Jennimason0990 I'm not into witchcraft but I am into metal and am fond of like, pentagrams and magic circles and shit as imagery
@NireBryce @mcclure111 ah the days of casually browsing m4t

(I'm kidding, I only did that once, it scared me)
@psdevin I'd  totally be up for abolishing DST (it was always an aggravating thing to deal with working nights anyways) but...Texas Time?
@sophiaphotos Ugh, so sorry to hear that, Losing a beloved pet is never easy, and misgendering fucktrumpets don't help My condolences.
@ametur_poet BUT THAT'S JUST CAPITALISM! SUPPLY AND DEMAND! U CAN'T COMPLAIN!

yeah and capitalism is horsecock too, ur point?
@ametur_poet the 'collector' scene is such horsecock
@leahvelcro I got someone calling me 'ugly' as a retort against something I said

i also consider this a milestone
@BootlegGirl @DataSnake gamer geek dudes are rarely hot, why would you pretend to be anything to court them?
@SloaneRisette @BootlegGirl I pretended to be eww dick but I totally would've sucked one given the chance becuase I loved dick tbqh
Y'all (we're takin it back)
Team
Folx
Lovelies (if you're familiar w yr audience)
Party …
@legobutts gentlefolk is lovely and i already use 'folk' a lot
@sophiaphotos @ArchetypeBlue "no platformed"
@Warlord_Warrior o no u called me ugly wat am i gonna do D:
@KiwiNull @destroyed4com4t "My senses were battered by it [...] it physically hurt me" sounds like amazing praise for a noise project to me
@quartzdyke i always thought 'bourgeois' sounded like a dog breed anyways
@musicallyalice @actuallyalice  lets bring it back like they did vinyl
I really strongly dislike the word "tits" i'm just sayin right now
@ShayBlez @sophiaphotos @TransEthics considering that payout is more than SRS would cost I imagine if it was legit we'd have heard it before
@ShayBlez @sophiaphotos @TransEthics i doubt they want our balls they're too T starved and shrunk and probably sterile

still it'd be nice
@awhooker @electricalwell I remember some near identical bullshit stories circulating when "Die Cis Scum" was a thing
friend: "I might have gender feeils" 

me: *crashes and stumbles over things* "REALLY NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THAT"
I hate Exodus

*listens to Exodus*
@GuyInYourMFA guys never have good taste in metal
@ZJemptv eep, yeah... that's gonna have to hold off a while then. No insurance and all :X
@ThatSabineGirl *blasts Limp Wrist and Homomilitia*
@ThatSabineGirl i've heard some right wing hardcore, RAC stuff, NSBM...

it all sucks

not to mention fucking disgusting in every way
@ZJemptv I just hit my 9month mark, hrmm.... 

is it particularly pricey? I can barely afford spiro+E right now
@ZJemptv how long were you on HRT before you got on P?

thinking about it myself, next doc appt will be at my 1yr mark
@destroyed4com4t  they

they really have no idea what noise is
someone told me the fashion style i'm shooting for is basically scene queen and I feel somewhat insulted?????????
@ShayBlez oh and this site: 

see  what's out there locally for you
@ShayBlez that's assume we'r ejust talking about filling prescriptions as opposed to doc appointments
@ShayBlez I have no insurance, that's what I have to do. On 200mg spiro/10mg E per day and that comes out to around $35ish a month
@ShayBlez jsyk walmart's cheap generics include estradiol and spiro. It won't be $4 at our dosages but it's still affordable
@sophiaphotos IIRC all he was saying was that beards have some of the same bacteria that help break down food in digestion
@sophiaphotos apparently, as  is usually the case with stuff like this, those articles are based on a misquote by a microbiologist

Being called "cis" is not a slur.

Being called "cis" is not a slur.

Being called "c…
@NireBryce I can personally vouch for this
@quartzdyke ugh if i wasn't dealing with my own shit i'd be happy to help
@actuallyalice If they're openly declaring they are a feminist that's a pretty easy way to spot one

somoehow i doubt thats what the HT says
@ThatSabineGirl @ZJemptv "forced to wear high heels and stupid dresses"
@leftytgirl is it worth even bothering to highlight how fucking absurd their premise is? probably not...
I hate myself so much right now and I already regret that stupid link
I feel like crap making this but we're pretty desperate at this point. Click to Donate:  
I can setup a gofundme now but i'm kinda convinced that posting it up would make me a bad person and that I don't deserve any help
also feeling like it's not okay to vent about feelings or fears or worries because I think people don't care or find it very annoying
has anyone here ever been homeless w/out a car 'cause I'm not sure what to do if that happens
realizing that if I wasn't dealing with a constant crushing weight of stress I might actually be able to be a decent partner
@ComradeKalinka "Deny sex"
@ComradeKalinka something something standing at the next urinal without leaving a space something
@ComradeKalinka omg yes
@ThatSabineGirl   it's actually got a weird cult following believe it or not
@sexcellentciel every single otherkin i've ever known was trans so...
@sexcellentciel yes good ty


dis is about my music!!

this is so cool
I still can't seem to speak very easily and i'm having shakes
to uncontrollable endless sobbing and slobbering and saying "I can't do it" over and over..I tried but couldn't say anything else
summary of  panic attack: starting having difficulty breathing and clenching hard, to shaking, and barely being able to breathe at all &gt;&gt;
@IAmAboutUs hugs are good, i'm still a bit shaky
I just had the worst panic attack i've ever had how are you
so if I can somehow scrape together enough $$$ to pay rent, then we won't have any $$$ for food

how do we solve this issue
@leahvelcro i have apparently gotten 'stuck' in this mode help


'cause it demands evidence
somehow my voice has adopted this straight up valley girl inflection and i find this strange and worrying and hilarious
I'm sorry I hope that wasn't triggering for anyone
"I can't ever be a REAL girl so I should stop pretending" 

weird thoughts in the back of my head sometimes
that right there might just be internalized transphobia though
I've even though of like (gulp) detransition... but I can't see myself stopping HRT or anything and I like my chosen name and 'she' pronouns
i'm increasingly interested in 'playing' masculinity, like... idk drag king stuff, etc
it's a hard to describe and pin down feeling i guess

idk... nonbinary feelings? *shrug*
so the more comfortable and cofident i become in my womanhood, the more I've also noticed how i'm coming to terms with my masculinity
@Kelly_hengels I mean some are definitely better than others but they're all very watchable and fun in their own ways
@Kelly_hengels MCU is remarkably consistent quality wise all things considered. Like 11 movies in and there aren't any spidey 3 type wrecks
@ireneista ....because any attempt my friend makes at asserting herself is going to be met with guilt tripping about being so awful etc etc
@ireneista my friend's mom is manipulative and deadnames and blackmails her a lot, and is ultra unsupportive. I dread the holiday for her.
@ireneista my relationship with my mom is fine I suppose, but i'm still unnerved by those tweets
@ireneista I think I know who you're talking about and yeah... I agree with you
da fuck is up with all these fake twitters of pretty girls spewing out endless 'inspirational' love quotes
@mizabitha you could make :| with a vulva too

anyways my dong fills me with sadness and frustration so i will not make faces on it
@aesmael @ami_angelwings like the DCAU stuff nad MCU stuff work fine, when you have to do multiple universe reboots you should rethink stuff
@aesmael @ami_angelwings continuity works in more limited contexts, but not in several decades and a billion comic runs
@meowrobot DM, maybe?
@meowrobot oy I can't say i've followed closely, but that can also refer to a ton of things...
@meowrobot I think I missed something here 'cause i'm lost
@ThatSabineGirl kinda ridiculous that those things need to be said really
if ur gonna spank me make sure i can feel the sting otherwise why
@Wolferfly I just feel like it'd probably hit way too close to home
@Wolferfly   I have intentionally avoided that series because I don't want to be ridiculous depressed
@quartzdyke @NireBryce  i'd probably use it if I wasn't worried i'd get crap for it
@quartzdyke @NireBryce to be fair I always saw it as an 'opt in' personal identifier
@quartzdyke @NireBryce they just say 'it's dumb' and 'goofy' and 'you can't just reclaim a slur that hasn't been used in 400+ years'
@quartzdyke @NireBryce where'd that colon come from? sheesh my keyboard needs replacing
@quartzdyke @NireBryce a lot of my irl friends really hate the term:Baeddel and that makes me sad because tbqh i love it
@quartzdyke  post HRT orgasms are so intense that they're hard to handle and I end up wanting them less 'cause I CAN'T HANDLE IT
@quartzdyke @NireBryce true story i have a friend who can suck her own dick

she says its hard to enjoy it when you're bent like that
@zip oyyyyyyyyy yes
@ComradeKalinka she basically says to learn bash, networking stuff (SSH, DNS, etc), and may  be some scripting stuff
@ComradeKalinka I've got a friend who's done that work before who's kinda giving me a primer on what I need, but i'm feeling overwhelmed
@ComradeKalinka qualifications on the site seem to simply be "do u linux?? can u computer?? customer service?????"
SO much pressure, I'm terrified i'm just going to fuck it all up, or i'll get the job and just quickly get fired, idk...
it's basically my only hope for a survivable income, 'learn linux and get this job or be homeless' is basically what i'm looking at  now
right now my current job doesn't pay enough, literally, I can't pay my bills on it, there's a nearby place I would work as a linux admin at
I mean I can learn, I pick up these sorts of skills quick, i've learned to code an NES before, I'm sure I can handle it

but it's also like
i wanna get a job as a linux admin but i don't actually know linux super well

nor do I know anything else

i just like solving problems
@zip which one is that?
@BootlegGirl the wild thing about San Antonio is how un-texas it is while still feeling so very very texas
@destroyed4com4t @isentil (between you and me I still suspect she has some nb feels or something)
@destroyed4com4t @isentil I legit thought that manager was a trans guy at first because she presents very androgynously
@destroyed4com4t @isentil my boss is a cis woman named "Adrian" for crying out loud

names don't mean shit
@destroyed4com4t @isentil shit my deadname is all over the scheudle at my current job and most people still don't know i'm trans lol
@AikoChanIsAwsum 
@AikoChanIsAwsum LIKE THE CARS FROM DAYTONA USA

YOU CAN PLAY AS THEM IN A FIGHTING GAME
@ChloeSagal do you want hugs?
@AikoChanIsAwsum srsly that system has some of the most bizarre games Sega's ever put out

YOU CAN PLAY AS CARS IN FIGHTERS MEGAMIX OKAY?
@AikoChanIsAwsum ppl don't talk much about the WEIRD shit. NiGHTs is seriously weird. D is weird. Enemy Zero is unplayably weird.
@AikoChanIsAwsum they all have strengths: N64 - party games and multiplayer, PS1 - JRPGs, Saturn - weird experimental shit + arcade ports
@AikoChanIsAwsum  someone really loves Pokemon Snap and Snowboard Kids
*sings along to judas priest songs*
I think my clean singing technique has gotten a lot better but i'm still not willing to show it off publically
@destroyed4com4t o noes do you think people will find out that you're trans????
@A1B24C15D13E35 i only like metal because of how gay it is lol
@A1B24C15D13E35 I'm not even sure why the guy thought I was a nihilist in the first place.....
@A1B24C15D13E35 this reminds me of the time I got into an argument with someone who insisted I wasn't a "true nihilist" and I was like wha??
@A1B24C15D13E35 I was gonna attempt but i'm groggy and no warm up and my technique sounds AWFUL right now ahahah
@A1B24C15D13E35 one day I need to figure out what my vocal range is. I don't do a lot of clean singing but I enjoy it and want to do more
@quartzdyke &lt;3 yeah, i've known folks like that myself

just something to work out for myself really
@quartzdyke and I feel like there's pressure in the sense that people interpret the former to cancel out the latter
@quartzdyke yeah,  like... seriously

I don't think I'd ever be comfy with pronouns other than "she"...  but I think about nb stuff a bunch
@quartzdyke  ....femme tomboy? "tomboy leaning"? 

stop me before I put my foot in my mouth :P
@quartzdyke 'course on the other hand i consider myself a tomboy and i too have some nb feels here and there
@quartzdyke  fwiw I find transdar doesn't really work very well in general, binary identifying or otherwise
@quartzdyke  ahhh, yeah I didn't think you were I was just trying to get clarification
@quartzdyke are you suggesting that all cis tomboys are trans guys?
@hellakyra @quartzdyke I WANT TO FOLLOW THIS BOT
@bunydoll fuuuufufufufuuuccckkkkk yes plese
I'll have these big convos and then i immediately my brain j umps into LOL WHAT IS GOING ON HERE mode and idk why lol
@quartzdyke ah I remember the days of really strongly wishing I were trans and getting really sad at the thought that I might not be
@quartzdyke I.... know exactly that feel
@BootlegGirl idk i don't think anyone's mad at you or anything, I know i'm not
@quartzdyke @BootlegGirl @ComradeKalinka like cops can help in some specific situations and some contexts but they def aren't our friends
@quartzdyke @BootlegGirl @ComradeKalinka  I think it's a pretty good metaphor really, it works  on a lot of levels
@BootlegGirl like i'm terrified of being arrested, I can't even handle heated arguments without severe stess

she's cool about it though
@BootlegGirl i've got an awesome friend who's v radical and has been arrested a lot doing trans activism. I'm a weenie tho i don't accompany
@quartzdyke @BootlegGirl aww I love both of ya
@quartzdyke @BootlegGirl @ComradeKalinka to be fair i don't see dems doing stuff like bathroom bills, but I still don't trust them
@BootlegGirl @quartzdyke I really don't think it does, it's faux radicalism merely dressing up a defense of status quo
@BootlegGirl @quartzdyke @ComradeKalinka much of that due to pressure from us, not handed by them freely
@BootlegGirl @quartzdyke @ComradeKalinka it's an understandable fear but the point is that the dems are at best occasional frenemies
@BootlegGirl @quartzdyke @ComradeKalinka hang with more trans radicals they're cool people
@quartzdyke we (binary trans) were thrown under the bus for years because we'd be inconvenient to gay rights

now its the same w/ nb people
@BootlegGirl @ComradeKalinka those are good yes, but the same state is willing to throw us under the bus the second we're 'inconvenient'
@quartzdyke here in SATX it was a democrat who tried to exclude trans protections from the local NDO

so you know... yeah...
@quartzdyke @BootlegGirl @ComradeKalinka those ppl aren't radical, they're more like.... noodles
@quartzdyke I feel like I've ran into very few if any gatekeepers at all, but that's also just my own experience

oyy
@emitans  a lot of it is really catchy, energetic, super upbeat, and really positive and bubbly

so yeah I absolutely love it
@emitans kirby music is best music
@BootlegGirl @IAmAboutUs *mega poor hi five*
@BootlegGirl @IAmAboutUs  some room in my schedule I mean, not for you to stay at my apartment

(though I guess if you wanted....)
@BootlegGirl @IAmAboutUs !! cool!, just lemme know when, i'll see if I can make some room

(i'm also ultra broke just fyi)
@vivian_games she's been sketchy about sex worker stuff for a long time and she's never answered q's about it. .
@BootlegGirl @IAmAboutUs That'd be fun if you're cool with coming to San Antonio... (I don't have a car anymore)
I AM BACK HOME NOW AND MY FEET ARE FUCKING SCREAMING I CAN BARELY MOVE THIS IS SO GODDAMN PAINFUL AAAAAAA

BREAKING IN BOOTS IS HARDCORE
'bout to walk 2 miles in fucking new boots that haven't been broken in yet wish me luck
nobody cares about boxing and then suddenly everyone cared about boxing for a second i don't even ??????
@BootlegGirl @IAmAboutUs noooo but if you leave TX we'll no longer share a state and thus our chance of IRL hanging out is diminished!!! D:
@ThatSabineGirl I'll seriously miss you if you do leave. You're wonderful.
LRT I love this sort of thing so much
@ThatSabineGirl  As a US resident, of Texas even,... the US is fucking WEIRD
@AikoChanIsAwsum  so keep ur dick, go be trans, be awesome, enjoy life, love lots, etc etc  

&lt;3
@AikoChanIsAwsum afaik the way they're used these days they're pretty much interchangeable, 'transsexual' is just more outdated
@AikoChanIsAwsum actually p sure i know more trans people who *don't* want bottom surgery than I do ones who do
@AikoChanIsAwsum since when does being trans have  anything to do with your dick anyways
@emitans well then you can't be trans im sorry
@emitans eh if you can perform you can make it work

don't give up on ur dreams!!
didn't like doing the selfie avvy on here
@emitans you can change both of those things!!!
what the fuck even *is* instagram
trying out this 'selfie avatar' thing some folks do
@ThatSabineGirl idk people like Frank Miller's Batman too so...
@ireneista @zip IDK WHEN OR HOW BUT ONE DAY I TOO WILL KNOW THE DISCOMFORT OF DILATION
@zip *takes note*
@ThatSabineGirl truth
@ThatSabineGirl what the fuck kind of shit anarchists don't believe in racism???

Lemme guess... they're white, came from wealthy families
@sophiaphotos I bruise more easily, something to do with skin changes I think
@quartzdyke my fave thing about anti-facial recognition facepaint is that everyone looks like they just walked out of an 80s cyberpunk film
hey merri found my ankh cool

also I want more tops like this one 
@BootlegGirl I'd criticize but I've had a similar feeling with Devin Townsend so lol
@ChloeSagal something about obsessively stalking people on twitter for no reason and telling them they need 'psychiatric help' feels ...off
breaking in your shoes is the worst thing
I fucked up everything and I hate myself

I don't know what to do oand if i get help i'll probably fuck THAT up too
@destroyed4com4t Yeah these guys don't even have the "I gotta eat/pay my bills" excuse
@destroyed4com4t @Hannibal1310 @lilserana88 @ThatSabineGirl Do they realize that they aren't required to support things they don't like?
@destroyed4com4t @Hannibal1310 @lilserana88 @ThatSabineGirl "I stalk people 'cause ppl give them money for things i don't like."
@destroyed4com4t I'm thinking this mentality is how people justify the existence of gossip rags.
@destroyed4com4t @Hannibal1310 @lilserana88 @ThatSabineGirl  What's even the point of this creepy bullshit? The fuck is their problem?
@BootlegGirl aheheheheh I totally don't do that ever nope &gt;.&gt;
@krainboltgreene @destroyed4com4t I could never imagine actually attacking someone else for taking a different route, like... why?
@krainboltgreene @destroyed4com4t *everything* I've ever done (music mostly, but i've tried gamedev and art) was learned on my own
@krainboltgreene @destroyed4com4t maybe if he focused on actually making his shit instead of obsessing over 'rivals' he might get somewhere!
@destroyed4com4t THIS GAME DEV WHO DOES DIFFERENT THINGS AND HAS DIFFERENT GOALS DOESNT DO WHAT I DO AND THIS BOTHERS ME - all I read
@destroyed4com4t even if he had one and Chloe didn't, I like.... don't understand why he should care?

I legit don't understand
@destroyed4com4t   I like that these fucks think anyone should give a shit about their unsolicited professional advice
oh nice... I forgot my HRT dose this morning

yup... fuck up
I just don't know how to fix it and more importantly I don't nkow how to fix ME so that it doesn't just keep happening
like each months its is like "this time am I going to wind up actually homeless" and tbqh I know its all my fault
@aliendovecote lmao
One day everyone who's helped me in the past is going to either give up or no longer have the means and every month it gets closer
hey kids its the time of the month where I begin my regularly scheduled descent into self loathing, who wants to join the ride
I really hate myself and don't understand why i'm so irreparably inept
lol how the fuck do Imanage to not have enough  money for rent every month

i know why

becuase i suck and blew our extra $$$ on fast food
@aliendovecote I.... wat
fuck video games

just saying
@DrPalutena @emitans @mistydemeo yeah texas gets cold, it snowed regularly back in Abilene and that's not much farther north than SATX / HTX
this is probably how I blow through my budget all the time
i'm hungry and tired and kinda sad, today would be a good day for pizza if we weren't broke

blargl
@BootlegGirl she deals with intense PTSD among other things and I deal with financial stress and dysphoria and everything else \o/
@BootlegGirl me and my girlfriend are both often depressed so our house has been clean maybe 3 times in the 7 or so months we've lived here
@quartzdyke Shitfucks...

:(
@quartzdyke I take it you're on about the highest dose of spiro you can manage too....

GnRH Agonists not an option either? Probably not...
@quartzdyke you're still virilizing on that much? o_O

sounds like it's time for an orchi

(assuming you don't want the virilization ofc)
@quartzdyke how highi?

they have my ass on 10mg E per day :X
@duckinator Wow p much every band listed there is all around awful
taht how old site put me at like 14-16 years old on a lot of my pics

I feel weird about that

was gendered properly in all of them tho
@ChloeSagal happy to help depending on what it is
@ChloeSagal hrm?
@leahvelcro i fuckin wish i had family wealth ;_;
my tumblr is here is my followers here want:

uhm.... idk when this happened but uhhh

wow i'm actually kinda hot
@ZJemptv @leahvelcro Dallas is the closest place that'd have options that I'm aware of. Might be better off looking in New Mexico or so
The lineup isn't even that fucking good this year anyways show some goddamn respsect

The protests are bigger than your shit.
apparently folks at MDF are 'complaining' that the Baltimore protests are running their metal festival

uhm how about fuck you kindly?
my music got picked up by some internet radio thing that nobody listens to

i'm flattered
@delafro_ @thetrudz they're just jealous 'cause the het lifestyle is the most boring lifestyle
@BootlegGirl   No More Heroes?
@NireBryce glad you said this 'cause i've felt that way a long time
@actuallyalice EVERY FUCKING TIME ALWAYS

Getting baked af 

"Cool" 
@fleetfootedfox @SchellAgain "IRAVF" is my new band name
@A1B24C15D13E35 waltz in with your most blatantly queer attire and just be like "so I heard this was the GSA"
@Aknorals @JFMTheThird @destroyed4com4t it's almost like he knows he's full of shit and just says 'controversial' dumb shit for fame/clicks
@lisasevern   the transgender was me all along
@lisasevern "REAL TRANSGENDER!!" like holy shit you mean they're REAL!?
@destroyed4com4t  STAGES OF GENDER DYSMOR- ERM DYSPHORIA IN 'MALES'

STAGE 1: NOT LIKING FOOTBALL
...
@destroyed4com4t I'm sure the logic amounts to "I don't understand the first thing about either so i'm going to just pretend they're linked"
@destroyed4com4t wondering if he considers *any* form of 'gender nonconformity' to be a form of this 'illness'

has he thought this through?
@destroyed4com4t also I see he stopped saying "Gender Dysmorphia" I wonder why
@destroyed4com4t strange how there are trans people with schizophrenia and how treating it didn't affect their dysphoria isn't it?
I haven't been so excited since I came out
so my little solo music project is going to be an actual 3 piece band now and we're going to get to play live*

*assuming nothing goes wrong
@sophiaphotos  oh my god
@jephjacques the actual mixing process is a lot of fun and rewarding though :C
@kadybat @christinelove I uhm... I am way into this

excuse me....

&gt;.&gt;
@michaelwhitney @OhPoorPup lmao I remember this shit

they got more and more strict and pissy as time went on too
any time I run into another trans woman I get super giddy and excited and want to be best friends
@destroyed4com4t @gokunaruto65 shit I just noticed that it's 800 x 600 resultion, that's like.. HD... !!
@aliendovecote 4:30am and same deal here

fucking raining HARD in San Antonio :X
@destroyed4com4t @gokunaruto65 I could use a pizza key
@ThatSabineGirl but who's going to protect EA?
@destroyed4com4t I will never understand what  motivates fuckers like him or the people who like him
@AnathemaJane @destroyed4com4t @ThatSabineGirl there's something poetic/ironic in the use of the term "mask"
@ThatSabineGirl @AnathemaJane @destroyed4com4t stealing "Suffer the Condition" as a song title btw
@AnathemaJane @ThatSabineGirl @destroyed4com4t will fixing my 'brain problem' make me  suddenly want to present traditionally masculine?
@AnathemaJane @ThatSabineGirl @destroyed4com4t I wonder what he thinks 'cured' (by his definition) trans people would be like.
@destroyed4com4t oh fuck he literally outright called it 'dysmorphia' 

he legit thinks its just about hacking our genitals off
@bunydoll my vulva will consume you whole
@destroyed4com4t I love the wording of those tweets. Like I'm sure he TOTALLY genuinely cares about what's 'cruel' to us. Totally.
@NireBryce @ZJemptv d on't remember the exact quote off the top of my head but yeah, I think about that one a lot
@NireBryce @ZJemptv "they think we'll be shocked by murder stats, but the truth is that some of us wish they were ALL dead" - paraphrased
So i'm thinking about hair chalk. I want funky pastel colors in my hair but my work won't like it being dyed + I'll want to change it a lot
@griffinmcelroy @OhPoorPup "mega creampie"
@griffinmcelroy @OhPoorPup some of these seem like they'd make wonderful song titles/band names
@Hansoff88 @ChelseaPoe666 yo chill dude
@OhPoorPup on the plus side... laserdisc is pretty neato

i'm tempted to just encourage you to nab it but i'm a bad person for $$$ advice
@ami_angelwings @Mornacale @Cirrhosis best roger rabbit sequel
@KelestiMMO I... gah

I don't think I ever even saw that ep, I legit don't remember it

probably for the better...
@OhPoorPup I once almost spent $75 on a copy of Sigh's Imaginary Sonicscape on vinyl.

I know your feels.
@OhPoorPup can you afford it at all?
@KelestiMMO I.... I don't even REMEMBER that episode

I thought it was a cool show but I never understood the cult status
@ChelseaPoe666 homiphobic
@OhPoorPup @mechapoetic im very glad that music doesn't tend to have a comments section
@KariDru @ZJemptv this happened  to me
@ZJemptv is this better or worse than the south park bathroom episode?
@GivMeUrIndieLit  oh god do I even want to know?
@Jennimason0990 @ZJemptv I occasionally have dissociation feelings about my past, pre-out/pre-transition self and they're pretty alarming
@mechapoetic @DrPalutena Those look like some ones I saw on Sockdreams
@BootlegGirl people need to seriously stop comparing gender dysphoria to body dysmorphia. Being trans isn't about cutting off your junk.
@BootlegGirl Because framing being trans as a 'brain problem' fundamentally misunderstands everything about being trans.
@BootlegGirl besides, we already TRIED the whole 'therapy instead of transition' thing, it doesn't work. Never has. 

&gt;&gt;
@BootlegGirl I doubt that, medical consensus is clearly veering in the opposite direction.

Besides, they clearly don't know what trans *IS*
@TransAtheistPod @ZJemptv I thought HRT and shit was a 'crossdresser' thing for a while lol

didn't really understand the whole trans thing
@ZJemptv I thought I had it bad hiding it since I was 12, fuck me
@ZJemptv I love the simultaneous 'we're so progressive for covering this' back patting while ticking every exploitation trope in the book
@AmyDentata I work at a walgreens I can confirm
@sophiaphotos i'm more pissed at tabloid and celeb rags than jenner tbh
@sophiaphotos if I see one more shitty tabloid or gossip mag about Jenner it'll be too fucking soon
@OhPoorPup does blackened crust punk fall more towards the Smooth Jazz side of things or the IDM side?
oh my god it is 80F and 74% humidity today and I have to WALK 2 MILES TO WORK I am going to fucking die
@GivMeUrIndieLit Yeah but then who's going to be "subverting" those whiny politically correct types? A NECESSARY CRITIQUE
@rdouglasjohnson @caitstuff was confused at the rhyme  for the last line but then I remember that everywhere but America says "Zed"
The word "tits" makes me feel icky and sounds particularly vulgar to me. I don't like it.
@actuallyalice  quick google shows it's a common thing to do, acoustic amps are sometimes just used for monitoring.
@actuallyalice bass is often just plugged straight into the PA , so i'd imagine electro-acoustic would be fine.
@actuallyalice I see ppl in "SJW" spheres who seem more like 'reformed' trolls. Ppl just looking to feel 'justified' in cont. past behavior
@refocusedmedia @ami_angelwings EXODYS huh? EVERYBODY'S DOIN THE TOXYK WALTZ
@AmyDentata  a LOT of "intellectual" transphobic bs is this I notice
@TransAtheistPod @sophiaphotos I'll never understand the antipathy people have towards us
@BootlegGirl @InnerPartisan @CranBoonitz this guy seems upset about something
@TransAtheistPod @sophiaphotos "Haha this person thinks we're hateful" uhm 'cause yeah those comments totally don't sound antagonistic right
@cyberpunkfetish  yeah like... wtf. I love all of my trans dude friends :(
@emitans name one game ever that was improved by voice chat

NAME ONE
@burgeroise yes yes yes yes YES
@OhMiaGod if we call my loose friend circle a 'support group' it'd probably be what you want
@burgeroise Ranma and every cartoon episode where a male character pretended to be/was dressed up as/turned into a girl... &gt;.&gt;
just got off the phone with auto place, they're repo'ing my car next week

kinda sucks, but I legit can't afford it and don't have options


link for your convenienc

cw stylized gore art etc
Yo, peeps who dig my music, you can get a cd copy now if you check my bandcamp page. It'll help feed me!

cw for stylized gore in artwork.
@meowrobot could've been accidental?
@actuallyalice by the time The Simpsons dies nobody will remember that it was ever good
@Pinkham_Artemis Honestly the city itself is better than you'd expect, but FUCK our government.
@Pinkham_Artemis Yay my city! When the NDO here was first being kicked around a Dem politician wanted to remove trans protections. Yup.
@actuallyalice @KelestiMMO  I feel like Prime is still the better game but those are great points in Prime 2's favor
I kinda feel like I like the *idea* of sex more than I like actually having sex
fuck the cynicism I am DAMN excited at the new SW movie
@OhMiaGod @BootlegGirl  take away my homophobic friend and I g uarantee I would've done a LOT more stuff. Prob would've transitioned at 19
@leahvelcro if we can secure a date well ahead of time I can go ahead and get that day off. My schedule isn't remotely consistent :(
@leahvelcro Really sad we never got to hang out, but I guess things just didn't work.

I've got a friend in Mass, might ask if she's close!
I'm fuckin' 25 years old I feel like a sheltered hermit
....okay i don't really regret the drinking or drugs much but teh rest yeah
things I've never done that I wish I'd done
party
drink
drugs
play a live show
get buttfucked
kiss boys
@h34rken I.... I've never been to a party

I'm so sheltered ;_;
@h34rken @meauxdal nope :O
@meauxdal @h34rken   are those tats?
@janphar when I think privacy I definitely think of being very concerned with people in closed bathroom stalls
@OhPoorPup I don't know what those words mean

i'm accidentally sXe help
@ZJemptv 
fem girls = internalized misogyny
masc boys = gender conforming oppressors
fem boys = perverts
masc girls = enlightened
@ZJemptv oh look it's the "transitioning = gender conformity" argument
@jessiealtjquine old me never gendered my emails/usernames but now I give it things like "ms emmeline" or "mss scuttlebutt"
ｽｩｯ… 
I am a raging bisexual

jsyk
@OhMiaGod  write your presentation as a series of tweets
@NireBryce @ZJemptv "Gay day of NOISE!" would make an awesome queer  music festival name though
@NireBryce @ZJemptv I feel like i'd be cool with it if it was like "cishets shut the fuck up today and let queer ppl speak"
I want to re-do high school as pastel goth twink and I want to make it so when I came out everyone would've went "well duh"
is there a word for when you're depressed and you desperately try and find ways to blame yourself for literally everything that goes wrong?
@limenale @BootlegGirl 

I'm just gonna drop this here &gt;.&gt;
@emitans .

..

what
@emitans ..........only lumberjacks?

only into hard wood?

sexually attracted to home depot?
@BootlegGirl does this relate to Ziltoid the Omniscient at all?
@JamsEtYams @sophiaphotos SATX is better than expected but we still have lots of shits and we had to fight to keep the NDO trans inclusive
I think maybe I need a therapist and/or psychiatrist. I've been having depressive episodes w/ suicidal ideation more and more frequently
@tokimekiwaku "please creampie my gay ass" same tbqh
@lisasevern ok good at  first i was thinking like legos
@ZJemptv I don't know how they can do it. I've had my music heard by a few hundred strangers and that really freaked me out for a while
@OhMiaGod and I feel like saying "well yeah HRT has made my sads more sad" is basically like... admitting defeat or conceding to those ppl
@OhMiaGod I've known people who've been flat out told "SEE LOOK HOW EMOTIONAL YOU ARE YOU ARE CLEARLY WORSE OFF ON HRT YOU SHOULD STOP"
@OhMiaGod idk I don't like blaming hormones, it's almost feels like i'm admitting  that they haven't been 100% beneficial and have downsides
@OhMiaGod like this is almost as bad as  the episode that sent me to the hospital
@OhMiaGod I just feel so...s tupid and bratty

"oh boo hoo you didn't get to visit your friend long" and suddenly BOOM MEGA HARDCORE SAD
@OhMiaGod thank you
@OhMiaGod I appreciate knowing I've helped somebody
I called in and i'm just  bawling and crying and I feel so fucking path etic
i'm late.  nobody can/will give me a ride

too embarassed to call in or just show up extra late

i'm such a fucking failure
late late late late late
@ireneista we were gonna have a guest with a car visiting this weekend, stuff got dashed last minute and they had to leave ultra early
@ireneista already gonna be  late, 40 minute walk,and the lastthing I want is to  go on a long walk
gonna be  15  m inutes  late unless I fi nd someone who can give me a ride right away
@ireneista it's just work ... and I feel like shit today and it's the last thing I want to do

and i'd get in lots of trouble for calling in
i have to leave in like 3 minutes and i don't even have clothes on

i'm' responsible

fuck me 

I want to just collapse
is that a form of self destructive behavior?

idunno, right now i don't care, i just want to scream at everything
just make a few random people i'll never meet again walk away going "wow what a fucking bitch, can't stand her"
the whole while being excessively aggressive and hostile about it, even if it's a position I don't really agree with
i'm too chickenshit to do that so instead I want to dig my heels in arguing with random people about shit I don't even actually care about
i want to lay in a pit and just wait for sometihng to quickly, swiftly happen

I want to be torn a part while screaming "FUCK YOU"
fucking great i have twenty fucking minutes to get dressed and fucking WALK TO WORK AGAIN NICE 

I hate everything
....or even random people at home

and then I start hating on myself

sometimes all at once
personal pattern: get upset, stressed, or dip into a depressive state... start picking fights with random people online
@jessiexjquine *cheers you from the sidelines*
@jessiexjquine my partner's family has been amazing though, everybody switched names and pronouns no prob and treat me v well. &lt;3
@jessiexjquine  yup, they still don't get my name or pronouns right, which is part of why I kinda left town right after coming out.
@jessiexjquine my family didn't let me talk. I got "okay well we accept you :)" and then i'd get talked over and cut off and such
@jessiexjquine  like uhm I just told you i'm staying with my partner... who is a woman... 

do you even listen?
@jessiexjquine &gt; her reaction tot he latter was "well of course you arent gonna go become a woman just to be a lesbian that'd MAKE NO SENSE"
@jessiexjquine I got the same shit. Annoying.

Strangest was my aunt. Told her i'm staying with my partner, also admitted to liking men &gt;
@jessiexjquine mine was a total surprise to literally everyone. Made me kinda sad, 'cause I felt like nobody knew me at all
@jessiexjquine oy coming out? all the best

I relate a lot to that letter, particularly the whole being unkept and dressing 'practically'
@BootlegGirl I know that feeling very well
@VanguardVivian @tykat22 god I hope so
@peachcosmos A+ totally

I kinda prefer the sequel but that's more 'cause I played it more. Also Wendy &lt;3
@peachcosmos fourty fucking dollars holy shit
Plus, I was attracted to him and in a way he was my first love, even if I was reluctant to admit it. It just made me feel worse. @OhMiaGod
it just sucks 'cause I didn't really care if I got bullied, I just didn't want to lose my friend... @OhMiaGod
not even sure he remembers even saying things like "I swear if you turn out to be gay i'm going to kick your fucking ass"
he's gotten over the homophobic bs, he's cool with me today, but he doesn't know how that affected me and how much it hurt
today in making myself sad: unpacking how my friend's homophobia as a teenager pushed me into deep denial so I wouldn't lose him.
@jessiexjquine @cyberpunkfetish I want a tartan skirt wtf
@sophiaphotos *slams fave button so hard*
@ChelseaPoe666 @codeorangekids I missed th em when they played here in SATX :C
@sophiaphotos cultural attitudes need to change seriously

 what the fuck is wrong with people who think this shit is appropriate
@BootlegGirl i've vented on here about every community I've lost. Never named names 'cause they were small, but still
anybody else feel like GG has managed to p. much totally ruin every geek community on the internet?
@OhMiaGod "When the rebels destroyed the death star, they also killed all these countless innocent contractors"
@sophiaphotos how many surgeons are there total, worldwide I wonder? Always got the impression that it was just a small handful.
@ametur_poet skirt bottomzzz
@mizabitha when i used to collect I had literally hundreds of games I never played beyond the title screen

felt bad
@mizabitha i love that game
@ixKylie @StarKat99 so you played through Sonic Adventure 2???
@ZJemptv I sorta avoided thinking about it or talking about it much at all until I came out IDK if deliberately
idk if these are final but i'm happy with them right now 
+HIRS+ is so wonderful
i'm getting a drummer soon, whenever they get moved down here. 

they actually 100% *get* what I'm doing with my music. SO EXCITE.
@ireneista @BootlegGirl a lot of my stuff has random nods to dysphoria, transition, anticapitalism, depression and angsty shit, etc
@ireneista @BootlegGirl also the lyrics themselves are a lot of vague nonsense and shitty metaphor lol... it's like all I end up doing
@ireneista @BootlegGirl besides, I think my lyrics are by far my worst trait, frankly they exist to give my vocal syllables to blurt out
@ireneista @BootlegGirl idk the vocals are harsh and those styles don't put a lot of emphasis on being "understandable" so that's fine.


while it's on my mind this band has a female vocalist who sounds kinda like me and that makes me happy
@ireneista @BootlegGirl OH RIGHT uhm cw on that artwork, it's gorey
@ireneista @BootlegGirl &gt; nobody who's heard my stuff has questioned me being a girl or anything like that so ????
@ireneista @BootlegGirl 
『新ボーカリストの誕生だよ～っ！』 
ビームとミラーのステッキが…マイクに見える…ような…！！ 
@BootlegGirl 
@BootlegGirl not 'beauty and the beast' type things but i've been building up to doing crust punk dual male/female tradeoff vocals by myself
@fleetfootedfox ........eww
@fleetfootedfox I want to start an indie band called Silent Brain Words now but I don't know how to indie
@fleetfootedfox "it's hardcore but it's all feminism and stuff except for some of the fuckers who defend michfest fuck those people"
@fleetfootedfox fuck the government ugh
@fleetfootedfox wow, b ecause of that gender marker?

blegh... why the fuck is gender marker even important, legally speaking?
do I have a point? not really, other than I just don't care about Nightwish or Opeth or Arch Enemy or whatever the hell is popular right now
outside of certain spaces at least... some of which would probably get 'elitist' labels thrown around but i don't really care about that
and it's not like I listen to mega obscure stuff necessarily, but I mean... I don't run into a lot of people who I enjoy chatting metal with
like the stuff i'm into is often so far removed from this that sometimes it feels like a totally different genre and it's bizzare
Every once in a while  I get inklings of stuff happening in the 'mainstream' metal scene and I realize that I don't understand it at all
@kadybat  it looks a lot like the space colonies in Gundam....
@BootlegGirl @EmilyAviva there was an audio production podcast I used to listen to that made that joke with 'transistor'

so fucking cringey
@socarolinesays @CrazeeDayzeee I feel like this has happened before
I had to take a lukewarm/slightly cool shower

THIS IS MISERABLE

YOU PEOPLE WHO PREFER COLD SHOWERS ARE MASOCHISTS! MASOCHISTS I SAY!!!
@caephyn WHY ARE THERE CIS PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL WHAT CAN THEY POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTE FADSFSADFAFSFSASFSAFSDFA
@caephyn on one hand I think it's important for new trans ppl to learn that our lives arent 24/7 gloom but on the other hand wtf this panel
@ZJemptv same
@Greliz ....FOURTEEN YEARS AGO HOLY SHIT
@Greliz  yes that was my reaction 14 years ago
@kadybat  its okay you can angst to me i don't mind

i angst out sometimes too
@destroyed4com4t IMAGINE THAT THOUGH :O
@destroyed4com4t honestly when I first glance what I basically saw was Macho Man Randy Savage with devil wings and dress... I'm disappointed
@destroyed4com4t is that a fucking cowboy hat?

@jessiexjquine im jelly of your lips
@OhMiaGod agree on all thinhgs
@mizabitha she's said a LOT of shit, that was a long time ago, always stuck out to me for some reason
@mizabitha I remember she once said "SUCK MY TRANSGENDER DICK" and I keep wanting to insert that phrase into things but never find a way to
I really want to play my shit live
@ImprobableJoe  I should ask next time i'm down that way. Haven't had much in teh way of extra cash so i've been avoiding tempting places
@ImprobableJoe I figure there HAS to be cool shops around here. I mean I know where a cool local record store is, but no guitar places...
@ImprobableJoe I really need to find the good local shops.  All I've ran into here is a guitar center
@ImprobableJoe I HAVE LITERALLY DONE THIS LOL
@ImprobableJoe my solution was to hang out for 4 hours and then buy a 25c guitar pick on the way out

SEE? I'M A LEGIT PAYING CUSTOMER, SRS!
@ImprobableJoe I go  there to kill time and fuck with equipment i can't afford
not sure what i'd hate more in a guitar shop: making the old blues guys think i'm a tasteless hack or making metallica kids think i'm cool
fucking BOTS
@der_musiker what who are you go away
I kinda want to write music

but I don't wnat to go to the trouble of hooking up my amp, starting up my daw, etc

blegh
@quartzdyke that's cool my faucet knob thing is broke and I can only get lukewarm water out of that

fuck that

I need a *HOT* shower
@ThatSabineGirl "Metal" huh?

I bet he has awful taste and doesn't know his shit.
@ThatSabineGirl We just lost our car basically, and I already miss having it. Public transportation in Texas isn't great.
....but it's all still very alarming
tbqh I think there's going to be backlash from this as it makes conservatives look like blatant bullies and the laws won't last if they pass
I mean, these bills are outright blatant attacks on the trans community, which is way different than say, opposing an NDO
I mean you can literally murder us for who we are and there's legal avenues to say that was justified, but THEY need protection from US?
what gets me about all these anti-trans bills is how they paint a group that faces higher rates of violence and murder as the dangerous ones
@burgeroise I mean Tekken also lets you fight as a bear that counts for something surely
@leahvelcro "it's like that swelling thing ur clit does only bigger and more  cumbersome"
@CNIAngel @mcclure111  looks like a beatiful minimalist pixel art thingy
remember kids:

stay in school
don't do drugs
hail satan
@ticky @jessiexjquine  fuck yes pls
@OhPoorPup  oop nevermind misread that tweet to say literally the opposite of what you said
@OhPoorPup  do you necessarily need to leave Texas? I like it a lot here in SATX &gt;.&gt;
update, managed to dodge eviction for now, but any extra cash helps while we try and figure out a more long term solution @OhMiaGod
@Lyle_Bailey @OhPoorPup hipsters and gentrification?
LRT fuck hi-fi that's the kind of fi I want in my music
@emitans well I mean where ELSE are you going to pick up girls?
@AmyDentata well I mean there's Ladyfest
@profanegeometry same
@AmyDentata Who the hell even plays there anyways? Washed up riot grrl bands?
@ImprobableJoe yes
@ImprobableJoe absolutely

that's probably why there are no more neighborhood children
@burgeroise yeah, absolutely... I was kinda obsessed with that stuff pre-coming out too... for the same reasons. Now? It's kinda weird.
@burgeroise to be fair... I kinda ate that shit up when I first came out and started transitioning
@ImprobableJoe I usually use 'failed' batches of homemade salsa for it, and keep the 'success' batches for use as... well... salsa
@ImprobableJoe well okay edible salsa, you aren't gonna really taste it, it just k inda brings out flavors in the fajitas
@ImprobableJoe  yes, mix in a bit of good salsa with it when cooking

tastes gr8
@ImprobableJoe I JU ST MADE THOSE TODAY OMFG
@emitans the game itself does the "s/he" thing and it always bugged the SHIT out of me

like even gender aside it's still really bad form
@GivMeUrIndieLit  trying this tomorrow
@diezyn colons are great... FOR ME TO POOP WITH
@leahvelcro  ...yeah that'd  do it
@leahvelcro i am trying to think of a less appropriate context for cutesy clip-art
my landlord posted a p re-eviction noti ce 'cause we owe  $500

it's got cutesy clip art saying "TIME TO GO"

uhm.... seems inappropriate...
just to reiterate, I'm serious about this post. We literally cannot afford our current arrangement.
@willowhisky what kind of podcasts do you want?
staring down homelessness ain't fun yo, 'specially when the shits you thought would fix everything aren't actually enough
anyone wanting to move in and share a place with a trans lady and her partner in SATX???

we need a roommate :X
@OhMiaGod  gofundme requires a bank account which I don't have right now :(
@OhMiaGod in a nutshell: job doesn't pay me enough to survive here, m ath flat out doesn't work out. Also, losing the car due to merri's bro
hi i'm alive now
experiencing depressive episodes a lot lately. including suicidal thoughts. can't do shit about it either as we can barely survive as it is
so i lost internet.... again...
@ZJemptv god dammit stop being so correct
650 plays, 53 downloads

...2 purchases

lol
I can't listen to my stuff anymore, I just think of the literally hundreds of people who've heard it and freak out
t his all kinda blows my fucking mind
only criticisms seem to be that the image/art is 'kitschy' (which is totally intentional) and some people aren't into my vocals
found my album on another non-english forum  and people are just heaping all this praise on it and oh my god 

O_O
lol the russian pirate site uploaded the demos too

hahahaha
I don't even like Exodus that much but the main riff to Toxik Waltz is one of the most fucking catchy metal riffs ever
@BootlegGirl @Besomyka (*files away "Riddle For You" as a possible future song title*)
@BootlegGirl @Besomyka I've got a friend in Ohio willing to take us in

tbqh I'd rather not leave though, I genuinely like it here
got an email via bandcamp

"nice stuff lady"

that's it

that's the whole message

thnx commenter with 666 in ur username. I appreciate it.
I suspect the outcome of this thread is going to result in me leaving this place.
welp a forum i've been a regular at for the past 5 years (that i'm out on) just started a thread about what happened with obsidian

*gulp*
...so there's a russian pirate forum arguing over whether or not my music sounds like early Exodus.

teehee
@ImprobableJoe oh dear amazon prime likely wouldn't have much that I wanted to hear

plus my 'new music' has been like, bandcamp artists
I know what I like
my music library:
metal metal metal metal hardcore hardcore metal metal metal industrial metal metal metal grind grind metal metal metal
the fucking bonus track thing just tickles me pink, like whoever uploaded this l iked that song so much they thought it needed to be added
so i just found my album on what seems to be a russian pirate site. The best part is that they added a 'bonus' taken from the last demo
@OhPoorPup I don't even really listen to much hip hop (I have tons of respect for it though) and this seems like a given for near ANY genre
I may not have heard every genre classic but I have heard Celtic Frost's Vanity/Nemesis and I can tell you its p underrated
I love noticing how bands evolve and experiment and change styles and whatnot
doesn't help that i'm the kind of person who will get into one band at a time and try to slowly explore their whole discography
now I remember why I never finished these. Top 5-10 is easy. The rest? blegh, kinda becomes a smittering of 'eh I guess I'm into this album'
lol trying to do one of those top 50 album collages and it's super predictable if you've heard my music

like 90% thrash &amp; punky death metal
@OhPoorPup such a good album &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@OhPoorPup do I spy Unquestionable Presence? :O
@OhPoorPup one of these days I should do one of these

i've tried and stopped a bunch
i'm having someawful feels all the sudden
'life is pointless anyways' type feels
not gonna hurt myself, the feelings are passive. 
still...
@ireneista @BootlegGirl @JamsEtYams @icequeenerika throwing this out there re: deadnames. Everyone always got mine wrong anyways, lol.
@BootlegGirl  a lot of trans girls get put on T by transphobic parents trying to 'cure' them. 

it never works
@ImprobableJoe I once got added to a list of "insufferable cunts" and I still do not understand how or why

was totally proud of it though
@ImprobableJoe I like podcasts a lot, but really good ones are hard to come by. I still haven't found a good metal one
@ImprobableJoe now there's like one podcast I still listen to ('cause the hosts of nice chemistry and are pretty funny) but that's about it
@ImprobableJoe Yeah, I mean I was kinda following a lot of atheist and skeptic types closely for a while, but I just grew tired of it.
@ImprobableJoe honestly it's mostly people who dedicate most of their time to fighting GG stuff. Kinda tired of seeing it all the time.
@ImprobableJoe I'D NEVER!!! :O
I feel like I should trim my follower list. Too lazy right now though

(don't worry, if we interact you're not going to be unfollowed)
I am trying to actually run around and do 'promotional' stuff with this and I feel like the most massive fuckin' tool lmao


I feel like I've accomplished something for some reason lol
@BootlegGirl  golly didn't expect the RT, thanks for that
(oh hey and you know I mean... I wouldn't complain if you were to like... buy my music or something... like it would help a lot right now)
@mizabitha now it's stuck in my head
@OhMiaGod should be right there in my timeline, I like just tweeted it a minute ago
@OhMiaGod there's a new one uploaded now

the art is... provocative

and kinda NSFW

i'm proud of it all though
sharing my music is utterly terrifying a lot of the time tbqh

makes me feel vulnerable
this is a link to my new album in case u didn't know
so this is done now

warning: artwork contains guts and boobs and lots of pink:


@profanegeometry ...idk I just feel like an asshole even talking about it, like i'm making excuses...  

blarghrewr
@profanegeometry I'm just sick of being spacey and distracted and feeling all squirmy at times even when I don't have the energy to squirm
@profanegeometry  argh I kinda want to get on ADHD meds again, haven't had them since I was a kid and I clearly still have all the symptoms
@ThatSabineGirl @ElizSimins and I think there's a difference between a call-out and a mob  

call-outs are important, mobs are dangerous
@ThatSabineGirl @ElizSimins I feel like there's a subset of 'social justice' types who basically want a justified reason to go all 4chan mob
lol wait nevermind Merri's cursive is  perf
hey do I have any friends with pretty cursive handwriting?
warning ahead of time on the album art: it's cartoony and black and white, but it's also very violent and there is nudity

might do alt art
depending on how smooth it all goes this will be ready to release in a day or two
music update: everything is all lined up, gonna give the whole recording a listen and see if I need to make any changes
@ShayBlez  yeah about my length. I can't seem to get it any longer

gosh that color is pretty
@ShayBlez smart

I wish my hair was less poofy and frizzy, but I kinda I blame 10 years of not really taking care of it
@ShayBlez HOW DO YOU GET SUCH PRESENTABLE HAIR SO EASILY
@ShayBlez my girlfriend thinks you're lying about that being a first thing in the morning image lol
@ShayBlez your hair looks better than mine
@ShayBlez  well here's me doing the same thing 
my car is dead and there's all these shows coming up that I want to see

Ghoul, Master, Melvins, Melt Banana, *cries*
@ShayBlez this is a really nice image of you

also your hair omg &lt;3
@cyberpunkfetish I've heard 'normal range' as high as like 5-600 

either way 1600 is way too much

kinda got me worried 'cause i'm on 10mg
@emitans @_OpheliaBlack I feel like I know a lot of demigirls
@angille *hides*
@angille I've been growing my hair for nearly a decade and it is barely mid back ;_;
@angille peanut butter and fucking JELLY
at least that's how it is for me

like I accidentally boosted this fader by a ton, turned out to sound really great actually

like ok
mixing is a lot like programming in that by the time everything finally clicks into place and works you aren't totally sure what you did
oh my god why is april fools so consistently fucking obnoxious
@emitans  *joins crowd of people saying 'yes'*
@LynnMagic @BootlegGirl  never understood why 'political lesbianism' is okay but trans lesbians are 'appropriating lesbianism'
thins that annoy me:

extreme metal where the vocals are mixed super loud like it's a dang pop song

don't do this pls
@h34rken  *thinks about hers too*

nope

don't like 'em

@mizabitha I've had this problem for weeks now
@mizabitha I end up going on p long walks almost every day since I have to walk to work, I don't think its helping :(
*chucks recording equipment at a wall*
I just hate this, gargling salt water didn't do shit, my vocals still sound raspy and lack power

I normally like my vocals but these SUCK
like as in 'no-way-can-I-release-this-as-is' awful

plus  I 'm getting rendering errors and shit which I have to carefully work out
so I bute force finished tracking vocals and l ike maybe half of the songs are passable vocally and the rest are awful performances
@evilgaywitch my answer would be something like "play some Coroner"
So @hikikomerri stumbles onto BDSM art of Quistis from FF8

I informed her that Quistis's in game weapon is literally a whip

she lol'd hard
there's like, intestinal gnawing and stuff

but it's  also cartoony and really stylized
@OhPoorPup  I kinda dig the concept b ut i'm not sure ab out the execution
@BroadcastEmu @duckinator  I genuinely thought  it was a bass guitar practice amp when I saw the pic until I read the tweet
well this album art is turning out way more... gorey than expected
presented without context:

"Is... is  that a bisexual doughnut?"
@caephyn well I mean you see they call us anti-feminist becuz we call them trans exclusionary, because they... are inclusive? I can't even.
is there any interest in physical CDs of my music?

I mean I think it'd be cool but yeah
so according to some IRC stats 0.78% of all of my words are swears. That makes me by far the foulest user in the channel. So fuckin proud!
someone pointed out to me taht my vocal issues might be due to allergies.

spring in a new city and slightly different climate after all
you know a trans symbol necklace or a bracelet in trans pride colors or something would be perfect for these situations
@ShayBlez on one hand, that... on the other, thi sis SATX, we're EVERYWHERE here
*see customer, notice they're trans*
*think about saying something*
*say nothing 'cause pointing out that yr both trans would be rude as fuk
my ID  pic is old, I have a beard in it, took some wrangling to let them do what they needed without seeing my photo. @meauxdal
yeah like none of my co-workers seem to know  i'm trans. One needed my ID for something and I nearly had a fucking panic attack &gt; @meauxdal
I feel weird as hell about this
I think i'm accidentally stealth....
*at store* oh I should buy BBQ sauce
*buys*
*gets  home*
*finds IDENTITCAL UNOPENED  BOTTLE in cabinet.*
also I cater my language to my tone. casual places i'll play loosely. more formal/serious situations i'm less loose. I suspect most do this.
idk I just hate these abe simpson fuckers who think thing things they don't partake in are inferior because they don't partake in it
even calling  us less intelligent and shit

psst, it's not that we don't know/understand the rules, we break them on purpose
like seriously shit these people were claiming that youth today LITERALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND PUNCTUATION outside of emotes goddamn
saw some article about  twitter speak eschewing language 'rules' and the comments were people claiming it's a sign of society's downfall lol
@evilgaywitch I just started working there and the fucking second I get used to saying that I get told I don't have to say that anymore
seriously tracking vocals has been by far the hardest part of making  this recording and I feel fucking exhausted trying to do them
listening back to my vocal takes from a few days ago

I sound tired in all of  them and they lack the 'edge' that I want from my vocals

ugh
@tokimekiwaku oy I hate to be THIS kind of person, but my paycheck came out WAY short so i'm gonna have to cancel the request. sorry :(
@destroyed4com4t @auntysarah all my hormones together cost me like $40-50 a  month :/
@hachidorii only person in my family I told was my mom.

the rest of the family knows now anyways

they're p accepting but ugh so clueless
@tokimekiwaku  *pokes* &gt;.&gt;  was curious if you've come up with any ideas or anything yet.  Hope I don't come across as pushy, I know ur busy
@ixKylie "That's not my child! it's the COMPUTER'S!" 

actual thing he said
update to my vocal situation: I can't really talk now, and if I yawn or something it genuinely hurts 

ouch wtf did I do D: @SarahJFarron
@leahvelcro @ixKylie  my mom's ex literally accused her of doing this when she got pregnant

it was amusing
my ears are fatigued, i don't know what i'm doing anymore, this album probably  sounds like a mud bucket but I can't tell
@SarahJFarron idk i've only got 4 left, hopefully I can knock those out tomorrow

also listened back to the 'ill' take... nvm lol. its bad
The "ill" take kinda works for the song though and i'm debating keeping it, but i'm done for today @SarahJFarron
possibly, I knocked out 8 tracks and then ate food and when I came back I like suddenly got the worst headache @SarahJFarron
idk what the fuck I did but my voice is wrecked for the day to say the least. Last take I did I sounded ill and it was painful to do &gt;&gt;
OUCH WHAT THE FUCK  

I've been doing vocals all day, took a break, ate  lunch, started working again and suddenly WORST FUCKING HEADACHE!!!
@eclecticbrotha @janphar  I kinda want a shirt that says that on it.. "proud  member of the marching blah blah"
@EmmaQuack make that 6 tracks &lt;3
finally getting vocals done

 finished 5 tracks and i'm totes ready to do 7 more :3
every time I play SMB3 I get to level 8-1 and I give up
which I mean, a defunct podcast isn't necessarily bad, but if its centered around news for topics... yeah  it can be odd
most of the ones I've found in this vein are defunct :/
I can't seem to find a good queer podcast, not looking for anything interview focused, just likeable, funny hosts w good chemistry chatting
@RiotJayne   you'll never defeat andross
lol going to work in like 40 minutes and i am not ready
how'z about a lunch break selfie? 
when you hit that point during music production where you have heard your songs 100 billion times and now fucking hate them with a passion
@janphar @destroyed4com4t Zimmerman is seriously fucking determined to stay in the news
@AmyDentata @DrPalutena too bad it never really took off, I remember finding it and immediately asking a local friend if it was hers

it was
@DrPalutena @AmyDentata best trans org name I ever saw was the San Antonio Transgender Advocacy Network, aka SATAN
@SarahJFarron @BootlegGirl yeah we kinda chat a bunch on twitter I've noticed, i'm always waltzing into her mentions &gt;.&gt;
@SarahJFarron  oh yay!! :D
@BootlegGirl @OhMiaGod &gt;people in my life who I don't want to condemn, and because it's actually kinda complicated to approach
@BootlegGirl @OhMiaGod I had different things blocking me from exploring my identity. Getting into it would be difficult without condemning&gt;
@OhMiaGod for me my big issue is not coming out at like 19/20. I wanted to secretly get on hormones, but life things got in the way
@destroyed4com4t I am buying so chocolate syrup when I get off work today and drinking gallons and gallons of chocomilk
@OhMiaGod yea I feel like dysphoria has been getting worse and worse for me lately. Lots of "why couldn't I have been born a cis girl" feels
@destroyed4com4t  god i want chocolate and coffee right now

especially chocolate holy shit
@GivMeUrIndieLit I kinda needed to hear this right now tbqh
@BootlegGirl uhm....  when my partner identified as straight??? I don't think she ever did that though
@GivMeUrIndieLit we're also unfortunately in a shit society that doesn't take oppressed concerns seriously until oppressors vouch for them
@BootlegGirl ....that 's a femininity thing? I've never associated it with that...
transphobes who's argument against trans inclusion in bathrooms etc amounts to "but trans people are icky!"
@sophiaphotos  not to mention all the trans people advocating legal ID change etc as the barometer for who's 'truly trans'  and crap :/
@sophiaphotos ugh why did I read literally all of the comments, even the 'supportive' people are still calling the trans woman a man :/
@0xabad1dea human flesh completes the stew
@GivMeUrIndieLit I see, so it's more trying to de-legitimize being trans by acting like its inferior to being 'gender nonconforming' :(
@A1B24C15D13E35  I love grindcore and shitposting though
@GivMeUrIndieLit idk I am knee jerking 'cause my brain is jumping to "trans people just reify gender roles!" shit and I know you aren't that
@GivMeUrIndieLit I feel like rejecting the set of expectations for your assigned gender (even to just adopt another set) is notable anyways
in fact I can't think of **anything** i'm into that I don't have issues with the community around it....
just thinking about it there's a LOT of things I like that I generally dislike large swathes of the community around it
@ColdmanHot funfact I have a physical copy of this on PS2

it's one of the few games I still own
@destroyed4com4t ISN'T IT GREAT????
@destroyed4com4t (btw i'm referring to this if you're curious: 
@destroyed4com4t but will it sound good with black metal riffs played over it?
@emitans &lt;3
@OhPoorPup this is my favorite reading of NiGHTs jsyk
that feeling when you're all self concious about your vocals 'casue you think you sound too much like a dude
@TransAtheistPod @AtheistExpShow @Matt_Dillahunty come to san antonio instead we've got uhm..

well it's really nice here and fewer hipsters
@TransAtheistPod DFW seems to be the worst of the Texas Triangle places
@tokimekiwaku goddamn these are glorious
@h34rken oy yeah, the past can hit like a ton of bricks like that sometimes :(

always slipping away
or better yet, I want to hear stuff like this done with original chiptune compositions and arrangements made with the metal bits in mind
@ZJemptv  gosh I feel like it's been forever since you've done atheist stuff, almost feels like a throwback lol
I want to hear more NES music with black metal riffing happening over it for no real reason
I wan tto tag a bunch of people but idk who


omfg this is awesome, it's like chiptunes + black metal and it makes me smile so much

so goofy but I love it
@NireBryce in any case you definitely have me thinking more about my laguage usage regarding this
@NireBryce yeah I've never used it as a noun afaik. I def wouldn't use it to refer to people who've asked me not to use it though.
@NireBryce I've used "enby friend" and such when referring to nonbinary friends and such. If they identify more specifically I'll use that.
@h34rken toss up between 1 and 4 for me (I think  1 and 4? top left and bottom left)
@NireBryce yeah fuck that asterisk

at best its redundant, at worst its exclusionary and harmful
@NireBryce i'm not really sure how to approach 'nonbinary' otherwise without acknowleging that a binary system exists to not be part of
@NemoWoodbine  yeah idk I kinda picked Emmeline BECAUSE I could shorten it when I feel like. My old name wasn't one you could shorten...
@NireBryce I've caught crap for referring to myself as a girl before and I get kinda peeved about people policing that.
@NireBryce I kinda use "boy" "girl" and "enby" a lot BECAUSE it's cutesy and honestly I mean it to reflect more on me than on someone else.
@h34rken I litearlly do not understand how nobody at my apartment has ever complained about me
actually my name is Emmeline but I tend to go by Emma and everyone calls me Emma so ................
@fleetfootedfox like "WHAT THE FUCK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR TWO AMIES ON HERE *BLOCKS FOREVER*"?
*sees another trans Emma on twitter*

*follows*
@h34rken  i'm pretty sure if I "sung" via skype it'd probably be a clippy mess

I get very loud and turn the gain way down for vocals &gt;.&gt;
@h34rken  hahaha 

my voice is croaking so much right now but I think I got a song tracked at least
is Chris Barnes real
@leahvelcro I... I don't know how to use autotune plugins D:
@h34rken and then when I continue anyways I just sound like Chris Barnes and I *hate* Chris Barnes's voice
@h34rken honestly I just lose breath and stuff, I'll get like a few really awesome sounding lines and then i'm like *choke* *gag*
I don't mean like autotune or something &gt;.&gt;

how would autotuned screams sound anyways
and by 'studio trickery' I mean i'm just recording the lines in parts so I don't wear out by the end of the song trying to do one perf take
I like my vocals but I am kinda a shitty vocalist tbqh my breath control is awful

..........but studio trickery can fix that &gt;.&gt;
@hikikomerri I love you merri
I'm really happy with the revisions and rerecordings of the some of the old material on this album i'm working on :)
@emily_esque @BootlegGirl I knew I was trans at 12 and that shit basically kept me from identifying as trans until I was 24
@BootlegGirl I used to use it as a shield to claim i'm NOT trans lol. It was my go to denial.
@BerserkerLord1 @destroyed4com4t it's a label chosen exclusively to make their opponents look bad by dissociation. "you're pro gender"
@DrPalutena @BootlegGirl "steers and queers" or something like that
@BootlegGirl I forget that you're also from Texas.  I know lots of  TX trans women actually, a curious amount. Wonder what's up with that
@caitstuff like trees coming to life and grabbing people and simulating medieval torture racks or something
@caitstuff   oops, I misread as water...

Earth,hmmm... I 'm thinking the infamous tree scene from Evil Dead without the rapey stuff
@caitstuff waterboarding type thing?
@h34rken i'm hoping to get thi ngs done today assuming my DAW doesn't keep fucking crashing
@meauxdal yeah that's me


never did link this, but I helped on this death/doom metal album.

I did the second guitar solo on "ilchester"
@tokimekiwaku oh if you use the logo, feel free to do whatever you want to it. Change colors, re-draw, etc, or even don't use at all.
wow it s late i should go to bed problably

dang afternoon naps
@ireneista @tesseractiv @BootlegGirl the only reason I don't differentiate between the types is cuz they kinda bleed into eachother for me
@ireneista @BootlegGirl &gt; so I kinda sorta have an idea where you're coming from
@ireneista @BootlegGirl yeah, no I mean it metaphorically, though it can feel REALLY vivid at times. My partner is multiple (median?) tho &gt;
@ireneista @BootlegGirl &gt; but that's another topic entirely
@ireneista @BootlegGirl yeah.... it's part of the reason I harbor a weird hatred of my past self, I feel as if he hurt me out of fear &gt;
@ireneista @BootlegGirl  omg yes this, I feel that way sometimes without thinking about it, like being  into girls undermined being trans...
@ireneista @BootlegGirl yeah, i'm getting over it, it's a process, but it's clear to me now that I do genuinely find women attractive
@BootlegGirl @ireneista &gt; of it was genuine attraction vs how much was just envy
@BootlegGirl @ireneista honestly my attraction to women post-coming out caused me some distress, 'cause I couldn't figure out how much &gt;
@BootlegGirl I do know that I used to feel that getting w/ a girl would stop me from wanting to be a girl so much, lusting after dudes, etc
@ireneista @BootlegGirl absolutely, I just sorta feel weird actually owning 'bisexual' as a label, even if I think it describes me best
@ireneista @BootlegGirl I find myself rolling with either queer or lesbian most of the time (as I am in a long term relationship w a woman)
@ireneista @BootlegGirl I consider myself bisexual these days but part of me really regrets not just coming out as gay in high school
@OhPoorPup  goddamm it  thanks to this post i now have shitty metallica accounts following me goddammit

I don't even LIKE THAT BAND GEEZ
@leahvelcro yus it does, looking at having it done by the end of the month :3
@leahvelcro @OhPoorPup @meauxdal @datacicada this took me a moment to adjust to cuz i've been working on a mix all day

i like tho, swirly
@h34rken okay so you're not going months without at least, that's good. I've gone a few days without E from just missing doses and oy

I
@h34rken how long until you can get back on it?
@OhPoorPup sludge and black metal are actually kinda big genre blind spots for me too so i'm not super into Kylesa

but that's dang awesome
@OhPoorPup 'course nowadays I know lots and lots about metal and fuck all about most anything else 

oh well I know what I like
@ShayBlez you're very welcome &lt;3. I just found that those worked best/were most economical when I came out and began actually shaving daily
@ShayBlez 'fraid I don't know muhc... I'm a cheapass who buys the cheapest stuff she can grab &gt;.&gt;

but i'm sure google can help you
@OhPoorPup I listened to Metallica's s/t when it came out... in 1991... I was born in '89... thx mom. &gt;.&gt;
@ShayBlez take your time, watch the angle, Use very little pressure, let the weight of the blade do the cutting.
@OhPoorPup PSH I ALREADY KNEW THE MUSIC IN GH/ROCK BAND WHAT A LOSER

*first heard Motorhead via Tony Hawk*
@ShayBlez there is a bit of a learning curve, but I find I get FEWER cuts vs multibladed monstrosities.

plus they get me so goddamn SMOOTH
@ShayBlez safety razors have been the best bang for my buck tbqh

I shave everything with them
@tokimekiwaku at least it isn't heteroangst
@evilgaywitch @0xabad1dea @FioraAeterna *remembers getting gasps at opposing the Iraq War in 6th or 7th grade*
@ShayBlez @profanegeometry KINDNESS TO ALL GENDERS KICK!!!
@vivian_games eh fwiw that  theory sounds like utter BS if it's the one I'm thinking of and I SERIOUSLY don't see it happening
al I want is my fuckin' pizza gift card so I can eat fud :C
ugh paypal sucks
hey metal/rock fan followers! how do you feel about bands with 1 guitarist who track rhythm parts for solos on albums? Working on my own atm
@Pinkham_Artemis cis people not knowing what the fuck they're on about again
@tokimekiwaku 
here's some rar'd hi res logos, use if you want or do something new, up to you
@tokimekiwaku 12" x  12" @ 300 dpi would be ideal, that way anything print wise will be covered
@KelestiMMO that's a p reasonable way to use it, but the potential for abuse is super high and I doubt that that's the intend ed purpose
The fact that there are tools to track who unfollows you on twitter and tumblr strikes me as extremely creepy
@stavvers can I just buy those snazzy boots they're wearing for 4 then?
@sailorswayze where does snaggletooth fit in here
@tokimekiwaku sooo  band name is "Violent Pastels" and the album title is "Princess of  the Morgue" if that gives you any ideas &lt;3
@evilgaywitch hey my TL did a thing 
my vocals were shitty today and then I ate a pizza nad suddenly they sound right again

I am literally pizza powered
@qqnosh but ar en't DIMPs games and classic sonic the same??????????
@qqnosh I think they're remembering the game being way faster than it actually was
@qqnosh uhm wouldn't that apply to MOST platformers?
@tokimekiwaku do you think you could follow me back so I can use twitter DM? thx
@tokimekiwaku apparently I need a smartphone to use it? Won't let me use the PC version without it... I don't have a smartphone, blargl
@tokimekiwaku  other than wanting it to fit the music not really I kinda wanna see what you've got in mind first and we can work from there
@tokimekiwaku  I do have a logo yes, I'll rar all that stuff up and send it along tomorrow or so, getting sleepy right now
@tokimekiwaku  I dont have LINE, I can get one though, or we can just use twitter  DMs I suppose
@tokimekiwaku no specific date, just "end of the month"

do you have a better contact method? skype, etc? twitter is kinda awkward for this
@tokimekiwaku the album is aggressive thrashy metalpunk that deals with depression and transphobia. Very 'fuck you' and a good bit queer.
@tokimekiwaku 
a) Right now my budget is around $90
b) end of the month maybe? not a hard deadline
c) figure we can hammer this out a bit?

@tokimekiwaku I know you're mega busy but is there any way I could ask about commissioning album art from you? Willing to pay.
I can't think of shit for album art ugh
@emitans I like the suggestion @mcclure111 had of mentally pronouncing 'females' like 'tamales'
@ImprobableJoe   that sounds like an entirely different creepy fetishy movie
@ImprobableJoe   I did not see Tusk  actually :C
@ImprobableJoe I kind of genuinely love mallrats so this is good news 2 me
@icequeenerika @tykat22 I'm on 200mg of spiro/day and I haven't really experienced this fwiw
@mizabitha srsly cars are wildly expensive
@DrJaneChi  reactionary conservatives seem to be getting particularly reactionary and bold lately
i like  frogs
@ImprobableJoe needed the floyd mostly, tracking stuff nad there's divebomby bits in like... one song
I don't have any way to get new strings atm

so yeah

this 
kinda sucks
*picks up other guitar* 
*notices the high E string snapped at some point*
*it's a floyd so the whole thing is now out of tune

oh 

oh okay
I just had someone in an IRC pretend to feel me up

I feel really fucking icky and violated right now
@TheTenumi people would think you're bad for it?????
I have 10 songs to track total, so.... idk maybe i'll get it done tomorrow
i tracked 4 songs guitar wise and then suddenly my arms became pu dding and I couldn't do a 5th

gargh
MELT BANANA IS PLAYING IN AUSTIN!!!!! *explodes*
@resoluteCourier @vivian_games ...then g g happened
@resoluteCourier @vivian_games the thing I always heard most from gamers was that we need to treat games more like art and less like product
@emcorrigible I actually came from Abilene, which is pretty dead. Moved away when I came out, so I haven't livd here too long. I love it tho
@emcorrigible haven't been able to do much here since i'm basically solo. Austin has more music in general but SA certainly gets stuff
@emcorrigible golly &lt;3 praising my music is the fastest way into my heart jsyk

working on another release right now actually, a full length
@emcorrigible i've changed my username a few times but I went back over to this one 'cause it's just great +  its a nice devin townsend nod
@emcorrigible &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@emcorrigible did you follow me 'cause i'm also a trans Emma? XP
@sophiaphotos I doubt this photo was originally made with a political point in mind

I feel this way about a lo tof these bathroom pics tbqh
@allisonkilkenny everyone is a girl, all of us, every single one
@papierhache I just realized that, hence the tweet delete :X feeling abit silly now... though Gaiman's been problematic about stuff before
@OhMiaGod the way people react when problematic elements of media they like is really puzzling to me
programming drums makes me unhappy
my apartment is CLEAN for once!!! :O
@caitstuff one day when my car works we'll go hang out in seedy coffee shops with  you
you know I always get sad when I see media portraying nice sibling relationships

my relationship with my siblings is p bad and i'm envious
@DrPalutena @kadybat @emitans yeah I get that too, it's just ridiculously ignorant and like you said... they should know better
@kadybat @emitans @DrPalutena I mean how often are we thrown under the bus for the sake of convenience? :/
@kadybat @emitans @DrPalutena  the autoban thing sounds like a poor attempt at curbing people throwing around 'gay' etc as insults
I will never stop talking about how Catherine is about how cis people suck

idc that the game doesn't really support that

headcanons y'all
@vivian_games I mean it's a game where the only decent human being is a trans woman. the message is 'cis ppl suck' and i'm sticking to it
@aliendovecote I mean he makes "FISH WITH ROBOT LEGS" genuinely scary
@aliendovecote his storylines are silly but they're executed SO WELL
@hunktears  every character in that show is so obliviously queer
@actualjellyfish I hear ya, even trans stuff aside my home isn't a very happy place
@actualjellyfish tbqh I'd rather never go back to my hometown, but I promised family I'd visit... blegh.
@actualjellyfish &gt;was always this way
@actualjellyfish part of me ju st wants to go back home and casually visit old acquaintances and like, see how many I could convince that I&gt;
@actualjellyfish I also want to know, even though a few ppl from high school still know me and i'm sure they've told others
internet got cut off :( ...also no phone... or car... fuck.
@emitans you can actually.... though you get a game over for it lol
drummer I really wanted to work with ended up having to bail :C
anyone out there with a kit who wants to play on a queer metalpunk project?
@OhPoorPup Japan's underground/extreme metal and hardcore punk scenes are pretty awesome and very interesting too
@srhbutts @FakeRobotGamer also this opinion is common among fuckbuckets who have no clue wtf they're talking about
@srhbutts &gt;avfm8&lt;
@Deer_ebooks @tykat22 I just literally winced and felt my throat prepare to regurgitate food i'd eaten earlier today
@jephjacques I've been on HRT for several months and I'm still waiting for my eye beams.

I've got firey breath now though
@leahvelleman bathroom metal

literally from the BOWELS OF HELL
I just did a guest guitar solo for a groovy death/doom project and I love the songs
I like punky metal and I like metallic punk
@leahvelcro this is very relatable
@burgeroise no please dont stop i can't get enough of this
@OhMiaGod (wearing pigtails was a lifelong dream btw)
when your long time friend comes out as trans and you see her presenting for the first time and she's fucking GORGEOUS
@destroyed4com4t this is beyond hilarious
@OhMiaGod I was kinda forced to have it up for work.... hated it, felt awful, etc...

now i'm always putting it up, in many dif styles!
@mcclure111 I got a Devin Townsend song

...also not arguing
@OhMiaGod I did literally this. In fact, I used to really really really hate even so much as tying my hair back.
@OhMiaGod sorry for not being very talkative on skype today, was dealing with stuff at home
@burgeroise |||ROOT FOR SPEED
@angille and that suace? bbq? worchestershire?
@angille o yay
@angille what are those white meat looking bits?
i'm just so glum and sad today
"globule"
@vivian_games did not expect nipples
@FakeRobotGamer @KelestiMMO The World Ends With You, Too?
@FakeRobotGamer But chrono cro- *shot*
@AmyDentata @ParkerMolloy yeah seriously :|
@AmyDentata @ParkerMolloy no shut up we're done with racism now okay why are you bringing up race R U THE REAL RACIST? /sarcasm
@burgeroise but I love a good bad pun too much to resist :X
@burgeroise tbqh a gaytm would be neat
@papierhache it's way easier for a cis male predator toj ust say "i'm a trans guy i'm supposed to be in here" than fake being a tw
@tsundere_girl @AikoChanIsAwsum that show was fascinating
as cathartic as it is to laugh and scream at the people  and attitudes behind these kind of bills, they legit scare me. I just want to pee
if that Texas bathroom bill gets somewhere I'd have to move... and I can't move, logistically it's impossible. Plus I really like it here.
@mintchipleaf always read your name as Mintchi Pleaf
@SmartAssJen last time someone brought this up it triggered an interesting reaction in me where I realized how much I extremely hated old me
@aliendovecote I AM FULLTIME SOMEHOW AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW EITHER
@ShayBlez @MsBlackhart it does suggest poor technique... but yeah, relax, loosen up, getting tense never helps
@Pinkham_Artemis and it's never something that helped the movie. Highlander had a shitty scene that didn't need to be there for example
@Pinkham_Artemis it's kind amazing to go back and watch a lot of 80s movies and see how much casual blatant homophobia there was
@Lesmocon @tauriqmoosa especially a fanboy of the *worst* major promotion right now

I don't even watch wrestling and I know WWE is awful
@RozKaveney @ThatSabineGirl ofc they do. We threaten their worldview, so we need to be portrayed as dangerous liars and perverts.
@RozKaveney @ThatSabineGirl it didn't let them demonize us tho, hence what they use now. We're 'pro gender' while they're 'critical' of it
@RozKaveney @ThatSabineGirl They were pretty open about using it for themselves for a long time I'd say they know they're full of it
@OhMiaGod &lt;3 g'night!
@OhMiaGod gosh  like... woah... never really expected i'd inspire anyone :X
@OhMiaGod thank you, I appreciate that a lot &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@sunsetgorgon @destroyed4com4t "You're not REALLY a magic porcupine who can travel at supersonic speeds" like okay???
@sunsetgorgon @destroyed4com4t but I thought they thought that trans wasn't really a thing? How can you possibly be 'not really trans'?
@Roto13 @emitans "And what Mario game would be complete without water? Why water is practically a Mario trademark!"
@MrMMarsh you'll have to settle for poorly translating puns in a different language
@MrMMarsh they have tabletop RPGs on the internet now, which is now available on computers
@EMKrrgn @OhMiaGod What is a MAN!? A MISERABLE LITTLE PILE OF TESTOSTERONE INJECTIONS
@EMKrrgn @OhMiaGod Perhaps the same could be said of all socialized healthcare...
@EMKrrgn @OhMiaGod It was not by my hand that I am once again given flesh. I was called here by humans who wish to transition.
@OhMiaGod @EMKrrgn After drawing your blood into vials for bloodwork they go in back and sip it, saying things like "hmm T is still high."
@mcclure111 i've taken ibuprofen while on spiro...so have lots of friends. Wasn't aware that there were any issues
I just sneezed so hard it made me fart
@OhMiaGod   yeah...

ugh I don't even know how much debt i'm in, i'm scared to figure it out
@OhMiaGod it's so hard to break that 'pride' barrier... i could barely bring myself to apply for foodstamps

idk how much it'd help either
uhm at what point is it like... acceptable to do a gofundme thing
oh nice my bank account is going to be closed in 15 days
@snowth it snows in abilene but yes  I hate this cold

my car broke, then it got super cold and I have to walk

bullshitttt
@Nighteagle0010 @icequeenerika tbqh i think i'm just lucky, my boobs aren't in pain often either, though they grow pretty steadily
@Nighteagle0010 @icequeenerika I don't really have this... I mean when I pee I seem to pee a lot more but it's like... once every 5 hoursish
@snowth *wiggles*

san antonio &gt; austin

*wiggles again*
@OhMiaGod it's okay like most of the stuff I wea r is actually stuff my girlfriend used to wear in high school
even if I like a job going into work still annoys me
i like this new job, my co-workers are cool

there's only two guys in the whole store

this is nice
@destroyed4com4t @leftytgirl I like it in SATX

Austin can keep it's hipster bullshit

too many to favorite and retweet
@NireBryce I think the concept of 'butch trans woman' blows their fucking minds
@alysoncmcmanus @ZJemptv YUSSS PARTYYYY
@alysoncmcmanus @ZJemptv getting ready to start a job... as me!!!

boymode is DEAD!!!
@ThatSabineGirl "I WAS YOUR ALLY BUT I'M DONE Y'ALL JUST TURNED ME AWAY!!!!"
@ThatSabineGirl ugh so much, ppl tossing slurs in a strained attempt to piss me off? Meh. The ones who think they're doing us a favor? Nooo.
@ThatSabineGirl "the moment either side allows their [...] buzzwords to taint their objectivity" "Cultral Marxist"
@ThatSabineGirl "I'm not 'cis' I'm NORMAL!!!!" fuck you fuck you fycjk yourjekwl
@oolon @jaythenerdkid lol everybody thinks the block bot is all about them
@bunydoll yeah, i've got a few freinds up in Austin though, still haven't made the time to go visit
@bunydoll poop that sounds fun too bad i'm in satx and don't have a car right now
woah ha watching that counter fly up when you click that stats button on your own tweets is amusing
it'd probably be ruined by transphobes after like a month though let's be honest  we aren't allowed to have nice things
Anybody else kinda hoping that "nuke" becomes a cute term amongst trans folk to refer to each other?
I got a phone call from a number that was simply 1-000-000-0000

that's some creepypasta shit
oh my god I leave  the house for like an hour and suddenly the internet explodes over the colors of an ugly dress
Merri: "don't poop in the tub"

ugh fine
ohj yup looks like it's about to start, ppl already trolling it

that was fast
there's a nice hashtag about getting rid of gendered bathrooms

wanna take bets on how long before you-know-whos start flooding it?
@chapien @BootlegGirl @mololabo @kadybat also someone correct me if i'm wrong but aren't all of japan's public restrooms co-ed too?
@S0phieH LOVE
@chapien @BootlegGirl @mololabo @kadybat it'll happen eventually I think. Austin for example already requires all single stall RRs to be uni
voice training videos that emphasize that women use 'different language' and 'don't swear as often' and that you shouldn't either

fuck that
@ixKylie this works too . Friend of mine was talking about going up there but I don't think she can make it
@ixKylie moon Riddle for me pls
@kadybat N-DORSE
@kadybat is my ranma 1/2 action/platformer dream going to become a reality???
@cartoonfuntime @burgeroise pipsi i think
@scattermoon @digitales like it sounds like an ironic parody but... you know... it's not

do these people have no sense of irony?
@scattermoon @digitales this sounds like the weird commercials at the beginning of MGS4
@OhMiaGod @actuallyalice moving to san antonio left me so completely broke and in debt ;_;
@actuallyalice @OhMiaGod yeah I hear ya. I just have yet to find a cheap eyeliner i like. All mine suck
@OhMiaGod @actuallyalice its ok I don't actually have any good eyeliner myself :V
@morganastra @FioraAeterna no, similar laws are failing in KY and FL, I don't see it happening in TX. Looks like its just base pandering
@ghost_things sega or the band?
@actuallyalice they're afraid of the notion that social boundaries like 'gender assigmnment' aren't as fixed as they assumed
@OhMiaGod @actuallyalice a good eyeliner is a MUST, cheap eyeliner tends to be particularly awful

worth investing in
@mcclure111 damn shit excellent I WILL BE THERE
@mcclure111 Oh yeah that's a pretty good lineup Discharge is a good band don't know the others but it looks like a great hxc punk/metal show
@qqnosh is that why metroid can't crawl?

metroid was dead all along and this was his nightmare in hell
"protag is dead/dying/dreaming" are the most weaksauce of fan theories stop pushing them
I am literally blushing so hard right now that i'm tearing up oh my god
trans friend to me: "You're pretty inspirational, actually... I hope I can be pretty like you someday..."

I... I... I.. I.. I.. omg 

o///o
@icequeenerika same, +1000
@pinefoxi it's kinda minty too
I really like the taste of pepto

i'm here holding a bottle and i kinda wanna drink it
@qqnosh @ColdmanHot @BeanMM I have fond memories of x5

fond fond memories
@allisonkilkenny idk about that I mean all the trans people I know are "the bomb"
@ShayBlez I keep running into boys and thinking "damn you'd look pretty cute if you transitioned"
oh great San Antonio you're warm for like two weeks and then suddenly bam time to be freezing right when I lose my car and have to walk
@actuallyalice unfortunately there are lots of straight dudes who are eager to jump in bed with trans women... as long as its kept secret
@BootlegGirl @WestCoastAnime There are plenty of gay conservatives out there already, so uhm... yeah.
@actuallyalice this mindset is literally the only way I get things done
@BootlegGirl @tesseractiv fwiw, the ones in KY and FL aren't passing, and if they won't pass it, neither will TX

its just base pandering
@BootlegGirl @Nezchan she'll do it too, she's no stranger to being arrested for trans related protesty things
@BootlegGirl @Nezchan I got a friend talking about paying her a visit now, fwiw

like protesty things I mean
@kadybat fuuuuuuuuuckkkk faaaaaciiiiaaaalllll hhhaaaaaiiiiirrrrrrrr
@fleetfootedfox @SchellAgain especially when said group has made a lot of political gains elsewhere

totally doesn't look reactionary at all
@fleetfootedfox @SchellAgain surely being openly hostile to a marginalized minority group has no chance of backfiring in any way
@SchellAgain @fleetfootedfox Surely this is one of those opportunistic 'play to the base' things and not something that could actually pass?
@SchellAgain @fleetfootedfox I mean all those trans people who've done those horrible things in restrooms I mean

oh wait...
@caitstuff there' s ice in texas??????????
how did Slayers never wind up on Toonami I will never understand this. It would've fit so well, I would've been WAY into it as a kid
@mechapoetic yeah, I get that, trying to inject a bit of levity I guess

apologies if it was inappropriate
@mechapoetic I do that but it's usually a "is this person cool? should I follow back? :o"
hiya puddin' 
nobody *actually* gives a shit about our "biology" it's 100% a smokescreen
I've seen ppl straight up admit that even if our biology was 100% identical to a cis woman's (whatever that means) we'd still not be women
damn y'all sure liked that didn't you?
though really I think it boils down to the same shit behind "no homo"

rampant insecurity
I wish people would just flat out say "accepting that gender assignment can be transcended fucks with my worldview." Its more honest.
weird how nobody gives a fuck about chromosomes or someone's gendered biology until it's time to be a shit to trans folk
@leahvelcro fucking morose people ruining our fun
@leahvelcro @meauxdal My plan is to play live and force drunk people to listen to my garbage
@nerdyjewishgrrl @DrJaneChi if you're affluent, marriage matters, all this stuff about prisons and sex work are poor people problems
@nerdyjewishgrrl @DrJaneChi I mean of course the gay rights movement is geared pretty much entirely for the beneift of the most privileged
you know what nobody has ever said? "This online poll proves it"
@fleetfootedfox I'd say Ace Venture is **far** from 'well meaning' though
@fleetfootedfox but I mean without a lot of these bad and problematic portrayals I wouldn't even know trans was a thing
@fleetfootedfox yeah I guess I mean to say that I'd rather someone attempt and miss the mark at being inclusive than to just... not try
on the flipside, though, I *do* think we should expect better and should hold people accountable for problematic portrayals
Birdo is pretty problematic but I still &lt;3 her
thinking of things like sandman here, the 'well meaning' attempts at representation that still miss the mark and are problematic as heck
probably controversial opinion: I'd rather have problematic queer representation than none at all. A lot of 'bad' stuff was important to me
@ThatSabineGirl so fucking sick of these people treating us like we're just thought experiments. They have NO IDEA how that feels.
@OhMiaGod to be fair, i'm not in that space often, but when I am, WATCH OUT
@OhMiaGod "can't hide the femininity now, might as well embrace it" thing
@OhMiaGod first time wearing a skirt in public was nervous for the first minute, and then suddenly I was overwhelmed with confidence.
@qqnosh WOAH THAT'S TOTALLY SICK BRO GNARLY RADICAL !!!!
@leahvelcro this sounds like the best kind of problem wtf

irritating in jokes are thebest
@janphar @ZJemptv whatever happened to her mad doxxing skillz
@jephjacques what model?
@jephjacques *deals with it and adjusts her playing*

I don't care if it can never be properly intonated!!! it's my noise rock guitar now
@tykat22 @ThatSabineGirl @ZJemptv asktrans has a lot of annoying questions. and other things

idk i lurked it a while. got annoying fast
oh it's 1am

no wonder i'mi so tired
time to grocery

which means

time to salsa
@h34rken yuuuuussss &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

I like you you're cool
@destroyed4com4t @h34rken @tomleger should hire some people to desecrate your own grave after you die
@h34rken I assume you're referring to the band

because the band rules
@SchalaAsha !!!!!!!!!
nooooo leomonnnnnn
@h34rken I have cycled around a bunch but eventually came back to this one

because it's the best

everyone loves it
@YahooAnswersTXT that's how it happened to me
@supercargautier @destroyed4com4t @MariaWNorris tbqh that's like my favorite transphobe thing ever
@Mebrithiel @destroyed4com4t @cyberpunkfetish I've got a friend who's ran into a few "wait you didn't know I was trans? HOW?" moments
@Mebrithiel @destroyed4com4t @cyberpunkfetish lol if I ever go stealth that's how it'll probably happen
@destroyed4com4t @cyberpunkfetish going stealth seems like way more work than it's worth honestly
@h34rken I know that's how my partner got reasonably popular on tumblr

too bad nobody cares about music on social media lol
@SchalaAsha @CrushedGAF @ColdmanHot @ProfessorBeef @imranzomg reminder that 50 shades was literally a twilight fanfic
@ThatSabineGirl I mean that's how it happened to me
@h34rken hrm... can milkshakes work?
@SchalaAsha it's bad... but it also captures the games perfectly

... despite not having any blood or gore

funny that
@h34rken pizza! pizza! pizza!
@SchalaAsha I thought the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie did a fine job. Yes it was horribly cheesy and ultra schlocky, but... so are the games.
@SchalaAsha it's better than most but I still think it misses the mark by quite a bit

(the new witch burning backstory was cringe inducing)
@h34rken &lt;3

My friend's the bass player specifically. She's super cool.

I might've roped her into tracking some stuff for me :3.
@h34rken well it doesn't have the sub angle and its sorta more noiserock-ish but it's so cool


@h34rken i've got a friend with a band that's basically this
@willowhisky plus, you know, the media doesn't demonize trans men as much. 

probably 'cause insecure str8 guys don't have to 'no homo' them
@willowhisky when I first came out and was trying to find info, a HUGE chunk of what I found was about/for/by trans men.
this was absolutely worth re-doing my profile for
"emma you're like
the personification of a fart
and i mean that with utmost affection"
- @hikikomerri
*makes inhuman squeaky noises*
oy one of them I hear some clipping on the vocal track

might have to re-track some things, but that's not really a big deal
found a couple of cover recordings in the VP style i'd done a little bit back 

thinking of re-mixing them and putting them out or something
I thoroughly reject the notion that 'growing up' means eliminating from your person any love of whimsy
@velartrill  I use a lot of those sorts of tics but I'm not trying to bed anyone?

I mean come on I missed out on my own childhood
@OhPoorPup also, "This album would not be notable if it were released today" &lt;-- don't do this

it's silly
@h34rken *nod nod*

in any case if things are getting better I hope they stay that way, and if not I'll stick around anyways &lt;3
@h34rken I guess it doesn't really matter too much, I'm glad that you're getting out of it though
@h34rken seasonal affective, or something else? It's been a really hard past couple of months no matter how you slice it.
@h34rken recently I've noticed that I'm finally able to enjoy sex without having to imagine myself as somebody else.

it's wonderful
@4rkain3 @icequeenerika yeah the people I know who've had it happen weren't trying to induce it, they were just on regular doses and noticed
idk if I get this, but I don't pay much attention to my moods
a friend mentioned to me that she basically did, and it wasn't the first time I'd heard something like that, so I'm really fascinated
Do any trans friends on E experience sorta... regular monthly mood swings? Do you get periods, in other words?
@h34rken Thank you, and you're very welcome. &lt;3
@YahooAnswersTXT @ghost_things
@ImprobableJoe I'd like to filter all instances of "PC" to "Linux"

THE LINUX POLICE.
@hunktears wow what a butthole
@evilgaywitch ooooooohhhhh

yet again I miss a joke
@evilgaywitch ...

I think I'd prefer the guitar pup

I don't like guns
@evilgaywitch the guitar pickup?
@ImprobableJoe the Tony Martin stuff is really nice too &lt;3
80s/90s Black Sabbath is so underrated
If you treat "being trans" as a scandalous thing to "reveal" (and especially if you do it without consent) you're a transphobe. Period.
also the adults in this show are such pushovers
dang giant mecha elephants, always wreckin my motorbikes
so @hikikomerri is watching digimon and a giant mecha elephant is wrecking the city and most people seem to just find this inconvenient
@BootlegGirl metal and nerd culture overlap a lot, and t has similar problems wrt women.

I'd probably have a slightly different take tho
@BootlegGirl @LilithCathcart @bobpoekert ...afaik there's never been an 'appropriately administered government'
also, so far, job has been p cool about trans stuff

they needed my legal name in their system (boo) but they call me 'Emma' and use 'she'
just waiting for a phone call to get my schedule stuff but I basically have a job now

i'm makin pizzas
@spacecoyotl @JeremyCShipp @Seinfeld2000 what's the deal with meatball head?

@ColdmanHot @SchalaAsha @Refyref @qqnosh Malo for smash
@SchalaAsha @qqnosh @Refyref  no no no that baby is the child who is NOT impressed by your antics

psh as if it's hard to press "B"
@qqnosh @SchalaAsha @Refyref GO FISHING,FIND A CAT, GET MONEY, HERD GOATS, IMPRESS CHILDREN
@SchalaAsha @qqnosh @Refyref Many of them are, yeah. 

also Midna &lt;3
@qqnosh @SchalaAsha @Refyref not fond of TP much but SS was pretty ace I'd say

(i just wanted an excuse to post the gif) 
@AmyDentata @hikikomerri she showed it to me

I am deeply confused now
@AmyDentata my girlfriend @hikikomerri pointed at this tweet and just exclaimed BLACK UMBRELLA!

i don't know what she's talking about
how do straight people even like... straight

it sounds so boring
@papierhache ah yeah, and like getting a glipse of anything disgusting, you're suddenly drawn in and can't look away...

so so sorry D:
@papierhache oh god why would you do that

so sorry
@ImprobableJoe oh random boners, I remember those. Been such a long time

'course I never really had them much to begin with, but still
@hikikomerri I didn't quite orgasm but I came close
annoying: getting roped into an argument over something you don't actually care much about
@hitlerpuncher @ami_angelwings wat about choco ice cream w/ choco chips, brownie bits, choco sprinkles, w/choco syrup? Izzat okay??
should I munch on chips before we go eat? might be a while...
great now we're stuck in a waiting room for even longer

i hate the doctor's office
so what i've gathered is that this svu thing manages to piss off and offend pretty much everybody. is that correct?
@kitsunenova oh ranma... "its just a classic comedy manga thats the only reason i like it honest"
@KitsuneNova wonder if I'll watch it and go "ugh if I'd watched this when I was 17  I probably would've just transitioned then"
important question:

should I watch kashimashi?
@AmyDentata I remember it coming out when I was still closeted. Didn't watch it 'cause I thought it'd make me less... closeted or something
@AmyDentata omfg i completely forgot that show was a thing
@PrincessWingy @sophiaphotos kinda the opposite for me. I had a lot of mental blocks pre-transition that prevented me from being as creative
oh looks like I'm making pizzas now
I guess it's like... do I really have a real problem? Is there really something that explains it? 

or am I just some asshole
idk what any of that even means
I asked merri if she thinks I have issues. She cited short attention span, irritability, impatience, impulsivity, and poor money handling
so I wind up feeling like that can't be real, I'm full of shit if I think it is

idk

I just feel like a klutz
I still feel weird talking about bipolar things. 

I can barely remember what happened this morning much less my overall mood over time
@AmSci hi
@S0phieH everyone got locked for that reason

maybe we are all really bots
@auntysarah ah, yeah, me too. I think twitter's having some technical issues or something

happening to lots of people
@auntysarah did they say you were exhibiting 'automated behavior'?
@icequeenerika I understand, but it's hard to make myself stop, it feels so good

I don't remember crashing before, but my memory sucks
twitter u piece of shit
well no it's  more like I feel really energetic and upbeat right now but at the same time I feel sleepy and tired

which is really paradox-y
feeling very hyper energized likeI want to jump around but my body is like "nooooooo just sit here a while" and I wanna scream? and laugh?
@pinetaur YES!!!!
that kinda.... hits close to home
Like that bit in the 1st ep when she's trying to make herself look cute and is staring in the mirror lamenting having neglected her health
Watching Watamote was like trying to watch "Depression, isolation, self-loathing, and social anxiety: the animed comedy"
I tried to watch Watamote and I found it kinda really uncomfortable and depressing and not funny at all.

Protag is way too relateable
@meauxdal curl up, rest, get hugs

I'd give you some hugs in person if I didn't live in a totally different state
@meauxdal I didn't mean to come across as snippy.

I just don't like seeing you beat up on yourself. You don't deserve that.
@meauxdal or you're just consumed with self loathing
@meauxdal and fwiw nothing about you has ever struck me as fraudulent
@meauxdal you might be surprised at how many trans people don't involve themselves with any of that stuff and feel more like you do
@meauxdal my own observation: when you're not in a deep hole or overcome with sadness, you don't really seem to worry about this stuff much
@meauxdal I have no idea what "feeling like a girl" even means.

Depression and despair and seriously distort your self-image.
@meauxdal I wouldn't get too hung up on whether you match other trans experiences. That's always a bad road to go down.
@meauxdal Don't worry about "convincing" them? You're you. Be you, declare it, don't worry about "proving" it 'cause that's not your job.
@meauxdal "fake trans" is a bullshit concept but I sometimes feel that way too
I'm happy about this spidey thing even though I haven't bothered watching any of the phase 2 movies sans IM3 yet

spidey is cool
@hikikomerri @qqnosh @SchalaAsha turns out I've been hallucinating this weird, bad Sonic cartoon my whole life

WHAT A TWIST
@qqnosh @SchalaAsha what do you mean it doesn't exist it even has a page on wikipedia 
@qqnosh @SchalaAsha you mean Sonic Underground isn't the best???
formatting got screwy, i'm the one in the waiting rm. merri is seeing docs
I feel genuinely distraught when I can't be with @hikkikomerri 

sitting in hospital waiting room... alone...
@evilgaywitch but whyyyy straps ruleee

(alternativel, go braless &gt;.&gt;)
I uh

I guess i'm working at a pizza place?

hope my whole uh

being trans thing won't be an issue &gt;.&gt;
@KelestiMMO it is literally time for me to take my hormone dose thx
I'll show pics later
I attempted ombre nails

messy as heck
I just realized that finger-less gloves are popular now because of smartphones.
@LaurakBuzz The faux science is totally wrong but pretty endearing. It's honestly not any worse than your typical anime or 90s sci-fi film.
@mechapoetic at first I read that as "six words" and was like "you're already up to eight! :o"
so hungr
@TransAtheistPod no job here, struggling to find a new one

still don't regret transitioning
everybody is watching this waking dad show I don't get it
@ImprobableJoe I think I mostly listened to random crossover, queercore, grind, etc

fun times
@ImprobableJoe right, yeah

idk i'm tired and distressed
@ImprobableJoe 2014 has been a wild year i don't remember WHAT happened
@ImprobableJoe if lefist surf music or bass driven noise rock won the grammies i'd shit myself
@ImprobableJoe frankly i'd prefer them avoiding those archetypes... they kinda don't make a lot of sense when you think about it anyways
@ImprobableJoe superhero art tends to model itself off of bodybuilders in the case of men and like, pin-up models  in the case of women.
@ImprobableJoe and by 'people i know' I mean a bunch of bands a friend of mine played in.

(it's really really good stuff!)
@ImprobableJoe checking my own library, my 2014 music is uh... Devin Townsend, Cretin, and a ton of shit from people I know (and my stuff)
@ImprobableJoe I am way out of touch too

should we be grammy judges?
@ImprobableJoe They mean that someone convinced a bunch of out of touch judges that they were popular

I hate looking for work

every job I don't get makes the next attempt feel all the more hopeless
@kadybat @destroyed4com4t @dreameaterciel actual transsexual more like actual cannibal
ugh I guess Ihave to apply to fast food now

watch me be overqualified for everything
@BabyWasu LITERALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BRUCE JENNER THING PISSES ME OFF
LRT 

SERIOUSLY
oh hey it me 
@PrincessWingy good good fun times &lt;3
@PrincessWingy how r u
hi


@mcclure111
@tykat22 @destroyed4com4t it's a pair of occasionally funny assholes talking about games

and i do mean assholes

huge assholes
I fucking hate that trans care in the US is so shit that some people are practically forced into DIY.
@fleetfootedfox @heatherpattern P???????????
@velartrill aww it's ok

:)
@ApprovedNews6 nooo I liked it better when it was Texas
@ThatSabineGirl and they think acting threatening over the internet is going to stop that?
@ThatSabineGirl what exactly are they so worked up about anyways?

like I don't even remember
@mcclure111 THIS

I mean maybe with less of the existential thing (idk existance is kinda overrated imo and not super interesting) but YEAH
@ThatSabineGirl Well you can try to opt out, but they have a way of killing you for that.

Then they make sure your death is paid for too
@JFLSarah will do, but I can't promise I won't hit it so hard and so fast that it breaks when I find it.
today is a 'sell shit to pay for medications and phone minutes' day
can there be a magic "fix my life" button?
@auntysarah That's an interesting game console
@snowth Today wasn't super eventful, but what events did happen were like... shitty

yeah

i'm a sad sock 2 day we should have a hug-a-thon
@Loiathal @hikikomerri and this was like from 2013 and she doesn't remember making it and I definitely wasn't around when it happened
@Loiathal @hikikomerri It's Merri acting extremely un-Merri and the way she's acting is rather concerning and disturbing.
I'm a poopy butt.

(take that @hikikomerri )
@KelestiMMO owoah my god
@KelestiMMO yes put on all the meats
*pats on own bladder repeatedly*

yup

yup this sure is making me have to pee
@KelestiMMO is that enouhgh pepperoni?
@ImprobableJoe I hear the smell is very... distinct and kinda drives you batty after a while

ugh I just don't want to be around foooooddd
@ImprobableJoe I assumed this was a given.

I just srsly need a job soon and i'm getting scared and desperate
so I really want to avoid a fast food job because I'm sure that all those deep fryers will be awful for my skin.

Is this petty?
I hate the grind

I just wanna make music and preferably not die

I do just about everything else to facilitate that

fuck the daily grind
@snowth like, I don't have couches to crash on, no place to go, like

it's seriously starting to look like w'ere going to be car sleeping
@snowth I'm honestly really scared. I had a friend pull through to help this month, but next?

I'm all empty now

it's all dried up
@burgeroise the only decent ones I can think of require some creative interpretation
got a call back from the place I interviewed

got a big fat NOPE

why am I so worthless
@ImprobableJoe (I bet I could make an all Devin Townsend playlist about that actually)
@ImprobableJoe a playlist of nothing but songs about water
Good job SwiftKey
I am with you 100% o…
waiting on a job phone call and i'm frozen with fear and anxiety
I know dick about fashion but sometimes it's fun?
I always thought this dress was way too formal for me, but paired with the right kind of accessories and suddenly BAM it works so well
when you start digging in your closet and shit and discover some new outfit combinations that totally rule

&lt;3
I can do like one thing musically and I fall apart when I try to do anything else.

lol.

oh well, at least I have fun
*tries to jam with another musician*

uhm welp here's where I inform you that I'm actually kinda a hack
@ImprobableJoe that's what makes it extra weird for me, my twitter is like, a completely seperate circle from all my other online stuff
@ImprobableJoe people favorite my tweets and reply to me and shit so it's like WOAH
@ImprobableJoe I still have no idea how I have 120+ followers like... what on earth
@hikikomerri we're emotional tornadoes even though I think I tend to think of myself as more goofy than not
it's basically "goofy shit, goofy shit, music stuff, goofy shit, depressed/self loathing rant, goofy shit, goofy shit"
I like to look through my twitter profile sometimes when I get new followers, to kinda check what it looks like.
@JFLSarah &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

srsly though idk i don't think i'm all that awesome at all

but its fun to pretend
@CyberZixx burn them all
@JFLSarah oh don't get me wrong, it's *wonderful*, but you will feel a bit more tossed around emotionally. I did at least
@JFLSarah yup, it's all this constant up and down... and then you start hormones and it gets WILD
@JFLSarah Heh, yeah... had that happen to me recently. Lucky me I wanted to get away from the whole deal anyhow.
@JFLSarah being anxious is totally understandable
@JFLSarah well to be fair, the past year has been the most roller-coastery, emotional, and significant period in my entire life
@JFLSarah blech. Family drama sucks.
@JFLSarah Yup! I wish I had her guts.
@JFLSarah My dad has absolutely no idea. Not sure I really care. kinda curious how he'd react but eh.
@JFLSarah She used to be afraid of standing up to anyone, after all that though? She gives no fucks and will not take your crap.
@JFLSarah My friend came out to everyone recently. Her evangelical family reacted about how you'd expect. It rather emboldened her actually
@JFLSarah that's fair, I mean there's always pros and cons and ultimately I don't know your exact situation.
@JFLSarah I never even came out myself to my extended family, I told my mom, moved away, and she told everyone else
@JFLSarah fwiw i'm a massive weenie and scaredy cat. I remember sending my first coming out email, I could barely click the mouse to send
@JFLSarah Well yeah, thing is that coming out one at a time, reliving those fears over and over, is a lot scarier and more stressful imo
@JFLSarah As in when you're ready, just go all out, rip the bandaid, get it all over with at once, etc.
@JFLSarah apologies for that then, didn't want to make you upset.

idk I'm also fond of the 'just do it' route. Close your eyes, run head on
@JFLSarah the more people you're out to, the easier coming out gets.

but again, that's all up to you
@JFLSarah Like... feel things out, maybe  even come out if it's going okay, just so you have a bit of a baseline to work with or something.
@JFLSarah finding the most trustworthy person from the former group and talk to them. Maybe not come out, but just... a serious talk?
@JFLSarah nah, it's okay, I was busy doing something. 

I know you wanted to wait until HRT, but I might consider...
@JFLSarah Is it a friend group that tends to prioritize that kind of trust and comradery?
@JFLSarah I totally get you there. :( 

Do you have any friends who you think will likely be cool about it?
@JFLSarah Like even if I were cis, would I really want to be friends with someone who considered their trans friend a *freak*?
@JFLSarah I think what I kept telling myself is that anyone who'd reject a friend for being trans isn't a friend I want to begin with.
@JFLSarah idk if they were shocked in a 'good' way, but they were pretty cool about it. Most people don't want to lose their friends.
@JFLSarah We're closer than ever now though.
@JFLSarah it's a LOT more complicated than that, she had issues with her own sexuality and stuff too she was dealing with.
@JFLSarah Some people thought I was joking. Kinda sad about that but I guess I hid it well.
@JFLSarah All of my friends were cishet guys too. All of them were totally shocked when I came out. Even the one who used to think I was gay
@JFLSarah We just avoided talking about it forever. I didn't want to seriously address it, neither did she, so it was never brought up.
@JFLSarah Yeah I didn't 'tell' her per se, she kinda... found out when she stumbled onto some internet things I'd been looking at.
@JFLSarah I always sorta knew that 'sex change' was a 'thing' and that I wanted that, probably heard it from Maury or something
@JFLSarah My girlfriend kinda knew, told me one day she'd be cool with it if I decided to transition. Decided to go for it then.
@JFLSarah Ha, I said I wanted to do it when I was 12. Didn't start or take it seirously until I was 24. Lots of obvious 'signs' looking back
@JFLSarah little tip: if you start getting the "am I *really* trans?" sorts of doubts and worries, remember everyone gets that. It's normal.
@JFLSarah Yusssss. Sexuality is interesting, I'm still not sure how to define mine. I tend to just stick with 'queer'
@JFLSarah Plus I lived hours away from the nearest clinics I could get hormones from, and didn't know when I'd be able to.
@JFLSarah I did the opposite. I was so afraid I'd chicken out, so I came out to people first to sorta give myself accountability.
@JFLSarah Oh yes, finally being able to even say little things like "I never liked being a guy to begin with" is like... such a relief
@JFLSarah I was exactly the same way. Actually coming out was the hardest thing. Getting on HRT was scary too
@JFLSarah eh I think it comes with the territory. I'm a year in, I still won't shut up about it. It's kinda your life for a while at first
@JFLSarah But at the same time, even when you're 100% sure it'll go well, it's still super scary.
@JFLSarah FWIW, the anticipation of doing it is so much scarier than what it actually turns out to be like
@burgeroise I've actually lost a lot of weight i'm pretty sure. I'm definitely smaller.
some girl couples are Sailor Uranus + Neptune

me and @hikikomerri though? We're Mercury and Jupiter.
Got no money riding on this one

GATHER!

FOR IT IS TIME TO EATH PIZZA.
@meauxdal lucky for me I've got pretty bad taste and fairly low standards
@ImprobableJoe Yusssss, and you can dial the tone in with your butt and it pretty much sounds good anywhere
@ImprobableJoe Got a cool bass player friend from the UK playing on the recording i'm doing now, and a real drummer. It's gonna be nice.
@ImprobableJoe also I don't have any recordings of it in that bandcamp link on my profile... yet.

Hopefully in a couple of months though
@ImprobableJoe aww dang. It's an amp worth getting, for sure. 

now if only I had a nice bass amp to go with it lol
@ImprobableJoe It was kinda hard to find, snagged it off of ebay several years ago, a bunch of 90s DM bands I was into used to use these
@ImprobableJoe I've got an Ampeg VH140C. Combo, but still loud as hell. Solid State but it's a genuinely nice one. Great and distinct tone.
@ImprobableJoe I can do that too... &gt;.&gt;  Gotta be really well rehearsed though. I kinda like doing everything tho, wanting to pick up drums
@ImprobableJoe It's all learnable. Can be painful figuring out the proper technique though. TBQH it helped a lot with trans voice stuff
@ImprobableJoe if only I could do real singing on top of the punky shouts and death metal growls I can already do well
@ImprobableJoe I'm just really not fond of ghost pepper flavor, so I just overload on habaneros and stuff instead
@ImprobableJoe make homemade salsas? Just dump like 10 or so habaneros in and you'll have a mighty spicy salsa
I know I tried to turn my guitar amp loud enough to match my unamp'd vocals once and it got kinda inappropriately loud for an apartment
Been rehearsing guitar stuff a lot lately, but I've not done anything with my vocals.

I'm nervous about annoying neighbors.

I'm very loud.
@mintchipleaf even better, it's an apartment, so i'm certainly annoying my neighbors.

also my turntable is in here so there's that too
@mintchipleaf I perform my own stuff here in the living room 'cause i'm rehearsing does that count?
@hikikomerri It was quite an experience...
@0xabad1dea He could've sold all the pro monitors to hardcore retro game nerds
today I noticed something about my figure in the mirror

HIPS

DEM HIPS

I GOTS DEM HIPS!!!!!
we're called "small queer birds"
"everyone in this show is really queer and really stup…
@hikikomerri YES AND I LOVE IT
I have good friends
@NemoWoodbine I'm not sure Ayn Rand would appreciate being in a world with free healthcare like that
@stavvers HOW IS HE SO BAD AT TWITTER
i'm kinda really hungry

I can m ake another batch of salsa but do I really want salsa on an empty stomach?
Seki kun is the most wonderful thing
What is this eco-friendly crap I bet Rumi shops at Whole Foods 
*stomps around like a big marching robot destroying a city*
I came home and just... died. Collapsed in my bed, didn't wake up until like now

full 8 hours of sleep though
@ImprobableJoe good excellent point

my brain is kinda a puddle most of the time
@ImprobableJoe (what's up with the question mark?)
@ImprobableJoe My girlfriend just indicated to me that saying it "hasn't caused any problems" is kinda... completely, utterly wrong?
@ImprobableJoe but I mean... it wouldn't be the first thing that I was in denial about the negative effects of. 

*cough dysphoria*
@ImprobableJoe I guess I also find myself like... "What do you mean? This hasn't caused any problems for me at all"

idk
@ImprobableJoe only reason I dont' have a diagnosis is 'cause the therapist wasn't licensed for it, but she DOES run bipolar groups and such
....yeah i'm starting to think the therapist that said I'm likely Bipolar II might be onto something
"I don't have any kind of manic/hypomanic state"

*spends a few days spinning around, flailing about, talking fast, and feeling elated*
"I can't be bipolar, I don't have depressive episodes."

*doesn't leave house for a week*
job interview timeee!
yet another unrealistic standard of beauty #meninist 
@ThatSabineGirl I wanted to get Shantae on my game boy when that came out, didn't want to get mocked for playing a game starring a girl.
@ThatSabineGirl for me it was more everybody else. Other kids, cousins, etc. I didn't want to be made fun of or excluded, and yeah...
@ThatSabineGirl my parents would've probably bought me stuff if I pushed them, but even asking for a fluffy pink pillow once got me teased
@mcclure111 oh that is neat. i was expecting it to be like, all the tetris pieces fit together in this pattern that covered the whole leg
@mcclure111 I want tetris socks D:
is it okay to cry if the reasons you're crying are silly and ridiculous?
people who ban evade are weird
why would I want to be in a place where I've been told I'm unwelcome?
I feel weird that I was actually straight up banned. Like... idk it's unnecessary. It's not like i'm gonna force my way back.
crybox time

even if i do feel ridiculous
but it still hurts anyways

it hurts a lot
and I feel like a fucking idiot, i'm crying over an IRC channel, and one in which most of the ppl I like I talk to outside of it anyways
I thought this was supposed to make me better...

I just don't understand
I'd never been banned from a community pre-transition. Never even had a warn or were told there were any issues at all. Now? Happened twice.
I feel like i've been becoming a better and more true-to-myself person over the past year. So why do people seem to hate me more?
I'd be more casual if I didn't find it all so hurtful
totally what I needed tonight, I mean it's not like I need to sleep becaue of a job interview or anything
it's fun getting banned from a community and not told why

fun fun
Although Yoshi is usually referred to with 'he' pronouns, he lays eggs.

@ShayBlez Yeah, I was angry and upset yesterday. Said I kinda felt like I wanted to cry. My friend just said "Cry" so I did. I cried a lot.
woah 6 months into HRT and I seem to FINALLY have my crybox turned on

neato.
big ass scorpions? huge spiders? no problem. 

giant fucking fist sized bees? OH FUCK NO FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
@BootlegGirl had something like this happen yesterday, ran into someone I hadn't talked to in AGES, did a bunch of catching up
MLP and metal go together like guacamole and frosted flakes @fleetfootedfox


...surprised there aren't more
@ThatSabineGirl That's how it is with me and vinyl. Tends to be more expensive and requires more care, so I end up only getting true favs
@ThatSabineGirl I also collected retro games for years though, got sick of that whole 'scene' so I'm kinda iffy on owning tons of media
@ThatSabineGirl I recently purged my blu ray collection (needed money), but still have a lot of DVDs. It was kinda freeing, less "stuff."
@ThatSabineGirl In terms of cost, though, Netflix is definitely the best option.
@ThatSabineGirl Netflix has a nice lineup and they add new things often. There's something to be said about owning discs though, yeah.
@hikikomerri DIPPING YOUR HANDS INTO THAT WOULD NOT BE SMART
oh wow that's right that pic was the first time i've publically shown my face on twitter
(yeah that's the 3DS camera, I couldn't find my otehr one.)
wow I look decent without makeup for once 
@hikikomerri WELL I HAVE TO BE PURDLY DON'T I?
me "OKAY TODAY I'M TAKNIG SELFIES"

*takes a shower*

*sits in living room*

"UGH I'M TOO SLEEPY NOW"
@ametur_poet you don't owe your mom an audience, she can either try to talk to you in a nonthreatening way or she can not talk to you at all
@PixelScum thank youuuu, i've been in panic mode all day worrying about her
@PixelScum this post here, please? My friend could use the support.


boost a bit too maybe if you can? I want my friend to know that she's loved and that it's going to be okay
my friend @ametur_poet has got some really scary things happening and I need people to show support. Transphobic family.
@mirell they haven't quite figured out what the other 3 letters besides "G" in "LGBT" are yet


OMFG
my friend's about to post a coming out letter and is super nervous 

I want everyone to send magic good feelies or something ok?
I have 123 followers

and 2,555 tweets (or well, I did, before making this one)

haha

numbers
@Sailor_Moon_CA @hikikomerri ah, yeah, lots o' nostalgia for that version of the show
@Sailor_Moon_CA @hikikomerri is the Canada version the same thing as the one that aired in the US?
@ametur_poet you're not doing anything wrong by breaking a promised you were coerced into making in the first place
@ametur_poet it's an unethical promise to force somebody to make in the first place.
it's not DBZ levels of padding thankfully but

idk I don't have time for this
*sits down with @hikikomerri to watch Sailor Moon*

*notices its like 8 eps before Mercury appears*

wow uhm that's a lot of padding
@destroyed4com4t @Terminator_8464 @ChloeSagal me too, just never when I need it!
@Terminator_8464 @destroyed4com4t @ChloeSagal I keep meaning to save this image when I see it but ugh twitter's gif system is ridic
@EmmaQuack NO PORN THOUGH
I want to get a webcam sometime and have fun webcam chats with friends
@ametur_poet That's probably wise, though I'd imagine there'd be a lot of relief in just ripping the bandaid and getting it over with now
@ametur_poet just breathe
you'll be okay
@BookishMatt @christinelove what a horrible night to have a curse
I had an awful time sorta dealing with my past today

then i met a cool new friend

A+!
@datacicada @leahvelcro *prepares to get jealous and sad* :)
@datacicada @leahvelcro yes I think we can all see that you've had some growth
The strangest feeling is that I can't think of 'old me' and 'me' as the same person, and that I dissociate with him to such an extreme...
@OhMiaGod I think I might appreciate that
I just can't stop thinking of how much I hate him. I feel obsessed and overwhelmed and incoherent right now. I'm sorry. @OhMiaGod
I cried over this just now. A lot. Had these violent visions of hurting him. I just can't stop. I just kept crying... @OhMiaGod
Never understood me, never wanted to just let me be, just freaked out and hid me and kept me a prisoner. That's why I hate him @OhMiaGod
I... view him as my prisoner. He hid me and locked me away 'cause he was a coward and tried to make sure nobody knew @OhMiaGod
@OhMiaGod I guess I've always felt like my feelings and thoughts are too incoherent for a blog.
@OhMiaGod idk, I use twitter for thoughtdumps a lot, I use IRC sometimes and vent to some poor sap.
Even right now, I have trouble actually bringing myself to acknowledge that we're the same person. I hate old me that much. @OhMiaGod
@OhMiaGod I didn't recognize that I hated old me this much until now, I didn't think about it before. I don't know what to make of it.
@OhMiaGod old me postured and faked things a lot to hide insecurities. I don't think he deserves this hate, but I can't help but feel it
@leahvelcro COME ON THIS WAS AWESOME FOR ME YOU SHOULD DO IT ITS AMAZING AND FULFILLING AND YOU'LL FEEL SO AWESOMEEEEE! OO IT NOW!!!
@leahvelcro I'm the worst person to talk to about general gender feels lol. I just try and convince EVERYONE to transition lmao
@leahvelcro 4 times so far, though one of them was someone who came to me (though we knew each other before.)
The amount of intense hatred I have for old me is kinda alarming... I'm just seething with rage about it. 

I don't know why
@leahvelcro well, specifically, it's been straight up "oh i'm wanting to transition actually" kind of stuff, not just 'im uncomfortable'
it's not that he ever did anything particularly awful, he was just so... fake. In so many ways. I just fuckin' hate him. HATE him.
I just... hate that person, with a ridiculous passion, and it sorta feels silly how much outright contempt I hold for him.
Today I learned that I hold the utmost contempt and loathing for the person I used to be.

I'm relieved that he's gone, he was a fuckhead
@BootlegGirl its the posturing and insecurities more than the awk nerd that'd keep me away 

I kinda hate old me actually...
@BootlegGirl Ew me pre-transition was an awkward, posturing nerd who constantly hid their insecurities behind feigned hobby interests
maybe I've unkowingly developed closeted transdar!! :o
Maybe I just pick up on 'dudes' who seem to subtly eschew a lot of / seem somewhat awkward with masculine roles?

*shrugs*
@ColdmanHot Birdo is my trans mascot

I have been seriously contemplating a Birdo tattoo

she's cool af
Come out to as cis person as trans 'cause they seem cool...

"Oh yeah I've kinda had gender issues for a long time..."

THIS KEEPS HAPPENING
@willowhisky most are a dark, nearly black plum color, and my middle finger on my right hand is a bright red
@willowhisky I need to touch up mine, they're starting to chip a bit

...or you know, I need to get a clearcoat
@willowhisky painting nails?
@meauxdal i'd probably be apologizing for winning so much :(
@meauxdal I keep running this scene through my head and I can't not imagine you basically being the most badass person ever
@auntysarah AFTA lol
@rvedotrc 'twas eating cookies and milk but it MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN.

THE FOREFRONT OF GENCRIT THOUGHT FOLX
@auntysarah why am I even trying to parse this logic, I've done it before it's never a good idea.

*headbonks wall*
@rvedotrc OH COME OH WHAT DO THEY EVEN TRY?
@auntysarah ....so I take it they don't care that MRA is an actual thing and that many of them hate us too?
@auntysarah I'm still confused about the MRA thing.

Do they not know what MRAs are?
@willowhisky I've never had any idea what was going on. Everything I say is basically an educated guess about it.
@AmyDentata they care about the harassers enough to give them a platform, apparently
@meauxdal or oh, a way I've heard it put: Your experiences, skill, etc 'clue you in' to the music around you that wants to be written
@meauxdal this really speaks to me for some reason, I like it.
@meauxdal I've known a lot of artists who feel similarly about their music actually.
@AikoChanIsAwsum incredible...
@AikoChanIsAwsum but what if I want to suffer?
@AikoChanIsAwsum idk i'm paranoid, can I just be given the infinite ingredients and a nice blender and make it myself?
@AikoChanIsAwsum infinite... salsa? like specifically the homemade salsa I make for myself? That I eat until I get sick or run out of chips?
@AikoChanIsAwsum does this mean if I *do* follow you I get to be in heaven???

is being in heaven actually a good thing???
I've had a lot of people telling me i'm "cool" and other positive things and I'm honestly a little taken aback by it

blushing hardcore tho
@meauxdal *hugs* etc. I wish I could offer you more. I've seen you in a better place before, I know you can get there again.
@mcclure111 I miss single player Phantasy Star ;_;
@ImprobableJoe I mean all that trouble to get it out of the body just to put it back in...
@ImprobableJoe you should not eat fetus

unless it's like... chicken fetus

but eggs are usually unfertilized

so they aren't fetuses

STILL
I like you you're pretty cool
@willowhisky @HelenBronston @karenfobaren I feel worst when I'm already stressed about something else. Stress becomes a dysphoria bomb.
@willowhisky @HelenBronston @BootlegGirl @alysoncmcmanus Ha, I did the same thing with so many games. Played as girl &gt; get paranoid &gt; stop
TOTALLY. WORTH IT.
as in like "I GOTTA DO THE THING" and the thing scares me and I make myself do it anyways while crying and panicking the entire time
Also I am a weenie who's scared of changing things, rocking boats too much, etc. Thus this entire past year has been a nonstop case of AAAAH
new followers: I talk a lot about BS. Food. Silly stuff. Sometimes I rant about things or I nerd ramble. Sometimes I'm sad. I hope you enjoy
hoooooooly shit I wake up with tons of new followers and a ton of notifications

woah fuck
@BootlegGirl I remember wanting to transition at 12. Then I went into denial until I was 24. All 'cause I was scared of being trans.
@BootlegGirl ...actually it probably would've scared the fucking hell out of me
@BootlegGirl That was nice and I related a lot. 

I can't imagine how I would've reacted if I read something like that when I was say, 16
@meauxdal anyways I'm never going to use the phrases "Beep Boop Into the Grave"
or "Electric Skillet Pie" so if those give you ideas...
@meauxdal Maybe since they aren't your normal subject, that's all the more reason to do it? :3

I'm just seeing if I can get gears turning.
@meauxdal this does not preclude them from being inspired by these things
@meauxdal alternatively something inspired entirely by weird sexts
@meauxdal A concept album about Richard Dawkens making an ass of himself
@fleetfootedfox oh what
@meauxdal I really hope this comes together for you somehow. I know what it feels like to have everything seem to just go wrong at once. :(
@meauxdal well fuck that god then

what a dick
@meauxdal wait... the insurance thing....

FUCK I lost my insurance in November D:
@meauxdal mm, true. I just don't trust Paypal very much.
@meauxdal can't have them mail you a check to just cash somewhere?
@meauxdal and naturally it's so ubiquitous that you p. much  HAVE to use it for some services and transitions
mmmm just talking about my homemade salsa is making me feel a bit better.
only caveat is that it settles when stored. ya gotta shake it up. I dont like my salsa chunky so sometimes i just put it back in the blender
its a fresh salsa. i've cooked it before, but i prefer it uncooked. lots of peppers and cilantroooo :D
homemade salsa is like my fave snack. my recipe is cheap and easy too...
i still have some salsa left.... and i found more chips.......
im going to eat like 200 onions
@pixelscum pizza has helped before... nuggets sound good...
I want to cry, but I need to laugh.
I am a miserable depressed puddle today. Any suggestions? Comfort foods?
Im a miserable depressed puddle today. Anybody have any suggestions? Comfort foods?
I AM SAPIOSEXUAL YAP YAP. 
I ONLY DATE SMART PEOPLE LIKE ME.

*grinds up a Richard Dawkins book and snorts it*
@ixKylie @washingtonpost but where are they gonna find one of those? It's not like there's millions of photos of trans women everywhere...
My vocals are pretty loud and I'm basically screaming at the top of my lungs, drums can't be THAT much more annoying can they? &gt;: )
I'm kinda planning to get a drum kit once I'm back on my feet.

...in an apartment
@ImprobableJoe Dominos order form will let you order up to 25 at once... per pizza.. idk if they'll actually take that order though
@ImprobableJoe idk I'm not sure most places will take such a large order on short notice...
I think pizza is my comfort food

I was super depressed, got me a pizza, now i'm giggling about shit

pizza is magic y'all
A NIGHT I WILL NEVER FORGET
Also yes the guitarist totally did the hand over the fretboard instad of under it thing. Arpeggios all day long. Such a showoff.
oh and the bass player crabwalked the whole time.
But then he pulls out a keyboard. Starts playing kb leads w one hand while tapping guitar with the other hand doing harmonies. I was DYING.
He's up there in a Wintersun shirt and has a fan on stage so he can step in front of it during his fancy shreddy solos and look all DRAMATIC
A huge bunch of dorks, but the highlight was their guitarist, who was the biggest guitar dork I've ever seen, it was glorious
oh right I didn't share this with twitter, but a few weeks ago I went to see a friend's band. Her show was fun, but the NEXT band, oh wow &gt;
I think the fact that I never seem to knock them out of tune is a testament to them being quality guitars
I keep knocking my guitars over I *seriously* need some guitar stands.
@ImprobableJoe @destroyed4com4t done! :D

now the question is how FAST can you play it?

*ouch ouch sorry*
@ImprobableJoe @destroyed4com4t (I don't know what we're doing at this point)
@ImprobableJoe @destroyed4com4t my bass lines are so low that you need like, acoustic research facilities to reproduce the sound
@vivian_games they got me on 10mg, which feels completely ridiculous but my body does NOT seem to want to take in E :P
@vivian_games try and get some lab work done, check your levels, etc. Bump accordingly.blah blah
@vivian_games really they just left you o 2mg? I don't I know anyone who is that low, most ppl I know get bumped to 4 at least. 

YMMV etc
@vivian_games how much do they have you on out of curiosity?
@ImprobableJoe @destroyed4com4t *tunes to G# out of spite*
@meauxdal and frankly I think you're awesome. I wish you wouldn't hate yourself so much, but I understand that's easier said than done
@meauxdal tbqh those are both pretty awesome things to be good at. You're an artist. That means a lot to some people.
@meauxdal nah, it just means that right now at this point in your life you're dealing with different needs and priorities
@meauxdal You're quite lovable, I can assure you.
@meauxdal seems like your big issue is simply that you just want a companion bad enough that you're willing to even trade your gender for it
@meauxdal What I'm saying is that the sorts of thoughts and feelings you're having are totally normal, and none of it invalidates you.
@meauxdal I mean in my case, the fact that i'm actually doing this kinda freaks me out sometimes.
@meauxdal Eh, I get that. Especially if being out didn't quite bring what you hoped it would. 

I get anxious 'bout various things
@meauxdal or as my partner once put it (sorta): "If not being a girl makes you sad then be a girl"
@meauxdal I don't really feel like one needs to 'justify' your gender. If you feel better thinking of yourself as a girl, well... seems obv
@meauxdal being "disgusted with yourself sexually" is kinda pretty textbook dysphoria &gt;.&gt;
@meauxdal I don't believe it makes you 'fraudulent' at all
@meauxdal fwiw, I have no idea what it means to "feel like a girl" and a lot of that sort of language has always puzzled me.tbqh
like it was LOUD and very distinctly NOT a firecracker
OKAY I AM LIKE 90% SURE I JUST HEARD A FUCKING GUNSHOT 

HOLY FUCK
@BootlegGirl @tykat22 Yeah, I can def believe that a LOT of atheists have no clue what the fuck they're talking about wrt trans issues.
@BootlegGirl @tykat22 you gotta have a fundamentally wrong understanding of what trans even is to make an argument like that
*starts eyeballing DVD box sets, cds, and vinyl*
I felt a lot better after selling that game collection. Kinda freeing.

sold off most of my blu rays the other day, that felt p. freeing too
@ametur_poet
I also remember using fedora for a while on another machine was waiting on a repair disc.

I had no idea what I was doing
@ametur_poet I did something like this once with Puppy. I had an old, shitty Win ME PC.

Win XP ended up running better on it tbqh.
I mean I'm crass and I swear a lot. I think maybe it's 'cause I take a lot after my mom and aunt. They were pretty crass too.
*burps loudly*
Realization: somewhat ironically, I'm far more comfortable being "unladylike" as a woman than I ever was as a man.
oh one time i played NFL blitz and I think there was ballkicking in that @qqnosh
what even is football

i don't get it
LRT: Idk that I'd just straight up describe myself as gay but nonetheless

yes pls

pizza pls

I like pizza.

Coincidence? Nah, I'm gay. :3
also making sure my mixes this time actually work in mono... or I at least keep mono versions of certain songs on hand just in case... &gt;.&gt;
anyways yeah blah blah blows the old stuff out of the water etc. I'm really proud of the songs thus far, can't wait to record
Any SATX drummers wanna play some crossover-y stuff w/ me? :D
Only downside is the drummer and bass player are remote.

Hopefully I can find some local peeps to play live with though.
The redone old songs have various tweaks, some minor, some major, new parts, etc. At least one is almost completely different
new violent pastels thing is happening now, song all written, some rerecordings

real drums this time

way more aggressive than before
maybe one of these days I'll use an actual picture of me

still kinda nervous about uploading photos in a public space tho

i'll get over it
@ShayBlez yussss :)

My first avatar here was Excel. Different picture though.
yes i'm assuming you care about things like me getting a new avatar

if you didn't, why would you follow me?
hi

new avatar thingy

fun
@coryshwadlenak @waifu_txt like... Excel Saga Excel?
i've put on my glasses to help me find my glasses before
I was looking for my keyboard

one of the places I looked was under my keyboard

how
^lets bring this name back again

i liked this name
@AtlasSmugged @BootlegGirl idk also frankly the idea of gendering demeanor to begin with feels iffy to me.
@AtlasSmugged @BootlegGirl It's kinda bs considering my own minor abraisive streak is something I took after my mother.
so I've been unemployed for nearly two months now

I hope it ends soon

I'm getting really bored
@PixelScum @Galateid Iced Earth are so bad wow

(I have an old picture of me in a Horror Show shirt :( )
@destroyed4com4t San Antonio's actually a lot better than Austin when it comes to trans resources imo.
@lljktechnogeek @FakeRobotGamer @samusclone @vex0rian It was the PETA episode, I got a bit mixed up.

Still.
@samusclone @FakeRobotGamer @vex0rian The PETA one, right. Lot's of "you're right... but not for the reasons you're trying to use"
@FakeRobotGamer @samusclone @vex0rian I remember they got Ted fucking Nugent to talk about how veganism sucks. Ted Nugent. For anything. Um.
so I discovered that craigslist has forums....

wow what an awful place
I'm gonna drink an entire can of butter-da
@leahvelcro much like with westboro, it allows people to say "no, we aren't transphobic, now THOSE people are transphobic!"
@leahvelcro to be fair there, I've known a LOT of people with pretty gross parents like that, but yeah.
@pansgrrl @destroyed4com4t what the fuck is the online trans community
pizza buffets rule
3ds browser is weak sauce
when i came out i thought id never present in public. now less than 1yr later i wear skirts to metal shows
i hate the doctor's office
@christinelove as a texas gal: 60F is too cold
@fleetfootedfox oh and naturally, if you complain about this you're just wanting to use your illness as an excuse too
@ThatSabineGirl you kept me around &lt;3
@fleetfootedfox it's basically saying "if you can't act 'pleasant' due to your illness it's your own fault."
@fleetfootedfox &gt; you're almost expected to just will away your symptoms and treated as if you have the same 'filters' as everyone else
@fleetfootedfox yeah it's like, if you're a 'less desirable' neuroatypical (aka one who's symptoms cause you to "be an asshole") &gt;
so does anyone else find the whole "Just because someone is mentally ill doesn't excuse them being an asshole!" thing to be kinda sketchy?
@leahvelcro 'course i'm kinda freaking out

but that's just how I am I suppose
why I was fiddling with my pillminder in the first place I dont even know
well crap all of my E I had left was in my pillminder and I completely misplaced my pillminder
@KelestiMMO I was gonna call a staffing agency, I was gonna try to write some music, and then I just crashed on my bed
me: "ah okay i should do this and this and this"

me: *literally sleeps all day*
@meauxdal a good friend of mine (the one who got me into Devin Townsend actually) was a fan of Tim Hecker. Memoriesssss
mentioned to a queer friend that we were eating tacos tonight

you can guess where she took that one
@DrPalutena fear of trolleys
picking my nose

idgaf it feels so nice to get that shit out
@jaythenerdkid I once got added to a shitty passive aggressive list like that and i'm still not sure why
@SchalaAsha @ColdmanHot I find the opposite "HOW DARE YOU LIKE THIS THING I DON'T LIKE" to be even more fascinating
@ColdmanHot I think that nerds can't function unless their taste in things is validated.
@BootlegGirl @JlnFrancisco 'cause there seems to be a lot of symptom overlap between ADHD and being in a hypomanic state
@BootlegGirl @JlnFrancisco I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, though recently i've learned i might be bipolar II. Wonder how hypomania fits
@BootlegGirl @Spacekatgal :)
@BootlegGirl @Spacekatgal my personal interpretation is that Catherine is about how cis ppl suck 'cause Erica's the only decent person.
@profanegeometry I'd totally join!
@ametur_poet back home it's all ice storming

4 hours south, here, it's 41F and might rain, maybe


handy
@burgeroise or can I *count* Kirby as an action game?

(found!? really? I typed "found!?")
@burgeroise can I found Kirby as an action game???
@joeyalison I read the "just so you know" stuff not long after coming out, and it helped make things a tad less stressful for me. thanks.
I find that getting your blood drawn calms you down pretty quick
it's p much the end of 2014

I don't remember what the fuck has happened and don't even know what's happening right now

can you call back?
@burgeroise wow I'm glad I totally missed whatever shitstorm happened. 

I love the comic.
@PixelScum golly *blush*
I mean it's not even THAT bad I do have internet access after all.
how the fuck do I hve 113 followers there can't possibly be that many of you who are interested in me complaining about how much my life sux
@leahvelcro but then i'll have to put my pants on
I project so hardcore and assume that basically  everyone is really closet trans

is this bad?
@emitans ever read these? 

not a lot there but it's cute
I like twitter because it allows me to basically make the text equivalent of shitting in a blender on a per-post basis
@emitans o I never read it... I thought it'd just make me sad

same reason i never saw Wandering Son
@emitans THIS IS WHY I AVOID MOST TRANS WEBCOMICS

WHY ARE THEY ALL SAD

why can't they be cute/happy/affirming???
When I get a phone call and it's someone asking for "Mr. [oldname]" 
@emitans I read up to what seems to be the last page so far

I liked it

Fi's adorable
@emitans what is this I like the art
@emitans I assume any game with a trans character handles it poorly. Heck even the "good" ones often hinge on generous interpretations, etc
@emitans were there any games this year that handled transgender folks at all?
I am seriously sitting here trying to think up ways to get a free pizza right now

I really really REALLY want a pizza
a-one

a-two

a-one, two, one, two
woohoo one more old guy shirt hacked into a ragged, flattering tank
@actualjellyfish I'm definitely leaning towards that it is.
@SloaneRisette @emitans not sure whether i count in this but I am faving anyways because friends are &lt;3
i'm no artist i'm a fartist
mmmmm merri whipped up this delicious chicken and onion cream rice concoctio and it was wonderful
so i'm waiting for @hikikomerri to finish her mysterious wizard food skills
@christinelove same
@AmyDentata That this even needs to be said is extremely alarming.
@AmyDentata @jetta_rae "transgenders"
@emitans ...wow

:(
o my it's 1am

when did this happen

no wonder I feel sleepy
(I had a more eloquent way of wording my point here but I completely forgot it when I started making the tweet.)
Alternatively: If I sound like i'm full of shit, I probably am. 

But I'll figure it out eventually.
if there's 1 thing about me I want ppl to realize, it's that everything I say is tentative. 
I rarely actually know what i'm talking about.
@leahvelcro I mean i'm also into poop jokes so take what I say with a grain of salt and don't look TOO much into it

i might be full of it
@leahvelcro but like, yeah, you kinda need a sense of what kind of piece you are before you can find the place you fit.

something like that
@leahvelcro (not to say these steps are mututally exclusive or that there's a clear distincton when one begins or the other ends, of course)
@leahvelcro yeah, it's like, there's figuring out who you are, and then there's figuring out where you belong.
@leahvelcro but once your shit is finally together, it takes a back seat and you can focus on other things. I dont think you should feel bad
@leahvelcro ya know I get the sense that every trans person has this experience of their own transition being a huge obsession at first
hrmmmmmm do I share a picture of myself on here or no?

debating it.....
@DrPalutena +100,000,000 to you so much
I keep seeing LGBT and my brain keeps thinking "Lettuce, Gay, Bisexual, Tomato"

maybe i just compare myself too readily to food?????
@leahvelcro i've only started using 'ya'll' a lot this past year

should totally throw around more 'howdy's' 'fixin to's and 'darn tootin's
@tykat22 this is good yes great super yes everything i want in a joke

good job
Christmas Ib
@jamiekilstein whether you're gay has nothing to do with how much sex you have, but yeah, it's bullshit.
@psdevin crap they've found us out
@netcrusher88 excuse me while I vomit all this ramen i'm eating right now
I like the word "shenanigans"
@SmartAssJen what's a video game?
@Shufflejoy *also feels this* :(
I agree, @butt_things.
how'd he manage to not listen to me at all when talking about bipolar stuff and seeming to have barely a clue about what bipolar even is?
how did he seriously not know that ADHD meds can cause depression? how did he manage to not know what HRT was?
ya'll have my notes, ya'll have my preferred name, most ppl at this place are fine with it, why was this old fuck psych having trouble?
"you don't seem hypomanic you seem kinda shy"

could it be because you called my old name repeatedly in the waiting room???
@actualjellyfish but even then, like my 'neutral' or 'baseline' or whatever was elevated, I felt happier more often, in a genuine way
@actualjellyfish I thought I couldn't be depressed because I was so often upbeat... then I found out I'm likely bipolar and it was like "oh"
@actualjellyfish I think I was not actually realizing how bad things were until they started getting better. I didn't notice at first.
@actualjellyfish coming out: being honest with myself like that helped me connect more. 

HRT helped push that way further
@HelenBronston thanks a lot for the info, and yeah I completely, 100% agree.
@HelenBronston I keep seeing this stuff and I don't even know who this person is that they're talking about.

it still bugs me
@HelenBronston yeah this past year has been by far the most significant time of my life. Everything is rushing forward, its pretty neat.
@burgeroise @DrPalutena a lot of the whole "moe" thing is just infantilizing characters. It really bothered me trying to watch K-On
@bunydoll I'd totally suggest cool things to do/see if I'd lived here longer
@bunydoll woah ur in the city I am in now that's wild
oh hey i'm 5 months HRT today

also 3 months in SATX

also one month unemployed
bored today so i'm trying to learn how to play slap bass

am i funk? am i funk yet?
@latentexistence sad that my first thought is "well at least they asked"
@BootlegGirl I literally have no clue what 'good taste in modern mainstream rock' is supposed to be

no clue at all
@BootlegGirl 'course the real reason is that rock's always been a bit of a boy's club. 

That's slowly changing thankfully
@CyberZixx honestly all signs point to things being fine, this person is just slow to reply 'cause they have a life and i'm a panicky butt
@CyberZixx Glad i'm not alone! I just so want this thing to happen and the slightest hint of it not happening puts me in panic mode
LRT: for you @hikikomerri
but my brain doesn't want to jump to that, instead it jumps to "OH NO I FUCKED UP SOMEHOW AND NOW THEY HATE ME AND WE'LL NEVER TALK AGAIN."
they probably just haven't checked their email yet, or got busy with other things, or this or that or who knows

maybe they share a computer
I get all "OH NO MAYBE I SCARED THEM!!! D:" so easily, idk how to stop it. I know it's unlikely but yeah.
email correspondence with a cool person

it's probably not normal to freak out and get paranoid if you don't hear back right away
singing Motorhead's "Overkill" feels so appropriate for doing this

"ONLY WAY TO FEEL THE NOISE IS WHEN IT'S GOOD AND LOUD!"
am I really THAT loud? 

woah
practicing guitaring and singing at the same time. The volume i have to turn my guitar amp to keep up with my voice is suprising
@leahvelcro ugh yeah the way that shit progressively eats into you :(
I am being flippant about this but uhm... yeah

no income, kinda a bad situation

I'll figure this out though. 

Probably.
current bank balance:
-$686.89

holy shit lol

I am so fucked
I keep confusing adjectives and verbs
(it was a Newton's cradle fwiw)
I googled "the ball tacky swing back and forth thingy" 'cause I couldn't remember what that was.

Google gave me the right answer

*claps*
yes I know Znöwhite isn't NWOBHM

and no I'm not going to consistently use the umulaut when I type that
...actually no it's more NWOBHM I guess

makes em think of things like Znöwhite

Znöwhite rules btw
my name is so hair metal now
@darrylayo @potatofarmgirl Dangerous too. I know people who thought they weren't "serious enough artists" because they didn't "risk it all."
@BootlegGirl if you're poor, you'd better make damn sure you're reminded of that every day. Otherwise you just aren't trying.
@BootlegGirl the expect you to only own what's absolutely necessary for basic survival. 4 walls and a bed, everything else is 'wasteful'
@BootlegGirl they DEPEND on people like me, they want to take us and wring us for everything they can. They know we have no other choice.
@BootlegGirl @bobpoekert yeah, honestly it's one of my 'last resort' backup plans if I can't get working again soon, still, it's a temp fix
@BootlegGirl @bobpoekert ...but I also know I wouldn't be able to pay it back
@BootlegGirl @bobpoekert I'm unemployed and already in huge debt, I've thought about payday loans. I figure my credit already sucks so...
LIKE SERIOUSLY JUST COINCIDENTALLY RUNNING INTO A TRANS DRUMMER ON CRAIGSLIST LIKE HOLY SHIT THIS IS COOL

we're meeting up soon CAN'T WAIT
I think I just found a trans drummer to start a probably metalpunk band

this rules
why'd I sit here reading a lengthy 70s fem anti trans bs comment

now i'm all worked up for no good reason

dammit
I'm not as good at this as @hikikomerri clearly
sext: prepare your finest gag reflex
looking at cheesy 1950s documentaries so I can take weird samples out of context
@auntysarah @netcrusher88 they... really think they know a lot about us don't they? Where on EARTH do they get some of this crap?
,,,the band was cool though
oh my god this tiny bar like the back of the place was still barely 30 feet from the PA that shit was loud and my ears still hurt
@hikikomerri I kinda want some of those...
@ticky I am awesome

I wore skirts outside

nothing can stop me now
WEARING A SKIRT IN PUBLIC AND SHIT

FUCK YES

I AM ON TOP OF THE WORLD
@ticky hoy
.@hikikomerri but i'm gonna be forced to eat them like Wario in Wario Land 2. 

he looks so horrified when cake lands in his mouth
@CaelaBo hallo
give all the hugs and all the loves to @hikikomerri pls
Gosh I haven't been using twitter enough lately.

Hello
ugh this new keyboard is annoying and mushy feeling why did my old one have to literally melt on me
@snowth @hikikomerri Friday would be very doable. I do have plans but they aren't until at least 9pm. Friday is my birthday btw :D
So I never did go to this DRI show. Too much money, too many crappy opener bands, but the time DRI showed up I'd be too sleepy to have fun
@ThatSabineGirl when the GTAV ads started popping up I thought that's where they were going with it but... nope :(
there's a DRI show tomorrow

maybe I can get all this pent up frustration out of my system
I really thought they 'got' me, I really really thought they understood where I came from, I really did.
and they clearly don't fucking need, or even particularly want, me. I'm so fucking sick of getting backstabbed by "friends"
Everything I say gets twisted around on a daily basis, I'm constantly assumed hopelessly incompetent. I DO NOT NEED THEM.
I thought I could trust them and they understood me, but they fucking didn't, they still don't, nobody ever does.
of course they fucking hate me, they've hated me for a long time, they're just waiting until I'm fucking gone for good, or until I'm dead
@snowth @ixKylie I kinda miss clippy
oooyyyyuuuuggghhhh
@Shufflejoy ooooohhh dang, great find!
@Shufflejoy no srsly I want that shirt where can I get it? ;_;
@Shufflejoy I really want that shirt
lost my job, lost a good huge chunk of my support network, 

it's not been a happy day, but i'm trying.
'tis just me and @hikikomerri for t-giving this year, which is nice, at least we have each other, some people have less.
skip work 4 days due to depression

get back from the hospital about it

find out I was probably fired

what a thanksgiving
@meauxdal and I think they're right. This is hard, but remember, it's not you.
@meauxdal Someone told me that if this sort of thing was a matter of willpower or self analysis, nobody would ever have a mental illness.
@meauxdal a lot of us fall into these sorts of places, in varying degrees. Sometimes it's worse for some, but that doesn't make you bad.
@meauxdal @duchessburgtalk I've been needing to clean out my follow list for a while now

I don't know who I follow to be honest
@meauxdal *hugs*
@meauxdal It's okay to be hurt. It's okay to rest. As long as you need.

Just make sure you wake up eventually, okay?
@meauxdal You've got a lot. Fuck the people who can't see. 

Live to spite them. Exist as a living middle finger to their bullshit.
@meauxdal standing beside you, sister

I know it's hard
@meauxdal you are loved
AWESOME DAY

UP 24 HOURS NOW

9 MORE TO GO

*drinks super sugared up coffee*
I've found that "ooyy" has quickly become my favorite negative expression
Also I feel like this expression reflects my general mood as of late quite well
New avatar, still features tongue sticking out.

I should keep this as a theme.
Merri doesn't think my "doo do do do do do dodo doo" song is catchy :C
I'm finding myself literally trying to work out stuff like where to store my things in case we end up homeless.

oy...
That's not the really bad part though, the REALLY bad part is that I'm DEEPER in the red each paycheck
so i've found myself caught in a cycle of having a negative balance after each paycheck after expenses.
that amazing wonderful feeling when some random fuck gives you $12 just 'cause they like your music

omg i'm glowing
@meauxdal YOU'VE AWAKENED THE SHEEPLE LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
@GivMeUrIndieLit Just read up a bit on what happened. I'm so sorry, that's just awful. Best wishes to you.
@mizabitha it's probably a cartoon character wardrobe: several pairs of identical underwear
oh my god these songs are AWESOME what the fuck why did this project stop D:


Just a live thing from 2011, this project seems dead too, but it's fun stuff. Very similar vein to YM.
yay yay yay found a thingy that the singer of Yellow Machinegun made after said band broke up.
@PrincessPinkie there's so many confusing things about that. Why would he yell that? Had he never seen a scene kid? Are they a myth?
oh right, nails. 

I like these colors :) 
@snowth "this is a SIGN!"
@angille I don't even have any clear coats.... D:
downside of applying nail polish when you aren't good at it: your dominant hand looks fucked up 'cause you had to paint it with ur other one
@ThatSabineGirl having learned a thing or two about bees i'd imagine that for the male bees sex is NEVER fun. NEVER.
@TorrentOfAngry @ThatSabineGirl @untimelygamer do they not realize that patreon is basically a paid subscription to an artist's work?
I feel bad saying "fuck you dog" I love that dog

but what an asshole
we just took the dog out

she comes in

walks over to a pillow

and pees on it

fuck you dog
Just because I don't find something offensive doesn't mean I get to tell you how you should feel about something.
I honestly cut people a lot of slack for being ignorant on trans things. 

Doesn't mean I get to tell other people they should do the same
I really don't want to watch Wandering Son

I'm pretty sure I'd just make me really really upset.
how the HECK do cables get so tangled
ilu @hikikomerri
yesterday i came home to this drawing and I don't think I could've been happier 
djender
@actualjellyfish I wonder what the closet trans to chaser ratio is there
@emily_esque @ZJemptv if you're trans shitheads basically flipflop your gender as it's convenient for them to insult you
@ZJemptv what is UP with their obsession with anal sex

they can't shut up about it

do they not understand that most gay ppl don't do anal?
i'm sleepy enough that I briefly forgot what your'e supposed to do if you're sleepy

also everything tastes bad right now I just noticed
@FuckCisPeople trans**

* - you shouldn't put an asterisk there
@blanksylvia @FakeRobotGamer so many gross people this is depressing
@VanguardVivian Heh, at least ya'll actually HAVE a process for doing that.

Here in Texas you p. much have to bribe a judge.
@ixKylie @destroyed4com4t holy shit wow that is the most uhm

wow

what the fuck
@ticky I haven't had a haircut in ~10 yrs. I was (and still am) a huge metalhead but I also liked giving myself pigtails when I was alone...
@emitans I love how the word "matriarch" has pretty much been entirely replaced withi "misandrist" at thispoint
@meauxdal I am absolutely certain that someone out there finds you very endearing.

They certainly seem to like your music!
@meauxdal I'm kinda a bit of a shit sometimes so yeah

ur fine
@meauxdal yeah I know that feeling
I'd totally go get a femme haircut if I were out at work

I'm already pushing it far enough by getting my work clothes from the women's dept
@VanguardVivian @elenaiwilliams I saw this just as my girlfriend told me "don't squeeze me too hard I'll fart"
@leahvelcro but what if i want to look like a femme metalhead
@meekstape @meowrobot I found some folders full of old embarassing awful art. 

It's old, embarassing, and awful but I'm glad i kept it.
I haven't had a haircut in 10 years I think it'd scare me tbqh.
@leahvelcro yes
@leahvelcro lol I've done this 

I have no idea when I'll ever get around to getting a haircut though
ugh I need a better mp3 player the PSP leaves a lot to be desired.

I miss my old ipod video with Rockbox on it but it wasn't very sturdy
@estrogen_angel Oh totally, like "Hey I made this... and it's not bad! I kinda like it!"

I still feel like a dork though haha.
@estrogen_angel I always feel like the biggest git on the planet when I listen to my own music haha.
@estrogen_angel And I'm glad if I can help, even just a teensy lil' bit
@estrogen_angel Life really sucks sometimes, but you've got people cheering you on, even if they don't always know what to say.
@estrogen_angel I know that feeling too. It'll be okay. 

I wish I could say something that didn't feel trite.

*hugs* is trite but

*hugs*
@estrogen_angel It does, but just try to keep in mind that it very rarely actually helps. Isolation isn't a good thing, as tempting as it is
@estrogen_angel I've had those moments. It will pass. 

Just hang in there! :(
@estrogen_angel I just woke up it's okay
@estrogen_angel Oh that went right over my head.

oop
@estrogen_angel I actually found out a couple of trans women who I like and respect a lot aren't on HRT yet either

Not posers.
ignorant transphobic comments in every trans article

sigh
@ticky eyeliner just takes practice, like anything else really. The more confident you get at it, the better it looks too.
@ticky Yeah what stings most is knowing i'm going to go into a place where EVERYONE is going to say "sir" and "he"
@ticky I'm been femming up my boymode more and more. It's at the point where 'bout the only difference is boymode isn't wearing eyeliner
@ireneista @mirell Oh, certainly, but I think the language views thing explains the whole 'transsexual' vs 'transgender' deal
@mirell @ireneista yeah that's what I mean, not too long ago it was encouraged, and now it's not 'cause turns out it has bad implications
@ireneista @mirell I feel HBS is hard to explain in something tweet length, so yeah my explanation is really off. :P
@ireneista @mirell see also the trans asterisk, which was in use for a while and then quickly fell out of favor. I don't see it v often now
@mirell @ireneista People who are pro-gatekeeping, basically. They have some narrow views.
@mirell I think it's a generational thing maybe? Language and  terminology seems to change really fast, even old blogs feel weird to read
@ColdmanHot @SchalaAsha @DrPalutena 420+ games, 11 consoles, :P. I don't regret selling at all, but I do kinda wish I still had a lot of it.
@SchalaAsha @DrPalutena @ColdmanHot this kinda makes me miss my game collection :(
@CyberZixx and you are very welcome. :)
@CyberZixx Oh and yeah, don't forget to have your levels checked! Sometimes you gotta get the dosages just right in order to really feel it
@mirell Good idea. I've already got quite a bit of excess E to last me now.
@mirell &gt;I don't know, he seems kinda wreckless. Just throwing someone from 4mg to 10mg can't be soemthing most endos would do...
@mirell As I have experienced first hand :P.

I dunno what's up with this doc. He's cheap and works with you and does informed consent, but&gt;
@mirell I guess right now what I'm wondering is why my levels matter if I'm getting the changes I wanted anyways
@mirell doc said my E levels were way lower than they wanted, hence the big bump, but I feel that we should've taken the increases slowly.
@mirell Everything scared me, everything made me angry and frustrated and  upset, and I didn't care what the consequences of anything were
@mirell It had me in a constant state of panic and frustration and a self-destructive level of apathy, especially wrt my own well being
@mirell he doubled my spiro, which is working fine for me, but having that way high E dose really fucked me up. I might've even lost my job
