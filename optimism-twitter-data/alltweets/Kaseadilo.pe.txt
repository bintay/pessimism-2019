@johannaamarie class in June but home for the majority of summer
@johannaamarie when are we gona slayerfest it up?
How is it that we just got a huge dinner rush and I still made next to nothing in tips?
Can't wait to be home and have cable again so I can binge watch @MTV
I don't want to be mean, but if my headphones are in AND there's a textbook on my lap, maybe you don't need to talk to me.
Some kid just threw up all over the desk in class. #yayfinalsweek
Never in my life been so happy to be done with a class. History of Modern China, I hate you so much.
May the fourth be with you... #StarWarsDay
@hankgreen @johngreen mattress surfing, obviously.
Good luck to everyone at PSACs today! Go Rock!
@Some_Wierdy  
@KurpakusCorinne @chloekurpakus Jesus Christ Corinne. Cause I didn't happen if it's not a tweet and a snapchat story lol
@GospelOfSam I hate you
@GospelOfSam nope. Forever banned.
@GospelOfSam you are forbidden from owning my art. #you'reajerk
@GospelOfSam I thought we were friends, Sam.
@Some_Wierdy twenty bucks. So take that, that's a pizza and a side salad.
I just sold my first piece of artwork. Take that, mom, art can be a job!
Worst part about transferring schools? Everyone assumes you've seen the teacher evaluation before, but it's a totally different paper.
I'm hungry to the point that I can't decide what's more important: paying rent or buying all the sandwiches.
@emma_c_preston @Some_Wierdy it was the worst! But at the same time it wasn't lol
Sometimes I'm thinking about J&amp;R day camp and get really sad when I can't remember some of the kid's names. @emma_c_preston @Some_Wierdy
I've had the worst day on the best rainy storm day. Bring on the thunder, it soothes me.
Of course it's going to rain today.
I'm pretty psyched to be here and not in Mississippi but why is it that BOTH schools are still making things difficult?
Nice weather and a long walk makes me wish I was confident about my skateboarding abilities. #wanabeskater
Shout out to @Some_Wierdy who RUINED my vocal cords just in time for my presentation today. Perfectly timed but overly aggressive choke hold
Back at Saint Joe's track practice! I had forgotten what it was like to train in a parking lot.
@KurpakusCorinne EVERYONE STAY OFF THE ROADS. DANGER.
This is the first time I've actually felt a little confident about what I'm going to do with my life after college. #artmajorproblems
@johannaamarie I thought so. I'm next week:/
@johannaamarie when's your break?
Let's go Rock! Good luck everyone!
My toes are frozen from the cold but my tongue is burnt from my coffee. My body is conflicted.
I love art, but currently despise printmaking. #killmenow
@johannaamarie @RelatableQuote SlayerFest soon?
@johannaamarie @RelatableQuote KAKISTOS
Just fell asleep during a test. Why did you think it was a good idea to PowerPoint present your test questions?
@katyperry where did you get those shark costumes?! I would wear it every. single. day.
Sweet Jesus, my throat. Did I eat a handful of gravel last night, because that's the only logical explanation for this malarkey.
Chubby @prattprattpratt may be the best Chris Pratt. #ParksandRec
