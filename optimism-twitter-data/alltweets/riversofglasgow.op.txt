@TMIScotland @cassieclare reminds me of this fanart! 
Farage is staying? His resignation was one of the only good things to happen during the election #ffs


How did Labour do so badly in England?
Carmichael won by 817 votes. That's painful.
Gutted that Alistair Carmichael held Orkney and Shetland.
Actually she's the youngest since the 17th century!!
@maureenjohnson Fun SNP fact: 20 year old student Mhairi Black just became the youngest British MP since the 19th century!
30,000 votes exactly! FUCKIN HELL!!
Sick of everyone blaming Scotland. Labour could've been predicted to win EVERY Scottish seat and they'd STILL be miles behind the Tories.
@WingsScotland Douglas Alexander lives down the road from me, *dying* to put a wee condolences card through his door tomorrow
@secret12345 Paisley and Renfrewshire North - lots of wealthy rural areas in this constituency
In 2010 Labour had a majority of over 15,000 here. I wasn't expecting the SNP to get this seat but now I don't know...
Paisley North is my constituency! If that's true it'll be *extraordinary*.
Going to miss them after today @SNPwindaes 
Had to queue to get into the polling station but it was worth it. Good luck @GavNewlandsSNP!
Classics exam tomorrow #yikes
In 2010 Labour had a majority of over 15,000. I'm hopeful but not very optimistic I'm afraid... #VoteSNP 
@Catreads the 2nd way, they've said it on Supernatural before :)
Though not as bad as the advanced higher one where I literally just cried all the way through
Had an absolute mind blank in my french speaking exam holy shit it was bad!!

Er there's plenty of people pissed off with Scot …
Thanks Eddie.
La…
#SNPbecause if it weren't for their commitment to free education I simply wouldn't be at university today.
Great weather to be out leafleting for @GavNewlandsSNP! #activeSNP 
It took AGES to get that selfie!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED TO ME!!! @NicolaSturgeon #SNP 
@WingsScotland sightings of Chinooks over Penicuik #ScotRiots
UKIP manifesto: "[Britain] led the way in the abolition of the slave trade." Um, about that...
My mum got a new job! <PARTY POPPER> So happy because her current one causes her so much stress.
Need to do literally anything other than just sleep all day.
At the CND rally at George Square!! :) 
Starting work at 7am is unholy
"Thrilled to be doing a UK tour!" Ah yes, 8 dates in England! What a fantastic 'UK tour' that is! #bye
Wait they're going to make top gear without him?? It needs to be cancelled, they're taking the piss.
Perfectly aware that Clarkson is a twat, doesn't mean I'm not allowed to be upset that a show I've loved since I was eight is over.
Old guy at the bus stop waited till he saw me stuff my face with chocolate before engaging me in conversation, why??
Two french exams today, pray for me
Also this taxidermy penguin at kelvingrove was horrifying, god 
I was about to give up and go back to class when it appeared. The astronomers *shrieked* in delight, so exciting <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Genuinely the only break in the clouds was right in front of the eclipse, for seconds.
Didn't bring my camera because it was meant to be so cloudy but at least you can see it! 
Why is cineworld so opposed to showing films before 11.30am
I swear I have unsubscribed at least 4 times and yet I still get this shite from SLabour 
In other news, tomorro…
May 15th is a bad day for me. Got a two hour Latin paper in the morning then a two hour French paper in the afternoon.
Waiting to see Run All Night. I have an embarrassing weak spot when it comes to Liam Neeson.
Difficult to think that someone who brought my family so much joy is gone. #RIPTerryPratchett 

@louisebrealey the link you need is 
@BBCNews so the general election campaign has proven too hopeless for miliband after all
One sentence in this essay is 56 words long. A teacher once marked me down because I had too many with over 30. I have a problem.
@BBCNews christ almighty
managed to say an ENTIRE sentence in french today, first class honours here i come
Who is it I sue if there's an Indiana Jones 5?
On way to uni, had about 50min sleep and feeling a bit loopy
These people presenting on sky oscars are terrible good god give me strength
At least the baftas don't have adverts, this is killing me
I'm sorry this is the cringiest thing I've ever seen?? I can't stand american awards shows omg
SO IT WAS JANE YES!??

MY HEART IS RACING #EELive
The Kelvin is the brownest, smelliest river I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure it's 90% raw sewage.
I really want these Star Trek coasters but they're expensive as hell <UNAMUSED FACE> 
Arghh eastenders time!
I HATE JOHN WINCHESTER
thank god for eduroam
found a nice bit of light reading for before i go to sleep :) 
anyway, SO glad i got tickets to see hamlet in september lmao
Tbh I'd probably pay £125 if it wasn't on top of the ~£500 needed to stay in London
@FrartinMeeman i've seen supernatural cons where you pay $1000 and that's literally just to get a front row seat at a talk lmao
what is the reasoning behind showing the baftas on a two hour delay, literally who decided this
Tonight's top gear looks like it's going to be hilarious thank god
It causes me actual pain to remember that I've not got tickets for AC/DC OR Taylor Swift, like I have 0 things to look forward to this year
Last time he just never turned up at all, I've literally never met the guy lmao
The lecturer posted at quarter past ten that the ten o'clock class was cancelled #thanks
I SO want to go to the sherlock convention but considering the fact I would have to go stay in London alone..? Very unlikely :(
So the local Chinese takeaway doesn't open on Tuesdays anymore?? I'm devastated.
I CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS
literally just kill me 
UGHHH DAMMIT MURRAY #AusOpenFinal
Tennis always seems boring when you're not watching it, then you start watching it and are crapping yourself the whole time #AusOpenFinal
I can't even decide on my own theory about what the special is going to be about, setlock just makes me more confused tbh
Just preordered Paddington and Kingsman, my two favourite films right now. Which is slightly worrying, come to think of it...
KINGSMAN WAS SO GOOD I WANT TO SEE IT FIVE MORE TIMES
I can't even express how much I prefer Odeon to Cineworld lmao
About to watch Kingsman. No idea what it's about but it has Colin Firth in it so I have nothing to lose really.
It took me two and a half hours to get to uni because there's one centimetre of snow.
When the teacher didn't show up in high school it was amazing, but if the lecturer doesn't show up in uni it's actually life ruining.
@cumberbatchfrm The BC Top Gear episode was in 2013! I believe it was James Blunt in ep3 here :)
New series of Top Gear looks fantastic! Can't wait :D #EveningWithTG
The Shaun the sheep movie looks amazing??
Jesus god why is my lecture on the 11th floor I think I just coughed up my lung #betterdirectionstolifts2k15
I got really confused when I saw the two towers finished on page 742 because it's skinnier than fellowship, and that only had 407.
I didn't realise that my set of LoTR has a continuous page count across the three books.
God I'm tired
I would've been fine if he'd lost to anyone else tbh <CONFUSED FACE>
My bus is in like four hours. WHY did the golden globes have to coincide with my first day back at uni?? <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
I wish US awards ceremonies were on the east coast instead of the west, I hate this 8 hour time gap. 5 hours I could bear.. #goldenglobes
I THOUGHT SEASON 10 HAD ALREADY BEEN CONFIRMED AS THE LAST SEASON?? #WHAT #SupernaturalS11
It's so difficult to find a job that I could do around my uni hours :(
#tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers #CharlieHebdo #JeSuisCharlie 
Feel like going for a walk but the weather is so shitty <UNAMUSED FACE>
Filming is now underway on the #Sherlock Special, coming to @BBCOne in 2015. 
aahhhh tonight the UK is FINALLY getting season nine of Supernatural! Thank you @E4Tweets!
12.20pm, the earliest I've got up this year so far! Not looking forward to getting up in time for a 9 o'clock lecture next Monday <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Something tells me I made a mistake not watching Broadchurch...
One week left until uni starts back, looking forward to it since I changed subjects from theatre to classics! #thankgod

@GenyDeee you let the dishes soak in it instead of putting the plug in, so you can keep the tap running when you're doing the dishes! :)
I can't believe I have an exam tomorrow who the hell organises an exam to be on a Saturday <UNAMUSED FACE>
Going to see the Hobbit at the imax later, can't believe it's going to be over <PENSIVE FACE> #BOFA
