@_Amy93 very true!! Especially because summer is coming <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> and banana slushies!! #stillakid #howdoyouadult #bananaslushies

yeah but he dropped out of Harvard not 11th grade intensive reading
@_Amy93 thank you, as are you!! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ a little bit of prayer, a lot of caffeine and apples, and some time management is all you need :)
@_Amy93 omg wow o.o okay... Well, I'll pray for you! You seem quite intelligent and driven, it'll be stressful but I'm sure you'll be okay!
@_Amy93 that's odd then :/ I figured it could be like my 9cred writing class with 1 textbook but 8+ books. Idk what to say :/ learn to skim?
#BeMagical #BeYou 
@_Amy93 oh alright, that's cool! Ok, so think about it - how many books do your 1 credit courses normally have?
@_Amy93 but you can do it! Time management is imperative, unfortunately :/ not many people are good at managing their time lol
@_Amy93 your school's credit system works different from mine but I assume 2 credits is a lot? :) that's an insane amount of reading
@_Amy93 that's insane?!? Think about how you would've handled it during the normal school year though :/ that's too much. Wow
Mental note: visit a hypnotist to break nail biting habit
@_Amy93 trust me when I say that a good night's sleep (8+ hrs) and some meditation really helps. You can do it!

BUT he'd pay me for it (obvi) so that's like an extra almost $1000 towards next year's tuition. I'm so conflicted.
Kinda conflicted cuz, y'know, I wanted some time off to recuperate - something I didn't get to do after exams
So I might be going to court with my boss for the next two weeks. He's having Josh and I help him carry his documents, and I might stay.

I take such pride out of creating beautiful sims - what is "beautiful"?? For this particular sim, it's almost looking like Leonard from TBBT
2. If she had picked up, I would've let her claim some of my stuff in a make-shift will on my phone. But no. @feliciafalconer
1. Her voicemail recording sounds nothing like her. She sounds adorable, but she also sounds like a 12 year old. @feliciafalconer
Worried that I would be murdered while walking home in the dark, I called @feliciafalconer for protection.
Am I the only one who likes balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing in this house?? Really?? It's like liquid gold

I'm sorry, I have such a grumpy/sassy edge today and I don't understand why.
@feliciafalconer @_morganliane I'm trying! People seem to be harshing my vibe though and it's like geez, I just wanna be happy OK
@feliciafalconer @_morganliane ok but am I the only one who just wants to LIVE and not be so worried about weight/judgement/going to hell??

@shubcroc I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED IT BUT I PANIC WHEN I HAVE NO CONTROL SO I IMAGINE ITS VERY SCARY
@shubcroc it's okay lovely. Go back to sleep, love you <FACE THROWING A KISS><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<SLEEPING FACE>
Sometimes I miss my high school friends and their goofy, spontaneous and forever sarcastic ways of conversing with the caps lock on.
@shubcroc isn't that what happens normally in the middle of the REM cycle? Like during the deepest sleep level?
@shubcroc all of the above. I'll be the bodyguard manning the door and secretly dancing in the corner
@shubcroc ewwwwww I seriously would NOT last a day. Like, not even an hour. I'd be out of that house so fast my freaking head would spin.
@shubcroc bitch wtf happened to TEXTING OR CALLING ME ugh I'm gonna have to beat this into you, aren't I
~and she's so far gone~ #SamHunt
It seems so foreign now even to just see the spelling of Gramma Gayle's name. It hasn't even been a year and yet, she seems so far gone.
I wish I could just talk to my deceased family members, like hey Great Granddad how ya been? How's it hangin' Aunt Marg? Nana? Gramma Gayle?
I just wish I could talk to her and Nana again. But I know that if I ever had the chance, I'd never want to stop. I wish I was a medium.
#StoryOfMyLife  
And I miss her smell. A mix of sunscreen or body lotion, depending on the season, mixed with shampoo and fabric softener. MY Gramma Gayle.
I just wish I could hugs her and hear her dragged out hum before she says goodnight &amp; not to sleep too late in the morning. I miss her hugs.
Gramma Gayle no doubt spent today celebrating her birthday with Nana up there in heaven, drinking Baby Duck (her fave wine) &amp; eating lobster
So today was Gramma Gayle's birthday. Spent my day watching a creepy movie, singing as loud and terribly as possible, and home working.

BUT if I stay awake all night, then I won't sleep on it and therefore won't have to wash away the kinks.
I really don't want to go to bed... Cuz when I wake up my nice salon-straightened hair will be slept on and kinky. And I'll have to wash it.
"Ohhhh, Maxy...." 
I'm sorry, but does anyone else relate to Sia's "Elastic Heart" on an emotional and spiritual level? #ElasticHeart #FightingForPeace
~You did not break me~
But then I remembered: you're too busy verbally abusing your "friends" and wallowing in self-pity to ever care about me. And I'm better off.
During that split second that I felt semi-proud of myself &amp; wanted someone to be FULLY proud of me, I thought of you. I wanted it to be you.
You haven't crossed my mind much in mths, but tonight when I wanted to tell someone that I FINALLY finished geology, I wanted to tell you.

I'm gonna cry. The first day I can play in over two weeks AND THE GAME CRASHES BEFORE I CAN SAVE.
NOOO I JUST LOST MY GAME
Still not sure if I want the Habs or the Sens to take it. I dislike players on both teams, but I love Price &amp; respect some Sens. Decisions.

But now I'm clean.
I can't decide whether I like it or not and it's killing me. I can only ever make it through like half the song. I just don't know.
SO THERE'S THIS SONG.
Got my hair trimmed today, and now my back is itchy. Let my night of endless itching and not being able to reach, begin.

So during my crim exam yesterday, what song was stuck in my head? Sorries by @andeeofficial
It was so bad I actually caught myself humming.

I love going by the childcare centre. The kids look so incredibly cute and displeased.

Excuse me for bumping into you, I'm tweeting while walking to Scott to print.
BUT: I'm almost done. I AM ALMOST D O N E.
Now to eat, print and study. I have a WHOLE 1/2hr. 30 mins, ladies and gents, to print my summaries, eat, and study. #queenoftimemanagement

@grounder76 thank you <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ mum said the same thing today. This class is not worth the stress that it's causing, I can only do my best.
When your brother tells you how much he loves you, without you saying it first. What a wonderful, heart warming moment #lovemybrother <BLUE HEART>
@grounder76 thank you!! I'm trying, it just seems like so much work to do in so little time. Y'know? I can't wait for the end of this week.
AND THAT, my friends, breaks 11,000 tweets. Ohhhhh boy.
NEVER let anything/anyone make you feel small or stupid or worthless. Don't put up with that shit. You're worth so much more than you think.
In fact, NOTHING should ever make you feel that way. Your life is so much more than school or a rumour or a failing friendship. You're more.
Like, no class should ever make you hate your existence so much that you want nothing more than to sink into your bed and not wake up.
I have cried to myself so much because of this damn class. It's so confusing cuz I love crime and criminal law. But I can't do this anymore.
The amount of inner strength and discipline that I need to finish this crim is physically impossible. I am so beyond done. I just want out.
Never question me. Nothing I say ever REALLY makes sense.
@shubcroc see, I love how you get me
Also: I LOVE THE RENTER. He's so sweet &amp; cute &amp; his notepad makes him even cuter, so does the "yes" or "no" written on his hands.
See, I am the #queen of #insidejokes. Only @shubcroc will understand that tweet.

I am so conflicted. I feel bad wanting to sleep cuz I'm SO CLOSE to being done, but in reality it's about 4+ hrs worth of MORE lecture notes
OKAY: so, to continue studying, which could take up upwards of three hours, or to read some fan fiction to wind down and then sleep.
I have no idea how I will ever survive living on my own. I am so painfully afraid of the dark, it's both pathetic and embarrassing.

I could still be a crisis negotiator! Right?? I think so. Or I could enrich the minds of our youth by teaching. Or I could be both.
Think about it, professional writing means I can articulate my ideas in a clear &amp; concise way on paper, sociology says I understand society.
Crim is becoming too stressful and upsetting. I have cried far too much over this damn course, so I think it's time to set it free.
Starting to seriously consider switching to a degree in professional writing. Maybe add sociology or psychology too. 
Literally what I'm doing right now. Almost haven't stopped crying since my lecture this afternoon.
