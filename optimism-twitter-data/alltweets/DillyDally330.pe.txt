@TheBandMessiah @RussellTpot  atheists refuse 2 accept the law of causality or big bang theory bc it doesn't fit their ideology o Im laffin
@RussellTpot God isn't nothing. He doesn't need to use materials lol.
@SkyMeraki @TheBandMessiah I don't know but I'd think not.
@TheBandMessiah are you a poe or are you purposefully being dishonest? The universe began to exist, God didn't. You don't understand that??
@SkyMeraki @TheBandMessiah we don't, only in how much He reveals Himself to us.
@TheBandMessiah God never came into existence. The universe did. Do you really not understand the distinction?
@TheBandMessiah God didn't have a beginning, the universe did. (Big Bang theory proved this decades ago.)
@TheBandMessiah the law of causality, something can't come from nothing
@TheBandMessiah quite a bold claim to be making,  you wanna prove it?
@TheBandMessiah Son of God is more of a title as His 2nd person in the Trinity. He literally was/is God incarnate in flesh.
@TheBandMessiah are you claiming a  1st century Jewish man named Yeshua never existed or you just don't think He was deity incarnate?
@TheBandMessiah of course He is.
@TheBandMessiah typical cis white male privilege. You have been reported to Hilary Clinton and Tumblr for your thought crimes.
@TheBandMessiah and now you're mental illness shaming!! How dare you call yourself an LBGTQA+-12GHFS ally or a feminist?!?!
@TheBandMessiah not until you repent of your patriarchal ways and submit to the vagina goddess sophia and pay reparations for being CIS
@TheBandMessiah surprised you claim to be a feminist yet u don't know what #mansplaining is. Just a CIS tool of the #problematic #patriarchy
@TheBandMessiah yes my liberal friend.
@TheBandMessiah  what a tolerant liberal! Better hope I don't report this to the  crazies on tumblr or they'll accuse you of #mansplaining
Atheist Andy: The world's leading pseudo-historian.
@atheist_andy you said "they were still Christians" and a crusade against Gnostics in medieval aged in EUROPE?? [Citation needed]
@atheist_andy @Atheist_DH Gnosticism has more in common with Luciferians then Christians.
@atheist_andy @Atheist_DH like Mormons do todayThe church was being eaten by lions when Gnosticism was popular, they weren't persecuting ne1
@atheist_andy @Atheist_DH opposed because they hijacked the name of Christ to make their anti-Christian nonsense seem more legitimate, much
@atheist_andy @Atheist_DH  You don't get to define what a Christian is and isn't 
@Paula_White 
@Atheist_DH tv documentaries meant to be sensational like ancient aliens.
@Atheist_DH  please tell me how the God of the OT being an evil demon is CHRISTIANITY? I study this stuff actually rather then watching bad
@Atheist_DH how is that Christian?? You need to watch this. 
@Atheist_DH Christians believe Jesus was YHWH incarnate, Gnostics believe YHWH was an evil demon and they believed in multiple gods,
@Atheist_DH nope that's liberal lies. Christians fought against Gnosticism because it wasnt Christianity read against heresies by Iraneus
@Atheist_DH lol no they didn't,, Gnosticism was DEFINITELY not taught by any of Christ's disciples. It was Greek mysticism.
@atheist_andy was YHWH incarnate and the cross is the central message, theyre TOTALLY different religions(there r many more differences btw)
@atheist_andy Gnostics even believed? They believed YHWH was an evil demiurge and Jesus didn't die on the cross. Christians believe Jesus
@atheist_andy 3 of those books no one knows if they even existed, it's PURE speculation, the others are Gnostic texts.do you know what
@atheist_andy you're misrepresenting a subject you obviously don't even understand.
@atheist_andy why would we have GNOSTIC texts(which is an entire other religion made up later) or books that didn't exist in our bible?
@atheist_andy so either GNOSTIC gospels or hypotheticals made up by liberal scholars? 
@JaclynGlenn yes actually we do, remember that ray comfort video where the #atheists said they'd rather rescue their dog then a stranger?

@m_nimzzz and western liberals makes no sense to me.since Muslims DESPISE everything liberals stand for.
@m_nimzzz well I have read Bukhari, Muslim and the Koran and I can tell you they're very troubling. This bizarre alliance between islam
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart look what Muhammad(wrath of God be upon him) did to the Jews of Medina.
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart I don't have to live for 10 years in the ME to see Muhammad commanded subjugation and violence against Christians
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart treat Christians and Jews. I am a student of theology, Muslims may not be anti-Christian but islam is.
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart I actually don't watch much news lol. What worries me is what the Quran and Hadith actually teaches on how to

@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart it to my attention. I will study it some more, I still feel like Christians in Palestine would be better under

@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart it's  terrible, but I'd rather be a Christian in Israel then any other ME nation other then Armenia
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart Please tell me what I'm missing? Educate me, I know some Christians are attacked by radical Zionists in Israel and
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart  systematically oppressed, silenced, forced to pay jizya,raped or killed.
@m_nimzzz @GOP_Sweetheart the difference is that Christians attacked in Israel are attacked by renegade criminals, in Muslim lands they're

@moinedeisme  I can't describe how I believe I came to the.correct interpretation of 66 books written by 40 authors over TWITTER.
@moinedeisme could any of them interpret it the way you meant it to be interpreted? Yes or no??
@moinedeisme read and interpret it correctly??
@moinedeisme If you wrote a large book &amp; 100 people read it there would be different interpretations, are you implying no one could ever
@moinedeisme hermeneutics. u think that because there are different subjective opinions then there is no objective truth. That's fallacious
@moinedeisme hermeneutics. Only cults say those other Christian denominations aren't saved. The split in denominations are on minor issues
@moinedeisme the split in denominations are smaller doctrinal issues, nothing to do with salvation through Grace in Christ
@moinedeisme John 3:16 seems very clear to me that's how we're saved, Catholics are saved, Pentecostals are saved, Presbyterians are saved.
@moinedeisme dude what?we are saved by Grace in Christ alone, the atonement for our sins on the cross.what's that have to do with Islam?
@moinedeisme people aren't saved by which denomination they belong to.
@moinedeisme what??

@cutebmo are infants in the womb NOT voiceless and helpless??
Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be to You the Only Wise KING #NationalDayofPrayer 
@BarryPie123 @ouijameme this is true, I should not be surprised that a commie supports genocide and death
@cutebmo is permissible.
@cutebmo my roommate is a young black man raised in foster care. He's been a blessing in my life. I don't believe killing him in the womb
@cutebmo  do you believe in fighting for the helpless and voiceless?
@cutebmo pro-choicers say pro-lifers don't care enough for the baby or mother after birth and I agree! The answer is to help them and adopt.
@cutebmo the answer is to help out these women with social services when they have kids, encourage adoption and fund foster care.
@cutebmo ending of a human life Especially when 98% are done for convenience I'm not pro-life because I hate women, but because i Iove kids.
@cutebmo my heart hurts for women who die in illegal abortions, that doesn't mean we should legalize what I believe is the deliberate
@cutebmo @ouijameme I believe we SHOULD empower minorities by social services, not killing them Watch this short vid 
@cutebmo we don't let people murder infants outside the womb,  why inside the womb? Planned parenthood deliberately targets minorities
@cutebmo @ouijameme  obviously you didn't even read it This is the man who operates the website PP targets minorities 
@cutebmo @ouijameme 
@cutebmo  this is a first trimester baby. Maybe you don't believe she's a human like me and you. But I certainly do.

@lune_dea please believe me when I say I'm not "prolife" because I hate women or something, instead it's because I love children
@lune_dea is very sad, most "pro-choice" think it's analagous to removing a clump of jelly bc they've been mislead 
@lune_dea @sydxr 
@lune_dea @sydxr do you know what an abortion procedure actually is?(most people don't) what do you think it is??
@lune_dea well I have a good idea on how to empower them: Don't target them for abortions and get them to kill their own offspring
@sydxr @lune_dea so this is a "picnic" for you?? Doesn't look like a "picnic" to that completely helpless infant 
@sydxr @lune_dea Actions have consequences in no other circumstance does  irresponsibility justify murder. 
@lune_dea no one wants end abortion because we hate women, we hate infanticide and we love life. 
@lune_dea so instead of trying to empower minorities we should RIP APART THEIR INFANTS WITH PLIERS?!?
@sydxr @lune_dea 1.adoption 2.  not trying to ban legitimately needed health risk abortions. 3. Condoms are free. Actions have consequences
@lune_dea 
@sydxr @lune_dea  no I know exactly what abortion is I used to be "prochoice" until I studied what the procedure actually is.
@sydxr 
@sydxr @lune_dea what is "safe" about burning an infant to death?? It's not your body, that infant inside the womb has her own body.
@lune_dea That was a quote from racist PP founder Margaret Sanger, the abortion industry is and always has been designed to target blacks.
@lune_dea no actually I do and that's why I'm pro-life/pro birth control. Do you know what an abortion procedure actually is??
@sydxr @lune_dea or they use Saline to burn her to death. 
@sydxr @lune_dea Fetus is Latin for "little one" abortion is murder. They use pliers to tear her apart

@sainttoad @radicalabacus but if you're open-minded then take a look thanks. It's time for supper #GodBless and have a goodnight
@sainttoad @radicalabacus you asked for evidence. That's solid historical evidence. I already knew you wouldn't accept it,
@decemberskin @just_a_servant @666_slut I'm 23 lol.
@sainttoad His resurrection does though. 
@666_slut @just_a_servant  yes I believe so as this all started from a conservative woman being yelled at for saying the dress was immodest
@666_slut @just_a_servant  you're right you don't need our validation. I'm glad if women dress that way as it tells me who to avoid lol
@sainttoad Jesus existed as a historical personThis is an undisputed fact in academia, whether you believe He was divine or not is different
@666_slut @just_a_servant @decemberskin ok then they may do what they want and I may do what I want with my mouth and call them a harlot lol
@sainttoad it's not even an argument, everyone in academia accepts that it's a branch of philosophy, PhD stands for doctorate of philosophy.
@666_slut @just_a_servant @decemberskin so which is it?? You can't have it both ways. Lol
@666_slut @just_a_servant @decemberskin half of feminists say naked women in pop culture is empowering the other says it's objectification
@666_slut @just_a_servant @decemberskin do you really believe she didn't do it for attention??
@sainttoad the scientific method is a philosophical principle.
@sainttoad if you don't know\admit science is a branch of philosophy there's no reason to continue this discussion. It's a basic fact.
@sainttoad science is a branch of philosophy. This is a  basic fact. Are you really disputing this??   

@sainttoad science is a branch of philosophy ya goofball.
@just_a_servant @decemberskin @666_slut indeed, these celebrities radical feminists idolize do much more to objectify women then I EVER have

@sainttoad scientific evidence isn't all there is to discover truth.

@Taoist_Skeptic well everyone interprets politics through their worldview. I don't believe Christians shouldn't be allowed to vote lol.
@sainttoad but we all subjectively interpret that objective evidence differently (most blacks thought OJ was innocent, most whites guilty)
@Eschertology @sainttoad very sophisticated rebuttal.
@Taoist_Skeptic I'm not trying to do that, read the NT. Christianity means nothing if it's forced on people.
@sainttoad or people just deny evidence as it doesn't fit with their worldview and presuppositions.
@Taoist_Skeptic why aren't we allowed to bring our principles with us to the voting booth? You sound like the real totalitarian.
@sainttoad  "the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid." I have that.

@Shaper079 you haven't proven that it isn't actual, and of course religion or.lack thereof usually defines a culture more then any other
@Shaper079 but atheism is merely a "lack of belief" so your activism makes no sense. At least call yourself an antitheist
@Shaper079 actual alternative, is ultimately futile and really makes no sense.
@Shaper079 but I keep hearing atheism is only a "lack of belief" so atheism doesn't provide an alternative. Criticising something without an
@Shaper079  I lack a belief in Bigfoot or the Buddhism. I don't define my personalities around these things.
@Shaper079 I support neither of those 3 candidates so it's kinda irrelevant.
@Shaper079 I'm not talking about politics at all, also no one ever criticizes Obama for being a Christian or Pelosi for being Catholic.
Why do so many #atheists define their personalities by things they don't believe in?? It's  truly bizarre. #atheism

@RevDaniel it seems you don't know what persecution actually is, so I'm educating you.

#WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough  Abortion is deliberate black genocide 



#WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough  Christ is LORD of all. He is seated at the right hand of the Father and will come again to judge everyone.
#WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough  Wrath of God
@dracdrum you're aware that The Bible said the Earth was round and full of volcanic magma hundreds of years before science proved it.


@mayonaizz they are like their father, the Devil. 
The nations raged,
but your wrath came,
and the time for the dead to be judged,
and for rewarding your servants,the prophets and saints,
KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. 

That's the God whom I serve and that's the God against whom you've sinned. 
I was talking to a 21 year old girl who goes to a #PCUSA church &amp; she told me she was an elder at her church. 
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore I really hope you're not older then 15
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore he's your atheist higher power and prophet, you guys all bow down to the altar of atheist internet memes
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore according to an atheistic world view objective morality doesn't exist, even Dawkins will admit this
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore I know exactly what they are an I can account for objective law with an objective law giver, you can't.
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore lol yes of course it does, if morality is only decided upon what society deems to be moral
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore  so by that logic when the people of Germany decided it was right to kill jews, that was objectively good
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore okay so where does that objective law come from without a lawgiver?
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore is it objectively wrong to do that or just subjective?
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore yes death is a fear, that goes without saying, but LITERALLY anything, is morality objective or subjective
@Stehlo_Gaming @pooroldkilgore is it subjectively or objectively wrong to do these things?
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS and once again you proved my point that morality IS objective and not subjective
@pooroldkilgore  is it objectively wrong or just subjectively wrong?
@DeJaReMeKS I will be praying for your soul, a relationship with God is a beautiful, fruitful and priceless thing.
@DeJaReMeKS "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8 This was written about YOU.
@DeJaReMeKS I'm asserting that there is no scientific explanation for these things, you're saying there is, burden of proof is on you
@DeJaReMeKS you keep saying people like me and C.S. Lewis are just "ignorant" but you can't actually explain why.
@DeJaReMeKS lol okay please explain to .me how "chemistry" could lead me to forgiving a person who murdered my family?
@DeJaReMeKS how does nature give us the desire to take vows of poverty, create beauty  or forgive someone after they've killed a loved one?
@DeJaReMeKS ohhh so without a guiding force, where does the recognition of beauty, truth-seeking, unconditional love or altruism come from?
@pooroldkilgore according to what standard?
@DeJaReMeKS according to what purpose?
@DeJaReMeKS explain to me why I should listen to someone whose opinion is nothing more than a random chemical process 
"Where there is neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian, Scythian,bond nor free:but Christ is all, and in all" ---Colossians 3:11
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS acceptable and encouraged thing to do in our society but I don't because I have a higher, objective moral law.
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS explain how I "pick and choose"? I don't fornicate, would I like to ? Honestly yes I would  and that's a completely
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum 
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS this is EXACTLY why people are weary of "atheism",  having no moral compass is a scary thing and it results in gulags
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS would it still be wrong or not?
@Skeptic_Matt and I beg you please don't ever use the Holy name I AM unless it's with strict reverence, that's a very very serious thing
@Skeptic_Matt you'll be in my prayers
@Skeptic_Matt He did reveal Himself to everyone, people just suppress it in unrighteousness, please read Romans 1 if you want an explanation
@Skeptic_Matt why would He have to? He's a holy judge and he will judge sinners accordingly, he does delight in delivering judgement
@Skeptic_Matt 1.because He doesn't have to 2. No he doesn't save everyone He does send some to Hell and He does it justly
@Skeptic_Matt  AGAIN you are going against 99% of experts to say a man named Jesus didn't die on a cross,  you have an incredible dogmatism
@Skeptic_Matt the creator of LITERALLY everything is not under any obligation to puny sinners like me and you
@Skeptic_Matt why does He have to? He literally allowed Himself  to be tortured to death for us and you have the AUDACITY to demand more??
@Skeptic_Matt disproven by the big bang theory
@Skeptic_Matt well it came into existence from nothing, that fits the definition of creation unless you say it's eternal which has been
@Skeptic_Matt does that somehow mean it didn't happen?? Lol. THIS is exactly why atheism is a religion.
@Skeptic_Matt between 100,000 people somehow it means it didn't happen, if only 10 people saw a car accident they'd report it differently
@Skeptic_Matt that really didn't "debunk" anything, it just says that because the miracle was not reported in concisely exact same detail
@Skeptic_Matt because people like you would just try to "debunk" it like that site tried to do, dismissing 100,000 is extremely dogmatic
@Skeptic_Matt read Romans 1 and Hebrews 1, He has revealed Himself through creation(something you can't account for) and His Word
@Skeptic_Matt if 100,000 people claimed to have been abducted at the same time in the same place I would take it very seriously
@Skeptic_Matt things with an open mind, instead you'll just dismiss the testimony of 100,000 because you're a dogmatical natural atheist
@Skeptic_Matt lol He has like in that list I showed you! Up to 100,000 people witnessed the miracle of Fatima! You do NOT look at these
@Skeptic_Matt He has revealed Himself through His Word, His Son and CREATION ITSELF, so He has revealed Himself just not up to your criteria
@Skeptic_Matt sobtheoretically if there is an omnipotent creator of everything He owes it to you to reveal Himself? Do you see the arrogance
@Skeptic_Matt well here are 10 just to start you off 
@Skeptic_Matt then let me ask you a question: what would it actually take for you to believe there is a God?
@Skeptic_Matt yes, 1 Corinthians 15:14-19
@Skeptic_Matt 1 time and matter came into existence. 2. Nothing cant create these things 3.therefore it requires a timeless immaterial being
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS so if the whole world discussed and came to the conclusion that genocide was okay, would it still be wrong?
@Skeptic_Matt you're extremely dogmatic! You actually tried to argue that Jesus wasn't a real person, something 99% of historians disagree
@Skeptic_Matt an incredible amount of faith and dogmatism to believe.
@Skeptic_Matt noI wouldn't call an agnostic or even a deist a religious person but atheists make objective truth statements that require
@DeJaReMeKS only law nature prescribes is to make as many babies as you can , Nazism was Darwinism pushed to it's logical conclusion
@DeJaReMeKS well Hitler believed that too, he believed the weak should be killed to benefit the strong in accordance with Darwinism
@dracdrum when you said "it's ABSOLUTELY EVIL" you admitted there is objectivity, or do you not know what absolutely means?
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum it's really really easy to refute that: who gets to define what's beneficial? You? The communist? The Nazis?  A nun?
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum 
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum 
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum I definitely don't agree, western countries are far from being the most moral, hence 3,000  babies murdered daily
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum okay so now morality is relative again? You have literally flip flopped 3 times now.
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum in India and middle eastern countries it's okay to have child brides, so according to you they're just unevolved?
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum if we all evolved to have morals, why are they so different between different cultures?
@dracdrum yes God IS wrathful and just, the midianites  committed infanticide and so He laid out His wrath on them, I'm not denying that
@dracdrum His moral law is objective, his judicial and ceremonial laws were only for Israel, seriously read the book of Hebrews.
@dracdrum read the book of Hebrews for your answer, again you're showing your ignorance of the book you criticize
@dracdrum that's saying if a man rapes a woman he must be accountable for it by paying a fortune, how is that condoning rape?
@dracdrum there are plenty of cultures where it's fine to rape and in nazi Germany it was fine to murder, societal morals change God's don't
@dracdrum because its not my standard, it's the standard of the author of morality, which we all disagree with which is why we need a savior
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS objectively marriage is only between 1 man and 1 woman.
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS you're right it will turn anyone's stomach because it IS objectively wrong and evil. That's my whole point
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS 
@DeJaReMeKS I agree with that completely, difference is I acknowledge where that standard came from, you don't.
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum okay so now you just did a full 180 and are arguing that there are objective morals?
@DeJaReMeKS  First you implied there were no objective morals, now you're saying there is something objectively wrong. You're self-refuting
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS nazis communicated and compared to the conclusion the holocaust was a good thing, you have too much faith in humanity
@dracdrum @DeJaReMeKS I agree, it is ABSOLUTELY evil, therefore morality isn't subjective, you proved my point.
@dracdrum your confusing His decree and His knowledge. If you can't grasp that I don't know what to say
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum is raping a child objectively evil, or is it just a difference of opinion?
@dracdrum you're trying to put a timeless entity inside the rules of time, he's the author of time and therefore writes the rules for time
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum and of course many atheists aren't immoral, but they have no standard of morality outside themselves
@DeJaReMeKS @dracdrum what do you mean by "proof"? It's a philosophical idea, that's like asking to "prove" the laws of logic.
@dracdrum 1. The attributes and decrees of God 2. Everyone does disagree, that's why we need a savior and that is the Gospel message.
@dracdrum no I believe the author of reality actually can create us with a consciousness and free will, two things science can not explain
@dracdrum right, that's your own subjective morales, the problem is you can't go beyond that as an atheist because you have no objectivity
@dracdrum well if you're going to say you have true free will in a purely natural reality, just remember you're at odds with most scientists
@Skeptic_Matt falls under that definition.
@Skeptic_Matt take it up with Random House Unabridged Dictionary, it's their definition not mine, but as you see your strand of atheism
@dracdrum 
@Skeptic_Matt most widely used definition of religion, implying everything came from nothing takes an incredible amount of dogmatism
@Skeptic_Matt "a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects" the second
@dracdrum yeah well the beautiful thing is even though one man brought death; one man also brought salvation, life and reconciliation
@dracdrum if I send you a 6 minute video on this subject will you promise to watch it and take it seriously?
@dracdrum even objectively judge anything because you have no objective standard.
@dracdrum well our God is indeed a wrathful God of justice, that doesn't somehow mean He doesn't exist. Besides, as an atheist you can't
@dracdrum no I'm not, what are you trying to get at?
@Skeptic_Matt dude what? When and where would I ever imply I don't believe in the supernatural?
We must FEAR the great I AM, to think of #God as some #pantheist #postmodern liberal in the sky is to disrespect and undermine your Creator
"God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." Exodus 3:14
@dracdrum 1. Yes I have 2. Stop trying to sound smarter than you are. 3. Youd have to give me an example of one. I'm sure I could explain it
@dracdrum serious question: have you ever even actually read the Bible? By their own accounts the disciples were CONSTANTLY doubting
@dracdrum if it wasn't wild it wouldn't be a miracle, would it? you're right fraud for gain is common, fraud for persecution &amp; death isn't
@dracdrum right, I can see you'd rather believe wild conspiracy theories, sorry I thought you were honestly seeking answers.
@dracdrum literally we have the body of st peter in Rome.
@dracdrum 
@dracdrum it's a consensus among historians most (if not all) of the disciples were martyred,  and this info comes from other sources
@dracdrum ok when there's a consensus among  expert historians people died for their eyewitness of it we'll talk.
@dracdrum @Skeptic_Matt if 500 people said you could fly and died horrible deaths because they saw you fly, I'd believe them

@ISeeStarfish "noting or pertaining to compounds formed through a chemical process by human agency, as opposed to those of natural origin:"
@ISeeStarfish literally is the adverb of literal which means "completely true and accurate : not exaggerated" how was my usage incorrect?
#BoycottDolceGabbana instead of getting mad about people being honest get mad at people using IVF when there are millions of needy orphans
#BoycottDolceGabbana Synthetic means the unnatural imitation of something natural, IVF is LITERALLY the definition of synthetic, sorry
Praying that God will bless the Presbyterian Church and her people at #nextchurch2015  and hold fast to the faith
#boycotteltonjohn  between abortion and synthetic children it's obvious liberals see children as just something to fulfill their wants
#BoycottDolceGabbana Wow Children have more value then a science experiment intentionally made without a parent to fulfill ur selfish plans

@lukeontheweb ok well then by your logic just don't be gay. Problem solved.
@lukeontheweb I'm actually totally against it, I'm pointing out if you support same sex marriage there is no protection against it or incest
@sk45202 no I'm not persecuted hut we're certainly marginalized and mocked like you are right now.
@sk45202 it's a symbol of solidarity with Christians being persecuted in the middle east

@fakedansavage besides, you're not actually for marriage equality, you say polyamorous relationships are wrong you're just a polyphobe bigot
@fakedansavage Ben Carson might of said that,I understand there are gay animals(you're a prime example)
@fakedansavage  yeah thousands of animals also rape their mates, but the fundamental difference is we believe humans are more than animals

@dracdrum @GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt read Romans 1. Paul puts it more eloquently then I ever could.
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum I loved all of them. of course I'm far from sinless I'm just a wretch saved Grace in Christ our Lord
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum I think you're suppressing truth in unrighteousness, whether you've deluded yourself enough idk
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum they love sin, I know I used to love mine. That's why it's so dangerous
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum well to be honest I don't believe in atheism. Everyone knows God exists they just deny Him because
@Skeptic_Matt with an open mind and He saved a sick sinner like me. I pray you'll be open minded to God. Have a good night.
@Skeptic_Matt and you'll be in my prayers, I was a former agnostic myself but I researched the historicity of Christ and read the Bible
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum just read your profile ,"fetish model" so you love your sin so you suppress the knowledge of God
@dracdrum @Skeptic_Matt  Many Buddhists and Taoists don't believe in a deity but they're still religions
@Skeptic_Matt @dracdrum god delusion is your holy book. Dawkins and Harris are your prophets and there are LITERALLY atheist churches
@GreekVikingX @derrickbrasher wow, well it was legal for the Nazis to murder jews, guess they weren't murderers and were innocent.
@GreekVikingX @derrickbrasher to murder another human being to avoid responsibilities
@GreekVikingX @derrickbrasher it's not like they randomly mysteriously became pregnant, actions have consequences you don't have a right
@dracdrum @Skeptic_Matt now you're disagreeing with historical fact for wild conspiracy theories. This is why atheism is a religion
@brushyblues @GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt Buddhism and Taoism dont believe in deities but they're religions. Atheism is absolutely a religion
@micahsgrrl @cooperlewis_ no I said compared to Arabs they're ethical, but like mother Theresa said: abortion is greatest evil of our time
@GreekVikingX @derrickbrasher there's something called adoption, but a 5 year old requires parents to survive by your logic we can kill them
@micahsgrrl @cooperlewis_ no not really, I do believe they're more ethical than the Arabs but I believe in libertarian principles
@brushyblues @Skeptic_Matt okay  by your reasoning let's just get rid of all history books. You can't prove history with scientific method
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt point of actually denying evidence and fact. This is why atheism is absolutely a religion
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt 
@RealtinConnor @derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX  by your logic a 3 yr old woman isn't actually a woman because she's different than a adult
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt  can't say ANYONE from the ancient world existed bc the new testament is the most attested document of antiquity
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt well it's too long to post on Twitter, but let's just say if you insist Paul, James and Jesus never existed you
@RealtinConnor @derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX @cooperlewis_ how is a baby with a vagina inside a womb not a woman?
@GreekVikingX @Skeptic_Matt ask any historian there is undeniable evidence the eyewitnesses existed. We have archaeological evidence of paul
@XRabbiDaveX @GreekVikingX if you tell a woman with a planned baby "THAT'S NOT YOUR BABY IT'S JUST A FETUS" you'll rightly be smacked
@RealtinConnor @derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX @cooperlewis_ are you saying a human doesn't have sex organs until born outside the womb?
@derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX  it's a human being with it's own DNA that will become an autonomous being unless prevented by violence
@derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX insertion rape with a phallus if you want to get technical.
@XRabbiDaveX @GreekVikingX Calling it a fetus is a trick used by killers to justify killing. you dehumanize it by calling it only a fetus
@fairytalejedi @Skeptic_Matt no you evaluate each one on a case by case basis, 99% of holy books don't claim to be eyewitness accounts
@derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX @cooperlewis_  you claim to be "#prochoice" for women what about the women inside the womb who have NO CHOICE
@derrickbrasher @GreekVikingX by your logic women can't condemn rape because it's an immoral act they can't physically do.
Every day 300 #Christians are killed  for their faith. Would you be willing to die for #Jesus ? He commanded us to love Him more than life
@Skeptic_Matt the universe to allow human life that just defies astronomical odds, I'd certainly say that itself is a miracle
@Skeptic_Matt "miracles don't exist therefore miracles don't exist" and I'd actually contend when you look at the extreme fine tuning of
@Skeptic_Matt well like I said before miracles by definition are not demonstrable THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MIRACLES. your circular reasoning is
@Skeptic_Matt okay give me one  single example of hundreds hallucinating the exact same thing for 40 days straight and willing to die for it
@Skeptic_Matt  actually if you applied the same standard to other historical documents as you do to the Bible we couldn't do any history
@Skeptic_Matt So you're implying hundreds of people who saw him risen hallucinated? You're trying to use a miracle to explain away a miracle
@Skeptic_Matt 
@Skeptic_Matt had no choice but to believe He was God 
@Skeptic_Matt it's not that they thought He was God like followers of Jim Jones, it's that they literally saw him rise from the dead and
@SamHarrisOrg rewrites Marx and Nietzsche in 21st century wording and somehow people think he's intelligent and original? #atheism
 via @RCSproulJr
@Skeptic_Matt why is it unreasonable? Are you limiting an infinitely powerful creator can't enter into His creation??
@Skeptic_Matt well by your 21st fundamental atheist position people like Isaac Newton, Herschel etc ad infinitum would be "fanatics"
@Skeptic_Matt testimony from religious people is unreliable? realize 99% of humanity has been religious so again, you're not making sense
@Skeptic_Matt you can't just say they're lying without proving it, if we did history your way we wouldn't be able to do history prior 1850
@Skeptic_Matt yes dismissing people's claims just because they're religious. Thanks for showing you actually are biased and NOT open minded
@Skeptic_Matt truth or all of them were willing to die for a lie, u can dismiss miracles but don't act like you don't carry a presupposition
@Skeptic_Matt the people who wrote the Bible are claiming to have been eyewitnesses and it really happened. So either they're telling the
@Shermertron  yeah I got into it with some of carrier's lackeys, they try to say it wasn't "cheating" but him being "polyamorus" it's sad
@Shermertron @cooperlewis_ well like I said Carrier is charlatan who makes his living on psuedo-history even Ehrman admits Jesus existed
@Shermertron @cooperlewis_ but seriously it's unfortunately what happens when you deny objective morality
@Shermertron @cooperlewis_   He's not cheating he's "polyamorous" you're just a Christian hateful bigot! You're a polygaphobe!!
@shitheadprophet @TheCuggsmeister read Psalm 22. It was in fulfillment of a specific prophecy 1000 before crucifixion was even invented
@Skeptic_Matt they're miracles. Problem with atheists is they act so rational yet refuse to acknowledge their own biases and presuppositions
@Skeptic_Matt well stop spreading disinformation that we don't know who wrote the NT. Of course miracles aren't testable, that's why
@Glen84U 1 of the biggest problems we have today is people compromising the Word to please the world.  I pray you stay strong in His Word
@cooperlewis_ 1.There is no creator 2.natural laws can't be temporarily restricted 3.therefore miracles are impossible
@cooperlewis_ yes we both have presuppositions, problem is the Christian admits it, the atheist pretends he doesn't.
@cooperlewis_ lol what a joke dillahunty is prochoice he literally condones murdering unborn babies any of his opinions on morality are mute
@cooperlewis_ that's presupposing an infinitely powerful God cant restrict laws HE CREATED,if miracles were common they wouldn't be miracles
@cooperlewis_  
@cooperlewis_  I gave you tons of evidence about the reliability of the NT but it comes back to your presupposition: miracles can't happen
@cooperlewis_ yeah that was me pointing out atheists have no justification for morality
@cooperlewis_ this is what happens when the atheist loses a debate, he picks up his ball to go home. Ignoring his biases and presuppositions
@cooperlewis_ and in 1 Corinthians 15:18 he cites a creed that even secular historians admit was from 33-35 a.d
@cooperlewis_ trust the Gospel sources you literally can't trust any ancient book, plus, like you said Paul wrote about Jesus in 55 a.d
@cooperlewis_ again, neither you nor those writers are familiar with ancient history, NT is most attested book of antiquity, if you can't
@cooperlewis_ "scientific evidence"had you studied history youd know you use the evidential method to evaluate history not scientific method
@cooperlewis_ let's just assume they are lying,  then why wouldn't the hostile Pharisees or Romans dig up his tomb to disprove them?
@cooperlewis_ right but most wouldn't be willing to die for that claim, you have eyewitness statements written 5 years after the event
@cooperlewis_ difference is you have dozens of eyewitnesses who were willing to be tortured to death for this. Were they all delusional??
@cooperlewis_ unbelievers alike. If you don't know about the topic then don't talk about it
@cooperlewis_  I've read him its Zeitgeist level conspiracy theories that goes against all sober historical scholarship of believers and
@cooperlewis_ if you're going to claim the NT isn't valid you can't say the works of Homer,Aristotle,Plato, Socrates etc etc are either.
@cooperlewis_ lol Richard Carrier is a pseudo-historian who lives off appealing to biased atheists. Even Bart Ehrman admits Jesus existed
@cooperlewis_ @AtheistRepublic and resurrection, those are the necessary details of the Gospel. The gospels are eyewitness documents
@cooperlewis_ @AtheistRepublic the new testament is the most attested documentary of antiquity. Paul wrote about Jesus' Deity, Crucifixion

@MrPrimate well Hitler, pol pot, mao and Stalin said what they did was morally right, were they wrong?
@cooperlewis_  Read Psalm 22, it was in reference to a very very specific prophecy, 1200 years before Jesus, before crucifixion was invented
@AnarchyArachnid what does pol pot, hitler, stalin and mao all have in common?
@MrPrimate then where do you derive your morality from? How do you justify it?? Or is it all relative and subjective?
@Skeptic_Matt  the New Testament is the most attested book of antiquity. If those authors are anonymous so is Aristotle, Plato, Homer,Etc.

@RickCarrierWiki @Wintery_Knight  reading the Bible we use something called context YHWH NEVER condones polygamy. It's ALWAYS  1 man 1 woman
There is literally no excuse for a straight adult male to be watching the #Oscars2015
@DrOakley1689 Be careful posting stuff like this! Steven Anderson will do a sermon about it tomorrow!
@RickCarrierWiki @Wintery_Knight David also murdered, doesn't mean God condoned it,  polygamy was the downfall of many, especially Solomon
@RickCarrierWiki @Wintery_Knight I know you've never actually read the Bible, but when you do you'll realize God was against polygamy
@DrOakley1689 no worries if you don't know it, anyways, thank you for your ministry youve helped me a ton in answering  skeptics/BartEhrmans
"Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." Matthew 4:10 #Lent
@DrOakley1689 what sermon is that an excerpt from in the Radio Free Geneva from? The second one??
Matt 7:17 "likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit."  Muhammad bore bad fruit, therefore a false prophet
#Jesus: voluntarily gave his life as an offering for  our sins, #Muhammad: poisoned by an elderly jewish lady after butchering her family
#Jesus: rejected having money and taught about the evils of being rich #Muhammad basked in riches and robbed hundreds of caravans
#Jesus: Fulfilled Old Testament prophecies #Muhammad: Misrepresented the Bible and didn't know what it actually taught.
#Jesus: never married #Muhammad: 9 wives including a 6 year old #Jesus: A man of peace #Muhammad: murdered and tortured thousands
#AshWednesday #ashtag  #Lent Satan offered to give Jesus the whole world but like a boss his response was #GetBehindMeSatan I only serve God
Don't forget the reason for #AshWednesday #ashtag and Lent! Our Lord's 40 days in a desert, where He withstood ALL TEMPTATIONS.
What should I give up for #Lent2015 ??
"Jesus said unto them, Verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM" #Jesus was more than a good man, He is #YHWH, the eternal God
21 Christians were martyred by ISIS  but half my timeline is about 2  whores and a transsexual #DontPanic I pray we get our priorities right
"VENGEANCE IS MINE I WILL REPAY," says the LORD (Romans 12:19) #ISIS murdered 21 Christians. Let us pray for #KingJesus holy wrath to come!
@JoelOsteen is a heretic, a pantheist, a false teacher and indeed the wolf in sheep's clothing Christ warned us about!
Thanks for the follow back @MichaelLicona one of my favorite apologists and defenders of the faith! 2 Corinthians 10:5
Years ago the idea of men mutilating themselves seemed beyond insane, yet today it's celebrated. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SUPPRESS TRUTH
"to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie" is what we see today in so called "transsexuals"
Romans 1 tells what happens when we suppress the knowledge of God, and that is what we see,grown men castrating themselves is celebrated.

How can people find Rob Dyrdek funny?
@jmashburn65 It's a post modern world where there's no objective Truth and Morality so people only seek to make themselves feel good.
problem with our generation is our self righteousness. No one wants to admit they're a sinner, liar, adulterer, idolater, thief and murderer
@DrOakley1689 In an interview on Catholics you mentioned 1 debate subject you show no mercy in is abortion,  is there a recording of this?
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
