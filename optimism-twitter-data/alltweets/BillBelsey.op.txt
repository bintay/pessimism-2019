So #Stampeders fans, I know it  sounds weird, but follow @TorontoArgos they're Tweeting in support of @calstampeders &amp; they're great fun!
@sunterryjones  Some are saying the sound system at B.C. Place isn't great, true?
@bruce_arthur Some are saying the sound system at B.C. Place isn't great, true?
@calstampeders I hope the Stamps all come out together as a team, not one at a time.
@calstampeders Cochrane, Alberta #GoStampsGo
@jannarden I think your prediction will be pretty close to the final score Jann. :-) #GoStampsGo !!!
@calstampeders Need to do a roll call before this &amp; other Stampeders' games. Ask where people are watching the game from with #GoStampsGo
@buzrbe @Stampeders by at LEAST 2 TDs
@SGibb1 TY
@SUNMitchell TY
@SUNMitchell So if Joe West is out, does that mean Eric Rogers has his spot?
@DangeRussWilson It's great that you're at the #GREYCUP Even better that your hangin' with a GREAT guy! @randychevrier
@Newstalkstamps While @CFL wants a close #GreyCup game,  @calstampeders talent, coaching, depth &amp; resilience will prevail, by at least 2 TDs
@AlCameronCCA @SchanksNorth @AlLaMonica ;-) #GOSTAMPSGO !!!

In Canada it is now against the law to wear face coverings during a protest, so, would citizens wearing gasmasks be charged? Just wondering.

Another LIVE feed from #Ferguson  
Obama giving a cool, detached professorial speech as the situation appears to worsen. 
Could be wrong, but I think Americans want to see Obama show some real passion over #Ferguson, not to appear so cool &amp; aloof.

@Newstalkstamps One of the main reasons for the @calstampeders success is that they have become an elite learning organization.
