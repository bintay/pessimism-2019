My body may be turning 20 in a couple months but at heart I'm actually turning 8.
Mom made me drive the van to work today because she needs her car later.. C'mon I know you're not leaving the house tonight mom..
S/o to Alec for bringing me a pop that expired in 2012...
Told my mom I wanted a longboard and now she has started researching every possible way one could injure me so I don't buy one..
Today a thirty year old woman's ringtone was talk dirty to me and she wasn't a single bit embarrassed but I definitely was.
Dad is blasting latch throughout the house. BEST. DAY. EVER.
I just want to be able to wear cute clothes instead of the t shirt and athletic shorts I have to wear every day.
I'm tired of everything being a competition with you.
Do you ever care about anyone else's feelings? Like how do you not see what you're doing is wrong?

Finally found my key to my room 2 days after I move out. LOL RIGHT?
Lol at the fact that I've already started packing for when I move back to Iowa city and I haven't even finished unpacking from coming back..
I'm just gonna lay on the floor on top of all my stuff and hope it all gets put away magically

If you ask me if I'm ready for any of my finals, the answer will always be a nooo
When this song comes on while you're studying there's just no possible way to get anything done I'm sorry. 
If you choose to wear pajama pants and/or slippers in public, I will choose to  never speak to you ever.
Probably wouldn't be mad if someone bought me a large pepperoni pizza with some garlic sauce
Does it make me a horrible daughter if I don't post an Instagram of me and my mom today?.. Oh well my mom wouldn't be able to see it anyways

WHY DOES MCDONALDS NOT DELIVER?
@Cottonballzzz yeahh.. Sorry I never told you.. Still friends though right?
Pretty sure that 90% of the people I've met at college don't even know that my real name is christina cause everyone knows me as Tini..
I swear I only have to pee when they're cleaning the bathroom..
definitely starting to get jealous of everyone who's done with school this week.. i just want finals to be over.
I just want to own a suit. No one would have to know that I'm not a business woman.
I wish in chem instead of dropping grades for mastering chem and discussion points I could drop tests cause my test grades are killing me...
Pretty sure I'm going straight to hell for accidentally swearing 20+ times in the note I wrote in my moms Mother's Day card..
@Hadar1094 that's what I thought! Like she should appreciate it and be proud that I actually remembered that Mother's Day is coming up!
Trying to find a Mother's Day card that will casually slip in a "sorry I used your credit card to buy this card.." Without her getting mad..

Told my mom I was at the library for like 8 and a half hours yesterday and she yelled at me.. DO YOU WANT ME TO FAIL COLLEGE WOMAN?!
I was at the library for more hours today than the entire first semester combined.
Depressed because it's just now hitting me that I have to leave Iowa city in less than 2 weeks..
Like can I just be @IGGYAZALEA orrrr?? #girlcrush
The only reason I want to be home is because my mom has some cute shoes that I want to wear but she wouldn't let me take them to school.
If you weren't ugly in middle school and like freshmen year of high school, I officially hate you.
Someone finish my math homeworkkkk<TIRED FACE>
the weather needs to warm up because i have cute summer clothes that need to be worn before i have to wear a t shirt to work every day..
College needs to slow down cause my first year is almost over and that makes me feel super old..
So good to see these guys this weekend<GREEN HEART>

Only piece of advise for you prom goers is DONT TAKE PICTURES IN THE GRASS IF YOURE WEARING HEELS. 
"Isn't her name like margarine or something?" @canttwist
Wow I must've guessed pretty well on my chem test cause I actually passed.
My mom just used the word swag.. I'm going back to Iowa city.
It wouldn't be a trip home without Alec calling me fat.. "do you think you could even fit into your old prom dresses Tini?"
If you have either blue or light brown eyes and have dark eyelashes, chances are I probably think you're adorable.
Oh yeah I'm supposed to be in class right now.. Oops
Can it just be 1030 tonight so I can be done with this test and done for the week?
Instead of actually doing my homework id rather just complain about having to do homework because that's way more fun.
@JordanOlson19 the half of the bag that I haven't eaten yet. Lol

Oh and you can't forget all the hail damage from that hail storm I drove through.. Ahh the memories...
Sometimes I miss my old car even though it had a shark bite, the windows were taped up, the gas gauge broke and pretty much nothing worked..

"Tini have you been doing a lot of that partying in college because I know Iowa is the number 1 party school and all." -my grandma
Going on my second blizzard of the day. #sueme
Looks like my special talent of parking ridiculously stupid hasn't changed a bit.
A 3 year old just asked me if I was a grandma.... This is why I don't go out in public with no make up on.
The best part about not big a car when I come home is that I get to drive everyone else's cars without paying for gas. muahahaha
Still haven't put any of my pictures from prom or graduation on Facebook. I'm only like 7 months behind.
The cat behind Miley&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

@Cottonballzzz you should've told me before cause then I would've stayed and tailgated with you!!!
Alec's rocking the bloutfit. 
Came home to my mom wearing tall Nike socks. Looks like my mom became a baller while I was gone.
For real though guys. My mom made puppy chow today and i want it sooooo bad. I need to be home like now.
Can i just be in humboldt already?
I need pizza.
Cute dog in old capital mall. I repeat cute dog in old capital mall.
Why is there organ music playing in hillcrest?
i am now officially a nuclear medicine interest major! #excited
@canttwist alec! you didn't have to tell EVERYONE that I'm a complete loser!
@haybaybay_13 I'm literally so embarrassed that I'm not even embarrassed anymore.
True life: i pretty much just got attacked by a squirrel on campus..
remember when we used to edit pictures of our friends to have random inside joke sayings on them? like why did we ever stop doing that??....
@CaitlinKohlhaas either that or a mixture between baby talk and total thug gangster person.. or whatevers... ha
what is this language that I'm texting @CaitlinKohlhaas??
seriously though. i love when boys wear sweet watches.
nothing better than changing from a pair of restricting jeans into a pair of extra large jordan shorts.. #socomfy
@princess_carson i forgive you! it was super funny anyways!
I would like to take this moment to do a S/O to @princess_carson for dumping her water on my lap and crotch tonight at dinner.
@ericanlane you can bet your bottom dollar it is. :)
i probably should've made the connection sooner since he was showing us pictures of towns underwater the entire time...
Thought my professor was saying flat and finally at the end of lecture i realized he was saying flood the entire time..
yay! the doctor said i don't have to get a back brace!
Little bit embarrassed that I put a heart in that last tweet.. Makes me feel like I'm in middle school again. Lolzzz
#imweakfor boys that wear glasses. &lt;3

watched a documentary on corn in class today. they talked about humboldt in it and now i just want to go home. i miss seeing corn fields..
@emilycase22 yay!
yes i did just make mashed potatoes in my room. #sueme
lol at the fact that we're supposed to have a majority of a book read by tomorrow and i still haven't bought the book yet.
If you get seconds or thirds at dinner its okay. You just have to switch the section youre sitting in so no one knows.
@Engine1094 @bricarda @emilycase22 @michaelorness11 ian can come as long as he's not super late like the last time.
i seriously hate wearing shirts. i think I'm turning into @Cottonballzzz
@bricarda @emilycase22 @michaelorness11 reunion over the breaks?!
I will make a terrible wife someday.. #hatedishes 
The world should probably thank me for not participating in selfie Sunday.
Homework or a nap? Homework? Or a nap? ..lol why am I even asking myself this question?
I love thunderstorms so much guys.
But what you all dont know is that im wearing tall jordan socks with this dress..
i want it to be summer. summer clothes are so much cuter than winter clothes.
Boys who wear hats at the gym.. Why??
Today I was online shopping for range rovers.. What is wrong with me?!
boys with tattoossss &lt;3
@Hawkeye_Steezy lol I didn't even mean to!
still in denial that I'm in college. i don't even feel like I'm in school. i feel like any day now i should be back working at the pool..
It is completely okay to have multiple pieces of cake if the cake is red velvet. No one is allowed to judge.
Accidentally wore a groutfit to the gym today..
Seriously why are some of the clocks in classrooms not changed yet? That daylight saving shiz was like 2 weeks ago.
Some music that's in some different language is blaring on my floor and theres people singing along to it at the top of her lungs. #wuttt
i hate writing one page single spaced papers because they pretend to be short assignments but really they take forever and a half.
lol just now starting my single spaced paper thats due tomorrow over a book i didn't read.
this is only my second time being in the library.. does that make me a bad student?
i know my parents are going to hate me thanksgiving week because I'm already thinking of all the things I'm gonna make them buy me then..
SCREAM ONE MORE TIME I DARE YOU.
Grandma sweaters! #twinning @princess_carson 
WOW I REALLY WISH THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR TO ME WOULD STOP SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS THIS SERIOUSLY HAPPENS EVERY NIGHT.
@AnnaTecklenburg well i was hoping by the time i drove all the way back to humboldt it would've snowed enough to sled on it.. lol
someone drive me home so i can go sledding down gunders.
I think i missed looking at corn fields. ....Or is that not a thing?
Yesterday my professor had one of the TAs tell us he couldn't make it to class because he was in DC with Bruce Jenner and Kanye... #wut
It's a great day to be alive. I know the suns still shining when I close my eyes.
Backpack is so full right now.. I feel like a turtle. And i probably look like one.

Whoevers load of laundry just got done im giving you 30 seconds before i move all your stuff into a dryer.
@ericanlane yessssssss. :) &lt;3
it should be illegal for hot boys to wear shirts.
i have seriously been sitting in the lounge trying to do homework for the past two hours and ive done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
Of course I would fall and scrape up my knee and hands.. #tiniprobs
Naps and twitter&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homework and studying
would a peanut butter and chocolate frosting sandwich be good? im definitely considering it..
Serious shout out to all my make up providers for making me look somewhat presentable. You da best.
i miss when my entire family would just sit in the living room and jam out to 2 chains and chief keef together..
i can seriously fall asleep anywhere, at any time, in any position.

Trying to nonchalantly cover up my left eye so i can see because my contact fell out in the middle of class...
@csandven13 @bricarda okay! sounds like a plan!
@csandven13 please do!
College kinda makes me feel like I'm on an episode of zoey 101.
Okay. It can stop being cold out now. Lets go back to being hot. Its not funny anymore.
"college is all about learning how to bs stuff.. just do that and you'll be fine." "okay dad.."
WHAT IS A PLANETARY BOUNDARY AND WHY DO I HAVE TO WRITE A PAPER ABOUT IT THIS CLASS IS ONLY 1 CREDIT THERE SHOULD BE NO PAPERS TO WRITE.
lets just live in the moment.
mine and @ericanlane s texts make me question both why dont we have boyfriends and why we would ever have boyfriends all at the same time..
out of my all my clothes in my dresser and closet, spandies are by far my favorite thing to wear.
If i dont cry before, during, or after this test im rewarding myself with ice cream at dinner.
CHRISTINA WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON TWITTER YOU HAVE A MIDTERM IN LESS THAN 2 HOURS.

All y'all are jealous of my dollar sign ice cubes. #dolladollabill 
Me: I don't think that's very appropriate.
Carson: Why?

TOGAS. 
when you go to college, you miss your friends and family way more than you ever expected you would.. just saying.
@ericanlane carpet doesn't get slippery when wet....
But its carpet.... 
Just saw a guy wearing a humboldt wrestling shirt from last year but i have zero clue who the guy was.. How did you get that??
seriously though guys.. i haven't worn jeans to a single class this year.
i dont understand how people can wear real clothes to a morning class. i mean i have troubles getting myself to put on sweatpants..
I seriously dont think i could be more tired than i am right now. #needsleep
im pretty sure the temperature is like -569739999 degrees in my room right now.

Im sorry but i just cant not sleep through that class..
@AnnaTecklenburg @ericanlane  and @emilycase22 and @CaitlinKohlhaas can battle for who gets to be joey!
@AnnaTecklenburg @bricarda YES. but who are ross, chandler, and joey?
@ChubsNelson32 well this is iowa city and maybe he should NEVER wear iowa state apparel here EVER AGAIN unless he wants to get beat up.
Kid on the bus wearing an iowa state shirt.. Do you even know where you are?
bringing back some memories through some now 14.. #missthis
this midterm next week is gonna be real bad. i already know it.
smoked my hip on the doorway. sweeeeeet.
@ericanlane but you did favorite it so INDIRECTLY you said I was pretty. Thaaaaaanks!
indirect insults are my favorite. like "maybe you should go to the gym more.." or "i almost bought that shirt but i didn't like it..."
i seriously live off of granola bars.
say ya'll in an email one more time. i dare you.
@ericanlane awww &lt;3 you too @ericanlane
i miss riding in a car. i just want someone to come pick me up in their car and just drive me around for days.
the second i found that i still had juice in the fridge was the single most happiest point in my life.
Sooo confused.
i like rain when I'm at home and have a car..but i dont like rain when im at college and have to walk places.
Never getting out of bed. Ever.
i swear the custodians just know when i have to go to the bathroom so they just decide to clean it then just to be mean..
I have to run a 5k in less than 5 hours.. Shooooooot.

sometimes i wish i was miley.
my knuckles are all scraped up cause i accidentally punched the ceiling last night..i was just trying to pull my covers up..i was so cold...
Seriously if the ceiling is going to be so close to where I'm sleeping, you could not texturize it so much. My hand is currently bleeding.
when i was writing my paper i wrote "skillz" so i don't really know whats happening to me.
Reminds me of you getting reminded of me. &lt;3 @ericanlane #imdifferent

@CaitlinKohlhaas @haybaybay_13 all i wanted was to get seranaded in front of thousands of jealous girls. is that too much to ask for??
to this day i am still mad that myself, @CaitlinKohlhaas or @haybaybay_13 did not get to be the one less lonely girl..
@ericanlane goodnight

ADVICE: dont ever have one of those middle names on facebook thats not your real middle name. chances are...everyone will hate you.
MY PHONE IS WORKING AGAIN. YAY.
Good thing no one texts me because my phone is broken and I can't text anyone back...
I have a bruise on my face. K cool.
I just need someone to lift me into my bed every night because this whole climbing thing is just not working out for me.
"R-A-D-I-O!"
"What's the matter with you?!"
"So much."

SHE'S THE MAN. @CaitlinKohlhaas

i just want to hang out with my friends and do stupid kid stuff forever.
i don't want to grow up. growing up means paying rent and finding a job and getting married and starting a family. i don't want that yet..
@haybaybay_13 yes and now I'm a little embarrassed... Haha
They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
Yes. My dad does have twitter.
eww im old now.
I JUST SAW RYAN GOSLINGS LOOK ALIKE AND I CANT EVEN CONTROL MYSELF. THIS IS THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.
'i wanna make love in this club' played on the radio of the bus last night and it was awesome.
@CaitlinKohlhaas oh wait.. I don't think I have on of these so called "boyfriends"... I forgot.... :/
@CaitlinKohlhaas your probably right! But it's the thought that counts right?
@CaitlinKohlhaas dang it! my boyfriend wrote it on the wrong college campus!..
Came back from dinner to my room looking like this and a bunch of people singing happy birthday to me!… 
Aren't my friends the best?! #redvelvet #mollyscupcakes carson_bute @lulz594 
Ps I really hate not having a car.
If anyone is going from the Iowa city area to the humboldt area this next weekend, I'm looking for a ride and would pay you for gas!
every time i watch footloose i cant help but shout at @KennyWormald through the tv "WILL YOU MARRY ME?!"
Someone take me back to New Orleans... #nofilter #sunrise 
If EVERY SINGLE PICTURE you have on Instagram says #like or #followme... I probably hate you and won't follow you or like your picture.
Great day to be a hawkeye! #beatstate 
#BeatState #Roomies 
#GoHawks 
If you're in Ames right now and you're going to the game tonight, chances are that I probably hate you because I can't go..
since i cant go to the game ill probably just chill on twitter tomorrow to see whats going on since i know thats all my timeline will be.
when i was younger i always wanted to be the kid at the birthday party that broke open the piñata because that kid is the hero of the party.
If you are a guy and you have an Australian accent, chances are I'm probably in love with you.
my health class makes me scared of everything. todays fear: bed bugs. he said theyre most prominent in residence halls. THANKS FOR THE INFO.
@ericanlane @NickHeider don't you talk when I'm talkin you betta mute it! *holds up remote*
@J_E_6 sooo many of them here..
@J_E_6 you're probably right.. But I think he's okay because I saw him skateboarding around campus later today!
@bricarda yeah it is.
@bricarda every single time I fell involved you.. Or was caused by you...
@bricarda I fell down 5 times that night and even though its embarrassing..I'm kinda proud of it.
@bricarda I have only fallen twice in my three weeks of college so i think im getting better....
EVERYONE HERE HAS IPHONES  AND IM JUST LIKE.........penny phone.
@J_E_6 HA. No.. He was going down a hill and I crossed the street and kinda cut him off and then he tried to avoid me and fell down..
I think i may or may not have just made a kid wipe out on a skateboard.. #Oops #sorry
#myroommateisweird my roommate tells people that I wall twerk whenever I finish a math problem but its really her that does it..
I just want to know my future so I can stop worrying.
@haybaybay_13 ME TOO.
if anyone has an extra ticket to the iowa vs. iowa state game this weekend let me know! I really want to go!
And I'm finally done with homework! ...and by that I mean I gave up..
S/o to the guy in the taylor swift cut off..
Seriously Gabriella? Who wears a white lace dress to a basketball game? #Highschoolmusical3
I wish that the cambus was like Mary poppins' purse so you could fit an unlimited amount of people on it.
My right leg is more tan than my left leg and I'm kinda okay with it.
@Autohead1 And then it made me realize how much I miss you! Hope you're having fun at college!
@Autohead1 met someone the other day that said they'd been to humboldt to a mini golf course and I was like THAT'S WHERE MY FRIEND LIVES.
@LOMackz for me at least..
@LOMackz every day is movie day! Lol
@bricarda thanks bri! I'm thankful for you too! And I'm thankful that you listen to my embarrassing stories about me falling!
@bricarda it's okay! I tweeted this before we talked! Haha
You have no idea how much I want Ryan gosling to lift me like in dirty dancing.. #timeofmylife
I would just like to say that all I have to drink is mini juices and all I want is a 52 oz fountain pop.
I want pickle wrap dip so bad right now.
IT'S CHRISTINITH ARE YOU STUPID OR ARE YOU DEAF
@ericanlane can you just drive down here and bring me a fountain pop? I want one so bad..
@ericanlane please be good things that are reminding you of me..
@ChubsNelson32 if I can find a ride and a ticket!
@ChubsNelson32 I love that picture of us!
Help me I'm poor.
I swear I just heard a cat meow outside my door.. WHO HAS A KITTY I WANT IT.
@haybaybay_13 we should visit each other sometime! :)
@haybaybay_13 at least you're with someone! All my friends here are going to be gone all weekend.. :(
@Engine1094 confession time: maybe I'm not the coolest person on campus.. I know it's hard to believe...
I would just like to say that I went to 4 years of high school football games and not once did chad Michael Murray ever kiss me at one.
I will admit there's more freedom in college except you have no money and you don't have a car handy so there's some restrictions for ya..
Made myself a picnic in my room! It only consists of popcorn... So maybe its not a picnic and I'm just eating popcorn..
Watching wheel of fortune in my room by myself on a Friday night because I'm obviously the coolest person on campus.
I seriously feel so claustrophobic not having a car with me at college. I feel like I'm stuck here and can't ever leave.
I love when we call ourselves the fab five.. @bricarda @emilycase22 @CaitlinKohlhaas @ericanlane &lt;3
@emilycase22 I didn't bring my bike to Iowa city! Too many hills!
Would ya look at that? Eduroam isn't working AGAIN. I hate this wifi so much..
I wish I was going to ceder falls with everyone tonight.. :(
I really want some of @michaelorness11 s moms chicken parmesan.. #bestmealever
@ericanlane noooo people are just idiots.
@ericanlane im still mad.
Only call me Christine if you hope to get a tv thrown at your face.
Fell up the stairs in front of a cute boy.. #ofcourse #tinaprobs
I get real impatient when I order something online and it doesn't come within 20 minutes.
@emilycase22 you're probably right... But I still want one!
Serioulsy guys..my birthday is like in 2 weeks and all i want is a moped. Thats it.
Already almost got hit by a guy on a bike twice and its not even noon..
