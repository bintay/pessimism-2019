@lartist Her! I've been looking into finding that paint. Can you provide with a name or paint type?
Which prompts me to post this, in case any one intends on flirting at me:


Those moments where I'm apparently being flirted at and am completely oblivious.
OMG --- Jamiroquai Game, a game about being Jamiroquai 
@Daffney182 Oh, arrête, j'vais me gêner.
That moment where I don't know if I'm being flirted at or talked to.
I was afraid I'd lost my copy of Ghosts in the Machine. Turns out it was in my library. If you don't have it, get it 
@sokareemie You and me both. #FuckThis
Obvious trigger warning. @AbbyMartin, I hope you're doing well. 
@NoDrNo Adulting. :/
Although having something like Krita with Mypaint's UI would be fantastic.

The puppeteer behind Big Bird had an AMA. The first answer is heart-wrenching.  
@lartist I'd usually do that, but it's an eyebrow that now looks like it belongs to a Klingon! :D
@lartist I'll look up the paint. Thanks!

@oysterFAKE Most logical answer was obviously the most obvious one.
Any tips for covering inking mistakes?

"Oh, hey! Let's give the people who deserve positive attention the attention!" for some reason sounds like a terrible idea online.

Make it a thought experiment: Read Olglaf thinking it's written by a dude.
Patriarchy and defaults and whatnot.
But, for the longest time, I thought it wasn't.
I know it's written by a woman.
I wonder how many people get angry at Oglaf's liberal use of slut?
@sblomkamp I'm willing to change my opinion, if the change makes sense.
@oysterFAKE Holy shit nice!

Fuck it, there's a reason it's called the "Internet Hate Machine", and not the "Let's spread positivity"
That last tweet is probably going to haunt me in a few years.
So, about Joss Whedon...did a bunch of so-called internet feminists turn into Gamergate? 
@PennyRed Well, it did start out as pejorative, and on Tumblr. It was meant to chastise people who go too far in their righteousness.
@NoDrNo Also: It's been too long!
Why did the deer cross the road? #Infinideer 
@NoDrNo There's this quick thing: 
There, I committed my occasional short twitter rant. Shower me with praise or something.
I guess what I'm saying is: Fuck Europe.
It's around the time some of the caliphs tried to become more like the Europeans that we got into the hellhole that's the modern middle east
But no major discriminations.
Wine? Go ahead? Gay. Who cares? Not Muslim? You pay the same taxes as everyone else. No special treatments in the early caliphates.
I see the Daesh act with an intent or reviving the caliphates, without knowing what the caliphates accepted.
It's especially harrowing when it comes from people who ONCE were beacons of acceptance or equality.
And the worst part about all of this is the opposition.
Even something as simple as writing a woman as protagonist is a political action. It's not something that "just is".
You have to be that in as vocal a way as possible so that your voice adds to others denouncing a social injustice.
I mean that anything you are has to be a political stance. You can't just be a minority. You can't just be gay. Or bi. Or genderfluid.
And I don't mean that in a "godlessness is rampant" kind of way.
We live in one of the most technologically advanced yet most morally backwards eras that I know of.

@dislexas They must have /seen/ clothing nonetheless.

@dislexas Layers of clothing: Everything adds to each other.
Whites react in anger when you speak about them.
"Browns" (Blacks, Arabs, Lations) react in anger when they're being insulted and/or killed.
I've noticed a strong disparity in how people react. Specifically: What makes them react.
I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not excited for BvS, or Suicide Squad, but there's hope for Spider-Man.
@sblomkamp It'll probably do like Assassin's Creed and improve with each...I couldn't finish that sentence with a straight face.
Amazing Spider-Man was the story of a bully on cocaine, who went around wanking all over the city.
Man of Steel was the story of a dude bro punching and crashing into things to make them explode. Someone gets to wear a cape.
@TheMidniteFaery @NDGMaxi @RockBand Hot damn! You rock!
The Dark Knight Rises was the story of a man who was sick of doing the same thing and wanted to be done with it. Batman was also involved.

This is taking into account missing issues and some in less than great condition.
I decided to check, just in case. Estimated value, according to market prices: $640.50
So, I had checked to see what the value of my current collection was worth, and I was told "you'd be lucky to get 10$".
It's a win/win situation for me.
While getting rid of Spawn from my life.
On the upside, I could probably make about 130$ right now.

@dislexas Then again, I animated with GIMP, so that's also an option
@dislexas It probably does. I haven't checked yet.
@mechapoetic Cool, then!
@mechapoetic It's more of a genesis controller, so good if you're aiming for that. You'd only be missing the shoulder buttons for Saturn.

God forbid I try to speak about it to people born here, because they can't see the issue.
When you're an immigrant because the land you were born in is being ravaged by forces outside and in, there's no place that feels like home.
I don't feel at home here for so many reasons. But I dread going back because I'm not sure I should be there, either.
One thing people who were born and raised in one country is the incessant feeling that you're never home, even when you are.

C'est le privilège de l'homme blanc d'être incapable de comprendre son privilège.
@Templesmith "Islam" isn't even in their actual name in Arabic. The english name is deceitful in every way.
@alouqa Le terme qu'on m'a donné c'est "straight-queer". Donc...oui?

@IndieGameStand Oh, man. Go get Soul Reaver. You are in for a treat! BOII is considered the weakest entry in the series.
@IndieGameStand Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Shadow of the Colossus, Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time #gaming
@Mighterbump I'm...not sure what that means?
This one’s worth RTing.

I'm still surprised when I see people still give a shit about Spawn.
@MonaAiyed Sounds about right.
@Jumeauxtechno Wow
@SamuelHowitt @AustinCHowe Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets.

@BiellaColeman @jparryhill May I suggest 
@BiellaColeman @jparryhill I actually thought of doing that...
@BiellaColeman @jparryhill Not at all. Although having the right measures would help.

@gersandelf Season 1 was, from my understanding of things, the "Let's get this over with" season.

@srhbutts @redlianak Can I make the bold sugg of trying to talk using audio or video chat? Maybe it'll be easier to keep things focused?
@redlianak @srhbutts One person can't change that overnight. It's easier to attack than to listen. :/
@srhbutts @redlianak Even if you haven't personally, others have. We're in constant straw that beaks the camel's back state here.
@srhbutts @redlianak This is a culmination of things, more than anything else.
@srhbutts @redlianak I believe the implication is that your tweets were used as a reason to get angry at her
@GGDunGood I rather converse than call them a dead eyed robot. @srhbutts @redlianak
@GGDunGood You're not helping anyone or anything. @srhbutts @redlianak
@redlianak @srhbutts Can we agree that twitter is not the best format for long form ideas?
@redlianak @srhbutts That's not what I was getting at, either...
@srhbutts @redlianak That's... not what she's saying...
@redlianak @srhbutts That's not what she's saying...
@srhbutts But people seem to look to you to decide some things. You've become an unintentional leader. :( @redlianak
@srhbutts @redlianak It was in reply to Liana
@srhbutts @redlianak It was a boing boing joke about otherkin which had transphobic undertones..
@srhbutts @redlianak *facepalms* *cries*
@MirandaAdria Very well. Sorry. @redlianak @srhbutts
@InnerPartisan She doesn't know what it was she said. Knowing liana, she would apologize. @redlianak @srhbutts
@SyvSekstini All words are worthless by that logic. @srhbutts @redlianak
@MirandaAdria I'm not looking to dispense approval, and you're free to be angry. But it won't help things. @redlianak @srhbutts
@MirandaAdria This isn't helping. @redlianak @srhbutts
@srhbutts @redlianak Unfortunately, people tend to react. Often harshly. And the faster they can get the information, the faster they react
@redlianak We're stuck in call-out culture. Getting angrier won't help. @srhbutts
@WildGooseBWC You're not helping @srhbutts @redlianak
@srhbutts Pointing out problematic behaviour is understandable, but I think enough damage has been done since august @redlianak
@srhbutts I think it's the fact that some people took it as permission to bully her that's the problem. @redlianak
@redlianak @srhbutts Ok, considering she doesn't think of you as being transphobic, can we try and establish an actual dialogue?
@srhbutts I think @redlianak's angry because some people took your (srh) words as a sign that she was transphobic @;MarkWaid
@srhbutts @redlianak @MarkWaid If I may interject, since this concerns two people I respect...

Just the entirety of #Sworcery's sound design is tremendously fantastic. Everything just works.
I've been meaning to tweet this for a while but: HOLY SHIT THE SOUNDTRACK TO #SWORCERY IS PHENOMENAL

@renaudbedard We're not in Toronto, but we'll hang out with you. Bad, @Seemo!
@sokareemie I've seen bits of S5 when it was airing. I guess binge-watching 4 seasons tired me.
@sokareemie Well, that and the macho bullshit.
@sokareemie And this is why I quit after season 4.
@diezyn Yeah, but she had a LOT. Like raccoon levels of a lot.
@MaieAiyed All I'm hearing is "I ate the croissant and fuck you"
@MaieAiyed I need one. The croissant. You can keep the meeting.
@diezyn Al LOT of eyeliner. Also a Guardians of the Galaxy reference.
@diezyn Once dated someone who had enough eyeliner to attract Squirrel Girl.
@rebheartsyou Yeah, I know. I just need a rest on the shore for a bit. :)
@sokareemie Remember when Mortal Kombat's gore was a silly, silly thing, and not Saw fanfic?
@redlianak You could always moon people and tell them "Not the first time you've seen this", then ride off on a motorcycle?
@rebheartsyou :(
@marqueparunx I'm debating "shut up" and "no"
@marqueparunx Even the soft shit. Yeah, that bad.
@marqueparunx Gave up on that. Makes shit worse.

Two episodes in, I can confirm I like #Daredevil #DaredevilNetflix
@dxzander @dislexas So, what you're saying is: "Quebec is Canada's Mexico"?
@dislexas Our KS video should just be me repeating Soul Reaver + Prince of Persia over and over for nine minutes.
@dislexas Maybe the game looked too "complete" and the KS looks like a pre-order campaign?

@gersandelf Moi aussi! (sans compter que Twitter n'est pas le médium idéal pour ce type de discussion :) )
@gersandelf C'est un peu difficile d'élaborer mes pensées là dessus aujourd'hui, alors j'espère ne rien avoir dit de travers.
@gersandelf ce qu'elles sont vraiment: Des aberrations.
@gersandelf Récurrente dans les cercles moins intellectuellement curieux. Ce qui mène à des aberrations qui ne sont pas traîtées pour...
@gersandelf Y mettre un effort pour changer la dite nature. Malheureusement, il y a mal-utilisation des termes, chose qui est très...
@gersandelf En même temps, certaines phrases (nature humaine), sont supposés mettre en évidence ce qu'on prend pour acquis et, par extension
@gersandelf Potentiellement nuisible, voir destructif, au lieu de s'en occuper.
@gersandelf Certaines phrases sont, de nature, répréhensibles (boys will be boys, par exemple), puisqu'elles mettent de côté un agissement..
@gersandelf Ce qui est moche, c'est qu'elle invalide quelqu'un qui parle honnêtement.
@gersandelf Voir ma réponse à propos des gens dégueulasses. Pour eux: toute excuse est valide.
If I'm going to base my belief on something, and the choice is "What I heard Muhammad say" "The WORD OF GOD", I'll go for the latter.
Many of them self-contradict, and many more contradict the Quran.
It's probably pointless to put it out there, but I basically reject the Hadiths.
@gersandelf Aussi voir "Satire" quand ça ne l'est pas.
@gersandelf Nah, c'est de nature humaine d'être taquin. Les gens dégueulasses, par contre, prennent n'importe quelle excuse pour l'être.
@gersandelf Je me souviens d'un temps où le trolling était innoffensif. Ça n'est plus le cas depuis quelques années.
@gersandelf Je ne sais pas si c'est du trolling, ou juste de la méchanceté pure.
@saladinahmed I was going to add "Sick burn", but that's a double-entendre I'll avoid for now.
@saladinahmed OOOOOOOOOh!

…
@THerwees That's not bad, but might I propose the Bill Hicks/Tool method of fixing LA? 
@keira415 @emaaanc I think it's a response to being colonised: We're brothers because we're stuck at "us vs them"
@HobbyGameDev It's definitely a tremendous influence on #alAkhira. A lot of the background gameplay stuff is influenced by Islam.
@TheQuinnspiracy Bravo! 
"Hey! Mstfa! What are you doing?
- Leading the Muslim World, as one does.
- Cool beans! Wanna play Mortal Kombat?
- Genesis or SNES?"
I think I'm going to start referring to myself as the "Leader of the Muslim World", since it's an apparently arbitrary title anyway.
@mechapoetic :( *hugs as needed*
@IndieGamerChick True, but "a lot of people made a lot of bad decisions" doesn't sound as gratifying to most people.
@imraansiddiqi I love the part about the "Leader of the Muslim World".
I'm starting to get random white dudes coming to explain Islam to me. I must be doing something right.
@DRB300 Their name is DAESH, which has no relation to Islam. Get your facts straight.
@sokareemie Saw that in the early hours of today. (some) good news at last!
With people I've never met.
In a field I never studied.

This is the same "intelligent" logic which lead to "Investigators found a copy of GTA five miles away from the shootings".

Add in the whole patriotic bullshit, especially when it's done in a way that's so offensively backwards you'd think you're listening to...
The reason? Because they were raising the bar of what was acceptable, ant then they went back down.
I used to love wrestling way back then. But, and let's be honest here, there was no way they could re-capture the "attitude" era stuff.
This pretty much reflects what I think of people tweeting about wrestling

I paused a @miakhalifa video to better read her tattoo...I think something's wrong with me.
@ImprobableJoe I know, right? I feel like breaking out into song and dance, now! @freebsdgirl
@ImprobableJoe Watch out, @bashpr0mpt is also a superhero misanthrope, which is like Frank Miller's wet dream. @freebsdgirl
Ordered some transparent Arabic stickers for my keyboard. Initiating the next steps of re-mastering the language.
@palestinienne__ It's a good flag to be.
@Spacekatgal @NoToFeminism My timeline is an interesting thing to witness on occasion. 
@SabieD Ok. Still, I can empathize with the worrying.
@SabieD The fuck? O_o
@sokareemie @bombsfall (I'm sorry) 
I knew Disturbed sucked from a subjective point of view. Now they objectively suck. Fuck off, Draiman. 
WHY DOES THIS EXIST? 
I edited audio and made it sound like not crap. I must be improving or something.
Proud daddy moment: My son uses proper (inverted) camera controls.
@sokareemie ARE THEY? WE NEED TO KNOW!
And then they say there's no such thing as "rape culture".
Universally speaking: the first to cry for freedom of speech are the first to make a rape joke/comment.
@AustinCHowe Anyway, at this point, it's just repeating what we already know.
@AustinCHowe I don't think anyone wants to /have/ to do the same game over and over, which was the issue at hand.
@AustinCHowe He's been saying that since MGS2
@AustinCHowe He had changed his stance on his dislike of making MGS games after MGS4, from what I'd heard.
@ElizSimins I'm fine with a similar routine, I wish the rest of the world would accept this choice.
@gersandelf can you run the following command to see what's causing it?

$ ps ax | grep -i sneeze
@FannieRochefort C'est comme les oeuvres "pour" le cancer. Choix de mots assez manqué.
@FannieRochefort Ça sonne présentement comme un "crissez tout ça au feu" :/
@FannieRochefort Il me semble que "Une loi en aide aux personnes sans revenu" aurait été meilleur.
Best karaoke place in Montreal. GO!
Just putting this out there. 
@sblomkamp I see this as you endorsing me to work for Cracked
@sblomkamp Is it me, or did that advert insinuate that the kid with the blue car caused the crash, like a voodoo car?

Well, shit. RT @LBCI_News_EN: #Netanyahu's #Likud wins Israeli election |
@Quinnae_Moon Satan bless those idiotic assholes.
So...who's going to @MTL_IGF?
#Israelelex 
@rommel_romero And pizza.
@rommel_romero We need to include cool people in this jam.
@rommel_romero We'll have to do a indie dev slumber party (a.k.a. "game jam")
@rommel_romero You mean a "you should sleep" call? hahahaha
@sandchigger @Irmrith @rambie11 IT WAS CHEAPER THAN A HAIRCUT OKAY?
@rommel_romero FRIDAY IS GOOD I JUST DON'T KNOW SLEEP ANYMORE!
@rommel_romero Good-like, mostly. I'll have to actually wake up! :P
@sandchigger @rambie11 We totally are 
@sandchigger @rambie11 
@rommel_romero! We should do lunch soon!
@russpitts Oh, cool. Also: Much love for the Take This project :)
@russpitts Siteground is a pretty good hosting service (if you're looking) :)
@sokareemie This needs to be animated with music from LOTR
If you were looking for a reason to hate Chuck Norris, it's right here 
@gersandelf Did someone mention tea?
@entracte I have considered it, but it would have required me to lose all interest in things I currently like.

@Danielleri Just when I thought you couldn't be cooler, I find out you do Jiu-Jitsu.

@MaieAiyed Let's get you hooked on good tea, to begin.
@MaieAiyed Which explains your (frankly unhealthy) use of Red Bull. Replace that with something else.
@dislexas I was born under bombs, and left the country with that. I still managed some happy memeories.
@MaieAiyed Priorities: You got 'em
@dislexas Considering this was the first...
Scanning old documents. There's a picture of six-year old me happy that I'll be going on a plane. 
#LRT just for the head(less)line.
@marqueparunx I should start a fucking business. :P
@marqueparunx And you missed the target. Like Quebec guys and sex.
@marqueparunx I meant the province.
Have Quebec guys considered actually KNOWING how to fuck?

Just a thought.
Feels like someone's hit me in the back of the head, on the knee, then stabbed me in the back.
@gersandelf I think it was the comic you posted
@MaieAiyed I thought most hockey players looked like raccoons
@MaieAiyed Even after googling, not much of an idea whom that is.
@gersandelf Page not found?
Reminder that this exists (oh and my birthday's coming up in a month)

Hmm, Freedom Cry is available at 75% off, and I did prefer Adéwalé overall...
That moment I'm disappointed because I don't have pics where I could get objectified by @christinelove
@Seemo Definitely sound like it. Although the demo from last year was interesting and pretty.
#LRT: Working on that.
@christinelove @sokareemie FINALLY
There's a pitch night for businesses, but I'm not sure how to pitch "A game where you're the muslim interpretation of Death"
@christinelove @swizzle_kiss Already working on my involvement in this.
@mollycrabapple on supporting friends in any industry (in this case: porn). Beautiful.

@gersandelf BE MORE LIKE TOPH 
@gersandelf ARE YOU TOPH ENOUGH FOR THIS?
@gersandelf ...are you chewing rocks?
@sokareemie Yeah, I know. I'm still trying to understand what he's trying to say.
@ChattyDM That would explain the red dot on my chest.
@sokareemie Uhhhh...? 
And, yes, I did shout "OH, MY GOD" when I saw the list.
OMG #alAkhira will be at @MTL_IGF !
I need to wash my ears from that last tweet 
My son's been obsessing with the Rocky films. Obviously this got stuck in my head 
@christinelove Both. Definitely both.  @swizzle_kiss @sokareemie
@unwinnable @StuHorvath Huh, I wrote a similar article a few months back (in French). Good stuff!

@Fringemtl I got a 'page not found' error...
@dislexas It would be a great idea, if I had two pairs.
@mechapoetic Well, there are a few alternatives, like virtualisation, and you could use FreeDOS instead of MS-DOS, too.
@mechapoetic That might sound nice from a historical perspective, on a technological side, it's a nightmare.
@mechapoetic But it's not quite that simple, because to be properly backwards compatible, it'd have to keep using DOS architecture.

Hmm, do I animate the @studiosLUNE logo today or do I work on the ### calligraphy?

APPLY:

@Irmrith It's in reference to the GG "mascot".
@Irmrith Damn. Didn't notice the misspell. And it's a 50 Shades/GG joke.
@rezaaslan @ZaidJilani I don't think I want to click that link.
Did I win the internet for that tweet?
Christian removed himself from her, and looked into her green and purple yes. He asked:

@tanyaxshort Data analysis of your inbox and Google searches?
@dislexas This is too existential a topic to fit in 140 characters.
Must be because I watched Old Boy again.
Realized I'm feeling strangely small today.
@Irmrith I got that.
@swizzle_kiss @KelvinPut It's basically a DIY VR headset for phones. So if that's what you have, then yep! :)
@Irmrith It's more of a department of "you have to use French, even if it's completely incorrect because we feel threatened by everyone"
@Irmrith Nah, it's more like Canadian bacon, but with an extra helping of self-loathing because it's a good way to be a moron.
@swizzle_kiss You mean Google Cardboard? I recently made one (that's still mostly incomplete but...)
@Irmrith No, they double the dose here. Because there's no bacon like forcefully fed bacon.
@Irmrith You forget: I live here. I'm not exactly canadian. #DownWithBacon
I keep wanting to post intelligent tweets, but I'm all out of "eh"s.
@dislexas Willingness is an entirely different thing than the ability to do anything.

"It's only after we've lost everything..." 
@gersandelf @swizzle_kiss That's pretty much my reaction.
That feeling when you have the right calligraphy... #alAkhira 
Obvious influences are obvious #alAkhira 
@rich_lem @sokareemie @amy_hennig @jmechner @PatriceDez Will do!
$ sudo apt-get install zekr (knowledge)
Oh, we'll be sending out our #NuitBlanche demo in the next mailing list. #alAkhira :)
We really should implement a "subscribe to our mailing list" thing in the next demo.
I should mention we have @TekkaTekkaUntz (middle-eastern electro tribal) making the music for #alAkhira
@sokareemie @amy_hennig @rich_lem @jmechner @PatriceDez I have a press thingie and a working prototype thing (missing features though)
Support us here: 
I'm making a game. It's unabashedly influenced by @amy_hennig, @rich_lem, @jmechner and @PatriceDez's works. It's called #alAkhira
THAT THEME #soulReaver 

"Okay, what do I do in this game?"

"...combat? Probably."
@ElizSimins ALSO: ALL DISCUSSIONS OF MS.MARVEL MUST BE HAD IN ALL CAPS! AND 
@ElizSimins I KNOW RIGHT? KAMALA IS SO AWESOME!
@scroeser And by 'bombs' we mean...um...hang on, I can find a working analogy for this.
Le podcast @laPOM_me va parler de l'événement de la montre Apple dans quelques minutes, pour ceux et celles qui s'intéressent à ça: lapom.me
@retroremakes Material design is nice, so are maps and Google now, and G+'s interface, not to forget Inbox...
@scroeser We have so much of it as is, we may as well just give some away! Think of the starving children.
@scroeser Your answer is perfect.
@scroeser Yay, freedom!
@Polygon Which leaves us with 30 seconds of cinematics in total? :P

I imagine that's why it's called "Windows 8": Because you waste 8 hours on it for nothing.
I love how easy Windows has become. Esp, when after 4 hours of upgrading, it decides that it needs to undo the changes.
Au début, il y avait le point Godwin. Maintenant, il y a le point Sharia.
Should probably hit up Kotaku...
Fine, I contacted KillScreen. Are y'all (non-existing) voices happy?
Maybe Polygon?
I guess I should also contact KillScreen...
On IndieDB: Check. Submitted to MIGF: Check. Contacted RPS: Check. Should also post to TIGSource while I'm at it... #gamedev
@gersandelf Folk Goth?
@Deabela For a lot of people, ethnicity = skin colour, because it's a simple (if flawed) association.
@Seemo Define "broken"?
@bad_dominicana Well, I did write about this very topic a few days back 
@bad_dominicana People's perception of the middle east is that "it's all arabs", as if no one ever travelled around those lands.
Damned hurdles created by the lack of being incorporated!
@dislexas It's the sane thing to do.
Seriously, thanks to @tha_rami and @Vlambeer for making it easier for indies to have press kits!
Welp, I've just submitted #alAkhira to @MTL_IGF!
@dislexas Still, it's more realistic to ask for 6 months, while mentioning what would be needed for 1 year.
@dislexas We could splurge the money on frivolities like new clothes or dental work!
Maybe the #alAkhira KS should concentrate on making hummus?
Also, my reading of Arabic is improving.
In other news, I've went through the expected budget, and it looks like we'd need half of what I thought for 1 year of dev on #alakhira
We're now live on @IndieDB! 
@JimSterling How do indie devs get in touch with you with regards to discussing their game?
@ClawhammerMark Don't we love it when this happens?
@dislexas But of course!
Want to own some cosmic art made with food stuff?

Right this way... 
Looks like I'll soon need to make a #ThisIsSparta animation for the Studios LU/NE FB page!

@oysterFAKE The next-gen OpenGL spec 
@gersandelf The picture says 'yes', but I can't confirm until my TARDIS allows me to do so.
@oysterFAKE More or less. I'm really hoping Vulkan is adopted quickly in some game engines.
@oysterFAKE @Kotaku Valve's, I imagine.
@anne_theriault Should I send them a pic of my back? #SoMuchHair
@oysterFAKE Yeah, and it's F2P, to be distributed by EA
Ok, installing presskit() was REALLY painless.
@SaraJBenincasa That's a typical day anywhere there's a request for questioning of genocidal behaviours.
@IndieGamerChick I'm making note of this for future reference. (will also contact when we get around to this)
@Sonic9jct @IndieGamerChick Already following, so that's a start.
Getting around to installing presskit(), how easy is it to integrate with a Wordpress site? /cc @tha_rami
So I'm now mentally elaborating the idea of being kink/queer friendly and Muslim, and how they're not mutually exclusive.

@mechapoetic It was at that moment that I knew I loved Dax.
It has come to my attention that Spock liked big butts. And since he's a Vulcan, he cannot lie.
Fucking legendary, man. \\//,
What if Leonard Nimoy gave us one good day on the internet as a final gift?
And made that dress?
What if he freed those Llamas?
Hang on...do you think it was Leonard Nimoy who was the deciding vote for Net Neutrality?
@dislexas It was mainly adding collitions to things like trees and rocks and an exit script, but...yeah.
That thing where you're trying to write an email to promote/discuss your game and you don't know what tone to use?
Realizing that I'm uploading a build of the game but I still want to add things... #gamedev
@mynameisntdave Ah, the Facebook method.
In other news: Prototype builds for #alAkhira are being uploaded as we speak.
Objectivism has nothing to do with "being objective". FUCKING LOOK IT UP 
Seriously: If you're going to criticize @leighalexander, you should at least have the decency to KNOW what you're talking about.
You say that word, but I don't think it means what you think it means... 
@anne_theriault That said: "A Vulcan in the streets, a Vulcan on Pon Farr in the sheets."
@anne_theriault I love you for verbalizing that.
