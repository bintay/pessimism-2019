@SleeveNotes and i, post the election, are delighted that 1984, orwell's utopian dream, is returning to london.

the greens are cassandra. all the best arguments, clear view of the future - but pathologically unable to get anyone to listen. #oresteia
odd 'thing we need' on the list this morning: child's drawing of two eagles ripping apart a pregnant hare. #oresteia
trying to think of an election outcome that wouldn't be profoundly depressing.
pina bausch shows: petrol stations where you fill up your dream tank.
anyone want to buy a property from a professional who can't spell professional? 
though i think the powers that be must agree. that sequel they talk about at the end? never actually appeared.
dramaturgically, easter's a bit too 'hollywood ending'.
i see a mention of joni mitchell on here and i get terrified she's died. the world really can't spare her. there has to be more work to come
@chris_shinn and so we therefore think of 'darkness' as a new arrival; not as something that belonged to the past.
@chris_shinn maybe bcos we lived through the sharp drop from optimism/security in 1990s into world post-9/11 - so we look back in nostalgia?
'it was so much darker than i thought': all directors, ever, on classics. it's like we travel in a permanent state of optimistic naivety.
@ilendahill #married 
it turns out that 'i'm in the mood for dancing' has two fucking great key changes in it. one of them is even downward.
exactly @lyngardner 
today's 'failing humanity award' goes to david cameron, who thinks jeremy clarkson is a 'huge talent'.
thoughts with all @battersea_arts - horrible news full stop but several times worse for the guys who (make) work there. but it'll be bac(k).
terry pratchett, gone too soon; for a man who gave so many hours of pleasure to so many, you only wish time had made repayment in kind.
then james macdonald's #Bakkhai and @rupertgoold's #Medea - and as part of festival we're doing loads of other stuff too. #AlmeidaGreeks
and finally it's out! my next production is the great lia williams in big fat greek 'box set' #Oresteia 
inspired by the seating plan of the olivier theatre. (real product). 
biggest announcement so far @AlmeidaTheatre tomorrow...
this is excellent. properly excellent. 
here's how i like my intervals: plural or none. the unevenly bisected evening is so 1990.
so on 'great british...' bake off rip offs, which UK stereotypes are left to reali-tv-ise? rain? politeness? football hooliganism? empire?
defining success in £ gives theatres clear, measurable feedback in a moribund critical culture. but: artistic innovation in £ = failure.
if this week was a boiled sweet there would be real pleasure in spitting it out and stamping it into oblivion.
the ideal critic is someone with all the instinct and ability to make the art, but (unbitterly) no desire to.
well @serial is brilliant: terrifying, chaotic, wide, wide open.
though today's evidence for the existence of god: russell brand's surname.
today's 'failing humanity award' goes to prospect magazine, who have named russell brand one of the 'world's best thinkers'.
message to old blue-trousered man who shouted in the face of a 11yo girl for filming concert: feel free to die early. we can use the carbon.
rattle and the berliner philharmonic and five sibelius symphonies: epic &amp; swirling &amp; inhale-exciting two nights in a row @BarbicanCentre.
theatre attendance rises by 1% while box office income rises by 5%: worrying: it's the wrong way round.
@DuskaRados and the removal of the artist's biography from the conversation unless the artist has put it there
@DuskaRados fewer pompous judges &amp; more guardians of a higher standard - of innovation, rigour, execution - &amp; of making neck hairs stand up.
in 2015, advertising is like sugar: in everything, everywhere.
#TheFever has passed.
odd that today we fetishise new narratives - and forget that adaptation/evolution was what the big guys did. #shakespeare #greeks #kubrick
people who say theatre is nowhere near being a dead art form: the ones most likely to kill it.
tiny handful of tickets available for @TobiasMenzies in #TheFever - tonight and tomorrow night. last chance! 
ok, audiences, just to be clear: depicting something doesn't mean you endorse it. nor does depicting it forcefully / emphatically.
great #AlmeidaQuestions @AlmeidaTheatre tonight: thank you @selina_todd @OwenJones84 and @DPJHodges for a brilliant, heated discussion.
@AlmeidaTheatre tonight: @selina_todd @OwenJones84 and @DPJHodges discuss whether it's all about the money. £3! #TheFever #MerchantofVenice
wally liked it. @TobiasMenzies and @RebeccaCHill and I and all of Team Fever delighted by this fact. #TheFever
basically everyone was right and BIRDMAN is totally worth two hours of your life.
BIRDMAN also captures the zeitgeist on the fetishism of the artist's biography, on weak critical culture &amp; on the new-media celebrity virus.
BIRDMAN merciless on egotism of artists, of critics, of social media - &amp; profound on how hard it is to hear anything amid all the voices.
detail from the set of #TheFever 
to all asking about #TheFever tickets we've had returns every night this week, so very good odds of seeing it if u queue @TheMayFairHotel
exhilarating week. thanks to our brilliant #TheFever team &amp; to the great @TobiasMenzies - doing something v difficult with soul and grace.
finally made it into a hotel bedroom with @TobiasMenzies. and got the photo to prove it. #thefever 
as a whole, there are flaws (ie pete campbell) but some single episodes of MAD MEN are up at the SOPRANOS high water mark for completeness.
actually just looked for a 2x speed setting on the bluray player to see if we could get BREAKING BAD to feel less slow. there isn't one.
@RebeccaCHill @Lauren_LaRocque ffs ALL assistant directors are just obsessed with lauren la rocque
'i'll just check the room - sometimes our guests leave very peculiar aftermaths... look, whatever you're thinking of, it's happened.' #hotel
'this show contains smoking'. theatre is silly but the world more so: someone's spent time on theatre smoke but we can't fix climate change.
an artist's age, weight, build, biography: if you're reading about these, you're likely not reading good enough criticism. #reviewthework
if you haven't yet, you've got just over a week to catch OUR TOWN @AlmeidaTheatre. you won't regret it: it's (several times) a surprise.
THE SIXTH SENSE: delicate, internal but then bruce willis' acting hits it like a rock hits a china cup. schwarzenegger cast as carl jung.
apparently myleene klass just beat ed miliband in an argument. or it could just be hearsay.
today was the day of two baileys: old &amp; christopher brett. death as forensics &amp; then as linguistics. mind-expanding, both.
i'll be honest i am pretty worried about card clash
plans for my future production of MUCH ADO, starring richard &amp; judy, continue. in the meantime, here's richard's CV: 
isn't the whole thing supposed to be about NOT focussing on what women/feminists look like?
a review of russell brand's book with rigour after its own fashion: not having read it,my uninformed opinion is it's a waste of paper &amp; time
it'll displease theatre conservatives but belvoir's THE WILD DUCK is gripping, urgently contemporary and razor-sharp. ibsen lives, for once.
heading to cambridge to catch the #1984play team on their last day of touring airstrip one.
great to see the #1984play team smashing it in a full @ExeterNorthcott. don't miss yr last chance to catch the show: a week and a half left!
what jamie oliver does to the english language is what soap does to bath bubbles.
well, i've had all these human rights for ages and if i'm honest i barely use them so i can see their point.
shows like speed the plow expose the difference between the commentators desperate to be the event and those there genuinely to describe it.
and that's it, signing off- thanks for all questions. hope you enjoy it if you're seeing it later in the tour. #1984play
@HeadlongTheatre #1984play it's grown with them: e.g. three brilliant, very different parsons in @gspok @SimonCoates_ and @georgepotts1974.
@georgefjohnston #1984play brecht thought it could. i don't know. it certainly tries often enough, but i'm not sure successfully.
@georgefjohnston #1984play it can stir the pot - tho it's not didactic. winston's right about surveillance (anti), but so is parsons (pro).
@georgefjohnston #1984play i can't imagine people going to a horror movie and then being astonished and appalled when it's scary. (2/2)
@georgefjohnston #1984play it's odd that we expect theatre to be polite at all times: even when you book for 1984. (1/2)
@georgefjohnston #1984play not at all: theatre isn't for them! though as a matter of record, they have fainted and continue to faint.
@georgefjohnston #1984play i always want theatre to feel urgent &amp; in the same room as the audience. not something quiet happening over there
@Kate_Rayner1 #1984play there's not a message; we want them to go out feeling shell-shocked and thinking loads. (ideally for about a week.)
@UneFilleParis #1984play #MrBurns i find ralph wiggum almost impossibly funny. yours?
@HeadlongTheatre #1984play well, it's still, you know, bad but it could be worse. but i think i thought that before.
meant to say that i'm now online answering any 1984 questions - fire them at #1984play
@CambsEdition #1984play .. creates a hazy world in which nothing (information, language, state) can be trusted as 'real'. true? (2/2)
@CambsEdition #1984play if you mean politically / technologically, really hard to know where orwell stood - i suppose for me the book (1/2)
@UneFilleParis #1984play well, i think that'd probably be telling. but i think it's big idea books that are most theatrical: not naturalism!
@Mateo_Oxley #1984play thanks! how black and blue?
@Kate_Rayner1 #1984play i think it's always more than one thing. could equally be a successful terrorist-sting remembered.
@FanFairweather #1984play great question! in terms of ideas, maybe old testament god? (well-written though).
@FayeLJohnson #1984play brilliantly handled rats from EAB Animals, that have got better as we've gone on. we work with children AND animals.
@Kate_Rayner1 #1984play i don't think i have an answer to that...
@Mateo_Oxley #1984play language. newspeak. - i could go on! also we v much wanted it to punch you in the stomach, just like the novel does.
@Mateo_Oxley #1984play all of it! doublethink. subjectivity ('reality is inside the skull'). surveillance. austerity. the appendix.
@CambsEdition #1984play but we were helped by a) great, complex, source material and b) total freedom from the estate to adapt as we saw fit
@CambsEdition #1984play which led to a rethinking of the theatre conventions - scene changes, doubling etc. - to match orwell's structure.
@CambsEdition #1984play @SleeveNotes &amp; i tried to adapt the whole structure of the novel, not just one slice of it, which was a challenge
which is testament to his show - &amp; to where our theatre is stuck: that is, shivering anarchic excitement shouldn't be an anomalous surprise.
touching sense that the elderly theatre audience were genuinely refreshed and excited to be pulled into the show by ostermeier tonight.
new referendum idea: how should england pronounce the word 'croissant'?
so 'you can do it seriously or as a comedy'. we do neither. having now seen the comedy version, it really isn't that funny.
this by @mrdavidjays on #LittleRevolution is brilliant in its own right &amp; gets to the heart of why we programmed it  
it occurs to me that i am only ever an inth away from being robin thicke.
hard not to feel that the yes campaign is back-of-envelope thinking, 'change' w/o detail: preserving the problem &amp; making other stuff worse.
the scotland debate exposes how much we've come to hate westminster - magnetised to anything that might unseat politicians: 'yes to change'.
very excited and proud that we're announcing great new @AlmeidaTheatre season #MerchantofVenice #TheFever #Game #CarmenDisruption
(swooping Edith Evans voice) 'We-ll it's not La Traviata, is it?' #interval #heardattheNT
final week of #1984play in the west end.
this is just pure, pure joy. the idea, the soundbites, the 'celebrity', hashtag #ilovetrains. watch it and cheer up: 
'We never shall have any more time. We have, and we have always had, all the time there is.' ARNOLD BENNETT
oh captain 
boyhood - understated/whelming. nothing about its execution ever matches the profundity of the idea: which i bet will be really influential.
heading to note #1984play west end, where it completes its run in less than 3 weeks, my bus from almeida passes the bells of st clement's.
one year ago today we started rehearsals for #1984play. incredible, committed work from a big (and growing) family of party members.
and #MrBurns... this is the part where we say goodbye. but you're not leaving, you won't go away: you've just become a story we'll re-tell.
thank you to the whole committed, gifted, glorious #MrBurns cast, creatives and company for everything. nice one, team. job well done.
coming to #MrBurns @AlmeidaTheatre this friday? @dan_hutton and i are doing a free Q&amp;A post show. &amp; last under-30 cheap tkts now on sale.
elaine stritch. worthy of the word legend: instincts of steel and sang rough, imperfect, broken but always the heart of it just roared out.
&amp; six weeks more of #1984play in the west end if you're yet to join the party. equally proud of that crack team: show has never been better.
only two weeks left of #MrBurns @AlmeidaTheatre - and then it stays away forever. very proud of it &amp; of brilliant, brilliant cast.
ben folds at barbican: explosive, jazzy &amp; a movingly uneven new piano concerto - bursts of pop leaping up to reach for this grand old form.
adler + gibb @royalcourt is like a 2014 pirandello play: a serious-playful, casually formal, real-ly theatrical record of life and liveness.
moving to watch 80 @AlmeidaProjects kids respond to #mrburns. their doomsday diagnosis: money'll cause it &amp; we'll miss our phones the most.
@jennarusselluk just be very careful when you're singing that you've been alive for 100 years. 100 is way past @wunmo's limit... #harvest
@MPShaeffer @JustineMitchel2 you're over 40? @wunmo will take it from here #harvest
@MPShaeffer @JustineMitchel2 congratulations! you have won the Middle Class Sentence Medal of Honour!
also, this song is on the radio: 
it's sunday. and i couldn't be prouder of our exceptional #mrburns team @AlmeidaTheatre: an exhausting, exhilarating week.
song of the day as the #mrburnsplay team move into the theatre, this: 
@jennarusselluk @AlmeidaTheatre ...god is always handy
guy on #bbcqt will vote for a politician that resembles him. his doctor should be forcibly chosen on the same (no-skill-involved) criteria.
someone's got a very general sense of racial politics in @waitrose... 
finally caught view from the bridge: miller's play stripped clean, down to a steel backbone - and unlocked in the process. van hove: master.
crazy preacher woman on train talking about jesus very loudly. apparently god is coming for the sinners. commuters seem unmoved by this.
it's a tiny gesture, and in an age of such worthless politicians, getting even tinier; but voting still feels quietly necessary.
ed miliband sounds like his tongue has swollen up in his mouth - and he's really worried about it but trying to sound calm.
you can tell a lot about someone's self-image from the clothes they wear to exercise.
deep excitement as team '84 tech #1984play @ThePlayhouseLDN, just up the road from st clement danes. it's already feeling like home.
thrilled at the @AlmeidaTheatre haul and especially for the brilliant lucy kirkwood and lyndsey turner #OlivierAwards
so it turns out that the real batman was not bruce wayne, but an edwardian woman. that is one committed disguise. 
knighthoods/damehoods all round after first preview of #KingCharlesIII @AlmeidaTheatre. a new mike bartlett play is a real event.
nick clegg: not even persuasive when we know he's right.
highlight to meet with a bracingly inspiring ivo van hove @AlmeidaTheatre this week. he's the director who sets the bar at the moment.
warm night, window open &amp; in drifts the faithful old west wing theme tune from another flat. i'd like to think it's their very first episode
it started @SkyMirror, toured the country &amp; now our almeida 1984 is to hit the west end. nice work, team #1984play. 
The article stated that Bradley Manning took Ellen’s selfie. In fact, it was Bradley Cooper. This has been corrected. 
the big silver-jawed safety curtain @BarbicanCentre and their end of aisle automatically-closing entrance doors have got magic in them.
thrillingly nostalgic tonight to be back with @ellahickson 's BOYS after all this time. they've aged pretty impressively.
boris and bob crow. another moment of looking at politics and realising that it's now populated neither by the brightest nor the best.
end of a great week getting this Party re-started in the #1984play rehearsal room. #makeitlast 
ringtones seem now only to be used by people aged 50+. maybe because only they get that you don't have to hold/look at yr phone all the time
v sad to hear abt simon hoggart: lovely guy &amp; an incisive, genuinely funny writer of light-touch genius. saturdays will never be the same.
emotionally full, epic form, messy, entirely alive and burningly contemporary. shax as it should be; the way you dream it. #romantragedies
'it's scenes from a marriage'. level one: 
'i just wanna be the girl you like'. beyoncé knowles, new album. profound feminism, apparently.
the word 'gnat': badly designed. not suitable for impassioned comparisons.
waiting; posh receptionist channelling bernard (e.g. 'al-LEA-way' and making vehicle a three-stress word). 
von hove's scenes from a marriage - wildly respun into forensic, naked clarity; yes, uneven, overlong, but: the direction. the direction.
..&amp; big love my @HeadlongTheatre family: it's been emotional. &amp; finally @SleeveNotes - he's undoubtedly one for the future (&amp; the unborn).
&amp; special thanks to two of the best regional theatres for making a 2nd visit feel like a homecoming: @LivEveryPlay &amp; the mighty @SkyMirror..
massive thanks and love to all of the #1984play cast &amp; crew for such a phenomenal ride making UK tour '13. see you @AlmeidaTheatre in jan.
she also, with characteristic irony, wd suddenly use a lock-n-load super-soaker to stop her house cat (r. burbage) from scratching the sofa.
anne was an brilliant, exacting, inspiring teacher who wore her genius very lightly -&amp; her lessons were exactly what i'd hoped uni would be.
very sad to hear about the very great anne barton, 'whose every work.. came forth example and remains so, yet' 
this: 
#propstable #1984play 
now he's talking about the EDC sector. means 'everyday chocolate', which you probably won't have known. he knows that.
a snickers employee is bragging on tube about what he knows. apparently the coming-next-year snickers 'more nuts' has only one more peanut.
hugely excited to be associate director @AlmeidaTheatre but sad to be leaving family @HeadlongTheatre &amp; grateful for 3 unforgettable years.
i love the NT. my birthday wish for it: that, for the next fifty years, it defines its success in boundary-pushing on-stage art, not in GBP.
surely the dying Steve Jobs designed iPhone batteries like this to embody a truth: life is short - and it's gone when you've barely started.
previously on #1984play: vomiting audience members, latent pirates, escaped rats, low bar-setting, and the pleasures of postcard collecting.
what is the virtue of tiny little water glasses?
the alphabet-code pricing system in greetings card shops is a layer of extra complexity the universe just doesn't need.
great company meeting, a train ride, and now feeling the #1984play withdrawal: first performance i haven't been there for. #stillwatching
overheard: man, 50s, red trousers, nottingham: 'you can do 1984 as a comedy or do it seriously. but THAT was NEITHER'. #quoteoftheweek
huge thanks @SkyMirror, HL, @rupertgoold &amp; our great cast and creatives. opening my final @HeadlongTheatre show has been all Party #1984play
you know a show has really got to theatre-tories when they state their indifference with white-hot rage. 'it WASN'T shocking. just BORING'.
@mrbenpower @Postcards_Gods @rupertgoold every selection box needs the bounty.
2013: the year of 1984.
it must be terrifying inside his head: 
someone on tv just compared dr who to six feet under. it's much, much closer to the blue peter end of the spectrum, no?
the thing about solo shows is that you need a soloist who's really worth a whole show all to themselves. andrew scott: worth it. #seawall
you know the 1% of theatre that's so brilliant it's like swimming in the ocean &amp; reminds us why we do it at all? feels like we're due one.
which somewhat undermines my own sense of my own 'taste'. though so does the existence of film/book/theatre 'guilty pleasures'. not guilty..
sometimes i think i just like work that feels like a distillation of years of someone's determination &amp; will &amp; soul &amp; thought. #francesha
dramaturgid [adj.] : (of theatre) dull as a result of following rules too often/closely (see also 'too many cooks' and 'rule by committee')
by the way, if that last tweet was the first you'd heard of biscuit spread, you're welcome.
so, this person may have the world's least creative mind: using biscuit spread in a new recipe... to make biscuits 
whoever thought up rice pudding. that's the kind of out-of-the-box maverick creativity we should all aspire to.
baz luhrmann: inspiringly brilliant at basically everything except picking actors #thegreatgatsby
erlend øye of kings of convenience, mid-concert on weds: 'life is full of terrible moments. this isn't one of them.' 
retweeted theatre praise: twitter junk mail. rt-ed national review: pizza flier (1% might just use it). rt-ed audience review: just litter.
'grandad, tell me about the day in '13 when you and 100s like u sent a searing political message to the govt. by buying something on itunes'
our generation will be looked back on as the ones who thought voting a song into the top 40 genuinely counted as actual political protest.
i don't like what she stood for, but yes to politicians who stand for things - this govt., focus-group mediocrities to a man, don't compare.
huge, crazy &amp; explosive, rory mullarkey's CANNIBALS bursts into theatre world like a giant. it's great - as is @mrmrlonghurst 's production
madmen: painstakingly brilliant - only how was pete campbell ever cast? it's like a gold necklace studded with 30 diamonds and one coco pop.
to name but a few
effect, lungs, crimp, l.williams, longhurst, scutt, b.andrews, rickson, v.kirby, k.o'flynn, gatz &amp; shepherd, 3kingdoms, nübling #olivierrors
#mockingbird @rxtheatre is a very classy bit of staging by @maxedenwebster, in which the extraordinary @_Tarbs just takes flight #2towatch
this is really excitingly brilliant - as it was in the flesh: fast, sharp, funny, conscious. 
.@O2 customer service: so poor it can only be run by somebody with a profound, world-weary sense of irony. suggested slogan: O2 - GO2Hell.
very odd when train passengers queue 5m before kings cross - like they're getting ready to spring out the window &amp; sprint down the platform
haven't read #Mormon reviews but given that it's a) not boring, b) not traditional &amp; c) brilliant, it'll be a miracle if the critics like it
admittedly i saw it a year ago, but #BookOfMormon remains quite genuinely the funniest thing i've ever seen in a theatre.
watch-watching: looking around you during a theatre show to see if someone near you has a visible watch
&amp; aristocratically shushing the laughter/gasps of a school party. maybe they expected PORT (AND CHEESE), the sequel to COCKTAIL STICKS (2/2)
to PORT @ the NT. kate o'flynn is transcendent and as great as everyone says. unlike the NT's jurassic audience, furiously murmuring.. (1/2)
@lucyprebblish @tomscuttdesign seconded. it's inspiringly brilliant.
proud of @zaratw, @simoncoates599 and @gemmabodinetz, all of whom, i am reliably informed, 'smashed it' tonight #puttingtheyeahinmoliere
13 strikes, and it's out #warispeace
@rupertgoold ... you're LEAVING?!
if we stop this 'humiliating U-turn' stuff on gove, we teach osborne that it's good to turn round when you're blatantly facing the wrong way
take a pile of antique furniture. decorate with 1990s celebs. pour over a rainy, confusing version of tale of two cities. add songs. #lesmis
so the nobel prize was to atone for nobel having invented dynamite. richard curtis invented comic relief - and love actually. #snap
say what you like about the complexity of his politics, but tarantino's sense of rhythm and cartoon-audacity make their own arguments
well, i was wrong about beyonce. i thought she'd exhausted the ways to be simultaneously fake and mediocre. #bookapropersinger
someone should make sure they don't do sugery on anyone #eyefordetail 
anyway, what's the point in dramatising tolkien when this is still available? 
#thehobbit is inconsistent and overlong. and like so much rushed-out commercial stuff, it just doesn't know what film it's trying to be
@gemmabodinetz The Director's Crafty
crimp's 'in the republic of happiness': audacious, toxic, dazzling, deep-thinking. like a crystal boiled sweet with a petrol filling.
catholic taste, @dictionarycom 

#recessionbritain 
effect; affecting; effective #headlongpride
posh old woman: 'i loathe the CIA. it's the most immoral institution there is' #overheardattheinterval #theatre'sdyingaudience
&amp; #theeffectplay is like surgery by @lucyprebblish : forensic, intelligent, essential: ups your heart rate and makes your world feel better
we've got major @HeadlongTheatre work out at the moment: mike bartlett's 5* #medea (on a UK tour) is lightning in a 90m bottle...
hallowe'en. only reason to be terrified for your life is if you're an apostrophe.
in other art news, i found this (mainly his face while dancing) genuinely hilarious: 
ended up staying for 90m amidst THESE ASSOCIATIONS (Tino Seghal) @Tate. like life in london but with eye contact.
execution: good. scenes: less so.
overheard. US woman at the royal court, confidently: 'there are very few incredible musicals' (pause, her friend nods) 'showboat is one...'
very very, in fact. 
and while i'm on social media, mike bartlett's antisocial medea is like a great big reviving electric shock straight to euripides' heart
“If you have tickets for A Day of Pleasure please note it has been postponed until next year” #accidentallyreflectsthespiritoftheage
future diarists will name-drop with 'got an e-mail from..' and not 'got a card from..' - and somehow that feels like a loss. #RIPhandwriting
brilliant. 
projection time
they must put something in the air con at M&amp;S that interferes with pensioners' navigation and spacial awareness
for those in need of joy, watch this: 
sometimes 'relevant' modern shakespeare feels like when yr uncle says 'fizzy pop' or 'half-caste' - and the culture gap is suddenly an abyss
even a bad musical can prob - for a moment at least - make your heart boil over. it's a rare actor that can do it with just words
best songs in musicals: sung by the male protagonist's friends - usually bemoaning/celebrating the status quo. #krupke #brushup #badbadnews
#deadeconomy 
if you're in edinburgh this summer, and like your comedy funny-ironic rather than obvious-forced, go and see @pattiebrewster. she's great.
#HeadlongORL quote of the day: 'retreats are the way forward'
after a late-night roundtable with mike bartlett last night, today the writers are writing. #HeadlongORL is underway.
glad i was warned #thekillerswithin 
there's nothing you could do to boris that i would consider inhumane #Olympics
...and then #Gatz was subtle, unshowy magic: waves of atmosphere gently transforming the stage. and what a performance from scott shepherd.
good theatre week. #TheMatchBox @LivEveryPlay is an excoriating, unstoppable production, like white-hot bleach inevitably coming to boil...
and the critics calling 'the newsroom' arrogant and smug are pots calling the kettle black. only the kettle can, you know, actually write.
anyone who thinks the sorkinisms video  diminishes sorkin needs to read shakespeare and sophocles. they're just as guilty. of musicality.
keep thinking about ten chi. this bausch season is the cherry atop an amazing barbican programme: von hove, ostermeier, gross und klein...
'always have your bags packed'
but if you don't run 'cause you think it's gonna be too hard or you think you're gonna lose - well, god, jed, i don't even want to know you
@SUSUtheatre yes - v different. more group work, fewer solo calls; much more improv; and oddly much less music in rehearsals 4 #boystheplay
@SUSUtheatre it's a collaboration, so hopefully both visions are clarified and distilled until they eventually reflect each other
@SUSUtheatre massively. it's a completely different play now, in all sorts of ways: @ellahickson and i have come a long long way together
@LambiePete thanks pete.
@SUSUtheatre yes: @ellahickson. had been determined to work with her and get her handcuffed to headlong. she's a genius. #boystheplay
@AlisonCookie yes they would - but they're a bit of a theatre cliche - and they'd get in the way of the lights hitting the set! x
@SUSUtheatre the list is endless, but here are five: ivo van hove, ostermeier, rickson, charlie kaufmann, oscar peterson #boystheplay
@ecollyerbristow exactly the same as on #starxlovers - getting people young enough and talented enough #boystheplay
@LambiePete sure, but really great popular work (like billy elliot the musical or enron) can educate/provoke/entertain all at once...
@SUSUtheatre i'm doing a new production of THE ALCHEMIST by ben jonson @LivEveryPlay in september; and then more nxt year!
@SUSUtheatre cultivate patience. know what direction is. watch gr8 conductors and f-ball managers. see plays. listen to music. stay up late.
@LambiePete no, just a hard tool to use properly - and which needs to rediscover how to be a popular art form again
@danieltnraggett a dead kitten: initially it looks cute, but get involved and it's pretty bleak #boystheplay
@Henny_Finch less for the drugs &amp; drink &amp; destruction than for the occasional moment of total bleakness &amp; the feeling of 'what is this for?'
@AdamSmudger i always did like them; though not as much as i like that song (covered or uncovered)! #boystheplay
@stewartDthomas &amp; re working with rupert here - i met him, interviewed, and got offered the job. been here for nearly 2 yrs now - v happily
@stewartDthomas good assistants are rare: balancing supporting the director &amp; challenging them, loving the production while taking it apart
@Lindseyalvis yes. obviously. #boystheplay
@SUSUtheatre if i did &amp; i told you &amp; the actors read it, that moment wd never be the same again. have loved working w cast tho #boystheplay
@drmikekershaw not very. analysing sheet music on the page is v different from trying to play it live &amp; make it sing #boystheplay
@RosieClark2 hardest thing about making work 4 tour is adjusting the actors' work weekly so it feels real &amp; not too quiet or too Theatrical
very exciting to hear mike bartlett's medea this morning at headlong hq #anewsidetofilicide
as a sunday treat, i give you my favourite shop name in all of west london 
#likecrazy - the overall effect much bigger than the sum of the parts; but so soulful and delicately devastating. felicity jones luminous
like the rickson hamlet (also landmark) it majors in things the first-stringers just don't value: tone, rhythm, luminosity etc. #stepchange?
will we look back on it as the moment when the aesthetic battle lines were really drawn?
what #3kingdoms highlights is just how far the theatre expectations of practitioners and first-string critics currently are from each other
#ThreeKingdoms - go, for god's sake, before it shuts on sat. masterly production, tonally perfect, and captures the neon thickness of dreams
within a week, i'm sure i'll have concluded that 40% of what happened at @_hightide_ was pure imagination. but for now -i know the truth
@lyngardner and brilliantly, mum ensured that he and his iphone (to prevent disturbance) were hidden under, of all things, a plastic... mac
few things are less sincere than the way actors greet other actors in public places
about to break in some boys #boystheplay
germaine greer: like king lear. started divisive, intelligent, clear-sighted. obvious gender issues. declines into inane chatter.
like the world's best elevators, this is exciting on so many levels: 
it's odd that the art form where it really is different depending on the day you go is the one most reliant on reviews written on one night
there's nothing holds you back like free rein
strong language? #starxlovers 
young people excited about shakespeare: worth all the travellodges and re-teching and city-schlepping #ourtaxmoneyhasnotbeenwasted
@fourbeatwalk @skymirror were there but world enough and (tech) time
halesworth. more like soho than we'd thought. 
@mrmrlonghurst @chloelamford has anyone seen his new production of 'measure for measure'?
the more i think about recentish theatre, the more i wish i'd seen the ostermeier hamlet twice. and not seen several other things at all.
@DaveyBook truesay. but even that was better than h. samuel the jewellers' 'once more unto the brooch' campaign from summer '89 #sideflip
theatre about big emotive issues is so often hollow - no matter how well done, you know what it's up to. take the quiet road. #kitsongenius
seen in united colors of benetton. chopp'd logic? #starxlovers 
In the R&J text: no balcony. In our show: no balcony. In today's e-mail: 7 separate refs to the 'balcony scene'. #stagehistoryholdsontight
@chrisianrolls cheers Chris - hope you're well
@TunjiLucas @catistewart saddest tweet i've ever read
why do english teachers all think they can direct plays? how many music teachers think they can conduct an orchestra? #postshowdiscussions
Today's #starxlovers challenge: find @TunjiLucas
