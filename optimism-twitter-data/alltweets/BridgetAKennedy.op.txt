HALL AND OATES! 
My excitement to see #HallandOates in concert tonight is too great for words!! #bucketlist
Who doesn't like to start their morning with soaking wet 5K's?! #53RBR
Woke up in a panic that I missed one of my finals... I graduate from college three years ago! #tgif
Lunch on the Grand Haven Boardwalk on this beautiful Michigan spring day! #lakeshorelove
Makes me want to take a backroad
I'm feeling hopeful, optimistic and thankful #staystrong #staypositive
Why?
Peed my pants tonight thanks to @brooksmcbeth and @joelmchale! Well done gentlemen! #ForgottenHarvest
@joelmchale I CANNOT WAIT to see you in Detroit tomorrow! I'm too excited to sleep! :)
Summer 2009 playlist playing, beautiful weather and spring clothes on! It's time to celebrate and enjoy the day with my friends!
When I say I can't complain, I honestly can't complain! #thegoodlife
Circle P. I missed you. #ltb @PureBarreGR
"Thank you Lord for bringing my dreams to pass. Thank you Lord that I'll become everything You created me to be." @JoelOsteen
SO EXCITED to be reunited with some of the Fox 17 crew tonight! I've missed my TV family!! :)
When you walk into work and everything is already done for you! #tgif #thelittlethings
Talks with gym members always ground me. Strong relationships &gt; strong physiques.
Optimistic.
Thank you mom for keeping me grounded :)
I feel like I can breathe again! #reevaluations
Thank goodness for my ride or die and my gym family for pulling me through this day! Blessed to have a strong support system!
Exhausted, no energy &amp; drained then Proud Mary comes on at the gym! I know you're w. me gramps! Thanks for support! Miss you #strength
Because turned out to be too nice how could I not sneak a round in! :) #golf #golfing #happyplace
@NicoleDFOX17 have you seen my face?! Clearly so excited to see you and be back! Reunited at the place it all started! :) #IFBchats
I love waking up so I can eat all the food. #5daysoffreedom
I wish @BWWings was open at this hour of the morning! Sometimes a girl wants some boneless wings before 7am :(
I'm too nervous for words. This team. @MSU_Basketball #GoGreen #MSU #Izzone #MarchMadness
That game gave me unnecessary anxiety #MarchMaddness
@WWMTLourin @darrenrovell @Ash0501 I'm all over it <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I love my niece more than she loves @GeneralMills @cheerios #cutiepie 
Sometimes you have the time of your life #lasvegas
I'm too excited to sleep any longer! Leaving for #LasVegas TODAY!!! :)
@jimmykimmel is my new favorite human and needs to sit on my couch 24/7 and make me laugh always! #afriendshipisborn
Nice work @tacobell this sriracha quesarito is the greatest thing I've ever eaten. My life is forever changed for the better #fourthmeal
Today is National @Oreo Cookie Day and that's really all that matters! #HappyFriday
15 days until my vacation to #LasVegas I CAN DO THIS! :)
All about Cool Brews, Hot Eats with @FOX17 @JackieOnAir at @AmoreTrattoria this morning @ExperienceGR @RichettMedia 
A new adventure is in my future.
A few days late but finally watching #SNL40 and yes I'm crying! A show I grew up watching at a very young age is still as classic as ever.
And I've already eaten 2 cupcakes and 2 brownies... Must be #ValentinesDay
I posted this squat challenge on my Facebook and Instagram page and I'm already up to 475 squats! Still 24 he left! 
Ball don't lie #GoPats #SuperBowl #TomBrady
#LikeAGirl
Officially blown away! MISSYYYYYY #SuperBowl
Calvin Johnson is said the @Lions aren't playing in the #SuperBowl 
I forgot what it was like to not be able to fall asleep because you're so hungry.
Sometimes I just wish my mind had an off switch!
I am so beyond obsessed with my friends!
Life is good, God is great and I have absolutely no complaints! :)
First day of the new job tomorrow and I'm too excited to sleep! It feels like Christmas morning all over again! 2015 is going to be great!
I forgot how much I missed writing!
A @QdobaMexGrill burrito would be real clutch right now #wishyouwere247
83 DAYS UNTIL #LASVEGAS! #MerryChristmas TO ME!!!! <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><AIRPLANE>️<CLINKING BEER MUGS><BASKETBALL AND HOOP>
Sometimes your parents tell you your Christmas present a day early... A TRIP TO VEGAS IN MARCH IT IS! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><FATHER CHRISTMAS><CLINKING BEER MUGS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
#TeamNoSleep <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SLEEPING FACE>
Sometimes I wake up and crave a bagel and cream cheese and talk in a Sarah Palin accent... #happyfriday
@WxKellySmith @sarahbrodhead I miss you girls so much!! Let's have a reunion soon! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><CHRISTMAS TREE><FATHER CHRISTMAS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
If @myorangeleaf was open right now that would just be perfection <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SOFT ICE CREAM>#froyo #froyoaddict
I truly do have the greatest friends!
Of course I'm laying in bed, eating pie straight out of the tin and watching the #VSFashionShow... what else would I be doing!?
Everyone here either says hi to you all the time, wants to lift with you or offers to spot you #southernhospitality
I hate when my preworkout kicks in before I get to the gym <FLUSHED FACE>
I still scream like a little child when lizards jump out in front of me as I'm walking <FLUSHED FACE>
And at 6AM it's STILL 70 degrees! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
70 degrees at midnight?! This state doe #Florida
FLORIDA <VICTORY HAND>️<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
VACATION MODE Y'ALL <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>️
Just starting to make my to-do list stressed me out. #getmeoutofhere
Nothing like hearing Ay Bay Bay during cardio to pump you up the night before vacation! #BayBayBridge
SO MUCH TO DO. NO TIME TO DO IT. <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@WWMTLourin I told you I was making cookies and that I had peppermint frosting!!
GIRLS NIGHT! <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><RIBBON><KISS MARK> #eatyourfeelings
There needs to be 4 of me to get everything I need to do today done. Anyone want to shop, workout, do my laundry, pack or work for me?! <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Once I learn to say no and put myself first my life will be a lot easier and a lot less stressful. Vacation: 2 days <VICTORY HAND>️#peaceoutGR
It's never too early for cheetah print leggings and blaring @taylorswift13
@Jif the real question is what don't I put it on! Everything from chicken to cookies to chips to just eating it straight out of the tub!
I'm not going to be mad if anyone wants to bring me waffles in bed.
@reneekernen at least I didn't have fish for breakfast!! But I maaaaaay have had some peppermint @Oreo for that preworkout energy #gains
And I almost just fell off the stepmill @reneekernen I can't be left alone unsupervised to do cardio <FLUSHED FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Physically present, mentally absent. <OK HAND SIGN>
William and Calvin were less than thrilled with trying to take a Christmas card photo last night! 
It's official: Smores @Jif whips is my favorite food! #peanutbutteraddict
In 4 days it will be nothing but sun, sand, pool drinks and golf courses! #Florida #vacation
Christmas cookies, Christmas movies and best friend time! <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><FATHER CHRISTMAS><CHRISTMAS TREE><COOKIE>#perfectsunday
Sometimes I catch myself singing out loud to @taylorswift13 while on the stepper! #sorrynotsorry #cardio #blankspace #weekendmemories
I really just want to be @khloekardashian is that too much to ask?
The smell alone of #Thanksgiving dinner makes me nauseous. #ionlylikepie
Back, bis and cardio smashed! 5 MORE HOURS UNTIL GO TIME! When you haven't been out in over a year this is a big deal! #rideordies
7 HOURS UNTIL I AM REUNITED WITH MY RIDE OR DIES! #NightBeforeThanksgiving #shenanigans
This will be the longest 24 hours of my life! REUNITED WITH MY BEST FRIENDS SO SOON <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS> #nojudgement #nightbeforethanksgiving
#TGIT <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Nothing says wake up and good morning like being outside in flip flops, shorts and a tank top. Apparently it forgot it was winter.
My partner in crime is in route from Texas to Michigan and I will be home in less than 48 hrs! SO EXCITED for this week/weekend! #rideordie
3 bodybuilders and me in the gym right now. Talk about intimidation <FLUSHED FACE>
I love training back at my gym in Ann Arbor! I've missed this place and these people!
@rebeccalutsic we all know I have a one track mind! Food over everything! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Who wants to deliver food, water and Gatorade to my bed?
"You're.... Worst..." @reneekernen
Tonight it's going down like 2009! #youngwildandfree
You know you hav the best manager when you walk out after your shift and your car is brushed off!!
@rebeccalutsic DEAL! I'm getting sick of nuts butters and just want some substance!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't want to leave my bed.
I also wouldn't mind a box of Fruity Pebbles delivered to my bed. @PostCereals
I wish someone would deliver a package of double stuffed @Oreo and a container of S'mores and Pumpkin Spice @Jif whips to my bed! #favorites
I just want carbs. #ketoproblems
When you verbally tell someone your goals, it helps keep you on track and have accountability! #pullup2015 #goals #fitness #weakupperbody
My goal to do 1 full body pull up by Jan. 1st 2015 is in full effect! You're welcome AM gym fam for the entertainment #thestruggleisreal
It's mornings like this that make me so grateful that in 15 days I'll be waking up in Florida!! #SunshineAndWhiskey
I can't feel my hands, legs or face but at least we have a shoveled driveway, walkway and sidewalk! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SNOWFLAKE>️ #gohomewinter
Calvin says good morning! Haven't even had him 24 hours and I'm too obsessed! #crazydoglady #rescuepup 
My new puppy named after my favorite @Lions of course! @Megatron81_ reppin' the jersey for game day! #Detroit #Lions 
Just when I thought @Hudsonville_IC couldn't get any better, this happened. #BreakfastOfChampions 
Officially too excited to sleep any longer!!! #dogday
It only takes one person to change your life for the better. So thankful for my person :)
To the gym member who I haven't seen in a year and told me I was looking in better shape... you have no idea how much you made my day :)
The return of living like it's summer of 2009 has OFFICIALLY begun! #lastweekendoffreedom #gohardorgohome
#TGIT FINALLY
Amazing. @Hudsonville_IC 
Not a day goes by where I don't wish @myorangeleaf was open 24 hours #ijustwantfroyoforbreakfast
Sometimes I buy a tub of s'mores #JifWhips and sometimes I eat the whole thing in one sitting! @Jif #nowineedsmore #addicted
It's funny how the place you hate the most can be the place you love the most, the place you find yourself, the place you change yourself.
It's one more day closer to Thursday <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Go away Monday. I want you to be Thursday already! #weekendoffwork
@WWMTLourin *coal
@WWMTLourin I'm actually busy now ;)
@WWMTLourin Yes you can have me on December 13th!! :)
On Sundays we go hard... in the kitchen #cantmove #cantbreathe #foodcoma
It's a Marge's Donut Den kind of morning! Starting #SundayFunday off right! #gonnutsfordonuts
Why did I think cardio was a good idea?!
#turndownforshot
I wish today was Sunday.
Cards of support &amp; words of encouragment from my AM gym fam! They knew this was a tough week for me &amp; went out of their way to make me smile
@bretteldredge you're my new boyfriend, I hope you're okay with that.
In exactly one month from today I will be in sunny, warm, beautiful Florida!! I have never needed a vacation so badly!! #getmeoutofhere
I wish someone would bring me candy in bed.
How is it only Tuesday?! Sunday CANNOT come fast enough. 
Every morning I wake up with the same thought: I really don't want to leave my bed. #LayZ
Sometimes I like to eat Pumpkin Pie @PopTarts411 in bed. #yolo
A beautiful fall night walk in my wonderful city! I adore you #GrandRapids! #GR #bluebridge 
Cardio party with all my favorite early morning gym family!! #gymlife #health #fitness #cardioraces
This extra hour got me like <FLUSHED FACE> #gymtime
I love chocolate.
The variety mix bag of @SNICKERS is the best thing that has ever happened to me #favoritecandy
@NicoleDFOX17 YES PLEASE! I think we need some spooky, sugary treats! #holdthetricks
When I say "will squat for candy" I mean it! Hamstrings smashed now nothing but my couch &amp; sugar for the rest of the day! #HappyHalloween
And sometimes you wake up with Halloween candy wrappers stuck to your thighs... #HappyHalloween #TreatsNoTricks
@reneekernen we should take them on a little field trip! Maybe I will have some portion control in front of strangers! ;)
Only @reneekernen understands my desires to smash $10 bowls of @myorangeleaf at 5:30AM! Another business I wish was 24/7! #froyoaddicts
It's so much easier to get up and be motivated in the morning when your roommate is up too! #earlymorningbonding
"Your outfits are so bright &amp; colorful in the gym, thanks for waking me up but you're still going down in cardio races!" #lovemygymfam
Bounce by @IGGYAZALEA #preworkout #danceparty
I wish it was possible to just hibernate for the rest of the year
I wish Grand Rapids didn't always smell like donuts.
I need to work on my sleeping in skills #earlybirdgetstheworm
So sad I'm not in Kalamazoo starting the day with kegs &amp; eggs, campus brews &amp; obnoxiously singing the fight song all day :( GO BRONCOS #WMU
Nothing days happy Thursday like spending 15 hours at the gym... #50hourworkweek #caffeineIVneeded
Flip flops were a bad choice.
I woke up like this... #starving
Why yes we do sing the @Lions fight song in our living room after touchdowns #wepromiseweregirls #SundayFunday
Wakes up. Wants @QdobaMexGrill and then realizes they don't open for 2 more hours #thestruggleisreal #lastburrito
I'm pretty sure the pumpkin pie @PopTarts411 are the best thing I've eaten in the past 10 months #toogoodforwords
Sometimes all you want and need is @mennasjoint #dubme
I love my life
No better combo than @LeanCuisine pizza, @meijer frosted cookie cake, pumpkin spice @Oreo &amp; a pint of @benandjerrys #goodmorning #goodnight
I wish @QdobaMexGrill was 24/7 because sometimes I just NEED diablo queso at 6:30AM.
Me walking later today or tomorrow probably won't happen. I love having the ability to push myself past my limits! #legday #punishit
Sometimes I find myself double fisting shaker cups at 5AM. #getwheysted #fitnessproblems
I wish @DairyQueen was open 24/7 so I could get blizzards for breakfast!
@jonathanwyndham I'll take you to the @CrackerBarrel in Grand Rapids, Michigan if you've never been! #cantbeatthecornbread
Oh yeah. It's definitely Monday.
And why isn't @DairyQueen open 24 hours #ineedablizzard
Grand Rapids needs an @insomniacookies ASAP! #nocookiesnofun
Sometimes I wake up and all I want is cookie dough and hot dogs...
@NicoleDFOX17 I LOVE that idea! My two favorite groups to lift!! Seems like my ideal split! ;)
The only reason I'm at the gym right now is so that afterwards I can eat apples, @QuestNutrition bars &amp; @Jif Pumpkin Spice Whips! #eattogrow
I wish that @blakeshelton would describe me as a badass. #WatchingBlinds
Actually excited and pumped up to be training legs right now! #turndownforsquat
I just want @blakeshelton to be my best friend. Is that too much to ask?! #IThinkNot #BlindsContinue
@AWojtys734 THANK YOU!! :)
For a c... 
Beyonce jam session and carbs post cardio! There's no better way to start a Saturday! #flawless
I forgot what it was like to sleep past 8AM! #TGIF
Too sore to function and too tired and hungry to think clearly. Today should be fun.
@NicoleDFOX17 OF COURSE! Plus oregano, basil, garlic powder and red pepper flakes! :) #BreakfastOfChampions
My eggs taste like pizza therefore today is the best day ever!
When you wake up at 4am because you had a dream/were excited about picking out the perfectly frosted cookie cake at @meijer #onlyinmydreams
Stepmill HIIT races w my early morning gym fam DONE! They always find creative ways to push me harder &amp; I didn't even trip! #cardiovictory
@blakeshelton is my preworkout. #obsessed
James David Carter needs to stay on The Voice for a LONG time! We need some eye candy during prime time! ;) #VoicePremiere #TeamBlake
5:30AM I'm doing cardio and my mom sends me a selfie of her eating a cupcake! I knew I got it from somewhere ;) #shegetitfromhermama
I can't wait to see my family today!! :)
My to-do list for the day is almost done and it's only 7:30AM! Talk about a super productive morning! <FISTED HAND SIGN> #ThatsHowIRoll  #WhoNeedsSleep
This has been me all week! TGIF! :) 
I need to stop having dreams about birthday cake.
I had a dream that @LukeBryanOnline was feeding me gourmet cupcakes in bed.. Needless to say I didn't want to wake up #sweetdreams
Happy last broadcast @sarahbrodhead it was an honor to be your producer! You're a true talent! Best of luck! XOXO 
Nothing motivates you more than the fact that you get carbs after morning fasted cardio #willsweatforcarbs
Cherry extract is a diet game changer. #heaven
Sometimes I online shop while I do my morning cardio and sometimes I trip on the stepmill #rollthecameras #happyfriday
Nurse @KaraJacobitz to the rescue! Front door: 1, Bridget: 0 #soclumbsyithurts #literally 
SO PROUD of my little kitten for behaving like such a gentleman as he just had his first interaction with dogs! #threeleggedlover
Human beings entertain me too much for words!
It's amazing how a simple "keep up the good work, I'm proud of you" from your gym fam can really brighten your day! #AMgymflow #fitfam
If only this was actually the case! At least it's Friday! #itstooearlyforcardio 
I don't know what's louder, this thunder or my stomach growling.
HAPPY BACK TO SCHOOL! From 4th grade, to 6th grade to 8th grade to now! BFF4EVER EST. 1998 @KaraJacobitz #dontkillme 
My mind says get to the gym but my body says stay in bed and sleep. #thestruggleisreal #helpmeimsore
Such a great night!!! :) #bestfriend #sister #wecanleavethenighton 
Three words: HIGH CARB DAY! I don't think I've been happier!
Night 2 of being so hungry I can't fall asleep <CONFOUNDED FACE> #hangry #dietingproblems #10weeksout from today!!
Happy #FlexFriday #FitnessFriday #health #fitness #muscles #gym #bicep #broday #sunsoutgunsout #diet #nutrition #arm 
Nothing like a post workout dance party to Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC! Still keeping the tradition alive every week! #BoybandFriday
Today is this kind of morning. 
@reneekernen ANY TIME! Just wait until mid November! Downtown GR and every dance floor in town won't know what hit it! ;) #roomiesgonewild
Literally so hungry I can't fall asleep. #hungerinducedinsomnia #hangry #dietingproblems #thestruggleisreal
Dreaming of carbs.
Nothing like face planting into the door on the way out of the gym.
I'm so happy it's my Friday! #zombiestatus #cantfunction
That post leg day high. #bestfeelingever
A 90's music pre leg day workout dance party is how every morning should start out! #turndownforquad
Oh oatmeal how I have missed you! #refeedday #carbs
When you're too excited about waking up to eat breakfast that it's tough to fall asleep... #dietingproblems
It just needs to be Friday.
#transformationtuesday a day late ;) thank you tricep/bootay for FINALLY starting to grow/change! #fitness #gains 
I swear Facebook knows all I want and all I've been craving is cream cheese! These @LoveMyPhilly adds are KILLING me. #creamcheeseaddict
Up and at em extra early this AM! I must be extra excited for my first day of my new leg workout! #legday #humpday 
The view from my window last night! I can't believe I'm moving into my house today! #GrandRapids #downtown #city 
Morning HIIT cardio on the stepmill is SO much better with a buddy! :)
#fitpals
Dropped and shattered my giant glass vase in order to save my @redbull from spilling #priorities #caffeineovereverything #ineedmywings
Packing my Keurig already was a mistake.
@Fabbigail hey girl!! No I don't!! I use any kind of fitness tracking devices! I just go by the way I look and feel! :)
Only a few more days left to enjoy this view from my bedroom window! #sunrise #downtown #GrandRapids 
The Milkshake Song NEVER gets old! #preworkdanceparty
The next few days will be filled with packing, packing &amp; more packing! I can't wait to FINALLY move into our home &amp; live with my best fran!
Nothing like some sprints to start off your morning #cardioallthetime #thenewnormal
Sometimes 12 hours with your best friend is all you need! #otherhalf #secretmissionsunday #movehere @KaraJacobitz 
The weird looks you get while eating a can of frosting in the Meijer parking lot. #cheatmeal #ihopeihaveenougleftforthecookies
True life: I'm motivated by cake
The lady in front of me at Starbucks paid for my coffee this morning! What a surprise! I can't wait to pay it forward to someone else today!
Cardio alone wasn't nearly as fun :( come back @KaraJacobitz!! We have steppers to step and trails to run together! I miss you! #fitpals
I need a lifetime supply of @tridentgum and Trident Layers. #addict #twopacksadayproblems
Foam rollering your chest is one of the most awkward things. #helpmeimsore
Obsession of the day: chocolate chip cookie dough protein pancakes!
You simply can't beat Reeds Lake at sunrise! This will always be my happy place! #EastGrandRapids #breathtaking 
Cake batter protein donuts with chocolate frosting?! YES PLEASE! It's what gets me out of bed in the morning! #ChefBridget
I CAN'T WAIT FOR @KaraJacobitz TO GET HERE!! Less than 8 hours! BEST midweek pick me up ever!! #fitpals #reunited
New week. Fresh start. Change of attitude. The past is in the past. I CAN DO THIS. #doubtfreeweek #goal
I'm convinced the radio knows what's going on in my head and playing everything I need to hear. #hiddenmeaning
Awake at 5:15am on my day off... Well I guess that's sleeping in for me ;)
Low carb days are not my friend. #hangry #carbcycling
SO PROUD to see this girl on my TV screen! Only 3yrs ago we were little interns! @KocoMcAboy #tbt #throwbackthursday 
I have managed to set my smoke alarm off and face plant into a door all before 5:40am... Thank goodness it's my Friday! #needtheweekend
@AlanLLee CONGRATS &amp; GOOD LUCK ON YOUR NEXT ADVENTURE! That newsroom won't be the same without you! Enjoy your well deserved celebration! :)
I can't catch a break. SO HAPPY tomorrow is my Friday! :)
Cheetah spandex on leg day was a bad idea. #turndownforsquat
You know it's going to be a good day when the first song you hear in your car is Kevin Federline... #mixedCDproblems
#transformationtuesday #health #fitness 
I wish I was still in bed. Or snuggled in this short stack. 
There is no better feeling than walking out of the gym feeling so accomplished, knowing you gave it your all! #beastmode #monsterweekpart2
When your protein pancakes tastes just like cake batter you know you did it right!
I think kicking my cotton candy craving with @USPlabs @Jack3dUSP at 10:30pm was a bad idea. The blue raspberry is just AMAZING though! #fan
An absolutely perfect weekend coming to end! It was such a blessing to FINALLY have the WHOLE family all together! :) #allsmiles
This picture captures it all! I'm SO excited for the happy couple!! <BRIDE WITH VEIL><RING><TWO HEARTS>#bestfransengaged

SO HAPPY that the secret is out!! My best fran and future roomie is ENGAGED!!! :)
This How We Roll Remix. @FLAGALine and @jasonderulo have outdone themselves with this one. #nowplaying #obsessed
Thank you Sweet Brown for saying exactly how I feel this morning! #lowcarbday  #watchout 
I hate that I eat and 5 minutes later I'm STARVING again :(
#tbt to before I knew what a gym was &amp; before I knew I had an arm... #throwbackthursday #health #fitness #gymlife 
Seriously, @Oreo needs to stop releasing all of these limited flavors until I'm done dieting! #oreoaddict #109days 
I forgot how much stuff you can actually get done when you have the ENTIRE day off! No work OR teaching for this girl! #productivehumpday
@ISOMFox2 aww thank you! I miss you pretty lady!! :)
@BScutchy thank you! :) I follow a clean eating diet paired with lifting heavy weights in the gym!
From fist pumps &amp; jugs of booze to bicep pumps &amp; protein shakes! #transformationtuesday #health #fitness 
Cruise by @FLAGALine will NEVER get old! #preworkoutjam
I love pancakes.
A huge bruised knee, bruised shins &amp; a bleeding quad gash. Lifting heavy with proper form #successfulbackday #monsterweek #helpmeimsore
I don't think I can get to the gym fast enough! SO READY to lift heavy and see what my body is capable of! #carbsforlife
Going to bed full of frosting, cupcakes and many types of cookies is the best feeling in the world! #sugarcoma #sugarhigh #cheatmeal #full
When you're so full of frosting it hurts to breathe, you did it right! #cheatmeal #cheatsohard #coachmademedoit 
I have the greatest brothers! :)
It wouldn't be a typical morning if I didn't get protein powder and peanut butter all over my pants #TGIF
Just finished making my BoostCamp class for tomorrow! Come and let me kick your booty (literally) to start off your weekend! #circuits
I just want to lay in my bed for the rest if the week #overit
Sometimes your best friend is the best medicine! :)
Feeling very overwhelmed by all the love &amp; support! Yes I do have an Instagram: bridgetakennedy @JillianMichaels #transformationtuesday
After seeing @JillianMichaels speak I was inspired to change my life! 10 months later...  #transformationtuesday 
Ann Arbor bound in less than 24 hours! I CANNOT WAIT for this week to be over!
What is your favorite cookie?
#Local4Today 
One year ago today this little man walked onto my newscast and into my heart! HAPPY 1st BIRTHDAY PRICE WILL! 
If I could have anything in the world right now it would be a toasted bagel loaded with cream cheese and bacon #dietingproblems
Nothing like waking up at 3:30AM with the BIGGEST craving for @WONKAnation Rainbow Nerds and a @DairyQueen blizzard!
#CARBS
Today I feel stronger than ever! That's a feeling I haven't felt in a LONG time! <FLEXED BICEPS><FISTED HAND SIGN> #welcomeback
I don't know if I'm more excited that today is quad day, today is my Friday or that I'm currently eating peanut butter! #trifectaofwinning
The looks you get from guys in the gym as you drag out wood by yourself and start block pulls #priceless #strongereveryday
"True motivation comes from within. No one can hand it to you, but no one can take it away, either."
I forgot how good oatmeal was #carbdayproblems
I need arms like @serenawilliams #sunsoutgunsout
It's official, 13 weeks down, 13 weeks to go! I'm halfway through prep!
Today is a new opportunity. Another chance. A new beginning. Feeling recharged, refocused &amp; more determined than ever. NOTHING will stop me.
Quad day is better in neon pink spandex, a neon yellowYOLO trucker hat and a suns out, guns out jersey! #broday2K14 #coworkerliftingsesh
Nothing like a fresh batch of peanut butter banana protein cookies to start your morning! :)
With the support of my early morning gym family I was able to get my bench over 100 today!! FINALLY starting to feel strong again!
"It doesn't get any easier, I just keep getting stronger."
You know you're crazy when you leave Ann Arbor before 4am to get to Grand Rapids because you miss training in your gym too much...
Ah yes, the excitement for my weekly carb day has once again woken me up before 5:30... #competitorsChristmasmorning #wherestheoats
There is no better start to your morning than a cup of coffee and watching my favorite people on my favorite local morning news! @FOX17
True life: homemade peanut butter cups got me out of bed this morning.
I'm pretty sure giving up my Luke Bryant ticket for tonight was by far the most difficult sacrifice I've had to make yet :( #justthinkgains
When you wake up to a picture of Fruit Loops ice cream cake, you know it's going to be a good day! :)
I love waking up feeling determined, motivated, strong and excited! This week is MY WEEK!
My mom is so confused that I'm heading to the gym before 4:30AM and I'm more confused as to why she's awake and not coming with me!
No better feeling than having the entire gym to yourself for the 2nd day in a row!  I joined the right gym in Ann Arbor!
@BridgetAKennedy: Waking up and being able to eat carbs. It's a beautiful, beautiful thing! :)
#15weeksout <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@WWMTLourin @Ash0501 this meat muffin misses her chicken nuggets!! :)
"A dream doesn't become a reality through magic. It takes sweat, determination and hard work."
I can't help but bust into old school 90's dance moves when "This Is How We Do It" comes on at the gym #broday #thatishowidoit
When you think you have one @team_abb Speed Stack left and you open the refrigerator &amp; it's gone..  #whodrankit #chestdaybestday
Absolutely perfect weekend! I can't wait to go home again in just 4 short days! :)
My parents can't handle my sugar high! #oreos #funfetti #cheattreat
@WWMTLourin meat muffin date soon?!
I can no longer sleep because my cheat meal dessert is only a few hours away! I CANNOT WAIT to eat Oreos &amp; funfetti cake dip post workout!
@WWMTLourin @Ash0501 You two meat muffins better not be having too much fun without me! #buffnuggetlove
In 24 hrs, I will be eating frosting &amp; cookie cake in this gym parking lot. Not like I'm counting down the hours or anything ;) #cheatmeal
Naturally my body wakes me up at 5:30 on a Saturday morning but I'm so excited to hit the gym and try out my new set of exercises!
Cardio and abs done thanks to @LukeBryanOnline 12 more days! :) @JennyLMoote @kaypanfil #countrygirls
I officially have too much energy for 4AM!
4 monster workouts complete this week, only one more to go!! I can do this! Time to show those bis and tris what I'm made of! #riseandgrind
You know you're going to have a good lifting day when you hear your squatting song on the radio on the way to the gym! #legday
I love waking up to inspirational quotes from my friends! They keep me motivated especially when getting out of bed seems like a struggle :)
There is nothing worse than the smell of  fresh cooked hotdogs at 7AM #HappyMonday
Winning big @FireKeepers with my mom! #ladyluck 
Yes I just had a dream about oatmeal. Less than 12 hours until refeed day! #alliwantisacarb
All I can think about are blueberries.
All I want is a peanut butter and jelly on white bread #allAmerican
It doesn't get much better than eating carbs in bed #refeedforwhat
I wish I could sleep in past 5 am :(
@NicoleDFOX17 oh my those sound absolutely amazing! You're the cake pop queen so I know you will find it! Just make enough to share ;)
Got to love waking up at 4AM and all you're craving is birthday cake.
Mistake of the morning: wearing hot pink spandex to the gym when you know you're doing straight leg dead lifts...
I had no motivation to do cardio and then my @Nike custom Air Jordan's came in the mail! #jsonmyfeet #gameon #pushhard
I'm glad that even on my day off my body will still wake me up at 4:45AM. I guess this means it's peanut butter time! ;) #couldbeworse
I forgot what it felt like to get 9 hours of sleep in a night! I feel like I could conquer the world! #rested
Either the carpet cleaner they used to cleaned my hallway in my building really does smell like cookie dough or I'm going insane. #dietprobs
Nothing makes my day more than a fresh piece of Tropical Twist @tridentgum #thebest
@sarahbakian seeing NKOTB was one of my favorite nights of last summer! I can't wait to plan another weekend getaway for this year! :)
My building smells like pancakes and syrup and downtown Grand Rapids smells like bacon and doughnuts. I'm going crazy #dietingproblems
Heading back to Grand Rapids after a perfect weekend :( only 6 more days until I'm back home again!
Celebrating Mother's Day at Comerica Park with the family! Let's go @tigers 
My body naturally woke me up at 5AM... at least that's "sleeping in" for me!
I wish I had a dollar for every time my mom told me to go eat a cheeseburger. #hangry #dietingproblems
Managed to make my meal and sneak out of the house to go to the gym without waking up my parents or making a dog bark! #istillgotit
Ann Arbor bound for the ENTIRE weekend in less than 12 hours!! I hope this day flies by!! I can't wait to be home!!! :)
You know it's time to go to bed when all you're doing is laying in bed and looking on Instagram of #oreosandpeanutbutter
Even though this thunder is pretty loud, it was my growling stomach that woke me up...
I forgot to bring my makeup to work today... I'm going to be scaring gym members left and right today #nomakeupTuesday #sorryboutit
Taking today hour by hour #<FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
When I come home every other word out of my moms mouth is eat a burger... #hangry #dieting #competitorlife
@Ash0501 JUMBO POPCORN! #weakness
Who needs sleep when you're about to graduate from college?! I love being back in Toledo! :) #KelleysGraduationWeekend
BACK IN THE TOL :)
I should be on my way to Toledo right now :( but I guess getting there at midnight is better than not getting there at all...
Thanks water bottle for for exploding, soaking an ruining everything my entire gym bag. This week can be over. NOW.
Stressed to the max is an understatement BUT in 24 hours I will be on my way to @KelleyMoote for a weekend of celebration! #pushthrough
EXACTLY how I feel today. All I want is a carb. Like the good ole days. #tbt #throwbackthursday 
Fancy by Izzy Azalea #nowplaying #preworkoutflow #myjam
Peanut butter: it's what gets me out of bed every morning. #iwishiwaskidding
How is today not over yet? #wishingforWednesday
My spike shooter exploded in my gym bag and I legit slipped on a banana peel outside all before 7AM... oh this Tuesday should be real fun.
Nothing says good morning quite like incline sprints with the tightest hamstrings on this planet #nopainsnogains
I'm pretty sure eating a white chocolate Reese's egg on the floor of the gym locker room was one of the greatest moments of my life.
@WWMTLourin @Ash0501 there  just aren't enough words for my love of oversized tubs of movie theater popcorn I needed an email address ;)
Up before 5AM on a Sunday?! It must be because I'm just too excited that today is CHEAT MEAL DAY!!! #earnedit #dietersChristmasmorning
I CAN'T WAIT TO BE REUNITED!!! :) “@WWMTLourin: Buff Nuggs and Meat Muffins! @Ash0501 @BridgetAKennedy”
This Is How We Roll by @FLAGALine is my current favorite preworkout song! #nowplaying  #deltsmash
Laying in bed catching up on Real Housewives of Orange County all morning! I LOVE having Fridays off! :)
Nothing gets me more pumped up and ready for the day at 5AM than @Beyonce!
It's a listening to @LukeBryanOnline all day kind of day! #ilovedaysoff
Just looking for energy and motivation this morning...
@NicoleDFOX17 I'm glad you like it! Happy Birthday pretty! Have a great rest of your day!! :)
The amount of times I hear commercials for Taco Bell breakfast while working out just makes plain me sad #ijustwantfirstmeal
I LOVE seeing my two favorite people behind the anchor desk this morning! :) @sarahbrodhead @NicoleDFOX17 #ladypower
I really need to start wearing my glasses more.
Such a fun night at @FireKeepers with my parents! Coming home $1,200 richer doesn't hurt either! ;) #winning 
That moment when you squat over your body weight for the first time #legday #settingpersonalrecords
You know it's going to be one of those days when not even the sounds of peanut butter can get you out of bed and moving.
#chestdaybestday
I've never been more excited to eat eggs in my life
I just want a cinnamon roll.
What gets me out of bed at 4:30 AM on a Sunday?! #carbs #refeedday 
@WWMTLourin let's play soon for realz! I'll bring the meat muffins! ;)
@WWMTLourin Someone failed to invite me :( #lonelybigspoon
Sometimes on Saturday nights I like to lay in my bed and Instagram search #oreo pictures #noshame @Oreo
The worst part of almost cutting the tip of my thumb off? Texting and operating my phone is such a challenge #firstworldproblems
Homemade peanut butter cups is the BEST way to start a Saturday morning!
Rap music blaring and preworkout poured... I will find the motivation to leave my bed and go to the gym #stepmillfriday  #eyeontheprize
Nothing like the excitement of using a brand new preworkout to get you out of bed at 4am! #riseandgrind #Jack3dMicro @USPlabs #bisandtris
Let Me a Take A Selfie is the BEST song to do sprints to! Yes I was caught fist pumping on the treadmill #noshame #live
We may be in different cities but we're at the gym at the same time motivating each other the whole way through! @Amyers916 #killinit
Here's my #loyalviewerselfie for you @sarahbrodhead! I'm even reppin' your alma mater too! ;) 
That awkward moment when the elevator stops and the guy who gets in is at least a 70 year old man wearing a speedo... #happytuesday
@sarahbrodhead A normal person who still can't help but start my day at 3:45 most mornings! Miss you :) #loyalviewer
True life: I get out of bed every morning for peanut butter.
What a beautiful day to hit the golf course for some hill sprints! I love being home and I love this weather! #hiit #sprints #hills #sun
Waking up and smashing carbs. Life really doesn't get much better than this! Happy Sunday :) #refeed
Going to bed the night before refeed day is the same feeling I have going to bed on Christmas Eve #foodie #excited #fillmeup
FINALLY found a gym in Ann Arbor with heavy dumbbells, a squat rack AND amazing deals for a quality club! Thanks @AnytimeFitness #lifesaver
@DaniCarlsonTV8 @NicoleDFOX17 Only 6 short months separate me from this waffle cone! I will be waiting in line for when they open! ;)
Walking out of the casino $600 richer is  a nice little way to start the weekend! :)
Home sweet home! So excited to spend the weekend in Ann Arbor with my parents :) #eastsidelove
Thanks to the random man at the gym for spotting me during skull crushers! That term could have been taken literally if it wasn't for you!
@NicoleDFOX17 I just had the best jam out session in the parking lot! #prebitriflow #thanksjustin
Mirrors by Justin Timberlake will NEVER get old! SUCH a jam!
I love seeing all of the @alphaxidelta sisters on the @TODAYshow! #WorldAustismAwarenessDay #LIUB #XiLove #ListeningTogether @autismspeaks
Nothing feels better than dropping a 45 pound plate on your toe first thing in the morning #gymklutz #legdayproblems
Wear blue today for #WorldAustismAwarenessDay! I'm also proudly sporting my @alphaxidelta letters! @autismspeaks #listeningtogether  #LIUB
@mkobriger @WWMTLourin I drive from Grand Rapids when the frutty pebble marshmallow crunch sugar cookie cupcake is on the menu! #addict
The senior citizens in my first aerobics class played an April fools prank on me, messing with my music! They keep ME young! #lovemyjob
#Local4Today 
#chestdaybestday
I'm in love with my life :)
#callmemaybe
True friendship is when you drop something and your friend picks it up for you because this morning was leg day! @stephg12345
I truly have the best coworkers ever, I'm in love my job and I don't have to work Fridays! I really have no complaints going to bed tonight!
MMM Yeah by Austin Mahone featuring Pitbill #nowplaying #preworkoutflow
When I wake up tomorrow @TacoBell will be serving breakfast and my whole world will finally be complete! #firstmeal
There is nothing more rewarding than leading aerobic exercise classes to senior citizens! I'm in love with my job! #SilverSneakers
I love waking up with @sarahbrodhead and @AveryFOX17 you two still always put a smile on my face and make me laugh to start my morning!
HAPPY OBERON DAY! I wish I were at @BellsBrewery like I was every year in college celebrating! #favoritebeer  #springishere
@AnnMarieLaFlamm I LOVE that dress you're wearing! You look gorgeous!! Miss you girl! :)
@KaraJacobitz @MorganLusk @sethbroekhuizen @kelli04pap you sure know how to pick your friends! :) #partyanimals #hangovercures
I have chili cheese in my nail beds.. #TFTF #hotmessexpress @bekahwehman

These basketball teams just don't care about my bracket this year #MarchMadness
HELLO WEEKEND
@VeeGuzman EXACTLY what I needed! Thanks for sweepy snapping me right to the cardio machines! I feel so much better! :) #WeGotThis
Good friends force you out of bed to do AM cardio... @VeeGuzman
Sometimes I just like to eat spoonfuls of peanut butter in my bed #fatkidproblems
You know you love your job when it's your day off and you find yourself there for over 3 hours just hanging out! :) #therightmove
The senior citizens in my Silver Sneakers classes out a smile on my face! I'm so lucky to be teaching classes and doing what I love!
#IOI2014
My alarm is going off in 4 hours! I CANNOT WAIT FOR IRISH ON IONIA!!!
Having every Friday off is the greatest thing in the entire world! #ilovemyjob
HAPPY 313 DAY!! I love you #Detroit just for who you are and who you will become! You're the greatest city in the world! #MotorCity
After my monster of a leg day yesterday, of course my Silver Sneakers class is leg intensive filled with squats &amp; lunges  #cantwalk
@WWMTLourin Why are we not eating @benandjerrys together right now!? #biglittlespoon
If any one hand delivered me any  @benandjerrys pint straight to my bed I wouldn't be mad about it! #iscreamforicecream
Stumbled into a wall and fell right into door on the way out of the gym! My legs feel like straight jello! Signs of a successful leg day!
Up and at the gym way earlier than usual! I think I'm TOO excited for leg day! #doesntinvolvedelts
After a good, hard lifting session at the gym I always crave @ReesesPBCups #neverfails
Just finished putting together my first solo Silver Sneakers class for tomorrow! Get read to boogie because it's 70's themed! #nightfever
LET THE ROAD TRIP TO OXFORD BEGIN! @KelleyMoote #MiamiOrBust #BeatTheBlock #BirthdayWeekend2014
Ally's Boutique fashion show with @bekahwehman at Louis Benton to benefit Autism Support of Kent County! Such a great night on the town!
@NicoleDFOX17 Can we push National Oreo Cookie Day back a few months and celebrate together in September?!
So many exciting things to look forward to and celebrate the rest of the week! It feels SO GOOD to have absolutely zero complaints! :)
@NicoleDFOX17 HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!! I'm so lucky I've gotten the chance to work with you this past year! You're such a rockstar! :)
Sleeping in, fasted cardio and a hot breakfast date with my foam roller! Not a bad start to this hump day!
Extremely friendly and helpful customer service, especially at 6:30AM can really make my day! Thank you @Walgreens :)
It's one of my favorite days of the year! #MardiGras #FatTuesday 
Oscar party with my main ladies
Saturdays are for being lazy and watching movies all day! What a perfect day/night! :)
@KelleyMoote ONE WEEK FROM TODAY AND WE ARE OXFORD BOUND!! We have SO much to celebrate I can't wait! :) #HYFR #Miami #TrashCanMe
@sarahbrodhead Aww happy anniversary! It's such an honor to work with you! I'm lucky to have such a beautiful, talented coworker! :)
Just working on my biceps this fine Friday morning #FlexFriday #gymselfie  #turndownforwhat 
When the first song you hear at the gym is Trophies by Drake you know you're going to have a good workout! #eyeontheprize #deltsmash
The Harlem Shake is blaring at the gym right now! ONE DAY CLOSER TO MIAMI! #BrickStreet #TrashCans #OxfordOrBust 9 DAYS @KelleyMoote
For once I'm actually happy that it's leg day! I don't think my rear delts/ upper body could take another beating today! #training
I'm so fortunate that I live less than 10 minutes from my best friends! :)
True Life: I can't even spend less than 10 hours away from the gym! I love this place, its members and what it stands for! #teamendurance
It's Miley! A 5-week-old Syrian Brown Bear who stopped by the studio!  Just a typical day in the newsroom! :) 
It wouldn't be a morning if I didn't spill preworkout all over my pants... My pink pants. #dayinthelife #prosupps
Hi!
Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who gets caught dancing at the gym! It's definitely a party with tris and chest this morning! #pumpedup
The step mill is actually a lot more fun when you're torturing yourself with another person! I love my AM morning workout buddies! :)
@I_Am_An_Ashley it doesn't get much better than the Writings on the Wall album!
I can appreciate the amount of Destiny's Child being played at the gym this morning! #independentwomen
Nothing like a little Backstreet Boys to kick off my morning! #boybandfriday
@JeffreyTulloch @jtulloch2 alright divo you don't need two twitter accounts ;) #deleteone #fattyfoodhaze #sugarcoatedbrain
Well I can already tell today is going to be a LONG day! #alreadydying @bekahwehman @jtulloch2 #toocrazy2K14
The longest minute of my day is the last minute on the step mill.
Nothing says good morning and wake up than accidentally spilling your entire gallon jug of water all over yourself :(
Seeing this #OneTankTrip made my morning! Leave it to @sarahbrodhead @AveryFOX17 and @mikedavislive to make me smile this Monday! @FOX17
@MRaeW A little bit of wine and sex and the city slots :) GOOD LUCK!!
Celine Dion pandora plus the sauna, I couldn't ask for a more relaxing Friday afternoon!
It wouldn't be a conversation between best friends if peanut butter and San Diego didn't come up at least once! @KaraJacobitz
A little Kip Moore pandora to get me through AM cardio! I can't wait to see him with one of my favorites, @ladyantebellum this Sunday!
I absolutely love my lady AM lifters! We smashed leg day together, pushed &amp; motivated each other the whole way through! I love this place :)
Leg day. It's what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I can't believe it's been 3 months EXACTLY since I started my journey. #TransformationTuesday #training #fitness 
@KaraJacobitz ANYTIME!! I love our overnight 3rd shift dates! ;)
A 55 minute @TurboFire class, a solid ab workout and a "mint chocolate chip/rocky road" protein shake to start my morning! Happy Sunday! :)
Best friends can make your morning even when they are all the way in Texas! :) I miss you more than words @JennyLMoote
I hate leaving the gym as all of my lifting ladies and gents are walking in! I miss working out with them! I can't wait until Monday! :)
Please don't tell me I didn't just have an allergic reaction to oatmeal... This is going to be one fun leg day.
@KocoMcAboy Aww thanks so much girl!! :)
Absolutely killed it this morning! I still can't believe how much I've changed in 3 months #TransformationTuesday 
I woke up to the greatest, most motivating text today! I have the greatest friends &amp; support system! They keep me going when I don't want to
Don't worry @KaraJacobitz I just preordered 2 boxes of @QuestNutrition cookies &amp; cream bars! I hope this feeds my Oreo addiction! #onaquest
"You try to break me down I'm going to go harder." #motivationmonday
I'm so thankful shoulder made the recovery just in time for shoulder day! At the gym early and excited for this lift session! #smashcity
I just don't know what to watch tonight, The Grammys or Bachelor Sean and Catherine's wedding! #SundayNightDillema
@KaraJacobitz I can't wait!! We're such addicts! I have such high expectations!! #onaquest #oreoaddict
@DanaChicklas Anytime girl! Welcome to weekend mornings! Stay warm out there! ;)
Every single person, including the guys are wearing purple at the gym... and then there's me. in neon yellow. #sorethumb #putyourblinderson
I definitely have more energy this early in the morning than the average person! #riseandgrind #carpediem
#ThatAwkwardMoment when The Macarena comes on your 90's pandora station and you catch yourself dancing on the treadmill #doublecardio?
I'm already excited for tomorrow mornings workout! After today I can't wait to see how I can push and challenge my body in a new way!
"If it doesn't scare you it doesn't challenge you. If it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you."
@HaleyOtman Aww thank you so much!! I miss you! Let's get together soon! I'm always down for some water on the rocks ;)
The moment you've realized you've gained your life back! 2 miles in 17:03! #TransformationTuesday #personalbest 
"It was past 6AM, I got worried you weren't going to show up this morning!" I love this #gymfam Always looking out for one another goals! :)
There is some SERIOUS energy in this weight room this morning! Cheering, high fives &amp; pushing each other to the limits! #motivationmonday
Waking up at 4am instead of 11:30pm is such a treat! I love my weekends! #riseandgrind
I can't believe today is my "Friday" and I've already had such a fun "weekend" so far! I really do have the BEST coworkers ever! :)
@Amyers916 Thanks lady! I miss you! :)
I'm very sorry biceps but I had no choice but to beat you up this morning! #flexfriday #makingprogress #training 
I can't describe how happy being in the gym makes me! This journey is absolutely amazing! The people I meet, the changes, the motivation! :)
@KocoMcAboy Aw thanks girl!! Let's get together soon! I miss you! :)
"discipline is doing what you know needs to be done, even though you don't want to." #eyeontheprize #training
"If you start something and you finish it you win every time."
@NicoleDFOX17 @sarahbrodhead Aww I just have no words for him! Prince William is such the little trend setter! ;)
There is no better sight first thing in the morning than an empty weight room! Bring it on leg day! #quadsquad
@Amyers916 Aww thank you! That means alot! :)
Such an AMAZING and much needed power cardio workout! Now time for protein pancakes and Juan Pablo! #SundayFunday
It's crazy to think the amount of weight I'm adding is the amount of weight I've lost so far #TransformationTuesday 
@KaraJacobitz #CaliforniaDreamin <SAILBOAT>️<TWO HEARTS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
It's amazing how things work out! Everything really does happen for a reason! Feeling reenergized, refocused and extremely motivated! :)
My mile time this morning was 8:19! I don't know who this girl is or where she came from but she can stay awhile! Maybe change is good! :)
The happiest I am all day is when I'm at the gym #truelife
Make goals, set goals, meet goals. @KaraJacobitz WE GOT THIS! #fitpals #lifepals  #accountability
@AlanLLee I'll take any excuse to come over and spent the day with the Lee family! :)
Lifting heavy cures all.
@VeeGuzman ANYTIME!!! I'm here for you girl!! :)
I would NOT have made it through legs without you! These last few days have been brutal! Thanks for your constant support @KaraJacobitz
"Can I borrow that workout outfit? Your bright neon clothes always wake me up and make me smile in the morning!" I love my AM gym fam! :)
Nothing like some mid-leg day snaps &amp; tweets from @KaraJacobitz to get me motivated to finish strong! This is what #fitpals are all about!
I wish my body didn't naturally wake me up at 3:15 every morning #riseandgrind #nodaysoff
@WxKellySmith anything for you my weather princess! West Michigan appreciates all of your hard work, and so do I :)
Welcome back from vacation  @sarahbrodhead! It's nice to see your beautiful face back at the desk! :) I've missed you!
My commute to the gym this morning didn't take as long as I thought it would! Looks like my shoulders get some extra attention today!
If something is that important to you, you will do whatever it takes to make it happen, no matter the circumstances #gymflow #training
Leaving the gym as the sun comes up! That's when you know your Saturday is off to a GREAT start! #training
This shouldn't be allowed. 
Wearing all blue for my bicep and back workout this morning #motivation
Goosebumps. @MSU_Football are #RoseBowlChampions! What an incredible day to be a Spartan fan! #SpartanNation #CheersDantonio #unreal
VICTORY FOR MSU!! I KNEW MY BOYS  WOULD DO IT! #RoseBowlChampions #CheersDantonio
In bed by 10, not even knowing the new year happened, waking up almost 12 hours later and being surrounded by my best friends! #bestNYEever
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my co-worker and best friend @WxKellySmith I hope you have a GREAT day! XOXO! 
"Have a Happy New Year! You're the one to watch out for in 2014!" My early morning gym fam really knows how to put a smile on my face! :)
Welcome to the team @DanaChicklas! It's nice to finally meet you! :) We're happy to have you here!
"Train like you're in second place."
Reunited with my best friends for Sarah's wedding! It's an FGRHS class of 2007 reunion! 
The only thing getting me through the day is knowing a reunion is my near future! @KelleyMoote @JennyLMoote @stephg12345 #since1998
Feels so good to be absolutely killin' it back in my 2nd home! I was getting withdrawls! #riseandgrind biceps #chest #training
I forgot how amazing it was to sleep for 12 hours!
Even though it's #Christmas I can't afford to take a day off! No surprise I'm the only one at the gym! #riseandgrind #training
A 24 hour gym that's closed on Christmas Day just doesn't make any sense to me.
You know it's going to be a good lifting session when you walk into the #gym and SClub7 is playing! #throwback #gymflow #quadsquad
New 90's playlist making it's debut at the gym today! Boy bands and Jock Jams fueling me through shoulders and traps #gymflow
#IAmBritneyJean
No amount of ice, slush or snow on the roads will stop me from getting to the gym and working towards my goals! #gymflow #training
That moment when your fitness idol comments on your Instagram photo that just so happens to be health related! #icandiehappy @MonicaGray
I would never sacrifice my 2 hours of heaven in the gym for anything #FlexFriday #health #fitness #training 
It's going to be a good day when you get to the gym, realize your pants are on inside out &amp; backwards &amp; your socks don't match #TGIF
Riding it out on less than one hour of sleep but @kanyewest was totally worth it #riseandgrind #todayshouldbefun
#YeezusTour with the baddest girls out there! We're ready for you @kanyewest
@KaraJacobitz not many of us can be TRUE to the #riseandgrind ALL YEAR ROUND ;)
@KaraJacobitz ALL OF THESE THINGS ANNOY ME.
Dropping a 45 pound plate on your foot is the greatest feeling in the world #weightliftingproblems
I don't know what I like more, knowing it's tricep/back day or that I'm going to the @kanyewest #YeezusTour tonight! #WinningOnThursday
@KaraJacobitz the way my shoulders &amp; traps feel today I couldn't be more happy it's leg day! #quadsquad #shouldbesleeping #riseandgrind
#quadsquad #riseandgrind
I would have gotten out of the car but then this happened! 2 MORE DAYS! #YeezusTour @kanyewest 
2 and a half hours and I didn't even get to finish all my shoulder sets :/ round 2 I'm coming for you this afternoon! #training #inthezone
Nothing like a Hannah Montana song making an appearance on your Lil Wayne pandora station #notmadaboutit
I feel more than rested after sleeping for 11 hours last night! Ready to absolutely crush shoulder day! #riseandgrind #weightlifting
@AveryFOX17 @sarahbrodhead Good Morning! Of course that's cool! I will have those in for you this morning! :)
Last leg day of the week! #riseandgrind #gymflow
I thought I needed a Red Bull to start my morning, and then Enrique Iglesias started playing! #givesyouwings
Workouts done when you're mentally and physically weak prove just how mentally and physically strong you really are. #mindset #dedication
Alright preworkout and Ke$ha songs, I'm going to need you to work your magic extra hard this morning! #riseandgrind #timber
Never did I ever think I'd be 'that girl' leaving for the gym at 3:15AM... and here we are. #riseandgrind #quadday #dedication
I would love nothing more than to keep laying in bed but those weights aren't going to lift themselves! #riseandgrind
I know I've had a successful day when I'm in bed by 5:30! Can't wait to hit the gym hard tomorrow morning. Bring it 4AM #riseandgrind
It's shoulder day up in here this AM! #MotivationMonday #flabtofit #health #fitness #weightlifting #riseandgrind 
Oh winter, you and your snow covered roads make me have to wake up even earlier to get to the gym on time. Is it spring yet? #riseandgrind
Just crushed another AMAZING lifting session all before 7:30! I absolutely love being in the gym! #health #fitness #gymrat #secondhome
Preworkout poured, protein muffin made and a 15 minute ride to the gym! Time to get Sunday started on the the right foot! #riseandgrind
As much as I would love to stay up and watch the Spartans beat OSU, falling asleep to The Santa Clause sounds SO much better! #favemovie
#ExtremeCheapskates may just be my new favorite guilty pleasure! #TLC
Is it too early for a #CHEERSDANTONIO I think not! LETS GO GREEN! @KelleyMoote @JennyLMoote #MSU #SpartanPunch
At the gym before sunrise, leaving after the sun comes up. #hardwork #dedication #motivation #goals
Alright preworkout, you can kick in ANYTIME now! #riseandgrind
It's amazing what a 2 hour lift session to start my day does for my mood! :) #HappyFriday
@KaraJacobitz spilled BLUE preworkout all over my RED pants! I guess that's what happens when boybands pump you up! #purplepants #merica
@KaraJacobitz it's Friday AND it's bicep day?! How did I get so lucky?! I think this calls for neon pants! #riseandgrind #lookgooddoinit
The ONLY thing I forgot to bring to the gym is pickle juice... the one thing I need right now more than anything? Pickle juice. #gymfail
I wish this morning was anything but back and shoulders! I'm so sore it was a struggle to get out of bed! #riseandgrind
What does @AveryFOX17 @sarahbrodhead and @mikedavislive have up their sleeve this holiday season?! @FOX17 #fox17 
@KaraJacobitz after yesterday I can't lift my arms over my head! My face &amp; hair look so pretty today ;) why did we decided to join new gyms?
@KaraJacobitz nothing like looking at your workout schedule and realizing it's leg day... #onlegdayswewearpink #fitpals #riseandgrind
I just realized I left my hair dryer, hair straightener and make up in my gym locker... I should look extra pretty tomorrow #gymratprobs
Waking up knowing that you're going to a new gym is better than waking up to a tree full of gifts on Christmas morning! #riseandgrind
Boy band pandora and weight lifting, what more you ask for to start your Monday morning?!
Friends that workout together, stay together! My #fitpal is here and we're about to KILL IT in the gym together #riseandgrind @KaraJacobitz
One thing I love more than #BlackFriday is #SmallBusinessSaturday! I can't wait to check out all my fave local stores downtown #GrandRapids
I love Lifetime movies and Hallmark Channel movies a little bit too much!
@NicoleDFOX17 I LOVE your skirt this morning! Looking gorgeous as always! Royal blue is your color! :)

@KaraJacobitz 4 miles have been logged as well as lunges, squats and quad work all because of you! #fitpals #beastmode #riseandgrind
Sometimes I forget I'm not the only one at the gym and fist pumping while running leads to many strange looks by other runners #gymfail
@KaraJacobitz If it wasn't for you I'd still be in bed! Bring it on 3-a-day Tuesday #morningmotivation #futuremarathoners #fitspiration
@KaraJacobitz getting out of bed this morning was one of the most painful things I've done! #nopainnogain #sweatoversleep #fitpals
@KaraJacobitz I think we may be the most graceful TRXers ever!
@KaraJacobitz Me too, especially when I try new things and up falling off the straps! I should wear a helmet! #trxproblems #riseandgrind
@KaraJacobitz I'm sticking with my upper body theme so chest, biceps and strength! 4:30 is going to come all too soon! #sweatoversleep
@KaraJacobitz they've held up for 8 miles today &amp; just need to make it through a TRX sesh later! They'll be real mad at 5AM tomorrow though!
Registration is now open for the 2014 Fifth Third River Bank Run! Now to do the 25K or just keep it modest with the 10K #runnersdecisions
@KaraJacobitz GOOD LUCK! I did a 5K this morning then TRX and another 5 miles are all on the agenda! WE GOT THIS! #nopainnogain #fitpals
@sarahbrodhead aww thanks lady! I'm glad to see you back &amp; rested from vacay! I missed you! You can ignore my slight limp this morning! :)
Just PR'ed my 5K time! It must be that 'morning after half marathon' high that really fueled me this morning! @KaraJacobitz #fitpals
Training may be over but 5AM gym sessions are not! Who needs recovery time when you have motivation? @KaraJacobitz #riseandgrind #fitpals

@MRaeW yes! I've ran 4 half marathons since 2011&amp; training for my 5th in Oct! Once I take a step out the door it's all mental from there!
It's so hard to decide what piece of @alphaxidelta clothing I want to wear tomorrow in honor of #FoundersDay!
That was the best 7 miles I've ever ran! Downtown #GrandRapids sure is beautiful in the spring! :)

Having a little fun this morning in light of the Super Bowl blackout!

@sarahbrodhead I saw that and smiled! It's so amaxing our sisters are everywhere doing great things! Including one desk over ;)
I can sum up this Super Bowl in three words: Beyonce. Kelly. Michelle
