@HargreavesBC my thoughts on tchr workload 
@JonBissell I guess I have higher standards than you when it comes to such information.
@JonBissell meaningless, uninformative and inaccurate. Without transparency, there's no accountability.
@JonBissell nor does it mean they are meaningful or informative in any way.
@JonBissell the average is 7-8 kids less than my reality. I teach 29 more students a day. This information is not transparent or accountable
@JonBissell what good is class size average reports if they are this inaccurate? 
@JonBissell I'm not an anomaly. This under reported data is misleading.
@DonMartinYEG thx Don!
Class sizes in Alberta are skyrocketing &amp; under-reported 
@KerryTowleMLA thank you for that. I wish @gordondirks had attended @albertateachers forum instead of door knocking for Danielle Smith
@KerryTowleMLA we don't have 2 agree - We need 2 keep in touch. I live in your riding but work in RD. Please consider 
@KerryTowleMLA and I didn't know about one of them. How do I get in the loop for these things?
@KerryTowleMLA maybe you &amp; PCs would understand had you showed up for @albertateachers forum 
@KerryTowleMLA I'm one of your constituents. "Holding the line" is a cut &amp; ignores growth &amp; inflation @MarieFrRenaud 
I teach 29 more kids everyday than @AlbertaEd reports. That's about 7 more students in every class #ableg #abed

@TheQuestioner11 the math wars make for a fun argument among adults but do little to help children 
@TheQuestioner11 want to raise math scores? Do something about the 1 in 7 children living in poverty. 
@TheQuestioner11 good question. First we must understand what test scores tell us and what they don't tell us 
@TheQuestioner11 the only way to assess a teacher or learner is to observe them teach and learn...
@TheQuestioner11 I have extremely high standards for my students. High standards &amp; standardization are not the same thing.
@TheQuestioner11 it's easy to hide behind anonymity. I stand by my experience &amp; research and share it proudly.
@DavidSabados79 savings &amp; investments are exempt from sales tax = tax break for wealthy @pkerner777
@TheQuestioner11 I would need to observe the teacher to see the feedback they give students while they are learning.
@TheQuestioner11 you can't construct meaning in a preconceived bubble 
@TheQuestioner11 here's what learning looks like 
@TheQuestioner11 no because doing projects requires more learning and teaching than filling in bubbles.
@ThaliaHibbs my only fear is that a sales tax makes those who can pay the least pay the most.
@TheQuestioner11 tchrs r responsible 4 ensuring the students' projects &amp; performances r collected in portfolios that r visible to parents

Prentice Cuts = 19,000 more students &amp; 2,500 less teachers. I wonder how this will affect class sizes? 
Prentice cuts = $500 million less in funding &amp; 2,500 fewer teachers. How is this good 4 kids?

@bmasonNDP sad that the Alberta Government can be used as an anti-model for teaching democracy.
When Jim Prentice said "everything is on the table", I didn't realize he was talking about Alberta's democracy. #ableg
I'm supposed to teach my grade 6 &amp; 8 students about democracy. How do I explain Jim Prentice's why-meet committee? #ableg #abed

Redford had no-meet committees. Prentice has why-meet committees. Both are an assault on our budget &amp; democracy. #ableg
@HanlonMike Mike, I hate it when you are right.

@mistisikes a mixture of maturity, exposure to books of my choice &amp; inspiring teachers
@MrP_tchr agreed. Too often we confuse compliance &amp; control with inspiring a love for reading
@MrP_tchr sometimes we confuse rigor with vigor
@MrP_tchr sometimes we forget about developmentally appropriateness
@MrP_tchr sometimes well intentioned people who love reading shove books down children's throats, turning them off of the whole endeavour
@mistisikes love it!
I grew up hating reading. I didn't read a novel until high school. I lied and cheated my way through chapter quizzes and book reports.

@mdroush let's go case by case -- somethings are worth salvaging. ClassDojo is not one of them.
@mdroush the default use is a behaviour tracking tool. That's how I assess it.

@rboon31 you're the Roughriders &amp; Oilers fan. You tell me.
If we coach differently when the game "counts", we teach children that winning counts more than learning and having fun.
You do not teach children to win by keeping score -- you teach children to win by coaching them to love to learn the game.
The problem with keeping score for young children is that parents get distracted by winning at the cost of player development &amp; learning
