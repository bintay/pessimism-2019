@severedelays oh crap - just read your trip not a holiday. Enjoy being with family in that case.
@severedelays Good on you for voting, insisting pet sitter votes and feeds the pets (well duh!). Have a fabulous holiday
Got up at 6.30 to vote with my partner before work. Everyone we saw was happy &amp; optimistic. Now I vote for coffee #ChangeInTheAir? #IVoted
Food for thought. 
@severedelays thanks for the heads up: we found each other :-)
#PITP Finale tomorrow. Picnic, music, sunshine &amp; possibly a teensy weeny  bit of a #StarWars theme. Come join us. #FunInTheSun
Haha. It really does look like a CAH card. #notjustanypants #MnSAgaingstHumanity? 
@StopKillingCycl @zoesqwilliams @bikes_vs_cars well said . Many cyclists ARE drivers &amp; visa versa. The infrastructure is poorly designed .
Just found a knitting pattern for a Cylon Centurion helmet/hat #BSG #nerdgasm #knitting
#isitok that when you had Clegg on last week I thought of this panel of #SensitiveKlegg from #2000AD? @TheLastLeg 
@meta_kresh yes. Drunken twat threatened me so I banned him from PITP. He starts thread &amp; LAM cronies lynched me so I quit
@RevDorianSilver yeah but cos I'm not part of #coolLAMgang my 6 yrs count for nothing. He kicked someone so I banned him but I'm evil :(
@RevDorianSilver there must be something in the air. I had a witch trial on FL so quit PITP :( f*&amp;!ing scene politics eh?
In a dark messy state &amp; haven't slept all night thanks to the #witchhunttrial that led to me quitting PITP.  Nice one. Hope you feel proud
#PITP on May 4th -Star Wars theme. This event needs a new host #onecarefulowner #sadtimes #4weeknoticeperiod
@severedelays 2pm till it gets cold or dark.  It'll be awesome if you make it :)
Showing the weeds who's the boss in the garden. Onto my 6th bin bag of weeds since starting this task. #GettingDirtyWithMyHoe #likeaboss
Just been to #stopkillingcyclists vigil for #MoiraGemmill. Brings back horrid memories of my partner nearly dying in similar circumstances
Attended this. Very moved by #DieIn. RIP Moira 
Highbury Fields: are you ready to rock? #pervesinthepark #pitp
Heading over now to set up. See you on the other side \m/ (*_*) \m/
Park!! Picnic! People! Music &amp; mayhem. Join us and jam. #pervesinthepark #PITP starts at 14:00

Very late reminder but #PITP is definitely on this BHMonday. #picnic #jamming #munch

@TweetStalkinGal Yes I fluffed up and said the book by Clough I meant about him - it was by David Peace #SorryWrongAuthor #EatMyOwnWords
@TweetStalkinGal Yup humble pie on my part - I meant the book about Clough by David Peace. The book's good but it grates a bit
Just heard that @RandomHand are not going to be with us for long  #farewell #gooutwithabang #gutted #seeyouinlondon
@thelastleg #isitok that we have not TV so have to wait till Saturday morning to watch your show on 4OD. Guaranteed laughter to wake up to
I fuxored my brain at work #killedbySQL #brainborked #tfifriday
Off to road test my new tires &amp; brakes. #cycling #hobbytakingovermylife
Gnipper the MTB now has slick tires, and I only have a minor injury to show for it. 1st time I've modified a bike.#AchievementUnlocked

I biked 11.38 km with @mapmyride. Check out my route in Holloway, United Kingdom! 
@MoogieFaroogie what do you want to know? Why we do it? How it works? Do DnDers actually get laid? How many dice are too many? ;-)
@MoogieFaroogie hey never saw this tweet but I do D&amp;D and White Wolf (Cyberpunk&amp; V:tM stuff.

@UAWomen So many comments on #gisele #IWillWhatIwant campaign nasty &amp; focus on her looks. They're not her only attribute. I am inspired.
I created a fitness goal on#MapMyFitness. Join me in kicking laziness in the butt. 
#nudeno Way too shy. Gotta love @thelastleg for making it a trending topic though
@severedelays It's in the "Ask a Female...(without being made to feel a jerk)".  After his post I cannot respond for breach of description
@severedelays 2/2 When we all know aggression =/= dominance &amp; some women actually find up front honesty &amp; politeness very pleasant :-)
@severedelays Not directly. Stoopid dude on FL trying to mansplain why dating IS a competition &amp; apparently all women dig aggression. 1/2
Why must SOME men need to #mansplain that "all women" are attracted to a certain trait in behaviour? NO: Variety is the spice of life. #STFU
I did a 22.78 km Bike Ride with @MapMyRide @sheridanwilde. Check my workout!

Working out is better with friends. Join me on MapMyRide today. 
Update on #PITP: I've got the booth near the fireplace. We can move to the conservatory later when it quietens down.
@adamhillscomedy No, those that are angry are morons. You did the right thing &amp; didn't send the idiots off to play martyrs. #Betterthanthat

@TweetStalkinGal Making examples of those caught short as opposed to actual criminals. #TFLFail #ShameOnTFL #TransportForLondonFail
@TweetStalkinGal Left my details at witness:TFL staff was unreasonable. Poor sod damned cos driver let him on despite card being faulty.
Guy on 29 bus gets on_spot_fine £80 cos Oystercard failed BUT driver let him on. He gave ID as soon as asked &amp; was 100% compliant. #tflFAIL
@multiclassgeek sadly not. Frame no recorded &amp; it's on #immobilise &amp; #bikeregister. Think she's gone forever though :( #biketheft

@sheridanwilde yup. Autocorrect corrected itself to autocockwomble. I seldom use that expression
Started a new job as a network manager. Autocockwomble changed that title to meteor manager. Now that sounds like a cool job! #AutoCorrect
A big thank you to all who attended Perves in the Park/Pub yesterday. Shame the rain got the better of us. See you in July #PITP
@IndelibleMarker park; sun's out :-)
@Stephen_LDN chuffin' 'ell tha's still gorrit reet enough! Tha can leave Sunny Donny, but it'll haunt thee fer t'rest o' t'days

#WeathercheckforPITP: Sunny ALL DAY until 7pm where might rain for 30 mins then sunny again. #PITP is on IN THE PARK! See ya there!
Who's coming to picnic on Sunday? #PITP #newkazoos #music #jamming
#PervesInThePark is only 8 days away. Let's hope the weather is a gorgeous as today's. #unsubtlereminder
#WGT2014 was amazing! Came home via Berlin &amp; found a wool shop next-door to #LastCathedral goth bar. Mead &amp; pretty wool makes me v happy.
ION: #schwarzbier ist lecker! I wish it was so easy to come by in London. #1stworldtouristproblems
Was sat on table next to Dan from #twoknottyboys &amp; was too shy to say hi. #notafangirl #shynesssucks
In Leipzig in a hostel full of goths. #WGT2014 about to start &amp; I'm too excited to sleep. #lotsofgoths #whatowear #sleepylionhostelrocks
@sheridanwilde it's a tough call but I'll take your tomato so long as I get to douse it in chilli sauce
Interview was great. Off home to pack, dye my hair (and OH's), hug cat then fly to Leipzig via Berlin. #WGT #howmanygoths #excited #holiday
@Dusepo I'm sure it wasn't meant that way but I put a lot into my events &amp; meet &amp; greet people in the pub too. Downgraded? Not really
@Dusepo fair enough but that comment suggests my munch was completely cancelled or doesn't qualify as a munch. As an organiser that hurts.
Plan B is not cancelling an event and is still hard work to run. Thanks for those that attended - I &lt;3 you all. #PITP
@Dusepo That is NOT the same thing at all.  :-( Plan B is Perves in the Pub! Still a munch! I specifically updated the event on FL
#PITP Update: Head straight to the pub. #HostessIsRunningLate. On my way. See you soon
Bad news Peeps: #PITP has to go to Plan B. #StraightToThePub Alwyne Castle, 2-7pm tomorrow. #RainRainGoAway Event updated on FL
Gah! Unstable weather making me nervous about BH Monday. #PITP is to go ahead but may need to activate Plan B #weatherwatch #helpmecthulhu
@votrefantome I would never be bored of black &amp; think I'm allergic to that shade of pink. #AmIAGoth #sweetofyou and on #WorldGothDay too!
@grasshoppertml I'm team Raphael but only cos it's one letter away from awesomeness :-p and I like red
@EWWO4TB my other half would be envious: green is his favourite colour &amp; yet when he tries colouring it green it won't take.
Day 2 after 1st bike ride in nearly 20 yrs: can finally sit down without yelping. My Little Whippet (bike) is so cute. I love her
Mid-year resolution: to go for bike rides early on weekends to build up confidence on roads. #backonthesaddle #mustgetfitter
I have a new bike - she's gorgeous. Going to take her for a ride tomorrow. I'll make the rocking world go round!
@flossieflooo Best of luck to all of you :-)

@grasshoppertml but did your light sabre pop out? You might want to YouTube that reference :-p
@grasshoppertml have you never seen Bo Selecta? Boo shank is akin to "well fierce" or sick but is so 2003. Making any sense?
Highbury! Are you ready to rock? You better be. Here come #PervesInThePark
&lt;12 hrs till #PITP Too Excited to sleep. Star Wars themed picnic &amp; jam session in Highbury Fields.
UK demand for asparagus soars by 540% over a decade 
@grasshoppertml but the bear is proper boo shank! You know nothing, young grasshopper!
4 days till #PITP. Star Wars theme for a bit of the day. #DanishOnEachEar Song suggestions peeps?
@grasshoppertml Woah! Megaflounce was mega!
@SecretlyVanilla @grasshoppertml  Newbie drama llama makes faux pas at munch, asks for feedback then flounces. redacted last tweet
@grasshoppertml So not impressed with Mr Stick Up Arse.
@grasshoppertml 2/2 My concern is how can you host an event if you can't even behave at one? Nice of her to check for other local events too
@grasshoppertml Hmm - 5mins on the scene &amp; she's hosting an event that clashes with 2 N  London events. Allegedly "spoke" with me about PITP
Hey guys one week till #PervesInThePark. Revenge of the 5th! Perfect post-StarWars picnic. #BringKazoos. Mon 5th May 2-10pm Highbury Park
Protip: Starting a new munch? Learn the lay of the land: don't triple book with other events, &amp; learn how to behave at munches 1st.
@grasshoppertml No not just you. Like I don't ask nillas if they like it up 'em doggy style 1st time I meet them either. #looksfornewstick
Changed my name based on back-handed compliment paid by a "friend". Apparently I have a masochistic saintly streak. WTF? #Frenemy?

The sun's out.  Bring bin bags if picnic blankets are not waterproof.  PITP is still on.  See you later filthy gorgeous people!

22 Days to go! Highbury Fields. Music. Picnic. Park. #PervesInThePark #BeThere
Say...did I mention it's only 3 weeks till #PervesInThePark? Oh I didn't. Well lets pretend I did. No Glow Cloud in this park!
@purrrrvert so sorry missed tweet &amp; spent all weekend applying for a job I really want. Hope it went well
@grasshoppertml How about some Black Keys - Strange Times maybe?
Got to share this. #AcousticDanceAnthems #ShowhawkDuo 
@athor333 I say! Never heard of them before but instantly liked their sound. Thanks! shall go find some more of Bitter Ruin to listen too :)
@purrrrvert Interested but terrified to do this on my own.  You going?
48 hours to go &amp; just shy of their target by £5K. End of the month no good: pledge now! Deadline is 2 days @coffeecakekiss #pledge4CCK
@MoogieFaroogie Latter - too bloody shy to go 1st time and regretted it ever since. Need to support these guys
I BEG you to support kickstarter #PledgeForCCK. SO close to their goal but only 69 hrs left. 
#NeedYou #ItAllCounts
@votrefantome Alas, I cannot help there.
@Herring1967 @jennyeclair Awesome. #touchingbeefs But where's the pedestal mat around your chairs?
@destructo9000 Not very vegan of you :-p Made me chuckle though
@votrefantome Or did you mean places to play the games? Forgot to mention #DarkSphere nr Westminster
@votrefantome What type of gaming? RPG? Board game? #OrcsNest is good, #LeisureGames nr Fichley Central is good too.
All you ever wanted to know about #PITP but were afraid to ask:

Really F***ing fed up and it's not even 08:20.  #crapstarttotheday #wonderingwhyIbother
@grasshoppertml CCK was a centrally-located, kink-friendly place that doesn't have exorbitant entry fees, served damn fine coffee &amp; cake.
So the AT-AT is apparently too skinny and was greeted with a "meh". #crestfallen #crueltytoATATs no more gifts for someone :'-(
#KnittedATAT up close. 
Finished him. #IckleBabyATAT 
@grasshoppertml Ha! Saw that episode &amp; instantly thought of you. :)
@destructo9000 Motörhead Leeds '98: tinnitus for a week but worth it. Or Apocalyptica London Astoria '08: Heavy Metal Cellos ftw \m/
@adamhillscomedy @CSYoung1 Adam, I think I love you (just don't tell my OH). You really crack me up.
What's all this talk of pancakes? Tuesday means only one thing round here: #DnD #TuesdayNightDnD (I know its Shrove Tuesday really)
@severedelays Well considering how much money and love has been put in so far I'd say hell to the yes! :-) #ToughStartingOverAgain

@MyMadFatDiary ETA: I'm twice the age of Rae in the show - not the actual, lovely, @RaeEarl :-) Can't wait till the next episode.
@MyMadFatDiary How do you do it? I'm twice the age of Rae yet the show feels like MY diaries from the 90s. Amazing, heart wrenching &amp; true.
Very excited as I just won a brand new mahjong set on ebay. Not the hidden tiles - proper 4player game #IAmTheEastWind
I'll be in my bunk - dying quietly of lurgy. ION: I rehomed some pretty Russian yarn, and met some cool people yesterday. #sickbutsmiling

@annieplayer Not all epileptics respond to strobe lights. I don't react to strobes but do if using a sewing machine (needle sets off fits)
@annieplayer Some animals can sense onset of seizures &amp; assistant dogs are trained to warn their owner of fits. My cat nags if my fits start

Protip: never tell your boss truth about being unable to come to work because your cat's dying &amp; needs vet urgently. #unprofessional #fired
@grasshoppertml  Make it so
@grasshoppertml Cont. Asshole drs need actual complaints for action to be taken. Ranting online won't change them. They should know better
@grasshoppertml Keep record WHO is doing it and consult GMC for fitness to practice issues. Complain to the hospital. Doctors are not gods.
Thinking of renaming my beloved cat as Chicago, the Windy Kitty. Cute kitty face is no excuse. #GasGasGas!
@grasshoppertml big hugs to you. So sorry to hear such sad news.

I got the #movinghouseblues. Been packing since 7am, van due at 2pm &amp; I don't think I'll finish in time. #escapefromcatford
1st day of freedom since leaving workplace with bully from hell. Feels so liberating. New job starts on 16th Sept. #startagain
Not sure I have the strength left to run PITP: just too much other stuff going on right now. Anyone want to take over for the day?
It's not every day I get glass bottles thrown at me and chased into the road by a random nutjob. Thank f***! #AnotherCrazyNightInCatford
#MyKindofMonday Listening to 36 Crazy Fists at full blast whilst number crunching/data cleansing. No pressure as I'm outta here in 3 weeks.
#PervesInThePark has a new home: Highbury Fields. Next one: BH Monday 26th Aug 1400 onwards. Be there!
@TheLastLeg #IsitOK that I accidentally found this Putin crab tonight after watching your show on 4OD 
#PervesInThePark: new location is to be Highbury Fields. Next event August BH Monday 26th. #NewBeginnings
Apparently Pushka doesn't do safe words when involved in claw play. #UnintendedPiercings #YouKnowYouArePwnedByACat
#PITP UPDATE: had to relocate slightly closer to the memorial fountain but nr usual spot: another party got their first. Tell the others.
It's the weekend, sun's out &amp; it's that time again. #PervesInThePark people! Today's the last one in Hyde Park so come make the most of it.
#PITP on Sat 27th July. Last one at Hyde Park. #picnic #jamming See you there!
New sport? Damn cute anyway. #CrowBoarding Russian Crow snowboarding: 
@sliderulesyou I just learnt that you need a licence to picnic £140 a go if 40+ people attend. I'm having to relocate PITP. Ridiculous!
Just a warning: #PITP may have to relocate after next week due to Royal Parks charging £140 for licence to picnic in the park for &gt;40 people
@MoogieFaroogie Did you make that? It's brilliant.
Have penny farthing badge, striped scarf now knitted &amp; black blazer with white piping: I am No 2. Where is No 6? #ThePrisoner
@destructo9000 I'd have thought Old Great One would be continuing his well-earned siesta. The heat's sending us all mad! Ia Phtang Cthulhu!
#ReplaceAWordInAMovieWithTampon The 40-year old Tampon, The Tampon Centipede, Trading Tampons, Tampons Are Forever.  OK I'll stop...for now
Please tell me #tampongate was a massive hoax. Confiscating tampons but allowing guns through. What the hell were you thinking, Texas?
Texas Officially Loses It, Bans Tampons and Diabetic Supplies from Senate Chamber, Guns OK 
Really?
#GreatBigSpider just walked across my pillows &amp; I'm in bed. Didn't scream or kill it but #NotImpressed. Kitteh now on guard duty
@russell_kane Me and my filthy mind. I misread that last sentence o.O
@SetoCheblakian in 9 days! Moving my chap from hospital 1st (long story), then my stuff after but can't get annual leave so will take ages
@SetoCheblakian Just off Holloway Rd, near The Big Red. Spitting distance from t'other side of Finsbury Park IIRC
@SetoCheblakian Awwww. They sound great - and they'll catch the buzzy lil feckers too. BTW I'm gonna be ur almost neighbour soon. Scared?
@SetoCheblakian I had a monkey pitcher, 2 venus flytraps &amp; another carni plant but all stolen from my window box. What else do you have?
@SetoCheblakian Awesome! Just don't let it become Audrey2.
Happy news: I'm finally escaping Catford &amp; moving in with Sheridan. New place in Holloway is gorgeous. Get keys in 9 days. #HappyHouse
#PervesInThePark next event: Sat 27th July 2-10PM. Same time, same place. Be there &amp; bring the Pimms! #SummerPicnicMunch #JammingInThePark
No PITP for June as too ill to run it. Next one is Sun 28th July. #PervesInThePark
Ever tried humming whist pinching your nose? Sounds like a human bagpipe. Try it! #randomBBCRadioScotlandFact
Something happening on BH Monday that gives a break from the norm? You betcha!  #PervesInThePark. 14:00 onwards. 
@grasshoppertml Isn't he amazing? I wish he was my grandad.
Any recommendations for where I can get New Rocks re-heeled in London? Can normal cobblers do this?
@MoogieFaroogie have a great time!
@SisterGraves pie-a pie-a Fhtagn!
Only 4 days till #PervesinthePark! The weather is going to warm up over the BH weekend. Come join us for the Picnic/jamming in Hyde Park
Once a bully on Kinklink 
Whose opinions caused a stink 
Both hostile and crackers 
He drove out the WACers 
Not really as nice as he thinks
One more week until #PervesinthePark ladies &amp; gents. Details: 
@IndelibleMarker Get well soon.
Are you ready to rock? #PervesinthePark has arrived. See you in the park.
#PervesinthePark tomorrow! So excited. Spread the word. Oh, and bring sunblock - it's gonna get rather warm! Any song requests?
Karl Urban lookalike boarded train &amp; is pulling an epic #Dreddfrown. My quest to get to Megacity for free #2000AD comic is fun.
What? No May the 4th puns yet? Surprised, I am. In other news it's free 2000AD Comic Day today
@ObscenityLawyer And quite right too. You are an inspiration to us. #notcreepyjusthonest
@sliderulesyou @cliterati1 shall definitely participate (but not via iPhone). I loved reading Nancy Friday's books. Deadline to submit?
5 days till #PITP &amp; 6 days till my new job starts &amp; 1 yr of S putting up with me (man's insane, I tell you). #happydays
@thes1lverf0x There was a soul trapped in one of those pints. I saw the pics! Hope the burden is easing now. xx
Only 6 more days till #PervesinthePark people! Who's coming?
I have a working mobile again! Huzzah &amp; hurrah. Taking forever to synch up but I have all my contacts so happy bunny
@MoogieFaroogie Thanks but I went back to O2 &amp; requested new IPhone 4 SIM just to be safe - not want to breach warranty etc before I use it.
New handset?yep. New SIM?Yep. Ah, wrong size SIM for iPhone. B*gger! #RackleHasNoMobile for next 3 days. can contact via email/twitter/FB
10 days till #PervesinthePark! Come feel the noize! Song requests? silly meme themes? bring it on, I say
Yey! New mobile has arrived - just awaiting a new SIM card so still incognito for another 24 hours.
Lost mobile phone so incommunicado for 48hrs. lost people's contact details, though my new phone on same no. Drokk Drokk and thrice Drokk!
I have a new job. Data Executive for a big media firm. Tasty pay rise too. #isittooearlyforchampagne?
@Beau_Tox @american_girlUK Sorry but Waaaahaaaaaahaaaa! DalekDom ahoy!
Bought a blazer because it reminds me of #ThePrisoner. Need to make No 2's scarf. Have wool, will knit. #NeedPennyFarthingBadgeNow
@Stephen_LDN Such a gentleman. Did she say thank you?
@grasshoppertml ooh do tell.  Did they remark on any similarity to another comedian? only teasing
#PervesinthePark is back. BH Monday 6th May 2013.  Spread the word my lovely people ;-) 
@sheridanwilde You mayor of the ward yet?
@CICCIO_36 @pasbaby Eh? I think you've got the wrong person. No idea who you are
#PervesinthePark will be going straight to Plan B: #teaclipper due to severe weather. Wanna making snow angels? ;-) Pls retweet
In-ward entertainment from 80yr old patient: keeps shouting profanities in his sleep &amp; flashing his crown jewels. Helps lighten the mood.
#PervesinthePark is still going ahead but shall have different hosts as I'll still be in hospital with S. many thanks to the volunteer hosts
Perves in the park, urgent plea for assistance: 
@grasshoppertml road traffic accident.  :-(
Hanging on by a thin thread. OH nearly killed but now suffering multiple broken bones. Just wish I could take the pain for him. So unfair.
I've just treated myself to a black ukulele. You have been warned! #PervesinthePark #aceofspades
Just been to album launch for The Evil Inside. Amazing! Want my copy now please. @breed77official
Psst. Perves in the park is back. Just saying. #PITP
@DomSigns cheers :-)
Handed my notice in &amp; start new job in April. Was wined &amp; dined to celebrate. #veryhappybunny
Positive side to epilepsy: the dreams I have whilst recovering. The Prisoner Vs Dredd, directed by David Lynch, and located in Peckham.
Jesus wept. Some site thinks by adding the initials of another wellknown site in their name it makes them the new #IC. Yeah, right!
@RandomDaveH @sarcasmatron_ I got one too :-/ can't delete it via my mobile either.
@Dorian_Silver This is very risky business but there is a secret skill/superpower that results in damage limitation #secretpowers
@Dorian_Silver TMI
Flying home fuelled by chilli, wine and happiness. Licence to goth about to be revoked #shamelesslyhappy
@tattyshoewhore haha! I knew it! I was sat upstairs right next to the door prior to the show. Was fun thanks. Hope you enjoyed the show too.
@tattyshoewhore You aren't by any chance at the Shaw Theatre are you, about to see Dilemna?
@MoogieFaroogie Onto episode 9 &amp; so rooting for the guy to escape. I'm so gonna make myself the scarf that No 2 wears.
@TweetStalkinGal @Dorian_Silver Ooh episode 7 contains hogties, chains, kidnapping. Yey! #lovinitforallthewrongreasons
@Dorian_Silver Sadly not. Youtube has several episodes uploaded.
Just started watching #ThePrisoner episodes &amp; am hooked. No6 is way cooler personality-wise than No6 from BSG. Want his blazer! #NotANumber
@katylady01 Oh snow that was awful! Really #scrapingthebottom :-p
You hear this? #PervesinthePark must be louder - so sayeth Auntie Beeb ;-) 
@IndelibleMarker @meta_kresh Sorry, existential joke backfired. Thought you knew each other from Sat U35s
@meta_kresh @indeliblemarker I often ask myself that too :-p. IM it's over to you!
2/2 Acting like a spoilt brat is making everyone's morning shit so just stop! F*ck you, #londoners. F*ck you all with a rusty claw hammer!
1/2 FYI I do not control weather OR TFL in terms of trains &amp; busses. I too am having a shit morning.
@MoogieFaroogie @mistress_nikki Hah! As good a reason as ever. I shalln't partake in the research as I hate the sound of noisy eating.
@Mistress_Nikki But its disgusting and has put me off my own lunch hearing colleague slurp for last 15 mins nonstop. Feel ill now :-(
Why do people eat so noisily? Does slurping really make your food taste nicer? Eat quietly you feckin' slobs! #hatenoisyeaters
In bed stroking my pussy whilst she purrs very loudly. #notlikethat! Just wish her claws weren't quite so sharp as I'm not up to acupuncture
Well that's 1 new job applied for &amp; afternoon spent job hunting. I'm sorry I'm too qualified to do proper work now. #hatemyjobsomuch
Annual appraisal mostly +ve but confirmed I'm overqualified for job so likely to be let go in June. Can barely hold back frustrated tears.
@sheridanwilde so how many places are you mayor of now? Just don't do a Boris will you? #verynice
So sleepy. Early night for me #RackleTheUberwuss
@La_Sarcasma PS. Sheridan says to wish you guys a happy new year. Is there a new yr Bah Humbug? That's what I'm saying anyway
@La_Sarcasma Don't tempt me! A raging Rackle is not a pretty site.
And so begins a new season of ill will &amp; misanthropy as stupid f***wits keep walking in front of me &amp; shoving. #watchwhereyouregoing idiots!
Oh dear. Put #toomuchchilli in my dinner &amp; still ate it. I have shakes &amp; feel dizzy. Gonna see if 40 winks helps.
It is with sadness I announce the departure of my skully brolly of doom. Still, my new knee-high boots will console me.
@retoucher_matt putting the c u next tuesday in Scunthorpe with that billboard?Why Scunthorpe of all places?times aren't that hard are they?
Tis the aftnernoon afore t'night before Xmas, &amp; I is pickled. Wrapping completed though. Result!
@tattyshoewhore @MoogieFaroogie Haha! Yeah I wrap like a bloke - no finesse but at least I try to make it neat and tidy :)
@tattyshoewhore @MoogieFaroogie Well isn't that generous of him! :-p I'm in the midst of wrapping up prezzies and am a teensy bit squiffy :)
@tattyshoewhore You too, sweetie! Hope you're feeling suitably festive :-)
#Xmaswrapping armed with a fine rioja and PushkaClaws assisting me. So excited about tomorrow. #bouncyhappygothmode
@katylady01 uber cute creatures. Wanted to throttle the narrator every time she said polar bay-ers though. I loved the ickle snow foxes too
@MoogieFaroogie closes tomorrow :(
@MoogieFaroogie yeah I'm on the mailing list. Meant to ask if you were aware too. Sad times
@MoogieFaroogie @tattyshoewhore ZOMG. #nerdgasm overload. I need one of each now!
@MoogieFaroogie @tattyshoewhore They sooo have to make a Space Invaders version now!
@MoogieFaroogie @tattyshoewhore I thought that was a Pac-man mug. Yeah they're similar.
Just treated myself to a Tetris mug that changes colour when tea cools down. Testing it in the office now #nerdgasm
@MoogieFaroogie Excellent! Keep them coming. #jokesyoucantputinxmascrackers
Anyone else got some bad jokes to share? #jokesyoucantputinxmascrackers
Why shouldn't you wear Russian underpants? Because Chernobyl fallout. #jokesyoucantputinxmascrackers
Grumpier than a grumpy thing. Not mopey:way more aggressive than that. About as cuddly as a Rottweiller in attack mode. You have been warned
Feels like someone has taken a morning star to my guts. Sent home from work as keep throwing up. Sick of being sick &amp; tired of being tired.
Day4: no longer errupting stomach contents. Instead have a mofo of migraine that only relents for an hour.  Having some great, weird dreams.
@grasshoppertml S'alright, Frankie.  We can soon fix that and have you back to normal soon. kthxbai
Think someone's trying to poison me, or they sneaked lactose in my food. Tummy feels like Mount Vesuvius today. hurts so much. Bleugh!
Got a mood like thunder right now. At least I've DnD to look forward to tonight.
Surprise surprise I didn't get it. Feedback was surprisingly negative &amp; useless. Done, done, onto the next one.
@thes1lverf0x Friday 23rd. Agency emailed earlier today saying there'd be an update this afternoon.
No news on interview: guess they've offered it to other candidate &amp; waiting for answer before they tell me I failed. #NoNewsIsBadNews
On night bus to Cockfosters via Hornsey Rise &amp; Spear Rd: good job I'm mature enough to not snigger at this. #rudeplacenames
@Sarcasmatron_ @grasshoppertml fankoo. Just playing the waiting game now to find out if I made it through to the final round.
@grasshoppertml Cheers. And to you, though I'm guessing we've both been through the process by the time this tweet gets through.
@IndelibleMarker well... Exciting for me is possible new job (results this afternoon) followed by Tanz Macabre. You?
@MoogieFaroogie shall do. Just need to wait for results now.
@MoogieFaroogie Muchas gracias. Tis over now &amp; I've no idea what to make of it. Could go either way #meh
@MoogieFaroogie Cheers. I'm all about the PMA. If I do well today I have a spangly new job. If not, l I'll have had practice for next time.
3 hours till interview. Nerves are steadied but not looking forward to assessment after the interview. Shall recover at #TanzMacabre later
@Dorian_Silver many thanks. I'm going to give it my all and just hope for the best.
10.30 interview so my body decides to shut down at 22:30. Now wide awake &amp; nervous since 3am. Waiting for shipping forecast to help sleep
3 days till interview. Feel like I'm a dirty Judas for not telling work, but then they should have treated me better in 1st place. #nervous
So who's Crunching tonight?
This time next week I might have a new job. Just got to get past interview &amp; assessment first. #timeforachange
@juliahattrick Hi: do you know me? Just curious
Gone back to protecting my tweets: some new peeps decided to follow me but no idea who they are or why. Would be nice to have msg to say hi
Interview &amp; exam on Friday!!!! There is a way out of this miserable work situation. Love the job but 1person keeps making life hell for me
@fruityloops_ May I ask about necklaces at the geek munch? I coveted one you'd made at last munch (naughty me) and since Xmas is near...
@grasshoppertml @fruityloops_ Ooh they were yummy. *flutters lashes* Geek Munch shall be even cooler than normal (which is pretty damn cool)
@fruityloops_ sure. If it makes it quicker, so long as there is no meat, fish, milk, butter, cream or gelatine all is well. Eggs are fine
@fruityloops_ Aye, S and I shall definitely be there. Ooh, all excited now. Nice to have something to look forward to.
@fruityloops_ @grasshoppertml gargling with salty water, eh? :-p get well soon.
I don't condone vigilante action so this apparently makes me the pantomime villain for speaking out. Boooo hiissss. #ExitStageLeft
Well the Internet sure brings out the ugliest traits in people. You've literally made me sick with your conduct but I'm the freak here
@shakti82 well that's EXACTLY how it reads! Two wrongs don't make a right nor do they heal the damage he did.
@shakti82 edit: turn on me for asking you guys to rein it in?
@shakti82 ... But when I say "this has gone to far" you turn none. WTF?
@shakti82 That is not the only type of malicious call. So it's on for you lot to make prank calls for one internet wanker...
@shakti82 well someone's traced his phone number &amp; is about to make a malicious call. 2 wrongs don't make a right
@shakti82 but it WASN'T a fact, and not even relevant to the thread in question. Yes I felt my integrity was incorrectly questioned
@shakti82 how is that exactly supporting? Or is it support one friend by degrading another?
@shakti82 if you are referring to my last tweet then I already stated: your baying at me now and trying to twist my words re: PitP
@MoogieFaroogie I feel like a character in a Franz Kafka novel: fighting to the end but it'll fail anyway
@MoogieFaroogie I need to stay strong &amp; support someone I love but my job is destroying me, so called friends turn out to be cyber bullies.
Life's like a FPS game where the more demons slain, the worse the new ones are. Don't want game over at all but this level is destroying me
So... Didn't get the Snr job but they want to create new DBA role for me with permanent contract &amp; £1k more than current job. Not bad, eh?
Interviewer didn't call back. Looks like I was full of fail today :-(
Now I feel sick, shaky and want to know. Will have to wait at least a couple more hours to know if I made it to the next round.
Pushka was howling at a cat in the front garden during my interview - hope the interviewer didn't notice. #InterviewFunNGames
interview 1 out the way. Interviewer was very pleasant and friendly. Just hope I made a good impression. Results this afternoon. Aaaaaagh!
40 mins into scheduled interview time &amp; still no call from interviewer. Impatient or bad omen? :-/ #JustGetItOverWithPlease
@firework_girl Cheer. 10 mins till crunch time :-/
I have an interview in 13 mins and counting.... nervous is an understatement
@ColinCaptain @russell_kane But otherwise happy about the dress? :-)
Six months ago I did something really scary but it was well worth it. Sometimes it really pays to #bitethebullet.
#Poorlybutveryhappy
Bloody Hell! Just found out that #IC is closing down. I stay offline for 2 days and THIS happens :-( not happy
Neighbours are partying hard. Only teensy bit jealous as I'm full of lurgy &amp; hiding under duvet. But I have #Pushka &amp; they don't. Evens out
This weekend I shall be mostly filling in a job app for a post that could mean a £11k payrise. That'll do nicely
Psst: I just got headhunter for 3 jobs! This shit never happens to me. Wonder what'll become of it #WhatsInHalfFullGlass
My thoughts go out to those affected by #HurricaneSandy: I hope you are all safe.
Still buzzing from #RandomHand gig. Pogoing did not reduce post-gig hyperactivity. Oi oi oi!
Off to see #RandomHand in Camden. Venue just sent emails to say the gig's moved an hour earlier so starts at 6pm. Talk about short notice!
@grasshoppertml @shakti82 affirmative  :)
#lookforlonger #75club. Oh wow! I'm about to submit my entry. Thanks for last 2 clues.
@grasshoppertml you star!
Just need to work out what the rat/mouse with cheese alludes to.
#lookforlonger only 2 to go now. Anyone gimme a clue about the rat and the flag? So close to completion.
@lookforlonger only 3 to go but stuck on tree near footballer, rat and the white  flag. Clues please?
@Dorian_Silver It turned out to be an awesome event: met some lovely people. Thanks for kind offer.
At my 1st London Bi Meetup &amp; as nervous as when at my 1st munch. Just heard someone in another group calling something 'well gay'. Oh dear.
@Stephen_LDN Not quite as much as when you wear your amazing rubber maid outfit &amp; do a ginger Freddie Mercury, but not far off! ;-)
Note to self: don't fall asleep whilst stood next to the railway tracks: it scares people (me included). #needsleep
Everything I say, do or even think is turning into shit today. I'm exhausted by it all. #JustOneOfThoseDays.
Please spread the word about this atrocious display of #homophobia by Greek police and politicians alike. 
#BritishGas have charged me for their faulty meter breaking. All credit on meter GONE, no refund. I hate you so much. #NotCustomerService
According to some wazzocks on IC, being bi means I'm programmed to cheat &amp; can't be monogamous. Lucky for me my man doesn't think that way!
Annual leave = sleep in late, shopping, and getting quality kitteh cuddles whilst browsing the web.#NotSmugReally
@MoogieFaroogie  S &amp; I are definitely going to #RandomHand gig so I need to book tickets. Wanna invite the others from the last RH gig?
@MoogieFaroogie Would love to but I'll be up in Ipswich "meeting the parents" for 1st time. Nervous is an understatement. Enjoy Gallows!
@MoogieFaroogie not got tix yet as only checked this morning. Will try and drag other half along as he quite likes punk too. cannae wait
@MoogieFaroogie Random Hand next gig 18:00 Camden Barfly Oct 26th. We missed JB Conspiracy at Dublin Castle, Camden in Aug. wanna go?
@MoogieFaroogie Whisky toddies? Purely for medicinal reasons, of course. ;-)
@saucyfuckinjack @grasshoppertml SOOOOOO glad you said that and not me (though I have thought it!) Too cruel!
@grasshoppertml Well you did ask... More fool you :-p
@grasshoppertml Either of the Proclaimers?
Having just seen #weepingangels for 1st time I shall never turn my back on statues again. #grownupsgetscaredtoo #doctorwho
@IndelibleMarker I always thought you were more of a Waitrose person than co-op. :-p
@PurpleKitchen Gentle hugs. Hope your hands heal up soon
@grasshoppertml I'm sure there's a double entendre in there about to burst out any time soon.
@SisterGraves Ugh! I'm going to have nightmares now. My eyes! Their eyes! Oh my little pony! That was almost enough to send me quite mad!
Squeee! My signed, limited edition, signed&amp;illustrated programme from @Herring1967's Talking Cock tour arrived today. Jealous? You should be
Aching from gig: didn't get back till 3am. Now off to see late show of #Dredd in PeckhamPlex. &lt;£10 for 2 instead of £32+ @Odeon. Yey!
@grasshoppertml like it's ever at a lofty height in the first place!
@Dorian_Silver but the evil vapours still waft amidst the trains/tubes &amp; still people get overly close. #HowToDryWretchDescretely?
Man on bus next to me smells vile: keeps farting &amp; stinks of stale sweat. Farting in public should be criminalised. #ThinkImGonnaBeSick
@grasshoppertml I'll bet you had to type that carefully! ;-)
@grasshoppertml You keep your grandma out of this - kinky sod! #KeepingItInTheFamily
@grasshoppertml Tsk tsk. Grammar! #NotSureIApproveEither. :-p
So excited about #RandomHand gig tonight. Bouncing around the flat in anticipation #PlaySomeSka
If people insist on saying totes, amazeballs and lol then I insist I get to use profanities. FFS. #StopSayingAmazeballs
@MoogieFaroogie Agh! Tis a pity as I'm in the mood for punning today :(
@MoogieFaroogie So what is today's pun-based tweet topic?
@SetoCheblakian black? Tis the new black again, apparently.
@SisterGraves Just booked our tickets so thanks for saying where you'll be. £32.50 for 2 adults?!?!? Jesus wept!
What's happening @ #EustonTower? Ambulances, fire engine &amp; mass evacuation with at least 1 person getting  medical attention.
I hate #Catford it's so unsafe. Followed by guy on bike making lewd gestures as I got off bus &amp; up my street last night. Had to run home :(
@gotye What about Death Metal? :-p
@MoogieFaroogie yeah yeah. You should have been vaporised a couple of years ago at least. :-p #logansrun
@MoogieFaroogie Nae bother. When is it your actual old git day?
@MoogieFaroogie What time are peeps heading to Big Red before gig? Sorry sent reply to your friends instead of you: still a n00b at tweeting
@SisterGraves think we're going to need somewhere more central as we've early start &amp; need to head back to N10.
@MoogieFaroogie Cannae wait! Wonder if I'll get the big bruises like last time at their gig :-)
@SisterGraves shall check with S tonight as to where is best. Will get back to you ASAP
@CressidaJL "we're only making plans.....for Nigel. We only want what's best for him" Hope it's salvageable. So want to see pics
Yey! Bought my #RandomHand ticket &amp; am going to pogo back to the office #HappyGoth #punktastic
@CressidaJL noooooo?!?!? Really?How do you rescue that? Good luck!
. ht ...
@SisterGraves Sheridan and I definitely  will be. No idea about screen times yet but Hell yeah we're there! :-)
Someone else gets their name published for work I did. When challenged about it, I get told to suck it up. Time for a new job. :-(
@katylady01 @CressidaJL Sorry for jumping in but try 
@grasshoppertml Not been announced yet but Nov. shall pass on details when I get them.
@grasshoppertml Dunno but saucepans make great hats, if you want to be a dalek.
@grasshoppertml There's the London Gothic Bring &amp; Buy at Tufnell Park. Held every other month. Lots of art/craft/alt stalls. Ten pounds a go
Still in happy buzz mode from this w/end. Thanks for all that supported #PervesInThePark as it means the world to me. Is it really 3 years?
@votrefantome sorry about 30 mins behind schedule &amp; stuck in Muswell Hill. On way. Meet at top of hill.
#PervesInThePark Sorry guys I'm running late. Meet at top of Primrose Hill - we shall camp near there but that's nice easy meeting point.
#PervesInThePark is STILL on! Plan B in case of downpour is The Pembroke Castle, nr bridge next to Chalk Farm Rd. See you all tomorrow!
@grasshoppertml Thanks for that caveat, I did wince &amp; wonder. :-p
@grasshoppertml doh! Have you tried it and is it any good? #curiouslactoseintollerantvegetarian
#KnittedDalek on my desk getting nods of approval from staff. He shall oversee my work until Oct when he is given a new owner. #Extermiknit!
@grasshoppertml So it's bot pronounced as Frankie then?  :-p
@Dusepo indeed. There were 3 tweets in a row that horrified me so I've stopped following this person. It was disgusting
Tweeting casual racism does not impress me. For this reason I'm out and no longer following you. #RacismIsNotCool
@poggs So are your hats getting increasingly larger? like an inverse Russian Doll? Why so many hats?
#PervesInThePark is on BH Monday 27th Aug at Primrose Hill 14:00 - dusk #NewLocation Come join us! Spread the word. Details on FL &amp; IC
@MoogieFaroogie Also how awesome is this? 
@MoogieFaroogie saw this &amp; thought you might like: 
@SisterGraves aye, I was admiring those too. That site has many things I want. Distracting me from work now :-p
@SisterGraves I want some of these: 
@Dorian_Silver @sistergraves Well that plus 2000AD. Scary collection! Can't believe there are comics older than me in there.
@SisterGraves I'll pass on the comics, thanks. Sheridan's collection predates me! Been helping him archive them. Still yes to film though
@SisterGraves I'll bet my OH wants to go see Judge Dredd so I'll probably go but have no clue about JD.
#StepAwayFromtheComputer Douchbag online trying to be intellectually racist but doesn't like facts or evidence. Wish I was Darth Vader now
@MayorofLondon  So having been cleared of every charge,with 100% Jury agreement, will you be re-hiring Simon Walsh? #porntrial
Am relieved to say migraine almost disappeared &amp; I'm a human again. Also excited as I've nearly finished making a TARDIS as geeky gift.
Migraine has finally f***ed off. ION #SomeonePutAGagOnSharapova: she sounds like a fox in heat. It's so annoying!
@Dusepo Thanks for making me smile. What odd instructions
@american_girlUK been to A&amp;E twice this week cos of epilepsy. I'm loaded up on meds but it just isn't shifting. I just need to ride it out.
I feel pathetic: 33 yrs old &amp; actually crying cos this migraine won't shift. My eyes hurt so much &amp; nothing will make it stop.
Another Clobazam to the head! now feels like flu. At least the breakdancing has ceased. #epilepsysucks #needbraaaainss Back to land of Zzzz
My emergency epilepsy meds are called Clobazam &amp; contain valium. I've been Clobazamed! Double-vision &amp; spaced out but no fits for 2 days.
@Stephen_LDN Might also be a good idea to find out who keeps FLaping your profile on FL. Unless you bat for the other side now ;-)
I must be the only person in London not watching the opening ceremony. No Telly no care. #somethinghappeninginLondonbut cantbesurewhat
@Dorian_Silver hope they settle into your system soon. I'm in similar situation with my meds: turns epilepsy into narcolepsy at the moment
Only one day till #PervesInThePark! New location: Primrose Hill (Camden side). Bring sunblock!
I'm attending this Meetup 
Shared event with mini #PITP next Wed 25th July
@grasshoppertml I'm sure you'll be great. Catch up with you tomorrow at #Crunch
@grasshoppertml Hope it's not too late to say it but very best of luck!!! Fingers crossed for you
A little short notice but who's  up for a post-work mini #PITP munch on Wed 25th July @Primrose Hill, Camden? Details to follow on FL &amp; IC
Make them stop please. I'm going to be violently sick. I swear they must eat dog food as it smells so foul. #PublicFartingShouldBeBanned
I need an NBC warfare suit: person behind me on the 134 keeps dropping their guts. I'm dying here. #PublicFartingShouldBeBanned
@Beau_Tox Moist sounds far ruder!
@SisterGraves So long as it doesn't make you bankrupt, I think you know your answer
@SisterGraves Would it make you happy (regardless of if you wear it or hang it as a display piece)? I know I would in your shoes. :-)
@Beau_Tox Aww loook at the ickle kitteh trying to be scary. Boo!
@spacecheetos So pretty. Wish I knew how to keep 'em in place without my piercings getting in the way &amp; had confidence to wear them
@RenaissDesign nice tag ;-) strictly ales only or can stouts,porters and milds feature?
@IndelibleMarker Been working that on that pole again? :-p
@grasshoppertml That's cos your mixing up your nose &amp; feet. Feet for running: nose for smelling. Not t'other way round :-p
@grasshoppertml Nae bother, was just poking fun. Hope you feel better soon. Olbas oil might help the congestion.
@grasshoppertml And your reference for this simile? they ain't fun you know
@athor333 Is that meant to sound wrong or is it just my warped little mind?
Update on Perves in the Park: 
Support #LibelReform by signing the petition 
@Dorian_Silver 'fraid so. My mind is in the gutter (but I'm looking up at the stars)
@Dorian_Silver So let me get this straight, you're publicly asking me to stroke my pussy? ;-)
@Dorian_Silver bashing the device against the wall with her paws
Clever kitteh has learnt to override the timed cat feeder by bashing it about till the lid pops open. #miffedbutimpressedby kitteh
@firework_girl it was failing to load up for me until 5 mins ago. cannae be bothered to see if there's a surge in tweets
@Dorian_Silver dunno mate. I'm taking annual leave &amp; paying for this myself as its personal development.
Off to do SQL course with #HappyComputing. I love training with them as they're cool, ply us with coffee &amp; ice lollies &amp; are über friendly.
@MoogieFaroogie there's folk out there who'd gladly do it free &amp; for the glee it brings being evil (not me cos I'm nice, no really I am)
Having one of those months where I feel like it was all smoke &amp; mirrors. Moment of clarity &amp;maybe time for new job? :-(
Planning on hosting #PITP on July 8th as Olympics &amp; Hyde park events on all other July sundays. Anyone up for it?
@grasshoppertml oh look: Ronny's on telly. Pthhhht! :-p
#SheWantsRevenge were amazing! Floating home from gig with huge grin on my face.
@missee2bizzy of course I realise: just such a scary &amp; grim way to do it. I feel for those dealing with aftermath aswell as the poor soul :(
Jumper on Jubilee Line. Always gets me down when people try to end things that way. So unfair on driver &amp; witnesses. Feel glum now.
@meta_kresh 3.5 IIRC #DnDStuff
Is no longer a D&amp;D virgin &amp; my halfling helped kill tentacled beasts. A productive night all in all
@grasshoppertml And there was I thinking ickle baby cheebus was trying to skullf*** you. Need mind bleach yet? What about eye bleach?
@Dusepo @grasshoppertml Ew Ew and Ew again.
@grasshoppertml Well that's Jesus punishing you for suggesting to f*** him!
@american_girlUK expression of frustration, instructions or observation? ;-)
Haha! Had to point some naked riders in the right direction for the #LondonNakedBikeRide as they'd veered off course. Lots of naked bods.:-)
@grasshoppertml I didnae say you need to touch any Poles ;-)
@grasshoppertml It's not my fault ya look like him. Blame your mum: she know any comedians about 20-odd yrs ago? :-p
Off to Hyde Park to be a freak by keeping my clothes on &amp; walking. Support #LondonNakedBikeRide
@SisterGraves sorry to hear things are rubbish. Hope the opera cheers you up.
Following my last, who on earth is @DaveDaPirate? don't know anyone with that username but requested to follow me
Wish Twitter allowed you to send messages to ask who the hell these people are that request to follow you. Usernames are not helpful
@grasshoppertml @tweetstalkingal Wooooah there! I wasn't even there. You can't hanfg that one on me.  Not my fault that you are #FranksTwin
@sad_antinomy It's going to be sunny in the afternoon! Shall keep an eye out for you. I'll be the weird one with clothes on &amp; no bike
Going to the #LondonNakedBikeRide tomorrow- not cycling- but to give (im)moral support. This is gonna be weird but fun. Who else is going?
@Beau_Tox Best of luck mate.
I informed as many people as poss with as much notice as I could yet you still bellyache on FL, on twitter and FB. Thought you were friends?
Not appreciating all this bitching about cancelling PITP: if you want to go to the pub then fecking go. Run your own event too whilst at it.
@grasshoppertml Well it came across as snarky and I'm pissed off about cancelling too. I put a lot into this as you all know
@something_robot @grasshoppertml I'm hardly celebrating: no need to get nasty at me for it. :-( I don't control the weather
Pls copy &amp; paste my tweet re #PITPcancellation as I cannot unlock account via iPhone. so sorry for the short notice &amp; wish it didn't rain
#PITP is cancelled as the ground is sodden &amp; won't dry in time. I take no pleasure in cancelling this. Take  your beef with me offline
Very sorry but #PervesInThePark is cancelled due to bad weather. Pls retweet &amp; let others know. Just wish I could control the weather.
@Dorian_Silver Meanwhile I'm working the nonemoreblack look.
Time to dye. Hair, that is. later peeps
Only 2 days to go till #PervesInThePark. Miss it and miss out on a fun day out.
@SisterGraves I'm far more sensible and go to them at 6pm on Tuesdays instead &amp; it's just round the corner from work. Subvert &amp; moan I say
Yey: #Gotye is playing in London in November. Boo hiss: tickets are nearly £30 without booking fee or p&amp;p. #shouldIreallypaythatmuch?
@retoucher_matt Perving over bins? I thought I was twisted. :-p What's so drool-worthy about kitchen bins then? Made from obsidian?
@innocentlb Noooo. I need human slave to waft fan for me. Far more decadant, dahlink.
@innocentlb It's that weather alright, but as I'm on the ground floor, front of house, I cannae do that. Need to employ a slave to fan me
@Dorian_Silver  Indeed, one paw to rule them all... sorry wrong film. Heil Kitler
@thes1lverf0x You don't know half of it mate. She is soooo my mistwess
Well.. apparently I'm going nowhere just yet &amp; typing with lefthand a s there's a cat sat on the right one.
@thes1lverf0x Hell yes. Very witty, very funny and lots of references/ nods of approval to previous war films.
ION: Is Iron Sky out on DVD yet and who's getting it? That film was amazing. So glad I saw it, even if it was silly o'clock at night
@grasshoppertml Hello Mr Pot: you met Mr Kettle? ;) Hey it's not often that I get dealt a good hand of cards in life. I'm just going with it
On one hand it's back to work tomorrow: on the other, only 3 days to go till  S gets back to UK.I'm a smitten kitten.:) #DoesntItMakeYouSick
@grasshoppertml Sure - send you're CV my way. You got my email address?
@Dorian_Silver Thanks but there's not much that can be done. I'm gonna self-medicate with a glass of vino destructo instead.
Seriously fed up with #LewishamHospital &amp; their awful patient care. Neuro quack is over 1hr late &amp; is not listening. Even more pills now :-(
One week to go till #PervesInThePark. Let's hope the weather is as gorgeous as it is today. I've been learning cheesy hair metal: beware!
@Dorian_Silver I don't, but I might just have to spotify that since it would make a nice addition :-)
Today is #HairMetalTastic. Def Leppard, Little Angels, Motley Crue, Extreme. They're my guilty pleasures &amp; I'm revelling in them. So ner!
@Dorian_Silver Very kind of you to offer but I need to increase the blood in my alcohol stream a little. :-)
@SisterGraves Opted for evening of Apocalyptica &amp; knitting.Tempted by cocktails but that means going to the shops in search of booze
@Dorian_Silver O RLY? How? And why didn't he go ahead? &lt;more to the point who the devil is Macus?&gt; Questions, questions, so many questions.
Please tweet about #anythingbutEurovision. #Losingthewilltolive reading about this sodding event that I would rather not hear about.
Bad Rackle. Only meant to go to Camden to get the train home. Not supposed to buy dress on the way to station. #ButItsSoPretty
Went to Highgate Cemetery today &amp; said hello to Douglas Adams, Karl Marx  &amp; saw some amazing headstones. #GothClicheButSuchFun
@grasshoppertml Is you dissing da Molko? He was so fit! Even if he's lost the locks these days, he still makes me swoon. #StoptheDissing
Rackle is #PiningForTheFjords. Well summink like that. Think I might go take some needle &amp; yarn and make stuff whilst sat in the park today
Come with me to this Meetup for London Gothic: The London Goth Meetup Group! 
@meta_kresh @votrefantome Anarchy in the UK? Shame I can't play them but hell yes I'll try learning some Sex Pistols for #PervesInThePark
Not long till the next #PervesInThePark!  Just saying, like. Any song requests?
Iron Sky was awesome. On annual leave till Tuesday. Only mildly jealous that my chap's gone to WGT but life's pretty chipper at the moment.
@SisterGraves maybe. Will check with S as he's heading straight to Gatwick afterwards for WGT so we're a bit short for time.
@SisterGraves @grasshoppertml @saucyfuckinjack @dorian_silver Ah. Tickets sold out hence we're seeing the 22:50 showing.
#PervesInThePark next on Bank Holiday Monday 4th June 2012 14:00 Hyde Park near Diana Memorial Fountain. Be there! #jamming
Oops I did it again: singing along to Lovecats on the train forgetting that no one else can hear The Cure. "into the sea, you and me..."
@thes1lverf0x Cool: I love that song. Come play it at #PervesInThePark! I can play Babylon by David Grey too.
@grasshoppertml @sistergraves Which screening you going to? S &amp; I are going to the late late showing #spacenazis
@thes1lverf0x so long as it's not Stairway to Heaven ;-)
Stil not had breakfast &amp; am starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Does booze count as breakfast? Maybe Guinness? #easilydistracted
My man's just bought me a set of clear purple, geeky RPG dice &amp; a Cthulhu dice bag. Squeeee #nerdgasm #HappyGoth
@grasshoppertml earplugs? #sarkycow
I don't care if Monday's blue, Tuesday's grey &amp; wednesday too. Thursday I don't care about you. I'm in a rediculously fluffy mode &amp; it's ace
@MoogieFaroogie maybe its because I'm an atheist: but I'm not intending to cause offense. The stone is as real as god then. :-)
Walk the (Lay)Line #superstitiousmovies
@MoogieFaroogie kissing the Blarney Stone IS a superstition thought to bring luck so my contribution is still valid. ;-)
Sword in the (Blarney) Stone #superstitiousmovies
Freaky Friday 13th #superstitiousmovies
(Black) Cat's Eye #superstitiousmovies
Not Crunching tomorrow, but not because of the volume (happier reasons). Still in #CheshireCatGrin mode.
Here comes the rain. Here it comes again. #ShamelesslySingingToTheCult
@grasshoppertml Only if their first name is Empress ;-)
@votrefantome @grasshoppertml Well Thanks to that thread I'm listening to the soothing sounds of Combichrist. #EnjoyTheAbuse
@grasshoppertml How do you think I feel?I've been diplomatic until I was basically told "suck it up and buy earplugs". One less cruncher now
In a motherfucker of a foul mood. Apparently I'm not allowed an opinion. Well kiss my ass you cliquey precocious 'p(r)etty people'.
@grasshoppertml @sistergraves Nooooo! Still, I had a good reason for not being there :-)
@SisterGraves @grasshoppertml I missed that?!? Damn! Still, there'll be other times I'm quite sure ;-)
@MoogieFaroogie haha that's even better /more embarrassing. I've caught myself dancing bleepy-goth stylee before now too.
Ever forgot you've got headphones on &amp;  sang along to music only you can hear? Me on the tube listening to The Cure. #ThatWasEmbarrassing
@grasshoppertml  One of the two I was going to recce on. :-(
@grasshoppertml  Gig = The Moon minus their inept drummer. Venue: Railway Hotel, Bromley.
Gig was disappointing, venue creepy &amp; all I know is I won't play there. Wish it was Saturday already
@Beau_Tox so switch things about by being a bit of a cock at times ;-) simples #fixeditforyou
@american_girlUK Fingers crossed for you. Let's hope the interviewer(s) felt the same enthusiasm too
Can't stop smiling. That is all :-)
@SisterGraves ooh sounds awesome! Yes please :-)
@SisterGraves Really want to go but tickets likely to sell out before I can confirm. So want to see moonnazis film *sulkystrop*
@thes1lverf0x I'm a laydee! Certainly no pics: what sort of a perve do you think I am? Don't answer that!
So excited about tonight - its like being a teenager all over again. Grinning like there's a coathanger trapped in my mouth. #BouncyHappyMe
@grasshoppertml Hahaha! So funny. So you shall henceforth be known as @creepyhopper :-p
@grasshoppertml and sometimes it does actually pay to admit to having them &amp; the persons involved :-D  #NotGuaranteedToWorkEachTime
@meta_kresh I got it on with someone I fancied for ages after I bit the bullet and told him. Normally that sends folk running to the hills.
@RandomDaveH Thanks Dave. @meta_kresh I have no contact details for Bryony: presume you do? 
Shall MSG attendees re green bag.
Woke up at 6.15 after  &lt;5 hrs sleep. Nope, the silly grin hasn't gone yet. #CantBelieveThatHappened this never happens to me. #HappyGoth
@something_robot @grasshoppertml Indeed! W shall make it so :-) Pennie needs to play along too.
@something_robot aw I love that you come to PitP as you rock!
@grasshoppertml don't think I can see that: maybe I need to follow Charly to see the tweet? Smug face not even close: Cheshire cat grin :-D
@grasshoppertml not sure which RT you meant (twitter n00b). No worries: I have a big grin and that's all that matters :-)
Just a bit o drizzle fo shizzle. See you IN THE PARK. Plan B only IF the rain gets bad. #PervesInThePark
Hyde Park are you ready to rock? Too bad, we're coming to rock the joint anyway. #PervesInThePark
There's a drunk guy on the 185 who think's he's channeling Elvis Presley. #ElvisLivesInDulwichApparently
Last tweet about #PITP from me. 14.00 Hyde Park, opposite Serpentine Gallery, nr carpark &amp; Diana Memorial Fountain. Are we ready to rock?
One day to go till #PervesInThePark! The weather WILL hold out and fun shall be had. Come to the dark side: we have cookies and music
@SisterGraves awww that's adorable.
Someone on the train keeps dropping their guts, the dirty bastard. #feelingsick
@votrefantome Why wince or why pretend I'm a grown-up? Blame it on masochistic tendencies :-)
#Vote2012 is going to be painful viewing. Dodgy graphics making me wince already. Still, I have to pretend to be grown-up.
@grasshoppertml Oh Gawd 'elp us!  Nah, I'm happy for you. Just marginally green with envy.
#PITP This BH Monday. Hyde Park 14:00 Get your ass there or miss out on a whole lotta fun. Or I'll have to keep singing as a forfeit
@DomSigns Don't cry: we didn't mean it really :-p #DomlyBehaviour101
@DomSigns and our survey says: ah ah :-p
Sat in Starbucks on TCR where last week's chaos was. Microbiologist to the left &amp; doctor to the right. #IFeelStupid but I can haz coffee
@grasshoppertml what happened to Mr Smug-face Esq?
@grasshoppertml "the only thing worse than being spoken about is not being spoken about", Oscar Wilde (slight paraphrasing)
@votrefantome Think I'll need to set this as a permanent reminder. I like it.
@american_girlUK Don't make my bottom lip wobble :-( sniffle sniffle
@grasshoppertml @Beau_Tox You calling me addick? you startin'? eh? eh?
@american_girlUK Yeah, exactly.  you hear that people: I'm kinda sweet :-)
@Beau_Tox Come on you reds!!  and ner ner ne ner ner to @Beau_Tox
Waking up in bed next to my guitar, having fallen asleep whilst playing with it is not a pervy statement. I'm innocent, I tell you!
@poggs Awww bless ya. &lt;pats head&gt;
To those who read my blog: its not an invite to guess whodunnit. I'm hurting, but I'm not stupid. And I'm not a sub godamnit: I switch.
This is driving me nuts. 4 hours I've been crying now. The deeds are done &amp; in the past. Why should one pic affect me so much? #MakeItStop
@DisguisedQueen Hugs to you too, darlin'. Seems like we've both been have a tough time as of late.
That feeling of nausea after you've spent the afternoon in tears? Yeah that one.  #nastyimagesbringbacknastymemories
@grasshoppertml If it's any consolation I've had to do late night vaccuuming as the light in my bathroom exploded on impact with the floor.
Snow Leopard has arrived but I cannae muster the energy to install it yet. mañana methinks #ProcrastinatorExtraordinaire
Anyone coming to see She Wants Revenge in London in June? My ticket is on its way and I'm a happy bunny.
@grasshoppertml  Ah gotcha.  I'll just have to pass on the link to other Cthulhuists another way. No probs
@grasshoppertml Loving it. How does one retweet something after favouriting it, or is that not possible? #TwitterN00bFail
@Stephen_LDN Are we talking extra strong tea or three men one mouth here?
@something_robot @grasshoppertml What are the other 7? :-D Go easy on him- he did do a heroic deed &amp; a feat of engineering to help a damsel
@SisterGraves Indeed there are :-)
@retoucher_matt You've got some of those type of robots haven't you? Enjoy the movie.
@SisterGraves Hey, @grasshoppertml and I agreed to meet under Freddie Statue at Tottenham Ct Rd as he is going around there anyway at 4ish
Not a Damsel in distress anymore as @grasshoppertml is a true knight in shining armour.
Plea to SE Londoners: Over 5' 6"/ have a stepladder? Light blown in bathroom, I have no ladder &amp; light fitting is 3m up. #DamselInDistress
@Stephen_LDN I read that as you needing eye bleach: surely nothing shocks you into a trance.
Suddenly I feel a lot perkier. Devious plans afoot, and I can almost almost play "No One Knows" on the guitar now.
@SisterGraves @grasshoppertml Cool. since the meds increased yesterday I may well have to forgo alcohol so this plan works well
@grasshoppertml Bit late to the tweet but I'm at a loose end tomorrow afternoon. May I tag along?
@Herring1967 completed survey and donated under my real name as I think it's awesome what you are doing for Scope.
How cool is this? 
@Stephen_LDN Aw ickle bald Inego. Can't imagine it.
@Stephen_LDN So not in the office then, eh? Just keep the kittehs at bay. My kitteh lurves latex &amp; it's difficult to keep cat fibres off
#TCR I doubt the mass hysteria about bombs is helping calm those working in and around that area. Settle f*** down &amp; stay away. Simples!
People tweeting #TCR Settle the f*** down! Some of these are simply fantastical. Unless you have the facts stop speculating. Muppets!
Restringing my pwesciouss is almost as cathartic as prepping ropes. Must have been a cat in a previous life. #RackleLovesRope
@MoogieFaroogie @tattyshoewhore @stropwaffle @PuzzlerT @jasonbstanding 
Room for a wee one? (It's Rachael btw)
Time for tentacle pr0n yet? Shhh at the back, Cthulhu's sleeping. I&lt;3 Cthulhu.
(*v*)
 ;;;;;
@grasshoppertml only sometimes?
@SisterGraves Ia! Ia Fhtang! shall book ticket and head to London Bridge for 6ish unless you recommend getting there earlier?
@Stephen_LDN @Mistress_Nikki Send him to the naughty bed! (ie get your scawny bum home and rest up you muppet!) I concur with wise Nikki
@SisterGraves I'd love that! What time does it start?
I've been given a dead mouse for my birthday. At least somebody loves me #IHaveTheBestCatEverEverEver
2 fits in 1 day: how not to have a birthday. Work were lovely and chauffered me home. Off to bed to recover. #reallysickofepilepsy
Stupid me forgot my meds last night so had a mini fit at work. Birthday trainwreck calling at all destinations & soon arrives at Messville
Want to erase last night but it's not possible. Not playing at New X again & shall never let anyone get close to me again.#sadmadanddeluded
Whose gonna be mad & support my birthday jamming sesh tonight? It features songs about zombies, a messy heart, a one-eyed girl & a stalker
This morning has just improved 100 times over: just treated myself to #SheWantsRevenge 's album: Valleyheart. It's amazing!
Killed a phone and a light & its just gone 6am. This does not bode well. Dare I even do my open mic set tonight? #stagefright
Great: bathroom light's blown - no window & light fitting is 3m off the ground. Need stepladder or very lanky person Help! #damselindistress
iPhone has died & I can't transfer data across from mac until I upgrade to OSX Lion. Can't do this over internet it seems. So not fun. Arse!
@grasshoppertml no way Jose. However, I am planning to go to the Intrepid Fox with @SisterGraves cos it's my Old Git day. Wanna join us?
@grasshoppertml Objection: you have no material witnesses to testify this. No further questions, Your Honour.
@grasshoppertml And your evidence for this allegation? Not guilty M'lud. :-p
@DerrenBrown go for it! Most definitely approve: it suits you well.
@grasshoppertml Don't you EVER make comments about my use of puns again! #scrapingthebarrel
Tee hee “@Lord_G_Almighty: And on the seventh day, God said "EEK, DINOSAURS!" and bombarded the Earth with meteors.”
Dangerously upbeat for a Monday morning. Been bouncing around to @breed77official 'insects' to wake up. #MetalInTheMorming
@Stephen_LDN Aw hun.  Big (lurgy-free) hugs.
@Stephen_LDN You have it?
#SongsThatGiveYouGoosebumps "Heart's a mess" by @Gotye. Takes my breath away each time I hear it.
Oops. Dunno if I'll regret that... &lt;walks away from the crime scene whistling&gt;
@grasshoppertml  You kinda know about this one already. It's the do I /don't I do something about 'Nilla With Teeth' scenario.
OK, ignore my tweets for the last 24 hrs & blame it on sleep deprivation. It really messes with the brain. I have a new scary quandry now...
@american_girlUK Erm...tbh the latter. just can't see the woods for the trees today. Meh. I'll be ok. thx for the hugs.
Having a bit of a weepy Sunday. Brought to you by John Legend: Ordinary People #songsthatmakeyoucry
@american_girlUK Pretty. I think the "l" is bratting a little and saying "I'll flower when I blooming well feel like it"
@something_robot Pics of work in progress? It sounds amazing.
Bleak thoughts as epilepsy is fucking up my life. I don't want to die - just want this to stop. The meds don't work they just make me worse
Not sure what's causing them but I'm having a lot of sapphic dreams at the moment. Sadly they are far too tame to fully enjoy.
Think I'm gonna curl up in the bathroom when I get home. so so ill. #talkingtogodonbigwhitetelephone
To whoever shat themselves on the District Line Westbound, not cool at all. Nearly threw up at the stench #nastysmellsontrains
Not likely to make the Crunch. 3rd seizure in 3 weeks: I swear the Grim Reaper is training up a sniper &I'm the practice dummy. #deathonlegs
@grasshoppertml what?  Why? :-(
Thanks TfL for this morning's clusterfuck @London Bridge. Overcrowding -&gt; panic attack -&gt; tearful wreckage of me. #IHateCrowds #IHateTfL
Heart's a flutter: head's a mess. Mind's in the gutter with ideas in excess #indecisivenesswillkillme
@RandomDaveH @grasshoppertml cos we're shy! Srsly
@grasshoppertml Fear not, we came to rock this place, and we shall! Kudos for being mad enough to get on stage with me. #dirtyrockstars
@Beau_Tox Big hugs. Hope the sh1tstorm passes soon.
@grasshoppertml hey! Absolutely no pressure intended. You're invited, not obliged. Fret not (my job as guitarist is to fret) #badpun
ION: Say I'm not the only one that smirks & thinks BSG each time 'fracking for gas' comes up in the news. #frakyeah
@grasshoppertml Don't give the game plan away. I'm gonna have to have a backup plan now. Girl With One Eye maybe?
Sorry, last couple of tweets were directed at @grasshoppertml
... As a surprise change of style, I meant to say
I only know the 1st of those on the guitar. NewX policy 3 songs each. I'm doing a Gotye cover & maybe the 'lalala...' song from PitP as  ...
@grasshoppertml you get your ass to New Cross.At least give it a try. Maybe we do a Black Keys number? #Youknowitmakessense
I could die a very happy bunny right now. @breed77official you were amazing. #floatingbackhome but lost my voice a little
Too late: am in Borderline now. Besides, I'm too old to be a twue gwoupie these days. #scrapheapchallenge
I spy Breed77 in the Intrepid Fox. Too shy to say hi :-( #notagroupiejustafan
Less than 60 mins till @breed77official play live. Squeee!!!! #uberhappymetalmodeactivated
@grasshoppertml cat scanning, with real cats!
@vis_a_vis6969 Little person icon (you) near new tweet button. Select drop-down and then Direct Message. Should then be able to see them
@grasshoppertml Now we both know the latter part of that statement is a lie. Sorry you feel so low. *hugs*
In other news. Fancy a bit of drama today? 
Oh but they do! And I deserve to be punished :- D »30 on tea/coffee is not normal is it?
I've been very bad and spent an obscene amount of money on tea, coffee, belts & shoes. #girlygirlindenial
@grasshoppertml but less hassle than killing people.
@american_girlUK @beau_tox Now are we talking actual kitchen gadgets, or implements that look like that but have other uses? ;-)
@grasshoppertml Oh go on, twist my arm then. Harder damnit! I might change my mind again :-p
To U35 or not to U35 tonight; that is the question(amongst many others, no doubt). #indecisive
@athor333 Have you no shame? That album was just meh... May I prescribe Death Magnetic - Metallica returning to their roots
@ProfBrianCox Aww that's adorable. Squeee. Anyway..back to the science
Oh FFS. Just lost 4 hours due to a seizure. Now head hurts like hell. I can has new brains pls? #brainfail #epilepsysucks
@american_girlUK Best of luck: I'm sure you'll do well. Hope you feel better soon too. Lurgy sucks.
Dreading #Friday13th tomorrow? I had interview for my current job last time it happened. #NotVerySuperstitious
@Stephen_LDN you sure that's not time for horn o' clock? That is insanely early for any activity not worthy of horns. :-(
Anybody coming to see #Breed77 Acoustic gig on Mon 16th Apr at Borderline, London? Just booked my ticket. #metal #gig
@Herring1967 Yet they tweeted you about it?  Take it as a compliment ;) Their loss if they've never uttered AIOTM & seen the reaction.
#10favouritebands The Cure, New Model Army, @Engel, Placebo, Cult, Pink Floyd, The Bluetones,The Black Keys, Stabbing Westward, Joy Division
I have a new superpower: can impersonate volcanoes via my mouth. Need to learn to control this & find a use. #lurgysuperpowers
@grasshoppertml Will swap spoons for bodyparts: feel like I've been crowbarred. My superpowers aren't so super
@grasshoppertml Basically, you need a tool kit, right? You need a specialist type of kit/standard-sized screws? #HasToolsCanLend
@EngelPropaganda When are you guys next in the UK - specifically London? Can't wait till Blood of Saints comes out.
Ninja kitteh is losing his skills: just caught him trying to break in & steal catfood. Puska just went "meh, whatever"#NinjaKittehFail
@grasshoppertml tweet that to the QI Elves: they are on here :-)
I am the lurgy monster.My superpowers are groaning in pain, fevers, and creating green goo out of nowhere. #AttackedByASnotGoblin
@annieplayer @innocentlb @spacecheetos @Mollysdailykiss @swage Yes and thanks for your kind words. :-D
@grasshoppertml You still not home yet? :-/ Delays on the train or just usual sub-standard SE trains?
In the park, under the trees, about to unleash my guitar on Hyde Park. Are you ready to rock? #TisABitDampButItllDoNicely
#PervesInThePark is not cancelled & we shall not become gremlins. Meet us under the trees. #britishstoicismatitsbest
Today is a good day for wearing PVC or rubber. Pretty & practical. Just saying #practicalperversions
@votrefantome I could hug you right now for such stoic support of #PitP
@grasshoppertml lucky I saw this: leave the drum as I think Plan B is becoming more & more likely.#MotherFluxingRainRuinsPlans
Didn't sleep at all as too nervous about #PervesInThePark today. I can't control the weather but I intend to make this a blast all the same
@votrefantome yey! That's the spirit! Might want some waterproofs though. see you later
Apologies, the rain-related songs was possibly wearing a little thin. Thanks for those that took part and made me giggle.

@meta_kresh OK this has upped the ante somewhat. I propose "Gimme Shelter" by Rolling Stones
#SongsAboutRainOrWeather  "Here Comes The Rain Again", "I'm only happy when it rains", Little Umbrellas (Frank Zappa)
Always take the weather with you (Crowded House); In the same Deep Water As You (The Cure); Nice Weather for Ducks #SongsAboutRainOrWeather
@votrefantome These are the best ones so far! :-)
More songs for #PitP  Teardrop (Massive Attack), "Nightswimming" (REM), "Today I woke in the rain of blood"(Combichrist) keep 'em coming!
@meta_kresh Nah! These are good ones.  Keep 'em coming
#WeWontTurnIntoGremlinsYouKnow
Any rain/water related song requests for tomorrow at #PitP? "Naked in the Rain", "Raining Men" perhaps? #WeWontTurnIntoGremlinsYouKnow
@votrefantome No, but our aim is improving all the time! ;-) See you tomorrow in t'park?
@grasshoppertml 'never gets old' unlike me? What you insinuating boy? Cheeky sod. I'll slap you for such insolence!
@grasshoppertml Except if I'm in conversation with you! 'People' think I'm going all cougar & I promise I'm only being friendly. #NotACougar
@EroticMeet wow thanks! The pleasure was mine. I'll be back again for sure
@DerrenBrown @thenumnum I dunno, these sweet-talking tweet stalkers, eh? ;-)
#PitP IS GOING AHEAD tomorrow!  If/when it rains THERE IS PLAN B. Next person to tell me to cancel it shall be maimed. Spread the word!
Is it wrong that I've watched 4 episodes of #bigbangtheory back to back?  #geekgasm Should really go to bed now as its gone 5am
@something_robot We must must do this one too:  
@something_robot Here's something to consider covering on the uke: 
@something_robot @grasshoppertml does the hostess with the mostest get to play? ;-)
@something_robot And you're bonkers enough to do it! May I add some Specials covers to the mix?
@something_robot Clever! You now realise you are obliged to play at PitP. No matter how much the fountain begs to be played in! Tis the law
@charltonbrooker the dark Chocolate and wasabi sounds amazing. I shall have to try this!
@grasshoppertml Not me. Feel like I had the proverbial kicked out of me so too poorly.Think its @Shillibeers nr Kings Cross IIRC?
I've just joined an epilepsy support forum: they said I'll fit right in. #postseizureblues
@grasshoppertml need cowbell: more cowbell!
@grasshoppertml aw thanks for that. Bringing your sticks on Monday?
Perves in the Park (Unplugged): 14:00 Easter Monday at Hyde Park, London. Be there! #picnicinthepark #jamming
@grasshoppertml those aren't the order of your actions as a result of splitting them are they?
Off to perform some saucy poetry at the London Erotic Meet (Soho) in a couple of hours. Very nervous but excited.
@RandomDaveH  You sick pervert, you!
Jamming at New Cross Inn tonight. Might throw in a surprise. Join us!
