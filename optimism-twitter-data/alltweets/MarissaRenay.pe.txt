@PowerUpDoe lol thank you &lt;3
I hope my asshole neighbor revving up their douche-mobile and yelling at 3am gets into a non fatal but very vehicle damaging car accident.
Today is my half birthday. If I were 7 this would be a big deal.
Don't judge me Netflix of course I'm still watching 
Sleeping boys are precious Angels <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I need a life that involves less of vicariously living through fictional characters
AND FUCKING FINALLY
I've watched 10 hours of this show just waiting for these two characters to make out.
The older I get the more I see myself being single and spending my days talking to a 12 pound chihuahua
The cool thing about cuddling Charlie is I always get to be the big spoon which is a rare occurrence for me 
Should I get chipotle or make adult food at home
I am a pretty princess today 
I miss a lot of things because I wanted to move away to be a reclusive twat
My mom just sent me a picture of her and my brothers going to out or her Mother's Day dinner and I may have cried about it like a lil bitch
I just watched the most awkward sex scene of my life maybe I should stop watching tv now
I like how he matches his shirt with his red solo cup 
I think I have an old man crush on Oliver Peck
In need of a hug. Charlie doesn't have very bendable hugging arms
I wish Charlie could talk :(
Having a bad case of "I'm a real person with feelings" today so as a solution I've only been awake for 5 hours.
@FakeWang thanx babe
new tattoo <VICTORY HAND>️ 
My "owe getting tattooed hurts" face. 
@FakeWang may the force be with y'all <VICTORY HAND>️
@FakeWang is that a comfortable way to sleep
@FakeWang is that dude sleeping backwards
@nightxwulf I was being sassy and you didn't get it &gt;:(
@nightxwulf don't feel too bad, you personally can only physically do one of those things
I think I've exceeded the amount of days acceptable to not wash your hair.
When you're 72 weeks in trying reaaaalll hard not to accidentally like anything
"What do you think about to get rid of a boner?"
"Math mostly"
I need an adult to go look at cars with me :(
He might actually be the worlds largest chihuahua idk
My chihuahua is a hardcore mother fucker
Bought Charlie a "looooooong lasting bone" made for large dogs and 15 minutes in he's halfway through it.
All caps? Okay then
My tattoo tomorrow is the CUTIEST <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
And by back I mean back, not dick because I guess those get confused
Someone marry me so I don't have to work so much I'll scratch your back or something
• have a daughter 
• name her Stacy 
• be the mom that's got it goin' on
I unearthed some old Blink shorts and I'm pretty excited about it 
<NEW MOON WITH FACE> 
I went to kill a roach with the broom but I think I just gave him brain damage before he ran and hid.
I wonder if Parker reads books. I bet he reads books
Always a good time seeing The Story So Far <RELIEVED FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I don't have boobs so I'm just jealous really
This girl crowd surfing is in her bra
PARKER IS THE CUTIEST
Did your mom drive you here
Okay I guess it's fine but don't rub yourself on me. I don't even want my sweat on me.
There's always that one guy at shows who feels the need to take their shirt off.
Put your sweaty flab away please
Could seriously cry someone please kill me with my shears
I've never wanted to quit my job more than I do right now.
I want to marry and have babies with Brand New
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>I love you so much that it hurts my head
I don't mind you under my skin
I'll let the bad parts in, the bad parts in<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Switched shifts to get out of closing, ended up having to close anyways
Loopy as heck.
@FakeWang sorry bb <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I think I'm seeing The Story So Far tomorrow but idk @FakeWang might change the location again so I can't find it
I just was to make everyone listen to @ThisIsPVRIS
@JBaaalls lmao you were so sassy :(
@JBaaalls you kicked me out of your car once, always messaged me trying to fight, called me ugly several times????
@JBaaalls have you not met me?
I was kinda mean to the qt @ f21 who was trying to talk to me about letlive but like I just woke up from a nap &amp; Im still kinda mad about it
@whosrobertseed I recommend it to people who enjoy bad movies.
@katreenawhh the feeling is mutual <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS>
about to quit my job via group text
This song <RELIEVED FACE> 
Is there a way to die and still listen to Purity Ring
The girl at Starbucks was really pretty and it bummed me out a bunch
I'm Mexican everyday like on uno de mayo and dos de mayo
@FakeWang quit toying with my emotions
<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Can I buy a boyfriend
My credit score is 740 can I buy things now
@FakeWang get a bouncy house and charge extra
Was having a rough morning and then I thought of this @Vassarrr &lt;333 
Sad girls club party of one right now. If you wanna cry you can join I guess
@jordynmarquez that was a beautiful offer &lt;3 teach me yoga so I can stop taking Xanax :(
I feel like I rant about this too often.
Feeling great for a month and hopeless and suicidal the next 3 is the absolute worst. Depression is not circumstantial.
There's is nothing beautiful or poetic about not being in control of how you feel. Having a bad day is not depression.
What my life already looks like  
Happy birthday the the guy who brought Star Wars into my life some 5 years ago, @sammykpalm! <DANCER><PARTY POPPER><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
My mom is ten times cuter than yours 
My name is Marissa and I like to purposely read things that annoy me
Forgot I made a tattoo appointment for Friday <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Really though it's a catchy song 
My neighbors are listening to Pony on repeat.
(His nails actually are black btw)
Charlie at the dog park being antisocial like the weird emo kid who listens to Dashboard Confessional and paints his nails black
@_Norma12345  
THEN asked if I had a boyfriend but assured me that he wasn't hitting on me because he was married
THEN asked me to trim his neck hairs closer to his back and said they looked like his pubes
Asked one of my clients if I had the cape around his neck too tight and his response was "no but I like being choked"
@FakeWang jerk :(
@FakeWang gross
I just spent $15 on a slice of cheesecake and a muffin. A bagel was $1.50
Sick tribal tats bro
There was one bagel left and the old man ahead of me got it :( now I have to act like I came in here for cheesecake
Do people who put "single" in their bios do it so people know it's cool to hit them up or like as a life choice kind of thing
Honestly didn't need to watch the fight when I have Twitter. Some hugging went down and Mayweather is still undefeated.
@MeredithhhG I did one of my friend and I and it said he was 78. Clearly no accurate! Haha
Yo that Abilify commercial with the little pill helping that lady get out of bed always gets me in the feels
@underscorewermz downloading things just isn't as easy as it used to be <VICTORY HAND>️
Its 2015 and I cant find a stream online for this fight that wont download 12 viruses and allow a demon and its family into my computer
Someone with the fight FaceTime me and set me on front of the TV.
@MeredithhhG I have an old lady face :( lol
I like living alone but paying to live alone kills my soul
Gee thanks 
It's always a good day to not be pregnant.
I have an hour left of driving and I really needed to pee like 30 minutes ago
@lt_danzig I'm not happy anywhere so I'm sure I'd learn to hate it eventually <DISAPPOINTED FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@lt_danzig as are most big cities
Had to pull over to get all the bug guts off my windshield
I didn't want to drive down here and now I don't want to drive back home and I'm just full of internal conflict
@JBaaalls you always ask on my days off lol I've never told you no though and you never ask for it for free so you're good! Lol
@PowerUpDoe I assumed you were being sarcastic :p
Okay end my rant and all my spelling errors <VICTORY HAND>️
@PowerUpDoe if you want to come to my yob when I'm working hell yeah I'll cut it!
Not trying to help people out who only hit me up when they want something from me from me<VICTORY HAND>️
ALSO tired of friends who only hit me up when they're in town and want something. No, you and your homies I don't know can't stay with me.
But when I'm visiting home on my day off its a chore and I'm sorry it's not at the top of my to do list <HAIRCUT><PISTOL>
I hate that I can't go anywhere without someone asking for a haircut. I appreciated being thought of I appreciate people saying they'll pay
Kinda want die so I don't have to work anymore
Not looking forward to the drive back up to Albuquerque
Why am I not living in Austin is my real question
@eriidizzle like the fact that I was in cruces yesterday and that happened puts a sad lump in my throat <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Des is one of the few people who fully understands my love for Alex Gaskarth and all time low. She knew me when I was 13.
Cruces I'm in you. Please no one hit me with your car. Thank you
@FakeWang because I left town?
@FakeWang if that's what you want <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@FakeWang and then you can get one of these 
@FakeWang 
@jordynmarquez you didn't even say the 3rd Bloody Mary before I said "no Jordyn turn on the light!" Hahaha <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
My 10th birthday present is getting her middle age spread now. 
I'm reeeeeallly excited about the new poltergeist <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I hate Catfish. Basically just people getting mad that they were talking to a fat person instead of a supermodel.
Was gonna go home but having some mental issues idk about to start crying at the glasses store
I look like a doofus today
@StayingxTrue probably not cutting hair while I'm down there. Just tryna chill :/
An entire week of feeling like the life has been sucked out of me is not tight. 
Where the fuck did my energy and ability to breathe go
ALAMO TOMORROW CRUCES ON THURSDAY
Listening to the Spice Girls while showering is the best way to getting pumped about showering.
I just want to watch Brand New every day. I think it's the cure for being glum.
I just don't like Scarlett Johansson
If Charlie had his way he'd chew on my ankles until they bled
3am just thinking about all my bills.
Taco Cabana with bae
@Princess_Taytor not if you let the purple fade out a bit. It'd be a little process but not impossible.
@Princess_Taytor this was only coloring it purple once over this red 
@Princess_Taytor my favorite color I've ever had so far and it goes over red really easily!
I need to go home for like a month and not be an adult.
I had a lot to do and took a 5 hour nap instead
MY NEIGHBORS BLARING SHITTY MUSIC AGAIN THATS IT IM MOVING
I haven't tweeted today. I'd like to take this moment to apologize to @_Norma12345 for laughing at her misfortune.&lt;3 you the real mvp
Thank god for @katreenawhh being there for all my late night existential crises <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS>
Anxiety overload.
100000% done.
I hope my neighbors get robbed and someone steals their sound system leaving in its place a note saying "you're an asshole".
@hollycheyenneee I think she's the cutest mom I ever had.
Nicole Kidman is 47 and freakin beautiful 
@FakeWang how is that relevant to what I just said?!
@FakeWang maybe <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>she just confessed this cute little secret to me today.
My mom gets Alternative Press emails so she can keep up with what's going on "in Marissa's music scene". <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@Princess_Taytor have you seen that show Stalker?!
@Princess_Taytor I'm not caught up on this season :-( maybe like 3 episodes
@Princess_Taytor I would stop watching of they called off Reid.
I think I found childish gambino on tinder and also this guy who looks like a good time 
@birryonaire I have to have all my tattoos covered at work but I don't think he was very good at math.
As an adult looking back I feel like playing on the Monkey bars took some serious skill
I legit look 14 with long sleeves and no makeup.
Had a client today who asked if I was born in the early 2000s. 
Specifically 03'.
I am not mentally capable of sexting and pictures of my butt can only save a dying conversation like 2 times before I give up on talking.
It's really hot in my apartment and I'm really close to throwing an tantrum about it
Bae is Charlie btw
When bae keeps trying to eat your chili cheese true and you gotta be like "bae stop trying to eat my chili cheese fries".
The Virgin Suicides gives me all the feels every time.
Every time I see this picture I love her more 
American Beauty is a fucked up movie <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@iGr8Dane that's a great idea.
My dad won't drive 3 hours to see me because it's too far but 10 hours to party on a boat nooo problem.
<AUBERGINE><EAR OF MAIZE><BANANA> realistically we should be using the banana
I never realized how big eggplants actually were. I should choose a different emoji to represent dicks
"You kiss like a fish!"
Just trying to watch all the Freddie Prinze jr movies
And I was like "<CONFUSED FACE>"
Watched a movie last night about this 19 year old who made her life all difficult by getting involved with older dudes in relationships
The other couple in the theater probably thinks I'm on the verge of killing myself.
Just saw a sappy love story alone at the theater and best believe I cried about my life during it.
@Hammafer I didn't have 20 when I got here!
I'm the only one in this theater I totes could have brought Charlie. 
Lol I should have said 50 RT 20 was too easy :-(
Was one retweet away from taking Charlie with me to the movies
20 RTs and I'll sneak my dog into the movie theater
Sometimes I'm just overwhelmed by how cute Charlie is <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Charlie looking sad af 
They put a cone on my baby <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> he's just getting his nails clipped <CONFUSED FACE>
Some girl took a picture of one of my tattoos and put it on her Instagram <CONFUSED FACE>
@FakeWang L.
the cool thing about doing things alone is deciding you're going to do something and not having to consult with anyone
@FakeWang touché. Continue on then.
@FakeWang it's not polite to take pictures of strangers children.
@katreenawhh AND I FEEL LIKE YOUD EASILY BE ABLE TO GET A LOVELY APPRENTICESHIP BECAUSE YOURE LIKABLE AND TALENTED OMG <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@katreenawhh I'm super excited for you because I know you'll be amazing at it! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE>️

#Seriously
@katreenawhh I'm really happy about this <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS><TWO HEARTS>
Idk im just not about things related to anal
Just googled what truffle butter was
I started listening to Drake and Charlie left the room.
When bae keeps smudging up your glasses with their nose and you gotta be like "bae stop smudging up my glasses with your nose".
Can't get over last night <DISAPPOINTED FACE> 
@jordynmarquez I like your eyebrows!
@katreenawhh this made me uncomfortable
I got my Charlie a bone as big as he is <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@_Norma12345 it would be so instant you wouldn't even know what happened! You'd just be dead. Lol so I wouldn't stress about it <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@_Norma12345 if the earth moved it'd either freeze or burn!
@_Norma12345 we would die as soon as the earth moved. The sun is in just the right spot to keep us alive without killing us.
@_Norma12345 besides the gravitational pull not allowing us to fall we'd probably fall into a worm hole or something like that. Lol
@_Norma12345 she's a weird hippy lol
@_Norma12345 what theory?!
When your coworkers talk mad shit about each other but think they're bffs. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I just want to watch Brand New everyday :(
Seventy times seven <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
There's no parking in my apartment complex but my happy hasn't worn off yet so I'm chill about it.
Oh wait it's flowers on their mic stands
Brand New is going to play with fucking flowers on stage.
"Fuck you Anthony Green!" 
-guy watching circa survive
The girl next to me just did a random ass hand stand. She's either going to be real weird during this show or real cool.
I have butterflies that's how excited I am about being here <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@HammerDev this is definitely has to be why no one dates me <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Realized today I've gained 20 pounds since my freshman year <NEW MOON WITH FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Also my neighbor was listening to Taking Back Sunday on her balcony and I want to be her friend now.
Brand New is in my city. I'm gonna cry.

@_Pthuggg <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I wore an All Time Low shirt and blue skinny jeans my first day of freshman year and I was just extremely satisfied with myself
I just want to be known for my all time low obsession that lasted from 07 to 2010
@seraphinaxos I'm super excited too! I've been listening to them nonstop for the last week <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I understand my dislike for certain people more when I realize they're a Gemini.
@ashleylbay oh yeah I remember that! You're a brave soul going to a beauty school!
@ashleylbay I regret getting that dumb a line cuz it took forever for the back to reach the front and now it's just taking forever to grow
Some lady said my makeup looked professional like I should work at MAC and it warmed my little heart <SPARKLING HEART><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@seraphinaxos we should go to this! 
@FakeWang babe
It's almost been a year since my Lucy died :( she would have been 15 <DOG FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@zackaIope have you ever seen the kids in love video, uncensored? It's my all time favorite video by any band ever.
@FakeWang but I love you or something like that
@FakeWang wanna come manage my life
Feeling all the nostalgia 
Chipotle needs to be 24 hours and have a drive thru
I can't do laundry without getting taco cabana
That one outdoor house show where Des and I smoked with strangers and I asked a random dude for his pizza. Good times.
Living alone is the best thing ever because it's a place where you can be naked and weird and messy and no one can judge you.
Taylor Swifts mom presenting her her award is the most precious thing ever <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
When your tinder matches start getting salty and you have to unmatch them 
I just want to be in a time when Taylor Swift still sang about the teardrops on her guitar.
I just want to see a game in the cowboys stadium because that shit it huge.
Should I get chipotle? Fav for yes or ignore for yes
I just really love Hayley Williams. Like a lot a lot
You can think of me when you forget your seatbelt and again when your head goes through the windshield <ONCOMING AUTOMOBILE>
I'll be in the presence of Brand New in 48 hours. I'm too excited.
If I fall asleep right this minute I'll get exactly 8 hours of sleep
Reasons why I'm single 
If you fall out of this roller coaster it's okay because you'll end up at Taco Bell 
Missing the family @ashgoooo_ <WOMAN>🏻<WOMAN>🏻<WOMAN>🏻<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@whosrobertseed they all probably forgot. Lol
@ashleylbay I would seriously love to go to Portland lol <TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS>
Jessica Alba in Good Luck Chuck makes me feel extreme secondhand embarrassment
Open Water 2 gives me serious anxiety.
@ashleylbay lol! Yes we're adults now they should totes hire us!
@katreenawhh @dustinr3ed we could watch bridesmaids and eat burritos <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
There is a colonial woman on the wing. There is something they’re not telling us. She was out there churning butter.
I moved his bed by my makeup table and now he's taking a nap :') 
Finding a new car is bumming me out. I shared a lot of good times with my car :-(
Talking to my dad realizing why he Dions was more important to have in my speed dial.

Eating hanger #12 
I'm in an abusive relationship with my dog.
He got them off the coffee table while I went to wash my face
Fucking pissed 
I miss Des soooo much <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@JosephxHHT I really like this one!
I think he thinks he's hood or something. I don't think he knows we live in a gated community.
Charlie was making a shank and left it in my bed 
I respect Charlie's tenacity but also I don't think I'll be getting my security deposit back. 
He loves me <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<DOG FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@lovestaspooge is that a real ad or some shit you concocted?!
I swear my bathroom isn't always this cluttered 
@hollycheyenneee who do you go to?
@cherrychanti I did lol I was confused at first and then informed her I did it myself <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@cherrychanti she was like "and you got your makeup done here too right?" Lol<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
The lady at sephora tried charging me for getting my makeup done which was awkward because I put my makeup on at home. <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
The qt working at f21 complimented my Silverstein shirt and I felt like I was 15.
MY LAST NAME ISNT CARTER FOR THE LOVE OF JESUS
On my way to steal your bitch with my fancy lil chipotle ring 
Getting so stoked <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
No worries though I'm just making room for this summers crop tops.
Got $40 selling my collection of crop tops to platos closet.
@xcadaverx probably about as often as the eggplant has been used to talk about eggplants <AUBERGINE>
@xcadaverx 
I also need to shower but it's so far from my bed. I need shower motivation music.
Dions or chipotle someone help pls
It's 3am which means I'm sad for no reason. I can go buy an egg mcmuffin in an hour though.
Poor Charlie.
@FakeWang all I do is love you and this is what I get in return
I'm going to grow old with Charlie because he's the only one who puts up with my attitude. Granted he doesn't really have a choice
WHY AM I ALWAYS SO GRUMPY
@purekatierose I'm totally kidding btw. I love him more than myself!
Charlie and I are matching and I had no idea until just now <SKULL> 
1 week until I see Brand New in all their live glory <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I miss house shows. Those were cool
@seraphinaxos OMG have fun tell me how it is!
Let's play "Is this a Halloween shirt or normal everyday shirt?" 
Next month <OK HAND SIGN>🏼 
Selling Charlie. Good cuddler but eats hangers and dry wall. Hmu if interested
Too sensitive to be this jealous.
One time I cut @kgrhymes hair and he let me keep one of his sets of the original Star Wars trilogy. <NEW MOON WITH FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Second, I'll take eight 
THIS IS A GOOD DAY TO BE ON TWITTER
#BB8
#C3PO

Where do I get these Star Wars emojis?!
I have a lot of feelings about this trailer <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
@whosrobertseed seriously my question right now.
@JosephxHHT where did you get a storm trooper emoji?!
Spooning with Charlie is my favorite part of life <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><DOG FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<FORK AND KNIFE>
@sammykpalm you kinda do <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
My $30 pasta was seasoned with poison  
@jordynmarquez I feel nauseous as fuck <SKULL>
UPDATE: may have received food poisoning from the fancy pants casino restaurant
Also my car smells like weed and I'm pretty sure there's some in this sketchy hole in my door.
Went to a fancy pants restaurant in a casino and ate really bland, small portioned, fancy people food.
@cherrychanti MarissaRenayXo :-)
It's 10 and I'm ready for bed. I should take up doing drugs or something to do in my spare time.
@katreenawhh im super bugged because it's not even like normal just hanging out jammin loud it's like I want the who complex to hear this.
They're listening to The Weekend now.
My real question is who parties on a Tuesday. Like I have work tomorrow and these assholes are turning up to t swift.
THEYRE LISTENING TO TAYLOR SWIFT SO FUCKING LOUD. I DIDNT KNOW T SWIFT SONGS HAD SO MUCH BASS
My neighbors are turning up so fucking loud right now my walls are vibrating.
@_Norma12345  
@FakeWang cool promoter
Why 16 year olds look 25 nowadays bugs me. Go back and be ugly with bad eyebrows like the rest of us.
<SKULL> 
Idk 
I'm shaking I'm so excited. I never thought I'd see Brand New <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
IM SEEING BRAND NEW THIS MONTH I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I'm about to blow a sad amount of money on a Brand New ticket
@FakeWang Omg I forgot about that band
This tweet almost came with a sad butt pic 
Add me on snapchat for pictures of Charlie and me doing this thing with my hand: MarissaRenayXo 
I'm the epitome of butt hurt right now.
When you keep asking someone something and they keep changing he subject like you're not going to notice that you didn't get an answer <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@JBaaalls I'd seriously spend the money! Where at?
@lt_danzig I would spend $80 no problem but I also don't want to buy a fake ticket :(
They sold out so quick <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I would seriously consider sexual favors in exchange for a ticket to see Brand New here on the 21st.
Or like you can have my first born.
After seeing Madonna makeout with drake I would just like to sincerely apologize to everyone I gave unsolicited kisses to. Please forgive me
<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>  
Saddest little clam there ever was
Tryna go to Tempe next month
@hollycheyenneee the highlight of most my days off are that I get to go to target.
I'm irritable as heck.
@hollycheyenneee Albuquerque <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
"22/ Tattoo collector<SYRINGE>/ inked model<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏻/ taken by @boyfriendwithfacetattoo<COUPLE WITH HEART> <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️"
Im equal parts intimidated/annoyed with really pretty tattooed girls.
Not calling my mom today. That should teach her to yell at me over the phone about something I did like 9 years ago.
I want that choke me tattoo <NEW MOON WITH FACE> 
All I ever eat is chipotle and dions.
If I hurry and shower I can still get chipotle before they close
My mom is legit yelling at me for something I did when I was 12. Like she's legitimately mad at me right now.
Sometimes I just get super overwhelmed because I love Charlie sooo much. Like I want to squeeze him.
I saw letlive and it was cool and nothing got broken. 
Like I feel like I skipped being 17 and only took one picture that whole year and it was this one. 
I'm a Jason butler fangirl <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@FakeWang gonna stop tweeting you because we're in the same place and that's weird.
@FakeWang your attitude?
@FakeWang such attitude, much sass.
If I plug my phone charger into this wall will @FakeWang yell at me or act like he doesn't see me <FACE WITH OK GESTURE>🏻
I really love live letlive but I also like not getting up :(
Do I go see letlive or do I stay in bed with Charlie?
I need more @katreenawhh's in my life. <BABY ANGEL>🏻<TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS>
Just gonna take a nap. Wake me when people want to be kind and not weird
I've been sent a lot of dumb shit in the last 24 hours what is wrong with people <SLEEPY FACE>
Rolled my eyes a little too hard just now.
@FakeWang you knew who I was don't gotta act like you didn't <SLEEPY FACE>
@FakeWang mhmmm <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>🏿
@FakeWang yooo you walked by me a million times looking like you didn't know me so I was like "aiight, I see how it is".
New wallpaper <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
The day I take a good picture with @Vassarrr  will be the day I get good at parking and Charlie learns to fly.
Being a female with tattoos is fucking annoying.
This is from a complete stranger and idk

@nightxwulf I'm downloading it off my wifi
I'm just trying to get some racially diverse emojis and it's been at 2 minutes for almost 3 hours. 
I need to get out more <UNAMUSED FACE>
Pretty sure @Vassarrr has been to more places in New Mexico than I have and I've lived here 18 years.
This guy on dr.phil getting lectured for watching "teen porn". Lol
Also realizing I'm becoming the extremely boring 20 something I always strived to be.
I finally bought accent rugs today and I'm very pleased with myself.
This picture makes me laugh out loud every time 
I stopped smoking and picked up a serious coffee problem
Dreams do come true 
Started to shower but the water got cold.
Now currently sitting in the shower with the water off waiting for it to get hot.
@HammerDev Id just settle for someone who was familiar with either of those bands
I haven't felt this shitty and anxious in a loooong time
@cherrychanti I thought so too lol
Norma drew me riding a dick lmao. 
Everyone at work arguing over where the chupacabras came from.
She was pretty grumpy I feel bad for all the poor Ohio people who's bestowing her grumpiness on now.
One time my brother and I showed up to see my grandma unannounced and she was super bugged so she picked up and moved back to Ohio.
@Kekoadougies @nightxwulf I was like "Ray pay attention to me" and he was like "hold on I'm looking at Pokemon memes" <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Same 
@nightxwulf always on your phone always napping <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Look what I found @nightxwulf <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
My life is a sad romantic comedy but without the romance or the comedy and just me and my dog eating yogurt.
This movie had one star. I didn't even bother to look. I could have saved myself 98 minutes
Charlie hates me 
Im done with this movie it got stupid.
This bitch is possessed and this dude is still trying to fuck her.
Should have got the anti glare on these glasses.
@cherrychanti I got starbucks today <PENSIVE FACE> :(
Throwing my phone across the room because I thought I was gonna be slick and hit people up.
I just want to know why @horny_emojis is wearing a dress today and who's small puppy that is.
Id say "Easter selfie" but lets be honest I was going to take pictures regardless. 
@FakeWang I love her
@cherrychanti I was too excited about earning back rewards on credit cards :(
It's 4am and I just got approved for another credit card. <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
It's 4am and I just applied for another credit card.
@FakeWang YOU DONT KNOW WHERE I LIVE how are you sleeping on my couch and throwing me pizzas?!
@FakeWang maybe
@FakeWang this is what happens when you start a relationship on tinder
@FakeWang that's the kind of shit that got you on the couch in the first place
@FakeWang I TOLD YOU TO SLEEP ON YOUR COUCH
I'm just going to sleep on the couch
I did 3 loads of laundry and I still need to do like 6 more <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm deep into cleaning out my closet that I'm at the point where I'm sitting in a mess of clothes and I just want to go to bed.
@FakeWang damn now I want to see her <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
@FakeWang like 10/10? Or like average 6/10?
@FakeWang maybe! I don't know how hot a hot stripper is though!

@jordynmarquez I've never kept him away from people though :( he's just moody and hates me <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I just have so many questions about conjoined twins <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS> 
@FakeWang it's okay. That's the kind of direct approach you need to take in order to nail a stripper.
@FakeWang those are clearly strippers/burlesque dancers.
@FakeWang I don't know how you got threesome out of that lol but I'll pass!
@FakeWang <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><OK HAND SIGN>
My dog has bad people skills. He used to be my little party buddy and now he shits himself when people come over.
That one Christmas I got a giant giraffe pillow pet. 
Here we all were bitching about living in Alamogordo and we had cool as heck White Sands in our backyard.
It's so weird that people who have never seen or been to White Sands think it's like this super amazing place.
My apartment is 75 degrees right now 
@FakeWang Samesies <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
@FakeWang Twitter thinks you're speaking Spanish 
@FakeWang at least he's getting laid tho
This girl has a large hairy birthmark on her face but she still managed to find a boyfriend 
When all your bills get pulled from your account at the same time and you're back to waiting for next Friday like 
:') 
It's funny cuz I also lost my virginity from  a 25 year old who lied about their age <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
I basically lost my virginity to Monica
So there's this episode of friends where Monica lies about her age and takes a high school seniors virginity.
The ghost inside and Letlive will be here next week. <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
But then she was like 
My mom is the cutest 
@nightxwulf he was literally 2 months old lol
@nightxwulf not even!
I love Chelsea Handler. She's raunchy and I love her.
@nightxwulf you can see charlie too! You met him once!
@nightxwulf I'm giving you a reason to come to Albuquerque! Come see my curtains!
@nightxwulf come visit me and I can tell you how much I like my curtains again!
@nightxwulf I'm pretty sure it was the same day I kept asking you to demonstrate scissoring with me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FakeWang YOUR COUCH
@FakeWang Nope! Now you're sleeping on the couch!
I'm pretty stoked about my collection of mirrors 
@FakeWang OH YES
@FakeWang now you're not invited to look at them because you judged me via Twitter.
@FakeWang when I was like 8 I wanted beaded curtains so bad. I should get some to please my 8 year old self
I found an empty jack bottle with a NFG sticky. I should clean my room more often. 
Can't get anymore tattoos until I do all the laundry I shoved in my closet.
@FakeWang yes. Yes I did. Everything is perfect.
I hung up curtains, where's @nightxwulf so I can tell him how much I love my curtains.
@katreenawhh I love you as much as the idea of me getting an area rug for my room (which is a lot) <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I've moved 4 times in the last 2 years. Not moving again unless someone marries me, I just got my apartment perfectly how I want it. <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Had this song stuck in my head all day. Also the 90s were a good time for music videos.  
@FakeWang last time I make plans with you. Not showing up for our Walmart hangs and shit
I'm at Walmart but where's @FakeWang?
Seriously I'm in love 
How I was doing anything before without glasses is beyond me. The world is so crisp and clear now <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
My neck is fancy as heck and also it's very hard to take a picture of your back by yourself. 
@FakeWang probably not :(
@whosrobertseed <HAMBURGER><HAMBURGER><HAMBURGER>
@FakeWang I might cry
My car died and now my stereo is broke on top of finding out the insurance people were just going to total it because it's not worth fixing.
I'm trying to learn the "butt play basics" 
Just kidding no one said it would be fun but holy shit.
Get the back of your neck tattooed for 2 hours they said. It'll be fun they said.
Walk in tattoo appointments are weird as hell.
@JBaaalls I got two pair for $125 lol. Still I woulda been down for $30
Glasses are fucking expensive <UNAMUSED FACE>
Getting my eyes checked and everyone here has hipster glasses. I wonder if it was a requirement to work here.
@FakeWang you're not alone. ED is a serious condition.
Don't you just hate when you're trying  to get it in but your erectile dysfunction gets in the way
A traumatized charlie because I took him to make friends with another dog. Didn't go well. 
Just took the best nap of 2015.
My beautiful tattoo for tomorrow <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
This is all from a female. I'm now positive I won't be dating women anytime soon as they are as weird as men. 
Bae 
@FakeWang Lemme tell you though I'm tired of 13 year olds bringing me this picture wanting to look like that. 
@FakeWang lmao <CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FakeWang 
Currently 
“@Time4Depression: You may not want to go to work tomorrow, but it's not like you have anything better to do with your life.”
One half of my fancy nape tattoo for Friday <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
What's the fun in working in a men's only salon I all the babes have girlfriends <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Joke was on them though because my immediate response was "Its April fools day" and they all broke into laughter. 
"We were hoping you'd do your makeup all pretty so you could cry and mess it up after you got fired"
They tried to fire me as soon as I got to work.
What if I went to work drunk? Like how April fools funny would that be like 2/10?
Don't be a dick today pls I'm fragile 
@katreenawhh I can't listens to TSSF without thinking of that comment <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Was deep into tweets about Parker Cannon looking for @katreenawhh's about eating cereal off his chest. <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
@ashgoooo_ lets get those dresses and be Twinsies <SKULL><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
@ashgoooo_ did you go that day des got her nose pierced? <NEW MOON WITH FACE><EYES>
And I'm getting my eyes fixed on Friday. Life is good!
Never been as happy as I am now and it's cool as hell because it's for no reason at all.
@FakeWang you got ripped off, Id def go back and demand the dick massage you paid for and didn't receive!
@FakeWang did she offer you a happy ending?
@FakeWang I'm sure genital piercings are way more awkward so ya know could have been worse!
@FakeWang Id feel more awkward than I did actually getting the piercings and that was awkward.
Is this a thing now? Cuz my nip piercings want to be seen too 
Whenever I see dudes with gnarly fingernails my first thought is "do you finger your girl with those?" <WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><OK HAND SIGN>
Lmao my car is totaled hahahahHAHAHA I might cry
“@WorldStarComedy: When all your hoes catch on to your games

I peaked at 18 <PENSIVE FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE> 
just took the saddest coldest shower ever
@FakeWang I personally hate Seinfeld so I would use no such line on you. <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><SPARKLING HEART>
@FakeWang omg do you get those too because that's 90% of all my messages
@FakeWang changing it to "Im an asshole but im a female with tattoos so you'll swipe right regardless"
I like people who don't get offended easily.
They should make a shower that's like a car wash and just does all the work for me and I can just stand there.
@I3ffeca In planning on going to bed in the next hour because I'm an old lady :(
I need to make some friends with cable.
Wanna watch the Justin Bieber roast but no cable <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@FakeWang I'll be there with my normal face and whatnot
@FakeWang the starbucks by whole foods on Wyoming is my spot. I'll be there all week offering to buy people coffee.
I've never felt more dedicated to Starbucks than I do right now. If I go twice a day I'll be gold in 3.5 days <NEW MOON WITH FACE> 
Charlie is 10 pounds of cuddly puppy and gas.
Im starting to think he's mainly composed of gas.
Accidentally made two utility payments last month so I have none this month <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
@FakeWang yo getting sucked into a another mean scary ghost realm in your own home is scary and I would hope hard to mess up!
I regret watching this movie.
@FakeWang the trailer didn't look bad! Granted they never use shitty scenes in the trailer.
Killer mermaid 1/10.
Only 1 because it didn't look like it was filmed with a potato.
For some reason there's always lots of nudity in these b horror films. I guess because the content generally sucks.
It got 1 star so it'll be my cup of tea for sure <OK HAND SIGN>
Currently watching 
@whosrobertseed lol spot on, looks just like you!
Hate movies filmed in the first person pov. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm so fucking near sighted how am I allowed to drive like this
@FakeWang holy shit you're stoked too right?!
Sooo stoked about this  
That song is 9 years old what the heck
Damnnn throwback jams 
His pet duck 
Left my Olive Garden leftovers at Olive Garden <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Literally so windy my eyelash blew off.

@katreenawhh this made me happy.

If I die it's because someone is ringing my doorbell and it's 1am and that's the time serial killers strike
One time I thought I knew where a Starbucks was but really just made @Vassarrr walk a whole bunch for nothing.
Bummed starbucks isn't 24 hours <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Not sure how safe my gated community is when there's an open door in the back that leads to the 7/11 <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
My real issue here is that dominos closed and I was supposed to wake up before that happened
"Just gonna take a quick nap"
That was 2 hours ago who let me be an adult
Horror movies on Netflix pls help i think I watched them all <GRIMACING FACE>
Currently 
Like cool beans but you're still a burnt out musician
I dated a pathological liar once. He claimed he knew a bunch of band members from bands I liked like it made him feel important or something
Some days I feel like telling everyone I'm going on lunch and just never coming back to work.
Incase you ever felt like you were going about your life wrong, at least you didn't make sad one direction fan art 
Should probably find out what time I work tomorrow
“@katreenawhh: ....Is this what being an adult feels like...? 
@Hammafer hey I love you, I was gonna text you the other day to tell you but I figured you got my telepathic message.
@jordynmarquez omg he's so short but I love him <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
The gas station was out of 42oz cups so I had to settle with 32oz.
Bummed cuz I thought I lived in America land of the over sized portions.
I want to stay but I also want to go to target <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Why did people paint their faces im confused.
These girls just mobbed the Parker cannon lookalike. He must be someone important
Yo this dude looks like Parker cannon <NEW MOON WITH FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
And stick to. So telling "one more song" to the opening band is probably never going to result in them playing another song
As far as I know these shows have times and specific times each band plays that I'm sure everyone involved would like to generally try
@TheGasworks gracias <TWO HEARTS>
This little girl needs to get her emo hair off me
This venue is playing some @jonnycraig4L jams while dance Gavin dance sets up <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Charlie has a shit ton of toys and bones but instead he brings a hanger to bed to chew on.
@FakeWang I don't think there's really much more you could ask for in life after spooning a small polar bear.
@FakeWang I'm glad you guys worked things out. 
Also she looks extra soft.
@FakeWang I'm feeling like you yelled at her and that's why she's not coming to bed. You should apologize <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
@FakeWang he's asking me to go to bed and getting impatient 
@FakeWang did you ask her nicely though?
@FakeWang dogs are pretty faithful <DOG FACE>

Today I did a million tapers.
All my favorite things I hated at one point, beer, coffee, being spanked, milk.
I'm really glad I got over that whole not wanting to text first thing and trying to act like I don't care to have the upper hand.
