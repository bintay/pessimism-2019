This is awful.
I can only hope that one day I can be half the woman she is.. Strong, caring, and beautiful. 
I love seeing everyone's pictures with their moms but they deserve so much more than just one day to say thank you for all they do. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Goooodnight. <SLEEPING FACE><KISS MARK>
I just want to disappear.
Gonna have a good night by myself. <OK HAND SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Dancin around my house, not having a care in the world. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
I don't think tonight could get any worse.
I hate this, I hate life right now. I'm just done with everything.
I don't feel good. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I've been laying in bed just listening to music for about 2 hours now.
High school is almost over and I'm so thankful for all of these people. <BLUE HEART> Last night was definitely one to remember. 
@megan_bryson I love you qt. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><TWO HEARTS>
Rainy days make me so tired. Just wanna cuddle up with you and watch movies.
Tonight was so so so much fun. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><BLUE HEART>
AGREED. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
So excited to see you. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Haha. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I'm done trying to help you if all you're going to do is reject me and not be appreciative.
@jantzeeboo Love and miss you girl, we need to hang out soon. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Happy Birthday cute girl. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><KISS MARK> @jantzeeboo 
When you post a picture thinking its so cute and then the more you look at it, the worse the picture gets. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Craving your kisses.
This is the worst feeling in the world.
Whyyy am I always hungry. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Just witnessed a car crash for the first time ever. Scariest thing of my life.
Excited to be in Cali in a couple of weeks. Definitely need this getaway. <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<AIRPLANE>️
I feel like crying and screaming all at once. <PERSEVERING FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Got my ass back to the gym today. <FLEXED BICEPS>
Going to Fitcon really made me want to be healthy and fit. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FLEXED BICEPS>
Disneyland, Costa Rica, and then summer. <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><BIKINI>
Today's already a horrible day.
I need a gym buddy or else I won't have the motivation to go. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I NEED to start eating healthy and working out more. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I was just starting to gain self confidence and then it all came crashing down.
When your mom asks if you want to go shopping &gt;&gt;&gt; Definitely need retail therapy <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
This sucks.
Haven't eaten in about 12 hours.. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Thankful for you.
@SavanahBrooke97 Love you too qt <FACE THROWING A KISS><TWO HEARTS>
@SavanahBrooke97 You're a babe. <FIRE><FACE THROWING A KISS>
This is the most stressful and nerve-wracking week of my life. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@SavanahBrooke97 Love you love you love you. <TWO HEARTS>
@sierra_marty Oh my goodness, you are so sweet. Thank you so much! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I need cuddles, sleep, and a massage.
Dance is killing me. I feel like I just got hit by a train. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@savannahsuv Your snaps are so entertaining. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE THROWING A KISS>
People are so shady and two faced nowadays.
I'm so tired. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
My body is completely drained, physically and emotionally.
@SavanahBrooke97 @marissahogan_3 I love you girls so much, I'm glad I at least got out of the house tonight. <WINKING FACE><TWO HEARTS>
This pushed me way past my breaking point.
It's gonna be a long night. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
A good morning text would've been nice.
I can only do so much for you until it gets to a point where I feel like giving up because you don't even notice.
So scared to grow up but so excited too.
Sick of feeling like this.
I just wish you wanted to spend as much time with me as I do with you.
@whitegirlkaila You're so sweet, thank you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<FACE THROWING A KISS>
To all the girls who have naturally perfect bodies, I envy you.
I need ice cream, a heating pad, and cuddles. <WEARY FACE>
Come cuddle me until I fall asleep. <SLEEPING FACE><TWO HEARTS>
Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling.
I need to get away. Clear my mind.
Don't EVER think you can get away with lying straight to my face.
I wish losing weight and getting a toned body was easier to do. But then I guess everyone would do it. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><FLEXED BICEPS>
Always being there for people gets kind of old when they aren't there for you. Sometimes it'd be nice to get the love I give back in return.
Tonight was so perfect. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Start everyday off with a smile. At least it's a good start..
Apologizing doesn't always mean you're wrong and the other person is right. It means that you value your relationship more than your ego.
So so happy I get to sleep in tomorrow. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I just wish you'd understand.
Trying to pick yourself back up from being torn down and broken more than once becomes so exhausting.
@amritadadwal_ Oh my goodness, you are such a doll. Thank you so much <TWO HEARTS> You're beautiful.

I'm glad I have a relationship where we can laugh, kiss, make fun of each other, play fight, and cuddle all within an hour. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><TWO HEARTS>
@brilynnbabe Yeess <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I just realized it today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Since when could you record a video on snapchat while having your music play?! So happy <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't care if it's for 5 minutes or an entire night, I just want to see you.
Today's gonna be a long day.
I have no idea what I'd do without these beautiful girls in my life. ❥ 
I've been laying here for about an hour now and still can't fall asleep. <WEARY FACE>
Craving your kisses.
@amritadadwal_ and @MariaMontes96 are the sweetest girls. <TWO HEARTS>
@DonaldRStults Scary. <FLUSHED FACE>
Why is the power at my house being so weird. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@TailyrRae @viciousvisions2 It definitely is. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Thank you so much, it means a lot coming from you!
Sweethearts was perfect to say the least. ♡ 
It's so nice outside. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️
Guys, here's a little word of advice.. If something that you've done upsets your girl, you should know to never do it again.
@sorayalovesyouu I love you <TWO HEARTS>
EW. So irritated.
I'm scared of the future only because I don't want to lose the people that I love.
Things are going to start changing and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet. <PENSIVE FACE>
If you have someone who loves you unconditionally, don't take them for granted.
All I want right now is cuddles and a massage. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I've been laying in bed all day.. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@sid_blairr Yes please! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@sid_blairr Love and miss you so so much!! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE THROWING A KISS>
Congrats to the Azurettes and @sid_blairr for taking region. You girls killed it. <SKULL><FIRE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@vaineapples Thank you, but I'd rather lay here in bed.
Everyone come cheer on the boys at the game tonight, dance co. is performing too and we'd all love the support. <BLUE HEART><BLUE HEART>
I just want to be a top priority and not someone who comes second or third to everything.
Tonight has been awful and I really don't want my night to end that way.
@AirSchmidt22 Thank you so much!! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>

@riaah_babyy I miss you and your cute face. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><TWO HEARTS>
I want to go on a cruise again.. But this time with you. Let's explore the world together <EARTH GLOBE AMERICAS>
Never chase love, affection, or attention. If it isn't given freely by another person, it isn't worth having.

I just want you to care, that's all..
I really need to stop eating so much food.
So bored. So irritated.
Missing you.
My mom always makes fun of my laugh. <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Beyond irritated. I need to get out of this house.
I never seem to do anything right.
Your mood has such a big effect on my mood.
I'm determined to better myself this year and to just be truly happy..
The Bachelor always has that one girl that drinks a little too much. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Kiss me.
I just wish you understood how much you really mean to me.
I mean, it'd be nice to have friends that actually talked to me and wanted to hang out. But oh well <INFORMATION DESK PERSON><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

oh wait, I have none lol
Didn't get ready today and I don't plan on it either. <OK HAND SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Just want cuddles right now. <WEARY FACE>
It's always nice having a day to yourself to do what you want and get things done.
@sorayalovesyouu Yes please. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Let me know when you can <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@sorayalovesyouu Hi. You're gorgeous and I miss you. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><TWO HEARTS>
Please don't tell me you're going to do something and then not do it.
 
Give more than receive.
Embrace the change that is bound to happen.
Take every adventure …
Laying in bed all night in tears isn't really how I wanted tonight to be.
Need something to do to get my mind off things. <PERSEVERING FACE>
“@Shayaaaa_963: In need of girl friends that are down to do whatever <TIRED FACE>” RT
It's sad how someone can literally snap me about three times and they will be one of my top best friends. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Need something fun to do for New Years so I can get all cute and dressed up. <SQUARED SOS>
Sick of asking people to hang out and getting screwed over or no response.<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I need a best friend.. Someone I can go shopping with, laugh about stupid things, and just talk about everything.. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I haven't even made a Gingerbread house yet. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@daulton7 @semper_fi98 I don't think you could've been anymore racist.

So if someone wanted to come give me a massage that'd be great. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

I'm so over not feeling like a priority.
Today was awful.

My body feels like it's falling apart because of dance. In desperate need of a massage this entire week/weekend. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
There's a million reasons why I should give you up, but the heart wants what it wants. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Don't ever expect me to just forget what you did to me and my relationship. I'm not a fake person so I'm not going to act like I like you <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>

Kisses on the forehead, saying "goodnight baby girl" as I'm falling asleep in your arms, little things like that are what I love.

I just wish I knew what to do, what would be best for me, what will happen in the future...

Screw love. Screw feelings. Screw liars.
The best option for me is to just disappear. Then I won't have to deal with this pain anymore.
I hope trusting you and loving you with everything I have wont leave me broken hearted again.
I'll just face the fact that I'll never be good enough.

@brilynnbabe It was the best feeling knowing I had someone to always go to, you were my other half and we were inseparable. <TWO HEARTS>
Been thinking about this beautiful girl a lot lately. I miss her more than anything. <BROKEN HEART><KISS MARK> @brilynnbabe 
Striving to be a stronger, more independent person. <OK HAND SIGN>

So I've decided I love @imagine_HB <OK HAND SIGN><FACE THROWING A KISS>
I shouldn't have to explain myself.. Of all people, I thought you'd be understanding and be there for me. Not the one to be mad at me?
I've never felt so disrespected.
I just want to escape from everything for awhile. Leave behind my messed up life. Have no worries.. With a smile on my face.
“@CoupleHacks: 
Well.. At least I got McDonald's breakfast. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I don't want things to be like this between us. <PERSEVERING FACE>
Just going to put a smile on my face and let it go. <OK HAND SIGN><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I can't live like this anymore.. I'm sick of crying myself to sleep, fighting all the time, and not being good enough.
Stop being such a hypocrite. You can't tell me you want this and then flip out on me. This is your fault, remember?
@Marze97_ I miss you too!
I haven't laughed that much in a long time. Such a fun night.. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Doesn't cuddling and watching a movie sound perfect right now?
Well... Looks like I'm going to bed <UNAMUSED FACE>
@kenziemorgan_ Yes please <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> text me when you're in Utah and we'll get together.
@kenziemorgan_ I miss your face&lt;3
Today's already awful..
Hopefully heading towards a happier, more stress free life.
Sorry for trying to help..

I just want to live my life without any worries. I want to have fun, no drama, no stress.
I just want to be happy. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@DuncombeAustin @_DJALIVE_ PC: me <OK HAND SIGN>
Don't even bother talking to me anymore. It's a waste of my time cause all that comes out of your mouth are lies.
Why do I do this to myself?
And I can't talk to anyone because no one will understand. They'll look at me completely different. I'm alone on this one.
I'm scared... so so scared.
@baibug_03 I love you so much, text me when you can&lt;3
I can be happy without you and I hope you regret everything you've done to me.
And I need some kisses.. cuddling sounds amazing too(;
Finally home.. (: I NEED sleep.
Well hey there naked cowboy (; 
"@yaylor_X: Once I'm gone you'll notice what you could have had." RT
You won't chase me. I won't chase you. I hope one day you realize what you had.
Never going home. I have nothing to look forward to there..
@CarsonRex Oh you're so welcome. Glad I could do that for ya.
@CarsonRex Positive.
@CarsonRex Hahah it's Kenna.. (:
@CarsonRex Awkward moment when that isn't Sav.
No more games. I'm not going to be a second option.
You don't have to pretend anymore. Save me the heartbreak and just tell me you don't want me. My hell. I can't do this.
I want someone who will show they actually care about me, who will be loyal, and who will want me and only me.
Such a different experience and I love it. 
Not letting you ruin my trip.
Trying my very hardest to hold all this in. I'm sick of crying. I'm sick of getting my heart broken.
I wanna be a priority to you.
Too excited for this week/weekend <PARTY POPPER><STATUE OF LIBERTY><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Come cuddle..
I'm not going to be the one waiting anymore. Sick of being ignored.
We both know where this ends.
It's nice having time to myself but it's getting kind of old. I need friends <FLUSHED FACE>

Spring break in New York <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Can't wait.
I'm lost in my own thoughts. My heart can't seem to ever forget you, which I don't want to but I honestly don't know what to do.
@bridirae Love you cute girl <TWO HEARTS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
Too excited for tonight. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<BLUE HEART> #BlueManGroup
Gotta love going through this and feeling like this during concert. Can't do it anymore. I just want to be happy.
No friends, no love, no anything.
Home alone and feeling like this &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I seriously can't do this anymore.
Something always brings me back to you. It never takes too long.
My life is a mess.
I'm not going to let this affect my night. Trying to stay positive <OK HAND SIGN>
@hay_bug99 You're very welcome cute girl. (: Thank you!
@hay_bug99 You're amazing.
Don't hang up on me.. it just makes things worse.
Enough with the dirty looks.
I don't want to be lied to anymore.
Soo I'll be in New York in 2 weeks.. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><STATUE OF LIBERTY>
Made me realize how much better she is than me. Congrats.
You'll never understand what you did to me.. But I'm not going to beat myself up over this anymore. I don't deserve it. <PERSEVERING FACE>
You're unbelievable. So done. <OK HAND SIGN>
@riaah_babyy hahah I love you <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><TWO HEARTS>
I'd rather die than go through this right now. Things just keep getting worse and they won't be getting better anytime soon.
I never seem to do anything right.
Why does this have to happen to me? I hate this more than anything.
McDonald's breakfast at 1 in the morning &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I'm stressed out to the max. There is so much going on right now.. I just need one day.. to relax, to catch up on sleep, and enjoy life. <OK HAND SIGN><PENSIVE FACE>
@cph_6 Awh thank you. (:
Ha.. Of course. Why is that what all guys want?!
I seriously just need to not care.
Soo if my parents could stop talking shit now I'd really appreciate it. I can't be here. I wanna run away. Sounds perfect.
I don't feel good at all. <PERSEVERING FACE>
I definitely missed that. <BROKEN HEART>
I shouldn't be home alone right now. I honestly don't trust myself.
I thought I was going to be strong about this, but I was clearly wrong.
I'm so sick of crying every day. Especially right now. I've never felt so hurt and alone.
Why am I being accused of being the bad guy here..? I didn't deserve any of that.

Don't lie to me. Don't go behind my back. And don't expect me to trust you when you do that.
@collinsnyder18 Thank you for always being there for me and helping me through this (:
@baibug_03 @madd_dog19 Love you bb <FACE THROWING A KISS> you looked hot <SMIRKING FACE>
My sweet sissy @madd_dog19 brought me Starbucks cause I was having a bad day <TWO HEARTS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ I love her more than anything.
I don't think things could get any worse. Why does this have to happen to me? <PERSEVERING FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
I feel so worthless.
I'm in the mood to cuddle.. Actually, I'm always in the mood to cuddle.
I have to fight the urge to text you.. I don't want to bother you..
#Wce #Throwback I love this sweet girl to death <FACE THROWING A KISS><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ @bridirae 
I miss you. But the sad thing is, you don't miss me.. At least it doesn't seem like it.
So I guess I'll have to get used to not getting a goodnight call or text from you for awhile...
Talk dirty to me. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><WHITE SMILING FACE>️
This isn't goodbye, it's see you soon <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.
That seriously made my heart drop to my stomach. I feel sick now..

Is that too much to ask for? I don't want to sound selfish, but I'd like to be shown off, at least a little.. Unless I'm not worth it.
@kenziemorgan_ I love you so much Kenz. Thank you &lt;3
@amritadadwal_ You're so sweet, thank you. It really means a lot
Your girlfriend should never feel like she's competing with another girl. Which is exactly how I feel right now.
I'll just cry myself to sleep. No worries.
Glad this is starting all over again. Ha..
I probably should've put at least a little bit of my time into studying for the ACT but... I didn't. <FLUSHED FACE> <PISTOL>

Not getting a goodnight call or text &lt;&lt;&lt; I'm not sure why, but it makes it harder for me to fall asleep.
I wanna go play in the rain...

@kenziemorgan_ Made me cry. I love you Kenz!! You're so beautiful inside and out. You better be expecting the biggest hug ever from me&lt;3
@kenziemorgan_ My sweet honey bee, I miss you so much &lt;/3 I can't wait to see you when you come back. I love you!!!
I really need to learn how to take my own advice.

Thought tonight would be fun, but no. What was I even thinking? Now I'm stuck at home crying. Just what I wanted!
Awesome. I get let down and bailed on again, like always..
Shut up and kiss me.
I just wanna have fun tonight, with you. Is that too much to ask for?
I just want to leave and never come back. Going on a drive <VICTORY HAND>️ Way too much on my mind.
Why does this have to happen to me.

@baibug_03 @madd_dog19 I love you girls more than anything&lt;3
I'm in the mood to cuddle.
I love but hate getting tickled.
Little things like that can really change a persons day and lift them up. You never know, being nice to someone may save their life.
@WJTruths Definitely made my day, thank you so much, whoever this is. (:
And my day is ruined.
I really don't want to sit here all day.
People mistake Valentine's Day for a day of just romance. It's a day of love and friendship, if you're lucky you'll have romance too. (;

I'd love if my parents actually listened to me for once.
I want to scream at the top of my lungs right now. Literally shaking.
Do you do this to me on purpose?!? You know how I'm going to react. <PENSIVE FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
You're fine with losing me. I'll make things easier for you.. You wouldn't have a care in the world if I was gone.
Unbelievable. Glad you care.. Balling my eyes out and you put more effort into ignoring me than talking to me.
All I want is to watch movies all day and cuddle. It's the perfect day for it <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I'm so sick of this. You don't understand and I doubt you ever will.

Why do girls take pictures of themselves with their bra hanging out..? At least have a little respect for yourself.
I'm happy, please don't take that away from me.

I need ice cream or something. I'm sure it will do a good job at making me feel better.
The more I think about it, the harder I cry.

And if you can't man up to do that, don't drag her along when she's hoping that maybe one day she will get that attention from you.
You have a girlfriend. Treat her right, show her off, and be proud to have her.
I give up. <PERSEVERING FACE>
Sick to my stomach thinking about everything. I shouldn't have to feel this way.
I hope @Jen_wat7 is feeling a little better.. Love you girl <TWO HEARTS>
People who actually care about you &gt;&gt;&gt; fake bitches.
I can't do this every night.. You'd think you would've learned by now how that makes me feel. But I guess not.
I'm used to this, which is the sad thing... Love being ignored.
All progress occurs because people dare to be ᎠᎥƒƒƎЯƎИ✞.
Why do you do this to me?

I make mistakes, some bigger than others, but I learn from them. So don't expect so much from me because I'm afraid you may be let down.
I'm just scared, that's all.
This is killing me. I really need to figure out how to not be so needy and annoying.
