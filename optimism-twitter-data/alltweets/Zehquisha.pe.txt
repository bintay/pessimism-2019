It was a really weird and terrifying dream.
He was working at the little coffee place downstairs when everything was happening.
I don't know who he is, but that guy, in my dream, with blue eyes is a saint.
It felt so real <CONFUSED FACE>
I just woke up and I've never been more terrified in my life. In my dream, this guy followed me to my apartment and chased me up the stairs.
He doesn't need someone like you in his life. Especially when things are as good as they are now, for him.
I hate you as much as everyone else because you've done nothing for him except bring him problems. You complicated his life.
I honestly feel so sorry for you, but that doesn't mean you can bring me into your mess. Doesn't mean I'll back you up.
Sorry everyone just wants to protect him from you. Sorry he knows how awful you are. Sorry he's tired of you.
Sorry you're a horrible girlfriend. Sorry your boyfriend is amazing. Sorry people see how terrible you are. Sorry everyone throws you hate.
Tired of the drama
Lol what I sent my dad since he couldn't be here <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I just don't understand how you expect other people to "move past it" when you, yourself, can't seem to do that.
You say "move past it" but how is that possible when every chance you get, you bring her up and rub it in everyone's face.
I'm so tired of the whole "we're just friends" thing bc there's obviously more to it than that.
I don't care if it was "just a joke" bc it was the first of April, I don't think it was funny and that's the shadiest thing I've ever seen.

That might've been three days ago, but Hahahaha that has me dying right now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm not the type of person to "listen to my heart"
I find it so pathetic how I push people away bc I don't like arguing and that's what usually happens anyways so I just try to avoid it <UNAMUSED FACE>
I hate that when I'm talking to someone I like, I freak out when I realize I'm looking in their eyes and so I look down <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>

I've never been in such a confusing and complicated situation with someone before. We take 2 steps forward and 100 steps back...

I like him so much that I just hate him for making me like him... Like, why tf did you have to be so cute and amazing <UNAMUSED FACE>
Its just I always fuck up and I just don't want to fuck up with him..
Lol @ the fact that I always say how much I want him in my life for like, a really long time, yet I haven't done anything to try to get him
Lol
Seriously though, how freaking cute is he!? Like, omg, I can't even begin to explain how amazing he is <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><WHITE SMILING FACE>️<RELIEVED FACE>

Lol But Whatevssss
All I wanted was respect, at least, and I couldn't even get that
Like, flicking me off, calling me a name and saying "f u" would've been a better thing to do than what you did....
It's crazy how much it hurts when someone you really like, does something or says something to disrespect you.
"Erica!?"
"Wow... Nope... Okay..... Yeaaah.... Whelp..... Yup..... So done.... Not today"
"Chill"
*repeats what I just said*
I try so hard to look like I don't care when he talks to other girls, but I feel like I suck at that and it makes it even more obvious <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CONFUSED FACE>
Kinda glad that I don't have his number bc I'd be texting him 24/7 and he'd probably start hating me
Technically we were never in a relationship, sooooo...
So in love with him <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><RELIEVED FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE>️

@CassieCeleste97 like, I'm not even kidding! It's so stupid and the fact that she's an idiot and she's getting punished too, makes no sense!
@CassieCeleste97 I'm so glad I'm not in there bc I would've been the 1st person to say something to her if she did something like that to me
@JonathanR_178 
@CassieCeleste97 yeah, that is such bs!! And it's so like her to do something so messed up and not man-up and say something!
@CassieCeleste97 oh that... Yeah... It was Victoria, right? Yeah, you guys should've told Bagnall about her bc it was her fault anyways

I hate being home alone
I never want to dream like that again... I swear, the last nightmare I had was back when I was like ten...
I almost freaking died ! Do you know how scary it is to dream that you've died or that you're about to, or while you're dying!?
I tried waking up, but I couldn't, then right when the little girl came back and I was laying in the hospital, I gasped loud then I woke up
I was literally so scared!
I just woke up from a nightmare and it's freezing in my room
I fucked up and I'm so sorry
So cold
Oh my freaking gosh.. Why would you walk in the door and then just stand there.. Like, oh my gosh!!!!
Night <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
I'm going to drown in my thoughts
I wish I could sleep forever
But I'll get over it and I'll be fine
I was so happy, and then I woke up and it sucked so much...
Spent 4 and a half hours dreaming about nothing, but him. I've never had a dream I wished was real and never ended, until now.

<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> from when I scared her <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
When I put a <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> emoji.. I literally am laughing so hard that I'm crying.... At least in my head I am
But I was laughing bc I'm an idiot
It hurt though.. I hit the ground so freaking hard!
...lol, I was laughing at myself for falling <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CONFUSED FACE>
..I slipped &amp; fell &amp; when I collected myself &amp; got back on the phone my friend was like "all I could hear was you saying 'ow' and laughing"
I remember one time I was on the phone at home and I started dancing bc it felt weird just sitting there or standing there talking and.....
I love Dierks Bentley's voice so much!
....but my car is totally fine, so it really doesn't matter
Pay the fuck attention when you drive
Way to go for almost hitting me
That's why you said that..... Well, you could've at least told me. Now I feel so dumb <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I just woke up and I feel terrible..... And I just realized I have two books to read and three essay due by tomorrow.. FML
I didn't think you'd still be up... But then again, it is barely a little after 1 in California
Sooo embarrassing
<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE>
"No, don't park there"
*5 minutes later*
"Just park wherever you want"

Like, really? Now the parking space I planned to get, is gone.
Well I just used up all my "hashtags" for today, so I'm leaving........ Ok peace <VICTORY HAND>️
OH! And hashtag I'm sorry that I'm a piece of trash that likes you bc you deserve better, obviously
Hashtag you're perfect for me but I'm not even close to perfect for you or anyone and I am sorry that I am trash but I can't fix that
Hashtag fml bc you are perfect
Hashtag I'll never be good enough for you so as long as you're happy that's as much as I can ever hope for
I can always tell if someone's my friend if I say "sir, this is a mugshot" and they finish my sentence...

How..
I don't understand why that's offensive..
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I just woke up and you're asking me to do all this manual labor and shit.. Please just shut the fuck up and leave me be
It was literally the funniest thing ever... It was one of those 'you-had-to-be-there' moments
And then it stops ringing and then I swear not even five seconds pass and it starts ringing again so I look over and I'm like "God dammit"
I'm sitting on the couch on my phone and the house phone keeps ringing so I'm like "Will someone answer that GOD DAMN FUCKING PHONEE!!"
Lol, at Brandy's...
Thank God I'm not 16 anymore...
He is so perfect <RELIEVED FACE>
K...
......but it was kind of funny, like the thought of that happening
Seriously... Laughing at a serious medical condition... Grow the fuck up
And sometimes when I get in..
I always say some shit like "oh fucking great" or "just fucking peachy" right before I get out of my car..
Man, I haven't talked to Jermaine in a lonnnnggg time!
I would've voted for him...
I am so freaking tired
Nervous...
I look like I woke up and decided to do five hundred pounds of cocaine, die, come back to life as a zombie and then do meth..
Oh freaking kill me
I hate hearing people giggle <UNAMUSED FACE>
I honestly hope no one saw that
I just almost fell...
Well that was stupid and there was nothing to get mad over so you just looked plain freaking stupid .
Haha, I'm dumb
I have literally done nothing, but smile the whole class period, and now my face hurts <WEARY FACE>
They crack me up...
I have a stupid and weird family <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
He looks so cute when he drives, lol
I don't think it's working bc I'm about to laugh
I'm trying so hard to hold in my laugh
I almost laughed out loud... Haha, whoops
Lol, I swear he's more awkward than me and I didn't even know that was possible <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
His stupid smile <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
How do you cheat on someone like that.. He's perfect...
So, after the cheating girlfriend one, I felt like crap and just couldn't bring myself to watch anymore.. I think that's weird, but oh well
Lmao, I love that dude!
"YEAH. NO SHIT. HONEY!" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
"THE WHAT!?" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Ahahahaha... He kills me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm one of those people that types really loud and fast and I annoy everyone and I'm so sorry
I feel like I have to vomit
I hate stairs
Nothing is worse than writers block <UNAMUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Well..... All of that drama this morning was interesting...
Now I'm just sitting here, laughing at myself and thinking how much of an idiot I am <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CONFUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I was trying to sound responsible.. Lol, but I don't think it worked bc he laughed at me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
So this guy from Texas State just called me and I made him laugh like 4 times.. And idk how I feel about that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><NEUTRAL FACE>
“@camerondallas: I want a big ass dog” same
So thankful
It may have only been like 5 dollars, but she got it for me with her own money, and that is amazing <PURPLE HEART>
What my sister got me because she knows I love basketball <RELIEVED FACE><BLUE HEART><BASKETBALL AND HOOP><OK HAND SIGN><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS> 
Had to post those again because they are so beyond true. Its unbelievable.

Lol, maaaaannnn... Some people are just so dumb <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hahahaha.. I just saw this vine where a guy touched a spider and it fell on him and then he screamed <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Fml <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I meant leaving, not leaning
I'm gonna have a red hand mark on the left side of my forehead by the time we end up leaning...
Well isn't that a stab in the heart... <UNAMUSED FACE>
Lol, Christian never disappoints <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
He's so cute... Ugh <UNAMUSED FACE>

Today felt like Friday <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Lol, poor me.
The freshmen are all like 6 feet tall, including the girls and they make me look like I'm the freshman and they're the seniors.. <UNAMUSED FACE>
But lol, no. I'm totally nice and funny, so don't judge me by my looks bc there's a whole other side to me <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I literally sound like a third grader when I talk and my appearance makes it seem like I would kill someone if they said hi to me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Why do the freshmen always look at me when I talk... I know I sound waaaayy different than what I look, but geez, you don't have to stare!
"The writer wrote it and we read it so it's going to help us" 

Oh my gosh, these freshmen have a long way to go <NEUTRAL FACE>

My shoes keep making farting noises..
Oh....
But ahhhh, good times...
I need to stop tweeting because I almost laughed out loud in class right now, sooo..
I think I had my backpack, but I'm not sure but I remember she grabbed me
And then I remember that time we went in the scary house thing and freaking Amanda fell and I almost fell
.......now that was funny!
"I was like ummm what? Because I turned around and you guys were gone and running" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Omg, I remember when we were talking to Isla and then all of a sudden bolted.. Hahaha and the next day at school she was like...
I can't even remember what we use to call him, but I remember we went ballistic when we saw him <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I remember what he was wearing but that's about it
Omg, I remember Blue and Gold night freshman year with that stupid guy.. I forgot his name though
We did so much stuff sophomore year that it's hard to recall anything. Like, the thoughts start to blend, but they're all funny
That was so stupid, but I'm surprised he never said anything to us... Like, I would've said something <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hahahahaha... Oh gosh...
I forgot how the rest goes, but I have a picture of it somewhere, it might be in my iPod... Hahaha oh gosh
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> "mala, mala, mala, Malagon" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> hahaha oh shit
Hahahaha!!! I just started thinking about sophomore year and that stupid "Malagon Remix" thing that me and Brianna were writing in physics <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But you've proven time and time before that you simply don't care, so........
That hurt more than you know..
Omg
Well......
I bit my lip and it hurts now...
I just got a paper cut like 2 minutes ago and it hurts
I have a headache sooo bad! <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
<UNAMUSED FACE>
Omg, I hate <DOUGHNUT><DOUGHNUT><DOUGHNUT> and the smell of them sooo much! It literally is making me nauseous!
I love having basically all of oomf's exs in my class.. I learn so much about her, from them..
My hands are frozen...
These little freshmen piss me off so much sometimes! <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
The sound in my left headphone just went out <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
......and that sucks......
When I see him, I'll admit, I still get butterflies, but I also feel the worst pain I've ever felt..
Not sure if parking there was a good idea...... <CONFUSED FACE>
He's always so sleepy <DOG FACE><SLEEPING SYMBOL><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
And that reminded me of that other fat guy... It might've been a girl, idk, but she fell out of the tree and she was like "ohh!!!" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I just saw this vine where a fat guy tried to hang on to a branch and it broke and he fell and he grabbed his arm and was like "owwww"
Lol <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Yes 

This class is literally so pointless. <UNAMUSED FACE>
.......but.........he has a girlfriend......
<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Well that was awkward

If he wanted one THAT bad, he could've asked me himself. Idc who you are, you speak to me directly and not through people.
Forgot I parked in the front <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
They were nice <RELIEVED FACE>
That lady was literally waiting soooo long for me to finish the last question.. Lol, I just didn't want to get up <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Idk how, but I did
Well, I passed
I didn't mean to laugh out loud, but I did <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Yesterday, when I went to the eye doctor thing, one of the worker guys fell down when he was pushing on some bar thing and it was hilarious.
I am a freaking southerner, 60 degree weather is freezing to me, k...
K, so like why the hell aren't they here!?
It feels weird to be at school, but not for classes.. Idk
Nerve wracking...
@CassieCeleste97 lol, I guess <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@CassieCeleste97 OMG! A DREAM COME TRUEEE!! <RELIEVED FACE> .... -sarcasm
@CassieCeleste97 lol
@CassieCeleste97 oh, well then that sucks, bc I'm gonna focus more on the time than on my test <UNAMUSED FACE>
@CassieCeleste97 ohh okay, so did it really take you like 4 hours to do?
@CassieCeleste97 so what was it like?
@CassieCeleste97 I just hope I don't fail it <CONFUSED FACE>
@CassieCeleste97 and I didn't want to ask bc he wasn't speaking to me, and I didn't quite understand if he meant on our own or w/ them
@CassieCeleste97 I ask bc Ben said "we'll help you sign up to take it again" to the girl that was in there yesterday, but he didn't explain
@CassieCeleste97 if we fail, we have to go like on our own time, like outside of school?
@CassieCeleste97 we have to take the class until we pass the tsi
@CassieCeleste97 I feel like I'm going to do bad, but oh well <UNAMUSED FACE>
@CassieCeleste97 and then they'd look at me like I was stupid, like noooo... I'm not, I'm just not confident sometimes when I test
@CassieCeleste97 right but I would've got 8/10 but I kept changing my answers!
@CassieCeleste97 that's how I am! Like yesterday when I went to school and I was in that class, they made me practice testing and I got 5/10
@CassieCeleste97 wow, well then idk. Were you uncomfortable in the room? Bc sometimes that it
@CassieCeleste97 lol... But really, I'm sorry. Was it THAT hard?
Hahahahaha Omg! Mr. John!!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Perhaps I would've done better if people weren't distracting me and I was in a better environment..
I freaking hate you. You're so annoying and you complicate everything and you're so frustrating and you confuse me!
Actually, just wow .
Oh wow .
It only took her a century to open the freaking door! <UNAMUSED FACE>
Holy crap it's cold! I have to stand here for like 3 more minutes! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE>
If you see my socks, you'd probably laugh...
One thing I learned from scary movies is... Never put on anything (ring, necklace, etc.) that you find in a box...
It's like I want to go to sleep, but this desk is so uncomfortable.. <UNAMUSED FACE>
Lol, I freaking love him <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I totally forgot all about that... Hahaha, I use to love that vine sooo much! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
"FUCK YA CHicken strips!" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Idk why that's funny, but to me it is.
Hahahaha! The girl in the movie said "insidious" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I got so scared
I literally thought my phone like had a melt down and just broke
Two Florida numbers just called me at the same time and my phone legit wouldn't work. It kept going back and forth between the calls.
We're watching scary movies on netflix <NEUTRAL FACE>
LMFAO! ID SOOO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm going to be so pissed if we're not going today! I could've stayed at home!
Oh My God!
My eyes are so watery and my face is frozen!
On the bright side... It gives me more time to listen to my amazing music!
Fuck Me. I have to walk all the way to the portables! <WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
