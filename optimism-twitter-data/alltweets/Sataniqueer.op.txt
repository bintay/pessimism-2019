Recent icon commissions &lt;333 
@NizzlesNiz Everyone deserves happiness. It comes in different forms but its always deserved. c: Don't ever put yourself down. &lt;3
@Sataniqueer these are my struggles, people.
I made a grammatical error today and it left a sour taste in my mouth.
@EPJimLavery It's something about their shitty faces that fucks me all the way up......
@Xenaero FUCK LOL
@NizzlesNiz /)///(\ Ugh, Niz you're so sweet to me all the time. &lt;3 I'm blessed to have such a fun, incredible guy in my life just as much.
So, on that note.
Stay optimistic with your work, stay optimistic with your life.
Be happy, and smile as much as you can. You deserve it. &lt;3
@Sataniqueer A little more stress to keep on track which imo is pretty healthy. You need something in life to keep you on your toes.
@Sataniqueer I felt like I had no time to do things. No time to play games with friends or do art projects. 
Set up a schedule? MUCH TIME DO
Can't stress enough how important it is to come up with a work schedule for yourself when doing commission work.
