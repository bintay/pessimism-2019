@evanvpham thank you.
@Lajeunesse88 @hrtbleed Thank you sincerely for reading, and for the lovely shout out.
@tomcorser not so much brave as terrified of dying without having made an impact or really loving deeply.
@dockane Hey, thanks for the kind words, and for reading.
@eugenephoto Twitter. (Have made some great connections here.) And, doing the things you love, online &amp; offline, you meet likeminded ppl.
@chollyer and, good luck!
@chollyer hey, thank you for reading. I'm so glad it helped.
@shitlords999 I can see 10 years into your future. Wait, no, I can't because I don't know you and I'm not inside your head.
@Kevin_Raposo Aww, thanks. :)
@TheJustinTo

@meliss_hughes No one needs to feel alone. We can find each other, now. This makes me incredibly, almost foolishly, optimistic and happy.
@meliss_hughes Over the past few days, I saw the power of social media for meaningful human connection. It's massive.
@meliss_hughes Books got me through growing up. Now we have these incredible platforms where we can all share what's meaningful to us.
@meliss_hughes Writing is the next best thing to talking. It's an acceptable way of letting others into our minds.
@meliss_hughes It's most of the reason I write. I feel like people don't *talk* to each other enough about the hard stuff. I get why.
@meliss_hughes I haven't been able to read all the comments yet, but the theme is: this helped. You can't know how that makes me feel.
Thank you to all who read / responded to my piece on Starting Over at 35. The response has been overwhelming. I'm struggling to find words.
@Car1ssa I'm really sorry to hear you went through that, but glad to have helped. Thank you for reading.
@Cody_McGraw or Hamburgler's burgeoning blob-like ego
@Cody_McGraw It looks like every guy on King West
@sladurantaye I will take it
@meliss_hughes it's a pity more men aren't aware of how their behaviour online - even if well-intentioned - can seem creepy.
@purpledocket :)
@purpledocket Sure you already know this, but you are genuinely funny. Thanks for making me laugh.
@alexismadrigal would be interesting to see study of same on Twitter v. World of Warcraft. Or maybe it'd make me cringe even harder.

@tinapittaway I'm waiting for Shitty Angus to come into this, just so you know.
@JoeJacobi @ArtisttoArtist thank you for reading.
@jujuculbert thank you sincerely for reading.

ps: don't settle! ;)
@eurydice13 8 months ago. Gotta watch out for those Canadians. ;)
@eurydice13 hey, thank you! Glad you made it out the other side.
@rsgnl you're really too kind. But thank you.
@sid_shenoy thank you for reading.
@navalang you're one of the good guys here. Have never felt uncomfortable talking to you. If anything I've been creepy.
@navalang never struck me that way. It's also maybe normal to want some validation, provided you're not demanding or projecting that need.
@analyticeye @LinkitzToys @kickstarter Same. This is awesome.
@Perliux gracias. :)
@officialcdf @observer Woah, neat. I'd try it, but I'm not definitely not well-known enough. Someday, maybe. :)

@damicocj thank you.
@navalang so basically my Friday night is planned. Perfect.
So my piece on starting over at 35 - 
@alexismadrigal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@fredbenenson thanks for the kind words. I'm glad to hear you came out the other side. It's tough!
@meliss_hughes Honest admission: I felt a bit silly announcing that. "I have a website." "I have a face." Well, now I have an internet face.
Good morning. I now have a website: 
@door503 thank you. :)
@smalera @qz I'll be in touch shortly. Thanks. :)
@Trucker_Mel @fsayre @tinapittaway oh god. You again.
@tinapittaway @fsayre Turd Adamson needs to meet my alter ego @Trucker_Mel
@tinapittaway @fsayre Haven't laughed this hard since I named an imaginary interloper "Fritz Dandelion."
@Err0r10 @karenkho hate to say it, but I prefer 'slightly chubby but nicely put together' middle-aged men. Sexual Stockholm Syndrome. :(
@fsayre @tinapittaway Turd Adamson. *Dying*
@karenkho or, compared to, say, men.
@tinapittaway I am all over this story about Shitty Angus. Please continue.
@HouseofAnansi @TheForce777 that is a beautiful pile of books. I will be buying one asap.
@TheJustinTo thanks so much. You too.
@andreweckford most gangster prof tweet ever
@communicable aww, man / kicks rock / turns bright red
@Kevin_Raposo thanks, homeboy. xoxo
@frivmo I'm so glad it helped. Best of luck with the life changes and here's to the future. :)
@frivmo thank you so much for the kind words.
@emilymkeeler you just totally intimidated half the applicants. :P
@communicable thanks, my friend. You're one of the people referenced who inspires me.
@xoxfbjunkiexox thank you for reading. :)
@eugenephoto Thank you for the lovely compliment, and for taking the time to read.
@AndrewHStewart Hey, thanks for reading. I'm not sure it was courageous, really, but I'm glad you liked it.
@meliss_hughes *unpaid for fiction / opinion writing. Well-paid elsewhere (and gratefully so).
Well, I feel like an actual writer today. An unpaid writer, but, nevertheless.
@navalang my feed is rammed with talent, and it's really hitting me today. It's a lovely thing to be run over by.
@AliOReilly1 hey, thank you for reading.
This quote from @TheForce777. Yes. "The bravest thing you can do is be sincere instead of cynical and sarcastic." 
@DonovanWoods Sudbury is great. Strangers will make eye contact, speak to you. If you like that sort of thing.
@jennrpeters Glad to hear I'm not alone. Thanks for reading.
@RusulAlrubail @Medium It was hard to write. I shared it because I think it's important to not settle; I hope it can help someone else.
"'You can't leave me', he said. Oh, but I could." On walking away and starting over at 35: 

Don't worry about the NSA. Google's mysterious Content OneBox probably knows more about you: 
@tommycm NOT ALL OF IT BUT THIS IS A GOOD ONE 
I'm in love with @Medium again.
It's good writing because it's honest. That is the only thing, folks. Write what you are and let the chips fall where they may.
Well, I've read @JowitaBydlowska's new story three times and now I'm reading everything else I can find by her. Major talent.
Was told I write about love/life/hard decisions w/out sentimentality. Best compliment in ages. Worry so much abt being sentimental windbag.
@swpax thanks for this. :)

@andreweckford he was and is a great dad.
Decaf coffee plus evening walk. Have turned into my parents.
@andreweckford I remember it clearly. I managed to make some sort of wet dough with a terrible consistency.
@andreweckford my first bread attempt is legendary in my family. I was 5 &amp; insisted I could do it while mom was away. Dad let me. Big mess.
@andreweckford oh, that looks amazing! I will be right over. Lol.
@frankiemacd We have the same birthday! Hope it was a good one. Cheers. :)
@nejsnave Such a great feeling. Kudos to you!
@purpledocket endless amusement from this one. Actually funnier the second time I read it (first time was just oh...oh dear...)
@ptypk thanks so much for reading, and for the kind words of encouragement.
Last summer, I walked away from everything. On starting over at 35, fear, and not settling:

@tinapittaway and there's this stupid ego-bruised guilt trip/ hissy fit...IRL you walk away. On Twitter you get a permapublicshaming
@kelkord it's possibly the same as how people will gather round to watch any fight...or look at an accident...
@robertwakulat On my reading list, now. Thanks!
@robertwakulat This was excellent, and helped clear my head. Thank you.
@shanedingman Should be interesting to see how many unfollows I get, or am I already on mute, mostly.
@meliss_hughes For the record, I don't do any drugs. Ever. (Truthfully). This is why.
@meliss_hughes I've approached this from the wrong angle. The question I should be asking is, "what is power" &amp; how is it actualized.
@meliss_hughes This is becoming a koan. Fuck.
@meliss_hughes Almost everyone wants to *think* of themselves as a decent person.
@meliss_hughes Maybe the most telling thing is that shitty people - the casually evil - always try &amp; justify their behaviour.
@meliss_hughes ...possible that deep human character issues are predominantly nurture. Neuroplasticity makes this largely reversible...
@meliss_hughes (at least, to me)
@meliss_hughes 4. If the momentum of goodness is more "natural" to the majority of us, it's only a question of why evil seems to always win.
@meliss_hughes 3. The conscience appears to be a universal, inexplicable concept that most acknowledge. There is no corollary evil hive mind
@meliss_hughes 2. Love drives us more fundamentally than hate. Our first act is love/need, to be fed/held. Later we need others to be sane.
@meliss_hughes 1. There is an argument for a *biological imperative* to human goodness.
@meliss_hughes Here's what I've come up with, in case anyone else likes to ponder these things on Saturday night...
I've spent the past hour trying to convince myself, through vigorous internet research, that good is in fact more powerful than evil.
Good is more powerful than evil. Evil might have all the money, but good has the heart.
Women are like cars, says #Mayweather. If you can afford 20, you should have 20. 
@meliss_hughes *cracks a beer* / notices dirty windows
*This.* And, in my (likely to be unpopular) opinion, anyone who watches the fight is complicit/ part of the problem. 
@meliss_hughes love how they just glide out of their tethers. Go free, little boat, go free. 
@meliss_hughes boats in midair, bellies exposed. Would make me v. nervous if was my boat. But as a voyeur I like it. 
@meliss_hughes And then they do it all again. 
@meliss_hughes some get a tow... 
@meliss_hughes  a gaggle of guys in hardhats jump on, unhook, and help push off. 
@meliss_hughes then it's lowered, gently, to the water. 
@meliss_hughes a big crane picks up the boat with a harness. 
Ok so I'm watching the boats go in down at National Yacht Club. It is very organized.
Carded at the lcbo. By a woman. 
No makeup = god
Inbox: 9,999. Emails with teeth: 1.
"You're a beautiful girl, that's why you rush."
No, I'm rushing because I'm on my way to the LCBO and I haven't had a coffee
Everyone is putting their boats in! Boats chugging and coasting everywhere!People busily bumbling around docks!
If only I'd walked to the gas station and purchased / binge ate those Cool Ranch Doritos as planned.
@karenkho @idontlikemunday rice cakes with peanut butter / crumbs all over me and in my couch-bed / and I don't care
@navalang all but maybe 10 ppl have me muted
@blm849 nah, I only dance with ... Gusto
@navalang never inane to read smart thoughts. As a bonus, you don't mumble to yourself and anger tweet and write weird short stories.
@karenkho Fuck. Sorry.
"You have a heart of gold," he said.
In the parking lot of the church, the needle still in his arm, he had looked her in the eyes and he said that he could see her.
He had driven her up the coast to Monterey for a wedding. The sun all over them. Golden as if it had poured straight from the heart of God.
the kind of person she could look it and it was like looking at the sun.
She had been with one good man, years ago, when she was still young. He was software developer, a brilliant man,
She has six words. Six words she did not whisper to herself, string together in her head and hold on to as life crashed into her.
And perhaps, now, she is looking for a fight. If she could stop beating herself up she could break a face, use her teeth, pull out hair.
You came to understand violence. Violence came to feel like you, invisible, part of your environment, like air.
Except you were never loved at all. From the first time you can recall, you were pushed, kicked, thrown down stairs.
It feels like you have disappeared. As if you have moved from a state of being beautiful and loved to being unbeautiful, unloved.
Have you ever felt like human garbage? Do you know what it means? You don’t know, she thinks. I’m going to tell you.
when they're holding on to reality with just the muscles in their face.
There’s the trace of a smile on her face, that smile that drunks or druggies get when they try to stay outside,
Sketched out a short story to remember the woman I mentioned. I often begin with the end.
@RusulAlrubail simplistic...but small, daily actions of individuals will save the world.
@RusulAlrubail I have that feeling now. It was terrible for me to ignore her and I can't fix it.
@RusulAlrubail that was good of you. I'm glad you did. :)
@RusulAlrubail it happens to the best of us. Life piles up. I think the way for me to help change the world is to be better, change myself.
@meliss_hughes the best I can do, now, is write a story about her. So that she isn't invisible anymore.
@meliss_hughes I should have stopped and said hey, I care about what happens to you. Is there some way I can help. I hope she's okay.
@meliss_hughes like, underwear and a tank top. In broad daylight. I pretended not to see her.
Thinking about this girl I saw on the street yesterday. She was obviously high and wearing an embarrassing lack of clothing.
@robertwakulat yep. That's part of why I've always backed down.
@navalang *need to be
@navalang thanks. As a single woman I am tough, but often avoid conflict. New to be better standing my ground. I just did, and I won. :)
@robertwakulat if every jerk got challenged and shouted down, I think there'd be a lot less harassment.
@robertwakulat for example, no one taught me how to deal w / street harassment &amp; what I learned - to shut up and take it - was maybe wrong.
@robertwakulat thanks. I'm totally fine. I'm thinking about how I can use the anger to good ends.
No more silently walking away. 
@meliss_hughes no harassment will go unchallenged. My silence has made me complicit.
@meliss_hughes I will fight for the right to be able to walk from the streetcar to my home at 1030pm. Or whatever time I damn well choose.
@meliss_hughes he backed off muttering, "crazy bitch" like a beaten dog. No more will I back down. If will not cower. I will fight.
@meliss_hughes he must have seen the look in my eyes - the look of a woman who's been harassed, assaulted. Repeatedly. Like we all have.
@meliss_hughes something in me snapped. I got up in his face and shouted, what the fuck? I was ready to drop my stuff and fight.
@meliss_hughes gross sexual tone, leering, in my face. Not sure if he is going to rape me or rob me or both.
@meliss_hughes dude comes out of nowhere, like from between two buildings. Heyyyyyy lovelllllllly, let me help you with all your...luggage
@meliss_hughes I'm walking, alone, empty street, with my violin and laptop bag.
Another night, another incident of street harassment.
@ptypk Super interesting, thank you!
@brundle_fly taken under advisement. :)
@brundle_fly bad idea, to combine those two.
@brundle_fly Me too. Might be the allergy pills tho.
@meliss_hughes Changes the PR landscape, too. Hugely. In possibly exciting, cool, awesome ways.
@meliss_hughes And I'm more and more reading smart takes from smart people Twitter brings into my world, rather than MSM.
It's true. I don't got to newspaper sites first thing anymore. I go to Twitter, and then click through from there.
@purpledocket I mentioned him *once* - not an @ mention, and he replied, like, immediately. Pro... skillz... for sure.
@IlanaBenAri @RootsofEmpathy @21Toys Two great organizations doing things that will hopefully change the world for the better. :)
Hey, @IlanaBenAri, has @21Toys done any work with @RootsofEmpathy? I'm perhaps pointing out the obvious, but seems like a natural fit!
#uberpuppies. Brilliant. Evil. Brilliant.
Can the Apple Watch save our notification sanity? This excellent piece by @navalang says yes (maybe) 
Great to meet @LucaMedina &amp; hear about @FiveFourteen_ - only foster agency for LGBTQ2 youth in ON. Hugely important. Give them a follow!
Mad shout out to the super awesome @Kevin_Raposo and @KnowTechie . I love working with you. :)
@ThisTechGirl @DaniellaMailing @SeptembreA wow. Amazing interview.
Baltimore to Toronto

@meliss_hughes it also puts problems in perspective. Big time.
Just found out a friend who was homeless has a place, a job, a phone. That makes today an awesome day.
@ettagirl beautiful
@meliss_hughes and, if you can't stop making excuses for yourself, you can never really let go and love. You become what you hate most.
New short story this aft. About how you live through trauma &amp; you don't go  mean, or become a victim, but maybe you give yourself a "pass."
@michaelprior06 @jcamerongray @TheFiddlehd congrats!
@sladurantaye I often worried about this when I was commuting on GO. Awful. My condolences to his family.
@vasta also: My personal feelings about arts &amp; culture getting a lot less love than pro sports...and being bullied by jocks factor in here.
@vasta A clearer way to phrase it would be: it's not something that would likely be a popular topic with many sports fans.
@vasta You're right, @vasta. It is reductive, and I didn't mean to be condescending.
@JodiEchakowitz @communicable Lots of conversation in my feed. But I unfollow people who are a one-way street.
@meliss_hughes Nobody wants to question whether pro sports is maybe our worst and dumbest and most damaging cultural pastime.
The ethics of mainstream team sports fandom &amp; feminism is simple and shitty: You can't cheer for misogyny and claim to respect women, too.
@vasta yes. Recent conversation with @TODreamsProject touched on this. We need to look at the ethics of being a fan.
@vasta Agree. It's much worse that way. Still can't help feeling that team sports shot through with woman-hating and we'd be better w/out it
@vasta it only being worth $ to see men play men &amp; women are relegated to sidelines is er, sexist? Sure I'm wrong; haven't had a coffee yet.
@vasta I also think there's an argument against boycotting  teams who allow batterers, rapists and misogynists...wait, that's all of sports.
@emilymkeeler kind of like those banks of phone booths you used to see in fancy hotels (dating myself).
@meliss_hughes did I mention it's a long, lonely road of self awareness, where you must look deeply at your own failures? Happy Wed.
Spacing launch party. #theskyto 
Such an honest &amp; beautifully written interview on masculinity, sex, vulnerability...definitely need to read this. 
BOATS 
@communicable some jerk is cooking bacon. Time for cake.
@communicable I love everything about this tweet. Especially "gloss" thrown in there.
@communicable I can attest to this. Boy can I ever.
@navalang hey now. Men aren't awful. A few rotten ones, and, okay, all that misogyny but otherwise I love them.
@navalang wait, spoke to soon. If you want to make me feel better just tell me I have the cheekbones of an Egyptian Goddess.
@navalang It's true. That's a very astute and sensitive observation. I actually have no smart ass reply. Thank you.
@navalang It's humiliating that I fell for such obvious bs, but also funny at the same time. Mostly because it is such blatant nonsense.
@robertwakulat aww. The miracle of Twitter friends. xoxo.
@robertwakulat as the self-appointed Queen of the #overshare, you know how I feel. But, 7:49m on a Monday.
@robertwakulat I have so many replies and none of them are appropriate for Twitter.
@mushi206 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@mushi206 :)
@mushi206 I'm not as embarrassed as I should be. Most of it holds up. I sorta kept my head on because I knew it was going down the tubes.
"Fuck the past." The best line I've ever written, maybe. But, well, fuck the past.
“Fuck the past.”
It's that time of day where I look at the novel I live tweeted when I was out of my mind in love, and hold my head in my hands and sigh.
@Hendersoname "dear deceased transit operators..."
@Hendersoname I read this wrongly, was horrified, then re-read and laughed.
@sladurantaye lol
This will be a fun night - can't wait to see the new issue! 
Docks are going in down at Stadium Road. 
@geoffmomin I was so deeply and foolishly in love when I wrote this. It's surprisingly clear headed, so I was in my right mind. Huh.
.@geoffmomin is making my tweeted novel, @hrtbleed, readable. I didn't ask him to do this. I'm grateful &amp; kinda emo. 
@meliss_hughes rather have wine and YSL and a winter home in Barbados, but who's counting.
Rather have beer. 
@Andoff duly followed.
@purpledocket !!!
@meliss_hughes my @OrchToronto colleagues playing at our fundraising gala last night. Aren't they fantastic?
Well, yes. 
@communicable eep
@swpax @hrtbleed not sure yet. This was a mock up @geoffmomin did for me on his new platform, jurnl.
@meliss_hughes many reasons. Glycemic index is just the first one. Well, fuck it. It's the weekend, there's coffee, and it's spring.
Birthday cake for breakfast? Why not.
#NightTwitter is good for stories. A neat ex. of how I use @twitter for work-in-progress, when I'm in 'ideas' stage:

"It was August. He hardened his eyes and he focused on not dying." For your weekend reading, intro to @hrtbleed:

@irishbarc this tweet made me laugh. :) the good news is that even without mermaid hair you're very pretty!
@shawnmicallef nice use of exeunt. Underused.
Well. I didn't choose this writing thing. Really I just wanted to be Leighton Meester's character in Gossip Girl. 
That to choose this path was to know what it is to be alone, in the way most men come to know it in the moments before death.
And he did not understand that in the heart of this choice there would be emptiness.
He could go either way, now. And he'd knelt by his bed those years ago and he'd made his choice and he'd asked for help -
"Do the right thing," he'd say.
Growing up, whenever he left home, his father, who was a useless man, a drunk, would lift his face. He would lift his face &amp; look up at him.
To change something within ourselves or to affect some change in others.
He knows in his humility, in this genuflection of thought, that there is no worthy goal in life other than change.
Who wants to buy a sailboat with me.
@Dr_Clawton not you!!!
I will pay you $100 to be quiet.
Must you shout?
Beautiful flowers from @GaryInToronto. I have such wonderful friends. 
I was dead set against wearables, then Apple made something beautiful and human. They know us. Resistance is futile.
App for Apple Watch: "Hello." Geo-based Tinder. See someone cute IRL, broadcasts you're single &amp; u can say hello. Or awkwardly sit &amp; stare.
@shanedingman impressed you've  already got a Watch version of your news app.
@navalang it certainly was, Nav.
@navalang your avatar is still an egg

@blm849 as one who is sitting here laughing hysterically over the word "troglodyte," I cannot judge you.
@blm849 I love this conversation about a dead Hungarian composer. I truly do.
@blm849 technology is marvelous.
@blm849 yes, yes he was. Granted, he could be 500lb faceless troglodyte and I would still want to make love to that mind
@blm849 Franz Transcendental Etudes Liszt. Damn. Nice find.
@blm849 oh god, it opens with a pic of FRANZ LISZT
@analyticeye none exists. Shall we make one?
@meliss_hughes or "an illustrated companion of unrealistic standards in mate selection" (dead, famous, brilliant, dead)
@communicable sigh
New Tumblr: Hot, dead gentlemen of the arts &amp; sciences.
@communicable woah girl. Well, mine at that age was a dead violinist (Jascha Heifetz).

It snowed as I walked. It snowed as I walked and I wept.
@geoffmomin That's a very generous offer. I doubt I'd want to paywall it but let's chat about the rest.
.@geoffmomin is excellent.  
@analyticeye thanks my friend.
.@analyticeye is truly special. Grateful to know her.
@spencergordon hide.
@shanedingman @navalang @purpledocket oh good. I kinda want to be his friend and that would spoil it. :)
@purpledocket @navalang *coughs*
I like this so I'm tweeting it again. Short fiction by me, Love in Binary. Because an algorithm cannot save me. 

@purpledocket @navalang oh good. I'm the least sarcastic.
@purpledocket @navalang no, it's that every single obviously charming man I've known turned out to be a shit.
@purpledocket @navalang *charming*, you say? Well, now I'm officially afraid of him.
@navalang oh pls
@communicable *when eating alone
@communicable I think it would. I do know I am most hopeless around dinner time.
@communicable mine would look like manic zag thru heart of darkness...might be useful to track for writing, tho.
@communicable no.
@navalang so there's still a chance we'll meet in IRL at some point. Excellent.
Carry on.
@thepuritan @pivotreadings @TheSteadyCafe @mattleerader ooh, the Steady! Great new venue. Congrats!
@communicable but they shi(f)t disturbing, that's the real q
@melkargi excellent suggestion. All's well here by the lake. Busy but good.
Up at 7, working by 7:30. #freelancelife
Help. I need a handbag that goes with this. @melkargi 
@idontlikemunday @vasta no no not until Friday! But we were doing a bday dinner.
@Nquisitiv @vasta it was. Even ran into @idontlikemunday which made it all the better. And bought tulips on the way home. Perfection.
@blm849 aww thanks. It's not until Friday but bday dinner with @vasta is becoming a tradition that's hard to beat.
@vasta you make me feel special, understood, cared for unconditionally. Thank you.
Well, @vasta made my birthday again. Lucky to have him in my life.
Food porn. Sorry. 
Look up, Toronto. Rainbow.
@vasta this is taking forever. Pls order me a mojito.
@vasta yes.
@vasta (sorry I am cab)
@vasta ooh is there dancing?

@DesignUXUI @mustefaJ @LaileeS @designco it actually blew my mind.
@meliss_hughes well that's that name for my next short story. Death by Electrocution.
unpublished novelist reads ms to robot husband in tub / death by electrocution
.@communicable lol thanks for the RT buddy. Just hook me up with an AI BF, already.
@snobiwan yes. Exactly. Yes.
@vasta ah well. We'll have fun tonight. See you soon. Xo
@vasta orchestra gala at Wychwood barns. Open bar, music, dancing.
@snobiwan I wonder about robots. A robot could probably handle me for an evening.
@vasta PLEASE. You are precisely the man I describe. I assume I have to book you well in advance.
Need a date for Saturday night. Handsome, charming, etc. Is there some legal, non-creepy service for this?
@dougestey I teared up, too. Thanks @DesmondCole for writing this. I hope something can be done to change this sad reality.
@navalang 

you

are

smart
@oconnorwrites woah. He looks smart.
I think I just ran into Brett Favre and he laughed at me
Success that's inauthentic - based on manipulation, exploitation, lies - is not success at all. It has no real depth of human connection.
Here is the topical tweet that will not tweet. Have tried redrafting in new tweet as well. 
@meliss_hughes issues management in the digital world? Ideal strategy would be better features &amp; proactive communications surrounding them.
@meliss_hughes 
@meliss_hughes I definitely cannot get a tweet with this keyword to post for last ten minutes. I really hope that's a coincidence.
Twitter won't let me post a tweet with the certain keyword in it, one that relates to the ability to message users
@blm849 my issue with Mute feature is that it doesn't work like blocking does; stuff still gets thru.
Weird.
.@twitter features I'd like: ability to control which followers can DM you, not telling users they're blocked. Ambiguity improves privacy.
/ Rushes to settings to check new DM feature / ensure I'm opted out
ABH. Always be hustling (about the things you want to change).
Writing on a cool topic for a client, brainstorming w/ super smart @mustefaJ @designco &amp; dinner w/ @vasta. What is not to love about today.
@blm849 Waiting for a Girl Like You. One of my characters listens to it over and over (ironically).
@travelinglens @altonbrown That is pretty darn cool. Congrats!
@MorganBaskinTO sorry that happened to you. Been there, know how gross it feels.
It occurs to me that this Foreigner song is about codependency.
It has turned into a lovely evening.
@meliss_hughes hope it's not just my imagination &amp; it keeps gaining momentum. Like a runaway train that smashes thru bullshit relativism
Is morality back in fashion in lit, tech, biz? No worries, it will be over soon enough &amp; we can go back to casual nihilism, cynicism &amp; irony
@brundle_fly I will fly over on my fewer-fucks-given-than-ever-before carpet, woven of the tapestry of summer &amp; promise of a better life
@swpax You really did. I'll need to read it a few more times when I can reflect. You're incredible, btw.
@brundle_fly this tweet made me howl with laughter.
@swpax Beautiful. Inspired by our conversation this morning, I take it. Except you refined all my thoughts so perfectly.
@meliss_hughes a new intro to @hrtbleed, set up by @geoffmomin on his new platform, 
"I allowed myself to be hardened by what had happened to me, when hope was the thing I needed most." New fiction:

If you don't know about @CharmaineOlivia, you should. Want to paper every wall with her gorgeous mind. 
The first time you get on Skype with someone, wear a disguise. (*Does not apply to business meetings)
@geoffmomin aww. you're so goddamn cute. Always such good energy. Good to virtually know you. Cheers.
@robertwakulat omg. *dying*
@robertwakulat I know nothing about movies, please stop making me Google things.
@robertwakulat sex scenes might be a touch uncomfortable, but it could be fun? Not sure I could masquerade as a lawyer, tho.
@meliss_hughes can't someone finish this for me? I will zap my brain into yours &amp; you can write &amp; cry &amp; I will masquerade in your office job
@meliss_hughes it's that whole, "having to deal with emotionally upsetting content / sitting for hours w/ no human contact" thing.
I always thought writers drank because...I don't know, it's just a thing they do. It allllllll makes sense, now.
@OMum22 nice work!
@TODreamsProject Thought you'd gotten 100. 40 is still amazing.
.@TODreamsProject leaves local history postcards in significant places around city. So cool. 

I tweet about @TODreamsProject a lot because he's a friend, but I'm wowed that he's created more than *100* different T.O. history postcards
@geoffmomin wow, this is great. Thank you. Great to see my words like that. I almost feel like an actual writer
@bruce_arthur I feel like all writers should be in charge of their own words, which is laughable Saturday night idealism.

 And the end of this story would be here.

Not. 

Give. 

Up.”

He answered without hesitation.
@bruce_arthur why oh why does the Star bleep out "fuck." It's only the best word, ever.
Park. 
Footnote: My dad really drove his motorcycle from Windsor to BC. He slept in a tent &amp; it rained until prairies. I don't make this stuff up.
@swpax is anyone claiming this? It's a man's world. I'd switch in a second.
The band that is playing at @hunterslanding is immensely talented. Thx for the Don Henley.
And, if you're reading this installment of @hrtbleed, an excellent companion is @LyleLovett 's cover of Flyin' Shoes 
The sun comes out. If you follow @hrtbleed, I've got some new stuff. It's sort of the beginning at the end, but it's new.
Downside to writing in public is sometimes you start to cry in public. Fortunately, most ppl are looking at sports. Thank god for sports.
Anyway, too many awesome people to mention everyone. Point is, I'm extraordinarily lucky to know all of you.
@robertwakulat @ivortossell hard to fit all to the good stuff in one tweet
@idontlikemunday also, thanks for being so supportive and awesome, as always. :)
@idontlikemunday :) I'm already feeling better by thinking about all the great ppl I have the privilege to know.
@meliss_hughes @ivortossell is smart, kind, humble, a talented writer &amp; reporter, and all around nice, gentle person I'm grateful to know.
@meliss_hughes the talented musician @flexrock has patiently stuck by me thru ups and downs since age 18. Basically the patience of a saint
@meliss_hughes Janice Walls, who is not on Twitter, is one of most thoughtful people I've ever met. She's also outrageous funny.
@meliss_hughes @cstvnsn has been an incredible mentor, personally and professionally. He is creative, kind, irreverent &amp; hilariously funny.
@meliss_hughes @communicable makes me feel more alive just being around her. She's smart and beautiful and wise. Everything brightens up.
@meliss_hughes @swpax is the best friend I've never met - a talented writer and educator - who offers moral support to a total stranger.
@meliss_hughes @TODreamsProject is really the best. A talented writer &amp; historian who is humble, caring and quietly hilarious.
@meliss_hughes .@vasta is amazing. He is thoughtful, considerate, creative and has isn't afraid to be vulnerable or show enthusiasm.
A rough morning so I'm going to selfishly tweet about people I think are great...
@shawnmicallef watched the trailer and loved it. Will donate.
@meliss_hughes forgot one: my father.
@meliss_hughes Mine: the Dalai Lama, Mandela, Alice Walker, Bronte, JC, Shostakovich, Tchaik, those who stood up to persecution, loneliness.
"Who are your heroes" is important to know about ourselves &amp; our friends. And  to measure our lives against those standards.
@RebsD @communicable do tell...
@vasta @anildash duly favourited!
Am turning into one of those ppl who favourite everything. Might be allergy medication. Everything shiny. Warp speed.
.@shawnmicallef: "I’ve spent 15 years...sneaking around...without once being questioned by police." 
If carding isn't racist and prevents crime, I really think the police should do it in all neighbourhoods, mine included. #neverbeencarded
How would you react to being carded just walking down your street? If it was happening in our orbit there would be outrage. #neverbeencarded
So, if carding isn't racist, how come I've #neverbeencarded? #TPSB #TOpoli
@idontlikemunday let's demand they card in our neighbourhoods, then, if all's equal why have I never been carded???
@GaryInToronto you snooze, you...just kidding. We'll hang.

WAKE UP TWITTER.
@chollyer already got one! Going with @habitualpixel !
Sigh.
@OrchToronto open bar, ppl
Who wants to go to @OrchToronto gala with me? My birthday weekend. I'll wear a fancy dress.
@OneChrisEdwards lol
@OneChrisEdwards I forgot Bartok.
@OneChrisEdwards oh gosh. Paganini? Wieniewski?Tchaik? Bach? Depends.
@OneChrisEdwards naw. I'm tweeting as I'm reading it for first time. Lots of rests. 4/4 which is a dream.
Mahler. 
@mattgallowaycbc it really is a fantastic piece! @TODreamsProject does great work documenting &amp; promoting our local history.
- and with his bruised and blistered hand, he wiped tears from his eyes.
And because there was no one to see him, he looked around the room - its wooden beams culled from railway ties, the broken backs of men -
His undershirt was stained and his fingernails caked with dirt.
He lumbered over to the counter and sounded out the words one more time, running his finger over the scar on his forehead.
"Fuck your question," he said, and hung up.
"It was terrible what you did," she said. 

"But if I say I'm sorry-"

"Are you?"

"I warned him-"

"You're not answering my question."
Because I have no proper vices anymore. 
Doers with ideals and passion like @IdilBurale who can also write are the new media non-elite. If the future looks like her, I'm in.
The scathingly smart @IdilBurale on carding: it is not intelligence-led. "It is arbitrary act of intimidation."


"I’m just the TV critic so I don’t know if it exists, this 'media elite'..."

/bangs head on desk


Good morning beautiful world.
@meliss_hughes we might act on them, years later, and wonder at our motivations. 

Ps - thx @geoffmomin for making my words look so pretty.
@meliss_hughes ...currents that get buried or obscured with time and practice.
The deepest desires of our hearts are like rivers cut in rock... 
Poetry on Periscope. So there IS a good use for it. 
@HouseofAnansi Yesssss.
@kinsellawarren @thetweetednovel You're too kind, Warren. And, no, it's not done (yet). I did hack out about 20k words out on Twitter, tho.
"What do...any of us do with all this time we’re buying? 'It’s more to dedicate more time to working.'”

Good writing days make me feel invincible, like I could go out and lift cars or swim across Lake Ontario. This is why I never touch drugs.
A new intro for @hrtbleed this morning. Nailed it. Finally. Massive relief.
Don't give up. 
@vasta precisely what I did.
If you've not had your heart utterly decimated, I recommend it. Average recovery time is six months but you'll feel like you've seen God.
@swpax "I put my hand over my heart and I asked myself..."
A big decision tonight. Wandering aimlessly, as if some act of god or nature will intervene, tell me what's right, what I already know.

 Because I can."
.@BlueJays fans: cool history of baseball in TO by @TODreamsProject Our team used to be called The Maple Leafs. Woah. 
Is that how baseball goes? If so I may quit now.
@trevor_cole I actually remember where I was, too. In car w/ my dad, on the DVP, listening to game on radio.
@trevor_cole 
Home opener. Know nothing about sports so asking fun questions such as, why does everyone get so excited when there is no real hope?
Another awesome piece by @TODreamsProject. It's almost like someone should hire him as a columnist. 
One seemingly small action can make a huge difference in a person's life, for better or worse. What we say and do matters. Massively.
@blambot I watch no tv. None. Zero. Downtime is spent on internet and reading. I was never really into it. Now I can't stand it.
@trevor_cole therapy helped me a lot in beginning to correct negative beliefs about myself / thought patterns.
@andreweckford I'm blushing. What a lovely compliment. Thank you.
@communicable so cool. Love it!
@trevor_cole wow. Good for you. Would be interested to hear how you did it. Maybe no "better" way of handling - unique for each person.
@AliceKaltman thanks! I sure hope so. What an awesome feeling!
If you suffer from anxiety, know this: it is possible to break through it. To the point that you do things you never thought you could.
Perhaps that's what life is. It's letting go. I only wish I'd realized it sooner.

/overshare
That was my last thought for the rest of that piece. I let go. There was no fear. There was no "me" - no idea of myself, if that makes sense
... It was a kind of high that's almost indescribable. Everything just worked and I thought, holy shit I'm playing this.
Going back to music and performing helped me immensely. It was completely terrifying at first, but this afternoon I had a moment on stage...
I stopped playing and over the years my anxiety worsened. It became difficult even to speak to people I didn't know.
I was doing a recital, it was something I knew well &amp; suddenly everything just went blank. I recovered in moment but the fear intensified.
As I got older, I started to get scared. Not just nervous. Like scared I would freeze up on stage. Then it happened.
When I was a kid I dreamed of becoming a concert violinist. I trained pretty damn hard from age 5-17.
Had a really 'wow' moment on stage today that I want to share.
@mushi206 I auditioned. :) it's not my job, though. More of a hobby.
@mushi206 it's awesome. Like being inside a wall of sound.
@mushi206 31 years.
@mushi206 :) 
@mushi206 ha! No, a concert I played in.
Intermission selfie with @GaryInToronto 
@vasta thx! Walking on stage now
T minus one hour to one of the hardest programs I've played. Gotta bring the focus.
Dress rehearsal for @OrchToronto concert today at 3pm is underway! 
Put love out into the world. Refuse to be hardened by the bad things that happen to you. Love your enemies. Forgive others and yourself.
@awg_allan was out dancing. A fun night.
@meliss_hughes overall, being single isn't so bad. Some guys are jerks but a lot of guys are helpful, nice when they have nothing to gain.
Almost forgot: thank you to man who insisted I take his cab when he saw I was alone on dark street at 3 am. "I'll get the next one," he said
T minus 1 day to @OrchToronto concert. Classical+Jorge Miguel flamenco ensemble. May also involve dance floor on stage. This is how we do.
@blambot I struggle with this as well. If someone's a jerk, I'm less inclined to want to read their stuff. Simplistic but true.
@GraceDefined thanks! Let's do that. :)
@GraceDefined I love this tweet.
Citizens of Twitter: it is not winter. It is not winter. This will continue for next 6 months. Braid flowers into your hair. Hug strangers.
@karenkho the first man I ever loved spent half an hour looking for my earring the first time we met.
@karenkho if it makes you feel any better, I'm prone to losing one earring when a handsome man is around because I nervously tug on one ear.
Haven't danced like that in ages. Forgot how much I love it. Thanks @DirtyDecibels @BenjaminCormier for a great party.
YESSSSSSSS 
BARE LEGS

@blm849 beer is an excellent post-run reviver, I find! Cheers and Happy Weekend. :)
@blm849 yeah. Don't push it too hard. That's really great you went today. Good for you!!!
@blm849 you might feel better if you do that every day. Working out helped me get through some tough times.
What does one wear to a rainforest- themed dance party? Leopard print? Camo? Hiking boots? An @ElizandJames dress that I hope still fits?
@smitty1966 sort of?
Maybe I *will* go dancing tonight. 

From the new Mantra EP by @flexrock ...


Whoever keeps calling from blocked number: State your case. Though if you want to kill me, I'm sadly unavailable tonight.
Beautiful fragrances, handmade by a poet. What's not to love? Thanks @LeNoirBleu! 
@thepuritan hey, thanks!
@robertwakulat part of it, yeah.
@blm849 we all do. I am trying to learn compassion for not only others but myself. Tougher than it sounds.
This thread. 
@meliss_hughes it is INCREDIBLY inconvenient, a last resort. Assume, as with much in life, there are elements at play we aren't privy to.
People keep asking me for my opinion about cancelled piano soloist. Here it is: Symphonies don't cancel soloists lightly.
@goddamnlyons I didn't need convincing but you convinced me. I wonder if @typebooks has it?
Next book purchase. Am way over book budget. There is no book budget. 
@Requiem102 well, damn. Now I have to read your book.
"Physics tells us that info is never lost...that what is seemingly destroyed is, in fact, retrievable."-@Requiem102 
Though they do not speak, she feels connected to him by the weather. As if he would wake, in this same storm, and know that he is loved.
@meliss_hughes too Pollyanna? Will counterbalance w/ this: I had to excise some real f'ing jerks from my life to see how much I'm loved.
@brundle_fly lol
Am surrounded by smart, lovely, supportive people who make me feel like I can do anything &amp; they'll catch me if I stumble. Life is good.
@blm849 I don't think you look horrible at all. And even if you did, you're so much more. You seem smart, caring and kind.

@thisispartisan that's my kind of editorial meeting.
@vasta thank you :)
@RusulAlrubail @swpax @vishifishy Awesome what you &amp; @swpax do, as well. This is edu in digital age. Advocacy v. top down.
@swpax @vishifishy @RusulAlrubail beautiful photos, Vishwa, and a great story about publishing your first piece!
@Margin_Notes @UA_magazine cc: @joannerider @YorkUPresOffice
@ptypk my condolences. *Hugs.*
Let's try this again. For the weekday/lunch crowd, my latest short story, Love in Binary: 

@meliss_hughes formatting, formatting. tsk.
Planning your weekend? You should really come see @OrchToronto play Capriccio Espagnol, 3 Cornered Hat &amp; Chabrier's Espana this Sun. @ 3pm!
Weeping/gnashing teeth that I will miss this. 
@Kevin_Raposo @KnowTechie Thanks, bud! Happy to be working with you again!
Good citizens of Twitter: I'm making a go of this freelancing thing! If you need comms help (writing / editing / PR), DM me.
@oconnorwrites oops, seems to be wrong link....
oh gosh. 
@dailynewshack He is. That's a killer lede.
@idontlikemunday when I read this I see how full of shit I am. Can learn so much from this book. 

Also, thank you for the nice compliment.
Sorry. Get pumped about books the way some do about sports. Will stop now.

/goes to bed talentless, bereft, outrageously happy
@meliss_hughes this has been out for FIVE months. I have been living under a rock, apparently.
I am ALL CAPS excited about this book 
@meliss_hughes finally. Finally.
@meliss_hughes I'm reading paras &amp; punching air, muttering things like "take that irony, literary Hipsterism. Take that......Franzen."
Atticus Lish.

That is all.
A troubled student dropping out made @swpax ask, should we burn down the system &amp; start over?

@communicable old. My inside self is old.
@dmrider Half the reporters on Twitter are funnier than either of those guys.
@purpledocket So, basically, wear sackcloth. A shapeless sackcloth and crocs. And carry no accessories except for your credit card.
@bigmouthdiva Commodification feminism. Or, more succinctly, bullshit.
@dmrider get it?
Can't believe I only just figured this out. 
A note from a friend in Barbados. What a beautiful place. Can't wait to get back. Writing &amp; swimming &amp; rum. Perfect.
No words. Just anger. 
@idontlikemunday I love when you tweet movies I've never seen. It's abstractly funny.
@HamzaK I was on 6,666
@jmcnally @vasta if ppl just started to say what they really thought, en masse, there'd be utter chaos, then things would maybe get better.
@jmcnally @vasta rant: self-censorship is actually dysfunctional, not oversharing. Thus, in golden age of social media, ppl still feel alone
@jmcnally @vasta a lot more people are likely having a shit day but wouldn't admit it, because we're supposed to pretend we're always happy.
@awg_allan nah, you're not, I'm just 'low mental filter'- one of my really charming features. Cheers. :)
This evening's #oversharing has been brought to you by Manuel de Falla, and five hours of violin practice in a cabin by a lake.
@awg_allan I just don't meet a lot of single, blazingly intelligent men who are also deeply kind. Rare. But I can't love a man, otherwise.
@awg_allan ...even if it means I'll ultimately be single. One thing I've learned: if you live your principles, you are never truly alone.
@awg_allan I have it much better than some, and I have agency. I can write about it, I can choose to stand up for what I believe in.
@jmcnally I know those days. You'll have better days. I know it. *Hugs.*
I just can't get with the new nihilism. I'll rail against it until I fucking die.

Havisham, out
At times, I feel naive, morally simplistic, that there's something wrong with me, but there's actually nothing wrong with me, at all.
And me, with my ridiculously earnest, 'I want to love one good man, a man I can deeply respect, and make him the happiest man in the world-'
But, in the bigger picture, I just look around and feel so hopeless sometimes. Like it's an uphill battle that will never level out.
I mean, there's a reason I'm not married.
I'm mixing issues, too. My own dismay at men who STILL don't take me seriously. Whose primary focus is still on how I look.
I have unpopular opinions. Oh well.
This is an incredibly unpopular opinion, but a lot of mainstream porn is deeply misogynist, hateful to women.
Is this shit normal? Yeah, yes it is. 

It's also fucked up, kids.
I see @vicecanada tweeting an advice column by James Deen, a porn star whose profile features this GIF 
As I woman, I feel ever-increasing level of dismay, despair. The misogyny just comes from all angles. It's completely normalized.
@vasta I'm sorry that happened. Hugs.
@GaryInToronto gluten-free, too
The person who breaks you down - if you can stand up again - has given you a gift.
Please stop, mom 
@RusulAlrubail I've seriously considered a drug habit to get through it. 

Joking. 

Sort of.
@RusulAlrubail Occupational hazard: having to sit alone with one's shortcomings, write them down, and share them.
@RusulAlrubail I disconnect, too. I'm circling because what I'm writing is uncomfortable. Being honest with yourself is rarely enjoyable.
The part of my writing day where I waste time on Twitter while growing increasingly nervous about what I haven't written, yet.
@vasta this.
@AlexCKaufman @HeatherMallick for some reason they've aged him about 20 years. Creepy.
Things I'm excited about this week: publishing new short story, playing concert as part of @OrchToronto &amp; my own little website gets born.
@joshuahind thank you for saying this.
I used to think social media kept us from closure. Blocking solved all that. I'm grateful for the ability to build walls when needed.
@karenkho you're kinda cute? Kinda???Deep six that negging fucker. Block into oblivion.
@karenkho this is a great story!
@meliss_hughes no being outdone by the United Church, never happens (heavy sarcasm)
Also, this priest is the bomb. 
That thing when you're at mass &amp; you're in same outfit you wore out to club. You realize you're an old lady at heart. An elegant old lady.
@HeatherMallick practice: here's a thing I wrote. It's good because it's honest. 
@HeatherMallick I'm not even sure it's fully a 'nurture' thing, tho I hope that's most of it &amp; I can evict the impulse with practice...
@HeatherMallick you're right. Just tweeting anything I've written makes me mildly uncomfortable, never mind saying why it's great.
@ryanwright hey, thanks.
@vasta aww, thank you.
@MrBearStumpy @chicagoexpatjy this is lovely.
"Her heart unfurls as if opening the fingers of a closed fist." 

ICYMI, my latest short story, Love In Binary: 
I feel like this wreath is not big enough and the Easter Bunny might miss our house. 
@tinapittaway Looks suspiciously like red wine...
@blm849 @RebZam Neat, eh? The guy who developed it, @dougestey , is super smart and talented.
@BariLeia So pretty!!!
Agree. If you drink, you need this! MT @RebZam Awesome - new app Hey Elsie lets you find products at specific LCBOs. 
When someone is cruel, manipulative, hurtful, it's rarely about you. Bullies are usually just trying to make themselves feel better.
@blm849 Thank you!
@jjgould @ivygould makes me want to have kids.
For your Saturday morning reading, a  sexy little story, Love in Binary, by me:


@communicable different for everyone... Also, xoxo
Love is slow. It's not a whirlwind. It's slow.
@wordsonpages Very cool. They look great!
@geoffmomin oops? Running while I type
Desolate. Nice and desolate. 
@JHammons I read it over dinner with a nice glass of wine (does that sound odd?) and it really made my night. Thank you. :)
@vasta @RavineVineyard Damn, son!
If you like someone's work, tell them. The little notes I've gotten, 'Hey, I love your writing,' mean so much to me. I can't say how much.
@CraigMacBride ha. Do you like watching Turner Classic Movies in your PJs?
Now dad has moved onto technology. "Name one person you know who can go for even one day without their phone. That's right. No one can."
@ryanwright "if he's not careful he'll be wearing stripes."
@meliss_hughes "It's always the shortest man who has the longest shoes."
"Saw an Australian Shepherd today. Man, what a beautiful dog. He made our dog look like a disgusting fool."#shitdadssay
Been home for ten minutes and my dad has already ripped on Justin Bieber and men who wear pointy shoes.
This terrifies me. 
@ggreenwald ridiculous. I'm not patient at all. Nor are all women any one thing. Sexist bs.
@JHammons @BathFlashAward @longstorylove beautiful.
Self confidence: if you don't have it, you end up projecting your insecurities and limiting yourself.
Fact: If you and I tweeted nothing but pics of cute animals we could have MANY more followers. Makes you think about your life choices.
An interesting @gdnlongread piece on loneliness in the age of social media:



Via @jmcnally
. @TODreamsProject is a such a kickass  storyteller. @TorontoStar should really give him a column.
@awg_allan alas, that was four months and many nachos ago.
@meliss_hughes Where does one buy a black tie mumu?
I'm playing a concert on April 12. You should come. Also I may or may not fit into this dress. 
@idontlikemunday exactly! The line about intonations of "bro" becoming its own kind of language, like Mandarin, was also priceless.
@idontlikemunday I laughed out loud at "whoo, smack that ass!"
Off to @Remenyi_Music to see if they can help with this. It's pretty far gone. 
@navalang &lt;blushing&gt; thank you. :)
"It spiked on Twitter for a few hrs, spawned a hashtag &amp;, like a whisper or a dream, was gone"

@meliss_hughes I'd be interested to know what @TorrensJonathan thinks of this Trevor Noah thing. J-Roc so not PC, yet never offensive.
Trailer Park Boys is great example of comedy that's politically incorrect but not misogynist, racist. Why? They make fun of themselves.
4. Sadly, his tweets reveal him to be a bro and a bully, hence rendering him perpetually unfunny to me.
3. Political correctness is a bullshit argument. We don't live in a vacuum where comedy is somehow immune to basic human decency.
2. They are offensive because they are mean. They are dismissive of ppl / groups he clearly sees as "beneath" him.
1. The questionable tweets are mean humour. Mean humour sucks.
This whole @trevornoah thing. Oh boy. Where do I start.
@TheJustinTo @LittleRedU me too. Glad you enjoyed it.
For your Wednesday morning reading, new short (!) fiction by me, in @LittleRedU. 
It's a little slip of a story. Short and sad is my jam.
Sneak peek (!) of new short fiction by me, "Love in Binary," forthcoming in @LittleRedU ... 
@TheJustinTo he should get together with koolaid jug that crashes thru my dreams w/ big question mark on him, spouting existential riddles
@TheJustinTo "enjoy your nightmares" is the title of my next story
@Rkulture @TashaTheAmazon this is my new jam &amp; inspiration, tx @dougestey for putting it in my scope
@meliss_hughes this better writer is male and he laughs at the title of my short story having improved it with only the use of pronouns
Nightmare: pages of writing eerily like mine but written by someone smarter &amp; cooler. This better writer(also better dressed) wins accolades
@communicable you made me smile. Thanks my friend. Xoxo
I think the lesson for today is that I always think what I'm writing is utter shit, when quite often it's not.
Also discovered 15,000 words of a novel I wrote ten years ago. I like it, now.
@Dr_Clawton already got drunk, slept, woke up. &lt;cracks knuckles&gt;
@idontlikemunday I'm getting there, yes!
@meliss_hughes made me feel as if I'd fallen in love and lost it all over again. Quite a little day.
@j_zimms @karenkho @catesish agree. Making fun of those you perceive as beneath you is lowest form of humour. It's also a form of bullying.
@meliss_hughes I've been reliving it as I type, I think. The specific emotions and people and events.
Well, I've typed out almost all of my Twitter novel in chronological order. It's been a strange day.
@SellersandNewel this is making me less enthused to visit your bookstore!
Putting my problems in chronological order @hrtbleed 
@robertwakulat my discontent cannot possibly be compressed into haiku format.
Now that we have control of our own little media empires, we're commodifying and sanitizing ourselves. That makes me want to punch things.
Perhaps "commodify" is a better word. Need to think further on why the soft porn-women-on-Instagram genre bothers me so much.
And, yes, it is possible to objectify yourself and, no, it's not feminism.
Ok for women to objectify themselves on Instagram but pic w period stain not ok. Pretty much sums up everything.


Alice Munro. Look at the eyes. 
@rightsprung aww. The loss of a pet is really hard on anyone, but especially kids.
@rightsprung oh no. I'm sorry. :(
@meliss_hughes some would call this oversharing. But it staved off loneliness, gave support to his mom &amp; reached others in meaningful way.
"Social media has become the first line of our utterly human response." NPR's Scott Simon on tweeting mom's death: 

Sitting in the orchestra is deeper, calmer, faster. You're in the heart of silence and a storm of sound. Everything goes away.
When I come out of the symphony I feel cleansed and joyful. A bit like coming out of prayer or meditation.
Classical music perhaps seems like an anachronism. It's a fundamental beauty, tho.
Two Sundays from today, the orchestra I'm in, @OrchToronto is playing a fun show. Spanish theme. You should come. 3pm, @TOcentre.
Saved a drunk girl from almost certain date rape. Him: who are you? Me: I'm her mom.
Listening to the man next to me condescendingly talk about his girlfriend's improvement in vocabulary. Want to slap him.
Comrades. 
@swpax you helped me get there. Thank you.
Hate and anger can only fuel you so far and for so long. Love your enemies.
Forgiveness is fascinating. It's like love. You can't push it or fake it. Maybe it is love, actually.
#Overshare This morning I forgave someone who hurt me very badly. It took months, but this morning, anger melted into empathy.
― Toni Morr…
@rightsprung oops! My stuffed animal replied to that!
@blm849 "unwrap" I mean
@blm849 or sloooooowwwwllllly open a cough drop
@blm849 it truly is and I truly am. With a wonderful, talented group of people, no less.
@blm849 not that kind of analytical nervous. Just, woah, that's a big hall. I guess when I'm on stage I don't notice.
@blm849 It made me nervous looking at it for some reason.
...also, I just found this photo of empty George Weston Recital Hall (where we play) and it's kinda freaking me out. 
Here's the correct link for upcoming @OrchToronto concert. 
Link that actually works: 
You should come see @OrchToronto April 12, Toronto Centre for Arts, 3pm. 
Another wild and crazy Friday night... 
@karenkho you look adorable!!!
@chollyer I'll probably regret it tomorrow, but thanks.
@MikeRiverso the key to our evolution or our ultimate downfall is in here, somewhere.
@MikeRiverso I dream about this stuff. Haunts me.
@MikeRiverso True. I just wonder if we can't do something even bigger with it. It feels like we're using the tiniest fraction of its power.
@MikeRiverso I think it can help the right people find each other. And maybe there are more of us than we thought.
Saddens me that we apply same social rules online that create problems IRL, rendering this tool useless to combat those issues. What a waste
Social media means no one has to feel alone. And it means power in numbers when ppl stand up for each other.
Remember how the entire world made a kid feel better on his birthday?
I'm left with this feeling we're doing it wrong. We have a potentially world-changing tool for collective empathy &amp; we're not harnessing it.
Yes, in person, it can be uncomfortable. But here? You control what you see in your feed. Social media was built for sharing &amp; oversharing.
I hate this feeling of there being this unspoken rule that we can't share what's meaningful. I mean, fuck that, really.
Twitter is about connecting w/ people &amp; ideas. The two go together. Content doesn't float in a context-less void. It comes from people.
My #oversharing is the opposite of being a good brand. That's ok, because people are not brands.
I think social media could stand to be more human. So occasionally I lower my mask and say something heartfelt.
To be clear, my #overshares aren't cries for help. I share personal things because I hope it will help others who might feel similar.
#overshare dear god, please make me less sensitive so i can coast through life in a comfortable fog of normalcy
A horrible winter, as winters go, but still good times w/ best people #TBT @sladurantaye @cstvnsn @TODreamsProject 
That moment where your phone randomly starts to play Ambitionz Az a Ridah during an important client meeting.
@communicable @401Richmond xoxo
@thepuritan @Sneilsonwwh @porcupinesquill so beautifully written. Made my day.
@Nquisitiv nothing you haven't heard before. Play them with your eyes closed.   Never look at the price.
@Nquisitiv thanks. I think it was made in France in 1920.
Hero. 
@jjgould and that's obvious, perhaps, but the phenomenon is rare enough that it's good to be reminded that it's not a fable.
@jjgould the most amazing thing about this piece is that it shows people can change.
@craiglcalhoun hey, thanks. :)
All I want for my birthday is this exquisite @CharmaineOlivia canvas. And to have the guts to be perfectly myself. 
@oconnorwrites beautifully written. Look forward to your stuff because there's never a trace of cynicism in it.
@LeNoirBleu I can't decide which one I want!
@andreweckford and the funny thing is, they sound almost modern to my ear. Minimal and also gorgeously intricate.
@andreweckford first part of Unaccompanied Sonatas and Partitas. He started composing them in 1703 and finished in 1720. A long gestation.
@meliss_hughes hey @andreweckford - I meant to @ mention you on this vid, since I know you like Bach.
The truth is often rather simple. It's our lies - our labyrinthine escape routes from the things we don't want to face - that are complex.
@whiskeypaper :) cheers.
@robhollywood  @whiskeypaper inspired me. Am now thinking of turning excerpts of my Twitter novel, @hrtbleed , into a chapbook.
@purpledocket I wonder why more columnist parody accounts don't exist. I suppose the real thing is laughable enough in most cases.
@jamiattenberg like why should you be anybody's "little sister." Reviewers wouldn't call a younger male writer anybody's "little brother."
@jamiattenberg it's a tad...condescending?
@iheartfailure @whiskeypaper @robhollywood second that! A little beauty. Pangs of envy.
Have reached point where Cher's Twitter profile actually makes a lot of sense and I wish to befriend her. 
Where are you.
@IdilBurale @DesmondCole @AGero and don't get me started on the sexism. Was sexually harassed in my first reporting job. Switched to PR.
@IdilBurale @DesmondCole @AGero HEAR HEAR! And, as I've ranted before, print media is pretty damn white, too.
@blm849 I buy myself flowers every week at the grocery store. If I wait for a man to buy them for me, well, lol, like that's gonna happen.
@blm849 I love how they open in the sun and close up a bit at night - like they are sleeping and waking up. Makes me feel happy.
@blm849 also: I have tulips, too. :) 
@blm849 it's a nice pic all around.
@blm849 you're way too hard on yourself. Many of the best people are.
@meandmybigmouth @AllieEsiri shows what I know
@Dr_Clawton thank you!
Progress on Bach G minor. Pardon the messy hair and no makeup. It's about the music (it is). 
@melkargi THANK YOU.
For all our talk about de-stigmatizing mental health issues, we live in an "I'm okay, you're okay" culture. It's hypocritical &amp; dangerous.
.@Russian_Starr 's piece on struggle w/ depression reminds us that major trauma can't shrugged off as "nothing." It surfaces eventually.
@tinapittaway and very nicely written by @itsmarkmedley .
@meliss_hughes it's all a head game,  an ego trick. Have none when you're writing. Disappear. But keep pushing forward, confidently.
I find things written months ago &amp; it's as if they've been written by someone smarter &amp; better. This comforts me. 
Heavy Sunday a.m. reading - a doctor's account of life w/ bipolar disorder. Useful in understanding mental illness.


@jmcnally I too am laughing at my own joke, presently. We thank us.
@jmcnally I'll let you know if Mick Jagger answers the door. Certainly sounds like utter dogshit enough to be him.
@jmcnally this is where my patience is tested. I will have a polite conversation with him about it tomorrow and see how it goes.
@jmcnally same three chords, wailing  and playing off key, accompanied by foot stomping.
Same Rolling Stones song for the past two hours. Really belting it out. He will eventually develop vocal nodes.
@vasta I literally lol'd.
Maybe there's more. Maybe social media is going to rehumanize us, in a way. The evolution of collective empathy.
As we've seen this week, social media can be a massive force for good. For starters, no one who is ostracized ever has to feel alone.
@vasta your honesty and your sensitivity make me feel more human and make twitter more human, too.
@LynnCinnamon beautiful.
We matter most to each other. Nothing else is nearly as important. 
@vasta don't leave, but I get it.
@vasta we're in the same place today. Feels like we often are. Miss you, xo
@awg_allan no, it's that I have a weird sense of humour.
@meliss_hughes it was cut to principal clarinet that pushed me over edge
Berlin Philharmonic's Capriccio Espagnol is So German. 
Not hating, just dying a little here.
@michaelwinter34 this tweet made my morning.
The thing with earplugs is you can then hear the beating of your own heart, which is also distracting
Tunnel guy and #odinbirthday - two things that made me feel better about humanity, today.
@jamiattenberg pics!
"Then there was the night I almost turned." @swpax on brutal realities of parenting and holding on to what matters:

@OmarMosleh I recall that from the other side of the interaction. A nail biting affair on both sides.
Remember in the days before text, nervously calling someone you're interested in? And you can hear their reaction to you in their voice?
#TBT basically my facial expression most of the time. 
@blm849 just seeing this now. I'm so sorry you're going through this. Sure you have many friends but if you ever need to DM, please do.
@sladurantaye @SFHPunks content not available. Boo sss
George Weston Recital Hall, by night. Sorta expect the classical music version of Today's Special any second... 
Sweet venue for orchestra practice tonight. 
Raspberry and kale might sound delicious, but I caution you against combining them in a protein shake. Take heed.
@melkargi was also sober
I realized after watching this practice video that I am also *talking to myself* as if some unseen critic is in the room...
@meliss_hughes @karenkho 
@karenkho I really couldn't do it. I recorded myself trying.
Today I discovered I cannot smile &amp; play a difficult passage of Bach at same time. 

Sort of like not being able to walk &amp; chew gum.
Existential question: how many times can the man upstairs tunelessly play one Rolling Stones song? 

The answer is eternity
My violin. Made in 1920. Smells amazing. 
@awg_allan Italian violins were, and continue to be, most sought after. Strad, Guarneri being most obvious examples.
#Overshare: after a rough night, a dream that one of my favourite authors was looking kindly into my eyes, telling me not to give up.
@shanedingman also: check out the guy in the corn field.
@shanedingman mine is targeted more toward men who look as if they are on an actual killing spree: 
Staring an "I Am on Tinder and I am Going To Murder You" Tumblr
@awg_allan Luzzati, 1920. Faux Italian, likely French.
@blm849 thank you! I need to smile more maybe. I have this bizarrely deadpan expression. Lol.
@meliss_hughes lol at typo - St. Party's day
In honour of St. Party's Day, here's some drinking, and some fiddling. 
Oh and here's the other half, where beer helps me play really fast: 
This track just blew my mind all over again. Echos by @flexrock :

@dougestey @BenjaminCormier really nicely done!
@snobiwan get on FB messenger with me. You'll see.
@tinapittaway the algorithm has no actual age. It's whatever you want it to be. 

Shudder.
I feel sorry for my friends at times. 
@tinapittaway I think I chatted with a Holden Caulfield algorithm tonight.
@meliss_hughes I mean it already had, but we are are now officially living in a bizarre not at all jokey cross between Idiocracy and 1984.
This Starbucks thing is really real. And capitalism just jumped the shark.
"Branded national conversation" is going to give me nightmares.
@juliacarriew "branded national conversation." Precisely that. And terrifying.
Online dating apps: deeply weird. Also: short story goldmines.
Toronto: Charge your devices. Now. RT @PowerStreamNews: Reports of lights flickering across the GTA may be indicative of a wider issue.
@rightsprung Okay. Let me sleep on it for one more evening. It's super personal (of course). Thanks in advance.
@rightsprung I can send it to you on email. I'm not sure I'm going to publish it online, though. Might want to submit this one somewhere.
No one looks at him, but she senses they all feel his presence. Who is that, they might ask. The more perceptive might ask another question.
@snobiwan Nice of you to say. Also, "Pfft."
@snobiwan Stop being smarter than I am.

No, keep going. Please.
@snobiwan you too can worry the ghosts of your favourite people coming back to haunt you over the awful things you've written ...
@andreweckford I'm going to sleep on it and maybe post it tomorrow. Need to think over some parts of it.
@snobiwan I'm going to sleep on it. And have nightmares.
Lat tweet was joke - am actually ALL scruples. All of me.
Also, if you are going to burn your Dolce &amp; Gabbana, I will gladly accept. Fat size six (Euro size 8). Hips. Little in the way of scruples.
Got nothing tonight, kids. 'Cept for a new short story. It might be the most depressing thing I've ever written. Also morbid and disgusting.
Yeah, "weirdo capable of typing in complete, interesting sentences" should be my bio for just about everything, from now on. cc @joshvisser
@vasta peak cuteness.
Some wise words in here. "Before I Go:  A Stanford neurosurgeon's parting wisdom about life and time" 
@jmcnally I met an amazing person, so, yes.
Me? I'm done. I don't care about the things I once wanted. We're all going to get old and die. What matters is to be kind. That is all.
After he left, this fellow I'd been chatting with said, "I didn't like that guy. He made me feel bad."
That's your fucking quote. That's what's abnormal, man.
I say, if you want a quote, ask any one of these people why they wouldn't stop and talk to this person.
He keeps pushing me to go on record and talk about poverty and homelessness.
... He says. "That's interesting to me."
"Because he's a person," I say. "Not one other person has stopped to talk to him."
...and flashes a fucking press pass and says he's from the CBC. "I'm interested in why you're talking to this guy," he says.
Just met the most lovely person on King St. We were having a really nice conversation - highlight of my night / and some guy comes up...
If you struggle to be honest, it's lonely but it's not in vain. You will connect. It will mean something to someone, somewhere.
@communicable it is, it is.
@communicable he's a fucking genius, of course. If I can ever write 1/10th as well as he does, I'll not consider my life an utter waste.
@ruqxx this rant was everything. Assalumu' A'laikum
"Like your radio without the beginnings or endings." This is why I tweet parts of what I write...
Ondaatje just made sense of everything. I marked this page. Years ago. Having no idea what it meant. 
In a cubby hole. Yessssssss 
@ptypk I'm going in. Even going to wear my unsolicited-comment-provoking hat.

damn the torpedoes
@ptypk I actually thought about making myself look deliberately grubby, but that would spoil the serenity of *my* evening.
@Nquisitiv bringing laptop. "Hey girl, what you writing?" "A piece about single women not being able to sit in peace in a bar."
Like if I was a man what WOULD I do. Made me dizzy. First thought was, go to bar &amp; drink by yourself like it ain't a thing. 

Just watch me
Many times I have wanted to sit by myself in a bar and just read a book. I don't because tends to go poorly. I have decided not to care.
Tonight I am going to do something radical. I am going to sit in a bar by myself and have a drink. Exactly like a man would.
...and reality, grey plodding reality, the hard grating crush of it, is the sane option, is what you should strive for or choose to avoid.
That she is simply overwrought, attached to dream, a narrative that once existed,
A reasonable solution – the preferred solution – might be to lie to yourself and pretend that your feelings do not exist.
How unfashionable and unwell, to go through life loving a man who has barely thought of you.
- if this was true how sad would it be? How sad and how inconvenient and how pathetically brutal.
And perhaps she had not stopped loving him, but only moved forward as one part of herself, and if this was true – she panicked –
...leaving some other, fundamental part of herself behind.
To understand her attractions and her deficits and move forward from them was to advance only as one part of herself,
This, she felt, was the end of her history – there was no next thing.
...and the notes scattered across her mind as a child’s scribble on a page.
And if she closed her eyes it was the same; as if the muscle memory had simply died, gone slack,
...a Bach unaccompanied or the Bruch Concerto.
She would practice walking on to the stage in the empty auditorium and start a few passages she knew,
After that she was like a pitcher who develops the yips.
The associate concertmaster leaned in, playing louder, and in the rests he glanced over at her face
As if she had settled into some new idea of herself. Her bow trembled on the string and she pushed forward.
She had scanned the row again and it was as if something in her had snapped, came loose and then ossified.
...his dream in plain sight and also his nightmares, the twist of his face as he brought down that hand -
His hand poised in the air and the expression on his face secret, his thoughts turned inside out,
Mouthing some words only he could understand.
She can remember the passage. The first movement of Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto. How Gould had played it in her favourite recording.
And she looked for him and he was not there and the pianist walked on stage and they exchanged a glance.
A sharp or A flat. 

Here we go again.  

Those years ago when she had almost lost her mind. I’ll be there, he’d said. In the front row.
His new suit that he would discard and his travel bag and his freshly-shorn beard.
The orchestra rises and she raises her bow to tune. She can pick Leo out, alone, in the front row of the mezzanine.
When she walks back onstage she realizes her hands are shaking.
...she was shouting at him, too, a thought anchored to a particular fading star.
and when she would come home drunk &amp; dance on their lawn in her bare feet &amp; shout silently at the night sky – where are you, where are you –
...but she never forgot him, out there, somewhere,
...and then the movie stopped as she stopped loving him and she loved other men,
...behind her in the mirror as she brushes her hair, together but separate, a movie set to silence,
Or moving through her life at times as if he is there, watching her watching him – hovering over her shoulder,
... changing her reaction, toying with the details or taking slow pleasure in their unfolding and his imagined reaction to them.
She had played this moment - or a version of it - in her head for years until it stopped mattering, or she told herself it did not,
It takes time, he said. Time to come back.
I didn’t see you, she said.  

I was upstairs.

Did you like it?
...and so for a moment she smiled and she kept on talking. He stood behind her and approached when the man turned and left.
And over the years she would do this, see him in her field of vision when he was not there,
It had been ten years since she had last seen him. She had been chatting with a man in the rotunda &amp; there he was in the corner of her eye.

What you do online is a reflection of who you are in real life, because this is real life.
@BoobsRadley I mean, isn't that the logic that causes people to act like total shits online? Which is maybe as bad as doing it IRL, really.
@BoobsRadley agree w/ not judging ppl solely on social media, but, isn't 'oh, that's my *Internet personality*' kinda a cop out?
Oh, but I am... "I am not my internet personality (and you probably aren't yours, either)" by @boobsradley:

Look up, Toronto. It's clear and you can see the stars.
@trevor_cole yes. Practicing right now! If extended session I use a mute. Just practicing to distract myself tonight, so nothing too heavy.
@jamiattenberg Holy shit. That really, really is. Respect.
@trevor_cole Thanks. Lake view and library quiet of this building soothes me somewhat. Not sure how I'd do in this city, otherwise.

@snobiwan @OmarMosleh 
@OmarMosleh that's my baby. Compact but functional. Have been lugging around since 90s. Had to get rid of travel case - stunk of lye.

When you stop sharing your most heartfelt feelings, life just becomes small talk. It's safe. It's also the opposite of really being alive.
...ppl say to me, I don't know how you tweet your fiction. It's so personal. But it feels natural, good to be open system / open source
@Closrto clarifies why I resist urge to self-brand. Social can be 4 real connection, deep sharing, make us feel less alone. Brilliant piece.
I overshare, have multiple identities, am terrible brand &amp; form real friendships here. @Closrto just explained why:

@robertwakulat the same way some artists come to hate their audiences: fear of becoming one of them, a nobody. Such irony.
When I love people, I'm just going to goddamn say it. Why not. Why not love the people you love and why not say it. Goodnight.
@communicable aww thanks, buddy. Anytime. Xo
@awg_allan appreciate the clarification and the positive sentiment. Cheers. :)
@shanedingman unfollowed. ;)
@geoffmomin @Slate should publications simply accept how desperate they are for clicks?

Love is a choice, and not always the easy one. Much respect to @swpax .


@LittleRedU @SummerFlingDJs I now regret my decision not to go.
Put love out into the world. Refuse to be hardened by the bad things that happen to you. Love your enemies. Forgive others and yourself.
Marcel Duchamp &amp; John Cage's musical chess match @RyersonU , by the brilliant @adamtbunch 
She would be like this: ethereal. Digital. Words. A photo. A band of data a wavelength scattering into 1s and 0s. A beautiful ghost.
...or the corporate drones watching youtube videos at their desks. She would not strive for nothing. But what would she be like, then?
...made her civilized, something in opposition of. She would not be like the bored housewives,
It's the sadness that gets behind her eyes and you can look in and see that she is not free, that in fact her wildness has tamed her,
And the worst part of it, what makes her seize up inside, is this: she looks like she is free.
This is the postmodern condition of her soul. A murder occurs every morning when she puts on her disguise.
The mad blur of all of it, the wildness that was in her that was always in her that is still in her now.
Manhattan by night, the drunken flights, that sodden and gorgeous Miami sunrise.
It’s all a decimation of beauty, the piling up of life: the parties, the men, the fumbling in taxis, the marks on her body she’d acquired,
“Goddess,” one man writes.  She had wanted the love of a good man. Well, fuck that, now.
Her avatar now is half her face reflected in the passenger-side mirror of a car. Cream-coloured leather. Flattering light.
The strength of the wounded is something beautiful to see.
...some purity her future self cannot possibly grasp.
and yet in that moment her beauty was, quite simply, more. Imperious and dignified. As if there is some fundamental knowledge,
But that graduation photo - looking at it makes her want to cry. She will never be more beautiful than she is now,
Finds her own body erotic in ways she hadn’t before.
and in many ways she is the person she said she would not become. And, fuck, she enjoys it. She enjoys how she looks, takes pleasure in it.
It is this earnesty she has tried to escape from. And she has, in a way: She’s on the other side, now,
History repeats itself. They had pushed her down, formed a circle around her. She'd felt the toe of a boot, the taste of blood in her mouth.
A few wry comments so it seems like a joke. Is it? Or is she bullying herself from the distance of the present?
There were three backdrops you could pick: she chose books. "Look at me," she writes. Painfully earnest.
In the photo, she holds a bouquet of plastic flowers, her hair in curls, the tip of her nose shining in the gymnasium’s reflected light.

@snobiwan now now
@meliss_hughes I feel weird about it.

@andreweckford Thanks. Maybe 1/3 of where I want it to be, but thank you.
Pic of me in a tight dress gets 18 favourites. Audio clip of me playing violin sonata gets 2.
@TheJustinTo You just started! Here is another teeny clip of the Presto (less sober, but easier movement): 
To go with other random classical music observations: Here is a recording of me, very sober, working on Bach.

@cgerben ooh, thanks!
@meliss_hughes I would bet money Ravel listened to this passage, and Rimsky-Korsakov's stuff, a lot. 
Ravel's Bolero must be influenced by Capriccio Espagnol. Either that or they are both in 3/4, sexy and highly repetitive.
Too cold 
...to join head to heart in this manner would set his whole life raining down on him. It would bring him to the ground.
If he sat with his own thoughts, which he purposefully avoids, he would understand that to somehow connect,
And so to find the moment does not matter – to pin it down, to hit at it like a child wearing a blindfold and striking at air.
The present is a place for the man who is satiated, too full of life, who can relax into what he has achieved. The past is for fools.
...and he had set out a pattern of momentum, which was to walk away, to move forward, until the past did not matter at all.
...how the edges of himself wore away or became more defined, so that he came in and out of focus like a mirage,
He remembered the hotels, the mirrors he’d looked in,
...the feel of stubble on his face when he kissed a woman he did not know and would leave the next morning, the bars that he drank in.
He can recall in knife-bright detail interviews he pursued, stories he wrote, the road trips, the stench of other men,
...and the things he has done since then are sharp and and command everything.
Was there a moment he had stopped loving her? It is as if the edges of those months and years are worn away,

@wayfaringreader thanks!
The heart of this world is good, and evil will not win.

Goodbye, New York. 
@starrshyne it's true.
@meliss_hughes damn you, New York (shakes fist)
I hate cities. This photo is incriminating. 
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of misogyny, it was the age of...misogyny
@tinapittaway The description evokes what I think of as "scent of debauchery." Highly underrated.
@meliss_hughes I can't even.
Misogynist Comment of the Week: problem w/ men who treat women like shit is the difficulty it causes for other men who want to date them.
@tinapittaway Well, now I need to own this.
Artisanal in NYC = perfection. 
@tinapittaway you've got it. Authenticity. You can't actually buy it, but they want you to try.
@tinapittaway They are selling them like that.
Rocking toward New York, snow flying in our wake. Ghost train.
Only starting to understand this passage from Beautiful Losers, though it's well-worn. 
Hug from my dry cleaner? I'll take it.
For example, I really have no idea who this is. 
@mustefaJ funny you should mention -that's what I'm doing now.
@mustefaJ when I'm done this draft I'll publish an excerpt. Thanks again. Hard to keep going at times when I feel like a fraud (most days).
@mustefaJ You have no idea what that means to me. Thank you so much.
Also...Jesper Dahlback remix of @ciaotiga 's You Gonna Want Me. Jesus.
It is true that a man such as this might go far in this world -- in the same way it is true that he might burn through everything.
And in holding himself to this hard place a man might destroy not only himself but those he might have loved.
- unless we take great pains to destroy the parts of ourselves that might move toward a truth we cannot see.
But the human heart is always changing, unless we ourselves cannot change -
It is a lie - they both knew it then, the kind of lie that is expected, that becomes a way of life.
...Her legs that she would hook around his neck. 

"You said you'd never settle. You swore."

"I didn't," she said.
She had loved him with her mouth, her hands, her small pale arms, her knees which could fit in his palms...
"It's funny," she said. "It's like I loved him with my whole person...my whole body." And she had.
@swpax I'm grateful to know you. Thanks for being there for me.
In other words it's criminal to ply someone w/ alcohol / drugs &amp; take advantage. But not criminal to emotionally coerce to same end. WTF.
Lying to a partner to get sex is a form of rape. Informed consent cannot be given.
Lying or cheating to get money = fraud and is criminal. Lying or cheating to get sex or love = "player."  Which is worse?
@swpax thank you. More than you know. Thank you.
“They’re like buses. There’ll be another one along soon enough.” He had hated him, and vowed to be nothing like him.
His father was tall and thin and he smiled down at him wanly. “Don’t ever worry over a woman,” he said.
And as a much younger man – a boy, really – he had watched his father whistle at women as they walked to church on a hot summer’s day.
...and still others that he pursued and achieved would cause him to become numb.
...that there would be dozens of women like her and many more unlike her, that some would wander in and out of his life like cats,
...a third person, a kind of spiritual being that was perfect and godlike and irreplaceable. He did not know any better at the time -
...but rather, about her, that she held some sort of magic over him: that if she kissed him and meant it they would be creating something –
He had wanted her so simply and so purely it terrified him. And he believed it was not about his own desire, his forward momentum as a man,
He understands now that what he thought was shame was simply weakness, a kind of confusion – a boy’s trepidation toward his own desire.
He had gently untangled the burrs from her hair. She had been crying and he had tasted her tears and he felt ashamed of his excitement.
A little bit of @hrtbleed work-in-progess coming up - so you might want to mute.
It might look like they're winning, but the bad guys always lose.
@IdilBurale @AndrayDomise @MuniraAbukar read this thread, twice. I found the tone toward @MuniraAbukar condescending and out of line.
@sladurantaye what the actual fuck. Also: 
Things happened here. 
This poem, by Josh Bell, has been rolling around in my head for days:

Twitter's like high school. Initially you were excited about it. Then you realized you are not cool, and neither is anyone else.
Taxis are the new confessionals.
@Dr_Clawton Hoof cocktail bar. Dundas and Bellwoods-ish.
@Dr_Clawton my friend had a Ward 11, which is just about the best thing, ever. I (foolishly) went for mulled wine. 
Oh, my. 
Feeling this rhum bar. Nice, warm vibe. Can almost pretend it isn't -10 outside. Caribbean vacation prep.

This is a question we should ask of everyone we meet. 

It is the only question.
@McCarmee It was a description of a character as looking "well-fucked." I was pleased with it.
Well, I wrote one good line today. 

It had the word "fuck" in it.
How you know it's cold in #Toronto: steam rising off Lake Ontario (water is warmer than air). 
@ptypk thanks, Peggy! Right back at you. :)
@chrismck042 Socks thing was flippant. But really, I can't even guess at the great sorrow of his life.
(Professor at OCAD. Remarried. Thinks of himself as a nice guy. Likes socks.)
He's got that soft, caring tone that self-appointed gurus always use. I've already written a story about him in my head.
Am listening to a guy lecturing a woman about finding her passion. Hmm. Maybe don't trust anyone who enjoys giving a lot of advice.
...and what feels like intimacy is only the sound of two men whispering to themselves in the dark.
It is true that friends who believe they are close can often be miles apart,
...their dress shoes sliding on the ice. Snow swirled around them. He placed a hand on his shoulder. "Like a brother," he said.
"Of course I trust you," he'd said. It was the last night before he left. They were both drunk, and they leaned against each other,
Sir John A. Macdonald, Drunk and in Flames, via talented writer &amp; local historian @TODreamsProject:

@Dr_Clawton I more meant, like, we go alone into the abyss. Happy Sunday.
Sophomoric outburst complete. Back to this draft. We all die alone, etc. etc. (but he WAS handsome)
@meliss_hughes he actually took his headphones to smile at me ...

/swoons
@meliss_hughes ahem. What I meant was, um, um...
Tiga lookalike in my building and he smiled at me WHAT WHAT
@meliss_hughes bottle your tears. Sell them downtown. To the west.
The Phone is subject. 
To turn away from the very parts of ourselves that would set us free.
@43n79w ... And, if I get that I involved, maybe there's no going back. That's what worries me. Once you look right at it.
@43n79w we all should. Instead of writing, which is likely useless, I should just go out and try to help people. But I'm a coward.
@43n79w I thought about that, too. Dogs are easier: they don't talk back. We don't feel shame at our own complicity.
To turn away from that part of ourselves that would kill what we are. What we love.
This is the struggle in all of us. To die now or to die later.
What you don't know, you don't know, you can't begin to understand.
What he doesn't know is this: a year ago, his daughter had climbed up onto the railing on the Bloor Viaduct. She had swayed and looked down.
There's a saying he's heard somewhere; it drops, uninvited, into his head. *You don't know what you don't know.*
"What you are about to see - that is still your sister. What has happened to her - how she looks now - it's as natural as being born."
In the morgue, the doctor had placed his hand gently on his shoulder. "There is nothing to be afraid of," he said.
If you see someone sleeping outside, help them get to warming centre at 55 john, if you are able. Those of us who can need to step up.
@meliss_hughes here's what it feels like to freeze to death. 
How does a man freeze to death at Yonge and Dundas? Did no one see him? Wearing only jeans and a tshirt? Jesus fucking Christ.
@teeceeTO beautiful.
.@idontlikemunday, you're amazing. MT I'll tweet @pmharper illustration of missing or murdered indigenous woman daily. To adjust his radar.
@meliss_hughes furthermore, enter through the front door rather than first going into the backyard! Shudder.
@KimberleeTaylor @karenkho same.
@amritachandra @communicable welcome to the new world order.
@communicable @amritachandra "10,000 hours is less important now than 10,000 contacts." Grits teeth.
Classism / racism / moral relativism / self righteousness / casual cruelty / abuse of power. These are my triggers, apparently.
@meliss_hughes Here's an idea: if you have privilege / power be responsible in how you use it. Have to stop now, is trigger for me.
@meliss_hughes Never mind the fact that it's shit reporting: completely unsubstantiated para where they flat out guess at his motivation...
@meliss_hughes This piece is just cruel. And people who are cruel can fuck off.
@meliss_hughes Who describes a failed suicide as something you "didn't get right?" If he'd killed himself that would have been success?
Hate this piece: casual ref. to suicide that he "couldn't get right" (WTF) and bury fact he was sexually abused.

I understand why you loved him.
I loved him, too.

We even loved his lies 

         Or loved those best of all.
@TODreamsProject 
@meliss_hughes irony. ugh. ten hail marys for me
beauty will save the world. 
@OmarMosleh thank you.
@OmarMosleh When I meet someone, I try to ask, "what do you *like* to do?" which shows interest in person rather than their "role."
We're a lot closer to disaster than we think. My piece on losers, luck and the need for compassion in a harsh world:

@meliss_hughes half an hour later. Goodbye ice. Creepiest sound when moving. Horror movie-esque. The blob, frozen. 
Ice. 
Random shoutout to @GaryInToronto, for being a wonderful and kind and beautiful person.
@WrightRyan Writing is rarely cathartic for me. When I'm honest with myself I often feel worse.
Dear Conscience: I hate you.
Still don't know what to do with this piece I wrote, which is intensely personal. It feels like too much. Which is maybe why it's good.
@juniorpilot1 yes, you fly a flag at half mast after you've confirmed casualties - not before.
I used to do crisis comms. I believed (and still believe) it's about basic human decency and common sense. Call me crazy (people did!)
Never mind the fact the logo change might look pretty ominous to those awaiting news of their loved ones. Who dreams up this shit? #AirAsia
Love how #AirAsia has its priorities straight during a crisis. *Gotta change logo from red to grey to protect our brand integrity.* WTF.
@43n79w @sesquiotic @IvaCheung T-shirt worthy.
@sesquiotic @IvaCheung well, James, would you rather have more followers or get to heaven? *THINK ABOUT IT.*
@idontlikemunday I feel like I am really missing out on something here.
@karenkho Join my 'I don't date anymore' club. We meet on Twitter on Saturday night.
"With one utterly thoughtless tweet, an unpublished 30-something writer besmirched her otherwise pristine feed, disappointing no one."
@OmarMosleh more along lines of, 'if I see one more Oilers tweet I'm going to hurl my laptop through this large picture window'
@idontlikemunday I was doing SO WELL.
With one utterly thoughtless tweet, I broke my rule about taking the high road and being gracious and ladylike. Ten Hail Marys for me.

@hrtbleed TOO SMALL
Well, @hrtbleed is going off the rails in the most delightful way. 
"Cowards can’t be set free. Not from themselves, not from anyone."

#ShitDadsDay
Totemism in white picket rural, 2014. 
In my 20s, I received the worst advice about writing: don't write about sex, death, or God. Too bad love and war are about all those things.
A book that cuts through all the shit and lets you see the lies you've told yourself is likely a masterpiece. And, yeah, this one is.
Finished Davis Adams Richards' Crimes Against My Brother last night. Broke down and cried several times, but the ending left me clear.
@JDhalperin I am. Merry Christmas to you, too.
I'll take drunk, lotto-ticket-checking, tearaway-pants-and-jersey friendly over silently seething black wool cashmere any day.
More strangers talked to me in Alcona this a.m. than in a month in Toronto. Several smelled of alcohol / wore tearaway pants, but still.
@andreweckford I certainly earned my supper.
Preferable to the other kind of chores, ones that involve people, and malls. 
Have started to ration out reading of Crimes Against My Brother. Am avoiding the end. As one will do with the things one loves.
Also: I think Gus Pike just jumped on this train.
A few people asked: is the snippet below from @hrtbleed. It is. Steady she goes.
Safe passage is about how fast you’re going and how absolutely fucking relentless you are.
Buried motion.

And she had been right: It was all about the future, then, as it is, now.
As if his excitement toward her – his intentions, good or bad - could be divined in this manner.
When they were still young, she would press her hand to his chest as he kissed her. She would listen for the quickening of his heart.
Is life, at a point, a flat line, a decrescendo into the melding of lives, or an incline into oblivion? We go alone into the sky.
There should have been something carnal there but there was no spike in his desire.
and he punched a hole in the wall and saw his own blood, they both did.
the shade of a wrinkle at the corner of her smile, his deadening desire for her, even that night when she struck out at him,
...and as he has evolved she is somehow getting to be less. And it’s the first curve of this decimation of vitality –
And he sees that he is getting to be more – more successful, more himself, somehow more aligned –
Perhaps even loved her for a moment, and yet it feels like a distant dream, as if he has rebuilt himself after each of these transgressions
We often make life more complicated than it is. The last affair had ended months ago, in the summer, and he had liked the girl,
He should go back, that’s what a good man would do, a weaker man, a man who is fearful of his own intentions.
He walks back out into the sunlight, slamming the door behind him, and he hears a sob.
@robertwakulat it's the having a path that counts, rather than an endless amoral geography of me-ism.
@robertwakulat just to really make myself a pariah, I fully believe in God, too, and am a big fan of the J man.
Back to the writing desk, sunshine, rainbows.
The fakest, nastiest people get ahead in this world, enabled by culture of greed. It will not change but I will rail against it until I die.
Maybe I should post swimsuit photos &amp; heartlessly make fun of earnest people &amp; things. Hear that gets you ahead on social media &amp; in life.
Unfollows over story about letter /1948 Browning book/ transatlantic voyage. Yeah, if you're utterly w/out a heart, best not to follow me.
The book was given to her my a "Miss Stark," who nobody liked, but she took a liking to my grandmother. 
Opened old Robert Browning book my grandmother gave me and a letter I'd never seen, and a pretty old bill, fell out. 
@trevor_cole because beautiful women look stupid in slouchy toques
Bring back veils.
Random throwback: Hats. Gin. Intensity. 
@trevor_cole it's why I want to do it, too.  It used to be so men would take me seriously. Well, fuck that, now.
@trevor_cole I can't say enough about it or what it has meant to me during this time.
He's up there with the greats and in 100 years this book should be a classic. I hope history agrees.
Halfway through David Adams Richards Crimes Against My Brother.

It is the best thing I have read.
@meliss_hughes I'd like to attach a note to say why. Such as, you're so beautiful I can't bear to look.
Don't like this thing where Twitter tells you you're blocked. Sounds hostile. It isn't, always. Sometimes it's a retreat.
There are men whose lives consist of nothing but acquisition and destruction. None of that changes the…

A murder is about to occur. A murder of pastries. 
Precisely the words I needed, tonight. That's why I wanted to write. To help. To be that thin strand of thought between hope and despair.
Take heart and know that no betrayal is so self-infatuated, self-serving or brutal it cannot, in the end, be overcome 
@Ripplecreatives @adamtbunch @lishylue @qmcarmela absolutely.
@adamtbunch @meliss_hughes @lishylue @qmcarmela h…
@Ripplecreatives @adamtbunch @lishylue @qmcarmela we all look a little...possessed.
Looks realistic. 
@idontlikemunday if I have bad dreams I will hold you personally accountable.
I was half kidding about that short story idea. Half. Considerably less than half. Okay, not at all. Goodnight.
@idontlikemunday I have not. Just downloaded it. Tucking into it before bed.
@tinapittaway thing is, he doesn't *do* anything, just loves her, sadly, from a distance. 

Also: that sounds awful.
Short story idea: a man falls in love with a woman's voice...on the radio.
@snobiwan the parts I'm keeping, yeah.
@meliss_hughes (and to think, I tweeted all of that. And then some)
Well, hello. 
@CraigMacBride I know the type. Do I.
@ivortossell I got the Bose sounddock. Only because I am suspicious of Bluetooth. If you aren't, wireless is totally the way to go.
@CraigMacBride I have to ask...I have to. What did you learn?
@vasta sending love and hugs.
Plath. Talentless hack. 
AND I use the passive voice. Whenever I like. So there.
@simonwilliam Frame that shit.
Do I take lines from real life? Damn straight I do.
"Why are you doing this," she had asked.

"Because I want to. Because I can."
This is the beautiful minimalism of the mind. Right when it is on the brink of exultation or collapse...
He felt her in a way he did not know was possible. As if he had entered her thoughts and she had entered his...
They were in her car. They had parked there, in the woods. He had looked down at her and she had been looking up at him...
@idontlikemunday I survive on cheese and olives. This looks much healthier.
In his dream, he laughs and takes her in his arms. "Fuck the past." 
@Dr_Clawton he was handsome and terrible. History repeats itself.
@Dr_Clawton such things stick in a child's mind.
@Dr_Clawton the first time I was kissed I put my mitten to my mouth, after. I thought "how sterotypical", smiled &amp; walked out into the snow.
Always hate my stuff, looking back after a shift in personality. Not this. It's like the change was written, in part, before it was felt.
Put @hrtbleed away for a month. Reread it now. dog's breakfast of a manuscript, but worth saving. Am pleased with its steady insanity.

*Another* Twitter essay. I'd like to say I'm sorry, but I'm not, really.
...from a generation that feels it has no history. And that is totally, totally sane.
Hipsterism IS a protest movement, however lame it seems. It's saying, I don't want 'fake.' I want what's real. It's an appeal to history...
Who are they supposed to emulate? Corporate drones? That's a sexy protest movement.
...I'm guilty of it, myself. But what's bad about young folk wanting to emulate artists and be outside mainstream???
Not that I think people need labels. Just that "hipster" is used as pejorative term for inauthenticity/poseurism/ pretentiousness...
@heretohinder violin-playing struggling writer with a romantic bent and a gluten allergy seeks wardrobe that makes her look less so.
Here's the deal: face your biggest fear (for me, having heart broken) &amp; it becomes easier to admit what you are, even if socially repulsive.
(If this ain't a hipster - a sharply-dressed hipster - I don't know what is.) 
@GaryInToronto same difference. Different era.
@adamtbunch couldn't have done it without you. Drinks on Ossington on me. In our hats.
Public confession: I am a hipster.

I like when someone alters my opinion. Like discovering a new little lane in one's mind, lined with houses where whole other truths happen.
(Thanks to @TODreamsProject for the insights on hipsters. I will steal all his ideas from now on).
Don't hate hipsters. The commodification of art and creativity and freedom is aggravating, but it's more hopeful than unadulterated greed.

Just because we've adapted to a condition doesn't mean it's ideal or healthy.
To be clear, I don't blame people so much as I blame the dehumanizing pace of cities and all the things that fuel material culture.
Compassion is as natural and necessary as air. It should be the rule, rather than exception. That it isn't suggests our culture is insane.
It's much easier to judge people's worth by what they have - job, achievements, possessions - rather than what they're willing to give.
A hearse is waiting outside with her father in it, and she comes back to help this guy out. How many people would do that?

Main takeaway from Rogers is Unconditional Positive Regard. Elegant in its simplicity. You accept people as they are, without judgment.
For Sunday reading, recommend Carl Rogers' "On Becoming a Person." If can you get past the psychobabble-y bits, is worth it.
Nothing external brings true happiness or peace. Not people, not things, not even your own achievements. Um. Happy Sunday.
Saturday night. Alas, this submission to The Paris Review won't write itself. Solitude is the beat of… 
@blm849 the perfect venue for a savvy stuffed animal to build his personal brand.
Instagram horrifies me. It's like an art-directed, tableaux high school.
@andreweckford I'm sure you *won't*, but it never hurts.
@andreweckford Good luck!
Before @hrtbleed, I wrote short stories. Revisiting this one, about infidelity, recklessness and self-delusion.

I don't know who you are, but you are insane, and I commend you. 
A great way to intro your kids to classical music: our annual Xmas concert 
@vasta @mehnazt love. Thank you.
I don't speak before noon. 
We can go on like this forever. You stay behind your square of light. I stay behind mine.
Peak lumbersexual.
Nothing says Merry Christmas like the overdressed, childless, 30-something couple arguing about "control issues" at an Xmas tree lighting.
I want to ask this Beck dispatcher why he's so miserable. Consistently. For years. I have wondered this.

@Scott_Gilmore interesting. I often enjoy  them.
@meliss_hughes (repetitive pattens with slight variation plus residual migraine)
I knew one day a piece of music would cause me to experience a break with reality. Turns out it's a Hockey Cantata. 
Of course, there are people who enjoy a fight. They're the same kind of people who enjoy any kind of attention - positive or negative.
Don't understand why people engage with trolls, ever. Like arguing with an invisible wall. Delusional and crazy-making.
@shanedingman @mirtle also good guidelines for dealing with occasional trolls. The block button is your friend.
@shawnmicallef love.
I'll be back, later, Glenn Gould piano. Keep a light on for me.
@swpax a wonderful evening.
The classical music happened earlier in the evening. 
@swpax we were rehearsing for a gig at Rou Thomson Hall, which we just played.
Glenn Gould piano. Will anyone find it strange if I...oh, nevermind. 
That was fun. A bit surreal, but fun. 
Partners in crime. Out of focus partners in crime. 
@OmarMosleh thanks! About to play now. :)
Deep in the bowels of Roy Thomson Hall... 
@sladurantaye thanks. Hope you're right.
Bit nervous before this performance. Something about Roy Thomson Hall, embedded deep in my psyche.
@Dr_Clawton You're awesome.

Shit dads text: "Do not go on your balcony. Some terrible wind is coming across the lake."
@pdmcleod I laughed out loud. Thanks for that.
@trevor_cole @OneChrisEdwards &lt;grabs coat and boots, sneaks away laughing&gt;
@jmcnally oh, it is.
@OneChrisEdwards @trevor_cole I think we are just playing background music for eating of delicious kosher food. Our job is to be appetizing.
@jmcnally I love it less and less. Moral courage is the new recklessness.
@jmcnally you gotta watch out for that, too. Being swept of one's feet usually means plummeting back down in short order.
@trevor_cole I liked you already, but like you even more after reading this comment.
@trevor_cole the event isn't in the concert hall itself but in the space surrounding it.
@TheJustinTo thanks. I'm not sure 10-year-old me would agree, but she was a tyrant.
But seriously. Our quartet from @OrchToronto is playing the Kosherlicious fundraiser tomorrow, 6pm. Throw some matzo at me if you're there.
@Dr_Clawton the times I have tried this it has gone poorly.
Tomorrow night I fulfill my childhood dream of playing violin at Roy Thomson Hall. If the lobby counts, that is.
@Dr_Clawton didn't help that I was carrying a music stand, which acted as a sail.
@communicable @OpenCCE @MakerFaireTO amazing! Congrats.
If you are a small person, be careful out there. Wind almost picked me right off my feet.
In the words of Oscar Wilde, "most people are other people." A few do it so well that they fool (almost) everyone.
The thing about missing someone is that sometimes it's physical. You have to just kind of hold your sides and ride it out until it fades.

Can't stop thinking about this quote from an interview earlier today:
@trevor_cole I'm going to use that the next time he tries to pull rank on me.
@trevor_cole yes, he plays violin, also, and we share a music stand. I sit on the left and do the page-turning.
@trevor_cole I'm just trying to keep up. My dad (stand partner) is kicking my ass. Appropriately it's gotten quite competitive.
@trevor_cole our timpani section is going crazy with the special effects - have a buzzer and everything.
@swpax you're quite right. And it can be pathological.
@trevor_cole yes, I am! It will be a fun program. A hockey cantata, even.
@swpax no, I think most people are basically good, but the temptation is to take the easiest route to please ourselves is always there.
@trevor_cole I often think the opposite. Gorgeous people get a lot of empty flattery and can easily become arrogant.
Really, the best thing you can be is kind. Looks, smarts...those are genetic. It takes real, sustained effort not to be a selfish dick.
My pal Brenna. Gorgeous, kind and talented. MT OrchToronto: Our violinist Brenna @whytesisters on a banner @TOcentre 
An editor once told me "everyone doesn't have a story worth reading." I disagree. I've always disagreed.
I suppose you could call it journalism, except I'm not writing about anyone "important" in the traditional sense.
Also, I'm starting a new, non-fiction writing project that I'm excited about. First interview today.
Cliche, but, man, I have the best friends. When I figure out what I did to deserve all of you I will make sure to continue doing that.
I am now calling Beck and asking for the existential special. They have me on hold.
The sound of traffic in the rain is sad in the vaguest, most ephemeral way.
@meliss_hughes nice guy, though.
I think my cab driver is high and / or has never driven before.
@andreweckford that's nice to hear, especially coming from you. Thanks.
@snobiwan I can only describe it as a "shit avalanche."
@Dr_Clawton just a phase of quietness / reflection. Quite okay in the broader sense.
@vasta Hope you have a nice chair I can convalesce in. Touch hungover. A touch.
@melkargi @vasta You better be at my Xmas party, @JAWalker. Or else.
@andreweckford I never intended to quit Twitter. Sometimes I just have nothing I want to say.
@andreweckford weird. He was like the mayor of a small city.
@andreweckford uh oh. What happened with Coyne?
It makes sense to try to not feel certain things. It's painful. It's inefficient. It also never works.
Otherwise, you run the risk of having them clobber you like a 10,000 lb shithammer, when you least expect it.
You, er, probably shouldn't tweet them, but you gotta feel them.
As for recent emo-ness, I offer this, in case it's of help to anyone: you gotta feel your feelings.
People have asked, am I still doing @hrtbleed. I'm still writing it, but not tweeting, as I had to make changes to the plot/characters.
@bruce_arthur I'm suspicious of anything finite.
@bruce_arthur this is why I am distrustful of numbers.
@bruce_arthur I left. Too crowded for this introvert. Another time, perhaps.
@bruce_arthur should've looked for doughy fools. My mistake. I was carrying a violin.
@robertwakulat me? Yeah. I have so much to be grateful for.
@robertwakulat awesome!
@bruce_arthur I looked for you, but there were a lot of smart-looking people.
Put love out into the world. Refuse to be hardened by the bad things that happen to you. Love your enemies. Forgive others and yourself.
I might bring my violin when I leave the house, anyway. It's a good way to get yourself into (or out of) trouble.
Missing out on Newsapalooza tonight. Had an invite to play violin, but, alas, this fiction writer did not meet the qualifications...
@blm849 @tinapittaway @kinsellawarren Hey, thanks.
Profound and beautiful piece by @cordjefferson on the struggle for kindness &amp; compassion in an unkind world.

@andreweckford he's pretty talented.
A new mix from @flexrock, with brand two new tracks and a personal fav, @ciaotiga's Trust your Body. 
@ShiftParadigm @AlexVKluge Absolutely. It's the only way to get closer to the book you want to write.
@trevor_cole That's oddly comforting. I have only roughly 80,000 words of failed novel to my name, plus one truly shitty novella.
Discarding &gt;20,000 words is really minuscule in the grand scheme of things.
False starts are part of the process of writing - don't consider it a waste of time. Just part of the whole deal.
@lectio Sort of, yes.
@emilymkeeler Good taste in poetry - no one should mind...
@shawnmicallef appalling misconceptions! Baseless accusations!

@idontlikemunday Hey, thanks. Maybe when I look at it tomorrow I'll like it better and can see where it needs patching.
@bruce_arthur Subtly erotic.
@trevor_cole *nods*
@OneChrisEdwards indeed. And this is the first draft. I'll need two rewrites at least.
@OneChrisEdwards a slim novel. 45-50k. I feel like that's the right length, anyway. Who has time for 100k words - esp. if  not necessary?
@OneChrisEdwards yep. I'm that crazy.
You read it and think, "that's the kind of love I want." And if you have it, now, the next feeling might be terror.
It helps that the subjects are beautiful people. But he captures true and enduring love - how rare and fragile and irreplaceable it is.
This @oconnorwrites piece is so beautifully written: 


"Sept. Fell in love on the 7th." 

Fitzgerald's ledger of his life: 
@blm849 I will. Thank you.
@trevor_cole and, thank you.
@trevor_cole Flow is affected, for sure. Have had feedback that it's hard to read from bottom up. Perhaps 'story' template would be better?
Everything is about mental toughness. Everything.
@blm849 You do both 'wise man' and 'fool' remarkably well.
@blm849 I just LOL'd. I really enjoy your tweets.
@geoffmomin Pfft. Momin.
@OneChrisEdwards Handsome?
@JDhalperin Passable. So how it works is that at the stroke of midnight, we share a smoke, and then I challenge you to a duel...
@navalang Oh, Nav.
Just wrote a poem. Someone call the coast guard.
A Saturday night shout out to the intrepid @markusoff, for generalized awesomeness.
@ivortossell makers. They are sandwich makers.
A collection of my tweets on Fitzgerald's The Crack Up, for anyone suffering artistic crisis / generalized despair: 

@shawnmicallef thank you kindly. The Crack Up's a nice piece to read in the sober light of day (hungover or not).
...and, with any luck, the future, as well.
...which is directed at others, and has the power to change your externalities, your life's present shape...
The trick is to keep striving - not for happiness, which is always a kind of serendipitous accident - but for goodness...
Without hope, you die (and he did, too young).
If I could presume to add anything, it's a clear opening in my mind, on a morning with that first frost that makes everything look new.
I'd argue that he's been proven right: words are more important to us now than ever (witness, here, the form).
...where personality was worn down to the inevitable low gear of collaboration."
...was becoming subordinated to a mechanical and communal art...in which words were subordinate to images,
"I saw that the novel, which at my maturity was the strongest and supplest medium for conveying thought and emotion...
7. The written word is still the best vehicle for conveying human thought and emotion.
In the style of his later years - slowly spiraling toward an alcoholic's death - he leaves it there. But he does make one more urgent point.
"I do not any longer like the postman, nor the grocer...he in turn will come to dislike me, so that life will never be very pleasant again."
6. (I'm taking some license here) If you relinquish hope altogether, you remove the possibility of joy, no matter how seemingly small.
Fitzgerald, as always, links the death of hope to growing older. I agree. It gets harder to keep up hope. Disappointment piles up.
5. This striving isn't going to make you happy. "The natural state of the sentient adult is a qualified unhappiness."
4. To be great you have to strive for this humanity. You have to try to be good.
...men who didn’t care whether the world tumbled into chaos tomorrow if it spared their houses."
"I felt like the beady-eyed men I used to see on the commuting train from Great Neck fifteen years back --
3. The striving for kindness and compassion, when removed, creates a void and is an escape to nothing.
"identification such as this spells the death of accomplishment. It is something like this that keeps sane people from working."
2. A writer who identifies with his subject is doomed. He's also the better man.
More than embraced...it needs to be welcomed in gently, offered a chair and a warm drink, and then you rail against and for both sides.
1. Cognitive dissonance needs to be embraced. One should see that things are "hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise."
It's terrible writing - he really vomited all over the page, so I'll attempt to summarize:
If you can get through it, Fitzgerald's The Crack Up explains almost everything. His worst - and best - work.


Full goth. So me. Happy Halloween. 
@karenkho You are stunning.
You should read @trevor_cole 's primer on narcissists. Could save you a lot of grief if you know what to look for. 
@trevor_cole Well-said. Thank you.
@idontlikemunday bravo!
Things that don't matter:

social status 

success, if you have to betray others 

what others think - unless they're people you respect
Things that matter:

how you treat others, especially when chips are down
how hard you work
are you able to be honest w/ yourself &amp; others?
@GaryInToronto it was no problem really. You're a kind and lovely person. It was my privilege to meet you and I'm glad it helped.
@andknf yep. which is why it's so delicate.
One of hardest things to navigate in friendships is when to reach out to &amp; say, "hey, I'm here if you need me." It leaves you both exposed.
@stevemaich Complicated. Women are often taught to apologize / assume blame. Then there are all the other (valid) reasons to not report.
...but if men can better understand what women deal with, perhaps that awareness creates a kind of safety net so we're not totally alone.
I don't know what can possibly change without burning certain aspects of our culture to the ground...
Took a lot of guts to do that interview on Ghomeshi, even anonymously.

@marykilmer No problem. It must be a very difficult day for you. Sending good karma.
@marykilmer Sorry for your loss, Mary.
@robertwakulat Voted already. Am hiding.
@robertwakulat Is anybody?
Once again, and I'm sure not for the last time: Toronto is a hologram.
@simonkinglaw did you just *acronym* "rest of canada?" I rest my case.
@WrightRyan aren't you in Greece? I hear there is good light there.
Cities are things. They are increasingly where we live. They don't have a moral underpinning. They just are.

@flying_steve Can I get 15 half-eaten cheeseburgers to go?

"You're inspecting me," he says. 

Here it is. She follows this wrinkle with the tip of her finger.
Like a sculptor works with closed eyes, her hands know every line of this face.
He smiles at her, close up, his eyes shining. What's this, she thinks, as her hand traces his cheek in the dark.
@robertwakulat likewise.
@robertwakulat the most unpredictable hearts belong to those who have suffered. They lash out or strike inward.
@robertwakulat youtube is your friend. Midori. Tchaikovsky violin concerto.
@robertwakulat I used to get my ethical check in looking at homeless people freezing outside our empty building.
@andreweckford thank you.
@analyticeye you're kind to say that. Thank you.
@GaryInToronto you're one of the good ones, Gary.
Not Pollyanna, though. You don't get "happy" by being good. Because happiness isn't the end goal. Goodness is.
Perhaps deep in Pollyanna groove, but inner peace comes from how you treat others. Not happiness. Peace. The ability to look self in mirror.
@marykilmer thank you. It's the view from my condo, south of Lakeshore.
Actually, you totally are. Ah well. As you were.
As long as your principles are intact, you are never alone.
@GaryInToronto it will be out Christmas concert. I'll send you the deets.
Fantastic concert. Soloist Francine Kay was amazing. Also, my arms hurt.

@ptypk thanks, Peggy. I'll accidentally play in at least one rest for you.

Dear neighbours: I am sorry about the six hours of violin in store for you today. My neck is also sorry.
Always answer your door. Lovely to meet @ThomsonTO .

@GaryInToronto aww, Gary. Let's get together soon. Sorry things haven't been great.
@andreweckford Yes! Oddly I don't think we ever did during all my time at York.
@andreweckford I'll be having a housewarming party at some point. Of course you are invited. :)
The problem with feeling so happy &amp; content is one all creative people face, I guess. In my case, not conducive to tortured-novel-writing.
Gosh, what a gorgeous day. Distractingly perfect.

@andreweckford @analyticeye does it taste as delicious as it looks?
@GaryInToronto great! It's been too long.
There really is such a thing as too much civilization.
Sunsets like these make a mockery out of every single thing we've crafted with our clumsy hands and even clumsier minds.
And just when I thought this sunset couldn't get prettier...here nature goes again, outdoing us. 
Chill, chill evening. 
@snobiwan so you're coming, then?
Oct. 19 concert w/ @orchtoronto includes Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. My favorite recording, w/ Gould &amp; the TSO: 

(I may need to buy myself a drink as well, seeing as my stand partner is my dad. Just kidding. Of course.)
I'm playing in @orchtoronto, Oct. 19, 3pm, Toronto Centre for the Arts. Please come. I will buy you a drink.

@blm849 yes. Also, it feels great.

@GaryInToronto cherry.
@andreweckford are you a fan of @joythebaker ? This is a woman with some serious respect for pie (and great recipes).
Feels like a weekend to bake pie.
Can I hire someone to help me unpack from this move? Is there an app for this?
Bears repeating: Worry about courage. Don't worry about failure unless it comes through your own fault. 
@m_melody @snobiwan only ever played violin by myself in Ottawa. Sad violin. In the tunnels at Carleton and occasionally on Sparks Street.
