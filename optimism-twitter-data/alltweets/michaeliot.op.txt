*cop huddles with his partner*
@jameshunker we could
@jameshunker we have taken a step back, and I could discuss at length all the reasons why (in my opinion)
@jameshunker which shows that we, as a culture have not matured enough to have the right discussion
@jameshunker I think it's important that a movie like this should raise a discussion, it's just raised the wrong one
@jameshunker it has become more than the movie itself, it's about the message taken away from the movie (which isnt always the intended one)
@jameshunker a lot of people took to social media after the release of the movie promoting hate, sparking controversy
@jameshunker much of the controversy comes not from the message of the movie, but the public takeaway which oft fell for the latter
@jameshunker a discussion on the impact of war on an individual level
@jameshunker I think at this point it's become people using the controversy to advance their own political agenda rather than
@jameshunker implying what he did there was a thing worthy of praise
@jameshunker military occupation of the middle east is a controversial topic, and we made a movie about a "hero" of the war
@jameshunker I also believe it's because it's about a war that was controversial in itself
@jameshunker well with American sniper, it's centered on the guy who killed the most terrorists in the whole war
@jameshunker zero dark thirty, to my understanding, was mostly "we killed osama, woohoo! Fuck yeah, USA USA!"
@jameshunker which is why it's not a pro war film
@jameshunker saving private Ryan wasn't "about" killing germans, it was about saving private ryan
@jameshunker to be fair that was both from a different time, and focused completely different than modern war movies
@jameshunker don't see how this movie sparked controversy but zero dark thirty was totally fine

@Micaylabug so you missed the entire point of what I said
@Micaylabug not to mention the fact that I said it "enables" them. It makes it easier, it's not the only thing that makes it possible
@Micaylabug people have also been defending themselves long before guns so your argument is weak
Just because you can use a gun does not mean you are going to be a hero one day. Your priority should be your own safety
The replies to my opinion on GUNS on a COLLEGE CAMPUS explains what I don't like about Texas
@Micaylabug guns enable people to do something stupid and illegal, and enable retaliation
@megastahr There are many ways to keep yourself safe in case of an active shooter, the last resort is to fight
@megastahr license to carry is not training to be a hero.
@megastahr violence begets violence. The goal is to create an environment of security, not fear. No one should have a gun

If Senate Bill 11 passes, I'm outta here. I'm not going to school with a bunch of gun toting Texans
My main concern is that SB-17 (lifting restrictions on open carry) passed 20 to 11... Senate Bill 11 concerns college campuses
Bill McRaven is the chancellor for the UT system for those who don't know
As far as concealed carry on campus, it's not been voted on, but Bill McRaven has urged senators to vote against it, Dr. Karbhari agrees

I need to decide if I actually want to go to RTX this year since I'm not gonna be a guardian
Me: Sure
*God uses 2 fingers to gently close the eyes of an entire rain forest*
Where's the line between self absorbed and concerned about my own well being
@Go_Faster_Wings i hate myself for being a self absorbed prick
But seriously I don't think people realize I treat my life like a joke because I think being awful and worthless is funny
I really think people's perception of me is skewed by stuff like the things I do and what I say
I'm aware I'm a train wreck and my life is a joke so don't feel guilty when you make fun of me
I definitely want to figure out how that whole "family of friends" works
How long can I get away with blaming my dad leaving for all the problems in my life
Like Phoebe would say, "I don't even have a pl-"
Meanwhile I don't have plans for my life beyond: get away
The thing that pisses me off is that he has a job at Lockheed Martin and is going to be making a disgusting amount of money
In conclusion: I hate my life, I hate my brother, and I hate myself
And I'm a total asshole
He's also even more self absorbed than I am
But even for someone so smart he's wrong a lot. He just is incapable of admitting it
I'm sure it seems like I'm biased but his only good quality is he's smart
I know I complain about my brother a lot but if you met him you wouldn't like him either
Let me go put a blanket over her she's in a ball on the couch and you haven't checked on her in over 10 minutes
because you've been in the bathroom for half an hour
Sorry she was puking and I got her water and also cleaned her up because she had to throw up in the kitchen
After telling me I made her throw up because she drank half a bottle of water in 20 minutes
He just gave her Pepto and walked off
At least I'm still checking on her every 2 minutes and making sure she's feeling better
Even though he just went to his room and left my sister in the kitchen moaning in distress
But my brother is supposed to be taking care of her because apparently I don't know how to help someone who just threw up
And I'm so fucking self absorbed because my sister threw up and I'm just complaining about MY problems
Every little thing becomes negative I hate my surroundings I can't stand it honestly
I'm not around positive people and everyone at my house is so negative it just overwhelms me with negative energy and i loathe everything
I'm just to the point that i loathe any interaction with my brother I'd be fine if I never spoke to him again
