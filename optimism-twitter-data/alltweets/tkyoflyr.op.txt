@CXAXV what bass vst did you use for 'Everyday' dude? Or was that even a vst? haha
is producing in Ableton decent on a 13 inch macbook? Or is worth getting a 15inch? #abletonlive #Apple #MacBook #macbookpro
@CXAXV 'Everyday' makes me feel very happy and optimistic. Thank you.

Plans for tomorrow if I get time 
create your own culture
@owen_farrington ah cmon man, it was one small mistake. He could have wrote that easy but he jus wasn't feelin it at the time. #DaVinci4pres
@owen_farrington naaaaaah mate. DaVinci would have rocked Ableton and been the best rapper in the renaissance if it had been invented
Kanye comparing himself to DaVinci actually happened
@diversamusic social anxiety
When got hear a jersey club kick pattern on a Dan Bilzerian video, it's already too late
@_mrcarmack dat face
My entire music taste stems from Daft Punk
@HeavyMellow same
@CASHMERECAT those snapchats were the first time I've ever heard your voice
@dearmothica what if I sent u a future bass r&amp;b track with trap hihats?
tomorrow I practice biiiiiggg 808s
@samgellaitry you've created the best melody this year so far with the 2nd half of 'Childhood' imo. Seriously good fucking work man
How hard is it to stay humble? Jesus Christ
@ThisIsCMKM thank you! You too! <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Sleep well
You're in bed, it's pitch black and it's getting hot. You take off your T-shirt and throw it across the room. It gets thrown back...
@mura_masa_ I appreciate that little break of silence in 'Firefly' so much man. Fucking incredible EP!!
@dearmothica <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

@atlantisistaken just the cashmere cat voice. I can never get a clean voice that sounds constant, there's always tiny cuts where it resets
@tkyoflyr @atlantisistaken hey man, saw an Instagram post a while ago and you had it nailed. How do you stop the cuts?

trying to tell a story through sounds 
@Lidogotsongs the superspeed EP is very good! 'Too Late !' Reminds me of some weird robot duet from WALL-E, love it!
@dearmothica aww I missed it. Pls can you send me the link? <SPARKLES>
@Fred_Delicious [inserts dildo into mouth]
[dildo explodes]

@_mrcarmack I agree but tell that to @deadmau5
@deadmau5 very true but it's hard to see the success when the market for this is already saturated as fuck. I'm pretty damn sceptical anyway
@deadmau5 nope. just can't see the success rn, but hey prove me wrong. I'm just way too invested in Soundcloud atm
@deadmau5 looks like you sold your soul for a new Ferrari with Tidal. Tell me if it was worth it once it flops
I only know how to make chilled stuff
@Lidogotsongs yeah I can play that one

@Stel_Leo_69 thanks for the shoutout man <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Best tweet of 2015 so far 
I need to go to sxsw next year to express my hipster self
Alison Brie is goooood
When u do something first and somebody else does it and u don't give a fuck
Think I've found where Minecraft get there mining noise from in the Xfer Deadmau5 pack 
@diversamusic 
Finally made a song that I would listen to
Just made something really fucking cool
Mixing sub bass can fucking hard
Jesus memes are fun, now I sleep

Do you ever look at a human and think 'this is what an alien would look like to an alien'?
@Fkjmusic you got some serious skills on the keys bruh. The 'Fly' remix is incredible!
@CASHMERECAT yo
A lot of the songs I like are in D major
Listening back to music you have made and actually enjoying it, is one of the most gratifying feelings ever
And by sampling stupid shit like their cat or their mum and making it into a shitty remix for attention. This is what demotivates me
Seems like any 'DJs' can get verified on Facebook and build a fan base nowadays by using loops off beatport
Mmhmmm harmonies <SPARKLES> 
I just wanna make cool mall music and retire at 30

@Fred_Delicious [dildo explodes and Micheal Bay rides off into the sunset]
Tryna make a Pharrell groove 
Drum racks in Ableton are the devil. Unless you're programming hi-hats...then it's cool
Just one day in the studio with Pharrell and I can die happy
Dogs must think their shit is valuable if humans keep picking it up
What's this in my pocket?

@CASHMERECAT YESSSSS PLSSSS MAN
How do people find that funny at all?!
Diplo retweeting a video of a bus crash where most likely everyone died on board synced up to his music. Like wtf
@diplo fuck you
@marinjuana_ @diplo @Skrillex @OWSLA @maddecent I've lost faith in humanity. This is disgraceful. Smh.
@CASHMERECAT how you get your voices for your songs so clean and crisp must be a pretty close secret. Heard nothing like it yet
My favourite Saul Goodman quote: "Badger fell head first into the doodoo pile and came out smelling like Pacco Rabanne"

Keep moving in silence.

Franz Liszt is the only classical composer for me. His music is fucking beautiful
Jaden Smith is good

fl studio: "do you want to save this project file?"
Just proving a point
Let the beat talk
@Lidogotsongs coming to the UK anytime soon man? I need to see your brilliance live <GRIMACING FACE>
I was about to open Ableton, then I listed to @samgellaitry's EP and decided to quit. You killed it...bruh
@officialjaden lol
I normally don't buy my music but I'll make an exception for @samgellaitry. Can't wait for this man! <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 
It's all about classical love songs bruh
@_mrcarmack Franz Liszt? 'Love Dream' is incredible
FUCK THE GRAMMYS
It's a Flying Lotus type of day

quiet storm

@PYRMDPLAZA Those chords in 'STRSHP' man, mmmmmmmmm!
Honestly cannot wait for @samgellaitry's EP. Gonna be a game changer!

classic
Imagine if Justin Timberlake never made Justified
Do I give a shit about the Super Bowl?

Answer: No
sometimes the validity of sampling a beat can be questioned. Which is why I'm going to compose an original next and put 100% effort into it
BEAAATTZZZ 
New beat 
Everything by @_mrcarmack <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ one of the best producers around

@Lidogotsongs realest string of tweets ever
Spent that much time in soundcloud that I've been on an artist's page as they've got a banner
Yes I still play NHL 12 on my 360
Is a mini mini bus just a car?
:( 
Most of tonight has been spent looking at chord progressions

Nobody has flow like GoldLink. It's like when you run down a hill and your legs can't catch up with your body and youre about to fall down
And no I'm not high
What if the universe is just a waiting room and when we die our consciousness enters a higher dimension?
So many I need to see
I can't remember a time where there was this many good films out atm

Let's stop killing Rhinos, okay?
Just wrote my first release
@flumemusic your fans crack me up 
@Lidogotsongs no UK dates? <WEARY FACE>
@Lidogotsongs ho-lee shit!!!!!! <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
This is what's wrong with the music industry 
iPhone recordings for guitar can actually work if you put a shit load of reverb and fab filter on it
@heavyxmellow remix nearly done <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
I want to make music that is warm
Soundcloud is my home. So therefore my home is built on sand <FIRE>
@KiloMurda cool, but you need to find a working Keygen for the rest of your customers

Brian McKnight - Never Felt So Good is the greatest piano ballad ever made
It's half five in the evening, 3 degrees and pitch black and the ice cream van is out. This sums up where I live perfectly
