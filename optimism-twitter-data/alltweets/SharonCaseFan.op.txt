Love that Sabrina/Michael and Elizabeth/Jake are next to eachother in the opening sequences.&lt;3 #GH
Wait, I can't believe DAYS viewers actually like this Discount EJ person lol
@jamdownrocks something like this happened in my old unit except, it was more of like a dead-smell, and there was a dead possum.It was gross
@jamdownrocks My uncle is coming over later so I will just figure it out with him.
@jamdownrocks Yes.
@jamdownrocks It's been there for the last 2 days. I don't know if it's just the rain? But it's def something I've never had before.
ugh I can smell something toxic like paint/ink in my house. It's creeping me out. :|

OMG <FLUSHED FACE> #YR #Shylan 
@JTRules1 DM
@teeveejeff @erika_kay10 yes
cc: @TeresaLuvz @duelly87 
@erika_kay10 It makes sense. They had chemistry. Both of them have continued flop romances
@SaveOurSoap wait where is this coming from?
@erika_kay10 They should put Neil and Ashley together tbh
@Julie_Foxy You're here but I feel like you are doing something else too right now lol
Twitter is so dry right now there's like no one here while I am xD Time difference
Elizabeth &amp; Jason | love me like you do 
LITERALLY, the only thing Sabrina doesn't do for Carrrrlos is breast feed him. Well, we don't know how their relationship was tho lol #GH
Carrrrlos doesn't love Sabrina. He treats her like his mother. He just uses her because his worthless as has nobody else. Ughh #GH
Duke :( #GH
Oh f****, Carrrrlos is freakin alive. And not only that, he's come back to Sabrina again. GRRRR. Just GO AWAY you imbecile. #GH
Sakey's 4th kiss&lt;3 #GH
Aw Sabrina is talking about Patrick, and Gabriel &lt;/3 I don't care what certain pressed ppl said, Patrina were great together. #GH
Vote for Shylan if you haven't! Don't be lazy. Lol 
Sabrina playing hard to get. I SEE you ;). #GH #Sakey
Ughhh Sloane shut up #GH
I keep saying it but Robin should never have been brought back. The fact that she's still being held captive is just POINTLESS. #GH
Sabrina's taste in men is so scattered. Carrrlos.... Patrick .... Michael? She attracts so many different types lol. #GH
Ummm isn't Olivia only FIVE months pregnant? I am so confused 0_o #GH
Jordan is such a QUEEN. #GH
"Adventure buddy" awwww Samtrick&lt;3 #GH
Lmao imagine if Olivia was like "thank god the're gone.....ok now I can stop faking" *gets up, walks out* LOL #GH
omg Julian is so insensitive #GH
See now, THAT's how it's done. Glad Jordan just shot Bruce without hesitating. Carrrrrlos take notes. Lol. #GH
Sabrina "What about Kiki?"
Michael "What about her?"
Lol #GH
OMG YAS Jordan is a boss #GH
Ugh Sloane get out of Anna's face. So annoying. #GH
Michael wants Sabrina so much omg. Kiki who??? #GH #Sakey
lmaoo Maxie thinks Jake is still under mind control #GH
Michael and Sabrina are a breath of fresh air. They are developing naturally &amp; have genuine chemistry; not just a plot point. #GH #Sakey
so, Ellie/Spinelli are in Maxie's home? That's just weird. This 'happy' couples switch is a bit weird lol #GH
omg Sakey&lt;3 #GH
This Shylan kiss #2 buzz just interrupted the movie I was watching <GRIMACING FACE>
@sharonlcase @TeamSharonYR @WeeklyCountdown @TVSource you deserve it Sharon <FACE THROWING A KISS> we love you
@Julie_Foxy LOL i saw that
@redpoca Dylan
These Avery clowns claim to hate Dylan &amp; Sharon yet can't stop talking about them? Thanks for the #Shylan buzz, kids. 
@Julie_Foxy LMAO! Cindy and I once had this long thread with two of the idiots. Basically they couldn't refute a point I made &amp; blocked me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@yrfan92 <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Thank you!
@jamdownrocks @Julie_Foxy @ILuvSoapyDrama was just scrolling thru old pics and LOL 
#FreeAvery &lt;----- lmao! The only people who need freeing are viewers from this insipid character &amp; her irrelevant offscreen history <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
Omg guys
@ILuvSoapyDrama OMG I can't <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@soapoperanurse3 Lol. Ugh they need to end Davery ASAP. No one is here for them
OMG WHAT <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>  
well... the #YR promo looks stupid lol what's new
Aw Hunter :( #QueensofDrama
omg Donna is so shady in such a classy way #QueensofDrama
They are taking this so seriously, It's pretty obvious Hunter was joking. #QueensofDrama
Donna is such a Queen, omg. #QueensofDrama
Omg Crystal full on lying LMAO #QueensofDrama
"Clearly Han resents our success"
"I know, why can't women be happy for eachother"
OMG Max stop #2BrokeGirls
@boogieXlove Lol don't
"I see a small failure" *Han walks in* "I take it back, you are good" LMAO poor Han :( #2BrokeGirls
@boogieXlove Well I am a Daniel hater so.. xD
@boogieXlove I hope so. They need to get her away from Daniel. I love Ericole. Too bad Nicole was thrown under the bus AGAIN sigh
@boogieXlove I can't believe she STILL is childless. Meanwhile Sami got 3 kids + that other baby who died within a 2 year period. Ugh :(
@boogieXlove I loved Sharon as an Abbott, finally dropping the Newman name &amp; living in the mansion but, I liked her chemistry w/ Brad more
@boogieXlove I don't even get why Nicole had to lose the child with EJ. So stupid.
@boogieXlove The writers never give Nicole a proper pairing. The fact that she's stick with you know who now is tragic
@boogieXlove I wanted her with Brad so badly in 2006. Brad/Victoria sucked
@boogieXlove I did not like EJole at all, bc I did fall for EJami in 2008. I wanted Nicole with Brady
@boogieXlove IKR? I love Lumi. Lumi+Shick were my first OTPs. I hate how abruptly they ended their 2012 reunion. I felt cheated
@boogieXlove He had so much potential but was stuck on Y&amp;R all those years. Brad had no direction. I did like him &amp; Sharon tho
@boogieXlove Aw ok. I saw the chemistry. But I shipped Sami with everyone except Rafe. Did u like Lumi, my OTP?
@boogieXlove Aw I liked Brad but he got no good storylines. Its good that Don went to B&amp;B where Bill is relevant
@boogieXlove So I'm assuming u don't like Ejami?
@boogieXlove and yea I find most of Ashley's romances boring. Brad, Tucker etc zzz
@boogieXlove I loved Ashley and Neil. It's so hard to remember them. They should put them back together.
@boogieXlove I liked it when Ashley was living on the ranch in 2009 when Victor was gone
@boogieXlove *get the fact that L&amp;L being together is in the past.
@boogieXlove I wish they would just split them up and bring them together when one of them leaves for a second. Like I'm glad TG and GF *
@boogieXlove They bore me. I mean not even their quarrels are interesting considering Victurd acts like he is a saint
@boogieXlove Ikr? she needs to leave him. She is so much more interesting away from him
@boogieXlove That was all so cliched and boring. Victor is just ugh
@boogieXlove lmaoo. I actually liked Nikki/Jack getting back together in 2012. Too bad she left him after like 9 milliseconds
@Julie_Foxy I actually used to like Still but then Katie had her annual heart attack lol that s/l was so dumb.
@Julie_Foxy lmao that party scene cracked me up. Katie was like "You're too old to get pregnant!" #dead
@boogieXlove I did used to enjoy Nikki I just don't like her.
@Julie_Foxy Brill made me gag. I mean..  Katie tells them to "be together" (clearly over-reacting) so they have sex right after? Sick.
@Julie_Foxy I didn't even like that. I liked Nick/Bridget and Nick/Taylor. I don't think I like any Brooke pairings.
@Julie_Foxy I love to hate that bitch (Brooke ofc, KKL is great). For her to grow they need to acknowledge her disorder first
@carolfeige22 @Julie_Foxy was that the one on the beach from years ago? Yea that was sad
@boogieXlove Oh you know I LOVE Empress Ava. Lol no to Nikki
@Julie_Foxy Meh. I liked when Stephanie treated her like trash. Lol. Them being BFFs made no sense and was awkward
@boogieXlove ugh we really need to find a mutual soap fave lol
@Julie_Foxy I loved them too ofc, mostly when Stephanie was beating the f*** out of Brooke's skank ass. But ew. And Brill afterwards. Gross
@WendyJRE @BBohaty &lt;33 how old is she?
@WendyJRE @BBohaty omg sooo cute.
@Julie_Foxy Well I liked everything apart from the actual death scene. That ho Brooke xD
@Julie_Foxy Stephanie's death made me cry. Like... and its not like I watched from the beginning. IT was so sad
@boogieXlove lol
@Julie_Foxy I read that he wants an exit like Susan Flannery's. They did such a good job on writing Stephanie's death. I loved that party
@boogieXlove smart xD
@Julie_Foxy I thought he wants to be killed off
@boogieXlove LOL&lt;3 and when is your birthday again?
@WendyJRE @BBohaty Take more pics lol &lt;3
@boogieXlove LMAO don't troll me like that xD well I do enjoy sarcasm
omg 5 people DM'ing me at once. I feel so famous. jk lol
@boogieXlove <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Julie_Foxy IKR? gahhh it was perfect. You saw my camera roll lol
@Julie_Foxy Aww ok. *Forgets so I can be surprised* lol
@Julie_Foxy Lol that's so me xD
@Julie_Foxy I did. It's July 5
@WendyJRE @BBohaty OMGGGGG ADORABLEE &lt;333 when did this happen?!
Aww Amy and Sheldon met 5 years ago. :') #TBBT
@larrywitness lmao crazy. They just go around trolling Betty-related conversations
@larrywitness lmao which one? Wait,  Betty is a cheater tho. She cheated on Joe w/ Dylan and now emotionally cheating on Dylan w/ Joe. Ho
@JTRules1 ugh Lane fans are getting annoying like stop it lol give other couples a chance. Plus Lane are boring. Need to split up
@Julie_Foxy yes
@Julie_Foxy I heard that your fav show got cancelled. Sorry to hear. :(
So this season of TBBT is already over. It went so quickly. And I feel like nothing that interesting happened this season.
Geary is leaving #GH? Well, the character has done enough.
@hope4567 @ShylanNation @TKapyamba @TVMusicRider @LG3Tweets2 @jtandcolleen @SabahMasood @hachiko_1989 @HedringtoAlta31 thanks :)
@TKapyamba DM
@larrywitness Lol thats bc your right. It's just the same 3-5 always bitching on about irrelevant Avery Crocker. #No1cares
A doppelganger, Sharon being unstable/getting the blame for everything, plastic surgery, etc. Wow, #YR are SO creative...
@ILuvSoapyDrama DM
Lol Betty fans. Keep hating on Queen Sharon. won't change the fact that Betty has absolutely no chemistry with Dylan, or anyone. #YR #Shylan
Sage/Sandy is like another Avery. So pointless. Take them all off the show. #YR
Lane are about to overtake Shylan. You guys better be voting 
Liz haters saying she's thirsty etc. No. Hayden- now that's thirst lol. Liason is LUHH. <PURPLE HEART> #GH
Sorry, but what's gonna happen if Jason remembers who he is? A Sam/Patrick/Jason triangle? Jason goes back to working for Sonny? <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE> #GH

@BigBBfan1 DM
@WendyJRE @3WishGenie @BBohaty ew wtf... 
@USNCS LMFAOOOO omg
"Sorry we quarreled" LMFAOOO Betty is so lame even in text form #YR
@BBohaty @WendyJRE @3WishGenie well that's a bit dramatic lol
@WendyJRE @3WishGenie @BBohaty <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> that's just weird to me. I know she's of legal age but no. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
So JFP/Pratt are saying...if Sharon didn't lost custody of Faith, we would have been denied of good story-telling? lmao #YR
wait so Whoregan knows the truth about Maya? Smh. That nosy bitch is everywhere. #BoldandBeautiful
Brooke and Ridge have no chemistry lol #BoldandBeautiful
@ILuvSoapyDrama DEAD
@BigBBfan1 omg Cindy where are you
@ILuvSoapyDrama Wait she said that ? LMAO all I saw was Queen Sharon's creative &amp; insightful response. What a weird bitch Betty is
Although I hate that Sharon is being made to look like a villain again, it's kind of funny that she's trolling dumbass Betty. Lmao. #YR
@BBohaty @jamdownrocks Guys you need to lay off QUEEN Lysa Arryn. Where are u @WendyJRE? They are dissing our Queen.
@jamdownrocks He's so lazy and random lol
@jamdownrocks How can you dis my Queen?? She is amazing
Guys keep voting for Shylan! They deserve way mroe votes. #YR #ShylanFirstKiss 
@jamdownrocks aw Sam&lt;33 He's adorable
@jamdownrocks LMAO Lysa. Queen
@jamdownrocks Lol yes
LMAO Sharon &amp; Dylan both seemed so high after their kiss. They were like "no big deal" "just a friendly kiss" WTF? I love them. #YR
@Julie_Foxy judging you <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> you know how I feel about Trash
@Julie_Foxy 
@Julie_Foxy they passed in January 2013 lol
Wait there was a mouse in Madonna's bathroom?! LMAOOO
The nurses ball &amp; then live shows. This is why #GH is the best soap. They care not only about staying on the air, but to please viewers.
@jamdownrocks they think by next gen, we want Summer/Abby. LMAO no. Sharon-Nicholas-Phyllis etc should always lead
I cannot with fake people lol
@BBohaty @jamdownrocks @WendyJRE ew. Don't even say that.
@WendyJRE @BBohaty @jamdownrocks Lol yes. I love him. he's adorable tbh
Keep voting Shylan guysss. Let's get them to 200+ #YR 
@BBohaty @jamdownrocks @WendyJRE Even if they were twins they would suck as a couple. They are toxic &amp; Jaime is more likable away from her
JFP/Pratt are confused. Them giving us storylines that are only for shock effect &amp; become boring shortly after is not good writing. #YR
@AngelicaMcD @YRInsider
Shylan kiss <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> #YR
@soapoperanurse3 @ILuvSoapyDrama Yup. Davery and Navery are both weak &amp; need propping from all ends
@TxKimmie @Julie_Foxy @jamdownrocks true but then why would Sharon do that. It's always a bigger picture for her and in a bad way lol
#YR look at how many people care about Davery: 
If Sharon sent a fake text to Phyllis or someone, I wouldn't care. But AVERY tho? Someone as pointless &amp; irrelevant as Avery? Bye #YR
Now that Christine has been back on the canvas for a while, Avery is pointless. She's just Christine who bakes <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
Sending a text is something any other character could do and get away with but bc it's Sharon, everyone will hate her <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR #SaveSharon
@AlanSarapa wait so this is #YR even AFTER they shot down some of his ideas? <SKULL> 
done <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
So thank you #YR for ruining the moment for Shylan fans all because of Avery, a character no one gives a crap about. Great writing as usual<WEARY FACE>
So the charges against Sharon are dropped and Shylan kiss, but these "writers" still have to do something to screw things up #YR
#YR need to write Joe and Avery off. They are useless. Take them off-scene where their love story took place <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@erika_kay10 LMAO yes. MAB did have good stuff. She just got carried away &amp; agenda took over. Pratt just doesn't get it period.
@Julie_Foxy @jamdownrocks Smh I swear I can't with this train wreck anymore. Sharon propping Davery is a mess
Don't JFP and Pratt realise WHY people aren't loving them? Even if they don't care about #YR history &amp; future, viewers do. <THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
@luvscharmed thanks for the suggestion
None of Avery's couples even made it to the top 8 on a poll of #YR couples LMAO that says enough about the show's "lead". #DeathToDavery
@jamdownrocks no. I dread that. What did the 'people' say <UNAMUSED FACE>
Bill Bell KNEW how to write and didn't need to rely on thrills and shocks that keep audiences interested for about 5 seconds. FAIL #YR
Just have to go and ruin Shylan before they even begin. I do not trust the hack with this show. Not at all. #YR
anyone who thinks #YR is good right now is delusional. It's awful. Bill Bell would be appalled.
#YR had something beautiful in Shylan's potential now they wanna have Sharon screw it up. Whatever writers. Keep your boring ass couples
@soapoperanurse3 ugh fuck this show <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@ILuvSoapyDrama of course there is a reason. The writers hate Sharon and she can never do anything write.
Shylan have potential to be a beautiful love story but instead they have Sharon propping Davery who have NO chemistry &amp; are awful. #YR
I feel like Jean &amp; Shelly stabilised #YR. It wasn't the best last year but it was stable after the Griffith mess. Now Pratt ugh
Pratt is delusional if he thinks that Sharon is better crazy &amp; Abby/Summer should be leads. I FEAR for this show. #YR
Wtf is this I'm hearing about Sharon texting dumbass Betty from Dylan's phone? I guess she's on Davery propping duty. Fuck this show <FACE THROWING A KISS> #YR
@denatchka *and if they are suddenly reunited, you're right, it will be forced. I agree
@denatchka *Sam. There will be not 'development' apart from the type of scenes they've been having. They've already been chemistry tested*
@denatchka Same. If Jason remembers, even if it's just half of his memories, they can't write the story as anything but him running back to*
@minniepearl74 Voted no one on B&amp;B; the top 4 there suck. Hope/Bo on Days. Liason GH. Shylan Y&amp;R
@minniepearl74 omg I am judging you so hard right now. Like really...LOL. Seriously judging
@minniepearl74 LOL... And yup I did. Did u vote for Shylan on the Y&amp;R one
"I don't want you to leave" sigdgudfh ITS COMING *fans self* #GH #Liason
Ohmygod have sex already lol #GH #Liason
Omg Maxie shut up about the boxing match already. #GH
Liason giving me those feels omg. This is so wrong and IDC, I love it LOL. Looking forward to the guaranteed Liz screen time. Yass&lt;3 #GH
@denatchka Same. If BM had more chemistry with KeMo, then I'd go for JaSam 2.0. But I can't because I hardly saw any sparks there.
@SweetmamaBrandi was that necessary lol
@babysbreath20 but even if he and Sam were reunited, I just cannot see the romantic chemistry. Patrick is a better match for her now.
Guys, vote for Shylan. 
I love SamTrick. To me they aren't worth breaking up for the reveal lol. #GH
When Jason discovers the truth and goes back to Sam it still won't change the fact that BM has more chem with BH.... #GH
Their second date&lt;333 :') #GH
Wait what is Hayden talking about Nikolas doing with his tongue? This is a daytime show guys, tone it down lol. #GH
Don't hate me but... Jake and Sam give me brother-sister/friendship vibes. The romantic chemistry is with BM &amp; BH. #GH #Liason
Yess Queen Liz lettin her hurr down. #GH
lmaoo Hayden still thirsty. #GH
Lol Liz is like "oh right that thing with Ric happened" xD #GH
Nathan and Ellie scenes are cute. #GH
@BBohaty just a lot of album filler I never listen to
@WendyJRE such a joke. And Bieber's fans need to stop even mentioning Michael in the same sentence as that person.
WTF  
I just deleted 350 songs from my iTunes. I feel SO liberated
It makes zero sense for Adam to not even care that Sharon is being framed. Just saying. These plot-driven storylines suck. #YR
Omg @BigBBfan1 we need to play that picture game again xD I died seriously
LMFAO this was hilarious. I mean, the storyline was terrible, but Sharon kills me. She is too funny. #YR 
@soapsindepthabc Victor is just trolling everyone in GC at this point. Sonny is selfish &amp; reckless. Victor is pure evil. #YR
Dickolas was like "that's not my job blah blah" shut up. I don't want your caveman ass around Queen Sharon ever again #YR
@jamdownrocks lmao I LOL'd when she said that. Haha
Pratt's stories clearly aren't working so far. The Fack thing was a shock at first, but now, it's just stupid. The killer s/l is horrid. #YR
Sharon says "find this killer" and the screen pans to Fake Jack... so he's the killer? #YR #FreeSharon #Justice4Shar
Drinkki should divorce the heck out of Victurd. He is never even with her. He's too busy messing with people. #YR
The GCPD are pathetic as hell. They have no case against Sharon. #YR
Dickolas and Wtpos still have no chem. Awe. #YR
I can't even acknowledge Paige anymore. She's that irrelevant. I'm just gonna tweet WTPOS? = What's the point of Sage?
Lol Davery are awful. Kill it already. #YR
Aw look at Mariah/Noah being there for Sharon. At least they understand her disorder. #YR
"I will ask to go to the bathroom. They have windows in there. That's how I got out last time" LMAOO Queen Sharon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #ThugLife #YR
Is Paul the killer? lmao... I mean he's way too overly convinced that Sharon is the killer and there is like NO real evidence. #YR
Victor needs to be in jail. I mean FFS. Gaslighting, identity theft, kidnapping, extortion, perjury etc. List goes ON #YR
Light them ALL on fire, Queen Sharon. #YR
LMAO Victor's obsession with Sharon continues. I think he's deeply in love with her. I mean her presence always impacts him. #YR
The writers just needed Sharon to go the ugly dump underground so that people would care about it. Sharon stays propping Dickolas. Ugh #YR
"She's breaking the law" LMFAOO Victurd that is rich coming from you, you sick bastard. It's time Victor goes to jail. #YR
"I volunteer" STFU Abby ho skank boring man-stealing bitch. #YR
Of course Lord Voldemort has to call the police on Sharon. Go get a life &amp; stop obsessing over Jack/Sharon. Creep. #YR
Sharon may be a mess, but she is a flawless mess. Nobody can make an entrance better than her. Queen. #YR #Diva
Omg, the Sharon-Elizabeth parallels continue.... #GH #YR #Sharlizabeth #TheBussedandtheBeautiful 
@minniepearl74 Lmao ikr??
Aside from the fact that she talks about Jason 24/7, look at Sam. She is happy. Jake is happy with Liz. Everyone's happy. lol #GH
Lol Carly "Sonny hi. I'm on my way" ... Typical. #GH
OMG Sabrina went off the stage to go get Michael. MY HEART. #GH #Sakey
Omg :'( This song reminds me of last year. Poor Sabrina, she's been through so much. #GH
OMG YES Sabrina's voice &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #GH
I was just watching some #Days clips from 2005 and DAMN. Sami's apartment used to be like the size of the plastic town square now lol
Wait Nikolas, love you, but sit down. You are the one who told Liz the truth. Deal. #GH
I had a bruise worse than that when I was like 8 after falling down stairs. Spencer is so dramatic omg #GH
@beachbabymarie I was referring to Liz lol
WTF??? This is the alleged "disfigurement" Spencer has been moaning about? BYE FELICIA!  Sit down, stop talking &amp; get some counselling. #GH
Aw Carly approves of her future daughter-in-law. #GH
@Julie_Foxy @JTRules1 Ugh that's what I'm thinking now. Fuck. :( RIP Shylan hopes lol
Sam who? Whose pretty face was it that Jake memorized? Js... Lol #GH
"half this town lies and cheats" PREACH IT. And thanks for the Sabrina shoutout lol. Repping for the underdogs :') #GH
Ugh seriously Sloane and Jake? He needs to go be with his woman now. Ugh. Go away. #GH
Is Wally Kurth singing live? I feel like he's the only one who isn't using playback or being dubbed or whatever they do. Or am I wrong? #GH
I'm so cheap lol I just want at least 1 Liason sex scene and Liz to have a baby (girl). And no miscarriage or anything ugh  #GH
OMG Elizabeth PREACH IT #GH
"everyone likes Cameron better" yea there's a reason for that Spencer #GH
Aw "you're good enough to be apart of anyone's world", cute. Just not the world of the living. Jk #GH
This is some dark stuff with Liz...wow #GH
"Jason is dead now" girrllll. #GH
OMG Liz turning this into a full on speech. Queen of Improvisation right there. Slay #GH
Liz making me nervous stop it #GH
OMGGG the Jake/Liz flashbacks. Ermergerd. #GH
"I guess that makes me a townie too" Oh, speak the truth, Kayla or Kathy or whatever your name was. Lol jk #GH
Is Spencer a regular? I mean ... ugh... #GH
@RIGHTY777 Well I'm happy they're doing this at all. Altho it would have been cool if they did it all at once like a Netflix show type thing
@RIGHTY777 I've never been able to distinguish between Canadian/American accents. Like how some Americans can't with British/Australian.
@RIGHTY777 LOL you're welcome?
I still CANNOT @ Pratt thinking crazy Sharon is interesting

In Queen Sharon's words, "let me give you a clue".... RME #YR
@RIGHTY777 Really? I can't tell the difference lol I'm Australian
I kinda wish Bill Bell wrote Sharon as bipolar in the 90s. He was a genius &amp; would have done the story justice. Griffith was just NO #YR
It would take a miracle for me to want Shick again.
What Dickolas did in 2005/06 was gross but I can't support him ever again after the way he's emotionally abused Sharon. He is TRASH #YR
Sharon is the only character that I can root for on #YR. Literally the only one. The rest are hypocritical, ignorant rich snobs
@RIGHTY777 I was really sad when a lot of the voices changed after season 2 :/ I didn't notice it when I was a child tho
@RIGHTY777 lol I don't want to be mean but I don't like her version at all. It made season 3/4 unbearable
Dickolas has known Sharon for 21 years. Yet changing a paternity test makes her capable of murder? The fuck? HE needs help #YR
Even stuck-up bitches like Avery who are supposed to be well educated and logical can't even properly understand what mental illness is #YR
Basically, #YR's message is:
"Bipolar people are unfit parents"
"Being bipolar makes you capable of murder"

This is terrible...
@Sailor_Moon_CA @RIGHTY777 Oh the dub is Canadian? I had no idea :O Thanks
I'm ranting right now so please mute me if you want lol
If Sharon wasn't under house arrest &amp; accused of murder then I'd be fine with her acting a bit silly. But THIS shit? No. Ugh... #YR
I don't know what is worse - the fact that #YR's writing is degrading, offensive etc or the fact that it's just TERRIBLE.
Someone with BP should be given emotional support, not yelled at every day - no wonder Sharon is constantly going off the deep end FFS #YR
@louisey It's disrespectful &amp; offensive the way #YR write other characters around Sharon.
@RIGHTY777 lol which one? My fave Sailor Moon actor was Terri Hawkes. And Tracey Moore was good but short.
Sharon is not a serial killer. I swear to god, the way these people talk about her, they act like she's FRANCO or something. #YR #GH
Do the writers even at least seek out advice or speak to anyone who is bipolar? They have no idea how to write a sensitive story. #YR
@louisey Exactly! in the #GH custody case, the judge did not use Sonny's BP against him. #YR took Sharon's kid away bc she's bipolar. UGH
You can't say Victor has been ruined just as much as Sharon when Sharon has to be humiliated &amp; pay, while Victurd never pays. #YR
@RIGHTY777 Aw same. I would kill for the original American voice cast. A lot of them still sound the same lol
The "writers" at #YR should go watch Empire and take note of how bipolar disorder should be written. As something serious, not a joke. SMH.
@jamdownrocks SMH. That old man needs to go take a nap already ugh. This character is so played out. He should be killed off tbh
Lawd have mercy. #YR have Sharon going crazy again.  #Justice4Sharon
@jamdownrocks NO, let it out Cher! LOL
@jamdownrocks UGH what's with Paul's certainty that Sharon is guilty? like wtf? SO random. #YR
@RIGHTY777 yess I love it! The art is amazing and detailed. Although, it's hard with the subs. But yes still watching.
I just want Liz to be unapologetic about this. I don't want #GH to do her like #YR did Sharon last November ugh.
@xAyeJess @jamdownrocks they should start their own soap lol just the 3 of them being badass bitches &amp; never losing <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@rodrigo1993 Carly was caught so off guard <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Imagine if Jason found out the truth but decided to let Sam/Patrick be. Lol well I can dream <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> #GH
LMFAO when Brenda randomly started throwing bread at Carly's head <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #GH #NursesBall2013 
#SHYLAN hugs tho <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> #YR 
So Liz doesn't tell the truth? Well good. This storyline needs someone to do something already. Plus Jasam would bore me sorry<CONFUSED FACE> #GH
Queen Beryl was scary AF when I was a child. #SailorMoon
Watching Sailor Moon and crying over my childhood
omg Spencer... "you all think of me as a monster" is he serious? The dramaticness is on another level. #GH
@JParish90 Same. Trying to see the positives of the bussing LOL
@Ksweety26 just some bitter Shaters do
I just hope once this s/l wraps up and Jason goes back to Sam (ugh), Elizabeth doesn't just mope around and apologize 24/7 ugh #GH
@Ksweety26 I loved Delia, she should be alive, but LOL. That person is stupid. Sharon was created by Bill Bell. She is a legacy character
And I'm loving Liz getting this screentime. She was on like once a month in 2013 and it was torture ugh. #GH
This Liz thing is a double-edged sword. I'm glad she's apart of the conflict rather than just doing nothing. It's more interesting. #GH
@TeresaLuvz is legit. SO talented. Amazing voice and stage presence. #GH #TeamSabrina
Watched Sabrina's performance (featuring some back up singers) several times. She is such a talented Queen. #GH #Sakey
Is it awful that I wish Britt and Nathan slept together before they found out they were siblings LMAO. #GH
They should have never let DT go. He had good chemistry with MCE. Chelly would have been adorable, not a boring plot point. #YR
Remember when that dumbass person tweeted "Why kill off a legacy character like Delia? Why not kill off Sharon?" - I LOL'd. #YR

 
"babysitting Sharon" really, baker bitch? You are the one baby-sitting Joe who has professionals caring for him. Sharon has NO one. #YR
@JTRules1 awww&lt;33 Shylan. That was cute how he told her how to hold a cup. LOL
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you wanna be
My one &amp;only all my life
#Sakey #GH 
@WilsonSamie0050 but did u see the way she was acting? It was strange. If she was thinking right she wouldn't leave while under house arrest
@WilsonSamie0050 yea but are u sure these are the scenes she was teasing?
@WilsonSamie0050 why? I think it was obvious tbh. She was acting way too happy and then coming to the UG. Smh
LOL the way Carly was smiling when Jake said "There's this woman, and I like her..." you'd think he was talking about her. LMAO! #GH
Liz &amp; Nik's chemistry is still as strong as ever. I'm here for it in the end. #GH
Liz always has multiple male options but ends up alone UGH. It's so infuriating. #GH
@Amran2828 He went back to his wife Robin after she came back in 2013. Patrick / Sabrina lost a child last year :( I did love Patrina
@Amran2828 Patrick you mean?
Omg enough of this Spencer stuff. TOO far. Too far.... he could have actually hurt Emma/Cam. #GH
Ugh seriously Spencer? That was just mean mean mean (*Susan Banks voice*) #GH
Michael is mesmerized by his future wife&lt;3 Sabrina is a goddess #GH #Sakey 
Sabrina is such a low-key mastermind, the subliminal message &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #SabrinaQuartermaine #Sakey #GH
LOL this was funny #GH 
OMG yes Queen Sabrina is slaying this performance. She's so multi-talented. Nurse, child care professional, investigator, performer etc #GH
"You are not going to get away with this!" - seriously. They have got too far with Spencer. SMH #GH
LMAO Emma "You're still the same person" "That's the problem" preach it girl #GH
Ermergerd Nathan #GH
"what is she doing here?" shut up Dickolas. Be grateful that someone as flawless as Queen Sharon was bothered 2 come to this dump #YR
The repugnant rich assholes of Genoa City should take a second to at least research what bipolar is. They are such ignorant bitches. #YR
@jamdownrocks ikr? LOL. Did u see the way he was hugging her. omg haha
Paige, you tried. Queen Sharon shows up looking so much betta than yew. #YR
Queen Sharon is prob off her meds but meh, she looks STUNNING. #YR
Look at #YR needing Queen Sharon to make this dumbass underground re-opening relevant
Yea Dickolas wants what's best for Sharon, that's why he took away her child &amp; accuses her of being a murderer. He's so supportive #YR
omg did u guys see that Shoa hug? They have too much chemistry for a mother and son LOL. #YR
Sharon is being overly happy/optimistic :( Ugh she's so off her meds. #YR
Poor Faith. She has to settle for Dickolas as a parent until the Queen is freed. #YR
awww Abboring and Stitch sharing those smiles &amp; stares. Supercouple potential right there. #YR
lmaoo Kyle trying to act all tough in front of Victor. Bye #YR
Stitch and Abbitch are a terrible pairing. It's awful bc Stitch had potential. #YR
Abby is a slut. And she's the worst kind. #YR
lmaooo Princess Faith is asking Paige why she is there. #DEAD #YR
Princess Faith: "My mom bought it for me"
Paige: "She has really good tase"
Princess Faith: "I know"
#YR
Shut the hell up and go away Paige. No 1 curr about you. #YR
Princess Faith knows what's up. She shaded Betty Crocker's passive-aggressive behind &amp; now she's shading fake ass Paige. &lt;3 Proud of her #YR
OMG Faith is shading the ugly underground. This is why she's my 2nd fave Sharon child. #YR
The underground is still as ugly &amp; stupid as ever. Hideous. #YR
Pratt thinks Dummer/Abboring need to be used more, and that Sharon is better when she's crazy. He has no clue omg <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #YR
So Sharon purposely has to go to the ugly ass underground to get arrested? WHY?? Just extra humiliation. Smh #YR
@ILuvSoapyDrama @BigBBfan1 smh. If Sharon wasn't in Dickolas' orbit these days no one would care about him. And ew that club <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@WendyJRE OMG <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@Julie_Foxy @sharonlcase aw Sharon looks great in glasses. I wish SN wore glasses 
@sharonlcase on #ATWT aww so young 
Its time to end the flop that is Davery
-most viewers don't want them
-I don't want them
-Dylan doesn't want them

SHYLAN already plz. #YR

@Julie_Foxy DM
@BBohaty @WendyJRE wait why lol
@WendyJRE @BBohaty you should re watch the original anime so we can talk about it lol. It's the shit. 90s anime is life <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@WendyJRE @BBohaty OMGG I GOT THE SEPTOR <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Courtney won a fan favorite poll? What were the other options?  #GH 
@WendyJRE @BBohaty tbh I feel like I only got into the books around 2004. Everyone was reading it and I felt left out lmao<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WendyJRE @BBohaty did u watch Sailor Moon?
@WendyJRE @BBohaty OMG prisoner of Azkaban was my fav book and film when I was younger.  <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

Ew..... lol jk  
@WendyJRE me right now 
@WendyJRE my last DM tho <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> so off topic
@WendyJRE LMFAOO it just got serious and I'm catching SERIOUS feels <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
The 90s were the best <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> especially growing up around then. Lord.... nostalgia. Let m stop
@WendyJRE me when your DM about 1 song turned into a convo about nostalgia &amp; now I'm crying <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@Julie_Foxy no it was so right tho <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy Spencer seemed like a child again when he saw Britt. Too bad it disappeared ugh.
@Julie_Foxy keep going <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy and oddly I like Britt/Spencer. And Britt/Obrecht. Cute scenes
@Julie_Foxy the upside if/when Liz lies and everyone hates her, Niz can finally get together <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> he still loves her <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Julie_Foxy like nothing can make me hate Nikolas. I still ship the f*** out of them
@jamdownrocks yup. It's 5.40am and I have to leave at 7:30. FML. But this happens a lot. I sleep when I get home lol
@Julie_Foxy it's true tho. Her character had no other purpose apart from lying
@Julie_Foxy LMAO I cannot. Ugh. I have come to love SamTrick too. Whyyyy. This Jasam do nothing for me. Literally nothing
@Julie_Foxy your anti-Luckyism soothes my soul <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@Julie_Foxy OMG glad you still love Niz too
@Julie_Foxy Lmao. I love Britt but <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@jamdownrocks I ended up having another all nighter <WEARY FACE> the best I can do is a 1 hour nap. I'm a mess
@Julie_Foxy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WEARY FACE>
omg I should be sleeping
Faith is the best soap child. #YR 
@jamdownrocks I didn't know that she watched GH. Creep
Part of why I want Sharon/Dylan is so that we get more Sharon vs Nikki. Miss their catty scenes. The old days... #YR 
@jamdownrocks Smh. Sad
The Circle of Life just makes me want to cry. The nostalgia... I want to go back to my childhood, fuck this crap <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I miss Chloe. She was one of the only likable characters on #YR but they never gave EH a proper storyline ugh.
@BBohaty was it in the show room?
@BBohaty Yea but that was it? lol. Stephanie was shot after a fashion show, Thomas kissed Brooke, etc. They used to be dramatic
Melisandre: [stares at the camera like Jim on The Office] #GameofThrones
By Dickolas' logic, he must have been off his meds for 18 years because that's how long he lied. Bitch. #YR
All the best vintage #BoldandBeautiful characters in one pic. I love this. 
This was so sad :( #Tridge #BoldandBeautiful 
I want Rick and Amber back.&lt;3 #BoldandBeautiful 
@KiaDollyMolly Same. It's creepy
I wish there was a #SailorMoonCrystal dub w/ the same American voice actors who did the dub for season 1 &amp; 2 of the original. :(
OMG! This storyline :O I miss Amber sooo much! #BoldandBeautiful @adriennefrantz 
Omg! Hunter Tylo's beauty is mystical here. Vintage #BoldandBeautiful #PrincessLaila 
omg when Prince Omar showed up out of nowhere in 2005. That was creepy. #BoldandBeautiful #Classic
Ugh Rick and Ridge are always fighting but what about poor Thorne, the ACTUAL son of both Eric/Stephanie? #BoldandBeautiful
Happy Steffy and now Thomas is coming back. Would love to see Taylor, Thorne, Felicia etc make some appearances. #BoldandBeautiful
@KiaDollyMolly that's what I'm thinking
I don't watch #BoldandBeautiful full time but it seems like they never do dramatic fashion shows like they used to do a lot?
Everyone go report @/GHsHayDNikfans (is that Nycole?) they are sending actors abusive tweets.
Ridge finding the mannequin in Taylor's grave (which had no legs), that scene was creepy AF! #BoldandBeautiful 
@WendyJRE @BBohaty I agree
@BBohaty @WendyJRE I'm kind of over Arya tbh. I mean I'm still with her but I don't care about her as much as some others right now.
@2Mimi15 Lol. But it was silly of them to ask her if she'd be ok with ditching Donna. Donna is the one who brought her on...
@2Mimi15 Steffy is back and Thomas is coming back too so, they are on a good path.
@2Mimi15 true. I don't care about their location shoots. I just want my faves back: Taylor, Bridget, Amber etc.
@Sloantorres @BBohaty @BigBBfan1 IKR
@BBohaty she was unbearable when she and Bill took over FC in 09/10. So irritating. And she was such a dumb bitch when she shot herself lol
Hunter is adorable in that ballet outfit lol. And she is in great shape, wow. #QueensofDrama
@BBohaty I have never really liked Katie that much. I mean she's better than the other HOgans but she is annoying
"That's why none of you are married" omg.... #QueensofDrama
@WendyJRE @BBohaty doesn't she look like a Grecian goddess on the right? like wow. I hate her lol
@BBohaty @WendyJRE I thought it was just the lighting being different
@MedinaHauteur what about AH?<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@boogieXlove omg the square is hideous. I have always hated it. It's sp plastic
@boogieXlove The budget drop since 2012 have been tragic. Just sad to watch. Really hope we see more than quarter-sets lol
Obrecht's rendition of 99 Red Balloons is stuck in my head for some reason LMAO. #GH
@boogieXlove Honestly if this can't lift ratings then that will be tragic.
@boogieXlove Is this just a 'look back' sort of thing or is this like GH50 where they are gonna give us real plots? I hope so.
@boogieXlove the show should just be cancelled soon lol. It's not worth it :(
@boogieXlove She does look good. Still hate the character
@boogieXlove I honestly had to mute him sometimes last year. I could not. The way he was defending Abigail last year was grating to the soul
@boogieXlove from the bits here and there I see, I like Sonny and Paul. Will's character is just annoying. They've ruined him.
@boogieXlove I actually enjoyed them around that wedding time but they just got so tiring I couldn't be bothered. So boring
@boogieXlove I don't watch Days full time but when I do Will annoys the f*** out of me. Plus he needs a make over like seriously.
@boogieXlove I liked Chilly and some of Villy but they got so boring &amp; repetitive
@boogieXlove I find him monotone. But Chelly in general are just stupid. The writers have been doing him no favors
@boogieXlove oh *judging silently*
@boogieXlove I felt nothing but to each his own. All I saw was hypocritical Billy whining
@boogieXlove I never asked u but do u like Guy Wilson as Will?
@boogieXlove No. I can't. He feels like nothing to me lmao. He's not a bad actor but he's just NOT right for this role. Complete miscasting
"part of me will always be #TeamShick, but Nick is a big whore right now :)" - @BigBBfan1's bio. LOL. #YR
@BigBBfan1 omg this is such a significant moment in history
@BigBBfan1 I was hoping the same thing. If Paige gets pregnant, have it be Adam's but she can LIE to Dickolas. Douche deserves it lol #YR
@boogieXlove I loved his chemistry with MCE, they were so cute. I cannot with current Billy. Like...no.
@BigBBfan1 is giving me life again LOL
Omg guys you know shit just got REAL when @BigBBfan1 changes her icon for the first time in years lol. #Shylan
@boogieXlove Yea she's very content as Katie. lol Billy, what a mess
@boogieXlove Such a Queen. I'd kill to see her play Victoria again for a day. Like GH did with the Carlys.
@boogieXlove Iconic. Lol EB still mad about that
@boogieXlove she bores me. Maybe it's the writing for her character since her return. But HT's Victoria was everythinggg
lol remember when Brooke slapped Katie for sleeping with a relative's man? Like bitch really? #BoldandBeautiful
@Noby92 Nick and Katie were awful. They should have never happened. So pointless.
@boogieXlove I will never agree lol. Yes I've seen that. A lot of viewers are hating her for it. I wonder if that's the goal
@boogieXlove Katie is better than Donna/Brooke, but she's still annoying. She is nothing compared to Victoria (when HT played her).
@Noby92 What is Natie? Is that Nick and Katie or something else
@WendyJRE Yes I LOVE her. I think she is my 2nd fave tbh
Heather Tom is a legend, there are no words. But Katie Logan is so basic. I wish she played Felicia or Kristen sth. #BoldandBeautiful
My mouth waters at the thought of what Victoria would be like if Heather was playing her rn. :( Damn the good old days. #YR
Carly has always been so annoying &amp; nosy. Like that friend who sends u 1000 texts and you send them one message back lol. #GH
SMH when you have to turn off a fanvid bc the feels are too much LOL. Music makes everything so much more dramatic
Liason- say something 
@WendyJRE @BBohaty Yes I agree. But idk why, that blue outfit she wore in s3 is my all time fave. She looks so fierce
*waiting for @BigBBfan1 to correct the spelling error in her bio from ick to ylan*
@Julie_Foxy @crimson151 haha yes. I remember ranting and raving about Shylan so much on here but then the Chylan mess happened &amp; I gave up<UNAMUSED FACE>
@Julie_Foxy @crimson151 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ it's true
@Julie_Foxy ROTFL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy @crimson151 hope so bc we need you. You are like the president of Shylan <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy I see what you mean
@Julie_Foxy lol
@crimson151 @Julie_Foxy yup don't deactivate Julie<DISAPPOINTED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
@Julie_Foxy Lol that's so me with everything xD
@Julie_Foxy I'm gonna really miss your soap tweets :(
@BBohaty @WendyJRE two of my fave looks. Simple 
@Julie_Foxy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> he's so worthless
@jamdownrocks funny how they ship a pairing where the man is clearly manipulating the woman. They are so stupid <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy LOL <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@WendyJRE @BBohaty really? Mine was season 3 and some of 4
@jamdownrocks Lmao poor souls. No pairing with Betty has heat. And a lot of ppl just want Betty &amp; Joe to get together and leave the show <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
&lt;3 #Sakey #GH 
Ugh now I feel like, Shylan's kiss will be a daydream or something. SIGH. @Julie_Foxy what do u think?
@soapoperanurse3 Yes I'm so excited omg
Does Sharon go free next week? Don't wanna get my hopes up, but why else would she be kissing Dylan? And she looked like she was @ the UG
@ynnej2198 IKR? It's so her colour
I kinda wish Britt would have tried to sneak in &amp; and see BEN wherever he was. Instead of Spencer. Ugh. #GH
@jamdownrocks @BigBBfan1 they are all so bitter &amp; jealous of how popular Shylan are, despite not even being a couple. Such overcompensation
@TeamMaya14 @TeamLopeOnBB @BBohaty @Julie_Foxy Love it
OMG such perfection <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Best looking couple on the carpet tbh. #GH #Sakey 
@5lu7cy18 I wonder if her "death" was so that she can make a big return for the 50th anniversary. I hope so.
Stefano better work some Helena Cassadine-type shit and bring back all of his family. #Days
Poor Stefano :( #Days
@Julie_Foxy DM
I would rather Liason have gotten together and then into their relationship he remembers or she figures it out. Not like this. Ugh. #GH
Ugh let me guess Liz will hide the truth, it will come out soon, everyone will be hating on her. Sigh -___- #GH
Liason :( #GH
UGH NOOOOOOOO. Nikolas grrrr.... You choose NOW? Lol #GH
ughhh Nikolas NOOO STOPPPPP don't do that #GH
Aw Hayden is free to thirst out in the open now. Lol. #GH
@minniepearl74 Lol right? :/
@minniepearl74 Lol. Michael and Kiki were awful
Is Spencer supposed to be a Cinderella-type character here? Is Britt his fairy-godmother??  #GH
I do feel bad for Ric. :( He just wanted to be with the Queen so badly :( #GH
The slide show was a nice touch Carly. #GH
OMG CARLY #GH
Aw Spencer seems like a child again around Britt. #GH
The audience is just pressed @ Obrecht's showmanship &amp; talent tbh. #GH

Wait, is that Sabrina? is she back at GH? #GH
Ok I have actually been loving Carly these last few episodes. #GH
Ugh Molly and TJ act like 25 year olds. It irks me. #GH
LOL how much was that reporter person paid to call Spencer "delightful" ? #GH
Poor Maxie but lmaoo Brad and Britt give me life. #GH
OMG Maxie looks gorgeous. &lt;3 #GH
Ugh Molly and TJ annoy me lol. #GH
OMGG YESSS SAKEY are the stunning couple I knew they would be. :') Flawless. #GH #Sakey
Elizabeth kind of reminds me of J.Lo in that gown in Maid in Manhattan. She looks like royalty.  #GH
Spencer did NOT just say "what the fudge". 
That was such a try-hard version of Emma saying "Witch please" a couple years ago. Smh #GH
Yesss Queen Elizabeth looks AMAZING! #GH
Damn Valerie looks good. #GH
ugh I was hoping Spencer wasn't in this episode. SIGH. Long sigh. #GH
OMG Britt thought Olivia was fat #GH
Lol the nurses ball red carpet 'arrivals' make me cringe sometimes. I mean they are addressing people who aren't even relevant xD #GH
@Julie_Foxy I was so tired coming home &amp; then I saw a tweet saying "finally Shylan" or something lol and I was like<FLUSHED FACE> 
@Julie_Foxy OMG I cannot <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> I thought it wouldn't happen or we would have had to wait months. I was not prepared LOL

@boogieXlove Lol ikr? Even when I was still watching in 2012/13 there was rarely mention of Jack. And I miss Nick/Bridget etc
@boogieXlove lol the B&amp;B and Y&amp;R timelines in particular give me a headache
@boogieXlove Wait I heard they were casting a SORASed RJ? Or did I read wrong
@boogieXlove I don't watch. Is Caroline still with Ridge?
@boogieXlove Thomas is supposed to be a couple years older
@boogieXlove I can see that. Altho he's really young looking.
@boogieXlove is it just me or does Steffy seem like the older sibling? I mean Thomas has been a whimp to me
@boogieXlove I just googled. Is he hispanic?
@boogieXlove Hope they go for someone a bit older. JMW looked older than AG
@boogieXlove who's he?
@boogieXlove I haven't really liked either Thomas actor. I hope they cast someone good.
@boogieXlove  That's good news, the char should be on. I wonder why Adam Gregory isn't returning tho
@WendyJRE lmaoo it's so funny. omg this was awful 
What It’s Like To Not Watch 'Game Of Thrones' 
@boogiexlove DM
Britt being close with Obrecht and bonding with Faison, it gives me so many feels lol. Who would have thought? Love their whacky fam. #GH
Obrecht gives birth to really good looking kids. #GH
Spencer doesn't want to go to the ball. GOOD, we don't want you there. Lol. #GH
Aww Britta &amp; Mutta together again&lt;3 I've missed them. #GH
seriously? Spencer takes long to get ready. Lol. Why? #GH
I dislike Spencer although I do enjoy him &amp; Britt. #GH
Ugh Spencer has the nerve to break into his father's safe, ask his father questions...like, go to your damn room you little jerk. #GH
LOL Hayden is like "WTF" while meeting Spencer. #GH
Aww Britt and Faison are bonding? That's cute. #GH
YAY! Britt :))) I've missed her!! Aww @ Brad and Britt's reunion. I love them. #GH
Lmao at Betty Crocker's face when Queen Sharon answered Dylan's phone. #YR
Poor Stefano. He's lost like 6 children :( all he has is stupid Chad. I want to give him a hug tbh. #Days
So Jack, EJ, possibly Kristen... Etc are dead. And we are stuck with characters like Daniel.. Eve.. Abigail? Bye. #Days
How could Dickolas want to split this up? I mean....is he even human. #YR #Shaith 
Ugh not only is TRASH existing, now he's stopping these cute Maxlor moments. Please die. #FindingCarter
Lol "what number am I thinking of" "17" "46" they are adorable. #FindingCarter
I don't know who is faker. David or Trash. #FindingCarter
Gross. I hate the fact that Trash is even in the vicinity of Carter etc. #FindingCarter
Ugh enough of Ofe and Taylor. If anything she should be with Gabe while not with Max. Ofe is not worthy. He's just...ueghno. #FindingCarter
Oh. Trash's uncle is hot. #FindingCarter
Ew. I'm so sick of Trash. SMH Carter. #FindingCarter
Omg is that Britt? I hope so. I've missed @kellythiebaud #GH
Liz just looks so bored with Ric. Ugh :/ #GH
Lol Hayden just comes out of nowhere. #GH
Ugh Spencer will be at the ball. *Long sigh* #GH
SO happy that Genie is coming back. Even if its not for long, I love seeing her. I've missed her on soaps. #GH
Pete or whatever his name is, is kinda hot. #GH
The ball room should be bigger #GH
Remember when Sam tripped on the red carpet and Britt/Brad were laughing at the TV? I died...lmao. #GH
I loved Brad and Britt laughing during last year's nurses ball. LOL. #GH
#Days really need to fix their lighting. Those scenes in front of green walls that are supposed to look like they are outside suck lol
Molly irritates me. Idk why. She just does. #GH
Ugh no part of me is here for Jasam right now. Not just bc of Liason, but I've actually come to love Samtrick. :/ #GH
A gift to my folllowers: htt…
#No1Curr  

YES!! The QUEEN is such a good mom! Nick YO…
Paige already kissing Adam. Skank. #YR
Lol they actually showing Betty and Joe at that clinic? RME. That should be like the rest of their history - offscreen. #YR
@jamdownrocks Lol idk. If she isn't Sandy then she is pointless
Victoria is such a bitch #YR
First Dickolas gave her alcohol while underage, then he snaps her neck, now he dumped her. Poor Sandy!! #YR
Dead @ Dickolas dumping Paige already. Bye Felicia! #YR
Shylan look so good together <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> #YR 
Ugh Dickolas. I really can't stand you <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> #YR
Sharon just proved that she puts Faith first. Dickolas on the other hand just uses Faith to punish Sharon. He sucks. #YR
Ew so Queen Sharon is defending Dickolas? Fuck that shit. #YR
Lmao Dickolas trying to act like he isn't a violent cave man. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
Omg LOL Paige is so fake. The way she is with Adam and then others. It's like a different personality. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
So that trashy "night club" is being reopened. That's so stupid. #YR
@MarlandRulez oh god yes.
Dickolas doesn't even care about Faith lol he acts like someone stole his laptop or something <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> one screwing of Paige &amp; he'll forget. #YR
Shut the hell up Dickolas you hypocritical piece of worthless white trash. You deserve this. #YR
Dickolas you are a piece of shit. Just stop talking. #YR
Paige/Sandy is the fakest person on earth. We know Dickolas broke your neck but what is your point?? #YR
Lord Voldemort just needs to take a damn nap or something. He just gets more and more evil. #YR
I feel terrible for Ashley. She deserves a better child than skank Abbitch. #YR
Oh my god Abboring and Stitch are disgusting <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> #YR
Ew. Sandy/Paige follows Dickolas around everywhere like a bad smell. Involving herself in personal matters. Desperate much? #YR
"Both of you just shut up" Dante speaking for all of us lol #GH
Aw Sabrina nursing again. #GH
“@MimiC1019: "He can wait a little bit" YOOOOO Sonny gives zero fucks about Morgan. I can't. #GH”lmaoo
So Sonny is taking AJ away?  Sigh. He's so selfish. #GH
LMFAO @ the unemployed loser criminals. They truly are juvenile delinquents. #GH 
Omg Morgan is such a joke lmao. #GH
Yesss Dante you better read your punk delinquent brother for filth! #GH
OMG NED -___- #GH
@xAyeJess IKR?
"I need you to hide the baby" wtf? Sonny stays awful. #GH
Nina and Franco on again. Why? #GH
Imagine the cute babies Sakey will have tho :') Lol. I can just see it #GH
Ermergerrd they kissed again *dead* #GH #Sakey 
We feel your pain Theresa. :( Melanie's presence tends to be draining. #Days 
Isn't Will the one who cheated on Sonny? The hell. This bitch... he has some nerve #Days
omg they are making Kristen so crazy in this scene. I still love Bristen. #Days
omg Melanie is so annoying STFU bitch. #Days
Is Will seriously reading a text he is sending out loud? lol #Days
Will is awful. Ugh. #Days
The old Chad was way better. #Days
I wish #Days would let Kristen win for once
I really wish the writers would make Sharon a jewelry designer and use SC's pieces in the storyline. That would be so cool. #YR
SMH. Nick was so supportive of Sharon during the Cameron Kirsten thing. What happened to that Nick? Sigh #YR
@angstwhore59 @sharonlcase Ikr? Flawless
@sharonlcase gorgeous. I love your hair like this. #YR 
Sharon's hair and top in those Shylan scenes reminded me of these scenes from June 2004. #YR @sharonlcase 
@zachriaul this morning
@zachriaul I did
#teamsharon @sharonlcase  
Queen Sharon is getting huge love on social media right now while others are widely hated... <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR #youtried 
#YR have the same problem as #Days. They are very out of touch with most of what viewers are saying.
@zachriaul I made that

Dante for the win!!!  #GH

Sharon and Dylan would be the perfect couple. They are so real with eachother and equally supportive of one another. #YR #Shylan
Sorry #YR - but you failed miserably.

Viewers hate Nick/Summer and support Sharon. Because Sharon is QUEEN. #StayMad 
Pratt also needs to see how well viewers respond when Sharon stands up for herself. "Crazy" is not interesting anymore. Wake. Up. #YR
Pratt thinks Summer/Abby need to be used more - sorry, viewers can't stand them. We love Mariah and CG, though. TPTB need to WAKE UP. #YR
Even when Mariah was being awful to Sharon, CG was so convincing &amp; I rooted for Mariah. Summer = 50 shades of whining and screeching. #YR
I'm glad, judging from Facebook, that I'm not the only one who thinks Camryn was not only robbed of an Emmy nomination, but win. #YR
DAMN. Facebook are going IN on her. It's clear nobody cares about Dummer. We'd rather see Mariah, because Camryn rocks. #YR
More after the click -&gt; 
@2Mimi15 B&amp;B is still visually the best soap. I don't like the characters left, but the other soaps look very cheap compared to it.
How dare Melanie even talk to Queen Kristen. Who does she think she is? #Days
SMH. I was hoping Kristen could keep the baby. Now they have this bitch Melanie finding him? Terrible writing as always. #Days
"are you doing drugs?" lmao Queen Kristen. #Days
Sorry but #Days and #YR winning was... no comment. #BoldandBeautiful and #GH are much better in quality than those MESSES.
@Julie_Foxy DM
@WilsonSamie0050 IKR?
@Julie_Foxy They had this awkward moment where it seemed like they were flirting with eachother. It was so cute.
I miss Britt. I kinda want her to come back and snatch BEN back. #GH
@Julie_Foxy omg the April 28 Shylan scenes are everything!
Yess omg that was a REAL kiss, I loved it :') #GH #Sakey
Oh my god shut up Morgan. #GH
LMAO Carly hitting Morgan's arm. #GH
Lmfaoo Morgan and Kiki look so guilty omg I love it. #GH
YES Carly get him! #GH
Yesss Sabrina, drag those delinquents, stand by your future man. &lt;3 #GH
Valerie stop talking about Dante lol #GH
OH. Nina is on. Lol. #GH
@TeresaLuvz is flawless.&lt;3 #GH 
DG and SC always look good together when they take pics. I would ship Shane too, tbh. Lol.  #YR
OMG.... Imagine #Shrady. I would cross-soap ship that. #Days #YR 
LOVE Sakey. Thank you @carlivatiron for all the Michael/Sabrina! They are great together. #GH
YAS SABRINA, comfort your MAN! Omg. :') #GH #Sakey 
Sabrina delivers shade in such a subtle and classy way. I love her. #GH
OMGGGG MICHAEL AND SABRINA KISS?!!! ERRRMERRGERRDD guys. Fangirling. Haven't even watched it yet. #GH #Sakey
Sharon proved in her scenes with Faith why she's the better parent. I've never seen Dickolas explain something to so well to her. #YR
I LIVE for Michael Quartermaine right now. He is everything. #GH
omg Morgan you ARE a screw up. Juvenile delinquent. Trash. #GH
I love Sabrina just watching &amp; judging this situation. LOL. #GH
LMFAOO Morgan. What a joke. #GH
Morgan is such a little bitch. He's been found out and he's still lying. What a pitiful coward. #GH
@11tomica DM :)
@BBohaty DM
Guys, vote for Shylan! Only 4 couples get through to the next round. 
More #Shylan please.
Sandy/Paige is being so fake with Dickolas. And that smile to Victoria? She is such a fake person tbh. #YR
@jamdownrocks @Janeb_Soapfan Ugh. Victoria ??
@soapoperanurse3 same. Ugh. They need to fix Dickolas and even then it will take me a while to not hate him
@zachriaul why
@jamdownrocks Rotfl @ Faith saying she is scared Dick will hurt her. He's such a Neanderthal. Yet she feels safe with Shar.
When will TPTB understand: NO ONE cares about Dickolas &amp; Paige, unless she is Sandy wanting revenge. #YR
Nicholas Newman lover and fighter? Lol please. More like Dickolas Newman: fucker and whiner. #YR
@jamdownrocks yes lmao <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> hilarious
Awww Sandy/Paige is comforting Dickolas. So sweet. Their chemistry is electric. Jk #YR
OMG Shylan just had a near "moment". Let me rewind that. <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> their chemistry is amazing. #YR
LOL awww at Sharon telling Dylan Faith's lame but cute jokes. I can just imagine adorable Faith saying them. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️#YR #Shylan
Ashley &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Victoria
Which is weird bc as a child Victoria was one of my favs and I didn't really care for Ashley. #YR
These scenes remind us that Sharon has been there for Dylan too. They listen to each other. #YR #Shylan
@JTRules1 @1SteveBurton @sharonlcase YESS <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> another hug. #Shylan
Dylan and Sharon both have such a calming effect on each other. Their D&amp;Ms are everything. I love that. #YR
Yess #Shane <SMIRKING FACE>  
Seriously? They're bringing up Betty's offscreen miscarriage again? No 1 cares. Dylan, why not make a new one with Sharon lol #ANGTFT #YR
If this convo between Shylan isn't hinting at their future baby-making love sessions then IDGAF about Davery's offscreen history. #YR
My girl Shar is so sweet, she's pretending to care about Dylan &amp; Betty's tedious offscreen history. <CROWN> true Queen. #YR
Dylan to Sharon: "I think I told you about Arra (or whatever) before I told Avery" 
<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> #Shylan #YR 
I miss Thorne and Taylor. #BoldandBeautiful 
A comedy sounds like the most interesting thing. #QueensofDrama
I think this show is too dramatic for sensitive me lol #QueensofDrama
Hunter clearly meant the daytime soap opera is dying. Not the soap format. RME... #QueensofDrama
"Did she just insult us" um no?? #QueensofDrama
Vanessa is being really defensive. #QueensofDrama
Hunter&lt;33 I didn't know she was a writer. #QueensofDrama
"I'm not familiar with those girls" LMAO&lt;3 #QueensofDrama
omg Donna Mills is such a legit Queen. #QueensofDrama
I don't know who Crystal Hunt is. Altho I remember seeing her in that Sydney White movie. #QueensofDrama
Loved @AbsoluteHunter's hair flip
@soapoperanurse3 The way Noah just sat there while Dickolas was implying Sharon is capable of murder, it made me sick. Ugh. Smh. Faith &gt;&gt;&gt;
@soapoperanurse3 *my fiance, I wouldn't sit there &amp; let my other parent treat them like a murderer. Esp bc Sharon is a good person
@soapoperanurse3 He does support her, he's just sooo easily swayed and its so contrived to watch. If my parent was accused of killing*
@soapoperanurse3 well nah I still loved Noah as a child. He just annoys me. He's so easily influenced by Dickolas &amp; Victurd. Ugh.
I still miss brunette Sharon! #YR 
@soapoperanurse3 for me it's:
1. Cassie
2. Faith
3. Mariah
4. The daughter Sharon lost
5. Noah
Lol
@5lu7cy18 GH is the only soap I can watch even with its issues. The other soaps are such let downs. Yup.
Did anyone watch Queens of Drama? Is it any good?
#Days winning is a joke, sorry. I used to love this show, but lets be honest. It's cheap, the characters are weak, the storylines are boring
#GoTSeason5 Episode 2, #HighSparrow starts now.

I hate being this honest BUT CG worked her ass of as Mariah; she put 100% into the character. All a certain someone did was whine. #YR
Lol. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> whining and screeching is Emmy standard acting now apparently  
We ALL know DAMN well who should have won in this younger actress category. Mess. #QueenCamryn #DaytimeEmmys 
AH winning over Finola? Lol. Mess. All Finola needed to do was submit a reel of her standing there &amp; she should have won. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #DayrimeEmmys
And I heard that DAYS won an award for SET DESIGN? The fuck? Their sets are tragic and cheap. Simply tragic. #DaytimeEmmys
The #DaytimeEmmy noms and wins are a mess, sorry. Still disgraced at the fact that Camryn was not nominated and *others* were. <PENSIVE FACE> Sad!!
@Julie_Foxy aww<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@WilsonSamie0050 ugh he's such an arrogant bastard. Is he forgetting who started this paternity mess? He never takes responsibility.
Dickolas STFU. Your whiny bitch of a daughter Dummer is no angel and she deserved what she got. It was only ONE year. Lol. #YR
literally rolling on the damn floor @ Dickolas getting Faith taken away from him. Good riddance. He's a prick. Never is even with Faith. #YR
Once this mess is over, Queen Sharon should tie Dickolas to a chair and make him eat crow. Like ugh I can't stand him. #YR
Dylan defending Sharon&lt;33 #YR
Dickolas takes no responsibility. All he does is blame Sharon. What a little bitch he is. #YR
"You are the love of my life" Lol...oh please. Dylan and Avery would leave eachother at the first sight of trouble. They are weak. #YR
Bringing Patty Williams to GC, using Mariah to gaslight Sharon, and now this. Victurd is an evil person &amp; he NEVER pays for it. #YR
Nick is unbearable to watch right now. His hate of Sharon is SO over the top. #YR
Dylan &amp; Betty being BORING as hell. Break up already lol #YR
@Julie_Foxy I love that! She looks so good in a hat
SHUT UP DICKOLAS.
Shut up. Just shut up. 
Literally, stop talking. Now. You are annoying me. #YR
Aww Princess Faith believes Sharon yess stan for your mother. I knew you were always my 2nd fave Shick child, Faith.&lt;3 #YR
Queen Sharon is good with handling Faith. Dickolas treats her like an object to be fought over. #YR
Dickolas has known Sharon for 21 years. He knows damn well she isn't capable of murder. They have destroyed his character tbh. #YR
ugh Faith and Sharon are breaking my heart. #YR
"I want to see mommy" Princess Faith&lt;/3 #YR
Dickolas is so DUMB for believing the "evidence" it's clearly someone framing her. Why am I shocked? He's always been stupid as hell. #YR
"You're being punished for Sharon's crime" "the evidence" shut the actual f*** up Dickolas, you disgusting piece of TRASH. #YR
Vote for Shylan and SC guys...#YR 
The fact that Jack/EJ are dead while boring ass Daniel and Rafe are alive.... smh. #Days
Lmao I hope Morgan gets his ass kicked by Carly. #GH
Kiki's logic: hate on Sabrina for trying to put Ava into early labor; like Julian/Sonny who have both tried to kill Ava. Ok... #GH
Sakey are fire&lt;3 Their love scenes will be hot. #GH
Yess Queen Sabrina walks in with the receipts. #GH 
@minniepearl74 lol
Sonny is so distraught. Yet he has time to visit Luke at the hospital, go to ELQ etc... #GH
I hate Spinelli's hair like this... No....  #GH 4/23
lolol Morgan and Kiki yelling at eachother? That's so redundant. #GH
SMH what you doin Carrrrrlos. #GH
Morgan/Kiki just STFU. It's all your fault. #GH
Oh shit Morgan and Kiki are in this episode -___- #GH 4/23
@BBohaty DM
The other soaps look sooo cheap compared to #BoldandBeautiful
I love Jordan. #GH
Billy looks good in that jumper. #GH
@WendyJRE he was definitely naive, not bc he was stupid - he is a genius - but he had too much trust in mankind :(
@WendyJRE He did not need press or anything, he shouldn't have done interviews. Like Beyoncé doesn't do interviews, she can still sell.
@WendyJRE I love him but he was TOO good. He was too naive to even sit in interviews with those media attention seekers for many years
@WendyJRE Oprah is the best. She asks tough questions but she's still respectful, warm &amp; inviting. She was great with Michael, Rihanna etc.
@WendyJRE I can't with her either. She's so freakin condescending.
@WendyJRE check your DMs lol
@WendyJRE Right? Ugh. But she was good with Bruce tbh. I wish she gave Michael respect like that.
Wow that Kris Humphries, what a neanderthal jerk. I mean I don't even like the Kardashians but attention seeking much?
@WendyJRE I don't mind when interviewers ask personal questions in a special, but they should be respectful &amp; not judge. Bitches.
@WendyJRE And Barbara Walters ugh she was an annoying bitch during her interview with Michael too.
#Shylan are slaying polls right now and they are not even a couple. @ChuckPrattJr better give them a love story. #YR
@WendyJRE *clearly was pushing her own agenda. And she was SO judgmental &amp; rued with Britney. Ugh....
@WendyJRE I mean I get it, interviewers have to ask tough questions, but then the way she brought up Michael in other interviews. She*
@WendyJRE Ugh she just irks me. And she was judging Britney so hard for loving Michael. Like bitch GTFO with your agenda.
YESSS, BITCHES! The QUEENS at #1 and #2. Perfect. #YR #GH 
@sarah_sr166 So? She was with them when they were available and built honest relationships with each. Brooke steals everyone.
Taylor to Brookewhore '13: "You have more marriages than you have fingers for rings" Lol. #BoldandBeautiful
Ugh, Diane Sawyer annoys me. I still dislike her for her interviews with Michael and Britney.
so Bruce is actually transitioning? It's confirmed?
I just LOVE this dress @sharonlcase was wearing in an episode from 2011. Its one of my faves. #YR 
@BigBBfan1 lol wtf? All that account does is post pics of Betty. They posted like 190 pics of the night she received her dumbass award
Nicole is stunning. Her s/l still sucks. :( #Days
@ShylanNation @Julie_Foxy @WeeklyCountdown Is this for all of daytime? Bc if they are winning over all etc then clearly no 1 votes lol xD
SMDH at Nicole still not having a child...Sigh :( #Days
Is this DiscountEJ supposed to be an English/Australian mix? LOL. Like this accent is awful tbh. #Days
Smh how dare Brady play with my Kristen :( Giving her all this false hope. #Days
@ILuvSoapyDrama there is no way Days will stick around with ratings like it has been. I'm just assuming it will have one year at best.
Sorry, but the younger actress noms are a mess. A MESS. How the fuck is Camryn not there? This is clearly not based on TALENT. #DaytimeEmmys
#Days only getting 2.15 million viewers tho - TRAGIC. The worst part is, I think it could be saved if not for the boring characters/writing.
It's surreal that there will only be 3 daytime soaps left soon :O wow
@Julie_Foxy @ShylanNation @WeeklyCountdown Lmao same. It's a pretty irrelevant poll if Detty are #1.
Wtf is this set Kristen is in? It looks like some type of ancient church 0_o... #Days
Lmao Melanie. What a dumb bitch. #Days
Um do people actually like this DiscountEJ person? #Days
Lmaoo at Paige's acting..xD #Days
@jamdownrocks lololol
@jamdownrocks Dying over here LOL. KARMA
LMFAOOOOOO
So Dickolas has Faith taken away from him?? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR 
Heaps of people - even those who don't like either character - were enjoying Shick last year. #YR really know how to mess up a good thing.
@Julie_Foxy DM
The fact that we haven't seen one Shariah scene at all since Sharon was arrested is just... SMH. Where tf is Mariah? #YR
@jamdownrocks &lt;/3
This piece of trash Avery tho...she's supposed to be a champion for the innocent yet she wants Sharon to be in jail. Worthless bitch. #YR
QUEEN Sharon Collins Newman on her throne <CROWN><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 

keep slaying those basic bitches. #YR #TheyTried 
Sharon:
Took her 15 years to sleep w/ brothers.
Betty:
2 years.
Paige:
6 months.

Just saying. If Sharon is a ho, so are they. #YR
OMG those pics of JH. *fanning self* #YR
Haha. Betty came into Sharon's home, tried to insult her, but the Queen ended up owning her irrelevant ass. All she did was screech. #YR
Does Paige sleep with Adam? #YR

Sharon going …
@minniepearl74 yes ugh it was awful. She's doomed <WEARY FACE>
Will is so unlikable #Days
Melanie is so basic. The fact that she's even involved in a storyline that has Kristen in it, is a disgrace. Just like Daniel ugh  #Days
#Days seems like a web series with a good budget, not a television series airing on a major network. Sigh
Watching #Days for Queen Kristen and...ugh this show really does suck
Betty: "Go ahead violate your parole, assault me"
Queen Sharon: "I wouldn't even get my hands dirty on you" LOL. #YR
@Julie_Foxy @ILuvSoapyDrama <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@Julie_Foxy "Who are you? Mind your business." Lmao....
@teeveejeff LOL yes
@Julie_Foxy @ILuvSoapyDrama LOL
Davery are so over. Even if they stay together, the hype is with Shylan not them <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR 
Avery encountered Sharon when she was off her meds and now this self-righteous piece of trash thinks she KNOWS Sharon? GTFO bitch. #YR
Sharon has survived car accidents, a plane crash,rape,kidnapping, kids dying etc WTF has Betty done on her 3 seconds on the show? #YR
"Do I have dollar bills hanging from my G-string?" LMAO Drunk Sharon dissing Nikki. @sharonlcase was hilarious. #YR 
@jamdownrocks YUP
@jamdownrocks @heatherfree55 lol
@SkyLizzels @BigBBfan1 I died lol she's such a basic bitch
@BigBBfan1 @jamdownrocks @ILuvSoapyDrama @Julie_Foxy lolol what a stupid bitch
LMFAO @BigBBfan1: the iconic moment when dumbass Betty slammed a swinging door in Sharon's face. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FLUSHED FACE> #Fail #YR 
@Julie_Foxy Yea I hate when ppl act like it's forbidden or something. It just makes people want to see it more
That psycho Phick fan Jessica is still hating on SC? Wow. Some ppl need to draw the line. #YR
@Julie_Foxy 15? That's a decent age. Some kids who are like 12 watch worse lol
@Julie_Foxy I get so weird when watching her interviews. She's so good at putting on the American accent
@Julie_Foxy I don't mind. I mean I watch Game of Thrones and thats the worst
@Julie_Foxy Well if you say so, I might give it a go
@Julie_Foxy Has she cut her hair for season 2 of Finding Carter? I think it was longer before. I love her hair right now.
@Julie_Foxy Like I was loving Carter when she was all "my family" and angry at Trash/Lori but now she's getting pulled in by both again. Ffs
@Julie_Foxy I never watched Skins. Is it good?
@Julie_Foxy Which is stupid as hell bc she's beautiful for a woman in her late 40s. Smh.
@Julie_Foxy Carter annoys the hell out of me lol. Like, there were moments after Trash left in season 1...but now again?
I think "Victor" always winning goes further than the writers table. #imo  
@Julie_Foxy haha I know right. Glad CW left awful Y&amp;R. All the unnecessary and immature hate from those Villy fans was stupid.
@Julie_Foxy Like have we found out who Lori was talking to on the phone yet? Or did I miss something
@Julie_Foxy I love Elizabeth. my 2nd fave character after Taylor. And I feel like David is still hiding stuff.
@MarlandRulez I've never seen Melrose Place. Why was it really tacky  or something?
@Julie_Foxy Lmaoo Ikr?! But tbh I hate David.
@Julie_Foxy Yea ugh... Tbh I still kind of wish if she was gonna hook up with someone it would be Gabe. Not basic Ofe. Ugh
@Julie_Foxy Side note; I loved those scenes with Grant and Gabe in the closet. He was so caring for Grant. It was cute.
@Julie_Foxy I hate her. Like Carter and Taylor should have double twin slapped the crap out of her after what she did
@Julie_Foxy Carter friendzones him so much :(
@Julie_Foxy After the 1st few eps I kind of wanted Gabe and Max to fight over Taylor. Like, she deserves the attention lol
YESSS I love that Queen Sharon isn't taking crap from these bullies. #YR #TeamSharon 
@Julie_Foxy Aw I love this&lt;3
@Julie_Foxy Idk why but I feel like Bird is so unintentionally condescending towards Taylor
@Julie_Foxy LMAO perfect description. Like, it was gross
@Julie_Foxy Lol yes. Every time Carter walks into the room, Gabe always lights up. It's cute. She needs to go be normal with him. Trash..ew
@Julie_Foxy I kind of wish it was Elizabeth that Crash shot before I saw that episode. Is that weird?
@Julie_Foxy I didn't watch it until a couple of weeks ago lol, I love it. I binged the entire 1st season+se2 premiere in like a day
@Julie_Foxy She's my fave. And yes lol. Ofe is blah
@Julie_Foxy Ikr? I find Gabe so cute. I thought he would be more of a focus.... I mean why is Ofe getting more story? Like...no
@Julie_Foxy Friendship is not worth forgiving someone for framing you for grand larceny &amp; that hideous artwork thing. Bird is awful.
@Julie_Foxy I don't find him attractive at ALL. If Tay is gonna kiss someone at least make it Gabe. I find him cute tbh
@Julie_Foxy I would like to see Taylor dragging that bitch over Max, that would be cute lol
@Julie_Foxy I also can't stand Bird. She needs to leave the show. I hate how Carter continues forgiving her trifling behind
@Julie_Foxy I would hate someone if they shot me. Lol. But that's who Max is so yea. Forgiveness, yes. But working with Trash? no
@Julie_Foxy Yea ew that was gross but I guess its all just Maxlor angst
@Julie_Foxy I know he is so useless
@Julie_Foxy I love Max. But I fully get where Taylor is coming from. I would be annoyed as well
@Julie_Foxy I am angry at Max, I so agree with Taylor. I mean forgive Trash, but don't be all friendly with that jerk
@Julie_Foxy really? I'm so Team Taylor. I can't stand Bird. And I hate everyone basically forgiving Trash for nearly killing Max.
Betty is a great example of how people with their own agendas shouldn't work for the law. #YR
Davery suck &amp; have never had chemistry. They better give us Shylan already. Dylan is boring unless he's in scenes with Sharon or Faith. #YR
ROTFL at Betty screeching "assault me" "violate your bail" - yea she really is a superhero for the innocent. LMAO! #YR
Don't worry Michael - we all fall asleep during Avery's scenes. Nothing to be ashamed of. #YR
Betty is one to talk. She hopped from Dickolas to Dylan in a heartbeat and now she's emotionally involved with her ex. Slut. #YR
Canadian Spoilers: Michael falls asleep due to hearing Avery's voice. Bitch really is the cure to insomnia. #YR 
Queen Sharon really should have taken care of that cupcake bitch on the spot. Michael came in and ruined everything. #YR
Betty is an unlikable bitch. Even children don't like her. That speaks volumes. #YR
Betty, sit the fuck down. Sharon has been single for over 6 months. Your argument is so weak. #YR
Lol Sharon walked towards Betty and Betty was backing up. What a weak joke. #YR
Lmao Betty is such a joke. Sharon was Dylan's friend before he was Dickolas' brother. Sit your hypocritical ass down you stupid ho. #YR
"You are the love of my life" OMG.&lt;/3 #Hevon #YR
"I am warning you" LMAO Betty...what are you gonna do? Throw hot pies at Sharon? Girl... #YR
Oh shut up. This ho is bringing up the ranch and Dummer's paternity. Betty, pls. You just threw someone off a balcony. Bitch. #YR
"I think that makes you a hypocrite" YES Sharon put that bitch in her place. #YR
What the hell? Avery bitch you know NOTHING about Sharon. Sit your smug know-it-all ass down. #YR
@WendyJRE DM
Aww Dylan pretended to be against Sharon to make her snap out of her doubt. That's luh&lt;3 #Shylan #YR
Victor condemns Sharon for doing stuff, but he's doing multiple things at once which is far worse. What a hypocritical piece of shit. #YR
Victor is so evil. And the fact that he probably will not pay for these MULTIPLE crimes is SICK. #YR
@ILuvSoapyDrama @BigBBfan1 lol yea she's under house arrest, accused of murders, can't see her kid, has nothing left. So much propping.
@BigBBfan1 watch how those delusional 3 delusional Betty fans will say this is contrived, when Queen Sharon told no lies.
@BigBBfan1 Lol that's how boring Betty is xD
@BigBBfan1 Did Betty really back up? Lmao
Sharon trying to attack Dummer, reading Betty/Dickolas for filth etc. The Queen is on POINT. #YR
So from what I've read Queen Sharon owned the basic peasant. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> those 4 Betty fans better not watch... #YR 
@BigBBfan1 Just reading your tweets gave me all types of life OMG
@BigBBfan1 Yup. Grace and Phyllis were REAL rivals/enemies, and Sharon defeated them. This cupcake skank is NOTHING.
OMG, I can't wait to see QUEEN Sharon drag that basic, hypocritical cupcake baking bitch. What a thing of beauty&lt;3 #YR
@jamdownrocks YESSS BITCH!
@BigBBfan1 Betty comes around all tough yet she's so weak. She is nothing compared to the bitches Sharon has faced in the past. #YR
@BigBBfan1 OMG yesssss
Wait so Queen Sharon Collins calls Betty Crocker a bitch, smug &amp; a hypocrite? I am SO here for that shit. #YR #TeamSharon

LOL #YR

OMG @sharonlcase IS OWNING TH…
@BigBBfan1 OMFG the Queen is giving me life, and I haven't even watched these scenes yet. Own Avery's weak ass, QUEEN. #YR #TeamSharon

YES YES YES…

Then get out of Sharon's house bitch? #YR
@BigBBfan1 OMG YESSS slay Sharon. Call out that fake bitch Betty. #YR
@BigBBfan1 LMAO&lt;33
@BigBBfan1 Lol yes ugh
@BandB_CBS Steffy tbh
@jamdownrocks what a disgusting piece of trash! Are u serious?
@beautiouscy she did well last year <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> beautiful 
@jamdownrocks SMH
Lmao  
@jamdownrocks DM
Sharon, Chloe, Kelly. This show is basically saying that if you're a woman who loses a child, you will go crazy. How offensive. #YR
@ILuvSoapyDrama someone needs to gif that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ILuvSoapyDrama Lmfaoo yes <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that was hilarious
*waits patiently for @BigBBfan1's translation of these Sharon scenes* lol
@ILuvSoapyDrama remember in 2013 where she tried to confront QueenSharon but instead knocked at her door, said back off &amp; ran away <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SKULL>
LMAO oh god I love Kristen <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Queen Sharon is under house arrest, she has nothing. Yet Betty is jealous of Shylan. Stay bitter. Choke on a cupcake. #YR
Oh Lawd that basic bitch Betty is in Sharon's face? Is she gonna say something then run away like she usually does <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> weak bitch. #YR
@jamdownrocks which one?
@Trueblonde64 @KayDEsp @sharonlcase well I was gonna say she was just drunk &amp; having a melt down but yea that too lol. Victor sucks
I hate when actors do crying scenes but there are no tears. Like...even I can fake cry if I think about something really sad or yawn lol.
Carter called that pyscho bitch mom again FFS <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> ugh #FindingCarter 
Ugh Lori such a manipulative bitch. #FindingCarter
I even wanted Ian Ward to be Sharon's father. That's how desperate I am for my girl to get SOME type of family. Ugh... Still nothing #YR
SMH at that bitch Bird breaking up this Tay and Max moment. #FindingCarter
Ugh Carter getting all defend-ish over Lori. SMDH. #FindingCarter
David still comes off as being extremely fake-concerned. #FindingCarter
I hope Trash is killed off this season. Otherwise, he has no point. #FindingCarter
For real? Trash is on again for the 2nd time in 5 mins?? Where is everyone else? Ugh. #FindingCarter
I was just watching the 1st Jurassic Park earlier, and that little girl annoyed the crap out of me. Like she's a child, but what an idiot
Carter please just leave that bitch. She had 0 issues letting you go to prison so that she wouldn't be in trouble. Stupid ho. #FindingCarter
Carter is a doormat, kinda. Forgiving Bird for framing her for grand larceny, and now she's hanging out with Trash? Girl... #FindingCarter
It's depressing that they are all hanging out but my fave Taylor isn't there. :/ #FindingCarter
"thanks for looking after Max"
Really, really bitch? Thanking Trash for looking after Max? Stop. #FindingCarter
Omg I seriously cannot with Trash right now. He grates me. Carter better listen to Elizabeth ugh.. #FindingCarter
Ugh Max, bye. Forgiving TRASH for nearly murdering you is one thing, but being all friendly with him? No. Draw the line. #FindingCarter
OMG seriously, TRASH is in this episode? Ugh... Go away please. They need to introduce some new chars. #FindingCarter
Carter has only known Bird for 3 seconds, and that bitch has already framed her for grand larceny. Like ugh... Go away. #FindingCarter
OMG. There is TOO much damn forgiveness on this show. Carter should never have forgiven that Bird bitch. #FindingCarter
@crabbysister6 LOL exactly.
@jamdownrocks I'm not hating, but IKR. Her line delivery is so dry, she lacks emotion, its obviously a script. Not convincing at all...
"personality" really? Abby/Dummer have no personality. The only young girl on #YR with personality is Mariah and they should use HER instad.
Now they've got Sharon's only friend yelling at her. Yay. The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round... #YR
Abby is a sad excuse for a romantic lead. Unless they re-cast her, she can't be taken seriously. #YR
Pratt says that they want Sharon to make more "mistakes"? The hell? Not only is that annoying to watch, it's completely played out. #YR
@ILuvSoapyDrama @Kimby_D Nick used to be so relevant to the storylines and a character we loved. He's just a rich, arrogant SOB now.
@fatedbliss Exactly! Mariah is feisty and a badass. Dummer &amp; Abbitch are weak, spineless twits. And CG &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone. #YR
I feel like Pratt basically is saying Sharon is a doormat, Sharon is crazy, etc... and that's a good thing? Long sigh. #YR
Does Pratt honestly believe Dummer/Abboring is what people want to see? That's quite concerning. They are very weak characters. #YR
@ILuvSoapyDrama @Kimby_D And that is demonstrated by the fact that nobody gives 2 shits about him &amp; Paige.
Bryton's arms deserve a spin-off soap tbh. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMIRKING FACE> #YR
This daydream sequence was hot AF. #YR #Hevon 
#SHAITH are so precious&lt;3 #YR 
They need to bring Jeff Branson back and do Phonan with Gina. How could you not ship it? #YR 
@ILuvSoapyDrama Yup everyone hates Nick.
@BBohaty I thought they were gonna get married a few months ago ugh
@BBohaty well we don't know their personal relationship. All I know is that I love their chem it's so evident onscreen and off. :(
@BBohaty *hug* I hope they at least work together again one day. Their chemistry is amazing
@ILuvSoapyDrama it also sounded like he said Dylan is just standing up for Sharon. I got nothing to do with Shylan as a couple. :/
@BBohaty ugh I thought it was just a break. This is so sad, I loved them
@ILuvSoapyDrama ......
LMFAO OMG <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SKULL><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@WendyJRE DM
Ivy is such a basic placeholder, I can't wait until Queen Steffy shades her. #BoldandBeautiful
Lmao HOgan is alone &amp; bitter just like she should be. I love that. #BoldandBeautiful
Oh wow the BB account tweeted about Sheila/Taylor. Nice to know they remember some past characters. Ugh #BoldandBeautiful
@minniepearl74 Lol yup. They make this character so annoying. It's time to rapidly age him tbh
@minniepearl74 he gets way too much dialogue for a child.
Liam is so unlikable when he's not with Steffy... #BoldandBeautiful
STFU Brooke, you stupid hooker. Remember how you made Hopeless? Yea, sit down you hypocritical bitch. #BoldandBeautiful
Emma is like under 10 lol why tf would Spencer want her to make a commitment? That's just creepy. Run girl run #GH
Oh god Spencer just please stop talking. The only thing hideous about you is your personality. #GH
"It could be big foot" lmao. #GH
Emma better run the other direction every time Spencer comes around. He is creepy af. #GH
Nikolas back to propping Spencer ugh. #GH
Nathan's arms look bigger. I like. #GH
The fact that #Days thought they only needed Eileen back for such a short period, is very concerning. They have nothing else better.
Why can't they give Lulu and Dante a new set? So over this shoebox. #GH  Well I shouldn't complain, still bigger than any #Days set lol
@minniepearl74 I kind of like Ellie for some reason. I found her annoying, but likable at the same time.
Lmao so Spencer is having flashbacks. #GH
Omg how am I this annoyed by a soap child? Spencer's overexposure and annoyingness has fully taken away any type of cute factor. #GH
Lulu is so harsh on Valarie smh. #GH
Wait I like these Nathan and Ellie scenes. #GH
"My life is over"....oh god UGH Spencer is on AGAIN. UGH. #GH
What corner of the apartment is Valarie staying in? I am confused #GH
Omg I actually love Ellie lmfao. #GH
Ok this is one time I am glad Carly isn't minding her own business. #GH
When Sharon is freed I just hope she burns everyone and everything lol. All of these basic bitches torturing her. #YR
SC is amazing at her portrayal of it, but the writers have no clue how to write bipolar properly. The other characters are so ignorant. #YR
Rewatching the ranch burning scenes from 2012. @sharonlcase really made me cry, she's such a powerful actress.&lt;/3 #YR 
@Julie_Foxy sending prayers rn. DM me if ever you need to talk. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@jamdownrocks @erika_kay10 I thought she was just a temp. place-holder until they found a real re-cast. Yet 2 years later.... Ugh.
@AlanSarapa @Josstheguy Ikr? Victurd needs the Sharon treatment. He is still looked at as a respected member of the community RME. #YR
Abby really is a ho. Getting with her niece and sister's men, all while having the nerve to shame Queen Sharon. Disgusting trashy skank #YR
I just laugh at #YR. They tried to use Sharon to whitewash Dickolas' lying for 18 years but it didn't work. Viewers hate him, we love her.
@erika_kay10 who even works at YR's casting department?! They have serious serious problems. They let real stars go &amp; keep these 'actors' on
@5lu7cy18 DM
@jamdownrocks @erika_kay10 Wtf? They are giving that non-actress an actual pairing? Why haven't they re-casted Abby yet
Anne shoots Duke? Ugh
#YR are really stupid. They could have had Shick marry &amp; Nick forgive Sharon, yet he chose to be an ass and now viewers hate him.
Victor should be in jail for gas-lighting Sharon and now this. It's sick. #YR
You can't compare Victor's destruction to Sharon's. Sharon is hated on by everyone in GC and has to pay and pay. Victurd NEVER pays. #YR
Victurd is such a creep. #YR
SMH at real criminals not paying for crimes while Sharon who did nothing has to suffer. #YR
@USNCS again??
@HedringtoAlta31 meh he still sucks anyway. He's shady and it's obvious he's still hiding stuff
Whats with the rumor that Paige gets pregnant by either Adam or the man slut Dickolas? She's still irrelevant af, sorry. Wannabe Sharon. #YR
@sharonlcase aw <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@jamdownrocks LOL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@jamdownrocks <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Tyler &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Austin, Kyle, etc. Why did they stop showing him <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> #YR's casting is messed up. They let all the good ppl go
Imagine if Nick stood by Sharon. He wouldn't be widely hated by viewers right now. No one cares or is invested in him anymore. #YR
#YR are too transparent. No one gave a damn about their killer s/l so they use Queen Sharon to make it relevant.
@JacquelineMWood Yess Queen <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
SMH, that little sh** Spencer took the ring, I forgot about that mess. Ugh. #GH
Sharon being bussed is normal, but the writing really does suck. There are so many holes &amp; implausible things goin on even for a soap. #YR
I hope the Nurses Ball isn't in the same room it was in the last couple years. It needs to be a bigger set and more extras. #GH
Nina/Franco are sooo filler. #GH
Omg Ned and Olivia are adorable&lt;3 #GH
I kind of like Hayden. And Nikolas deserves this screen time, he's basically been propping Spencer the past few months ugh #GH
Queen Liz looks stunning in that green dress. And ugh I like the fact that Ric loves/wants her THAT much, but girl.....#GH
The #GH MetroCourt is bigger than all #Days sets combined lol
@TXEileen lmao that's hilarious too. Pick are an epic flop
Shylan #5 on the TV Source poll. Yet they're only friends. Meanwhile, Dickolas/Paige are no where to be found...LMAO. #YR
Omg Ava. I feel like Silas is putting her into a coma or something? #GH
LMAO, these family encounters are hilarious, love it. #GH 
Ned should just kill Franco lol. Add Nina in there too. #GH 4/16
Omg Franco is so annoying. #GH 4/16
Nina digging into Nathan's paternity? Why? So pointless. I feel like they are seriously struggling to make Nina relevant. #GH 4/16
I love Lucy, I wish she was on more. #GH
Obrecht is my spirit animal. #GH
Ugh Sonny don't smile with those adorable dimples when I am hating on you. Lol #GH 4/15
Shut up Kiki this is all your damn fault. #GH 4/15
Loving Michael right now. #GH
MS should go full on black / dark brown hair. The blonde tips are meh. #GH 4/15
Nina and Franco ugh... where is Liason -__- #GH 4/15
I love that Obrecht called Nina Nathan's sister. She's so sensitive towards him aw. #GH 4/15
Sonny's daughter is MISSING yet he is completely relaxed and has time to visit Luke. Meanwhile Michael is stressing out. #GH 4/15
"Looks like my son may have taken her" oh shut up Sonny. #GH 4/15
@11tomica DM
@Kathtatum Yes they are everything and I love that they've both been there for eachother, it's not just him being her friend. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Julie_Foxy <GRIMACING FACE>sorry again for all the DMs lol I had to vent
@zachriaul <WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
Ugh no lol  
@credit4bigsalad if he doesn't want Shylan then he's really stupid lol. I hope that's just a rumour tho
Vote for Shylan  guys <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> ----&gt; Soap Couple Playoff Round 1: The Young and the Restless 
#YR
Everyone needs to watch this video LMAO. Dickolas is the biggest slut in #YR history, tbh. 
@laketorres I have a couple clips of that. I can't believe that s/l was 11 years ago :O time flies. Another era, another Sharon framing lol
@laketorres Lol those "hot enough for you" promos were the best haha
@laketorres Lol I loved that time on Y&amp;R, it was hilarious.
@Julie_Foxy Sharon has never been 'needy' like Brooke. It's just the way jealous bitches like Phyllis perceived her man wanting Sharon
Dr. Taylor Hayes Forrester was everything in the 90s &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #BoldandBeautiful 
@jamdownrocks *rest of that night? I'm seeing the 4/20 but Sharon's not on it
@jamdownrocks hey what happened after the cliffhanger where Sharon is holding the necklace and the police come? Did they not show the*
@jamdownrocks Lmao haha
@jamdownrocks @Lutzie25 Blake Hood was the best. I miss him.
@jamdownrocks A real actress should play the part of Victor and Ashley's daughter. Not just a pretty model face.
@Lutzie25 @jamdownrocks Both are terrible.
@jamdownrocks omg lol that was horrible but I think she was supposed to be awful
Dylan: "don't give up" &lt;33  #YR #Shylan
Why Camryn Grimes, the best younger actress in daytime, isn't up for an Emmy, and THOSE people are...it's a SIN. A complete &amp; utter joke #YR
@jamdownrocks Lmao ikr. Like MO too. She's terrible, I hate being mean but its the truth. The line delivery is flat and she has no range.
All of these disgusting fuckwits acting like Sharon is the confirmed killer. Like Michael said that's what a trial is for, BITCH. #YR
Paige is the fakest person in Genoa City history lmao. Like, what a fake bitch. #YR
@jamdownrocks Chylan and Davery were a boring MESS, a waste of screentime. If that's how he really feels then he's stupid lol
@jamdownrocks It is. One of many lol
@Julie_Foxy he and Dummer a gross. Ugh
@Julie_Foxy IKR I was like "dgijdfhmdhz". Gimme those Shylan feels&lt;333 :')
Kyle speaks in such an non-sincere, snide &amp; creepy away. It seems like he's the killer and a psychopath. #YR
@Julie_Foxy Yup lol
"You gotta trust me" 
"I do trust you."
THE SHYLAN FEELS! Soapgasm. #YR 
@BBohaty like ugh she's so dramatic. She couldn't get Hope on skype BEFORE the wedding? She's such an evil slut
That rumor about SBu not wanting Shylan BETTER not be true, bc Shylan is the only thing making his character interesting at all. #YR
@Julie_Foxy B&amp;B's younger cast is much stronger. Maybe Y&amp;R just don't have a lot of money for casting lol
I hope once Queen Sharon is revealed to be innocent, she finds that Sandy woman &amp; files a civil suit against Dickolas' repugnant ass. #YR
@Julie_Foxy the only good decision Y&amp;R have made recently was casting Camryn/Gina/Justin. The other castings have flopped miserably
@Julie_Foxy Aw lol. I am surprised too
It wasn't enough that we had to endure that gross Phuck affair,but the product of it (Dummer) has been one of the worst chars in #YR history
No offence but #YR do a terrible job at casting for a lot of their younger generation. #BoldandBeautiful have a much stronger younger cast.
@Julie_Foxy WOOP! Slay. No kiss, no history, nothing. All they have is chemistry &amp; viewers buzzing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"Sometimes the best isn't good enough"
Queen Sharon serving depressive poetry. Slay. #YR
I'm not watching #YR at this moment but I just felt like hating on Dickolas: Dickolas, you suck. F*** you.
They should have written Billy out tbh. I mean what they did with Adam was smart. They waited a while before finding the perfect recast #YR
Shut up HOpe... Look at who your damn mother is. A drunken sex addict. Do not come for Quinn. #BoldandBeautiful
@Julie_Foxy Yup. Brooke becomes an alcoholic mess over no sex for 1 second. Sharon has lost everything &amp; is still standing and fighting
Ew Hopeless... That girl still blaming others #BoldandBeautiful
@Julie_Foxy HOgan is always butting into couples and not minding her own damn business. I can't believe people compare her to Sharon. Ugh
"STOP" Oh shut up you whore. Brooke = annoying, rude, disrespectful, over dramatic &amp; desperate. #BoldandBeautiful
Quinn and Deacon are so pretty, they belong together. Two effed up people who are perfect together. Go away HOgan #BoldandBeautiful
Maya and Nicole need to stop having convos in this office lol. #BoldandBeautiful
Steffy is hot, and they have history...so why tf Lame is with this Aus-Steffy bot? It's a contrived mess. #BoldandBeautiful
FFing through this AusSteffy/Liam dialogue. #BoldandBeautiful
Quinn look stunning. Brooke is just pressed. #BoldandBeautiful
Queen Steffy NEEDS to shade Aus-Steffy and say "she doesn't even go here". LMAO. Make it happen. #BoldandBeautiful
The slut did not give a shit about Deacon for over 10 years now she cares about him SOOOOO much? No, you're just thirsty. #BoldandBeautiful
Ew Liam and AusSteffy. What a basic couple. Queen Steffy needs to come and save us. #BoldandBeautiful
Ugh it's so annoying that the Spencers are living in Taylor's house and Wyatt is living in Taylor's beach house. Smh lol. #BoldandBeautiful
Brooke, what a disgusting slut. She cannot let anyone else be happy in life. Always ruining the best couples. #BoldandBeautiful
I love how Queen Sharon didn't even care about the press conference on her arrest. She has developed such a thick skin. #YR
To all the bitches that don't want Shylan bc he's Dickolas' relative.... Like no. #YR 
@Julie_Foxy thanks Julie <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@TXEileen @YouTube @sharonlcase thanks <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@WendyJRE @YouTube @sharonlcase Thanks girl <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Sharon Newman - Fighter 
@Julie_Foxy Weird. I loved Patrina (not as much as Sakey). How can that be when Phick/Shadam are on Y&amp;R's poll? SMh
@Julie_Foxy Bitch, please. Sharon was Dylan's friend &amp; the 1st person he met in town before the stupid retcon thing. These Shaters....
Best B&amp;B couple ever. 90s Ridge &amp; Taylor &gt;&gt;&gt; #BoldandBeautiful. 
"Don't take this personally but you really are a moron" I love Kristen she's so considerate&lt;3 #Days
This discount/wannabe EJ person makes me cringe. #Days
Nicole has been on #Days for years. Does she really have to be subjected to be referred to as a skanky old porn star? Ugh
Shouldn't the baby be in a hospital? #Days
IDGAF, Kristen better keep her baby. Theresa and Brady can have another lol. #Days
How tf did this stupid bitch Melanie figure out the WHOLE story ? This seems stupid as hell. #Days
Ugh the writers keep trying to drag Nicole down &amp; make her unlikable. Why is she in Theresa's face?! She shouldn't even care FFS. #Days
#Days need to kill off Daniel. Just kill him off, have no one care. See ratings wise.
Ugh I have to sit through this crappy show just to watch the Kristen scenes. #Days
@Julie_Foxy LOL here for that xD
@boogieXlove DM lol
@BigBBfan1 DM
@SoapDigest Yesss slay @sharonlcase &lt;33
@Julie_Foxy DM
Lmao Shaters be like "Sharon brought this on herself" really bitch, really? #dead #YR
@Julie_Foxy sent u like 80 DMs sorry <CONFUSED FACE>
Where TF is Mariah? Why do we have to put up with Abbitch &amp; Dummer? I'd rather CG have both of their screentime combined. #YR
Even Victoria is dumb enough to believe Sharon murdered 2 young people? RME. Everyone apart from Dylan/Stitch/Michael are idiots. #YR
@SkyLizzels Lol ikr? she's such a waste of space. She needs to take her off-screen ex husband and off-screen history and go back off-screen
Updated the Sharon arrest collection. #YR #FreeSharon 
Watching #TBBT and wait, it's Courtney. #YR 
@jamdownrocks DM
I mean...if #YR are gonna arrest Sharon for the 910th time at least do it right, give us a mugshot.
Kind of sad we didn't get to see a Sharon mugshot. I was really looking forward to adding to the collection. #YR
#Days is just SO out-of-touch with the viewers. Not just bc of their taping so far ahead. They just don't get what people want.
Like why would #Days not get ED for as long as possible? They are clearly too confident in their regular s/ls. And they shouldn't be
The fact that #Days only wanted ED, the person that has saved this show from being completely boring since 2013, for 10 episodes, is stupid
@Julie_Foxy yup. Same.
@Julie_Foxy they are entertaining tho <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Julie_Foxy LMFAO.... They are dumb as hell. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Good lord. They're the biggest joke of a fanbase ever tbh
@Julie_Foxy plus Betty is a bitch. She plays men like yoyos. Dick/Dylan Dylan/Joe. Fake skank
@Julie_Foxy lmao exactly. They are just pressed about Shylan. Dylan is actually a good guy he just is annoying outside of Shylan scenes lol
@Julie_Foxy Yes I love when CLB and SC share scenes. I remember he was her lawyer in the Cameron Kirsten time
Ikr? I actually enjoyed those scenes  
Lmao here Betty fans are again going "Free Betty". Bitch please. When your fave actually gets bad writing then ask for freedom <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
@jamdownrocks Lmaoo yes those emails what a mess
The part with the tie tho. That was so hot. #YR 
This moment was iconic tbh. This is my new meme in life. #YR 
The Queen looked amazing in this dress. Sharon's court house fashion has always been on point. @sharonlcase #YR 
Queen Sharon is the biggest survivor on #YR. No other in town has been thru more adversity, hate or judgement. SMH.
The writers attempt at making Abbyslut "witty" or funny is a complete fail. The line delivery is flat and I cringe @ her lame comebacks. #YR
Abboring is like "I've seen 2 corpses, I've been stalked" etc. Slut, please. Queen Sharon has been thru 100x more than that in her life #YR
I can't believe Queen Sharon used to babysit this worthless piece of skank basic trash (Abbitch) as a child. SMH. She gets NO credit. #YR
@jamdownrocks Hey when did this line happen? 
LMFAO Abifail's face. #YR 
@Julie_Foxy lol "sake"
@SweetHott74 @peachykeen83 I bet they'll have her hate Sharon when she grows up next year lol
@jamdownrocks especially when Taylor gave Ridge 3 kids and 9 years of marriage. Wtf did Brooke give him apart from RJ? Nothing. Lol
@jamdownrocks lmaoo. And it's funny how she always makes it sound like Tay was the evil one who came in between her &amp; Ridge - Rme...
@jamdownrocks I saw this clip from B&amp;B February, with HOgan going on about how she will easily get Ridge back in a flash *2 months later* ??
@Julie_Foxy I used to like Spixie but that ended in like 2011 lol. Nathan &gt;&gt;
Hope and Liam are the worst #BoldandBeautiful couple ever tbh. Next to Bridge. They were engaged like 29 times and never married lmaoo
@jamdownrocks Ikr?! It's so funny that Bill went back to Katie and now Ridge doesn't care about Brooke. The slut is not a keeper at all.
@Julie_Foxy Lope were the worst ugh.
@jamdownrocks If Deacon wasn't taken, Brooke wouldn't have looked twice at him. She's always destroying good couples. Tridge, Batie, etc. Ho
@jamdownrocks *Taylor went to Nick...And then guess what, Brooke wanted Nick too and not Ridge anymore. RME.... She's so low.
@jamdownrocks She's so petty. Like she was desperate to have Ridge for years when he was w/ Taylor, then Tridge finally ended, and then*
@lostdogs20 @mrsshephard23 @TalkSoap ugh... I swear if this happens <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@jamdownrocks Ugh... I actually like Deacon and Quinn from what I've seen. Why can't BrHOOKe find her own man <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Oh shut up Noah. You little shit. Lol. I hope Queen Sharon fucks everybody up for the hell they are putting her through rn #YR
Why did #YR spend 14 seconds zooming into Adam's face? Lol so random
Sharon has been single for nearly 7 months now. Dickolas is the slut. #YR
@JTRules1 SO true
Dickolas and Paige still have no chemistry and are extremely pointless. They had no value to the show. The end. #YR
WHY would Chelsea marry this when all of THAT is living right across her hall? Like can she see...lol #YR
Kyle is a psycho, he could be the killer. He could have killed Austin/Courtney to comfort Dummer and get closer to her weak behind. #YR
"I got a lot of money" - what an arrogant fuckwit Dickolas is. Yea a lot of money...like that $500 million u took from Victor? LOL. #YR
Sharon was never a gold digger. She worked hard as a teen. The fact that she married into money was just luck. Paige is a gold digger. #YR
Ew Paige just touched Chelsea. Chelsea better go wash herself, that dirty bitch must have had floor sex w/ Dickolas 300 times today. #YR
What happened to that spoiler that said Gabe supports Sharon? Adam would definitely be there for Sharon right now. This is contrived. #YR
I really miss Queen Dru. She was Sharon's biggest supporter, she would be dragging everyone so hard right now. #YR
It would make sense for creepy Kyle to be a killer. His mother was murdered &amp; Jack hasn't been a real father at all.  #YR
Everything about Paige's character is basic af. #YR
@42nagirl the #YR writers should watch #Empire. They depict bipolar as a real illness and the other characters are sensitive about it.
So just bc Sharon is bipolar and switched a test result she's capable of murder? Is that what these hacks are trying to run with? #YR
This f*cking SOB Prickolas is gonna keep Faith away from her fave parent. You suck. Like honestly. Die in a fire. #YR
Dickolas you are just an IDIOT. An ass. A spineless twit. Basic. #YR
Eff you, Dickolas. Keep screwing your basic side bitch and running that flop underground. Queen Sharon will rise, but you'll always suck #YR
Dickolas is a worthless piece of shit and has always been weak. I hope the ugly ass underground collapses again. #YR
I don't mind crazy s/ls. The worst part of Sharon's destruction is the writers &amp; the other characters treating her illness like a joke #YR
"i'm guilty. My life's over"

Ugh. Shar needs to be hugged&lt;/3 #YR
Why did they turn Kyle into such a little bitch?! Blake Hood was the only good Kyle tbh. #YR
@jamdownrocks DM
Oh god this f*cking weak &amp; whiny bitches of Genoa City need to die. Honestly. Queen Sharon needs to kill them all for real. #YR
Ronan was one of my faves, he was so hot. I wish he was still on #YR
@jamdownrocks Yes get rid of Betty or Paige, replace her with Olivia.
@jamdownrocks Ugh pieces of shit. They need to die.
This dialogue/storyline is so stupid. #Days
#Days really needs to stop with the dramatic music for non-drama
Does Eileen ever age? She's flawless. #Days 
Aw Kristen and her baby&lt;3 So cute. #Days
I feel like I could watch #Days once every month and the same thing would be happening. It's so slow
How has this Paige girl not been recast yet? #Days
Only watching #Days for Queen Kristen
Brady is a slut. I mean how many women has he been with in the last 3 years? Nicole Kristen Madison Theresa Melanie etc #Days
Why does this couch Eric and this redhead are sitting on look like the #Days producers pulled it off the side of the road?
Who is this Discount-EJ person?  #Days
@Shicked @erika_kay10 I forgot to add several things lol
The-Walking-STD has no respect for anyone's relationships. Ugh. Slut. #BoldandBeautiful
@Jillian002 Exactly...no reason lol. Katie did not lie at all.
Why TF is this bitch ranting about Quinn slapping her? The slut DESERVED it. I mean she slapped Taylor/Katie for no reason #BoldandBeautiful
@JizForever Exactly, awful copping and brother-ing lol. Even if my sibling was a cop...u aren't going thru my house without a warrant
Quinn and Deacon are cute. There is the slut trying to break up another couple. Ugh. Isn't she getting too old for that #BoldandBeautiful
Yesss Sabrina &amp; Michael are everything right now&lt;3 #GH
Who cares if Michael didn't let Dante search the place RME. Bitch pls. I would never let someone search my home w/out a warrant #GH
Aw Michael is so stressed :( Sabrina have sex with him to calm him down lol. #GH #Sakey
Shut up Sonny ugh #GH
Oh god Franco and Nina yelling at eachother. How redundant lol... #GH
Ellie and Spinelli are so draining lol #GH
Let me mute the screen. I can't with Morgan and Kiki overkill. #GH
Queen Sabrina better get to the bottom of this. #GH
Wish Laura would make a guest appearance.. Missing Genie. #GH
OMG SHUT UP KIKI AND MORGAN JUST SHUT UP lawd have mercy I cannot listen to these little bitches anymore. #GH
"She's gone and I know who took her" Oh STFU Morgan. #GH
@JTRules1 @BigBBfan1 yes<WINKING FACE>
@Julie_Foxy I thought Patrina had a lot of chem. I just hated the rushed storyline, it was all for Robin's return ugh.
@jamdownrocks they should have changed to half hour years ago. It's too boring and cheap to run for a whole hour
#Days should take note from #BoldandBeautiful. They only use a small number of sets &amp; characters and it works for 30mins.
@andrea9192 IKR? It's horrible.
#Days need to get rid of all these horrible characters, cut down to half hour, bring back a couple proper sets &amp; then I would watch
I won't feel sad when #Days gets cancelled soon. I mean there is a lot they could have done. The show is boring. It ended last year tbh
OMG @ #Days ratings. That's so so sad, but at the same time you can't expect good numbers for a show with crappy storylines &amp; boring chars.
@Julie_Foxy Carrrrlos is so worthless. He doesn't deserve Sabrina. Sakey &gt;&gt;&gt;
@jamdownrocks Lol
@GretelDFV unfortunately yes. Fortunately it was never actually shown onscreen, thank god
Smh Brooke needs to go to sleep or something. Her need to destroy couples and steal men is so played out. #BoldandBeautiful
@THEBEST110985 I wonder if they will give Steffy her office set back
@BBohaty @SuperheroFeed Lol ikr <CONFUSED FACE>
@BBohaty <CONFUSED FACE> lol  
Katie to Brooke "You're too old to get pregnant" "I guess you're sooo virile and fertile"
Lmaoo #BoldandBeautiful
Re-watching Brooke's birthday party scenes from 2013. LMAO these were freakin hilarious. Brooke's face... #BoldandBeautiful
Look at all of the traumatic events that Queen Sharon has survived, yet she is supposedly "weak". #YR #TeamSharon 
@bizzygirl1 LOL true just had to add on for dramatic effect xD
So far in the last few months Sharon has lost her man, custody of her child, has a stupid job &amp; is accused of murder by everyone... Yay? #YR
Abby is such a worthless ho. Sleeping with Austin, she'll prob be with Stitch soon. Who's next? Any female relatives left? #YR
omg when Adam's tie was left on after he ripped his shirt off, that was SO hot... *FANS SELF* #YR
Ugh can #YR stop using forgettable songs during love scenes. This is not a prime time show. I NEED saxophone music
Slut Abby to Stitch: "I guess we're stuck with eachother"
whore, you are just thirsty for another relative's man #YR 
I hope the real killer clocks Abifail again lmaoo how hilarious would that be? #YR
Haha Michael went all Natalia Kills "I'm not even gonna dignify u with a response" on Abby lmao. She's such a dumb slut. #YR
Queen Sharon has knocked out police officers, gone on the run, scared off thugs etc &amp; will now wear an ankle monitor. She's so gangsta. #YR
Michael &lt;3 #TeamSharon's hero rn. #YR
I dont follow this stuff but WHY is Billy kissing Victoria in a public place? Is he still engaged to Chelsea? That's sloppy as hell. #YR
@jamdownrocks @mikashaye The original Chadam (or Chadumb lol) were boring &amp; annoying. Them and their stupid moving to Paris every week lmao
"Not guilty your honor" SAY it Queen&lt;3 And honestly..this BITCH Avery acting like she defends the innocent always? Sit down. LIES. #YR
SN's life sucks right now but @sharonlcase looks FAB in this light blue dress :') I love it. #YR
@jamdownrocks @mikashaye Yup. I can't hate that.
@mikashaye @jamdownrocks They have chemistry tho. It's undeniable. First time ChelC has been likable in a pairing. All her others suck
Wait...this whore Abby came TO Sharon's hearing and said "waiting for me?" what the actual fuhhk? LOL. Sit down you stupid bitch #YR
@mikashaye @jamdownrocks NuChadam's sex is LIFE tbh. Coming from basically a hater of the original lol
@jamdownrocks DM
Ew look at Abifail's skanky &amp; vindictive face. Why is this tramp here?? #YR
Abboring is just ASKING to be hated on lmao...#YR
LMFAOO still laughing at the fact that they had that fake ass pathetic airheaded skank in QUEEN Sharon's face. What a joke. #YR
@jamdownrocks DAMMN I may ship this lol. They're hot af
@Janeb_Soapfan @5lu7cy18 ...like did he actually make the effort to find a pic of Queen Sharon, have it printed/laminated &amp;put in his wallet
@Janeb_Soapfan @5lu7cy18 Yup lmao he had one when showing comatose Phyl her face. He couldn't just get one on his phone? Creepy
FREE SHARON

Btw Queen @sharonlcase is working that gorgeous light blue dress. #YR #SaveSharon
When Queen Sharon is acquitted she better flip her hair and walk out of the room like #YR 
@jimmyyadig @jamdownrocks OMG I love you. Are you a comedian? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I hope when the truth comes out about Sharon being framed, Shylan have celebratory sex. Jk. Maybe a kiss. Lol. <GRIMACING FACE> #YR
When the truth comes out Sharon will still be hated. These bitches will be like "Oh but she's STILL awful" &amp; won't apologize. Ugh. #YR
@jamdownrocks Saw a pic. They look hot ^^
@jamdownrocks Lmfaoo! What a joke her character has become
@jamdownrocks So Michael will be living with Sharon?
@jamdownrocks I read that they were requesting that. Oh so it was granted? That's good
@jamdownrocks oh ok so she doesn't have to stay in jail? Does she have that ankle bracelet thing?
Victor could have just had a pic of Sharon on his phone. But no. He carries around a photo of her in his wallet...Creepy. Lol #YR
@jamdownrocks where are Sharon and Noah?
@jamdownrocks Julie Marie Berman needs to play Abby. That just needs to happen. #YR
@jamdownrocks idk but they r always tweeting on the Y&amp;R tl
@foxaylove @TXEileen Dickolas did the same thing when Shar was accused of killing Skye. He's such an asshole &amp; so unreliable. #YR
@insidemyworld71 LMAO! It's so obvious Victor is obsessed with Sharon. I mean he kept a physical photo of her with him... creepy. #YR
@splashdpow Oh shut the hell up Dickolas. Sharon murdered no one. Prickolas is the neanderthal that has nearly killed people. #YR
@Spicenthingsup LMAO
@teeveejeff there is like 1 that's always on the Y&amp;R tl. That's it. 1. Lmao
@jamdownrocks LMAO seethe. And the non-acting would make that enough funnier
Lmao Dickolas/Paige only have like 1 fan on here <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YR
"@Ashley93_1: Tomorrow #YR Sharon is denied bail ."

The wheels on the bus go round and round....
@_DaveBedford SLUT! EW! DIAF
I'm reading that Queen Sharon has scenes with that bobblehead slut Abifail? Ew. Gross. That peasant shouldn't be in Shar's orbit #YR
ugh why is TRASH stalking Max? Go away. #FindingCarter 
Where is Doris? Like she's been absent for so much. Ugh... #YR
I love Drunk Taylor. #FindingCarter
Poor Taylor :( SMH. #FindingCarter
Love Carter's persistence for Maxlor&lt;3  #FindingCarter
The Wilson family are looking pretty. #FindingCarter
Lori just needs to stop. Can we throw her and Trash off a cliff. #FindingCarter
@watroswatros looking pretty&lt;3 #FindingCarter 
OMG what is Siobhan/Smelanie doing here? Lol I hope she rids Queen Elizabeth of David's worthless behind. #FindingCarter #GH #YR
OMG Trash just go away you worthless piece of junk, like seriously. He's so grating #FindingCarter
Yesss Queen Elizabeth go ham on this fool Trash. #FindingCarter
Carter has become so anti-Lori, it just soothes my soul&lt;33 #FindingCarter
Aww at Elizabeth calling Carter "baby". The feels are real :') Lori who? #FindingCarter
Aww Carter is actually thinking of others this season. I love it. #FindingCarter
uGHHH why is Max being borderline nice to Trash. like STOP #FindingCarter
Grant's voice gets deeper like every episode ugh I hate when people grow up lol. #FindingCarter
It still seems like David is hiding something. He's shady as hell. Leave him and never look back Queen Elizabeth #FindingCarter
Ugh Crash is such a worthless character, I don't see why they had to bring him back ugh. Esp after that traumatic shooting #FindingCarter
Poor Nathan :( #GH 4/13
Why is this girl sorry about threatening to kill Luke? I would have done the same thing lol. #GH 4/13
@andrea9192 It's terrible.
"It was for the best" oh shut up bitches #GH 4/13
Aw&lt;33 Sabrina bringing Michael a tray. #GH #Sakey 4/13
LMAOO those two idiots Morgan and Kiki, what a joke. #GH 4/13
If #YR are just teasing us with Shylan, that's wrong on so many levels...<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Behind on #GH. Lmao I hear AJ got stolen while under the care of those juvenile delinquents <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> She better go back to King Michael soon
OMG <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Sakey&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 


Shylan <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #YR 
@jamdownrocks @WilsonSamie0050 lmao really? What happened
My poor Queen Sharon <DISAPPOINTED FACE> smh this show just keeps draining her. #YR #SaveSharon 
@kellwoohoo otherwise, she's useless. She brings nothing to the show.
@BigBBfan1 @jamdownrocks <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kellwoohoo I would love if she's actually using Dickolas / manipulating him. It would give her character a purpose. He deserves to suffer.
Paige and her useless romance w/ Dickolas adds nothing of value to the show. So pointless. #YR
@Julie_Foxy wish there was a HQ one online
Lmao I remember all of us just for the fun of it kept saying Sharon would be blamed for the murder and now look<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> LOL. #SaveSharon #YR
@5lu7cy18 side note; I miss Jimmy's bar. It was around for years until JFP, and was so much better than the underground
I hope Queen Kristen gets to keep the baby. She deserves to be a mother&lt;3 #Days
@TXEileen She used to be written as no f*cks given &amp; fun, I miss that.
Can someone explain this Kristen-baby thing to me?? I know what happened when she left the show last but when was this child born?
Ugh, just 5 seconds of Kristen's face on #Days &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; months of Ashley doing nothing at #YR.
I don't follow #Days closely but when did Kristen steal the embryo or whatever? Shouldn't this baby be in the hospital and very premature?
The last time Sharon had a well-written storyline was like 2004 lol... #YR #SaveSharon
So based on Sharon's "history" she will be denied bail or sth? WTF? History of what? Being falsely convicted..? Thats some stupid shit. #YR
Couldn't #YR possibly have involved someone else in this s/l? Sharon has been framed for murder twice before. Don't the writers do research?
@WendyJRE Betty
Shylan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #YR 
@peachykeen83 @erika_kay10 @CBSDaytime Yup. Shick probably had like 8-10 love scenes in 2014 &amp; that's a lot. These fools have 4 in a month?
@erika_kay10 @peachykeen83 #YR are trying so hard with Sick, it's sad. They are overcompensating for the fact that they are irrelevant.
Dickolas and Paige have like 900 love scenes. it's gross... they are not in demand at ALL. Like no. We'd rather see a Shylan love story #YR
@jamdownrocks @foxaylove Sick are the supercouple of our generation.
@foxaylove @jamdownrocks I mean look at those hits. YT better not freeze up with all of that online traffic
@foxaylove @jamdownrocks Y&amp;R need to keep their legions of fans happy ;) 
Dickolas:
2010: Phyllis/Sharon
2011: Diane/Phyllis/Avery
2012: Phyllis/Avery
2013: Avery
2014: Sharon
2015: Sage

Such a man slut. #YR
Sharon getting arrested is not the issue (well it is lol). People already hate her for things she did years ago. Stop piling on ugh #YR
@Julie_Foxy DM
@erika_kay10 Omg
@erika_kay10 Oh sit Victurd. Will Faith be better off with drunk Nikki? Sharon is the only one that is there for that girl emotionally #YR
@jamdownrocks @BigBBfan1 Sounds awful. omg. Waiting for Cindy's translation xD her tweets are better than the show
@KingMinos777 I felt like barfing. How dare that little punk man handle a woman he doesn't even know. He's such a creep. #YR
@jamdownrocks 
@jamdownrocks OMG lmaoo!!!
@jamdownrocks LMFAOO OMG Cher is that the writer's idea of a joke? Did he actually compare them working together to Jayonce?! #dead
I can't even watch #Days anymore. Like there is no point in having a show with a micro-budget. All the good sets r gone. It sucks.
I think what I do has class to it...I'll say that"
- Janet Jackson vs Madonna 
@AlanSarapa Victurd was forgiven for the Mariah thing in 2 months. Meanwhile here Sharon is being treated like a murderer FFS...
Like, I do get it. #YR need Sharon to make their horrible &amp; weak murder mystery storyline interesting, but having those kids in Shar's face?
Creepy Kyle manhandling Sharon was just...disturbing. It was unneeded and just proves how much #YR need to pile hate on Sharon.

I am going to need someone, ANYONE, to punch these idiots in the th…
Lmao at the YR account using the term "under the bus". #trolling
