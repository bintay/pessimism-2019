@blbolton11 Why do you hate me?
And after all I've done for you . . .
Is there a word or phrase that carries a negative connotation for hopeful and/or optimistic? Or is that just being "perpetually distracted"?
@sssydnie No explanation needed . . .

@ATTCares Thanks for taking the time to look into it for me. Couldn't be sure if I was just going crazy or not!
@ATT I'm in Las Vegas. If I were in Garden City, KS maybe I'd be understanding. What is the issue . . . 
I need a home.
@sssydnie don't tell me what to do
@Jake_Rixton Was a good run, but it's time for retirement. I'll always have fond memories of being in your pants...

@blbolton11 Thanks for offering your room to me while I'm out there. Who knew you were so generous?!
Possibly the most genuinely thoughtful thing I'll ever receive in my life. 
I have nothing to offer.
Not even chicken fingers and fries.
I'm so sorry.
shame on me
There was a point where I knew what it was to have eye-sex from across the bar . . . now I wonder if I'm eye-raping girls from a distance.

@AmericanAir I made it! Good thing your self check-in is straightforward. And that I'm not out of "Gate" 44 again . . .
Where my bag would be right now if anyone had actually input the retrieval request like 2 agents told me they had. 
@Delta Why wasn't I told about this when I checked with them 33 minutes ago. GET IT TOGETHER. Absolutely no communication.
@Delta I've been waiting for 33 minutes. Checked to make sure it wouldn't be another hour. Told the bag retrieval request was never entered.
@AmericanAir Might need to call in this favor in if @Delta doesn't get my bag back to me soon . . . 
@Delta And let's hope it takes less time than what I just spent at your disService Desk.
@Delta Ok so now if I could please get my checked bag back so I make the flight I booked with @AmericanAir instead that would be great . . .
@Delta Your 4 hour delay just cost me $1,600 . . .
@Delta So they can offer refunds at the desk, but can't actually carry them out on their own?!
@Delta Also a ridiculous how many calls agents need to make to other people to work nothing out. Assistance needs that much assistance?
@Delta An hour later and the best option I was given was, "take a refund and figure it out yourself. next." . . .
@Delta And everyone behind me has gotten out of line because you're telling everyone there's nothing you can do. 
@Delta You don't even have 1 agent per delayed flight working this desk . . . How do you expect to help even 10% of your customers.
@Delta Just standing in line at Help Desk behind 10 other people while any chance I have of working this out ticks by.
@Delta NOT OKAY. 4 hour delay? You just found out in the last 15 minutes?!
LAX to JFK DL412
@Delta Paid $600 to move flight to make sure I got to Montreal by 12a. As soon as I get through security, flight moves from 12:30p to 4:51p.
@morimakesmusic N O O O O O ! ! !
WHAT HAVE I DONE?! 
@morimakesmusic 
Me: "Well maybe we can get a drink when I get back then?"
Her: "Ohh! Yeah you can take me to . . ."
Me: "Actually nevermind. I'm busy."
I mean, maybe right? Who knows . . . 
@blbolton11 no no. is mine.
@chrisdoesthings @blbolton11 hilldale house has become haunted since I left in feb. sure you've noticed. just FYI. will report back later.
. . . in LA, everyone else is just a peripheral character in your own made-for-TV movie.
You want the truth? Okay. In NYC people realize they're just a character in everyone else's daily life . . .
@AmericanAir "Gate" 44 at LAX reminds me of the double-wide they park on the soccer field when a grade school is under construction . . .
@sssydnie back to Denver tomorrow afternoon to get ready for 2 weeks in Canada or something.
@sssydnie well you just missed it - I felt my first earthquake ever last night. don't argue with me - yes, technically it was an earthquake.
We're sitting next to each other right now.
Thanks for nothing @ATT @ATTCares . 
"TIME" stands for The International Magazine of Events. How have I never known this.
c'mon just let me touch it.
just once . . . 
. . . aaaaand I missed Ratatat at The Ogden today. DAMMIT.

@sssydnie you spelled "conservative" wrong . . .
I just want an instrumental loop of this intro for like, I dunno . . . maybe 12 minutes or something?

@sssydnie I have a 24/7 day job remember?
@sssydnie I was coming down from the top of the hills! No WiFi, no reception. Sorry! It didn't even ring!

Why am I not dating a celebrity who's too busy to actually see regularly? That sounds so ideal . . .

@matsoR Hey. Why don't I have your # anymore? I don't know. Do you have mine? Maybe not. Text me. Super simple question. Thanks (and sorry).
@sssydnie I'll get to it when things slow down a little!
@sssydnie Well I left the house at 8:30a and I'll be home at 11p - so it's exactly as you heard it last! Sorry!
@sssydnie HAHAHA! Do you work 8 hour days or something?!
@sssydnie I wouldn't know I guess. I only know how women react to an ass with or without <BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN><BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN><BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN><BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN>.
@sssydnie 2 weeks later same girl's telling her friends, "He's nice I guess. He just doesn't treat me like the princess I am." Because no <BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN>.
@sssydnie "No, but he's actually really sweet sometimes. You just don't know him like I do."
@sssydnie Just saying you wouldn't have a pity sesh with the girls if the boy had <BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN>.
They'd hold an intervention and you'd be defending him.

@sssydnie and I was just saying I'm with you. I mean, I won't live that long, but j can relate to the sentiment.
@sssydnie @CASHMERECAT well obviously.
I just want to date a sideline reporter with big curls and a raspy voice.
Wait. I'm confused. Is it

Can we patch into that please? 

It's not procrastination, it's

@OMFbrewing my new spot in Denver. How did I not know about this. Absolutely amazing.
@sssydnie probably for the best . . .
@sssydnie aren't all the snapchats I send you good enough?!?
@sssydnie I made an account at some point. I don't know if I downloaded the app. Not sure I take enough pictures to make it worthwhile . . .
@sssydnie mostly alive I think, yeah.

aaaand there goes this afternoon . . .

@TheGee32 HOW DID YOU FIND ME.
What did I do to get my account locked? 
I don't understand . . .
@MarkRonson They're awarded for "outstanding achievement" . . . what has Morning Phase achieved? Beyonce put out a record with no buildup.
@MarkRonson You're not wrong, but we're talking about the Grammys - who said they had anything to do with artistry . . .
After an incredibly eventful weekend, Monday has finally arrived again and brought with it the same uncomfortable boredom as last week.
@blbolton11 . . . wut. 
@Julialights_ I should figure that out huh? I got it, but then I never actually used it. Not even once. <GRIMACING FACE>
@Danny_Rixton Absolutely incredible. 10/10   Well done.


Nope. LA is the worst and you'll never convince me otherwise . . .

I've never seen a sunset this bright. Unbelievable. 

Been a minute since you spit off that balcony onto fans you mean? Oh and you feel like people judge you? Aw so sorry.
Apparently women on Tinder think "bio" = "insert list of demands here" . . .
Yeah, I wear a hat now. Get used to it.
I haven't gotten to rock a black eye in like a really long time . . .
If you think men are shallow you should check out some of these girls' Tinder profiles in LA. Unbelievable. Minimum salary requirements?!
I thought a day was 24 hours. As in, NEXT DAY delivery. Shipment confirmation email Monday at 3p. Scheduled delivery Wednesday by 5p. WHAT?
So UPS requires you to sign for delivery unless you enroll is their service? That's garbage. And so is their website.
WAIT . . . Is Mac n Cheese macaroni AND cheese or macaroni IN cheese?

@VeraBrezhneva I'm about to head to LA for a month. Where are you?!
Life would be so much easier if women approached men and men never approached women . . .
When I get a text and my name is in all caps I know that at some point they've texted someone, "WE'RE GONNA BE RICH." AutoCorrect remembers.
Still glad I never got into live sound.
There was probably NEVER a time we DIDN'T have dog leashes.
Overheard a guy walking his dog: 
"what did we do before leashes?"
I'm pretty sure that's how we domesticated them in the 1st place so . . .

People wear white socks? Why?
@Melodyne makes me feel like GOD. 
And I am a very generous God indeed . . .

I just made the best pun of my life and got nothing but death stares in return. This world is so unfair.
I got a match on Tinder once.
Conversation quickly became laborious.
Very quickly. 
Immediately, in fact. 
She was a bot. 
I cried.

If you're on the west coast, just a

@AaronWalchli Denver. We have lots of good cruise ship ports . . .

@AaronWalchli Yeah well that's because you never did come to NYC . . .

@ATT throttling my data like crazy right now. Okay okay. You win. I give up. Sheeesh. Bye-bye legacy unlimited plan; totally useless &gt;5GB.

@RixtonOfficial Where you boys hiding?
@RynWeaver thanks for the invite tonight. That was fun!!
You can tell me anything. Seriously. 
Please believe me. I can relate to all of it.
I get it. I've probably done it myself even.
I love you.
I don't even know what to say. Be grateful I guess. Dunkin Donuts in NYC at 4:15a. It's freezing outside. 
Also, Stephen Baldwin is kind of a badass normal dude. So awesome to randomly run into him.
I just realized my ex is actually really hot. Who knew?

I can't believe 2015 will come and there will still be no italics. How will people ever knew I'm being cleverly sarcastic?

All I'll say is, if Max doesn't win Producer of the Year, I'll never so much as GLANCE at the noms ever again. <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>% done with the Grammys.
Beyoncé, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, U2, TSwift. POY nom for Ryan Tedder? Nahhh. And Billboard is taking about DJ Mustard getting snubbed? WTF!
The best thing about not having a 9-5 is that I no longer spend the first 3 hours of my day wondering what time is too early to go to lunch.
@AmericanAir All good. But next time I get stuck in traffic you'll hold the plane at the gate until I get there right? Goes both ways?
@AmericanAir Don't worry - not just you. Unfair in general. We buy tickets for specific dates/times and airlines just say, "Delays. Sorry".
I had almost forgotten why I don't fly @AmericanAir . Thanks for reminding me. And never an explanation - just "yeah the plane's not here."
About to leave 78 degrees in Dallas for 20 degrees in Denver. Maybe I accidentally miss my flight . . .

@Julialights_ It was so much fun! They asked me where I need to fly back to and I thought about saying SPB!
Guess who's coming home early.
I'll be back in NYC tomorrow night.
I can't tell you how happy I would be if no one ever asked me to take a picture of or for them ever again. It's the worst.
Did some walking through Vienna today and only fell in love 7 times. Pretty proud of myself. 
@Mary_L_A He did! He loved it! Went back to the States early this morning. Thank you so much!
Up early. Hour and a half of sleep. Saw some shit. Now back to bed. 
@Julialights_ and more quiet . . . 
@Julialights_ I get told that a lot. But walking the streets of Prague late at night makes me feel like I'm in Mission Impossible!
No one comes out with me and they always miss the craziest shit. Then they don't believe me the next day. I'm pretty decent at adventuring.
@ssssmth NOOO!! I'm nobody. Pay no attention to me!!

Denver is pretty. Got to walk by this on the way back to the hotel.

Anyway, love you all. We'll cross paths again eventually I hope!
@chrisdoesthings Your door guy took a 2hr nap this morning. Then came back and tried to tell me he was just using the bathroom real quick.
Fuck buses . . .
Like 4 people got off so I moved to an empty row by myself! Then some dude got on and sat next to me. FUCK. 
. . . and also I'm hungry.
The guy next to me just sneezed twice bit I didn't say bless you. <GRIMACING FACE>
Oh shit we're getting off again. I hope someone gets on or of this time for the poor bus driver's sake. Someone might snap otherwise . . .
Not 1 person has used the bathroom since I got on in LittleDetroit. I wonder if they know something I don't. I think I'm just gonna hold it.
Fucking Molly . . .
#shellneverseethis 
This bus has tile floors but carpeted ceiling. Why? You ordered carpet specifically for the ceiling? I don't see carpet anywhere else.
There's one lady who has her light on. Reading of all things. Just one light on on the whole bus. She doesn't have any friends either . . .
We just stopped in New Britain and no one got on or off. Bus driver's not making any friends. Hopefully he doesn't make that mistake again.
We're not on the highway anymore. Not sure why. Going to investigate shortly.
On the new bus in Hartford. It smells slightly better. But the people are very angry. Probably because they had to wait for us. Oops.
Pulling into Hartford now. The bus I was supposed to be on may or may not have left at 10p as scheduled. Can't wait to find out! #soexcited
@chrisdoesthings Uhhh. I mean, you don't know her. She's super hot and stuff. OK THERE IS NO LADY WHY ARE YOU EMBARRASSING ME LIKE THIS?!? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@chrisdoesthings Is it lady friendly?
Me and all my new bus friends.
Kinda dark. Sorry. 
Got earbuds blasting Rixton super loud but noones tapped me and asked what I'm listening to like in Garden State. #kindahurts #maybetooloud
Girl in front of me has a cool wallpaper. It's like one of those pictures that's super zoomed in. I think it's a leaf though. Maybe. #artsy
Did I say I was going home? That was a lie. I'm sorry. On my way back to NYC. Which is very much NOT home because I have no apartment now.
Ok I'm on. It smells funny. There was an open seat next to a girl but I didn't sit there. On to Hartford - which is kinda "Little Detroit".
Just had to put my duffle bag down because it was getting like REALLY heavy. #shoulderpain #alsoalittleneckpain
I'm live tweeting my trip back home. Ready? Ok, it's late and I'm just standing here wondering if I'm going to miss my transfer in Hartford.

Definitely the worst day in recent memory. Please. kill. me.
WHY HAVE I NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE 
Today is not the day I apologize for my drinking habits. Shrug.
@DJMirandaWright Some of my favorite tweets ever, that's all.
@DJMirandaWright 
and also @DJMirandaWright . . .
Tove Lo . . .
A follow-up: a girl texted me a pic today after she woke up - crazy hair, smeared makeup, and all. My response . . . 
@chrisdoesthings <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I immediately love girls that say 'bro'. I don't really know why . . .
FUCK YEAH. Now all we need is an absolute BLOWOUT loss for the US next.  And a Portugal shutout win would also be super swell.
Please don't make me use Logic today . . .
@sydnierob Start with 'self-referential' and go from there.

First, let me say I have nothing for or against either team. 
Rangers get 2 in the 1st, yet I'll still be amazed if they're aren't swept.
@sydnierob Bitch you spelled 'sexiest' wrong . . .
Can anyone in NYC tell me what they just wrote in the sky?! I *just* barely missed it. <CONFUSED FACE>
I'm such a gangster. 
Emphasis on the -er, [{(bitch)}] . . .
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
[{(please don't hurt me)}]
I think I'm really missing having nieces, nephews, friends' kids, or whatever around - 4 year olds are awesome. I miss being Uncle Wich.
@chrisdoesthings Yeah that 3rd, maybe 4th day growth is the roughest part for sure. Get it?! ROUGHEST? See what I did there?
@chrisdoesthings  How did it feel when they hit your chin?
@chrisdoesthings Why you be makin it sound like dis . . . 
@chrisdoesthings What were you trying to be doing? Why you be breaking the thing?
@chrisdoesthings Why is the computer off?! Did it crash?! That studio assistant should be fired. #totallyincompetent
6:30a : wrapping up a 21-hour day
10:30a : do it all over again
@Jake_Rixton Really glad I managed to get in your pants this morning. Woke up late and realized all of mine are dirty. Thanks again!!
I didn't want to lose my seat at the bar, but I really couldn't stand the mixed stench of balls and salon emanating from the guy next to me.
FOR FUCK'S SAKE ATALANTA, FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING APPLES.
Don't mind me. Just going on a quick trip back to 1999 for a couple days . . . 
Where did the Sirens live? And how many were there? We'll never know. Too bad too. Because I fucking love Sirens.
@Lewi_Rixton @Danny_Rixton oh god was that me . . .
Everyone I meet that's actually not full of shit thinks they're too cool to be friends with me - and I think that's a total load of shit.
@ItsBennyBlanco "Lost my phone a few days ago. 
- sent from my iPhone"

Going on hour 10 of pretty much continuous blasting of the mains at self-limiting level. I feel physically ill and want to hurt someone.
To say this is the rap mixtape version of Niandra LaDes &amp; Usually Just a TShirt would be 100% accurate.
If I seem a bit off, it's probably because I'm totally normal and it's hard for you to relate. That's what I tell myself.
Modern Love is the best Bowie song and if you don't agree you can go to hell.
I would Tinder, but I don't have any pictures of myself. Yes I'm serious. This one of 8-year-old me is all I got.
Well this is pretty fucking awesome . . .

Mental Noise. Not linked to anything else in particular as far as I know. Everyone's advice: "Just stop doing that." Oh ok thanks.
Sometimes my inner voice runs the same phrase on loop for like an hour at a time. That has to be a symptom of some kind of disorder . . .
Bartender just intro'd me to her friend as her "new best bar girlfriend" because she thinks I'm gay. Don't have it in me to tell her. Shrug.
twitch muscles
I SHIT YOU NOT I HAD JUST FINISHED TYPING THAT LAST TWEET BUT HAD TO WAIT TO POST BECAUSE THE GIRL I WAS REFERRING TO STARTED TALKING TO ME.
Girls with white, sleeveless, collated shirts: STOP. NO. PLEEAAASE.

Cmd+Opt+B dude, it's nap time . . .
There's nothing I miss more about living in Kansas than Dairy Queen Macho Meals.
Yes, I totally agree we jumped the gun on emoticons, considering we still can't italicize or bold.
@lukehass You only have 2 tweets &amp; 1 is about dogs smelling each other's butts . . . step it up. Not having anything to say doesn't stop ME.
&amp;TYSYC
@RixtonOfficial Who do I have to talk to to get a hi-fi cut of #MeAndMyBrokenHeart - YouTube doesn't do it justice. I want LOSLESS. .WAV.
Get Google Voice number. Have friend max out voicemail greeting w/business talk and gaps for response. Call self. Avoid talking with others.
How have I never known about this?!


Ok?
Foreign dude just asked me for directions to his hotel. I ask what the address is. He pulls out his phone and shows it to me on mapquest...
I NEED THIS.

@NoahBreakfast Come back to DT . . .
@chrisdoesthings I don't see what that would have to do with anything . . .
#MeAndMyBrokenHeart on loop. Probably forever.

Oh yeah? Really? Well if I'm not funny, then why do all of the interns tell me I'm FUCKING HILARIOUS then? Huh?
Native and HDX sound different. Why. It's the same thing they said. Now I have to spend the evening switching between TDM, HDX, and Native.
Ice skating at Riverbank Sunday evening, but no one wants to go with me. Sigh. Oh well . . .
@sydnie_rob I know - not the most ideal days, but it's first come first served. Sorry. It's policy.
@sydnie_rob So should I put you down for Wednesdays or Thursdays?
I'm glad we don't talk about audio engineering like chefs talk about entrees. That shit's dumb. Fuck those pedantic douchebags.
Holy shit. I've figured out what I want out of life. 6 beautiful girls who want to snuggle once a week, and the bed all to myself on Sunday.
@digitalismMusic Then back to NYC right? Downtown? Looking forward to it!
The top lock bottom on my phone is busted, but I'm committed to driving this bitch into the ground so . . . one minute auto-lock it is.
. . . something something Lady Gaga's ass.
never break the chain
Why aren't chatrooms a thing anymore?! I've tried a bunch but they're all empty. I was really looking forward to it too. I'm so bored.
If you're like me and munched a bunch of mushrooms an hour ago only to come across the Opening Ceremony . . .  holy mother of god amirite?!
For the record, this is when I turned off the TV and opened the laptop instead . . . 
Something missing Josh? 
Point being, show me this graph over the course of a WHOLE YEAR. Do more people watch porn on Easter or Xmas?, etc... 
Some days are better than others. 
32bit / 96k - HD I/Os set Soft Clip.
Kinda makes me want to record instruments or something I dunno. Weird.
Every Downtown session log since I moved to NYC. Somewhere between 1,300-1,500. 

Downtown Studio A 0:37-0:43. Looks pretty good!
Vocal comping. And editing. And tuning. And timing. And adding dynamics. AS GOD FUCKING INTENDED.
THE IPHONE CLOCK APP ICON SHOWS THE REAL TIME. WHAAAAT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I DON'T BOTHER ANYMORE.
Why does your comb-over look like a wicker basket?

@KayCeeEmmx #BitchesBeShorterThanMe.com
@KayCeeEmmx What are you saying?! It's not like I'm THAT short . . . Am I?
@KayCeeEmmx #6'4"Says MyFakeID
@KayCeeEmmx #OhThatsRightYoure21
@KayCeeEmmx #RaiseTheBar
@KayCeeEmmx You're right.  <CONFUSED FACE>
@KayCeeEmmx Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. We can be friends after you learn to ice skate - I have standards too you know . . .
@KayCeeEmmx OF COURSE.
Yes I'm crazy. Insane even. And I just want to get fucked and have fun too. But I have limits. I will totally walk out without saying bye.
So much for open-bar Christmas party. Working all night.
You know you drink too much when you're the only outsider to get an invited to a bar's staff Christmas party . . .
Is it me? Really? I think it's fucking awful. Am I the only one?
I've never bought a record so fast in my life.
You're never going to convince me that cooking is enjoyable/worthwhile. All this effort for something you're literally going to shit out.
40 hour day complete. Going to drink until I fall asleep at the bar.
@sydnie_rob I'll post you a picture after we wrap. It's a work of art.
New High Score in Vocal Tracking Session OCD perfection.
I'll have worked 5 consecutive sessions (38 hours straight) by the time I go to bed tonight - IF we wrap at 11p. 50/50 we go later . . .
This dude's been rap-sturbating for like 7 hours now. You'd think he'd be ready for a nap.
You want me to mix this? You give me 20 mp3 stems and ask me to mix this? MP3 STEMS? MIX THIS? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.
I would totally let a cute girl live with me for free if she'd leave leftovers in the fridge and do our laundry . . .
Edit: I can't Twitter so good.
THAT MEANS NOTHING! I WANT MY KARMA!!
I've now lost count of how many umbrellas I've given away to drunk girls on the street . . . still waiting for the karma to come back.
@sydnie_rob That I understand . . .
@sydnie_rob Maybe I don't know what we're talking about . . .
@sydnie_rob <ANGUISHED FACE>,  <STATUE OF LIBERTY><SLICE OF PIZZA><THUMBS UP SIGN>
Yeah, you know. Just had this track kickin around for a lil bit . . . 
Can't wait for 2014. I'm going to start saying No to a lot of things.
I tried to give Logic X a chance - I really did. But when I started hearing digital noise anytime I changed track height. . . that's an ⌘+Q.
Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan was so ahead of her time.
I'm happy to be back in NYC, but people are dumb as hell. Where's Sanne?  <CONFUSED FACE>
@LITW_Bunny @chrisdoesthings What are we talking about?
@SelahSue just salvaged my whole week. I can't wait to get back home.
@chrisdoesthings 
@chrisdoesthings Not until Saturday.
Yeah I guess I really do love New York.
@nicole_lina You were all busy with the MTV stuff!!
I hadn't accounted for it being too dark to work at 6p . . . I know you want things vibey, but I could do with some lamps down here.
My bedroom tonight . . . yes really. 
Bye bye The United States of America. See you in 7 days / 6 nights. Or maybe I don't come back. By choice though; not because I die there...
Think Customs will mind that I'm drunk?
@sydnie_rob <SNOWFLAKE><STATUE OF LIBERTY><AIRPLANE><SUNRISE><PALM TREE>
@matsoR So we had the speakers, they just weren't in the wall yet . . . The black cabs on the right. Also, Thistle. 
Looks like I'll have to dig out the swim shorts . . . 
Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and . . . Tim. 
Fucking Tim.
I hate when artists have the same name and you're thinking it's the one you like and then they come in . . . and it's the other one. Damn.
Never ask "what do you want?"; say "want this or this?" They feel it's their decision, but really you get to set all of the parameters.
If I just fractured my hand I'm going to be pissed.
@KayCeeEmmx   It's a hard knock life.
@sydnie_rob   . . . pizza? No, <BEER MUG> yes. Well, to be fair, more like <CLINKING BEER MUGS><CLINKING BEER MUGS><CLINKING BEER MUGS><CLINKING BEER MUGS><CLINKING BEER MUGS>.
It always freaks me out when I have the same dream for a few nights in a row. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME.
Can MixTapes please just stop being a thing? PLEASE?
The session today was so rough it made me wish I'd taken that guy up on the gay porn shoot last night. (Yes that really happened . . .)
@chrisdoesthings Huh? Did I miss something?
#MakeOutPremiere 
The meeting in the conference room could probably use a break. 
Finally the AppleTV comes in handy.
Hell yes. Working radiator in my room that I can leave off all winter if I want, and no central thermostat to battle roommates over . . .
2013 will come and go and my parents will still have a landline and no answering machine . . .
I really want to go to Disney World. Anyone? ANYONE?
@chrisdoesthings Actually I think it was the spin dip, beers, shots, and then 20 minutes of vomiting in the shower that reset me. #TMI
Finally back to my normal pooping schedule. It was a rough week.
If I really wanted to explain the recording process to strangers, I'd do Logic seminars at the Apple Store. Or teach at Full Sail.
Why is calamari either perfectly amazing or Goodyear tire? We need to standardize. This is becoming an issue.
@sydnie_rob I love you for your sarcasm. What a sense of humour!!
@sydnie_rob I'm switching it up today. Definitely your style. What key do you want it in?
@Joannaz_ @sydnie_rob Of course I am! There's so much work to do!! 
Gar(b)age Band. Why didn't I think of that?! Brilliant.
Ableton can be synced to Tools with MMC over Ethernet with latency offset in literally 6 minutes. Stop wild tracking and then spotting.
@ohkellogg Well now I look like that creepy guy. I guess I deserved it though. Lesson learned.
@ohkellogg She accepted my Friend Request this morning. Funny thing's I don't remember asking for it. Happen to know anything about that?
Most people can't pull it off, but if you were lucky enough to be born naturally gifted with it, never underestimate the power of a wink.
Unfortunately, I am not the "Bringer of the Band" . . .
@mikkyekko As many times as people have asked for that Stay piano sound, I still can't get it. Must be using the wrong mics . . .
I know I said I was definitely going home tonight, but . . .
Oh forget it. I miss my big empty bed.
Tonight I think I'll celebrate my most impressive feat - 325 consecutive months of not being a father . . .
@Spence2DaFence But my arm looks like a chicken wing . . .
It's not even midnight yet. By 2a we'll be having some fun. Why not? I've been worktup since this morning. It's almost time . . . #makeout
@Spence2DaFence Learn to love it. Going Reno 911 for Halloween.
@ItsBennyBlanco @Grimezsz Should have cranked in B. Significantly less wide. But also Genelec auto-limiters. I guess you can't win.
@ItzMeDuhmee Hmmm. Looks like the link is broken . . . Shrug.
@chrisdoesthings I can only imagine that everything at dinner tonight was followed by, "Best I've ever had in my life. Promise ya."
aaaaaaand you've lost laptop privileges.
#worktup
RIP Nation Science Foundation. I grew up on PBS. We didn't have cable. But who needs NOVA when we've got Twitter right? #shutdown
Tonight I think I'll celebrate 10 years of not having a bed time. Don't tell my mom though.
I will find out who did this . . .
You are in trouble mister. 
@Joannaz_ Neither did I - they just gave me my account back today.
@Spence2DaFence I moonlight as a bike cop.
@CASHMERECAT 
Angryneering tonight with you. I'm screaming at children on the playground right now to get myself ready. @chrisdoesthings #worktup
I wish someone would come to the studio and have a couple beers with me while I wait for Wyatt to not come back.
