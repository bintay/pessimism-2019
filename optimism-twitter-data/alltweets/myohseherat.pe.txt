If he decided to lie and use one of my friends' name to cover it, then why did he lied? What's wrong with telling the truth?
Honestly i can't let this matter slide that easily.
He doesn't have an instagram account. Pikah didn't tell him or any other guy in our class. But where the actual fuck did he know about it??!
That actually hurts you know <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Did he actually lied to me? I'm thinking long about this.
Because it involves people.

Never say words that you yourself cannot hold onto. Because in the end, if he really leave us, you'll be as messed up as i am, the mere fan.
Never talk like you know what he felt. Never talk like you knew him too well to predict his feelings when in fact you too are just a fan.

Okay. I'm off now. Have a nice day you guys <WAVING HAND SIGN>

I've unfollowed some people that seemed too quiet these few months. I'm sorry.
I need to start packing my bag weyy. I'm going back tomorrow morning. But first, i need to eat and take my medication <ANGUISHED FACE>
People can start shipping me with typo you know. We've got that love-hate relationship.
Stfu typo
I've concluded that i can't study at home. Too much distraction. I can only study at campus where there's jothing to distract me <SMIRKING FACE>
I made a good decision to come back early. Lol i sgould really study you know
People are struggling with exams now at my college but here i am, still at home lazing around.
I've spread all my books on my study table at home last night. But i wentvto tumblr and stumble on some baekhyun and sehun's tags. Preach!
I think i'm loving this baek's birthday icon <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
It's been 11 hours since i last took my medication. The doctor said i must take it every 8 hours. Lol screw me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
How not to make a typo.

Someone should really write about this and sell it to me.
I'm getting used to baek's birthday icon now
I promise i won't be a rotten potato once i'm in campus. I will study hard mybhead will split.
Mom texted me, asking me to do the laundry........ i woke up aj hour later lol <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Childhood memories.....
The last thing i remembered about english music was justin bieber before i decided to corner my path to super junior &amp; then kpop as a whole
Suddenly i get this feeling to trace back Blue. And suddenly i found 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys.... damn i miss all these guys
That era is when music was the realest of all. You can't buy music like that nowadays.
Honestly, kpop is nothing in my life before i met super junior. I mostly jammed to those british boy bands when i was little
If you ever jammed to Westlife, Blue, 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys, you all are my baes ♡♡♡♡
@NaddyNadia_ yes! Of couse!!!! Don't forget to bring your unicorn~~~ i'llbbring sehuna ahjumma with me <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@NaddyNadia_ aaaaaah... hahahaha... tu lah... lagi pun nak exam dah kan... kalo keluar pun rasa mcm restrained je...
@NaddyNadia_ yes, currently i am leaving for study week. Why?
@NaddyNadia_ well, i'm fine about everything. As ling as the olace we choose i can reach with public transports.....
@NaddyNadia_ same!! But mine will be on the 13th.... ahhh!!! Bila??? I don't know bout you??
@NaddyNadia_ ahhhh.... are you have finals soon? Me? I'll live as long as exo are living as well <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Awwww i miss you tooo.... you were all too quite lately.... where have you been?  
I feel ashamed with all the typos i've been making.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> yeah, humans crave for them. The creepy part of being them, that is. Lol poor little things they are 
Awww this is so...... i miss sehuna ahjumma icon alreadyyyyy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
There.... better <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Weh.... hijau dia sakit mata <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> tukar lahh
Butbin the mean time, in conjunction to baekhyjn's birthday, i'm changing to one of the icons his fansite has given...
Been thinking of changing. But that's not finalized yet.....
Because i think i'm the only one that have the heart to use this pic as my icon <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
<NORTH WEST ARROW> this icon have been waaaaaay too long with me. But i like it since i love sehuna ahjumma......
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> eyyy, we have the same bias.... but i'm going for baekhyun instead of D.O <VICTORY HAND> 
Everything that is byun baekhyun is cute i.............
I like these icons better 
Why don't we stick to just one fansite's self-made icon instead?? That'll be much easier and less arguments
Behold.... the byun-liner <LIPSTICK> 
You did..?????  
Let it go~~~~~
Awak pon pegi lah kroh krohh sana~~~ 
Sheeeeettt..... it was just 0.0001 sec when i glanced over and noticed i made a typo and then the tweet was posted. Dayum!
There is something wrong with taehyung that's need to fix. But i don't kniw what.
At least awak belajar english sem ni... english saya dah lama mereput ever since ept last sem  
I want to be a panda. No. I want a panda. Yes. Give me a panda.
I should read more. My vocabs are limited.
It's not every day you find me like a rotten potato. I'm only a rotten potato when i'm at home lol
Let me rot like a potato while i'm still home.

My first time noticing baekhyun wearing a button down with the first button popped up. Damn baek <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> 
Wtf with this asia's got talent show? Don't we show enough talent with just kpop?
What is wrong with me these days? If i eat something slightly weird, i'd get diarrhea. And then i'd feel like vomitting.
I can't smell food now..... it makes me feel so sick and felt like vomitting.

I don't know what's going on in her head but i hope she made a wise decision. Once you left a good friend, you'd never get their replacement
I have a thought about this. About her, wanting to cut off all of us from her life so that she could start afresh
So she left the group as well.....

So.... who won today on inkigayo?
But turned out they perfirmed CMB but wasn't nominated as winners. That's quite sad.
Ahhh... now i understand... yesterday people were fussing about exo competing at inkigayo with exodus instead of CMB
EXO will be performing CallMeBaby.
they are not nominated because they got triple crown last week 
Did exo win today on inkigayo? Why haven't anyone say a thing about this?
Feeling so fucking sick rn

Wait wait wait... if you delete your ig acc then it says user is bla bla bla but on xiumin's ig it only says no photos or videos post
Why did xiumin delete his photos on ig????
I think i really need to go back home. Just now i was doubting my decision but now, going back is a priority.
I'm here you guys, i'm here to share your sadness. We are one, aren't we?
What? What? WHAT??? WHAT'S WITH 11:11????

I'm not being selfish but things were being dragged day by day. It's about time tao comes out and state where he stands.
Whether this is another shitty rumour from sina or tao still playing april fool, i hope tao has fully recovered so that he can fix this prob
But honestly, things have been very suspicious lately. I'm not even surprised.
Does everyone has a weibo for that matter? Because my dad doesn't have one. And i don't too.

Bangtan is humble. The fans making fake charts so that it seems like  they're topping it doesn't tally with the boys' personality.

But exo is a priority <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Because right now, with finals nearing and all project reports need to be submitted, i have no time for things that aren't my priority
My ability to listen to people are decreasing day by day. I hate listening to things that aren't worth my time
So i know you're good at this and that but you know what? I'm better at other things than you too so stop bragging.
Different people have different ability. It irks me when someone tryna differentiate their abilities with mine.

Maaf lagi sekali tapi #sorrynotsorry
I swear malaysians complain too much without even thinking about the pros and cons of the decision. Try to think for a while and reflect.
Jakim tidak bersalah. Benda betul, memang patut dilaksanakan pun. Asif ya, saya lagi pentingkan agama.
Ehemmmmm. Jangan lah ada yg judge aku pulak lepas ni.
I don't really care what they wanted to do. If it's for the good, then it should be enforced. Islam is perfect in every way it could have.
Don't blame jakim for what you like. They're doing this for good. Be a muslim by your heart, not only by your name.

Sehun's voice aren't as deep as chanyeols but it can go lower that what chanyeol could manage.... odg what is this feeling
As far as i know, sehun is ranked to have the lowest vocal among exo and i think i like it that way

OTHER MEMBER'S REACTION 
People aren't replying my texts
Does every sehun stan stans chanyeol as a side and vice versa? Does the ChanHun system actually exist in our fandom?
I could feel the sore throat creeping up my trachea <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
sunny: anyone love to be DJ?
suho: i would love to do it,but i recommend chanyeol
chanyeol: in the movie,i had a few scenes and i must cry and thats so hardd 
@CHIYOgalaxy the song was literally flat. No emotions, no beats, no nothing. They could've be better if sm's focusing on one group at a time
@nazaeqin 
FINALLY!!!!!
Yaaaaaasssss i know how the quote thing works
Hmmm 
@CHIYOgalaxy something seems wrong with their new song... idk what but i was expecting something more
The fuck i just mentioned someone i don't even know and say nothing. I am so sorry
