“If you were to write a petition to God right now, what would it say?”
“Where did you get the idea you aren’t allowed to petition the universe with prayer? You are part of this universe.
You’re a constituent—you have every entitlement to participate in the actions of the universe, and tho let your feeling be known.
So put your opinion out there. Make your case. Believe me—it will at least be taken into consideration.”

SEE YOU ALL ON THE 13TH! <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
