@ibarrpao me
how the hell am i supposed to lay in bed and use this pocket sized charger
RIP to my 10 ft charger u will be missed.
How can u possibly argue that a rich person can't easily get away with breaking the law rather than a poor or middle class person.
@hoezayismyname almost seems like the cops are doing it on purpose. (Of course not all but u get me)
@hoezayismyname it escalates to worse things but they aren't being televised. It's not just America that's bad. It's every where and it
@hoezayismyname countries won't tolerate behavior like that. But it has occurred of people going against their prohibitions and
@hoezayismyname but it isn't worse here. It's sad that people have to riot in order to try and make a change. Like you said many other
@hoezayismyname sadly racism will never die. Even in Mexico colorist exists.
@hoezayismyname With so many incidents that has happened I doubt that it's the issue. It's about letting it happen over and over again,
@hoezayismyname has happened in other places but they are not being televised. Other countries have gone against their "prohibitions" that's
@hoezayismyname In Acapulco people are causing chaos because of the missing students. It's pretty bad, what is happening in Baltimore
"Only in America it would be this bad" is probably the most ignorant thing i've heard all day.
Sad that there has to be riots and chaos in order to speak up, yet nothing ever changes.
It's kind of sad how nothing is done even though the incidents keep escalating.

@FrancoXaviG He got such a good score on his act I'm so proud!! &amp; ooo nice, I've heard of that one also <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Maybe because I miss Geezy and Val
Feelin a lil downy
@FrancoXaviG I know! He got in that one and he really likes it, he's going to graduate next year. Which one do you go to <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Morton is very lenient if you think about it
I really don't mind the work at school what so ever, I actually like it, it's just that I hate routines w a passion.
@FrancoXaviG I kinda wish I would of listened to my dad bc he would of put me in Muchin or Northside w my cousin danny <CRYING FACE> &amp; damn good job <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@FrancoXaviG Prep schools give out sm work dude bless your soul <CONFUSED FACE>
The work isn't hard at all compared to other schools, especially prep schools.
School isn't hard at all, it's just exhausting doing the same routine every single day.

Paola and I love to annoy Val
@Valeria_orozco8 pues su mama es ortho @ibarrpao
@posibabe_ Yeah I didn't that's why I took it as an offense because I thought it meant something else
@posibabe_ then the other person told the tweet was referring to non binary people and trans men
@posibabe_ I thought the tweet meant that they don't fall under "that" category just bc they are trans. Which I thought it was rude,
@posibabe_ towards trans women that identify themselves as woman, and not trans men since they identify themselves as a male.
@posibabe_ The other person understood so it's your problem if you didn't. Like I said, I found it disrespectful bc i thought the tweet was
@posibabe_ since you're already reading the other tweets, correct? :)
@posibabe_ I'm pretty sure you're two days late on that so i'm not wasting my time explaining what i thought the tweet meant.
I'm just going to bite my tongue lmao
Hahaha
Can we leave already
Why does the school randomly decide to unblock twitter and snapchat lol

@josepedroza60 yeah you spoiled creatine having ass little boy
@delietful thanks you too, at least you explained the tweet to me instead of blocking lmao
I agree if you have the money, to surprise the kid once in a while but never raise them to think they are superior to others bc of that.
I feel bad for their parents' skills on raising kids because now they have such disgusting spoiled ass kids lol.
@delietful Yeah, honestly at first I thought the tweet was towards trans woman so I got annoyed because they should be considered woman.
@ChloePebbles HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU HOT ASS GIRL I LOVE YOU I HOPE YOU HAD AN AMAING DAY AND GET A BUNCH OF "JOBS" IN RETURN OK <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE><SPARKLING HEART>
@Alejandroo__20 ale ale alejandro
@delietful I don't think it was, and if you don't agree with me then that's your opinion. Some agreed with me, and some agreed w you.
Fav for Barrington (Right) 
@delietful she should of explained that in her tweet because it made no sense and I was bot the only one who had that wtf reaction
@bugbae Tell me when I denied that I wasn't lmao. I asked why you got offended.
@delietful I didn't like how she was excluding them out, so all of a sudden they're different from women but they still go through it all.
@delietful and what I meant is that they shouldn't be labeled different, if they want to be seen as woman then they should.
@bugbae and im sure that they want to be looked as a woman not those other disrespectful labels
@bugbae  and Im sure transexuals dont want to be classified as "trannys" or "men" correct? They want their desired gender to be respected
@bugbae if you're not a girl then why did you take it as an offense
@bugbae It means your tweet makes no sense like idk how you're trying to prove that stuff is not specific to women
Valeria and I are devious
There's seriously not enough time in the day

@Alejandroo__20 strech your calfs a lot!! Tomorrow, go after practice so you can use this thing he uses to stretch your calfs :-)
@Alejandroo__20 hmm you probably need shoes with more support for the sole
@Alejandroo__20 Wait you're feeling pain in your calf muscle??
It's funny when people think they're being so secretive about who they tweet about but it's so obvious lol
@Alejandroo__20 You didn't tell him to roll you out? :(
