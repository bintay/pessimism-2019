Someone please start an Adult in a YA Novel parody account
@elloecho Pretty sure we're only allowed to tell them that they is kind, they is smart, they is important.
@elloecho But don't you know that brown women aren't allowed to talk back to respected white men in the biz? Didn't you get the memo?
@jeantt_solo @RebeccaSchinsky SQUEEEEEEE
@jeantt_solo @RebeccaSchinsky PICS
When bros be like no that book is actually super feminist, you just don't UNDERSTAND it 
@catagator @brennacgray!
@KarenaFagan JANET MOCK IS A GOLDEN GODDESS
@KarenaFagan YESSSS
@Anthelmintics_ @0xabad1dea Ohhh I had twins too! Craziest 6 months of my life. ANY leave would've been awesome.
I hope the state of sex ed is awesome when my kids are teens but if it's not I'm giving them this book, especially if they're straight
@RebeccaSchinsky don't think I didn't giggle at that when I typed it
The hymen chapter in COME AS YOU ARE alone is worth the book's price of entry, ladies (and, well, everyone)
@Anthelmintics_ @0xabad1dea PSH I help run a start-up: I AM a job creator
@malk_zameth No, we didn't. We got some free birth control, but that's all.
I am educated and powerful and logical, but obviously this teen is who should be in charge b/c reasons. -adults in YA
For Mother's Day I want federally mandated maternity leave just like every country of the developed world instead of bullshit platitudes
Pork and whiskey. #onbrand 
Cleaning books, cookbooks, prayer journals have ladies though! 16/ 37 for moms 
@thebooksluts I should totes go sit in the romance section that's apparently the only place we're allowed and also knitting mysteries
18/55 no really say it again 
Only 5/33 are by women but tell me more about how women are taking over bookstores 
Back this Kickstarter to bring Little Free Libraries to urban and rural book deserts: 
@capmorrow1 @mayarodale @BookRiot YES
So I've been putzing with the Libib app for a few weeks and I am quite pro.
@GeekElite What what I meant the band what did I do what
@emilygatlin um yes
@chbooksdc 
@morebookstofind It's so great! It's DANGEROUS BOOK FOR GIRLS by Maya Rodale
@RebeccaSchinsky @thejeffoneal he printed out the tweet and framed it
After I finish this history of romance novels I'm going to start COME AS YOU ARE so basically men to the left
@thejeffoneal I would never come out from under the rock where I lived
JKR FOR THE BURN 
@tiffanyreisz HA that's a good point
@pseudocinephile Why is he so J Depp though
I love the Civil Wars but their name is so cringey. 
@ebookclassics @LauraTFrey @bookrageous YESSSSS
@rinceya HOW HAVE I NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE?
of COURSE he cheated 
I have my first conference call as a volunteer for @diversebooks today and I am FANGIRLING HARD
@arlenefinnigan Sure! A romance novel is just a novel about a central relationship that has a happy/optimistic ending
@skrishna maybe I deleted that and rewrote it, maybe I didn't
YOU DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH, FOLKS
Here's a real thing: our romance posts get some shit comments, but they also get big traffic. People snark, but they're interested.
I see I'm going to have to pull out my pink ban hammer today. I've named it Romance Novels Are More Feminist Than You (it's a long name)
Gonna be at BEA? Come to the @bookrageous Bash and meet Megan Abbott and DJ Older and drink things: 
@chbooksdc QUIET YOU WE ARE VERY DEMURE AND LADYLIKE @skrishna
That time @skrishna and I went to the @penfaulkner awards and BURNED IT DOWN aka had a lovely time: 
the words "[insert title] slam poem goes viral" just make me so happy
@BumblingMiranda @mayarodale @BookRiot Ha! I don't mind them, but hey, that's what ereaders are for ;)
So happy to have @mayarodale on @BookRiot today talking about feminist romance novels: 
...I'd read that so fast 
Haven't been this happy to see a Friday in a hot minute
Final pass on applications. HEERRREE WEE GOOOO *dives*
@HelloCVH maxi dress with ballet flats &lt;---what I live in from June-September
This, pretty much. 
@tiffanyreisz It's like magic! Tells you so much about them!
@bkshelvesofdoom Yes! And you have to be widely read enough to have something in your pocket for whatever their answer is.
@leonicka Wut.
The most useful sentence you'll ever have when making book recommendations is "what's the last book you read that you loved?"
@Sea_Bunker what did Nora every do to you Sean JEEZ
@Sea_Bunker There are just so many other also sucky books to yell about if you want to yell at people
@BWRBooks @RebeccaSchinsky BR's Twitter feed. Hella heavy convo happening and I haven't had lunch yet.
@hwheaties @RebeccaSchinsky You're saying all the things I can't say from a work account :)
@RebeccaSchinsky I get exhausted just MONITORING THE CONVERSATION like shhhh...eat a pastry. It's fine. Everything is fine.
(also it's 2015 if you're still talking about how Twilight has Damaged the Kiddos you need to srsly move on)
Must be so exhausting to appoint yourself Book Police Over What Everyone Else Reads
@Drunk_Austen Probably not for most places, but for the Riot it's a-OK
.@leonicka is on a pretty righteous rant about libraries right now and I won't retweet it all b/c I love you guys, just go read it.
@hwheaties I say "get in loser we're going shopping" to myself, my husband, anyone who is around
@hwheaties NONE for mother fuckin' Gretchen Weiners. (I really like her though)
I love applications that are like "I would be a good fit for Book Riot because I am fucking awesome." YES YOU ARE. YOU GO GLEN COCO.
@RebeccaSchinsky @brennacgray @lauraifyoudare @jennIRL (which is to say, they are amazing and wonderful and I will never stop wearing them)
@RebeccaSchinsky @brennacgray @lauraifyoudare @jennIRL As a person w/ the body of a hippy 10 year old boy, they make me look hella curvy.
@BrandyLJensen pretend that said THEIR recent kickstarter *drinks more coffee*
@BrandyLJensen -people who just start them themselves are doing it in neighborhoods that don't really need them. But they're nice!
@BrandyLJensen That's a totally fair point. I like that they're recent Kickstarter is about putting LFLs in urban/rural book deserts, but-
Excellent points about why we need a Black Widow movie: 
@downshayfarm independent bookstore
@sarahmaclean Ally McBeal is the literal worst
@fuggirls I'm fascinated by her lipstick

@brennacgray @triceratops23 @jadoogan but...it's...butter...?
@triceratops23 @brennacgray @jadoogan I...have so many questions
@LadyT_TNT I don't...get it
@brennacgray @jadoogan Right! And it says "very little fruit" which...fruit?? Is the best????
@jadoogan I don't KNOW! I don't get it!
@NyashaJunior No days! I saw all the rules and went running away.
You can't eat lentils on the Whole 30 what kind of pseudo science sorcery is this
Freshly sautéed garlic is the motherfuckin business
@rivercityreadin Oh my God, it would in INSTANT.
@shainareads that is the conclusion I am coming to as I think out loud on Twitter, lulz
@rivercityreadin I was so mad. I mean I get it, she has to say that. But it's not right.
@rivercityreadin When we were house hunting our realtor showed us houses in Church Hill &amp; was like "of course, there's private schools."
We want to keep putting our money towards what makes us comfortable &amp; to feel ok about it we reframe it as noble/charitable. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
-don't want to "sacrifice" our own (mostly white) kids by sending them there and getting involved.
Like, we want libraries around but we don't want to go ourselves and hang out with the poor folk. We want great public schools, but we-
-to the public school and do your fundraising effort THERE. That's not a great analogy. Or maybe it is. I'm parsing.
-fundraisers to benefit their rich school and I'm like...ok, but while you're gentrifying that neighborhood why don't you send your kids-
The indie/library thing has me also thinking (b/c my kids will go to school soon) about friends w/ kids in private school who do-
@BWRBooks I could support my county library system on my late fees but I ain't mad
@runwithskizzers @brennacgray @catagator Right right. Always wondered why they don't get yelled at like AMZN does. That's why!
@BWRBooks @runwithskizzers @brennacgray @catagator It's not A/B, I just want the "moral" argument reassigned from indies to libraries.
@runwithskizzers @brennacgray @catagator Do other retailers who deeply discount (like Costco- sooo cheap, the books) eat that cost like AMZ?
@runwithskizzers @brennacgray @catagator You're not being combative!
Y'all we can do both you know you can read a book from the library pay your $0.50 late fee and then go buy the thing at an indie
@runwithskizzers @brennacgray @catagator yesssss excellent very good
@MorganTheScribe Please do and please live tweet this experience
@adamhoward do it!
@adamhoward I support this idea
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray Like, just one. JUUUSSTTT the one.
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray I agree, I just once want an article that's like "Amazon is lame, so let's all go to the library!"
@adamhoward Hmmm do you mean on Twitter? I don't follow many historians tbh
@jeffzentner go sit over there and think about what you've done
@jeffzentner Jeff.
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray (course, I'd love to do both and try to do both)
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray Yeah, I guess at the end of the day it's about saving a business I love vs. saving...everyone
If my indie closes, I think egads, publishing is sinking. If my library closes, I think well shit we're all fucked now.
@nebrinkley YEAH! That's what I was trying to articulate, thank you, thank you
Good way to put it! 
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray -support a specific business. What about...Target? Costco? Or the library? Or etc, ya know
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray I think there's a diff b/t calling out Amazon and insisting that everyone has a responsibility to-
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray -them as charities that deserve patronage just cause they exist. Or something.
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray That's totally true, and I want indies to stay around forevskis. I just don't like the framing of-
I don't want indies to go away. But more than that, I want libraries to have better funding? I dunno.
I love my indie (I used to work there!), but I guess I don't see them as ESSENTIAL like I see libraries as REALLY FUCKING ESSENTIAL.
@BHDesker Yes!
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray (also, the framing it like it's NOBLE to shop at indies instead of a business thing irritates me)
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray -bookish media or bloggers or whatever go on about that instead of, say, literacy, I get 0_o
@runwithskizzers @catagator @brennacgray yeah I know, I just think about like...the NYT (or wherever) isn't dependent on indies, so when-
@Kw33n5uzicus @biblioteq_tress @catagator WHAT REALLY?
@biblioteq_tress @catagator that's a good point right there
@brennacgray @catagator well we get really pissy when parents challenge books in libraries, so that's our good deed I guess
@brennacgray @catagator -be a thing to watch.
@brennacgray @catagator I'm just over here like, man, if publishing people dedicated as much energy to THIS as they do to THAT, that would-
@GeekElite all your hot n now are belong to us
@catagator And if that nice indie bookseller sees me evangelizing for indies online, they'll handsell my book more, maybe?
@catagator And they'd have to give the book back. Which is super-bad, I guess? Cause you can't ALSO go buy it IN ADDITION. (?)
There it is. 
@catagator ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Genuinely asking. I get scoffy at the idea that I'm bettering the state of lit by shopping at an indie, but libraries? That's real, innit?
What would happen if we turned our think pieces about our "responsibility" to shop at indies into a "responsibility" to use the library
@HelenMcClory Hooray!
"We laugh about Fabio’s very fitted breeches instead of asking who is watching the children or cooking..." 
Of course my favorite part of Bitch Planet #4 is the letter in the back about NC tattoos.
@pseudocinephile RIGHT? And the shirt is 4T. Like, no 4 year old cares about girls vs. boys. My kid LOVES girl superheroes. UUGHHH
@pseudocinephile Yeah and the shirt he has has some X-Men on it, not just Avengers...but no female X-Men. No Storm, Jane Grey...
@pseudocinephile @Marvel yeah that's not going to work for my 4 year old lulz
@pseudocinephile @Marvel ehmehgerd *dies*
I mean I'm certainly not going to let him wear it again. And we've had a chat about how girls are heroes, too. I'm just pissed. @Marvel
In which I realize a @marvel shirt given to my kid doesn't have any women on it and now I don't know… 
@miss_hellion It seemed like there was nothing that could satisfy her, no one was good enough or made her happy.
@miss_hellion So I'm listening to it now &amp; I agree about Ifem- I did NOT like her. But I still liked the book somehow? But she's snooty.
@ClaireLyman @thejeffoneal Yeah I liked that b/c you get such a rounded rec list
@HogarthBooks A+ GIF usage, Hogarth!
@thejeffoneal So funny! Didn't have that issue with Kelly- she'd knock 'em down and drag 'em out.

@BrandyLJensen I think it's because these works are so IMPORTANT to us, and if they're important to US then they must be important to-
dat cover 
@djolder AHHHHHHHHH GIMME
@BrandyLJensen I don't think I've had it since I read Steinbeck in 11th grade!
@baileymichelle It was for my book club too and now I'm all nervous about how this discussion is going to go
@miss_hellion Well now I HAVE to listen to it!
@balletbookworm Ha! I don't think that's going to happen. She seems pretty done.
@miss_hellion Nooooo *melts, dies*
@brianamford I heard! With Lupita. I hope it happens I hope I hope I hope
@brianamford I LOVED IT. I AM OBSESSED WITH IT.
I've had that reaction I haven't had to a book since I was a teenager: I will take it personally when people don't like it.
Well I finally finished AMERICANAH and look I guess I don't ever have to read anything else ever again so see you guys on the other side
@e_walk9 THE FAIR FIGHT
Great interview from indie bookstore owner about how to sell diverse books: 
@kylesburk I mean who doesn't like a little fear for their life with their afternoon delight?
@kylesburk Hey now, I am frequently the latter and I must protest (and could not do so from my work account). I PROTEST. Ahem.
@sethw THANK YOU. Do I need to teach you how to make Google alerts, people?
@lauraifyoudare Yessss forever and ever amen
@librarythingtim For that I sincerely apologize b/c it is the actual worst
@librarythingtim Basically, this: 
@librarythingtim Noo Adam Levine is less sweet boy band, more awful dirty frat guy. That, + @GuyInYourMFA
@a_more11 THAT IS AMAZING
@paul_haine that is straight out of my nightmares
@librarythingtim Something like a cross between that guy from Maroon 5 and an MFA student
@NyashaJunior It's SO great and I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner!
It's hard to care what a fedora monster thinks about you when you remember that you helped change a classroom, made a teen feel better, etc.

Reader poll time! Where did you get the last book you read?  
Seconded- I loved it. 
.@RebeccaSchinsky frexts me but it's  '90s hip-hop lyrics 
@homebtwnpages @krisandryshak @kerryamchugh But my threshold of interesting/likable is weird. YMMV!
@homebtwnpages @krisandryshak @kerryamchugh I just...didn't find the character interesting enough to overcome how much I disliked her.
@notsowiseowl It would make sense for R. She could gather her cape under her in the truck, like a yellow nest of glory
@krisandryshak @homebtwnpages @kerryamchugh ME EITHER *runs away*
How did they transport it? Does she have extra seats reserved? What if she has to pee?
I have logistical questions. How heavy is Rihanna's cape? How is it staying closed? Is it welded together at the front?
@jeantt_solo HERE FOR IT
pipersbooknook said: How do you deal with gender roles when it comes to your two boys? 
Rihanna is the bright golden sun around which we all rotate

Just me, a bottle of pinot, and 1,600 applications
@catagator I've totally crossed over into just feeling pity for those people, which I think makes them angrier than all my other responses.

All done! Thanks for tolerating my live tweets, book folk. 
@Cuddlebuggery well TECHNICALLY it's at Sixth and I
@Cuddlebuggery ...
"When I wrote PARADISE I was SOO impressed with myself."
"I think human beings are moving a little closer to their best selves."
"I don't mean the work is only for African-Americans. It's just getting rid of that little critic. Tolstoy didn't write for me, I love him."
"I write deliberately, carefully, dedicatedly without the white gaze."
"I never lived in a black neighborhood. I lived in a steel town. What we all were was poor."
Bah, question lines are long. Don't think I'll make it.
"I know you have been told all your life to write what you know. But I'm telling you now you don't know anything."
@Cuddlebuggery YES I AM AT A SIGNING
@fuzzytypewriter "are you sure your book didn't actually mean this other thing?"
The Bluest Eye was rejected 12 times before she found a publisher
@thejeffoneal which is kind of a riddle answer
@thejeffoneal she was actually just asked that and she said "the acquisition of knowledge"
Twitter she's taking questions. Send yours to me and I'll see if I can ask one.
"You could replace the car [destroyed in riots], but the child, the boy, the man, is DEAD."
"The police are...strikingly cowardly. It's just amazing. You see someone running away and you say, I fear for my life?"
"Now there is video tape. Now there is conversation. Now there is outrage."
Michele is asking about Baltimore and the effect of constantly seeing via social media violence against black men
Now she's talking about how clinical, pornographic sex scenes put her to sleep.
@fuzzytypewriter I can't hear you over my quiet sobbing
"I wish the sound of the text was as seductive to the reader as it is to me."
She just explained the plot of Beloved in 30 seconds and destroyed all the papers I wrote about it in high school.
Toni asked for a typewriter for Christmas.
"I can always tell when my students created on a computer...you can feel the puffery." ToMo handwrites w/ a pencil on a yellow pad.
The original title of God Help the Child was THE WRATH OF CHILDREN
"Don't give me that divorced, single mother, black stuff. I'm head of household."
Toni tells an anecdote about finding out a male coworker w/ her same job made more $ than her, so she demanded a raise from her male boss.
She just spoiled the book's ending for like 600 people. Toni gives no fucks.
"Race doesn't exist. There's the human race, period. And then there's racism, which we invent." #tonipreaches
She's talking about how she's avoided writing about modern times b/c she doesn't relate to it. "But what hasn't changed...is color."
Toni Morrison giggles incredulously at her characters' foibles as if they're real people she lovingly tolerates
"We all know we're in for a special evening. It feels appropriate that we're in a sanctuary." Michele Norris says what we're all thinking.
YOU GUYS 
I am in the same building as Toni Morrison rn so

@Backlist_Books 
@_jeremiahn @JohanssonShreds Jesus be like 
Ernest Cline's new book is on edelweiss this is not a drill
@mwlinder99 oh he didn't write the books, they're just books he's liked about dealing with whining
@BWRBooks Absolutely yes A+
@librarythingtim I kinda love it
Ordering parenting books recommended by Wil Wheaton is this what a singularity feels like
@inglenook_lou Yay!
New book tote is tote-y! 
@balletbookworm that is hella metal
TIL that Emily Bronte had a bull mastiff and that makes me like her a little more
Welll this is horrifying 
Dr. Pulaski is awful tho 
@maddiemuses And they're so great for people with vision problems. GAH. Irritating.
@CarolinePruett I don't know but I am just rolling on the floor making sounds right now
Oh look another think piece about how evil ebooks are in case you were wondering this is actually 2009
#awkward  
@bobbymathews Acccuurratteeeee
@BWRBooks @SciHousewife Sometimes I want to sit on a street corner and yell SOME OF US ARE VERY NICE I'M SORRY FOR THE REST
@bobbymathews I AM HAVING A MORNING I TELL YOU WHAT
@triceratops23 Exactly. Like, there is not a group it's MORE harsh towards.
@TLT16 That's an excellent way to put it.
@TLT16 YESSS. But the church seems to think righteous anger only applies to getting mad when a Democrat wins an election these days.
&lt;/endrant&gt; *spit-shines pulpit, leaves*
Someone out there might care about how getting called out for hypocrisy hurts your fee fees, but it isn't me and it certainly isn't God
When other Christians tone police me I get a bit "sorry but did you skip that part where Jesus flipped the tables and yelled or nah"
@Bluebookballoon god no
Men explain Christianity to me
@ZachAmes Yeah, take your tone policing right on back to wherever you came from, bro.
@ZachAmes will call out their bullshit when I see it.
@ZachAmes FIRST of all, you don't know anything about what I have or have not done for people in poverty. SECONDLY, SBs are my tribe, and I
@ZachAmes are you srsly #notallsouthernbaptists ing me right now
@KatzanovaFknstn UGGHGHHGHGHGH *explodes*
@ZachAmes Calling them out IS doing something.
@HugoDraxJr It's both that and tiny backwoods Southern Baptists (these are FB people from my high school)
If you can't find an ounce of compassion for an entire community in poverty and yet you go to church on Sunday you might be a garbage person
If you need me I'll be breaking bad on people who call themselves Christians and joke about running protestors over with tanks
@rick_conners Whatever. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@rick_conners -conservative base. Just b/c he says something doesn't make it rational.
@rick_conners Justice Roberts is a dingus using whatever mental leaps he can to be on the right side of history w/out betraying his-
@rick_conners You're trying super hard (like, for several days) to make a point that can't be made. Let it goooooo
@rick_conners What are you talking about? LGBTQ discrimination is not sexism.
@rick_conners @saladinahmed Neither is a woman's marriage to a woman.
I love how many folks I follow have Patreons now. It's like our own little SJW digital middle-class commune.
@caranicoletti I'd never even NOTICED how snooty the other characters were to her. EAT. THAT. SUNDAE GURL.

Something I've learned in going through applications is that book people make the BEST sex puns

@jeffzentner I support this message.
I'll just be over here throwing copies of MEN WE REAPED at every person who says the word "thug" in my company this week. Hard.

@adrianovaroli @the_author_ ...??
@tiffanyreisz I am suspicious but intrigued
I mean talk to a 3 year old who hasn't been trained to function in society yet and you're talking to an amoral sociopath
"But people are fundamentally good" gets auto-side-eye from me- have you actually MET any people or nah
@sparrowpost awww yis
Where does the idea that humans are fundamentally good (WAS IT THE ROMANTICS) come from b/c we are actually self-centered primates so
@shainareads @kerryamchugh last time I 'thoned I bought maybe a whole basket of cheese from Trader Joe's. It was the business.

@goodmadreads @BookRiot @RebeccaSchinsky AHHH! Thanks so much!
(And I've just started going through them and haven't read any from guys yet I'M SURE YOURS ARE AWESOME TOO OK)
Love how often I'm going "damn this woman is goooddddd" while going through these applications. LADIES. You're so talented.
@QuelleBooks He seems the most grown up/emotionally secure of the bunch, which always gets me.
@sparrowpost OH my Lordy. I want this. I WANT IT. It's gotta be fanficed out there somewhere.
@Jess_Plummer the worst
@Meryl_Kate WANTZ IT
@balletbookworm YES and Knightley is so condescending blech
@balletbookworm Wentworth 4 Lyfe, boo Darcy
This is objective.
Ok but it goes Wentworth &gt; Tilney &gt; Colonel Brandon &gt; Darcy &gt; Knightley &gt; Ferrars &gt; Bertram, who is the actual worst
@TheJennJenn The shelter guys said that. That no one would even look at her, but that she was the nicest one there, esp. w/ small kids.
@readingtheend @kerryamchugh BAHAHA. That dog is doing it right.
@KatWithSword YES they are so randomly protective of anything smaller than they are. Squirrels! She just wants to adopt you, squirrels!
@NamasteRead @brokeandbookish THANK YOU ugh so irritated right now.
@kerryamchugh Even my mom was like Y U DO THAT and I was like...cause she's adorbs? Get over ittttt
@jennbookshelves She's SO nice. SHE JUST WANTS TO LOVE YOU, NEIGHBORS
@QuetaAuthor He would sleep under the stairs.
@KatWithSword THANK YOU. She is very sweet! She even LOOKS like she's smiling all the time.
@skrishna The dog owning ones would talk to me before when I walked our hound, but now...not so much.
I adopted a pit bull and now my neighbors don't like me.
@sly_wit how do you get to be more of an American author than by being a citizen?

Hot Topic is whatever, but for real I'd wear all of this (esp. that Loki dress) 
@FountainBkstore Hey if you BRING the bells, I will wear the bells
@_jeremiahn I like how my response was ACK NO WHY and yours was like YAY WHEE FUN
WHOA THERE GATTACA

@yasminlibrarian YES! It's so rad.
@itsavolcano IT IS THE GREATEST
@BWRBooks Oh yeah. It's boss.
I went through the library drive-through to pick up a book and the librarian gave my dog a treat. LIBRARIANS. Y U SO CHARMING.
@estellasrevenge Oh hell to the NO
@oldcrookedhouse 
@SouthernJetNC Ha! I'm a hard person to convince!
@teletextpage152 Oh weird, here it is: 
I love when our contributors write a thing I go into disagreeing with and come out of agreeing with. If that makes sense.
"Traditional publishing is cracked, and fanfic isn’t the answer. But it’s an answer." 
@Munkhaus @RebeccaSchinsky Uhh, AS a woman of color, I don't find "WOC" (woman of color) offensive, so. Carry yourself.
@catagator I HATE THAT
Am getting to the point where I will just auto-buy anything from @GraywolfPress. Just...just give it to me.
"And the thing is, the people who get the tattoos, I don’t think it’s about the book at all. If we..." 
@ErinKwed that...is very likely

@notsowiseowl Hannah nooooo
And I can't believe I have to say this on a book review but: yo, don't read the comments.
"this book stands on its own, but can only stand with confidence when it has the idea of Toni Morrison as its spine"

Joan Didion bio coming in August! 
It used to be kind of pinky/lavender/white but now it seems mostly FUSCIA and EMERALD and RUBY. I enjoy this.
Is it just me or are the dresses on romance novel covers getting more jewel-toned as time goes by?
@runwithskizzers I am so tempted to read it with, like, one eye closed just in case?
@RebeccaSchinsky 
@RebeccaSchinsky No it's the same one I think? It's coming out in August. I'm rull nervous. Couldn't find a WOC to write it, eh?
Maybe it's awesome. I dunno. I just...white men writing slave narratives about black women? Ehhhhhh *backs away slowly*

"She said there isn’t enough diversity. What the fuck does that mean?" Excellent/horrifying piece about AWP and race: 
@hwheaties Oh nice! Yeah, it's really ideal for us.
Also the Lesbrary is the best name of a blog I have ever seen ever in life the end
So happy to have @danikaellis from the Lesbrary on Book Riot today talking about feminism and the kids' section: 
Ohh nice to see Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the Time 100 list:

@creativtech I appreciate it!
@anneursu 
@eruditeogre Billions of brown and black people exist JUST to throw off your media!
@creativtech -that it will eventually just go away if we all ignore it long enough.
@creativtech I think that means something different than "the diversity trend." The first mean something is changing, the 2nd implies-
We've actually been here this whole time? Like, people of color and LGBTQ people didn't apparate into your world b/c you started noticing us
If you refer to diversity as a trend you might be a garbage person

@sethw "I don't know what Omniture is but I can make some really great Pi Day puns?"
@sethw 
@sethw do you think they'd let me make Janet Jackson jokes or nah
@ReadEngDee ...I do...?
@SongOfMyShelf That's a good line, that is.
HUH the New Yorker is hiring a social media manager: 
@rinceya @mickeysbookexp @readsusieread @OneSmallPaw Yeah same. You can track your reads &amp; still interrogate your column labels.
@mickeysbookexp Yeah the categories could use examination. Though Dominant Narrative/Marginalized group isn't a bad place to start.
@cuttingedgedjs Haha yessss
@cuttingedgedjs Hm? You can link to your blog, that's fine.
@Books_Pieces Ahhhh no! I just think we can examine the wonky parts of the issue w/out abandoning the whole process.
@OneSmallPaw I agree, but folks have to start somewhere, and Dominant Narrative/ Marginalized People is the place to do it.
@Books_Pieces I guess in an ideal world, content creators would pay attention but also just let the diversity bubble up in the content.
@Books_Pieces Oh I see what you mean. That can feel very much like filling out your own report card.
@Books_Pieces B/c I can see how that would seem...braggy? But I also really just like seeing what people read. Iono.
@Books_Pieces What do you mean by forefronting? Making videos about them and all that?
I AM BUYING TICKETS TO A DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL SHOW also I am 30 years old these things are not related
@Books_Pieces (Of course, there's no real way to know whether they do or not, lulz)
@Books_Pieces Then I guess it's a motive thing...I don't see it as something people do just to make themselves feel better.
@OneSmallPaw -at you directly? B/c I don't really have time for that.
@OneSmallPaw Wait, are we having some sort of conversation about the issue, or are you just here to yell at me about how I didn't tweet-
@OneSmallPaw I did read it. I get the reasons. What I was asking was, what's the alternative?
@OneSmallPaw Ok, so are you going to answer my question or just whistle at me or...?
@Books_Pieces I get that, but you said in the video that it's *wrong* and I can't get behind that at all.
@OneSmallPaw Nerp, I didn't
@Books_Pieces -spreadsheet thing. It's got problems. I just don't know what else to do, really.
@Books_Pieces I guess I just don't think it's about what we're getting. Aside from a less racist industry? I mean I don't love the-
@OneSmallPaw @rinceya ...k...?
@wassr1956 @SFReviewsnet 
I'll be at this year's PEN/Faulkner award dinner with @skrishna- buy a ticket and come sit with us: 
@triceratops23 Yeah same- I went back and checked my old Goodreads accounts. 3, 4% POC year after year. NOT GREAT.
-or black or queer people at A LOT OF PARTIES in this business. How else to do that but data collection? Iono.
I don't want to be anyone's token brown girl at the party. I get that. But attention needs to be paid to how there aren't ANY brown-
@StephofLegends EXACTLY. And even if that's not the best reason for the changes, I honestly don't care about the reasons. Want the change.
@rinceya I think it's especially important that media (BR, big booktubers, big bloggers) keep track of this. Amplified voices matter.
@rinceya Especially when doing nothing means you're likely to go back to being part of the problem.
Data, honey. It's what's for dinner. 
It feels like letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Ditching the whole concept b/c the spreadsheet you use isn't comprehensive.
@rinceya I *know* I'd end up back at mine. If we wait for the perfect method of doing a thing, we're never going to do the thing.
@NyashaJunior EXACTLY. And I get that the idea of categories on a spreadsheet is weird, but...what else is there to do? We need the info.
I guess my biggest question is: what's the alternative? I haven't seen one presented.
-openly that the gender binary is problematic, but also: we need to know. So they count. Is that bad? I think it's sort of the opposite.
I especially think that data is useful in aggregate- for example, the VIDA count provides data about sexism that we NEED. They recognize-
No method of "counting" will be perfect, but if you don't do it at all, how will you know where you (or your industry) stands?
So I've been seeing some videos/Tumblrs about people ditching diversity stats b/c of reasons, but I have to wonder: what do you do instead?

@INTROSP3CTIVE Also, words mean things? So the reverse of sexist is (wait for it) not sexist. *jazz hands*
Write it in the margins of your much-loved copy of ON THE ROAD, or maybe FIGHT CLUB. Get it out. Release the rage.
Scream unto the cold nothingness about how your privilege is slipping, slipping from your PBR-slick fingers, and there's nothing you can do.
I mean, explain it to the ether if it's that important to you, bro. Tell the clouds. Tell the immortal, unfeeling void. Let it cradle you.

@RRNvoetbal AAAApparently. They were all up in my mentions for a hot second. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@NyashaJunior *cries silently*
Hi my name's Amanda and I have zero seconds to give to people who think reverse-sexism is real
@gallifreyan @RemipunX Honey, don't come for me unless I call you.
@Templar_Gamer1 Who said I did?
In which a white male critic for WaPo takes issue w/ Morrison's use of "a jarring bit of Ebonics" in her new book: 
@YTM1staWu1fy Why do you keep talking to me as if your opinion is in any way relevant to my life? Bye Felicia.
@Templar_Gamer1 And if that bothers you, you're free to fuck right off
@RemipunX Fuck off.
YES EXCELLENT VERY GOOD 
@bookoisseur @OhioCoastie Girl you got a live one!
@PariahPotimouth they ARE whiny babies, thank you!
@RebeccaSchinsky @_jeremiahn @fuzzytypewriter @ChuckWendig My husband, my coworked, and an author I know walk into a bar...
@KarenaFagan I USED YOUR JAR GIF WOOOOO
@StevilSkittles JAR 
@StevilSkittles wow thanks for your permission it's like totes appreciated 0_o
BYE FELICIA 
@paustinpharmd You're seriously in the wrong place if you think I'm not going to point out problematic stuff when I see it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@paustinpharmd Actually, the hashtag was created by @courtney_s today bc of her book launch. Come correct or go home.
Men explain a hashtag about girls to me
@paustinpharmd If someone's reaction to a thing for girls is WHAT ABOUT THE MENZ then they're part of the problem. I think that's obvious.
@paustinpharmd srsly?
I see some bros have started #ToTheBoys b/c girls aren't allowed to have things, to which I say 
@BookishGeekLife @bookriot On the open call? No, it's a google form so there's no confirmation email or anything
You won't be able to talk about issues specific to girls w/out boys trying to make the convo about themselves. Burn it down. #tothegirls
@catagator 0_o
@catagator is that happening because if anyone what about the boys's me I will riot
Make friends with girls who don't look like you, don't dress like you. Don't exist in an echo chamber. Find a deeper tribe. #tothegirls
Pay attention to how much society tries to sell your demographic certain things, then makes fun of you for liking them. #tothegirls
Never be ashamed of feeling good enough about yourself to take a selfie. They mock you b/c they want you to feel badly. #tothegirls
@erinrileyau Amen and amen.
Making fun of other girls for their choices isn't cute now, and it won't be cute later. "Good for her- not for me." suffices. #tothegirls
Pay attention to how much you apologize throughout the day. Take up space. Don't let boys interrupt you. #tothegirls
@bkshelvesofdoom @RebeccaSchinsky so huge- and LEAKY
@RebeccaSchinsky It's not notable when women cry, because women and hormones or whatever etc

@nnsteele Haha yeah if she likes reading, those are pretty hard to resist :)
@nnsteele Noooo not yet! I've read all the other ones though. OH if she likes mysteries, THE AGENCY series (4 books) by YS Lee
@nnsteele THE GIRL WHO CIRCUMNAVIGATED FAIRYLAND IN A SHIP OF HER OWN MAKINGGGGG
@jilliephillips it's HELLA amazing
Re MEN WE REAPED: I keep thinking about how I grew up poor &amp; brown in the South, but just by virtue of Not Being Black, it's not comparable
@thejeffoneal @RebeccaSchinsky oh Lord *girds loins*
@RebeccaSchinsky @thejeffoneal it's so horrifying to compare my poor Southern childhood to that and see the miles of privilege between them
@sparrowpost yyessssss
@thejeffoneal no, this was my first of hers
@thejeffoneal has totally changed my everything
MEN WE REAPED has wrecked me. Can't think of the last book I read (or even HEARD ABOUT) about being poor, black, and Southern
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
All of these are amazing but the No Child Left Behind one will punch you in the face 
@brennacgray @RebeccaSchinsky Oh well there it is
Amazon suing company that sells 4 and 5 star reviews for $20:

@haldenj hooray!
My mom just called Rand Paul a "ho" lolololol
My mom is having a moment right now
Mom: "Why doesn't my party ever run women for President?" Me: "They'd instantly lose the South, for one." Mom: "...oh my God you're right."
@darlingstewie @triciaennis She then went on to rant about how she wants all women on the Supreme Court. I just nodded.
My very Republican mother: "I'm voting for Hillary, I don't care. She's smarter than our guys and I'm tired of the sausage fest."
weren't salty enough.
Random thought: the phrase "well behaved women rarely make history is crap. As if our lack of presence in history books is just cause we-
Captain Janeway is in this episode of Murder, She Wrote. That is all.
@thejeffoneal this forever yes
@thejeffoneal AHHH what did you think of the Gawande?
@readsusieread Hellz yeah
@readsusieread Woohoo!
Mmmm hmm RT @thejeffoneal: Just gonna leave this here: The VIDA count for women of color at Harper’s: 
groundbreaking and why that interviewer would be vulnerable you can take a mother fucking walk
That profile of Toni Morrison was an honest and rare profile of a woman of color by a woman of color and if you don't get why that's-
@brandonrambles @jeffzentner @djolder Henceforth and forevermore he shall be referred to as "LitBro"
👏 Think 👏 before 👏 you 👏 speak
@brandonrambles @djolder Exactly. UGH RAGE FACE.
@jeffzentner @djolder It's almost like if a dude's bio says "Harpers" I should set my eyes to auto-roll
@djolder He's the best person to defend ToMo from the likes of her black fans, dontchaknow.
@djolder -on his smug fucking Shhh the White Man Is Speaking Now bullshit
@djolder I *hate* that his mentions are full of black and brown people explaining why that piece is important, and he just doubles down-
Critics who don't understand basic concepts of racism in this day and age are shitty critics.
@djolder But DJ he's COLOR BLIND. He gets a COOKIE for that, didn't you know?
@thejeffoneal 
@catagator my standard answer to "what about the men" is "oh is the entire western canon not good enough or"
YouTubers, tell me what cameras you use and if you love or hate them.
@fuzzytypewriter @booksabound @HeyPanels oh yeah I love it, super creepy
@booksabound @HeyPanels did anyone suggest Wytches yet?
"I simply thought that Filipinos were not allowed to be in books." ANND preach. 
@bookwormkara @RebeccaSchinsky @thejeffoneal I haven't, but only b/c I'm generally all nonfic on audio
@KarenaFagan Yeah it reminded me at first of WHEN WOMEN WERE BIRDS
@KarenaFagan It's SO great
@catagator KELLY GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
Oh man I just INHALED Jenny Offill's DEPT. OF SPECULATION in a sitting. Women and poetic rage seems to be a weakness of mine?
@BWRBooks AHHHHHH yay! Tell me how you like it!
@lamzy_divey @RebeccaSchinsky it's mostly "don't be a douche canoe"

It's two people. Connecting. With four other people. And aliens.
@SciHousewife -the comments. But it's not like that every day. (It is today)
@SciHousewife Mmm depends. If we're publishing something I know is going to be controversial, I can spend up to half my day moderating-
@RebeccaSchinsky @dellaustin stop sexting us adam gawd
@readingtheend @alice_sings I guess, though I like it with grated sharp cheddar so it's less a spread and more like a dip?
@readingtheend @alice_sings It seems to be a very bougie sort of Southern thing. Maybe Mid-Atlantic thing?
@alice_sings quiet yankee
@_ellison I hope I never come to that because I eat it by the buckets now
@jbakernyc @sesinkhorn haha right here:  
@SwampOfBoredom why have I never THOUGHT of that
@DCWorldDeadman apparently!
@tysephine it is soooo good
@SwampOfBoredom OH MY GOD MY HEAD JUST EXPLODED
@sesinkhorn @brennacgray haha yeppp
there are a lot of things wrong with the South but pimento cheese is not one of them
@sethw *brushes shoulders off*
@KarenaFagan dogs are dumb I LOVE DOGS
@LadyT_TNT It's the post about the Hugo awards from yesterday
@DavidJonFuller @brennacgray \_(ツ)_/¯
The number of dudes who leave realllyyy sketchy comments using their work emails is...surprising
@brennacgray it's the best thing that has ever happened
The internet will never be able to take this gift away from me.
@nevesytrof FUCK YOU BELIGIUM IS LAME #censors
@haldenj Oh man I hope not
Bahaha you guys this guy is maaaddddd 
@McFlyCahill90 It's very POINTY

@LadyT_TNT @RebeccaSchinsky well after us it's @thejeffoneal and he's not going to get what he wants from Jeff either /shrug
@RebeccaSchinsky Hey if they want door #2, I'll gladly pop some popcorn and watch THAT shitshow
@hwheaties They'd be easy to make- it was just tots w/ nacho toppings. AMAZING AND DELICIOUS.
Ohhh first unboxing of Book Riot's YA box! 
@LanetteKauten @patricianels Well neither, really, since they don't exist. Sort of a combo of both?
@McFlyCahill90 -you don't HAVE to be. Your bullshit DREW THEM IN. That should tell you something.
@McFlyCahill90 Oh that's exactly what I'm talking about. I keep getting these comments like "but SP isn't ASSOCIATED w/ them" and I"m like-
@yanquis1972 just some crazy Hugo award stuff
Like, if you're pushing an agenda that IN ANY WAY draws in that crowd, your agenda is wrong and harmful. AUTOMATICALLY.
So, if your movement draws in g*merg*ters, even if your intention wasn't to be awful, your movement is inherently bullshit. Just so you know

@MicheleinPhilly YESSSS. Walking around smacking myself.
@jeffzentner that'll preach
Ah, that day-after tattoo sting. How I've (not even a little) missed you (I hate you)
Wonder if the Daughters of the Confederacy are hanging out outside their building with Confederate flags TODAY
@haldenj That was my experience, as well. I should've known better- why would women write women w/ no agency?
"But comics isn’t a zero-sum game. As a brown woman, my gain isn’t a white man’s loss." 
@rivercityreadin Yeahhhh same. About the ONLY kind I can get behind, lulz.

@everyist YES. It's very like...aww. Buddy.
People who use "social justice warrior" as an insult are not good at knowing what words mean
@BWRBooks it means "social justice warrior" and it's a thing white men say to insult, well, anyone
Hi my name's Amanda and I auto-ban people who use the term "SJW" as an insult *twirls*
Book Riot is officially #noncompliant. Or, ya know, me and @RebeccaSchinsky are. @kellysue

@MissLiberty @peterdamien well I have one you can borrow but it has a wine glass on it
VIDA's women of color count, though. Y U so white, NYTBR? 
@MissLiberty @peterdamien how are you going to hide your shame, Lib? HOW
@MissLiberty I mean it's not like you read a lot or whatever
Just me, this bottle of vinho verde, and snuggle time with the VIDA count
Love this from @VIDA_lit about things you can do now to advance women's writing: 
@_jeremiahn @MannyOWar @sethw honey

@AccioBooks Yeah that's lame
@SwampOfBoredom Haha thank you!
Some opinions are hateful. Some "sides" are bullshit shields for bigotry. People w/ those opinions don't have a RIGHT to your space.
I love social media, but it has given us all this incorrect notion that every fucking thing we say is valid and important and worthy
Community Moderating w/ Amanda: not every opinion is valid, not every side deserves airing, and your space does not need to be open to all.
@miss_amandamae I have reached my zenith, it's only down from here
"Death isn't the only thing I eat" you guys I can't do better than that
@writerrhiannon Oh there's already jokes about Elder Wands and jokes about "9 inches of wood with a dragon core"
@DaveCarr someone just typed "Want to check out my cupboard under the stairs?" and everything is the best
What's happening right now is that the contributors are creating a shared Google doc of Harry Potter pick-up lines.
@hwheaties I don't! I might later.
I love that so many of the smart women I respect are doing Tiny Letters. Every day is like a new gem of awesome in my inbox!
@_ellison Um do it
Tomorrow, @RebeccaSchinsky and I are getting matching tattoos. LOOK OUT WORLD.

@amandareid Yessss everything about it is so boss
@alice_sings ugh fine
@BWRBooks WHAT NO GET IT GET IT NOW
@alice_sings COME TO BEAAAAAAAAAAA dammit
The first LUMBERJANES trade comes out today and you should buy it and I say so on YouTube: 
@tysephine Yeah up here it's "New Or-leans" or, if you go way out in the country "New OrLEANS"
My Bad Feminist thing of the day is that I giggle when men around here use "darlin'" as a substitute for "miss" or "you there"
Loving the audio of MEN WE REAPED, but every time she says "New Ahlins" I get so confused about where she's talking about

Sorry if you need me today I'll be buried in pie charts

@TabithaBlanken @clintonk @thejeffoneal niiceeee *Saved By the Bell high five*
@applevenus NO ME LIKEY
@TabithaBlanken @clintonk @thejeffoneal oh hell to the nah
@outdoorgirl_27 Not an idiot! It's why We Need Diverse Books is sponsoring POC interns in publishing. Gets at the root of the problem.
@MinoritiesinPub Exactly. I think I'm so bothered b/c the job is so much like mine, which I would NEVAH do for free
@DearSplenda @missellabell this also Bothers Me Very Much
@clintonk @thejeffoneal they say "volunteer" as if you're working for a charity instead of a pop culture rag (which I like, but still)
@Meryl_Kate AHAHAHA accurate
somebody hold my earrings
@Daayla ugh vom dot com
THIS is why publishing is so whiteeeeeee *explodes*
@LaurieGrassi @thejeffoneal and EXPOSURE and WARM FUZZY FEELINGS
Also if you demand people work for you for free what you're going to get is a bunch of rich white kids. YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.
@thejeffoneal Damn skippy
@HelenMcClory Yeah, I get "working for exposure" too b/c I've done that- but this isn't that. This is a full time job.
UGH PAY YOUR PEOPLE 
"The editor works with contributors through all stages of the editorial process" this is a full time job, yo.
@HelenMcClory I am full of rage a bit right now
@vantine YES YES YOU ARE
@KittinExploits Right? POOR CHOICE OF WORDS and also actions
All I'm saying is if @thejeffoneal sent me my job description and said "this is a volunteer position" I would've said something RULL rude
"This is a volunteer position." Are pop culture blogs non-profits or charities now or is this a memo I missed
This Bothers Me Very Much.
So this job opening for The Rumpus is very similar to my job, but they want you to do it for free: 
Wow made the mistake of reading Goodreads reviews of ON IMMUNITY hold on while I go try to recover my faith in humanity's reasoning skills

@SouthernJetNC Right? I mean if anyone has it rough, it's suburbanites. ;)
@baileymichelle Ehmehgerd every time I go to NYC I have a mini-stroke. It STRESSES me out.
Also, my neighbors are all elderly white people who are suspicious of me and therefore don't talk to me. IT'S WIN WIN.
I'll drive 20 minutes into the city for good food though if it means I get to find easy parking everywhere else I go
.@OliviaKelly_ Ugh, they do. And our restaurants are bullshit.
@tiffanyreisz Either that or it's square to be square and I just don't care *waves hands in the air as is appropriate*
I know it's not hip to like suburbia but damn are our libraries fine and our grocery store aisles wide
@BWRBooks I am just as guilty of it as the contributors. We all need t-shirts that say this.
Thing I send pieces back for more than anything else: "I thinks/I feels/Probablys." YOU ARE SMART. YOU HAVE EVIDENCE. DECLARE THAT SHIT.

@alan_uplc And that abuse SHOULD be reported to the authorities.
@alan_uplc We're talking about "don't feed the trolls" rhetoric and the abuse women face online. We're not talking about the same thing.
@alan_uplc @the_author_ Sure, but until then, women need to do what women need to do.
@alan_uplc @the_author_ We're not talking about the same thing.
@alan_uplc @the_author_ -I wanted in the first place. And I am 100% fine with it.)

@alan_uplc @the_author_ A stranger calling me names in a restaurant is threatening. I'd call the cops. Don't care what you think about it.
@the_author_ -me a bitch, I'm going to call the cops. My presence in public isn't permission for you to be a fuckwad.
@the_author_ I hate that "don't want abuse, don't talk" bullshit. A restaurant is public, too, but if you come up to my table and call-

@FictionalFoley Sure! One Good Earl Deserves a Lover by Sarah Maclean, The Lord of Scoundrels by Loretta Chase are my faves right now!
We're all just a little bit more basic than we like to admit
So I'm not saying we should imagine these guys trolling the Hugos in pink hats being chased by Peeves. I'm just...ya know. Saying.
People who smugly deny there are racism and sexism issues in books/reading and insist on continuing as is are the Dolores Umbridges of books
Waiittt what happened at the Hugos?
It's a @GraywolfPress kinda Saturday 
@shannoodling Sure! One Good Earl Deserves a Lover by Sarah Maclean, Lord of Scoundrels by Loretta Chase
Ahhhhh men asking me for romance recs is my happy place
@haldenj Nice! Let me know how it goes :)
@haldenj One Good Earl Deserves a Lover (MC is a scientist!) by Sarah Maclean or Lord of Scoundrels (MC is hella logical) by Loretta Chase
@balletbookworm @booksabound @BookRiot Dain4Lyfe
@booksabound 
@duke_duke_goose Great point. We don't "deserve" happy endings.
@booksabound @BookRiot Let me know what you think! I especially rec Sarah Maclean and THE LORD OF SCOUNDRELS by Loretta Chase for newbs :)
@mwlinder99 Oh gotcha :)
@booksabound Oh you know it- here: 
@mwlinder99 I don't think either statement is true. I think we've just taught men that women and their stories are less important.
@mwlinder99 YES THAT IS WEIRD TO US AS WELL YES
Anyway this has been early morning thoughts about why romance is more feminist than you with Amanda, thank you for coming
-is sort of bound to come up with heroines who reflect strength and critical thought.
I mean, any woman who is brave enough to write about sex (in our prudish society) in a genre by and for mostly women (in our patriarchy)-
@mwlinder99 Oh for sure
@jenna_goodall YES! Sarah is the business. Dahl is next on my TBR!
@_elizabethriley Eloisa James are my faves right now
@_elizabethriley Hellz yeah- literally anything by Sarah Maclean, LORD OF SCOUNDRELS by Loretta Chase, WHEN BEAUTY TAMED THE BEAST by-
Literary fiction should look at romance and be embarrassed by itself tbh
@amgamble Right? An entire genre dedicated to exploring what makes women happy.
I've read more self-aware, complicated, self-sufficient, social-justice oriented heroines in regency romance than I have in lit fic BY FAR
The more romance I read, the more I realize that people who claim the genre is anti-feminist simply haven't read any.

"In one study on gender parity in the workforce, sent my way by colleague Flavia Dzodan, it was found..." 
Study that shows that men  consistently think their industry/employer is more equal gender-wise than it really is:

@thebooksluts @jchristie I just wanna wander around and count (buy things)
@jchristie It'd be interesting to compare displays at indies (generally not paid for?) to displays at B&amp;N (paid for)
@jchristie Right? Major *side-eye* to those guys.
@freckledreader I wish I could find that actual study she's citing
@PraxJarvin @amydieg All I can find is a link to GD talking about the study, but not the thing itself.
@amydieg Ohhh thanks! I feel like I'm losing it in a I KNOW I READ THIS WHERE THE FUCK IS IT sort of way
@amydieg I know! I'm trying to find the study I read about it last year but not finding it...
@LizB Thank you!
@the_author_ wut holy shit
-reads to many people as a TAKING OVER b/c our general representation is so awful in media.
A cursory glance at displays in most bookstores reveals that that is obviously false. But the presence of A HANDFUL of books by women-
So those last RTs are IRT men claiming that the books of female authors are taking over bookstores, so sexism is dead in publishing.
@ruthbrarian Thank you!
What's that study about how when women are only 30% of a crowd, men report thinking they've taken over the crowd?
@sethw In books it's like, all the customers are women. And the bloggers. But the publishers, traditional reviews, anyone w/ power? Dude.
@sethw Exactly!

April Fool's jokes I considered: Book Riot will no longer be covering books by white men. GRRM finally finished with WINDS OF WINTER!
I solemnly swear I have published no April Fool's stories
@PrincetonPL Haha no, not research, just responding to comments telling me that sexism isn't real b/c some women published books one time.
@O_Waite ugghhhhhhhh *rolls around making sounds*
If you're gonna give me that "this snow over here disproves climate change!" bullshit at least pick someone like Anne Rice I mean DAMN
Or JK Rowling (who used initials for the same reason) or EL James (same) or or or
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. If you want to prove to me that sexism isn't real, STOP SAYING STUPID SHIT.
Pro tip: don't use the success of the Brontes (who published under male pseudonyms b/c: sexism) to disprove sexism in publishing

#awkward RT @catagator: Calling a brown woman a zealot at that.
Like, I get it. You read a book once and you've been to a bookstore. Please tell me more about your theories on gender issues in publishing.
As much as being constantly challenged by men is annoying, what's more annoying is when they DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
When a man calls you a zealot while in the same breath providing data that backs up the thing you said. Get it together, bros. Come correct.

This comment was deleted (obvs) but I'm in the mood to let people know what women in books deal with:

I'm not going to sacrifice my mental health &amp; possibly physical safety in order to maintain a nice atmosphere on a site that doesn't pay me.
The onus is on GOODREADS (or whatever site) to create a harassment-free space- it's not on women to TOLERATE IT in the name of "the fight."
It's not "letting the trolls win" if we remove our reasonable voices from a space we don't like. I don't have any responsibility to GR.

@balletbookworm I wonder what their marketing budget is like. Do they even need one?
Whole tables in stores anticipating a book that's months away. It's gonna be (the) big(gest). 
@estellasrevenge PREACH IT I love her so hard
@mollytempleton amen to that
Narnia's White Witch for trying to get hers #womeninfiction
Nora from THE WOMAN UPSTAIRS for being angry. #womeninfiction
@TheNormanNation SAMESIES
Amy from GONE GIRL for being an unapologetic mother fucker #womeninfiction
You might've written ten novels but since you've called women in YA assholes we probably won't be reading the 11th.
@ScrewyDecimal I think that IS helpful
Nothing Compares 2 U playing in empty grocery store. Am I in an indie film?

@hkpmcgregor @BookRiot I haven't, but I probably should. Cause I have THOUGHTTSS about that.
@paul_haine @jadoogan stahp
@jadoogan Well. There are a lot of swamps? I could canoe them moodily.
@KatWithSword @bloodmilk Thank you I'm obsessseedd with it
@BWRBooks @BloodMilk Thank you!
@jadoogan THAT IS MY SECRET PLAN
New community guidelines at @BookRiot- see if you can spot the difference: 
My new sparrow claw/moonstone wedding ring from @bloodmilk is here and I lurve it. 
@kayeholl @callielafleur *head desk*
And so often men who say women just don't like writing will also complain that YA is overflowing with over-represented women. PICK ONE.
If you don't believe me, day in and day out. It's exhausting, and we only write about it a few times a week
I don't know how women who only write about feminism do it. Explaining over and over that yes my experience is real and no it doesn't matter
Honestly bros, say that out loud and think about how ridiculous you sound, and how unworthy of considerate response.
A moratorium on men telling me gender inequity isn't b/c of sexism (which I'm making up) but because women just don't like writing.
Men explain the editorial process and editorial bias to me
@frannypadilla OHHH yes, gotcha :)
@frannypadilla Virginia Woolf loved Middlemarch
@CoffeeGirl217 @SciHousewife I totally get why it isn't for some people. It is very...very...VERY...long.
@SciHousewife Ehmehgerd yes. In my top 5 favorites of all time
@clnichols6 I have a large spot in my heart for Rosamond, as awful as she is.
@clnichols6 I don't remember but I never liked Will so everything associated with him is bleak in my brain
I mean I don't care if you don't LIKE it, but don't come up here with "characterization" and "structure" and look it's perfect so stop
@artistajax wrong people
I judge people who think MIDDLEMARCH is flawed.
When lost for what stock image to use for a post, the answer is always "dog in glasses pretending to read a book"
My Poe rock really likes Lauren F. Winner. 
*abandons binge-watch of Kimmy Schmidt, begins binge-watch of Empire*
@Kenmeister9000 I JUST REALIZED I CAN WATCH IT ON THE COMPUTER I know what I'm doing this weekend
I'm here for anything that's bigger than the Super Bowl tbh
Empire is bigger than the Super Bowl with African-Americans under 50. This is neat.
WHOA! 71% of African-American women b/t 18 and 49 who watch TV when Empire airs are watching Empire: 
@bigbookspodcast @AlyssitActivity ahahaha you said Rosamund is Randian that is so good
@jennbookshelves Hmm good to know
@AlyssitActivity @bigbookspodcast I know what I'm doing on my lunchhhh breakkk
@jennbookshelves YES that's where I got them! I emptied out the dollar spot
@SilverNeurotic ...I don't think I know the answer to that
Bought a dozen hot pink magazine holders from Target for my comics b/c short boxes are ugly AMA
@AlyssitActivity AHAHA so accurate
Ok if we're being honest the theme is "eating food" and "destroying my belongings"
My twins' 4th birthday party is this weekend the theme is "congratulations on surviving" and I didn't look at Pinterest once what do I win

WE HAVE A BIG BOOKS MUG 
@booksmugglers Iono man. I did what I could for Thor and Storm, but I'm sad.
Thor, Captain Marvel, Storm all ending in May: 
@mat_johnson Yeah, and I don't have a lot of trust in a critic with such a lack of self-awareness.
@skrishna @SciHousewife I read almooossttt all of The Corrections and it was exactly what you'd expect it to be.
@fuzzytypewriter @thejeffoneal doesn't matter there are birds in both places
I mean, it's either laziness or privilege blindness, and either way, I just can't get excited about him.
You can't be held up as the best critical American voice if you 100% dismiss something so important to everyone who doesn't look like you.
-means he's either ignorant of its value or he's purposefully ignoring it. Either way, I'm not interested in his opinion about much.
Here's my main beef w/ J Franz: social media is where marginalized voices come to do their thing. He dismisses social media entirely. Which-
@thejeffoneal did he go birdwatching there one time or
@_ellison RIGHT? I hope her novels are about makeup cause I'd read em
train wreck RT @thejeffoneal: Gender and the internet. Just what I go to Franzen for.
@brennacgray "I'm not here for the coffee bitches I'm here because you aren't my kids"
@westmetromommy we've never written about him before (thank gawdddd)
@thejeffoneal Soooo much that
Huh, Zoella's getting a second novel after all that ghostwriting kerfuffle-age from last year: 
@McFlyCahill90 This is your nightly news today a Starbucks delivery person was kicked out of 20 homes in 20 hours!
Are they going to make the delivery drivers discuss race relations with people at their houses or nah
Starbucks is testing a delivery service in Seattle: 
@scorpstar77 I doubt she will. They rarely do because they have no reason other than "I don't like that person's face."
This video of Meryl Streep doing accents is oddly soothing 
@Upstreamism We wrote about Kanye a few weeks ago and they didn't just doubt that he reads (he says he doesn't) but that he even CAN
@book_madam Girl she already got those 
I mean is sampling a famous novelist not proof enough for you that she's educated or do you need a pic of her in a cardigan
Like if I give you a pic of Beyonce and Aziz Ansari and you say I doubt BEYONCE reads I'mma side eye you so hard
@hwheaties Girl we don't talk about Justin Bieber it's an editorial standard ;) (jokes, jokes)
When we talk about public figures reading, 100% of the "I doubt that person even reads" comments are about black people. 100%.
@jnelsonmk Thank you!
This storify sums up why I don't feel obligated to respond to demands for "debate" on social media: 
Over on @HeyPanels, interesting thoughts on the new Wonder Woman costume: 
@justabookworm I have been singing that to everything. Pinot Noir. Put your shoes on. Pinot Noir. Where's my coffee?
Teach for America or something.
I haven't examined this very carefully. I just know I'd totally read a comic about Wayne giving up punch/kick crime-fighting to join-
In Which I Have Conflicted Feelings About Letting My Kids Watch Batman B/C I Wish Wayne's Arc Was 100% About Combatting Crime Thru Education
Whoa, Kobo's parent company has bought Overdrive: 
@JillianneWrites Umm maybe 3? If at that point you're not digging it, it won't get better
The best part of the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is that Titus sings in every episode
@T3rryBowman @thejeffoneal dude I moderate the fuck out of our comments
@SongOfMyShelf that is the nerdiest thing anyone has ever said to me I LOVE IT
@fuzzytypewriter @thejeffoneal @jchristie OUR comments, hellz yeah, but like everywhere else nah don't care
@thejeffoneal @jchristie no no 
@SongOfMyShelf People keep saying "clunky" which makes me noottt want to read it
@skrishna @thejeffoneal That's basically what The Toast does, though I've never seen it stated anywhere
@robotnic @thejeffoneal I don't really consider that a dissenting voice so much as pointless bitching/trolling. They don't want conversation
@thejeffoneal @robotnic Right. I'm just less sympathetic (and easy-going) towards comments like this that are from people who wander in.
@robotnic @thejeffoneal He wasn't- I remember that commenter. Wandered in from somewhere, probs Facebook.
@thejeffoneal I like how he says "feminist," like...the singular one.
@fuzzytypewriter IS IT PRETTY this actually does matter to me
Have any of you read the Tolkien translation of Beowulf? Just wondering how folks like it.
@srhlib Ugh, disappointing. I was looking forward to it.
@Cuddlebuggery check your blog inbox por favor :)
@3umenides WHAAA YOU ARE THE BEST
@geekstarter Nice, thanks
@geekstarter I haven't seen that feature! Where is it, in the block area?
@geekstarter Yeah, not so much? Apparently it's a Gamerg*** technique, and we all know how effective THOSE are. 0_o
@jadoogan So block them, if you've got the time. Think the goal is to swell your follower count w/ spam, then report you.
@geekstarter Wait until our follower counts are a large part spam bots, them report us, I guess?
@jadoogan The same kind of bots are following/followers of the Fake RJS account, so we're about 1000% sure. Or I am, anyway.
I want to point out that the day we published a very feminist post, some1 paid to send thousands of spambots after the BR contributor list.
@chessshaw @fuggirls are girls after my own heart
YES EXCELLENT GOOD. 
@balletbookworm @skrishna ugh it's so annoying
@skrishna TELL ME b/c I'm like "what is the point of this"
@skrishna You know what the deal is lady
@3umenides wow thanks! Either, really
@_ellison -yucky do what makes your feels happy ! Cannot.
@_ellison I think they could write cool stuff about tech-oriented efficiency etc, but the books I've read are all ew being a grown up is-
@itsavolcano RIGHT? Like. Ok. But I live in the suburbs of Richmond and am not moving. Soooo?
@3umenides Mmm mostly creativity/efficiency stuff? GETTING THINGS DONE, LEAN IN
@thejeffoneal NOOOO but I'll audiobook it rn
@balletbookworm he is a god among men
"Don't be lazy." "Do what you love." No shit, Sherlock.
I'm finding it really hard to find business books by people of my generation that aren't totally infuriating or vapid. Come on, folks.
Let the record show that "Is 2014 a new era in feminism where we don't have to talk about it? I hope so." is where I put down GIRLBOSS
@_ellison it's so fucking ridiculous
@BWRBooks GILMORE GIRLS REUNION?
Let's stop saying Capote wrote TKAM and instead consider that maybe Lee wrote IN COLD BLOOD
I feel this. The Pressure of Supporting Comics: 
@SciHousewife @RebeccaSchinsky Thanks so much!
@GeekElite 
@StephofLegends I never even thought of that. That's a great point.
@thejeffoneal Funny how those guys never seem to remember that I exist
@rivercityreadin haha thanks *salutes*
@rivercityreadin haha that's a link too- at google?
@rivercityreadin Can I send you an email?
@rivercityreadin SHANNON! Are you going to BEA/Blogger Con?
@catagator @RebeccaSchinsky girl I am strapping that shit to my thigh under my dress
@catagator 
Who's going to Blogger Con, show of hands!
@bobbymathews @rebeccaschinsky Thanks so much, sir!
@hkpmcgregor @triceratops23 See also: clothing design (sewing: women's work, high fashion: dudes)
@The_Old_Hack Hahaha pretty much
@mielsnickety @BookRiot Aww thank you!
@triceratops23 Yeah it's a ridiculous statement not deserving of real consideration (which is why I responded w/ "dude that shit cray")
Ugh I'm gonna be that guy who posts a nice thing someone else wrote about them: 7 Ways Book Riot Wins at Social Media 
That Is The Problem In A Nutshell dot tumblr dot com
When a dude says "women aren't as interested in writing as men" and I say "thattt is rull dumb" and dudes give ME grief for being combative
Anyway if you force some poor barista to talk to you about race relations you're probably a garbage person
@SongOfMyShelf SUCH a bad idea
@Debbie_Kinsey ohmygod
@alice_sings I'd for real jut take a train up but my boys' birthday shindig is this weekend and they're old enough to know if I cancel lulz
@Debbie_Kinsey for real? *head desk*
@KarenaFagan ugh
Putting the burden of race relations on people in the service industry is a super-great idea nothing can go wrong 0_0
Starbucks no. Starbucks why. Starbucks stahp.
Whoa what 
@QueenVogelfrei -and the writers they've announced so far have all been white. But it's early days, so we'll see.
@QueenVogelfrei Well, they're explicitly and exclusively covering literary fiction- no genre at all- and that's traditionally white, male. -
I'm going to the @penfaulkner awards dinner with @skrishna because we're fancy literary ladies
I'm over on @BookRiot's YouTube channel talking about upcoming books to put on your hold list ASAP: 
@alice_sings @MegsGranger Well PISH
@SciHousewife @RebeccaSchinsky hahahaha
@alice_sings HEY are you going to BEA?
But I super-hope I'm wrong about that. I hope they come out with some amazing and diverse voices. I just, ya know. Have concerns.
I'm interested in what Lithub will do, but from what I've heard it just sounds like a hearkening back to good ole white boy book coverage.
@readsusieread @RebeccaSchinsky Thank you!
@paustinpharmd I don't know b/c the account + the post indicates a level of obsessiveness w/ her that's just unsettling
@jnelsonmk @_jeremiahn  they're overseas so probably not a lot to be done
I'm just a [ban] hammer looking for a [very specific] nail
@mittenstrings Instagram is great. Flowers and selfies and cupcakes and picnics. I love it with zero irony.
@Brisvoboda I want her to be God for real
@triceratops23 *whispers* it's the worst
Octavia Spencer is going to play God in an adaptation of THE SHACK, which is apparently happening: 
@maryfernandez31 @skrishna Exactly. How long did it take them to recreate the Book Riot font? Must've been hours and hours.
@skrishna THAT is what gets me. The level of obsessiveness. How empty must your life be that you have space for that sort of thing?
@MikeBrendan it's beyond. I just don't understand.
Someone took the time to alter pics of her. Copy the Book Riot font. Write a bizarre screed. IT is LITERALLY scary, this shit.
The idea of someone taking that much time out of their day to obsess about a woman they don't like is FRIGHTENING, you guys.
Let's talk about how creepy that is. Let's talk about how bizarre and sad and pathetic that is.
Someone took the time to set up a blog to mock @RebeccaSchinsky but the web is totes safe for women: 
Every year, we give 2% of our revenue to a charity you nominate. This year, it's @FirstBook! 
Great post from @HeyPanels about Poison Ivy's costumes: 
!! RT @BookRiot: Scientists believe they've found the remains of Miguel de Cervantes: 
@cgarbarino I love watching people do well, but I guess some people really need to get hobbies or something.
There's something deeply weird &amp; creepy in knowing that there are actual people watching everything you do, waiting for you to mess up.
@JVinRVA welllll we got the claws cut but not the caps on. So half a win?
My kingdom for the ability to edit tweets. Ms Marvel is their #1 *digital* title, not overall. MUST CORRECT. Instead, just delete.
@mwlinder99 That's a fair assumption to make, especially in the context of a conversation about young women being too vocal about costumes
@cameronMstewart @mrbowers @skrishna I'm sorry he didn't stay and try listen to what readers have to say.
@mwlinder99 She is #1 DIGITAL for Marvel though- that's probs why those figures got stuck in my head
@mwlinder99 Thank you!
@mwlinder99 Oh wait that was 2014- j/k
@mwlinder99 Oh? Last I heard she was Marvel's #1, now I'm seeing she's at #24 overall- do you have a better source? 
@fuzzytypewriter @skrishna @ArdoOmer  
@ArdoOmer @skrishna And the examples he uses! Ms. Marvel? Batgirl? Those books are BANGING OUT sales, bro. Get it right or go home.
Ok but if you rant about how Ms Marvel's costume is "unflattering" and "ugly" and don't know it's a salwar kameez *whispers* that's racist
@skrishna Also, if you're gonna call women who feel this was the "vocal minority" while sales of Ms Marvel/Batgirl literally eclipse yours..
@skrishna Which: dude...
@skrishna Does he seriously not know that Ms. Marvel's costume is based on a salwar kameez? Cause he calls it "unflattering" and  "awkward"
@jadoogan Mine will be so pissed, but I just had to replace my couch cover so I don't carrreeee anymore
@thebooksluts PURRITO yes
About to try to put claw caps on my cat so preemptive prayers for what is about to be my mauled flesh are appreciated
@tarynor Yes! I especially appreciate @cameronMstewart right now (whose Batgirl I seriously love)
Comics creators who rant about a (female) "vocal minority" ruining everything with their complaints about objectification r creators I skip.
@jeffzentner Last I heard, yeah
Look I'm not going to get out of hand I just want to touch the hem of her garment ok
NDB, Toni Morrison is coming to DC (!!!!!) 
Some days you don't even have to say haters to the left because all the news is so good it pushes them that way for you
@RebeccaSchinsky @jodiwilldare Amen to that
@MorganTheScribe It was the first time I'd ever been accused of reverse-racism, and you know your first time is always memorable ;)
@MorganTheScribe Sure- and the comments are still visible on the post: 
@MorganTheScribe It was the most ridiculous response I think I've ever gotten, that fiction isn't the right place for learning.
@MorganTheScribe and I told him to look up the definition of fiction, and of course he was moderated for the name-calling.
@MorganTheScribe -I was "racist" and "trash" and that I shouldn't be looking to fiction to learn about other people's lived experiences-
@MorganTheScribe I read a bunch of Amish fiction once for a post and critiqued it for featuring no people of color, and a commenter told me-
@MissLiberty OH my holy housecat Libs if you write a book I will be very happy NO PRESSURE but srsly do it but also no pressure (do it)
Why yes, university where I got my history degree, I would like to attend an alumni lecture on women in early Christian church #nerdtweet
Community moderation, as much as the content you put out, is where we mold the conversation of the book world. Make it better.
@thejeffoneal they want to do the writing/talking, but not the reading/listening, I guess. Typical. ;)
And look, women buy more books than men. If your community isn't safe for your best customers, what's the point. 
If your community isn't a safe space for women, people of color, or other marginalized voices, you're not. Doing. Your job.
.@MorganTheScribe's tweets right now are exactly why we're so strict about our comment policy.
WUT @VIDA_lit has an awards show?! Nice. 
This from @catagator about sexism, feminism, YA, and the publishing industry is so good: 
Hushbuck app lets you swipe left to unfollow someone on Facebook: 
@fuzzytypewriter 0_o
@fuzzytypewriter But it sort of looks like body paint? With bracelet thingies and a crotch flap. Which is fine?
@triciaennis her skin holds secret powers I never knew about I guess
@sambonie done and donnneeee
What's the dust-up about Wonder Woman's new costume? It's still sexy- it's a second skin. I don't get it.
Great post from @HeyPanels: Comics Aren't For Girls- 
@readingtheend Haha no he hasn't- he said good morning to me by name and I was like "and to you, kind sir!" But I'll buck up and do it.
@LadyT_TNT YES I CAN why didn't I think of that I will do this
Look just when a new person moves in don't introduce yourself on moving day b/c they are so stressed and won't remember *sobs*
@readingtheend ahhhhhh but what if he hates me 0_0
I see that many of you support the mailbox break in idea so if I get caught I'm pleading Twitter made me do it
But I would get caught and go to jail for being a creeper because my life is a sitcom
Have legit thought about leaving a thing in their mailbox (holiday card? Cookies) so I could peek at their letters and read their name.
Lived here almost two years and can't remember Nice Neighbor Man's name and it's too late to ask and uggghhhh #socializingfail
@alice_sings "if I kept my hair natural like yours, I'd be bald" ahhhh this is the best
@alice_sings OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS
Happy to have my bosom friend @alice_sings on BR today rec'ing books for Women's History Month: 
@GeekeryDo ahhhhaaa what does that song even mean
MONNDDAYYYYY *rides in on an eagle with fire for a tail, hopes it doesn't rain b/c that would ruin the whole image*
@thisisastub @CTDPress @bookriot @skrishna Interesting! Thanks for the heads up!
If you tell me that men are just more interested in being writers than women I'm gonna make jokes about Home Depot just gird your loins
Sometimes the internet gives you a gift so perfect you can only bask in its glow
!!!! RT @alice_sings: I'm an IDIOT for never applying Material Girl to Scarlett O'Hara. 
why is Josh Lyman on Brooklyn 99
@tiffanyreisz oh totes
@chance3398 noooo stahp
guys repeat after me I will not compare people who disagree with me and who are not genocidal maniacs to Hitler kthanks
@cthulhuchick YES EXACTLY
@RXT1885 Spoilers!
A 13th century English woman commits herself to God by being shut up in a 9x7 cell forEVER and there are SHENANIGANS
Historical fiction folks, @robyncad's THE ANCHORESS is a thing you need to read. (FSG, May 12, no joke, buy that noise.)
@tiffanyreisz And even if it's not you, you're gonna have to sit through like 30 minutes of someone explaining who did it to you
@tiffanyreisz THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING
@SongOfMyShelf YES both. I'm reading a bio of the inklings and they were both That Cranky Old White Professor- adorable/awful.
Man do I ever love Lewis and Tolkien...with a nice barrier of 85 years. They sound INSUFFERABLE, even if JRR does look like Santa
@cthulhuchick So rude (but also hilarious)(but mostly rude)
TIL that CS Lewis wrote parodies of TS Eliot's poems...and then submitted them to journals where Eliot was editor
@mwlinder99 Thanks, Matt. *salutes* :)
@mwlinder99 I'm sure it's coming from a good place, but right now's not a great time to give me advice about how to be a feminist.
@mwlinder99 Why do you think I'm here to catch flies? I'm here to tell women to speak. I don't care who likes it.
If you require women or POC to perform a certain way before you'll let them speak, you're just playing at being a Good Liberal Book Person.
@mwlinder99 God this is such bullshit. My inbox would disagree with you.
@mwlinder99 And it is absolutely only ever white men who say this to me. Ever.
@mwlinder99 I am 100% unconcerned with how white dudes feel about my presentation of feminism. It's not about your feelings tbh.
@tiffanyreisz You're right. And I'm so guilty of rage-tweeting when something sets me off. Should eat pie instead, probs.
@tiffanyreisz I need that tattooed on my ass so people can read it as I walk away from their ridiculousness
But I am sorry when people in my industry call themselves allies to POC and to women, but only when we behave. Makes me livid.
Anyway. I know a few people have been on about how abrasive and angry I am about this issue recently. I have a reason to be. I'm not sorry.
@tiffanyreisz well that explains a lot about Nora ;)
If you want systemic change, you can't clutch your pearls at the people making that happen. Change is often brutal and ugly.
@tiffanyreisz Oh, the ever-flowing anger of the white male on the internet.
Cause if you're down w/ feminism and you're down w/ diverse voices, but only if they talk in a way you approve of, you're not actually down.
Maybe take a step back and ask yourself where that anger is coming from before you tell marginalized people to be nicer to you.
Kindness is good. But when marginalized folks rise up about a thing &amp; your response is "say that nicer or shh," that's part of the problem.
Thinking about the women in YA I know who have gotten rape and death threats and been called names, wondering where #keepYAkind was for them
It is a truth universally acknowledged that librarians leave the most thought-provoking comments
My dog's irritation with the mere fact of the vacuum's existence exceeds any irritation felt by any other living thing on the planet
@OliviaKelly_ @suleikhasnyder @AlishaRai @ReginaSmall @FarrahRochon @KwanaWrites *tips hat*
@pronounced_ing Yeah must be so hard to have these brown people and women talking out loud at you and whatnot
@bobbymathews it's weird and trolly and not work getting upset about
*gets to paragraph in that Telegraph article about how WNDB is a problem, realizes she's being trolled, closes window, eats soup*
@artistajax -unrealistic expectations placed on women (who still do most of the housework, even though most of them work) etc.
@artistajax Well, the stuff doesn't work, unless you use it like twice a week. And who has time for that? And then I got into the-
No you spent 30 minutes in the aisle of Target pondering the feminist implications of all-natural oven cleaner
@ComicsAndNoir SO brutal. Feels kind of mean. I mean I know she's not a real person, but JEEZ.
@fuzzytypewriter I get that variants are supposed to be, ya know, variant, but it's so antithetical to what the current book is.
@fuzzytypewriter it makes me kind of sick to my stomach
holy not OK Batgirl variant cover #eessh
Here’s something I don’t understand - rj-anderson: A few months ago, when Stacey Jay made the... 
@raihanaaaa RIGHT?? Where did all that water come from? They were a traveling band after all. So many questions.
"where's George oh are you SRSLY taking another bath right now" this has been Bible study with Amanda
@RebeccaSchinsky it's actually cheering me bit- it's SO WEIRD AND FUNNY but not on purpose
"When a man has an emission [o_O] he must bathe his whole body with water" yo we are in the DESERT son
@RebeccaSchinsky Heeeee I'm doing a Bible in a year thing. Leviticus is hard going. Lots of talk of emissions and washing.
Leviticus is like a list of rules from your fussiest aunt. Don't touch that or that or that don't even SIT ON IT or THINK ABOUT IT
@mrbowers @JessiSheron They can pretend what they want! But being blocked on one stream should be a hint that I don't care about it?
@nebrinkley They are SO annoying
@JessiSheron @mrbowers Right! Like, do you think my day is gonna be different? I'm just gonna eat food &amp; watch Parks &amp; Rec like always.

Do people really think there aren't enough books telling boys' stories because hold on while I direct you to the entire western canon
@kelsapellet Thank you! I did go on quite a tear yesterday, heh
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot @RebeccaSchinsky Your reaction to a fully-clothed woman is your deal.
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot @RebeccaSchinsky -appropriate image makes YOU feel b/c the girl is too pretty for YOU.
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot @RebeccaSchinsky Yeah, I don't see how that's possible? You're uncomfortable w/ how a perfectly-
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot @RebeccaSchinsky The image is 100% appropriate. It's relevant, she's not naked. Issue here is yours.
@readingtheend Amen to that.
@samkasse Oh God that book is so hard. I totally understand.
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot -too cute for you. Get over it.
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot And I take complete umbrage at the idea that a woman *shouldn't* be included in media b/c she's-
@ChaseHairston @thejeffoneal @BookRiot I picked that image b/c she is writing. Your PERSONAL feelings of sexual attraction to her are YOURS.
Interesting question: what topics in books can you just not read about? For me, it's child abuse: 
@Debbie_Kinsey Ohhhhh that makes sense, I guess. Jeez dudes, get a hobby.

What is the purpose of a spam bot sending you 200 followers who don't ever talk? An ego boost? Magnanimous bot?
@mertymarg it's so good
@estellasrevenge I would 100% watch a daily soap about the Bronte sisters and their weird drunk brother
@agentsaba Ahhhhh best
@estellasrevenge Charlotte would be so good at it. She makes that face a lot, apparently.
@estellasrevenge JOEY!
@triceratops23 "Oh really tell me more about how Moby-Dick is actually a metaphor"
@MariCBecker Aww, thank you! Appreciate it.
Caption this portrait of Charlotte Bronte. I'll start. "Ew." 
@_MatthewStewart @hughcmcbride Ha! That is true.
It's not hard to tell the difference b/t someone genuinely asking and someone just trying to get you to waste your time arguing with them.
And like, I'm not trying to be a smart-ass. But you have to take responsibility for your own education about oppression, folks.
sometimes you just have to respond to comments with 
@thejeffoneal @RebeccaSchinsky live stream! live stream! live stream!
@thejeffoneal 
@SarahWAZZU @BookRiot @bookmobility -that they're not upset about the right things. We get that you don't agree.
@SarahWAZZU @BookRiot @bookmobility We're not really down with telling other women, who have written the majority of the criticism of Smith
@keynosabe This is literally what's about to happen at our house right now. ICE CREAM. ALL OF IT. IN PREPARATION.
@writerrhiannon Thank you, I appreciate it!
@mar_de_palabras Right? Hard to parse.
@jeantt_solo @thebeercolonel DIDN'T KNOW THAT SO EXCITED NOW
@thebeercolonel Oh yeah! With Matt Damon!
@sarahmaclean @RebeccaSchinsky RIGHHHHTTT like it's books
I love getting texts from friends who are in the middle of books I've rec'd (this one's THE MARTIAN) 
@RebeccaSchinsky @hwheaties It's not at all.
@hwheaties @RebeccaSchinsky You shouldn't feel obligated to do anything that scares you.
@RebeccaSchinsky @sarahmaclean and I sure as shit don't check in to foursquare
@sarahmaclean @RebeccaSchinsky It just never occurred to him.
@sarahmaclean @RebeccaSchinsky When we bought our house, I made my husband take down all his pics of the front b/c the # was visible.
@RebeccaSchinsky Yeah totes, I'm like BATHING in the male attention
I've had to change how I live my life b/c of threats I've gotten *from other book people.* It's not "drama." This is not high school.
@DaveCarr Yeah, lots of magic, medieval setting (but actually the future? so that's neat)
It's not thrilling. I am sometimes scared for my kids, for myself. So maybe check that noise before you say it again.
-in publishing, we're doing it for fun, or for attention, or for a thrill. But we know that it's going to result in abuse. It's not fun.
Guys, let's have a moment of real talk. I've seen a lot of people-including women- saying that when other women get angry about sexism-
@DaveCarr It's VERY HIGH fantasy
@KarenaFagan I GASPED out loud because I am a lame-o
VERY. EXCITING. BOOKMAIL. 
“@jennIRL: this is pretty exactly how i feel: 
@bobbymathews shhhhhhhhhhhh
@AlyssitActivity I am 100% there lulz
@triceratops23 ugghhh how am I supposed to love him now
I guess a state investigation is as close to an impartial opinion on the subject as we're going to get, really.
The state of Alabama has closed the investigation into possible elder abuse of Harper Lee: 
@bobbymathews ha, well I appreciate the anger :)
@AlyssitActivity I like to think he would've devested his business of all immoral stuff etc
@bobbymathews Jesus, my family, whiskey, donuts, in that order
@bonjourcass Ahhhh congrats!
@shaycranmer I would totally believe that
@jenna_goodall THANK YOU
@bethrenaldi It's like...it's the chin cleft thing
@StephofLegends YES. YES. And maybe the hair
Anyway let's talk about something fun. Margaret Atwood's new book has a cover and I SWEAR that's Anne Hathaway: 
@bobbymathews yeah it's something, that's for sure
@bobbymathews for realsies
@hughcmcbride @RebeccaSchinsky @thejeffoneal ehmehgerd his little hat
humanism to the left
@kateschatz God they all just bleed together at this point
it takes such courage to write a thing criticizing woman who are in the daily trenches of feminism and then accept praise from other dudes
wow so many brave white guys braving all over Twitter they're so brave standing up for reason and telling women what's what
@SongOfMyShelf I don't know why I've never even THOUGHT about this before. BAD ME.
@balletbookworm this is the best sentence in twitter history
@BethFishReads @JessicaTBTP Yeah it never occurred to me to consider it. But now I'm all *side-eye* to Darcy
@balletbookworm Yeah I didn't love S&amp;S, and didn't read the NA. But I've got EMMA and am gonna give it a go!
@balletbookworm get it gurl, I don't want it to be true
@Drunk_Austen How dare you suggest a historically accurate and probably true thing! (....)
@MarijaynSays Yeah, makes sense. I never thought to ask.
@balletbookworm Ohhh no I think Sittenfeld is doing the P&amp;P
ohhh interesting question: did Mr. Darcy's fortune come from the slave trade?  
@McMullan73 haaaa so would I!
@thejeffoneal I mean I love a HP listicle as much as the next 30 year old lady, but
@runwithskizzers her face when she says "choke on the balls" ahhahahahaha
That's real talk, y'all. If we were in this for the big dollars it'd be all Harry Potter listicles, every day, all day
@KarenaFagan "I want a man in the streets but a beast in the bed" is where I lost it
I mean RT @thejeffoneal: What’s hilarious is that some people think that @bookriot makes MORE money because we write about feminism.
I love Sarah Michelle Gellar but Belle totally wins this princess rap battle: 
@soniavaillant @mittenstrings @RebeccaSchinsky I am stealing that GIF so hard
@SuperHeroSweets you're barking up the wrong tree here buddy
@SuperHeroSweets funny cause most feminists don't give a shit how men find it
@sarahmaclean @bookmobility 
@beth_bernobich I mean AMEN
@RebeccaSchinsky if you criticize any men FIFY
@KarenaFagan @kellysue ehmehgerd dream
@thebooksluts Not overly, just in all the wrong ways.
@thebooksluts *inhales peace, exhales rage, inhales peace, exhales rage*
I'm not here to coddle you and remind you that you're the center of the goddamned universe. I'm here to GET A JOB DONE. &lt;/endrant&gt;
And I realize that it's a newsflash to a lot of men that feminism isn't actually about them or their feelings. But I'm not your mother.
@NyashaJunior The white ladies know what's best for ALL of us after all
@sarahmaclean I'm a vibrating ball of angst right now, so you're probably righttttt
I'm sure feminism would go farther if all the loud women were just nicer to all the men, and let you speak for us. That's not feminism.
@sarahmaclean I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN
Like, I'm sorry if women in the book world are too loud or opinionated and that you wish we said different things. But also? Fuck off.
The past 24 hours have just been dudes telling me how to feminist and I am 100% done-zo
@nevernever_more it's one step away from uppity amirite
@nevernever_more I'm like "abrasive"? Honey. Come sit by me and see what it's REALLY like. #abrasiveasfuck
*swipes left*
When white dudes tell you to check your privilege and in the same breath call you abrasive I just 
@KarenaFagan um yes
@tracygee_ 
I mean what it's boiled down to is women can't criticize a male author w/out getting threats and being called names, end of story.
