All about my freshly dyed #redhair. 
Best day in a long time visiting one of my oldest friends in #NYC. Loved our  spontaneous choice to see #JerseyBoys. Amazing show!
All Timehop does on a daily basis is remind me what a hopeful, optimistic romantic I used to be. May have become a bit cynical since then.
@pallotti oh damn, truth bomb
When we know what we want we forget what we need.
Maybe you needed a change,  and maybe I was in the way. And maybe some things they stay,  and some things go away.  
#Truelife: I have a lip stain addiction.
Whenever I've given up on men, @NevSchulman does something adorable. #gamechanger #Catfish
@StephanieDS85 @CatfishMTV I'm loving this one too! SO sweet. I love when good things happen to good people.
This kid on #Catfish is so level-headed, optimistic and sweet. I don't think anyone has been so calm. His mama should be proud.
The cutest episode of #NewGirl just ended with my favorite song. #RiversandRoads  &lt;3
Say something about me--get an earful and some moderate cowering. Say something about my friends-- regret the day you were born.
Exactly 4 years ago today! WHYYYY? :(  
Just casually measured my dining table by laying face down on the floor next to it. #resourceful #movingproblems
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody. Officially #ZUMBA certified!
You know when a choice is terrible for you but too enjoyable to deny? Like chocolate cake or too many margaritas? Pretty much where I'm at.
This is my life. #workaholic

@winewankers Happy #WineWednesday !! 
Just got a surge in followers related to #food, #travel and #wine. Umm all my favorite things. Let's all be best friends.
Less than a week until I'm #ZUMBA certified. I don't know if the world is ready.
#Springcleaning and packing has me a smidge delirious. Just told my suitcase aloud, "Don't worry. We'll find a spot for you, little buddy."
I dream of a world where women can run errands without being hit on while buying laundry detergent and aluminum foil.
I was wise beyond my years via @timehop  
When men want to date real, independent women with their acts together not girls, let me know. In the meantime, I'll be over here killin' it
Rainbow cookies are my everything.
When you're at the office on a Sunday: -____________-
I'm exhausted after a crazy news week, yet here I am at 1 a.m. on Buzzfeed, YouTube and Twitter. #whoops
Just took the plunge &amp; signed up for #ZUMBAINSTRUCTOR  training in May. Some serious shimmying &amp; booty popping coming to a gym near you :-P
To everyone listing apts for rent in #FairfieldCounty, fix your ugly 70s tile bathrooms. You're cheap, and we're paying a lot to live here.
@jimmyfallon lip syncing  "Like a Prayer" is officially my spirit animal. #LipSyncBattle
Whoever said #blackcats are unlucky clearly hadn't met mine. I'm going to miss this little guy so much.  &lt;3 
Peanut butter is the way to my heart, and I'm not even ashamed.
"Beyoncé's my spiritual twin. Those tickets are my birthright." I just love @Brooklyn99FOX.
Does anyone else kind of just....hate emojis?
My love for @celinedion...it's all coming back to me now.
"$10,000 bottle of wine, by the way. Goes great with the Spaghettios." Already love this show.#LastManOnEarth
If there's anything I've learned this past year, it's that crappy people gravitate towards crappy people. So I'm flattered to be left out.
New #Catfish episode makes up for all the horrible parts of today. YESSSS! @hill_roseanne11
I just realized I haven't seen a single movie nominated for #Oscars2015. Soo. Why am I even watching?
@jijjabear One of our best kept secrets ;)
@jijjabear not gonna lie, that works wonders! Hahaha
Sabrina on #BigWomenBigLove is a SAINT.  She handles everything so gracefully. I'm not far from NYC so we should probably be best friends.
@MaristDiversity Thanks for the awesome shout out! I've been at my tech PR job since I graduated in May '13 so I'm still writing &amp; dancing!
Heat isn't working at my office and barely can keep up with these Arctic temps at my apartment. Winter....you stop it.
@theflogblog @fitgirlsguide Staying on track! :) I have a fitness goal I'm working toward, and I'm using a food and exercise tracking app.
Finished my 28-day @fitgirlsguide  challenge yesterday &amp; feel great! Def keeping up what I learned.  Fridge oats &amp; lunch bowls foreverrr
DJM FOREVER "@PokJournal: Marist College president Murray announces retirement 
I really want a pet, and I don't know what to do with these emotions. #helpIneedsomebody
Now accepting #Valentine applications...OMG EVERYONE CALM DOWN, NO SHOVING. YOU! NO STAMPEDING. Good lord.
Listening to "Thinking Out Loud," and when Ed Sheeran says "evergreen" all I can ever think of are evergreen PR opps. 0_0 #PRproblems #HELP
A lot of my friends/family don't get what I cover at work. This @WSJ piece sums it up: 
Ever use the NY #MetroCard, Bay Area #ClipperCard, London #OysterCard, etc.? Follow @CubicTS, which works on these systems! #transit
My crock pot and I have become one.
Ever find yourself just side-eyeing a house for its poor taste in #Christmas lights? Because I was throwing mad shade on my drive home.
"Buzz, your girlfriend. WOOF." Ah,  #holiday movies just never get old.  #HomeAlone
@MattMcAndrew should just become a member of @falloutboy. This performance is amazing. #VoiceFinale
"The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you." @Hozier is killing it on @NBCTheVoice  right now. #VoiceFinale
Never thought this time last year that this is what my life would look like,  but I'm shockingly zen about it all.
Whoever decided it was a good idea to incorporate country music and fiddling motions into zumba should be euthanized.
A four-day weekend in my world means obsessively trying NOT to check my work email. #prproblems
The other day I called my childhood house  my parents' and my apartment my home.  Only took a year and a half! #adultlife
#VoiceSaveJessie
Happy to see my votes helped keep my favorite artist around on @NBCTheVoice. @lukewademusic, I was in no way ready to see you go. Congrats!
@claudcaruso @bryanadams No do share!
I still love you,  @lukewademusic! :) One of my favorite songs sung by the best singer on the show.
My Mary Poppins &amp; 50s housewife costumes may have been ironic....UNTIL NOW. Spending my day cleaning and making beef stew. Ohh yeah.
I just turned on Magic Mike during the "It's Raining Men" scene. AMEN.
I got that red lip, classic thing that you like.
#Inspiration for the day: Every pizza is a personal pizza if you believe in yourself.
Well. Found my future husband. #TheVoice 
When a Syncopated Lady comments on a tap video you're in...*dies of happiness*
All my friends are getting engaged or married, and I'm just over here like mmmmm #Reeses.
"God Only Knows" by The Beach Boys will forever make me tear up.
You know you did a good job decorating your bedroom when you're still happy every single time you look around. #design #TheLittleThings
May or may not have teared up during Belle and Rumple's first dance.  #OnceIsFrozen #taleasoldastime
Bought my second #RolandMouret dress from @BananaRepublic. It's like they were made for me.  Someone take me on a hot date so I can wear it!
Emma Watson's publicist must be having the BEST day.
I can't even describe the confusion and distress that appeared on my face as I watched the Little Caesar's pretzel pizza commercial....
I'm gonna go right ahead and say I'm tired of always being the consolation prize. For once, I want to be someone's gold medal.
#WhyIStayed...everyone saw his angelic side &amp; wouldn't believe me. I thought it was a phase and our love was enough to change it. It wasn't.
Not gonna lie, "That's the Way It Is" by Celine Dion is playing in my hotel lobby right now, and it's getting me pretty pumped up.
Using my day off to take myself on a date. :) Shopping, lunch, and maybe even nails. Sometimes a day alone is just what you need.
I just made the best enchiladas of my life. Omg I'm dying. #foodcoma
And all of my friends want to get into heaven, and all I keep thinking is I wish you were here #thegaslightanthem
This song is definitely something I needed to hear. Sometimes people forget the battles others are fighting 
"Tell me about it, stud" will forever be one of my favorite lines from any movie ever. #Grease
Just wore my pajama shorts backwards for a solid hour. It was that kind of day...looks like my #vacation arrived just in time.
"It's a somber occasion, and all my tops are too joyful." #storyofmylife #modernfamily
Today has been the textbook definition of a Manic Monday. I could just skip the gym and go straight to the wine, right?
Facebook is now giving me advertisements for every online dating site known to man. I already know how single I am, FB. Relax.
Keep hearing them but haven't actually seen a single firework yet. Such a cruel joke.
Sam Smith always warms my heart. 
"And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy. Maybe it's you. On your own. Picking up the pieces and starting over."
I really needed this peaceful day, paddle boarding, swimming and meeting new people with my best friend..so content right now.

I needed to see Begin Again like yesterday. Who's coming with me?
"All of our girlfriends are smarter than us." Preach, Nev! #catfish
Curled up watching my favorite movie, Across the Universe, after an amazing summer Sunday! :)
Today, I used my shoe as a hammer. #movingproblems
Maybe time will tell you why I've got so much hell to sell you.
If it's a broken part, replace it; if it's a broken arm then brace it; if it's a broken heart then face it.
@MissAbbeyMcD seriously you made the best mix ever!
Never let your fear decide your fate.
I've been putting out fires all my life. Everybody wants a flame, but they don't want to get burned.
The best revenge is to be happy.
Accident at the crosswalk in front of my office. Luckily no one hurt, but it was only a matter of time. Almost get run over everyday there!
@MaristDiversity Wow, thank you for the shout out! Couldn't have gotten here without my experience at Diversity Works. :)
Making moves &amp; overcoming obstacle after obstacle. I don't know how I've made it this far after what I've gone through, but I'm doing it. :)
"Can we stop with the #Kale propaganda?" -@JimGaffigan PREACH. #Obsessed
I didn't know I had to take at least one #selfie per day and constantly look for attention to be considered attractive.
I haven't been that spontaneous in eight years. What an amazing night!
@JohnnyGrimmer Thank you so much! :)
#promoted :)
@hill_roseanne11 What?? I'm there for work as we speak.  :-P Must. Stalk.
@KelseyOdom I was just thinking of this the other day. Amazing! :)
@luisdile02 :-O
@helpareporter Is the answer to the riddle alarm clock? :) Happy Monday!
But I still stay because you're the only thing I know.
This week is going to go by so slow. I just want to see my friends for my birthday! #countingdown #nobodylikesyouwhenyoure23
@hmalc52291 obviously! I'll add to it before I see you!
@hmalc52291 I have all these ideas and nowhere to get them out. I started a little number to "Timber" :-p
To start a tap YouTube channel or not to start a tap YouTube channel. That is the question.
As much as I am loving Breaking Bad as I finally catch up, I just can't deal with all of the ill fitting sweatshirts.
Chili is cooking in the crock pot on this rainy Sunday!
Data breach. That's #mykindofholiday.
Totally thought #Anchorman2 came out on Christmas. WELL IT'S AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR ME. #Datenight just got a whole lot better.
Celine Dion and Ne-Yo? An unlikely but amazing duo. @NBCTheVoice #VoiceFinale
@NBCTheVoice #SequinOnesie needs to start trending.
Hearing James and Matt sing again on #thevoice finale is killing me. Should have been in the final three. :(
Excellent article on #biometrics: 
My dad just called me a "tough little shit" for surviving that terrible drive. Compliment?
I love Ice-T's informational tidbits slipped into normal conversation on #SVU.
If you work out and don't share it on social media, did you still burn the calories?
@klanzaaa Mine too. &lt;3 Even if I don't have semesters at work...haha Don't make me miss you more.
I'm actually obsessed. 
@klanzaaa I MISS YOU (U?) TOO. &lt;3 The short amount of time I saw you a couple weeks ago was just not enough.
@klanzaaa I never tweet, but whenever I do, you are always right there to favorite it. :-p hahaha
Just made my first student loan payment. It has begun. #woof #whydidIgotoaprivatecollege
Grateful for my job, my family, my friends, my apartment &amp; the fact that I get to see Marc every day after 3.5 years of being long distance!
Happy #Thanksgiving! May we all drink enough to forget the obscene amounts of food we consume...so we can have more later.
@zakariah Except he also had hot dogs hahaha #nojudgment
@zakariah hahaha right? This all started because I noticed he didn't eat the homemade chicken pot pie I left him...and that's what he chose
"My french fries were taking too long to cook so I had to make the mozzarella sticks while I waited." -My boyfriend. #firstworldproblems
As much as I love #TheVoice, I was really feeling a new episode of #Blacklist. Curse you, NBC.
Amazing to see another curvy girl tap dancing her butt off and breaking stereotypes. Must see: 
It was amazing having @JessHasapis and @GinaRoseSirico over to my apartment and bringing them to new restaurants. #missedyou
I tweet so much for my clients at work that I forget to tweet for myself. #prproblems
@helpareporter Is the answer post office? :)
@jasonneeson @andthenicried @AlaynaGrazianI Got Georgia on my mind.
@MsEmmaRosee Aw Emma! You made my day. Miss you and tap too much! I wish choreographing tap for MCDE could be my side job. :(
@DanaMurano @meg_mahones @kara_skrillex @acesa5 @graetzer1 Miss you all too :-(
"We mustn't lose tap." -#Sytycd. Yes! Thank you, Aaron, for representing us tappers this season.
#4pmcrash. Is that a thing? Because I'm feeling it.
When you're doing follow up calls and all you get are voicemail boxes. #prproblems
I really wish my body could handle coffee like a man. I could use some. #2pmcrash
What a happy little demon shark! #aliensharks
Every Discovery special is inconclusive. From mermaids to megalodons to shark serial killers. What gives? #sharkweek #disappointing
Why so serious, shark? #sharkweek
@Chel____Sea Someone got some air!
@Chel____Sea Can you imagine us watching it together? Disaster. Lol
Oh good. Great whites can dislocate their jaws to fit more food. That's comforting. #sharkdown #sharkweek
I swear if Amy gets sent home, I'll scream. #sytycd
#Megalodon makes its own rules.
@bmcmillan07 haha it is a bad week to be a seal, after all.
Not a #megalodon. Just megalodon. There can only be one, apparently.
#Megalodon. Just because I can. But seriously glad this is a unique special, not just breaching sharks (though I love that too).
So many fireflies outside my apartment. :)
"It is what it is" is not a valid excuse. Sorry, every #catfish ever.
Sassy, sassy Nev. #catfish
@Chel____Sea if you told my mom I watch it, she'd be proud lol she loves it
@Chel____Sea @MissAbbeyMcD I somewhat participated haha
Get ALL the Google Alerts! #prproblems
@Chel____Sea MAKE ME
#honeybooboo is starting tap classes. Yes! Best friends!
Model and won't video chat? Oldest story in the book. #catfish
@MissAbbeyMcD Aw yes please. I think it premieres this Sunday too!
Imagine if R.Levorne walked out when they introduced Derek, and Nev was just like, "We catfished America," dropped the mic &amp; left. #catfish
@lschultz20 yes! :):) your name is good luck apparently hahaha
Finally, #Catfish. Finally. My dreams were not crushed at long last.
Nev is basically getting catfished by someone who was getting catfished. #Catfish inception.
Came home from work and started to make dinner, and Marc started doing the laundry without even thinking. #productive #goodboyfriend
Cilantro is my arch nemesis. Watching Diners, Drive-ins &amp; Dives. Everything looked so good, but they kept adding that green devil.
@AEAbrams Thanks! :-D I'm working at a public relations firm!
Just noticed my hipster friends from HS all deleted 99% of their FB friends except their ex-gf (ironically) and like one teacher. #sooocool
@hill_roseanne11 Look less like a murderer then try again, buddy. #catfish
@AEAbrams Thank you! :) I'm a real person now and have a job and apartment! Whattt? Haha I'll be taking a tap workshop this summer too!
I want one #catfish where every single thing is completely true, and it just freaking ends in marriage. Is that so much to ask?
I knew Gladys seemed shady and clingy. That is messed up. #catfish
@AEAbrams  Awww stop. You're the cutest. Missing tap and you &lt;3!
@thatgirlneenz I watched it too! The mom obviously liked glitter in name and dress alike haha
I was asked if I was Japanese today. I'll always wonder why so many people think I'm Asian, but I'll admit I sort of understand. #almondeyes
Moving into my apartment next week! Just have to figure out how I'm going to fit all my clothes. OOPS.
Working from home today then apartment hunting all day tomorrow. I just want to know where I'm livingggg.  #realworld
There's no rest for the wicked. Already started my job and will be in Westport 'til Friday. Can't wait to be here full time in an apartment!
@lnp1144 Oooh good point about the traffic. Keeping Stamford in mind for sure! You're the best :-D Can't wait to hear about your success!
@katelynfornaro Thanks, Katelyn! :-D It's all moving so fast, but I'm excited. Just missing Marist already!
@lnp1144 Thank you, love! I'll be in a hotel this week then am hoping to be moved in no later than the 17th! Hope I find a place :)
Starting my job tomorrow and on the hunt for an apartment. Real life came out of nowhere!
@klanzaaa TOO LATE I'M HOME haha
Well, it's finally hitting me. I am a Marist College graduate and am on my way to a new career and chapter in my life. Miss it already. &lt;3
@abbeyscalia Thanks so much, Abbey! Congrats on graduation as well. We did it! :)
@jasonneeson It starts at one, but it's kinda a stop by whenever thing lol
@lschultz20 Thanks so much! Love you! :) congrats on your master's!!
@jasonneeson Thanks!! :) had a rainy graduation, but it's all good! Can't wait to see youuu
@jasonneeson The job is in Westport so I need to move down near the shore!
@lnp1144 I do! :) I'm trying to find something outside of Westport apartment-wise but still nearby! See you soon in this rain. Woof lol
@lnp1144 Thank you! :-D It's in Westport so I'll be moving to Southern CT near you and Gina!
Graduation tomorrow! Can't sleep since my room doesn't feel like my room with everything packed away. #gradproblems
@MissChelsea3491  hahahahaha Oh my god. I'm so happy someone else caught that and enjoyed it as much as I did.
Couldn't announce it over FB because my mom wants to surprise my relatives, but I accepted a PR job! :) Looks like I'm moving soon! #finally
So. many. bug bites.
@lschultz20 I even cried reading reviews of it! Not okay. Forgot how attached I really was to them.
May or may not have cried during the #OfficeFinale. Michael, Erin's parents, Jim &amp; Pam, the wedding, Kevin, the baby, Kelly &amp; Ryan. #love
I'm working my tail off, yet I'm becoming fluent in rejection. #sigh
The waiting game is my least favorite game!
YES. 
@hill_roseanne11 VICTORY. haha And no Pallotti gathering would be the same without an appearance from you!
@hill_roseanne11 I graduate next Saturday so I have a week and a half left!  My mom is having a grad dinner May 27. COME! :)
@hill_roseanne11 Can we go sometime when we are both back? Do you graduate this weekend? Miss you!
@lschultz20  I approved. I always knew there was a connection between Bay and Neverland! Should have seen Henry coming though! And yes! &lt;3
#onceuponatime was intense this week. I predicted parts of it but definitely was surprised.
One door closed, but I hope another opens for me! Can't believe graduation is in less than two weeks now. Can't wait for the real world!
Just had my last day interning. They said I was a coworker more than an intern. I'll miss it, but I hope more positives are on the horizon.
@vehuntsinger Thanks, Tori! :)
I'm feeling optimistic for the first time in awhile.
Even though I'm done with MCDE forever (#heartbreak), I'm going to choreograph tap to "Gone, Gone, Gone" by Phil Phillips anyway.
Got my professional headshots! Finally have nice pics for LinkedIn and Twitter. Thanks, @xNicolettec!  #jobhunting
Adobe Creative Suite will be the death of me.
Why does all the clothing that's "in" this summer look like it's from an episode of Clarissa Explains it All?
Best four years of my life thanks to #mcde. Love my tappers!
Last dance show ever :( Love mcde &lt;3 #dareyoutomove
On that IcyHot flow. #hellweek #DareYoutoMove @MaristDance
This is the first time I've ever gotten a good apple in a Marist to-go lunch. I'm kind of excited about it. #momentousoccasion
@DanaMurano I just wanted to be on the twitter feed  :-P still want that seat cushion
Welcome class of 2017! Can't believe I'm graduating in a month. I'll miss Marist too much. Enjoy your amazing four years! #maristopenhouse
You know things aren't going well when you have to start repeating the mantra from #TheHelp to yourself.
@kelliehayden yes please! :) I'll shoot you a message soon!
@hill_roseanne11 haha thanks! :) The one good thing that's happened lately.
@kelliehayden Haha good to know! If you have any advice about looking for jobs in the CT area, I'd love to hear it/I need it. :-p
@lschultz20 thank you! &lt;3 can I see you like now lol miss you
@kelliehayden Thank you!! :) this is getting way too real haha
Graduating Summa Cum Laude! Is this real life?
@hill_roseanne11 I agree. I don't like this one bit. P.s. Ever heard the saying white girls can't jump? Hahaha
@MissChelsea3491 I'm not gonna say I survived. I'm gonna say I thrived.
@ktweet23 I beat out 300+ people to be a finalist for a Marketing/Comm. position and just got my rejection yesterday..I think that's why
My creativity is becoming a negative in my job hunt. I initially thought companies would like an analytical person with a creative   side...
@hill_roseanne11 don't remind me hahaha
@hill_roseanne11 I'm not sure yet! I don't think so since break just ended a few days ago. Can't decide!
@MissChelsea3491 you sure you didn't accidentally do that already? Haha
@kaileeeeeeee Yes. Yes. Yes.
Today is one of those days when I just need a hug.
This magazine layout &amp; design class will be the death of me. Thank god I have an awesome partner! @KelseyOdom
#Tap is an intricate art form. I'm so tired of hearing people undermining it as a dance style. #mypassion
@hmalc52291 I've been snapchatting @klanzaaa to ease the pain haha
@hmalc52291 Pumped! :) #missyou
@hmalc52291 you should be here watching it with me! #lonely lol
Back at Marist early to volunteer at an event for my internship in the morning. Just watched #perksofbeingawallflower by myself. #amazing
Wedged sneakers? Make it stop. #fashionpolice
@lnp1144 My Google Alerts pop up at 2 a.m. and give me nightmares. #yaysteroids
@lnp1144 Aw shucks :-p You know I'm in. #Iactuallyhaveafuturenow WOO
@lnp1144 I know you're counting down the minutes. #lancearmstrong #impossibleassignments
@lnp1144 Beautiful! That will be your future home someday. #letsbehonest
Just when I tell myself to go to bed, I end up on #buzzfeed with 12 tabs open. Every. Time.
@lschultz20 Especially when Pam interviewed at the real estate agency with the boss just like Michael lol Wahh
@lschultz20 He is Michael Scott in real life. Haha I love it
I just want to carry Ross Matthews around in my pocket. #Chelsealately
Even though it snowed, I am still going to get my free @RitasItalianIce tomorrow for the first day of spring!
@hollyvanwyck You're eating your own brother? &lt;/3
I may not have had the money to go on a fancy spring break trip, but I did have the $3.79 to buy Mini Cadbury Eggs. #littlevictories
I forgot how sad Water for Elephants is. Hadn't read it or watched the movie in quite some time. #casuallycrying
Home on my spring break while all my friends are on vacations, and it snows. #typical
@DanaMurano @NamelessEm7 @GinaRoseSirico I'm a force to be reckoned with  :-P hahaha
@NamelessEm7 @GinaRoseSirico @DanaMurano Yesss. I definitely wanna go back when I don't have to drive three hours the next morning Bahaha
Today my friend watched some of my past tap dances and told me I could choreograph for a living. #ifonly
MCDE Behind the Curtain is swiftly approaching 6,000 views! Check out our new articles: 
Another salsa piece has been uploaded to the blog by @GinaRoseSirico! 

Check out Sam Gabriele's story about choreographing this semester! 
Good thing the door jams so you can't open it w/ a key, &amp; none of my housemates ever hear the doorbell while I stand in the sleet. #sweet
Maybe your work will love you when I'm just not there to hold you.
Assisting in packing the house for the first time since freshman year. #maristwhiteout
@hill_roseanne11 Lmao count on Laurie and Donna to keep us up to date on each other's lives. But yes! Fingers crossed it all goes well. EEK
@meganmarusak bahahaha Someone thought my friend met her when they saw me in a picture. LOLWUT
And I was just told I could be Demi Lovato's clone. That's a new one. #Icanrollwithit
Just had my first phone interview for a real person job. Eek!
@KelseyOdom The parentheses are lifechanging. #notembarrassed
@AEAbrams I miss you too! It's not too late to join my class. :-p Trust me...the dance show is way more fun than Bardavon. haha
Absolutely loved #identitythief! Great night out with the housemates after being snowed in.
That awkward moment when you get chocolate on your white shirt while interning. All hail #tidetogo.
Sign ups didn't go the way I planned, but I've never been so excited to teach a tap class. I want to blow everyone away my last semester.
There were a lot of sad/difficult parts to this weekend but a lot of amazing parts too. I should focus on those instead.
I'm sensing some shady business.
Every single meeting I have this week for my activities are all at the same time. Sacrifices must be made. Hint: @maristdance always wins.
The one time you'll hear, "let's go to Bridgeport." #catfish #CT
@liz_zy17 @BridesmaidsTalk @MissChelsea3491 @katieedaugherty hahahah Can't to wait to see you guys tonight!
@liz_zy17 @BridesmaidsTalk @MissChelsea3491 @katieedaugherty
@em_telli Rebel.
@K_Murphxx Not going to lie, I do it by accident constantly...then later I realize I liked it and feel like a douche. haha
@MissAbbeyMcD @MissChelsea3491 @liz_zy17 But wait let's hang out.
I enjoy that #catfish has become a verb.
"I feel bad I didn't call you on your birthday, but grandpa and I were gambling at the casino." -My grandmother. #legitexcuse
Longest wait ever for my birthday dinner. Hope it's worth it. Haha
@AudraDiers haha thanks so much! I'll definitely be making the best of it :)
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
@hmalc52291 Thank you, darling! I love youuuuuu! Can't wait to see you!
@klanzaaa Thanks, love! :) Can't wait to see you when we get back!
@chaas991 Aw, thanks girl! &lt;3 Can't wait to get back and see all of my favorite dancers! :) Love you!
Well, it's my 22nd birthday! The first of many insignificant birthdays to come! Haha #celebrate
@marincleary haha Aw man! It was a fun class. But I've lost motivation too! I think it's because I realize vacation is ending.
I have so much choreography done for MCDE auditions. #oops #somenights
@marincleary I'm forcing myself to go to Zumba at 6 if you're interested :-p
@MissChelsea3491 Acca'scuse me. You stop these shenanigans.
Face masks with @MissChelsea3491 and @hill_roseanne11 . Looking green. Looking sexy.
@vehuntsinger I was also a fan of "They call Dr.Boolittle." hahaha
@hmalc5229 SAME. Let's get together asap. And yes I will cut your music haha
#missamerica Illinois was my favorite until that dance. Bent knees and unpointed feet? Woof
@SarahLMauro I love how half of them seemed hesitant, and even once they took them, just held them awkwardly hahaha
@meganxmaria no.
#missamerica Coming from a tapper, where's the artistry?
Inglorious Basterds is on. Guess my night just got better!
Waiting for a flu shot at CVS, and a guy behind the counter is clearly showing his stress and making me uncomfortable. So unprofessional.
Saw a midget stand up comedian give an Asian girl a pretty impressive lap dance. I didn't know that was on my bucket list until now.
Great day in NYC with my housemates!

1:40 choreographed to "Some Nights" for @MaristDance. I think this tap number will help me go out with a bang my last semester (hopefully)!
Every day I see people my age getting engaged and having babies. I'm just trying to enjoy my last semester of college. #notreadyforreallife

I finally got a CHI hair straightener. This may seem insignificant, but I am pumped. #thelittlethings
@BrentMorin Glad we did as well. Made my Christmas break a lot better! Have a wonderful holiday!
Great show, and great meeting you tonight, @BrentMorin. Good to know there is hope yet for getting out of CT and being successful. :)
I received  a random act of kindness in honor of Newtown. A girl gave me a little bag of candy and a lovely card. Made my holiday. #26acts
I got a new car. :) Well, a new used car. Now I can actually drive for more than 10 feet without fear of breaking down! #goodlife

@MissAbbeyMcD @liz_zy17 @MissChelsea3491 love you guys!
Finished all work/classes for the fall (including capping). All I have left is one final. Not ready to  be in my last semester. #bittersweet

Check out my capping project with my friend Gina giving a behind the scenes look at @MaristDance! 
Come visit @MaristDance at the activities fair anytime between 3 and 6 :)
Here's another big CARE A LOT to everyone debating politics on Facebook.
Why am I looking for jobs when I don't graduate until May? My ability to do the  opposite of procrastination sometimes amazes even myself.
@comic_mischief Have fun in Germany!  Miss you already! #nolongerslaves
"@estuarypalomino: If you ever feel alone or unwanted, just remember that Mama from #honeybooboo got laid at least 3 times"
@GinaRoseSirico How's our house?
SAVE GLITZY. #honeybooboo
Kids from the Hartford schools are working it in this dance performance. Proud of what my internship helps to provide! #Hartfordperforms

Of course the one time my name is used in a movie it has to be a violent horror film. #hates
Finally home from my nine hour shift. Sad to leave Express until the holidays :(
The Week The Women Went is on next? #score This is going to be so interesting.
Amazing what a small town can do. I may not know Troy, but my younger brother does well. We hope the best for him. #prayfortroy
I just want Truly to be my best friend. And I enjoyed Curt's appearance. #bunheads
Preach it, Wayne. #Roseanneroast And seriously who is Ellen Barkin?
Roseanne looks great. And I can tell Princess Leia is going to be a bitch/poor sport. #Roseanneroast
I was going to go to the gym, but I fell asleep. #oops #mylifeisajoke
One of the women who works in the office at my internship just said she thinks I'm adorable. Aw, shucks!
I haven't been in band since freshman year yet I keep getting emails asking if I'm coming back my senior year. Huh... #no
300 followers. Woo!
No matter how many times I've seen The Blindside I still smile through the whole thing.
@liz_zy17 I love you :) So sad I won't get to come up with Chels! But I'm gonna see you all the time when we get back!
@andthenicried Ted Gibson from What Not to Wear tweeted at me. What did he say...? "XO" hahaha #lifemade
I ate way too much chocolate today. LOL JK #notevenpossible
#notwatchingtheOlympicsliterallyatall but still...#USA
@tedgibson Loved her haircut. I'm always a fan of short, sassy hair! Great job  :-)
Stylish and smart don't need to be separate qualities. Intelligent women should be allowed to have a little sparkle. #wntw
@PatriciaTow Want. That. Lol p.s I miss you.
@liz_zy17 You always will be to me!
Cake Boss is visiting Italy on the episode I'm watching. #takemeback
@jasonneeson Minus all my money going right back to them. :-p But I agree...I like it way too much haha
@hill_roseanne11 He dragged a man INTO a burning building.
Bought everything I've been eyeing with my extra employee discount last night at Express! #byebyepaycheck
So 1 exec of a company represents the views of its employees? I support gay marriage, as well as many of #Chickfila 's employees, I'm sure.
The 1 good thing about Kristen Stewart's affair is that there's no way they can play Ana and Christian in 50 Shades now. #crisisaverted
@hill_roseanne11 So true. I've heard of 2 motorcycle accidents of young people my boss and Marc know in the past, well, week. :(
@pallotti It was Windsor Locks! Someone said she's heard of them in the hotel at the airport...which is probably exactly where it was. Woof
Toddlers and Tiaras is on, and the pageant is two towns over from me. I didn't even know we had this kind of thing here...#embarrassed
@toddwcostello That's what you think :-p but seriously, I didn't know my roommate. We were total opposites yet still became good friends. :)
I'm all for updating people about your successes, but do it tastefully. Every tiny thing doesn't need to be advertised through social media.
@jasonneeson The LG Lucid. I quite like it. :)
Oh hello there! This is my first official tweet from my new smarty phone. #joiningthiscentury #fullyequipped
@GlossyBoxUK I just entered @Sprinkleofglitr 's 15,000 Blog Follower Celebration Giveaway!!! Have you entered yet?! 
Large, mysterious bruise on my left hand, burn on my right hand. #thuglife
@lschultz20 bahah Well aren't you just precious. I miss you too &lt;3 &lt;3
Worked til six then babysat for the rest of the night-- all without one word from the one person I want to hear from.
@lnp1144 Thanks, girl! You're definitely right. &lt;3
Sometimes you have to wonder why people say such hurtful things to the people they love. All I know is I'm tired of it. #laststraw
@MissAbbeyMcD Don't you fret. You know I never will! I'll be in Potown August 24th since I'm helping with freshman move in for dance. :)
@MissAbbeyMcD Seriously, you need to come back into my life. We need to hang out borderline constantly when we get back. #obsessedwithyou
Got called in last minute to help clean up at work til late...and have to be in at 7am for inventory. #sweet #sleepisprettymuchhappening
@jmbrophy Thanks! :) Everyone is really nice there, and of course, the fact that I love the clothes definitely helps.
@jasonneeson It's definitely different at a smaller store. haha Plus I realllllllllly like the clothes I get a discount on sooo
@luisdile02 Public Relations in Puerto Rico?
I actually enjoyed my first day at Express. My personality works well in retail..and hopefully that means it will in PR too. :) #oneyearleft
It creeps me out  that 50 Shades is considered porn for middle aged mothers when the main character is 21 and fresh out of college.
Sprinted to catch my bus from my internship in this heat. The driver left before the bus was even scheduled to arrive. #notokay #heatstroke
Ate too much, was cool enough to be seen in public with my younger brother, and enjoyed an SVU marathon today with @hill_roseanne11. #solid
@lnp1144 Um, that's amazing. haha Congrats! Why do I live on the far away side of CT from NYC? :(
@lnp1144 Thank you. :) What are you up to this summer? Commuting into the city?
@lnp1144 Aw, thanks!  I got a job at the store, Express! I'm excited! I've been interning at a non-profit called Hartford Performs too. :)
Finally got a job! Between interning and work, I should be plenty busy! #finally
What is this, a Nicholas Sparks book? Thanks a lot, Bunheads
@lschultz20 LOVE THAT SHOW. But I share in your frustrations. If I worked at that store, everyone would be leaving dressless/crying. haha
After Twitter gave me a virus/completely crashed my hard drive, I fixed and recovered everything all on my own. #IAmTheSmartestManAlive
@hill_roseanne11 hahahaha Me too. I need to get up at 6:30 too. #basicallysleeping #katyperrywritebettersongs
Vote for my adorable dog, Dakota, to be our local 
@hill_roseanne11 Too bad we watched Toddlers and Tiaras instead. lololol
@BonnieSloo @AnnieFrenz @ktweet23 @lschultz20 @gingeeharrison @sammmmmm3 You're making me depressed... yet I love it. I miss 15A like crazy!
College kids looking for summer jobs are punished for pursuing higher education. You'd rather hire dropouts who can work forever? #goodluck
@hill_roseanne11 bahaha I went hard on that stepper. :-p But I only caught about half of SYTYCD. What I saw was good, though!
Nothing like getting your frustrations out at the gym while watching #SYTYCD
Click this and help @meganxmaria win! 
Note: I am not encouraging this obsession...though that one song is too catchy.
@emitchell002 Ours were definitely the only ones that mattered. We singlehandedly made him win.
Yes! Phillip Phillips won. :) Let's hope he's one of the few idols who end up with actual success.
The magazine I interned for at #Marist this semester. One story I wrote is even the cover feature. Woohoo! 
4.0? #Icanlivewiththat
Poor college students are some of the hardest summer workers you're going to get. Companies need to consider us more often. #hireme
While walking my dog, she somehow managed to find/eat a discarded jelly doughnut hole along the way. #counterproductive #likeownerlikedog
Congrats to the Marist Class of 2012! #marist Can't believe I'll officially be a senior in a couple of hours.
Finding a  job to supplement my barely paid internship is impossible. One would think with such charm and wit, it would be simple. #sigh
@emitchell002 Yes please. :) I responded to your text today, but I'm not sure when you're free. Next week is pretty clear for me!
@meganxmaria Who needs frozen yogurt at 8am...? haha
@emitchell002 I'm home. :) Plans this week? #missyourface
@lschultz20 It was literally the best. She looked borderline immortal, and her voice was unbelievable. I just want to be her best friend.
Still loving how I (the one girl in the family) ended up with the smallest room of 4 when I have the most stuff. #unpackingproblems
Florence + the Machine live at #MoheganSun last night was the most amazing show. I cried for the first 2 songs. Don't worry abut it. #inlove
Pack, study, pack pack pack, study study study, pack. #finals
@ktweet23 I can't even imagine. #wahhh But at least you have a job! #yayyy
Knowing so many friends are about to graduate and that I will be a senior in college in just one week is killing me #wahhh
@luisdile02 @mkurtz424 @klerner Always such a charmer, Luis.
@mkurtz424 @klerner @luisdile02 Stop it, Michael. I'm already emotional. :( haha &lt;3
As I just posted that last Tweet, she put the grades up. VICTORY
If my professor would just post our last assignment grade, I'd be done with this beast of a portfolio paper. #antiprocrastination
@emitchell002 Oh, you. :-p But do you have some news for me? What are we celebrating (besides being amazing)?
Today was that fateful day in Psych of Sleep where our professor gave us free treats from the Culinary Institute #lifelongdream #fat
I'm actually really going to miss @klerner 's Journalism II class. We're just such a dysfunctional bunch.
@emitchell002 I miss you! I was thinking about you the other day. I'll be home in 2 weeks. Let's hang out :)
@lnp1144 hahaha I'm a few paragraphs, the bibliography, and appendices from being done. It's neverending. Kill me.
Final dance meeting for the semester tonight at 9:30 in Donelly 225. See you there!
@klerner is already getting quite a few votes in @luisdile02 's survey. Uh oh.
Thanks to @peoplesrev Kelly Cutrone for coming out to #Marist earlier. As a PR major (though not in fashion), your advice was so helpful!
Thanks for the brownie dana's mom! #Mcde
So close to one thousand tickets. Let's end show weekend right! #Mcde
@BMACtastic Aw thanks so much! :) I heard someone cheer my name and didn't know who. Now I know! So glad you made it out!
@BMACtastic ahahaha Oh my god thanks so much :) Were you there today?
We sold out minus the extra seats we just put out!! Congrats everyone! Enjoy! #Mcde
Hi Marc abbey john and chelsea's family! #mcde
It's almost time! Love all of you dancers. Enjoy the show! #Maristdance
Happy birthday Bill and Brian! #mcde
The board is doing  serious work right now. :) Can't wait for everyone else to arrive! #maristdance
I am struggling on the food front right now in my closet/fridge. Hell week=strangest diet ever. #mcde #loveitanyway
@lnp1144 If I come up with an idea, you'll be the first to know. hahaha Perhaps, I'll just give time management seminars :-p #sadlife
My friend told me that if I started my own company, she would work for me in a second because I'm so on top of my work. Such a compliment :)

We still have tickets for people to purchase at the door! :) Come early on the days of the show and get yours! #maristdance #danceyourstory
@PatriciaTow #wehavenolives
#maristdance WOOHOO TWITTERFEED :) Hope we can get this up and running for the show!
Our 15 Years of Dance: Dance Your Story is approaching so fast. :) #mcde  Lighting rehearsals tomorrow (check if your dance has early!)


Check out my article on the flashmob! #MaristOpenHouse
@MaristDance Dance Your Story tickets are on sale at presale prices for the last time tonight from 9-10:30pm in the Breezeway. #bethere &lt;3
If I survive hell week and the show, I will buy every person at Marist a giraffe. #hellweek #everydayimstruggling
@EmmaRose10 ahahah LOVE IT &lt;3 So much sass. You worked it today.
@brievos Literally my life today. hahaha &lt;3
Successful registration last week and now successful housing selection? Pretty sure I'm in the minority at #Marist nowadays.
@jmbrophy Send me on my wayyyyyyyyyy &lt;3 :)
@chaas991 &lt;3 Thanks, love! Can't wait to perform tonight. :)
Feeling like I don't have many people to rely on lately. At least I have myself. And dance.
@haileykiss Hi! I was one of the dancers. :) I'm really involved in the dance ensemble, but the theater program is great too!
Did anyone get any pictures from the #maristopenhouse flash mob? I am writing an article and desperately need one!
@haileykiss Hi! :) Did you get any pictures of the flash mob by any chance? I was in it/am writing an article about it!
@rkbmagnuson Did you happen to get any pics? I'm writing an article about the flash mob. :)
That just happened. #maristopenhouse &lt;3
#Maristopenhouse Get pumped!
@gingeeharrison @AnnieFrenz @BonnieSloo @ktweet23 @lschultz20 @sammmmmm3 Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! I'll be back around 7!
@cola_mia I already told you in class, but that one. WOO. :)
@cola_mia GAH. haha Which capping did you end up in?
Tickets for @MaristDance Dance Your Story show tickets on sale from 4-8pm in the Breezeway tonight for presale prices! :)
@ktweet23 @sammmmmm3 BUT WE'RE HERE NOW
I'm not ready to register for my fall semester of my senior year in the morning. #notokay #ilovecollege
@hill_roseanne11 Hartford Performs. :) Gotta get a part time job now, though. hahaha
Even though the internship I was almost offered fell through because of the company's budget, I got another internship I'm going to love. :)
One Direction- "One Thing" = today's The Wonders (Oneders?)- "That Thing You Do." #lackoforiginality #whyisthatonekiddressedlikeronburgundy
I had a great few days at home. Now to prepare for the onslaught of work, stress, and dance that is to come in the next few weeks.
@steve_sabato Second that. A lot. haha
@sammmmmm3 @ktweet23 @AnnieFrenz And honey boo boo child all in one night? Oh man.
@MaristDance @danielledeZao @acesa5 @TLCrichton Taylor is the master of photoshop. She is the best to shadow. :) Glad you like the posters!!
MCDE: Club of the year! :) Love @MaristDance. So happy to be a part of the ensemble and board!
Some of the friends I made abroad through #Bus2Alps have been a great help in writing my current article. Missing Europe and you guys!
@BMACtastic @Tacori I analyzed the same ad in my research methods class sophomore year. Interesting stuff!

Sometimes all I want to do is kick Ethics in the face. #unethical
@klerner Sometimes I wonder how journalists even come up with these words and phrases.
They're making Anchorman 2? Best day ever.
@nicole_fillion  I know, Nikki. I miss playing clarinet. :-/
@TheOfficeReport Hope not! The show is still just as funny, just in a different way, since Michael left. Hopefully they can keep it up!
I have to say, the Hunger Games was an amazing adaptation of the book, despite those slight differences. #teamrue #marryingpeeta
Busiest Friday ever. At least I get to see #TheHungerGames later. I like how it's a series so many people can enjoy and not fight over (ha)
I'm starting to get frustrated that I'm putting so much of my effort and heart into so much, and so little of it is paying off.
@TPorembova Aw, no worries! Just don't want to say I got it until they can officially offer it to me. :) Thanks so much for the support!
@TPorembova Thank you! I don't want to jinx it. I'll announce it once it is official (assuming the budget goes through) :)
Found out I'm the top candidate for the internship I interviewed for as long as their budget goes through! #fingerscrossed
@lindsayraex3 #Quinntervention
Lilly &amp; Marshall are literally my boyfriend and I. Pretty sure I've said the exact same things she did in this week's episode. #himym #love
Find me on LinkedIn. :) #li
Oreos and peanut butter. #parenttrap
Also, I wish there were more whales on #frozenplanet.
Playing the waiting game and getting tons of work done this week. Where did spring break go?
So good to know there are still some rational people out there. #cantwealljustgetalong
@toddwcostello Nah, I know. It's just everyone in general today. I'm just tired of hearing about it. lol
@meganxmaria Thanks, dude. Nothing upsets me more than people trying to put one another down.
@toddwcostello No one gave two shits about this until today. How about everyone just stops trying to make the other side feel inferior.
Invisible Children has been around for years. So what if people are just hearing about it now? Everyone has their own opinions. Be civil.
I think the phone interview for an internship I'm dying to get went really well. Here's to hoping for an in-person interview!
@TLCrichton bahaha certain people on my Facebook were trying to make anyone supporting IC feel inferior, but generally, no, I agree. :)
I'm so sick of hipsters going against everything, including good causes just because they're widespread. Educate yourselves.
@KelseyKeegan1 Glad you appreciate it! haha Just because they've all become popular series & movies doesn't mean anything lol
Congrats to the MAAC champs! #marist #redfoxnation
I don't get why people constantly compare Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Hunger Games. Not even remotely similar. #stoptryingtobehipsters
I have a few interviews in the coming weeks for internships in my field. Fingers crossed!
You post your resume looking for internships, and all you get are insurance scams. #dontdoit
Find me on LinkedIn! #in I'm a PR/Journalism major with a global studies minor looking for an internship!
@PPhillipsIdol Best guy on idol by far. :) If you don't make it, I'm boycotting.
Kind of in love with Phillip Phillips. Don't worry about it. #americanidol
@BMACtastic Aw thanks! :) I'm so excited. I had 40 people sign up. I usually have 10. hahaha This one's gonna be big!
@BMACtastic Yeah! :) I'm doing a mix of "Show Me How You Burlesque" and "Express!"
There are few things funnier than seeing people legitimately get upset over people "misusing memes" on the Marist Memes page. #matters
Let us begin another week of dancing, running around campus psychotically, and ridiculous amounts of work. #collegegrind
2 hours until teaching my first tap class since I went abroad. My dancers better #showmehowyouburlesque.
4th quarter in Fulton 15A is OREO TRUFFLE TIME. #EverydayImTrufflin
May or may not have played "Like a Prayer" in handbell choir last year. #notembarrassed
@CocaCola Superb planking form #gamedaypolarbears penguin.
But @AnnieFrenz does make a mean ziti.
#Ihavenoideawhatisgoingon
@CocaCola I don't understand football, but I do understand Arctic creatures. Loving the #gamedaypolarbears ...and all the snacks.
Here's another big who gives a shit to the Super Bowl. Oh well. At least there are snacks. #priorities
@DomMazzetti @bus2alps I went on Northern Loop and Amalfi Coast last semester. Wayyyy to choose the wrong semester to go. haha Have fun!
Hey, @MaristDance tappers. Hope to see your emails in my inbox at 5. Looking forward to meeting some new tappers. :)
@jasonneeson When you read it on Facebook, it just seems like they solely want to show the internet how smart and right they are.
Here's a big who gives a shit to everyone discussing politics on facebook.
@DDougyy hahahah thanksssss :)
Can't wait for dance to start. I'm so anxious for sign ups tomorrow! Choreographing again. Tappers, let's get our burlesque on. :)

Hey, guys! Can you take this survey for me for Public Opinion class? It's completely voluntary! Thanks so much! :) 
#Marist is truly a family. Rest in peace, Eva, Kerry, and Kevin. Even those who didn't know you miss you deeply.
#PrayforMarist &lt;3
Can't wait for the new episode of Once Upon a Time tonight. It's been too long. But if Graham is actually dead...I can't even. #heartbreak
@RyanGlander The first was definitely the best, but the story gets really interesting still! You'll love them!
Obsessed with The Hunger Games trilogy. Reading the last few pages of the final book on my Kindle. I don't want the books to end. :(
@kaileeeeeeee #loaf

Merry Christmas everyone! :) Been back from Italy for a week, and one of my greatest gifts has been seeing everyone again! #homesweethome
Been home from Italy for a few days. I missed America. But now I miss Italy. But America has more food. #americafuckyeah

One more final and only two days left in #Florence? Where did the time go? #dontwanttosaygoodbye

200 followers. What fun :)
@GinaRoseSirico Thanks so much for the retweet! :) Glad everyone's been finding it helpful! You're going to have an amazing time!
@courtttttt Thanks, girl! :) Hope your semester has been great. I'll see you soon, and I'm so happy you're going abroad! You'll love it!
Here's a post with advice I'd like to pass on to other study abroad students. :)

1 week left in Florence, Italy. The past 3 months have been amazing, difficult, and certainly memorable. I wouldn't change it for the world.

Can't believe I saw @FleurDeForce today in Firenze. :) What are the chances? Too bad I was too scared to say hi.
@abbeyscalia1 @MaristDance Thanks so much, Abbey. :) Hopefully I see you when I get back!!
Thank you to everyone who helped me become PR Manager for MCDE 2012-2013. :) I appreciate all your votes and support. &lt;3
New blog post! :) 
@nicole_fillion Seriously. Even though I can't wait to go home, it's going to be SO WEIRD.
@linak223 Oh sweet! :) I was hoping I could get them in senior year! I didn't see them when I signed up this semester!
@linak223 Hey, Lina! :) I'm working on mine too! When do they usually offer the global studies 3 credit course/1 credit seminar?
Also, I can't believe I have only 2 weeks left here in Florence. I've had the best time. There's still so much I want to see in Europe!
Hey, @MaristDance and all the lovely dancers! I'm running for PR! Please give me my last chance to be on the E-board before I graduate. :)
My first blog post about my travels in awhile. Enjoy! 3.5 weeks left in Firenze. :( 
I had an amazing week with my boyfriend and friends who braved some serious flight issues to see me in Florence. 1.5 months left!


Enjoy the third installment of my Northern Loop blogging extravaganza about my 10 day trip
My boyfriend's flight got delayed by who knows how long because of the stupid CT weather. #longdistancesucks
I just returned from the most amazing 10 day tour around Northern Europe. Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Paris in a week and a half? #pro
About to take on my 4th midterm. Bring it.
Isn't it funny how the people you love the most screw you over the most? Oh and fun fact, it hurts even more when you're an ocean away.
About to get on that midterm grind. Forgot I'm actually STUDYING abroad.
Can't believe I'm already planning for the 2nd half of junior year and am almost halfway done with my semester abroad. #gettingold

I had no idea it was #ChocolateWeek. Guess I'll be celebrating the right way by going to the Eurochocolate Festival in Perugia on Friday. :)
I was asked to start publishing my blog on a local town news website back in CT. Yay. :)
@linak223 hahaha Feel free! :) I have some stories from that trip. Got caught on top of Mt. Solaro/in the chairlift during a thunderstorm!
Just got back from the Amalfi Coast, and it was amazing. #worldtraveler
@AliTager Hey, it's great! :) Very busy but beautiful. I caved and got a Twitter before I Ieft. haha
So much unnecessary Italian homework. Too bad I'm never going to use it once I leave. It's okay. I still love you, Italy.

Amazing trip to Como/Bellagio, Italy and St. Moritz, Switzerland this weekend. Look out for a blog post soon! :)
What if you could move the needle to a more forgiving song? #peopleandthings #love
Snapped the strap on my across the shoulder bag. I am literally breaking everything the past couple of days.
@jacksmannequin I can't even describe my love for this song. And everything I've heard so far. It's been getting me through a lot. &lt;3
I was having a really hard time today, and then I heard "Television." Jack's Mannequin's #peopleandthings is making everything okay.
Broke the one good pair of headphones I brought to Italy. #excellent
@nicole_fillion GAH. That's the one weekend that's bad for me. Marc and his friends will be there that weekend! Later in November maybe? :)
Really want this cold to go away. I'll be traveling every weekend soon, and I can't afford to cancel trips and not get refunds. :(

Just made the best sandwich with zucchini and peppers from the central market in Florence. I'm getting so creative with my cooking.
I could eat dried mango for the rest of my life. #florencecentralmarket
I wish there was a way to watch the new #SVU 13th season premiere. :( Italy needs to get some live feed going up in here.
Those who are freaking out about the FB changes vs. those who are pretending to not freak out. Who will come out on top? #hipsters #WWE
Anthony Jesselnik just won my heart with an SVU joke. Favorite show. #sheenroast
Mike Tyson is crazier than Charlie Sheen but funnier than the entire deus. Loving this roast from Italy! #sheenroast
@CTGrlProblem I personally still love Mystic Aquarium. #ctgirllackofproblems
It's still like 85-90 on average in Florence. I miss fall! I do love it here, but it's so sad hearing about the weather back in New England.
I usually post my travel blog every 5 days, but this weekend needed its own. So much exploring. :) Enjoy! 
@michaelrudden Nahh, but it's ridiculous trying to budget here.
Florence is way too expensive.
Cannoli take 2: not as good as the first but still delicious.
New blog post on my travel blog-- Going with the Flo. Enjoy! 
@AndyMcMahonBot The name Amy is used in songs all the time. I think Alyssa deserves a shout out!
Just had a cannoli from a shop down my street. Literally dying. So. good. #sounnecessary #sodelicious
Just made a burger in Italy. #america

My roommate here in Florence & I have decided we miss American television and candy. #theimportantthingsinlife
Yay! My town is average! 
Saw a post on FB about choreographer auditions for @MaristDance. So sad! But good luck, everyone. :)
Tonight at 6 marks the beginning of my classes here in Italy! Topics in Nutrition: Italian Style Cooking tonight!
New blog post about my weekend trip and experiences here thus far. Enjoy! 
Look for a new blog post coming up after my first weekend traveling around Italy to the Alps, Trento, Sermione/Garda Lake, and Verona! :)
Kinda have to wake up at 5am, and it's 12:20am here. This is going to end well. #insomniac #jetlag
My travel blog! Check it out. :) 
Florence is definitely getting easier to adjust to. Trip to Verona & the Alps this weekend! #worldtraveler
In Florence! However, I have no hair product or appliances, have no idea where to buy groceries or any of the above, and am a mess. #lost
I can't sleep. I'm too nervous. I'm too excited.  #needsleepingpills
@michaelrudden Thanks for the helpful advice. I'll be on full alert! Have a great semester!
@nicole_fillion I will definitely let you know how the flight goes! Hopefully I'll get used to it quickly and get pictures up!
@steve_sabato Thank you! :) I will hopefully see you when I get back. Keep in touch!
@jasonneeson Please. I'll cavity search them harder.
Getting ready for the time of my life. #Italy #scaredshitless
@steve_sabato hahaha Favorite saying ever. Thanks for thinking of me! Have a great semester! :)
@sunshinesid3 Aw! I think I heard Sun. morning cancellations are going to start! I'm just worried the aftermath will mess mine up!
Hearing about everyone going back to #Marist while I'm still waiting to see how the hurricane affects my flight Tues. is killing me!
If Hurricane Irene screws up my last weekend home before I leave for Italy, I will be very upset. I have a boyfriend to say goodbye to. :(
@MaristPRSSA Hi! I'm going abroad this semester, but I really would like to join in the spring when I get back. How do I go about that?
@MelissaGallag Oh nice! Yeah, I'm a junior, obviously. :) Hopefully I run into you when I get back!
@MelissaGallag Hahah that made me feel so much better! I just have a few things left to do. I can't wait. :) What year are you at Marist?
@MelissaGallag Yes! :) Florence for the semester! I'm so excited, but the packing is causing me to be a little neurotic. hahaha
Less than a week until lift off. #freakingout
The earthquake made it to CT. Well. That was fun.
Most parents would be proud of their kid for going to a good school, getting a 4.0., and studying abroad. Mine resent it. I hate money.
@sunshinesid3 Gah. It really is so stressful! I'm taking an extra bag, which is probably a bad idea but oh well. I leave the 30th! 1 week!
Spending this entire week doing last minute errands and packing for my semester abroad. So stressful, but I hope it will be worth it.
No matter how old I get, I will always love Mystic Aquarium. #lovebelugawhales
Finished work for the summer! Using this next week to prepare for Italy like it's my job. #hatepacking #whocaresaboutkimkardashianswedding
Did anyone else get sick of "Pumped Up Kicks" the second they heard it months ago and want to punch the hipsters who sing it for no reason?
Just finished Sisterhood Everlasting and loved it. It was the perfect end to the books even though the majority of it was heartbreaking.
I was kind of slow at checking out the new Dangerous Summer album, but I love it.  The same great music with a more mature sound. #missedit
None of the classes at the gym are appealing today, so I think I'll just have my own and do some tap improv. Ah. I miss dance.
Found out my housing for Florence! It's all starting to seem real. Can't wait to start studying PR over there!
@michaelrudden Unfortunately, I came pretty close. haha
If I had a nemesis, it would be super glue. #evil
Yeah, I actually contributed to a ridiculous trending topic. #notevenembarrassed
Bacon for Elephants #replacemovienameswithbacon
Bacon's the Man #replacemovienameswithbacon
Crazy, Stupid Bacon #replacemovienameswithbacon
I will never not be obsessed with Reeses, but the PB Snickers that I got on sale today truly impressed me. #peanubutterandchocolate #love
If whatever is wrong with me keeps me from what I've worked and prepared so hard for this semester...ugh.
@RubinaAKhan hahaha Genius.
@linak223 Ah perfect! Thank you! :) I got cute luggage tags while I was in Maine, but I still need to get all the boring stuff. :-p
Loving The Help so far. It's an amazing book, but I must say I'm so happy I did not exist in those times of ignorance.
@Meredoodlexo I loved that movie!
@ststacy Hey! :) Miss you! But yeah, I want to get locks for my luggage, but they have to be TSA approved. P.s. when's your flight?!
Preparing a shopping list to get a few key items to bring abroad. Does anyone know where to get TSA approved luggage locks by any chance?
@jasonneeson It's cool. We had ice cream.
Going to Tanglewood is an experience everyone needs to have. Great time at the Train concert!
@zakariah My last one was lacking a forehead. It's cool. lol
The way Twitter crops profile pictures is so awkward.
I love relaxing weekends with my love. We saw Crazy, Stupid Love, went out to dinner, and then just relaxed today.  #missingyoualready
My mom just yelled at for telling my friends I'm going abroad. Pretty sure psychos could find me a lot more easily here. #paranoid #moms
@IndelibleINTL Thanks so much! That's really helpful!
Spent the morning going to doctor's appointments, the gym, and running errands to prepare for abroad. Can it be tomorrow? #seeingmylove
My car is getting old and creaky. I'm depressed. #tooattached #stayingalive
Just read an article about body-switching movies that mentioned the movie Freaky Friday. Now I really want to watch it.
Ah, another half day of work. #naptime #shoppingtime
I am missing my MCDE tappers like crazy. Going abroad will be amazing, but if I'm missing it this much already, oh boy. #tapdance #whatilove
I enjoy #SharkWeek, but I'd like to see more about the sharks themselves...not so much the attacks on humans.
I've decided I'm really excited that I'm getting into my real PR classes while I'm in Italy. I also really want that global studies minor.
Got tickets to see Wicked at the Bushnell with Marc 2 days before I leave for Italy. So excited!
Hopefully getting everything figured out.
@The_Future_isME Smoooooooooooth.
100 followers. Woooooo.
I'm taking names when it comes to preparing to go abroad so far. However, I still need packing tips! Those who got to #studyabroad? Advice?
Bernadette Peters and Bob Saget in an SVU rerun? Never thought I'd see the day!
@NTMakeupArt Awesome! I'm glad to hear it. I've heard nothing but good things, so I'm hoping it was a good nvestment. :)
I think plans falling through is what upsets me the most, especially when they're with someone I really wanted to see. #heartbreak #asusual
Everything being up in the air is killing me.
Ordered my first BHCosmetics eyeshadow palette on sale so I don't have to pack a ton of makeup when I go to Italy. So excited. :)
My nose piercing fell out for the first time today. That shit is complicated to get back in. #ouch
Just realized the book I'm reading is the third in a loosely tied series. No wonder some of it was confusing. #oops
May be leaving Maine a day early because of the crappy weather. I'm kinda sad, but it will be nice to be home. #homesweethome #stupidweather
I got a multi-colored floral lobster that I'm going to take pictures of everywhere I travel in Europe. #travelinglobster #studyabroad
Really? Who needs a nearly $8,000 vase? KIM KARDASHIAN, WHY ARE YOU FAMOUS?  
Love not being able to get a doctor's appointment when I actually need one.
@JerryGriparich @sn00ki Now you two would most definitely be the cutest couple ever.
Brown's Old Fashioned Ice Cream in York Beach, Maine needs to be on #DinersDriveinsandDives asap. Their cookie dough is unmatched.
There's a mouse in the basement at the beach house. #sweet #needamousetrap
@Marist Love the picture of the Hancock Center! Looks great!
Having an amazing time in #YorkBeach. Just went to Bob's Clam Hut, which was on #DinersDriveInsandDives!
@Meredoodlexo I'll be in Maine for the week starting tomorrow &lt;3 #favoriteplace #childhoodmemories
The fact that #itsalwaystheuglypeople is trending is messed up.
That awkward moment when your dad tries to make a joke about your sex life.
Getting my tap dancin' on.
Trips to the Amalfi Coast and Northern Loop (Berlin, Prague, Amsterdam, Paris)=booked.
Oh and whaddup, 100th Tweet? Not that it's special or anything. I just felt weird leaving it at 99.
Just over a month until my semester in Florence!
Spending the week babysitting/going to the gym/packing/anticipating. Spending a few relaxing days w/ someone special will be #worththewait.
I'm so tired of being apart from him.
My mom is having her sister and my friend's mom over and is cleaning frantically like they're actually going to give a shit.
There are cows on the loose in my neighborhood. #obviously #mytown
LOVE flat tires in the 95 degree heat with the kids I babysit in tow. I handled it, but it was not an easy ask.
Just saw Phineas & Ferb is trending. Is it sad that when I watch it with the kids I babysit that I'm the one who's laughing?
So excited to hit up the beach with Hillary and Ally tomorrow! A trip like this is definitely needed.
Okay, rain. Just attack as soon as I leave the house. #stupidweather
Definitely addicted to the new mango pineapple smoothies at McDonald's. It's fine.
@abbeyscalia1 I don't watch it consistently, but I did see that one too! They have amazing chemistry!
@abbeyscalia1 I can't get enough of their routine for "I Got You." I'm considering doing a lyrical/tap fusion to that song eventually!
Also, I just tap danced my ass off in the basement. I miss it way too much. #itsbeentoolong
Pray the weather doesn't suck for the Yankee game I'll be at tomorrow!
Watching Going the Distance reiterated how much being long distance sucks, but eh. Worth it.
@nicole_fillion That we are. :)
Happy 4th of July! I'm doing nothing exciting, but I now have a bit of a tan going. #reallypale
Spending the day with someone special. Hopefully the sun comes out. I was feeling a pool day. #stupidweather
Booooo. Clothing under $50=no longer exempt from taxes. That's all I ever buy. #heartbreak
Kloter Farms, where my dad works, was engulfed in flames today. One of Ellington's few landmarks is gone for now, but they'll rebuild!
Hitting up my favorite #Zumba class.
@kelliehayden hahahaha I died. Oral surgeons too. Anyone who really has anything to do with dentistry overall.
Getting ready for another week with the crazy children.
Oh, today. You suck.
@steve_sabato I liked parts of it, but it's also kind of messed up. haha
@zakariah Aw man. :( Me too. I wanted to see that, but I watched the premiere of Wilfred instead. I did not enjoy it much. haha
9 hours of watching children complete. However, my gym time that was planned is now incomplete.
I've realized recently that when it comes to books and movies, the only thing that makes me cry is when a dog dies. So heart-wrenching.
@MaristLStrumpf Aw, thanks! I'll miss you all too. :) I'll definitely come to you with questions. It's great to know I can go to somebody!
@MaristLStrumpf  You are more than welcome to join me in the fall in Florence. I need lots of advice! haha
@shaunjennings It was a tie. Each excelled in different events. Kind of a lame ending, in my opinion.
Just read a book called Shark vs. Train to the kid I babysit. Logical concept.
@kaileeeeeeee Aw, well hopefully we can hang out soon. :) And agreed. My main focus is saving up for Florence and my visit to Londontown. :)
@kaileeeeeeee Thank youuu! &lt;3 It's been taking quite a long time, but a lot of things are getting better. Let me know how you're doing!
It's always an amazing feeling when things finally start coming together and making sense again.
Waste of a four hour drive*
Okay cool. Nevermind. Thanks to traffic we will now miss the concert and our friends will be stuck with two extra tickets. Waste of a fo ...
Hitting up a Dispatch concert in NJ on a whim. Driving there, however, blowsssss.
@amybruni Hanson, Reeses' PB cups, and unnecessary amounts of clothes and jewelry. :) #guiltypleasures
I need to stop shopping with money I don't have. Nobody let me go anywhere where things can be purchased until after Italy.
@nicole_fillion Favorite past time. &lt;3
Unintentional girls' night. All my guy friends bailed...oh well. More food for us!
The kids I babysit have a bounce house in the basement. Really? Where was this in my childhood?
I despise shopping for shorts and usually just resort to wearing pants all summer...BUT I FOUND A PAIR TODAY THAT DOESN'T LOOK HORRIBLE. :)
I now have 69 followers. Heh.
Apparently, today was drive like a douchebag day. Must have missed the memo.
#imhappiestwhen I am tap dancing. :)
You have to love the old men who show up to Zumba and are surprisingly good at it.
No, GPS. Thank you so much. I really wanted to get home in 3 hours instead of an hour and a half.
I'm usually not really into Lady Gaga, but I must say that "Edge of Glory" makes a FANTASTIC summer driving song.
@beingryanjude Since approximately a week or two ago. :) haha
@nicole_fillion @jasonneeson It's like our high school music went out on a date!
This #thunderstorm is insane. It took me an hour to get home from Manchester. It's normally a 20 minute drive max.
@ThePeoplesPress Let me know if you need anymore articles, by the way. I'd love to help out when I can.
@ThePeoplesPress Ah! thank you so much! :)
Let's play How Many Times Will People Quote the Same Exact Line from "First Time" by The Script on Facebook? It's a new game I made up.
@MaristDance hahaha I will indeed. :)
#10Confessions: Nearly all of my relationships are currently falling apart, and I have no idea how it all managed to happen at once.
@TapDancingNews I think I'm going to miss it. :( Be sure to post videos!
Law & Order: SVU is sponsored by Judy Moody & the Not Bummer Summer. Sexual crimes? Children's movies? Okay. Totally get it.
@MaristDance I'm so depressed I won't be able to dance because I'll be abroad next semester. I would find the perfect song for tap. :(
@jasonneeson Those were the days.
I figure out the plot twists in books too early way too often. Boooo.
I love how when I walk around with the 5 year old I babysit, people try to gauge whether I'm the way too young mom, sister, or sitter.
@zakariah To each their own. You like sports, and I like shows about polygamists. Nbd.
I tried to watch the Sister Wives final special for the season, but figures, TLC was freaking out and freezing every 5 seconds. Heartbreak.
Though I hated not having my car up at #Marist, I can certainly say I did not miss having to pay for gas. I am once again cursed.
@michaelrudden I am not in denial of that in the least bit.
I just finished Water for Elephants and absolutely loved it. Now I'm dying to see the movie. Figures, it's probably out of theaters soon. :(
I love seeing my friends from #Marist in my natural habitat, #CT.
@nicole_fillion I just read The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks and am in the middle of Water for Elephants after one day so I recommend both!
My mom is not letting me go to the gym because of the #tornadowarnings in #CT so I guess I'll have to watch Ghost Hunters all night. :)
@kaileeeeeeee I love how both of our recent posts have all been about babysitting. haha I'm just known as Miss Alyssa. So official.
@jasonneeson @nicole_fillion Doot da doot da doo doo doooooo, da doo doo-doo-doo. Doot da doot da dooo doo doo da doo da dooooo.
@kaileeeeeeee I'm right there with you, my dear.
I was just asked if I was a grandma yet by the kid I watch. Should I be offended or flattered that I appear so worldly and wise? :-p
Full-time babysitting starts tomorrow. I'm having trouble accepting that I'm now on a schedule. Boooo.
"Why did you stick an earring in your nose?" -the 7 year old I babysit. Hating on my new nose piercing. Whatevs.
You have to love watching children's movies with horrible acting while babysitting.
Babysitting for the evening. It's not the most glamorous job, but I will be making bank. It's fine.
Bonfire with @jasonneeson, @nicole_fillion, and others. Ohhh, #Connecticut. When will you become exciting?
@nicole_fillion I don't even want to talk about curbing my shopping habits. &lt;/3 haha
Free download of The Rocket Summer's live acoustic album! 
@ThePeoplesPress Where do I send the story when I am done?
@nytimes I couldn't agree more. There is way too much pressure. And hey, there are a lot of cute bathing suits with coverage.
#MyMarist will soon be in Italy, but this year, it was living in Gartland and having to trek all the way across campus to get anywhere. &lt;3
@ThePeoplesPress Great, thanks! I'll definitely look into it!
@kaileeeeeeee That last tweet pretty much sums up my problems. I feel you. haha
@kaileeeeeeee Right now my life is such a mess. I know exactly how you feel. &lt;3 Let me know if you need anything.
#everymanshouldknowhowto handle an argument and face the problem head on rather than retreating until the tension passes.
WebMD is the most terror-inducing website known to man.
@nicole_fillion  I'll be at Lorenzo de'Medici in Florence. :) You better come visit me. And spend the money we will be saving all summer.
Savoring my final days of freedom until work starts next week. I've gotta save all my money up for Florence in the fall. Worth it. :)
@kelliehayden No problem!  I'm new to Twitter and am finding people I know. :) Hope you had an amazing time in London!
@jasonneeson Shut up. This shit is confusing. And no that has nothing to do with my username. That's a song lyric. haha
@nicole_fillion I may do just that. P.s. I just got a Twitter. Hi. :)
I've never been too interested in getting a Twitter, but it will help with my major. So bring it. :)
