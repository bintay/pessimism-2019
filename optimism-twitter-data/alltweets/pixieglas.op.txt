@Dogwoof Poignant as the great Ray Davies (@TheSpiritof45 told story of mother dying in childbirth) passed away yesterday.
That's shame at work, they know it's wrong.

@SynthXndrHarris move to Glasgow! We've all been plotting it all night.

@C_before_C I think I heard earlier on that he demanded a recount.

@SynthXndrHarris it is so depressing.
@SynthXndrHarris we're utterly fucked. There will be a referendum on European Community by end of the year and same cunts will vote us out.
Ray Davies. On every protest, every march. Compassionate, passionate, an inspiration. Such a loss, so pleased to have known him. @CorCochion
My sadness at tonight's results compounded by the news that one of my heroes has passed. RIP Ray Davies @CorCochion

This is why #milifandom. Hard to root for arrogance and privilege when you're a generation fighting for education.  
@ItsHelenMartin I am actually considering wearing a shower cap this morning.
I think I'll keep with Ms but I like the idea of Mx, it sounds like a rap name. What about you @duffyc? 


@FACTmag @invadauk ooh, watched this again yesterday, so good. When are they being released and can I buy one via @spillersrecords ?
@needledesign Hey fella, just checked with Box Office and your vouchers are still there to be used! Come down and see us! x
@timlusher @zoesqwilliams once again, couldn't be bothered to go to Wales, Scotland or N Ireland. Not really "a trip around Britain" is it?

@needledesign ok. I'll check tomorrow when back in work. Should be fine!
I may have messed up the vegan lasagne. In unrelated news, I was a bit bank holiday drunk earlier.
@needledesign it should be, is it for tonight?
Am kind of at a loss at why people spend money on actual jewels if they don't already own every record ever made.
@CeriannKay Oh yes it is. Beer. Garlic sticks. Snooker. Bliss.
Might nickname @spillersrecords 'The Great Temptation' every time I go in I come out with jewels. 
@petepaphides vinyl beautiful too! Bought it from @spillersrecords
This would be so great!

@duffyc do you want to come and look at hot boys* in a gym with me at 5pm? 

*Steen, possibly Peebles.
@AnneModicum Yours too! Fancy coming to the surf rock music &amp; film event I'm doing next Sunday? If you can get to Cardiff I'll get you in.

Anyone else's screen going barmy with boredom and frustration at how shit everything is? #bbcqt
@CeriannKay same. Horrible.
Poor Ed. What a bunch of shitbags in the audience. If those nasty, selfish views represents Britain then I'm really fucking depressed.
Cripes, a really right wing audience. 'Benefits a lifestyle choice' 'bankers do good' Cameron didn't get this kind of criticism. #bbcqt
Um.. I don't want to live in a @HomesforBritain house. Ad looks a bit too much like Cabin In The Woods for comfort.

@hannahpyt @duffyc It's really scary, the idea that someone actively campaigning to remove women's shelters could get in. As bad as UKIP.
@hannahpyt @duffyc Last census showed number of Welsh speakers higher % in any other place in Wales in Cardiff West, possible correlation
This week's Fun Friday filmy thingy - Divine and John Waters as amigurumi. 
@hannahpyt @duffyc Really concerning that Plaid would have him, a controversial character in a high profile seat 
@hannahpyt @duffyc Everyone says it's a safe Labour seat but public opinion is turning to Plaid due to anti-austerity rhetoric.
@hannahpyt @duffyc "Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe." Also had name redacted from council meetings.
@hannahpyt @duffyc this 
@duffyc @___HannahAustin @Plaid_Cymru @LeanneWood nope, although I've been trolled by members for mentioning the issue. Really concerned.
Oh my my Eastern Washington gets a great gig! Best Moscow night since drag shows!  
@Luke_e_Boy This is my last tweet. I have read his record. I have read his statements. Nothing could ever make me want to vote for him.
In other news, Deutsche Bank fined …
@Luke_e_Boy Everything I read about him is slippery: read the Occupy blog, the council logs. I feel the party has us down. Disappointed.
@Luke_e_Boy I really disagree. Men's rights are absolutely not being threatened by women's shelters.
@Luke_e_Boy I was really excited about this election and now deeply embarrassed. If he gets in women's rights are threatened.
@Luke_e_Boy I think that I have the right to question their judgement of putting such a controversial character in a high profile seat.
@Luke_e_Boy I have voted Plaid in every election since 1998, I am so proud that Leanne has given them a national platform.
@Luke_e_Boy look, I respect your view and don't want to seem unreasonable but I think that we are going to have to agree to disagree.
@Luke_e_Boy happy to prove you wrong, although many people I know have and had toxic encounters. Careful how you accuse people of slander.
@Luke_e_Boy yet I am having to find another candidate because I dearly want to vote Plaid but cannot vote for the Cardiff West candidate.
@Luke_e_Boy That is exactly why I'm so disappointed. I've stood with @LeanneWood at rallies for women's rights and so proud of her success.
@ewanjonesmorris @IainPeebles @paulbarnett1 was it Fabric? Dalston Superstore?
@Luke_e_Boy You might want to think about picking on a truly privileged group to attack, not targeting women.
@duffyc @IainPeebles @joy_collective @leodominicwest @CarlRylatt @flowerofphong TRIP! It'll be like an ear-splitting remake of 'Grand Slam'.
@Luke_e_Boy the idea that men are an oppressed group is dangerous and offensive.
@Luke_e_Boy 'Not true'? Why is he targeting women's charities if he is not a misogynist? 
@Luke_e_Boy his targeting of women's charities has made me completely rethink my support for the party.
Oh Murdoch you horrible shit.  
@Luke_e_Boy he is a mens rights activist who wants to see the funding cut for women's shelters. Has said some ugly things about women.
@ewanjonesmorris @paulbarnett1 how were they dressed differently? Were their ties different? DETAILS!
@ewanjonesmorris @paulbarnett1 you and your London ways...
.@LeanneWood I've seen you active at rallies for women's rights. Why do you allow a candidate like Neil McEvoy to stand in Cardiff West?

Chatted to fellow cyclist &amp; complete stranger at stop lights about #cycling on a sunny day &amp; how we both had wine in our panniers.
Some lovely people are selling their house in a great part of #Cardiff. 
@NetflixUK are you doing it episode by episode or is it the whole second half of season 4?
Had a lovely day off. Cat cwtches, reading, record shopping @spillersrecords, new vegan treat shop &amp; chats with fellow cyclists in the sun.
@simonloverules lovely way to round up the heavy sweaters.
@JackieMorrisArt Oh do! Me and the fella have a few, never without a badge 
@JackieMorrisArt ooh how do we get hold of those beauties?!
@emma_daman @TenderPreyMusic the one who describes herself as pansexual and into Star Trek and politics sounds like me at 16.

@jonronson Oh great, just booked it!
End Violence Against Women. 
@SongWarmonger @chaptertweets @CardiffFilmFest Doh! Lots of great films at the festival tomorrow though.
Wonderful to see entire audience enthralled to the legendary John Boorman in Q&amp;A @chaptertweets @CardiffFilmFest 
The Hook Up is on in First Space (by the cinema corridor) until 6pm. 
@ceri22 have you looked at the accounts? Many charities make an income held in reserve, their funding is reliant on them not going bankrupt.
@ceri22 I hope Plaid win many seats across the country, so proud @LeanneWood However, I won't be voting for them here till McEvoy is removed
@ceri22 "blind hatred" is clearly a little exaggerated isn't it?! I have formed my opinion of my candidate through his shocking record.
@ceri22 Yep, which is exactly why I would like a Plaid candidate who doesn't hate and fear women and campaigns to destroy women's shelters.
@ceri22 I wish I could vote Plaid, I have done in the past and would do again if they selected a candidate who had reasonable ethics.
@ceri22 I see from your posts that you completely support McEvoy's laughable "men's rights" stance (like men are oppressed!).
Part one of worky catch up DONE! Lunch @CardiffFilmFest Hook Up and... a bit more work till John Boorman.
How to beat the sadness of a reporting deadline @WFMU LIZ BERG WE LOVE YOU! 
@spillersrecords @RSDUK Taking a gamble cos can't come in today but hoping @theResidents records still there tomorrow! Hope it's going ok!x
Everything about Deliverance encapsulated in one brilliant scene #JohnBoorman @CardiffFilmFest @chaptertweets later! 
The lovely @CardiffFilmFest have John Boorman coming to @chaptertweets tonight! I'm very excited! 
Happy #RSD15 to @spillersrecords @DiverseMusic @DerricksMusic for giving me somewhere to go to buy records since 1991.
@ceri22 I want to be so proud of Plaid, especially now @LeanneWood has been given a public forum but this is completely tainting the party.
@ceri22 I am incredibly disappointed in Plaid for taking on this career politician who flips all over the parties to ensure a job.
@ceri22 Also, you're basing the argument on someone very removed from the situation and a charity without money to go through the courts.
@ceri22 I know people with personal experience of McEvoy also he has made many 'men's rights' statements. As pro-woman as Farage.
Need to get up for busy day @CardiffFilmFest John Boorman visit later but currently have affectionate cat on me and don't want to move him.
Good luck to everyone participating in #RSD15 @spillersrecords @int_monologue  hope customers are all smiles. Xxx

@TwmBurum @PlaidWest It's old tip of the iceberg, many female members have complained.  Have written to Leanne. 
@TwmBurum @PlaidWest careful lovely, I usually vote Plaid but the candidate is a complete misogynist and total embarrassment.
"Progressive change is what this country needs." Yes please @NicolaSturgeon!
@gavin986 As for Putin, he is far too in thrall to capitalism, he needs to keep the oligarchs happy, he won't do owt.
@gavin986 I'm really not afraid of tinpot dictator Jong Il, their technology is it's a human rights matter more than anything else. 1/2
@gavin986 despite what Farage tells everyone, this isn't the cold war. I would like a really good reason why stronger diplomacy isn't key.
I'm confused about who exactly we would use Trident against. Terrorism is modern warfare, no-one is coming to invade us. #leadersdebate

Awoken to cat chasing madly around the room to alert us to The Fall playing on @BBC6Breakfast. I think he is dancing.

Many thanks to @duffyc for alerting me to an art movement I can believe in. Lookie @ctangle 
@duffyc @joy_collective coo! That is some smart work.

@cynghanedd missed this! Will have to watch on iplayer!
@JanineHJones didn't stop thinking about it till I was in my 20s, discovered queer culture / the internet for variations on female.
@JanineHJones I was like that at 10, had a serious chat with my mum (which must have freaked her out no end).
@TomosMonpot @SarahNicholas pah! Bloody Murdoch. Mid season break had me in bits.
Does anyone know when / how @MadMen_AMC is on in the UK?

@PeppermintP4TT1 @spillersrecords @dukeofburgundy yeah, really perfect. Wish you could have come to my Lavender Screen discussion!
Spent morning listening to @spillersrecords haul. @dukeofburgundy soundtrack @CarpenterMovies Lost Themes. Amazing nap followed.

My friend @Twowhitecranes had 2 excited kids asking her questions like a mini press conference cos they loved her sets solo &amp; @TRUST_FUND
Well @WalesGoesPop still holds the record for friendliest, most welcoming festival ever. Wish there were more all ages venues in Cardiff.
@FlatleyEmma this is the lovely lady who made my gorgeous bag @thepocketpirate
@spillersrecords @WNS_MUSIC ace! I am finally FINALLY coming for those records.
Now getting up, trying to find @lastbookshop Mike so we can eat and then defo dancing @WalesGoesPop #GoodSaturday
First full day off and I read an entire book (Gone Girl, bloody excellent) and saw ace bands. Easter is the best, thanks Ponitus Pilate.
Also, accidentally photo bombing @slumoflegs @thejelas upstairs bike party made me curiously bashful, like walking in on a 1970s rock orgy.
NB: @thejelas Aled's cheeky concentrating drum face with Colin &amp; Nat's alternating hip moves is one of my favourite things in life.
.@slumoflegs @cianuro @thejelas made me dance like a sound-activated plastic plant from the 80s. Diolch @RollfortheSoul @ConnectTheDots
The @RollfortheSoul not ruined by what was described to me as 'meat with eyes' smashing a window in bank hol-induced cuntiness.
Due to advance ticket confusion we are having one day in @RollfortheSoul at Wkndr. It has been grin-inducing great.

Bad-film-watching Avatar. Frankie in his favourite spot on top the Virgin box and I think we just lost a $5mill shot when he did a stretch.
One of the all time best days off: chatting with lovely @sacredpawsltd fantastic food @milgi with Emma, bumping into Sally &amp;  Mark, nap.
@ohpeas there is a ice cream place on Clare Road that will deliver cookie dough, cakes, puddings, sweets... Via Just Eat. Corrrr
Just found out there is an app will deliver puddings. Why with all this technology can we not have an app for finding specs after a nap?
What a fantastic @joy_collective night. Thanks to everyone who danced and played. @sacredpawsltd Another Neville and Bellies.
Unexpected career move. 
We love @sacredpawsltd with our hips &amp; itchy feet! Thanks for a great @joy_collective night @UndertoneCF everyone! 
Ahhhhh Another Neville! Twisty fun! Watching Colin dance = like Nureyev in his prime. @UndertoneCF @joy_collective

I was such a weird teenager. Pictures of Angela Carter, David Lynch, Almodovar and Paul Heaton on my wall. Set up zine against Take That.
After something like 25 years I still adore Heato, if only pop these days was that political. @PaulHeatonSolo
"To the burning of the Stock Exchange and bombing of the press (I think the answer's yes)." Also calls out U2 for being establishment tools.

How can risks be taken by artists if the money comes with private sector caveat that no-one can be offended? #killculture
Culture is multi-faceted and this should be reflected in the public funding for the arts. #killculture
No public money helping out small venues &amp; labels means no money into artists, venues charging more. Horizons shrink #killculture
As @joy_collective we put on DIY gigs (own money, unsigned / experimental artists). Austerity makes this unsustainable #killculture
Tory austerity budget does not work, we need investment to make our future sustainable.  A generational gulf is being created. #killculture
Interested in how austerity has impacted on the arts? I AM! @WNOtweet is leading the debate with David Pountney look out for #killculture

I foresee with my third eye that the @joy_collective gig tomorrow @EncorCDF  with @flowerofphong will be mystically majestic! Please come!
@sara_huws questions pop in my head all the time. I'm fascinated. I loved Bedwetter, read it in one sitting.

@JanineHJones was ill for Xmas parties, fine when no-one was doing fun things &amp; got ill again when dry Jan finished. Impecable timing.
