@arjunidiot I am too. I know the trailers are misleading.
@arjunidiot Pata hai bhai. Read the tweet again. Never compared the two.
Why is Suhel ZNMD Seth talking so much sense today? What day is it? Oh wait, it's Monday, right?
@mihirfadnavis is there an embargo?
That said, I am still optimistic and hopeful about BV. The hope is faint, but it is there.
I read this review of SAAWARIYA which said something like: if the only thing of merit in your film is the set design, you should be worried.
@drdang KRK review. I just wanted to check how bad the guy was.
@drdang my bad. anything but a review. i decided to check this guy out. boy, what a cunt. you saw?
"Budhaape ke umar mein khada hona bandh ho jaata hai..", actual line spoken by an asshole in a Piku review. Worse lines follow.
"Bhaiya..."

The last film I enjoyed with AB in it was KHAKEE. So, here I am, more than 11 years later, walking about, with nothing but Piku on my mind.
@invokeanand I don't think you remember but I hated the trailer as much as you did :-) don't want to hype it up. dekh ke bolna kaisi lagi.
@invokeanand Piku dekhi?
@rmanish1 maine turn off kiya hua hai :P
@rmanish1 ahahaha, par dil garden garden ho gaya film dekhke. personally shukriya ada karne ka mann kiya :-)
@ShoojitSircar sincerest thanks, i meant :-)
@rmanish1 ji samjha nahin?
@irrfan_k sir, mera pranaam sweekar karein. there's absolutely nothing that you can't do. masterclass in acting. #piku
Dear @ShoojitSircar, please accept my sincer-est for the absolute cracker of a film that you've made. #Piku
@silverlightgal @anuragspks Ah, no ma'am, just saw it. Mighty nice.
@m_saik @ITwalaBoy arre no no. parody account.
@drdang the hindi translation of this, and i am speaking the truth, is: main ghanton ek kali ka ras pee sakta hun.
Aa gaye? Barso ab.

@Appy_Fizzz It's kinda hard  to explain. I still love Shaktimaan. Doesn't mean it's any good or holds up today.
@Appy_Fizzz I clapped maniacally today in the theater after watching the ep 7 trailer.
@Appy_Fizzz It has that effect if you've seen it as a kid. I saw them quite late &amp; even I'm a fan, waiting eagerly for ep 7. Hated ep1, btw.
Happy birthday fellow Nolan paagal @ReelReptile. You were born to write and make films. Many happy returns :-)
Rest in peace, Richard Corliss.
@SarikaGangwal yuss. magic hour. i am at Bangalore :-)
@stwta @abnvx oh damn I missed that tweet. aur ye soch raha tha ki AB ji kahan tag hue is conv mein. #facepalm
@stwta @abnvx haan par ye 'being rich' waala angle aaya kahan se? the nation wants to know.
@stwta @abnvx haiiiin?
@stwta Waah!
@stwta aap itni jaldi uth gaye? ya roz 6 baje tak uth jaate ho?
@stwta Aur ac se mujhe ghutan hoti hai
@stwta kaise bataun. fan ki aadat si pad gayi hai. hawa na lage sahi hai par pankhe ka sound zarur sunai dena chahiye ;-)
@stwta sahi. main soya hi nahin raat bhar. kambakht bijlee chali gayi thi.

@ShiladityaBora That's so good to hear. Mani Ratnam is a master. But has it released w/ eng subs in Bombay only? Bangalore or elsewhere?
@Namrata_Joshi it was indeed :-)
Searching made easier by tapping on the Twitter search button (android) only once? Gah. Let's make it twice. #fail

Happiest birthday wishes @bolnabey, mere fellow filmi keedey. An bol diya toh mat bolna ki bolta hai. Many happy returns.
john williams cascaded through my ears, my mind
I was …
Congrats @nagrathnam.
Congratulations @varungrover. You are unstoppable.
@ghaywan Neeraj, hugest congratulations. So, so, so proud of you. Remember what I told you ? I will see your film FDFS in theater.
Problem with ZNMD? Maybe. But people who after seeing the film went, "Apni friendship prove karne ke liye road trip pe chalte hain." 

Jeez.
I saw an RT by somebody called Kamal Mehra on my TL. I was like what the, when the? Turns out, it is Anil Kapoor.

@SandeepLoyalka For me, OLLO &gt; KKG &gt; SHANGHAI = STAR &gt; DBB  &gt; LSD
@drdang dude, same feels. also both deserve sequels. but considering we aren't in an ideal world... sigh.
I dug #DetectiveByomkeshBakshy. May not be DB's best but terrible? Fuck off. Will watch again. And again.
People on my TL have already decided that DBB is a bad film. Pehle dekh toh lo.
@bolnabey @varungrover @drdang here
@hedonist_redux yes. obligation ;-)
@psemophile feels great to hold in hands. sturdy. coloring and art looks great. yet to pop in the disc tho.
@psemophile yes :-)
Alright, alright, alright. 
@silverlightgal @AcidMess sorry. not a sports person at all.
@rmanish1 @bolnabey @IbuHatela agree. along with RK in AAMIR.

@drdang Haha. Back here? Long term?
@lazygarfield laya, just read your article on indiewire. very nicely written. things have become worse here. and that's putting it mildly.

@NotSoSnob read the comments in @invokeanand's post.
@DoctorRadiohead thanks dude. Will see a doc. Thanks again :-)

@direstraits_ haha. no shifts, sir. did you get your BB bluray set?
@AbhinavBhatt01 acha. maine sri devi bakery ke upar waale gym mein join kiya tha. ek mahina poora kasrat kiya, phir chhod diya :-(
@AbhinavBhatt01 sahi. kaun se gym mein jaa rahe ho? BTM ya office?
@rk_pradeep cool. all the best, bro. and massive congratulations!
@bolnabey sigh..
@AbhinavBhatt01 thanks AB. gymming phir se shuru karne ki soch raha hun
@slayer0929 thanks man, will do :-)
@rk_pradeep thanks Pradeep. will do. when are you leaving?
@arjunidiot thanks for asking mate :-)
@arjunidiot no sleeping pills. that will be like recovering from something and getting addicted to something else. will go see a doc soon.
@arjunidiot no arjun. i haven't. this has been a regular problem but i dunno, this time it's kinda.. severe.
Earlier I managed to sleep for at least 4 hours continuously. Deprived of even that now. And it isn't like I am not trying.
15th consecutive day. No sleep. Sleeping irregularly. For 2-2.5 hours in the whole day. Don't feel tired/weak/sleepy. Something's wrong.
@invokeanand so uninteresting this one was.
I love Rishi Kapoor as an actor and everything but never knew he was this cool. His tweets are hilarious. In a good way, of course.
@silverlightgal @stwta @Namrata_Joshi no tamatar. completely dry. only onions, potatoes and green chillies.
@silverlightgal @stwta @Namrata_Joshi waaaah! looks solid ekdum. i had this in the evening: maggi. 
Happy birthday @rmanish1. Dher saara pyaar aur shubhkaamnayein. Many happy returns :-)
@varungrover arre waah. ekdum sahi :-)
Oh wow @varungrover that's you introducing Rosie in the BV trailer. Kya baat! Cameo?
@varunscool happy birthday varun. many happy returns :-)
@AbhinavBhatt01 oh hahaha
@AbhinavBhatt01 hain? ye pi waali reference samajh mein nahin aayi.
@PragyanM @drdang @Tanweeer @MrNarci oh yes, that's the other thing. hopefully, film achchi hogi.
@GhantaGuy haan bhai. mujhe toh darr sa lag raha hai.
@Tanweeer @MrNarci @PragyanM I was waiting to be surprised. Also the 60s feel is great. Runcil, yes, the music is weird.
Kashyap is back. Hope the film is better. Cuz the trailer didn't do it for me.
@AbhinavBhatt01 you going?
@PragyanM ROFL
Booked Seinfeld show. Show cancelled.
If you want any other shows to get cancelled, …
looks like i am in the minority. nh10 was.. okay. not bad. but navdeep levels of awesome? nope.
@varungrover ahahahahaha, I've been acting it out for the last one week. every. single. day.
@mpmainka belated birthday wishes, chopda sahib. deri hui, kripya muaaf karein. hope you had a great day.
@flipkartsupport thank you. they delivered it today itself.

...@flipkartsupport care to help me out? what kind of delivery system is this that even aftr the supposed delivery date, you guys keep (7/n)
...@flipkartsupport The guy's name is Abhishek Shinde and he kept repeating the same thing "we will deliver it in 2 days". (6/n)
... @flipkartsupport What does that mean? Your guys didn't even bother clarifying about the so called "operational issues". (5/n)
... @flipkartsupport ...to my wallet yday. What is this? And when I called today, your guy tells me "it will be delivered in 2 days" (4/n)
... @flipkartsupport ...since the past 3 days. I have complained a no of times and as compensation, 180 rs has been credited (3/n)
... @flipkartsupport ...and I mean ON 11th of March, 2015. But due to some "operational issues", it has been stuck w/ the courier guy (2/n)
Dearest @flipkartsupport, regarding OD202269571204066800, what is it that you are doing? It was supposed to be delivered to me on (1/n)

I am looking out of the window and there's this guy shouting cuss words into his phone. Should be audible to anyone within a 3 km radius.
@mpmainka @Namrata_Joshi different hai. omelette banake use gravy mein cook karna padta hai.
@Namrata_Joshi sahi ekdum :-)
@Namrata_Joshi also this is only the second time I am trying this dish. Last I remember having it 21 years ago.
@Namrata_Joshi aapka?
So, I got the UGLY blu-ray. Was maha-pleased to find a second disc with the making-of. Checked the total running time. 22 mins. #facepalm

@invokeanand In case you haven't read it yet, you might want to check this out: 
@varungrover You'll be surprised to know the number of people who are eagerly waiting to watch it :-)
@DaMoViEmAnIaC Cool. Tuesdays are gonna be funfunfun now.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC I think it was wonderful. How is 'Broadchurch' S02?
@varungrover Funny/interesting memories while making the 'Dard Karaara' song? How difficult/easy was it? #DumLagaKeHaisha

@IbuHatela this is the best. why wasn't i aware of this thing before?
@mihirfadnavis no spoilers. I tweeted the question and you the answer at the exact same time :-)
@mihirfadnavis lol you should check my previous tweet.
Anybody saw BADLAPUR? Just asking. Intend to watch it no matter what.
@mpmainka @MrNarci haha, when I retorted, he looked at me, aghast, as if I had done something weird.
@MrNarci once I went to this salon to get a shave. the barber, while talking on his mobile, kept twiddling w/ my chest hair. #CantGetWeirder

Belated birthday wishes @MusicallyManu. Aapka bhi janmdin kal tha, apologies for the delayed wish.
@arjunidiot @invokeanand @silverlightgal @drdang Seen fall. Yet to catch up with the second season tho. Loved the first season.
@invokeanand @silverlightgal @drdang Best. I saw missing very recently and I was blown away by it. Terrific perfs.
@drdang @invokeanand Haven't seen. One guy I know has been raving about it for the past couple years.
Happy birthday @drdang. Great films, great TV shows and bigass spicy chicken burgers - all for you. Many happy returns.

@hedonist_redux @bolnabey :-(
@Appy_Fizzz Happy birthday Arpit. Many happy returns. Keep writing :-)
@thehistoryboy I started watching it yesterday. Didn't want to but had to stop as I was really tired. Whatever I saw, I loved.
For you, @drdang and @MrNarci: 

I died laughing.
@mojorojo Super OST and the film is no less good. Gotta hand it to Cruise. He at least tries.
@mojorojo One of the most under-appreciated films of 2012. Also, have you seen 'Oblivion'?
Yes, yes, because nothing turns us on like appalling headlines: 
@Pscripturient @diaporesis ahahaha, homerun.
@Pscripturient @diaporesis and trust me, am dying bit by bit every time i think of this. i will take it soon. @MrNarci you took it already?
@Pscripturient aww. also, i've been meaning to say this to you since forever but the same happened to me (almost) when i heard 'validation'.
Happy birthday @krnx. Many happy returns.
@bolnabey Yep. That scene grabbed me. What brilliance!
@bolnabey BF
All you skeptics, move your butts and catch the film in the theatre. Quick. Can't recommend it enough. #uglythefilm
#Ugly: Riveting and terrifying procedural. Turns into a rich character drama. Superlative performances and direction. #uglythefilm
This is perhaps the first time I've seen one of the year's best films in the year's last weekend. #Ugly
@anuragkashyap72  #GetUglyWithAnurag There were rumors that we'd get to see a Director's Cut version of No Smoking. Will we?
@anuragkashyap72  #GetUglyWithAnurag Have you ever completed a screenplay and then abandoned it thinking 'Nahin ye bekaar hai'. Details pls?
@bolnabey You saw 'Ugly'?
@bolnabey Love NS. Loved it the first time I saw it, even though a lot of it went over the top of my head. Ugly, will see tonight.
@bolnabey For me, Black Friday &gt; No Smoking = Gulaal &gt; Gangs = Paanch &gt; DevD &gt; TGIYB. So yeah, I think Gulaal is a mini masterpiece.
YAY..WHAT?

I loved #PK. Nosedives in second half, but Hirani knows how to tell a story. And sometimes, that's all that matters.
Don't RT hashtag boycott&lt;filmname&gt;. Morons might, and to a greater extent, will get swayed by such things.
Yes! That's Vinod Tripathi. 
Happy birthday @Plebeian42. Many happy returns.
@NotSoSnob Predestination, '71is also out.
@jahanbakshi Okay. Haven't seen it. At office.
@jahanbakshi BH?
@SandeepLoyalka True. You've seen it already? Or planned for later.
@SandeepLoyalka @ReelReptile So so true. Hirani has earned it.
@anuragspks That's asking too much :p
Not reading *any* tweet that is even remotely related to PK. Tickets already booked.
1. Cowards shouldn't bankroll political satire.
@chhabs You almost had me at 'genius film critic'.
@vavilikolanu @invokeanand @MrNarci @mpmainka just saw. dynamically disappointing. puke.
Which also reminds me that Ashutosh Gowarikar hasn't made a half decent film in 10 years.
10 years of #Swades. And the movie is still endlessly watchable.
There are no words left really.
@drdang I completely skipped that portable part of your tweet. I'll get back to you within a few if I find something else :-)
@drdang Sennheiser HD201.
@varungrover So true. I have always wanted to ask you this: which dhinchak gaana/album (from the 90s) do you enjoy listening to?
Terrible news to wake up to. #Sydney
I have no idea what to make of this suggestion but when you search for laptop skins on amazon, this shows up. 

@HTBrunch #Dialoguebaazi 
@ITwalaBoy Hey thanks bro :-)
@Punch_a_Tantra @appadappajappa Nope. Titli is next year.
@varungrover Damn.
What the fuck? 'Titli' releases on 26th as well. Imma lose my consciousness anytime soon.
I was about to give up on looking forward to any other film this yr, but along comes the news that #Ugly releases on Dec 26th. Super stoked.
@mpmainka Thanks Chopda sahib :-)
@IbuHatela Aye Mohit, did you shower or not? I did.
@MrNarci Yes, kinda turned off by all these.
Happiest birthday wishes @MeeMeera. Many happy returns.
@p1j @Outlookindia @Namrata_Joshi :-)
@anuragkashyap72 Welcome back, good sir.
Jesus. The messy behind-the-scenes segment of the Jobs biopic scripted by Sorkin: 
@drdang Alright, I'm seeing this, like, 734 days later, but there is one at Bangalore - Urvashi Cinemas. It's pretty awesome.
@invokeanand @SumitPurohit the tweet has been deleted (related to Coherence from what I gather). no worries. i am late to the party :-)
@SumitPurohit I loved Predestination. Preposterous but gorgeously executed. Loved it. Yet to see Coherence.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC Happy birthday Dada. May you get to see the bestest films and eat bestest food all year long :-)
@SahilRiz haha, yes.
@SahilRiz chintoo candy chintoo candy :D
@tanejamainhoon +1 to that.
@tanejamainhoon Ah no no. I meant 'left out' in that tweet.
@tanejamainhoon Fargo, True Detective, The Leftovers, Hannibal, Silicon Valley. In that very order.
@tanejamainhoon Point taken. I left out Fargo, which is prolly THE best I've seen this year.
@tanejamainhoon True. Some of the lesser seen shows this year have made the biggest splash. Case in point - The Leftovers, The Knick.
@hedonist_redux @singh_dr @hims_negi Pliss to forgive. Loaded w/ work at office. Missing out on this awesome thread.
@hedonist_redux @hims_negi Kai Po Che from 2013 is a gem. Also Raanjhanaa, Lootera. From '14, it's the one and only 'Haider'.
@SahilRiz +n. Warner has a history of badly publicizing terrific films, like Trick r' Treat, Iron Giant and now EoT.
@Navjotalive waah bhai waah. chhupe rustam nikle tum toh. incredibly well made. direction solid hai.

@Tanweeer I am going to do something similar in the morning. I will let you know.
Happy birthday @GhantaGuy.
@NotSoSnob @guneetm @sachinchatte the right person to answer this would be @HarishMallya
Right. 
"Everybody keeps asking me if I am back. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!" A line so meta, and so beautifully delivered by Keanu Reeves.
Yes.
One week later, the magic still lives on.
@varungrover you must have had to go through a series of captcha texts to be able to post this tweet :p
Call me a Nolantard, call me names, whatever you like. But I thinks #Interstellar ranks amongst Nolan's best films.
@NotSoSnob I wish I could see a Nolan film like that :-)
@bolnabey organ music, organ music, organ music everywhere.
@NotSoSnob You really had been avoiding all the featurettes and promotional stuff, hadn't you?
@SumitPurohit I agree. Just sometimes though.
@amitsom true :-)
@SumitPurohit Yes, there's a fair bit of exposition in INCEPTION too. But the film is, in no way, pretentiously complex.
I am reading Rangan's INTERSTELLAR review and the prev tweet is wrt what he's written about Nolan over-complicating simple things.
The opening dream-within-a-dream sequence in INCEPTION is prolly the bravest, most audacious opening sequence one could ask for.
@AbhinavBhatt01 ah, thanks bhai :-)
@thehistoryboy Bin-go!
The THR writers' roundtable: 

Access to the direct site unavailable from office.
Christopher Nolan day.
@psemophile Me too. I've heard (read rather) Chris Nolan curse once. In the guardian piece.
@Filmy_Keedaa ACE!
"Yaad hai, pichhli baar uske subconscious ne humari band baja di thi?"
So STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS it is then. The hindi version should be a no-brainer in this case - ZALZALA JAAG UTHA. #excuse #byebye
@bolnabey @anuragspks @hedonist_redux Batata hun kuch der mein.
@anuragspks @hedonist_redux @bolnabey haha, haan bhai. main ghar chhod ke bhaag gaya tha.
@rmanish1 bilkul :-)
@SupraMario I would prefer Fincher of 'Zodiac' to direct just about anything. 'Gone Girl' was great, but too easy for Fincher.
@anuragspks Interstellar.
One year from now. One day from now.
one of the best TV shows of all time plain and simple
and fuck M Night…
Last 3 Hindi movies watched: Rang Rasiya, Roar, Super Nani
@invokeanand Bangalore.
@invokeanand Gravity in IMAX.
@psemophile @invokeanand i saw it at a local theater. in hindi, no less ("itne serious kyun ho bete?"). ran there for 4 days. saw thrice.
@bolnabey @anuragspks @hedonist_redux still ahead of most films (being made today) visually. Daylight noir doesn't ring too many bells.
Okay, I did not see this one coming: 

#Interstellar
@NotSoSnob exactly what I wrote. fincher could direct this one in his sleep.
@ReelReptile tell me how was it. TELL ME NOOOOOW! *please*
@drdang haha! gotta love how magazines twist a statement out of context every single time.
@hedonist_redux @bolnabey cool. but how did you get into TDK w/o watching bb?
@psemophile when for?
@bolnabey @hedonist_redux I loved it too. prestige and tdk are clear faves tho.
@AbhinavBhatt01 acha. maine app ke thru book karne ki koshish ki. friday ke night shows sold out dikha raha tha, day shows available the.
@AbhinavBhatt01 ohh, friday ki tickets li tumne? ya sat?
@AbhinavBhatt01 fuck. main jab book kar raha tha, sold out dikha raha tha. isliye maine saturday ka book kiya.
@SandeepLoyalka Acha. I had problems with Oculus. Let me catch The Babadook and we'll discuss.
@Airtel_Presence I request you not to call me please. Please.
@anuragspks friday ko normal theater mein dekhunga.
@AbhinavBhatt01 Bhai, IMAX ke to tickets khatam bhi ho chuke hain. Mujhe Saturday ke mile. 2nd row seats.
Alright, wow! I'd missed this somehow: 
@IbuHatela Arre bahut saare films miss ho gaye the uss list mein.
You know who fucked up my chances of catching INTERSTELLAR in IMAX on the first day? Airtel network, that's who!
I fucked up. Will see INTERSTELLAR in IMAX only on Saturday :-(
@SandeepLoyalka Sahi baat sir ekdum. Kab? Friday?
@RanjibMazumder @invokeanand @Harneetsin @ReelReptile @Tanweeer Haha, Mr.Meow, I was just doing an advanced twitter search.
@AbhinavBhatt01 Yes, Happy new year 20(1/4) actually.
Hahahahaha. I tweeted this on 01st Jan, 2014. Hahahahaha. #WeGetToSeeOnlyOne


"We are West Africans. We are not a virus." #Ebola …
@invokeanand Yes. I have stopped reading anything and everything about the film and its reviews. Fingers crossed now.
@NotSoSnob Boyhood also.
...last RT cc @psemophile
@LouLumenick You're welcome.
@LouLumenick Just one minor fumble in the review - Lithgow doesn't play McConaughey's dad, he plays his father-in-law in the film.
JJ Abrams' handwriting. So much &lt;3
@drdang @ashwinsuresh Bingo.
Another step towards the dark ages. Sigh.
@drdang @bolnabey @invokeanand oye, 8 take padha hai ki poora padha hai?
@bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand i did. i dug it a lot.
@AbhinavBhatt01 haha. bike too.
a car dealer in city..
that is all. #haiku
@drdang @invokeanand ugh ugh ugh
@anuragspks yes. some of the worst.
Happy birthday @MrNarci urf dusron ko ajeebogareeb tareeke se birthday wish karne waale. Many happy returns.
@MeeMeera @PandeyJaideep @janiceseq85 @PujaNDTV @TedhiLakeer @toralvaria Ah, super glad to hear that :-)
@janiceseq85 @PujaNDTV @TedhiLakeer @toralvaria 
@drdang @psemophile @invokeanand let me watch it. then let's come back to this point.
@drdang @invokeanand so, how's the babadook?

Something must have got i…
Happiness.
Best. Tweet. Ever. RT@Plebeian42: At last, someone rejected an IIT. Glad. #Nolan
@NotSoSnob really really enjoyed the whole session. par ye ROM ka kya chakkar hai? bakwaas pe bakwaas kiye jaa raha hai bas.
@drdang @invokeanand haha, fuck, i was going thru the pt hash tag. also I have that film. remake, right? will watch.
@drdang @invokeanand also guys, any full length featurette out for interstellar yet?
@drdang @invokeanand er, hai kya yeh?
@tanejamainhoon @invokeanand @ThePuccaCritic lololol
@tanejamainhoon @RottenTomatoes I don't trust RT much. Prestige sits at 76% something. Nolan's best for me.
@mihirfadnavis interviewing nolan?
@invokeanand @drdang @psemophile will release in India sometime soon. shiladitya had tweeted that PVR has acquired it already. damn excited.
@psemophile you stole my words, bub
@beastoftraal She debuted with 'Game'. The 2011 AB Jr starrer.
Esquire's 'Films stupid people think are clever' is essentially a '10-films-to-see-before-you-die' list that's 5 years too late. Ignore.
@hypnosh @drdang @invokeanand pliss to forgive. bed ridden w/ terrible back pain. tweeting now chup-chup ke.
Tuzhse Naraaz Nahi Zindagi.
Mera kuch Samaan.

Gather around, boys and girls! 

#Interstellar
@drdang @invokeanand Nope. Any good?
@drdang @invokeanand (re the last linked i shared) if i had the money, i would have bought the rights and commissioned a TV series rightaway
@drdang @invokeanand Just read part 1 and this looks damn interesting: 
@stwta It is a poor derivative of that very thing, Mirza saab.
Leave application CB edition: deni hai toh do, warna kat lo.
Diwali CB edition: manani hai to manao, warna kat lo.
@bolnabey @hedonist_redux Luck by Chance.
@bolnabey @hedonist_redux A desi film has this kind of an ending. Great film. Can you name it?
@hedonist_redux I have lost count of the number of times I've seen the film and acted out the final scene in front of a mirror :-)
@hedonist_redux @bolnabey One of those rare movie in which every single thing is prim and proper, in place, as they should be.
@bolnabey @hedonist_redux 20000... is out already?
@bolnabey @mihirfadnavis Among the best I've seen this year. Please do watch, Mihir.
@SandeepLoyalka won't get made sadly :-(
Well, whaddya know, I saw the ROBOCOP remake last night and I didn't mind it much.
@psemophile Word.
@drdang @invokeanand 
@drdang ahahahahahah, hilarious. this is alphabet-yet-to-be-invented-grade stuff.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC Arre dug the teaser like anything, dada. Just that using it as a tagline doesn't work
@drdang :p i liked the, erm, B-gradeness of it.
@AbhinavBhatt01 Haha!
@mihirfadnavis Have you seen STARRED UP?
I *LOVED* the DETECTIVE BYOMKESH BAKSHI teaser but THAT worn-out tagline? Expect the unexpected? Tut.
This little short story here is gonna make your day: 
@SarikaGangwal Happy birthday, tasveeron mein jaan daalne waali. Many happy returns :-)
@Yashpal_ @invokeanand @drdang Oh wow, the day is sorted now :-)
@drdang @invokeanand I read it just this morning. Could not find part 2.
@drdang @invokeanand Here, guys - the goldmine. The 2nd and 4th are super-duper spooky. 
@invokeanand @bolnabey @stwta giantest.
@bolnabey @stwta ...na ki singham aur housefull dekhke.
@bolnabey @stwta arre aisi baat nahin hai bhai. subjective hai. chalta hai. bachpan swades aur rdb dekhke guzri, yahi ganimat hai...
@bolnabey @drdang that isn't as much laughable as much as it is kind of.. a compromise. but yes, his TL is a mine of chutiyaap.
@bolnabey that humor in the beer guzzling scene doesn't work. even some of the audition scenes. and the climax is really extreme.
@bolnabey I love it for many reasons and it is a path breaking film. I agree. But it is heavily flawed. I don't count it amongst my favs.
@hims_negi @bolnabey bilkul.
@drdang @bolnabey wahi hoga. pata nahin main usko kyun follow karta hun abhi bhi.
@drdang @invokeanand mil gaya mil gaya. anand ka tweet miss kar diya that maine. thanks.
@drdang @invokeanand mereko link bhejo bhai, please. main sarr khuja raha hun. kya hai yeh?
@invokeanand @drdang ? Which one?
@drdang @invokeanand I finished it yesterday. best I've read on nosleep.
@RajeevMasand Gyandeep, 09972487878, Asgard
Two of Lena Headey's films have posters that look like this:




Alright, this just showed up on my FB feed. Apparently SMILE means: sweet memories in lips expression. Beat that.
@amitsom having said that, i would also like to say that it is one of those rare films which i am willing to embrace with all its flaws.
@amitsom it is. i am not denying that. read the tweets that follow the original one. the humor doesn't always work. climax is, well, extreme
No feeling worse than the one that overcomes you when you can't laugh at a joke which, at one point in time, you laughed hysterically at.
And although its shortcomings are glaringly a few too many, I am proud  of this film. It is brutally honest, and straight from the heart.
And the camerawork is exquisite. The music holds up. Will do so for years to come.
That said, it isn't a.. bad film, for the lack of a better word. From from it actually. Works even today, stirs up emotions quite nicely.
I am sorry and you can hate me all you want but there are some things in RDB that JUST. DON'T. WORK.
How's the new film by our very own usual suspects director? @NotSoSnob
@anuragspks nahin ho paayega bhai. koshish ki, lekin kuch hua nahin.
sorry 5* months. 5 months isn't too long but when a parent says these lines to you, no matter what, your heart crumbles.
This morning, my father called me and I was babbling incoherently until I heard him say, "I haven't seen you in 10 months." #MahaSentiNow
@mpmainka @AbhinavBhatt01 Watch today or else I'll book tickets for the both of us and we'll go see the Kamal Sadanah film ROAR :p
@SandeepLoyalka fiction hai. mazzedaar hai ekdum.
Someone should buy the rights from him and make this into a film. 
@drdang @invokeanand And here's the one I was talking about: 
@drdang @invokeanand yes, i read up all about it. anything i could find. how's the book?
@drdang @invokeanand (dirt*) but as a story of two friends, it was just swell and mostly pushed all the right buttons.
@drdang @invokeanand i finished 'penpal' and the writing is just terrific. the whole dirc theater part was absurd though. out of place.
@drdang @invokeanand on a completely different note, read 'the spire in the woods' if you can. on r/nosleep.
@drdang Hahah! Dang and his jabs.
@drdang I was just about to say that. Nicely put. Look beyond Aamir and everything else is right in place.
Words. The best gift we could have ever asked for. Without them we would amount to zilch.
Nexus user: Nexus 6 is amazing.
Nokia user: Haider dekhi?
@eatanddust @mohantyambarish ah, cool. thanks :-)
@mohantyambarish @eatanddust Where is this? Pliss to tell.
I typed in somebody's name in the twitter search bar and for a second I thought it read 'you two blow each other.'
@koolsaurav_1212 Laxma and Suma :D
Hideous cover photo in the previous link, tho.
For your reading pleasure: 

#Interstellar
@bethlovesbolly @mohantyambarish That looks like Oriya definitely, not Bengali? No, @DaMoViEmAnIaC?
@hedonist_redux eeesh. what happened to the older one?
@AbhinavBhatt01 @anuragspks @hims_negi No rumors bhai. It was confirmed way back.
Sigh. 
@hims_negi @anuragspks That's an invalid argument.
@anuragspks @hims_negi Naam galat likha -Trevorrow' hai. Par kyun genre se door jaana chahiye? Samajh mein nahin aaya.
@hims_negi @anuragspks Colin Treverow. 'Safety Not Guaranteed' naamak ghamaasaan film banayi hai is bande ne.
@Mumbaifilmfest Two Days, One Night*
An argument in office just went from 'C++ is not called CPP' to 'TASHAN is a satire and AASHIQUI 2 is a load of crap'.
Don't miss it.
@psemophile @ShyFyy I must too, so that I can request them to turn the subs on! :p
What? Emma Thomas and Chris Nolan are still exec producing 'Dawn of Justice'? This is gonna be odd.
@ShyFyy @psemophile They aren't? I wasn't aware of that.
@psemophile I stopped watching after the pilot only. Thought will watch a few eps and judge but hell no! Huge price to pay I felt.
@psemophile @ShyFyy I don't mind subs at all. They are like an added bonus.
@psemophile @ShyFyy Also, I saw it on a normal screen. Not IMAX.
@psemophile @ShyFyy I saw 'Annabelle' just 2 days ago. There were subs but they were these huge-ass letters. I didn't mind them, tho.
The #MFF excitement is bloody contagious. Even tho I'm not there physically, I can feel that mad rush of happiness. Have a great time y'all.
@ShyFyy Super. Thanks, thanks, thanks :D
@ShyFyy One question I have and it might be too early to ask but is there any chance of 'Interstellar' releasing in IMAX Blr w/ Eng subs?
@Oomahe It totally was. Except for the climax which.. was very hurried. Otherwise very nicely done.
Can't wait to get back home and watch the walking dead. The second half of the last season was SO good!
@drdang @invokeanand super. thank you! i am halfway through this and this is super chilly and scary 
@invokeanand @drdang can't find. link please?
@invokeanand @drdang cool. thanks a ton.
@drdang @invokeanand right now, i am going through this: 
@bulu_bab aas paas nahin hai, par achchi hai. dekh lo.
@drdang please suggest me something good to read. preferably a link to some good horror.
They showed the 2nd trailer of 'Interstellar' before playing 'Annabelle' yday. The one we saw some 4 months ago. But chalo, dikhaya toh sahi
@drdang achcha. wohi socha. father's love for his daughter.
@drdang Yes. Can tell by the jacket she's wearing. Also, the love angle she's talking about is between Affleck and her or Anne and Matthew?
There's a love story somewhere in the film after all: 
Every other superstar was present at this place it seems - Zayed (hunk!), Dino, Bobby, Fardeen. 
Congratulations @ShiladityaBora.
@krnx Terrific. Can't wait to watch.
@Appy_Fizzz @Yashpal_ oh it did :-)
@Pscripturient @MrNarci @diaporesis *puppy face* sharm aa rahi hai. ek saal ho gaya.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC @Yashpal_ Haha! Release ke ek mahine pehle hi stars mil jaate toh log kehte ki T. Adarsh ne cake bheja tha.
@Yashpal_ hahahaha
This is a bit dramatic and kind of over the top but this beautiful thing happened yesterday.  cc @Yashpal_ 
@pankajtalkies thank you so very much, pankaj :-)
@Tanweeer Thanks a lot, bhai :-)
@silverlightgal Thanks Silverlight! That's one wonderful wish right there :-)
@SarikaGangwal Thanks Sarika :-)
@singh_dr Haha, thanks doc. Thanks a ton :-)
@hims_negi aapka shukriya :-)
@stwta Shukriya Mirza saab. Aapke liye kal naya dinner time table bana ke pesh karunga :-)
@tanejamainhoon Thank you, Nikhil. You're way too kind, I have to say :-)
@DaMoViEmAnIaC Hahah! Thank you mere dada.
@bolnabey Arre koi late-wate nahin. Thank you so much :-)
@rmanish1 Bahut bahut shukriya, Manish ji :-)
@Plebeian42 Thank you, fellow Ebert disciple :-)
@drdang Thanks Dang. I hope so too. Thanks again for that wonderful wish :-)
@Appy_Fizzz Thanks a bunch, Arpit :-)
@ThePuccaCritic Thanks Anup :-)
@ITwalaBoy Thank you Travis :-)
@AbhinavBhatt01 Thank you mere bhai. BTM ke iss paar se uss paar dher saara pyaar :-)
@slayer0929 thank you avradeep :-)
@SandeepLoyalka thanks a bunch, sandeep :-)
@kaurvaki thank you sir. bas 1 mahina baaki hai :-)
@ReelReptile thanks a ton rahul. how i wish i was there. next time I hope :-)
@IbuHatela shukriya mohit :-)
@psemophile thank you sire :-)
@vavilikolanu thanks a lot priyanka :-)
@Observer68 thank you shivam. bahut bahut shukriya.
@mpmainka shukriya mihir. bas itna mil jaaye kaafi hai :-)
@MrNarci thanks runcil. happy birthday to the guy who was born on the same day as rekha bhi bol sakte ho.
@invokeanand Thanks bhai :-)
Stupid analogy. The words are there in the Dhan te na song itself.
Seems like Bhardwaj has been trolling the BANG BANG team since 2009 (screenshot from KAMINEY) 
@invokeanand @drdang ...and even Benjamin Button is not without its merits. Have to revisit it sometime soon.
@invokeanand @drdang I see what you did there. Seriously though, SEVEN is a boss film. Fincher, imo, has only made two stinkers: A3 and BB.
@AbhinavBhatt01 Yeh waali: 
@SandeepLoyalka It will be. I don't think any Kubrick film was ever released in India. Might be wrong but I highly doubt it.
Alright, so this is coming on 10th November: 

I can't breathe.
@drdang I did a complete about-face re SK as an actor. Genuinely surprised by how much sorrow that chirpy face can carry.
@vavilikolanu Yes. Very understated. Genuine pain shows on his face.
In other news, I watched SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR yday. And I can't stress this enough but this is one of the WORST films of the year.
maru amdavad....wat a song..
@drdang 'Arre usko toh bhool hi gaye, add karo poster mein' waali feel aa gayi.
@ShajinMS Bad doesn't even begin to explain it. Now I know what @jahanbakshi means when he says 'lazy work'.
@drdang Happy ending waali - 
Ugh, that poster is so bad.
+ plight by exchanging glances at the 'disappeared' person's photo the other is carrying. Heartbreaking scene.
If I remember correctly (I might have missed it though) no article has mentioned the scene in HAIDER in which two characters share their +
@drdang Naaaiiiice. Mine would have TSN exchanging places with SEVEN. Baaki as it is.
"खाने के प्लेट में से जब बाल निकले न, तो नहीं अच्छा लगता।" - how I expressed my dismay at a restaurant today. Haider style.
@SumitPurohit Happy birthday Sumit. Many happy returns.
Mother called. Same conversation that we had exactly one year ago. 'Cyclone likely to hit on 12th, they're saying on the news.' Sigh.
"How can we allow such stuff to release in India?" Awww Stone age, nice to meet you too. 
@NotSoSnob And I think this is the same for all new android phones.
@NotSoSnob My bad. After going into settings, select your handle name. There, you'll find the notifications menu.
@bhatiayash73 True! Exactly the film that came to my mind. WoWS.
@NotSoSnob Go to Twitter (app), then click on the options on top right hand side (the three dots), then settings, then notifications.
How does nature plan such things? Exactly one year later? Sigh. 
@RajaSen The good thing is - at least we'll get to see the film. The bad thing is that the DVD/BR will also be censored.
@mpmainka @AbhinavBhatt01 Haha!
@AbhinavBhatt01 Rajju from Omkara, Ransa from Gulaal.
@AbhinavBhatt01 :-)
One month from now.
@bolnabey @tanejamainhoon @drdang @invokeanand Bhai, pranaam. Kaise dhoond lete ho ye sab?
@bolnabey @tanejamainhoon @drdang @invokeanand sacch mein pata nahin bhai, and i haven't even bothered to find out.
@tanejamainhoon @bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand absolutely agree.
@tanejamainhoon @bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand outside of films/related to films i mean. just read a tweet by MF. curious but can do w/o it.
@bolnabey @tanejamainhoon @drdang @invokeanand But I remember once M Fadnavis tweeted about KayKay horror stories. I wonder what they are?
@tanejamainhoon @bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand I am not exaggerating but I have easily seen it for more than 50 times. Deadly film and perfs
@bolnabey It is sadly. Lots of other things mask the single tune. But it sounds quite close to the extreme ways song.
@tanejamainhoon @bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand ...sorry, released* in 2007.
@tanejamainhoon @bolnabey @drdang @invokeanand It's a flat-out masterpiece. And to think it was made in 2007. Jeez.
@bolnabey Yep, I realized it too.
@drdang @invokeanand @bolnabey i am, like, 478 hours late to the party but how can one forget 'Gulaal'?
@mojorojo Just what I was thinking.
@thehistoryboy @invokeanand the last tweet makes more sense
There always comes a minute on days (days when I don't give a fuck about anything) when I don't give a fuck about anything anymore.
@invokeanand @thehistoryboy haha, 'more like life' pe hi bandh hoga ye toh.
@tanejamainhoon Yes, I can totally. And I accepted this guy's request because I shared some mutual friends with him. Now there are none.
@thehistoryboy :-)
This tard won't go away from my FB feed. Have never unfriended anyone before but this guy deserves it.
There always comes a minute in a day when I don't give a fuck about anything anymore.
@psemophile @MrNarci also the prices of all star and from hell haven't come down by even a penny. sad.
@MrNarci @psemophile just read in some article. can't find anywhere. apparently some diwali sale from 10th to 16th.
A day will come when online sites will offer you money for buying a product from their respective sites.
@psemophile such a sham. wait till 10th oct. amazon is going to come up with something great.
Don't promote that boycott &lt;filmname&gt; hashtag by actually tweeting the same. Condemn it. But don't actually use that hashtag.
@NotSoSnob Gods of Cinema. Very apt :-)
Tonight I am gonna break that one rule. I'm gonna watch that crap comedy show. Cuz Tabu and Kay Kay Menon. And boy, does Tabu look stunning!
@drdang @invokeanand exactly. was having trouble finding words. that's exactly it. and he hasn't seen the film. he's 'read about it'.
@invokeanand baap re. i blasted that guy. now he's telling me hasn't seen the film. he's 'read about it' apparently.
@invokeanand arre there is. but he just said it in a 'the film is bad. she's trying to do this. didnt make sense' kinda way.
Ahahahaha, the critics consensus of Nicholas Cage's latest is just hilarious. 
@jahanbakshi @bolnabey kya hua? gadbad hai kya?
@MrNarci Oh it is horrible in ways you couldn't even imagine. I was just appreciating the guy for asking others to choose the right film.
@MrNarci Jeez. Major respect. Just two days ago, I had a different opinion of him.
One of my friends just made this shocking observation: 'Tabu was trying to seduce Shahid. Lol.' What a fucking dimwit.
@p1j samjha nahin, pavan sir.
@drdang @MrNarci @invokeanand that, for some reason, always reminds me of the ramsays.
@MrNarci @invokeanand +2. Also blood on white cotton. Django Unchained.
@vavilikolanu esha deol, celina jaitley, zayed khan ka bhi video hons chahiye
Kashmir is Ghazala - 
@SumitPurohit yes along with desi kattey and aagadu
@MrNarci phuck you runce the dunce
@NotSoSnob Jabar. Jaldi post kijiye. Who's written it?
Best film of 2014. Tore me apart. Not tweeting the name cuz of obvious reasons.
@invokeanand @SinghAshwini @IbuHatela I completely second that. The monologue that SK delivers at the chowk proves this theory.
Katrina Kaif is the worst actress this country has ever seen.

Ever.
@invokeanand @rmanish1 I love even 7km. And frankly I am still surprised that some people think kaminey isn't a great film.
fuck fuck fuck just how great is that score in the new #interstellar trailer
#Interstellar final trailer: 

Check slashfilm website for a new Kip Throne special featurette.
Five, One, Three, Two, 2020, Half. Hey listen, why don't you just kill me now?
@Airtel_Presence without anyone visiting the location or following up on the issue. So hey, thanks but no thanks! (2/2)
@Airtel_Presence Done trusting you guys. I've lodged my complaints thrice. They've been closed without my consent and (1/2)
I hope this is true for the Indian release as well.
Alright, this is big. #Interstellar opening 3 days earlier in IMAX. (source: @slashfilm)
The #Airtel network has also packed its bags for the long weekend it seems.
I just wish people went to the theaters and saw 'A Walk Among the Tombstones'. What a film! But it has tanked apparently.
What amazing heroes our country has.
Does HAIDER have Gary Oldman in it? I mean, Asish Vidyarthi?
@Namrata_Joshi @invokeanand haha. anything on this planet is better than tards.
@pprfldr @Namrata_Joshi this one here
cc @Namrata_Joshi 

(ps: i am as scared of these fellows as you are)
@jahanbakshi @psemophile @drdang @NotSoSnob lekin haan, vulgar also makes sense in a different way :-)
@jahanbakshi @psemophile @drdang @NotSoSnob dhat. Vayask hota hai. Answered by @Namrata_Joshi
@Namrata_Joshi @psemophile @drdang @NotSoSnob ah, thank you. my mind did some subconscious translation and turned that alphabet into V.
@jahanbakshi @drdang @psemophile @NotSoSnob *facepalm*. ekdum subconsciously mind ne translate kar diya us alphabet ko.
@SacredInsanity Arre, aaj aapka happy happy hai? Happiest birthday wishes.
@drdang @psemophile @NotSoSnob ahahahaha, dhat.
@psemophile @drdang @NotSoSnob no idea seriously. bahut se a-rated filmon ke certificates pe likha hota hai.
@thehistoryboy @NotSoSnob super, super. even 7 seems like a big number but chalega. chalega kya daudega. 41 sun ke darr gaya tha.
Even in the written transcript of an i/v, VB comes across as such a polite person. At one point he says, 'Banaane kahaan dete hain, bataiye'
@drdang @NotSoSnob A-rated filmon ke certificate pe V/A likha hota hai.
That 'Haider-has-41-cuts' news is pure bullshit, right? Also, rated - V/A or U/A? Anyone? @NotSoSnob
@drdang @NotSoSnob I read it. Snob has given that guy a piece of his mind too.
@ReelReptile Super. This is great news, Rahul.
Orkut is/was the place where you weren't considered cool until you asked someone - "Aye, write a testi for me, no?"
@summitt_ Ahahahahahahahahah!
@NotSoSnob @thehistoryboy @Tanweeer snob sir, you already saw the film?
A lot of people haven't seen 'Martha Marcy May Marlene'. They need to.
One guy is pissed off bec the Achint Sharma article doesn't document the scuffle that took place at Madison sq.
A bhakt is saying that I am adamant and I am on some intellectual discourse.
Like always, I'll see the trailer of a much anticipated film after every last person on earth has seen it. #fml #InherentVice
The 'Kill/Dil' title song is... so, so good!
@chhabs Uneven acting in a Fincher film? If what you say is true, then this should be a first!
@IbuHatela @drdang not text. some guy with a funny accent told me that. coolendra.
@SahilRiz Raat is awesome. Even Bhoot was good. But Raat is pure gold.
@IbuHatela @ghaywan i don't think so. that's the date in the film's trailer.
I am doing some of the best acting in my life right now: trying to be somebody that I clearly am not. Or won't be. Sigh.
@invokeanand are you going to watch bang bang?
@invokeanand bms pe bangalore ke liye aaya nahin. pakka 3rd oct ko aa jayega :-(
How one man hypnotized 93% of my FB friends is beyond me.


@mpmainka @Apurvasrani me too. ro pada jab pehli baar suna.
Someone is 'feeling proud' on my FB feed. He's been feeling proud for the last 2 days. Seena burst ho jaayega, bachche.
I just saw some of the dialog promos of the new VB film and boy, what deliciousness!

Nope, not naming the film cuz.. SHATARDS!
@RajeevMasand NS at 1130?
@AbhinavBhatt01 @SupraMario Trust me. If I give them 30, they'll ask me twice for 5 rs change, and then, begrudgingly, they'll hand me 4 rs.
@SupraMario Haha! Feel the same everytime the toll gate operator gives me change for a hundred rupee note.
Last RT. My day is f*cked.
@ShridharR I don't even want to go to the washroom right now. I haven't seen the last photograph.

@invokeanand i think it is for you. slow burn, hard boiled thriller.
@vavilikolanu i dunno why but this word reminds me of several veggies rotting in a plastic bag :(
@psemophile off*
@psemophile gonna use this word real frequently now to piss of people :D
@invokeanand Did you see 'A Walk Among the Tombstones'?
@vavilikolanu spoke fluent english, btw. but coolendra? *puke*
@vavilikolanu no idea. some guy offering holiday packages.
Somebody just replied to me by saying this word: 'coolendra'.
@mojorojo Farrell's done great work in... big films too. Minority Report, Miami Vice. Such a terrific, underrated actor.
Does the first comment (Tata sky) make any sense? 
@DaMoViEmAnIaC I will see that too.
'Wetlands' is out apparently (via FB) #ykw
This article is curiously...anti-Fincher, don't you think? 
@pankajtalkies @drdang don't know how i feel about it. not bad. need to see a couple more episodes to see what they're trying to achieve.
Going to watch 'A Walk Among the Tombstones' tonight precisely because of three reasons: 

- Scott Frank
- Scott Frank
- and... Scott Frank.
@anuragspks @DaMoViEmAnIaC i remember the posters and trailers. havent seen the film. i remember military raj, saazish and shapath.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC it also had peter gomes (kalicharan, if i am not wrong) who had his head/limbs chewed off by this badass lion.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC haha! 100% i knew you were going to pounce on me.
@drdang hi leo iam big fan i love you not marry anyone else ok got it
... Barood, Phool aur Angaar, Jaanam Samjha Karo, Humse Badhkar Kaun.
Consider these: Pyar Koi Khel Nahin, Itihaas, Yaadein, Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam, Koyla...
I am not blaming them but whenever I've been to the theaters with my family, it's always been for some, er, shitty films.
@drdang a proper french beard looks decent on him though.
@drdang which film was this again? i can't recall.
@drdang also, saw gotham. i still can't figure out if it was average or bad.
@drdang waise i saw strain's ep 11 yest. yuckthoo. have saved a screenshot for you. will send after reaching home.
@drdang ...and Emraan Hashmi :p
@drdang really? you have some kind of aversion to beards, no?
@_sagart @SumitPurohit Waah, this is super!
If you can, and if you haven't seen it yet and were living under a rock (like me), find the 'flogging fight club' video and watch it. Fun.
David Fincher is a dude. Bas.
@drdang @invokeanand @Namrata_Joshi haan that can also be done. provided any device is still able to connect. 
@drdang @invokeanand @Namrata_Joshi par what to do? there's no 'forgot password' option here, no? or is there?
@invokeanand @Namrata_Joshi yep. best option. router url is 198.162.1.1. username: admin, password: password.
@bhatiayash73 whattay boss song. very well shot too.
@drdang @rohwit bg is toh terrific only. can hardly think of anything related to swades that i don't love.
The music of 'Swades' was released on Sept 24th, 2004. Ten years ago. But the album is still timeless and magical. A gem.
Has *any* actor ever won an award in *any* acting category for *any* David Fincher film?
@pankajtalkies @drdang watching cold in july. strain tomorrow. along with Gotham :D
@tanejamainhoon Gotham too.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC i will. this is a major surprise. everyone's been recommending the film heavily.
@DaMoViEmAnIaC thanks to you, i got to know that it has released here. living in a cave these days.
@invokeanand @bolnabey @SukanyaVerma I really want to take a screen grab of my iPod playlist and post it here :D

Dear ToI, do the words 'axe' and 'hacking one's own feet' make any sense to you anymore?
My FB feed is full of Kapil Sharmas.
@p1j WHAT? I am hearing it for the first time, sir. Please take care.
@stwta @IbuHatela @drdang Absolutely. Nakul Vaid.
@IbuHatela @drdang Jeez. And I've been told that I look like Yusuf Pathan :-)
@ReelReptile ah yes, that makes sense too :-)
@ReelReptile matlab dish pasand aayi.
Re. last tweet, source: 
"I don't know where RGV is, he is dodging everybody. I made Mast with him. Woh mast ho gaya hai aur main barbaad." - Bharat Shah on RGV
@IbuHatela @drdang This is the one that I saw on Varun's TL.
@drdang @IbuHatela Varun has retweeted somebody's reaction.
@lazygarfield In villages, it is even worse. Women aren't allowed to use sanitary pads. They've to stay in a separate room for a whole week.
@jahanbakshi any good? streaming not allowed at office.
No amount of hype can ever justify a new Gulzar/Vishal Bhardwaj album. 'Gulon mein rang bhare' and 'So jaao' on loop.
@jahanbakshi @MrNarci i saw that too. comes with every news article but disgusting nonetheless.
@psemophile dude dm
@rohwit @AbhinavBhatt01 Hahah!
@AbhinavBhatt01 cool. let me know. even this guy is looking for work. good guy.
@AbhinavBhatt01 You want to speak to the guy who cooks for us?
@IbuHatela which?
'Against our culture' is a joke that never gets old. Tell it to anyone and everyone. Either they'll laugh. Or punch you in your face.
I never though I'd RT him but hey, the guy's speaking the truth.
@SandeepLoyalka yes, read the synopsis. let's see how it turns out.
@invokeanand @drdang no. motion poster only.
@drdang Totes. It's like screaming,"LOOK, I AM PLAYING A GUY WITH A DIFFERENT ACCENT!"
@MrNarci God, this is just horrible.
@SandeepLoyalka @drdang i will. only after i read the book, though :-)
@vavilikolanu agree 110%. and i am glad a website can induce guilt and push me to do better.
@SandeepLoyalka @drdang haven't read/seen it yet.
@Namrata_Joshi @PragyanM @anuragspks :-)
Goodreads has been totally successful in making me feel guilty almost every single day. Not that I am complaining.
@PragyanM @Namrata_Joshi @anuragspks I've been saying this to anyone who cares to listen.
@pankajtalkies @drdang equally hilarious i think. he played one of the bad guys in lost, i remember.
@drdang haan, that's true. refuses to take a stand, disagrees w/ everyone, sleeps w/ his colleague after sending his son away with strangers
@drdang disagree. not more than his, erm, muse.
@psemophile @drdang yes, began watching it last night. can't wait to get back home and DEVOUR the rest of the eps.
@psemophile @drdang haven't begun yet. but bob, you'll be happy to know that i am familiar with these names now: ian, grant, becky, ww
@drdang eheheh. takes something special to make corey stoll act bad.
@drdang how's today's episode of the new kanti shah show? #strain
This weekend was probably the best weekend I've spent at Bangalore, in all probability. All because of #BangaloreComicCon
@pankajtalkies I am yet to read nagayan :-(
@pankajtalkies earlier ones: aatma ke chor, commander natasha, grand master robo, aawaaz ki tabaahi, maine maara dhruv ko/hatyaara kaun.
Belated birthday wishes @MusicallyManu. Apologies for the delay. Kindly to muaaf only.
@pankajtalkies Nagayan and Khooni Khaandan+Jigsaw+Ateet. All collector's edition.
@AbhinavBhatt01 Not needed. Just show them your mail/BMS message.
@psemophile Ye lo. Sketch ka poora version nahin hai. Aur sketch bhi frame karwane ke liye de diya hai. 
@psemophile haan rc kan stall that. badhiya ekdum. photo daalta hun thodi der mein.
@psemophile and an autograph+photo. Also got a few Raj Comics, superhero posters. Cards worked at the RC store after some trying.
@psemophile how I wish. Jo kareedna chahta that, nahin khareed paaya. Cards didn't work there. David Lloyd was there. Got a sketch from him.
Only grouse: no proper facilities for credit card payment. Baaki sab - A1 ekdum. #BangaloreComicCon
I was a little apprehensive about how good/bad #BangaloreComicCon would be. I am glad I went. This thing should be held 365 days a year.
@RajaSen Sir, where art thou? Seen two humshakals who arent you.
And here we go! 
Happy birthday, Hans Zimmer, you maverick. One 'Time' to rule them all.
@tanejamainhoon dude hi5

Am I the only one who thinks this new Batmobile is a complete downer?
@drdang agree. not frightening at all. seems like they only thought of creating the baddassest fingers ever. fucked up evreything else.
@psemophile @drdang there is one here. you've got to see it to believe how ridiculously hilarious it is. the book was way better.
@drdang that was toh completely hilarious. the one following it blew my mind.
@drdang which? the one where the old man says 'your father, what he does, takes time' right after corey stoll goes bananas?
@psemophile it's not shit. just a leeeeeetle bit overdone. and why no end credits?
@psemophile saw nowhere vidyalay. liked it. except for the shaky cam, may be. you are quite the soft speaker, eh :-)
@mpmainka you haven't missed much :-)
@ITwalaBoy haha!
@IbuHatela HAHAHAHAHA

@invokeanand @drdang eheheheheh, kya karein ab. i also get nostalgic about films like 'ek rishtaa' and 'yaadein'.

I want to see this NOW: 

cc: @DaMoViEmAnIaC
Ever felt hope and despair in the same moment, at the same time?
@drdang Ah, don't bother. Got it here on your TL.
@drdang Heh. Aaj raat. But how about Leftovers finale?
@drdang The other day, I was talking about this: 
Pros: Basically a masterpiece
Cons: Family doesn't appreciate "I'll bury you, cunt" at the dinner table
Shit. But hey, I'm not giving up on this one yet. 
Was nominated by @silverlightgal, @venkkeyy &amp; @iyeronik for #cinephilephoto and I nominate @drdang and @ReelReptile 
@IbuHatela the girl with the dragon tattoo. fincher waala.
@gaurav_q yes, excellent film. criminally overlooked.
@vavilikolanu @MrNarci absolutely. right lisbeth, right casting and most important of all - right tone.
@AbhinavBhatt01 @stwta ahahaha
@stwta Haha, not humongous enough :-)
#NowRewatching

One that is gazillion times better than the 2009 version. 
@MishterApu Indeed. The very last scene, where she starts dancing - terrific.
@MishterApu Bhayankar film ekdum. A1.
@drdang Ah, got it. The part where JE says 'Let's kill all the salmon so that we can continue using our iPods.' Cool.
@drdang Yes, please to explain. I just thought that's Reichardt's way of ending her film, with an anti-climax. Did I miss something?
@AbhinavBhatt01 Cool. I can troll CB now. Thanks.
@AbhinavBhatt01 should be teachers' or teachers day, no?
Is Teacher's day an accepted/correct phrase?
+ easy answers/solutions though. Loved it.
NIGHT MOVES: The ending (the very last scene) is sort of.. unexpected, which is a good thing. But the morality tale triumphs. Offers no +
Saw 'Night Moves' yesterday. Tense, riveting thriller about eco-terrorism. Slowly turns into a complex character study.
@psemophile Moto E or Moto G.
@drdang Frailty?
Happy Teachers' Day! 
@sandygrains Moto E. Look no further.
@drdang nope. never seen him before.
Some creepy ass guy, with whom I have no mutual friends, just shared my 10th class' group photo on his wall on FB.
@invokeanand read the gamergate thing i and dang had rt-ed
What the fuck?
@ShajinMS Haha. So true.
What the...? This actor's fans are nuts. R-Pat.
alright, this is super late but if miller doesn't like watching his own creations on screen, WHY DAFUQ DID HE DIRECT SIN CITY 2?
@SandeepLoyalka @drdang i liked both MHN and OSO (trailers as well as the films) but this one's just ugh.
@drdang do it. i've been singing in tongues since last night.
@amyoosed Nope, at the usual place.
@direstraits_ Hi-5 bro.
I couldn't get enough of Jack O'Connell. He stars in Jolie's 'Unbroken' next, whose trailer didn't do much for me. But I'll watch the film.
@ShajinMS Dekho. I didn't hit the pause button even once.
@drdang I will. Have the first one, the second I'll get today. But have you seen 'Starred Up'?
@drdang Not a single joke in that HNY trailer worked for me. Bang Bang looks like a classic compared to this one.
I'd been waiting for 'The Rover' and 'Starred Up' since forever. I've seen them now and they're both fantastic. Do not miss them.
Share this for good karma. #AD…
STARRED UP: believe me, don't believe me - doesn't matter. Give this film a shot. It is a hard but a rewarding watch. Flat out masterpiece.
STARRED UP: The great Ben Mendelsohn offers yet another textbook performance, portraying a hard man - ambiguous and unpredictable.
STARRED UP: incredibly well acted prison drama. Jack O'Connell delivers a stunning performance as a young convict. Endlessly watchable.
@NotSoSnob Ekdum baap film. Saw it in one go. Even the score is so, so good. Haunting.
@psemophile feeling afraid*
@hims_negi same here :)
@rmanish1 @Yashpal_ hahahahah, dharam paaji waali?
@psemophile What an asshole. This guy might get married one day. I am afraid for the person he'll settle with.
@rmanish1 @Yashpal_ haha, yes, that was the issue.
@ReelReptile totally.
@rmanish1 weren't rahul/himanshu nanda in charge of publicity? they didn't cut trailers then?
@ReelReptile remember the theatrical ending of the film was different from the one released on dvd? that was/is so cool.
@drdang should be*
@JordanKhusro publicity guys do it i think.
@drdang can't see. am at office. must be a 30-40 second teaser.
@rmanish1 @mpmainka no, no. the one where he advances menacingly towards the neta or someone by and pulls his cheeks saying 'alelelele'.
@drdang without any doubt. actors were also cast against type. but just see the trailer. looks like a hollywood film.
@ReelReptile me too. 10th ke exams khatm hue the. saw it first day, first show. didn't know what to expect. clapped like a madman.
@mpmainka @rmanish1 the one where he goes 'allelelelelelepoochikoo' and stuff, right?
if you can, youtube the aankhen (2002) trailer. whoever cut that trailer 12 years ago, did such a swell job of it.
@mpmainka @rmanish1 true. i even enjoyed 'family and 'halla bol' to an extent. certain scene hi sahi but the rks punch was there.
@mpmainka @hypnosh @drdang agree. still i wished the film well cuz #RKS4EVA
@mpmainka @hypnosh but yeah, to each his own. barring a clever sequence or two, i couldn't bear watching apkgk. @drdang
@mpmainka @hypnosh @drdang noooooo. rks didn't have a decent hit until he made apkgk. the mediocre film became his biggest hit.
@SandeepLoyalka I don't want to hype it for @ReelReptile, so I won't say how good it is. I saw it before the hype, btw.
@ReelReptile @MihirBDesai ahahaha, hum bhi theater mein-ich milke aaye miyaan.
@ReelReptile You saw? Has hard-coded chinese subs, though.
@PragyanM @drdang Oh, haven't seen the show.

Film Critic: Your FACE IS SLOW &amp; BORING. 
*actually says* …
@pankajtalkies started well enough, then became ugly and right now, is sort of a guilty pleasure.
@sashwat_k Aap kahan hai, sir? Long time, no tweet.
what the fuck no leftovers finale tonight damn damn damn
If there were a thing called 'summer movies' here, Grand Masti 2, 3, 4 and Housefull 3, 4, 5 would release on the same day.
The Strain's progress graph would look like an L curve.
@varungrover Haha! Ball ko park ke bahar hit kiya ja raha hai, main dekh raha hun. I tagged you in my post as well :p
I couldn't.
Also,no explanation why MAMI need this.
Bad communication.
Opportun…
@mihirfadnavis Happy birthday, boss! Many happy returns.
@drdang I'll give you that. Looks over-over-over-concerned *all* the time.
Alright, I am *terribly* late but what a brilliantly written article this is @shubhragupta. Hat tip, ma'am. 
@invokeanand Of course I am. In a healthy/good way though. Read this? 
I have never ever been to the MFF. But the joy that I get during that one week, reading MFF bits on Twitter is unmatched.
@rohwit @varungrover Like GoT. 4th season was pure liquid crap tho.
@AbhinavBhatt01 @Namrata_Joshi @SumitPurohit Haha, Jesus! Kahan se kahan gayi yeh discussion. Haha.
I really feel for you if you started watching 'Breaking Bad' but succumbed to 'Game of Thrones'/'Prison Break' midway through.
@hims_negi oh yes. same to same here.
@hims_negi we'll have to agree to disagree then :-)
@hims_negi dude, every organ of my body wants to make love to 'dil se'. i loved it.
Not tweeting the name because crazy R-Pat fans.
The film that I saw last night is still on my mind. What a powerful experience. What a haunting score. Want to see it again.
@hims_negi haha i thought of tweeting the same but didn't want to get pilloried by allu fans.
@hims_negi yes, it must have been from what i hear. but i totally dug 'raavanan', 'aayutha ezhuthu'. mani is allowed one bad film, yaar :-)
@drdang 
@anuragspks Main toh yeh soch ke chal raha hun ki Mani had just 'one bad day'. He will return. #LifelongManiSirFan
@ShajinMS Yep. According to this article, at least: 
@anuragspks Hit - no. Good films - yes (Raavanan). Haven't seen 'Kadal'. Read bad reviews. And also it tanked badly at the bo.
@anuragspks 
The day has come when so called 'actors' have started turning down offers for a Mani Ratnam film. Sigh.
Oh my darling dearest Iñárritu... so much &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
#BonerForBirdman
The Rover: The long wait was well worth it. Drop whatever you're doing and take the ride.
The Rover: Finds humanity and emotion in the most unlikeliest of places - in the deserted badlands and amidst scenes of shocking violence.
The Rover: As good a film as Michod's first great film 'Animal Kingdom', if not better. Both drastically different yet equally arresting.
@drdang ...how does one death not matter*
@drdang Exactly. Even if the numbers are correct, which I highly suspect, how does death not matter as compared to another?
@drdang Chutiyon ke baap ne baith ke calculate kiya tha. Ganwaar saale.
@drdang + deaths due to ALS - 5600 / No. of deaths due to no access to clean water - 3,400,000.
@drdang Yep. I don't want to share that junk but the caption goes something like: So you spilled a bucket of water on your head? No. of +
Have an internet connection. Don't have any brains. Will outrage. Assholes.
The 'number of deaths due to ALS vs number of deaths due to lack of clean water' photo that's being shared on FB is just disgusting.
@mpmainka Part of plot description of 'Shakthi - the power'. Note how after proposing, Nandini became a mother.
"Shekhar proposes to Nandini and she says yes and now they have a young son named Raja."
@stwta Oi!
That's totally how a director's name should be mentioned on the wiki page:

@Namrata_Joshi @MeeMeera @rohwit I heard it last night. Gave me goosebumps. Lovely, lovely rendition.
@stwta I didn't mean the question in a condescending way. It reads as such. You haven't reach much of CC, I reckon?
@stwta Yes, of course. You didn't?
@Observer68 ah, okay
@Observer68 Leftovers?
@GhantaGuy I really loved it. Better than Avengers on every single level. Maybe my 2nd favorite Marvel movie after 'Capt Am: Winter Soldier'
@pprfldr I suspect you've decided to take me to task. To make me weep. But hey, I'm not complaining. Keep those wonderful articles coming :)
TL, urge you to go through @American_Grrl's timeline. What you find there, is going to make your day. (thanks to @pprfldr's RTs)
@pprfldr @pprfldr damn. apologies.
@pprfldr @American_Grrl That is just beautiful. Thank you. I cried.
Next time, the 'women in Indian cinema' discussion pops up, say these names with pride - Nisha Pahuja, Faiza A Khan and Deepti Kakkar.
I've been humming that Creature 3D song since yesterday morning.
@ShajinMS Indeed it isn't. But who is this guy saying, 'I won't talk about that' to censor films?


#FacepalmKaBaap
@NotSoSnob Might find some help here: 
Goodbye, Sir Attenborough. Sleep well.
@stwta @varungrover @loha_katiyabaaz @katiyabaaz ahahah, correct!
@SudhishKamath Sheesh, my bad, Sudhish. I read it as 'the last ep.'. Sorry, man. But yeah, what a great, terrific episode.
@SudhishKamath That's not the last episode. Two more to the finish.
@varungrover just one minor thing. the show timing for cinepolis, bangalore is not 17:45. it is 17:30. checked on bms and multiplex website.
@anuragspks 90s music was/is always criminally bad-mouthed. as i see it, it isn't going away anytime soon. love 90s songs. not all but i do.
@anuragspks i touched a nerve it seems. what you say is true but tell me one name out of the four which is, as you say, good?
Why did I write 'we'?
Honey Singh. Kapil Sharma. Bhai. Arnab. We will always be mass-y. And we will always follow anything/anybody who isn't hard to understand.
This point has been made over and over again. But, majority of the population has embraced the wrong comedian(!) 
@varungrover Bhaisaab, bhookh. The rolls look delicious.
@SacredInsanity You'll get mad at me. Booked tickets for 'Katiyabaaz' 2 hours ago. Any chance I might catch it on Sunday? Or any other day?
@ReelReptile Film's good?
Katiyabaaz reviewed by @ReelReptile. Can't wait until tomorrow - 
Finally! Show times for a most anticipated documentary that make sense. Cinepolis, 05.45 pm. I am coming. Yay!

#Katiyabaaz #Bangalore
@rmanish1 @krnx Haan, bilkul --&gt;

@stwta rofl
@drdang Haha, yes, I saw that.
Movie plot of the day: 
@drdang Saw someone asking Gabbar for the link.
What kind of an asshole one must be to ask for a link to the Foley beheading video?
I read an article (of 5 pages, took me 10 minutes) and my Nexus 5's battery is down by 10%. I mean, what the fuck?
@SandeepLoyalka absolutum. love it.
@anuragspks @rmanish1 @drdang both released almost a month later.
@rmanish1 @drdang @anuragspks same to same here.

@drdang @anuragspks @rmanish1 It hasn't? Haven't seen in a long while. Saw MBBS again, very recently. Still love it.
@drdang @anuragspks @rmanish1 Oh you bet! There was a debate show on MTV, if I remember correctly.
@drdang @anuragspks @rmanish1 Yes, that was also the time I realized it's so, so easy to misguide the audience. Not the film's fault, tho.
@rmanish1 @drdang @anuragspks Yes, it wasn't overhyped but those commandos (in the climax) sure did overreact. V good film otherwise.
@Tanweeer Sahi.
@psemophile speaking of which: have. to. read. all. star. superman.
@ReelReptile haha, i didn't mind MoS much but yes, SR is definitely superior.
@anuragspks cool. i share the same sentiment.
@psemophile hahahahahah. yes, it's better than MoS, for sure.
@ReelReptile super cool. me too. love it.
@SumitPurohit I like MoS too. But yes, SR is superior.
@psemophile ah, glad to know. i hv memorized the film by heart and apart from bosworth's terrible acting, i don't find anything wrong w/ it.
Anyone here who doesn't hate 'Superman Returns'?
@MishterApu Cool :-)
@MishterApu Boss, big congrats! Jaldi dikhao! Super, super happy for you.
@Santoshmohan @DaMoViEmAnIaC wait, it's out already?



@KathlynGadd @lisang @mehdirhasan @IfNotNowOrg”
Right. Apt timing. 
@anuragspks haan bhai.
So, too much awesomeness happened yesterday. I am going back on my word. This long weekend *shall* be spent on movies 

@IbuHatela but bro, y aren't u watching star plus at 7 regularly?
@drdang @MeeMeera haha, cue 'main aa riya hun ki ja riya hun'.
@SandeepLoyalka Right. But also, maybe one in a thousand doing it for the first time :-)
For the first time in my life, I actually *have* plans for this long weekend. And no, it doesn't involve movies.
@RajaSen "I am Tashi... Tashi the great."
@drdang My head is fucked. Saw the 6th ep last week itself. The Wayne-Nora scene is tremendously powerful.
@MishterA @drdang Watching only because of those two. Love them.
@drdang Cool. You aren't missing much. It's a good show, nothing great. S03 was very good, tho.
@drdang Nope. Been hearing great things. Will do soonly. Watching the final season of 'Killing'.
@drdang Yet to watch. Btw, started watching 'The Good Wife'.
Dead Poets Society. Good Will Hunting. How is it possible that this man is not with us anymore, on this planet, at this time?
You never know how much courage one needs and how much pain he/she is in to take such a drastic step. Rest in peace, Robin. So long then.
@MeeMeera Waah, ekdum sahi.
@RajeevMasand Gyandeep, 09972487878, Adamantium
@silverlightgal definitely @sidin @vavilikolanu @poobrat @stwta @AbhinavBhatt01 @invokeanand
@BabaJogeshwari Mine too. This is the one where, in the end, Raaka gets dumped on some other planet by Sabu, no?
@Tanweeer i knew it was 'Pran'. But because the habit had stuck, I just continued for the fun of it. "Praatha ki nayi comic laaya hun."
I used to misread his name on the comic book covers. Praatha. #Pran
This loss is intimately personal. Rest in peace, my hero. #Pran
@silverlightgal @Tanweeer @anuragspks @AbhinavBhatt01 @Save_Arian This is really encouraging. Keep up the good work. Congratulations.
The deadliest virus is back and it's spreading panic like never before: 
@pprfldr ah, alright. hope you enjoy your stay :-)
@pprfldr + a restaurant. Not sure they've got rooms for accommodation..
@pprfldr + that they are from Bangalore itself. Somebody suggested 'Nandhana Palace' at Koramangala. But that, as far as I am aware, is +
@pprfldr Hey, you found some place? I asked some people yesterday and turns out they didn't know of a decent place. This, despite the fact+
@DoctorRadiohead Also, the end credits sequence in 22 is just goddamn brilliant.
@DoctorRadiohead Wittier, yes definitely. But the 3rd act in 21 was something else entirely. Loved the madness.
+ '21 Jump Street' is still the real deal. 22 is fun and has several moments of inspired lunacy as well. It works. Just not as well as 21.
Some of the gags in '22 Jump Street' are really clever and side-splittingly funny. Having said that though, I must confess +
@Namrata_Joshi @chhabs + curiously similar :-)
@Namrata_Joshi @chhabs super. will watch. been waiting impatiently for this one. have written a script treatment. the plot sounds +
@pprfldr even so, I will ask around. will let you know within an hour or so.
@pprfldr seriously zs i could help you out. have never been to a hotel (to stay). and the few that i know are in ecity and damn expensive.
@IbuHatela @drdang @invokeanand @MrNarci @psemophile Been waiting for this one quite impatiently. Has got terrific reviews.
Anybody seen 'Starred Up' yet? @psemophile @drdang @invokeanand @MrNarci @IbuHatela
@ReelReptile @rish69444 + that kind of business. not 100 mil, but y'know what i mean :-)
@ReelReptile @rish69444 apologies for delayed response. but yes, 100 mil is really far away. i'll be happy the day a small film does +
@ReelReptile yep. made the above point wrt to the vfx (and cinematography).
@ReelReptile Well, somewhat. At least they don't indulge in lazy filmmaking. Lazy storytelling, yes.
And it's ironic considering the fact that Spielberg is the exec producer on the atrocity that is Trans IV.

@SacredInsanity AHAHAHAHAHAHA
@pankajtalkies Mukerji's terrible voice dubbing notwithstanding, I love the film to bits. LOVE it.
@MrNarci @invokeanand @psemophile Ah, so that's how.
@psemophile @invokeanand acha.
@invokeanand @psemophile pata nahin. wohi main bhi soch raha hun. he has tweeted about it being better than avengers 2 and stuff.
@psemophile @invokeanand how come the writer of shitty comedies and korean ripoffs has seen it then? genuinely curious.
@SacredInsanity Yep. And that's the most interesting thing. They have thrown the 'premise' out of the window. It is what the title suggests.
And what a marvelous, marvelous ride it has been so far. 5 episodes in, the show plays by its strengths sans any compromise. #TheLeftovers
The only time I've turned my face away while watching a TV show is during the pre-credits sequence of 'The Leftovers' S01E05. Very violent.
@sandygrains blocked
Happy birthday @singh_dr. Many happy returns. Here's wishing you a lifetime of happiness and joy :-)
I THINK NOT. LOL #greatfi…
@varungrover awesome :)
@varungrover Done watching TD? Liked it?
@anuragspks arre nahin pata bhai. dekha hi nahin maine.
Nobody and nothing escapes the scathing gaze of Twitter. I love it.


Happy birthday Mr.Nolan. Thank you for making me look forward to a new day every day.
I woke up today to Hugo licking the whole of my face. There are times you just can't describe joy but hey, I just did.
@Observer68 Hehe. Those too. But the anxiety attack that you get while washing hands, unable to receive a call is something else.
The probability of you getting a call while washing hands is maha-maximum.
@anuragspks nahin. ykw pe aa gayi hai lekin.
@gaurav_q @Namrata_Joshi ah, okay. thank you :-)
@Namrata_Joshi English films will release, I think? 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Lucy'.
@ShiladityaBora AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEEEEEEEEEEEEE CAN'T WAIT! YAAAAAAAAAY!


@drdang correct. now the smug look and the smirks on the 73 faces on the E3 poster will have to go <CRYING FACE>
@drdang happens sometimes. willow creek, drive.
@drdang Ahahahah, yeah, just what I was thinking.
@direstraits_ oh. the casing isn't sturdy, it has the six individual BD sets inside. but for what it is worth, it is pretty cool.
@direstraits_ haan bhai, kab ka. how about you?
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta ji bilkul. the 'off-putting overtly muscular man' and people telling what they like in a man :-)
+ but the focus on the characters and the telling of their stories is a masterful achievement.
And I like the brave approach they've taken. They've thrown the 'event' out of the window. As a question, it lurks behind the frame +
For all the flak he's received for 'Lost', Lindelof seems to have picked himself up. 'The Leftovers' is right on track so far.
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta haha, yes :-)
haha some people are so awesome no matter whoever gets married the person then becomes either an 'uncle' or 'aunty'. bleh.
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta yes. my mind goes back to my place. the female gaze is there alright. but you'll never know what its sees.
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta back*
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta What I mean is, this article, the words are as relevant today as they were bak then.
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta ..changed since this article was written? It's hard to tell.
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta Done. Yes, it's all there in the beginning of the 2nd para itself. Very nicely written. Also, do you think a lot has..
@Namrata_Joshi @stwta I am already on it. Thanks for the link :-)
@Namrata_Joshi Haha, chaliye phir. Carry on.
@Namrata_Joshi Oh boy, that gorgeous, gorgeous man. +1 to that.
@vivzy Wouldn't call those bits cheesy. A bit self-aware, maybe, and GDT ticking off all the right boxes. Have seen it at least 20 times :-)
@Namrata_Joshi Oh, that's "off-putting of the highest level" altogether. Ranbir type chalega lekin :-)
@drdang ...and I truly believe that but yes, keeping things ambiguous because an actress is afraid re her image is, well, kinda ridiculous.
@drdang Ah, that way. Just read. Yes, that way, it's wrong but the article also mentions that doing it explicitly might have ruined the show
Yet another Android update.
@drdang No. Had no clue. And why do you think underplaying it was a bad idea?
@drdang Yep, and I loved it. I loved it that they didn't spoonfeed. Rare for a Hindi film.
@drdang I had guessed the reveal pretty much early on but it didn't matter. The film was so bloody delicious, I was salivating for more.
@psemophile @drdang i will man. i will. only 6 eps. but so many things to catch up on. juggling between SO MANY THINGS RIGHT NOW.
@drdang @psemophile Exactly. Ex-fucking-actly. The Eccleston episode was brilliant in all ways possible. Haven't seen 4th yet.
@drdang @psemophile how do you find *that* show?
@prrrince you succeeded. full marks.
I casually mentioned this to my mother and she told me 'Probably  because of sticking your face into the laptop 24 hours a day'. Heh.  Cute.
It wasn't there until a few days ago, it appeared as a tiny dot and it's been growing ever since.
Alright, this might look super gross but I have this dangling skin extending from my forehead. 
@prrrince hai
There's this guy I know who leaves a creepy 'good morning/afternoon,  haiii' on my WA/FB messenger but never replies back when I do.
@psemophile @drdang yep, absolutely.
@psemophile @drdang Yes, perhaps the next ep. They're screening it at SDCC Jul 25th. Must be something really good.
@vavilikolanu Haha, that's lame. I do love good and witty bookmarks, tho. But judging a book by its bookmark? Nope, that's madness.
@psemophile @drdang I am ashamed to admit but I find it perversely entertaining :-)
@vavilikolanu Lolwut? I got 'The Stand' from Amazon India and they gave me a Stephen King bookmark with one of his quotes.
Happy birthday @vavilikolanu. You are awesome, that I know. But your goodreads profile makes *me* want to do and be better. Stay blessed :-)
Happy birthday @MishterApu. Many happy returns. I am really, really glad that you are following your dreams. Hope you had a great day.
What a puerile jerk that asshole principal. I wish him nothing but pain and agony in his life. And death. And forever, if there is one.

@varungrover The prev tweet is not at all related to your question, though. Just a coincidence that I had it last night and loved it :)
@che_neeraj Arre no no, it is very much me. I am doing good. How've you been doing? Where are you?
@invokeanand @stwta @silverlightgal @hedonist81 Haha
@varungrover I have had it here, in Bangalore (from PH), and it's super awesome. Was introduced to it (haleem) last night, in fact :-)
@GhantaGuy +1. Also, he was deliciously creepy and menacing in 'Jack Reacher'.

@che_neeraj Where are you, Neeraj? Long time, no tweet?
@drdang yeah, but no worries. i will definitely watch the show.
@drdang no, haven't read the summaries. just about will.
@drdang @MrNarci AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, that's more like it.
@invokeanand but as it is, i think he did the damage control pretty soon and pretty well.
@invokeanand yes, had he not replied back and asked his kids to shut up or done what he did, it would have been perfect.
@MrNarci Well, you expected Zack Snyder, you got Drew Goddard :p #sorry

@Namrata_Joshi Ah, nice to hear. Hopefully I shall be in my 'neutral zone' by the time the movie begins. Also, DM.
@Namrata_Joshi Yep, that's the one. You liked?
@BangaloreBhumi @NeverJetLagged 'The Prestige' is my favorite. I love that film to bits.
Going to watch a movie tonight. One that I've absolutely zero interest in watching, even though it has garnered positive reviews.
@psemophile i believe it is. there's only one gory scene in the first ep and it's really violent and unexpected. @drdang
@psemophile @drdang first one. really really good.
@drdang I like it. The writing is a bit flat but I am willing to give the show a chance. Like the mythology.

@AbhinavBhatt01 lovely guy. really affectionate.
@drdang @psemophile @MrNarci rofl
@drdang @psemophile Agree. That scene was scary and well done.
@drdang I seriously failed to see why this was his dream project. Apart from the creation of the world sequence, everything else was meh.

@AbhinavBhatt01 @p1j @SufiyanaSoul @kaurvaki Baap re, so many tweets. Anywhere here's a snap of us three together: 
Love the 'goliyaan daagna' part. Lovely voice. Who says this dialog, if anyone can tell me, please?
"Haider, mera inteqaam lena... mere bhai se. Uski... dono aankhon mein... goliyaan daagna, jisse usne tumhari maa ke upar fareb daale the.."
I've been watching that 'Haider' trailer 4-5 times per hour per day. I want to watch the film, like, yesterday.

@Plebeian42 @IbuHatela I've seen iSTD twice. Even in the trailer, that smashing head scene was so visceral. I remember it vividly.
@Plebeian42 @IbuHatela also, malhotra's vengeance angle. tujhe tadp[a tadpa ke maroonga. that was the primary hook of ISTD.
@Plebeian42 @IbuHatela The scene in which Malhotra smashes Deshmukh's head through a window pane is straight ctrl-c ctrl-v.

29 minutes into 'Under the Skin' and this scene is so bloody unsettling, tears are streaming down my face.
@shivom_oza :-)
@shivom_oza That's what I am talking about. I can and I am (which might not be fair) I don't see those accusations as just 'alleged' anymore
@shivom_oza It is his daughter and wife who have had to take the ridicule. How is that he is being publicly humiliated then?
@shivom_oza Dude, practically half of Hollywood has stood up in favor of this man. Too many skeletons tumbling out of the closets.
@invokeanand 
@shivom_oza Yes, but how  naive it is to think that, in this filmmaker's case, one version holds weight and the other doesn't.
@shivom_oza Yes, I have. And I should have kept the word alleged within quotes but I don't see how that film is relevant in this context.
Ugh, just scrolled through the TL and WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, GARY OLDMAN?
I know it's not the best way to judge an artist, but for some reason I can't separate the alleged child-molester from the filmmaker.
@AbhinavBhatt01 HAHAHAHAH
@psemophile just add one more step
