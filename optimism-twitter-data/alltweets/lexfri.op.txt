@caseyliss I see a running giraffe
@emilygee also I hope your husband is doing better!
But I’m curious on her verdict: Will @emilygee keep taking UberX rides? If we all abandon it, are we helping or hurting the drivers?
Very impressed by @emilygee’s writing and reporting on life as UbderX driver: 
Word to your mothers.
@dwiskus I made Beyoncé shave mine
@dwiskus did you shave your arm in preparation for this shot
Jessie's girl has got it going on
@markosavic @mattalexand I SENT THAT TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE
@MikeBarnes4 @THR house is cursed
@markosavic WOOOOHOOOOO
@dmoren who won?
@jamesthomson @settern @siegel #nailedit
@jamesthomson @settern @siegel Oh, that’s rich.
@DanFrakes Did you ever review/test Decibullz? I want to believe.


@caseyliss @siracusa also, paging mac, which is in part why I’m closing tabs
@RandyJames75 Tabturday.
Let’s close some tabs today, people.
@PhilipMichaels to be clear, I deleted the OnePass from my TiVo before the first episode aired, based solely on your preview/review.
I swear I thought the fake cadavers on Shark Tank were a prank
I just yawned so big the moon got closer to the earth.
Sending big love out to @jsnell for the mysterious new @TheMacalope mug that arrived today at my home
Dammit, @dmoren made me want an Echo.

Dead to me, Dan.
@kspicknell Excellent questions. Working here does NOT require craziness, but it DOES help.
Thank you for your kind attention to these status updates.
In case anyone out there is wondering, I am working hard today, and it would not be fair to say that I am hardly working.
Stubble Trouble 
@mattywhatever Yes
They canceled Forever. Must resist the easy joke. At least for a short amount of time. Like one season.
@DOB_INC @Chilis (ass)
@DOB_INC Come back to Jersey, DOB. I got @Chilis coming out the you-know-what.
(Crazy because the corners are clearly the best part and because she married me.)
My marriage works because I like the corners of the Sicilian pizza, and Lauren likes the middles. 

Of course, she's crazy. 

But still.
@jeffullrich @tehvin Or “end of month soon,” if you prefer pure English.
@jeffullrich @tehvin Coming soon. End of months oon.
@viticci Ja!
@marcintosh @dmoren @Moltz that is so unmazing
If you like new episodes of @reboundcast, you will be excited to know that this exists: 
The new Audio Hijack makes my life better on a fairly frequent basis. Thanks @RogueAmoeba!
@BenjaminHerrin @ttcashow You're thinking of Bluum! Visit 
@AGoldmund let me remind you

some people call video podcasts

@KenJennings @danprovost what is, what I was making when I read Ken's tweet?
@SirGuthry as with Marge Simpson, it's the homer in you
Mute Siri on my watch really makes me feel sad. I want to hear you, virtual assistant!
Oh, LeSean.
Happy birthday to Flansy, the man who holds the keys to @tmbg’s Twitter account — and my musical soul.
@mollylauf @naturebox Mazel tov!
@macguitar But really, that makes me :)
@macguitar Just emailed you. Made screencast, it worked every time :\
@macguitar The “with” cue just doesn’t seem to work for me. Screencast to follow.
@AsherVo jiminy
@irwindigital hahahaha
@settern @flargh Aha! Thanks. I didn’t get that. Fun!
@flargh @settern On #15—how? I feel dopey, but I’m not following how to actually do it from that one.

Thanks! Sorry I’m stupid!
Today, with heavy hearts, we remember the tragic sinking of the good ship De Mayo.
@macguitar And is there a natural language shortcut (“with [email]”) that I can use to invite the way I think I did to in previous version?
@macguitar Fantastical Mac: I almost always want to invite someone(s). Can I always show the invite field by default?
It's great to be back in New Jersey. Honest!
@ScottAukerman Congrats on six years! The anniversary episode was laugh out loud funny.
@DanFrakes no, n/a
@united 5s
@united many flights booked. NC001608

Yep, that'll do.
Dude.

I like this ad so much that I would totally switch to Wells Fargo if switching banks weren’t such a nightmare. 
Material Girl blasting in the hotel lobby. The two women behind the counter and I rocked an emotional sing-along.
What do you want from me 
Spending 15 hours in Austin, seven of those asleep.
@MattGourley Also, I think the cat featured on I Was There Mew necessitated the explicit tag.
@MattGourley IWTT brings me great joy every time I fly. Thank you!
@gknauss @PhilipMichaels both I and my dignity have now exited the TSA line.
TSA Guy: Wow, this line is horrible. We should open up more lanes. 

Other TSA Guy: Yeah, but we're not going to.
This TSA line is free to get well acquainted with my taint.
@jamesthomson Also my first hit single
@Macgyyver @BOMBAS Luckily, my grey+pink pair remains unblemished. But indeed, I saw this hole, and my first thought was: darn it
RIP my first pair of @bombas: 
@GlennF keep asking me for many days in a row, and I'll tell you the answer
@nicolaguidi Can’t it be both?!
Here's my video hands-on with the United app for Apple Watch. 
My favorite two features of the United app on Apple Watch are when it shows a loading screen and when it crashes. 

Reliable and consistent.
@eveoster Excellent choice.
@jkottke @gknauss philately will get you nowhere
@NeuroticNomad Wow. You’re an animal.
@gte always running in the bg, universal key command to snag a screenshot and be ready to share it instantly with an iCloud URL or something
@dmoren @TheMacalope @BodyofBreen @jsnell @laurengsnell I have $48,000 of credit card debt from Zazzle incomparable mugs, is what I'm saying
@dmoren @TheMacalope @BodyofBreen @jsnell @laurengsnell then slyly grinned and said, you know, the incomparable sells mugs.
@dmoren @TheMacalope @BodyofBreen @jsnell @laurengsnell Hurricane Snell left many a broken mug in his wake here in Manalapan
@drewshannon @tweetbot totes.
@jsnell @BodyofBreen @laurengsnell @dmoren @TheMacalope While you're at it, we also broke ours last year :(
@tweetbot I'm finding the choice not to show the full quoted tweet curious. Can you explain?
Not paying attention to the Kentucky Derby because I have no horse in this race.
50% of the time, my Coin works every time.
@arsachs LA stands for Lex and Adam, right?
@gte I only have one feature request and it will never happen so it’s like the app has added humanity.
@gte It’s a seriously great app.
My son confused “lava” with “llama” while playing on iPad (“Don’t fall in the llama!”) and I feel like the Flappy Bird guy should make that.
@gknauss @jsnell here are the facts: I ask the app makers to do this, on an opt in basis, and to license the data to me. 

None do.
@markosavic the important takeaway here is that I am an attractive slow dancer
@markosavic SLOW AND HOT
@markosavic two adjectives that also describe me on the dance floor
@JohnPaczkowski Little does he know, America runs on Dunkin.
Bus or Bust II 
Can someone please get me Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, or Matt LeBlanc? Asking for a Friend.
@joelmmathis @sfsooz Great comments on that piece: 
@joelmmathis @sfsooz Goooooood memories.
@joelmmathis I don’t think “entitled” is right. I think fans felt optimistic that wacky Chip Kelly, so happy to dump greats, could do it.
@joelmmathis (or their fandom)
@joelmmathis Because you are coming at it with preconceived notions of hating your friendly Philly fans :)
@x5josh5x Really, it’s by @dmoren, and I’m the Vanna White.
Despite my solar panels, not ready to buy one of Elon’s batteries yet. Maybe in a couple years? 
But First, A Word From 100 Podcasts’ Sponsors: 
Customer service agent at credit card company just now said I should have a great afternoon, then wished me a good evening. Morning is shot.
@joelmmathis no one did
For sale: One Pebble. Never worn.
@imyke I do! 

Only other major benefit, in my understanding, is if your electric company charges differently for off-peak usage
@BreakingNews @Reuters I think you mean Constantinople
@siracusa you’re my density
Proof my wife is a saint: I've been humming the Austin Powers theme for the past hour and she still hasn't divorced me.

@lonelysandwich SOLD
@lonelysandwich @SlackHQ 
Anyway, since we’re besties now, when I can do a VO for a Sandwich video?
@lonelysandwich @SlackHQ But seriously, it’s so stupid that Apple doesn’t let you tap the whole notification.
@SlackHQ @lonelysandwich Fuck character limits.
@SlackHQ @lonelysandwich —voice.
@lonelysandwich @SlackHQ I think you're missing that you can tap on the word Slack at the top to launch the app and then respond with your—

@markosavic NEW NEW PHOTO ALERT
@markosavic It’ll change again, but probably not to gray/sepia Lex from @BenRiceM. Just gotta find one new photo where I look okay.
Screw you, Titans.
@toddthomas Checked — yes.
@CBSNews no.
@dmoren <GRINNING FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN>
+ly
I have a face that apparent says "don't sit next to me on the bus, stranger."

Or a scent, I guess. 

Only passenger without a seat mate.
@PSUJoeyLion You still can and do! He just doesn’t say his name anymore.
@replyall great, another tweet that i have to reply to jiminy
@dmoren sorry Cathy
After hydration, medication, and moaning, head feels tolerable. Small victories.
@toddw I THINK
@toddw WE LOVE TO ROCK
@PSUJoeyLion It was heartbreaking
Whenever I need to just zen out for a while, I consider the leisurely pace at which my MacBook Pro chooses to reconnect to Wi-Fi upon waking
It has been 0️⃣ days since a migraine woke me up and also I want to kill all the things
@DanFrakes @aaronlammer @blam @wirecutter I will do this for no charge.
@ryamidon I laughed though!
@ryamidon :|
Officially got my Coin before @Moltz got his Apple Watch.
UPDATE: It was Amazon instead. Sorry @Moltz.
LITERALLY LISTENING TO THE POUNDING OF @MOLTZ’S FEET AS HE RUSHES TO GREET UPS
@zachsherwin the people love you: 
@greg_allen Good eye!
Your Daily Lex shirts are only available until tomorrow! <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>


@jpetticrew WOW. Deep cut. VERY impressed.
Snell is in the House 
@dmoren sleep
@jsnell THAT LETTERMAN RETWEET IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE
@AGoldmund The former. And to share them with people who track favs.
Key takeaways from this photo:

I used to…

be fat
have long hair
have very tiny daughters
have no son

Life! 
@aboynamedboom @ttcashow Honestly I think @Moltz and @blurb were kind of neglected.
@gte @debugcast Let me know before they go live :)
Dinner companion. 
If @gruber is retiring, I totally claim #4a525a for my next blog. DIBS
@PhilipMichaels You were not supposed to see that tweet
A baseball game closed to the public sounds ALMOST as boring as an MLB game OPEN to the public.
@barenakedladies Done. Now what?
@imyke I had a period of transition when I made the switch.
@ohthattom I did!
Apple Watch always knows EXACTLY what I want to say. 
Happy birthday to @dmoren, one of my top ten podcast cohosts. <BALLOON>
I keep trying, but I cannot come up with a useful reason to use those Apple Watch doodles.
@dmoren @jsnell he = the in Klingon, the official language of Star Wars
@dmoren @jsnell he force is strong in that one. Or something.
@Hazbro @atpfm @clockwisepod mine was the cheapest ;)
My daughter just said she wants to see Star Wars. Although she made the second word rhyme with the first. /@dmoren @jsnell
@BenRiceM Not that I know of. Also, some say that turns on silent, some say Do Not Disturb, and others say shuts screen off? @settern help
why is my Apple Watch going into silent mode when I don’t ask it to

asking for a friend

okay, me
Watch, Fence, Etc 
@viticci @prenagha @getcurbi And, fixed!
@viticci @prenagha @getcurbi On the case!
The Rebound hosts send iMessages. 
@Moltz @dmoren I fav’d this tweet from my Apple Watch
There’s three days until we stop selling this Your Daily Lex shirt, and I’m starting to worry you’re gonna miss out. 
@JoshMalina I will invite you for $18,000. Deal?
@caseyliss @LexFreagles <BIRD>
@reneritchie FYI, on Apple Watch screenshots: I improved my reliability using Apple’s method (
@iMore @reneritchie GIVE ME ACCESS SO I CAN LEARN WHAT IT IS LIKE TO FLY WITH MY APPLE WATCH.
@iMore @reneritchie I WANT TO KNOW DAMMIT

@BenRiceM Having all kinds of Safari  *.google.com issues since last week. Killing me.

/sent from my DeadWatch
@jsnell I love that, though. I am happy that Glances are rockin’ it for you!
@jsnell You love Glances and compare them to the Dock. I hate Glances and compare them to the Today view of Notification Center.
@viticci @macpowerusers Wow. That’s awesome. Congrats to all.
@siegel Rich Siegel
@DanFrakes @Lessien My only complaint — I love and own the loop — is that it gets looser as the day progresses…
@DanFrakes I’m a nay on this one too, for what it's worth.
@simonstuck @tim_cook Restarted watch, still no password pop-up on iPhone Watch app. I do have 2FA enabled.
Many texts from my Apple Watch are going as texts instead of iMessages. Help me out, @tim_cook.
@blenderhd cool
Important update: the Milanese Loop does indeed snag my wrist hair. Oh well.
@caseyliss so noted
Always fascinated that airplane crews prepare cabin intentionally by placing every seatbelt in the least helped layout possible.
Someone on this flight to New Jersey is clearly exceedingly flatulent, which is frankly just adding insult to injury.
@jamesthomson I am so tired
@jamesthomson ok. And in case I don't see you, Chicago, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight.
Good morning, Chicago.
@AllysonSS woohoo!
If you like extremely unpleasant people, you'll love the counter agents working the early shift at LEX Airport (no relation).
@agiletortoise Wow.
@JoshMalina your cats sound like Gentiles.
Hey! My Uber driver is crazy. Kentucky is just like the rest of the country!
@DanFrakes @jsnell @jamesthomson I'd start with Jason's if I were you :)
@dnanian @jsnell @jamesthomson Jason was very, very dirty. 

This sounds weirder than intended, but I still want to make the tweet.
@jamesthomson @jsnell You joke, but I kind of want @DanFrakes to say Apple Watch is the ideal shower bluetooth speaker for podcasts.
@josephinescreen probably 400
@jamesthomson @Verxion a wristed development
@shoshanaberger <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@linahania I'll allow it.
@linahania is it electric?
@GlennF our babies will all be born on March 4th
I love a parade. We're getting married in the summer.
@DOB_INC order a za
@J_Silvestro so you don't have to compete as much :)
@J_Silvestro Podcasts are popular for folks burned out on screens, or unable to stare at them (because commuting or doing chores etc)
I said stuff!
@sophist_monster @shoshanaberger nailed it
@drwave “You sound cloddish” is a fine reply.
No relation. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE WAITING MULTIPLE HOURS MORE THAN EXPECTED FOR YOUR LUXURY ACCESSORY? Ugh. Thanks for your kind thoughts and prayers.
Upside to being in Kentucky: My watch was only *just delivered*, and I would have been super annoyed if I were actually present to claim it.
Lex to LEX. <AIRPLANE>️
@Gimletmedia @mathowie @AGoldmund SWEET
@Soren_Ltd @rayadverb I am insane with jealousy
.@YevP oh but I did. Here's a pic of me now: 
Today, I am but five pounds off my goal weight. Down 25.
@gknauss my flight was NOT cancelled. But I'm going to Kentucky. So kind of a wash.
@mathowie @Gimletmedia @AGoldmund I work for them and have never scored an invite. I am super jelly right now.
@AmyJane ANY pics?!
@chartier mine arrived
@jamesthomson herpes?

Your Daily Lex shirt from 
@harrymccracken worth it if it has FIVE mice.
@JoshMalina you misspelled defenestrate
My Coin shipped on the same day as my Apple Watch. There is no emoji for what I’m feeling right now.
@blankbaby I grabbed it for you
@laurenlapkus if your doctor comes up to you and says the word Mylanta, you're having a magnificent day.
@reneritchie I cannot wait to send you my heartbeat
@alyankovic that's exceptional
Watch This 
@dloehr Nothin’ but Lex!
@dloehr @_ryangoodlett I’m speaking at the University of Kentucky on Saturday. It’s a thing for writers. You’d hate it.

OH WAIT
My new watch will arrive in NJ from Kentucky as I arrive in Kentucky from NJ. 

Hooray?
Alert! StartUp Season 2 is out. Go get it! 
@mollylauf @naturebox @FortuneMagazine Nice!
@lancebaker87 email
My watch shipped. And will likely arrive at a time when I am unable to snag it. Thanks Obama.
@daringfireball (Finally.)
@nataliekerris mazel tov!
@Moltz @blurb really thought you were going to go with "yes I wish I still hadn't met you yet either"
Today I shall meet @blurb in person for the first time. Jealous, @Moltz?
@imyke <THUMBS UP SIGN>🏼
@DiFonzoMarks THE ARISTOCRATS
Someone tell my wife the Eagles are playing on Thanksgiving again this year.
@BenRiceM #podcasts
@MaxTemkin I laughed a lot.

A lot.
My next home will have a room dedicated to my occasional need for private primal screaming
@tjluoma that is SO CHRISTIAN of him
@astandy I honestly have no idea. Sorry! Hope everything worked out!
@Moltz I know of no shipping 42mm Milaneses so far. Including mine. Still processing. 

Process THIS, Apple
Totally oblivious to what people took offense to. Amazing.
Guy on town’s Facebook group advises: “Jew the landscaper down.” People object. He defends: “Just trying to help you save a few bucks!”
Your Daily Liam (Again) 
@ivan3bx Solution: Order two!
@markosavic @mattalexand he is!!
"Sorry, Lex, I couldn't find 'Icon Fuck' in your library."
Siri swore at me (and my son) after mishearing "Play Uptown Funk."
@DanFrakes there's no cable in the photo, but these are wired, correct?
@tofias I was so proud of @caseyliss when @blurb said that.
@mattywhatever next you gotta get a cat
I can’t record an episode of Your Daily Lex today, because of my hellish schedule. So sing the song and buy a shirt. 
Just texting about Tebow. 
@viticci Six more years! Six more years!
@jamesthomson I did not have this problem. You drag weird.
@dmoren (or as close as you've ever felt)
@dmoren as a frequent flyer and taker of too many red eyes, let me reassure you: you'll feel normal again in about five months.
@dmoren good morning and welcome home
Sign it was a good weekend: I'm going to bed at 9:30.
I keep imagining Chip Kelly laughing maniacally in a secret, dark room, surrounded by Cowboys swag.
I for one welcome our new Tebow overlord in Philadelphia. Of course, I've been drinking.
Don’t forget to buy the only officially Your Daily Lex shirt on the market: 
@davidjoelhall Yes
Escaped the room. 
@zhitnitsky hi
@megapenguinx @Caitlin_McGarry @GlennF :(
@dmoren that's not quite right
@jsnell @caseyliss @dmoren 
@GlennF Gnnnngggggggghhhhhhhwuhhh
@robdelaney but I didn’t know virgins could father children?
@robdelaney mazel tov rob!
@PhilipMichaels I will understand a full 50% of these references!
@ScottAukerman I would like this tweet tattooed on my back.
Pissing all over everything is the dog equivalent of the Internet. That sounds exactly right.
@paulmayne @Mailplane Woohoo!
@arsachs @abexlumberg If I talk about this episode on my show, it's a podcast about podcasts about podcasts about podcasts? #inception
@AmyJane oh man not you too
@EW @AnnaKendrick47 OMG that’s you!
@DiFonzoMarks @improv4humans WORLDS COLLIDE!
@Verxion thanks!
Your Daily Shirt 
"I loathe you. I will murder you and everyone you love."

— my dog, to other people's garbage cans
@Verxion just portion control. It is borderline impossible and I hate it :-)
Emergency backup cheese quesadillas built for 80% of Friedmans after "mild" enchilada sauce wasn't.
@jamesthomson about 25 pounds :-)
@marusula I haven't yet mustard up the courage to respond
@jamesthomson @GlennF this is one hundred percent accurate
@jamesthomson oh you. Go on!
@roblef @GlennF what's an x-wing?
Two of them — two! — said they cried when Chewbacca showed up. I said, Yeah, me too :-)
Went to Apple Store wearing this shirt today. Lied to about ten employees, claiming I'd seen the new trailer. 
@markosavic Reply to EA, BCC main contact while acknowledging that you did so.
@macfixer @ianpierce 

Mine: 

Marko’s: 
@macfixer @ianpierce Let’s try that again. Stand by.
@ianpierce 

My first: 

Marko’s first: 
Is the back of the shirt missing? Yes.

Will it show up soonish? Also yes.
@markosavic I’m wondering the same thing. Trying to figure that out.
(With special thanks to @markosavic for the design, and @jsnell and @siracusa for rejecting my own design first.)
I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, how can I ever get a Your Daily Lex t-shirt? The answer: 
@markosavic @siracusa WE’RE IN THE BRAINSTORMING PHASE
@tjluoma @Moltz NOLTZ
@siracusa @atpfm You’ve changed, man.
@mattbraun I regret the fbomb.
@siracusa Will there be a meta piece analyzing how you assembled the retirement post?
@mattbraun you fucking liar
@markosavic the tweet was a misdirect
@markosavic the cancellation hashtag was a lie
@reneritchie that was the name of my wedding band

true story
Third year in a row Tax Day fell on April 15. Probably won't happen again in any of our lifetimes.
Fewer sadder words on the Internet than “Giphy could not match…”
@tjluoma @reboundcast Believe it or not, it was actually an export processing issue vs the mic. I think. Do you still hear issue w fresh dl?
@ismh @blurb I can’t believe you called Jon a toady.
Brad and I 
@panzer homerows are bullshit
@panzer that’s french for hey
@panzer jeu
@ApplWatcher That’s what we aim for!
@mwarne @reboundcast @dmoren @ttcashow @blurb I knew you were British before I checked, Martin
@ApplWatcher I mean, still some cross-talk, but less. And fewer (no?) odd pauses.
@ApplWatcher If you can delete and reload, it SHOULD be fixed? Maybe? I hope?
@ApplWatcher @reboundcast @dmoren @ttcashow @blurb That’s the fine work of @moltz.
We had to do @reboundcast without @dmoren. So we brought in @ttcashow’s @blurb to fill in! 

Watch, Force Touch, etc.
Mac App Store + 2-factor:
Me: Buy this $2 app
MAS: Verify you’re you with code we text
Me: [Does so in 5 seconds]
MAS: Still wanna buy it?

Has anyone seen Alanis Morrissette recently?
Speaking of sex, nothing turns me on like the subject lines in my work spam folder. 
@PhilipMichaels THERE WAS A FOLLOWUP
I also feel a camaraderie with people whose names rhyme with “sex.”
I feel a camaraderie with people named Max. Three letter names, middle a vowel, first letter nearly halfway through the alphabet, final x.
@JoshMalina @MattGourley Hey, you were in The American President. I can put in a good word with Matt for you if you’d like.
@mattalexand @markosavic I did misspell DISCLOSED, and made it sound dirty.
@chockenberry do you want to know how to reuse a condom

shake the fuck out of it

goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow
@markosavic @mattalexand I ALREADY DICLOSED THAT I AM YOUR MARK CUBAN, MARKO
@mattalexand <BALLOON>!
@mattalexand Sorry
@mattalexand Let me know if you want to promote it on podcasts! I can offer up recommendations on podcast ads from @markosavic. For real!
@chockenberry my timing might suck but: happy birthday! You are respected and admired by many humans, including this one.
@laurenlapkus I can't figure out if you are referring to Allison Janney or not
@shwood you're welcome!!!
@JordanWMinor @CAH @MaxTemkin Sounds like Mag’s tempin plus Max Temkin lead to success I’ll show myself out good day I said good day

@hotdogsladies Thanks!
Did I ever share with you my daughter’s (unfinished) website? It’s here: 
@hotdogsladies Here’s some background on Anya for what it's worth: 
@hotdogsladies The internet tells me you might have recommendations for a precocious 8-year-old named Anya who wants to get into comic books
Let's Take It Outside 
@panzer I knew one day you would appreciate my work
@bendodson The answers are way easier to save this way :-)
I love the internet
@jeffcarlson do I buy the comic books themselves? Do I use an app? I'm out of my depth.
@rmogull @jsnell she just love language and reading. I got her word girl because she likes word girl. I just don't want crazy violence.
Help me Internet: 8-year-old would love to read more comic books. She loves Word Girl comics. This is not my area of expertise. Suggestions?

@GlennF hi, I'm Lex Friedman. I trim my own nose hairs, so I know from experience: the gray ones are the toughest to cut

@OptimumOffers hmm. You DM me first? 
@OptimumOffers So... Will you? I'm already following.
@OptimumOffers I think you have to follow me back
@mrdavehill I can’t take my puppy there, because he isn’t neutered yet. But I showed them: I went alone and humped every dog there.
@OptimumOffers I lost my promo rate and I’m sad. My wife has tasked me with evaluating directv instead. Help me save cable and my marriage.
@markosavic :|
The system works! 
@DanFrakes (Until the inevitable teardown, I mean.) But it’s not at all obvious anything unusual is happening.
@DanFrakes I was thinking yesterday that Apple could have revealed nothing about the tech behind the trackpad and no one would have known.
@jamesthomson If I could just ruin a few minutes of your day, then my work here is done ;)
@jamesthomson It wasn’t meant to be a trick! I’m just really surprised that they still haven’t published those tutorials.
No rush. 
@offworldgames honestly, I still play it, and still love it, and wish it were updated :-) checking on the KS now.
@laurenlapkus can I have some
@GlennF definitely, but troll is continuing to troll
to be clear, the EFF has done incredible work with the podcasting patent troll. But the work isn't over, which they are 1st to acknowledge.
@DanFrakes barely related: I am shocked at how heavy my new MacBook Pro is
@GlennF @Moltz @dmoren I bought a watch. Did you?
@macguitar My Fantastical 2 Mac notifications started showing up a few hours late today. Not sure why. It’s a big eek-inducer!
@zhitnitsky No seriously, is acomfortable comfortable or not comfortable
@zhitnitsky WHAT THE HELL IS ACOMFORTABLE
@NeXTfanboy that’s gonna cost you

@arsachs @jeffullrich @msuster @JohnBonini

This Apple Watch fits me like a glove.

Wait a second. 

This is a glove.

Never mind.
@CBSNews Yes. Do you guys not read the news there?
Again?! I only have one wrist. Well, that I wear watches on, anyway. 
@rands spent all night wondering if this was about me
@zhitnitsky 42mm Milanese or GTFO

I force-quit it and relaunched. Photos asked to repair some permissions. Already at 3%! What a great day.
If Photos has been here for an hour, do I kill it and relaunch or what?

@mauricerkelly I’ll endeavor to make sure you aren’t exposed to such blatant insensitivity again.
@joelmmathis phones have replaced that functionality
@mauricerkelly people who actually say that are saying nothing needs to change. I’m saying exactly the opposite.
@mauricerkelly technically YOU just said “Not all cops.”
Most cops aim to do the right thing. But still — something's gotta change. 
@Moltz at camp?!!?!?!????!!

@rgriff HOW ABOUT NOW
Your friend and mine, @PFTompkins, launched a new Earwolf show today. You may recognize it as the #1 show in iTunes.

I Periscoped part of this @reboundcast. The best part, you might say. (If you like being wrong.) 
I got a voicemail for Danny. I am not Danny. But according to the woman who called, Danny is a f--king a--hole, in case you were wondering.
“I don’t have any April Fools jokes to make. Just kidding, I do, April Fools!”

@adamengst @dmoren I have two.

Both are female.

One is three years old and friends with my kids.

The other is involved in the theater.
This week’s Dial-a-Song from @tmbg is an awesome with an amazing, magic-themed video. 
@capttaco I fear this is a trick!
@realoren you forgot the whip clip hashtag bro
@jakerubindc HaShem would spell it “fatty."
@macfixer @viticci @caseyliss I find charming.
@macfixer @viticci @caseyliss I was vague. I’m okay with April Fools Day pranks. Most are stupid. But ones done well, with thought and care—
@queuebit First time I’ve disagreed with John that I can remmeber.
@viticci @caseyliss I fav’d Ticci’s before I tweeted mine. There’s a lot of April Fools Day hate out there. I’m okay with it.
I for one welcome your April Fools Day internet prank.
@macguitar Woo!
@macguitar Apple’s vanish when the meeting ends
@macguitar Apple’s doing it via a private method or something? (Real question. I assume yes!)
@macguitar This is a meeting with one yes and two no-responses, for what it's worth
@macguitar Nope, talking about this (see screenshot). I want these Notification Center banners to disappear post-mtg.

@macguitar I want my Notification Center reminders to go away when the meeting ends, or perhaps even halfway through the meeting. Possible?

TSA agent: Anyone here an Eagles fan?

Me, surprised: Me. 

Agent: Ok, everyone behind Eagles Fan can move into this new, faster line.
@mollylauf you know so many lexes!
I just took the last available electric car charging parking spot at Newark Airport. Feeling elated but guilty.
@RHoustonBridges I have no research to back that up
@RHoustonBridges Sarah Childress Polk sounds like a real bitch
@AllysonSS Michelle Obama said the same thing
@AllysonSS this is true.
Michelle Obama is the only First Lady I've ever really wanted to be friends with. 
@Soren_Ltd let's find each other and say hi!!!
Back in New Jersey. Don't know the next time I'll visit beautiful Newark Liberty International Airport. 

(It's tomorrow.)
@AdamSchefter I love that of all the words to misspell in that tweet, the sole typo was in Rams.
Happy birthday, @macgreg! <BALLOON>
@suckeffect @dmoren Dan picks easy puns. I Picard ones.
@SlackHQ Why does this happen to my coworker from time to time? 
@siegel @dmoren I’ll save math that complicated for …

wait for it …

@dmoren I hope no one Shatner breakfast cereal

Don’t tweet this Lex

Don’t tweet this 

Too late
@dmoren I khan’t deny it
@dmoren khan job
@dmoren You’re describing the Wrath of Crêpes.
@danielpunkass @siracusa @dmoren Brought to you by MarsEdit and Squarespace 5
@viticci I gotta DM you on that one :)
@viticci wait
@danielpunkass Buy Viagra
@PBones Can’t believe you didn’t come out to dinner last night. I was sending you SO MANY VIBES about joining us!

* I regret the oversight.
@MrJoshCharles Why couldn't TGW find a better body double for you?
I use the word "Milanese" way more than I used to.
Had dinner with @siracusa and @dmoren and failed to capture photographic evidence. So you'll just have to trust me.
@bruinrob11 where do you work now?!!?!
@bruinrob11 yes
Assignment I would not want: Write the hit songs for Frozen 2.
Anyone know how the Breaking Bad creator feels about people tossing pizzas on the roof of Walter's house? First 90 headlines were ambiguous.
@CBSNews you tweeted that yesterday
@drwave @siracusa And I unintentionally proved recently that the alarm system works great.
@drwave @siracusa I hear you. I don't talk about it in advance, and then only when the house is still occupied.
@ChampionOfRann we'll call it 
@siracusa @drwave also, these podcast ads aren't going to sell them damn selves ;-)
@drwave recently about six to ten trips per year.
"We won't offer beverage service today, because we expect moderate to severe turbulence for the duration"

They expected right
@macfixer warby footers
@PhilthePill @dylandavid276 ugh that guy
@FlyEaglesNation @1cor_ big is beautiful
They should rename it the Lexit row. 
Though I did tell her that Daniel sounds extremely handsome.
500-year-old woman waves maniacally at me during my TSA patdown. She approaches: Is your name Daniel? 

I had to disappoint her.
@mattalexand @RynTheHuman boy. You are dangerous as you binge listen through the YDL archives!
@lexfri you assume correctly
Your Weekly Lex 
I assume there is a cat adoption agency somewhere called It’s Meow Or Never
@DKatri I think he gave away too many picks with the QB trade. I understand the $ behind dropping McCoy and Maclin.
@julianvelard @queuebit Right!

Can’t wait to see Wilt Chamberlain, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Wayne Gretzky lead the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl next season.
If Marvin Gaye just won, does Bruno Mars go directly to jail for ripping off Sting and Michael Jackson on and on and on?
@dmoren @ronoffringa @reboundcast @Moltz You can email rebound at lexfriedman dot com if you want! I’ll fwd to the other two guys.
RIP Nick Foles.
@jeffullrich How’d it go?
@dmoren No, I like it. I just can’t believe it.
@mattalexand Matt, come visit with me at SXSW
@mattalexand Matt can we meet
@mattalexand Matt
@dmoren I have a similarly difficult time believing that the first one happened.
@nateboateng I noticed ;)
No one else reporting this? RT @SportsNation: Chip Kelly releases Nick Foles and signs Dennis Dixon to a max contract 
@moiseschiu @faitherina The part I was born to play
This week’s Rebound covers everything from the Apple event. Even the Research Kit stuff. You’re welcome. 
@faitherina I have it on good authority that Lex Friedman will be here: 
@jasoneccles @caseyliss @dmoren Haven’t seen it.
Happy birthday @markosavic! <SHORTCAKE>
@caseyliss @GlennF I miss us, Casey.
@caseyliss @GlennF I take it you also appreciate what a good joke that was
@caseyliss @GlennF important question: Do you have The Sims installed?
@eibcb That’s what I tell myself each morning don’t send this tweet
@eibcb 190-something
@tapbot_paul tweetbot
@caseyliss Nope, you nailed it

see what I did there
@caseyliss I have no corrections to this tweet.
@caseyliss you forgot the comma for direct address between “ffs” and “Alexander”
@caseyliss *but a great photo
@caseyliss *me
@Moltz That’s find for Tiny
@Moltz I think you meant 
TIL I have big wrists.
Today’s iOS update fixed my iPad’s Wi-Fi connection problem. Canceled my Genius Bar appointment.
.@TheAtlantic did he ban them from calling the governor an asshole?
@pbur @_DavidSmith ew

do you clean the watches when you’re done at least

i mean, germs, guys
@viticci SERIOUS QUESTION: Did you notice any wrist hair snagging? My biggest fear. I’m a simple man.
@markosavic Come visit, buy here
They got rid of iPhoto because they wanted to launch a fanless laptop.
The case sizing doohickey in the Apple Store app is helpful. I’m leaning 38mm. Leaning.
Killer start to your email that arrived the instant the keynote ended, Tim Gray: 
@DanFrakes you owe me a lot of money / watches
@DanFrakes you lost that bet
@chockenberry that’s what she said
We know some of you get annoyed when we show a lot of videos.

In fact, we made a video about that.
I don’t know if I want 38mm or 42mm and it’s very emotionally draining
"As we mentioned last time, pricing starts at $359,000.”
Use punctuation, dude
Siri is always listening on the Apple Watch, eh? I wonder what that does for battery life. Also, for shouting HEY SIRI in a room of nerds.
Is he gonna do the Bono/ET finger touch thing with her?
@marcoarment on the bus
I’m sending @Moltz my heartbeat right now: <SPARKLING HEART> 
<SPARKLING HEART> 
<SPARKLING HEART> 
<SPARKLING HEART>

@mattbraun I would give a standing ovation

even tho I want that watch
“In fact, I’ve been feeling Bob Mansfield’s heartbeat on my wrist this entire time.”
@Moltz @blurb @dmoren shit
Don’t tell me what to hashtag, Phil
This new MacBook is cool. I don’t want one.
@dan_ness simultaneously?
You can’t connect it to an external display and power at the same time? Or you need a separate hub doohickey to do that?
All day battery life limited to planet Mercury
@panzer no, I like it
Here is my face as I learn about fancier typing keyboard technology: :|
Count me in the camp of people who don’t care how thin their light laptops are. Light is good; thin, whatever.
shill filler
I would say Apple has successfully doubled down on secrecy.
@DanFrakes SPOILERS
that is a really  big watch
@Moltz for people who follow both of us, it’s important to note that this is a UHF reference, and I am not a bad person
@Moltz How many times have I told you, never call chicks broads
Cool that Andy Richter got to be in this video
If this doesn’t work right, I call it Gaitgate
Ugh, the live room is like two minutes ahead of the livestream. This is why we need net neutrality.
DM@tim_cook No, I think you’re doing great so far; don’t sweat it. Just a subdued room.
MENTION @VITICCI, @TIM_COOK

@JebReed my second biggest Tastemade disappointment ever

(first is that @realoren never did a deal with me)
@JebReed Did I miss it?!
@rgriff the vet told us to do three meals a day until around 6 months. (It’s one third of his breakfast allotment.)
@DanFrakes Has @Frakes Landed Yet
@pbur @BodyofBreen I’ve met both of you. What do I win?
1. Feed dog lunch.

2. Dog brings empty bowl to me, saying, effectively, WTF, bro?

3. Inform dog lunch is over.

4. FEEL DRUNK WITH POWER.

“That Ronson/Mars track is really good. I guess I’m gonna call it a career.” — a dragon, apparently
.@PhilipMichaels "We're going to leave Phil Schiller's heartbeat up on the screen behind us. Notice how fast it beats as we talk pricing."
Here's our gold watch for thousands of dollars. You and your wealthy friends can send your heartbeat to each other during board meetings.
I, for one, will be okay with it if they don't mention the heartbeat sharing stuff at all today.
And my very good friend @pschiller loves "accidentally" saying Apple Crotch. He's hilarious.
@markosavic @kylesethgray you have no proof that's me
Just watched @tim_cook's final rehearsal for today. He only said "iWatch" once, so we should be good!
@AGoldmund but remember, those were shakily extrapolated numbers. Podcast measurement metrics are a lot less imprecise.
@viticci you are the man. Are you and Phil best friends now?
@blankbaby @Random_Trek GREAT GUESTS THOUGH
@JoshMalina you take that back
I try not to tweet about the Eagles here now (that’s what @LexFreagles is for), but damn, the Eagles are crazy.
@kylesethgray sorry, speling
@kylesethgray british spelling
TWO exciting updates to the story of my iPad that couldn’t see Wi-Fi networks. 
@DanFrakes mazel tov! Mine lasted ten years: 
I could do without the people telling my daughter that they're not buying Girl Scout cookies because they don't want to get "fatter."
"I like the peanut butter ones."

"Oh, there's two kinds of peanut butter, so you'll have to buy two!"
She's following in my footsteps. 

"Not today, I only have ten dollars"

"Oh that's perfect! You can buy two boxes!!" 
@joelmmathis I don’t know why I can’t send this tweet to you. It keeps filtering out before I can send. Anyway, my answer: 4:23am tomorrow
@joelmmathis
I can't reset my iPad because it can't get online

RIP Allegiance. Thanks, NBC, for clearing up my DVR a little bit.
@jsnell I got you @SlackHQ you’re supposed to love me for at LEAST a week
Podcasting wins ears of advertisers: 

But that’s if you trust that weird Friedman guy they talked to
@laurenlapkus the toast is coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE
@cradock Burnett.
Filled with regret as I realize the missed opportunity yesterday when we had to tell the kids they could finish watching Annie tomorrow.
@Ianmurren @dwiskus @gruber I’d rather Daring Fireball devote itself exclusively to Blackberry and Bond than see “iPAD.” To each their own!
@chockenberry perfect
@gruber I love you, but I think maybe we need to reconsider the all caps here just for “IPAD”’s benefit. 
@mathowie @SlackHQ !!!!
Hey, they closed school again for tomorrow. What a country.
@markosavic @imyke @caseyliss new avatar alert!

@StephenWilson It’s a brunch event and live podcast at The Market on Colorado Street on Sunday, March 15th 11am-12:30pm.
Want Horatio Sanz, Lauren Lapkus, Kevin Pollak, or the Sklar Brothers to read your ads on their podcasts? Let me know! Snow day deals! <SNOWFLAKE>️
@StephenWilson Mine! :)

@marcoarment Just recorded a @reboundcast where I suggested the gold watch will be ~$5k. THEN read your blog post. HASHTAG: GREAT MINDS

@geneweingarten the kids don’t do so well. But my kids thoroughly enjoyed the performance.
@caseyliss yeah, but you did this to yourself. #<DOG FACE>

Why yes, I do enjoy when Liam sings along to Uptown Funk. 
@RobBlatt @tmbg @DWredpantsband WE ARE ALL BFF’S
@RobBlatt WHICH ONE?!

you glad I didn't start this tweet with Apple
@RoderickOn @foremostedition @mattalexand 
@PlanetofFinks Wow. That is awesome. 

Let me know if I can connect you with 200+ more shows :)
@geneweingarten It’s just a weirdly not-proofread tweet. He didn’t mean to start with the random word prefix “Apple.”

I don’t think.
@geneweingarten 
Banana

Maybe @tim_cook just knows it’s “Start Your Tweet With A Fruit Day.”
@markosavic Apple

Sorry
the thing is, Timmy (@tim_cook) and I go way back, and he loves a good joke at his expense.
I assume all the people making jokes about @tim_cook’s weird tweet who don’t tag him are worried that Tim will be mad at them. But—
@tim_cook Apple

Okay
It is some real baloney that it’s not lunch time yet.

Mmmm, baloney.
@mattalexand This one, right? Not the one immediately prior.
I want Gmail’s “forgot attachment” plug-in for “forgot to CC the person you said you were CC’ing.”

@dlpasco @jsnell @siracusa @dmoren Oh, I have. (Which I hate; I want my screen dark darn it.) But I still long for sun’s warm embrace.
@dlpasco @jsnell @siracusa @dmoren Indeed. Night mode is no friend to me.
@hugel Briefly! Spending about 20 hours there to speak on one panel.
@goinglike60 @Stitcher Me too!
From the picture, I assume that these dog poop bags are also good for your domesticated lions. 
@lexfri @flargh this tweet was perhaps underappreciated, but I honestly think it's my finest work.
@flargh well, when in Roam.
Only one of my kids is currently screaming and crying because another ate all of an imaginary cake.
@tomcuthbert @ZipRecruiter But I love that guy!
Mr. Rogers's message to his fans who grew up watching his show. <THUMBS UP SIGN> 
@OrvilleIV me too!
The Modern Family FaceTime/iMessage episode was good. But where was the documentary crew that whole time? Week off?

@jmilbery VERY good question.

It must be interesting to know before you die what so many headlines / obituaries will say.
The One With The Police 
(All proceeds from both shirts go towards a scholarship fund in memory of Harris.)
Couldn’t buy Earwolf’s Harris memorial shirt because of the word “motherBLEEPer” and the fact that my kids read. So: 
Got the all clear. Reclaimed Cody. Best guess is someone failed to lock the front door properly. Suspect pictured. 
There was a b&amp;e on our block in the past week. So they're checking it out. 

Cody freaked out.
Went to see my kid's birthday celebration at school. Alarm company called to say the front door was open. I locked it when I left.
I get to wait outside. The alarm went off while I was out. Front door wide open. Good times. 
It has been zero days since police were in my house with guns drawn.

Everything's fine. Probably.
Mr. @dmoren’s opening salvo on this week’s @reboundcast truly surprised me. 
It’s a lot easier to see the colors of the dress in this photo: 
@davemurdock Haven’t written much up I’m afraid… And I’m a little fuzzy on the details. Been a few years since they went up!
@marinaepelman In the winter :) A little less sun, but a lot less A/C… It all works out.
Your tweets about how we should only think about more important things and not enjoy hours of dress/llama frivolity: <THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Solar panels. 
It’s black and blue now. Glad I stayed up late.
The dress is half empty.
@mathowie @MaxTemkin @PJVogt @nicolehe this is maddening. Team gold and white.
@geneweingarten you are as talented as you are handsome.
A good fourth birthday. 
@sfsooz @JonPhillipsSFIt was really a comment on “Apple used to invite certain people. Who those people are had to change multiple times.”
@sfsooz @JonPhillipsSF I still subscribe to Macworld in my RSS feed. I listen to the podcast every week.
I’m guessing Apple sends its event invites to whoeversstillthere@macworld.com
@jsnell Hahaha
I really liked Birdman. Sorry, @jsnell.
@caseyliss @marcoarment Can I sell THAT one?!
I spend lots of time worrying about what exactly she means when she sings “I give you bass,” since my kids sing it. I don’t think it’s good.
@AppleWorldToday Source?
@adamspelbring Just 16 to go!
@adamspelbring not in this case… my tread usage hasn’t changed at all (except perhaps to decrease); this was a diet-focused shift
Sometimes, I iMessage with @imyke: 
I lost 18 pounds since November 2014 with this one trick! 

(eating less)
Yesterday, the eight-year-old suddenly stopped fearing and started loving the dog. Good times.
@PhilipMichaels where is anything?! My navigation skills are nonexistent.
Birthday tradition. 
@PhilipMichaels I am not saying it's a bad show. I am merely saying I would be terrible on it.
Probably my favorite song about people who be jammin’ is Jammin’.
@replyall Early!
I’m watching The Amazing Race for the first time in my life. I would rather get kicked in the crotch 10 straight times than go on this show.
@MaxTemkin but I already did! You want I should subscribe twice?
@dmoren @jessiechar my phantom smell is burning plastic. It often precedes migraines.
@GlennF call your doctor if huge pangs continue for more than three hours
@dmoren now you’re just trawling me
@MatthewPerry I think you’re great on it. Not a huge fan of the laugh track. Can you pull a Sports Night and get it quieted to silence?
@pbyrne it is literally the most offensive laugh track I’ve ever heard. Including MASH and Sports Night.
The laugh track on Matthew Perry’s The Odd Couple fills me with rage.
Sometimes, everybody tweets the same thing at the same time. 


@jsnell Insanely frustrating.
@StuFFmc If you want way too long: 
@caseyliss oh. Notification Center broke this joke.
@caseyliss I have news for you about how babies work
One of my top iOS feature requests is "read status" syncing for Continuity based text messages.
@caseyliss adopting a small puppy hasn't fucked with our sleep schedule to this extent, but it hasn't helped.

@KarlMorand Thanks! We’re on it.
@jkottke you’re half right
@GlennF My questions:

Is MAC good?

Can Mac run .exe’s?

Why Mac?

iMac?

My Mac is slow. Fix it?

Should I buy a Mac?

Is my Mac bi?
@agentkyle THANKS!
We (@midroll) put together this white paper on the surprising secrets of successful podcasters. It’s kind of awesome. 
@chartier This I have no objection to.
@flargh I love his song “Every Mornin’”!
@tiffanyarment Honest truth: I’m sitting here overjoyed that you started the day knowing zero rhymes for your name and now have two
@tjluoma Hey! Midroll has 200 advertisers in Q1. We’re working on it! ;)
@tiffanyarment On the other hand, not a damn thing rhymes with “Lex."
@tiffanyarment It seriously pains me that you’ve lived your whole life without knowing about these two rhymes.
@tiffanyarment Both @siracusa and @imyke nailed epiphany, but missed polyphony.
@tjluoma I just remembered your line of work. I mean I hate that darn ol’ button
@tjluoma @brentsimmons I hate that goddamn button
“HEY! Congrats on the new computer!!! I have NEVER SEEN this Mac before!!!!!”

Impressed by the linguistic acrobatics on display at dog chew websites when they artfully avoid explaining exactly what a bully stick is.
@siracusa @settern I’m not. I like the game, except for its night view, where I can’t see squat.
@BenRiceM what is going on
@BenRiceM who the hell is this
@BenRiceM You’re supposed to get prior written approval from me before you change your goddamn avatar

@mtabini Happy birthday to one of the Internet’s most beloved Marcos!

If you flip the syllables of Birdman, mispronounce “bird,” and change “man” to “boy,” you get my favorite film of the year.
Totally worth it, NPH.
Happy Monday, east coast!
She said “Lex”; I win.
would be funny if she forgot her speech
Matthew McConaughey has never looked better
“We’re thinking of taking another commercial break right now. Whether we will or not will be decided by whatever’s in NPH’s box.”
“It’s 11:48pm on the east coast; I’m going to just open this goddamn envelope.”
And the Oscar goes to… 

We’ll find out right after this word from our sponsors.
@YevP sponsors gonna spons
THE OSCAR FOR SHITTIEST PACING OF AN AWARDS SHOW GOES TO YOU, YOU ASSHOLES
YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY BE TAKING ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BREAK
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Up next, one award, then six more ads, then another award!
@siracusa I did it better
This commercial break is the worst thing that ever happened.
When Oprah reads your category, all nominees get a car
(Thunderous applause)
“Folks, we’re running pretty long, so we’re just going to announce the winners for the remaining awards.”

I mean, that was nice, but it was no Everything Is Awesome.
It’s been years of award shows using these microphones, and still no one tells the world’s biggest stars that they don’t have to bend down.
I hope this year’s Emmy In Memoriam segment includes whoever thought up this one for the Oscars
If I decided whether to buy Apple devices based on modern Apple commercials, I would never buy any Apple devices.
@JamieDass So proud!
@stevensande agreed
@franktisellano deal
@agiletortoise sold
If I ever win an Oscar with any of you, let’s just agree now that I’m the one who gets to talk.
JUST finished booing Shirley Maclaine, by the way.
Sometimes I think that if I were an advertising creative, I’d have no idea how to market soda. 

I see Diet Coke has the same problem.
Gwyneth Paltrow’s dress nearly absorbed the twin it was in the womb with
@markosavic It’s not TV, it’s not HBO… It’s @lexfri
Fun fact: Andy Samberg wasn’t available for Everything Is Awesome tonight; that was Adele Nazim in costume.
They should just start the playoff music as soon as the non-famous accepters start talking.
Wait, they still let Travolta attend?
And this is the first time I’ve seen an Oscar-winning short film! So proud. I’d like to thank the little people.
If nothing else, Twitter taught me this: The live performance of Everything Is Awesome was rather polarizing.
That was … something.
@JoshMalina You didn’t like Boyhood?!
I join all people of intelligence in loudly booing Shirley Maclaine.
Instant idea to make the Oscars WAY more exciting:

If you don’t get to the stage in 20 seconds, 2nd place gets your award.
I can spell half of these actors’ names.
@ActuallyNPH So, @JoshMalina says you have to stop laughing at your own jokes.
The Academy Award for slowest ascension to the stage goes to this costume designer.
@cnnbrk You guys are ON it.
Walk slower, lady.
Somebody lugged that stand out to its mark JUST FOR YOU.
If you’re just gonna take the mic out, why make them give you a mic stand? Rock stars are jerks.
Just remembered you can’t fast forward live television.
I’ve seen 100% of the films that have won Oscars so far tonight.
Honestly, even BEFORE the opener, if I had to name 2 additional potential H’wood best friends, Kendrick and Black would’ve been contenders.
There is no one in Hollywood I’d rather be best friends with than NPH.
I don't know who’s gonna WIN tonight, but I can tell you who’s gonna lose: America.
The Oscars don’t start for another half-hour? I demand a recount.
Million dollar business idea: Multicolored Parmesan cheese and you call it Spaghetti Confetti.
The sickest thing about this winter is how 38° days feel warm.

Uptown funk just gave me a whole bunch of crap. What am I supposed to do with all of this?

The vet needs a stool sample. They close at noon. Cody pooped at 12:14.
@GlennF well, I guess it depends on what you're wearing.
@GlennF "he appears!" That's not obscene.
@barkbox Cody likes his new toy. Thanks! 
@julianvelard I didn't listen yet! But I will, I promise!
@infopal to be fair, though, it's ALWAYS sad to end up in Newark.
On this week’s @reboundcast, @dmoren and @Moltz are wrong about the Apple Car, and I am right. 


@dmoren @reboundcast @Moltz And also massage chairs.

@marcoarment @AmyJane I'm so sorry
@AmyJane hey, I'll be in Manhattan today, too! If you see me, say hi.
This is probably the most thorough evisceration of Rudy Giuliani you’ll read today. 
@cabel The Friedman family's thoughts are with you at this difficult time.
Two important Cody updates:

1. He had his first bath. 

2. He is no longer speaking to me.

I'm so tired I could sleep with a horse.
@GlennF For some reason it was behind this old toilet
@GlennF I JUST found a copy of God’s Third Testament
@drwave @normmacdonald This is why they make chocolate and vanilla
So, @normmacdonald’s essay on Eddie Murphy and SNL40 is awesome and worth reading but holy Moses that’s a painful way to use Twitter

@jsnell I have a puppy.
@cjbannon @ProducerMcD @Midroll it's like riding a bicycle. (With microphones attached.)

@GlennF I have no recollection of this.
@AppStore Is that the Law &amp; Order font?
@DanFrakes For me, it happens whenever I leave Affiliatizer turned on, and works when I turn it off. IT WAS A GOOD GUESS
@jeffcarlson @DanFrakes i'm guessing that's because you also use my Safari extension for Amazon.
@DanFrakes that's because you use my Amazon extension.
@BodyofBreen you meant "workin for Beats ['s corporate parent]"

@MaxTemkin @SlackHQ this is an excellent question.
@MacSparky @jsnell Breakfast with Snell would also make a great name for your memoir.
@Moltz look at this guy
At Newark airport, some drivers get the best parking spots there are – along with free charging. 
I hope Paul Simon covers Party In the USA
Lovitz callback funniest joke of the night.
Louis hilarious in 45 seconds.
"Let Jerry make an inappropriate joke about Seinfeld and race relations, and to balance it, let Kanye do whatever he wants for 10 minutes."
Someone is giving Lorne terrible advice on what the kids today like.
What the hell
We still quote "That bird is a liar" here in the Friedman residence.
I figured it out, you guys. Eddie Murphy is an Andy Kaufman character.
"Slip out the back, Jack" — what Paul Simon almost certainly just did
So weird to be watching SNL live
@GlennF story of my LIFE
If my life's biggest regret is the fact that I never got on SNL, then that sucks, because goddamit why did I not get onto SNL
If you bleep Bill Murray you are an asshole.
Opera Man!
Martin Short doesn't age. He is the anti GE Smith.
Incredible to see what sketches Lorne thinks deserve live placement in the 40th. I'm in the small group that likes Californians, but still…
When will Leonardo DiCaprio play Jack Nicholson?
Keith Richards looks like GE Smith
GE Smith looks exactly like Zombie GE Smith
Holy crap GE Smith looks 500.
Oh my god they forgot to invite Melanie Hutsell
@GlennF the fourth
@GlennF care to make it interesting?
I would love to see SNL parody the hilariously awkward celebrity interviews from the SNL Red Carpet special
@snowcones It actually means more nights in Houston
@markosavic after 

which is so much worse
VERY excited.
Can’t begin to express how excited I am for this week’s business travel to get screwed up beyond measure by the weather.
@cabel Told him wha—

Holy shit.
Honestly, sometimes I think we should require that sleeping dogs tell the truth instead.
@joelmmathis perfect time to get a new dog that needs 12 trips outside per day!
@markosavic that is some bullshit.
Other peoples weather is incredibly boring, but obscenely high winds here blowing the snow all over the place are insane.
@creativecody you are nearly as cute as your namesake dog
Seems obscenely unlikely that I would end up with the cutest dog in the world, but here we are. I should play the lottery!
This is my Instagram now. 
Some people want to know whether Cody is cute. I submit this evidence. 
Cody's home!

@GlennF I always think, “I wouldn’t really call it ‘living’ at that apartment…”
@JacobEthanWhite I think we have now overthought this exactly the right amount.
@JacobEthanWhite We should overthink this together.

I was thinking the tissues do the blowing, the nose gets blown. Not quite right.
We used to be productive at work. Then we discovered /giphy.
@markosavic I took my car into the shop. The mechanic told me I’d blown a seal. I said fix the car and leave my private life out of this.

Where is my detachable nose wet/dry vacuum, “science”? It’s 2015 for sneezing out loud.

In retrospect, I don't know why I was so surprised that Tom Petty didn't back down.
@barelyknown Not their hardware
@barelyknown Okay, so I’m talking about the new Dish TV subscription service for getting various channels at $20/mo
@barelyknown I don’t see any reference to such features. Where?
@barelyknown “Some channels allow for on-demand playback of shows for up to three days” — feels unnecessarily tight
@nwquah “Some channels allow for on-demand playback of shows for up to three days.”

Not good enough for my slow-watching self
If Sling TV offered any kind of time-shifting, I’d sign up today. It’s 2015, dudes. I don’t want to care what “time” a show is on.

He speaks really good English, and I’m having a great time, and I’ve lied twice in this tweet.
THEY PICKED UP!
All three use different music. All three hate me.
Now I’m on hold on three lines:

General support
Premiere support
Israel support
Now I’m on hold on two different lines! This is fun. The music clashes, though.
Hey, thanks for not muting me. (Yet.)
I can’t say, for example, “let’s look at Thursday, you miserable pricks,” because there is no such button.
So it insists that I click on one of the zero flights available before proceeding to the next step.
United’s website will let me choose an alternate flight, but only for today, Tues, or Wed. And there are 0 flights available on those days.
@cabel I got that United message a couple days ago, AND I was logged in! “Accurate error messages are also unavailable.”
I have been on hold for one hour and ten minutes.

It’s true! I’m the guest on this week’s episode of @arsachs’s The Wolf Den. Great talk on the business of podcasting. 
@danprovost @mathowie @marcoarment and/or @tjluoma
Hello jet lag, you old incorrigible whore.
@abrahamvegh yeah
Shalom from Tel Aviv.

@einmaleins that's disgusting 

Oh you meant the phone
Battery: 96% full
Bladder: 0% full
At Newark. I have to pee, but it means giving up this premium airport charging station. Weighing my options.
@jamesthomson Lex Friedman
@markosavic you're welcome
@geneweingarten I fealty request you are making is unreasonable
This week's @podcaststartup is really good, and will ring true to anyone who's worked at a startup.
@BenRiceM one soul crushing omission
Thanks, @iTunesPodcasts! Alongside some other great parenting shows. @ttcashow 
How many calories in one packet of silica gel?
My @coin beta delivery slipped from “November” to “soon” to “before the earth crashes into the sun,” as far as I can tell.

Wow.

Now I’m softly singing Unchained Melody.
@caseyliss @ismh thanks for the chain link, guys

nailed it
Boo.
We called the fake here in central New Jersey.
The Green Bay Packers are having a day.
@Moltz mmm, butterball
I’m rooting for Green Bay but the past minute following their revenge-terception was embarrassing. Unsportsmanlike followed by not snapping.
Watching the football game. Three-year-old Liam recognizes it’s cut to commercial.

“Stupid ads!” he exclaims.

No one tell him what I do.
Experiencing a first: Hulu video playing fine, ads stuttering terribly.
.@Andiznit eh, well... I'm okay.
@Andiznit I HATE that guy!
@tiffanyarment read this as mortgage. Only slightly less confused on rereading.
@markosavic I hate that fucking guy
@samuelcole I had no idea that everyone saw the same levels. I thought they were algorithmically generated at runtime.
I got six consecutive holes in one, and then Desert Golfing decided to be a prick. 
@tennabey yes! Sister and her family
@ampsonic @reboundcast @ttcashow you don't wanna know
@cabel isweting is Hebrew for is waiting
@cabel my friend Jack isweting me at the airport. "HI JACK!" I intend to yell over and over
Found my shirt for next week's fight to Israel! 
My kids' bowel movements are seemingly triggered by the phrase "go get dressed." #tmisaturday
@dermdaly !
@markosavic EWR next!
@antichrista Can’t be. You’re funny!
@MaxTemkin happy birthday!
@ProducerMcD preach
@caseyliss perfect.
@caseyliss you sexy beast
@caseylisscom you tease
@barenakedladies sincere best wishes to Kevin
This episode of @ttcashow is called Vomit Jellybeans so you know it's good 
@antichrista infuriating
@JoshMalina Sorry, bro. You’re stuck with me another year. Enjoy Shabbat Birthday! 
I think my computer supports my township’s property tax website. 
@ronoffringa @Khaoszr @thetalkshow @reboundcast @atpfm @JustTheTip You have excellent taste.
@jamesthomson GENIUS
Death Becomes Me 
@sethclifford you’re welcome
I guess the Lego Movie is a brick and it’s drowning slowly
@shepgo I use it with Reeder on iOS and Fluid on the Mac.
@shepgo still using it, and still loving it. Feedbin works exactly the way my brain does.
The Goldbergs is a really impressively good show.
@neededition @mattalexand I just wish somebody could teach me how to use the safety razor
@atpfm So excited to guest star on this one!
@mollylauf You know, they are looking for a season two advertiser… *whistles innocently*
@hotdogsladies I need to know whether my podcast's theme song counts. This is important.
@Mom101 my daughter Anya is "on you". Every time.
@chockenberry one of my most used apps!
Also I bet Siri can successfully transcribe Zooey Deschanel.
I bet Zooey Deschanel does a really good Pee-wee Herman impression.
No, but I think we can all agree it SHOULD be. 
Arrive at coffeehouse / meeting place 20 minutes early, planning to sneak in some work. Get greeted by NO LAPTOPS sign. Tweet. (From phone.)
@DaniellaKrieger cool!
Never too early to be in Manhattan, that's what I always say. 

Minutes before I get murdered.
@dwiskus @YevP @moiseschiu I literally wrote the book on sex.*

* With Snuggies.
@YevP @moiseschiu @dwiskus I’m great in bed.
@YevP I hear you! I miss us.
@YevP Hi! We should figure out Q1 stuff soon, you know? You miss me, don’t you? :D
“Buy one size smaller than you need,” said every Amazon reviewer to the guy who’s sending back his new jacket for the size he needs.
@schollem That was @abbiperets! Nice.
@brianstucki @Imaginedragons Wow. Congrats!
@geneweingarten I sincerely doubt that schmuck’ll be elected.
@viticci @ismh Dammit.
@ismh But… Is he?
The Athlete 
Nailed it.
Romney says he has to run again because of “a strong sense of duty,” which to me offers whiffs of the “strong scents of doody.”
@flargh @iMore That’s one option, guys. Jesus is another.
@SPeitsch @siracusa Of course!
I’m married to several people, which I think is pretty big o’ me.
@dmoren Mine does. But Alexander, hooboy. That guy’s a douche.
@jsnell @siracusa That’s enough for both of us.
@jsnell @siracusa I have seen literally every episode of Full House.
@siracusa I think I’m mostly flummoxed. But not offended. I don’t see it, but I’m okay with it.
Watching your kids learn to read is awesome. 
@MaxTemkin @moiseschiu can vouch, dude hasn't left my bed since that tweet happened
@foremostedition sup?
@foremostedition hi
Scored some pretty great address labels from St. Jude's. 
@NissanSupport And now you have!
@zennioptical @kerri9494 I placed an order on Kerri’s recommendation! BooM!
@NissanSupport Followed! Can you follow back?
@capttaco @brentsimmons agreed, but top preference would be: rephrase
@hhwong @NissanLEAF @NissanUSA I’m driving a 2015 Leaf. I’m disappointed with its cold-weather performance but love it overall.
@hhwong @NissanLEAF Oof. How many total?
@BenRiceM @dmoren Yes and no… USAA doesn’t care as much WHAT I say as much as how I say it. And it won’t listen to me if I use silly voices.
@DanFrakes Every one I’ve over owned (not this brand) died eventually. (Even with new batteries.)

Keep me posted on this one’s performance!
@dmoren Yeah, that. Sorry. Siri.
@dmoren thank heavens no audio recording of my voice exists anywhere
@dmoren I like into USAA with my voice, and I have fun every time.
@pbur You’re right. Very sorry to hear the news.
@OptimumHelp I’m a loyal, longtime customer. I have neighbors who got gifted 101 for years at no charge. 

Will sucking up help?
@OptimumHelp Rep told me to go from Ultra 50 (which I’m on) to Ultra 101 costs an extra $55/month. Can that possibly be right?
@JoshMalina On your birthday this year actually
@viticci Rock. On.
Crazy Good Wife disclaimers tonight.
If that was Prince trying his hardest...
@JoshMalina I've read this aloud to several people and literally lol'd each time. 

I get yiu.
@alyankovic I didn't know my mother was in town!
Jerry Jones is so NOT going to send the refs their check this week.
Wow. This is a game. I miss @LexFreagles.
Refs breathing easier now.
Obvious Dallas turnovers must be really emotionally trying for these referees.
@ironicsans loved frogger, love Crossy Road fwiw.
It's helpful that Dallas can remind the refs to throw bogus flags.
