Hmm what to do, series or gaming?
I got to see him yesterday and it was okay, but still I don't rlly like being around him :/ got annoyed
He knows I've got a bf, but still tells me he likes me
There's this dude who wants to see me all the time and he likes me, but I don't and idk how to get rid of him -__- he's being too nice
I used a face massage to slim my face more, it helped a bit
@SkiesAbove1 finished!!  Now just have to wait for the results,  I think it went pretty good^^ hows ur work
@SkiesAbove1 hahah so are you xd
A positive tweet a day, keeps the negative away.
Ok bye x
Im cute
@SkiesAbove1 same xoxox
@SkiesAbove1 That's true :) but no treat daily hehe that won't help me
@SkiesAbove1 before I was able to eat anything and it made me happy, but now I gain easily &gt;_&gt;
@SkiesAbove1 I've already eaten a bit more healthy this week, also less eating, but eating does not make me happy as it used to :( meh
@SkiesAbove1 I just want the perfect healthy weight, even if I don't see much difference on the outside D:
@SkiesAbove1 ThaaanK YOU &lt;33 :DDD
Today my last exam
THIS  
Everyone is pretty in their own way.
I don't want to feel jealous towards you, cause that means I'll dislike you and I just want to be nice to you and not dislike..stupid feelin
Whenever I gain weight you can abrely se it, but when I step up the scale it says something different lol
I've gained weight thanks to the pill.. so now I'm using pills to lose that weight.. I lost 2 kg in a week
Ahh coffee &lt;3
My throat is feeling weird
@getinspiredshit it does
Sometimes I get to feel jealous, but I don't want to admit.. or I just don't know why I do
Hi cute xx 
Bought anothet cute top too ^^ getting ready for summer
On me*
I used to feel uncomfy in a dress and never wear them, but I found a rlly cute one and it looks cute one tbh, so Yay 
@SkiesAbove1 @AgainstSuicide @ancient_civil @wynnes2608 @CometHarbour so do you&lt;333
Like my page pls 
Don't stress over things that don't matter.
Don't worry about thinks you can't…
Exams going well :)
Good to let go the negative
Love yourself.
Keep smiling <WHITE SMILING FACE> #positivetweets
I am beautiful and loved. #PositiveTweets
Time for a positive attitude towards myself.
@grungexgirl1 aw thabk you so much;__&lt;33 so are u
Miss you :(((
Goodnight &lt;3
@grungexgirl1 that's true.. He wants to be with me all the time though But I just feel boring towards him sometimes, stupid insecurities..
Let them go away pls
Stupid thoughts <THOUGHT BALLOON>
I just feel like it's not good enough always
No mattrr how many times he has told me I'm the best thing he ever had and I'm perfect.. It's hard to believe cuz I get insecure often
Stupid insecurities only has brought me trouble so far. For myself at least
Is it normal to be jealous of ur boyfriend's friends cz u insecure about urself and that he might've more fun with them and I'm boring maybe
Idk if I lost you, but we never meet up
It sucks when you lose good friends, but I got something better in return
You're my everything *-*
Went to paganfest with my b&lt;333 
I want to be better than ever
I love u so much xx
Had an amazing weekend :)!!!!!!
Happy Friday everyone!!!
@UnbreakableIzMe You're not!
@UnbreakableIzMe why not:(
Friday please!!!&lt;333 boo pls
On my way home :)
@hopeless_23 Day*
Today I started off my dat very positive and I noticed from that only good things can happen :) it really makes a difference. It does.
This day was epic in other words!!!
@UnbreakableIzMe Awwwe thanku^__^
@UnbreakableIzMe Nooo, dont forget it! Smile now :D
Guess a positive mindset is nore than important ^___^
Had a really good day!!! FUN
As long as you are happy, that's what matters. Stop worrying about everything else.
Don't forget to smile today <CAT FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Don't think too much
Stay positive!
Choose happiness today!
I should really stop overthinking.
U g…
@SkiesAbove1 omg Thank youuu :DD
Cutie
My happiness :D
Having a great weekend with my bf <BLACK HEART SUIT><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> Love you more than anything ever <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> <BLACK HEART SUIT>
@UnbreakableIzMe True :) sometimes I feel perfect the way I want it and sometimes not
@UnbreakableIzMe they're gone xD sorry
Just found the perfect outfit for spring
At least I have a self-esteem now, unlike a few years ago lol
I've kinda accepted my appearance by now, but still I don't feel perfect the way I want. I need to be more happy with myself.
Eating marshmallows
@SkiesAbove1 Thaaaanks!! I have :) Same to u dear!xxxxx
I don't rlly like summer tbh, I like wearing lots of clothes to hide -shy
Shopping
My hair is so messy now -_-
I don't wanna know what happened if I didn't have you
Bad habit
I always seem to forget to smile :/
We only ever want more and better
In the train
- Every day.
- To everyone.
The difference is in how people deal with it.
My plan for today was to go shopping in the other city but I need to hurry if I want.
Just woke up.. Woah late
I shouldn't compare myself to anyone at all.
The more I compare myself the les satisfied I am and more unhappy.

anxiety: im glad you asked.
Get ur hot buns over here bby xxx
Ok DONE,<OK HAND SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
I will overcome this.
I'm better than I think.
I can do this.
I'm cute and funny.
I am sweet, awesome and amazing.
I am more than good enough.
I AM GOOD ENOUGH.
Lemme help myself out
Rlly hate it, I don't want it
I've had this jealousy before with a friend.. It caused me trouble and almost ended the friendship like wow -_-
The only way to overcome this is by working on myself
I should listen to you..
I get these feelings caused by my own insecurity...
I shouldn't feel like someone else is better than me. That's bullshit right -_-
It's different, completely normal to talk to eachother like that. It's just different.
I shouldn't worry
Even after all these times you've faced me with the truth I still get scared :/
I hate the feeling of jealousy and I just want to stop it. So pathetic -___-
Back at home!! Had a great weekend ^_^ &lt;3
Everything is perfect,  you and me <BLACK HEART SUIT>
My bae <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> <FLUSHED FACE> <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Gonna cuddle you tho heheh
Goodnight my sweet &lt;333
Don't wanna wake u up
Kinda wanna turn on the light, just to see your cute face while sleeping *_* awww
Sleeping next to you is one of the perfect things in life &lt;3
One hour left I guess
Can't wait to hold you in my arms *-*
Strange
And the moment I see you again it's gone
A feeling of tension I used to always have before we met at the start, monts ago.. More like nervous idk
I'm feeling this weird tension,  but this time it's a good one
Travelling to my bf, aka to the other side of the country lol

Xxxx
Sassy shizs
Ok <OK HAND SIGN>
Omg I'm sich a bitch heheheh

Actually there's nothing to be jealous about
I hate being jealous of someone, while you actually like them
<DROPLET><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>
There's no hot water coming from the sink-___-
Had 10hrs of sleep so that should be enough
Time to get up, and work
Pls
You're my everything &lt;333
I never thought I'd find someone
And used to feel unloved and insecure. Scared of my future. And now it's all different :)
I'm so happy how I've changed in the past year. I remember a year ago when I was struggling with anxiety and self hatred.
You made me a better person
@hopeless_23 Spent all night working on it again and it looks even better than before thabk god. Now I can sleep well bye. (2/2)

As if it couldn't get any worse.. Fight with parents ughhh shut up mtrfkr
Tomorrow's a new day.

I'm sorry my dear...
You were right... So right
I'll try harder..  Try my best
I need to stop this shit -_-
I don't wanna go down this path again ffs :@ its my past
Looks like I've been hit or something ugh

Stop worrying about the little things that don't matter, start loving and focus on the good
There are far more important things to do
Glad I can help myself so well
Don't worry too much, be happy <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Just overwrite the bad with all the good
It's all okay now
I can't relapse for one stupid little thing
I should be there to be positive... Instead I do this
I'm the one who causes problems
Im so sorry
I shouldn't expect you to be nice when i act this retarded.
This has to stop..
It's my fault. And now I act like I need attention or something.. Stupid. I'm wasting ur time.
Ugh I don't deserve someone as good as you....
Cut me
So angry at myself.... Hate hate
It's my own stupid fault omg
The person you love the most, makes you vulnerable
Thinking about cutting...  Wtf
WTF... I'm so stupid
I'm good at screwing things up...
Hate myself so much for this..
OH WELL
Ugh... Some conversations I'd rather avoid
I just love watching you sleep omg <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> <PURPLE HEART>

Still there's always room for improvement
It's better than ever now
I need a little time for myself to get things done and right, work on my personal things, refresh myself
No one is perfect
I may be perfect in your eyes, but for me I don't feel like it D: I should feel better about myself
I should try harder
I wanna be more than perfect for you
Stupid pills make me feel bad for no reason
I'm perfectly fine tbh
When everything seems perfect, you have like zero problems, your mind always finds a way to MAKE the problems -_- smh
My thighs touch and it feels weird
Hmm I have gained alot of weight lately.. I never had this before
This has to stop now
Why do I worry so much for no reason.. Rlly
Ugh... Hate this feeling

Time to work a little harder!
It's never enough, is it?
~Recovery~
Fourth step: Keep going and keep on learning.
Third step: Stay positive and motivate yourself.
Second step: Make a plan to change it.
First step: Admit you have a problem.
I gotta change this. Ffs.
I have my happy moments and I appreciate all the good things that happen, but I don't feel the daily motivation.
@SkiesAbove1 You are not!! What makes you think that omg o_o
I am not gonna relapse, never again.
Let it all out.
Maybe I should cry, just to feel again.
I just want to feel more than this.
@SkiesAbove1 Haha still? wow, hows work and stuff going now :) and exams
What to do, when you don't know what's the cause of it.
Everything is going well in reality, but I still feel empty somehow.
Like nothing is wrong, but I still don't feel really happy.
I am not even hungry.
I think about you often, I wanna call you up, text you or tweet.. but idk what to do ugh :( it's been a while.

Anyways. New day tomorrow, will be much better! Goodnight x.
I haven't talked to my bae all day... Maybe that's why I feel sad :(
A negative attitude will never give you a positive life.
Hard times are there to make you even stronger.
Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have.
Always remember: bad days doesn't mean a bad life.
Hope you read this..
Hope you're doing okay &lt;3
I wonder if you miss me..
218 d c

We tend to look at others as if they got more, have it all figured out. Truth is, we all struggle with problems.
If you have talents, use them.
You are capable of so much more than you think.
I can't do that anymore, I know it isn't right. There has to be another way to do this.
@heartbreakella Thank you&lt;3&lt;3

Damn
Kinda wanna talk to you, but I'm scared a bit..
It's all about looks.
You know what sucks, one time I put extra effort in looking pretty and I noticed I got treated waaaay nicer. And when I don't, I can tell.
Miss you :(

Sick and tired of being like this.
Why can't I be more like you?..
I HATE MYSELF.
You're so much better than me..
Worthless..
Useless..
Hate myself now
Feeling so alone
No one needs me..
Feeling like a fucking loser.
Crying..
Be happy, being sad gets you nowhere.
Be Happy.
Sometimes ppl ask what happened why I am happy. I say nothing really happened, but I have many reasons. One reason is a positive attitude.
We are all beautiful ~
No one deserves to feel that bad about themselves.
No one is a failure.
No failure.
I knew I could do it ~
Everything goes better than expected.

If most people fear, that person will most likely fear the same about you.

Accentssss
I always thought it was misspelled, until I noticed English people using 'me' just like that.
Chilling in me room
Don't think too much.
Remember, you don't have to do what everyone else is doing.
I finally found a job, but idk if I can handle the socialness that comes with it.
I am feeling control.

My old friend started talking to me again, just when I thought she hated me...

@4MeWhatever You are so much better than the bullshit you get, they do not deserve anywhere half as much as you desverve bby xx
@4MeWhatever You're welcome sweeet :) x The fighter is within you and it will come out if you keep on trying. Yes choose for yourself :)
Sometimes it really doesn't matter if I'm okay, but if you are it's all good &lt;3
Helping others makes me happy &lt;3
Hein and Sam are the best :')
He made my day &lt;3
Lolol Sam is so funny XD
Stupid bag of air.. I wanted chips ffs.
*Fighting*
Feeling alot better already..
@4MeWhatever Yes, thats exactly what they want.. but not gonna give it.. so I will wait ;)
@4MeWhatever -how many people those are, but sometimes only 1 person can be enough to be by your side and help &lt;3
@4MeWhatever Please remember that :) and I know there are more people who believe in you and will always stay true. Doesn't matter how many-
@4MeWhatever -see on the outside you are a little fighter and can get through it no matter what :) I will be here for you and I believe in u
@4MeWhatever but I wanna say I really envy you being so strong when you go through this and I can not imagine how it is for yu, but I can-
@4MeWhatever Thats sooo true omg! Yea they are not worth spending much time on :) And need to move on and forget them yes, the best u can do
Ohh how I wish you were here with me.. I would be actually happy then :(
I am gonna stay up all night and watch movies with some snacks and stuff. Imagining you are here with me-
We are stonger than we think.
Heheh.. it's something positive tho!
I am in shock o__o
This was the proof that things will get better if you just believe!
I need to stop encouraging myself -_-
I guess I fell too early
So this girl just posted something and I really didn't expect it at all :o
Woah.. just when I thought you lied to me.. the truth was revealed o_o I am in shock
I am gonna write a bit now :)
Stop Overthinking.
Everything will get better.
There aren't many people who stay by your side during the journey, but the few that actually do.. don't let them go.
@4MeWhatever Yes its unfair.. but sooner or later hopefully they will notice what they miss :) karma.
It's okay to cry every once in a while.
@4MeWhatever These days friends are easy to replace I guess -_-
@4MeWhatever Well they didnt let me down, but they got new friends and I got kinda replaced :/ aww thank you hun , u too xx
@4MeWhatever Some just act all nicely to you and the other time behind ur back they talk so much crap. It's unbelieveable right ://
@4MeWhatever That some people let me down
Not gonna sleep yet..
@SkiesAbove1 You always keep me up :') ur special
@SkiesAbove1 Thank you dearest &lt;333
@4MeWhatever Yes..in times like this you get to see who ur real friends are and who you can trust :/ and who not to trust. I am let down too
These months are gonna be real tough.
I am gonna thank myself for staying strong after tonight.
This is not the end.
@4MeWhatever but I also have bad stuff coming back again now, so I know how it feels.. we gotta keep fighting no matter what life brings
@4MeWhatever I know what you mean :( I have that too.. but trust me, it won't last forever. Things will get better someday.. but
Wish I could make you happy.
Antisocial

Loneliness kills.
