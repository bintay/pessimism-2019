My older brother graduated from Art School on Saturday. I'm sad because I keep missing all the important events in my siblings lives
Wish I could have saw my mom today or any day really. I haven't seen her in almost a year.
Bout to get up and clean before I go to work
Since I went to sleep I've been watching up every 2-3 hours. Why ? I don't know <CRYING FACE><PENSIVE FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I just worked 1230-1030. My feet hurt so bad and I got do that shit again tomorrow.
Soon as I get off go get me some Wendy's nuggets and go home. Take a shower and watch Netflix til I ko
My feet hurt so fucking bad. Been at Walgreens since 1230
But let me make this little bit of extra money since I missed Thursday .
Welp let Walgreens sucker me into coming at 1230 instead of my usual time of 4.
Hopefully it's an 11-5 shift so I can chill most of the day
I have no idea what time I'm suppose to be at work tomorrow lol
Up drinking this slush and watching Criminal Minds on Netflix .
I can't wait to go active duty
I didn't know they were putting jolly ranchers in the slushed now. I'm gonna have to try it
Pineapple slush with nerds from sonic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

It wasn't my best semester but it surely wasn't my worst to date. Blessed to say I finished tho
Everybody left me in BR. Two of my best friends are in Cali until like the end of the month and Sarah is in Alabama. I'm bored
Job #2 coming soon. Just wait and see
Blessed to say I'm done.
My snaps on snapchat be so petty
I'm queen of the petty snaps.
I'm doing this for everyone who said I couldn't
It's a full moon out. Just know if ya nigga get to acting different that's why.
This Shit AINT for everybody
Lol I will not be discouraged from what I want to do. No matter what I will do what I want
*got
So now he's laying beside me. Sleep. And I've just realized the magnitude of my love for him.
So then we laid in the bed and joked around and talked about old times and then he hit sleepy because he'd been at work all night
My boyfriend came home from work today and was telling be how he couldn't wait to come home so he could go to sleep with me
Time to shine baby
So I just talked to a recruiter and I swear I'm just about the happiest person alive
Final 2 done
What moms don't understand is I'm in debt with 26k on my head. How we gonna make something shake with that ? How we suppose to live ?
The decision has been made.
I'm already knowing my decision isn't gonna be well liked but to see who supports me in this decision despite their feelings.
I swear to yall I'm walking out on faith with my decision.
I know this journey isn't going to be easy but that is okay . I want this so bad.
It's like everything I've seen this morning is a sign from God. Telling me I'm making the right decision.
When I have kids I'll never force them to go to college if they have other plans they'd like to pursue.
I hate that my mom doesn't support my decision but she'll get over it. I'm done living MY life how she wants me to.
Now that I've made up my mind I could honestly care less.
My first final of the day took me no more than 15 minutes.
Omg my feet hurt so bad. 10 hours on your feet will do that to you
Just one hour left
6 hours down , 4 more to go. Then home to cook dinner for Bae and study for my two finals tomorrow
These customers are getting on my nerves
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I think my mom is finally understanding how much I really hate college
So with that being said. I'm finally getting to do what I've been wanting to do since I graduated high school 2 years ago.
What's funny is that I think this is some roundabout way of God showing me that I have to live for me and not for anyone else.
Jesus be my test, be my pencil Lord. Be the grader Lord. Keep me focused Lord.
Lord Jesus I just pray right now that I am able to recall the information that I have studied for this final.
In trouble with my XO. But this is nothing new. They always tryna find a reason to kick me out . Too bad I ain't going no where
Probably bout to say goodbye to Twitter also.
Deleting my Instagram
I never sit outside anymore .
100 steps forward , 1000 steps back. I'll never make it to my destination like this.
I refuse to have a break down during finals.
Cal final Friday
Let me put on some sweats and head to class I'm not with the shits today. Last day of class.
@Ode2Ke you ma'am are ratchet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And they weren't normal pimples. It was like those big huge pimples that make you wanna throw up.
The swamp. And he had a face full of pimples.
And he swore up and down I was his girlfriend. We had only talked like twice and I met him once and he look like something that crawled out
I remember in like middle school or high school I remember I let my friend set me up with this boy she knew. And he was just the ugliest
And I need socks because I'll end up rubbing my feet on everything with in distance and I'll never get any sleep
Like I don't like sleeping with my little boobs all free and shit . The little bit I got need stay still. I turn in my sleep too much
I sleep bad when I dont have on socks and a sports bra.

@taylorchristeen lol yeah I'm going to summer school and I have an apartment down here

Feeling confident about this cal final on Friday . I been studying my ass off. Calling into work and everything just to get extra time

Ooh bitch my power is out!!!
Southern better quit playing
I swear as soon I finished typing my paper this is fuvking storm came outta no where
Bae comes home today
My timeline is dry. Someone speak to me
I'm not fully myself around my boyfriend. Sometimes I am but not always. Still working on that
I'm only truly my full unapologetic self with like 3 sets of people. My family , my best and my ROTC fam.
Finally found my lighter
Every time I'm on my period I get overly emotional.
I need to go smoke me a black and chill the fuck out. Clear my head !
Like fuck! Where is my best friend when I need him?
I'm so emotional right now
I told my boyfriend my belly button hurt and he was like ok?
I want mozzarella sticks
Got to talk to bae a little bit this morning. He'll be home tomorrow and I just can't wait to see him.
Mean Girls is on !!!!!!!
I'm sincerely working on my attitude
Bae comes home tomorrow. I just have to make it thru on more night of sleeping alone.
My boyfriend cut his mustache off and I'm slightly upset. I didn't like it at first but I got use to it. Now it's gone and he looks weird.
It is pouring down outside
I can't sit in my house and do homework I gotta go somewhere to get this shit done
Calculus makes me want to quit college
Joint Military Ball tonight .
I'm so sick right now .
My head is killing me.
Surprisingly I slept for more than 4 hours last night.
It's crazy that I'm gonna be a whole junior in the fall. Like it doesn't feel like I've spent 2 years in college already.
I just pray to God I make it
And the other half know about the work it takes they just not willing to do it. But complain when they choose to be with a ain't shit nigga
Like all these females talk about how they want this ol fabulous ass relationship and half of them don't realize how much work go into it.
I just hear my neighbors having sex. That shit did not sound satisfying at all. Poor lady.
I completely forgot my apartment has a dishwasher because I never use it. It could be a dead body in there and I just wouldn't know a thing
Watching Dr. Miami snapchat makes me want to throw up but then again I can't look away because it's kind of interesting
All my followers are saying exactly what I'm feeling
@rome_skyhigh what ? It's true !!
I would text best but he doesn't know how to text back so it would be a wasted effort
Jerome sucks !!!
Like really besides best and May my boyfriend is one of my best friend
I just wanna go to sleep and then wake up and it be next Monday so bae can be home.
I told myself I was gonna go to sleep but I'm up eating a Popsicle.
I need to go to sleep
I know my fake ass best friend ain't favoriting my tweets but didn't text me back from like 2 weeks ago. I just know he isn't.
I don't understand why I have all this energy.
Gonna make a solid attempt at going to sleep right now. Wish me luck
Up studying calculus. And I actually understood it all.
It's gonna be a long week
I really can't sleep because my boyfriend isn't here.
I'm so bored and not sleepy but I know once I start doing homework Ima get super sleepy.
Can it be next Monday already . I miss bae too much
Bae left for Cali this morning. It's only been like 5-6 hours and I'm so bored. Like omg can he come home already
#RedNose 
Just finished some calculus homework. Feeling pretty good about it. Now let me go to sleep like I don't have an 8 o'clock
Because I mean what ever happened to be having dreams and being happy ? When did life become so mundane ?
I just know I was put on this earth to do more than pay bills and die.
I don't need someone to do the work for me. I need someone to break it down for me so that I can understand ,
Someone please help me pass calculus. I just need a C
This weather sucks and I'm not driving across town I'm already knowing southern campus probably flooded
Never make someone your everything unless you're ready to have nothing if they leave.
My sister got married yesterday. I'm not but happy for her.
My favorite player @tpolamalu is retiring. After 12 amazing years of football he is leaving the @steelers. I'm crying real tears right now <CRYING CAT FACE>

Yall ever been lowkey hurt on some shit you gotta act like it don't effect you but really it's all you can think about and it hurts so bad
Or maybe I'll just drink this gin and sit outside
I think I'm about to take a drive .
Sometimes I feel like every time I take two steps forward I end up twenty steps back . I don't know how I'm doing this
Got a little bit of gin in the kitchen. Kinda wanna go down that shit .
I swear once I see my momma and daddy ima cry hard asf.
It'll be one year come August that I haven't physically seen my family.
Took my family for granted until I was 1000 miles away nd couldn't see them like I want to. I miss them like crazy. <CRYING FACE> 
Everyone wants to be black until it's time to be black.
Working 8-4. Then just enjoy time with my boyfriend and his family
Let me go to sleep like I don't gotta work all day tomorrow
@Blvckfvshion_ yeah

@Blvckfvshion_ Burbank and gardere

When someone remembers all the little things about you &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I have a 6 page paper due tomorrow. Guess I'll get started now.
I was gonna say something but I'll keep it to myself. It's not good to generalize based off of one person's actions.
Niggas be petty af
My boyfriend irritates me
@Ode2Ke I never got a message from you . I'm going to text you now
@Ode2Ke how are you tho? And the baby ?
@Ode2Ke lol I miss you too . All is great . Almost done with sophomore year. Changed my major , got an apartment and a boyfriend.
I started running. Ran a mile then had to go shit.
My struggle at the gym is too real right now.

thank you‚Ä¶some of us like the reminder.
@MrGrey_ Walgreens and cvs
Yall God really just looked out for me. Praise him !!!
I hate for a muthafcka to give me advice on something they know absolutely nothing about.
My unit's HR assistant bought me Starbucks after my prt today because I always ask him for coffee.
It's super hard to stay awake in calculus. I've never struggled so much to just be conscious
I'm just saying this unit can only tell you you're a shitbag so many times before ones starts to believe it's true.
Because even when you do everything right you're still doing it wrong.
I thank god for my best friend. If no one else believes in me I know he does .
Any body up that cares to listen to me vent about my issues. I'm having anxiety and my boyfriend isn't here
Got a lot on my mind. I have to make the best decision for me.

I swear I work with a bunch of grown ass kids .
Happy Tuesday guys !!
If your answer is No , which of course it is, then you have absolutely no right to be disrespectful to those who protect you.
Like did you wake up as a bomb goes off in the distance ? Did terrorists come into your home and rape the women and kill your men ?
We literally give up our lives so that others are protected and able to live the life they live. And they have the nerve to be disrespectful
I can't stand people who don't respect people in the military. Like they just don't get it .
Anyone wanna go laugh at my stupidity on snapchat feel free. bevlashonx3
Omg my anniversary is Friday.
Happy birthday to my fav thottie. 20 years old !!!

I have to get myself together and quickly  before I'm assed out and in a bunch of debt.
What the hell is wrong with me!!! I'm literally on my last chance and I continue to play games like I have room to do so.
Sometimes you just have to take a personal day from school.
I was so excited because I was understanding my calculus homework . I  ended up with a 86.67% but that way better than what I thought I'd do
Someone just rear ended me but by the grace of God me and my car are fine

Thank God for this blessing
Can everyone just a send a prayer up for me that I find a new job
Just praying that this hotel calls me for an interview
Happy birthday to my little brother , my grandfather and my boyfriend's dad.

Already planning and getting sexy for my anniversary. Hair done, face beat, nails and toes on yasssss . Lingerie on <SMIRKING FACE>.
All this time I had people who were loving me how I wanted to be loved but I finally found someone who loves me how I need to be loved.
Gotta call my midget baby. Gotta start planning my anniversary
Not love . That's not even close to love. I don't know who put these thoughts in yall heads but it's gotta stop.
I feel like people have this unrealistic view of love where everything is perfect and they don't argue and you always get your way but thats
I believe in love. I always have. I always will. My relationship which is full of love could end right now and I'm still going to believe
@vintxgeblack it really is sad .
@ShaUdmoney_Era I've seen genuine love more times then I can count. Why is  it that people act like its a fairy tale ?
Yall see a happy couple and automatically say well one of them must be cheating no one is truly loyal. Why does it have to be like that?
Who hurt yall so bad that yall can't trust and can't love?
And when they see real love right in front of their face they try to make it seem like that isn't what it it. They try to poke holes in it.
This generation is so screwed up in the head they truly believe everyone is out to hurt them. They believe no one can genuinely love anymore
@_intelLEXtual what did we do in class today ?
Stoicville -Tpain <HEADPHONE><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
These no way she shouldn't have a full ride to college. Shit I'm on a full ride and I was like in the top 38% of my class.
I'm so proud of my little sister. Out of 711 juniors in her high school class she is #60. Which means she's in the top 9% of her class.
I hope CVS calls me.
Just did my taxes.
Just tryna get my taxes done and get to spend bae day with bae before I go to work
I thank God everyday for this wonderful man I wake up to every morning. I'm so blessed
I almost cried. If I wasn't such a G I would have
I come home from work and he cooked me steak and potatoes . Then he gave me a stuffed animal and a card.
This morning when I got up he didn't give me anything so I was in a bad mood all day and then I had to go to work.
For the past few weeks my boyfriend was telling me he didn't celebrate Valentine's Day .
I wanna kill my bf right now
@Cara_Baby <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE> I know ill probably call you tonight when I get off

But luckily my phone interview for my stamps is Monday. Hopefully no more coming out of pocket for food.
I spent 246$ on groceries for just me and my boyfriend. I've never felt so depressed.
In the long run the asshole is going to really care when it counts and he loves you more than he shows
Boyfriends who are assholes about certain things are better than boyfriends who give/let you do whatever you want.
It's cold af and raining. I'm trying to get over the flu. Come on louisiana just a girl live
I hate when people constantly tell me I'm an asshole. Like I know this You know this everyone knows. Can we find a new topic to discuss ?
I just seen this girl with peep toe heels on . Baby yo big toe not cold hanging over the edge of yo shoe splashing that rain water ?
I hate when I'm sitting on the floor nd someone stands directly infront of me. If you don't get yo dick/pussy/ass outta my breathing space <UNAMUSED FACE>
Cleaned the house, took some more meds, ate some Cheerios and now I'm going to attempt to sleep. Wish me luck

Lol I love a bitch who has a lot of mouth until I come around then they silent as fuck. They make me laugh so hard.
Lol so I guess she call herself not speaking to me. But I give somewhere between zero and two fucks. But it's really closer to zero. <SMIRKING FACE>

People been saying I've changed like I was spending my whole life working to stay the same.
@ShaUdmoney_Era I have she still the same dumb bitch she started out being. So it's outta my hands . I tried.
@ShaUdmoney_Era I truly believe she is slow and no one ever told her. I really don't like that bitch
I'm convinced my roommate is a fucking idiot. I've never met a stupider person than her. I know mental handicap people who have higher IQs
Got another 20 minutes before my class starts
I have horrible luck with foreign teachers. They never seem to like me and I don't know why.
All the foreign people on campus hang out in T.T Allain.
It always rains on the first day of the semester at southern.
If she was t pregnant I'd beat the fuck outta her
I'm really fuckn drove. Because I hate to let a muthafcka get over on me.
So we decided on Florida for our anniversary vacation. Now we have to figure out where in Florida
Trying to plan our mini vacation for our anniversary and it's stressing me out. We have no idea where to go.
I can't stand ah muthafcka who don't do shit but complain about everything. Like what have you contributed to this? ....Ooh right nothing
Where is bae?
But it's my baby 4th birthday she's a big girl now. Gonna start kindergarten soon. <CRYING FACE> they grow up so fast.
Just talked to my niece. All she ever do is ask to talk to my boyfriend. She be like Uncle Av Uncle Av. <UNAMUSED FACE>
My niece will be 4 today. I miss my baby. I wish I was at home to take her to Chuck E Cheese
I'm so tired of hearing my roommates argue I'm ready to move out. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
The Lord isn't going to stop blessing me and I'm so thankful
‚Äú@the_humbleTiger: @SaveThe_Tits well hi Beverley bell smh‚Äù I would speak but you definitely spelled my name wrong.
All I ask is that you don't feed me bullshit and call it steak.
Anniversary gift or nah?
I want a new Kate Spade satchel. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Hear more than you speak. You'll learn more
Don't try me because you'll find out I'm the right one that night. <PISTOL>
I can't sleep . I don't know where all this energy is coming from
I will never allow another to dictate my feelings or actions. That's giving them too much power. And I won't let them have it.
I'll just leave them and their silliness wherever I found them.
I'll never treat people how they've treated me because God didn't give me that kind of heart.
I finally got the memo tho.
I give people so many chances to do right by me but they always do me dirty. Time and time again.
I left some people in 2014 when they should have been left in 2013 or better yet when I had the original thought in 2012.
That chicken I just made was life .
Cara never text me. <PENSIVE FACE> I miss my big sister .
@rome_skyhigh  well you suck <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@rome_skyhigh I called you Saturday but it's was mad early.

Good night everyone
It'll hurt you more than it hurts me. I can promise you that in the long run.
I know my boyfriend really loves me because he's currently driving around Baton Rouge look for hot chocolate for me
Don't be afraid because you can't see the path right now . It will become very clear once you begin to walk. But first you must walk.
Sometimes you have to step out on faith and know that God is going to carry you to a place that he has prepared just for you.
I be up all night when my boyfriend isn't with me. I swear I don't sleep well without him.
Some days I just wanna quit school and just focus on baking. It's truly what I love to do
You worried bout the wrong thing honey.
I hate trifling grown people. Done left dirty dishes in the kitchen for the last 3-4 days. But you worried about the company I have coming ?
I got gas for 2.19 today. Praise the lord !!!
@chapaleee thank you !!
And today I'm done apologizing for being myself fully and truly. If you can't deal with it then don't befriend me I promise I won't be hurt
I have a very strong personality and it's not something everyone can handle and for too long I've been apologizing about it .
I realized a long time ago. I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I'm truly a unique and acquired taste.
for as long as I can remember I been the only one riding for me. And that's okay bc these so called bf be the ones shooting u n the back
Yall scared to ride alone so you kissing ass to have a car full.
Just got called into work for 1230 til close at 1030. Bout to get my money. Next check gonna be looking beautiful.
It'll always be easier to say You can't do it than to try. But excuses are for the weak and simple minded and you are anything but.
For the measure you give will be the measure you get back. - Luke 6:38
Give&amp; it shall be given to you.Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over shall be put into your lap.
Any time someone tells me to blessed , I automatically feel better.

Only 2 finals next week. Praise Him <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I wish I was going home for the holidays.
Up writing this 8 page essay
Every time a white person isn't charged with taking a black life the US court system is telling the world that black lives are expendable
He just said the grand jury gave up their lives for this decision. No Mike Brown gave up his life for nothing at all. That's who lost here.
I don't ever want to have a son. Because this world doesn't value black male lives. I wouldn't want to fear for his life everyday.
I only allow myself to be ratchet on Mondays during love and HipHop.

Nice little turn up and I'm in the bed before 1am .
And if you refuse to let go of your old friends you'll never really get to that place God was trying to take you to.
Ones whose lives are going in the same direction as yours. Ones with similar goals and ambitions.
And while it's going suck at first you'll get over it and make new ones.
One thing I've learned is that sometimes God is going to take you places and he isn't going to allow your old friends to come.
Lol I'm glad my best friend is my suite mate . I just walk in her room any time and say dumb shit and laugh with her .
6 days until my 19th birthday ! <DANCER><DANCER><DANCER>

Damnit I know my baby is hurting so bad right now and I'm no where near him to comfort him. I just pray The Lord gives him peace of mind.
Feeling so alone
I figured out a long time ago that God is taking me in a different direction than my friends and that's why my circle is getting smaller
I just want a shower and to lay in my bed naked.
Talking to bae is the only thing that calms my nerves when I'm irritated. Well him or French fries and coffee.
If nothing else I know I am amazingly and extraordinarily blessed and I'll never take these experiences for granted.
I crawled around in a missile. I got to drive a submarine and stand on the bridge as we moved thru the water. Shit is amazing.
How many can say they slept in a berthing directly between two nuclear missiles. Not too many people in the world can say that. But I can.
I'm so blessed with the opportunities I e been given. How many people can say they've gotten to ride on a nuclear powered submarine ?
@iAmTitana come up to my room

Because if you still sitting in your issues and then you get in a relationship you carrying over hurt from the last person and hurting the
I understand that you're scared of being hurt again but you have to take that chance.
Just know while you sitting in your trust issues you could be missing out on the best person ever.

This generation has soo many damn trust issues then complain about wanting a good relationship then say they can't get close to anyone

@gurlindetention lol girl so am I and I'm a server at a hotel and it not that bad. I made 60 in tips this morning it really is easy money
My feet are killing me !!
I'm so glad I'm off tomorrow
@gurlindetention hell yeah definitely !! And you're pretty (no homo) so you'd definitely make a lot in tips being a waitress
@gurlindetention depending on where you work you can make a lot in tips
But I don't know what I'm talking about .
Some times it isn't the man that isn't good it's the woman.
All woman are the same just like you're claiming all men are the same.
If you aren't a good woman you will use and abuse a good man making him lock up his heart thinking all women are the same making him think
How do expect to get and keep this man and you're not a good woman?
I'm tired of women saying I want a good man but what they don't realize is that to get and keep a GOOD man you must first be a good woman!!
About to go on a quick little two second rant.
Sitting here with my daily and texting my baby.
A calm sea has never produced a skilled sailor.

I have so much planned for when my boyfriend comes out here but I already know all we gonna do is lay around in the hotel room.
I offer my help and I'm given attitude. Ooh that's fine trust I won't offer anymore.
Soon as I said I missed him he called me. 7 more days then he gets to go home. Then 2 months until I see him.
I miss my boyfriend so much <TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE>

My family has this ability to piss me off like no one else can. Then when I get piss off they wanna act shocked like what's wrong w/ you?

I live my life like an old white lady , I wake up in the morning and make toast and tea and sit outside to read my book. lol
Making fries. I love cooking
When you honestly love someone there is nothing anyone can do or say to change that.
Sitting here deep conditioning still. I'm really just to lazy to wash this out right now lol
If I have to work two or three jobs to get what I want then so be it .
@LovelyMotives which one you work at ? And are they hiring ?
@BonjourJuliet lol you cutting up probably broke it on purpose
I need a nice one bedroom apartment in a nice part of BR and isn't too far from SU. I'm not really concerned about price.
About to wash my hair and while I deep condition search for apartments
What are some nice apartments in BR ? Gotta start looking now even though I'm not getting one until like January .

When people ask for my number and they like ima text you and never do. I'm Like what was your point I'm doing all that ?
Starting tomorrow I start my no fast good diet. That's means I shall enjoy my Chinese today
Sitting here eating mini cream cheese croissants waiting on bae to text me back.
@MarlonikaConley lol thanks darling
Having a boyfriend in the military is so hard , me being in the military also makes things even harder. But I wouldn't change a thing.
My boyfriend just texted me I'm smiling so hard right now
Mine too sad faces for us ‚Äú@MarlonikaConley: My baby will be gone for two weeks <PENSIVE FACE>‚Äù
OITNB is a show me and my boyfriend watch together so I have to wait until august when I'm with him to watch the new season. <WEARY FACE>
I just got to talk to my boyfriend for 5 minutes just now and I swear I'm the happiest girl in the world .
I'm so frustrated because I miss my boyfriend. He usually keeps me in a good mood so not being able to talk to him is aggravating me.
@Cara_Baby okay and idk I just been in the house being boring .
@Cara_Baby where you moving to?
On some real shit I only fuck with like 3-5 people at the most. I'm not really a people person I get aggravated too quickly.
I'm bored !!!!
Asked my boyfriend for a monkey he told me I can just have a baby. Told him I don't wanna get fat he said he'd get me a treadmill . Smh
My phone bout to be dry af for these two weeks while bae is gone. He the only person I talk to
Not being able to talk to him for two weeks is gonna be hard but well make it thru
He makes me a better person and I love him for that.
If I could just see him for a day if be so happy.
This happens quite frequently. It's like we're connected.
It's weird that my boyfriend and I are in 2 different states but we randomly wake up at the same time and he'll txt me to see if I'm up
He just pissed me the fuck off
@LovelyMotives congrats and good luck twinn !! #moneytrain <STEAM LOCOMOTIVE><MONEY BAG>

I'm never gonna beg or be up anybody's ass to see or spend time with them. If you wanna see me you know the number.
Tryna figure out a new IG name
The conversation me and my boyfriend had tonight was real af. It was really needed .
@LovelyMotives lol tell that clown to gtf
I do way too much for people just for people to basically say fuck me every other day.
Is it so much to ask for that I be appreciated !???!??
I'm so tired of bullshit. Really I am.
God just keeps on blessing me. I'm just so thankful
My boyfriend knows he frustrates me when he gets drunk and be doing dumb stuff. I be ready to fight him
I'm hungry but I don't know what I'm craving. #decisionsdecisions
Just when I was at my wits end God showed up and he showed out. Praise be to him
Praise God !!!!
Praying I'm able to work both of these jobs. I'd rather be tired than broke
So as I was getting frustrated about not having a job I got a call for an interview on Tuesday. Praise be to God.
I don't know why I call my mom thinking she'll make me feel better about things when in reality all she does is piss me off.
Starting to get really frustrated with not having a job.
If my boyfriend comes to visit for the 4th if July I'll be the happiest girl in the world. I miss the hell outta him
Seems like there are never enough hours in the day when you know you have to leave someone you love soon
I'm ready to be back in BR. There is nothing and no one here for me besides my nieces and nephews .
I'm so in love with my boyfriend its some kind if ridiculous. Like he's my best friend and everything.
My mom just pissed me the hell off.
Distance does to a relationship what wind does to a fire. Extinguishes the weak and fuels the strong .
Just laying here talking to my baby I miss him so much right now.
Y'all I'm scared of old white people !!! Lol
Happiness is a choice ; choose it.
Think I'm about to make some biscuits .
My boyfriend called and woke me up to tell me that I give him butterflies and he's really in love with me. I can't do anything but smile.
August needs to hurry up so my boyfriend be here, I can go back to BR and I can celebrate my 19th birthday.
I just have so much on my mind
I just feel like breaking down
I'm so aggravated.
In the emergency room with my sister in law. Just praying she's going to be okay
My boyfriend told me I look beautiful tho I look like a pile of shit right now. He's so nice I guess I'll keep him lol
It's been a long night and while I'm tired I'm not sleepy
Just thanking God that my sister in law and her cousin are okay.
Please pray for my family!
Got both of the babies sleep just chilling now. Probably about to FaceTime the bae.
Watching both of my nieces. They too hype at 11pm.
Just bought 5 scratch offs and didn't win anything lol
I need a job
I just wanna be held by my boyfriend. But in all honesty I won't be wrapped in his arms for another 3 months.
These three months apart are hard as fuck and it's only been a week. We've facetimed everyday multiple times a day since I left.
I miss my boyfriend so much right now it's ridiculous. I damn near wanna cry sitting on FaceTime with him right now.
@Cara_Baby ahhhhhh nooooooo !!!!
@Cara_Baby nothing in the bed , we're going to Applebee's tonight you down ??
@Cara_Baby whatcha doing love ?
Hey you @Cara_Baby !!!!!

Thanking God I got paid today even though I'm not at school !!!
I miss my boyfriend <PENSIVE FACE>
My baby finally went to sleep , so now I'm off to sleep too
My boyfriend is staying up studying for finals so I'm up with him encouraging him .
Guys will know exactly what they have in front of them but swear up and down they didn't realize until it walked away.
Leaving my boyfriend for 3 months is going to be so hard. Gonna miss him like crazy. Hope he knows we face timing every night
This whole day I thought it was Wednesday smh I need sleep my days are running together
I just wanna sleep <TIRED FACE>
I haven't slept in like 2 days
Sitting here about to cry thinking about the fact I get to go home next week. I've been gone for 5 months. I miss my family
I want to sleep so bad but it just won't come. Guess I'm just gonna grind it out until I fall asleep
Lol sleep ? What is that ???
I hate everyone right now
Just seems like I'm never good enough. And that just fucking sucks .
Trying to figure out what I'm fighting for. Seems like I'm the only one fighting anymore. Just trying to figure out is it worth it.
Sometimes a good cry and a talk with God is what's needed. Taking a break from social networks gotta get myself back together.
Someone be a real nigga and bring me some sonic fries.
Getting cute you know what I'm about to do ? Sit in my dorm and write this paper. Lol #SB2K14 
I want some Chinese
I have absolutely no energy right now. I haven't been out the bed all day. I'm so drained
My boyfriend has spoiled me , I can't sleep without him anymore. This whole week that he's been gone I've slept bad.
Me and Gogo (my stuffed jaguar) about to go to sleep. My head is killing me.
Missing my boyfriend and it's cold in my room and I have a headache. Just gonna lay here I wanna cry.

If you ask me why I do anything that I do my respond will be "because one day I might get hit by a bus"
I miss my boyfriend
I dream with my eyes wide open and my head in the clouds while I lay on the ground.
Hopefully it rains all night and tomorrow morning until 6 so they cancel pt.
Love is the closest thing we have to magic
Broke the fuck outta my phone . It still works but the screen is like popped outside the frame. Gonna get a new one next week .
Patiently waiting for my roommate to leave . *rolls eyes*
I miss my boyfriend <WEARY FACE>
Miserable people just want someone to be miserable with. That's why "friends" try to ruin your relationship.
It's sad to say that even your friends will be jealous of your relationship when theirs isn't going as well.
I feel like crying
I think my boyfriend likes me but hates me at the same time. If that makes any sense.
Happy Wednesday!!! Just gotta get thru today and tomorrow and I'll be all good.
Let me get up and put on this uniform and go to class.
Get a dude; drop the tude. If you get what I'm saying.
Sprint drills this morning.
@Niyaaaaa__ lol what ?
Baby should be here in an hour. I missed him so much
SU don't have no wifi or no cable right now
My boyfriend deserves man of the year award or something because Lord knows he puts up with soo much when dealing with me.
Ugh my boyfriend is about to be in Monroe all weekend. I'm bout to be bored as hell.
I should be getting up but I'm too lazy right now
Bout to start shopping on base. Shit isn't taxed. That be life.
Went to Belle Chasse with my baby today. Had fun with his stupid ass
When you have everyone looking down on you it feels amazing to have someone in your corner cheering you on.
I swear I have an amazing ass boyfriend !!
My boyfriend , even in the short time that we've been together, makes me a better person honestly. I would never admit it to him tho lol
@taylorchristeen lol exactly. Witcha crazy ass .
@taylorchristeen lol now you have to meet him and I think it's going to be so funny
@taylorchristeen lol yeah but when you get back I have to tell you a whole bunch of shit.
I met my boyfriend when we were all playing monopoly in my friend's apartment one day. lol it's was so random
The fact that my friend's couch has been like my second bed over the last month.

I honestly should have been told hella people to get the fuck. But I'm such a nice person I didn't and now I'm in the place I'm in now
Because it's fuck Beverly right ? Yeah alright I got it.
I'm so exhausted
Always remember birds of a feather . . . You know the rest.
When you look at someone and realize they barely have any eyebrows. I be thinking like how did I not notice all this time.
I'm just so into my thoughts right now.
God places people in your life for a reason.
Bout to stop doing what I been doing because evidently that shit isn't working out.
Always feels like I'm never good enough.
Good morning

@NaeBornToBeGr8 let's get it !!
I'm so happy, our school ended tying for 6th place in our drill meet last weekend out of 22 schools. And the whole squad was freshman.
If life was a game of pulling straws I swear I'd lose ever time. I always get the short end of everything.
I don't fucking understand this shit. I honestly don't. How do I continually end up with the short end of the stick ?
I swear I be willing and ready to give the world to people only for them to sit up in my face and basically say fuck you you not worth shit.
Damn smh I quit
@LovelyMotives girl you know I'm down here in Baton Rouge, everybody on campus going crazy.
Why do I keep letting my feelings get hurt ?
They say it takes 30 consistent days to form a habit. If I can quit for 30 days I'll have nothing to worry about.
@NaeBornToBeGr8 lmao okay we'll start tomorrow gotta get the last ones out today.
@TeeTeeSaid_ me too. It's getting out of hand so I need to stop.
