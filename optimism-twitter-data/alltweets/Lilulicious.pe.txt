I'm not usually that good with Annie - Lilulicious just went 19/6/24 as Annie on Howling Abyss #LeagueOfLegends 
Couldn't have said it better myself, just adding <HORSE> for mine! 
@tbfkaNameless I know. It makes no sense that an ebook costs as much as a paper book. No paper, shipping, storage. I don't get it.
@Call_Me_Ep1c Right on!<THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Call_Me_Ep1c Dammit, I'm out of good responses. I like that one though, never heard it before!
@tbfkaNameless Have you looked into Kindle Unlimited on Amazon. $10/month for a very large selection of books, as many as you want to read.
The thing is I don't know where I want this ambition to lead, so I'll see where the road goes and meet people I ordinarily wouldn't get to.
@Call_Me_Ep1c Gotta cough to get off! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But the female politicians were in satin trimmed suits, so I felt like I was right in the middle there, so at least it felt comfortable.
In other news, "business elegant" was the right choice. The cops wives looked like they were at prom, of course.
@Call_Me_Ep1c Don't bogart that joint, my friend, pass it around. ;)
Anyway, that crap is stressful, even though I sort of love it in a weird, ambitious way. It gives me a spark of confidence, too. A paradox.
Like too many people trying to talk to you at the same time and trying to keep up with all of them and be polite, you know?
It's not just anxiety, it's also a feeling of being overwhelmed by too many people, and trying to pay attention to political etiquette.
As such, I usually have to smoke a bowl when I get home from one of these dinners to unwind and reflect. Too much false sparkle and smile.
Now, contrary to popular belief, here and in "real life", I do suffer from social anxieties like many of you do. So events can be taxing.
@Killadrix ;)
Oh, I have to get my cigar! 
#foodporn Dinner and dessert choices. 
Real life #strongfemalelead  
I've never had crisp grilled pear on a salad before. Amazeballs!
@bldngnerd Lol, this is a trap!
Got my photo ops with the state attorney general, a US Congresswoman,  met the sheriff and a state senator. Busy 20 minutes. #presstheflesh
@BajandHarry @zerena_hoofs LOL!
ALADS Awards Banquet, representing CAPE. (@ The Westin Bonaventure Hotel &amp; Suites, Los Angeles in Los Angeles, CA) 
@zerena_hoofs Thanks, mami!
@icywiz Lol, it wasn't bad, but I am at a loss for an answer! :p
@BaleyBlue Thanks, sweetness!
@RealTerrorwulf @Killadrix Yeah, weirdness! &lt;3
@RealTerrorwulf @Killadrix I don't know, it was working for me, too. *shrug* :p
@Killadrix @RealTerrorwulf Have him eat a banana in front of you like that. 

Have I said too much?
@RealTerrorwulf @Killadrix I leave the house for a moment...
@Killadrix @RealTerrorwulf Dammit, Dan!
@RealTerrorwulf @Killadrix I think Dan needs a hug, Jay. No kisses though, at least not with tongue! :p
Ready to head downtown! 
@celeriekt Yep, that's the one I want, then! ^.^
Better to take the low road on this one.
Because these sheriff's wives treat it like it's they're own little Met Gala. Only a bit on the trashy side. Satin and lamé out the ass.
Going to a fancy schmancy sheriff's union awards dinner tonight, repping my own union. My wardrobe choice is "business elegant."
@MichaelJPetty Grats!
@strumpet101 Aging doesn't seem to work as well for fish as it does for beef.
@strumpet101 I've smelled it before. My courage failed me at that point. :p
@strumpet101 Does this mean we have to eat lutefisk!?
@wowmartiean I still have my VHS tapes that I should transfer to DVD, quality be damned.
@Killadrix @RealTerrorwulf I'm surprised it wasn't Jay snoring, he's gotten my cold.
@JulesRPG For him, life is infinitely more simple to coach: more petting, more feeding, more petting. Oh, did I mention more feeding? ;)
@MichaelJPetty @zerena_hoofs If I were a dog, this is where I'd be wagging my tail!
@Leetawow &lt;3
@Leetawow Yeah, a moment of thoughtlessness I can tolerate. But repetitive negativity, out wit' ye! :p
@zerena_hoofs God, I feel you. I **hate** the store. And I have to get high before I even attempt Costco because there'll be bloodshed.
@zerena_hoofs Oh, hence the cheap tequila.
@Leetawow That's a big ol' NOPE! GTFO!
@Leetawow When someone says they get why people criticize fat people and not thin ones, or how gluttony and laziness have become the norm...
@Leetawow I agree, that's my biggest battle. But that's especially when I need to cut openly insulting and negative people out of my life.
@ShaofHappiness People are so thoughtless. They don't know how you suffered as you lost that weight, as long as you looked good to them.
I am so fucking sick of assumptions and stereotypes, I am no longer shy from telling someone to fuck right the hell off. Because I mean it.
Skinny people shouldn't be shamed and told they don't eat enough, fat people shouldn't be shamed and told they're gluttons. Neither is true.
I don't get how anyone thinks that being prejudiced about people's body types is any different from any other prejudice.
@Tzeriel @Faythemage I'm sorry, dude, you're cool and all, but I get off the boat here. Your prejudice is just not welcome anymore.
@Faythemage @Tzeriel Amen to that. Signed: the fatty.
No miracles today. La Liga title is fairly well lost. No Copa Del Rey. And UEFA CL is looking shaky, too. More boo. 
Dear lord, just one more. 
@15minutegamer Oh, I'm so sorry, friend. :(
I hate to sound hopeless, but it sure looks like FC Barcalosers are going to take the title. Unless a miracle occurs and they falter, too.
Wake up late and see this. 2 goals down at home when they need 3 points to take the top of the La Liga table. Boo. 
I think I've rather taken to trolling comments on FB stories. It's liberating.
@Amijadethelock Yay, oh despicable one! \o/
@UnholyAlliances Perfect, I'll get started on the team muscle T's and secret decoder rings! You're in, right?
Winner winner, chicken dinner! 
@Alairthephoenix &lt;3
@Alairthephoenix And I could have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!
@clockwork_bells @Faythemage Now, when they turn on each other, it's a bit more clear.
@clockwork_bells @Faythemage I thought I's weeded out most of the offenders. Maybe because some of the ones I kept I thought were victims.
@MichaelJPetty Ah, the Peruvian food! Looks fantastic, but I've never had it. I've had Ecuadorian, don't know if it's similar.
@CasuallyCasual There are several, in fact. And if you don't get a secret decoder ring, that crap is bogus!
@Faythemage @clockwork_bells Pretty much, but it gets ugly when they cannibalize each other.
@CasuallyCasual YESSSS!!!! Lol!
@Faythemage @clockwork_bells You missed nothing of consequence.
@Faythemage @clockwork_bells Well, it's two separate things that I sort of vented about back to back. But yes, typical quibbling and egos.
@CasuallyCasual I hear Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On... Womp womp womp wao... :p
@Alairthephoenix LOL! Surprise!
@FlyDraenei Tell me about it! 
@Xandara We could be like the Fantanas! (Have you seen those commercials for Fanta soda?)
@FlyDraenei Muscle T's. We're going old school!
@PerpetualCaster Haha, awwww! <FACE THROWING A KISS>Team Avi's Army ftw!
Team Lilu! Lilu's Army? Yeah, how about we not do that, it's pretty fucking presumptuous, isn't it?
Hey, I think that if I want to be a successful online personality, I need to start referring to my followers as my Army. Or my Team.
Next up on Dateline: When Attention Whores Collide.

Oh, nvm, I see that all the time.
@MichaelJPetty Oh yeah, I totally know! :p
@SunshineDagron Happy Birthday!
@FlyDraenei They're a great stadium act, though. And the set list has grown along with the venues, so it's all good!
@FlyDraenei I am! That was the closest I've ever gotten, the venues just got bigger from there. Weenie Roast is always a good time, though!
@FlyDraenei Is that the little show at the Mayan? I think the first time I saw them was at the Wiltern in 2004.
@Azerrah Wow, yeah, I see what you mean, about both orientate and commentate. English r hardd.
@Azerrah Is it really? I always thought you "orient" yourself rather than "orientate" yourself. I guess you're right about the -ates.
Tommy's tonight. Cc: @MichaelJPetty 
@Azerrah Like "Orientate". Oy.
@Azerrah Bless your soul.
Oh boy. 
@Remghar That'll work! ^.^
@Remghar Kingpin, with Woody Harrelson. It's a Farrelly Bros movie. Actually, any Farrelly Bros movie would suffice.
@TJSpanxx OMG, that's rough. Yes, I guess you more than know. /hugs to us both.
@TJSpanxx It's testing my patience, Spanxxie. But I'll survive. Strong like bull.
Check out this perspective. 7 million subscribers STILL for a TEN year old game. It's really a minor miracle. 
@strumpet101 Genuinely, a perspective that really hits home. Who would have thought it possible even 6 years ago, when it was at its "peak"?
@AbraxoCast You are absolutely right. Getting to that point is something that I aspire to but still struggle with.
@strumpet101 No kidding!
@strumpet101 He's such a cutie though.
@AbraxoCast Lol, true enough!
@AbraxoCast What's so awkward about that? :P
@MrsDeviantOne @zerena_hoofs I do remember you talking about the rice flower and shea butter smelling amazing!
@Faythemage Yeah, now you're talking. The panaderia is still open to grab some bolillos! (OMG, I'm hungry!)
@bldngnerd Tell it, man!
@MrsDeviantOne @zerena_hoofs No, I haven't seen it lately!
@Faythemage Let's make some tacos while you're here!
@zerena_hoofs Ich habe scheiße in meine hosen!
@Faythemage I love giraffe pattern, I have a Dooney wristlet like that and I regret never having bought a full size handbag with it!
Dear uterus: You will be departing soon enough, so must you make your remaining months as agonizing as possible? I'm almost out of narcs.
@MrsDeviantOne @zerena_hoofs Sweet,  keep me posted, I want some of that handmade goodness!
@MrsDeviantOne @zerena_hoofs Btw, are yours soaps up and running for sale yet?
@MrsDeviantOne @zerena_hoofs It wouldn't be in the community spirit to benefit someone else, Ging, come on!
@Gnoodles @zerena_hoofs YEAH, MAKE IT RAIN, BABY!!!
@zerena_hoofs So what you're saying is now is the time I should start my Blizzcon GoFuckYou... Err, I mean GoFundMe?
@Faythemage I just now noticed your avi... LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
@Faythemage @vacationmovie Right? Lord have mercy.
Chris Hemsworth and his... well, there's a cameo appearance in there, let's just say. NSFW. 
@MichaelJPetty @zerena_hoofs Haha! I was thinking Billy Idol, but we're on similar pages. :p (Don't hit us, Z.)
@fadedtimes Bone in is also my favorite, but hey... Boneless ribeye is better than no ribeye at all!
@zerena_hoofs nay
@fadedtimes Is that boneless ribeye I see?
@TheHordemasters @HarveyBurgess @tony_eight @AvionBlackstone @Rilandune @Turwinkle @DJSpinsStories TY! Have a nice weekend, all! #FF
@BloodHorse What a great story about a rivalry that I have fond memories of (I was an Unbridled fan).
@thewayitis1128 @halfemptyhunter @middlefingerBil @Jubafisher @KolbyPanda @C_Vanderlinden @twenty20sight @klonkadonk @Call_Me_Ep1c TY, hon!
@nodah18 @Taamyo @KtheGamergirl @m_sheena_ @ElisaAnttila @ccastro224 @__ashima @cukraan @reebok2099 Thank you, hon! Have a nice wknd, all!
.@latimes Still a better love story than Twilight. 
@XDeviantOnex Awww, I never played that one!
@XDeviantOnex @amazon I haz it! Willow is one of my favorites! I even had a husky I named Sorsha.
At least he took the time to respond and explain. @ABC7  
@ABC7Greg Thank you.
@ABC7Greg I appreciate you taking the time to respond. It was just so shocking. Perhaps a link w/warning about disturbing images next time?
@Alairthephoenix Exactly, it all has to do with good intentions. And yes, I found it strangely sweet and touching, too. :)
@AmoHeals Was it digits or letters, i.e. DD? ;)
@tankheals That would just be too good to be true!
@AmoHeals Maybe they're not "graduation" tassels. <DANCER>🏻
@dizthewarlock Ha, no, still at work!
@HalfZero Oh, God, I know, I have seen it, and sensationalism doesn't come close. It's like TMZ on steroids!
@Nightveil @ABC7 I can't imagine what that would do to parents, especially those who may have lost a child.
I guess it's true what they say, right @ABC7? If it bleeds, it leads. Smh.
Meanwhile, another reporter tweeting about the same @ABC7 story managed to use a barely more stomachable pic of the baby's footprints.
So, some slimebag reporter for @ABC7 decided to post a picture of a dead baby in a casket for a story about a reopened cold case. #poortaste
@ABC7JulieSone @ABC7Greg @ABC7 This is better than a photo of a baby in a casket. Please take note, Greg.
@ABC7Greg @ABC7 Did you actually post a funeral picture of a dead baby? Please tell me that's not what I'm looking at.
This just in: I think my ovarian dermoid cyst is using its teeth to chew on my large intestine. Ouch!
@AlternativeChat Hoping for the best for you all. Conservatives in any country are bad news. #yesIsaidit


Taking my work spouse out for her birthday lunch! (at @NormsRestaurant in Pico Rivera, CA) 
@nodah18 It's a fine line between hormones and which way the wind is blowing. ;) I'm cranky a lot but I rarely hold grudges, so don't worry.
@celeriekt Out of some of the people I follow, you seem one of the most innocuous, but I guess it's that ol' "to each, their own" thing. :p
@celeriekt I can't even begin to wrap my head around the thought that someone would mute *you*.
My boss almost used the F word today. If you knew him, you'd know what a big deal that was. He's so frustrated because we're overwhelmed.
@holykitt3n Good vibes for little TK. Hoping for the best.
@dizthewarlock I sure wish it could happen more in politics, we have so much more common ground than media would have us believe.
@Remghar Totally. I think I've learned it from facing that kind of behavior and how it stings sometimes, so I try to refrain.
@JennMorton01 I agree. When I had my cancer scare ethis year, I took every one of those prayers gladly. Any positive thought I could get.
@JennMorton01 I don't think we're alone. I think these voices are quieter than the ones who cause hurt or strife.
@nodah18 See, I'm not that scary! Just don't piss me off! :p
@Marathal_2_0 I like this. Just like it costs $0.00 to say "I'm sorry."
Consider my soapbox dismounted. And hey, this time it was something more positive, lest ye think I've become strictly maudlin these days.
In short, "To each, their own" and "respect" go hand in hand.
As evidenced by vitriolic arguments we see amongst "friends" on social media where open discourse, respect, and sharing don't always work.
With the caveat that others can do the same for me when I decide to lay my beliefs on the line. It's a shame that it's hard to do.
Btw, I threw that out there because I feel strongly that the beliefs and opinions of others should be respected even if I don't hold them.
@MichaelJPetty Yes. It's highly dependent on the person and their sincerity, but you know who means it well.
@klonkadonk I try my best.
@AbraxoCast Yeah, I can understand that. And raining on the parade of someone totally sweet is what I wanted to avoid.
@Tzeriel oops, I sort of misread that is Was it your obligation, but the answer is close enough.
@Tzeriel No. But it wasn't worth disrespecting it, especially well meant. To what end would that have served, save my own satisfaction?
Does that make me a hypocrite? I don't think so. I'm just not willing to ruin a sincere moment to let someone know MY opinion.
Because that was her belief, she meant what she said in goodwill, the least I could do is return that feeling in a way meaningful to her.
Did I tell her I didn't believe in God? No, I hugged her back and said "God Bless You, too." Even though it's not what I believe in. Why?
So, I saw her outside, and she said it was such a beautiful day, she had come outside to talk to God. She hugged me and said God Bless You.
I waver back and forth between feeling more like an atheist to being spiritual/agnostic. This lady, however, is very sweet, and a believer.
I had a heartwarming experience this morning with one of my coworkers, and it illustrates how deeply I believe in "To each, their own." (c)
@AlternativeChat You google "bacon birthday" and there's a boggling array of images.
@InternetEh I hate waiting for the attendant up there. I could have filled up and been gone thrice over in the time it took that dawdler.
@Ceraphus Happy Birthday! 
@MichaelJPetty You're certainly hitting a lot of the things I've felt.
@OBMiT666 Oh, that's terrible. Hopefully you'll get some relief soon!
@nodah18 But if I had to venture a guess, it's prolly because I'm not afraid to speak up if I don't like something, and I don't sugarcoat it
@nodah18 I'm not really aware that any genuinely are, although I wish more were, I maybe could get more cooperation around these parts.
Ah, that pleasant feeling when the Norco kicks in.
I give up. I will cry if it ends up a Clasico UEFA final because I don't think my heart can take it. 
@Jangosagony Yeah! I mean, it's just about the cost of one movie ticket if you do six months at a time. Still a great entertainment value.
@MichaelJPetty The no-flying is only getting old just now. Garrison burnout is big for me. And yeah, the story is not so compelling, IMO.
It's really a small dollar amount per month to be able to access my account whenever I do feel like doing something in WoW.
No matter what, 7.1 million subscribers is nothing to sneeze at. I'm still subscribed even though I'm not playing. 
@MichaelJPetty 
Crap. 
@TheLilianVoss @Osephala Sweet, thank you! I added it to my Sephora "loves" list so I won't forget it. I hate using benzoyl peroxide now.
Come on, Bayern, score that away goal.
@Osephala @TheLilianVoss Yeah, it's tough trying to combine anti-aging and anti-breakout products.
@Osephala Now that my middle aged hormones are out of whack, I feel like I'm 15 all over again. 47 and pimples. The struggle is real. :p
@Faythemage @Osephala LOL, dammit, Fay! #buffalobill
@Osephala You always look beautiful. I have a deep envy of your skin, not in a creepy way.
Bless her. I wish it hadn't taken me as long as it has to feel so free in my own body. 
I sure miss @Molsan and @SkolnickWho. Just saying so they might know they haven't been forgotten by people who enjoyed their company.
@ayligerwolf Hehehe. ;)
@InternetEh I saw it with my own two eyes. And they looked at me strangely because I was all bundled up like a SoCal wimp.
@thewayitis1128 Thanks, hon! &lt;3
@InternetEh Your shorts will be welcome there. But you must buy sandal socks to go with your mandals during little rain showers.
@lockrocks80 I'll tell him it's the song of my people. It's traditional, he can't get mad, right?
@XDeviantOnex That is this dude, for sure. He does the same thing in the lunch room, it's like he's a king holding court. He disgusts me.
(As you can tell, I'm in a baaaaaaad mood. I've become the office curmudgeon for the day.)
And we're sitting there, looking at each other, rolling our eyes, thinking, "Can we get our goddamned bagels and get back to work, please?"
Naturally, one of the managers, who's in love with the sound of his own voice, took 30 minutes on this ridiculous soliloquy. Please, dude.
That's a lie, I don't feel special, but I am hungry, so I guess this is as good as it gets.
Lol, the grand irony is it's Public Service Recognition Week. I had no idea since I missed Monday/Tuesday. We got bagels. I feel special.
@Wolfee27 Well, now that would sort of be like kicking a puppy.
This is fucking terrible. I donate to this place. Why would someone want to do something so cruel? 
@Wolfee27 You want me to punch you in the nose?
@celeriekt Why doesn't good stuff come in 3s, I wonder? It's like the bad stuff gets a quantity discount!
@Tzeriel LOL, that sounds right. I mean, I couldn't sound any worse with this cough and sniffle, but I still get the "chop chop, hurry up!"
I swear, I could punch someone in the nose today.
And yet the taxpaying public has the perception of civil servants being lazy sods without any sort of work ethic, cruising down easy street.
This is why being sick at this place never pays. The work and deadlines don't go away because there aren't enough people to take care of it.
At work in a fog, left my lunch at home by accident, and the case due tomorrow that my boss said he would take care of is still on my desk.
@eljeppy I swear, Jeppy, I have thought the same exact thing and said, "No, wait..." :p
@HalfZero Lol, right?
And I've been waiting for this moment, too. The "oh my god, what is that?!?!?" So anticlimactic.
Did my BF not notice his first earthquake? The non-terror of it all? :p 
@ABC7 @USGS Heard it more than felt it in Riverside (Woodcrest).
@AmoHeals Silly boy! Although it brings back fond memories of BC. Halaa was so fun!
Well, could have been worse, at least there's a crucial away goal as we head back to Madrid next week. #HalaMadrid  
@alice_the_malis Hold on a sec, we're over 40 but we're not dead yet.
Great way to lose, giving up penalties. 
@nighttimeapp PHX Sky Harbor is the devil's playground. The terminal layouts and the vast arrays of moving-walkways. Yuck!
@nighttimeapp That's genuinely the worst part. I was a pro, but it was still a tedious process getting through.
@MichaelJPetty organization and to see Jay, I racked up a few free flights. Because you purchase with points, and some were cheaper.
@MichaelJPetty No, they went to a points system based on dollar amount. I used my SWA visa to double that. So between travel for my prof.
I have absolutely no cross-country flights in my immediate future, and that is a wonderful thing. #tiredofairports
One of the habits I've still not dropped during the transition from LDR to living together is jumping at Southwest Airlines sale emails. :p
That's my boy. I so wish I was watching this with my Juve supporting Bossypants so I could rub it in. He hates CR7. 
@Nightveil Thanks, hon! I will do my best! &lt;3
@MarconinWoW Thanks, sweetie! &lt;3
@CasuallyCasual @Marathal_2_0 @MrsDeviantOne @ayligerwolf @wowmartiean That could be fun, or a pvp night.
@MarconinWoW Oh noes! Yeah? It's really bad timing. Hope you're on the mend, at least.
@Xandara Thanks, sweetie pie! &lt;3
That figures. Why they sold him, I'll never understand. 
Hala Madrid! #JuntosAPorLaUndecima  
@Rastailian Thanks, hon! I'm sure gonna try! &lt;3
May is not supposed to be cold and flu season, goddamit. #nyquil #bed #ZzzZzzzZzzz
@prettypaladin Yeah, I'd say that's a good summation of the problem. That's why I hope that the next one will be a bit more interesting.
@MissSalvira Indeed, my alts are barely touched after getting three to max level. All I do anymore are battlegrounds on the hunter.
@MichaelJPetty @wowmartiean Yeah, I'm disappointed because I was excited for WoD, but I feel no magic. But I'm by no means gone for good. :)
@MichaelJPetty @wowmartiean Too bad I can't hand you the keys to garrison-sit! :p
@ihealforfee Seriously, I feel there's never been a better time to be a PC gamer. The choices are amazing. I'm also a Civ series fan.
@MrsDeviantOne @wowmartiean Lol! It's a shame we're on this side of it instead of the happy-happy joy-joy side. But we're not alone.
@thewayitis1128 Girl, let me tell you, this battling thing, with getting the right team, is tough! Never dreamt it would be so complicated.
@wowmartiean I put in a blog post that I almost wish they had made them a guild perk instead of one per person. More community-feeling.
@thewayitis1128 the frustrated horse breeder I wish I was, but for money. Now I can breed and train, it really strikes a chord in me.
@thewayitis1128 Omega Ruby, and I want to finish the X game Jay gave me to start out on. I'm really enjoying it, but that's probably also
@wowmartiean I hate garrisons, too. Too many things are tied to them. I'll be much happier when we move on from that, I truly believe this.
Keep in mind, with a limited amount of playtime, I'm looking to have fun when I game. Maybe when I'm off this summer, I'll hit WoW up more.
@Jangosagony That's what Jay was telling me. I dread getting back to that one.
@wowmartiean Yeah, it's a shame. I felt the same in Cata. I fairly well enjoyed MoP and others didn't, so I guess it's very subjective.
@drewmgil Yeah, "meh" is a great word to describe it. I just take a taste of the new stuff and disappear again. :p
And we all know how appealing the shiny new toy can be.
It also doesn't help I'm in the grips of enjoying Pokemon, because learning the breeding/training/battling thing is completely new to me.
And hey, if you're enjoying WoD, that's great, I don't mean to take anything away from you. I personally am just getting little joy from it.
Last time I felt like this was, quite frankly, Cata, during which I took a several month hiatus. Hoping the next xpac is more compelling.
I haven't logged onto WoW for a couple of weeks, and probably won't until the new content patch drops. This xpac has just left me cold.
So, Children's Week in WoW did not happen for me, so Long Strange Trip achievement is postponed for yet another year. Oh, well.
With Jay, of course. (@ AMC Tyler Galleria 16 - @amctheatres for Avengers: Age of Ultron in Riverside, CA) 
@JennMorton01 @Leetawow This is true. I think I'm harder on myself than anyway. Thank you both, ladies. &lt;3
@Leetawow @JennMorton01 You both are very kind. I just feel like I'm always ill and therefore boring as a result, and it wasn't always so.
@RealTerrorwulf I'd rather not say here.
@RealTerrorwulf I love you too, baby. I'm just tired of feeling bad. I mean, look at the state of this.
@RealTerrorwulf Yeah, that too.
I am not everything I'm cracked up to be.
@pikestaff Well, without getting our hopes up too much, let's keep our fingers crossed, friend.
@pikestaff I hope so! I was 10 (yes, I'm old) for Affirmed, I didn't really get how hard it was. And I've been waiting ever since. :p
@pikestaff I know, and recently there have been a lot of close calls leading to disappointment. But I always hope. :)
Awww, it's so gratifying to see an emotional @jazz3162 in the winners circle. No better owners than him, @ZayatStables, and @JustinZayat.
Well, we'll know if this horse is the real deal in two weeks for the Preakness Stakes. Will this be the year?
The Zayats have been some of the most considerate owners with regards to their horses' welfare, and they've been trying a long time.
Excited at the prospect of #AmericanPharoah being as good as they say he is. Come on, Triple Crown. And no better owners than the Zayats.
@Remghar You know it!
Ah well, @Remghar, we were 3rd and 4th!
This is it! #KentuckyDerby2015
Whoever wins the #KentuckyDerby2015 I hope has the fortitude to win the #TripleCrown
Oh god, My Old Kentucky Home, cue the waterworks. #KentuckyDerby
@OrcaSOS I remember that tiny tank very well, I went to Marineland of the Pacific frequently as a child.

@Clairereds @Maruka1977 @btriordan @TheHordemasters @twenty20sight @Seetherwolf @Valomir @Rilandune @Lokax72 @miriimage haha, thank you! &lt;3
Thank you, @Dodge and @RamTrucks for actively marketing trucks to women! Lots of us drive one, it's about time.

@ABRLive @KentuckyDerby @NBCSN @ChurchillDowns An all-time favorite moment in horse racing, makes me tear up. Thanks for sharing it again.
The Kentucky "Hot Brown" was one of my favorite dishes when I visited Louisville. Cheese, bread, gravy... mmmmm! 
@noelove Cue Orc music from the lord of the rings soundtrack.
@Remghar Right on! I like Frosted, too, and an old horseman I used to know always said when in doubt, bet on the gray. Best of luck! :D
@gloriaboboria reamed for income in a certain tax bracket. I'm not exactly rolling in dough here.
@gloriaboboria work. It's crazy expensive here. Which I wish the IRS would have a cost of living adjustment by location so I wouldn't get
@gloriaboboria Yeah, the salaries do match up. What looks like a fat salary only affords a very middle class lifestyle about 45 miles from
This shouldn't make me laugh but it does. 
@Remghar Sweet! Should be a good race, maybe a new hero will emerge! :)
Nailed it! Now for tomorrow with my main pick Dortmund or my long shot Ocho Ocho Ocho in the Derby. 
@Remghar Other good ones are Materiality, Carpe Diem, Frosted, and American Pharaoh.
@Remghar This is a very good and tough field this year. My choice is Dortmund, but there are about 6 or 7 horses that could easily win.
@eljeppy Lol, oh my! That might be a little above and beyond the call of... appetite. :p
@eljeppy Lol, sorry! My only regret is I didn't bring more!
@prettypaladin And I thought we had reached the pinnacle with butthole bleaching. Wow.
@eljeppy No, but they're still very soft and squishy. ^.^
It may not sound great, but goat cheese on King's Hawaiian Rolls is absolutely the bee's knees!
@nodah18 I will. I usually only think of killing them while they're still in front of me and I'm still thibkjbg, "WTF is wrong with you?"
I wholeheartedly agree. And safe trip for all. #KentuckyOaks #LovelyMaria  
@nodah18 Now you know how my BF feels! It's a fine, fine line! ;)

/hug, friend!
@nodah18 I am violent! There are always people from other units which don't have as much work that want to dick around and waste time. :p
@nodah18 Have a good weekend, too. Yeah, we're having summer year-round now.
@XDeviantOnex To quote Sir Mixalot, "Unh, double-up, unh-unh."
@MichaelJPetty No, she just thinks she's hysterical, on a regular basis.
@XDeviantOnex That would do it!
She's lucky she didn't walk away with my government issued scissors embedded between her shoulder blades.
Let's just say she didn't seem to feel the hatred radiating from me as she walked away, still cracking herself up.
Today, someone walked across the building to disturb/interrupt my listening to say I looked like Princess Leia hair with the headphones on.
And, like many of you, I've experienced the violation of this virtual sign by people who are determined to interrupt and talk.
Like many of you, I wear headphones at work both to shut out distracting noise and to display a sort of "do not disturb" sign.
@XDeviantOnex Stop oppressing me and TELL ME I'M PRETTY!

@Mementh But not everyone likes the Oxford comma and will punctuate it like the original version.
@Mementh because it looks like you're saying Mandela is those things. Not that he's part of a series of things.
@Mementh Encounters with Mandela, an 800-year demi-god, and a dildo collector. If you're a believer in the Oxford comma.
@zerena_hoofs Girl, I give them more credit than the ones who care about Dancing with the Stars. Marginally.
@lockrocks80 I did smiling (my avi pic) and unsmiling. Smiling 26, unsmiling 43. Odd. But both are better than the truth! :p
@lockrocks80 You bitch, you beat me by 4 years! :(
@_Grimsley @tycertank Why, I don't know what you mean... **quickly deletes other people's pics off phone to hide evidence**
@mageic And start asking for those senior discounts! :p
@mageic I got 26 on my profile pic. And I swear to you I will never change it! :p
@tycertank @belghast I guess mom was on the right track when she'd say "Smile! You look like an old woman!" Ok, she didn't really say that.
LRT: helpless giggles at the appearance of Nelson Mandela being an 800 year old demigod and dildo collector. #oxfordcomma4life
@belghast Yes, I found a more serious pic and it pegged me at 43, only 4 years off as opposed to 21 years off. I need to smile more!
@tycertank I don't know if you've ever seen the Victor/Victoria film, but you were totally channeling your Julie Andrews in that role.

@lockrocks80 It is, and I have a day of meetings, too. Wish me luck!
Can there be a #blackpantsday in solidarity with those of us who struggle with their lady parts?
Of course, Mother Nature has to rear her ugly head and make me anxious about wearing anything but black pants. :-/
Yeah, I know the whole thing is about also wearing actual jeans, but it's hot as fuck, the hell with that. My solidarity only goes so far.

@zerena_hoofs @RealTerrorwulf Well, admittedly, we used it in a suggestive way in our jokes, but still, it's an eggplant.
It's a lucky thing me and @RealTerrorwulf met before sites started blocking the <AUBERGINE>! We'd never have been a thing! 
@Tzeriel @zerena_hoofs Lol, rock on!
@Tzeriel Oh yeah. Ok, maybe a shot.
@Tzeriel And you can jiggle my belly roll. And we'll still have a beer.
@Tzeriel The difference is you hate your body, and I've stopped hating mine, in a nutshell.
@Tzeriel stopped trying to lead as healthy life as we can, but it means we're ok with our bodies where we stop beating ourselves up over it.
@Tzeriel And that's great for you, but that won't work for all of us. And it's not celebrating, it's accepting. It doesn't mean we've
@Remghar Damn, I'll have to try again later for Double Jeopardy!

@Remghar Awwww, hugs!
(Is that the right answer?)
@Tzeriel That's true, but my opinion is I don't see the point in being negative to an entire movement if you only mean it for yourself.
@Tzeriel That's fine, and I salute your efforts. But please don't tell me that my positive body image, even obese, is not ok.
@Tzeriel Because I don't meet YOUR standard of fitness. Nah, bullshit. I'm ok being fat. If you don't like it, that's YOUR thing.
@Tzeriel This is where I feel compelled to say something. Who are you to tell me I can't feel ok about my body and say good enough?
@Remghar I'll take sympathy for $200, Alex!
@KelestiMMO @VeganRevoIution I just read through some of that mess this person spews about and I have no words except "idiot". Wow.

@zerena_hoofs @thebobbieoliver If there's one thing we can all agree on, a caged vagina is a sad vagina.

@FSUTJ @Wowhead Rock on! Best of luck to us both!
@FSUTJ Nice guide, I hadn't even looked. Lots of pets I'm missing, that'll be an added perk to collect them. Thanks for posting!
@FSUTJ That's the sad things, all of these world events I've had some achievements I got back in 2009, but never finished the meta.
@bldngnerd Although I do plan to explore a bit of the new content patch when it hits. This expansion has left me a little cold, tbh.
@bldngnerd I haven't been feeling it lately. My BF has been showing me how to breed/train Pokemon for competitive battling, which is fun!
@FSUTJ Tbh, I'm not sure. I'm trying to finish Long, Strange Trip this year, that's all I've been thinking about. :p
@C_Vanderlinden Yeah, it started yesterday, the clock is ticking!
@Tzeriel You're tough to the finish cuz you eat your spinach, you're Pervy the Sailor Man! Toot toot!
Also, I did not touch WoW last night despite my desperate need to get Children's Week done. Tonight, for sure. Honest. Maybe. Yes.
@bldngnerd Lol, me too, it's ok, they know us on this playground!
@bldngnerd Two men walking abreast! Har! 
@Tzeriel I do miss my spinach salads. A sad loss due to anticoagulant therapy. (Can't have high vitamin K foods because they raise clotting)
But, lo! A kindly coworker has brought in coffee cake. And I happen to have coffee. Seems meant to be. 
@bldngnerd Or I can grab some coworkers and do the Jerry Bruckheimer slow-motion heroes walking abreast scene.
@BSwitchCTR @MichaelJPetty Isn't that the truth. Mainly those who feel more polarized speak up; I do often wonder about the silent majority.
@bldngnerd Yes, please include scenes of me typing furiously, stapling papers, and doing a sideways slide up to the counter. :p
I always feel compelled to help out my immediate supervisor, though. He's a nice guy, very earnest and conscientious. And nervous. #yesgirl
So guess who's picking up the slack? Lucky me. I knew I should have stayed home today!
Today, I'm blindsided by the fact that the guy who was supposed to have it didn't show, and I'm the only one here from our crew.
So, yesterday, I had been blindsided by the fact that I had public counter duty because I failed to look at the scheduling calendar. Boo.
@lockrocks80 Thanks! My optimism is running high. :)
@lockrocks80 Seems to be, yes. Moving forward now, no more looking back.
@lockrocks80 Hanging in there, sweetest of sweethearts! Busy at work, busy at home, but things seem like they're settling in nicely now. :)
@MichaelJPetty Yep, just saw that tomorrow will be the 23rd anniversary of the "Rodney King" riots here in LA.
@lockrocks80 SPOILERS! Lol, j/k, I was just thinking of that whiny bitch, whatever the hell his name was.
@MichaelJPetty It seems to be that way, you're right. It's so disappointing that in 2015, we seem to be regressing instead of progressing.
@strumpet101 I've taken some surprisingly good shots on my phone. Pretty amazing, the technology in the palms of our hands.
@MichelleS_68 Aww, I fell asleep, but I'm still down!
And of course, they're not the only ones. I broke down and replied to one guy that the only thing missing from his avi was his KKK hood.
Does anyone doubt racism is alive and well when these comments exist under news stories? It's sickening. #Baltimore 
@MichelleS_68 Get ya some new ones, girl!
@MichelleS_68 We're all sort of like the Island of Misfit Toys. &lt;3
Lol, someone added me to their list "blood pressure." Bless you, bizarre denizens of Twitter.
@zerena_hoofs Awww, girl. I just got a bit riled is all. &lt;3
Jesus, my blood pressure. I need to go snuggle with my BF.
At least if you have to think that way because you can't help yourself, don't think you have to be the guy that has to "say it". Lackwit.
Anyone else wanna roll the dice? Because I am not in the mood for any more racist bullshit. The situation is bad enough.
@Zonkednerd I'm sure you are.
@Zonkednerd So is another racist. Maybe your turn will come at the hands of the cops whose dicks you're riding.
@Zonkednerd You tell me, bigot.
@Zonkednerd But keep telling yourself that.
@Zonkednerd He didn't deserve to die for it, either.
@Zonkednerd Like you're pretty much doing to African Americans. Buh-bye, bigot!
Straight up bigot right here. 
@Zonkednerd How is what I said "open season" on law enforcement? And why are their lives more important that they shoot first, ask later?
@Zonkednerd So if you're trying to make this a blanket indictment of the unrest caused by discrimination,put that in your pipe and smoke it.
@Zonkednerd There were protests. But I forgot white people save their rioting for sporting events.

@Zonkednerd All while he was begging for his life, saying he was sorry, and calling for his dad.
@Zonkednerd That's not entirely true. Kelly Thomas was a huge story and he was white but homeless when the cops beat the snot out of him.
@Zonkednerd And in a way, that's the most horrific thing, that you have to fear for your life being stopped no matter what. That's wrong.
@Zonkednerd You don't have to be a criminal to be stopped by the cops. Trust me.
@Zonkednerd I don't know if that's worthy of a death sentence.
@Katattakks The ones who get me are those who will only play with their fans for money. And if you give enough, you get their snapchat. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@Katattakks But yeah, that's like e-whoring, it gives the rest of us a bad image and a faulty expectation.
@Katattakks I wonder if it was the same one who was crying about losing her PayPal and now people could only buy her gift cards, boohoo.
@Katattakks I just saw a pic the other day where half the chick's head was cut off just so she could fit her cleavage in the picture. Smh.
@Nightveil Yeah, I do, too, now and again. I think I'm gonna work this Gwen Stefani angle for a while, sass it up a bit.
@Katattakks Remember when b0.obs were enough?
@Remghar I had to google it, I won't lie.
Just watching people follow and leave after a day if I haven't followed back. What, are they saying I'm not charming enough on my own? Pfft.

My Kentucky Derby "hunch bet". Even though odds, statistics, and history are against him.

@dancedj2k <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>Jesus loves me, this I know, for the U.S. Constitution tells me so.<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@RobCarome Lol, that is so true. They do that here, too. I'm sure ABC7 here in LA is disappointed that "American" is as close as we came.
Now here's a better story: how you can help. 
@RobCarome Right? I hate that. It's a tragedy, plain and simple. I hate it in Olympic broadcasts, too. I want to see the best, regardless.
Oh, I'm glad they clarified that there were 3 Americans dead, NOW it matters. Bullshit, who cares about nationality?

@zerena_hoofs LOL, wut?
I absolutely LOVE her trophy. 
@MissSalvira I love catching. And wonder trades. My BF had to sort of prod me to get started with training and breeding.
I have to laugh when doing these world event achievements, because I've had parts of them done since 2009. :p
@InternetEh Although, lately, our winters are like summers. :-/
@InternetEh It's sort of the "good weather" months. April is the start, and on over the summer. Not sure if it's different elsewhere.
But that ends when Children's week starts. Gotta get my achievement for Long, Strange Trip.
I have finally bred, trained, and leveled a Pokemon for competition. Having too much fun with this, I've kicked WoW to the curb for now.

@Zonkednerd I've known people who can't tolerate it, dizziness, vomiting, mood swings (in a bad way). Which does suck.
@Zonkednerd I can imagine that is a real thing, because people are allergic often to pharmaceuticals. I had a reaction to a BP med once.
@Marathal_2_0 Yes, please! &lt;3
@Zonkednerd There shouldn't be, it's silly. The narcotics I can take for pain are faaaaaarrr more dangerous and addictive.
@Zonkednerd And more. I use for 1, 2, and 4. 1, because all I can take is narcotic painkillers (yuck), 2/4 because no after effects.
@Zonkednerd Pain reliever (especially when you can't use typical), sedative (no hangover), appetite enhancer (chemo patients), sleep aid.
@FlyDraenei Lol! Right? It's genuinely elementary!
@bldngnerd Easy! Those feet are ticklish, I'll spill my wine!
You catch me on the wrong end of a week where I haven't been feeling well, I'm tired, and my patience has waned, and I am not a nice person.

@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel It's fine, no offense taken.
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel Sure, but a whole lot of people have their hands out for things we never asked for. I see Tzeriel's point completely.
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel I can respect that. But not everyone who wants to be paid full time for game content deserves to be paid for it, imo.
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel and it's more than the market can bear.
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel and sponsors to pay salaries and you get the content for free. Too many people want to do game content full time,
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel What if your free local TV channels asked you to pay for their content? They work full time. Instead, they use ads
@pinksyllibus @Tzeriel Not if they're asking me to pay them. If they're hired on by a company who pays them, sure. Ad-driven or whatnot.
@sha_doughstackz Geez, it doesn't seem that long ago I saw him here playing against the Galaxy. Time flies.
@sha_doughstackz Well, it's hard to tell when he's playing in the MLS because he doesn't have the same quality players to work with. Maybe.
@sha_doughstackz @NBCSportsSoccer It's football. And by MLS standards he's good, but he ain't good enough for Europe.
@NBCSportsSoccer Let's see, 0-0 aggregate, 0-0 at 88', second leg of UEFA quarterfinal... I think I'd celebrate, too. Henry is washed up.
@MeaganWoW I bet. I totally get that.
@MeaganWoW Ok, I shouldn't laugh, but I have to!
@MeaganWoW Yeah, following the local news channels on Twitter this past month has been an exercise in despair.
@MeaganWoW A true L.A. romance, lol.
@MeaganWoW Awwww! That's sad and romantic all at the same time. Yeah, I don't know what's going on right now, hopefully it settles down.
@MeaganWoW Oh geez. And these acts seem to be occurring at different times of day, can't just say "go in the daylight". Be safe as you can.
@MeaganWoW Yeah, there has been a lot of violence this past week. Keep your head down.
@zerena_hoofs @noelove Me! I'm already gimpy, I'll take the peg!
#JuntosAPorLaUndecima #HalaMadrid 
@SarahEd1981 Haha, you know it! &lt;3
And I'm home to watch it! 
Good luck, with that attitude. Because that gives me a hearty case of the "fuck you's".
I guess it's an indicator of modern society when well meaning, caring people are dissed in favor of those who'll give up the moola.
Yeah, I would offer words of encouragement, but then I saw the "cash only" sign. Sorry, fresh out.
@RealTerrorwulf Yes, I am. The last couple times I've rolled over have been calmer. There always just a hint of it, though.
@Alairthephoenix @noelove I have great hopes for this plan!
@NaerThePriest Happy Birthday!
@battlechicken Lol, good answer!
@thewayitis1128 Thanks, hon. It's crazy, I almost pitched out of the bed head-first last night.
Vertigo sucks. I rolled over and it took 5 minutes (or so it felt) for the room to stop spinning. Bullshit.
@Menniss_Madoran "You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge." Love this movie, too. :)
@FlyDraenei @lagerhoof You've got a pretty mouth.
@Hend_TTD Hend's Big Deck. I can see it. (Poor choice of words, but you know what I mean.)
@JennMorton01 I'm so sorry, Jenn. :'(
@fadedtimes @noelove Oh, of course, Sean. **knowing wink**
@fadedtimes @noelove Haha, noted!
@Nightveil You missed an older one (not a pic, just wildly inappropriate) that I shared yesterday to make my point about unwanted DMs.
@JohnnyFeisty @noelove @Hend_TTD @SaltySlainte A favstar doesn't do that quip justice.
@noelove It'll come in handy some day! No pun intended.
@Menniss_Madoran @noelove Like in the Untouchables: They bring a knife, I bring a gun.
@Nightveil Yes! But I've had mutual followers cross the line, I want to be ready to fight. (Needless to say they're no longer followers.)
@noelove @Hend_TTD @JohnnyFeisty @SaltySlainte I don't know, to me those were penises I would not want to meet in a dark alley somewhere.
Thanks to @noelove, I now have a supply of dick pix to send to anyone who sends me nasty DM's. Fighting penis with penis, that's how I roll!
Was it because of the food stamp challenge? 
@Hend_TTD @noelove @JohnnyFeisty @SaltySlainte I did, and I cannot unsee. While I appreciate their intended use, penises are ugly things.
@Alairthephoenix @Mementh That's the truth!
@stopthatmonkey_ Lol, I would say that's a safe bet!
@r9sid9nt9vil @ssmith0911 @Nonmail1 His whole inflamed sense of outrage was ridiculous. It's a TV show, not nuclear launch codes.
@InternetEh Very true. It's a matter of being respectful about other people's likes and preferences, instead of being a prat about them.
@InternetEh My response is usually along the line of "Well, don't fucking eat it then, I'm gonna enjoy mine." But I'm rude like that.
@TheDarcestheart @noelove That's weird! I've seen tweets suddenly appear in a convo that I somehow missed, maybe this is a similar issue.
@15minutegamer And what's sad is it casts a bad light on those of you fellas who can be fun and engaging but not pervy (unless a mild joke).
@belghast @Sabriality I can see why that would be. But I appreciate you and the men of Twitter who can have good fun and not cross the line.
@15minutegamer Yeah, it was brand new yesterday. But as I mentioned, it's opt-in, and the default is set to "off".
@15minutegamer that these guys should be outed for being gross without provocation.
@15minutegamer with Twitter's new "anyone can DM you", before we found out it was opt-in and we could relax. But I'm of a growing opinion
@15minutegamer Nah, but I put it out there yesterday because people were downplaying female concerns about what DMs they might face (c)
@belghast @Sabriality On several occasions. I wrote a blog post about it with other examples last year. Not all as gross, but still.
@Sabriality @noelove "Baby, how are you still single? Rawr."
@Sabriality I think I'm going to collect some of those dick pics and send them back to guys who get pervy.
@Alairthephoenix I think it's time more of us did. I used to have a different stance on that, but now I'm all for public humiliation.
@prettypaladin But I've come to recognize that there's no point in DM-ing that sort of thing, that these DM's are receptiveness indicators.
@prettypaladin The first convo I had with him, which was a few days prior, had been just about WoW and what classes we played, innocent.
@Sabriality Thanks, sweetie. For a while, I got a lot of this type of thing until I paraded the "I have a boyfriend" flag around. Dudes. Smh
@noelove He just needed a distracting chat. I wonder how the subject would have "popped up" had I not asked what was wrong?
@prettypaladin Dudes be gross. Which is why I'm glad the new "DM's from anyone" feature is opt-in.
@Alairthephoenix Well, never count them completely out. I don't act sexy or post boobs, so I don't know why I get it except I show my face.
@Hawgeye_ctr I'm having wheels installed so I can just roll around the 'Con. :p
@prettypaladin LOL, that must have been a sight! I hope it was at least a tagless T?
@Alairthephoenix I guess when someone has that "creep" nature, it's hard to suppress. And they're out there in vast numbers.
@zerena_hoofs Thanks, sweet baby Z!
@Alairthephoenix Oh, you had him? He had seemed like a cool dude at first, I considered maybe he was drunk or something, but still. Nope.
@Alairthephoenix Isn't it? I mean, what possesses someone to do that after claiming to want to talk about games? Yuck.
@ssmith0911 @r9sid9nt9vil @Nonmail1 That's true, you did! And the best way to prove he's not a rager is by posting another thread to rage!
@Miranda_Blu Happy Birthday! <BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER>
@ssmith0911 @r9sid9nt9vil @Nonmail1 I guess you're a dick because you didn't drop down to your knees and beg forgiveness. Lol, NOPE!
@thewayitis1128 Thanks! I pissed my knee and leg off at Costco on Sunday, and I walked a lot yesterday too. Needs a break before the shot. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@ssmith0911 @r9sid9nt9vil @Nonmail1 LOL, I've been watching this on FB, it's hilarious. Sort of like a jerk that got mad at Hobbit spoilers.
My favorite thing to do whilst playing hooky is watch horror movies until I fall asleep. I think John Carpenter's The Thing is the choice.
After all, it won't do to have this knee angry if it's going to have a needle poked into it.
I had so much pain during the night and slept so poorly, I think I'm going to pop a norco, get back under the blankets, and rest some more.
I got up with every intention of going to work half day and coming back for my orthopedist appt. But nah.
@jaygurrl No way, Jose! :p
Does everyone know it's @jaygurrl's birthday today? I think that needs to be on blast! Heehee!
@jaygurrl @Eojsworld @Marathal_2_0 To you? Well, Happy Birthday, then! <BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER>
Damn, I didn't even have to get a DM to get an almost dick pic in my TL. Sorry, @todthehippy, I am so not interested.
I am too lazy to delete and fix that typo. Fuck it. Live a little, right?
OMG, BBQ night here at the homestead. smelled so good I dove into it without taking a foodporn pic. Yeah, I'm sure that breaks your hearts.
@CasuallyCasual I thought you may have missed it, but I didn't want to try to intrude in your much needed time away!
Alright you clowns, time to head home to the BF. 

Already a month in and it's still sort of weird that this is true. But in a good way. :)
@XDeviantOnex I... Uh. Well.
@TakemikazuchAIE When the day starts off funky, I just don't have the drive to put it back on the rails. :p
@wowhuellhowser @Cole_Belle @disneygirl8 @Remghar **womp womp womp** I'm out. :(
@Hasteur @noelove @wowhuellhowser Ha, I had no idea, but it makes sense it would be a Monty Python thing.
@Hasteur @noelove @wowhuellhowser Haha, that says "Translate from Norwegian" underneath! :p
@Hasteur @noelove @wowhuellhowser I'm glad that's settled! Wait, wut?
@Cole_Belle @wowhuellhowser @Disneygirl85 @Remghar YESSSSS!
This has been a silly ol' Monday, hasn't it?
@noelove @Hasteur @wowhuellhowser <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@noelove @Hasteur @wowhuellhowser DAMMIT, NOEL! Oops, I mean, dammit, Noel!
@Hasteur @wowhuellhowser SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE!
@wowhuellhowser @Cole_Belle @Disneygirl85 @Remghar At the risk of saying something dangerous... You sound like you need more stimulation.
@jumperforce @EmrgencyKittens If I see anything like it on anyone at work, I'm going back home!
@Cole_Belle @Disneygirl85 @Remghar I've heard too many horrific things! And it's too bad because I like Norman Reedus. :(
@wowhuellhowser @Remghar @Disneygirl85 I was just re-listening to the audio books and I'm at that part now... Zzzzzzzz.
@Cole_Belle @Disneygirl85 @Remghar I have a confession, I've never watched TWD because I have an aversion to gore. #wimpy
Oh, no, that's not weird at all... &gt;.&gt; 
@Remghar @Disneygirl85 I wholeheartedly agree! Your kid could spoil it for you doing his homework! :p
This is true. The #Prado basin usually has water in it year-round. All those plants dried up and it's a tinderbox. 
@lagerhoof Yay! 
What, and put in real cheese instead of orange powder? The heck you say! 
@AmoHeals @lagerhoof Is that the Fonz as your avi? God, we ARE old!
@TJSpanxx Did I miss your birthday? Happy Happy!
@aerix88 @SouthwestAir They're my fave airline. Rarely delayed, low fares, bags fly free, and wifi for one price all day.
@Menniss_Madoran @lagerhoof Absolutely!
@lagerhoof And wait, is it your birthday?
@lagerhoof Welcome! I'd like to say we have cookies here, but we don't. We have Geritol and Ensure.
If you catch my drip... err, drift! That is all.
Second: I see jumpsuits are making a comeback of some sort. Which is fine for a 20-something bladder. Not a late 40's bladder.
First: Of course, there's nothing I want. Figures.
So, I see my favorite clothing store has $50 off a $100 purchase today (Lane Bryant, for you fellow big girls out there).
@Disneygirl85 @Remghar pitch a fit about Hobbit spoilers, and I'm like, the book was published in the '30's!
@Disneygirl85 @Remghar Which, I have a harder time being sympathetic about spoilers when there was a book first. Sort of like a guy I saw
@Disneygirl85 @Remghar I guess a podcast spilled some GoT spoilers. A person was listening on speakers and now coworkers are mad at him. :p
@Marathal_2_0 @RealTerrorwulf I need to slap a meter on him and monetize that! I'll be a gazillionaire!
@Marathal_2_0 @RealTerrorwulf Coincidence? I think not. Btw, love that movie, with young Steve McQueen!

@Leetawow @Ceraphus Now it's a party!
@Ceraphus @Leetawow I'll share the soap!
@Leetawow That's a Dr. Phil quote I can get behind! :)
@RobCarome My old friend used to say "Not everybody can be out of step but you." I repeat it like a mantra in case I get too cocky. :)
@FSUTJ LOL, no, it never happens here either. :p
@RobCarome LOL, that would be kind of sad!
@Lignar That's what I would imagine. If it meant it cost you a living, it might be one thing, but these shows are usually a labor of love.
@BaleyBlue Lol, it's true, I could almost hear the indignation. I wanted to comment but felt it best to sneak away and laugh, it was on FB.
@SaltySlainte Make it rain, baby!
@SaltySlainte And chicks!
@FSUTJ I guess this is true. I've stopped being a people pleaser because someone is always unhappy, hence my viewpoint is skewed. :p
@MichaelJPetty @Eojsworld Different take on a slip and slide, eh?
"You just lost me as a listener!"

"Um, ok. Bye."

Or is it just because I'm heartless?
If people are podcasting for fun, and you tell them you won't be listening anymore because of some affront, what difference does it make?
@JennMorton01 I'm in the same boat, just in a different way, so I completely empathize. /hugs and a congrats are both in order here. &lt;3
@JennMorton01 That's a relief. The surgery will happen when it will, but at least you don't have to worry about the C killing you first.
@Eojsworld Me either!
One year ago today, I was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and I survived. Get the facts of DVT/PE.… 
How ironic this story shows up today. 
@Eojsworld Did someone have Taco Bell?
@Atharia_Rose Thank you, sincerely. &lt;3
@Atharia_Rose Oh, that is so sad. I'm very sorry. Indeed, I just thought I needed a nap, or something to eat, or some relaxation. Who knew?
@Atharia_Rose If it hadn't been for that... who knows if I'd be here right now.
@Atharia_Rose Oh no, really? :( I was the same way, but my BF, who was 3,000 miles away, insisted I go to the hospital and get checked out.
And no matter how hard I've scoured this timehop app for clues, I've come to the conclusion I'll never have the answers I want for "Why?"
I certainly remember this from last year. What a life changing point in time for me and the people in my life. 
@Rhett_CTR @Remghar You poor schmuck!
@thewayitis1128 @ChicksLuvDaLock Right? And you know me, I'm a straight shooter, nothing I do implies I invite this sort of behavior.
@Remghar That's putting a Dick to good use! :p
Oh, Twitter friends, despite little moments here and there, you really do bring me joy. And lulz. &lt;3
@Rhett_CTR @Remghar @Moogyver I truthfully LOL'd at that!
@HalfZero Hahaha! Dude, you are too much!
@Rhett_CTR @Moogyver @Remghar Now there's a Dick I haven't seen in a while!
@Tzeriel @zerena_hoofs I had a bunch of different jerks for a while. One of which had his wife in his avi picture with him. Douchecanoe.
@HalfZero At ease'
@zerena_hoofs @Tzeriel Gotcha, bitch!
@wowhuellhowser @Remghar Looooooool! Although I think I see a hole in your birth control plan. :p
@wowhuellhowser @Remghar Aww, it's like a dick cozy. Put that in your Etsy store!
@zerena_hoofs He was trying to distract his mind! Lol!
@UnholyAlliances Or fear of light sabers applied a la Lorena Bobbitt!
@zerena_hoofs Sick fucker!
@Remghar @wowhuellhowser What? That must have been inspired!
@ChicksLuvDaLock That's what he gets, the perv! :p
@Remghar That was a lot of rhyming! Here then, is my first installment for all the world to see! 
@eevalution Definitely. It hasn't been bad lately, but then I wear a flag that says "taken" in my Twitter bio. Like you need a disclaimer.
@Remghar OMG! What if creepy women send you dick pics? Deal breaker? ;)
@Remghar Ain't that the truth? If it ain't broke, yadda yadda yadda.
@Remghar The concern, or what I can tell, is will it stay opt in.
@Remghar They made it a thing where you can opt in (for now) to get dm'd by everyone. Not just mutual followers.
@Osephala That's why I was laying down the law. He said he wanted to talk about games, but this wasn't a game I was interested in.
@wowhuellhowser Where who why what when?
@Osephala Right? I mean, what nonsense. I just wanted to distract myself, indeed.
@Tainothetank Hahaha, oh boy! You must be like <NEUTRAL FACE>
@Zonkednerd Hey man, it doesn't sound selfish. I decided not to have children because I wanted to enjoy my life. Eff that noise! :p
@Kritty_Cat Well, I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. But I've seen FB suddenly change things from opt-in to opt-out.
@Zonkednerd That's what I tell people. Stop looking. Be friends with people, one of those could be the one.
@eevalution I have no doubt it does. And that's kind of sad, isn't it?
So I can understand why a lot of women will have legitimate concerns about this DM thing. Guys should, too. Anyone can be gross.
And I don't hang my tits out or flirt or look for that kind of attention. Never have. Wasn't even looking for a BF, just happened upon one.
But if I got messages like this from people who were mutual followers, I shudder to think of the randoms. 
If it's not the default and you have to opt-in, that's better than nothing, but you know how social media sites love to change the rules.
I wrote this last year, but in light of the Twitter #DM thing, it's relevant. "Don't Creep on Me, Bro...

@lockrocks80 I love you too, so let me send you THE nudes! At least you don't want money. 
That moment when you see something that really makes you want to say "Fuck you. Please let me know how I came to owe you **anything**."
@Faythemage Oh, Fay, hang in there. All prayers and positive thoughts for him, and you.

A horse owner's greatest nightmare. This is far enough away not to be a threat, even though ash is dropping here. 
It's already that time of year? 
@thewayitis1128 Especially since jockeys and trainers are the real horsemen, they feel for the animals they work with, it's not just money.
@thewayitis1128 But it's always so sad to see a jock walking back with the saddle of his stricken mount. Such an eloquent image.
@thewayitis1128 He stumbled out of the gate and seemed to tweak his true knee, which is called the "stifle". Not life or career threatening.
Looks like my bestie is having fun at #StarWarsCelebration!  
This is the saddest photo after so much promise and anticipation. Luckily, Shared Belief doesn't seem in danger. 
Struggling right now, like in a weird way. It's just the more things change, the more they stay the same.
Hopefully a precaution. #SharedBelief  
I had that feeling of misgiving. I hope #SharedBelief isn't injured, at least not badly.
Oh no! :( 
@Vikirnoff I feel your pain, believe me! &lt;3
Such a beautiful horse. Wishing him a safe and successful trip. 
@Mominatrix75 I know! I had been set on the Hemi orange, but that black one with the red stripe... meow.
@Vikirnoff Why can't people say it's not their personal cup of tea but not make it sound like you're mentally deficient if you like it?

@FaytTemple @RealTerrorwulf Likewise!
I guess keeping my place in the waiting room payed off. Tickets still say unavailable and not sold out, so hang on if you're still stuck.
@Tzeriel @ShaofHappiness @RealTerrorwulf You should see these speed-bags, too! ;)
@TheMagesTable @RealTerrorwulf LOL! Takei, oh myyyyy!
@ShaofHappiness @RealTerrorwulf Not really, he (playfully, of course) threatens a "boob punch". :p
@RealTerrorwulf Well. Uh. How do you mean that? It may or may not be a bad thing!
@Tahuuharuk Thank you! Only took a half hour. 0.o
LRT: After ticket confirmation, I faked out @RealTerrorwulf to think I had failed totally. I think I have a spanking coming my way.
It took a half hour in the waiting room, but I'll be taking @RealTerrorwulf to Blizzcon this fall after all. Thank god. I have a headache.
EUREKA!
@dizthewarlock @DarkmoonHerald Yeah, it's just that now my BF is out here, I really wanted to get a ticket for him, he's never been.
@khuruuk @AmoHeals Great. Probably too late now.
@AmoHeals @khuruuk Me too! When do you say when?
And Chelsea scores over Man Utd. Bad omens abound.
@DarkmoonHerald Boo! You too, huh?
Still in the waiting room. I've got a bad feeling about this.

@prettypaladin Horizontal is good, though! Try to rest, poor thing.
@prettypaladin Woman, lie down before you fall down! Seriously, though, feel better soon.
@Ayrwalker Oh, that's a good tip! Thanks for that! :)
@zerena_hoofs Damn, dude. Is it dank and sticky?
@CasuallyCasual And yes, garrisons are killing me. I mainly PvP now that I run a hunter. That's fun, at least.
@CasuallyCasual I've been seeing that! Looks interesting. I bought it when it was on sale super cheap a while back, but never downloaded it.
@CasuallyCasual Fun!
@CasuallyCasual Thanks, mama! I saw your new podcast announcement, btw! Excite!
@Ayrwalker Well, at least that's something, but it had better have a decent conquest award to be all that trouble, I should hope?
@XimVewDew I know. It was bad enough when they relegated conquest to events only, now this?
Can anyone tell me what the point is now? Besides collecting bones for your sanctum, assuming anyone is out there. 
@icywiz Lol, thanks! Just speaking from experience. Err, I mean, a friend's experience. Yeah, that's it. :p
Oh sure, we text first. To demand "Why the hell haven't you texted me?!?!" 
@TheManWhoGames0 It was pretty funny. Autocorrect betrays us at the worst times!
@TheManWhoGames0 Freudian slip?

@BaleyBlue Thanks, hon! I still struggle to reconcile all the things that have happened over this past year. As you can see. &lt;3
And thus one of my everyday struggles: accepting the reality that is. The good and the bad. #babysteps
Life just throws a whole lot of weird shit at you. No warning. Maybe it's fruitless to wonder why things happen, just accept that they did.
So, do things happen for a reason? Would they've happened the same if nothing bad had happened to be the catalyst? I guess I'll never know.
But despite all the bad stuff, a lot of positive change came out through the aftermath, and not just for myself.
I know at the time I wished this was true, and in some ways, I still do, healthwise. 
Wow. Well, now I know where it comes from. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

So, that went poorly. Were it me, I would have started Cozmic One in the fall. I suspect late bloomer like his dam.

Legal and legislative training, and we can't grammar properly. It's "imposed". ImposeD! Why does this happen so much? 
LA County Supervisors Solis, Kuehl, and MRT's reception for Assessor Jeff Prang. (at @NextDoorLounge) 
@alice_the_malis I am. My body just won't cooperate with my youthful thoughts anymore! :p
@bldngnerd Cheers, my friend!
Omg, I can't believe I used to drink doubles!
Hello, vodka/7. It's been a while. You used to treat me so well in the old days. Will you still?
@alice_the_malis Yes, it's hard for me to accept. But I'm doing my best to hold onto my youth!
@nodah18 LOL! I'm not going to that kind of party! :p
@alice_the_malis Same with Cali. I keep facial sunscreen on always and wear a visor when in serious sun. I'm doing good for 47.
@nodah18 Lol, yeah, my cheeks!
@alice_the_malis After all, they have women moisturizing all the time, my skin makes its own moisturizer. :p
@alice_the_malis Most of the ethnic women (like me) that I know have oily skin and don't look their age. And stay out of the sun.
I guess a Starbuck's napkin will have to do! #badlifehacks
Good god, I know I should thank my oily skin for keeping me wrinkle free, but not when I forget blotting papers! #shiny
@JohnnyFeisty They look like scones. I guess the recipe isn't so different, though.
@Wolfee27 I don't know, I kind of like it that way. Keeps me focused on what really matters, and not in a fantasy world.
@Wolfee27 Ah, games are just games. I don't take them or the things surrounding them seriously. Real life trumps all.
@zerena_hoofs Thanks, baby Z! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@zerena_hoofs I'm going to try to get some because Jay's never been at all, but we both agreed if that doesn't happen, we'll still meet up.
@HalfZero It is, I know. I mean, for what you really get out of the actual 'con. I think for me it's really seeing people I've met here.
@zerena_hoofs Yeah, I still want to see you guys, and the BF has never been to any of it, regular or after party.
@HalfZero @BlizzCon Oh, noes!
@Wolfee27 The perils of holding an office in my union.
But you'd better believe I'll be trying on Saturday morning. Even if I'm unlucky, I live close enough to come to the after-hours stuff.
Good luck to those trying to buy tickets. Unfortunately, I have a must-attend political event tonight. #badtiming 
However, the three guys from the lifeguards' union: straight out of Baywatch. 0.0

@thewayitis1128 Thanks, sweetie! &lt;3
Man, I sure wish I'd had my roots touched up last week instead of this coming Saturday. #snowypeak
@jaygurrl Estrogen Powah! :p
I've got my war face on. Time to go make a splash with the big boys. 
Chromie's like a California Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Looks lovely training in the UK! 
Tax day and bill day are one and the same. I do like that you can file for an IRS extension online by making a payment. Saves a stamp.
@MichaelJPetty @Eojsworld Perfect!
That'll work. Let's see what happens on the next leg at the Bernabéu! Hala Madrid! 
Isn't there something behavioral to do with grandiosity?
Man... 

@Tzeriel tricking my body into thinking it was pregnant with artificial hormones. It's no wonder I'm a hot mess in the peri-menopause years.
@Tzeriel It's possible, for sure. My weight gain started at puberty, I always suspected hormones to be involved. And then 20+ years of
@Tzeriel I don't know if it's that or the ebb/flow of hormones since I've been on depo injections. I just know cold nipples are no joke. &gt;.&lt;
@Eojsworld Oh, that would be creepy!
@XDeviantOnex Lol, that's what she said!
@XDeviantOnex Haha, omg, perfect!
@lockrocks80 Snuggles!
@Eojsworld @MichaelJPetty Yep! It's a big deal for the County. All departments and districts are having it today.
@NotAnna Fancy!
@nodah18 Never hurts to start early! With safety, I mean.
@NotAnna Especially my stapler! I guard mine with my life. They "disappear" frequently.
@Eojsworld @MichaelJPetty Between this and Bring Your Brats to Work Day, this place is in an uproar today.
@nodah18 See next tweet.
I wish with all my heart I had some condoms in my purse. That's what I would give them. Just for shits and giggles.
Oh boy. The Whelps at Work are having a scavenger hunt. We were told that if a whelp approaches us asking for an item, to please give it up.
But you'd better believe that when I say "Hala Madrid", I mean my boys in white, @realmadrid!
@MissSalvira Oh good grief! You must have been a Popsicle!
UEFA Champions League quarterfinal coming up, and it's a Derbi Madrileño. Hard to say "Hala Madrid" when both teams are from Madrid.
@MissSalvira Yeah, there's one not too far from me. My poor boss has one over his head in his office. He keeps a jacket handy.
@MissSalvira Thanks! It's mainly at work, I don't know how people stand it. I have a little heater under my desk. :p
@thewayitis1128 I'm of an age where I have some of those moments, but work a/c just kills me!
@InternetEh I just scrolled back and read. That's great! Congratulations and best of luck when the journey starts! Yay for no dysentery! :p
I think there's a misconception that us fat folks are always hot and sweaty. I am fucking freezing, despite my insulating layer of blubber.
@Juunoswow I'll still come by for the parties even if I don't get tix! The people are who I want to see most, anyway.
This #GoogleDoodle #PonyExpress game is kicking my ass!
@Juunoswow I hope you get it sorted out in time, sweetie. I'm going to be missing Wednesay's onsale, gonna try for Saturday. Best of luck!

@JennMorton01 That's what I believe. Sometimes those actions can be very telling.
@Juunoswow Good grief. At least they could have tried something better if they're going to put you through this.
I was in a hurry to get away from everything associated with this, but this was the flight that allegedly did me in. 
@XDeviantOnex 
@XDeviantOnex Good lord. Never even thought of that! Begone, foul plague-bringers!
@BaleyBlue Yeah, there tons of them zipping around, squabbling over nests. They're fun to watch from the break room!
@Juunoswow Oh no! That sucks!
@shizukera Awww! What a cutie!
It's like a scene from The Birds outside right now. Dozens of swallows building nests. Watch your heads! 
Swallows building mud nests on our office building. 
@Nightveil Dude... Truly.
@shizukera Yes! We were inseparable buddies, along with a small pack of dogs that trailed around after us. Good memories. :)
@Heronymus @zerena_hoofs Hahaha!
@zerena_hoofs Jesus christ!
@RoseNobs /highfive!
@shizukera You're absolutely right, entrepreneurship is tough. It was an interesting place to grow up, though. Just me and my horsie.
@MichaelJPetty Lol, yeah, it's crazy!
@shizukera Mine bought a restaurant/travel stop on a highway, But there was a recession (80's) and high gas prices, and they went bankrupt.
@shizukera I feel you on this. I grew up much the same after age 11. Nearest neighbor was 3 miles.
@Tzeriel Haha, great visual!
@NotAnna Those I would have enjoyed!
@RwEightyFive @the_cajungeek <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
@RwEightyFive They'll be mounting crucifixes on their monitors, LOL!
@the_cajungeek @RwEightyFive I pity our IT Help Desk today. Someone needs to send them coffee.
Can you tell I'm not the maternal type? :p
Fuuuuuuuuu.... I forgot it was Bring Your Snotty Whelps to Work Day, too. Great. This will certainly compound the misery.
@RwEightyFive Haha, good call! It might as well be black magic, while we're at it, considering how much fear it's evoked!
Which is ridiculous. I'm old as fuck, and I get it. Of course, some of my peers are considerably older. So much consternation though.
Ah, the much dreaded conversion to Office 2013 and migrating our email to the cloud. Many of my coworkers don't know what a cloud is.
And if you don't know that quote, I'm not sure we can be friends.
There was a bunny by my door as I was leaving. I actually told it "Be cool, honey bunny." It hopped off a couple paces but, overall, cool.
@restokin @Maruka1977 @ayligerwolf This is true. I used crafted and pvp pieces along with ilvl 600's I got through instance leveling.
@strumpet101 Thanks, Christine! I had a very lovely day! &lt;3
@AbraxoCast And right now I fight her because she wants to bring stuff into my house now that she's here. So, I completely empathize. Sadly.
@AbraxoCast The struggle is real. My mom hoards. She gets mad when I donate my clothes because I spent good money on them. I could go on.
@AbraxoCast Sounds like my mom. A $5,000 treadmill. A $700 blender. Then complains she has no money while these items collect dust. Smh.
In a move of sheer genius (lol, sure), I rationed my coffee. Drinking some now so I have some chance of not falling asleep behind the wheel.
@Katattakks /hugs to you and your family. Hang in there friend.
@Xolosfrosthart Way cheaper than Alienware, no bloat ware, and you can pick almost any mobo/graphics/chip/components/case you want.
@Xolosfrosthart I had my last two PCs built by Cyberpower PC. You can pick your parts, all non-proprietary, so you can repair/upgrade oyo.
@Mementh Thanks. /pet
@Rastailian @TheMagesTable Lol, cute! I think it may have!
@TheMagesTable @Rastailian You and your bear butt! (See what I did there?)
@Rastailian That's a shame. I've never seen you say something out of place, unkind, or hurtful. I'd say the loss is theirs.
But I do remember how many of my Twitter friends were there for me, with advice or even just offering a hand to hold. I won't forget that.
And it was because of this that I have an almost visceral reaction even thinking about Pax East now. It was really that awful.
This was a terrible day filled with disappointment, anger, hurt, and fear. So many feels. 
@XDeviantOnex Hahaha, true enough!
@XDeviantOnex I'll bring the butter!

Wait... Is "syrup" a euphemism here?
@XDeviantOnex Too many pancaked people! :p
@XDeviantOnex LOL! Just about! The real problem is when you're turning right and one of those last-second dorks jumps into the crosswalk.
@emmarium @Leetawow Thanks, sweetheart! It was very nice, indeed! &lt;3
Good! I'm sick of dodging pedestrians who pull this shit. If I have to wait, so can they.

I'll be back later, @RealTerrorwulf is going to show me how to breed.

Pokemon, duh. Pervs.
@HildaCupcakes Congrats!
@tomahawks @History_Pics Seriously?
@Faebelina Pick me, pick me! lol!
Because it's human nature not to accept that things just randomly happen sometimes.
Since I still have no definitive answers, and what with hindsight being 20/20, I will be scouring my Timehop for signs I obviously missed.
This was before Pax last year. How could I have known what was to follow in the week to come? 
@brumfondl @Kell__KT Haha! Totally! I can't really justify making it into a General Lee. :p
@brumfondl @Kell__KT I even have my paint job picked out! 
@thewayitis1128 Thanks! Just Children's Week and Midsummer festival to finish up the Long Strange Trip and get my protodrake! ^.^
@brumfondl @Kell__KT Hahaha, no lie! Still haven't paid off my Hyundai! But a girl can dream, can't she?
Birthday's coming! Just sayin'... 
@Mementh Thanks!
I just earned the [Noble Gardener] Achievement! #Warcraft 
@Tzeriel I believe this, too. We're all on the take, getting fat pensions, and other misinformation the media likes to spread for headlines.
@Tzeriel Well, you do have a point with that. I just hated it when one of the papers made it a searchable database. Why not just position/$?
I understand for elected officials and big wigs who get "bonuses", but salaried, non-management level employees? Come on. It's a j-o-b.
Because working for a public agency means your info is owned by the public and you have no right to privacy.
Why don't you just print my SSN in there too, save identity-jackers the effort?
Ah the press and the Public Records Act, where they can gather and publish all public employees salaries and compensation by employee name.
Sometimes when I see inflammatory tweets, I want to RT them and say, "Discuss", and let Twitter handle the rest. But even I'm not that mean.
Hey, @UnholyAlliances! 
@zerena_hoofs Ah, dumb ol' Theon. His plans really backfired on him.

Hey @RealTerrorwulf, will this be my engagement ring when the time comes? 
@Xolosfrosthart Haha, tell it to my aches and pains! ;)
@Xolosfrosthart My number is starting to get scary, I'm on the downhill slide to ancient! :p
@Xolosfrosthart It's true! Although I've reached the age where I don't look forward to them as much.
@Xolosfrosthart That's why you followed me back, we're birthday buddies! Mine's on Sunday, too!
@Xolosfrosthart Well, welcome back! :)
@Xolosfrosthart I know you were, too. That's strange. I've heard people complain about random unfollowing, maybe that's what happened?
@Remghar I do! Because I think we've both rolled our eyes at the same crap we see in our feed. :)
@ScottLeyes @Remghar Siblingist? Only-childist? Brother can't be sexist if you're both men can it? Let me ask a feminist!
@ScottLeyes @Remghar Bigot! <WINKING FACE>
@Remghar BRB, I'm going to write an outraged blog post, k? Followed by a gofundme for the new Only-Child Empowerment Fund! :p
@thestartingzone Nope. $20 for 30k or less of gold just isn't worth it to me. And I'd rather keep the gold I have.
@MichaelJPetty Hahaha, nice!
@noelove AND YOU DIDNT ASK HIM IF HE NEEDED HELP WITH HIS MEAT???
@MichaelJPetty Oh geez! That sounds like something my mom would say, "Wow, how tall are you?" Without thinking you might be sick of it.
@HalfZero It takes a constant effort to remember to sit up, it sucks!
@MichelleS_68 I'm a first world kind of girl, what can I say!
@Mominatrix75 Lol, no doubt! I like your avi pic, btw! :)
Now here's the fucking truest of truths. 
@MichaelJPetty Boys in school are bad enough, but you figure they're kids. That Reddit thread though... these are men teasing minors. Gross.
@FlyDraenei yeah, it's better when you know you're not going to get a "nice hoodie, mami."
@NotAnna Totally. It feels like you're trying to advertise them. I try to sit up at my desk, but in public, I get uncomfortable and slouch.
@gloriaboboria Yeah, because it's confusing and actually frightening at that age, when you're not really sure what's happening.
@Remghar I stand with you, Rem! These siblingists make me feel bad, and I'm not going to take it anymore! Only-children deserve recognition!

#OutrageCulture
@NotAnna Yep! It's like you're trying to draw your boobs back into your chest.
@FlyDraenei Right? You just want to be left alone. The only skirts/dresses I wear are the maxi style, right down to my ankles.
@NBCLA And this is a relevant question because it shows how out of control these "officers" were, that they didn't even notice a chopper.
@NBCLA Yeah, what kind of officers are they training that are that stupid to beat someone who is subdued with a news chopper overhead?
@klonkadonk I know I couldn't. No way. If they can't ask me straight up, I don't want to hear the question.
So guys, don't fool yourself that chicks should find any kind of attention flattering. From cat calls to creepy DMs. It's not flattering.
The habit I still can't break is rounding my shoulders, slouching to hide boobs. When I sit up straight, I feel like I'm sticking them out.
Which is why you won't see me flashing my shit all over social media or a stream. I hated that kind of attention and still do.
I guess things haven't changed much from when I was a 13 year old who developed a D cup. Guys can be disgusting. 
@nodah18 Me too, in the afternoons when it's hot out, but I was a little chilly this morning.

@Xagnut_CTR @noelove Sadly, I don't. I'm not fond of lengua, tripas, or trompas (pig snouts).
@HalfZero With any luck!
@Mementh Yeah, totally. I did a double take!
@Mementh It was normal, but I've never signed it before. A pass-through of members' health insurance premiums to the insurance company.
@InternetEh I agree!
@InternetEh Right on! I'd be down for that. She was a great lady in a historic position as the first female Chief of the Cherokee nation.

@Tzeriel @zerena_hoofs Oreos?
@zerena_hoofs Yeah, a mutual friend said she'd gone on a blocking spree, and I checked, and I was included. Absolutely no clue why.

@Remghar @AltheMage Happy Birthday!
@Remedeezy That is awesome!
@KrisAhlman @AlternativeChat Anything on the west side, really, but the 405 is murder. I hate my 60, but I'll take it over the 405 and 10.
@JulesRPG Thanks, Jules. It's either that or let myself become toxic because of it, and I refuse to be that person. :)
@KrisAhlman @AlternativeChat Ah, a fellow enraged driver! Welcome! :p
@JulesRPG No one does. I felt sort of obligated to hold on, then I realized the impact it was having, and it's not worth it. Sad, but true.
@bldngnerd Haha, that's ok, I'm grumpy most of the time, too.
@bldngnerd How about "that make you consistently very angry"?
Some people you just have to distance yourself from in order to keep your sanity. Especially when their behavior makes you so very angry.
@UnholyAlliances LOL! Where's my Grumpy cat "No" meme when I want it?
@76ModelMike @zerena_hoofs What has been seen cannot be unseen.
@InternetEh "Fools" seems fitting.
They do this randomly and without warning, to try to catch us at... what exactly? Being present without an ID? Oh, spank me, I've been bad.
Every now and again, our HR department descends upon our district office from downtown to check our IDs. Really? Like, who's impersonating?
@zerena_hoofs @76ModelMike I was trying to explain it to someone the other day and ended with a lame "you had to be there". :p
Hey @zerena_hoofs @76ModelMike, remember this convo (courtesy of @timehop)? 
@RealTerrorwulf @manabrownies It always is, my love. It always is.
@HildaCupcakes @prettypaladin That figures! :(
@prettypaladin @HildaCupcakes Me too!
@nodah18 You've seen their building over there in Corona, haven't you? Off the 91 near McKinley?
@nodah18 You shoulda tried some of that Vietnamese instant coffee. Kick like a Texas mule.
@nodah18 Why, did you need something?
@HildaCupcakes :(
@jeanbees I love that red!!!
Me with tapioca pudding. 
@nodah18 For a bit longer, trying to get some Noblegarden cheeves, working on the Long, Strange Trip meta.
@MichaelJPetty Grats!
@manabrownies Haha! Wishful thinking for now! ;)
I just earned the [Blushing Bride] Achievement! #Warcraft 
So, through the token system, I think I know which of you not to ask for advice on my 401k!
@NotintheAsylum @holybatgirl Agreed!
@NotintheAsylum @holybatgirl In general, seems like the more you ask people to refrain from bad behavior, the angrier they get.
@holybatgirl You're absolutely right. It's not ok. At least they're going to prosecute this officer for murder. A small step.
@holybatgirl For the many ways we are advanced here, socially and morally, we're a bankrupt culture.
@NotintheAsylum @holybatgirl It sometimes feels the world is going backwards. And the more you try to fight it, the bigger the backlash.
@holybatgirl The more you try to point it out, the more defensive people get whilst they stereotype all the harder.
@AbraxoCast I like the Radius toothbrush (has a large brush) and about the only place I could find it was Amazon, so I ordered a bunch!
@Ashayo I had the best mental image/audio of this, too! :)
@Ashayo Do they have the same soft-voiced gentleman from snooker tournaments giving the play by play of the restart? ;)
@nodah18 Aww, that's a nice thing to say!
@nodah18 It is if I don't want to fall asleep and get in an accident on the way home! I've had a couple of close calls.
@nodah18 Goddamn, this stuff is crazy. I'm probably going to be wired out of my mind.
@Manglehaft @Ceraphus Would they be glitter feces? (Fairy, after all.)
And that's a thread I don't want to break because I've got all sorts of words, most of them unkind, that are rattling about in my head.
I'm so sleepy that my productivity is zero and my mood is hanging by a thread.
I'm turning to Vietnamese instant coffee to try to stay awake. 
@XDeviantOnex @MrsDeviantOne @ellellesays @clockwork_bells @Zuulzilla @twenty20sight @tempusfrangit @cyberwaif I saw that on FB! Adorbs!
@apsana @Remedeezy @Bluefer2 Well, you're still fantastic anyways!
@Remedeezy @Bluefer2 @apsana That would be fantastic!
@Bluefer2 @Remedeezy Definitely!! A 3-woman ding-fest. Which somehow sounds wrong, but you know what I'm saying! :p
@Bluefer2 @Remedeezy NO WAY!!! That is quite a coincidence indeed!
@dancedj2k @Remedeezy Thank you!
@Remedeezy Great minds! :D
@Remedeezy Ha! Mine too! Birthday sisters!
@Remedeezy Wait... THIS Sunday?
The struggle is real.
@Rischerion <EYES>
@Hend_TTD Oh god! Sorry!
@AlternativeChat Haha, perfect. And let's just leave Jamie Lee Curtis out of it, the gold digger! :p
@AlternativeChat When can we start trading futures? ;)
@Xandara @Hend_TTD That's what's weird is they set a gold cost but market economies will eventually change it. Why set a benchmark, then?
@Hend_TTD Haha! Totally!
@Sigtric @Girl_Grey But in all the right places, I'm sure. ;)
@Hend_TTD Yeah, I don't really think it's worth it at all. Like, if I wanted to buy the Alliance bike, $60 +/- would be the exchange. Nope.
@Girl_Grey @Sigtric Girl, just remind me never to get on your bad side! <COLLISION SYMBOL>
@Sigtric @Girl_Grey I had to stalk you just to see what prompted that outburst.
@jaygurrl Lucky! I'm in a cube. <PENSIVE FACE>
@jaygurrl **look furtively around** Right?
@lockrocks80 Haha, pretty much. Although I feel a bit like the guy on the right.
@elepheagle @Tzeriel @holykitt3n Lol, thank you! It's not until Sunday. But between this and my Marie Callendar's b-day coupon, I'm set! :p
I lied to @UnholyAlliances, the heater under my desk is going on anyways. Brrrrr!
@BkfstinMG That would be amazing! I don't think I've even seen one at any events.
@Tzeriel @holykitt3n @elepheagle That's gotta be the intention, right?
@BkfstinMG They'd better just map my building along their routes, we'd have it by the van-load here! :p
@holykitt3n @elepheagle I'm thinking it's really a bottle of the employees' blood, but then, I've been working here a long time. :p
@BkfstinMG Ha, there's an idea for a startup business. Delivering Starbucks for special occasions!
@Ventain Me too!
@elepheagle It sure as fuck does look like one, doesn't it? LOL!
My morale would be much better improved if there was money or a Starbucks card in it or something. Just saying.
Today is NOT my b-day, but my department now sends cards near our b-day dates. To improve morale. Or something. 
@celeriekt @zerena_hoofs I know, too bad it'll be so brief.
@Girl_Grey @french4jonwayne I'm getting ready to purge a bunch of clothing to the Goodwill, as a matter of fact. They love the larger sizes.
@UnholyAlliances I might not even have to turn on the heater under my desk this morning.
@zerena_hoofs Right? It's turned cold on us again down here.
@MadynnMads I was shaking my groove thang in my car seat.
@elysiane Like clouds for your feet. I suspect many have never worn them.
Lucky thing I dodged the local speed trap before Eddy Grant's Electric Avenue came on the radio!
@kikibunny_ They're heavenly. And warm. &lt;3
@Fred_TheGeek Exactly! I know they're homely, but they feel so good!
I saw UGG bashing tweets, and as I walked out the door in my UGGs, I was glad I stopped giving a shit what people thought a good bit ago. :)
@Xandara @Osephala It makes me especially happy this morning, weather decided to dip down to 39° and I've got a sore throat. Perfect timing!
@Osephala And I absolutely love it. The colors called to me when you posted it, I felt now was as good a time as any. Thank you! &lt;3
@Osephala Surprise! It was! My paypal account still has a business name on it when I was selling stuff on eBay to try to make ends meet.
@Rastailian @Osephala It does. I don't know if on purpose or just from a nice smelling household.
As it would happen, we're expecting some late season storms, so I might be able to use that this week.
Look at this pretty from @Osephala's Etsy store. So soft, and it even smells good, too. 

Ah well, as the saying goes, good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment.
What advice can you give someone who already "knows", even though it's so obvious that they don't know? Let them twist in the wind, I guess.
@Osephala Me too. Because I have tried everything to keep that bitch out of my sight.
@Osephala I know. Someone we've mutually blocked each other, I still see when people mention her directly as if she were someone I followed.
LRT: Oh yeah, that happened today. Four goals ahead of that little fella on the "other" team. Just sayin'.
Closing out with lemon cake. #winning 
Don't tell anyone I said that, though (about being such a chick). It'll ruin my image.
Damned better Easter than last year. Shared it with the bf for the first time, got to lavish him with noms. I'm such a chick.
That needs no comment, does it?

@Alairthephoenix Indeed, hooray! :)
@XDeviantOnex @clockwork_bells @ellellesays @Zuulzilla @twenty20sight @Ceraphus @tempusfrangit @Lignar May your eggs always be hard boiled!
@MadynnMads That needs to be in a meme for something. Poor thing, but lord!
@MadynnMads Lol, omg.
@Ladiesrdtable Yes, we'll file this under... efficiency. Yes. ;)
@tempusfrangit @Jangosagony @RealTerrorwulf Scarves are necessary here too, but whenever you get around to it. You have enough to deal with.
@tempusfrangit Haha! Seriously, though, this ham makes we wish for more holidays. Except for the sodium. Yikes! #sorrydoc
@Jangosagony @RealTerrorwulf I couldn't agree more. Although we did a damned fine job of that LDR, if I do say so myself. :)
@zerena_hoofs Thanks, sweet baby Z! &lt;3
The Easter ham! #foodporn #honeybaked 
@RealTerrorwulf Yes, with me making you a wonderful Easter brunch of eggs and leftover hamburger patties! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
One benefit of just stepping out of your pajama bottoms when you go to bed: you just step right back into them and pull them up! #lazy
@jaygurrl Likewise, sweetheart! <GROWING HEART>
@klonkadonk Thanks, me too. &lt;3
@clockwork_bells <FACE THROWING A KISS>
So now Easter will always hold more significance than ever before for me. And kids, I plan on spending it celebrating with those I love. :)
And it was on Easter Sunday that I was admitted to ICU with that embolism. But I survived. It feels like my resurrection day, too. #1yearago
Because, although the date was different, it was on Easter Sunday that @RealTerrorwulf told me to go to the hospital because I was so ill.
Happy Easter, everyone! I may not be a believer, but I still believe it's a great day to gather with family and friends and celebrate life.
@NotintheAsylum @tycertank LOL @Lilu-kali!
@tycertank @NotintheAsylum My wit's not so quick tonight, but don't let me stop you!
@SunshineDagron I get you. This Easter marks an anniversary of sorts for me too. /hugs, friend. Here's to the strength to make it through. <GROWING HEART>
@Imshortwtf Happy Easter to you, too, my dear friend! I hope you're ready for a nice day! <BOUQUET>
@noelove @Faythemage @ShaofHappiness Good tip!
@ShaofHappiness @Faythemage @noelove **jaw-drop** That sounds amazing!
@tycertank @NotintheAsylum Uh-oh...
@Faythemage @noelove Nope. It was just a little snack one. Having some fried chicken later (Stater's). Also, LOVE "blank-berto's". Too true!
@noelove @Faythemage I hate (not really) you both! I just had a frozen burrito.
@NotintheAsylum @tycertank It's a rare talent. (I am giggling right now because I googled "four armed woman" and tons of images appeared.)
@tycertank I... Uh... quickly sketched this self portrait. 
That little dog has gotten so attached to his adventure buddy!
@Juunoswow Burn everything. It's the only way to be sure.
My Jack Russell, Milo, howls in the most mournful way when he can't be in the yard while the bf is using the lawnmower and weed eater.
@Juunoswow Oh that? That's what's going to be in my nightmares tonight! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@zerena_hoofs That's true, lol!
@zerena_hoofs Dang, I had no idea Mr. H was sporting that much ink!
@NotintheAsylum Yeah! We're eating Jesus' thigh!
@Disneygirl85 You know, thank you. That clears my conscience! &lt;3
@Menniss_Madoran Or Borussia Dortmund, the German football team. But he's a racehorse on the big Derby trail. A pretty one, at that.
@tycertank This very thought has crossed my mind, believe me! I'm hoping knowledge is power in this case. I hope, I hope, I hope.
LRT: I'm really liking Dortmund for that first Saturday in May, but an unbeaten horse on Kentucky Derby Day makes me nervous.
@BobBaffert @santaanitapark @benoitphoto_ 
@tycertank The world would be in trouble if there were more than one of her! :p
@NotintheAsylum It seems a gruesome symbol in a way, but then most of Easter is filled with pagan symbols, eggs and bunnies. Why not? :)
@MichelleS_68 Lol, that's pretty much it!
@tycertank Would a muzzle be out of the question? ;)
@Disneygirl85 I just think of all the commercials about leaving pets and babies, but I guess there's an exception for stubborn old ladies.
So you know what? Fuck her. She can bake in that effing car.

What a terrible thing to say about my mother, right? You try dealing with her.
Because we don't ever hear of the vast statistics of parking lots all over Southern California that don't have a robbery or mugging.
Because she's glued to the news 24/7 and she hears stories of people being robbed in parking lots while they sit in a car.
It's about now that my patience has been lost with my mother. When she makes me leave her in the hot car with the windows rolled up.
@NotintheAsylum Well, it's usually a ham or maybe a leg of lamb. Potatoes of some type. A vegetable. Rolls. A dessert like a pie/cake.
Now, groceries. Easter tomorrow and stuff. I'm not a believer, but I like the tradition of the Easter dinner. ;)
Well, @Inthemood_live was a lively little musical, and they paid tribute to the many veterans in the audience. Touring now, would recommend.
@MichelleS_68 That is dead-on accurate. That is also the predominant hairstyle.
@FoxRiverside Sure thing. Keep doing what you're doing! &lt;3
@MichelleS_68 Dude! The indignation on some of these faces. I'm trying not to laugh, but I am smirking.
I'm missing important Kentucky Derby preps. Carpe Diem had a big win in the Bluegrass Stakes. Looking for Dortmund in the Santa Anita Derby.
These old ladies are crabby as fuck. If one bumps into the other, they're all stank-eye and angry muttering.
@SaltySlainte Valances! Wait, wut?
Ok, this musical is redeemed. It wasn't listed, but "Sing, Sing, Sing" was a thing, thing, thing.
@ChicksLuvDaLock No, I haven't, but I must! The thought of the Gypsy Kings intrigues me!
Curtains!
I don't think I see Benny Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing" in the music list. I may need a refund.
@Jubafisher Yay! &lt;3
I made the list! ^.^
I need more drugs. Please let this thing start soon so she'll be quiet.
Gone with the Wind had its first public showing here as a rough cut, before it premiered in Atlanta. Lots of history here. @FoxRiverside
The best thing about any show at @FoxRiverside is this gorgeous old theater. It was derelict for so long, now it's beautifully restored.
My mom is 78 but she looks younger than that. These people are o-l-d. 

My god, I've just seen my future. I am now a suicide risk.
Dude, I am in the canes and walkers section now. And I'm not saying that because I think I'm too cool for school. It's true.
Taking Mom to "In The Mood" musical, with (you guessed it) a 40's style big band revue. 
@Menniss_Madoran @Tzeriel Absolutely!
@Tzeriel Especially because they're mercenaries. They get good money to foment hatred, regardless of the effect it has. Yeah, I could go on.
@Tzeriel Him and Ann Coulter make the perfect couple.
“@DanonymousMan: #Juba does it! @Jubacolt does it @TheNYRA 
@Tzeriel Don't get me started, man. I could go on for days.
@Xandara 
@legracen I endorse this message.
@Rhett_CTR @Remghar LOL!
@Remghar Lol... Well, phonetically, it's almost right!
Has anybody else had problems with iMessage the last few days? Messages not delivering?
@fadedtimes Oh, man... Whataburger! I haven't had that since the last time I was in New Mexico, which is ages ago.
@RealTerrorwulf @Killadrix All I can say is keep racking up those frequent flyer miles when you go see him! We'll be able to go to Hawaii!
@zerena_hoofs That and I'm hitting the "garage" before I go!
LRT: I'm taking my mom to this today because she wanted to go and I'm trying to be nice for some reason. Lucky for me I like big band music.
@Killadrix @RealTerrorwulf Damn, Dan. I guess I can't blame him, then. I'd heard you were a hot piece of ass, now I think I know why. ;)
@Killadrix @RealTerrorwulf So that's where he goes when he slips away at night! He just said he was going to get a Big Gulp... why me? <CRYING CAT FACE>
@MrsDeviantOne So that's what @XDeviantOnex looks like! Now I have a face to go with the craziness he posts!
@0utofBeta But the kind of "blown away" movie we're looking for is far and few between. At least, that's what I think.
@0utofBeta I think that feeling stems from a dearth of good movies in general. When we hear a lot of positive word, we get hopeful.
@0utofBeta Yeah, I liked it, but I wanted to like it so much more.
@tempusfrangit I feel that way about Erasure.
@RealTerrorwulf &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
(Plus killing things = win!<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>)

@TinyBunnyfoofoo @Eddiepalitoy @Xolosfrosthart @TheRealCyberelf @YAWoWB @Imshortwtf @PerpetualCaster @Alsoriawow @Araselo @HonorsHammer TY!
Cause/effect? I don't know.
Today, I lamented depo-provera's fabled weight gain side-effect on the doctor's scale. Now, I eat buffalo chicken bacon-stuffed-crust pizza.
It's still weird that I want to go text the bf that I'm logging onto game, then realize I can go tell him.

Trying to get tickets for a show my mom wants to see tomorrow. (@ Fox Performing Arts Center in Riverside, CA) 
Getting my Easter ham! (@ HoneyBaked Ham in Riverside, CA) 
@RealTerrorwulf @lockrocks80 Yes. 18 months and we're already under the same roof. It's been quite a journey that's only just starting.
@NotAnna On second thought, you could talk about how awesome yours is. That'll frost 'em!
@NotAnna And hopefully, you never will! :)
@NotAnna Haha! My office is predominantly male, and I see these little powwows quite frequently, aimed at us! :p
@RealTerrorwulf @lockrocks80 It goes to show, friendship based on humor can really lead to something big.
@lockrocks80 @RealTerrorwulf TY, sweetie! It all started with really bad "large vegetable" jokes and went from there! 
@eljeppy @AlternativeChat That's the spirit. I look forward to more wit and wisdom from both of you! /hugs
@eljeppy @AlternativeChat I love you both. The end.
@AlternativeChat @eljeppy Oh, don't quarrel, you two. You're both the most lovely people I know!
@Mominatrix75 @RealTerrorwulf True. It's just reflexive.
@MichelleS_68 I pass by this ramshackle house omw to work that had a shiny yellow Hummer parked in the driveway. Made me LOL.
@RealTerrorwulf Do it really? :p
@RealTerrorwulf I should be saying that to you, boob puncher!
@RealTerrorwulf I know! I said that! :p
@RealTerrorwulf I wonder if it's an iMessage problem, because of how this one sent for me, and I'm down in the city.
@RealTerrorwulf Texting is hit or miss. You may or may not get a text soon.
@MichelleS_68 Haha, so true! And as far as I'm concerned, any guy who considers a sports car a sign of success suffers from teenie weenie! <WINKING FACE>
@MichelleS_68 Lol, right? I mean, at least concede the point and make your own argument a little clearer. Without getting mad or uncivil.
@Menniss_Madoran Haha, that's pretty much it. Next time don't ask and save me the trouble of a "wrong" answer! :p
@NotAnna Lol, right? He blocked me after that, so I never saw him again.
Post-doctor moping binge-breakfast. (@ Coco's Bakery Restaurant in Riverside, CA) 
Looking over a discussion from two years ago on Timehop. I wonder what ever happened to this jackass. 
My home away from home. Not counting the CAPE Union office. Or work. Geez. When am I home? 
@Siccah @NokiOfAzeroth LMAO! So that's how it works, there's prizes!

I'm gonna run to FB and freak out the homophobes with this one! :p
@SaltySlainte Nothing I like better than a big, hot pickle! Wait, wut?
@eschaz12 Speaking of Alysheba (my fave) and earlier Afleet Alex, do you remember Alysheba clipping heels w/Bet Twice in the Derby stretch?

@Rhett_CTR They must be random. I've no podcast, a sporadic blog, and I never  talk about StarCraft.
Apparently our new phone system keeps timing out the conference callers. Usually right when someone is saying something important.
This meeting. Full of fail.
@LorekeeperGlaci Yeah, they knew my name, that's promising.
Oh. I got into the @StarCraft closed beta. Well.
@RealTerrorwulf I didn't think it mattered for iMessage. I mean, it works on airplane wifi.
@TheMagesTable @clockwork_bells @Zuulzilla Mine too!
@Marathal_2_0 @RealTerrorwulf I heard you liked weird, weirdo!
@RealTerrorwulf Are you hooked into the wifi still?
@RealTerrorwulf Mine said delivered, so yeah, it is weird.
@XDeviantOnex Shouldn't that be the other way around?
@XDeviantOnex You! A usual suspect!
@RealTerrorwulf I got one and sent one back, so I don't know.
@Alairthephoenix YES! I love my altoids! :)
@Alairthephoenix I had gotten it because I read it helped with IBS as it anesthetizes the gut, but it turned out I needed coated capsules.
@Alairthephoenix Ah, peppermint oil I already have, for future use.
@Alairthephoenix Ok, cool! That's really good to know. It's fairly painful, so I think tomorrow I'll hunt up some clove oil! Thank you! &lt;3
@Alairthephoenix Right on, that's a good tip. Does it work well on external injuries, too?
@MichaelJPetty @BaleyBlue ROFL! That is brilliant!
@MichaelJPetty @BaleyBlue That she would be a great lesbian?
CAPE Benefit Trust Meeting (@ CAPE - California Association of Professional Employees - @capeunion in Pasadena, CA) 
I just think women get each other better. I look at @clockwork_bells and @Zuulzilla as the gold standard of this.
@Sabriality Awwww! &lt;3!
It's too bad homosexuality isn't a choice. I think I would have made a great lesbian.
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
@Alairthephoenix Where might I find clove oil?
@FlyDraenei @prettypaladin Oooh! That is a pretty color!
Oh, well. Sorry, Boss. Maybe Monday.
There's seemingly a conspiracy for folks to suck up my spare time whenever I'm trying to finish something before the end of the work day.
@Rhett_CTR Oh honey, this ain't my first rodeo! :p
.@BaleyBlue God. No. I developed big boobs early and was subjected to much teasing over it. You will never see me looking for boob attention
@zerena_hoofs Especially with a company that charges as much and claims to have better ingredients as @bluebuffalo does.
@polyhimnia @Bluefer2 Yeah, they're too big to be allowed to get away with nonsense. They'll get themselves, other horses, and people hurt.
@polyhimnia @Bluefer2 Oh boy. Like they say about dogs, there are no bad horses, only bad owners.
“@goulcher: This needs to become a thing 
@Bluefer2 @polyhimnia LOL, if only we knew what the horse would say if he could see himself. Would he roll his eyes? :p
@WhatIDidThere @jaygurrl LOL, Bag Balm! I still keep that on hand for the horses! Cures everything!
@polyhimnia Ouch! Yes, it does. And that rearing is bad news. I hate horses that are unruly at turnout. It's super dangerous.
@polyhimnia Especially if you're not in a position to properly correct them because of a namby-pamby owner hovering around.
@jaygurrl Haha, it's like you're not supposed to put Vick's inside your nostrils but my mom always did that to me, too! :p
@jaygurrl Thanks for reminding me about that!
@jaygurrl Oh yeah, true, they make some oral agents (sounds like porn) that work on some of these issues. It's been so long, I'd forgotten.
@stubbytumps Thanks, hon! Yeah, when you can feel your pulse in your jaw, it's an unhappy moment. :p
@wowhuellhowser You probably had to fight her for them! Hopefully you can look back now and laugh?

@midneyet @Hawgeye_ctr I may have to go. I've a regular dr's appt in the morning, I'll maybe see what she thinks about a release/antibiotics
@Hawgeye_ctr It may come to that. Boo. :(
@Hawgeye_ctr I mean, they made me get a doctor's release just because my blood pressure was high when they tested it.
@Hawgeye_ctr Well, beyond my usual reluctance, it's complicated now that I'm on blood thinners. I think they'll be anxious about it.
@Rezznul Happy birthday, friend! <BIRTHDAY CAKE>
@Cole_Belle Yeah, because it's astringent, I think that was the explanation I'd heard. Definitely will try!
@Cole_Belle Oooh! I had forgotten about that! Thanks! ^.^
So, like, I've got a raging infection/abscess in my gum. Does anyone have any home remedies besides salt water or antibiotics (or dentist)?
@Uverse So what's going on with @FOXSports1? I don't want to miss any MLS or soccer coverage. People do change providers over these issues.

I wish the 91 #fastrak lanes were like @ExpressLanes. I'm trapped in these lanes, no exits, in a traffic jam, while the free lanes zip by.
@celeriekt Haha!
@FlyDraenei Yes! Totally!
@FlyDraenei @PerpetualCaster Right? I barely have time for a couple of hours in the evening as it is!
@FlyDraenei LOL, yeah! Like when my Union office was in Echo Park and I had to fight Dodgers' traffic on Sunset through Elysian Park. Sloww.
@Cole_Belle That's why I live there. My neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. My commute is horrible, but it's worth it.
@FlyDraenei Yep, it's relative. Pasadena to Long Beach can take that long. Half the distance.
@PerpetualCaster @FlyDraenei They drive 150-200 miles round trip per day.
@PerpetualCaster @FlyDraenei And luckily I don't go all the way downtown. But, there are people from even further, Victorville and Temecula.
@Cole_Belle I knew there were high end mobile home parks by the ocean along Pacific Coast Hwy, and Malibu has always been bad. But wow.
@FlyDraenei Yeah, 47 miles, about 90 minutes (or more). It wasn't that bad during the recession. Now... I listen to a lot of audiobooks. :p
Manufactured housing selling in Malibu for $2.75 million. Yes, mobile homes. Fancy ones, but still. HOA fees are $2,200/mo. Holy crap!
@Cole_Belle @Faythemage Yeah, they're pretty easy on public employees, but not safety-related, understandably.
@klonkadonk @Cole_Belle @Faythemage Like hurricane parties in the South!
@Cole_Belle @Faythemage I've got herbal remedies as well. I'm legal. :p
@Cole_Belle @Faythemage I'm waiting for Jay to experience his first one. I have booze and a defibrillator standing by.
@Faythemage @Cole_Belle Shoot, I don't even get out of bed anymore when one happens during the night.
@spiderkav Bring me a coke too!
@Sabriality It's a side of you I haven't seen. :p

Also, Happy Birthday! <BIRTHDAY CAKE>
@Sabriality Phooey? These are strong words, madam. Strong words indeed.
@EthanPatton it's one of the most expensive places to live in the country. Which is why my salary only looks good on paper. :p
@EthanPatton There's none given for that metric. Straight median. But median price/sf is $375/sf LA, $173/sf for Riverside.
Median home price in LA County is $465,000. Median home price in Riverside County is $305,000. Which is why I live in Riverside and commute.
@RealTerrorwulf Digilence! Yay!
@RealTerrorwulf I loved it, although I was sure you could care less!

Lol, ok, I'll stop.
@RealTerrorwulf For all intensive purposes, yes. ;)
Nothing like an economist speaking just after lunch. <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
So, this piqued my interest. These are serious pet peeves. 

@CtRGuild I was ready to beat you up considering how much I spent to transfer my toons to Aerie Peak! :p
@bitterandsalty @SaltySlainte LOL, I see what you did there!
@MichaelJPetty Thank you! :)
@spiderkav He also felt compelled to tell us he was a "strong Christian". What that has to do with the price of tea in China, I don't know.

@zerena_hoofs He needs to come to my office and see how fashionable the younger men are, and rephrase that question.
@zerena_hoofs *know. Duck you, autocorrect! :p
@zerena_hoofs Right? And you not me, I'm not a raging SJW. That crap bugs me though.
I should direct him to some of you fellas' Twitter accounts where you show off your purchases. 1965 called, dude. They want you back.
So, he says to the mixed crowd: "How many of you "ladies" like an outlet mall?" Oh, of course. Just women shop, it's all we think about. :-/
Apparently, there's a large development being planned, besides the bid for a football stadium, that includes a retail outlet center.
It's customary for the leader of the city where we have our seminars to make a brief speech about their fair city. This guy was a real tool.
And more importantly, not to disclose or agree to anything that can be attributed to me! No writing checks my ass can't cash. #CYA
He was genuinely more interested in talking due to my position with my union, but still, I think I did my best not to embarrass myself.
It's always nerve-wracking to get face time with THE big boss. I forget that I'm perfectly capable of intelligent and meaningful discourse.
IAAO-LA Spring Appraisal Seminar (@ Carson Community Center in Carson, CA) 
@tempusfrangit I didn't realize it had been a book! Huh, I must check this out.
@tempusfrangit I love that one. Haven't seen that in a while.
@tempusfrangit Is that the one with Natalie Portman, where she has the Wal Mart baby?
Tomorrow's email should be even more entertaining. Lucky thing, I'll be in a seminar.
You really have to see this group email to appreciate it, but shots have been fired. I repeat, shots have been fired.
Not to mention she totally dissed the two guys who said they would do it by singing the other guy's praises. My god, she's clueless.
Especially when she "volunteered" someone who already said he didn't want to do something. Twice. I can't wait to see what he says next!
I enjoy people who can't or won't or don't take a hint. Eagerly awaiting a response to a group email where such person just doesn't get it.
Dang, it's 80° outside, but it's so frigid inside that I have to turn on the little heater under my desk. Brrrrr!
@tax_talk This is true!
@Tzeriel @MichaelJPetty I had to stifle a laugh at my desk. That is so perfect!
@MichaelJPetty @Tzeriel Let me drink a milkshake, and I'll show you a thing or two. :p
@RobCarome That's pretty damned ironic, isn't it?
@MrsDeviantOne I was just reflecting with some friends on FB about that. We were lucky to get past 25 alive, we were such maniacs.
@MrsDeviantOne A couple of weeks, I meant. See how the old age has affected my brain? IT'S ALL OVER!! :'(
@MrsDeviantOne I don't want to hear it. In a couple of years, I'll be 3 shy of 50. FIFTY! 

I'm going to go weep now. Care to join me?
@shizukera Somebody in my block of cubicles came around because she discovered it. I was like, YAY!

That's a lie, of course. That is most certainly NOT good news.

@manabrownies I had been thinking of making a swing through San Diego to maybe visit a friend or two, might not hurt, really. Hmmm.
@RealTerrorwulf And how many times have I said that before, eh? :p
@RealTerrorwulf It's just weird. I don't get it. Is she like this with everyone, am I one of two friends, what? But I think she's harmless.
@zerena_hoofs @nodah18 OH YOU!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@nodah18 Damn. Well. :p Nah, I just try to be me, and if I'm all that, I'm succeeding. :)
@manabrownies Haha! I think about it, but she's never cruel or like OMGWTF. It's just... there's something sort of sad about it.
@nodah18 That's the only way I could be fascinating!
@RealTerrorwulf The same one. The honey bunches of scrotes one.
@RealTerrorwulf She's been like this for a while off and on. She's just really ON right now. Like really really.
@nodah18 I knew something had to be wrong with you!
@nodah18 Oh man! Have you been drinking?
@jaygurrl I'd rather share it here for everyone to see! :p
@jaygurrl I'm not sure anymore. They've changed so much with privacy settings, which is why I don't post too much personal stuff there.
@thfonz98 Exactly! No matter how I come off here, or at work, I'm an introvert in how I spend my face time.
@jaygurrl Yeah, I have those too when it comes to phone or actually hanging out. Which is why it makes no sense to me, either.
I just really want to tell her, look bitch, be cool. I'm not that fascinating. Especially on FB.
@jaygurrl Dude, it took me most of the first year we were "reunited" to convince her we didn't need to catch up on the phone.
@thfonz98 Ok, this is sounding like the consensus. She doesn't seem dangerous, but it's really weird, man.
@jaygurrl A bit, huh? I think she's really lonely. And bored. And... that sort of sounds like a creeper.
And she doesn't even follow them...
The reason it really struck me tonight is because I made a comment on my Aveda salon's page and she jumped in there and made one too.
@Jubafisher Funny though, I'm more open here, and I keep the people who I don't want to see the truth banished to FB with the cat videos.
@kikibunny_ Hahaha!
She's even said things like, when I go to the spa, we should go together. Or a movie I want to see. That kind of stuff. Makes me nuts.
This chick I went to HS with for 1 yr in maybe like 2 classes acts like we're the bestest friends. Most of my notifications are hers.
So, do any of you have one of those FB friends you were never really close with but she pretends you were anyway? And is all over your shit?
@Remghar By god, I'm with you, man.
Years of makeup and perfume, and I realize I've been doing it wrong. My next makeover, I'll look like this... 
@nodah18 Hey, I see what you did there! ^.^
@CptnCakewalk Yay! \o/
@nodah18 LOL, eg-Zactly!
@nodah18 I don't know, I think my cheeks would look too fat. I rely on my hair to balance out my chub. ;)
@Manglehaft @BaleyBlue Why would anyone do that on purpose? **cough** I did **cough**
@nodah18 I don't know if I could pull that look off! :p
I swear, only my hair could look unruly in pigtails. Naturally curly hair: not always what it's cracked up to be.
@clockwork_bells @Sabriality @zerena_hoofs I'll just leave this here.

@Wolfee27 @lockrocks80 Thanks, Wolfee. It probably won't be for a while, I'm too risky still, since it doesn't have the urgency of cancer.
@Wolfee27 @lockrocks80 Yes, with ovarian being particularly deadly. I was so relieved it wasn't, even though surgery is in the future.
@Wolfee27 @lockrocks80 Especially considering I was in ICU less than a year ago for a different issue.
@Wolfee27 @lockrocks80 Truthfully, she's had medical issues, but just because she handles them one way doesn't mean I can. I was scared.
@Osephala It gets easier once you get started, but yeah, not easy enough. And thank you, sweets! &lt;3

@shizukera Thank you. I appreciate that. Although no cancer, I will have some trying medical times ahead in the not so distant future.

@shizukera Today was her second time. The first time was on FB when I first got the news I had a mass. Should have ditched her then.
@tempusfrangit @RealTerrorwulf Yeah, see post from a couple days ago where my Jack Russell devoured bunnies. He doesn't like furry things.
@Leetawow Thank you, Leeta. I should have ditched her when she did it on FB, but when she brought it up today, that was the last straw.

@MrsDeviantOne The other being when I was in ICU for that blood clot. So, come on.
@MrsDeviantOne Yep! I sent her packing. I mean, that was maybe the second time since being on social media that I asked for support.
@spiderkav For some reason, the line from Psycho came into my head: "We all go a little mad sometimes."

@Imshortwtf Baby, it's just the beginning! Erm, wait... well, I &lt;3 you too! :D
@Tzeriel Plus, you appear to use proper punctuation and not type in run-on sentences! Sold! :p
@Atharia_Rose Yes! It was scary. I would have paid people to tell me it would be ok, I couldn't hear it enough. Some people don't get it.
@wowhuellhowser 
@Tzeriel I think that's an accurate description. It's unfortunate, but I guess she was never really a true friend. Oh, well. Onward. :)
@jaygurrl Yeah, I should have done it the first time but she talked her way out of it. No third chances. And thank you! <GROWING HEART>
@Tzeriel And she brought it up again when I mentioned people who say bad things about themselves (i.e. I'm so ugly) just to get stroked.
@Tzeriel Yes. She had DM'd me on FB to tell me "some people might think I'm looking for attention". All I did was ask for positive thoughts.
@jaygurrl That's what I believe, too.
@MadynnMads @quoriwow It does. I mean, where is the compassion?
.@Imshortwtf Especially by putting yourself down to get that affirmation. We all post selfies and stuff, that's a good bit more positive.
@jaygurrl Well, I made that tweet about ego stroking so she had to bring it up again. I'm like, not the same thing. At least not imo.
@icywiz No, I don't. I had reacted negatively to her FB message at the time, but she had to start today with it on Twitter.
@jaygurrl Likewise! &lt;3
@jaygurrl It's especially unkind when someone is scared and is grabbing for anything comforting that they can find.
@Disneygirl85 @JennMorton01 Or say nothing if they can find nothing else in their hearts. Like the old saying.
@quoriwow @MadynnMads That's pretty much it. She's gone from my FB and Twitter and may I never hear from her again.
@klonkadonk Nah, I'm sure you don't. She wasn't a gamer. Good riddance.
@JennMorton01 Oh, oops, &lt;3
@JennMorton01 This is very true. A desire for endless "it'll be ok".
@AbraxoCast Right? It was the only negative response I had received during all that.
@jaygurrl Lol, oh, of course you were! <WINKING FACE>
Welp, now she doesn't have to see it. Buh-bye!
She apparently thinks it's the same. She had actually DM'd me about it while I was waiting for test results. I guess it really bugged her.
And as I said here just now, there's a big difference between being scared and asking for support, and "tell me I'm pretty."
So, I ditched someone who was negative to me when I had my cancer scare. She said people might think I was looking for attention.
@jaygurrl Yeah, especially considering I'm not too far from evil without her.
@jaygurrl It's my evil twin!
@jaygurrl I can fix you! (That's the woman in me talking. We think we can fix anyone!)
Although apparently to some, it's all the same.
Oh, I'm sorry, I was talking about people who were looking for ego stroking, not people who have legit problems. I understand that venting.
@pegsatthemovies I don't know what other people might have thought, but the only person who had something to say about "attention" was you.
@TheRealDominia @AlternativeChat Kinky!
@Atharia_Rose Yeah! I have a secret but I can't tell you! Nyah nyah!
@AlternativeChat Haha! Put it away if you aren't prepared to use it! ^.^
@noelove I love what one! &lt;3
.@pegsatthemovies There's a big difference between that and trolling for flattering and compliments.
.@pegsatthemovies My health concern was because I wanted comfort for what I thought was a life threatening condition, and I was scared.
@noelove 
If you want to say you're a terrible person, I guess you would know better than me. Next!
I blatantly ignore tweets that are bait for ego stroking. If you want to post that you think you're ugly, who am I to change your mind?
@clockwork_bells This sounds like the phone conferences I'm desperately trying to avoid.

@BumblejinxTV I agree, although over decades of aviation, all of these things have very low probability. But that would be the highest risk.
@BumblejinxTV @AlternativeChat @BBCNews It is. It's a world with no one answer and ultimately no perfect safety. It is sad. It's tragic.
@BumblejinxTV @AlternativeChat @BBCNews But what if it had been a heart attack? The pilot, at least, can't get in? Food for thought.
@BumblejinxTV @AlternativeChat @BBCNews Well, the copilot exploited the current security measures to his own devices. Nothing is fail safe.
