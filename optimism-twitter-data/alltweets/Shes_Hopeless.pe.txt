I hate feeling afraid but not knowing what I'm afraid of.
You can find @lil_simonita and I raging to this 24/7 
I feel completely miserable.
@EmmyHeckle thank you so so much Em :)
The Engs just informed me that I get to compete for the NYC trip &amp; perform Just One Step at the IHSMTAs and I cant possibly describe my joy.
I would do anything to not be here right now.
The fear, the fear of falling apart.
@kbruns_  
I don't know you sir but I'm going to kindly ask you to step back and reconsider this.  
Oh man do I miss my person right now.
I'll split your banana. 
That sounds unaPEELing.
Ive never been more entertained 
@Shes_Hopeless today Ive found articles for how to survive a long fall, how to make out in a movie theatre, and how to buy a camel

GOOD MORNING TEXTS ARE EVERYTHING
Drip drip goes the water
Suddenly you hear a noise

A lettuce is‚Ä¶
Today I have the self esteem of a confused and awkward 13 year old girl.
Getting through the end of this school year is not putting me in a good place.
@max_tensen makeup on point
I GET TO SEE MY WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL FRIEND PLAY MARIAN TODAY AND I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.
I think it's safe to say I have a lot on my heart after tonight. Thanks select for being the best ever. #allheartsallminds
Probably crying because I feel this so hard. 
Am I falling into nothingness or flying into something so sublime?

THIS IS THE MOMENT! KONY 2012!
I don't give myself nearly enough credit for how much I've grown as a musician/vocalist in the past year... Progress to the max yo!
Three words: CLASSIC. MUSICAL. THEATRE.

The only thing that anyone really remembers is the work.

For me music theory class is like taking a kid who didn't even learn basic math and teaching them algebra.

How to make homeroom activities better: no homeroom activities. Better yet, no homeroom.
@Zoe_Carlson_ OK IM TAKING IT BACK

Mona: my dad used to think he was Ice Cube.

And I said to my heart as it foolishly kept jumping all around, I got lost, but look what I found.
Still truu @kbruns_ 
I actually don't even like cucumbers that Twitter account just kills me.
I need to gallop into a wooden glen and punch dance my rage out.
Let's be real, we dominate our conference in the fine arts.
@JOHNNY__TRILL this is total fire
Update: I had a full fledged panic attack complete with hyperventilating, crying, and my entire body going numb.

Hope misses you.  
Every now and then I see something and I'm just like, this has to be a sign... I know it's stupid but some things are just too coincidental.
@agilson7 @Lindecent now this is some quality content right here folks 
It seems like staying home all day, doing nothing, and not talking to anyone is just about the worst thing I can do for myself.
I went to bed with a splitting head ache and now a little over an hour after waking up its back. What is the meaning of this?
Those weird existential moments where you're just like this is my life and this is what's happening and I'm trying to take it all in.
Champ loves Nicholas and Caleb and it makes my heart happy.
I guarantee that the way @Elizabeth_Ann31 tells stories will have you rolling every time.
When you're trying to do your musical but baes sitting with that thottie out in the audience @IsabelaFlores15

@Cherry__2000 Hahahahaha I think we all feel this emotion at some point in our lives
I just started crying for literally no reason so that's really cool.
@lil_simonita god bless
I have a sudden uncontrollable desire to play the sims for hours on end.
@Shes_Hopeless probably not terribly well seeing that you didn't even use the proper form of "your" in english
Hmm you should try learning a completely new language and see how that goes for you buddy... 
@hick_tristan97 I was literally just about to tweet this
"No nipples... Male or female"
@kbruns_ is the worlds cutest zombie
Caleb Townsend is one crazy cat.
I'm seeing a lot of sad tweets on my timeline right now, so here's your reminder that you're strong, wonderful, and that it will get better.
I'm not saying the effort is a waste of time but I just love you for the things you couldn't change, though you've tried.
@BFChoir yes! Wasn't that considerate of me?
"And they baked him a party, and threw him a cake"
Sorry about the alarms guys, I just dropped my mix tape.

@Cherry__2000 @melorentzen YAAAAS
-No one ever.
@Shes_Hopeless I would just like to reinstate that these lyrics are perfect
I've experienced 20 or so tech weeks in my life and they were all horrible in their own special way but this one might actually kill us all.
I'm afraid to ask person how they feel so instead I just speculate on every single possibility constantly it's really just the cutest thing.

ever.
If you can hold on, hold on.
@lil_simonita @IsabelaFlores15 never stop Isa

Not getting sleep is so bad because my anxiety just goes haywire.

THIS SUMMER MUSICAL THEATRE CAMP THING IS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED GOODBYE
Mama Mia is closing after 14 years on Broadway because I am finally the dancing queen. There can only be one.
I'd like to just give myself a pat on the back for being ridiculously patient. Good job, Hope. Good job.
It's harder to touch the things that are dearer, I love you too much to trust something clearer. I know I fell too far. But here you are. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><BLUE HEART>

You know what guys? I'm going to stop feeling sorry for myself, get out of bed, look hot, and be ok because things WILL get better.
I think I can be ok I just need to lay in bed alone for a long time. Yeah actually I probably don't need to do that all but try and stop me.
My brother eats everything in this house including my hopes and dreams.
@carley_white @TheWeirdVines ITS SO DRAMATIC BUT ITS A SIMPLE LAWN MOWER

And when you wake up everything is going to be fine, I guarantee that you wake in a better place and in a better time.

I had to tell you that your selfie on snapchat just slayed me <OK HAND SIGN><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>@RealEmilyTierra
I was literally about to have a musical moment where I broke into song that reflected my mood but then I stubbed my toe &amp; now I'm just upset
Listening to other people's favorite music makes me extremely happy.
@redbearia 
And there was a kid, with a head full of doubt, so I'll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out.
I've found lately that the it'll buff mentality works about 99% of the time.
BUT GUYS JASON ROBERT BROWN IS GOING TO BE HERE FOR THE BRIDGES TOUR LAUNCH THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR MY LEVEL OF EXCITEMENT OVER THIS
When @dsmperforming releases their season line up its like Christmas all over again.
THE NEW SEASON IS SO GOOD SOMEBODY COME HOLD ME WHILE I CRY.
GENTLEMAN'S GUIDE AND SUTTON FOSTER ALSO IS THIS REAL LIFE HELP
THEY ARE LAUNCHING THE BRIDGES TOUR IN DES MOINES OMG IM CRYING
My life is about to get awesome.
Do you ever just remember Jacob Thrap exists and get really happy?
@Lindecent @Zoe_Carlson_ to be fair you both look pretty hot
@coachcarlhoops @Johncarlson340 @carlson0824 THAT WAS JOHN LMAO
Kelli O' Hara is literally everything I want to be in life.
@Lindecent @Zoe_Carlson_ art in its purest form
I have cried twice in my life, once when I was 7 and was hit by a school bus, and then again when I heard that Li'l Sebastian had passed.
Iconic 
I was literally in the midst of an emotional breakdown but I turned on Parks and got me some hot cheetos and just like that I'm a new woman.
Everything is confusing.
GAHHHHHHHHHHHFKFLEBRNKGKF
Sleeping At Last has incredibly beautiful music.
@IsabelaFlores15 @laurenthellama this made my day thanks pal <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Lately my life feels like a sad yet quirky indie film.
We decided to turn Matthew into a meme. 
I have a lot of feelings rn
Its quite defeating when someone you care about is struggling and you can't do much to help even though you'd do literally anything to help.
@LoaizaNation @RealEmilyTierra omg two of my favs in one pic <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@BFartroom @BFHSBands @BFChoir you won't regret it :D
Pippin hit me hard. Also, I really want to play Catherine now.
Id rather be blue, thinking of you, Id rather be blue over you, than be happy with somebody else.
@temporaryybliss yes, it's hard to believe that this is only coincidental when our ages are so similar...
One of the things I love most about the fine arts is the incredible people I get to do them with. Days like today remind me of that.
@temporaryybliss Yeah nope... Bummer, I was really hoping it would all suddenly come back to me and Id find out about my long lost handprint
@temporaryybliss maybe... Where is this?
Grannies got back <OLDER WOMAN><VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è

One of the day care kids just said me and Mona look like twins.... There's a first time for everything.
Cope Harlson
I've really been digging Muse as of late.
@BFartroom haha will do!
I do extensive research on the Myers Briggs types of people I care about in order to understand their every move. Its creepy yet effective.
Ive waited my entire life for snapchat to let you record music. I can finally aggressively lip sing my show tunes and annoy everyone I love.
I accidentally woke up one of my moms day care kids searching for my phone and now it won't stop screaming. In conclusion: I hate everything
That feel when you listen to a song and realize how relevant it is to your life/current situation and it's just like SHIT MANNNNNNNNNNNNNNnn
Julie Andrews is my grandma.
IM NOT SAD IM NOT SAD IM NOT SAD IM NOT SAD IM NOT SAD IM NOT
How do you casually tell someone you would do anything for them? How do you make it chill?
If you're ever sad imagine your crush dressed as a Newsie. And if that doesn't work imagine yourself dressed as a Newsie.

All I know is that I just found this on my phone and I think it needs to be cherished. 
Can we make Matthew reaction pictures a thing again? If that even really was a thing. To me it was a thing.
The important thing is to always listen to corny love songs from musicals and follow your dreams.

Hi. How to make an electric guitar. Well I don't know but from the name of it it's just a combination of guitar and electricity.
@bridget_akers AMEN
Nothing makes this not suck. Nothing.
If I was only able to listen to the Spring Awakening soundtrack for the rest of my life I would almost be ok with that I love it that much.
Life
The past two mornings I've just sat in my car and yelled really loud about my problems and it's the most therapeutic thing I've ever done.
She's literally hopeless.
I have never been this conflicted.
This hurts
@kyle_kinmonth ha no... But that too I suppose
I CAN DO THIS GUYS I CAN I REALLY CAN
I feel the emotions of others very deeply.
Always looking on the bright side 
I get a lot of secondhand embarrassment for creeping other peoples facebooks.
I forgot my headphones the day is ruined.
DONT UNDERESTIMATE MY LOVE FOR JASON ROBERT BROWN
THERES BEEN SOMETHING STUCK UNDER MY TONSIL ALL DAY AND ITS PAINFUL AND ANNOYING AND IT LITERALLY WILL NOT COME OUT NO MATTER WHAT I DO HELP
Does someone ever say something so nice to you that you can feel yourself start to cry? because wow
I somehow managed to get my car in the most awkward spot ever through a series of hasty decisions and now I'm never getting out of here.

‚Äú@TheatreProblems: Miss Saigon - UK Production #TheatreProblems 
So me basically.
I guess my ideal roles are funny AND mentally unstable.
I feel like I'm pretty much always cast as an extremely funny role or an extremely serious/mentally unstable role &amp; there is no in between.
Lol I hate myself
The way that audition went I will likely be cast as a tree.
@kyle_kinmonth do it up Kyle. Go for gold.
This show makes my heart happy.
We used to eat cereal out of frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.

THE AMOUNT OF FAVORITES AND RETWEETS ARE BACK I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
Sometimes you just need to hear one thing and that one thing makes it all ok.
I'm about 90% musical theatre trash.
Fun idea: cancel school forever
It doesn't show how many favorites tweets have anymore and I don't know why but I'm very deeply bothered by it.
IM BORED
I'm a dead girl walkingggggg
Overtures in movie musicals are completely unnecessary.
Kaitlyn and Jacob sibling snapchats are what I live for.
Do you ever just realize YOU'RE SMOOTH AS HELL?
Probably listening to the Spring Awakening soundtrack
Give me pain if that's what's real, it's the price we pay to feel.
Laying in bed all day was probably the worst possible idea.
My special talent is being able to tell which cast recordings are which from just about any show you can think of.
Life is sort of kind of awesome right now.

That was tighter than Karisha's sports bra.
All I wanted was an ice cream-slushie mixture that didn't have tiny ice spheres in every sip but I guess I was asking for too much.
I can't handle how intense Shrek 2 is.
Puts on resume: good at taking selfies, extensive knowledge of musicals.
I just did a dramatic reading of Fergalicious and it was excellent.
I feel so illumined.
PEOPLE WHO SMELL GOOD ARE SUPER COOL
School is honestly the worst because its such a toxic place for me and I can't remove myself from it.
‚Äú@TipsForSevies: Do not use your phone in class. You should be listening to your teacher for maximum learning ability.‚Äù Damn straight
@mariahalyse2014 EXACTLY and we just can't have those types of people in our lives.
I just unfollowed someone for saying that they didn't like musicals. I don't mess around with that shit.
@bridget_akers awwwwwwww I miss you too. you're such a babe.
@lil_simonita I'm glad you can accept it.
@lil_simonita they absolutely can't stand you tbh
I underestimated the amount of energy it takes to do an ensemble where most of the piece I'm yelling and crying.
I logged Simona's twitter off the app on my phone a few weeks ago and I still get all of her notifications...?
Lol I'm miserable

Can anyone explain what just happened?
I can always count on school to make me feel like complete shit.
Can we all just take a minute and discuss the genius that is Jason Robert Brown?
I want to fill a bathtub with mini marshmallows and lay in it.
Kaitlyn is making us food <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I don't appreciate my dreams making me feel things. I didn't ask for any of this.
Having long arms basically means you are always the one who has to take the selfies in a group.

Sad and bored.
Good luck to @melorentzen at all state tonight! Sing your heart out happy giraffe!

See the luck I've had could make a good man turn bad.
@kbruns_ heck yeahs!
You would be the person to remind me that I didn't make all state.

@kyle_kinmonth seems simple enough. Thanks Kyle!

@erinwinders wow

My sister is taking up half of my seat with her leg and I'm about to lose my shit.
Having to share the backseat with my mom and sister for 2 hours is the worst. I didn't ask for any of this.

Pictionary telephone is the best thing that ever happened.
Much needed K time about to happen.
I can't even describe how much music means to me and how much it has impacted my life.
All members of the triptet had to pee before our lesson... You know what that means. WE ARE HYDRATED AF.
@coachcarlhoops Way to go, dad!
@kbruns_ Wow good for us
I will pay someone money to punch me in the face.
My face after concert choirs performance 
@CrossfireYG proud of you
If you aren't keeping track of how many times a day you pee, are you even a part of the #hydrationnation? ?? Probably not
#hydrationnation is lacking today. I need to up my fluid game.
@kbird13 you're a babe &lt;3

Today is a day where I just want to go home.
I hope you're proud dad.

@erinwinders EXACTLY THANK YOU
@fuqyodreams her she shouldn't
@fuqyodreams sure but if a girl likes to wear a lot of makeup then I think she should be able to do that to and doesn't need a guy telling
@fuqyodreams well they shouldn't. And even if they do they can wear it however they want.
Here's a wild idea ladies, wear whatever the heck makes YOU feel good. Makeup is 100% about yourself 0% about others. 
I don't want to go back to school tomorrow so bad that there isn't even a Matthew reaction pic to express it.

If you're having a bad day just listen to the Drake and Josh and iCarly theme songs I guarantee you will feel 100% better.
Making plans with people... Even simple plans. Way too stressful. Hate it.

Everyday is a good day when you get to watch live theatre.
Ok so this couple on Four Weddings cut pizza instead of cake. If that's not love I don't know what is.
I just got a frosted flake temporarily lodged in my throat. Not a fun experience. Chew your food kids.
I can't stop thinking about choir and speech... I'm honestly ready to go back to school just for those two things.
I had to get two inches cut off my hair... Thanks Hairspray.

Kelli O'Hara is my soprano spirit animal.
People are just so awful to each other I can't even believe it.

Mandatory post church nap starts now.
I keep having dreams I'm in prison.
It really sucks when you feel so much anxiety and sadness that you feel like it has control of your life.
I need to have people over though because my room is finally done and I need people to see its coolness.
I'm really bad at planning things. Really bad.
THERE IS SO MUCH CLEVER FORESHADOWING IN ALL THE WICKED MUSIC
@lil_simonita No you
Sometimes I'm not a very good friend and I feel really guilty about it.
Wow you are a person. A person who is cute. What a nice quality.
YOU WERE A CAN OF ROASTED RED PEPPERS AWAY FROM 16,000 DOLLARS MAN THATS UNFORTUNATE
Shows like Let's Make A Deal and The Price Is Right give me high anxiety because I want them to win so badly.
Kim Kardashian Hollywood isn't just a game it's a life style.

My special skills include extremely low self esteem.
I will be the only junior in my drivers ed class tomorrow... I mean it's not surprising but it's still disappointing.
My dad's Pitbull impersonation is definitely up to par.
Currently at the Carlson house: Lindey is MIA in the corn field.
I'm ready to start making music again.

THIS SEASON FINALE IS SO INTENSE MAN
I can't help but constantly feel like an expendable person.

@Eohani_Ahawah Id go to the park with you but unfortunately I am approximately 630 miles away from your current location.
Rad Scandinavian Festival happening here in Estes Park today. #SwedishPride
You should be able to like comments on Instagram. I never have anything to respond with and want people to know I appreciate their comment.
Basically the only things I've texted Kaitlyn about on this trip thus far are 1. If the wifi is working and 2. If my LTE is working.
How many weed jokes will be made by the end of this trip? Probably way too many. #Colorado
Faith is now crying because water has been in her ear since yesterday. Stay tuned for more Carlson fun.

@Eohani_Ahawah you have made the wrong choice
@Eohani_Ahawah LOOKING FOR ALASKA ALL THE WAY
Cows are neat.
Trains are neat.
That tweet probably sounded stupid to a lot of people but seriously it makes me so happy.
I love it when songs from musicals my friends have been in come on and it reminds me of them.

The Smiths&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Singing harmonies provides me so much satisfaction.
Musicals are never not good.
@Eohani_Ahawah hahaha good
That was definitely the best opera I've ever seen.... I mean it was also the only opera I've ever seen but still... Pretty stellar.
But alone is alone not alive.
My life is just one awkward situation after another.
@RealEmilyTierra *Galinda voice* "I thought you might want to wear this hat to the opera tonight!"
@RealEmilyTierra omg yes.
REALLY THOUGH I NEED TO KNOW.
HOW DO YOU DRESS TO GO TO AN OPERA?
My eyebrow game just got complimented. Filling these babies in was the best decision I ever made.
@lil_simonita bae I texted you but I will DM you the same thing :)
Inspirational Barbie movie quotes coming at you from K-Bruns.
Barbie movies are my weakness.

Its so hard when good things come to an end. I hate leaving people behind and what I hate even more is being left behind. I can't accept it.
@Duuuue yeah umm let's pretend that I actually remembered to attach the photos...
Happy 19th Birthday to the lovely creature seen in the middle of these photos. I very much enjoy being related to her 
IM SORRY BUT THE SUNSET TONIGHT IS STUNNING AF
One of the younger girls at the theatre just gave me this. I'm crying. 
The spot for my third best friend on snap chat can pretty much be taken by anyone you just have to snap me like 5 times and your in.
I feel so sweaty and alone. Life is hard man.
I just knew if I went to bed early Id wake up at this time.
Anxiety is basically just my life.
Everytime I go on Facebook I get uncomfortable.
Who even am I? 
POLITICS MAKE ME SO MAD. I HATE THE HUMAN RACE.
@bridget_akers for real
Bridget Akers is my heart and soul.
Was I doing day care shows today? Because it seemed a little more like child slavery.
"Tracy TurnUpBlad" -@zactallman123
@EmileeCruchelow YES that is EXACTLY what I was doing
I have to get up in 5 hours and perform all day. What am I doing awake?
Wow I am dumb.
Sometimes you just have to watch Rent at 1 in the morning.
I JUST TOOK 5 SOLID SELFIES IN A ROW. IM CRYING. CALL A MODELING AGENCY IMMEDIATELY. GOODBYE THEATRE I HAVE FOUND A NEW CAREER.
Old Money is by far my favorite song on Ultraviolence. It's gorgeous.
Do you ever like want to get all cute just to take a bunch of selfies? Because I really feel like doing this right now. And now hate myself.
Why did I have the misfortune of something like that appearing on my timeline?
@OMAROUTDACUT this is the shittiest tweet I have ever seen in my life.
The video I just watched of baby ducklings trying to jump up stairs to their mom was the most stressful thing I've ever seen.
@RealEmilyTierra basically
Is Bondurant Summerfest even real?
@caseyboatwright @loganicole143 whether it be depression or anything else doesn't mean it isn't serious.
@caseyboatwright @loganicole143 everyone copes in different ways just because someone tweets about something they are struggling with
@Goozemen true very true
I have this problem where I can't be alone...like at all...or else I get sad. And its really not a good problem to have. Very inconvenient.

@Johncarlson340 children?
@kyle_kinmonth lololol
I feel cheated 
I didn't realize how much hotter that stuff made me wow.
I basically haven't worn any makeup for the past 2 weeks besides show makeup and now that Im just wearing street makeup my face feels naked.
Before its too late Happy Birthday to the one and only @kendra_fulton! I hope your day was as phenomenal as you are, Kendra!
"My name is Penny Lou Pingleton and I'm very pleased.... And scared to be here!" #Hairspray 
I JUST WANT TO WATCH MUSICALS WITH A CUTE PERSON LIKE YOU AND ALSO MAYBE SHARE SOME HOT CHEETOS IF YOU LIKE THOSE.
I was hardcore jamming in bed and I accidentally hit my head against my headboard super hard. Life is pain.
I HATE CUTE PEOPLE WHO I CANT TALK TO BECAUSE IM DUMB.
Feelings are weird.
@lil_simonita I heart you
I love my little CAP children but I would really like them to understand that I can't talk to all of them at once. #overwhelmed
My dreams last night were wow....
Just wow. Incredibly wow.
@temporaryybliss yes.
@temporaryybliss Same. I want this picture framed and in my room.

‚Äú@Eohani_Ahawah: Butts: 
@Shes_Hopeless‚Äù This is incredibly moving.

Someone punch me in the face pls
@Eohani_Ahawah what a ravishing photo you have chose
@fuqyodreams thank you *bows*
You are constantly misogynistic and yet you wonder why you don't have a girlfriend.
Getting a shot followed by getting my blood drawn followed by panic attack and hyperventilating. What a wonderful day this has been!
@CrossfireYG I don't know.... I guess I don't want to seem creepy. Haha
I don't know you but I want you all the more for that. Words fall through me and always fool me and I can't react.
IM SORRY BUT WHEN I SEE CUTE BABIES I HAVE TO SMILE AND MAKE FACES AT THEM. ALWAYS.
@lil_simonita I really miss Kaitlyn too and although I dont miss myself because I am always with myself being that I am myself I do miss you
Inspirational 
@meowitzkate dang right I am
I have a pomegranate flavored sucker and everything is going to be ok.
Nothing will ever match the thrill that live theatre brings me.
And that concludes tonight's live tweeting.
I really really like Jessie a lot.
That was so suspenseful I've never felt so much suspense
How can you say no to men tap dancing?
JESSIE AND CAROLE THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.... See what I did there?
@EmileeCruchelow NO WAY
So excited for this performance!
Neil and his husband and their kids are the cutest I'm telling you.
RAMINS SON IM CRYING
I KIND OF LIKED THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DIDNT I FEEL CONFLICTED
AM I OK WITH THIS?
WHAT IS HAPPENING? I DONT KNOW IF IM OK WITH THIS. I DONT THINK I AM.
Meanwhile I continue to be bitter that Bridges is not performing.
This Elphaba doesn't even come close to the one who performed at the civic center this fall.
But Celia...
"Is that Harry Potter?" -my mom
Jason Robert Brown is absolutely wonderful.
Can we talk about how Patina Miller was in that commercial?
SUTTON FOSTER! CAN I GET AN AMEN?
Lovin the transition music.
Embrace the metric system lol
I just want to take a minute and talk about @LenaRockerHall
SLAY NEIL
RUPAUL OMG YES
Audra I just want to hug you forever right now.
Aww bae is crying.
Audra is bae.
Wait a second what made them have Rocky perform and not Bridges of Madison County?
But Celia....
I really wish The Bridges of Madison County was performing tonight.
Best acceptance speech goes to him.
Cabaret will hopefully redeem whatever that was.
That was really just dumb I'm sorry.
