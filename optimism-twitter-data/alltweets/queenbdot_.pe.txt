Last night I kept waking up 'cause my hair was wrapping around my body. #ithinkitstimeforacut
I stepped and sat on my own fcking hair<TIRED FACE>.
My body's so sensitive; I'm allergic to everything. Plus I has insomnia. #drugaddict

I have a shitload of 32b bras &amp;small size bathingsuit tops that are too small. Hit me up! Must be size a/b otherwise your nipple will show.
I've only worn these once so I can't find it in me to throw them away<PERSEVERING FACE>. Anyone want 32b bras? 
blueroseinfante. 
It's my day off and I have no plans.
Shit goes down when rednose, danza kuduro, or suavemente comes on.
Why is everyone sending snaps of food right now?! I'm hungryyyyyyyyy<TIRED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Instagram got big bitches talking shit about "boney girls." Don't worry about the men we attract; do you.
Beyonce got fat girls over confident on their "thickness." Stfu, you ain't beyonce.
Movie dates NOT on the weekend are my fav<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>.
@Carmi_Aquino omg my same reaction! Lmao
For everyone asking: NO I do not have my nipples pierced it's just an inside joke with @ibejazi and @jamiesaurus. Lmao
<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> seriously got ready for nothing, again. Going out, come with me.
Oh. #datenight 
justonenight.
Plus I get bored af easily.
If we're not on the same level, we're not compatible.
I honestly can't be in a relationship cause my life is so fastpaced. I don't have time to try to help you keepup.
@ibejazi if it's on the cartilage yes. It's gonna be swollen af for daysssss. Get the Claire's solution; works wonderful.
@ibejazi pierced my own nipples cause I'm hard af.<FLUSHED FACE> lmao

Hella regretting doing out last night<PERSEVERING FACE>
And forgive me when I offer to pay. I've held my own for a long time now; I can take care of both of us baby.
Like I get the whole open the door when I get in the car thing but not getting out cause then I just awkwardly sit there and wait-.-
So glad I actually spent all Thursday with my sister. #doyouwanttobuildasnowman
