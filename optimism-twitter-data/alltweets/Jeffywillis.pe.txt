@DestinyTheGame can I please just transfer over my 360 account to my new ps4?! Like why can't i?!
I love how @PlayStation just lies and says things are up and to just reboot... Doesn't fool anyone when they can't connect
@AskPlayStation @6ee07468e65646c getting annoyed with he fact that it says servers are online when clearly it's not working
@AskPlayStation @6ee07468e65646c I'm having the same thing I have also power cycled. It's not on my end
@AskPlayStation I've rebooted and also cycled my router and modem still not able to connect to psn
@QuiKGunZ @PlayStation but that's a mixing board for audio...
@KEEMSTARx @YouTube NERDWAR
OMG it has happened... Legit nerd war is upon us with these hacking groups
OMG everyone demanding free shit from a couple days of down time.... Get real. Shut happens that's like less than 3 dollars so far
@TheKDogBrand all that for 48 hours of down time? Damn #gohard
@Sony @PlayStation @AskPlayStation uh I just got an email saying funds were added to my wallet? No idea how.

She seems nice
I swear @pewdiepie has a doppleganger that is at my table right now
Still not used to hearing Interpol on the radio, but it's awesome
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @Interpol Titos is the best.
@Bungie @DeeJ_BNG how do you "unintentionally" nerf exotic weapons? I'm trying to understand because coding doesn't work that way
@Interpol will you guys please come make another stop in Chicago soon?
Thank you so much @bankspaulbanks @Interpol for the time after the show to meet us and take pictures. Long time fan. 
@austinfig we are in Chicago and our friends couldn't afford stub hub and stuff.
@austinfig how much?
@PlunderinDesire @Interpol holy shit real jelly. Maybe I'll be able to get a picture after their Milwaukee show Saturday.
Ugh seriously though @Interpol can't play a bad show even if they tried! Last night was awesome and can't wait for Saturday in Milwaukee!
@DestinyTheGame @Bungie haha uh...
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @Wendys and not just that when I get fed up and go up to the window the person gives me bad looks like I'm stupid
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @Wendys well they could have told multiple people waiting in line they are closed instead of leaving the stuff on
So apparently the @Wendys that says it's open till 2 online isn't open and just let people sit in line at the speaker? Uh say something
@Mi55_Hollywood_ I was pooping
I don't get it, did @Bungie replace all their designers/employees with non video game players? And ripping off Xbox players as well. Why
Blasting some @theglitchmob and playing league. #crushnoobs
@Mi55_Hollywood_ :( what's wronggg
@Mi55_Hollywood_ TENITUS
@reactpresents @theglitchmob got it! Thank you guys so much it was awesome
@reactpresents @theglitchmob the guy said they don't have any :( this show is sick though 
@reactpresents I didn't get my vinyl for winning @theglitchmob thing you guys did?
@theglitchmob hey what time do you guys go on tonight?
Yeah! Thank you @reactpresents can't wait for @theglitchmob tonight as excited to see this "limited edition vinyl" as well!
Waiting on @reactpresents to reply to my Email for the awesome free tickets I won.Need to know if I still have them before I invite someone

@Mi55_Hollywood_ @reactpresents @theglitchmob BUT NOT THE VINYL
@reactpresents @theglitchmob I never win stuff fingers crossed!
@MattBellamy that's a mighty computer for a mighty wizard
@Mi55_Hollywood_ remember when my kitchen light just turned on? Yeah well my garage door just opened
I just want a @MattBellamy signed Manson guitar at some point in my life that I can hang up on the wall.
@deadmau5 do you have ableton wired through a pro tools HD set up or what's that like behind the scenes
@MattBellamy you're starting to look like a mighty wizard there....
@DavePorterMusic so I'm trying to learn modular synthesis... Any advice? Good reads or starting points?
Anyone looking for queens wrath bounty in #destiny on the 360?
@steve_duda that's awesome! Thanks for the support!
@steve_duda So a couple times a "Steve" has replied on xfer forums and helped me out. That's totally you right?
@steve_duda lol #milton
Hope you're still kicking next break I get between quarters grandmas.
@deadmau5 nice firebirds stuff. But why a one handed over 2?
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @red_Krist NO
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @red_Krist you're not annoying!!! GODDD!!!!
Is there not a way to kick inactive players in @DestinyTheGame
@MattBellamy do you even know the words to micro cuts?
I want a subaru sti SO bad. I don't even care what year or color.
@deadmau5 @Diablo torment 6 vault portal with that build yet?
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @red_Krist @callmepetey I cut it too, and uh... Jess you're wrong
@red_Krist @Mi55_Hollywood_ um woman up?
@Rbrzy89 I could never handle that.
@Electro_Luck @Mi55_Hollywood_ nah not into porter much
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @Electro_Luck and his lame sets of constant teasing
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @Electro_Luck just Incase you didn't read this already, fuck porter
@Electro_Luck @Mi55_Hollywood_ fuck porter
@deadmau5 make a parody of Micky and claim fair use...
@deadmau5 interesting how a company made by a big "remixer" of his day, one that re creates and rips others off, is upset about your logo
@deadmau5 can I remix ghosts n stuff? I'm not selling it anything. Take notes Disney. #takenotes
@deadmau5 the comments saying your Ibiza set is boring? ADHD kids with too much hyperactive dubstep drops. #ADH-Dubstep
School parking lot ;) @Mi55_Hollywood_
Sorry I can't right now. I'm busy introverting
@Disney there's really distinct differences between your logo and @deadmau5 which means there's no confusion and should co exist.
I love the fall
@feedme not like Chicago... Come back here
Does anyone know if @interpol will release el pintor in lossless?! #ElPintor
@Mi55_Hollywood_ you would just end up binge watching all the episodes
@Interpol will you guys sell a lossless version of your new album?
@bassnectar I made a free snowden sign last year for your show at @SpringAwakeFest but I don't think you saw
Well @FerrariUSA it I ever get enough money to buy one of your cars I definitely won't be doing so. Spend a lot of money to not customize it
@paulwilko10 meh still a new system plus last time they got hacked they did refund time back.
@paulwilko10 don't they do free and plus membership? I don't have a ps4 but that's how it's always been for me on my ps3?
@paulwilko10 then don't buy the service? Lol if you're so unhappy with it stick with the free online
So when @Interpol plays Stella how much are the comments going to get blown up? #ElPintor #Interpol
The noise in the beginning of not even jail is so cool, whatever they did to add that in live is awesome. #interpol #cometochicago
@kcrw biggest troll ever. Put the sound back on for @Interpol
WHY?! WHAT SONG HE PLAYING? #Interpol
WHAT?! THE SOUNDS GONE RIGHT AT THE END? WHAT?! #interpol #WHY?!
Hands away and Length of love, awesome!!!! #interpol
Ahhhh @Interpol !!! So good #interpol #livestream #ElPintor
@paulwilko10 they do refund you. It doesn't warrant a fine. Last time they gave people games and free plus membership time
It's not like it's a tax that you are legally required to give them money for. You choose to do it. So stop so the rest of us can enjoy?#psn
I don't get the reasoning behind the PSN hacking. It's their money not yours? If you don't like what they are doing don't pay them. #psn
@feedme how much for the feed me merch sign? Cause that is awesome #AMIRITE
@feedme @zeros @deltaheavy so you're playing less than an hour? :(
@feedme drawing on the tables at cheesies 
@feedme do you have anything funny on your rider?
Well wicker park isn't a bad place to be stuck in waiting on shuttle busses I suppose
I have to pick up my kid in 5 minutes so I'm going to sit here and complain to you guys for 20 minutes about how I'm on a time crunch.
@thencarolsaid @YourAnonNews yeah I'm not saying it's not a tragedy what happened but it is NOT like Palestine....
@DavePorterMusic @RichCostey also the timing... I was doing a presentation on you for one of my audio classes when you replied.
@DavePorterMusic @RichCostey I love his work too! That's awesome I would definitely be picking his brain. Thank you for the reply!
Well... Not buying @Razer again. Pretty upset to feel like their standards have dropped. G600 here I come.
@DavePorterMusic Would you be able to tell me what year your started at Philip Glass' studio? And what are your career milestones?
@RichCostey hi rich, I'm a student for audio engineering. Love your stuff, any advice or is it possible to interview you?
@Interpol NOO I didn't know about the Thursday show!!! I woulda gone 3 days in a row if I did!
@Electro_Luck @Mi55_Hollywood_ I'm only going Friday and that's the day you should go.
@Mi55_Hollywood_ it's funny cause it's true
@Electro_Luck @Mi55_Hollywood_ ARE YOU GOING YET
@Interpol please play the new and pioneer to the falls on Wednesday please
@Mi55_Hollywood_ why
@Interpol any chance of scoring an interview for a school project? Ehh?? Might as well try and ask

@LeagueOfLegends wow disconnected on your end and not a loss prevented. Thanks. Those be some mad skills your enormous high paid team has
Yeah thanks @LeagueOfLegends for dcing me for no reason, losing again, oh and saying there's a firewall blocking me when there's not
@LeagueOfLegends THIS DISCONNECTING IS NOT DEEP!!! #onedeeper
@SpringAwakeFest hey you guys remember that time @BigGigantic played there? Yeah that was pretty cool. Bring them back
Holy shit @BigGigantic mind fuck, that was unreal!!! #foreverafan

@Mi55_Hollywood_ whatever
@MidCon @SpringAwakeFest when will the bass drop? Ha
@SpringAwakeFest are camelbaks allowed in to the fest? Online it says they are but I heard a rumor that they weren't
It would be a dream come true it I ever got to score a @masseffect game. Sigh... One day.
Who is gonna play "when will the bass drop" at @SpringAwakeFest ? Cause my head will explode it will be amazing.
@feedme so awesome, will you play it at @SpringAwakeFest please?!
@djtommytrash must really love @SpringAwakeFest, 3rd year in a row #nocomplaints
WHY?! JUST WHY?! #GameOfThrones
Whatever rockstar or famous person dat at my table today at cheesecake, thank you. That is all.
@Electro_Luck @Mi55_Hollywood_ spring awakening is soon and I will have a new HODOR sign

Fuck you keywarden! Drop the damn key.
@Mi55_Hollywood_ @red_Krist @BrianTurrell that's not it at all...
@red_Krist @Mi55_Hollywood_ @BrianTurrell Sam said she doesn't understand them which obviously means she just didn't watch
@red_Krist @Mi55_Hollywood_ @BrianTurrell how have neither of you seen Star Wars?!?!
My gal @Mi55_Hollywood_ brought me pizza... I think I'll keep her around for a while longer. #mygirlfriendcanbeatupyourgirlfriend
@Mi55_Hollywood_ the technicality doesn't change the point made. Speed running = opinions of voters aka oscar = 1st place
@BlizzardCS I'm near Chicago. I'll get connected start playing and then 3005 and 3007 errors pop up
@BlizzardCS I'm in North America. I'm surfing the Internet but the launcher is real slow and when I connect to d3 it kicks me off

So @Mi55_Hollywood_ doesn't want to eat dinner with me cause "I wanna get home and watch game of thrones!!" Wtf? WHO ARE YOU??
Last night as @Mi55_Hollywood_ was drifting off to sleep... She started talking about GOT... #nerd
Who ever just mixed this fucking "like a g six" over a perfectly good mgmt song I will find you and destroy you.
@Mi55_Hollywood_ well good for you that you can go through that process with out getting annoyed! Then you can order for both of us
@Mi55_Hollywood_ NO
I'll tell YOU what I want.
Assholes
It seems silly but it's not. Like wtf shut up I'm getting there let me finish. You don't need to finish my sentence for me with a question
It just bugs me
One of my pet peeves is when someone taking my order doesn't let me finish taking my order before asking shit or saying shit
@arianajo17 I'm not saying she makes more or less lmao. I'm commenting on the fact that she probly doesn't make 100k a year
@red_Krist @alysonpaigek DING DING DING!!!
@arianajo17 no one ever said she shouldn't be excited for her new job either?
@arianajo17 no? If anything is superior it's the "I made 4 times as much" remark?
@red_Krist @alysonpaigek @Mi55_Hollywood_ none intended at least.
@arianajo17 ari... Please that's not being mean or "superior" plus I never said I made 100k. Infact I said I probly make 25k if used math
@alysonpaigek @Mi55_Hollywood_ @red_Krist so You make over 100 thousand a year? Wow that's impressive. Must be your basic math that got it!
@Mi55_Hollywood_ except for games are good. You're welcome
@theglitchmob assassin.
@deadmau5 it's pretty fun. Miss old school CS though
@Mi55_Hollywood_ WOW SPOILER OMG EVERYONE DONT READ THAT TWEET ABOUT CHEATING COMPUTERS

Guess whatever on New Years.
Supposed to get like 2 a month and at most one a week. So yeah ok. This is cool.

@S_Tenuta no it's only a mild obsession that makes me lose sleep and I get all shaky when I don't play in over 8 hours #leagueoflegends
@S_Tenuta oh I could think quite a few
@S_Tenuta you're just using me for portillos...
@S_Tenuta you're right i took you to the good fast food. Portillos and noodles. Don't you think that's worth it... #thegoodshit
@S_Tenuta uh that must be your other boyfriend because I sure as hell didn't take you to Paris. I took you to mcdonalds and you liked it
@S_Tenuta wow ok I see what this is to you.

@MattStrau55 haha... Did that happen last night?
@MattStrau55 ...
@VW please let me drive it.

This gas station smells like farts
My phone capitalizes Black Friday...
@aaronpaul_8 was it your idea to put one of the greatest songs from the best band in the world in there?
:-/ so yeahhh
Wish @theglitchmob would play some league of legends with me.
@elscorcho86 you have too much fun with snap chat. It's not normal and it's not ok.
I got you @Lervin00 can't beat that ninja catch arrow flip with the charizard 
Why @LeagueOfLegends  why?! :( get your servers working
Well this is familiar...
Definitely not cool.
What... The FUCK
Lmao who the fuck gets pulled over by someone on a bicycle?!
Also I get my hair cut and I get much better tips .. This is a sign.
Being hooked up with free drinks. Awesome.
Saw the most beautiful blue audi s4 on I90
I hate my life right now
At our favorite place grandpa. I love you. 
Holy shit that's weird...
Today's gonna be really tough...
Happy birthday bum. I miss you. Wish you could still be around so I could buy portillos this time :(
@franklbanks when you coming up here?
Can't wait to see little jax again. Apparently he's huge now :(
Vacuumed washed and polished Emilio... SOOO MUCH NICER OMG.
Think I'm officially giving up. What more can I possibly do? Nothing so why bother.
Ugh tonight sucks
Ughhh
@VW trying to swindle me... On something that I used and worked in their own garage. Pretty smart of them.
So @VW tried telling my my e brake cable is broke so the brake doesn't apply... Funny cause I'm using it right now and use it every day #wtf
Whatever
@DanicaPatrick hi Danica. Can I go for a ride in the Lamborghini?
But really... Shut up. I mean it.
If you can't laugh then you should shut up.
At work this week I learned some people really don't have a sense of humor... Like they are boring. So why am I so shy? They should be
I would move to Brazil just you see muse at lolla then move back if that's what it took. I'm serious. This isn't funny or a joke I would
I should probably stop hanging on to everything.. :-/ this sucks.
@muse please please please come to lolla in Chicago this summer.
Gonna just move to Brazil. Might as well get out or here anyways and that's a far better reason to live somewhere.
Muse NIN AND arcade fire and did I say muse? Oh yeah and muse.... But holy shit
That Brazil line up for lolla is so perfect and looking hopeful for Chicago that my head could literally explode right now
Feels so un genuine and cold now...
I am literally losing my mind
Whatever I guess 
Kinda don't wanna wake up ever again.
Now I remember why I don't go out in Schaumburg much... they are everywhere. I swear it's an alien invasion
@MattBellamy did you time travel forward in to my life and then back to write the songs you do just for me? That's so thoughtful of you
Think I'm gonna go sleep for the next 75 years
Ugh... Sucks deleting the muse pictures too. Hate my life.
I have so much to offer and give and just feel none in return.
My grandpas birthday is in a few days too :-/
Even though idk why id be getting lied to. It's so messed up.
This is the worst feeling in the world... To feel such hope and also be so stressed and feel like I'm only being lied to
"The aids did come down in the mothership... In Roswell, it's a conspiracy" lmao
I guess you can never have expectations of people. Also common sense doesn't exist.
I didn't even do anything why am I embarrassed and ashamed?
So glad to be off work finally... Now I get to enjoy the rest of this shit day home in solitude
Who knew right?
I learned something today... Hypocrites are also (for lack of better words) groupies.
Glad some of us can get away with being sketchy. Piece of fuck.
@feedme just some sketching while I was waiting at the airport... 
@VirginAmerica the flight status on my plane out of LAX tomorrow is different on my phone and computer... Is 232 canceled of delayed?

@alysonpaigek don't the cubs have more touch downs?
STOP WITH THE COMMERCIALS! THERE'S MORE COMMERCIAL TIME THAN BREAKING BAD TIME

@aaronpaul_8 grandma, pizza, and breaking bad! #YEAHBITCH
@aaronpaul_8 this is the best thing ever, also what kind of Audi?
@SouthPark you guys gonna do anything with breaking bad ?
Ratchets all up in my business at work today.
When did people just refuse to control their kids? Uh hey woman, your kid is screaming way too loud tell him to shut up.
@Alienware  seeing an error in brought red letters on the boot up screen is hard right? It involves someone actually using their eyes.
Alienware is probably the worst computer and even worse customer support and technicians. Sent me back a broken computer. #attentiontodetail
@Em_gal I don't get Thomas the trains reference to the jeep thing...
I miss my favorite person in the whole world. @S_Tenuta come back :-(
@S_Tenuta what?
What is the deaf girl in weeds dancing to? She's deaf... I don't understand.
I wonder what a @theglitchmob remix of requiem for a dream would be like? Probably pretty awesome ehh?!?!
@deadmau5 did that flo commercial just jack a sound effect from perfect dark on the N64? Pretty sure it did, I played a lot of perfect dark
If your ginormous dont stand in the way of everyone trying to through. Like WTF? You know who you are! And you know your mass!
@franklbanks lol I just heard someone on the radio saying how its a good thing because there was a deal proposed that no ones agreeing on
@franklbanks what prophecies? She's not just overly religious but also brain washed and incredibly stupid
Neeeeed food!! Ugh
Why can't Burger King just serve breakfast all day? :-(
@SquareEnix wow you take 3 days to answer my support ticket and didn't even answer or help? Just closed the ticket? Good job. Refund please
If WE'RE bugs what does that make them to the larger specimen? Bacteria or atoms or cells or something?
When ever I squish an ant or bug, I think "what if WE'RE really ants to someone else much much larger?"
@rukes are you gonna be like spider man Where you rig your cameras to take pictures of yourself?
@CAZZETTE work makes me miss you AGAIN in Chicago, please do a show I can see soon. Or come in to my place of employment

@Ableton so the same snare I put in impulse makes a different sound every other measure? Why?!
Red R32 I just saw was saweet. Can't wait to get my VW back
The anger that happens when you pull out a triscuit that is broken in half is over 9000. #over9000
@red_Krist oh don't worry... I sabotaged them. They have no idea yet
@red_Krist this goes along with last night...
Wow Chicago. Are you kidding me? Waiting 45+ minutes for a blue line? Not getting enough money from everyone I guess? Idiots.

@Shaarawyat @Alienware very nice. I finally got my over priced computer working again. But guess what? Still lots of random lag spikes
@S_Tenuta no I rather be rich than famous.
@S_Tenuta ok... Ill do it for a million dollars

Oh you know... Typical day just @theglitchmob giving me production advice on my way to work 
@theglitchmob do you guys synthesize all these layers? I don't have a lot to layer and work with yet. But very well... MORE LAYERS!
I wish I knew what @theglitchmob use or do for their drums :-( ...They are amazing
Leave my guitars in the garage? WTF no! Are you crazy?!
Sometimes I get freaked out that when I fall asleep ill never wake up.
@S_Tenuta 
I just saw a license plate that said "pauly d" .... Something's gonna have to change in this world
Look at the new friend I made outside!!! 
@rukes @Zedd @djafrojack ill play cod with you guys
Not getting my next set of tires from discount tire That's for sure
So @DiscountTire lost my wheel lock last time and now can't replace my tire and apparently somethin happened last time I wasn't told about?
@deadmau5 lol at the bro raging at you in the comments about the ultra sets. He's so mad
Oh yeah work... Nevermind about my tire getting a hole in it. Yeah I'll somehow get there and back with no car. Yeah ok no worries
“@wolfganggartner: popped an ambien i'm sleepin” @S_Tenuta
@deadmau5 what do you do when you get creative blocks? Ever just do random shit and it works or have a method?
@googlemaps how long to get into Chicago using i90 if you start at Arlington heights?!
Does google ever look at its searches and think... "Wwwhat?"
HODOR #HODOR @HodorBot
@S_Tenuta I want portillos.
@deadmau5 #FREESNOWDEN
HODOR
@MordFustang hurry up and get to Chicago.
@S_Tenuta @bassnectar 
@S_Tenuta @SpringAwakeFest WELL THEY SAW MY TEXTS TO YOU BEFORE I EVEN MADE IT
@S_Tenuta @SpringAwakeFest big brother will come and get me :(
Made a #FREESNOWDEN sign for @SpringAwakeFest today. Shame it got hate on it on the way in but lots of love inside the fest. :)
@S_Tenuta we should all meet before with a bunch of free snowden signs and walk in past him
@Zedd HODOR!
Also that security guard for spring awakenking thinks that "free" is spelled "kill". Over payed for someone who didn't pass the third grade
@S_Tenuta @Zedd @shannnnonw @MLachica23 seen him 4 times now and not hourglass at one of them :-( but hope he liked our signs!!
@Zedd hey U PLAY HOURGLASS TODAY OR SO HELP ME!!!!
Just saw a cab tail gate and honk his horn at a horse carriage instead of going around it... Chicago cab drivers are smart.
Where the fuck did I park
@MattBellamy happy belated birthday!
"Babies with aids, babies with aids" #louie
@Zedd play hourglass at @SpringAwakeFest #PlayHourglass
A wild @S_Tenuta appears! Gonna have to use the master ball!
@S_Tenuta THIS IS DIFFERENT
@S_Tenuta NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
@S_Tenuta NO
@S_Tenuta YOU WISH YOU KNEW
DONT KNOW IF IM MAD OR UPSET!!' #gameofthrones
@RLotzer JUST MAKES ME SO MAD!!
@GameOfThrones WHY YOU GOTTA DO THAT?! UGHHH WHY!!! HATE THAT GUY !!
@S_Tenuta at least that would have been funny.
@S_Tenuta this tweet sounds like i asked you to do anal.
And I'll bring grandma portillos
I miss you grandpa. I'm coming to visit and wash our cars this weekend when the rain passes. Ill clean up after myself.
Grandpa you would be proud of me for getting this new job... Hope you can see it.
I just can't believe how fast something so permanent can happen.
I'm so happy I have @S_Tenuta here for me. Couldn't ask for a better best friend or significant other.
@S_Tenuta :-( what happened?!
@S_Tenuta :-) you give me too much credit. Of course I'm gonna be here for you!
Can't be at edc so I'm eating ice cream and watching Louie..:
@red_Krist she denies it but it was her...
@red_Krist and there was someone else with her. Another teacher who she was "dating" so I saw 2 very familiar people right next to me.
@red_Krist she. And yes she was!!' She was only like 24 or something at the time and I know she likes that band.
@red_Krist I saw Interpol there when I was a freshmen in high school and I swear my English teacher tried passing me a joint.
@red_Krist I love the rave. It's one of the best places.
@CAZZETTE also WTF no burgers.... If you went to kumas corner you would not say no burgers...
@CAZZETTE I forgot the name but there's a place in Ukrainian village on Chicago ave that's good. And had pitchers of awesome margaritas
Schaumburg traffic is awful
OMG game of thrones
OHHH I get it. They don't want to "sell out" of course!!! That's their thing or something. So THAT'S why... Well it explains everything
Riot fest should just have nirvana. If they had that one band it would sell out instantly. Why don't they do shows anymore?!
I didn't even know blink 182 was still around? Thought they died off when everyone in middle school got to high school.
Defeats the whole purpose of having those features
Stupid phones. Why should I have to proof read things that are "auto corrected" and use things like "smart text"
@Jeffywillis bored
Forever
Actually I take that back...I would also see bad religion. But only for like 25.8 minutes till I got board. Then I would leave the fest
The only band I like enough at riot fest to go see is the violent femmes...
@Rbry389 no chipotle is way better WTF how dare you
@Lennon2jen @s_tenuta I wish I've met the ones you have.
@steveaoki @scion maybe the dude just wanted a scion?
Looking for halo games, playing for pizza. Losing team buys winning team Pizza Hut. 2v2 #halo #pizzahut #pizza #nerd
@Rbry389 chipotles are everywhere and you can eat when you're not drunk unlike Taco Bell
@Rbry389 fucking... FUCK
@S_Tenuta why are you dreaming of the lanasters?!?! Were there wolves?! What else happened maybe you know the ending to the season
Support your local Indians! Go to subway...
@Rbry389 @southpark you haven't had chipotle before?
My girlfriend @S_Tenuta likes game of thrones so much she dreams about it, nerd! #gameofthrones #hbo 
HEY YA'LL Tuesday nights are boring, right?? Well spice tonight up! Come into Unos for Trivia Night! Drinks, snacks &amp; a good time! #Unos
@S_Tenuta that's not funny...
@S_Tenuta lol right? I cnt wait to work!! Now that it's good and worth it and something I can actually be proud of.
@S_Tenuta :-) I hope it's as good as it sounds
@S_Tenuta who did you tell that to? Lol
@S_Tenuta hey every second you spend favoriting my tweets is a second more you can be actually with me watching HIMYM
Can't wait to just start my new job already!
@TheGoodGodAbove smited !! Not smile
@TheGoodGodAbove If you smiled the 4 pounds cause they are wicked you could be doing 2 jobs in one. But still smite others for enjoyment
@alysonpaigek @s_tenuta DOES THE STORY END THERE
@alysonpaigek @s_tenuta OOO LA LA
@S_Tenuta @alysonpaigek wow Alyson you've really kept in touch

This is how real friends treat each other... #reallevels 
Wish I had my social security card on me and I could hve started my orientation while I was there!!
THE CITY IS IN MY NEAR FUTURE!

"Well I don't see any reason why we wouldn't h...." FINISH THE WORDS "hire you"

@S_Tenuta I gotchu
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?!
@S_Tenuta @sexfactsoflife knowledge is power!
The verdict is in... Poor Emilio :-(
Ugh can I please get a lucky break?! Seriously...
10 minutes in this turtle of a car and I already miss Emilio... Dude best fix him quick. #gli #carmance
@S_Tenuta now YOU can take ME out ;-) looking forward to it.
Can I just get a lucky break? Just a little bit?!
My new sounds: Home Sweet Home 
@S_Tenuta WHAT
Having someone that is there for you as much as @S_Tenuta is really special.
I hate today
:-/ ugh
On my way to my interview!! #nervous 
@TheGoodGodAbove why is it when I search "god" on twitter Oprah shows up on the list? She isn't god, nor is the letters d or g in her name
@S_Tenuta @alysonpaigek rude... YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE IN THE CITY WITH OUT MY PARTNER IN CRIME
@S_Tenuta @alysonpaigek thought that was implied lmao
@alysonpaigek @s_tenuta IM TRYING, trust me I want nothing more than to be there and in the city again.
So excited and nervous to have an interview tomorrow!!!!
@red_Krist it would probly be amusing to everyone else
@red_Krist are they at least amusing later?
@S_Tenuta I love you too!
Wow can the host at webber grill be any more rude?
@S_Tenuta they come to Chicago usually once a year.
@aaronpaul_8 I'm eating pizza for lunch. Thank you for the suggestion
I want bacon
@Zedd I've been talking about it for like 3 years it's hilarious, and that one guy is such a douche-a-tron
@infected I want to play it again right now.
@infected have you guys ever played mortal kombat on shrooms?
@deadmau5 so... Play some diablo?
@CAZZETTE any idea what time you're going to go on at @themidchicago on Saturday?
@red_Krist just go alone
@S_Tenuta hahaha
@MordFustang people should take more pride in what they make no matter how it sounds, it's a lot more rewarding
@MattStrau55 I get the same thing with allergies
@feedme subtle
@infected that should be what you guys sit in at your desk when making music... 
LOL... Really?! REALLY HBO?! 
BELIALLLLL I HAVE SLAIN YOUUUUU
Well this is just great!!! Fml
@red_Krist so how's your new boyfriend
@MattStrau55 @lollapalooza yeah WTF... The early bird was this morning
Miserable with our my partner in crime @S_Tenuta.
My new sounds: Next Track 
@S_Tenuta I wanna hear
HAHA 

My new sounds: Words are not enough 
I want an ocelot...
@NoelGallagher you suck
@red_Krist It's a new phrase, I invented it.
@MattBellamy I wish you would read a story I'm working on and tell me what you think of it.
@S_Tenuta @infected uh yes I already said that!
@S_Tenuta @infected rude... I feel so used
@S_Tenuta @infected uh yeah and of course no money because life wants to hold me down. So no VIP and vodka drinking like we said :-(
@S_Tenuta @infected if I was I would be outside the house of blues right now gosh. But I'm not cause our date sounds better... Sorry!
Why doesn't @infected wanna drink and party with me anymore? I can be fun!
@infected so before you invited me to VIP for a bottle of vodka when you came to Chicago...
Uh...WHAT... 
Well I should probably try and get dinner while places are open but I don't wanna go anywhere
Daft punk is so secretive that their website doesn't even do anything, just a page with one picture on it and no links...
@S_Tenuta NU UH.
My friends at work don't wanna talk to me cause all talk about is muse...
@muse it looks like @MattBellamy is very happy and @CTWolstenholme and @Dominic_Howard are awkwardly looking away 
@CTWolstenholme @chicagofire JEALOUS
Would have asked for a guitar to crucify my enemies.
It was so nice of @MattBellamy and @muse to give a drum stick to the fan that made a sign asking for one. I should have made a sign...
Hey @MattBellamy we shook hands during your Chicago show... Thank you it was nice meeting you.
@infected all this time I waited for a Chicago show only to have life make me broke... Come back soon please. Lollapalooza maybe?!
@S_Tenuta MY PLUG IN BABYYYYYY
@S_Tenuta :-( I love plug in baby. Oh well we shook his hands....
Weird... Muse didn't play new born OR plug in baby...
@Zedd if I were interviewing you we would be nerding out on Nintendo...
Hungry but don't know what I want!!!
I met Matt Bellamy
@Dominic_Howard next time can we get drinks with you guys?
@S_Tenuta THATS MATT AND I IN THE SAME PICTURE
.. Second show they played sunburn and @MattBellamy came down from the stage by us!
@S_Tenuta is my good luck charm... Tonight wouldn't have happened with out her. First show I took her too they played citizens erased...
Thank you @muse for making tonight the most personal and intimate show we've all ever been to!
I met my hero @MattBellamy today! Even if it was only for a second I did! 
At the front for @muse!!! 
@Dominic_Howard reminds me of the Kung fu master from kill bill... Bring him/her out to show us were in the front 
@infected can I have the heavy weight stems? Pleaseeee
@S_Tenuta AND SINCE YOU CAN'T TEXT BACK WHEN YOU BE READY
@S_Tenuta Just because I text YOU when I can doesn't mean I'm reading through all my feeds looking for daft punk news
@S_Tenuta uh yeah they are and I haven't been refreshing my twitter and readig it all with 2 long days back to back at work &gt;.&lt;
@S_Tenuta because no one on twitter or Facebook mentioned it? PLUS NO NOT REALLY.
@S_Tenuta YOUR WORK ALLOWS YOU TO STAY ON YOUR COMPUTER. SH
@S_Tenuta yeah I can because I'm not glued to snl on the chance that daft punk does that
@S_Tenuta work is like living under a rock :-(
And just yell....
I'm just gonna go outside and throw stuff because that's the only reaction my mind and body can do with this daft punk stuff...
UGH YEAH OK
@alysonpaigek we must both exist to bring balance to the universe.
@wolfganggartner I thought you were one? My bad bro!
@MordFustang how is the new one? I'm poor but I'm debating being more poor for that game.
@deadmau5 @thekatvond  "I did not hit her!! Oh hi mark"
@S_Tenuta oh she will.
@S_Tenuta ill give my grandma your number....
@S_Tenuta NO IT'S NOT
@S_Tenuta cut the tv off to their room and then make it uncomfortably hot
@S_Tenuta SHHHHH.
@Zedd Fill the next hotel room you get with them before you leave.
Was trying to buy minecraft but they hate IL and won't let me. Forget you I'm gonna go play with Legos now. #minecraft
@MordFustang what iPad apps do you use?!
@swedishousemfia #shmusa
What a happy day!
Up my Facebook feed and basically be forced to see your disturbing photos or whatever. It's ridiculous
But really... I rather hve green piece corner me and talk about saving whales (or whatever their problem is now) for 30 minutes than open
@S_Tenuta better go to a movie with me tomorrow because I wanna see django unchained REALLY BAD
Will people stop posting disturbing pictures on Facebook? It honestly makes me not care about your cause. It's worse than green piece.
#netflix should have a shuffle option for series
@muse @MattBellamy please play citizens erased for Chicago, we will go crazy and cause some serious craziness if you do.
MY NEPHEW JAX! 
@alysonpaigek nephew!
IM AN UNCLE
@S_Tenuta @muse @mattbellamy fucking fil
@S_Tenuta @muse @mattbellamy I MISSRD IT CAUSE FUCKING FIL DIDN'T SHOW UP TO WORK AND I DIDN'T HAVE EVEN A MINUTE TO LOOK AT MY PHONE
@muse @MattBellamy will you smash equipment and go crazy for your Chicago show?
Why is it so difficult to play mass effect 3 online? Takes forever to find a game then to join takes forever to join then its lagging
@infected you guys wanna give me lessons? Also you guys said you'd upgrade my Chicago ticket to VIP and to bring vodka to drink together.
Yeah ok sure.
Almost 12 hours straight with no break... But worth it.
@S_Tenuta come get lunch with me if I get a long enough break?
@Jeffywillis @s_tenuta @mattstrau55 
@S_Tenuta @MattStrau55 HEY ENTER IN THIS

@S_Tenuta yeah i figured id spoil you, but next time well get mcdonalds.

@S_Tenuta @feedme ok! We need to find a place with dollar beers of something before the show. THAT SHOHLD EXIST IN CHICAGO
Little surprised by this, but one of my favorites from his set last night.  
@feedme round 2! Hope the floor bends more than it did last night with everyone going insane!
@feedme why aren't you at bar Louie grabbing drinks before your show? Come by ill get you one.
@S_Tenuta you should feel right at home with your kind then

@S_Tenuta better hope that the tv's work today at work or she's gonna have a longgggg night
@Zedd I think you are more in to the Super Bowl than us Americans... Little strange
Schaumburg traffic is the worst.
Old people freak me out... For real

Just one tea spoon of super aids in your butt and you're dead in 3 years! 
 #southpark
windshield wipers are on 1, traffic is moving, and wind is at a whopping 10 mph and I was ditched because of the "storm" #stormofthecentury
@feedme @mordfustang Chea

Bipolar winter
gigawanamasonifonicon
@aaronpaul_8 They are the best! Come see them in Chicago too.
Um wtf?

It's like I can't sleep AND I'm not even doing anything productive!!! I can't even use the non sleeping time to do stuff I WANT to do
Insomnia and ADD is a horrible mix; it's such a waste. Like seriously...

Still awake. Probably going to get sick again.
If Anca is working at all tomorrow I'm gonna hate my life
Should just drive anyways, or suffer through Burger King

Ugh I don't wanna drive that far when my fucking check engine light is on! Stupid

Stupid hosts. "Wanna let me know when you're on?" "430" "well I mean like when it happens" "IT WILL HAPPEN A MINUTE AFTER 429" GO AWAY

Couldn't have asked for a better night. Pretty chill but very special,
@S_Tenuta surprised me with a visit tonight!!!! Made my day.
Dudes just go
Not a great day
This whole not sleeping thing caused mind I racing too much is torture
Can't even sleep now a days. And it's retarded how little it effects me physically.
Fuck it though. Just all over the place today. Idk if I'm pissed of what but I don't like it.
My new sounds: Stockholm Syndrom Midi. 
Ugh fine.... I don't even wanna know
Well that got my mind off things for a couple hours. I should just TRY and sleep.
Even noise and screams that @MattBellamy does through his guitars are beautiful. One of my favorite things.
Matt Bellamy "if I was 21 again? I would do exactly as I did I had a good time!" *Starts taking a drink of alcohol*
Hm... First completed sketch in years. Concept art. Gonna be rich when this shit is made. MONEY 
Ugh.... People should learn to go away.
Not going through this crap on top of everything else. Ugh. Whatever.
Ugh that better not be what I think.
"I'll eat your babies, bitch!"

Sick of hearing about the hobbit... NO I DIDNT SEE IT YET, GOD. SHUT UP
At least always sunny is on Netflix now...
So STUPID
Concept art more concept art MORE.
This is one of my favorite songs and probably the one a lot of other people find the most annoying.  
The amount of laziness in that last tweet is pretty bad. I didn't even type it Siri did.
Wish I had a remote for my computer so I could just start playing music and not get out of my bed so early
@S_Tenuta ACTUALLY A NEW GAME CAME OUT TODAY! DOWNLOADING IT NOW
"I'd bang you all night if I was a girl that got that" Uhhh thanks bill. Idk If that's awkward or not coming from a gay man

@MattBellamy hi
@Zedd NOO I missed the Q&amp;A?!
It kind of helps actually.
At work I just day dream about scenarios I wish would happen to make my day so much better. Fingers crossed!
I can think of lots of people that deserve a day instead of Aaron Rodgers. Today is stupid.
"What do you intend to do about this... 'First amendment' mister president" hahah
#SouthPark

Can't wait to get home and blast music super loud because I can
Two kills with one sniper shot. You all impressed by that? You should be
I wish @Zedd would teach me shit because I'm so overwhelmed I don't know where to begin
@Lennon2jen made ME upset.
@Lennon2jen maybe! It wasn't even a horrible experience. The cashier was just not friendly at all, and gave off a really bad vibe that
Uhhh 
Listening to @infected is awesome and makes you a better person in life.
Pretty sure I'm getting a tablet from Marni and Blake.... Wowwwww
@Zedd WOWWW... It's ok though, DOESNT sound as good as the original.
@Zedd shave it up is my new alarm because if I forget to shave my boss said hell send me home :-/

Really excited to spend then evening with @S_Tenuta !
T-watt 120... Top of the twats.
"Just say you have sporadic bowel movements and can't stay in confined public spaces for too long" - getting out of jury duty lmao
@MattStrau55 but what if I'm awake cause I'm hungry?! Idk why I'm even awake its bullshit
Why am I always hungry at Like 3 am
@deadmau5 wanna play some video games?!
WTF... New LoL patch sucks. WTF riot. #nerdrage
I kinda wanna do it again though. A couple short naps in a row should make you have super powers then.
Holy shit. A short nap really does energize you and make you feel better
@MattStrau55 @s_tenuta will do! But all this talk of bacon makes me really want some right now
I would turn down a life time supply of free bacon that cooks itself for @S_Tenuta.... If that's not some serious shit then idk what is
Our operator is off the train?! WTF KIND OF MESSAGE IS THAT?! WHO'S DRIVING
It's ironic that I chose a train during this race against time. I have no control what so ever.
In a race against time!!! IT'S EPIC
CITY IS CALLING ME. I think I'll just move the fuck back here. Fuck this lease.
@Lennon2jen kinda rude!

Ugh gotta work with the fucking witch today
WTF there's a siren going off?' WHY JUST LET ME OVER SLEEP AND BE LATE TO WORK. Ugh WHY IS THERE A SIREN
@red_Krist tap on the post

@red_Krist @s_tenuta I got nothin. Fuck
@red_Krist @s_tenuta yeah but thn what if the other person thinks that?!
@S_Tenuta @red_krist lmao pretty drastic assumptions coming from someone who never texts first.
@S_Tenuta @red_krist that still holds true to today.... Actually sometimes she thinks I died and asks If I'm ok.
@red_Krist lol! So you ARE a psycho. But maybe you DO care. I'm telling everyone.
@red_Krist has Sam ever told you how much I texted her? She always thought shed be bugging me or something.
@red_Krist haha it's not about that though. But I understand what you're saying. Just don't be like "WOW ASS HOLE CAN'T TEXT ME FIRST?!"
@red_Krist you should just do what you want! People like hearing from others.
What if Einstein invented time travel under nazi control first then time traveled back to escape Germany in time?
Lmao wowwww... Never proposing that way. 
Wow log into halo after a week an everyone changed my settings? Password now! Nerd rage!
#fuckingroommates

Would kill to have some food right now.... Especially portillos.
At least there will be alcohol.
Say everything*
Must be. That's rough..... So nervous I think I'll stupidly try an say everyone in one sentence or its all gonna come out in one word.
How do you possibly talk about EVERYTHING you've thought of in a whole week?! Ill forget shit.... Is this anxiety what sh feels every day?
@MattBellamy have you ever done something hurtful to someone you love?
@deadmau5 if you gave me a signed mau5head to give to the love of my life so I can try to win her back after I fucked up, that would be COOL
Sleep for work in the morning.. Or just keep working while I have creative juices flowing? 
#ableton #realproblems

This class is narrated by a speak and spell...
Don't drink over 45 beers in under 11 hours, thanks. I needed this to tell me that. Because I can also physically fit that in my stomach?
This online course is insanely lame and boring, but because it's about consuming alcohol it has my attention...
And now were all watching Johnny bravo... Priceless
My friend Krysti came from roscoe an cooked us all dinner...
For every quiz I pass on this alcohol class I hv to take for work, I'm drinking. Sounds like a good plan to me
Wtf... HOW HAVE I NOT HEARD GLORIOUS BEFORE?! I've heard a legit muse cover of creep. But their song glorious?! WTF IM SO MAD AT MYSELF
