Absolutely loved my dress. Wish I could wear it again. 
Now that I've bawled my eyes out from two movies I think its time for bed.
HBO on demand &amp; coke a cola is my ish right now.
I hate love movies cause they remind me how much of a hopeless romantic I am.
Just watched Endless Love &amp; its so sweet

And very very tired. Next two days I have off and I'm so excited
IM FUCKING HUNGRY
I don't put up with childish shit.
Girls are pathetic. Go ahead and get mad at me for "dancing on your man" when's hes been my friend for YEARS. Grow up.
He's one min from being late.
I'm so hungry. My delivery for my food is set at 9:05. Where's his bitch ass?
Nature is so peaceful
How precious 
Lmao when we stole Brendens car in high school. 
@bad_fysh weird. Just tweeted the same thing before I saw this
Always watch your back. Trust no one
I can't be with you if you're more than a girl than I am.
Love my mama more than anything on the planet. 
This is why I don't get my hopes up or count on you.
These cramps can go away any time now

@kelslynneee lmao. I can't do that
I haven't seen him in years. This is weird

One of these days Maya will unblock me from her phone. Lol just happy she's back in my life
Just leave me alone already fuck
Love having the money to pay for everyone's tickets at one time then just having them pay me back.
This bitch on TV killed her pregnant friend &amp; cut her baby out of her, then acted like it was hers. Wtf <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
I caught it on fire and that house blew up. It was crazy. I kept crying in my dream cause I brunt down gmas pretty house. Lol

@kelslynneee like no way in hell are you welcomed back here. At least not by me
@kelslynneee lmao. I know. Mom was like you're not gonna believe what your dad said &amp; I was just dumb founded.
My bank account tho &gt;&gt;&gt;
I mean I could always dip into my savings for my tattoo but I'd rather make the money and not touch my savings
I need to make like 700 to 800 this weekend. I have 100 down so far. Hoping my double at Tanners treats me good <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
After 5 years you realized you messed up. You made your bed now you're gonna have to lay in it.
You should totally get back with someone if it helps you with money. Fucking idiot. I'd leave in a heartbeat if she ever let him back in.
My dad tells my mom 'maybe we should get back together cause it will be better financial wise' brb. I'm dying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Woke up with scratches &amp; bruises. Like wtf did I do. Lol
Hoping I didn't act a fool, which I probably did.

I need to go back to my working 6 days a week &amp; doing less play
I hate when people buy me shit, spoil me, &amp; pay for everything but I better get used to it.
No matter what we are doing, if we are spending money he won't let me pay for it.
I get treated like a princess &amp; I love it even tho I'm not used to it.
Luv having money but hate having to spend it.
Closing both nights at Tanners this weekend &gt;&gt;&gt; <MONEY WITH WINGS><MONEY WITH WINGS>

"@BlakeJenningsss: @TotessToasst how did he line up a chick with no phone? Wait... 
@BlakeJenningsss lmao. He says it was your mom
@SadieHeinz haha yes. Glad I can do that for ya girl!
Matt fucked a girl in my bed while I was outta town. I can't get over it. Wtf
I guess I sound like his girlfriend or mom when I tweet about Matthew but thats just our friendship. Lol
Oh well its in the past &amp; I can't do anything about it. But Matt owes me
I'm appalled right now. I don't think I'd fuck in my friends bed. That's where I sleep!
I could <FISTED HAND SIGN><FISTED HAND SIGN><FISTED HAND SIGN><FISTED HAND SIGN> Matt in his face rn. Little asshole. Lol.
Wish I was going to Excision tonight
Don't even know if I feel like doing anything tonight #exhausted
Bra****
Just found a bar in my bed that's not mine..... Matthew has some explaining to do. #GrossedOut

Grab a friend and get a FREE Bloomin' Onion with any purchase thanks to @KevinHarvick. 
You wont find nobody else like me 
Cant believe I got this little man 2 years ago. Missed his birthday but he has now entered his… 
You probably shouldn't reproduce if you have no car, no job, no nothing!
Very glad I got to see my Aunt Gwen tonight. 
Def said that wrong
Told my lil bro I'd make him a drink &amp; said you won't even be able to taste the juice. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Being down here &amp; being around my family makes me want to move down here so bad.
@kelslynneee haha good point!
@kelslynneee haha yes. I can't take these two.
Grandma is crazy, smart-ass, funny, &amp; sweet all at the same time. Uncle Ed is just nuts. Haha
I wish everyone could meet my grandma &amp; uncle. Lol
Guy at the liquor store almost caught my bluff on my fake. Totally knew it wasn't me but still let it go
Bumpin some Tech rolling around OK.
These two are my world. 
Stillwater, OK is trying to outlaw hoodies... Whaa
<BLACK HEART SUIT> 
Bubba 
We have a back door in our hotel room that leads directly out to the pool. Hell yeah! 
One hour away <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I've been up for 29 hours. Holy shit. I'm gonna crash hard tonight
On the road to Oklahoma! 
Okay for real. Putting this stupid phone down &amp; going to do something other then move my thumbs. <VICTORY HAND><HEAVY BLACK HEART>&amp;<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
You probably wouldn't get a word in. Lol my mom has a long car ride with me.
Just imagine if any one of you were in person with me. I'd be talking your ear off.
Unless I drive first but I don't think I should drive cause I'm skattered brain right now. Haha
If I annoyed you with my rambling idc, if you were the least bit entertained with my thoughts that's cool. I'll be back in an hour or so
Ah fuck. Suns coming up. I think I may go clean out my car &amp; get it ready for the trip.
&amp; I'm starting school in the fall.. Didn't see myself going to college but I couldn't be more excited to go to school to do something I love
Not tootin my own horn but I am very happy with life right now &amp; how far I've come in the past 3 months.
I pay my bills, buy myself stuff, spend on others, help others, work all week, play harder, &amp; take whatever life throws at me.
Just cause I live at home doesn't mean I'm not independent.
A friend told me tonight after talking about life that he can see how I'm independent &amp; hearing that made me so happy.
I don't need anybody who doesn't need me. <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
I still have love for my dad. Respect? None at all.
Only time he had anything to say to me was negative; about my tattoos, cigs, drinking, sayin I degrade myself. HA FUCK YOU.
I wouldn't be so against my dad if he knew half the person I am.. I tried to have him in my life but just seemed he didn't care
So going down to see family in OK. The only person I will not be seeing is my dad. Kinda sad but that's how the cookie crumbles
Only reason Im so deep in thoughts is cuz I talked about life for a few hours tonight &amp; I just feel so happy about the past, recent &amp; future
So I might be on an addie &amp; bored &amp; have to leave in an hour for Oklahoma &amp; I have no one to talk to so Im gonna tweet #SorryNotSorry
Good or bad I like my life &amp; the person I am. Some may disagree but I only have to make myself happy.
No one has a perfect life, &amp; you're not gonna live one. What you go thru is either gonna make you or break you.
&amp; what I love more is getting to know them &amp; hearing what they've seen/done &amp; seeing the awesome person they are today.
I literally love the group of people I've became friends with. They are all so awesome, caring, fun, &amp; great.
Alicia Keys can get it any day
You can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
I know I'm the outkast but I could really care less.
I'm starting to dislike people more &amp; more.
A straight forward picture doesn't do it justice. Heres my newest addition (: (: 
Will be picking up a few Saturday nights at the bar in the next weeks

First time cooking chicken. #BigGirlStatus
Hmmm
These dogs are really making it hard for me to get up. I wanna lay in bed on this rainy day but I also need to do stuff..
I wanna go get breakfast
Anyone wanna tell me why I'm up at 9am?? Lol
Haha I love Javi
I got 1 mexican, &amp; 2 black dogs in my bed.. I think I'm the minority
I think I have to be sober when I do it.. When I'm drunk I get distracted easily &amp; being high I just wanna eat food &amp; watch TV. Lol
So my room didn't get cleaned like planned last night... So take 2 tonight
I'm only human
One of the greatest feelings is coming home to some pups who love you unconditionally &amp; who are… 
Lmao. Remember this night? Haha @si_errrra budzene18 
Going to clean my room while drunk.. Might even have a glass of crown. We'll see how this goes.
Nights with this girl &gt;&gt;&gt; 
Luv my Octavious 
I need a vacation. I need to get away, even if its for a weekend. Tired of how much I work but I love how much money I have.
Tomorrow is a new day
I'm very annoyed &amp; pissed rn.
I don't want to assume u did me dirty but all the signs point to you.
Can't trust anybody these days.
My sweet boy came to cuddles 
I do love Vegas bombs tho
Sister, sisster 
One of the few guys I can count on. 
Bars are fun but they take all your money.
I don't think I'm gonna like going out when I'm 21. You spend way too much money &amp; u don't even remember it.
I haven't had a drink in 3 days.. That hasn't happened in awhile. I think its time for a cold one
Life is too short, so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot 
Cause I wanna drink so I guess I'll drink by myself. Party of 1
I sometimes wish I had more friends
18 hour shift kicked my ass but definitely walking out satisfied <MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG>
@CiSwaggy omg. Reading that made me clinge. Oucchhhh. Hope everything goes well &amp; for a quick recovery!
I usually don't remember my dreams but here lately I've been having vivid dreams &amp; its weird.
Lifetime movies are always the best
Painting nails tonight &amp; being productive tomorrow. So happy I have my car back. #FreeBird
This year I'm just gonna live life to the fullest &amp; do everything that I want to do/been wanting to do.
The money I make on St. Patty's will be going towards my VIP Wakarusa ticket <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Buzz Beach Ball is in full effect. I cant wait! 
Let me show you the shape of my heart <TWO HEARTS>
Just now getting off. Can't wait till I'm 21 so I can sit down at the bar &amp; eat.
Shit is so annoying
I really wish I could stop time &amp; just sleep for 24 hours.
@adrienne_bartXo omgsh yes. I know your pain girl. It fuckin sucks &amp; I just wanna go crazy.
@KassadeeGricher that's a good idea. Might have to do that next time I clean cause I never follow thru. Lol
The night I wanna go out no one does but I do it anyway.. The night I don't wanna go out everyone wants to &amp; I end up going anyways.
Breaks my heart that my lil bro feels the way he does about certain situations.. I will not leave his side &amp; I'll make sure 2 bring him up
I hate depending on my friends and family.
Life is testing me
I really can't tell how 2015 is treating me.
Gonna junk my car, and get a new one. #OverIt
I'm so annoyed.
I'm really hoping you were just drunk talking
Words hurt.
He said I like this drunk, I've never been this kind of drunk. He's so loopy. The roles have switched.
Matthew has never drank wine before &amp; he's mixing orange juice with it. Lol. Hes so drunk its funny.
@SydneyVanfleet miss you too bebe. <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@SydneyVanfleet that's so exciting! Congrats Syd!
Most of you know my love for minions so when I came across this phone case I couldn't say no. It… 
Here's a sneak preview.

"@xoKarlieRose: We all outgrow things &amp; people as we get older &amp; that's not a bad thing."
I can't wait for this cruise in February.
2 cups and I feel like I can take over the world
Coffee is so awesome
Had some nice heart to hearts with my sister last night. Successful girls night.
@BlakeJenningsss it was only cause we were playing slow music but now its up beat <DANCER>
@BlakeJenningsss feelings are gone now. Lol. Just in the moment. Miss you buds.
I absolutely love that my sister and I have become so close, couldn't ask for a better person by my side. We need each other.
Honestly, I love the person who I am &amp; the person I am becoming. The things I've been through have made me who I am &amp; I'm okay with it.
I can thank my so called father for that.. He thought I should be the one to always talk to him first.. It works both ways buddy.
I'm the type that if you don't put effort into it then why should I? You don't care, then why should I?
I think about a certain friendship everyday, &amp; I always think or get reminded of them so that should tell me something huh?
Words can be unsaid, and forgiveness is a thing so why just let something go if it can be fixable?
Life's too short to hold grudges or fight with someone over some petty stuff.
Paid off my loan <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><OK HAND SIGN>
So going to Buzz Beach Ball this year
Thinking its time to start my sleeve soon <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Cute. Lol
I don't hate you boy, I just wanna save you while there's still something left to save.

@Hozier was beyond amazing last night. I didn't want the night to end. Such a beautiful person on the inside &amp; out
Hanging out before Hozier (: 
It must be a sister thing cause we are always matching in some way &amp; we never plan it 
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth

Asked my mom for a wash cloth &amp; my exact words were "cloth wash" ....
&amp; I'm glad he learned from my mistakes.
Obviously there is nothing wrong with pot but from experience a 14 year old boy who loves sports shouldn't have any part of it.
I'm very proud of my little brother, he's been in situations where he could've smoked weed but he chose to walk away
Sometimes you have to let go of things even if you're not sure about it but just know things will always work out how its suppose to be
All I want is a car that doesn't give me any problems.
Mom &amp; Matthew are making tacos
He even asked me where my beer belt was. Lmao
Collins from Jack in the Box just recognized me as the girl in the onesie... Lmao.

"@reIatabIe: looking at my bank account like

All I need is a new battery, a new power steering pump, a new hose, &amp; belt then my sweetheart will be all fixed up.
Not sure what to do with my car.. I have 1400 left to pay on it &amp; I'm gonna need about 800 or a little more to fix it.

Hi
OK I think my rant is over. Ungrateful little shit
I'm so annoyed right now. My mom is gonna have it hard whenever I move the fuck out.
She seriously just drove to Buckner to take his friend home and now driving out to town cause he doesn't want sonic or subway.
My mom should be a lot harder on him considering she's always running out of money.
My little brother is so ungrateful and gets whatever he wants. It drives me nuts
Looking for a stranger
My throat hurts I better not be getting sick. I'll kill someone.
Staying home all day is not healthy for me.
But I'm so full from eating all day &amp; I'm still craving something to eat.
I want some candy, or some cookies
I love lifetime movie network
My phone needs charged but I'm gonna wait till it gets to 1% to get up to get the charger

Spending money on me car is annoying
A Buckner cop got behind us as we were driving home with a brake light out and didn't pull us over... Whaaaa?
My life is like one thing after another &amp; I've learned to deal with that, but I know my day will come when its easy sailing

Ramble, ramble, ramble. I'm weird guy rn
I was gonna pick up a shift but considering I haven't went to sleep yet, I don't think that's happening.
I suppose I should try &amp; get some sleep &amp; that doesn't work out, I shall be productive in some sort of way
I'm not sure what's going on lately but my dogs have been gas machines &amp; I'm grossed out. Lol.
My morning was pretty sweet. Enjoyed movie &amp; snuggle time.
&amp; at this point I'm not sure if I'm tired or if I want to be productive.
I can't remember the last time I stayed up for 24 hours.. it was probably in hs or middle school.
The Green Mile is a great movie.

My boy Matt is getting back in the game. Happy to hear he's going on a date (:
Like obviously you can see he's not in here by looking thru the glass window idiots, but thank you for making me get up
Hate when people knock on the office door when they need a manager &amp; I'm in here by myself.
You can see in my eyes that I'm looking for a cutie pie.
Which sounds like an awesome thing to do tomorrow.
I so need to go buy a new pipe that I can carry on me.
My mcm goes out to my two boys. Hahahaha sorry fellas

Being on vicodin &amp; serving is pretty awesome. I love it.
When I get emails from Twitter it always starts off with dude &amp; I chuckle every time. Lol.
I sometimes dislike living in Buckner.
Knew I should of picked something up to eat before I came home.
I do not feel good
@bigcoop2111 you
It's gonna be very hard to stop smoking but I can do this.
I will be moving from Missouri in my future, somewhere close to a beach cause that's where I belong.
If it could stay spring or fall temperatures all year round I wouldn't complain.
I don't want summer to end, only because I don't want winter to began.. I hate the cold
But I'm extremely excited to go to Bassnectar :D
Wish I could be going to buzz beach ball today
I love the people I surround myself with. Yall are awesome (:
Happy birthday @dakota_dlot (:
Matthew and I this morning (: 
Don't get me wrong, classic rock is good but not when one of your friends plays it all the damn time.
I see all these girls with big, nice, asses and I'm like why couldn't I be blessed with some ass?
So proud of my real nails. 
I paid more for the shipping then the actual belly button rings. Rings were 99 cents, shipping was 6… 
Watching Divergent and I cant get over how handsome Theo James is. It hurts me how good looking he is.… 
I'm going to stop smoking cigarettes, and I mean this when I say it. Starting today.
So happy with how much I made at work tonight.
