what i would have given to be at vector arena right now watching the backstreet boys <BROKEN HEART>
looking cute, feeling cute 
@Setsfiend dude i have stuff to do, i can't spend a day on this pointless conversation
@KidmanMakino i have muted you by the way. i feel like we'll just go around in circles, but i do find your words offensive. the end.
try to reinforce 'masculine' and 'feminine' stereotypes. the line is blurred and it should stay that way. stop trying to box people.
i grew up feeling like i didn't belong under the stereotypical definition of what a little girl should be. i have no patience for those who
@KidmanMakino i played with a mixture of female and male directed toys. please stop reinforcing gender stereotypes. goodbye.
@KidmanMakino and i'm saying that they should not be because that is harmful to children
@KidmanMakino this is 2015, what decade did you come from? get with the times darling. many young girls do.
@KidmanMakino how old are you? i am 20 years old and there was no gender barriers on television shows etc when i was a child.
@KidmanMakino not everything is or should be directed towards young boys. that's why your tweet was sexist.
@KidmanMakino because you completely disregard the importance of marvel toys embracing and encouraging strong female role models
@KidmanMakino for, so please, do not bother. as a young woman, you are barking up the wrong tree here.
@KidmanMakino hello, you do not even follow me, so why are you trying to contribute to my tweets? i find this response sexist and uncalled
@KidmanMakino loose skin
what the actual fuck 
@KidmanMakino i don't know what you're talking about, sorry

@_michaelajayne @WeAreMKTO haha good morning
yes clearly you are mentally fucked up, that is not an excuse. you're still guilty and you still deserve to rot in jail. <RAISED HAND>
you know what i dont understand? how people can genuinely believe that 'being insane' is a legitimate excuse for committing horrific crimes.
that's a big deal for somebody who's been 170cm since she was 16 and has two brothers and a father over 6ft
exciting news: apparently i am taller than i used to be <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>

.@rickygervais is literally the celebrity out there at the moment doing the most for animals and i have so much respect &amp; admiration for him
i'm late to the party but ed's music video to photograph has got me so emotional
@Betty_Blue_x just stop. please. i'm done. its not about you and i and our different views on the matter. it's a tiny drop in a big ocean.
@writingforart hey, thanks for your input in that conversation. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@Betty_Blue_x you're making this all far too personal to you. right now, its about austin jones' victims. supporting them is what matters.
@Betty_Blue_x i get what you are saying and i understand that your intentions are good, but honey, you're missing the point entirely.
i am angry and i am ashamed and i am sorry to everybody who has experienced some form of sexual harrassment or abuse. i am here for you. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@Betty_Blue_x how the fuck are other people going to be warned though huh? if its not made public?
almost taught that we belong to men, to take any and all advances as a compliment. no. you are a wildfire and you choose who you burn.
i used to find it really difficult to say no to people, especially men, and it put me in a lot of uncomfortable situations. as women, we are
don't let anybody intimidate you into silence. you own your body and nobody has the right to touch or see it without your permission.
to talk about. we will support you in any way that we can. there is no shame in it. let your voice be heard in order to protect others.
hey. if you've been sexually harrassed, or just generally made to feel uncomfortable by somebody, i want you to know that it is okay for you
anti-feminism, rape culture, victim blaming... i can't fucking deal with it all. the world is terrifying.
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart look up to, who are significantly older and should know a hell of a lot better.
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart well that's you. this isn't about you. this is about these young girls being manipulated by people who they
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart you're literally describing a major part of rape culture right now
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart uh no because awareness is important
@writingforart @Betty_Blue_x come forward about it without being ridiculed or shamed.
@writingforart @Betty_Blue_x and it keeps happening with so many different people. it's important that we make victims feel like they can
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart you think the victims sit there thinking 'oh yeah it's over and done' ? no. it's them that matter.
@Betty_Blue_x @writingforart i'm talking about the new allegations that keep coming to light constantly.
@writingforart @Betty_Blue_x YES THANK YOU. WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM.
@Betty_Blue_x you can't seriously tell me that you can turn a blind eye to people praying on underage girls or boys. thats fucked up.
@Betty_Blue_x well that's really unfortunate
or just making them feel uncomfortable. there are no excuses for that. IT IS PAEDOPHILIA, IT IS ILLEGAL, IT IS GROSS.
i feel like every fucking month we find out that some seedy as fuck youtuber or band member or whatever has been abusing their fans
caN WE PLEASE STOP EXCUSE THE DISGUSTING PAEDOPHILIA BEHAVIOUR OF 'SEMI-FAMOUS' MEN

ITS NOT OK TO INTIMIDATE YOUNG GIRLS FOR SEXUAL GAIN

if you think there might be something psychologically wrong or different with you, go see a professional !!!!! don't just google it !!!!!!
also, a reminder that just like how you should never google symptoms, you should never diagnose yourself with a mental illness/disorder !!!!

things i need: my heater turned on, cough lollies, a vanilla viennetta.
@taylorrwilkie well i would recommend that you don't bother wasting your time on them because that is beyond fucked up.
@taylorrwilkie @salsamatty the fuck sort of females are you talking to?
bruised, sick and miserable. yup, totally living the dream.
@Jack_Ladd_ @MarvelUK and yet i know nobody who does
drew barrymore literally has the best redemption story in hollywood and we don't talk about it enough.
there are actors out there, like drew barrymore and keanu reeves, who have lived such fascinating lives and yet we sweep them under a rug.
how unfortunate is it that we focus on the way celebrities look and who they're dating as their 'oh so interesting personal life'.
@megterry_x why does your 8 year old cousin even have instagram?!
protect the women in your life. protect the men. protect everybody who doesn't fall into those labels. just, love and embrace them.
also while we're on it, calling somebody a 'slut' has no ground. its a thing that doesnt exist. the whole idea was created to oppress women.
it's fucking hard out there for young women. we should be raising them up and encouraging their sense of worth, not dragging them down.
it doesn't matter what somebody wears, how many people they sleep with, what photographs they post online, you have no right to shame them.
i am not whatsoever here for privileged, misogynistic people trying to own us and control what we do with our bodies.
i am absolutely, 100%, here for people being confident with themselves and being in charge of their own bodies. especially women.

@Betty_Blue_x aw no i'm good, just sucks that i have to leave so much behind <CRYING FACE>
@giffyleto same
i have two days to pack my entire life into a suitcase. well. this is where i start crying.
@giffyleto you're going to have such a good time
i'm really struggling with this 'not allowed to shop for stuff that i don't need' thing
@giffyleto DON'T
backstreet boys playing in the warehouse. yes. thank you.
seven days.
@AlexAllTimeLow hey dude. sorry that words can get so badly misinterpreted in the twittersphere. i for one appreciate your compassion.
i'm so sad that so many good make up companies either test on animals or use animal bits and pieces in their products <CRYING FACE>
also i just forgot how to pronounce the word 'colonial'.
when you get all ready for work and then your boss tells you that they don't need you anymore. oh. what do i do with myself now?
jealousy. 
We had a good run, but this is where I leave you. Thank you for braving the Boston winter with me. I miss you al‚Ä¶
we don't talk about drew barrymore enough. she is living proof that it can always get better.

@x_hannahjackson goodnight x 
@x_hannahjackson ok i need to sleep now i'll let u ponder that
@x_hannahjackson always 
@bradieeeex_ well that's ridiculous
@x_hannahjackson 
@x_hannahjackson are u stalking me 
@bradieeeex_ what? they're playing STB
i feel like we need to stop the stigma against therapists and counselling bc honestly, its so important to be able to talk to a professional
it is 11pm on a monday night and i am looking up cheap counsellors in london because i might need one and theres absolutely no shame in that
holy shit i cannot wait to see this live 
of all the things i am insecure about in this world, my writing is the biggest and omg am i really doing this
i just linked my very terrible in development music website to my facebook page and i am about to cry
the whole website is very much under construction but hey i wrote a review on the @ddlovato concert last night 
@CLIFFOLLESE journalism is the fucking worst
@coupdemain truuuuuu
@coupdemain i mean it's more her touring people than her but still, that's pure exploitation <PENSIVE FACE>
fuck now i don't want to go
so one direction's playing STB then????
@writingforart yup. all the ones i tried to go to. mayfair is one of the most expensive parts of london. some of camden is free.
@writingforart it costs like $20 to get in anyway tho like rly
@writingforart omg gurl <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@writingforart don't worry it ain't that great
there's a lot to be said for how much singers and bands charge for meet and greet/VIP concert tickets.
@coupdemain WHAT
people should tell each other that they love them more often. but also, why.
"#STB venue and date announced" as if it's not always at wembley
i truly cannot wait to get the heck away from these inconsiderate af dudes i live with
did i really just cheer on a wolf ripping apart a dude's neck what is this show doing to me
there's so much i was supposed to do today. have i done any of it? nope. not even remotely.
why is everybody on game of thrones so beautiful but mostly how does richard madden look like that
i am about to watch game of thrones for the first time
@giffyleto fuck my life
@giffyleto sAME
@giffyleto oh dammit i leave at 1:30 <BROKEN HEART>
@AllTimeLow @AlexAllTimeLow hi are you having fans on stage for time bomb at reading / can i be one of them please?
@giffyleto what time / can i maybe come see you at the airport
@giffyleto hi what day are u flying up to auckland
@pacifierjesse ya if u click just to the side of the photo a X comes up to delete it
@pacifierjesse click on it
do you ever just wish you could say to somebody "hey you're not a very nice person and a super shitty friend" bc me right now
i do have to spend $120 on a UK railcard and a UK license tho so i might cry at some point
the best thing about not having to pay for your flight to london: money to treat yourself with. i just splurged on $7 earrings.
it's a wet hair, mens singlet and ripped jeans sorta day 
@tildaswagton @TearawayMag @ddlovato she's a proper little rock goddess
@tildaswagton i just know a lot of women who do, which is what he will be. idk man, i personally didn't find it insensitive.
@tildaswagton @TearawayMag @ddlovato but i don't know a single transgender person who actually acts like that or says those things, do you?
people who wear animal bones as some sort of bohemian jewellery trend:

don't
@tildaswagton @TearawayMag @ddlovato yeah dude it was incredible
@tildaswagton @TearawayMag @ddlovato but in america that's literally the real housewives stereotype.
it's like mean girls cliques all over again and i am very much not down for making people feel excluded
not sure if i want this whole 'squad' thing to stop because it's fucking annoying or because i'm not part of any 'squads'

or maybe both
this is so lovely, can we do this with every major singer or band that performs here? 
does anybody have a good quality photo of demi from last night's auckland concert that i could use for my review? will give credit.
@edsheeran what if you're simultaneously good and shit at something?
@TearawayMag @tildaswagton @ddlovato awkward. here i was thinking bout the real housewives when she said that bit in her speech.
@x_hannahjackson stop being so cute i'm emotional enough
@x_hannahjackson love you too. but you already know that. x
at the end of the day, long distance just doesnt work unless all parties make the effort. dont waste your energy on those who dont repay it.
okay i'll stop venting. it's raining and i'm being philosophical.
it's rough to know i'm sacrificing almost all of my kiwi friendships when i leave next week, but i'm just hoping it'll be worth it.
something i've been continuously learning it's that you cannot force people to want you around, to care for you the way you wish they would.
my entire life has consisted of being hurt by the people i care for and i don't think that's something you ever get used to, but if there's
my personal life lately has been all about disintegrating friendships and putting my time, love and energy into people who don't deserve it.
celebrities will take photos with you if you ask politely and wait patiently. mobbing them and not even saying two words is just rude.
i work in the celebrity world and i don't want my whole life to become it so i'm changing a lot of things, starting with twitter.
i dont know what flipped in the mind of society to suddenly decide that a celebrity is a prize, something to show off, but im not ok with it
i'm not doing the fangirl thing anymore. i don't agree with it and i am ashamed to be a part of it. they're people, they deserve respect.
Demi singing catch me last night got me like <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@adorablemcvey have u seen everybody posting selfies in it tho? it's greeeeeat.
it's all fun and games till the weather stops your tv from working
@sarah_mifsud_ i win
@sarah_mifsud_ well a flight to london is over 24 hours so
@sarah_mifsud_ uh london
serious question: when did 'meeting somebody' change from actually meeting somebody to just getting a photo with them?
@sofetchconn ((okay cool thank u!!))
@writingforart but you have to get there first <GRIMACING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sofetchconn ((when's the first line up thing being announced?))
@sofetchconn ((okay))
@writingforart @bigtimekiwi ew but have you looked outside?

"small tornadoes possible" looks like i'm not leaving the house today
@writingforart @bigtimekiwi it was prerecorded yesterday wasn't it?

@cadygroves you are such a beautiful and inspiring woman and i feel blessed that @_michaelajayne brought you into my life.

@x_hannahjackson we are pretending like it didn't happen hannah
@alexanderdeleon what's your favourite song you've ever written?
i feel like the storm outside is trying to tell me that i need to pack today
@x_hannahjackson but it's okay now.
@x_hannahjackson oh i just basically lost the plot. couple of panic attacks, a lot of crying, thought about jumping off a bridge...
@sarah_mifsud_ well of course they are essentially the stars of the movie
@x_hannahjackson oh u missed a fun time
and suddenly i'm thinking about kit harrington again
@sarah_mifsud_ um excuse me did u see dave
@sarah_mifsud_ DISHONOR ON YOU
@sarah_mifsud_ i was more a dave the laugh kinda girl

@ShonaBellingham tru. and i'll never forget how lovely yah'll were to me <FACE THROWING A KISS>

its a bit sad that i've been to over 20 concerts in my time but at least 18 of those i went by myself
my aesthetic is feminine mini dresses and my brothers' hand-me-down hoodies
@radicalcliffvrd because deep down, in reality, you don't want to die. because i feel the same.
@Betty_Blue_x yas sounds good omg
@Betty_Blue_x i'll try! x
@giffyleto win me this 
i leave new zealand in nine days. i have no idea when i'll be back. that's scary.
today i have to start packing for england and i am getting super emotional
okay lets pretend like this morning didn't happen and that i'm not completely psychologically fucked up
well it feels like i just got punched in the stomach
love and thoughts to nepal and all surrounding areas. what a devastating disaster, i cant even begin to imagine what they're going through <TWO HEARTS>
i feel like the important question/s to ask are who wants to come to harry potter world and/or disneyland paris with me next month?
bringing this back 
you can't ever tell me that cats can't sense when you need a bit of love 
do you ever just get a craving for hugs
jeremy renner, mark ruffalo, elizabeth olsen and josh widdicombe on the graham norton show got me crying from laughter
@NatalieTW_ @JoshUJWorld @JJUJWorld @JaymiUJWorld @georgeujworld why is josh's hair wet / why did i think george was nathan sykes at first
I'M SEEING DEMI LOVATO PERFORM LIVE TOMORROW THO OMG
if i start watching game of thrones tonight will i have nightmares
20 years old and i still haven't quite grasped the whole 'feminine' thing. #onlydaughterproblems
the fact that i've spent my entire life living with men and soon i'm going to be living in a house of just women is terrifying.
@writingforart WILMERS HERE?!
@bigtimekiwi she seems smaller than usual
@writingforart @ddlovato nah she will don't worry
"being mean to katherine is like kicking a puppy." somebody actually said this about me today.
yo kiwis

DO NOT MOB DEMI LOVATO

DO NOT WAIT OUTSIDE HER HOTEL

GIVE HER SOME GODDAMN SPACE AND LET HER CHILL
does anybody know what time the vector arena box office opens on the day of a concert?
@jamareoartis because nobody has ever really talked about it so publicly before and thats important.
#BruceJennerABC

@giffyleto i could've told u that
WHAT THE FUCK THEY ACTUALLY KILLED OFF DEREK?!?!?!?!?!
i feel like everybody in this world has that one famous person that they admire and adore more than anyone else. for me it was heath ledger.
hey does anyone in london want work at twickenham for the rugby world cup? lemme know and i might be able to hook u up.
everybody at work today seems to be in a terrible mood and i'm not down for it
@writingforart for any concert in new zealand that's cheap tbh
@_michaelajayne @writingforart oh what no i can theyre just $90 <UNAMUSED FACE><SLEEPY FACE>
@_michaelajayne cheers dude but i got sent the email too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@_michaelajayne @writingforart nah it's literally seats at the top at the back
@writingforart it's the worst seats tho
so apparently i'm an acting agent now
@writingforart aww bb, have you tried ringing/texting him? i'm sure he's fine x
@writingforart monday is
you don't need to be offended by every little problematic comment to be a feminist or even just a decent person so can we pls chill
to be honest, in context, i don't reckon what chris and jeremy said about black widow was particularly offensive. it wasn't said seriously.
@ActorTrivia it's jaime
am i the only one who gets super uncomfortable when fans sexualise actors/singers/band members? it's so creepy.
@5SecxndsOfLemon hey so thanks for the offer but turns out i wont be in london till the 5th so never mind <PENSIVE FACE>
@gwenn77 thanks for the offer but considering exchange rates, i think that's a bit much for me to pay atm. sorry x
is it bad that i kind of can't wait to get jetlag so i can finally get a decent nights sleep
life lesson for you all: two damaged people cannot have a healthy and balanced relationship. do yourself a favour and stay away from them.
re: the new avengers film

one of my least favourite things about hollywood is how they keep romanticising unhealthy relationships
only two more 5am wake up calls till i move to england thank goodness
remember when ryan reynolds and sandra bullock won best kiss but he couldn't be there so sandy kissed scarlett johansson instead
friendship/relationship goals 
i'm so here for ladies who are just completely confident in themselves and their bodies, regardless of what anyone else thinks.
@itssschony omg i didn't even know it was on netflix but boo <PENSIVE FACE> you can still stream it online tho.
@itssschony just a warning: there is a scene in season 2 episode 9 with monica that i found quite traumatic (but maybe that's just me) <CONFUSED FACE>
@_michaelajayne i totally forgot that robyn sung it but yeah it sounds like a completely different song sung like that <OK HAND SIGN>üèª<OK HAND SIGN>üèª
@_michaelajayne HIS VOICE IS SO GOOD AND SO DIFFERENT I LOVE IT
i'm so in awe of that dude on BGT who sung dancing on my own / got simon's golden buzzer <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@gwenn77 yes, possibly. how much are you wanting for it/what sort of ticket is it?
@itssschony oh shit sorry <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@itssschony is ian gonna break my heart tho
@itssschony actually, i still haven't seen the last three episode thanks for the reminder <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
what should i watch though?

(chris really wants me to start game of thrones but do i have the energy?)
we're in the car and my brother keeps saying "you know nothing jon snow" over and over again.
family lazy days 
@writingforart then ya definitely make the most of it, it's just a super random place to visit let alone hold a festival <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@writingforart ohhhhh okay
i'm so tired i just fell asleep on my brother's makeshift bed and drooled all over myself woops
@writingforart ......why are you going to wolverhampton?
@h0eniq YO ME TOO
operation pull chris evans is go 
so chris evans is only 13 years older than me and single, do you know what this means?

i have a chance
i always forget how few people actually want to spend time with me because i think i'm pretty great but then i'm reminded and its like "oh."
@jillmariex omg

hey it's 9am and i'm still in bed and i am freaking out
i feel like we need to give every celebrity a sign that says "hey i'm a human being not some animal you prod at the zoo."
considering i work every day in the media industry, god i really fucking hate the media industry.
@Jake_Rixton are you going to work behind the register at sainburys?
@writingforart i know right. we get the photos at work and we're just like "fuck."
@Isxbelleee if it's that bad, organise an appointment with a professional who can explain the mentality of it all to your mother.
@Isxbelleee that doesn't mean you have to generalise every single person. because that's how you never get better.
hey @krishgm, a person's past faults do not define them. dragging up somebody's past without consent is incredibly disrespectful.
@Isxbelleee well that's rude
@writingforart yeah two separate migrant boats capsized within a week, killed over 1000 people <CONFUSED FACE>
@writingforart hahaha i know that feeling but no i'm all freaked out woops
@writingforart nah, there's been more than malaysian. also the biggest boating disaster in recent times was last week. scary innit.
@writingforart
@writingforart but we've been having so many serious aeroplane accidents lately as well
@writingforart plus can you imagine not having planes and having to catch boats to other country omfg no
@writingforart but realistically the world is too big for that. i totally agree it'd be great but just not possible. haha
the way that the media has been treating bruce jenner over this rumoured gender transition is absolutely disgusting and it should be ashamed
@writingforart ......how'd we get around tho? people just need to learn how to drive properly and not drive while under the influence.
so hey, i'm sick.
@_stephhunt @giffyleto I'M SO UPSET AND ANGRY BUT ALSO HAPPY FOR HIM BUT NO THEY RUINED MY OTP
@giffyleto SAME YUP GOODNIGHT ILY
@giffyleto <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>

@ShakefieldCasey but if they're taking photos of his house or inside his house, he can sue. there's privacy laws. <GRIMACING FACE>
@ShakefieldCasey just be glad that those photos aren't actually legally allowed to be sold
but nothing is set in stone and we have no obligations. i just want to make that little girl i used to be, proud of the woman she became.
i've been many labels in my lifetime but first and foremost i am a human being. its part of our DNA to mess up sometimes, to make mistakes.
we all have pasts, we all have stories. some worth trophies, some we wish we could erase. but it's a choice to let them define you.
he served 10 years and came out and has been changing his life around ever since. just more proof that it's never too late to start again.

general rule: if somebody yells at your pet, throw them out of your house and delete their number.
you should always judge people on how they treat animals. from pets, to strays, to livestock, to wild animals. it's all important.

it really sucks when somebody just decides that they don't like you as a person when in reality you're actually really great. #yourloss

i love it when somebody thinks they're big shot and yet the paparazzi either don't know who they are or can't spell their name right
laughing because we just got a photo set at work of the vamps performing in glasgow and the photographer got brad and connor mixed up
the fact that brooklyn beckham was born in 1999 causes me a world of problems

i'm literally getting paid to edit photos of zayn malik today and holy shit his eyelashes are so long. dude has the most feminine eyes.
we just got about 30 photos at work of zayn malik getting mobbed at the asian awards. woah. fans need to calm down.
omfg zayn shaved his head
i'm getting really fucking sick of all these youtubers having books published
trust google maps to make me 20 minutes early for my bus at 6 o'clock in the morning. my struggle is so real.
lets all prayer circle that no celebrities do anything interesting today so that work is super quiet <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@rockyR5 don't care till uk dates are out soz not soz

the best thing about transferring your job to another country is that money becomes less of an issue
asking people to spend time with u who you haven't seen in months is weird. but it's different when you're leaving the country aye. <GRIMACING FACE>

@giffyleto being there for people (still talking bout me), you are good at not being judgemental or biased, you are good at love. etc. etc.
@giffyleto (mostly me) laugh and smile, you are good at werking that hair colour of yours, you are good at being a friend/genuinely just
@giffyleto you are good at calming people (me) down, you are good at seeing sunshine in the middle of storms, you are good at making people
@giffyleto you are good at being you. i wish you were so much closer so i could form a proper list, but i'll go off what i know
@giffyleto nope nope nope nope i will not accept that as a fact
@thecrystalgem already fawning over halsey but ooh the maine ok

@giffyleto don't drop anything
@giffyleto i shall let u know when i know
so many young people having babies these days and don't even realise they'll probably have to raise them in a broken home at some point.
i got a lot to say about those kids who think that they're gonna stay with their teenage sweetheart forever.
@kattparry @giffyleto pst.
so, it looks like im getting another week to sort my stuff out before i leave nz. which means maybe getting to see the script yay!
work is so busy today but i'm getting distracted by chris evans' face
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> yup. just got about 30 photos of chris evans at once <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
the avengers cast is so beautiful i can barely cope. even their wives/kids/families are gorgeous, it's just not fair.
@ratliffR5 happy birthday ya old git
not to mention, so many musicians and bands are getting too big for their boots and not promoting their stuff properly/efficiently.
the less records that sell, the less money artists get and so they increase their ticket prices instead. then you've got fans complaining.
so, the music industry is basically collapsing on itself. the more streaming services there are the less records get bought.

mum talking about how her ex boyfriend's wife looks like her. they dated like 40 years ago. mother pls.
@writingforart a singer of some sort, same manager as justin bieber i think
@BethAhkneeMan really? woah okay. i saw them last month and i was super impressed with ronnie! but fair enough.
@BethAhkneeMan they're really good live tho
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand lemme answer that for you real quick and say no. you have a twisted view of the value of life.
so when's @BrunoMars releasing new music then
@MaxGeorge omg
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand that's not the point, in fact it is irrelevant. it's not like hunting is a necessity. it's a sick game.
@brockashby eyelash game strong
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand would you say the same thing about a straight up murderer? (lemme take it back to the essence of this) i doubt it.
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand its about drawing the line. you'll happily shoot an innocent animal and say it's a cultural thing whatever but
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand idk about you but when a lion or shark is ripping you limb from limb, i wouldn't say that humans are superior.
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand neither of you are understanding any of this. it's not about who's 'intellectually superior'.
anybody know of any animal shelters/homes in london that take on casual volunteers?
@BeaverBand @ItisHayk that hayk person said animals &lt; humans. that choice. geez. this isn't difficult to understand guys.
i haven't weighed myself in years because i just don't care and its dangerous to get fixated on things like that. can we please stop?????
people told me at the wedding that i appear to have lost weight and i was like like "uh ok thanks ?????"
@_michaelajayne do they live in or near london tho?
@BeaverBand @ItisHayk i asked why it was a choice, as to why does one have to be better than the other.
@coupdemain @FlyAirNZ woah. thank you. good excuse to get the fam over. <GRIMACING FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@coupdemain @FlyAirNZ excuse me?!
cheese and pineapple toasties in thames are probably the closest i've gotten to heaven
when somebody offers to let you stay at their house in henley-on-thames 
so i hate flying with a burning and queasy passion but i cannot tell you how excited i am to spend 24+ hours watching films on the planes.
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand that makes no sense but i am beyond disappointed in you and your values.
gotta say, i'm a bit bummed that i don't get to go to hawaii with my mother the week after next. <CRYING FACE>
PSA: 
@aimeecoffee uGH <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@ItisHayk @BeaverBand why is it a choice?
okay so i got a four hour bus ride now and i need you guys to keep me company/entertained

@TheVampsTristan just decided that i'm not gonna buy the next album then
@BeaverBand @rickygervais would you say the same about murderers tho?
but are we gonna talk about how, judging by drake's reaction, the man just got sexually assaulted on stage?
uh but real quick: why did madonna kiss drake? why is that a thing that happened?
goodnight

@Michael5SOS why the fuck have you spent mum like mom surely you're not that uneducated
being back in tauranga reminds me why i used to drink so much. or maybe it's just because bloodstream is playing over the speakers.
i can't believe my dad is getting married tomorrow
so much pampering going into wedding prep and i am LOVING it. #onlydaughterperks
otp tho 
it's always funny coming back to tauranga and getting back into the beach town vibes. the jandals have made their return.
you can tell a lot about somebody by which character from 'that 70s show' they fancied. (hyde)

@giffyleto oooooh okay thanks
@giffyleto yaaaaas gurl
@bigtimekiwi definitely. and you'd get to work for better people <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
random question but does anybody know of anywhere in nz that does cheap special event makeup? like, does farmers?
@bigtimekiwi aw you're welcome haha. not that i did much. but hey first step is figuring out what u wanna do and you've got that down!
@bigtimekiwi well fair enough, it'd probably be cheaper there anyway. but boo, that sucks. little steps though, you'll get there <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@bigtimekiwi see that sounds fun! i know that i definitely wish i'd gone to uni. time goes by so quickly.
@bigtimekiwi real talk tho, you'll regret it if you don't. you can always go on an exchange or something.
i feel like i've been punched in the face but in the best way possible. .....is that a thing?
@rikerR5 important question, what is your favourite pirates of the caribbean film?
my second cousins are so good looking wtf (second and fourth from left) 
when something super exciting yet absolutely terrifying happens and you wanna tell everybody but you can't
i have friendship crushes on so many people
today really cannot end soon enough. i am so keen for this five day weekend.
@Betty_Blue_x uhhhh jon snow
i understand that this is a well known fact, but geez kit harrington is beautiful <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
fact: my favourite person to get photos of at work is dustin hoffman because he always plays hide and seek with the paparazzi.
i love that ed sheeran is just like 'i don't need any more money or fame so i'm just gonna do things that look fun.'
@Isxbelleee then do it?
@Isxbelleee perks man, perks
@Isxbelleee at least u don't live at the bottom of the world

@frontiertouring hey can i exchange u my soul/organs/a bunch of hugs/anything/everything for a m&amp;g with the script in auckland?
@Georgina_Dolan hey, your new twitter photo is flawwwwless. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
i'm just gonna chuck it out there but is there a dude exactly like nat wolff that i could cuddle on the reg bc i'd really like that
you know those kids who are like 'this band saved my life'? the closest i get to that is the script, circa 2010/11/12.
there's is literally nothing that would make me happier/more emotional/more appreciative than getting to meet the script. honestly.
it's always a nice evening when u get to leave work early because there's literally nothing to do
@edsheeran geez kiwis are the best
there's a fire behind somebody's eyes when they talk about their passions. best thing in the world and i would like it bottled up please.
the thing about entertainment journalism is that nothing sounds better than getting to sit in a room with somebody &amp; talk about their craft
@bigtimekiwi @stephaniehattan it literally takes two seconds to find ya
@_michaelajayne dammit mick if you'd told me i would've just gotten them <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

hey somebody be a darling and teach me how to surf and play the guitar please
@LauraticFanatic @rossR5 cheers dude
people will let u down and break ur heart but do u know what won't? puppies.
one of the problems with making plans with a 23 year old dude: they don't wake up till approximately 3pm.
(20 and 2/3 tomorrow if we wanna be exact) (i'm so close to 21 i could cry) (but i'm sitting in a public library so i won't)

@bigtimekiwi dude u have the best luck wtf
hey @BuzzFeedEnt can i have a job? let's be real, we're perfect for each other.
@_michaelajayne it'll depend what the starting fee is
@_michaelajayne its bc it was the entire family but honestly easter sunday appears to be the only day they ever go to church so ya go away
oh what i would give to do 18 all over again
just remind me why i didn't go to university because i don't even know anymore
so it costs $150,000 to attend UCLA for three years. frick. americans must be loaded.
oop and just like that i got another 90 photos of the kardashians in 5 minutes. that all need to be named. i've lost the will to live.
@_michaelajayne probably up to about 400 photos spread over two different clients by now. never despised that family more.
all we've gotten today are photos of the kardashians going to church and i'm about to tear my hair out, leave and never come back
@ZMonline wait @bigtimekiwi ????!!!!
because then we're just telling young girls that they should have completely unrealistic 'body goals' and an unhealthy body image. justsayin
also can we please stop idolising the bodies of women like the kardashians that have been surgically changed and photoshopped
i just want to know who told kylie jenner that she should get lip injections because nobody, Iet alone a 17 year old, should be told that
@kieranlemon no
the 27 club is so real and we sweep it under the rug when in reality it should have been a wake up call a long time ago.
it's sad to think that even when 'fame' drives people towards addiction and tragic deaths, we're still treating celebrities like property.
tryna get 5 days off work for my dads wedding because i'm a terrible person woops soz not soz
does anybody know what the best kind of travel camera is that isn't a $500 go pro?
this quote changed my life 
is this what it's like to be a mother 
@_michaelajayne lemme dm u some wisdom
@_michaelajayne oop i just saw the loan tweet but its alright dude, yolo
@_michaelajayne ok what's wrong dude
we literally get spammed with DWTS photos every day at work and the girls are making fun of me for caring. welcome to tabloid media <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
everything about this photo got me like <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #thosecurlstho 
kids say that they'd rather be exploring than sitting still but when it comes down to it they seek comfort in security and playing it safe
all i really want in life right now is somebody who is willing to sacrifice everything to come travel the world with me
also i remember the words to every backstreet boys song is that the type of thing i put on my CV
backstreet doco got me so emotional but also remembering why nick carter was one of my first childhood crushes
there's kind of nothing better than watching somebody achieve their wildest dreams
~pretends like i'm not purposely claiming all the photos of riker lynch at work~
quiet days at work yAAAAAAAAS 
times like these i wish we had emigrated to canada instead of new zealand

PSA: tragus piercings are absolutely pointless and stupid and i recommend you never get one
nah mate, thats bullshit. its never been easier to create ur own dream life. if bands can go from garages to stadiums, you can do anything <VICTORY HAND>
as young kids we get told to follow our passions yet somewhere along the way, 'being realistic' becomes more important.
if there is something that you feel as though you were born to do, then you need to do that. whether as a hobbie or as your career.
i feel like if there's something that you'd be willing to give up everything for; people, places, possessions; thats the thing you should do
it's been disgustingly hot for so long i'm actually forgetting what winter feels like. #kiwiproblems
