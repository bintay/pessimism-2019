History books teach that slavery ended in 1864 but Hawaiians were enslaved on sugar plantations until 1900.
@highkeychildish a couple of months ago! You didn't hear about it? I'll try to find you a link if you want it
History books teach that native Hawaiians WANTED their own queen held at gunpoint and forced to sign over her people's land.
@highkeychildish remember when Oklahoma senators wanted rewrite history books because they thought the modern books made them look bad
@_bentleys thought the exact same thing when I watched it lmao
Telling me to go back to my country when I'm Hawaiian Mexican is the most ignorant shit you could ever tell me.
@highkeychildish whites love to point out that we jumped a border to get here but they crossed an entire ocean to get here but ok Mary Beth

White ppl gotta stick their pasty asses into every god damn thing POC have. It's fucking annoying.
But then be like "don't support the protestors in Baltimore! Violence solves nothing&lt;3 attacking the govt won't get you anywhere(:"
White ppl will find any excuse to drink even if that means celebrating OUR win over French colonization in Mexico..
White people celebrating our culture today but yet they don't give a fuck about half the shit going on in Mexico right now lmao

@KaylayRene but I understand, obviously  property in Baltimore matters more than innocent lives being taken.
@KaylayRene yes but these cops killing black people IS about race. Did you not read what I first wrote when I called you out? Or?
@KaylayRene you know what else isn't helping anyone? Unarmed black people being killed every 8 hours by police. Miss me with this shit.
@KaylayRene or do you only support violence when it's not going against white people? Hmm?
@KaylayRene and if you genuinely think that violence isn't going to solve this, I bet you don't support our troops as well right?
@KaylayRene excuse me who are you to say how and why POC should be protesting ? Lmao
White girls wanna open their mouth about Baltimore but when you call them out they're no where to be found? Okay Mary Beth
@KaylayRene or are you just talking out of your ass?
@KaylayRene also have you watched any of the videos or have been following the events of Baltimore?
These protests against police that you are talking about isnt just about the police. Its about systematic oppression 
This video is literally called Hot Girl with Ballsack.. Yall senses of humor is ugly. This is disgusting.  
My life 
Why do police officers have jobs if they resort to excessive force in every god damn situation?
Police officers don't even give a fuck anymore if they're being video taped or not...
They need that many officers on an unarmed protestors? They need to resort to tearing him down and dragging him by his locs?
River Monsters is such a good show omg
And he deleted it. Figures.
You sing like an angel but are actual piece of dog doodoo melting in the summer sun fuck you @TylerCarter4L 
Mayweather is the definition of hyper masculinity
You can beat your wife and threaten to kill your children but as long as you make enough money to flaunt your success UR respected... Ok

@blyth33s @nellvergara I hate you lmao
@blushing_vivian white girls soak in the sun and get skin cancer just so they could have our natural melanin so now I rly don't care
I honestly love being a brown girl.
@blushing_vivian it was really sad. I remember vividly that  all I wanted in middle school was to be white.
I also remember wearing foundation lighter than my skin color so i could look whiter. I was 11 during all of this.
I remember I wanted to dye my hair blue but I thought that brown girls don't look pretty w colored hair bc of the negative connotations
I remember asking my mom if it were possible if I could bleach my skin bc I was SO ashamed of my skin color
I remember when when I first moved to Cali I would stay out of the sun so I could be white bc I thought it would make me look prettier
Hawai'i made me so brown like I think this summer my melanin finally gonna be poppin
Why do I look that white tho
Korbel playing Max in The Sound of Music was just Korbel playing Korbel

We aren't born some politically correct intersectional feminist that's educated about their able bodied cis gender privilege
We are not born some radical thinkers but that should never be an excuse to remain ignorant when there are ppl always trying to educate.
I was 15 and I was a child. There was a point where I wanted to learn and expand my knowledge.
I used to believe that it was a good thing to be color blind because that obviously fixes the problem of racism right?
I used to believe that if you wanted to live in the US you should speak English even though I learned Spanish just to understand mi abuelito
I used to believe that POC could be racist towards white peoples because being called a cracker is the same as being called the n word.
I used to believe that if girls wore revealing clothing and got drunk at a party that that somehow justified them being sexually abused.
I remember always asking "if girls wanted to be a lesbian, why do they date girls that look like boys?"
I used to believe non black people could wear dreads and be perfectly fine. I still remember the day I matted my hair and put some in.
I used to say the n word and think nothing of it. I used it light heartily so I obviously wasn't hurting anyone right?
@casssm_ I love you too!!
I live for @pearliaison's sass

And then make it look effortless and graceful like damn I have to much respect for pole dancers and any type of sex worker really
How is pole dancing not considered a sport like... The physical capability you must have to hold up UR entire body on a POLE
This is beautiful  
Also if you put down boys wearing makeup fuck you no one likes you
Fuck anyone who puts you down because you feel more comfortable in your skin with makeup on than being all natural.
Obama was born in the Queen's Hospital in Honolulu... Why are Ya'll reaching this fucking hard

@romaliciouss it's alright I still see Tara 9/10 times im in there
Children in Hawai'i aren't given the same educational opportunities as the rest of the country and Hawaiian culture is rarely being taught.
More and more developments are being made to Hawai'i which make pride in one's land very difficult to attain especially as a child.
Hawaiians support #WeAreMaunaKea so that the keiki (kids) can still have some sort of pride left over for their land.
The most heartbreaking thing to experience is to literally see your culture and land die in front of your eyes.
Although white people aren't the majority of the islands population, they currently hold the highest median income.
58% of the people living in Hawai'i are if Asian decent, 39.3% are Caucasian and only 23.3% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
There are less than 7,000 pure blood Hawaiians left.
Before Captain Cook landed in the Hawaiian islands, there were 400,000-500,000 kanaka māoli. A century later, there were only 8,000-9,000.
Friendly reminder that slavery did not end in America in 1865. Slavery was abolished in Hawai'i in 1900.

If not for PROTESTS and leaders ON THE GROUND in Baltimore, these officers WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED.

PROTESTS…

@SLAYBBYGRL @BrianasNicoles I have seriously been spelling this out for white people for MONTHS and they still don't get the idea
Blake people are not out to get white people. Black people are out here because white people are out to get black people.
MY FUCKIN HITTA !!! 
@ULTRVWAVY EW I saw that tweet when they were complaining about prom being canceled.. Like sorry a black man got his spinal chord severed
This is why I love Magie 
@ULTRVWAVY Why do I have to literally tell people that a black life matters more than a window.
@ULTRVWAVY shit makes me mad. Why am I defending something is just a given?
@magiiiiie YES OK I KNOW WHAT VID UR TALKING ABOUT
@magiiiiie Yes ? Kinda made me mad
Stop using shitty ass arguments to cover up the fact that you are a racist.
Remember when cities across the nation did non violent Hands Up Don't Shoot protests and they were still called thugs
Remember when there were peaceful protests in St. Louis and Ferguson and ya'll still found a way to tarnish their efforts?
Stop saying "if you want to be respected act dignified" you know damn well you guys still gonna see blacks as a nuisance either way
MLK protested peacefully and still got assassinated by the govt. Did ya'll forget that?
@nicolecocuy this is a damn shame ..
@magiiiiie  
His life wasn't even given a chance to thrive.
I shouldn't even have to make that argument because PROPERTY is not greater than a LIFE.
Freddie Grey's life was not insured. His life cannot be given back, rebuilt and given a chance to thrive again.
Their insurance covers cost to rebuild their business and pay to replace their damaged merchandise.
Do people understand that many of the businesses that were looted have insurance on their property and facility?
@TheOnlyMarshall that's what's matters.
@TheOnlyMarshall exactly. There wasn't even media attention when peaceful protests going on. They're getting their voices heard now.

@HerreraJuann yes like that's nice you do that but when you throw your racist two cents into something as big as Baltimore U become shit
"thugs must be stopped" yeah they getting offed every 28 hours don't worry 
@HerreraJuann feel the same. I don't like white people unless they show me a reason to like them.
You're right they started pepper spraying high school students and shooting them with rubber bullets + tear gas 
@HerreraJuann @realDonaldTrump YES. Just because you called a black person an "African American" doesn't make you not racist ..
@HerreraJuann @realDonaldTrump he said "our great African American president" in the most condescending tone ever.. This is gross?

This the same type of shit as Israel and Gaza. You can only instigate for so long until the oppressed finally fights back
"We should be fighting back nonviolently" okay let's just have high schoolers be pepper sprayed by police and shot at by rubber bullets.
You wanna act hood, wanna act like your black, act like you really from the streets. Where the fuck you at now
Get the fuck outta here. You bitches need to buss open that fuckin history book and get to reading

@craigslistpimp black man in Baltimore got his spinal cord severed, breathing pipe crushed and died by getting tackled by police
@craigslistpimp the daily us twitter has all the updates if you're behind too!
@craigslistpimp and they closed down public transportation for schools so kids got in the middle of the riots
@craigslistpimp looting and riots are still breaking out in Baltimore bc of Freddie Grey. State of emergency enacted basically
I try to open minded about things but how many black men and women have to be killed by police in order for you to see what's wrong.
I really, really have no place in my heart for people who don't care and/or support police in times likes these in Baltimore.

I was really disturbed at the video of Walter Scott and I'm even more disturbed that police managed to snap Freddie Gray's spinal cord.
@PoCBeauty do you think it will be okay to use on super sensitive skin? I wanna try it so bad!
White ppl think it's okay to riot when the Giants win the World Series but it's complete insanity when ppl riot for dead black men ???

Why don't I look like this im so confused ? 
@nnacrz social justice warriors
@nnacrz and they totally have a point. I did that shit I'm no excuse!
@nnacrz yes it's really hard! But I've heard so many ppl criticize SJW by saying they're too aggressive and not really educating anyone
You have so many types of resources that can use instead of blabbering on and on about something you have no idea about.
However just bc you arent educated on a subject does not give you an excuse to say whatever racist, homophobic, transphobic things you want.
I would rather educate a person and still have them disagree with me than to attack them and still have them disagree.
People will not listen if they feel like they are threatened. No matter how mad I get, I'm going to try to remember this.
Verbally attacking people is actually really reductive when you want change their opinion.
One thing Ive been workin on is trying to be calm when addressing certain ppl who disagree or who are genuinely not educated on the subject.
@ih8vegans girl... You're the bombest !!

@korbelyo @Ny_Eellah i liked Trixie a lot ! I think she was underestimated and she was cute. But Max is more talented than her overall
@raybunnnny OUR FAV LIL KID

"Yeah. Fine." 
@korbelyo @Ny_Eellah okay bye??? Why don't you like her
Violet is an aerial dancer and doing all of this whole tucking her penis in between her legs. This bitch <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
I'm ashamed to say that I ever doubted @VioletChachki because bitch I'm absolutely living for you
@Ny_Eellah yeah honestly I'd want back Max too. She had like top three potential. Easily. She was robbed.
@Ny_Eellah seriously I don't even know if I want Trixie or Max to come back it's hard but I'm pretty sure it'll be Trixie <SLEEPY FACE>
@Ny_Eellah they were my top three!! Max seriously had so much potential and creativity. Like my jaw dropped when she got eliminated ...
@Crappy why lmao

@Ny_Eellah than just 77 cents.
@Ny_Eellah it makes me so mad! Like yes. It's nice to see more and more ppl become aware of this issue, but it's a lot more complicated
White fem only cares about the 77 cents a white women makes to a man's dollar. They don't care about the 64 cents a Hawaiian woman makes.
@Ny_Eellah im mistaken. I got the Latina and Native Hawaiian pay difference mixed up. They should be swapped. My bad <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Ny_Eellah 
Dreamin of you as my lover, flyin like a streamer thinking of new ways to do each other,
Get ya mouth open, you're high
It's FKA twigs get with it U hag
Why did someone really snap me asking what song was playing in my story ?
I watched you in that a apartment somewhere from across the room it's all a haze, I remember vaguely lit lights and staring there to you
Some days I watch and you don't care.
And I watched your reversal, it's an honest thing when there's no one there. Some days they feel like dress rehearsals.
Let me in, give me the holy privileges
Only a damn fool stress over someone that ain't stressin them
@korbelyo Bitch thanks for fucking spoiling it goodbye
I can only try so much. At the end of the day, if I'm not worth it, then I'm not worth it. Mai hopohopo

As an "ally" you need to know and understand what spaces are yours and where you can tread. Be knowledgable. That's all we ask.
Mauna Kea, along with the rest of Hawai'i, is our 'āina. Just bc Ya grandfathers led our land into be bombed 70yrs ago doesn't make it yours
Kanaka māoli have, and always will, fight for their land. Don't forget that you are still our oppressor. You will never be Mauna Kea.
It's not that I don't appreciate people out there fighting for the greater good, it's just that there are other phrases they can be using.
Just because we are fighting for the same cause does not make you an equal. You are not kama'aina. This ain't Ya land
Haoles protesting at Mauna Kea have no right to be using the pronoun "we".

When it comes to skin care... Pay top dollar baby. You get what you pay for.
I was soooo afraid to start using retain-a bc of the peeling but now that I have taken three years to perfect my regimen I feel so good
You know your skin care routine is bomb when 9/10 users of retain-a get peeling within the first 1-2 weeks but Ya face is smooth as a baby

@YTM1staWu1fy are you a person of color?
@YTM1staWu1fy a person.
@YTM1staWu1fy I am looked at as a person before my color is taken into consideration. Being a colored person means I am different before I'm
@YTM1staWu1fy why would I be? I am a person. I am brown. I am a person of color. Not a colored person. That phrase is offensive.
@FemSpa I never invalidated them. You're just reaching for an argument now.
I have never felt dehumanized by someone calling me POC? I have never met a POC who felt offended by this? 
Can white people stop throwing their two cents into #BrownAndProud? Take Ya sorry asses somewhere else this is our day.
@YTM1staWu1fy you act as if we can't reclaim slurs ...
When you ain't have shit to say back so your throw some irrelevant ass fact you got from did-you-know 
@FemSpa @amyyponce @puppyqueeen @merlinspants07 all we did was call you out for being a "feminist" bc you don't care about WoC..
@puppyqueeen @FemSpa @amyyponce @merlinspants07 LMAOOOOOO
@puppyqueeen @FemSpa @merlinspants07 @amyyponce meant the last tweet at FemSpa lol
@puppyqueeen @FemSpa @merlinspants07 @amyyponce I bet you don't care about trans girls or disabled girls ????
@FemSpa @puppyqueeen @merlinspants07 @amyyponce my feminism is intersectional.
@puppyqueeen @FemSpa @merlinspants07 @amyyponce yup.. ppl's feminism doesn't mean anything if they only stand for white women.
@otrabruises you're welcome!! I love you too! <GROWING HEART>
