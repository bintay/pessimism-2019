So looking like a fat version of Citizen Cope is "in" this year

#TheKing @KingJames #ChasingChampionships 
@TMadCLE great insight and great shirts!  Thank you Tony! #BELIEVELAND
Chicago is just as bad as boston.  Dont have enough talent so they use "physical" play. Haaa we got LEBRON!  
@carpenter_usmc  
@CavsFredMcLeod your reaction was the best one!! GO CAVS!!!
What up chicago? 
Good Morning Cleveland! 
@carpenter_usmc  
Can we all say @joeharrisuva is the luckiest white kid ever!!!
@mozg25 fits so damn well in Cleveland!   Big game today! #BELIEVELAND <POUTING FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><GRIMACING FACE> #GOCAVS

@Faded_Off_Life 
@bklynplayboy 
@sticcmonsta 
ZERO DEBATE.  LEBRON JAMES IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME
POETIC JUSTICE
Foul on Noah.  Like its simple.  Wtf @nba why do the refs pick and choose what they call?!
Need a Mozgov shersey!
@Hugginston solid lol
@WOIOSports Ky needs to be spot up shooter let bron and whoever else drive more and get Ky going from 3!   Opens up everything
@CJ12_ im not even a buckeye fan but Cardale Jones is the fucking man! #TheLand
@WilliamDRiley can you do me a favor Bill and start a U S A! chant?  Btw I chizzed in my shorts just now
The general public RUIN every single holiday.  The most rude disrespectful people shop on a holiday.
Pretty fuckin awful.  Chicago has no clue how lucky they are 
If I had to pick another favorite team in the NBA its always gonna be Memphis.  Z BO does not age and hes going off on g state!
Realized we were getting worked by phil fucking hughes.  Jesus 
Swisher with the bruce jenner haircut.  Describes our whole team perfectly: Vaginas
Man its official.  NFL Pro Football is DEAD to me!  DEAD!  Thanks for ruining everything about pro football @nflcommish
@JIBRALTER haha ok?  series is never over when we have the real #23 
@JIBRALTER 
@NBA @SportsCenter 
*avoids the internet for a while*
Oh cool the bank is open late in chicago
@troylinzy wishful thinking lol but I'll root em on all the way no matter what
@troylinzy seems like every game I start to watch they are already down lol.  Im hopeful but not very optimistic on this season
@troylinzy I mean guys have hit for us but we give up any runs we get as soon as our pitchers get on the mound. That stands out more
@troylinzy goes both ways though.  The shitty pitching stands out big time
Joakim Noahs stats this series speak for itself.  OVERRATED!  And hes a major wanna be thug
@troylinzy what are those pitchers doing now?  Losing.  Kluber at a record pace
@troylinzy @NickSwisher #FIREMICKEYCALLAWAY
All time playoff series records mean absolutely nothing @SportsCenter
@CoachJim4UM mistaking UM players for mich st players on @SportsCenter    MUST FIX THIS COACH!
@SportsCenter these guys on your network have been there so long they get burnt out and bitter.  Its terrible tv
@SportsCenter you guys shuffle women reporters like crazy but yet you hold onto the angry biased men reporters who keep fans away
@SmokedoggStotz @troylinzy @RayRayC3 @zach_thompson25 #GayRoomieTime

Beautiful evening to #BeatTheBulls  #GOCAVS
Ok @CutonDime25 he got rid of the good black players but signed Demarco Murry, okay?  Quit with the race card its an ugly look cheif
Fuck I hate the bulls
Smoko de mayo got the best of me last night!
Salazar is so money and he doesnt even know it.  Hes very close to getting to that next level of consistency
What disappoints me most is that Love and Smith not being here was preventable.  Cavs will need an all world game from LBJ and Ky weds
@JoakimNoah fuck chicago! 
I see you @NickSwisher up at the costco <EYES>
ESPN is fucking awful.
Had way too much fun yeterday <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
If u thnk about it life is a bonfire

Id have a massive stroke if the @indians ever spent 100mil+ on one player in my lifetime
The @indians needed a legit right handed RBI hitter, and a retractable roof.  Instead we got brandon moss and a new bar.  Seems reasonable
But we have a new bar in right field @indians
This outside the lines with jim harbaugh and jameis winston is fucking priceless.  Its total opposites talking about crab legs and bb guns
Lol the @indians look EXTREMELY relieved to of won this one. #ROLLTRIBE #TIMALLEN #CHICKENAL

@Dan_Shaughnessy last friend who visited beantown was robbed at gun point.
@Dan_Shaughnessy the indians sold out 455 straight because the browns were out of town.  Fenway is a cat piss stained shithole
@Dan_Shaughnessy i got half way thru your piece and stopped reading.  It sounds like my 7th grade report on a cavs game I went to

@TStreet1982 @ThatDetroitFan ive been everywhere in michigan.  Literally everywhere.  The nicest parts are farrrr from detroit
@TStreet1982 @ThatDetroitFan ohhh man lmao.  I bet you're gonna tell me about eminem next?  Detroit is in ruins.  My city is not!
Gotta love the over zealous baseball fan who touts ridiculous stats from the 1st week of a 162 game season!
@TStreet1982 @ThatDetroitFan hahahaha!  Even if that were 100% true, which it isnt, I wouldnt n proud of that statement.
@TStreet1982 @ThatDetroitFan yea Dan Gilbert's doing so well he came to Cleveland and bought an NBA team and built a casino.  Makes sense...
@Frye_Days4ever lmao.  Talk to me in september.  Winning the division means nothing.  Ask the royals lol

@Det_Tigers20 @ggbootsrock true story.  Has the gov't had to bail Cleveland out?  Nope!
@ggbootsrock with all that plight you detroit creatures have up there, u have to have something to cheer about!
@ggbootsrock more likely its the tiger fans who smell like shit and bankruptcy
If there is distinct smell of shit downtown Cleveland this afternoon, dont be alarmed.  The detroit tigers are in town.
@MorningClinkers if we took miggys fatass out you'd all be crying too.  Shut up.

If you didnt know that fausto carmona was an awful closer in 2006 and watched him blow 3 straight saves in boston.  Not a true #indians fan
Without google.  If u dont know who bill selby was then you arent a true #indians fan 
As brady quin would say..."now i'm done"
With that said I bleed red white and blue and will always love the tribe.  But I wont buy into what @indians FO tries to sell. #indians
All the @indians care about is food, cutting costs and twitter contests.  They arent truly in the business of winning titles
The SF giants are a great example of modern baseball that could be replicated elsewhere #indians
U gotta protect the young talent but u also have to PAY to have nice things i.e. Pitching!   #indians
The @indians have done a number n the younger fanbase.  Made to believe prospects r worth more than proven talent.  It goes both ways
We sign these young players who are good to extensions and yet they are club/trade friendly cause they could be gone in no time! #indians
Besides the cavs.  Cle teams covet and protect prospects WAYYY TOO MUCH.  the good teams make moves and spend $.  Gotta try something new
@CleSportsProbs_ dont question any tribe stuff, this moron will go outta his way to be keyboard killa!   What a joke.
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc that other guy doesnt deserve to call us out lol.  Me and carp bleed cle man.  Tito is a big x factor. Love him
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ obviously.  Im saying the indians say that every year to wait and still no rings.  Moneyball?
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ would love to talk more.  Beers and baseball talk anytime.  Me n car we'll b at opening day
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ me and carp love the indians always have.  But we need tp#o try new stuff.  No rings!!
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ u said y question an org. When nothing to talk about.  U can ? Whatever u want.  Its legal
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ if u dont win the last game of the season nobody gives a shit.
@CleSportsProbs_ @carpenter_usmc @Brantleypls thas ur opinion and we are all entitled to it
@PeteHorner13 wheres the world series ring??   They been sellin this shit for years and years still no title
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ everyone questions the gov't and nobody seems to make as big of a de as u 2
@carpenter_usmc @Brantleypls @CleSportsProbs_ its ok to question the team u love.  But dont believe u know it all cuz u look like a douche
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ whod we get for lee???   Lou marson anyone??
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ he was a player to be named.  I remember matt laporta
@Brantleypls @carpenter_usmc @CleSportsProbs_ how can u assume CC didnt wanna stay?   Do u know him personally?
@Brantleypls @CleSportsProbs_ @carpenter_usmc sounds to me like u children arent man enough to have an intelligent baseball talk.
@CleSportsProbs_ @Brantleypls me and @carpenter_usmc would love to sit down, have a beer and talk sports with u guys
@CleSportsProbs_ @Brantleypls the real prob is u guys probly got trophies for last place and were told you were special.
@CleSportsProbs_ @Brantleypls how old are you two?   That would answer alot of your blind optimism with sports.
@CleSportsProbs_ @Brantleypls look at my tweets.   I said the a's are competitive because they dont keep selling prospects to its fans
@CleSportsProbs_ they compete every year by keeping a talented roster.  Billy beane never comes out and tells us hes rebuilding
@CleSportsProbs_ ur defense mechanisms and know it all attitude wont get u very far.
@PeteHorner13 a team that truthfully wants to win a world series and not just cut costs and sell "prospects" to its fans would keep pitching
@Brantleypls @CleSportsProbs_ i cant have a problem with the team I love?
@CleSportsProbs_ yea those swisher and bourn deals really helped tho bro.  Ur an idiot man.  Delusional at its best.  Have a good day
@PeteHorner13 @Browns @Indians we will be "rebuilding" again in a year and they will trade him for prospects i.e. Sabathia/lee
@CleSportsProbs_ Everyone knows that.  Im not saying we can keep everyone but if u truly wanna win the WS u MUST pay big 4 pitching
@CleSportsProbs_ obviously.  We all know that already.  But then how r the a's doing it year in year out?   Again The FO has brainwashed u
@CleSportsProbs_ and they win consistently.  And have world series titles to show for.
@CleSportsProbs_ wtf are these fans that our obsessed with racking up prospects and draft picks.  Do the yanks/redsox/angels do that?  No!
@CleSportsProbs_ its the good teams that get them and pay them cause they r in the business of winning world series. Thats not the @indians
@CleSportsProbs_ just because hes under control for til 18' means ZERO!   Lots of great players get traded with years of control left
@CleSportsProbs_ the teams that arent into REALLY winning a world series trade players like that then tell the fans we r rebuilding again
@CleSportsProbs_ how in the hell do u do that after bein a game from the world series?   U've been brain washed by the dolans man lol
@CleSportsProbs_ my prob isnt with the players its the front office and owner.  They cont. to brainwash the fanbase year after year
@CleSportsProbs_ we traded CC a year after going 7 games in the ALCS and cliff lee having a cy young year.  Do u know what rebuilding is?
@CleSportsProbs_ u dont have to bother bro
@CleSportsProbs_ whatever helps you sleep at night.  I dont think you've been a cle fan long enough.  Give it a few more years.
@CleSportsProbs_ says the delusional person with "wiggins is coming back" lol.  Gimme a break.
@EKAllen2 what did kipnis hit last year?   1 year of success isnt exactly real talent.
@EKAllen2 @CleSportsProbs_ you're an idiot.  I only mentioned Kluber.  So we will trade him next season 4 prospects.  Not exactly long term
@CleSportsProbs_ so we can trade him NEXT season's trade deadline for prospects?  Sweet deal man.
1 year deal for kluber.  Just like the @browns the @Indians refuse to sign REAL talent long term especially after semi-successful seasons!

@jdonnelly32885 @WFNYScott dont think alot teams know how to develop players.  I guess we keep waiting for that cant miss luck or manning <WEARY FACE>
@jdonnelly32885 @WFNYScott all starts with the QB. Much like a superstar in the nba will always attract FA's whether owners r racist or nuts
@jdonnelly32885 @WFNYScott im just saying, the browns and colts we thru instability but having a franchise QB makes it all possible, I agree
@jdonnelly32885 @WFNYScott colts owner is crazy, the coach had cancer missed most of a season.  Arians, a great OC leaves.  Seems stable?
@carpenter_usmc #okay
You think amber be like, wtf they keep alertin me for?
I see grass.

@jdonnelly32885 I guess a we want is for them to make smarter FA moves so we can keep bitching, but much less
@jdonnelly32885 but we also look at other teams who do spend and succeed.  Broncos were perennial 7-10 win team then BOOM they sign manning
@carpenter_usmc us fans should boycott @browns games and tailgates next season.  They give us 0 positive results, year after year!

@RayRayC3 its fucking awesome man.  Im positive Jim Harbaugh does not sleep at all.  His twitter is excellent, and UM hockey hasnt lost...
@sweetnlow21 any of the countless articles and tweets saying why Would Harbaugh want to leave the NFL for college b4 he accepted UM job

If Urban wins tonight, you can bet your sweet ass the bears, jets, raiders and niners will be leaving voicemails on Urbans phone
