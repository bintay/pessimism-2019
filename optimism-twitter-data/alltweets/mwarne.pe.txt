@JackfromNewham @StopCityAirport It was suggested to me by a councillor that Wales realised it was mistake as soon as the votes were counted
@Khyberman That's not true either. Total BBC share of TV viewing is about 32%. 
@Khyberman Not true. BBC annual revenue = £3.7bn; Sky annual revenue = £7.6bn.
Me “It’s like a web designer, but more expensive and with less to show/“
Mom “Oh, like your …
@JackfromNewham @StopCityAirport If SRW decides to run again they'll probably choose not to give themselves a choice.
@Khyberman Thought you'd approve. Small business owner deciding who they serve and on what terms. Essence of the free market!
Does @UKLabour want to be power for its own sake, or to do things it genuinely believes in? My sense at the moment is the former.
Do you want to offer policies people will vote for, or persuade people the policies you have are ones worth voting for?
Not sure @Ed_Miliband did @UKLabour any favours by resigning so quickly. Party will now focus on itself, rather than opposing Tory govt.
/ @JackfromNewham A question that needs to be addressed by Sir Robin about his entire administration #Newham #JobsForTheBoys
Before embarking on his mission to destroy the Human Rights Act Michael Gove should read this: 
@E7Drew @iainaitch Wonder if UKIP Thanet council's failings will get as much attention as Green Brighton did?
@timrollpickerin @rectripp @SparrowhawkSo Who might go on to suffer the fate of deputy PM Clegg, having had his lack of principles exposed.
@rectripp @timrollpickerin @SparrowhawkSo And this is ultimately the point!
@SparrowhawkSo @rectripp Take away the 'vote x, get y' scaremongering nonsense &amp; tactical voting, things might look different.
@SparrowhawkSo @rectripp Not necessarily. People might very well vote differently in a system that reflects what they actually want.
@paultodonnell @Rachel_shares You could add London: Labour. But we get what southern rural England wants.
@tomdaviesE17 @shattenstone It's the Free Courts you should worry about.
@hrtbps Seat he campaigned for the Tories in, Enfield North, was a Labour gain.
Will Tory plans to scrap Human Rights Act &amp; replace it with 'British Bill of Rights' be run from MoJ, Gove's new department? We're fucked.
@miss_mcinerney Free Courts?
@jamogram That's their new social housing provision.
Michael Gove as Justice Secretary - exciting plans to create new independent Free Courts?
@britainelects @MikeGapes Given the recent record of pollsters I'm not taking any comfort from this!
@MPSNewham Thank you. Email sent, with photos attached.
Ha! There's a new book out called 'Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?' 
@MPSNewham How about seizing a car that's on the road untaxed? Reported to DVLA (twice), council &amp; local PC but no action.
@Khyberman Judging by the pictures on Twitter they're SWP.
@atticrahman @StopCityAirport No, I'm sorry to disappoint you. No tail or horns here. Not sure about the GSOH either.
@Khyberman Said they were a Labour activist? In those words?
@Khyberman What makes you think they have anything to do with the Labour Party or are within their control?
@atticrahman @StopCityAirport Reading the job spec you seem eminently well-qualified. Already being a Tory is a bonus.
@LawMike Surely either Lyn Brown or Stephen Timms could be persuaded to stand down to allow him to enter parliament &amp; assume his destiny?
@Trunker159 I don't know for certain that is the case, but it seems the most likely explanation.
@Trunker159 If the councillor lives at home with her parent(s) she lives 'somewhere' and has completed the register properly.
@timrollpickerin Its behaviour during the election campaign suggests otherwise.
@timrollpickerin But those were the words the Telegraph used in their story! (actually they said for decades, but same thing)
@Margin4Error I'm betting to rejoins the Tories before too long.
Tories will deliver their version of #electoralreform - redrawing parliamentary boundaries to lock @UKLabour out for a generation.
Another failed #Newham mayoral candidate standing in #GE2015: @aalancraig got 2024 votes for #UKIP in Brent North. Lost his deposit.
@DerkHat And in Newham one of them is lead by an utter cock.
When we talk about ‘the 3 big Westminster parties’ we now mean Tories, Labour &amp; SNP. No-one else even in double figures of MPs.
Osborne takes over Hague’s meaningless honorific of First Secretary of State. Before that Peter Mandleson had it.
@NewhamGreens @CharleneMcLean_Though he was at the Beckton count last year. Three sheets to the wind, judging by the photos!
@NewhamGreens @CharleneMcLean_ Why would he show up when it’s not ALL ABOUT HIM? Doesn’t want to share the limelight.
@iamscottbanks Election’s barely over &amp; Blairites looking to make Labour even less of an alternative to the Tories. Grrr!
Anyone associated with #BlueLabour should be told to fuck right off.
No, not our Stratford - the other one!
@grayee Starting with Labour group on Monday. I expect a couple of things might come up.
@60Sparkle Resigning as party leaders, not as MPs (at least not yet)
@MichaelWhite Agree. Take the summer off and see how the land lies in the Autumn.
@Marshajane Ashcroft was talking about it this morning. They want to cement a permanent majority. #gerrymandering
.@CharleneMcLean_ now has the highest personal vote of any #Newham councillor. I wonder if she’ll mention that when she next sees Sir Robin?
I’ve added a few comments on the election results in #Newham on my blog, if you’re at all interested: 
So a PM in the debt of Rupert Murdoch &amp; hostage to his own right-wing gets to decide the future of the BBC. Charter renewal in 2016. FFS.
@juliannemarriot A decent leader given an undeserved 5-year kicking by the press. In the end, a 6-week campaign not enough to overcome that.
@martinedobor @UKLabour Need to find a distinctive vision &amp; mission. Just sticking a smiley face on Tory austerity policies isn’t enough.
One thing Clegg is right about is the threat of the politics of fear and liberalism not faring well against it. An important fight to win.
@LegacyLies Yes, but a very, very distant third.
Clegg also talks about the importance of sticking to the party’s liberal values. Shame they didn’t over the 5 years in coalition.
Clegg thinks history will judge him and his place in the coalition kindly. He’s wrong. Very, very wrong.
New blog post: Election results from #Newham - no commentary, just the numbers 
@Rachel_shares @forzagaribaldi @NewhamGreens I very much hope so.
@LordAshcroft @electoralreform More of a priority than reducing MPs to 600 &amp; boundary changes. But Cam will go for party advantage, as ever.
How long before Douglas Carswell defects back to the Tories? #UKIP
Was with Farage on the need for radical political reform until he said it would be led by UKIP.
@charlesarthur Five years of vile lies &amp; character assassination in the press - he was always going to struggle in the face of that.
Why we need #ElectoralReform: SNP - 1.4m votes, 56 seats; Lib Dems - 2.3m, 8 seats; UKIP - 3.7m, 1 seat; Greens - 1.1m, 1 seat.
Small majority means Cameron is hostage to his own right-wing. Expect much Euro-nuttery in run-up to #Brexit referendum.
Defeated MPs who left the title in their Twitter handle because it was ‘too hard’ to change are now going to have to work out how.
Ex-#Newham Mayoral candidate, serial litigant &amp; jailbird Kamran Malik got just 170 votes in Brent Central for his Communities United Party
@brianmoore666 Cue 2 years of the Tory party ripping itself to pieces over EU while voters turn away in disgust. #silverlining
@60Sparkle No real change until we get electoral reform - which the big parties have zero interest in.
@Arf_22 Stephen Timms’ share increased too. And at 78% I haven’t seen anyone with more (I’m desperately looking for positives here!)
@Arf_22 But a very, very distant third.
@StopCityAirport SNP did and reaped the rewards. Lesson there for Blairites who want Labour to move further right
Former #Newham mayoral candidate Stefan Mrozinski fails to unseat David Lammy in Tottenham. Tory share of vote falls by 3%.
@notonlywords And Galloway losing his.
Ashcroft says Tories should now pass their gerrymandering boundary changes to reduce Commons to 600 MPs. Not a word on fair votes though.
Financial markets love ‘certainty’, we are told. Two years of Tory-induced chaos over our EU membership should be an absolute riot then.
@LordAshcroft @timrollpickerin Why is that a priority ahead of electoral reform? #gerrymandering
It seems reports of the death of the influence of newspapers are much exaggerated. #GE2015
Architect of Labour's austerity-lite economic plan has been defeated. No great loss, IMHO. Party needed to offer a clear alternative #GE2015
8,000 majority for @CarolineLucas in Brighton. Congratulations!
LAB - 45 (7 gains)  
CON - 29 (3 gains)  
LIB DEM - 1

Would like to be a fly on the wall at #Newham Labour group on Monday night when @CharleneMcLean_ walks back into the room #frosty
@fussellface Did better in West Ham - 5% and in council by-election- a highly creditable 14% &amp; 3rd place.
@timrollpickerin I predicted @fest4westham would get 15% and that LibDem would lose his deposit. Right on both counts!
#EastHam result: Labour 40563 (78%); Cons 6311 (12%); UKIP 2622 (5%); Green 1299 (2%); LibDem 856 (1.5%) #Newham
#WestHam result: Labour 36132 (68%); Cons 8146 (15%); UKIP 3950 (7%); Green 2651 (5%); LibDem 1430 (3%) #Newham
Well done to @NewhamGreens &amp; @bicyclettebleue on getting 14% in #SNTbyelection - huge achievement from a zero base in that ward #Newham
#SNTbyelection result: Lab 4607 (57%); Cons 1778 (22%); Greens 1170 (14%); UKIP 403 (5%); others 169 (2%) #Newham
@jamogram Are they letting you cycle round the track?
@NewhamRecorder Nothing to stop councillors doing that outside of election campaigns, is there?
Those #Newham Labour councillors who campaigned in Scotland did so for nothing. Their candidate came a distant third.
@peterjukes Isn't that exactly what Cameron and the press have been doing for the past month?
@notonlywords One possibility is Cameron can't get a bill on EU referendum through. Other than UKIP, who else will back him?
@notonlywords Last hope is it's not quite so bad - Tories round 300 Labour 260-ish. But that's not much to cling to.
@notonlywords Looking very bad now. Lib Dem vote going to Tories not Labour. Even London not looking good.
@notonlywords There are other exit polls/forecasts that are less grim.
@timrollpickerin Are you there? What time will Stratford result be announced?
Rumours of Galloway losing in Bradford. Fingers crossed.
@ianpocock On 316 Cameron can go it alone pretty comfortably. Throw a bit of pork at DUP &amp; they'll be happy enough.
@ianpocock Yep. Big 'if' on that poll though.
@GMillerTN23 Just spotted BBC exit poll is forecasting Thurrock as a Labour gain. A red brick on Jeremy Vine's path to No.10!
@GMillerTN23 Hope it goes your way - not just in Thurrock.
Last RT comes with a large, quizzical 'hmmm'

CON = 280

LAB = 274

LIB DEM = 21

SNP = 52
Either every poll for the past six weeks has been wrong, or one exit poll is wrong. What to think? #GE2015
@SeyiAkiwowo YouGov exit poll is very different. Take heart!
@parkerdairies Fascinating programme though
“Found my Mecca near Tottenham Hale station;
I discovered heaven on the Seven Sisters Road.“
Listening to the Leyton Buzzards’ ‘Saturday Night Beneath the Plastic Palm Trees’.
@Driver_8_Ace Switch to Tweetbot. You don’t see promoted tweets at all.
Anyone interested in a swift half in @ForestTavern at 6?
@notonlywords @adamcranfield Have done so! #COYS
Do Spurs have the worst defence in the world? @notonlywords investigates 
@probablygeorge @edmclarnon But your new job will be at minimum wage and on a zero hours contract.
Beware judging the election mood by the contents of your own Twitter stream. Double confirmation bias right there.
Don’t know if @Telegraph’s panicky ‘vote Tory’ email to its marketing lists was legal, but it feels icky - like a line has been crossed.
@iainaitch #IVoted at 07.00 and there were already 5 people ahead of me in the queue.
@NewhamSue Good luck!
@gate7yoga I doubt the results in either seat will be worth much comment. Unless the Greens unseat the Tories as (distant) runners-up!
@fest4westham @timrollpickerin Been here since ’89, so it goes a way back! All previous Tories utterly invisible.
@fest4westham @timrollpickerin You deserve a crack at a more winnable seat next time.
@fest4westham @timrollpickerin You fought a better campaign than any Tory candidate I can remember in West Ham.
@gate7yoga @ViksE15 @NewhamLondon @EllieCRobinson Online map &amp; polling station finder here: 
@SeyiAkiwowo If Godwin is still a polling station why was ours changed to St Mark’s Church? I only spotted it on the polling card today!
@drhotspur I also have the new iOS Outlook app on my iPhone &amp; iPad purely for work emails. Fantastic.
@fest4westham @timrollpickerin *blushes*
@drhotspur I had an issue on the first attempt. Uninstalled and tried again - it worked perfectly. Hooked up to company Exchange server.
@drhotspur I have the new Outlook and much prefer it to the previous version (though I thought Entourage far better than either of them)
@timrollpickerin @fest4westham Sir, I salute your indefatigability!
@drhotspur I was offered the chance to test that at work, but advised not to by a colleague that had. Your experience?
@ColinAGrainger Same question applies to so many ‘pundits’ (and politicians!)
@drhotspur No perfect system, but this one is less perfect than a proportional system. Which is the best PR system is up for debate.
@drhotspur FPTP works with 2, maybe 3, parties. With 6 or 7 it’s hopeless. Much as I hate UKIP, 12% of the vote &amp; 1 or 2 MPs is unfair.
@drhotspur Because in 500+ of the 650 seats the result is a foregone conclusion. And millions vote for parties that get no voice.
#IVoted even though it won’t affect the outcome in my super-safe seat. Hope this is the end of our idiotic &amp; broken electoral system.
@dominiccampbell Turn up &amp; abstain in person!
@RitsChadha isn’t he out in Ilford North doing early morning leafleting? #fiftyshadesofgrayee
Good job I checked my polling card before settling out to vote. Our local polling station’s moved! Anyway, duty done. #GE2015
@probablygeorge @snoxishere I work on the 5th floor. Can't get much closer.
@G_Rak Good luck!
@NewhamGreens @LawMike Don't be sad: we have one more day of 'get out the vote' selfies to enjoy.
@hughbarnard Forgive my gullible consumerism! #shiny
@MeatPieTits @jamogram If only we could interest enough people to put that to the test.
@drhotspur They have all 3 on display. If I bought one I’d go for space grey.
MacBook keyboard isn’t a deal-breaker though: I can still type comfortably on it. Screen is gorgeous &amp; machine is super-light.
In non-election news, I had a play with the new MacBook at the Apple Store. Keyboard is a bit weird - like typing on an iPad, but not quite.
Next week’s AGM will be the first council meeting for whoever wins the Stratford by-election. #SNTbyelection #Newham
#Newham council AGM next Thursday (14th). Stratford Town Hall, 7pm. “The Mayor of Newham, Sir Robin Wales invites all residents to attend.”
With polls still showing Cons &amp; Labour in a dead heat Fleet Street is going to go absolutely ment… oh, they already did that #GE2015


Plus love the URL!!! #DoN…
@SeyiAkiwowo @kayscoresby @lynbrownmp Four Seasons In One Day
@Khyberman RedKippers and BlueKippers. Are those really a thing? What distinguishes one from the other?

Articles like that in Homes &amp; Property become a self-fulfilling prophesy as greedy investors pile in &amp; price ordinary buyers out. #Newham
House price inflation is creating a crisis. The only solution is to build more homes for social and genuinely affordable rents. #Newham
How much of that is driven by ordinary people buying homes &amp; how much by ‘investors’? How many of those new flats are even occupied? #Newham
…as well as strong demand for new-build flats at Royal Victoria Docks &amp; the former Olympic Village. 
Average price of a home in #Newham has now reached £291,364, boosted by Crossrail in areas such as Custom House, Stratford &amp; Forest Gate…
@jamogram Any good reason why a web developer would implement that? I can’t think of one off the top of my head.
If you’re having trouble with the link to #Newham’s planning enforcement notice to Cllr Noor, use this: 
@jamogram Brilliant! Thanks. Have replaced the link in my blog post with that.
Mail headline: “Don’t let a class war zealot &amp; the SNP destroy our economy”. Clarion call to vote Labour if ever I heard one! #GE2015
@jamogram If I go via the route I mentioned last night it works perfectly. Exactly the same URI for the document.
@jamogram Weird. It 404s in Chrome now, but works fine in Safari &amp; in Tweetbot’s built-in browser on my iPad.
ICYMI last night: Oh Noor! #Newham councillor has an enforcement notice served on him - by his own council! 
Link to the enforcement notice issued against Cllr Ahmed Noor is working again. 
@NewhamLondon The enforcement notice link seems to be working again. Odd that it disappeared though (not just for me - others got 404s too).
‘Pig’s ear’, ‘bacon’, ‘porkies’, picture of Ed Miliband. What exactly is the Sun trying to say? 
@iainaitch @hughbarnard Probably got a poison-tipped blade hidden in the toe of her shoe. (guess who just re-watched From Russia With Love)
Phantom leafleter of #ForestGate strikes again with a message for #GE2015 voters 
@jamogram @hughbarnard @StopCityAirport Curious that the docs are misdated on that screen - wonder how that happened?
@jamogram @hughbarnard @StopCityAirport In the window that appears, it’s the top one. Oddly dated 2013. No idea why.
@jamogram @hughbarnard @StopCityAirport Try this: 
@jamogram @hughbarnard @StopCityAirport Don’t know.
@NewhamLondon Can you explain why this document has suddenly disappeared from your planning &amp; enforcement portal? 
@jamogram @hughbarnard @StopCityAirport I’ve updated the link in the blog post to point at the Dropbox copy.
@hughbarnard @jamogram @StopCityAirport Does this one work? 
@hughbarnard @jamogram @StopCityAirport 404s on my machine now too. I'll see if I can retrace my steps.
@jamogram I'll see if it still works from my laptop - I haven't cleared cookies or data.
@jamogram URI doesn't look like it's got any session-based data in it. Maybe they've taken it down (which would be alarming).
@jamogram @StopCityAirport I downloaded a copy. I'll email you.
@StopCityAirport But it doesn't appear to have an HMO licence either, but that's a different (&amp; even more awkward) matter.
@StopCityAirport Strictly speaking it's a planning enforcement - the property was converted from office to HMO without permission.
@Eat16Cafe @iainaitch @emmahudds And swans around in a huge Merc with a personalised number plate.
I’m #NotVotingUKIP because I’m choosing HOPE over fear this Thursday #hopenothate #GE2015
@emmahudds @iainaitch Sad for those who live there, in substandard accommodation. And who will now be homeless though no fault of their own.
New blog post: Oh Noor! #Newham councillor has an enforcement notice served on him - by his own council! 
@timrollpickerin @electoralreform @AlexRunswick So we should keep using a broken system for fear it’s too hard to explain the alternative?
@timrollpickerin @electoralreform @AlexRunswick What makes you think STV is ‘too hard’ for ordinary voters to understand?
@timrollpickerin @electoralreform @AlexRunswick But Tim, we have PR (of sorts) in EP &amp; mayoral elections. Scots &amp; Welsh for own parliaments.
@Rusty123B @shitlondon Revenge of the Fifth
'Face it Britain – you've got a weird electoral system’. 3 European journalists look at the election: 
The Tories are no longer a UK party. Now the English National Party in all but name. 
Can't believe I missed this yesterday from @print_movement: 
@BenPearceSpurs Thought Lamela was frustratingly in-and-out today. Chadli was much more effective. Bentaleb was my man of the match.
@terrympaul As i’m not a party member I can say things like that. Not sure you should be though (ahead of polling day).
@BenPearceSpurs Is Townsend injured? If not, it’s odd he’s not in the squad.
@URamani I wish I could share your optimism.
@timothy_stanley And equally didn't need to pass a law to ensure they'd keep their own promises. We are led by idiots.
@campbellclaret @UKLabour Would you have allowed #EdStone to get any further than a doodle on a special advisor's notepad?
#MiliHenge feels like this election's Sheffield Rally moment. My head is in my hands in despair. #GE2015
Tory tactics are working: all interviews with Labour now focused on SNP 'deals', not policy. And they wonder why people are disengaged.
One thing I agree with Farage about: 'first past the post' is bankrupt &amp; needs to be replaced. #Marr #electoralreform
Farage interviewed on the BBC says the BBC has been ignoring him. #Marr
@bbcnickrobinson Will he apologise on behalf of his rich mates for crashing the economy &amp; for making the rest of us pick up the bill?
@bbcnickrobinson If the last Labour govt was overspending by so much, why did he &amp; Osborne promise to match their commitments in 2007?
@probablygeorge As an older man with very poor eyesight I found that riveting!
@probablygeorge Just got to ‘cumulative’. Even weirder than ‘Pix-L-meh-tor’
@Margin4Error Ditto. #SafeSeat #WestHam #GE2015
Robin Wales has some fucking brass neck posing for this photo with @CharleneMcLean_  
@StopCityAirport My horrible feeling is the Tories will sneak back (in some kind of coalition with LibDems &amp; DUP).
@StopCityAirport Wouldn’t bet against another election in October. Or early next year. Leadership election is not what Labour needs.
@StopCityAirport Summer recess isn’t far away. Take a break, come back in the autumn refreshed and ready to go.
@StopCityAirport With no likely winner they’re all losers. And I’d dispute the need for Miliband to go if numbers are quite close.
@danbenjamin @OvercastFM Subscribed.
@fussellface @8ballbikes Try and wrap your bicycling brain around this: 
Five years on &amp; the Tories are still banging on about that stupid letter. FFS. #GE2015
You want someone beholden to Murdoch &amp; the Daily Mail deciding what happens to the BBC? Seriously? #GE2015
BBC Charter is up for renewal in 2016. Whoever wins #GE2015 gets to determine the future of our national broadcaster. Think about that.
Farage is having a hissy-fit about the BBC not being sufficiently arse-kissy towards UKIP; threatening to slash their funding. #GE2015
@iainaitch @fest4westham In one of the mayor’s more modest months
@iainaitch @fest4westham Wales always has lots of photos of himself; Wales always wins. Therefore … #logic
@fest4westham Only tweeting links to polls that put your party ahead is one of the more ridiculous features (by both sides) of the election.
@fest4westham But then this says otherwise: 
@philmonkey That elsewhere is here. One month to go…
@atticrahman @NewhamGreens Well, if it comes down to it we'll all be on the same side in 2017. Which will feel a bit strange!
@atticrahman Okay, fair enough. Your tweet crossed with mine.
@atticrahman I asked you a direct question &amp; you've dodged it. You may disagree with him, but Miliband is absolutely clear where he stands.
@atticrahman Let's make this simple: in on current terms, or out? Which side are you &amp; your party campaigning on?
@atticrahman If Cameron gets nothing bar a few cosmetic changes, which way do the Tories campaign- in or out?
@atticrahman You think the other EU will agree? Not a chance. You’ll waste 2 years focusing on that while business stops investing. Idiotic.
@atticrahman I’m talking about the madness of an EU referendum, promised with no clue about the terms you extract from the other 27 states.
@atticrahman You are giving us two years of chaos &amp; uncertainty. And all to chase UKIP votes &amp; appease your own right wing.
FT backs Cameron because Miliband is too ”preoccupied with inequality.“ Sociopathic capitalism in a nutshell. #GE2015
Heading to East Ham Town Hall for the 2nd time this week - governors’ forum tonight. Hopefully Cllr Peppiatt puts in an appearance.
@grayee @carotomes #headdesk
Oh dear. ‘Libertarian, pro-free speech’ UKIP complains over BBC quiz show: 
@khalillaher @Rachel_shares @NewhamGreens @stephenctimms As I said, “may have something to do with it” - and it does.
@khalillaher @Rachel_shares @NewhamGreens But you tweeted that yourself as a reason: 
@Rachel_shares @khalillaher @NewhamGreens I suspect Timms anti marriage equality stance may have something to do with it.
@fussellface @gate7yoga @ForestGreat @Waayourigong @EccentricLDNer That’s what they told me when I went in the day before they closed.
@Rachel_shares @MrUnexpected Oh yes. And that hasn’t been responded to either.
@Rachel_shares @MrUnexpected My FOI on the East Ham Town Hall overspend was submitted last November. Still no answer.
@TedJeory What makes you think Labour will scrap it? I wish they would, but nothing I’ve seen suggests it.

@NewhamSue For the second night running you've been stood up by the mayor! #WheresRobin?
@alister_b I think the Belgian economy out-paced ours while we had an active  government &amp; they didn’t.

@TheWansteadtap @ForestGreat Someone tell the Siam Café people!
@e7chat @Strettons1931 It would have to be a Little Waitrose.
@60Sparkle That politics can make a difference &amp; that voting matters.
@iainaitch Mind if I join you?
@iainaitch You in the area? I’m at the south end of Gt Portland St if you fancy a coffee.
@60Sparkle And for the kind of people who sympathise with Brand that’s an important message for him to get across.
@60Sparkle Didn’t he say something about people who committed fraud? But his overall point was voting matters &amp; can change things.
Miliband takes Brand seriously but doesn’t accept his premise that politics is pointless &amp; voting changes nothing. #Milibrand
@IsabelHardman @tomcopley Likewise mirroring body &amp; hand gestures.
The occasional Mockney glottal stop aside, I think Ed Miliband comes out of this pretty well 
@carotomes ‘What do we want?’ ‘Helvetica Neue’ ‘When do we want it?’ ‘Now!’
@1000cuts @AdamBienkov Why not? They have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, which is elected on PR basis.
@hrtbps Faceless Eurocrats
The point at which I depart from @DanHannanMEP on #electoralreform is the timetable for implementation: too slow: 
Is there actually any evidence to support the old saw that ad weather on polling day is bad news for Labour? #GE2015
@YesForLab @AlbertoNardelli I think you might be right (and very much hope so).
Hacking with #beacons. Some really great ideas. 
@KristoferKeane @AlbertoNardelli But Tory press will fight any govt led by 2nd largest party on grounds of legitimacy. It’s about the optics
@AlbertoNardelli SNP seriously want to keep the Tories out? They should think about ‘throwing’ a few seats so Labour are largest party.
@hotdogsladies @danbenjamin Re: mashups, “Spending one of these nights with Kelly Clarkson” is awesome 
#TransformHack came up with great ideas for using beacons in hospitals, schools, shopping centres &amp; petrol stations 
@neilmonnery @markpack If the Telegraph told me it was Wednesday tomorrow I'd check the calendar. No longer a serious or credible newspaper.
#NewhamOSC Ahmed Noor now flattering the chair for his conduct of meetings. Audible sigh from elsewhere in the room.
#NewhamOSC members now saying other aspects have scrutiny have been scuppered by lack of cooperation - e.g. budget, children &amp; young people.
@jamogram Certainly gave the legal officer freer rein to talk. And mayor has pissed a lot of members off by blocking witnesses.
#NewhamOSC now moving on to the draft of their annual report.
@RitsChadha Nope.
@jamogram He has a work programme to get through… but I suspect the mood of the meeting is against him.
@jamogram They wanted another meeting to gather more evidence by interrogating members &amp; officers. Not ready to draw conclusions.
#NewhamOSC @kayscoresby has evidence from outside the committee process. Asks legal officer how this can be included in their considerations
#NewhamOSC @NewhamSue &amp; @kayscoresby talking about the way scrutiny has been treated, been blocked from getting proper evidence.
#NewhamOSC @berchinan saying committee is now moving into 'recommendation mode.' That's not what members were saying earlier.
#NewhamOSC Estimated cost of legal advice that was then ignored - c.£10,000.
#NewhamOSC @berchinan says Kim BD has told the committee he didn't know. But why didn't he ask then, enquiries @diannewalls8, reasonably.
#NewhamOSC @diannewalls8 says if there's a new meeting there are serious questions for the chief executive &amp; his handling of this project.
@NewhamGreens @G_Rak Yes. Both here.
#NewhamOSC Cllr Ahmed Noor looks a bit distracted. Legal stuff can be quite challenging.
#NewhamOSC @SeyiAkiwowo says she struggles to understand why officers would have gone so far beyond their remit &amp; not told people.
#NewhamOSC …which is all jolly convenient from Sir Robin's point of view.
#NewhamOSC Only people who can explain what happened to the legal advice &amp; why it was ignored can't tell us because they've left the council
#NewhamOSC Legal officer's demeanour suggests strongly he knows the 'no-one told members' story is not credible.
#NewhamOSC So 'client' got more advice, which said the same thing. Nonetheless the 6th form opened in an illegal form. Legal advice ignored.
#NewhamOSC Legal officer confirms that legal advice said 6th form couldn't legally be opened in the way it was. "Client wasn't happy."
#NewhamOSC have taken this seriously, asked important questions, but written answers "just not telling the truth," says @kayscoresby
#NewhamOSC @diannewalls8 says written answers are quite perfunctory. @kayscoresby says it's quite insulting.
#NewhamOSC @SeyiAkiwowo asks for another meeting after the election when members can come along &amp; answer questions.
#NewhamOSC @rokhsanafiaz says this is not acceptable. Won't be happy to put her name to any report produced under these circumstances.
#NewhamOSC members are quietly expressing a level disapproval. Discussion about new 'protocol'. Legal officer says he objects to it.
#NewhamOSC Witnesses requested by the committee have not turned up. Names submitted to the mayor's office, as per 'protocol' but no show.
#NewhamOSC chair @berchinan opens proceedings. Mayor has delivered written responses to questions, which committee are now reading.
At East Ham Town Hall for #NewhamOSC.
@StarLane_CT @ViksE15 Yes, all three of them.
@JoshFeldberg William Boyd’s James Bond novel ‘Solo’ is really good. And Alan Johnson’s childhood memoir ‘This Boy’ is very moving.
@ruskin147 3D was the answer to a question no-one was asking.
“Anyway… bygones.” *makes dismissive hand-wavy gesture* #NewhamOSC (7/7)
“I’m really focused on how we deal with the savage Tory cuts &amp; if this committee has any ideas I’d love to hear them.” #NewhamOSC (6/7)
“It was ALL THE FAULT OF OFFICERS, who have in any case all now left the employment of the authority.” #NewhamOSC (5/7)
“No elected members were involved in the supervision or governance of the project. This was perfectly normal.” #NewhamOSC (4/7)
“We have provided much-needed 6th form provision. The college is already rated as outstanding in our own assessment.” #NewhamOSC (3/7)
“We’ve built a first class facility &amp; made a vital contribution to the regeneration of East Ham. That’s what’s important.” #NewhamOSC (2/7)
I can save members of #NewhamOSC the trouble of holding tonight’s meeting by summarising the mayor’s evidence in advance (1/7)
@NewhamRecorder That headline is ambiguous - ‘bottom’ could mean lowest levels of incidence, but you mean highest.
#NewhamOSC also expect the mayor &amp; chief executive will be in attendance. Guess we know who’ll do all the talking then.
#NewhamOSC have asked for cllrs Peppiatt &amp; Hudson, someone from audit &amp; Steve Cameron (lead post-16 education officer) as witnesses tonight.
Over at the Guardian @charlesarthur dissects the party manifestos on technology: 
@carotomes I’ve added the Storify link to my blog post from yesterday.
MT @carotomes: "Is the Upton Centre consultation fair?" 
@StopCityAirport @hughbarnard @carotomes Maybe the £100k prices in the cost of the rent subsidy, whereas RDV homes will be full market?
@carotomes @NewhamGreens @stephenctimms @SaveUptonCentre @lynbrownmp I’ll add it to my blog post as an update too.
@StopCityAirport @hughbarnard @carotomes That would be the logical conclusion. Or 10x as many primary school places, etc.
@DenisMacShane I think you mean Griffin, not Griffith. Hope you’re right re defaulting balloon.
Guess I missed the last posting date for #EdBallsDay cards again this year. Damn! #edballs
@BBCNews Despite that Tory letter being exposed as a sham you reported it as fact, with no mention of the deception involved. Why?
My #FOI to #Newham council submitted in November 2014 &amp; still unanswered: 
More than 25% of #FOI requests to #Newham council are not answered on time. Shocking. 
“If the UK can be mortally wounded by a 5-week campaign run by a hopelessly unpopular party, is it so robust anyway?” 
@diannewalls8 Who are the witnesses tonight? #NewhamOSC
@CannHallERA @SparrowhawkSo @daisyparker Ours have been in Scotland!
@StopCityAirport @60Sparkle A personal favourite of mine: Sugarcult 
@StopCityAirport @60Sparkle Foo Fighters. Weezer. Green Day.
@daisyparker Woot!
@DerkHat I have Cee Lo Green’s The Lady Killer &amp; it’s excellent.
Tory small business ‘letter’ having proved a damp squib they’re back to the Ed &amp; Nicola scaremongering tonight. Desperate stuff. #GE2015
@SaveUptonCentre @carotomes @ViksE15 @Plaistow_South Cllr Noor is also a landlord so I don’t think you owe him an apology.
@carotomes @ViksE15 @Neiljwilson @Plaistow_South From what I gather Cllr Noor is especially uninterested in being helpful.
@carotomes I might ask around. But wouldn’t be surprised if that’s news to everyone!
@DerkHat Me neither.
Mind you, none of the other parties have knocked either. Going through the motions. #SafeSeat #GE2015
Personal election update: Labour leaflet delivered yesterday. No knock, no attempt to talk to me, just shoved through the door. #GE2015
@carotomes Slightly less surprised then!
@carotomes Which ward are you in?
@carotomes @NewhamLondon @SaveUptonCentre Email your councillors with detailed critique (&amp; screenshots) - firstname.lastname@newham.gov.uk
New blog post: Leading questions 
Take a read back through @carotomes’ timeline to see her critique of @NewhamLondon’s supposed ‘consultation’ on the Upton Centre #Newham
@carotomes As I’ve just now spotted!
@carotomes Imagine if they’d consulted on the £40m Olympic stadium loan &amp; asked the same question with the same comparators!
@fishie1 They were there this morning as I left the house at 7.
Greens pledge to end 'Right to Buy’. Saying what Labour is still far too timid to say: 
@campbellclaret @karren_brady Or about the £40m Labour-run Newham is contributing to the cost of relocating her business? #scrounger
@jamogram I’m not surprised. Large parts of Newham Labour are more or less moribund, which suits the leadership just fine.
@jamogram Maybe… and I’m guessing from your recent tweets it’s one you’ve taken.
@UKLabour @Debbie_abrahams If I lived anywhere but Newham that *might* be an option…
.@HACANEast on how @NewhamLondon, lacking the confidence to say no to City Airport expansion, lets local people down 
@fishie1 @EccentricLDNer I saw @CoLEppingForest keepers going to talk to them at lunchtime.
@RitsChadha Someone just posted a spam link to the Newham e-democracy forum using your name.
Excellent: what Tesco tells us about capitalism when it focuses on shareholders not customers: 
@NewhamGreens All those new apartment blocks going up, adding thousands of new homes, yet overcrowding is on the rise. What does that say?
@NewhamGreens And one in four are overcrowded.
@rupertmurdoch @peterjukes What is the basis for that forecast, beyond wishful thinking?
@bbcnickrobinson No wry comment to make on Boris's interview? How about his refusal to rule out a UKIP deal? #Marr
Not a word from Boris on #Marr about Tory policy. They've got nothing to offer but fear &amp; division. #GE2015
Entirety of BoJo's #Marr interview focused on scaremongering about prospect of SNP influence on a Miliband government. #GE2015
With both #Newham seats safely in the bag local councillors (&amp; Stephen Timms) head off to campaign in Scotland 
@IainDale But doesn’t it just come down to Johnson vs May in the end?
@LawMike Spotted him in a couple (literally) of doorstep selfies in East Ham. Not exactly putting in the hard yards for the party.
@grayee @WestHamLabour Red Tel? I think @terrympaul needs to have a word with his branding agency!
@ViksE15 @NewhamLondon It’s all Sharepoint. And that’s half the problem right there!
@carotomes To be fair to @fest4westham he has engaged quite a lot with me &amp; others on Twitter. Maybe not the best use of his time though!
@fest4westham I meant your party in general. Five years in power &amp; all they’ve got is Red Ed &amp; Scary Scottish people. It’s pathetic.
@NewhamGreens @Rachel_shares @dustydaz Actually put my 2 copies straight in recycling as well. But I saw someone say there was only one pic!
@fest4westham I could go on, but at this point I am so utterly revolted by the whole thing I can’t bring myself to.
@fest4westham Also, basing your entire re-election strategy around whipping up anti-Scottish resentments is worse.
@fest4westham No, pretending someone said something they didn’t actually say &amp; then confecting a bogus outrage is worse.
Take a look at @deedubbleyoo’s slides from his #DigitalFWD talk last night. Good stuff! 
Even by the Telegraph’s pathetic standards this is ridiculous 
New blog post: A walk on part in the war - #Newham cllr Ken Clark’s brief appearance in the Lutfur Rahman judgement 
@StopCityAirport A Tory/UKIP/DUP alliance is a truly terrifying prospect.
@StopCityAirport And Cameron may rely on them to prop him up in power. Far more disturbing than any Labour/SNP arrangement.
@Mike_Fabricant @atticrahman But this isn’t? 
@YehudaShapiro @bbcproms Bet they have ‘average visit duration’ (aka ‘wasting the user’s time’) as one of their KPIs.
Cameron playing the English nationalist card again. Perverse from the leader of what was once the Conservative &amp; Unionist Party. #GE2015
@YehudaShapiro @bbcproms Bet they didn’t have a #UX researcher on the project then!
@forzagaribaldi @gawdblimeyguvna @EccentricLDNer That’s great, thanks.
@RooftopJaxx @StopCityAirport GLA &amp; London mayor elections in 2016. Wonder if Biggs wins in TH if there’ll be a by-election for his GLA seat
@Rachel_shares @SaveUptonCentre @NewhamGreens It isn’t the first time &amp; it won’t be the last.

@jonworth Worth reading back through @TedJeory’s timeline for minute-by-minute coverage of the judgement.
@Rachel_shares @rectripp Nasty, corrupt, sectarian, confessional politics gets the kicking it so thoroughly deserves. #TowerHamlets
@RooftopJaxx @StopCityAirport Next local elections in London are 2018.
@StopCityAirport @RooftopJaxx Here’s the bit on Newham’s website about it. Should be something similar on LBTH’s 
@StopCityAirport @RooftopJaxx Referendum. Needs a petition signed by 5% of registered voters to hold one.
@IainDale Guess @MayorLutfur now needs to change his Twitter handle.
@RooftopJaxx No, the day that nasty, corrupt, sectarian, confessional politics got the kicking it so thoroughly deserved. #TowerHamlets

@juliannemarriot Welcome to our hipster paradise.
@Driver_8_Ace I feel your pain. I've literally just seen someone use the word 'glastobating' on Twitter.
@stephenctimms He says it’s a printer’s error. I say it shows a worrying lack of attention to detail. Not something I want in a legislator!
@juliannemarriot Pitifully small. And still no on-site parking? Local residents won’t thank you if you approve that.
Amazon is offering goat grazing services. Seriously! 
@juliannemarriot Is Morgan House developer still offering zero affordable homes &amp; zero parking spaces? Both grounds for saying no.

Congratulations to fan-owned FC United of Manchester, promoted to Conference North 
@NewhamGreens @Rachel_shares As she has done on Twitter. My complaint is more that this is the consequence of FPTP &amp; being in a safe seat.
@Arf_22 Happy birthday! 24 - I remember 24… vaguely.
@SparrowhawkSo First past the post. Safe seat. Election, what election?
Given his track record, I don’t believe a word @grantshapps says about his Wikipedia sock puppetry. #MichaelGreen #SebastianFox #contribsx
My election so far: leaflets 3 (Tory, Lib Dem, CUP); mail shot 1 (Labour); canvassers 0. #GE2015 #WestHam

@StopCityAirport @CodyDock @rokhsanafiaz @juliannemarriot #HeroesOfSocialistLabour
@jamogram @EastEndNewham Meanwhile their West Ham candidate is badgering Lyn Brown about the mansion tax, like that’s an issue here.
@fghays22 @fest4westham @StarLane_CT @lynbrownmp This is my point. If Festus wants votes he needs to find an issue local people care about.
@StarLane_CT @fest4westham @lynbrownmp Threshold will rise each year, so even if my house ends up being worth £2m it won’t be liable.
@StarLane_CT @fest4westham @lynbrownmp Let me know when that bubble reaches Capel Rd!
@fghays22 Next Tuesday, 7 pm at East Ham Town Hall, according to the agenda online.
@fest4westham @StarLane_CT Not my place to defend @lynbrownmp or @UKLabour but that is just wild &amp; baseless speculation.
@StarLane_CT @fest4westham @lynbrownmp I think the proposed threshold is £2m. Are there even any £1m homes in West Ham?
Final meeting of #NewhamOSC on East Ham Town Hall &amp; 6th Form Collegiate is next Tuesday.
Evidence from @conormmcauley on member &amp; mayoral involvement is especially interesting #NewhamOSC 
Minutes of #NewhamOSC March meeting now online. Worth a read if you’ve been following the East Ham Town Hall fiasco 
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp I have no special access to Lyn, so my entreaties are unlikely to be make any difference.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp I’m trying to help you focus on issues that actually affect local people. Feel free to ignore me if you like.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Sorry, typo. Non-doms, obviously.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp I meant non-coms, but I suppose they are more likely than West Hammers to be caught be the mansion tax.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp And Trident isn’t much of a differentiator with Labour - they’re committed to replacement as well.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp If you mean defending tax dodgers, I’d advise against it. Unlikely to find much sympathy for them on the doorstep.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Indeed, but this is West Ham, not West Hampstead. The housing profile is very different.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Paying it is unlikely to be much of an issue for your prospective constituents. Maybe focus on things that are?
Arrogance of Boris &amp; Sir Robin puts #WHUFC at risk of paying millions in compensation for ‘state aid’ in Olympic Stadium move.
Ha ha! West Ham face compensation risk over ‘state aid’ for Olympic Stadium refit. 
@Rachel_shares Thanks for all your answers.
@TahirMirza01 Still can't see him. Unless he's the bloke in blue jeans walking out of shot.
@60Sparkle On the Recorder website.
@TahirMirza01 Where?
@TahirMirza01 @stephenctimms @unmeshdesai @labourpress @easthamlabour @ArmitageJW Er, Sir Robin's not in that picture is he?
@timrollpickerin @lynbrownmp Safari on iPad didn't show all of the threads. Chrome does.
@ukhousingaction Here: 
@lynbrownmp Tried a different browser &amp; can now see all your answers #NewhamAsks
@lynbrownmp Maybe.
@lynbrownmp I can only your response to me &amp; on @FocusE15. I'm on the Recorder website.
Is @lynbrownmp's computer not working? She's only answered one question (mine, as it happens) #NewhamAsks
#NewhamAsks Debate is going on here: 
#NewhamAsks If you don't already live here, will you commit to making Newham your home if elected?
#NewhamAsks If elected, will you commit 100% of your time to being an MP or will you maintain a second job?
@E7Drew If Labour aren’t largest party right-wing media will declare Cameron the winner &amp; make it impossible for Miliband to govern.
@E7Drew Tory lead in both Ashcroft &amp; Guardian/ICM. Seat projections have them slightly ahead too.
Not much to be cheerful about in today’s polls. #GE2015
@Rachel_shares @NewhamRecorder I’ve already submitted a few. Wonder if they’ll get used.
Wow! Even by #Newham council standards the Mayoral Proceedings held on 2 April were brief - just 3 minutes to cover 7 agenda items.
@LouiseNornes @Coffee7FG #jealous
#NewhamAsks Do you support electoral reform &amp; the introduction of proportional representation for local government in England?
#NewhamAsks We suffer massive health inequalities compared to better-off areas. How can we improve public health &amp; increase life expectancy?
#NewhamAsks If Cameron wins he promises a free vote in the Commons on repeal of the fox hunting ban. How would you vote in that division?
#NewhamAsks The ‘recovery’ has left a lot of people in Newham behind. How will you help them catch back up?
#NewhamAsks In a referendum on continued UK membership of the EU, which side would you campaign for - in or out?
#NewhamAsks Official statistics show that 25.2% of households in our borough are overcrowded. What do you propose to do to address this?
@peterwalker99 Our local Tory also features picture of Boris (&amp; endorsement by him), but no sign of Cameron. Lib Dem leaflet has no Clegg.
@StopCityAirport Current Boleyn Ground proposal &lt;10%; Morgan House (Stratford Centre) = 0%
@fest4westham 97% of scientists agree climate change is happening &amp; needs to be addressed. How much more consensus do you need?
@grayee @FarahNazeer You left out the (one &amp; only) picture of the Mayor, holding up a sign in East Ham before scarpering off to the pub.
@fest4westham You shouldn’t believe what you see in CCHQ-edited videos.
@fest4westham Excuses, excuses: It won’t work. It’s too complicated. It’s not the right time.
@copwatcher And closer to home, the Siam Café in forest Gate has closed after its landlord jacked up the rent.
@fest4westham But the basic injustice remains. Labour have promised to deal with that. Your party appears to be defending tax dodgers.
@fest4westham Non-dom tax breaks create massive distortions in the economy. Them leaving would probably be beneficial in the long run.
@fest4westham They live here, they should pay their taxes here. In full. Don’t like it? Leave. I’m happy with that.
@jamogram @fest4westham Absolutely. Once the rich have taken everything &amp; the poor can’t afford to buy anything, the whole thing collapses.
@fest4westham That there needs to be a significant redistribution of wealth away from the rich towards the poor? Yes.
@fest4westham 110,000 very rich people pay more tax than 10 million poor people , even when they get a huge break. Massive inequality.
@fest4westham Which only proves the Left’s point about a massive &amp; growing difference between the super-rich &amp; the rest of us.
@marcoarment iPhone 5c users = all iPad users put together?
Tory logic: Scots should stay in the UK, but horrifying that the MPs they elect might play a part in the country’s government. #GE2015
Only disappointment was Lamela. His first touch would embarrass a League One journeyman. #THFC #COYS
Bentaleb &amp; Paulinho made a pretty decent partnership in midfield. Mason hasn't been up to it for weeks, so a change was needed. #THFC #COYS

@mrstevenson Me too. It's been here as long as I can remember. Always good food &amp; very reasonably priced. What we need more of.
@mrstevenson Tonight’s their last night. Was very busy last night when I picked up a final takeaway. Probably be rammed tonight too.
@Waayourigong Pop round &amp; tell them!
@Waayourigong That’s what they told me.
He lives! Lord be praised - here, at last, is a sighting of the mayor. Shamed into a brief campaign appearance 
And here’s East Ham CLP on the campaign trail. No sign of the mayor here either. #WheresRobin? 
If the Siam Cafe is being put out of business by a 145% rent increase #ForestGate’s revival is going to be killed by greedy landlords.
Here’s @WestHamLabour out campaigning for @lynbrownmp. But #WheresRobin? 
@print_movement @Waayourigong I think ‘greed’ may be the g-word you are looking for.
@Waayourigong Had our last takeaway from there last night. Hope they find new premises soon.
@Eat16Cafe In which context, this might be of interest: 
Another day, another #Newham Labour campaign photo &amp; still no sign of the mayor. I’m starting to worry. #WheresRobin? 
@timrollpickerin Losing his deposit in West Ham will do his reputation no favours then.
West Ham Labour leaflet has long since been recycled so I’ve no idea if it featured Ed Miliband or not. #GE2015
By contrast to Tories &amp; Lib Dems the Communities United Party leaflet features their leader prominently. And he’s a convicted crook. #GE2015
Odd that candidates of the two parties of government are so embarrassed by their leaders that they’ve omitted all mention of them. #GE2015
West Ham Tory leaflet has picture of &amp; endorsement by Boris, but no sign or mention of Cameron. #GE2015
Hard to tell from Lib Dem leaflet for West Ham candidate who he’s standing for. Almost no branding &amp; complete absence of Nick Clegg. #GE2015
@atticrahman @fest4westham @jamogram @lynbrownmp Yeah, like Cameron ‘won’ last night! #spin
@StopCityAirport For your perusal &amp; entertainment 
New blog post: Who wants to be a millionaire? #Newham Labour’s buy-to-let property queen 
@fest4westham @LawMike Trust me, Festus, understanding the background to this will only reduce your will to live.
@LawMike I think @fest4westham is reading it without the benefit of the context in which you raised it again.
@mylastsong: Warning of 'funeral time bomb' in UK - 
I’m expecting a deluge of #LabourDoorstep selfies over the weekend from #Newham councillors. Will anyone spot the mayor? #WheresRobin
@StopCityAirport Or this one: 
The new James Bond theme? #itsgottobebassey 
@gruber Spectre theme song? #itsgottobebassey 
@jamogram Macho rhetoric combined with moral cowardice. Hallmarks of the bully throughout history.
@nick_clegg @LibDems @roblobue If not invited why didn’t you ask to participate? Did Dave tell you not to?
@jamogram I’d love to see West Ham hustings. But @fest4westham is in no position to claim moral high ground if @lynbrownmp declines.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Missing the point. Cameron won’t face his only serious challenger face to face. That’s what voters want to see.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp One single debate with 6 others. Refuses head-to-head vs the only other leader who might become PM. #chicken
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Save yourself the effort. Seriously. I’m sick of the lies, cant and hypocrisy.
@fest4westham @lynbrownmp Which only happened because Cameron REFUSED to participate. You can’t pretend otherwise.
@fest4westham As your leader won’t debate to defend his 5 yr record as PM it’s hard for you to claim the moral high ground vs @lynbrownmp
Poor @nick_clegg, dutifully fagging for Cameron again 
@atticrahman Manifesto. Don't pretend it doesn't exist or contain details of serious policies. You may disagree with them, but they exist.
@atticrahman "pseudo claim to care." Labour's plan is in its manifesto. If Dave is so much better than Ed, why is he afraid to  debate?
@atticrahman @David_Cameron @Ed_Miliband And after five years in power the Tories offer nothing but insults &amp; personal attacks.
@atticrahman And again with the belittling. It's incredibly arrogant &amp; off-putting.
@atticrahman If @David_Cameron says the choice is between him &amp; @Ed_Miliband should the public see them in a head to head debate?
@atticrahman Cameron was never "voted in" either. And that's in any case not how it works.
@atticrahman @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron Imagine your reaction if Brown had made that argument in 2010. You’d have been apoplectic.
@atticrahman @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron The boo-hoo emoji. Belittling your opponent while being too chicken to debate him one-on-one.
@RooftopJaxx Now it makes sense! Wales is following his leader’s example.
@atticrahman @Ed_Miliband @David_Cameron The nasty party. Arrogant &amp; dismissive.
@edvaizey @NewhamCons Having chickened out of the debate your party has no business commenting. Got something to say? Turn up &amp; debate.
@NewhamCons Milibrat? Oh dear. Five years in government &amp; that’s your campaign? The best you’ve got? Pathetic. Utterly pathetic.

@iainaitch @bernardtyers Arf!
Hey, @bernardtyers, there’s a Spanish anarchist version of WhatsApp 
@conormmcauley @iainaitch Came 4th, got 540 votes.
@NewhamGreens Plus, his participation would make Cameron’s absence look even odder. He’s enabling Dave (again!).
@NewhamGreens But doesn’t Clegg see himself (or want to be seen) as a challenger to the PM &amp; main party of government?
@RitsChadha Hope so. He deserves every bad thing coming to him.
@RitsChadha That, surely, is the risk he runs by not being there.
Why isn’t Clegg taking part in the #ChallengersDebate tonight?
@AlbertoNardelli BBC need to make it clear at the start that Cameron refused to take part in more than one debate. His absence is his fault.
Front page of The Sun this morning shows how utterly desperate the Tories &amp; their media lapdogs are. #GE2015
@CannHallERA Thanks. Maybe you could go round and tell them. Not somewhere they might think of themselves.
Anyone in #ForestGate who wants free tickets to #WHUFC better get in Cllr Rohima Rahman’s good books. If they can find her, of course…
So not at all open to abuse or being misused to reward loyalty to individual councillors #Newham
Community lead cllrs have “a central role in managing these rewards &amp; setting the criteria for distributing tickets to their residents.”
#Newham stadium loan deal incs 100,000 free WHU tickets a year “to reward residents for being active &amp; resilient members of the community”
@JackfromNewham £40m for stadium ‘transformation’ &amp; £5m for other ‘opportunities’ in the Park not directly related to the stadium.
@lexfri @reboundcast @dmoren @ttcashow @blurb That’s my homeward commute sorted then.
@sunny_hundal Labour has 13 years recent experience in govt. Doubt they’d be allowed to get away with relying on that to avoid specifics.
@JackofKent They need to ‘believe in Britain’ because they don’t actually know anything about it.

@carolinemeaby I don't know, but I'd guess either their lease is up or the rent has become unaffordable. Hopefully they'll find a new place.
@CMHarries @MrsForzagaribal Popped in on the way home. They say they are looking for new premises locally, so fingers crossed!
@fghays22 @StopCityAirport Bah! Need to register to get an estimate on that. I'll do it tomorrow.
@StopCityAirport Have been updating my estimate of the value of her portfolio. £3.8m so far, but can't find anything for 5a Hogarth Close.
@trm234567 How about just building &amp; maintaining a large stock of high quality, affordable social housing?
@StopCityAirport She says the flat opposite has been empty for 18 months. Genuinely baffled by this council &amp; its priorities.
@NewhamGreens <GREEN HEART>
Hashtag of the day award goes to #FiftyShadesOfGrayee (apologies to baffled non-Newham followers)
@drisc32 @dustydaz @grayee @LawMike @ViksE15 That hashtag actually made me laugh out loud!
#ForestGate institution the Siam Cafe is closing its doors on Saturday. Looking for new premises, but they may be gone for some time.
That line Labour use about Cameron - strong against the weak &amp; weak against the strong - applies equally to Sir Robin Wales. #Newham
Leaving aside how Sullivan &amp; Gold made their fortunes, that is just sick-making. #Newham
£40m loan under-written by some UK's poorest citizens to enable multimillionaire owners of West Ham Utd to relocate their club. #Newham
Council was told last September, "there remains a risk that the £40m loan will not be repaid." SRW gambling with our money? #Newham

Has anyone organised an all-party hustings in West Ham? #GE2015
@grayee @LawMike @NewhamGreens @Leisha007 @ViksE15 That’s a rhetorical question, btw, I really don’t care or need to know.
@grayee @LawMike @NewhamGreens @Leisha007 @ViksE15 No more (or less) anonymous than @newhamlabour or @WestHam_Ward. Who’s behind them?
@ViksE15 “He’s in the jailhouse now” 
@LawMike @David_Christie Or even those on average wages, given that they’ll be let at full market rents?

They should be as proud of it as Labour is of having created the…
@Rachel_shares Maybe. I haven’t tried yet though.
@CMHarries @e7_nowandthen What? Please tell me this isn’t happening.
The right-to-buy needs to be scrapped, not extended. Which party is promising to do this? #GE2015
@DerkHat Good luck!
@Saffronbread Meanwhile, in ‘Labour’ Newham: 
I wonder how many of @NewhamLabour’s buy-to-let landlord councillors are renting out ex-council properties? #Newham
I’ll be branded a Trot or a Tory apologist for my heresy, but how can any decent person vote for @NewhamLabour while that lot are in charge?
There are good people in @newhamlabour, but why do they let their leadership get away with stuff like this? Seriously, why? #Newham
Who is on the side of ordinary people in #Newham, @newhamlabour or @NewhamGreens? Read this before you answer: 
I want to take this and shove it in the smug faces of every #Newham councillor doing their campaign selfies. 
Re last RT: this is how #Newham "Labour" council deals with dissenters.
@philmonkey That's Newham Tories for you! Must be all those years beating their heads against an electoral brick wall.
@rectripp I do, I do! And sometimes I meet people read it - which is very gratifying.
.@NewhamCons prove they have a sense of humour by calling their election leaflet 'In Touch'. #GE2015
#WheresRobin? Too busy to go out &amp; campaign for Labour, but he found time to big himself up to CNN: 
Suspect this has less to do with them wanting me to read it &amp; more to do with incompetent distribution. Utter waste of money. #NewhamMag
I tweeted earlier that I put the #NewhamMag straight into recycling. Got home to find another copy on the mat. Now also in the recycling bin
@iainaitch @newhamlabour @FocusE15 Just when you think you might be able to bring yourself to vote Labour…
 
A poll showing a 6-point Tory lead today is no more credible than the one last week showing a 5-point Labour lead. #GE2015
@iainaitch Wonder how many people who turn up for a free CUP advice surgery end up as paying clients of Mr Malik’s ‘legal advice’ business?
@iainaitch Off their collective trollies. (And I’m fairly sure the legal imprint is wrong. Needs to have a name, not just an address).
@hangbitch @StopCityAirport He’s not to be seen in ANY of the many Labour doorstep selfies posted on Twitter. #WheresRobin?
@LawMike Mine went straight into the orange recycling bin. Which is more than it deserves. #Rubbish
East Ham Labour Party members campaigning for @wesstreeting in Ilford North. But #WheresRobin?  

All tax is annoying. 

Here are my top 6 reasons why inheritance tax is okay.

Spurs' failure to win yesterday was frustrating at the time, but doubly so now City are getting beaten. #COYS #THFC
@debi77 @kevpeel With any luck, they've had their chips.
Another bunch of @newhamlabour councillors out campaigning today for #GE2015, but #WheresRobin?

@Keralacommunity But #WheresRobin ?
@WestHamLabour @easthamlabour @wesstreeting @IlfordNorthCLP But #WheresRobin ?
@davemcauley On the bench yesterday. I don't think Mason has justified his selection in the past few games. #COYS
Hardly anyone pays #inheritancetax. In 2011/12, around 19,000 estates incurred the tax. That’s c.3% of all deaths.
Even Lester '3 jobs' Hudson found time in his busy schedule to go out on the doorstep. But the mayor is nowhere to be seen. #WheresRobin
All those campaign selfies featuring @newhamlabour councillors - I've still not spotted the mayor in any of them. #WheresRobin
@carotomes It appears to have all-party support down under. Maybe a consensus could be built here too.

@iainaitch You’ll be lucky. Lived through 5 general elections here &amp; been door-knocked exactly once. By the Tories. Campaign-free zone.
@fest4westham @samirjassal Floating voter.
@Margin4Error No, actually Harry Kane. He’ll reveal his identity after banging in the winner vs Cameron’s Aston Villa tomorrow.
@fest4westham I’d be more impressed if you and @samirjassal had been selected for Kensington &amp; Chelsea or Horsham
@fest4westham @SunNation And how many of this more diverse set of candidates have been selected for winnable seats? Again, less impressive.
@fest4westham @SunNation “Excluding those seeking re-election” - who are overwhelmingly white men. Not quite so impressive.
@ViksE15 @SparrowhawkSo It’s okay, we’ll try and keep them up our end of Forest Lane.
@juliannemarriot This is perfect 
@Mattsheffy @georgegalloway What about his deeply weird tweets about Louise Mensch?
Ashamed to say i’ve not been blocked by @georgegalloway.
@samirjassal @MailOnline Oh dear! Another utterly desperate attempt at a smear. Tory campaign now beyond the gutter &amp; in the sewers.
@adambro @markpack But not one in a local council by-election in #Newham. It costs nothing to stand &amp; they couldn’t manage it.
Your 2015 candidates: 
@hughbarnard @fghays22 Sat out the back in the garden.
@clooky Expect even wilder anti-Miliband headlines across the Tory papers tomorrow (&amp; every day until the election)
@clooky Like arrogant spoiled brats who believe they are entitled to win.
@LawMike The majority of other candidates have done that too.
@E7Drew @iainaitch The borough, not necessarily the ward. Though allegedly some Newham councillors don’t even meet that requirement.

@LawMike @jamogram @ViksE15 @StarLane_CT @ForestGreat @EllieCRobinson @SeyiAkiwowo I might just do that!
@LawMike @jamogram @ViksE15 @StarLane_CT @ForestGreat Not my experience, but yours may be different.
@jamogram @ViksE15 @StarLane_CT @ForestGreat Agree on that. FGN councillors use local shops/cafes/pubs &amp; are open to chats.
@ViksE15 @StarLane_CT @ForestGreat @jamogram Yes (though I’ve never had one - I happily eat meat) 
@StarLane_CT @ForestGreat @ViksE15 @jamogram Yes, we’re all beardy hipsters, sipping our lattes &amp; munching organic tofu burgers. FFS.
@jamogram @ViksE15 Map of where councillors live here: 
@jamogram @ViksE15 Yes. I used to live on Tower Hamlets Rd. A bit different to Capel Rd, but not another universe.
@jamogram @ViksE15 Sorry, forgot to paste in the link: 
@jamogram @ViksE15 Try this quiz out - just enter an FGN postcode (e.g. E7 9DA). You might find the answers surprising!
@ViksE15 @jamogram Maryland is in FGN ward &amp; cllrs have held street surgeries round your way. Small steps, maybe, but not invisible.
@jamogram @ViksE15 What do you attribute that to - more active cllrs, more vocal community?

@timrollpickerin Stratford bus station. So I can change onto the tube. Bus is better than unreliable Greater Anglia trains!
@lynbrownmp @EllieCRobinson Did TfL mention the improved 308 services at your meeting with them last month? Or is this their response?
On Saturdays, the first 308 services will start earlier; buses will now depart from Wanstead at 04:50 and Clapton at 05:19.
@timrollpickerin @TfL Sent to my personal email address - don't often get the chance to check it at work. Just got really means just read.
On weekdays, 308 buses will now run every 12 minutes, with the exception of between 07:00 and 09:00 when buses will run every 10 minutes.
New 308 timetable starts Saturday! #ForestGate
Just got an email from @TfL saying the 308 is going to run every 12 mins through the day &amp; every 10 mins in morning peak. #ForestGate

@NewhamGreens @Rachel_shares @lynbrownmp Actually quite a lot of MPs seem to be doing it this time. They’ve obviously been told it’s okay.
@danielarider 2015 is the Year of Dan Being Right About the iPhone 6 Plus: 
@NewhamGreens @StopCityAirport She's not especially quick at updating the register, so she could have bought it a while ago.
@StopCityAirport Zoopla says it was last sold in September 2001.
@IainDale No mention of Gerard Batten. Any reason, other than that he's a complete arse?
@StopCityAirport Where's the new one?
@carrieapples @timrollpickerin Which exactly proves Labour’s point: the rich are taking an ever-larger share of national wealth.
@Stefan4TottMP Yes, all is well. I salute your indefatigability! 20 minutes on my blog is above &amp; beyond the call of duty.
@60Sparkle If he's elected mayor he'll presumably resign his seat &amp; there will be a by-election. Not counting his chickens just yet!
Last year's Tory candidate for #Newham mayor is standing in Tottenham against David Lammy. Another brave but doomed campaign.
@Stefan4TottMP @NewhamCons Oh, that's where you've gone! Was wondering what had happened to you after last May.
Tory candidate @fest4westham is right about @newhamlabour, but electing his party to government won't help #Newham 
@adampowley Thought he &amp; Vertonghen made a good pairing, especially against long ball teams. Dier probably better versus pace.
@adampowley Injured or not Fazio hasn't been considered since our Europa League exit.
Not sure what Paulinho did to merit a full 90 minutes there. Anonymous. #THFC #COYS
@adampowley Not helped by Pochettino's refusal to even consider Fazio, Capoue and Kaboul.
@BenPearceSpurs Not at all sure he was playing! #THFC
No Lloris or Vertonghen so Kane captains Spurs. Would have thought Walker a more obvious choice, but I don't suppose it matters #COYS #THFC
It is Cameron, not Miliband, who will bring chaos if he wins the election, says @NickCohen4

@ViksE15 Which half do you put me in?
@AnthonyAshton1 Win tomorrow &amp; we're 5th, but no real prospect of going higher.
@AnthonyAshton1 Bollocks, hadn't thought of that. 8th is probably beyond us. Another season of Thursday/Sunday football beckons.
Looks like Spurs, Liverpool &amp; Saints are in a 3-way battle for 7th  and the prize of not competing in next season's Europa League #COYS
It all looks very fishy to me. This has someone's fingerprints all over it - but who's?
Thursday Sturgeon wins the debate &amp; Miliband outperforms Cameron. Friday a Tory paper gets that leaked memo. Saturday it's the main story.
@carolinemeaby @_emilyoram @guardianweekend Not pairing @stellacreasy with The Mogg was a missed opportunity. But otherwise excellent stuff.
Ironic #Newham councillor tweet or coded dissent from mayoral priorities?
@philmonkey I do Storify then post a link on Wordpress. Embed would be better, but it works.
@philmonkey But not easy to then embed into a Wordpress blog, unfortunately. Otherwise absolutely perfect.
@grayee If Cameron ends up back in No.10 it won't be because I voted Green (or Labour, or not at all - all still possibilities).
@grayee As West Ham is a safe seat you have the luxury of not campaigning for my vote &amp; I have the luxury of using it as I please.
@grayee @NewhamGreens @damnably I suspect that's their plan!
@NewhamGreens @grayee Substitute 'inept labour council' with 'malicious, scheming &amp; self-interested Labour leadership' and you have it right
@LawMike @newhamlabour I'm an incorrigible optimist!
@Mairead66 @ViksE15 @NewhamGreens @grayee In London (inc. #Newham) 'affordable' officially means 80% of market rent.   Which is nonsense.
I wrote this last year. Judging by recent events, I'd say @newhamlabour is now well into stage 4. 
@NewhamGreens @damnably @grayee Some things I wrote about this last year: 
@NewhamGreens @damnably @grayee I couldn't agree more. We need PR for local government.
@NewhamGreens @damnably @grayee Individual backbench councillors have limited influence in our mayoral system. Policy comes from the top.
@NewhamGreens @damnably He did so in the face of considerable pressure from whips not to.
@NewhamGreens @damnably In fact @grayee was one of only two councillors to visit Carpenters occupation &amp; has publicly questioned the mayor.
@grayee Not everyone who doesn't vote Labour is a Tory. The world is not binary.
@grayee No-one in this conversation has anything other than contempt for this government. No-one wants to excuse it. We all want it gone.
@grayee And you're trying to excuse Labour of all responsibility for what happens in Newham because we've had a Tory government for 5 years.
@grayee The point was specifically about Newham, where Labour has been eternally in unchallenged power.
Between Miliband and Cameron, Miliband won for me. But both outshone by Sturgeon. #LeadersDebate
Post debate spin coverage is pointless - all parties saying their leader was clear winner. #leadersdebate
Strong closing statement from Natalie Bennett. Vote for what you believe in, not the lesser of two evils. #leadersdebate
Audience claps Miliband saying Tories wanted less bank regulation: shows public no longer buying Tory claims about  who crashed the economy.
@CareersDefender argh!
Farage being more openly and aggressively racist than usual. Panic is the face of sliding poll ratings? #leadersdebate
@DerkHat I'm going Welsh so I can vote for Leanne.
@GMillerTN23 Which is what Natalie Bennett said. We should increase the aid budget.
Nicola Sturgeon rejects whole premise of deficit reduction through cuts. Advocates more spending. Bravo! #LeaderDebate
Yesterday our children were being brainwashed by EU colouring books, now this. #UKIP are imploding 
@emmahoneybone @susie_dent Plenty of those round our way!
@grayee Not my colleagues - I'm not a member. But I thought they were making a reasonable point about inequality &amp; deprivation in Newham.
@fghays22 @lukeakehurst @RooftopJaxx Happily for @grayee, @newhamlabour is a broad &amp; forgiving church.
@RooftopJaxx @lukeakehurst it was indeed @grayee &amp; I think I may also once have been similarly branded.
@forzagaribaldi Cllr John Gray.
I’m lost for words. Just seen local #Newham councillor call Greens ‘Tories on bikes’ and ‘Tory excusers’. A real #headdesk moment.

@Eat16Cafe That would make her position on the council 'interesting', to say the least!
@emmahudds @iainaitch But the other seven… not so much. Except why campaign here when the result is a foregone conclusion?
@StarLane_CT …and one in a company name - All Seasons Management &amp; Lettings.
@StarLane_CT Wasn't checking for that; just seeing if they were licensed &amp; who too. Most in her husband's name, 1 in her son's (I think)…
@emmahudds @iainaitch The candidate they are campaigning for is Ellie Robinson's husband.
@StarLane_CT She lives in one &amp; rents out 16. Two of them don't appear to be licensed, according to Newham's online records.
@Khyberman The Labour badge is pretty meaningless in Newham. Just look at our mayor.
@NewhamLondon So I assume you'll be taking enforcement action immediately.
@NewhamLondon 96a Plashet Close &amp; 95 Lonsdale Ave aren't, but Cllr Chowdhury says she rents them out (check her register of interests).
That's just the property Cllr Chowdhury's obliged to declare in #Newham. She may own stuff elsewhere too.
Rough estimated value of Cllr Chowdhury's portfolio (using Zoopla) is £3 million, with c.£15,000 a month in rental income. Tidy. #Newham
Here's Cllr Chowdhury's register of interests. 17 properties, 16 of them rented out: 
96a Plashet Close &amp; 95 Lonsdale Ave don't have private landlord licenses, but Cllr Chowdhury declares she derives income from them. Naughty.
Two properties owned by Cllr Ayesha Chowdhury that she declares she gets rent from aren't licenced, according to #Newham council's database.

#Newham councillors photographed y'day campaigning in Scotland, Ilford &amp; Stratford. But no sign of the mayor. Is it all a bit beneath him?
@AbdulHai23 @Glo_Thienel @StopCityAirport No need in Newham, both seats are super-safe. Some councillors were out in Ilford North too.
@Eat16Cafe @SparrowhawkSo Yep. Presumably @CharleneMcLean_ either doesn't want or doesn't need his help in Stratford &amp; Newtown.
This is what happens when the electoral system is broken. Voters in safe seats ignored &amp; taken for granted.
Not that I blame them. Why waste time canvassing in East &amp; West Ham when you're guaranteed to win them? Put your effort where it counts.
Eight (count them!) #Newham councillors out canvassing for the general election. In Scotland.

Comment on BBC website: “I am a big fan of Top Gear, it is about the only programme on BBC1 that is worth watching.” It’s on BBC2.
@marcoarment If Clarkson is a true friend to Hammond &amp; May he’ll urge them to carry on. No point in them throwing their careers away too.
@alister_b Right up your alley then ;-)
@alister_b  Just …FYI 
@jamogram That’s how it reads to me, though how they can call off from the framework but not spend any money I’m not sure.
@jamogram Maybe, but surely some training is better than none, especially if cost is met externally. I don’t understand this decision at all
@jamogram See item 4 &amp; mayor’s decision. Cost would be £290k over 2 years &amp; fully funded by TfL: 
Hugely disappointing that the iconic Balfron Tower is being sold to be turned into luxury flats

End of @conormmcauley’s evidence. Two of mayor’s SpAds promptly leave to report back to the boss. #NewhamOSC
Inconceivable that between Feb 13 &amp; July 14 mayor did not ask for a progress update or how spend was going on EHTHC project #NewhamOSC
Chair warns against speculative evidence. #NewhamOSC
It is inconceivable that there was no member oversight. Boom! #NewhamOSC

Our next witness is Cllr @conormmcauley. @diannewalls8 excuses herself from active participation. #NewhamOSC
Resuming now. @kayscoresby wants public to understand Mayor should not be dictating how scrutiny works, #NewhamOSC
Mayor has now left with his party. Comfort break. #NewhamOSC
Mayor repeats stuff about high quality building &amp; excellent new 6th form college. Mistakes were made but … bygones #NewhamOSC
Sir Robin calls time on questions so he can read a prepared statement. Committee allows him to do it. Obviously pre-agreed #NewhamOSC
Kim BD explaining how delegated authority works. This appears to be news to some present. #NewhamOSC
In July 2014 it was noticed that commitments had exceeded the budgets. But did not know by how much until September #NewhamOSC
Kim BD says contractors only did what they were asked to do by the project manager. #NewhamOSC
Mayor cautions against rash allegations without evidence. #NewhamOSC
Deborah Hindson says audit review has found no evidence of fraud. #NewhamOSC
Now @kayscoresby asks a question @grayee tabled. Can we be sure no fraud by contractors? #NewhamOSC
Follow-up: so on EHTC all that protocol went out of the window? Lengthy answer boils down to yes, because officers failed. #NewhamOSC
. @rokhsanafiaz asks about other major projects. Lester Hudson is reading a prepared answer he obviously didn’t write #NewhamOSC
Expected processes were not followed. Systems in place but weren’t used. Data not input so issues weren’t flagged #NewhamOSC
Winston Vaughan asks about financial tracking. What systems were in place? #NewhamOSC
Problem is the contract was varied to extend the scope without proper authority #NewhamOSC
Ahmed Noor asks director of finance a question about procurement process. She says was followed correctly #NewhamOSC
Mayor gets shirty with @kayscoresby saying she doesn’t understand how the council works. #NewhamOSC
3 Jobs responds saying it was a different kind of thing. #NewhamOSC
Asks about programme board for community hubs. It was chaired by mayor &amp; Cllr Hudson was on it. Why change from that model? #NewhamOSC
Now @kayscoresby. Wants straight yes or no answers from Lester Hudson &amp; Mayor. #NewhamOSC
Mayor insists no member knew what was going on. #NewhamOSC
Kim BD says it was an officer-only board. No member involvement. Mayor nods vigorously #NewhamOSC
Sounds to me like council’s project management was very haphazard, with poor systems in place &amp; lack of rigour #NewhamOSC
Kim BD says everyone thought the project was on track when responsibility moved between directorates. That was incorrect #NewhamOSC
Now @NewhamSue asking about lack of continuity in governance of the project. Kim BD agrees it was not normal practice #NewhamOSC
Late arrival as @grayee joins the committee #NewhamOSC
Mayor again repeats that the officers concerned have left the authority. As if that’s the end of the matter. #NewhamOSC
There are elected members on Atherton programme board, why not on this project? #NewhamOSC
. @diannewalls8 asks why members didn’t ask why finance wasn’t being discussed. Mayor says it was an officers cttee, no members #NewhamOSC
Mayor has jumped in to repeat that officers not telling executive anything is the root of the problem #NewhamOSC
Kim BD says he will send list of members to the cttee. Insists there are no records of meetings. General disbelief. #NewhamOSC
Kim BD names exec director of ops &amp; resources as chair of programme board. Says he decided membership. Doesn’t know who was on it #NewhamOSC
. @diannewalls8 asks Kim BD who established management board &amp; why no reports to cabinet. Asks for membership, agendas, minutes #NewhamOSC
Mayor asked why he hasn’t answered written qs from @diannewalls8 as agreed. Apologises for misunderstanding. Says he will. #NewhamOSC
Chair proposes a site meeting at East Ham Town Hall campus ahead of the next meeting #NewhamOSC
Kim Bromley-Derry, the mayor, Lester Hudson &amp; Deborah Hindson (director of finance) are our witnesses at #NewhamOSC. Meeting underway.
Waiting to go into #NewhamOSC. Will try to live tweet as much as possible.
Q9 for #NewhamOSC: why has a resident’s FOI request on this matter (ref E21163) not been answered, despite being 3 months overdue?
Q8 for #NewhamOSC: if yes, will the Mayor agree to waive them so that the officers can be witnesses at the next meeting?
Q7 for #NewhamOSC: Were the departures of 3 senior officers covered by compromise agreements that would prevent them talking to Scrutiny?
Q6 for #NewhamOSC: Can Scrutiny be provided copies of leading counsels’ opinions on the likely legality of Newham 6th form Collegiate?
Q5 for #NewhamOSC: if he wasn’t a member, did the mayor ever attend meetings of the EHTHC/6th form programme board?
Q4 for #NewhamOSC: Who sat on the EHTHC/Newham 6th form collegiate programme board? A full list of names please.
Q3 for #NewhamOSC: Which mayoral advisor’s portfolio included oversight of the
EHTHC project prior to the election in May 2014?
Q2 for #NewhamOSC: Which mayoral advisor’s portfolio currently includes oversight
of the EHTHC project?
Q1 for #NewhamOSC tonight: as cabinet lead for finance &amp; chair of the audit board, why did Lester Hudson not spot the £10m overspend?
@NewhamLondon Thanks
Star-studded line-up for #NewhamOSC tonight: council’s CEO; Lester ‘3 jobs’ Hudson; the chief financial officer; &amp; the Dear Leader himself.
Correction: Round 2 of #NewhamOSC investigation into East Ham Town Hall &amp; 6th form collegiate fiascos is at 6:30pm tonight, Stratford TH.
@jamogram Yes, you’re right. And thanks - I would have been late!
@NewhamLondon Is there publicly accessible wifi at Stratford Town Hall?
I’ll wager a small sum that FOI doesn’t get answered this side of the election. #Newham
Worth keeping an eye on: FOI on #Newham council contracts (including living wage and zero hours): 
Round 2 of #NewhamOSC investigation into East Ham Town Hall &amp; 6th form collegiate fiascos. 7pm tonight at Stratford Town Hall.
@NewhamGreens Response from Lab cllrs is always ‘it’s complicated.’ But not too complicated for other London councils. Or Boris’s GLA!
Sir Robin says #paybytherrules but #Newham council is still not an accredited Living Wage employer 
Ironic sloganeering by a mayor who employs hundreds of staff on zero hours contracts #Newham 
@emmahoneybone @billjames It’s never got me anything other than a mountain of unwanted notification emails.
@rokhsanafiaz Congratulations on your OBE! 
@billjames @emmahoneybone I loathe #LinkedIn with a passion. Spammy &amp; mostly pointless.
@jamogram @StopCityAirport That's beyond weird. What's the 'no BBQs' bit about?
@aalancraig Suspect that’s crossed with my reply. Thanks again.
@aalancraig Thanks. By ‘you’ in 2nd Q I meant UKIP rather than you personally (in case you misunderstood).
Amazing how our Labour mayor is so finely in tune with Tory policy, isn't it? #Newham
Re last RT, not a problem for #Newham as the mayor has already said Red Doors tenants will be allowed to buy.
Anyone know if, to the extent they actually exist, Newham Lib Dems have a Twitter account?
@aalancraig Two Qs: Does Newham UKIP have a Twitter account? Are you standing a candidate in the council by-election on May 7th? Thanks.
#AskUpgrade Have you made Jason eat Marmite yet?
@print_movement What happened to those ‘Robin is a Cock’ cards? (I may have mis-remembered the actual wording &amp; substituted my own there!)
New blog post: Maternity blues - calling bullshit on claims of mayoral ignorance 
@davemcauley That seems to be Bentaleb's job. And he's doing pretty well at it.
@davemcauley Bale. Eriksen does Modric's job. Neither Townsend nor Lamela does Bale's.
@Pam_nAshes ¡Força Barça! #ElClasico
@emmahoneybone Watch it? Surely you live it #countryfile
@khalillaher ¡Força Barça! #ElClasico
Wayne Rooney’s no Harry Kane #LFCvsMUFC
Look at the table &amp; note the asterisk by @CharleneMcLean_'s name. 'Currently on maternity leave'. #Newham 
@LawMike @SparrowhawkSo I think that as Wales is executive mayor *he* is the authority. It's up to him, not council.
@Eat16Cafe @SparrowhawkSo Exactly. There are big problems inside Labour group. This was allowed to happen.
@SparrowhawkSo There's no doubt some deep &amp; dirty politics going on inside the local Labour Party.
@SparrowhawkSo Councillors aren't employees but you'd expect her to be given permission to stay away &amp; care for her child regardless.
@transformUK *ahem* football results
If Farah Nazeer was on maternity leave, why wasn’t Charlene McLean? #Newham 
Councillor casework log proves @CharleneMcLean_  WAS on maternity leave: 
@LawMike Boom!
@LawMike @SparrowhawkSo Or a plank of wood. They’ve actually tried that and it worked ;-)
Looks like #UKIP aren’t quite the ‘change from politics as usual’ they make themselves out to be: 
@StopCityAirport Several thousands of pounds, I shouldn’t wonder.
@LawMike @NewhamRecorder Guess so, but I have a paper copy. It’s on page 6.
@LawMike @NewhamRecorder Or they could use the Standard’s report, which is pretty biting. “Councillor ‘dumped’… after premature birth”
New blog post: The Casual Vacancy 
@Russellsparadox @wesstreeting @newhamlabour From your tweet to God’s ears! #COYS
Biggest loser in Stratford by-election will be @wesstreeting's hopes of winning Ilford North. Has @newhamlabour engineered a #ToryHold?
@LawMike Yes, I think they are making their feelings known!
Stratford &amp; New Town by-election within 35 days. General election in 49 days. Top planning by @newhamlabour there!
Casual vacancy: 
@diannewalls8 Have updated my blog post with this.
I'm supporting 
@peterwalker99 And apparently sticking two fingers up at voters.
“I didn’t leave the Labour party – it left me” Worth a read &amp; also the whiny comments from offended Labourites. 
#Newham refuse an FOI request for an updated FOI disclosure log - not updated since July 2014: 
@StopCityAirport that’s so meta!
New blog post: Sir Robin talks about immigration, diversity &amp; cuts on LBC. Listen to what he had to say. 
English Premier League has matched its Scottish counterparts - no clubs left in #ChampionsLeague.
So much for Sky's 'Best League in the World' - not a single club into #ChampionsLeague quarter finals. Weak French Ligue 1 has two.
@fest4westham @jamogram I’m being generous. Hit that &amp; CCHQ should offer your pick of seats next time.
Budget 2015: Green Party reaction: 
“The Green Party is unashamed about its ambition to increase… govt spending &amp; taxation to help create a fairer, more sustainable society.”
@fest4westham Okay, just for laughs then - your predecessor got 14.7%; I predict you’ll match that (+/- 1%). (@jamogram)
@fest4westham @forzagaribaldi @jamogram Given what usually come through the door (Newham Mag) it was riveting stuff!
@fest4westham @jamogram BTW, last time I wagered on an election I ended up eating my hat, so my track record isn’t good.
@fest4westham @jamogram Not sure quite what I’ve misrepresented. But thanks anyway. Care to take a bet (a pint?) on your share of the vote?
@fest4westham  As I said before, good luck trying to sell the benefits of low-paid, insecure jobs to West Ham voters (@jamogram)
@fest4westham @jamogram See here re: people being pushed into self-employment: 
@fest4westham @jamogram Nothing wrong with self employment - I did it for a while. But lots of people being pushed into it, like it or not.
@fest4westham @jamogram Self employment is counted as full-time, so that accounts for about 50% of the rise.
@fest4westham @jamogram Jobs &amp; business. Jobs &amp; business. What about PEOPLE? And culture and enjoyment? And the environment? #despair
@fest4westham @jamogram Zero hours contracts, forced Workfare and fragile self-employment. That’s the reality behind Osborne’s spin.
@Khyberman Infrequently. Have stopped buying daily papers.
@iainaitch This thing writes itself!
@Khyberman Even that noted left-winger Michael Portillo described her piece as ‘vicious’. Anyway, read the Eye piece if you haven’t already.
@NewhamSue @NewhamRecorder When is Vicarage Lane closing? Need to go there for a blood test!
@iainaitch “My Financial Advisor Next Door”
@Khyberman As is the hypocrisy of writing snide articles in the press about other people’s arrangements after you’ve benefitted from it.
@Khyberman That’s a different argument (and I broadly agree with you). But mis-using the system to enrich yourself is inexcusable.
@fest4westham People would rather be paid a living wage &amp; pay their own way than work for peanuts &amp; rely on benefits to make ends meet.
@Khyberman You’re seriously justifying an MP using the expenses system for personal gain?
@Khyberman Both of which he paid for himself. Unlike Mr Gove (see Private Eye for details) #hypocrisy
@fest4westham No. The living wage is not pointless. It takes people out of poverty &amp; reduces the welfare bill. Everyone wins.
@fest4westham Really? You don’t know me at all, do you? ;-)
@fest4westham And you think taxpayers should continue to subsidise cheapskate employers through in-work benefits?
@fest4westham So your position is that the poor don’t need higher wages? Good luck selling that to West Ham voters.
@markmalone91 @BenPearceSpurs And a major final. Thrashed Chelsea &amp; beat the Arse in the league. Hope we still have legs for the run-in.
@markmalone91 @BenPearceSpurs @NickySlade @David_Lee91 But do wholesale changes every summer help us? No evidence for that lately.
@robgawthorp Data is from HMRC, so I’d be wary of dismissing it out of hand.
@SALiddy That’s £31,865 of taxable income. Add on the tax free allowance &amp; it’s c.£42k. Average wage is c.£28k. 
@robgawthorp You’re right - it’s only 14.7% pay the higher rate: 
@iainaitch Good day to be a software developer looking for government contract work.
@fest4westham Makes no difference at all to those on less than £12.5k. Mandating &amp; enforcing a living wage would. #Budget2015
Only in Daily Mail-land are 40% taxpayers ‘middle-earners’. Reality is they’re the top 15%. #Budget15
@NickySlade @BenPearceSpurs @David_Lee91 No, no, no! Need a settled squad, not dozens of ins-and-outs every summer. A few choice signings.
@fest4westham Okay, I refuse to take anyone seriously who claims the BBC is biased against the Tories.
@fest4westham No. But you &amp; your party have the overwhelming benefit of the current arrangements, so it ill behoves you to complain.
@fest4westham Also a bit rich for a Tory to be complaining about lack of neutrality &amp; balance in the press!
@fest4westham Ha ha, very funny Festus! @NewhamRecorder knows which side its bread is buttered.
@ruskin147 @DaveLeeBBC Congrats! Are you relocating to cover your new beat?
@itvlondon @iainaitch Also ask Boris about rationale for rent reductions if WHUFC are relegated from Premier League.
@LawMike @starjumpARTS Basic allowance is going up on 1 April to £10,937. No change to SRAs though.
@nicktheowl What do we want? STV in multi-member constituencies! When do we want it? Now! #unlikelychant
@marcoarment Good luck with that! 
@nicktheowl Which is exactly why the Tories &amp; their mates in the media spent so much time traducing him. And why Cameron won’t debate him.
@nicktheowl And I want my vote to count. I live in a super-safe seat, so it really makes no odds who I vote for.
@nicktheowl Agree absolutely. And I’m sick of it. I want to vote positively, not for the least-worst alternative to the Tories.
@ianpocock @RobSellers @gregholt Far more so than his manager.
@nicktheowl Labour aren’t *entitled* to the progressive vote &amp; their endless whining about consequences of voting Green pisses me off.
@nicktheowl Renationalise the railways? Half a million social rented homes by 2020? Free university tuition? No NHS privatisation?
@Markfergusonuk @MsJackMonroe @pollytoynbee You want Green votes for Labour? Give us some policies worth voting for.
@stephenheppell @xeafra A shelf?
@MPSNewham Is this one insured? Hasn't moved since October. You'll find it on Capel Road. 
@StopCityAirport Such deals are not for the likes of us!
Our community lead councillor is on Health Scrutiny but has attended just one meeting (of six) so far. We deserve better. #Newham
#Newham Health scrutiny Cttee will be talking about Whipps X tonight. Will Forest Gate’s invisible ‘community lead councillor’ turn up?
@patrick_breen guessing between 0800 and 0815 based on a couple of tweets about it.
@rectripp Have spent a lot of time at Whipps lately (wider family, not me) so the report is no great surprise. Inpatient care was very poor.
@rectripp Luckily Maternity services not quite as awful as the rest of the hospital!
@rectripp You’re on Health &amp; SC scrutiny commission aren’t you? Assume you’ve seen CQC report on Whipps X. Used by many FG residents.
@e7_nowandthen @LawMike You’re only counting her SRA. Add in the basic &amp; see what you get!
@fussellface …and can’t delete.
@patrick_breen I’m unlikely to get joy anywhere else. Any chance you could find the clip and send it to me?
@NewhamSue Our community lead councillor is Rohima Rahman, not @diannewalls8, more’s the pity.
@NewhamSue Forest Gate’s lead community cllr is on the health scrutiny commission. This is something she should be taking up on our behalf.
Anyone have a recording of Sir Robin Wales on @NickFerrariLBC this morning? No free ‘listen again’ option.
@NewhamSue Although the report doesn’t mention #Newham as part of the ‘context’ it is the local hospital for those of us in the north.
@StopCityAirport But rent is reduced if they get relegated.
@LawMike @e7_nowandthen Not exactly busting abut, is she? #MoneyForNothing
@fest4westham @LBC As far as I can see you have to pay to listen again. Oh well…
New blog post: Inadequate - CQC blasts quality of care at Whipps X Hospital 
@fest4westham @LBC Thanks, I’ll try and find it later.
@fest4westham Where was this? Do you have a link?
Damning report of quality of services at Whipps X Hospital. CQC rates it as inadequate 
@andyburnhammp Please post a link if you have one. Whipps is our local hospital.
@fest4westham Can you point me at said rant? What did he say?
@AnthonyAshton1 But it’s never really been celebrated, even before that was something people worried about.
@AnthonyAshton1 We don’t like to make a fuss.
@philmonkey @DartCharge #facepalm
@DartCharge @philmonkey It’s ‘one-off’ not ‘once-off’.
@NewhamLondon What special events are planned to mark #20GloriousYears of Sir Robin’s rule in the borough?
Still don’t know the exact day Sir Robin ascended to power in 1995. Guess I’ll just have to watch out for the bunting. #20GloriousYears
@hughbarnard Another triumph for the Dear Leader. Doubt this one will get a double page spread in the Mag! #20GloriousYears
Miliband rules out SNP coalition, as Tories demand. Will they now rule out Farage’s proposed UKIP/DUP/Con alliance?
@IainDale But then I’d miss all the general election predictions fun!
@IainDale Isn’t there a Biteback Twitter account you can use to endlessly promote @Nigel_Farage, instead of polluting your own?
@carriefade @ForestGreat Try @Greenworks10 
Farage’s proposed referendum question: “Do you wish to be a free, independent sovereign democracy?” What a cock. #UKIP
@RitsChadha @jamogram Rumour a year or so ago was that this person thinks themselves a potential successor to Sir Robin.
@SuzHu @ipswichorient I know @Invitetosupper isn’t a fan but we use Dennis in Wanstead. Always been very happy with the quality.
Sorry to say I agree with @iaindale. These are vacuous generalities, not pledges. Disappointing. 
@copwatcher #OlympicLegacy
Cover of the latest #NewhamMag features @MPSNewham. Oh no, wait a minute, it doesn’t… 

I'm with Gordon! 
@marcoarment Can’t AT&amp;T customers use @ThreeUK with no roaming charges in the UK? Works the other way round for us. #FeelAtHome
@LawMike She's a member of the Oversight &amp; Scrutiny Committee.
#Newham Council snoops on more private emails than MI6 - 
@jsnell @ullconf @jamesthomson Is @gruber’s after-dinner speaking slot still open? @siracusa would be the perfect replacement!
@caseyliss That was rage? You really are the most mild-mannered man on the Internet.
@MazzardFarm @ClaireWrightInd No, I didn’t. Good luck to her.
@MazzardFarm Of interest? 
Blue Labour returns... In #Newham it never went away 
@emmahoneybone @JonAkwue Maybe some people aren’t quite as stupid as this implies. Just expect a bit too much of their software.
@emmahoneybone @JonAkwue Does this include people who type Google in browser (no .com/.co.uk) and it sends it to Google as a search term?
@jojomoyes @VagendaMagazine @Marthalanefox Oh, you do. You’re just far too polite to say them out loud.
@Gian_TCatt @StopCityAirport Council tax receipts are c.£63.5m, so a third of that going out in bank interest! Bloody hell.
Kane-esque! #CHEPSG #ChampionsLeague
Hopefully PSG can do what Schalke couldn't quite manage yesterday. #ChampionsLeague
#Newham Council has foregone £9.25m in rent &amp; council tax due to keeping properties on the Carpenters Estate empty 
@carrieapples @Khyberman Cameron &amp; Crosby are playing a very dangerous game.
@carrieapples @Khyberman Stirring up anti-Scottish sentiment amongst the English will do more damage to the Union than any SNP/Lab coalition
Mayor says £5m spent on Upton Centre means cuts elsewhere. So what about £10m overspent on East Ham Town Hall? 
@adampowley Rarely if ever. Brouhaha is more my kind of word.
I’d rather the mayor did the honest thing and put up council tax. #Newham
Re previous RT: this is one way #Newham funds its council tax freeze - overzealous imposition of fines &amp; charges.
@aalancraig You are bang on about the Tories. But what would UKIP do to reduce inequality &amp; improve social justice?
@GaryLineker If they don't want him we'll have him back. #THFC
Well, Real Madrid v Schalke is turning out to be quite the game. #ChampionsLeague
@brionygunstone @NatMurray38 @EllieCRobinson Or more double-deckers during morning peak. There are a couple but timings seem random.

@RitsChadha If you’re a member of Stratford ward you should *definitely* go along to the AGM &gt;&gt; 
Does anyone know the exact date in 1995 that Robin Wales became leader of the council? #Newham #rejoice #DearLeader
I wonder what special events @NewhamLondon has planned to mark the 20th anniversary of Sir Robin’s ascension to power this summer. #Newham
@NewhamSue Also why it’s not a priority for Robin: wants headlines &amp; photo opps now, not in 20 years.
@jamogram @iainaitch Huge growth in private rented sector suits @NewhamLabour. Many councillors are landlords.
“The largest percentage point increase in poverty has been in #Newham, where almost one out of every two households is now poor.” #Legacy
This year marks Sir Robin’s 20th anniversary as our Dear Leader. He must be so proud of his achievements: 
@zoesqwilliams @ianpocock Excellent. And a good encapsulation of why the Greens are such a refreshing change from ‘politics as usual.’
@ianpocock @zoesqwilliams So why are UKIP obsessively covered by BBC/ITV/Sky/press and Greens aren’t?
@jsnell New MacBook specs say it has a ’FaceTime camera’; MacBook Air has a ‘FaceTime HD camera’. Odd downgrade for a new flagship product.
@robgawthorp Yep. And the replay goes to extra time.
@copwatcher @ClaptonFC_Match @Real_ClaptonFC The work of McBean’s two most recent signings, Copy and Paste?
@LawMike @e7_nowandthen From that description the job sounds exactly the same as a ward councillor. Where’s the extra £6k’s worth of work?
@EllieCRobinson @NewhamLondon @stephenctimms And to support them so they can *stay* in politics when personal circs make it difficult?
@MPSNewham Been sat outside my house for 4 months. Not moved. Taxed to 1/4/15. Has it been reported stolen? 
The utter desperation of the Tories in a single image. After 5 yrs in office, this is what they’re campaigning on: 
@Redpeter99 @nicktheowl Even worse, uses Tory scaremongering smear to frame the interview. BBC has given up any pretence of balance.
Actually turned radio off during @BBCr4today interview with @ChrisLeslieMP. Humphreys at his absolute worst. Disgraceful.
@Stratford_Ward Anything unexpected on the agenda?
Which is why I can't believe anyone in the Labour Party is seriously suggesting it.
A grand coalition with the Tories would be the end of the Labour Party. Look what's happening in Scotland after the joint No campaign.
@JoshFeldberg @amontoast @jogillette There’s a warren of little streets just off the Grand Place. Stuffed full of bars &amp; restaurants.

@clooky Garage sent me this to illustrate what had happened. New wheel &amp; cable mechanism: £400. 

#ForestGate advisor JD not publishe…
No idea when spare wheel was taken. Feel utterly depressed. What’s the fucking point?
Took the car in for service. Garage rang to say spare wheel has been stolen. Retaining cable cut through, so also needs replacing. FFS.

New blog post: FOI - a timeline 
@jamogram @emring_ @newhamcyclists Be worth talking to the people behind Hackney Citizen 
@fest4westham @LawMike But you’re not a citizen like any other: you’re a Tory PPC in an election that’s barely 2 months away.
@jamogram @emring_ @newhamcyclists I was being slightly facetious - but yes, a more positive title would be better.
@jamogram @emring_ @newhamcyclists We could do it online. Is ‘
@AirportWatch @StopCityAirport They were unequivocally against any increase in tuition fees. Until the Tories asked them to vote for one.
@fussellface @jamogram The lack of QA on FOI responses is shocking.
@LawMike Do you think we’ll ever get the chance to find out?
@fest4westham Don’t misunderstand me: I’m not in a hole right now.
@fest4westham When I’m in hole, I will.
@fest4westham And no, I wasn’t listening. I only know it happened because you tweeted about it.
@fest4westham No, but I am ‘amazed’ that of all the people wanting to question @MayorofLondon a Tory PPC took priority.
Clearly @LBC should adopt Fox News’ totally non-ironic slogan - ‘fair and balanced’.
Tory broadcaster @LBC puts Tory PPC @fest4westham through to Tory @MayorofLondon on phone-in to ask for support for his campaign. Shameless
@jamogram @James_Beckles @kayscoresby Why do I have the A-Team theme music in my head now? #DeltaOneEnforcementTeam

You can't buy happiness. But you can "bike" happiness. 
@NewhamGreens Is it members only, or can interested observers come along?
Given Sol Campbell’s history of ‘loyalty’ the Tories should watch out: he’ll himself get elected on their ticket &amp; defect to UKIP mid-term.
@krmansell As all OSC witness requests now go via SRW’s office this won’t be allowed to happen. We must draw our own conclusions from that!
@tomcopley And LAs get shafted because ‘discounts’ are funded by scrapping s106 payments &amp; the like.
@LawMike Both the slowness and the lack of quality assurance. How many FOI replies have they had to withdraw or revise because of errors?
@LawMike I submitted this one 3 months ago, still no answer: 
@robgawthorp After the past couple of weeks he needs to have a harder look at one or two.
Levy needs to get the fuck out of the way &amp; let the manager buy &amp; sell the players he needs to build his squad this summer. #THFC #COYS
Poch will learn a lot about his players in the coming weeks: who’s up for the fight &amp; who wants to hide. Big test of character. #THFC #COYS
Did Chadli need to concede that free kick when their player had nowhere to go? No. The kind of silly mistake we must cut out. #THFC #COYS
Townsend, Chadli &amp; Eriksen all below par today. Bentaleb again Spurs’ best player. Chelsea got the rub of the green &amp; made it count. #THFC
Almost there! #coys #thfc 
On our way! #SpursAtWembley #COYS #THFC
@GMillerTN23 @SparrowhawkSo Well there’s an offer! May take you up on it.
@GMillerTN23 @SparrowhawkSo But you’re never there! Always out on #LabourDooorstep in Thurrock.
@SparrowhawkSo Deutsche Bahn were looking at services to Frankfurt &amp; Cologne, but that's gone very quiet lately.

@BenPearceSpurs My XI: Lloris; Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Rose; Bentaleb, Mason; Dembele, Eriksen, Chadli; Kane #THFC #COYS
#SPURSATWEMBLEY
#THFC #COYS 
Robbie Savage escapes driving ban due to "abuse he’d get from public." So being a dick gives you a licence to speed? 
@adamcranfield Jubilee from Stratford - start of the line so we should get a seat. Unlikely going home after though (hopefully won't care!)
@adamcranfield Only in terms of what time we need to leave the house to get there in time. Hopefully no issues on the tube! #SpursAtWembley
Tomorrow! #SpursAtWembley
@ShabanMohammed Absolutely.
@ShabanMohammed Good luck with that!
@emmahoneybone @ianpocock Boom!
@ShabanMohammed I don’t think they’ll do that until they get more of the borough covered by RPZs. But it’s only a matter of time…
@ShabanMohammed @kayscoresby Easy-peasy! Just get yourself elected mayor and you can do it 10 times a season!
Wow! 
Crossrail is pulling into Forest Gate and Maryland: 
@NewhamSue @stephenctimms 13 years of Labour govt didn't change Newham from outer London to inner London funding. So not holding my breath.
@SpursFinest We just need to cut out the individual mistakes that cost us here. #THFC #COYS
@BenPearceSpurs Again, we go out to the 1st decent team we meet. 10 games to get there though. Ridiculously bloated competition.
On the bright side, if we beat Chelsea on Sunday we'll be back in this competition again next season. Oh…
@Eat16Cafe Fingers crossed #COYS
@Eat16Cafe Oh no! Have you called the club?
@iainaitch @copwatcher @E7Drew Yep. 
@StopCityAirport @iainaitch @lynbrownmp @fest4westham I thought @tamsinomond was standing in East Ham. Greens haven't selected West Ham yet.
@iainaitch @E7Drew Haven't they all joined UKIP?
@E7Drew @iainaitch He won’t lose his deposit, but he won’t get anywhere close to Lyn Brown. Tories got 15% last time. That’s his target.
@fest4westham Ahem. ‘Coalition’ government, surely?
@iainaitch @DerkHat He’s pro-affordable housing. And anti-parking charges.
@iainaitch He doesn’t live locally - moved away a few years ago. TR-P is his agent so probably using his address for legal reasons.
@iainaitch @DerkHat Probably shopkeepers in Canning Town. They’re upset a car park has been closed.
@iainaitch Hoping people don’t notice he’s a Tory is his best hope of getting people to vote for him.
@iainaitch Would you shout about it?
@imyke Just listened to episode 1 this morning. Excellent stuff. Now subscribed to Inquisitive.
Only four and a bit days to go! #SpursAtWembley
If you missed the live Twitter commentary from #NewhamOSC last night, I’ve Storified it right here: 
@JackfromNewham No, it wasn’t. And that is what counsel’s advice said. Even counsel hired specifically to find a way to do it!
@ColinAGrainger 162 of which are spam, no doubt!
Mayor leaves #NewhamOSC with @unmeshdesai in tow. Followed closely by Ken Clark. Thirsty work giving evidence. Now in need of refreshment.
Mayor now talking about Tory cuts. Need to focus on that. Diversion tactics. #NewhamOSC
Mayor says this is about people not doing their job properly. Assume he means Cllr Hudson &amp; himself. #NewhamOSC
Mayor says there will be new structures on council to try and make sure this doesn’t happen again. But can’t guarantee it won’t. #NewhamOSC
#NewhamOSC should ask to see leading counsels’ opinions. There were several!
Mayor said legal advice said otherwise. But leading counsel later told officers it was illegal. They were ignored! #NewhamOSC
. @kayscoresby quotes director of children servs telling cabinet in Feb 13 that LA had no authority to open a 6th form centre #NewhamOSC
Cllrs Desai &amp; Clark have turned up to offer moral support #NewhamOSC
Mayor returns again to line that most important thing is providing high quality opportunities for our kids. #NewhamOSC
Question is surely how we can get councillors to do their job and provide proper governance &amp; oversight of major projects? #NewhamOSC
. @SeyiAkiwowo asks how we can be sure officers don’t usurp roles of councillors, which seems to have happened here. #NewhamOSC
.@berchinan asks for assurance future projects will be run by qualified people who ask the right questions. This needs saying? #NewhamOSC
#NewhamOSC need to push harder on lack of member participation in project governance. Who was cabinet lead responsible? Why so complacent?
#NewhamOSC haven’t really drawn from damning material in PwC report on governance failures.
SRW says new system of project management being put in place. Any evidence of wrongdoing should be referred to Chief Exec. #NewhamOSC
.@rokhsanafiaz asks about extra work given to contractors without proper procurement. Can legal action be taken to recover money? #NewhamOSC
@StopCityAirport Not even him.
Mayor says he could sit there and talk about his fantastic record. And promptly does. Claims he’s always been open. #Newham #scrutiny
. @NewhamSue asks how it is possible no word reached the mayor’s ears. #Newham #scrutiny
@StopCityAirport Apparently not their responsibility. Officers should have told them. Complete abdication of responsibility.
SRW now patronises @SeyiAkiwowo by saying she needs to read cabinet reports before asking questions #Newham #scrutiny
Mayor sticking to line that this is all officers’ fault &amp; they didn’t tell members. #Newham #scrutiny
Now @diannewalls8 gets to the nub: where was member oversight? Inconceivable that project this size went ahead without it. #Newham #scrutiny
OSC now tells mayor they expected other officers &amp; councillors they invited but he overrode them &amp; came instead. #Newham #scrutiny
Mayor gets hissy about answering questions from OSC members rather than written ones he’s prepared. #Newham #scrutiny
Now moving onto how 6th form will be ‘regularised’. No word on how it came to be irregular in the first place. #Newham #scrutiny
Statement so far is all ‘context’ and no content. Running down the clock. #Newham #scrutiny
At OSC on East Ham Town Hall &amp; 6th Form. Mayor reading a prepared statement. This may take a while. #Newham #scrutiny
@copwatcher Where have we heard this before? “£50 million to refurbish the Carpenters Estate.”
@fussellface A very expensive PR team!
@PrimlyStable You can adapt my Facepalm Sandwich if you like. 
Sir Robin Wales talks a good game over Boleyn housing plan. But talk is cheap. Bet you they get away with it. 
@KatyScholesSKY @IainDale But they have @SolManOfficial at the same price. Not sure which is more ridiculous.
@fghays22 That’s the link for the January meeting. Feb one says Stratford (though papers say East Ham)
Report from @EllieCRobinson on her &amp; @lynbrownmp’s meeting with @greateranglia on services through #ForestGate 
@EllieCRobinson @NatMurray38 @NewhamRecorder @lynbrownmp Thanks, that’s very helpful. Hope you get a good hearing from TfL as well.
@BenPearceSpurs @Ledleyandkings @TributeTrust “It’s lucky for Spurs when the chart position ends in 1” (or did I get that wrong?)
Sol Campbell is 33/1 with Ladbrokes to replace Sir Malcolm Rifkind as Tory candidate for Kensington &amp; Chelsea. They’re having a laugh!
@tomcopley Here you go: 
Labour’s hatred of the #GreenSurge is born of an outraged sense of entitlement: how dare they be challenged for the progressive vote!
@DaveHill Newham set its 2015/16 budget last night. Papers are on the website.
Having listened to the ‘Yesterday in Parliament’ segment of @BBCr4today I wonder why anyone ever votes for any of them. Beyond contempt.
@alexsmith1982 So Tories only call it a ‘culture of entitlement’ when it’s poor people relying on benefits?
@JackfromNewham Not much room for doubt if they'd seen the video.
Re last RT: not looking good for that professionally mediated meeting between the mayor &amp; the victims. #Newham
@JackfromNewham When did he do that? At council, or at Labour group?
@fghays22 @StopCityAirport @RitsChadha @GarfieldJudith Several councillors have said it's Stratford.
@StopCityAirport @RitsChadha @GarfieldJudith Venue has been switched. It's at Stratford, not East Ham. See you there? #scrutiny
@grayee I will be there.
@StopCityAirport Link: 
@StopCityAirport Yep. It's right there on the website.
@tomcopley Plus extra for chairing a select committee. He's on c.£81,000 a year for MP duties.
@Eat16Cafe Are you coming to Overview &amp; Scrutiny tomorrow evening?
@grayee Oh, and amazing how sometimes legal advice gets listened to, while at others it's ignored. 6th Form Collegiate for example.
@grayee Not sure being a councillor should be viewed as pensionable employment, but accept you have a different view. #PublicService
@grayee Publishing the Newham Mag fortnightly is unlawful, but hasn't stopped it happening!
@cottonbureau  I think the UK's national lottery operator might take a view on that! 
@grayee Any update on local pension plan for #Newham councillors?
Bravo to councillors @grayee, @rokhsanafiaz and Whitworth. Questions on pensions, LOBO loans &amp; Red Crate theatre project. #Newham
Judging by tweets from councillors the mayor's attempt to prevent public questions to the executive hasn't worked too well. #Newham
@SeyiAkiwowo I know I'll have company.
@SeyiAkiwowo I'll be at OSC tomorrow.
@SeyiAkiwowo Nice to see it's finished &amp; public can now see council in the flesh, not via closed circuit TV in another room.
New blog post: The job’s a joke - and the joke is on #Newham residents. 
Something you don’t see that often: a man in a bowler hat. And he is considerably younger than me.
Update: venue for tomorrow’s Overview &amp; Scrutiny meeting has been changed. Now Stratford town hall. #Newham
@diannewalls8 Thanks.
While @hkane28 is undoubtedly the star of this photo I’m in it too! #THFC #COYS 
Apple investing €1.7B in two new European data centres powered by renewable energy: 
@copwatcher I bumped into ex-Cllr Glynis Carpenter at hustings last year. Said she was secretary of @NewhamGreens.
Joy Laguda isn’t chair of Overview &amp; Scrutiny, so why is she signing this ‘call-in’ exemption? #Newham 
Overview &amp; Scrutiny meets tomorrow at 7 at EH Town Hall. To discuss £10m EH Town Hall overspend &amp; 6th form. Open to the public. #Newham
New blog post: Scrutiny. 
@JackfromNewham But he could do that in the normal Labour group meeting. So why there’s another meeting remains a mystery.
@JackfromNewham Maybe he wants to warn people not to ask questions or make comments when council is asked to note the decision.
@fghays22 Hadn't spotted that!
@StopCityAirport Don’t know.
OSC needs to focus not on officers but on elected members. Who knew what &amp; when? Is it credible mayor &amp; chums were kept in the dark? #Newham
PwC’s report ‘in the public interest’ would be a good place for OSC to start 
Overview &amp; Scrutiny meeting Tuesday at 7 to look at East Ham Town Hall &amp; 6th Form Collegiate mess 
Friend by name and friend by nature as far as Liverpool are concerned. Ref has been extremely lenient.
@iainaitch Ask @markpack. If anyone knows, he will.
@adamcranfield A few around us left before the end too. Never understood people who do that.
Sometimes Dembele is almost comically one-footed &amp; neither Lamela nor Townsend worth their place at Wembley on this showing. #THFC #COYS
Despite being well below par Spurs were worth at least a draw today. Nothing 'lucky' about it, Big Sam. #THFC #COYS
@JackfromNewham Do you know, by any chance?
@onasixpence Nice!
No place in the match day 18 for Capoue, Chiriches &amp; Adebayor. Again. #THFC #COYS
Mario’s Cafe absolutely rammed ahead of today’s game. Good to see. #THFC #COYS
@drhotspur ‘Billion Dollar Babies’ is my favourite.
@StopCityAirport @fest4westham @fghays22 Beat me to it. Tories aren’t absent, they’re in the council chamber pretending to be Labour.
@TimMinogue Newham’s basic allowance will rise 1% to £10,937 from 1 April. #priorities
Is Tory PPC @fest4westham to the left of the mayor on affordable housing &amp; s106 payments? 
@pollytoynbee Absolutely sick of this nonsense. Why do we have an electoral system that forces people to make these kinds of calculation?
@roblobue What was wrong with it before?
For a ‘non-racist party’, UKIP seems to attract a lot of support from racists. I can’t think why. 
@StopCityAirport And none in the proposed Morgan House/Stratford Mall redevelopment either 
@NatMurray38 @NewhamRecorder: @lynbrownmp &amp; Cllr @EllieCRobinson had a meeting with Greater Anglia about this a couple of weeks ago.
@newhamrecorder You should follow up on this: 
MT @jamogram: #Newham are breaking the best cycle path in the borough: 
Some Labour people might argue about a few of the red crosses. But the Greens are clearly going for the Left vote. 
@RichardJMurphy Does HMRC check that non-doms are paying tax in their 'home' country, or is that just taken on trust?
Here's the #FoI where that came from: Deductions from elected members' allowances 
ICYMI, between 2010 &amp; 2014 @newhamlabour councillors 'donated' £234,000 to the party via automatic deductions from their allowances. #Newham
@MacSparky Congratulations &amp; best wishes. I'm sure you'll make a huge success of it.
@Jags_Dave @IainDale IDS is the last person to be giving lectures on being an effective leader of the opposition.
Next week #Newham councillors will vote themselves a 1% pay rise, taking their Basic Allowance to £10,937 a year.
@newhamlondon The most recent #FOI disclosure log published on your website is for July 2014. A bit of catching up to do!
@RidingtheGoblin No, not all.
Between 2010 &amp; 2014 @newhamlabour councillors 'donated' £234,000 to the party via automatic deductions from their allowances. #Newham

@CareersDefender I note Robin is happy to work alongside Lutfur Rahman when it’s in his interests to do so.
@CareersDefender I saw much the same thing on the BBC news site. All about more power for Robin.
@iainaitch Almost makes fellow christianist-turned-kipper Alan Craig look sane.
MT @RidingtheGoblin: Some cheer 4 #goblin passengers! Meeting @lynbrownmp later to discuss overcrowding crisis &lt;&lt; hope it goes well
@clooky Their vision of the state is a machine that collects taxes from the poor &amp; hands the proceeds to the rich. Upwards redistribution.
No wonder most people think politics is a waste of time.
Growing inequality, tax dodging by the wealthy, the NHS, our schools, housing? No, what really matters is the colour of a fucking VAN.
@Khyberman Right, because the most important issue at this election is the colour of a fucking van. Jesus wept.
@GMillerTN23 @ChriswMP This isn't a story but@ according to Sky and the BBC, a pink bus is. FFS.
New blog post: Cheap shot. Tories auction West Ham treat, but how much is it really worth? 
@dansabbagh @AlbertoNardelli The key difference being that actors aren’t generally on a hundred grand a week.
@SparrowhawkSo Well obviously everyone with the same surname must be related!
@SparrowhawkSo Indeed. But our convenience comes a price to those who live much nearer the airport. Which is why a lot of people objected.
@DerkHat Surely the only way was up?
#Newham rails against the blight of high street bookies, but actively campaigned to bring London’s largest casino here. Idiocy now exposed.
Aspers Super Casino - “a violent crime ridden venue.” Mayor, who lobbied hard to have it in #Newham, remains silent 

@SparrowhawkSo Close enough to enjoy the benefits; far away enough not to suffer the consequences. Not sure everyone is quite so pleased.
I’m an Anti-Braker: 
@RidingtheGoblin Excellent. In Westminster, or locally?
@copwatcher Based on what Newham councillors declare in the register of interests that’s only worth £25.
Alarming new pictures emerge ahead of Dollar reunion tour 
@Redpeter99 @MikeGapes Jesus, Dollar haven’t aged well have they?
@markpack @trm234567 The election might as well not happen in Newham. In fact, from a campaign point of view, it won’t. Super-safe seats.
Great #Inquisitive episode with @macpowerusers co-host @KatieFloyd
@mylastsong Let’s hope!
@jamogram Argh! The more I listen the more infuriating I find it. Not my ward; it’s govt cuts; would you rather poor children starve? Jeez.
@mylastsong Oh goodness me, yes. Great performance. Totally outplayed them from first minute to last.
Cameron appointed Andy Coulson &amp; Lord Green to government. Serious errors of judgement. But ignore that: Ed Miliband looks a bit weird.
How badly distorted does the result of #GE2015 have to be for the political class to start taking electoral reform seriously?
@DerkHat Worked for me after I put my burglar alarm key fob through the washing machine.
“The neutrality of this article is disputed.” Large parts of Robin Wales page on Wikipedia “read as though written by a very keen supporter”
@Trunker159 And they're posted on the blog.
@Trunker159 Yes, I gathered that. Re-submit &amp; I'll publish.
.@Trunker159 If you want your comments published, re-submit them in your own name.
.@Trunker159 No I haven't. You've tried to post them in my name. Put them in yours &amp; I'll publish. As I told you yesterday.
In the slightly odd &amp; uncomfortable position of wanting West Ham to win.
@jakeyapp @Invitetosupper @AineCarlin Thanks, Jake.
@Trunker159 If you re-submit your comments on this &amp; the RPZ using your own name, not mine, I'll publish them.
Cracking atmosphere at the Lane, from the first minute to the last. Crowd 100% behind the team. Need more of that! #THFC #COYS
Arsenal looked, for the first time I can remember, like they didn't believe they were better than us. Played scared. #THFC #COYS
Wenger picked a team not to lose &amp; it didn't work. We outplayed them in every area of the pitch. A well-deserved win. #THFC #COYS
@Eat16Cafe Perhaps the mayor wants councillors to be better prepared next time he meets angry residents at the #Newham Show!
@EllieCRobinson @Ed_Miliband But you won’t hear any of that on the BBC. Too busy repeating lies from Tories &amp; tax dodgers.
I think we deserve better than our national public broadcaster acting as a megaphone for the Tories in the run-up to #GE2015

There's probably a perfectly good explanation for this 
@StopCityAirport @fghays22 @EastEndNewham @NewhamRecorder You just can’t get the staff these days!
@eddieplayfair If only trains ran from Stratford ‘International’ to Lille. You could do exchange day trips.
@BenPearceSpurs Poor deluded fool. AVB was told the same thing about Bale. Levy will sell anyone if the price is right.
@conormmcauley @GMillerTN23 Why should it? Because you want my vote. But our broken electoral system means you don’t really need it.
@conormmcauley @GMillerTN23 The result in West Ham is always a foregone conclusion that’s NEVER happened in a general election.
@conormmcauley @GMillerTN23 What I want is for my vote to matter enough that people actively campaign to try a win it.
@GMillerTN23 Given that @lynbrownmp will win by a massive margin anyway I’m not sure what the point of my voting is.
@GMillerTN23 As in 2005 &amp; 2010 I expect to have no conversations with anybody. If I’m lucky I’ll get a couple of leaflets through the door.
@JonPrynn But charitable donations are irrelevant to this story. Lots of people who earn far less than SRW give. It doesn’t make him special
@GMillerTN23 I fear that for those of us living in safe seats will be anything other than epic. We’ll barely know it’s happening.
@JonPrynn Did Newham PR contact you to add line about ‘mitigating circumstances’ &amp; Sir Robin making donations to charity?
@RitsChadha @LawMike Council PR team working overtime on damage limitation.
@RitsChadha @LawMike Evening Standard story now also includes that line, plus a bit about SRW donating part of his salary to charity.
@StopLCY The modern nature of @newhamlabour indeed: 
@copwatcher Wonder how the spokesperson knows about contents of the report ('mitigating circumstances') when it's supposed to be secret.
@NewhamRecorder Council spokesperson says investigator found mitigating circumstances. But the report is secret, so how do they know?
@jakeyapp Can you recommend any good vegan cookbooks? Focus on tasty food rather than health benefits. Asking for a friend (@Invitetosupper)

It seems porcine aviation is an actual thing. @NewhamRecorder reports on Standards Cttee verdict: 
@RooftopJaxx Well I never! Bravo, @NewhamRecorder!

@JonPrynn I see the copy has been updated, but the picture caption still says it’s a member of staff.
@StopLCY Check her register of interests on council website. Says where she lives.
Dear @BBCr4today, a rich person who hates paying tax telling us he doesn’t want to pay more tax isn’t news.
@paullewismoney @maryohara1 Not unnoticed by public. Obvious to many that number of rough sleepers has increased hugely in last 18 months.
@SeemaMariamEcho Hi Seema. You’be better off speaking to @StopCityAirport, @StopLCY or @HACANEast.
How many Royal Docks councillors were at the City Airport planning hearing? Perhaps they had better things to do. #Newham
Beckton cllr @ChowdhuryAyesha had better things to do last night than turn up for the City Airport planning hearing 
@David_Christie Given the council's record with private developers &amp; delivery of affordable housing, I'm not holding my breath.
@TheRealRevK @MarkGoodge @markpack Homeopathic democracy?
#Newham Council 'didn’t fully address Mr Burge’s queries and their tone was not appropriate,' says coroner.
Retired gardener takes his own life after council demand for repayment of benefits they overpaid: 
@StopCityAirport Ken Clark, paid by the mayor to be "the eyes and ears of the council, sharing information and local intelligence"
@StopCityAirport Deputy mayor, cabinet lead on finance, chair of the audit board AND in charge of strategic planning? Busy man. #4jobs
@SparrowhawkSo What's more baffling is that the Labour Party keeps reselecting him unopposed. Are they really so devoid of alternatives?
New blog post: Guilty! 
The Standard has reported the Standards Cttee verdict on Sir Robin’s conduct. Will @NewhamRecorder, I wonder? 
@JonPrynn Your picture caption is wrong. That’s not a member of staff but Cllr Obaid Khan, restraining Sir Robin Wales.
New blog post: scroungers! 
@davemcauley Me too. Sad day.
Oh God. @btsportfootball have hired Robbie Savage to do their #transferdeadlineday coverage. I’d rather poke myself repeatedly in the eye.

@LawMike Long time no hear!
Unbelievable chutzpah! 2-page article in #Newham Mag on 6th form college. No mention of it being opened illegally 
Committee has decided the mayor should have a professionally mediated meeting with his victims - bet that never happens! #Newham
It’s taken 6 months, but the standards cttee has decided shouting &amp; swearing at residents is not acceptable behaviour by the mayor #Newham
@copwatcher I might give it a go. Notwithstanding what the covering letter on the decision notice says, it has to be worth a try.
@aalancraig Watch the clip. The word ‘Christian’ is never spoken.
@aalancraig Er, aren't your God, Islam's Allah &amp; Judaism's Jehovah all the same thing?
@copwatcher Is it worth an FOI? They'll probably refuse but ICO might then force them to release it.
@copwatcher Have you been given a copy of the final report? I can't see anything yet on the council website.
Guilty! 
More bad news from Labour-in-name-only #Newham. 
@flicksandtricks As with Defoe last season? Unless there's another winger hiding in the development squad, of course!

@SeyiAkiwowo If you didn’t bother with mascara at all you could have an extra snooze every morning.
#BBC has given up all pretence of balance in political reporting. NHS coverage shows they’re just an extension of the Tory PR machine.
Up to half of ex-council properties sold under ‘right to buy’ are now in the hands of profiteering private landlords: 
@grayee Until 6th form position is 'regularised' it is operating at risk. Staff &amp; students are at risk, through no fault of their own.
@grayee Also, what about safeguarding staff? They took jobs in good faith, but employment now at risk as salaries etc are ultra vires.
@grayee You'll be fobbed off with bromides about the need to put securing students' education first. But who put at risk in the first place?
@grayee Careful now, or Cllr Peppiatt will accuse you of making political points!
@jamogram The standard of QA in the FOI department is shockingly bad. It’s like they make it up as they go along.

@jamogram Another FoI recently answered. I found it on 
@NewhamRecorder The article is wrong. The developer is offering just 51 affordable units out of a total of 838 planned for the site.
@jamogram Wouldn’t hurt to ask. And I don’t believe it either.
@jamogram I find that very hard to credit. Also, they appear to be licensing long-dead versions of a lot of programs. What for?

@Invitetosupper Or ‘celeriac five ways’ as the Masterchef voiceover would have it.
@RichardJMurphy MarsEdit. Works brilliantly with Wordpress.
@StopCityAirport But Robin doesn't think like that. His RoI is 'free' public events at the stadium, covered in mayoral branding.
@StopCityAirport Next stops for those investors will be Boleyn Ground &amp; Stratford Centre. See my blog.
@HackneyAbbott @bilal_cwg Good luck!
Has anyone checked if @NewhamLondon is flying flags at half mast? I hope not, but wouldn't be in the least bit surprised.
@BenPearceSpurs Any word from Poch on when we might see Yedlin in first team action?
Fun fact: in 2014 iOS app developers earned more from Apple than Hollywood did from box office in the US. (via @daringfireball)
@adamcranfield Turns out EE has it now too, so not sure why @ThreeUK haven’t implemented it if it’s available to any network.
@rectripp @bradleyem @fellathebunny Welcome to elected public office! ;-)
@adamcranfield Is visual voicemail still an exclusive to O2? If @ThreeUK succeed in buying them maybe we’ll get it too.
@rectripp @bradleyem @fellathebunny A cynic (not me, obvs!) might think that meant we’ll keep on asking until we get the answer we want.
@aalancraig It’s Martin, but a happy new year to you too. If you followed me you’d see I’d been far from quiet, esp. on #Newham topics!
@StopCityAirport Deleted her Twitter account by the looks of it. Fingers crossed she’s okay.
Sanity prevails in Forest Gate North. No #E7RPZ extension here! 
@fellathebunny I think from what Dianne Walls has said on Facebook that they said yes down there.
@fellathebunny Many thanks!
Oh dear, @aalancraig, look at the kind of people you’re now consorting with: 
Amazing how a govt that can’t afford a pay rise for ambulance crew was able to find the money for a cut in the 50% tax rate. #priorities
Welcome to @E7Magazine, a new online features / listings mag about all fab things going on in Forest Gate: 
@sw19fh True!
@sw19fh Away goals rule is a bit weird in the League Cup, so the clean sheet is only relevant if it's all square after extra time next week.
@sw19fh All our old failings. Unable to break down an inferior but well-organised team. Tried to sit on a lead rather than kill the tie.
@drhotspur Someone needs to explain To Dare is to Do to our players. Lacked ambition after the goal.
@MSmithsonPB @MikeGapes The big story there isn’t the Greens, it’s the LibDems in 5th place.
@FowlerReece The tie is very much alive. Both sides looked like they were happy with 1-0. All to play for!
Two of @SpursOfficial’s nominations for MotM are central defenders. Says a lot about our lack of imagination up front. #THFC #COYS
@FowlerReece On behalf of myself I accept your apology.
@adamcranfield Yes, not a lot of noise except on a couple of breaks. But the team looked like they weren’t bothered about another goal.
Both teams played the last 10 minutes like 1-0 was a result they’d take. Understandable from #SUFC but hope #THFC don’t regret it next week.
Idiot #SUFC fans trying to provoke home fans into a fight on Park Lane. Sensibly  being ignored. Massive chips on their shoulders.
Spurs need to step it up in the second half. Give Lennon a run out. He couldn’t be less effective than Townsend #THFC #COYS
So far #SUFC’s Campbell-Ryce has been the most dangerous player. If only Townsend had half his commitment. #THFC #COYS
@SparrowhawkSo Me too. Though I’d rather she was at the football with me. She’s given up all hope getting here. Maybe she’ll catch it on TV!
@SparrowhawkSo It’s the whole of east/northeast London. My wife is stuck in it somewhere.
Adebayor captain? #THFC #COYS
@fishie1 @aKeepersTale @rectripp @CoLEppingForest Cancel their future pitch bookings. Over time the problem solves itself.
@ruskin147 Much of UK government is still on IE8. And Windows XP.
@fishie1 @rectripp @CoLEppingForest Teams using the Flats should be trusted to tidy up after themselves. Sadly, they obviously can’t be.

At Mario’s Cafe for the traditional pre-match fry-up. Between Spurs &amp; the cholesterol my heart’s in for a hard time tonight #COYS #THFC
Almost 6 months on and there’s still no news on the outcome of the Forest Gate RPZ consultation. #Newham unable to fiddle the figures?
@fest4westham Not quite the response I was expecting, but thank you I am having a perfectly fine day. Posted something on my blog.
@fest4westham Tory government fiddling the figures on employment. 
@Invitetosupper @E7Drew Why do you say the butcher in Wanstead is terrible? We’ve bought from them for years &amp; have no complaints.
New blog post: Affordable housing - where is it in all the new developments in #Newham? 
That’s hopeless, but better than the Stratford Centre proposal which says it won’t include any - either on-site or off-site. #Newham
@copwatcher I have downloaded a copy, which I can email to you. DM the best address.
@copwatcher Hmm. I was looking at it literally 5 minutes ago.
Developers of the Boleyn Ground site are proposing to offer only 51 out of 838 units as affordable housing: 
@RidingtheGoblin @DerkHat @EllieCRobinson @PeterJoyceE7 @lynbrownmp I’m sure you’re right. But from the POV of the customer it seems bonkers
@DerkHat @EllieCRobinson @PeterJoyceE7 @lynbrownmp @greateranglia All other things being equal, why not put customers first?
@MikeGapes Now Guardian/ICM poll has Greens on 9%:

LAB 33%
CON 30%
LDEM 11%
UKIP 11%
GRN 9%


@EllieCRobinson @lynbrownmp … on trains which do run) and then being unable to board trains because of people crowding round the doors.
@EllieCRobinson @lynbrownmp My biggest complaints are general unreliability of the service during morning peak &amp; consequent overcrowding…
@PeterJoyceE7 @EllieCRobinson @lynbrownmp @greateranglia Or frustratingly, stop in the platform on a red signal and refuse to open the doors
Have @BBCNews asked Farage for his opinion on #NoMorePage3 yet?
@sarahbenton Are you sure it’s not an earlier train that was delayed?
@EccentricLDNer @CoLEppingForest No, it was his car. Just lost control on an icy road. Lucky for him he went over where there are no trees.
@EccentricLDNer @CoLEppingForest I see your two dead foxes &amp; raise you a car on its roof (driver walked away unhurt). 
Which makes him a fucking hypocrite.
.@SadiqKhan rightly criticises Tory #Wandsworth for shipping vulnerable families out to Birmingham but remains silent about Labour #Newham.
@SadiqKhan @LabourLeft On which subject, what do you have to say about this latest #Newham atrocity? 
@SadiqKhan @LabourLeft They're only following the example set by #Newham. Don't recall you complaining about that.
Saw @MikeGapes earlier making much of a poll showing Greens on 4%. Latest Ashcroft poll has them on 11% but, oddly, no word from Mike.
CYMI, PwC has issued a 'report in the public interest' on governance failings in the East Ham campus project 
@SuzHu We like it very much, so hopefully you will too! Best F&amp;C used to be on Water Lane, but owners retired &amp; no-one wanted to take it on.
@SuzHu Have you tried Lakeview on Aldersbrook Road, close to the cemetery?
Both @edballsmp &amp; @ed_miliband knew who shot JR. #thingsEdKnew
#Newham is a month overdue in responding to this FoI request on the East Ham town hall project: 
@RCorbettMEP Your wounded sense of entitlement. You don't own the left vote. Try winning people over with policies they want to vote for.
Labour's 'vote Green, keep the Tories in power' scaremongering is repulsive. Attack the real enemy, you idiots.
@RCorbettMEP You really are desperate, aren't you? I'm not a Green but I find Labour's tactics here utterly repellent.
@ForestGreat @StuartCam There's a fireplace shop on Woodgrange Road - opposite the Siam Cafe. Ask in there.
@AberGirl2011 @LabourLeft I'm sick of having an electoral system that forces me to vote tactically. I want to cast a positive vote.
@fghays22 @FocusE15 @hangbitch and still they didn't notice it was being done! Not a very observant or curious bunch…
@fghays22 Evidently not. I don't there often but I did spot on Thursday it had been done up.
@NewhamCons The problem is the #SameOldFaces using the Labour rosette as a flag of convenience.
@fest4westham Recorder just repeated the mayor's "nothing to do with me" line uncritically. Utterly pointless.
@fest4westham Was accused by Cllr Peppiatt of making political points. It's not about point-scoring, it's about competence &amp; accountability.
@fest4westham Read the PwC public interest report I linked to earlier. And my blog posts back in December. Shocking stuff.
I find that increasingly hard to believe. Three officers have been fired. It's time elected members were held to account. #Newham
Leading councillors continue to claim this has nothing to do with them, that officers didn't tell them what was going on. #Newham
"…to enable the establishment of the sixth form in accordance within an appropriate statutory framework. " #Newham
#Newham "Despite numerous meetings over an 18 month period, no appropriate resolution was sought …"
Despite this Cllr Peppiatt insisted at Governors' Forum this week it was not a shambles or a debacle. I beg to differ. #Newham
"… the project proceeded as planned in full knowledge of the legal concerns and associated risks" #Newham
#Newham was told by lawyers it didn't have powers to open the 6th form centre but "despite the delegated decision not being taken properly…"
Overspend of appx £10m on a budget of £14.2m! Members weren't consulted on changes to scope or asked to approve extra spending #Newham
PwC has issued a 'report in the public interest' on governance failings in the East Ham campus project 
@ThreeUKSupport Now connect to Orange F. Thanks. Are they a Feel at Home network for Three customers?
@ThreeUKSupport I had roaming enabled on my 30-day contract &amp; was told in store it would remain when I upgraded. Was that wrong?
Been a subscriber to @macusermagazine since 1992. Sad to see it close.
Deductions from Elected Members Allowances - #Newham ordered by ICO to provide a proper answer. 
@ThreeUK Recently switched from 30-day to 12-month contract &amp; this happens. So angry right now. So angry.
@ThreeUK Gah! Now I can’t use Three In Touch because i’m on a ‘blocked wifi connection’. What the hell are you doing to me????
@ThreeUK Any reason why my phone is getting no service in France? It can ‘see’ Bouygues but won’t connect to the network.
@Saffronbread What a mysterious coincidence!
@IainDale I want a Google spreadsheet with current holders, your predictions and columns for my predictions &amp; the actual results.
@carolinemeaby @maxfineflugle I assume (as it’s lawyers) they got the appropriate change of use consents from the council.
@spursodyssey A more sensible result than the @SpursOfficial poll, which gave it to Paulinho.
@TheTottenhamWay I think we really, really want him succeed. He’s obviously putting the work in &amp; doesn’t complain or make excuses.
Suggesting otherwise is making political points #Newham
Overspending a capital project by £10m &amp; opening a school without any legal power to do so isn’t a shambles or a debacle. #Newham
#Newham Governors Forum tonight at East Ham town hall, as is standards committee on mayor’s conduct. Must make sure I go to the right room!
That said, Kaboul gave the crowd a perfect demonstration of exactly why the manager hasn’t picked him since November. #THFC
After going 2 down in 7 minutes Poch was going to find out a lot about the character of that group of players. Showed they have it. #THFC
Disappointingly thin crowd at the Lane considering tickets were reasonably priced. Magic if the cup seems to have worn a little thin #THFC
@BenPearceSpurs Our 4th killed the game. Last half hour was all about running the clock down. Job done.
@juliannemarriot I’m with you on that, but I don’t think Cameron is acting on any kind of principle.
@juliannemarriot Not yet but I will. This Nick Cohen piece is also worth a read: 
@daisyparker @rectripp Even BT Infinity doesn’t seem as fast as it should be. My previous DSL provider (O2, now Sky) was hopeless.
@mrstevenson Syard? He makes great cheese apparently.
@juliannemarriot For me it’s Padraig Reidy who has the right response. It’s hard to see how Charlie Hebdo could have done anything else.
@NewhamLondon Got wet because my orange bin was full. What am I supposed to do, store it in my house until the moment the collectors arrive?
@NewhamLondon @rectripp Turns out it is taxed until April and has a valid MOT. Still looks abandoned to me though.Oh well.
@NewhamLondon @rectripp Thank you. Can you add abandoned vehicles to #LoveNewham? Redbridge has it as a report category, so it can be done.
Hope to God Spurs don't put me through anything like that tomorrow! #FACup
That's so harsh on Robles. Without him Everton wouldn't have got close to being in a penalty shootout. #WHUEVE #FACup
Loving @btsportfootball's straight-on camera angle for the penalty shootout #WHUEVE #FACup
@DerkHat Ah! I thought she was replying to @RidingtheGoblin and he thought she was replying to me. We were both wrong!
@DerkHat Did Ellie email you about Goblin issues?
Stéphane Charbonnier obituary #JeSuisCharlie 
@rectripp @NewhamLondon Thank you.
@JacobSteinberg Have #WHUFC explained why they're wearing their third kit in a home game? #FACup
@btsportfootball Have #WHUFC explained why they're wearing their third kit in a home game?
@DerkHat Jesus wept!
Either my TV is on the blink or West Ham are playing in their away strip in a home game. WTF is that all about? #FACup #WHUEVE
@JackofKent I hope they pay the price for enabling this vile government come May. Wiped out.
.@NewhamLondon ignored extra box of recycling left out today. So now my orange bin is full again &amp; no collection for 2 weeks. #rubbish
@fest4westham Do you actually believe this rubbish? Fall in real wages + rising prices + VAT increase = real hardship for ordinary families.
@rectripp It maybe that car has tax &amp; MOT &amp; is legally on the road, but I would have appreciated an answer from @NewhamLondon. #LoveNewham
@rectripp This car hasn’t moved for more than 2 months. Reported twice but no reply or action. Can you chase please? 
@NewhamLondon My orange bin was full so I left an extra box of recycling next it. Ignored. Was it not obvious enough? 

#FiveWordsToRuinADate
@WiredUK Good to see you’re paying interns but couldn’t you have stretched from minimum wage to London Living Wage?
@StopCityAirport I know it seems longer but it’s only been 20 years. Hope to God he doesn’t get to celebrate his silver anniversary.
@RidingtheGoblin Yes please. Do you have my email address? If not I’ll DM you with it.
Sir Robin Wales meeting pupils @ncs6th. Explaining how he opened their school without any legal authority? 
@NewhamLondon @ncs6th Explaining how the council opened the school illegally &amp; what he intends to do to protect them from his incompetence?
@timrollpickerin @electoralreform @Andrew_ComRes Tim, will you be so sanguine in May? I hope not!
@SuzHu Wander in to FG for breakfast, coffee and leisurely read of papers @Coffee7FG? Just a thought…
@johnprescott Is that an argument you made to Tony and Gordon between ’97 &amp; 2010? Hats off to you if you did (though I suspect not).
@HackneyAbbott Including #Newham Labour-in-name-only councillor Ayesha Chowdhury 
@ToryTreasury @samirjassal Are you saying there will be no tax increases at all under a Tory government? If so you are lying &amp; you know it.
@mylastsong Typical Spurs - a sniff of 4th place &amp; they get the vapours!
@timothy_stanley @Khyberman "We" meaning the Labour Party", of which he is the leader. Which makes you the poor things.
@RidingtheGoblin @DerkHat I think that would be me.
@DerkHat @RidingtheGoblin You could add Cllr @EllieCRobinson to your list. She represents Forest Gate North &amp; is a #Newham cabinet member.
@DerkHat @RidingtheGoblin Yes she does.
@RidingtheGoblin @DerkHat Er, yes it does. Wanstead Park station is in Lyn’s constituency.
@adampowley Series link ahoy!
@adampowley Picked it up halfway through. Now downloaded from iPlayer so I can see the whole thing. The bit I saw was excellent.
@clooky Good luck with that!
@DianaJohnsonMP So much for IDS’s ‘culture of worklessness’ eh?
As ever, the state’s response to an attack on freedom is to demand more powers &amp; further restrictions on freedom. #MI5
#BBCr4Today 
@smifffy22b I don't watch QT for that very reason. All heat, no light. Bunch of liars rehashing party-approved talking points.
@PompeyGoat @smifffy22b About bloody time too. A tiny corrective to the endless uncritical pro-market neo-liberal BS we are usually fed.
@CareersDefender @E7Drew Try here: 
@CareersDefender @E7Drew I just found it online. Here's the developer's affordable housing statement: 
@e7Drew "the proposal site being entirely unsuitable for on-site affordable housing provision." Surprise, surprise!
@E7Drew "There are a number of unique and exceptional site-specific circumstances which result cumulatively in… (wait for it)
@E7Drew Do you have a link?
@RitsChadha @StopCityAirport Deputy monitoring officer. The monitoring officer was sacked over the East Ham campus/6th form fiasco
@hangbitch @StopCityAirport @FocusE15 My guess is they'll go for the lightest, which is report it to full council &amp; leave it there.
@hangbitch @StopCityAirport @FocusE15 There are sanctions, but which should apply to the mayor is not prescribed. So I think they can choose
@StopCityAirport @hangbitch @FocusE15 It's ambiguous, but could mean the fact the mayor hasn't denied or commented on the complaint.
@StopCityAirport New report "draws no inference from the Mayor’s failure to deny the allegation upon which he chose not to comment at all"
#Newham have declined my #FOI request on their media harassment campaign over Focus E15. Not at all surprised: 
Or Cameron wants Greens to take Labour votes like he fears UKIP will take Tories’.
Cameron saying he won’t do TV debates without Greens isn’t about principle, it’s about self-interest. He wants an excuse to dodge them.
Nigel Farage never fails to live down to my expectations 
@WFRGreens I am appalled by unsurprised. UKIP are the establishment in disguise; Greens a genuine radical alternative.
@copwatcher Okay, that’s a touch more reassuring. But only a touch.
What are we to make of this? Why were the investigator’s report &amp; recommendations changed? 
@copwatcher Was the investigator the monitoring officer (who has since been fired)? Has the revised report been re-written by someone else?
@copwatcher At the risk of mixing metaphors, this reeks of whitewash. And of people being leaned on very heavily.
Letter exchange between law firm and Cleveland Browns. Not quite Arkell vs Pressdram, but funny: 
@RidingtheGoblin Did you get my tweets yesterday about contacting Lyn Brown MP and Newham Cllr Ellie Robinson re overcrowding etc?
@jonworth Not executed, murdered. But otherwise I share your disappointment with our papers.
@EllieCRobinson Ask @RidingtheGoblin - that’s the user group for the line. They have lots of stuff.
@EllieCRobinson See my recent tweets to Lyn re #Goblin overcrowding issues &amp; delays to electrification. Issue for local cllrs too?
@lynbrownmp Just FYI the Barking-Gospel Oak user group is on Twitter - @RidingtheGoblin - so worth a follow to keep up with issues.
@RidingtheGoblin Send info to lyn@lynbrown.org.uk &amp; will she contact TfL.
@RidingtheGoblin West Ham MP Lyn Brown (Wanstead Park is in her constituency) has been alerted to overcrowding issues. Would like more info.
@lynbrownmp Many thanks.
@macsparky Re: “Dear Monster Lawyers”, another candidate for the best attorney letter ever written: 
@politicalhackuk @LabourLeft Seen some Tories trying to rebrand mansion tax as ‘Labour’s family home tax’. Desperate &amp; out of touch.
@lynbrownmp See page 2 of this newsletter: 
@lynbrownmp No prospect of longer trains until electrification, which has been delayed to 2019. Something needs to be done.
@lynbrownmp A little closer to home, your constituents face serious overcrowding on the Barking - Gospel Oak line, especially during peak.
