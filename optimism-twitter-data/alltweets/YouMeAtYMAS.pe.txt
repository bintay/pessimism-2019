@Kentlaar pretty sure this was us at one point hahah 
Legit done with my life tbh I hate everything.
@cmdxray yeah I hope so lol. I wanna move to the us anyway eventually
@cmdxray no matter where it is, the minimum wage is very poor
@cmdxray I think the minimum wage in London is higher but it's because everything is more expensive
@cmdxray ah yeah so same here. However it's impossible to actually live on the minimum wage so it's not very good <CONFUSED FACE>
@cmdxray wow that would =to £4.72 here lol
@cmdxray what's ur minimum wage
@cmdxray think I saw a bit of that lol
@cmdxray which = $10
@cmdxray £6.50 an hour
@cmdxray unless it's a restaurant and even then it's a tiny tip at the end and you don't have to. Lol
@cmdxray legit no one does it here no one cares like we don't actually accept them

If a muslim tweeted #killchristians they must be a “terrorist”, but a christian tweeting #killmuslims is expressing their freedom of speech
@parahorizons it's exactly the same here :(
@parahorizons wouldn't surprise me considering how much the media just love to talk about it

(Sorry for the bad English)
@parahorizons but they won't so ppl need to wake the fuck up and realise there's extremists in every walk of life
@parahorizons and i blame the media for giving the public a fake view of it all. I like how they never talk about Christians abusing kids
@parahorizons yup but most morons don't realise it's not the entire region. Muslin hate crime has increased in the last year
@parahorizons like isis have killed muslims because they refuse to follow them
@parahorizons do these things. When in reality no, it's not Islam. Ffs. So people need to stop the whole hate against muslim shit
@parahorizons yeah exaclty that isn't Islam which is what people need to realise. They use religion as an excuse to
People are so blind if they think the media isn't trying to turn people against muslims

@fartypoison yeah true, their thought process was they hate all ppl who aren't British so they wanna vote ukip
@fartypoison teachers*
@fartypoison I didn't care until I was 18 and realised I could vote this year
@fartypoison which I guess is positive cus they wanted to vote ukip anyways if they did care lmao
@fartypoison yeah true but my reaches were giving them all this info about it and convincing them and they were just like we don't care
@fartypoison then again,if they were giving the right to vote they may start to care

@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 @FeministFailure @MT8_9 you're the one referring to gender?  I am saying rape effects everyone.
@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 @FeministFailure @MT8_9 regardless of gender people are people and rape is serious
@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 @FeministFailure @MT8_9 when did I mention tumblr? I also said it matter that men are raped.
@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 these are REAL people and should not be made into a statistic. Now goodbye.
@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 however, you're actually wrong. 1 in 20 women are raped, 1 in 71 men are raped. However
@thotpalace @Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 it doesn't matter if they are? Rape is serious for men or women and can effect both.
@Kentlaar did you seriously just say buzzing?
@AnanSawitree that isn't my opinion. It's just what I've heard from others. My friends and family etc.
@AnanSawitree everyone I've met that are voting ukip would hate you because in their eyes you would not be British.
@AnanSawitree I already said I don't agree with any party. my point is I don't like most ppl that vote ukip
@AnanSawitree I dislike them all but I dislike MOST. People that vote ukip. Unfortunately they are all very racist :(
WHY ARE 14 YEAR OLDS TRYING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT POLITICS :(
@band_whxre okay you're clearly naive in this matter. Bye.
@AnanSawitree in reality we are just controlled lmfao I don't believe any is good for the county
@AnanSawitree no. My beliefs are all politicians are liars. We are forced into this system and deluded into thinking we have a say
@AnanSawitree vote for him.
@AnanSawitree OR you're used to convince people like me that Nigel farriage isn't a complete moron. Which you're failing at I will never
@band_whxre yeah so are my family and it's cause they don't understand correctly. They sound great right? 
@AnanSawitree which I disagree with. Not to mention sexist and homophobic.
@AnanSawitree I don't generally, however most I have met are voting because they are racist and want all foreign ppl out of the country
@rian_johnson yes
@band_whxre 1) people voting ukip and 2) ukip themselves. Have you ever read their policies?
@band_whxre it really does though considering most of them are racist, sexist and homophobic. That in my book is a piece of shit :)
@band_whxre it was intended to be
And at the same UKIP will take women's rights away!!  
I treat everyone equal unless you're voting for UKIP

Then you're a piece of shit and I hate you.
@Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 @thotpalace stuff like what? He his a total idiot therefore her response was valid.
@Patrickcurran69 @jackie_16_9 @thotpalace I think she meant it sarcastically. Aka his failed attempt at an argument

@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks that would be insanity.
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks and defending trophy hunters is wrong. Like I said humans murder humans, use them as trophies
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks I disagree with trophy hunting. She is disgusting and everyone like her is.
Ur profile pic ain't legal  
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks yeah but these people don't hunt to eat. It is trophies, clearly stated from pics so why defend it

@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks what she is doing.
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks but whatever its your opinion. I however don't agree with any hunting and I think it's wrong
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks considered murder,  along with a bit of insanity.
@DeiterE73 @courtneylr94 @GervaisTwonks I think it's wrong to pose with a dead animal you just killed. If humans did that it would be

You say you care so much about animals so why is it only a positive that people care about animals if they're vegan (c)
Be happy that someone is trying to actually care about animals instead of wanting to attempt to hunt and kill them? (C)

@Lulverine @Beastlychuk I'm a pretty open minded person tbh I just want people to be happy without judging others life styles
@Beastlychuk @nikkipaigee awesome, sorry for sounding rude before. Usually guys on twitter are trolling  feminists.
@Beastlychuk @nikkipaigee happen cus people are fucked. But we need to realise that it's the person who raped fault, not the victim
@Beastlychuk @nikkipaigee exaclty people are ignorant and that's what we need to get away from. Victim blaming. Obviously rape will always
@YouMeAtYMAS YOU'RE
And as long as your happy then do it
I mean I really don't care what gender, sexuality, religion or even fucking shoe size you are. I care about making your own choices
My literal beliefs are that everyone should be treated equally. That's all I want. I don't give a shit what gender you are
@Beastlychuk @nikkipaigee I hope you mean it's avoidable by teaching people not to rape? (Everyone as both genders can be raped)
But still. If ur bf cheats on you then don't go calling the girl a slut, you shouldn't date an asshole
Unless she knows he has a gf ofc
BEING INTERESTED IN A GUY. IT'S WRONG FOR A GUY TO LEAD A GIRL ON WHEN HE HAS A DAMN GF THAT SHIT IS FUCKED UP
"If he got a gf leave him alone don't be a slut" SHIT NO HOW ABOUT THE GUY TELL THE GIRL HE AIN'T INTERESTED. GIRLS AREN'T SLUTS FOR

@Superphoenix411 @WeNeedFeminlsm my point is both genders are equal, you don't use each gender to bash each others equality
@Superphoenix411 @WeNeedFeminlsm nope, I believe everyone is equal. But when you try to bash woman by including mens rights that doesnt work

Whatever arguments about politics are pointless everyone has their own opinions,  as long as your opinion doesn't effect someone's life.
@trigg_27 Ukip want everyone the same- they hate others that are different and that worries me
@trigg_27 as long as it doesn't harm someone else.
@trigg_27 you have an opinion by voting ukip as ukip is against these regions. You're allowed an opinion
Years ago the media influenced people to hate the Jews resulting in millions of deaths. They're doing the same with muslims #VoteUKIP no.

Depression and suicide anyways so don't start trying to fucking defend people. All suicide is terrible
And most people that jump on the 'there's more depressed people' boat are usually the ignorant fucks that don't understand

And anyone that knows me knows I'm the first one to hate one direction fans lol. But this isn't a '1D fan' they're fucking humans that have
They are obviously mentally ill and it shouldn't be taken lightly. Six people have lost their lives, family have lost their children.
Most likely would have done it later in life as they already have it triggered in their brain. Whether their reason is 'valid' or not (c)
And depression is; it can be there.. waiting for you and all it takes is to be triggered by something small. People that kill themselves (c)
(C) there with actual mental health problems,  killing yourself over that is stupid!" What people need to realise about suicide(c)
Okay so there's about 6 1D fans that have killed themselves and I have seen various comments of "that's disgusting, there is people out- (c)

And i also liked my iPhone

They both make good phones but they're both fucking shit companies
However I like my s5 so screw you fucking guys
android and apple are both shit and they both just care about making money so everyone needs to stop bitching about which ones are better
Rant over sorry
IPHONES ARE ALSO SHIT
THE ONLY REASON ANDROID PHONES ARE EVER CHEAPER IS BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING SHIT
AND ANOTHER FUCKING THING WHY DO ANDROID USERS SAY ANDROID PHONES ARE CHEAPER LIKE THE SAMSUNG S6's ARE THE SAME PRICE AS IPHONES
Yet android users say its better bc storage and removable batteries!!!!

Either way all companies care about is making money stfu
Like it legit looks like an iPhone,  has no removable battery and no expandable memory.. cough iPhone cough
The Samsung Galaxy S6 is basically an iPhone<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
