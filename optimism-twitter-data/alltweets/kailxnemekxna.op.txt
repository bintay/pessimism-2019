i've tried my best to not be bitchy about you and this whole situation, but it's gone way too far.
i am so done with you, i don't care what happens to you anymore.

@princessacamp i think elizabeth and kay just shot a gun to the whole bechloe fandom
wow i feel bad for the people who live in a country their idol doesn't live in. and i thought 75 miles away was bad enough
i just memorized the rap to problem. like what <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
if it's not late for elizabeth banks to change the canon, i suppose she should put a bechloe make out scene somewhere ??
OH MY GOD SARAH JUST SAVED ME TANKS

i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks he's a fanboy obsessed with me. tanks mama champ
@Quotefeed47 idk
@Quotefeed47 she's part of the movie but people think anna camp was written out of the movie bc she was a senior in pp but brittany was too
some people can be mentally ill sometimes
"anna camp was a senior in pp. i don't think she'll be in the sequel" bitch then why is brittany snow there?
i was there when her icon was a selfie and her header was birds on a telephone pole
@AnnaKendrick47 hi twin
no i'm not an attention whore, i just like being in the spotlight.
serena thinks malam minggu means sex night aha
booty had me like 
i'm gonna m keep my language setting on my phone to bahasa indonesia
@ArianaGrande has anyone ever told you that you're selfies are the best?
@RebelWilson @PitchPerfect can i order that jacket ?
no just kidding
OR SHE'S PREGNANT
she's either me or she's on her period. just a guess
anna's current obsession of sweets and ice cream terrifies me a little bit
nONONONO THIS ISNT REAL
i guess i can't be trusted at the beach without my parents. kay. i feel like punching them.
my brother thinks harry shum jr. is his brother hahaha
i'm flattered, but i like my boys zac efron.

@blakrena32 hi i love you
"i don't even use twitter" you fucking liar
@desiree17m ahaha same
or is it bc justin's is really bad and ariana makes it better?
am i the only person who feels that ariana's cover of justin bieber's die in your arms is the original?
that means i've been here for a really long time.. damn i feel old and unaccomplished.
remember when she posted the picture of her and her mom from a looong time ago last mother's day? that felt like ages ago <FLUSHED FACE>
@ZacEfron @RebelWilson this is the best thing ever
@RebelWilson @ZacEfron ZEBEL <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>

my girlfriend everyone 
sarah's new pickup line: "will you be the stacie to my cynthia-rose?"

pitch perfect makes the riff off so freaking easy it frustrates me

yeah you're a good writer and all but you're a fucking bully
the kid can pick strings better than me <CHERRY BLOSSOM><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #miracles #maileelissa 
okay seriously i could not have been the only one thinking that
i have to poop. but i cant get up
yay another DJ gig!!
well steven's a little sassy today
i just stole another portos oops
twitter is dangerous as shit, but i love it more than my real friends
why do the bride and groom at the party always look so stressed out on their wedding day?
i'm so abnormal. why can't i just write in a diary like a normal person from the 1900's?
haha she was such a bitch.
*facepalm*
OH YES PORTOS
@carlyr2000 @princessacamp lol jb things are under castin bc people ship girls with the prefix "cas" and justin, hence the name castin
wtf is wrong with twitter rn
especially if you're putting down a celebrity who has done absolutely nothing to you.
i know fanfics were made for fans to tell their stories but don't use it as an excuse talk shit about other people
that mimi chic pisses me off so much it seems too much for satan to handle
@campersxastin i've grown to be okay with her i guess. but the original bellas are by far the best
"like f!" ? are you crapping with me? that is the most stupid thing ever. coming from you too
okay i guess i can consider liking her
ARIEL AND ERIC FOREVER <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
just kiss the damn girl already
can flounder be my best friend? <TROPICAL FISH>

ayy turn up 
i feel like diane's my real mom. she is seriously the best
i love my mama champ <TWO HEARTS>
aw diane just gave me the longest hug and it made my day :)
our school has the worst fashion ever.. or is it just the fact we have to wear uniform?
bc i actually look good and this, and everyone else looks like a bitch 
you made me delete one of the cutest pictures ever and you think we're still friends?
when your friend likes a video of your idol that you posted on your personal account, then you two are bestfriends
so her middle name is her grandma's last name? ohkay.. i guess that makes sense
i'm part of that stupid thing yet i have no saying in it? hey guess what i fucking hate the both of you
you can't force me to make your otp a reality. if you think you can you're stupid
that picture would have been way better without you
you made me delete that beautiful picture just to save me from you bitch. why did i ever call you a friend?
you are literally the worst friend ever
no you are one of the worst people ever.
okay i'm not fucking joking about this one. you're a real bitch
if you've never heard of what's so good about perfection then we can't be friends
but grace phipps is perfect
teen beach movie is a big disappointment.
@fanclubSkylar okay thank you!
@fanclubSkylar whAT WHEN WHERE I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS

i don't even have my own mom stop me from watching and doing what i wanna do so don't even try
you don't control what i watch. you ain't my mother. i will watch all the shit i want to
i'll watch pretty little liars and pitch perfect if i want to. i will watch it the day i die and you're not stopping me
bitch i will watch all the pg-13 that i want. i don't need no overprotective stranger telling me what to do
you ain't my mama. you a ratchet ass stranger who's bossing my sorry ass around.
i wasn't tagged in it but i'm not crying and unfollowing them bc of how she didn't "notice" me
well... i didnt ask to be the oldest
@CottonCandyCamp you've been in for so long! i don't think i can last that long in a fandom.. hopefully i can
@CottonCandyCamp oh sorry oops
i will officially be in this fandom for a year tomorrow <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
sarah's bigass hair is hiding me so i'm good
okay i think i've made my point
that text convo was more stupid than brittany s pierce omg.
@CottonCandyCamp there isn't even a real picture of them together with no one else in it. yet they hate on us
people treat jeca like a religion. they have so much hope and faith that it will happen. how are these people still believing?
@CottonCandyCamp oh i bet they'll love it
at least mr. dudley liked the whole "-A" thing.
i incorporated pretty little liars in my english essay today. i feel so accomplished.
hey mom. go home. you're drunk
oh hey mom. i'm actually at school right now, if you didn't know, so i need you to call me later.
my mom is calling my phone wtf
my mom is essentially cruella de vil
no seriously i can't even get up
school and cramps. two things i have and love. what joy.
i just wanna move to aulani with my phone, my ukulele, and a lifetime supply of chocolate ultra milk
but i'll just be fine with a tca surfboard or a kca blimp. that's cool too.
yeah, well i just landed my first leading role in a school production. what now, bitch?
how do you just automatically switch? that doesn't make any sense at all.
I JUST BIT MYSELF BC IM HAPPY OW
the mcdonalds in indonesia sell rice. can we just appreciate that?

why is california hot as hell but the ocean is freezing as arendelle?
aw, you're otp had an on-screen kiss? how cute. my otp had real-life sex.
@2fandoms @princessacamp AMEN
my dad's bringing pendeta muskita into this what even
you don't understand how MyVEGAS Slots has ruined my parents.

mom. mom. hey mom. <RAISED FIST><WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è<WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><RAISED HAND> you talk too much.
okay even i'm getting frustrated
uhm aca-scuse me?! since when did i become part of this argument?!
and this is all coming from my parents. is that not weird?
i'm pretty sure fangirling and crying over people is better than arguing over a stupid game.

@CastinForLife aw thank you ! :)
why don't you go fuck yourself and i'll be waiting for you to get your head out of your tiny ass
my idols and brittany are like the only people i don't want to kill right now

you call yourself a best friend? i don't think so. as far as i'm concerned you're just a bully.
it's gotten to the point where i trust no one but brittany and all i can do is cry myself to sleep
i'm being so dixie chicks serious rn. can you like please not and let me live my life?
is brittany my only friend now?
i like white boys and i'm okay with that. if you're my friend and you're not okay with it i'm sorry but i don't give a fuck
