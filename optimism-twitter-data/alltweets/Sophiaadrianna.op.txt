Today is really really not my day. I'm really really sad.
I'm half hoping Taylor Swift will shock everyone and show Katy Perry as the last guest star for the Bad Blood music video
Team: Will try to make you feel better and speak words of encouragement to you but can't take own advice when feeling like shit

Lolololol 
*writes post about body positivity, suddenly has horrible self esteem day* lololol
Sometimes I hate how tall I am. Today is one of those days.
@ryleejacobs I luh yew <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@buffalosaucebby <FACE THROWING A KISS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
Karlie Kloss is the same age as me :/ wth
I have the illest craving for a hotdog???
@sweeney_n yes, still killing it
I survived landmark not knowing it'd be packed 2k15 
Guys are lucky because literally all the girls at Landmark were killing it tonight meanwhile they all looked subpar and grimy af
@dylanweiss666 old crusty white men
"I love country music" 
*swipes left tbh
My skin is so messed up that I don't know I have sunburn until I start peeling because I just assume the pain is normal lololololol
Me 99% of the time tbh 
If you want to be updated on my life don't even bother actually communicating with me, just look at my Twitter !!
I want whoever writes my eulogy to do it in only hand drawn emojis
Weekly tweet about how I'm not petting nearly as many dogs as I should be in life
<SPARKLES> Competitive napper <SPARKLES>
U can follow me to see how rad my life is without u sure but I won't follow u back because u suck tbh
@erinmaglietta *start your work
Intern requirements: current university enrollment, 5 yrs of experience, skill with a program you've never heard of, &amp; your first born son.
@erinmaglietta also get off of Twitter and get back to work
@erinmaglietta *~ home is where the fart is ~*
Is it normal for jobs to ask if you've gotten your measles shot? Like is there something I should be concerned about?
You're not a real adult if you have to text your mom to find out what vaccines you got and there is nothing wrong with that
Even if I can understand what is being said in a movie or tv show if the subtitles are on I will automatically read them
I could vomit right now mainly cause ate a lot of Chinese food in a short amount of time &amp; moved more than I did the entire day right after
Rowan keeps asking me to fill out a post graduation survey but it doesn't have "Drink a lot, panic, and cry" as an option
@blackbeanqueen crew is hot
<SPARKLES>carpe diem<SPARKLES> 
I've got a pretty rad mom and I'm very very lucky to have her
Man, all this laying around doing nothing but napping and eating all day has sure made me hungry and tired!
@alex_stolte do I also sign away my rights and soul because that deal is too good to be true
When did Miley Cyrus's brother become so attractive???
I need new glasses
@blackbeanqueen @buffalosaucebby I saw you like this @erinmaglietta are you in???
My bath is super yellow right now cause of the bath bomb I used so it almost looks like I'm bathing in urine lololololol
@blackbeanqueen @buffalosaucebby !!!! I almost said the same thing that Jenna did lmao
People who write "HBD" are gross. Like what's the point of being friendly if you're going to make it seem forced and inconvenient for you???
@blackbeanqueen queen <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Dominican food is high key the best, I can't wait to go home and drown in my grandmother's cooking tbh
I feel like everyone knows something I don't and it makes me very nervous and anxious
I forgot that he built AN ENTIRE HOUSE for her in The Notebook like that would've been really awkward if she actually didn't like him at all
but not being able to articulate that I mean what rich old republican call hippies and not actually ~hippies~
I've been getting myself into a lot of trouble calling people fellow hippies
@skwerlyman789 yes yes that too
it's the saturday before my last graduation ever and I'm here sober, laying on top of bras, trying to figure out what to watch on Netflix
It'd be easier to do things when I was bored if I weren't limited to a broken bike
I came to my room for something specific but then I laid on my bed and now I don't remember nor do I care cause I'm too comfy to move
My entire life can be boiled down and compared to that awkward silence when a comedian tells a bad joke that no one laughs at
I miss when Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush were happy and together <PENSIVE FACE>
*~*~Now's ur chance ~*~*
I wish I could find as solid pair of thigh friendly overalls
I'm going to be so salty seeing everyone's @Radio1045 #1045BdayShow pics tomorrow while I'm not there also having fun<WEARY FACE>
PSA: don't tell a boy that he kinda looks like someone famous cause there is a 95% chance he'll put a side by side pic on his tinder profile
Manic pixie dream dad is a thing too thanks to Bob Saget
Petetiton to get all racist sexist idiots off of the Internet &amp; put in a playpen or something so they can all cry about how society changed
lol yo 
This @QuirkyMPDG Twitter account is the best thing I've read all day
<SPARKLES>Friend<SPARKLES> 
One time someone walked in on me using the bathroom at a Walmart and I've never been the same since.
Highlights from the last Fly Trap Party EVER 
There is no better way to be woken up than a big dog jumping into bed with you and giving you kisses
I'm so happy to have met such rad people and to have made such lovely friends, so many just within this year. My heart feels full and mushy
I want to make boys squirm and nervous with how much of a catch I am tbh
I get defensive over things I shouldn't be defensive about
I support girls supporting other girls
@blackbeanqueen I'm sorry I missed this
Looks 
@sweeney_n are you still coming?!?!
@blackbeanqueen where are you????<WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
Lol crusty old white people always killing vibes tho
COME TO OUR PARTY (we may or may not have a slip and slide for 7&amp; under)  

Love, Your Hippie Aunt
Aesthetic: mom jeans and dad jokes
I counted 27 caterpillars on my walk home. 27 wow
It's so nice outside I almost don't mind my sun allergy.
Actually starving send help
I may or may not be willing to give my first born son for some Chinese food right now.
Everything you do and everything you've done is and has been for someone else, someone unworthy of that time. It's time you move forward.
The lower my voice is the more comfortable I am with you tbh I speak like 5 octaves higher for strangers
I have the illest craving for Chinese food simply because I was talking shit about @alex_stolte eating cold Chinese food
Pros of sleeping alone: more blankets and space 
Cons of sleeping alone: sleeping alone
It's me your hippie aunt 
"my goals are to be so intimidatingly hot that people are surprised at how nice I am when i talk to them"
lol cigarettes
I'm slowly turning into that cool hippie looking aunt who wears headbands and like 12 necklaces and talks about green tea infused things
@buffalosaucebby @blackbeanqueen you guys are too kind srsly <TWO HEARTS>
@blackbeanqueen cuz I realized I post way too many selfies and are def annoying people :/
@jodidziedzic OMG I hate that too!!!
Why are women so sexualized???? Seriously a girl can't say boob without some horny crusty dude losing it. Seriously chill the fuck out
I want to see a razor commercial where they shave hairy legs to prove that it works best because I'm not sold with these hairless ones
This is lowkey me 
a/s/l?
My form of seduction is just to exist and hope that's enough for someone
I've watched enough Scooby Doo to sleep that Netflix now suggest the Barbie Show and I'm not really proud of that
(Mind you this was the same night as the drunk selfie)
I want to be this pretty all the time tbh 
lol that time I was taking a drunk selfie and thought I saw a spider but it was really a fuzz ball. Enjoy 
My laugh is literary the most irritating thing in the world
Oh wait...
That one Woody Allen movie with a pessimistic narcissistic man and the cute optimistic hopeful girl who changes his mind about himself
Seeing lanky teenage boys makes me miss my brother a lot :/
I have a feeling like it's going to take forever for May 14th to actually arrive
I'm the kind of person who waves at dogs like they will wave back
Future wedding looks 
lol Very Good Girls is pissing me off and it's only 30 minutes in lol
tbh I've been saving all my really sad tweets into drafts this week
- how are you?
- *well I'm masking my extreme anxiety, I have no money, and I just cried about a camera lens cap at work
- lol I'm great!
I just want ice cream and security of my future but I can't have either of those things
when you have to choose between eating or saving for the alcohol you're in desperate need of drinking on the weekend
@blackbeanqueen @alex_stolte can u bring some to me
Lol send help  
Gimme ten please 
"What are you doing after graduation?" 
You can choose to sit stoically &amp; take the great people you've met for granted by not allowing yourself to feel/acting superior, but I won't
I really sick of people judging me for being sad about leaving the part of my life where I learned a lot about myself and made great friends
I am kinda mush rn &amp; I have every god damn right to be. Don't perpetuate your negative emotionless bullshit and stop thinking feeling is bad
Today I ate a cookie that fell on the rug with no shame or hesitation because you have to treat yourself no matter what
My type vs. Erin's type in the style of the adult versions of Hey Arnold characters 
@buffalosaucebby thanks bad <FACE THROWING A KISS><TWO HEARTS>
College taught me that you can microwave ramen if you really tried, neon tank tops are a red flag, rugby booty is prime booty, &amp; friendship
"I miss you"  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I will stop making barfing sounds at stupid men when they stop being stupid until then *voms <SLEEPY FACE>
@erinmaglietta STAHP YOU ARE JUST AS BROKE AS ME BABE
@erinmaglietta #poor D:
@erinmaglietta lol for a second I though you were just informing me of your location
I guess I won't be covering this song any time soon 
I don't even mean in dates, just like if I roll up to taco bell I want them to be like "Dam B this one's on the house" tbh
Lowkey goals: to be cute enough where people feed me without me paying for it.
I'm hungry. Where is a grandma when you need her.
I had a dream that I had money. Hmm...must be nice
YOoOooooOOoo
 
@floydlumpkin dad humor ftw
@floydlumpkin gno way that's gonna happen (sorry I saw my opportunity)
Life hack: Don't make someone think you're interested in them if you're not or if you plan on leaving them anyway
Tbh I don't want to see your tacos and nachos unless you plan on sharing
This place is a bubble; the same stories and words bounce right back. I'm tired of having this perpetual déjà vu.
It's really hard to think you're worth much when people so readily lose interest in you
Imagine the first person who took their smartphone into the bathroom with them. Their friends probably thought they had the runs
The word I was looking for is adopt
I almost just said I want to "download" a dog out loud.
My favorite thing in the world is how fluffy puppies sashay when they walk because they're so fluffy and fabulous
I want to be reincarnated as a sloth when I die
*wants love and acceptance 
*is kind of a bitch?
I'm super sad to leave but at the same time I can't wait to leave because I'm tired of this shit tbh
Stop with the mustaches and sombreros, stop wearing bindis to music fests, stop doing blackface, stop wearing headdresses. Stop being racist
If you're one of those people who makes every thing a competition and flourishes on lackluster and nonsensical approval you need to chill
How you handle things says more a lot about you than anyone else
I'm pretty sure someone in the group of boys next to me took a picture of me which makes me extremely uncomfortable and violated lololololol
@blackbeanqueen Phil looks so sad :(
I'm not going to wear pants when it's hot outside just because you think I'm showing too much leg. I'm tall okay I'm practically all legs
How sad are the people who are passionate about nothing but their own lives
Repeat after me: Not using slang or popular acronyms does NOT make me superior or more intelligent than those who do tbh
(Note: not that all pop punk is like that just specifically sad boy pop punk)
Moment of silence for sad boys who listen to sad boy pop punk that always blames their manic pixie dream girl for not being perfect
*Vomits all over u &amp; ur pseudo masculinity displayed with ur increase need to assert ur "given" dominance whenever a woman corrects u
My cool girl exterior is just a cover up for my significantly cooler but moderately insecure cool girl interior
Jake Bahari wasn't even that cute
I can't wait until my life is on fleek
I smell like camp fire and I'm not wearing pants; all is restored in the world
Alexa Chung is actual perfection tho
Life hack: put enough lime and orange slices in ur beer to mask the fact that beer is p gross but it's cheap and that's why u got it
When I was in 2nd grade I did the chacha slide with 2 other girls for our talent show and we won 1st place lol
@RUArtCollective IVE NEVER BEEN SO DISRESPECTED IN MY LIFE GUYS THIS IS A PERFECTLY GOOD CAKE WTH!!!!!
@alex_stolte @BrandonStJeanos @erinmaglietta @MasonJoody @jodidziedzic @blackbeanqueen @ryleejacobs 2 think this all started cuz of my tweet
@erinmaglietta @MasonJoody @alex_stolte @jodidziedzic @blackbeanqueen @ryleejacobs @BrandonStJeanos guys I have a confession okay here goes
@ryleejacobs @erinmaglietta @alex_stolte @jodidziedzic @blackbeanqueen @BrandonStJeanos fear of missing out aka the worst thing everrrtr
@riffrafflove you are way too sweet babe!!
What do stink bugs even do for the world? Do they pay taxes? NO
My eyeliner game is strengthening 
I wish there was an actual chill pill because I need to chill like 99% of the time just because of anxiety
me: black lives matter
irrelevant dumb crusty people who need to chill: excuse me, uhm, all lives matter
me: ...black lives matter
*takes decent photo. posts it on all social media platforms
I'm torn between three variations of the same picture for my new profile picture/everything picture
Stop doing lame things. Stop living lame lives.
lol the things people do are so lame. Stop being lame
@erinmaglietta @blackbeanqueen making moves y'all
@erinmaglietta sorry that was supposed tone attach to Jenna's tweet about getting iced treats later
@erinmaglietta ????
@blackbeanqueen when?!?! I'm in class until 6:00!!
Like I'm actually forcing myself to chill so expect to see a lot of ugly tears next week tbh
This week is going to consist of me heavily repressing the sadness that I feel every time I realize I'm leaving all the awesome people I met
The bulk of my work is finally done. If I could do backflips, I'd be doing them right now
@blackbeanqueen yes please!
I'm going to eat my chipwich then take a nap before I finish my paper because I deserve a break
If I could wear these every day I probably wouldn't because I'd break my ankles 
Remember that time John Mayer said his dick was a white supremacist? Smh he was cute up until that moment
What the heck the moon is so cute!
I just want to take the moment to thank @blackbeanqueen @erinmaglietta and Jess for not judging me as I sing old school Demi Lovato aloud rn
Imagine having enough money to have an apartment in New York with exposed brick and hardwood floors. I feel like media makes that seem easy
Honestly, there is no reason for me to not do this work. I need to stop fucking around.
My laptop does this cute thing where it shuts off at 30% to keep things exciting between me and it <TWO HEARTS>
remember when I was really into Thrice and American Football and listened to them everyday. I was a former sad boy tbh
Actual Tip: if u need help focusing on reading something boring, read it in your mind with an accent. I swear it helps me every single time
Lifehack: Drink a lot of water to keep yourself hydrated as you run away from your responsibilities
Me whenever someone one starts to ask me what my plans for after graduation are 
I might just be coming from a (sort of) photographer's angle but its so sweet. 10/10 would recommend more people do that and spread beauty
tbh there is something really sweet about someone thinking you look nice and/or beautiful and wanting to capture it in a photograph for you
I need a new profile picture so can someone please take pics of me when you think I'm doing something cute and profile pic worthy
I was joking with this tweet  yet here I am 2 hours later still not doing work and about to take a nap while watching a Nicolas Cage movie.
Unfabulous is not that good so now we're watching National Treasure
Well now that I know Unfabulous is on Netflix I certainly cannot and will not get anything productive done
What if you had to pitch yourself in the way that used car dealers sell cars
I'm a pretty well rounded person. I don't know how to do my taxes, but I care about a lot of things, have a cute butt, and like animals
Is it wrong to think that I'm a catch cause (tonight) I think I'm a catch
@blackbeanqueen &amp; are completely capable of getting out of if they stopped the pity party for appeal or lackluster sympathy
@blackbeanqueen <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> especially when these sad things are ones they gotten themselves into
@blackbeanqueen ugh I'm sick of it
dear sad boys, 
I finished a 1 page paper now time for a 3 hour break.
Stop dumping your shit on other people and not giving them the same respect they give you unless the topic is about you 2K15
I don't like being used thnx!!1!!!
The other day I tried to do the foot in the sink thing but my pants were too tight so I got a wedgie and pulled a muscle
@buffalosaucebby lol everyone has at least 3 of those friends who always shares vids on fb it's a god send for procrastinating
I want nothing more than to be surround by dogs and pizza right now.
@buffalosaucebby yeah that's the only reason I tolerate it tbh and also the cute animal videos everyone always posts now
That interaction was a lot more in my favor when I imagined it in my head
@buffalosaucebby okay that makes sense cause I couldn't find you
@buffalosaucebby yes! I'm going to add you on fb right now to invite you!
This is the second time this week that I've had a dream that Erin and I owned baby goats together
Twitter causes me more stress than it should. I need to change that
Tonight I met @buffalosaucebby irl and she is as majestic and beautiful as she seems tbh
Why are things so weird?
If I don't have my hand in front of my face or my eyes closed its probably not a picture I will actually post
I actually have the hottest bestfriend holy poop<WEARY FACE> <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
PSA: stop letting me convince you to bum a cigarette off of you while I am drunk!!!!!
@blackbeanqueen @buffalosaucebby Jenna you look like the most content and please little kitten ever!!
"If you're tired of my shit, take a nap" - @TheHottieTaylor (who didn't want to tweet it himself)
Panini more like panono lol amirite? lol
@bvanderhorn it's okay! I just didn't want to seem like I was full of myself which I was afraid would happen with the amount I've posted
.@erinmaglietta *turns down car radio to look at dog on sidewalk
And that's all, thanks for being understanding!
but if you can possibly understand that I'm only coming from a place of exhaustion w hating myself &amp; trying to finally learn self acceptance
So I sincerely apologize if my selfies annoy you and my slight growth in confidence comes across as vanity
It's taken me very long to get to a place where I am comfortable with posting pictures of myself more than just once in a blue moon.
@bvanderhorn It's like therapy to get out of that general mindset because it's easy to forget those fleeting moments. Less of a vanity thing
@bvanderhorn I know personally the selfies I post act as reminders that in that moment I actually liked how I looked despite conflict
@blackbeanqueen <FACE THROWING A KISS> bae
@SymoneSalib if I can get enough papers done on Saturday you bet your pretty bum we will!!
@SymoneSalib <KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES> Symone we need to cry together soon
Also it was such an important day because my friends were there &amp; I felt special for the first time in my life. I'm so thankful it happened
Remember how freaking cute I looked at my birthday party earlier this semester  <SPARKLES><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><MILKY WAY><DIZZY SYMBOL><ROCKET><SPARKLES> 
You gotta find somebody who doesn't use your weaknesses as their strengths
@blackbeanqueen <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Weekly tweet about how much I hate anxiety
*doesnt have explosive diarrhea btw
It isn't fun and I want to punch myself every time
I imagine conversations about all that could possibly be wrong with me that they mentioned and make fun of me about so I'm like a huge joke
My favorite feature about myself is how I think everyone associated with a person who I'm sure doesn't like me, also doesn't like me
Dear Lee Pace, I'm ready when u r.
@SymoneSalib I have class <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
@SymoneSalib ugh let's schedule an ugly crying get together
@SymoneSalib SHUT UP SYMONE YOURE MAKING ME SAD <WEARY FACE>
What do you do if you have explosive diarrhea before a final? Asking for a friend.
@ginger_lizard Imagine that she's the actual mug holding all of them together because that's all they really let her do.
You're welcome for your success. I'm glad I can be of service to you of course without credit because you're a self centered prick. Subtweet
STOP CATCALLING IT'S NOT CUTE
Why are like 80% of straight white college boys the anti-christ?
Guess who didn't know she had an exam this morning!
Also properly shape my eyebrows <SPARKLES>
Shout out to me for looking better and more in charge of my life than I did last year even though all I learned how to do was contour
Sleep is ideal but will it actually happen is the question
Lolololololololol
@lesleynazario right?? It's so stupid like okay obviously you know more about me than me thnx
@alex_stolte @blackbeanqueen @erinmaglietta @TheHottieTaylor I can't handle this
I need cake more than I need anything else right now.
Uhm. 
In Da Club by 50 cent started playing from my phone in the middle of a lecture in class so I'm officially ready to die
Why do I have to entertain the curiosity about if I'm being genuine when I say I'm Hispanic to people? Like why would I lie about that??????
I changed my part to go with the stronger side of my makeup today 
Today is so doodoo
Hey Rowan you should find workers who don't sexually harass your students while they're on their way to class
I had an anxiety attack over my eye liner this morning but I guess it was worth it because I look nice
I think I'll watch Scooby Doo until I fall asleep tonight
Maybe I shouldn't say anything anymore since more people seem to like me that way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Lol regretting my status cause it might've been too aggressive <THUMBS UP SIGN>
All I need are nachos and a back rub tbh
This is @erinmaglietta and I sharing a burrito further proving we are the gayest not gay couple ever tbh 
@sjd1192 I'll take your abs if you don't want them <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
The problem is that we've been forced to believe that sharing the same space is equality at its peak.
In grade school we were taught racism no longer existed simply because we shared the same classroom.
cat feet are the cutest feet
@ecosystem_face @erinmaglietta that one was kinda anilame, alex
@blackbeanqueen I literally lol'd at this
Also crazy how POC are portrayed as animals period. It's dehumanizing, but it's okay as long as everyone knows someone's windows are broken.
The way the media covers black riots is the same way they cover animal attacks. They won't tell you what caused it but will make you afraid.
Black deaths only get coverage when they've caused black riots but it's never to inform rather to instill &amp; perpetuate fear
*Low key trying to pass on progressive ideals and stances to younger siblings while still being the chill cool older sister *
You get what you give, so if you give nothing you'll probably get nothing tbh
@cschill23 you look super cute!!
I hope Rowan can pay for my dentures cause I'm going to lose my teeth eating their hard rice
It got better 
Lol listening to Jonas Brothers Radio while working because I'm trash and this came on further proving I'm trash 
@erinmaglietta *ways to get me to never leave the house
Sweet, dude who sent me a creepy DM has passed by my class door 4 times looking directly at me each time
I really don't feel like going to class now
The best part of the dream was that people saw it but didn't acknowledge it or care so I was laying there bleeding with no help ~symbolism~
Tfw you have a dream that someone you know stabs you for not being invited to your party thus making you actually terrified
I got up from laying in one place to lay in another <OK HAND SIGN>
<SPARKLES> lol I'm a dick <SPARKLES>
This isn't going to work out Steven. 
Someone tell me what the quality craft beers are so I can pretend to like them and know what I'm talking about
@blackbeanqueen maybe! If I can pick myself up out this comfy couch
@blackbeanqueen @MasonJoody lol I'm such a pleb that I had to google what it was so you're good
Trying not to take this personally but it's so very personal
@blackbeanqueen honestly though I think things like okcupid and tinder will still be useful for the most part and help from new friends too<THUMBS UP SIGN>
Remember that thing you thought I didn't notice? I noticed it, be nervous.
@blackbeanqueen they don't they just marry the next person they see and have a baby the next day I think
People farting unexpectedly and loudly in public places will never not make me laugh like a 5 year old tbh
LOL SOMEONE TOOK THE SOCKS I ACCIDENTALLY LEFT IN THE BATHROOM
@ryleejacobs ew no y
For example: today I said I wanted a medium large iced hot coffee...wat
Ordering food out loud is a lot more troubling to me than it should be
Munchies are the holy grail of snacks
Every single time I wear these shoes I get a blister on my heel and have to take them off and go barefoot before the day is over wtf
If this isn't the cutest thing you've seen all day 
Sometimes I remember that someone I don't know thinks that I think they're the love of my life because of what someone else told them lol <SKULL>
<SPARKLES> lol people suck <SPARKLES>
@alex_stolte get one that says "follow ur dreams" backwards so you can be inspired everyday when you look in the mirror
The ambulance is here do you think I can get them to give me a ride home so I can change?
One time my boss told me he once found an account he forgot he made with $35,000 in it after I told him how I found $5 in my pants that day
I wore a really stupid jeans and crop top combination today but there is nothing I can do about it so my gut is going to be out until 6
At this point I just use my tinder to get a thumb exercise and call out boys on their shit
My goal is to be successful enough where people ask me to speak at their graduations and I say no because I'll still probably have anxiety
Strapless bra aka I was wearing a bra but now it's around my waist
"When a person tells you that you hurt them you don't get to decide that you didn't"
@Honeymustardbby thank you girl
Honestly, I can't wait to be a mother. I don't care how stereotypical or lame it sounds. My family is going to be so rad.
I had a dream I had the cutest baby girl and now I'm having serious withdrawals like it was real
I just accidentally googled "DIY septum piercing" and it left me so confused that now don't even remember what I meant to search

maybe if eat a lot of strawberries and do some yoga tomorrow it'll make up for the fact that I pulled an all nighter and drank monster #bleh
I can hear an actual owl outside my window rn, is this a sign of good luck with the rest of my last semester or some type of Rowan omen??

You're a sad collection of stealing moments and making everything about you when you're threatened with lack of attention. Selfish. Bye.
My mind is racing around like 30 thoughts at once so trying to finish these assignments is going to be interesting
It's interesting how things only become relevant to people when it's relevant to them, but it's not even a thought when it's not about them
Today was the first time I was ever someone's wcw and I didn't even have to force them so there's that <THUMBS UP SIGN>

@bvanderhorn woooooooh!!!!
Today was a doozy so I'm going to watch Bob's Burgers and maybe eat two personal pizzas
I think about that all the time. It sucks. I'm pretty sure teachers are supposed to inspire and motivate not leave behind intense self-doubt
Remember that time multiple teachers told me that I'm only capable of being okay at many things but can never be really good at anything <THUMBS UP SIGN>
for someone in communications, I sure suck at forced conversations 
Rowan sends an email about the network being down yet they have access to send the email... 
I normally wouldn't think men literally speed walking away from me is a good thing, but it makes me feel superior so run little baby run

It begs the question of what is the line between looking for another's support and running from our own. Who knows maybe it's all blurred.
Like we all do it. It's like an assembly line of repetition and advice to avoid our own answers and solutions
I wonder if there is an average for the amount of people we talk about a problem before we realize its in our own power to address &amp; change

Member that time my doctor told me I was letting him down because I have the body &amp; heartrate of an athlete but no motivation for that life
Have you ever freaked yourself out about conversations people have had about you to people you don't know; changing their impression of you
@SymoneSalib so the question is are you more of an Ilana or an Abbi?
@Sophiaadrianna It's super necessary, also helps keep you grounded a little.
I don't get what the appeal of not keeping up with current events is. I get it's hard to swallow and annoying sometimes, but really
Hey friends, it's *Sophia not Sofia, but thank you for the overwhelming support and apologies of not showing up to a show I didn't play!
Dear Timothy Olyphant, i'm ready when u r
It's funny how people treat you once they got what they wanted from you
Is peace of mind even achievable or is that a myth to keep people quiet about how life is really crappy sometimes?
@SymoneSalib I don't know the context of this but it fits so well with my mood too
You literally make me physically ill.
I'm changing my Twitter name if anyone cares so don't @ the wrong thing. There is also a 97% chance that it'll be stupid

just read old notes and now my heart hurts. time for bed
tfw you realize you are Dad af
I met the baby and she gave me a wink when I accidentally called her babe<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>I'm sure it was just a coincidence but also we're best friends now
My sister's cat is super offended that no one is paying attention to her now that the baby is here so she walking around hissing and whining
I need to stop seeing people who've cut their hair short because it's only making me want to do it again
Late night Tindering where the compliments get real weird 
American Horror Story: Tinder Messages
American Horror Story: "Aww don't I get a hug?"
There is yelling and cursing happening in the street outside and I'm scared the purge was approved without my knowledge
There was a short stint in high school when I went by the last name Stone because of a character in a show I had a crush on...#neverforget
*is most def too proud to beg
my swipe right to swipe left ratio increases when I am bored and alone.
I just remembered that I'm not wearing an actual bra but a headscarf wrapped like a bandeau top because I was waiting for my bras to dry <VICTORY HAND>️<SPARKLES>
Oreos with peanut butter give me so much life
If it is Pi day and I have no pie is it actually Pi day?
@erinmaglietta 2 hungry 2 function
worse we only measure people's personal worth based on how high they measure ours. I only see highly of you because of how highly you see me
We all want to be recognized for our worth yet we never recognize anyone else's worth, that's why selfishness and pain spread like wild fire
I also need a chocolate milkshake in the worst way right now
I need hashbrowns and an omelette in the worst way right now
A photograph of mine was chosen to be used for a showcasing event and I'm getting paid for it???? <DANCER><SPARKLES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Walking like I'm drunk until I can get far enough from the school to take my shoes off and look even more drunk
Would it be weird if I walked home barefoot because my feet hurt and I can't walk in these shoes anymore
I'm currently watching a youtube video about the 15 biggest unsolved mysteries in the world narrated by an Australian dude. What is my life.
Also Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne look like they can be related which made it kinda awk at times.
The Theory of Everything is very good and also very sad
I relate to this on a spiritual level 
queen of getting too much food but being too embarrassed to admit it
Trying very hard to make 2 hours of sleep work 
All I'm asking are for high waisted pants/jeans long enough to fit girls over 5'5
My overall mood today is Lucille from Arrested Development 
":P" 
"We should hang out" 
"You look so much better without your glasses" 
I can't tell if my professor is staring at me because my outfit is cute and similar to hers or because she doesn't like me and read my tweet
I'm not cool with professors who lecture after their class just took an exam.
This might be extreme, but I strongly believe almond milk is the best thing that ever happened to me. I need it my life again
When is a restaurant going to have another free food day? I'm tryna eat for free tbh
anxious about today -&gt; coffee to stay up -&gt; coffee = anxiety -&gt; anxious about anxiety -&gt; tea to calm down -&gt; caffeinated tea = anxiety
not sleeping the entire night before your busiest day is v not fun. 0/10 stars would not recommend
tfw you have such a bomb title &amp; opening paragraph that you don't care how the rest of the paper goes cause you're sure you already got an A
@JFBerenato  hmm point taken
Is there something about me that says "your first message to me online should definitely be about our babies and/or marriage" cuz like...no
Rowan sent me an email only addressing me by my last name...I didn't know Sue Sylvester left Glee.
This idea that men aren't capable of love is whack. Stop making excuses for being a dick &amp; being afraid of expressing a normal human feeling
@Maeve_17 this joke was A+ and very quality so I cannot be mad <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
The whole argument between "sub" and "hoagie" is so stupid, just call it a sandwich.
*goes on 8 mile hike and is completely fine. Wears chunky heeled boots for a few hours and legs are jelly.
I have an ass that won't quit mainly because it never started and you can't quit something you never started.
I find comfort in knowing that if I die young everyone would have a piece of me because I shed like a dog &amp; my hair is literally everywhere
catch me in your local university trying to study but looking up dip recipes instead.
I just remembered I had a dream about how much I loved bacon and kept screaming "BAECON" at everyone because I thought I was being clever.
My memory has been horrible lately and I'm starting to be concerned but I forget why.
I think my drawing professor finally found out that I'm untalented and now doesn't like me anymore haha
Actually everything by Daughter is really good.
Home by Daughter is so good.
Good Morning :) Here's a cute dog 
I wonder what emojis people have with my contact info
Girls are becoming more and more aware of boys' shit and feeling less and less inclined to put up with it. It's a beautiful thing to witness
@heyjessej I just got out of my astronomy class and I feel this tweet on a cosmic level (pun intended)
I know "let's get weird" is a workaholics reference but whenever I see it on a boys Tinder I am certain he's lowkey asking for butt stuff <VICTORY HAND>️
I wonder if babies know how rad they are
@blackbeanqueen my future tbh
I've never given up on my childhood dream of having a sunny fun montage to Perfect Day by Hoku
No one ever wants to admit how we all get sucked into Buzzfeed the same way no one admits we all know the lyrics to Rockstar by Nickelback
teacher sends class an email about an activity planned for tonight, first thought is "I hope it's not physical"
I actually get very offended when I'm at a karaoke place and they don't have any Nicki Minaj songs. <WAVING HAND SIGN>
Is this real life or nah? Cause I have no chill rn @AvaGordy 
To be annoying and always bother people with my life in order to be friends or not talk to them except when someone else initiates it
My aesthetic: annoying and always hungry
*stops trying only making it worse and harder to make friends
*thinks everyone hates her so doesn't ever really connect with anyone
being everyone's Plan B is getting realllll old
leave me alone Kate Upton I don't  want to play that stupid game
my head hurts, my socks are soaked, and my back is killing me BUT it was such a beautiful day for an awesome hike with awesome people
Am I considered an official photographer if people use my pictures for their tinder profiles? <DANCER><INFORMATION DESK PERSON><SPARKLES>
@SymoneSalib you guys breathe life into me with your hotness OMG
I am so hyped to hang out with baby Mia all spring break for reals.
I also don't feel like being in Glassboro anymore. I can't wait to go home.
I wish it weren't so dark and cold outside. over winter.
tfw you accidentally forget to includes clothes from the pile that already is separated and in the wash
I'm over it.
I am so proud of my sister, my god she is so fantastic and strong and lovely. I cannot handle my emotions. She will be an awesome mother
i'm seriously crying so hard right now, I am so happy. Is this normal? Who cares I am an aunt
I AM OFFICALLY AN AUNT! HOLY POOP I AM SO EXCITED! I JUST CRIED!! I'M STILL CYRING!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER!
I really can't believe I forgot to take part in #blackoutday I was so excited, but shout out to all the beautiful black people who did! SLAY
My thirst for food always surpasses my thirst for boys and that may be why I'm single.
@erinmaglietta life ruiner. That's what this is. 
I want diner food without diner food prices because diner food prices are a rip off
I need an omelette in my life so badly right now.
@erinmaglietta @sweeney_n we are here in line are you still here Nora?
when you're starting to spiral downward in sadness again but remember you're cohosting a party 
That hurt.
I'm turning into that person who says "wine if I'm feelin fine and whiskey if I'm feelin frisky" and I'm not too bothered by it
WHY DOES MY STOMACH HURT I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING
if we're friends and you don't swipe right for me on tinder I will be very offended not cause I want anything with you but because I am cute
@Radio1045 so did the 2pm - 3pm chance to win @MumfordAndSons passes not happen yet or am I prematurely losing my hearing??
something in the universe doesn't want me to be stylish and happy because now they're completely sold out again. brb crying for eternity
Now that classes are officially cancelled, the snow can stop and it can be warm again and spring can happen please.
I didn't know how much I lived for @RachLWhitehurst 's cats updates until my heart palpitated looking at the new one just now.
shopping at ASOS is like the cornucopia from the Hunger Games. Giving me all kinds of stress. I just want my chelsea boots.
I hope everyone enjoys my and @erinmaglietta 's friendship online because it's just as super cheesy and cute irl too
@erinmaglietta coke, blue, and red *and if they have coconut that
@erinmaglietta fkin slurpee... and maybe a brownie
@erinmaglietta Spiritually, metaphorically, and literally
@erinmaglietta I feel you
@erinmaglietta come back booboo we shall make some soup and go to our respective spaces until we want human interaction again
FINALLY #thanksRowan
Hey @ASOS_HeretoHelp you guys sent me the wrong size, can you send me the right one instead of a refund before they sell out?
I thought I'd be happy today because I finally got my chelsea boots but THEY SENT ME THE WRONG SIZE
If everyone keeps tweeting at and about Rowan they'll cancel classes because they put their reputation above our safety tbh
Besides me being a lazy piece of shit, if all roads leading to Rowan are dangerous and unsafe to drive on they really need to close.
You wanna tell me how Glassboro public schools are closed but ROWAN which is in Glassboro isn't closed yet????
What the shit Rowan, close already
Hallelujah my morning class and exam is cancelled so that means I can sleep and write the paper I wouldn't have had time to write<VICTORY HAND>️<RELIEVED FACE><VICTORY HAND>️<SPARKLES>
So New Jersey is basically shutting down but all we have in Glassboro is some rain?
Got so hyped when I saw that text and email only to realize it's not for Rowan's main campus <UNAMUSED FACE>

@jodidziedzic i know...i felt it.
.@GovChristie so should I do my homework or nah?
I don't actually know how the weather is until I read a tweet about it then decide I'm going to look outside for the first time in hours
*Patiently waits to be someone's wcw 
My body is definitely paying me back for something. maybe stress. maybe all the fast food I've had recently.
I just want to make spaghetti and monkey bread for my friends
I live in the constant fear that I am going to see a professor on tinder
How did it even come to this? This is giving me so much anxiety 
There isn't a time when I don't want cake tbh
My head feels like a 14 wheeler is doing donuts on it
this winter has been a composition of me trying not to look like the exhausted lazy piece of shit I may or may not be.
don't dream about guys, dream about bomb ass breakfast foods
i think dreaming about a boy is basically a warning from your brain that you're about to catch feelings and that you need to not
dreaming about cheddar bagel breakfast sandwiches
Whenever I think I have options life is like "nah."
I need my chelsea boots to get here already so I can wear my leather leggings with them and feel like a badass
I feel very weird right now
I wish I had a rich relative who chose to treat me like the child they never had
drastically going to change my hair again bc boredom maybe
can I slow down bad blood and make it more somber and chilling? cause ima try
someone give me good angry songs to cover and mess up my voice with. I'm in the mood to give a musical middle finger
LOVE BEING LEFT OUT OF PLANS THANK YOU LOVE YOU 2
every week I feel differently about waking up early for this class. This week I am not feeling it.
I woke up thinking about dinner. That's how hungry I've been today. That is how my day is going.
(unless for religious, moral, and/or dietary reasons)
Life is too short to not enjoy bacon wrapped foods
@itsjennnnyall still relevant tho
All classes would be better if the professors brought food. #justsaying
I will never understand why the media goes crazy when a celebrity changes their hair &amp; make polls about it. It's not your hair, get over it.
Everyone deserves Mia's closet in The Princess Diaries 2
if you're not going to take the time to talk to someone or get to know them, it's insulting of you to think you've got them figured out
why is humming or singing to yourself out loud considered weird? I think it's so soft and sweet.
When I get back home I am going to take the best longest bubble bath and wash away negative vibes by sitting in my own filth
deleting rants because I'm sure everyone is tired of me being upset
when friends become friends with rude people lol
priorities
is there a proper way to start a conversation with someone you met while intoxicated?
(last tweet was a joke, not a sad boy)
every time I watch youtube makeup tutorials, I look up the prices of the makeup they use and decide I am okay with being ugly
ahhhhhhhhh it all makes sense nowwwwww
I took a sober sip of the remnants of a drink I made for myself when I was drunk and it tasted like acetone mixed with cherry cough syrup
*asks "What?" for the 5th time because she didn't hear you for the 5th time then pretends she heard you and just smiles and nods
I'm going to start speaking in only Spice Girls lyrics
I'm bored and on health house arrest so naturally I'm going to Harriet the spy people and piece together stories
I can't breathe. Asthma sucks ass
I need to stop expecting things because people only let you down
with that thought, I still feel guilty for shopping today
Being broke forces you to know how to budget your money.
*cracks knuckles* how should I change my hair this month?
I'M SO TIRED OF THE DRESS DEBATE AND PEOPLE COMPLAINING/JOKING ABOUT THE DRESS DEBATE
@amymcanal you are so beautiful and brilliant Amanda
@amymcanal you are no duff, you are a beautiful fierce ass rad chick!
it only takes Beyonce 45 minutes to get dressed so keep that in mind the next time you're getting ready.
the hell is happening to my body
I am so saddened by the news of Leonard Nimoy. He was such a brilliant and talented human being. He indeed live long and prosper. Rest easy
@jodidziedzic I've wanted to try meditating, but I have no clue how or where to start
I'm really concerned with weird I'm feeling right now.
i feel super weird and physically distant from myself. I probably should get more rest or something
Nick Bateman. Excuse me.
if only someone loved me as much as I love dogs

I think my grandma and grandpa have a competition on who can comment on my profile pictures first
Update on my quest for Chelsea boots: good news is I found some that were cute and on sale. bad news is that they're sending it home home
I love how companies and businesses use the term "invoice" like bitch I know it's a bill, let's not sugarcoat it.
*only checks rowan announcer to see when and where there will be free food
I seriously can't wait until winter is over so we don't have to keep paying crazy ass gas bills.
Looking tired for a living

@ryleejacobs love you too <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Sophia: the girl who's parties I go to
it's like high school all over again!
I am really not feeling how replaceable/ invisible/ ignored I've been feeling lately, but then again no one notices lololol
lol @ how people who have been to a party at my house and met me pretend I don't exist. Thanks see you at the next one!
is Polyvore still a thing? Can I still create outfits ideas with pieces I can't afford?
when you can tell that you're meaning less and less to someone.
@blackbeanqueen I'm sorry, babe. I'm here if you need me!
checking a privilege isn't the dismissal of issues but the practice of humility
the best thing bout this morning class are the free bagels and my cutey patooty professor
My heart cannot handle handsome men in button downs
who even has the money for spontaneous out of country trips? like there really are people who have extra money? Damn i'm jealous
let's play the game of do you only like me because of someone else or even better only liked me because someone else was unavailable woooooh
@blackbeanqueen let's reschedule!
Pushing people away by being detached and emotionless since '93
I really want landmark's nachos but I'm not about going out in the cold just for them, so it's time they start delivering
@ryleejacobs I love you lmao &lt;3
adulthood is deciding whether you should spend money on those new glasses you need, that bill you should've paid, or a better winter coat
and like that my first and only refund check is gone
it really makes me happy how supportive and helpful parents are with my film career. Shout out to them for real
I've got candles and string lights on in my room. It's a very romantic set up to be alone without pants on watching Netflix and not doing hw
I can't tell if I am genuinely not interesting enough or if some people are just really bad at holding conversations...maybe both
So you tell me I'm not enough, act as if I don't exist, and unfollow me on everything, but still want me to be a LinkedIn connection?????? <RAISED HAND>
@erinmaglietta It only took 4 years, but I'm finally starting to rub off on you. WELCOME TO THE CLUB
@SymoneSalib Sofia Coppola and Francis Ford Coppola
it all boils down to repressed insecurity and unnecessary need for competition. That's all for this rant. Same old same old. Blah Blah
be original in your lack of originality sometimes. Don't act like the sun shines out of your ass and that you're doing something "first"
nothing is actually original, so why claim and act as if you've paved new grounds? embrace renovation and where you got your inspiration
lol @ peeing on concepts/ideas just to say they did it first. mostly for gratification from others for their "originality".
for once I want to not worry about paying bills and not feel guilty for spending money on myself.
what witch doctor have I pissed off recently?
let's also talk about how this bb cream, which is supposed to be lighter and better for my skin is making me break out in hives
What the actual heck. I am so pissed. A year. A YEAR.
I've wanted these flat black chelsea boots for a YEAR and now that I finally have the spare money for them what happens? they discontinue it
I have the illest craving for fried chicken but Crown doesn't deliver <WEARY FACE>
this is why I am torn between dark hair and blonde hair 
I hope the boys who came to look at the house enjoyed the view of the red lacy thong that I just noticed was on top of my pile of laundry <SPARKLES><DANCER>
That French class I took paid off because now I know what that girl is saying in Partition
how many people would hate me if I covered an old skool jobros song? I'm not trying to lose friends and/or potential relationships over this
Jason Momoa makes me feel all types of things...like hot primal fantasy types of things
How am I expected to decode clues about what someone really means or wants when I can't even figure out what I really mean or want????????
I don't think I can even explain how much of a Jonas Brothers stan I was when I was younger. I'm getting so nostalgic listening to them rn
BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS DANCE
Does anyone remember Vanessa Hudgen's song Sneaker Night?????
*stands outside your window with a boombox and romantically plays "I Don't Fuck With You"
real talk my best quality is my Netflix list
does anyone actually enjoy the surprise of not knowing your nose is running until it's too late or are we all suffering in silence together?
Turn ons: liking me back
I haven't pet nearly as much animals as I should've this month
I almost forgot how I literally ran out of a room to avoid someone I already saw and made eye contact with today lol
doody dude bro krappa krap krappers
I would retweet my jokes, but you can't retweet yourself, so you guys are just going to have to like and accept me the first time around.
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> I'm too cold. Cold damn. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@jodidziedzic don't forget a picture of Ron Swanson
I wish it weren't cold so I wasn't stuck on campus.
People who say that there isn't a point of apologizing because it won't erase what they did as an excuse to not say sorry are lame. <SLEEPY FACE>
.@erinmaglietta left me chocolate at work, now that's what I call true love...uhh I mean friendship <WINKING FACE>
I almost went this entire winter without losing a glove...almost
everytime I go back to okcupid I hope to not get gross messages that make me delete it again but then I delete it again
never underestimate the power of thirst, we call this phenomena "cute boy syndrome"
my role is also to say 'I told you so' when no one listens to me
my character role in D&amp;D is basically just to tell everyone that something is a trap
I need a back rub in the worst way
@blackbeanqueen I tried lavender last semester and it ended up hella grey/not lavender
should I stay a blonde or nah?
@erinmaglietta that's basically all I want to be good for in life tbh
I can't wait to meet my niece !!! I'm officially going to be the ~ cool aunt ~
@SymoneSalib @erinmaglietta I don't run anymore after the surgery
I just witnessed @erinmaglietta realize she tweeted that she was a dwarf in d&amp;d when she is actually a gnome &amp; now I regret being her friend
@erinmaglietta we have rice cakes and cheese at home
One person can't define your worth but that doesn't stop them from trying
my dreams lately have been simple in such a realistic way, that it is almost painful waking up and realizing that even that it isn't real.
I'm not even sure what 3-5 inches of snow is anymore.
@erinmaglietta I JUST WANT TO BE LIKED AND ACCEPTED FOR MY HUMOR ERIN.
cops: 911 what's ur emergency?
Me: my friends r missing

someone please send me north jersey/new york bagels please.
I want a snow day minus the actual snow
thank you to everyone who has come into my life &amp; helped me make those baby steps big leaps forward even with just a laugh. I love you all<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I have met such wonderful beautiful brilliant people that made going through that hell very much worth it because it lead me right to them<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I'm being really reflective/mushy but this time last year I felt very sad and very alone
Everyone needs to understand how important @SymoneSalib is, I'm so happy to have her in my life holy shit whatta wonderful person srsly!! <SPARKLES><SPARKLES>
God only knows why it took us so long to actually become friends, but I am so thankful that this… 
Let's just all make it a point to stop putting unnecessary selfishness and negativity into the world
Our biggest fears are that we are exactly like the people we hate
someone gets a little bit of attention and it threatens you so you run to as many people as you can for reassurance and gratification
Jealousy is not a cute or endearing trait
Not a fan of feeling guilty for stupid shit
Whoa nerves
I really want to go outside and take pictures but I also don't want to freeze my ass off so
@ryleejacobs I'll post them soon!!
When you keep trying to tell a story but everyone keeps interrupting you 
I need menisnsim because an woman never shovel snow but always sing "the cold nerve bothered me anyway" #meninism
Glassboro really needs to open up a Spanish food joint because I'm really craving empanadas but also really don't feel like making it myself
@SymoneSalib <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@jodidziedzic my wish came true! 
my talents include fixing things and misquoting movies and videos
forever stuck between "I want to talk to you" and "but I don't want to seem annoying"
@blackbeanqueen no you looked really hot and your hair and eyebrows are magnificently on point always
@ryleejacobs husshhhhh
my valentine's day wish is for @jodidziedzic to follow me on twitter
You can catch me at your local party changing the songs and awkwardly standing around trying to start a conversation but not knowing how to
@erinmaglietta @sweeney_n I second this statement so much
I'm so happy everyone enjoyed my Dog Days are Over song pun on the cat party playlist last night and also how many people love that song too
@ryleejacobs You guys are so hot omg
@BrandonStJeanos FEEL BETTER!
“Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made.”

Timothy Olyphant is such a dilf
Taylor Swift is actually dreamy perfection. How do I sign up for whatever she's been doing?
@heyjessej Congrats babe!!!!
@ryleejacobs @erinmaglietta Yeahhhhh I think it was for the whit? if not I have no clue it woulda been smart to ask
@SymoneSalib you have every right to eat all of them though! I would just be selfish
@SymoneSalib I would but you know that I would eat all of them
@SymoneSalib stop being so dang cute symone
<DANCER> accidentally thought too much <DANCER>
*facebook tells everyone when you were last on mobile*
I need a black leather jacket
@SymoneSalib  it's a date ;)
I'm very tired of having to prove that I am worth it to people who have already laid down their opinions of me.
@SymoneSalib WHAT SHOULD IT SAY???? WHY SHOULD WE WIN???? SHOULD I SAY BECAUSE I'M RAD OR BECAUSE I WANT TO PROPOSE TO HOZIER???
Neither of those<DANCER><DANCER><DANCER><DANCER>
Repressing or genuinely over it?? Who knows???????? <DANCER>
in need of a city trip
Thank you universe for being very kind to me <VICTORY HAND>️
My favorite pass time is staining people's faces with red lipstick to claim them
Tall chick who sneezes like a bunny
@dylanweiss666 how do you even mix up knife and finger tho ??????
I want to live in and experience so many different places it makes my bones ache
I'm torn between living in a cabin near a mountain or a cute apartment in the city or a cottage in Ireland or a little house in France
@ddlovato if wearing a lot of makeup makes them happy/comfortable with themselves than there is no shame in that :) why make them feel bad?
*new turn on 
Ugh chills 
People can be such selfish shitheads thnx 4 that
a big part of me was hoping for a different message when I turned on my phone
I had such a lovely time with lovely people
Cheers to friends and family friends <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Everyone take the time to look at the moon because it's doing very cute things right now
Thanks Rowan for triggering my anxiety
I'm actually freaking out.
Expected to get paid today after struggling with no food and money for 2 weeks only to have the check be pushed back another 2 weeks
But it's also not the center of life
Being an empowered woman does not equal not wanting a solid relationship
There isn't a "perfect" time for anything. Time doesn't adjust/stop just because you don't think you're ready. Moving forward isn't optional
If we're going to take a trip back to 2007, maybe get The Maine or Panic at the Disco or the Jonas Brothers, or anything else actually
I would feel sick the night before my busiest day of the week where staying at home isn't an option.
@riffrafflove oh no! if they weren't swiping IDs it'd be totally sweeeeet, but I'm wrapped up in my blankets working on homework anyway lol
@riffrafflove wait April do you go to Rowan?
maybe a chore board isn't such a bad idea in retrospect
is it worth treking back to campus at night alone for sex toy bingo?
It's beautiful outside today!
@SymoneSalib I've been trying all week, we got this girl <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
@jodidziedzic IS THIS ABOUT ME?? IF SO THANK YOUUUUUUUUU YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL (if it's not for me you're still beautiful)
Embrace the messy hair days 
I've been sitting on three songs I want to cover but haven't actually mustered up the courage to actually do them
My professor brought us bagels this morning. I don't think I've loved a woman as much as I do now.(sorry mom)
It's supposed to be super cold today so if you have the resources (hat, scarf, gloves, warm coat) it's v important to layer up!<SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW>️
Will love anyone who gets me a chocolate milkshake right now
I have to be really aggressive with the text on my alarms or future Sophia won't actually get up.
Ive had such a sweet tooth lately all I want is cake 24/7
I think I should start taking pictures of my clothing items so I can pick what I'm going to wear without leaving the bed or freaking out
Not everything is a competition. The most fulfilling things are done from a place where the pressure to get more attention doesn't exist
Some people are so self focused that they think your own personal success is a direct attack against them. So they fire back from insecurity
ROSS IS A FUCKBOY RACHEL RUN FAR FAR AWAY
I'm starting Friends again so if you don't hear from me for a while that is why.
So like can I get paid the same amount as a pro football player just for being a decent human being or is that not how America works?
I think I'm really pumping out good super bowl tweets for someone who did not watch the super bowl
@sweeney_n there it is! There is the money joke, you've got a future kid
The most important thing about this game is nothing because Beyonce didn't make a surprise appearance so nothing really matters
Has anyone made a joke about the Patriots cheating in like correlation to American history and stuff?
Do you think it's easy to pants football players during a game? Asking for a friend
@SymoneSalib that sounds like a challenge...I'll be right over
I'm not even watching the Super Bowl I have no idea what's going on
They should just make the Super Bowl a giant Beyonce concert where the footballers twerk in the background
Honestly they should just have Beyonce do every half time show ever. They might as well have her perform the entire thing actually.
The best thing about the Super Bowl are the puppies and food. Guess what I have? NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS
I'm really insulted by how many times today Netflix has stopped to ask me if I'm still watching this show

Especially in towns like Glassboro. I really just wanna go on a road trip is what I'm getting at but I only have a bike

Look at my cute boots in the snow. I went outside without a jacket for this basic pic

Other people's lives don't revolve around your personal comfort/discomfort, once you realize this you'll stop feeling "hurt" by small things
for every 1 rad ass chick there are like 15 fuckboys and this is why it's hard to date
@blackbeanqueen Yesss plzzz
I want new conversations, road trips, tall buildings, dive bars, huge trees, starry skies, subway platforms. I want life so badly right now.
Watching Broad City all day made me come to the conclusion that I am tired of routines and miss New York.

The one thing the world needs less of is things left up in the air and simple solutions that are avoided because no one says what's needed
Say what's on your mind. Life is too short to leave things up in the air.
it may because I'm in communications, but I think expressing yourself is so crucial. Intentions, interests, hard words, easy words. Speak.
All that is certain is that we have our words so if you hide behind silence for fear of the one thing you are granted you are a coward..

Passive aggressiveness never solved anything, my sophomore and junior year roommate should've taught me that
I guess, I'm just going about it the wrong way
But at the same time it'd be nice to be asked what's wrong rather than casually ignored.
Passive aggressive silence is the worse way to handle things when it's silence itself that hurt you in the first place

There goes that pain in my chest again
Uhm. 
I really don't want to be here right now.
I wish this were something I could just brush off, but this type of pain runs so sharp and deep.
I'm really sad now. This sucks/hurts.
@blackbeanqueen I hate it when ppl argue it's the same as preferred hair color or weight. Those things, to a certain extent, can be changed
That hurts so much, especially being on the receiving end. Because that is beyond my abilities to change. It's more than just a preference.
And that every single person in that race must be alike and look alike, so much so that no one, not one person in that large group is enough
What you're saying is that based off of person's skin color, that you won't date them.
It really hurts when people rope a whole entire race into a "won't date" category but then stand against racism.
thnx for making me mad again lol you win <PARTY POPPER><CONFETTI BALL>

like whyyyyy thoooo. stttttop trying to be something you're notttttttt.
I hate having to break bills because then I feel broke again
My New Years resolution is to stop having to remind myself every month that bangs are do not suit me.
that being said it's probably because I dropped on concrete tiles and in a toilet so really it's only my fault
if anyone has tried texting me, my phone has adopted a new rebellious persona and only works when it wants to
Or shots
I could really use a hug right now
People who make their mcm their boyfriend EVERY SINGLE WEEK actually need to chill like really no one else? Idris Elba? Chris Pratt? No one?
I packed a juice pouch for lunch today because I am an adult who is trying to hold on to her youth
High anxiety and coffee equals twitchy eye Sophia
Maybe I should just hire a photographer to follow me around and take pictures of me when I do cute things or look decent
How do you get people to take pics of you while you're out without seeming like a self-focused piece of shit or killing the moment?

@SymoneSalib @erinmaglietta already ahead of you except instead of making cookies &amp; drinking at night I'm day drinking alone &amp; doing laundry
Imagine the good self focused people could do if they took all that attention they place on themselves &amp; turned it into genuine compassion
This week is awful mentally, physically, literally, metaphorically. I just want to not feel like shit
Accidentally set my alarm for 9:00 PM instead of AM. So today is starting off great.
"no."
@amymcanal making use of that fox pic is my specialty
When someone takes a candid picture of you and you didn't actually know you were that ugly 
Today's look is the "I didn't have time to shower this morning so I'm wearing a hat instead" asethetic
Ha
You know when you have that unnerving feeling in your stomach like there is something you don't know, again?
I created a playlist called chill down to work to and instead I'm thinking of stupid cutesy scenarios and montages

And puppies. I am so about puppies.
I'm about good vibes, using your voice for good and honorable things, themed parties, and dancing away your stress during finals week.
I don't hate you because your beliefs don't comply with mine, that way of thinking is what keeps us in the dark to begin with. Spread love.

My head is killing me. Stressed, hungry, stressed

“Stop giving people power to control your smile, your worth, and your attitude.”
Prepared a glass (mug) of wine for myself because I'm stressed af and need to chill but I'm too busy to even actually drink from it.
I am so FRUSTRATED.

@SymoneSalib it's okay booboo you will do great and it'll all be over soon!
Dear Sophia, stop talking. Love, Sophia.
The girl sitting next to me just blew her nose into her hand and wiped it into her hair but I get it cause this week is hell for everyone
I really didn't need that today.
I've got two cans of tuna, a few boxes of Mac and cheese, and packet of bacon do you think that's enough to make gingerbread cookies?
I just want hot chocolate and some cookies tbh

@blackbeanqueen ;*
@blackbeanqueen OH NO!! I'm sorry, girl!!
Stop perpetuating silence for white comfort. If injustice makes you feel bad stand the fuck up and open your mouth. Don't stay silent
If you don't stand for what you believe in you'll fall with what you don't
Hey did you know that staying quiet and choosing not to talk about an issue doesn't actually get rid of the issue or support the cause
.@symonesalib you or nah? 
My aesthetic today 
I don't think I've ever used a push down sink that stayed down long enough for me to successfully wash my hands without pressing it 50 times
shout out to @SymoneSalib for introducing me to PHOX!! I can't get enough of her voice

@Sophiaadrianna *baguette
I'm drinking red wine, eating a baquette, and working on a script. I am the epitome of a hipster right now.
Death by overthinking
boys are super lame-o 5000
all I wanted was some turkey tbh
You haven't experienced frustration until you try detangling really curly hair
i need a hedgehog like wth why are they so cute??
there's something satisfying about meanspirited people failing to get the attention they're desperate for &amp; whining about it like big babies
@erinmaglietta lol *spent all of that paycheck on gas and shirts* but yesss
@erinmaglietta Same, Panera date soon?
Desperate for bread
Like for real there is a movie on right now about two people being brought together by their cats. THIS IS MY TYPE OF MOVIE
i'm not even gonna lie, I love the cheesy christmas love story movies on hallmark
And stop  throwing around the terms like OCD, Bipolar, and Anorexic amongst many for unrelated non-illness things. It's v not cool.
Like please please please don't talk excessively about you gaining or losing weight to someone who suffers from an eating disorder.
Can we all just remember how super important is it to watch what you say to people who suffer from mental illnesses.
post thanksgiving not okayness
if someone mentions something about them &amp; the first thing you do is make a response about yourself you need to reevaluate yourself big time
@erinmaglietta 
@blackbeanqueen I'm thankful that you exist too you beautiful goddess you <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Thankful for my makeup today cause this doesn't happen often 
I finally got to see her belly! So cute <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Pregnant women are so adorable seriously omg
MY SISTER IS SO CUTE I CANT HANDLE IT
I'm NOT thankful for fuckboys but that I am able to sniff one out a mile away now
I'm thankful for puppies and kittens and baby animals
I'm thankful for my height and always being able to reach the highest shelf.
I'm so very much thankful for all of the kind hearted and lionhearted people in my life and all of the new friends I have made this year.
I'm thankful for the life, stars, and beautiful universe that surrounds us. I'm thankful for the… 
I did one of those really long replies to a status on Facebook even though I tried very hard not to. #ohwell
I can't wait to see my sister and her cute little belly<BABY> <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
://///
If you want to be really embarrassed go through old conversations you had with people you had a crush on when you were younger
When someone says something stupid but you're not in the mood to argue 
Is it too vain to say that I think my legs were made for chunky heeled ankle booties? It probably is but like it's true
LOL
There is no force strong enough to stop this Paramore kick that I've been on the past few days.
So taking French has taught me how to write in French, understand French, and inspired me to dress hella French, but I still can't speak it.
ew gtfo
it's also the same white boys that complain about why they can't say the n word to their friends as a term of endearment like black people
It's funny how the same white boys that live off of black culture and "twerking" are saying that people are overreacting to this...????
Ugh I cannot. I need to chill <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
.@erinmaglietta and I just spent like 20 minutes explaining what a fuckboy was to our professors.
TL;DR - stop shitting on other girls for not possessing physical qualities you think makes you superior because of the opinions of men<WAVING HAND SIGN>
If your favorite things about you are your favorite because you think guys will like it, it's not actually YOUR fav tbh
You can be tall and cute or small and fierce with or without the approval of some punk ass fuckboy who's ego is too easily threatened
Like "I love being short cause guys love girls who are small so they don't feel overpowered" or "cause being small is cute" Fuck that mess.
I hate it when girls say they love something about themselves because "guys don't like" the opposite like wow okay stop shitting on others
There should be more of a worldly effort to make Monday suck less. We should start handing out free cupcakes and pizza on Mondays.
just cause you're a good kisser doesn't mean you're a good person yo
@blackbeanqueen omg yes plz thank you! I'll let you know when I'm dying and in dire need of them!
@blackbeanqueen I barely had a voice then I started singing along and boom got it back! It's the best remedy <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
If you're wondering how to get over a cold faster, stay in the shower for like an hour listening and singing to old school Paramore
I feel like I'm going to explode
Ah. ha. It all makes sense now. Nice to see where your true intentions lie. Have fun. You win. Congratulations. Hoorah.
I had a dream I wore my new boots everywhere so guess who is going to make that reality
Why don't people in movies ever listen to their children or dogs when weird things starts happening?
What is the squirrel to human ratio? All I want to know is if we have something to worry about because it seems like we may.
I feel like Ariel, minus the mermaidiness and the hair and the one true love thing. Basically just the not being able to speak thing.
@SymoneSalib I know! It warms my soul so much!!!
this cold went from cute and sneezy to a sudden loss of voice and heavy mouth breathing #disaintcute
feelin like poo again. Woohhoooohooooooooooooo
I had such a lovely lovely time last night! It was the perfect way to end a poo week <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
When you have a great dream then wake up and realize it isn't real 
Suddenly feel very uncomfortable and it's so not bueno <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Every time I sit or stand still my head starts hurting. Is this how footloose works?
I'm a decent person. I don't deserve this. Please gtfo of my seat.
WHY ARE YOU IN MY SEAT?? THERE ARE SO MANY OPEN SPOTS GTFOO OMMMGGGGGG YOU SUCK
@blackbeanqueen maybe!
WHY DO PEOPLE STILL THINK DOING BLACKFACE IS OKAY???????????
@blackbeanqueen I don't know, that frog looks hella punk to me. it's not even sitting on the jet ski <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I really can't deal with this right now.
we all know the sound of someone who is pissed off typing
And also how there are way too many fuck boys m'ladying around. So I guess you can say I'm feeling a bit better.
I just went on a rant about men perpetuating ideals concerning women and creating the standards of what is "normal" and "feminine"
My chest feels like it's about to explode I don't think this "chill out" thing is working.
@blackbeanqueen yeah I'm trying to chilllllllll
don't have the money to attend my own party. yay
Spent money grocery shopping when I probably should've used it for something more useful. yay *extra fucked up edition*
forgot to do a take home quiz because I thought I had the time and would remember. yay
accidentally left my dinner out and I won't be back home until dinner. yay
I can feel the anxiety attack creeping.
I need Amy Poehler's book like yesterday.
lololololololololololololololololololololololololololololllllllllloooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllll
Note to self; Don't watch a move that takes place entirely in an underground tunnel because it will make you feel claustrophobic and sick
Maybe I should just wear all black and be ironic.
I want to channel the Lauren Conrad aesthetic for this tea party not the grown ass chick dressed up like a toddler look.
I need to find me a fella like Olan Rogers forreal <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
For breakfast I have tea and mac and cheese because I'm only on the cusp of adulthood.
Some people will strive to make you bitter, don't give them that satisfaction.
@itsjennnnyall I CAN'T.


Is this cover actually good or am I just desperate to post a new one
I know how much it can sometimes hurt. You feel like the whole world has made you the ugly girl.
She rearranges all the light in the room so you're always in the shadow well that's what it feels like to you. Baby I've been there too.
*plays song to try to feel better. Only listens to first part and gets more upset.

I started listening to french music thinking I'd understand some of it because I am taking a french class. Nope. Still gonna jam tho
Moment of much needed appreciation to the fantastic beings who aren't toxic or mean spirited that are in my life right now. Y'all the best.
Today has been a load of me getting nostalgic over people I shouldn't be nostalgic over and concerning myself over how they never changed.
Seriously regret cutting my hair. I look way more stocky than I intended.
Also who do I need to kill to make that dress fit that well again? It was only a year ago, damn it.

I have no business trying to watch the newest planet of the apes when the first one scarred me as a child, yet I still want to...
All we really have in this world are our words and actions so you have to make sure they align.
You have to be really self-focused to do that and think it's okay. How does something like that sit so comfortably in you

@blackbeanqueen yes yes yes!!
@blackbeanqueen oh no! Just missed it<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
But seriously when is the planetarium open?
I'm not feeling going back home doing nothing after this
Why are ghosts in movies always women? Why not make the ghost a bitter dude who got "friendzoned" years ago and still hasn't moved on #scary

I ALSO LOVE CATS 
Yo real talk, Taylor Swift hella body goals

It really kills me to see people physically drained and pale from overwhelming sadness.

I need more coffee
F da rulez
But ima still try to look cute <DANCER>
I didn't sleep at all last night, so today will be an interesting day
I only have myself to blame for waiting for so long to do this assignment, but at the same time I am so over it.
@ashleyisnoadult yeahhhh it's so hard to find research that works with both the theory and career unless it's exclusively connected ughhh
mocha wake up from Wawa actually gives me life.
@ashleyisnoadult I don't actually think it makes any sense but I'm going for it, what about you??
@ashleyisnoadult I'm doing the assertion paper with the symbolic interactionism theory and the TV/Film career like how it's all connections
@ashleyisnoadult I believe you girl...make him eat his words
@ashleyisnoadult same. I have yet to even read the assignment sheet in detail so this will be a lengthy night.
I'll start my paper after this movie *5 movies later* just one more

The results are in....MY SCRIPT SUCKS! Thanks for playing everybody!

I'm casually laying on top of a pile of gas bills on my couch right now, if you care to know how adult life is going.
But I'm not feeling walking home in the dark tho
@floydlumpkin oh god no, what even is their identity? WHAT ABOUT THE SAME FIRST AND LAST NAME OMG
Professors who give you a list of possible essay questions and only pick the ones you didn't think would be on the test are actually awful
@blackbeanqueen ew rip him apart for me please
- How much coffee have you had today? 
- Yes.
Does anyone else suddenly become hyper aware of their name? Like holy shit yup that is it. That is what I am called. That is me.
Is my coffee watery or just cold now? Trick question, it is both.
I absolutely love how music can change my mood from crap to significantly less crap
I don't like today tbh. Today can leave now

My reward for finishing this assignment is going to be a jog around the neighborhood, which doesn't actually seem like a reward at all.
having a day off aka trying not to eat everything in sight.

Do I care anymore?
Nah
@blackbeanqueen @erinmaglietta yes yes yes, I am do down for some yummy fake hotdogs
@blackbeanqueen maybe these weird cravings are how they keep the hot dog business going
I don't like hotdogs, but I am craving hotdogs. This is a problem.
If only life was as smooth and effortless as alcohol going down
Or maybe a functioning member of society that matters
Maybe for Halloween I'll be important or something lol

I'm running on 5 tiny packets of smarties, 30 minutes of sleep, and a wild cherry pepsi. I'm probably going to die soon tbh
I finished the paper with like 15 minutes to spare holy hallelujah I'm ready to sleep forever and also eat some nachos
Listen, I have 3 pages left to write can we leave
@SymoneSalib I knowww I should've
Gratefully taking coffee donations today. I promise to bake you something for your kindness
If you see me passed out on the sidewalk it's because I'm too exhausted to walk, but wake me up cause I still have to finish this paper
Hella headache
@SymoneSalib same <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
My paper is basically written, it's just not written. I literally have 6 full pages of quotes and paraphrases I have yet to discuss.
Tonight. is. a. really. not. good. night.
@riffrafflove if I didn't have 2 papers to write tonight I'd be so in there
I just want to have a good day and not feel like crying all the time
BUT on the bright side my butt is doing some decent things today
I miss having hair
A sure way to feel not so great is to look at old pictures of yourself.
I may still be very bitter
But like COME ON
Someone get me a glass a water, the thirst is strong

well I was almost okay

For the first time all semester I don't have 100 things to do before monday, so now I have no idea what to dooooooooo
