Save serious relationships for AFTER you graduate COLLEGE. Or at least be in college. Because then you at least have figured yourself out.
YOURE SUPPOSED TO ENJOY BEING YOUNG NOT ACT LIKE YOURE MARRIED TO SOMEONE.
I also don't understand how people have long relationships in high school.
But then again I've never been in love so I wouldn't know.
I honesty don't know if I'll ever get married. Like I want to but I can't deal with the same person forever.
Like honestly who wants to be talked to 24/7. Or to be w the same person 24/7. Take a breather.

My room is like 20¬∞ so in other words perfect sleeping conditions.
Good god you are such a liar. I can't stand it.
I need to go get candy for my swim lessons kids but I don't want to go to Walmart so fuck.
I wish girls would realize that it's not cute when they play stupid or helpless around boys. It's pathetic.
I don't know what to think anymore and it's really starting to piss me off.
The rain is really starting to kill my paychecks. The pool hasn't stayed open all day in forever.
Fucking pathetic.
I dropped my bagel on my leg on my way to the pool because some asshole was tailgating me and I'm pissed and sad.
I don't know what I would do without Kennedy and Fabi. <TWO HEARTS>

Wishing that it would've stayed cloudy so no one would come swimming and I could go home.
Netflix keeps buffering and I'm ready to punch a baby.
Forcing myself to go to sleep instead of tweeting everything on my mind.
Kids these days are so disrespectful. <POUTING FACE>

My back tans super quickly and the rest of my body doesn't tan at all.
I always wonder what it feels like to know the someone is 'the one'. That has to be the best feeling ever.
I hate that songs always say girl so I feel like I can't tweet the lyrics.
Argued with a kid for a solid 10 minutes today because he wouldn't get off the diving board but I got paid to do it so it's cool.
We've been waiting for an hour to be seated and if this isn't the best damn food I've ever tasted I'm going to be so pissed.
About to eat some grass because I'm so hungry.
My biggest pet peeve is when people shove religion down others' throats.
I rarely ever use snapchat anymore.
I have done absolutely nothing today.
Ryan finally comes home today <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I tried convincing my mom that I wasn't the one who made the basement a mess but then I remembered I'm the only kid that lives at home.
@kkkkkayla_ okay
This is the perfect sleeping weather.
Worked two days in a row and didn't get burned. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I hate when I get so tired that everything becomes blurry.

I'm super tired of all the bullshit.
I say things are okay when they really aren't.
Screw the people that make you feel shitty and cry.
I wish I was leaving for college soon and not getting ready for senior year.
I hate when I stop caring. Because that's when I become a bitch.

I'll never understand why girls want a tragically romantic relationship. Wouldn't you rather be happy all the time instead?
Wait, I have a 98% in American Gov. Why am I studying for this final?
That was our last full day of junior year and holy shit time flies.
Someone call 911 because I was just brutally raped by my Spanish final.
Okay we're in high school. We DO NOT tie our shirts with pony tails behind our backs.
@BrooklynMariah Brooklyn go die
All I want is my ACT score.
I'm writing on graph paper because I'm out of regular paper and that how you know school needs to end.
@JuicyJacer <PENSIVE FACE> okay
I feel like I want to wear extremely short shorts tomorrow just so Gomez will send me home.
I'll never understand why people say they don't like water. It's water. It has no flavor. How do you not like it?
Kennedy's dog just got mad at the carpet and started attacking it. She's an idiot just like her owner.

Like 90% of the school hates you. You're just too fucking arrogant to see it.
Is it weird that sometimes I hold onto my hair when I sleep so my hand doesn't hang over my bed?
It's that time of year when it's too hot to use my comforter but too cold without it.
Teachers always tell us to not check out at this time of the year but they've already checked out so who are they trying to fool?
I don't know if I have homework because the last time I was at school for more than an hour was Monday.
Trust is a fucked up thing. Like you just put yourself out there and hope that nothing bad happens. And that's scary as hell.
Can we have finals tomorrow and be done please?
Oh, and if you took some of my clothes it'd be greatly appreciated if you'd give those back.
Also, my shaving cream is gone. Wtf happened at this party?
To anyone that came to the party my brother threw: what happened to my bathroom trash can?
@fhuerious I want ice cream and shell. Check if chrisley is on tonight
@fhuerious shut your whore mouth

I'm 99% sure that our school has the heater on today.

So many things to say, but I don't know how to say them.
Sometimes it's hard to walk around knowing that what we used to be was just a waist of time.

The best part about the ACT is that YOU CAN TAKE IT AGAIN IF YOU DO BADLY. So take a deep breath and stop stressing. Everything will be okay
I'd rather feel nothing than feel bad.
People always say be yourself but what they really mean is be the part of you that will fit in.
@BailsamaBinladn how would you know? It's not like you've ever taken one betch.
The best part of an ice bath is taking a 40 minute shower afterwards.

I don't understand how girls sleep with their hair up.
Why is it so hard for people to be straight with you anymore?
The fact that we have to wear jeans in 90 degree weather bc of Gomez pisses me off. Just let us wear shorts.
