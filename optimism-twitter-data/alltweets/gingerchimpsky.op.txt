@lokiscottishrap @Scotsfox @dhothersall What does it take for you lot to finally  regroup and try to find out what went wrong? Seriously?

Surely the lesson from Scotland is they we…
There is justice
It's like having a good song at the Eurovision song contest
Come on East Renfrweshire I want to go to sleep



@sosolidshoe @LesleyRiddoch @patrickharvie the political balance is that great, the economic balance is that great, all in the SE.
I'm going to prove the legitimacy of that poll. I'm going to ask every single person again "what did you answer?"
This is an earthquake not a protest v…
We should be encouraged to work on our strengths and no be chastised for our weaknesses

I'm glad there are so many impressive press people to cover the election for us.
@iainmacwhirter it all looks very impressive
It was probably poorly timed and badly conveyed, but I stick by what I have said.
@DaftLimmy East Renfrewshire
@YESthatcherDead nah stop. "unionists are enemy liars". My Dad is a unionist but he's not an "enemy liar", show some empathy. #SNP
i'm quite enjoying playing the game without even knowing the rules
Um, I just want to know 3 things.
1. Why marking with a pencil?
2. Why postal ballots?
3. Why can't I dbl check my vote online after count?
@Shiny02 listening to the smiths, its the only thing that seems appropriate given the circumstances
@NursieDear25 that's what you get for being nice to people who don't understand nice
@IndyForTheGuy papers tomorrow dude, it was Scotland's fault!
@Rossiboy5 @kittycatboyd @chunkymark you mad hippys, I love you to bits
@NursieDear25 jeez mine is almost empty
@Shiny02 the smiths half a person. Do you have a vacancy for a back scrubber?
@kittycatboyd then keep redefining it, next year I'm voting SSP
@Shiny02 still listening to the smiths, started with panic
@maherliam16 @thisisamy_ disabled and sick dying, rich getting richer, most vulnerable demonized, go fuck yourself toryboy
@NicolaSturgeon @theSNP thanks for being our rock Nicola x
@thisisamy_ sweet dreams and feck all this nonsense, change is coming its just how and when
@GrayInGlasgow I am so going to listen to that song immediately
@alextomo I find that very hard to believe
@maherliam16 @thisisamy_ I've seen it on the ground, worked the soup kitchens, you're the weak one dude, I pity you
Headlines tomorrow - it was Scotland's fault
@twcuddleston @chunkymark wait and see the results, the postal vote is wide open to fraud, other countries mock us for it
@DerekBateman2 @lionelbarber I literally don't believe it
@GrayInGlasgow let's go. Its time
@WingsScotland fuck this, when's the next referendum
Exit poll says 316 con seats, I don't even believe it
@RealDeniseWelch @Kevin_Healey this guy, lol, you must be a lot younger than me if you can't remember Mr T :) 
@Kevin_Healey @RealDeniseWelch wait and I'll find a photo
@RealDeniseWelch @Kevin_Healey in my strange mind, Mr T comes along and slaps her upside the head, calls her a fool, then gives her guidance
#TweetYourSnacks 
@OwenJones84 good luck Owen, you're a good guy
| @NicolaSturgeon #IvotedSNP to invest in public services not nuclear bombs #BairnsNotBombs #GE15 
@botherer @RevStu all your bases are belong to us @RuthDavidsonMSP, my hair is a bird, your argument is invalid
Vote #Labour, who cares about policies? They can keep the #ToriesOutNow and they are the joint favourites
@davidschneider I thought it was funny, hit the nail on the head
@chunkymark Paxman gives fake grilling and scrunches his eyebrows together? Dunno I don't watch TV but that's probably about right
@Kevin_Healey I enjoy following you, you make a big difference and promote awareness, my best regards :)
No matter what the results are tomorrow, no one can criticise the efforts of @NicolaSturgeon, she has been utterly fantastic, a true leader
@PeterMurrell @theSNP good luck in the face of adversity Peter and give Nicola a big hug from all of us, what an ambassador, very very proud
@GerryHassan @hugorifkind I never lost an English friend because I pointed our how ridiculous the UK system of governance is, most agree
@thisisamy_ Rik Mayall didn't get a telling off for Alan
@David_Cameron I voted #SNP cause I herd u liek ukipz
@DaftLimmy I almost want her to keep her seat so Nicola has someone to rip the pish out of on FMQ's
@chunkymark @OccupyDemocracy can't make it, please do a few segments would be great to hear what ppl have to say
@loubgray @mhairi1921 I hope so, heard Mhairi speak last year and we talked about her for days, inspirational, do us proud Paisley!
@chunkymark @NxtGenUK excellent
@GrayInGlasgow cool. *All Norwegian Christians are deluded morons who will believe anything*. Ahh, been wanting to say that for years
@RealDeniseWelch @Kevin_Healey @KTHopkins I would just roll my eyes and laugh, but she advocated murdering migrants, very disturbed person
@Douglas4Paisley @D_Blanchflower what a negative message - "only Labour can stop the Tories", is that all you have to offer people?
@Ed_Miliband wow, so you're going to end austerity, that's fantastic Ed
@Ed_Miliband so you're going to end Tory austerity?
@ACLU @ggreenwald @AlexanderAbdo oh so its illegal, who goes to jail then? What measures will be taken to prevent it from happening again?
@NursieDear25 yeah, but happy and optimistic nonetheless, finished work soon then off to vote!

@DavidPBMaddox @JimForScotland are you serious? Do you ever get out and talk to real people or are you happy in that bubble of yours?
Just look. Its going to be one of these twats running the country. Wouldn't trust them to run a papershop.

@charltonbrooker auf weidersehn Monty, rollercoaster, quazatron :)
@charltonbrooker it was weak and predictable. Newswipe was good back in the day, this was just shit
@WingsScotland They just won't believe she's not an outrageous liar like Cameron, Clegg and Miliband, they can't get their heads around it
#SNP #VoteSNP 
It is recognising that Labour are no longer Labour 
#VoteSNP 
@David_Cameron its a short term plan to dismantle the welfare state, but yes its working
@LabourEoin I agree, have never seen such huge support for Tories across the media despite the outright damage they have caused, it stinks
Ret=Yes
Fav=No
@ChriswMP @SocialistAgenda I think not. #SNP is anti-austerity, Labour wants to continue to punish the poor for the benefit of the rich
How our warped media have covered the election #GE2015  
@faisalislam for all the atrocities this government has commuted against its people,  you sure give them an easy ride
@chunkymark it'll work out well for bankers and large corps, that's guaranteed
@David_Cameron you lie effortlessly. Did you learn that at Eton?
@RossMcCaff @WingsScotland Gordon Brown put the country in a mood to begin with, wish he would just fuck off
@faisalislam @AlexSalmond no one does hypocrisy like the Tories
Please retweet. 

 
Retweet = Yes
Fav = No
@JamesMelville The owner, Alexander Lebedev, is worth over a billion, excuse me if I ignore his advice.
@LabourEoin Voltaire would have walked past a VERY small group of people shouting and thought "I wonder what that's all about?" #bbcbias
@WingsScotland @stephenpaton134 
Must be great to be a comedian, you can say what you like then call it satire if it goes wrong.
@SocialistAgenda @theSNP it's not Eddie Izzard, it's the company he keeps. If he came on his own people would have listened
Exactly. 
@LabourEoin The thing about freedom of speech or democracy is that they apply to everyone, even hecklers
@PeatWorrier isolated, labeled and demonized for daring to think differently. Welcome to the machine
What really happened in Glasgow today, sick of media manufacturing stories #lazyjournalism 
@rustyrockets Why go down that path? #Labour I liked you better when you pointed out they were all greedy bastards, I could relate to that
@scottreid1980 @Shiny02 Murphy knows he's not much more than flame bait now in Scotland, so he uses that to make opposition look bad

*Awkward* 
@LabourEoin got a lot of respect for you @LabourEoin please don't jump Murphy's bandwagon, he's truly bad for #Labour in Scotland
@chunkymark @rustyrockets #SNP
@DanSandersonHT @JohnFinnieMSP more unintelligent comment from a very silly man
@zelo_street @chunkymark how did they get her info from only a first name? IP address? How?
#SNPbecause they don't like it

I'm the luckiest guy on the world, I have 3 big sisters and they are totally brilliant x

Love over hate, empathy over hate, #HopeOverFear @citizentommy x
@AngelaHaggerty @WingsScotland you seem like a very nice person Angela, how are you today? :-)
@ZubairKhanPK @NadeemfParacha journalism is alive and well, its just not at the BBC

#GE15 #GE2015 #VoteSNP 
Think I need to expand my twitter sphere, of all those I follow I can't find anyone who gives a fuck about royals and babies #RoyalBaby
@Ed_Miliband you make them sound like a normal family in a semi detached Ed, I'm sure sleep won't be a problem
@Independent @chunkymark David Cameron accidentally tells the truth, that's him finished in the Tory party then
@iainmartin1 @StandpointMag We are all sick of the lies.The people made the #SNP and they know it. You make it all sound like a conspiracy.
@ChristainWright hiding from @NicolaSturgeon I expect, she always rips him a new one and he's due another
@HardingNicola @Kevin_Healey reports like this just make me want to get blocked too, it's becoming a badge of honour <SMIRKING FACE>
@Scotsfox classic tune
@theSNP @YesAlliance59 @NicolaSturgeon I'm not going to retweet this cause I don't agree with it, it's the weakest of all #SNP policies
@annemcelvoy @JananGanesh Turns out you were uncannily accurate with that one ;)
@WingsScotland or if @NicolaSturgeon visited @rustyrockets and they both kept completely quiet about what was discussed ... forever.
@WingsScotland what's next? The CPS defending paedophiles? Oh wait .....
@rattusdawgus @WingsScotland oh no, he's been at the Solvite


@TheCommonSpace @LabourOutOfScot just look at it, people in wigs and robes and gold leaf on everything, what is the point of that in 2015?
@LordAshcroft @Aye4Scotland bullshit, everyone else gets grilled and has to debate, Cameron gets the comfy cushion
@WingsScotland shows that it depends on who writes history, nice to know yougov has money to waste on pointless polls
Dropping tax for min wage earners under 30 hours is another tax break for corps #CameronMustGo
If you believe the Scottish Sun supports the #SNP then I'm afraid you are gullible. Murdoch / Tories know it's a toxic association....
@LadyAmandaBrett @NicolaSturgeon @TheSunNewspaper It's perhaps because you don't like it one bit that they are doing it?
Perfect. 
@WingsScotland And the Tories followed their same script. Can smell a #Grandcoalition, better get down the bookies while the odds are 33/1
@JimForScotland @WingsScotland After #bbcqt, all Tories tweeting the same thing, all Labour tweeting the same thing. #bettertogether
"They tried to bury us. They didn't realise we were seeds" 
has never been more apt than in Scotland…
@DavidPBMaddox The sad state of democracy in the UK. Labour are wielding the Tories like a shitty stick against SNP voters. It won't work.
@JamesMelville For a wee person she's head and shoulders above the oppostion, brighter, sharper and a hell of a lot more believable
@chunkymark English sun Tory, Scottish sun SNP, to reinforce myth that voting SNP will help Tories, mind games from Murdoch
@David_Cameron isn't it better to raise minimum wage so they can afford to pay tax?
@Harryslaststand or its a stunt to make you think that?
@Kevin_Healey @UKChange Signed. Good luck Kevin
Sowing the seeds of love :) 
@LabourEoin I think (hope) Murdoch represents a dying media platform and this is a well timed move by Ed Miliband. Interesting times...
@KevinJPringle @WingsScotland @IpsosMORIScot @theSNP Um, isn't there something wrong with the arithmetic? 101%? Twice?
@MisssyM @IndyForTheGuy They seem to think if a lie is shouted loud enough and for long enough it becomes fact, this is why they fail
@chunkymark In times of hardship, fascism points the finger at the foreigner and gains a foothold with angry but naive people.
@GMacdonaldMSP Bookies don't seem to think so but who knows? Neither seem to like the idea of Scotland having much say in things
@clairerobsc1 @Harryslaststand @blairmcdougall No, calling the SNP contemptous isn't the same as a direct and personal insult
@Kevin_Healey @realperidot54 It is very offensive, but take heart in the fact that most people think she's a massive idiot
@TheSunNewspaper are you guys just constantly perched outside RB's flat spying on who goes in and out? You love him.
@FranklandMark @citizentommy Don't say that name! Seen the film Beetlejuice? Same thing but much worse, call her Hatie Cockpins or something
@DerekScott1984 @YesAlliance59 In fairness it was banks who humped the UK, #Labour bailed them to save London
@mrmarksteel the mind boggles
I love how the main stream media keep trying to alter reality with their stories

@chunkymark and less tax gained from workers. Tax credit? Raise the minimum wage you arseholes and people will be able to afford income tax!
@David_Cameron then why are you ruining those things?

@StuartJRitchie @DaftLimmy uncanny
@bbcnickrobinson @OwenJones84 You're a journalist and a Tory, go and find out
@chunkymark and a complete coward who refuses honest debate, he will only talk to media sycophants #CameronMustGo
@David_Cameron The bankers got us into this mess, are you going to ask them to leave?
@DerekBateman2 It astounds me that some people still vote for them, have they been in a coma?
@David_Cameron Yeah, take the focus away from the UK Dave, it's your only chance!
@Sneekyboy @WingsScotland It's Labour's new approach to austerity, soon we'll have to pay for their bus fares as well.
@marthasydenham They both sound equally incompetent and @AndrewMarr9 extracts nothing of value from either
Kudos to @ExaroNews for working hard to expose the scandal and cover up of paedophiles in Westminster 
@IanIwrussell thanks for uploading this, missed the first half hour!
@abeckpdesign @citizentommy it really stood out! in the same spirit as the music by the late Martyn Bennett - celtic fusion

@DaftLimmy Troll 2

@lee_jaydensmum @IanIwrussell @charliegas @snp yeah, link to source please?
Lol, not really dude 
@rustyrockets heard this on the radio today, they act like its his duty to talk about most painful stuff to everybody, shite
@DaftLimmy nothing would happen until he got short circuited by the bleach
@GeneralElec2015 @laurenxriley you just helped make it a thing by mentioning it
@ScotDecides lots of irony to wade through there
@theSNP not good enough!
@ScotDecides and so you show a photo of Nicola sturgeon looking perplexed to enhance the message
@DaftLimmy yourself, smiling and being happy
Lab/SNP working together = chaos.
Tories hauling us out of EU into isolation, prompting Scotland to le…
@zinhlehazelbird @chunkymark @nayyirahwaheed may their souls find peace
@WingsScotland please stop
@GoodwinMJ @chunkymark bunker politics is all they have, no supportable policies of their own
@ScotDecides David Cameron George Osbourne ian Duncan smith actual demons from hell

But new readers probably do not yet know the sheer extent of it: 
SNP Labour pact the better Labour are doing in England?
@UK_Database_CSA @chunkymark MP's voted on whether OSA should protect paedophiles 
Why would anyone vote NO to this? 
Why would anyone vote NO to expose paedophiles?! See where your MP stands on this 
@unionstogether Like they got rid of zero hour contracts?
@Lynne_Currie @theSNP @JohnSwinney Increase the mimimum wage to £8.70 by 2020? So what until then? Only companies profit
Surely increasing the minimum wage will help austerity? Then working people can afford to pay their tax? I just don't get it
Jeremy Clarkson is like a big ugly zit that just got squeezed, he'll just pop up again somewhere else
@WingsScotland I use Network Attached Storage then back really important stuff up to a removable drive from there, you just press a button
much thought has been put into things.
The problem with things people have put a lot of thought into, is that it's only people who put a lot of thought into things who realise how
@alanbissett It's still a classic :)
@BBCScotlandNews How distorted this country is, 350 plants are "worth" £150k. Almost as much as the BBC would spend on flowers for a studio.
Thought I would watch this dazzling act of hypocrisy again, it's nothing less than surreal -
@chunkymark Now the voice of England must be heard. Please don't get your hopes up England because being heard means fuck all, believe us.
