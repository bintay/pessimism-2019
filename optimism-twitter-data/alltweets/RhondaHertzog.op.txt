@its_me_kos girl keep one in your car!
Good things are happening here...very good!!
Let the negotiations begin!!!
I feel good about house showing #4...real good... Trying to stay hopeful and optimistic.  Both stretches for me <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
This whole "keeping your house show ready" is making me CRAZY!!
7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, spark and iced coffee this morning and still yawning....seriously??
Dinner was a pork chop, red wine, a bowl of chocolate frozen yogurt and a cookie.  Veggies say whaaat?
House is ready to show tomorrow and I don't know what to do with myself!  The roomba is doing the final floor clean now <THUMBS UP SIGN>üèº
This is how we kill time on a Saturday avoiding housework 
I have a very unhealthy attachment to ice cream right now...guess my body needs calcium or something
If Pinterest is so smart and can pick things for me, why does it keep picking crap I've already pinned?
Good times.., 
BBQ cookoff, margaritas, beer....good stuff.
@its_me_kos you earned it!!
My view today 
Ad in the paper lists the basics of the house, people are calling asking us the basics of the house.  Seriously?  Ugh..,
@its_me_kos I'd love to know what you think of it.  Myself and others haven't been blown away so far.
@Stephaniek623 did you ever read the Crossfire series?  It's like 50 shades.  I have all 4 hard copies if you want to borrow them.


Let's sell our house!
Just found a watermelon jolly rancher in my purse, no idea where it came from, but I haven't had one in years...takes me back to being young
<THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN> to red velvet Oreos!!
Cute decanters so I can feel like I'm having wine at Cheeves...<INFORMATION DESK PERSON> 
What a festive touch this morning! 
This isn't root beer, folks.  This is how we roll when we are off work on a Friday! 
@Stephaniek623 get some better shoes!  If you have to wear black, Sketchers makes good comfy ones
@Stephaniek623 wear good shoes!  You're young, I assure you this is not going to kill you....
Hydrating like a boss.... 
10 miles in the cold, now a Rita.  I love this Saturday tradition!
I'm continually amazed at how easy people think it is to get your house ready to sell!  It's not.... Need Mother Nature on our side
@Stephaniek623 I used to (and still do) love him!  I saw him in concert twice when he was touring way back when.
Cheers! 
@Stephaniek623 hope you've done your homework and know how to get your nutrients elsewhere.  If no intestinal issue, no need for bandwagons
Yay to German beer! 
No bubbly in the house...so I improvise.  Riesling and OJ it is!
Snickerdoodle blondies have this house smelling nice!
Carving a beer and burger at 10 am...had to take care of it! 
@its_me_kos he deferred his registration this year so he has an automatic entry for next year.  He either does it or donates his money.
So apparently I just signed up for marathon #3...good thing I have until 12.13.15 to prepare!
@its_me_kos yay!  I hate to get rid of her, just can't with her &amp; packing/moving.  I just bought that huge bag of kitten chow I'll give you!
This kitten needs a home!  With us moving soon, I don't need an extra cat to deal with, she's so sweeeeeeet! 
Fifth half marathon...check.  Humidity was a biotch, but I made it! 
If seeing these pictures does not affect you, then you and I are very different.  This is why I do races... 
@its_me_kos thanks!  I'm looking forward to having fun!
I always hated the car buying process, until we started the house buying process.  I'm gonna punch someone soon!
Jeans season is a sad reminder of how poorly I've been eating lately.
Can't we just agree on a price and stop this back and forth nonsense?
@its_me_kos on a Saturday?  During the holiday season?  Hell to the no...
@its_me_kos bill and I came in about the same time, I was just a few seconds behind him
EBC turkey trot preparation 
@WSkrabanek hope you're feeling better!
I'm obsessed with house hunting...legitimately obsessed
Yummmm.... 
@its_me_kos yes ma'am I am!  Alarm was set for 5 am but by body decided 4:45 sounded better....
Listening to @ericpaslay playing great tunes in the Temple High auditorium tonight!
@its_me_kos go through Lott and Robinson.  Beautiful drive and no interstate.  Takes same amount of time.
Cold and drizzle didn't stop me from eating up this beautiful trail! 
@Stephaniek623 its in the genes!
More shananigans today... 
This is what those who have no kids and are on vacation do during the day... 
@its_me_kos good for you!
Breakfast of champions! 
Still thirsty, even after all the martinis last night! 
12 miles done, now cleaning and laundry, then tonight it's Martini's!  Can't wait!
Sure husband, I'll have drinks with you and your phone... 
@Stephaniek623 look at you!! <INFORMATION DESK PERSON> love it!!
@its_me_kos funny stuff...you know how I feel about those hills! <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
So much wine....<WINE GLASS>
@its_me_kos @WSkrabanek join you where?
Da-da-da-day drinkin' <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 
@Stephaniek623 that's my favorite number, too <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
making grilled cheese sandwich with dark rye bread...seemed like a good idea and it was tasty, but I had no idea if it was the right "color"
Take a bite of banana, then a bite of Hershey's chocolate.  Repeat until the chocolate is gone.  Tasty....!
@its_me_kos it sucks!  Except the kid part, I can't speak of that
You know it's going to be a good day when you're drinking vodka drinks at 10 til noon <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@its_me_kos when we remodeled our closet, I threw out about 25 pairs of shoes.  Sadly, I think my collection has built itself back up...
As much as I love wine, I do hold a special in place in my heart for a good beer 
Yes, yes it does... 
@RhondaHertzog: @RhondaHertzog: What in the world took me so long to get a Roomba?!  I think it's gonna be my new BFF!
@WSkrabanek who knows?!  It flickered a few times then just went out.  Bill is dove hunting with Steve so I'm making do!
Having to use the gas grill outside like a big girl while we have no power <FLUSHED FACE>
@its_me_kos well we had a long drying out period during the game, so this is technically round 2 :)
10:40 at night, on a Thursday, and I'm drinking in a bar.  Tomorrow's gonna be fun!
Sippin on a beer, while the song "day drinkin" is playing.  Yes, I agree with you, Little Big Town...don't mind if I do
Baylor S&amp;W isnt messing around with these appt reminders.
@its_me_kos little saddle soreness, ey?  It's the worst!
@its_me_kos I had a headlight on.  Guess there was something in the road I didn't see.  New gravel aided in the gashing..
Dressing to run this morning, I told Bill my shorts made my belly look big, to which he replied that it was big...<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> that little nut!
Road rash hurts...booooo <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> 
This view does not get old 
2.5 hours of heavy sweating doing garden work = a refreshing beverage at 11 am... Sometimes water just won't do!
@its_me_kos I'm letting mine go, that ish makes me itch!
@its_me_kos sounds like my kind of trip!
Shopping makes me thirsty... 
@its_me_kos hot doesn't even begin to describe that! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
My little sister and I in the mid 80's.  Wow....#karatbt 
My favorite way to start a Saturday! 
@its_me_kos lil bit <PRINCESS>
Some carbs with my carbs for lunch.  Had a big kolache for breakfast, too!  13 miles on Subday...<FLUSHED FACE> 
@Stephaniek623 you'll be ok in a few days <FLUSHED FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Stephaniek623 squats are evil...but so good for you!  Keep your weight in your heels <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@RadioLunchbox saw this today and thought of you... 
When you have a mtg with someone really important and they say "oh, I didn't think you worked here anymore..."...ummm awkward...!
I go through this phase every few months but it's BAD this time...new house fever<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@its_me_kos yea...you know how I love hills!
Yes I see you, no you're not hiding very well... Goofy <SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
@its_me_kos wear the ones with the hole on the side <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
You know it's going to be a good day when these are on your table at lunch' 
Magnolia Cafe in Austin, liking the mimosa so far.  Tastes great after running! 
@its_me_kos how many years have I added???  Hmmm....
@its_me_kos my afternoon snack is a half of a bottle of Brut!  <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Just opened a bottle of bubbly!  Celebrating our nation's freedom and that I just paid off some bills!
@its_me_kos yep!  We are lost...what to do...what to do
All I can think about is how my floors need mopping...and all I can think about is how much I don't want to mop...rough life
@its_me_kos hell yea!
Mexican martini from Coronas in Belton...it's quite tasty 
Refreshing malt beverage on a hot June day <BEER MUG> 
Something weird is going on in my garden...

I've had an iPhone since the very first one, always upgraded, etc...and now I casually drop it and it cracks...ugh!!!!!
