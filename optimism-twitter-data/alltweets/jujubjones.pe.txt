Phew that venting helped a lot
It really bothers me when people only look out for their selves
I know what you're doing because I use to do it
My last rt is so damn funny because its the truth
Or a 40
Red red wine
Really weird I'm craving some wine
Whenever I'm about to look for something I'll forget what I'm searching for

The first step to being happy is finding what makes you happy within yourself.
When people say nothing is for free don't day nothing I'll give you something for free just to show you that's not true.
Envy showers
Love that you can make my day become so much better just by talking to you
Ever since that rapist did those things in Rancho I havent skated at night in days
Easy to read off body language
When someone asks what's wrong and the other replies saying nothing, there is something wrong so don't say there isnt!
@FreddyFreshFire haha for sure keep your schedule open gonna have bottles for days just no fireball! It's gonna be #hurrygrabher instead <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FreddyFreshFire hell yeah it will let's turn the fuck up! Haha

Hopefully I don't end up arrested
So exciting I turn 21 in 8 days been waiting for that day my whole childhood life!
Times going by so slow 3 needs to hurry
They already look like they don't give a fuck
Do you ever look at little kids and can already tell they will be in trouble when they get older?
I eat pizza everyday
kyoto, japan 
Tahoe og will have you feeling like you're really out the states
So greatful my mom use to come up to my room and ? me everytime I smelled like pure dankness, now that she knows I smoke, she ignores it<VICTORY HAND>
Shady ass people
Love listening to songs that remind me of you
I get new ones next week <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I go through converse so fast
Really wish you didn't have to live so far away
You walk around like the world owes you something. You ain't shit.
Everyone's annoying me today
I guess I'll move now
30 minutes til work, too lazy to get up
Story of my life 
I can't help but countdown the days to my birthday
You are just a friend stop thinking anymore of it
Everyone has that one friend who's such a bad influence
Carried a bottle out today and my mom was like better put that in a bag to hide that. Love her
I can only focus on one thing
So fucked up right now
We got away from the security guy
Drunk off the bottle me and Clark chugged
Me and clark got away
Has my parents fooled
Clark is guts
Our minds are more powerful than we think they are
I feel like they will find this guy rancho is a city everyone watches out for each other in some way.
Irks my soul when someone can't keep a conversation going
So don't hate on someone who doesn't have those things and having fun with their life you could of done the same but you chose another route
You can be an adult without those things
I don't understand why people feel like they have to show theyve grown up by buying a house or a car they can barely afford.
Audio on the bay juju is coming for ya
I may not be a cop but I have the blood of a detective in my veins
You're alive to make yourself and someone else feel the meaning of life.
It's blow up jujus phone kinda day
Everyone and they mom's hitting me up
Today feels like a good day
Kick me in my weak arm and I'll punch you, no fucks given.
There's days I can't stand her she irks my buttons
Mariahs a fucking bitch
Middle finger up *
This is a miracle I stayed home the whole day.. record.
I see the future in your eyes <TWO HEARTS>
There's always someone watching
Tbh that was my first time in 2 years I'll say <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Momma offered me 10 bucks to do the dishes jump on it real quick
Girl you have my attention so what's the destination

Because 7 8 ass
Should I stay or should I go
Was looking for something and out of the blue I get a text saying they have it
It's interesting how energy works
So weird how one person can warm your heart just by hearing the sound of their voice ♡
My skateboard is cursed
Fell on my leg and it hurts to walk lmao
Shot fucking sucks
Why do I always fall and hurt myself?
You're ancient history tonight will be a mystery
I get distracted so quick it's like quicksand
Have an obsession of rolling blunts
@lilaaaay__ let me get that
I have mixed emotions for edc
So apparently I fell on the floor <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
Hate missing school on days I just don't feel like going and then when I actually don't feel good I can't miss.
Thank god I just do funny shit though and not something I'd regret
I'm starting to get back to my blackout drunk days
Waking up and still feel drunk
2 bottles in a day damn I'm fucked up
I feel accomplished bought a bottle and I'm not 21
So fucking drunk
I low key felt cool
That was easy
Damn all I did was smile and convince the gas station guy that I'm 21 and I got in this special room <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Terry just chugged the whole tequila <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Terry was like you turn up good while you're 20 I can't imagine how you'll turn up at 21
I get the weirdest cravings
Making smores was the best thing I learned how to do in girl scouts.
@marmau5 don't be cheer up! <TWO HEARTS>
I thought it would be the funniest thing before I threw it and I was soo right.
Got so high I chucked my favorite water bottle on accident and broke it... :/ It was the funniest thing ever.. but fuccckkk.
Too many people hitting me up to smoke
I hate studying so much but I know if I study my ass off I can get a good grade.
Love when people help me when they know I need help
Really excited for the edc lineup to be released
@dekkastaxxx no! Stop running away from your problems! <SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
3 weeks sf here I come
Can't wait to finally see you
May the 4th be with you
I can eat it every single day
LOVE pizza
Another good ass night
It's such a good feeling when you lose your friends at a rave and find them randomly out of nowhere
Do you ever spill something in someone's car and secretly clean it up and not say a word?
@domi427__ too fucking guts
Resurgence tonight is about to be dope!
Talking to you on the phone for 5 hours was the shit<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><OK HAND SIGN>
@jenrodriguez_ damn haha I'm shocked definitely set a record for yourself aha
@jenrodriguez_ record!! Haha
Hate when you get too drunk then just pass out randomly out of nowhere
I cried from laughing so hard at the text I just got
My Grammar is fucked
I don't even have to try for it to be like damn you had enough to start feeling it
Everything I think hey I'm going to stop because I'm doing this a lot and then taking a break, then going back, my tolerance amazes me
Do you ever get too drunk where plugging your charger in the wall is the funniest thing because it's so hard?
How the fuck did I get drunk? Lol
Now that my Id doesn't scan bc it's scratched I get looks like my Id is fake<SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
Got to get use to this
Middle of sleeping and I get called in..
Rather have quality over quantity
So faded I'm agreeing just to agree
Do you ever wonder what you seem like in someone else's eyes, when someone meets u for the first time what r they thinking when they see u?
I get along with you so well its crazy but I love it
Wow
Being sore hurts but at the same time feels so good
Going back up north in a few weeks hell yeah
Those texts were all it takes is the first sentence and you're smiling uncontrollably<SMIRKING FACE>
Really considering going to audio on the bay for my 21st
That shower was everything
Just want to tell people to shut up then walk away
How do people have the energy to argue so early in the morning
can a butthole get ashy?
My feet really hurt
I just want my bed
Fuuu I'm tired
Met Jeremy rogers !!
Hate having long hair in hot weather
Rancho Cucamonga needs to stay out of the news
When your just alike someone in alot of way the attraction just grows and grows
I just had a wish come true
Call me sqweed I sprayed that dankness
I miss my best friend @dekkastaxxx
Love Ice cold water
@domi427__ happy Birthday to the best cousin and wild child I hope you have the best birthday!
I look so happy in this picture 
Last night was one of those nights I ran into everyone that I knew and haven't seen in forever
Still not home
Well today was a long fun day
Expect the unexpected is so true it's scary
Butterflies in my tummy
I give out free weed like no other
A lot of people underestimate me
First time gloving with my arm all better
Ahhh I get to melt faces tonight
I always lose shit especially the expensive stuff
Spread love and pass on good vibes
Can't wait to meet new people tonight ♡
Rave day<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Finally I see buildings and gas stations rather than being in butt fuck no where
It's honestly makes me so happy
I'm more excited to wear my duck beanie tomorrow more than anything
Cheer up butter cup
Pretty stoked to reunite with the squad tomorrow
It's a bittersweet feeling when you travel to one place, stay the night then leave back home
Aint complaining though
Why is everyone buying me rave tickets lately?
Loving the bay area
I'm forgetting like if it was alzheimers
Not a breakfast person
I'm losing it in this car
They should design a car where you can stand up and drive
If you see a car bouncing it's me dancing
Sitting in the car is making me ancy
Not down for this 6 hour drive later
@GraysonGrier buy me a piece lol
I disappear on a lot of people I don't mean to do it, it just happens
I love how my parents are just as adventurous as I am
I feel way better today
Free Wetzel pretzel and jamba juice tomorrow yeee
My immune system sucks
I turned down the beach that's when you know I'm serious
This nauseous feeling is not the biz
I feel so weird
Been feeling like this since 2 am :/
Gosh I feel like puking my brains out
I wonder what's worse having the person alive, but not remember who you are, or having them dead and remember who you were?...
You're a memory fading away
I survived
"They called the fire department because my smoke is too dank" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Toke up, light it up
Happy 420
@LongLoveDeezy good shit! I had my doubts at first but now that's over, hell yeah. Shits making me so broke everything is so expensive
@LongLoveDeezy okay good haha how nice of you!
@LongLoveDeezy still going?
There's the people that talk about doing something and then there's the people that talk and actually do it
Everyone's having Chipotle today
This heat is making my hangover suck so much more
To an extent you can be mean, but don't be a bitch
Thrift shopping today
This car ride is making me feel sick
Im a very huggable person
Take me back to last night
Don't own an animal if you're going to neglect it
How did I get in my bed, seriously
That tequila though got the best of me, I feel amazing!
I'm drunk but I feel like I've been more drunk
Like a stripper, somebody come get her shes feeling the liquor
Somebody come get her she's dancing like a stripper, somebody come get her she's dancing like a stripper. Somebody come tip her she dancing
This tequila is sneaky
Just looking at this tequila bottle ugh today's going to be wild
Me and Terry's mission is always to go to la
Said I wasn't gonna drink for a while, f that it's the weekend
@jenrodriguez_ what? Haha
@domi427__ ugh those too, my fear aha
Haven't had it in 4 years
Every time someone talks about sushi makes me cringe
Don't tell me I'm weird, I already know, suck it.
Let me show you the world
Mom came through with the taco bell
Double the clothes when you have a sister
sweeeettt
I'm tired of standing
Mariah dragged me along to boredom
Be free
@vineeters take your board it's easier
Show me what love is
How are people so okay with getting arrested? That's the last thing I want.
Next week is going to be full of adventures

I should not own a lighter, I always lose it or get bicced
The location switched from San Bernardino to la, don't mind if I do <SMIRKING FACE>
Can't wait to dance the night away next weekend with the real squad
You choose what you make out of YOUR life
Life's not meant to be easy and if you're thinking it is, it's just going to be harder when a challenge comes your way
I feel so bad when someone starts saying they want to die or kill themselves
"We all want to leave socal when everyone wants to come here, we have beaches, snow, desert, everything, while we want to move to nothing".
If I feel like I don't deserve something, sure enough I'll walk away.
I wanna go on a rv road trip
A month and day away I'll be 21 how scary is that :o
I wanna runaway and not come back
This headache I woke up with is making me an angry person
Six flags today
I love having spontaneous friends
Especially during spring
Hate school
One thing I have is self respect and I'm not going to let anyone talk me down something I want
Your decisions are based off of people's opinions
You don't know the full story, you know parts of it, there's a difference.
Thinking deep with have you on some other shit
It's funny watching drunk people do things like walking or talking
"I'm gonna have a baby mama for every race" hahaha fuck.. shit.. crap I'm <SKULL>
When the fuck am I going to start physical therapy
Don't judge me for the things I'm doing with my life, but instead ask yourself if you'd be doing the same if you hand the time on your hands
Venice monday is about to be fun
You need jesus
Full of negativeness
I love when I meet people they actually hit me back up to chill again <OK HAND SIGN>
@marmau5 your tweets crack me up lmao I love you!
I keep holding my arm like it's still in the cast <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
We on like donkey kong
Too excited for them to experience it
Taking friends to their first rave is cute to watch how excited they get
@jenrodriguez_ good its better to give it your all lol
So far it's been working
Made it a goal to go to LA once a week
@jenrodriguez_ and this is why I love you haha spot on!
I just want to discover why I was brought to earth
Pulling a grandma move and going to sleep
Drinking has been making me such a sad person I don't like it
I'm never gonna get over this flu with what I've been doing <WEARY FACE>
After today no more alci for me I've been turning into an alcoholic
No school tomorrow = get drunk
Luckily I wasn't driving and no one got hurt
It happens so fast, in a blink of an eye
It feels weird as heck when you get in a car accident
The best phone calls are the, get ready I'm on my way calls
I repeat things stay being weird
I'm low key nervous to open up these snap chats <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
This is definitely a weird Monday
There are too many things that catch me off guard. I have no reaction on how to respond
I was shocked it was still In there
That 5 bucks I found was literally in the car since November or december
I need to refocus
My mindset has been somewhere else lately
<OK HAND SIGN> to knowing pro skaters and getting free boards
@blxcklunged I got the other 5 let's go
I always think I'll remember it but I always end up forgetting
I don't know why I think it's a good idea to hide my money around my room when I'm drunk I always lose it
Never can go wrong with pizza
You talk like your words are gold
I'm not the fool you think I am
This blunt I rolled god damn
@jenrodriguez_ you already know got it on lock down
@jenrodriguez_ yeah it looks nasty lol
@jenrodriguez_ hell yeah it does it hurts to move it haha no one said it'll hurt after<FEARFUL FACE>
@jenrodriguez_ I know but this little shithead feels dead haha
My arm feels great being out the cast but the stiffness of it makes me wish it was back in the cast
@vineeters hell yeah! Here right now
Banging it on the wall and using a hanger doesn't work
I have no temper right now for this cast it's like chicken pox underneath
I remember putting it there somewhat but I don't remember when I put it there or why I did in the first place
So I found my wallet... behind the curtain on the window.. I bet I was drunk
Dont waste my time
Best part about yesterday was skating on the walk of fame, too smooth
It's a weird feeling when someone else besides yourself buys you a rave ticket
In the end everyone's just looking out for themselves
So I'm going to 420 fest I have amazing friends
Everytime I go to Hollywood something awesome happens
The only person that will understand your true happiness is yourself
Got back into writing poems again
I really wanna see the northern lights
@mariah_foss hi mom<WAVING HAND SIGN>
I love having a guy best friend
He doesn't understand my fear of sprinkles
"Just because you ate something and threw up from it doesn't mean you'll throw up again" advice from a 6 year old.
I was such an alcoholic that last few days I lost my wallet and didn't even notice until days later
I've been thinking so weird lately I don't even like how I've been thinking.
I want silence <HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Little kids be asking too many questions
Mommas the real mvp though
Breakfast in bed <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Thank god I broke my fever though
Laying in bed unwillingly is so boring
This fever has me feeling like I'm a volcano
I'm literally crying bc my chest hurts
Being sick on Easter sucks
I'm so exhausted
So happy I can drink soda again
Maybe we shouldn't have chanted dui in the beginning of the day
Things are all better<OK HAND SIGN>
I never get mad but tonight I was scared getting to that point I was at
"Well I have to be a bad boy because my dad is a bad boy" you're less than a man than he is
What does fighting all the time prove? That you got hands? You're fucking a joke and childish, violence is weak, you're weak.
Youre 20 idk why you acting like you just gone through puberty
Im trying to ignore this anger but it keeps going back
Done.
I'm to that point where I need to punch a wall
I don't give a flying fuck on how drunk you are you don't treat me like that period
I'm scared to cough bc it hurts
Remember the person you use to be before you judge someone
My frustration right now is no joke
I'm pissed I have to wait another week with this cast<ANGRY FACE>
I always get sick wtf is up with that
This sore throat is killing me
Uhh
Smoking when your sick gets you so fucked up
Oooooope.
Sometimes I just wanna chuck my battery across the room to give it an extra kick since it sucks
Majority of my friends are either Geminis or cancers
The things I sign myself up for <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
I'm the babysitter tonight gotta take care of the homies
I love how showers fix everything
I've been drinking a lot so I can gain
But they'll still funny

Goodnight world
Guys are funny

How do you burn a cup of noodle? Give it to Ricky and youll see the cup all black and burnt <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You're going go have to call food control so I can eat your food
Raided the kitchen
And it's too hot , how did I get in a garage

When cops come up to you, you know it's real
They are talking nonsense

I'm lower
Haha I'm on a different level then these folks
My mom's so cute
I'm just smiling dont think it's anything
Why guys are betterr than girls haha
I'm getting a lecture right now
Literally chewing two different gums to get two different flavors
I love the taste of beer any kind of it
Blunt and beer<OK HAND SIGN><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I'll be back this weekend hopefully <VICTORY HAND>
People are getting dreams done and are so much cooler than people out here
Ever since I went to LA I feel relieved
I should tie them on my house key along with my lighter
I always lose my headphones
@dekkastaxxx aha damn lucky, next time will only be more fun ahh <DANCER><OK HAND SIGN>
I only have a couple of friends that are down as fuck, those are rare to find!

@dekkastaxxx let's do it again!
Got my adeventure in for the day
I like meeting new people with unique names
But this train though took forever <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
Today was pretty fun
Every time I send nick snaps of me singing he records the exact song and sends it back, he's real<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Tuesdays are my adventure days
I wanna bust a mission to downtown
It's gets me real mad when people say f the police, no, fuck you.
All I got to say is beware for tomorrow <WINKING FACE>
I got use to it so much it's gonna be weird without it
It's going to be bittersweet when I get this cast off Friday
I moved so many times without realizing it
This deep thinking has me feeling like a fish under the sea
Think about all the times in a day your body changes to make yourself comfortable again
You've hurt me enough for me to not like you
If something was truly real it'll always be there
Waking up from this 5 hour nap got me so confused
It feels so weird to text my boss
Got a clearer picture of what I want and what I don't want
That security guy last night was too guts
Hopefully I got this in the bag
This test is gonna kill <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
<PISTOL> me
Ducked up
"Not bad juju, bad mojo"
Bottom to top
Front to back
Back to back
Telling someone they're too skinny is just like telling a fat person they're fat.
My phone battery sucks ass
I love the dress ri got for prom
I'll be back
Brea has the hotties <WINKING FACE>
One day I'll finally change the world and they will finally believe me
Hopefully I don't fall in the shower I can hardly stand <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Haven't drank like this in a while
What did I do
Found this note in my ipod from 3 years ago.. crazy <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
I thought that was long gone so weird!!
Thinking you forever lost something then coming home and seeing it.. mind blown.
Wish I would of found out the trains fun sooner
Saw my life flash before my eyes
I always come so close to car accidents happening while I'm in the car
It felt weird too
Explains why I shouldn't be driving
The fact I straight got caught up made me bust up laughing
Thanks boo boos
My mom stays coming in clutch
Back to shhhleep
Woke up hella early now I'm already tired
I'm crispy
Something I'll never do is cheat on someone just nope
I just wanna go in the water.. so tempting
It's too hot for me to be here right now
all the food that I had last night had me k.o.
Just ate a shitload of food these munchies are no joke
Good thing for a cast though
No brainer Julie
I always do shit that I question myself why im doing it
If I don't have snacks on me at all times I feel incomplete
Never leave my mind
It's so sad when I get mega munchies and spend my money on loads of food
Woke up an hour ago and barely getting out of bed, today's going to be a long day..
I lost the motivation to go to class now
I hardly ever stay out late now
Odessa- I will be there<TWO HEARTS>
I get so tired now I take a lot of mini naps
She's only going to be gone for 2 days and I already miss her<CRYING FACE>
I'm too jealous of ri right now going camping
Got a bundle of energy today
Take fucked up and times it by 10 that was me at beyond
The pictures I'm getting all I'm thinking is damn I don't remember this at all<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Lie
Lie
Lie
I push people away like no other when I'm sad, I rather be alone.
Before you react, know the story.
The blurry moments I dont remember are all coming back to me
Dry cough is the worst
That cheese quesadilla with jalapeñoes was 
I don't like this feeling.
I hate when you recognize someone but you were too fucked up to remember who they are or where you saw them from
Feels so good being home and relaxing
This totem is too great<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
This weekend was the best ♡
Ugh this sunburn burns
Ready to party my tits off
Almost slept through my alarm
Don't be fake plain and simple.
If you get butt hurt over the simplest things because im making myself happy, do yourself a favor and jump off a cliff
You should really go back to high school because you're childish as fuck.
Bout to burst.. I have to pee so bad
My eyeballs hurt
But Disneyland today was too fun
Leave it to me always doing things last minute
Finally got paid now I'm all ready
@justin_jmnz but gives you the shits<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
It's getting closer and closer
Up and open to try new things
Ice cream for breakfast

Getting closer and closer
I can't keep myself together
Back to back good things are happening love this feeling, sending positive vibes to all <TWO HEARTS>
Friends are definitely surprising me lately I'm lost of words how positive everyone is being.
I just want to go to beyond already
Good day in San diego
I've been reconnecting with old friends a lot lately it's mind blowing me
Smoked a blunt all the way through and no one tapped out <OK HAND SIGN>
Girls handle problems way better than guys
My arm feels like dead weight <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
If I still talk to you, you still mean something to me
I don't hate you, we just grew away from each other
@LongLoveDeezy yes yes and yes, you? :) we will definitely rage then!
@LongLoveDeezy yeah we want to rage with you too! Hopefully you can make it that'll be awesome :) no problem <OPEN HANDS SIGN>
@LongLoveDeezy so how did things go? :)
I haven't moved for my bed all day it kidnapped me
No matter what the situation is or where we left off if you need me, I'll be there.
When you're trying to find weed and everyone is lagging <FEARFUL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
One mountain two mountain.. 4 and 5 mountain the pimple population is growing
Bundle on joy is happening on my chin pimps for days
You got too high that you don't remember how much you smoked dumbass
I keep thinking today's Saturday
@mariah_foss mom's there u better hurry before she leaves
All the people we meet yesterday were from out the state and different countries it was pretty cool

Looking at my cast, I have some djs that signed it
I'm white but god damn white girls when they're drunk are annoying
I always end up meeting cool people

It's one thing to have a cast but to have an itch that you can't get to ughh <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>

Pregaming before work
@mariah_foss I don't see you up when I'm up. Dude I miss you too you have to warn a soul when you're not coming home!
"@mariah_foss: I wake up at 8:30 everyday no matter what<NEUTRAL FACE>" biggest f^cking lie
Can't contain myself
Is my bed playing a prank on me because I can't get out.
I feel like everytime I'm talking to my dad about weed or when it comes on the news and we're discussing it, my mom gives me the death stare
"@girlideas: me as a parent 
I just get so in my world no one will stop me
Sometimes when I get too many messages and notifications I just stare at it because so much is going on
Unbelievable picked up 10 grams and I'm almost done
Straight up got caught in a lie and laughed then hung up
Idk how I got here or how I remembered on how to get here but I did
My memory is like my personal GPS
This wind made my room feel like a ice box
Welp this is early for me
5 more days gahhhh I'm getting so anxious
My food combinations are so weird it looks like I eat like a pregnant person
This prime rib sandwich is babe
I wonder... when random thoughts happen, when Im thinking of someone out of the blue if they thought about me randomly too
Working after Christmas is torture

Meatloaf meatloaf I hate meatloaf
Maybe hiking killed me
I keep falling asleep I'm not sure why I'm so tired
I love watching documentaries
I wish I could read people's minds so I wouldn't waste time
That nap was a bad decision
My pimps decided to play connect the dots on my face
I love group conversations with the right people
My eyes burn because I'm so tired still
Feels like I've known you longer than I have
I love those friends you can be having no conversation with and not get bored of them
Ricola
Haven't even started Christmas shopping <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Do you because that's all that matters, screw what everyone says/wants you to do, it's your life not theirs. Do what makes you happy.

I literally have my laptop on my lap, but I'm choosing to eat over studying
Still haven't started.. <SLEEPY FACE>
Was supposed to start studying 2 hours ago and I'm still watching tv..

Honey why are you calling me so late
Why is healthy food disgusting and junk food so good?
I don't understand I'm tired but I can't sleep
@mariah_foss dude I know she scares me
I always have to prepare myself mentally when I chug protein shakes
She reacts too easy yall need to chill
My mom irks my buttons
@Amaris_Aguilar you need to come visit! I miss you and your happiness!

Why would you peel out right in front of a cop knowing you have weed in your car? Hmm it was probably not the best idea.
Out and about
Screw that paper I'm not going to worry about it
Why why whyyy must I procastinate to the last minute ugh
Just thinking about writing this paper makes me want to do anything but it.
Stop spending time wanting to do things, go out and do them.
She always looks confused when she finds out my real plans <NEUTRAL FACE>

I need to stop telling my mom the truth when im high, when I'm trying to tell her a lie

I don't even remember falling asleep, I guess I was tired
Why are regular clothes more comfy than actual pajamas?
"If i could inject red Bull into my veins I would"

Asking too many questions annoys the crap out of me
I'm supposed to be studying <GRIMACING FACE>
I hate how I love you
Can you exit the building and return so I get a second view <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
The amount of energy I get at night makes me question where it comes from..
And it feels even better making people happy
I like seeing people happy

The energy I have right now feels like my mind is jumping off the walls
Too guts
Mariah just hopped in when I was taking a shower..
Is it sad that I'm actually trying to buy my parents a getaway so they can leave the house for a week?
At least I can say I'm smoking the good shit if you can smell it, would I be in less trouble?

Walked in the house and made the whole house smell dank asf sorry mom and dad

My parents were talking to me while I was completely zoned out what did I just say okay too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That 10 minute nap saved my life
I should have stayed asleep and not got that water
Do you ever get mind blown when you barely notice something that's always been in front of you?
Don't fuck with ghost peppers
You know something is extremely hot when you makes you cry uncontrollably
Love how my purse fits my bong
It's funny how our bodies feel the good/bad vibes before we even get to experience it.
Took a whole lot of convincing
Can Wednesday like hurry up? Thanks
It was all just a love game
I feel like my bong became my child or something because now I'm always taking care of it making sure it doesn't break
Some people are just not meant to cross paths with you.
That paycheck was worth every penny yesterday <OK HAND SIGN>
I'm so out of it and it's only 3
That scooby snack was woah a creep
I suppose I should get ready now
I'm fucked I have work in 30 minutes
Paranoid people kill the vibes
I tried fighting it but next thing you know I wake up wondering wtf happened
That nap was a disaster
Now I'm debating whether to sleep or eat
It's really sad how I debate on either getting food or getting weed with the rest of my money
Or cloud?
What planet am I on?
On some type of space nebula
When you have to use eye drops from smoking, then you know you smoked good <EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN>

This yik yak app is pretty entertaining
Feels so good to just chill
I talk to so many strangers it's nice hearing each of their stories from time to time.
It's crazy how much truth you can learn about someone in seconds
Ranch is just one of those things you can never have too much of it
Going on a cruise sounds so fun about this time.
They should name a strain the sleepwalker
Beer beer and more beer
Getting 10 bucks is so much easier than getting 20 bucks from my mom
Why ruin someone's day when you're upset and take out your stress on them? They don't deserve your selfishness.
I need to vent seriously but I have no one to vent to
Seriously I haven't got mad in a while but that text pissed me off.
You're stirring the pot for attention
We are adults now, I think it's your turn to prove you've matured and to stop running your mouth about lies.
Fuck I'm so drunk I have to wake in a few hours
Yiu win
Instead of bad blearing vision

It's always good keeping your calm for a while and then just releasing it all out and having fun for a weekend
I'm so motivated to gain weight that before every meal I make myself a protein shake, I don't know if it helps but It's a start
I always forget the things I have to do
I'm so confused everything im doing feels like a dream
How'd I get where I was right now
Long time no see cloud 9
Sneak attack, caught me I'm tired as crap
Can i have a huge ass bed to fall asleep on
Wheezing* lol

Last big event until edc
I'm going all out with a bang
Gosh tomorrow and this weekend are going to be too on

Mariahs the worst driver
My eyeballs are as big as nemos
Crazy how one person can ruin my day so fast

You can ask me to do something months in advance and I won't do it until the last day
Not in an asshole way though time to meet new people
This weekend I have a plan to photobomb random people's pictures
So weird a thing has been bugging me this whole day and a friend just texted me saying everything will be okay randomly

When I don't want to go somewhere my friends bribe me with food
Gosh I love Steve Aoki
I swear me and Mariah are practically twins
Wasn't even paying attention
When you run into something coming at full force and hitting it, now that pain freakin hurts
We had a twin moment, we said the same thing at the same time and didn't realize til after we said it
I hardly talk to my brother but that conversation right now made me so happy
These tickets are lagging to arrive
Are you going to be the light or the shadow of your life?
I really wish I didn't feel pain I'd be so much happier
Got asked to smoked twice today and denied each one. Yep its happening..
What is love?
Lol at what I just did right now
In a good mood for some reason
I know people better than they know their selves
Now the question is where is it
Whenever I wash my clothes with my socks I always end up losing one sock
I don't care if you sound like a dying seal singing but if you know a song when it comes on sing your heart out
high key excited to not week for a whole week after wednesday
I come to peace

That sandwich I made was disgusting
All businesses should be closed weekends
This break went by so fast I wanna cry back to hell

Bad things happen and then out of nowhere good things happen
There's always a way to get something you truly want
All the money i got is now poof gone
