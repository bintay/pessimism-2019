Better than those fickle LA "fans" who were wearing lakers jerseys a couple years ago. But that's none of my business. Rockets in 6.
Or insanity. Either way, Houston sports will do that to you.
Hard to see the game tonight. But I'm hopeful. Optimistic.  Isn't that what optimism is anyway? Enduring and hoping for the best?
You don't say...

@polierburrr please dude, I expect you to!
@polierburrr they'll need that to shield them from the tears of those bitch ass fans.
@polierburrr good, I expect you here with a twelve pack and a pillow that the @dallasmavs can bite on when we wreck that ASS
@Krystal_Klear except Dallas. They're not texas.
@polierburrr where are you watching the game Sunday?
Hate or love it the underdogs on top. @polierburrr
We're 3-0 without a LEBRON or CURRY. Keep us under the radar and keep doubting us.  Let it be known, we are the true definition, underdog.
@polierburrr no matter how much they wanted us to lose, we persevered.  #RedNationRising baby.
About as predictable as the the two back to back rings that shocked the nba bitch. We are the fucking hype.
@polierburrr who jim carrey? Who cares.  Just let the @nba and @dallasmavs know, THREE AND OH.
@polierburrr dirk getting calls because.....reasons? Motherfucker should be thanking the refs as far as I'm concerned
My @HoustonRockets won.  Chilling with the woman of my dreams. Appreciate life, in every way. Fucking love to all! (Except dallas!)
