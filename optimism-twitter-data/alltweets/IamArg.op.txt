@RobbieandBobby ugh just looking at that gives me a panic attack
@emperorwebrunnr a genuine thanks for that.
Are there sex positive sexy games? Asking for a friend.
@ItsMeJustinBoyd you think she'll say yes?
#BestWifeEver
I forgot to write down a comic idea I had yesterday and then I subsequently forgot it  and Lynn just texted me with what the idea was.
Here's a link to the people that were making those Snes cart key chains. 
@AIRIGOAGAIN you know what. That's them!
Okay Witcher 3 reviews I'll buy Witcher 3.
@AIRIGOAGAIN it looks like it might be them but it was Snes carts.
@LostWithThMusic as soon as I find out I will.
A friend picked me up a Chrono Trigger one because I was stuck at the booth and now I want all of the carts.
Somebody in Calgary was selling Snes Cart Key chains and I want to know if they have an online store so I can buy more.
@TheOnlyTrout the permadeath thing always turned me off from the series till Awakening.
@MVG_Axe your young link is so fun to watch.
@MikeHazeGaming great job on commentary at press start man!
Going to meet our new family doctor today. Good thing we got sick beforehand so we'd have something to talk about.
In this comic, we discover mold in the home... 
.@MVG_Axe 's Young link is insane! That Bomb game. #PressStart @startlan
@RobbieandBobby @ItsMeJustinBoyd @Keithito @rockpapercynic @Lunarbaboon ... awkward...
@ItsMeJustinBoyd @Keithito @rockpapercynic @RobbieandBobby @Lunarbaboon you should came over here and got sick..
@Keithito @rockpapercynic @RobbieandBobby @Lunarbaboon @ItsMeJustinBoyd Thanks for taking justin from me for this weekend.
Next year I'm going to have to double down on the TCAF partying. My body is not ready.
This weekend was sad but at least I got to spend it with my wife how was also sick. She's the best sick buddy.
Sorry to my TCAF webcomic buddies I missed because I was sick. @Lunarbaboon @rockpapercynic @ItsMeJustinBoyd @RobbieandBobby @Keithito
Happy Birthday All Moms!
Spent the day with my sick wife being all sick together on the couch watching sappy movies.
Still feel like crap. Staying home today so I don't infect the rest of the world. Lynn's already starting to get it too.
Honestly the game knows you're a liar if you don't choose that... 
I've been drinking so much fluid that I'm literally just a filter that makes things worse. I've peed 12 times tonight already...
@SuperbitchComic I do that all the time.
How many NyQuil will kill me?
Okay give me that many plus 2 more...
@thebgardiner one long sustained blink means "fuck off"
At least one good thing happened today... Earthbound arrived. 
My throat is on fire. It hurts to swallow and talking is just out of the question...
I was so looking forward to this weekend and now my body is shutting down. So angry...
I just wish the people I need to get a hold of would answer so I can stop panicking and just rest...
Ugh... I'm finally supposed to go see Avengers tonight but I'm actually contemplating skipping it because I feel so terrible...
@emperorwebrunnr I haven't even been to TCAF yet. I may skip it to save everybody the pain.
Yep... Sick again... And on the eve of TCAF...
In this comic, we finally stop listening and join the conversation. 
YAY! Agent carter is renewed!
@hijinksensue stop it. you're getting me hard...
@hijinksensue GOOD POINTS!
I just backed UP and OUT: Volume One! on @Kickstarter 
Gonna turn a tweet into a comic. Recycling is good for the environment!
@LanMikoto i'd love to, but I have make you guys a comic tonight.
@RatedSGames @ScrewAttackBen actually... His power was water... Thank you very much. #pretentiousNerdAlert
@LanMikoto what can I do. Complain? Already did that.
So looks like @RockstarSupport is doing nothing about the hacking of my GTAOnline account... Lost all my preorder cash...
@TheOnlyTrout right???? So fricken crisp!
@tavismaiden don't you have a direct line? Lol.
@blamemarktjan @TweetBravo you're opening yourself up to a world of pain...
@upandoutcomic @NamelessPC @comicsgirls @Glavin13 @ninjaandpirate yeah... All pretty good.
@LostWithThMusic why pick when you can have both!
@rstevens captain of the track team!
@GynoStar that you're an individual with a extremely refined humour palette.
@rstevens true story, I had 2 empty lockers next to me in highschool that I filled with dead Jolt bottles that almost got me suspended...
When you're poopin and pee is all like "Hey, I wanna join this party too!" #JustWasteProductThings
Sometimes you just wanna draw some bewbs.
Last night as I was heading to sleep I had a major one that just pretty much put a stop to falling asleep last night.
Note to those that don't have anxiety issues: you don't need a reason for a panic attack to happen.
Found tomorrow's work playlist. 
Also, Chappie was an alright movie. I enjoyed it. Didn't really need the gratuitous violence. but still good.
I'm an artist. I'm not supposed to code...
Oh fuck... Somewhere along the way I stumbled into some programming...
That face when you discover the hero of time's porn collection. 
That master sword looks like a... 
Some of my faves #Snes 
@ranbrown you're welcome!
I want to have sex with a hamburger. There, am I in the Internet loop now?
That story is still cute.
I'd say Ignore the offensive stolethislaptop.jpg in the 4chan screen but fuck that guy.
@upandoutcomic hmmm that'll work with my schedule.
@upandoutcomic can you get it online in a several? I've got some things to do beforehand.
This. 
@BlasterNation aw yissssssss
Sometimes you act like a 16 year old girl because it's your job and sometimes you act like a 16 year old girl because you want too...
I wish I could post more of my sketches from work but unfortunately they're all under NDA because lol lawyers.
Watching GT Time and sketchin' @dbloodworth2 between renders. 
@starkdesign @fiveironfrenzy so good. I assume You know they're back together?
And sure a lot of their stuff is technically "Christian" the music is still great.
Also they like Canada... And blue combs.
There the only band I know of that has a eulogy song for a band member that is still playing in the band in that very song.
Today's a @fiveironfrenzy day at work.
Still to this day, Chrono Trigger makes me smile and cry.
In this comic, tax season is over... 
@TheQuinnspiracy lol at the "Show more" button
I often have a jaded response to things and then on second thinking I become completely optimistic. Cynical hopeful. Disgusted delight.
@SuperbitchComic naw, fake it till you make it!
So fuck the haters (me included) you make your comic dude. Fucking kill it.
Besides  who am I to tell someone they shouldn't make a webcomic.
I... I didn't have the heart to tell him.
Guy at game store that wants to make an "original webcomic different than all the ones already out there. It's from a geeks perspective."
I literally had to go to the creators website (which is okay, lulz traffic) then click their link to their patreon.
Literally putting the creators name from the confirmation email @patreon sends into their search bar returns no results...
The crazy hoops you have to go through to support people...
Why is finding any creator or creation on @patreon the hardest thing in the world...
@Tautologicaly yes my queen.

Any support I get goes to more animated films/l…
@samandfuzzy There's a lot of backlash in the animation community right now about fair working conditions. a lot of animators just quit.
Ugh... damn you internet... I think I was just spoiled something...
@LostWithThMusic technically you're not wrong.
@LostWithThMusic there's repo carts that can play on NTSC systems.
Next on my list is Metal Warriors, Terranigma and a repo cart of Secret of mana 2 (Sieken Denetsu 3)
Bit the bullet and bought a cart of Earthbound. I should have never have given that game up.
@RobaatoX I still hold out for another Tobal game.
@paulwestover I washed my hands after reading it.
@Lunarbaboon @Keithito @Lubchansky @RobbieandBobby @ItsMeJustinBoyd @mkhoddy wear it over our bugsona. We can be rural Katy in the big city
@Keithito @Lubchansky @RobbieandBobby @Lunarbaboon @ItsMeJustinBoyd @mkhoddy I have a Google alert specifically to be on top of TCAF<TRADE MARK SIGN> trendz
@Lunarbaboon @RobbieandBobby @ItsMeJustinBoyd @Keithito @Lubchansky @mkhoddy you do have the nicer legs.
@RobbieandBobby @ItsMeJustinBoyd @Keithito @Lubchansky @mkhoddy @Lunarbaboon I call Katy
Had to explain Jem and the Holigrams to someone today and now I feel very old...
@DrunkenNovice not lately. But yes that's a trend with me.
In this comic, our insides are revolting... 
@paulwestover That's a lot fluids in that latest dorkly... bravo
@upandoutcomic your ideas intrigue me and I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
@upandoutcomic cancelling my pledge now. Ugh... Such elitism.
@blogTO @TorontoComics crowds...
@Chronoti also you can order games online for a decent price at @LukieGames
@Chronoti I go to @acgamesonline all the time. the amount of retro stuff they have is ludicrous
I'm just a huge fan of those Batman games. I'll buy all the DLC if it means Rocksteady gets to keep making games.
I'm also the guy that pre-ordered a Batman PS4 just for that game.
I'm gonna buy that $40 Batman Arkham Knight Season pass because I want to spend my money that way.
@LanMikoto Lisa needs braces!
finally something with nickleback that I like... 
@Kitchingham I did
Oh wow... They spent all my preorder cash I had...
With like 2 hours played and an online rank dispite me never having been online at all.
I think somebody hacked my Rockstar Social club account... was playing the single player and suddenly I had an Online character.
@Rosscott in that case, I retract my snarky tweet.
@Rosscott more like 4...
@Deesing that's fair.
@DRainford the story is shit, but the gameplay is awesome. Sea battles are great.
Ah man, Metal Warriors for the Snes just had to be a super rare game...
@Fluxfoxphoto ah. Naw. I've got a bunch of freelance and comic work to do.
@Fluxfoxphoto fair?
@rstevens I am rstevens95.
Sleeping only 2 hours last night was not a good idea... I think I should go home...
If you come across one of the NSFW ads please send an email with a screenshot.
So apparently there may be NSFW ads floating around on ARG. Haven't gotten reports but tech is on it.
Like 20% of my patreon funds go to supporting other creators on patreon. #payitforward
@SaeedFaridzadeh when plugged into a proper upscaler, Snes games look so crisp. No fuzziness at all.
@SaeedFaridzadeh yeah having it upscale properly on my tv and look great is awesome.
@SaeedFaridzadeh lol. Yeah up until a year ago I never heard of it. But fuck the quality is noticeable.
@zombieroomie ugh... That one.
@zombieroomie I don't mean to take the puss out of it. It was just something I noticed.
@zombieroomie uh... Wut? 
@SaeedFaridzadeh yeah... It's kinda dumb they NA never adopted Scart.
@zombieroomie why does that skeleton have lips?
@SaeedFaridzadeh RGB is the best you're going to get in terms of video quality. In NA we were locked out of it.
@SaeedFaridzadeh the only way to get seperate RGB signals out of a NTSC Snes is through a euro Scart cable.
If anybody needs Scart Cables with Csync for a SNES/N64 apparently I ordered 3...
@LanMikoto sad it'll have no Colin Firth. He made that film.
@Tylertas kinda a failed joke. Like the first time she brings up anal and his reaction was funny. The rest was just meh.
@LanMikoto I did. Good movie overall.
@emperorwebrunnr YARP!
But damn that Church scene... So good.
Like the whole movie is over the top. But that whole scene just feels out of place.
If they had left that princess joke at that first point instead of going back to it. I probably would have a better opinion of the film.
Kingsmen was an insanely well shot action movie. Also as a "spy" film its premise is crazy. It's a shame the last minutes kinda soil it.
In this comic, we talk about our ideal man... 
Okay, I'm 20 mins into Kingsmen and damn this is a well shot movie.
@TheOnlyTrout I'm saving some monies per paycheque so I can buy a copy for myself one day.
Working on tomorrow's comic now... Taking my time with it... I just kinda wanna take it leisurely tonight..
@TheOnlyTrout @dantheshive my biggest regret is trading that big box erfbound for a copy of Final fantasy 3...
@TheOnlyTrout @dantheshive DAT ERFBOUND BOOK
@scottjohnson predator.
Avengers Age of Ultron is Amazing!!!! I haven't seen it yet, I just wanted to beat you all to that tweet.
@TheOnlyTrout I couldn't order from Amazon UK they wouldn't ship to Canada. Hoping my preorders else where stick.
@TheOnlyTrout damn you... I'm still waiting on mine...
Nothing hurts a soul more than charging an attack to level 8 in Secret of Mana and then whiffing.
Oh no... This War of Mine updated with a scenario creator... So long everybody...
If you're getting RGB cables I re come d the Euro Scart with Csync adapter for the mini. They are pretty awesome.
I'm super happy with the Framemeister XRGB mini. With the right cables it's great.
Link to the Past and Secret of Mana look gorgeous in RGB by the way.
Going through all my old Snes carts and testing out which ones still work.
@ChrisHallbeck equip it with grappling hooks my man. GAME. CHANGER.
@canadapostcorp except you have a 10% lost or returned to sender rate...
@TheOnlyTrout RGB for the Snes is the way to go. It looks sooooo good.
Chrono Trigger looks so good on this TV at 720p. Going to play with some settings but damn that game looks great.
It's hard to tell from this picture but Snes thru RGB upscaled to 720p thru the Framemeister is awesome. 
Apparently "frequent service" for the #TTC means 4 busses all arriving at the same time once every hour.
@LanMikoto @TheOnlyTrout gotta do the online and import game. That's how I get mine.
@LanMikoto @TheOnlyTrout it's okay... I own 3 gold marios...
@TheOnlyTrout let's not think of end times.
@TheOnlyTrout noice.
@TheOnlyTrout #agreed
@TheOnlyTrout I found turning the sharpness down on my TV to zero and letting the frame user handle the sharpness was good to.
@TheOnlyTrout make sure you're running in 720p. 1080p with scan lines looks kinda bad right now.
@TheOnlyTrout actually you can adjust the intensity of the lines to a point were you just "Feel" the scan lines.
@TheOnlyTrout it's ridiculous how quick mine arrived. Great shipping.
@TheOnlyTrout it really makes a difference for some games.
Apparently Jared Leto was near where I work yesterday...
@LostWithThMusic I will have both Vol 1 and Vol 2 with me this year at Conbravo
In this comic, NSFW, more like Not Safe for Life... 
@TheOnlyTrout @RyanComics It's MUCH MUCH WORSE
Doing a comic about a true life experience tonight... this'll... this'll be fun.
Writing comics now. It's been a hell of a day...
Smoke's Poutinerie is opening up a hotdog shop called Smoke's Weinerie. #PresentedAsIs
Ugh. Why does Canada post keep sending packages to 2 different post offices. One of which is only open 9-5
Screenshot of Actraiser thru S-Video into a Framemeister upscaling to 720p w/ scan lines added. Can't… 
@ltwario dats the joke.
@TheOnlyTrout ew... I've seen them for 80 around here... That's... That's too much.
Why isn't there a game that is entirely the town building parts in Actraiser??? Indie devs there's a million dollar kickstarter idea.
@TheOnlyTrout gonna have to get it modded.
@TheOnlyTrout oh yah. Just waiting for it.
@TheOnlyTrout also I found an option that allows faux fading at the edges to simulate a crt
@TheOnlyTrout yeah w/o scan lines it's a tad fuzzy up close but from the couch it's great.
Testing out the S-video connection from a SNES into the Framemeister upscaler to 720p w/ scan lines. 
New episode day is my favourite day. I do so much planning and setup and I actually feel accomished at the end of it.
I feel bad for the creative people that are living with the mistakes made by piss poor management.
"LULZ WHUTS A MAGAMEN?" -Capcom
"This silent hill game were making looks great, let's fire our creative lead and cancel the game." - Konami
"everyone wants a decent sonic game with effort behind it, creates cash grab instalment" -Sega
"Everyone's asking for a ff7 remake, let's remake other FFs instead" - SquareEnix
@DrunkenNovice yeah, I ended up pre-ordering the special Arkham knight ps4. Batman deserves a big screen.
Insanely excited for the new batman game. I love that franchise so freaking much.
Sometimes it's just fun to go all out with the overacting.
The show I'm working on likes to cast me as a villain. I like that. There's really fun overacting to be had.
@Jimininstrovich he was obscenely valiant...
@SirDustinTheWin he died though...
Losing your DnD character is heartbreaking... I'm still in shock.
@Dragowar everyone but me.
@Dragowar some were enslaved.
@Dragowar it was a mind flayer. I'm a rogue and I was surrounded and low on health. Crit roll killed me.
@Megzilla87 YARP!
@Dragowar brain eaten on a crit.
And it's not within walking distance... So everything is all messed up..
Usually my bigger mail goes to one PO that's open late.  lately a couple of packages have been going to one of open only 9-5.
@Megzilla87 I'm picking up...
Been at this post office for an hour now... Only moved up 2 spots...
In this comic, we just want to go to the mall with our friends... 
@thehathimself 4 years now
@thehathimself off and on for about an hour... sorting out my taxes too...
I'm trying more "more than 3 Panel" comics to kinda revitalize my enthusiasm.
Comic is taking a little longer than usual. It's nine panels long...
@bubblegumnex HA! at adding the word "complimentary" in the same sentence as the word "tax"
In the long line of formerly great companies... What the hell is Konami doing?
YAY! taxes...
Surf had his brain eaten in a crit.
RIP Surf...
Well my first character died...
Just got a bag of holding!
DnD today!
I was actually down for Leto. Dudes a great actor. I'll give his joker a chance but that picture of the design is yeah... Just bad.
I like that ozzy is the new joker.
@MercWorks liar.
@RyanComics gimme an hour or two...
I ordered 4 chicken fingers and they gave me 6!!! Everything is coming up ARG! *dies of chicken poisoning*
#SkinnamarinkyDoo
#SkinnamarinkyDinkyDink
@rockpapercynic that's fair.
@upandoutcomic @ChrisHallbeck #StoryOfOurLives
@upandoutcomic thank you for the comedy!
I just backed UP and OUT: Volume One! on @Kickstarter 
In this comic, we make some orange juice from concentrate... 
New comic is queued and ready to go. I'm ready to get back into the swing of things...
@Shaggyshan I guess I should buy it then...
Gonna draw a dumb comic when I get home tonight. Looking forward to the dumb.
@TheOnlyTrout at least nintendo is kinda listening... Square Enix is fucking oblivious
What the fuck is that company thinking?
Square Enix: sure we can remake that terrible sequel to FF 4 but fuck you if you ask for a Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
@DrunkenNovice ok.
@TheOnlyTrout yeah, Solaris had a combo pack with that cable.
@TheOnlyTrout 
@TheOnlyTrout and check out the my life in gaming channel on YouTube.
@TheOnlyTrout 
@TheOnlyTrout but fortunately there's firmware updates for it consistently. New one just this week.
@TheOnlyTrout it depends. From what I can tell on the ps2 test you need to be in 720p to make it look good.
@TheOnlyTrout did you get the d-terminal cord with it too? It's the only way to hook component to it.
@TheOnlyTrout basically it stops your tv from having to do it's dumb ups along which just ruins everything.
@TheOnlyTrout it's better Less fuzzy b/c the TV is not doing the unnecessary interlacing. But the quality is not as good as RGB or component
@TheOnlyTrout if you've got an hdtv and you've been using composite or, God forbid, RF adapters, the image quality is night and day.
@TheOnlyTrout so you'll have to grab a euro Scart RGB cord adapter. Which if you're spending the money on the XRGB mini you might as well
@TheOnlyTrout the only thing though is the RGB cable that comes with the Framemeister is JP21 and can't be used with reg euro Scart cables.
@TheOnlyTrout N64 you need to mod and game cube it's better to use component cables... But they're like $300+ so using a wii is better
@TheOnlyTrout Snes, n64, gamecube can all use the same RGB Scart cable. But SNES is the only one that natively outputs RGB
@TheOnlyTrout it's expensive and requires a lot of different cords for all the consoles but the image quality is there.
I'm waiting on my Snes Scart cords so I can test Chrono Trigger on my HDTV
Though you kinda have to pay attention and adjust settings per game.
Tried out the XRGB Mini Framemeister last night on my PS2 and N64 and holy hell, with some minor tweaks the games look great.
I'd like to take a moment and thank my incredible readership for showing such great patience over the last couple of months. Thank you.
Spending tonight writing comics. New one is going up Friday. And then next week ARG will return to MWF schedule like before!
I don't know, every time we do trust fall exercises, the earth fails to catch me gently. I don't think it deserves its own day... #EarthDay
Kids in an animation studio are adorable.
These kids are hilarious. They're all sounding out lip sync with their mouths.
There's a class of young kids in the studio right now.
Picked up some Euro Scart cables and adapters and I'm excited to test it out when they arrive.
It always bugged me how crappy Nes and Snes look through composite cables.
Treated myself to an RGB upscaler so I can finally play Snes on my HD screens all nice like. 
Slept most of the day and now I can't sleep...
@blamemarktjan it's not "suggestive" when you're inside me.
@blamemarktjan come get yer grass fed ethically raised organic gluten free no preservatives added chocolate covered fist bump.
Two cons in a row have given me con crud... I might have to go to fist bumps in the future.
Well it finally all caught up with me... Con crud in full effect. I'm going back to sleep.
I finished all the interesting animation last week now all I have is weight shifts and background characters to animate...
@Keithito @Lunarbaboon lol, yeah... He's alright I guess...
@LanMikoto lol no worries. I just thought it was funny. Thanks for the words of encouragement.
@LanMikoto that tweet looked like an ad for smash bros.
@LanMikoto what are you? A copy writer for smash bros?
Back to work.
Almost home. It's gonna be nice to see Lynn again.
@CarversKnife thank you for reading them.
@CarversKnife that's a good friend you've got there.
Back in toronto. Might have to taxi it... Ugh.
@CarversKnife @Calgaryexpo I'll be sure to bring more next time.
So long @Calgaryexpo thank you for the wonderful time.
@ThisIsJThomas dude, great finally meeting you this weekend. Hope you got the hotel stuff sorted.
Finally treating myself  to a nice HD upscaler for my proper consoles at home. Excited.
Plus, I felt less pressured doing sketches this time. Had a lot of fun.
I think doing sketches for tips was worth it. Sure some people under paid what I usually charge but most were very generous.
I love you calgary but I'm excited to get back to my wife.
This fuckin robot eats our secrets
Like Calgary and ECCC are both great shows but if you get shunted into that "other" Artist alley area I can understand your frustration.
It sucks to see one artist alley killing it and the other just barely making table costs back.
I'm a little disappointed that cons are still putting a portion of the AA in a seperate building/floor and not telling anyone.
Calgary... 
So I'm only at my table till 12 today...
Watching TV in the hotel reminds me exactly why I don't have cable anymore...
@JimZub @stacyking you guys are so cuuuuuuuuuuuuute.
Even though I'm totally sick right now, words can't describe how great this weekends been.
Craftin dem Mines. 
All dem Avengers... 
If your going to the calgary Expo on Sunday and wanted to say hi. I'll be at my booth between 10-12.
Alright I found a pub. I'm chilling with a Guinness, some pub grub and then hitting the bed. Day 3 of Calgary was just too good.
@CarversKnife yeah... Geez it's a ghost town
Where the hell is the fast food in Calgary?
@RyanComics likewise dude!
@ThisIsJThomas already met him a bunch of times. Super nice guy.
So I might just take tomorrow off and walk around the con.
@TheOnlyTrout oh god yeah. Calgary is pretty nice.
So yeah sorry guys I'm out of books. You people are too nice.
@deathbulge infinite.
@samandfuzzy likewise buddy. Definitely the best view of the con.
I have 1 vol 1 left and 2 vol 2 left. Calgary needs to calm down.
So I only have a handful of books left at my table. Calgary sure loves them dick jokes.

Interviewer: Do you have a police record?

Me: No. But I do have a few of their albums on cassette

*h…
@samandfuzzy thanks for the follow. How's it going across the aisle?
Everywhere I look all I see is @JimZub 's Wayward.
Also if you have card stock paper and your willing to part with a couple of sheets I'd love you forever.
Also I have to leave at Noon on Sunday so if you did want to say hi to me in Calgary time is passing.
I say "We're setup" but it's just me. I'm alone this weekend. So lonely...
Alright, were setup and good to go at Calgary Comic Con. Table U-01! Come say hi.
Dawn of the 3rd day of Calgary Expo. I'll be in at 9:30 or so at Table U-01
That batman v superman trailer wasn't that bad... Poor timing though...
Also thanks to all the smash fans that stopped by and nerded out about the pro smash scene. You guys are awesome, my wife doesn't get it.
Now I sleep...
Just had a great steak and some great conversation with some great friends. Thanks for a great second day calgary.
Capt America and Jake the Dog Comission done at Calgary Comic Expo. 
Deadpool and BMO commission I did up for a reader! 
Caught a wild jigglypuff but I didn't have a pokeball so I used a plastic bag instead... Should be good. 
Day 2 at Calgary Comic Expo! Come say hi! I'm at Table U-01!
I've seen so many Ever After High Cosplayers so far and it warms my heart.
Just ate far too much sushi and drank some sake that is putting me to sleep... Thanks for the great first day calgary.
@davoerlo but oh what a demise.
@davoerlo it's oddly arousing.
All set up to go at Calgary Comic Expo at table U-01! come by and say hi! 
Nap was quicker than I would have hoped for.
New Star Wars trailer was pretty cool. Old Han shot was kinda meh. But everything else looks great.
@DrunkenNovice I would be entirely okay with that...
Aw yeah checked into the hotel. Now for a quick nap before I head to the con and set up.
Landed in Calgary. Can't wait to hit the hotel and nap for an hour.
see you later Toronto. Off to Calgary Comic Expo.
@blamemarktjan there's a fully formed joke in there somewhere... I'm far to tired to write it now.
@blamemarktjan heh. douche pad... Heh...
@JimZub 9:05 westjet.
@LoadingArtist NOOOOOOOoooooo.....ooooooOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo......oooooOOOOOOOOOoooooo......  . .  .  .   .   .    .    .     .     .     .  No
@LoadingArtist fuck. You. #nowitsinmyhead
I apologize to anyone who sees me at the con today... I'm gonna be a bag of crap...
Made it my gate in record time... And now I wished I slept more.
It's way too damn early...
packing is done... now to go to bed because I gotta wake up in 3 hours and fly...
@CarversKnife @Megzilla87 it's a thing we have.
@zombieroomie last year I was able to put one case inside the other and come back in ease.
@zombieroomie one case is filled with 60 books and the other is EVERYTHING else.
@zombieroomie it's keeping the weight under for me.
This is why I like local shows like #Conbravo I can bring everything to it and not stress about it.
Trying balance 2 luggage bags with all my stuff and merch is redonkulous.

ToonBoom Harmony has gone subcription? That's sale right there.
@Tautologicaly my school had a class for doing freelance, invoices, taxes, networking all the business of art.
@Tautologicaly yeah because we tend to value talent. And pay it accordingly.
@Tautologicaly depends on the art training. Like is it fine arts, illustration. I know animators find jobs in multiple fields.

Is there any smash bros going down in Calgary this weekend? I might bring my Wii U...
It's why I love when Lynn is with me. She can talk and handle the both stuff while I can concentrate on the drawing.
It's a sanity thing for me. I can't run a booth, draw perfect and keep track of everything all at once.
I just feel quicker sketches at a "tip" price point is fair and takes some of the pressure off me.
My thinking is that I'm so filled with adrenaline that my drawings are a little off at cons. I'm not really short on commissions offers.
@VanityGames yeah, I saw that. Most people that get a sketch from me ask for specific things. But it's a great idea for book sketches.
Webcomickers. How has sketches for tips at conventions worked for you? I'm thinking of going with that instead of a fixed price.
In this comic, we ask for some help... 
@davoerlo I know. I know... I'm working on it.
I have this immense guilt over not providing you lovely people with enough quality free entertainment over last 2 months. It's killing me.
Writing some comics. Getting kinda silly. I wanna get back to a 3 comic a week schedule again once I get back from calgary.
So much work to be done before I fly out to calgary on Thursday. Heading into the last push!
And the weather in Toronto just had to be perfect.
Working today! Gotta get all them frames animated!
@Chronoti no prob!
"I was one wrong twitch away from farting. I maintained rectal integrity, and no farts were had." - @TipsyKipsy
We figured it out today... I work anywhere between 80-90 hours a week between everything I do...
@Megzilla87 yes it does... Come on... Admit it... You want to find a key...
@Megzilla87 makes you want to find a key...
Our knight is gorgeous. 
Medieval times!!! 
@Jeff_LPBC_Youth Yes indeed!
And now I'm going to medival times. Today is a great day.
Talk at the school was fun. Scared those students straight!
The gunshow is about to happen. 
@SpiderMonkey20s naw. I like to be hopefully. At least for a day.
@GreyTheTick a little of both. I love the work I do. But it's a lot of work.
Going to my old anim college to do a talk on life in the industry after school.
In this comic, things get a little bananas... 
Also Daredevil is violent and good. Crazy to think this is in the MCU.
Okay I have a comic ready to go for tomorrow. I just need to finish off the word balloons. But now I go to bed.
@TheIdDM brutal in a good way
Holy hell, Daredevil is brutal...
Next weekend I'll be in Calgary for @Calgaryexpo I'll be at table U-01!
Stress is not conducive to my lifestyle.
Ugh... I think I'm getting sick again...
@TheOnlyTrout yeah... I just ordered them too...
@TheOnlyTrout bricklink is gonna blow up with T2L collectors. Plus all the customs...
@TheOnlyTrout NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOÔÖÒÓØŌÕOOOOOŒÒØŌOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo...ooOOOOOOOOôöòOOOoOOOoOOOoooooOooOooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo...
@DrunkenNovice actually that's the least stressful one.
@DrunkenNovice naw crazy animation workload versus con prep versus webcomic versus con flu versus wife versus trying to exist.
LEGO Dimensions... well... I'm screwed...
I can't wait to have free time again and I can do things like sleep a normal amount of sleep or hang out with my wife...
@KtShy mouse trap is going to just destroy your mind.
@KtShy that's a comfortable rock you've been living under
I know... I'm complaining about big boobs...
Got a new banner and stand for Calgary. It always bugged how big Lynn's boobs were on the old one.
We have to call on our governments to stop this gross injustice. people in this world  go to bed without. Amiibo is a human right!
@daveexplosm it's criminal not to watch it.
@Freshmin2 God can't save you now...
@Freshmin2 it's you.
In case you all missed it. I updated my Smash 4 print. 
@Buttercuperica @Lunarbaboon @DrinkingQuest man all my friends get asked to do cool things...
Oh sure Wave 4 just had to go up on Amazon Canada today...
This is me at work today... 
Crazy sinus headache today. It's one of those piercing ones that come and go and regular painkillers can't do shit.
@_AquaBat Google the fire emblem awakening box art.
I just hope the new Deus ex launches on PC at the same time as consoles...
I'm so excited for more Deus Ex. I loved Human revolution.
@LostWithThMusic I sowwee...
@LostWithThMusic YEP!
Here's the Updated Smash 4 Print! Now with Lucas! 
@davoerlo @zombieroomie they're all the same expression.
@davoerlo @zombieroomie really everybody should have a sexdoll. I'm my wife's.
@zombieroomie sexdoll
I'm gonna be a happy man once Calgary is over.
Finally leaving work now... So tired.
Just sent @Megzilla87 a bunch of shrugging gifs and challenged her to a SHRUG OFF!
Working super late tonight. Woot! Woot!
@MercWorks @NamelessPC @upandoutcomic after April I should have some free time.
@Keithito yinovas I hear are pretty good.
@MercWorks @NamelessPC @upandoutcomic one of these days I wanna jump in and drink and draw with you guys.
@MercWorks @NamelessPC @upandoutcomic ugh, I wish I had time to watch.
@upandoutcomic I have a lot of issues...
@upandoutcomic Scott bakula.
@upandoutcomic the fear that I'll go crazy and I won't know I'm crazy and the world will know me as that crazy guy.
@upandoutcomic everything around me suddenly becoming sentient and out for my demise.
@upandoutcomic small children in oacks
@upandoutcomic the inevitable heat death of the universe.
@upandoutcomic that my kids will be boring.
Trying to get to work and public transit is not helping at all... #TTC
@EndangeredComic there's nothing like small water fowl on a bear to get my motor running.
@EndangeredComic sorry, I'll stop making requests...
@TrailCreations I was under NDA.
Stayed up way too late drawing. It's gonna be a fun day at work animating pretty princesses.
I think I'll also throw in Fem villager too as I have the other pallete swaps. (male wii fit, koopalngs, alph, mii fighters)
It's not that I don't like the old version. I just kinda stopped halfway because of just the sheer amount of characters in it. 63 characters
Spent the night doing tweeks and adding Lucas to my massive smash 4 print. It's starting to look a lot tighter.
@LanMikoto 
Just realized I have to update my giant smash 4 print with Lucas...
@blamemarktjan okay. But then can I help with the disaster relief?
Apparently a group at wonder on was cosplaying as the characters in the show I'm working on. That's so cool.
@NamelessPC there's no limit as long as you're a responsible dubstepper and pick up all the bass droppings afterwards.
@NamelessPC just set it to some dubstep and nobody will notice the runtime.
@NamelessPC it's called editing...
Also I'll upload a process vid I did last week after ECCC
I just noticed some of the patreon updates for the last few comics haven't gone through. I'll fix that tonight.
This was the picture I took that inspired today's comic. Inspiration comes from everywhere folks. Always be writing. 
Ugh... Stale tea biscuit. Thanks @TimHortons
In this comic, we have a big question to ask... 
@Glavin13 @XtraFabComix @EndangeredComic @RyankHudson @Lunarbaboon @devinboscole @TubeyToons but guys, what about all the tough daily lives?
@XtraFabComix @EndangeredComic @raindogcomic @ninjaandpirate @Glavin13 @Lunarbaboon @TubeyToons trying to find a translator...
@XtraFabComix @EndangeredComic @raindogcomic @ninjaandpirate @Glavin13 @Lunarbaboon @TubeyToons I think they stole one of mine too.
@Lunarbaboon I say, let God sort it out.
Con crud dissipating... Head less snotty. Still a bit achey. But now I can taste things.
@EndangeredComic wow, that is a massive dick move.
@guigar glad you enjoyed it! That made my con flu infested day so much better!
Comic is done. just needs some script edits and a blog post written. I'm going to nap for a bit then I'll finish it off
Body is 90% aches.... Head is 75% snot.... It's a sit in front of TV and watch the entirety of band of brothers and get better kind of day.
Just woke up... Con flu is wrecking me. Conventions are a young man's game. going back to bed. Happy easter...
Con crud has hit hard. Webcomicker down. Webcomicker down.
@blamemarktjan oh no. Let's not go there. This convo is all love.
@blamemarktjan oh yeah. she's super cool. she ain't no bigot.
@blamemarktjan I don't think she gets this love between us. but she seems cool with it.
@blamemarktjan yes. But the wife is here and she's starting ask why Twitter is turning me on.
@blamemarktjan you make me blush.
@blamemarktjan I had to fix that typo.
@blamemarktjan it's not the size but the sincerity of your LOVE that matters.
I've been working for 16days straight now. I'm taking one night off...
I have tomorrow off work. So I'm going to be making comics. Tonight I'm going to play some well needed video games.
@TheOnlyTrout @samandfuzzy yeah, I've doing the import game, it's rough. But at least I'm getting them.
I already have a ness Amiibo. 
The studio is doing an Easter egg hunt and I want to replace all the fake eggs with real ones...
@starkdesign Temba, his arms wide.
@TimHortons I actively avoid your stores now because of the people accosting to sign you up for credit cards while you're in line.
Here's a pic of the little guy in his prime. RIP Darmok. 
Our last water frog Darmok passed away some time in the last week.
@d20monkey sup
This War of Mine is on Sale on Steam. Go buy it. It's a great game.
@tavismaiden Next time. I will ask for a Mike Jones. I don't know why Nintendo hasn't done more with the Startropics franchise.
@tavismaiden MIKE JONES'LL CREAM ZODA!
@MrBrofield I kid. Everybody gets all the characters!!!
@MrBrofield no. Snake had his chance and blew it.
Fuck Goku though. He'd be OP in smash. #HighschoolArguements
Also Ridley, Daisy, Waluigi, Nesster, Shovel Knight, Geno, Mallow, Booster, Grit, Isaac, Chrom and Crono.
My vote goes to Mike Jones for Smash.
JK bring back the climbers.
JK RIDLEY ENGULFS YOUR TV SCREENS!
JK IT'S YOUR BOY ROY!
The obvious candidate for the smash ballot is pichu, AMIRITE???
@TheOnlyTrout yeah. I'm doing the "one per" at two places to be safe.
@TheOnlyTrout I got mine. So I'm all good.
@TheOnlyTrout oh man. We picked the wrong hobby.
@TheOnlyTrout so good!
Man those yarn amiibos. It's combining my obsession with Lynn's Obsession.
I'm so happy there's going to be character balancing in smash 4 still.
@TheOnlyTrout Runbow is great. I play tested an early version last year. Fun times!
A lot of this indies look really fun. #NintendoDirect
I have picked a bad obsession. #Amiibo
My wallet is in pain right now...
I want @trintran 's t-shirt.
Boo to retailer exclusive Amiibo....
Fucking LUCAS!!!!!
@rockpapercynic ugh... Stick to telling jokes comedy boy.
Descent into con flu complete in 3...2...1...
Also good on Instagram letting me know that someone was trying.
Nice try dude in Belarus trying to hack my Instagram account. Those Amiibo and gamecube controller pics are still mine.
I love today.
Gold certified nerd here! 
In this comic, nice try... 
I can at least tell you I'm making you all a lovely comic tonight.
So since I have this friday off. I'm going to make the most of it. #HAHAHAHAHA #YEAHRIGHT
When the song you're listening to syncs up perfectly to the construction outside and you release it as a single under the name skrillex.
"You should get people to nominate you for a Harvey Award." HAHAHA Like I'll ever win a Harvey award with my comic.
@Megzilla87 you're the goods, Meg!
So you can play PacMan on Google maps now. Productivity gone...
@StevenBeargal I ain't gonna tell.
Because I'd probably die .
Why can't it be ECCC everyday.
@Lunarbaboon back pack my man!
Going to draw up a comic tomorrow night after work. I think I have a bit of the con crud.
Back in toronto now. Thanks to everybody who stopped by at #ECCC!
@Chronoti yeah. That's the only decent thing about Pearson. The rest of it is expensive and terrible.
West coast airports &gt; East Coast Airports
@buttersafe suave Scott knows where it's at.
Shout out to my boyd @ItsMeJustinBoyd who put up with my shenanigans all weekend.
@rockpapercynic don't forget your space Suit! Ah dang it, too late....
@tavismaiden great chatting with you for the short time we could. Conventions are just not conducive to getting to know people better.
Some of Brad Guigar's ladies I drew in the copy of my book I gave him. 
@davoerlo ugh. No fun at all.
Headed to the airport now. So long Seattle. You were great to us. Till next year!
This weekend @ItsMeJustinBoyd dubbed me the meanest Canadian. I'm... I'm okay with that.
@jeffcouturier I'll stop by and say hi for sure!
@jeffcouturier dude. I didn't even know you were like literally beside me.
Lynn drew sailor Jupiter for our friend Gabby! 
Another itsmejustinboyd and I collab. This time lady and the tramp. 
Thank you so much @emeraldcitycon for the incredible weekend. Met so many great readers and had a blast. Now we sleep!
More readers bought us LEGO Tribute! 
. itsmejustinboyd and I have been doing collab commissions all weekend and they are glorious! 
Heading to the con in a bit. Having a rough morning.
I apologize to anyone tomorrow for my lack of voices tonight completely destroyed it.
We invented a new sex move called the Big Mac. Here's a visual demonstration. 
Great times at the six arms pub!!! 
Wound up at the six arms pub like always.
Great 2nd day of #ECCC ! Thanks to everyone who stopped by and said hi or bought something! Now... We drink!
@themalloman @tavismaiden @pvponline @choochoobear loved it dude! Great idea!
Stayed in last night instead of drinking. And my body is so much happier for it.
Day 2 of @emeraldcitycon is soon to begin.
Some readers brought us lego!! 
Great first day of #ECCC!
@StairwellOnline I had surgery. I was cutting people with my chin in bed.
@StairwellOnline @zombieroomie @woodyafterhours @buttersafe @invisiblebread I was shaking in fear all day.
I have the best wife.
Ah man Seattle. You treat me well.
Meet the ARG spokesmodel. 
Justin is the most handsome man. 
Sexy times at the six arms pub.. 
The first Starbucks is the worst Starbucks. It doesn't even have the new logo. 
All this gum and not a flavour I like... 
Just got to the hotel. Crazy busy day. Might go get badges and set up soon.
Also I'm stealing this weather.
Happy that all our bags made it to Seattle as well.
And we've made it to Seattle!
@cscomics mwah! Right on yer bum bum.
Landed in Vancouver! Almost there!
Oh man! They have another show I worked on on this flight! #Waybuloo
Ha! They've got the show I used to work on on this flight. #OHNOitsanalieninvasion
Phew made it just in time for our flight. See you later Toronto.
If you're wondering where I am after the show each night, just go to The Six Atms Pub on Pike. I'll be drinking cheap beer.
So yeah. Maybe I'll catch some zeds on the plane.
...time to do a full Friday of convention and then obviously I went out drinking with everyone.
My first time going to ECCC I was stuck in Buffalo for 24 hours and didn't sleep and then flew across country. Made it just in...
had like half an hour sleep last night. This is going to be an interesting trip out to seattle. Not as bad as my first trip out there.
Hooray for no sleep.
In this comic, the miracle of creation! 
Comic: Done. Laundry: Done. Packing: In progress Sleep: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAhahah Nope.
@Fluxfoxphoto 
@LanMikoto ha! she's got enough on her plate.
My goal this weekend is to wear nothing but smash bros t-shirts.
Okay... Now to print stuff, make a comic, do laundry, pack and somewhere in there get some sleep...
@SpiderMonkey20s I hope you like the show.
@SpiderMonkey20s hey! Where did you get that gif of me?
@ironpinky nice! Thanks!
Joaquin Pheonix reacting to the Alien on TV in the movie Signs is my base emotional state.
@ironpinky what do you charge for commissions? I've been dying to get one from you but I always miss Ya.
@ltwario rapture was just a setback!
When a spam gives an order a slave obeys...
spam email with the subject line "Would you kindly email us your account info" so of course I handed over everything...
There needs to be a Garfield for everyday of the week. Wednesday's suck too. #Equalityforallweek
Oof... Just realized I got to be up at 5:30 to be on time for my flight tomorrow. Not fun.
@SamWise_04 thanks! With our history of trying to get to Seattle in the past it's very much appreciated.
Last day before I fly out to Seattle. Entering panic mode in 5...4...3...
That's assuming those panels are approved. But I'm excited to talk about both.
So at @TweetBravo I'll be doing two panels. One on breaking into webcomics and one on breaking into Animation.
@paulwestover 
Had a meeting with the director about my scenes. zero acting calls. Made everyone laugh. Good day is good.
@mkhoddy @RobbieandBobby @caitlindmajor @ItsMeJustinBoyd @RyankHudson @buttersafe @paulwestover @DenisJCaron All lego. No megablocks.
@RobbieandBobby @mkhoddy @caitlindmajor @ItsMeJustinBoyd @RyankHudson @buttersafe @paulwestover @DenisJCaron Only if we can talk lego
@Megzilla87 I'll be in in a bit. Had to run an errand. But we can lunch at like 1 if that's cool.
@Megzilla87 someone owes you money...
Gonna bring some new comic prints to #ECCC this year. All my comic prints are $5 ea.
Purgatory is a barbers wait room.
Also since my wife is going to be joining me for @Calgaryexpo is there anybody down to smash in Calgary?
Okay is there any late night smashbros going down at the Sheraton in Seattle during #ECCC i wanna know if I should pack controllers.
If you haven't watched Rick and Morty we can't be friends.
Holy hell seattle. You weather is going to be gorgeous this weekend.
@themalloman likewise!
Hey! ARG! is going to be in seattle this weekend for @emeraldcitycon We'll be at booth M-10 in the artist alley! Come say hi!
In this comic, we wish for a time machine... 
Tomorrow's comic is a double wide comic. Please no size shaming. Every comic is beautiful.
@cscomics but yeah, expect weekends and late nights. Manage your time right. And you'll stay sane.
@cscomics it's the life we choose. TV is definitely easier than feature. But the quality, obviously is lower.
@cscomics and you can usually do the 9 to 5 thing and be "okay" if you want to push it any further, you're working more.
@cscomics it honestly all depends on where you work. Some shows are crazier than others.
@cscomics I hope you have great time management.
Just finished workin a Sunday. #animatorproblems
@davoerlo Oh no. You guys are why I do this.
Oh man, less than a week till #ECCC! Can't wait to see all my friends again!
#LIKEASUBORDINATE
At work on Saturday. ANIMATING LIKE A BOSS. Wait my boss is here too. ANIMATING LIKE A SUBORDINATE!
I made a bucket list. I'm that guy now. It's alright.
@paulwestover @Skawtnyc Paul Westover is an expert on Clark Gregg.
@Skawtnyc @paulwestover looks like he's got an inflated head.... Again.
@Skawtnyc @paulwestover he should be proud. But not too proud.
It's good to see my buddy @paulwestover getting some Twitter love. I like it when my friends succeed.
@starkdesign yeah. I'm hoping that's the case.
@starkdesign no idea. People think it may be a club nintendo thinger.
@starkdesign yeah all the SMB ones are on the way.
@starkdesign Noice! Good luck man!
@starkdesign ..... yes.
I need an Amiibovention...
@JimZub Makeshift Miracle 2: Make Shift or Miracle Hard
Yay! New contract day!
@SamWise_04 ugh responsibilities suck.
In this comic, we have a dream... 
Comic is almost done but I have to sleep. I'll finish and post it in the morning. Thank you all for infinite patience...
@SamWise_04 thank you.
Another late night at work. My body is shutting down I swear...
The amount of delicious food around my work is dangerous.
Are you animator thinking of starting a webcomic? Cool. I hope time management is a skill you have.
@Keithito @RobbieandBobby in the second act Morgan Freeman hands him keys to a super charged Segway. Blart retorts "Does it come in black?"
@RobbieandBobby christopher Nolan directs. Hans Zimmerman scores. Every intense moment accented with a BLAAAAAAAAAARRRRRT!
@Shareyaworld naw. I'm alright.
@RobbieandBobby I think that's the last thing any of us want.
@Tautologicaly I humbly decline.
This world could do with a lot more humility.
Hey you guys going to @emeraldcitycon next week? I'll be there at table M-10 in the Artist Alley! Come say hi!
I was so exhausted last night when I went to bed that it kept me up all night...
Oh man. Just hung with some old work buddies from the last studio I was at. I miss them.
Today is my petulant man child day.
@timrlai no. Because I only just heard of this now. And would have loved to be a part of it.
So I should probably go to sleep now...
After I say hi to my wife...
And then when I get home I should probably write some comics.
Tomorrow I gotta ship books to the hotel, see my friend off to Vancouver and also work 9 hours at least.
Emerald city comic con is coming up way too fast...
I've got 8 days to animate 1600+ frames. Gonna be rough.
@Megzilla87 YARP!
Leaving work now... Yay.....
That got a little galaxy quest at the end. Apologies.
Do you like your body? Cool! Own that shit. You do you. Fuck the haters. The answer is love. Keep on truckin'  Never give up never surrender
Woooo blocking out a 500 frame 2 character shot like a boss.
@Shareyaworld ha! That's awesome!

@RobbieandBobby you know whut? I may actually get something in on time.
Ugh... What a frustrating morning.
@cscomics lick it! It could be chocolate!
It never ceases to fail. As soon as I lay down for a nap everybody around me has to loud things.
@tavismaiden hold me one of  the CT ones!
@IvanDashSmith @GameOfThrones no. Can you hold on a bit.
That's also sarcasm.
I have never seen rain. That's why I make that tweet.
Holy shit... It's raining...
@GreyTheTick ugh... Why do people have to ruin sex with hatred. So dumb.
@tavismaiden hey, you going to have any of those ERFBOUND and Chrono trigger prints at ECCC?
So glad I took a chance and picked up "This War of Mine" on steam. So fucking good.
@Megzilla87 don't. Draw new prints.
Now that the comic is up. Let's go work for 10 hours or so...
The process vid of today's comic for patrons will be up later. Rendering it has been a pain.
In this comic, I make a mean "Salad"... 
@Keithito have you done SPX before?
When you blow your nose and a giant booger shoots out with such force you think... "come allergy season I can weaponize this"
Got a bad burn on my pinky finger yesterday and it stings like a mother...
Changed my Twitter profile to better reflect my opinion on how busy I'm going to be the next 2 weeks.
@Fluxfoxphoto double overtime?
@Fluxfoxphoto can you also work overtime for me? Thanks.
@Fluxfoxphoto that's too many levels.
@Fluxfoxphoto I'm glad one of us does
Tune in next episode when I'm divorced due to neglect...
Can I work overtime, prep for 2 conventions with travel and maintain a comic?
@MrBrofield at least it's good exercise!
So I have a comic that'll I'll finish tonight. I just need to find a stronger second panel.
@zombieroomie I was born a pilot.
@TrailCreations something like that.
Someone put on cologne in the washroom and now I prefer the shit smell that was there before.
Ahhh... A seat on the streetcar or as I like to call it "Being at Dick-on-your-shoulder high"
A part of the Internet just stopped today. #GWS
Club Nintendo Mario Gamecube Controller. 
One day I will open my nerd coffee shop called "Java Update"
@Featherweight_ potential business venture.
@DRainford fucking right you take it.
Only 2 client revisions means today is a good day.
@DrunkenNovice nice try. But I kept my day job.
Got one of the those emails that reminds me why I make humour comics. #TheFeels
@ferito22 made it out of lego.
@ferito22 YARP!
Courage! 
Guys I fucking love Chrono Trigger, you have no idea. #ChronoTrigger 
@Tautologicaly well... That certainly opens up more to me...
I call him my boss but really he just sends me money and tells me I need makes ads.
Happy bday to my webcomic boss @Tautologicaly Yep there's bosses in webcomics too!
@paulwestover except less happy
@DrunkenNovice you swedes and your great moods.
@DrunkenNovice is it bad in Sweden too?
Man, is today "Let's wear too much perfume and go on public transit" day? The smells. They hurt.
Yay for spending the morning trying to figure out why the rent payment I gave me landlord never posted.
Chrono Trigger is my favourite game of all time. I own 14 versions of it. Its the only game I've attempted to speed run and low level.
You know how in Chrono Trigger you could get those tech rocks only once per play through... I had 99 of them. It's been a good 20 years.
I know Tron legacy had its problems, but I fucking love the tron universe.
@GreyTheTick part of the yetis charm is the different recording modes. I would use more than just cardioid.
@GreyTheTick hmmm... It only has XLR out though...
@GreyTheTick what do you suggest as an alternative?
@GreyTheTick o....kay. I've seen decent shock mounts for them out there. Audio quality seems great too...
@deathbulge God damnit Dan.
Audio peeps! How is the Blue Yeti? Should I go pro or standard?
I may have that wrong.
Making webcomics is a lot like going to war. Because you invade another country and fire guns at its army and bomb its inhabitants.
In this comic, what happens when the sun comes up? 
@Hiveworks great map. Spelled my comic name wrong. But a great map nonetheless!
@Megzilla87 give me like 10mins just putting dishes away.
@Megzilla87 when do you wanna play?
@Megzilla87 smash bros later. I might be on.
I owe everything to women. In fact, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for a woman. #InternationalWomensDay
Women are pretty freaking awesome folks. #InternationalWomensDay
I miss having friends.
@Megzilla87 COOKIES!!!!!
@christopheeerrr "Like a scene from a Romantic Comedy starring Harrison Ford, Harrison Ford has crashed..."
@JimZub *Sniff* I understand...
@ItsMeJustinBoyd sweet thumb bro
Guys, I'm sorry. I need the night off. some health stuff is getting the better of me.
@GreyTheTick fucking phone!!!!
You know what keeps you grounded? The feeling that your dying right this very moment. Puts shit in perspective.
@GreyTheTick just eat it.
@deathbulge @grrlpowercomic the GBA re-releases are IMO the best versions.
@grrlpowercomic isn't it great to be right?
@Hypest_Braden that is one I have on my "to play" list...
FF4 is one of my favourite RPGs of all time but I might wanna save that for later.
I'm thinking an earthbound piece and an FF6 piece.
@Hypest_Braden already done. 
Okay... I wanna do a new 11x17 print for this con season. I'm thinking of doing a 16bit RPG theme. Any suggestions?
Man... The come down off a panic attack is so draining... I feel like ran a marathon.
I love how the dog in that Geico Commercial is like "Fuck Salad!"
Asking a friend for some art. Friend- "Let me just give it to you" Me- "NO! Let me fucking pay you!"
Big Audiobook sale on iTunes today. S…
People who may go to #ConBravo and work in animation. I'm thinking of hosting an anim pros panel q&amp;a/talk. Let me know if you're interested.
Okay this Geico Ad is pretty good. 
I often write stand up routines. I probably never will do one. But I write it.
It's important to diversify your writing. Don't just write jokes or drama all the time. Switch it up. Play with stuff.
Spending tonight writing. All sorts of stuff. Mainly an outline for a game I'd love to make one day.
@rockpapercynic teach me senpai.
That shot 1:08 in the new Avengers trailer is totally comic booky and I fucking love it.
@paulwestover just lube up and slide over.
@paulwestover I'm only an hour away.
@AmyTFalcone the worst is the hit your immune system takes. That and the dry ache... Such fun.
@paulwestover you would...
@rockpapercynic damnit... I only have canola oil.
Nice to see the Runbow guys doing well. They're some pretty cool peeps!
@danjohncox @cowceda so jelly.
The average detached home in Toronto now costs a million dollars...
Take that as you will...
I have continued to do my job in a way that pleases my superiors and have been granted the privilege to please those superiors further.
Hooray for continued employment!!
@christopheeerrr sounds like you've got "Boarders". If you start stock piling client notes and NDA's I'll be worried.
@christopheeerrr I hope those classes go super well. The animation world needs good board artists.
@christopheeerrr but Chris, who are you kidding?
@Megzilla87 UGH. I know right.
@MissionHillTV I'd eat a whole couch.
@christopheeerrr I don't know if you noticed. But I'm really good at this marketing thing. Lol
@christopheeerrr "Hey, you talentless hack!. You're gonna need us, because look at ya. You're pathetic. BUY NOW!!!"
@christopheeerrr I just love how patronizing that email was...
@christopheeerrr but seriously, who are you kidding? I mean, come on. Do you really expect us to believe? You're not fooling anyone.
@rockpapercynic 8008135
@rockpapercynic 7
Note to self: @Megzilla87 has one of my GC adapters.
I put my hood up and headphones so I won't be disturbed at work. I don't know why my supervisor keeps handing me more work.
@GynoStar I favd because "YOUR NOT MY REAL MOM!!!"
Accidentally pressed both up AND down buttons while calling the elevator. So I panicked and piddled all over the floor...
I'm so niche that everybody likes me.
@ChrisHallbeck just keep buying bigger jeans till the weight of you wearing them is an exercise!
That sore on tongue that rubs against your test and so every waking moment is fucking terrible.
@zombieroomie it's a shirt, flat works better on a shirt.
@zombieroomie flat.
@HugoBedward @damnyouwillis yes but he has a work ethic second to none in webcomics.
It's kinda weird having comics written for the next few weeks.
@zombieroomie if ever a shirt should exist...
@PretzelEmpress *Mind Blown*
@PretzelEmpress what's a triangle?
@PretzelEmpress looks like that bed is wearing a bikini bottom.
When your phone autocorrects "you're" to "your" and makes you look like an idiot.
When you're typing a message and your not sure if you want to send it to them still but you accidentally hit enter and send " I' "
In this comic, we're going to jail 
@Megzilla87 good! It's a great con! #conbravo
@armcannon how do I get one myself?
Encountered Some skull puppets in DnD 
@GreyTheTick *Vomits liquid feces all over everybody but you* Love Ya buddy!
@sciencecomic what do you need?
@LanMikoto Why would I play bad games?
@davoerlo I'm still thankful.
I love you, you infinitely patient audience you.
I'm going to post these next week. This week has been a write off.
Alrighty, now that I have some time I'm going to sketch out some comics.
I'm gonna do an #FF for my friend @Megzilla87 who's a pretty good drawer person. Follow her.
@UpdateMandatory @ElyseWillems @IanHinck @BenMoore035 traded them for Hearthstone Legendaries.
@LanMikoto gotta the Zephram Cochran handshake instead.
I can't do the Vulcan hand salute so I'm sad. I feel like less of a geek.
But what does the dress have to say about Spocks death???
No! Master Xehanort!! #RIPLeonardNimoy
@GreyTheTick @Mazzle5 I think you're ignoring a giant part of the game, grey.
@GreyTheTick Nope.
@GreyTheTick I also hate myself.
@GreyTheTick naw. I've been hatin on sports for years.
@blambot that's a buy.
I have to say it's kinda cool how it looked one way to me and now it's completely different. Our brains are really cool. #TheDress
Today we all got a great lesson in color theory.
Cant wait for the dress episode of SVU in six months time.
Is there a TeeSpring with the two llamas one dress??? I need to commemorate Thursday.
Tweet about how I'm "Too Cool" to have some fun about a viral picture of a dress.
I think we can all agree that's a shitty picture.
I miss the times that dress looked White and gold.
Clearly we we're not capable of handling Net neutrality.
@Mega_Ashra still see white and gold... it's just darker...
I just printed a solid black page and now it's gold. My printer prints gold. I'm rich now. Bye.
Oh man, You guys remember that time with the dress that was like different colours to different people... Fun times...
@Fluxfoxphoto HA! no... *tosses ideas in to full trash can labelled "The Dress Comic Ideas"*
Looking forward to all the #TheDress webcomics tomorrow. Don't disappoint internet!
So Lynn sees the dress as black and Blue and I see it as white and gold.
Holy hell, calm the fuck down Internet. They're just Llamas, it's just a dress.
@Joe_Hunter no you idiot it's J'eh Zed.
@TheOnlyTrout Yeah arrived today!
@TheOnlyTrout Yes! Thank you for grabbing that Meta Knight and Lucario for me.
Amiibo Collection Complete! For now... 
@Megzilla87 We just need to thrust you into a crowd of people.
Woo! Net neutrality!
That BattleChasers game announcement has made this terrible line at the post office bearable.
Yes! A BattleChasers GAME! 
I love their stuffed crust! 
"Once" was pretty good. Great tunes. Loved the fact that the actors were also the musicians.
@davoerlo it's okay... We all slip up once. what is important is that you recognized it. *Motions to the Snipers*
They've got a bar on stage you can order drinks from at the musical "Once" 
At the musical "once" and drinkin Guinness. Seemed appropriate.
@IvanDashSmith no. Just thank you.
@toonholechris good ol' agricultural side hugs for me.
@IvanDashSmith thank you.
@artsytarts so glad it finally got to you! I was worried some of these packages would never make it!!
Beef Stroganoff: Both delicious and fun to do!
God, I love Better Call Saul. Bob @mrbobodenkirk is so good.
Worked till 9 tonight. Got great reviews on my acting in my scenes. Then animated 6 seconds in 2 hours. Pretty good long day.
I miss @the_moviebob 's The Big Picture...
That was an excerpt from my one man play "a 9 year old in the playground"
I hate that game you like.
#PerfectAlbums White Pony - Deftones, Fez soundtrack - @Disasterpeace , Turn the radio off - Reel Big Fish, In Utero - Nirvana
@IvanDashSmith 
Alright let's try to sleep again.
@samandfuzzy I believe you are correct. I'm a big fan of his pirate act.
@samandfuzzy did... Did I just get Pam'd?
@samandfuzzy the battleship game in Wind Waker was fun...
I was so tired today that I was looking forward to going to bed early. Went to bed early and now I can't fall asleep...
Which is something I wish I had more time to do. I do read all the comments.
I don't even make a lot at conventions I just really like talking to my readers.
I wish I had more time to dedicate to specific parts of being a webcomicker. making the comic and conventions are all I can do.
I had one in the works last year but freelancing to survive kinda killed its momentum
All these as problems lately have made take a hard look at the site. And I think it's time for a remodel.
@mtughan Ugh... yeah.
#PerfectAlbums Genesis - Invisible Touch, Save Ferris - It means everything, GlassJaw - Worship and Tribute, @anamanaguchi - Endless Fantasy
somebody left a comment about the College thing in today's comic. In Canada Colleges are actually pretty good. so suck it.
@TheOnlyTrout a guy can dream.
I like that tweet but I don't know if it's my favourite...
@TheOnlyTrout lol. Never prevented Lucas or the fire emblem gang...
An entire line of Amiibos based on the Startropics games. #MakeItHappen
@Shaggyshan and dark pit and JigglyPuff and mii fighters and...
@Shaggyshan Duck Hunt, Rob, and Mr. Game and watch then I'm done. Also Falco. And Dr. Mario and Bowser jr. And Zero Suit Samus and ganondorf
In this comic, we save for the future! 
New comic is up, I'll do the social media thing in the morn. Patrons will also get a new Time Lapse video.
@Megzilla87 
okay that Birdman/Whiplash joke was pretty good.
YEAH FUCK THE PLAY OFF MUSIC! #OSCARS
@cscomics Such an original opinion.
Recorded a time lapse cid of me drawing tomorrow's comic for patrons. It's rendering now.
Writing comics. Actually I lied, I'm writing this tweet THEN writing comics.
@TweetBravo got everyone that is currently released.
@ChrisHallbeck don't forget about all the times you did succeed and somebody else may jealous and damn I feel bad about that may they  deser
That "Forest at Golden Hour" Colour scheme. Love it.
Alright, #WindWaker does have a really great looking version of Hyrule Castle. Let's get that colour treatment for an entire zelda game.
@DRainford that's a lot of N64s
Made it to the island...
Me letting wind waker play itself... 
I'll let you guys know when I get to the island...
I have literally let this game autopilot. #WindWaker
The Legend of Checking my phone while I sail to the next island. #WindWaker
3D Zelda games are the worst...
For some reason my body won't let me sleep all day... Stupid body.
@iamtylerscott are you real?
@PureLionHeart no. Thank you!
Pyjamas without pockets are the worst. Where am I supposed to keep my late night sweet potato fries?
Good night.
I'm just going to sleep all day today...
@GreyTheTick I like the one I did.
When a game gives you the tip "JOLT the enemies" you assume an electric attack not "Roll into the tree like a fucking idiot" #WindWaker
I just want to post this every time it happens. 
Should I make this an obvious joke or use a more subtle approach. *goes subtle* first comment is somebody stating the obvious punchline.
@jinxville @TheOnlyTrout that's my name! Do t wear it out!
@TheOnlyTrout @jinxville YES!!! I'm so glad it went through!!!
Here's a tip: Plan ahead. The last thing you'll ever want to have happen to you, is to start something and find out that you don't have enou
2 hour production meeting with the director. The entire time I'm thinking "I shoulda pooped before hand" #awkwardsits #awkwardshits
Running more errands before work. I'm getting fat off all these work appetizers...
@CrazyJkun try it on your pubes and butt hair. Trust me.
I've said this before. Superman v Batman is either going to be great or a Trainwreck. I'm down for both.
That is a great use of Jason Momoa. That AquaMan makes me wet.
Totally on board with that AquaMan.
In this comic, we experience the unknown. 
My goal for 2015 is to finally have my student loan paid off.
@paulwestover @zombieroomie I do... I really do...
@toonholechris damnit... I suck at that game too!
@zombieroomie @paulwestover @Skawtnyc excellent.
@zombieroomie @paulwestover as long as Paul doesn't come over...
@zombieroomie yeah, you and @paulwestover are away from me, which is good because Paul sucks balls.
@Calgaryexpo Nope all good! Same spot as last year. I just hope the map is right this year.
@zombieroomie naw. We one row closer to the entrance this time.
I hope I never make enemies with any webcomicker. I've DM'd my home address to way too many of them...
If you have trouble finding me in Calgary just look for every other webcomic and I'll be right next to them.
Regardless I'm excited for Calgary. It's a great show with awesome people.
Looks like I have the same spot as last year at @Calgaryexpo U-01 or it could be M-01 like the labelled it last year. Lol.
@Calgaryexpo are the AA placements on the web the ones for 2015?
@paulwestover man... I am an asshole for a Canadian.
@paulwestover I don't know what Sandi sees in you...
@paulwestover FUCK YOU PAUL! IT IS WINNING! YOU'RE THE LOSER IN THIS EXCHANGE!
I WON A FREE COFFEE FINALLY!!! AFTER 43 CUPS I FINALLY ROLLED UP A WINNER!!! #timhortons
0 for 42 on Roll up the Rim to Win. #timhortons
@TheOnlyTrout I actually have yet to sell any of my doubles...
@TheOnlyTrout Welcome friend.
Sketched and inked a comic but forgot to record it for the time lapse video. Doh. I'll do something up on Friday to make up for it Patrons.
Yes! I love when shots get approved! Bring on new shots!!!
@christopheeerrr I think anyone that is working in an animation pipeline should animate at least one shot... just to understand that side
@christopheeerrr if your goal is TV at first. Don't load the comp with characters all the time. Animators will hate you. I will hate you.
@christopheeerrr yeah man you do your thing. Your look is what is gonna define your boards.
@christopheeerrr oh man... You'd be surprised what passes for "boards" some days. Please think of the animators when you board...
@Graph_Editor I'll use you when I you're necessary.
I wouldn't be concerned about it but they also tend to lose packages...
I really wish CanadaPost would provide tracking numbers for a reasonable price. Paying the $60 level just get a tracking # is dumb.
@Jimininstrovich my wife is the pun master. I'm just a humble pundawan
@mistersenorsir I don't get that either...
So many people I follow on Twitter are into wrestling and I just don't get it.
Running errands before work this morning. Because I need a work appetizer before my work entree. I may even stay late for work dessert.
@d20monkey dear god man! Charge your phone!
I love the Wifi networks around my apartment. 
I'm dumb now.
No wait. My dad was right. I've got shit for brains...
There is far too much poop exiting this body compared to the amount of food that went in. I suspect I'm sleep eating.
@cscomics is that a famous person? Is that his catch phrase? I stopped watching A&amp;E
@cscomics ah... That's a whole other thing... That's just a bunch a dicks.
@cscomics don't you're in school. Most of us miss that. LET US LIVE THROUGH YOU!!!
@cscomics in terms of your dilemma. Remember they're all just really passionate about their loves and in a room with very little judgement
@cscomics U MAD BRO?
@TheOnlyTrout the blue crew dropped in! 
@Year_200 @DrunkenNovice the only reason we saw it was because Lynn's work did some of the 3D conversion on it.
So now @canadapostcorp doesn't even bother checking to see if somebody is home when delivering a package. They just leave the card and go.
In this comic, the first rule of Knitters Meet Up is always check your gauge. 
Just saw Jupiter ascending and yikes... At least the ships were pretty.
@Shaggyshan what all entails in those? I've considering trying it.
NO!
*smacks it out of her hand*
"I want to color!"
ITS NOT WHAT YOU THINK
"But daddy-"…
@LanMikoto Rayman was a more believable one... He has a trophy in game and rayman was exclusive to WiiU for a bit there.
@LanMikoto people are passionate about smash bros. Can't blame em.
@LanMikoto the DLC.
Bravo to the guy that put the time in for that Rayman fake.
Rayman DLC for smash possibly? I'd give an arm and a leg for that to be true!
For all you single people out there... 
Because today is a very special day... 
In this comic, we might go to a movie? 
So new comic was posted a couple of hours ago. I'll do the social media thing when I wake up. Night all!
@JimZub It's funny that we live around the corner from each other but only see one another 3000km away from home.
@Megzilla87 Nice I hadn't heard that one before.
@Megzilla87 Did they do their cover of Heart Shaped Box?
Flights for ECCC booked. Flying out of T.O. this time...
@IanHinck @GameTrailersVO is it The Last of Us?
@Featherweight_ hopefully they can ride that wave to the bank.
@paulwestover aw, I love you too.
@rockpapercynic yeah she's alright that one.
@paulwestover wow. Go fuck yourself.
Leaving work now... Will finish a comic when I get home.
@Featherweight_ well it's their site to do with as they please. I guess I'll just have to go where Bob goes...
@TheOnlyTrout pretty much. Just more princess peach and Marth are involved...
Looking forward to the inevitable patreon from @the_moviebob so I can directly support an online content creator.
@VanityGames yeah, @the_moviebob was the only reason I went there...
So is there any reason to go to The Escapist anymore?
We took a giant production staff picture today. I look forward to dreading it.
Welcome to Toronto, or as the locals call it Condotopia.
And I'll use what I've already drawn as s buffer comic.
I think I'll turn some tweets into comics... That always works out well.
I suggested to the wife that we go see 50 shades of grey and she slapped me in the face. Then it became a really good night.
@LanMikoto mines on the way!
I'm waiting with glee for all the inevitable "50 shades Valentine's Day accident" articles coming soon... #Schadenfreude
I just pre-ordered a copy of @KtShy and @Shaggyshan 's wonderful Silly Kingdom 2 Have you? 
Today's a PJ's underneath my jeans cold kinda day.
@cscomics 
@Megzilla87 that's the spirit! See Ya at work tomorrow!
@BlasterNation it was nice while it lasted.
@Megzilla87 do you want to get gud at drawing or sleep like a loser?
@Megzilla87 terrible. Do it again.
@TheOnlyTrout Sheik popped in! 
alright, new comic inked. heading to bed now I'll finish it off tomorrow and upload it.
.@SoundCloud why no volume control on your embeded player?
@bubblegumnex "ooo what is this? Oh... Never mind... It's just a giant piece of shit..."
@GordonDarkfoot you're a good man, Gordon Darkfoot.
@bubblegumnex I already have honey mustard and sriracha at home.
@JimZub that looks like it's going to be painful later on...
I'm ordering chicken wings for dinner because I hate myself and I want to die covered in a mixture of BBQ and Dill sauces.
0 for 21 on Roll up the Rim to Win... #TimHortons
I love how cute that president is.
Alright... I'll give em that. Obama saying "Thanks Obama" is pretty funny.
@andie_dandy @TorontoDandies @rockpapercynic I guess it depends on the bra.
@TorontoDandies @rockpapercynic true comfort would have been no bra... Haven't you ever been a woman before Peter???
Blood Faucet is the name of my Jethro Tull cover band.
Shout outs to Dry Air for making my nose a blood faucet!
Thankfully we have a 3 day weekend coming up. #ThankStFamily
This week is a write off...
Got home from work, slept for like 3 hours. Woke up just now. Going to eat dinner... Then probably sleep again...
@zombieroomie ha that's awesome. I'm might have treat myself to it if I do well at ECCC.
So tired. I got that dry toast feeling... Send sleep.
@TheOnlyTrout I chose the wrong country to get born into. I guess I'll just have to settle for safe and cold.
@TheOnlyTrout looks so warm!
0/17 on Roll up the Rim to win. That's not including the bonus roll ups. Which is also 0/17. #timhortons
@rockpapercynic unacceptable. How dare you have a life.
@zombieroomie I'm M-10, ryan's M-12, Paul is M-13
@ItsMeJustinBoyd PLEASE DM YOUR TABLE NUMBER FOR ECCC I WANT TO BE EVEN MORE HAPPY!
I AM SO PUMPED UP RIGHT NOW!
@TheOnlyTrout d'awww I was gonna ask... that sucks.
ECCC TABLE PLACEMENTS CAME IN!!! BUDDIES, WHERE ARE YOU!!??!?!?!
Samantha B for #TheDailyShow
@TheOnlyTrout yeah, I'm hoping Meta Knight comes through for us.
@TheOnlyTrout I grabbed him on the way home from work tonight. Race you to sheik and toon link!
I'm really feelin' it! 
Which is great because it means my acting was good.
Apparently most of the notes for my shots are just staging notes. "Make this char bigger" "push char left more"
Also this letter is like the last in a series of apparent letters. PAST DUE pasted all over it.
I guess I'm gonna have to make a phone call...
Sure. Let's just make shit up. FedEx you owe me $15 for stuff and things, also items.
Relieved a letter from @FedEx saying I owe them $15. No reason given, haven't received a package from fedex. But I must pay immediately.
Spiderman now back with marvel films? Cool. Let's make it Miles Morales and @donaldglover for Spiderman.
@zombieroomie @DenisJCaron sweet I'm staying with a lady I have a crush on too!
@DenisJCaron @zombieroomie I'll bring the dick fingers.
@DenisJCaron you just really miss Seattle it seems.
@zombieroomie @DenisJCaron sounds like party time.
@DenisJCaron are staying till Monday? Lynn and I wanna actually see some of Seattle the Sunday.
@DenisJCaron yeah, I'm a fan of the hotel. Independence is great.
@DenisJCaron Yeah we're at the Sheraton again.
@DenisJCaron Nice! what hotel?
Once everything is set up. Literally the easiest thing is animating it...
Finally seeing progress happen in this shot.
I'm basically character rigging at this point. I'm not an animator anymore. Least for this shot...
@cscomics well you'll be better prepared than I was out of school. Granted there was more 3D work back then.
@cscomics ask him to teach ya. Honestly haven't both ToonBoom and Maya makes you a more desirable hire.
Groupon sent me an email about Nickleback tickets. So I deleted my Gmail account just to be safe.
Ultimately it's better. But it's like you're building a custom rig for every shot.
That's the crap part about ToonBoom. The setup time in each shot is redonk.
Spent all morning contorting a rigs legs to make one pose... ALL MORNING.
Yay! Insomnia.
In this comic, some plans don't work out as intended... 
@TreeVor7 
Loving this panel coming from Thursday's comic... 
Monday's comic is done. Thursday's is written and roughed.
These TMNT PJ's my mom got me for xmas have no pockets so I disowned her...
I told my wife that the chicken wing place we love now does delivery and now I'm the bad guy.
@Lunarbaboon Nope. Far from family circus. You've got jokes in your comic.
@TheOnlyTrout At that moment, I show her this picture of half her yarn collection. 
@TheOnlyTrout Literally just got it. like 20 mins ago... I totally forgot I pre-ordered it when there was the whole Toys R us scare.
@TheOnlyTrout like this one? 
Aw yeah... Super Mario Elsa! 
@TheOnlyTrout in my heart I was hoping a shiny lucario would appear.
@TheOnlyTrout awwww yisss. Just got my Shulk shipping notice too. Everything's coming up ARG today.
There's great "Terrible" characters and then there's just terrible characters.
It's just kinda cruel... I can see Ricket get completely destroyed but the way they treat Dee sometimes just bugs me.
That joke is getting really old. It's just kinda mean and not in a "it's always sunny" way where you tolerate it because the chats are awful
Despite all the calling Dee a bitch.
That latest it's always sunny episode was probably my most favourite yet.
My goal this weekend is to have comics for people to put their eyeballs on.
@Megzilla87 Imaginary friend it up!
Another Spidah Mahns. 
Sometimes I like to draw noodly arm Spider-Man. 
Now casting Actor to play Link for Live action Zelda series. Must be good at screaming "HA!" "HUAAAH!" and "SKAAAAANKKK!!!" #liveactionzelda
@ItsMeJustinBoyd 
Crazy how similar my dad and Jeff Bridges are. Jeff Bridges is so chill and my dad got sucked into a digital world never to be seen again

Everyone send @DrunkenNovice birthday wishes. He'd hate that sort of thing.
Just in case one breaks... 
Made a lego Gomez from Fez for my desk at work. 
@DRainford it's called borington for a reason.
@DRainford nobody likes Burlington in the snow... It's purgatory.

@TweetBravo SNES
UGH. I hate how that new Magic Mike XXL trailer gives women the unrealistic expectation that all men can dance that well.
We hit the first Patreon milestone! that means more time lapse process vids like this! 
@mtughan someone just pledged $100
Dedicating a chunk of time tonight to writing jokes. Hopefully I can sketch one up for s comic.
Clear Gamecube controller! 
@GordonDarkfoot I can take it.
That moment when you're looking at storyboards for your shot and you're thinking... That looks like a @KtShy drawing...
Seriously, it's been 2 1/2 years since I got a piece of hate mail. I must be doing something right.
Thanks for all the kind words about the comic schedule change. I always prepare for backlash so I can be pleasantly surprised with support.
@TheBrainOfSean thanks man, I appreciate all of you guys' support!
@eyesofviolet13 hmmm... Now if I only had time...
@CarversKnife no bugging felt.
@eyesofviolet13 do I need to play them all to get the story?
@CarversKnife I've taken to importing them.
@CarversKnife in a sense, yes.
I never got into Persona. But the menus in that trailer look like fun on its own.
If you restart in real life to you become a wee baby again? I could use a do over... I've registry errors and driver issues aplenty.

@egoraptor 
@TheOnlyTrout @LanMikoto PINK GOLD NESS
@TheOnlyTrout yeah. Im anxious about our meta knight orders.
@Megzilla87 kingplayer.de Germany has tons of amiibos.
@LanMikoto @TheOnlyTrout as soon as isaw those I almost gave up.
@TheOnlyTrout are you missing any 1st or 2nd wave?
@TheOnlyTrout man... This is a dangerous addiction we've gotten ourselves into...
@TheOnlyTrout sad part is the PAL one has a better paint job.
@LanMikoto order one from kingplayer.de that's where I got the second one.
@TheOnlyTrout I bought the other one to open and now I'm debating opening it.
I'm such a fucking nerd... 
well... that didn't take long. I've already seen rule 34 of Left Shark...
Also it's really hard to find a picture of Tiffany Amber Thiessen where she's not basically wearing a only a bra...
#4childhoodcrushes I was so sweet on Jodie Sweetin when I was a kid. 
@cscomics this ruins the amazing aesthetic lego has. Why not just build it out of Knex? #anticurvedlego
@danjohncox @CAPYGAMES no guys... We all win. Games get better with talented people working behind them.
My wife left boots at the fridge for some reason... 
@squeakyevil I'm sure it'll be soon.
Shit... There's gold and silver amiibos now...
Alright it's 2:30am I'll have to get the Cintiq working tomorrow...
Thankfully this isn't a work drive. All this drive has is some old files from way back.
So I've gotten to a point where I can see what's on this drive (albeit very slowly) but I can't copy it over. I might have to take the loss.
@rockpapercynic I also use whiskey as a lube when I masturbate.
Okay... I've got the computer to detect the drive again... Now to grab what I can off it before it dies.
And now it's not recognizing my Cintiq...
Ugh... It's looking like I might have lost this drive entirely...
Well, looks like I'm spending tonight fixing my computer... No comic tomorrow. I'll post one Thursday.
@rockpapercynic "that fucking turtle again... God damn it turtles killed my family" - emotionally distressed mail person
One of the hard drives is crapping out on my computer... Spending tonight doing backups and a fresh install of a new drive.

@BenMoore035 there's a lot of euro companies that have tons. Japan is more expensive. But amiibos aren't region locked so yay!
@BenMoore035 imports dude. Hit the import scene.

@starkdesign I have Ike and bowser. With the rest on their way or preordered....

@rockpapercynic what about individual days? Did you have a spike day? What was the bounce rate then?
@ArmadaUGS sad to see her go but I understand the choice. This meta is so quick now.
@rockpapercynic yikes. That's rough.
@EG_PPMD when your human makes a really weird sound at you. 
@TheOnlyTrout yes!!!! Any word on meta knight?
But hey! That's being #leftshark !!!

A wild slime appears. 
@HLReiku Photoshop open there. I ink in Manga studio. everything else in Photoshop
Today's setup. Comics and smash. #apex2015 
Just banged my knee really badly walking to the washroom. I am all sorts of broken.

The bad ting about sleeping all day to get better is now you're up all night because you slept all day.
My throat and back are so incredibly sore. I tried to draw for a bit and Nope.. Then I tried to play vidya gaems... Nope. I am le sad...
@JimZub WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
To see what has happened in the last like 10 hours at #Apex2015 is crazy. Way to go guys. Let's hope it all runs smoothly tomorrow.
@Megzilla87 don't die.
@JimZub how about writing yourself a vacation.
it's great to see @Twitch jumping in to help save a smash event. #Apex2015
and #Apex2015 is still alive!

Big thanks @Twitch for this.

Tell everyone …
つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE APEX STAFF YOUR ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ #Apex2015
In retrospect, whoever jokingly pulled that fire alarm may have saved lives today... #Apex2015
sad to see #apex2015 on hold but man... if that hotel collapsed with all those people in it? that would be sadder.
@TheOnlyTrout 
@TheOnlyTrout just following the #apex2015 hash feed
@TheOnlyTrout Now imagine them moving all those AGAIN just so the show can go on.
@TheOnlyTrout It's the new apex logo...
Feel bad for the TO's at #Apex2015 ... this is nuts.
@TheOnlyTrout in a perfect world all amiibos would be available in Peach.
That fire alarm combo is killing #Apex2015
whenever they decide to not be on fire anymore. #Apex2015
The only upside to being sick today is I get to watch #Apex2015 pools.
Let this be a lesson. Get plenty of sleep and take time to relax. Don't burn the candle at every conceivable end.
So sick right now...
Maybe I should eat some dinner at some point today...
Pro tip: don't work freelance and make a webcomic and have a wife and start a new job that requires a lot of training all in the same month.
Writing comics. They probably won't get drawn till after work tomorrow. But comic stuff is getting worked on.
Canada post: Where 6 packages returned to sender is considered a good day.
Some quick work sketches. 
@Bartenerds well it's just t-shirts and baseball caps. Not cosplay.
@Waffleman26 with RPG elements.
@TheOnlyTrout just this one. 
@TheOnlyTrout MORE AMIIBO! Specifically aimed to make Andrew bankrupt!!!
IDEA: A Nintendo RPG like kingdom hearts and super Mario RPG staring every Nintendo Property. Super RPG Bros.
@TheOnlyTrout an updated nintendo land would be cool. Or a new Super Mario RPG with all nintendo characters.
@TheOnlyTrout lol. I wish they did more.
@TheOnlyTrout I selectively train the others.
@TheOnlyTrout lol yeah. I'm doing that whole keep one in a box for display thing. It's like the only collectible I've done it with
@TheOnlyTrout yeah, I put my faith in a German site. Germany seems to get a ton of them. They're already shipping me another Marth.
@TheOnlyTrout yeah in the end it's about the same. I'm just hoping all my preorders stay preordered.
@TheOnlyTrout I ended up ordering a Japanese one. It's already on its way.
@TheOnlyTrout gonna be so good!
@TheOnlyTrout yeah it's a shame it'll be trumped by the top 8 matches. Hopefully they have reruns.
@Bartenerds the employees wear street fighter themed shirts and hats. Wasn't about to go take random pics of people
This Vietnamese sandwich shop I'm getting lunch from is Street Fighter themed.
@LuckyTrinh ha thanks. I'm currently in that overlap of work and freelance.
@rockpapercynic comic it.
Ah... That dry pain of insomnia.... Such fun.
Lego Rainbow... 
@GynoStar one day men will have their time in the spotlight, you'll see.
@GynoStar it's true! every where I turn there's all these women taking great acting parts that could go to under talented men.
@ObscureGent oh, for sure. They're demons, not assholes.
@ObscureGent @ObscureTrevor I have bad news for you.
In this comic, a coffee break. 
@TrailCreations Google it.
All female ghostbusters? Awesome.
@tavismaiden I find pacing back and forth while having a panic attack is great way to question whether or not I should keep writing.
@guigar reflection of a good instructor. That or youve put the fear of failure in them.
Though I did enjoy chronicle very much.
I'm on the fence about that Fantastic 4 trailer. But I think I'm just being safe because of the last two.
Ugh... Can't sleep... Tomorrow is going to be rough...
@rockpapercynic talking on the phone must be awkward...
@rockpapercynic Don't fall into that trap.
@Croquevielle well I can't fault you for good taste. Welcome aboard.
@Croquevielle oh god, why would you do that to yourself?
First day of work is going well. They gave me my own sequence all for myself.
In this comic, we start a new job! 
@turtlemma  thanks for sticking around!
I'm cool with people sharing the comic as long as they keep the credits and post a link back to the site.
ARG's Front paging Imgur again. Which is awesome. Thank you to the poster for properly linking back to the site.
@cscomics quality takes time.
Today is Make Comics day. I want a weeks worth of comics done today.
@rockpapercynic ha! nice! Goodguy poster.
Apparently that burrito place has new owners. It's sad to see a once great place go...
And then wanting us to return the burrito to the store? Really?  We ordered delivery for a reason. Jeez.
Well, thanks for taking hour and half, messing up our order and then blaming us for the mix up. You used to be great @bastardburrito
@rockpapercynic I've seen far worse.
Writing comics now. At some point tonight I'll draw one and post it. Apologies for the delay.
@GreyTheTick @GynoStar yeah... I've only ever completed the top down Zeldas. The 3D ones just seemed to drag for me.
@GreyTheTick @GynoStar the camera was always the worst.
@TheBrainOfSean we used to play after school all the time. Many a friendship was tested on that version...
@GynoStar never liked OoT. Never been a fan of 3D Zeldas.
You'll also notice that Chrono Trigger appears twice. That game pretty much is a constant in my life. If the tag was #OneGame CT would be it
#FourGames The College years. I almost failed animation because #SSBM 
#FourGames that shaped my last years of high school. 
#FourGames that shaped my high school years. 
#FourGames that shaped my Tweens... 
#FourGames that shaped my very early years. 
@JimZub you've unleaded a nostalgia beast. We're all doomed to look at the past!
@JackCayless find a copy of the animators survival guide. It'll give you some great info on cycles and principles.
@JackCayless you need some up and down and some shoulder movements on her walk.
@TheOnlyTrout I'm ordering keeping an eye out and jumping on any I can. I already pre-ordered wave 4 from Kingsplayer
@TheOnlyTrout yeah I had another order from another place cancel on me. Just thought I'd check.
@TheOnlyTrout sweet. just double checking.
@TheOnlyTrout hey our amiibo pre-orders are still good right?
Woo! I'm finally eating breakfast! It's 5pm. I woke up at 7am...
@MichaelPHuber nope. I'd rather die than choose.
So yeah thanks for your patience folks! Much appreciated!
Brain's a bit frazzled but everything's gonna be good when a steady paycheck comes in and I don't have to worry about the next freelance gig
Then this new animation gig lands in my lap and requires me to learn a whole new animation software.
But recently it's been really tight financially in ARG land. I've been taking on extra commissions and freelance to stay afloat.
I don't usually talk about my life other than the funny things I put in the comic.
I feel bad for letting the comic schedule slip the last few weeks.
@Bartenerds thanks man, appreciate it.
@BurtDurand seriously Peach kicked ass in that mario comic and it was awesome.
@BurtDurand or I'm Canadian Burt.
Animation director is loving my stuff. Feels good to be alive today.
@BurtDurand I literally have the same comics as my #fourcomics
So far, I'm Acing this  ToonBoom training. Which is good because I officially start work on the show on Monday.
@RobbieandBobby did you fight your mirror self on mt. ordeals?
@TheOnlyTrout  there's my Amiibo collection right now. Yes they're still in the package. I like the packaging. 
@TheOnlyTrout nice! found a fox yet?
@TheOnlyTrout 
So much sugar you'll have a shaq attaq! 


new comic will be up probably on friday.
Spending tonight writing and relaxing. This week has been hell and it's only tuesday...
@cscomics ooo sucht 'tude
@cscomics it's just kinda awkward. And I don't get why it's up for any awards. It's like meh. Not terrible just meh.
@Megzilla87 that's cool! I'm still learning to communicate with people here!
@DrunkenNovice legally I can't.
@cscomics your original design would be a pain in the ass to animate if it were the 80's. But yeah cow and chicken is solid.
Animated my first full scene in TB harmony today. Fun! Still not confident with the network window but it's a challenge!
@cscomics Rocko's and cow and chicken are my favourite two. I was looking forward to King of the hill tho.
@MercWorks @cscomics I definitely borrow kermits noodly arm animation for my own.
@cscomics @MercWorks for sure. I was going to say, I dont think there's a bad muppet movie.
@cscomics @MercWorks some of the muppet show is awkward but you can never deny its charm.
@cscomics @MercWorks there is literally a scene where the cast is muppets. These are literal things that happen! Literally!!!!
@MercWorks that is literally the elevator pitch for the show.
@FunderbunkPlays I still recommend Maya. It's not a huge leap from max. But yeah, you're better off than most.
@lartist no prob! Animation is a lot of work but damn is it fun!
@FunderbunkPlays nope.
@bubblegumnex @lartist Animators survival guide, acting for animators. Those two books are a great start.
Toronto based animators, learn yourself ToonBoom and Maya. Be versatile. Be adaptable. Be hireable.
Hey baby let me fiddle your modules. A hurr hurr hurr...
More ToonBoom training today. Hopefully we get into that network window and fiddle around with modules.
@DrunkenNovice Gotta get ur neuroses in check! they're fucking up!
@UnaccountedFour it's okay. just don't let it happen again...
Fixed the grammar error in today's comic. Wife and I just started new jobs so we're exhausted and our error checking skills are on Cooldown
@UnaccountedFour UGH... but you missed the grammar error in the ACTUAL comic. WAY TO GO!
@TrailblazerLuke it's the duck from duck hunt. and... you did that speedart thing of arg right?
In this comic, before we sign the contracts... 
Can't sleep. ToonBoom will get me if I sleep. Musn't fall victim to its network window...
@canada150th or, you know, hire a proper designer and not try and solicit free art from people.
Grats to @LiquidHbox for the win at #Paragon2015 that was some great rests.
@TheOnlyTrout That's the right attitude!
@TheOnlyTrout there's no tier lists when you're a good player.
@TheOnlyTrout because we too can be that good if we put the time in the lab.
#Paragon2015 is triggering all my anxiety. This Tourney is too hype.
@TheOnlyTrout When you die in smash bros you die in real life.
OH MAN @ArmadaUGS with the 4-stock! #Paragon2015
That @LiquidHbox - @ArmadaUGS match was intense. Great play all around. #Paragon2015
@EpicSpaceMoogle yeah, at the most. Tho @xD1x and @TKbreezy are making the coaching sessions bearable.
Ugh... the coaching at #Paragon2015 is killing the flow of this tournament...
@RobbieandBobby Oh yeah!
And by too much I mean not nearly enough.
I have ate entirely too much chicken and too much ribs this weekend.
My colour theory teacher in college said I would never succeed. So I said fuck him and made a black and white webcomic.
Got drunk at medieval times. Now I'm gonna sort through my 2x2 lego collection. Because if I worked on freelance or commissions it'd be bad.
@LoadingArtist toronto
Woot!! Our knight won! GREEN! GREEN! GREEN!!!
I fucking love medieval times. It's so corny.
Medieval times'n it up! 
So glad the dark ages got WiFi. 
@cscomics feel it's hot licks against your balls.
@cscomics to draw fire you must become fire.
@ItsMeJustinBoyd I can't wait for Nap 3: the Sleep-in-ing!
Also it feels good to have a job soon.
Turned down some freelance today. Feels good to say no.
@cscomics no prob. I remember those assignments.
@cscomics peanuts, bobs burgers, simpsons, zim, sponge bob, Disney, family guy, king of the hill...
@DrunkenNovice @Doylecomic so much free time when you get it right the first time.
@DrunkenNovice @Doylecomic you must be very bored today rickard.
Animating on 2's doesn't make animation easier it makes those drawings/frames even more important.
In this comic, how to draw. 
I think I caught whatever's been floating around the studio. Going to lie down for a bit then update the comic.
Listening to people who don't animate talk about how to properly animate something is infuriating...
@Megzilla87 dump away!
@TheOnlyTrout you mean there aren't 1000 year old teenagers????
@Rekeiji that makes him infinitely more attractive.
@Jimininstrovich there's truth in it. It's just this particular scene was just creepy but not in an "arty" way
@Jimininstrovich yeah... I guess... Awkward executed for an awkward scene ironically.
Maybe I just don't get "Gun" culture...
Plus that scene where pulls a gun on his wife and tries to turn her on was super creepy...
Saw American sniper and Bradley cooper was kinda bad in it. The war sequences were alright but everything stateside was awkward.
How the hell did the Lego Movie not even get a Nomination?
@Jampolinski hold on let me write this down. Crap! What was number 2 again?
Going to try mapping a jump to a shoulder button. See how that works out for aerials.
Freelance done for the night. So tired but must play some smash.
I'm stuck at this point of I know what I want to do, but I have no idea how to tell this program to do it.
ToonBoom tools training fell through so I'm just putzing about in another scene till tomorrow.
@ZackRI @BlasterNation @ArcadeLegacyOH lol. I'll take beating. I need more practice.
@BlasterNation @ArcadeLegacyOH ah. I thought it was a hiveworks thinger.
@BlasterNation tournament?
Chrome the ness
Chrom the lucina
@emperorwebrunnr @TheOnlyTrout hey now!
@TheOnlyTrout I'm sure it'll go over like gangbusters on the Amiibo subreddit.
@TheOnlyTrout Chrome the ness and make him your hood ornament. Onward to adventure!
@TheOnlyTrout I'm grabbing 2 of each ness and Lucina. I want one for my new desk at work.
@TheOnlyTrout dat Lucina Amiibo tho.
@TheOnlyTrout @dantheshive also me.
@TheOnlyTrout they did mention in the direct that more Marths are on the way.
@TheOnlyTrout I'm sure restocks are on the way.
No Ac adapter? really? #New3DS
Oh god not MORE amiibos
Again no johns. Got out played. There's some really good players on tonight.
Wrecked again in smash. Actually it was kind of humiliating. But oh well... You learn.
@TheOnlyTrout added
@TheOnlyTrout what's your wii friend thinger?
Alrighty folks going to push Wednesday's comic to Friday as this week is just messed for me. Apologies.
@cscomics I have a plugin for maya that allows me to shout out translation info. it doesn't work.
I know I'll be happy when I get that first paycheque and I can stop stressing about living expenses and the next freelance gig.
@cscomics it's okay it's just I know what I want to do, I just need to know how in the program I can do it.
I say enthusiasm, I really mean energy. I'm just super exhausted right now.
@cscomics yeah, it's fun. But the show I'm training for is like ToonBoom trial by fire.
I know it'll be cool on the other side of this but right now it's stressed.
This whole training process is just draining all my enthusiasm.
My brain feels like it's going to explode...
@cscomics indeed. Humility and compassion are lacking these days.
@cscomics granted pushing a boundary is probably beneficial in context.
@cscomics the good humourists in the world grow up and realize there's humour outside of being offensive all the time.
@cscomics naw, it bugs me too. What really bugs me the most is that he has an audience.
@cscomics oh man, there's some assholes but this guys pretty big.
it's gotten to the point where I just don't even care anymore... and write whatever the hell I want.
Like I watch a lot of comedy. but I haven't seen EVERY piece of comedy ever. It's just crazy.
It's so hard to write humour when there's so much of it out there. it's impossible to be up on everything.
Ugh... Could today be any worse...
Fuck me... apparently Family guy already did the joke I made today...
@PatrickJMannion @comicchameleon I haven't had a chance to update it on Comic chameleon. busy with other things
Lulz at the anti-chemtrails ads on the #TTC
In this comic, a sight to behold! 
wow that four stock by @ArmadaUGS at #BEAST5 so good!
@TheOnlyTrout I wish I had a hobby like this...
@TheOnlyTrout THIS GUY! my god. so good.
This guy playing Zelda OoT Blindfolded is crazy. #AGDQ2015
@Kyattsuai wha? How? I tried last night and it didn't work.
Crazy up and down week.
Having a panic attack because of Canada post. Apparently packages to Australia are taking WAAAaaayyyy longer than anticipated. Sorry Aussies
Apologies to Patrons for the email spam. I already sent out the rewards before I noticed the balloon error.
That last word bubble is fixed. sorry bout dat.
In this comic, things get... particular. 
It's looking like I've got a new job!
More ToonBoom fun today. I think I'm starting to get the hang of this program.
Can awesome games done quick just go on forever? It's just so entertaining.
Which is cool. I did learn deformers. But I'm still way too slow in ToonBoom.
ToonBoom training wasn't so much training as me just animating.
Just heard about the NAACP and the Paris shootings. Craziness. Let's all be extra nice folks.
What a crazy fucking life I have.
And at some point tonight I cut an onion to look like pacman 
Also Lynn has a job interview tomorrow.
Going in for some training at a studio here in Toronto in the morning. Should have been in bed hours ago.
@DrunkenNovice justifiable homicide.
In this comic, The secret is revealed! 
@tavismaiden yes. This is a thing that needs to exist.
@Bartenerds right...
It's been a pretty good first week of 2015 so far.
I want Zeke's Mascot dance song from the latest Bob's Burgers as my ringtone.
Shout out to @rockpapercynic for all the love and tweets and junk (in and out of trunks) Dude's funny too. 
@Archaga I just finished Luther a month ago. So good.
Took a whole week and a vacation to fix my sleep schedule and two days to ruin it again...
Man these BBC crime dramas are really good.
@thejonnymagnum Ugh... I wish I could afford 12 dollars right now.
Animated a walk cycle and a jump cycle in ToonBoom. Still need to get a handle of all the tools. Especially when I need to add a new drawing
There's now free shipping on all prints in my Print shop. 
Added 4 new comic prints to my print shop! 
Time to cut back on everything! We don't need food do we?
I could tell at the end of a long session with that Aggro link that he was taking it easy on me. I wish I could have told him not to
No johns. I legitimately got out played.
I won one match out of the 50 I played tonight. Not afraid to admit that. Definitely got better. Aggressive links are fun to play against.
Getting wrecked tonight on online smash. Gotta put time in the lab to get better.
In this comic, a new system for managing your life. 
"I'll just play an Hour of the Talos Principle" nobody ever said.
@cscomics Yeah, on a show they're necessary just to speed things up.
He literally made it move on a straight line to accomplish this and it went on to render.
Can you make the boat enter the scene later, exit sooner, but move slower.
A friend of mine once got the best revision note.
One last thing...
Bed time for ARG.
Anyways I've ranted on about animating in Maya for long enough.
@Featherweight_ yet so many animators forget it.
@cscomics I create a shelf with selection sets that I just click and then hit s. One for body, torso and arms, head without eye pos.
These are just some of the things I've picked up animating for TV. Feature is a whole other ball game, a game where you usually have time.
Though I stress, make sure it doesn't look fucked up for render.
Also don't be afraid to break your rig for a frame. As long as it's not some Geo monster abomination and adds to the shot go for it.
Also spend an inordinate amount of time on eyes. God I hate dead eye animation.
Also if you can animate an IK arm well, animate arms in IK. Doesn't matter as long as it looks good.
@IvanDashSmith exactly.
@beastieboyed I key everything even if it doesn't have values. I treat that key pose as a full drawing. Easier to move around when timing.
The good thing that came from that 6 month stint of being angry at animation was I started ARG!
Proper planning beforehand helps, but keeping your poses clear and clean on a graph editor helps if you need to go back and fix stuff.
I ended up having to blow away hours of some juniors work because it was incomprehensible.
I spent 6 months on a show cleaning up/fixing junior animators work and it was the worst because the graph editor was all over the place.
@adamisntreal I do. But it's a secret demo cuz NDA's and junk.
Also for Godsakes if you know somebody else is going to be using your file. Keep your graphs clean. Key all curves for your key poses.
Just some animation advice.
The difference in arcs versus holds adds tons of texture to your animation. Not EVERYTHING has to be moving ALL THE TIME.
I know animators that spend hours in a graph editor and all they get is floppy, wobbly acting.
I'll only jump into the graph editor to smooth something, Euler filter or Tungsten tangent my splines.
In fact, in Maya, I rarely use the graph editor to animate arcs. I do it all be sight and by cam.
They'll I'll go in and dirty things up so everything isn't so smooth and computery.
I focus on silhouette, strong acting and good spacing.
I treat 3D animation like I'm animating in 2D. I get all my keyposes, breakdowns and then time it out.
@cscomics same, I always key every curve together on a frame like I'm making a key drawing in 2D.
Also, for you Maya people, I don't use Autokey. I know. I'm a heretic or something. Whatever.
I feel like I'd be a killer Starcraft player if I bound all my keys to My Maya hotkeys.
@Muffinhat I hear Ya. Maya is a beast of a program. Learning it was a necessity for work.
Also... While not a job, a studio in Toronto is offering me some ToonBoom training. So that's cool.
Is weird how animating in Maya is like riding a bike for me. I only hope I can get that fast with ToonBoom.
Animated a line from firefly tonight. Basically testing out a rig. If I finish it I'll put it on YouTube or something for patrons.
@TheOnlyTrout scandalous!!!
@zombieroomie oh people want to see my characters do it, it's just not going to happen because they're too close to my wife and I.
My biggest concern about drawing more sexy things is that you folks'll find out what gets me randy. Spoiler alert it's boobs.
@zombieroomie yeah I can't do that with my characters... Maybe I'll just do commission work.
@zombieroomie hey man. Your hugs are sexy.
If Nintendo and Lego ever collaborated I'd lose my fucking shit. I would literally revert back to a 6 year old.
@mtughan I was a teenager when that came out. you can't erase that music video from memory.
@d20monkey look at that bastard! And the dog's alright too I guess!
I can not believe [generation of people] don't know about [really old thing that was popular before the {generation of people}'s birth]! ;
@LovelyLadyJane this world is magical and frightening...
Oh my god, I can't believe kids these days don't know about Johann Sebastian Bach!!! #BachtotheFuture
Any of you fellow comic artists also draw the sexy sex comics?
Oddly enough one thing vacation did for me was return me to a normal sleep schedule. Been up since 7 and full of energy.
.@Lunarbaboon made this comic especially for me... I can tell. 
Cuba was great, but the internet is greater.
Back on Canadian soil!
Still in Cuba, still pasty white. happy last day of 2014.
@Tautologicaly perfect with the exception of lousy Internet.
@Tautologicaly Lynn's family takes us as a XMas gift.
@Tautologicaly yes.
In Cuba still. Haven't gotten sick or sunburnt. Still good!
@TheOnlyTrout yeah... 
On the plane about to leave for Cuba. Wish me luck!
Travel tip: be the biggest loudest bitch you can to the flight attendants so you can on the plane one person before everyone else.
Comics have been uploaded and ready to go for each update day Monday Wednesday Friday
Or don't I'm not your mom.
I still have Internet for the next couple of hours so you should check out 
Seeing as Chrono trigger is my favourite game of all time I feel I owe CT a play through of Chrono Cross.
Okay, I think I'm finally going to give Chrono Cross the time this vacation.
@trintran that's just my launch day collection. 
@rockpapercynic this is the face I dream before I have to change the sheets.
The Bacongeddon has begun! #Baconmas 
@DRainford sorry... I'll stop the comic...
@Tautologicaly but it's not as easily obtainable as coal is. I can't be bad all year and get plutonium.
You laugh at all this coal I got now, but when the resource wars start, I'll be the one with all the power!
@hijinksensue not enough bag.
Americans will never know the joy of chugging an entire container of Swiss chalet gravy.
@cscomics that's not a look of disappointment that's a look of ravish. That duck is down to fuck.
@cscomics no. It's your avatar selections.
@cscomics you'd be surprised at some studios your Twitter feed would be an asset.
Fatal incident on train may have been a suicide. Please folks if you're feeling down talk to someone. I know it's hard, but we care.
@MorboKat oh wow. Ugh. I hope it gets it resolved soon.
@MorboKat we were looking for you at Port credit. Didn't realize you were on a the incident train.
@christopheeerrr I believe so.
@MorboKat port credit station?
@MorboKat are you stuck on it? We just got kicked off.
Yeeesh. Somebody got hit by the train just ahead of us. Stay safe this holiday folks.
Cool thanks for checking folks!
Anybody else having troubles accessing 
@TheOnlyTrout ah... And now I'm back to that familiar feeling.
It feels so weird having a 2week buffer right now. Is this what not having anxiety is like? It... It scares me.
In this comic, we FINALLY go Christmas Shopping. 
and we just had the Fire Department stop by and check out the apartment for Carbon Monoxide... excitement!
I got them off the kazaa!
Back in my day we used to watch badly subbed realplayer copies of dragon ball z!
I think I dated myself with that realplayer reference.
Comics have been uploaded all the way till January 5th. I feel like RealPlayer, BUFFERED!
@Tautologicaly Ugh... It's Tim HORTONS! learn ur stocks.
@Tautologicaly diversification is key man! Think of the metchandising opportunities! This could be the next McDonalds!
@Tautologicaly did I ever tell you my idea for a burrito place that sells Turkey dinner burritos? #LookingForInvestors
It's amazing how this raw chicken breast feels like a real breast until I get salmonella from trying to lick it's nipple.
Also she Taunts after every KO.
Thought her turnip snipe game is on point. I taught her that.
My Peach amiibo is a better peach than me. She's short hop fast fall Nair-ing like a beast and I never taught her that.
@NamelessPC @rockpapercynic I was born bready for this.
@rockpapercynic @NamelessPC these puns are staring spread pretty thin...
Parent at GameStop "Do you have a..." Pulls out a piece of paper begins to read "a Marty amoeba?"
@rockpapercynic oh shit! Link em up!
I guess I should do my XMas shopping.
The BoJack Horseman Holiday special is awesome.
@TrailblazerLuke @RyankHudson or if the kitten gets glaucoma.
@RyankHudson Wait till it hits it's rebellious teenage years...
Jump on those Hiveworks Submissions guys. This is the time.
Craft Herpes are the only thing worse than actual herpes.
Okay I go to bed now...
GRAMMAR ERRORS IN TONIGHTS COMIC ARE FIXED! I'M SORRY! PLEASE DON'T KILL ME! I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH...
In this comic, we cut back for our health... 
Just finished off 2 comics gonna grab me a nap and then do 2 more.
Photo: Happy Holidays Folks! 
@GreyTheTick cool1 Im just arguing cliches can be done well again if the writers are not lazy. At this point everything is a trope or cliche
Stayed up late listening to the end of Serial and now I want more.
@GreyTheTick but what if you actually did all these tropes WELL? Like they were actually executed nicely and not annoyingly?
@hijinksensue yeah, either one is fine.
@hijinksensue black and white 2
God damnit... I started listening to Serial... And I'm hooked.
Here's a Holiday Comic from the past for you lovely folks! 
@MercWorks You should try a wife...
@Cory_Rydell Shitty I wish I could help out man, Holidays are a drag.
Smash the rainbow... 
House chores complete.
I guess I should do some laundry...
There might even be a guest comic from Lynn in there too.
I think I pretty much have the next two weeks of comics roughed out. Which is good with holidays next week.
In this comic, we try... we try so very hard sometimes... 
@rockpapercynic Should we just make out now?
3 hour was not enough sleep but damnit comics need to get dun.
@juanthefatty an accomplishment like that deserves a rest.
@Dragowar yeah. I is sleepy.
@Dragowar 36hrs of awakeness?
I Haven't slept yet and it's 12:30 the next day for me....
Okay main coloring is done on today's comic. Just BG stuff and some rendering and color correcting. But I need a nap.
@woodyafterhours She's just THE WORST
Lynn woke up. Looked at all my comic pitches and then told me to do the original one I had from last night... FML.
Literally the only thing stopping the comic from updating right now.
Ugh... Waiting for Lynn to get up so I can pitch these comics to her.
@rockpapercynic @ChiptunesWIN So good.
I say "bored" but I know they're slammed right now with the holidays.
I can just imagine a bored postal worker just scanning the same box over and over...
Canada Post: Where we process your item 16 times before we attempt a delivery.
I feel bad for all the Toys R us Customer service reps that are about to get an influx of angry Amiibo Hunters.
@TheOnlyTrout Ima take this to dm.
@TheOnlyTrout Seems like everybody's orders were cancelled.
@Shareyaworld @DrunkenNovice it's cold, we sometimes lose perspective sitting high on our webcomic thrones.
@TheOnlyTrout 
Is it rude to wake your wife up by placing a Cintiq by her head and yelling "Is this funny?" Asking for a friend.
Just wrote 12 comics in the last 40 mins. I need to pitch them to Lynn first but I'm sure one of these suckers will be today's comic.
@Tautologicaly yeah I tend to tap my feet to a drum beat but i still feel better getting up every now and then.
@davoerlo heh, no worries I was just kidding around. Hard to convey tone on Twitter. I guess I should emojis or something.
@davoerlo stop it. Just no. Now I'm having a panic attack about having a heart attack.
Pro tip: get up and move around every hour or so. Don't die because you're lazy.
Change of plans. Putting my original comic idea on the back burner and going to write something new.
I already posted the Sketch of tomorrow's comic for patrons and I will finish the rest tomorrow.
Spent most of tonight battling through sinus headaches and roughing out comics...
My humour philosophy is "broad but well" it's also my health philosophy.
I'm happy the Amiibo reddit enjoyed my specifically tailored for that crowd comic.
I'm all for celebrating excess as long as those people have showed hard work, passion and dedication before getting it.
Good on Notch for buying a ridiculously expensive house. Dude earned it.
@rockpapercynic @Patreon Execute: welcome functions;
@TheOnlyTrout You're welcome!
@SaeedFaridzadeh every. Fucking. Day.
@DenisJCaron @paulwestover HA!
Fox- Let's remake that British crime show with David Tennant and ask him to be in our american version but be less sexy...
@Kyattsuai @BlasterNation I gotta get your wii I'd thingers...
@Kyattsuai @BlasterNation DID SOMEONE SAY SMASH!?!
1000s of human rights violations and we're like "NK is so weird". Sony gets hacked, movie is cancelled and we're all "that's the last straw"
Man... I was really looking forward to seeing The Interview too...
@TheOnlyTrout I have a feeling all this #amiibogeddon will die down in January when a whole new supply comes in.
@TheOnlyTrout I'm ashamed of my collection...
@TheOnlyTrout Yeah, Play Asia is a pretty solid retailer. I've order from them before. Takes about a week and they accept paypal.
@TheOnlyTrout Where there's a market there's some assholes...
@TheOnlyTrout 
@Newtling This artist should draw that metroid dude.
@TheOnlyTrout So apparently there's a shit show going on with the Rosalina pre-orders...
@SpiderMonkey20s ha! Sleep! What is sleep?
In this comic, we suffer a terrible loss... 
Comic is up. I'll do the social media thing tomorrow morning 
Working on tomorrow's comic right now. I'll be uploading it in the morn.
@TheOnlyTrout Not Ideal but yeah... I jumped on it when i could...
@TheOnlyTrout wow... They are sold out now... that's why it was giving me errors...
@TheOnlyTrout yep. very goofy
@TheOnlyTrout I have a preorder on the american site... I was hoping I could save on shipping.
@TheOnlyTrout yeah their site is broken... it won't go past the credit info....
The Talos Principle. Play it. So good.
@IanHinck Thank you for talking about Talos Principle on just played. I've only played an hour but I'm in love.
How many animators does it take to screw in a light bulb? Just two... the trick is shrinking them down and setting the mood.
Good thing is after all this learning I'll be multi disciplined in animation.
I am Homer Simpson right now... 
Just the last couple of years it's switched to more 2D productions. And now I'm pushing to learn new things.
Not to crap on my school, They were great. it's just the trend when I graduated was 3D anim in toronto. So I focused there.
I've been up for most the night learning new software... Something I wish I had some training in in school.
@davoerlo the water part is not the problem it's the dumb music game...
Pure hatred is the Little Mermaid world in Kingdom hearts 2.
He stood over the corpse of his friend. Knuckles bloody, teeth hurting from anger. "You shouldn't have told me you had a Marth Amiibo Terry"
Phew... I was worried Bestbuy oversold the preorders on the first part of the wave 2 amiibos but I just got the shipping notice now.
Thanks everybody for all the Bday tweets and messages! It would take literally most of today to reply individually Know that I feel the love
Like the comic? Check out the ARG Patreon! 
Things that look like a dick... 
@zarf duck hunt has got some great spacing options. Right now everybody is on the Diddy train but the game and meta is still young.
My wife is being secretive and dodgy. I think sh may be cheating on me... And on my birthday of all days. #sitcomproblems
Happy "Holy fuck my inbox is flooded with emails" day to me.
In this comic, we celebrate another birthday... 
Comic is done and uploaded. Gonna play kingdom hearts and relax my life...
uploaded Hi res + Sketch ver of tomorrow's comic and a large picture of every char from the Vol 2 cover for patrons. 
Lynn made me soup. Stomach feeling a bit better. Hopefully I feel good for my birthday tomorrow.
Freaked out when I thought Rosalina amiibo preorders were already sold out. @TheOnlyTrout  talked me back off the ledge.
Ate fish and chips last night for the first time in years and now I've been in bed with stomach pains all day...
sketch jam! 
@TheOnlyTrout @JimZub all them webcomic loonies...
Heading out to Sketch Jam with my old college teachers and the current rung of students. I get to be a jaded old fart. Can't wait!
This is a great vid on logo Design. 
@LegacyControl a mans gotta dook when s mans gotta dook...
@tavismaiden hey are you going to be at ECCC? I was hoping to grab one of those Chrono trigger packs.
I'm in love with this Kingdom Hearts Arrangement. 
For my birthday I'd like to not have to take on more freelance to live...
@mkinyon very painfully.
Just applied to a couple more studios. Fingers doubly crossed.
@GastlyGhost Neither of your emails are letting my email go through... basically I need photo ref and detailed description of the commission
I just backed SmashPad: The Ultimate Super Smash Bros Mobile App on @Kickstarter 
In this comic, we question everything... 
@KtShy I recommend it. Inking in it is grand.
@Shareyaworld I hear ya... I still have to do all sorts of work today... tired and hung over...
@Newtling Especially since most of us hadn't raided in 3 years.
@Newtling Kargath and Butcher down. We got stuck at Brackenspore. A lot of our raid wasn't even geared for heroics yet. A good night.
One of the benefits of Anxiety is Insomnia which means there's more hours in the day to get drunk and play dragon age...
@Tautologicaly No silly... Hack your life!
I suggest using a computer to hack your life... especially if your name is Gibson.
ya dingus.
Lifehack: Hack your life to make things in your life easier to accomplish.
@Newtling That's my resting face
Got stuck on Brackenspore... I think we just have a lazy hunter that can't do the Flame Thrower...
Butcher down on Second attempt.
Kargath down on first attempt
Raiding with my old guild tonight for the first time in 3 years.
Why do I have to have the completely irrational affliction anxiety... why can't I have something that doesn't make me feel like an idiot.
I have no idea what any of that means...
Lynn found a beaver in WoW and exclaimed, I remarked that I've never seen someone so excited for a beaver. she just turns and winks at me.
@ChrisHallbeck as per your comic... ROOM FOR DESSERT!
@ChrisHallbeck Just erasing pooping and put it back on and when you need to poop just erase eating an add pooping. voila!
@ChrisHallbeck so much crap to remember to do...
In this comic, we deliver a warning... 
Also this week I'm going to post a sketch dump for the $1 patrons.
I'm trying to upload the rewards literally as I create them.
Just posted the Sketch and Hi res rewards of tomorrows strip for patrons! 
Oh Roxas... You're a somebody to me.
@Tautologicaly That's a terrible punchline
@TekSavvyCSR if they're going to ask me to reset the modem and router and connect directly to  the modem you can skip that tried it no luck
@TekSavvyCSR Hey toronto area experiencing slow interenet speeds and latency in WoW and other websites. Already filed a ticket. any guesses?
I hear living is an important part of the comic making process...
Support ARG! on patreon! 
I'm now writing the comic by using the @Explosm Comic generator. 
So for the last three days I've had massive anxiety issues. Today I'm feeling fairly normal.
@TheOnlyTrout which ones are you missing?
@TheOnlyTrout ha. we're both dorks.
@TheOnlyTrout ha. Just sent you an email about the Metaknight one.
@GastlyGhost I got your payment tried to reply back twice and I think mcmaster doesn't like my email.
@mkinyon naw, I'll keep it as is.
@DarkLThemsby ARG is simultaneously both me and not me.
URLs still work and junk. So don't worry there.
Also it's really hard to tell people I make a comic called "I am ARG". I make a comic called "ARG" is easier to say in conversation
I've dropped the "I am" part because I've been referring to the comic as ARG for years now.
Finally updated the comic logo on the sight to the current one.
Here's a little ARG Flash rough animation test I did for patrons last week 
Bestbuy, where next day delivery equals 3-5 business days.
In this comic, the harsh reality of when a loved one goes away for a bit... 
so... does anybody else get stuck on this little part of your garrison? 
New comic is up. I'll the social media thing tomorrow when Peeps are awake.
I was already doing it but at that goal I can support even more. it's like you're supporting a whole community.
My favourite is the paying it forward goal where I take a portion of the patreon funds and support other creators.
Just added some goals to my Patreon Page. 
@DenisJCaron never. Writing humour is obviously the easiest thing in the world.
Shout out to my patreon peeps. It's been a rough couple of months for me and you guys are helping to make it a little easier. Cheers!
Working on comics now. Monday's will be up in the morning!
DnD- We named the troll Rachel and then I set her on fire. She finally felt hot for once in her life.
Gotta go fast 8 sonics. All jigglypuff rests only. 8 foxes no items 4 stock 8minutes.
8 captain Falcons, 8 Game and watch sausage party, hammers only, cage match w/ only bees.
Smash party was a success! We had s ton of themed matches.
Princess Peach cupcakes for the Smashbros party tonight. 
@Kyattsuai 
Smash brownie cakes for tonight's Smash Bros Party. 
Like I don't think there's been such a passionate outcry for a remaster.
Ugh square enix... it's like you hate money...
@TheOnlyTrout Damnit mom! I ran out of internet. Pass me another AOL disc!
@TheOnlyTrout that midi of sugar ray's "Fly"
In my day we could hear the internets coming into our computer.
Don't get me wrong it's effective but I miss the old days of construction guy gifs and the sparkle bgs
This flat color thin text design for everything is snowy progressing into it websites with just a flat color.
I'm upset with the new DA logo only because they didn't use my OC sonic/pony tentacle  inflation porn logo. Missed opportunity deviant art
20 mins into Dragon Age and I'm already loving it.
@TheOnlyTrout yeah I'm actually kind of excited to make new mario world levels.
That was a really good Nintendo Direct. They even shared it with other companies. #Goodguynintendo #TheGameAwards
If the next Game Awards are gonna be like this we're in good shape.
Okay the new King's Quest looks great.
Totally agree with this Icon award choice. Roberta Williams shaped my gaming youth.
This is coming from a former sound guy...
Those drums were horribly mic'd. #TheGameAwards
Ugh... the sound guy needs to step up his sound game...
Oh the Broken Age joke. That... That was good.
lol... NUDITY! #TheGameAwards
Ugh... other than the sound this is a pretty good awards show... #TheGameAwards
Jokes that are actually funny? #TheGameAwards
That DOG! #TheGameAwards
This is actually pretty good... #TheGameAwards
Wait is this a Nintendo Direct? #TheGameAwards
okay... that sound needs fixins... #TheGameAwards
Sent out another round of books. No computer crash this time.
@lartist @kirbykrackle @CAH well... Now I've seen it all...

See folks the key to getting facebook followers is to have someone with 60k followers link you. It's that easy.
@mtughan @dcorsetto @JessFink @jephjacques @joeycomeau @birdlord and we love you!
@linkkoriri ah... I guess i left of the stream part. It's a live stream. so everyone can be apart of it. also thank you for considering that

Just posted the Sketch layer for tomorrow's comic for $3 Patrons 
french site got back to me. things are cool.
So email sent to that french gaming site... My french is a little rusty but "Je suis une grande piscene" means "stop stealing my art" right?
I'll try to keep the patreon pimping to a minimum but yeah. gotta try and support myself.
You can now show your support for ARG on Patreon! 
@TheOnlyTrout ah well then... I guess I'll shut up then...
so hey @Gameblog wanna take my artwork down from your article please and thank you. 
Late last night I posted a process vid and an animated ARG Gif I made for my Patrons 
@Dragowar Thanks dude!
@Graveyard_Gang Thanks man! seems to be going well!
@DAFTbyDESIGN Gracias!
@Lunarbaboon @Patreon Thanks dude!
@DrezzRodriguez Thanks for the tweet Drezz! it's much appreciated!
@Shinomu1337 @Gameblog nope.
@BouhallousKarim @Shinomu1337 @Gameblog I'd even settle for a link back to the source.
Just posted an animated gif I made to Patreon. 
@TrailblazerLuke I always wanted to be a cartoon!
@DrunkenNovice do you hate money?
@TrailblazerLuke I KANT HALP EEETTTT!
Don't you hate when it's 3am and you get that uncontrollable urge to animate.
I threw a process video  I did for last friday's comic up on Patreon for Patrons. 
Fixed the video link. The patreon video should play normally.
You can now help support ARG on Patreon! 
So the video isn't up yet but you can support me on patreon now! 
It was on the last package too... So we had to redo the whole thing.
Lol, went to mail out some packages and the computer at the post office just broke...
@betweenfailures @Tautologicaly you guys are quackers...
Just edited together a patreon video...
I'm not even a crazy shipper guy either! Its like at a 10% loss rate.
Last time Canada post lost, ruined or returned over 30 packages...
Every lost package has had a replacement sent out already.
This is a sad stat I'm actually happy about... Only 20 kickstarter packages have been lost or returned this time...
For you international folks , Canada Post is super back logged with holiday shopping so things are moving slower than anticipated.
Working on getting the last of the Kickstarter stuff out this week.
@thebgardiner @emayewhy who knew we were all so relatable?
@Dragowar I do?
In this comic, a cyber monday deal! 
yes please... 
@ObscureGent dear god man, get your phone to a charger!
My wife is having a slumber party. There's girls all over my apartment...
CAGE MATCH!!! 
No items fox only final destination guys. 
@deathbulge ugh.... Bad joke is sooooo apropos...
Ugh... Even a wired connection is terrible.
Man the online lag for smash is so bad...
@GreyTheTick also you know there's a history of people WEARING A STORMTROOPER UNIFORM AS S DISGUISE? #arentyoualittleshortforastormtrooper
Just shut up and enjoy something for once in your life.
LOL at the people complaining about the hilt of a lightsaber in a universe that contains fucking space wizards.
In this comic, we over share. 
lol...
Whatever, Star Trek was better.
incoming trolling.
I always laugh at the people that say "My entire feed is BLAH BLAH" but holy ever loving fuck we ALL KNOW ABOUT THE STAR WARS.
was going to update the comic but my server has shut me out from updating...
