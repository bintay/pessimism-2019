So tempted to make a Vine account and start making Vines :)
@AmyyyLauren_ :)
My mum tells me to flirt with famous people. I cannot flirt with an apple let alone a human being
@AmyyyLauren_ I shall make more tomorrow
There was a spider right next to my bed and now it has disappeared... fantastic...
@AmyyyLauren_ Thank you! :')
@AmyyyLauren_ I have too much fun :') :') :')
@claudiaread Thank you :)

Nobody understands how many retakes that took me
@havefaithinpip PIP
@punkftnjh You are so lucky
@LukeFriendMusic It would be pretty darn snazzy if they did
@LukeFriendMusic I did a thing and it is pretty shit but I did it

Procrastination 
@marylambertsing You are in London and I am 3 hours away... This is a sad day
@JackieHeartbeat Definitely going to cry for muffins then!
@JackieHeartbeat Beat around the bush! :') :') ;)
@JackieHeartbeat If you want me in bed you could just ask! ;) :')
@JackieHeartbeat What flavour muffin?
@JackieHeartbeat It makes me want to cry
@JackieHeartbeat Jacqueline
@JackieHeartbeat It scares me
I am honestly so scared of dying alone. It makes me want to cry whenever I think about it
@ElizaCasey_ Thank you
@ElizaCasey_ *two
@ElizaCasey_ You are welcome!  Thank you, I only have to maths exams because my main course is coursework based. :)
P.S. I completed a lot of coursework :)
@ElizaCasey_ Good luck for all your GCSE's!  Study lots and do not worry
I am hungry but we have hardly any food in the house. Might need to resort to eating mustard
I get called weird everyday but I do not care... I would rather be weird than boring thanks boo
Do you ever get a feeling that ghosts are amongst you because I get that alot
@Zak_Bagans Ghost Adventures gave me nightmares but I cannot stop watching it. What is life
When I have a boyfriend he will be my man crush all day everyday
I have too much fun procrastinating 
Powering through this coursework

I drove a boat yesterday and nearly crashed :) 
You can look at me like I am a piece of shit but as soon as you look at my family like that then I will get mad bitch

I saw a cute quote yesterday
#nevertooold #education #quote @ The Kings Head, Wroxham 
I know too many people who dislike people who have ginger hair... It is literally discrimination
@megswarr England is the superior country who has it a different day! :')
What do you look forward to most this year? — Summer holidays 
Majority of people are complaining about the Conservatives yet they won the majority? The logic

@MrsFriendie It sucks :(
@MrsFriendie I know! Personally, I dislike UKIP but I do believe that they could be a dark horse in this
People are afraid to say that they are actually voting UKIP meaning that UKIP could be a dark horse in this election.
@HeartbeatVlog This is exciting
@PINK_JessieJ She really is doing good!
@Aliina57 It is my pleasure
@PINK_JessieJ Oh wow that is good of her!
@Aliina57 Happy Birthday! I hope you have had a great day! Xx
@PINK_JessieJ What is she doing?
I voted today and I have never felt more in power than now
Tina, Ice and Pearl? Does Jessie's hair have multiple personality disorder?
@CrushOnJess_ I missed a word out! :')
@Aquilem0h Fuck Freud in the asshole
@BecaHeartbeat If you need me then I am always here
@Aquilem0h It was the unit I cried over aswell
@Aquilem0h Cheers pal
@BecaHeartbeat Yo what's up?
The only good thing to happen today is that I got a Distinction on my Psychology unit
What fucking bullshit
I feel sorry for Laura because I am ranting to her so much right now
@ElizaCasey_ Majority of people at school are imbeciles! :')
@ElizaCasey_ I was exactly the same. Yeah, I cried like a baby during leavers assembly but I only speak to a few people from school now
@ElizaCasey_ Agreed, rumours went around my school like wildfire. Now if rumours are spread around about me I ignore them or embrace them
@ElizaCasey_ In a few months you will stop caring, trust me
Tomorrow is going to consist of revision for majority of the day
@DanniJLSter I am jealous
@DanniJLSter Very excited!
Bridget Jones's Diary (Book version) teaches readers that weighing 9st 3lbs is considered "fat". How very negative and unethical!
@LydiaHeartbeat Before you all think "Why is she holding her boob?" I am actually covering my work placement's name and logo

@HeartbeatVlog ily too Rosie
Follow @HeartbeatVlog because all the famous Youtubers smell like poo (apart from MirandaSings) and Rosie is the best person ever
I am in such a positive mood and I would like to share it with everybody so please smile and remember that tomorrow is a different day. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
We should all have the outlook, positivity, optimism and happiness of a child.
Children have such big dreams for such small bodies.
Children give you a different perspective on life because they are so positive, optimistic and hopeful.

@loheartic ... what they have annoy me.
@loheartic Haha. I know, people who work hard for what they receive are respected but others who do not work hard etc. and are ungrateful...
How do people sit at home and not go to college, work etc.? I would lose my mind!
@isthatbratpit I know they are not. It annoys me so much, be grateful for the money you have and use it wisely
@loheartic I never said I hate them. What I dislike is when people who own a substantial amount of money waste it and are ungrateful.
Yes you can be rich and fly here, there and everywhere but please work hard and be grateful for what you receive!
Rich people annoy the hell out of me
I love reading so much but I never have time to read actual books

@midnightcriss I left too early; Jenny leading may have changed my views.
@midnightcriss If I am honest I wish I never left Guides. It was too boring and not up to standard compared to all of the others.
@midnightcriss Fashion designers in the making! (I look all rebellious with my school uniform and not my Guide uniform! :') )
@midnightcriss That came up on my TimeHop too! :')
@marylambertsing Are you in England
I packed my Star Wars top in my bag for me to wear today and it is a complete coincidence. I forgot it was Star Wars day
Happy Star Wars day everybody

Nipple …
Beckie is lying here chatting on the phone and I am here on Twitter with no one
@marylambertsing HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARY!!!!
@JackieHeartbeat Too right!
@JackieHeartbeat Such a lesbian ;)
@JackieHeartbeat Huh?
The only reason why I have a Jessie wall is because it took me three hours to put up and takes too long to take down
@HeartbeatVlog Yes; might have to take pictures of my wall in sections though :')
@HeartbeatVlog Gonna win
@MeganHeartbeat Happy Birthday. X
@lovatic8332 @fkndemetria I would cry
@fkndemetria @lovatic8332 I am praying that it is true though
Waking up ridiculously early tomorrow so I can have a bath before Beckie picks me up
Fucking Girl Guides. I ended up quitting too
I stopped taking dance after my class was cancelled in favour of Girl Guides
If she did not want to then that is cool, she can do football or whatever else she wants
If I ever have a daughter then I really want her to take dance lessons
I hate mannequins... I hate them so freaking much
@objessedgirl So freaking jealous
My neighbours have loads of people round and they keep banging. Wish they would shut the fuck up
People who try and start beef are not my kind of people
What the fuck have I just seen 
Me, my sister's and my neighbour were going to audition for BGT with dancing on rollerskates a few years ago
@OhmyHB Yup
@OhmyHB Not anyone I know of
@OhmyHB No I do not think that is it. People are not that sad to block people because of that
@Aliina57 Ah okay, haha
@Indyy_J You know it
@Aliina57 Nah, it is the way she was standing
What? I have never spoken to you what is this 
@Aliina57 Her stomach looks nothing like pregnancy :')
I watch enough episodes of Dance Moms to be able to know good dancing
My Secret Santa bought me the ultimate Disney songs album
I used to crawl around my playroom pretending I was in Lion King whilst watching all three films back to back
I wish they did a medley of Disney songs
If they sing Disney songs well then I will be voting for then every single week idec
@LydiaHeartbeat *oh
I love Disney music too much of my goodness
Screamo Frozen could be a hit
My brother's eyelashes are goals 
Why can't the royal family control the country and not a bunch of twats from posh schools?
@JackieHeartbeat Awkward for you
I bet the Princess will be named "Victoria Diana"
No matter what part of England you are from, you all love the Royal family
My brother is marrying the Princess idec it is happening
My brother is saying "Yay" and clapping over and over again when William put the Princess in the car
My brother is waving at Kate and William waving at the cameras oh my goodness he is too cute
THE ROYAL BABY HAS BEEN BORN AND IT IS A GIRL AND I AM SO EXCITED
@Aquilem0h Love you too
@Aquilem0h I AM STAYING POSITIVE
Brazillian Demi fans were tweeting about it so I do not know how true it is
@DeVontaaaa I have not seen it confirmed which is why I put "apparently". Half my timeline are talking about it (Demi fans)
Apparently it has been confirmed that Demi has a Ft. Jessie on her album and if it is true then I will cry!
@jk_rowling Never forgiving the death of Dobby... ever
@jk_rowling Worst decision you have made... ever. HE WAS SO INNOCENT
@LydiaHeartbeat Although if I was able to take the throne then I would
@youtvbers I can understand why but she went a little overboard when she unfollowed every single person she followed to prove a point.
@youtvbers ... messages separately and deleted the whole thing. It was so freaking kind of you do that though. I am so grateful. Xx
@youtvbers I messaged her, she never replied. I then messaged a message which was to the wrong person and forgot that you could delete...
@Aquilem0h If she does not come to Norwich or in the East of England I might not be able to see her though! :(
@youtvbers I am so out of it I blame college. I do apologise
@marylambertsing I have been a fan of yours for so long and it is my absolute dream to see you live. Please come to Norwich on your UK trip
@youtvbers ... LIKE UNICORNS
@youtvbers You smell...
@youtvbers WHAT THE FUCK JER I DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS YOU WHEN DID YOU CHANGE YOUR ACCOUNT
Watch as Mary does not come anywhere near Norwich and I have no money to travel :(
MARY LAMBERT IS COMING TO ENGLAND

@ColferKisses You are welcome. I would have been too! It will never sink in... NEVER
@ColferKisses LAURA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BLESS THE LORD'S OH MY GOODNESS
what u up to ? :) — Completing my campaign for tomorrow 
i love your eyes :) — Thank you 
you are so beautiful :) — Thank you 
Post a picture of your favorite outfit! — (I am the one on the left) 
@xShannon_HBx Cuts heal from the outside in
Mind you, Jessie's band and Alisha have been with her for years. Maybe they wanted to settle down and start a family
Whoever decides who Jessie has as her band etc. deserves Crocs for Christmas
I blame Disturbing London
Fuck everybody Alisha was my favourite
There is something actually up with Jessie... yesterday I understood at first but now she is behaving strange
What is your favorite thrill ride? — The best one I have been on is 'Air' (I think it is called) at Alton Towers 
@OhmyHB @kellie_newport Kellie apologised, leave it
@JessieJ Real question is, have you ever owned a pair of crocs? I used to have purple ones when I was 11 (They were in style back then)
@JessieJ I meant crocs for the fanbase not you but hey, life goes on
@marylambertsing Please, everybody needs hugs.
Jessie doesn't care about her fans that much that she took my friend's phone, spoke to me and then made the whole crowd sing WYA... K then

TWITTER ISN'T REAL LIFE

SHE DOESN'T LIVE FOR YOU
My Mum will always tell me if I am wrong and at this very moment of time she agrees with me
@HeartbeatCharly @lexipediaa @isthataHB  The general context of all the rude comments being tweeted to Jessie is shitty
@lexipediaa @HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB  A FREAKING MEN
@HeartbeatCharly @lexipediaa @isthataHB That is you, not Jessie. She does know who spends money or not
@lexipediaa @HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB THANK YOU
@jade_jessiej @isthatchanticep @isthataHB I apoligise
@HeartbeatCharly Do you apoligise every time you unfollow someone? Every time you believe you are right but others believe you are not?
@isthataHB @HeartbeatCharly Amen
@HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB Does she have to apologise? Is it engraved somewhere?
@HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB She apologises for every little thing she does!
@isthataHB @HeartbeatCharly Fucking thank you
@HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB How about everybody in this fanbase's behaviour towards her huh? How comes that gets cancelled?
@isthataHB @HeartbeatCharly Amen
@HeartbeatCharly That is why I put "etc"
@HeartbeatCharly She still has a personal life
@isthataHB @HeartbeatCharly Literally a follow
@isthataHB @HeartbeatCharly Fucking thank you
@HeartbeatCharly What if she wanted to get in contact to organise a night out etc? She might not want her label knowing
@HeartbeatCharly I did not mean them I meant future business partners... yes I understand friends and family
@HeartbeatCharly Not if she does not have their number or contact details?
@HeartbeatCharly Not abroad backward ana forwards. She might not have their contact details
@HeartbeatCharly All given for free advertisement and paid for by the record label
@HeartbeatCharly Clothes are used on celebrities as free advertisements... They get alot of them for free
@HeartbeatCharly ... through royalties and roughly a third of money which is earnt through concerts, merch. etc.
@HeartbeatCharly Celebrities do not own majority of the money. The recording company/management own alot of things. Singers earn a wage...
Now, this is abuse and harassment. The shit this morning was not, this is.
@ElizaCasey_ Reasons why I am hardly on Twitter
@HeartbeatCharly @isthataHB Texting costs alot for other countries and she might not have their number
People are dying in Nepal and you guys are worrying about who follows you
@123_emzy Preach
@ElizaCasey_ People are being so so so rude though. Some of the tweets I have seen are completely uncalled for
@isthataHB ... meaning that she cannot communicate with her friends/family/future business partners easily
@isthataHB ...as much as she has. Do you follow people who you do not really like/know to keep them happy? Her DM's are full of fans...
@isthataHB No, the simple fact is because Jessie does not have to follow fans. We are actually privileged to have had her notice us all...
@ElizaCasey_ I like beef between fans not freaking Jessie. I understand Jessie's side and I am literally the only one
@JessieJ The whole fanbase needs to be given crocs for Christmas idec they need them 
Lol this was my picture how funny  
Buying you all these for christmas 
Am I the only one who can understand @JessieJ's side of this unfollowing shit right now or nah?
@JessieJ You probably do not remember this but thank you for speaking to me on the phone at Newcastle;meant the world 
@JessieJ "... just be true to who you are"
@kellie_newport I adore you too. :')
@OhmyHB Pretty sure that Kellie has finished speaking about Jessie cancelling tour... just saying
@LydiaHeartbeat Wow the abuse Kellie causes...
Kellie abuses Jessie so much that Jessie feels intimidated to the point that she selects Kellie out of a whole crowd of people to speak to
@OhmyHB Kellie has the right to an opinion. As far as I have seen, Kellie asks her why she has done something and comments on it
@hopelibertyxo @kellie_newport @OhmyHB Preach, Amen
@kellie_newport @OhmyHB ... tweeting sprees so you all need to calm down.
@kellie_newport @OhmyHB Yo pals, I am studying abuse and Kellie is not being abusive towards you. And everybody harasses Jessie during...
I am siding with Jessie on this one. Everybody wonders why she unfollows people; maybe she is sick of seeing people argue
@LydiaHeartbeat *though
Jessie is still following 437 people why are you guys seeing 18 followers? 
@_Holxo Same to you too. Xx
@_Holxo You are welcome. :) We should. Xx
//_Holxo 
@Lauren_JessieJ It is my pleasure
@isthatbratpit @SaboohaR_x You are welcome

@ChlornishPasty You are welcome. Thank you, I hate it but thank you. :')
@JackieHeartbeat I was like "WTAF DID SHE DO"
@kellie_newport When I am nervous or awkward I do not speaking about random shit though. :') x
@kellie_newport I said to my friend "Look there is Kellie" and she told me to speak to you and I was like "I am too awkward for this" x
@JackieHeartbeat I thought you meant torn penis' twice :')
@JackieHeartbeat Amputate it :')
@kellie_newport It is my pleasure. :) Everybody says I sound posh. :') I think I sound like a farmer! :') x

@ElizaCasey_ I am out of sync. with everything. :')
@ElizaCasey_ I know the same old people, I never have time for Twitter anymore
@ElizaCasey_ They probably did... If they did then probably have no sense of humour
UKIP are so anti-women I hate them
@ElizaCasey_ We were too fantastic back then
This is cute 
@ElizaCasey_ So do I. :( It was shit for some people but I really did enjoy myself
Kellie has made me think, what happened to all of the "beef" in this fanbase? Why are we so kind now?
@kellie_newport You said I am pretty and I am so happy now thank you. :) (P.S. You are beautiful and ily) x
@kellie_newport Lydia rhymes with Chlamydia and it became my nickname. :') WHAT DID HAPPEN THOUGH? Got that chill factor. (Wow the cheese)
@LydiaHeartbeat This is from the same woman who called me fat when I was 13
My Auntie-in-law shocked me today. I said "Mia has such a beautiful figure" and she said something really positive but I cannot remember it.
@AmyyyLauren_ You are welcome
@AmyyyLauren_ Me and bae 
Succeeded in annoying my Auntie-in-law :)
@Aquilem0h Too bad
@Aquilem0h No sorry, you shall have to collect it
We had a family gathering today and this is the outcome of a family photo. Me and my baby cousin. I… 
@Aquilem0h What? Huh?
Baths ease period pains right
My stomach is killing me so bad I want to curl up in a ball and cry
I have realised that I am the 'Designated ugly fat friend' and I hate myself for it

@JackieHeartbeat I know I do! :) Loads of people have kimonos (although mine is kick-ass because it has blue and yellow flowers)
@JackieHeartbeat I do not follow a style though. Some days I could wear leggings and a jumper and other days I wear leggings and a kimono
@JackieHeartbeat What is the difference? I am much more a dress kind of girl
11:11 <BLACK HEART SUIT>
Today has been surprisingly productive considering I had approximately 4 hours sleep last night
I feel dizzy from tiredness how cute
@JackieHeartbeat My 9 year old sister coughed then she said "Aids" so casually I have never laughed so much
@JackieHeartbeat Thank you! :') I literally wear whatever I feel like if you could call that a style! :')

@_REJECTX UH I'll tell you where it's from, AFRICA that's where ebola's from...
I had the worst night's sleep last night and my body has gone in to overdrive
@_REJECTX
@Aquilem0h It is the other side of the fudging country! 
@JackieHeartbeat Is it bad that I am a health and social care student yet I regularly sing this
@JackieHeartbeat Why thank you :') I actually made an effort that day. :)
@LukeFriendMusic Where do you get all of your funky patterned shirts from because I want more and I only have two. I feel deprived
Jess has ebola
My shirt is so rad and different I love it so much it is my favourite 
@ElizaCasey_ Good Luck! X
@Aquilem0h Where?
@Aquilem0h WHAT?
@ColferKisses I think it may be re-runs. She looks so foetus!
I went to see my great-nanny today
I am slowly getting over my fear of cemeteries
@ColferKisses I do not have Disney Channel!
I love him 
Remember when this happened and I hyperventilated down the phone? That was cute @JessieJ 
@Aquilem0h This is actually so cute I am going to save this and keep it for ever I love you. Xx

Why does Kylie Jenner look like a Bratz doll? 
I would rather have no lips than take part in the Kylie Jenner challenge

@lukestolemybae I love you I really do I am so excited
@lukestolemybae Stalking is fun. HEARTBEATVLOG?
Can I thank the Newcastle crowd on the Sweet Talker Tour because you all sang WYA to me and it means so much I love you guys
@lukestolemybae I was like "What is Rosie doing right now, why is she favouriting this... is she stalking" :')
Why is Rosie favouriting tweets from months ago she gives me anxiety
I listened to the recording of Jessie and the Newcastle crowd singing WYA to me and sobbed like a baby
Laserlight, Flashlight... Strobe Light,  LED Light, Sunlight... girl is going to give herself epilepsy
How many songs does Jessie want to sing which are titled with '... light'
I have spent my evening sleeping and I will probably continue sleeping soon
@LydiaHeartbeat I should not have watched so many episodes of Ghost Adventures yesterday
I keep having nightmares
I have strong feelings about people dying alone. Nobody deserves that, everybody deserves somebody by their side.
My travel lines are practically non-existent :(
Can anybody read palms because I need to know whether I will die alone
I was watching palmistry videos and my love and affection lines are so short I am going to die alone
@LydiaHeartbeat I miss her
@LukeFriendMusic I was not at your show last night but I watched a recording of 'Medicine' and it is the most perfect thing ever
My Great-Grandad and Great-Nan are the only relationship goals I need 
@h0moglobin :')
@h0moglobin Their relationship is the only goals I need
My Great-Nan used to hide from my Great-Grandad before he came home from work and he always found her because she would not stop giggling. <BLACK HEART SUIT>

@ColferKisses Laurakins is my favourite nickname for you ever. I shall try not to
@ColferKisses I bet you would though, they are all secret
@ColferKisses I have tried many different lightings and angles and nothing works. Please do not put yourself down
@ColferKisses You make me hate you in a nice way :)
@beckiiiiiiii97 Nothing which I have not handled before. :') x
@beckiiiiiiii97 Thank you but you are meant to say that. :') xxx
I was dancing around my living room and I went to do a jump high kick and landed in a bundle on the floor I am so thankful nobody was around
@HBeats4JessieJ Cheers
How comes all of my friends have men falling at their feet and I do not? Am I really that repulsive
@marylambertsing I had to look up the definition for "vitriol"... since when was this a word... I am dumb
Can that magician make £100,000,000 appear in my bank account please? That would be nice
@LukeFriendMusic Good luck! X
Amanda's laugh is my favourite
I feel so proud of people when they manage to escape from an abusive relationship because it takes so much courage and bravery
FUCKING YES GO YOU FOR GETTING OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP
She came out like a small little girl about to sing some cute song and then BAM SHE TURNED IN TO A FUCKING NINJA
NIGEL FARAGE COMPARED THE TORIES TO STALIN AND I AM ACTUALLY CRYING
@MarysLilLambies She is entitled to her opinion and due to a coincidence they are all kicking off about it
@MarysLilLambies The comments are so uncalled for
@EllaEyre @georgiamaskery I AM CRYING OMFG
Mary was not "dragging" Demi. She is entitled to an opinion
@LydiaHeartbeat He has dyslexia never mind
This dude is speaking to me and he spelt "sore" as "saw" and I honestly do not know whether I have seen a spelling quite like it
I JUST PLAYED @LukeFriendMusic's VIDEO FROM HIS TWEETS AND MY BABY BROTHER STARTED SINGING ALONG AND IT IS SO CUTE
@LukeFriendMusic Why do I live in the middle of nowhere so I do not get to see this live please? It makes me sad
@MarysLilLambies I am so annoyed with everybody right now! I am in both fandoms and what they are saying is so fucking mean
@marylambertsing Remember how you are the Queen of the earth and I love you lots, yeah that is still a thing :)

@marylambertsing Feelings friday: write a poem about what colour dress you see
@marylambertsing I see blue and black but I also see white and gold
What was the last argument you had? — Probably yesterday with my sister 
People cannot control what their eyes see. Stop being so God damn rude
What is pissing me off most right now is people insulting others for what their eyes god damn see
I see the dress in blue and black and also white and gold. It is all about the eyes and how you perceive the dress
It is all about how you look at the dress
And this is how psychology works
@ColferKisses Indeed you do
Everybody's eyes and brain works differently to one another meaning that is near impossible to see exactly the same thing as somebody else
@ColferKisses I rest my case
Did you know that men are known to mix up the colours blue and green because majority of them are slightly colour blind?
What I dislike about Twitter right now is how everybody is insulting people who see white and gold
There are so many factors which can determine why the colour of the dress is different depending on the individual
@ellswindlehurst Then that is weird af because on my Kindle it is white and gold and on my phone it is blue and black
@ellswindlehurst The colour is different depending on the device you use
The dress thing has something to do with the devices screen. On my Kindle I see it as white and gold but on my phone I see black and blue
@ColferKisses I only see white and gold
@ColferKisses I am so confused
"@carrieshopefulx: 5 things 50 Shades of Grey teaches. #50ShadesIsAbuse

And if I want to sleep then I will have to put headphones in because my sister's have their television turned up really loud
I am so tired
@MirandaSings You sinned god doesn't love you no more
It has occurred to me that I have not removed my make-up and I am already tucked up in bed meaning that I do not care.
@lukestolemybae Me because it was fucking hilarious
Does my display picture and header match?
@Aquilem0h Thank you
@Aquilem0h You can't be a loser because I am a loser. My initials literally are slang for loser (lsr)
@AZEALIABANKS How very racist of you
@Aquilem0h Omfg awh
@Aquilem0h Still so funny
@Aquilem0h Person shaking syndrome much
@Aquilem0h Let's question why you hesitated to hand over the phone on the first time pls
@Aquilem0h Pst... she touched your phone
Laura is planning to come to Norfolk and I am so freaking excited I want to cry
@Aquilem0h Pst... Jessie noticed you
Why am I the only person who cares that Jessie noticed Laura pls
@marylambertsing You hardly tweet no more I feel sad
@megswarr @JessieJ OMFG I PRAY SHE SEE THE CROCS

@Aquilem0h I want you up here I truly do but I have no room in my house for you to stay and hotels are expensive
@Aquilem0h I didn't even cry, I hyperventilated and couldn't breathe. Don't come if you are too busy or do not have enough money etc.
@Aquilem0h I would cry
@Aquilem0h no, thank you. X
@Aquilem0h My mum and family think you are great
@Aquilem0h

@isthatbratpit I sense lies. :') That is all I have done for the past few days. :')
Next week I might be teaching my class on how to be a fangirl because that is the only talent I posses
"@isthatbratpit: Im still not over that Jess said my name tbh" The fact I can say this still hasn't got me yet
If you are going to Manchester have fun. :)
