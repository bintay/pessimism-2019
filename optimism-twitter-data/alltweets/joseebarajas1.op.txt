I will be alone.. To grow.. To heal.. I will be alone to make u happy. I will be alone to be at peace. I will be alone to suffer in silence
@ShaniaKelice this is a joke right ???
K then, don't reply
I'm just gonna walk.... Too much inside me
I wanted to see you but k
<PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>üèΩ
I guess...
:( I wanna be home now
I hate my life rn...
You stopped wanting that dream you always talked about
Make it quick
I can put an end to it all
You just need to remember that I will love you 'til the end of time..
I'm in conflict with living in the past and moving forward with the present.
But I also don't want to stay and suffer more if it won't pay off in the long run.. I want everything to go back to the way it was
I am not lying about anything...
I'm being honest here..
I've pushed so many people out of my life That I'm in a one man war <BOMB>
It's like an intrusion that I didn't wish for. I want to be living my stasis again.
Why was I left with this void:(
I hate you I hate you!
Omg first I meet a music producer and now I meet an actual tv show actor! Agh!!!!!! Omg I'm being blessed !!
Every time I get sad I get buzzed
It just sucks.. Feeling alone and all..
Everyone no longer cares...
I need to make my shit private so people I don't want contacting me can't.
Get on the apps and not respond back.. Okay, I got you.
You never came through..
To find myself I must kill my soul
I hope when you find the worthy one, you'll cherish him like a god..
I'm up now ! <UNAMUSED FACE> so much for sleeping in..
All I've been trying to do is sleep in... But since the morning I've gotten nothing but calls, texts, and messages, and voicemails <UNAMUSED FACE>
Cool cool <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª

Liar ! Fuck you &amp; your bs..
Ugh I hate how weak I am..
But whatever I know what's real and what isn't and if you don't want to believe it than that's your problem.
LOL, when people stress themselves out over absolutely nothing. It's hilarious like double check on the facts before assuming.
People are living contradictions
So immature
I wish I could make you feel everything you once felt. But that's only a fool's dream.
Well I guess life isn't fair and honest means shit nowadays..
It's fine... I'll get stronger.
I need you.... I needed you the most as I'm transitioning to this more complex part of my life. And all you do is question and walk away.
I guess there's nothin I can do. Truth will ought.
It's so frustrating to constantly have my efforts get me nowhere..
This is bs
I'm not a fucking liar ! Wtf
OMG this car <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Your presents... My plans... They're shit now <PENSIVE FACE>
Today was a very good day <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> it was very fun. Now I'm exhausted. Time to sleep <RELIEVED FACE>
I'm not happy... But I will get there eventually <RELIEVED FACE> I'm optimistic that everything will work its way into place.
Wish you could have been with my bro and I..
I need to stop though <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
<PENSIVE FACE> I'm so needy
Be a good guy <PENSIVE FACE> ... For me

I can't wait to get off of work... I'm so tired
Ugh finally after waiting all this time the Rogue Cut will finally be released <WEARY FACE> #daysoffuturepast
I let my emotions get the best of mw
I'm feeling it all at work <SLEEPY FACE>
It's lonely yeah.. So what.
You have to find strength to be content with things and find inner peace.
Your words they stab me deep.
It's not fair..
Damn.. That was a fucking bitch move.
It's bs... I try for what fucking reason ?
I'm just no longer a priority
I'm not important so..
I wanna share my soul with u. But you say it's been already used. I wanna be able to share my life with u. But you say it's been said &amp; done
I'm so happy ! I'm a genius
I knew it! It had to be you! It was you all along I had my suspicions ! OMG I'm clever! Mystery finally solved
Ugh fuck !!!!
How can I find out whose sending anonymous texts ?
You don't care though
I found someone that will help produce my music !!! This can really start my career !!!!
Being loving and caring is good but not being a pushover will balance it out. Not expecting anything but in content with the person I am.
Perhaps im reaching my stasis... Slowly but surely
<SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
Overdosing would be be only way you'd look good though... Your skin would be untouched...
I feel like suicide at a young age would be the perfect way to die and remain youthful and beautiful. It would be immortality at its finest.
<UNAMUSED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
I hate being needy.... I hate it, cause I never am
I guess what sucks more out of everything is because I praise you so highly... And to feel so little to you... Is just so distraughtful
You died. Rip. And that's that.
Why is it that Colombians find me so attractive ?
I should put the same effort..
I don't know how to get rid of this feeling but I know it's my choice to feel this way...
Life isn't fair but still...
I wanna see the Avengers already <WEARY FACE>
I've cut down on the fast food for a while now... I think I need to start again lol cause I miss my cheesecakes <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I feel so alone every Friday night.
Can you make it feel like home if you'll tell me that you're mine.
A million songs couldn't describe the millions of feelings I have.
I need to be alone. My train of thought is overly clouded by a storm. It needs to clear ups.
I'm just not good.
I kind of figured I wouldn't be feeling like this again... It's been such a long time. A little over a year. Life is just unpredictable
My performances are next week! Super excited <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
That was so embarrassing...
It's a small world.. And we're all connected
I hate how my family is so picky on the movies they like... They never wanna see the movies I want to watch lol
Bitches be subbing but can't say shit to your face
I can tie up my hair now omg <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I look like a cute little Asian boy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I hate you for making me want u
Whoop woop <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I'm healthy as can be... Months of insecurities are now gone
I'm afraid...
<UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> ugh ! Why am I feeling like this <FLUSHED FACE>
Gonna go on a run that I'll probably regret, cause this fat ass is so out of shape
Test results are back <BROKEN HEART>
Blah :/ so much hw to do and so little time
At least be honest on the real reason.
Wow things just go left so fast
Had to rant... Now I deleted them... And now I have be optimistic. Happy thoughts happy thoughts only
The other men.. Compared to me are superior in every way.
Bet they're all falling for you.. 
I don't blame them.
You're a god amongst kings
Just have fun.
I don't blame you.
You're young wild &amp; free
I just met someone who can help me with my music!!!!!! Yaaaaaaaaaa!!!! Considering that TV show host stopped talking to me! Now is my chance
You know that I like you and I love you
My action for this monologue is so good !!! I still have it <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
A woman can't change a man because she loves him. A man must change himself because he loves her.
My statuses are not serious <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
How did you get that way? I don't know...
I love you honey, and for the very last time. I'm fine and I'm ready to go..
You look like a million dollar man, so why is my heart broke <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>

Boring movies...
Don't think about it. That moves already been done. Gotta think fast.

The other men,
They can make you go insane.
The other men, can make you want it all.
The other men, make you happier than you ever were.
Ironic. I wanted you to stop seeing life so black... And I wasn't able to.. Then after such a long time. Someone was able to. &amp; of all ppl.
I could be your china doll if you wanna see me fall. Boy, you're so dope. Your love is crazy. Tell me life is beautiful.
All my friends tell me I should move on,
I tell them when you find true love it lives on.
Quick, it's effects are starting to kick in.
Head is on fire,
Body is crumbling,
Honey. Just spare my soul.
Keep me from falling to that pit
How can I let that black heart leave.
When it's my only antidote.
How can I set myself free?
When you're the name my heart wrote.
Oh my god.. That was so surreal..
I'm speechless
Baltimore is a 2nd ferguson. Idiots arguing without statistics or facts to back them up <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>üèº

Save your bullshit lies for someone that believes them.
Stupidity, humiliation, and utter sorrow.
<PEDESTRIAN>...
They should have focused more on her sorcery magic instead but Whedon did write some dope ass X-Men comics so I have faith in his decisions.
And I don't know why they chose to use Scarlet Witch's telekinesis and mind influence.. Like really.. That's been done. Jean, Charles. Emma?
I hate how Ant-Man and Wasp aren't in the Avengers <UNAMUSED FACE>

Lights... I... Camera... Love... Action... You.
I hate how my parents bring him up during dinner. They have no chill on the shit they say <UNAMUSED FACE>
Vegas made me but destroyed me... And my chapter here has ended. I need to leave... And by the end of this year my goal is to be free.
I need to get my shit together cause I'm a failure... I need to bring myself up cause I was just sinking.
My mom just had a serious talk about everything that's gone down with me... I hate how right she is.
I just wrote half a song ! Bam!!!
My heart is burning.
Please make it stop.
Go put it way with some water.
Wait that's gasoline!
Fire is burning, fire is burning, harder. - J
My voice is so raspy and dry... Singing all day and belting in my music class yesterday just took a huge toll on my voice.
We've got obsessions
I wanna erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week.
Sunday wake up.. Give me a cigarette.
Last night's love affair is looking vulnerable in my bed.
"Elena, who was Damon Salvatore?"

-- "He's Stefan's brother. He's a monster. And then he died....."
"Who was Damon Salvatore?"

-- "He was my boyfriend, I loved him, and he died..."
"Who was Damon Salvatore?"

-- "He was my boyfriend, I loved him, and he died.."
"Who was Damon Salvatore?"

-- "He was my boyfriend, I loved him, and he died."
I wish I was a vampire so I could turn off my humanity
I tried... And failed.
Omg Arkham Knight looks soo fucking dope!!! And if you pre order it you play as Harley Quinn <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Happy 10 ...
When that sparkle in your eye had faded, while mines remained burning red.
How did I not know aoon
Two more hours <PENSIVE FACE><BROKEN HEART>
Wish I could see u
Reminiscing on all the good memories...
Something I could die for, it's my curse.
A power of me I can't control
I'm such a loser for being happy... Just some stupid messages that aren't even good mood ones can make me this happy.
I miss your voice before I sleep
I hate when I nap and my subconscious takes over and scares me
One more day <BROKEN HEART>
Lana Del Rey why the fuck do you do this to me....
I actually feel better..
Ugh... I hate how my parents found out everything...
I'm in a dream... I know I should awake by now. But I'm happy dreaming.. I don't want to stop.
What is the name of the dog that waited for his owner everyday for his return ???...
I wish I could be that sweet boy I once knew.
You never went to the mall, you heartless bitch!
I really enjoyed last night. I don't remember the last time the fam and i hanged out so late
My drunk ass on Valentine's <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I remember how we talked for the longest and I didn't have my phone. It was cute.. I used my ds <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
When u do that.. You'll enjoy it while you do it.. But it wont be the same as when you did it with me. It won't be passionate like i made it
Everything reminds me of you
Fuck!!!!!!! Miss you
In another life I would make you stay
Maybe in another life you'll love me enough to not stray
I have been trying to look for friends cause I'm such a loser ...
I hate the person I'm becoming. I'm becoming a monster... Someone that I'm afraid of. Instead of saving me you slaughtered me
It's too early but at least my shift will be over by 4 <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I missed spending time with the fam.
But I'll still wait... I'll wait as long as I can...
My metamorphosis will include to be a lot more assertive. I feel like my change will be like a butterfly becoming a dragonfly :)
Unfortunately the start of a new metamorphosis has begun. And I'm leaving behind that weak fragile boy.
However nothing beats being with you J <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm addicted <GEM STONE>
This was an experience like no other...
I don't think I'll be able to go to work tomorrow.
The heart wants what it wants
It's you. It's you. It's all for you.
Everything I do. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Did a lot of over analyzing. And yeah.
Kind of glad i can send you texts.. And u not get them.. Glad I can call u &amp; leave voicemails for no one to hear. Because I feel less alone
Those summer nights seem long ago.
Hope you're ok.
I love you
Piece of shit.

We've got our addictions.
Self destructive, self consuming ones.
I wanna wipe away the stain of loss that spills like bright red-love blood.
The other ones. They can do what I simply cannot. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I wish I could share my lyrics

I've become the fallen angel
It's 11:30 in the morning and I'm taking a drink. Smh.
You're my million dollar man..... The things I do for love..
You destroyed me and I still took the bullets for you. No matter how bad you were... I still saw the good in you
Wtf did you do!!!! My shit is gone!!! Derek wtf !!!!
You're screwed up, brilliant, look like my million dollar man. So why is my heart broke ?
I'll still wear your things... Because believe it or not... My love for you is so strong... Why did you do me like this. I didn't deserve jt
I loved you... I love you... How could you betray me like this. I was giving you my all. And you were being disloyal and dishonest behind me
How could you have hurt me like this... You had sworn you wouldn't hurt me like you did last year. It was all a lie.
Well no sleep for me
Off to the races.
I always lose.. Whether the cost is high or low.
I was fooled again..
I'm a sad boy.

You're becoming curious for him. You don't want to admit it. I pretend to not see it. It's a lie. What we're living is a lie.

You become a fallen angel with wings of despair. You toughen up in the world of Demons and Monsters. It's the party of a gruesome lifetime.
The fall from the heavens strips away every bit of light in you. Your innocence is tainted by the dark future that awaits.
I need to control myself.

It's funny.. How no one can keep me from feeling like I'm going insane. Perhaps this is my punishment.
It's just a matter of time. And it hurts
<FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Starbucks and lunch with mother <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I died. I came back to life. But Im starting to see clearly now. Parts of me never came back. I need to go back to find those missing pieces
I wish I could be free. I wish I could fly.
But I'm trapped. I'm caged up.
By my insecurities, my fears, my goals. I wish I was set free.
The fear of getting hurt follows me like my own shadow. I can't escape it. And in the dark, it swallows me whole.
Sometimes you feel so... 
And then it just...
I saw Furious 7 today. It was good.
Your hands were on my hips,
Your name was on my lips.
Over and over like my only prayer.
I have to touch myself to pretend you're there.

Kiss me in the D A R K tonight.
1) tired 
2) don't have anything to talk about
3) over-thinking 
4) upset 
5) falling apart 
6) all of the abo‚Ä¶
I embrace my current state of vulnerability, because only when admitting to one's weakness can true empowerment unravel.

Perhaps my kids will be the first people to understand me... In a way I need that. So I don't feel so complicated and maintain my sanity.
I don't know how to get over someone as dangerous, tainted, and flawed as you.
I'd follow you down, down, down.
You're unbelievable.
If you're going crazy, just grab me &amp; take me.
I'd follow you anywhere.
Katie Cassidy and Danielle Panabaker were both once my fav scream queens. And they're both on Arrow <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Arrow is by far my new fav tv show
@ShaniaKelice I called you and U didn't pick up
Maybe not.. I don't have friebds
I have no friends so I'll just go to Rosie's house and well lose myself

I'm going to start working out so hardcore again.
I've got a burning desire for you <FIRE> -Lana
He kissed me with those lips of lies..
People take things for granted. That's a bad thing to do..
Can I get off now <PENSIVE FACE>
My stomach is beginning to growl :/
No ones ever loved him the way he has loved his beloveds.
Watching #BieberRoast and I'm so dead <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I wanna feel like a king. I wanna feel safe.
I don't know how you convince them, and get them. Boy.. I don't know what you do. It's unbelievable.
I feel so numb... And I don't know how to fix it.
Why do I feel like this <PENSIVE FACE>
You pull me close, I push away. I'm feeling hot to the touch.
You say you'll miss and I wanna say I'll miss you so much.
I've never despised a day in my life so much until now.
I'm condemned to this slumber. I'll never awake.
I like that snake on your tattoo..
That Ivy and ink blue
You were like so sick.. Everybody said it.
You were way ahead of the trend.. Get, get it.
Never plan. The unexpected always pops in
My phone is SOOO full <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm just scared of getting hurt..
I'm finally in my bed
I should buckle up for the nightmares
My birthday is coming up.. I'm going to be 19...
Everything just went down hill
I've never felt so hurt
She smiles so purely. It's tempting. That innocence. It makes every guy want to take her light. To obliterate it.
@evelynn2918 don't worry I'm not suicidal <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> !!!
I just want to nourish underneath the moonlight, and find the star I can gaze at every night for eternal happiness.
I feel numbness. I feel the dark blue. I feel death.
I feel like my shadow has slowly slithered itself from the ground onto me, constricting me as it makes its way onto my neck to consume me.
I just got inspired to write a song. Not a happy one... Not that I feel like that. It just all came to my head.
Hmm...
This night tries to scream but it's kept silent by the darkness that's consumed it's celestial light.
It's scary... You're so and im soo...
Did @_sandtea just call me Aria from Pretty Little Liars ? I'll take that as a compliment hefty Hannah <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm craving so much cheesecake right now <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Sometimes love is not enough, and the road gets tough, I don't know why.
I can't believe this...
I'm just gonna die young and remain beautiful forever..
I don't like dishonesty..

I deserve eternal damnation. It's a farewell to my soul

Same ass shit over &amp; over again.

Wah.. Waah... Waaah....
Watching Enough for the first time.. Damn.. That must suck.. Getting married having a kid.. And he just cheats on you like that. That's life
I'm afraid... To close my eyes because sometimes I see horrible things that torment my mind even after I have them open :(
When people say I'm good looking... I blush... And try not to smile. I try to be as humble as possible.
@jsnlop brought me food <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I'm having cheesecake withdrawals..
There's something so graceful about an escape from human interaction. The world is asleep.. You can really hear everything so vividly
Am I the only one that actually likes staying under the night sky when upset ?
If it could speak it would be speechless because it looks so mysterious <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
The night sky looks beautiful.
@Alpha_Trion_A3 I couldn't agree more my friend :)
I don't think people should be having kids if they can barely raise them.
Cruel World - Lana Del Rey
I feel like Aria. And he's Mr.Fitz...
I know deep inside me, that it's not for eternity
I just feel like if you're in a new relationship, there's no reason to keep up with your ex. But that's just my opinion..
I want a cuddle and watch Netflix session. But I work til 12 <SLEEPY FACE>
Cranky that I don't have food -.-

My coworker is making me crave Starbucks <UNAMUSED FACE>
:(
Old habits to keep me sane.
Im tainted. And it's deep.
I'm a reflection of the shadows that once tortured me.
I just wanna slice my throat and die painfully of both suffocation and loss of blood.
Same shoes. Same story. Same disappointment. Same shrugs. Same resolution. Same cycle.
People who are mad at Guliana for her comment on Fashion Police need to chill. Zendaya clearly can't take a joke.
I need coffee to make it through the night
@dbxenoverse @namco it disconnects me after a battle or quest <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm happy again. I think that's a good thing
No dragon ball..

I need to catch up with Pretty Little Liars <UNAMUSED FACE>
You mean everything to me
Its been a while since I've had ochata. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Sometimes my mind falls into a dark pit while my body remains full of light fooling everyone in sight.
Everyone wants to give me attitude today and I'm over it.
Unfulfilled needs.
Happy <RING>
Sometimes the past pops up in my head and whispers and torments me with a lingering pain that I can't escape.
I want a drink and some cheesecake
It's one for the money, two for the show. I love you honey, and for the very last time, I'm ready to go.
I have a busted lip, scratched up neck. Popped blood vessel on my chin, bruised head. Smh.... -.- next time I won't hold back.
I should just be famous already.
This is why I hate taking theater. My ideas are always better than the teachers I've always had. We never agree, and that's sad and annoying
My theater teacher sucks so bad!! It's ridiculous, I have yet to find a theater teacher worth my time.. It's ridiculous.
Talking to @_LovelyMermaid again was great <RELIEVED FACE>
I'm starving so much right now
I hope this never ends..
Lol, two can play the game. And I can play it better :)
I can try and pretend like it wouldn't matter but truth is.. If I lost again.. It would be a true devastation. I just try to put up a front.
Once your tainted with darkness, your perspective changes. You see things through a new lens. The world's a new place.
Do people really change ?
Phone is going to die and I'm creeped out. Just my luck
<FACE WITHOUT MOUTH> silence speaks more than words at times
I'm craving so much cheesecake :/

I wish I could change everything.
I haven't done something like this since 2013..
I Know What You Did Last Summer <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
See the sparkling purity within the teardrops.
I'm a burden..
I guess it's back to being stressed..
It's cold ! So cold <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Smh -.-
@Suplissah omg im so jealous <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
What happened to the calm and collected Jose ..
Im addicted to the darkness that tainted my sleeves. My soul is now flawed. I tried to fight it for so long. But U taught me it wasn't wrong
Sun and the ocean blue.. Their magnificence it don't make sense to you.
@Alpha_Trion_A3 you can do it <THUMBS UP SIGN><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

The night seems to be quite upset tonight.
The stars.... They're so far apart. They look lonely.. Yet alone they shine even more brighter.
Im so in love with my vocal class <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
I cant believe I sang Yayo by Lana Dek Rey in front of everyone! Im definitely becoming more confident
I sang in front of my music class right now. I think the nerves got to me <PENSIVE FACE> im sure I sounded better when i rehearsed :(
I wish this feeling went away <PENSIVE FACE>
Why do I feel so numb
Loyalty. Does anyone still carry that virtue ?
Set me on fire,
Drown me..
Hang me til I suffocate.
It'll all feel peaceful compared to living.
I've sought every cure, remedy, and solution. 
Tried every antidote, but nothing seemed to heal the internal onslaught in my mind and soul.
I'm plagued with a disease so toxic,
It will be the death of me.
A shot to d√©j√† vu
I want a ring <RING>
I'm a grey soul.
Tainted with darkness
But shimmering with a little brightness
<HOCHO><CLOCK FACE TWELVE OCLOCK>
There's this darkness that's ready to consume my soul. However, I'm using that last bit of light to remain true to myself before i get lost.
Never thought I'd hit so low again.
A leech... That consumes more than it should. You're filled with greed.
I feel a lot more confident in myself <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Why is this 5'11, 300 pound chick decide to sit in the very front ! Hello!!!!? Your highness cannot see the board!

It's 2015 and @oscartlepe still has not found my mirror <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> !
My new clothes came in.... I'm somewhat content.
I have anything you need
It's a self medication as one passes an inner trial as they find the revelations hidden in their hearts.
The darkness that is accompanied by the dead silence can not only open your eyes to see more clearly, but allows you to hear better as well.
@Meghaanmecrazzy thank you love <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FLUSHED FACE><FACE THROWING A KISS> that was soooo sweet! Made my night

I wanted feel the warmth of your body again
Can you feel me when I think about you with every breath I take?
The stars.... How small they make me feel
I need to start focusing on my acting career. I've been Sooo side tracked trying to just be an adult in life that I forgot about my passion.
But then again no one does..
You have no idea the potential you have.
I wanna watch The Loft
Im overwhelmed with despair...
I hate this burning desire inside of me that wishes me to cave into my emotions... But I must remind myself it's pointless. I can't give in.
If only our eyes were like mirrors, we could reflect what we see in people back at them with our gaze.
People seem to just be blinded from ever seeing their own beauty.
Based on many experiences in my life so far, I've found out that many people can't seem to see how much they're worth.
You'll never know what true happiness is in life... And for that. I feel sorry.
I'm want a 90s movie date !
Freedom is your drug.
Lol you're a joke... And a slut..
Can't wait to pierce my ears <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #joiningtheclub

I still want your lips on mine
Lana Del Rey was on the worst fashion list for the Golden Globes <BROKEN HEART><SLEEPY FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
I want a hug <TIRED FACE>
Consuming all my thoughts this late at night has me drunk with emotions.
Everything seems to be like a reincarnated version of the past.... Haunting me... Cursing me. And what can I do? Nothing.. Nothing at all.
You're screwed up and brilliant,
Look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?
I wanna go to the mall tomorrow with Rose and get my ears pierced <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me

Your absence is marked by a lingering presence.
It torments and whispers,
like an echo of memories raining down.
It washed away my sanity..
Wild Wild child.
You're the Prince of thieves.
Drivin' round the city
Captivating boys, acting so giddy.
My golden boy, U stole my heart.
You have no clue,
What it's like to find a golden boy like you.
Your distance makes me so blue.
Te quiero,you know it's true.

Your dark soul has tainted my sleeves. Your nomadic spirit wants me to tag along.
Your train of thoughts have blown my mind
Im a sad mad boy
My obsession with my eyebrows has resurfaced.
You can only walk for so long before you get tired. So I'm just going to stand right here. And let it be.
People change.. And that's fine. At this point. Nothing is surprising.

Hit me up and take me like a vitamin

Boy, you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
I'll serenade someone someday
Sometimes I like to just look up old 20s-60s music and just really explore the melodic symphonies from each singer and their respective era
@Alpha_Trion_A3 will be my music producer one day!!! <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 2 future stars are on the rising <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><GLOWING STAR>
I should start being a mirror and reflect everyone's actions back.
Because right now I'm a fucking lame sponge. All I'm doing is absorbing.
I could write you a love song. If you only asked for it <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> if you need one everyday lol
Just finished two half a song.. And a verse to another one. And edited an old writing I did... That cleared my head a bit <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> im content
It would be nice though.. To share my thoughts with someone else.
Sometimes I want to share my writing <PENSIVE FACE> but it's... Personal...
Is it weird though... To only feel inspired when my heart is overwhelmed ?
I love writing... It's been a passion of mine since I was 6 <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My head is a mess. I'm overthinking again. Dammit! Lol
I would be a disaster without Lana. This anger, sorrow, fear, confusion, joy, attachment, excitement, bliss, and misery is all calmed by her
Hate working 4-12 :( everyone's asleep and im just bored.

I would one day like to make love listening to Yayo by Lana Del Rey <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I'm very overwhelmed
I hate how emotional I've become at work... I feel so targeted and it sucks.

People at my job must be emotionally tough.. And I guess I'm not. Not after today.
Oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through to you..
I paint the house black,
My wedding tux black leather too.
You have no room for light,
Love is lost on you.
@OOMFNEEDS @Expels <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Day off tomorrow but I still have to wake up early .. :/
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'll wait for you babe, 
that's all I do babe.
You don't come through babe.
You never do
All the pretty stars shine for you my love.
Am I that boy, that you dream of?
His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.
His money on the side, money on the side,
Makes me a sad, sad girl.
He's got the fire and he walks with it. 
He's got the fire and he talks with it.
These venomous lips are addicting. 
Try doing me wrong, I dare you. 
But you'll be coming back, I promise.
They always do.
Xoxo -your fav <NAIL POLISH>
@Jimmy_4060 lets plan a movie night with a few close people. We all live so close anyways :) I'll bring the snacks ^_^
Unfortunately boys will be boys... @ovoxo137
At least my day off is tomorrow <SLEEPY FACE> I need a break from the drama.
I'm just afraid... To feel the cold sting again.
Every now and then the stars align. 
Boy and girl meet by the great design.
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones this time ?
Ugh. I hate how my shift got changed when I was practically already arriving work... <UNAMUSED FACE>
Bros fight. It happens :)
Sergio is probably the only guy friend thats never let me down though. Maybe it's cause he's a cali boy &amp; not a vegas guy like these fuckers
Only two people have fought so hard for me. And I've been blind to push them both away.
My fav <BLUE HEART>
@ovoxo137 is fucking high as hell <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I FOUND NEMO AND DORY 
I wonder if anyone thinks I'm even worth being afraid to lose.. It seems im always afraid to lose people.
It stings... Feeling so alone.
Bitter sweet feeling <RELIEVED FACE><PENSIVE FACE> ...
It takes two to tango. And there seems to always be that one person who is not willing to get on the dance floor.
No one even knows how hard life was.
I don't even think about it now because,
I've finally found you.
Oh, sing it to me <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Honestly... What can I say. You have me speechless. And I'm going to sleep with the biggest smile <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
This New Year's kiss had me feeling so electric <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
This is a huge dilemma... I can't think... <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> !!!!!
I don't know what to wear <BROKEN HEART>
My plans today have officially been canceled <SLEEPY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><BROKEN HEART>
Perhaps it's all in my head... Perhaps it's not.
Come and take a walk on the wildside, let me kiss you hard in the pouring snow <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><SNOWFLAKE>Ô∏è
You like your boys insane.
It's snowing <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a night time of today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul
There's only so much someone can do
I'm suppose to be the prince, but I'm working for such a stuck up, wanna be "princess"
Not at some retail store moving all this crap.
I should be sleeping right now..
I need to buy a pair of gloves ! My hands are freezing right now. Soo cold
It was on a winter night when I realized that one day we would all run out of summer.
And I don't know how you get over, get over someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you.
Wow... He called me something different <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> that's an improvement ...It Literally made me chuckle. Night made.
I just kind of wanted to mean something...
let me put on a show for you
Writing this song... And it's coming out so good :)
Its an unexplainable moment when there's nothing but darkness and silence surrounding you. And you can see and hear clearer than ever before
That awkward moment you try to send @AngelLagana a message and U send it to the wrong person <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't think anyone's ever gone out of their way to ask me out like that before.
My mom found all the stuff I had in my drawers of when I was asked out on Valentine's Day last year. I forgot I had that stuff. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Work flow -.- hopefully I can get an earlier shift <UNAMUSED FACE>
I didn't hear much from you today... But I'm just glad I was able to hear your voice. Especially after the things that happened.
I kind of just wanted Someone to talk to
I don't wanna be here alone anymore !! I can't stay here till midnight by myself!!! Someone get me out of here <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
One of the patients just called me a "mamacito" <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> !!!!!
I get this feeling like, it all could happen. That's why I'm leaving you for the music, you for the music. It's true.. It's true <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@DomUrbanGent @ChildishChad what if they don't have a mother ?

Everything has a flaw.. Believing otherwise is a fool's mistake.
@ShaniaKelice you did that last night to me <UNAMUSED FACE> at least I'm at work!!! You were ignoring me for someone else!
@Suplissah cherish those two dollars with all your heart <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Nothing sucks more than having a gloomy day and having to stick it out at work.
Unfortunately I guess... I shouldn't have expected much..
I feel bad for turning down offers to go on dates with these guys... Hopefully they don't feel bad lol.
with someone and the next day you ain't nothing to them.
Break free from the mold of society 
Open your mind 
See things differently 
Question everything

Perhaps it's my exhaustion from work or maybe it's my right to feel as a human being. But I'm just upset right now. Done with today. <SLEEPING FACE> night
Ask someone out only when you're ready to be their ride or die ! :)
I'm soo bored :( ........ Ugh!!!!!!!!!

It sucks that I work 4-12 for the rest of the week <DISAPPOINTED FACE> I won't be able to go out at night :(
You're not the ideal dream I wished for,
But you aren't like the awful soul I escaped from.
Perhaps what I needed, was something in between.
The heart wants what it wants
I think receiving good morning &amp; good night texts everyday would be so cute. It'll be my fuel in the morning &amp; my goodnight story at night <RELIEVED FACE>
I'm sleepy... And grouchy. The last thing I need is for this Nigga to try to spit game <FISTED HAND SIGN>

Great my card got closed down thanks to suspicion of fraud :/ and my my back up card only has 40 dollars <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

He got all ready only to get his heart broken.....
It's so heartbreaking seeing one of my patients lied to by his parents saying they would pick him up for Christmas Eve but they never came
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing.. But he was chasing paper. Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard.
Love is mean. And love hurts.
Shania always introduces me to the weirdest gay guys. Lol is she TRYNNA hook me up all the time or what <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I had to pretend to be cold so I wouldn't cave in again. I had to pretend to be tough, so you wouldn't see me crack.
I still don't know what to plan out for Christmas.. .-. I'm usually scattered with ideas... Hmmmp.
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> money is the anthem of success. So before we go out, what's about address <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric. And everybody knew it. When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him
Swinging in the backyard,
Pull up in your fast car, whistling my name.
Open up a beer and you say get over here, and play your video games <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>

Who wants to go see into the woods with me <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> it's one of my favorite Broadway plays <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
You can be my full time baby, hot or cold.
I have no plans christmas.... I'm a sad boy
@oscartlepe I'll cook you some then !!!!!! With some lasagna as a bonus ^_^
Can it be 8 already so I can get off and eat. I'm starving <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Me and Latrice just cooked some chicken breasts and Mac &amp; cheese with some veggies ^_^ ... The patients love us !! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Your smile runs through my mind all the time
The two caretakers are awful and so is the manager.. Me and Latrice are new and we are doing way better... Idk if I should file a report
These caretakers are sooooo rude and mean to the patients. They basically do everything we aren't suppose to do... <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
Hopefully my four new patients like me well enough to not rip my cardigan or my hair out #caretakerproblems 
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise. No one compares to you, I'm scared that you, won't be waiting on the other side <PEDESTRIAN>
I need to go for a walk. It's not that bad outside.
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.
You reap what you sew
The end :)
And the princes both ventured off into the castle to celebrate and ventured off into that happily ever after
So he rewarded the boy with a kiss. And that broke the boy's spell, and the boy also became a prince.
The prince was so astonished that someone would go to such lengths for him, especially for his favorite like green rose.
When he finally arrived the poor boy was filthy covered in thorns and dirt... But the Rose kept its beauty and grace preserved.
After a week's worth of traveling he finally got the rose. And he quickly ran back to the castle to present it to the prince
However all he could picture was the prince's smile and so despite wounded, he journeyed deeper into the forest
However the forest was very tricky to explore and the boy fell into a bush of thorns.... And struggled for the lime green rose.
And so the little boy went off into the forest to to pick a lime green rose that blossomed only once per year in the winter's cold.
The little boy not having much to give, still wanted to give the prince a gift. Though not great in price,the gift would come from the heart
You can never talk to someone you like without people automatically assuming you guys are in a relationship.
Now it's time for happy vibes <RELIEVED FACE>
Even when the bestie replaces you, you know then that you are completely replaceable <MAN AND WOMAN HOLDING HANDS><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Everything and everyone in this world has a flaw.. Unfortunately some more than others lol..
I wonder what I should wear tomorrow... I can't wait to meet the new patients ^_^
Honestly I'm just gonna take ten steps back. <PERSON FROWNING>
People were right <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> !
Watching Valentine cause it brings back memories of my scary stalker. Also because I needed a scary movie to watch Idc if it's Xmas season.
I just noticed this bruise on my chin <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> .... It's only been a week and I'm full of injuries already.
Once the lips touch the venom, it's an intoxicating effect that leaves you dazed and hallucinating with what could be...
I wanna see into the woods so bad !!
People have their past filled with lovers and memories, how can I simply compare? I'm just a simple human being.
It's scarring to feel like you may never be good enough for anyone again <PENSIVE FACE>
@ovoxo137 cheers <CLINKING BEER MUGS>

Going back and forth... You just come to the end of the road with some people
Perhaps it's just... Pointless...
I got a burning desire for you <FIRE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I push you to the limits cause I just don't care <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I drive fast, radio blares, have to touch myself to pretend you're there <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Your hands were on my hips, your name is on my lips
Over over again, like my only prayer <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
It's hard.. You were my best friend as well.
To be one step closer to the supernatural... It would be wicked. <PENSIVE FACE>
<PENSIVE FACE> great I guess I'm not gonna witness a real life possession <BROKEN HEART>
Just sucks how unimportant I feel now..
Just... Need to disappear
I'm a monster.... I've entered no man's land and there's no going back.
Shit is about to go down tonight
OMFG
The heart can't help but fight for its feelings
You're still an innocent..
It's the realist and roughest rite of passage
Just gonna go out and meet the grips of Death
I know where I stand in comparison...
A hug would be nice..
Como calmar esta profunda obsesi√≥n, como le explico al mi alma que se termino.. Me estoy volviendo loco por ti...
Que hasta en mis sue√±os te veo.. Sin ti yo me muero..
Y como sanar este profundo dolor.. Siento correr por mis venas tu respiraci√≥n. Estoy tan conectado a ti..
Como poder recuperar tu amor, como sacar la tristeza de mi coraz√≥n. Mi mundo solo gira por ti..
Wish I could just get this one Christmas present ..
I should go to sleep...
It's being burned alive to the max.
This hurts <PENSIVE FACE>

Now let's be clear, I don't have time for anybody new right now <OPEN HANDS SIGN><UNAMUSED FACE>
I don't know about this... I can't afford to put my guard down again..
Maybe I should give this a chance..
It's amazing how I had forgotten all those memories all this time.
Same initials too... It's bizarre.. It's d√©j√† vu...
It's been four years.... It all began there... My change.. The fighting.. The tears.. The heartbreak.. The addiction.. The unhealthy love..
Extra√±o tus besos..
And I don't know. I could crash and burn but maybe at the end of this road I might catch a glimpse.

My subconscious just likes to remind me while I sleep..
But I know that it's happened. I'd be an idiot to tell myself that act has not been done.
Waking up with horrid dreams like that is just great...
Como dormir con estos sue√±os ..
This whole dm spamming about complete nonsense from all these stupid people are getting on my nerves!
That pic tho... You never looked so beautiful... ..
It's a bittersweet feeling going through my phone..
This is so frustrating !
I hate when people give your number out to a guy they think you'll like <UNAMUSED FACE> wth..
Presents! What a beautiful sight...
It don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight.
You're all that I need, underneath the tree <CHRISTMAS TREE><WRAPPED PRESENT>
But if you send for me you know I'll come,
And if you call for me you know I'll run.
I'll run to you, I'll run to you ..
This love will be the death of me, but I know I'll die happily ^_^ ...
So baby whenever you're ready, come and get it <RELIEVED FACE><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

I honestly hope I can love and feel the love like they do..It just made me tear up <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è I've never seen such lovebirds still be so lovey dovey
My mom made a cute little video for my dad with all these photos ... They were each other's first love and that kind of love is so touching.
What a dream
Let me wake up to the sound of your breathing
Now it's time for a new mark to imprint onto my flesh. A new rite of passage
Last time i imprinted a symbol onto my body that helped me change as a person... Reminded me of who I was... What I had become
In my bed now.. It's colder but I'm off to catch some ! Peace <VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
Soon I'm going to be removing people from my life... People who are just negative, cause I don't need that with me
Hold me closer one last time, say that you love me, in your last good bye.
I love having conversations with people with a vast intellectual perspective on every aspect of life. It makes feel normal.
I'm slicker <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

I'm soooo sleepy <WEARY FACE>
This is the last time.

Facebook is just too much! I think I should deactivate it.
It just sucks...
The haunted house is gonna be so far <PENSIVE FACE> I'll never be able to go.
You're the Bill Compton and Damon Salvatore to my heart. Bad and painful addicting to my soul. But you've become a necessity in my life now.
I can't help but feel so down sometimes <PENSIVE FACE>
Where have you been? Where did you go? Those summer nights seem long ago. And so is the boy you use to call, the king of New York City..
Maybe if I become more prettier, then I'll be your baby..
It's time for me to go through one more transformation.... I have to do this.
I'm a sad boy <PENSIVE FACE>, I'm a bad boy <SMIRKING FACE>, I'm a mad boy <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH> ..
I'm over wanting all that now. I can't believe how silly it was....
No more of that naive streak. It's over <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Im just glad I found my inner peace and from now on I'll have a realistic vibe of what will happen in the future.
Hopefully today isn't any shittier than yesterday tbh
I'm so happy for the friends I have <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
The temptation to drink tonight is at its finest
So many things ruined my day today <SLEEPY FACE> can't wait to one day move out so I can have peace in my home.
I just wish everything was different in my life.

I found my dream car <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> hopefully I can get it !
Anyone wanna go to this haunted house where they actually touch you, throw you, and tie you up. None of my friends can hang <SLEEPY FACE><BROKEN HEART>
This week is gonna be a test.

Just wanna be back in Vegas.
