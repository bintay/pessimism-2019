I guess I should study for my finals?
Ugh. This hot water feels so great.
Going to shower and lie in bed naked because I HAVE NO FUCKS. CLASSES ARE OVER. DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOMEWORK ANYMORE.
Can't wait to see Jenny. :'))))))))))))))
I'M SO EXCITED FOR SUMMER.
My stomach has been hurting since yesterday. Make it stoooooop. :'(
I look like shit seven days out of the week.
My stomach has been hurting all fucking day. Wtf.
<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
SO MUCH TO GET DONE TONIGHT. I HATE MY LIFE SO MUCH RIGHT NOW.
I can't wait for graduation but I'm super terrified of everything that's going to follow.
Lmfao when you're trying to sleep and every cringy moment from your life jumps to the front of your mind.
I wanna go see Avengers this weekend but I have so much to do. Hate the last weeks of school. :c
YES.PREACH. 
Tired on a daily basis.
I just realized I never applied for financial aid. Shit.
Three more weeks of school. The longest three weeks of my life.
*bed 
*school 
@werah4 it's okay geel nauls make u feel better
Lmfao yeah sure. x) 
@werah4 nah I'm throwing a party
@werah4 bish you can't skip 20. x)
OH. We're under tornado watch. That time of year again. :-)
@werah4 NO. YOU HAVE TO BE 20 WITH ME.
I'm in my twenties. That still sounds weird to me.
I just don't think I was meant for school. I learn better outside of class. :(
It's thundering super loud right now. The heavens feel my stress.
Glad I'm not the only one having a shitty time in college. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I KNOW. I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT. 
Having too many things to do paralyzes me. I literally lie in bed and do nothing. Pretty much sums up my whole college experience.
These last weeks of school have me stressed to no end.
I wanna go see the Avengers Friday but 80% sure Anna will have to work at night. :c
I think I missed the memo about how fun! and super exciting! college is supposed to be. Definitely not having fun. I feel like 2007 Britney.
I hate college so much.
The more work I have, the less effort I make. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Some people need to learn to chill the fuck out.
Fucking Tom. 
Soooooooooo hungryyyyyyyyyyyyyy
That's how college makes me feel.
Sometimes I get the urge to just get a buzz cut, stuff a one-pound burger in my face and bake myself under the sun.
I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know anymore if I want to do journalism. I'm terrible at it. :(
I feel like death.
@kerrancedear @tinatbh @werah4 2TRU
Lmfao going to school for journalism but I suck at interviews. Okay. :-)
@werah4 so expensive though!!!!! &gt;.&lt;
Anybody want to give @werah4 a ride to Dallas so she can go to south by so what with me? :(
"@werah4: I'm just tryna go to south by so what with my nigga @sleepycoyotee" help a nigga out
You know what'd be nice? An email service that writes for you because I fucking HATE emailing teachers. Or just anyone for that matter.
@SoulfulThinkin okay almost everyone. x)
Everyone I went to school with is either having a baby or getting married???? or both???? what????? I still don't even have a job?????
Two more weeks till spring break. I can do this.
"@werah4: I just want to get out of el paso and away from everyone for a bit" SOON
I want to graduate already. I just don't want to do all the work.
I can't believe it's already time to get an internship. I'm not ready! :(
@kerrancedear HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH TRUE
I can barely hang onto my school stuff.
How do people balance school, work and a social life? HOW.
I'm so glad I don't have math anymore. That class was literally sucking the life out of me.
Oh well. :-)
Oh fuck. I just realized class starts in 10 minutes and I'm just sitting here eating cereal.
Well, guess that answers that.
@JoshVallez WHAT THE FUCK
@JoshVallez for the last time. 
Somebody give Sarah 600 bucks so she can come here and we can go to south by so what. :(
I just want a Friday the 13th tattoo already.
I still have so much snot. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Whatever, dude.
My nose is so stuffy. I sound like creeper because I'm having to breathe through my mouth.
My whole body aches.
I hate being sick.
@werah4 it's for my journalism class. x)
@JoshVallez you can do that? o.o
500??????? HELL, NO. You've got to be fucking kidding me. No book should cost more than 500 fucking dollars. That's nonsense.
All this jumping around is making my head hurt.
If the cheapest price could be found in one place for all my books that would just be fantastic.
Looking for the cheapest textbooks is so fucking stressful.
"@werah4: "@sleepycoyotee: I miss everyone already. Wish I could've stayed just a few more days for Jonny Craig ."" 2TRU
I miss everyone already. Wish I could've stayed just a few more days.
I don't want to leave my cat. Ugh.
@JoshVallez TRU BRB CRYIN
Last night in EP. :(
Being on post always feels weird. Makes me miss Korea.
When is my dad getting off work? I wanna go eat sushi already. :(
I don't want to pack. <WEARY FACE>
I really need to stop watching Korean dramas so late. They just get me super emotional and homesick.
@_Saaanders no thank YOU!!!!!!!!!
Thank God I don't have any Friday classes this semester.
Oh my gosh I just accidentally hit my cat in her face and now she keeps backing away from me. I'M SO SORRY. <CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
Going to start putting money aside for south by so what RIGHT NOW.
@werah4 MY HEART IS TOO FRAGILE FOR THIS RIGHT NOW I WANT TO SCREAM AND CRY AND JUMP AND LAUGH
@werah4 SHUT UP DON'T LIE TO ME
@werah4 ??????????? c:
The closer I get to my last day the more overwhelming this shitty feeling grows.
"@werah4: I'm so tired. I'm gonna go sleep at @sleepycoyotee 's house on my lunch break if I even get a lunch break" nap time at my house ;)
I still can't believe I'm already leaving next week. This break went by so fast. :(
@Italiian_06 when did you want to take him then? :o
@Italiian_06 were you still going to keep him for a day? :o
@Italiian_06 hahaha that's fine. x) I'm always home so just whenever you have time. :)
Poor baby isn't going to have anyone to cuddle with after I leave.
Leaving my cat is going to suck so much. I just want to take her with me already.
Really hope you're not going to avoid me for the rest of my stay because that'd be real shitty of you not to even say bye.
@Italiian_06 okie dokie :)
@Italiian_06 that's fine! Just letting you know he might puff up around you. It took him awhile to get used to me. &gt;.&lt;
@Italiian_06 yeah of course. It's usually scared around my pets though. :o
@Italiian_06 he just woke up :) 
@Italiian_06 yeah if you are! I just can't take care of him. I'd love to but it's not a good time. &gt;.&lt;
@Italiian_06 do you still want a hedgehog? :o
That'd be really be the best birthday present if Sarah could come in March. :(
"@werah4: I'm gonna go trash @sleepycoyotee 's apartment in march <WINKING FACE>" OK BB WILL BE WAITING
Still feel like shit.
"@cee_elloo: If I wanted your boyfriend I would've had him by now." SAME AF. Some people need to chill.
This will be a good year because Sarah and I WILL go to south by so what. Nothing and no one will stop us.
First struggle of 2015: waiting for the banana bread to finish cooling.
Be thankful for your penis.
Really hate being a girl right now.
Fucking cramps have me paralyzed on the floor. What a great start to the year.
Why the fuck are there so many people at Walgreen? ._.
I wish Denton wasn't so far so I could make weekend drives.
At least I'll be moving into the new apartment. But still, wish I had more time.
I have two weeks left. Wtf.
I feel so fucking gross. Ughhh. Great start to the new year.
lol sarah and I are gonna walk in right when midnight strikes
CHARLES. HURRY YOUR ASS UP.
This is why I didn't wany my mom to take the other car. I seriously need to get my own.
I know he's talking to the pastor. You can talk to him on Sunday, Charles! Let's go!
Could my dad be any slower?! @werah4 and I have a new year's party to be at!!!!
Eeeee so excited for tonight. I love new year's!
Finally it's cold enough for the clothes I brought. Geez.
Hm. I see you're still ignoring me. Okay.
My body is already super sore. Ice skating wears me out. <WEARY FACE>
I love coming home to cuddles from my cat.
Suuuuuure.
WARMTH. I CAN FINALLY FEEL MY FINGERS.
I feel like I have a headache but I don't. How does that even work?
Lol I just love when my "best friends" stop talking to me out of nowhere.
You stress me out.
You're not mad at me but you're not talking to me. Makes sense.
"@werah4: I don't know how to flirt so good luck trying to figure out if I like you or not" TRUUUUUU
Why am I so tired?
It's giving me a headache. I just want to watch tv in peace.
I fucking hate when my mom drinks. SHE NEVER SHUTS UP.
Feels so nice to wear contacts again. :')
I am so fucking tired of your shit.
Are you seriously ignoring me????????? What the fuck, dude.
Yes. Showered and I feel SO much better. I could just fall asleep right here at the kitchen counter.
Too much blueberry cobbler has been consumed.
Lol brb burnin down the house
Fucking mouse just disappeared. WHERE ARE YOU.
Why does my cat keep bringing mice into the house?????? Staaahp. They're not welcomed. :(
"@werah4: @sleepycoyotee almost killed us tonight. Trying to drive while you can't see out of the windshield is a bad idea." HAHAH FUN NIGHT
Well that wasn't a very pleasant dream.
Been watching some pretty weird movies tonight. x)
Really, REALLY craving ramen right now.
<PERSEVERING FACE><PISTOL>
The whole time I was just like wut.
Hands down the weirdest movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life.
I'm in so much pain. The wire from my braces is poking out and ripping up the inside of my mouth. :((((((((((((
It's too early to get out of bed.
The snow isn't even going to last.
I slept so much during the day. My sleep pattern is all fucked up now.
"@adrianrocksocks: "@sleepycoyotee: Stupid, tell her you love her!" *cum on her face!" truuuuuuuu
Stupid, tell her you love her!
This movie is making me want to cry. :(
@werah4 r00d
"@werah4: I hope I don't work tomorrow" I hope you don't work tomorrow too
I can't decide on what to watch. I can never decide on shit period. ._.
I think some hot chocolate and netflix will do right now.
Oh my gosh, I ate too much. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
Oh that's nice. Because that totally wasn't the most awkward encounter.
Lol when holiday dinners get ruined
Swear my sister and my mom are so dramatic.
Like seriously, that fight wasn't even necessary.
Lol anyone want to go to the movies because it's super awkward in my house right now :-)
What the Christmas tree is like in my house. 
Ugh I can't stop sleeping.
I'm so sick of the walking dead. That's alllllll my sister and dad have been watching. :(
Okay, if you're gonna force me out of bed to open presents then actually open presents. Wtf. -.-
Wtf why would you tell me all that? That's so sweet. Ugh. :cccccccccc
I can't believe the year is already ending. That's such an unsettling feeling.
One day I'm going to travel to Alaska on horseback because why not.
99.9999999999% of the time I have no idea what I'm doing. Like right now.
Craving pancakes.
It just creates waste.
Why is wrapping even necessary?
I still haven't finished wrapping everyone's gifts. Ughhhhh.
I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK YOU PEOPLE ANYWAYS.
When everybody stops texting you at the same damn time. &gt;_&gt;
Stop taking forever to text baaaaack. I need to know these things NOW. -.-
I've been trying to reach you but your extension cord wouldn't reach that far.
I feel like everyone's becoming prettier each year and I'm still here looking like a factory defect.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH THIS DOG IS FUCKING CRAZY
I can't believe my mom left my cat in the garage. Wtf not cool, moooom. -.-
@ritoburrito_ Happy Birthday Jesus <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I don't want to go to church. I just want to lie in bed and be lazy.
Why are we going out to eat at four? That's so early. Who eats dinner at four?
Same. 
Wtf today's Christmas Eve? Since when? I thought tomorrow was going to Christmas Eve. Oh.
@Italiian_06 for real? :O
Lol does anyone want a hedgehog
I think I got the hedgehog out of impulse. I'm terrible. .-.

HAHAHAHAHHAHAAAHAHAHA I'M LETTING MEMOW SNIFF MY MASK AND IT TICKLES SO MUCH
You better not fucking tell me to come over. I'm doing a face mask and ready to jump into bed with my cat and book. Fuck off.

You fucking suck.
Some people just need to chill the fuck out. ._.
Ooooh boy. ._.
Christmas shopping DONE. FUCK YEAH. Now to wrap everything. Oh the joy.
I'm so fucking confused. ._.
My nails take forever to grow out. :(
Am I overreacting? Maybe a little.

Are you an asshole? 100000% yes.
Exactly what I predicted was going to happen during break. Fucking knew it. :-)
Ugh. That pisses me off so!! fucking!! much!!
Yeah okay. Fuck you too.
Wooooooooow. Super rude.
The way to my heart is to buy me food.
@werah4 YES I AM I NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
"@werah4: I hope my baby is okay <CRYING FACE>" yes am ok ty
OH FUCK ME. I forgot to get ready for bed but I already got in.
I'm so tired that my eyes burn.
When are my contacts gonna get hereeeee? I'm tired of wearing glasses. :'(
I am so tired. Wow.
Christmas shopping makes me want to stab my fucking eyes out.
Can't sleep. What's new.
@werah4 GOOD. WATCH IT FOREVER.
@werah4 
Can my cat come back into the house already? I want to go to bed. u.u
When did everything turn so dull?
Forrest Gump is on tv. Brb cryin
Maybe it's all in my head.
Still can't wrap my head around that dream from last night. Like really, what the fuck. ._.
I could stay in bed with my cat all day.
I still have a bunch of Christmas shopping to do. Kms.
I don't want to get out of bed.
She better not bring in another fucking mouse.
My cat is STILL sleeping. Wish I had her life.
Everyone needs to hurry up and come over already. I hate waiting. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I don't want to get dressed. <WEARY FACE>
Someone come wrap these presents for me. :(
I'm just wasting time. I should really get off my lazy ass.....
I could just watch Spirited Away all day long and not even get tired of it. I love it so much.
I can't fucking wait to get my tattoo. I want it NOW.
Oh shit. I never wrapped any of the presents. Presents don't always have to be wrapped, riiiiiiight? :-)
@JoshVallez you after the game. 
Everyone's coming over in less than three hours and I'm still on the couch in my pjs. Am so lazi.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. 
@JoshVallez ask him if he wants to play the silent game.
I love you too. Please. You don't have to bring gifts. <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
WHAT THE FUCK MEMOW. Stop bringing mice into my room. <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
Why does everyone in my family wake up so early??????? I JUST WANT TO SLEEP IN.
Breaks my heart.
I love getting kisses from my cat. ♡
My cat brought a mouse into my bed. She needs to stop. <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
I need to get my eyebrows done but I'm so lazy. :(
@werah4

The mall is going to be closed by the time Sarah texts me she's out. -____-
Wat da fak sarah you were supposed to be off work like 30 minutes ago. u.u
Why is hair stuff so expensive? I just wanna put purple in my hair. :((((((((
Oh thank God. She's in my closet.
I hope she's not out in the cold. :(((((((
It's raining and I don't know where my cat is. D:
I have zero patience. I hate waiting on people.
Saraaaaaaah. Get off work already so we can go to the mall. <WEARY FACE>
I can't find the litter scooper. .______.
I really need to start carrying around cash. I owe so many people money. x)
I want food.
Food.
Everybody works but me. O.
Hurry up and get out of work, Saraaaaah. I want to eat. &gt;:c
But really, pretty sure all I have is ramen.
Jk don't come, Sarah. We'll both starve. There's nothing to eat. BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A PICKY EATER.
I'm supposed to meet @werah4 for lunch soon. Can she just come to my house so I don't have to change? I mean it's right there. <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I'm still pissed they're not showing The Interview. &gt;_&gt;
Wtf is my cat always doing in my closet?
I still need to get two more presents by Friday but 1. Don't want to get out of bed and 2. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO GET.
My head hurts so fucking much. :(
Why won't my phone charge?????? :(
I am fucking exhausted.
I'm back! I'm back! I'm back!
Halfway to EP!
It would be super windy and cold the day I'm leaving.
So fucking tired.
It's so cold wtf.
I am so fucked.
I hate packing and moving. :( after this apartment I'm not moving again for a fucking long time.
This literally explains my whole life. 
Still. So. Much. Packing. To do. BRB CRYIN
Still have a shit ton of packing and cleaning to do. AM FREAKING OUT.
I feel so exhausted. Not down to drive eight hours tomorrow. :(
Swear I have the bladder of an 80 year old. I have to pee ALL the time. I don't even drink that much. e___e
24 MORE HOURS.
Is it one yet?
Grades will be finalized at 1 PM. So far away. :cccccccc
I miss having super late night conversations. I can't even remember the last time I had one.
Why can I never sleep before 2? :/
Babygirl, twist away.
@Mister_Pilgrim we should hang out when I get back! Rene too. I haven't seen him in awhile. ;o
@JoshVallez you're boring.
@Mister_Pilgrim like you! I don't think I've seen you since graduation. ._.
@Mister_Pilgrim because I'll get to see everyone. c:
AFTER TOMORROW I'LL BE ON THE WAY TO EL PASO. AM SO EXCITED.
I am home. I have changed. And I do not want to pack. I just want to sleep.
Parks and Rec finished shooting the series and my insides are slowly dying. I do not know how to cope with this.
I have not worn a bra for the past five days and it feels glorious.
My birthday is coming up. Just saying. 
I feel nervous going home this time. I have no idea why. .-.
So many useless clothes. ._.
Oh my gosh, packing is making me realize I seriously need to clean out my closet.
Someone clean and pack for me. :c
So much cleaning and packing to do before I leave for El Paso. Kill me now.
My head is killing me.
The Help makes me cry every single time. I'm too weak for this movie.
Oh. Okay.
I can't wait to go hooooome. I miss hanging out with everyone. Three more days. :(
Hugs are so fucking awkward. .-.
Good news: I found the bathroom.
Guess I could just talk to my sister.
I'm so booooored. I hardly know anyone at this birthday party. AND NO ONE'S TEXTING ME SO I CAN'T LOOK OCCUPIED.
Oh my gosh. You can be such a little fucking baby sometimes.
TUESDAY NEEDS TO HURRY THE FUCK UP.
Ahhhh feels good to finally be in bed. This must be what heaven's like.
Grades won't be finalized till Monday. FUUUUUUUUUUCK me. I just wanna know if I passed math or not. :(
Done with finals. Done with school. Celebrating with sushi tonight. <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>

@JoshVallez and I'm eating your cookies while doing it too. B)
@JoshVallez too late, already bombing you to shreds.
Wish I had the whole week off. :c
@JoshVallez Well shit. Sorry I'm never good enough!
@JoshVallez I always knew you were a crackhead.
@JoshVallez IS THAT WHAT YOUR MOTHER TELLS YOU AT BEDTIME TO HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER?
@JoshVallez just for that split second though.
Worst part is I know some part of you actually meant it. And you don't even feel bad.
@JoshVallez oh my gosh. I don't know whether to applaud you or laugh for turning an insult into an oddly working compliment. x)
Just feeling all degrees of shitty tonight. Awesome.
@JoshVallez HAHAHAHAAHAAHAAH YOUR ASS IS A JOKE.
I honestly have no idea why people come to me about relationships. I can't even hold onto one in my own life.
@JoshVallez I would.. BUT YOU'RE HOGGING ALL THE SPACE WITH YOUR FAT ASS
@JoshVallez fite me u won't pencilhead
@JoshVallez why yes, I am happy! Thank you for noticing. :D
@JoshVallez That's unfortunate. SUCKS TO SUCK.
Trying so fucking hard to not let your words eat me up inside.
@JoshVallez I like American movies! Some of my best friends watch American movies!
@JoshVallez more like BOOOOOOOORRRIINNGGGGG
@JoshVallez is that from Indiana Jones? x)
I really do wish I could get an apartment with Sarah. That'd be so much fucking fun. :(
Shit.
100% shitty.
What a shit night. Real shitty night.
I don't even know what to think right now. Probably the most hurtful thing you've EVER told me.
I can't believe you just said all that. That hurt so fucking much.
Wow. Wow okay. No, that's fine. I totally don't mind you just ripping my heart out like that.
I don't even have any energy to shower.

If my sister asks me if I need water when I cough one more time, I'm going to snap her like a twig. I'M NOT CHOKING I JUST HAVE A COUGH.
Thought my cough was finally passing. Boy was I wrong.
I wish I could go home for Thanksgiving. :(
I have a feeling I'm going to fail my literature class again. Oops.
I fucking hate waiting for my papers to be graded. I want to know how I did NOW.
Oh. Okay.

@JoshVallez she thought she saw a bag of cocaine at the bottom but it turned out to be a hallucination caused by her cocaine withdrawal.
@JoshVallez no, not really. x) okay okay! Why did the teacher jump into the pool?
@JoshVallez want to hear a terrible joke?
Having my room on the second floor is literally the worst thing ever because I drop EVERYTHING.
Lmfaoooo x) our ADOPTED children can be besties. <BABY><BABY>
@JoshVallez woooooow this is 2014, you can't say bromosexual.

Yup, definitely pregnant. We're baby bump buddies!

Not really. Boys don't like me. :-)
lol actually am pregnant..
Wtf when is my period going to start? ._.
@JoshVallez O.

@JoshVallez you've never really heard that song? .---.
@JoshVallez THAT'S A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT.
@JoshVallez XDDDDDD that one song. You knowww. Everyone knows it. x)
@JoshVallez I REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED TO BE NICE. THE DANCING QUEEN, YOUNG AND SWEET, ONLY SEVENTEEN.
@JoshVallez I'm only a few months older actually. x)

"@JoshVallez: This month I turn 19 which is a totally insignificant age but it's cool so whatevs." Baby x)

I CAN'T BREATHE
@werah4 the kind you find in your spice cabinets and tell middle schoolers it's something else. x)

Where's @werah4 when I need her to take care of me? <WEARY FACE>
Oh my goooooooosh. Someone come make me soup or something. Take care of me. I'm dying. I feel like shit. :(
"@werah4: "@sleepycoyotee: "@werah4: I want hot chocolate from I hop or village inn <DISAPPOINTED FACE>" let's go!" Chut up <UNAMUSED FACE>" wow rude going w/out joo
I have felt dizzy and nauseous ALL day.

lol pregnant..
"@werah4: I want hot chocolate from I hop or village inn <DISAPPOINTED FACE>" let's go!
@werah4 always and forever♡
I'm such a shitty friend. I'm surprised everyone has stuck around for as long as they have.
Someone save me from homework.
I fucking hate feeling homesick.
Love dressing for cold weather.♡
I just want to curl up and die.
My head hurts so much. :'(((((
Sarah should come have lunch with me everyday here. Just saying.
@werah4 awh sarah!!!!!! Yeah if it was that bad then that's good you dropped it. D;
@werah4 you did???? :O I'm pretty sure it's too late to drop my classes. .-.
My whole life is on that thing. :(((((((
WHERE IS MY USB
@werah4 I'll drop out if you drop out :-)
@werah4 just this semester and I'll be good. T^T
My head hurts so much. Pretty sure it's all that French homework.
Ready to pass the fuck out.
I left my phone charger downstairs. I want to go get it but I don't want the dogs barking. :(((((
I'm just going to keep watching GoT until the new season starts. <OK HAND SIGN>
My ankles hurt SO much. I really want to chop them off right now.
All this French is making me want to cry.
Should I cut my hair? Should I keep it long? I can't decide. :ccccccc
@werah4 well I don't even have an apartment yet so it's okay. There's time. x)
WHAT A RELIEF. I thought my math homework was due tomorrow but it's due Tuesday. :')))))))))
@werah4 just work here. There's TONS of baby places here. x)
Still waiting on Sarah to come live with me. I know she's gonna give in eventually.
@werah4 or you could just come here and live with me and go to shows!!!!
I've been doing homework ALL day. I've never done this before. What is happening? Who am I? Kill me.
@werah4 if I fail, that's it. I'm done. I'm gonna have to change majors. x)
I'm just wasting time. ._.
Thanks a lot daaaad. You just had to be white.
If there's one thing I genuinely hate and suck at, it's math. My Asian genes failed me.
I just keep staring at my laptop screen hoping, praying, wishing my math homework will solve itself.
@JoshVallez currently <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
math gods give me strength pls
I hate football season. I hate any sport season in general. But I hate football the most.
Done with French homework. Now I just need to do math. I GOT THIS.
I don't understand how my sister and I are siblings when we are such opposites. It just doesn't make sense. .-.
I'm so tired but I don't want to sleep. .-.
The hand eyes dude is my favorite. :')
@JoshVallez yup so wide a few korean movies are even included. :3
@JoshVallez I love a wide variety of movies. :D
@JoshVallez but I really do love that movie. x)
@JoshVallez I love that movie!!
You know what, Josh? You're just a sourpuss.
Oh wow, Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot better the second time.

Not really.
I just wanna sleep but there's so much homework to do. :(
Have I died and gone to hell already?
It's so hot. I'm going to burn in my sleep.
@JoshVallez .................that's my night cap.............
@JoshVallez BUT I'M NOT. MAYBE YOU ARE. GOODNESS GRACIOUS.
@JoshVallez but what if your research is wrong? x)
@JoshVallez that sounds very sketchy. .-.
My nose burns. DDDDDDDD;;;;;;;;;;
TOO MUCH WASABI HOOOOOLY FUCKING SHIT.
@JoshVallez pretty sure you're more than capable of making one. x)
@JoshVallez ooooooohhhhh x) duh we can play over skype! :D
@JoshVallez oh you have to play in person? x)
"@JoshVallez: I really want to start playing dungeons &amp; dragons but I need people to play with." I volunteer as tribute!
It's too early to be up.
"@werah4: I miss my friends" I miss you too :(&lt;3
Can't find my calculator. I'll never become a doctor.
It's so fucking hot in this room. I just wanna sleep. :(
Oh great, my sister wants to go watch Guardians of the Galaxy tomorrow. Kill me now.
Whoever said "college is the best 4 years of your life" can go shove my debt up their ass.
I can't find my pants. .______.
I don't want to do homework. :c
It's so fucking hot.
You knew I was having a shit day and yet you CHOSE to be mean. K. Fuck you too.
I need to leave NOW. Is my sister seriously going to make me wait for breakfast? She's just like my mom. I don't have to eat, you know. -.-
Soooo, when is it going to get cold so I can bury myself under blankets without getting a heat stroke?
Always something missing.
I feel like crying.
Hate doing laundry. Hate doing any housework really.
I really, REALLY want mac and cheese.
I never did laundry today. Oops.
Lol am a criminal now.
@cee_elloo awhh Cielo, don't worry. Dentists are never cute. x)
@cee_elloo 10 months. That's gonna be some serious pain. .-.
Just because you move your hips doesn't mean that you exist.
cryin for Cielo rn.
@JoshVallez HEY YOU FORGOT YOUR PACKED LUNCH SILLY FRENNNN!
@JoshVallez OKAY BUT I'LL MISS U BEST FRANNNN HAHAHAHAH COME BACK SOON
@JoshVallez OMG I HEART U TOOOOO BEST FRANZ 4EVRRRRR AND EVR AND EVR
@JoshVallez I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS ACTUALLY SO YEAH.
@JoshVallez IT'S BETTER AND THAT'S THAT. Actually I really don't know. I've never seen Princess Mononoke. x)
@CrownTheMichael nahh too basic. x)
@CrownTheMichael lmfao what else would I use? x)
Okay, let's all just not text Aimy back at the same time. &gt;_&gt;
@CrownTheMichael hahahahah idk it was pretty terrifying. I was all panicking because I had left fingerprints. x)
@JoshVallez SPIRITED AWAY &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Still can't believe I dreamt I stabbed a man in the neck with a chopstick. Of all things a CHOPSTICK. Of course I would have one on me.
Kinda bored. Kinda want to play around with eyeliner.
Reminded yet AGAIN why I don't do relationships. Lol 2 messy and complicated 4 me.
We all know you secretly want to be me. :-)
Hahahahahahahahahah Josh "hates" me. Yeah, okay. Sure thing, buddy.
I swear everytime I'm about to go to bed at least one person tries talking to me. Without fail. Just stfu and let me sleep.
I want to go back home. I miss everyone.
Honestly just tired of everything. Nothing is exciting anymore.
:(
I don't feel good at all today.
I send the most unflattering snapchats. x))))))))
In desperate need of a long and very relaxing shoulder massage.
Have to wait 3 hours for my sister's class to get out. Guess I'll do homework. Or procrastinate and call my mom like the little baby I am.
Somebody do my homework for me. Please. I will repay with food.
I've been getting up like 30 minutes before I have to leave. That's not good.
Wish the storm would come to Dallas. It's fucking hot as Satan's ass crack here.
I have a feeling I won't make any friends this year too.
Hate driving to school so much. Tooooooooo much traffic. :(
People who text without faces piss me the fuck off. WHY ARE YOU SO EMOTIONLESS.
I keep having rape dreams. It's a sign.
It's too hot to do anything.
I took traffic in El Paso for granted.
But of course traffic was a bitch.
Second day wasn't so baaaaad, only had one class.
School drains me so much. It's ridiculous.
Wow it's only been the first day and I can already feel the depression coming.
Love how my hair smells after a shower.&lt;3333333
Dead. I need a nap.
I don't wanna get out of bed. :(
Ughhhhhh. I'm so tired. First days suck.
Tomorrow morning is gonna suck dicks. Know why? DALLAS TRAFFIC.
Wow, Darion finally added me on snapchat after like 15 years. Ok.
I was super tired earlier but now I'm too nervous to sleep. ._.
Sarah can dress up for me any day.
@JoshVallez IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT JOSHUWUUUUUUH
@JoshVallez WHICH OUTFIT THOUGH OMG
Come dress me!!!! :(
@JoshVallez OBVIOUSLY BUT WHICH ONES?
I'll probably just stick to jeans and a t-shirt. Idk how to look pretty.
I need more skirts.
Kinda wanna wear a dress, kinda don't.
@JoshVallez -_____________- BUT WHAT
I have no idea what to wear tomorrow. :(
@werah4 you just need a nice guy who's rough in bed!
@werah4 probably is but whatever, he's hot. x)
@werah4 idk but he hawt :-)
@werah4 let him show you a good time 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahah. 
@joshuabeltran12 <SHORTCAKE>
@Aye_Goon truuuuuue
I have nothing to dooooooooo. No one's even texting me. No one ever texts me. :(
So how much longer till I turn into a tree?
Sick and tired of breathing.
Sick and tired of feelings.
Sick and tired of college.
Sick and tired of job applications.
I still can't get over the fact that my dad sent me a video of himself smoking hookah. Like wtf, Charles? x)
@JoshVallez LIME IS DISGUSTING. I CANNOT BE CONVINCED OTHERWISE.
@JoshVallez doubtful. Very doubtful. x)
"@JoshVallez: I'm making Lime cookies because I like to live dangerously." That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of.
Sometimes I get lonely then I see others in relationships and remember why I don't get attached to people. Fuck that.
I miss you too. &lt;/3
You're never even on skype!!
Nigga. If you're gonna tell me to get on skype, fucking answer when I call. -.-
"@werah4: "@sleepycoyotee: I need to hurry up and get my own place with Sarah ."" TRUUE. But Sarah doesn't love me so she won't come here.
I need to hurry up and get my own place.
My aunt is fucking crazy. I can't deal with neat freaks. I just can't.
"@werah4: I can think of so many places I'd rather be than church" like MY bed. :-)
Wow rude. I know Sarah totally wants my D.
@werah4 shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
@werah4 bitch, you're the one who loves me
I retweet Sarah but don't talk to her to keep her guessing if I want her or not.
Oh my gosh. I can't even eat in my room. Fuck this house.
"@joshuabeltran12: I'm sure everyone on twitter knows exactly when Aimy gets her period #ew" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH true.
Mine and Sarah's periods are always in sync. We're probably gonna have our babies at the same time too.
Somebody go get me more tampons. Please. I can't because I'm too lazy.
This flight looks like it'll nearly be empty. YESSSSSS. I'll probably be able to get a window seat. :')
I would start my period before I have to leave for the airport.
UGHHHHHHHHHHHH I can't believe I'm already leaving.
I've been too tired to cry. Everything will probably pour out tonight when I'm trying to sleep.
Hate saying goodbye.
Going out for dinner for the last time before I leave. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Wah. Can't believe it's already my last day. :(
Well, shit. Not really the best news to wake up to.
I just realized it's past 12. It's officially my last day. BRB CRYIN. And doing laundry.
Circa Survive is coming to Dallas in December. SUPER STOKED.
WHY DOES MY CAT INSIST ON LYING ON MY PILLOW
I forgot to put strong. I meant strong enough. Whatever. It's two in the morning.
I need to pee but that requires getting up and I'm not sure I'm enough for that.
Anakin, you little shit.
@werah4 yup I like it rough
Had a dream last night that I met a guy but he turned super aggressive and beat me up. Okay.
@JoshVallez just the way the dude talks makes me cringe. ._.
@JoshVallez HOW DUMB.
Wait, is this what the prequels are about? All this love story bullshit?
@JoshVallez OR YOU'RE JUST SATAN.
@JoshVallez THEY PRETTY MUCH ARE.
@JoshVallez I don't knowwww, I have a feeling the old ones will be pretty cheesy. x)
The second Star Wars isn't THAT bad so far.
@JoshVallez impossible.
Am I the only one who thinks Guardians of the Galaxy was just an alright movie?
So, uh, is it too early to call in sick for the school year?
Haven't even looked at what books I need.
Going to be sad for the next three days.
Wish this summer didn't have to end.
Leaving on Wednesday. :(
@werah4 
@werah4 so picky x) I want chinese!!!!
@werah4 I thought you were already eating wtf x)
@werah4 hurry up!!!
I hate planning shit.
Seriously don't get why people have to make things so complicated when it really doesn't have to be.
Soooooo tired. I'm just gonna sleep till it's time to go bowling.
I don't want to get up. :(
@werah4 nah, I'm going to look like a slob. Too tired to look pretty. x)
@werah4 no!!!!!
OW. Just hit my head really hard on the kitchen counter. Send help.
No one wants to have a bonfire. Brb cryin.
Can it stop raining for even at least a day? I JUST WANNA HAVE A BONFIRE DAMMIT.
"@werah4: "@sleepycoyotee: Rice makes everything better."oh, oh Aimy how'd you get so asian" I have my birth recorded, you can watch B)
Rice makes everything better.
I owe 5,914.60 for ONE semester. Kill me now.
Lately I've been waking up in some weird positions. Maybe that's why my body is so sore.
Blind as a bat right now.
I can't find my glasses and I reeeeally can't see without them. ._.
It's amazing how such a nice day can turn into complete and utter shit.
Worst phone call of my life. That just made things 1000x worse.
@CottonCandyPlip thank you♡
This fucking sucks. And my best friend won't even talk to me. That's cool. Leaving is going to be so much harder this time.
I seriously can't stop crying. It just hit me today that I've reached the single digits until the day I leave.
Way to just put a damper on things and make my night all sad.
Ughhhhh I ate too much. My stomach is in so much discomfort. :(
All my mom wants me for is to take her on beer runs.
Do I want more food or sleep?
But it was alright. x)
I'M FUCKING STARVING OH MY GOSH
How am I supposed to finish getting ready with my cat being all cute and trying to cuddle?
Just waiting for the year I finally become hot.
It's summer!!!!! Doesn't matter what day it is!!!!
@werah4 
@werah4 
Sarah hates me. She doesn't want to go build a fire in the desert and burn babies with me.
I just really, really want something sweet.
Someone get me sweets.
I need sweets.
I'm craving sweets.
My hair is so soft but no one plays with it and that makes me very sad.
No, that's cool. Not like I was gonna have a bonfire or anything tonight.
Everyone just fucking dies in this show. I'm so done.
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
I just wanna lie in bed naked all day.
I seriously need to get my own car.
THIS SHOW IS SO FUCKED UP OH MY GOSH
You're a little fucker, aren't ya?
Wish I had bigger eyes.
@JoshVallez noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo don't say that. :'c
@JoshVallez well, what a pleasant morning surprise. x)
@JoshVallez wtf Joffrey DOES die. You made me think he doesn't. x)
That's going to be stuck in my head ALL day now. I just know it.
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one. <VICTORY HAND>
Too early to be up. BUT, I must be a dutiful daughter and take my dad to the airport.
Last night was sooooo much fun.
"@JoshVallez: I know I'm going to regret it but I'm seeing the teenage mutant ninja piece of shit movie later so yeah." Gross
@joshuabeltran12 not you x))
You've really been pissing me off lately. Holy fuck.
I should probably get out of bed and get ready now.
I just want a body like Shay Mitchell's. <PENSIVE FACE>
Breakfast in bed would be super nice right now.
That was super awkward.
Living in the desert definitely has its perks.
@JoshVallez TRUUUUUUU #needasugardaddy
Not caring about Rene since 2012 B)
@JoshVallez it's so stupid. x))))))
@JoshVallez WHY NOT WATCH IT ALL DAY EVERYDAY THEN BC SUMMER
That reminds me, the other day on Syfy I saw like the first ten minutes of sharktopus and it was just too ridiculous. Syfy cracks me up.
@JoshVallez WELL THEN LET'S GO
@Trailortrashh too lazy to spell all that out
@JoshVallez it's that good? x)
@JoshVallez could've been strong enough already but you know, SIQ INVITE
@JoshVallez ugh. I need a break. That was too much for my little heart to handle. .-.
@JoshVallez ALSO SOMEONE BETTER KILL JOFFREY SOON SUCH A PRICK
@JoshVallez BRB MOURNING BC ASSHOLES
@Trailortrashh not the guy, the actual wolf. u.u
@JoshVallez they couldn't have just left the wolf alone? T^T
@JoshVallez They killed the wolf. :'((((((((((((((
._____________. wut
@JoshVallez WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
@JoshVallez no I just started. I had to clean. x)
That pisses me off so much. Why the fuck would anyone think it's okay to bring such a deadly virus into the country?
I hope everyone knows we're all going to die of ebola.
@JoshVallez that means something happens. x)
@JoshVallez why? Is something going to happen? x)
@JoshVallez I'm starting episode 9 of season 3. o:
I'm almost done with GoT. I'M GOING TO HAVE A PANIC ATTACK.
Hey! I just noticed Sarah doesn't look naked in her profile picture for once.
Ahahahahahahahahahah Sarah has to be a teacher.
So excited for Sarah that she got the job she wanted! Hope it brings her copious amounts of happiness.♡
I just almost died from choking on my spit. Oh my gosh. That was horrible.
"@_briiii4: This Is Why I Only Talk To My Boyfriend." *cat
@JoshVallez MAYBE I WANTED TO BOND N SHIT WITH YOUR MOM TOO
"@JoshVallez: Seeing Guardians for a second time at 8 and I'm stoked." SIQ INVITE
This is why I hate you.
Weeeeelll then download for me!
It's funny because I haven't seen Star Wars.
Love you too. <WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE>
Guardians of the Galaxy looks boring and stupid.
Wearing a dress today so I can feel good about myself and cheer up. <VICTORY HAND>
My dad probably thinks I'm fucking weird.
My dad found out I'm reading Fifty Shades. Awkwaaaard. It's like the time he found out I had sex all over again. Kill me now.
Really going to miss my cat when I leave. :'(
These people are so fucking needy. Like geez, get a grip on yourselves.
The second book of Fifty Shades is starting to get reeeeeally boring.
Can't believe I'm already leaving in less than three weeks. I don't want summer to end yet. :(
Nobody said you can't visit!!!!!!
"@werah4: "@sleepycoyotee: I'm just gonna stick to guy friends. Except Sarah. Sarah is bae." Same except Aimy's practically a guy so" TRUUUU
I'm just gonna stick to guy friends. Except Sarah. Sarah is bae.
"@werah4: "@beauknows: The stage is set... #LasVegas #CrowdSurfAmericaTour #HardRockCafe 
@werah4 it's 514 pages, is that long? x)
@werah4 do it!!!! I'm telling you, Christian Grey is the kind of guy you need. x)
Memow keeps calling for her babies. Stahp. You're making me cry. Your meows sound so sad. ;(
Not really, just pay for my college education. Don't even need fucking.
Geez, wish a guy would buy me a car and fuck me on it.
Fifty Shades of Grey is the weirdest book I have ever read. But I hate not finishing books so I'll just keep reading.
You better not flake out on me. Fucker. u.u
Sarah when her dad bosses her around. 
I'm never gonna get anything done because of Game of Thrones.
Feelings suck.
@JoshVallez 
I just want to hurry up and get my own place so I can finally take my cat. :c
@JoshVallez 
@JoshVallez good, good, very good. :-) DON'T FUCKING PLAY ME
@JoshVallez that IS small. Why would you watch it on your phone? x) NIGGA YOU BETTER NOT JUST BE SAYING THAT EITHER
@JoshVallez reallyyyyyyyy? :'DDDDDDDD
@JoshVallez YET. x)
@JoshVallez I can't!  I'm scurrd. D;
@JoshVallez I WON'T. That is until I have to leave. I'm watching it off my friend's computer. :c
"@werah4: I hate that I am so picky" THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE CHINESE
@JoshVallez I fucking looooooooove it. Better than breaking bad. x) I think I last saw episode 3 or 4, I can't remember. :o
Wish I could wake up to this weather everyday.
Just going to play Wind Waker for the rest of the night. <OK HAND SIGN>
Even though that's fucking bullshit. But whatever. I only have a few weeks left here and I intend on enjoying every last minute of it.
Not gonna let it bother me. Not gonna let it ruin the rest of my summer.
@Trailortrashh love you too Rene.
Okay, I've had enough of summer. It's so fucking hot.
@werah4 k
When is @werah4 gonna get her license so she can visit me in Dallas and take me on cool dates and just drive me around in general?
@werah4 
@werah4 you sure you want a guy roommate? x)
@werah4 
"@werah4: I wanna live in an apartment. There's like no point in having a house when you are never home" ayyeee roommate <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Poor Sarah. She never even got a chance.
I'm going to be a sarcastic cunt sometimes. I just am. If you take it personally, that's your problem.
I can't deal with super sensitive people. I just can't. Like seriously, there's no need to be such a baby over the smallest things.
My feet are so swollen. It hurts to walk. :(
@JoshVallez no. Vegas sucks. x)
@JoshVallez you'd love it. It plays nonstop here. u.u
That stupid song is stuck in my head now. :(
Pretty sure the whole time I've been in Vegas I've heard Don't Stop Believing at least three times.
Bae needs to hurry the fuck up.
@ritoburrito_ <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Can @werah4 take any longer to get here?
I can be such a little baby sometimes. It's so embarrassing.
I just don't know anymore. DDDDDDDDD:

I feel like I still smell like cat piss.
I just wanna go eat with my friends. :(
Well this isn't good. Thought my anxiety had gotten better.
I hate getting ready so much. It's such a chore.
Can my cat just take herself to the vet?
Really don't want to get out of bed.
Someone go with me to buy mac and cheese.
I want a midnight snack but idk what.
Really don't want to wake up early but the whore must go get fixed. :(
Wish I could take a bath every night.

I wanna go home but I also don't want to pack and get ready.
A better butt than Sarah's.
Having an upstairs bedroom now better give me a great butt.
I have no problem with being woken up at 5 in the morning by a thunderstorm.
My parents won't notice if I sneak away and hitch a ride back to El Paso before Thursday, right?
Sucks that I won't be home for the 4th of July. I was really looking forward to it this year.
I'm going to start taking better care of my body.
I'm so tired of packing. WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SHIT.
I don't mind moving but fuck, do I hate packing.
I just wanna sleep. I don't wanna pack up the apartment. :(
Driving kills my shoulder so much. .-.
My room is far from messy.
Because it's not.
@JoshVallez kys
I'm only going to be gone for a week but I'm packing outfits like I'm going to be gone for a month. IT'S JUST SO HARD TO CHOOSE.

Hate packing. And I still need to do laundry. Fuck me.
I have Sarah under babyprincess in my phone because that's what she is.

Today has been such a nice, chill day. I love it.
@JoshVallez that too. I DON'T CARE. u.u
Why does Twitter always notify me when someone retweets another person's tweet? I DON'T FUCKING CARE.
Can summer just never end?
Looking at my class schedule for the fall scares me.
So much to get done today but I just want to lie in bed. :(
"@werah4: I just wanna have fun. Nothing serious for now at least" bae I'm fun

Today's just a big fuck up.
These cramps are just a no no.
Who wants to go buy me chocolate because my vagina is bleeding out and it would make it 100x more bearable?
Hate periods. Hate 'em.
I don't want to do anything today except curl up and die.
My dad got me tampons. True love.

Bought a large coke so I could share it with Vergie and I think she only drank it like once throughout the whole movie. Fucker.

Tonight was just what I needed. Really missed going to shows with @werah4.
Rompers are all fun and cute till you have to pee really bad.
I hate feelings. Feelings suck. Why do they even exist? If I could just not have feelings, that'd be great.
"@jonnycraig4L: El Paso TX who's comin to the show tonight?" You know what'd be really, really cool? If you sang happy birthday to @werah4 !
I'm a mess.
"@werah4: Well today has started off horrible" but it'll end wonderful!
Got @werah4 her ticket for @SLAVESOFFICIAL tomorrow and hopefully @jonnycraig4L sings happy birthday to her!!!!!!!!!
It's toooooooo hoooooot.

Feelings are just visitors, let them come and go.
You never fail to be an asshole. Cool.

Don't wanna go to class. Don't wanna take the final. Kill me now.
Cool. Can I retire today?
Going to get a farm and fill it with a bunch of cute animals and let people come play and pet them and everyone will be fucking happy.
Figured out my retirement plan.
Don't wanna study for finals. Just wanna sleep sleep sleep.
Do I want to go red again or just keep my natural hair??????
Ugh, I feel so sick like I'm going to throw up. :(
@werah4 nigga I got finals!

My cousin probably thinks I'm like a bad influence on his kids now.
Chris Dillard, making things awkward since ever.
Idk why my sister's getting mad. Like bitch I'm not a fucking hair stylist. I don't know hair. I told you I didn't know what I was doing.
"@ritoburrito_: I got a party on the east side, hmu if you're trying to go. No drama, just good times." Ayyyyyy
Hope everyone has fun at prom. And breaks a nail.
Everyone's getting jobs and kids and married and becoming 30 in 19 year old bodies and I'm just here stuffing my face with bread.
"@werah4: This guy makes me so nervous" let him touch your butt
So tired. :(((((
On a side note, FUCK DOWNTOWN DALLAS. FUCK DALLAS IN GENERAL WITH ITS CONFUSING ASS ROADS.
Glad I went to go see DGD. Most fun I've had since I got here.
I'm scared to go. x)
@werah4 yeah yeah x)
You are, everything. My most, demanding dream.
Sarah is seeing DGD without me tonight. Low-key hate her.
Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
I can never make up my mind about my nail color. This is why I don't paint my nails. It's just too stressful.
Painted my nails "tidal wave" but not sure I like it.
IS IT MAY YET I WANT TO GO HOME
SO STOKED FOR DGD THIS WEEK
Happy birthday Hitler!
I actually have really good taste in clothes but my wallet won't let me show it.
It's been more than a fucking year and you still manage to get under my skin. I'm going to lose my mind.
I don't want to go to school. :'(
I hope @werah4 is being a good girl and doing her essay.
It's so cold. What the hell happened to spring???????????
@werah4 RAMEN OMG SARAH AFTER 5 YEARS YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW

"@werah4: I know I'm gonna have to finish this stupid essay, but I'll just wait till the last minute like usual" NO
Really hoping this summer doesn't turn to shit.
Three more weeks. YES.
Really don't want to go to class.
Went outside to see the moon and thought nope. Too cold. Fuck that.
Last night it was my head. Tonight it's my ankle. I need a new body.
Sooooo, like, did we fast forward to winter? WHY THE HELL IS IT SO COLD
So who wants to watch the eclipse together? Oh, no one because everyone is in fucking El Paso.
"@Aye_Goon: “@captainnaimy: I know you're gay for me.” So?" So I know.

I can't believe we don't have ANY painkillers.
Just heard someone run past my window. Could you pick up a bottle of Tylenol while you're at it?
I'm not even tired. I'm just in pain.
It hurts so much. I can't take it.
Make it go awayyyyyyy.
This is seriously the worst headache I have ever had. I can't even sleep because it hurts so much.
This headache is killing me bye
Some days they feel like dress rehearsal. Some days I watch and you don't care.
I'm thinking about how much I need you but you really want somebody else.
So much to do but I just feel like shit. I don't want to do anything.

Love how there are so many cute little eateries here. Denton is such a cute little town.
La Dispute's new album is so fucking good. Hits me right down to the core.
@JoshVallez

Seriously hate how fucking emotional I get on my periods. Everything I keep bottled and buried just comes crashing through me all at once.
Fuck cramps. Fuck periods. Bye.

On a side note, I turn 19 tomorrow. Preparing for the most uneventful birthday/year.
Always waiting.
Waiting, waiting, waiting for it to stop hurting.
Two years and I've still got you under my skin.
Hate when we hang up at night. Feels so foreign and odd.
Is it summer yet? Definitely warm enough to be.
Cold without the jacket. Hot with the jacket. The struggle is unbearable.
Baby girl, twist away.
Studying for the French exam isn't going so well.. Ughhhhhhhh should've just taken sign language.
Skyping with my dad makes me miss him so much. :c
Seriously need to start going to bed earlier.
Oops, slept through my alarm. Guess no statistics for me today.
Sooooo many appointments to schedule. Lol let me just turn 15 again so my dad can take care of all that.
Someone just go to college for me.
Someone do ALL of my homework for me.
Ugh. Someone do my French homework for me.
Kind of feel bad now. Maybe I should've given that guy some money. He looked SO sad.
Not that I was any good.

Completely forgot to study for the statistics exam today. :((((((((
I just wanna hear you say "You got me, baby, are you mine?"
I have really high hopes for this summer to be a good one.
Can I skip my first class? Ugh.

"@werah4: Just cuz it's in China doesn't mean you have it. racist x)" LMFAO XDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!

My heart is like in a million pieces right now. That movie. Wow.
Ughhhhhhhh why did nobody tell me Lone Survivor is depressing as shit?

One more month until spring break. Really? Didn't we just come back from Christmas break?
Is it just me or is this school year going by super fast?
Can my dad please take himself to the airport? It is way too early to be up especially when I don't have school today.
On a side note, almost died on the highway. Starting to reeeeeally miss el paso's winter.
Ugh, finally home.
This town looks fucking eerie during the winter.
Freezing rain advisory right now. Hahahahahahahahah fuck that.

"@JoshVallez: No matter how many times I click "show me less of this" they never show me less of it." Hahahahah TRUUUUUUU
Wouldn't we be quite the pair?---you with your bad heart, me with my bad head.
Only made it worse if anything.
Nothing fills this empty hole inside me. Nothing. Moving did absolutely nothing.
@werah4 I want to so bad. :/
So tired of everything. I just want to go home. I miss my friends.
Tonight is turning into one of those nights where I just want to curl up and fucking bawl.
My legs are so sore. Someone massage them. :'(((((
I feel accomplished. c:
Going to the gym alone wasn't as bad as  I made it out to be.
Everything you do makes me miss you more.
Seriously, fuck it. I'm going to start going to shows even though I have no one to go with. Tired of missing out.
Dgd better come to dallas.
I'm too excited to sleep now.
Ugh. I picked THE worst time to fucking move.
Really? REALLY?! Why are all these shows happening AFTER I leave?
Sarah secretly wants to be a porn star.
I could be telling her I'm pregnant and I'd probably still use that face.
I've noticed Sarah and I text with x) pretty much all the time no matter what we say.
I WANT A FENNEC FOX SO BAD.

Pretty sure everyone in the library can hear my stomach.
Someone bring me foooood.
I'm so hungry but the cafe is all the way down the street and I am not about to go walk in the cold again. .-.
It should be illegal to have school when it's this cold.
@Shaaaggy_ nigga please 
@beltran_josh good idea!
Do I get up and eat breakfast or sleep in some more? Hmmmm.
Nineteen.. makes me cringe.
Ew I don't like that. Nineteen feels like such an ugly number.
