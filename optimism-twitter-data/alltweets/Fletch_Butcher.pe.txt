@jk_rowling @ricardopq wealthy English residents in having 5000x the influence as actual Scottish people. It's the problem with politics.
@jk_rowling @ricardopq my point is you're completely unrepresentative of Scottish people. But use your wealth to buy much more influence
@jk_rowling @ricardopq you've got vested interests in Scotland being joined at the hip with London after all.
@jk_rowling @ricardopq I'm not someone who gets particularly angry about politics. But I understand it.
@jk_rowling @ricardopq an English women, feeding money to English parties, to keep Scotland under control of the English.Bound to antagonise
@JamesERothwell politicians should take some responsibility for the toxic society they create. On purpose.
@JamesERothwell society always breaks down because of vindictive, greedy, hate filled Tory politics.
@wallaceme this is the hate filled broken society Tories always create. On purpose......
@wallaceme don't expect young angry people to show respect if the government continually attacks them
@wallaceme old people don't riot against the Tories as you stuff their pockets with money Alain.....you represent them and look after them
@Alain_Tolhurst why does it always happen with Tory governments......ask yourself that Alain
@Alain_Tolhurst Hopeless people do things like this. But you create the hopelessness out of spite, hate and pure greed.
@Alain_Tolhurst ruining young people's lives and futures and then taking no blame for the scummy society it creates is cowardly
@Alain_Tolhurst Tories drive people to this. Take some responsibility for the society you want
@SuperKarlOyston Karl hides behind minimum-wage paid OAPs......basically
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie DC going to need to build bridges with  Libs, Labour to get things through.
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie hilarious thing is Dave has no majority. His own party will vote against him!
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie not sure 5 years of tiny majority is worth handing Labour 15 years in power from 2020.
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie as like in 1992 the new Labour leader waits patiently for an easy 100+ majority.
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie enjoy the 12 months where your party isn't shambolically tearing itself apart basically
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie Tiny Tory majority built on negative campaign and deceipt is doomed to fail hilariously
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie During elections stooges like Michael and Ian write whatever lies CCHQ tell them to...
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie love it how Michael pretends the Telegraph are "free thinkers" in editorial control!
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie and yes Michael. Rags like yours print whatever lies CCHQ tell you to
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie scaring Libs to vote for you with lies, is a mandate that will last about 3 months....
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie But when Tory government implodes into a hilarious ball of flames in 3 years......!
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie Let's all agree that whipping up Nationalism to win a few years in power is effective
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie a 6 majority......when 60 of your own MPs want you out. Hmmm.....!
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie long term it's obvious Cameron's government will go down in a hilarious ball of flames!
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie lying about Scots to scare Lib Dems into backing you was very effective. Short term
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie I don't anyone thinks the press think for themselves....! Just party political tools
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie well it's more blaming the Tory party for telling the press to lie to voters
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie Michael. Tory majorities of 6 don't end well. I think even you know that
@MichaelPDeacon @mrianleslie The entire Tory strategy was using the media to lie about the SNP and scare voters into backing them....!
@MichaelPDeacon @mrianleslie  this is what's known as "enjoying the moment" before The Tory Party tears itself apart over next few years
@MichaelPDeacon @robcmorgan @Grabcocque @mrianleslie come on. Using the press to lie to voters about the SNP was the entire strategy!
@David_Cameron Osborne has been booted out! yay
@rosaltmann don't the Tories already throw money at older people? How much more can they throw?!
@DPMcBride remember, Cameron had a pretty loyal majority of 71 with Clegg. That's now a majority of 15, if you include DUP.
@DPMcBride and people will be so fed up of the Tory bickering and in fighting, over that they'll vote them out for 15 years
@DPMcBride probably finishing with a Cameron resignation, or confidence vote some time in 2018.
@DPMcBride it will be a weak government, pandering to the Tory back benches to stay in power. Endless bickering and in fighting
@DPMcBride Cameron has at least 50 enemies on the back benches who will want him out sooner or later. I'd expect a leadership challenge
@DPMcBride anyone who thinks a Tory government with a majority of 6, isn't going to be completely shambolic. Well you're crazy
@conorspackman @DPMcBride If Cameron doesn't do exactly what the backbenches want, they'll get him out
@conorspackman @DPMcBride Austerity, EU dominated parliament with a majority of 6..........hmmmm!
@conorspackman @DPMcBride more the general theory that Tories destroy their own party, if they have a majority under 50.
@Harryinreview @DPMcBride will be so much in-fighting, back stabbing, leadership toppling, shambolism, they'll be out for 15 years .
@Harryinreview @DPMcBride The Tories couldn't run a stable government if they had a majority of 46. Let alone 6!
@RKWinvisibleman @robertshrimsley @DPMcBride Majority of 6? With 50 enemies on the back benches? What makes you think Cameron will survive?
@neilwallis1 @DPMcBride you're just going to see in-fighting, squabbling, messy, Major-esque government that everyone hates
@neilwallis1 @DPMcBride how on earth do the Tories govern, with such a small majority. Cameron has at least 50 enemies on the back benches!
@neilwallis1 @DPMcBride no logical, sane person can think that a Conservative government, with a majority of 5, is going to end very well!
@BBCBreaking if you have a wild imagination, corruption within polling could be used to fix betting/financial markets for example
@BBCBreaking it's a lot more serious than people think. Lot's of quite legal gambling, and financial transactions happen because of polling
@JoeMurphyLondon @David_Cameron @NicolaSturgeon SNP want the Tories there. Guarantees their dominance in Scotland
@JoeMurphyLondon @David_Cameron @NicolaSturgeon Tories tactic was to help SNP win and SNPs tactic was to help Tories win.....
@DeborahJaneOrr @JoeMurphyLondon yes. Its not been Tories abusing Scots for the last month has it....
@JoeMurphyLondon @David_Cameron @NicolaSturgeon Cameron got the SNP elected and the SNP got Cameron elected. The unholy alliance
@JoeMurphyLondon @David_Cameron @NicolaSturgeon errr they wanted the Tories to win Joe! That was their intention
@richard_burn15 @benrileysmith Osborne toxic. Like Gove. Would Tories have won with Gove still in education? No.
@benrileysmith That's a slap in the face for Osborne. But a achievable, coherent economic policy would have won them a 100 majority
@Steven_Swinford Cameron should resign as well. So he can leave on a high. Rather than pushed out by his backbenchers
@Steven_Swinford I think we can all agree that a 5 seat Tory majority is going to lead to one of the most shambolic parliaments since Major!
@Steven_Swinford Tories had a 71 majority with Clegg. Now have a 15 majority with DUP? How is this good for anyone!
@Steven_Swinford voters don't like being duped by dirty, negative campaigns. England may react in a similar way to Scots after Indy ref.
@Steven_Swinford we've been here before....1992....a nice short term success before the party ripe itself to pieces
@Steven_Swinford Steve. Tories can't govern with 15 seat majority. They need at least 50! Cameron won't last that long in office
@Steven_Swinford You mean lying and misleading people to get a 6 seat majority that ultimately puts Tories in opposition for 15 years?
@MatthewdAncona @ChukaUmunna I think any of these leaders would win easily in 2015. Theyre lucky. The Tory party will be a complete mess
@MatthewdAncona @ChukaUmunna with such a small mandate and austerity, EU to come we can assume it's going to be a shambolic parliament
@MatthewdAncona @ChukaUmunna let's face it. With a 10-15 majority I'll be pretty surprised if Cameron is still there in 2 years.....!
@_a_y @MatthewdAncona @ChukaUmunna don't agree. Different league to Cameron/Osborne as an intellect. And very engaging guy
@jazziz2 @nolesfan2011 @Messina2012 we often just elect parties on small issues. Parties generally have similar policies on big issues
@jazziz2 @nolesfan2011 @Messina2012 UK is not as divided/tribal as US. Most people broadly agree on the big issues here.
@jazziz2 @nolesfan2011 @Messina2012 put it this way. Obama is considerably more Conservative than the UK Conservative Party!
@jazziz2 @nolesfan2011 @Messina2012 UK elections are "the quite socialist party" vs " the very socialist party" basically!
@jazziz2 @nolesfan2011 @Messina2012 there are no right wing parties in the UK. Liberals and Conservatives here are similar. Very moderate
@Messina2012 the minute Cameron steps out of line with the right wing back bench, they'll push him out
@Messina2012 With 330 seats I doubt Cameron will last 3 years. There are 90 backbenchers who have already set his resignation date.
@Messina2012 and Tories were very lucky that Lib Dems were ruined by coalition. Tories picked up these seats almost by default
@Messina2012 Jim. We live in a country where we expect incumbents to have 100 seat majorities......both Tories and Labour were very poor
@Messina2012 does a 6 seat majority for an incumbent constitute a win?!
@nedsimons surely Tory backbenchers can kick Cameron out whenever they want? He's going to be at their mercy
@nedsimons Dave has gone from having 71 majority with Clegg to maybe 15 with the DUP? How is that a win?
@nedsimons I think you're the first pundit who actually gets it
@SimonMaresITV won too many seats for stable government. Tory backbenchers can get Cameron out very easily
@SimonMaresITV think Tories will prefer the 71 majority Clegg deal to a 6 majority solo deal!
@faisalislam Media glossing over the fact that Tories are in a much worse position now than in 2010.
@faisalislam you can't govern with majorities of 5-6.......you'll get kicked out pretty quickly
@faisalislam You know Tories have a majority of only 15. And that's with a DUP deal/support!
@DamianSurvation  Mythical "Tory Majority" polls you refused to publish!? Sound like backpeddling, weasel-words to me. Take it on the chin.
@Survation @DamianSurvation Survations weasel words, about mythical Tory Majority Polls they "refused to publish" are plain embarrassing
@ShippersUnbound you and I know, with a 15-20 majority we're about to see the most shambolic, toxic government since 1992.
@ShippersUnbound is Tories going from a 71 majority Lib Dem deal to a 15 majority DUP deal, a win for anyone? Even Cameron?
@ShippersUnbound Watching Tory Party absolutely implode, and tear itself apart over the next few years. Brand is going to have a field day
@ShippersUnbound Tim, I doubt a huge amount of Tory voters even wanted a Tory majority! Were probably voting for a Tory/Lib status quo
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg just don't see how Tories, on their own, with austerity, and EU, with 15 majority, won't be shambolic......
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg I fully expect to see leadership challenges against Cameron within 3 years, for one. Has no mandate as leader.
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg going to be interesting to see how long before Tories implode with only 15-20 majority. Couple of years?
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg funniest bit. Tories are going from a 71 majority with Clegg to maybe a 15 majority with DUP? Is that a win!?
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg You can absolutely guarantee Libs will elect anti-Tory, left wing leader now. And Tories will have no allies
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg Tories simply won too many seats. They needed Clegg and Libs to survive.
@LouiseMensch @nick_clegg Louise, you realize they're going to be the most anti-tory, left wing party in opposition from now on?
@SayeedaWarsi @nick_clegg how long do you think Cameron lasts with a majority of maybe 15, that relies on DUP? 2 years?
@Zaheerkhan_99 @SayeedaWarsi @nick_clegg Lib Dems will be very left wing, and anti Tory in next parliament. Clegg is not that type of leader
@Zaheerkhan_99 @SayeedaWarsi @nick_clegg survival of the Lib Dem Party...they need to go into opposition now. Clegg couldn't do that
@paulwaugh I suspect huge amounts of 2015 Tory voters, didn't even want a Tory majority for one! Wanted another Clegg/Dave coalition
@paulwaugh Just think it might be a decent one to lose. Like 1992. Tories with tiny majority are bound to be shambolic
@paulwaugh 30% of Tory MPs will be plotting as I type this, to force Cameron out in the medium term.
@paulwaugh If you think the Tories aren't going to implode, plot, and tear themselves apart with a 15 majority, you don't know politics!
@paulwaugh Tories had 71 majority with Libs. Now they have maybe a 15 majority with the DUP? How is this a good result for anyone!
@paulwaugh how long before we see Cameron's? 2017?
@ShippersUnbound I suspect there are plenty on the Tory benches who will want rid of Cameron and will take try and take the opportunity.
@ShippersUnbound Like 1992, Tories are surely going to tear themselves apart aren't they? 20ish majority, with EU on the table?
@ShippersUnbound Slightly perplexed how Tories think governing with a 15-20 majority with DUP, is better than a 71 majority with Lib Dems!
@ShippersUnbound When can we expect the Cameron resignation? 18 months?
@IsabelHardman Key to Tory Party having success in this climate, was having Lib Dem on their side. Political Cover. Cameron is history.
@IsabelHardman Tories taking on Libs, SNP, Labour, UKIP, with tiny majority and austerity? And EU vote? They're going to get destroyed.
@IsabelHardman Cameron would be better off with Libs holding 30 seats and winning no majority. Have them as allies, not enemies.
@IsabelHardman I can't think how anyone thinks next parliament is going to go very well. Even Tories!
@IsabelHardman think Clegg has a decent point. A 15-20 Tory majority, reliant on DUP, won through a negative, dishonest campaign?
@bbclaurak you'd think UKIP could batter Tories, with a tiny majority, over next 5 years
@bbclaurak he probably should come back. Tories will only have a 15 majority perhaps? And that's reliant on DUP.
@rowenamason Tories lost key votes with a 70+ coalition majority in last parliament! How many with 15-25?
@rowenamason going to be kinda fun watching them tear themselves apart again. Like in 1992.
@rowenamason Tories need at least 400 seats to govern! How many of their MPs support Cameron? Maybe 70%?
@Kevin_Maguire Cameron can't govern with such low numbers. The Tories are going to tear themselves apart over EU and Scotland.
@Kevin_Maguire Just, truly feel that Tories are setting Labour up for another 10-15 years of big wins again.
@Kevin_Maguire Voters are probably going to feel duped within 12 months. And Tories are going to be shambolic with 15-25 majority.
@Kevin_Maguire No Tory government can govern with a 15-25 majority. They're not disciplined enough. They'll lose various big votes
@Kevin_Maguire Let's be honest Kev. We're going to watch the Tories tear themselves apart for 5 years, before stepping in again. Like 1992
@LordAshcroft not sure even Tories are cynical enough to jerrymander the system, after winning tiny mandate!
@LordAshcroft basing seats on seat registration. Then also making it hard for minorities,young, poor to stay registered? Would be scandalous
@LordAshcroft Tories also want to make it as hard as possible to stay registered in seats. That's the problem here
@LordAshcroft Boundary changes can only be done fairly, if Tories also change system so people aren't disenfranchised.
@LordAshcroft wanting to base seats on registered voters. And also make it harder for voters to stay registered Richard? Scandalous
@glovelace @LordAshcroft come on Graham. Tories know the fewer MP, the greater the Jerrymander affect.
@glovelace @Martin_Hoscik @LordAshcroft more commonly known as jerrymandering
@LordAshcroft Scraping a small majority, then jerrymandering system? I don't think Tories have the mandate
@LordAshcroft Jerrymandering you mean?
@theobertram @LordAshcroft surely the tactic is to just watch Tories destroy themselves. And then step in? Like in 1992?
@theobertram @LordAshcroft with the party in-fighting you're going to see with Tories, I don't think Cameron will even be there in 3 years
@DominicFarrell @theobertram @philipjcowley @LordAshcroft I suspect tactic is to sit back and watch Tories tear themselves apart.
@DominicFarrell @theobertram @philipjcowley @LordAshcroft Tories are bound to implode. No way a tiny majority is governable. For them!
@DominicFarrell @theobertram @philipjcowley @LordAshcroft Have the Tories won since Ashcroft's analysis? a coalition, and a 5-6 majority?
@EmmaKennedy Tories will implode over EU. And various other things. Cameron is bound to have confidence challenged pretty quickly
@EmmaKennedy Tories governing with maybe a 20 majority? Surely it's a hollow victory! Cameron is history as well.
@redskinsfanuk @toadmeister @Ed_Miliband @GuidoFawkes it's going to be funny watching Tories disintegrate over Europe again!
@redskinsfanuk @toadmeister @Ed_Miliband @GuidoFawkes especially after winning with negative campaign. No real legitimacy
@redskinsfanuk @toadmeister @Ed_Miliband @GuidoFawkes don't think Tories realize theyre in a much worse position than 2010.....well Dave is
@redskinsfanuk @toadmeister @Ed_Miliband @GuidoFawkes going from coalition majority of 71 to maybe a DUP assisted 15 or 16?
@redskinsfanuk @toadmeister @Ed_Miliband @GuidoFawkes bets on how long before Tories rip themselves to pieces? 18 months?
@markorchard16 @toadmeister @MrHarryCole @Ed_Miliband we've been here before. 1992. Might be a good one to lose!
@markorchard16 @toadmeister @MrHarryCole @Ed_Miliband going from 71 coalition majority to maybe 16? With EU dominating?
@markorchard16 @toadmeister @MrHarryCole @Ed_Miliband bets on how long before Tories implode? 2 years?
@toadmeister @Ed_Miliband although watching Tories imploding, with no legitimacy and internal fighting will be pretty funny
@toadmeister @Ed_Miliband if you see how Scotland reacted to Tories dirty independence campaign. I'd expect something similar in England
@toadmeister @Ed_Miliband last minute confessionals won't work Toby. When voters realized they've been duped Tories are finished as well
@toadmeister @Ed_Miliband with Tories like yourself forcing him out with hate, fear mongering and negative campaigning.......?
@jameschappers when do you think Cameron leaves. Tiny majority party obsessed with Europe......2017?
@SpinningHugo @georgeeaton If Cameron survives 5 years. Pretty unlikely. I can't see Tories being in a pretty state either in 2020!
@SpinningHugo @georgeeaton the next government is going to be shambolic. With little legitimacy or popularity. Much like 1992.
@SpinningHugo @georgeeaton or watch Tories  implode, being attacked from all sides with Tiny majority and win easily regardless.
@georgeeaton Tories haven't won a governable majority in 25 years. Against Brown or Ed. They're hardly in great shape
@georgeeaton we've been here before. 1992. As much as I hate losing, watching Tories being attacked from all sides with tiny majority.....?
@georgeeaton errrr....George.....watch Tories implode over Eutope/UK with tiny majority and win next election easily I imagine.
@Barneyc123456 @robfordmancs great win for Cameron. Moving from a coalition majority of 71 to a coalition majority of 15. Doh....!
@Barneyc123456 @LabourList pick Cameron up in about 18 months. Majority of 15? They lost votes with coalition majority of 71!
@Barneyc123456 @LabourList going to be funny watching Cameron trying to govern with a majority of about 15. John Major part 2.....!
@Samuelsdale @Kevin_Maguire Tories and DUP isnt even a majority! Would be a knife edge vote even with their support
@roshbeth @Kevin_Maguire knife edge vote. Even with DUP
@Kevin_Maguire DUP not guaranteed to support referendum. They're conservative but quite anti referendum
@simonk133 @Kevin_Maguire haha. They're very anti referendum
@Kevin_Maguire not without Clegg.
@Kevin_Maguire would a Clegg-less Lib Dem party back the Tories? What on earth would they get from it?
@Me_Me_Me_2015 @Kevin_Maguire you think Cameron isn't a socialist. Bless.
@MSmithsonPB that's negative campaigning for you. Disillusionment. People stop caring
@ShippersUnbound I'd say you're crazy to think Westminster/UK will ever win the Scottish back. They're gone. Hearts and minds lost
@ShippersUnbound Tory/English press assault, to win election, has probably handed Scotland to SNP for next 15 years
@ShippersUnbound you don't understand Scots if you think they can be appeased by offers.
@JGForsyth English really need to accept that price of winning election is 15-20 years of SNP dominance and break up of union
@JGForsyth a bit delusional to think Scots are going to forgive Tories, Daily Mail, Telegraph and various other centre right institution
@JGForsyth No Tories north of Manchester.....58 nationalists in Scotland? Were in perilous times for our parliament
@dhb1987 @JGForsyth its a democracy James. Cameron isn't emporer. He'll have to respect will of Scottish people
@marklubienski @JGForsyth if you think Scots will forgive Tories/English press in the next 15 years you're crazy.
@JGForsyth do you think Scots will ever forgive Westminster/Tories? You're delusional
@JGForsyth all I'm saying is, you're probably looking at a lame duck PM. Enough votes to get in but not enough for Tory agenda.
@JGForsyth what I'm saying is how is Cameron winning? He's going to be massively weakened from 2010
@JGForsyth didn't Clegg/Cameron have a 71 majority at last election. Now Clegg gone as leader. And maybe 20 majority with Libs and DUP?
@ShippersUnbound Camerons going to come out of this massively weakened. With no obvious stable government
@ShippersUnbound also remember Clegg is history as leader. Will Libs want anything to do with voting with Tories?
@ShippersUnbound Goverment majority could be Tories relying on DUP, Libs. And maybe having only 25 more than opposition?
@ShippersUnbound you can win, but also lose. Cameron going to have nowhere near the votes at his disposal that he had in last parliament
@ShippersUnbound Tim, to state obvious. Clegg/Cameron had a 71 majority. Now you're getting excited about a majority gov of 25ish?
@GregBarkerUK @ShippersUnbound @George_Osborne winning withnegative campaigning. Leaves a government with no legitimacy. People get angry
@GregBarkerUK @ShippersUnbound @George_Osborne you'll probably see 15 years of Labour majorities when this one is done
@GregBarkerUK @ShippersUnbound @George_Osborne parties who lie, mislead and scare their way in, get obliterated eventually.
@GregBarkerUK @ShippersUnbound @George_Osborne come on. Vindication of dishonest, negative campaigning that will come back to haunt them
@TKViews @Ed_Miliband you can win, but still lose buddy.....
@TKViews @Ed_Miliband funny thing is you had a coalition majority of 71. Now it could be a 3 party coalition with only majority of 15!
@TKViews @Ed_Miliband how long do you think Cameron will last with a majority of 15 that relies on Lib Dems and DUP mate?!
@gphb @MSmithsonPB @drjennings newspapers follow public mood. They don't create it. They're very good at sensing what's going on.
@gphb @MSmithsonPB @drjennings newspapers didn't influence 1992 result. Myth. As is the claim that newspapers influenced this one
@AbiolaHP @TKViews @MSmithsonPB @drjennings are you dense? Mike reports polls. He doesn't create them
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB Assuming the exit is broadly right, do you see a majority Tories can govern with?
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB could well see new Lib leadership putting Libs in opposition again, even
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB also lose Clegg and Alexander from leadership. Will Libs want to vote through Tory policies now?
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB well they had a 71 majority with Libs. What in 2015? Maybe 15 or 20 max?
@MSmithsonPB why on earth would Lib Dems vote through Tory policies?
@MSmithsonPB you're going to call me crazy but even assuming exit poll is right I struggle to see how Cameron cobbles together majority?
@MSmithsonPB would a new LD leader back Tories? What an earth would they get from it
@robbo555 @MSmithsonPB he'll be gone. Bound to lose a confidence vote. Best case scenario is he maybe cobbles together majority of 20!
@AndrewRalph7 @MSmithsonPB @CllrRWillis the exit poll was miles off in 1992 as well you know!
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB you can win, but also lose in elections. Tories don't want Libs on 10 seats. They may want to join opposition
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB still think Tories have quite a job getting majority even if exit poll is exactly right
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB Clegg is guaranteed to resign if exit poll is right. So will Libs even want to go with Tories again
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB Tory government had a 71 majority with Libs. Now going to be 15 or so at best....
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB realize the Tories best possible majority using the exit poll is about13! That relies on Libs and DUP backing.
@paulwaugh I don't agree. Just shows exit poll is gibberish
@philipjcowley @georgeeaton Green is a decent signifier. I don't expect green to get very close in either seat
@philipjcowley @georgeeaton people need to remember, 5 large parties in an election? Exit polling like this never been attempted
@Yoona939 @georgeeaton would take a large Green swing to take Bristol. They were 10%+ behind only 3 weeks ago
@Yoona939 @georgeeaton but if I'm wrong, and Greens win, or even push Labour close in Bristol then they look more legitimate
@Yoona939 @georgeeaton Its a good signifier. If Greens not close in either, BEEBs numbers could start looking shaky
@Yoona939 @georgeeaton I'd expect Labout to win quite easily in fact. Greens probably 2nd.
@Yoona939 @georgeeaton living, polling and canvassing in Bristol West I doubt they are that near. Let alone winning
@timwig @georgeeaton remember, 5 party politics. Exit polling has never been attempted for such variables and volitility
@timwig @georgeeaton If Greens are 4-10% behind in both then start questioning exits
@timwig @georgeeaton I don't think Greens will get that close in either Norwich or Bristol. And Beebs Maths have them winning 1
@timwig @georgeeaton if I can butt in. The BEEBs projection of two Green seats is a signifier for me that Exit Poll is a little dodgy
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB Tories taking mostly Lib Dem seats. The people they needed to hold on.
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB Coalition had 71 majority. Second Tory coalition will have 13-15 majority at very best. Won but lost?
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB Irony is James that best case scenario majority (Libs, DUP, Tories) from Beeb numbers is now 13!
@PickardJE @stephenfoley Tories have won the wrong seats. Wiped out the people they need for coalition
@PickardJE @stephenfoley even with Libs and DUP that's a majority of 13.....the coalition had a majority of 71!
@PickardJE @stephenfoley don't be amazed if a new Lib leadership put Libs in opposition benches.
@PickardJE @stephenfoley Clegg and Alexander will be gone. Think Libs fancy voting through Tory policies again?
@PickardJE @MSmithsonPB think Tories can get EU referendum bill through now? I don't
@PickardJE @MSmithsonPB coalition had majority of 73. Ironically if exit poll is right that will now be maybe 10 as best case scenario!
@PickardJE @MSmithsonPB do Tories have numbers for EU referendum now? Doubt Libs would vote for it now. Especially with Clegg gone
@maitlis he's finished though isn't he. Resignation? How can he not?
@MSmithsonPB @gcunning12 I'd think stable Tory majority is both Libs and Tories doing OK? Tories done too well?
@MSmithsonPB @gcunning12 would Lib Dems not just join opposition now?
@MSmithsonPB @gcunning12 parliament will be fascinating if exit is correct. Tories more seats but worse off?
@MSmithsonPB @StuartWilksHeeg high turnout obviously has to eminate from young voters.
@MSmithsonPB @StuartWilksHeeg Sunderland an old population Mike. No students. Most young migrate to Newcastle for work.
@AndyShepp_rd @MSmithsonPB I'd wait. These exit polls don't pass the eye test with me yet!
@MSmithsonPB @jameschappers seeing odd things though. Labour to possibly hold 5-6 in Scotland, is  rumour going around?
@MSmithsonPB @jameschappers I'll be watching Labour's performance in in Lib Dem/Tory seats before I decide.
@MSmithsonPB @jameschappers was thinking that just after I posted!
@MSmithsonPB @jameschappers I agree actually Mike.
@MSmithsonPB no loyalty in betting is their Mike. Ice cold!
@MSmithsonPB just think 4 (large) party exit polling has never been attempted. Volatile vote. Could be recipe for outliers
@MSmithsonPB I'm going to stick my neck out and say result will be close-ish to Yougov. Not Beebs. Maybe 290ish?
@MSmithsonPB BEEB are polling that UKIP doing very well nationally. Labour poorly. But Labour doing v.well in Thanet and UKIP poorly there?
@MSmithsonPB Yougov using same validated 6000 sample for "exit poll". And with 4 years of data, experience modelling 4 party politics. Daily
@MSmithsonPB Yougovs 6000 sample has been validated, by fact it produced exact same results as all other last week poll samples (20k?)
@MSmithsonPB my issue. This is the first time anyone has attempted to exit poll an election where 4 parties could poll over 15% in any seat.
@MSmithsonPB my spider senses are tingling tonight. I can't understand how the BEEB numbers are right. I'm still trying to decide
@MSmithsonPB without knowing where they're wrong, or why they're wrong. Just knowing there is a bug somewhere!
@MSmithsonPB in my day job, working for a search engine,  I'm paid to have an instinct for when huge amounts of data are wrong, somewhere
@obsdalepk @RiazMMM @MSmithsonPB only 3 parties competing for seats in England then. Four in 2015. Another unknown variable
@MSmithsonPB were 40 seats off. If theyre 40 seats off tonight Labour could be biggest party amazingly!
@MSmithsonPB can bookies sue polling companies? Haha. They'll want to throttle them.
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB point is if UKIP are doing very well in some seats but not others, would suggest EXIT poll is very hard to nail.
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB if I was a Tory I'd probably want Farage to win!  As that would show legitimacy of of BEEB swing numbers
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB Labour would be nowhere near there if Beeb swing is correct. BEEB are showing UKIP doing very very well.
@jameschappers @MSmithsonPB Thanet is interesting. I really dont think BEEB exit poll could be correct if Labour are competing
@justin_mcguirk If you have any faith in mathematics result should be somewhere between Yougov and BEEB poll.......!  295-305?
@justin_mcguirk I work for a search engine.
@MSmithsonPB @wwellesley Tories would have been devestated with 315 in 2010. Much has changed!
@148notout @faisalislam Seriously doubt BEEB exit poll is completely accurate. Yougovs exit poll had Tories on 284
@owenjbennett @MSmithsonPB if BEEB exit poll was right Labour would be nowhere near in seats like Thanet.
@owenjbennett @MSmithsonPB that would also suggest the BEEBs exit poll is gibberish as well......
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB @wwellesley which would suggest Yougovs 6k sample is an accurate one. Making their "exit poll" legitimate
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB @wwellesley Last week of polling has been maybe a 30k combined sample? And they're all very similar
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB @wwellesley I'd wait and see personally.  I'd think Yougovs numbers are more likely to be correct
@danbrusca @MSmithsonPB as this 6k sample agreed with the 20-30k of samples from last 48 hours or so.
@danbrusca @MSmithsonPB for that logic to work, all samples in the last 3 days would have to be wrong. 20-30k?
@Samfr I think Tories will get about 290-295. Going on the average of the 2 exit polls.
@Samfr seriously wouldn't trust Beebs numbers. Opinion polls, and the 2nd Yougov exit poll just out would suggest its a bit of an outlier.
@Samfr Dont look at the 2nd exit poll Sam. Yougovs exit poll hasTories only on 283 seats! #Bubble #Burst
@MSmithsonPB I'd bet Tories get about 290 to 295.
@MSmithsonPB I agree with Kellner. I suspect opinion polls, Yougov exit poll, Beeb exit polls are all a bit off. Result somewhere in middle!
@MSmithsonPB Kellner was saying he thinks both opinion polls and beeb exit poll are wrong. With result somewhere in the middle. Ie. This
@MSmithsonPB Kellner seems sceptical. Thinks opinion polls and exit polls are both possibly wrong. Result somewhere in the middle?
@MSmithsonPB Can Tories form a decent majority? Labour/SNP/Greens/Plaid would 308 seats?
@MSmithsonPB Tories would also now need Lib Dems and DUP for a coalition. As they would have done too well against the Libs!
@MSmithsonPB Lib Dems wiped out. Would Clegg survive? Could Libs support Tories again?
@MSmithsonPB the exit poll numbers, even if bang on, still make a very interesting situation
@sportingbench @MSmithsonPB exit poll sample is much smaller than combined opinion polls.
@adrian_newnham @scovers123 @MSmithsonPB in 92 the exit polls were as bad as the election polls
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB assuming the exit polling is more correct than the election polling!
@stevealbury @MSmithsonPB funnily, think Tories will be worse off than 2010. Will need Lib Dems and DUP now.
@Donnie_Eagle @MSmithsonPB Tories would need Lib Dems and DUP to form government
@Donnie_Eagle @MSmithsonPB exit poll is a hung parliament mate.....
@TonyM70 @MSmithsonPB If the Tories win, you're still going to wake up a loser mate.
@MSmithsonPB I'll wait. Remember exit poll was also way off in 1992!
@DrParamonos @MSmithsonPB you're assuming exit polling is any more accurate than election polling! We'll see.
@MSmithsonPB if exit poll is correct, might Nick Clegg have lost seat? Would be a good twist!
@MSmithsonPB Lib Dems absolutely wiped out in exit poll. Will be interesting
@MSmithsonPB @SabreOfTruth Exit poll was spot on in 2010. Remember Tories saying it was gibberish. Then it actually happened
@RachelSJohnson bet you thought it couldn't get any worse!
@MSmithsonPB @robinthemint they say ignorance is bliss. True. Wish I didn't care about politics!
@MSmithsonPB @robinthemint god. So am I. Elections are mentally tiring.
@LeightonVW @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB Cameron should really just resign with no majority coalition. Don't drag it out.
@LeightonVW @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB Voting down budget = Labour PM with no new election.
@LeightonVW @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB voting down Queens speech = Labour PM with no election.
@LeightonVW @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB If Labour are close-ish to Tories they can take power whenever they want in my opinion
@LeightonVW @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB fixed term parliament act worst bit of legislation in living memory?
@whaletweeter @MSmithsonPB doubt betting will slow on this for another month! So much uncertainty. People bet on uncertainty
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB ask a bookie for fair odds on a Tory seat win and they'll say 6-1. But people are backing them at much much lower!
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB and that is the vicious circle of how bookies make money. People placing money at low odds, and then losing the bet
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB but the lower odds go the more people think it's a "sure thing" so they bet even more on it!
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB So if bets on Tories are high, they lower odds to try and dissuade even more people betting on them.
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB if they had to pay out to 50'000 gamblers at 8-1 they would go bankrupt. They only have a certain amount of money
@spenceh95 @MSmithsonPB bookies set odds to protect themselves from the gambling. Nothing to do with who they think will win
@LordAshcroft @lockhartm don't think voters realize what type of service pollsters offer them for free. Especially the philanthropists.
@LordAshcroft @lockhartm working in a smaller scale data compiling/modelling operation myself I can promise you it's a heck of a lot.
@LordAshcroft @LBC my younger sister, and her friend used an app on Facebook to decide........it told them to vote Lib Dem!
@LordAshcroft @philiptaylor51 @pollytoynbee Phil, do you know how much polling costs? I'm sure they all have better things to spend it on!
@MSmithsonPB @McGinOxford @Bonn1eGreer Labwill lose 41 max in Scotland. If they win 50 from Tories that's a basically a gain of 100 seats
@jamessimo1980 @lmharpin you sound like a nice chap
@GabbySabbini @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB parties cease to exist, when they have no members, activists, donors. That's the bigger picture.
@GabbySabbini @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB already lost 50% of councillors, activists etc etc. Could lose 50% of MPs tonight.
@GabbySabbini @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB Many Lib Dems will feel they can't survive as a party, with another Tory coalition.
@GabbySabbini @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB if Clegg is the barrier to a deal with Labour, he's gone. They're a democratic party.
@keiranpedley @GabbySabbini @MSmithsonPB I think if Cameron can't form a majority, both he and Clegg would resign. Basically.
@keiranpedley @GabbySabbini @MSmithsonPB key phrase is "while Clegg is leader". His resignation/sacking would maybe be part of deal.
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB Most Labour bills, SNP would agree with anyway. But SNP wouldn't dare bring them down.
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB if Labour get around 290+ seats I don't think they'd need SNP. But could still rely on them, in truth.
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB personally, I think Clegg would resign as leader, if Tories not biggest party. He's tied to them politically
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB don't think Clegg would personally do deal with Milliband. Lib Dems might though!
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB depends who is leader. Clegg has nowhere else to go. But his party may push him out.
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB Incumbuncy bonus, in theory, should show up in named polls. Tories actually do worse in named polls.
@RuthDavidsonMSP Tories usually commence the conspiracy theories when they think they're going to lose
@RuthDavidsonMSP there are police at all polling stations Ruth.....gibberish
@AndyWillimott intimidating minority voters. Yeah....democracy
@sharman1973 @MSmithsonPB @sportingindex wouldn't amaze me if SNP ended up under 45 seats. Wouldn't amaze me if they won 59 either!
@sharman1973 @MSmithsonPB @sportingindex depends if that is a one off blip, or actual ongoing late swing.
@sharman1973 @MSmithsonPB @sportingindex Labour polled better in final Scottish poll. Up around 27%. SNP down 5%
@beinglittle @Northststandard Trying to drive out people who have lived in area for generations, and replace them with dumb hipsters.
@beinglittle @Northststandard all bars on North Street now are extremely expensive. A tragedy.
@beinglittle @Northststandard I suspect they price the beer/food so only people like you come in. #gentrification
@goodbyeroy @Northststandard gentrification is a horrible horrible thing
@goodbyeroy @Northststandard if you can just replace the takeaways, with high end sushi bars, and you'll have your own middle class heaven
@Northststandard it's why you moved to that location right? gentrification?
@Shonette @Andyy_P I'm sure developers will own that as well in the next 10 years. Luxury flats etc
@bambibomb @Northststandard @theoldbookshop replace all the buildings with pricey bars/restaurants,you won't have to see a poor person again
@robchamberspfc @Northststandard @Upfest well, if you're into gentrification.
@faygadsby @Northststandard @UStandardBris soon the rents will rise, for all horrid surrounding shops, and all poor people will leave. yay
@seanpierce @Northststandard the gentrification of Bedminster continues
@Shonette @Andyy_P worst hipster bar of all time. They don't even serve lager
@stephenob21002 @MSmithsonPB na. One poll recently showed UKIP had taken almost as much Labour as they have Tory. Was 1% difference
@MSmithsonPB On a uniform swing, Labour would win around 295 seats with that result.
@stephenob21002 @MSmithsonPB question is, who is changing their mind. The Tory 60% or the Labour 40%? Or is it about equal?
@stephenob21002 @MSmithsonPB  Think 14% of Tory 2010 support and 9% of Labour 2010 support, back UKIP. Not huge difference.
@tobyharnden @Telegraph of the Telegraph's 400'000 readers, aren't 99% going to be core Tory voters anyway?
@tobyharnden @Telegraph I'm not even sure The Sun would resort to this. It's disrespectful to readers.
@richie_1994wale @MSmithsonPB 33.8% vs. 33.6%. Well, technically!
@MSmithsonPB the more "don't knows", the harder it is to create a reliable poll. Late in campaigns, more people decide, so polls converge
@MSmithsonPB people get confused when polls "converge" late on. But it's just because people have made up their minds.
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB I'd start applying for jobs with The Mirror mate
@LabourBloke @MSmithsonPB 12% typo
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB Mike's a Lib Dem.
@MSmithsonPB a scenario is the phone polls were just wrong all along, spewing up outliers, and are now correct.
@Shelts_lfc @PPudney @MSmithsonPB depends who from UKIP is "going home". An even split, biased to Labour, or biased to Tories?
@Shelts_lfc @PPudney @MSmithsonPB Not sure I agree. I think UKIP "took" 14% of Tories  2010 vote and 9% of Labour's. Not a huge difference
@followmorris90 @jaay89 @britainelects does currently. As he's a peer
@ChadwickFocus @MSmithsonPB my point being, polls might not have changed at all in campaign. The ups and downs being sample variations
@paulsmithlondon @MSmithsonPB @YouGov too true. Yougov poll over 1000 a day though. Ashcroft is about 1500 a week!
@fideidefensor @pollingobs @MSmithsonPB A Tory winning Lib Dem seats is status quo. Not a gain. Assuming hung parliaments
@fideidefensor @pollingobs @MSmithsonPB problem is the Tories have been polling to take Lib Dem seats. Not Labour.
@MSmithsonPB @StephenDFisher go on any 21 year olds Facebook page and they're all telling eachother to register or to vote.
@MSmithsonPB @StephenDFisher suspect turnout will be high. Especially with the young. Social media has changed a lot
@MSmithsonPB @StephenDFisher "bet" the appropriate word
@chrisevans1 @Telegraph newspapers showing great pity for their sources. Who are all in prison for accepting newspapers bungs
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc they overpolled Lib Dems but that doesn't mean they underpolled Tories/Lab. Incorrect assumption.
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc And pollsters didn't under poll Labour or Tories in 2010. They got them exactly right.
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc Tories gained 7% on Labour in last 10-ish days in 1992. Huge momentum.
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc 1992 wasnt polling error. Huge Tory swing showed up clearly in polls. They just ran out of time.
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc well I've spotted two clangers skimming through. So I doubt research took more than hour or so!
@PurbeckPashmina @MSmithsonPB @LordAshcroft not a great audience on the day. Why they do them day before!
@_a_y @MSmithsonPB @LordAshcroft only illegal to collect data on election day. Presumably, sample will be previous 48 hours.
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc Why would you be shy to vote for most attractive party anyway? Cameron status quo?
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc bored journalists write 1992 shy Tory stories. For last 25 years
@shaunjlawson @MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc naaaaa they've been factoring in Shy Tory factor since their first first polls.
@MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc Assuming polls are wrong is like assuming climate change isn't man made.
@MSmithsonPB @ElectionsEtc forecasters are the fire worshippers of the political spectrum
@MSmithsonPB Labour have been well ahead with undecids for 3+ weeks
@JBeattieMirror @Survation if you look at polls in last 48 hours, its hard to see how Tories can be largest party..."glimmer of hope".....ha
@JBeattieMirror @Survation Glimmer of hope? Every final poll has them winning most seats....
@peterthepig @MSmithsonPB Polling 26% in Scotland tonight. Probably 15 seats.
@peterthepig @MSmithsonPB Labour could do better in Scotland remember. Tactical voting.
@MSmithsonPB @davieclegg Labour doing better
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB Kellners projections are based on no known data. Certainly not Yougovs.
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB You're cross referencing a personal projection by Kellner with actual real polling data by Yougov
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB there's no marginal data in the Yougov poll. Any yougov poll
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB you've put 2+2 together and got 876065.
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB being a symbolic life preseident of a company doesn't mean you have much to do with it.
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB Peter's personal projections have never ever correlated with Yougov polling data.
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB the conclusion you've jumped to is that a personal projection by Peter Kellner is linked to Yougov polling
@MSmithsonPB @Alex_0wen I've always assumed Peter's work for papers is his own personal work. Nothing to do with Yougov
@missmeow16 @gjb70 no incumbancy factor. Tories actually do worse in named polls....
@MSmithsonPB @Alex_0wen In a business "president" is a completely symbolic position. I doubt Peter has worked in polling for years
@MSmithsonPB @Alex_0wen mainly because in the past Yougov have done projections and they've been completely different to Peters!
@MSmithsonPB @Alex_0wen seriously doubt Peter's personal projections are linked at all to yougov.
@MSmithsonPB @Alex_0wen you've jumped to a massive incorrect conclusion Alex
@Alex_0wen @MSmithsonPB no. Projections are rarely linked to polling data
@MSmithsonPB @suttonnick Tory oned sound a bit defeatist to me.
@Samfr @LeightonVW @MSmithsonPB marginal data says nothing of the sort
@alexquinn35 @LeightonVW @MSmithsonPB Kellner forecasts that his own company is clueless?
@LeightonVW @MSmithsonPB The Times/Sun pay him large amounts of money.
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB Rupert gives Guido permission to release picture now campaign is over....
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB Guido has probably had this for months. Held it back when he thought Tories could win majority
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB Guido releasing dirt only when he decides Tories can't win majority....where was this 2 weeks ago?
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB Guido waits until Cameron has already lost election before he releases....brave Paul.
@tnewtondunn @MSmithsonPB How can Peter's company poll a Labour lead in seats, but he polls a 20 seat Tory lead?
@tnewtondunn @MSmithsonPB you must be paying Kellner well. His projection disagrees completely with his own companies (Yougov) final poll!
@RahulAKaitheri @MSmithsonPB @tnewtondunn @YouGov they did 6000 in 2010. So way more than record
@tnewtondunn @MSmithsonPB not a 1% lead...?!
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB "Labour get 10 more seats than people expected!!!".....no they got exactly what the data said
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPBdon't often agree with Guido. But he's right. Projections are often just to create headlines and future headlines
@GuidoFawkes @MSmithsonPB it defies all known mathematical logic. Believe me I've looked
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB working in computer science/data/digital technology. I can tell you it changes hugely in 2 years. Let alone 25!
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB people who comment about 1992 need to remember that was before the digital revolution......
@keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB pre internet polling, and post internet polling are worlds apart. And can't be compared
@MSmithsonPB looking at all polls in internet era, there's no reason to think they won't get the two biggest parties correct.
@MSmithsonPB think the internet has permanently ended those days Mike. Their problem back then was getting the samples in
@turbogeek421 @MSmithsonPB @mrjamesob they mix raw numbers(20%) with verbals (four out of 10) to semantically confuse people
@turbogeek421 @MSmithsonPB @mrjamesob ie. Tories/Libs will probably be at 30%!
@turbogeek421 @MSmithsonPB @mrjamesob when they say "four out of 10" instead of 40% its usually because its an unremarkable result.
@LouiseMensch @MSmithsonPB Tories getting slowly destroyed from within. By their unwillingness to represent young people.
@LouiseMensch @MSmithsonPB most emails going out to people aged 50+ with better things to be doing.
@LouiseMensch @MSmithsonPB no offense Mike, but showing why Tories have problems with activism.
@robertdartford @MSmithsonPB like Tories, UKIP suffer in having support all over England. I think
@robertdartford @MSmithsonPB 80+ seats in London. FPTP is bias towards parties that have most of their support in such places. Ie. Labour
@ariehkovler @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB national average swing is irrelevant basically. Labour want most of it to be in places like London
@ariehkovler @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB system is bias to Labour as all of their support is condensed into small areas of country
@ariehkovler @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB Tories suffer hugely from having equal support in most areas of country.....lose 30ish seats.
@ariehkovler @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB 80+ seats in London. Highly beneficial to have support condensed in certain areas
@nadd3rz @DD1958 @MSmithsonPB @UKLabour what gibberish mate. Tories just change the definition of "inequality"......!
@nadd3rz @MSmithsonPB you mean the educational and business capital of the country
@forwnews @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB a 6% London swing will be equalised by a 0.2% Norfolk swing. And so on....
@forwnews @AJBThomson @MSmithsonPB remember.Labour win virtually no seats in the entire South West. And excluding London,entire south east
@MSmithsonPB Mike. In 2010, Yougov's final daily poll had a huge 6000 sample. And they nailed the result. Any repeat do you know?
@eusebio13 @MSmithsonPB @MIkef45 in theory the more people you interview the more stable/consistent  your results
@eusebio13 @MSmithsonPB @MIkef45 e.g Yougov poll 1000 a day on the internet. Phone polls only manage 1000 a week.
@eusebio13 @MSmithsonPB @MIkef45 Phone polls problems have always been getting the numbers. Convincing people to sign up.
@eusebio13 @MSmithsonPB @MIkef45 how many 22 year olds even have a land line. And want to be called on it? Etc etc
@eusebio13 @MSmithsonPB @MIkef45 I'd say its more younger vs. older. People under 35 hate being called on the phone
@sharman1973 @MSmithsonPB the most consistent in my opinion. Yougov
@captaincarroll @missmeow16 @Mancman10 just means a one-off rogue result
@captaincarroll @missmeow16 @Mancman10 so there is a bias in the people polled. Which reflects in the results. Which is called an outlier
@captaincarroll @missmeow16 @Mancman10 if they're struggling to get interviewees they are forced to include more people from a certain party
@captaincarroll @missmeow16 @Mancman10 pollsters try to interview people who support all parties. To get a representative group of people
@MSmithsonPB the problem phone polls have always had is they struggle to to get samples. And are hence can never be daily
@MSmithsonPB remember....Yougov sample is 1000 per day. Phone polls are typically 1000 per week. Yougov sample 7x as big.
@ToryHater2015 @MSmithsonPB of course. Entire theory is an unpopular leader....
@MSmithsonPB all within margin of error
@MSmithsonPB certainly looks a little odd. Don't know how LD, Tories and UKIP are all up. And only Green down?
@MSmithsonPB Tories, UKIP and Libs up. Is that possible?
@highgatealex @montie I remember being very down about Blairs 50 majority in 2005!
@highgatealex @montie naa...he was 3 weeks before. By now polls were about level. Tories had momentum in last week or so
@hendopolis Cameron hinted today that he'll  resign if he can't command majority. I'd ignore the Tory bravado.
@hendopolis giving concessions to parties so they vote for you? Ie. Current coalition
@DPJHodges Loving Dan's faux-confident demeanor as the rest of the Tory press crumble around him
@DPJHodges Dan. Look at those front pages. You're trying to convince me Tories aren't in a huge panic?
@hendopolis how do Daily Mail voters, tactically vote? Presumably vast majority live in Tory seats or Tory/Lib Dem marginals?
@hendopolis god....begging for tactical votes. About as deserate as newspapers get
@JackGMarch @hendopolis @GuidoFawkes truth is I suspect Sun would have switched to Labour without Levenson. Really believe that
@JackGMarch @hendopolis @GuidoFawkes so a reader turnout of 40% and 50% of them vote Labour........and has always been thus.
@JackGMarch @hendopolis @GuidoFawkes funny thing is turnout for Sun readers has always been about 40%!!!!
@JackGMarch @hendopolis @GuidoFawkes  1992 Sun readership = 7.5 million. 2015 Sun readership = 1.4 million.
@hendopolis I don't think The Sun realize its not 1988 anymore. All that happens with these front pages is they're mocked on Facebook
@hendopolis problem is only 1.4 million read The Sun now. It was 3.2 million in 2010
@KevinI @AdrianG161 surely you defraud a promotion, lose, then keep your mouth shut about defrauding a promotion....
@KevinI @AdrianG161 what I'm trying to get at is, what does a boxer gain from defrauding a promotion, losing, then admitting it?
@KevinI @AdrianG161 you expect Manny to stand in court and describe how he defrauded a promotion? Or just admit he embellished much of it?
@KevinI @AdrianG161 sorry, but I know when a story stinks. As they just don't make that much sense. And unravel slowly
@KevinI @AdrianG161 if he had serious injury pre fight wouldn't there be medical records? The only MRI is post fight.....
@KevinI @AdrianG161 isn't it more likely that he exaggerated and embellished a"10th round injury" sorta story to get stronger reaction?
@KevinI @AdrianG161 my question is, if the defrauding of the promotion story is true, why do you admit it?
@KevinI @AdrianG161 Mayweather may sue him. Can you imagine how much gambled money he's liable for? Hundreds of millions?
@KevinI @AdrianG161 do people get that Manny could well get sued by the venue, the promotion, the PPV buyers, attendees, gamblers, bookies?
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost I suspect Manny had issue that wasn't bothering him before or after fight. But Arum/media using it to rebuild rep.
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost sceptical because Arum/media coming up with excuses for Pac loss was most preditable thing off all time....
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost and like most boxers he picked up an injury late on in a losing bout. Chasing a KO
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost its because if Pacquiao goes to court he'll just admit he had no major injury coming into fight
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost claiming you defrauded a promotion could cost you 10s of millions? Why not keep quiet about entire thing
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost I doubt Kevin can explain why a boxer defrauds a promotion. Then admits it. When he can keep quiet?
@KirkSwell @KevinI @CauseEffectPost is it possible he just hurt a muscle late in the fight....and they're riding it as far as they can
@CauseEffectPost @KirkSwell @KevinI did his performance even change between round 1 and 12?
@CauseEffectPost @KirkSwell @KevinI by massive coincidence....when he ran out of ideas. Whole story stinks to high heaven...
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI USADA and commission said they had no pre fight scans
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI MRI literally happened yesterday. By his personal physician. Not pre fight
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost Pacquiao probably hurt himself late in the fight when he was throwing wild shots. But that don't sell a rematch
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost not arguing that he didn't damage a muscle mid fight. I'm arguing that the entire "long term injury" story stinks
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost Kevin. It was his personal physician who examined him. And this was AFTER the fight. Not before
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI I'm not saying I'm right. But you must agree its a very odd story, that really stinks......
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI Thirdly, he met with fight doctors after his request for painkiller and all parties agreed his shoulder was fine
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI secondly, a genuine pre fight injury would have delayed it by 2-4 weeka max?
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI so you defraud a promotion, setting yourself for huge legal challenges, then just admit it?
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI problems with this theory.....first, if Manny lied about an injury to commission he's liable for huge legal action.
@KevinI @ZaafirSalam @MannyPacquiao or he just didn't have a major injury pre fight. Much more likely
@KevinI @mytzplyx terrible made up stories tend to unravel
@KevinI @mytzplyx my point is, when the whole Arum/media story stinks.....things like this matter
@KevinI @mytzplyx Charles, they don't let you date legal documents in the wrong year. They become voided. No way they'd allow it
@KevinI @alibomaye7 no way anyone would let you sign a 2015 legal document as 2014!
@KevinI @alibomaye7 when the whole Arum story sounds rotten, the wrong year matters
@KevinI @alibomaye7 minor mistake......this whole Arum story stinks!
@Seb_Hemperor @KevinI Floyd has hand problems. If he took painkillers he could punch harder....sure. But also wreck himself
@Seb_Hemperor @KevinI painkillers are considered PEDs in boxing. They allow you to punch harder. Don't hand them out easily
@Seb_Hemperor @KevinI Pacquiao told them he was fine to fight even after they declined to give him injections
@KevinI @AdrianG161 It proves Pacquiao only decided to be bothered by his muscle problem when he lost
@KevinI @eztalks so Arum feeds you all some in fight "muscle injury" story and you all jump all over it
@KevinI @eztalks websites have to keep Asian markets happy. Writing articles about Manny being medicore aint happening
@KevinI @eztalks come on Kevin. Didn't take Einstein to know the media would find a way to talk Floyd down once he easily beats the guy....
@tomwilson23 @DPJHodges Bookies/betting markets were over 100 seats off Tories correct result in 2010. Pollsters 6-7 seats.
@tomwilson23 @DPJHodges if gamblers were correct all bookies would instantly go out of business. Favourites win less than 50% of time
@tomwilson23 @DPJHodges that's crazy. The entire principle of gambling is most stakes don't win.....!
@DPJHodges @tomwilson23 its not what "the bookies think". They set odds based on where the money is being placed by gamblers
@DPJHodges @tomwilson23 Dan.....bookies don't decide odds. Gamblers do.
@DPJHodges @lukeakehurst @Ed_Miliband he'd have to win 50 more seats than Labour? Todays polls have Labour as largest party....
@DPJHodges @lukeakehurst @Ed_Miliband you must realise somewhere in your head that it will be very hard for Cameron to stay in power
@DPJHodges @lukeakehurst @Ed_Miliband Labour polling to have most seats in last 3 polls......etc
@DPJHodges @roadto326 good on ya Dan. Ignoring all that maths, logic mumbo jumbo
@DPJHodges @charliemansell all Cameron could do in government with no coalition majority is put through Labour friendly policies?
@DPJHodges @charliemansell under fixed term parliament act there is no new election if government budget defeated. Opposition just take over
@DPJHodges @charliemansell what's point of leading a coalition with no majority, and also no ability to call new election for 5 years?
@DPJHodges @charliemansell ignore the bravado. Cam will  have to resign with no coalition majority. With the fixed term parliament act.
@DPJHodges @charliemansell so youre obviously suggesting Cameron can form a majority bigger than Labour/SNP/Green/Plaid?
@DPJHodges the more "don't knows" in samples the more likely your poll is wrong. Hence vastly different figures between companies
@DPJHodges your last point is plain delusional. Polls only cluster because people have made up minds.
@DPJHodges polls are far apart in earlier stages as more "don't knows" in samples so they don't assign them to parties
@DPJHodges polls clustering, as voters have made up minds. And less "don't knows" in the data....irrelevant!
@fucofflabour @DPJHodges @screwlabour polls cluster together when people make up their minds. Less "undecideds" in the data.
@DPJHodges polling companies "cluster" near the end as people have made up their minds. Their are less "umdecideds" in the polling data
@DPJHodges the closer polls are in equilibrium to each other, the more likely they are to be accurate.
@DPJHodges I can't be bothered to explain A Level Mathematics to you but I'll give you the laymans version to you.
@DPJHodges secondly, polls have been clustered for at least 8-9 days. Maybe even 10 days. Ignore last 9 days of polls?
@DPJHodges Dan? You know clustering polls are a sign of accuracy?!
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb to be largest party Tories will have to poll 4% higher than Labour in Eng. Last 3 poll they've been level.
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb when Tories are seeing constant polls showing Labour equalling them in England. They should be panicking
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb todays polls show Labour doing so well in England that they may win most seats even without Scotland
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb extensive polling data this week showing Labour doing amazingly well in England/marginals
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb I suspect the motivation is to wind up Tories and motivate Labour voters to show up
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb Labour Uncut.....a radical, Ed hating, Blairite blog basically put the same article out last week
@WDave2013 @stephenkb @montie @NewStatesman Labour Uncut are run by people like Dan Hodges......radical Blairites who hate current party
@WDave2013 @montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb Yeah. Its impossible and illegal to know postal vote counts now. After system change
@montie @NewStatesman @stephenkb @DPJHodges Tim. Its a rehash of a Labour Uncut Blog article published last week. Attention seeking......
@SabreOfTruth @Jamin2g @DPJHodges todays polls show they can form majority with no SNP
@Jamin2g @DPJHodges no polling companies take projections seriously. Not in slightest
@Jamin2g @DPJHodges projections are a guess. People going against the grain. Not related at all to polling or data
@PickardJE @DPJHodges Gambling markets had Tories winning something like 390 seats in 2010....
@PickardJE @DPJHodges you know gambling markets were about 100 seats off for Tories in 2010!
@LeightonVW @DPJHodges @justin_mcguirk He knows they're showing Camerons resignation relatively soon
@LeightonVW @DPJHodges @justin_mcguirk Dan wouldn't be tweeting about ignoring polls if he was relaxed with them
@LeightonVW @DPJHodges @justin_mcguirk cute that you think Dan has any access to the inner workings of CCHQ!
@DPJHodges @justin_mcguirk I suspect its a Corporal Jones "Dont Panic!!!" brand of relaxed
@highgatealex @DPJHodges sorry to break it to you but polling companies have completely changed their systems since then
@DPJHodges They cluster for a reason. Companies mastering their data and methodology.
@DPJHodges And your logic is crazy. Clustering polls suggests they're right. An equilibrium.
@DPJHodges Dan...you tell people to ignore polls when you don't like them.
@joeadamson @iainmartin1 @GeorgeFoulkes Lab lose all seats in Scot, they'll still have 10 more seats than Tories by todays polls.
@joeadamson @iainmartin1 @GeorgeFoulkes important point is Tories had 10% lead in Eng in 2010. Won by 48 seats. 0% lead today in Eng
@GeorgeFoulkes @iainmartin1 pollsters are showing Labour with most seats despite Scottish losses. Tied with Tories in England
@iainmartin1 @GeorgeFoulkes assure you Iain. Even with Scottish losses Labour are polling today to have more seats than Tories.
@iainmartin1 @GeorgeFoulkes Iain. Tories beat Labour by 10% in England in 2010. All 3 polls today, in England they are neck and neck....
@iainmartin1 @DPJHodges Love the fact Tory pundits ignore virtually all polls. Maths, logic? Meh!
@DPJHodges @Gerald_Ashley @iainmartin1 @alexmassie Scotland could be huge tactical voting. According to polling. Labour could retain 10-15
@DPJHodges @Gerald_Ashley @iainmartin1 @alexmassie stats, maths, facts and logic disagree with you Dan. As usual
@Smiffy_Beaks @MSmithsonPB @DPJHodges a basic knowledge of maths will tell him convergence/equilibrium suggests they're right. Not wrong
@Smiffy_Beaks @MSmithsonPB @DPJHodges my first point is the polls have barely changed in 10 days. Ignore them all?
@Smiffy_Beaks @MSmithsonPB @DPJHodges I'm not sure I should waste my time. Dan suggests  all polls that don't show a 6% Tory lead are wrong
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB polls  take into account shy voters now. They'll be overpolling the parties where they think that will happen
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB Labour were underpolled in 2010. Not Tories
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB historical? Happened once?
@preno67 @MSmithsonPB @YouGov being older voters many will want to use votes for serious change. Not more of the same.
@preno67 @MSmithsonPB @YouGov UKIP voters, are going to be stubborn. You don't like UKIP unless you are pretty passionate/angry/intent
@preno67 @MSmithsonPB @YouGov hilarious that either Tories or Labour will be vying over legitimacy
@joyfeed @MSmithsonPB ballot prompt is supposed to replicate how you'd react in booth
@PaulDesproperty @MSmithsonPB have to admit though I get confused on how they come up with 3rd/4th party numbers at times
@PaulDesproperty @MSmithsonPB they polled Lib Dems 7-8% too high in 2010 but still got Labour and Tories exactly right
@PaulDesproperty @MSmithsonPB you'll find with polling that, errors made with 3rd party %s don't always affect the top 2
@PolicyRob @MSmithsonPB not as linear as just taking 5% from UKIP and handing to Tories. Don't work that way
@PolicyRob @MSmithsonPB hmmm when UKIP poll low (9% say) Tories don't always benefit much
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 David Haye broke his foot against Klitshko. Blamed that for loss.Guys like Kevin laughed hin out of the sport....
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 It aint in any boxing sites interests to admit Manny Pacquiao is nowhere near as good as Floyd Mayweater
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48  any boxing fan on the planet who didn't think A: Arum would have an excuse for losing B: media would sell it...?
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 you know the pre fight injury story stinks. Exaggeration. Probably just picked up injury in a losing effort
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 If Manny was actually injured pre fight he'll get sued by everyone involved. Including Floyd.
@KevinI @karlt187 instead you talk about typical muscle injuries like its the biggest conspiracy ever
@KevinI @karlt187 an honest response is "this is boxing. Injuries happen all the time. Its irrelevant"
@KevinI @karlt187 you keep Pacfans sweet by simply talking Pacquiao up no matter if he wins or loses
@KevinI @karlt187 writing "Floyd is the better fighter" before trashing his win, was most predictable media response ever
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 so why does it matter if Manny developed a muscle issue mid fight?
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 everyone knows to keep Asian web traffic you're going to have to talk down Floyd beating Manny
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 Implying the illegitimacy of Mayweather win was the most obvious media response to a Pacquiao loss!
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 if he was allowed to fight its because a torn muscle wasn't going to hold him back too much....
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 undeniable? That he's injured, post fight. Certainly. Well according to personal physicians
@KevinI @ChristianSanc48 before making lots of excuses for pacquiao.....
@KevinI @absmith_12 Kev. You might not be allowed to take Pacquiaos endless stupid stories on (Asian web traffic) but I am
@absmith_12 @MGMcls @EZgoin_hobbyist @KevinI when did he tear it? Could have been 10th round. Arum provived no evidence at all of pre fight
@absmith_12 @MGMcls @EZgoin_hobbyist @KevinI its an obsene exaggeration. Trying to convince pacfans that he could ever compete
@absmith_12 @EZgoin_hobbyist @KevinI that's why he was throwing power rights all night. Wake up
@absmith_12 @EZgoin_hobbyist @KevinI "one" arm? You read too many Pacquiao boards
@KevinI @absmith_12 you mean I call you out for just going along with Arums crazy stories....
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost and the media don't question the oddest story ever as they want a rematch as well
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost so Arum uses it as an excuse for the easy Mayweather win to try and hype a rematch....
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost of course, then you fight and it's probably worse by the end of it.
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost he was checked out by doctors pre fight and everyone, including Manny, agreed he was fine to fight.
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost Manny only disclosed training injury when they blocked his painkiller use.
@KevinI @CauseEffectPost there was no MRI pre fight.........you're talking about a post fight MRI
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI Mannys own doctors said he was fine to fight. Using it as a crutch now he's lost
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI secondly, if you read, Manny had shoulder checked with commission doctors pre fight and it was fine.
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI you need to read more. USADA never told specific injury. They deny completely. Dont believe Arum press releases...
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI @mdthemd @MannyPacquiao there was no MRI pre fight. They only did that post fight.
@KevinI @YahooSports sure boxers tear muscles all the time late in fights. But never talk about it
@KevinI @YahooSports Within 24 Hours Arum has whipped it up into this bizarre conspiracy theory and media just go along with it
@KevinI @YahooSports a guy picks up an injury late in the fight. Not a big deal so never mentions it in post fight interviews....
@KevinI @YahooSports media pundits  playing along with this hugely exaggerated injury excuse to create a rematch tells you everything
@KevinI They didnt. Usada deny they were told of shoulder injury
@KevinI USADA said they had no knowledge of shoulder injury. Just approved use of painkiklers
@KevinI they didn't disclose injury to USADA......they just approved the use of painkillers
@KevinI Painkillers are considered PEDs in boxing. They allow guys to hit harder
@KevinI they approved it on the basis that Manny had commission verified injury. That never happened
@KevinI you guys would be killing Floyd if he was coming out with this crap!
@KevinI shoulder was checked pre fight by neutrals and was 100% fine Kevin. Cleared to fight. No injury pre fight
@KevinI and no media guy will question it as they rely too much on Asian web traffic
@KevinI Obviously Manny picked up injury later on in fight. And they're using it as giant excuse to excuse the loss....
@KevinI Manny said post fight that he didn't throw punches as Floyd was hard to pin down. Nothing to do with injuries
@KevinI Manny said nothing about injury immediatly after fight. Only when he had met with Arum later on
@KevinI shoulder was checked out by fight doctors pre fight and was 100% fine. Manny agreed with them
@KevinI so many holes in that. They never notified USADA of injury. They just asked if they could use painkillers.
@jasjas11 @KevinI he had his shoulder checked out pre figt by commission. 100% fine
@mpertuso615 @KevinI errr who woukd watch? Pay Floyd a 100 million for an easy win?
@jdt599 @KevinI you're a good example of why promoters put out phony excuses though.
@jdt599 @KevinI he won the last round on the cards
@KevinI so its 600 words of unproveable excuses. With "but we make no excuses" at the end
@Gaspodesm8 @KevinI hilarious that you believe it. Like David Hayes broken toe?
@KevinI If you have no excuses keep your fight injuries to yourself. Respect the sport. As Floyd did
@KevinI making lots of excuses. Then ending the sentence with "I make no excuses though"...well you are making excuses
@KevinI So you can make endless excuses. But as long as you say "but I don't make any excuses" at the end it's OK.
@KevinI haha apart from making excuses for absolutely everything's
@KevinI @EquipoDeDinero the press conference had loads of holes in it. They used the statement to correct their own mistakes. All stinks
@KevinI @EquipoDeDinero be quiet about Manny. He's got no class. He knows what goes on. I knew he'd be weaseling his way out of any loss
@KevinI @EquipoDeDinero Kevin. He's right. Obviously big Top Rank PR operation to rebuild his rep based on a normal sort of injury
@KevinI @EquipoDeDinero Mannys usually honest until Arum gets involved
@KevinI @EquipoDeDinero Arum hadn't had a chance to explain the Public Relations strategy
@KevinI Mannys a weasel. No class in defeat. Using in fight injuries as an excuse
@EZgoin_hobbyist @absmith_12 @KevinI Pacquiao fans ignore what happens in ring. Akways fighting a media war....
@EZgoin_hobbyist @absmith_12 @KevinI seriously, even if he did pick up a muscle injury in middle of fight he wasn't doing anything anyway
@EZgoin_hobbyist @absmith_12 @KevinI he didn't start coming out with the phony injury excuses until Arum had got hold of him
@EZgoin_hobbyist @absmith_12 @KevinI Manny was honest in post fight interview. Said he didn't throw punches as Floyd is hard to catch
@EZgoin_hobbyist @absmith_12 @KevinI I think that's the bullshit Arum is trying to make you believe....
@absmith_12 @KevinI Manny struggled hugely with Marquez when he was 25 years old and 35 years old....he'd never beat Floyd in 100 attempts
@KevinI @Fawaz_Ahmed all fighters pick up injuries. They only moan about them if they lose
@KevinI @Fawaz_Ahmed If you didn't think Manny or Floyd were coming out with injury claims if they lost you're crazy!
@KevinI @Fawaz_Ahmed Fight doctors checked the shoulder out, for one, when he finally reported and it was 100% fine
@KevinI @Fawaz_Ahmed not doubting he's making a lot of a injury he picked up late in the fight. But the pre fight stuff sounds BS....
@KevinI @Fawaz_Ahmed Kevin. You seem to think he actually had a pre fight injury? Why? Arum said so?
@Fawaz_Ahmed @KevinI I have. Other than hurting it doesn't inhibit that much. As you saw. Throwing rights all night
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI Mannys probably making the most of a muscle tear he got near end of a lost fight....
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI Manny was checked out by fight docs. Hours before. Shoulder was fine. No way they'd let him fight injured
@CauseEffectPost @KevinI they're confidential records until after the fight. Didn't disclose as it probably didn't exist
@Liljonhernandez @KevinI Would anyone pay to watch Floyd to beat Manny again? Both a year older?
@Peeeteeee @KevinI @YahooSports well hes already beaten him easily
@KevinI @YahooSports easy money. Not surprised!
@KevinI @JasonLesage @YahooSports manny could have 3 arms, he wouldn't push him
@KevinI @JasonLesage @YahooSports Manny needed to show he's at least on the same level
@RealSkipBayless never thought I'd ever compare Pacquiao to David Haye......but
@RealSkipBayless but he didn't lie on forms pre fight. He's lying now. Using an in ring injury that all fighters get, for cry baby excuses
@RealSkipBayless truth is Skip, if Manny did truly hide an injury, and lie on the forms, everyone to do with the promotion will sue him.....
@RealSkipBayless he obviously tore it in the fight. Probably late on. And all the crap about pre fight injuries is made up
@RealSkipBayless turns out Mannys shoulder was checked out by pre fight doctors and was 100%. Manny agreed with them
@RealSkipBayless Like all Mannys lies and excuses this is slowly unraveling......
@RealSkipBayless The only guy I know who has less character than Arum and Roach, is you. You'll cling onto any weasel excuse you can find
@MSmithsonPB said previously, I suspect polling companies actually use these types of data mining/algorithm technologies in final polls
@MSmithsonPB prediction is amazingly close to this. Just from data mining tweets with a super computer
@MSmithsonPB I saw some computer algorithms data mining twitter information today and converting data to party share predictions
@LordAshcroft DC knows if he can't form a majority there is no scenario where he can ever bring in a Conservative policy......he'll resign
@LordAshcroft and by miracle he wins a queens speech with no majority he plans to govern with no majority?! Whats the point?
@LordAshcroft DC is going to squat in No.10 for 3+ weeks with no majority. Then present a Queens speech wity no majority?!
@LordAshcroft think its bravado by Tories. For moral. If DC can't form a majority he obviously resigns. As Brown did.
@LordAshcroft think it's just a lot of bravado from Tories. If Cameron can't form majority he obviously resigns. Like Brown did.
@LordAshcroft Labour give Tories a chance to form majority, but Tory can't, then what else can Labour do? Queen would call Ed to palace
@LordAshcroft truly don't think voters understand that Tories would get chance to succeed as largest party. Chance to form a majority
@LordAshcroft Doubt voters would be as negative if they saw Tories failing to get a majority deal done, Cameron resigning. Next man up....
@LordAshcroft media tend to imply Labour would walk in. They wouldn't. They'd give Cameron a chance. He then fails. Then they walk in!
@LordAshcroft important to make distinction that Labour would only govern with less seats once Cameron already fails.
@Sutheia @LordAshcroft hardly matters. If Cameron has no majority in parliament he resigns. Whether its days or weeks. Still resigns
@LordAshcroft Labour would only form government with less seats, if Cameron fails to form a government. Completely different
@LordAshcroft media tend to ask people about Labour/SNP legitimacy as if they'd go straight in. First dibs. Which isn't the case at all
@LordAshcroft I suspect you left out an important point. That a Labour minority would only move in if the Tory government tried and failed.
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB in mathematics, the closer you get to an equilibrium, the more likely you are to be correct
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB laymans terms - you can guess individual final polls just by lookimg at last weeks "poll of poll"
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB the act of "polling" is arguably just them compiling their data. Not telling you what they think is happening
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB that's what they do in economics. Compile lots of data then just mine/analyse with super computers
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB all pollsters do the same thing, so get similar results!
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB my hunch is they just take all of their polling data, and run it through maths algorithms....for final numbers
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB various mathematical algorithms to predict elections better than single polls. See Nate Silver in USA!
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB They just tweak their methodology towards results their super computer session came up with 2 weeks ago....!
@petertjcooper @MSmithsonPB pollsters know the likely final figures before the last few days. Just hold them back. Then make method switch
@MSmithsonPB @LordAshcroft all individual polls coming togethor towards the "poll of polls" longtime figures....mathematics that is
@MaxBoere @MSmithsonPB a hugely popular incumbent, squeezing past Ken Livingston is a hollow victory!
@MSmithsonPB I suspect your suggesting such negative coverage of Milliband could create "shy Labour"?
@MSmithsonPB Negative campaigning is risky. You don't really know the effect until it happens
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB if the current polls are right its 100% guaranteed. Big "if" though
@blackmore_rob @MSmithsonPB you're crazy right. Ken Livingstone was the opposition! Pundits expected Boris to win by a mile
@StopPCbrainwash @MSmithsonPB @adamboultonSKY probably have 20 more seats in 2015 under av
@StopPCbrainwash @MSmithsonPB @adamboultonSKY hmmmm Tories do better out of AV.
@lescommons @MSmithsonPB Tories were the imcumbents mate......2nd Boris term
@observealot @MSmithsonPB low turnouts hurt Labour.....not Tories
@bbclaurak To conclude, Tories and Libs are screwed. Labour/SNP can take over whenever they want. Even if they lose electiob
A@bbclaurak and for Libs/Tories to vote down Labour they'd need SNP help. And would still be no new election
@bbclaurak Clegg is talking gibberish. Labour/SNP voting down Tories is no new election. Labour/SNP would automatically take power
@bbclaurak Only way to force new election is to vote down budget by 75%. Which would require government to vote against its own budget!
@bbclaurak Tories could vote down Labour Queens speechor budget. But would need SNP help.  And still no new election. Tories return to gov.
@bbclaurak If Labour/SNP vote down a Tory Queens speech or budget there is no new election. Labour and SNP would be put into government.
@bbclaurak literally the only way you could have a 2nd election the next 5 years is if the SNP vote Labour government down. Crazy but true!
@bbclaurak he knows he voted in the fixed term parliament act doesn't he?
@fperraudin yeah....because being in government with Libs involves no concessions
@ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao Arum using an injury he probably got in the 10th round as cry baby excuses.
@ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao ESPN being careful not to mention that fight docs checked the shoulder pre fight and it was 100% fine
@daniel_zamora3 @ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao @JoelLazo3 he had no pre fight injury. Fight docs checked it out. 100% fine
@jamezymac1984 @ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao @PaulMalignaggi mannys personal physician says so. So it must be true...
@jamezymac1984 @ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao @PaulMalignaggi give me a break. Injuries happen late in fights all the time...no excuse
@ESPNBoxing @RealSkipBayless @FloydMayweather Skip works for ESPN? Im from UK and genuinely just thought he was a crazy amateur blogger!
@CPGaren @ESPNBoxing @RealSkipBayless @FloydMayweather the aim in fighting is to win? You know?
@ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao guys using in fight injuries as crybaby excuses? That's rarer. Manny and David Haye?
@ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao any injuru was in fight. Even Manny admits that. In fight injuries happen almost every bout
@ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao ESPN being careful not to mention that Mannys shoulder was checked by fight docs, pre fight and was 100% fine
@thisisnotmark @Mouthgrds4Champ @ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao he had no injury pre fight. Fight Doctors checked it out. 100% fine
@WiteTyson @ESPNBoxing @MannyPacquiao never be a rematch! Who'd pay to see an uncompetitive fight? Again?!
@PacoValcarcel @MannyPacquiao @danrafaelespn if Manny had any honour, he'd take his loss like a man. Not crying excuses
@PugilistProdigy @RangerLE901 Painkillers are PEDs. Have stimulants in them. They were probably concerned about that
@PugilistProdigy @RangerLE901 fight docs checked his shoulders pre fight when he asked for the drugs. No injuries so no drugs
@PugilistProdigy @RangerLE901 he wasn't injured pre fight......lousy excuse, conclusively disproven alreasy
@RangerLE901 @PugilistProdigy @PacoValcarcel Pacfans have no class. Neither does Pacquiao. Accept losing like a man. Not crybaby
@RangerLE901 @PugilistProdigy @MannyPacquiao @PacoValcarcel Manny and his team using typical in fight injuries as cry baby excuses
@RangerLE901 @PugilistProdigy @MannyPacquiao @PacoValcarcel if he was injured fight docs wouldn't have let him fight
@RangerLE901 @PugilistProdigy @MannyPacquiao @PacoValcarcel any injury was in fight. Which happens all the time in boxing
@RangerLE901 @PugilistProdigy @MannyPacquiao @PacoValcarcel fight docs checked his shoulder pre fight and it was 100% fine
@PugilistProdigy @PacoValcarcel any injury was in fight. Probably late in fight
@PugilistProdigy @PacoValcarcel he wasn't injured pre fight. Fight docs signed his shoulder off as 100% fine. As did Manny
@danrafaelespn Manny using a typical in fight injury, as a rather cowardly post fight excuse
@danrafaelespn did anyone actually think Arum, Roach, ESPN would accept a Floyd win gracefully?
@danrafaelespn any injury happened in fight. Probably late. As most injuries do.
@danrafaelespn ESPN spinning it for Arum....you should mention Mannys shoulder was checked by fight docs pre fight and he had no injury
@ianapowers @AdamMumma89 @danrafaelespn Wont be a rematch, mainly, as its not a competitive fight
@AdamMumma89 @danrafaelespn never a rematch....Manny not competitive
@danrafaelespn all boxers pick up injuries late in fights. Not many concuct huge lies as lousy excuses for losing. David Haye?
@danrafaelespn As that would ruin Arums conspiracy theory......
@danrafaelespn ESPN being careful not to mention that Mannys shoulder was checked by fight docs houes before fight. And he had no injury
@Craig_Virgo @danrafaelespn he had no injury pre fight. Doctors cleared his shoulder. They don't let you box with tears!
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 Arum just used a typical, late in fight injury, as a pretty cheap tacky excuse
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 manny covered nothing up. He cleared pre fight shoulder checks....
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 again...doctors cleared his shoulder. Neutral fight doctors. No injury pre fight. Could only be in fight
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 Mannys just using a normal in fight injury as a cry baby excuse for losing
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 any injury was in fight. Probabably late in the fight. As wity most boxing injuries
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 Manny had no injury pre fight. Conclusively proved by fight docs pre fight
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 pre fight doctors cleared Mannys shoulder. You're not allowed to box with tears
@RangerLE901 @ChipReid2014 @danrafaelespn the injury is a terrible excuse from a cry baby
@danrafaelespn who didn't actually think Arum, Manny, ESPN would use some excuse to hype a rematch?
@danrafaelespn fight docs don't let you box with injured shoulders. Any injury probably happened late fight as most do
@danrafaelespn or the obvious fact that Manny and Roach agreed with fight docs that his shoulder was fine?
@danrafaelespn why aren't ESPN mentioning the obvious fact that pre fight doctors checked his shoulder and it was 100% fine?
@bal221 @danrafaelespn any tear would be swinging at shadows for 10 rounds
@bal221 @danrafaelespn unfortunately for pacfans Mannys shoulder was checked out pre fight by fight docs and he had no injury
@PhinsDiehard @KarTuneSsS @danrafaelespn Pacquiao threw no flurries as counter punchers (see Marquez....) knock your head off
@PhinsDiehard @KarTuneSsS @danrafaelespn neither pacquiao or his fans have any class....lets be honest
@PhinsDiehard @KarTuneSsS @danrafaelespn comparing cotto to Mayweather is retarded. As is using late fight injuries as excuses
@PhinsDiehard @danrafaelespn sorry....doctors checked his shoulder out pre fight. It was fine. Pac using late fight injuries as excuses
@WiteTyson @danrafaelespn any injury happened in fight. Probably late. Like most injuries
@WiteTyson @danrafaelespn doctors don't let you fight with torn shoulders.....fight docs signed him off
@WiteTyson @danrafaelespn its a terrible excuse. No class
@svaldezjr23 @danrafaelespn he had no pre fight injury!!! Fight Doctors check shoulders before they sign guys off
@omara341 @danrafaelespn Doctors checked Mannys shoulder pre fight. It was fine. Dan purposefully not mentioning that
@PhinsDiehard @danrafaelespn Manny using late in fight injuries as terrible excuses for rematch. Like David Haye
@PhinsDiehard @danrafaelespn any injury was probably late in fight. Like most boxers tend to get
@PhinsDiehard @danrafaelespn Dans only giving half the story. Pre fight Docs checked Mannys shoulder and it was fine....
@RealSkipBayless all boxers get injured in bouts. Mayweather had shoulder/hand injuries himself. Not many use them as crybaby excuses
@RealSkipBayless Manny obviously using an injury he picked up during the loss to make cry baby excuses
@RealSkipBayless Mannys shoulders were cleared to fight by pre fight doctors. No injuries pre fight. Fir certain
@RealSkipBayless I'm sure Mannys personal physician is being paid well to exaggerate a shoulder injury
@RealSkipBayless hahaha if he had a torn rotator cuff he wouldn't have been passed to fight by pre fight doctors
@RealSkipBayless how could there be a rematch? Nobody would pay to see Manny get outclassed again.
@RealSkipBayless you want a corrupt fight, in a Banana Republic, basically
@RealSkipBayless Judges are there to score fights. Not keep crazy Pacfans happy
@RealSkipBayless Skip angry that neutral judges don't treat Manny like the Asian demi god he thinks he is
@RealSkipBayless Holyfield is well known for his intelligence.....
@RealSkipBayless Manny struggled with Josh Clottey for gods sake. He nearly lost that fight
@RealSkipBayless all of Mannys big wins have been against simple brawlers......Maragrito, Cotto etc
@RealSkipBayless what you're saying is, basically, that Manny can't compete with slick fighters.....well duh
@RealSkipBayless errr he threw and landed more shots than Manny
@RealSkipBayless Manny was wary about being knocked out again on the counter. Lets be honest
@RealSkipBayless counter punchers knock your head off (see Marquez....) when you open up. Why Manny was cagey
@RealSkipBayless haha? What trouble? He landed 81 punches all fight!
@RealSkipBayless Manny has become David Haye.  A joke. No class
@RealSkipBayless remember when David Haye used his broken toe as an excuse for the Klitshko loss!
@RealSkipBayless he didn't fight one handed. He lost a fight, realized he'd picked up an injury and used it as a cry baby excuse
@RealSkipBayless he didn't postpone as he had no pre fight injury. Doctors checked him and he was fine. He himself said he was fine
@RealSkipBayless Manny reported no injuries and they found no injuries pre fight. Meaning he's lying.
@RealSkipBayless at most Manny maybe got an injury late in the fight. As most boxers do. And he's using it as a cry baby excuse
@RealSkipBayless they don't let you start bouts injured.....especially shoulders, arms and hands.
@RealSkipBayless pre fight neutral Doctors and Pacquiao both said he was injury free and clear to fight
@RealSkipBayless boxers shoulders and hands are checked by pre fight doctors for injuries. Pacauiao didn't have an injury
@RealSkipBayless hahaha you're a comedian. Boxers aren't allowed to start fights with shoulder tears Skip.....
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith all boxers get injured in fights. Most don't cry about it. And use it as an excuse...
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith Manny at most had a very minor injury that possibly went late in fight.
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith if you're wondering why cry baby losers come out with excuses its because cry baby pundits believe them
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith Doctors don't let you step into the ring with Torn shoulders Skip. They check your shoulders pre fight....
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith If manny had an injury it must have torn late in the fight. When he slowed down
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith Sadly for you Skip, Doctors signed Manny off as healthy pre fight. BS excuses from a sore loser
@RealSkipBayless @stephenasmith hahaha Skip is a parody account? Surely?
@RealSkipBayless who didn't think Manny would blame a loss on injury?
@RealSkipBayless you're proving, like Manny, you're all talk and excuses. And no action
@RealSkipBayless again....read about it. Manny was checked by physicians. His shoulder was clean. They don't let you box with torn shoulders
@RealSkipBayless the difference is, most boxers don't use in fight injuries as an excuse for losing
@RealSkipBayless If manny did suffer an injury it was obviously late in the fight. As most boxers do
@RealSkipBayless Skip. Manny was checked by doctors pre fight and had no injury whatsoever. He even told doctors he was injury free
@RealSkipBayless haha what did I predict? Skip to use Mannys crybaby excuses for the next decade!
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn they saw no incunbucy effect. In fact it was boosting Labour and Lib Dems
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn Lib Dems did 4% better than normal survation polling when voters saw all candidates on the ballot paper
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn Labour did 2% better than normal Survation polling when voters saw all candidates on the ballot paper.....
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn Tories did 3% worse than normal survation polling when voters saw all of the candidates on the ballot paper......
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn Look at Survations national poll. They sent out 1000 actual ballot papers, with each persons individual MPs on it.
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn 2. Pollsters have tested incumbuncy in the last week and found it benefits Labour!
@DPJHodges @steffanjohn errr. 1. Labour poll better than Tories with undecideds currently....quite a bit better.
@DPJHodges @RahulAKaitheri @May2015NS there is a difference between arrogance and delusion Dan!
@DPJHodges @toady_toby @BBCNormanS @PopulusPolls perfectly obvious parties are tied
@DPJHodges @toady_toby @BBCNormanS @PopulusPolls Dan. Tories have had only  2 leads in the last 8 polls. And they were both 1% leads
@DPJHodges @toady_toby @BBCNormanS @PopulusPolls and Dan chips in with his daily dose of nonsense......
@MrHarryCole It is kind of cute that Harry thinks people even read newspapers any more. I guess its to keep the boss Rupert happy
@MrHarryCole Milliband having a bad campaign as "most newspapers say so". Most newspapers being failing, downmarket Tory rags!
@MrHarryCole Your "newspaper edoresements" line was golden
@LeightonVW @aidan_number_2 @whyoutloud @LordAshcroft @chrishanretty @anthonyjwells how do you calculate probability? Poll data.....
@aidan_number_2 @whyoutloud @LeightonVW @LordAshcroft @chrishanretty @anthonyjwells probability derives from poll data. What many ignore....
@aidan_number_2 @whyoutloud @LeightonVW @LordAshcroft @chrishanretty @anthonyjwells shouldn't probability be based on all known data?
@aidan_number_2 @LeightonVW Look at 2010 betting markets for a decent example. Miles off!
@aidan_number_2 @LeightonVW most gamblers will be wrong. Most stakes will lose. Othewise bookies wouldn't exist
@jonathansc @LeightonVW @BBCr4today surely gambling is smart gamblers(minority) taking advantage of poor ones (majority)
@jonathansc @LeightonVW @BBCr4today isn't essense of gambling, that most stakes are losing stakes?
@jonathansc @LeightonVW @BBCr4today If the majority of gamblers were right, gambling couldn't exist
@DazNewman @LeightonVW politics is simple. If you're a prime minister with no majority, you forfeit.
@DazNewman @LeightonVW isn't Cameron trying to stay in power with no majority the plot?
@LeightonVW @alstewitn @BBCr4today @nick_clegg Queen will ask Labour to form any government they can if PM can't find majority
@LeightonVW @alstewitn @BBCr4today @nick_clegg Cameron can't form majority he should really resign.
@LeightonVW @alstewitn @BBCr4today @nick_clegg pundits seem to think it's possible to be PM with no majority.......!
@LeightonVW @alstewitn @BBCr4today @nick_clegg does it matter? If you can't command majority, you're out. Opposition takes over.
@NTUNews @LeightonVW forecasting isn't based on polling though is it. Fair bit of it is guessing
@drjennings @GabbySabbini @PopulusPolls @YouGov Populous and Yougov only have 1 more poll. Tomorrow. That's it for them
@drjennings @PopulusPolls @YouGov @LeightonVW Survations poll basically showed late ballot booth swing going to Libs and Labour. Not Tories
@drjennings @PopulusPolls @YouGov @LeightonVW Labour did 2% better than polls suggest. Libs did 3% better
@drjennings @PopulusPolls @YouGov @LeightonVW Tories actually did 3% worse than polls are suggesting in realistic, named ballot conditions
@drjennings @PopulusPolls @YouGov @LeightonVW Read Survations latest national poll where they sent actual, named ballot papers to the sample
@LeightonVW @guardian_clark @drjennings next parliament will be 5 years of carnage and misery for whoever "wins"
@LeightonVW @guardian_clark @drjennings A deputy PM who has no Lib Dem support in a safe Lib Dem seat?
@observealot @MSmithsonPB most gamblers are casual gamblers. Just following the herd. People make the money betting against these people
@observealot @MSmithsonPB more the fact thst so many gamblers are bad at it!
@jpeterjackson @MSmithsonPB to cut a long story short, I don't see how money could know best!
@jpeterjackson @MSmithsonPB I'd have thought entire principle of gambling was good gamblers (minority) beating bad ones (majority)
@jpeterjackson @MSmithsonPB if the majority of gamblers won, how would gambling exist as an industry?
@MSmithsonPB isnt the principle of gambling that most people lose?
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB most pioneering astro physicists/astronomers were devoutly religious as well.
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB truth is, both sides on Church/Science debate look for dividing lines.
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB even Einstein was religious.
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB most pioneering scientists were also religious you know. Newton, Capurnicous, Da Vinci etc
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB twas Europeans living in the dark ages. Not Islamic countries
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB I get point you're trying to make. But it's wrong. Muslims brought Science to Europe.
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB the first Islamic Scientific university opened 800 years before Newton was born!
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB Muslim physicists and mathematicians were around when Europeans were living in tribes, in huts
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution was basically started by Muslims!
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB Islamic countries had universities hundreds of years before Oxford and Cambridge was founded
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB virtually all of the early pioneering astronomers,mathmaticians and physicists were Muslims...
@HughdjNicklin @Smithy0364 @sp2a @MSmithsonPB you are literally  talking rubbish on this subject though
@HughdjNicklin @sp2a @MSmithsonPB although you genuinely do seem to hate all religion so, each to their own
@HughdjNicklin @sp2a @MSmithsonPB Hugh. You know Jews segregate by sex right? And Sikhs?  It's a religious thing. Not Islamic.
@HughdjNicklin @MSmithsonPB If you want minorities to engage with your party, the first trick is to respect their traditions.....
@HughdjNicklin @MSmithsonPB You mean Muslims have been holding segregated Labour meetings.
@tnewtondunn @KateEMcCann so you're telling us we should vote Tory AND Lib Dem AND SNP......lolz
@tnewtondunn @KateEMcCann I think you could argue this is the most desperate and pathetic The Sun has ever been though. Certainly
@tnewtondunn @KateEMcCann Not sure the Sun being desperate and pathetic is a world's first!
@CraigA_Ryan @paulwaugh If Clegg has no Lib Dem support in a safe Lib Dem seat how can he be legitimate leader?
@paulwaugh errr Dave. 90% of people who vote Lib Dem want a Labour coalition
@myNhood @tnewtondunn and the "ordinary" people are in one of the safest, most affluent Tory seats in country
@doylec909 @tnewtondunn yes. Facing the angry working classes of......Hendon. Brave
@tnewtondunn Hendon is hardly Manchester is it Tom!
@tnewtondunn "Genuine, ordinary people in the ultrasafe Tory seat of Hendon"
@jameschappers Boris needs to understand that people outside of South East and Wiltshire also get to vote.....
@jameschappers A nightmare for southern English people, yes, I agree. Probably
@stephenkb 1/2 Tories actually did quite a bit worse on named ballots, nationally. Libs and Labour did quite a bit better.
@stephenkb 1/2 Survation did a national poll Saturday, where they sent their sample, individual, named ballot papers for their constituency
@stephenkb Yougov interviews 7000 people a week for national poll. I doubt a constituency poll over 5 weeks will interview more than 3000
@stephenkb Constituency polls accurate? They're as accurate as a 3000-4000 sample over 5 weeks canbe. So not as accurate as national polling
@stephenkb Im saying it's an anamoly. A one off. Tories are voting tactically as they actually prefer Clegg to their own candidate
@stephenkb Secondly, Tory voters would always "reward" Clegg for ignoring his own voters and voting in all their policies.
@stephenkb Firstly. Clegg is an anamoly. Tories know it's vital he stays in power of Lib Dems for their own interests.
@stephenkb I'm hoping by 2030 professional political pundits learn how polling works. Or basic mathematics. What do you do all year?!
@iainmartin1 how can an illegitimate MP be deputy Prime Minister?
@iainmartin1 How can a man with no support from his own party, in Sheffield, lead the party?
@iainmartin1 I'm the opposite. Liked him 4 weeks ago. No respect for him now
@iainmartin1 well he's always known the Tory Press would push Tory votes his way hasn't he
@iainmartin1 apart from all the policies and political debate. You mean.
@frank_fisher @iainmartin1 @DPJHodges media suggesting you have to vote for establishment parties in Scot, for your vote to count in Eng?
@frank_fisher @iainmartin1 @DPJHodges and I'm English!
@frank_fisher @iainmartin1 @DPJHodges I'd argue the English media labelling patriotic Scots illegitimate, as constitutionally dangerous.
@iainmartin1 I'm not at all surprised many people don't bother voting. I probably won't myself on Thursday.
@iainmartin1 I'm not that easily shocked in regards to politics. I know how things are. But I've found this election pretty disgusting.
@iainmartin1 it's been interesting for Tory media I guess. Trying to lay the ground for an English populist coup. But not voters
@Steven_Swinford Boris needs to get used to SNP having a 40 seat anti-Tory voting block for the next 20 years after way they have behaved
@Steven_Swinford the saviour of The Tory Party....
@StigAbell Charlottes a popular name with commoners (Kate....I mean Katherine)
@StigAbell A Royal baby........ Called Diana? Did The Sun implode on itself?
@morralexand @martinboon @NCPoliticsUK @LordAshcroft big difference between how 800 random sample reacts to naming and 80'000....
@morralexand @martinboon @NCPoliticsUK @LordAshcroft I agree with not naming. Spring names on a small sample, you're guaranteeing outliers
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell either that or they purposefully put red herrings into web data to stop dorks like me releasing the poll. Bravo?
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell probably assuming no Sun readers know how to drill into web page data
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell the web code is basically saying 3/5/15 = 1% Tory lead. 4/5/15= 1% Tory lead. ....
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell web data is in code form before it's in website consumer form. 4/5/15 yougov poll says 1% Tory lead......
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell I think he's talking crap....I work for a search engine and used my code reading superpowers. I see a 1% Tory lead
@StigAbell Could Lib Dems even work with DUP? Clegg has no principles, obviously. But they're a democratic party. Not his choice.
@StigAbell Sun don't want to discuss that Tories will be propped up by DUP. A far right, anti abortion, anti birth control, anti gay party
@StigAbell Tories probably need more than Lib Dems mate! Libs will win 25 seats at most!
@SunNation @StigAbell the Sun BEGS people to vote tactically lol
@StigAbell remember in 1990s all young people read The Sun. Very hard to believe now
@StigAbell young people used to read The Sun a long time ago, you know......
@StigAbell lets be blunt. They don't want Levenson.
@StigAbell they're going to lose a lot of readers. They didn't have many anyway
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell going to be a tie or an outlier either way......
@MSmithsonPB @StigAbell an outlier then....
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP SKY trying to prepare ground for Cameron to squat in number 10 with no majority
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP definite English media agenda to create image that Nationlist Scots are illegitimate......
@CJuliaSM @adamboultonSKY @theSNP facists are right wingers dear. Left wingers want freedom for all
@iMichaelPowell @adamboultonSKY @theSNP you think Salmond is less popular than Clegg?
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP If SNP have 50 seats they won't be sitting on opposition benches.....
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP English media, including BEEB just have this endless agends of describing Scot votes as illegitimate
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP I realize English medias agenda is to paint Scots votes as illegitimate in their coup attempt but its not true
@adamboultonSKY @theSNP This English establishment narrative that Scots can't be on government bench is annoying
@EdBollox @bbcnickrobinson bearing in mind Tories and Labour have 33% each it's impossible......
@EdBollox @bbcnickrobinson if a party gets Queens speech through you have to vote their budget down by SEVENTY FIVE% to get new election
@EdBollox @bbcnickrobinson not with fixed term parliaments mate!
@preno67 @bbcnickrobinson @Ed_Miliband @rustyrockets your claims of bias are based on your own personal nerves and paranoia.
@preno67 @bbcnickrobinson @Ed_Miliband @rustyrockets come on Mike. I'm an 8 year Labour Party member and have always considered Nick neutral
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs BBC gleefully towing the Daily Mail line that only English votes count
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs Balls said biggest party had "first opportunity" not that they usually win!
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs not sure voters yet realize that BBC supporting Tory effort for populist English coup
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs massively biased for BBC to push Tory line that nationalist voters are illegitimate
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs Cam loses vote of confidence with no majority. Survives if SNP deemed "illegitimate"
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs Its your job to explain Parliamentary rules. Not support English populist coups
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs BritishBC pushing an attack line against legitimacy of Scottish voters is scandalous
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs and that SNP voters pay the exact same TV license as English voters do
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs Can I remind you that you work for the British Broadcasting Corporation.Not the English
@bbcnickrobinson @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @edballs BBC scarily willing to push the "Scottish Votes Are Illegitmate" Tory line #bias
@MSmithsonPB Its a sad indictment of the Lib Dems in coalition. Tories far happier with Clegg than Lib Dems
@MSmithsonPB Tories know Clegg is vital to Tory coalition. And probably also want to reward him for pushing through all the Tory policies!
@MSmithsonPB remember Hallam is also a very safe Lib Dem seat! And Labour still within 7%. Even with massive Tory support
@MSmithsonPB Tory voters know that without Clegh they're out of government
@MSmithsonPB Dont agree. Clegg is vital for Tories to win back power
@montie @LeifDavidsen @patrickwintour is Clegg a legitimate Lib Dem leader, if he only gets in with mostly Tory support?
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 I for one don't think Cameron is stupid enough not to resign. I suspect it's just hyperbole
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 PMs duty to parliament and Queen to do the right thing. As quickly as possible
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 imagine if Brown refused to budge for 3 weeks  said "vote me out! i don't think Lib Dem support is legitimate!"
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 PM are supposed to put counties interest ahead of their own. Letting the opposition form government if they cant
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 oh behave.....a PM with no hope of majority is endangering the entire country by staying on
@philipjcowley @Tubby_Isaacs @swimtwobirds @OwenJones84 a PM with no hope of majority resigns. He doesn't force voters to remove him....
@philipjcowley @Tubby_Isaacs @swimtwobirds @OwenJones84 our fragile constitution only works on the basis politicians follow rules
@philipjcowley @swimtwobirds @OwenJones84 @Tubby_Isaacs a coup is nonsense? It could happen mate
@philipjcowley @swimtwobirds @OwenJones84 @Tubby_Isaacs you don't seem to get that its not voters jobs to fight Tory PM and their media ..
@philipjcowley @swimtwobirds @OwenJones84 @Tubby_Isaacs any PM with no majority, relying on media to support him is mounting a coup
@philipjcowley @Tubby_Isaacs @OwenJones84 Its NOT voters job to make sure Prime Ministers and newspapers follow the rules. Its the pms!
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 An illegitimate prime minister squatting in office, with support of media is nothing more than a coup
@philipjcowley @OwenJones84 its not voters job to force a Prime Minister to do the honorable thing. Its his
@montie @philipjcowley @OwenJones84 any prime minister with any honour, or sense of duty, resigns if no majority
@montie @philipjcowley @OwenJones84 refusing to resign with no possible majority is endangering the UK and putting yourself ahead of country
@montie @philipjcowley @OwenJones84 when its a prime minister relying on English press to support his squat it's a very scary coup...
@montie @philipjcowley @OwenJones84 Philip. You and I know a Prime Minister squatting in number 10 with no majority is a coup....
@montie @OwenJones84 Tories/Media trying to paint none-English votes as "illegitimate" to save Cameron from no-confidence resignation? Scary
@montie @OwenJones84 Tim, a British Prime Minister cant govern with an English majority. He needs a UK majority
@louisetiger1 @montie you don't understand parliament. If Cameron can't find a majority he resigns. As Brown did.
@montie @OwenJones84 I'm quite sure you'd have huge riots and violence on the streets if Cameron tried to govern with no popular support
@montie @OwenJones84 Tory party/media are trying to paint Scots votes as illegitimate to suggest Cameron has confidence. But that's a coup
@montie @OwenJones84 A prime minister not being able to find a majority? Its a vote of no confidence. Hugely dishonorable to squat in no 10.
@montie @OwenJones84 to be fair Tim, if Cameron refused to resign with no majority, relying on English media support, it would be a coup
@MSmithsonPB so would Clegg have legitimacy as Deputy PM? Considering he has no support with his own voters?
@mcg1973 @MSmithsonPB different though. Naming Farage gets people to vote for him as they want him. Tories just voting to save coalition
@AbiolaHP @lasheroh @MSmithsonPB @NatBuster you're a comedian. Labours entire Scottish problem is not being rude enough to Tories
@dungra @MSmithsonPB Tories can't win without Clegg. New leader guaranteed to be left wing
@AbiolaHP @MSmithsonPB you're joking right.......if Libs tactically vote it will be against Tories mate!!
@nigeldevlin @MSmithsonPB errr they're thinking of themselves. They need Clegg as leader to get Lib Dem coalition
@MSmithsonPB What a terrible day for democracy though. Our Deputy MP could potentially have no party support in his  constituency!
@JeremyCliffe think he's just a bit too arrogant, unsympathetic, antagonistic to lead a party
@JeremyCliffe Javid is like Gove. Brilliant on paper. Then he opens his mouth
@LadPolitics @MSmithsonPB palace leak?
@patrickwintour I was a sceptic but namimg of candidates could be important. Tories seem to do worse in real ballot conditions, currently
@patrickwintour Tories actually did considerably  worse when all candidates are named on a ballot. Labour and Libs did a bit better
@patrickwintour latest Survation poll, they sent their 1000 sample ballot papers with the candidates names on.Tailored for each person
@JamesTapsfield Cliton was 20% ahead in the polls though when he played it!
@johnpmcdermott Like Gove, not very likeable. Too antagonistic
@johnpmcdermott he's like Michael Gove. Excellent on paper. Until he opens his mouth
@NM_Rdg @mousemadness100 @montie @CCHQPress if you don't want to work, long term, the social contract is that state shouldn't support it
@NM_Rdg @mousemadness100 @montie @CCHQPress but not even Tories are going to subsidize people who don't want to work!
@NM_Rdg @mousemadness100 @montie @CCHQPress if you choose not to work (and hence not pay tax) that's an individual decision
@NM_Rdg @mousemadness100 @montie @CCHQPress the state should make "not working" financially attractive?
@montie choosing not to work is a personal decision. Based on whether you can afford to. Shouldn't be subsidised by working mothers
@montie If I choose not to work, the state are not going to support it. Or make it attractive
@montie Tim. Choosing not to work should never be supported by the state.....
@LeifDavidsen @montie @patrickwintour said a few times, will be no winners in this election!
@LeifDavidsen @montie @patrickwintour they would then just pressure them into concessions with supply and demand. Before bringing them down
@LeifDavidsen @montie @patrickwintour Think Libs may vote through a Tory Queens speech. If Tories can find a majority
@LeifDavidsen @montie @patrickwintour I mean a coalition with the centre right. With no members, or councillors you cease to exist
@LeifDavidsen @montie @patrickwintour Lib Dems arguably wouldn't survive another coalition. Already lost 50% councillors. Lots of members
@montie Tories and Libs really need a majority of their own. Can't see anything else happening
@montie how could Libs work with DUP? Anti abortion, anti birth control, anti gay equality?
@montie do you think the Libs would even work with the DUP? A far right party? They're democratic. Clegg won't get to decide
@montie You're saying the Tories win 300? They're currently polling to lose at least net -30 from 2010. Could be 50.
@SidGuevara @bbclaurak @SkiverMacIver she's someone who suggests that as long as a party has a majority in England that's all that matters
@bbclaurak how could a coalition govern when most voters didn't want them in power? That's the entire point of a majority/democracy
@bbclaurak the BBC implying an English party could stay in power, with no British majority, as more people in England want them there? Coup.
@bbclaurak Cameron gets first "attempt" but if he can't find a majority it's a vote of no confidence and he should concede defeat and resign
@bbclaurak it's your job to inform voters on parliamentary rules and procedures. Not suggest nationalists are illegitimate
@bbclaurak have no idea why senior BBC pundits are joining in with The Sun in misleading voters on parliamentary legitimacy
@bbclaurak You are the British Broadcasting Corporation remember. Not the English Broadcasting Corporatio
@bbclaurak but it seems the British media are just doing the groundwork so that can happen
@bbclaurak if Cameron doesn't step aside with no majority, it will be one of the most dangerous, outrageous moments in recent memory
@bbclaurak you should be explaining to voters how parliament works. Not working the propaganda for a Tory/English populist coup attempt
@bbclaurak I do get alarmed at the British media establishment joining in on the demonization of nationalist MPs. Seems very biased
@bbclaurak If Cameron cant form a majority he steps aside. As Gordon Brown did. There's little more to it
@bbclaurak BBC should be informing voters on parliament. Not leading the "Scots are illegitimate" brigade.
@bbclaurak why are the BBC purposefully misleading voters on how parliament works? It's bordering on a populist English coup
@bbclaurak BBC should stay away from this "Scots are illegitimate" argument. You're the British Broadcasting Corporation. English Bias.
@Tent101 @bbclaurak Tories could govern with no majority. But couldn't bring in any Conservative policies. So what's the point?
@Tent101 @bbclaurak na. Tories can't govern with no majority. SNP/Labour would bring him down the minute he tried a Conservative Policy!
@bbclaurak If Cameron can't find majority, he resigns. Any attempts to stay, and block Labour, would be an effective English populist coup.
@bbclaurak BBC dutifully playing along to media attempts to keep Cameron in office, even though the majority of MPs and voters oppose him
@bbclaurak Tories trying to change narrative, so failure to find a majority is not a vote of no confidence as "scots don't count"
@bbclaurak Cameron will have first attempt to find a majority. If he can't it's a vote of no confidence and he should resign. As Brown did.
@bbclaurak medias job to inform voters on parliamentary rules. Not support a Tory media coup attempt.
@bbclaurak I'm not enjoying the media hinting at Scottish illegitimacy. It genuinely is in "coup" territory.
@redskydarkcloud @bbclaurak if Cameron can't form a majority he should really resign. And probably will
@redskydarkcloud @bbclaurak Tories can only stay in office if they can form a majority. So they need about 290 and Libs need about 25
@redskydarkcloud @bbclaurak well they lose if that happens....need to get 30-40 clear to have any hope of forming a majority
@bbclaurak a sneaky misquote I think. He said "normally gets first opportunity to form government"
@danwild02 @anandshukla200 @LeightonVW don't think voters yet know that DUP are to the right of UKIP.....
@danwild02 @anandshukla200 @LeightonVW Unsure how Libs could work with an anti-abortion, anti-birth control, anti-Gay equality party.
@danwild02 @anandshukla200 @LeightonVW cynical stuff though. DUP are much more right wing than UKIP!
@Mcfc1974VCC @LeightonVW @OwenJones84 @David_Cameron that's not saying there would be no deal though
@anandshukla200 @LeightonVW DUP are worse than UKIP surely. Much more right wing. Lib Dems shouldn't go near either
@LeightonVW @David_Cameron pretty cynical that Clegg has ruled out working with UKIP and SNP but not the worst of the lot, the DUP!
@LeightonVW @David_Cameron DUP are anti abortion,  anti birth control, anti gay equality right? How could Lib Dems work with them?
@LeightonVW @David_Cameron think Tories could get away with workinh with DUP but Lib Dems?!
@LeightonVW @David_Cameron other question is how could Lib Dems work with DUP?
@KateMaltby @FraserNelson segregation is often a condition of Muslims engaging in politics. They're just respecting that.
@KateMaltby @FraserNelson Labour win minority votes as they respect them. They don't see them as the enemy.
@KateMaltby @FraserNelson I just don't enjoy this "Labour are the party of Muslims" rhetoric the The Tory rags put out.
@Alex_Dinham @KateMaltby @montie @rustyrockets Labour have done well in polls since interview. No major boost but solidified vote
@Alex_Dinham @KateMaltby @montie @rustyrockets as in The Sun, Mail, Telegraph, David Cameron!
@Alex_Dinham @KateMaltby @montie @rustyrockets not as feeble minded as those who insisted a Brand interview would see Labour plummet inpolls
@OffencePolice @KateMaltby I think 20% voters love him and the other 80% don't care.
@OffencePolice @KateMaltby Labour have improved in the polls since the Brand interview. Many Tories saying they'd plummet...
@KateMaltby so ignorant as well Kate. Mosque traditions apply at all public events.
@KateMaltby are you not ashamed that most of the replies you get are from far right?
@KateMaltby the tone of this entire thing seem to be people getting offended by Muslims engaging in British politics
@KateMaltby @CllrMArif @PlashingVole @sue4walsallsth you are using broad terms "Labour rally" "Labour Organizers" to sensationalize
@KateMaltby @CllrMArif @PlashingVole @sue4walsallsth by "Labour Party" you probably mean the local Muslim community organization
@Nufanglenesse @KateMaltby @spectator and Muslims wouldn't engage in meetings or politics if their culture wasn't respected
@Nufanglenesse @KateMaltby @spectator I suspect Labour are simply respecting the culture of the people attending.
@KateMaltby @PlashingVole the spectator thinks its newsworthy as it involves Muslims. Plain old, decent, racism.
@KateMaltby @PlashingVole yes, Spectator write endless articles criticizing Jews don't they......
@KateMaltby @spectator @MrSteerpike aren't a meeting of British Muslims going to sit however they want? Labour shouldn't respect that?
@KateMaltby @spectator @MrSteerpike saddest bit is the The Tory media still resorting to these horrid dog/whistle, far right articles
@17thCenturyLady @KateMaltby @spectator sad that Muslim culture is respected?
@Nufanglenesse @KateMaltby @spectator @PlashingVole well, Jews and Sikhs also segregate. But that doesn't get the far right as angry
@tim_rigby @KateMaltby @spectator @MrSteerpike yes, Spectator write constant articles about Jewish/Sikh segregation.....
@KateMaltby @Saftar "the organisers" being the Muslim community leaders I suspect
@KateMaltby @Saftar you mean you gatecrashed a Muslim Labour Party meeting to get a dog/whistle story?
@Saftar @KateMaltby its plainly obvious that Muslims segregate themselves. For cultural reasons
@KateMaltby @spectator @MrSteerpike "segregated rally". She means a respectful meeting of Muslim Labour members
@KateMaltby @zoahms @OborneTweets @FraserNelson all public events follow Mosque rules. That's their culture
@KateMaltby @zoahms @OborneTweets @FraserNelson errrrrr if you're Muslim/Orthodox you're always in holy place. Under eyes of god....
@KateMaltby @zoahms @OborneTweets @FraserNelson dog/whistle, far right, jingoism at its worst
@KateMaltby @CaroleBristol @FraserNelson @OwenJones84 why have Spectator never wrote an article about segregation at synagogues then?
@KateMaltby @CaroleBristol @FraserNelson @OwenJones84 dog/whistle, far right, jingoism at its worst
@KateMaltby by "segregated rallies" you mean a meeting of Muslim voters in a Mosque
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby Labour respecting the culture of Muslims, and other minorities, is why they get their votes
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby women and men sit apart in certain types of building in Islam as it's their culture over the last 1500 years
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby the Spectator should be embarrassed about resorting to far-right jingoism
@melindiscott @FraserNelson @KateMaltby @BBCNews errr.....maybe the Nazi News at 5 will cover it
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby Tories going "far right" on Muslims is why no minorities vote for you
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby did you ever consider the men/women there asked to be seated in this way? As it's a Mosque?
@FraserNelson @KateMaltby ahhh the last desperate throw of dice of the Tory political pundit. Dog/Whistle far-right jingoism
@stuartmillar159 @FraserNelson Tories spending 24 hours of energy on this is example of why they won't win majorities. Nobody cares
@ChrisGiles_ @MarkGregoryEY the view of sustainability is a political one. Not an economic one. There is a big difference
@ChrisGiles_ @jdportes all parties say it's too high as economical prudence is a vote winner, post crash
@ChrisGiles_ @jdportes Chris. Again. You are unable to differentiate between politics and economics
@ChrisGiles_ @jdportes low deficits/surplasses after a crash are politically attractive. Not economicallly
@ChrisGiles_ @jdportes Chris, you can't differentiate the politics of economics and actual economics.......
@ChrisGiles_ @jdportes @sjwrenlewis errr because it's politically popular. Not because it's economically literate
@MatthewBayley @ChrisGiles_ so did George Osborne. He wanted to increase spending even more than Brown
@ChrisGiles_ @FraserNelson if it was disastrously wrong fiscal policy in 2007 then Mrs Thatchers entire time in office was fiscal disaster
@ChrisGiles_ @FraserNelson but 46% of GDP is what we had borrowed for previous 40 years?
@ChrisGiles_ @FraserNelson Fraser's dodgy graph gets exposed so he goes searchinh for old tweets to back him up!
@FraserNelson @jdportes how many surplasses did Thatcher and Major run in the boom years Fraser?
@FraserNelson @jdportes Australia/Sweden are exporters of Gas, oil, metals, minerals. Huge natural resources
@FraserNelson @jdportes it makes no economic sense whatsoever Fraser. Only political sense.
@FraserNelson @drjennings @jdportes Australia has huge amounts of coal, oil, minerals, metals and gas. That's only reason it did well
@FraserNelson @drjennings @jdportes Labour ran surpluses
@FraserNelson purposefully using "cash terms"  instead of % of GDP. And then ending it at 2010 so you can't see a continued rise! Haha
@MattBluefoot @algwars @FraserNelson no. The spectator put out crank statistics like this virtually every day!
@FraserNelson yours is purposefully a cash terms graph. Debt rising naturally with inflation. In GDP terms debt was lower in 2007
@FraserNelson no Fraser. Your graph is utterly dishonest and misleading. Its a graph of "cash term" debt. Not a % of GDP!
@nicholaswatt @Paulscriven @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @LibDems we can presume he's unnamed as he's Tory
@nicholaswatt @Paulscriven @nick_clegg @David_Cameron @LibDems the "source" being Michael Gove I imagine!
@MSmithsonPB all Labour will say is "here is our Queens speech/bill/law. Vote how you want".  SNP could never bring them down
@MSmithsonPB SNP and Labour agree on most things. All Labour have to do is put out left wing policies......how could SNP vote down?
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB even Gordon Brown resigned pretty quickly when it was apparent he couldn't form a majority. After all!
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB it's pretty dishonorable and cheap to try and stay in when you don't have confidence of parliament.
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB when it comes to the crunch I think Cam would resign, with no majority. Tory hyperbole is maybe to boost morale
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB if he squatted in number 10 and forced opposition to vote him out it would be very rare and quite dishonorable
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB failing to secure a majority is a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister and he should resign.
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB Prime Minister's rarely resign after losing Queens speech as they're supposed to resign well before then
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB which is probably reason Labour have taken such a position
@SpinningHugo @MSmithsonPB not sure you're right. My reading of law is no parties actually need to make deals any more.
@CurlyMan66 @themerchent @MSmithsonPB @michaelsavage @YouGov they haven't won here since 1997. Wealthy, Lib Dem area
@CurlyMan66 @themerchent @MSmithsonPB @michaelsavage @YouGov Labour wil probably win in my marginal constituency. Bristol City Centre
@themerchent @MSmithsonPB @michaelsavage @YouGov It could well happen mates. But polling is about following facts. Wherever they lead you
@themerchent @CurlyMan66 @MSmithsonPB @michaelsavage @YouGov you realize most of your friends and colleagues will be quite like yourself!
@hendopolis what you're looking at, arguably, is a coup attempt by Tories and their media. To rewrite parliament. Very dangerous and scary
@hendopolis Tory press are trying to build populist opinion against legitimacy of none-English MPs so Cameron doesn't have to resign
@hendopolis  system is that if the PM can't command majority, he resigns, and Milliband is asked by Queen to form best government he can
@hendopolis ToryPress are trying to argue that Cameron shouldnt resign,as Scottish MPs are illegitimate, so there isn't a no confidence vote
@hendopolis If Cameron can't form majority he has to resign. As its a vote of no confidence in the PM.
@eigenscape @hendopolis @SamCoatesTimes Tories were a minority last time. Relied on Lib Dem and DUP votes
@hendopolis Tory press are only trying to create a toxic atmosphere around Scottish MPs, as it may help Cameron survive. A coup if you will
@geertwilderspvv When a far right racist group is hosting the event, I'm not sure I believe the "free speech" angle.
@danrafaelespn agree. No rematches please. Manny was way out of his depth
@RealSkipBayless everyone knows Skip is going to spend the next decade promoting Arums phony, "injury" cry baby excuses
@RealSkipBayless why? As you have no character, self respect, and you're not a man
@RealSkipBayless everyone knows you're going to spend the next decade talking about cry baby, phony "injury" excuses
@RealSkipBayless Skip cant seem to tell the difference between punches and swinging at air?
@RealSkipBayless Skip. Does it worry you  that things you see aren't actually happening?  It should
@RealSkipBayless Skip seems to think everyone is insane but him. The thought process of a lunatic....
@RealSkipBayless he won the last 6 rounds easily!
@RealSkipBayless I doubt Manny won any round after 6. He was finished
@RealSkipBayless when skip CAPITALISES words its because even he knows its bullshit
@RealSkipBayless in the crazy world that is inside your head....in real life he was 4-5 rounds down
@RealSkipBayless hahaha stop it. He was showboating!
@RealSkipBayless Manny was finished after 9 rounds.
@RealSkipBayless notice how Skip already knew his score was ridiculous so got his conspiracy theories in as wekl
@RealSkipBayless if you genuinely think that happened I'd see a therapist Skip. As its fantasy
@RealSkipBayless haha yeah.......skip isnt biased at all
@RealSkipBayless I can't find any pundit or website that gave Manny more than 4 rounds
@RealSkipBayless unfortunately Skip, the only people who believe this are you and Manny
@RealSkipBayless now it's obvious Mannys nowhere near Floyds class are you still going to hype him up?
@RealSkipBayless do you even watch? I'm not sure you bother. Bet you wrote these tweets on Thursday!
@RealSkipBayless skip. You get points when you land shots. Its not that complicated
@RealSkipBayless substance? Swinging and missing?
@RealSkipBayless what boxer has ever won a fight landing under 100 shots? He landed 81!
@RealSkipBayless only you love Manny more than himself Skip
@RealSkipBayless seriously. Were you watching? Manny didn't do anything in last 2 rounds. Gassed
@RealSkipBayless are you even watching? Pacquiao was finished by round 10!
@RealSkipBayless imagine whats going through his head. His hero getting schooled by the guy he hates most.....ouch
@RealSkipBayless by theatrics you mean hitting a guy and not getting hit yourself... .ie. Boxing
@RealSkipBayless Pacquiao only landed 81 scoring shots. He was lucky to get more than 3 rounds
@RealSkipBayless I'm just waiting for Skip to start using Arums phony crybaby "injury" excuses for the next 15 years at least
@RealSkipBayless Landing 81 shots is not being aggresive. It's being a clueless boxer out of their depth
@RealSkipBayless Being aggressive and not landing shots actually loses you points. Numb nuts
@RealSkipBayless errr sorry to be blunt, but by aggressor they mean the guy who lands punches.......
@RealSkipBayless who taught you that? Are you sure they weren't on crack?
@RealSkipBayless Mayweather threw more punches going backwards than Manny did going forwards. What great fighters do
@greetandtweet @RealSkipBayless Floyd threw more punches going backwards than Manny did going forwards
@RealSkipBayless he got away with schooling him, as Manny isnt very good?
@RealSkipBayless everyone knows Skip is going to push Arums phony excuses about "injuries" for the next decade at least
@brockgriffin1 @RealSkipBayless skip ensured people Manny would knock Floyd out in 3 rounds etc etc haha
@brockgriffin1 @RealSkipBayless Skip has talked absolute BS about Pacquiao for 7-8 years
@RealSkipBayless he should have won? With his 81 shots. ......haha
@RealSkipBayless bringing up phony injuries, only after you lose, is the most unclassy, scummy thing a boxer can do
@RealSkipBayless by classy do you mean making up phony injuries as he's not man enough to acceot a loss?
@RealSkipBayless hahaha. Ever get the feeling Skip makes a lot of money out of Asia?
@RealSkipBayless Skip. If you land 81 punches you're never going to win.....hahaha
@SWAGDAD80 @RealSkipBayless Manny wasn't throwing shots as he was getting backed up on the counter. He was worried about taking a big one
@SWAGDAD80 @RealSkipBayless he probably could have knocked him out. He hurt him a few times
@Just_Justin8 @RealSkipBayless 81 punches hahaha!
@RealSkipBayless awwee Skip. Did your hero lose?
@MooralWrane @RealSkipBayless Manny had to be competitive to get a rematch. No way people would pay to see it again
@RealSkipBayless you're talking about round 3 and 4. When Manny in theory was still in the fight. He wasn't by round 6!
@RealSkipBayless how can anyone possibly even think that fight was even very close?
@RealSkipBayless you're such a troll haha
@BuffLlama @RealSkipBayless he thought Manny would be too fast for Floyd hahaha
@RealSkipBayless sure youve come up with numerous new theories to defend yourself. But must be embarrassing for you. Talking BS for 7 years!
@RealSkipBayless anyone with a brain knew Manny would get nowhere near Mayweather. He couldn't beat Marquez!
@RealSkipBayless who didn't think Pacquiao would have at least 3 excuses when he lost?!
@RealSkipBayless everyone knows you're just going to promote your friend Arum's pre planned conspiracy theories
@RealSkipBayless there was no injury. Roach, Arum and Pacquiao just have no class whatsoever
@RealSkipBayless obvious  that as soon as Pacquiao lost they'd have some pre planned excuse. And rely on guys like you to promote it
@RealSkipBayless Skip. Do you think anyone thought Team Pacquiao or their fans would lose with any dignity?
@RealSkipBayless you mean you're going to repeat Arum/Roaches lie endlessly to protect your heros reputation
@SamCoatesTimes you mean you continue try and paint Scottish votes as illegitimate to help Cameron try and survive. Coup
@SamCoatesTimes Make no mistake, the Tories and their press are pushing for a coup. Ignoring 600 years of parliamentary rules
@SamCoatesTimes they hope Cameron could then survive until Queens speech and hope the SNP Labour majority split.
@SamCoatesTimes Tory press trying to paint Scots as illegitimate so "no majority" would not be a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister
@SamCoatesTimes current rules are Cameron has to resign with no majority. As its a vote of no confidence in the PM.
@SamCoatesTimes Tory press are manouvering to try and keep Cameron in government even with no majority.
@SamCoatesTimes come on Sam. Tory press are trying to paint Scots as illegitimate. I doubt anyone in Labour does
@SamCoatesTimes @OldHopost Labour are currently polling to have more seats Sam....projections aren't based on polling
@SamCoatesTimes if Cameron can't form majority it will be Labour and SNPs constitutional duty to form a government
@SamCoatesTimes I think that's the image the Tory press are trying to promote. Illegitimate Scots. Doubt its true
@SamCoatesTimes @EdConwaySky incredibly dangerous trying to rewrite 600 years of constitution. Arguably a coup.
@SamCoatesTimes @EdConwaySky press trying to paint Scots as illegitimate so Cameron can avoid resignation. Saying they don't count
@SamCoatesTimes @EdConwaySky Cameron can't form a majority its a vote of no confidence and he resigns.
@SamCoatesTimes @EdConwaySky Cameron can't form a majority, it's Labours constitutional duty to do so. And SNPs
@SamCoatesTimes @EdConwaySky whoever can form a majority, it's their duty to govern. Press trying to mislead people on that
@SamCoatesTimes but make no mistake, Tories/press are trying to secure his survival even if he has no majority. A coup
@SamCoatesTimes if Cameron doesn't resign if he fails to gain confidence of parliament (majority) would be a constitutional crisis
@SamCoatesTimes Cameron would have to resign if he can't form a majority. Tories/press are trying to save him from that.
@SamCoatesTimes Media trying to paint Scottish MPs as illegitimate so Cameron can survive with no majority. A coup.
@SamCoatesTimes it's arguably a populist coup, attempt. Let's be honest. By Cameron and the Tory media.
@MSmithsonPB @SamCoatesTimes Tories are 40 ahead of Labour currently. But if they lost 40 seats to Lab, they would be 40 seats behind them.
@MSmithsonPB @SamCoatesTimes every time Labour win a sear from Tories, they lose one. So net gain of 2 seats
@NickOrmerod @1jamiefoster how many players are black? 50%? how many are coaches are black? 1%?
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB @M0djadji grow up Nick.
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB your vested intetest is to criticise anyone bringing bad Tory news as you don't want to read it....
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB these are just the numbers. Whether you like them or not.
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB Tories led Labour by 10% in England in 2010 election. They were 1% behind yesterday
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB don't blame him for your own jittery paranoia
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB @Phoenixarc I suspect you genuinely think the BBC is very biased as well. When it's just reporting events....
@NickOrmerod @MSmithsonPB @Phoenixarc I suspect the truth is Tories tend to be more territorial and paranoid.....
@Phoenixarc @MSmithsonPB he's an ex Lib Dem candidate. And this is a nonepolitical site
@guardian_sport @seaningle praising the deserved conquerer of an Asian hero drives away a heck of a lot of Asian web traffic
@guardian_sport @seaningle bearing in mind your coverage is exact opposite as all other titles you have to assume decision is commercial
@rashidkhan_6 @guardian_sport @seaningle no offense Rashid but these trolly articles are designed to attract people who hate him
@rashidkhan_6 @guardian_sport @seaningle apart from fighting almost every great fighter of his era?
@mckenzieg2 @guardian_sport @seaningle well not if youre a pacfan. He lost
@guardian_sport @seaningle your entire coverage is lying about the result of a legacy fight then slagging off the winner.....!
@guardian_sport @seaningle and you had the nerve to criticize the Telegraph for tailoring editorial decisions around Commercial interests?
@guardian_sport @seaningle seems obvious to me that the purpose of your fight coverage has been to attract the huge Asian web click market
@guardian_sport @seaningle Guardian, isnt it about time to admit you've tailored your fight coverage for commercial reasons?
@guardian_sport @seaningle your coverage consists of a bizarre "controversial decision" headline and 3 Mayweather attack articles.....
@seaningle the commercial interests being, criticizing Pacquiao drives away Asian web clicks. And attacking Mayweather attracts them
@seaningle wish Guardian would come clean and admit they're editing their boxing articles based on commercial/advertising interests
@seaningle then followed up the hilarious "controversial points decision" with several articles slagging Mayweather off
@seaningle love how Guardian have changed their articles from "dominat mayweather" to the hilarious "controversial points decision"....
@seaningle love it how Guardian has shifted it's coverage from "dominant mayweather" to the ridiculous "controversial points decision"!
@JGForsyth Tories will get some boost I think. But surge is a big word. I'm talking 2-3%
@JGForsyth second problem. Lord Ashcrofts own costituency polls show no first term incumbancy factor
@JGForsyth first problem. Tories have been behind in 4 of the 6 polls since Question Time. They've slipped back a bit
@Lolc63 @davidaxelrod @adamboultonSKY isn't Tories wasting time on subjects nobody really cares about the story of the election?
@BornLondoner @davidaxelrod @jimbo77767 "we"? You know Labour are polling higher in England than Tories!
@Lolc63 @davidaxelrod @adamboultonSKY say all core Tories.......
@therealitygap @davidaxelrod say all core Tories......you mean the Tory psyche. I doubt Labour are chasing those votes
@EastUpper3 @davidaxelrod @adamboultonSKY According to The Daily Mail. But they only get about 200 votes unfortunately
@Josephjthrush @davidaxelrod @MSmithsonPB to whom? Those who study campaigns closely? 2% of nation
@andrewpclark @davidaxelrod to whom? Those who diskike Labour anyway? None event
@TonyEmmerson @davidaxelrod to whom? The 0.5% of nation who care?
@MSmithsonPB symbolically though I think they'll want more than 50.
@MSmithsonPB remember they've never won more than 11......even 40 would be staggering
@adamboultonSKY @MSmithsonPB @SkyNewsTonight @michaelthrasher most projections are 50% polling 50% guesswork
@adamboultonSKY @MSmithsonPB @SkyNewsTonight @michaelthrasher if it was based on polling data Labour should have most seats in a projection
@adamboultonSKY @MSmithsonPB @SkyNewsTonight @michaelthrasher well Tories have only had 1 poll lead in the last 6 polls?
@arinakabob @leastalive @MSmithsonPB odd election where there is no popular, likeable party .......
@arinakabob @leastalive @MSmithsonPB also would you be more embarrassed about being Cameron fan or Ed? Probably even!
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley  they may vote in Labnow just to escape the environmentalism!
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley he's put in very radical green/Lib policies. Really unpopular
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley but genuinely think Lib Mayor has ruined your chances now
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley actually thought you might hold Bristol. Even with the students
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley also city Mayor is ex Lib. And basically put in a Lib agenda
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley seat really has gone sharply left in last years. Almost socialist
@JoshDixonTweets @jonnyboy_25 @MSmithsonPB @DanielMRussell @philipjcowley not liking your chances in Bristol living in the constituency
@yatesyman @MSmithsonPB @May2015NS so Labour could lose every seat in Scotland and still be largest party if they take enough Tory seats
@yatesyman @MSmithsonPB @May2015NS Tory to Labour swing counts double. A net 2 seat gain for every 1 seat won
@cammybaillie @MSmithsonPB major principle of gambling is the majority of stakes lose....
@cammybaillie @MSmithsonPB when's the last time you saw a rich gambler?
@MSmithsonPB me too. Some come across more as "guessing" than analysis of data. I go where the facts lead me!
@historyscientis @Drew_R_Pearce @KrustyAllslopp @MSmithsonPB pooling polling data is the closest you will get to predicting result
@historyscientis @Drew_R_Pearce @KrustyAllslopp @MSmithsonPB market theory is the further away you are from equilibrium, wronger you are!
@historyscientis @Drew_R_Pearce @KrustyAllslopp @MSmithsonPB individual polls that are closest to poll of polls should be right. Or rightest
@historyscientis @Drew_R_Pearce @KrustyAllslopp @MSmithsonPB disagree. Game theory and economic principle are completely based on pooling
@MSmithsonPB @Chav68898982 @oflynnmep wouldnt amaze me if they were underpolling or overpolling!
@MSmithsonPB @Chav68898982 @oflynnmep UKIP are 3rd biggest party now though Mike, remember. Very hard to poll with tactical voting
@SporadicInsight @MSmithsonPB Tories and Labour would do even worse out of PR. Especially Tories. They'll not fancy it
@jamesoleary2020 @MSmithsonPB in 2015 they could be both  trying to govern with only 41% of national vote!
@jamesoleary2020 @MSmithsonPB 36% in 2010. But Libs had 21%. So between them 57%
@Nickesanderson @andrew_kitching @MSmithsonPB sort of agree with the above. If Tories only 2% ahead in England could lose 40+ seats
@Nickesanderson @andrew_kitching @MSmithsonPB comparing a Scottish poll, to a UK poll, by different companies is recipe for disaster
@Nickesanderson @andrew_kitching @MSmithsonPB but this poll isnt suggesting they lose 40+ in Scotland.
@MSmithsonPB these projection guys tend to just tell newspapers what they want to hear. Kellner included
@MSmithsonPB I think its absolutely impossible for Tories to even win 285 on a 1% lead. Let alone 290+....
@MSmithsonPB haha not sure about that Prof
@vic_sez @GMLidington @roadto326 @MSmithsonPB @RosaPrinceUK   ask enough people to guess something, then take the average = correct answer
@vic_sez @GMLidington @roadto326 @MSmithsonPB @RosaPrinceUK Wisdom of crowds is a quirky maths theory that is actually true
@MSmithsonPB named after "wisdom of the crowds". A strange mathematical theory. That is actually true
@bendirs1 @gdewilson also remember Floyd legitimately fights injured almost every time. He has terrible back and hand issues
@bendirs1 @gdewilson boxers coming out with phony injury stories to rebuild their pride is just embarrassing
@bendirs1 @gdewilson Manny didn't even say anything about injuries post fight. He was saying he won easily!
@bendirs1 @gdewilson seriously think Manny told Nevada he had no injuries.But was secretely hiding one. And only revealed it day after loss?
@bendirs1 @gdewilson Pundits give Manny a really easy ride. Boxers claiming they are injured 8 hours after a fight is what David Haye did!
@BBCSport a trophy every 150 million spent
@duke_aljh @BBCSport @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao probably not the hearts of gay people. He's a famous bigot/homophobe
@FPL_Fly @BBCSport @FloydMayweather err you mean boxing? Have you never seen footwork before? Its considered a positive
@GarethADaviesDT bleating about phony, mystery, fake injuries when you lose. Well they should have more respect for opponent.
@GarethADaviesDT bad losers tend to make excuses only after they lose. Especially if losing to Floyd Mayweather
@GarethADaviesDT you'd be destroying Mayweather if he used injury excuses to cover up a loss to Pacquiao!
@GarethADaviesDT Come off itm You mean, he claimed he was injured only  after he lost as its an excuse
@GarethADaviesDT @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather @Telegraph This will be ranked alongside David Hayes broken toe in bad loser stakes!
@GarethADaviesDT @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather @Telegraph don't give out injections to anyone as they're considered a performance enhancer
@GarethADaviesDT @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather @Telegraph Manny just showed up an hour before and asked for a pain killer!
@GarethADaviesDT @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather @Telegraph you have to report legit injuries to Nevada so they can check they're legit
@GarethADaviesDT @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather @Telegraph he was denied an injection as he had no injury........
@djshrope @GarethADaviesDT more like a pathetic excuse as soon as he loses....David Haye style
@orangerose @esquire Arum probably had this injury story ready months ago. You probably wrote this weeks ago!
@orangerose @esquire Arum and pro-Manny jourmalists spreading phony, injury excuse stories. The moment he lost. Pretty predictable......
@orangerose what now? Vice president?
@orangerose @esquire they don't give injections to none-injured fighters as they're considered as performance enhancing
@orangerose @esquire as in, they wouldn't give him an injection as he never reported an injury. As it probably never happened
@orangerose @esquire Arums blatantly come up with an excuse. Then fed it to journalists close to him to spread...
@orangerose @esquire I'd like to say I expected more from Manny than phony excuses. But I'm not sure I did.
@orangerose @esquire a boxer claiming injury only after the lose is like Russell Wilson blaming the super bowl loss on a headache
@orangerose @esquire if Manny won you'd be calling it "fight of the century!!!!" no matter what happened
@GarethADaviesDT @orangerose @MannyPacquiao little more pathetic in boxing than bleating about phony injuries as soon as you lose
@GarethADaviesDT @orangerose @MannyPacquiao Manny just gets an easy ride from media as he has a lot of fans
@GarethADaviesDT @orangerose @MannyPacquiao if floyd had made excuses about injuries after he lost he'd have been laughed out of building
@GarethADaviesDT @orangerose @MannyPacquiao you shouldn't be giving half your Telegraph article to phony David Haye post fight injuries...
@fightingwords2 especially when its a phony made up excuse
@br_uk Pacquiao is letting himself down. This is the classless response you'd expect from Mayweather
@br_uk any boxer claiming injury 8 hours after he's already lost has no self respect. It's David Haye territory!
@br_uk haha pathetic excuse. Surprised you're demeaning yourself, Bleacher Report?
@ABSCBNNews haha great excuse. Man up Manny
@latimespugmire hahaha great excuse. Like David Hayes broken toe
@INQUIRERSports because he had no injury. You've got to prove it to get shots. They're considered PEDs in boxing
@trboxing hahaha great excuse Top Rank. Up there with David Haye and his broken toe
@danroan everyone knew weasels like Roach and Arum would have excuses ready months ago. No class in defeat
@cockneygreen65 @danroan @BBCSport Manny could only expect rematch if he challenged Floyd. He didnt. Nobody wants it again
@JuRen604 @danroan he owns Mannys ass though. Forever
@danroan Not sure fans believe post loss injury claims!
@ChrisMannixSI to get Manny another huge PPV they have to rebuild his rep. What phony injury excuses are
@ChrisMannixSI why's Roach saying hes in the best shape of his career before fight. And training was perfect?
@ChrisMannixSI dont get me wrong, i think Mayweather would come out with a phony injury claim if he got beaten easily
@ChrisMannixSI haha here comes the most predictable bit.....the post loss injury excuse
@ChrisMannixSI pundits shouldn't be giving these excuses the time of day. He'd never have fought Mayweather if he wasnt in great shape
@MATT_Chew90 @ChrisMannixSI I suspect they came up with their excuses months ago
@ChrisMannixSI they cant hand out painkillers with no evidencs of injury. They're considered PEDs in boxing
@ChrisMannixSI no they weren't. Were only told 2 hours before fight. And they decided he wasnt injured so didn't give him it
@ChrisMannixSI Arum is obviously making it up as he goes along......excuses
@chenriquez__ @ChrisMannixSI Kobes was a real injury. Not the fake boxinh excuse type
@ChrisMannixSI you see you cant play basketball with a rotator cuff injury.....but you can box?! Such a lame, fake, Arum excuse
@nateleeknight @ChrisMannixSI Kobe had a real injury. That stopped him playing. Fake injuries to try and get your balls back are different
@OGSportBlueVIs @ChrisMannixSI they never said. I'd guess its "fakeinjuryitis"
@ChrisMannixSI if it was any other fighter you'd be laughing at this . awful excuses!
@brunnodangelo @ChrisMannixSI MMA fighters earn 590 bucks a bout. And a free buffet dinner for a knockout
@ChrisMannixSI phony injury excuses are as low as you get in boxing. Dissapointed in Manny
@WaltelWhite @ChrisMannixSI he's a terrible bigot for example. Racist, sexist, homophobe....abuses gay people constantly
@WaltelWhite @ChrisMannixSI Mannys as big a scumbag as Floyd. Media just don't report it
@frkshw32 @ChrisMannixSI its impossible for rich people to be jailed in Pinoy
@ChrisMannixSI Very dissapointed in the lack of class shown by Manny and the media to be honest. Bad losers
@Pete_Chilcutt @ChrisMannixSI who brings up an injury 8 hours after youve lost. Other than David Haye!
@Pete_Chilcutt @ChrisMannixSI the injury obviously never existed
@Buflo_dolla @ChrisMannixSI that's Chris' second excuse. The first being the phony injury
@VIP_BlazeItUp @ChrisMannixSI come on. Terrible excuses
@ChrisMannixSI so Chris has 2 excuses he's sticking with. A phony injury and that a 38 year old Mayweather had an age advantage!
@WitMiBBall @ChrisMannixSI is that excuse number 2?
@ChrisMannixSI you're not questioning a hilarious injury excuse as its Manny Pacquiao. And criticizing him aint good business
@tariqnasheed well they're making lousy excuses
@Sports5PH haha David Haye!
@BBCSport come on Manny. Have some self respect. David Haye reveals injuries after he loses!
@BBCSport haha. Manny only waits 10 hours after his loss to get out his excuses
@NathanMilligan1 @bendirs1 @BBCSport Manny didn't challenge him so he cruised. Not being challenged by all time greats is genius territory
@NathanMilligan1 @bendirs1 @BBCSport it was a medicore fight as it was an easy fight (for Floyd)
@Peadletipper @bendirs1 promoters trick. To pretend Manny has that much left after big loss
@Peadletipper @bendirs1 Manny didn't even mention it post fight. Only came out the next day
@Peadletipper @bendirs1 well, considering it's basically made up, no!
@bendirs1 it was a mediocre fight as it was an easy fight. Manny didn't challenge him
@bendirs1 you were expecting Pacfans to be gracious in defeat? To Floyd Mayweather?!
@BBCSport anyone who knows Arum and Roach should know they probably had an injury excuse ready months ago
@BBCSport haha great excuse. We all knew it was coming
@PEPalerts haha great excuse
@rapplerdotcom @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather everyone knew they'd have a lame excuse ready
@rapplerdotcom @MannyPacquiao @FloydMayweather breakinh news....losing boxer makes up excuse
@ITVSport everyone knew they'd come out with some excuse. And it was probably going to be a phony injury
@ITVSport anyone who knows Roach knows he'll never give an opponent credit. Let alone Floyd! He's a lying weasel
@ITVSport come on. Roach and Pacquiao woukd have had this excuse ready for months
@BleacherReport youre only allowed an injection when you have an actual injury and report it....
@IAMSHIZZ @DomZenga @mjordon4 he had a minor camp injury. As all boxers do. Now he's using it to try and get his balls back
@DDove02 @DomZenga @mjordon4 he wasnt allowed a shot as he never reported an injury. Because there never was one
@DomZenga @mjordon4 well it didn't. That's what an excuse is
@BleacherReport Like all great losers, Manny comes out with injury excuse only after he lost
@PaulMalignaggi @tastelessjack but if you didn't think Roach/Arum had an excuse ready if they lost you don't know boxing
@PaulMalignaggi @tastelessjack lying about injuries keeps Manny slightly more relevant. Maybe buys him a few more PPV fights
@PaulMalignaggi @tastelessjack the facts being that he had a minor injury a 5 weeks ago that he's using to try and reclaim his balls
@DRUDGE_REPORT look no way Arum or Roach are ever going to allow Floyd have any credit. Like the weasels they are, they bitch and excuse
@DRUDGE_REPORT you need to put "injured" in the quote marks
@SBNation Manny has just gone down in my estimations. Not only is he not the fighter I thought he was, but he's not the man either
@SBNation you'd be destroying Mayweather if he resorted to injury excuses. It's what David Haye does!
@SBNation The fact that SBnation are taking the injury excuse seriousky should tell you what a biased, downmarket trashy site it is
@theScore have some self respect Manny. Take your loss like a man
@theScore god. Mannys doing a David Haye. Blaming a loss on a phony injury!
@curateit_feeds oh my god. Manny isnt doing a David Haye is he and blaming a loss on a phony injury! Have some self respect Manny
@SportsCenter anyone who knows Pacquiaos scummy group knows he was coming out with phony injuries the minute he lost
@SportsCenter Pacquiao has no class. I'm not even sure Floyd would resort to making up injuries, if he lost!
@FunnyThingsUK na. He'll be remembered as the champion who beat Pacquiao easily
O@jessicabrevelle @JaimePrimak if you thought Manny ever had a chance you're crazy. Blame the media for misleading you
@trelenah @JaimePrimak they're both world famous scumbags. Pacquiao has done and said terrible things
@trelenah @JaimePrimak you know Pacquiao is a world famous bigot right? Hates women, gays, the lot!
@F1abraham they're friends you idiot
@JaimePrimak the best man always wins. That's what "best'" means
@Charli24_07 Ali ran from Foreman in 1974! Clueless
@TroyBarnies7 Floyd isn't the guy cheating on his wife with TV presenters and calling gay people "disgusting scum who should burn in hell'
@TroyBarnies7 errr Mannys cheated on his wife numerous times. And is a world famous bigot
@SiphileHlwatika Mayweather pays his taxes?
@Hristo79 @MikeTyson errr Ali ran away from Foreman.
@ChetotAko @FloydMayweather he's obviously just some random fan who is very emotional about Pacquiao losing
@Casstrophobic @ChetotAko @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao easiest money ever!
@Casstrophobic @BoytoBadAzz his father once used Floyds as a human shield when he was 10. When drug dealers tried to kill him
@Casstrophobic @BoytoBadAzz he can't read or write. He grew up in as much poverty as Pacquiao
@ChetotAko @FloydMayweather Brendan Hiner....a very famous pundit. ...oh wait, he's just a random lunatic Pacquiao fan
@djjazzyd @FloydMayweather awww did your hero lose? Man up and stop bitching
@clairetheledge @WillHillBet @MannyPacquiao gambling is the Asian national sport. They're trying to get business
@WillHillBet @MannyPacquiao William Hill trying to get some Asian web hits #suck #ups
@djjazzyd strange quote by the way. Seeing as Ali ran from Foreman!
@djjazzyd awww did your hero lose? #manup #bitch
@LaytonWilliams Pacquiao fans are horrible losers.....
@LaytonWilliams "gays are disgusting scum. They will all burn in hell". Manny Pacquiao
@LaytonWilliams Errr Pacquiaos a massive homophobe who regularly abuses gay people, gay rights, and says he wants them all to burn in hell?
@SwiftifiedSwift Mayweathers not a gay-hating, disgusting, homophobe?
@SwiftifiedSwift one of them pays his taxes?
@shrunken_kudou he didn't even do a good job
@shrunken_kudou he lost all his belts haha #champion
@darianaquino @MannyPacquiao yeah...when you lose a legacy fight you're never going to be remembered as the greatest
@dextercruzat the moment somebody says "I'm not a Pacquiao fan". They're definitely a Pacquiao fan!
@fmuamba if you lose, man up and accept it. These bitchy tweets are embarrassing
@fmuamba Pacquiao fans have no class whatsoever. That's what I've learned from last night
@BaRaShippers people will just remember Floyd beating everyone. Easily
@BaRaShippers the people's champ....like Ricky Hatton or Oscar De la Hoya. Two loveable losers
@aahyee If Manny was as good as Mayweather he'd have caught hin
@jnchaintreuil if Manny had any footwork he'd have caught him.
@jnchaintreuil awww did your guy lose? Hahaha
@ODDITYMag @MannyPacquiao really? Most people are talking about how bad he is
@sabinarcruz mayweather wasnt in blue corner. He just had a blue advert behind his corner.....!
@LevyMakwala @ewnupdates if you only land 80 punches you're not going to beat anybody
@theyellowcap @ewnupdates @barrybateman comedic seeing as a lot of Mannys famous wins have been down to terrible judging decisions!
@ewnupdates Floyd should. Easy money!
@SportsCenter Manny needs to be a man. And stop with these phony "injury" excuses
@SportsCenter Roach and Arum are weasels. There's no way they would pay Floyd any respect
@SportsCenter anyone who knows boxing, knew that this guy was going to come out with a phony injury claim the minute he lost
@PhillyT2LA @AJones2k1998 @BarrettBoyGeech @PhillyTheKid215 @FloydMayweather only stupid people thought Manny would compete with Floyd..
@PhillyT2LA @AJones2k1998 @BarrettBoyGeech @PhillyTheKid215 @FloydMayweather man up Thomas. You're deluded
@SportsCenter hahaha hilarious. Like David Haye and his injured foot!
@JOE_co_uk Manny should man up. Like David Haye and his toe!
@AndyLangvad @cully10cf @JOE_co_uk @FootbalIFunnyz most people were saying Manny should retire last night. Fake injury claims fight that
@AndyLangvad @cully10cf @JOE_co_uk @FootbalIFunnyz why promoters come out with fake injury excuses after a loss. So you keep the faith
@AndyLangvad @cully10cf @JOE_co_uk @FootbalIFunnyz .....you can't throw punches when theyre not there. Manny admitted that last night
@AndyLangvad @JOE_co_uk @FootbalIFunnyz come on. Everyone looks bad against Floyd. Damaging his legacy with lame excuses
@JOE_co_uk Pacquiao brings out lame, fake, injury story as he can't handle losing
@Alistairovereem hahaha think they've been hit a few too many times
@ONEFCMMA @MannyPacquiao the greatest what? Love the picture you're using.....he lost that fight as well!
@inquirerdotnet errr Pacquiao uses none existant. fake injury as massive excuse!
@bigbets4u awww did your hero lose!
@williamfleitch @GQMagazine if Manny won a boring fight you'd be calling it the greatest ever
@dilly117 @DespaStayFresh Manny only landed 87 punches. A 5 year old kid can count that high
@AlBlades_Jr Asian fans are delusional. And writing articles 2 billion asian fans like, gets you a ton of web hit
@AlBlades_Jr no sane person thinks Manny even won 5 rounds
@KellyBelleScott Mayweather threw more, and landed more punches, numb nuts
@1DOTRAPH he wasn't you fool. That's just the sponsors
@FunSkipBayless when Manny struggles with Marquez, why was anyone expecting him to get near Floyd
@FakeUrban If you weren't expecting a fake injury claim by the user, you don't know boxing!
@textposts that's a sponsors logo. Not the blue corner. Your conspiracy theory has fallen at the first hurdle
@sanchez_isac @ESPNBoxing @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao well it must be if you're a Pacquiao fan. He lost.
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport attacking Floyd guarantees websites tons of Asian web traffic. It's clickbaiting
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport Floyds the biggest PPV seller ever. Much bigger than Pacquiao. No fans?
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport give me a break. The media troll Mayweather as Pacquiao has 2 billion Asian fans they're all chasing
@SBNLukeThomas @LudoviceRy That Arum/Roach injury claim is pathetic by the way. No class. Either of them. If you lose, take it like a man
@SBNLukeThomas @LudoviceRy great fighters have great footwork
@SBNLukeThomas was anyone not expecting Arum/Roache not to come out with a fake "injury" as soon as he lost...
@AmericanVet3 @KevinI @YahooSports MMA fighters make 500 bucks a fight pal. And they get free buffet dinner afterwards
@GuidoFawkes @arryTuttle she declined interviews publically  on twitter. Then declined them again to clarify.But tories still hunt her down?
@GuidoFawkes @arryTuttle  the government supporting media harrassing chlidren for supporting the opposition? That maybe common in Russia!
@GuidoFawkes @arryTuttle you mean the journalist working for a media oligarch? Whose been asked to try and get dirt on a 17 year old?
@GuidoFawkes @ToryHater2015 is Cuddlestone an unusual name?
@GuidoFawkes @ToryHater2015 yes, because using electoral rolls to hunt for children's addresses is not very odd....
@GuidoFawkes @ToryHater2015 Guido standing up for the establishment media, against a plucky little activist. Things have changed
@LouiseMensch @DPMcBride my point is, time would probably be better spent campaigning to win an election
@LouiseMensch @DPMcBride don't get me wrong, Tories have done a great job, spending all day promoting tomorrows Daily Mail/Sun
@LouiseMensch @DPMcBride theme of election is Tories obsessing over Daily Mail vanity projects. And not focussing on what voters care bout
@iandem618 @LouiseMensch Louise has finally found a "floating voter" that is interested in ed stone.The ultra conservative "anti socislista'
@LouiseMensch @IanTrem well no. She's not old enough to go into a pub. You don't harrass children
@LouiseMensch @IanTrem you basically said that a female child getting involved in politics should expect harrssment
@holysmoke @iainmartin1 @LouiseMensch @jameschappers @montie @MrHarryCole wasting time on Tory media vanity projects nobody cares about?
@holysmoke @iainmartin1 @LouiseMensch @jameschappers @montie @MrHarryCole it's slightly scary that you guys think its a big deal?
@holysmoke @iainmartin1 @LouiseMensch @jameschappers @montie @MrHarryCole and most of the replies to the tweets are slagging tories off!
@holysmoke @iainmartin1 @LouiseMensch @jameschappers @montie @MrHarryCole virtually all the tweets on this are from Tory pundits
@holysmoke @iainmartin1 @LouiseMensch @jameschappers @montie @MrHarryCole it's not the BEEBs job to promote fake, Tory, astroturf attempts
@LouiseMensch @BBC virtually all the replies to these astroturf #edstone tweets are slagging the Tories off!
@LouiseMensch @Nick_O_Larse you'll see about 189 tweets from Tory pundits. With most of the replies slagging the Tories off #astroturf
@LouiseMensch @BBC Louise. If you want it on the news, try and get some people who don't work for the Tory machine, to get interested in it
@LouiseMensch @BBC It's not a facist nation. The BEEB aren't here to promote fake, partisan astroturfing "trends" that aren't even trending!
@LouiseMensch @BBC only people I've seen tweeting about it are Tory pundits, Tory MPs and a few of their followers
@LouiseMensch @BBC by "all papers" you mean Tory newspapers. And a small section in the Guardian
@LouiseMensch @BBC Louise, you can't expect the BEEB to get involved in a fake, Tory, astroturfing attempt.
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 then tracks down her 70 year old grandmother?
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 journalist uses internet to track down child. The child declines interview request. So they doorstep her?
@Munchbunchsdad @cjocarroll @OwenJones84 @twcuddleston you think its OK for The Sun to harrass children for engaging in politics?
@Munchbunchsdad @OwenJones84 @twcuddleston she's had The Sun and Guido Fawkes harrassing her mate
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 not a great message. If you're a chikd and dare to disagree with The Sun they will track you down and harrass you
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 I know Rupert has told you to ramp up the hate campaign but she's not even old enough to go to a pub
@geake @unisontweets @fbreckels it's illegal to know postal vote tallies mate. Nobody knows
@geake don't look at polls mate. Tories 13% behind Labour with undecideds!
@geake @GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 so anyone who has an opinion that is different to yours is "brainwashed". Dumb facist
@DrJASmith @OwenJones84 @GuidoFawkes Guido. Big difference between the age of consent and actually legally being an adult.
@DrJASmith @OwenJones84 @GuidoFawkes Media Guido are sort of implying "she's legal" right? How sick
@DrJASmith @OwenJones84 @GuidoFawkes that's such a creepy tweet Guido team! She is actually a child.
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 any libertarian should be backing this kid. Not harrassing him on behalf of his establishment paymasters
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 Guido standing up for establishment, against a plucky little radical, shows you how much he has been bought off
@GuidoFawkes @OwenJones84 this tweet was brought to you by The Sun.
@ShippersUnbound @GuidoFawkes isnt this the story of the Tory campaign. Getting excited about things nobody actually cares about
@ShippersUnbound @GuidoFawkes I'm still trying to find somebody tweeting about this who isn't CCHQ or a Tory pundit
@MediaGuido @GuidoFawkes if you can find some people to tweet about it, who aren't Tory pundits, well the BEEB might cover it!
@MediaGuido @GuidoFawkes Guys, the BEEB are under no obligation to help you with your fake astroturfing attempts
@DPMcBride @GuidoFawkes most of this election is pundits getting excited about things normal voters dont even know happened. #Nerds
@DPMcBride @GuidoFawkes guys its Sunday. The only people talking about Edstone are Westminster political pundits.
@GuidoFawkes reminds me of #cameronettes. Where every tweet from the general public is actually slagging the Tories off!
@GuidoFawkes its not even trending. Only people I've seen tweetng about it furiously are you, Tim Montgomerie and a few Telegraph pundits!
@GuidoFawkes if you want it on the beeb, find some people who don't work for CCHQ or a Tory newspaper, to tweet about it
@GuidoFawkes Guido. The BEEB are under no obligations to publish your fake, astroturfing attempts
@GuidoFawkes @vinwad reminds me of #Cameronettes. Most of the comments on the tweets slagging Tories off!
@GuidoFawkes @vinwad Of all Guido/Tories fake astroturf, trending attempts, this is the lamest. It's Sunday! Have a rest!
@BorisJohnson @carrieapples Carrie is yet to find anyone tweeting on this who doesn't essentially. work for the party.
@JohnJCrace @BorisJohnson I know he goes abroad. But that will be from Heathrow. So he doesn't need to set foot on none-london British soil
@JohnJCrace @BorisJohnson has Boris ever left greater London? I imagine he was born around there
@carrieapples seriously though.Tory political nerds who spend Sundays on the internet are furious. And obvious floating voters. Its a Winner
@carrieapples the only other person you could find was another member of the Westminster punditry brigade....awwwww!
@carrieapples Carrie, I'm not sure Tory pundits tweeting this all day is going to form a trend
@carrieapples have you found someone who isn't a Tory pundit to tweet these yet? Awwww
@carrieapples @montie seriously. Everyone of these Tweets I've seen has either been by Guido, a Telegraph journalist, CCHQ or a Tory pundit!
@carrieapples @montie Carrie. You really need to find somebody who isn't a Tory Pundit, to tweet it, to constitute a trend.
@montie Is it the same one who has just pulled out of leaders questions tomorrow? Sending a minister to face Clegg and Milliband!
@montie @StephanShaxper The Tory media are basically suggesting that Cameron doesn't resign when he doesn't win a majority. A political coup
@montie @StephanShaxper Tories and their media hinting at "SNP illegitimacy" almost amounts to a proposed political coup. Scary times.
@montie @StephanShaxper Not on the ballot papers mate......that's all that matters
@montie @CCHQPress The Daily Mail getting excited about something  doesn't "equal 6 billion votes". It equals about 800......
@montie @CCHQPress isn't the entire problem with the Tory campaign the party wasting time on things nobody really cares that much?
@montie @CCHQPress funny thing is, like the SNP, CCHQ probably think this is a defining issue. When nobody really cares
@RuthDavidsonMSP @JohannLamont Telegraph and Mail pundits just get one vote each. Like me
@RuthDavidsonMSP @JohannLamont Tories constant problem. Thinking the thoughts of the Daily Mail "equals 6 billion votes".When it's about 800
@RuthDavidsonMSP @JohannLamont The private Tory media repeatedly saying it's stupid doesn't actually mean it's stupid you know
@timothy_stanley I bet 99% of #edstone tweets (all 180 of them!) will be traced back to The Telegraph
@timothy_stanley you have to have more people than Tory pundits tweeting on it to be considered viral, you know.
@carolewalkercw Labour doesn't need a deal. They'll just put forward a Queens speech the Lib Dems and SNP can vote for. Ie. Democracy
@carolewalkercw if he refused to resign,with no majority, and used media to push the "legitimacy" line it would  be a political coup attempt
@carolewalkercw if Cameron can't form a majority he has to resign. Game over. For the safety of the nation and the constitutional system
@carolewalkercw Media misleading voters about parliamentary rules is frankly outrageous. Is veering towards supporting populist coup
@carolewalkercw dangerous for media to take this "legitimacy" thing seriously. Basically amounts to a political coup attempt.....
@carolewalkercw well the Tories would rely on DUP vote? People who are anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti gay marriage, ant-contraception?
@BobBrownhouse @carolewalkercw well the core vote is only 33%. That's always been the problem
@carolewalkercw be clear, Milliband needs no deal with SNP. He just needs to put out a Queens speech that has majority support
@carolewalkercw again, media pushing this political coup line of "SNP not being legitimate" is incredibly irresponsible
@carolewalkercw If Cameron refused to resign with no majority, would the most outrageous and dangerous time of 600 years of parliament
@carolewalkercw dangerous for the media to mislead voters on parliamentary rules. It almost amouts to a populist coup attempt by the Tories
@carolewalkercw if Cameron can't form a majority he has to resign. Votes and "biggest party" mean nothing without a majority
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport if Manny was battered by Marquez, why on earth would anyone expect him to trouble Floyd too much?
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport Manny is "past his best" every time he fights a smart counter puncher. Only ever good against brawlers
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport no offense, but this is just a few lame excuses for Pacquiao and a character assassination of Mayweather
@oliverbrown_tel @TelegraphSport worst bit in boxing is pundits sucking up to Pacquiao fans so they don't alienate Asian audiences
@MarioAvossa @BryanAGraham Only because Manny was overhyped. If he struggles with Marquez, how was he going to challenge Floyd?
@OscarDeLaHoya be thankful you pushed Floyd a heck of a lot closer than Manny did. Which shows Manny fought you when you were shot/finished
@OscarDeLaHoya If you were getting a cut tonight you'd be calling it the greatest fight ever
@OscarDeLaHoya you like to see your friend Manny win. You mean
@mindoftd @OscarDeLaHoya Khan is fast. But no chin. And no brain. Panics when he gets tagged
@mindoftd @OscarDeLaHoya Floyd would knock Khan out. He can't take the shots like Manny
@BauxSingh @OscarDeLaHoya @KamManir the De la Hoya/Mayweather blueprint. Be 165 pounds when you enter the ring?
@OscarDeLaHoya you should show some class. Not cry and moan as your friend Manny lost.
@OscarDeLaHoya just no class. Pacquiaos friends and fans are always trying to come up with endless excuses
@OscarDeLaHoya I think the truth is you cry like a bitch when your friend Manny Pacquiao loses
@OscarDeLaHoya You may be friends with Manny, and hate Floyds guts, but you can still show integrity, respect and professionalism.
@OscarDeLaHoya even though Manny is your friend, you should still be able to respect great/genius boxing
@OscarDeLaHoya such a girly, bitchy tweet Oscar. I expected more.
@OscarDeLaHoya man up Oscar. Stop crying as your friend lost.
@Thunderthumbs @OscarDeLaHoya what? That Oscars one of Mannys friends and is crying like a bitch
@IWC_Official @SamsonTellme @OscarDeLaHoya @FloydMayweather Marciano didn't beat anyone. Like a typical Pacfan you have no clue about boxing
@IWC_Official @danbrok88 @OscarDeLaHoya @FloydMayweather awwww did your guy Manny lose!!! Stop crying. Man up
@Ginge @OscarDeLaHoya 150 million to Floyd. How much do MMA guys make? 500 bucks and a free dinner?
@OscarDeLaHoya awwwww! Oscar is crying as his friend Manny Pacquiao lost! How cute!
@jakeduceyauthor @OscarDeLaHoya @Canelo @KOKirkland @HBOboxing Pacquiao fans were never into boxing in the first place
@OscarDeLaHoya @Canelo @KOKirkland @HBOboxing awww Oscar is sulking as his friend Manny lost!
@GarethADaviesDT @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao probably won by 6 rounds. Not sure Manny even had a good round all night
@GarethADaviesDT @FloydMayweather @MannyPacquiao Always thought if pundits are giving it to Mayweather by 4 he must have won by a mile
@LiberalHeroine is that why you have the pouty, instagrammed, profile picture
@EmiliePWilliams should be #FeministsAreArrogant
@ShesSuperNova should be #FeministAreArrogant
@monetgrrl should be "feminists are arrogant"
@MichelleDBeadle I suspect Mayweatyer banned you as some reporters devote lives to promoting his mistakes, while covering up Mannys.....
@MichelleDBeadle sorry, but if you ignore all of Pacquiaos terrible activity, as he's commercially lucrative, you have no credibility
@MichelleDBeadle Pacquiao regularly calls gay people disgusting scum. And says he wants them to burn in hell. ESPN always cover it up.
@MichelleDBeadle how many times has Michelle ever asked Pacquiao about his rampant homophobia and his disgusting abuse of gay people?
@Rachel__Nichols criticizing Pacquiao and holding him to account costs money. There are 2 billion people in Asia.
@Rachel__Nichols Pacquiao regularly calls gay people disgusting scum. And says he wants them to burn in hell. Much coverage on CNN?
@Rachel__Nichols ask yourself. How many times has Rachel asked Pacquiao about his rampant homophobia and abuse of gay people. Integrity?
@PaulVPistol @Rachel__Nichols how many times has Rachel asked Pacquiao about his rampant homophobia and abuse of gay people?
@Rachel__Nichols going after Mayweather is lucrative in the USA. Going after Asias favourite son isn't.
@Rachel__Nichols Manny called gay people disgusting scum. And said they should all burn in hell. Have CNN ever challenged him on that?
@Rachel__Nichols Rachel. Fact you've never once challenged Pacquiao on his rampant homophobia and disgusting comments says everything
@Pemcdonald11 @Divine137 holding Mayweather accountable is lucrative. Asias favourite athlete? Nope.
@Pemcdonald11 @Divine137 has CNN or ESPN ever challenged Pacquiao on his homophobia? Nope. Tells you everything about agenda
@Pemcdonald11 @Divine137 Pacquiao is a famous homophobe. Calls gay people disgusting scum. Says they should burn in hell...
@Rachel__Nichols fact that CNN and ESPN have never challenged Manny on his homophobia makes tells you everything
@Rachel__Nichols how many times has Rachel ever asked Manny about his rampant homophobia?  Zero.
@Rachel__Nichols @MichelleDBeadle fact that you and Michelle completely cover up Mannys homophobia for commercial reasons, says it all
@Rachel__Nichols @MichelleDBeadle yeah, you regularly report on Manny Pacquiao being a massive disgusting homophobe don't you?
@hannahsnow @MSmithsonPB suspect Sunday Times are paying him for a "best case scenario" projection
@hannahsnow @MSmithsonPB his projection never changes. No matter what polls say!
@BobFox04539154 @jpm287 @MSmithsonPB Polls were miles off 3rd party in 2010 but still got Tory/Lab right. For example
@BobFox04539154 @jpm287 @MSmithsonPB won't be 92 ever again. Used small samples then. The problem
@BobFox04539154 @MSmithsonPB UKIP have been on 10-11% in other polls and Tories have had nothing more than small lead
@BobFox04539154 @MSmithsonPB errrr na!
@charleshymas @MSmithsonPB those are Peter Kellners personal projections. Not Yougovs. He's completely ignoring Yougov. His own company!
@MSmithsonPB @simonk133 @tmlbk @ShippersUnbound @LordAshcroft Kellners numbers completely ignore his own company, Yougovs, polls!
@MSmithsonPB @simonk133 @tmlbk @ShippersUnbound @LordAshcroft Kellners numbers are Murdoch pleasing gibberish. No offense!
@ShippersUnbound @SR_Ingham @OwenJones84 squatting in number 10 is just plain irresponsible. Puts entire country at risk.
@ShippersUnbound @SR_Ingham @OwenJones84 imagine if Brown had tried to govern on in 2010! Daring Lib Dems to vote him down!
@ShippersUnbound @SR_Ingham @OwenJones84 its not Tories decision. Its 600 years of parliamentary procedure
@PeterMannionMP @neiledwardlovat @ShippersUnbound you don't peter. You dont
@PeterMannionMP @neiledwardlovat @ShippersUnbound imagine if Brown refused to resign in 2010! And made MPs vote him down!
@PeterMannionMP @neiledwardlovat @ShippersUnbound Tories thinking about populist coup of British constitution
@PeterMannionMP @neiledwardlovat @ShippersUnbound you have it completely wrong. Labour quoting 600 years of parliamentary procedure
@PeterMannionMP @ShippersUnbound putting nation in limbo for 3 weeks for your own pride is outrageous. And dangerous
@ShippersUnbound of course he does. Squatting in parliament with no majority is absolutely outrageous. Puts country at risk
@ShippersUnbound @Nozzell72 @OwenJones84 traction for what? A populist coup of parliament?
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 voters who don't understand parliamentary system and are being misled by media. Coup territory
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 PM has to resign when he has no majority. As it puts the nation ahead of himself
@ShippersUnbound @hoddles10 you mean some Tories have no honour whatsoever.
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @SR_Ingham hanging on when you have no majority puts country at risk. And constitution at risk.
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @SR_Ingham but he resigned when he couldn't form majority. He didn't try and get a Queens speech through
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 a minority of voters hated the Tory/Libs teaming up. They rioted over it. Still legitimate
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 what your saying is the minority, who didn't vote for them, won't like it. Well that's democracy
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 considering majority of voters would have voted for Labour or SNP no risk.
@DPJHodges @Debsalini @ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 people vote Labour or SNP as they want them in government.
@DPJHodges @Debsalini @ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 better for you Dan. You'd retain your dignity. Not for majority who voted Lab or SNP
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 no risk at all. Other than the Tory media not liking it.
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @geoffingarfield the rules exist to stop populist coups by losing parties and their media
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @geoffingarfield public opinion doesn't matter. 600 years of democracy/procedure is all that counts
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @geoffingarfield Tories agree . That's a large number of people. But having winners and losers is democracy
@OwenJones84 @ShippersUnbound @SR_Ingham Tories misleading voters on parliamentary procedure, and staying on, would amount to a coup
@SR_Ingham @ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 its clear he has no confidenc when he has no majority. Dishonorable not to resign then
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @SR_Ingham Tory party attempting to mislead them would amount to a coup
@ShippersUnbound @OwenJones84 @SR_Ingham how many voters understand our parliamentary system?
@ShippersUnbound not only is it completely dishonorable, but by putting parliament in limbo he is endangering country and voters.
@ShippersUnbound doesn't matter Tim. You and I both know a PM should resign the minute he can't form majority.
@ShippersUnbound if Cameron and The Times hadn't campaigned heavily for FPTP only 3 years ago this would be less tragic
@ShippersUnbound and if Newspaper pundits have any honour they will demand his resignation the minute he can't form a majority
@ShippersUnbound if a PM has any honour whatsoever he resigns the minute he can't form a majority. Even Gordon Brown did it!
@ShippersUnbound what you mean is Tories will show absolutely no character or honour and squat in number 10 for a few weeks
@ShippersUnbound errrr he canpaigned for FPTP in 2011? This is the system voters want
@Ronniegeorge @MSmithsonPB @ShippersUnbound @TSEofPB Mail talking about most votes. They don't want AV though!
@Ronniegeorge @MSmithsonPB @ShippersUnbound @TSEofPB Tories would do worse out of AV anyway. Lose lots of seats to UKIP and Libs
@Ronniegeorge @RecentlyRealRxx @MSmithsonPB @ShippersUnbound @TSEofPB but two parties campaigned against AV. And won
@Ronniegeorge @MSmithsonPB @ShippersUnbound @TSEofPB errr Tories campaigned against AV in 2011? This is system they want
@MSmithsonPB @ShippersUnbound @TSEofPB god. The Daily Mail have retreated to vote counts now!
@spoole5 @RichdelaRiv @MSmithsonPB don't get your point. Online is more accurate. Bigger samples
@TimHier @frank_fisher @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan bare minimum, Tories will lose 30 seats from 2010. Could be 50+
@TimHier @frank_fisher @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan you see Tories gaining 5-6 seats. When they're polling to lose 40ish?
@TimHier @SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan think younger UKIP voters are going to tell people they're voting UKIP?
@TimHier @SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan if I was a Tory I'd be more worried about shy UKIPers!
@TimHier @SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan polls much more cautious than in 1992. Theyre taking into account these things.
@TimHier @SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan people embarrassed to like Tories? Or Ed?  Could be either
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan I don't recall any big late swing to government other than 1992. Small swings, yes.
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan 3% Tory lead means they're level on seats with Lab. 5% may not be enough to form coalition
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan even if Tories do get 5% boost (seriously doubt it) might not be enough to stay in power
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan polls barely changed at all in last few days before 2010.
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan what evidence is that nonsense based on?
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan Dan said Tories would storm ahead by end of  2014 in fact!
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan pretends he always thought swing would be late.He's been claiming it's imminent for months!
@TimHier @DPJHodges @SpinningHugo @johnmcternan Dan has been saying "from now" since February.
@SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan making crazy pro-Tory claims that never happen, is his reputation!
@SpinningHugo @DPJHodges @johnmcternan what reputation?
@SpinningHugo @johnmcternan @DPJHodges him projecting the exact majority figure? For a Murdoch paper? Hmmmmmm!
@SpinningHugo @johnmcternan @DPJHodges so Tory Petes projection, for a Tory paper, magically has them hitting the exact majority figure!
@justin_mcguirk @DPJHodges sorry to break it to you, but like Dan, Tory Pete has been saying that for 8 weeks
@DPJHodges this has been his projection from the start. He hasn't reacted to the polls at all. Which should tell you its not based on data.
@DPJHodges do you trust Peter Kellnerz opinion, in a Murdoch column, or the polling experts he employs as they're better than him...
@DPJHodges Dan. Yougov (peters polling company) has it much closer on their seat projection! Only a few seats in it
@DPJHodges Peter Kellner, the Tory, who is employed by Rupert Murdoch.....you mean
@Samfr @RobertCorkEsq @DPJHodges @LabourUncut I seriously think they just wrote an Ed attack article without making it realistic!
@Samfr @RobertCorkEsq @DPJHodges @LabourUncut they only added that bit later to article . After people told them!
@StephenPLundy @Samfr @DPJHodges @LabourUncut which is why you can guarantee the entire story is basically made up
@StephenPLundy @Samfr @DPJHodges @LabourUncut yes its illegal. They'd be imprisoned in fact
@Samfr unless Uncut are willing to go to prison for posting useless information I doubt this is real
@Samfr law was changed to make it impossible for parties to tally postal votes. Law also changed to make reporting them illegal!
@Samfr it's from Uncut mate. It's 99% likely to be completely made up!
@sibarnes2000 @Samfr @DPJHodges @LabourUncut it's a bogus article
@Samfr @LabourUncut @DPJHodges not only impossible to tally postal counts now but also illegal to report them. Made up stort
@Samfr @LabourUncut @DPJHodges coalition not only changed law to make it impossible to tally postalcount but made it illegal to report them
@Samfr @LabourUncut @DPJHodges you had to know Dan would be all over this made up Blairite attack article
@DPJHodges if all you care about is staying in power, like Dave, it's easy to stay passionless
@DPJHodges Eds been passionate from the start. That's the Tories problem
@DPJHodges haha deary me. Dan is trying to claim tired, bored, passionless Cameron is just being "statesman like"
@MichaelESC @APootler @NCPoliticsUK he works for Murdoch
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges Yougov (his company) has Tories only a few seats ahead in their projection. How ludicrous Peter is
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges Kellners job at The Times is to motivate stay-at-home Tories to vote
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges when a guy just stubbornly sticks to his original projection no matter how polls change, its stupid
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges I swear his seat projection hasn't changed at all in the last 4 weeks. What do they pay him for!
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges Kellner is an employee of Rupert Murdoh. He tells them whatever they want to hear
@NCPoliticsUK @charleshymas @DPJHodges yeah....polls have been moving towards Labour for last 48 hours!
@roadto326 @charleshymas @DPJHodges I dont respect him as he doesn't change his projection with the information.Just stubbornly sticks to it
@roadto326 @charleshymas @DPJHodges He's had this seat projection since day 1. Hasn't reacted to the polls at all!
@roadto326 @charleshymas @DPJHodges Kellner just tells his Tory media employees what they want to hear....
@HywelRoberts2 @DPJHodges no. He won't even be allowed in parliament! If he loses he's history.
@DPJHodges DUP are strongly anti abortion, anti birth control, anti gay rights etc. Could Clegg sell that to the Lib Dems?
@DPJHodges Would DUP agree to work with Libs. And vice versa? DUP are far right!
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli they're the variables that will decide a very tight seats race.
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli Tories might take 15 from Libs. They might end up with 10. Labour might hold on to some Scot seats
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli so Labour would then have to simply take more seats from other parties than Tories do.
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli Labour then lose 40 to SNP. Which makes them level with Tories again on seats.
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli Labour 40ish behind from 2010. But if Lab take 40ish seats from Tories they would be 40 ahead
@DPJHodges @DavidLazar45 @AlbertoNardelli every time Labour gain a seat (from Tories) the Tories lose a seat. So it's a net +2 seats for Lab
@DPJHodges @AlbertoNardelli basic mathematics Dan. Every seat Labour gain from Tories,  counts as two. So 40 wins is really 80.
@DPJHodges @AlbertoNardelli Labour set to gain 40 from Tories....and they count double. Duh.
@SamCoatesTimes @anthonyjwells @atulh there's nothing illegal about websites releasing gibberish....
@SamCoatesTimes @anthonyjwells @atulh suspect more likely scenario is Uncut are mischief making. And forgot rules got changed!
@SamCoatesTimes @anthonyjwells @atulh Considering commission changed law to stop this happening I doubt that.
@missmeow16 @atulh there's nothing illegal about making up vote tallies!
@atulh @lukeakehurst @robfordmancs @davidbutler100 you'll mischief make some more I suspect
@craigawoodhouse @robfordmancs @atulh @davidbutler100 Atuls article is based on fantasy world of 2010 election law....
@craigawoodhouse @robfordmancs @atulh @davidbutler100 it's gibberish. Law was changed so parties can't tally them any more.
@atulh @BBCPropaganda @StephenPLundy @davidbutler100 they changed the law to maintain secrecy from parties. Article is gibberish mate.
@SamCoatesTimes @anthonyjwells @atulh illegal to report actual tallies. Not illegal to report gibberish. Newspapers should know that
@anthonyjwells @SamCoatesTimes @atulh illlegal to report actual vote tallies. Nothing illegal about making them up.
@anthonyjwells @SamCoatesTimes @atulh you're assuming the Ed-hating Labour Uncut aren't just mischief making.....
@atulh @SamCoatesTimes Sam is right. Law was changed recently so this vote tallying practice can no longer happen
@atulh @SamCoatesTimes you made the story up basically. Lets be honest!
@LabourUncut @atulh or if you insist on made-up stories, at least write them so they make sense!
@LabourUncut @atulh I wish all you Dan Hodges type, Ed haters would stop all this phony mischief making.
@LabourUncut @atulh even if you ignore the fact it's impossible for Labour to actually know the counts, it doesn't even make sense?
@LabourUncut @atulh Electoral Commission changed rules this year so parties can no longer have any idea of postal counts.....
@LabourUncut @atulh what a load of rubbish. Electoral Commission changed rules recently to make this impossible
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB @LabourUncut ElectoralCommission changed rules recently. Making it impossible for parties to have any idea of counts
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB @LabourUncut if you know about how postal voting works now, it can't possibly be true. Just made up mischief making
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB @LabourUncut Labour Uncut is run by Ed-hating, Dan Hodges types, who want him to lose. Basically
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB @LabourUncut well it will probably be made up! Trying to create some mischief.
@chrishanretty @MeanwhileScotia @MSmithsonPB don't agree. Exit polling is fabulous these days.  Will be bang on
@MSmithsonPB @NCPoliticsUK I'd take anything they say with a huge pinch of salt. It's basically just a Milliband/Brand attack article
@MSmithsonPB @NCPoliticsUK Labour Uncut is run by angry Blair-ites like Dan Hodges who generally dislike Ed Milliband quite a lot!
@MSmithsonPB polls are starting to align around 34/33/8/14.
@cammybaillie @MSmithsonPB as Mike says markets are never as close as the polls.
@cammybaillie @MSmithsonPB can you keep your crazy Tory campaigning to political articles and sites. This one is about maths and logic
@RobCorb1127 @TamPayne2 well the SNP are winners. That's another difference
@TamPayne2 @cammybaillie unfortunately for you only Tories really care that much...
@TheRedRag @cammybaillie people tend to get paranoid when they think they're going to lose
@cammybaillie @RFHunt1 seeing as you seemingly tweet 17 hours a day, I seriously doubt you work!
@DanHannanMEP @cammybaillie Ed will simply put forward Queens Speech and left wing bills and the SNP will vote for everyone
@DanHannanMEP @cammybaillie Dan. Thanks to your dopey "Fixed Term Parliament Act" he doesn't need to do deals with anyone. Thanks Tories!
@DanHannanMEP @cammybaillie unfortunately for you Dan 35% do.
@cammybaillie @georgegalloway you really are quite obsessed with white power aren't you.
@cammybaillie @hale_razor @BNLieb I doubt you'd even be commenting if black people weren't involved.
@cammybaillie @hale_razor @BNLieb white supremacists tend to think equality is 'racism against us white folks!!!!!"
@cammybaillie @itvnews is that the British Nazi Parties official line?
@cammybaillie @chrissy_cfc aren't Tories going to go into coalition with Irish unioists? The Orange Orders political wing? They march!
@David_Cameron @MaryRobinson01 @cammybaillie well you have to win the 300 odd you have already. Then another 23 on top of that!
@RayJBray @Haitch7 @lamontsbrother @KayBurley come on. Australia has a referendum every 15 years. So will Scots
@TheCommentator @UKIP @cammybaillie Libs will drop referendum as condition of coalition. And if they don't the DUP will!
@HollysBuddy @TheCommentator @bernerlap @UKIP won't tories just drop referendum as condition of coalition with Libs and DUP?
@HollysBuddy @TheCommentator @bernerlap @UKIP isnt it more likely if UKIP win seats?
@TheCommentator @UKIP @cammybaillie begging for tactical votes is a surefire sign that they think they're going to lose!
@TheCommentator @UKIP @cammybaillie I suspect 40% don't care. That's the Tories problem
@timothy_stanley @cammybaillie pity Tory pundits only have 1 vote each Tim!
@cammybaillie don't you just vote for the party that protects your narrow interests best, as well?
@cammybaillie polling has moved on a lot in last 20 odd years!
@dkhall44 @Steptoesyard @afneil @LordAshcroft think the defining factor will be how much Tories misjudged the SNP factor.....
@EastUpper3 @afneil @LordAshcroft @CampaignWatchUK Tories won't have most seats with this poll. They need at least 2-3% lead to win more.
@BBCPropaganda @LordAshcroft @afneil @CampaignWatchUK maybe if you're a massive royalist. But theyre already staunch Tories
@BBCPropaganda @LordAshcroft @afneil @CampaignWatchUK to cut a long story short, a royal baby doesn't make people feel that good!
@BBCPropaganda @LordAshcroft @afneil @CampaignWatchUK royal babies never effect pollling. Silver Jubilee only had very small effect
@fizzy_mike @ZodiacNein @afneil @LordAshcroft @CampaignWatchUK manipulating intetest rates and cash is a phony recovery. Nobody feels it
@fizzy_mike @ZodiacNein @afneil @LordAshcroft @CampaignWatchUK with own central bank US and UK can manipulate interest rates, and print cash
@fizzy_mike @ZodiacNein @afneil @LordAshcroft @CampaignWatchUK only because UK and US have their own central banks.......
@LordAshcroft @afneil @CampaignWatchUK if polls haven't really moved in last 4 months, why would they in 2 more weeks?
@fizzy_mike @MSmithsonPB @DPJHodges @GeorgeFoulkes that's paranoia Mike. In stressful times people read into things too much.
@fizzy_mike @MSmithsonPB @DPJHodges @GeorgeFoulkes you mean maths is underestimating thr Tory vote significantly? They're quoting maths.
@fizzy_mike @DPJHodges @GeorgeFoulkes @MSmithsonPB no. Mike has stood for parliament as a Lib Dem.
@JivrajNoor @MSmithsonPB not saying that means they're right! But it makes their polling very consistent
@JivrajNoor @MSmithsonPB Yougov interview over 1000 people a day. 7000 a week. Probably 3x as many people as some polls. 7x as many as some
@JivrajNoor @MSmithsonPB some weekly polls only have a sample of 1000 for the entire week. So interviewing about 150 people a day
@JivrajNoor @MSmithsonPB Yougov take bigger samples. So their polls are more consistent. Less prone to big changes/outliers
@deakin_lewis @MSmithsonPB "poll of polls" is a 1% Tory lead. That's the average figure of all polls, currently.
@MSmithsonPB average/median in polling is "poll of polls" so if you're poll is far away from that, in theory, you should be wrong. And lose
@MSmithsonPB game theory, wisdom of crowds etc etc suggest the further away you are from average/median the more likely you are to be wrong
@MSmithsonPB this is very close to "poll of polls"numbers, so in theory, should be correct-ish.....!
@SandraBlack9 @MSmithsonPB 3% either way. But they usually try and be within 1%
@dannyalexander @MSmithsonPB people only start talking about tactical voting when they think they're going to lose...
@MSmithsonPB @CllrRJohnson two horse race a lot easier to poll than 3-4-5 way splits
@DPJHodges @rcdavidsonuk @keiranpedley whose seeing it? Polling companies aren't. Survation tonight is same as last week!
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges Yougovs daily sample is over a thousand.......so their weekly sample 8x the size of a weekly phone poll
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges weekly phone polls only use a sample of 900ish. That's 7 daily samples of 150ish?
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges phone and online aren't that far apart now. But phone are more likelier to be wrong.
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges phone and online polls are pretty close now.
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley phone polls don't show Tories getting 300 seats either Dan! Absolute best case scenario is maybe 290 currently.
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley that's bonkers. They're currently polling to lose at least 25 from 2010. Maybe double that.
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley without indy ref, Labour would be looking at 300-330 seats. Easily.
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley come on Dan. Labour became toxic in Scotland only  after teaming up with The Tories indy ref negative campaigning
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges @MSmithsonPB @fizzy_mike @GeorgeFoulkes Dan doesn't believe half the stuff he says. It's just his default position
@keiranpedley @DPJHodges @MSmithsonPB @fizzy_mike @GeorgeFoulkes Dan's stupidity is only surpassed by his stubborness
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB @fizzy_mike @GeorgeFoulkes Labour would be looking at 300-330 seats without the SNP indy ref surge
@DPJHodges @keiranpedley @MSmithsonPB @fizzy_mike @GeorgeFoulkes give me break. You'd be looking at a Labour majority without the indy ref.
@DPJHodges @GeorgeFoulkes @MSmithsonPB Dan has slowly retreated from a big Tory majority to a valiant "most seats" loss.
@MurdochPol people laugh, but this guy could have learning difficulties, mental health issues etc etc.
@MurdochPol why are the police taking something from his home and putting it online? Privacy? Civil Rights?
@AbiolaHP @afroswede @MSmithsonPB and would it make much difference? Most UKIP voters are in Tory safe seats anyway.
@AbiolaHP @afroswede @MSmithsonPB problem with your theory is, if It's such a big thing, why haven't they already switched?
@AbiolaHP @afroswede @MSmithsonPB how have you decided that? The dead level polls of the last 48 hours?
@afroswede @AbiolaHP it's the exact opposite. If Tories don't take more than 290 seats they can't win.
@afroswede @AbiolaHP Labour lose every seat in Scotland, but take 40+ from Tories, and Tories take 15 from Libs? Labour would be in power
@afroswede @AbiolaHP If Tories lose 40 seats to Labour, and gain 15 from Libs they will only have about 10 more seats than Labour.
@afroswede @AbiolaHP odd mathematics. Labour gains from Tories count double. They're currently polling to take 40+ from Tories.
@afroswede @AbiolaHP they only have 41 seats in Scotland. So it would be 41 if they lost them all.
@afroswede @AbiolaHP incumbuncy only works if you're liked/respected in the first place. If not, people want you out.
@afroswede @AbiolaHP Tories winning 300 seats? Polls would currently have to be 6-7% wrong for that to happen.
@AbiolaHP @afroswede my point being Tories need to improve vastly with undecideds to stay in power. Not Labour.
@AbiolaHP @afroswede Tories not doing very well with undecideds last time I looked. Polling only 21%. Labour had 14% lead with that group
@AbiolaHP @afroswede so you guess UKIP will poll 6-7% below what pollsters say. And 5% of that will go to Tories. That's a lot of guessing
@AbiolaHP @afroswede @MSmithsonPB but both of your anecdotal opinions mean a lot.
@AbiolaHP @afroswede @MSmithsonPB that ignores basically all known logic
@Play4Blood @Oahu_Raider808 players get personal team chefs, dieticians, trainers, therapists. Support network is a lot higher than college
@Play4Blood @Oahu_Raider808 His problems were weight issues. Oakland obviously think in a pro environment that will change
@Play4Blood @Oahu_Raider808 what crap! Lots of players have poor college careers, and great pro careers!
@Telegraph any newspaper that suggests voting against your own party, is an affront to democracy
@Telegraph when anyone discusses tactical voting it's because they think they're going to lose.
@Telegraph has it come to this Telegraph? Trying to get your readers to tactically vote. How desperate!
@Brian00081 @Telegraph tricky question. Would you be more embarrassed to tell people you were voting Tory or for Milliband?
@Telegraph telegraph purposefully using poll of polls as there were several one-off outliers that boosted Tories average
@Telegraph they've actually been level, or behind in every poll in the last 48 hours
@TRobinsonNewEra @evianeleidig @rick_n or she could have just grown up, and moved on.
@TRobinsonNewEra when you live among Muslims and realize they're perfectly nice, normal, friendly, charitable British people you don't care
@TRobinsonNewEra that's why the white people there vote Labour as well mate
@TRobinsonNewEra @savarkar5200 @anjemchoudary but they are as British as you right?
@TRobinsonNewEra Tommy. Labour representing people regardless of their race is why 35% of the country vote for them
@savarkar5200 @anjemchoudary @TRobinsonNewEra Or don't you class Muslims as British? #BNP
@savarkar5200 @anjemchoudary @TRobinsonNewEra the people arrested in Rotherham were all British you know.
@india_israel @savarkar5200 @TRobinsonNewEra @anjemchoudary "patriots" basically means "racists" right?
@Nigel_Farage @David_Cameron aren't you both multi-millionaires? Cheap get!
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB @sportingindex he also wins same amount if Labour have more seats.
@justin_mcguirk @MSmithsonPB @sportingindex no. He's betting that maximum seats Tories can win is +23
@CLeslieMP seriously though, I agree, politicians shouldn't be targeted personally. No place in a democracy. Keep it civil folks
@Ruth_R_Davis @CLeslieMP @CLeslieTeam2015 well it's always going to be blue until they stop jerrymandering the constituencies
@sarahjbward @CLeslieMP you're implying it's political? And not just some random idiot who hates the Tories
@angelneptustar @afneil @silverstrivers remember my 1993 school being little more than unheated asbestosfilled portacabins and outside loos
@angelneptustar @afneil @silverstrivers Tories left country in such a shocking state they really had no choice did they?
@angelneptustar @afneil @silverstrivers and I'd say 3 election majorities was a decent mandate!
@angelneptustar @afneil @silverstrivers Labour were spending less than the Tory government that preceeded them mate.
@angelneptustar @afneil @silverstrivers "Fraser Nelson explains" is where you should have stopped reading
@FOP3 surely the real problem is complete lack of accountabilty by police departments. Killing people then trying to beat the case
@FOP3 if you have put an unrestrained, innocent man, in your police van,then joy rided around town to bash him up. You're triply responsible
@FOP3 If you've illegally arrested an innocent man you're doubly responsible.
@FOP3 errr, if you put a guy in a police van with no seat belt you're responsible anyway.
@FOP3 but not in decent society
@FOP3 I suspect arresting a black guy for no reason, then rough riding him around town is considered honorable in police circles.
@MikeTanier you media guys don't like Cam Newton or RG3 or Bridgewater and want them to fail. Luckily for the players the teams disagree
@MikeTanier this American thing of only focussing on positives of white QBs and negatives of black QBs is also annoying
@MikeTanier is there even a QB in the league thar throws as many picks and near picks as Andrew Luck?
@MikeTanier the personal favourite line was saying Winston won't be like Luck because of turnovers. Luck leads the league in turnovers!
@MikeTanier this media thing of trashing top talent like Newton and Bridgewater and hyping  bozos like Manziel needs to end
@MikeTanier Mariota is the guy scouts were saying, pre draft, might never do anything at the NFL level and has huge bust potential
@MikeTanier This new media narrative that Mariota is suddenly the better, safer talent, is just beyond hilarious
@MikeTanier US pundits hyping up 2nd round Quarteback talent (Mariota) as they don't like the black guy's personality......
@Sabbinii @MSmithsonPB you only get an incumbuncy boost if you're generally respected Mike. Not sure Tories are. Even by own MPs!
@TeaJunkie1 @Bernard_Collier @MSmithsonPB they'll change their method to get closer to rival firms. No pollster wants to go down alone!
@MSmithsonPB Labour poll well with undecideds. Tories and Libs quite poorly. Ridiculous methodolgy to use, 2010 results
@MSmithsonPB if that's there method, decent chance they're going to overpoll Tories and Libs. And underpoll UKIP and Labour
@MSmithsonPB dodgy method change, that is
@seatsixtyone @MSmithsonPB fantastic. Although I've driven from Bristol to Newcastle in 3 hours!
@FraserNelson @Telegraph Tory/Lib government has been disasterous for Labour/SNP voters. But they accept it.
@FraserNelson @Telegraph if we have a Labour/SNP government it will be because that's what the majority of UK want. Stop bleating
@FraserNelson @Telegraph title of this article is "Fraser only believes in coalition politics as long as Tories are in it"
@FraserNelson @Telegraph Tories actually do worse out of proportional representation anyway! Would lose huge amount of seats to UKIP/Libs
@Isaac_Spring @FraserNelson @Telegraph tories have about a 40% chance of being in any form of government currently. Things could change
@Isaac_Spring @FraserNelson @Telegraph spread betting is usually miles off. Fraser is using it as it shows Tories in best light
@mrmilibean @FraserNelson @Telegraph if more people want a Tory/Lib Dem government they'll stay in power
@mrmilibean @FraserNelson @Telegraph well it would be the will of more people who voted for Tories/Libs. Ie. Democracy
@FraserNelson @Telegraph if you're in the minority/lose an election, you're not going to like it.But stop trying to circumnavigate democracy
@FraserNelson @Telegraph It won't be a disaster for the majority of British voters who voted for SNP or Labour. It will be brilliant!
@FraserNelson @Telegraph The Tory coalition has been an absolute disaster for SNP and Labour voters. But that's democracy
@FraserNelson @Telegraph people who lose an election aren't going to like the government.
@FraserNelson @markdudek1 The Tory coalition has been an absolute disaster for SNP and Labour voters. But That's democracy Fraser.
@FraserNelson @markdudek1 who would it be disaster for? People who don't vote Labour or SNP? As in, the minority? That's democracy
@Telegraph probably plenty of Telegraph plants in undecided section. Like Mrs. Shuttleworth. Who signed their small business letter
@Telegraph the women who attacked Ed, lied about being an undecided. Revealed today she signed the Telegraph small business letter!
@Telegraph Shuttleworth, the lady who attacked Ed got into audience as an "undecided".But she signed the Telegraph business letter weeks ago
@Telegraph One of the "undecided" voters who attacked Ed was a Telegraph plant? Was revealed today she signed the Telegraph business letter!
@Telegraph @FraserNelson Fraser. The Tory coalition has been a disaster for Labour/SNP voters. That's democracy. Man up. Sore loser
@theamandaball @Telegraph @FraserNelson ie.the losers.......
@theamandaball @Telegraph @FraserNelson i think Fraser means it would be a disaster for the minority of voters who didn't vote for them.
@Telegraph @FraserNelson well not for the majority of people who voted for them.....!
@JGForsyth Tories.  Labour and SNP are both going to vote for all left wing things and against all right wing things...don't need deals.
@JGForsyth what? milliband said no deals? Andy Burnham is saying they would govern vote-by-vote. Stop playing dumb!
@JGForsyth Tories have lost ground in polls in the last 24 hours. Opposite of surge!
@JGForsyth It was like with Mitt Romney. Conservative media seem to think if they repeat positive messages, they're real?
@JGForsyth Tories have actually been losing ground over the last 24 hours. They're basically behind or level in most pokls now
@JGForsyth hahaha. Hasn't this been the Tory media all month? Talking about a Tory surge that has never come
@JGForsyth @ElectionsEtc Tories are level/ or behind in most national polls now and 3% behind Labour in marginals. This is gibberish!
@JGForsyth @ElectionsEtc James ignores the other 5 projections saying Cameron is basically  finished
@PeterArnottGlas @JGForsyth you don't need deals to know SNP and Labour are going to vote for left wing policies and against right wing ones
@PeterArnottGlas @JGForsyth SNP and Labour agree on almost everything. They'll vote the same way whether its in government or opposition
@PeterArnottGlas @JGForsyth you either dont understand too much or are playing dumb. Labour don't need an SNP deal to get their votes
@JGForsyth James, your "playing dumb" act is most tiring......you know the difference between doing a deal, and vote-by-vote politics
@orthoandtrauma @MrHarryCole a very modern, new, cutting edge invention. The microphone
@MrHarryCole why I have no respect for Guido any more. If it was Ed, he'd be going nuts! Because it's a Tory they're running PR support
@fullabeanz @MrHarryCole well, people have criticising Cameron for years for having no passion for politics. Just for power
@MrHarryCole You mean "Harry Cole and Gove try and defend gaffe"
@TheNickShook but explaining that would have ruined your own trolly article, I guess
@TheNickShook You obvioisly know Captain Crab sent him the legs as a light hearted joke/advertising opportunity. And he's playing along
@DPJHodges @nickwealthall @casparberry was that the Brand disaster you warned about. Labour leading most polls now?
@DPJHodges @nickwealthall @casparberry good time to tell Dan that Labour lead in all 3 polls released tonight.
@DPJHodges @nickwealthall @casparberry Labour leading in 3 polls tonight Dan. Dont take it!
@DPJHodges @nickwealthall @casparberry @twcuddleston because you write trolly things designed to click bait people to a failing newspaper
@DPJHodges @casparberry @twcuddleston @nickwealthall Come on Dan. Laughing at a slight stumble. That's downmarket tabloid territory!
@JGForsyth worrying that Tory media are already trying to mislead people on minority government parliament. This isnt democracy
@JGForsyth SNP will never vote with Tories. He doesn't need a deal. Will just govern vote-by-vote
@JGForsyth he said no confidence and supply deal. That's nothing to do with SNP choosing to vote with Labour..
@JGForsyth why? Because the Tory media will lie about what he said?
@nickfaith82 @JGForsyth core Tory voters saying Ed was terrible. Core Labour voters saying Dave was terrible?
@JGForsyth I promise you, after any debate, no matter how it went, Tory pundits tweet about mythical "beaming confident Tories"
@JGForsyth either CCHQ feed you these lines, or you're highly skilled in spin yourself
@JGForsyth that's the cheesy CCHQ tweet I've read after basically every debate!
@JGForsyth Tories sort of think, if a Tory media employee says it, and they agree with it, it's real? No. It's not. Engage in mainstream
@Brian00081 @JGForsyth weren't they all abusing him?
@Brian00081 @JGForsyth hahaha classic
@JGForsyth is the momentum the 2% Labour lead in the poll that has just come out
@JGForsyth Tory media think if they say "momentum" that equals real momentum.....
@JGForsyth momentum? Do you actually believe there is any?
@JGForsyth @iainmartin1 fact Labour can lose 41 seats in Scotland and still have a very good chance of winning is a sad indictment of Tories
@JGForsyth @iainmartin1 Lets face it. Labour would be looking at a majority withouth the fall out of the indy ref.
@JGForsyth @iainmartin1 hilarious. I suspect it will be because they lost 41 seats in Scotland because of an indy referendum
@iainmartin1 @JGForsyth a Lib Dem forcing through unpopular Tory policies should get abuse.
@iainmartin1 Massive borrowing, boom and bust was the story of the 80s and 90s Tories!
@jfwduffield @iainmartin1 Thatcher borrowed just as much.
@iainmartin1 I doubt I'm the only child of the 80s and 90s who remembers having most of their classes in a portacabin with no heating!
@iainmartin1 and Labour inherited a toilet of a country. That needed massive spending. Poverty, horrible schools, horrible hospitals
@iainmartin1 Thatcher borrowed at 46% of GDP. Pretty much the same figure Brown did.
@iainmartin1 come off it Ian. We weren't in credit when Blair took over! Massive debt was built up for decades
@IainDale @TimMacpherson truth is, Farage is nowhere near as important as the Tory media like to pretend.
@IainDale @TimMacpherson he has 2 MPs and polls 12%. That's green party territory
@neilmonnery @jameshughes94 @IainDale Clegg obviously agreed not to go on to give Cameron cover.
@neilmonnery @jameshughes94 @IainDale if you make it clear you're not going, in the negotiations, they don't invite you!
@neilmonnery @jameshughes94 @IainDale come on Neil. That's the same line Cameron used. "i was not invited"
@IainDale @Nigel_Farage a party with 2 seats?
@DPJHodges For Ed to lose SNP would have to vote with Tories hahah
@DPJHodges Ed will just do vote-by-vote deals with left wing parties. As he probably always planned
@DPJHodges parliament need to vote 75% against him on a bill to force new election. That's basically impossible
@DPJHodges Ed doesn't need a deal with anyone. As long as he can get a Queens speech through he's basically stuck there for 5 years
@DPJHodges Dan, your Cameron's biggest fan but you don't understand his dopey fixed term parliament act?
@PaulDesproperty @DPJHodges Brandon. You need to change your "SUPER TORY!!" avater if you want anyone to take you seriously
@iamchica @DPJHodges you've spent all night flooding twitter with Milliband abuse!
@jameskirkup Levenson won't be that bad mate.
@jameskirkup neutral media reaction = about even. Tory media = Ed was terrible! Luckily nobody reads the Tory media any more
@brenkjm Tory Milliband attacks really have got obscenely desperate.
@brenkjm @jameskirkup has CCHQ told you all to highlight a slight stumble virtually nobody noticed
@jameskirkup your newspaper were always going to attack Milliband whatever he said. Everyone knows that. Why nobody listens
@jameskirkup story where? In highly partisan Conservative newspapers?
@jameskirkup come on James. CCHQ ask all Tory pundits to flood twitter with Cameron praise after every debate!
@iamchica @jameskirkup @pabmanjo nothing between Cameron and Ed at all. Ed arguably better
@iamchica @jameskirkup @pabmanjo these pre-written CCHQ tweets the Tory pundits are sending out are beyond pathetic
@DPJHodges when do you think Dan wrote this tweet? Hour before the show started?
@Taxpayer001 @DPJHodges you read too many right wing blogs mate. Nobody in the real world even saw it!
@GuidoFawkes Guido has nothing to say about Tories on this subject. Obviously.
@GuidoFawkes @DPTomDavidson Guidos such a sociopath. With a mental age of about 14. His therapy bills must be obscene
@GuidoFawkes you realize most people who agree with you are unemployed, lunatics
@GuidoFawkes funny, but I write on your tweets I always notice so many notorious, far right, twitter trolls already here!
@GuidoFawkes Guidos a sociopath I think
@GuidoFawkes You have to realize, looking at the polls, that your nasty brand of Tory attack politics doesn't really work any more....
@GuidoFawkes the thing is Paul is such a sociopath he thinks this matters.
@GuidoFawkes You'll get a pat on the head from Rupert for that one, you pathetic establishment sell out
@dmck52 @GuidoFawkes pity nobody reads the Sun any more. Barely over a million!
@GuidoFawkes well, until he started getting photoed with Michael Hintze and Lynton Crosby
@GuidoFawkes there was a time when Guido at least tried to pretend he wasn't part of the Tory Party establishment
@GuidoFawkes Rupert Murdoch told his Sun staff that unless they ramped up their Milliband attacks they're all fired!
@GuidoFawkes I bet Guido wrote this article hours before the debate
@GuidoFawkes when do you think CCHQ told Guido to write this?
@Lolc63 @GuidoFawkes so predictable Guido. You should at least try and reword the lines CCHQ send you.
@Lolc63 @DPJHodges replayed where exactly? Neither UKIP or the Daily Mail have a TV channel
@theamandaball @SiUttley @DPJHodges unless Ed vowed to reform Labour as the English Nazi Party,Amanda wouldn't have liked what he had to say
@SiUttley @theamandaball @DPJHodges  Amanda devotes most of her day to slagging off all left wing politicians.
@nickareay @DPJHodges take off your UKIP tinted glasses.
@CharloRoss as long as he can get a Queens speech through he's there for 5 years. SNP could never vote him down!
@CharloRoss 75% of MPs now need to vote against government to force an election! That's basically impossible.
@CharloRoss Thanks to Cameron's dopey fixed term parliament act he doesn't need a deal. Just govern vote by vote.
@CharloRoss didn't say that, did he. He said he wouldn't do a deal with them
@Gilesyb thanks to Cameron's gormless fixed term parliament act he doesn't need to do any deals
@timsculthorpe Bill basically won two elections on the back of that! Genius man.
@timsculthorpe you usually win by having the most memorable moment. Like when Bill Clinton walked into the audience.
@timsculthorpe Town hall formats are easy. Voters ask very predictable questions!
@May2015NS not exactly. Even pensioners rely on internet more!
@rayne_ea @MSmithsonPB @IpsosMORI  need a sample of closer to 6000 to get a accurate weekly poll.So I take the weekly average of all polls
@FT Let's be blunt, you're asking Libs to vote tactically, in the hope that the Tories can sneak a majority
@FT Any newspaper that seriously asks readers to vote tactically, has no respect for the UK, it's democracy or it's voters
@lionelbarber @FT any serious newspaper that's asking voters to vote tactically, has no respect for the UK or democracy.
@lionelbarber @FT you're very sneaky. Asking Lib Dems to vote tactically, could lead to a Tory majority. What you probably want
@GOsborneGenius well, both front pages attack Labour and tell their readers not to vote for them. So there is some method in the madness!
@GOsborneGenius @MSmithsonPB whether that's a stupid total or not will probably be revealed on election day.
@MSmithsonPB Fieldwork for Ipsos was Wednesday wasn't it? So yesterdays polls are later than Ipsos also
@EmilyPurserSky @skynewsniall they got the memo. But it was "do whatever you have to do to keep Ed out. He is going to break up News UK"
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB More to do with undecideds. And the allocation of them.
@WDave2013 @MSmithsonPB not really. Tories have been equal/behind on some polls, with UKIP polling 13%
