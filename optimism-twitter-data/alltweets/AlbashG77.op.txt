Mayweather landed 34% of the punches he threw while Manny threw only 19% of punches he threw.
Like one of the commentators said, "You don't have to Like him but You have to Admire his Boxing" #TMT
The fight wasn't even close to Controversial. #TMT
All this excuses, really unfair to Mayweather Man OutBoxed Manny hands Down. May is just too smart for any boxer. #48-0
LooL i read something about Mayweather giving judges Money to announce him. Haba that's not even credible. #TMT #48-0
@BARR102 there's no other place bro.
@khaleelouh nooo its just the truth we all watched the fight. Mayweather is a smarter Boxer. #48-0
He remains Unbeaten and perhaps Unbeatable #TMT #48-0 We did it Champ @FloydMayweather
There's no even doubt about the Win. All the former boxers interviewed said Money won hands down. #TMT
@BARR102 haba!! Noo theres no politics in this the crowd was not even with May. He simply Outboxed manny. Manny is a reckless fighter.
@BARR102 No Corruption oo. Floyd is just a very smart Boxer. #48-0
Floyd Outboxed Manny. It was so clear! #TMT #48-0
And Mayweather remains Money! #TMT #48-0
@honeychambs hehe Ofcourse!!

World Best Player. Untouchable stats. Laliga's Top, UCL's Top.Hatrick today.What more can i ask for from my idol.You are the BEST @Cristiano
Well that's a story for another day. #CR7
Some Weeks back, a player was hailed and praised for successfully nutmegging twice in a match. Ronaldo skilfully nutmeged but no hype. Why
Sometimes I feel only few of us Ronaldo fans know his numbers. Why? #CR7
5 consecutive Hatrick's against Sevilla for 5 consecutive Seasons. Who does that? Only one man he is @Cristiano #CR7
The home fans boo him when playing away for no reason but he is soo focused. Top Top fella @Cristiano #CR7
@Arafat__B wallahi bro. It's just too amazing. #CR7.
From Accomplishments to Accomplishments if you send him leg him go Jump am but he must SCORE you. #CR7
Check Raul's Goal to Game Ratio and Compare it to Ronaldo's as he is RealMadrids all time Record Scorer thats when you know who is CR. #CR7
It took this man @Cristiano just 6 seasons to achieve all this Untouchable numbers. It's so amazing. #CR7
Part of Ronaldo's Motivation to be the Best is from the so called "Hating" please haters, keep Hating.Thank you. #CR7 
@Arafat__B Untouchable #CR7
Ronaldo's 3rd, A very difficult angle but hey it's Ronaldo.. #CR7

Anything RONALDO does, makes the Headlines. That's enough to show how important he is and also a quality of a World Best player. #CR7
Manny's Speech was really humble just like he is. Guy is so Godly. But am still Team Mayweather.
World Best! 
If he Manny really was that good. He would have asked The Indonesian President to spare all the 9 of them to watch the match.
Bob Arum is talking shit.
So what's the big deal there?? Nawa oo
Ronaldo once said; he is a completely different person on the pitch, he is too serious and he shows his emotions when he scores or doesn't
Ronaldo's teammates don't really respect him.
I just don't know why everyone is attacking Ronaldo. This is his personality he has nothing against Arbeloa scoring his just mad at himself
Jese an Chicha. Two stupid dogs, paired with the World Best just check it out.
RONALDO well done. My man of the match.

Rock Star - BurnaBoy. I had to tweet some lyrics
and everybody seems nice to me
and the girl dema fight fi me
mi say the future looks bright to me
and rightfully my fans give life to me
its not the way i planned it.
In about 5 minutes i’ll be hitting the stage
and stealing the show, like I’m a bandit.
sing the lyrics to my song
Every time I sing a song, all the ladies sings along
and i still don’t understand it ,
I’m some kind of idol, my people do things that I do
i Become the guy all the girls wanna say hi to
and I don’t see nothing wrong,
You won’t see me have a lonely night
It might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ohhh I’m a rockstar baby
ohhhh I’m a rockstar baby
Oooh don’t you see that i came from dreams all day
before my head explodes, Umma just have to go with the flow
But I don’t care, stick my middle finger in the air
cause I don’t care, some-one make this very very clear.
I never wake up early, I gat that attitude like fuck you pay me
All my neighbours complain about the ladies, running around my mansion daily
When I wake up in da morning, whenever you see me yawning
I know that money is calling
cause me I go rich before morning.

Mayweather landed 34% of the punches he threw while Manny threw only 19% of punches he threw.
Like one of the commentators said, "You don't have to Like him but You have to Admire his Boxing" #TMT
The fight wasn't even close to Controversial. #TMT
All this excuses, really unfair to Mayweather Man OutBoxed Manny hands Down. May is just too smart for any boxer. #48-0
LooL i read something about Mayweather giving judges Money to announce him. Haba that's not even credible. #TMT #48-0
@BARR102 there's no other place bro.
@khaleelouh nooo its just the truth we all watched the fight. Mayweather is a smarter Boxer. #48-0
He remains Unbeaten and perhaps Unbeatable #TMT #48-0 We did it Champ @FloydMayweather
There's no even doubt about the Win. All the former boxers interviewed said Money won hands down. #TMT
@BARR102 haba!! Noo theres no politics in this the crowd was not even with May. He simply Outboxed manny. Manny is a reckless fighter.
@BARR102 No Corruption oo. Floyd is just a very smart Boxer. #48-0
Floyd Outboxed Manny. It was so clear! #TMT #48-0
And Mayweather remains Money! #TMT #48-0

Well that's a story for another day. #CR7
Some Weeks back, a player was hailed and praised for successfully nutmegging twice in a match. Ronaldo skilfully nutmeged but no hype. Why
Sometimes I feel only few of us Ronaldo fans know his numbers. Why? #CR7
5 consecutive Hatrick's against Sevilla for 5 consecutive Seasons. Who does that? Only one man he is @Cristiano #CR7
The home fans boo him when playing away for no reason but he is soo focused. Top Top fella @Cristiano #CR7
@Arafat__B wallahi bro. It's just too amazing. #CR7.
From Accomplishments to Accomplishments if you send him leg him go Jump am but he must SCORE you. #CR7
Check Raul's Goal to Game Ratio and Compare it to Ronaldo's as he is RealMadrids all time Record Scorer thats when you know who is CR. #CR7
It took this man @Cristiano just 6 seasons to achieve all this Untouchable numbers. It's so amazing. #CR7
Part of Ronaldo's Motivation to be the Best is from the so called "Hating" please haters, keep Hating.Thank you. #CR7

The Majority of people that Hate Mayweather is because of the Way he Flaunts his Wealth! LoL nigga Earned every single penny with HardWork.

Anything RONALDO does, makes the Headlines. That's enough to show how important he is and also a quality of a World Best player. #CR7
Manny's Speech was really humble just like he is. Guy is so Godly. But am still Team Mayweather.
World Best! 
If he Manny really was that good. He would have asked The Indonesian President to spare all the 9 of them to watch the match.
Bob Arum is talking shit.
So what's the big deal there?? Nawa oo
Ronaldo once said; he is a completely different person on the pitch, he is too serious and he shows his emotions when he scores or doesn't
Ronaldo's teammates don't really respect him.
I just don't know why everyone is attacking Ronaldo. This is his personality he has nothing against Arbeloa scoring his just mad at himself
Jese an Chicha. Two stupid dogs, paired with the World Best just check it out.
RONALDO well done. My man of the match.
@jikanMasani naaah his gesture said it clearly man. LoL
@jikanMasani he didn't claim it bro. Watch replay very well.
I hate you Jese.

Rock Star - BurnaBoy. I had to tweet some lyrics
and everybody seems nice to me
and the girl dema fight fi me
mi say the future looks bright to me
and rightfully my fans give life to me
its not the way i planned it.
In about 5 minutes i’ll be hitting the stage
and stealing the show, like I’m a bandit.
sing the lyrics to my song
Every time I sing a song, all the ladies sings along
and i still don’t understand it ,
I’m some kind of idol, my people do things that I do
i Become the guy all the girls wanna say hi to
and I don’t see nothing wrong,
You won’t see me have a lonely night
It might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ohhh I’m a rockstar baby
ohhhh I’m a rockstar baby
Oooh don’t you see that i came from dreams all day
before my head explodes, Umma just have to go with the flow
But I don’t care, stick my middle finger in the air
cause I don’t care, some-one make this very very clear.
I never wake up early, I gat that attitude like fuck you pay me
All my neighbours complain about the ladies, running around my mansion daily
When I wake up in da morning, whenever you see me yawning
I know that money is calling
cause me I go rich before morning.

You don't see real CR fans celebrating Ronaldo's brilliance at the detriment of Messi. #CR7. Its very unfortunate.
At the end of the day, it just shows how Ronaldo is the best! #CR7
Chai Chai Chai. Ronaldo don suffer mehn! #CR7
Why can't you just celebrate the joy he gives you without bringing Ronaldo in?? Pleasee!! #CR7
Messi makes two nutmegs, missed a penalty, gives an assisit over the two games, and then suddenly ronaldo is the next target! #CR7
Just going through my timeline. Abeg if no be say Ronaldo na nightmare why would you start comparisons based on todays game. #CR7

-My commentator
People are all acting as if it's a cliche thing to do. #CR7
When messi got the hatrick record. The tweets  was equivalent to that of a WorldCup win. Now Ronaldo does the same, gets Europe most goals
@alee_babr confirm. His Haters are just more than haters brahh. #CR7
@alee_babr abeg this isn't about farin jini. U needed to see Twitter last sunday.
 
1. Cristiano Ronaldo: 77 goals. 
2. Raul Gonzales: 76 goals. 
3. Messi: 76 goals. 
6 seasons with RealMadrid. Please check Ronaldo's numbers. It's just amazing. But people on here making him look like he can't pass the ball
Am not taking it seriously cuz Ronaldo and Messi will be switching the record cuz there's no gap. But it's still Ronaldo's atm. #CR7
It's soo sad. #CR7
Nobody is saying anything. Ronaldo has the Most goals in Europe Record!! Hahah i swear twitter bai yi ba. Its soo clear.
It was like ronaldo was behind with 30+ goals when it was only 4 goals. #CR7
Most goals in Europe. Ronaldo now has 77 which means it's his record now. When messi got the record this place was goong through stampede
6 seasons with madrid. 5 of the seasons with 40+ goals can also make it 50+ goals. #CR7
Commentator just said a record for CR OOO!! I know it's not relevant on here because its ronaldo. #CR7
