@Benkasso @iLoveKruise and may the most skilled hustler win.
I deserve your weed money musically lol

(With my new shit)

Wholly confident in that.
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso it's worth the investment that niggas usually spend on weed feel me? Lol
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso I just think it's all the hustle and if you believe in the music and know what you're getting out of the song
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso I'm anywhere between for the free to 150 rn. But if you ask me in a couple months that price can change
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso it all depends on the relationship to be honest. But I'm a working man ion believe in breaking people.
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise that I was in this in simply because I believe in there skill and reach
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise u should never need the verses fa sho. But I know a few guys who aren't huge or anything like that
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise like "oh shit you fw childish gambino"? Paid feature. If you have faith in that music acting can happen.
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise absolutely.  There are those features that happen "before the fame" it's an investment.
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise it's a want thing though, you don't purchase things out of necessity always right?
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso which actually helped me more than anything cuz now a whole nother genre of ppl fwm
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso they tapped into a market in the south that they didn't have before, I'd say so. The other were dubstep guys
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise gonna fo numbers because of who I know.
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise for instance, I know certain people, not naming names but if I pay for an (insert rapper name) verse then it's
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise unless you do your just die before you spend that type of money on a feature.
@iLoveKruise @Benkasso &amp; professional is someone who gets paid for their work I've gotten paid for verses therefore ___ feel me?
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise the song speaks for itself if it's great and you put in the ample work to get it in the right hands
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise do it. And as you gain the attention that price will be heavily justifiable
@SAGOgenesis lmao it was up to par? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise absolutely,  can charge a man an arm and a leg but if its money for skill it's justifiable. I agree though
The problem with charging for verses after you blow up is the weak ass niggas from your hometown saying you changed
@Benkasso @iLoveKruise does skill not constitute you behaving like a professional?

@MarieFromThe303 and it doesn't justify racism, I just think when you stand boldly behind a message there's bound to be conflict.
@MarieFromThe303 because he is very right when it comes to the truth that we as people in general have to respect ourselves to expect it

You really wanna impress somebody skillfully talk about your struggle and how the fuck you're going to change that bro.
@SavGod_ these niggas fatherless

Imaginary sauce?? Weird.‚Äù 

Ah‚Ä¶
@KillAllRoaches I appreciate that,  ima flex regardless but that shit fufu as hell bro
Basically,  you local ass niggas need to grind before you start talking that big shit like your peers not watching you hang yourself.
You don't need bands to make good quality music or to be fresh or the impress these hoes so who you fooling??
And stop fake stuntin talkin bout bands knowing damn well its a dream boi.

Imaginary sauce?? Weird.
Bottom line is put your money where your mouth is and stop feeling like you can flip n whip your way to rap starter rapping off your phone
Y'all local rappers gotta stop disrespecting the niggas that sell drugs to support a family that shit is not for fun.
But no. 

Last thing I want is a nigga trying to check me for my street cred when I know real solid niggas fuck with me.
I'm no hater bruh

But drugs are a VERY real lifestyle.

And God knows as many niggas as I know I could be out here frontin just like ya
You better take that fast food money and get some REAL studio time

&amp; talk about YOUR life

Not ya great granddaddy they used to sell opium
What possesses you to talk about dealing coke and you more than likely have never seen cocaine in your life??

AND Don't say Migos.
Niggas are weirdos.
STOP 
FRONTING
FOR
THE MIC!!!

Niggas die every day 4 the shit you playing about.
Honestly that drug rap funny until a nigga take you serious and quiz you on how well you know ya 36 my nigga.

Don't bitch up now.
AND CAN YOU NON-DRUG DEALING ASS NIGGAS STOP RAPPING ABOUT WRAPPING KEYS BRUH!!!!!!!!!!
I understand how hearing your voice back might sound really cool at the time but you're making it tough for people to take you serious.
Can't support music that isn't engineered properly because you obviously don't take your shit serious enough to put the money or the time in
Y'all make going to the studio out to be this impossible ass task but be rapping about bands when you make songs off your phone.

OK
Y'all gotta stop recording song off ya IPhones and Rockband mics!!!
Local rappers REALLY REALLY fucking up the scene rn bruh.

I know I'm a billion dollar man.

You don't.  

That's the difference between you and I.
I am weird.

Do not label me w/o knowing that I'm a sauced up nigga. 

Perception is not my reality.
