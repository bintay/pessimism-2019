It seems like I get bitched at no matter what. I'm not going take your money. Just chill.
My life just turned all around for the better
Never mind we all win
When your cop friend likes to play inappropriate jokes on you
I really hate to admit this but you're right, it is immature of me. I'm done with it, no more. Have a good life and I mean that.

Good morning everyone
I just want to thank this girl for giving me the best son anyone could ask for and just being there for me. 
Got a letter yesterday in the mail saying I have some unclaimed property. Calling about it first thing Monday morning. #goals #standards

This is going to be awkward as shit
I've had my closure and that's all I needed. Sometimes you just have to say things to push people away and make them hate you
I am going to go on record and make a bet. I bet within a month I know exactly who you will be with
I meant to say I don't understand why a girl would want to be with a younger guy.
The ex wife. Awkward running into her but it was nice at the same time. 
It looks like a little competition, I'm ready for a new challenge in my life
The people you run into
That was the push I needed a while ago.  I'm relieved cause nobody can I didn't try.
Captain's Place. At least now I can get a more affordable place and it's right next door. Easy move.
I wasn't the one. Deleted her off of all social media accounts so no contact. I gotta move on.
This is going to be hard to explain to my son
Having a fire all by my self, feeling alone

It's really that simple. #fuckyouericsheppard 
Draffenville smells horrible
I would just like to know what is going on in your head sometimes or even better, your true feelings.
Ok that was close. Just about took out three deer
Them boys are out extra deep in Benton right now. They must be trying to reach their quota. So if you out in town be careful
My weekend begins now
I was hoping things would be different than this
Off work early today. Heading back to the shop <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm really excited and happy to get to spend the evening with you and look for our own place <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
It's amazing how the smallest thing can put you in the best mood ever when you go to bed and wake. Loving life right now.
My job is the shit. Good money and a free tan lol
Finally home, getting a shower and relaxing
As weird as it is for me to say this but I like going to work early, I never have liked waking up early lol
I may living a boring life to some people but at least I'm focused on living a better life and be financially stable now


You should always show respect to people that show you the same respect
I don't want to just prove you wrong. I'm going to prove everyone wrong
When you do good in life then you really do get rewarded with happiness <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Going to bed at 10pm is going to take some getting use to but well worth it. #grownupproblems

I'm as bored as a prostitute in a ghost town
The things you see at these places
Fixing to go hang out with Jake and Hannah then out to Paducah for the night
That's a good feeling and memory to walk away on. Better leaving feeling a little bit of hope than feeling no hope at all #inmyfeelings
This narrows it all up 
I can't keep doing this to myself. I have to let go and go on with my life. I can't keep hurting myself.
Time for work. I like this so much better than changing shifts every week
I'll be just waiting for that goodbye text <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
This isn't going to end my favor anyways. I've pretty much already lost
Idk what to think about that
No more Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. It's not worth the risk to see something I don't want to see
Phones gonna die
Awkwardddddd
I'm going out this weekend to blow money on a bunch of drinks that I will regret buying later on lol #joysoflife

Is it 3pm yet? Lol
Work flow leggo #itslife #payday
Real men have a job and actually work
Idk which is worse, getting up early or working midnights. I like the afternoon shifts.

I feel lucky to have such a great person in my life that understands me and hasn't gave up on me as a human being.

I understand people find the friendship I have with my baby mamma weird but we understand each other like nobody else does. Mutual respect.
My long work week begins tonight.
If you don't have a job and your own car then you should probably reevaluate your life #prioritiesfirst

I'm really contemplating on getting this bike 
I've got to get ready for these midnight shifts. I love my job but not so much the midnights but the pay is good #prioritiesfirst

Lazy day off work since it's so beautiful outside. NOT lol. #TheStruggleIsReal
Since I'm nobody's MCM then I'm going to be my own. Idk what I would do without myself lol #ManCrushMonday 
Some might not like the old me but it's my life and I was much better the way I use to be #focused
The more I think about the person I have become then the more I realize that it's time I bring back the old me #feelingdetermined

I feel a lot better now. Time for some tv and to bed
What do you do when a person is going through a rough time and needs someone to talk to but you just don't know what to say
Lol I needed that after the day it has been. It's only gonna make me a better person in the end though. 

If it's not one thing then it's another. I swear you can't have one peaceful day in this county #overit

Ready for weekend. I hope it's nice enough for a bonfire at the house.
I'm really thinking hard about deactivating my Facebook and Twitter. Social media is just full of drama and causes too many problems
So true 
I'm ready for the weekend
I'm ready to be off work and enjoy the night. My sleep schedule is going to be so messed up lol

You're fucking insane

My son says some of the funniest things lol
Naw I'm good now. Back to reality, my life is great the way it is.
My head is so fucked up now, too much to take in this past week
@shawtyky00 And you belong in an insane asylum.
Starting today I'm letting go of things that belong in the past. Stopping with the hopes cause there's a reason for it being called the past

I'm more pissed at myself
Cleaning out the house. Then picking up in the yard. Pool party this weekend.
Laying down watching some Netflix before work
Having dirt on the people that have done you wrong is like having money in the bank. You just sit back and wait until you need it.


Not much of a morning person
Shit, house would be put up for sale! 
Pool is up and ready 
Never downgrade, only upgrade

Coincidence? 
The cat and mouse games begin.

The time is always right to do what is right
I think "dildo" is the acceptable insult. I would just call you a dick but you aren't real enough
I wish people felt like I deserve the truth instead of lying, hiding, and sugar coating the truth. I might be a different today if so
I have the feeling it's gonna be a long night.



It's not what you do for people that counts, it's who is there for them when they really need someone
@savannaxlouise Not me though!
I hope everyone has a safe and a happy New Years.

If you have someone that cares for you and you continuously do them wrong. Wake the fuck up dumbasses and do right. You won't do any better
