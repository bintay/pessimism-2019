@dailytroye_ my decorating skills are great..
I made a cake:D :o definitely wasnt from a packet I swear... 
Just ate bread because I felt like It... I stg im so stupid sometimes why do I do this to myself:L
I really like my garden.. idk its just really nice to look at and quite asthetically pleasing,i think it is anyway. 
Bingo at my brothers school is going to be the most boring way to spend my Friday night. Seriously need to get some friends
in the mood to socialise.. Idk why but I am and this is where I realise I have no friends..and I'm instead going to bingo with my family..
Its not even gone that dark this is so disappointing
Soz about the updates on the solar eclipse but the next 'full' one I will be 90 so deal with it;)
We only get 87% tho how sad.
Its getting so dark. This is getting kinda scary ngl.
Theres literally just signs on the field that say 'dont look directly at the sun' k thanks
This Is fun dont look at the sun you'll burn your retina;)
Cant stop shaking and I feel like I'm going to pass out! Again. My maths teacher shouldn't do this to me. Honestly this is how bad she is
@dailytroye_ but I'm so drained rn I can't even think straight
@dailytroye_ like I'm literally crying because Im so stressed and my math teacher is horrid and going to have a go at me for not getting it.
@dailytroye_ idc if ur going to give me extra work until I can eventually understand the quadratic formula, i can't do it. Its not my fault
Ive literally been doing revision and maths homework since i got home four hours ago andi i can't do it.
I want to go home now. I cant do this anymore<WEARY FACE>
7 days left. Come on you can do it...
@ZachZachary96 yep
Do you ever just remember how lonely you are and remember that you actually have no friends and no one cares because same
Why do you have to always ruin everything?? I was finally happy. When will you just give up and find your own friends
Everyone manages to replace me and im done even bothering to try and be nice and keep any friends bc im obviously not good enough for anyone
You can't say you hate someone doing a certain thing and then go and do that thing, that's not how it works ffs
I'm going to fail my mocks but oh well as long as I don't fail the actual exams.. I just really can't do science
Feel like I'm about to pass out!! Yes then, just what I needed

Mum left me home alone so I gave to cook my own food and I'm so incapable...
Fml today is just getting worse and I've already cried I'm so done atm
I have a German speaking today and i haven't learnt any of it..
Ffs now I cant stop crying again:( I need to stop pretending im okay because im not
Tired and sad, might aswell just sleep
Just done the intense workout again this time it wasn't that good and it felt horrible, feel like shit rn
If I could stop crying now that would be fantastic
I cant think straight rn how am I supposed to learn my german speaking by tomorrow:(
Fml, this has honestly put me back in to reality. I'm a mess rn:(
Omfg Madonna falling made my night that was so funny. Im Such a bad person but it was hilarious
Not worn makeup in ages,its the best decision I've ever made bc not only does it feel great but my skin is so smooth&amp;clear, its just great:)
Can't decide whether to carry on watching the Brits or watch glee... I have a dilemma
Kind of didn't even realise it was the Brits already.. Oops
Shit in going to be late... oh well
I actually hate my biology teacher so much and I stg if she make me and my friend split up for talking i'm going to be so angry fml

Although a really intense workout was actually quite fun and motivating I am now so tired I literally have no energy and feel like shit:L
I wrote a two page rant about how rude adults are in five minutes, when I start to have a rant it just flows, you know.
This video.. I just can't.my actual faves, life changing. 
Just did a thirty minute intense workout to make up for all the oreos I ate today bc my diet was gong really well:L
So tired, no way am I going to make it through this week. How is it only Monday:(
@JamesMathewPine are you drunk:L
Straightened my hair for the first time in forever but I'm still not going to wear make up bc I don't want to.
So glad my first lessons drama bc that doesn't make me want to cry that much.
Already done with today and I only just woke up
Really excited to go back to school tomorrow and be told i Have to many piercings and my socks arent the right colour! Yay!
There is no way I will wake up tomorrow and walk to school in time

Just thought id have a little rant about that because that has genuinely been said to me so manytimes and it upsets me more that anything<WEARY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><PISTOL>
-thing ive ever had to deal with throughout my whole life and when people say about not saying and things about my dad they can stfu.
-me for that i think it might be a good idea to learn about my family history and learn exactly why i hate my dad so much, its the hardest-
-like yes i do realise i am a lot luckier than others for actually having my dad alive/well and i do know that but honestly before youjudge-
do you know what pisses me off more than my dad? When people say to me 'omg dont say those things about your dad atleast you have a dad'ect-
