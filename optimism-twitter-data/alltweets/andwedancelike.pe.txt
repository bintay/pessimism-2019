Keep your own opinions to yourself thank you <ANGRY FACE>
In the bath and I never want to get out
What I've learned from that chemistry exam is

No matter how much revision you do

It will never be enough
So how many people are saying they're going to fail but they're actually going to ace it and how many people are genuinely going to fail
Exams got me like 
@Lauren_Allngton BAE
I haven't seen corrie for so long because of revision taking up all my time I think I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms
@ClariceCornish putting are we at the end of a fact to make it sound like an insult are we
I got 11 hours sleep, that's like the most sleep I've ever had

What am I going to do with all this free time
I JUST COUNTED HOW MANY WEEKS I HAVE OFF FOR SUMMER AND I HAVE 13 WEEKS OFF OMG
ur right, it'd be chrita
How can I have a good Christmas if I need to revise
"Have a good Christmas" my teachers said
Surely I don't have to revise on Christmas Day?
I'm actually up early for a change wow
Mugs and Yankee candles
Honestly for Christmas I just want more mugs
@Fern_Kimberly hahaha it's his own fault
@Fern_Kimberly my mum did that :')
I'm so socially awkward and it's becoming a problem
Christmas was a lot better when I was younger
I never properly get into the Christmas mood <PENSIVE FACE>
@sozlozz @Ayemie_ love this
@vickyzinzan84 aww no problem <FACE THROWING A KISS> ly2 x
Shaving legs is so much EFFORT
@ClariceCornish paying £10 a month for spotify is probably cheaper
@iTunesMusic STOP BEING SO EXPENSIVE
I'm spending way too much on iTunes omg
One direction came third and look where they are now
Andrea will most likely do better than the others though so it's okay
That's just set me off crying again
NOOOOOO
Ed Sheeran makes me cry
How come Cheryl and Tulisa are judging a singing competition when they can't sing a note in tune?
OH GOD HE IS SO PERFECT
I AM LITERALLY CRYING WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
Tulisa's lips look dreadful
The X factor final is a bit pointless now cause they're all gonna do well regardless
ANDREA IS SUCH A CUTIE
Christmas shopping = done <WHITE HEAVY CHECK MARK>
Put cinnamon in my hot chocolate and now I feel Christmassy
@Lauren_Allngton bring a flask next time
@Lauren_Allngton aw bae drink some tea
@Lauren_Allngton oh sorry

Well chilled

Wish I could see Michael McIntyre live he's hilarious
I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO BRING ME ENDLESS CUPS OF TEA
I cry at the Waitrose advert every time it comes on TV, it's not even sad or anything I'm just WAY too emotional
My nose is cold
FOGGY FOGGY FOGGY
He can sing in tune which is more than you can say for Cheryl Cole lol
People need to stop slating Andrea, he is by far the best out of anyone who's ever been on X factor

You know you're stressed out about something when your thumb looks like this <WEARY FACE> 
When they start to play it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas on the radio you know Christmas is coming <FATHER CHRISTMAS><CHRISTMAS TREE><WRAPPED PRESENT>

Getting a cold is the best way to start half term <UNAMUSED FACE>
My sister's just going to bed and I'm getting up omg
The song Fancy has made me realise how many times teachers say "first thing's first" in lessons omg
As "hilarious" as it is to make fun of someone/put them down, the person on the receiving end is not going to find it funny so please stop
Ughhh so done with school
@CLARICECORNISH they were hella nice
Crumpets are seriously the nicest things ever
1AM NACHOS

There's no food in the house so I've resorted to eating Weetos
My dad always compares me to other people
@cayte_milligen DID YOU WATCH CORRIE
CORONATION STREET WAS INTENSE
I really like Pentatonix
Honestly cutting your wrists because of what celebrities do is ridiculous and immature and should not be happening
It's so awkward when you attempt to start a conversation with someone and they DON'T REPLY

Ed Sheeran's verse is by far the best in Epic Dreamers Remix I love it so much

Had to abandon my breakfast cause someone came to the door and I'm in my pyjamas
Tbh you're lucky if your dad isn't a piano teacher and there aren't people coming to the door every 5 minutes
Nobody wants a punch in the face cause when you get punched in the face it hurts

@Fern_and_Jack I see you added more people to your name
@RizzleKicks you are me I am you we are one
@Ewoodley2001 i know :( x
And then when I was a youngster played on the ceremony I was so happy

@THEparadiddle it's a good song what can I say
@RizzleKicks so @natalie_bang is on tour with you - does that mean Jordan won't do his typical wear a wig and put on a girl voice this year?
So I need to do my citizenship
Video has been uploaded :) RIP Millie x 
@sozlozz ily too x
Can I just have thick wavy hair and a nice face and cheekbones and a flat stomach and toned thighs and a nice smile please
Can miss mcgowan refrain from giving us maths homework every lesson
And I overthink everything way too much
I just find it annoying how people can say such horrible things and it affects the person they say it to but it doesn't affect them at all
Can't help but think of things people have said to upset me, but it makes me even more upset and I end up disliking that person more
Hey @TheVampsJames please please please can you follow @Fern_and_Jack because she loves you so much and she's been trying so hard x
Putting millie's video on youtube, I'll put a link up in a bit
Must sort out my sleeping pattern
Mikill Pane, king of instagram captions
People can be so insensitive sometimes :( yes I get the hint you don't care but you could at least pretend to
R.I.P Millie. You were the best dog in the whole world, thank you for an amazing 11 years &lt;3 
Lana Del Rey is gorgeous
'MyMaths - Bringing Maths Alive' nah I'm pretty sure maths has always been a dead subject
RIZZLE KICKS HAVE THEIR OWN FLAVOUR OF POPCHIPS THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER

Sorry @Fern_and_Jack but I updated twitter and I actually like it better than the old one
I find it annoying when people make another twitter account just so they can retweet themselves
@thesamball haha it's fine I wasn't looking for a retweet, otherwise you'd be contradicting yourself
I can sleep in the car I guess
There is no way I'll be able to wake up tomorrow morning
@thesamball your tweets are brilliant
@Roisin_McCay AW YAY

Was it a dream or were rizzle kicks supposed to be on the jonathan ross christmas special today but it wasn't on?
Is my skin ever going to be good
@RizzleKicks are you okay
@Fern_and_Jack WE CAN DO THIS
In all seriousness, I'm going to get fit in the new year because I really need to
Mum's bringing me food #happyemma
If you think about it January 2013 seems like yesterday, you had people tweeting "this and this happened and we're only 14 days into 2013"
NEVER TRUST THE WII FIT THE WII FIT IS A LIAR
You confuse me so much
Don't see why people feel the need to lie all the time about stupid things, just tell the truth?
