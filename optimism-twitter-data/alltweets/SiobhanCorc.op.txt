@HywelV2 ??? why would that change anything?
@HywelV2 hmm,think I might agree.Would stop people getting confused between seats needed for majority rather than % under current system too




National Demo #EndAusterityNow
Saturday - June 20 

@rustyrockets @ch…
@leerichards10 me neither, but they still have a right to protest. It would be better off if they left it at being simply for anti austerity
@leerichards10 they still have the right for their voices to be heard without being demonised, this is supposed to be a free society.
@leerichards10 the tiny minoirty that were intent on violence undermine the message of those that were there (2/2).
@leerichards10 even the police have acknowledged vast majority were peaceful, we should be looking at reasons behind it, not letting (1/2)
@HywelV2 true. I'm now more concerned about Human Rights.
@HywelV2 aye but Gove?he's a complete incompetent.Damage he's done to education in England so bad it may not b possible to reverse all of it
@HywelV2 aye but Labour hardly put up a fight. Madness. And now look what we have, look at what Gove has been put in charge of!

@HywelV2 I think people have believed Conservative lies about the economy, what I don't get is why Labour didn't fight them over it.
@HywelV2 I think they do, but the differences they probably don't view as 'right/left'. Most people don't think along political terminology.
@ollyisthebest for many people, including most vulnerable, things were a lot better under Labour. People are genuinely fearful of the Tories
Why can't everyone see this story? #ToriesOutNow 
my eyes!!!  
@BBCNews really isn't impartial is it? and I thought @BBCWalesNews was bad during all the rugby politics last year! Little did I know...
@HywelV2 @PVickerton I'm telling you, Britain has gone crazy!
@ollyisthebest considering most of London voted Labour, I think maybe they do!
@BrianRhys @AndySlagg George Osbourne's going to have two roles now?
2)Right NOW in London, BBC not covering it

#fuckthetories &amp; #fuckthebbc <ANGRY FACE> 
@HywelV2 hahaha! Britain is going crazy.
@HywelV2 blimey!
@HywelV2 hahahaha! maybe. I still don't see UKIP having that much influence on Tories. The kippers have stolen votes form LD's and Lab!
@HywelV2 referendum has been a big part of Tory party and problem for Tory party long before UKIP. Look at Major and Portillo etc.
@HywelV2 well yeah, they weren't in power.
@HywelV2 but it's been mooted on the Tory agenda going a lot further back then that.
@HywelV2 you aren't making much sense to me now!  :)Tories wanted referendum, nothing to do with ukip "influence" I don't think.
@HywelV2 Tories have talked about a referendum long before rise in popularity of ukip.
@HywelV2 the referendum isn't about ukip. Conservatives have spouted on about it for yrs.
@HywelV2 no they aren't. They know under current system UKIP can't get seats, it's why they've been dismissing them as irrelevance for 5yrs
@TimAlunWilliams @HywelV2 only in marginal seats though really.
@HywelV2 I don't see the problem with that if it means the views of everyone are represented.
@HywelV2 when is the last time a party got over 40%?
@HywelV2 why wouldn't they be able to govern though? It would just be a progressive politics, current model outdated.
@HywelV2 and? Currently we have a system where 63% didn't vote for the party that's now in power!
@HywelV2 that's relevant to Britain how?
@HywelV2 no it suits a two party nation and we aren't a two party nation anymore. It's outdated (imho).
@HywelV2 in this area of Wales in the assembly - 4 plaid, 3 lab, 3 con and 2 Lib Dem. I'd say that's fair. It does work.
@HywelV2 this is also a good read: 
@HywelV2 not for what they actually want. Every vote should count. With FPTP it doesn't.
@HywelV2 I don't know but it certainly works. Our system isn't fair, it's not representative and it forces people to vote tactically and
@HywelV2 Germany have only had one majority government since the war, they don't seem to do too badly out of coalitions.
@ChrisBryant4MP @wru4me @CapS45 all it's time? It really didn't.
@HywelV2 they also needed to say more than just trying to secure fair funding as most don't believe it's deliverable.
@HywelV2 their immigration line may have hurt them most, because it's a false fear that ukip prey on so well.
@HywelV2 big test will be assembly elections, but results were disappointing overall for GE.
@RobLloyd2 @sport_swep arse, I really hoped they would have managed a contract for him.

@Rubbish_No3 @Baramenyn how can anyone criticise that?? it's a great crowd!
Diolch yn fawr iawn Dreigiau! we need to finish the job off on Sunday now #ymlaen #Scarlets
@eirianwyn she says, begrudgingly.... ;-)
Fair play, very well done by Rhys Webb.
@ccurts2 @wru4me @BarrieJones no we actually need to get them as  Silk Commission recommended,not crumbs offered by St Davids announcement
@HywelV2 @the_black_otter it's totally apt, all four slang versions ;-) 
@ccurts2 @wru4me @BarrieJones no he's got a point re: Labour. I actually think Carwyn would like to have done more but not allowed.
@the_black_otter no,no,party politics is when a few ponces tell every1 else what to do,no one is supposed to actually believe in anything...
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones It's a Labour disease. They didn't address the issues in Scotland over a number of years - and now look.
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones Plaid have, Labour not interested. Didn't you listen to Owen Smith in the first Wales Debate?
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones and how would you make it the centre? if with investment then with what money?
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones we need mass investment in our infrastructure first.
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones we don't have the powers to create it currently, so how are we going to?
@ccurts2 that was  one of my concerns for Plaid but I believe in their ideologies. Labour I don't trust and the Conservatives terrify me.
@ccurts2 I've never advocated a vote for Labour in Wales. And I think Tory cuts will hurt far more.
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones so did Plaid though. Everyone did in Wales bar a massive crash for the Lib Dems!
@ccurts2 @BarrieJones that's not much better! (although at least you're honest about it!)
@ccurts2 ...playing field first. We do get more but that's because of the issues in the country i.e. v rural areas, decimated industry
@ccurts2 I want Wales to have more powers to generate its own income. Only Plaid is asking for that. But we need to be put on a level...
@BarrieJones @ccurts2 plus we've had 5 years of demonising foreigners in the media and UKIP play very well on people's fears.
@BarrieJones @ccurts2 depressing isn't it, but I think it's a cry for help. Tories won't help them, Labour have failed them.
@ccurts2 I don't. I blame Labour in Wales. I think they're utterly useless.
@ccurts2 we've been underfunded by £300 million a year.
@ccurts2 that West Wales is the poorest region in the whole of northern Europe?
@ccurts2 it's pleading for an extra hand out, it was for us to get a fair share, you *do* realise our country is underfunded right?
@ccurts2 nice insult to me there cheers Chris, I didn't consider my intelligence insulted at all by Plaid.
@ccurts2 ...there'll be serious questions for them too. Gaining a seat in the GE was always going to be tough,
@ccurts2 I think everyone needs to look at why UKIP has done so well (%age wise). If PC don't do well in the AM elections nxt year then..
If #WelshLabour continue with the same stance, ultimately the same will happen to them here as in Scotland.
I think this reflects on politics in Wales quite well. And it's not good.  
@Sarraelgan @QuinsRugbyUnion always tuth!
So first result in 1. Lab, 2. UKIP  3. Con!! UKIP have overtaken Cons?! #SunderlandSouth
@AndySlagg yes, lung cancer I think.
@AndySlagg cancer treatment.
@OwainDavies15 Well, I guess I'll know more when I wake up at about 4.30am! I go to sleep in trepidation....
@OwainDavies15 If results end up reflecting it I think I may genuinely cry.
CON - 284
LAB - 263
SNP - 48
LDEM - 31
UKIP - 2
GRN - 1
#TheVote
@TimAlunWilliams @Tircoeds I think last 3 elections it's been right?
@davidbogle1 they're not often wrong. UKIP voters changing last minute, LD's decimated.....fuck.
@serenab_ snap! going to try and go to bed in a bit but I think i'm too outraged by the exit poll to be able to sleep!
@Tircoeds they're usually spot on. I am now genuinely really, really worried.
@ccurts2 shy tory syndrome, because of course no idiot wants to admit to voting for them! If results match it....Britain is screwed.
Just seen the exit poll. Fucking shit.
@serenab_ see if you can catch it on +1?
#TheVote is absolutely brilliant. Judy Dench  - fabulous!
@RhianCorcoran re-tweet it, it can be your one and only tweet!
@eirianwyn of course! #Plaid15 #plaidcymru
Amber's first General Election! #DogsAtPollingStations 
@tumblescarlet67 @serenab_ @haydn_davies @rugbyPhilBB see now I'm just feeling left out!
@rugbyPhilBB @haydn_davies dim clue. Where'd you get it from Haydn?
@haydn_davies yep from this: 
@davidbogle1 I must admit I don't have much (if any) understanding of NI politics at all, I just know that the DUP are frightening.
@davidbogle1 there'll be v little change here. LD lose 2, Con lose 1 pick up 1, Lab gain 2 I think.
@davidbogle1 hmm not sure. Could possibly get Ynys Mon and Ceredigion. Should keep their current 3 (but 2 aren't wholly safe)
I hope people remember when the results are in it's not the % of vote that matters, but the number of seats. 323 the magic number #GE2015
Why I'm voting Plaid Cymru tomorrow 
Very much hoping that @JonathanPlaid regains his seat after tomorrows election - people of Carmarthen East and Dinefwr - make it so.
Don't be a fucking idiot on Thursday. Check out this sweary, angry yet accurate report on the Coalition 
@rava_ian @Variety hahaha that's brilliant!
I got "Arya Stark" on "Which Game of Thrones Character Are You?" What about you? 
@GazNoTan if this had come up about a year ago, I reckon I'd have applied!
One moment worthy of note: Jaime looking longingly at the Island of Tarth! Someone is missing Brienne.. #GoTAtlantic
Speechless! #GOTAtlantic
Oh bloody hell, stupid internet, think I just missed a really crucial conversation in #GoTAtlantic ! What did Littlefinger say to Sansa?!
@eirianwyn @EnfysJones1 love it! can't wait now #scarletsontour
Let this be a reminder to myself to avoid writing up a revision time table! 



#RedDwarf
@Penddol nah I'm gutted I got it cut earlier on in the week now, could have used that guy as my inspiration...
@GerardYNWA @danpowledge @simonrug Cardiff have, &amp; I guess Scarlets might count too, we won league 1st season we switched to four pro sides
Submitted last piece of work for the 2nd yr of my MA today, super chuffed. A month of revising now &amp; then maybe I'll get a social life back
@RHIAN_MAI they're so pretty! have you named all of them? I'd find it so hard to tell the difference!
@DeadpanMarc just seen your earlier tweets,so sorry to hear that your Dad's so unwell,I know it's just words but thinking of you and yours

BRIDGEND HAVE WON THE CUP
What a final! Really brilliant from both sides but wow, seriously well done Bridgend!
gah, two kicks out on the full, Bridgend just piling pressure back on themselves.
Bloody hell, that's a shocking hair cut on the Bridgend 23.
YES!!! Try for Bridgend!! Deserved, they've made the fewer errors so far this 2nd half. Ymlaen Penybont!
@RygbiS4C @yclwbrygbi y bydd e'n bwysig i dweud faint o chwaraewyr Caerdydd sydd mewn tim Ponty heddi?Dim chwaraewyr Gweilch yn tim Penybont
Interesting to see how many Cardiff Blues players are in #Pontypridd team today,anyone know if #Bridgend have Ospreys players in their team?
@vaughany9 he had a very very good game up to about 60 mins.
I hate to say it, but CNE full back...not had the best last 15 mins :-(
@haydn_davies it really was wasn't it! never a penalty!
you see. Bugger. But great fight back form Ystrad Rhondda - what a match!
a crap, that's exactly where you don't want to knock the ball on!
Gem dda iawn rhwng Ystrad Rhondda a Castell Newydd Emlyn ar @yclwbrygbi
@RHIAN_MAI blimey! I'd never be able to keep track of all of them!
@RHIAN_MAI sounds it! how many of them do you have now?
What a finish!  Great foot work to keep in field!
@RHIAN_MAI you've not had more fish homicides, have you?
Another Williams family special turnover there!
wow! What a try from the Ystrad Rhondda full back!
Pob lwc i @ClwbRygbiCNE heddiw! #westisbest


@evilwelshbird how come? they're an amazing club.
Gutted but my god Clermont don't help themselves! Absolutely fantastic final #ChampionsCup
Why did you kick it away?!?!
Step and acceleration, pure lush.
hooooooly cow. Try. That was a great run, but some of those tackle attempts should have been completed.
oho! How close was that from Toulon? Clermont seriously, their restarts all game have been absolutely shocking.
Oh you have to be kidding me!  ...right? surely no try?
Makes up for his crap arse chip before HT!
What a try!! Perfect chip over, just fell perfectly for him, really really hope this is a legitmate try, all of Clermont's work paid off.
@evilwelshbird Parra's been fine, was great first half, Lopez a much bigger problem I reckon.
Rougerie! Mr Clermont himself.
Giteau should have ran there, huge gap opened up in front of him!
Sublime performances from some of the Toulon forwards, really great hands.
gargh Clermont! Catch a bloody restart will you?
Bugger, right on HT, Clermont would have done better to kick it out than chip ahead, perfect counter attack rugby from Toulon.
Clermont really really need to sort out catching the restarts. Scrums a bit wobbly too, gifting chances back to Toulon.
Great pressure from Parra for that.
Fofana!! Charge down and sprint in, pure lush.
Two of the best clubs I've ever come across, going head to head, bloody love it #Toulon #Clermont #EuropeanChampionsCup #YellowForADay
@CardiffBluesSC not really. Going to have to agree to disagree!
@CardiffBluesSC give off! 9pm-ish I'd give you but not that! :-)
@CardiffBluesSC I dunno,  it's not that late a kick off! good point about Sunday though I guess, such a shame it's not a Sat match.
@CardiffBluesSC @scarlets_rugby why returning straight after? shame when there's such a great supporters facility at the stadium to use.
Got my Clermont scarf on especially today, really hoping @ASMOfficiel can win later!
@tisiphone09 ha if you like, it's really not my best though! This one's all to do with the otherworldly characteristics :-)
Essay pretty much done! just got to chuck in a couple extra quotes, and fine tune my referencing #CelticStudies #YMabinogi #hapus
@alunj92 @GazNoTan I don't know what happened to her tonight, she was much better last week. Really not good.
@GazNoTan @alunj92 it's the same UK over, the areas with least immigration have highest % voting for UKIP - bonkers!
@GazNoTan @alunj92 they did very well here in Sir Gar in the euro elections (frighteningly so!).
@GazNoTan @alunj92 ^ this is also true.
@alunj92 @GazNoTan mm I think for a lot they are still a protest vote as they feel their real vote would be wasted under current system.
@alunj92 @GazNoTan aye, he needs to learn to cut across the politicians' waffle a bit more though!
@GazNoTan @alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru I know, mad isn't it? Some crazy Tory supporters on the radio wales phone in too!
@GazNoTan @alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru I don't think Plaid have ever said they by themselves can make a difference, always been in conjunction :)
@BevanJa @Plaid_Cymru really? I thought it was more them highlighting how Labour have taken Wales for granted.
@alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru @GazNoTan aye I guess so, Labour in the last 24hrs have screwed up, unless they wriggle out of it on a technicality.
@alunj92 @GazNoTan @Plaid_Cymru I reckon 5 is possible (being hugely optimistic), but I'll be very happy if they get 4.
@alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru See that's where we differ, if Labour actually start thinking straight then it's a definite possibility.
@GazNoTan @alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru plus their aim is obviously to get more than 3 (whether that'll become reality or not is a diff question!)
@GazNoTan @alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru no, in conjunction with other smaller parties mun, that's what Plaid have said all along.
@alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru in cooperation with the Greens and the SNP Alun.
Where are you finding these strange Conservative people?! @BBCRadioWales
@alunj92 @Plaid_Cymru perhaps not crucial but the more there are the more chance they have of having some influence, that's obvious surely?
@alunj92 @OwenSmith4MP yes they've paid a lot of £££ for one from America, but then so have the Tories, And look where we are!
@alunj92 @OwenSmith4MP yeah they definitely didn't spend it wisely, (although I don't agree they caused the economic crisis!)
@alunj92 that bit was but there were some very good points raised by the audience more so than the politicians!
@paulhalliday she finished well but was v. poor to start, never a good idea to directly ignore a question from the audience! #WalesDebates
Tough gig tonight fielding all those questions but job well done @huwbbc! #WalesDebates
Yes #Labour, why won't you work for a progressive parliament? #WalesDebates
@haydn_davies he's not moaning about immigration, take that our of UKIP and *some* of what they say isn't actually that bad (only some!)
Hugely important comment re: mental health by the audience, ditto re: aging population #WalesDebates
@RogerPinney it's not just you! I think it's a good thing though.
DO you know what, I don't think even Crabb believes this rubbish he's spouting #WalesDebates
loving tonight's audience, when will some of the politicians take the hint and answer the questions though? #WalesDebates
oh Pippa! #owngoal #WalesDebates
@ccurts2 seriously?! they're going to chuck it away! legitimate reds?
10x more spent on chasing benefit fraud than tax evasion under current government, this when we lose 3x more to tax evasion! #WalesDebates
Crabb has lost the audience already #WalesDebates
Passion personified, got to love Pippa! #WalesDebates
@daf1999 oh definitely, I don't find him credible at all, but he is doing better than the debate on itv (that's not hard though!)
Well, fair play Owen Smith is doing much better tonight than the previous debate! #WalesDebates
Kirsty Williams, blatantly disregarding what the lady asked, really poor #WalesDebates
Answer the bloody question! I swear no Conservative candidate is able to do so #WalesDebates
Crabb what planet are you living on if you think Wales is getting stronger? Last 5 years we've been hit so hard #WalesDebate
@bethanjenkins ha I reckon so!
@bethanjenkins haha snap!
Yes, tuned in just in time for the debates! More Pippa madness, can't wait #WalesDebates
IfG: The (Not So) Fixed-term Parliaments Act 
@eggynewydd the one on about Welsh not being taught in schools because of the EU? barking!
@Amanwy @gwladrugby @BBCRadioWales @LauraMcAllister @cathy_owens or are you just going to claim they "started" the process?

@davidbogle1 to be fair Stormont isn't that far off. Senedd is way behind though, agree re: federal but raises all sorts of funding issues.
@Penddol as tempting as that was(!) I somehow managed to resist...
@LGBow aye I've made a note of it, definitely looks worth a trip :)
@LGBow that cheese selection looks incredible!
@davidbogle1 hey good on you! I didn't manage to make any of my local ones, you shall have to let me know what one's like1
Long overdue haircut tomorrow and I still don't know what style to go for! Will probs end up with something I don't like #standard
@ccurts2 I think the changes they are making are good, but now I don't like not knowing what's going to happen!

@scarlets_rugby @Philjprop wonderful news!
@rugbyPhilBB ha I know you don't agree with me :) still,better to be discussing it at all than the apathy that's usually present re politics
@rugbyPhilBB @SouthTerracer @simonrug his blog articles are usually a lot better than this offering.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 It isn't their sole purpose though, and that's an important point that I'm not sure you're fully considering.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 that isn't their current aim Phil, nor is it something they are looking at in the short term.
@rugbyPhilBB right now what supporting PC is about is a call for Wales to have more accountability+/control instead of being dictated to
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 it's something they want but I'm not sure if realistically we'll ever be in the position for it.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 in a hung parliament that won't matter so much, the smaller parties can make a diff if they get enough MP's.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 they'll remain outnumbered unless people start voting for them. Without that there'll never be change.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 you don't know that Phil.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons so they should what, just not try? I really don't understand your view point on this Phil.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 and it may very well not be.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons It needs it in both the Assembly and WM.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 current set up shows a complete lack of ambition under Labour and just more of the same, it's not good enough
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons it's marginalised by both. Wales does need individuals that will fight for us to get what we deserve.
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons our country being marginalised and ignored with those in power now not willing to speak up for us (2/2)
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons if no one speaks up we'll never get it. I don't think it'll happen over night. I'm just fed up of (1/2)
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons I can't see how.PC will fight for more powers,Labour ignored near all recommendations of silk commision
@rugbyPhilBB @HelenP3617 @mumphtoons for me it's simple, stick to status quo or vote for people that will put Wales 1st.
@rugbyPhilBB @mumphtoons @HelenP3617 in Wales? from Plaid Cyrmu, and perhaps the Lib Dems if they get their arses back in gear.
@rugbyPhilBB @mumphtoons @HelenP3617 not sure I agree. I think they need stronger voices to hold them to account at the very least.
@rugbyPhilBB @mumphtoons @HelenP3617 the current Welsh Labour aren't using it very well then.
@RobLloyd2 I'd have given it to Cubby myself! Lots of good performances from Scarlets though after a shaky 20 mins spell 1st half.
some great work by Sanjay and Steff Evs before that too.
what a tackle by @cubbyboi to stop that try!! brilliant defence by the Scarlets, keep them out all cost!
@SamProbert79 nah, should be a scrum v i reckon.
aaaaah balls, I think he lost that over the line.
Tyler Morgan easily the stand out for the Dragons today, got bags of talent.
@Tircoeds 10-29 now, and we've a TBP, 12 mins to go :-) all the best for tomorrow btw!
oooff aggressive defence, I love it #scarlets
Brilliant defence again by Steff Evs again.
yes that's the TBP! nice finish by @HarryRobinson25 , nawr te @scarlets_rugby let's really kick on now #ymlaen
Ah now Scarlets that was just stupid, should have gone back the other way.
@Tircoeds given the about of leads we've thrown away this season, I won't expect anything until the FT whistle!
If we could speed up our support at the breakdown, we would improve no end.
@Tircoeds we've just gone into a 24-10 lead, 3 tries to 1 so far.
@Baramenyn I hate you. Put the bloody mockers on us now mun!
@TimAlunWilliams @Coombs_A Tis KenO mun, you'd have needed at least 5 ;-)
Wahey!! what a start to the second half @scarlets_rugby !! Great again from @SanjayWills , bloody love it.
@Coombs_A I'm not surprised! :-) I'm terrified whenever you guys get your hands on the ball, going to be a very nervy 2nd half for me.
@Crys16_Trust slightly better now then they were before - but still not great! long 40 mins to come! #Scarlets #ymlaen
@Coombs_A of course, wider shot shows Clancy not reason tackle not completed. Just don't think line he picked anyone would have stopped him
Perfect time to do it, right at HT, na welliant gan  @scarlets_rugby But please, cut out the basic errors!
BOOM! @SanjayWills and @ScottWilliams_1 at their best. What a couple of minutes for #Scarlets #ymlaen #ymaohyd
@Coombs_A there were two dragons players there to tackle him to mind that didn't.
I think that meant a lot to @kenctsowens ! lovely try by the captain #Scarlets #ymlaen
@HywelV2 :)
@HywelV2 you've not watched us much this season have you? Hadleigh's been a very good signing for us.
Basics Scarlets ffs.
This is exceptionally frustrating. We're making great ground going through the phases but our support play is just far too slow.
Another Cubby special there.
oh give off how the hell is there no camera angle of the push on Harry?!
oh shush Gwyn, priestland's kick to the corner was fine, it was the players covering the quick lineout that weren't.
but seriously, how did we screw up that close to the line? Dragons clearly looking to run it quite literally from everywhere!
what a crazy couple of minutes!
Scarlets looking rather rusty it has to be said. Too many basic errors so far.
Great defensive work from Steff Evs there.
@KirstyRothwell hmm, a possibility. I know I deffo spoke about the film I watched at school and I want to say we saw it on S4C?
well that scrum wasn't too shabby! #scarlets
A day out supporting @scarlets_rugby  or being stuck at home working on an essay? I'm going to be suffering #scarlets withdrawal all day! :(
@DeadpanMarc ah good old Aber. Although to be fair, that's one of the things I don't miss about the place!
@DeadpanMarc haven't you learnt to pre-book tickets by now?!
@davidbogle1 what's this? linkage?
@Cheshireswanny good? that sounds ruddy brilliant! so happy for you :-)
@Crys16_Trust brilliant, diolch.
@Crys16_Trust yep yep will do, where bouts will you guys be, in the barn?
@Crys16_Trust could you put me down for three tickets please?
@CapS45 don't make me feel old mun! Tis more like 15 years....
Enough of politics, time to watch the musical episode of #Buffy, because I'm all super cool like that #BtVS
'You can vote for a coalition of the damned....or you can vote green' what a roundup! #Pippa #Greens #walesdebate
Yes Pippa! right on about our energy! give us the control of our own resources please #Walesdebate
#Labour lack of ambition for Wales is staggering and disgraceful. #walesdebate
@OwainDavies15 @stradeypark well you don't say? Out campaigning for her is he?
@stradeypark @OwainDavies15 the last Plaid leader had the same problem too mind. Actually I think it's something all parties suffer from!
@OwainDavies15 no :( It's one rugby weekend I'm having to forgo,bloody gutted as I do love a trip to Caerdydd. Got a uni deadline coming up.
Really poor performances from both #Labour and #Conservatives tonight on the #walesdebate
@OwainDavies15 I also don't have any issue with Leanne, but then I don't like putting too much down to a leader anyway.
@OwainDavies15 ha see this is how it's interesting how people differ. I find Plaid's message and values clearer now than ever before.
@OwainDavies15 how though? what have they changed/moved away from to undermine that?
@eirianwyn how come? I've always quite liked her, she's doing pretty well tonight too imo
@OwainDavies15 see I'm the opposite. I find them much clearer now, and less a one policy party. They're more credible for me.
@eirianwyn he's doing a bit better than Crabb mind!
When ever Owen Smith speaks all I hear is Roger Speak. It's awful.
@OwainDavies15 do you think? I just think they're growing as a party, they seem to have a lot more substance about them now than in the past
@OwainDavies15 can any party afford to say they won't back it?
why is it that the tweet that gets rt'd the most, is always the one you then notice you've filled with typos? boo.
@OwainDavies15 if Britain wants a referendum they cant say no to it,but it raises a very important question if not all nations want to leave
@HywelV2 ha mine are full of typos and I don't have that excuse!
@HywelV2 really? I think he's been quite good! hardly noticed him which is how I'd prefer it, he is keeping them to time too.
Only pull of of EU if only all 4 countries agree #Yes #SpotOn #PlaidCyrmu #Walesdebate
Sot on there from Leanne too, that's just common sense with regards to free movement within the EU and opportunities for people #walesdebate
@wru4me aye, I used to like Lib Dems but getting in to bed with the Cons has killed them off I fear.
I do like Kirstie Williams, spot on about immigrants there #humanbeingstoo #walesdebate
ha brilliant, Conservatives just owned by UKIP! #walesdebate
Pippa is wonderful. A bit mad, but wonderful #walesdebate
reflect, reflect, reflect....but are you looking forward Owen Smith?
@bethanjenkins I was just wondering that!

Some more than others <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@LeighHalfpenny1 
@robindavey01 @OwenJones84 well, their scaremongering has worked on you then.
@eirianwyn @the_black_otter @HywelV2 now that you mention it....
@the_black_otter @HywelV2 exactly what the physio said! (if you substitute cake for squats :( ) I prefer your remedy :-)
Not great for Dragons that Cudd has had to drop out, been in great form this season.
@HywelV2 dim byd drwg, just dw'i ddim gallu rhedeg. Weak left hip to sort out first according to the physio.
@stephen_ntw nah just do lots of muscle exercises for my hip before I start running again is all.Will know more next week if actual fracture
@taffjames47 nah physio.
So much for my slightly hysterical self diagnosis - turns out I actually might have a stress fracture (that or some technical name thing)

@MikePullen1969 in a nutshell.
@MikePullen1969 but I genuinely worry that it's already too late for my generation, I think it's all been royally messed up for us already.
most depressing thing about #GE2015 ? not one party has any solutions/proposals for people of my generation. In your 20s and 30s? #screwed
Seriously, 80 deliberate grass fires in 48 hours? WTF is wrong with some people in Wales?
@Ceemac6 'Chewie, we're home..' brilliant! Also Chewie hasn't aged AT ALL.
In other news, I've just watched the new teaser #StarWars trailer - excited doesn't cover it!
@alunj92 @OwainDavies15 I don't agree with trident.
@alunj92 that would be one of the not achievable ones. Personally I quite like the greens.
@alunj92 can't agree with that. There are some (not all obvs) policies that the greens have that are fine. Lots not achievable though.
@alunj92 one rather alarming shouty moment, otherwise just about okay.
@HywelV2 mmm, they all had good moments and some not so good. Ed had chances to go for killer shots and didn't quite land them.
@AnkvanPelt Lib Dem's weren't invited I don't think, they weren't absent out of choice.
@HywelV2 hmmm,mixed. Bennet worse,Wood so-so, Sturgeon - good, Farage - idiot but kippers will still vote, Ed - average, needed to be better
@ccurts2 sure we might get more through the mansion tax, but they should point out what we'd be missing out on from the £30billion cuts
@HywelV2 ah I see.
@HywelV2 Dimbleby's was, don't tell me Hague's had fish on too? The sheen on his face distracted me somewhat.
Oh do piss off. opposed to blank cheque spending William? Where's the £8billion extra from NHS coming from then? #BBCDebate
Why have we got Hague to answer all the points afterwards?! They chickened out of the debate,they shouldn't get an unchallenged platform now
@ccurts2 nope they've signed up to the tory cuts, would see our budget cut by 2.2% is what I've been reading!
I've just clocked Dimbleby's tie - brilliant.
European Army? What is Farage on?? #BBCDebate
@HywelV2 well you'd hope, can't believe he's decided to turn against the audience!
oh Farage, what a tit #BBCDebate
So Ed, you won't reverse the commitment of Tory cuts then? answer Leanne's question!

@the_black_otter hahah is that the cause or cure (or both?!). It shall surely do wonders for recovery though :)
@HefinRees1 mmm, that's not quite what I've got I don't think, although internet diagnosis is only useful to scare myself with!
@garethjspencer yeah I've read a couple of your entries, will give it another look. For now I think I'll stick to different stretches!
@garethjspencer apparently there's one in Llanelli!Will have to go next Scarlets home game :) ah wow nice one on the time, great achievment!
@SouthTerracer @Tircoeds aye, will see if there are any physios Carms way :-)
@Tircoeds @SouthTerracer (although further reading would indicate that an anterior shin splint is far more likely!)
@Tircoeds @SouthTerracer it's okay, I've decided to diagnose myself via google, now half convinced I have a stress fracture ;-)
@SouthTerracer it goes away after 4-5 days,comes back whenever do even short run.Only hurts when I run/actually touch the "bruised" area :(
@garethjspencer no where near me does any gait analysis that I know of :( cheers for the advice though! How'd the Paris marathon go??
@SouthTerracer overdo*
@SouthTerracer probs not as much as I should! been making sure not to overdue it with the running as am new to it,but this just gets worse
@SouthTerracer everything I've read about shin splints says it's on the inside not outside of your shin so I don't think it's that
I've been getting some pain on outside of my left shin since I started running, feels like it's bruised, ideas as to cause/cure? #ukrunchat
Can somebody let me know how many points I get here?
@TimLihoreau 
5 and a half hours later on the train and I'm almost home after a brilliant weekend in London #Hapus
@LGBow that looks so good!
@HywelV2 yep, it's gotten a little ignored since the whole 'boo down with Sturgeon' saga.

@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru they are, within the realms of what they can actually *realistically* achieve, they are.
@ccurts2 or keep one of the big parties honest then I'm all for it. It all has to start from somewhere (2/2)
@ccurts2 being realistic they aren't going to get in to power to implement it, but if they can have enough of a voice to force change (1/2)
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I'm not wholly convinced on parts of their manifesto,tis why I'm going to try and go to a meet with my local candidate
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru If I were you, I'd ask to meet with your Plaid candidate so they can try and give you the answers you want :)
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru it's their aim Chris. If they don't tell you their aims, then how are we to learn of their policies?
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru fair enough, I think you're doing Plaid a disservice but hey ho. I'm just sick and tired of Lab/Con/LibDem myself.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I don't think anyone is naiive enough to think that any party can deliver everything they promise Chris.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru at the moment they are no where near to the power to implement ALL. Just look at what they prioritise.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I think it should be read with realism. What they would like to implement and what they CAN if they get any power.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru have you even read their manifesto Chris? Also re-read my tweet, I've said I like policies AND ideals, not either/or.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru that's an oversimplification. Parts of Wales poorest in whole of EU, and we are underfunded, more so than England.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru that's exactly what Plaid want to do,you do get that right? Can't create wealth without more powers though #firststep
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru no party does that.I like Plaid's policies I like their ideals, but I do want to know more about their funding details
@jockulla @ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru It is actually,there's been a few reports in to it. Wales do get raw deal regardless of how much Sco pays in
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru no. Not one party, not even the big parties, get to implement all of their policies.
@ccurts2 @jockulla @Plaid_Cymru ..what their main policies are,ideals &amp;what they will fight to promote, that is the influence they can have
@ccurts2 @jockulla @Plaid_Cymru they aren't going to get enough power to implement all of them though are they? I view it more as (1/2)
@ccurts2 @jockulla @Plaid_Cymru not necessarily, certainly doesn't work that way for Scotland!
@ccurts2 @jockulla @Plaid_Cymru true but we need to get extra powers so we can improve things ourselves. Nothing will change with status quo
Episode 5, season 4 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer - there's a Welsh flag in the background #random
@tisiphone09 @thescarletway haha dim probs :)
@tisiphone09 oh hey it's not by me! can take no credit at all!  it's by the rather good @thescarletway
@ccurts2 ha aye! I'm not sure I understand your political view point at all, but rugby I certainly do :)
Why Choose Rugby? 
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I don't think either are set to get a majority Chris. The more seats smaller parties have, the bigger the influence
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I can't agree with that view point sorry. If we all took that stance then what would be the point of voting at all?
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru the more seats they get the greater influence they have. They're the only party that will fight for it.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru the point they are making is what they would fight for to change Chris.
@ccurts2 @Plaid_Cymru I think 1. better funding for Wales, 2. increases taxes for the rich, they do set it out more in their manifesto.
@haydn_davies @Gofer88 @thescarletway how can we spend the money next season if we don't have it yet?
@tumblescarlet67 @haydn_davies @Gofer88 @martp68 @thescarletway they also own the hospitality area, can make a ton of £££ from Swansea's use
@haydn_davies @Gofer88 @thescarletway no thanks. I want a sustainable future for my club. Why spend money we won't have for another few yrs?
wow, Kristoff! how composed was he at the end? brilliant for a breakaway rider to win it with even a mini sprint at the end. #rvv2015

@SouthTerracer I met him at the Pro12 launch up in Glasgow a couple seasons back now when he was still coaching Ulster.
@davidbogle1 I hadn't actually! Now that it is interesting, that's Farage's area isn't it?
Can't believe a cyclist got taken out by a support car! #TourOfFlanders

@Rhino_Phillips indeed. audience and jonathan dimbleby didn't much like his answer!
@Rhino_Phillips pretty much! asked why 40% quit after one year, he rambled on about how strong the economy is and a competitive job industry
Yes really Francis,teachers are dropping out after 1 yr teaching because the economy is strong and there are jobs elsewhere #idiot #bbcr4aq
No Conservative is able to actually rule out a potential deal with UKIP. That should be reason enough to not vote for them.


@tumblescarlet67 has there really been that much?I've hardly seen any at all, and most of the stuff I've been reading has actually been +ive
@The_T_Andrews they wanted to be if I recall! I think the NI parties are having their own specialised TV debate now though instead.
@The_T_Andrews because the debate was broadcast to the whole of Britain? Or shouldn't Welsh and Scottish people see all their choices?
@JonathanPlaid will do, diolch.
@JonathanPlaid diolch am ateb. I was just wondering if there will be an open meeting in the area at all?
@JonathanPlaid @Plaid_Cymru Any chance of a reply? I live local to the area and would have liked to hear the views put forward for Plaid.
@Chevans93  that poll had more than just a simple choice of independence or not. Why not find the figure for those that want more powers?
@ccurts2 That said I don't think Labour have done very well here either, some standards at certain age brackets is v worrying.
@ccurts2 nah not in Wales, across the border, got a few teacher friends over there and it's awful. Much worse than here.
@Scarlet_rob his comments on AIDS should be the tipping point,but fear it might not be.Farage is a v good speaker, regardless of his message
@Scarlet_rob he was abhorrent tonight, it really is quite frightening that so many people seem to be buying in to the UKIP ideology.
@Scarlet_rob none of the polls make much sense to me!
@Sonjamclaughlan Plaid have a very difficult battle, so many areas have overwhelming Labour majorities, very hard to overcome.
@stradeypark @OwainDavies15 fair enough! :-)
@Squidgysue @LeanneWood definitely, great for us to have a voice on a British scale for a change speaking up for Wales #leadersdebate
Oh god, that poor person in the audience, imagine how sweaty Ed's hands must be! #leadersdebate
@OwainDavies15 aye that it is.
@OwainDavies15 I do like Adam, was brilliant when he was MP back here. I just really like the messages Plaid are sending out.
@Squidgysue it's just such a refreshing change over the boring same old same old spiel! #leadersdebate
@stradeypark @OwainDavies15 it is her or Plaid you have an issue with?
@OwainDavies15 @stradeypark She's really targeting key issues well. Very pleasantly surprised.
@OwainDavies15 @stradeypark I haven't agreed with Plaids tactics in the past but I've been really pleasantly surprised recently.
@OwainDavies15 @stradeypark if you look at the leaders debate hashtag, most think she's doing brilliantly.
@eirianwyn she stood up and was shouting down questions at cameron!!
ohho! someone's woken up the audience!
@gwladrugby no that was the chair, housing was the 2nd part of the question mun!
Leanne pointing out the cuts both Labour AND Tories would make on Wales' education budget if they get voted in #Leadersdebate
@Squidgysue I think she's been brilliant, out and out best speaker there tonight, she's cut down Clegg, Cameron and Farage. Love it.
This #ConDem government has destroyed a lot of what was good about the education system. Ask teachers. Impossible working environments.
@4rickus4 @Tircoeds @Plaid_Cymru maybe not, but I don't believe Labour deserve another chance, not with their record here in Wales.
Piss off on the pensions cameron, I don't believe a word! No one really answering the Q either to how to improve things for my generation
@4rickus4 @Tircoeds @Plaid_Cymru Id agree with that if Wales was getting an equal deal but we don't.Someone needs to stand up for our rights
@bloodandmud @gwladrugby @Tircoeds @Plaid_Cymru aye it's either that, or people would vote Labour even if a turkey was standing.
Brilliant question! they better give bloody good answer!
@4rickus4 @Tircoeds @Plaid_Cymru ha maybe, at least we know she's guaranteed to put Wales first though, which I do like.
Miliband and Cameron have now both avoided the pertinent questions put to them by both Wood and Sturgeon #leadersdebate
@Tircoeds @Plaid_Cymru Leanne is playing her cards very well, I've got to admit, but then I suppose I'm pro Plaid anyway :-)
@brianmoore666 he is a v, v canny and natural speaker, which makes his doubly dangerous when you consider the vile rhetoric he's spouting
@brianmoore666 Farage made too big an error with his comments on AIDS to be honest. Way down in my view. Sturgeon, Wood &amp; Clegg doing well
@LeftUnityUK i think #LeanneWood just said all that for you.
'Have you seen what Labour is doing in Wales?' re NHS. Exactly! Labour's record is as bad as the ConDem in England #leadersdebate

Leanne ONLY leader to get a round of applause! 

#Llanelli
First round of applause goes to Leanne Wood! #leadersdebate Farage really is despicable.
Boom! Sturgeon that was brilliant on Farage!! #leadersdebate
Chair is really not doing a great job.
Oi, Ed, you haven't answered Leanne's question that Labour has failed in Wales #leadersdebate
@robindavey01 why the need for dear on the end of that? patronising much?
Wood, Bennett and Sturgeon all nailing it on the deficit #leadersdebate
@MikePullen1969 aaaah okay.
why've they skipped to David? have I missed Ed and Leanne??
Cameron looks like he's bricking it.
I'm rather overexcited for the #leadersdebate, it's the perfect buildup for what will be an ultimate disappointment #BritishPolitics
@mickado15 ah okay that sounds pretty good, shall have to add it to my list of awesome shows to watch :-)
@mickado15 what is this show? I've seen loads about it the last couple of days.
@rava_ian cheers bud.

@rava_ian @mickthompson83 doubt it given inconsistencies in citings across different leagues,think there's a huge problem across the board
@mickthompson83 @rava_ian yeah I know, but then I didn't agree with the decision not to cite him when he clearly should have been...
@mickthompson83 @rava_ian @simonrug Ha! :-) He's a marked card for me now Mick He targeted a player's exposed neck and head no place for it.
@rava_ian @simonrug I think he's a thug who has now intentionally injured 2 players and shouldn't be near a rugby pitch.
@rugbyPhilBB don't forget the game against Scarlets when they should have 2 red cards but didn't...
@rava_ian @simonrug haha well I clearly thought he should have been, I've changed history :-) seriously though he's had recent form for it.
@simonrug halved for what do we know? he was cited just a few weeks ago for another incident that's injured a player for at least 6 weeks!

The word "Valleys" isn't even mentioned on p49. Care to retract your statem…
@gwladrugby @WelshLabPress @welshlabour @NThomasSymonds good luck getting a reply, they seem to go quiet when you point out facts.
@Gofer88 mm, tis a tricky one. I guess it's to deter late challenges after a player has scored, that goes unpunished too often sometimes
@Gofer88 am guessing it's due to recklessness over anything like intent?
@WelshLabPress @gwladrugby @welshlabour @NThomasSymonds if so why do you assume that specifically references the Valleys?
@WelshLabPress @gwladrugby @welshlabour @NThomasSymonds they'll 'change the public funding formula such as local government' bit you mean?
@WelshLabPress @gwladrugby @welshlabour @NThomasSymonds it doesn't, even the quote you put in your article doesn't mention a cut to valleys

I think I wrote to many words this evening, my brain actually hurts #creativewriting

@MTAG09 @scarlets_rugby so glad you're back home and resting up.
@TheXVIthWarrior not for long! Ospreys will go back ahead of Leinster in about 9 mins.
That was a cracking run in by Baker.
Have you turned yours off? #LightsOutCymru #EarthHourUK
@DeadpanMarc ha it looks like a lot of fun! you all recovered?
@nickwebb2017 @gerz1987 yep, we haven't played that badly at home in a LONG time. Picked up injuries too. Really not a great day.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac: "We were outpassioned on our own piece of dirt"  
@GarethBale11 buddugoliaeth gwych! excellent result #Wales
@nickwebb2017 a very, very slender thread. Play again like we did today and I can't see how we deserve it to be honest.
I would love to see a really high quality closely fought match which ultimately ends in a 0-0 draw later #BELvCYP
Da iawn @FAWales , brilliant performance away from home, puts us in a great position now. #TopOfTheGroup #Cymru
@rava_ian ha you know I really would actually watch that,you'd need some sort of superb commentary team for it though to keep it interesting
Bale!!!! excellent performance so far from Wales, playing so well. Just put us into a 3-0 lead....
@cphilpott95 haha fair enough. I never really understood that one anyway. Raised in Anglesey and a fluent Welsh speaker :-)
@cphilpott95 ???
@danthedealer @dragonsrugby haha! all the best to you but it's not likely to make me much happier!
@cphilpott95 our football team's always had one of them! Just nice we've got more than 1 truly great player now :-) #Bale #Ramsey
It's as though I'm in an alternate universe where Welsh football must cheer me up as my rugby team has failed.
@Carmjournal psst, I think you mean Parc y Scarlets.
@scarlets_rugby @MTAG09 thanks for the update, fingers crossed he's okay.
Don't think the red card affected the result though, we just didn't turn up.
Moment of madness from cawdor, you can't use your head, even if his attempt was "mild".
Really disappointing performance, completely out played, think we can say bye to top 6. Only positives were cubby and Ken.
@HywelV2 worst I've seen us play at home for nearly 2 years. Outplayed across the parc (bar cubby)
Our lineout is in all sorts of trouble, if we don't sorted it could be a long 2nd half.
@SamProbert79 @spectator pretty bloody frightening isn't it?
@TonduTurk @RobLloyd2 oh no way :-(

@timoconnorbl @ScotRugbyBlog ah cheers,I knew there'd been loads of tries, Perp ended up with both a LBP and TBP in that game!
@CapS45 ah okay, yn meddwl am eiliad bod S4C yn dangos gyd o Tan ar y comin, o'n in mynd i cael horrible flashbacks o gwersi Cymraeg!
@CapS45 beth yw hwn?
@ccurts2 this is my favourite tweet of the night :)
@DickieCloggs well, neutral ones would be a start!
@timoconnorbl @ScotRugbyBlog I think something similar happened in a Scarlets v Perpignion game a few seasons ago, would need to check tho!
@tumblescarlet67 they are a very difficult team to like, their dirty play also really doesn't help.
@tumblescarlet67 not scoring before half time was the killer, just too much to claw back and always susceptible to getting hit on the break.
Ulster look seriously unfit.
@rugbyPhilBB not really, he's still letting Ulster get away with a lot but he's putting in a decent performance.
Yes! na welliant Caerdydd, lovely passage of play!
Okay, Glasgow, did you even come back out on to the pitch 2nd half?!
Really nice to see Henry making a comeback after such a serious health scare in November.
What a run!! Da iawn Caerdydd! Deserved try for all your effort, lovely lovely run by the winger.
They've got to have another yellow, Ulster just repeatedly infringing for fun.
@rava_ian hahahaha!
@Gofer88 well yes, there's that too.
@Gofer88 he needs to just knuckle down and get himself back into form, his confidence is all over the shop.
@Gofer88 He may have even made it himself, but you don't panic pass like that so close to the line!
They've turned down a potential 12 points at goal too, really not their best half of rugby.
Oh ffs Cuthbert, basics mun!  Cardiff deserved points from there.
My ears must surely be deceiving me, I mean Irish fans NEVER boo an official, right?!
@theblitzdefence oof shit. That's really not good.
@theblitzdefence really not good, he gets knocked out far too much. How'd it happen?
Got to be a yellow. Well done Mitrea.
@theblitzdefence Im listening to Welsh commentary,it's got a pretty clear ref mic feed. TMO definitely adised he wanted to look at something
@theblitzdefence I think the TMO contacted him first about it?
@Smallclone he didn't, the TMO's contacted him to advise him off something so he has to listen I think.
hasn't he barged Cuthbert off the ball first?
@BarrieJones @PRO12rugby I think a lot of it is £££ they don't want to pay to fly out neutral teams of officials.
@StuDavies They've always got to be so careful when it's neck/head/shoulder, you just don't know. Really hope it was all precautionary.
@ccurts2 @rugbyPhilBB @WelshDalaiLama @BBCScrumV yep if he had to ask what part of arm used then he can't have been able to see it himself
@TimAlunWilliams I'm raging, absolutely raging. He's a type of player that has NO place in rugby.
@ccurts2 he was yeah.
So yet another game when Ulster should be a man down but aren't due to failures from an Irish TMO. @PRO12rugby You've got to sort this.
@WelshDalaiLama @BBCScrumV to be fair to him, he asked the advice of the TMO. I'd say his Irish colleague let him down.
He struck a players neck and head, and followed through with his elbow. And only a yellow on advice of Irish TMO. Farcical.
This is a player that should have been banned for putting Shingler out for weeks, now looks to have done Patchell serious damage.
used his shoulder upper arm?! wtf is this TMO on?! how the hell can you recommend YELLOW?!
@GazNoTan like a stiff swinging arm direct into Patchell's neck/head when he joined the ruck.
Swinging arm into his neck/head.
Nick Williams. AGAIN. He should have been banned for what he did to Shingler, and now he's injured Patchell. Disgusting player.
Not great injury wise for either side not even 5, but that really doesn't look good for Olding.

@IrvineWelsh I'd say that's a pretty spot on verdict.
@alunj92 the audience were really poor I thought, not sure if you've gotten to that part yet!
There is an idiot woman on Newsnight, talk about taking answers out of context to twist to your own ends, then again that sums up #politics
@alunj92 he gave such soft answers, but then again the questions were hardly challenging for him, he could avoid most of them easily.
@HywelV2 plus I think today's were clearly hand picked too.
@HywelV2 the religious guy in Scotland during the independence debate can't have been hand picked! it was brilliant.
@HywelV2 the audience were pretty rubbish to be fair, give me a question time audience any day!
@HywelV2 no but they did ask if Balls understood  the need about regulating the banks!
@HywelV2 he actually did well, think maybe too well as Paxo and Burley ended up chucking in snide comments about his brother.
Why are they making such a stink about David Miliband? that's not relevant at all to the GE #BattleForNumber10
@HywelV2 Basically they're both pretty rubbish but at least Miliband has pretended to care about making a fairer society.
@HywelV2 nope, I am persevering, to see if I can actually pick out any points from all the cliches.
'right' 'let me explain' I hate political speak. I really do.
Well Miliband did a lot better than Cameron there #BattleForNumber10
Kay is SO a Conservative. She smarmd all over Cameron, doesn't appear to like Milliband much! #BattleForNumber10
Well, he's right about living standards anyway #BattleForNumber10
@MikePullen1969 I'm going to have to watch it on catch up, I guess the audience must have felt sorry for him!
What rubbish studio audience was that?! talk about giving him an easy ride #BattleForNumber10
@MikePullen1969 I missed the first part! Can't tell if I should be glad or not...
Yes or No David, yes or no!
@Cheshireswanny @the_black_otter ooo I like this! look forward to reading more :)

@garethjspencer dim probs! i'd been meaning to do it for yonks!
@iwanthomas4 it's been pwp for a while anyway!
@Baramenyn I genuinely thought you'd just made that up. Then I saw the article on the Beeb....
@scarlets_rugby @Will_Tayls91 croeso i'r Scarlets!
Have you got your ticket? 
@EnfysJones1 how was it out there then? weather looked amazing! And I could watch that Scott Williams try on a loop :-)
@EnfysJones1 @scarlets_rugby ha and Rome didn't?! you got to see one of the best tries made by all Scarlets players - live!
@DeadpanMarc yeah it's so so weird watching them all back, the links are all there even from season 1. I'd forgotten how good it is!
Bloody hell, even  #TheFirst gets a mention in season 3! all part of the overall plan....
I completely forgot that Anya appeared to early as season 3 in #Buffy ! #BtVS awesome episode #IWish
@scarlets_rugby haha fair enough!
@scarlets_rugby can we have a clue??
FOOD FOR THOUGHT... 
@Cheshireswanny amazing!! well done lovely! I'd say that calls for a celebratory few pints.... :-)
@scarlets_rugby @Revsprop1 brilliant new! hapus iawn with that, a top player! #scarlets #ymaohyd
Why settle for 3,000 words when you can write 4,000? smashed my target! #Productive #CreativeWriting
Avoiding course work today, going to focus on my own stuff instead. 3,000 words, can I do it? #challenge #creativewriting
This 6 Nations short list is alphabetical, so why is Alun-Wyn Jones between Vunipola and Youngs??
@RobLloyd2 @sport_swep great news :-)
#AsExpected 
Too much #FoodForThought ?
Don't you love it when you've been living like a hermit to save money &amp; 3 days before pay day your car breaks? No? me neither! #annoyed
@scarlets_rugby I can get up to four with mine if anyone needs the tickets for a £5, let me know!
@garethjspencer diolch! will keep trying anyway :-)
@garethjspencer no long term goal at the moment, would just be pleased if I can get good enough to attempt a 5k park run!
@garethjspencer easy?! pah! You are tweeting that to someone who still struggles with a 20 min run! :-)
@garethjspencer that looks more like torture to me!
Submitted my assignment and just seen the footy score. What a wonderful day!
easements, restrictive and positive covenants. I don't like you :(
@OwainDavies15 I've no doubt he'll put my knowledge to shame ha!
@haydn_davies Ken, to Cawdor, to Rhys, to Foxy, to Cawdor, to Scott = bloody beautiful!
@OwainDavies15 hahaha true! Culwch and Olwen IS good, even if he does get Arthur to do everything for him!
@OwainDavies15 I did a load on it last year, so don't mind it myself! Branwen ferch Llyr is my favourite but I'm a bit of literary nerd :-)
@OwainDavies15 yep, tis the last module of my 2nd year of my MA. Got a load of reading to do for it, need the books first mind...
I now have the joy of a trip to Lampeter tomorrow then #YMabinogi #PedairCainc #MA
Was going to pick up books from uni library next week for my last essay, just checked dates, closed 28/03 - 19/04!! thank god I checked!!

And it's my BIRTHDAY!! <BEER MUG><BEER MUG> 

Celebrations now sta…
@rava_ian @mickthompson83 @mickado15 @ShellyannCooke ha ta! twas a long shot for Wales but my dad's not at his happiest!
@CharlieFelix something should be done but needs to be thought over carefully eg. Slam situation. Today was something else though!
Ah that's nice for the Irish players that the crowd could stay in Murrayfield for this.
@mickthompson83 @mickado15 @rava_ian @ShellyannCooke congrats! hope you're all still breathing!
10 points between the top 3 sides says it all #SoClose
Well done #Ireland on getting the trophy! What a last day, the Top 3 all so close to each other #6Nations
What a crazy manic day,those England players will be gutted,that was by far the best match of the day. Credit to both teams #England #France
France what are you doing?!
@DeadpanMarc haha I thought it was something like that! maybe not quite a serious injury that then...
@DeadpanMarc paper cut?
@HywelV2 @rava_ian yep, 6 points to get! my dad has turned to the red wine....
@HywelV2 @rava_ian best match of the day!! 55-35 to England, 5 mins to go!
@haydn_davies well there's 1!!!
@mickado15 epic day of rugby. 7 mins my friend, 7 mins....
hahaha my Dad's nerves are shot
Do France have a worse kick at goal record than Italy this year?
A thing of beauty #FrenchPack
Nige is starting to annoy me with his breakdown calls. Tom Youngs was off his feet and in from the side there in that ruck.
what a support run from a prop!! amazing France!
@LleuW it's amazing!
@mickthompson83 a trip is a trip, got to go!
Haskell tripped my beautiful #Plisson!
This is one of the craziest days of watching rugby I can remember. 3 proper mental matches #Tries #6Nations
@LleuW hahah I can't believe there is a book like that in existence.
Nige is not having his best day of reffing the breakdown today, but what a hotly contested match, both teams giving it everything.
And then they do that....bloody hell France, I think you're trying to give the whole of Ireland a heart attack.
What an offload by the French hooker! Tidy try, perfect start to the 2nd half for France! #Plisson
@markdav42 I think he'd have given it to France if their own players hadn't gone straight off their feet.
Good try, that was a lovely break by Youngs...oh wait no, knock on? or is that  a French hand?
nah that's handbags.
I think that's a late hit. It's marginal but I think it's late. He's led with the shoulder too. Ouch. My poor #Plisson
France, oh joyous France how I have missed you! why don't they play like this all of the time?
Naikaitaci......what a way to almost mess that up!
@mickthompson83 don't need that.
either way, that's incredibly stupid from that French man.
plus ball is down before his foot touches.
nah that's a try, doesn't matter if his foot is out, the ball is still in.
hhahaha I think he's gone out!
beautiful!!! I changed allegiance just in time!
Actually stuff it, I fancy Plisson #AllezLesBleus #Fickle
@mickado15 I have a feeling your tweets may mirror mine from the last match, just substitute France for Scotland, expect plenty of FFS's
Lovely try that! the buggers. They have played nice rugby all tournament mind. Shocker of a pass in midfield by France.
aaah Castaignede, I wish France still had players like him. Righty, now Wales are out of it hoping I can enjoy this match.
@SteveinSenni France have betrayed us by being utter pwp in recent years?
Basically I think I'm going to be happy either way, so here's hoping it's as an exciting a match as the others have been today! #6Nations
So France playing lovely rugby= I love French rugby = me happy. England playing well enough to win = dad happy = someone at home happy.
ah Thierry, I just don't think I can't not support you. Hmmmmm if France play like they can my love of French rugby may just reassert itself
@mickthompson83 I dont like Irish tactics at the breakdown&amp;I hate how they scream at the referee,it makes them v difficult to enjoy watching
@mickthompson83 I find Wales' tactics usually v boring, say it all the time but they're my country, can't not support them!
@mickthompson83 hate?nah just don't like how Ireland play rugby&amp;as said in another tweet,my dad's English, be nice for sum1 @ home to win 6N
@stradeypark yeah, I realised my error after I pressed tweet!
Oh really, how Garces reffed the ruck suited Ireland? hahahahah #Wood #Shameless
@bencoles_ oh I dunno, Italy still managed to be competitive for one half.
@phog6189 1. my dad is English so one of my family needs to be happy today! 2. I prefer England's style of rugby to Ireland's.
Ignore that last tweet, forgot France only on 4. England to...oh god...win then. I feel unclean.
Is there any mathematical chance for France to win? If not I'm going to have to support England and that never sits well with me.
@mickthompson83 welcome to my world!
@HarpinOnRugby the rest was fine, not so the grounding!
Oh my titting god, he's dropped it over the line.
Oh my fucking Christ. Well, that's 1 try down! Or is it? c'mon TMO...
2 tries in 5 minutes. C'mon Scotland, you've simply been lulling us ....
My dream of a last 10 mins Scotland intercept try to win it is gone then. Bugger.
@JohnKav1 I'm on about the screaming at the ref.
POC shouts maul and thus it was so. C'mon Garces ref it for yourself.
idiot grubber kick.
@rava_ian nah look he's fooled us both! The bugger ;-)
oh....piss.
Sexton is just missing these kicks to give Wales fans false hope isn't he?
@Ms_JulieJ although now I think about it, I think I might prefer your word.
@Ms_JulieJ proactively?
why box kick out of your 22, why not clear it to touch further down?
yes! we're still ahead by 1!
now that really should be at least a warning if not, that was soooo stupid from Scotland.
Now that was an equal challenge in the air.
Gaaaah that was a good try. Merde (getting my French in early)
@rava_ian @mickthompson83 I've been outside with the dog! Only been half watching the 2nd half.
@rava_ian that's the thing, under the laws it's technically not wrong.
@mickthompson83 @rava_ian was someone taken out in the air? that's what Ian and I were just discussing. Apologies if so, I've missed that.
@rava_ian yelled? ha yellowed even. All I ask for is consistency in refereeing decisions across the board.
@rava_ian tell that to the ref who yelled Foxy up in Murrayfield.
Ireland don't like passing more than twice do they?
Brilliant by Bennett.
@mickthompson83 you not seen all the other yellow cards for contact in the air this tournament? #consistency
Just been outside for my HT vitamin D, it really is glorious outside.
Payne not getting that deserved yellow could be a decider. Wonder if we'll hear Irish fans moaning about the officials this week....
@RichardHThomas1 see my follow up tweet!
Which is unfortunate as he's running some lovely lines.
Scottish 12 cannot offload, that's three times he's failed at it.
Hogg you would have been offside anyway.
I do like Bennett.
Cross not binding properly at all there.
@nickwebb2017 ouch the poor sod. Was such a brave attempt to tackle Roberts, shows the force in rugby these days.
I take it ALL back Scotland. That was so much better!! #YrAlban #Scotland #Hope
@rava_ian whinging at referees ;-)
@cphilpott95 Italy were good for the 1st half at least! and most our tries came when they were down to 14!
Oh ffs. Gees Scotland, hand them it gift wrapped why don't you :-(
I do like Fitzgerald mind, nice to see him back after a dreadful run of injuries.
@BenJeffreys yup, you look at what Foxy got yellowed for up in Murrayfield then Payne should have been nailed on yellow.
Why spend 5 seconds telling green to leave it ?if they aren't leaving it, you ping them.
He's pulled him over there, that should have been a yellow if we're going by the other decisions in this tournament. Ireland very lucky.
That was better from Yr Alban. Wouldn't mind if you take the 3 now....
@kevlar56rts did better than any other side v Italy this year. With some really, really lovely tries.
At least Italy put up a fight for the 1st half. C'mon Scotland ffs. Ooh beard!
Oh c'mon Garces grow a backbone....Good!
I feel sick. This is going to be such a stressful day of watching rugby after Wales' brilliance earlier.
What the hell were the Scottish defenders doing then? they just watched O'Connell go over.
@HywelV2 not a bad 2nd half, was it? :D
urgh Philip Matthews. Just...just urgh.
C'mon Scotland, you know you don't want to get the spoon!
@mickthompson83 you should be taking back your nasty words about Italy!
Suppose we really couldn't have done more.England need 17,Ireland need 21 I take it.I will now be Scottish or French for the rest of the day
@cphilpott95 I have blanked all rugby from 2007 from my mind for some reason.
See so we can play running rugby when it matters, wish we'd bloody do it more often! #Cymru
That really could cost us the title, man alive. This is going to be a nerve wracking day. #SuperSaturday
@mickado15 tis a try. Boo!!
@mickthompson83 hahahah!
Shit. That was too easy, bugger bugger bugger we couldn't afford to concede any more! praying that doesn't cost us!
@mickthompson83 Theyve beaten everyone bar England haven't they?They're more competitive than they used to be.Relegation would set them back
@mickthompson83 2nd half they've fallen apart a bit but I don't think you're giving Wales enough credit either.
@mickthompson83 they don't have the squad depth for a whole tournament but you cannot argue that they've gotten a lot better.
KenO! #Sheriff on the rampage!
@mickthompson83 6 day turnaround was always going to affect their 2nd half too, and their pack replacements aren't the best.
@mickthompson83 they gave your boys a really good game, put the frightners on England and beat Scotland. Not good last week.
now THAT was a try made in West Wales #Scarlets #OnceAScarlet #Cymru what an effort from the team, never seen them like this before.
@DeadpanMarc hahahaha! told you!
@DeadpanMarc why not? he's a tidy full back and Sanjay's been carrying a knock all 2nd half.
Priestland to fullback then. What a game from Sanjay
We cannot concede any more points. Cannot.
YES! YES! YES!! doing EVERYTHING we can! what a try, Scott, Tips a y Capten! #Cymru
@OwainDavies15 nah their forward replacements are just pwp, soon as they lose the set piece = shit.
Bugger, we've missed 4 points with the boot today, could be crucial.
Da iawn Rhys Webb! strength to get over there, and boy did we need that try!
I would say that was held up.
Must stop feeling sorry for Italy, I must stop feeling sorry for Italy. Let's be ruthless! Less aimless kicking too please bechgyn.
@BarrieJones hahaha true!
Only 8 points ahead of Ireland now, we need more, only 4 ahead of Lloegr. Still need a couple of tries if poss.
KenO fired up, everything starting to click, make that a 3rd for Georgie! #ArDan #Cymru
@gwladrugby he's already on!
making the extra man count straight away! 2nd try Georgie! #GameOn #Cymru
@thepaulwilliams nice to see him in a Welsh shirt in his proper position, shame for 1/2p though, didn't look good leaving the pitch.
What a 5 mins by @SanjayWills!! set that right up for @George_North ! #Cymru #Ymlaen
nice line @SanjayWills! That try was coming #Cymru
@MikePullen1969 depends what the ref has asked them to keep a look out for I guess.
This is the most beautiful Saturday we've had in months, I almost wish to curse you super saturday!
@the_black_otter ha nah, I can just read a course manual!
Also, Castro is a cunning old prop but surely the ref/AR should be spotting the illegal bind every time?
@JohnKav1 mmm yeah. Biggar's a v good place kicker though and Sanjay's main trade is as a full back so not too bad, 1/2p diff league though
1/2p is a lot like Sexton, really good player but really doesn't have a very good tackling technique. Hope he's okay.
I just don't understand what's gone wrong over the last 40 minutes... I just can't get this blasted icing right for my cupcakes :(
@theblitzdefence @Rhino_Phillips yep, mind you money is not the same as in football so maybe it is proportionate.  I dunno.
@theblitzdefence not sure if that's enough to send out a strong enough message. His comments were completely disgraceful.
I feel a bit gutted for Italy there actually. Really ground that out but well done none the less #Wales #U20s
@Cheshireswanny cheers! doesn't go towards anything but at least I know I've got the answer technique right, just need to memorise it now(!)
The 2015 6 Nations - It's Grim Up North 
@gwladrugby Gareth Llewellyn?? (tis him or Daf James, I can't quite place the voice)
@DeadpanMarc well he did build his own shed out of wood, clearly he must have had carpentry influence in his life,you may be on to something
@DeadpanMarc well they either do or my dad is a magician, because we definitely eat them all year around!
@DeadpanMarc why don't you just shop in Sainsbury's? or would that make them Jesus? hot cross buns are always there!
@cridlyn you were saying? :)
93% in my first land law study exercise, have a feeling things will get far trickier when it's a closed book exam though!
The biggest question about the solar eclipse: how the heck do SO many people own welding masks?!
@Riscatrig devastated! we shall never see his wondrous and beautiful bearded face grace a rugby field again :(
@Caryl_Elin got the thank you postcard, cracking picture!! glad you guys raised so much :)
It gets to something when I actually WANT to go for a run but can't because of my stupid knee.
@thepaulwilliams it'll depend on the referee.
Welsh people have the most British DNA apparently. Well, duh. History tells you they're the oldest Britains.
@SouthTerracer plus, under the original use of the word Celt,no British or Irish peoples would apply anyway.
@SouthTerracer I did an essay a couple months ago on the origins of the Celts, no clear evidence at all, it's just far too general a term.
Also 'Celtic' only came into popular use in the 18th century and that was due to the linguistic groups that linked up with Gaul.
Another thing, the Greek and Romans NEVER referred to the people of Britain and Ireland as Celtic in any of the evidence available.
Considering Celts were the name of ONE tribe in Gaul named by the Greeks and Romans of course they aren't going to be a unique genetic group
@Tircoeds please tell me they haven't! they can't have....have they?
@thepaulwilliams I'm quite surprised the WRU can afford so many so soon given the WRU said so often they didn't have anymore money.
The moment you realise you've just manage to spill some orange coloured soup on to your cream coloured jumper #Fail
@alastaireykyn what, an unfit prop who's decided to retire himself in a world cup year?
@stradeypark @vaughany9 exactly, he's come through our academy, he's one of our stars, ppl should want regions AND national side to succeed
Samson being out to potentially beyond the world cup is an absolutely huge blow for #Scarlets too, he's such a key part of our squad.
@OwainJTJones It just makes Adam's decision all the stranger. Why retire in a world cup year when there's always chance of injuries?
@simonrug @OwainJTJones bugger :( that's rubbish from both a Wales and Scarlets pov, but most of all for him.
Am I the only one who wouldn't ask Adam Jones to un-retire himself? Just can't see he's got the required fitness anymore.
@CharlieFelix @thepaulwilliams he also said to SOB to keep his hands off the floor when SOB was whinging about not being awarded a pen
Radwanska nets it! #HeatherWatson gets her best EVER win, amazing! Beat her in straight sets too! 6-4 6-4, fabulous!
3 match points!
@SiobhanCorc chance* bugger, I hate typos.
Heather #Watson serving for the match v Radwanska, this could be her first ever top 10 win. Huge change for her! #Tennis
@the_black_otter @eirianwyn I did wonder why it was so familiar looking.... :)
@Jamiehuwroberts the team defensive effort was something else, fully deserved that roar!
@eirianwyn @the_black_otter the eyes too! and usually the teeth....
Very glad I switched over to the U18s match instead of trying to persevere with Ita v Fra. Cracking win over England for the boys!
@eirianwyn @the_black_otter haha maybe not! monkeys actually kind of creep me out a little bit :-/
Is the French scrum half called Cheeseboard as I would swear that's what Eddie Butler is saying #ItavFra
naaaaaah how unlucky! out off the post.
@Rhino_Phillips does he ever kick at goal? I think he's their very last option, but cant see Allen lasting if he tries to take another one.
Italy's only kicker going into this game with a groin injury, really not great for them trying to pick up points from deserved penalties.
Thierry Dusautoir is still one of my favourite, favourite players. #ItavFra
Six Nations 2015: Wales coach Warren Gatland ensures Ireland's Johnny Sexton is beaten at his own game @Telegraph 
@GazNoTan awful wasn't it? he's one of the Irish players I actually like so twas v disappointing to hear it.
@Tayles1985 @WRUWomenSupport @IrishRugby here's hoping! The Irish side is pretty darn good though, will be a bruising encounter!
@eirianwyn @Carmjournal clearly not! disgusting it;s been targeted so many times too. Really can't understand some people.
@sheep_and_rugby @tisiphone09 @WelshRugbyUnion urgh. where's the mute button...
@sheep_and_rugby @tisiphone09 @WelshRugbyUnion I actually happen to agree with her a bit, and absolutely no need for your type of comment.
@GazNoTan Or did you mean why were there scrums in the first place? (if so not sure, I wasn't focusing on that!)
@GazNoTan last 2 scrums, 75th min went against us for crooked feed. Lino called the decision for last scrum, think was for offside.
@GazNoTan I'll let you know in a minute, just 10 mins left of this replay!
@GazNoTan nope, he was very very good. Really clear, consistent to both sides, no major howlers. Can't see what's to criticise.
@Steffan_Thomas1 aye lots think that, depending on Jamie's injury might leave Gats with no choice mind.
62nd minute - cais. This is so much nicer watching it 2nd time around when my nerves aren't shot.
60th minute enter Scott :)
Gah butchered that chance 59th minute.
defence from 49mins to 54mins, bloody excellent.
@GazNoTan kept his discipline too, he's made such a big improvement since the start of the season.
@GazNoTan yeah the scrum could have been a real weapon for us. Would have loved to have seen Samson and Rob on together too.
Jamie, one arm injured, tackles Payne so hard he takes out Zebo too. Missed that first time around!
50th minute stinger for Dan Bigger.
@GazNoTan ha yep, don't say we will actually have to praise Gats? I think all the subs were on time (bar Lyds - penalty too late!)
@Riscatrig yeah I noticed that, players really played themselves to a stand still some of them.
@GazNoTan yep he put in a series of really really important tackles after those two hits. Amazing.
@Riscatrig wow hadn't realised that! makes his half of rugby even more impressive!
Jamie hurt his arm 43rd minute tackling Henshaw.
@minded1984 @BenJeffreys nah it got pulled down (there was a welsh player right on the floor), they'd have scored if not for that.
@BenJeffreys I'm watching it again now, he just communicated so well with the players too. Really impressed with him and no major blunders.
@Squidgysue ooo yes, I like your thinking!
@Squidgysue @ScottWilliams_1 Jamie was amaaaazing defensively, but Scott was superb when he came on too. Tough call!
Ahhh twas Henshaw not Murray with the knee on Webb, more accidental than anything.
Fantastic under the high ball first half, Sanjay's take v Bowe is a thing of beauty.
I missed this earlier in the match but it's time to now ask the really serious questions. Has Heaslip had a perm?
Bloody hell hadn't realised how early on Gethin started to get treatment on his leg either - 12 mins in!
In case anyone is interested, repeat of Wales game being shown in full now on @S4C
@RickOSheaRugby *cough* Wales women *cough*
@Riscatrig @ultimaterugby @hallam_amos hahaha it was remarkably similar! Foxy didn't quite master the 'sit down' part of it though...

@ultimaterugby @haydn_davies ha you can also hear Barnes telling the Irish players to be quiet! #loveit
@BenJeffreys yeah all good with me! enjoying my international rugby again :) hope all's well with you? (and Pontypool!)
pob lwc am 'fori @Caryl_Elin massive game for the team!
@BenJeffreys really, really good so many players putting their body on the line, really fantastic effort.
@BenJeffreys  and taking players beyond the ruck but he stopped any other stupidness I thought. Made for a v enjoyable game. (2/2)
@BenJeffreys I thought he was very very good. Hard to see he got many calls wrong at all to be honest. He missed a bit on the offsides (1/2)
@BenJeffreys do you not think? I thought he was shit hot on the breakdown and very consistent!
Italy beating France is a HUGE upset in the womens #6Nations roll on tomorrow for #WalesvIreland all to play for, including triple crown.
@tisiphone09 @WelshRugbyUnion to be fair to them a lot of people refer to the mens team as boys (including me sometimes!)
@GazNoTan @rugbyPhilBB just watching the highlights, offside apparently??
@eirianwyn @gwladrugby yep, looks like Pete is going to have to play a lot more rugby than perhaps we wanted with our run in.
Wales wait to hear extent of Samson Lee injury | South Wales Evening Post 
@HywelV2 @cphilpott95 yeah that's because you could ruck people out with your boot. Tis never going to back to that.
@HywelV2 @cphilpott95 it wouldn't be tidy ball though would it? it would be constant offside/off feet/hands in the ruck etc.
@TimAlunWilliams @HywelV2 @cphilpott95 to be fair, that's probably more accurate.
@HywelV2 @cphilpott95 wouldn't that just make the breakdown even MORE of a mess?
@HywelV2 @cphilpott95 from an attacking pov mun! Didn't say the whole game was boring, found it absorbing and stress inducing myself!
@HywelV2 Scott's try was lovely but that was one moment of lovelines.
@cphilpott95 @HywelV2 yup, I would say modern rugby from an attacking pov can be quite boring these days.
@HywelV2 that's so depressing. I miss 2005.
PRICELESS! 
@HywelV2 oh yeah I know, but this is the same every game. It is incredibly dull (even if this particular match was a nerve jangler)
@HywelV2 no I know, but it is quite boring isn't it? heroic defence a huge plus but we need more than that.
oh booo this second match is not going the way I wanted!
No taking away from our defence and Scott's cracking try, we were still incredibly aimless at times going forward #Wales
@thepaulwilliams he's really let his fitness slip though, I'm not sure he'd even last a half at test level now.
@robindavey01 are they really? nothing like that on my timeline thankfully! When we had 2xyellow and they got a PT and he favoured us? haha!
@Sonjamclaughlan ah shit, I'd heard it was broken ankle but I think that's worse. Crap :(
@Squidgysue ha yes, definitely!
@Squidgysue I thought he was actually good. Really kept the breakdown in check. I didn't get any referee rage once! (unusual for me!)
After the first 15 mins I would never have said that would be the HT score! Great fight back by Scotland #EngvSco
@haydn_davies if only there was one somewhere, just not getting picked....
@OwainDavies15 haha always!
What the hell are this band doing? all out of time!
@Riscatrig yup, 30 by Sam as well apparently. Crazy effort.
@Ms_JulieJ we played a reeeeeeeally really bad 2nd half.
@c_kirwan nice write up :)
@Coombes1or3 @evilwelshbird 6 nil!
37 tackles by Charteris. He is so definitely back to his world cup best.
6/6 for Wales over the last week against Irish sides, here's hoping Wales women make it 7/7! What a week!
@Squidgysue ha how are your nerves? I feel like I've aged! Scotland to win now would be nice....
@rava_ian hahaha I have to tweet to try and settle myself, I'd go nuts if I didn't!
@toontotown it wasn't the 1st 40 mins we were bad though it was the 2nd 40, which is what makes it more annoying!
Nerves have gone, what a crazy game, heart in mouth defence, sheer guts from #Wales amazing performance from so many players
@rava_ian diolch Ian, those 10 mins when we kept you out the key part I think. Intense match, my nerves are shot!
YES!! Defensive effort alone deserved that, but attacking threat we were much better too, class try from Scott to really clinch it!
Awww Easterby. I do still love him. #OnceAScarlet
In, out, clear it.
SUPERB work Luke Charteris!!!
you stole the line, clear it further than that bois!!
@mickthompson83 same with all refs!
piss.
Hibbard lucky not to get penalised there, straight off his feet.
@robindavey01 not great!!
Cronin is a pain the arse! #compliment
@mickthompson83 to be fair I've loved how Barnes has reffed the breakdown, forced the players to play to the laws for a change! tis good.
@cphilpott95 I dunno, we seem to be gifting you lots of possession, this kick still doesn't guarantee it (if it goes over).
Is that the first pen for holding on given all game? what a time if it was! (think there may have been one in 1st half??)
@cphilpott95 take our your kicking game then aye, this game is still anyones though!
Alun Wyn, what an effort, lots of Wales' players have stepped up today, please lets get the win, please.
@cphilpott95 you sure he wasn't talking about Wales? ;-)
@gwladrugby nah don't be twp. That was all our own fault.
And bugger the key next point, game definitely back on now. Massive last 10 mins.
Hmm, not sure I can argue with that, they would have scored had we not pulled it down.
@cphilpott95 what did he say?
Stupid by Lydiate, that was brain dead.
Still a long way to go, next score to be key.... I am suffering from adrenaline overload.
Defence again Cymru, this is a crazy effort, forcing the errors.
@MickHaltam Roberts was superb defensively mind, huge shift from him.
Right defence agin now, don't let them hit us straight back
Scott almost dived for the line a bit soon though! Let's not mention the rare 1/2p miss...
YES YES and YES again!! Pressure in to points, da iawn bechgyn Cymru!
Scott on! Huge shift from Jamie Roberts, he was absolutely brilliant today.
Foxy really is deceptively quick. So close there boys, build on it.
we need to keep the ball more, constant defending is fitness sapping stuff.
drove them back time and time again, kept our discipline. Fantastic. Keep the ball for a bit now boys.
Fan fucking tastic defence! that was a HUGE defensive effort, Amazing Wales, superb.
Not surprised the crowd aren't happy with that call.
what?! First call I've not agreed with. He was on his feet. That was some defensive effort by Wales though, drove them back.
Great tackle BIggar, hurt his shoulder though? Shit.
Jamie down again and not looking good, was carrying his arm  a bit earlier too. That and he tackled with his bloody head.
Did we forget to practice passing the ball with our backline players today?
Congrats @Revsprop1 on your first cap! #deserved
@haydn_davies shows what I know, Rob is on!
@haydn_davies not for me no, Gethin is doing okay and I think Mike is too slow now, no changes needed just yet for me.
@bloodandmud stop it mun, I'm nervous enough as it is! think we needed a bigger lead.
Get your first up tackles boys!
And that was a lovely drop goal by Biggar, tidy boys, keep building the score nicely.
I like Sean O'Brien, I really do, but for the love of God man stop whinging at the ref. All the bloody time!
Toner did well there.
@mickthompson83 hahaha! dim probs, tis tense times!
@mickthompson83 where have I said it wasn't one? he still had a knee in the back.
Well, he had warned both sides.
Webb in big trouble, got a knee in the back from Murray I think.
Thank goodness we look like we have advantage in the lineouts as our scrums are now a huge concern.
@Riscatrig I'm very :-( S4C commentary said it was a broken ankle, nasty nasty :(
da iawn Warburton!
consistency by Barnes, fair play, that all I ask for from a referee.
Samson has broken his ankle.
gah discipline boys, stop trying to gift them cheap points!
1/2p keeping us ticking over nicely Wales 12 - 0 Ireland #WalvIre
@minded1984 I know :( injury time out lets Ireland regroup too. Lets hope this isn't a bit momentum shift.
@rava_ian :-( I am distraught, my poor Samson. Only got Jarvis to replace him, could give you a real lifeline in the scrums now.
@DafPritchard appears to be his ankle not anything to do with his neck thankfully, still doesn't look good though.
Barnes actually reffing the breakdown made me very happy but it's cancelled out by Samson looking in real pain. Oh Samson :-(
naaaaah Samson!! what is wrong? nooo no no.
winning the battle of the high ball so far but still very early days.
Dere 'mlaen te Samson....
oooooh 1/2p! #Wonderful #Cymru Wales 9 - 0 Ireland #WalvIre
da iawn Melon.
POM made absolutely no effort to stay on his feet there, completely smothered the ball, right call from Barnes.
Fend! Sexton trying to tackle high again = sit down!
"keep your hands off the floor" Yes Barnes! Please keep reffing it like that!
Perfect start, nice one, Wales 3 - 0 Ireland #WalvIre lovely kicking as per 1/2p
@bendirs1 no F needed there :) no disco light show this time which is a big plus!
100 caps for Paul O'Connell, brilliant achievement. Just don't look into his eyes Barnes! #hypnotic
@tisiphone09 I woke up at about 8 this morning then pretty much slept through again until 12, there must be something in the air!
Bonnaire. I still love him #class
woooow what a try from Clermont! Right from their own try line, brilliant offloading, loving the Top 14 highlights on @RygbiS4C
Productive morning of assignment typing didn't quite go to plan, only managed to get up an hour ago #oops
@OwainDavies15 @Steffan_Thomas1 I'd forgotten all about that! I loved Nige when he was with us, helped build us out of a huge mess too.
Lay Me Down, nice song, but do these two guys have to warble so bloody much?
@OwainDavies15 maybe, a lot of supporters seem to be quite anti-nige though which I can't understand myself.
@OwainDavies15 because Nigel doesn't suck up to whoever's in charge I'd imagine.
Wondering when @IndoSport are going to post up a correction....
@IndoSport @minded1984 @IrishRugby @rbs_6_nations well someone didn't watch the match!
well we didn't bloody hell make hard work of that! da iawn Cymru!! completely deserving victors there, should have won by more!
Discipline bois bach mun, beth sydd yn bod gyda chi?
@BarrieJones now now Barrie, you know I'm all about the positive thinking!
@paulturnerrugby @garhop genuinely don't know! didn't he take about 9 months to compile a 1 page report?
I don't understand why this ref has all of a sudden switched the scrum decisions? (but then I don't usually understand scrums :( )
@paulturnerrugby @garhop mind you we could be doing Lewsey a disservice, he might not have had much say under Lewis.
@BarrieJones very much hoping we aren't going to do what we did against Scotland!
I don't like scrums anymore.
@BarrieJones mmm, maybe. They did that first half mind, I think they want to kill the game off now.
Great game from @RyanJElias tonight #WalesvIreland #U20
This side is very good at making chances, not so good at taking them.
ooo these scrums are bloody lovely, #Wales #U20
Oh it's Josh Lewsey! where's he been hiding over the last few months?
@TimAlunWilliams because it is no longer a simple match of rugby, it is an EVENT. Or something.
"it barely needs any build up" *insert really big build up piece* yeah, okay then...
Bloody fantastic to get it just on the stroke of half time too, lovely stuff by the U20s team.
cais bendigedig! absolutely superb offloading and support lines, da iawn Cymru, love watching rugby like that!
Ireland really like tackling Wales' #7 around the neck. Repeatedly.
Hope for this match, the ref is  actually penalising the player for taking another out beyond the ruck!
@Tircoeds haha clearly your genius must be of the more discreet kind.... :)
Diolch i @Tircoeds rydw i nawr gallu gwrando i gem dan 20 Cymru yn cymraeg!
@Tircoeds you sir, are a genius! hadn't realised we had that option for this match, switching now....
@TimAlunWilliams what did we ever do to deserve this?!
oh what, Sean Holley commentating?! going to have to mute :-(
I see they've opted for the uber-pop version of Irelands call at Parc Eirias.

@Snoodlester sorry to hear that :( I used to get it quite badly.Found brisk walks used to help work off nervous energy just 1/2hr to myself
@Snoodlester definitely, I used to get what would be a sugar high, and then the sugar crash would trigger my anxiety, same with caffeine.
Finally caught up with Valleys Rebellion: 
@stephen_ntw @thepaulwilliams yep it's nowhere as bad asTMO calls going against say Scarlets out in Munster or for Cardiff away v Zebre
@Crys16_Trust gutted I couldn't make this one! Keep us all updated!
@stephen_ntw @thepaulwilliams footage still made a bad call. It's one *potential* split second error. Lam so, SO out of line.
@stephen_ntw @thepaulwilliams this wasn't the instance where one side was reffed out of the game, or where a TMO with chance to review (1/2)
@stephen_ntw @thepaulwilliams considering how many calls went FOR Connacht I think he'd be hard pressed to make an actual case.
@thepaulwilliams he completely crossed the line. We don't want our sport becoming anymore like football than it already is.
This woman just explained consent with the most perfect metaphor from @theloopca 
hapus iawn gyda'r newyddion bod @aledt10mas yn dod nol i @scarlets_rugby ! croeso nol!
“@JiffyRugby: maybe because they (scrumv) find it difficult to get access to the regions. Bristol recognise PR.”seen this @scarlets_rugby?
@serenab_ ouch at the times but loving the descriptions!
On #InternationalWomensDay I am watching #IndiasDaughter  grim but necessary viewing. Jyoti should never be forgotten.
@nickwebb2017 ah okay ta, can't believe it's been that long!
@BBCScrumV how come you've spent more time on an English club than the Welshregions who all won this weekend?
@one_mrs_k ooooo I think it's just started working!! clearly my internet connection must be rubbish!
@one_mrs_k nope, perhaps my laptop is just rubbish :-( thank you anyway!!
@Steffan_Thomas1 nah got iffy breaks on the car at the moment, don't want to risk Swiss Valley hill!
@one_mrs_k video is coming up as 00.00 with nothing to show, you don't have to be a sky subscriber do you?
@one_mrs_k hmm just tried, there's nothing loading on the video??
@one_mrs_k oooo thank you!
@Steffan_Thomas1 one of my fave ever Scarlets. Didn't agree with his coaching views but no doubting he was dedicated 100% to us.
Nice to see Mark Jones on scrumv too, always a top Scarlet :-) (and boo I missed the try highlights :( )
ooo Scarlets up first on scrumv, have almost missed the highlights!
@Riscatrig ha it's a great win, loved the Meyer try (brill finish), what a build up to it from Amos. Enjoy the win!
@nickwebb2017 is that ever or just over Irish opposition?
@haydn_davies @tumblescarlet67 well it was away from the ball, that's probs why so many missed it.
@haydn_davies could be. It was completely late (ball had gone!), didn't look like any use of the arms and completely off their feet.
@tumblescarlet67 nope if the TMO had found the right footage it would have been against Ulster.
4 out of 4 for the Welsh regions, got to be happy with that! @prorugbywales
@Riscatrig just seen you on the tellybox, you could have looked happier after that win! da iawn bud.
Bloody hell that TMO was crap, how could you miss the clear out?!
@thepaulwilliams late and completely illegal. Wtf was the player doing?
@BasilJones14 they're looking at the late claer out i think, there was a bit of handbags afterwards
Another citing coming for Ulster, that's a ridiculously late clear out!
ooooh Drags you went to sleep there a bit. Nervy 30 seconds to go!!
Feet in the air, that's a try, seriously that was brilliant #Dragons
What a try!!! hell I hope that's given,Cracking fend from Amos!and if that is a try, what a finish by the Dragons too, lovely counter attack
hahahah actually, that's a cracking line for him to follow made by the referee!
I turned the rugby on at just the right time, nice try Dragons!
@ccurts2 @PRO12rugby tried it, it's all last weeks highlights both on website and youtube channel
are there any highlights of the Scarlets match available anywhere? really want to get another look at @Pits888 try!
@toontotown @minded1984 or maybe bt just got it wrong! tis all clear as mud anyway...
@toontotown a nice, uncomplicated process then!
@toontotown ah okay, so if we finished 6th, Treviso would get in ahead of us bumping us down to 7th and so us having to go through play off?
@toontotown aye but if we finished 6th, Connacht would be 7th? I'm all confused now!
@toontotown @scarlets_rugby that's if we finish 7th, isn't it??
Seriously, Renaud Lavillenie, one of my favourite athletes ever #awesome
@thescarletway dim probs, tis a good write up :)
@haydn_davies nah it was the Welsh TMO he had a slight issue with, thought KenO took Bent out, not the other way(!)
@SouthTerracer you can't let facts get in the way mun!
@toontotown definitely. There's a nice buzz building around our team, just wish we could improve our away form to go with it!
@toontotown completely agree, been so impressed with him, a really solid player.
@Jay_P_M all of the above, I keep laughing! Not that they are wrong about needing neutral refs, but talk about being late to the table
Standouts today for me were Cubby, Barclay, KenO and I think a bit of a mention for Rawlins. Been impressed with him.
@Scarlet_rob @RobLloyd2 why haven't they been calling for it for the last few seasons like most others?
@TekVues oh but we're Welsh, apparently we're just bad losers when we have a go at the ref.
@natalier1chards but yeah being serious neutral referees are a must,for supporter perception&amp;basic integrity,we saw that after Munster game!
@natalier1chards we must prevent these erm.. injustices happening to Irish sides ever again (who cares it's happened to the rest for yrs!)
@TekVues I'm not sure that small a word can quite cover it!
It's not as though Welsh supporters have been calling for neutral referees for seasons now. I wonder what's made them finally cotton on?
Irish sides reactions to refereeing decisions  going against them. I'm not quite sure I can find the right word I'm looking for....
@RobLloyd2 Intersting comment from O'Connor, don't agree with him re: KenO but he is bang on about needing neutral referees.
@rugbyPhilBB cant say ive seen the sentiment either then! some not completely sold by him but all willing to give him a chance.
@rugbyPhilBB when has that ever trended? cant say that hashtag has ever appeared on my timeline
@rava_ian and diolch :)
@rava_ian at home anyway! Our away form is pwp.
Cracking atmosphere @official_parc tonight, superb @scarlets_rugby win! Hapus iawn! #ymaohyd
Seen y gem / Man of the match
@LlanelliRFC @AberavonRFC pob lwc!
@theblitzdefence really good write up (although I suppose technically there's no such thing as injury time!) top work.
@rava_ian have to eh? ha bet you hate that! :-P
I sympathise with Connacht as to officiating standards in the Pro12, but the officials last night were in no way complaint worthy.
@JohnKav1 haha you too!
@JohnKav1 Now I'm afraid I can't agree with you there :) #Scarlets all the way, need to make the most of this helping hand from Cardiff!
@JohnKav1 it's a step in the right direction for the league at least :)
@JohnKav1 horrible for Connacht though, I thought they'd done enough for the win, even if they were lucky not to get carded a lot earlier
@JohnKav1 aye I called one forward too, given the handling errors they'd managed the rest of game though, amazed they could keep hold of it
@JohnKav1 haha no! only the assistant refs and TMO were Welsh for this one.
@tumblescarlet67 @robindavey01 give over we needed that! Connacht would have been probably beyond reach if they'd won.
@crystalspark2 complete guts at the end to keep going, I thought the Connacht defence had enough to keep soaking up the pressure indefinitly
@JohnKav1 an Irish Scottish one I think. Ref and TMO were okay, assistant refs not the best after they got off to a howler of a start.
@stradeypark yup.They've given us a huge help, we better not undo it all tomorrow now.
wooooo hooooo!! sheer guts shown by Cardiff, HUGE help for Scarlets! #diolch would feel sick as anything if I was a Connacht fan
I don't even usually like Cardiff.
I feel sick.
yes, yes, yes!! oh PLEASE get the conversion! talk about cutting out handling errors when it counts!
c'mon Cardiff, make the extra man count! please....
huuuuuuge gap in the defence there, easy try for Connacht 5. Their 2nd rows have carried well all game.
nice one Cardiff! keep the pressure up now, points, points points.
Oh ffs just a warning.
Got to be a card, so many penalties in the same areas of the pitch now from Connacht.
Finally, da iawn Caerdydd!! I take back what I said about the turned down points :-)
not sure if Cardiff should be turning all these chances down for points.
@haydn_davies attitude is all wrong isn't it? play to the whistle not what you think is wrong!
top work Cardiff to keep them out before HT. Just one try in it, all to play for, but Cardiff need to get out of their half in the next 40!
@taffjames47 nah he's not actually been that bad, didn't agree with that particular call though!
wrong call there, Connacht player straight off his feet first.
@thepaulwilliams you cursed him!
@daf1999 what was the assistant ref looking at that he missed it is what I want to know!
amended thank goodness by going to the TMO. So, the refereeing standards in this game are obviously going to be FABULOUS. NOT.
How the hell can you give that as a try when he's pulled Patchell over?! seriously what the hell??
@tumblescarlet67 I didn't like him at the start of his career, I feel he's mellowed with age though!
@tumblescarlet67 ha I thought he was spot on! When exactly DO we like to support anyone that isn't Scarlets? ;-)
Curses Shane summed that up a bit too well, psst Gleision Caerdydd, gwneud eich gorau i ennill, ie? #ymlaenCaerdydd
I've been on that coach and I recognise that driver! #TeamWalesCoach #RafaBenitez

LISTEN: 
@stradeypark oh that's horrible :(
@eirianwyn ooo so pretty! where bouts did you see that?
@haydn_davies @CennyddW when Mr B is on form he's fine, it's just he's not on form all that consistently....
@CennyddW oh I have, but I'm not supposed to remember his name for anger reasons, but he was Scottish, and it was out in Ulster....
Desperate appeal after 10-year-old's "best friend" dog stolen from farm | Carmarthen Journal 
Also, being replaced by Barnes, let's watch another match turn into a breakdown nightmare that will make me actually hate rugby slightly.
NO Walsh refereeing for Wales v Ireland, how am I to cope without seeing his wondrous bearded face?
@LordoftheSofa urgh don't mention him, he's reffing the Scarlets match v Leinster this weekend :( Welsh refs aren't exactly great either!
@LordoftheSofa mmm true enough, would be painful transition process tho &amp; like you say,officials aren't really up to scratch to implement it
@LordoftheSofa because how can one man ever penalise 7 different offenses at the same time? Players shouldn't be going out to cheat.
@LordoftheSofa if policed it properly though,we wouldn't have a game given rate and chances of offending. Players need to do their part 2
@LordoftheSofa oh no I blame the players too and how they're coached, the tactics are sometimes just purely breaking the laws of the game.
@LordoftheSofa ha well you'll have no arguments from me on that point!
@LordoftheSofa now that I agree with but where do you start? so many players breaking different laws at the same time, referees nightmare.
@LordoftheSofa aye but if you look at the laws,they could penalise about 7 different offences each ruck. Players need to do more as well imo
@LordoftheSofa just wish they'd be more consistent in targeting dangerous play,but then I think the whole breakdown area needs an overhaul!
@LordoftheSofa  yep they always do, as ever tis down to officials interpretation, have to factor severity of it, does it affect play etc.
@LordoftheSofa @henryj17 @simonrug @PRO12rugby there's always something illegal at a ruck but shoulder charging &amp; off feet is just dangerous
@LordoftheSofa @henryj17 @simonrug @PRO12rugby see Bakkies Botha v Adam Jones in the Lions tour in SA as the most high profile case.
@LordoftheSofa @simonrug @PRO12rugby at any given ruck you can penalise probs 10 diff things, but shoulder barging off feet is a BIG no no
@LordoftheSofa @simonrug @PRO12rugby you might also want to check 16.3(a). Both of what Williams did was illegal and resulted in injury.
@LordoftheSofa @henryj17 @simonrug @PRO12rugby check out law 16.2(b) you must bind on a teammate or opponent using the whole ARM in a ruck.
@henryj17 @simonrug @PRO12rugby he didn't use his arms, there is no way it's legal.
Thanks to #Ulster Nick Williams,Aaron Shingler is out for 8 weeks with shoulder injury.Williams escaped citing tho, how so @PRO12rugby?
@Smallclone @BarrieJones @Ebenezer68 you got the Nick Williams charge on Shingler mawr at all? still can't believe that one wasn't cited.

ha mae DNA Cymru un caru y cefnogwyr y Scarlets!
Incorrect use of the term 'Celt' in DNA Cymru, other than that, tis a good programme.
@Steffan_Thomas1 @Gofer88 @GazNoTan @haydn_davies not great either, he doesn't have the tactical mind of someone like say Murray or Parra
@Steffan_Thomas1 @Gofer88 @GazNoTan @haydn_davies of course you do,but Webb doesnt even do the basics well.Snipes but that's his only threat
@Steffan_Thomas1 @Gofer88 @GazNoTan @haydn_davies Laidlaw is a much better passer of the ball, especially from the breakdown
Loving the Wales DNA programme, amazed that man from the African tribe could pronounce Welsh words no problem!

@KirstyRothwell haha love it, don't forget the Welsh Cakes too!
@JohnKav1 if Samson stays fit then I think so.Hopefully Biggar's knock not 2 bad either.If we chuck in a 2nd half like v Eng tho -no chance!
@KirstyRothwell don't know how your guys could get it so wrong, harsh times hun :(
@TimAlunWilliams yep, with two sides playing pretty negative rugby to be perfectly honest!
@JohnKav1 hahahahahahahahahahaha! now now, you know it's not.
Huuuuuuuge match in Cardiff in a couple of weeks now.
Baby faced Henshaw! Fair play, his finish for that try was lovely.
@serenab_ snap, and they've still not showed a replay.
Ireland comfortable victors but can't help but think England played straight into their hands. Poor kicking and ill discipline cost them.
@serenab_ forward pass suposedly.
@JohnKav1 cheers. Your guys looking v good even if your breakdown tactics infuriate me!
Harsh call mun, that went back.
@JohnKav1 you don't really have a kicking game without him!
@haydn_davies because their lineout has been pwp all day :)
@JohnKav1 Oh I dunno, he looked quite poorly, I reckon he may have to miss our game ;-)
@rugbyschedule carried you mean, Healy was the one attempting to tackle.
Ah my goodness Joubert you did it!! Ireland have only been doing that all game, why wait till 66th minute to ping them for it?
Prop v Prop collision, oooof! Again though Irish players going to tackle far too high.
@JohnKav1 looks like a hamstring tweak.
For the love of God will a referee please just penalise the tackler who does not release? sooooooo annoying.
@AndySlagg not really, most of England's mistakes can't be anything but just dull play (especailly the first 3 penalties conceded) v.poor.
@AndySlagg I don't think Schmidt has anything to do with an English player making such stupid mistakes to be honest!
@bloodandmud ref isn't exactly allowing a fair contest there to be fair. Stupidity in discipline however...
ill discipline is killing England today, they're going to b very disappointed with themselves.
nice vision from Murray and great finish from Henshaw to be fair, still came from a completely illegally won ruck mind!
This is abysmal, ABYSMAL, refereeing of the breakdown. Ruining the game.
Sexton gone high on a tackle again, got a mouth full of arm there I think.
@bloodandmud they just need to engage their brains, making too many school boy errors at the moment, cut those out and they've a chance.

Said nobody. 

Ever.
@thepaulwilliams it's awful Paul, just ruins the game, doesn't make it a fair contest for either side at the breakdown.
@thepaulwilliams except Joubert isn't reffing it properly, players aren't supporting their own weight when competing. It's a complete mess.
Doesn't the tackler have to release before they compete for the ball? Anyone? Or is Joubert just not applying that law today?
Psst Joubert, the men in green are going in from the side at rucks too you know....
Da iawn Gleision Caerdydd! gwaith dda yn y diwedd i dwyn y bel na nol!

Try France, that had been coming, great carry by the French 6 in the build up too. Wales need to improve breakdown asap.
@ccurts2 @tumblescarlet67 our crowd average fell by over 1,000 that season.
@ccurts2 @tumblescarlet67 against Ulster mun.
@ccurts2 @tumblescarlet67 except when scarlets actually made a SF we saw a drop off in crowds, a lot down to game plan.
My day of avoiding doing my assessment on the Education Act 2010 is going to plan. I'm going to regret it tomorrow though! #NeedADeadline
Dull as dishwater game plan but tis a win. Wish we would do more with this group of players though!
That was a superb tackle on Bastareaud by Priestland. Fair dos.
@OwainDavies15 haha well no, he needs to do a lot more during a match but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good pass.
@OwainDavies15 another Gareth Owen then I take it :)
@OwainDavies15 it was a nice touch Owain, even you can see that surely? linked up the play v well, why not applaud it?
@OwainDavies15 does that not involve his hands then?
Lovely hand from all three: Webb,  Lydiate and Biggar, top skills bois.
lovely try that, crucial time of the match too.
@serenab_ huge problems on the Beeb, S4C coverage much better quality in sound and picture at the moment!
A new France for this half! at least they're looking to play some actual rugby!
@Riscatrig I enjoyed the first half of Scotland v Italy, open and exciting even if it did have a fair few errors.
well, this match isn't exactly thrilling is it?
@bloodandmud oh I dunno, he's worked out in 20 mins that Wales' gameplan doesn't work and they need to try something new.
oh how innocent the commentator is, succinctly summarises Wales' side to side tactics not working &amp; they should try something different! HA!

that 2nd 10K tough for Sarah Storey, she's 0.77 seconds down now on the record.
No seriously, he is Kili, this is amazing. Forza Italia!
wow that's a try! #Italy
Luke McLean is looking a lot like Aidan Turner, my supporting of Italy today may have just been cemented.
Open letter from ex-Dragons chief, Gareth Davies South Wales Argus 
@BarrieJones @toontotown @RobLloyd2 i dunno Barrie, If I've chance I'll look through the last few seasons scorelines at HT and FT.
@BarrieJones @toontotown @RobLloyd2 wasn't it couple of seasons ago tho when we were winning 2nd halves but playing really poorly 1st half?
@haydn_davies it bloody gives them an extra incentive to beat us!
@haydn_davies I hate that we keep bigging that up, it makes me nervous! really vital game though, boys should be well up for it.
@JakeBallsBeard @LlanelliRFC oh god how awful, wishing him all the best but that's a tough injury to recover from.
@haydn_davies could be v important, we need to be picking up points every game.
FT 28-7 Fra v Wales, hugely hard fought 7 points, Wales fought to the end, but France's pack far too good in the end.
hearing that a @LlanelliRFC player has broken a leg? anyone know who? horrible injury for anyone to have :-(
@TekVues compared to our last trip out there in the ECC, it's a huge improvement!
@scarlets_rugby @UlsterRugby da iawn Scarlets, sounds like a hard fought LBP! every point counts #ymlaen
oooff floodgates opening now with two players down. 23-0, ouch ouch.
penalty try to Fance after extended pressure and with Wales down to 13. I'm not liking the 2nd halves in either of my team's games tonight!
@hughesbach @stradeypark @minded1984 @eirianwyn he's been a lot better than Cawdor last two games.
@stradeypark @minded1984 @eirianwyn I cannot comment, have been watching my friend play for Wales instead.
@minded1984 @eirianwyn yes, it starts off okay but then it usually develops a fault :-)
@nigel_maggs @evilwelshbird na, he's Welsh.
@eirianwyn @minded1984 I dunno we've looked worse last two games when Cawdor's come on.Aled needs to stop when his box kick radar goes mind!
Really tough first half for Wales there, unlucky not to get points towards the end, bad luck to get a yellow on stroke of HT though!
amazed we've not gone for the 3 points there, big decision to go for lineout! #FravWal
best passage of play there from Wales, great work from forwards, unlucky with the knock on in contact #FravWal
@ulsterrugby 6 @scarlets_rugby 13
@pro12rugby
@minded1984 I can't bear the NI commentary! not up to watching both on my laptop either.
@minded1984 you don't say you've forgotten the women's game mun?! #shocking
just too many basic errors at the moment, sloppy pass put us right back under pressure #FravWal
that was a crazy bounce of the ball! #FravWal, still all came from a loose kick.
wow, that is a scary, scary French pack!
@scarlets_rugby ah damo!
linkage for those wanting to watch Wales women v France 
@scarlets_rugby beth ydy'r tywydd fel? ydy e'n gwyntog iawn mas na?
@eirianwyn @scarlets_rugby @WRUWomenSupport scarlets ar BBCNI, Wales Women ar y we yn anfodus! I don't have BBCNI,going to have to choose :(
Looking forward to both @scarlets_rugby and @WRUWomenSupport 's matches tonight! pob lwc i pawb!

@rugbyPhilBB of course just ask the huge crowd that managed to turn up for Scarlets v Connacht the other week....oh...
Removing Lewis is just another step in the right direction for reform at the WRU,but the job is still far from over,so much damage to repair
@MikePullen1969  it is quite difficult to take a step back from all the anger he has caused and the damage he has inflicted on our sport!
@Ians_Iphone @paulturnerrugby should never feel that we should want the world cup out the way but sooner he goes, sooner we can start anew
Finally I am excited for the Rugby World Cup, roll on when it ends and a new, fresh start for Welsh rugby. Hope at last :-)
3,000 words later and I'm on a roll! #JobDone #Productive
Righty my mission of the evening that I should have started about an hour ago - write 3,000 words!
@serenab_ I was recommended Strava, seems okay, only had one blip with it (it doubled my run and made it look I ran amazing splits!)
@CptCatherine from first year definitely, I think I moved on to Aber Kebab and 24 hr Spar by the time we graduated. Oh how I progressed.
@CptCatherine yes you know I think you did! my main memory of that night was getting a sam's fried chicken burger on the way home!
@RugbyScarlets ha that was lovely! he had an even better rampage in 1st half though when he trampled three Munster players. loved it.
@Tircoeds not sure if it will be what you're looking for but it might help, hope it does :-)
@Tircoeds I get that quite a lot although it's not down to running, stretch I usually do for it number 5 on this 
@robindavey01 I thought this ref was actually okay, assistants not so much but they got better as game went on.
@Rhino_Phillips @TimAlunWilliams I dunno, Connacht have been v poor away from home this season and were pretty bad against us last week.
@TimAlunWilliams I know! couldn't believe it! You could have almost nabbed that with even 14 men, you'd have won it with 15 I think.
oooh that's a bad mistake from Amos, sucker punch for the Dragons after such a good fight back.
@haydn_davies all teams do the blocking beyond the ruck (which annoys me) but this goes beyond that. Needs looking at.
@wru4me is he?! sounds Irish to me!
I think I've done too much academic work today, my spelling has gone to utter shit :(
@wru4me no he's Irish, the assistants are all Welsh and just a tad bad today.
Feeling really bad for this young ref, those assistance are rubbish!
@cardiffstu well if we keep throwing away leads like we have done all season I think we might. Certainly it will be closer that it should be
@HefinRees1 I know, that just makes it worse! I still don't think I've recovered.
@HefinRees1 well, that's us back in 7th then I guess.... :(
@cardiffstu I know, I know I wouldn't normally but well Scarlets need a favour...
@CptCatherine haha I've also just remembered Tariq, you and a hat...
Dear Dragons, I ask but one thing, that you please win....
@CptCatherine aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah horrendous!
Got my first provisional marker back for my Celtic Arthur essay, 68%! now here's hoping the second marker agrees.... #boom #hapus
@minded1984 the bigger question should be what made the crowd react that way, never heard it like that before. Clear ?? over the officiating
@Steffan_Thomas1 @tumblescarlet67 @BarrieJones a lot of it depends on how people state their opinion, clumsily done it gets taken wrong way.
@BarrieJones @thescarletway @tumblescarlet67 Id rather scot/ital ref,even if theyre a lottery,would take out the bias(percieved or otherwise
@thescarletway @BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 I'd like to see a replay, it seemed such a weird call.
@Steffan_Thomas1 @tumblescarlet67 @BarrieJones abuse isn't opinion Steff,it's abuse as simple as that.People need to learn to differentiate.
Supposed to be doing some of my course but I'm still too annoyed about the rugby to concentrate, an evening of watching #Buffy it is then!
@BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 by doing what though? was it a genuine penalty?
@BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 I'd like to know what for as that call didn't make any sense to me at the time.
@BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 what did he do? I don't remember him doing anything wrong?
@BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 who made the mistake?
@BarrieJones @tumblescarlet67 we haven't had this problem at home since 1st game of season though - what went wrong??
@tumblescarlet67 true that. Just so annoyed, just can't fathom how we unraveled that much in 5 mins.
@Scarlet_rob I'm feeling worse the longer I have to think about it.
@tumblescarlet67 should have been 4, if drags don't win tomorrow, connacht will be ahead again and they've not a bad run in either.
@AndySlagg we should have, we were comfortably better than them, just all went to shit last 10 mins. So, so annoyed.
Gutted is not the word. I hate it when we've been winning so comfortably and end up with a draw. 3rd time this season! I'm a sad Scarlet :(
@eirianwyn @EnfysJones1 ooo lush!!
Praying the rain holds off else not sure I'm going to be able to drive to watch the Scarlets due to stupid malfunctioning windscreen wipers!
@EnfysJones1 @eirianwyn this! let us know :-)
The strain of behaving herself on the walk has clearly been too much for the dog, she's currently running around the garden like a lunatic.
@eirianwyn @EnfysJones1 am pretty sure that's the 16th May? we need @PRO12rugby to let us know the date for the last weekend of fixtures!
Dyfed-Powys Police helicopter base to be scrapped 
@timoconnorbl @thepaulwilliams injury is not and should not be part of the citing process
@thepaulwilliams it just turns the sport into a bit of a joke.
Heaslip: 5 weeks for 2 knees on McCaw

So you'd only get about 1 day for doing Ryu's Hurrican…
@thepaulwilliams bit beyond belief that Pape has gotten double when you compare offences. Rugby needs to sort out consistency in punishments
@stradeypark blimey, I never knew the bake off could get quite that violent...
Nooo missed the first ten minutes of #Wolfhall as the tv people have stupidly allowed it to clash with #GBBOComicRelief!
@Cheshireswanny bwell done!I've found that taking at least a day break between runs helps. I'm still at the run 2 mins, walk 1 min stage...
@Steffan_Thomas1 I can't agree. Wales has too much past history of rushing players back.
@Steffan_Thomas1 he's only two games in after a v serious injury,I'd leave him right where he is,plus he'd be more use to Scarlets right now
@Steffan_Thomas1 no.
#Buffy still has the best theme tune ever. #BtVS
@eirianwyn @PRO12rugby yep, definitely, action needs to be taken against it now to stop it creeping into the game.
As an aside, was really disappointed to see a Connacht player back chatting the ref today @PRO12rugby need to clamp down on it.
@rava_ian @eirianwyn I'd agree with that.
Scotland v unlucky but can't help think they should have won that, wasting time on handbags at the end though was v. v. dumb.
Looking at replays, Scotland so unlucky, I don't think that was a knock on for that non try.
stats for the second half make painful reading for Scotland, last quarter is going to hurt.
aaaaaaah Foxy!! he does have that lovely step and burst of speed on him #OnceAScarlet #Cymru #Ymlaen
@rava_ian gutted for Sanjay I am! Not too fussed about this match though, got the win I wanted today already :) :)
0oooo I think that could well be obstruction....or is it?
@the_black_otter I think it's bloody awful! it's been happening a lot all season but this match seems chock full of them.
why is it okay to clear a player out by their neck? anyone??
Can't remember the last time we got a tbp win, but that was a timely one! Diolch @scarlets_rugby   a lovely afternoon of rugby!
Game day!Massive game at @official_parc today,could be a huge win for @scarlets_rugby (I hope!) Get yourselves down there and back the team!
@OwainDavies15 @stradeypark haha that's actually come up with a view translation option!
da iawn @Caryl_Elin to you and all the team, cracking win!

Congratulations to all involved @WelshRugbyUnion @rhysedwards_10 
@stradeypark aye. I think Pivac has brought something new with him, but I'd like a proper DOR to be brought in.
@stradeypark Pivac, Stevo and Easterby would have been a lovely set up to have for next season.
@stradeypark dim digon arian see.
@mickthompson83 better than leading with a forearm like lots of players do though I guess!
@mickthompson83 ah yeah but thats all talk before the game to try&amp;unnerve a player,Johnny does need to look at how he goes into contact tho!
@mickthompson83 definitely being paranoid lovely
The conversion is missed.

Scotland Women 3 - 25 Wale…
Sexton might just want to stop going high on players, just a thought...
finally!!! best pass from a front rower too, a bit too little too late I fear though for #France #allez
@garethjspencer not sure it's his fault, neither side have bothered to adapt to how he's reffing the breakdown, hugely negative from both
negative tactics from both sides has fair ruined this match, France looked so much better last week.
You know France would be quite good if they could pass the ball properly.
yes matthews he "unfortunately" tripped a player. LOL.
trip from Rory Best, how stupid.
@garethjspencer I wish there was an option to mute out Matthews, he really is awful!
@rugbyPhilBB I wonder if he knows just how absurd and ridiculous he actually sounds.
@garethjspencer I'm still not sure it was deliberate, would like to see it in real time.
@rugbyPhilBB worse than a punch to the head (!)
@BBCScrumV @nickwebb2017 I've blanked the 2nd half of the U20s!
@BBCScrumV @nickwebb2017 Isn't it HT in that match already? and we (as in Wales) are winning 6-0 so far so all good :-)
Kearney doesn't let him up though or release?? #confused
@Maisie_Williams that's actually brilliant.
massive game kicking off at 5pm, just gutted I can't watch it anywhere! Wales v Scotland womens match, should be a cracker!
Morisi has ha an absolutely cracking game, hope he gets talked up as much as Joseph. What a stunner of a finish.
oh pleeeeease let that be a try, please! #Italy great effort!
I don't know how people coach Italy, how frustrating!! a try gone begging.
well, I'd say that's a dream comeback in an international for Ciprianni
oooooh, Italy, that's just too soft.
Oh Italy, as ever, if only you had a kicker!
@MikePullen1969 that was such a close call, it's not often you see tries like that awarded at all!
I think the Italians are the unluckiest team.
@Tircoeds cheers! after a 2 week break that one really hurt!
Check out my 3.3 km Run on Strava: 
@rava_ian I think it's more commentators like Barnes that come up with the stuff, then everyone uses it! no need for it imo.
@rava_ian scrum time, ruck time, maul time....tis bloody full of it!
@tumblescarlet67 is that a serious statement?
@Riscatrig ha aye! think we just got complacent, it's a bad loss really.
well, bugger, threw it away 2nd half, how can you score 5 tries away from home and still lose?!
err yeah, what was that scrum? not good!
two points behind, 7 minutes to go, dere mlaen Cymru!!
such an important try for Cymru bach, impressive considering we're still a man down, ymlaen bois.
Ddim yn hapus o gwbl bod Samson Lee yn dechrau dydd Sul.
@haydn_davies beautiful! Congratulations to you both :)
If you want to watch the U20s beat the English again, you might want to turn over to @S4C now!
@eddieballeba got 2 assignments to go to finish my 2nd year. Am doing a legal course alongside it though which is what I was doing today!
I've effectively studied for over 6 hours today, I feel cheated of my Sunday, not sure I hold with this idea of being productive...
@Caryl_Elin waw waw waw! what a win! arbennig o dda!! so proud and happy for all of you! Did Wales proud xxx
@Steffan_Thomas1 plus they were missing lots of players to the Scarlets again. really brilliant win in the circumstances.
Is that our first win against England ever at U20s?? incredible heart the last ten minutes.
but who cares, what a win!!! arbennig o dda Cymru bach!! now THAT was a rugby match, bloody brilliant bois!
there's no time for a lineout!! what the hell ref?
Fabulous by Scotland!
Allez les bleus...non..les rouge..non bleu non...merde.
@ShellyannCooke deserved result more like! we stayed in the changing room at half time I reckon....
@mickthompson83 do you think? I'm still not sure!
@Jay_P_M I really don't think he did, but very good point about the shoulder charge!
@ShellyannCooke ...to keep their focus. Decent win for you first up.
@ShellyannCooke boo to the officials! reckon Italy were worth a try there. This has been a very  stopstart match, your boys have done well..
I don't think Parisse got a finger to that, just missed, please let that stand as a try!
@TobitM oh goodness, I don't know!  *hangs head in shame*
@LlanelliRFC @NeathRugby brilliant result, da iawn!
@SamProbert79 @simonrug cheers mun.
ref is letting all sorts of foul play from both go here!
I pure loves the Italian anthem. Loves it.
@mickthompson83 looked like a hamstring tweak in the warm up, horrible for him :(
Sean O'Brien injured in warm up? that's horrible bad luck for him.
Makes you wish these protocols were in place when BOD was playing. Lost count of the amount of times he stayed on when clearly concussed.
@haydn_davies @WorldRugby I hope they do this every time a union messes up!
@BBCRadioWales diolch! hoping to get all media platforms covered for this one :-)
@MickHaltam @ccurts2 @daveiddo @simonrug @scarlets_rugby got the supporters village pre &amp; post match with loads of activities for kids too
@BBCRadioWales will you be updating on Sale v Scarlets too?
@simonrug @ccurts2 I've had this same discussion with you for the last 2 yrs I think Simon, no easy answer, but parts of media are complicit
@simonrug @ccurts2 for me the likes of scrum v seem to forget they are trying to promote a product,it's fallen into v lazy&amp; boring coverage
@simonrug @ccurts2 there's fundamental issues with the league that need addressing,but Sky still does a better job of selling it than Beeb
@SymCardiff @Ms_JulieJ @cardiffstu @simonrug yeah you can get a couple of idiots at PyS too, v. v. much in the minority though.
@GarethlEvans @cardiffstu @simonrug the build up last night was like gearing up for a boxing match, atmosphere all wrong from get go.
@markdav42 @simonrug that's four years ago now Mark, there's been a huge shift in focus on team Wales and the types it attracts.
@markdav42 @simonrug clubs sell on to anyone who can afford it(most often not their supporters)If don't sell,go back to WRU who then sell on
@simonrug To have a strong top tier you have to strengthen the bottom, been saying it for years now and quite frankly sick to death of it.
@simonrug why don't they have interest though? who has been in charge of making everything about Team Wales to detriment of rest of game?
@simonrug ...bring rugby traditions to the stadium. Club sections, choir sections, bring back singing, things that made Welsh rugby good.
@simonrug get them going back to local club rugby. Mine was always watch a bit at Llandeilo, then Llanelli, then Wales. learn that way, OR
@simonrug @cardiffstu a bit bad but I would much prefer a ground that's half full of fans who know their rugby,than full of those that don't
@simonrug You've got bandwagonners essentially who aren't used to losing,who have easy access to tickets and were pissed.Recipe for trouble.
@cardiffstu @simonrug I had a nice time at CAP (except for the bloody loud speaker music!), don't get me started on the liberty tho ;)
@simonrug ..case of rushing there from work and playing catch up  = drink too much in too short a time.
@simonrug I don't buy that. Sometimes you're on an all dayer and folks are fine and there's no trouble. Late kick off more likely to be a..
@cardiffstu @simonrug the regional game I still find really good to be honest. Think there's only once where it's gotten a bit dodgy.
@simonrug club or rugby values. The whole Welsh structure from rugby to fans alike is arse backwards.
@simonrug ...against growing the game but there's a real problem with people only watching internationals and not knowing anything about
@simonrug ...match, with tickets being out priced for the clubs it's attracted those that simply do not understand rugby etiquette. I'm not
@simonrug it's been getting worse, I've not gone to a home int game for near 3 yrs now. Ever since it's become an "event" and not a rugby...
@simonrug that's been the trend for the last 5 or so years though Simon, why such a surprise over last night?
@OwainDavies15 @simonrug sure he's banned me before :-)
@simonrug don't you usually say these are the types of people the regions should be trying to attract? The 'rugby mad welsh public'?
I wonder just how much that light show and DJ cost last night? What a ridiculous waste of resources.

@markdav42 Gatland has a history of sticking to his favourites and it backfired badly. Cuthbert, Lydiate and Foxy all bang out of form.
@markdav42 you had the likes of Tipuric, Scot Williams and Sanjay that would have been far better suited to the game yesterday.
@markdav42 Scarlets played above themselves in europe and showed how to raise performances for big games. Squad depth their biggest downfall
@markdav42 oh, so you meant Gatland picking out of form players then? Again, that's not the regions' fault.
A coaching team has unrivaled access to it's international players, yet somehow, somehow people think it's the regions' fault. Thick as shi-
@serenab_ bloody hell! that's disgraceful!
@serenab_ you've not had trouble??
@RobLloyd2 really do not want them to risk Samson if he's not 100%, he's already been rushed back from a neck injury.
@IamIDJones @gwladrugby yep. I think Sanjay looked a lot better with his brief cameo.
@drbidz @gwladrugby Should be. 2nd one was weird though,he fell like he'd been knocked out, but then moved straight away.
@drbidz @gwladrugby he definitely got looked at by a medic after the 2nd one (had a concussion time out on 1st).
Samson looks like he's aged about 10 years, hope they aren't over training him.
Watson is killing this 6 Nations drinking game #youknow
@130pmbmx I thought Biggar was good 1st half, team as a whole went backwards 2nd half.
Re not taking North off, sadly all nations have a history of it.The Irish with BOD, Australia in the Lions tour.Player welfare must come 1st
@OwainDavies15 you put that more eloquently than I ever could.
Well played England, rusty start but grew into it and played far the more imaginative and good rugby. Fully deserved win.
Well, this is just embarrassing now.
So, we're losing the second half 13-0.
Even if we manage to somehow sneak this (doubtful) we don't deserve it. Poor set piece and limited attempt at any form of back play.
@jonclarke13 @rugbyschedule he's already been off for one concussion protocol, no way he should still be on after 2nd incident.
Obstruction? think it's a bit harsh myself.
Deserved try there for England, it's been all them 2nd half, Wales have had no answer.
England have really tightened up their game mind, better subs brought on too, going to be a very tough last 8 mins.
Thank goodness they've taken Samson off! #cottonwool
Ooof, spikey really slow on the turn there.
wahey Charteris! #Tregib
@Baramenyn strangling a player? play on!
Noooo Samson bach, please be okay. Still convinced he's been brought back too soon from injury.
@haydn_davies rusty as hell but he's still been better than either Welsh winger out there! Cuthbert and North bang out of form.
High tackle on 1/2p by Haskell! You can't hold someone up by their head ffs!
The best ten minutes of this game so far have been when I was wrestling with the dog (she won).
our back play is soooooo predictable. yawn. and that was forward surely!!
@mickthompson83 aye maybe, was just a bit of a concern as he's already been off for a concussion test.
What happened to Georgie then before play broke down? looked temporarily knocked out again??
Thank goodness the post put in a cracker of a tackle.
Did we seriously just almost let the brand score? the brand?!
Lovely 1/2p seems to get a head/neck injury every time he plays for Wales. Hate to see it.
@evilwelshbird that he does, it's the one part of his game that just doesn't seem to improve. That run is lovely though!
@evilwelshbird I think Biggar shot up out the line and Webb could have done better too mind, errors from all 3 for that try really!
@bloodandmud Britain's birds will thank you.
Webb should have done better looking at the replay too.
Good feet from Joseph to get in that position and outstep BIggar but North made contact with him, should never have let him through.
Should never have scored that, very bad defence from George North, make the bloody tackle mun.
@Deepinextratime @BBCSport @SkySports tis @yclwbrygbi on #S4C every time for me, much better
Why is the Strictly Come Dancing count down to dance off music being played in the Millennium Stadium?
Drop goal, excellent way to finish the half, da iawn Cymru. #Cymru 16 - 8 - #Lloegr
Bloody hell Wales, keep hold of your own players in the lineout! #AWJ #Ouch
@taffjames47 @simonrug nah, accidental, English lad when to kick it on as North dived on it.
@WillGreenwood England certainly starting to click, have scrum dominance too, if they find the gaps 2nd half, could be very tricky for Wales
Halfpenny wedi methu!! #sioc
Sanjay #impact
boot in the face on Georgie, ouch ouch.
@Deepinextratime I was thinking that, he looked like he almost blew up for it then and there so must have been something in it.
borderline tackle on Biggar there, v borderline, would quite like to see a replay.
ah Rhys mun, edrych cyn passio'r bel!
Cais Lloegr. Boo hiss and all that.
Oooof Gethin Jenkins' face, that's what happened!
Bloody hell, what happened to Dan Biggar?
@thepaulwilliams FalEtau* ;-)
Not really a tackle there by Cuthbert, much more a push.
offload Taulupe!! Cais Webb! dechrau dda iawn on roedd y scrum na ddim yn bert!
Georgie don't be an idiot, he's clearly been with Saints for too long...

@yclwbrygbi Cymru i enill, 21-17, cais gan Halfpeny.
@delrally @EnfysJones1 Cymru i ennill! close game though, i reckon 4-7 points in it :)
@mickado15 it's just yet another wonderful WRU initiative <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@mickado15 I'd have to take half day and book an overnight hotel for a Friday night match. That's before you factor in ticket £!
@mickado15 and we've been signed up for the next two years <SMIRKING FACE> not a happy camper over here!
@TimAlunWilliams added to that it detracts entirely from the fan experience, having the day to mingle with away fans, build up etc.
@TimAlunWilliams imagine if you lived north or west Wales, you'd have to take a half day off work to make sure you get there!
Friday night Wales matches. Cementing my growing lack of interest in the international game.
@scarlets_rugby not sure I'm happy about him leaving so soon, not helpful Agen we've such a key run in. All the very best to him though.
@Cheshireswanny good luck for tomorrow! Will be thinking of you and all those mind boggling words, I bet you'll do fab :) x
@JoshDaniels10 Scott hasn't even made the bench! He has his set game plan and players, very rare he changes from it.

72 minutes, 42 points apiece, doesn't really get much closer! #MurrayvDjokovic
@Scarlet_rob Jack Payne looks a big lump too.

@PRO12rugby @GuinnessIreland why?
@simonrug @PRO12rugby bad, very bad.
my stupid auto installed dvd player thing doesn't actually play dvds! have to download an upgrade, that is saying is going to take hours :-(
@CennyddW he spies on women in the shower!
@RHIAN_MAI ah love it, I've got that one, tis a pretty handy guide :)
@eirianwyn I wasn't so bad last night, Friday was much worse! had a bad head yesterday I did....
@thepaulwilliams @JSNFRMN yep.O's and Scarlets have v good academies, but we don't have the money for experience and depth to be competitive
@thepaulwilliams definitely, and with PRW having more of a say in the Pro12, hopefully we can generate better TV deals, would be a big help.
@JSNFRMN @thepaulwilliams I'd say we're about £1.5-2million off being able to have fully competitive squads.
@JSNFRMN @thepaulwilliams yes but I think the regions just need enough to be competitive. We will never match England and France money wise.
@thepaulwilliams it'll take a good few seasons for the extra money to trickle down, need to be mindful that the WRU has starved them for yrs
Bed, pj's and Fellowship of the Ring. Oh and tea. That's my rock and roll Sunday evening sorted
James Bond really is just a massive perv #TheManWithTheGoldenGun
woohoo go Murray! #ausopen
@Revsprop1 not the result we wanted but can't fault the effort from you and the boys.
@Cheshireswanny go girl! Definitely deserved :)
I'm all set for a whole weekend in Llanelli supporting @scarlets_rugby , looking forward to welcoming the #Toulon fans in @Bendigo910 later!
@serenab_ @Gofer88 @alunj92 @OwainDavies15 yeah I'll be there :)
@RyanJonesOnline @BBCScrumV that'd be far too in depth for the show mun Ryan...
@mattiyell @HefinRees1 @RiaBurton @Squidgysue I may not quite agree...a month later and I'd have said maybe!
@HefinRees1 @RiaBurton @mattiyell @Squidgysue I went out for my first run, 2.3km (sounds better than just over 1 mile!) am a long way off...
@mattiyell @Squidgysue @HefinRees1 @RiaBurton haha! when is it exactly? I think it might be too soon for me!
See this is why I shouldn't go for a run. I now cannot stop eating.

a carefully/caerphilly joke on the teledu! someone tell George his joke's been ripped off! #scarletsontour
@scarletdruid  @itvnews to be fair their error is no way near as bad as @BBCSport was!
@Jake_Ball4 @itvnews ha not again!
Menstruation: the last great sporting taboo 
@HuwGJones310 Scarlets have got a pretty decent plan in place from what supporters get told when we get to meet management :-)
@caitlinmoran @BBCSpringwatch I rather hope that was a deliberate typo :-)
essays sent off, finally, I may really push the boat out and celebrate with a buck's fizz.
@GarrickBad @thepaulwilliams nah the christmas derbies are a tradition and big in their own right, I'd leave those well alone.
How well does Barclay have to play to get an international call up? been on amazing form for Scarlets this season!
Essay 1 done, edited and referenced. To edit and reference essay 2 tomorrow,  be such a relief to submit them #MA #CelticStudies
@DeadpanMarc that's bloody awful!! makes you wonder about the British version, really hope it wasn't anything like that one!
@thepaulwilliams @CyprusJack where have I said it shouldn't be the pinnacle?
@thepaulwilliams I'd go the first weekend the international players are back at start of season.
@thepaulwilliams @CyprusJack it is but as ever paul shouldn't be focused on  so much that it ultimately causes detriment to rest of the game
@thepaulwilliams well certainly not a day when all clubs are playing their final match of the season! I'd have it earlier on, before AIs
@thepaulwilliams local clubs play their final game of the season that day. There's one reason for a hell of a lot of people.
@serenab_ @GazNoTan it's a bit weird,why not different sections for all fans?have they forgotten there's a big rivalry between O's&amp;Scarlets?
@serenab_ @GazNoTan that's the one.
@GazNoTan not sure I fancy sitting in amongst a whole load of Ospreys fans!
@thepaulwilliams I hope ST holders actually get a choice of decent seats, far too many bad ones in the lower tier.
4,294 words, done.A couple hours break before I edit, reference and do the horrid bibliography. Then to tidy up essay no.2 tomorrow #sotired
@Cheshireswanny that's for sure! good luck with all the revising :-)
@Cheshireswanny I took an accidental 3 hour break. Up to 3,000 words now though and almost done! well, apart from referencing... :-/
Cold? Come to the Library! #CoffeeAndABook 
2,000 words,half way through. Time for a vat of tea before walking the dog and kicking arse on the other half, stupid essays :-(
@thepaulwilliams injuries have played havoc this season 2 for all regions. Squad depth will be a problem for a good few more seasons.
@Baramenyn @haydn_davies yep,a complete shambles, @EPCRugby really need to look at that and ensure it doesn't happen again. V unprofessional
@haydn_davies yep that's the one. Ref went to TMO and was told there was no replay to check (or something along those lines).

Profa mai ti yw cefnogwr mwya'r Scarlets! 

#Scarlets #inthepack …
@rava_ian @eirianwyn hahaha! the newer one it is, we've luckily changed the channel now :-)
King Kong is  a bit of a rubbish film isn't it?
@glynster61 @joshwiddicombe was he not part of a team tonight on pointless?
@EnfysJones1 nah it's mostly gone, roads had really cleared up thank goodness! and a brilliant weekend! #scarletsontour
@EnfysJones1 I got back okay :)
Thank you  @LeicesterTigers for making us @scarlets_rugby fans so welcome, a top evening was had despite the result for us #diolch
Absolutely huge game last night @Jake_Ball4 , can't fault the effort from you and the rest of the team #diolch #scarlets
@Gofer88 ha oh dear! What's wrong with it?
@minded1984 when a picture can say more than words...
An hour and a half to go until we arrive at Leicester! #scarletsontour
No more work till Wednesday! Just a Scarlets match against the odds to watch live and two essays to finish by then. Bring it on.
@MickHaltam @scarlets_rugby red wine? ;)
Just got all the supplies in for the @scarlets_rugby trip up to Leicester for tomorrow! #excited #ymlaen
News just said there's flooding between #llandeilo and #nantgaredig anyone know how bad?

@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 it's just highlighting the problem of media representation of rugby in Wales.
@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 it really don;t think it is, it's not like the England game is next week.
@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 where's their main focus Steffan?
@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 shouldn't*
@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 prominence given that our next 2 games are huge, and there's time for recoveries for Wales.
@Steffan_Thomas1 @coolinscarlet @tumblescarlet67 who says it is? doesn't mean that the effect it has on Scarlets should currently have...

@Tircoeds ah wow okay, had to google those, 1st one is deffo a v big dog!!
@Tircoeds what breed is it btw?
@Tircoeds err - YES!
@robindavey01 not disputing that, just don't see why focus has to just be on Wales, when scarlet s have the bigger concern is all.
@toontotown ah that's a brilliant idea, date duly noted.
@robindavey01 two European games a lot closer!
@toontotown any clues??
@robindavey01 I rather think the scarlet s will be more anxious....
Five hundred words and that's quite enough essay writing for my liking.Now for a cuppa made the proper way....

@stradeypark says he who's from Llanelli :)
@stradeypark I'll accept it if you accept my appalling sentence structure in previous tweet :-)
@stradeypark if you use the same mug you do. Trial and error! I'm don't strictly stick to either way anyway :-)
@stradeypark super, I just need to come up with some evil overlady name to match the status :)
Have now remembered why it's been about 7 years since I got my eyebrows waxed and was relying on tweezers. Proper ouch!
@serenab_ on a wholewheat bagel with some smoked salmon?
Today is just a little bit mugnificent #Stevo #Scarlets
@scarlets_rugby @StephenMJones10 and this news make me just the tiniest bit happy. I  may be understating that somewhat. Brilliant!!
@scarlets_rugby a huge thank you to Mark for all of his commitment to the club, both as player and coach, a true Scarlet #diolch
@Squidgysue @UKCycleChat hope you've got yourself a polka dot jersey!
@serenab_ I'm a newbie runner too, just been put on to @TheRunningBug , loads of helpful advice on their website!
