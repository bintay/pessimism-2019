@BlackLovenm @FCBayern I don't know but Guardiola-Bayern doesn't works out anymore and Pep doesn't deserve this amount of hate!!
@BlackLovenm @FCBayern and a new coach
@BlackLovenm @FCBayern imagine playing like this against Barcelona it would be a disaster, a rap festival. Bayern fans doesn't deserve this
@BlackLovenm  do you think it doesn't hurt? I love him so much but there's no future for him in this club,injuries are not an excuse anymore
Let's admit it Pep Guardiola was never right choice for @FCBayern ! he is destroying this team and he is destroying himself! let him leave <BROKEN HEART>

@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets I do find Götze overrated but accusing him why he talked to a friend after the match that's really stupid!
@andreabarzagli2 she is so cute! Happy birthday Andrea <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets plus Bayern has Beckenbauer to be "realistic" to the media he criticizes everyone! Pep has a another job there
@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets but what he says to him in the dressing rooms is an other thing media doesn't have to know that
@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets meanwhile everyone the media, the fans are criticizing Götze Pep's job is to defend him is his player he has too
@iMiaSanMia NO  @BSchweinsteiger NOO !!!!
@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets honest and realistic he is with his players and the board .In the media he will always defend his players always
@barcastuff sure the players are united this is barcelona not real madrid !;D
@effbee25 @iMiaSanMia what happens in the dressing room , what he discuss with his players media doesn't have to know that !
@effbee25 @iMiaSanMia we will never said a bad word for his players to the media he will always defend them it's typical of Pep Guardiola :)
always defending his  players and blaming himself well that's typical of Pep Guardiola! now tell me how not to love this man?! <SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jubagaier @GuardiolaTweets he 's just defending his players like always even when they have their weakest performance that's typical of him
@effbee25 @iMiaSanMia the problems he discuss them with the board and his players not with the media
@effbee25 @iMiaSanMia what did you expect him to say this is shit ,over,we're really bad?he's trying to keep the spirit up and be optimistic
@iMiaSanMia he is defending his player for god sake ! he needs to keep the spirit up and motivate the players what did you expect to hear ?

@ProvyHernandez I'm sure he did !

@Christa_MD he is blamed for absolute everything this season!don't know if I want him to stay he has everybody hating him right know !insane
@Christa_MD what do you think he has to stay or leave?
@Christa_MD Sky Sports clams that he decided to leave after the defeat last night! I don't know if it's true!!!
Pep Guardiola is leaving @FCBayern in the end of the season! The team wanted him to stay but after the defeat last night he decided to leave
@laolu_dee it's not about the defeat, I feel exhausted! it's easy to hit some when he's weak
@laolu_dee @Tospet_Akints don't worry you will survive !
@laolu_dee congrats you for the victory! you're the one that won not me ! you have all the right to make fun of me !!!
@laolu_dee @Tospet_Akints nobody asked you to care!!!
@yonome he blamed himself for that !that's the only defeats I blame him for !but accusing him for absolute everything that happens is insane
@yonome he has also commuted mistakes I know that, you are right to be angry but accusing him of destroying Bayern is too much !!
@yonome they have been terribly unlucky this season with all the injuries! during all season he had only 50 % fit can't blame him for that
@barcastuff ever considering changing your avatar??
@yonome take a deep breath calm down man ! you have the right to be annoyed but he is suffering too he is not enjoying this,is not a traitor
@ProvyHernandez congrats!!
@Tospet_Akints he will not return! and I'm done with barça !
"Who is Pep Guardiola?" - barça's fans right now! good kids <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@lady4Guardiola: Bayern 's fans want Guardiola out! Can't blame them maybe this is the best for the both parts!! 
@Tospet_Akints I'M NOT GIVING UP ON HIM !!difficult to understand? this is over we are not going to Berlin my love for him will never change
@AWegele even if it isn't true he is the one that will be blamed and hated! maybe even get fired
@FCBayern may fire Pep Guardiola!!!!
@iMiaSanMia maybe they are right, maybe Pep Guardiola is the one to blame for what happened tonight! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@GuardiolaTweets this is the exact moment when he is full of himself thinking he is better then Pep !
@barcastuff Guardiola the one on your avatar!
@Tospet_Akints thanks for your advice! but NO I'll support him until the end
you will be blamed, you will be cut into peaces !you will have the word against I'm sorry! Stay strong Pep Guardiola
