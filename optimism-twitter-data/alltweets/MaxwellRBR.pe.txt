@iChrisCastro @aestheticstevie @RobIMatter @MattKnicks1 RIP CONOR THE CRUSHER &lt;3
@RobIMatter "This pie is like climbing Mount Everest...LET'S DO IT MAIGGLE." was the best thing I d ever heard.
I'm so ugly that @TRNRebel won't even look at me :( :( :( 
Jesus Bryce and D'Angelo Steel just tore the house down at @ugwrestlingcom!
I could watch Danny Scott wrestle forever and not get sick of it.
The High Priests were revealed to be Beauty and The Beast, who have won the Underground Wrestling tag team titles! @ugwrestlingcom
Kirby just got a big pop. Best ring announcer in wrestling. This is going to be a lively crowd. Can't wait! @ugwrestlingcom
AHHHHH IT'S TIME FOR @UGWRESTLINGCOM!!!!
Come out to @UGWrestlingCom in Villa Park tonight! Enjoy the action, swing by commentation station, and enjoy some beers!
@TheMMAPodcast @FrontRowBrian Rafael Torre won every match.
@TheTylerVolz @sonnench @K_Mel91 Hey @FreelanceWres, four man booth?
The PWG crowd chanting "ayahuasca" for Matt Sydal is so rad.
Just had a dream about accidentally being a party to grand theft auto. Time to go back to sleep!
"Bulls Beat Cavs."  
@K_Mel91 NAH MAN HE MEANT 2 BANK IT MVP MVP MVP I LIKE KIRK HEINRICH

Tomorrow night! @NotThatTomGreen and I will be speaking into microphones at @UGWrestlingCom!
@joshuachapa That is exactly what the show is.
Unrelated: are there any black guys Skip Bayless doesn't hate?
Know what you're talking about before you shit on someone's ability to do a job, especially when they've already done that job well before!
Being a commentator requires a few things: knowing the game, being an interesting talker, and getting guys over. He has those traits.
He's going to be great.
Watch his season of the Ultimate Fighter. All he did was put guys over!
Wrestling fans trashing Chael are fucking stupid. "HE WONT KNOW HOW TO PUT PEOPLE OVER!"
Am I still allowed to use the word "thug?" What if it's just as a joke?
@TheBarrylad @PaulGriffin It's actually about ethics in gaming journalism.
@AngelusLayne @PaulGriffin 
Fight Master &gt; Ultimate Fighter Season 21.
.@PaulGriffin can text me about Uhaa Nation, BUT HE CAN'T DESIGN MY "I'M A GUY" T-SHIRTS!
@FrontRowBrian I think you mean "latest information speaks highly of his piece."
@newfoundmass I used to do it in college, and now I feel like I'm going to vomit if I just think about it. Oof.
Ariel Helwani practically blaming the fighters for the Reebok deal being shitty on The MMA Beat was so transparent and disgusting.
.@BillSimmons Want to do a wrestling podcast with me? No? I understand   :( Good luck.
@justinisntfunny That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.
Squirtle has the best character arc in the Pokemon TV series.
This has been a long week. Can I get a beach house in South Carolina now?
The key to making a good movie trailer is to show someone with their eyes closed under a shower head looking torn and perplexed.
Dusty Rhodes sitting on a truck and being like, "OH BAY-BEY, TRIN-EH-TEE, THOSE ARE SOME NITH TIT-AYS" was the best era of TNA.
I think "Everything I Own" by The Front Bottoms has reached top-5 GOAT status on my favorite songs list.
@PKolehouse All of their songs get me right in the feels.
I just got sent a picture of my female doppelgänger from @StepDaddyFinnin, but don't worry; my tits are way better.
"I was a Rosebud? BETTER PUT 'WORKED FOR WWE' UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT SECTION OF MY FACEBOOK PAGE!" - Indie goobers
BUT WHO'S GONNA PUSH MY WHEEL CHAIR AROUND WHEN I GET SICK?!
@MaxwellRBR "I mean if you like people doing coke this is will be a g…
Nothing better than when you go to take a dump and you see blue water. You get to take that clean toilet's poop virginity.
@FurysFightPicks I kinda like how zany that is, but I also don't like Masvidal at 170, but I also think he should fight someone better?
I kinda want Chipotle, but I don't know if I want blood stains in my underwear.
@FurysFightPicks I feel so bad for these guys. What a huge deterrent to signing with the UFC, or even getting into MMA in general.
CRAZY MORNING. SALES. HELPING CUSTOMERS. SIGNING PAPERWORK. DIET COKE.
@GeorgeGatton @CurtRobinsonPro But seriously, that's awesome to here. Keep outworking people, you guys.
@GeorgeGatton @CurtRobinsonPro I dunno man im fuckin fat. hard 2 believe some1 else is hungrier, m8.
.@podjohnnyringo *atomic drop* OH SHIT I DONT KNOW IF THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO LET THIS ONE CONTINUE!!!!!!
.@podjohnnyringo I make it a point to mention the athletic commission, which does not exist here, on EVERY FUCKING SHOW.
@justinisntfunny NOT LIKE THIS BRUTHER GONNA GIVE TOO BIG OF PAYOUTS N NOT PROMOTE THE SHOW PROPERLY
I'm going to blow a small fortune running an indie fed in Springfield in like, 15 years, so hit me up if ur interested u guyz.

Just because your value isn't always seen doesn't mean you should …
@NotThatTomGreen @UGWrestlingCom EXPOSING THE BIZ
I'll never understand why some companies don't book @SugarDunkerton. Always gets over, he's courteous, and super professional.
@K_Mel91 I actually LOL'd at that.
AHHHH @UGWrestlingCom this Saturday! I'll be in the booth with @NotThatTomGreen while the best in the Midwest battle it out!
@THEjoebrowne @Marty_McFly44 YEAH IN THAT GIRLS DASH AWAY FROM ME WHEN THEY SEE MY FACE LOLOL
@THEjoebrowne @Marty_McFly44 Samez. He's ugly as shit, and that's coming from me!
Shit may float, but the cream ALWAYS rises to the top.
Sometimes, the only way to get to the promised land is to put everyone else on your fucking back. It sucks, but that's the truth.
But if you keep outworking people, there's always a chance that things can turn around.
I hated work. Personal/family life was a mess. No hope.
Like, really hopeless. 2013 was the worst year of my life, no question.
I was hopeless as fuck after graduating college. So weird that two years after that, I'm so confident about the future.
I have a job I love with normal hours and good pay that will be FUCKING FANTASTIC pay as time goes on. Didn't think that'd be the case.
I would be working more for less money with an exceptionally lower ceiling.
When I was in HS/College, I would've KILLED for a sports management job. Now, I wouldn't even considered it.
Irish men have been voted the sexiest men in the world. People always think I am Irish. I am the sexiest man in the world. #Dadbod
.@WilliamRBR and his probably correct predications are the worst. 
I can't wait until I have a house on the god damn beach in South Carolina.
I for one, am STUNNED, that a professional athlete would do something against the rules to gain a competitive advantage.
Beadle now taking the, "wrestling fans are unemployed mouthbreathers" stance that she uses to hate.
.@sonnench Welcome to the commentary business, good brother. You're going to kill it.
Let's keep the #dadbod thing forever.
@GeorgeGatton @smvrobles You told him to shoot me out of a cannon, you fuck!
@smvrobles @GeorgeGatton THANKS FOR THROWING ME UNDER THE BUS ROBLES.
Even if there is another world war, we will always have Don West's shoot promo on Mike Tenay.
@GeorgeGatton Me and @smvrobles were talking about how much we hate you on Sunday, YOU SELFISH PRICK.
"I drove 160 mph on the Autobahn."
"I taught in South Korea."
"I woodwork with hand tools."
#Jeopardy 
But it's super hypocritical to take that stance when her network gives Floyd Mayweather 90% of his publicity.
Floyd Mayweather IS a piece of shit. Let's not forget that.
Michelle Beadle won't watch WWE because they support Floyd Mayweather, but will gladly take her ESPN paychecks.

#RAWlternative returns on 5/18! Please visit the Facebook event page for more info. 
FUUUUUCK STOP GIVING ISIAH TEAMS.
I think Cole is that good. If anything, they probably just let him do his thing. He did his homework.  
Michael Cole had one of the best commentary performances I've ever heard last night during Zayn/Cena.
@daz_gun Good stuff!
@daz_gun Yes

:)
Going to watch the rest for tomorrow. This isn't good, but it has had some okay moments.
"Everyone keeps saying I have an accent but I'm from America." - Bucky Larson.
SECOND LAUGH! 

Guy: I thought you had some kinda fetish for cheese.
Bucky: Oh no I don't use fetish cheese I use velveta.
Paul Blart 2 may have a tough task!
Adult store manager: We don't have kiddy porn.
Bucky: I'mm allergic to cats. 

*10 second pause*
OH SHIT I JUST SNICKERED. We've got one laugh so far!
This is the most vile, unfunny shit I've ever seen.
RICHARD GILMORE IS IN THIS MOVIE?! WHAT THE FUCK?!
This is like, the least funny low-level improv scene ever, except people thought, "THIS IS GOOD!" and still went with it.
FUCK, this acting is sooooooo bad.
One minute into Bucky Larson, and I'm already appalled.
I will send a fruit basket to whichever company made the better movie.
Tomorrow, I will watch Bucky Larson. Next week, Paul Blart 2.
Two weeks ago on @RBRwrestling, we talking about Bucky Larson and Paul Blart II. I will be watching both movies to determine which is worse.
The government should pay mixed race people $30 every time a white person asks them, "WHAT ARE YOU?!"
@sarahannevers Your status is MEAN and RUDE, particularly to people of middle-eastern descent.
I imagine that hemorrhoids feel like having to watch season seven of Gilmore Girls on loop but in your butt.
@sarahannevers WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT.
I want to be Richard Gilmore.
@aestheticstevie I found a fed online when I was like 13 and asked my parents if I could join. My dad was like, "Are you shitting me?"
@TheBarrylad I've never understood the "THEY'LL RAISE THEIR KIDS TO BE THAT WAY!" argument.


The most important video you'll see all year #wow #inspirational
No it's, "I'm really slow, but I definitely won't try and stab anyone else on my team."
I used to be able to say, "I'm really slow, but I have a few good post moves."
At my skill level, that's devastating.
Just played basketball for the first time this year, and I've gotten noticeably worse at every aspect of the game.
I wish I was watching Velocity from 2003 instead of Khoya.
Josh Matthews called the "Tower of Doom" the "Tower of Power." JVC TOWER OF POWER?!
Watching Impact for @RBRWrestling. Khoya is the worst wrestler I've ever seen.
@TheBarrylad @WillHousell because she waited for it to become a hot button issue so she could build her #brand.
@TheBarrylad @WillHousell No, Triple H looks like a fucking idiot for it. But she knew about this BEFORE. She didn't say anything until now
@TheBarrylad That's where we disagree, I guess.
@TheBarrylad when she works for fucking ESPN.
@TheBarrylad She also kissed his ass in an interview less than a year ago and is now saying that she didn't know about his abusive past
@TheBarrylad in the context of something with victims who are much, much worse off (2/2).
@TheBarrylad I think there is a bit of a moral issue in the fact that she's portraying herself as a victim (1/2)
@TheBarrylad I don't think saying, "let's help these people" is grandstanding. Twisting a serious issue to be about yourself is.
@TheBarrylad She's making it about herself when she has a platform that she could use to legitimately help people.
Forget Beadle. Let's actually help women affected by domestic violence. It's about them, not our grandstanding. 


Yes, leaving her job ASAP per sources (JK SHE ALREADY FAILED ON FS1).  
Michelle Beadle could post a link, like this. 


She could be using her platform to raise money for charities or shelters. She isn't. She's making it about people appeasing her.
PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO ME GUYYYYYSSSSS I WANT TO HIJACK SOMETHING AND MAKE IT ABOUT MEEEEEEEE 
"I WONT WATCH WRESTLING ANYMORE!" Great, you solved domestic violence.
Michelle Beadle doesn't give a fuck about battered women. She only cares about making her #brand bigger by making this about her.
@PaulGriffin BUT #MILLENNIAL #FOODIES LOVE #GUAC #ORGANIC #SMDH #NBD #BRAND
@justinisntfunny If "Gay" were somehow a relevant, clever insult, shouldn't they have chanted, "GAY R FOX" instead?
@justinisntfunny Of course you would think that...*tries to stifle snickering* Justin *snickering* HOMO. AHAHAHAHA U GET IT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
@justinisntfunny "AR Gay."

Every boxing aficionado expecte…
This is her attempt to claim some kind of new identity and establish some form of relevance. It is transparent and sad.
No one cares about her. Just trying to get her name in the news. She's not the hot journalist anymore. She's just an unfunny person.
Michelle "CM PHILLIP PUNKER BROOKS IS A FUCKFACE" Beadle is an immature hypocrite who is seeking attention because she's irrelevant now.
@JensenClan88 Freshest take I've seen on this.
@WillHousell AND SHE WORKS FOR ESPN.
People know Mayweather beats women. You aren't trying to inform, you are trying to draw attention to yourself.
Floyd probably won more rounds than I initially gave him, looking at the stats.
@WillHousell Well, it's a shitty comparison.
PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEEEE 
@WillHousell He's also not a known woman beater.
@aestheticstevie Next weekend after Underground.
@aestheticstevie &lt;3
Thinking of starting a YouTube show called, "Burying the Scene" w/ @aestheticstevie.
Skip Bayless is a racist shit.
But split decision because boxing.
115-113 Mayweather.
106-103 Floyd
96-94 Floyd
87-84 Floyd.
77-75 Mayweather.
67-66 Mayweather.
I got it at 57-57.
That was Floyd's round. I have it 48-47 Pacquiao.
I have it 39-37 Pacquiao.
29-28 Pacquiao #MayPac
19-19 #MayPac
@PaulGriffin do u like my art #IFollowYouPleaseFollowBack
#MayPac 
I've got Floyd by Split Decision.
@ChrisDoesTweet Floyd by Split Decision.
#AgeOfAdaline The guy is weiner cousins with his dad.
Pacquiao's best bet is getting this fight to the judges. Mayweather once lost a judge's decision after clearly beating his girlfriend.
Pulling for the improbable double-knockout tonight.
@FurysFightPicks NOT PICKING ANYONE IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO THE PEOPLE PICKING SOMEONE. I AM SUPER OFFENDED.
This is worth discussing.  
I have a feeling that after tonight's fight, America will be reminded as to why we don't give a shit about boxing.
I need a commentary young boy.
It's "WHAT PART OF A CHICKEN DOES THE MCNUGGET COME FROM AM I RITE GUYS?!" levels of lame.
That's probably the most stolen hack joke ever.
At least we're more accepting as a society now; We're all going to watch two guys fight over a belt and a purse fuck I'm a hack I'm sorry.
I don't care about Spousal Abuser vs. Donald Trump of the Philippines, but I don't really have anything else to do tonight...
@SugarDunkerton Necks are for weak people who want to live past the age of 45 because they think they are TOO GOOD for steroids!
@aestheticstevie I miss you, miss you &lt;3
@smvrobles @RickeyShanePage @MarkusCrane So few guys that unique and creative.
@SugarDunkerton NAH BRUH GOT 2 HAVE THE MUSSULLS BECYZ THEY MEAN UR STRONG N TUFF.
WOW! He's really weird but also a dick! HE MUST BE A GENIUS!
Gonna start treating everyone like shit so people will think I'm a genius.
Diego at 145 sounds like a bad fucking idea.
May have just had my best work poop of the year, you guys.
@justinisntfunny get the fuck out of here w/ ur maturity u dick
@FurysFightPicks @MikeBohnMMA What do you think can/should be done to prevent this?
@TheAaronJHarvey @RBRWrestling Now you can think of me when she sucks your dick :)
I don't think people are making enough of the fact that THE HUMAN TORNADO is on the next @FreelanceWres show.
@nickmaniwa @AngelusLayne @viahiptop @Jessbeesknees My wife was born in August, so you're all a bunch of dicks WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN US.
I've used it before, but now I'm going to use it consistently.
Is it okay that I am definitely stealing Kevin Harlan's, "RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES!" for wrestling commentary?
@areas_shane WHAT THE FUCK?! WHY?!
@areas_shane WHAT HAPPENED?!
@JoeySplashwater Do you get the vibe that Harlabob hates him? Because every podcast they do together there is a weird tension.

Nikki Bella has, pound-for-pound, the best ass in pro wrestling.
@aestheticstevie Screenshotted 4 future blackmail.
@aestheticstevie I wanted to stop watching.
Watching the first Land Before Time, and HOLY SHIT is this movie depressing.
Great to see @FreelanceWres as a part of #RAWlternative. Can't wait to be heard.

h…
Pokemon's themes are p progressive.
@lob_3 HIS WIFE IS HOT. YOUR CITY WILL HAVE ONE MORE HOT WOMAN. TAKE THE DEAL.
@lob_3 DAMN IT
But seriously, that's really fucking cool and kind of surreal.
OMG IM IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE UNDER MY GIMMICK NAME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING MARKS AHAHAHAHAHA
@lob_3 FUCK WHAT HAPPENED?!
If Cerrone still gets the title shot for winning, I really like his odds against a "worried about drug testing" Dos Anjos.
Makdessi vs. Cerrone is kind of a let down, but if no one steps up, you gotta do what you gotta do.
I just want to lay down while someone applies Goldbond to my nether regions, na'am sayin?
Good sales lead to the WORST adrenaline dump.
@TheBarrylad @SammyJ_D Barry's just upset because I stuck my index finger right up his pooper and he couldn't do shit about it!
@PKolehouse BUT IT'S ABOUT ETHICS IN GAMING JOURNALISM.
@PKolehouse For what reason?
And you would also have the, "well, serves him right" crowd.
THOUGHTS?!
You would have the gamer-gate types being like, "SHE'S AN EVIL WHORE BURN HER AT THE STAKE!"
I think overall, the median stays the same. BUTTTTT
If Hillary wins the next election, then had an affair in office, is there more, less, or the same amount of outcry as when Bill had one?
@TheBarrylad y?
TUNE IN NEXT WEEK BECAUSE THE OLD GUYS WHO DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER!
HERE'S A BORING C-LEVEL FIGHT!
HEY THESE TWO OLD RICH GUYS WHO AREN'T GOING TO FIGHT EACH OTHER REALLY DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER! WOW!
I made the mistake of watching the second episode of this season of The Ultimate Fighter. OOF.
I want to go in an isolation tank SOOOO BAAAAAD.
@RobIMatter will pray 4 u 2.
@justinisntfunny You and me both, buddy. You and me both.
My posture sucks. Gonna start working on that.
.@jeromepwpeditor @SammyJ_D I'm built like if you gave a leprechaun a shitload of HGH, then never let it work out.
@SammyJ_D Me standing next to Acid Jaz, and I'm slouched. 
@SammyJ_D '6"6.
@JohnnyGargano DEAD.

Nev: Do you want to meet finally? 
Catfish: I don't know. I can't 
Nev: Come …
@TylerMoliterno Yes. I'd be p bad on a reality show.
Basically in wrestling for the friends and the fun. Not interested in working for promoters who don't believe in me or respect my abilities.
Working on a super secret project for @ugwrestlingcom tonight. Stay tuned.
@ColtChamp18 @MaxwellRBR 
@FurysFightPicks I think it's the whole, "if he acts this way, he doesn't get to represent our organization" thing.

-You're retired
-You're not good as an analyst
-You were involved in a double homicide

Please leave everyon…

Because it's totally his bad that he's been plugged into the #UFC…
"Hey pussy, are you still there?"
@IVPvideos He's a treat to watch in the cage.
.@jonjones Does it bother you that the UFC is taking away your articles of clothing when you are simply a content curator? Pretty effed up.
Jon Jones lost a lot of things today...but the biggest one, is his smile. @FrontRowBrian @superCalo

#RapeCulture
Apparently UCONN's logo promotes rape culture, according to something I just read.
"Hopping on one foot, yelling, 'COME ON!' then high-fiving fans" is a really popular gimmick on the indies right now.
@TheBarrylad OH YEAH?! Well yer da types "
I don't know what the fuck my life would be like had Verne Gagne not existed, and that is a testament to his legacy.
In all seriousness, if it weren't for Verne, my grandfather wouldn't have been a wrestling fan, and thus, my dad wouldn't have been.
Very sad to here of Verne Gagne's passing, but on the plus side, at least now his roommate can relax a little bit.
@PaulGriffin Wasim got suspended from Twitter.
"YOU KNOW WHAT ROI STANDS FOR?!

Radio. On. The Internet."

UGW... ht…
@PaulGriffin Because they think they can be CM Punk.
Horror movie idea: a guy gets into an Uber and Jon Jones is the driver.
"I toured with a bluegrass band."
"I watched cartoons in Mexico."
"I was almost left on a trip."
#Jeopardy htt…
I'm blocked by Angelina Love because of the time that I suggested Vince Russo ask her, "what's with your face?" 
That was a tricky one, but it's from The Ultimate Fighter.
Let's play a game called, "The Ultimate Fighter, or Gay Porn?"

Guy 1: LET ME BANG, BRO!
Guy 2: I WANT TO, BRO!
*Billy Corgan comes out with a guitar*
"The World Champ is a Vampire"
*DUN DUN DUN DUN…
I think we can all agree that wrestling promotions funded by Billy Corgan have an exceptional track record, yes?
@DonBradio I love the second possibility.
I love how when the pedophiles try to run away, Chris Hanson ALWAYS gets his shit in. "I'm Chris Hanson with Dateline NBC!"
To Catch A Predator is still the best.
Finished up filming for @FreelanceWres! Tune into WCIU TOO on May 2nd at 2 AM! 
Finished up filming for @FreelanceWres! Tune into WCIU TOO on May 2nd at 2 AM! 
@proudcaucasian u shudnt b able 2 wresle n e more bcuz u were mean
Kevin Love suffered The Maxwell Injury! No fun.
Not watching because people can't beat him is off base to me. You should be watching; he is a once-in-a-generation fighter.
Demetrius Johnson is must-see TV.
Demetrius Johnson is the most athletic, most technical, and most intelligent fighter at 125. I can't imagine anyone knocking him off.
I don't know how anyone at 125 can beat him.
He doesn't make mistakes. When someone else makes one, he instantly capitalizes.
Demetrius Johnson is fucking ridiculous.
Oh hey, I'm being filmed for @FreelanceWres's television show today!
Almeida's basement is a faster Mizugaki and his ceiling is UFC Champion.
If you can be that tactical while your aggressive against other top guys in the division, you're going to be a very tough out.
He's going to be a problem for EVERYONE at 135.
Good gravy, Thomas Almeida...
@TheTylerVolz I just watched that one like, a week ago. They had such great chemistry.

That hit so many satirical and real talk bases that you earned it sir.
What are the best WCW/WWE Cruiserweight matches ever?
@GeorgeSuchy Hardest I've laughed in weeks.
One of your fans was going to punch my wife, guys.  
If you don't like Jared Leto as The Joker it's because you're a mark who hasn't spent a day in the business and doesn't get it.
@buffalochipster A couple people told us to, "Go home!" And I gave them the, "I remember MY first playoff win!"
@SirCalBaldwin She was confused as to why I turned, but was like, "Oh, someone tried to punch me? Huh."
@buffalochipster Like, that was the most fun I'd had at a game UP UNTIL THAT POINT.
In short, it was a great night. But I will probably never go to a @Bucks game again because a drunk fan was going to punch my wife.
Don't be a classless shit who tries to fight someone because they aren't paying attention to you trying to get under their skin.
We came to see a great basketball game. We saw one. We were happy.
And it's funny, because I always criticize the idea of fandom. "YEAH I LIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE TO WHERE THIS TEAM PLAYS MOST OF THE TIME!"
@buffalochipster Yes, leaving the stadium.
I didn't make a fist or anything. I just looked at her like, "don't you fucking dare."
So I kind of made a woman think I was going to hit her, but it was morally acceptable because she was going to punch my wife?
She cocked back to throw a punch, and I turned toward her and she froze.
This girl was walking next to her waving a towel, and was pissed that she wasn't getting a reaction out of her.
So a drunk female fan, COMPLETELY UNBEKNOWNST TO KRISTINA, tried to start a fight with Kristina.
That was awesome.
Bucks coaching is sooooo gooood on both ends.
Pau's rat hands...
OJ Mayo picked a good time to play up to his contract.
@Beefamania Yeah.
@TylerMoliterno i r ded
@TylerMoliterno What happened?
Bucks half-time show is awesome.
I want a trampoline-assisted 720 over a blimp in the next dunk contest. 
JIMMY. FUCKING. BUCKETS.
Bulls need to ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK. No more lazy post-entry passes.
Bucks defense is on point.
NOTE: you can't yell "ball don't lie" if a free throw WENT IN, and you are cheering for the opposing team.
Stunned that the people here LIKE O.J. Mayo.
The Bucks just had a promotion where you HOLD UP YOUR CREDIT CARD ON THE JUMBOTRON TO WIN. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.
This will be a home game for the Bulls.
Let's basketball! 
MILWAUKEE. We're here! 
Disgusted how many people I've seen sticking up for pepperoni after @RBRWrestling. The folks at BIG PIZZA have you brainwashed!
@Zakinater My brother-in-law is from Racine! It's...kinda scary in some places but nothing compared to Chicago.
@MMAStateOfMind We need to go at some point. I'VE NEVER SEEN MMA IN PERSON.
@MMAStateOfMind I wish I could be, but I will be out of town for a wedding :/
FUCK advertisers are out of touch.
HOW CAN #MILLENNIALS RELATE TO #SPIDERMAN'S #BRAND UNLESS HE POSTS #NBD ON #SOCIALMEDIA?!?!?!
The email about turning Spider-Man into an EDM loving Tough Mudder who posts "NBD" on social media because #Millennials is the dirt worst.
@TheBarrylad bitch I got money
@TheBarrylad &lt;3
Aisling Daly is my least favorite fighter.
MILWAUKEE TOMORROW I CANT CONCENTRATE FUCK YEAH
Pawnsylvania is a very underrated Kroll Show sketch.
Our seats for Bulls/Bucks tomorrow. 
But I always FEEL like an asshole. I'm constantly worried about the judgment of others.  
Me:....Because then I feel like an asshole.
Co-Worker: You say that a lot. How often do you feel like an asshole?
Me: 100% of the time.
It's like Uber, but for circumcisions.
@smvrobles If you pay for  20% of the tickets, you get to be WORLD CHAMPION.
@smvrobles Wanna help fund my all ticket-seller promotion?
But if you want my money as a fan, have ticket seller battle royals. Those are fucking hilarious.
Do be "The ____ of ____." Be the first you.
The point is: there is one PWG. They ARE the market for PWG. Don't be PWG. Go do your own shit. Make your own identity.
"We're like the PWG of ____" triggers bad images in my head of Young Bucks wannabes tweeting about making towns and doing crooked moonsaults
If you describe your promotion as "The PWG of ______," I assume that you mean, "We have guys that do a lot of spots, but not very well."
@EmilySUPERMARIO That's a strong response. A little TOO strong. Probably because pepperoni eaters use performance enhancing drugs.
@EmilySUPERMARIO FUCK OFF. Pepperoni is WORSE THAN BALOGNA.
COMING SOON: "I'M A GUY" shirts! Let people easily identify your gender while mocking shitty, uncreative t-shirts! 
Are you a woman who identifies as a man? YOU CAN ALSO BUY AN "I'M A GUY" SHIRT!
@GeorgeGatton Just kidding that's not my scene :(
@GeorgeGatton I'm Evan Bourne ready! *winks incessantly while making a blunt motion*
@GeorgeGatton OHHHHH cool stuff man. Good luck!
@GeorgeGatton ORLY? Surances? Or something different?
@NotThatTomGreen @GoodTimesTilley I am not capable of carrying anything, mostly because of my weak lower back.
FUCK YEAH SALES
This is the Ultimate Fighter's version of the AWA's team challenge series. I'm not sticking around to see who gets the turkey off the pole.
And I'm like, as big a TUF fan as you'll see. It's about the journey, not the quality. Now there is no journey.
Last two seasons were filled with terrible, low-level fights. This one is that but without the satisfaction of a winner. COOL!
New Ultimate Fighter format...OOF.
@BDenny411 Nah, don't want to tear a hamstring.
GOT A SALE ON THE BOARD WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR FUCK YEAH TODAY IS GONNA BE RAD LETS ALL HAVE A PARTY WOOOOO!!!!!!!
@AngelusLayne I'm glad that you also appreciate hating Michigan.
@MojoMcQueen @UGWrestlingCom PASS. HARD PASS.
Hey @UGWrestlingCom, I don't have to interview @MojoMcQueen in the ring again, do I? Asking so I know if I need to bring a change of pants.
@beyondwrestling Plz include @FreelanceWres.
@SelloutxRecords Peoria is like, progressive, by central-IL standards.


This is Scott Steiner bad :(
@buffalochipster Does it? I've honestly heard a lot of good things.
@WillHousell People there are proud of their awful state. It's terrible.
"I DONT LIKE THE MEXICANS BECAUSE THEY ARE LAZY AND TAKING ALL OF THE WORK!" racists.
But like, delusional racists who haven't actually met any people of other races.
Also, don't attack Illinois like it'll hurt my feelings. It's a murder hole, some hipsters, rich assholes, and a bunch of racists.
I will be taking down EVERY shitty garbage state. So far, I've gotten Missouri, Michigan, and Ohio. WHAT COULD BE NEXT?!
OHIO IS SO COOL WE HAVE CHILI
Yes, it and it looks like what your state is: runny diarrhea SHIT!
OH BUT MICHIGAN TOUCHES A BUNCH OF THE GREAT LAKES
Yeah, and your state has six total jobs.
Why do people from Michigan and Ohio act like their states are great? They are both shitty garbage states.
What is the origin of, "THE GAY COMMUNITY?!" It's the best audio clip ever. What is it from? What led up to it?
@bellegenerico GAY COMMUNITY?!?!
"I don't want anyone to watch ROH and think, 'there aren't enough heel stables!'"  ~ Someone at ROH.
If you had to choose between never clipping your fingernails again, or never clipping your toenails again, which would you choose?


Remember, you guys: unless you get super fucking rich you'll never be able to retire.
Thought about making a Kickstarter to get myself booty scrunch leggings, but then remembered that people use it for real causes :(
MILWAUKEE THIS WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!
#DoYouEvenHaveAWeirdLookingPairOfLeggingsOnBro?
Probably going to buy myself a pair of Kaitlyn's booty scrunch leggings to cheer myself up.
I slept like shit! Don't go to bed angry, kids!
@AngelusLayne This happened to me on vacation once and now I can never go to South Carolina again.
I will still be me. You will still be you. And I am better than you every goddamn day in every goddamn way.
No one trying to hide behind their lies and arrogance can change what I have. Nor does it undue their very real mistakes.
I have love. I have a great job. I have great friends. I have a home. I have clothes. I can deal with this shit. It's nothing.
Maybe when I wake up, I'll feel better. If not, I'll take the steps to feel better. It's that simple.
Going to bed next to the beautiful woman who's always had my back. Shit ain't so bad.
Maybe I'll get back into writing. Maybe I'll start boxing again. Who the fuck knows.
I really wish I knew what the next step will be.
I will find value in something, surrounded by people who find value in me.
I've put too much work into myself to be okay being stepped on.
I will figure it out. And I will feel whole.
Not sure what I'll be pursuing next.
Accepting my irrelevance.
FUCK.
@K_Mel91 @FreelanceWres @ZackBraxton Institutional racism.
At least Florida has beaches and culture.  
Sooooo many people in central Illinois talk about Missouri like it's paradise. Missouri is the worst. Last state I'd ever want to live in.
Missouri is a racist garbage state and that's a goddamn shoot.
My employer is THE. FUCKING. BEST.
Bulls/Bucks IN MILWAUKEE on Saturday, getting filmed for TV on Sunday. My life is pretty fucking rad.
Going to Bulls/Bucks in Milwaukee on Saturday.
"Yeah but ____ does it for free." FUCK THAT. Don't have your show look unprofessional as fuck.
Braxton, Jerome, K-Mel, myself, Tom Green, St. Holmes, Prazak, Colvin...don't book shitty commentators when you have these resources.
There are like, two bad commentators in Chicagoland and 15 good ones. It's inexcusable to use the bad ones.
Matt Turner and Anthony Franco could talk people into the building, brother.
fuuuuuuck 
You can remove one word from existence forever. Which word do you choose?

I'm going with "epic."
I still hope Michael Sam catches on. That said, spreading misinformation about why he hasn't doesn't help anything.
Would he be more likely to get another shot if he wasn't gay? Maybe, but based on what he's shown, maybe there are more deserving players.
Like, I wanted the guy to make it, and thought he could, but did you follow his performance at the veteran combine?
Just read a Gawker interviewer where someone claimed Michael Sam was, "basically thrown out of the NFL" for being gay. The fuck?

If you're wrestling promotion isn't utilizing @NotThatTomGreen...that's your loss.
@NotThatTomGreen Seriously? :/
NOT A JOBBER. HE WAS AWESOME.  
@MMAStateOfMind I was hoping he'd go back to the UFC. He's a workhorse, but he's also limited in some ways. Don't see him winning a title.
Mikey Batts was shit. Jerrelle Clark should've been a goddamn star.
YOU ARE WRONG.

Thinking about starting an EWR game and ruining my life for a week.
Is it common to tip a delivery driver just a few bucks? I always go 20%. I've been told "$2 is acceptable." They're an asshole, right?

I love when mortgage companies get upset with us for not engaging in fraud. Sorry, shit head. Not risking my career for your paycheck.
@JoeySteelCage There is honestly a massive difference. Banks are waaaay more upfront and organized.
I completely understand the mortgage crisis now.
OH HEY WE FUCKED EVERYTHING UP AND DIDNT PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR EMAILS AND LIED TO OUR CLIENT CAN YOU HELP US?
I'd rather eat Louie Anderson's ass than have to deal with mortgage companies.
I've never felt worse for an interviewer than @sonnench when he was talking to Douglas Crosby. I hope you're okay.
@NINaylor My wife will ask if she can have, "just the top." Why would I want cupcake if I couldn't have the top? It causes serious problems.
Listen to me on @AboutNothingToo before the show even hits iTunes!


wen some1 has bacon donuts 
.@AboutNothingToo was a BLAST. I will tweet the link when it is available.
About to head to @BDenny411's place to record the first episode of @AboutNothingToo! I'll be talking NBA, wrestling, and sales!
@VAGentMike Norm is so perennially under-appreciated :(
@jeromepwpeditor Oh, they TOTALLY smoked in high school! *nudges incessantly*
@jeromepwpeditor It says that college kids who JUST got into weed are the CrossFitters of drug users.
@JacquelynIwema I thought that would be your jam.
Plz tweet TNADIXIE and tell her that I would appreciate an offer to do commentary even though I won't take it because I make more money now.
Oh, hey @TNADixie.
Gonna watch more Curb on my break.
@MMAStateOfMind WILL WE SEE PHIL DAVIS IN GLORY?!?!?!
I can't wait to have "fuck you" money.
Clearly Will is struggling with this whole "loop, swoop, and pull" concept.  
@Bob_Voss @AboutNothingToo yes
Tonight! I'll be on the first  @AboutNothingToo talking about wrestling, the NBA, and sales!
Watching Curb Your Enthusiasm for the first time. It's p good!
@smvrobles but you said you VQ is fair and I don't know what your definition of fair is, and I'm not watching a grainy Mr Ooh La La.

@SammyJ_D @nickmaniwa did.
Thank you to all the #TBDUGW live-tweeters spreading the word about @UGWrestlingCom. It's a great product. Get on board.
Jim Ross is upset with WWE making a Russian Chain Match for Extreme Rules. He thinks it should be a Slow It Down a Little Bit Chain Match.
@GuapoEmilJ Please let me know any commentary advice that you have.
@VAGentMike He's awesome. In the title tournament he wore a different mask for every round.
@nickmaniwa Not acceptable name by me?
@VAGentMike @NotThatTomGreen thnx
@nickmaniwa Honesty, I almost stole Excalibur's call and caught myself half way through because I'm a shitty mark.
@nickmaniwa Is that not what it's called?
@NINaylor Are your comps still available in any form or fashion?
@0cmel Not trying 2brag but if I was not in ur speech class fresh yr u would b homeless n awful.

That's one for the religious crowd.

@NotThatTomGreen THAT'S A THING?!
@jeromepwpeditor @JoeySplashwater 3Deep5Me
@BDenny411 But imagine if you REALLY didn't give a shit and had assloads of money. Wouldn't you dabble deeper?
@PlayerTypeZero I think I heard October - December.
@PlayerTypeZero Oof. As long as Punk wants to be there? I think the more he wins, the longer they keep him.
Oh, a rich 20-something who previously had a DUI partakes in cocaine?
Jon Jones doing coke is, really, one of the least surprising sports stories of the year.


99% of the time I forget that people I know from not wrestling follow me on here. Sorry, you guys.
@bradentstone Yup.
You know the sport is watered down when they bring back a guy who's career highlight was washing out six years ago.
PHILLIPE NOVER IS BACK IN THE UFC?!


PLZ fav that so I feel less shitty
That was a joke.
But to be fair, she was a sleep during, and before we had sex.
I just want to talk but my wife's asleep which is soooo typical
I wake up after sex, like I'm a chick or something.
Poor kid. 
Big Show and Kane chokeslam each other at the same time and they both disappear forever
@kennysutra @ThatRobbieFox Glad you're alive, man.

@BDenny411 @AboutNothingToo Let's not set the bar too high.
@ThatRobbieFox @kennysutra I'm told he's alive and doing well. BUT HE WONT BE AFTER @iChrisCastro and @MattKnicks1 BEAT HIS ASS, YEAH!


.CHECK OUT THE KARMA @kennysutra GOT FOR GIVING ME A CONCUSSION, CTE, AND BREAKING MY GLASSES! WHAT A DICK!
As far as the Reebok deal, give Joanna the same champion cut, and split the rest amongst the division until the picture is more clear.
You wouldn't see that in any other division.
No one has fought anyone yet. Let's wait for things to settle out. JoJo was #6, and she got wrecked by a debuting fighter.
I almost feel like, until the sport evolves more, we should only rank like, the top 5 women's strawweights. The division is a mess.
Matt Riddle is ALWAYS SMILING. He might get signed based on that and credentials alone.
Stardust would welcome Matt Riddle to the #RealityEra. #UFC is fake. #WWE is for real fighters #LetsGoJhonCena #JhonCenaSucks
Matt Riddle to WWE? Pfft. Jack Swagger beat Cain Velasquez in college and he's not even on TV. WWE &gt; UFC. #MMA #UFC
@EmilySUPERMARIO Unless it's Luke going Benoit on everyone, I doubt it :/
My iPhone autocorrecting "apple" to "Apple" is probably the most arrogant thing I've ever experienced. I'M NOT ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT YOU!

Was Paul Walker black?

Because the last time I saw him, he was pretty ashy.

@GPA_123 "I do feel worse."
@THEjoebrowne I &lt;3 u
@GPA_123 She seriously did like your work, though. She liked you and Garrett in the six man.
@GPA_123 "I'm really worried that I might have hurt his feelings. I feel really bad."
@GPA_123 "I should've included him in the first batch."
@GPA_123 "Oh! I love him too! He was also my favorite!" -Kristina, the racist, just now. Ugh.
True Life: I Married a Self-Hating Honkey.
"You can have favorites without being a racist!" - Kristina

Sounds like something a racist person would say.
Kristina's favorite wrestlers at Freelance are Sug D and The N-Words. She only likes the black guys. What a racist.
@ItsBRob Yes
@ChrisDoesTweet Today's card? No.
@MMARoasted @ChrisCamozzi So happy about this.
AHHHH CHRIS CAMOZZI IS BACK FUCK YEAH!
@MMAStateOfMind But they have "hot."
Moroz vs. JJ?!

So...number one contender is???

@TheHunterAAK Financial consulting and financial services- both great industries.
@theTomRichards @ZackBraxton Damn. Next time!
@ZackBraxton @K_Mel91 OHHHHH SHIIIIITT.
@K_Mel91 BECAUSE HEEL.
@TheHunterAAK Once a guy tried to take my chair and I didn't know it was a wrestler, so I freaked out but then was like, "Whoops! My bad!"
Wrestling is p cool.
@TheHunterAAK Some guys like to tell me how they're going to lay things out. Others give me tidbits.
@TheHunterAAK So that way, the guy who goes under is no worse for the wear, and the guy who goes over looks like a million bucks for winning
@TheHunterAAK I'm told who's going over, which is good, because then I can put over the guy who's going under more.
To me, he is all about making others better. That's my job as a commentator; to make the performers in the ring come across better.
He's willing to help others. As a commentator, it's my job to step aside. It's not about me. It's about the guys in the ring.
He embodies selflessness, support, and hard work. That's what I want to be. That's why I chose his name.
I picked Mark because I wanted to tip my hat to him. I hope I can be half the father he is some day.
He fully supported me getting into the business. He made me a better person. I couldn't have asked for a better dad.
Cheesy story time: the reason I am Mark Maxwell is because Mark is my dad's name. He's the one who got me into wrestling.
You're god damn right I'm a Mark (Maxwell).
The best part of being a commentator is getting to suspend my disbelief. I get to feel like I did about wrestling when I was a kid.
It makes you feel like a kid again.
There's nothing better in pro wrestling than when you feel like two entities genuinely hate each other. It becomes so tangible.
Yes, you are a bad person. But you also understand the value of what's at stake. You can put that over. That's what K-Mel did.
Also, when the DVD/VOD is up, @K_Mel91 did the perfect put-over of the tag belts. Heel commentators should do stuff like that more often.
Pull-apart brawls are awesome, especially when the guys involved bring their character into it. Props to @aestheticstevie &amp; @RobIMatter.
YOU ARE AN ENABLER PIECE OF SHIT @ZackBraxton
.@FreelanceWres put on a spectacular show last night. 4 Star Heroes vs. Cum N Go angle is HOT. Can't wait to call the street fight.
Apparently CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem, so you guys won't know I have it until I unexpectedly pass away next week.
I WILL NOT ENTER THE RING TO BREAK UP A SCUFFLE EVER AGAIN. I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON. #CTE
No hangover for this guy! 
Why isn't LaRue Burley in the UFC? Who else does he have to beat?
@SirCalBaldwin @FreelanceWres No heat- just my fault for not understanding the benefits package.
@SugarDunkerton What a novel concept. Everyone does well, everyone makes money, fans get awesome shows and endless options.
.@FreelanceWres where do I submit my workman's comp claim? Kenny Sutra gave me 9 concussions last night when he pushed me.
INJURY UPDATE: I think I actually got NINE concussions off that one bump, because my urine was a tad bit more clear than normal #BanBumping
@smvrobles You're probably right.
I'm legitimately terrified of doing drugs. Was scared of drinking until I was 21.  
@SugarDunkerton Bump card is full. Only had room for one bump. Very sad. I'll never be the same again.
You know when you feel pretty normal? That's actually a concussion. #BanBumping
I think I have eight concussions and CTE.
I'm never bumping again, you guys.
#12Large
Thanks to @FreelanceWres for having me last night. Good luck to everyone at @UGWrestlingCom today!
So...pro wrestling is pretty fucking cool.
Maaaaan, Kenny Sutra broke my glasses. Fuck that guy! @FreelanceWres

@celfiesta @TheReedBentley @nickmaniwa BECAUSE I'M NOT BOOKED, TERRY!
Just gave a shoutout to @ThatRobbieFox on commentary.
But honestly, Bentley is a fucking treat on the mic. So good.
I may or may not have said on commentary that I once tried to kick @TheReedBentley in the balls but @nickmaniwa's head was in the way.
Four Star Heroes vs. Tripp Cassidy and John Wayne Murdoch w/ Reed Bentley was FANTASTIC.
World's Cutest Tag Team vs. The N-Words was an EXCELLENT match. @FreelanceWres
Standing room only, if that at this point. @FreelanceWres packing the joint real tight, na'am sayin?
Drinking and commentating &lt;3
Every body is making money. Everybody is having great shows. What a time for independent wrestling in Illinois!
This is why we can 
Gonna have to punch fans who think the commentary table are seats. Shoulda gotten hear earlier! #SuperNoVacancy.
Looks like another sellout for @FreelanceWres. Can't wait to call the action! 
@SirCalBaldwin @K_Mel91 K-Mel is black, but that's still racist.
Gonna pull a classic rib on @K_Mel91 tonight where I shit in my bag and then blame it on him. Foolproof.
@WillDangerZone You'd probably be my second choice. Joe Cadena is just so, so handsome.
Tonight at @FreelanceWres: Who will win the tag belts?! Will @SugarDunkerton lose his pants?! Who will steal the show?! BE THERE!
I JUST WANT TO GET IN THE BOOTH WITH @K_Mel91 AND @ZackBraxton AND TALK ABOUT WRESTLING!!!!! AHHHH!!!!!
@RealDaveRoberts No, and now I'm kicking myself for it. Thanks a lot, Dave! There were tons of cute boys I would've loved to have blown!
MOTHERFUCKING @FreelanceWres TONIGHT!!!!!
@JoeySteelCage In a program to have one within two-three years.
I know I went to a Christian high school because freshman year I heard two girls arguing about if you could get pregnant from a blow job.
@JoeySteelCage Only reason it hasn't happened is because I'm under the necessary age to have my own office w/ this company.
Road crew tonight: @TheTylerVolz and my wife. All three of us are gonna do a shitload of coke and bang a bunch of rats.
I hope he's still alive tho.
Remember Old Guy New Guy? FUCK OLD GUY NEW GUY!
More sales than the rest of the office combined. Freelance tonight. Motivation level:

@bucky4everyone DEAD
Commentary has a huge effect. You have someone who can alter the perception of every performer on your show. Don't play games with that.
I just wonder if promotions understand how harmful bad commentary is and how helpful great commentary is. My guess is, they don't.
So they stick a friend out their who tries to pop the boys, get themselves over, or do whatever, thinking it has no effect on the product.
Sometimes I get set that bigger places don't book me, but then I remember that success in commentary has almost nothing to do with merit.
Look at how many big companies have shitty-to-average commentators. It's absurd.
@ZackBraxton @FreelanceWres DO YOU WANT A RIDE TO THE SHOW OR NOT?!
?!?!?! @TheTylerVolz  
@GeorgeGatton Ur gettin buried on the mic friday jus so u nvr get booked in this territory
@GeorgeGatton You told Jack to shoot me out of A FUCKING CANNON.
@oldewrestling No clue. Also, I would love to work for you as any olde-time commentator.
FRIDAY NIGHT! @FreelanceWres! BE THERE! World's Cutest Tag Team, Robert Anthony, and many, many more!
"Kane was there too!"
@jimlamotta @dEReK_DiReCTioN I get wayyyy too much of that.
@TylerMoliterno DAMN

I'm p excited for season two of Silicon Valley.
.@TheTylerVolz Umpoorpoor Pitifulme could be the next Great Khali.
That would be a great gimmick name for a foreign character.  
JK, but some of them...
"I'm kind of like a bad ass shooter and I do a running forearm in the corner." - Every indie wrestler when I ask about their character.
Unfamiliar with this word. Sounds like it's about plants and/or tort law.  
Oh boy, sounds like a real dandy.
I will be watching Raw in the morning. I avoided spoilers. Describe the show in one word.
.@Duke_MBB congrats on covering up this rape strong #brand plz rt 

 
Congrats to #Duke, and upstanding program that overcame so much #adversity 


I know he's only in that AT&amp;T commercial because of affirmative action, but the idea of Christian Laettner having friends is insulting.
@PTownBrave22 Schools are in an arms race to spend money. That's the only reason anyone is losing $$$.
@PTownBrave22 They should get minimum wage for time spent in sporting activities or the NCAA should start being a real non-profit.
@PTownBrave22 They shouldn't have to with the money they bring into the school. And LOL at the idea that they're getting an education.
There are 80k in attendance and constantly commercial interruptions, but at least I know the players won't be compensated &lt;3
Someone's getting #worked. 
ALL HAIL "WHITE CHEDDAR" FRANK KAMINSKY, THE GREATEST #BUZZCUTS PLAYER EVER.
@ProWrestlingTs Thank you for getting @FreelanceWres, and in-turn, me, on TV. I am forever grateful.
#LetsGoBuzzcuts
BREAKING: During his interview with Chris Jericho tonight, John Cena will reveal that the favorite moment of his career is his next one.
None of y'all wanna talk about rape accusations?
I get that it's a hypersensitive issue, but their apology is purposely constructed in a way that makes it seem like what they did was fine.
Rolling Stones "we weren't tough enough on our rape victim" apology is...something.
@jeromepwpeditor @voiceswrestling Indie wrestling is all about promotion rivalries because people get their rocks off on it for some reason.
@kelsierotert go eat a bowl of dicks you dumb cockmonger.
AND THAT, is a swerve, you #marks.
For committing a face mask, I would rather watch baseball, probably, because Ray Rice is a sack of shit (2/2).
I'm not saying baseball is awful, but if I had to choose between watching a baseball game or letting Ray Rice go unpunished...(1/2)
Me: I wonder what's going on in the world!
Twitter: A bunch of guys you don't give a shit about are playing the ball and stick game go team!
If I get one more sale I'll have 3x more than the person in second on the leaderboard.
I did not miss baseball twitter.
When you HAVE TO SEAT FANS RIGHT NEXT TO THE COMMENTARY TABLE, your product is worth watching.
People are sleeping on @UGWrestlingCom. They've been packing the place to "there's fans sitting next to me at the commentary booth" levels.
Freelance, DreamWave, AAW, and Underground all running in a two day span. What a time to be a fan.
Any good indie shows in Illinois this weekend? LOL.
.@Scientology do i have 2 pay to lern about zee new
@nickmaniwa :(
@THEjoebrowne Ahhhhh, the "takes steroids for the competitive sport of bar fights" guys.
@kelsierotert Their response: 
"Not sure I want to be with a girl who's handled 56 chalks at once."
@THEjoebrowne Less overweight women in short skirts struggling to walk in heels?
Sometimes you just gotta roll the dice and snapchat people a picture of yourself taking a shit. #BadAss
You know what is racist? Saying that Andrew and Aaron Harrison look alike. Just because they're identical twins doesn't mean they look alike
Am I supposed to be offended by Andrew Harrison's comments? Like, I really don't give a shit. He can say that.
@TylerMoliterno Insecurity. We all have our skeletons. Makes us feel better if we know others made mistakes as well. It's fucked up.
@TheTylerVolz YOU JUST DON'T GET IT YOU FUCKING MARK
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS! #HappyEaster 
LET'S FUCK WITH THIS KID'S SOCIAL LIFE FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS! @Lantz_16 @espn
@K_Mel91 I am saying that I made a gross generalization.
All of my black Facebook friends are talking mad shit about Wisconsin.
@Jon_Poppe no, my tweet about whites being better at basketball.
Was that one a little much?
That was a joke.
Tonight, we were reminded of the lesson Hoosier's taught us many years ago- whites will always be better at basketball than blacks.
Harrison Heroball time.
Beautiful.
@Jon_Poppe I honestly was thinking Flagrant 2.
“@darrenrovell: ReForty and O?” OOF.
NO CALL?! Holy shit!
Baaaaaad charge call
@PaulGriffin @ringofhonor THE BOYS DONT APPRECIATE IT U MARK #THEBIZ
I'm thinking about re-watching Bruno some time to determine if it really was that bad.
Why do college teams never try for a 2-for-1?
I was really worried that this basketball game wouldn't have a shitty musical performance before it.
Sup. Heard we look alike. 
@jasonchapa BAH GAWD WHAT A NIGHT
@TheTylerVolz I think it's pretty cool, and it's a fun card. With no college football, the day time Saturday sports market is wide open.
@lob_3 Let me know if it's worth checking out. Always seemed like an interesting promotion.
@aestheticstevie I like her butt.
.@WilliamRBR I forgot all about punk rock Rosa Mendes until I just listened to you bring it up on RBR. That shit was so bad.
@ThatRobbieFox IT WAS!
“@WilliamRBR: ICYMI, please visit @MaxwellRBR's Twitter for correct opinions about #AJLee.” Thank you, Will.
Also, AJ's butt was vastly overrated.
Best part of this whole thing: I bet that fans will chant for AJ Lee now.
UFC SHUD DO A HOT FEUD WHERE A GUY STEALS AJ AND HE FIGHTS CM PUNK FOR HER POSSESSION #BOOKING
ALSO IF THIS IS A WORK I CALLED IT
AJ 2 UFC SHES A SHOOTER THATS WHY SHE DID A REAR NAKED CHOKE ON RAW SHES GONNA FIGHT ROUSEY
MAN I REALLY WANTED TO SEE AJ WRESTLE THE SAME PEOPLE EVERY WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS THIS SUCKS
WHO IS GOING TO FEUD FOR THE DIVAS TITLE NOW?! UGHHHHH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE FRESH FEUDS WITH EQUALLY CAPABLE WORKERS SO SAD #RIPAJ
RIP AJ NEVER FORGET
And if someone can "choose" to be gay...who gives a shit. You don't have to have sex with them:
Anyone who thinks gay people "choose" to be gay is just a gay person who is trying to fool themselves into thinking they can be straight IMO
About an hour left of work, then it's off to my future stomping grounds- scenic central Illinois!
Iggy Azalea...would you?
@crystalli0 Never less than $4.
@pwponderings I'm booking him for my nephew's birthday party.
OH MY GOD, THOSE RTs. I had no idea Morey was so post-human. &lt;3 Zach Lowe.
@lob_3 Yes.
@nickmaniwa That was beautiful.
"Can we please drop the Horsewomen gimmick? It's Rousey and three fighters no one would care about if they didn't hero worship and leach."
Female Flock?
What would be a more fitting name for the Four Horsewomen? 

Mean Street Pussy?
@TheBarrylad congrats you son of a bitch 
"I feel like we're currently witnessing the 'Mongo Era' of the Four Horsewomen."

DEAD.
People wrote those jokes for Roman Reigns to get him more over. That is all. Good bye.
@celfiesta 
@GeorgeGatton @Jackcameraguy I got really worried for a second :(
@WillHousell @PaulGriffin FUCK YOU, YOU DON'T GET IT YOU DUMB FUCKING MARK!
Hey, @PaulGriffin, remember when we worked those marks? AAAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA #TeamBestie
@PaulGriffin It was getting worse. I had 90% vision at the beginning of the show. Was overwhelmed by blind spots toward the end.
@PaulGriffin @TheEliSteele I told you I was going to only do the Mania segment before the show. Did you need a written notice?
@PaulGriffin I had a migraine dude, I couldn't fucking see.
“@PaulGriffin: @MaxwellRBR you'd have to have actually been there” I was. You had the chance to speak up and you didn't.
@PaulGriffin The fuck? Why could you bring this up when we were on Skype? Or during the show?
@celfiesta @nickmaniwa "we're both pretty." *weird making out* "we're not a thing anymore"
@celfiesta @nickmaniwa UGHHHH THEY WERE BOTH THE MOST DULL EVER.
hey @PaulGriffin 
@TJHawke411 @kford13 
@kford13 Because the guy who he killed was named Johnny Graziano or something and I thought it would be funny to switch the two :(
@kford13 Also, I will shut up...AFTER I'M ON FAN-TO-FAN.
@kford13 At least you're not riding with Nick Hogan? #RIPJohnnyGargano

AWESOME DAY. Love my job, love my wife, love my life.
Eight sales for the day. GIMME A HELL YEAH!
#Millennials probably loved that last tweet because it makes them feel like my #brand is their #friend because I'm #relateable #NeverForget
#Millennials LOOOOVE social media based shows because they are so #relateable #RELATIONSHIPGOALS #Hashtag #KONY2012
@jeromepwpeditor Watched Going Clear this morning. So good.
Hillary Duff's new show is "'Sex in the City' for Millennials." I expect lots of shitty "hashtag" jokes and social media-centric LOLz.
Plz recommend a documentary for me to watch.
@TheBarrylad OH FUCK YOU MY MOM SAYS IM HANDSOME!
@TheBarrylad I woke up yesterday with maayyyyybe 25% of my vision.
@TJHawke411 Who do you think he meant to DM? President Obama, maybe?
Man, today started so so so so so well. No migraine, business is moving. What a step up from yesterday.
@TheBarrylad Yes, per sources...sources = @williamrbr
@RobIMatter wut
"I just want to be remembered as the greatest of all-time. Is that too much to ask?" - BJ Penn
I missed yesterday because of my migraine, but I've got six sales on the board today and I've only been in for two hours. Back on track.
Already making April MY BITCH.
@BonesawSkull One of us doesn't make millions of dollars for the given activity.
@TJHawke411 That suuuuuucks
@TJHawke411 An anti-corporation group called OUTLAWS INCORPORATED. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.
@TJHawke411 OH NO THE FINAL BATTLE MATCH WHYYYYY?!?!?!?!
@TJHawke411 Ughhhhh I had just finished suppressing those memories...
wen ur daughter asks daddy y does no1 like u 
Thanks for your prayers, @RBRWrestling  neighborhood. I'm feeling much better now.
@hypegotti This killed me.
@beyondwrestling @FreelanceWres on 4/10
@DWWrestling Shane Douglas...or a tie between Rose and Cage.
@SammyJ_D that's a popular hashtag 
@jeromepwpeditor She's ridiculous.
@jeromepwpeditor Very excited for it. Such a great clash of styles.
@aestheticstevie Fuckin pot head
Yes, I AM bitter about the fact that no one has asked me to do customs commentary in nothing but a man thong. #BookMarkMaxwell
Last week on @RBRWrestling, it was #TheAristocrats. This week, it will be #StanzasCutFromLannyPoffosHallOfFameSpeech
@jeromepwpeditor Rats, bruh.
I'm gonna be on TV!


Just watched last night's Raw. Tune into @RBRWrestling to hear my thoughts.
"Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn't."
@AnimeKing420 DEAD
@winordyetrying I will
Probably going to bed early and watching Raw in the morning. No spoilers plz.
“@AnimeKing420: anyone else think rusev is going to get marc mero'd?” start talking about how all of his friends are dead?


Mark Maxwell sounds like a sexy individual. Check out @FreelanceWres on WCIU TOO!
"The whole thing got totally out of control, way worse than the Jones/Cormier brawl."
The amount of MMA fans who think the Ronda Rousey shit last night was real is FUCKING MINDBLOWING.
.@FreelanceWres (and Mark Maxwell) are coming to your television screen! WCIU TOO!
Maaaaaan FUCK allergies.
"I'ma get on this TV, momma
I'ma, I'ma break shit down"


@MMAStateOfMind She got a MASSIVE reaction as well once she started talking trash. Came across very well.
&lt;3 
@TylerMoliterno Something about a Texas billionaire assaulting a midget within the confine of a steel cage REALLY spoke to me.
@nickmarsico @TylerMoliterno I LOL'd. Fuck you.
.@TylerMoliterno I remember explaining to a teacher in HS why the JBL/Hornswoggle cage match was why I love pro wrestling.
@TylerMoliterno NOOOOOO
Hey @TylerMoliterno, who has more followers now?! 
@TheTylerVolz &lt;3
@WilliamRBR @BrianSlater1976 And as a HEEL, which no one would've believed.
@SammyJ_D NXT w/ Jinder is the earliest example of it.
@BrianSlater1976 @WilliamRBR @imgur I like Rollins, so it's not like you're rubbing anything in...
Rollins slowly got better on the mic. Reached a point where he could carry guys. Reigns...hasn't really improved in any regard.
Biggest difference between Rollins and Reigns? Consistent improvement.
@SammyJ_D Are you shitting me?
See what happens when you develop your promo skills?
@WilliamRBR @BrianSlater1976 at that time, he would have.
BSB is making a "Suplex City" shirt because we don't need WWE and copywrite hypocrisy.
@SammyJ_D ?
Big Show &gt; Seth Rollins, per Aubrey Sitterson.
According to Aubrey Shitterson, Seth Rollins sucks because he got cheered.
@WilliamRBR He looked real strong before the finish and commentary was trying really hard, for what that's worth.
@bradentstone DEAD
hey @WWE i will be entering ur diva search plz rt i cant w8 2 meet jhon cena #letsgocenacenasucks
So excited for Raw. Can't remember the last time I've felt like that. #WrestleMania
Also, I will be entering the 2015 Raw Diva Search, so plz RT.
Fantastic #WrestleMania
The guy who won the title at #WrestleMania...he's ready.
YOU COULD NOT HAVE ENDED THAT SHOW ANY BETTER #WrestleMania
SO MANY POSSIBILITIES #WrestleMania
BEST ENDING #WrestleMania
PERFECT ENDING
OH MY GOD #WrestleMania
OH FUCK #WrestleMania
Best falsey. #WrestleMania
FUCK YES! #WrestleMania
LOL #WrestleMania
OMG
This is silly #WrestleMania
Brock is such a babyface
BLOOD, ATTITUDE ERA, YEAH!
THE CROWD IS GETTING UPSET #WrestleMania
OH FUCK. THIS MIGHT GET UGLY. #WrestleMania
Is Roman Reigns ready? #WrestleMania
OHHHH REIGNS FUCKED UP LOL
Weak shit by Reigns right there.
"SUPLEX CITY, BITCH!" #WrestleMania
FUCK YES #WrestleMania
Wait, is Bray going to be the anti-Taker and go 0-21 at Wrestlemania before winning?
Ironically, Roman Reigns is a lot like fireworks during the day time. I still appreciate them, but I could do without them. #WresleMania
OHHHH FIREWORKS, I LIKE ROMAN REIGNS. #WrestleMania
@IDS616 We'll see. They don't have the best recent track record when it comes to people recovering from setbacks.
I'm honestly surprised that no sociopath has tried to stab Roman Reigns. #WrestleMania
Lesnar by murder plz #WrestleMania
@IDS616 I do, but I think this could've been a star-making performance and he's ready. So why set him back?
@IDS616 I get the "making you think he might lose" idea, but the damage is done. Now past his prime Taker beat Bray.
Brock and Roman gettin' that solid 6-8 match time, brother. #WrestleMania
EWWWW CHRIS JERICHO PODCAST NOOOOOO
Commentary is all about making the guys more over. Saying, "HE DOESN'T LOOK AS GOOD AS HE USED TO!" is accomplishing the opposite.
Also, JBL constantly saying, "HE'S NOT THE SAME MAGGLE!" doesn't do Bray ANY favors. Atrocious commentary from him.
Taker going over kind of defeats the purpose of the "GOTTA KEEP BRAY STRONG!" mentality. #WrestleMania
OH SHIT
I'm feelin' this now #WrestleMania
DA FUQ? #WrestleMania
Owen Hart took Snake Eyes WAY better than Bray Wyatt #WrestleMania
@RealChrisRoyale Lots of people still using traditional PPV for some reason, though.
Undertaker is pissed, because this was supposed to be the weekend he has his kid but Bray called him out and his ex-wife is upset.
@TylerMoliterno OH
@SugarDunkerton I've been back and forth on it all day. That's good work on their part.
We are like, REAL short on time.
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHIT HEADS JUST COUGHED ON MIC?!
I hope we get dejected husband Undertaker holding Michelle McCool's purse while she shops. #WrestleMania
.@danawhite I owe you one.
This would be so cool if it was dark out #WrestleMania

Women's M…
I NEED A LANTERN IN THE DAYLIGHT CUZ IM A FUCKING DUMMY #WrestleMania
Ronda Bless America. #WrestleMania
Let's undersell our female performers! #WrestleMania
Ronda Rousey is a fucking GOD. #WrestleMania
THIS IS SO BAD ASS #WrestleMania
THIS IS AMAZING #WrestleMania
Ronda plz. #WrestleMania
@TomBlargh IS THIS...REAL?
THE ROCK IS FROM EVERYWHERE #WrestleMania
@NMay11 That's my hope.
Spinner US Title coming back?
I've said for a long time that Cena shouldn't have been the guy to do it, but that was a fun match. Cena is great in-ring. #WrestleMania
@GPA_123 IF HE COULD WRESLE IT WUDDA BEEN A SHIRANUI BUT HE DOESNT NO SHIT
I'm expecting Cena to do Quack's Black Tornado Slam for the finish. #WrestleMania
But Cena can't wrestle LOL #WrestleMania
Rusev with the best diving headbutt since Owen Hart. #WrestleMania
Kristina's plan to get on screen during Mania next year: bring an "I'm an Erick Rowan Girl" sign.
"IF WOMEN WANT TO MAKE $1 FOR EVERY $1 A MAN MAKES MAYBE THEY SHOULD WORK AS HARD AS MEN WORK!" - Jerry Lawler
Jerry Lawler employing some great anti-immigrant logic. #WrestleMania
STAB HIM WITH THE FLAG! #WrestleMania
Pro wrestling is so fucking great.
Lana is the best.
SUPPORT THE TROOPS RAPADOO
I feel deceived by @WilliamRBR.
“@WilliamRBR: Alright, based on my inbox, clearly I'm missing a worthwhile show. I'll eat my crow and watch the rest. #WrestleMania” LIAR
George W. Bush, because tweener. #WrestleMania
"Hey a tractor! I'm from the country! America!" - Kristina
That entrance made me so happy. #WrestleMania
I LOVE PRO WRESTLING #WrestleMania
OH MY GOD. THIS IS AMAZING. #WrestleMania
Best entrance.
@TJHawke411 Yes, Big Show tossed him IIRC.
@TerrapinPrime @EricSBrady @RBRWrestling I get it, but I also do not care for Bryan Callen. I listen based on the guest.
@TerrapinPrime @EricSBrady @RBRWrestling :( That broke my heart.
@EricSBrady @TerrapinPrime @RBRWrestling I'm only 20/80 dude
I really want to see Bray/Taker
Hey, an AJ title feud has been set up. Fresh concept.
#DivasAreGivenEnoughOfAChanceIDoNotNeedToSeeMoreMatchesOfThisQuality
Really slow senton to the floor yeah! #WrestleMania
Nikki Bella is probably the WWE's best worker, regardless of gender.
Brie "Taking a Stupid Shit" Bella is the worst in the world.
Brie Bella covers her butt up on the twirl because Nikki's butt is far superior.
JK Nikki Bella is our generation's Randy Savage.
This following is match is a BATHROOM BREAK MATCH
@proudcaucasian "Hey this is fun, OH SHIT A BLACK GUY BOOO!!!!!!" - My timeline.
@JoeySplashwater It is not. She has a nice butt and looks like she probably has a gross, outdated STD such as chlamydia.
Is this for an entrance or nah? #WrestleMania
FUCK YES! #WrestleMania
I love crazy Ric Flair. #WrestleMania
"Wait, is this porn?" - Kristina on Too Hot For TV on #WWENetwork
I'm on board for Camp WWE.
Was it shit? Nah, it was alright. I don't get the logic of the NWO being there other than, "HEY, REMEMBER NOSTALGIA?!" It existed.
That was fine for what they are capable of, and they did a good job of popping the crowd, but I personally didn't enjoy it.
"Sting's gonna come back, and he's willing to job. Who should he put over?" 
"Triple H?"
"GREAT IDEA!"
Why did Sting come back to lose to Triple H? #WrestleMania
Perfect finishing sequence.
Orton is 1000% better as a babyface.
THAT WAS AWESOME. #WrestleMania
WWE doesn't have feuds or rivalries. No one hates each other. #WrestleMania
That was pretty!
I like how everyone is, "2004 ORTON!" rather than being like, "perhaps he was on a troubling amount of steroids for a while."
“@TJHawke411: This is a blood feud, right? I could tell by those intense side headlocks.” WWE doesn't have people hate each other any more.
Someone is cycling off. #WrestleMania
"Appreciate
What you've got 
While you've got it
So if it ever goes away
You can say you enjoyed it
While it lasted." 
Will Orton, as a babyface, use a prolonged chinlock?
JBL yelled out a fucking "Old McDonald" joke near the finish of a god damn #WrestleMania match. Fuck this commentary.
Excellent opener. #WrestleMania
JBL is the fucking worst. #WrestleMania
JEEEEEEEESUS! #WrestleMania #CZFUCKINW
Speaking of black cocks, look at R-Truth!
WSX BLING LADDER! #WrestleMania
@danlewis84 And I'm sadly intrigued to see which is the case.
"There's not like, a way he can be eliminated right away, right?" - Kristina on Daniel Bryan
@JoeySplashwater @TJHawke411 @SoDuTw He's a heel and you don't get it, NERD!
@TimWelcomed @TJHawke411 yeah u dumb fuckin mark
@SugarDunkerton Best of luck, and godspeed!
@JoeySplashwater @TJHawke411 @SoDuTw You mean "STRAIGHT SHOOT."
“@ItsBRob: @MaxwellRBR <REGISTERED SIGN>-Truth getting jumped, insert Sheamus” I'd be fine with that but it takes the only black guy on the main card off.
This match will be great, and every choice except for R-Truth is the right one. #WrestleMania
“@GPA_123: @MaxwellRBR Tomorrow would work since those crowds are white hot every year anyway.” They need a big Mizdow moment tomorrow.
@mrBacon16 @aubreysitterson @1stBloodPart2 LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
“@aubreysitterson: .@1stBloodPart2 GOOD! He's a HEEL! That's how this works!!!” LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL THEY AREN'T EVER GOING TO HIRE YOU PLZ STOP
“@danlewis84: @MaxwellRBR guess who's defending the decision as a good thing?” Aubrey Shitterson?!
Remember when they could have made Damien Sandow a star, and then they were like, "Nah." #WrestleMania
"Why do they always have the people that no one likes win?" - Kristina
Fucking SERIOUSLY? #WrestleMania
@ThatRobbieFox I'm sorry.
@OchoSports Just trying to grab food to go, but I swear I've seen six of the nastiest faces just for being here.
I feel like "Buffalo Wild Wings Waitress" is one of the bitchiest occupations.
Spending my Mania with a nasty sore throat :/
@TheBarrylad fucking ruined the show u dick
@WilliamRBR Is that the one where Tom Arnold is like, "my wife is fat lol"
hey is @WilliamRBR watching wrestle mania cuz he hasnt sed n e thing

@Nikki_Taylor2 Moderation is underrated.
@Nikki_Taylor2 They remind me of when a guy is going through puberty and tries to try on a suit from six months ago that doesn't fit now.
@bradentstone No idea
@TheMikeFrizz "He IS adorable!" - My wife's thoughts on that matter.
"Bad News Barrett, the sexiest man in WWE," - How my wife just started a sentence.
Really doesn't feel like Wrestlemania is today.
AR Fox is actually really insightful on commentary.
I can't believe Lanny Poffo is on his phone right now. What a disrespectful prick! #WWEHOF
"Macho Man wasn't only a great wrestler, he was also a terrible driver." - Hulk Hogan. So obscene. I'm offended. #WWEHOF
#Brand
@lob_3 Who?!
@chasitytaylorr BOOOO I DONT LIKE HOW THE WRITING TEAM USES YOU SO FUCK YOU ON AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR YOUR FAMILY BOOOO!!!!!
Leaning to the left to let out a little somethin' somethin'. 
Manu got mentioned by Rikishi in his #WWEHOF speech, what a fucking mark, everyone knows he's Roman Reigns now. #SHOOT #INTHEBIZ
@jeromepwpeditor I'm not watching, but that seems accurate.
When you're at your friend's house and you come back from the bathroom after being in there for way too long. 
@ThatRobbieFox Ask him why he blocked me :(
.@WasimPerviz You are a cunt #IDontFollowYouPleaseReturn #EatShit
Sounds like Kay Lee Ray killed it at #SHIMMER71 today. Come see her in Chicago at @FreelanceWres on 4/10!
UH OHHHH SOMEONE IS TIRED OF MY SHIT! 
@TheTylerVolz So hot!
@GeorgeGatton DEAR LORD
@GPA_123 @TheTylerVolz Gotta hang out with the wife today. Watching Gilmore Girls. What do you guys think of Luke Danes?
Richard Gilmore just had a heart attack...is this...REAL?!
@SherwoodStrauss @YourManDevine I spent three and a half hours playing video games on my wedding day. There's not much to be done.
Season seven of Gilmore Girls is so terrible.
@dEReK_DiReCTioN Those are my favorite ones, too.
@AnimeKing420 For real?
@theswainviour Is that a bread sandwich?
@Brother_Berk84 Claims positivity but shits on his "haters" and calls them butt hurt nerds. So positive!
Aubrey Sitterson is also the one fan who somehow went out to eat with the boys after a show and everyone is ignoring him.
Aubrey Sitterson is your friend's ugly shitty friend that invited himself to tag along to lunch with your friend.
@TheBarrylad pfft, i dont no n e of them
@TheEliSteele She's really athletic, so if she came from the same background maybe she could, but no.
Great work day. Weekend should be a blast. Life is great.
Rousey likes Pokemon and wrestling and is hot, but my wife likes those things, looks like her, and has a superior butt, so it's whatever.
@scottkurupter Hahaha, I appreciate it!
@MMARoasted He doesn't bump, so he will never be knocked down. He's going to HAVE to win the title.
@theswainviour I GOT THE COMMIE PART AND I KNOW WAYNE ROMNEY IS A FOOTIE.
@Mike_Hall11 HAHAHAHA I GOT YOU, YOU STUPID FUCK AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
@scottkurupter You WILL be disappointed.
@Mike_Hall11 He gets cancer and dies first #TheFaultInOurStars
@theswainviour IS THIS POLITICAL OR FOOTIE (I HEAR THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL IT)?!
@Cooooooooooper_ Agreed.
One follower away from 700. Plz RT to get me one more follower and I promise I'll be less terrible at tweets.
"Sure! But I'm not Delirious."
"Oh."
*walks away in disgust*
@RealDaveRoberts Damn, you're right.
And you're like, "you don't need to subject yourself to this" but your friend's all, "nah man, it's whatever."
Like, "this sucks, but a blowie is a blowie, and Wrestlemania is Wrestlemania."
@jeromepwpeditor Nope.
NAAM SAYIN?
This year's Wrestlemania is the fat chick at the bar that approaches your friend and tells him she's going to suck his dick.
@TheBarrylad You were your own kid?
@danlewis84 DEAD
I'M POSITIVE! EVERYTHING IS GOOD! You disagree? You're a morally inferior person and a nerd. I'M POSITIVE!
Aubrey Sitterson seems like the worst type of person.
@CutToTheChaseT Uncle NOAH brings the goods.
@SammyJ_D @jeromepwpeditor I know someone working in that area who said the local draws are usually pretty strong. We'll see.
FUN FACT: the cause of death on the autopsy of Jimmy Snuka's girlfriend was listed as "protecting the biz."
@SirCalBaldwin GRILL, BRUH.
I burnt the shit out of some green beans last night but I told my wife to enjoy them for what they are because I'm in the biz.
@WillDangerZone &lt;3
Roman Reigns needs the turtle sandbox TitanTron.
Now whenever I see someone I don't want to see, Roman Reigns' entrance music starts playing in my head.
SALES TIP: When there is a lull in the conversation, ask, "wanna talk about CM Punk?"
Kristina said Ryback reminds her of The Big Show. I am so disappointed in her.
@AnonymousRawGM @WasimPerviz @themattgalloway @PaulGriffin
@theswainviour This Dave guy sure is bad or whatever.
@Mike_Hall11 MAAAAAAN GEICO SUCKS.
@Mike_Hall11 hit me up for cheaper insurance bruh. Then you can have LOTS of Doritos.
@AngelusLayne bruh I've been cast free since 2001 but I'm also lazy and a commentator so that doesn't really mean anything.
@BDenny411 Same
@Jacoblee27 NBA2K is my jam.
M-1 Knight Fighting is exactly what MMA needs to establish it's legitimacy and move the sport into the mainstream.
May end up having my best month ever.
@EmilySUPERMARIO Thank you!
@EmilySUPERMARIO I've never done a "jump" wake up until tonight. Woke up muh wife n shit.
Just had a dream that someone snuck into our apartment while we were home, which was a little FUCKING TERRIFYING.
@nickmaniwa AGREED! And he's always like, "this guest host is our best one yet!"
@lob_3 The best show.
vignette 4 romin rains original gimmick the apex sexual predator was gonna feud w ortin. 
East playoff "chase" 
@jeromepwpeditor Eh, it's very early to say that.
@NotThatTomGreen Hopefully. Still waiting for an official answer.
.@TheReedBentley is a tough son of a bitch. Can't wait to commentate for him for the first time in way too long at @UGWrestlingCom on 4/11.
@WilliamRBR @kingmoctezuma2 We went long?
@kingmoctezuma2 Ask @WilliamRBR
Booze fruit this weekend? Yes plz.
@Marty_McFly44 Have you no class?! You're supposed to seductively bite your bottom lip while pointing at your crotch.
@lob_3 I'M A CLUB DOUCHE FROM 2007 MAGGLE!
"Brick" came on at work because songs about abortion make me SELL, baby!
Dragging serious ass today but got something on the board.
@JustShillinglaw You sweetie pie, you!
@TheTylerVolz @RBRWrestling FUCK YOU!
I had a blast on @RBRWrestling 500 last night. I hope you all had fun too.
@aestheticstevie thnx
@BDenny411 The show handle is @RBRWrestling.
@BDenny411 I didn't say anything about that.
@TheHunterAAK It's a template joke. Always starts and ends the same, you just make up the middle. Check the wiki page "The Aristocrats."
#TheAristocrats
God, we won't have anything to discuss on @RBRWrestling tonight.

@daz_gun @RBRWrestling Yes!

Call: 909-581-4727
@SirCalBaldwin I most definitely will be.
@SirCalBaldwin Yes, that is me, haha. I tend to talk more professionally on commentary. That's how I talk at work, too. I'm chillin' on RBR.
It is written. #TheAristocrats
.@RBRWrestling Episode 500 tonight...#TheAristocrats
He also wanted to check out multiple times due to "limit one per customer" restrictions.
HE WAS UPSET THAT THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT EXPIRED COUPONS.
What a cocksucker.
He just walked out and left all of his shit on the counter...OH MY GOD.
Only one check out open, trying to buy diet coke, stuck behind this asshole who is contesting everything.
Extreme couponers are the worst of the worst.

…
@FightOwensFight @Cbmaddox82 Randy Orton's do and I'll show myself out I apologize okay bye
@aiwrestling Excellent show title/poster combo.
@HECochrane That isn't talked about enough. Very odd.
@HECochrane You guys have a gift...NOW WASTE IT!
“@PaulGriffin: @MaxwellRBR @wwefan4lifxx @KonyChimel Then what were you doing on the stage with Renee Young tonight!?” THAT IS MEAN.
I was actually never in any special classes, surprisingly enough.
@HECochrane FEEL BAD. NIKKI IS THE KIM JUNG-UN OF AMERICA AND WE ALL MUST SHOW HER RESPECT
“@wwefan4lifxx: @MaxwellRBR @KonyChimel and you are a male eugene. oh wait.” I WAS ONLY IN TWO SPECIAL CLASSES DUE TO A CLERICAL ERROR!
“@HECochrane: @MaxwellRBR An old run-down drunk who was never that good?” OH THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE THERE ARE KIDS HERE
But on the Gilmore Girls front, CHRISTOPHER IS THE DIRT WORST!!!!!
Nikki Bella is female Ric Flair. That is all.
DID LORELAI AND CHRISTOPHER GET MARRIED?! DAMN IT, NO!
@GPA_123 I POPPED HUGE FOR THAT TWEET.
.@thewadekeller Eat a dick.
@TomBlargh Would you say that he's more like...Aubrey SHITterson?! #FUCKPG
Today was rough. I feel like death.
Despite a layover in America's skid mark (Detroit), I am alive.
Just landed in the armpit of America, Detroit, due to being low on fuel. Thanks, Southwest Airlines.
@ThatRobbieFox Flight got delayed :(
Velocity &gt; NXT
UPDATE: Wade Keller is still a silly bitch.
@TheBarrylad YOU GUYS CALL IT DRINK-DRIVING?! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I have to be up in six hours. Oof.
@jeromepwpeditor DID HE PAY FOR ROH SEMINARS?! BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU GOOD.
wen u look in the mirror n uz like i look bad 
@jeromepwpeditor He's stupid good.
@jeromepwpeditor Kicks kicks kicks kicks kicks HEY AN ARMBAR FOR NO REASON!
@jeromepwpeditor Now they just need to replace Romero.
I mean, I don't have a shoot job, I pay my bills as a commentator. #ProtectTheBiz
Off work tomorrow, traveling in super early. Going to sleep and play Pokemon all day like a champion.
It sucks, but that's why they are giving you the information. That's why they let you feel like you are "a part of the team."
If you report on anything, the fact is, anyone giving you the information thinks you are an easily manipulated mark.
@NotThatTomGreen I GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD BRUH
@NMay11 I should've listened to Max Landis more obvi
Wrestling Is Gross
Some promotions use writers/reporters/columnists as puppets. Some guys leak stuff to be held in good favor. It's gross.
Wrestling politics are very silly and run much deeper than you would believe.
Some promoters don't like the idea of a guy getting over on their own. They want to take credit. So they inadvertently avoid unique talents.
There are some really unique talents on the indies that I think some promoters are honestly intimidated guy. They want it to be THEIR guy.
@PaulGriffin @RealDaveRoberts @TheBarrylad Technically I WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT MY THEORY THAT FRENCH FRIES ARE SHIT BABABOUEY
"You wanna hug me?
What rhymes with hug me?
Man, my wife left me."
- Robin Thicke, sobbing to himself on the shitter.
They also agreed to make the "I'm kind of switching which foot I'm stepping on and almost shaking my hips" their most prevalent move.
When was the summit where all white girls decided to only do the same four dance moves?
@PlanetX1 Place is p good. Strong drinks. Get bison.
@TheTylerVolz But srsly probably Eddie Guerrero and Shawn Michaels, even though I'm pretty sure that's never happened, based on versatility.
@TheTylerVolz Low Ki and Dixie.
Just so you know, they view you as a shit-head, kiss-ass mark who doesn't get it.
I LIKE TRIPLE H TRIPLE H IS GOOD HE GETS IT JORB PLZ.
The amount of internet wrestling personalities trying so hard and shamelessly to get hired by WWE is pathetic.
“@aubreysitterson: How come nobody in WWE has that "all about dat ass" gimmick right now?” Because that idea fucking sucks.
wut is vlog 
*Wins by opponent escaping submission hold and referee being an idiot*
*elbows opponent in the head and taunts him*
There's never been a better time to re-think your Hep C.
Ingrid Michaelson is actually p cute. Never knew that.
“@PaulGriffin: @MaxwellRBR dick is literally in his name” Dick In Son. Maybe he knows Wade Keller.
Dickinson is a #worker u marks
@bellegenerico Yeah, I just feel bad for his family. His home life hasn't been the same since he became an alcoholic.
Has Wade Keller given any explanation for his sensationalist bullshit yet?
@PaulGriffin They aren't good.
@ThatRobbieFox @kelsierotert FUCK OFF
.@PaulGriffin WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING?!
If I were an EWR promotion, I'd be at war with:
-Wade Keller
-French fries
-Chicken Selects
.@kelsierotert Chicken selects are fucking terrible and that's a God damn shoot!
#WadeKellerIsAScummyBitch
@lob_3 He's such a piece of shit, and he won't even supply an answer for those questioning his obscene actions.
ICYMI: Wade Keller is a scummy bitch.
That's a Jack Daniels with in-house honey and ginger ale.
Booze4Days 
@smvrobles I fucking lost it over this.
March Madness makes me miss college basketball video games BIG TIME.
@ThatRobbieFox @themattgalloway AMAZING
Wade Keller is also blocking people who favorited/RT'd my question. What a splendid guy. Trying hard to avoid all criticism.
@DonaldFThurin I asked when he would fix his incorrect report about Perro's death.
At least Wade Keller addressed these concerns with class and dignity. JKLOL.
Wade Keller is the biggest sack of shit- that's what I learned today.
The answer, by the way- NO, he will not fix his incorrect report regarding the death of a human being. 
Shows me right for trying to show respect to a dead guy!
LOL 
.@thewadekeller Want to stop RTing praise about yourself and correct your incorrect report about someone's death?
@StepDaddyFinnin Probably because white people can't "have" brothers any more, you racist.
I love the art of pro wrestling, but I honestly hate a chunk of the reporters and fans. Very upsetting.
This tragedy has brought out the worst in some fans and sensationalist wrestling "media" websites.
@TJHawke411 @DylanWaco @voiceswrestling Gross
"WRESTLING ISN'T FAKE BECAUSE A GUY IS DEAD SO YOU SHOULD LIKE WRESTLING NOW!" - People's actual reaction to the death of a human being.
@HeatherAG2112 @TheMikeFrizz I don't think that should be the focal point here. A family lost someone today.
Wrestling fans using a guy's death to be like, "SEE HOW NOT FAKE IT IS!" are the worst kind of people.
The whole Perro thing really has me shaken, still. It's a reminder as to how dangerous wrestling is.
It's a giant metal thing that holds a shitload of people and it's supposed to fly?!
Just getting on board as I realize how terrifying the concept of an airplane is.
@SpikeEskin B-b-but---ROOKIE OF THE YEAR! LOTS OF POINTS! SIXERS TRYING TO LOSE ON PURPOSE!
Sixers win percentage is .454
Bucks win percentage is .363
@GeorgeGatton NO WAY! That rules.
@GeorgeGatton "WHERE IS EVERYONE?! I THOUGHT CALL TIME WAS FOUR!" - Me at 1:30
@GeorgeGatton I always wake up begrudgingly early the day of shows, and then get there stupid early.
@GeorgeGatton Why are you up?!
Hoping I can sleep on the plane.
I just realized it's 7:19 AM on a God damn Saturday
Touching penis prevented another great American tragedy from happening today. Way to go, TSA.
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING METAL BY YOUR KNEES LET ME TOUCH YOUR PENIS
TSA all up in my butt
Gotta be up at 5 tomorrow...OOF.
I can be easily deceived
if you want that
I need the silence, I need the empty streets
Just as bad as they don't need me
.@RBRWrestling's 500th Episode...#TheAristocrats.
Just found someone a way to save $100+/yr and they chose NOT TO DO IT. Despite the fact that it would COST THEM NOTHING AND SAVE THEM MONEY.
EEEEEEARLY flight tomorrow. Blegh.
Here's some advice for you guys with a Kickstarter...*smirks* GO FUND YOURSELF!
@celfiesta FUCK MY RENT MONEY, THIS CD WILL GET MADE.
@JoeySplashwater "Cool Dad" Chris Jericho is the dirt worst.
I initially followed him because I heard his twitter sucked.
I finally unfollowed Ezekiel Jackson on twitter. No idea why it took me so long.
Here are Kate Upton's boobs in a hot tub- download our unrelated app.
@SugarDunkerton That may be IndiesWrestler's finest work yet.
"WHEN I LOOK AROUND THE WRASSLERS LOCKER ROOM THESE DAYS ALL I SEE R A BUNCHA MARKS AFRAID TO USE THE OTHER F-WORD." - Jim Ross, eventually.
@TheTylerVolz You better not pull a Shane Douglas and come back in two hours, then correct yourself saying you meant to call it "THE SHIT."
ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THEIR OH MY GOD THIS SONG IS ABOUT COLUMBINE SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
I've got a p good joke lined up for @RBRWrestling's 500th episode. It's a new spin on an old classic.
If Brock retains at Mania, WWE neeeeeeeds to get him one of the UFC "AND STILL" shirts to put on afterward.
Paid poop vacation
Eat a turd nugget, you dickbags.
@StepDaddyFinnin Not a fan of socialism?
.@TheBarrylad will still make me a Barrylad Club Guy, whether he wants to or not! 
Controversial opinion: fries are terrible.
@lob_3 Unfortunately I think that match lead to the popularity/overuse of finisher-bukkake match endings on the indie level.
@lob_3 I was there live. Amazing.
Chasyn Rance tried to ruin Best Friends w/ Teddy Hart like it was an underage girl's orifice.
“@PlayerTypeZero: @MaxwellRBR When are you coming back to RBR?” I will never leave @RBRWrestling again.
@r_wachter @PaulGriffin GET ON IT!!!!
Classic prank: kick your friend in the nards. Then tell him it's just a prank.
Plz buy my new pro wrestling tees shirt "I'm A Guy."
@NotThatTomGreen He wants to know how to not get locked out of his website.
I'm getting some big opportunities soon. P excited.
@PKolehouse OMG I LOVE THE FRONT BOTTOMS!!!!!!
@GeorgeSuchy i made tens a dollars so i no a lot bout da biz
@GeorgeSuchy u jus don get it

.@WasimPerviz stole the poster he is claiming to be his from @PaulGriffin. Plz note that Wasim is a piece of shit.
@lob_3 What is this rule?
@jeromepwpeditor No!
The end of The Jinx...
I wish my wife like sushi more, you guys.
Jimmy Jacobs has signed with WWE in a creative capacity. Word is that he looks forward to starting a heel stable.
I'ma get on this TV, momma
I'ma, I'ma break shit down
Fuck You. 
Uh oh, Dido is crazy. Poor Luke :(
Watched Best Friends w/ Teddy Hart. Shame the pedophile kept butting in and included himself in the picture. He put a damper on so much.
I quite like Dido's music.
I like this storyline with Luke and Dido, I think.
@EmilySUPERMARIO It just hit me that I literally picture you as a human being with a gigantic Mario head.
@EmilySUPERMARIO Season six was fantastic, I thought. Kristina likes Logan, further proving that she has terrible taste in men.
@EmilySUPERMARIO fuuuuuuck. My wife likes this season some how.
@EmilySUPERMARIO I'm five episodes into season seven and I'm hating it. Am I crazy or nah? Does it get better?
REMEMBER THE PEOPLE YOU HATED?! YOU SHOULD LIKE THEM NOW!
So far I hate season seven of Gilmore Girls. Absolutely terrible.
wen d-lo wants to do a powerbomb spot 
JK it's beets.
My favorite vegetable is broccoli and my least favorite vegetable is Droz.
@TomBlargh Oh, too REAL for you?
Also, way too many promotions bitching about a lack of fan support. Fuck off. Make the fans support you by having a product they want to see
Telling people you're a relevant indie promotion doesn't make you a relevant indie promotion.
1) The superkick/sunset flip bomb combo onto the ramp in the opener
2) @smvrobles' sc…
Joanna Jedrzejczyk is one of my favorite fighters now. SO likeable.
Just watched the UFC fights from last night. Very sad to see Pettis lose, but very glad to see Esparza lose.
@RobIMatter @MattKnicks1 I'm disgusted.
Kids these days, you guys.
.@MattKnicks1 sent me a snapchat from when he was three feet away from me. I can hear myself talking to @aestheticstevie in the background!
It was a pleasure working w/ @NotThatTomGreen at @UGWrestlingCom tonight. Such a professional, and so easy to work with.
@kelsierotert Jk it's flat and my wife makes fun of me for it.
@kelsierotert I always have a good ass day.
MAIN-EVENT TIME! Valentino challenges Mojo McQueen for the @UGWrestlingCom Championship!
April 11th...Jesus Bryce vs. Eric Priest?! @UGWrestlingCom
Brendan Conway is stupid good for how few matches he's had. Keep an eye on him. @UGWrestlingCom
Chris Cairo with a successful return to @UGWrestlingCom! Great to have him back!
Mike Matthews' Frog Splash is ri-GOD-DAMN-diculous. @UGWrestlingCom
Hell of an @UGWrestlingCom debut for D'Angelo Steele!
I blew my "DANGEROUUUUUUS!" on the opener, that's how good it was. SUNSET BOMB ONTO THE RAMP!!! @UGWrestlingCom
FANTASTIC opening contest at @UGWrestlingCom between The Curse and Rey Furia/Haunter strange!
IT'S TIME! @UGWrestlingCom
Was Lennay Kekua a babyface or a heel?
POLL: Are all white people privileged?
@WilliamRBR @ThatDudeBruh @RBRWrestling @DeathToAllMarks 
Whenever I'm having a bad day, I think of @themattgalloway saying, "YOU FORGOT YOUR STRAW!"
dick pic 
@theTomRichards Nothing worse than guys trying to get themselves over when they don't bring in any $ and damaging the product in the process
@theTomRichards Cool. Thanks man! I owe it all to my broadcasting partners: @ZackBraxton, @K_Mel91, and alcohol.
@theTomRichards I was on play-by-play. Please feel free to throw any thoughts on the commentary to me- always looking to improve.

Neck beards are starting young…
Just won a game of Star Wars Trouble because I'm a fucking champion. 
Love when people who bitch about a certain thing try to create that same thing.
Six years ago today, Test drowned in a pizza. #RIPTest #PunisherAndrewMartin #DiGiorno #DeepDish #TestOfStrength #PizzaFace #SAD
BUT DAT AINT MY BIDNESS THO
There's a special place in hell for people who say something to someone's face, and then do the opposite behind their back.
@Cooooooooooper_ @gelaaa05 STAHP HITTING ON MUH WIFE ITS LIKE SOPHOMORE YEAR ALL OVER AGAIN
I hope Jedrzejczyk wrecks Esparza, who found a way to immediately become my least favorite champion in the UFC.
@gelaaa05 Making out with Kristina and eating chicken wings, but I would completely understand if that's not your cup of tea.

MeanGirlsYouCantSitWithUs.gif
@gelaaa05 I disagree but I respect your opinion.
@jeromepwpeditor Master of Arts...is that the one where a guy blasts a woman in the head with a chair?
Don't treat me like a woman!
Don't treat me like a man!
99.9% sure I'll be attending Wrestlemania next year.
Tomorrow I get to commentate @ugwrestlingcom w/ @NotThatTomGreen and podcast w/ @GPA_123 and Brendan Conway. Should be a great time!
@CEO_253 Mine are too
Buzzfeed is Jericho. 
@kford13 I was really concerned.
@kford13 I thought I somehow missed out on something even weirder.
@arikcannon @abbeypub @FreelanceWres I'll talk about you drinking PBR and punching faces as it happens!
@kford13 WAIT, THIS HAPPENED? Not at Back to Basics, but last year?
@BrianMaxMann You think the internet loves him NOW, wait 'til he kills his family!
Terry, I'm not booked.
I'm not booked, Terry.
@jeromepwpeditor Yes, and it's also terrible.
Kristina has decided to name our future cat (and also our firstborn son), "Corporate Kane."
@SugarDunkerton @jeromepwpeditor @ZackBraxton @beyondwrestling &lt;3
@newfoundmass What an interesting week for a restaurant.
@voiceswrestling @SammyJ_D That's certainly how some people feel about it.
@inrogers29 You are of great help, good sir.
.@PaulGriffin IS A TURD 
@inrogers29 Thanks for the recommendations, dude!
@NotThatTomGreen @ZackBraxton @jeromepwpeditor OH THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
@inrogers29 None yet. Probably getting Pokemon X and Y.
@voiceswrestling @SammyJ_D It's not a war, IMO. Just two different companies. Thanks for the feedback!
@SammyJ_D @voiceswrestling I will be comfortably seated.
#TBT to my previous life 
@SammyJ_D @voiceswrestling Yup, same day.
@jeromepwpeditor @ZackBraxton @beyondwrestling I don't see anyone pissing but you, honestly.
@jeromepwpeditor @ZackBraxton @beyondwrestling So why is this "why you don't run against AAW," then?
LOL at people who want other indies to fail in the name of "business." This isn't a business. It's a hobby. #20DollarPaydays
@ZackBraxton @beyondwrestling @jeromepwpeditor Exactly. Why can't we all be happy and successful? Not always a competition.
@beyondwrestling @jeromepwpeditor Two different audiences, honestly. Only one side views it as a "rivalry."
I DO NOT LIKE CHRISTOPHER. #GilmoreGirls
Reminds me of my favorite promotion in 2002, WWE Smackdown.
It's basically the same as saying, "My favorite promotion is WWE Main Event."
Any time I hear someone refer to NXT as "the number two promotion" I start to vomit but choke it back down (not unlike Crash Holly).
Big E is on WrestleMania promotional material.
The phrase, "hand jibber" will never not be funny.
Last two days have been loooooooong
Gawker has an article about Lavender Town Syndrome! @MarkusCrane learnded me about that!
.@RBRWrestling is planning for an alternative scenario for the post-Wrestlemania episode in case @WilliamRBR does resubscribe.
There has been speculation that @williamrbr is going to subscribe to the WWE Network again.
