"Once we put fossil fuels in the rear view mirror, we are never going back."-@bruneski #powershift #cleanenergyfuture
"In the last decade the price of wind has dropped 90%."-@bruneski #powershift
"The price of solar panels have dropped 80% in the last three years." -@bruneski #powershift
"Why should we wait for a distant clean energy future when we can have a prosperous clean energy present." -@bruneski #powershift
"Talking about an #alloftheabove energy strategy ignores the reality of climate change."-@david_turnbull #powershift 
@david_turnbull on @BarackObama's #alloftheabove energy strategy to wreck planet. #ThePlan can save it #powershift 
We're tabling at #powershift! Come find us and learn more about #ThePlan for a clean energy future.
75% of global #ghg emissions come from 17 Annex 1 countries. These developed countries must lead #climate efforts. #powershift
"We don't believe it's good jobs or a clean environment. We believe it's both, or neither." -Leo Gerard #powershift 
"Why put unregulated fracking chemicals in the ground when we can have a clean future?"-Deb Thomas. #theplan has u covered, Deb. #powershift
#Pittsburgh has a vision for a clean energy future. #ThePlan can take this vision nationwide. #powershift

@EliasHinckley Only way 2 change politics is 2 keep raising voices. W/ #climate, we can't accept half-measures. Must call for bold solutions
@EliasHinckley Politics never been tougher, neither have stakes. Must put pressure on Congress, but #ThePlan has administrative components 2

It's time to move #BeyondGas and start investing in long term energy solutions. Find out how @ 
@CleanTechies Economics aren't there. Can't rely on #CCS in the short term. Need renewables to come online now. Find out how w/ #ThePlan
@Poweroverenergy @NREL estimates that if US had 80% renewables for electricity, water consumption would decrease by 50%
Norway scraps #CCS bc of economics, yet @BarackObama's plans rely on it. US must invest in proven climate solutions 
@EEPublishing @MikeSoraghan No mention of #climate impacts in this discussion. Esp. impt. b/c #methane leakage greater for exports.
A good piece on how we are #ExportingEmissions to other countries, and how #BigCoal is banking on it. 
On Friday, we were on the air discussing #ThePlan w/@KBOO in #Portland! Here's the show. Our segment begins @ 9:30 
@jendlouhyhc @BreakingEnergy by time #CCS commercial, #renewables will be cheaper. CCS will add $.05/kwh to price of #natgas
We have a blog! Check out our first post by @lichtashio: 
@NRCgov to shutdown midweek. Lack of oversight in uncertain times highlights risks &amp; why we can't rely on #nuclear 
This fall, 10,000+ youth leaders will converge in Pittsburgh, PA to fight for our future. Join us at #PowerShift 2013 
@Gasteluj Budget illustrates the problem, but it is not a solution. The policies put forward in #ThePlan can help realize necessary cuts.
Global #carbon budget explained w/Legos. #ThePlan provides a path forward to stay within budget. 
While US emissions falling, US oil production &gt; Saudi Arabia. #ThePlan will ensure emissions go down @ home &amp; abroad.

There may be a #governmentshutdown, but that won't stop #climate change. Still need to focus on policy solutions.
Catastrophic warming only avoidable w/ "radical" cuts according to @IPCC_CH. 17% below 2005 levels won't do the trick. Time for #theplan.
@GinaEPA relying on #fracking won't slow #climatechange, even w/ new EPA regs 
#CCS is risky and not yet commercial despite what @GinaEPA says, but #renewables are mature and ready for deployment now
@GinaEPA just admitted that states don't always comply with #CAA regs. We need policy tool that is infallible. We need #ThePlan
@GinaEPA CCS worldwide can only provide 14% of reductions needed to #ActOnClimate according to @IEA. Let's push 4 real solutions w/ #theplan
Then why are we just fulfilling legal obligations under #CAA? MT @SierraClubLive: @GinaEPA "We must have the courage to #ActOnClimate"
@GinaEPA says new power plant standards impt part of @BarackObama's plan to #ActOnClimate, but we need stronger action now. We need #ThePlan
@EPARegion8 @GinaEPA Leading the world requires stronger signals to cut carbon pollution, like those in #theplan #ActOnClimate
@NRDCFedGov A good start, but @BarackObama can do more. If we really want to #ActOnClimate, act on #theplan
