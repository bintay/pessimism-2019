@LeahNTorres YES!!!! Thank You! Pro-Choice is Pro-Child.
@emmyrossum That's what I tell my daughter, too. She is the greatest gift life has given me. I am very grateful today!

@LeahNTorres SO TRUE!!!! I have many mothers who never gave birth (at least not physically).

@skottk @elonjames  I'm agreeing with you. Blacks are pathologized/ whites are not. Violent crime is highest in poor urban WHITE areas.
@skottk @elonjames We don't work overtime to pathologize whiteness.
@elonjames The violent crime rate of poor urban whites is slightly higher than that of poor urban blacks. Bureau of Justice stats.

@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Well, thanks for being respectful. Again, perhaps black people will read your tweets and learn from you.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams I'm glad you don't want to pull safety nets.That's a start.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Well, maybe black people will read your tweets and learn to improve themselves.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams How should we punish single parent families?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams So should we start to punish broken homes? Would that help?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow I'm interested in what the black community has to say about this. Surely they are the experts, not you.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams And how should single moms be punished for those decisions, or supported in recovering from them?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams Oh really? Have you conducted a poll?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams Especially now that abortion/bc access has been restricted by Repubs.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams How is being a single parent a decision? Most women do not become single parents by choice.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So agreeing with the black community on the source of their pain is "bigoted sympathy"?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams I'm unwilling to celebrate good decisions? Example please.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow And criminal justice reform.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow By help I mean living wages, universal health care, affordable housing, increased funding for education.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Why do you think that is? Because they're too "dumb" to know any better?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So, regardless of what the black community believes, you think blacks create their own oppression.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow How do you know?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Why would your mom need a handicapped pass for the family car anyway? I assume she didn't drive.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So you do support changes from DC and state governments to help the poor.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Isn't that a little, um - racist?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So black people support dems because they don't understand their situation as well as you do?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow No. Just mis-informed.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow But did she/does she support government assistance for those less fortunate than she was?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So she would have accepted government assistance if she weren't fortunate enough to have help.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Who do they claim the racists are? If it's "liberals" then why are over 95% of black people Democrats?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Does your mother, who was financially supported, condemn blind people who need assistance?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow That's because your dad was supporting her. Would she have let you starve if he didn't?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Is this what members of the black community say? Or do you know better than they do what hurts them?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Also - have you asked many members of the black community "whose" bigotry causes racial disparity?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So whose bigotry has caused the racial wealth gap in this country?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow And you still haven't told me how your blind single mom supported 5 kids.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Who promises them that? How are they promised that?How do we stop "promising" them that?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow As I said - we'll agree to disagree. You still haven't shared how your blind single mom supported 5 kids.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow What if they do love their kids desperately? What if it isn't their fault?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Shouldn't we celebrate your "broken home"? It sounds pretty wonderful based on what you wrote.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Whose culture are you referring to? Come on!
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So your single parent family worked for you! See!How did mom support you?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow I think its white people who have been robbed of accountability.We have the power/we are accountable.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow By whom?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow As I said, we will have to agree to disagree. Our values and life experience are too far apart.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow  I was a low-income single mom and I wish I'd had more "bigoted sympathy" coming my way.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Perhaps we'll just have to agree to disagree.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Perhaps it's access to resources, not family structure, that determines a child's well-being.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Do you think the child from a 2 parent family in App is better off than the child of a wealthy single mom?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Who called you an enemy? Do you disagree with my statement? Why/why not?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow We are the community. It is our collective responsibility to support children -especially poor children.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow In general, it's best for children to be wanted, loved, and supported by their communities.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Perhaps the problem comes from my unwillingness to generalize. Life is more complicated than that.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow The child of a two-parent family in Appalachia will not do as well as the child of a wealthy single mom.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow It depends on how wealthy the parents are, what their resources are. The answer is yes/no.
 
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow How much does that usually cost? Do you know? What percentage of "third world poor" make it here?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow How are they taught that? Who teaches them? Who is/isn't investing in them?
@reluctantzealot I wasn't rude. I just called you out.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Most "poor" children do not have several generations able to invest in them.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So it took several generations to get ONE child here. How are all the children who were left behind doing?
@reluctantzealot @LauraNo You won't tell me because you are lying.
@reluctantzealot @LauraNo What county do you live in?
@reluctantzealot @LauraNo They REFUSE?? Where's your evidence of this?
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow So how did they get here? Did they swim?Or did they already have family resources waiting in the US.
@DHT1977 Yep. Lots of broken homes among the wealthy, and they are EXTREMELY dependent on tax breaks and corporate welfare. And slave labor.
@nyamentikeely Yes! Another way to help poor children is to relieve all the crushing economic stress on their parents.
@DHT1977 @divatudenj Respectfully? And stop with the code words. You are talking about Black Americans. Own it.
@divatudenj Because single moms (like I was) are easy scapegoats. We're stressed, broke, and can't easily fight back.
@reluctantzealot @LauraNo Refuse? So, poor communities don't pay "extra taxes" because they "refuse" to be wealthy? Madness.
@LauraNo YES! We need to EQUALLY divide resources for schools. EQUALLY!!!!
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow Again, poor kids may be able to get here from Mexico, but NOT from across the ocean. Think.
@DHT1977 @ProfKCWilliams @MHPshow If they managed to save the 5 figures necessary to relocate their families to the USA, they were NOT poor.

@DreamyBritter I haven't had freshly caught fish since I was a little girl. I remember how delicious it was, though!
@DreamyBritter I don't blame you. Do you &amp; your mom ever catch fish and eat them?


@DreamyBritter Good! But you never know. People eat all kinds of weird things.
@DreamyBritter Oh gross! Did she throw it back?
@DreamyBritter I love seals! I like walking to the peer near my home to look at sea lions. So cute!
@DreamyBritter That sounds wonderful. And you don't have to worry about sharks on land!
@DreamyBritter It sounds like you live in a good place for hiking and camping, though.
@DreamyBritter We have to drive a long way away to find a beach warm enough to swim at. Northern CA beaches are freezing.
@DreamyBritter They are in SF, too. It's way too cold to swim here.
@DreamyBritter If you love the state you're in you might as well stay there. It's nice to have a home base.
@DreamyBritter I heard it's very green there, too. Very pretty.
@DreamyBritter It's funny because I live in SF and complain that it is usually too cold here. There's just no pleasing me.
@DreamyBritter True! Nothing feels better than just the right amount of warm sun - but not the kind that roasts you!
@jojokejohn She unfriended me first!
@DreamyBritter It was! Except at night. The nights were cooler, but I never wanted to be outside in the daytime. All that sunlight wasted!
@profblmkelley True. I was just being silly.
@DreamyBritter When I lived in Tucson it would be over 110 degrees for months! That was definitely too hot!
@profblmkelley I think "jerk" is the right word to use.
@DreamyBritter I'm glad it's hot there, then! Hot sunny weather is the best. But not AZ hot. That's TOO hot.
@DreamyBritter That makes sense. When I lived in AZ I often wanted to sleep on the cool tiles instead of in bed.So hot!
@DreamyBritter Yeah! You'd think they would like the bed better than the floor!

@Marin_1412 @FemSpa @gigagiga333 Missy? And yes, presenting a white supremacist view of the world as "fact" is claiming superiority. Own it.
@OldDeadTree @ChuckCJohnson The business owners who give him a discount and not her are discriminating based on race.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 And what is a coal burner?
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 So, you're saying white people are superior to other races.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 Um, yes there are slaves in the USA. We just call it human trafficking these days.
@FemSpa I'm a woman, so I can't be a cuckold. Also - the Nazi's were white. Very very white.
@gigagiga333 @FemSpa If it's a people thing, why don't you stand up against the oppression of other races? They're people, too.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 WE WERE THE NAZI'S!!!!! Are you being satirical or are you a teenager?
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 Also - no. China is not the biggest polluter. The USA's carbon footprint is BIGGER and our population is smaller.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 Nope. Wrong. Whites had slaves as early as any other races, but we spread it further.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 Yes, one could argue it was evil. That little Holocaust thing was pretty evil, too.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 A Jew invented the bomb, but it was USED by white Christians, who were also busy committing genocide against the Jews.
@LorddyLordd @gigagiga333 Really? What did you learn in school about white people?
@Cwheezee @gigagiga333 Many cultures have had slaves, but only whites based slavery on race and made the trade global.
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 We were also the 1st to use nuclear weapons, commit germ warfare, and commit global environmental destruction.#superior
@FemSpa @gigagiga333 We were the 1st to make slavery about race and to make it a vast global trade.
@gigagiga333 We didn't create it, we just mastered it. Especially in America.
@ChuckCJohnson Gosh, how nice to support the people who discriminate against your wife. Maybe she shouldn't have kids with you.
@ChuckCJohnson No discount for her! And what about other interracial families?

@rios_conradrios @VidaUrbonas The same people he'll be giving discounts to are the ones who demand "English Only" laws. Great move.
@VidaUrbonas Of course that's the goal. How's it working?
@AngryBlackLady @Mwangangi @9NEWS Perhaps this is a trap for racists, and he's going to give everyone food poisoning that day.
@deep_beige I hope every white person who goes there that day gets food poisoning (hey, maybe that's the plan).
@totalpkg1969 @tariqnasheed @USATODAY That's his motivation. White immigrants from Europe embraced racism to be accepted as white.
@tariqnasheed He must have read the book "How The Irish Became White." Answer? By attacking the black community.

@Fengaz @musicchasers Again - thank you for making yourself so clear. I can't imagine why any woman or black man wouldn't like you.
@Fengaz @musicchasers Thank You, Dude, for making yourself and your world view so clear.
@Fengaz @musicchasers I don't understand you. I don't have the animosity toward men that you have toward women - or black people.
@Fengaz @musicchasers How do you feel about the Black Lives Matter movement.
@Fengaz @musicchasers He's a very strong man, and a very loved man. Also - do black activists hate you, too? Or just feminist activists?
@Fengaz @musicchasers Your personal experience is extremely limited. I also suspect you are very young. You hurt yourself by judging women.
@Fengaz @musicchasers My husband is a man, a feminist, and has only been hated by female Pro-Lifers. You know: anti-feminists.
@Fengaz @musicchasers I'm a woman who adores her (male) husband and (male) mentors. You are biased against feminists and blind to reality.

#بحزاني #بعشيقة <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@musicchasers @Fengaz You and the dude need to get out more. Neither of you have met an actual feminist - male or female.
@musicchasers @Fengaz The most man-hating women I've ever met were anti-feminists. They tend to have very low opinions of men.
@Fengaz I'm a feminist and some of my greatest HEROES have been men - including my husband. Don't stereotype.
@wildwonderweb @AtheistinAA @afamhistfail lots of great sites online, too!
@AtheistinAA @wildwonderweb @afamhistfail True! And sometimes not even then!

@JaupiAsllan @8theistkidbooks Yeah - and "black lives matter" is racist.
@8theistkidbooks @JaupiAsllan It's extremely threatening to weak men.

@GamerGateSF @JamesBolton11 No one wants to date Beyonce? Taylor Swift? I'm happily married and so are most of the feminists I know.
@GamerGateSF That was probably because you threatened to rape and murder her dog.

@DutchyMDHC You mean American Indians?
@DutchyMDHC What's an "American American"?
I'm afraid we're going to do to Muslim Americans what we did to Japanese Americans during WWII. So many are hated for the crimes of a few.
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty You are a hate-filled racist, the kind who has been destroying this country since its founding. BLOCKED.
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty You want the stats for that, too? White people are NOT BETTER than black people in ANY way.

Flowers amongst ancient olive trees 
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty And I wonder what the incest and domestic violence rates are in those "good" white appalachian communities.
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty 
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty Poor urban blacks (51.3 per 1,000) had rates of violence similar to poor urban whites (56.4 per 1,000).
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty Word press? That's a BLOG!
@Mercurial891 @ConversationEDU @DrMeaganTyler We probably agree on more than we disagree. It really is not my place to define other people.

@optinion1 @unemployedfatty White on white crime is a serious problem - and white men murder a higher % of women than black men do.
@optinion1 @unemployedfatty Poor whites have a HIGHER violent crime rate than poor blacks. Where's the outcry about that?
@unemployedfatty Internalized oppression? That's all I can think of. He reminds me of women who make excuses for rapists &amp; wife beaters.

@unemployedfatty Perhaps he's afraid of his own suppressed rage. Very sad.
@TheAngryFangirl Excellent points - and I'm not even a choice feminist. But maybe I am. Made me think...
@Mercurial891 @ConversationEDU @DrMeaganTyler That's the whole point. You don't have to call yourself a feminist. If you're not, you're not.
@unemployedfatty @DerayConscience Freddie Gray broke his own spine, black people enslaved themselves, and global warming is a lie. America!
@Mercurial891 @ConversationEDU @DrMeaganTyler That's your choice.

@pamihami Only Christians have used nuclear weapons. Christians enslaved millions of people. Genocide, global warming - all Christians.
@pamihami Yes - Christians commit every atrocity known to human kind. We slaughter people in other countries daily. Every single day.
@pamihami It was Christian missionaries who got a "kill the gays" bill passed in Uganda, and Christians are oppressing women in the USA.
@pamihami When you say "their" to whom are you referring? My muslim neighbors do not do those things - but many Christians do.
@pamihami So we agree that you cannot judge Islam by the actions of two sick people. Islam is as valid a religion as any other.Right?
@pamihami Yes. Only two. To blame millions of innocent people for the actions of two is obscene. And bigoted. And ignorant.
@AmyMek @alomarelaf Many of my neighbors are muslim. Mothers, fathers, children - wonderful loving people. They fear people like you.
@AmyMek What do you mean we should "wake up"? How? By hating all muslims for the actions of a few? Should we hate all police, too? Ignorance
@ensignbay @NumbersMuncher I'm outraged, but not at all muslims. That would be ignorant and unfair.
@NumbersMuncher The young woman in the photo is a muslim. Is she a "savage" too? Be careful who you hate - and why.
