Sometimes the best thing to do is just say nothing
A discussion about race should be discussed by adults who can maintain their levels of emotional involvement. Too touchy of a subject
I value a well worded, educated, formatted opposing argument even if I don't agree. But if you sound like a dipshit, you won't be heard
HAHAHAHAHA I am the definition of a loser
"Would you be interested in a really tall, funny, guy whose kind of an asshole and has a lazy eye?"

Weird that ppl are so quick to believe that girls are only insecure about what we look like but that's not even half of it
Forever wishing that guys had more of an interest in me, not what kind of sexual favors I have to offer #tbfh

Girls are talking about pizza &amp; Netflix for relationship goals, then here I am like; where's my Louboutinis and Valentino evening gown?
