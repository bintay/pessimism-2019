I HATE BEING SICK
I love this song but I feel like the artwork is so obviously a girl sucking a dick?? 
Gina gets me sick all the time but when I'm sick she won't come near me
I just want someone to sit &amp; watch netflix with me without being afraid of getting sick. I've had such little contact with my frans :(
I'm so lonely &amp; they wouldn't even stay :(
Roth &amp; Marie came over and all they did was stand in the corner of my room and treat me like a leper.
when Kristine wants to start playin tho 
like I thought I was sleeping this whole time but I was really just staring at a wall
moving to the part of the fever where I'm cold but really hot and I'm so hot that I'm just really confused<SKULL>
Kristine brings me sweets when I'm sick. She's the love of my life.<HEART WITH ARROW>
if I don't get a milkshake soon I'm going to have an emotional break down
everytime I move I get goosebumps<FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
somebody run my errands for me :(
I didn't realize how sick I was until I stood up and felt like a knife had been stabbed through my head
@Li___lo she made me feel insecure without even trying
@Li___lo yes I'm going to direct you to her IG so you can see how unfair life is
one time she had a bday party but didn't invite any of her friends, just her sisters high school friends and we ALL CAME. She was like 8.
I was looking at her insta &amp; thinking back to when she was younger &amp; she has honestly always been in style &amp; better than the whole 209
One of my best friends little sister has literally been cute her entire life. She never had to go through any awkward stage. It's not fair.
I wanna drown my sorrows in a milkshake, or better yet shoot myself.
wow I hate being home
when your side hoe catches too many feelings 
"I like your style" he says, as I look down at my jeans &amp; nike flip flops

".....thank you"

&amp; then her sister told me about her dead bunny, restyled my hair, &amp; then offered me some of her candy. It was beautiful, I love kids.
last night I let a random 4 year old child use my phone and she posted to my snapchat story. I don't even know her name, she just sat by me.

He has like $400 worth of coins and I'm over here breaking a sweat.

Shelby looks so cute driving her car around<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
the embarrassing part though is that a Disney On Ice show is Ticketmaster's top pick for me.
"presented by ... Iggy Azalea!" 
It is also why I just spent half an hour wrapping Gina's gift that is an abnormal size. Can't throw something like that into a bag.
I think the best presents are the ones that are actually wrapped, which is why you will never see me throw a gift into a bag on Christmas<WRAPPED PRESENT>
@shebalebb13 if they even have it<WEARY FACE>
@shebalebb13 true, congratulations Shebby!<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><TWO HEARTS>

@AlexxB07 woah I bet you get all the daddies
@AlexxB07 your sarcasm is greatly missed Alex. but if you do have a tumblr lemme get your username. is it strawberryfrappsforever?
and then later condescending themselves because they don't know what the hell they "believe"
tumblr would be great if more of its users formed their own opinions instead of conforming to popular opinion
@kristine_kanari @_haleygraham_ she's too pretty to be hated, I'm sorry Kristine.<SLEEPY FACE>

@GollyMsLolly that is EXACTLY my luck<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
It all happened so fast I couldn't even think of a good lie. I just slapped the passenger seat &amp; said "don't look at it but hand it to me"<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><BROKEN HEART>
First I laughed then I saw which receipt it was &amp; my eyes got huge &amp; I gasped. She saw the name of the store &amp; was like, "This is mine huh?"
Tell my why the receipt to Gina's Christmas gift fell onto the floor of my car &amp; got stuck to THE BOTTOM OF GINA'S SHOE. I hate my life.
@_kelsseyy did Lemony Snicket write series of unfortunate events about you?

I somehow have to get my brother to try on a shirt without seeing it so I can see if I have to return his gift too. damn.

@PurpleLeafSteez @Arbys disgusting
Like she really said that the girls that Bill Cosby allegedly raped were asking for it. Trash.
I think I'm actually going to fall asleep before 1 tonight and I am amazed.
As much as people hate Iggy Azalea, she always does brush it off in the classiest way whenever someone talks about her. Makes me like her.
@yungferb ya I feel like he will but I don't see why more versions keep comin out, I think the Christopher Nolan ones will always b the best
@yungferb nobody's gonna like his performance cause they'll automatically compare it to Heath Ledger's which can't be topped lol

-Odd last name.
-Several good seasons on previous team.
-Four years in Atlanta.
-Decent money.

Wait, tha…

I feel like Selena Gomez is that friend that hates hanging out w/ Lorde, but tolerates it b/c she's friends w/ Taylor Swift.
too much to do right now :(
tonight just seems like a good night to fall asleep while watching Kick Ass or Dark Knight Rises
We witnessed a hit &amp; run like half an hour ago &amp; the guy pulled 30 feet away, got out, checked his car, and then sped off. Drunk ass.
wow couldn't have come to this conclusion without Gina's advice 
I don't think I could physically handle meeting Kristen Stewart. I'd probably just die from my own mortification for whatever reason.
I'll know I wanna marry someone when I realize I want to do things for them that I don't even do for myself.
Luli couldn't give 2 fucks about personal space 
Humidity is the breath of the devil.
There's a Grumpy Cat Christmas special on tomorrow &amp; Aubrey Plaza is voicing Grumpy Cat. To say the least, I'm very excited.
