One time I snuck an Alice in Wonderland phone case on C's phone while he was asleep &amp; hid his regular case so he had to take it to work <SMILING FACE WITH HALO><SMILING FACE WITH HALO><SMILING FACE WITH HALO><SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
I got a new phone case today but nothing will ever be cuter than my Snow White phone case.
@I_TheeWed @DisneyFiancee She's asleep because she didn't sleep at all the last couple nights! Lol. I'm missing her too
I've decided I'm definitely gonna use the new Insta account to post my makeup collection, so whoever asked for that it's coming!
First post is a #picslip <WINKING FACE> I'm so excited to start this Insta! I can't wait to share more of my life‚Ä¶ 
Okay guys! I made an Insta for this account so I can share more pictures of my life with you! It's BridezillaLife, go follow! <SMILING FACE WITH HALO><TWO HEARTS><YELLOW HEART>

@anonwifelife Lmao, that's my main goal in life <WINKING FACE>

Also he hates when I call him beebs so obviously I call him that 24/7 <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
Celebration dinner with beebs for my successful first day!
Walked into my first day of work and was told that I'm making $1.75 more an hour than I thought so...yeah, it's been a good day. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª
@ohiowife_mommy SAME. Like girl. What is wrong with you lol
@ohiowife_mommy That's actually really sad. Her real life must be pathetic.
@ohiowife_mommy Omg! I can't believe that! That stuff makes NO sense to me
@ohiowife_mommy So was she just lying about everything or what was the deal?
@ohiowife_mommy WHAAAAAT
@HappilyEvAft I didn't either. Don't feel bad. Lol
I'm so excited/nervous for tomorrow that I can't sleep.
@I_TheeWed I'm dying. Find more asap
Oh I forgot to post outfit options but I figured it out and will post it all put together tomorrow! FIRST DAY OF WORK CANT WAIT
@mrsbrattywife I always miss all the good stuff.
@ohiowife_mommy If you find anything out you better let me know lol
@ohiowife_mommy Everyone's talking about it and I'm so upset I missed it! Lol
WHAT CATFISH INFO DID I MISS SOMEONE FILL ME IN
@FierceAndLittle okay because I almost had an effing heart attack
@FierceAndLittle You promise?!
@FierceAndLittle Oh. Cool <UNAMUSED FACE>
@SpoiledGFProbz NEED
@The_Chic_Mom I wonder how I could start?! I think it would be fun to free lance.
@The_Chic_Mom Like plan a brides wedding and then do her makeup lol
But it was awesome that she thought I had that semblance of talent, right? Right. Okay. Crisis over. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª
So now my life is like up in the air. But not really because I'm not gonna be a makeup artist &amp; I've worked too hard to just drop weddings.
And that made me think. Like I love weddings and I'm passionate about that too, but do I love doing makeup more? I DONT KNOW.
So then my older cousin who lives in NY was telling me that I should go take makeup classes and REALLY learn how to do it, as a profession.
It might make me sound effing crazy, but I get so passionate about makeup. Like showing my cousin how to BLEND her eyeshadow gave me life.
I saw a lot of family I hadn't seen in forever this weekend, and we got to have a mini 'makeup pro tips' lesson.
Does anyone use and recommend the #clarisonic? #replytweet
Prepare yourself for pictures of outfits to help me choose what to wear tomorrow for my first day. GOTTA LOOK LIKE PERFECTION.
After a very emotionally draining weekend, I'm ready to be home and get ready for my first day of work tomorrow!
My only motto in life is 'don't lose'
Gran's viewing and funeral today. <BLUE HEART>
@mrsbrattywife I take mine off for sleeping, showering, lotion, everything.
@waywardfiancee How did you do this?! It's absolutely adorable!
Why did I laugh so fucking hard at this  
Juicy Fruit Cherry Starburst gum is giving me LIFE right now
WHY AM I CONSTANTLY LEAVING THE HOUSE WITHOUT A BRA ON
Packing for myself is hard, packing for myself and fianc√© is basically impossible.
@MyWifeyLifey What is this?!
OMFG MY LIFE IS COMPLETE YAAAAAS 
I got my nails done at a new place yesterday and I hate them <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
Like, what do you need to rest for? So you have the energy to leave me?
Not to‚Ä¶

I'm still not over Ned Stark. #GameofThrones
I'm a lot more sad than I expected to be leaving here, but I'm ready for my new adventure!
I was supposed to start my new job tomorrow, but with my grandmother's passing, I'll be starting on Monday.
Today is my last day at the hotel!
@MarriedStudent Just out of curiosity, why do you feel that way?
@_SpoiledGirl Nap. Always nap.
@MarriedSouthern I worked at Hallmark for a few years! Loved it. Good luck!
Also I REALLY want my wedding dress back from the alterations place. It shouldn't take this long to fix an effing zipper give me a break
Which is probably because she doesn't even KNOW details because she's a stupid idiot slacker.
Probably doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's a big deal to me. And she doesn't answer my texts about anything, so I can't get details.
can't even go because that's the weekend of my bach party and I'm NOT changing that for her. So...I'm just seriously irritated today.
Plus she's just super fucking rude and I hate her, and this just adds on top of it. I can't stand her. PLUS if her wedding is the 17th, I
everything. I'm not gonna wait until the last minute for her and then spend money I'm saving for MY wedding on a suit for him. Nope. No. No.
AFTER THAT. That's gonna be an crazy busy time for us, so we need to know details. Now. Especially if we need to budget in for his tux and
getting his tux, her colors, where the ceremony even is. And she's acting like it's not big deal. NO BITCH. I'M GETTING MARRIED 3 WEEKS
She hasn't decided yet. THAT'S ONLY 5 MONTHS AWAY. C literally knows NOTHING about what he's supposed to do for her wedding. Where he's
C is supposed to be in the bridal party for one his "best friends" named Lauren (who I hate by the way). Her wedding is either Oct 10 or 17
Okay, about to vent.
They say everything happens for a reason.
@Anon_Paparazzi She's @ SASSYANDSPOILED now
My grandmother passed this afternoon, prayers would be appreciated.
@AdoreMyMan @ThatWittyWife I wanted a mashed potato bar SO BAD
@AdoreMyMan it'll be cheaper that way too
@AdoreMyMan Absolutely! Pick one or two 'main' food stations, and then put the sides out.
@AdoreMyMan Mac and Cheese! Corn on the cob, beans, always do a salad, fruits.
FUCK I'M SO FUCKED
@jackieproblems What do you do to detox?
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
MY ULTA PACKAGE IS GONNA COME TODAY PRAISE YOU LORD
I truly cannot pick my wedding invitations. Someone do it for me.
Does Taco Bell really have free tacos today? Asking for a friend....aka my fiance.
@sparksandcake Money has been a difficult challenge. And I've had some bridesmaid issues, keeping everyone in check attitude wise.
@DisneyFiancee Let me know, I'll beat them up for you.
@DisneyFiancee Oh God I would have lost it
@LifeLoveWine No, not okay. Who would want that anyways?
@LifeLoveWine My maid of honor planned the whole thing, and she just told everyone to wear black.
@LifeLoveWine Like you're being required to buy a new dress for the bach?
I have an idea for one but I just don't knowwwwwwww
SOMEONE HELP ME FIGURE OUT THE PERFECT FIRST DAY AT YOUR NEW OFFICE JOB OUTFIT
@DisneyFiancee 
Yesterday while I was putting on my makeup I got distracted and only put eyeliner on one eye. Today I realized I forgot to put concealer on.
@DisneyFiancee At least now we can keep each other occupied at the same time, instead of me making you stay up until like 11pm lol
@DisneyFiancee Nope! 8-5 Sun-Thurs :) Which is PERFECT considering my weddings are always Fri-Sat. So it really is the perfect opportunity.
@DisneyFiancee I'll be a CSA at a major oil and propane distribution company. And of course my coordinating on the side. I'll be a busy bee!
@DisneyFiancee YAAAAAASSSSSS. I start tomorrow! Random day to start, but whatever. lol.
@MrsStudent1 You would THINK she'd be like "Oh my word my baby can't breathe &amp; is up earlier than normal, let me be sympathetic &amp; loving"
I can't wait to be out of here tomorrow. Goodbye, piece of shit coworker, I look forward to never seeing you again!
@MrsStudent1 I really hate parents who post stuff like this.
I'm fucking LIVID and it's barely 7:30. Gonna be a great day.
@LypstickJungle YES. So much yes.
My excuse was always 'I don't have good shoes to work out' so....these came today. Lol. 
Actually obsessed with this.  
Crab rangoons, diet coke, and stalking #MetGala2015 fashion. This is the life.
Ew no what the fuck this is all so bad  
I LOVE Twitter when something is happening fashion-wise. I get all the info and photos right at my fingers. Fucking technology, man.
Also Miley Cyrus is hideous okay bye #MetGala
I don't care what anyone says- I fucking love Amal Clooney with everything in me.
@LifeOfAMrs story. of. my. life.
@TheSpoiledWife I always think this too! I wanna get mail lol
We officially (and finally) moved out of our first apartment today! Kinda sad, kinda happy to be out of that shit hole. Onwards and upwards!
Won this shirt in a bar contest in college in 2010. Ya girl was classy back in the day. #drinkdrankdrunk <SMILING FACE WITH HALO> 
I love this so much  
@SimpleWife_ Same! So in love with it.
The only thing getting me through cleaning the last of the apartment today is knowing I have two packages coming today! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
YAAAAAAASSSSSSSS 
@CapeCodClass I know! I hate to even wear dresses because I'm tan everywhere else but my legs are pasty lol
Already stressing about what to wear on my first day of work at my new job. Which isn't until Thursday <UNAMUSED FACE>
@CapeCodClass My legs literally NEVER tan unless I'm applying self tanner. The sun or the beds don't work for me.
@wifetobe2017 Already got it, doll!
@wifetobe2017 ME ME ME ME
@ThatWittyWife @ClassiestMisses We have Belk in Virginia!
@AdoreMyMan I literally copy and pasted a picture from when we got engaged into word, and put our names and date underneath <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> not special.

#RoyalBaby had the best May 2nd of all time.
Any of you who suffer with acne but are into makeup need to check out @mypaleskinblog on YouTube. She's amazing!
I want avocado eggrolls from Cheesecake Factory.
@DisneyFiancee You'll be tan soon though!
@DisneyFiancee Whatever works. I'm basically the palest person alive.
@TheMrsZilla I'm gonna need pictures/updates/videos k thanks
@AdoreMyMan Exactly. He always says "I just thought we had more time" like no bitch, you have 188 days to man up lol
@AdoreMyMan C said he thought he was gonna throw up in the jewelery store yesterday buying his wedding band. Normal.
@TheMrsZilla I'M JEALOUS AS FUCK. He's literally my favorite.
@NowEngagedLife Yeah, so ever since then I'm crazy about it. lol.
@NowEngagedLife That happened once, like the day after I got it. I had the hotel staff come in and move the bed out. lmao.
@TypicalWifey Stove! It will melt it more evenly, plus it'll smell amazing.
@NowEngagedLife I take it off even for hand sanitizer lol. I'm just a little anal about it. Whatever. lol.
@NowEngagedLife I kept my ring box&amp; store it in there at night/showers/putting lotions on, etc. I'm neurotic about keeping it clean, really.
@NowEngagedLife Do you sleep with it? When I first got mine I had to take it off at night, I would scratch my face in my sleep with it lol
Because that's me today.
You ever wake up and think "Today I'm gonna learn how to get healthy and be the best wife ever and cook well and do EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD"
I NEED A COFFEE. This green tea thing I've been trying out is NOT working for me. I'm a coffee girl and I'll always be.
@JulyBride2016 Happy wife, happy life!
@JulyBride2016 And he probably never will. But as long as he doesn't go, you win. And that's what matters. lol.
@JulyBride2016 Good for you! You're about to be married- no more sleeping over with other girls. Boys can be so dumb. lol.
But he found his perfect ring yesterday &amp; they were having an amazing sale so we got it. So that should be interesting when she finds out.
But instead of her wanting him to be happy, she just wants what she wants. It's so annoying. And it puts him in an awkward situation.
C's mom is gonna freak that we bought his wedding band yesterday <UNAMUSED FACE> She wants him to wear a family ring that he hates.
@JulyBride2016 They can't pick him up/vice versa? That's not a good enough excuse, I'm sorry. There's no way I'd be comfortable with that
@wifetobe2017 @LifeOfAMrs families are different religions, so we just decided to take it out of left field. lol.
@wifetobe2017 @LifeOfAMrs We're getting married in a Methodist church! We didn't want to have a "baptist" or "lutheran" wedding because our
@JulyBride2016 Is he insane?! How would he feel if you just decided to go sleepover with a bunch of guys?!
@bmbshllbrntt @keepit_chic well now I'm starving so thanks lol.
@JulyBride2016 nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
@LifeOfAMrs comfortable with.

@bmbshllbrntt @keepit_chic That sounds amazing ahhhmazing
I went to leave for work this morning &amp; I kissed C on the cheek while he was sleeping and it left the perfect little lipstick mark. So cute.
Waiting on 4 packages to be shipped and I am DYING hurry up
Woke up singing "Goodbye Toby" from The Office so it's gonna be a great day.
@TheHotNanny The best part of being an adult is doing whatever the fuck I wanna do <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª

@JulyBride2016 Nope. Nope. I'm all for trusting your man, but you can't trust girls nowadays! Shut that shit down!

@TheNewYorkDoll Okay! Didn't know if you'd think it was weird or not lol
@MarriedStudent It was worth it later that day lol
@MarriedStudent engagement ring, so he just had to let me pout the whole time lmao
@MarriedStudent Then when I asked him what he was doing and he was being so shady, I got SO mad. Of course he couldn't tell me it was my
@MarriedStudent ring would go off in the metal detector <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I was so mad at him! Lol

@TheNewYorkDoll You've been on mine for like 2 weeks <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@SC_Wife I just got a really simple one. I'm not really a jewelry girl, so it's pretty plain and pretty.
@MarriedStudent Oh and coffee. Actually just caffeine in general. If I could have a caffeine IV that I wheeled around all day I would.
@SC_Wife Check Etsy! That's where I got mine and it was like $20 and SO cute.
@MarriedStudent MAKEUP. Brushing my teeth lol. Planners/organizers. My pillow pet. Disney Princesses. Basically I'm 5 whatevs. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª
I have to have Family Guy on in the background or I can't fall asleep. Ever. C says it makes me giggle in my sleep lol

@Lipstik_Queen I love Est√©e Lauder DoubleWear! Are the Chanel Hydrating products worth it?
I feel like I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight because I'm getting my ring cleaned tomorrow for the first time and I'm just SO EXCITED <RING>
@mrsbrattywife The lemon raspberry cheesecake is what I want to eat everyday in Heaven.
@Lipstik_Queen Your skin is 100%! What products do you use?
WHY WOULD SOMEONE ASK ME TO DO A MAKEUP POST LIKE IM NOT REALLY SURE HOW YOU WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. JUST COME OVER AND LOOK AT IT. SHIT.
Oh shit that reminds me I still have to figure out a way to do that makeup post. Should I just do pictures of what I have?

@TheTexanVixen Mine are coming back within 10 days.
@TheTexanVixen I've never seen a contract that holds photos for that long! The longest I've personally seen for a bride is a month.
@TheTexanVixen omg that is SO annoying!
Told C I was 1 follower away from an even number &amp; that he should follow me. He says "I don't wanna see all the shit you say about me" lmao
@OneHousewife13 Worst feeling ever.
One of our staff made me an iced coffee this morning without me asking. Either she's nice or I look like shit. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª 
Happy Friday! Drink your coffee, wear your smile, and get shit done! &lt;3
@TheTexanVixen Why do you have to wait like that?!
Pro Tip: Wear the brightest lipstick you can find in order to distract people from the disgusting bags under your eyes.
I never claimed to be a good cook. Now give me an Excel spreadsheet, and I'll make some magic. In the kitchen...not so much.
Literally almost burnt the house down trying to make French toast so C is making grilled cheese. I'm sure he's so excited to get married <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
I could watch "This is Where I Leave You" a million times and never be sick of it. Tina Fey &amp; Jason Bateman are everything.
French Toast for dinner, then Redbox movies for the rest of the night. I love the nights where C and I can both be home together. Best ever.
Paying my rent on time every month is such a satisfying feeling to me. Adulting is real.
Just had a mini spending spree at @ULTA_Beauty but I mean...I had points. So that's budgeting, right?
I'm really hoping this new reception venue works out because it is absolutely PERFECT for what I want!
@AdoreMyMan I do that ALL the time. Or my own phone number. I look so dumb. lol.
I actually loved this. lol. 
@almostwifelife You're doing a lot better than so many people. Look at the positives!
@DisneyFiancee THEY NEVER LISTEN
@DisneyFiancee Because I want it to be long and I'm scared she's gonna chop it all off.
@DisneyFiancee I'M SCARED NOW
Now that my hair appointment is scheduled I'm freaking out that she's gonna chop it all off. FREAKING. OUT.
@DisneyFiancee You will be happy to know that I scheduled my hair appointment for Saturday!
I'm getting my ring cleaned for the first time on Saturday! 
@unengagedug @Wifed_First Same!
I'm thankful for a job that let me resign without making my life a living hell. People shouldn't be punished for bettering themselves!
I actually really wanna see the new Mad Max movie. Tom Hardy is on the top of my to do list.
I NEED THE ROYAL BABY HERE NOW.
I wanna get one of those bathing suits that look like the Little Mermaid for the honeymoon. Am 12.
@TheTexanVixen Ob-freaking-sessed with this
Just trying to load the dishwasher and I look in and see this. Nice <OK HAND SIGN>üèº 
Money is the reason we exist. Everybody knows it, it's a fact. Kiss kiss <KISS MARK>
@TheSpoiledWife I just can't find anything that I like enough to spend substantial money on. So I'll just get a nice pedi &amp; rock bare feet
If my dress covers my feet, can i go bare foot to my own wedding? I can't find any shoes I like.
@DisneyFiancee I MISSED YOU. and no I didn't because I freaking forgot AGAIN. I'm gonna make an alert on my phone for tomorrow. lol.
@DisneyFiancee are you at the melting pot again?!
Haven't talked to @DisneyFiancee today and I'm genuinely concerned. WHERE ARE YOU FRIEND ARE YOU OKAY
@AdoreMyMan They're perfect! Especially if you're not trying to show off your hips, aka why I have about 10. lol. Rock it girl!
@AdoreMyMan I personally think you'd look perfect in a peplum dress!
@AdoreMyMan That's what I thought! But my dress turned out perfectly.
@_italiaprncess LOVE that Nyx lipstick
@wifetobe2017 OMG I'm totally showing C this! He doesn't believe that guys wear engagement rings!
Currently working on finding a new venue so let the stress begin.
I WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT MY RINGS ON I FEEL NAKED RIGHT NOW
@LilMiss_Prozac Ah! Amazing. Thank you!
@LifeOfAMrs LOVE the monogram.
@LilMiss_Prozac Let me seeee. I'm a planner addict.
I NEED MY HAIR TO BE LONGER. WHY ISNT IT GROWING.
@DisneyFiancee I HAVE to remember to do it tomorrow! I can't believe I put it off this long.
My main goal at my new job: have the cutest desk out of anyone there. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª #powerbrunette
@DisneyFiancee Literally just remembered I never made a hair appointment <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> I suck at being a girl.
We have a name picked out for our future pets, but not our future children so...that's where we're at.
The breeder we're trying to get a corgi from will have his next litter available in 4 months, but we won't be ready by then <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@coffeemomma_ Omg I'm in love with her! She is such a doll!
@AdoreMyMan Yes! It's just my first and last name together, no space
@AdoreMyMan I have SO many of these pinned for our forever home!
@AdoreMyMan What is this?! Lol
I think I might actually cry right now. So upset with my wedding venue <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@SimpleSpouse Thinking of you!
@I_TheeWed Im thinking of taking two weeks. Wednesday before to the Wednesday when we get back from the honeymoon.
How long is/did you guys take off in the days before your wedding? I don't know how many to tell me new employer I want off b
And now I've learned that I don't just get teary eyed when the song I'm walking down the aisle to comes on- I absolutely sob. Cool.
@_SarahPresley 'You are the Best Thing' by Ray LaMontage
I love when our first dance comes on my shuffle. I get so excited and a little teary eyed. I just can't wait to be married.
@IndianaWifeLife You absolutely can! Already being married won't effect it. I'm a coordinator, and have a wedding planner for my event.
I feel like I can tackle all my projects better and more efficiently with a new mani. So to the salon I go.
My hip just popped so loudly my dad heard it from the other room. K.
Gonna get my mom a gift card to the nail salon so she can get her nails/toes done before her and daddy go to Florida <TWO HEARTS><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è
@TheSpoiledWife Ew that's annoying! My best friend named her daughter Olivia and I loved that name. lol.
@TheSpoiledWife True! But idgaf, I love it. lol.
@TheSpoiledWife We only have girls names picked! Harper, Sophia, Brooke, and a few others.
People who take an elevator that has an 'out of order' sign on it must have a fucking death wish.
@treschicbarbie That was my main concern, peoples SO's feeling out of place if they didn't know the people they're sitting with.
@treschicbarbie I love that idea! I never even thought of that! Thanks for the idea, doll!
Girls that complain about the size of their engagment/wedding/promise rings make me sick.
@treschicbarbie Did they have all the bridal party at one separate table? Or did they mix them up between tables?
We're considering not having a head table, anyone else just have a sweetheart table?
I don't care if that makes me selfish because that bitch needed to get her own ideas lol
So to the public it looks like I haven't pinned wedding stuff in like 9 months but really I'm just keeping all the good ideas for myself.
I have my wedding Pinterest board on private because this bitch I used to go to church with started stealing all my pins and I got mad.
The power surged at the hotel this morning and this lady in the lobby screamed SO loud. It was absolutely hysterical.
No matter what, our next place has to have an extra guest room that I can use for getting ready. I am not into sharing my makeup space.
I have an awesome picture of him that shows how weird he is but I think that would be too mean. ...I might do it anyways though idk
Today's wedding coordinator project: Confirm with the fireworks guy. I HATE THIS GUY. Seriously such a creep.
Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is never far.
That 4 hour nap last night really fucked me because then I couldn't fall asleep again until like 4 and I got back up at 5:30 so I'm dead
I eat my pizza with garlic sauce, ranch, and marinara. Fucking fat ass over here and I couldn't even care any less.
@bridezilla_life CC: @TheNewYorkDoll
All my corporate/office girls...where's the best place to shop for nice but comfy dress clothes for work? I wear a uniform at the hotel.

@DisneyFiancee Don't be. My fat ass isn't gonna fit in my wedding dress.
@DisneyFiancee Okay you twisted my arm I'll get pizza
@DisneyFiancee Pizza Hut box?
Help us figure out what to eat for dinner. Best suggestion wins.
@AdoreMyMan @DisneyFiancee FIND ME IM ON HER FRIENDS LIST
@iQueenTweets Love it! Would be perfect as a new avi <TWO HEARTS>
Just took a 4 hour nap with C on accident. Missed dinner reservations and our movie. Totally worth it.
If anyone ever finds me on FB, feel free to add me! I love new friends <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><TWO HEARTS>
@SoFlaGrlProbz I've had an iPhone for 4 years and I've never once seen this! What happened?
@MarriedSouthern Not currently, but I want to start! It's so expensive to go get them done.
There's a lady doing psychic readings at the hotel right now and I need everyone to tell me not to spend my money on it.
First Jamberry mani! Just on my ring finger, the rest are gels. But I LOVE it. It's so adorable! 
Just tried Jamberry for the first time, and I'm kind of obsessed.
@TheLadyBoss_ When you have the whole day to get ready before you go out, it seriously is so fun. lol.
@SweetheartWife Power of prayer, doll!
@TheNewYorkDoll Purposefully late to work this morning in order to get one. Whatevs.
@DisneyFiancee He ruins everything. lol.
@DisneyFiancee Whenever I mention I name C says "That reminds me of this, that sounds like that, remember that person we knew named that?"
@TheLadyBoss_ Those are seriously the best days.
@GoldPeak GREEN TEA IS THE BEST THING IN EXISTENCE AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE YOU'RE DUMB. Okay you're not dumb but seriously this shit is good.
@TheLadyBoss_ Oh he definitely won't be single long. lol.
@TheLadyBoss_ I guess he was just rude and grumpy and mean all the time. So they were like "done with your shit. pulling the plug"
@DisneyFiancee I mean it wouldn't be my first choice but at the rate we're going, we don't have a lot of options. lol.
@TheLadyBoss_ I read that too! I saw that he was like, full of attitude and BS because of his home life so they killed him off. lol.
I'm just really excited to start my new job and start moving forward with wedding planning and making more money and to get married.
@DisneyFiancee Probably just end up with a C Jr. lmao
@SimpleWife_ We just can't agree! I don't even have a lot that I like, I have like two. I'll have to get a book and look for one. lol.
C and I agree on so many girl names, but if we have a boy we're screwed.
There's a vendor day at the hotel today and I think I just signed my life away to Mary Kay. No idea what just happened.
@SweetheartWife You're fine doll! Seriously, don't stress about it!
@SimpleSpouse Difficult, to say the least! But knowing that I have it makes it easy to plan for our future, and what steps we need to take.
@SimpleSpouse other options. It might be hard, but it's definite best to figure it all out.
@SimpleSpouse I was the same way. Unfortunately I did find out about my PCOS, but at least I knew the problem &amp; could start looking for
@unengagedug My mom thinks it's been done so much. Which it has. But I just love the idea.
@SimpleSpouse It's totally normal to be nervous, but also you'll feel better once you have some answers, so you know what your options are.
Okay guys, real talk- are candy buffets cliche/over done?
@SweetheartWife This is still the best thing to happen to me all week.
I would like to thank God this morning for coffee, lipstick, and Pinterest. Thanks boo.
@AdoreMyMan I'm gonna text you!
@AdoreMyMan HEY! Your wedding is NOT tacky. It's gonna be perfect and beautiful. Don't care so much about what people think babe!
@AdoreMyMan I am!
@AdoreMyMan You are!
@AdoreMyMan You made my mind up! Doing it.
I took a really cute selfie and I really wanna picslip it but eh
@CammieRichie I live in gels. Not the best for your nails, but it seriously is so worth it.
Turning on the Bruce Jenner interview at work because I can NOT miss it and it's just not the same recorded.
I'm honestly so excited for @SweetheartWife I could cry. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
@SweetheartWife YAAAAAAAAAAAY
Congratulations to @SweetheartWife! So happy for you! You are proof that miracles do happen! &lt;3
So in addition to a full time assistant wedding coordinator (never ending hours), I will be working 40+ hrs a week at my new job! #hustle
New adventures, new struggles, and new (more) money. Can't beat that! Time to go shopping for a whole new work wardrobe...
Putting in my 2 weeks at the hotel was actually really hard, this has been my home for 2 years. But it's time for newer and better things!
I have been blessed with an amazing new job opportunity, and I will be starting there on May 7th!
@SweetheartWife OMG YAAAAAASSSSS
Just realized I left all my new makeup brushes and makeup that came today all over our bed. C is gonna be so happy when he gets home :/
@ImpulsiveWino We're going tomorrow! So excited.
I NEED A DAIRY QUEEN BLIZZARD. NEED. HAVE TO HAVE IT.
People who walk by the desk screaming at their kids while I'm on the phone are the reason death glares were invented.
@_PickyMommy That is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.
@_PickyMommy what the fuck?!
TWO OF MY ITEMS THAT WERENT SUPPOSED TO GET HERE UNTIL TOMORROW ARE COMING TODAY. THANK YOU USPS GODS <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª
@AdoreMyMan yaaaaaaassssss
#dietlife #lol 
*I think how nice I won't wonder if I'm pregnant 24/7*
*Wonder if I'‚Ä¶
I swear I was cleaning and then I realized I was watching makeup tutorials on YouTube and I just...I don't know what happened.
This is what our centerpieces will look like! But with a calla lilly in them! Three different levels of holders. 
Getting moved up from intern to assistant coordinator really lit a fire under my ass to achieve all the dreams I have.
@SC_Wife Thank you doll! &lt;3
Sometimes I'm listening to contemporary Christian music, sometimes I'm listening to Lana sing about her pussy tasting like Pepsi cola. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèª
Waiting on my new makeup brushes to get delivered is killing me. I NEED THEM NOW.
"Oh my god I'll never be able to eat all of that". *Proceeds to eat all of it, lick the plate, and pick off someone else's plate*
I'm always scared to be one of those girls who either has NO real eyebrows, or has huge bushy crazy eyebrows. I feel I'm at a good middle.
I do wanna learn how to fill them in and stuff better though. I do a little bit but nothing insane.
My eyebrows may not be perfect, but they're so much healthier since I've stopped getting them waxed and have just been doing them myself.
Oh but I also got a super cute cover up thing to wear with like leggings and a tank top. I forgot I bought that. Clearly it was much needed.
Go into Walmart for shampoo, leave with $111 worth of makeup and no shampoo. K.
Went to bed around 9, zero emails. Woke up at 8, 12 emails from current bride. Twelve. 12. 1-2. What the fuck.
Constantly changing my avi/header/bio. I get bored easily. Whatever.
Thanks @Power_Blonde for my new header! Obsessed. #hustle
What happened to @LypstickJungle?
@DisneyFiancee still dying over this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MarriedBetch I actually really want to read this. Why did it make you angry?
*looks in front camera as mirror*
*tilts head 45 degrees*
*purses lips*
Also, would anyone else wanna see that? Like...should I find a way to post this publicly or?
Whoever asked to see my makeup collection on Ask.Fm, could you DM me? I just don't know how you want me to do this. Lol.
I also have this thing where I always love the villains more than the princesses so. We'll see who I'm most excited about.
Everyone keeps asking which princess I'm most excited to see at Disney World and I really can't decide. I have like 4 favorites.
Getting emails that 3 of the items you bought on Mercari were being shipped today is the best thing in the whole world.
@ENews Awful! She made herself look desperate for attention, and dumb.
@myinfinitybey For those kind of things, I think paying the couple bucks for a good app instead of dumb free one is better. Congrats! &lt;3
You bet your sweet ass I'm getting these for our magic bands <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS> @DisneyFiancee 
@DisneyFiancee YES I LIKE ALL THOSE NUMBERS
Also, these numbers are pretty exciting! Under 200 days until we're married! 
Yesterday C made me peanut butter and banana toast and it was the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth.
I've been craving peanut butter non-stop lately. I don't even like peanut butter.
New Royal Baby, all the new Duggar babies...I'm having baby fever for my favorite celebrities.
I NEED TO DELETE THE MERCARI APP.
Will you show us your makeup collection? ‚Äî Um. Sure? Lol. 
Are you good at makeup? ‚Äî I'm okay, I guess. Lol. When I actually sit down and take my time with it, I'm pretty ... 
Has anyone ever used @hitchswitch to change their name after marriage? I have a few questions!
I watched a video about spiders and now I feel like there are spiders everywhere on me
I don't care what anyone says- I effing LOVE the Duggars.
What's the hardest thing about living with someone? ‚Äî For me? It's not really having any alone time. I like my s... 
What are some things you dislike about yourself? ‚Äî This is a hard question for me, because I do have a history w... 
Are you and @disneyfiancee friends in real life? You ... ‚Äî I like to think so! We connected through Twitter, and... 
What was the most important thing to you for your wed... ‚Äî First off, it's rude to ask about money. Just saying.... 
How old are you? ‚Äî 23! 
What kind of planner were you using in the picture yo... ‚Äî If I'm thinking of the right picture, it's an Erin Co... 
Favorite show of all time? ‚Äî THE OFFICE. I've watched the entire series about 10 times. No joke. Chris and I are... 
I'm going through my Ask.Fm today and getting rid of some of these questions you've asked me, so I'll be on today if you have a question!
What is the most played song in your music library? ‚Äî Vienna, by Billy Joel! 
Fucking exhausted.
I wanna be Dita Von Teese so bad I could cry. 
Not but seriously- send me your favorite get ready/party/sexual/about to get crazy music. I need a new playlist.
I need @Jaclynhill to make me a mix tape for when I'm getting ready in the morning. See- Spring Makeup Tutorial, Blurry Extras.
@LifeOfAMrs My fianc√© and I watched that last night and it was terrible lmao
@keepit_chic Favorite song of all time.
*Goes out for some retail therapy to calm down*
@DisneyFiancee SHUT UP I LOVE THIS SO MUCH <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@buster_jamie Where did you find your band?
@buster_jamie How cool! I love it.
I love my ring in the light <TWO HEARTS> 
@futurefiancee Nope! Just a wedding I've coordinated.
Rehearsal is done! Now home to shower, eat, kiss my fianc√©, and get some sleep before the wedding tomorrow! SO EXCITED
@DisneyFiancee She really is! I've learned so much from her.
Oh. Also. Name slip? Is that a thing? Whatever.
My boss calls me 'Ms. Tiffani' to her kids. I love it. Lol.
and you can just see how much her fianc√© adores her!
Lunch break. I can't even tell you guys how beautiful this ceremony is going to be. The bride is the most genuine, sweetest person,
Like. It's perfect. 
Btw that's not MY wedding venue. Venue of the wedding I'm coordinating this weekend. But still. GORGEOUS.
How beautiful is our venue?! 
Be prepared for a ridiculous amount of pictures.
Wedding weekend starts now! Can't wait to see this wedding come together over the next 2 days. All the stress &amp; planning will be worth it!
When I watch Brideszillas and I see brides tell their fathers they can't walk them down the aisle unless they give them money, I get SO mad.

Didn't April start a couple of days ago or something? <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><TIRED FACE>
Both of my parents and myself are dying of either the stomach bug or food poisoning today. Either way, I hope this helps me lose 5lbs.
Kinda wanna watch 8 hours of Netflix
Kinda wanna not wear pants &amp; eat pizza
Kinda wanna look like a‚Ä¶
@iQueenTweets I love mine. I have a normal one and one on a handle, and it works great.
@bridezilla_life excuse my ratchet nails I'm aware of my grossness
"I have surprises for you when I get home" I love him so much <GROWING HEART> 
Thanks to @iQueenTweets I'm now obsessed with Mercari and I'm spending all my money there lol
@TheMrsZilla We have family middle names, but not firsts. I like the respect and the idea behind it.
I'm literally planning our entire honeymoon down to meals each day. I'm sure @DisneyFiancee is loving me right now. Not. lol.
If I only drink water and unsweetened iced tea today, will I be skinny tomorrow? Asking for a friend.
I seriously cannot find a pair of shoes for the wedding. I've seen a few that are nice, but I'm not in LOVE with anything.
anyone, not even my worst enemy. It's the most painful thing.
Hearing the stories about women who find out they can't have kids breaks my heart. I remember that day very well. I never want that for
Just did my first ItWorks Wrap. Not gonna lie, it was pretty awesome. lol.
@mrsbrattywife Oh, mines just phone cases. Not as important as yours. Lol.
I can be in a bad mood without starving myself. Thanks.
Every single time I'm in a bad mood or having a bad day, someone asks when the last time I ate was. Do I look like I haven't eaten? No.
@mrsbrattywife @USPS Currently waiting on a package myself. So irritating.
Today is bachelorette party planning. And waiting on my Disney phone cases I ordered lol
@NewlyEngaged They have some disposable ones that are actually really nice looking, and they don't feel like paper or plastic.
@DisneyFiancee so excited I could puke lol
@DisneyFiancee THAT IS SO INSANE
@DisneyFiancee 210 days until Disney! &lt;3 &lt;3
@DisneyFiancee Yes! I mean obvs we're still going to Disney but still. It sucks.
But. We did buy our honeymoon plane tickets today so...that's exciting.
@LifeLoveWine And it's hard to be angry with her because she found her dream venue and she's so happy. So I guess that's what matters most.
But we chose the original dates that we did so that we could be there for each other. And now we can't anymore and that makes me really sad.
We had gone back and forth over dates when we both got engaged, because we both wanted early November weddings.
@LifeLoveWine She found a venue that only had two weekends open, and she decided she wanted the same as mine instead of the other, I guess.
It's not a matter of sharing the date, but just that we can't be apart of each other's special days now. We've been friends since 6th grade.
So now not only am I not a bridesmaid, we can't even be at each other's weddings. I'm like stupidly sad about this.
Today she decided to change her wedding date. To mine. She's moving her wedding to my day.
So, remember the friend who asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding the weekend after mine?
@CammieRichie As long as possible, yes. But it's not like it'll get played with and written on everyday. It'll last for a long time.
@CammieRichie It's just like a spiral bound calendar, so we'd just hang it up and switch it each month.
@CammieRichie to their birth date. And then every year, on that specific day, we'd know who's birthday it is.
@CammieRichie So if you look at the pictures of this one, it has the month and then all the numbers on the page. People would just sign next
@CammieRichie It's not dated, it just goes monthly. So we could have it out every year and nothing would change since there isn't a year.
@CammieRichie There's multiple lines under each date, so unless like 20 ppl have the same day it should be good lol
@CammieRichie So we'd actually use our guest book instead of shoving it somewhere,
@CammieRichie It's a perpetual calendar, as a guest book for a wedding. Instead of just signing a name, you sign by your birthday.
@SweetheartWife One of my favorite books! The movie is really good, too.
@mrsbrattywife That seems to me the majority vote! There's just something about the second one though...
Option 2: 
Option 1: 
Okay people, I need opinions on a wedding guest book. Who's down to help choose?
Apparently a 15 page packet for the overview of the entire wedding weekend is "a bit much"....? Who woulda thought.
The ruder you are to me, the longer it's gonna take for your room to be clean :) Welcome to customer service, people.
Drove past the church we're getting married in this morning and I got all jittery and butterflies! Only 210 days away! &lt;3 lol
@blonde_american My friend is getting married the weekend after me, and I'm a bridesmaid in her wedding. Real friends don't care.
@blonde_american No! You get married when you wanna get married. It's so dumb that people get mad over that.
@sparklewifey I honestly love it! I wear black 24/7 anyways, plus I love not having to worry about matching the scheme of the wedding.
I WANNA BE KATE MIDDLETON ON MY WEDDING DAY. I ALSO WANT PIZZA AND LEMON COOKIES. HELP.
I'm still trying to use it as an excuse to C to go shopping though lol
Thank God I own so many black dresses. Being an intern with this planner requires black, all day everyday for the whole weekend of a wedding
@arkveggiepants You're making me have to watch this movie again lol
@arkveggiepants Such a good movie though
I NEED TO WATCH SEASON 5 OF PRETTY LITTLE LIARS. HELP.
@SweetheartWife I am Kelly Kapoor. No shame.
@iQueenTweets Have you bought/sold from it? Is it legit?
Just bought the cutest phone cases on Etsy oh my god I can't wait
@iQueenTweets What app is this?
I love my maid of honor more than anyone on the planet. Sometimes even more than C. Lol.

Oh my god I'm getting sooooo much PLL done today
Facebook has officially started giving me Twitter anons as 'people I may know'
<PRINCESS>üèª &lt;- the closest to me as the update gets. Super annoyed.
Guys, ask me stuff on my ask.fm. I'm bored and can't sleep <WEARY FACE> Anything, nothing off limits.
After working the past 8 days in a row, these next two days off are going to be amazing.
The new brown hair emoji is super tan &amp; I'm not super tan so it's like I'm still lying about my identity. I NEED A PALE BROWN HAIR PRINCESS.
I want to get married under a chuppah. 
I love my internship. I learn new stuff all the time! I never would have needed a reason to research Jewish wedding traditions before. lol.
Never mind. Got it.
I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE AND I WANT IT
I WANT THE EMOJI UPDATE
Not complaining, just an observation. lol.
Ever since switching my work schedule up and working mostly nights, my eating habits have changed aka I've not been hungry at all.
@TheMrsZilla I love all of them SO much, I don't know how I'm gonna choose. I think DMB is out because C isn't a huge fan.
@CapeCodClass I need them. Now.
@CapeCodClass THERE'S NEW EMOJIS?!
HELP ME. DAVE MATTHEWS, TRAIN/THEFRAY/MATT NATHANSON, OR LANA THIS SUMMER?! C is only letting me pick one lmao
@sparklewifey <GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART> I owe you one
@sparklewifey Oh my god yaaaaaaasssss. I'll DM you tomorrow, unless you want me to text you?
@sparklewifey I just need to cancel makeup appointments and change the hair appointment schedule we have set.
@sparklewifey I'm interning too and would have no problem calling for someone else, I just can't do it for myself lmao
@sparklewifey SERIOUSLY?! <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Soooo, who wants to pretend to be my wedding planner &amp; call my salon for me tomorrow because I'm a chicken shit?! I'll be your best friend.
But, tomorrow is the last day in my 8 day work week so that's a plus
I'M SO OVER WORK RIGHT NOW. I WANNA GO HOME.
Scariest night at work in a long time.
I just realized all I've eaten today was bananas. First a smoothie, now one at work. Well and diet coke but still. Weird. Bananas.
@unengagedug Omg this is like my holy grail right here.
@DisneyFiancee thanks friend lol
@DisneyFiancee AHHHH I FORGOT TOO! Remind me again tomorrow lmao
The countdown is on! We are at exactly 7 months until the wedding! <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
Lmao if you duck faced in one of your wedding photos I just...I fucking can't with you.
I think C and I are gonna do matching couples tattoos the week of the wedding lmao <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
I WANT A NEW TATTOO SO BAD
Plus it took like 5 stop lights and C screaming at me before I actually got a good hand holding shot so...I better use it.
Went back to my original avi. Thought I was ready for change, but I just love that picture so fucking much.
Obsessively checking to see if the viewing rate on our wedding website has gone up.
I mean it was a bridesmaid but still. SO EXCITING.
MY FIRST GUEST MADE THEIR RESERVATION IN OUR HOTEL ROOM BLOCK
This man staying here has literally the shortest shorts I've ever seen on a man. Like I can see the whites of tops of his thighs. Help.
I CAN'T HELP THAT THE FAMILY NEXT DOOR TO YOU HAS A BABY. BABIES CRY. SORRY ABOUT IT.
I'm gonna lose my shit at work tonight I just know it.
@AdoreMyMan Have you looked at 
@AdoreMyMan @TheMrsZilla think you'd have a hard time getting it fixed.
@AdoreMyMan @TheMrsZilla Lol, I took it as her being nasty. That doesn't mean her work isn't good, but God forbid it came back wrong, I
@AdoreMyMan @TheMrsZilla she seems super rude.
@AdoreMyMan @TheMrsZilla tbh, the owner seems a little bitchy in all her responses to the negative reviews. If you go through and read them,
@AdoreMyMan @TheMrsZilla Send me the link and let me look :)
@AdoreMyMan I've ordered from them &amp; haven't had any issues whatsoever! As long as you read the reviews &amp; they seem to check out, go for it!
@AdoreMyMan Here Comes the Corums!

Her: you know that thing you hang your towel on?

Barber: Say no more 
Things on my 'to buy' list today: new makeup table, candles because I've burned through my haul, and lipstick. Because...I need it.
Yes, it's 8am Easter Sunday at work. Yes, I'm perky &amp; happy &amp; wearing red lipstick &amp; look super cute. But only because I'm shopping after.
@TheMrsZilla No one did mine. Cool. Lol.
My brother is seriously blasting a screamo version of Blank Space right now. What the fuck is happening
I've decided since I have to work tomorrow on Easter, I'm wearing a pretty dress and look precious.
Cleaning all my makeup brushes is like a calming ritual for me.
Fuck you guys for not playing the name game with me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #foreveralone
@TheTexanVixen @IPromiseAlways Same!
@IPromiseAlways Tonya? I know a Tonya that looks just like you lol
@IPromiseAlways Old Navy has the comfiest ones! I always buy in bulk. lol.
@DisneyFiancee @CohabitingGF Found the CUTEST bathing suit at Target the other day!
PEOPLE. LOOK AT MY PICSLIPS RIGHT NOW. Coming down when I leave work so like half an hour. GUESS MY NAME.
@somethingaud Thanks for telling me the truth about it! I think I'm gonna try it. I'm scared but if it sucks I don't have to go again lol
I wanna play that "guess what my name is" game....
@somethingaud always saying "oh, it's not bad at all" just to look like they can take pain. I need the truth. lol.
@somethingaud I really wanna do it for the wedding, I'm just trying to find someone to tell me how much it really hurts. lol. Everyone is
@sparklewifey I live in Northern VA!
Do we like the new avi or go back to the old one? HELP ME I'M SO BORED AT WORK JUST TALK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING lol
@sparklewifey So fun! I've been interning for about 7 months or so and I love it! I don't know any other interns!
@sparklewifey Are you a planner?! So am I!
Somebody tell me the Jesus honest truth about the pain in a brazilian wax. Go.
@DisneyFiancee You're the best friend lol
@DisneyFiancee Which totally reminds me that I need to schedule a cut! Remind me to do that Monday.
@DisneyFiancee .....all is forgiven. lol.
@DisneyFiancee Girl we gotta work on your bribery skills! lol.
Considering changing my avi. I'm bored.
@DisneyFiancee He better get on it! Happy wife, happy life.
@DisneyFiancee Will you bring me melting pot? Tell J I'm dying and I need you to save me.
@DisneyFiancee I just need twitter and ask.fm to distract me lol
@DisneyFiancee There's like a billion kids here and they're all so rude and I just...I can't deal with it. lol.
@DisneyFiancee There's two kids birthday parties here tonight -_- Ready to blow my brains out
@DisneyFiancee Work is just irritating the life our of me at the moment! I'm ready to go home and sleep for the rest of my life.
So, I made a thing.... 

@iQueenTweets Royal Ball is sooooo pretty
Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
Don't start a sentence to me with "No offense but.." because then I'm instantly offended.
Thank God for a fiance who knows just by the sound of my voice that I need a coffee &amp; will go out of his way to bring it to me. Thank. God
Quickly losing enthusiasm to be at work. Send lattes.
@DisneyFiancee My mickey's look a little special.... Lol
@DisneyFiancee I'm just a little excited. 
I'll keep him, I guess. <TWO HEARTS> 
Was getting up early to get my nails done before work but C rolled over and said "Let's just be together today" so...nails Monday then.
@mrsbrattywife Nothing is worse than worn lipstick. Either touch it up when needed or wear none at all. Pick one.
I tried out a new lipstick today for work and I'm about 89% sure I hate it and that is SO sad for me
Yaaaaay going to see @VanHalen in August! Can't wait <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
#KnowYourAnon I have an obsession with caffeine, lipsticks, and My 600-lb Life lmao
@christina_x17 Oh, I forgot about that lol
@christina_x17 DM me, doll &lt;3
#KnowYourAnon I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16 years old.
@christina_x17 Of course! I'd love to help.
#KnowYourAnon My fianc√© and I had been off/on for 5 years before settling down together for good.
#KnowYourAnon I'm currently interning to become a wedding planner, and I'm in LOVE with the whole process.
#KnowYourAnon I used to consider myself a good friend until this year. I've fucked up a lot of things this year that can't be fixed.
#KnowYourAnon I was a theatre major in college, and went to a performing arts high school in FL.
#KnowYourAnon I never expected anyone to follow me/care about what I said. I started this as a place to vent, but I've met amazing people!
Okay I'm doing one because I just surpassed 200 followers and that is AH-MAZING to me!
@DisneyFiancee Ew no don't go
@DisneyFiancee No hate. I just wanna live vicariously through you right now.
@TheMrsZilla Do I just post whatever I want or do people ask me questions I don't know how this shit works but I think it's interesting lol.
Kinda wanna do a #knowyouranon but I don't wanna be annoying lol
@sparklewifey @GingerWifeLife But what's worse is when they only put it on the bottom and not the top and I just..it gives me nightmares.
@CammieRichie Everyone wants to be missed, no matter what they say. It's natural to want the approval of others. It makes total sense.
@CammieRichie That's good! That means you're more over them then you think. Sadness is the first step to get over, so you're doing good.
@CammieRichie absolutely nothing, that would make you a sociopath and that's not okay. lol.
@CammieRichie When you're with someone, no matter how long, it's normal to feel SOMETHING when it's over. No matter what it is. If you felt
@CammieRichie Exactly. Not being angry is the quality that's going to make someone miss you. Not one wants a bitter bitch tbh
@caffeine_cynic I already hate them tbh
@mrsbrattywife I get trenta green teas all the time. They're basically my life line
@CammieRichie I almost feel like that's part of being over them. Realizing how much better you are, and wanting them to see it.
@caffeine_cynic Oh Christ, I cannot deal with that. Who the fuck has a pink tailed pony carry their rings?
@caffeine_cynic Ring bearer pony? lol
@LypstickJungle No such thing!
@DisneyFiancee I'll send you pictures of me drooling over it. lol. The closest one to us now is about 2 hours away :/
@mrsbrattywife That's the plan ;) He's definitely a keeper!
@DisneyFiancee I MISS THE MELTING POT SO MUCH
@DisneyFiancee He really is. He knows how to make me happy. lol.
C is bringing me a green tea and a latte from Starbucks to work because I can't decide and I need all the caffeine
@LadyEngaged I have more nightmares about my groomsmen than anything else.
@Riffsyapp Thank you!
Whenever I hear something by The Four Seasons, I always think of my fianc√©. We're both such nerds over them. Such good music.
GOD DAMN IT I LEFT MY WATER BOTTLE AT HOME
I would strangle someone for a latte right now.
WHY DOES EVERYONE ELSE'S GIF KEYBOARD GIFS SHOW UP AND MINE IS JUST A LINK SOMEONE HELP
Me currently:

If my cake lady doesn't email me back tomorrow, that'll be 2 weeks without a response about my contract. I'm about to blow her shit up.
Nah Suzy, it's cool. I didn't wanna stretch my legs out at all. 
I'm usually about 99% spot on about calling out sketchy people as soon as they show up on PLL.
Is it weird that I like to see how people organize their home screens on their phones? <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
So glad that I don't have to work until 3 tomorrow. Pretty Little Liars alllll nighhhhhht.
Favorite YouTube makeup gurus?!
@TheTexanVixen I feel ya. My entire paycheck goes towards the wedding fund and we live off C's checks. It's still not enough though! lol
@TheTexanVixen Seriously! We try so hard to save but it all ends up going towards the wedding. I feel like there's no point in trying. lol.
I'm making a fitness motivational board today to help inspire me to better myself! Do any of you have one?
@TheTexanVixen Is this Mint?
YAAAAAASSSSS MY ULTA ORDER WILL BE HERE TOMORROW
@DisneyFiancee is probably ready to murder me with all my PLL texts <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Sometimes what people believe is best for you, isn't what's really best for you.
@TheLostWife_ I seriously love Nyx lip products! And I use a few Elf brushes and they're pretty good!
@sparklewifey We're using baby's breath! It's so simple and pretty and romantic. Love it.
I wear it because it's hella fun.
@TheLostWife_ I don't know but when I first saw that I almost had a meltdown lol
@TheLostWife_ It's an April Fools Joke! Thank God.
@sparklewifey Again, I'm not meaning to start an issue with you whatsoever. We just clearly see two sides to an issue and that's okay.
@sparklewifey mean to be offensive or not isn't the point. It IS offensive to some people, that's all my point is.
@sparklewifey to voice their opinion about it. I'm not sorry for being hurt by the same joke every year. It's not funny, and whether people
@sparklewifey Malicious intent or not, it's hurtful. And the same reason people can post those jokes is the same reason people are allowed
@sparklewifey so offended. I'm sorry if I made you upset!
@sparklewifey that you never have to see a pregnancy prank after you've miscarried a child, because then you'll understand why people get
@sparklewifey I'm truly not trying to pick a fight with you about this, obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I just hope
@sparklewifey That's a little different than women who are physically incapable of having children, and I would hope you know that.
@sparklewifey others know when they're being ignorant and offensive.
@sparklewifey It might not be someone's responsibility to make sure other's feelings aren't hurt, but people DO have a responsibility to let
@sparklewifey to have children, and for someone to voluntarily post something so insensitive is not okay.
@sparklewifey would most definitely take offense. It's no different here. Women suffer everyday with different issues that make them unable
@sparklewifey But if someone was posting something that was hurtful or discriminatory to a different race, or the LGBT community people
@sparklewifey Why are people suddenly doing it or why are people taking offense to it?
If I see one more person pretend to be pregnant as a joke today, I will lose my fucking shit.
What readings are you guys doing during your ceremonies?
My hair seriously smells delicious right now.
@AdoreMyMan <KISS MARK><KISS MARK><KISS MARK><KISS MARK>

@SC_Wife Same! It's pathetic, really. I can't walk away from a good makeup sale.
@SC_Wife I told him that he should be glad I spend, because it helps me later on. He's not convinced lol
Thank you, @ULTA_Beauty for making a $150 order into a $35 order with points! Now my fiance can't be mad at my spending :)

@DisneyFiancee I'm planning a binge fest for tonight and all day tomorrow, I'm planning to get into season 3 this evening.
@DisneyFiancee SO pissed lol
M: "SHUT UP IM TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED ALI"
C: "NO ONE DID BECAUSE SHE'S STILL ALIVE"
M: "...ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!"
Me yelling at C to shut up because I'm watching Pretty Little Liars... (c)
Why didn't they mention spencer living next door to Ali in season 1 THIS SHOW IS SO CONFUSING
@DisneyFiancee Ew that's so annoying. Even though this one is hotter so

JUST MAILED OUR SAVE THE DATES I'M GONNA PUKE
Thank you @queenscb for introducing me to the gif keyboard. 
Today's one of those morning where I'm stopping to get coffee on my way to get coffee. Whatever.
Anyone else have that one person that you'll always be jealous of and wish you could have their life? Just me? K.
@AdoreMyMan I think that's what I want for the wedding! I love it so much
Do we like this hair color? 
I'm never mean to them, but I do lie about getting noise complaints from other guests. Whatever.
I'm the person my coworkers count on to yell at the kids in birthday parties when it's getting too loud. I can't deal with it.
@AdoreMyMan @DisneyFiancee Doing it! My mom said it's incredibly helpful.
@AdoreMyMan @DisneyFiancee I WANNA DO THAT! How do you sign up?
@AdoreMyMan @DisneyFiancee Is that like an online thing?
I want so much for the both of us, and sadly, it's gonna take money to get us there.
I really just need C to start getting serious about money. Not only for the wedding, but for the future life we want together.
@_SpoiledGirl 23, he's 24, and we've been on/off for 5 years, official for a year and 5 months, engaged for 5 months!
@DisneyFiancee @AdoreMyMan You should really look into this system! I think it's going to do wonders for me and C.
@AdoreMyMan @DisneyFiancee We've decided to use the cash envelope budgeting system! Have you guys worked on your budgets?
@unengagedug Omg my fiance has the most gorgeous eyelashes on Earth. I'm like how is this even fair?!
@unengagedug My fiance would be the same way. I put mascara on him once and he flipped out, I was like "look how pretty you are!"
@unengagedug I'm laughing so hard at this lol
2 birthday parties, and the CREEPIEST GUY EVER JUST STANDING AROUND STARING AT ME LIKE WHY WHAT DO YOU WANT LEAVE ME BE
Oh my god I may lose my shit at work tonight
@CityLifeLove @notrichbrunette I hate when it's SO obvious someone's wearing a wig.
My favorite housekeeper at work always tells me to relax every time she see's me. Not in a mean way, she can just sense my 24/7 stress.
Working till 11, aka pinning all sorts of Disney ideas and doing more wedding planning. It could be worse, I guess.
@SocietyBrunette Can't say I blame you lol
C's first Old Fashioned. He thinks he's on Mad Men <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@DisneyFiancee My obsession is real and I don't even really know what's going on lol

Our favorite Italian place and scary movies all night for C's birthday. <GROWING HEART>
I check my phone every morning to see if @DisneyFiancee has found out about free dining for my trip &amp; because she's just as excited as me.
Yes, I am spending $70 on specific wedding stamps BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE PERFECT.
@LifeLoveWine Me too! It's in my planner. lol. I seriously starred like 30 things. I need them all.
@AdoreMyMan I've been there, babe! I'm always a text away if you need anything, or just to talk. I know what you're going through!
@LifeLoveWine I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I want the one in my fans or whatever it's called. The blue one. lol.
@StayAtHomeMom_ Same
@LifeLoveWine Me too! There's a bunch of dresses and bathing suits I want for my honeymoon
@AdoreMyMan All of my drug store brand stuff is CoverGirl! I love everything that they make.
I don't care what anyone says, the Lilly for Target line is cute as fuck.
Today is one of those days. I'm sure C is so pleased. Happy Birthday :)
I get on these kicks where I'm like "I'M GONNA GET US SKINNY AND ON A BUDGET AND REBUILD OUR ENTIRE LIVES"
@DisneyFiancee @AdoreMyMan Go to 
@AdoreMyMan Pretty sure my parents took that a while ago and it worked for them! Pass along all your knowledge!
@DisneyFiancee @AdoreMyMan I don't even know where to start, but I know we need to. LET'S ALL BE BUDGETING BUDDIES AND HELP EACH OTHER.
@AdoreMyMan Are you guys doing a strict budget? What do you do?
Who was on here just the other day talking about how her and her husband were trying to learn how to budget? I NEED A BUDGETING BUDDY.
Having more in our savings than our checking makes me feel like a real grown up. SHIT IS GETTING REAL.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, C! &lt;3 Still have no idea what I'm getting him btw. Hate my life.
I'm sure he loves me so much. 
@DisneyFiancee I was up until 5 watching this, just woke up from my nap to start again lol

Okay started PLL from the beginning. Let's do this.
The commercial with Mr. Potato Head eating a bag of potato chips creeps me out and I don't know why.
I also didn't eat the bread that came with my salad so I already feel skinny.
@DisneyFiancee Fingers crossed! #stressed #needtolose50pounds
@DisneyFiancee Truly I think I'm more excited for Disney than the wedding<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Ordered a grilled chicken salad today because I just realized I only have 227 days until I wear the most important dress of my life.
Best part about tearing apart my closet to pack is finding clothes I thought I lost. LIKE MY PERFECT LEATHER JACKET <TWO HEARTS><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

I know he's joking, but a joke about being pregnant when that will likely never happen hurts more than he realizes.
I seriously am feeling so nauseous today, and C's first instinct is to tell me I'm pregnant. I don't think he realizes how much that stings.
MY BOX CAME YAAAAASSSS <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I'm such a chicken shit when it comes to talking to people on the phone. I need to cancel makeup appointments BUT IM SCARED <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>

Today, we are waiting on my Kate Spade packages to come in the mail. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@AdoreMyMan You are! &lt;3 &lt;3
@TheMrsZilla It's hard to detect my sarcasm in person, so all is forgiven on the internet lol
@TheMrsZilla No one pushed me around. I was being sarcastic lol. I genuinely do not care at all about her stupid rules.
Please stab me.
I said, "I'm a woman, of course I know how" like, just joking and not he's lecturing me on how I'm worth SO MUCH MORE than that.
The guy I'm working with tonight asked me to go take the cookies out of the oven, and then he asked if I knew how.
Why do I drink more water out of my super cute water bottle than an actual plastic bottle?
Deleted my picslip so I don't get "called out" for "forgetting about it". So fucking stupid, I swear. #StopPicslips2k15 #ShuttheFuckUp2015

My photographer wants to take my bridal portraits in DC at the museums! SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW
@DisneyFiancee SO SO happy for you! I knew you were gonna be great at this!
@AdoreMyMan You should look into it! I just mentioned it to my photographer and now we've got this whole plan going. lol.
@AdoreMyMan her. Just a day of extra fun, really :)
@AdoreMyMan lol, you're not stupid. It's basically just pretty pictures done of just the bride in her dress, all dolled up. No one else with
My photographer and @DisneyFiancee are my favorite vendors and nothing and no one will ever change that- looking @ you, needy caterer lady
@waywardfiancee I don't know if it's a MUST. But a lot of brides like to do it. And I think I would too. I just forgot that I wanted to lol
How far in advance of your wedding are you supposed to do your bridal portraits? Because...I kinda forgot about those. My bad.
@TheTexanVixen WE WANNA SEE!
But I'm also super pissy and will probably rip someone's head off if they look at me the wrong way so...probs gonna Nyquil nap later.
Haven't slept at all for the past two nights and I'm that weird kind of tired that I could probably run a marathon right now.
My FKA Twigs obsession is real.
I woke up to two emails saying both my stamp and all my Kate Spade things I ordered yesterday have already been shipped. #blessed
@DisneyFiancee Pretty sure you're his favorite person right now too for taking away all this stress! Lol

@mysweetone_ I got mine on Etsy this morning! It's such a good idea.
@mysweetone_ Colors were easy for me. It's finding everything in my colors that I actually like that's the problem lol
@TheLostWife_ Are you on any BC? That's what it all sounds like.
@TheLostWife_ Any changes to your diet recently? That ALWAYS makes a huge change in my skin.
Why is choosing an invitation suite so difficult for me...
"I NEEDED that Kate Spade stuff, C. You wouldn't understand. It's for the wedding." "Oh, well in that case I guess it's fine". lololol
Every single thing I buy anymore, I just say that it's "for the wedding" that way no one can yell at me lol
Just ordered the cutest stamp to use for all our envelopes for save the dates and invites! I'm not trying to write each one out. Lol.
@StayAtHomeMom_ really excited and their brains don't go as fast as ours do! He'll be fine :)
@StayAtHomeMom_ Totally normal. My 4 year old cousin does the same thing, and we thought she needed a speech pathologist. She just gets
Okay, a pair of earrings, 5 clutches, and a bracelet later...I think my wedding is done with Kate Spade.
@mysweetone_ Exactly! If you get it all a little at a time, it's not such a shock to your bank account lol.
@mysweetone_ Whatever! At least you have them. You can't beat a deal like that.
@mysweetone_ I got a gold one for myself lol. I got the red/pink MOH BM clutches for the girls.
@mysweetone_ Oh, you mean the one that came with like, gold black silver or multi colored sparkles?
@mysweetone_ Yay, for sure. My colors aren't red or pink and I still got them. They're just cute. lol.
@mysweetone_ makeup bag things for $29!!!
@mysweetone_ YES. Seriously they have AMAZING deals going on right now. I just bought a ton of stuff. They have super cute bridesmaids/MOH
Just sitting here stalking our online banking for C's check to go through so I can buy a fuck ton of Kate Spade stuff. Normal.
@DisneyFiancee TODAY'S THE DAY! &lt;3

Makeup trial, save the dates, and garter all taken care of today <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
@AdoreMyMan Okay good! I'm so nervous about this what is my problem lol
@AdoreMyMan Can I just do concealer and mascara because I just can't leave the house with nothing on lmao
Genuine question- Should I wear makeup into my makeup trial or should I wear nothing? I don't know how this works
@DisneyFiancee is literally a genius and a lifesaver and I cannot thank her ENOUGH for being our Disney TA and taking over my stress <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
@myinfinitybey Gotta pick your battles, momma! <GROWING HEART>

Having one of those days where I realize how much weight I've put on since C and I moved in together and I'm miserable.
I'm already having nightmares over my bridal mani and finding the perfect flats. Halp me
Still not used to owning things that day 'Bride' on them! 
@DisneyFiancee Gotta get your Disney on first, girl! Lol
@MommaBird_27 I LOVE my Erin Crondren planner!
@DisneyFiancee OH MY GOD WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!
A friend sent me a package, and it's a pair of the Disney Bride Ears and a 'happily ever after' pin <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS> @DisneyFiancee
ALSO JUST REMEMBERED C BOUGHT ICE CREAM CUPCAKES LAST NIGHT. #fatday is in full effect. Judge me.
@I_TheeWed @AdoreMyMan  I'm just terrified I'm gonna forget something so I want it all spelled out for me
@AdoreMyMan @I_TheeWed  but like, I want a list with like- candles, tables cloth, cake knife. All that kind of stuff. Like EVERYTHING.
@AdoreMyMan SOMEONE GIVE US A PLANNING LIST WAAAAAAH <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
I honestly can't wait to see @Cirque at Disney World again on our honeymoon. #LaNouba #ILOVECIRQUEDUSOLEIL
@CammieRichie Same
OUTBACK FOR DINNER YAAAAAASSSS THANK YOU BABY JESUS <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@AdoreMyMan Yes and I can't find a perfect one. They're like, a watered down version. I want a list of EVERYTHING lol
@AdoreMyMan Absolutely! I need one so bad so I can start marking off when I get something.
I need an all inclusive list for everything I need to make sure I pack/buy/get for the wedding. From point A to point B. Anyone have one?
Eating cereal out of a metal cooking pot because I'm too lazy to clean a dish. Cool.
Whenever they say they hate a dress, I yell 'JUST PUT IT ON, YOURE GONNA LOVE IT OH MY GOD' because that's what happened to me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Watching SYTTD and comparing these girls' experience to mine.
Wedding planning by candle light to keep myself zen instead of ripping someone's face off <TWO HEARTS><INFORMATION DESK PERSON> 
@mysweetone_ I used Wedding Wire! MUCH cuter and easily customizable than the knot
Already counting down the days to the honeymoon <TWO HEARTS> 
And it's cuter now anyways so <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Fuck it I just made a whole different wedding website on a completely different wedding host because I don't have time for this shit
I'M HAVING A SERIOUS MELTDOWN OVER THIS WEBSITE RIGHT NOW
YEP. KINDA NEED THAT. @theknot 
This is seriously so aggravating. I go to finish up my website today, and it tells me it's not even there anymore. @theknot I need some help
Hey @theknot, can someone explain to me why I'm getting an error code saying my wedding website doesn't exist anymore? This is ridiculous.
One of my bridesmaids has already bought her bachelorette party dress, that isn't even planned. Not her bridesmaid dress though. lol.
This is going to be a seriously long week.
I literally cry every single time I listen to the song I'm walking down the aisle to.
@myinfinitybey People literally attribute they're pregnancies to this app lol
@myinfinitybey And they really spell everything out for you. It's fantastic.
@myinfinitybey Yes! It's seriously amazing. They have message boards, and I've met so many people who will help you.
@myinfinitybey No, they're two separate ones. Clue is mostly for period, but Glow is wonderful if you're TTC
@myinfinitybey Congrats! Use Glow and Clue to track everything <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
We're either crossing this bridge, or we're burning it
Eating my way through sexual frustration. Its fine.
@Wifed_First You need to use 8tracks for that kind of stuff! Lol
@CohabitingGF Like, she wanted to be nice, but she didn't wanna pay to feed you and stuff lol
@CohabitingGF Honestly, it sounds to me like she was just inviting you guys out of kindness but wasn't counting on you guys coming.
Oh. And it's my brothers birthday. Oops.
Hanging out with some college girlfriends for lunch! But I would much rather work on my guest list today, to be honest.
I asked him why and he said 'Jesus took away an hour this morning. We're not best friends right now' and rolled right back over <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
C's alarm went off at 10:30 so he could go to church. Woke up at 10:50 to him to still here.
@fatalkisses your handwriting is perfect!
I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW. We made our honeymoon plans! THANKS BABY JESUS.
@GingerWifeLife Do it. No regrets. lol.
@VuittonAndVodka I melt over his voice. Never Think is like..baby making music. lol.
@DisneyFiancee Yes! I'm currently making a list of all the DIY stuff I need to do. lol
@DisneyFiancee I work until 11 and I'm trying to use wedding pinterest to keep me awake and alert. Well that and Red Bull.
@VuittonAndVodka I love it, everyone hated on the movie but the soundtrack was fantastic.
@DisneyFiancee FINALLY. I've been waiting on you. lol.
Okay. What do we think about facts about me and my fiance on each table? As little reading material?
Hi I have to work all night so let's talk weddings. HELP KEEP ME AWAKE AND EXCITED.
I WANT OUR TAX MONEY I HAVE WEDDING THINGS THAT I NEED* TO BUY. 

*Really just want right this very second- not so much a need but whatevs.
@AdoreMyMan I was so embarrassed lol
@AdoreMyMan He group texted all of them &amp; said 'I'm engaged &amp; apparently you douche bags have to stand with me. See you then.' So sweet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AdoreMyMan We compromised! Same dress, just long and short for them to choose from <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@CityLifeLove WELCOME GIRL. GOT YOUR BACK.
@CityLifeLove AND I'LL TAKE YOUR HAND AND LIFT YOU UP
@DisneyFiancee GONNA BE THE BEST THING EVER!
I forgot to tell @DisneyFiancee that I am SUPER PROUD OF HER FOR MAKING HER DREAMS COME TRUE. YOU DO YOU, BOO BOO. &lt;3
OH. ALSO.
Thank God for my loving and understanding bridesmaids because they just saved me from a serious mental breakdown over their dresses.
Do people realize that I can see when they read a message in  group forum on FB or do they just not give a fuck THAT I'M WAITING FOR ANSWERS
OH MY GOD I DON'T CARE WHAT WE EAT AT THE REHEARSAL DINNER. I WILL BE DYING OF NERVES BY THAT POINT ANYWAYS. SO SHUT UP ABOUT IT. SHUT UPPP.
If I loved my experience, I will praise everything. If I didn't like it, you will know every. single. reason. why.
I'm one of those people who fill out surveys that you get in your email after you've been somewhere and am BRUTALLY honest.
Poll: For bridesmaids dresses, should they all be one length, or is short and long okay? PLEASE HELP ME.
@AdoreMyMan I know! But, everyone in my bridal party gets $20 off a dress at DB since I bought my dress there.
@AdoreMyMan Um, they're kind of all in the same price range.
@AdoreMyMan I fell in love with one on there, and all the girls like it too. Maybe I should just stay with that choice. Keep it simple.
@AdoreMyMan I can, but she lives 17 hours away, and she REALLY loves our first choice. And so do I. I just have confusion now lol
@AdoreMyMan perfect for my wedding.
@AdoreMyMan My original dress is from a website called Azazie, but DB has some really pretty ones too. They're 2015 season colors are
I thought I found my bridesmaids dresses but I just found some really, REALLY pretty ones that are making me confused.
@TheTexanVixen Let us see when you get them because if they're good I want one too!
I woke up really wanting to clean &amp; cook some soup before work today. But I also woke up with insane cramps &amp; a migraine. So no. Not moving.
The thought of never having a child of my own is the thing that keeps me up at night.
But then the months I actually do get a period, I cry and tell myself I'm such a failure.
The months I don't get a period, aka more often than not, in the back of my mind I pretend that maybe I'm pregnant. Though I know I'm not.
PCOS is such a bitch.
@bride_be Honestly, I just use regular wheat tortillas. Like, ones for tacos. Lol. All the ones meant for 'weight loss' are gross to me.
@bride_be Nope. No. I hate them.
I don't know what I want in life really, but I DO know I wanna look like @ChelseaHouska while I do it.
I would punch someone in the face for Hibachi right now
@MarriedSouthern Same exact thing happened here! I was so happy!
@StayAtHomeMom_ We're planning on getting them the day we get married, in our wedding attire for good pictures <WINKING FACE>
@TheMrsZilla Also my MIL would pull that same shit with my fianc√© and it's annoying as hell lol
@TheMrsZilla This actually made me tear up a little bit lol
@DisneyFiancee IM LITERALLY SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Post wedding planning meltdown, fianc√© and I are enjoying a snow day filled with Talenti and Redbox. No wedding talk whatsoever. Thank God.
@AdoreMyMan I'm seriously having a mini meltdown right now
DO NOT FUCK WITH ME OVER MY WEDDING. I WILL CUT YOU. LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.
Just told C's brothers boyfriend he can't come to the wedding because of how fucking rude he is.
Yay C gets a snow day too! Now I get to make him miserable by making him grocery shop with me <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PURPLE HEART>
I'm going to attempt to grocery shop in the snow storm. Might die. Worth it for coffee. Whatevs.
Wine, Klonopin, and a bath. Couldn't be happier. 
@DisneyFiancee I just didn't respond because really...he has nowhere else to go. I knew his ass would be home. Lol.
@TheNerdGf I was the flower girl and my brother was the ring bearer in our parents wedding. Nothing wrong with it girl!
C just asked me if he should even come home tonight because of my 'attitude' so hahahaha tonight is gonna be fun <UNAMUSED FACE><PISTOL>
@TheNerdGf I want that in grown up size
@DisneyFiancee Like the girl on right is so rude, and plays the victim. It's so irritating.
It makes me so mad when the patients on 600lb Life are super rude and nasty to the people trying to help them.
8-10 inches of snow tomorrow. What the actual FUCK, VIRGINIA. WHAT IS HAPPENING?
Watching My 600 Pound Life and inhaling cinnamon toast crunch. Story of my life.
Um. What kind of wedding caterer doesn't do tastings...?
@somethingaud I'm about half and half. Socially awkward like Tina, good at plotting and getting myself in trouble like Louise.
@AdoreMyMan Absolutely. I'm way too awkward for heels.
Meal planning makes the work day fly by, I just realized it's almost noon! Thanks baby Jesus!
@AdoreMyMan Saaaaaame. I thought I knew which ones I wanted but they won't match my dress now.
@AdoreMyMan That's so cool! Did the money go towards awareness?
@AdoreMyMan Thank you! Yours is perfect! And that beading is stunning. Did you get yours at DB?
@AdoreMyMan It was everything I thought I hated until I put it on. lol.
@AdoreMyMan GIRL. SAME. The dress I got was literally the dress she brought in and I said "that's hideous" lmao
@AdoreMyMan DM me a picture of yours! I'm dying to see
@AdoreMyMan the first try, so I don't have to stress about that anymore.
@AdoreMyMan Oh stop! I'm sure yours will be beautiful! I just want everything planned now, you know? lol. I'm just glad I found my dress on
@AdoreMyMan I feel like I haven't! We're still working on catering and a baker for the cake.
Having a little bit of best friend jealously and I don't know how to handle it. SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.
@AdoreMyMan Exactly! It's flying by. I honestly couldn't imagine doing it any sooner!
@AdoreMyMan I couldn't wait. lol. My mom said she's surprised I'm waiting as long as I am. lol.
@_PickyPregnancy Precious! Congratulations!
@AdoreMyMan Not even a full year. lol.
@AdoreMyMan Exactly! In just a couple months I won't ever be able to say it ever again! lol.
It's still so weird calling C my fiance. But it's also the most fun amazing thing in the whole world.
I wasn't hungry until I started meal planning and now I'm day dreaming about lasagna soup HALP ME
@TheTexanVixen So beautiful!
It's taking every ounce of strength to not waste my tax return on a new tattoo.
@DisneyFiancee You need to follow my food pinterest board!
@AdoreMyMan Literally my life.
@MrsStudent1 
@DisneyFiancee We're gonna get our shit together! Lol.
@MrsStudent1 People used to try and use that on me. I'd always be like 'oh good, you can see obvious things. Good for you.' Lol
@DisneyFiancee Yay! Good job <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è I'm doing the same thing at work today!
@MrsStudent1 What the fuck? What is wrong with people?
@DisneyFiancee @TypicalWifey Waaaaaah I'm on this! lol. Not the correct spelling of my name, but I'm pretty sure it still counts lol.
@CityLifeLove Girl. Just wait. Lol.
@selfeequeen I shared it so hopefully we'll get the word out!
@selfeequeen Will do!
@coffeemomma_ @DisneyFiancee Um can we have lazy day on Thursday because I'm off that day and I want to be included lol
GUYS. HAS ANYONE USED SECRET EXTENSIONS?! I WANT THEM SO BAD.
@DisneyFiancee You are! <YELLOW HEART>
I'm definitely not an easy person to love, so he is an incredible man for dealing with what he does.
I may complain about him a lot, but I am so thankful for my fianc√©. I love him more than I could ever say.
I could watch Catfish, all day everyday.
Any tips on how to start my fitness journey now, but not lose a crazy amount of weight before November?
Okay, I only wanna lose 10lbs for the wedding, so my dress will still fit tight, but I wanna start working on eating better &amp; working out.
@ModrnTrophyWife I love this!
@TheTexanVixen I like Wedding Countdown, because you can add your own picture as the background. It's cute.
I WOULDNT HAVE GIVEN YOU AN OPTION IF I WANTED TO CHOOSE.
My biggest pet peeve is when I give my fianc√© an option between two things and he says 'up to you'.
@stonecoldbetch YES
@LittleChicMiss That green dress in the top left corner is to die for.
@IHOP IHOP THIS IS IMPORTANT
@IHOP Can you get free pancakes for take out? I'm bed ridden and my fianc√© wants to bring me some. Hook a sick girl up.
Let's go to Paris.
All I've had today is a salad and a green tea but I'm feeling serious guilt over it. I hate this feeling. <NEUTRAL FACE>
I need some pretty wallpapers for my phone. Send me some suggestions!
@SimpleSpouse I wanted to hurt someone in that store today. Lol.
@SimpleSpouse Seriously, it's such a joke. First phone had a serious meltdown, and then the replacement phone locked me out.
SECOND PHONE IN 4 DAYS AND IM READY TO MURDER SPRINT.
Only ate once today but I'm feeling really guilty about it. I'm hoping I'm just feeling all off because I'm sick. Relapse is not an option.

But I also like consistency so I'll stick with naps and coffee.
The check in girl at my doctors office is a complete idiot. I cannot stand her. Especially when I'm this sick. I wanna punch her face off.
Okay seriously after I kick this flu I am going to start working out after work. EVERYONE MAKE ME WORK OUT AFTER WORK WHEN I FEEL BETTER.
@DisneyFiancee For sure! I'm gonna message you if I'm tempted to eat unhealthy and you can yell at me lol
@DisneyFiancee 100% agree. We eat out way too much and you can definitely tell in my weight <NEUTRAL FACE>
@DisneyFiancee Lets do this together! I seriously need to get my shit together
Down with the flu, stressing about wedding stuff, and crying because I can't paint my nails like my salon girl. Bye.
@stonecoldbetch If I retweet this tweet do I have a double chance of winning because I need that chubby stick in my life

Winner picked Tuesday. <HEART WITH RIBBON><SPARKLES><LIPSTICK><KISS MARK> 
@bmbshllbrntt He was happy with whatever I wanted. As long as I had his last name, he didn't care about the rest
@bmbshllbrntt I'm taking my fianc√©' last name, and adding my step fathers last name as a second middle name.
@NewlyEngaged What changed your mind? And what made you anti marriage to begin with? Not being rude, just curious!
@NewlyEngaged engaged forever?
@NewlyEngaged But engaged means that the endgame is to be married. So are you guys planning on actually getting married or just staying
@NewlyEngaged If you're anti-marriage...why are you engaged? Just wondering.
@ohiowife_mommy That's great! I think that's super sweet <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@ohiowife_mommy You got married the day after you got engaged?!
(Because everyone else is doing this.) Dating: Off/On since 2010. Engaged: November 29, 2014. Married: November 7, 2015. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@AdoreMyMan YAY!
@LadyEngaged We're working on this now too!
@DisneyFiancee I'm so in love with it. It's perfect!
And since I know you were all wondering, I SAID YES TO A DRESS <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Went a whole 24 hours without a phone. Almost died.
OH SWEET GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING
I JUST SAW WHITE AND GOLD
GUYS
I'M GOING WEDDING DRESS SHOPPING TOMORROW. QUE MELTDOWNS AND CRYING AND NERVES AND SHAKING AND DYING.
CROSBY AND JASMINE'S WEDDING SONG 'IS TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY LOVE?' I'M SOBBING.
Also Sarah and Mark breaking up on @nbcparenthood is probably the most painful thing to happen to me this year.
First the llamas today, now this fucking dress... the world is ending today guys.
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight until I figure out this dress situation.
@stridestruggles ^ ALL I SEE IS BLUE
C and I both see black/blue. SO THAT MEANS WE'RE SOUL MATES RIGHT?
DOES ANYONE TRULY KNOW THE COLOR OF THE DRESS THIS IS THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF OUR GENERATION
I mean is it two separate dresses or what I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING WITH THAT DRESS
I DONT WANNA WORK BY MYSELF TONIGHT <WEARY FACE>
@waywardfiancee Where was your shop located? I wanna see if I can get the same girl, I'm terrified of getting a mean consultant lol
@DisneyFiancee I was sad for you lol
@DisneyFiancee PRAISE <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Just stepped on my slipper and thought I stepped on a cat and then I remembered I don't have a cat
@DisneyFiancee Nooooo
Working my first 3-11 tonight in over a year and I'm super nervous about it <WEARY FACE>
@waywardfiancee Is that where you got your dress from? I have an appointment there tomorrow!
Just waiting on My 600 Pound Life to come on. @TLC
@AdoreMyMan Lol I want ALL the pictures. What day is your appointment?
@AdoreMyMan No pictures of pretty dresses you put on silly lol
@AdoreMyMan I seriously have had nerves to the point of not being able to eat for a week. I'm so anxious.
@AdoreMyMan Maybe that was my problem. I tried to do it cold turkey. Thought I was dying.
This will never not be funny 
@AdoreMyMan Also I need pictures
@AdoreMyMan IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE
@AdoreMyMan I drink water everyday, but also sweet tea and diet coke. I tried just water and my caffeine headaches were terrible.
@AdoreMyMan oh my god I need your self control
FUCKING SUPPORT WOMEN DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT TO FUCKING DO FUCK
"I'm a feminist I believe in equality for women oh wait you wanna be a stay at home mom NO THATS WRONG NO NO NO DO MORE"
@TheReadingWife We are! It's a surprise for him at the rehearsal dinner
Could you fucking not
Did anyone else feel physically ill when they went dress shopping? My nerves are killing me.
C. That's how. That little shit.
HOW AM I OUT OF DIET COKE? I NEVER RUN OUT OF DIET COKE.
Pinning and planning our future home all day today. All I really want is double sinks and a laundry room. And a dishwasher. And a big closet
Starbursts are my whole entire life.
@futurefiancee I'm trying to keep that in mind! But I'm a tiny bit of a pushover when it comes to my family :/
I COULD diy all this wedding stuff...or just pay someone on Etsy to do it for me. Probably with better results.
@AdoreMyMan Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm overthinking this way too much lol.
I hate the mornings when I want breakfast, because those are the days where I inhale everything in sight.
@AdoreMyMan The bun 
@AdoreMyMan But like...biggest day of life cute? lol. I also have one thats a low bun that everyone likes more. let me find that one.
@AdoreMyMan A little less messy, but still tousled. Me and all my girls will have braids in our hair somewhere. 
Agree or disagree? Mind you...it's a super cute ponytail. lol.
I found a super cute hairstyle for the wedding that I LOVE, but it's a ponytail. Everyone says that your wedding day is not a ponytail day.
Okay, I need opinions on something!
@IPromiseAlways on that too! It really is cheaper to just grocery shop instead of eating out. And healthier too.
@IPromiseAlways a week, but that's because I'm not a couponer and I wasn't really paying attention to sale items and stuff. But I'm working
@IPromiseAlways us back to normal. And for us, that was grocery shopping once a week, every week for meals. I would usually spend about $70
@IPromiseAlways I used to be really good about grocery shopping every week, but we've started eating out more and more. It's my goal to get
Have you ever had a migraine so intense that the next day your head is physically tender to the touch?
PEOPLE WHO TALK FROM FAR AWAY WHILE I'M LOOKING DOWN OR AT THE COMPUTER MAKE ME SO MAD. WAIT UNTIL I MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH YOU. ANIMAL.
I seriously am having so much anxiety about going dress shopping Friday.
7:12am. Feel like I got hit by a bus. I've already cried this morning. Gonna be a wonderful day.
@AdoreMyMan Aren't they?! I just stumbled upon them and I really think I want to order them.
@AdoreMyMan 2nd pair listed! I love them so much.
@AdoreMyMan They're sparkly silver with a scalloped edge. Go to 
@AdoreMyMan I'm all about comfort girl lol
@AdoreMyMan I wish I could do heels because they make my legs look SO good, but I know I'll be hating myself half way through my ceremony.
@wife_nextdoor So many potential vendors have missed my business over that. Like, I don't have weeks to wait for you to message me back.
@AdoreMyMan Two reasons. 1) I can't walk in them and they make me SO uncomfortable. 2) Fiance is only a SMIDGE taller than me. lol.
@wife_nextdoor THIS. I feel this so hard right now while I'm planning the wedding. It's the most frustrating thing!
@AdoreMyMan Oh my word this is making me so excited lol.
@AdoreMyMan I know for SURE I'm not doing heels, so thankfully I don't have to worry about that. lol.
@AdoreMyMan Also, do I bring like a strapless bra or anything? lol
@AdoreMyMan Well they won't be here by Friday, but should I bring another pair of flats to try dresses on?
Found the cutest Betsey Johnson flats for the wedding! I'm so in love. Can you buy your wedding shoes before you buy your dress? lol
@PNWwifelife My life every single weekend. lol
Literally just had a consultant change her schedule so she can help me at my appointment on Friday. Not sorry.
@TheSpoiledWife really love too. I guess I just need to try everything on and see what's best.
@TheSpoiledWife That's where I'm at! I found a Vera Wang that I'm OBSESSED with, and it's a big dress. But I'm finding some trumpets that I
The people at David's Bridal officially think I'm insane, and I couldn't care less.
The more I look at trumpet/mermaid style dresses online, the more I love them. And I was DEAD set on not wearing one before.
@Queen_of_Fries That happened to me once! I had to have SO much proof that I actually did it myself. It was insane.
Are you fucking kidding me right now
You ever feel like nothing will ever go right in your life &amp; everything is constantly horrible &amp; you'll never catch a break? No? Just me?
And my friend just realized I have a flat on my car. This Tuesday can suck it.
When you guys went dress shopping, did you print out pictures or did you have them on your phone to show the consultant what you like?
@MrsZilla_ awesome about it and helping me create my photos timeline this early.
@MrsZilla_ don't want them to think it's all set in stone right now, you know? It's really stressing me. Thankfully my photographer is being
@MrsZilla_ I mean I understand why they want a schedule (they're paid by the hour so they want to know how much to contract me for) but I
My wedding is 8 months away, I don't know what the timeline is gonna be like yet.
I have to come up with a tentative day of timeline for my DJ by the end of the week and it is SO stressful.
I woke up feeling so nauseous this morning around 3am and it still hasn't passed. Please don't let me be getting sick PLEASE NO
@DisneyFiancee @undergradwife 23!
@DisneyFiancee so obsessed
Okay, seriously all my brides: best teeth whitening and skin regimens that you used for your wedding. Please help a girl out.
Most painful zit of my entire life coming in right now.
My life today. 
Can I just wear J.Lo's Oscar dress as my wedding dress?
Literally everything feels like it's falling apart and I'm so close to flipping my shit today
@TheReadingWife Reasonable! The place I REALLY wanted was over 4k
@HappilyEvAft Every single penny goes to the wedding. It's so stressful.
@HappilyEvAft 100% feel you
Tea and almond milk is everything to me.
‚Äú@SequinedSuccess: Can I look like Anna Kendrick now? 
@AdoreMyMan How far are you with planning? You can DM me if you want :)
@AdoreMyMan Lol it's totally fine! No worries :)
@AdoreMyMan YES. I'm in desperate need of one lol
@undergradwife @DisneyFiancee Of course! Also, @DisneyFiancee is basically a goddess at Disney planning lol
@undergradwife @DisneyFiancee Literally just book your trip online. Rooms and tickets and everything included.
@undergradwife @DisneyFiancee lol it's fine girl!
@undergradwife @DisneyFiancee Yeah! You book online, put $200 down, and then make a payment each month
@DisneyFiancee Girl you're preaching to the choir lol
@DisneyFiancee and making reservations and fast passes and stuff like that. It's just all too much lol
@DisneyFiancee We know we wanna do the thing where you make payments every month towards your package. We just don't know about restaurants
@DisneyFiancee Okay seriously I will pay you to help me lol
@DisneyFiancee Omg be my disney travel agent <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
Never thought I would say this but I got those like, premade coffee things that come in a milk carton yesterday and I'm OBSESSED.
CATFISH MARATHON YAAAAASSSS <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TROPICAL FISH>
@DisneyFiancee Lol we just did that too! He's all about the trumpet/mermaid style. I'm going shopping on Friday and I'm so nervous!
Making C watch Say Yes to The Dress all day so he can tell me what he likes and doesn't like. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@DisneyFiancee That's where we want to stay for our honeymoon!
In preparation for being snowed in this weekend I bought the necessities: wine, vodka, celery, diet coke, and chessman cookies. #futurewife
@TypicalWifey Super close to me!
He's so good to me, he makes me want to be better for him. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I'm so thankful for my fianc√©. Woke up early on his own to start my car this morning so I didn't freeze, and bought movie tickets tonight.
@SimpleSpouse @Momma_Wife @I_TheeWed @idreamofdaisies @NAMx19 @taylormadewife @MrsStudent1 Thanks doll!
Bought my wedding band yesterday. Shit is getting real.
@TheLostWife_ Literally the story of my life
@lil_miss_caf My app has crashed a couple times but it's never frozen my phone or anything. I would def call.
Honestly, seeing Amber's growth is my favorite part of this show. Favorite character by far. @nbcparenthood @maebirdwing
Not fittings, dress shopping. Haven't found a dress. So stressed about it.
Next week: two cake tastings, first hair/makeup trial, 4 dress fitting appointments. Cue stress related breakdowns.
I'm taking Biotin, but I notice a bigger difference in my nails than my hair, and my hair is what I really wanted it to help!
I seriously need some tips on how to get healthier hair. I want it to be long for the wedding &amp; though it's growing, it's not healthy.
I want to buy SO MANY GIFTS for my flower girls and ring bearer lol. Etsy has the cutest stuff!
The worst part about the computer update at work is having to sign back in to all my favorite sites -_- I DON'T REMEMBER PASSWORDS
That means I'm currently drinking water instead of coffee. Heads may roll today.
So for Lent, C and I gave up an "unhealthy lifestyle" since we do a lot of things we feel are bad for us, we couldn't choose just one. lol.
I cry whenever Kristina cries. Which turns out...is a lot. @nbcparenthood
Not especially religious, but I'm considering giving something up for Lent. Any suggestions?
@LilMiss_Prozac HOUSE OF CARDS!
@HisSweetheart_ special. But it was still an amazing moment, so whether you know or not you'll be so happy.
@HisSweetheart_ Exactly! The place he ordered my ring from royally screwed up and I ended up finding out about it. Made it a little less
Waaaaaah I wanna picslip one of our save the date options!
@HisSweetheart_ I wish I hadn't known! It would have made it 10x better!
Mornings when I wake up in horrible moods, I run through a quick list of everything I have to be thankful for. Then I'm good to go.
@_SpoiledGirl People are so fucking salty over you being cold lmao. Maybe they could send you a blanket instead of being douche bags.
Officially have our save the date! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Thanking God for Diet Coke today.
@AnonWifeVanCity to flaunt them in front of everyone. lol.
@AnonWifeVanCity Cousin/bridesmaid wants to throw me one and I don't know how I feel about it. I mean, I want the clothes, I just don't want
Poll: Are lingerie parties tacky?
@stonecoldbetch Your life will now be changed forever.
@SimpleSpouse I'm the same way girl! If I DO get them, they're NEVER at the same time. It's totally random.
That's my new years resolution. (Is it too late for resolutions? Whatever).
I really need to start cooking at home every night again. We used to save so much money, and I really love to do it.
@SimpleSpouse I told you it was coming! lol
I'm still sobbing over this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>‚Äú@iH8TvvitterHoes: Story of when I got my ass whooped over my girl smh 
But I do have the pizza place on speed dial just in case.
I was nervous about C making me dinner tonight, he won't even let me in the kitchen to watch over him. But it actually smells delicious.
@Island_Wife SAME. OH MY GOD IM SO GLAD SOMEONE ELSE HAS THIS FRIEND. lol
Morning started with flowers, coffee and fresh bagels, now we're watching Parenthood until this evenings events. Perfect lazy V-Day <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@TheTexanVixen He has amazing handwriting for a guy lol
@ThatSimplewife Teach me your waaaaaysssss <WEARY FACE>
Can anyone tell me where The Last Five Years is playing anywhere near me? Anyone? @AnnaKendrick47 help a girl out.
@DisneyFiancee @TypicalWifey I'm still so sad about this <PENSIVE FACE>
@grownupbutnot Wait, what is this?!
JOHN CORBETT IS SARAH BRAVERMAN'S BABY DADDY?! YES. YAAAAAASSSS. #Parenthood
Joel on Parenthood &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so hot
@Island_Wife Same! I'm so psycho about other girls, and I know I truly have nothing to worry about. At least he can't say I don't care. lol.
@SimpleSpouse I would wait to see if you start soon, since they're so irregular. But if it gets ridiculously painful, make an appointment.
@SimpleSpouse TMI, but does it feel like...sore? That's how I get and I always know I'm about to start.
@SimpleSpouse I do whenever I'm about to start my period. I don't have them regularly, but when I do I feel a lot of pressure like that.
@CammieRichie Tina Fey is a goddess, and Jason Bateman is top of my to do list.
@MrsStudent1 And it makes me so sad to say that because I LOVE my ring. But they're just horrible there.
@MrsStudent1 Luckily nothing's fallen out yet, but multiple people have had that same issue so I'm just waiting for it.
@CammieRichie OBSESSED with that movie.
@MrsStudent1 Honestly, I would never recommend Kay's to anyone. Ever.
@MrsStudent1 NOPE! Multiple screw ups along the way (which resulted in me knowing he had bought a ring), and they barely apologized.
@MrsStudent1 For the headache they put him through (start to finish, ordering was a nightmare) we should have gotten a huge discount!
@MrsStudent1 It was essentially my exact ring, just bigger and the band had a few extra stones. They got mine and someone else's mixed up
@MrsStudent1 This happened to my fianc√© when he was ordering my ring, but they made him send it back <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Someone tell me what happens on LOST so I don't have to actually watch it.
@TheNewYorkDoll What is happening?!
This may be a dumb question, but are you allowed to have more than just your wedding party at your bachelorette?
@HisItalianWife You have nothing to feel guilty about. You did the right thing for yourself, that always should be your #1 priority.
@HisItalianWife easier said than done for most people. Stay stong. If you need to talk, I'm here.
@HisItalianWife Not that any of this is easy, but you should be proud of yourself for knowing what you want, and refusing any less. Much
What are/were everyone's wedding themes/colors?
I wish I was more computer literate so I could make my own spreadsheets and stuff for the wedding. Asking other people for help blows.
The only person I know who is planning one lives in FL, and I'm a bridesmaid in her wedding. So we talk a ton, but it's not the same.
I wish I had a friend who lived close to me who was planning a wedding too. I get so lost sometimes and I need someone who will understand!
@TheSpoiledWife 50 Shades, and then a ghost tour. lol.
C thought he had a speeding ticket due the 19th. It was really the 9th. Fuck.
Sobbed uncontrollably last night because my dog is going to die one day and there's so many animals in shelters. I'm losing my shit.
@spoiledbratprbz Horrible. Disgusting. Can never unsee.
@emilyrose_tcb did they take it off?!
WHY ARE PEOPLE SAYING HOUSE OF CARDS CAME OUT EARLY I DONT HAVE IT YET
@myinfinitybey He's for SURE taking advantage. Do you think if you actually turned him down for the extra money he'd kick you out?
@myinfinitybey to vent or talk I'm here!
@myinfinitybey Well I hope you guys can get out that situation! That's insane to me. I know we haven't really talked before, but if you need
@myinfinitybey You have no other options?!
@myinfinitybey Girl, you need to give him a reality check. From what I can tell, you have way too much going on to have to deal with that!
@myinfinitybey If he's that much older than you he should not be hitting you up for money like that! Does that happen often?
@myinfinitybey Jesus, who is your landlord? That's fucking ridiculous.
Our Valentine's Day is going to consist of seeing 50 Shades, and then going on a ghost tour. Clearly, I hate Valentine's Day. lol.
STOP SENDING ME PICTURES OF DOGS. WE CANNOT ADOPT A DOG RIGHT NOW.
I seriously love the days @Anon_Paparazzi announce cat fish accounts lolololol
How to accidentally kill yourself: Put a piece of gum in your mouth and then take a drink of a Rockstar. Instant death. So gross.
The people next to us thought we just got engaged so they started congratulating us. I didn't have the heart to tell them the truth, lol.
At dinner last night for my dad's birthday, our first dance song came on and my brother made C and I get up and "practice". I died a little.
WHY IS PLANNING A DISNEY TRIP SO EFFING STRESSFUL
C is seriously sending me pictures of dogs at the shelter that he wants to adopt. Not gonna happen.
@EOverload I LOVE him! He's so fabulous. Also obsessed with that Potion color.
Sometimes I just bust into my brothers room while he's in there with his girlfriend and make things uncomfortable. It's the little things.
Just watched my 49 year old father do a handstand, now stand up comedy on Netflix with my brother. Day instantly made better.
@LittleBrideLife This was one of our top choices for first dances!
@Princess_GF_ Same!
@DGCsays Literally exactly what I got from her post today. She's completely insensitive.
Waiting on vendor emails will be the death of me.
@futurefiancee Read the Crossfire series! I loved it so much more than 50 Shades.
@SimpleSpouse No! We watched it yesterday and I only flinched like once. And I'm pretty chicken. Lol.
@SkinnyNoir VERY. Lol.
Hungover on the couch with C looking at wedding bands and tuxes for the guys. I love lazy Sunday's.
@SkinnyNoir It's totally fine hon! No worries <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@SkinnyNoir And now I won't be eating for the rest of the day. Lol.
C and I went through two bottles of wine last night and I woke up feeling more hungover than I have in a while. My life is a joke.
@jackieproblems Seriously. You'd think this was my first drink. It's really sad actually.
Also my maid of honor just mailed me red velvet Oreos. I'm a happy girl tonight.
@jackieproblems Glass two of wine and my knees are weak. I'm pathetic.
Finally got some of our engagement pictures back! IN LOVE <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Shrimp scampi, wine, and Parenthood. De-stressing at its finest.
Exactly 9 months from today! So. Much. To. Do.  #HWedding
@SocietyBrunette I volunteer as tribute <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
I JUST WANT MY ENGAGEMENT PICTURES. SERIOUSLY.
@TheNewYorkDoll I think I'm on episode 5 and I'm so in love. I can't believe it took me this long to start.
@TheNewYorkDoll I just started today and I'm already obsessed.
I want Sarah Braverman's hair. #Parenthood
C is picking up Taco Bell for dinner because I refuse to get the kitchen messy after all the scrubbing I did today. Totally normal.
@SimpleSpouse Definitely beats my leftover Chinese lol
@SimpleSpouse that looks freaking amazing.
Just started Parenthood and I can already feel the tears I'm going to shed over this show.
@pa_angel_momma THIS. I feel you on this so much.
@SoFlaGrlProbz You're so cute!
@ModrnTrophyWife I understand 100% doll!
Just finished scrubbing everything top to bottom. Sit down to watch Hoarders, immediately feel like the apartment isn't clean enough.
We got home from WV around 4 this morning, currently bleaching the bathtub on my hands and knees. I have way too much going on.
With the stress of my gran, my mom being sick again, and just wedding planning in general, there has not been one single messy spot in days.
I've always been an emotional cleaner. Whenever I'm stressed or upset, suddenly the apartment fucking shines.
Anyone who is still able to find the @Febreze_Fresh Sugared Cranberry spray, please send me 50 bottles. I just ran out of my last one. Dead.
@thinnatic where can you watch it?
Could @queenscb teach me all about moons and signs? Interested but there's SO much.
@Classroomzilla Can I get in on this challenge?! I need someone to hold my ass accountable. Literally.
I'm crying I'm so happy. He knew it didn't feel right to shop without her, so he surprised me. I love him so much.
C BOUGHT MY MAID OF HONOR A PLANE TICKET SO SHE CAN BE HERE WHEN I GO DRESS SHOPPING THIS MONTH <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@EOverload Those bow platforms are amazing
@DisneyFiancee have a license.
@DisneyFiancee through his county, which is 5 hours away. So we just had a commitment ceremony. We said all the exact vows, we just don't
@DisneyFiancee No! We tried to get our license but where C is still technically a resident of WV and I'm not, we had to get a license
I'm just so thankful I had the chance to give her that ceremony before she passed. It was beautiful.
She had the hugest smile on her face the entire time. She even got the giggles at one point. It was the most alert she's been in days.
She asked me if she could be my maid of honor, and of course everyone was crying.
We aren't legally married because of a marriage license issue, but she got to see us commit to each other in front of God.
My grandmother is dying, &amp; her last wish was to see me get married. So, C and I had a ceremony today in the hospital. 
@LypstickJungle There will be 5 in total!
Edelman could get it.
@CityLifeLove Fucking stressful at this point. lol.
C had his very own wedding nightmare last night<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
We found a first dance song we BOTH agree to and love! Jesus must have been looking down on us this morning. lol.
Made a 'honey fund' tonight for our spare cash and change! I'm not very crafty, so I'm pretty proud of this. Lol. 
@bitchbrunette What's your normal lipstick routine? Primers, liners, stuff like that. I can never get mine to be perfect. Help.
What was everyone's budget when it came to hair/makeup? I can't decide how much is TOO much. #replytweet
Had a ruptured cyst last night. You'd think after multiple times of this, I'd be used to the pain.
@CoffeeCocktail What's with the crazy bruise on her ankle, first off?
Whenever my mom and I watch Intervention, she always cries if the grandma or a small sibling have to read their letters. Lol.
Making C watch Blackfish for the first time! Maybe now he'll see why I refuse to go to @SeaWorld on the honeymoon.
So. Much. Wedding. Shopping. Today.
I never realized it was possible to fall in love with dishes until I just found my flatware for the wedding. IN LOVE. I HAVE TO HAVE IT.
Running some wedding errands today! Trying to square away the catering and the rental place <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
The amount of money I spend on candles is a little disgusting.
This is why I have her as my maid of honor. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
This was a true eye opener. I'm ready to become a better person because of this.
I've lost two people who I really cared about because of my carelessness, so now my only option is to forgive myself, apologize, &amp; move on.
I hate the things I've done recently. But I'm using this horrible experience as a way to grow and realize right from wrong.
The worst part about this whole situation is hurting someone I never meant to hurt. I'm not the person who does this kind of thing.
Sometimes it takes something being thrown in your face to realize you were wrong
@MrsStudent1 So good for you! I wish I could do it.
@SimpleSpouse I'll start it with you doll!
@DisneyFiancee Photographer!
What do you mean you don't drink coffee how are you alive
@menandmascara What is it so I can report it? I can't stand that stuff.
@pa_angel_momma YAY! Congratulations! Praying for you! &lt;3
@blondthinbarbie I just don't wanna be THAT girl, who's freaking about a makeup trial 10 months before my wedding lol
Also, how far in advance is too far for testing some different people for makeup?
How far in advance is TOO far in advance for a cake tasting? lol.
But when I'm stressed out, all I want to do is stuff my fucking face. I'm going to be so huge by the time the wedding comes.
When I'm not stressed, I could go a day, sometimes two, without absolutely nothing to eat. As long as I'm constantly drinking something.
Woke up craving a Sierra Mist. I NEVER drink soda. So there's that. Waiting on my face to break out any second now.
@MarriedSouthern I've gained a SIGNIFICANT amount of weight with PCOS. Granted, not as much as her, but still. lol.
@Classroomzilla means we can't do ANYTHING, which isn't true. So I wanna show him we can still have fun without blowing all our money.
@Classroomzilla I LOVE this idea. I've been trying to think of something kind of like this for my fiance and I. He feels like budgeting
Thankful for C, who will stay up with me and watch the #SOTU without making fun of me. lol. Everyone else laughs at my interest in politics!
@Island_Wife That's all that matters honey!
@_ChicWife Basically someone pretending to be someone else/living a different life online than in reality.
Just ate my weight in Arbys. Fuck it.
@CohabitingGF Lmao, 'no bitch'
I will never be over Opie. Not ever. #SonsOfAnarchy
Hashtag don't talk to me
At least he'll play my little games with me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
The Office, Sons of Anarchy, and Boy Meets World are the three shows I could watch in constant rotation for forever.
Lol, my fianc√® is maybe a little too excited about getting Arby's tonight <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@SimpleSpouse they had to resort to using a doll lol
@SimpleSpouse I was literally just reading about this! lol. Apparently the first real baby had a fever, and the second didn't show up. So
@sparksandcake and start looking at other options, since it would be a near miracle if I ever became pregnant naturally. lol.
@sparksandcake That's fantastic :) I am unable to have children (at least my chances are pretty slim to none) so we've decided to go ahead
Beginning the long process of finding the pros/cons of both adoption and surrogacy. Praying we'll find what works for us!
@bear_with_bear Thanks. Because I give a fuck. Find someone else to bother.
Any budgeting/money apps you recommend? #replytweet
@_WifeInWaiting That's amazing!
I'M JUST SO IRRITABLE TODAY. SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
Starting my fast and meal planning on the same day was not my smartest decision -_-
@CityLifeLove That shouldn't be your responsibility.
@CityLifeLove yourself. Those other girls could see it as an excuse to get the most expensive stuff on the menu.
@CityLifeLove If you go, I would just tell the waiter that you're going to be on your own check. There's NOTHING wrong with just paying for
@CityLifeLove I HATE that. It's not fair for you to have to pay for someone else, which is essentially what you'd be doing.
But I feel like they could go days without talking to me, when they call each other constantly. And I don't need that in my bridal party.
It just sucks because I'm the type of person that once you're close to me, I care so much and I would do anything for either of them.
I'm still kind of new to them (we've all been friends for like 2 years) but still. So they care more about each other's lives than mine.
I think where I messed up is asking two girls who are closer to each other than they are to me to be in it. They've been friends for years,
So, moral of the story, what's the right way to kick someone out of your wedding, when you still have to see them everyday afterwards?
But even that seems like an inconvenience for them.
It's not like I've even ASKED them to do anything annoying or stupid. Everything I've wanted from them has been the fun stuff.
THEY SEE ME EVERYDAY. THEY SEE ME PLANNING MY WEDDING EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. AND THEY ACT LIKE THEY HAVE NO PART IN IT.
I'm seriously on the verge of just telling them never mind, because clearly they don't give a fuck.
They didn't say anything. I'm so fucking frustrated. I get no help from them. My MOH who lives 17 hours away has been more help.
They come in today, KNOWING I had my engagement pictures this weekend. Did either of them ask about it, ask to see pictures? NOPE.
They didn't offer to go dress shopping with me, they didn't offer to go cake tasting with me. Nothing. Not once.
Two of my bridesmaids are coworkers. They have not ONCE asked me if they could help with anything. They don't ask how anything is going.
I'm about to vent, bare with me.
OH MY GOD. I'M SO IRRITATED.
Slept horribly last night. C kept talking in his sleep, and accidentally rolled over and punched me once. I stayed up to protect myself lol.
Did anyone use Candy Warehouse for their candy buffets? Is it reliable?
I'm pretty sure I picked two of the WORST bridesmaids on the face of the planet.
We're the Millers, moscato, and spaghetti. Lovely night <PURPLE HEART>
@lovelykidrauhI <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è 
I loved having my friend here, but I am so exhausted. I'm ready for a good 10 hour nap.
Ten likes and I'll post one of the save the dates we had to choose from! <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Woke up DYING for some Arby's. Why is this happening <WEARY FACE>
#TweetYourLockScreens Natalie Portman in Black Swan. My constant thinspo. <PURPLE HEART> 
Antonia showed me a quick mock up of a save the date she made us last night, and I cried. Lol. I still just can't believe it's happening!
FUCK MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE WHAT THE FUCK PACKERS
IM GOING TO FUCKING SCREAM
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME THIS FUCKING GAME RIGHT NOW
THIS GAME IS GIVING ME A COMPLEX. LETS GO PACKERS FUCKING END THIS SHIT.
Oh. Also. My hair is super less purple after being washed 3 times. Now it's reddish brown/purple hint. I love it. 
Watching my friend edit our pictures and being like 'whiter teeth here' 'get those fly aways' and she looks like she wants to murder me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Engagement session- done! I'm so excited to see how they came out! Maybe I'll put a picture up once I get to 100 followers <SMIRKING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@DisneyFiancee ME. Always me. Lol.
Hair is less purple this morning, thank God. I think these pictures will be saved!
WHY AM I SO IMPULSIVE.
Correction: Sometimes I accidentally dye my hair PURPLE. THE NIGHT BEFORE MY ENGAGEMENT PICTURES.
Sometimes I impulsively dye my hair. The night before my engagement pictures.
@EngagedSass TOTALLY makes sense. I actually love the feeling. That's why I ended up with 5. Lol.
@EngagedSass I love it! So cute! How was it?!
@Island_Wife Isn't it funny how that happens? <NEUTRAL FACE>
Every time I'm with a friend from home, I always seem to dye my hair. Let's see how this goes <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@MarriedSouthern They're vicious when they pluck lol
@MarriedSouthern myself. No one touches them now but me. Lol.
@MarriedSouthern The worst! I learned that the hard way. Had to let them grow up, got them done by a really good girl, now I pluck them
@EngagedSass Let us know how you do! I wanna see pictures!
I specialize in leaving the house with a cute outfit, pretty face, and ratchet ass hair. Whatever.
Friends flight got delayed an hour <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
9:18 and C is up vacuuming. What is happening....
I GET TO SEE A LONG LOST BEST FRIEND TODAY AND IM SO EXCITED I COULD CRY
@EngagedSass I have 5 tattoos, and that was my least painful spot!
@EngagedSass to feel warm, you know how sometimes it can be kinda painful? It's that kinda pain. Especially in that spot.
@EngagedSass Not right away. You definitely feel it for a second. But it literally just turns into like...when you're super cold and you go
This heart burn right now is fucking terrible.
Someone tell me I made a good polish choice before I go back and change it because I'm indecisive. 
Just got home and was starving. Ate two graham crackers dipped in cream cheese frosting from the can. Whatevs.
My nail lady ALWAYS asks about my mom (just finished up chemo for breast cancer). She thinks she's just the cutest thing. lol.
That nail polish decision was seriously so stressful. ILL HAVE THIS POLISH IN PICTURES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
Um. I had an appointment for 3:15. Why isn't my nail lady here yet?
@EngagedSass My shoulder blade didn't hurt at all! Don't stress!
@EngagedSass feeling you get is pretty close lol
@EngagedSass here's the best advice someone gave me- start scratching your skin in the same spot for like 5 minutes. That painful numb
TOM HARDY DROPPED OUT OF SUICIDE SQUAD. BRB SOBBING FOREVER.
And I just really, really needed him to ask it today. Obviously I know he loves me, but that question shows it more than anything.
People who haven't gone through an ED have no idea how much that one question can mean to someone.
C and I finally started to make up. He texted me and said "I know how you get when you're upset like this. Have you eaten today?"
I'm probably most excited about the candy buffet at our wedding. Gonna go hard on that bitch lol
JUST REMEMBERED I HAVE A NAIL APPOINTMENT AT 3:15 TODAY PRAISE YOU BABY JESUS
You got engaged three days ago, and today you announce you're pregnant. I see what you did there.
2 caffeine pills, a Rockstar, and two large coffees later, I think I am officially having heart palpitations.
My hands are shaking SO bad right now
I can't even remember the last time I got nervous that I could be pregnant. I go 5 months without one without even testing lol
While other girls freak out about missed periods, us with PCOS are like 'yep. Just another day.' <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Island_Wife I'm here if you need anything!
@LadyEngaged SO cute!
Did you guys combine your money when you moved in together or did you wait until you were married? #replytweet
@Island_Wife little bit at a time.
@Island_Wife You can't think like that! Just trust your husband, and trust yourself, and know that you can get yourselves out it, one
I'm dying to see American Sniper.
@Island_Wife appreciate things and be responsible later, if I've had to go through hard times.
@Island_Wife we buy houses or have kids, then we're lucky we got it out of the way! I also like to think it'll help me teach my kids how to
@Island_Wife We're young, we have all the time in the world. If that means we're tight on money now so that we can live happily later, when
@Island_Wife Yep! I tell myself I'm lucky to go through it young, because that means that I have a fruitful life ahead.
@Island_Wife better, and that right now is just temporary.
@Island_Wife I know exactly how you feel. It will literally make you sick. You just have to try and remember that things will eventually be
@treschicbarbie Thank you! &lt;3
@treschicbarbie Right? He's a horrible person. Lol. And my fianc√® would never treat me that way. It's just my ED trying to get to me today.
@Island_Wife YEP. Like you can never actually get caught up. There's always something  to pay and never any money.
@treschicbarbie feel like he needed to treat me well.
@treschicbarbie He would basically tell me that I asked to be treated horribly because I obviously didn't care about myself, so he didn't
@treschicbarbie I have actually had it said to me. Not by my fianc√®, but by another ex. And it's really stayed with me.
@Island_Wife I understand 100% girl. Everyday is filled with stressing over how we're gonna pay bills.
This coffee is giving me fucking life right now
@Island_Wife I have those all the time. Money stress is the fucking worst.
She's also designing our Save the Dates for free. She's literally saving us SO much money. I could kiss her. lol.
All we had to do was pay for her plane ticket, which was only $140. So we definitely got an AMAZING deal.
One of my best friends from HS is a photography and graphic design major, and she's doing our engagement photos for free!
I think I'm gonna have to up my Paxil dosage until after the wedding because I am stressed the fuck out 24/7 right now lol
I refuse to be one of those brides who waits until the last second to do everything and then her planning is a nightmare.
He doesn't understand that if I wasn't stressing about this, NOTHING would get done.
Apparently now I need to "relax" about the wedding planning because we have 10 months. There are things that HAVE to get done early.
Maybe I ask for too much.
I know I'm better than that, I've been in recovery for almost two years. But I know today will have to be a day actively spent fighting it.
"If you were skinnier, he would never treat you this way"
Days like today, when it feels like C and I are two separate planets, are when my ED comes back to torment me.
"You and I are more than you and I because it's we". - E.E. Cummings. &lt;3
Two green tea caffeine pills, and a Rockstar. I'm about to kick today in the face. And then have a MAJOR crash later. But whatever.
AND today is the first day I've straightened my hair since I got it cut and it's fucking awful. So my day is terrible and it's not even 8:00
I hate fights like these. They make me doubt myself and our relationship so much.
So now I'm tired, and super anxious because we won't get closure on the fight until tonight because we both work today.
Fought &amp; argued, and he just rolled over and went to sleep while I stayed up because I can't sleep when we're mad at each other like that.
Well last night went just about as well as expected.
@ThatSimplewife One of my biggest pet peeves! It drives me insane. Lol.
I have to have tv playing in the background when I have serious conversations. Or sex. But I doubt sex will happen after this convo lol
Why isn't my damn Roku working right now
@wife_nextdoor OBSESSED with almond milk. You will not regret switching!
Gonna attempt to talk to C about our budgeting/money issues tonight. Wish me luck <NEUTRAL FACE>
It's disgusting. My hair smells like it from my pillow cases. I hate it here.
The people below us smoke in their apartment and it drifts up into ours. EVERYTHING I own smells like smoke and it's not our fault.
The plan was to move this year, but then we got engaged and decided to marry sooner rather than later, so we have to wait another year.
I can NOT wait to move out of this tiny ass apartment.
@MrsStudent1 I love it anyways! lol. Thank you so much!
There is no better feeling than having a home cooked meal on the table for your man when he gets home.
@MrsStudent1 TAL. Black, white and gold <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
...I accidentally sat down for two seconds and now I can't get up. Whatever. There's always tomorrow. 
So about all that cleaning I was supposed to do...
@DisneyFiancee Yeah. His mom is paying for the photographer, but that's it. And traditionally, his side pays for the rehearsal. But idk
@DisneyFiancee Is your fiance's parents paying for it or are you guys? We don't know whether to ask them to do it or not :/
@TypicalWifey There are days I would choose a mcdouble over an expensive 4 course meal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Challenge accepted. (Except not. Please help motivate me <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE>)
To do list: Eat this sandwich. Drink this huge ass iced coffee. Clean the whole apartment. Cook dinner. All before C gets home @ 5:30.
Got a long list of shit to do, because I'm fucking insane #remix
The sound of people whistling literally makes my skin crawl. Can't fucking stand it.
I have so much to do when I get home and all I want to do is nap for 5 hours
@DisneyFiancee don't have kids or are just choosing not to bring them on their own choice, not us having to ask. Which is nice. lol.
@DisneyFiancee Yeah that's a lot more than we'd have. We're mostly just inviting immediate family w/kids, our friends that are coming either
@DisneyFiancee We are making a designated kids table though, w/ crayons and coloring pages and stuff. To keep them out of the way.
@DisneyFiancee As much as I would like to not, we both have way too many family members with small children. It would be impossible.
All I've done at work today is tweet and pin Disney World tips and tricks onto my Honeymoon board. I'm okay with that.
@blonde_american TBH I called my fiance "my fiance" before I had a ring on my finger. He basically was anyways! lol.
@blonde_american This made me really giggle. lol. I totally get it though. Boyfriend just sounds so...temporary. lol.
@DisneyFiancee I mean, I'm gonna see him in like 4 hours. Why am I so upset about this right now. lol.
We're only separated when we're at work, but I'm having one of those days where I could cry I miss him so much. lol.
Even though we live together and are around each other almost 24/7, I still have days when I genuinely just miss my fiance.
....that's basically it. Those are good goals though right lol
2. Start hardcore budgeting and saving, not only for wedding/honeymoon but for everyday afterwards.
1. Lose 30 lbs by the wedding.
About to put down some goals for myself for the rest of the year. They say if you have them in writing, you're more likely to achieve.
One of my bridesmaids just got me subscriptions to Martha Stewart Weddings and Bridal Magazine! So sweet.
@BlondieRambles Exactly. Sex can mean nothing, but emotionally attaching to someone changes the whole dynamic of your relationship.
@BlondieRambles Agreed. A million times agreed.
Thankful for @DisneyFiancee who basically just helped me plan my honeymoon lol
@MittenMamma people like that who can just throw a precious life away! It's not fair at all. I'll never understand it.
@MittenMamma There are people like myself (and you, I've stalked your page lol) who have such difficulty getting pregnant, and then there's
@MittenMamma Disgusting! Stories like this make me sick to my stomach.
Have any of my followers been to Disney and/or go there often enough to answer some questions for me? #replytweet
@ProseccoAndPups THIS. One million times, this.
If you claim to be a "feminist", but then judge another woman's decision on how she lives her life, you are NOT a feminist.
I always dreamed of being a stay at home wife and mom to a household of kids, but there are so many things now that make that impossible.
Money stress is the worst stress in the entire world.
I was so excited to get to go get my nails done today, and then see my friend/photographer tomorrow BUT I HAVE A WHOLE EXTRA DAY TO WAIT.
I JUST REALIZED TODAY ISN'T FRIDAY. BRB SOBBING
Do you guys think dark nails or light nails are better for engagement sessions? I can't decide. #replytweet
I just wish I was gonna be skinnier for these boudoir pictures :/
We're getting our engagement pictures done Sunday, and then Monday once C leaves for work I'm getting a surprise boudoir shoot done!
It's not always rainbows and butterflies.
Like...back the fuck off me if I wanna come in and take a five minute coffee breather before I start my day.
And I'm attempting to plan my own wedding while still being home to clean and have dinner ready so C can come home and relax.
I work full time as a front desk manager at a hotel, I'm a full time (unpaid) intern to one of the biggest weddings planners in my area,
I don't think my co-workers understand how much I do in one day.
It's amazing how much clearer my face is after only a couple of days drinking just water and green tea.
Like what the fuck is wrong with me lol
Walked into work and said "sorry I'm late, my eyebrows took longer than usual" to my male coworker so I'm fucking done with the day at 7:00.
WHY IS MY CAR TAKING SO LONG TO DEFROST RIGHT NOW
@bridezilla_life No one has a budget? Lol.
Waking up late just throws my entire day off and I hate it.
@undergradwife Thank you! Yours is amazing!
@undergradwife Engagement ring! <PURPLE HEART> 
Inhale caffeine all day, can't sleep, take two klonopins to pass out. And repeat. Probably not the healthiest cycle but whatever works
Daddy actually had tears in his eyes when he said it was perfect <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Church got the seal of approval from my parents! So so so happy <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Literally counting the hours to my mani/pedi on Friday. I desperately need to relax and not speak to anyone for an hour. Or five.
@TheLovelyLady_ @G_Eazy My brother will be there too!
@Classroomzilla Oh you're fantastic! Thank you!
@Classroomzilla I'm in northern VA. We're getting married in a church, so they don't cater, but I can bring everything in.
@Classroomzilla My current project is finding a caterer. Which is way more stress than I thought it would be <NEUTRAL FACE>
@Classroomzilla Always. Constantly. Lol.
@DisneyFiancee What's up?!
@queenscb Yep! It's too pretty to take down yet. If it's still cold out, it stays up. lol.
Do any of you stick to a strict monthly budget? How do you do it? #replytweet
@Classroomzilla Oh I'm so glad it works! I'm mostly using it for my hair, but stronger nails would be a plus too.
@Classroomzilla Oh, you know. Money, work, planning the wedding. Just life in general. Lol.
So stressed right now <NEUTRAL FACE>
Plus I need it long for the wedding. Can't have a beautiful Serena Van Der Woodsen boho braid without super long hair!
Praying this Biotin I just started taking works wonders. Instant regret after chopping all my hair off!
@LadyEngaged That was my mom's biggest thing. She wanted to buy all of our cleaning necessities and then take me on my first grocery haul.
If I haven't answered your first 35976346 FB messages about buying Advocare from you, you'd think you'd get the hint. GO AWAY.
Oh and then I had some starbursts because I needed something sweet so I'm just fucking done today
@sparksandcake I'm sure they will have it...I'm just a little OCD and I need to KNOW it's there before I show up. lol.
HATE myself for the BBQ chips I just inhaled but I was starving
@HisItalianWife Oh God I'm so glad I don't or else we'd be broke as hell eating Hibachi every day, for every meal. lol.
@HisItalianWife By this point I think yum yum sauce might be in my blood. Obsessed. lol.
Taking my parents and my planner to see our church for the first time tonight! I'm so nervous they won't love it as much as we do.
@HisItalianWife SO. JEALOUS.
@MrsStudent1 festivals are so worth it!
@MrsStudent1 you just wanna kick back and relax. Definitely more of a scheduled, walking all day kind of thing. But the Christmas &amp; Blossom
@MrsStudent1 I totally understand! There are like so many different TYPES of vacation, you know? lol. DC definitely isn't the type you do if
@MrsStudent1 I actually adore DC! It's where my fiance and I got engaged! If you go during the right time of year, it's amazing.
He's lucky he's cute. 
@_ChicWife Thank you! I'm just so stressed right now that I can barely see the light at the end of the tunnel lol
297 days until we're married and all this madness is over. I can do this.
Why the fuck is food for a wedding so expensive
I love the housekeepers at the hotel where I work. I learn some new Spanish everyday. lol.
Whatever it takes.
"I don't think you have huge thighs. I think you have thick thighs". Oh. Thanks. Now I feel so much better.
@_SpoiledGirl It elongates your fingers, making them look skinnier! I've been using that trick to feel better about myself for years. lol.
And I know it SHOULDN'T matter what they think about it...but it does to me. A lot.
Mom, MOH, and Future MIL have all said no to it. Dreams crushed.
NO ONE LIKES THE DRESS THAT I'M OBSESSED WITH AND I COULD CRY RIGHT NOW
I think I'm the only girl in the world who really just doesn't care about Valentine's Day.
They have it online, but I want to make sure I can go in and try it on. #lasttweet
Is it okay to call the bridal boutiques you're going dress shopping at to ask if they have a particular dress in stock? #replytweet
I've gone through an ED and I'm trying my hardest not to let that come back while I'm working to look good for my wedding.
Like, there's an adorable line at Target that's all bridal stuff and I've told everyone numerous times how much I love it. Still nothing.
It may sound really bratty, but I'm actually pretty upset that NO ONE has gotten me anything that says 'bride' on it yet.
I wonder if I can lose 70 lbs and get a boob job in time for the wedding.
Engagement pictures this weekend and I am SO nervous.
Thankful for a job that I can just tweet and pin to my wedding board all day.
@LadyEngaged healthy snack options to bring to work with me, but I'm so nutritionally challenged lol
@LadyEngaged I'm really bad about not eating during the day, and then I get home and binge on everything in sight. I'm trying to find
@LadyEngaged Are you working out at all?
@LadyEngaged What are you doing to lose your weight?! I'm trying to get 'wedding ready' and I have no idea where to start :/
My wedding photographer is going to be on The Chew next week! So excited for him!
Does anyone know anything about these pills? Picked them up yesterday in hopes they'd jump start some weight loss. 
@MarriedBetch Have**
@MarriedBetch I PCOS as well! If you ever need someone who understands, I'm here!
@SassCollege Thank you <PURPLE HEART>
@_ChicWife <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@TheNewYorkDoll Omg me too! I want to go so bad but I'm scared to go alone lol
Hoping to get C to eat healthy tonight! Huge loaded salad, hummus, pita bread and celery!  We'll see how this works out lol <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
This traffic is fucking ridiculous. My planner loses her shit if I'm late for our meetings and this time it isn't even my fault.
@Island_Wife I go once a week. I love meal planning and shopping alone. It's my quiet time. Lol.
@societygrl It's not working as a link..?
Kicked my fiance's ass in Trivia Crack 5 times today AND I've lost 3 pounds so...I'd say I'm winning today.
My favorite thing is to sit and watch documentaries on Netflix. Currently on a health food documentary kick.
@sassproblems Like what?! It never makes any sense to me!
Days when I actually stick to healthy eating are literally the best days for me.
@CityLifeLove My life in one tweet.
I'm training to be a wedding planner myself, and I just got the catering contract for one of my brides. $18k plus some change.
I. Cannot. Deal. With. All. The. Camo. Weddings.
What are people's thoughts on grooms cakes? #replytweet
Fiance surprised me with coffee at work this morning so now I can hopefully have a good day.
@EstheticianBabe Is it on Netflix?
If I don't look like Amal or Angelina by my wedding day, I have failed.
She makes me so uncomfortable, she always makes me feel bad about myself. That is the last thing I need while I'm trying to find a dress.
Fiance's mother is now coming with me to dress shop -_-
BUT. She's renting us tables and chairs so we don't have to use the ugly ones supplied by the church sooooo I can live with that.
Up super late trying to describe to my mom the vision I have for the wedding and we clearly are not on the same wave length.
I DON'T WANNA BE AT WORK RIGHT NOW
@LadyEngaged Coupons . com always works for me!
@FierceAndLittle Everyday! Lol
@FierceAndLittle The upside is that the two days after we get to spend on the beach, so we made lemonade out of those lemons! Lol.
@FierceAndLittle YEP! We had to cut our honeymoon 3 days short <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@FierceAndLittle I've never been able to. That's why I'm in a wedding the weekend after mine,17 hours away <CONFUSED FACE>
Water and fruit all week so that I can look like I partially have my shit together before our engagement pictures this weekend.
Went to get a glass of wine and realized I finished it off last night without realizing. Cue sobbing.
Still contemplating if I want to do a boudoir shoot for C as a groom's gift...
The thing my fianc√® and I argue about most during wedding planning is the music. It's so important to both of us that we just can't agree.
Hoping baking cookies will make up for the housework I didn't accomplish today. Whatever.
And I'll do whatever I have to in order to get that <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Honestly I don't find anything wrong with being dubbed a 'bridezilla'. I'm just a woman bound &amp; determined to have the wedding of my dreams.
I seriously don't understand businesses that don't return phone calls/emails. If I'm trying to give you business you could at least respond.
This is basically going to be my personal journal to keep my from going bat shit crazy during this whole process
