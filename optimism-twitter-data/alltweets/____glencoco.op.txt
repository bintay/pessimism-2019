I'm on the verge of tears. The Bad Blood video is going to be so damn good.

@yelyahwilliams 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
Breaks my po' lil heart. 
I just hate that everyone doesn't feel that way. I hate that there are people who believe they don't matter or that they're unimportant.
I'm not very optimistic but I do believe we all have something to be thankful for and happy about. No matter how bad it gets.
I don't like it when people are sad or unhappy with their lives.

@_AllSmilesHere I just saw the tweet<CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Dang
Who is, ILoveMakonnen 
@QueenCaradine I enjoy learning about people too, more so by observation cause Im not a good listener. But I can def see you in that field
I sing my ass off when Suga Mama comes on.
I thought everyone gets drained from social interaction, introverts just get drained easily. <CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@QueenCaradine so you mean to tell me socializing isn't draining? Like that doesn't happen to everyone?
@QueenCaradine idk. It seems like it takes more to converse with them because you gotta search for similarities I guess.
@QueenCaradine I mean, that too. But i can't really explain it. Like it takes energy to socialize and old people require more of it.. shoot
Summer of Reformation. I'm claiming it.
@QueenCaradine energy. It requires a lot more energy to talk to old people.
I swear you learn something new EVERY SINGLE DAY.
@___MCoops yup! I think now more than ever, it's becoming easier for our generation to recognize &amp; truly understand the systematic forms tho
@QueenCaradine but you're more outgoing than I am. My introversion makes it harder to talk to older ppl cause I feel like they demand more
@___MCoops well, there's levels to it tho. Not all of it systematic. There are individual forms as well.
I can't make friends for shit.
@QueenCaradine 
@___MCoops I never knew what it meant until recently.. Like a few months ago recently.
@QueenCaradine or maybe I'm immature.
@QueenCaradine I have friends who r only a couple of yrs older &amp; @ times the age gap seems huge. Like we weren't in HS @ the same time
@QueenCaradine yea, cause even 3 years is a stretch for me. Cause life moves so fast between 18-25 those 3 years can make a HUGE difference.
The best friend is excited. The best friend misses me. 
@QueenCaradine that's a super stretch for me. I think at this age, it's hard to date someone 10 yrs older w/o seeing them as an elder
I'ma start calling everybody "babe" like Bobby in It's Kind of a Funny Story.
I couldn't think of nothing deep<CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@QueenCaradine uhhhhhhmmmmm.... Dating outside of your age group.
I have this huge problem with lying. Idk why. It's prolly cause Momz never brought back a puppy whenever she went to see a man about a dog.
I'm lying I just talked to Dee earlier this week I think.
I haven't had a deep conversation in a lil while...
Girl, let's have one 
More importantly, how is Chamillionaire? Is he okay? Does he need water?
How is Kristen Stewart doing? Is she okay? Is she happy?
I feel like writing but the words won't put themselves on paper so I'm good.
I'm honestly already thinking about graduation cap ideas.

Yea, my nigga cute!
My hair is too soft to lock. It has to be trained, and that takes forever. I just can't.
The phase when the locks don't quite lock... Yea, I'm not here for that.
Like I don't have the patience to go through the ugly phase.
But shout out to all the girls with locks. I want that life, but I'm really not about it. I'ma chill and let y'all do it cause it's cute.
Y'all really be giving other people power over you... I just can't. That might be a bad thing, but so far, it hasn't harmed me yet.
Yes Internet, drag these idiots.

Oooooooover it. Oooooooooover it.

Sex and Candy is honestly one of my favorite songs.
Who's that casting devious stares in my direction? Mama this surely is a dream.
Who's that's lounging in my chair?
I smell sex and candy here.
@___MCoops I'm not the greatest, but when it comes to extra ass shit like that, I know what I'm talking about cause it's interesting.
But there would be hella tweets about me eating cereal if twitter tweeted all the tweets you typed but never tweeted
@iSneezeTweets  
*there's... But there weren't enough characters for that
@___MCoops it's an example of polysyndeton. Im tired of my professors telling me it's grammatically incorrect when really it's no difference
That's my crutch tho. I'm good for using it in all of my writing. It's become my style
You'd see tweets like this cause it's been in my drafts for a while now @___MCoops

I'ma need my favorite baes to get together a put in on a ps4 for a real nigga.
But yea, I gotta slow down and put a little more thought into what I'm typing. I can't stand typos.
In all seriousness... As long as you aren't measuring your success by another person's standards, by all means, aim as high as you please.
That typo will not prosper on my watch.

@_AllSmilesHere Essentially it's all about what you're willing to risk. The higher you aim, the higher the stakes.
@_AllSmilesHere if it isn't what you want then it isn't success.
Been aiming low all my life, I don't know what failure is.

"@iSneezeTweets: Peeta thought he killed haymitch but with haymitch's liver, he was due at the gates at any minute"
Book 8: Haymitch dies after choking on one of Peeta's garlic bread bites. Can't say we didn't see that coming.
Book 8: Peeta has come out as trans. Haymitch returns to make fun of him.
Book 6: Peeta goes through menopause. This explains the mood swings and hot flashes.
Book 6: Gale is the father.
Book 5: Katniss is pregnant. Peeta gets morning sickness and mood swings.
Book 4: Gale visits.
Book 4: Peeta teaches their daughter how to cook. Katniss scolds him for instilling archaic gender roles. Takes her fishing instead.
The kids call Peeta by his first name. Sometimes he's the weird lady that lives in daddy's room, but mostly just Peeta.
@iSneezeTweets prolly would've smashed will too, if we being honest.
Katniss brings home big game. She sits out back skins &amp; cleans it. Peeta prepares it. Garnishes it w fresh basil &amp; serves it w French bread.
What the fuck is a Mellark anyway? Peeta Everdeen.
They should've let Peeta kill her ass honestly...
FUCKING PEETA'S "I can bake a mean sock-it-to-me cake, but can't hunt or tell the difference between poisonous and nonpoisonous berries" ASS
She sparked the rebellion, lead the rebellion, succeeded in rebellion, and now lives in Victor's fucking Village with Peeta bitch ass.
Her life was bad enough as is, now she gotta actually live with no purpose any more.
I honestly would've felt better about the Hunger Games trilogy if Katniss died at the end...

"Love" have y'all blind as hell.
Keep yo ass on a string for years, thinking he love you when really he using you. But y'all don't peep game.
That nigga don't claim you. He don't take you out. He don't cook for you. He half ass the sex... You just entertainment.
For real tho. You may be at his house 3 nights a week, cooking him dinner and giving him the best sex ever, but that's all you doing.
You're literally bragging about being "incomplete." Who is supposed to be jealous?
What fulfillment do you get from bragging about unresolved feelings for a person who has visibly moved on???

I'm not a rocket scientist, but he can't be thinking too hard if he with somebody else.

I personally don't want to murder anyone. But if I did and I was offered money for it, 10k would not be enough.

At the end of the day your crimson blood is RED. Just like mine.
I just get tired of seeing people at each other's throats over petty nonsense. It's everywhere, too. It's unavoidable.
Here's an idea. Instead of tearing people down because they aren't "on your level" how about you lift them up. Help them get on your level.
Why would you complain about a certain hashtag trending if you're just gonna add the hashtag to your tweet???? Counterproductive.
I'm done with Beyonc√©'s crip walk.
You are following macaroni niggas.. IM-PASTAS.

@_WEEZYTaughtMe_ When they find out their way isn't the only way, they get so offended. Be butt hurt cause you disagree with them.
Honestly, people are just rude... Especially when you disagree with them.

@ImFiesty_BiteMe there you go blaming me again. I'm doing the best I can and this is how you treat me!?
I think I made my first Twitter account when I was 13... I honestly don't know what for, but whatever.
I keep forgetting that it's like 12 year olds on here n shit. I wonder what middle school twitter looks like...
Just a few more inches til I'm at bra strap length.
I can't wait till my hair gets outrageously fucking long. It's damn near back to where it was in high school.
@ImFiesty_BiteMe you wrong for tryna turn it around on me<CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Nothing will ever get me like "meaty oaker" and "hall of cost" those were just.... When sounding it out goes wrong.
.....scent..... I just shed a tear.
How? 
I don't want to make any decisions that'll make them uncomfortable, so I leave it up to them. Cause I don't mind speaking up.
It's also cause I notice a lot of people won't really speak up when they're uncomfortable.
Everybody I was taking to dipped. When Chris tap I'm out.
I mean by definition I am passive, but that's only cause I refuse to take responsibility for other people's actions...
@_kingkairo np
I hate that "Well, you told me..." shit. I try to leave the decision making to everyone who isn't me.

"@iSneezeTweets: ‚Äú@____glencoco: It's tacky as fuck.‚Äùit's a heart..." It's booty is what it is.
It look like one of the rings that come on the Barbie cupcakes.
It's tacky as fuck.

@reuxzilla that last part is supposed to say, cause the new rate is more of an incentive than the current one.
@reuxzilla it's not. Cause ain't nobody finna extensively train you for $7.25/hr 
@reuxzilla are you saying that cause you feel like most minimum wage earners don't receive adequate training?
@reuxzilla if there was a supplement, it would be a gov't supplement for which you would have to pay for...
But let me get up and go to class and be productive.
But if the shoe ain't on your foot why should you give a damn, right?
It's honestly mind blowing to me, how insensitive and inconsiderate and inhuman people can be.
People who get paid minimum wage have to work so hard for those fucking pennies. Y'all tripping.
@reuxzilla it doesn't work like that for everyone tho.
You'd have an attitude too if you were getting yelled about some cold fries that you didn't even bag cause you were busy taking orders.
You'd have an attitude if you worked like a slave for 40 hours a week and never brought home a check that was more than $300
Y'all are a fucking trip. "The bitch at McDonald's don't deserve $15 to catch an attitude with me."
You are a blessing to my ears @JoJoistheway
I'm just in my bed crying with this song on repeat cause it's so damn good... It's a blessing.

I think too highly of myself to have someone who's actions tell me they don't think the same.
I love me way too much to be with someone who doesn't love me just as much.
I refuse to be with anyone who doesn't think as highly of me as I do myself.... If that makes since.
Truth my ass.
