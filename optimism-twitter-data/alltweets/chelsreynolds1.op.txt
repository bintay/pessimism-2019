Loved @ENTERSHIKARI since I was in year 6, i'm now in year 13 but never appreciated them as much as I do today. "We're sick of this shit"
#ThankYouEd - please don't blame yourself. You're a hero x
Look how happy and optimistic i was yesterday compared with how I look today, running on 1 hours sleep 
As if I wasnt having a bad enough day, I burnt my mouth on some chicken and now I have one of /those/ things on my tongue :(
DAVE CAMERON EDITION
PRIVATISING NHS
LMAO U CANT AFFORD TUITION 
If you were an idiot named chelsea, where would you put your bank details? Looked in all my drawers, and storage boxes???? No?????

@David_Cameron it's looking very dark, to me.
64% of the electorate didn't vote for the government we're stuck with. Great Britain. Democracy at its finest.
Save the #NHS from privatisation under #TTIP @David_Cameron 
The only thing making me okay right now is the prospect of pitch perfect 2


U know when me and cass sob in public bc ED
@Ed_Miliband you are my hero
The worst thing is Ed thinks this is his fault like he's been so bullied by the press for 4 years, it's NOT his fault that humans are gross
My heart is broken
@Ed_Miliband no it's not your fault!!!!! You are a genuinely good human who cares about EVERYONE in his country and you are my hero
Bye bye nigel farage u steaming pile of xenophobic shyte
@abbiemaeheath11 more people voted Nazi in 1933, doesnt make them good!
The 70th anniversary of VE day today. Supposed to be a day of pride, yet today i've never been more ashamed of my country
Is it me or does the world seem a bit darker, this morning? A little bit less hopeful.
Ed squared is over. I'm crying at the bus stop.
Ed Balls has lost his seat. Who will dress up as Santa in the Commons now? Conservatives are LITERALLY puritans. They've killed christmas
BYE BYE RECKLESS
@idroppedmybrain @iz_upton UNDOUBTEDLY
@iz_upton @idroppedmybrain RED JUMPER
You just want more money in your pocket and more money in the pockets of people like you 
Just says a lot about the country that so many people would rather have more money in their own pockets than to get a child out of poverty
Result would have been hella different had it been proportional representation
@idroppedmybrain soon as exams are over xxx
@dr0vemewild he won by quite a lot as well!!! And northfield and edgbaston still labour xxx
@dr0vemewild STEVE
Welfare- gone
legal aid- gone
Rich- richer
Poor- poorer
Housing- crisis
Charity-…
ACTIVISM IS THE WAY FORWARD FOR PEOPLE LIKE US
@dr0vemewild "LMAO" ?????!?!?! Lma-no
Good luck to us all getting jobs after uni, we'll all be on zero hours contracts, and we'll never pay off our uni debts.
The public have voted for what the public want. Just ashamed to share a country with people who think that millions using foodbanks is okay
Conservatives may have got most seats, but I think the SNP are the real winners of #GE2015
@alicex4x my babys :(
@alicex4x no x
The lib dems have been almost completely destroyed
@Ed_Miliband I am so proud of you
Yes!!!!!!!!! Selly Oak and Northfield still red &lt;3
@alicex4x by then we should have all Birmingham seats and the result of Mr Farage's campaign ;-) night x
@alicex4x i'm napping now until 5am ;-)
@casslikesthings my macbook is saying channel 4 is unavailable :( xx
@casslikesthings I just cant, I just hate him too much man :( i've gone back to ITV because Brian May's on there :)
I've gone back to channel 4, I'm just gonna have to put up with Paxman
Our politics class should have organised to do an all nighter watching the election as it happens because the coverage is so boring
ITV discussing the fact that Birmingham Northfield could go to the Tories.... To Rachel Maclean, really? Poor Northfield
Owen Jones is probably the love of my life
Paxman trying to do comedy is causing me physical pain
@abbiemaeheath11 we're jokes, at least we care about politics tho x
Me and @abbiemaeheath11 in sociology tomorrow ;) 
@_lannisters tyler is PISSING at this version of blurred lines ;')
@dunwaIl ilysm xxxxx
@dunwaIl a v close second like you nearly won it ;-) hahaha my saddo shirt ;) xxx
@dunwaIl second happiest moment of my day, I love ur face xxxx
My tally chart is perfect right now ;-) 
@abbiemaeheath11 I love you, we can just never talk about politics in the same room ever again BUT WE CAN WORK AROUND THAT ;-)
@abbiemaeheath11 me and abbie heath will never fall out she's my token tory friend x
There is no mood that cannot be cured by Peter Mandelson pulling funny faces
Thinking about the next five years 
People are obviously not taking poverty seriously, if you've voted Tory, you've endorsed child poverty today, it's as simple as that
@casslikesthings @idroppedmybrain we all have the same brain about politics xxxx
Dont know what i'd do without my brain twins @casslikesthings and @idroppedmybrain xxxxxxx
"We've had parties targeting working families, and what Ed Miliband's doing is targeting pricks"

@casslikesthings @idroppedmybrain WE'LL TAKE FROM THE RICH AND GIVE TO THE POOR
@idroppedmybrain omg this is perfect
@idroppedmybrain u and cass are my merry men xxx
@idroppedmybrain I like that ;-) xxx
This is just confirming to me that I HAVE to follow my dream of becoming Prime Minister, now. This country needs sorting out, big time.
Yougov exit poll much more promising
@bbc exit poll:
Con:  316
Lab: 239
LD: 10
SNP: 58
UKIP: 2

@YouGov exit poll: 
CON 284
LAB 263
LD 31
SNP 48
U…
@m0ntynavarr0 honestly this is what it has come to lol
I'll probably be a Marxist in 5 years time tbh lol
@casslikesthings for sure!!!!
If Tories get into power i'll spend the next 5 years volunteering in food banks, i've got a feeling there'll be millions more using them now
If the Tories win, the fight against them doesn't end. I'll spend the rest of my life fighting the inequality their selfishness manifests.
WELL DONE SNP, ALMOST A ONE PARTY STATE!!!!!!!!
Exit polls :-| at least ukip did SHIT
NIGEL SAUSAGE
Reminder to all gogglebox fans that it is on tonight
Love channel 4 but i'm gonna lose my patience with Paxy
@ZainabChohan I thought me and gemma told you NOT to vote this kind of thing?! ;) u crazy bitch, I love you x
@cavee_  
Selly Oak, Northfield and Edgbaston are due in from 5:00am onwards so i'm tempted to wake up early rather than stay up late????
@skyzeeexxx u r an absolute nutcase, just watched ur snapchat, 'DONT RUN FROM ME SULLY" you've got me cracking up :') xxxxxx
Democracy is beautiful, I feel so lucky. #IVoted
ITS TIME 
@_lannisters MISS THOMPSON WILL LET US NAP!!!!
@_lannisters ALL NIGHT
Aw I verbally abused my dad via text for being late home and he was being sick, i'm a nasty person (he has food poisoning)
HURRY UP LLOYD YOU DICKHEAD
My dad's gonna get punched by me if he doesnt HURRY UP I wanna vote man
Seriously though, did Lily Allen write her song "Fuck You" about UKIP?
If you vote UKIP you are disgusting :)
Happy birthday @catwinkles <TWO HEARTS>
VOTE

@steve_mccabe thanks steve!
Good luck to @RichardBurdenMP and @GiselaStuart too! I will be voting for Steve McCabe, and i'm rooting for you both, too :)
Good luck tomorrow @steve_mccabe my mum wanted to tweet you this, but her account is private. Here's her tweet: 
@idroppedmybrain history p3and4 ;) xxx
@idroppedmybrain things CAN only get better i'm sobbing
Tomorrow on my way to the polling station i'm gonna skip all the way and sing "THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER" to evoke the power of '97
Good luck to @SarahChampionMP in Rotheram tomorrow. I'm not from your constituency, but i'm rooting for you!
William Hague's voice makes me want to stick knives into my eyeballs and I know that someone's voice shouldnt put you off someone but JESUS
My period may hurt: but not talking about menstruation hurts more


@ZainabChohan  
I think we should all post pictures of ourselves eating food with an ugly face, to show solidarity with Ed ;-)
Why has my body decided to just give up and let me get ill this close to exams?
The fact that the Sun are bringing back the bacon sandwich photo shows they have no serious criticisms of Ed. A weak, desperate attack.
GWARN MAJOR 


LEGALLY BLONDE IS ON NETFLIX MY LIFE IS OKAY NOW
Our Velocity by Maximo Park used to be my jam
The only thing getting me through exams is the thought of all the books I can read FOR FUN, and all the booze i'm gonna drink over summer
I'm both happiest and most comfortable in my bed in my jim jams, with my fairylights on :)
I'm #NotVotingUKIP because many immigrants come to Britain to escape horrific circumstances in their home countries such as war and poverty
Lol <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Maria, say it loud and there's music playing, say it soft and it's almost like praying, maria, I'll never stop saying, Maria
The West Side Story soundtrack is the best thing that has ever happened to me

@casslikesthings 
Me and tyler are starting a series of videos called "politics with Tyler" we've filmed the first one, and I CRIED
@m0ntynavarr0 well this has made my life tbh
@m0ntynavarr0 i'm howling omfg. The common Jay Z attracts his mate with his very large lips.
@m0ntynavarr0 here we see the beyonce in her natural habitat of the red carpet... An absolutely beautiful specimen :')
@m0ntynavarr0 pissing myself u sounded like david attenborough talking about a wild animal hahaha
Speaking in our native tongue
@m0ntynavarr0 I sobbed a little bit jesus christ
Beyonce's met gala dress, oh my GOD let me love you 
@_lannisters do you like the added red marker?
I'll have to wear a hoodie in the polling station tho
@_lannisters i'll put a hoodie on :(
I shall be sporting this home made tshirt on Thursday 
@_lannisters HAHA DONT BE EXCITED ITS SO SHIT XXX
@_lannisters okay I will. I'm just going over the letters with a marker ;-) I KNOW aw absolute bae xxx
Thanks but no thanks 
@bisialimi you deserve it! Thank YOU for all the great UKIP-busting work you've been doing ;) x
Made me smile to hear school kids on the bus talking about the general election. Even happier to hear they're future @UKLabour voters
Adding @bisialimi to my list of General Election 2015 Heroes! A very inspirational guy x
#GetTheToriesOut 

@idroppedmybrain ITS ALL BULLSHIT RO I JUST DELETED MOST OF IT
I've done loads for my history task but what does any of it mean?!?!? 
@iz_upton  
What a difference 10 years makes, bro 
We have a full household #votingMcCabe
Pussy Riot episode of House of Cards is fav
We need more people being vocal in trying to make britain work for the many, not for the few.
With a few days left before we vote, my GE2015 heroes are @OwenJones84 @twcuddleston @Ed_Miliband and a last minute edition, @rustyrockets
@rustyrockets you are a hero. :)
I might not agree with everything twcuddleston has said, but she's brought young people into the focus this #GE2015 so she's a hero to me
Louise Mensch is just a parasite. Find something better to do than find holes in a 17 year old girls activism.
This was me from the age of 8 onwards 
Tbh i'm still sobbing over "you didnt see that coming?"
If Coulson can come back from the dead and end up with basically his own show, I can have hope that Pietro will return
HOW DARE YOU 
how DARE you 
How dare you 
We should celebrate young women having a political voice regardless of party alignment. Why is Mensch so keen to bash down @twcuddleston ?
BrAP 
@skyzeeexxx hahahaha we say that the boy from the Jewish fam looks like Ty! Xxxx
Hoping to see many #plaidcymru posters around and about in beautiful Wales today
JUST READ A HOUSE OF CARDS SPOILER I'M SO PISSED
@dr0vemewild roaring
Where is Doctor Kate, my necklace is SO tangled up @_KatieeLouise
I've eaten two slices of bread all day. How i've survived without killing someone is beyond me.

@dunwaIl :-| so does the rest of the world, what's wrong with me?!

I'll never be okay again because Natasha told Bruce she adores him
Me and Tyler whilst watching Avengers 
EVERY AVENGER IS MY FAVOURITE AVENGER
That was incredible
Tbh I feel like I need a lie down
Where's ikra I need Ikra
"I adore you" NATASHA
P.s. Thank God for Aaron Johnson
I'm not saying I cried at Age of Ultron but i'm no longer wearing mascara so go figure
@_lannisters what about wills etc can they?

@idroppedmybrain @chelsreynoldsx HA omg bae'!!!! Why is he so cute, I love him xxx
Happy birthday @abcoops1 !! X
Happy birthday sprog @iz_upton love ya x
You could have a ring on her finger and 8 children with her and the media would be like "aw gal pal"
Gal pals, man, pisses me right off
Imagine Kristen Stewart is seen getting "touchy feely" with a man they'd be like BOYFRIEND but bc she's with a gal, they're like, GAL PALS
"GAL PALS" is the dumbest shit the media has ever come up with, just say it, just say they GAY it's not a dirty word ffs
No i'll spend my life crying 
Mum on the phone to Steve McCabe: "i'm 90% sure i'm voting Labour but there's 10% of me that's not 100%" 
I'm sobbing hahahahahahaha

The Milibrand interview was so good
Ed Miliband is incredible
Brand has backed Miliband. Not sure at this point if that will be a blessing or a curse, but I like Russell and Ed so i'm optimistic
It's too cold for no jacket but too warm for a jacket
@Kinsellalala we cried so much omg
Panic at the Disco was for sure one of the best gigs i've been to, i'm listening to Memories and I miss @Kinsellalala

#BaltimoreRiots  
Disaster for George Osbourne - economy weakest since 2012 less than ten days before a general election?! #VoteLabour
There's only so long u can be beat down before u fight back - it was only a matter of time before this happened. #BaltimoreRiots
How many black lives are lost before state listens and acts to end police brutality?Sometimes violence is the only way to make them hear you
"Riots are a symptom, not the disease" 
Don't forget that the Media is part of the disease.  #BaltimoreRiots
@ilhammmay hahaha I miss our form, dancing with Ketterz. That woman was a legend ;) x


This song reminds me of @ilhammmay in form at swans ;)
Love that Bruce Jenner made the distinction clear between sexual orientation and gender identity by addressing the "is he gay?" question
@LacieAllTimeLow my love and your love x 
The fact I received this from my GP says a lot about the state of the NHS under the Tories #VoteLabour #SaveOurNHS 
as a society, we HAVE to make sure that no more children have to wait until they're 65 years old to live as the person they feel they are :(
It breaks my heart that Bruce Jenner had to wait until the age of 65 to live authentically
Proud x 
@idroppedmybrain PERRY!!!!!
I'm such a good big sister 
I love that the majority of my politics class are either voting for Richard Burden or Steve McCabe depending on their constituency :)
That Obama video from the Whitehouse dinner thing is so funny
I don't feel like any club in Birmingham is ever gonna live up to NG1 after last night
@ng1club R Kelly Ignition please for Charley's birthday :) x
@ng1club IGNITION!!
WHY am I gonna get the fattest ever spot on the night i'm going out when I never ever go out
Bruce Jenner is quite incredible and hella brave.
We've had such a good morning and all we've done is wonder around I really love Notts
WE MIGHT GET TO MEET THESE CHILDREN 
WE MIGHT BE GOING TO A KITTY CAFE LIKE YOU HAD TO BOOK SO WE MIGHT NOT GET IN BUT WE'RE GONNA TELL THEM ITS CHARLEYS BIRTHDAY AND BEG
@charleyriley97 NO ITS NOT
U know when they're doing a quiz in the pub and one of the questions is about Ed Miliband and you lOSE your shit
Selfie #1 
What a splendid day i'm having
@ilhammmay I think it's your birthday today???? Happy birthday baaaaaaae!! Miss you so much and love you even more, have a good day xxxxxxxx
Grandpa no stop this is not a funny joke 
The Island is the highlight of my week @BearGrylls
In just over 3 years i'll have a degree in history and politics, like i'll have an ACTUAL qualification in the topic I love so much &lt;3
We vote for who we think will act for the greater good of Britain, and everyone in it. Not for who is the "coolest" 40+ yr old man
I dont see how criticising Ed Miliband for not being "cool" works, David Cameron is hardly what you would describe as "cool" either??
Thanks to my bff @casslikesthings for giving me this badge. First time voters reppin' @UKLabour  #Labour #VoteLabour 
The price u pay when you prefer eating mcdonalds to working out :-| 
@idroppedmybrain show him what you've got bc I know ur good at sound and lighting and all that stuff that I know nothing about ;)
@idroppedmybrain glad u like it rosie morgan ;)
Not a single leaflet from the tory candidate, that says a lot about how much they care (or dont care, more like) about my vote. #VoteLabour
I am in massive danger of seeing people from secondary school right now, this is getting risky
Getting to kings heath as all the school kids are leaving, do I hate myself?
Going to politics class now bye
Just because Murdoch knows he wont be a phantom prime minister if Ed gets in, he's scared
(the answer is no)
Murdoch is evil, the biggest reinforcer of a capitalist, exploitative system on the planet. Would it be a shame if News Corp shut down?
This isn't a warning, it's encouragement to vote Labour. Companies like News Corp are the bloodsuckers of the world.

@m0ntynavarr0 I AM ABOUT THAT LIFE
Definitely just changed my twitter handle to edward milibae and i'm not even ashamed
My face when people talk shit about ed at school 
Why do I still call Tyler by kid brother, he's taller than me
I had a dream that my next door neighbour kidnapped my kid brother
Just saw a picture of Ringo at the rock and roll hall of fame, and I genuinely thought it was Bono for about 10 minutes
I did my eyebrows in the dark today i'm so sorry

Dont tell me Kevin Spacey is dead when he is not, that is a cruel joke

My mum's a cretin she just nearly killed me its not even april fools
You can see the floor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (this is my fav corner of my room) 
I just cried so much at the woman's performance of Somewhere Over the Rainbow on Britain's Got Talent. A true survivor, so powerful x
I had a really scary nightmare :'(
Frank Underwood just looked me in the eye and turned my soul to ICE i'm genuinely terrified
This is turning into some next Walter White shit
What just happened I fell off the sofa
Oh my GOD house of cards????!!!! Oh my GOD
@m0ntynavarr0 <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Not even an exaggeration to compare her to Hitler in this sense - read her piece. You will see what I mean.
Sickened by Hopkins' latest rant about something she evidently doesn't understand. Sounds like it's been pulled from the pages of Mein Kampf

Six years ago today since I saw @Pink im concert. Soooooo need to see her again x
Listening to Tom Jones to try and cheer up lol
@m0ntynavarr0 i've had to pause my HoC marathon now because i'm too disturbed :(

Frank why are u removing ur fingerprints from Peter's car? Why are u doing that Frank?
Nah frank nah
I am heartbroken I hate House of Cards. I still have 20 minutes left of this ep how much worse can this episode get??????
Everyone in House of Cards leads a double life
So invested in Peter Russo and i'm scared
Charley. The episode just started.
Gonna start using this picture of Patrick Stump to summarise my feelings towards tiny animals 
@m0ntynavarr0 I'M GONNA PUT IT ON AT 22:30
@m0ntynavarr0 ohmy GOD

@m0ntynavarr0 I felt personally betrayed
This is a train wreck
Actually i'm more upset that he had a drink
Russo noooooo dont cheat on ur girlfriend she's cute :( :( :(
The thing is, Claire is actually in love with this British man, but no way is Frank in love with Zoe
House of Cards is all that currently matters to me :')
How could you look each other in the eye?
I hate Claire and Frank's relp, I dont know how you could allow each other to sleep with other people and then come home and share a bed
Zoe Barnes' face made me howl...opened the front door and the wife of the man she's having an affair with is stood there, she's like :-|
Congressman Russo is so important to me
@idroppedmybrain 
Who do I hate more: Piers Morgan or Nigel Farage? (the answer is I think they are equally as Devilish)
@dr0vemewild she's a beg!!!!
@_lannisters look at tony blair's fsce i'm crying
@_lannisters THAT IS US HAHAHAHA
@_lannisters omg imagine the spitting image skits u could make about us
I think i'd enjoy being a spin doctor??? I could be Peter Mandelson???
Mum trying to be punny: "Nigel went too Far-age" :-/ :-/ don't give up ur day job
@_lannisters HAHAHAHA
@_lannisters u knew I meant Peter Mandelson from the way I laughed :')
I genuinely dream about me and cassell running the country
@_lannisters that's what we are ;)
When ed asked david to debate him 1 on 1 me and mama rach looked at each other and then burst out laughing
@_lannisters NO CASSELL NO U CANT SAY THAT WE'RE THE DREAM COALITION, ME AND YOU
@_lannisters :/ not a fan :/
@_lannisters I dont like her i'm so sorry I feel like i'm betraying u, I just idk :/
Gonna keep my Sturgeon comments to myself because i'm not a fan :/
Not opposed to a Labour/SNP coalition but realistically the only ideal govt for me is majority Labour
Farage humiliates himself just by turning up lol
CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION, NICOLA IS GONNA SHIT HER PANTS
Bennett sounds like one of the seagulls from Finding Nemo when she shouts over people

HEALTH TOURISM DOESN'T COST US, STOP SCAREMONGERING
I actually just woooped at Leanne Wood's comments about unions
No one cared about borders and immigration when the British Empire was prancing about sticking flags in countries. Funny that.
Immigration hasn't put public services at great risk. The Tories have.
I am so proud to be a woman, goodness gracious me
GO DIMBLEBY
Farage is a dispicable human being. A pound shop Enoch Powell.
Am I a Milibabe??? Yes. I am.
<ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE> <ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE> <ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE> <ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE><ROSE>
Watching Farage talk is like watching an episode of Spitting Image. He doesn't even need to be satirised, he's a joke.
Britain deserves better, and it will be better with #Labour
Considering I spent the morning being jabbed at with a needle by a phlebotomist, i've had a GOOD DAY
The only good thing about having to have a blood test this morning was that @michellevisage was on TV in the doctors' waiting room!

Please help support Labour, add a #Twibbon now! 
Stupid human being.
"Where's the money you've pledged to put into the NHS coming from, George?" 
"idk but Miliband betrayed his brother" 
Oh thats okay then?!
Tories' personal attacks on Miliband's character prove they are a desperate party, having to resort to desperate playground digs
I've lost weight and i'm putting it down to the fact I haven't had a lunch from Kays in approximately 6million weeks

Chris Traeger is very important to me
Theres a fat tarantula in the hallway and my dads asleep so he cant catch it :(( barricaded the spider out of my room 
With the exception if kids with health problems where weight gain is a side effect (e.g. Katie Price's son Harvey)
Like really if ur kid is poss gonna die because of what u feed them, thats as abusive as if u punch them in their face in my opinion
If ur child's health is affected by the food that u feed them and the lifestyle u teach them, u should be treated as a child abuser
U r absolutely 100% not allowed to put 'dyke' in your insta bio if ur straight, that is 100% annoying

The Coming Out episode of Tofu was so lovely and so inspiring
and that's not just the opinion of a single person bc even when i've been in a relp on valentines day i've thought it was bullshit :')
valentines day is the biggest bullshit man, capitalism sucks
cucumber and banana are even racially diverse, as well as being really lgbt positive, legit my fav shows in such a long time :D
Kristen stewart is everything

@casslikesthings cucumber is fab this week as per. half way through the ep :) x
Freddie Fox causes me actual physical heart pain
Praise jesus hallelujah 

When I was little I thought @stephenfry was sitting on a booster seat in QI but now at age 18 i've finally figured out he's just tall :)
Gonna spend my evening watching QI, Cucumber, Banana and Louis Theroux docs :) :) :)
"@Independent: Bear Grylls made a very dramatic entrance on This Morning  
"@Independent: Nigel Farage is OK with seeing your breasts if you're a model 
The year twelves are so huggy why do they all hug each other

@Tylikesyoualot because ur a moron
@m0ntynavarr0 focus on your big toe :/
@m0ntynavarr0 it was soooo jokes every little thing was funny :') I had my eyes close and I could just feel u shaking with laughter :') xxx
Nah that sleepy session today was so jokes
I need to get into a relp with someone rich and generous quick time
I've got no money for the summer now like what am I actually gonna do

How do u feel chels? 
Ms P told us to go on strike and we were like miss we've already lost the job hahahahaha I love her

Better Call Saul y'all
@awbuckyno exactly, it proper annoys me when people think there's some sort of hierarchy :( xxx
GWay tweeted condolences to families of murdered muslims in the US and someone was like 'WHAT ABOUT FERGUSON' and it pissed me off :')
Than the murder of Iraqi/Afghan/Syrian children by the man who sits in the White House.
In the same way, maybe I might make a comment about how vile it is that ISIS burnt a man alive, doesnt mean I value that issue more/less (1)
Doesn't mean i'm not thinking about it :/
I've kept up with news on Ferguson religiously, but haven't tweeted about it for months because I don't think 140 characters is enough
Just because u tweet about a current issue doesn't mean u value it any more or less than u value other world issues
'u cant tweet about the murder of 3 innocent Muslims, r u forgetting ferguson? r u forgetting 9/11? r u forgetting hurricane katrina?'
Why is it that whenever u talk about an issue people go on like 'wait whut r u forgetting [insert separate issue here]' and its annoying
@gerardway people are always gonna find something to criticise you for. Rise above, g :) x
FFS THE WALKING DEAD :'(
After avoiding spoilers since MONDAY I'm finally about to watch the walking dead, I cannot believe I have pulled this off.

Does anyone feel like punching George Osborne in his smug twat face?
Inside the House of Commons is so interesting.. People camp outside offices to get Private Members Bill slots :')

THE TRAILER MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA BE A SHIT MOVIE ANYWAYS LIKE ON THE SAME LEVEL MAYBE WORSE THAN TWILIGHT &gt;:(
I SWEAR TO GOD IF I SEE ONE MORE ADVERT/ARTICLE ABOUT 50 SHADES OF SHITTY GREY I'M GONNA GO MAD
Jay Z's face when Kanye walked on stage AGAIN at the Grammy's was the funniest thing i've ever seen he was like 'nah not again' :')

Extreme - More Than Words: 
WE'RE WATCHING A MOVIE THAT HAS KATE MOENNIG AND SEBASTIAN STAN IN IT I'M CRYING
@AaronDrapkin I think good old Voltaire got it spot on with his 'i detest..' spiel. Though I read somewhere that they're not even his words!
@AaronDrapkin but as ever, I completely understand and respect what you're saying. Wish more people expressed themselves as you do! :) x
@AaronDrapkin why cant they just accept that we have just as valid and intelligent opinions as they, and move on? Rattles my cage, mate :')
@AaronDrapkin without ppl writing an article like 'ah they disagree with my opinion bc they're homosexual and they feel left out' :') (3)
@AaronDrapkin and its their human right to have that view, i'm not saying they can't. But why can't people like me express their opinion (2)
@AaronDrapkin I get what you're saying. Even ppl i'm friends with and went to school with, are inwardly homophobic bc of their religion (1)
Why can't they accept that like their views on why God exists are valid, Stephen Fry's views are just as academically valid? (bc they suck)
'perhaps stephen fry felt excluded by the church and by God because he is a homosexual' PERHAPS UR A CLOSED MINDED DICK FACE

@AaronDrapkin 
@AaronDrapkin i'm not sure when atheism became a crime 
@AaronDrapkin can say what they want but if someone suggests god might not be real (yet doesnt out right dismiss the idea)everyone flips (5)
@AaronDrapkin that get away with their disgusting views. seems to be that moderate religious people (not talking isis level offensive) (4)
@AaronDrapkin disgusting views that go unmentioned and unnoticed. Just like there are some people who are antisemitic, islamaphobic (3)
@AaronDrapkin which explains why they're frowned upon, but there are SO many homophobic religious people that get away with having (2)
@AaronDrapkin I know that not every Christian says things like that and Westboro Baptist Church are a publicised, extreme example (1)
AS revision is sickening, why am I doing retakes
@dr0vemewild glad to hear ur a fan of my modelling days xxx
@iam_mardybum this just made me laugh for a good ten minutes :')
Like just piss off.
Stephen Fry didn't even express himself in a disrespectful way, yet Christians are allowed to say 'death to fags' and stuff like that??
Why is it that Christians can say whatever they want, and then the minute Stephen Fry says something against God they all lose their shit?
@lorastyrellss I was a mess
15 year old me thought i was so cool.
15 year old me was so wrong 
These two photos sum up me as a 15 year old. 
Life was hard. 
Difficult to pick sides when I've got both Welsh and English blood... The Welsh in me is strong though, as I'm sure @fiyerno will agree :-)
all the welshies who work for my dad have just text him to say they're going home bc they feel ill etc etc...suspicious #WalesvsEngland :')

I don't give a shit what anyone thinks, I value HUMAN rights, and ISIS aren't human - anyone who can burn a man alive in a cage needs to go.
Two less ISIS/Al-Qaeda bastards on the planet is never a bad thing. Worried that ISIS will step up their game in retaliation, now.

BECAUSE THAT IS A BIG DEAL, AND AN INCREDIBLE THING
Does this 'three-parent child' thing that's been voted on today in parliament mean that gay parents could have biological children together?
Not that it bothers me in the slightest, I just know who to avoid like the black plague :-)

What else can you do but forgive people?
One of the girls who left Westboro Baptist Church is now running a campaign to help LGBT people in Jamaica, soooo much respect for her
In conclusion being transphobic is OLD and OUTDATED and HURTFUL so let's just get rid of it
+ to use the headline 'Bruce Jenner is becoming a woman' is not the right way of wording the transition Jenner may or may not be undergoing
and if Jenner hasn't confirmed preferred pronouns, the media should use 'they/them' etc until it's confirmed bc misgendering is so damaging
@PerezHilton so why are you referring to her as a 'he'? Make yourselves aware of the harm misgendering can cause, dickheads.
Team Reynolds has raised almost £200 with our sober wayz

From the ages of 2008-2013 I didn't really have friends but had bands instead. lol
MCR and the Used were both incredibly important to me, so I think a lot of the time I created little friendships between the 2 in my head
Maybe that was just me idk
I feel like if u were an MCR fan in 06 u were automatically a fan of The Used and had 800 theories on 'why g + bert aren't friends anymore'
