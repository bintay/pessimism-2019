@BlockNLoad Gonna check that right now!
@BlockNLoad BTW, my email used to do 5 games is the same used for my RS account, so is there a way I can get my account won't allow emails?

@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord My only thing to brag about is catching Lugia in a premiere ball on SoulSilver lmao
@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord I have played yellow, silver, emerald, diamond, soulsilver, Pokemon Rangers (first/second), and Pokemon Colosseum.
@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord Lol? A problem? How is that one old?
@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord Last one I played was SoulSilver.
@RuneScape 2008. The summoning skill got so much hype!
@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord Their audience isn't the same as it used to be. And no, because I don't have a 3DS. They can't please everyone though
@TinymaffyRS @Vyrelord I got of the loop with Pokemon. Now there is too much and probably not going back. Don't find it as fun anymore <CONFUSED FACE>

@BakingBadrs @CazzRS I know, but the boots are OP so I can safely predict that feathers will still be hard to get to not ruin normal agi.
@CazzRS Yeah, just look at any price in the GE, fluctuation is crazy hard to predict right now.
@CazzRS  When the minigame comes out everyone will have a chance4boots. I think the feathers will be hard to get, just says it's possible.
@CazzRS And since the minigame won't be released for a couple months the price is going to go back up. Get em while they're low!
@CazzRS I would try to get some now while people are panic selling because of the minigame spotlight.
@CazzRS Congratulations!!! <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>

@RSNZoee Nice header. <OK HAND SIGN>
@Vyrelord @JagexBeno Can you shed some light on the teamviewer app and the reason it is allowed/prohibited? I think it's okay to use.
@_JusticeRS_ Good luck! May RNGesus be in your favor.
@Vyrelord The device is allowed. It's actually playing Runescape on a phone or tablet. Idk where I can link you to the approval though.
@TinymaffyRS Hey! Be glad it wasn't worse. You could have accidentally brought something valuable!
@Vyrelord I did hear that top egg collectors used teamviewer and maybe he had nothing better to do. Gotta be first in something eventually <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

@Fractus_RS You can't always assume common sense in Runescape. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> They've messed up tool belt additions before, with clue  scroll items.
@Fractus_RS They ever confirm that the perks of the sec are still there? Or just cosmetic?
@IzzyRNG To the tool belt I mean. #LT
Anyone know if adding the v2 farming tools is worth it yet? <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>

@Bexi__ Will there be cake? :p
