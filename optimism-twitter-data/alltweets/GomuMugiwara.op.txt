#CloseEnough
@Optimistic_Gon “Way!”
@Optimistic_Gon “Someone stole all!”

“He's the reason we have no meat!”
@AshuraKenshi “You don't scare me!” Lowering her tongue out just a bit more, she was brave enough to taunt the annoyed man more.
“THERE'S THE MEAT THIEF!!”
@AshuraKenshi — out at him.
@AshuraKenshi “Only grumpy ossans break nets and tell their captain to starve.” Turning her head towards the pick whilst poking her tongue —
@AshuraKenshi “There's nothing to do after you broke the net… Grumpy Ossan.” She then pushed herself to sit up and crawl off.
@AshuraKenshi — wooden. “Zoro, I'm bored… And hungry… Bored and hungry. Bory, hungred.”
@AshuraKenshi “Yea… Shiny…” Apparently her face was planted in the floor which obviously blocked out her vision of anything other than —
“LIES!”
“MEANIE ZORO~!”
“You're meeeaaaann!!”
HOLY RAMEN!!" Laughs on the floor. 
@AshuraKenshi — Groaning while allowing her body to slip down on for her to plank on the floor.
@AshuraKenshi Resting her head on the rail out of boredom turning her dark voids towards the male, locking her gaze. “Hm!” —
“You did that on purpose.”
Jk. Dodged that.
Dies.
Places an apple on her head.
“THEN OPEN YOUR EYE!!”
“AWESOME LASER~~!!”
“Meanie Zoro's.”
@WhiskeredBlonde / that female kakashi tho

dayuuuummm
“Mean~”
@FlameFlameAce “No, I'm starving~!”
“You're mean! Not me!”
@AshuraKenshi — fright. “Why'd you do that?” A childish pout was shown on her visage.
@AshuraKenshi — from the ship's wooden flooring to leaned over the rails of the ship watching the net sink and the fish swim off in —
@AshuraKenshi Her expression swiftly changed into a blank one after he broke the net out of annoyance or anger, whichever. Pushing herself —
“I'm not mean!”
“Lies.”
“You're mean!!”
“You broke the net…”
“Zoro's mean……”
@AshuraKenshi — PIG AND NOW THE FISH!” Losing her footing and collapsed onto her back still laughing her guts out.
@AshuraKenshi — the scene the captain gave an outburst of her uncontrollable laughter. “PFFT! AHAHAHA! FIRST THE — 
@AshuraKenshi Turning her head over her shoulder, her onyx voids met with the fish sticking to his face before it dropped. After witnessing—
“THAT WAS AWESOME! DO IT AGAIN, ZORO!”
@AshuraKenshi — busy crew mate without thinking. “I bet I can get more.”
@AshuraKenshi — that wiggled in her grip after she brought her hand back above water. “Got one!” The captain then threw the fish at the —
@AshuraKenshi Placing her palm a good distance from her face before quickly poking it back into the water, successfully caught a fish —
@AshuraKenshi — “Hurry up before the fish swim off!” Rushing back over to the edge of the ship to lean over the rail looking into the water.
@AshuraKenshi — untangle. “OI! Zoro, cut the net!” She decided to give it up and throw the net over to the male cleaning his blade. —
@AshuraKenshi “We both can do it.” Lapping her bottom lip over her top whilst struggling to untangle the net which gave her hell to —
"The ghost lady is weird..."
@capnstrawhat394 Glomps.
Groans. “Zoro and everyone sleeps late.”
“I missed last night. Eh…”
@AshuraKenshi — “Found it, Zoro!” Picking up the net and jogged back to the male. “Dunno it was there.”
@AshuraKenshi Narrowing her large onyx optics that scanned the deck multiple times, her eyes just noticed the thing she was looking for. —
@AshuraKenshi was**| — right in front of her, a yawn then emitted from her mouth.
@AshuraKenshi — “Eh… Where is the net?” The childish captain obviously became too lazy to search for the fishing net that sas clearly —
@AshuraKenshi Running off to fetch the net like he commanded, only to halt in her tracks in the middle of the deck scratching her head. —
@SanigouShefu “I can get the meat.” An unintelligent person like their captain shouldn't be trusted with getting anything dealing with food.
@AshuraKenshi — “Oh yeah... The net~!”
@AshuraKenshi — dropping her sandals in front of her feet whilst rubbing the back of her neck again and released a nervous chuckle. —
@AshuraKenshi Before she even got the chance to throw her footwear into she froze to think about the net he mentioned a few seconds ago. —
@SanigouShefu Taking notice of his furrowed brow while tapping her chin until she shrugged her shoulders. “I got nothing.”
@AshuraKenshi — her feet to throw them at the fish.
@AshuraKenshi — continuing to throw random objects into water until she was out of things to throw. “RRAAAGGH!!” Removing her sandals from —
@AshuraKenshi Hopping from the edge of the ship to land right beside her first mate, still raging. “I can't get the stupid fish, Zoro!!!” —
@AshuraKenshi — do was stomp her feet and flail her thin arms up and down.
@AshuraKenshi “DAMN FISH!!” As much as she wanted to jump into the ocean at them she had to restrain herself. Only thing left for her to —
@AshuraKenshi — It wasn't too long until the female raged out by throwing whatever she could find around her into the water at the fish.
@AshuraKenshi Meanwhile at the edge of the deck, the captain was still struggling on getting at least one fish into her palm. “Come on…!” —
@FlameFlameAce “Where are were going again…?”
@AshuraKenshi — the ones she caught managed to slip out of the fingers which caused the captain to childishly frown.
@AshuraKenshi “Okaaay~!” Reaching both arms into the deep blue in attempt to grab some of the medium sized swimmers below. Unfortunately, —
@AshuraKenshi — Joller Roger looking down at the fish passing by. “FISH!”
@AshuraKenshi Waving at the male's quick departure she also brought herself to her feet and scampered off to sit on the edge of the —
@FlameFlameAce Finally reaching in front of the male, she nudged him with her foot.
@FlameFlameAce Whistling at the sound of her sandals colliding with the pavement, soon giggling after.
@AshuraKenshi — her gapped mouth, taking a look around her vicinity. “Is there gonna be an island soon?”
@AshuraKenshi “I dunno!” A shrug accompanied her sentence along with a silly smile left behind. Sitting back up and released a yawn from —
@FlameFlameAce “Yep!” Picking herself up to resume walking beside him.
@FlameFlameAce Catching the shirt with her fingers, she pulled the short over her burnt vest.
@FlameFlameAce “I didn't bring any extra shirts!” 
@FlameFlameAce “Stop burning my clothes up!”
@AshuraKenshi — onto the floor continuing to laugh at the male's interesting reactions.
@AshuraKenshi Laughing during her rage look a complete idiot while rubbing her nape. “Yep! That's all I care about!” Resting her back —
@FlameFlameAce Now sitting herself in the middle of the road with a frown shown on her face.
@FlameFlameAce Pivoting on her heel to take off the opposite direction while somehow dodging the flames thrown at her.
@Fi5h_Boy15 “Thank ya!”
