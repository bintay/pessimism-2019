Actually cannot wait to start my new job, need to meet new people.
@TomBlott fir degoe.
So we should've had a peno fir degoe tripping Coleman, but where was the blatant handball clip from the first half motd?
Rugby tackle Robbie Savage? You having a laugh?
Fucking hell, deflections off an inner thigh and a hand, had no luck today whatsoever.
Backed Plymouth at HT to win the second half, what a lucky bet that was.
@EHarper95  Do Yannick these jokes or are they your own?
@lucyefcf1 yeah,had his heels clipped a couple of times
12.45 kick off and travelling from Nottingham.. No lie in for me then.
John Carver "I still believe I am the best coach in the premier league"... Why John, why?
@nicholson_sam doesn't sound too handy, that, mate.
Just seen cctv footage of a guy being knocked out unconscious, in City Centre, plenty of people about, no one rushed to his aid, disgraceful
@TomBlott called it.
Get in, got myself a job at Toby Carvery, this is what I needed. Over the moon.
Barcelona odds on tonight and Bayern 4/1 - Two years ago Bayern beat Barca 3-0 at the Camp Nou and 7-0 on aggregate. Crazy odds. 2-0 Bayern.
@MorganjMasters am I right in thinking this was THE night?
Applied for a job yesterday, phone call today, interview tomorrow, buzzing. Hopefully its the start of a new chapter, need a change.
Having a meltdown and sharing on it on twitter what an utter twat I am
Even works shit, no one my age there, everyone just bangs on about getting a job like its a piece of piss, yet there's nothing out there
Worst of all it's same again tomorrow, and the Wednesday. Fucking load of bollocks. 1 day off n I cant wait to get back to work
Todays just been such a shite day, barely done anything, so fucking boring and lonely, I hate it.. Really hate my life sometimes.
Days off are actually shit.. Jealous of everyone at Uni, livin' the 'uni life'.. Working with a limited social life is beyond shit now. Cba.
I don't think the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge understood that Charlotte, Elizabeth and Diana were 3 separate suggestions..
Good job I don't give a shit about the fight with work tomorrow morning
Nedum Onuoha's had £30k on Liverpool hasn't he?
Its bad enough that we're 3-1 down,but a timeline full of people misspelling 'Cleverley' makes it worse.
@TomBlott fucking hell nearly a cracking shout.
Imagine if Mcgeady came on and scored the winner
So wish I was at Villa Park right now
"Rodgers out Rafa in" flies over Anfield.Liverpool 0-1 QPR. Fer.
Cmon Everton,show me why I've renewed my season ticket
In March I was kinda looking forward to Derby away next season.. Ah well.. At least Leicester will survive.
@PierceBramley @MorganjMasters With all them former Forest players as well, McCleary rubbing salt in the wound.

"@Smudge_96: Remember when lazar markovic went on university challenge and said hapax legonemenon 
Everton 3-0 Man Utd shown after a 0-0. MOTD discuss Man Utd with/without Carrick as well as the Europa league affect on fitness. What a joke
35% possession and counter attacking wins us the game 3-0. In the Xmas period we were having 60-65% possession and losing. No coincidence.
Hate Chelsea, lucky bunch of cheating twats.
MOTD2 ARE STARTING WITH A 0-0 OVER A 3-0 OVER UNITED? WTF.
@nicholson_samChrist... bet that makes you feel like bill 
Other than a few bellends for the minute silence, those Man Utd fans were incredible today, fair play to them
Fantastic win. Fantastic atmosphere. All tops off a fantastic weekend.One word summary?Fantastic.

@TomBlott is that right @nicholson_sam ? ^^^
Worse thing about last night was it was the 3rd time.. Didn't learn from my mistakes. A Mistake is only a mistake if you make it twice.
If I go hard then I need to go home.Such a lightweight its embarrassing.
Nothing worse than being told by your parents that they're disappointed in you.
I thought my 18th wouldn't be beaten but last night topped it. I need to know my limit.

@andycardwellefc ahh thought you were gonna buy me a pint :(
@andycardwellefc ahhh damn I was having fun as well, is that before the Burnley game we'll win 8-0? #ambition
@andycardwellefc what you on about? I want Guardiola but its not gonna happen. I don't like RM or BK but thinkin we could get Klopp is silly
@andycardwellefc yes, thinking klopp is an unrealistic target makes me a 'Kenwright Shagger'?
@andycardwellefc hahaha #shots #fired! #sorry I've not got any #ambition and im just a #realist. #DeludedLad
Is this Roko lad a new signing for Man Utd ?
@andycardwellefc are you off your rocker?
@BracewellsBoots Before today Everton had won 4/25 with Barry starting and 4/5 without him.. No coincidence that.
@BracewellsBoots well a groan maybe, but when there's a simple pass on or even a long ball available, a misplaced short pass is groan-worthy
@BracewellsBoots @grandoldteam @blue_nose_amy @jaynetoffee that's cos everyone else was picking their jaws up off the floor
@nicholson_sam doesn't help with Brendan saying top 4 is highly unlikely, and you'd need a lot of luck, whilst looking suicidal
I do a love an upset and close relegation fights but today's results didn't help this bet I had in July. 
@nicholson_sam bellerin has more goals than Balotelli in the PL this season. 4pts out of 21 vs top 4 for your lot and didn't beat us either.
What on earth was Moreno doing for that 1st goal @nicholson_sam
Ahhh Match of the day, Liverpool battered, wonder goals and an Everton win, sound that. <OK HAND SIGN>
The same guy has been pronouncing Distin and Mirallas incorrectly since he started.
The stadium announcer actually said Shinderlin and just mumbled Djuricic. Fucking useless, that kid who announced our subs was better.
@Everton sack your Stadium announcer. He can't pronounce any foreign name. Djuricic, Alderweireld, Gazzaniga, Eljero Elia, and Schneiderlin.
Great win today but will be forever baffled by Roberto's team selections and substitutions..
@GavinBuckland1 yeah a few stats
@GavinBuckland1 ahh fair enough
@GavinBuckland1 you actually have my dream job, any statistician jobs you know of by any chance?
"@GavinBuckland1: EFC with Barry 19% (5/26) in team and 80% (4/5) when out" that's inc today's win, staggering stats, take note Roberto.
@GavinBuckland1 great stat yet again, very interesting. Do you have the same stats for Gareth Barry?
Heavy Queues for City and McDonalds, twat of a taxi driver, up in 4 hours... Fuck.

@EHarper95 what happened?
@Vivek77Parekh L I F E S T Y L E
After banging on about Wales' "total domination", I informed my Dad of an offer on SkyBet... He ignored it...bad call 
Weird celebration by Kane though, body-checking the official next to the goal
You don't have a record like Harry Kane's if you're an average player.
In the last two games we've conceded 6 goals from 8 shots on target.. Get Robles starting again, fucking joke.
@Ged_Robinson don't know but its bloody annoying
On a positive note, WE SCORED FROM A CORNER.
@SomeEvertonFan assuming you mean out, agree 100%, hasn't played that well since coming back from his Injury
Anyone who is to naive to see the flaws in RMs tactics can fuck right off
My reaction to Gibson playing no part tonight whilst Gareth Barry plays the full 90 minutes 
We were shit (in defence) but absolutely robbed - by ref and pure luck.. Their 5th was a fucking stunner though
Feel absolutely distraught.Never expected it before kick off, definitely didn't at 1-1..  Too many individual errors for their goals.
Should've had a peno, hit the post twice and they've had 7 shots on target
Besic for McCarthy omfg
This ref is a fucking joke
@Squawka cracking assist the way it hit yarmolenko
Everyone blaming Alcaraz, the whole back 5 have been shite, just his mistakes have been costly
People saying he should've made no changes from Sunday, that's impossible dickheads
That 2nd Kyiv goal was atrocious from the corner to the goal, their players should've been fouled in build up
Alcaraz 10/10 on Sunday.. Fucking shite tonight
This is embarrassing
Very nervous, just want it over and done with, come on you blue boys!
Quite confident we'll progress tonight then hopefully meet Club Brugge in the next round
@EvertonTha Joel (But it'll be Howard), Coleman Jags Alcaraz Baines Mccarthy Gibson (but it'll be Barry) Atsu Naismith Barkley Lukaku
@Joeeeeeee_96 didn't get that at all from your fans, would they have booed had we not clapped Jonas Gutierrez too?
This triangle shit is pointless,no matter where the 3 players are, the shape it forms is triangular... Analysis for the sake of analysis.
@Goodison_Road yep.. A card, present and maybe breakfast does it for most
@Goodison_Road spot on. People actually get a buzz from likes and nice comments on all that shit..
McCarthy and Gibson have to be our first choice DMs after today especially
No Barry - EFC 3-1 QPRNo Barry - EFC 3-0 NewcastleJust saying.
No Barry = 3points (NB=3P)
Alcaraz MOTM, this guys deluded 
1 winger again... Why? Naismith dropped... Why? Stones not starting... Why?Give Atsu a chance over Lennon as well...
Lukaku has 3 against newcastle for us so far.. fancy him making that 4 today
Heading up to Goodison today, need the 3 points more than ever, COYB #EFCvNEW
Lovely bit of composure from Bamford for the 1st followed by a decent strike for the second.. Cracking player.

Jagielka was brilliant second half too, although Barry continues to be absolutely shite.
Lukaku 10/10. Best game in an Everton shirt?
"@OptaJoe: 1 - This is the first time that Howard hasn't been the worst keeper on the pitch in the 2014/15 season. Shock."
Barkley Barry Alcaraz Coleman and Garbutt have been fucking atrocious. Naismiths goal saved him from that list.
Playing shit; Howard, Coleman, Alcaraz, Jagielka, Garbutt, Barry...Oh you see where this is going.
Does Garbutt ever block crosses?
Not arsed about alcaraz playing in the absence of Stones, Barry on the other hand... Fucking abysmal.
The winners of Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, are ranked 11th in the world. Costa Rica 13th.
Just informed the mother that I'll be watching Everton on Sunday instead of a mothers day meal.Safe to say she's not too pleased.
Everton the only English side to reach the quarter finals in Europe would be craaaazy.
Everyone at works hates me and I've done nothing wrong, sound.Need a new job even more so now yet there's nothing out there!
this could be the greatest turnaround if schalke get another
@EHarper95 I did not
@EHarper95 ?
@EHarper95 who've you got?
Cmon schalke! Real Madrid look terrible!
Had a 'dream' that Martinez had been sacked and replaced by Christian Atsu, fucking weird.
Was up like every 10mins from 5-7 this morning
Haven't had a decent nights sleep in so long
Just woken up from a nightmare in which I was being strangled and struggled to breathe when I woke up, scary that.
Rangers just made it 2-2... Was so close to cashing out ffs 
@blairmcgregor1 thought so, cheers mate <THUMBS UP SIGN>

If we don't win either of our next two games and then lose at QPR we are really in the shit. Lets get 3 points tomorrow @Everton
Get the fuck in.Won £200 at Bingo. Relief.
Fucking Udinese cost me £176 in a 6 fold and Everton cost me in a £105 double. Infuriating.
Got to feel sorry for spurs, Chelsea get all the luck, as per
Shows you how shit the PL is with Arsenal 3rd, United 4th and the record of PL teams this season in Europe.
Look at Forest, played shite for a few months, sack Pearce, bring in Freedman and all of a sudden they're on fire, cant stop winning.
Gibson coming on 81minutes too late
Get the fucking ball forward ffs everton
Mirallas off, Lennon on? How about Barry or Besic off? Fucking hate Martinez
Remember the Barkley that dribbled past 4 and scored and St James' Park?He was good, him.
As for John Stones, massively overrated.
Too slow, no support, not closing down, refusing to shoot, passing backwards.Martinez do you not see this? Fucking shite.
@J_tizzle96 this is shite
Shite team selection, no Gibson? Clueless Martinez.
I'd start Robles Coleman Jags Stones Baines Gibson McCarthy Besic Mirallas Naismith Lukaku tomorrow. Just know shithouse Howard will play
@GavinBuckland1 fantastic stat
Think we can get a result tomorrow, providing mirallas and Gibson start, you know Howard's gonna fumble one in though.
Hearts 10-0.. The opposition have been well and truly CowdenBeat
@PeterDickie1994 better than having Brentford Derby and Mk dons...

Going to Stoke away on Wednesday, absolutely buzzing.

Everton, Ajax, Zenit, Sevilla, Wolfsburg, Fiorentina, Besiktas and Napoli will progress
@bradyates_ 
Here we go with the draw, reckon we'll get Inter
Whoever we get I think we'll progress, weirdly confident.
@PeoplesClub1878 97*, his hatrick against Luxembourg for Belgium was scrapped as their was a breaching of FIFA rules.
Don't want a Ukrainian or Russian side, want to avoid Wolfsburg too, despite our record against them.
@Ged_Robinson well, they drew 0-0 with Anderlecht, but still one to avoid, wouldn't mind Sevilla though.
5 of the 8 teams who dropped into the UEL after coming third in their UCL group, have fallen at the first hurdle in the UEL. Interesting.

Don't ever change your mind at the bookies once you've marked your selections.. Cost me winning £40...
@SomeEvertonFan blatant lie. Their offices close at 5.
"im not hungry" isn't an acceptable response to "why haven't you made some dinner for yourself?" according to my mum. Prick.
"@iphillips_efc: Howard may have played well but at the end of the day he's cost us yet another goal" PLAYED WELL? what game were u watching
@EHarper95 Phil Neville?
@EHarper95 he's a cunt.
Martinez, Howard,Barry, Naismith, Coleman, Jon Moss and BTs camera work. The list of things / people who have been shite tonight.
Naismith playing like he's worth every penny at the moment.We got him on a free.
@JoshTFarrell and amazingly commentators pundits and fans alike don't see it, Howards shite.
Howard doesn't collect anything in the box. Hazard nearly scores from 3 yards whilst Howard is on his line. Gets away with it once again.
Where is the Coleman of the last few seasons?
I've been to two derbies, a shite 0-0 and the Wembley semi final a few years back,my luck eh.
Its not like Howard's  scored a 94th minute winner at Stamford Bridge before...
Done with complaining about Howard replacing Robles but not really arsed as long as we come away from SB with something...
Paul Scholes, David James and Michael Owen. No enthusiasm. Utter,utter shite commentators/pundits. #BTSPORT
Wtf. Why did bt cut to an excited girl on pitch side who has robbed the microphone
Premier league, what's the score?Premier league, premier league what's the score?Wait, what?

Sunderland 0-2 QPR.The Redknapp effect.

@nicholson_sam ...
@TheRoboDon I meant fabregas, was just a typo
@DaveMarshall9 oh yeah, I knew that as well...
Hazard, Oscar, Costa and Willian will run rings around Gareth Barry tomorrow, not looking forward to it.
Disappointed with RM's decision regarding Howard, again having a different opinion to 90% of the fans.
Forever regretting the past, who I was and what I've become
Ffs That Ivory coast keeper's a twat, was hoping Ghana would win that..
Krul, Obertan and Perez to blame
My dads got 2-0 Newcastle in a bet, them misses have killed him aha
@nicholson_sam 


Rather frustrating travelling up from Nottingham to see a 0-0, after doing the same vs west Brom couple of weeks ago
As for RM's approach with a defensive formation, playing for the 0-0, bringing alcaraz on for besic in the 83rd min, disgraceful management.
Result definitely more important than the performance in the derby, although, I saw no improvements or positives today. Two poor sides.
McCarthy, Barry and Besic... Why change it now Martinez??
Arrived in Liverpool for the derby, hate waiting for kick off. #COYB
Fantastic pace and pass by Welbeck, Giroud miss-hit and a great finish by Özil, good start to the #NLD
My first ever Derby at Goodison, lets see scenes like this again #COYB 
@nicholson_sam 
Could do with the £20 I've withdrawn from my bet victor account too
Forever waiting for pay day...
All this last Merseyside derby for Gerrard shit is gonna look a bit silly if we meet the shite in the Europa
Keith Lemon is shite
Equatorial Guinea trailing 2-0 and all I can think is that the lead is Ghana improve for the opposition. #AFCON

Bolton were asking for that, again trotters fault for not closing the shit twat
Trotter coming on for Clough was a bad move by Neil Lennon, trotter's been shite
@TomBlott fucking idiot falling asleep and missing your stop
The second I close my eyes the bloke next to me on the bus stands up to get off... Typical.
Cannot wait for 5.30, then relax with 2 days off before the Merseyside derby, buzzing for it

"@TrransferNews: I'm told @Aaron7Lennon will be an Everton player by the end of the night. #EFC" 
@comber77 I understand and agree with your point but I think we have more depth in the CB position
We won't sign Winston Reid, he's overrated anyway, too many fans getting excited over a rumoured enquiry... Not even a bid ffs.
@comber77 yes, with Howard and a distin-jags partnership, mixed with our style of play. With Robles and Jags-Stones we've been much better.
Imagine Cahill, Pienaar, Barry, Distin and Osman on the same pitch. That pace tho
Just me thinking CB (Winston Reid) isn't the immediate priority? Winger needed. Mcgeady, Pienaar and Atsu aren't good enough. #EFC
Well that was massively overhyped.
Impressive yeah, but her singing's shite.
Right, lets see what this Super Bowl hype's all about, Seattle Seahawks (-4) handicap, come onnn!
Can't understand anyone wanting Howard back in goal for the derby if he's able to play, Robles has been 10x better.
Bellerin looks class
Ffs Guzan I had Arsenal 3-0 you cock
Result more important than the performance today ahead of the derby, lets hope we hold on and West Ham sneak a win
Cmon Everton, lets upset the odds, and get a win, please.
@Georgeblott ahhh the best, blasting that out all day
@Georgeblott shocking game that, how about this for a memory though, rating is bullshit.. 
So we won 2-0 at Wolfsburg, Bayern are 4-1 down, Everton &gt; Bayern, right?
What a game this is #WolfsburgVsBayern
@EvertonRecords remember this game @Georgeblott ?
@amieelol I hear that a lot, m8.

Had so many problems with my car and when I think its sorted I get a flat battery and cant fucking start it with jump leads, so frustrating.

Chelsea 2-0 Bradford City 

Ramires has doubled the lead for #CFC. Comfortable win on the cards?

#FACup
It really has been a shit day, stressed, pissed off, life is really fucking shite atm, don't enjoy it one bit.
34 year old wanting to try for a baby with a 61 year old... Fucking sick.
Fucking despise these people on these benefit programmes, 40 yrs old, never worked, yet gets by, smoking 30 a day, cunt - country's a joke.
All these 'people' on these benefit programmes, complaining their benefits aren't enough, whilst smoking and owning a dog or a cat... Twats.
Ahhh love a good cup upset
Points taken off West Brom this season: 4

YES, PROGRESS

*a single gunshot …

It has finally hap…
If Barkley tried and it wasn't working then fair enough, but there's no effort or urgency from him, pathetic performance tonight.
Baines needs to insist he takes that peno tonight, that's the underlying worry for me.
Bill Kenwright either sell up or get a permanent role on Corrie for a bit more <HEAVY DOLLAR SIGN><HEAVY DOLLAR SIGN><HEAVY DOLLAR SIGN>
Booing may not help but we are entitled to boo as fans who pay ridiculous amounts to watch us not get behind West Brom's defence even once.
The biggest positive from tonight was a whole 3 corners beating the first man haha we are shite.
@EFCStats I'd take orders from her any day
@Britishboy1997 right back at ya British boy
I travel up from Nottingham to watch #EFC - splashed out on a season ticket and I get 2pts from games vs Hull, Stoke, Palace and West Brom.
@Britishboy1997 yes we only bought him in July so why sell him? Unlike Barkley he's playing well occasionally - more potential in Lukaku..
@Britishboy1997 so what - keep him, playing shit game after game, then hope he improves? His value decreases every game he plays.
Need to sell Barkley, another shite performance tonight, cba to hear Everton fans defending him again on here #EFC
Cannot wait for the @Everton game tonight, confident of 3 points! #EFCvWBA
Buzzing for tonight's game, confident of 3pts for the first time in a while, must win game #EFC #COYB
Fantastic win that for Arsenal, Santi Cazorla was magnificent, as were the other 10 who started for Arsenal, great game.
Cue all the Forest fans "Stuart Peace, LEGEND." After all the hate...
After no bets in 6 days, a personal best, gone mad and put 4 on today
Tweet no. 3000 - of which a good 2500 have been about football, ahhhh im a sad bastard.
Miss having Sky Sports badly..
Haven't had a bet since Saturday... Temptation is unreal.
"side ne- ohhh no, its in, shane long" oh dear..
@EFCStats two stone wall pens?! Neither were even fouls...
1 Joel Robles
2 Kevin Mirallas
3 McGeady is suspended

Negatives
1 Out the cup
2 McGeady only …
Decent banter from Salardyce though
Half expecting David James and Mcmannaman to rip Sam Allardyce's trousers down and start licking his arse
Gotta focus on the Europa League now
If it was Howard in goal we would have lost about 4-2 set, Robles was fantastic
Drained, absolutely drained.
@JoelParker_1878 nice one mate...
@JoelParker_1878 too early to be making labels like that...
Kevin fucking mirallas
Swarbricks a twat, fucking homer
Get the fuck in
Besic?! Fuck off martinez
Ffs Oviedo... Just bring Garbutt on instead
Stupid Mcgeady fucking hell, just Europa left for us now *attempted jinx*
Fucking hell
"John Stones is a football... Player" is another classic quote to add to the list for Michael Owen, useless.
Mcgeady is the worst tackler I think I've ever seen
Can't stand David James, clueless prick.
Samuel Eto'o.. He's had a few good games for us but mostly average... think it's just me who's not negative about a potential departure #EFC
Very happy with that team #EFC
Getting the same strange optimism as I had in the hours before the City game.. Buzzing for tonight
Sue: Alright

 
What a signing Carles Gil is for Villa
So Roy Hodgson voted for Mascherano as 2014 player of the year... How can an England manager, with such great experience, know so little?
So Alan Pardew's first signing as Palace manager is French.. New club, same Pardew.
@AllezAllezEFC fair enough, hope you're right, and that he's still with us then
@AllezAllezEFC yes,but Bony's record is still brilliant, and he's indispensable to Swansea.
@AllezAllezEFC if Lukaku was £28m then I think he's definitely worth more than £15m, more like £25m
@JoelParker_1878 each to their own I guess, don't recall a single take-on though
Looking forward to MOTD for the first time in weeks #efc
@JoelParker_1878 your point only highlights how poor he has been recently and his overall standard.
I thought, I'm having them, you can never have en…
@JoelParker_1878 you've got to be kidding...
Silva was different class today <OK HAND SIGN> Besic, Rom and Naisy stood out for us, we're on the up! #COYB #EFC
Could do with @Tim_Cahill today against Man City #COYB



HERE -&gt; 
Been to the dentist and had a haircut, home for 9.40am... New year new me.
Distin gives a way the corner, loses his man at the corner, 0-1. Worst defence in the league
Barry to get booked, Mirallas to be subbed at HT when we're losing and Coleman to dribble out of play with no one around him, odds please.
Van Gerwen was definitely pissed during that interview
Will the fucking coughing ever go away, called in sick. Don't enjoy doing it but couldn't be coughing on customers all day
Moyes' worst first 20 games is better than this seasons record..
Leicester, Burnley, QPR, Villa, Palace and West brom have all gained a point on us... 4 points from 18th, SHIT.
Happy new year my arse
Another shit performance and result
When was the last time there was a 0-0, 1-1, 2-2 and 3-3 on the same day in the PL? @OptaJoe
It just goes from bad to worse...
Cue a 'Well that escalated Quickly' about Man City - Sunderland
Lets do a Sunderland, or a Leicester, please Everton.

Seriously?
4 losses in a row, to Hull, Newcastle, Stoke and Southampton... Fucking shit. Get rid of Martinez, Kenwright.
Decent team that, glad to see jags, kone, Naismith and mirallas start but best of all distin on the bench
1 minute silence for Rio Ferdinand tonight, poor guy... #SpareAThoughtForRio 
Was about to apologise for my constant unhappy tweets about everton for those who don't care.. Lost a follower though haha
Bring back Moyes.
Take off etoo not kone fuck off Martinez.
No one can make a fucking tackle, Barry just let him go past, shocking performance this
No words..
All of our players are one-footed.. Makes us very predictable.
Et who'o? That was shite
Has Martinez just made a sub I agree with?! Surely not...

Aiden McGeady's ability: Also as of yet undisclosed.
"@Everton: Distin reacts well to deny Janmaat after the ball broke for the defender in the Blues' penalty area. 1-1." 
Koné's performance should get him another start, looks really sharp
Wtf is distin doing, fucking hate him
And he shouldn't be on the fucking pitch
Barry is fucking shit
Atrocious defending that
Our starting 11 is shite. No optimism whatsoever. 2-0 Newcastle. Ffs.
On another note, snow is shit.
Ffs what a time for the NCT website to be down, I need to be at work earlier than usual tomorrow. Going to the stop only way to check...
Downton was incredible <OK HAND SIGN>
Cannot wait for my Car to arrive
I'm dreading work between boxing day and new year more than I am excited for Christmas tbh
@amieelol stop tweeting and RTing my exact thoughts, its getting weird...
If the Clarke Carlisle Lorry incident was an attempt of suicide then thoughts should also go out to the Lorry Driver, as well as CC's family
Bed-ridden before 2 days of work, Christmas and then 2 more days of work.. #FML
10 points behind West Ham at Christmas...
Blisters have managed to bleed through multiple plasters, my sock and a heel pad on both feet... For foots sake
Been one of them days when everything seems to go wrong. A winning bet should put it right..
@EHarper95 that's the best bet you've ever put on.
Lamela looks like a lesbian
is the commentator deaf?
2 minutes from £1100 tonight and not far off another £2370.. Soooo frustrating
Sanjay is a twat #TheApprentice
Working during Late night shopping... 
You just know we're gonna draw the Shite in Europa League on Monday
Earliest I've woken up in a while and its my day off, ffs.
Cant wait to hand this in tomorrow, as smug as ever, yes Blyth!! 
Scenes at Victoria Park, what a goal, cmon Blyth!
Fancy Blyth Spartans to win tonight, Hartlepool are shit.. 0-1. #FACUP
@amieelol @MorganjMasters keep 'em coming
@amieelol @MorganjMasters that is brilliant, any other gems to unearth?
@amieelol @MorganjMasters what a twat, that calls for a screenshot of him... 
@amieelol fair enough, and living with @MorganjMasters I can completely understand your RT.
@amieelol your RT was merely a reminder and the frustration I had previously felt <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
People complaining about finishing college/uni close to Christmas.. You get at least 2 weeks off whilst most people are working so shat ap
@RoyalBlueEFC went to both as well as 0-0 vs West brom 2013/14...they're 3 of the last 8 or so I have been to #BadLuck
If you offered me 2-0 city I would snap your hand off, fear we're gonna be torn apart. #EFC
Lack of urgency was quite incredible at 1-1 Vs Hull who had just lost 4 in a row. RM needs to sort his tactics and substitutions out. #EFC
Buzzing for @Everton v Hull tonight, fancy these two to bag, 2-0 #COYB 


"Mourinho frustrated at lack of Atsu playing time and will threaten to recall him" ooooh, please do just that, José. #EFC
Fucking abysmal
Very confident of a win tomorrow but missing the first half due to work :( #EFC
Worried our unbeaten record in Europe against German opposition will be no longer after tonight's game. #EFC
@EvertonRecords not 2004?
@MorganjMasters didn't know it had an On switch 
If £65 is a big sum then I was right, cheers Messi.
Gonna win a big sum tonight, can feel it
If Bayern Munich win 2-0 then Porto were one goal away from winning me £1500..
"@TSBible: When Maicon scored this... 
Another £130, a very satisfying win.. What do you think @nicholson_sam ? 
Gutted to have missed the Everton game today but a good win, highlight being this... 
Gemma hasn't done her 'career' any favours... saying the words "I'm a celebrity get me out of here" makes her a liar too. Talentless Twat.
Another wasted day of doing nothing. Bored out my mind. Jealous of those at Uni, greatly.
@NWFAwards #GoalE
Christmas songs come on waaay tp early, and they're all shit.
Only just seen Roy Keane's comments about McCarthy and Coleman.. What a prick.
"@TheLadBible: Congratulations, it's a furby! 
Its just past 4am, I have to be up for work at 7.30 for 9-5.30.. Fuck.
"drama just follows me" - Yes Gemma, and food just lands in your mouth as well? Thick twat.
@MorganjMasters here he goes again @amieelol
@amieelol @MorganjMasters it's a new CHAPTER in his life..
@MorganjMasters @amieelol I wonder why...
That twat of an man doing the rounds on twitter isn't a representation of all Evertonians,  What difference does it make who he supports?
If there wasn't enough controversy about the Sunderland game today, how about where Larsson took the free kick from #Everton #EFC #SAFC
Ffs.. 
@amieelol gotta agree with you @MorganjMasters lad, bloody annoying things...
Yaya Toure just took out a little kid... 
Ooooh that hit a women right in the face, probably see it on twitter later #EagleEye
Yessssssssss
Fucking hell Austin, just score
Bloody Austin first goalscorer
Books must be one of the easiest things to wrap, but the task is too much for me.
Gogglebox is fucking shit... How is it so popular?!
9 of my last 11 tweeted photos are bet-related. #addiction
Yet another win.. 
Getting weird looks for wearing shorts.. Its bloody warm
Finally back in Nottingham after a frustrating afternoon and dull 0-0 #Everton
Relieved is not the word.
Impractical Jokers is class <OK HAND SIGN>
£200 for one night, hopefully more to come tomorrow <MONEY BAG>
Another win from Brazilian Serie B.. Easy. 
This betting lark is pretty easy to be fair.. 
this ref is terrible
3 day weekend is gonna be gooooood
Bradford fans retweeting and favouriting my tweet 'fuck off bradford' is weird, but even more strange is the fact that they're all white.
Total potential of £400+ ... Won nothing. Frustrated is not the word. 
Fuck off bradford
Two five folds currently need Watford &amp; Bristol City... Please..
Must be on course for some sort of Champions League goal record in one night... Shakhtar and Bayern have contributed to 10/21 goals so far.
What. A. Goal.
Fabiwanksi
Struggling against Austin Zamora  and Fer. Good luck with Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Bale hahahahaha
Two top class nights in a row #Reunited
@amieelol @MorganjMasters it was aimed at your stalker for his tweet...
@MorganjMasters @amieelol 
Get in. Another win, I've rediscovered my form. 
I should've put the bet on, fuck sake. 
@J_tizzle96 really well mate, opening a few shops over the next couple of weeks.
This game will finish 1-0 to England, I'm Tallinn you.
Quality couple of days in Sheffield. Back to business tomorrow.
En Route to Sheffield, hogging a table seat to myself, Exciteeeeeeed
Absolutely buzzing for Sheffield tomorrow
Gerard's goal in training wow<OK HAND SIGN> 
As for Howard, he can fuck off
Mirallas and Stones serious injuries 2 weeks in a row.. De gea outstanding saves. Poor until the last 5mins though. #efc
@MorganjMasters no matter what, you will always be the grumpy one.
When you realise Tony Hibbert will be up against Di Maria on Sunday... #Efc #Everton 
What a shit starting 11 again... Ffs #everton
@adampeberday I did but in accas :/
@adampeberday nothing but satisfaction that they've lost..
@adampeberday 3/3
The only bet I've won tonight... @nicholson_sam 
@adampeberday backed them to lose twice and that was West Ham and Villa this season, backed Basel for Weds...
@adampeberday correct. Never.
@adampeberday you probably back Derby too...
@adampeberday it means you might be happy if Forest lose. That's not right.
@adampeberday how can you back against your own team?! Forest will win 1-0
A day without a bet is a sad day. To live a life with that motto, is also sad.
Deadest day at work.
Downton Abbey is so underrated
You've got to start with the two derbies, Manchester teams favoured way too much. #MOTD
Calum Chambers, stop trying to do a Jagielka...
Kaboul has been outstanding, other than for the goal.
"@Everton: GOAL!!! WHAT A HIT. PHIL JAGIELKA!!! #LFCvEFC" @nicholson_sam
Might get a Jagielka tattoo like
Martinez... Decision making has been awful all season.
Eto'o on for Barry, he needs to go off at HT, although Martinez will keep him on no doubt
We could play all day and not score, matter of time for them, though. Lallana only player.on the pitch playing well

Need you here mate
Barry red card is imminent
Thanks atkinson
How can a manger think differently to 99% of fans?! Mirallas won't do enough defensively, lallana and Moreno will run rings around hibbert
666 days since Hibbo started a PL game for us.. Says it all.. Martinez, what are you thinking?!
@adampeberday yeah I literally replied then scrolled down to see it aha nightmare! 2-0 spurs for me..
@adampeberday no chance, they'll win AET
Decent bet tonight, that's how you do it @J_tizzle96 
Well that question went down a treat @Everton ... 
Leicester 1-2 Man UtdSpurs 2-0 West BromEverton 2-1 Palace Man City 2-3 Chelsea @J_tizzle96

@J_tizzle96 Leave it out mate, this was meant to be a happy day.
Leaving work tomorrow after my last day on £2.68 an hour... 
Already looks like a good signing does Abel Hernandez.
Just realised I'm going out this Thursday, but Everton are playing.. Fuck sake.
@OliviaaChilds Merseypride.
I don't watch much boxing but I've just seen a match that lasted 42 seconds before the ref stepped in. Incredible. #FightNight
Martinez Out.Lambert in. #Efc
Why can't anybody spell CLEVERLEY?
Without Sturridge and sterling starting I can see Weimann 0-1, might have a bang on that as Ray'd say
@nicholson_sam @kierrn1 @MorganjMasters 
Liverpool 0-1 Aston Villa, Cleverley with a 30 yard screamer, I'd take that.
Fraser Foster, John Stone, Jack Wiltshire, Eric Dyer, Bafetimbi Gomez.. Why can't pundits and experts pronounce names properly..
Bye bye Felix Magath

@LadbrokesPromos I'm not angry, just disappointed, Mindy.
@LadbrokesPromos Do I get a free bet for #MyAcca
If my acca wins tonight but because the slip I ripped they don't pay out, I'll be fuming
@ladbrokespromos does it matter that my betting slip is ripped? 
I see betting as a solution for a lack of money, this isn't good.
Have barely a penny to my name, partly due to a worrying gambling addiction. But I'll be ok if this beauty comes off. 
@scarr15 some twat on Sky interrupted a sports reporter by shouting it for all to hear

Got a sneaky feeling about one of my bets today.. #NeedTheMoney
@J_tizzle96 Swansea 2-0 West Brom QPR 0-1 Sunderland Everton 1-1 Chelsea
Always wonder where my money went after a night out.. £1.50 to my fucking name...
instead of sideburns I have sick burns.
Head is spinning. Missed the toilet a lot with my sick.. Woke up with a lot of sick on me. Last night was sick.
MK Dons 4-0 Man United. MK Dons corners - 0Man United corners - 10.
Don't worry Man United fans, you'll still be 5 star on fifa...
Number 5 for eto'o? Interesting choice.
Decent signing is Eto'o, with his reputation it's amazing to have won the race to sign him. However I don't think we should expect too much.
@J_tizzle96 watch and learn, Junior.
Wasn't that an own goal?
Who's that for City? Martin Demessichelis?!
@J_tizzle96 you were never the master... 3-1 City for me
Quite confident of a City Win for once, Allen and Henderson will be powerless to stop Silva, Nasri and Touré. #MNF #MCFC
Eto'o... If we sign him he better not start ahead of Naismith..
@SkySportsMNF anyone would think Liverpool were at home looking at this...

@J_tizzle96 alright then, just picked the ones on TV, but I agree on EFC-lcfc so I'll say Stoke 2-0 villa  and QPR 1-2 Hull
Man Utd - Swansea 3-1
Liverpool - Southampton 3-0

For about 6-7 weeks I've been waiting to go to Leicester away, as soon as the tickets come on general sale I find myself asking for spares..
2 tickets wanted for Leicester away, any spares @EvertonArentWe @FourthOfficial_ @Everton
132 hours until we play Leicester, to say I can't stop thinking about it is an understatement. It's been too long, despite the World Cup...

@scarr15 oh yessss , brilliant
How have Fulham done it?! I don't know but West Brom, Swansea, Everton, Newcastle, Spurs all won there. #Expected #Fortress
Hahahaha
Got 3-1 on @talkSPORT predictor as my banker so may as well get a 3rd Utd. Fulham won't score...
Yep
Ffs.. Floodgates?
@FourthOfficial_ bait for Utd fans, you'll make them cross
@alexcthfc yes, hence my original tweet..
@FourthOfficial_ they'll get a penalty sooner rather than later
Carrick and Fletcher in CM when Mata is out wide? Cluekess Moyes when Januzaj is on the bench.
@TomTHFC_ yeah and you spent more before, still have money to spend. You'll finish 6th.
Gutted that I'm working on Friday, had to cancel my busy schedule...
@alexcthfc takes one to know one.
@TomTHFC_ @Chiriches_ because we don't have hundreds of millions like Spurs do, and guess what? You still can't get Champs League...
Thank you Moyes

@nicholson_sam hmm ok then, I misspelt Sidwell... That's all.

@Gary_khan @EvertonArentWe he 's returning from an injury Gary.. And Berbatov had gone to Monaco, you're clueless...
@J_tizzle96 yeah, had a bad season Then played a couple of games this season, scored a couple of goals, looked sharp. Doing well for Hull...
@nicholson_sam @EFCFanBlog embarassing...
@J_tizzle96 why? So I could give you some insight as you're lacking any football knowledge...
@J_tizzle96 do you know anything about football?
@itsabeckything always needed to win on Wednesday...
Everyone saying we need a striker, yeah, we fucking sold him to Hull... Why did we sell Jelavic? #EFC
Come on Heitinga lad do us a favour..
@Georgeblott if we'd have shown urgency after going 1 down it wouldn't be as frustrating. We should have had a peno too. Fuckin Twattenburg.
We'll still finish above them though, Spurs are an average side.. Very very lucky today
@KellyJoyceB @Georgeblott justified screaming
Terrible last half an hour from Everton, as soon as pienaar went off
Fuck off McGeady pile of wank
“@PierceBramley: Osman has been awful” @J_tizzle96
Always offside mirallas, jeeeez.
Naismith and Osman off deulofeu and traore on. Leave McGeady on the bench.... Please.
@J_tizzle96 serious. He should've scored a couple at least and loses the ball all the time. Slow weak and shit.
To say we are fucking unlucky is an understatement
Barkley or Deulofeu on for Osman needs to hurry up and happen
McCarthy brilliant so far. Winning every 50/50
Distin is 36 yet walks faster than Osman runs
Get Osman off
@adampeberday I went a bit scouser whilst trying to type can't haha
Cat afford to get another Injury today and need to avoid losing. Massive game #EFC #Top4
How come Sturridge is coming back on?
Finally an over-performing arsenal side have been undone. Just a shame it was Liverpool to do it...
Favourite from Tim Cahill #jolly
@Tim_Cahill Bet you weren't thinking that when you brushed passed him at Wembley and he somehow won a free-kick
@nicholson_sam that's Ghana cause some controversy
@nicholson_sam I'm hoping we'll get them away in quarters, simple.
If we beat Swansea then we could get, Sheffield weds or forest/Sheffield Utd away.. Please please please.
The home team Preston pressed and were unlucky. #NFFC #pnefc

Had such a good day today, first i passed my driving test, then i won £60 on an acca and now all i need is Villa to win!
“@OptaJoe: 8 - Arsenal have kept eight clean sheets in their last nine games in all competitions at the Emirates Stadium.” @gerardeulofeu

West ham concede 5 at forest and Allardyce thinks *shit, need a solid defender in* so he signs Roger J, who's been relegated last 3 seasons.
I don't see West ham turning this around in the second leg... Without an away goal it's never easy..
West ham fans singing "Fuck off Sam Allardyce" and "Paulo di canio"...
That Marcos Lopes won't score but he'll come close #prediction
How can people think Arsenal or Chelsea can win the league when City are scoring for fun... Can't see West Ham surviving mind you...

@cope_beth "used to be" proves my point.. They shouldn't be expecting a win..
@cope_beth why though? They're both shit sides.
Carrick, cleverley and Welbeck have been their usual average. How they get into the England side I'll never know..

“Martin Atkinson has been appointed referee for Manchester Utd v Everton on Wednesday 4 December" @nicholson_sam - which team will he choose
Said it all season, spurs are poor, no end product and with Dawson at the back they can only dream of top 4 #Spurs
Sandro in pre match interview "We (spurs) need to win if we're going to challenge for the PL title" how's that looking @sandroraniere ?
“@JakeFish96: @nicholson_sam many a derby is just as good if not better, what makes liverpool everton any better?” Shit game yesterday tbf
