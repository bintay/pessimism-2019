@Mollybecoolin he been said it  
WTF!!!!....
Your thoughts gets the best of you at this time... <UNAMUSED FACE>
Gotta get back on my feet.... I gotta figure it out
I need madden #help
Man! Anything more than 6 im happy... Even tho I'm always optimistic for the the playoffs lol 
@FindingIsaiah_ same here I didn't feel DHB'd after this draft so I'm cool wit the potential..
OAKLAND RAIDERS DRAFT CLASS 2015 - HYPE VIDEO (HD) @FindingIsaiah_ what you thinking bout the draft bro? 
I gotta get some food I'm really bout to die
Good morning.
I look at everything different
Good morning, I'm up so I'm blessed
Amari Cooper.
And THIS big pass-catching tight end?

Don't sleep on the @RAIDERS: 
I wish I coulda grabbed them 4s
Every problem or mistake I've made, I then make it a rule for it but to happen again... You have to care about fixing it before it gets fix
I try to be proactive when fixing problems, I don't correcting them when they happen. It shows you don't care until it's a problem
Woke up hungry, and somthing on my mind.... Can you guess what?
I just be thinking
Coop it is..
Big Catt or nah?!?!?
You never know
@FindingIsaiah_  Man bra, I hope they go Cooper, L. Williams or trade down... What you thinking? I don't want another DHB type of pick
Your free to do so 
Therefore being weak now is only a realization that I gotta get back on it..... I'm straight I got this!!!
And because I've been betrayed by the ones that are supposed to love me, I have spent a large portion of my adulthood displaying strength..
I view weakness as a window of opportunity for you to be taken advantage of..
I'm not a fan of showing weakness, and I've just realized lately that's all I've been exhibiting....
I'm really sitting here reading thru tweets and I'm like wow... I really need to get off here cause this is what I don't need....
Now I'm on everything....
You never know what's going on, you just hope for the best...
Smh
You gotta separate yourself
Being in a tent for the weekend will do some strange things to your brain  bro lol 
Fuck
I'm fucked up
I can't help going with how I feel... I keep mouth closed and eyes wide open

But he almost had me fucked up tho, but in better than that...
But hey he was an over 65 year old white man, so it's not his fault he was raised in a different time period wit black and whites
Dude was ignorant as fuck to say something with out knowing, but by assuming that me a young black guy couldn't own a nice car outright..
When in reality I'm fucked up that he would assume I don't have the pinkslip to mines... His backhand compliment wasn't worth one in return
He follows up with a "yeah your right, but I'll stick with my Ford, I have the pinkslip" a laughed him off and sent him on his way...
So I'm thanking the guy, and he says "it's kinda expensive don't ya think" I'm like "not really if you take care of it"
I went to grab something out of the car, and A guy says "I love your car, it's so nice". I'm really appreciative of anybody being nice!
People be killing me, some people just don't know how to just  genuinely give a compliment..

@TeamJDOWL it's on you fam!
@RellzRantz that's what I'm saying!!
@ROTudda plus if we land Suh, our Dline will much improved which means less time for QB to have ball = less pressure on DBs
@ROTudda I'm pretty confident in dude, Ross must've earned that spot plus we don't have I pay him as much
@ROTudda Bruh Suh?!? Suh would mean a lot to our Defense, I hope we hit on this draft
@ROTudda yeah cause we naked back there when it comes to talent. We drafted a safety last year 6rd J.Dowling I'm anxious to see what he got

Being broke is a mind state, which means you got the same 24 hours in a day and you choose to be lazy. You choose to be BROKE

I bet if we signed Rex , we can lure Suh and get our defense right
I personally would like Rex, and a HC caliber OC and we'll be good.
It seems like nobody want the @RAIDERS job, Gruden chose TV (twice), Harbaugh chose college.
We basically gotta play a perfect game. #smh
