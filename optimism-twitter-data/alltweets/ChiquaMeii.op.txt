@PurestInNoSense I've been retweeting thinking that's how I reply at first. But then I never saw my comment under the pps original comment.
@PurestInNoSense I'm using the tweeter app for smart phones I guess. I have a lot of symbols. But I'll play around with it. What's a retweet
@PurestInNoSense Where is that and what symbol is that? Sorry for all the ?'s you started something now...lol.
@PurestInNoSense I see and without you even knowing. You have taught me something. Now where do you look to see who is talking to you?
