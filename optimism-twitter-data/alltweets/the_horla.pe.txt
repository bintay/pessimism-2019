@merggies 3: idk how to use denti-cal, honestly. Like, is there a separate card? What do
It's weird that I'll start shit if the customer in front of me is a dick to the cashier but I'm afraid to make a dentist appt via phone call
@captainboo They make attachments for that
@merggies been there tbh, good luck &amp; godspeed
@merggies no Diet Coke and no comics make Merg something something 
@ginalikesthis forever the Twitter quick tab preview for Chrome on my phone btw, it's never changed from this 
@ginalikesthis so lucky I have you to look out for me and also dope me for massages
@ginalikesthis what about xanies AND a mixed drink
@ginalikesthis I will do anything for Xanax
@ginalikesthis well you can, idk, reiki me or something, how's that
Also it's too bad I'm terrified of being touched because I bet a back rub would be effing incredible about now holy crud
This just in I am strong and manly as fuq I don't care what my three foot tall teddy bear led you to believe I am all that is (sweaty) man
Does anyone know how much to tip movers and also whether it's weird to offer to get them food
@horsetornadoes I seriously just want to die in this next place I'm living rather than ever have to move again
MOVING WHY
I'm doing that thing where I'm awake again...
we could probably use some more songs about heroin
@merggies I don't mind unpacking really tbh because I love organizing but I HATE packing and I've done it like 25 times in my life and ughhh
yay moving so much fun weee <PILL><PISTOL><SYRINGE><SKULL>
Damn why is Ikea crawling with so many hot dirtbags today
@horsetornadoes @merggies RAD
@curtiseveretts <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Scouring Craigslist for furniture and basically after this weekend I never want to hear or read the word Ektorp again.
This dude has such a sexy beard. Do you think it's rude to flirt with her in front of him?
@curtiseveretts Glad you're doing okay! My mom just had hers out too, but she didn't get an awesome picture
@merggies In the world of desperation, I guess
@merggies lol body wraps are one of the hottest scams right now
@captainboo @axania Lol poor Quinn, make sure to let him know we appreciate the sacrifice he made by being outdoors <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@axania Do you mind if I post to my Instagram as well??
@axania I can't even, what an amazing photo!! So awesome!
@fixedfocused worse, it's like the SodaStream
Knitting and crochet are the respective Coke and Pepsi of yarn crafts. Weaving is like RC I guess
"You'd be a great police psychologist slash suicide ledge negotiator who secretly is very fucked up." Guys I think I've found my typecast
@wtvoc Damn it I knew they would be, I gotta get on that shit. Also: You're welcome! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@fixedfocused :3 :3 :3
WHO JUST MADE TWO PHONE CALLS BY HIMSELF THAT'S RIGHT ME man I am killing it today
Well I for one find it super convenient to be able to decide the baby's personality early and get that out of the way 
@fixedfocused @tuckermonteith That's probably like every single straight male actor over 25 though right?
@tuckermonteith That and "What the hell do I know that actor from?" are the only reasons I use it.
I've never played Russian roulette but I Have looked up really hot actors to see if they're older or younger than me so I get the gist of it
@captainboo Really? Why? I know so little about him but I want to hate someone too!
@wtvoc There are worse ways
@wtvoc 3d or flat? I have some heart glitter tape and a variety of metallic, glittery, iridescent etc heart stickers, and some plastic gems
@wtvoc ikr ughhhh
"I REGRET NOTHING"
Okay we found it, I'm being completely totally serious when I say DJ knocked it behind the bed when he was sensually cuddling his new vacuum
@merggies it's in a factory sealed bag though so will it even stink? We might not find it until we move D:
In other news, idek how but DJ lost a bag of still-frozen spinach somewhere in this room, I mean like we cannot find it ANYWHERE
I'm so happy and lucky with my friend circle these days, definitely including all of you guys. Feeling so rad about that, always, at least.
Thank you SO MUCH everyone, your encouragement seriously helped an eff ton and it all worked out!! Thank you!!
Dressed like a church group leader about to con my way into a lease so I'll continue having a home, please wish me luck if you have a moment
@merggies Smart Merggles, and also tactful Merggles for ignoring that I spelled college "collage"!
@merggies before it was FDA approved here because it's So Great apparently, like nothing else compares, even Sensodyne (2/2)
@merggies Did you buy the Colgate brand?? I legit know a dental collage headmaster who used to smuggle that stuff in bulk from Canada (1/2)
That's for sure not more important than me still having a place to live 2 weeks from now, that would just be silly ha hahaha ha ha ha...
Definitely not sitting here stressing over why "malodorous" means stinky but "bonodorous" isn't a word, with no perfect synonym for stinky
@xmyrin omg YES, anyway you're eating for 2 now, by which I mean you and also me bc I don't have fried chicken but wish to heavens I did tbh
@merggies Use this interval to reflect and be relieved. Then tp your doc's car on the way out.

@merggies You did it, it's done, and now you don't need think about it for a good while without feeling guilt about not thinking about it.
@merggies it was useful because you went, and actually physically going the first time is so so key and now you've done that. That is useful
@givemoneynow Wait do you even have Jergens in the U.K.? 
@givemoneynow Now I'm just imagining horrible lit theory insults. "You're so stupid you rubbed Jürgen Habermas on your skin to moisturize"
@givemoneynow I made it up just now and felt like a huge jackass immediately after hitting "post" :x
Like, whatever, bro's so ugly, when he gazes into the abyss I bet the abyss chooses not to gaze back
This asshole looking at me like I'm a freak at the drug store rn (muscle spraining eyeroll)
@horsetornadoes 
@merggies @katielikesthis so fuckin proud of you right now Merg, too proud even to come up with a stupid smartass quip
@merggies @katielikesthis guuuuuurl
HA HAHAHAHA HA HA HA HAHAHA HA RT@AlanWattsDaily A less brainy culture would learn to synchronize its body rhythms rather than its clocks.
@merggies @katielikesthis you're a great candidate for the vaccine if you haven't had it already, you know.
@fixedfocused @Fayehsdiary This tweet brought me much joy, false or not
@merggies No it's based on the test or lab work category in question not specific results
This person's review of the nearest public library is just a very earnest "good selection of books! :)"
Today seems like a good day to feel bad about being me and also eat some tacos maybe
As opposed to before, when... ? RT @TheAVClub With Wilder Mind, Mumford &amp;Sons have morphed into a band that’s hard to care much about at all
@merggies @ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey fuck yes this is exactly why gas stoves &gt;&gt;&gt; electric ones, tortillas 100%
@fixedfocused shhhh
Maybe I should look into becoming a narc because there is definitely something about me that makes people want to give/sell me illegal drugs
@sharivari80 I just started watching but already I'm getting sucked in and also pretty sure I'm some kind of sociopath surrounded by liars.
Does anyone here watch Lie to Me jw
Feel like the dudes should be trying way harder
Why do they even invite dudes to the Met Ball
@RainbowAshlyn negl I'm just waiting for someone to come barreling out their door one day thinking I'm a teenage dick doing something stupid
@afamilyoftrees MGMTyourlifeisalie.mp3, an ode to dragonfruit
@afamilyoftrees Of all fruits and possibly all produce, dragonfruit has the highest discrepancy between coolness of name and enjoyability
@givemoneynow I mean it HAS to
Do you think famous Twitters get an add-on to know which @ replies are from people they should bother responding to (other celebrities)?
Sometimes when I'm up all night and I'm walking around early Tuesday morning I pull everyone's empty trash bin back up their drive for them?
@captainboo I like how she just sort of randomly threw in the word hypocritical because "your faces" by itself didn't sound mean enough.
@fixedfocused @tuckermonteith fuck what kind of chonies he rocks; is he a giver or a taker, end of
@merggies @ginalikesthis @katielikesthis I'm already stocking up on Bob's Burgers gifs now js js
@merggies @ginalikesthis @katielikesthis as soon as you're finished we'll have a little Twitter party to celebrate I PROMISE IT'LL BE GRAND
@merggies @ginalikesthis @katielikesthis and when I say personal experience I mean Extensive so trust me and also
@merggies @ginalikesthis @katielikesthis speaking from experience, you will be glad you went far more than you'd be relieved by canceling
@fixedfocused I like this tweet because you can put the words in any order
@ginalikesthis I am like the opposite of that lol
@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis I got the braces, I did that shit for like 6 years
@xmyrin We have the same kitchen trash can and it is not at all weird that I immediately noticed this
@katielikesthis @goddamnitkelsey @ginalikesthis @merggies No wait I saw an episode of House where a copper IUD made a nun hallucinate Jesus
Geico: The car insurance for people who have just committed a felony and need to get the fuck out of town ASAP
For me the most important factor in choosing car insurance is Definitely how long it takes me to acquire it. 20 MINUTES? FUCK THAT.
@merggies Ah yes, the [perfect size] 4th level of hell.
@wtvoc Dude fuck DJ, twice as much for me! I made my own meatballs from scratch and they're so good I'm having a cigarette afterward tbh
@wtvoc in my head I'm pretending you're still live tweeting the MayPac fight instead of the Met Ball and it's delightful
Never mind I found it
Shit hey you guys did anyone see where I left my soda
Getting "low impulse control" tattooed on my forehead so people will know I'm definitely not fucking around with that one
Age of Ultron felt more like an Eon of Ultron really (tired jackoff motion)
I need to suck it up and accept that ain't no one gonna hire a disabled trans guy with a 25 hour day, at least no one soliciting applicants.
If you want me to still have a place to live in two weeks please cross your fingers, thank you everyone!
@goddamnitkelsey honestly, I would rather they have a longer lifespan than most people I know :x
@goddamnitkelsey We thought he was just tired because he's getting older, but it's been a big improvement for his activity level tbh
@goddamnitkelsey Have you talked to a vet re: something for arthritis/soreness/stiffness? Dennis takes baby aspirin now and it really helps!
@goddamnitkelsey He seemed cool with it, is the upshot, and I bet Bailey still had a really good time on the walk too! ♡
@goddamnitkelsey The story has a happy ending at least, they fed him pancakes and let him chill until my mom could leave work &amp; come get him
@goddamnitkelsey ♡♡♡
@goddamnitkelsey One time our dog "ran away" and the people 2 doors down called like "Your dog is lying down in our garage and won't get up"
Credit scores/reports: just in case you started to feel like your existence had any value outside the economy for a second there
@goddamnitkelsey honestly either tactic has its benefits
@goddamnitkelsey I cut in early and set precedent by bringing home a "nice girl!" they loved and then being like "SURPRISE I MET HER ONLINE"
@emavalexis well for starters, the dress is blue
@MJMcKean do I win?? 
MayPac was good. Twitter all cares intensely about a sport they never even think about otherwise, but it's much briefer than the World Cup.
"But Floyd is out of there like an otter slithering out of a pot of Nutella." - whoever is writing the live update feed for The Telegraph
@wtvoc he plans to hit up the coinstar later, got all his loose change with him
@Fayehsdiary However this ends I'm just so happy knowing he's going to punch the shit out of Mayweather. I hope he gets some good face shots

@katielikesthis what kind of donut and what kind of pie
@ginalikesthis o m G
So pumped to see @failure at my favorite venue in my hometown tomorrow like I cannot believe. Ten kinds of nostalgia there waiting for me.
@afamilyoftrees the most recent two, I assume
@merggies I was actually also thinking this
@ginalikesthis @merggies <RAISED HAND>
Man, remember laser tag? REMEMBER LASER TAG?
and whatever happens in between.
Ya yep RT @fuckeveryword: fuck cisgender
@xmyrin @merggies The memory of him making it sing Christmas carols like a puppet is forever etched in my mind
@xmyrin @merggies In hs my best friend, whose sister was a nurse, painted/decorated a speculum to look like a reindeer for me for Christmas.
@merggies Yeah I feel that, I hope you get a crash day really soon! <SPARKLING HEART>
@merggies I literally went to bed yesterday afternoon and didn't wake up until this morning, and it was all you could wish for it to be.
@merggies I have been so fucking anxious and stressed lately, now that I'm back in San Diego I just want to chilllll and sleeeeep
@merggies an admirable goal
@wtvoc @merggies And me, I don't even need to wonder, motherfucker
@RainbowAshlyn it's a m a z i n g tbh 
@RainbowAshlyn I've also just received a hank of yarn from Mothyandthesquid, was that also you? I couldn't tell from the packing info! :x
@RainbowAshlyn So soft and squishy and gorgeous!! 
So all I need to know right now is, what's the best way for me to ride this cresting mega-wave of high self esteem all the way to shore
Just told, by someone I used to sleep with and genuinely adore, that I was more interesting and had a better body when I was still homeless.
@breesrants @merggies @goddamnitkelsey It's depressing how to most people she's not a separate person, with her own band and everything, tho
@breesrants @merggies @goddamnitkelsey I dislike Courtney but it's internalized bad parenting issues tbh nothing to do with Kurt at all :x
@goddamnitkelsey @ginalikesthis omg amazing! What product was this again?? Are you shedding your old skin like a beautiful snake?
YOU GUYS @RainbowAshlyn sent me SO MUCH SOCK YARN so I guess what I'm saying is she's my favorite now, sorry #yarn #alltheyarn #socks4ever

@fixedfocused Oh I didn't think about the roots thing! Can you use dry shampoo sometimes instead of washing or does that fade the color too?
"Well I guess these dishes aren't going to wash themselves..." - me, trying reverse psychology on my dishes
@dickpaws mace.
@ginalikesthis weren't those mutton chops and barbed wire tattoos SO convincing?!?
@ginalikesthis mine was as a gas station store clerk!
Flying back to San Diego today
@merggies @ginalikesthis @mialopolis the spikes to prevent grinding and dry humping are a nice touch
@merggies (reply with link to Google image results for "rubens painting") yeah but- (endless spam baroque paintings of fuller figured women)
@merggies Sounds like it just got stuck in a memory loop. If the mouse is being unresponsive &amp; there was a lot of lag, rebooting should fix
Apparently the fastest easiest way to get your Twitter validated is to write some shit for Buzzfeed, like damn, whose d did everyone there s
@sharivari80 I was also very satisfied and thrilled by that one
Man, if there's one thing I really love about being me I don't know what that one thing is
@merggies just be glad you don't have dogs tbh at this point if I drop something and there's no dog around I'm just like "meh it'll turn up"
@katielikesthis quick: dragons!
Okay that was a no on the shaved head; ty everyone who participated, and who continues to warmly embrace my very low impulse control!
I fucked up at least fifteen rows back. Do I unravel back to it or fudge a compensation to rebalance?
It is actually so damn hard not letting a circadian rhythm disorder control or ruin your life.
@merggies To match the inseam I mean. Does that help at all? Actually you've reminded me I've got to do all his pajamas before I leave Omaha
@merggies When I do Carl's I just lay them out with a pair I already know are the right length, lining up crotches instead of waistbands?
Do you think dogs can tell the difference between "real" petting and when you sort of idly rub them with your foot while you do other stuff?
@afamilyoftrees seriously, it scared the piss out of DJ and me both
@afamilyoftrees it was going to be so fucking boss, that teaser game was incredible
Fyi @afamilyoftrees that Silent Hills game was gonna star Norman Reedus as both voice and cgi model, so pour one out
Man this is just super not Kojima's year, is it
@breesrants Do you find that works if you're not tired but need to sleep, or more for when you ARE tired but can't fall asleep?
@breesrants @ginalikesthis @jessicabear @xmyrin mine will be Echo Danger (gender neutral) &amp; Poker Legend Doyle Brunson (also gender neutral)
Twitter what are your most successful ways to make yourself sleep
Apples in Stereo in this Quaker Oats commercial? Wild
@captainboo @axania alternately, petting or feeding Blousey at the right angle might provide relief to your back muscles. Worth a try eh? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@xmyrin @goddamnitkelsey they are terrifying. It's weird how being a Californian can make you feel some kind of attached to ones you were in
@xmyrin @goddamnitkelsey my brother totally slept through Northridge and that shit was taking down power lines in our area
@jessicabear @merggies RIGHT THEY ARE LIKE TWINS
@merggies @ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey I'd be offended except I was basically born in my mid late sixties
@ginalikesthis @merggies You are both still wee babies, especially you Merg, and tbh Gina you should get a donut to celebrate that fact <DOUGHNUT>
@merggies So what's the problem? That picture is adorable tbh?
My mommy. 
I wonder whether even @TheAVClub itself remembers anymore what kind of site it originally intended to be
@fixedfocused How often do you have to get it redone jw? Do you have to get your roots lightened? Manic Panic faded so fast, back in the day
@afamilyoftrees succinct RT @rolldiggity: Jared Leto's Joker looks like a Halloween store's version of Jared Leto's Joker.
@xmyrin @msdictator awesome, thanks for the info, and I saw your UNICEF retweet, thank you!
@msdictator What is the best aid organization for my parents to donate to in order to help with this, do you know? I can't find anything.
Now have greater peace of mind; tonight is winding down well! I probably deserve chips and soda.
@captainboo better shot of them :3 
@captainboo They are gorgeous, pictures don't do them justice!
@captainboo I just checked; they're 50% Cotton, 17% Wool, 17% Nylon, 16% Silk so you'll have to wash them with your delicates. Yay so happy!
@captainboo Okay great! I'll wash and reblock them and send them along with some MilkyWay Midnights! I believe I have your address. :) :)
@captainboo it's super nice yarn and I'm worried that trying to unravel them now might ruin the yarn and that would be a big waste tbh so
@captainboo they're a cotton/silk/wool blend and do you think you might want them, basically!
@captainboo okay I don't know how Twitter just straight up skipped the middle two tweets of that tweet chain
@captainboo love them and get some use out of them, I think, than have them just sit in my sock drawer. (4/4) 
@captainboo right so I made these socks for myself and honestly they just are too small and have little stretch, but they are so (1/4)
@ginalikesthis omg I think @DavidBHayter  has a dog named Zephyr too :'3
@tuckermonteith man been there tbh

@afamilyoftrees (bravely raises his hand)
@ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey @katielikesthis (Gina drops mic and walks offstage)
@goddamnitkelsey Sounds like a dude. A dude who had a spare sheet and tacks on hand, and is lazy and has no style.
@goddamnitkelsey they ain't free tho
Have you ever just suddenly remembered all the Glaring Flaws of someone you'd recently renewed an infatuation with, celebrity or otherwise?
@TheAVClub might not have been super duper appropriate to lead that article with that pic
Hey does anyone here have about women's US size 6.5 or slightly smaller feet, or have a kid who wears roughly that size? Please let me know!

Man Jeremy Renner could take some advice from Chris Evans on how to word an apology though at the very least.
Charming. RT@HuffingtonPost Chris Evans &amp; Jeremy Renner face backlash after calling Black Widow a "slut" in interview 
Someone felt this was a Totally Fine DVD title screen but our society's got no problem in the way we view/treat women 
@katielikesthis if they can do cronuts &amp; duffins &amp; all manner of hybrid desserts, there has to be a pie donut (pienut?) out there waiting
@merggies get two they are social animals and also the cutest most perfect lil dumplings :3 :3 :3
Dogs: The pets that give you more love than you deserve!
@horsetornadoes I assume the cronut tweet is related to the dudes punching each other in a gym tweet
@afamilyoftrees clearly.
@givemoneynow lol eww, Keith Gessen. I knew I'd dislike him the day I read Jonathan Franzen calling his writing "delicious".
@afamilyoftrees @NASA lolllll

@tuckermonteith @RainbowAshlyn LOUD MOUTH BREATHERS. Mouth breathers eating are especially bad bc they have to pause their chewing and UGH
@RainbowAshlyn And only really specific noises! For me it's definitely the dreaded Food Sounds like I will eat meals alone in my room lol D:
@RainbowAshlyn ME TOO. I'm 100% sure it's linked to my severe tinnitus, I've had white noise going almost 24/7 in my room for 4 years now
@merggies @ginalikesthis ty, I had a tough night/morning &amp; had to cancel an appt but feel much better now mental health &amp; heartburn wise lol
@goddamnitkelsey DAMN!
@goddamnitkelsey I bet you could totally convince them
@RainbowAshlyn omg :D

@captainboo ISN'T IT A SIGHT TO BEHOLD
@torsstupidmouth @oldpicsarchive just looking at that photo is making me feel panicked and nauseated tbh
Damn it
Is anyone awake and perhaps willing to make a brief u.s. phone call for me? 3:
@ginalikesthis ugh I should shut up tbh
@ginalikesthis My disrespect. For his trite little homage when he still affectionately calls me "little girl" instead of "son". Thanks dude.
Carl earnestly informed me his computer password is Turing and when I laughed at that he honest to shit became indignant about my disrespect
@merggies @ginalikesthis Nearing the end of the film now, quite seriously holding in my tears and vomit until the credits, shaking from it
@ginalikesthis @merggies It's fucking stupid b/c I promise I have plenty experience with all of this unlike Carl, but it's always about him?
Know how in Inglorious Basterds they just changed it all, killing Hitler etc, &amp; it was satisfying? Why can't they do that with Alan Turing?!
@ginalikesthis @merggies Do you know, that would have a much better chance of working if only I'd thought of it three days ago
@merggies Christ I wish. That's really super not how it works with my dad.
@merggies I've got to be honest, I really really REALLY don't want to watch this fucking movie (we (cont) 
@merggies I realize this is a tough question, but in your opinion what is the scene where, when I get to it, I should say "k done" and stop?
@merggies (about his later treatment, derision, loneliness and subsequent suicide, to clarify)
@merggies be explicitly awful because I'm pretty sensitive and prone to upset but my dad is SO into watching this with me (2/2)
@merggies Well I haven't seen it but I know quite a lot about Alan Turing and I know where that one goes and I just don't want it to (1/2)
@captainboo @thedogist omg Chorizo is such a good name for a dog tho
My dad wants me to watch The Imitation Game with him; is this going to just turn into me angry and crying within the hour? Serious question.

@merggies clearly you have a lot of feelings about this Jon dude
@merggies I googled all of this and still don't understand what George knew before Jon. I'LL NEVER READ THESE BOOKS BUT NOW I HAVE TO KNOW
No one is more stubbornly naïve than guys thinking they're brilliant listing "free dirt" on Craigslist instead of paying to have it hauled.
@captainboo Ikr?! There was one ball of machine washable cashmere blend on clearance and I was like "this is so soft, has to be babby socks"
Making cute as fuq babby socks, no idea what age babby they would even fit or what I'm going to do with them?? 
Prob zero point in clarifying what each app update is for if you're always just going to put "optimization and bug fixes" #lookingatyouzynga
@katielikesthis girl dang!
@merggies honestly my only skill with any real world application is creative problem solving
@merggies turn them inside out, squiggle on some puffy paint, let it dry overnight. They stay in your hair way better, I do this w/ my mom's
@merggies Honest to shit. What, like she doesn't have snacks in her house at all? They gotta come from somewhere.
@merggies I did that too, so I wouldn't have to go out again later, and so I could eat it slowly throughout the day like a grazing deer
@ginalikesthis @merggies @katielikesthis ...pation

@axania yup!
@axania Heehee! I'm sure it doesn't nearly compare to greedily stealing his mommy's body heat though
@tuckermonteith Oh wow, yeah that was a perfect pick tbh
@tuckermonteith J Law is a good guess but I sort if hope they pick someone more atypical. Who was it last year?
@merggies My mom goes through Pepcid Compete like candy
@merggies getting/taking HRT and I never want to admit that to doctors :x (3/3)
@merggies problems because I worry it might have to do with how shitty I treated my body while homeless or might interfere with (2/3)
@merggies Apparently my mom, aunt, uncle and grandma all have GERD too. Tbh sometimes I'm afraid to report this kind of health (1/3)
@merggies Damn, your doctor knows priorities haha
@merggies I thought I was just mega stressed with too many meds at first? It just started one day several months ago and has never stopped.
@merggies I have Prilosec otc but the doctor said to get a prescription as soon as I'm back in CA so it will be free lol
@axania Hooray! Meant to tell you, blanket is also dryer safe, won't shrink b/c the acrylic and will get softer with each run b/c the cotton
@msdictator @VictoriasSecret they really looked nice &amp; high quality! She had a gorgeous formal cocktail dress from them  too, it was so posh
@axania omg I'm so glad it arrived! I've never shipped anything there before so I honestly had no idea but I was getting over-eager lol <PURPLE HEART>
@merggies so I guess as it turns out I also have GERD <NEUTRAL FACE><FACE WITH COLD SWEAT><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@msdictator @VictoriasSecret my former boss had the most gorgeous collection of VS sweaters and dress shirts tbh
@axania any chance your parcel has arrived yet? I confess I don't know the shipping time to there from CA at all, it's been about 2 weeks
@horsetornadoes basically me in cat form
@MsBeeton how is the cat faring??
@xmyrin sometimes it leaves me super drained but then sometimes I'm just like wired up or something
@merggies @tuckermonteith you know what's weird is they never question my Super Pointy nickel plated knitting needles 
@ginalikesthis @horsetornadoes @dickpaws @xmyrin I can't move on with my night until this all gets explained
@Fayehsdiary let me guess, the older parolee? I can never handle that part omfg
@ginalikesthis @dickpaws and I don't even need to make as many socks!
@horsetornadoes @xmyrin whaaat whyyyy? Is it because you feel so guilty about our emotional affair?
@dickpaws hell yeah start with a leg I don't need both lbr
Seriously I get that it's a taboo but for eating your shoes and candles and even dying when you have real nutritious meat boggles my mind.
Cannibalism: If you and I are stranded and I die first, you'd BETTER fucking eat me because I'll be DAMNED if you starve to death needlessly
@katielikesthis but the average person with long hair who using styling crud shouldn't have to trim their ends more than once a month iirc
@katielikesthis A HAIR QUESTION I KNOW THE ANSWER TO it varies really widely from person to person and with how you style and care for it
@goddamnitkelsey is that not how high school dances are anymore? I thought they were all like that since the beginning of time or whatever
@captainboo meant2be on a couch together with snacks, mocking documentary contributors
This year my holiday cards will all have quotes from James Joyce's love letters instead of seasonal greetings you're welcome in advance
@ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey @merggies there's a skill to adding salt to your cooking to enhance flavor tbh, processed foods don't count
Fyi in addition to unfrosted Poptarts I'm also the reason they still make those "gourmet" lollipops displayed on tree stands by the register
I get the much larger pack, and when I see that amount left I think "almost gone, might as well kill it" before dumping the rest in my mouth
The difference between me and healthy people is, you know how much of a junk food is in a single serving pack? Like for chips or something?
I recall liking the show a lot, but just reading a summary of the 3rd season of Elementary is making me roll my eyes and do a jackoff motion
@katielikesthis @ginalikesthis you still have time to get the gray one when it's in stock I bet. Get two so Gina can carry Zephyr Everywhere
@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis definitely the brunette
@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis I genuinely can't see a color difference between the carriers, although I'm assuming there is one
@missjudygreer Also great mixed with bread crumbs for chicken or pork chops!
@katielikesthis you're lucky, I almost went with which mom
@katielikesthis the bottom baby, he looks more like he has your coloring
Me. I'm the reason they still make unfrosted PopTarts. Ha, haha, fuck you all.
Dr: What do you mean "emotionally frail"?
Me: It's SO AWFUL how mean everyone is to the little snot man in Mucinex ads
Dr: Here's a referral
@alexiconofstars I will ask the tough questions, like "do you believe we must one day leave our corporeal forms?" and "are you tax exempt?"
@alexiconofstars People forget his group was pretty active for a long time, well before they moved to Jonestown!
@captainboo solar powered turtleneck jumpsuit, reef shark, Halloween bathroom accessories, one of those appliances that only makes corndogs
I honestly hope I never am rich because 1. I'd never ever be able to enjoy it and 2. I'd spend it on the stupidest shit by general standards
@katielikesthis babywearing group??
Got followed by a Justin Bieber Twitter &amp; a Katy Perry Twitter, so maybe we can go for a trifecta and throw, like, U2 or Lady Gaga in there
@coralisawesome they can, especially if it's a sinus headache!
@wtvoc And isn't that the Real American dream
@wtvoc Lee's what what
@afamilyoftrees @modernwest @mrbobodenkirk @petergould god damn it
@alexiconofstars I really liked that one even though I don't like Jon Krakauer!
You wouldn't think it possible, but I am so terrible at napping. I spend more time getting around to the nap than others do actually napping
@merggies seriously that comment would only even make logical sense if it was directed at your aunt, not your mom
I'd just use an anthro degree for credibility telling people there's an evolutionary reason they want to bite &amp; pinch other people's babies.
Case proven: The kid is now wandering around squealing loudly instead, and I feel nothing but relief.
@msdictator @MrScottEricson I love that it's still two stars instead of just one
THIS WOMAN USING A LOUD CARTOON ON A TABLET TO OCCUPY HER KID IN THIS WAITING ROOM lady your kid talking loudly would not be less irritating
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis well when he needs someone to narrate the audio book, I've been told I'm very resonant for a tenor js
@wtvoc it will be a fun (for you) learning experience for him when all of this falls through by, like, lunch time.
Is there anywhere online to find reviewers of specific audio book narrators, because I've noticed there's like a core group of them
@ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey @horsetornadoes so if you weren't pregnant do you just end up with a dermoid cyst
@thevulva so you and drake have something in common
@horsetornadoes @goddamnitkelsey what about babies both with that all-over fuzzy hair, or neonatal teeth

ok so wear less makeup, tf does that have to do with me
@ginalikesthis that's because you and I are basically low key aspiring villains
@horsetornadoes mine are <PARTY POPPER><OK HAND SIGN><UNAMUSED FACE><GRIMACING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><FISTED HAND SIGN>
@fixedfocused okay I loled
@ginalikesthis sometimes I suspect I'm conflating "rich" with "middle class" tbh, or at least "upper middle class".
Ever known someone who believed they were unique &amp; charmed, w/ a fascinating life, but really they were just white and 23, w/ rich parents?
@merggies @ginalikesthis 
@xmyrin see, you put those two things together and it could not /be/ less cool
@horsetornadoes @neiltyson mentally I've already unread this tweet and blocked it from my brain 3:
@neiltyson DID THE GUINEA PIG LIVE?
@ginalikesthis Nope. Well, sometimes the toddlers they use are pretty bad. I get the feeling Blake Lively is uncompelling irl as well though
@ginalikesthis @breesrants sometimes the copyright holder straight up just refuses to sell at any reasonable price, too. It's weird.
After that very first time it was used, no one has ever sounded anything more than stupid saying or write the word "fleek" earnestly.
Pinnacle adulthood is using the same shotglass for Pepto Bismol that you were earlier using for actual shots
Haha Hillary Clinton is assertive and a leader let's joke about her genitalia which no one has ever done before
My dad is probably thinking that in retrospect he maybe shouldn't have demonstrated so much knowledge of Kate Upton in conversation with me.
@ginalikesthis @xmyrin no one should ever be asked to contain their love of cheese
@merggies how can you make that shit a tradition like what happens when THEIR kid gets married
@merggies w o w
@tuckermonteith Yeah everyone said the same! Now, what shampoo should she used to help preserve the color??
@primawesome Fucking icebacks, coming into our country like a bunch of "eh"holes, chugging their Molson like the brewery was freezing down!
@xmyrin lolol
I guess when a nurse is showing you how to do an at-home IV they don't think it's funny to ask about using an air bubble to murder your mom.
@horsetornadoes EXCEPT WE'RE IN NEBRASKA
Dying at this 8 year old kid getting his hair cut, "My mom says I should get a 'man bun'!"
@captainboo Yeah okay that makes sense! Thank you for your help!
Hey, does anyone know whether my mom should wash her hair or not before having it dyed today? Do you go in with clean hair or day old hair?
"I should do this" I think to myself, immediately before not doing something.
@amortentia No joke, I actually gasped out loud. It's so beautiful  ;_;
@fixedfocused I def screen all her series finales to avoid disaster. To this Day she hasn't seen the last episode of Morse, Frost or Poirot.
Also I don't have enough yarn to make these taller than ankle socks fffffffff
@merggies block block block
I honestly have no idea what to do about this; she's still really emotionally sensitive post surgery and she gets SO ATTACHED to characters.
I've just found out that this show my mom likes had almost the entire cast turning over in the most recent season, which she just started.
@MsBeeton That is so fucked up :| Is the cat basically okay, all cleaned up and whatnot?
@MsBeeton is that a bb pellet? what kind of asshole shoots a cat with a bb gun
Why is it so fucking cold in this store?? I feel like my nipples could cut glass
@xmyrin @katielikesthis I will not do it even within earshot of anyone, ever, I'm not even 100% sure why but NOPE.
@ginalikesthis @merggies Just seeing the pics Merg posts of her schedule calendar is enough to raise my blood pressure negl I couldn't do it
@katielikesthis every single relationship I've ever been in, this is an unspoken rule that was never broken, nor will I ever allow it to be.
@ginalikesthis @merggies Yeah I'm not shocked your bp is high either, you have a super tough gig right now and I bet it's stressful as fuq
@horsetornadoes just like, plenty of mainstream adult entertainers have that look now
SuicideGirls is still a thing?
@dickpaws @tuckermonteith THIS.
@tuckermonteith I think maybe it's if they're more brown-green than gray-green or blue-green idk
@horsetornadoes @megangarber they weren't wrong about most of that :x
See also this fun pic of my Nonny I found in an old school family photo album 
Actual magnet taken from my parents' fridge, in case you were wondering where my being a complete shitheel comes from 
@ginalikesthis omg
@givemoneynow I got carded yesterday buying my mom cigarettes and had to go back to the car to get my ID :/
@captainboo agreed
@ginalikesthis @xmyrin @katielikesthis I already almost invariably correct people (nicely though)
Pretty Sure I'm Gonna Barf: The Story Of Morning Exhaustion
Comedy lightning round: How quickly can you change what you intended with a joke to match what the listener seems to have gotten out of it??
@sheena__is @captainboo @LivEchonews I'm glad he didn't, too. Jfc!
@sheena__is @LivEchonews holy shit wow. WOW.
R.I.P.
Here Lies Julian
1984 - yarn
Yeah I got nothin
@amortentia omg but I bet they were awesome huh??
@thevulva His wiki page includes references to both "Longtime friend Bette Midler" and "Close friend Liz Taylor" so idk what the mystery was
@MsBeeton Kind of like wholesale? Never hurts to ask! If so, wish we'd known that, could've saved bundles with my uncle's family
@MsBeeton At least you can carpool and/or save a trip?
Sleep? Nah.
@merggies @ginalikesthis No an O isn't a grading option we're going to stick with the regular A thru F system. You're off to a rough start.
@afamilyoftrees I blame antidepressants, personally RT@TheEconomist Deaths from police shootings:
America 458
Germany 8
Britain 0
Japan 0
@captainboo right right yes exactly we don't want them forgetting that!
He died doing what he loved I guess RT @TheAVClub: Some guy punched Marilyn Manson in the face at a Canadian Denny’s 
@captainboo Also maybe articles reminding them they're probably wearing the wrong bra size and that they can burn fat more efficiently idk
There should probably be more magazine articles making women question the solidity of their relationships and what he REALLY wants in bed.
I figure if I'm going to talk to myself I should probably at least do me the courtesy of listening to me and yet
@afamilyoftrees <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> YEEEAAAAHHHHHHHH
I love how my mom watches all these gritty true crime &amp; paranormal investigation shows &amp; the narrators have the exact same dead serious tone
@breesrants omg ty I really needed that. You're okay too, I promise ♡
@horsetornadoes what should we do
Can't sleep, overwhelmed by anxiety and loneliness
@xmyrin @merggies and when you sing the "me" that's when you do an up note and also hit them with the taser
@xmyrin ♡♡♡♡
Also I'm not really down with being touched at all generally but maybe I could use someone patting me on the head and saying "you're okay"
Well my mom is enjoying Lizzie Borden Chronicles so I guess all you haters can suck shit p.s. Christina Ricci and Clea Duvall are goddesses
@merggies @ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey yeah but fundatory could just as easily been almost any other activity and you'd have done that.
@merggies @ginalikesthis @goddamnitkelsey baseball is most fun to go to, football is most fun to see people lose their shit over on twitter.
@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis @merggies I want to go to there.
@fixedfocused yeah sure, I'm down
@fixedfocused Well when you've come to terms with it, like an adult, let me know and we'll go glob Vaseline under their car's door handles.
@MsBeeton that's awesome but I bet also mildly alarming at times haha
@msdictator I forgot to say this before because I am a goofus but it looks so ace!
@MsBeeton Do you ever get stuck behind tractors? I do all the time here and it b l o w s
@neiltyson To be fair, before that it was used to describe the power and presence of God, so really it's been a slow decline I guess
If all I ever posted again was hand-knit socks and stupid esoteric cross stitches, how long would you… 
I contemplate this while eating leftover chicken. What I'm trying to say is, I'm an emotionally shredded hypocritical loser.
Yesterday I intentionally killed a house centipede and today I still feel so guilty I'm thinking about donating all of my things to charity.
@merggies sounds like you shouldn't bother with the U.S. one anymore either lol
@merggies are you watching the U.K.or U.S. shameless
@fixedfocused @xmyrin what now huh 
Battle of Five Armies: longest movie ever?
@ginalikesthis @merggies 
@merggies @xmyrin I liked the movie! Just really not the show like at all lol
@merggies @xmyrin (hides)
@merggies @xmyrin actually I kind of straight up don't really like joss whedon?
@merggies @xmyrin lol I solidly dislike the show Buffy :x :x :x
People think Passover is the Jewish Easter but no, the coming week's candy clearance is the Jewish Easter.

Okay number two spot, lbr number one spot is always the nearest Whole Foods parking lot
If I were a drug dealer the Levi Carter Lake Park parking lot by the Omaha airport would be like my number one pick for sales meetups
@ginalikesthis it's like the irl equivalent of Amazon product suggestions after questionable searches
So you feel real bad for yourself today but consider this: Target check out gave me mayonnaise coupons for the third shopping trip in a row.
@dickpaws mmm yessss
Lol whoops sorry Passover, totally forgot you this year; good thing I'm second oldest son amirite
Or imagine being magically whisked away to Omaha! Hi... I'm in... Omaha. 
Elementary is the first show that's ever legitimately made me wish I could handle watching something with frequent reference to heavy drugs
@xmyrin @msdictator @merggies my friend says it's even better stuffed crust but we just got it on an extra cheese pizza and it was very good
@msdictator @merggies it's good jsyk, the pretzel crust
Mom calling her toddler's kid's bear "your Build A Bear": Lady, no one on this plane cares what brand that bear is, least of all your kid.
I used to be a funny person. I swear to Christ, I used to be funny.
@merggies pulled due to severe abscesses, and I haven't seen a dentist since idek when, so you and I are in this shit together (2/2)
@merggies Listen girl when I was homeless I didn't brush/floss regularly for like a year plus, and my mom has had to have teeth (1/2)
@merggies because the back ones are not visible to other people and it's cheaper to pull teeth
@merggies @ginalikesthis You can help counteract this with a toddler brush (softest bristles) and a toothpaste with a lower RDA (grittiness)
@merggies @ginalikesthis For cavities I mean. Tooth abscess in a five year old? That shit's fucked up.
@merggies @ginalikesthis honestly a lot of it is genetics and whether or not you breath through your mouth, it turns out
@fixedfocused It's the perfect plan until they find out anything about my own life! Lol
@fixedfocused Best of luck to them both! Next time he should wash his hands with baking soda beforehand!
@fixedfocused did she try putting something like Pepto Bismol or baking soda on it to counteract the oils from the pepper?
Woah what they're making a movie of The Great Gilly Hopkins?
@katielikesthis drugs
@axania Alright then! Better dm it to me just in case :) Any u.s. candy or other treats I can toss in for you, as well?
@captainboo @axania @sheena__is Right, I forgot, to which address shall I ship? Directly to Omma? Or someone else, since she's moving soon?
oh okay 
Llorando
It's just sad watching the Church of Scientology not understand how far they've fallen behind w/ modern media and that they're floundering..
@ginalikesthis lmao yes you do
@ginalikesthis The better kids? How many kids are there?
@givemoneynow listen, I shit several times a week and you don't see me going around calling it "creating something", so idk why they get to.
Man isn't is so great how making fun of things other people create is WAY easier than creating your own things? Like wow, what a side path.
@axania Pft, I just made some gifts, you made an entire damn kid! So glad you like everything though! Will send it along straightaway! &lt;3 &lt;3
@captainboo Great, less than a month old and already getting more play than me haha
@captainboo Are those lipstick kisses on his forehead lol
@merggies You think that but you would be truly depressed by how many universities and colleges that could easily be based on :(
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis @merggies oshi-
@ginalikesthis @wtvoc @merggies Don't worry Kristen just says that once in a while to cover our affair, pretending we don't bone on the reg.
bold words, apostate mage RT@fuckeveryword: fuck chantry
"Someone's in here!"
*jiggling stops*
I bet you could write out/pretty much anything like this/and people would assume it's from/a song or poem they don't know/and never check
I didn't think there would or indeed could be a sexier audio book of The Art of War than the Joe Mantegna one, but apparently I was wrong!
@captainboo @axania so, so true
@captainboo YOU CANNOT STOP ME NOMNOMNOMNOMmmmmm mac and cheese glorious mac and cheese (ty ty)
@axania Theoretically? Half of it is supposed to be for someone else who's not home. Will that stop me? Only time will tell (no, it won't).
I'm feeling real contrarian and rebellious so I need someone to tell me not to eat this entire pot of mac and cheese
Lbr, truthfully everybody was already pretty much ignoring Indiana anyway
Coconut water: Nope! You can’t stop pretending it’s good yet!
@merggies ty ;_;
@merggies I KNOW WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHAT IS MY TASTE IN MEN I SWEAR I HAVE GOOD TASTE WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN okaymaybenotthemeither BUT WHY
@merggies Also I got to the end and I still ship her with Søren. Ben Miller: yes I would.
@merggies Tom Waits and The Cars and Junior Senior on this soundtrack though what even
@merggies In the days of Google she never would have followed up on this after looking his ass up
@merggies So far I ship him and Julia Stiles tbh
@torsstupidmouth I hate when I'm playing with my dad and he suddenly pulls out a word like idk "portend"
@merggies so I paused the movie and am just getting back to it and man Ben Miller has not aged in the past fifteen years like at All
@captainboo Americans are such suckers
@captainboo Amazing! My friend faked a British accent at his telemarketing job and got highest sales in his department
@merggies I'll be like of yeah she sobbed her fucking head off at the ending when the... person... died?
@merggies bail now I will back you up later if you claim to have watched the whole thing
@merggies WATCH GOLD DIGGERS: SECRET OF BEAR MOUNTAIN INSTEAD TBH
Everyone in my immediate family is also a sack of shit troll, just fyi
I dated a British guy my freshman year and my brother successful convinced people he was the York of Wales, like that was his royal title.
They make royalty in films be from nonexistent countries or ones virtually unknown in the U.S. so they can fudge the accents, I'm sure of it
@merggies WHAT in the everloving heck are you watching??
@merggies Wow! So it's got even more in common with Bring It On than I initially thought.
@merggies Does this guy playing Eddie ever have any other film roles besides this? The Prince and Me 2 doesn't count.
@merggies @tuckermonteith That's what my doctor says!
@merggies @tuckermonteith I'm like the last person to judge you, honestly. I went to bed at like 6pm and woke up at 11pm
Know how in Stand By Me, Gordie's parents wish he'd died instead of his brother? I bet a lot of 1D fans feel that way about Zayn and Niall.
@merggies Also lol what time did you get up today? It's down to you and me again unless @tuckermonteith shows up drunk at some point
@merggies sweet deal, I'm on it!
@merggies I liked bring in on and ten things I hate about you and that ilk so it seems like it might fit
@merggies listen I don't want to get too real on here but I wanted to ask: should I watch The Prince and Me?
@amortentia Yeah, I wonder if it's because she's still "not missing" even now, so maybe it's too sensitive a situation?
@amortentia Definitely, there's a lot of stuff they didn't cover. Shit's wild.
@merggies @ginalikesthis @tuckermonteith I bet she'll SLAY in Ghostbusters tho
@merggies @ginalikesthis @tuckermonteith She co-wrote Tammy though?
@givemoneynow @EtTuBlair every time I so much as see this again in my mind I start laughing
@prettiestflower Oh Christ no. So far he seems to like me okay, I don't want to risk screwing that up.
AHHH
@captainboo and Michael Ian Black stole two of my jokes!
@xmyrin @ginalikesthis No one is going to judge you, bridesmaids aren't always single anymore and people know that. You'll be fine!
So you guys may not have noticed, but I had an Intense twitter celebrity encounter. That's right, @JustinGuarini favorited TWO of my tweets.
If you preordered the video game Bloodborne on PS4 the in-game bonus gear was legit a fedora. I almost feel like someone did that on purpose
Irony: defective arms now hurt too much to write
#nailedit in case you were wondering 
@merggies no you were probably right the first time
@merggies good luck! It's the only thing that works on our dog bed covers tbh
The $1 hello kitty notebook I'm using as a journal unsurprisingly fell apart so I'm sewing it together in coptic or Japanese stab binding
@merggies Did you try just totally caking places like the armpits in damp baking soda and just letting it sit a long ass time?
Someone Photoshop an American flag or something in there RT @PopularPugs: raise your hand if you love pugs 
@coralisawesome stoked to see the final result of your cosplay fyi!
"How do I meet people to encourage me and comfort me and keep me company and do stuff with me?"
"Do you mean friends?"
"...Do I??"
@xmyrin @fixedfocused the kind that come in separate pieces you assemble!
Crudbuckets it's nice out this morning
U.K. I am moving to you and opening a legit taqueria, and you will all thank me. How do I Kickstarter this?
@givemoneynow actual screencaps of that debate 
@captainboo I'm definitely listening to it right now haha
@captainboo 
@captainboo and yet somehow the only follower I gained was a Gossip Girl quote Twitter
@amortentia Thank you!
@fixedfocused if you do, hook me up with some of those little soda bottle ones, and also do they make peach rings
@fixedfocused gummy candy is the best candy, end of.
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, but then I thought, should I really just Thoreau my life away like that?
We're not so different, you and I. We all prefer Riker with the beard, and we all hate parallel parking.
@fixedfocused Careful, that's a bold proclamation that might challenge the pharmaceutical industry! ;)
@seanonolennon In fact I probably should have just referred you to this like thirty tweets ago at this point 
@seanonolennon And I think I will follow you! No need to follow back, you're famous, &amp; my Twitter is almost all bad jokes and social justice
@fixedfocused luckily I think we've mellowed. My arguments always seem to end this way. Am I doing it wrong?
@seanonolennon And I do think pot should be legal and I'm sure a very large part of why it's not is the tobacco and pharmaceutical lobbies.
@fixedfocused I should've just referred him back to this like twenty posts ago


@seanonolennon I'm not trying to debate you anymore, I am just venting in solid commiseration here.

@seanonolennon Yeah, me neither. It takes a bit of digging, but you can find research articles with solely nonpartisan funding.
@seanonolennon And if you don't feel comfortable discussing that in a public forum but still want to exchange, you've got my email too :)
@seanonolennon Here: I find that opinion interesting. Why do you choose to focus on psychiatric drugs specifically, do you suppose?
@seanonolennon I can keep rephrasing the question until it suits you, I honestly don't mind. I truly am interested in your personal feelings
@seanonolennon So you're not so much Jewish as Jew-ish? ;)
Am I actually in a fight with Sean Lennon right now
@seanonolennon Okay please allow me to start over?

That is a strong opinion, Sean. Why are you focusing on antidepressants specifically?
@seanonolennon (Sorry, aiming for levity because I really didn't want this to turn into a stupid Twitter fight)
@seanonolennon Clearly you don't have a Jewish grandmother
@seanonolennon Well if you want to get that technical, I never said you thought you were holier-than-thou, I said you were acting like it.
@seanonolennon I guess I'm mostly wondering why, of all the many societal and psychological factors at play, you're singling out this one.
@seanonolennon don't tell me, let me guess, you're sorry if I was offended?

@afamilyoftrees @seanonolennon u no, the u.s. also has a greater income gap and sense of class privilege than most other western countries..
@afamilyoftrees @seanonolennon kind of impressed by how authoritatively holier-than-thou his replies are, I missed his getting an MD or PhD
@seanonolennon @H329Rk yes that is definitely the only difference between the U.S. and other countries, not the gun laws/access or anything.
@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis PLUS he's one of those assholes who refuses to pick but then doesn't like anything you suggest
@ginalikesthis @horsetornadoes I haven't had Wendy's in years, I don't even know their menu anymore aside from the standards.
@horsetornadoes @ginalikesthis Wendy's is a real answer so I went with that, because I am very food-impressionable
DJ asked me what fast food he should bring home and I find this as paralyzing as when I tried to write a mission statement for grad school.
Me: I think we're to the stage where we should get matching tattoos
Tattoo artist: You literally just walked in here
@merggies I read this as Merging with a hard g can that be a verb RT@SPACEPlCS here you see NGC 6240 Merging galaxies 
I bet being hairy is kinda fun like when you shower you get to be your own loofah
@alexiconofstars sup
Oh look me awake by myself at 5am with no one to talk to and nothing I feel like doing who woulda thunk it
@givemoneynow HAVE YOU PLAYED PUZZLE AGENT 1 &amp; 2? There are torrents for the pc versions, it's like Professor Layton meets Twin Peaks/Fargo!
@merggies lbr everyone is probably too busy being paranoid about their own social media presence
@merggies ohhh I see 3:
@merggies BUT your account is locked isn't it?
@ginalikesthis of course not, and I always leave my bumbershoot and walking stick by the door
@ginalikesthis I AM WEARING AN ARGYLL CARDIGAN I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
@ginalikesthis I like to think I balance it out by doing stuff like getting high at the park at 4am while listening to synth
@ginalikesthis yes this comes as a great shock to us all I am sure I mean no one had ever thought that about me before so
HahahaHAHAHA Target I KNEW you'd give up on the idea of textiles and put all your sewing fabric on closeout MWAHAHAHAHA #bidingmytime
@merggies @ginalikesthis see I have this problem where I get super overwhelmed and anxious when I have too many options :x
@merggies How was it? It's my friend's birthday so we went to Red Robin but we did look at the Stacked menu online for a hot minute lol
Red Robin busboy looking like Liam Hemsworth with a half man bun
@merggies @sarapvilla how is that place?
Friday night already? Gosh, where DOES the time go
@merggies those were the school's official ones they gave out I mean
@merggies since the UCSC mascot is the banana slug/motto is Fiat Lux, we had yellow condoms with Sammy Slug and "Fiat Latex" on the wrapper
The pencil box I've been using since my freshman year R.A. knowingly handed it to me, full of pamphlets and condoms. 
@xmyrin @merggies Right? Nobody's pretending that shit's good for you but neither is regular coke, hard liquor, most dairy, coffee drinks...
@merggies I want to know exactly what people think chemicals are. Everything is chemicals, you guys. We are comprised of chemicals.
@merggies omg lol
You know that point in an argument when it's more about winning than the actual topic? That's health blogs and Diet Coke.
Now it's like people are Furious you won't stop drinking Diet Coke because they said to, more than any real concern over a stranger's drink.
@afamilyoftrees what kind of asshole cheaps out and doesn't even spring for real grinch poop is all I'm saying
If you're figuring I haven't used that move to seduce someone you don't really know me all that well.
(At a job interview)
"For skills, you list 'Doing the I Would Die 4 U hand motions in sync with the music'?"
(I demonstrate)
"You're hired."
@JustinGuarini @NutritionAmanda You really pulled off that kale though
Also yes I was sober. The only sober person there. In case you were wondering. Idk why the host offered me weed like immediately after that.
Later in the night I was bored, peeling at the little homemade label, then suddenly exclaimed, "HEY wait a minute! These are just TICTACS!!"
It was an hors d'oeuvres party. I didn't know anyone. Also my brother hadn't told me to dress nice so I was wearing a child's dinosaur shirt
As a little gag party favor his friend gave out green mint TicTics with a homemade label that read "Grinch poop" over the real one.
This past Christmas when I was in Omaha my brother and his wife felt obliged to invite me to their friends' holiday season dinner party.
@merggies fancy shampoo and candy and something bright and shiny
@captainboo It's mega illegal but my landlord doesn't speak English &amp; I don't speak Vietnamese so the only real recourse would be moving out
@ginalikesthis order a vintage "collectable" one from a German site that will ship to MD and just sharpen the absolute hell out of it
@ginalikesthis Just owning it has improved the quality of my life 20% in that I'm no longer afraid to go out or walk around by myself tbh
@ginalikesthis What format do you use? I bet Merg I know the answers to your queries
@ginalikesthis I have a well sharpened illegal switch blade but I really shouldn't need it just to get a soda from the fridge Jesus Christ
@ginalikesthis I literally have no idea who this guy is and I don't think my landlord really knows him either
@ginalikesthis He's not white and prob Wayne-free but he also doesn't speak any English and is very big and is it weird that I'm scared-ish?
stranger who will be living in our living room starting tonight like right now which is also the first we heard of it (2/2)
I fucking dare any of you to try and tell me your landlord is worse than mine. Just try, and I will tell you about the male total (1/2)
ARE
YOU
FUCKING
KIDDING
ME
UNIVERSE
@merggies @ginalikesthis omggggggg pigulous!
@merggies it costs more and that sucks but it's worth it if it helps!
@merggies dude give it a shot and then conditioner if you want and you might see a real difference! I'm serious yo, try t-gel or something!
@merggies I feel like I've already asked but what shampoo do you use/have you tried something with coal or pine tar?
I just want my fucking arms to hold out long enough to finish this baby present is that really so much to ask? IT'S ALMOST DONE WHY THE PAIN
Why does Netflix think mystery is interchangeable with crime thriller and suspense? There's a specific plot device, it's in the genre name.
@fixedfocused I watched the tv movie and really liked it then was wary to watch the show when I saw it was totally different. You recommend?
"...But his true gift, his modern super-ability, was being able to tell which tweets the poster would delete later. That and screencapping."
@merggies damn, that's also my go-to trick for leftovers.
@merggies by putting them in a paper bag and labeling it "kombucha quinoa yeasts" or something so she definitely won't check it at all
@merggies then hang them in the bathroom while you shower to steam out any wrinkles just fyi (2/2)
@merggies @ginalikesthis For even less effort and equal results you can also just put them in the freezer overnight to kill bacteria, (1/2)
@merggies me with showing and brushing my teeth every single day
@horsetornadoes you can skip like the last three or four though and just catch the last maybe two of the final season plus the movies
My brain's like Pavlov's dogs, processing that I'm applying lotion and all like "Oh hey I strongly crave something in a screw lid container"
@merggies ... 
Took three whole days from that Noam Chomsky quote Twitter to give up and unfollow me, I feel like he'd have recognized a lost cause sooner.
@merggies WHAT I SAID MY B COME ON HERE
@merggies my b
Man dads are like toddlers they are the biggest shits ever but then they can be so goddamn adorable sometimes
@merggies Trick Chip into showing up, then throw him to the wolves
@merggies just be like "maybe they do have an unfair advantage but let's make it uncomfortable and unsatisfying for them as they so deserve"
@merggies ruining things, the hallmark of MLA format tbh
@fixedfocused The series or the very different stand alone tv movie of the same name with the same cast?
@merggies feel free to use it for promotional materials and motivational posters and the like
@merggies "In conclusion, fuck the white patriarchy. Don't make it any easier for those assholes!"
WHAT IF IT'S ME?? WHAT IF /I'M/ THE GOOD DOG?!
@fixedfocused Don't fret, my pet! At this point in my life changing is unlikely.
I always feel so bad for my Twitter friends when they stumble into a territory I have strong opinions concerning. :x
The first rule of fantasy/sci-fi/action badass fashion is that the belt must be slung symmetrically and serve no real purpose. Also: BUCKLES
@merggies Like those are hilariously bad and embarrassing things to have happen, like losing weight is Very Paramount because dear god, etc
@merggies I get you, I loooove overhearing cis females joking that they look like a man in drag or jokes about a cis male who "has no balls"
@merggies belch super super loud to interrupt
@primawesome please report back on how many followers you lose just for posting this
I hope to hell that whoever designed this damn octopus is at least making some good money off its ubiquity. 
@Fayehsdiary Truth. Sometimes I don't know how I make it through seeing movies in theatres.
@Fayehsdiary I almost invariably hit mute. Actually I do that for most second-hand awkward moments.
@merggies spoiler alert it never really feels wholly doable then either because you feel like you can't leave your work undone, &amp; the stress
@merggies @ginalikesthis PERFECT
@merggies @ginalikesthis And THAT is EXACTLY the fundamental problem with the trial-by-peer-jury system in a purely capitalist society t b h
@merggies @ginalikesthis show up in a shirt that says FEMINAZI KILLJOY in big letters, or any common/recognizable sjw Twitter hashtag
@ginalikesthis @merggies lbr though white people ARE murderers. That's exactly why the D.A. aim for white-stacked juries on capital cases.
@merggies @ginalikesthis I have it on good authority that casually referring to being a newly recovering addict ensures very fast dismissal.
@merggies excused. I've had jury duty for like 3 months now lol (2/2)
@merggies true story: you can actually just keep using their website to postpone it indefinitely, and also it's super easy to get (1/2)
Is that rpattz on the left

It is, isn't it 
@merggies if you're mad about the cliffhanger, and idk why I know this, I think it's already been spoiled?
Another bonus challenge with playing Words With Friends against a parent is that they will realize you're by your phone and try to call you.
@fixedfocused @ginalikesthis I am a wise old soul but with the fun immaturity of a recalcitrant teenager!
@horsetornadoes you run a risk entrusting her with your clothes
@fixedfocused Learn from my experience though. Remember to take the binder clips off.
Playing Words With Friends against your parent is extra challenging in that you have to keep it even without ever ever letting them catch on
@horsetornadoes but what does babycat think of it?
@MsBeeton haha I hope this is helpful and not making it worse D:
@MsBeeton You can also just do $40/$65 (.615whatever, about 62%) and subtract that number from 100 (You still get 38%!) if that's easier.
@MsBeeton $25/$65
=.3846blahblahwhatever 
so about 38%.
@MsBeeton That's what getting rid of the decimal point does. Say something is normally $65, on sale for $40. That's a $25 difference, right?
@givemoneynow I used to think nostril rim but then one time I got one on my eyelid and it was the deep kind. Anything on cartilage ughhhh
@MsBeeton That's such a convoluted way to describe that! Just divide the smaller number by the bigger one and get rid of the decimal point
Alright, damn it, let's settle this once and for all: What is the Worst place to get a zit?
Do you think of tons of jokes that are bigoted and you're not the right minority to make them? Television writing may be right for you!
@fixedfocused put in the back corners first and binder clip them in place, then shake it out and the duvet cover falls into place!
@axania Damn it! This is what I get for not planning ahead...
Pretty sure I know the answer already but Just In Case: is there any way known to science that some else can shower and go to my appt for me
And I don't mean sexy in general, I mean appealing to their partners specifically. Why can't this be an industry the way the inverse is?
Men need to start having an absolute shit ton of anxiety about remaining sexually attractive to their girlfriend/wives. It's time, you guys.
@merggies ADULTHOOD
@merggies Yeah I have a doctor appointment tomorrow and anxiety over sleep is killing any joys I might have while unable to sleep lol
@merggies Are you working all night tonight? Your schedule seems so all over the place!
@merggies <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@merggies I don't even want to know what results you get with "koala porn" and I really mean that.
@merggies You know what's weird is I didn't even Google "koala sex" to get that pic I just googled "koala".
@merggies Oh they know, Merg. They just don't Care.

@merggies I think of the whole koala clap crisis because it's So Weird!
Can I just say, the worst part is how genuinely impressed everyone is with the goddamn moonwalk.
@merggies @fixedfocused @kewpz Omg I have never told anyone this before Merg but... I am also an armpit virgin
Everyone Else Is Dyeing Their Own Rainbow Sock Yarn And I'm Not: A Tale Of Oppression
Yeah my sleeping brain just invented not only an entire graphic novel series but also a dedicated fandom and many Instagram fan art accounts
Name: Julian
Gender: Male
Age: Getting real cranky about confusing touch screen commands, and also Cracklin' Oat Bran never being on sale
You're allowed to get pissed about an app's permissions and complain to me only if/when you understand what they mean and why they are bad
@merggies (@ginalikesthis) ...real talk tho, I totally own that shirt
Always a Barton, never a Chelmey
@merggies @ginalikesthis also don't worry I put you in my phone as Merg
@ginalikesthis @merggies I came back to this convo after getting a drink only to snort Diet Coke into my sinuses with contained laughter
@ginalikesthis @merggies I want you to know I exercised restraint and made that a regular forward facing emoticon
@ginalikesthis @merggies brb photoshopping horns onto her phone contacts pic OH WAIT MERG ISN'T IN MY CONTACTS BECAUSE SHE MUST HATE ME :'(
@merggies that sounds blasphemous merg idk
@SimpsonsQOTD (cocks gun) I said, hop. in.
@merggies BUT IS MAGIC KOSHER
@merggies technically if they haven't been approved and blessed they aren't since we don't know what they eat sooooo
@merggies You didn't know that??
@merggies You get used to it. This is a much more flattering shot of me though! 
@merggies I remember that night! Man you can really tell I was so creeped out by what the dude next to me was wearing and how he grabbed me.
I for one am thankful to ModCloth for taking the time to find someone who looks vaguely like Kate Middleton to model all their fascinators.
@captainboo Update: Apparently I also missed a truly magnificent Billy Idol cover entitled "It's A Nice Day For A Cat Wedding". Blast!
@givemoneynow Now that Nintendo has said they're making smart phone games, I'm hoping they'll port all those games to Android as well!
@givemoneynow I've gained access to a 3ds xl and DJ knows how to put roms on it, and it's heaven <EYES> I want to play All The Games!
@givemoneynow Have you played this Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright crossover game?? If so, thoughts?
WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO BE KAWAII AND SCHMUTZ KEEPS STICKING TO YOUR PASTEL GLITTER TAPE

"Are you talking back to a Weezer song?"
"This song is old enough to vote"
(poignant silence)
@merggies @ginalikesthis @katielikesthis I accept this challenge
@fixedfocused <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@fixedfocused um I believe u mean #blessed
@katielikesthis @ginalikesthis @merggies if it makes you feel better people actually meet me in person and still think I'm a decade younger
@afamilyoftrees lbr DJ deserves that half the time anyway BUT HE WON'T STOP INSISTING IT WAS THE 1999 JAM OF THE YEAR
At Five Guys and DJ is demonstrating his moonwalk for the staff, to Len's "Steal My Sunshine". Let this tweet serve as my suicide note.
Gonna start telling people I'm the heir to the Dress Barn fortune probably
It's amazing that someone decided to name a clothing chain Dress Barn but what's more amazing still is that it's really succeeded.
Ugh, fuck Andrew Dice Clay. I mean that. Fuck that guy.
My god, the automatic egg cooker is everything and more, honestly. I'm living the egg dream.
@captainboo (don't be fooled by the name, she is an elegant queenly cat) (kind of stubborn tho)
@captainboo If Blousey is into lady cats, maybe we could marry her off to Bill Clinton Two for citizenship exchange! 
@captainboo Honestly I'm so bummed I missed it, especially after seeing the buffet spread.
@captainboo Upon squinting, I'm pretty sure the groom's at least got a bowtie on.
@captainboo It was in NYC so I was stuck with Snapchat. :( The bride was simply ethereal being carried downstairs in her veil, though!
This automatic egg cooker better live up to its reputation that consists of my roommate enthusiastically cooking 7 eggs at a time when drunk
They are feeding each other's cats wedding "cake" just fyi
I thought my friend was joking but she is definitely hosting a cat wedding right now between her cat and her friend's.
The Moogles in Final Fantasy Type-0 have gender neutral pronouns and I feel like it's MEANT to be inclusive but... 
@horsetornadoes All I got was that even living in a van behind a Wal-Mart is unattainable to me because fuck if I have $11,000 js
@merggies @horsetornadoes I feel like this week's weather is some kind of reward for surviving last week's.
@katielikesthis @breecasey yeah, exactly this
@katielikesthis Pretty sure being preg gives you carte blanche to demand and consume any damn thing you want, so use that while you can tbh
@breecasey Eh, I can see into the future where there could be a point when I'm just too spent, which I imagine is where you are now
@tuckermonteith probably yeah, a lot of people just totally converge on deals like that
@breecasey But at the same time she was stealing my meds and money and sneaking out and anyway long story short I know exactly how you feel
@breecasey My mom is a recovering addict and it's like I want to help her and I made sure she made it to the methadone clinic every day etc.
@breecasey I understand, that kind of shit can just be so emotionally exhausting tbh
@tuckermonteith where is the pizza from?
@breecasey <GREEN HEART><GREEN HEART><GREEN HEART>
@breecasey I feel so bad for your grandma (and you and your brother obviously) :(
@merggies 
@merggies "Welp, leaking green stuff and stepped on a rusty nail so prob need to go ahead and get in there for a pap and some booster shots"
@merggies yeah idk what to do except make up a qualifying health problem for every appointment?
@merggies me to give up my exemption. (2/2)
@merggies Well I guess some advisory popped up on her computer that she'd never even seen before. She thinks they're trying to force (1/2)
@merggies lol I tried to schedule a physical and the receptionist advised me that Medi-Cal didn't cover this "type" of appt for me?
@horsetornadoes she's totally being serious about it too, my friend is
I was going to reattempt yesterday today instead but now I'm thinking I'll reattempt yesterday and today tomorrow
Organic cotton candy?? Girl that is literally pure sugar with food coloring there is no way to make this better for you.

@KenJennings "only mountain dew or crab juice" "ewwww I'll take the crab juice"
I had to reinstall my Twitter app and I'm less annoyed about losing my drafts than I am about having to completely redo my 1D blackout list.

Me: Fine, I'll stay up 
Body: No

BRILLIANT PINTEREST AND ETSY PRODUCT PHOTO IDEA: Close aperture shots of white women's cupped hands holding something small in front of them
Because I'm really not that clever tbh
Has anyone else jokingly but accurately referred to The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt as "13 Going On 30 Rock" or did I just make that up?
@fixedfocused @ginalikesthis I, I love carbs like a love song baby
Wait a minute you guys I think this movie might be about lesbians
"Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain" would be a pretty fantastic gay romantic comedy y/y?
AND GOLD DIGGERS: THE SECRET OF BEAR MOUNTAIN?!?
I thought I was a pretty good friend and yet none of you had the decency to tell me Goodburger was on HBO Go, now I don't know what to think
@JustinGuarini @huntigula He'll be damned if he's gonna apologize for diving through that cake though.
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis @merggies also I can make a pretty awesome gorilla shadow puppet
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis @merggies I just realized I totally successfully gainsaid you on this.
Y'all I'm out, I gotta go assemble a prefab table and talk shit on documentary weirdos in the UK and my cell probably doesn't work overseas.
@captainboo I forget who the guy was but he was trying to be all nice to her about the spine thing but also struggling so hard not to laugh.
@captainboo yesssss (gathers up tool bag and Ziploc of assorted Ikea hardware while casually flexing)
@captainboo omg I'm all happy I know who you're talking about
@captainboo is it the Ikea table because no offense but I am the master of Ikea and Ikea hacks
@merggies I honestly am very surprised
It's weird how Tina Fey sure does like her racist humor?
@merggies omg "people with vaginas"
@merggies DJ's boss gave us keys to his housing development's pool which was super nice of him except families with kids so no
Just completely disassembled, thoroughly cleaned, and reassembled a floor-standing portable a/c unit, if anyone is looking for a husband. <FLEXED BICEPS>
@merggies 1. Omg 2. So jealous of that pug right now
This has been a rewarding and enriching Twitter experience for me, you guys! Plus it ends with pizza!
@merggies @ginalikesthis I like to think I was a pro-pizza influence here. Also was it a one time coupon or can other people use it jw
@MsBeeton Flaunting your future privilege!
@MsBeeton There's a really great Italian family cafe here, they barely speak English but the pizza is rad, alas they're closed Sundays.
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis @merggies dude you know pineapple causes anaphylactic shock for me right
@merggies @ginalikesthis Papa John's has a pizza I really like a lot but I forget what it is ;_; Something with white sauce maybe? Spinach?
@ginalikesthis From where? Do you have a preferred chain? My pizza fate is in your hands
@ginalikesthis It is now yes! I fell off the kosher wagon into a big ol pile of bacon cheeseburgers while you were in the military!
What pizza should we get, and from where? Now is your chance to influence me with your personal preferences
What if we spent as much time and effort saving, I dunno, children and nature and neighborhoods as we do for a show that's getting cancelled
@wtvoc also good: white person Amazon reviews of Tibetan prayer flags
Said the grown man who played through the entirety of, and got teary at the end of, a minimally animated children's puzzle game.
I feel like that Professor Layton game ending was a little too late-romantic era tear-jerker for a minimally animated children's puzzle game
@ginalikesthis @merggies this makes logical sense
It was 93°f (34°c) here today you guys. 
@merggies What the fuck is this heat amirite?? I might actually be dead right now.
@ginalikesthis @wtvoc meanwhile Hollywood Video sits in the corner and cried, alone, abandoned, forgotten entirely.
@wtvoc have you noticed that every time you major clean you find blockbuster swag
@ginalikesthis yeah man it breaks up the textural continuity
@horsetornadoes That is exactly it! I don't want hard ass gummies
Gummy worms in frozen yogurt: always better in theory than in practice.
There's no major "Nice Girl" trope because no one expects guys to not prioritize sexual attraction over how much the girl likes them, huh?
@ginalikesthis ain't nothin wrong
If you've pissed me off you'll probably never know but man you don't want to see your contact photo in my phone
@dickpaws @coralisawesome @ginalikesthis @cousinviolet @merggies @curtiseveretts @horsetornadoes @tuckermonteith it's the perfect crime
@merggies omg it is really cute!! Good life decision
@ginalikesthis I hear it's hilarious!
@ginalikesthis I kinda feel bad for him because I have no real doubt he would hate that show and really who could blame him I guess
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt but I bet so many people have already asked him. (2/2)
My friend's boyfriend was raised in a cult he later escaped from as an adult and I kind of want to know what he thinks of (1/2)

@merggies you may have him when I'm done with him but idk how much use he'll be by then
@merggies tied up in my basement <EYES>
Is that a tiny hockey mask RT @gudetama_sanrio 
@tuckermonteith yesssss (blows smoke off finger gun) I used one and it worked fucking perfectly tbh
My phone's Gmail inbox says I have one unread message, which I can't find unless I scroll endlessly or give up and use someone's computer :|
@tuckermonteith WAIT YOU HAVE A IPHONE NEVER MIND
@tuckermonteith 
@horsetornadoes you up, that's what I did with my parents. (3/3)
@horsetornadoes share rooms? and interracial marriage used to be illegal and I don't know just keep ranting until he caves to shut (2/3)
@horsetornadoes Give him this huge impassioned speech about marriage equality and how some couples ~can't get married~ so can they (1/3)
@horsetornadoes You shouldn't have to take a class unless you're getting a carry permit
@horsetornadoes that definitely happens tbh there are some horror stories out there lol D:
@horsetornadoes you'll enjoy the experience of shooting a gun once you've done it tbh, even/especially if you never do it again

@merggies @Fayehsdiary I assume the Grand Cyclops only got the one giant hole cut in the center of his bed sheet hood
@Fayehsdiary @merggies Imperial Wizard, Goblin, Grand Cyclops, Grand Monk, Ghoul, and Hydra were all high ranking positions. Grand. Cyclops.
@ginalikesthis @curtiseveretts o m g   :O
You. Yes, you. Closer. Yes, put your face right up to your screen... I'm gonna drain your life force to get me through this afternoon slump.
Basically I learned my sense of comedic timing from Norm MacDonald, also that is how I explain every joke I make that my family doesn't get.
The host and other guest laughed and moved on, and several seconds later Norm loudly interrupted with "Because he ejaculates prematurely!"
One time Norm MacDonald was a talk show guest and made a 9 1/2 Weeks reference joke about some movie: "More like nine and a half seconds!"
@merggies I hate knowing that he's probably overall a fairly content person
@merggies this Chip guy sounds like the absolute tonic <UNAMUSED FACE>
Each day I play a fun little game where I take my meds, then rush to eat a full meal before my Adderall kicks in and just kills my appetite.
@ginalikesthis @fixedfocused @tuckermonteith Is this an iPhone thing? Are their screens more likely to break?
@ginalikesthis @fixedfocused @tuckermonteith I've never broken a screen which is incredible cause I drop my phones on concrete all the time
@merggies I already live on less than that soooo I think they can probably dealwithit.gif
@merggies we are the oppressed 99% of primarily white middle class youth who were able to attend a fairly high ranking four year university
The very very best people on Twitter are definitely the ones who tell others that someone else has already made that joke. Love those guys.
Me: I have a good life with comfort and people who love me
Depression/anxiety: Good so you're free to focus on the really really minor shit
.@MumfordAndSons I heard that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables.
Card for @horsetornadoes. Love that it's not even an occasion card, it's solely to trash talk. 
Well, missed my appointment to find out my MRI results but at least I have Prince themed cake for breakfast.
@wtvoc who's on a rampage, butternut? They need a little... encouragement to leave you alone? (Cracks knuckles) Ow ow fuck my knuckles ow

Please unfollow me, Eric. Seriously. RT @Eric_the_Bold: Ladies, as evidence of being a courteous lover, I will provide you with kneepads.
@ginalikesthis @barkbox seems legit to me
My bro pointed out that if Michael Caine said "my cocaine" he'd just sound like he was saying his name and I can't stop thinking about this.
Except I think at some point maybe that guy was an actual admiral.
Jed York is like the football team owner equivalent of that guy in Mary Poppins who calls himself Admiral and fires a cannon from his roof.

For breakfast I just want like a vat of fountain Diet Coke, and a strawberry cheesecake so rich it has class privilege.
@witheyesshut @fixedfocused Omg what a wonderful exchange to wake up to! ♡♡♡ you both! That pill bottle is 
s w a n k!
@captainboo They all kind of look the same to me :x
@horsetornadoes honestly Cheezy can be kind of cat-like anyway 
@captainboo they can be kind of mean/bad with small kids in my experience
"Dickety" will never ever stop being funny
Googling "congestion relief" and all these folk in drug forums are worried about using Afrin for their coke nose because it's habit forming?
@merggies Jesus Christ on a cracker!
@merggies She even looks uncomfortable as hell posing :( wild contrast to the other set of great grandparents
YES. Forced misunderstanding is so cheap/lazy. RT@BoobsRadley Fine, I'll say it: fuck Jane Austen, I hate elaborate social misunderstandings
@merggies dat corset tho D:

Yeah,…
So pumped on this yarn tbh 
@tuckermonteith it'd be pretty amazing and also maybe unsettling if she recognized your voice over a shitty intercom saying a few words
My dad and my sister-in-law's dad each have exactly 1 college drug story and it is So Cute to watch them compare notes and feel all hardcore
@tuckermonteith that's so awesome lol
I wouldn't say I "missed" it. RT @TheAVClub: ICYMI: Mumford And Sons' upcoming album won't feature a single acoustic instrument
I didn't know what else to do so I carefully dribbled some of my tea on top of it to mask the mucus and disguise it as a drink spill.
One time I was dropping a final paper off for a class because I had a bad cold and my nose straight up dripped right onto the cover page.
It's so hot today I am physically ill from it.
@SavedYouAClick @Awl I hate myself because I don't get money basically for free?
Just told DJ I need the Chupa Chups limited edition Sarasa pens in the same voice Cruella DeVille uses to rasp "I. WANT. THOSE. PUPPIES!"
@merggies it's only because I'm ~concerned for their theoretical but entirely fictional well being
@merggies does "real women have curves" still apply if they are literally not real pictures of the real women
@RonanFarrow My grandma used to tell me genius is what gets other people to accept and accommodate your craziness #SevenDaysOfGenius
Hel-lo! Wha'd'you think you're doing? Only me and Garth get to talk to the camera. 
@captainboo Probably not, unfortunately... What are you painting? Can you sand off some of the old paint first?
The raddest part of these massive nosebleeds is having coke nose but without having to snort all that pesky blow and have fun first
@captainboo if you can't find one, doing a coat or two of white paint or white primer first works
@horsetornadoes Do you know what happens to your body when you die? Tbh I don't think anyone bothers trying to salvage the clothes afterward
Why am I such a bad offspring
My life is a perpetual state of being pretty sure I USED to be funny but never actually feeling funny

@sorocksteady @dickpaws @horsetornadoes @tuckermonteith @thevulva I kinda want to jump in but dogs are already winning here, nothing to add
@Fayehsdiary omg its sheer depth brings a tear to the eye!
@Fayehsdiary Yes, creative! Unlike me, I colored the gold hooves on my rainbow pony sheets black with a Sharpie because of realism issues...
@dickpaws you leave 'em alone for Five Minutes...
@sorocksteady SEE??
Dang Tweetcaster you just went all over the place with the way you posted those tweets didn't you
@sorocksteady That said I am human garbage and would likely at least consider nailing any man dressed in pastels, florals, and ripped jeans
@sorocksteady basically gpoy me judging myself pretty hard right now 
@sorocksteady 
@sorocksteady 
@sorocksteady like so 
@sorocksteady in theory it's pretty much what it sounds like: pastels, fairy kei and early 90s femme mixed with grunge, punk, and goth
Pastel grunge is such a wonderful aesthetic with such a horrendous demographic
@katielikesthis @tuckermonteith that's how I feel about my Note 4, my friend's iphone 5 looks so miniscule...
@ginalikesthis @CuteEmergency everything was pugs and nothing hurt
@horsetornadoes @katielikesthis well Cheezy is the perfect dog sooo 
@katielikesthis I mean I love them so much I named my dog after them so I for sure feel your pain

@ginalikesthis @katielikesthis ditto
When a joke is strangling you trying to escape but you can't let it out into the world because everyone will know how awful you are
ATTENTION EVERYONE ESPECIALLY @dickpaws

@horsetornadoes @ginalikesthis @sorocksteady Gone are the imperial stout, Jack Daniels, and plastic bottle vodka days of yore. :'(
@horsetornadoes @ginalikesthis @sorocksteady Yeah it SUX, it's not like genetic intolerance, it triggers a histamine reaction in me now. :/
@ginalikesthis @horsetornadoes @sorocksteady With my allergy to alcohol, I now need you all to carry on my good works in the ways of booze.
@ginalikesthis If this is my legacy, I am satisfied with that.
@horsetornadoes I'm not even gonna sugar coat it, that fucking sucks &amp; I feel bad for you, because southern California is an awesome climate
Creggings = corduroy jeggings/skinny jeans and are often super loud both aurally and visually
@ginalikesthis catch it and make margaritas!
@horsetornadoes if it's any consolation we're having a mega bad drought and like everything is dead and brown
@sorocksteady LEGIT. 
@sorocksteady basically, 'round these here parts, if it can be made more kawaii, more Halloween, or both, it probably will be.
This nurse is wearing creggings. Giving it until as late as noon before another hospital employee snaps and kills him... @givemoneynow

DAMN IT
Plus the snoring RT @PopularPugs: word 
@ginalikesthis @merggies but I loooove when ppl try to give the medication is a crutch/use natural treatment/depression is a choice etc talk
@ginalikesthis @merggies tbh I'm kind of crazy. but my parents caught on by middle school and it's been reasonably managed by medication
@horsetornadoes I just woke up and I misread this as you saying you're taking the weather personally
@breecasey @goddamnitkelsey pretty sure the suicide rate in the u.s. has actually been on the decline?
@ginalikesthis @wtvoc @merggies @tuckermonteith I can't be bigoted against Pepsi ~I have friends who are Pepsi drinkers~
@tuckermonteith @merggies @ginalikesthis I can't drink reg. soda, juice, frilly cocktails etc. It's just way too much sugar &amp; hurts my tummy
@ginalikesthis @merggies @tuckermonteith but where do we all stand on diet baja blast mountain dew, available at your finer taco bells?
@merggies diet coke is the only brown soda except sometimes diet dr pepper if I'm feeling zesty
Conan exploring Grindr is a surprisingly rewarding watch
@merggies that's where the diet coke comes in
Scrubbing a dilapidated shower has got to be the least rewarding chore of all time because you know it's never gonna actually look clean. :/
"Would you like that crispy or grilled?"
"Look, I'm getting fast food. Why would I Ever pick the grilled option instead of the crispy?"
@prettiestflower yep
@___paotots @tuckermonteith wait what when did Chipotle stop being your number two jam after chicken strips?
The ultimate throwback Thursday would just be calling it throwback Thor's Day.

@GuyInYourMFA The intense existentialist metaphor that is growing grass on our lawns just to keep mowing it.

Man, MRIs are intense
@amortentia my prayers are with you
Failed long term relationships would be like #60 on my list, wayyy after that time I used the phrase "golden shower" in a class presentation
You'd start with the awkward, embarrassing, shameful moments that you'd love to repress but instead think about every time you have insomnia
The problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is, if you could erase things from your memory you would not start with relationships
@afamilyoftrees There is no help. If you have to drown, at least this is the Titanic you get to go down with.
@captainboo @sheena__is I spent 2 minutes trying to work in a joke at the expense of Marcus Mumford here but I'm tired/sober so I give up
When someone's entire Facebook and Instagram and Tumblr and Twitter are all about their health and fitness I'm happy for them but also bored
How hasn't The Following been cancelled yet? Is anyone actually watching this show?
@GUBLERNATION It's going to be tough to find a bunch of older women over a foot taller than you to awkwardly dance with at this age, though.

"Here, use my Bic." #OffendHannibalIn4Words
@captainboo I would do that, let's be real. I once made a hamster a teeny birthday cake out of plain rice cakes and mashed peas.
@captainboo I get all of my best ideas for how to signal my distress and displeasure from dogs/cats tbh
"Sorry, would have done it into the sink but as you have REPEATEDLY reminded me, no food in the garbage disposal..."
Like she would probably at least back off for a few days don't you think? Maybe?
I bet a great way to get my landlord/housemate to leave me alone would be to barf on her right?
@captainboo It's such a minor thing but it really makes a difference!
It is unreasonable how much my mood can be affected by my available snack options.

Crushing it sock-wise with Noro Taiyo in the S23 colorway and my new sock blockers, both Valentine's…

The internet: "Wow, sometimes blue looks grayish white!"
Colorblind people: "fucking DUH."
@breecasey Yeah that's what I mean, that's got to be really emotionally staggering for you. :/ Hope all is well now
.@merggies The number one thing I have learned from Twitter about the show Friends is that Ross is a mega shitheel
@breecasey jfc! Are you okay?? Is she?
I hate that song so much that it drives me to aspiration, just to one day have access to a forum to espouse my hatred to millions of readers
New life goal is to get famous enough that I can tell @TheAVClub all about why I fucking hate the worst song EVER, Rockabye by Shawn Mullins

You'd think that if an MRI request said "possible brain tumor" Medi-Cal would at least fucking contact the Dr. instead of passively stalling
Headaches, tinnitus and weird strained feeling have been getting way way worse. Now this. Starting to get pretty anxious about it, actually.

Well, guess I better hope it's not a brain tumor. 
Amazon finally posted the first season of Bosch, and me with all this crocheting to do today... what a coincidence...

@amortentia Thank you for answering! I cry at even minor sad things in movies tbh but only very occasionally at happy endings.
@alexiconofstars needs more Liefeld pouches
Thank you again to everyone who responded! That was super nice and helpful of you all. Still looking for answers if anyone else would like!
@teajenna something I'm working on writing wise but also just something I've been thinking about a lot lately I guess
@dickpaws That's very similar to other people's answers, I don't think it's something to be ashamed of! Thank you very much for answering!
@teajenna Oh man thank you so much, that's wonderful! I remember my cousin bawling at Little Mermaid too, she wanted to be just like Ariel.
Anyone else, please? Why do you think you cry at "happily ever after" and roughly how old were you the first time you remember doing it?
@alexiconofstars Excellent, thank you very much! I really appreciate your taking the time to answer.
@afamilyoftrees These are perfect answers thank you very much
@alexiconofstars Any theories as to what triggers it when it happens?
Or, if they don't, let me know that too!
At what age roughly do you think you first cried at a happy ending, and why do you suppose happy endings make you cry?
Open poll, really hoping for answers of any kind:

@axania Doing alright! Sounds like I'm having an easier week than you at the very least, poor thing!

@wtvoc La Brea was totally one of our places to do exactly that instead of going to school lol
@wtvoc Wasn't it the BEST? Non Californians don't know what they're missing.
@sorocksteady If I were on amphetamines this room would definitely be a lot cleaner

@captainboo it only gets worse tbh
@sheena__is @Fayehsdiary @merggies Aw ty! I refuse to back down in my game of chicken with Medi-Cal but I will keep this in mind as backup!♡
@merggies @Fayehsdiary I'm sort of hoping for the tumor tbh cause that's fixable? For now just trying to be foolishly lighthearted about it!
@Fayehsdiary @merggies Still waiting for Medi-Cal to approve the MRIs, because Medi-Cal are callous beasts (who it turns out cover vision!)
@Fayehsdiary @merggies I have an auto immune disorder and they can't figure out what it is, and now I guess I might have a brain tumor idk
@merggies @Fayehsdiary I have an exemption because I'm dying so I didn't have to pick an HMO but I didn't know I could get an eye exam!!

@tuckermonteith Yeah idk if I could deal with the ads. I like Tweetcaster except it's just randomly not showing tweets in my timeline?
In the less than 24 hours I've had Plume it's already screwed up approximately 100% of the time. Are there just no good Twitter apps at all?
@Fayehsdiary fingers very crossed for you both!
@Fayehsdiary Then possibly someone took her inside, no? Maybe she'll be back as soon as she's let out again?

Why are actors "in" movies but "on" shows?
@axania You're officially on maternity leave now though right? And hopefully can take it easy all day? With the help of the cats of course.
@ginalikesthis @merggies @tuckermonteith God bless this convo god bless us all

@merggies @ginalikesthis @tuckermonteith IMO the best part is that you've had it for three years now

@katielikesthis So my friend got Dragon Age: Inquisition and I'm borrowing it and what should I know? Which race/class/whatever did you do??
Remember when Amazon's sole product was BOOKS? Weird.
@merggies My mom hates technology until we're at Starbucks and she's stuck on a crossword clue.
Why awake
@captainboo at this point, in the U.S. a lot of the stores have been forced to offer price matching with Amazon just to stay in business lol
WAIT A GOD DAMN MINUTE, ALL OF THE DAYS END IN Y!
Not saying I've gone downhill intellect wise but my last real "A-HA" moment was when I finally got out the hair I could tell was in my mouth
Oh no wait false alarm whew
@ginalikesthis @merggies There's actual problems, then first world problems, and then there's that person's problems.
Oh no
@sheena__is @captainboo See? We probably are dying.
@___paotots WELL THAT'S ENCOURAGING
@sheena__is @captainboo I've had ones that lasted DAYS, but usually it's not so much blood all at once? I'm flat out dripping over here.
@captainboo UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TOO but that seems unlikely so ty I am comforted ♡
I just blew my nose and seriously about a teaspoon of blood came out am I going to die
@merggies That Tumblr poster is just straight up confusing "feminine" and "conventionally sexy by Western standards".
@merggies Still Caucasian though she should definitely be white as hell
@merggies workplace safety is a tool of the patriarchy Merg. In fact I say we make Rosie even MORE choice feminist

@afamilyoftrees GOOD THE WORLD MUST KNOW THEIR EVIL
@merggies Thanks to Google I now know that Sexy Rosie the Riveter is a very popular Halloween costume, and isn't that kinda weird?
A lot of people I know would have Twitters exactly like Taylor Swift's Twitter if they were even remotely famous.
You guys could never understand how much I hate baby headbands unless you'd also like to gather them into a giant pile and set them alight.
That's not me trying to be funny either btw I really do keep confusing them all
Legit having a hard time keeping all these generically hunky action hero actors named Chris apart. Evans is Captain America right?
@merggies if I achieve nothing else in this life
@merggies baby boomer hippie parents prob, same reason my brother had a coworker named starlight
Probably lots of people sit alone in their room crying and eating McDonalds at 3am right?
@merggies It gets more fun in a few years when they start getting divorced &gt;:3
@ginalikesthis @merggies :'3
@merggies @ginalikesthis oh jk forgiven already omggg
@ginalikesthis @merggies how dare you Merg how
dare

@givemoneynow I'm beginning to suspect their name might be somewhat a misnomer...
@givemoneynow Also, it's not even consistent about which of the two is correct.
@givemoneynow AccuWeather, and this is only two examples of many tbh
@captainboo I have watched many a bad movie for that fine, fine man
I gotta get a new weather app tbh 
@katielikesthis hatch hatch hatch you only YOLO once
I just really care about office supplies okay
@shevraeth @___paotots so did he and his twin end up boning the giant tarantula or whatever it was? I only ever saw previews for that movie.
@shevraeth @___paotots I say go with the movie. You know you'll get to Borgia soon enough right? Or hell, rewatch Bubble Boy. Carpe Diem!
@shevraeth depends: weird like Bubble Boy, or weird like Nightcrawler?
So we just flat out don't like Moffat, right?
Holy shit you guys check out what @afamilyoftrees gave me for Christmas, I'm going apeshit over here! @therealraywise 
Yes Dad Christmas is just the right time to talk about AIDS and Patient Zero no wait no it isn't Jesus fucking Christ what is wrong with you
I've opened 3 presents so far and already I'm Bawling. Brb becoming one of those horrible people who uses the #blessed tag on Instagram.
@merggies I'm going through Monk right now but I might try that one next! I gave up on that show years ago.
@merggies where are you on criminal minds at this point jw
╔╦╗╔╗╔╗╔╗╗╔
║║║╠─║─║─╚╣
╝─╚╚╝╩CHRISTMAS!
<CHRISTMAS TREE><SNOWFLAKE><WRAPPED PRESENT><FATHER CHRISTMAS><PENGUIN><SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW>
Also you know how we look back on those 30s political cartoons mocking Hitler and cringe awkwardly with retrospective knowledge of genocide?
Okay but feeling obligated to shell out cash for what can't possibly be a better-than-mediocre movie doesn't exactly let freedom ring either
This year my real Christmas present is going to be my brother and I transacting my Adderall XR for his Xanax at dinner.
My dad's watching pranks on YouTube god help us all <WEARY FACE>
@captainboo like I'm out to some people but not others who I'd prefer didn't recognize me when I pop up in their "people you may know"
@captainboo my profile pic isn't a photo because Facebook has no security option that prevents anyone from seeing it and, well, you know.
@captainboo lol that's me sorry :x
Like if you have disabilities that prevent you from comfortably using a regular smartphone this one is legit a fucking life changer s t g
I just wanna express the strength of my love for the Samsung Note 4 my dad got me, don't give a shit if you judge me for owning a "phablet".
@merggies @tuckermonteith Doesn't seem too bad! Plus if you ever can't be assed to do it you can just put on a wide-ish headband right?
@punninglinguist it was kind of like this

Who the heck even is Brock O'Hurn, like does he do anything besides wear his hair up in the same way millions of women have been for years?
@the_horla That was supposed to say "pinch", not "punch". Now I just look irrational.
@punninglinguist Even worse, they gave my grandma a small one to take home and we kids LOVED playing with it by blowing on it.
I would punch each and every one of you fuckers super hard for a taqueria chile relleno burrito or some carne asada fries right now.

Can I knit a very nice teeny gauge seed stitch hat in a day and a half? We are about to find out (No, probably, I can't)!
@captainboo Revenge is a dish best served when the tree is sleeping and suspects nothing
You guys what has happened to Mario Lopez's face? Is he wearing makeup? Mascara? Did I miss a well-known thing?
@tuckermonteith @merggies Yeah you can even get them in bulk here! Basically any leftover cow parts, most of them disgusting?
@merggies We had to stop giving those and pig snouts to the dogs because omg they give them gas like woah
Anyway, found a Chapstick that must've rolled under my bed last year or the year before when I was home for Christmas and I'm def using it.
This couch had been in storage for over a year, and he'd probably just been waiting for the chance. And we all laughed because ew, dogs.
One time my parents were moving and the minute the couch got unloaded their dog Dennis pounced on it, dug out a hoof, and went to town on it
Dogs love gross things plus they last longer than rawhide. Long enough to bury them in the yard or, for the lazier dog, under sofa cushions.
We used to give our dogs chew hooves, which I don't know if they do this outside the Midwest but basically they package leftover cow hooves.
In a parallel universe, crotchety parent me is rambling how back in his day there were only a handful of Poptart and Oreo varieties.
@alexiconofstars RT @TheOnion: Biden Gets Grow Light Delivered To White House Under Fake Name 
Like if anyone casually asks my opinion on any product, brand, article of clothing, I immediately just agree it's wonderful, just in case.
Every December I live in terror of accidentally trash talking a gift someone has already gotten for me but not given to me yet.
You know when movie dudes reach into their desk drawer and pull out a bottle of scotch? With me it's a plastic bottle of vodka in my dresser
I love you. I love you I love you a thousand times I love you. Fifty years from now when our friendship was a blip on your radar I love you.
@merggies <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@merggies *quietly crosses "merglian" out on his notebook covers, biting his lip to hold back a sob*
@ginalikesthis @merggies omg please do!
@merggies @ginalikesthis About how much mgg needs me to bone him? I don't doubt it~
@merggies @ginalikesthis Reid could get it tbh I would wreck that man mmhmm
@merggies I think that was probably what it was originally yeah, plus they're not the same race and TV producers and audiences are stupid.
@merggies It always bothered me that you could tell it was like a given they would never ever hook up
@merggies RIGHT?!
@merggies your hair always looks so damn nice and healthy, I wonder why your scalp itches!
@merggies what shampoo/conditioner do you use jw
@punninglinguist Good luck my little pumpkin pie!! ♡♡♡
@RonanFarrow well no one else is going to want them anymore
@shevraeth The Ents are the fucking best tbh
Lol welp on that last retweet @merggies @ginalikesthis
@captainboo tbf, the tree totally started it.
@ginalikesthis Let's move to La Jolla and get a place on the western side of it, closer to the ocean. San Diego is super dog friendly js js
@merggies @ginalikesthis she may forgive you but idk if I can <ANGUISHED FACE>
@merggies Don't you remember? Munch wasn't originally a Law &amp; Order character, he was on Homicide: Life on the Street when he was in X-Files
DJ had too much wine at his company's little Christmas dinner and now he's wandering around La Jolla texting me pictures of Christmas lights
@prettiestflower Also one of the things I don't want to eat while I'm reading
Do I want to try to shower, dress, and get to Costco before the pharmacy closes in an hour &amp; twenty minutes, or say fuck it and go tomorrow?
@TheAVClub You too can sport a hypersexual tattoo version of a legal minor who was raped multiple times and eventually murdered by her dad
Gee maybe android needs another notepad app
@MMFlint sorry, dude RT @TheAVClub: Mark Wahlberg to save Hollywood by making more Transformers movies 
Also I have two phone calls to make if anyone feels like patting me on the head and telling me I'm a very brave boy who may drink at 4pm
@ginalikesthis I'm done pitching a fit but I'm still too angry to go to Whole Foods and try to find an alternative.
my unflavored toothpaste has been discontinued and now chanukah and christmas and new years and my mom's birthday are all ruined RUINED
@wtvoc @merggies @ginalikesthis you really strike me as more of a Helen Mirren or Dame Judi Dench tbh
@wtvoc @merggies @ginalikesthis Like that show Big Love! I'm not Bill Paxton though, I'm more like Bruce Dern.
@wtvoc @ginalikesthis @merggies just how I roll, you knew this when you married me
When you're on so many medications you expect every bottle to have a childproof cap. Soy sauce, booze, everything.
@katielikesthis Could there be a specific person with whom he is friends but you are not that he might be sharing them for?
Man I love ancient alien astronaut theorists
When spam accounts don't even bother actually following you and just favorite or ♡ one of your posts like COME ON
@merggies P.S. guess who just spent way too much time reading about Arsenio Hall and really wants to watch Coming to America now.
@merggies I still remember the entire theme song. It was on like every afternoon along with Tiny Toons!
@merggies And the theme song refs Bill Clinton playing the sax like he did on Arsenio Hall
@katielikesthis But Alaska has TONS of mosquitos, right? Don't they? Am I making that up?
@merggies idk what the undie run is but it sounds like a way less hardcore ripoff of UCSC's first rain naked run t b h
That cheese sandwich was arguably the only good decision I've made today.
Y'all I am so glad I'm not passing on my family's genetic material to another generation
"I'll add many completely unrelated hashtags to my post, that way more people will pay attention to me!" said the high school Instagram user
@TheAVClub Why the FUCK would you think it's okay to post this audio and exploit someone's severe illness for entertainment profit tho
was at oral and how upset you were when he left you for someone else; fucking STOP it. (3/3)
and his wife as her brother and sister-in-law, but it does. It really really does. Like I remember you bragging about how good he (2/3)
I don't even know why exactly it makes me so it immensely uncomfortable that my friend cutesily refers to this guy she used to fuck (1/3)
One down, one to go 
Ever since Kelly Clarkson tweeted the phrase "pitchy strippers" I've been thinking what a great band name The Pitchy Strippers would be.
@merggies @tuckermonteith crossing my fingers for you though, it'd be pretty sweet to have the whole place to yourself yeah?
