So yes after the most horrendous drive to work this morning, naturally, I'm now eating it to reward myself for not crashing
Peanut butter toast is honestly the answer to everything. I don't care how much I talk about it; it deserves all the attention in the world
I'm not sure what I'm more emotional about; getting stuck in a lift, or snagging 2 pairs of tights.
so today I snagged my tights. I went and bought some new ones. I then get stuck in a lift (queue my panic) and then snag the new pair
And no traffic through town and on the A1M was pretty ideal too! #earlybird
I rewarded myself peanut butter on toast and orange juice before going to the gym after getting up at 5.30.Totally worth it <OK HAND SIGN><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

25 minutes of traffic later and I'm 3 miles away from my front door. Hello Tuesday
Diabolical Monday by 11am. Oh what joy this week is going to bring <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Definitely coming down with something when I'm sat in the office declining cake and freezing cold. What is wrong with me today?! <SNOWFLAKE>️<BIRTHDAY CAKE><SHORTCAKE>
Boxes bought, heels repaired, clothes taken back, charity shop stuff taken in and now to go back and continue packing #productiveday
No better way than spending my Saturday starting to box my life up again. Oh wait... <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PENSIVE FACE><PERSEVERING FACE><TIRED FACE>

6am gym club and 8pm gym club are becoming easier and easier. dedication, goals and evident results are the only way to get me motivated <FLEXED BICEPS><OK HAND SIGN><FISTED HAND SIGN>
Ran 5 miles and burnt an impressive 540 calories tonight. Definitely on this marathon training hype <OK HAND SIGN><FLEXED BICEPS><RUNNER> #LondonMarathon
Are there many worse feelings that burning your tongue; AND then biting your cheek when trying to chow it down quickly? Nope didn't think so
Found my iPod &amp; managed to find an old charger too which was a miracle. Massive blast from the past. It hasn't been synced for about 2 years
Anddddd to make today even better; my car has been fixed! And it cost half the price I was originally quoted! Wahoooo #GreatTuesday
such a good session in the gym this morning. hard work pays off <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FLEXED BICEPS><RUNNER><OK HAND SIGN>
Hadn't slept in my bed for 2 and a half weeks before last night; so getting back out of it before 6am today has been testing! Sooo comfy
Cleared out my bag and purse for the first time in god knows how long. Guess what I find? About 60 kirby grips. That's where the buggers go!
So tired I was contemplating just going to bed and totally skipping dinner. Shame my tum is still in Christmas mode and wants feeding! <PIG FACE><PIG FACE>
The lack of interest in unpacking considering I'll be repacking in a couple of weeks to move again is taking over actually unpacking anythin

cheeky spot of shopping on this sunny Sunday. <HIGH-HEELED SHOE><OK HAND SIGN><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️ #nochangethere
the zip just broke on my jeans. whaddafuck. talk about subtle hint #fatty
the prospect of moving house again fills me with nothing but dread. this means I have to clear out my clothes and shoes and box stuff up
I can only advise no one goes for drinks in hatfield. @hannah_miller92 I can only blame your worse half @_JeremyF for this ordeal
just call @hannah_miller92 and I Nigella #Chef 
the grump resulted in some retail therapy and a pamper at the nail salon. #oops <HIGH-HEELED SHOE><DRESS><NAIL POLISH>
not even new shoes can lift this mood
@ZARA_Care they've arrived now but thank you!
feeling a cheeky trip to Hertford for a Starbucks and nail appointment is on the cards this afternoon <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND><NAIL POLISH>
and they are here!!! #greattiming <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

after hours of searching, I have finally found 1 Christmas party dress. <DRESS> #result

@GMValerioxx hahaha I hope they find evidence too because it's very sad if he did kill her :( xx
@GMValerioxx oh I thought he had them on due to the height shots in the door! I did feel sorry for him but ultimately he shot her xx
@GMValerioxx haha nota reason to believe him! he had his legs on when he shot; if he had time to put them on he would see she wasn't in bed!
@GMValerioxx oh god no, I think he's guilty as anything!! it just doesn't all add up! xx

@Steve_Dealtry @CPWTweets I wish I had!! the hassle definitely isn't worth it! and I still don't have a new contract!!!
what an absolute waste of buying myself out my contract for £100!! - in fact I'm pretty sure that's illegal - I paid for nothing @CPWTweets
absolutely appalled at the service I received from @CPWTweets - they not only screwed my contract up, they've also screwed my insurance up
@clementinejess we will sort something my lovely. keep smiling that beautiful smile of yours <FACE THROWING A KISS><BOUQUET>
it upsets me that I lose an hours sleep tonight...
@clementinejess love you too pretty lady. yes please :) Easter weekend we girls should get together for lunch or something!
