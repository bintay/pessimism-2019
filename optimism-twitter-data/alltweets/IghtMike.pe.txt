Trying out the show Dexter. Really different and interesting so far.
@JandarBaba go home.
Sometimes being a Virgo is tiring.
Managed to cut our EDC hotel prices by half with adding an extra room.
People ask me why I don't try to get a girl it's because of this bull.
Looks like it's all yellow lights from here.
@kthwtrmn yeah man lol. It's funny how someone can make you feel that good.
The way you make me feel? It's like driving and hitting all the green lights.
@Chelsuhhh0211 in December visit me at cloud 9 lounge! And... Rave, yeah?

Wanna go get ice cream? @catecallaway
Yeah I'm bored at home. I want a McFlurry lol.
@steelers @DOCnation_7 please don't. I would rather you spamming me free agency then march madness and who our players went to college at

All things happen for a reason. Second interview at Applebee's Friday.
@Maryssa_McDuffy basically that. I was scheduled. I called in. They knew where I was. Then Ron handed me my last paycheck.
@Maryssa_McDuffy they never liked me tbh. Called them out on everything.
@Hero_Of_Ordon Danny would like it. I'll show him later
@Hero_Of_Ordon it's sick just not my style
@Maryssa_McDuffy lol because I called in on Friday and Tony saw me at subway (across town not by village)
Time to start low key DJing.
Always look at everything as a blessing. Blessed for the opportunity but taking my talents to somewhere better now.

Cs get degrees!
@steelers @bkeisel99 much love Keisel.

@Maryam_Nissan yeah
@Maryam_Nissan "Really Mike? I'm disappointed..." Walked out

Does anyone actually care?

@BarackObama @PhillyD
@BarackObama what do you actually do? I'm ashamed to have you as a President. Innocent Christians are being slaughtered in the middle East.
@PhillyD can you talk about what's going on in Syria?
I hate the waiting game.
I need to try different types of styles of clothing.
@fluffyguy favorite place to eat in California? #AskFluffy
Just finished my fourth essay for my sociology class. Four more and I'm done with all essays for the class. Not due till end of April <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@writtenthatway she's a pain in the butt. Thinking her mom was in the cat, someone dies if she goes to the dentist, etc. Hate. Her.
@fernleex oh yeah that's annoying but they weren't together. So you can't blame him. Plus he was drunk.
@fernleex seriously lol. But as a guy you have to see it by both aspects. Girls are very quick to jump to conclusions. Especially w/breakups
Oh and Ross was right not Rachel. They were on a break.
The more I watch Friends again, the more I realize I hate Phoebe. Her horrible singing and guitar playing is annoying.
@PhillyD how do I refer you for dollar shave club? And which blade do you use? Do you recommend any shaving products they have too?

@Tayty_Perry they're taking draft picks probably
Falling asleep in my math class...

2015 is my year of losing weight, going to more raves, and wearing flannels.
@Hero_Of_Ordon 
@MachoCacho17 I just want panthers to take it
@MachoCacho17 the refs were the real MVP of the game tbh
@MachoCacho17 I'm trying to stay away from Steelers photos right now lol. That loss was like a bad break up of the season lol
I need a new lock screen photo... Not sure what though.
Guess I'm starting off the year right already. Fitting into a flannel I couldn't fit into a couple weeks ago.
Rooting for the Broncos now in the AFC and Panthers in the NFC.
Definitely hurting without Bell....
Time to get a @ChelseaFC jersey.
That shot was LEGAL?!
Just became a full time soccer fan.
So these refs can call EVERY possible flag on Pitt and more but not any on Baltimore. BS.
These refs are trying to take EVERY single player on this offense out of the game.
Biggest bull of a game. Horrible refs.
Hating today already.
@da_ali_mastaaa happy birthday! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@TheCaveGuy I'm happy with Martavis Bryant, hopefully Shazier gets healthier..
@TheCaveGuy but you guys got a clutch receiver, top three if not best in the draft this year. And he's only getting better.
@TheCaveGuy the NFL has been so inconsistent with QBs because the DEs, DLs, and LBs are faster so it's harder for the line &amp;OL drafts suck

@steelers @ESPNNFL @Bengals @Seahawks the only natural one, @bkeisel99
@EASPORTS_MUT Cortez Allen, Foster, Forte, and Lacy if Thursdays count.
Took forever but the defense finally looked good.... against the jaguars....
Thirteen hours of sleep last night. I feel recharged lol.
Been sleeping since five.... just woke up.... going back to bed.
Just took a three hour nap because the Lord definitely knows I needed it.
@Hero_Of_Ordon I've heard it lol. Put it on my playlist now. Thanks haha.
The Steelers lost another to the refs.
These refs are horrible.
@EASPORTS_MUT Antonio Brown.
@Rodrigo_Padilla it was good until the last two minutes
Just finished how i met your mother.... I wanna cry now lol.
@Hero_Of_Ordon Ravendor.
@Hero_Of_Ordon spot. On.
Never run away from your fears, you'll never improve that way.
Thanks Kirk Cousins for killing my fantasy #IHateByeWeeks

I'm getting better right? @Hero_Of_Ordon 
After #BeyondWonderland, just been listening to Dada Life on repeat. Love listening to new music.

Got three extra tickets to the Oakland A's game tomorrow, anyone wanna come with? Game starts at 12:30.
@JOLLY6R33NGIANT #FreeSimba
My customers keep talking about the mountain lion and ask me if I'm scared, I just tell them that Simba won't hurt me.
@Maryam_Nissan nope
IT'S GOING DOWN THIS WEEKEND AT BEYOND WONDERLAND!
Anything beautiful is worth getting hurt over.

@JOLLY6R33NGIANT @TheCaveGuy beyond it is.
@TheCaveGuy EXACTLY lol
@TheCaveGuy new album is fantastic though.... plus AFI and thirty seconds to mars play.
I might ditch watching Linkin Park and go to beyond wonderland. Yes or no? Same price but for two days for beyond.
Awkward... I still like youuuuu....
Hella denied her though, saying I definitely don't work at village fresh lol.
Random girl was checked me out at work yesterday.Like she wanted to eat me.She saw me at school today &amp; freaked out saying I work at village
Second quarter, seven minutes left. Eleven flags already. Most penalties ever in one game is 37.... I think it's possible to hit that.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL INTERCEPTION EVER!
The refs love the niners.
Eighteen years ago..... God blessed me with you. Hope you're having fun watching your boyfriends on… 
Had 2 nightmares last night, literally pulled a divergent move though, told myself it's not real in the middle of it &amp; calmed my heart rate.
@Hero_Of_Ordon @MagicAtHogwarts good.. I told you man. Gryffindor.
@cour_bear can you actually go out of town lol. It's at Concord pavilion.
Who's down to go to a Linkin Park concert with me next Friday, floor general admission is roughly $130?
Things I WILL do... cancel @CharterCom for being crap.
Yeah the Steelers lost... but at least I'm not a Niners bandwagonner.
@arbae_ pics or it didn't happen lol jk


Worst call ref
I hate ignorant people.
@BobLabriola @steelers can someone explain lol. Idk all the refs yet
@CharterCom if my internet goes out one more time while I'm trying to play Destiny, I WILL be canceling my internet with you guys.
@JOLLY6R33NGIANT @Luketoasty @X_GonGivItToYa release. I got it preordered.
@JOLLY6R33NGIANT @Luketoasty @X_GonGivItToYa I'm talking about this one lol. Too nerdy.

Rate my professor coming up clutch, Spanish teacher IS hot.
Walking around the first week of school sucking in the gut until you realize no one is here to impress so you just let it all hang out.
@this_be_rems it's just like ignorant people telling me it's been happening for months now tick me off
@this_be_rems no one cared when it has happened to Syria for over two years, and when Iran got involved then Assyrians cared. That's why.
@this_be_rems this has been happening for two years, no Assyrian has cared until Iran got into the mix and no American until the beheading.
I'm not too big into this protesting of what's going on in the middle east for a reason.
I just ran 2.17 mi @ a 14'07'' pace with Nike+.

Ice bucket challenge with a twist: 
@Adrina_A so playing my PlayStation for a workout on my fingers is okay? Cool.
Someone visit me at work, I'm actually stuck in the check stand for a bit.

"@steelers: TOUCHDOWN!  Ben to @AntonioBrown84.  76 yards.  #HereWeGo" #HereWeGo
@catecallaway nothing about that comment was biased at all.

@Hero_Of_Ordon no bridge lol.
@elijahhhhh_ Eww lol
Be honest, how does that look? @Hero_Of_Ordon no filter btw 
Call me odd, because right now I can't even...
@Tyker_ @Kohls I tried opening a box of shoes a couple days ago, when I opened it, someone's old shoes were in it. #Swapped
That killed my vibe.
@Hero_Of_Ordon you showed me last time. I liked it
@TheCaveGuy go home Marco.
@Hero_Of_Ordon I didn't like it...
Alright. It's on. Losing twenty pounds to finally have the confidence to ask you out on a proper date.
Got a blue card today during my indoor soccer game, whatever that means...
Thanks dad for taking my car to go to the casino with my indoor gear in it. Don't worry, I'll do great without them.
43 hours next week? Yeah, I'm cool with that.

@Anaa_LOV3 @TrevorGray17 get a pimp cane please.
@Sabrina_Yonan calm down Edward

@Sabrina_Yonan Eww. That awkward age.
@Sabrina_Yonan she didn't even turn eighteen yet. That goober.
@Sabrina_Yonan dang. Miss her already...
@Sabrina_Yonan nooooooo, don't do it, she wasn't ready!

@APargaO_o when you wanna do that then lol.
@APargaO_o my car said 111 degrees lol.
@APargaO_o sure... You have the comb over but... styling it like this is better haha. 
I may not be the best looking, smartest, or have the body but I can say that I will give my all to you and be your knight and shining armor.
@shari_notsorry @Hero_Of_Ordon @kristinad517 my house, 5 pm Tuesday, Dr who 50th movie and Christmas special.
@APargaO_o leaving my house in a minute
@kristinad517 @Hero_Of_Ordon @Maryam_Nissan I'm downloading both as we speak. I'll let you know when we can have a movie night, all of us
@kristinad517 @Hero_Of_Ordon @Maryam_Nissan 50th anniversary and Christmas special lol
@elijahhhhh_ I'm taking you one day. You'll like it.
@elijahhhhh_ they're so cheap lol. Like kohls on steroids.
@elijahhhhh_ someone must shop at American eagle.
@Hero_Of_Ordon that's why I said it lol
@Hero_Of_Ordon because she's dauntless now? Duh.
@Hero_Of_Ordon not anymore..
@Hero_Of_Ordon eh... they have somethings going on
@TheCaveGuy @Luketoasty he did? That's cute.
@Luketoasty @TheCaveGuy but it helps out our case on both
@TheCaveGuy @Luketoasty yup. Since you're not comparing school size or divisions at that point. Just skill of the athletes in the schools
@Luketoasty @TheCaveGuy plus, if you compare individuals in track, we would do better, not just as a team.
@TheCaveGuy @Luketoasty eh, I feel like the coaches over their are either the product of Denair or can't get a real job at Turlock lol
@Luketoasty @TheCaveGuy what he's trying to say is, the bigger the school, the better the athletes. That's why THS/PHS has greatness
@Hero_Of_Ordon I think I might be Gryffindor then...
Cutting back on eating has definitely helped me.
My name is Mike Nissan and I like country music.
@masonrmorales in due time! Lol.
I want to be with a girl where people say "look how cute they are!" or "how does a guy like him get a girl like that?" I need a princess....
I still haven't seen the purge, the first one...
Been knocked out cold for 3 1/2 hours sleeping. And I slept ten hours last night. My body definitely needed this.
I feel like I'm playing a game that I'm destined to lose.
Running after you is like chasing the clouds.
I hope so. 
Not many people influence me on changing my ways but it looks like you've started improving me already....
@TheCaveGuy @JOLLY6R33NGIANT @elijahhhhh_ or two
@TheCaveGuy @JOLLY6R33NGIANT @elijahhhhh_ this was three years ago
@JOLLY6R33NGIANT @elijahhhhh_ @TheCaveGuy oh and suck it Kyle 
@JOLLY6R33NGIANT @elijahhhhh_ @TheCaveGuy because you got a truck...
@elijahhhhh_ @TheCaveGuy more like Marco is such a model. The more accurate statement.
@catecallaway bye then :O
If @elijahhhhh_ says she can park, don't believe her. @TheCaveGuy is my witness. 
@catecallaway miss youuuuu
Today sucks already. You know it's bad when you actually look forward to work.

@Hero_Of_Ordon down lol
@kristinad517 still recovering from the long trip lol.
Best ten hours of sleep of my life :D
@Maryam_Nissan No.
I hate people today.
@Maryam_Nissan I'm coming back tomorrow!

I am the produce clerk. This is me.
Looks like a lot of thinking today.
@lexisvila54 alright, I'll be working again starting Thursday
@lexisvila54 what's wrong?
What a buzzkill....
@Poetic_KT haha yeah right.
Someone text me, 2092779798, road tripping to San Diego for another four hours.
Because I like writing poems.... Oh well. 
Finished Mixology already lol. Like two days. Only a season long, unfortunately ABC didn't want to make a new season.
"This show is stupid..... make it louder."
Freaking Bruce. #Mixology

Greatest thing a ginger has said. Thank you Mixology.

Found a good show on Netflix. Mixology. Nice.
That robbed my day.
Job interview soon, wish me luck!
Dear future girlfriend,
Come to my house right now because I'm not feeling too good.
With love,
Your future boyfriend.
"@TheNicoleMacedo: # not cool @Hero_Of_Ordon @IghtMike

@miaamyrellaa_ because I haven't tweeted until now, duh lol
Guys, step it up, girls remember everything. Especially our generation.
@Hero_Of_Ordon half way lol
@Hero_Of_Ordon boring lol
@Maryam_Nissan I can actually go to church if I get this job.
@Maryam_Nissan I'm happy lol
@Maryam_Nissan lol what? No. Interview on Sunday.
That phone call just made my night.
I need a new real best friend. Someone who's actually here for me.
@JacklynKuharski eh. Not my cup of tea.
@JacklynKuharski my birthdays have sucked so Idc. Do you.
@JacklynKuharski people in general. Birthdays aren't a big deal to me unless it's 18 or 21 really.
I dislike it when people make a huge deal about their birthday, relax, you're not the only one who has one that day.
@staceyysantos Argentina win
You know Germany is taking it now.
Screw Argentina.
@fufu_lameshit it's all guessing... It's tough
@fufu_lameshit you know how hard it is blocking a PK?
Argentina's goalie is a tool.
The nail bitter!
@danielson209 I just don't like this ref. Seems sketchy to me man. Plus, hate Messi.
@danielson209 have you been watching the same game as me? They haven't been calling as much fouls on Argentina as they should be.
I think if the game had a different ref, it would be over, 1-0, Netherlands.
FIFA soccer players have been flopping more than LeBron James during the finals.
Bad call ref, bad call.
The list of inconsiderate people I know has been getting longer and longer.
I'm just tired of getting screwed over.
Is their a cable company that's just sports, no stupid tv shows...
Today has been a buzzkill.
Netherlands are looking better than Argentina right now, but Argentina's goalkeeper is keeping them in it.
Furious at the world right now
@Hero_Of_Ordon lol I'll pass
@Hero_Of_Ordon too late baka. Once you get me going, it's on. Spoilers, Tris becomes Dauntless.
@Hero_Of_Ordon maybe lol
@Hero_Of_Ordon two days ago? Or three...Idk
@Hero_Of_Ordon co-worker has dibs. He's finishing Divergent right now.
I have three cuts on one hand, darn produce knife.
Already 100 pages in Allegiant.
Finished Insurgent.
Three hour nap. This is why I think I'm always exhausted, work is killing my sleep schedule.
My backs killing me.... the one time I wish I had a girlfriend, to massage it.
This movie is ticking me off. Totally not like the book.... biggest buzzkill....
@sofia_yonan respect, respect lol
@sofia_yonan I'm a Dauntless lol. If you say so stiff.
Watching Divergent right now, the Abnegation look so boring. Haha.

Netherlands! With the nail biter!
@danielson209 but they've been doing dirty hits all game...
Big Show on Psych! Nice lol.
Poor Neymar.
Almost done with psych on Netflix. Anyone suggestions on any shows?
Never give up on something that you can't go a day without thinking about.
@danielson209 go to the sports center app, go to fifa world cup, then news. You'll see his hit. It was a knee to the back. No yellow?
@danielson209 I heard. How bad was it, I missed it?
@danielson209 Germany isn't good against the counter lol. And we are screwed... IF we win, we are taking it. But that's an if.
@danielson209 they aren't good against the counter, if Neymar is healthy, we might have a chance
@danielson209 more like I'm a Brazil fan complaining he didn't deserve the second one. But I'm biased on that one haha
Thiago Silva suspended vs Germany? Rigged....
@catecallaway @swagwizardxx @TheCaveGuy @JOLLY6R33NGIANT @tboots09 it's with family...

Just watch out, gonna look sexy... Maybe haha. Gonna try to look my best before I hit 21.
@Rodrigo_Padilla I just finished it. I'm dead, not as crazy as insanity but I sweated as much.

@TheCaveGuy @Hero_Of_Ordon Idk why this is so great lol
@lexisvila54 dang it Casey lol.
@lexisvila54 technically produce manager now brah ;)

Get out of America.
Love, 
Someone who speaks it.

If my horoscope says "up too early" then it's 100% accurate this whole summer.
I'm thinking about shaving my head and rocking the beard. Input?
I hate this place.
Why is working before noon a thing?
@Maryam_Nissan you're not useful tonight.

@Maryam_Nissan go home.
I think I'm broken.
Screw everything.
Screw relationships.
Screw annoying little kids.
Screw tonight. Goodnight.
My dad acts like a five year old all the time. It's sad really.
Be careful what you shoot for because you might hit what you aim for.
@Hero_Of_Ordon search who's line is it anyways Dr who. You're welcome
@Hero_Of_Ordon lol no joke though, my friend was like omg it looks so professional! I was not bad, and seeing it out of the sub, like wow ha

Dumb game lol

@cour_bear lol it's a glitch, if I save the photo I took, it says screenshot
You did good San Antonio
Beautiful PK.
B.s. call by the ref, he shouldn't have got a yellow card. Pogba was the victim. It's because he's black, racist ref lol
The most annoying sound of this whole game has been the ivory coast fans shaking their stupid things. Go home.
Two headers in two minutes. Woah.
Dr who season seven is now on Netflix! Epic.
That awkward moment when you check a girl out from behind think to yourself you've seen those legs before, and find out it's your friend.
The guy should have gotten a yellow card, good penalty shot though.
To all the non soccer fans, the American football score is 35-7, with Spain losing.
@N_Odisho95 @mr_sandman209 he legally did
Spain is playing like an MLS team haha.
Now it's officially rape.
Time to submit the highlights of this game to the police, I think the Holland team will get trailed for murdering the Spain team.
RVP is raping Spain.
@BDxArctic eh, I'm upset Donovan isn't on the roster
@BDxArctic not a big Spain fan, just a Torres fan lol.
@BDxArctic my bad haha, that was so bad.
@BDxArctic not really lol.
Kinda glad Spain is crumbling.
@Hero_Of_Ordon another goal!
Forever single.
Torres!
That annoying moment when you realize that Diego Costa will sign with Chelsea.... kinda annoyed with that as a Chelsea fan.
Just wow. Another classy goal.
Hella crazy goal! Van Persie!

Someone convince me on a tv show on Netflix.
It's never the problem of me making the effort. It's always about not being recognized for the things I do for her.
How I can guarantee I won't have distractions the rest of the month? Finishing the last two episodes of Grey's on Netflix.
@ModestoToyota yes! It's not a push to start is it?
I really like this episode of Grey's. Actually showing everyone what Syrian doctors go through and how Syria is surviving.
@ModestoToyota I have a couple of questions. Do you guys still have the 14 Nissan versa 1.6s?
DONE! Kay, bye haha.
@Hero_Of_Ordon Haha, I'm cool. I'm used to being up this late so this isn't new to me.
