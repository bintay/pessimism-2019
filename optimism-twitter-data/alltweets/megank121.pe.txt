Go to prom, and try not to look like a Dorito.
@khwhitwell oh it's not? Then pls explain why you're upset again?
@neasha_adelle @khwhitwell getting upset at someone's feelings, right or wrong, is rude.
I'm pretty sure someone would know exactly why theyre upset and who they're upset at. If you ask what's wrong, don't get upset at the answer

How bout you "get to know somebody" before you call them ugly. Lol, including myself &amp; the Dorito girl.

Oh im sorry, I can't be judgmental. But you can? Lol I hate CA.
