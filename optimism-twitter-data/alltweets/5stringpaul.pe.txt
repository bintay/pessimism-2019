@dejavousagain @LabourList hopfully...
@chrisbates3 agree, sadly, but would prefer a non socialist Blairite PM to Cam/Boris for next 10yrs.
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings Sounds fair,but it's all academic. With40+ seats for Cam in boundry revision, no chance of PR for next 5yrs.
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings sorry, my 'tit' went missing ;-)
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings just as an idea - what about FPTP in constituencies 3x the size at present, and 1st/2nd/3rd go to HOC?
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings I would accept some form of PR that avoids Party Lists and maintains a link with constuencies.
@chrisbates3 but all but a handful of MPs would fail that test.
@LabourList The choice for Lab is simple-would you rather have 5/10 years of Cam/Boris or ,even though I hate to say it,a Blairite PM?
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings 
Cameron only got 37% of the vote 63% voted against. It is ligitimate 'cos 'no' voters are deemed to agree maj
@chrisbates3 because all democratic processes in any situation will only work if those that don't vote are deemed to support the Majority.
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings my point being that TU ballot reform will require 50% eligible to vote for action. Non voters counted against.
@chrisbates3 @doyoudoanywings yup Decimal place error. But doesn't distract from my point.
Also re TU ballots ~30% didn't vote at all
@changepatriot well, the 64% didn't vote did they?
@maxelltrotter Your last line says it all...
@maxelltrotter Me Too, I would hate it and hold my nose,but sadly only way back..
A simple question facing Labour - Would you rather have a Blairite PM or another 10 yrs of Cameron/Boris government?

@wernethlow1 80% of people recieving welfare are in work. 
Your taxes are needed to pay private landlords £9bn in housing benefit.
#bbcaq FPTP is obviously unfair, but maintains the link to local MP. How about constituences 3X the size straight voting 1st/2nd/3rd to HOC
@wernethlow1 That's the 1% that have 90% of the wealth. So us 99% that have 10% of the wealth pay 80% of the taxes.

@purpleline i know you think that, but Lab should have challenged and not letCon pin it solidly in the public's mind.
Banks never mentioned
@purpleline Lab allowed the 'It was all Labours fault' to go unchallenged for 5 yrs.
@purpleline not bad luck, incompentence in campaign
@purpleline Congrats ..we'll be back
@wernethlow1 Looks like it, Well done
@annejoynes @Redpeter99 Didn't need them,Mil and Balls could have but for some reason didn't.
A failed political strategy they deserved loss
#bbcnews So right the worst ever, hopeless.
Trtying to be too clever, forgetting we just want the results. 
@purpleline enjoy your sleep?
@In_A_Flap how far left to they have to  be for it to be classed as 'envy' -- that's  just a right wing cliche
@In_A_Flap New Labour -yup, must agree. Why I never voted for Blair
#bbcnews This is hopeless the worst election coverage I have ever seen in 50yrs of watching elections.
No idea of results in England
@purpleline @itvnews night ;-)
@In_A_Flap @purpleline so happy to pass democracy to those with the deepest pockets?
@purpleline @In_A_Flap why don't you do what you really want and ban them altogether.
Revive the Combination Act of 17th century
@purpleline @itvnews will give it a go
@purpleline @itvnews lots of tweets claiming results, don't know if true.
@purpleline @itvnews not on my telly yet (Sky-given up on BBC's crap covereage)
@In_A_Flap ;-)
@In_A_Flap what do you expect :-)
@purpleline Gall stones, ulcers. &amp; gout - have you any bits in full working order...?
@In_A_Flap yes, my tweet said 'majority'
@In_A_Flap OK, but it's 23yrs since 1992
@McnabbTeddy I was a bit more generous I predicted 18months thought the RW (swivel-eyed loons) would bring it down
@In_A_Flap 18 ?
@purpleline you have gall stones and ulcers in a very strange place - could be gout of the head though. ;-)
@purpleline you realise I now have that in writing and have fav'd it. ;-)
@McnabbTeddy yes,clearly, but not the result Cam would have wanted and with the loss of LDs is in a difficult position to lead a Gov
@purpleline yes, not denying the obvious, just pointing out a fact. You I recall predicted a clear majority.
@McnabbTeddy yes, but it's not an unreasonable prediction
@McnabbTeddy That's true, but with a tighter majority and rebels behind him, Cam will have a tough time
#bbcnews For Gods sake BBC have you not rehearsed this appaling coverage? Missed declarations, graphics slow..4mins and still no graphic.
No Tory majority for 28 yrs
@In_A_Flap United more in 'hate' of the Tories than each other. Exciting times in (used to be) smoke filled rooms next week
@In_A_Flap difficult to govern with such a tight majority,specially with rebellious RW 'bastards' on benches behind him?
If lots of UKIP support in Chelms, then presumably taking from Tories. Wonder if exit poll would catch that?
ps exit shows Coalition gone.
@purpleline my gut feeling was a Tory lead, but not so sure now, polls seem not to have taken UKIP swings into account.UKIP swing in South?

@purpleline @greatlakesforex ..been to the food bank I see
@wernethlow1 Lab didn't say'all' are 0hrs
To say it's a myth that most of 1.8m are 0hrs-cos it's only 2.3% ignors that it's 30% of all new
@wernethlow1 you were going to prove that Young was right re. 0 hrs, you have not rebutted my case. Where is your argument?
@wernethlow1 where's the case for dis-proving my argument re. 0 hrs?
@wernethlow1 why have you sent me a link to a page that dosen't mention 0hrs?
@wernethlow1 correction - 600000 0Hrs since 2010
@wernethlow1 Of the 1.8m 'new jobs' since 2010, 695000 are 0 hrs. That's ~33%.
In 2009 0hrs were 0.5% of all jobs, in 2014 it was 2.5% ie 5X
@wernethlow1 seen it before and he's wrong on 0 hrs
@GeorginaBloor Well, to be thruthful, most of the garden is Green and the house is Red, so you'd better start worrying...

@purpleline @paulallchorne you missed a great series. Watching 'Ballot Monkeys'? The best election comedy ever. Ridicules all parties.

@In_A_Flap only by threatening to vote with and support the tories. They may do, but I very much doubt it

@purpleline 'no idea' so you didn't care.Typical of the city types not to care about anyone else, sound like the Bullingdon Club approach.
@purpleline Ah.The city yobs approach then.What did the audience of hard working folk having bought seats think of you spoiling their event?
@purpleline so did you challenge him with incisive wit and  intellectual precision or just barrack him like a buch of city yobs?
@purpleline so he did make you laugh then...
@purpleline didn't do him any harm though, obviously
@In_A_Flap nope not a requirement, a challenge not to
@paulallchorne @purpleline so what comics are funny for you?

@purpleline @paulallchorne  sometimes. My point wasn't to criticise your tweet, just trying to make a joke about your joke making delivery.
@purpleline @paulallchorne probably shows why there are very few right wing comendians that people think are funny.. ;-)
@Sheanderthal  Irrelevent to my original tweet, which was against the claim that Lab policies are controlled by UNITE.
@Sheanderthal @ReebarrRees exactly my point. Lab not under the thumb of UNITE 'cos Lab wont give a referendom on EU which UNITE want
@Sheanderthal @ReebarrRees Yes, the are now (I was wrong on that), but now support an EU referendom. So Lab are still not under UNITE thumb

@EmlynHywel Trouble is I haven't heard of a system that permits local representation ie 1st, 2nd etc in a national parliament
@EmlynHywel I would support a form of PR that doesn't involve 'member lists'

UKIP - 11% (+8)
GRN - 5% (+4)
LDEM - 5% (-1…
@petervhale ..and it's not just working people that get the increase in personal tax allowances, the millionairs get it too
If we once again get a 'tie' in GE this will inevitably lead to some form of PR to make it fair. Just can't think of a 'fair' way for it.

@purpleline @wernethlow1 @toadmeister @GeorginaBloor The 1.8 mil in my tweets are the 1.8mil new jobs the Coalition claim created since 2010
@purpleline @wernethlow1 @toadmeister @GeorginaBloor not recent, in 2013 survey showed about 60% satisfied. But No of 0hrs, much higher now
@wernethlow1 @purpleline @toadmeister @GeorginaBloor 
Why have you gone to some obscure table when the 'main points' page Feb15 states 31.05
@wernethlow1 @purpleline @toadmeister @spectator ONS April 2015 quotes 31.05 people in work
@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @GeorginaBloor
Not my point, some will wan't them. Just putting the 2.3% into context.
@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator it is calculated from the total workforce of 29m in 2010  &amp; 31 mil in 2015
ONS figures
@DaveHill best idea-Hamburg
Only allowed 30mins in one spot, and no amplification allowed. City official patrols the streets and enforces it
@paulallchorne It's 1.8 mil extra jobs that Tories claim to have achieved since 2010, not 0 Hrs contracts.
@DaveHill although have been a busker, you can always walk away, but being trapped in a train you can't. - must agree with you..
@GeorginaBloor @purpleline 
OK - 2010= 0.6% 0hrs
2015 = 2.3% That's 4X

@toadmeister @wernethlow1 @purpleline @spectator @FullFact Well, Toby The D.Mail has had a shot at it (0.6% in2010)

@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator Where are my numbers wrong?
@wernethlow1 @purpleline @toadmeister @spectator so where am I wrong?
If it's not 33% increase since 2009 what is it?
@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator I've never disputed the 2.3% or that some like them.Just showing that of 1.8m 33% are 0hrs
@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator not on the point I'm making. Of the much vaunted increase in jobs of 1.8m 33% are 0 hrs
@purpleline @toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator explain Peter
@toadmeister @wernethlow1 @spectator yes, but it was 100k in 2009 (Actually now 695k) so of 1.8mil new jobs since 2009, 33% are 0 Hrs
@wernethlow1 @toadmeister @spectator He claims 2.3% of workforce are 0 hrs-He's may right, but of the1.8m 'new' jobs 600k are 0hrs (100k-09)
@toadmeister @spectator are you going to tell them that of the 1.8m 'new'jobs 600,000 ie 33% are 0 hrs?

Only 2.3% of jobs are 0hrs. Actually,since June 2010 0hrs have risen by 600,000.So % of 0hr jobs of the 1.8mil under tories,is 33%. not 2.3%

@paulallchorne which they are not prepared to do

@purpleline @jon_swindon  Fallon clearly a pot calling a kettle black.
@GregHands I thought you were going to limit rail fare increases to Inflation, which is not a freeze

#bbcqt Wrong @timothy_stanley ISAs are not tax avoiding, the chancellor wants us to have them.Avoiders dodge the taxes he wants them to pay.

#bbctw Is it not the case that the heartland of liberty and enterprise the US taxes it's inhabitants on all their world wide earnings?

@itiddly when the tories shut up, I'm fine thanks mate, hope you're the same.
@itiddly just reading out the tory crib sheet as instructed...
@Ferruzzicati no it isn't, the rules they avoid are there because the chancellor wants them to pay them.What other reason are they for?

@purpleline Nope, it was always there, but he saw fit to deny us the wit to find it.
@purpleline won't be Lab that blocks it, it will be the stockbroker belt NIMBY's.

@CallingEngland @rmlabour a fair point of view, but most, if not all, polls show the majority wan't to stay in.

@purpleline @guardian_clark most unfair, that all you rich blokes that can buy most things don't seem to be able to buy the poll results
@purpleline You want the freedom to bear arms they'll be the first to get them. You'll have to dig up the AK47s you buried under the patio
@purpleline  awww .-)
@purpleline you'll have to train the hounds to detect lefties... and Anti hunt lefties are skilled at evading
@purpleline cull - you mean turn your local hunt on all foreigners and lefties?
@purpleline yup,coal man had a horse &amp; cart as did the baker and milkman. Dad's used to stand by gate with pail hoping the horse would poop
@purpleline  yes, used to have a long stick with a rubber thingy on the end and seemed to stick it the ground and listen.
@purpleline look out for a man at the door with a waterboard, I'm looking out for man with a suitcase ful of cash....
@purpleline didn't someone coin  a phrase 'swivel eyed loons' ;-)

@jackrussellcb ?
@jackrussellcb He stood up to it perfectly well.I'm challanging who selected that Q, out of all the Q's they could have asked a potential PM
@oldlefty47 no chance doesn't suit their narrative.
@jackrussellcb nope, But SKY were last time and selected the Bro Q for EM - that's the point of my tweet.
#leadersdebate Who selects the questions??
Like last time - Ask ED about his brother but not ask Cameron about Coulson &amp; Rock?

@paulallchorne nope, all those without jobs should be employed on NMW by the state. Rather than cobbled pay schemes as cheap lab for bus.
@paulallchorne can't chose dole, accept p/t,0hrs/pt/w fare etc or be sanctioned.
@paulallchorne yes, Nobody has actually seen the back of the moon, but I believe it to be there, do you? (or was it a deep qu that I missed)
@paulallchorne not attacking job numbers, am attacking their claim that u/e are getting all the high paid jobs.
Will #Cameron and #Clegg apologise for lying about the part #Labour played in economic crash?

@paulallchorne what has that got to do with Tory false claims on u/e.?
@paulallchorne nope, It's the Tories claiming u/e are filling these high paid jobs they claim to have created.
Nor is it immigrants.
@paulallchorne Nope,it's you lot that want it both ways,Claim high paid jobs are filled by the u/e. When in fact P/time/Ohrs/WFare/Sanctions
#c4news So most 'new jobs' are high paid jobs, great news for redundant Building Labourers from Hull getting IT jobs in Cambridge -huh?
@SNP_ForScotland @LabourLeft They're well heeled OK, but unlike most well heeled Tories, are voting against their own self interest.
@michelerhanson @magapanthus I want them to fight back with gusto.The Tories will cover the country with Tax Bombshell posters.£80m to spend
@michelerhanson @magapanthus @UKLabour agree, just illustrating what Lab could claim using the tory methodology -if they had the wit.
@Cilvrnum true loyal Tory patriots then?....
#bbcdp If Tories can claim £3K Lab tax, then Lab can claim all those (13K) Millionaires will get £200K tax reward for their donations to Cam
#bbcdp  If Tories can claim £3000 Lab tax, then Lab can claim all those (13000) Millionaires will get £200,000 tax reward.
If Tories can claim £3000 Lab tax, then Lab can claim all those (13000) Millionaires will get £200,000 tax bribe.

#Clarkson So a non lefty BBC would have renewed his contract &amp; sacked Tymon(a lefty Irish C**t ) for attacking Clarkson's fist with his lip?
@purpleline That's utter bollox Peter - look at the graph on the link. Prolonged high unemployment.11.9 %,10.2%. You can't credibly deny it
@purpleline so are you claiming that the Tories have a better record (ie, lower) unemplyment that Lab? or just using a quirky PR spin point?
@purpleline which fact are you refering to, the 1 that shows a small rise after the banking crisis, or the massive prolonged hike in 79/97
@purpleline look at the graph and tell me how you can cliam that Tories have a better record on unemployment
@purpleline Hang on. Was 5.2% in 79 and 7.5% in 97. how is that lower?

@Ironwand @purpleline @andreassoridis so it was an existing policy, not a QUOTE from Harman at all.
THAT is THE factual score.

@purpleline Margaret &amp; the Tories covered it up,so she must be a lefty too. Looks like you are the one true Tory left in the Party...
@purpleline  While you're tracing the quote.

@purpleline @andreassoridis @Ironwand That's not a source, anyone could make up anything and claim it is a quote - find the reference

@purpleline ..but not as rich as FX Traders I bet....
@purpleline So Tories haven't won an election in 23yrs because of the Mail,Express,Sun,Telegraph etc just printed Labour spin - really?
@purpleline The Brirish electorate didn't think so gave Lab a massive majority, and health and education were not good enough for you.
8% to 15% (1979)
15% to 17.5% (1991)
17.5% to 20% (2010)
It's all very well for the Tories to rant about Salmond &amp; Lab, who cost them the 40 Scots Tory MPs in 70/80s that would have stopped it?

Oh wait, it's Ravioli.
@purpleline Lab got the 13yrs because 18yrs of Thatcher &amp; Major Fkd both NHS &amp; Education. Also lost 20+Scottish MPs so gave birth to SNP.
@purpleline @Channel4News hosp infection caused by cowboy cleaning Co's.
@purpleline @Channel4News So how would Major have financed repairing appalling state of Hospitals &amp; Schools that cost him 97 election - Tax?
@purpleline @Channel4News the only thing that stopped Major expanding it was that the electorate dumped him.

@GeorginaBloor nope, doesn't use the word like or many.
@GeorginaBloor Pobably a clone of Esther McVey he keeps to threaten his kids with when they're naughty.Well, those he hasn't left in the pub
@GeorginaBloor not the point, Started leader contest (the whole of the press) and mentioned 3 names.
Crosby will be livid...
@GeorginaBloor The only support for 'honest answer'Cameron I've seen so far are Grove &amp; Fallon, who are Crosby's cock-up rescue squad. (&amp; u)
@GeorginaBloor So rejecting as talentless the rest of his cabinet is civilised, whereas beating your brother in an election,is somehow not?

@purpleline So sad when the young go before their time.Ste was 46.
You have my sympathy Peter, can only hope that it will be a quiet ending.
@purpleline have also done same for my father &amp; Geo's father 2hrs+ of them talking about their lives, family &amp; the war etc..
@purpleline were you visiting your neice in the Hospice? Strongly urge you trace the recordings you mentioned- u will treasure them if....

@purpleline Hi Peter, are you watching Trevor Phillips on C4?
If not you should be or watch it on catch up.Think you will be surprised
@Cilvrnum Apparantly you're suggesting someone on £17k a yr suffers the same as anoth on £100k when their energy bills rise £20/m.
Really?
#Budget2015  What makes any one think that Osborne's new crystal ball is any less dysfunctional than his old one?
#Budget2015 A cut in beer duty to help them with what they like.A whole 0.33% off a pint of beer.
Just rejoice at that news....
@leftferret @tomhbatty yup, shocking sacrifice, not bloody fair...
@tomhbatty   or more likely, just cut their hours and let us pay by increasing tax threshold.
@KathyShaw1 not really. If you're that wealthy you won't notice it. Just something to attack Lab that will appeal to their rich supporters.

@paulallchorne yup, 3 Day week (74) &amp; Dacaying schools &amp; hospitals 1997 public gave Lab massive majority.
@paulallchorne  ..as did the last 2 tory Governments, and are you suggesting the OBR is a hotbed of radical socialism? Chote is a Lib Dem..
@paullewismoney does that mean every vending/parking meter etc will have to be modified?
@paulallchorne @purpleline nope, Cam &amp; media ridicule anything they say, have to maintain the Chaos election mantra.
It is starting to look like the pundits on my timeline are beginning to dis-assemble Osbo's budget predictions.
Another omnishambles?
@purpleline @ITVJoel @itvnews Cam could allow it,so must conclude he is scared of OBR confirmation of Lab plans &amp; Chaos mantra collapses.
@purpleline @ITVJoel @itvnews So we pay for OBR but Lab not allowed by Cameron to use it's expertise(if doubtful).It's not law,in Cams gift.
Taking the low paid out of tax also means employers don't have to increase wages...(the real reason?)
@purpleline @ITVJoel @itvnews if that's so why is Cam not prepared to allow them to cost Lab's proposals?
"Runnin' N***** Target"
We have a race problem, America.

#ThirskandMalton  Don't believe a word of why Anne Mcintosh is not standing as Ind. Tory whips will have got out their black books...
@purpleline probably for the same reason thet the D.Mail hasn't reported Portillo's attack on Vine

@purpleline He can't be everywhere so you will have to put large posters of him in all cities, towns and villages.
@purpleline  Thatcher saw to the first.So workers will have to chose between a P45 or an AK47?
You will need perks for you supporters-what?

@purpleline No they don't.If Len did,then Tory Union Laws would be amended and Lab would be supporting an EU referendum. Alex fighting Lab
@purpleline Ed supports Trident - you really must stop believing your own Party's propoganda.It's an election tactic to frighten the horses
@purpleline Ed doesn't want to break up the UK either,wheras I recall you were all in favour of it.
@purpleline no more than I approve of Clegg/Unionists running Cameron who failed to get a majority..
@purpleline nope, You attack your opponants weak  points Ed did and won. Cam is obsessed with opposing Scots democratic choice.
@purpleline Cam didn't like it - Win for Ed
@purpleline He could wipe the floor with Cameron and you would still insist Cameron has won..
The knives are already out for Cam post GE.
@purpleline Ed didn't 'knife his brother' both stood for an election, Ed won.Stabbing in the back is what Thatcher's Tory Cabinet did to her
Idiotic lefties driving you mad or swivel eyed loons on the right making you angry?

@Karl_Frampton If the BBC wan't someone to interview Cameron, how about offering Ed Miliband?
@itiddly ..and Cameron wasn't there....
@purpleline ..Cameron is, of course, the other end....
@purpleline should have gone to the science museum, they have buttons to press there...
Since the Tories love hunting with dogs, and hate the poor/disabled and unemployed, will they complete the circle and  set the dogs on them?
@purpleline are you actually there?
@purpleline @BBCPolitics while you are there, pop into the dinosaur section where they keep the Tories, UKIP fossiles are over on the right.
@purpleline @BBCPolitics makes a change for you to use genetically accurate expleteive.. rather then your usual...;-)

@In_A_Flap @LabourList we seem to be at cross purposes Jock. To any comment re Mil &amp; Chair I would reply with the video I sent you.
@RichardJMurphy 'cos he can't understand that you've not been brainwashed by the combined efforts of 'his' media like the rest of UK.
@In_A_Flap @LabourList and my response would be the same..
@StarSparkle_UK @Gedk @KrustyAllslopp @Margaret_Curran yes, but a very very good one....
@StarSparkle_UK @Gedk @KrustyAllslopp @Margaret_Curran ..ah, but it is now a modernised Dulux red - Blairs Blush

@Samson1176 @TheHappySlapper @ChriswMP @mr_g_biscuits @GABaines @PompeyGoat well, that's what Theresa May said....
@Samson1176 @TheHappySlapper @ChriswMP @mr_g_biscuits @GABaines @PompeyGoat Tories want more poverty so can move the proceeds to the rich.

Osborne could have restored the tax relief on pension dividends -but didn't
@GABaines @ChriswMP @PompeyGoat  Thatcher changed pension link from RPI to CPI, costing pensioners billions.

John Major intervention - simple 
Ed tell him to 'F'-off none of his business.
@MrMalky @StarSparkle_UK If SNP can find a way to stand its L/W policies in Eng seperate from Independance, it would make New Lab redundant.
@MrMalky @StarSparkle_UK Hope SNP get enough seats to pressure Lab to get rid of the Blairite infestation and back to it's roots.
