*hach* sometimes I forget what amazing human beings y'all are!!! D'AWWWW!!!!!
@TheTrueCalliope ui, thank youuuuuuuuu!!!
@TheTrueCalliope hmm, sounds good!
MY FEET ARE KILLING ME!! Anyone want them??? Cause I don't!!! OWWWWW!!!
@TheTrueCalliope and I'll be a 20 year old with endless energy!! *giggles* or in front of my fav celebrity and I'm 12 again!
@TheTrueCalliope exactly! one is as old as one feels... right now about 60 because my feet and my back are kiling me. Put me into London tho
@TheTrueCalliope coming back to bite you in the ass every noe and then!! *hehe*
@TheTrueCalliope I'Ve tried that but apparently my face didn't work for them. Totally cool with that! And yes, YOUNG AT HEART!! Even if it's
@TheTrueCalliope HUSH!!! I#m still trying to tell myself I have a few more years left before I have to call mysefl old...
@TheTrueCalliope we're REALLY getting old, are we?!
@TheTrueCalliope I sooo would do it if there werent any other way. But I'm def getting to old for that!
@TheTrueCalliope eh, much better than going straight back to work from the airport like I have done in the past! NEVER AGAIN! Although...
@TheTrueCalliope that why I ALWAYS try to take a few days off after arrival - to sleep and get back to 'normal' again.
@TheTrueCalliope sleep on the plane, sleep on the bus, LIVE AND LOVE LONDON, and then sleep on bus and plane back again. That's how I do it!
@TheTrueCalliope London anways. Time's too precious there to waste it with sleep!
@TheTrueCalliope I soo feel ya. Still havent booked but the ones I looked at landed around the same time so yeah... but hey NOBODY sleep in
@TheTrueCalliope *snorts* wouldnt actually surprise me, they're weird.
@TheTrueCalliope you'D be surprised how many land that early *lol* and yes, the time difference!!!
@TheTrueCalliope ONLY if they have a free seat, that'S the downside of it, hence me telling to plan generously.
@TheTrueCalliope without additional costs.
@TheTrueCalliope and if you're too early you can stil try and see if you can take an earlier bus - if there's still space, they can take you
@TheTrueCalliope i landed 'late' last time, you could be lucky. Still, keep it in mind. A 8:30'ish bus should be good.
@TheTrueCalliope last time and had to run for tge bus. Always plan a bit more time, just in case. Rather wait than run. Esp w/luggage.
@TheTrueCalliope that can happen yes but never happened to me. What time are you landing? Don't underestimate customs: took me 45 mins the
@TheTrueCalliope just be on time and make sure you're actually supposed tk be on THAT bus and you should be fine. Never had any isssues.
@TheTrueCalliope its not really comfy, and you sometimes have to stuff your suitcase yourself in but it's cheap and thats all i need.
@TheTrueCalliope had any troubles. Just plan enough time between touchdown and bus take off (90 mins ti 2 hours should do)
@TheTrueCalliope nevermind, saw it. Easybus! Cheap and if you dont mind  a little less space its totally fine. I always use them and never
@TheTrueCalliope *lol*you poor thing. When are you landing where and where do you want to go?
@rox712 nope! Not getting old. Bit then again, can one call it dress when it barely covers... well, anything?  @Arlessiar
@SignsAndClues never actually hope here. Very rarely not disappointed :-/
@Arlessiar im sure there were a few nice ones but those I've seen?!?! O_o Jesus Christ! I wouldnt even leave the house like that! @rox712
@SignsAndClues which means, whole queueu knows it... i want to be in that cafe!!!!
@SignsAndClues did we expect anything else???
@rox712 oh thank  goodness!!! I thought that was just me!!!!

@JohnFinnemore say, even for me who has lived here for over 30 years. You could even have me as tour guide... ;-)

#sherlockedevent 
#Sherlocked 
@lebearpolare yeah well, apparently you are... it's a  very clever book!

@kirstielouadams :-) Same here but every once in a while it's a good thing.
@LindaOF61 hi Linda, and I totally agree on that statement!! :-D @kirstielouadams
@kirstielouadams I can imagine. For once normal is something desirable :-)
@kirstielouadams hey wow, that'S great!  Must be strange though, going back to work after such a long time. Just take it easy.
@kirstielouadams and it only got better over time - overall I mean. First season was horrible acting! *lol* But it's gotten so much better!
@kirstielouadams ah, see, *I* didn't hear that. Although I did hear that Doyle (from #Angel) was Irish! *iz a bit proud)
@kirstielouadams AH. Guess it's me and my adoration for (almost) everything British that I loved it *hides*
@kirstielouadams I know right?! Such a cuite!
@kirstielouadams English goodness in it my first time watching (dubbed and dull). ALL HAIL RUPERT GILES!!!
@kirstielouadams WHAT?? WHY? I love all the accents (but then again, that's nit really a surprise) I'm soo sad I missed out on all the
@kirstielouadams BUT I had three or four epis with a baby CK already - soooo young (okay, make that five epis now!)
@kirstielouadams still a few seasons to go. About to finish S1 here in about two epis!
@kirstielouadams *hehe* Just wait for the half nakes James Marsters, also very nice!!! *grins* And I'm very much looking forward to the tats
@kirstielouadams he always keeps you on your toes - always expect the unexpected! Never boring! He's a GOD!!!
@kirstielouadams TOLD YA!!! Welcome to hel!! *grins* he's just fantastic! And EVIL! VERY VERY EVIL!!!
@kirstielouadams to actually know what they're talking about!)
@kirstielouadams yup, you can't really watch out of order, otherwise you don't really get most of the stuff (still works but it's more fun
@kirstielouadams ever will be!!!
@kirstielouadams Whedon is a fucking master genius. Evil as hell (which you will find out soon) but most amazing writer there was, is and
@kirstielouadams a bit, yes. Watched Bones AGES ago, never got it really.  but still after Buffy and Angel, which were my first real love!
@kirstielouadams ahh, halfway through! And hey, not bad to look at. And hes got some hilarious lines! Be prepared fro some heartbreak tho.
Gunn, sweetie, holding a stake like this will get you killed in five seconds flat. Just saying... #Angel
@kirstielouadams UI!!! *claps hands* Liking it so far? (which epi/season are you at?)
GUNN!!! #Angel

@NiceGoalEh as long as it works!!!
@NiceGoalEh No, i know! I've taught you well!
uhhhhh... #UntaggedAvocado O_O

Not sure whether or not to be pissed or just laugh: pissy client from earlier was complaining about ANOTHER HAIRDRESSER! Nobody from us!!!
@Arlessiar *hugs* and even worse is that they all dont even listen when i try to explain that i cant help *headdesks* people!!!
Dear pissed off costumers: STOP complaining to ME about sth colleagues did. Im not your trash can; i dont know what happened so i cant help!
why the hell am I awake???? *pouts and gets more coffee*
i need a haircut (and some colour) so very badly!!!! *makes note to make an appointement with boss* #BecauseGrowingLikeWeed
highly amused that @whedonesque always seems to know what episode im watching  (or watched very recently) and quote those #AreYouGuysMagic?
What??? Why??? O_O "@cumberbatchfrm: No #Sherlock nomination in the best mini series category #BAFTATV"
*grrr* just when I have to leave for work *fingers crossed for #TeamSherlock though* #BaftaTV2015

@Lexington_75 I really hope so!!!
@Lexington_75 I can imagine. So very happy for you (and everyone)! I'll be stalking the LL accounts now for some vids.
@Lexington_75 eh, as long as some family time awaits you, its a good thing. I should get ready as well, off to parents in a bit.
@Lexington_75 as will anyone else, I suppose: must've been very intense from what I've read. *keeps blazing jealousy at bay*
@Lexington_75 so no lazy Easter Sunday for you then?
@Lexington_75 I can imagine. Been looking for you in the few pics that came through but havent found you yet.
@Lexington_75 ouch, sounds like it was a long (well short) night then!
@Lexington_75 you know, that's sooo not helping with the TRYING of not being jealous?! ;-p So happy to hear it was such a sucess!
Uh shit, THAT scene is due today, isnt it?!?! *shudders* I fucking HATE that one, ALWAYS skipped it! #Outlander
#Outlander time!!!!
Happy Easter everyone (or happy Sunday).
"Angel Investigations, we hope you're helpless." *giggles* #Angel

@letterslive stop teasing meeeeee!!! *sobs* I'll be just sitting here, in cold, grey Germany, sulking once more...But y'all have a blast =)
*sits back and waits for her follower count to drop like a bomb*
@Lexington_75 I can only imagine... :-)
@Lexington_75 very very pretty. Must be fantastic to be there.
@Lexington_75 Thank you. And I'll be stalking what I can stalk from here *grins* The venue looks absolutely stunning.
@Lexington_75 plus here's hope we'll get some of the videos that apparently have been filmed soon...
@Lexington_75 to that. And hey, it doesn't need that much for me wanting to come over. Will def keep my eyes peeled.
@Lexington_75 i so have missed that *shakes head as self* But then again, the US is even further away so probably didn't pay any attention
@Lexington_75 what??? They do?! Uii, that would be great! Although coming over is so much nicer... as you know ;-)
@Lexington_75 next time... hopefully.

@GenyDeee you know that i have to move in with you then... (Thanks)
@GenyDeee dont drool on me, droolmon the DL once you have it. (Remind  me to upload it, please?!)

@SignsAndClues what??? She is??? Why wasnt i notified??? Dear @Arlessiar MAKE IT STOP! ITS VERY UNPLEASANT! NOW!
slightly amused yet curious... i hope they set him a time limit. Otherwise hes going to waffle about for hours (not that thats a bad thing).
Huh???
@plantinstructie will definitely keep that jn mind for the next time!
Hmmm, apparently complaining loudly works: rain and wind stopped and the sun's coming out.
Whoever pissed off the weathergod, stop it!!!! Its very unpleasant.
woah, stormy as hell outside. Bit scared at having to leave the house in a bit... O_o

@LonelyGirl1217 Genius and GOD!!! YES!!
@HollyLyn1217 Plus I have the CD!
@HollyLyn1217 I can'T really remember whether or not they cut that for German television. Watched it once and then always the original!
@HollyLyn1217 O_O WHAT THE FUCK!?!??!!?

@HollyLyn1217 THEY CHOPPED IT FOR TELLY?1?1ß1 WHATS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?!?!?!
@HollyLyn1217 and whats with all the carrots... GAH!!! I FUCKING LOVE THIS ONE!!!!
BUNNIES!!!!!

@PaulCarella never a waste of time watching Tony being all Tony!!!
@GenyDeee O_O .... oh. I must've missed that.... still, no open fire which is good! *pats shoulder awkwardly* @SignsAndClues
@SignsAndClues *giggles* Come on, she's not that bad, she hasnt burned anything in ages! *squishes @GenyDeee so she doesnT get mad*
@SignsAndClues *giggles* the equivalent to old school candles.
@SignsAndClues *hides along so you're not alone* I swear, I didn't send it!
@SignsAndClues WHAT??? I didn't send over anything, must've found its way on its own...
woah, weather, calm down, will ya?!?! #Thunderstorm
@GenyDeee very happy to hear that! Bit jealous too. But mostly happy :-)
@GenyDeee *hehe* hell yeah, using you being all spellbound the best I can! ;-p
and that's #S5 done! Off to S6. And only 6 epis away from OMWF!!! *claps hands excitedly* #Buffy
UHHH!!! #Tease
Empire Awards live stream guy: NOT funny! *glares*
uiii, expired pain pills still working.... and fast!!!
@GenyDeee magical Geny! And no need to hide her, we already know! And noting will convince me otherwise!!!! @rox712
@rox712 she's magic, that'S what she is!!! *nods* @GenyDeee
@GenyDeee HA! I knew it!!!
@GenyDeee told you, I've watched that a few times as well but still... You ARE magic!!!
@GenyDeee I still don't understand how you can be only TWO episode behind, you started with almost two SEASONS!!!! O_o you magic?
@GenyDeee *hands over tissues*
@TequilaKaniac HA! Totally. So very glad when Sis moved from third to ground, we could move stuf through the window *lol*
@TequilaKaniac *eheh* can Imagine, they'd be all over them! yeah, def worth it, saves a lot of stress and nerves and trouble.
@TequilaKaniac man's cat - loved all the men visiting parents, no matter whether he knew them or not.
@TequilaKaniac some seems to like men more, parent's one likes hubby even though he's there not that often. And their old one was a total
@TequilaKaniac *giggles*
@TequilaKaniac I love that. Shows that every  kitty has their own personality. And sounds like they fit perfectly to you two!
@TequilaKaniac *lol*
@TequilaKaniac clever kitties!!
@TequilaKaniac AWWWW!! You need to stop or I'll never get rid of the idea of wanting one too. *sighs*
ohh Willow...
@TequilaKaniac *tee hee* well, you've got them for a while now, must be a subconscious thing.
@TequilaKaniac bites and scratches if they try to touch her even though they're there more otften than me! Weird one *lol*
@TequilaKaniac evil but even though I don't see her very often I am the one allowed to pet her at all. She always screams at my parents and
@TequilaKaniac d'awwww!!! That sounds lovely. Parent's cat isnt very cuddly but allows me to pet every now and then. And Sis's one is pure
@TequilaKaniac kitty.
@TequilaKaniac far too long for a kitty to be alone. And no chance for it to go out here. Oh well, have to stick with my parents and Sis's
@TequilaKaniac yeah but two would also require a bit more money and all and I can't really afford that. And we're out 9 hours which I think
@TequilaKaniac and getting two would be too much.
@TequilaKaniac getting a kitty too, I#d love to have one around but w're out all day and I'd hate for it to be all alone all day.
@TequilaKaniac good, probably better to save them the stress. And hey, they'll be all curious once they moved in. *sighs* Im so pondering
@TequilaKaniac well, if anyone can manage that, it's you and your better half! How are the kitties taking it?
@TequilaKaniac busy little bee! When do you have to be out there?
@TequilaKaniac time flies these days.  That's good, always nice to have sth you actually like.
@TequilaKaniac THREE years already? Felt lke you just moved there. yeah, alwayys hated packing myself.
@TequilaKaniac Uh, that sucks, sorry to hear that. hope the new place is for longer then.
@TequilaKaniac *hmpf* nothing new there then, eh!? One day it'll bite him in the ass.
@TequilaKaniac I saw, you're moving again?! But YAY for going at all! and YAY for going to the RIGHT one!!!!
@TequilaKaniac over for MONTHS!
@TequilaKaniac *snorts* yeah, figured that. Wondering how he wants to explain that and don'T tell me t's SHORT NOTICE, they knew they'd be
@TequilaKaniac *snorts* going to be fucking interesting! Bit sad I can't go but I'd knew where I'd be! What the fuck where they thinking?!?!
@TequilaKaniac but right now, after Joyce's funeral she'S even more annoying than before!
@TequilaKaniac episode she'S NOT in!
@TequilaKaniac I've never liked her and right now she's behaving like the perfect little brat she is!!! *grrrrr* I'm happy over every damn
and I'm back to wanting to smack Dawn over the head repeatedly...
and most importantly: no music which makes it even more eerie and enhances the  amazing cast!
yet as fucking HEARTBREAKING as this epi is, it's also the perfect example for the GENIUS that is Whedon: simple filming and pure acting.
see, that's why I'm having trust issues!!! *shakes fist* DAMN YOU WHEDON!!!! *glares*
and that was the very first (but not the last) time I hated the writers with the fire of a thousand suns!!! #Buffy #S5E16
great #StageIt show, thank you @PaulCarella!
Happy #EarthHour 2015! 
*makes sure to NOT do anything on that April weekend* going to be veeeeeeeery interesting... *gets popcorn*
@LonelyGirl1217 AH!  *is not asking*
@LonelyGirl1217 boy REALLY needs a smack over the head... repeatedly. *shakes head*
@LonelyGirl1217 it, I'd prolly had chose Steve - still my #1. Still sucks so fucking much. Cursed pretty fucking loudly this morning. That
@LonelyGirl1217 I was sad that I couldn't fit Steve in this year (as of now) but this? Wouldve prolly killed me... although if I think about
@LonelyGirl1217 are they completely insane?!?! This'll wreck totaly havoc! That weekend's going to be 'fun' [insert heavy sarcasm here]
@LonelyGirl1217 saw it this morning and was very happy I can't go (coulnd't before and won't now). I mean, WHAT THE FUCK were they thinking?
*wanders around flat and scatters candles for @earthhour* nice hot bath first though, perhaps it soothes the pain in the neck.
@SouthlandJulz let me know.if you want to join there then I'll send you the invite so you dont have to wait for weeks.
@SouthlandJulz *hehe* one of my firsts kept me up all night because i couldn't stop. Good night, sweet, uneventful  (aka not creepy) dreams.
@SouthlandJulz such talent, it always blows me away.

@SouthlandJulz *snorts* hell no, we're still waiting... the fandom that waited, thats us. Eh,  its nice, easy to navigate, posting as many
@SouthlandJulz plus much more Sherlock and BC fics these days.
@SouthlandJulz right back at ya, love(d) your writing. But i mostly post on AO3 now and only link there from LJ, posting is easier that way.
@SouthlandJulz and edit them a bit) but hey, second language for me so im very proud of them all. :-)
@SouthlandJulz my really early stuff does that to me too. But i still love all my babies (although one day I'll go over them all and correct
@SouthlandJulz try. Although the new pairings give me more to work with. Definitely improved my writing and my vocabulary since back then.
@SouthlandJulz uhhh nice *claps hands* ive read a couple of my old stuff lately and would love to write that pairing again. Might give it a
@SouthlandJulz absolutely nothing! The  muse needs to be fed!!! What are you writing if i may ask?
@SouthlandJulz dude,  you are good at writing. Would definitely a way to practice and hone those skills tho :-)
@SouthlandJulz it. *shakes head* the mind goes  wondrous ways when sleeping.
@SouthlandJulz the having to pee i get (had that before) but the other thing...? So don't get.
@SouthlandJulz *lol* very vivid, very creepy and slightly sexual. There. Thats definitely TMI O_o
a full bladder at night and an aching neck make for the oddest dreams/nightmares... #RandomObservation #TMI
Oh wow... THAT's something I didn't expect O_o way to make people choose.... sort of glad I'm NOT going.
Eloquent!!  That was the word. Very eloquent (as always) :-)
hmmm, that was lovely. perfect end of the day. Off to bed now. Good night Twitter :-)
woah, cheekbones much!!! O_o
*purrs happily* American accent.... &lt;3

errant curl is an errant strand and it's equally adorable and irritating &lt;3 #TIG
*pauses #Buffy marathon* I think tonight is a Benedict Cumberbatch night! #TIG I'll never get tired of that film.
poor darlin has no clue what to do with his hair when it's that short, huh?! Or did he just roll out of bed like that?!
*sighs happily* gah, I have forgotten how amazing that man sounds in a church...
@LonelyGirl1217 im going to be green with envy, am I!?!?? *hates you in advance*
@GenyDeee  Creating the next generation of fandom, are you!? i already see you (us) taking him along to the next JM gig, eh!?!?
@GenyDeee eh, rewatched that a few times too so youre still good.

Utterly shocked  here... #Germanwings
@Cumbertater someone's very smitten right now, eh?! :-p Cant wait to see it when i get off work.
seriously, that man's magic! How the fuck does he manage to look like fucking 20 when he's almost 40?!?! *shakes head and is off to work*
good morning, Gorgeous!
@GenyDeee you will know, I'm sure. And no, not yet. Waiting for him to show up but I think that was later. Dealing with Glory right now...
@GenyDeee and I just realized that out of context this sounds really really weird *lol*
@GenyDeee I did however check the latest famous face I had last night... *hehe*
@GenyDeee I recognized the voice but due to time and the vamp face I didn't realize who he was and I was too lazy to check.
@GenyDeee I KNEW I KNEW THAT FACE AND THAT VOICE BUT COULDNT PLACE HIM!!!!! O_O
Barry, you might wanna shut up NOW! #TheFlash
poor Cisco, he cant really win, can he?! Poor baby #TheFlash
Spike's just as bad as comforting others as Sherlock is *coos quietly*
@GenyDeee because of reasons: 

somebody PLEASE put a stake in Harmony, she's REALLY getting on my nerves now!!!
HA! Dawn's my Cas now - very happy over every damn epi she's NOT in! #Buffy
is it just me or does pissed off Spike sounds more English than not pissed off Spike? #Buffy
@GenyDeee That is NOT better... poor baby! *pets him in a purely fatherly sort of way*
@GenyDeee EXCUSE YOU?!?!?! .... uhm... im not quite sure hat to think about that.... *slowly backs away from the interwebs*
@GenyDeee HA! YES!! Thank you!
