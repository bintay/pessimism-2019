@WolffJacob no it's coincidental. what is hominen? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WolffJacob don't take it personal. I'm just crazy

@Kyle_Swims_Fly yeah lol my gov teacher lost our summer assignments. but I meant more like blaming the teacher for failing them on purpose
can't stand when people blame their teacher for their bad grade. you EARN your grades. if I can earn an A, you can avoid receiving an F
I spend an hour or two worrying about college then another hour or two worrying about prom. I go back &amp; forth and I can't stop <WEARY FACE>
the MOST important thing to remember is that everything happens for a reason &amp; it's not the end of the world. things will always end up ok
March 16th needs to hurry, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I want to know <PERSEVERING FACE>
@donyel_marie @Kyle_Swims_Fly we'd have so much fun!

I wish my SAT score was at least a 2000. I'll always regret not retaking it <PERSEVERING FACE>
I don't think anything could make me happy at the moment
I've said so many times that I'm done being nice but I know I'm not. so I'll just continue being taken for granted
I'm so unappreciated. I'd like to say "when I'm gone people will finally notice" but I even have doubts that'll happen
I give &amp; give &amp; listen to people when they're down &amp; go out of my way for people &amp; pay &amp; take people places but I get treated like crap
literally everyone dislikes me... idk why because I have literally done so much for everyone. I'm always there to help out &amp; be a friend
@Nannaisdope okay
I'm still not 17 &amp; a half and I'm graduating in 3 months
so annoying
my phone is dying but it's ok <UNAMUSED FACE>
