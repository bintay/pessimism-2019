@MissLovelyLayla that's how I was able to get this dress for my honeymoon.

@JudgNJurie in politics candidates will be described in many ways.  You don't see males complaining of sexism when called the same, etc.
@JudgNJurie you have ur opinions.  But seriously, what about polarizing, calculating &amp; ambitious is sexist? Many males are called that.
This right here epitomizes the quirky awesomeness of #HartofDixie! #HartOfDixieFinale 
Dang you @CW_network! I knew deep down it was a series finale but Kept hoping it was just the season finale. #HartofDixie #HartOfDixieFinale

Technically, since I am a woman, if I use the #HillarysBannedWords to refer to her, is it considered #sexism? Because they all apply to her.
#HRCSuperVolunteers, calling @HillaryClinton all those #HillarysBannedWords isn't "coded sexism".  It's the truth.
@Matthops82 you are totally reading this correctly.

@KeithWHowley @cnn I'm not a big Palin fan but we call people names like trash when we don't know them personally. That's just wrong IMO.
@KeithWHowley @CNN are you a close family friend of theirs or are you going by what's on the news to make ur judgement that they're trash?
@CNN can't we just wish them well and congratulate them? I bet everyone would consider it news if it was a celebrity. Stop hating.

If you were so torn about marrying another woman, then you are not in love, Chris.  But what do I know? #TheBachelor #TheBachelorFinale
I feel like Whitney is trying to convince Chris she's the one. #TheBachelor #TheBachelorFinale

@robertelessar but we will agree to disagree.  That's the beauty of a free country. :)
@robertelessar you may want to consider you own narrow mind in the assumption about my "smarts" because of me liking a particular movie.
@BarbaraNiven @Ali_Sweeney oh I love the books! Can't wait!
@FirstTeamSol @jjauthor I will. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> We're actually both Army officers. We love our profession &amp; this country tremendously.
This may not mean much but from most of my Army peeps to @AmericanSniper: you got it right &amp; we thank you for Kyle &amp; his family. #TheOscars
@FirstTeamSol @jjauthor (2/2) he said "this is the answer to those times u ask me what its like to be in combat having to do this job.
@FirstTeamSol @jjauthor (1/2) my fiancé is Infantry officer &amp; he told me that after watching that Bradley/Clint Eastwood got it right.
@STERLINGMHOLMES birdman and the stupid Budapest hotel movie were ridiculous.  I could even finish watching the last one.
Oh lookie here-- giving thanks to the new generation of who are here thanks to-- their illegal parents. #OnlyInHollywood #TheOscads
@jjauthor I wasn't shocked because those mainly liberals in Hollywood wouldn't be caught dead voting for this movie. But so proud of Bradley
So now I can say Birdman sucked and The Budapest Hotel sucked.  #TheOscars #TheOscars2015

@washingtonpost @rick_n so when an attack happens &amp; don't have any guns, everyone in the country can ask "why didnt they didn't have guns?"
@ByronYork yes we should.  In my workplace this kind of behavior would incur in at least a counseling statement.

@charlescwcooke @KatiePavlich so true and if I could do it all over again I would probably go to a trade school instead of college.
@rezeqnaim @PalestineSocial wow u so misunderstood my comment which wasn't about comparing losses but the heartbroken families left behind.
Had the shooter been a right wing Christian this would be all over the news as hate crime. But he's a left-wing atheist. #ChapelHillShooting
@PalestineSocial this is a terrible incident. Just like all the kids who won't see a loved one because they've been killed by terrorists.

@AsFaisal54 I get your point.  All in saying is that in this case it was not the case.
@AsFaisal54 to be fair, he was not a Christian but an atheist.
@piersmorgan For once I agree with you.  And to let this story take root is irresponsible.  This is such a sad day.
The story that the #ChapelHillShooting happened because of a parking spot is like saying #Benghazi happened because of a video.  Shameful.

I love Esmeralda's dad.   #LaGataUS

@AmyMek @RealJamesWoods omg, my fiancé mentioned this at dinner. I wouldn't be surprised.
James Comey: ISIS active in 49 of 50 states.  Susan Rice: ISIS not of an existential nature.  We are so screwed? #WakeUpAmerica
@EMAdair225 @jjauthor yet not of an existential nature.  These people are just smoking something good in DC.
Today #lungcancer claimed the life of another person in my life.  God definitely received one of His most beautiful angels.  #cancer
So we have NO #NationalSecurityStrategy &amp; how is ISIS not an existential threat? The same was probably said about the Nazis. #WakeUpAmerica
I'm not a huge @CNN or @wolfblitzer fan but wow, #VoicesOfAuschwitz was so beautifully done.  Thank you for this.  Everyone should watch it.
You can read books about the Holocaust but nothing prepares you for the powerful testimony of survivors. <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>  #VoicesOfAuschwitz
Hey Susan Rice! Stay tune for @CNN's #VoicesOfAuschwitz.  Nobody thought Nazis were of an "existential nature" either &amp; this happened.
@ThisIsKCcom how did you not include @cookieandkate? One of the best KC accounts on IG.
So we have NO #NationalSecurityStrategy &amp; how is ISIS not an existential threat? Probably what was said about Nazis. The incompetence. Smh.

Interesting how quickly people throw the #Crusades in the face of Christians when it was in part a defensive response to Islamic conquest.
@BreitbartNews @charliespiering Going to go out on a limb here &amp; say the muslimization of US &amp; not how to stop the growth of #RadicalIslam.
The Christians at the #NationalPrayerBreakfast should have gotten up and walk out.
So we cannot say #RadicalIslam but today O grouped all #Christians under the banner of the Crusades.  Got it. #NationalPrayerBreakfast
@dhiggins63 so agree.  Did you see this? It was pretty epic. :)
