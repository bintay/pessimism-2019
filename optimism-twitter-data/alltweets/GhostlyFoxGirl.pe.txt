Fuck
I should really sleep but I can't
If that meteor really does crash into the earth in three days time at least I'll get out of most of my a levels
Anyway I'm a sleepy lil bird so good night, be lovely to yourselves and each other <CHICKEN>
My favourite activity is watching Americans on the Internet confuse themselves trying to work out British humour
I've completely lost interest in the YouTube community somewhat bc of all the crap that's gone down U know
Ok but seriously I haven't actually watched a YouTube video deliberately in months like I will watch it if it comes up on my TL
I miss 2010 where youtubers weren't problematic ppl weren't afraid to say what they wanted and being cringey was cool
Remember when I said I was inactive...
To be fair I am a complete wuss when it comes to cold weather like I love it and it's better than hot weather but I have bad tolerance
@bi0musicology U r lovely thank u
Dry skin makes me shudder
@bi0musicology it is on some but my eyes just look really weird omg
Did u know freckles R a mutation also. Basically I'm a mutant
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS JUST THINKING BC HE SAID IT WAS GROOVEY 
I have always wondered why my eyes r so strange
I told my mum and she was like yeah I know you're mutant. THNX SO MUCH
So today I learnt I have central heterochromia wow would U look at that
I very much appreciate ppl who r kind to me and respect them but I deserve some respect somewhat also PLS remember
And that was not an invitation to suddenly bombard me with asks about the very thing I said I was uncomfortable with. UR not funny
Rude so I reply but I'm going to stop now
I'm sorry if this seems mean but I honestly am not comfortable with people I don't know saying things like that to me, I don't want to be
Please can people stop sending me asks about wanting to date me !!!! I know u mean well but it actually makes me feel very uncomfortable
my sister and i have such a love hate relationship
@accidentaIgay FUCK OFF
@emmapursang TYSM !!
@accidentaIgay tHAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE TWEETED TO YOU
@accidentaIgay @ me next time xoxo

My sister and I have been talking about bands and have made it our mission to meet all time low and of mice &amp; men
@wigglywalters @animekittens this is why I'm queer af

@animekittens green tea or herbal tea !!!! Make sure u drink it whilst it's still hot it will help so much
I hate myself xx
It's really hot and I don't like it this is not how Britain is supposed to be we are known for our mild weather
When I am a grandfather I will tell my children of the days of the frog meme
Vic fuentes just tweeted an actual tweet not a photo or an Instagram link is this the end of us or just a means to start again
@piercethevic what breakfast do you get? <TWO HEARTS>
I just had a thought. If #PSYA1 was easy they're bound to have made #PSYA2 hard. Praying for anything but
Ah yes this is my farm. Harvest comes when the adults are fully grown. All organic you see
Saying "full grown adult" just makes me think of people being planted in very large pots and being grown like flowers
I feel like frank iero is my precious son who needs protecting he is a grown adult but he is my little buddy
I hope everyone's exams went okay and that ur ALL feeling fantastic

If my thighs weren't so big I think I'd actually look ok
twitter accounts that r dedicated to making sadness seem "relatable" are the kind of twitter accounts which shouldn't be allowed to exist:)
@novellipoppunk i just turned to my friend and said "we just got told to shut up by a midget"

@PASTAPILOTS we had a different exam bud
@witchyvibez happy birthday !!!
@accidentaIgay ME TOO but my parents said not until I've done all my exams smh
@SciFiPhiChiPsi @trxshfairy misunderstanding what privation will do to the nhs it is still not a great change
@SciFiPhiChiPsi @trxshfairy yeah but the privation is still a big issue its not the right way to go about things so even tho people R
Anyway I'm not talking about psych anymore it's over it's done with I will not think of it again
@trxshfairy @SciFiPhiChiPsi the Tories will make it worse
@trxshfairy @SciFiPhiChiPsi we will have no choice but to pay privately if we want care. The mental health services are shit as it is,
@trxshfairy @SciFiPhiChiPsi they are taking millions from the mental health aspects of the nhs, so quality of care will decrease until
@AQA I know #PSYA1 was easy but please don't make the grade boundaries high think of the children
@emmapursang I KNOW
@DEERLINGPNG PLEASE TELL ME U ARE DOING GCSES BECAUSE 23 AS EXAMS WOULD KILL YOU
@bearsarefab nope
@emmapursang you do a levels you take between 3 and 5 they're extremely hard and yeah you do half one year and half the other
@emmapursang we take GCSEs when we are 15-16 and we take around 13 subjects so 20 exams or so and then you go to post 16 options and if
@emmapursang the exams every year don't count towards anything I don't RLLY know how to explain it to someone who isn't British but like
@MyJellyRomance for Gcses we had 20 so it's not as bad as that, Google is UR best friend bud
I feel like the British school system is a lot more demanding exam wise because we have such a huge amount of them
@emmapursang you can choose to go to college or be an apprentice but if you're in school they're compulsory
@emmapursang yep you have to do them and they're extremely difficult and horrible
@MyJellyRomance a levels man, a levels
@TurnaboutAdam if the grade boundaries are high it means Even if I've done well i won't get an A because of the boundaries
@emmapursang yes we do but Gcses and a levels are special exams specifically towards you going to university
Okay but I'm kinda scared bc we all found the psychology exam easy meaning the grade boundaries R gonna be super high
Question: why did Marsha not help the guy that was stabbed? #PSYA1
@ghiblicats HECK YEAH
@ghiblicats LOVE U RAT

It's so weird that like. I'm starting my a level exams today. Next June I'll have left school yet I still feel like I'm 11 years old
Nigel Farage was on the breakfast show my parents were watching so I was yelling at the TV for him to get a job to see how he liked it
Good luck to everyone taking exams today !!
Psychology isn't until 1pm so I've got a while thank god
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh exams start today
#youtubefandomhonestyhour youtubers are regular people and we need to stop acting as if they can do no wrong. Especially when they do
I am seventeen next month and I'm sitting here cuddling my Spider-Man blanket
#youtubefandomhonestyhour I miss the YouTube where I didn't have to worry whether  or not someone I watch has committed sexual assault.
(I'm watching HP1)
I have a deep founded love for Rupert Grint and his adorable 12 year old face
Why do we have to take five a levels who decided that was an okay thing
I am so scared for my psychology exam tomorrow I don't feel at all prepared :-(
Smile :-) U are not a frog meme and in that respect U are winning today
@christianovelli I'm sure it is fantastic give urself more credit novelli
People forget that they r good, I think
You are so wanted and needed on this earth !!! Do not measure UR worth against others for it is not possible
Whilst it is true that the earth wouldn't stop spinning if you were gone, there r people who love u so much that they would want it to !
Look around you!!!!! Ur alive !!!! On an earth filled w billions of people !!!!! With stars above your head !!!! What a beautiful existence
Christian is such a great person honestly I do not understand how someone as golden as him can exist

If you are doing Psychology A Level, with any exam board, I really recommend the app 'PsychRevise'. It's so helpful and it's free !!
"Exams tomorrow" 
ok i gotta do psychology revision bc its in 24 hours oh god
There's no point hoping for low grade boundaries because a low grade boundary at a level is like 80% for a b

Be unconditionally wonderful to one another, and have a nice night <TWO HEARTS>
Anyway it's 10pm and I wanna do some revision before bed so bye
I can't get over why you would think its okay to tell people to kill themselves or self harm or die. What the fuck is wrong with you?
There are some really disgusting people in the world

don't expect mainstream media coverage, they will always ignore the important issues in favour of licking the boots of politicians.
#ToriesOutNow the decisions made now will affect our generation more than any other. yet we have no say? that is not democracy.
"people voted for them!" yes they did but only 39% of the millions of people who voted were Tory voters. that's not a majority #ToriesOutNow
#ToriesOutNow to people saying it's a riot: it's not. the police are the means of violence here.
#ToriesOutNow my view 
ive forgotten what i was gonna tweet but i promise it was hilarious and would have probably made me twitter famous

@Catstielthazar i am hoping and praying to every fucking angel out there that she is not dead
#FirstDateQuestions does our subconscious have language? are we experiencing the same things or is reality subjective? whats yr fave colour?

@PASTAPILOTS LOVE U SO MUCH

My dad just walked on me singing I will always love you and eating mini cheddars this is my design
@ghiblicats remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?
Guess who is staying w Bekah in June <SQUARED COOL>
@ people who live near newcastle do u wanna hang on the 21st june
I WANT THE FACT NIGEL FARAGE DIDNT GET HIS SEAT ENGRAVED ON MY GRAVESTONE AND TATTOOED ON MY FOREHEAD THERE IS A GOD
@PASTAPILOTS omg can we please revise together for psych on Sunday
The Tories are a party for the rich and well off, the fact they're in power is disgusting
I thought the possibility of the Tories being in power was a bad dream but I guess not. Time to get extremely intoxicated for five years
@onehturt my dad has to go private because the NHS refuse to pay for his health care. He has to pay thousands each month. So sit down.
I'm gonna go this is actually stressing me out I'll complain about the results in the morning
@PASTAPILOTS I'm okay Hun just stressed about this election oh man
I'm not watching bc Im too anxious lol
@DangHowell <SQUARED COOL>
.@Conservatives remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?
go untreated and possibly die from either physical or mental illness, so don't you dare say this isn't an issue
- so imagine if it was privatised. People who can afford it don't understand how important free health care is, without it many people would
My family have worked for the NHS for years and ive seen how fucking incredible they can be. That all changed when funding was cut -
@_WhereIsYourGod exactly!! People need the support the NHS can give
If the NHS is privatised suicide rates will go up, fatalities from physical illness will go up, and the country will be fucked.
Ok but if the nhs gets privatised the amount of people who won't be able to afford health care and will go UNTREATED will be disgusting
I have watched the same Harry Potter film three times in the last two days
Hagrid: I can't tell you the thing
Hagrid: *tells the thing*
Hagrid: I should not have told you the thing
If homosexuals can control the weather you'd think UKIP would try and appease us not anger us and the oncoming storm
I love Firenze in Harry Potter he is a chill dude
Ok but forget about politics for a moment can we just discuss how perfect and wonderful and just angel emoji bekah is
UKIP: homophobic purple cunts 
Tories: bye bye nhs
Lib dems: liars
Green: yay! Good to youth
Labour: good for workâ€¦
Ok but no matter the outcome of the election im not gonna be happy so I'm moving to Mars who is with me
@DangHowell @accidentaIgay I DONT LOOK LIKE A CABBAGE
@DangHowell @accidentaIgay UR French there is no way we are putting U in charge frog
I'm gay and straight im the best of both worlds x  
how about we just scrap the government and put me in charge
@jetpackblews yep and it would be beyond expensive
My way of comforting my friends is to tell them to shut up until they stop hating themselves
@ghiblicats SHUT UP
@ghiblicats no
@ghiblicats love u too
My favourite thing is harry opening the broomstick in year one and genuinely not having a clue WHAT THE BROOM SHAPED PACKAGE WAS
@ghiblicats shut up
Anyway
@propsandmayhxm I know it's disgusting and damaging and I am so worried
Ok politics make me anxious im gonna sleep
If the Tories win the election Britain will have essentially royally fucked up the NHS well done
I am so scared for our country. We need a government that cares as much about us as we do, and I don't think the Tories are the answer.
If the Tories win all of us are gonna be drowning in debt and the fuck ups of our government within the next five years
UKIP THINKING THEYRE GONNA B THE BEST THING EVER YET THE EXIT POLLS SAY THEY HAVE TWO SEATS IM CRYING
@ghostpolaroids Ah well since exams are next week I think I've managed kinda !!! Thank u :)

whats the point of spending another month after exams in school to start A2 courses like what is the point of that
@ouranliguori oh okay that explains it because you have like finals each year right?? u dont do like nationals
@accidentaIgay this is what they're doing w me but i'm like 80% sure i'm leaving
ppl asking why i have to go back to sixth form after I've done my AS exams: i'm in year 12, year 12s have to go back
@ouranliguori ahh what year are you in
@annaxlanna because its year 12
i hate the fact that on june 8th i have to go back to sixth form even though i would have done all my exams i hate life
@ouranliguori oh well if u dont have exams then thats probably why u have so much time left
so i have four more days of school, then five weeks of exams, and then i have to go back for 7 weeks i hate everything
@accidentaIgay prolonged exposure to me

@sophielweeden ITS SUCH A STRUGGLE
The thing about gcse is that losing five marks or so doesn't make a difference but at a level you can lose a whole grade sometimes two
If you're super stressed about exams but can't bring yourself to revise clap your hands
A 60 mark exam and 100 mark exam for chemistry along w 40 marks from coursework and I'm gonna get a strong 4 overall probably
So many of my favourite bands are performing at reading frick MY FAVOURITE band are playing at reading I wish it wasn't so expensive

@feelslikefob I know oh my god
People who say things like "retweet and i won't kill myself/self harm/starve myself" are the reason mental illness has such a stigma.
A real friend would get their friend professional help not use their problems to get retweets.  
Someone who is actually suicidal won't be magically cured by retweets sweetheart. Stop being so disrespectful  
"50 retweets and my friend won't kill herself" shut the fuck up. It's attention seeking and disrespectful to use mental illness for retweets
My first a level exam is a week today I'm so scared
MY PARENTS  
I am so in love w David Tennant

When people romanticise anxiety I'm just like. Ok tell me more as I feel knives scrape up and down my throat and my chest tightening 24/7
Ok but I feel like I'm gonna be sick
@animekittens this is actually what I did last Thursday
Why do we say things R as cool as a cucumber. Why r cucumbers the coolest thing. Who decided that. Why are some vegetables cooler than other
In a week I have my first a level exam and I'm panicking so much internally but on the outside I look cool as a cucumber
Things will get better if u think they will. Negative attitude = negative outcome. Remember that it will b all ok
I want everyone to b happy and I understand that this is not possible always so I want U to know that I am here for u
I believe that is U  
Thank u
Can someone on Twitter on a desktop Dm me a screenshot of my account I need to check something

Remember when three Twitter accounts dedicated to @christianovelli's fish Hudson all fought over my love I'm laughing
In other news 
I hate the Internet people just yell at each other for no reason
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery again- you directed it at me. There's no need for it.
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery so why direct it at me? You're ranting at me about something I wasn't even doing
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery oh my god I'm not bitter are you even listening to me I was just telling Emma why people were saying shit
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery you're saying "you" but not at one point have i expressed my opinion. I stated what I've observed.
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery please don't make an argument out of nothing.
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery I know I'm not saying that??? Ur acting like I'm attacking her I'm literally just saying why people R annoyed
@animenovelli I'm fine ppl are just ridiculous
I wasn't even being hateful and I still have people arguing w me in my mentions
@sadradlarryaf @emmablackery I never said it was easy ??? But she does have it lucky compared to others. I'm not hating on her
@Outlaw_Monkey ????? I'm not saying you have to compare I'm literally just stating why there's shit going down
@emmablackery youre* that annoyed me sorry
@emmablackery while that may be true I think people were trying to say that there are harder jobs!! Like that your lucky in some ways
@emmablackery woah I'm not hating or anything I'm just saying, you were talking about how people don't appreciate how hard U work etc and
She needs to accept the fact her job is one of the easiest out there it may be hard for her I don't dispute that but she's lucky
@Beckiiofficial yes OMG don't get me started on those ppl
@GhostlyFoxGirl tell me again how your job is hard when my dad had a risk of being blown up every night an got paid half of what you get.
Ok but there are some youtubers that get paid more than my dad did when he lived in a tent in an Afghan army base for six years.
Quick watch this 
@christianovelli Doing this as we speak
@trxshfairy its ridiculous ppl are getting mad over something that actually helps others
Yes, UKIP are great 
@desolationhoe its a type of therapy

Ok so dodie made an asmr video ????????? That actually helps a lot of people ?????? Just because U don't like it doesn't mean it's wrong
@christianovelli but it doesn't rain inside!!!!!!! Haha!!!!!!!! What's up with that!!!!!!!! I am so alone
What has dodie done
@GhostlyFoxGirl I still can't believe
I actually blacked out for a moment just now that hasn't happened in months
â€œThe only sound I can hear is the sound of my own breath against my pillow, the shallow inhale and exhale of â€¦ 
Just how I'm feeling. @ 
Ahh things aren't great so I'm gonna go
Look after yourself
Why do I care so much about everything I would give anything to just not care about anyone or anything for a day
If u follow my private can u go over there a sec thank u
Tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
Fuckfuckfuck
We have a bank holiday tomorrow and that is the source of my happiness right now
Unfollowing me won't make blackers shut up about her career

@jetpackblews son
@walkingonrivers love u
I'm gonna hold your hand so tight I'm gonna break my wrist
21 weeks clean

My whole arm esp. My wrist is bruised and I have loads of like weird marks on it I have no idea what's happening
Mitch welling is such a dick how dare he make such good music

Back off bekahs mine  

Blue October are good people
Ok but youtubers complain about how hard their jobs are and that might be true but 98% of people have it harder.
Parent: we brought U into this world!!!
Ok great but maybe work on making me feel like U want me here
Why do ppl think it's ok to treat their kids like shit because they "brought them into the world" like yes YOU did so look after them.
Nvm I got screamed at the moment I went downstairs let's not have lunch today

I always freak myself out about the future I don't think I should ever be allowed to be an adult
I'm losing motivation so I'm gonna save it by listening to uptown funk

There r nicer people than me !!!!!!!!! Always !!!! I just like 2 help 
And before someone makes a smartass  comment about me being on Twitter Ive spent the whole weekend so far working and im taking a break
@ghiblicats she is still a baby in my eyes
Exams may b an unfair measure of intelligence but u can do ur best to showcase what u can do if u work hard !!! I'm cheering U on buddy
U might enjoy being on Twitter all day now but when it comes to ur exams U will b kicking urself for not doing work in this time!!!!
The "I'll do it later" attitude will not get U the results U want and deserve !!!! Even revising a single topic can go a long way
If u have exams soon take half an hour revising a topic ur struggling with!!! 30 mins could be enough to change the outcome of an exam !!!!
Yo!!! If u have revision to do and ur putting it off, don't !!! The sooner U do it, the sooner the stress to do it will reduce !!!!
Sometimes I remember when I was barrier for decade, divided by Friday, man overboard and mayday parade and I get RLLY happy

#RoyalBaby was born on the anniversary of the battle of hogwarts and if that isn't so completely british i dont know what is
GIMME GIMME GIMME SOME OF THAT VAMPIRE MONEY C'MON
I've done so much revision today
u should watch my videos i took time off revision to do those for u
I'm such a loser
If the child when she's older decides she doesn't want to wear pink or that shes in fact not cisgender then that's okay, but she's a newborn
Just because pink is attached to the supposed "female" image doesn't mean girls can't wear it. Let them be
A baby can't make the decision to choose colours it wants to wear so they chose a colour associated with their biological sex. Get over it
The royal family dressing their daughter in pink isnt transphobic or forcing gender roles they are literally just putting their kid in pink
@GhostlyFoxGirl @AlexAllTimeLow :)

@truedunknown don't take it as an attack on you, I'm just saying that your opinion can b seen as damaging
@truedunknown that's not what I'm saying? You're saying we shouldn't be taught about mental health and that's wrong
.@truedunknown R somehow freakish or messed up when in fact there R ways to support them. Mental health is important to talk about
.@truedunknown genuinely damaging. If people get ill and don't know about MH it can cause them to become isolated in fear that they -
.@truedunknown this is so damaging. I agree w UR point about glamourising MH because that's 100% wrong, but not learning about it can be -

Tips for managing exam stress P5:
Lastly, remember that good exam results aren't the only thing that matters. Your health is more important.
Tips for managing exam stress P4:
Don't leave it all to last minute. Cramming the morning of or the night before won't help you. Plan ahead
Tips for managing exam stress P3:
The best way to revise is past papers. Know what you're up against. Know when to ask for help also
Tips for managing exam stress P2:
Don't work in solid hour blocks. You'll take in more if you take it easy. Allot time for leisure
Tips for managing exam stress P1:
It's inefficient to stay up all night revising, you need your sleep
Give yourself breaks
Make sure to eat

The blurryface theories R making my head hurt can tÃ¸p just put us out of our misery

@AlexAllTimeLow I love you
Reminder that Alex has anxiety and the fact Ur all attacking him over a misinterpretation is horrible and U should stop
@AlexAllTimeLow alex just ignore all the negative responses. We know what you're saying and agree 100%, some people r just misinterpreting <TWO HEARTS>
The statement sounds racist bc of the connotations attached to it but alex wasn't using it in that way. That's not his fault
When Alex said all lives matter he wasn't saying it to dehumanise the struggles of ethnic groups. He was just stating that ALL lives matter
@lRLJOKE OH MY GODPLEASE
Maybe he's coming across wrong but his points R valid and he has his heart in the right place
Guys @AlexAllTimeLow isn't trash. Or racist. He's literally just saying that the destructive and violent protests need to stop

Beyond proud!!!! <TWO HEARTS> 
Whether you're a year or an hour clean it's incredible that you're trying so hard and I want you to know we are all supporting you
Hating on people isn't cool. No one is laughing with you, they're laughing at how pathetic you are. Learn a little human decency
Can we just pretend that today never happened 
I hope everyone had a good day today !
@GhostlyFoxGirl bringing this back
@allopalIo me too I am so mad she is my angel I don't want anyone hurting her
@GhostlyFoxGirl please do this. There are thousands of you  sending a tweet could make her day.
Do me a favour, and send @.ghiblicats some love. Just tell her it's gonna be okay. She really needs it right now
Leave Bekah alone. You're a fucking disgusting human being if you think attacking a 15 year old is a good way to spend your time.
One more lesson I can do this
I'm in a free now but I'm too tired to do any work so I'm just sat here playing Tetris wow I'm cool
Got an A in my psychology unit 2 mock :-)
Two lessons down two more to go <THUMBS UP SIGN>
School time ugh
Ten more days of school before study leave I can do this
Mum is still talking to my bros childminder and my sis and I are in the car screaming for her to hurry up. Wow family love
When you're sad remember that these losers exist 
I have been eating this one mint for like twenty minutes what the
Be good to yourself today!! There is only one of you in the whole world which makes you precious, so act that way alright ? <TWO HEARTS>
I just started laughing my ass off because I was called a slut yesterday and iM a virgin
School today is not the one thanks
@TurnaboutAdam better thank u!!
I hope everyone is feeling good or at least better compared to yesterday !!!
@walkingonrivers thnx so much !!
HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY !!
Goooood morning
I have to get up at 6am why am I like this
(Also Bekah is alright she is going to sleep)
Ok I have a long day tomorrow so I'm gonna go to sleep now. Look after yourselves alright? Good night <TWO HEARTS>
@GhostlyFoxGirl do it now please
Could you all send @/ghiblicats something nice?? They're v down about the hate they've been getting and they need some love. Thank you <TWO HEARTS>
Look after yourself. Imagine if a friend wanted to hurt themselves. You'd be devastated right? That's how people feel about you.
Don't hurt yourself. It doesn't help you, it just gives you one more thing to be upset about. Self care is how you feel better. Please
Reminder: 
I want everyone to be happy always and I know that's not possible and sometimes happiness seems so far away but I promise it will be okay <TWO HEARTS>
11:11 Bekah happy always
I think the hate I got today isn't even the most I've gotten before maybe that's why I'm numb to it
@ghiblicats please ignore it. I love you sosososo much. Ppl r dumb
@Louweeeasley thnx so much <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@ghiblicats  will hit them
BUT RT this for 3 free follows mbf
Anyway I'm about to go to sleep I think bc exhausted
I don't care if you send me hate but send Bekah or anyone I love hate and it won't be pretty :))))))
@MattW11111888 @ghiblicats an adorable teletubbie though
@frankspikachu thnx so much <BLUE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@frankspikachu he's not worth my time my dad was in the military so I know the info but tbh he's pathetic and I can't be bothered w it
The shitstorm tonight has made me hungry
@frankspikachu he's a dumbass I'm not gonna waste another second on him man. Thank u so much for helping <BLUE HEART>
@frankspikachu he doesn't mean it so I could care less. Man ppl R dumb sorry if he's been harassing U
I've said it before and I will say it again and again until people get a fucking clue. Spending your time hating on others is pathetic.
Feminism isn't ugly and neither are feminists. Feminism = equal rights. 
For EVERYONE. 
There is nothing ugly about that.
@gallifreyish tysm !!!
#FeministsAreUgly and yet here we are 
@PASTAPILOTS IM SORRY IM ANGRY
@_starrypie lili

My on point eyeliner says otherwise.

And legs. Solid long legs. Ideal for activities.
@lllsmy ahh it's not about being pretty!!! No one is ugly so it's just telling ppl to fuck off basically
@GhostlyFoxGirl #FeministsAreUgly
Hello lets do a little experiment. 
Ok if you're gonna say something negative get out of my mentions.
@CookieLivcat TRUE
@natalie2momma well men's rights are part of feminism ? The hashtag is for males females and non binary so
It's so sad how the slightest bit of self confidence is trampled on by the masses.

the above statement is false. look at me. 
People who don't want equality for men and women, socially, politically and humanely. 
#Feâ€¦
Bekah nearly has 4.5k she is too famous for me
@natalie2momma @ghiblicats feminism is equality for all sweetie, research before attacking people.
@MrHDRaw bye :)
@officialccbvb IM LAUGHING
Cute x 
@KingKJay this joke is about half an hour late sorry
Here is my contribution thank u for ur time 
@MarekSaidHi exactly!!! Ppl r so dumb man
@yung__ryan I'm not trying to prove anything. I don't need to, no one is ugly it's just people being nasty
@yung__ryan yes you can. I'm sorry I'm really not in the mood to argue.
Ppl bitching @ me having my hand in front of my face: I'm doing it for your safety. Don't want u to have a heart attack seeing how hot I am.
Aw it's so cute when ppl are in denial :-)  
Thank you to all of you. I'd respond to all of u but it would take so long. Thank you for sticking up for me x
As someone w mental health problems incl. body dysmorphia the fact I am trying to be self confident shouldn't incite hatred :-)
I'm blocking anyone and everyone who sends me something nasty now I am so done
Ok I'm so fucking done with these idiots
@RiceChewinAsian @Thebestswift13 @wildestphan telling me to kill myself and calling me ugly is.
And you're one of them.  
Do not start with me I have had enough of this tonight  
I don't care if you care but you shouldn't be hurting others for your own amusement.  
Why do we need feminism you ask? Teen girl tries to be confident and gets this response. 
Most people are decent and don't feel the need to deliberately hurt others.  
@RiceChewinAsian @Thebestswift13 @wildestphan is important to me and my recovery so you calling me ugly is damaging. Get out of my mentions
@RiceChewinAsian @Thebestswift13 @wildestphan honey I have a psychiatrist and I have major body image issues so me trying to be confident
@McSkops @wildestphan @RiceChewinAsian why are you still tweeting me? You're wasting your time and mine.
@McSkops @wildestphan @RiceChewinAsian  um they would defend me because they care about me and want me to know I have support?
Jokes already been made sweetie, be more original x 
@RiceChewinAsian I'm sure they do, but you shouldn't be randomly starting shit with teenagers on the Internet. Just leave it now, okay?
@McSkops @wildestphan @RiceChewinAsian they're defending me because they're my friends. I haven't asked them to. You should stop now.
@RiceChewinAsian um no one would say that IRL because people aren't nasty when they can't hide their faces
@McSkops @wildestphan @RiceChewinAsian read the tweet. If I WASNT confident it could hurt me. Luckily, I could care less
@MNash194 @ierohub @lRLJOKE so why call me a slut? Give me a reason then. Because you don't even know me.
@RiceChewinAsian you called me ugly lmao I think that is an attack you didn't have to say anything at all
Filters to make spots less obvious and I'm not covering my face I'm holding a phone or making a peace sign.  
.@allnamestakenff it's not playing the victim im literally just responding to tweets I'm not sobbing my heart out.
Do me a favour and report anyone Who has said something disgusting to me or anyone in the #FeministsAreUgly tag. We deserve better.
@RiceChewinAsian @wildestphan it's called cyberbullying, some people are damaged by it.
@RiceChewinAsian you wouldn't stop if I told you too so what's the point? Might as well let u get all this hatred out your system.
It's not vanity I'm not self obsessed I just said I'm pretty because I feel pretty and that's nothing to do w u  
@LO_Chisanna it's not literal. It was challenging the idea that feminists are ugly.
@RiceChewinAsian @wildestphan you can see my face I'm holding up a peace sign not a paper bag honey
I find it funny that saying I'm pretty means I'm a slut, that I should kill myself, that I deserve hate. Self confidence is a bitch x
Its called self-confidence
@wildestphan @RiceChewinAsian opinions deliberately attacking or hurting others shouldn't be spread. They shouldn't have even tweeted me
@tttygrayv thank u sweetie
@GhostieNovelli tysm <PURPLE HEART>
@LO_Chisanna ah okay it's just what I do in all selfies noting shy about it !
Honey you've been harassing me all this time, you're just lucky I really don't care about your ignorance  
@LO_Chisanna I can't tell if this is meant to b insulting bc that is all my mentions are rn
And showing a bit of skin...
Did you know that if I killed myself you would be fined and taken to court? :-)  
there are people so sad and full of hatred they have to attack those who show even the slightest happiness. Pity the bastards
Don't you fucking dare tell anyone to kill themselves. That's crossing a line.  
@ghiblicats my girlfriend
Angry misogynists hating that I don't care what they think. Bless them, it must be hard being a sad ball of hatred <TWO HEARTS> 
It's so cute that you have so much self confidence especially when you told me that's ugly. What does that make you? 
Apparently it's ugly to have self confidence? I say it's ugly to think you have a say in my self image.
Self confidence isn't ugly. 
And calling me ugly is attacking me so um?? Honey you're not doing too well 
Oh honey it's so cute that u care so much about a teen girls self image. Really <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
.@MNash194 I don't care. You call a girl a slut for having self confidence and anything you say is invalidated.
1) I'm beautiful 
2) face is visible
3) you're attacking a teen girl online, I think you're the irrelevant one here 
So I post pics of myself and get called a slut and that it doesn't count because I'm covering my face. 1) you can see my face 2) UR an idiot
Don't see how it matters since 1) you can see my face and 2) I know I'm beautiful I don't need ur validation :)  
A slut? Just because you know I'm out of your league and owning it <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
@doddleoddle my first a level exam is 11th may !!
#FeministsAreUgly ok so how do u explain me then 
I want that guy to reply I'm in the mood to fight a fuckboy

I feel very pretty today. Nice !
I love everyone and everything
My dad is so annoying smh someone adopt me
I'm gonna brush my hair and sing sad songs to my dog good bye
Do people actually get money for doing well in exams
I am very much a believer in karma. If someone is cruel to U, don't be cruel back. Someday they will regret it.
If ur reading this UR alive right now how cool is that !!!!!!! Gotta keep going man. Keep doing U
Things I want to be:
rich
not poor
all time low R the kind of band whose music literally suits every mood
Tip: you don't owe anyone anything. If ur friend is toxic to be around, don't just let it slide. U deserve to b surrounded by good people
My stomach just made a noise like a wounded animal
What I hate about year 12 is that we have to come back from study leave after our exams unlike in year 11 when we just stayed off
If you're stressed about exams and know that no matter what you probably won't revise until last minute clap your hands
Isn't this that band with Brendon urinal? 
I blinked and suddenly it's almost six pm
Danielle and Vic are so cute I'm gone
No I'm not crying I just have a bit of THEYVE GROWN UP SO FAST IM THROWING UP BLOOD in my eye 
Also can we talk about the fact my bed is way too big for me bc I curl up in a ball someone come here and join me now
Someone could be thinking about u right now and U wouldn't even know
Myidol is the funniest app I have ever seen
I think I just broke my spine trying to reach across my room to get my headphones from my bed

I'm such a lil kid I love long naps and Cartoon Network and smiley shaped potatoes
I just had the best nap
I need to lie down I'm thinking too much
I'm such a loser I think about this all the time
Our world is so incredible as the number of things we do know increases we are no closer to understanding
But do u ever just think like. We are so ignorant to what's out there. We know next to nothing about our planet there is so much to know
I am so fascinated by the Earth I want to know everything about it and the fact that that's impossible makes me want it more
*climbs through ur window at 4am* *shakes U awake* do u ever think about how the mind works how do we have a stream of consciousness how inc

Basically I'm doing a chemistry past paper and hold on till may came on shuffle and I started crying so hard I smudged my work. Lame
there is no such thing as "real music"
all music is good music
just because you yourself don't like it doesn't mean it's invalidated.
@buIletsera YES
Feelings towards exams in two weeks:

I'm gonna have a shower and watch WILTU? good night pals
@sugglerino @Youtuberinos point things out in public and that's not ok !!
@sugglerino @Youtuberinos ah yes but the post is talking about pointing it out. Talking privately is great but from experience ppl like to
I feel like a lot of ppl say it but I am always here. Honestly. I don't want anyone to ever feel like they can't talk to someone.
@sugglerino @Youtuberinos it's about having tact
@sugglerino @Youtuberinos if you're worried about someone's wellbeing you won't announce "hey are those scars?" You'd do it privately
+ out there who wouldn't want to be in a world that you aren't in. If you can't hold on for yourself, hold on for them.

@_starrypie Bekah my chipotle
Toxic people r people who make u unhappy. People who degrade u or make u feel worth less than U are. Those people do not deserve U
Get rid of the toxic people. This year I decided to only be friends w people who make me happy. It was the best decision of my life
Be a good person. Look at yourself and think, would I wanna be friends with me? Make people wanna b around u all the time

@sharpestilves and that the visuo-spatial sketch pad and the phonological loop are slave systems to the central executive
@sharpestilves the simplest way is to simply state what everything is. say that the central executive is the control system of the memory+
