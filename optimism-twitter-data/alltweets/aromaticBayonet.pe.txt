@TheRedofRobins "It honestly feels like I'm ripping off my face, birdie. Do you hate me that much for me to feel that pain?"
@TheRedofRobins "that's only because you didn't have a direct look, birdie." she sighs out and slowly moves her way towards the red robin
@aromaticBayonet -- room. jumping into a teleporter.. going who knows where, all we know is off this earth
[We are going to die...!] "Don't give up yet! We maybe the last here but we can do it!" She rushed towards the Castle, rushing in twilights-
soon that earth began to shake as if it was being torn apart "Oh no! It's going to go boom!"
@TheRedofRobins Yes and I absolutely hate it, it's hideous.
The last Pinkamena twirled around in her burned down world, it didn't make it.. she's all alone.. "Looks like we lost, Diane!" [I know...]
@ElementVendetta &gt; Her body slowly morphs into a cupcake.. no wonder she smells like it.. AND NOW THE THIRD EARTH &lt;
@ElementVendetta -- creepy thing was.. her eyes are close and a wide smile is glued on her face &lt;
@ElementVendetta &gt; Her body soon feel to its knees with blood gushing from both head and body. The limb body falls to its side but the --
@ElementVendetta &gt; She gasps after feeling the pain, managing to ask a question &lt; Who... was it..?
@ElementVendetta &gt; She KNEW she was being stalked but chooses to ignore the warning signs. She travels deep into the woods &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- end her tears early
@Bonnibel_Peebs it hurts to cry.. &gt; It actually did, a sharp pain rushes through her own body.. covering her own mouth as she attempts to--
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She couldn't hold it back even with her mask on, the dysfunctional woman began to sob on the queen's shoulder &lt;
&gt; The pink woman sat on the green fields, trying not to let her emotions get to her.. she honestly hates that plant woman &lt;
@TheRedofRobins I know that, silly. 
&gt; She quickly grabs the mask to become the much more appealing Diane &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Are you hiding something other then your identity? Is it one of those nasty pimples? &gt; She asked as if she was joking &lt;
@FeminineRobin -- female &lt;
@FeminineRobin I shouldn't be putting this stuff on you plus it's along story. Sorry about all of this. &gt; She sighed towards the younger --
@Bonnibel_Peebs It hurts.. it hurts..
@Bonnibel_Peebs But it hurts so much..
@TheRedofRobins Oh I'm aware, a friend of mine made it for me.. you can try it on if you like, birdie. &gt; She turns to him with a smile &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I... &gt; She stared for hours it felt like, is she angry? Upset? Depressed? What mood is she? Who knows &lt;
@Jack_Fire69 &gt; She is use to things like this, though she blinks twice. Her INCREDIBLY long hair meets her own feet and hug the ground &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I don't feel alright, not even close. I just wasted my time.. I couldn't tell him what I felt though I thought it.
@Jack_Fire69 &gt; She quirked a brow as she crossed her arms &lt; Jack Fire? I guess I'm Diane.
@Bonnibel_Peebs I don't understand my feelings but I feel like everything is alright with him but I wasted my time and felt.. scared.
@Jack_Fire69 &gt; She stared at the other with a blank, emotionless glare as she asks &lt; And, who are you?
@Bonnibel_Peebs Well.. I'm terribly sorry that I upset you, I'm not the element of laughter.. not even close.. I hate that I upset you..
@Jack_Fire69 // sigh //

&gt; The pink woman made her way around this area with a groan &lt; 
Maybe I should just leave.
@Jack_Fire69 // sure, why not.
@Bonnibel_Peebs Then a hopeless romantic, nothing ever happens to me. One question, what do you hate of me?
@Bonnibel_Peebs I don't want to seem like a bother.. &gt; She had no reaction towards Bonnibels actions &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- once again but sorrow filled her blue eyes this time &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs There wouldn't be a happily ever after with me and him as well.. although he doesn't know the REAL me.. &gt; She held herself--
@Bonnibel_Peebs I can handle the emotions since it's hard for me to actually feel them... I guess I could look around Ooo to find something.
@Bonnibel_Peebs Bonnibel.. should I stay or leave? I only came here with the lantern but now.. well.. you know..
@Bonnibel_Peebs I guess so..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- returns to her NUMB self &lt; ...
@Bonnibel_Peebs That was only once.. and I did promise him.. &gt; she picked up the mask as she sighs deeply, placing on her face as she --
@Bonnibel_Peebs maybe I should put my mask back on.. so I could feel numb when he goes for that plant thing..
@TheRedofRobins Hold this, birdie. &gt; Her voice is MUCH smoother now and slightly lower than before, she searched the tank &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Bonnibel.. &gt; The creature nuzzles into the queen as she becomes slightly larger &lt; I don't think the lantern liked me..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Is it the way I act..? I know I can change.. &gt; She slowly drifts back, closing her middle eye &lt;
@TheRedofRobins I'm not sure, &gt; She pulled off her mask showing something.. strange, she isn't human that's for sure &lt; it changes..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- to hear,she risked everything for this man &lt; Why do you hate me...? Am I not pretty enough..? smart enough..? what is it?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I was afraid of this.. I knew I should of stayed in the bottom of that ocean.. &gt; She stood and stared, it was hard for her -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- the best because love hurts me but I was risking my well being because I loved.. no.. love you.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- understand if you want that plant woman more but it doesn't mean i won't get jealous. I will, I know I haven't been --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- the REAL me was being stabbed yet I still looked for you in this stupid Kingdom.. &gt; She floated closer to him &lt; But I --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Now listen.. please.. hear me out.. with my mask on it hurt to be around you.. every moment we spend together it felt like--
@Bonnibel_Peebs So.. do you think of me as a monster..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I guess you can say that, listen.. I'm sorry for feeling so numb with my mask on.. &gt; She floated closer to him &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- Diane.. her voice is smoother &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She quickly shook off the water causing her short fur to stick up slightly &lt; Hello... John.. &gt; She DOES NOT sound like --
@Bonnibel_Peebs Sometimes it is, Bonnibel.. that's your name.. right?
&gt; The creature slides on the ground, soaked In water towards @TheAnt1_Chr1st, what was this thing..? &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Respect..? he could of just told me that.. I'll give him that.. even show him my actual body..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- herself together &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs But what if he wants something more then a broken mind? &gt; She sighed once more but soon slapped herself, trying to get --
@aromaticBayonet -- notice... &gt; She spoke as she sunk to the bottom and soon will be forgotten &lt;
nobody.. &gt; She floated near a deeper area, looking down at the water &lt; Would.. &gt; She quickly dipped her lower half in as her body froze &lt; -
No one will notice my disappearance... &gt; She slowly floated above the water, shaking with her own fear &lt; I can't move in water..
They wouldn't know my disappearance.. maybe I should just sink in the bottom of this ocean.. &gt; She floats towards OOO's Ocean, staring &lt;
I shouldn't be here.. I'm leaving this earth.. &gt; She looks around with her heart burning and her mind turning &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- loves another.. why does this happen..? why do others leave me for much more beautiful woman..?
@Bonnibel_Peebs You know.. what stings the most.. having so much to say but he slips away... it stings.. it hurts.. my vision tells me he--
&gt; The woman couldn't stand the screams anymore so she floated out of the candy Kingdom and onto the field &lt;
No.. don't leave.. &gt; She reaches out but it just caused more fear, they soon lock themselves in their stores and homes &lt;
&gt; She looks at the screaming, candy people as they ran, looking down at her claws &lt; I'm sorry.. I'm hideous, I know..
why can I..? I should tell him.. show him.. but he hates me.. &gt; She walks out of the candy like apartment causing the candy folks to run &lt;
I... I should of paid attention.. &gt; she began to sob more.. she's in great pain because of this mistake &lt; I bet he's moving on already..
&gt; She picks up a shard.. she soon began to sob at her reflection &lt; Why am I so idiotic...?
Is my disguise not enough..? Why does everyone leave me.. &gt; She looks back at the shattered mirror &lt;
I hate that he hates me and that plant freak.. why do everybody leave me for... beautiful woman..? &gt; She smashes the mirror with her tail &lt;
What is wrong with me..? &gt; The creature looked into the mirror, looking back at the monster she is &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; her two eyes close leaving the middle open as it forces on the queen, attempting to smile with her first lips &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I guess I'll never learn then.. &gt; She held herself but with her nails she slowly claws her skin under the short pink fur &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I don't know how to love... this... &gt; By this time all three eyes open, staring at the queen.. she really doesn't know &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs  -- still going to hide myself from these worlds.. they don't deserve to be scared..
@Bonnibel_Peebs The problem is.. I can't die, my deaths are like a sleeping pill.. they work but soon you still have to wake up.. and I'm --
@TheRedofRobins No, I'm calling you birdie, why you might be pondering Because it sounds cute and fits you.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- body in disguise &lt; no one knows my form besides the people who died for me.. The lantern.. the doctor.. no one..
@Bonnibel_Peebs But I hate the real me.. I'm terrified of myself.. &gt; She Shrank down to the queens size, she looks down at her floating--
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- getting tired of wearing that mask and you decide to poke me in the eye..? I told you I'm hideous.
@Bonnibel_Peebs OWCH. &gt; Her middle eye shuts as the other two open, staring at the queen.. she doesn't sound like the same person &lt; I'm --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- room, she seems to be laying down.. the creature has three eyes but the middle is the only one open, for now &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs But what I am, I'm hideous, right to the core. &gt; She manages to pull of his face/mask to reveal a creature that fills the--
@Bonnibel_Peebs You don't know what I am... &gt; She gripped onto both of her own ears as if she was going to pull a.. mask off? &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'm sorry... &gt; she slowly stepped backwards with her hand on her own face &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I tried.. I didn't know how to do it.. I'm weak and I lost him again.. he probably hates me now.. you probably hate me.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- a shaky sigh &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs But how can I do that..? I wear this mask to hide who I am.. I'm hideous.. &gt; A tear trickles down her face followed by --
@Bonnibel_Peebs But I try.. my mind gets so confused and my actions become numb to my needs.. please show me how to love..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- you and the doctor have been together for so long.. &gt; She gripped onto the taller woman's shoulders &lt; How do you find it?
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- too afraid to be near him because.. well.. I was afraid of fucking up, guess what gummy, I fucked up hard! Tell me, --
@Bonnibel_Peebs ... Why did you have to lay it so roughly? He wants to fuck that plant girl thing.. that's why he left! And because I was --
@Bonnibel_Peebs Gummy! I figured out why that lantern left me! &gt; She dashes the room with her neck stitched up &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Heh, you're good, bird boy.. I'm switching your nickname to birdie, it sounds nicer. &gt; She looks over at him with a smile &lt;
I hate you. &gt; Diane steps into the body as she caries on, she stops, pulling her bayonet out to see her named carved into it &lt; I hate you.
&gt; She walked around the streets, hating herself already, hell, she always did hate herself. She looks into her reflection in a puddle &lt;
@FeminineRobin Well, That man down there.. he made me into some.. monster, because of him I'm a murderer. You understand, right.. kiddo?
@FeminineRobin Now, if you did that.. if you brought me in.. it will chaos, I wouldn't cause it.. he would.. you can say he.. loves.. me.
@TheRedofRobins -- move.
@TheRedofRobins Oh? Really now? Do tell.. and this is him. &gt; She kept a hand on the tank, looking through it &lt; not so tough when he can't--
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She blinks. Diane didn't think the queen would do it. &lt; You hit hard. &gt; Both of her mouths speak.. one normal one high &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I know that.. &gt; she grabbed onto the queens hand to raise it towards her face &lt; Slap me.
@Bonnibel_Peebs Slap me! Talk to me... I don't know... &gt; Her scarf dropped revealing another mouth such as the mouth in the icon. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; God damn it Tegan, she feels for the blood that trickles down and onto her own lip &lt; I'm getting weak.. please help me..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- away, Diane's nose soon began to bleed &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She didn't want to touch the sugar scented queen anymore.. it was giving her a throbbing headache, gently pushing her --
@Bonnibel_Peebs Trick you...? [Believe me, I trick everyone with my mask on, queen.] Im serious.. I don't find myself attractive...
@Bonnibel_Peebs As I said before I can't do that, I'm hideous and I don't think others would like to see me like that..
@Bonnibel_Peebs Something sexy? But I'm hideous.. &gt; It sounded if two people were speaking at the same time &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Gummy... what do I do..? it's gotten harder to remain calm... &gt; She clings onto the queen by this point &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- both of them, wouldn't it make sense...?
@Bonnibel_Peebs You know.. &gt; She grip onto the gum like gown with a sigh.. obviously still hurting from last night &lt; Why don't you date --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- tears, she REALLY could of used this last night &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- also wearing a white LONG scarf as well.. to hide something maybe? She slid her arms to the queen almost breaking into --
@Bonnibel_Peebs So, you are..? You're scared of his anger.. which makes you scared of me..? &gt; What is this woman going on about? She's --
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; The pink woman knocks on the bedroom door, knowing the queen would be in it &lt; I'm sorry, Gummy.. do I scare you..?
&gt; She covers the second mouth with a scarf, she's even scared herself.. she could really use a friend but then again, she has none. &lt;
&gt; A tongue slides out of the other mouth as she looks at it.. disgusted at the slight part of the monster she has been hiding &lt; I hate you.
@aromaticBayonet -- rows of sharp teeth form on the wound, she speaks with the other mouth &lt; It's time.
&gt; She waits.. yet nothing shows, soon closing her eyes as she sliced open neck with a smile.. blood didn't come out.. a large mouth with --
@aromaticBayonet -- pocket with a wide smile &lt; Maybe if I have two mouths... heheh... &gt; She placed the blade to her neck &lt;
No one cares.. they're all the same.. they all hate me.. &gt; She stood up to look in the mirror once again, grabbing her scalpel from her --
@Bonnibel_Peebs // GOODNIGHT
Why doesn't anyone CARE? Why doesn't anyone HEAR me? &gt; She honestly needed someone.. she's breaking.. don't let her break.. &lt;
&gt; She shouted in the empty candy house as tears ran down her face, scratches covering her body &lt; HELP.... me..
@Bonnibel_Peebs // tHERE WAS A VINE
&gt; She wasn't angry.. she was alone and with no one by her side she hides her face in her knees and began to sob.. &lt; Help me..
@Bonnibel_Peebs // I cANT WATCH THAT, IT REMINDS ME OF SHREK
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Actually, that's true.  But when she awakens from the dream she begins a new nightmare.
@Bonnibel_Peebs // She even disappoints herself that's why she's grown a liking to dying all the time, it's the only time she feels peace
@Bonnibel_Peebs // She knows she disappoints everyone she meets
hell
she even disappoints me
@Bonnibel_Peebs // hUH? IM ONLY FEELing good because I just ate a whole bunch of sour candy.
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Huh. I don't know what to do Now, Diane needs a friend and I need a drink of water (is in a good mood) HUH.
&gt; She stared into the mirror with a broken mind and heart.. if she had one that is.. staring at the blood sliding from her nose &lt; Heh..
@Bonnibel_Peebs // sHE ISNT A SLUT OH MY GOD
plus I love be evil with my characters
AND 
I don't know who she'd fuck
@FeminineRobin Something.. horrible let's just say.. you might puke or run if I tell you the rest. &gt; She sighed, crossing her arms &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs // HUH, I guess Diane is single, AGAIN. Time to fuck shit up-- wait.. we should wait and let her calm the fuck down.
@FeminineRobin Not on earth, kiddo and.. I WAS with a lantern but things.. fell apart, oh well.
@Bonnibel_Peebs // It actually doesn't anger her, she KNOWS she going to be single soon so why throw away /paw/ible friends?
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- won't do it if she feels nothing.
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Diane is weird, she has to get jealous of someone flirting with John just enough to want to get back. She literally --
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Hm.. First we need to get Diane jealous so she'll help flirt but how...?
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Hm.. let Diane get to know this robin first or as she calls him.. "Bird boy" and I ALWAYS follow back on this account.
@Bonnibel_Peebs // actually 
@TheRedofRobins I love to mess with everyone, like.. little game.. childish games..
@aromaticBayonet -- is just worried.. asking herself &lt; Why don't anyone flirt with me? Am I too scary?
&gt; She sighs, thinking about both the OLD doctor and her own boyfriend.. honestly she did miss the jerk but oh well and her boyfriend? She --
&gt; She rested near a hotel, wondering why everyone must tease him.. she honestly hates it but would she speak up, no. &lt;
@TheRedofRobins But if I did I wouldn't get to see you look so.. surprised, bird boy. &gt; She walked towards the tank, knocking on it &lt;
&gt; Having a room full of men staring she couldn't stand it.. hours after she was down with her shower she comes out soaked in blood &lt; Men..
@aromaticBayonet -- hates being watched.. slipping out of her sports bra and pink undies before heading towards the showers &lt;
@aromaticBayonet -- the change rooms to slip out of sweater and shorts, starting at the men in the room, being a mixed bathroom.. fuck she--
&gt; She walks over to the public showers with a sigh, whispering to herself "I need to get a house.. I have the money for one.." walking into-
@TheRedofRobins -- with a large tank with a man in it.. floating near the middle with his eyes closed &lt;
@TheRedofRobins &gt; She grabbed onto the taller "hero" as she warns him to remain calm, after two seconds they seem to be a well lit room --
@aromaticBayonet -- in the bartenders hand before walking away, still sober &lt;
&gt; Finishing off the last of the liquor as the others began to whisper, the bartender couldn't say anything as she places a medium Diamond --
@TheRedofRobins -- going on about? Maybe this woman does have some use after all.. &lt;
@TheRedofRobins That means a lot of fighting and blood will be shed, I hope you know in seven different timelines you'll die. &gt; What is she-
&gt; She slams her 25th hit down, staring at the surprised bartender, others began to walk over as she chugs her 26th shot &lt;
@TheRedofRobins The catch is, that he won't die, you can only hold him captive for so long before he gets out.
@TheRedofRobins I got him in a tank right now but... he'll escape any minute right now.. he isn't too found of water or cold weather...
@TheRedofRobins Who? Me? I don't see anything special but if you want.. I won't fight it. 
&gt; Music plays, Diane has joined the team! &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'm sorry about before.. it's hard controlling Zalgo at times.. &gt; She held the queen ever so close.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Everything is going to be alright.. &gt; She spoke softly as she rubbed the back of the queens back with a sigh &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs .... &gt; She slowly walked closer, wincing every step she took as she pulled the queen in for a gentle embrace &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Would you like me to continue or are you satisfied with this new knowledge?
@FeminineRobin I'm with a Lantern, and I try to be.. well.. I'll tell you something.. I'm on the most wanted list, can you keep that secret?
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- is nothing wrong with anyone besides myself. &gt; She hasn't blinked for awhile and her eyes are pitch black &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'm just someone with mental problems and don't know how to deal with them, I'm known as the element of (s)laughter. There--
@FeminineRobin hm.. I was planning to keep you, why? because you're a cute kid. &gt; She ruffles Robin's hair with a slight and forced smile &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- at the queen with not anything hatred just.. tiredness &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- the facts and story is unclear. I know my original is a pink earth pony that has some bipolar issues. &gt; She kept staring-
@Bonnibel_Peebs But you are, in every world there is a copy of you. You could just be a copy of another or you could be the original. --
@Jack_Fire69 And stick your tongue up your ass..
@FeminineRobin Just Robin, Huh? Fine.. I'm giving you a nickname.. Birdie. Say, do you have any place to stay?
@Jack_Fire69 I would probably cut your tongue off..~
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She sat up staring at the queen, slowly slides off the table and whispers softly &lt; All you normals are the same.
@TheRedofRobins What do you mean "if"? &gt; She quirked a brow towards him &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; the pink woman soon shot her eyes open, darting her eyes around.. feeling the straps &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- backwards, hitting her head on a bar seat causing the woman to be knocked out &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs You want to hear me scream in pain.. don't you? you would love that.. they would all love to hear that.. &gt; She tumbles --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- heart, blood exciting from her mouth as well &lt; You would love to see me suffer even more.. wouldn't you?
@Bonnibel_Peebs now, I would have to die.. wouldn't i? But you would like that.. wouldn't you.. &gt; She staggers backwards due to her missing-
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- crazy shit.. but it's funny.. how you humans and candy people.. well, everyone plays by the same rules..
@Bonnibel_Peebs Listen here.. queenie, hundreds of years of being left.. having my children die AND the depression could make you do some--
@Bonnibel_Peebs **heart
-- with a wide grin, squeezing it until it get ripped apart by her own fingers.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs You have no idea how many times this heart has been shattered by o-others.. &gt; She feels her own heard between her fingers --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- enough wound for her arm to slide in.. pulling on her heart until pulling it out.. it somehow still bumps.. &lt; See..~?
@Bonnibel_Peebs The thing is.. I don't want it.. do you want it.. friend? &gt; She had jammed the dagger into her own body, making a big --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- forward as she pulled an Iron dagger from her Silk  pink hair &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I don't need to impress anyone now.. I don't even need my stitched half heart.. wanna see it.. friend? &gt; She slowly steps --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- have a "knight", darling.
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She tilted her head, letting her hair drop from her shoulders with a large smile, speaking towards the queen &lt; I don't--
@Bonnibel_Peebs Don't touch me.. &gt; SORRY, CRACKED SCREEN TRICKED ME, she backs away with a slight growl &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs don't touch me.. &gt; She backs away as if the queen was a stranger to her.. oh dear, this is the "cupcakes" nobody wants --
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'm not saying you're low.. I'm saying he's low, he'll break, everyone does.. &gt; It's obvious she is breaking as she speaks &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- them... they always hurt, kill and abandon me.. leave me to rot away.. heh..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- cheats. To think, I was going.. heh.. planning to throw him a party.. but no.. he makes me sick to my stomach.. both of -
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- for someone who'll crawl so low? even if he's changed.. I don't like it. someone who lies and cheats always lies and --
@Bonnibel_Peebs What? No. I feel dead for him now.. he literally got married to you while we were still dating so why would I have feelings-
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- say..? &gt; She wanted to bring up the part when the queen STOLE him from her but.. she let it go.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Then I'll make myself disappear without him disappearing.. this will be the last you see of me.. do you have anything to--
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She replied with a smile, with a hand resting on the queens shoulder &lt; The baby will continue with John, you'll be happy.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- insano will vanish and you'll be dating my John.. and what will happen to me? I don't know..
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'll stop my own mother from getting out of the fire.. I'll let us burn so Zalgo can't touch me.. with me out of the way --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- mean by "leave"? &lt; I won't be apart of your life because I wouldn't be there.
@Bonnibel_Peebs Then... I'll leave, everyone seems to smile more when I'm not around so.. what could go wrong? &gt; She shrugs.. what does she-
@Bonnibel_Peebs **RETHINK
@Bonnibel_Peebs You're starting to sound like me and I'm starting to sound like you.. please, Gummy.. let's just rethinking your plans.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- could go for a drink or six &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs That wouldn't be too logical.. &gt; she pulled away from the Hug.. it's dark under her eyes.. she really looks likes she --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- being attacked by powerful.. creatures.. if I had died in that fire and I wasn't saved.. nobody would have to suffer..
@Bonnibel_Peebs Pressure of you know.. the risk of proxies taking over the land of Ooo.. the longer I'm alive the more risks these planets--
@Bonnibel_Peebs But if I have died.. none of this would had happened.. you wouldn't have be put under this pressure..
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- and well.. everyone I meet.. they do hate me.. if I wasn't here.. if I died in that fire you would of been much happier..
@Bonnibel_Peebs It's not you.. trust me.. you're the only person who hasn't left my side yet.. Insano.. John.. Dylan.. the other elements..-
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- really out of it, what happened..? &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Everyone is leaving me, gummy.. it's just like before.. everyone Ḩ́͏̧A̧̕͢͝͠T̷͞͝É̵͘͜͠S̷͜͠͝ me.. &gt; Her hug tightens, she's --
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; the cupcake scented woman came up to the candy queen with tears in her eyes, hugging tightly onto the queen &lt;
&gt; She wanders the cold streets alone.. sobbing to herself as she asks &lt; Why can't I keep anyone interested in me..?
@aromaticBayonet -- streets of the kingdom. With all the rain that's happening lately isn't helping her mood &lt;
@aromaticBayonet -- she's been well, all the elements of Harmony to please everyone.. slowly walking away from the bar and into the cold, --
@aromaticBayonet -- knows that he's cheated.. she knows it all too well.. it's just like before.. she's been loyal.. she's been kind.. --
&gt; She's been listening in at the bar.. the half of her heart swells in depression.. it's just like before.. she can't do anything.. she --
@TheRedofRobins Then how could we work together, bird boy? &gt; She chuckled at his remark, she does have a slight point &lt;
@FeminineRobin Robin? C'mon give it to me.. I just saved you after all, kid. &gt; she got up and placed her hand on the masked female head &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Fine but what's your actual name, bird boy?
@FeminineRobin yes, for now at least now.. the name is Diane, and what's yours..? &gt; She looked over with her blue eyes really showing &lt;
@TheRedofRobins All of you are the same.. I swear, want to die? Fine. &gt; She let go of his ear with a low growl &lt;
@FeminineRobin I know him.. too well.. let's just say.. he's just trouble..
@FeminineRobin &gt; from above and the distance it looks like an odd man walking in smog.. no.. searching &lt;
@TheRedofRobins -- and reached up, pinching on the hero's ear to pull him down.. making cold hard eye contact &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Listen to me bird boy, get everyone at least out of this city and in hiding or off this planet. &gt; She goes on her toes --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- struggles to place him on the metal table in the middle of the room. She slips his clothes off and began to tie &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Ah.. that took shorter now.. it's time for the show to begin.. &gt; She grabs onto him as they seem to be in her dungeon, she -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; it taste of cupcakes and marshmallows, of course. She waited for the dizziness to kick in &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; doesn't take long, making sure he doesn't notice she slipped in a small surprised in his drink, sliding it over to him &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Yeah..! I'll make them. &gt; They seem to be inside a closed bar, she runs behind to mix up some drinks &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She knew how to knock someone out without much damage, she speaks up &lt; Want to grab a drink?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st there must be something I could do to help.. &gt; Speaking as she pulls her lips away from his skin &lt;
@TheRedofRobins -- on a street light pole with a sharp sigh &lt;
@TheRedofRobins All I need you to do it get everyone ready to leave this planet, if I tell them that they'll think I'm fibbing. &gt; She leans-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She pulled him down to kiss his cheek feeling the pain he's experiencing &lt;#
@TheRedofRobins He can easily control a whole planet in less then a week, I'm talking about larger planets. &gt; She shrugs with a sigh &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st The thing is.. I don't know as well.. &gt; She's just as upset as him, she's struggling to hide it away &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Why don't we get our mind off of last night and do something..? anything is up! we could bake, hang out.. talk.. anything..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She looks up at her knight in green with an attempt of a smile, trying to cheer him up &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- back, rubbing it &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; I know, you know, she knows he knows even the human who is reading this knows, her eyes soften as slides her hands to his-
@TheRedofRobins Confusing you? How, dear? I'm not here to hurt Gotham, only to warn it.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You should know by now that I'm full of surprises, darling.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm just trying to help, you know..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Quickly grabbing on his wrist to tie the balloon's string on him, since when did it have a string? Oh well. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She's trying her best to cheer him up.. soon pulling out a balloon from her hair to soon blow it up, it seems to float &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; That's pretty nasty shit, she looks up at him, quirking her brow &lt; Chicken?
@TheRedofRobins it's a number system and if I'm here the others won't come near, nifty, Huh? &gt; She crossed her arms as she spoke &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st he gets a kick out of death, the same with me... but.. let's not talk about it.. let's just get something to eat, alright?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Hey.. he's a small part of me.. so.. you don't want to see me again?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st If you say so.. so.. want to see him in the tank..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- slowly slipping into a hero &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st  but I haven't done anything to be proud of. &gt; Besides coming along way to a raged murderer to a once a month criminal, --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st you don't need to worry about Zal anymore for at least.. 100,000 years, love..he's in a tank full of water.. are you proud?
@TheRedofRobins but no worries dear, no harm will come to you.. yet. &gt; She moves closer until they touched &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st  &gt; hours later she hugged him from behind with a slight giggle.. she's done something, hasn't she? &lt; hero..
@TheRedofRobins Not exactly since every time I talk to someone new they usually die within the five minute or twenty minute mark, fun.
&gt; She was hoping to spend some time with a friend to get her past the fact that every time she has a child it dies &lt;
&gt; Diane rushed out and into the streets and feeling horrible that her child is gone.. oh well.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- speed it made her look like she had vanished in thin air.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Someone else of course, he'll get tired of getting blood on his hands and.. trust me.. I'm always aware. &gt; With her own --
@Bonnibel_Peebs He's lucky, that he gets to live out his life with you, The lantern will leave me again, again and again. Trust me.
@Bonnibel_Peebs Drive them away..? Heh.. If anything my insanity should of drove everyone away.. it always does.
@FeminineRobin The answer is simple, just some pink haired woman. &gt; She walks over to the edge.. looking down at the danger &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs yeah, well. thanks I guess.. &gt; The pink murderer stands up with a sigh, looking at the queen with sadden eyes. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- really don't need to..
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; Of course she couldn't help but to blush at being this close to someone AND being placed near her *AHEM* breasts &lt; You...-
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- to latch onto the queen &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Worry? About silly ol' me? don't be ridiculous, Gummy. &gt; It's a childish nickname but oh well, she snakes her arms around--
@Bonnibel_Peebs Emotionally of course.. &gt; She sat up, staring at the queen as her eyes return to her normal fish eyes &lt; Why do you fear me?
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; With a quick reaction she grabbed onto the queens hand before touching &lt; Don't, it'll sting.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- and kind hearted smile shows on her own lips &lt; you shouldn't be afraid, friend..
@Bonnibel_Peebs Wait.. &gt; She looks up at the queen with a quirked brow.. confused on why she was afraid of the cupcake *queen*. A gentle --
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She laid with a quirked brow, continuing to hold onto her stomach as blood leaks from her mouth &lt; What's that..?
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; Her hands are soaked in blood as well due to her opened stomach, slowly grabbing onto the queens hand.. she's shaking.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Its Zalgo.. he's being an ass.. I lost another child because of him and it isn't healing probably.. could you help..?
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; She appeared behind the queen with blood soaked on her clothes near her stomach area &lt; Hey, Gummy..
@TheRedofRobins You shouldn't be ashamed of it, you should be PROUD. &gt; She giggles towards him, flirty, isn't she? &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- toy? is this some kind of cruel joke? &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- with her screaming.. Diane's blood covers the lantern's hands.. some even cover his face.. this time bomb is.. only a --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; death is her only friend but her true friend is the hero, her lover is the hero. She didn't scream this time.. she's done-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- pain.. she kinda likes the pain.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st It's fine.. I'm use to dying by now.. &gt; She closed her eyes ready to meet her only friend, death once again and to meet her-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She grabs onto his shoulders.. shaking with her own fear.. tears falling from her eyes &lt; Cut it out of me..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Cut it out.. get it OUT of me.. if you let it go off I'll be gone.. &gt; Her heartbeat matches the bomb &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st wait... there's a bomb in me...? THERES A BOMB IN ME?? &gt; She soon began to panic, fuck &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Not when diet cola is around, throw him in the ocean and he wouldn't be coming back for YEARS. the ticking is quick &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; NO, she literally has something inside her. two things. a ticking time bomb and a child. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- he'll understand &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Yes just.. hungry.. that's all. &gt; Since when has she ever ate or been hungry? if he placed his hand on her stomach maybe --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- a bit larger.. could it really be..? &lt; --where, got it? &gt; She pulls him down &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st you're not going any-- &gt; A pain began in her stomach.. was it a late reaction..? could it be that.. well.. she has gotten--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st no, it's fine.. I'll just find a bar I could work at for the time being..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Hey, Uh.. sorry for not having any money for an hotel.. ever since I quit the SCC to travel with you I have no money..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Stop rolling everywhere.. &gt; She grabs onto him to pull him towards her, hugging him tightly &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; It's a bench, his head landed on her knees &lt; GAH.. damn it hero..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ... &gt; With a sigh she makes her way to him, but sits on the ground once more &lt; I don't want to get you sick or wet..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She looks over with a sigh, looking down at her quickly soaked body and denies &lt; No.. you'll get wet..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- only one laying giant she was forced to sit in the pouring weather, shivering.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She soon gets down from the roof as it began to ran, finding a bus stop and quickly placed John inside since it could --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- attempt to drag him off the building &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Hell no! There's a storm coming and she doesn't want to risk him getting sick again.. grabbing onto his shoulders to --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- going to pass out she got up and moved him the center &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st That robin guy, really? you shouldn't worry about them.. I only find room in my heart for you, darling. &gt; Knowing he was --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Jealous? You're jealous...? now why in the name of fuck would you need to be jealous of?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Is it work...? stress..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I've never seen you drunk in along time, you know. &gt; She cuddled into the drunken knight &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; soon joining John on the rooftops with a sigh, sitting beside him and spoke &lt; Drunk?
@aromaticBayonet -- "thanks" would of been nice.
@aromaticBayonet -- the necks of the criminals.. somehow lifting them up, hanging them as the other screams in fear, dashing away &lt; A --
&gt; After fifteen minutes of watching a beat down she finally approaches them with two balloons, knocking the two out and tying the strings--
&gt; Diane lean against the bar that John was in, sighing at his choice.. She saw a robbery in order but did she do anything? No. &lt;
@TheRedofRobins You see, dear, I have my reasons and you seem nice from behind..~ So why not? &gt; was she staring at his ass? Most likely &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Why did I come to you? Can a girl go out and attempt to make some "pals"?
@FeminineRobin You're going to ruin my rescue mission, kid. &gt; With one blink they appear on the rooftops, letting the female go &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Really now? I don't think you can... but never the less.. &gt; She soon became silent &lt;
@FeminineRobin &gt; The pink woman grunts softly but continues to drag, whispering to the masked female &lt; Stop moving for a second..
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Wait, wait. Are we talking about Diane and my love for the character?
@Bonnibel_Peebs // Eh?
@TheRedofRobins I'm not telling you anymore information.. &gt; She spoke softly, it's obvious she's embarrassed &lt;
@TheRedofRobins No, Zalgo. &gt; Her eyes widen, damn she isn't good at shutting herself up with information &lt; Shit, spilled it.
@TheRedofRobins You'll meet him within the month and I warn you, dear. Do the opposite of what he says or your soul... is his to keep.
@TheRedofRobins -- the "hero" &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Now, if I told you that, dear. I'll have to kill you, understand? &gt; She pulls her shirt down as the small woman approached--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Well, alright. I will but don't know what I could do.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Come on. &gt; She gently punches his arm with a giggle &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Heh.. I can see why.. why don't you give him a treat...? a kiss? I know he likes you. &gt; Damn it Diane &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st but.. well, if that's how YOU do it then, why not.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Chicken attack...? are you serious..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; wow, she's actually speechless for once. she is just straight up confused &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Not by them.. THEY were going to come if I stayed any longer.. &gt; She looks over.... staring at the level 5 stache &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [I was going to beheaded if you never shown... thank you..] &gt; She willing went with the knight-- officer in green &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- thrilled to see the man she loves but she didn't want to put him danger &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [John?] &gt; She couldn't risk talking out loud.. but.. she wonders &lt; [wouldn't you be a criminal if you do this...?] &gt; She --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her bright blue eye was staring right back.. growling could be heard from inside the room &lt; Let me out...
&gt; She paces around in her cell, screeching cusses, threats and much more, soon banging on her door &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; She quickly grabs onto the doctor.. with a blink of an eye they were on a hill.. &lt; you're going to love it..
@INSANOWILLRULE Fuck you, I'm doing it.. I never back out of a pinkie promise.
&gt; The pink woman was thrown into a cell after all these years, quickly standing and grabbing onto the bars &lt; Heh..
@INSANOWILLRULE -- &gt; She sprung up with a small smile curling on her face, she's still the same as ever. &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE Maybe I'll make you that dinner I promised but never got a chance to make.. you are feeling.. well.. skinny.. too skinny.. -
@INSANOWILLRULE -- the mad scientist with her fish like eyes, she's died recently, hasn't she? &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE I know how you are, believe me. I've known you for how many years? If you want me to back off I will. &gt; She looks up at --
@INSANOWILLRULE **she

-- and rest her head on his lap &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE AND you blame me for that? Is it because of the past..? I wasn't ME and I was drunk.. it.. it.. &gt; Shr fell to her knees --
@XEyeLessJackX I can make my own, I do run a bakery.
@INSANOWILLRULE -- contact with him &lt; And to be honest with you.. I was drunk that night, alright?
@INSANOWILLRULE Listen, I didn't do anything with gumgirl. Okay? &gt; quickly grabbing onto the doctor chair to spin it around to make eye --
@XEyeLessJackX &gt; The pink woman flicks his mask with a soft growl &lt; Asshat.
@INSANOWILLRULE "Cake slut"? Really..? I can't stand sweet you jackoff. &gt; She spoke up from behind, crossing her arms in the process &lt;
@XEyeLessJackX "Hang me up" like a picture frame...? how kind of you...
@Bonnibel_Peebs // shh.. I was passing out... SHH...
@Bonnibel_Peebs Who would want to see something like me? &gt; She asked as walked out the door, leaving a tray of cupcakes behind &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Probably not.. if I'm not around I'd probably be in jail. &gt; She slowly walks out of the bedroom.. she didn't want to leave &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Get some rest, got it? &gt; She wanted to cuddle with the queen but seeing the doctor.. memories flash in her head.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; finding the strength in herself to pick up the queen and place her on the empty bed, soon climbing on &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs You sure like hugs.. &gt; she spoke up, continuing her comforting the best she could &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // you can always talk to uncle booblord.
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- THERE? &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs I smell soft? &gt; She raised an eyebrow at the writer and the character, STOP BREAKING WALLS. CAN YOU AT LEAST PRETEND ITS --
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // *my reaction* 
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // I've heard of the drunk stories, trust me.
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; the writer says its fine~ in some causes she has pink skin &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // I've done many with the sleeping Drew.
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; PINK? More like pale skin that would even make Snow White jealous, soon rubbing her hand against the queens back &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // we can if you want, IM fine with them, Diane.. she gets nervous.
@Bonnibel_Peebs .. &gt; With a slight growl the smaller pink woman pulled the bubblegum queen in for another embrace &lt; Fine..
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // BuT MY PINK BABY ISNT GOOD 3ITH ORGIES
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // Isn't that everyone's first love?
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- the smaller pink woman a migraine.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Maybe it's because our skins are touching.. &gt; She mumbles just loud enough to hear, being around all this candy soon gave --
@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // they could all be happy gays together
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- had the bubblegum scent did her no favour yet Diane couldn't show it, a soft blush ascends to
her cheeks &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs &gt; Of course being the proxy she is she could hear the chewy heartbeat from a mile away, having the sugar loaded past she --
@XEyeLessJackX What~? It does Jackie~ Maybe we could do that~?

@Bonnibel_Peebs @INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st // ITS POSSIBLE
@Bonnibel_Peebs What would make you feel better? I know I can do only so much but I just can't stand any level of sadness..
@Bonnibel_Peebs You could say that. &gt; quickly letting the balloon go as it floats to the ceiling, what does she breathe out? helium? &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- pulled out a yellow balloon from her pocket, soon blowing it to show it had a excited expression &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs Because gumgirl, I can't stand the sense of depression and whatnot, it hurts me more than it hurts you. &gt; The woman had --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- circles under her eyes, the woman probably never heard of sleep.. &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs So the news has been getting around, huh? I should get back into hiding soon.. &gt; She looks over at the queen with dark --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- she's being studied at the moment &lt;
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- Listen, gumgirl. Whatever you're afraid of.. laugh it away, it can't hurt you. &gt; She sat next to the queen.. knowing--
@Bonnibel_Peebs I'm over that.. I've killed enough to forget about that doctor Because of my element I can't hate.. lucky you, right? --
@Bonnibel_Peebs -- kneel down, stroking the candy like hair &lt; You're really made out of gum, Huh..?

&gt; Somehow the murderer gotten into the Castle and into @Bonnibel_Peebs room to see the queen weeping &lt; So you're her, Huh..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st There is no reason to be jealous.. For, I have my heart settled with you, Jo--Joh...John. &gt; she sighs heavily &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her soft hand returns the grip with a small smile &lt; we're you jealous...? worried..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st What..? &gt; She simply followed him like a lost child, grabbing onto his hand &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You should go say sorry.. or not, it's your choice Hero..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st We're a train wreck, am I right or am I right? &gt; She giggles her sentence as she placed her lips on his cheek &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- his cheek &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm sorry I hissed at you.. I have terrible anger issues.. &gt; She's right, she does. Going on her toes to attempt to kiss --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- how to see love such as this, she wanted to make John understand.. that's half of it at least.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She didn't hesitate to run into a hug.. the small woman held the hero close.. this is what she wanted, rarity taught her -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her bangs cover the woman's eyes as the tears escape, having her arms crossed as she listens carefully.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- truly said another story.. she hates knowing that she is one of them.. she hates being a monster.. she feels pity &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st What is it lantern..? &gt; She couldn't see clearly anymore, her vision is flooded with her tears of anger but her voice.. --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- her voice cracks as she speaks.. holding onto her stomach &lt; you all act the same.. Zalgo was right..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You've been lying to me.. this whole time.. &gt; She stepped back with her eyes filled with blood like tears overfilling, --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She couldn't leave him.. soon coming back with her heart smashed &lt; So that's what you really feel about me..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st It's my element, John. I HAVE to.. put me in a cell after but for now.. &gt; She didn't say anything else.. she was gone.. &lt;
@TheRedofRobins -- them.
@TheRedofRobins -- rise. &gt; She walks into the light as she pulled up her shirt enough to show scars from her past deaths &lt; I can still feel-
@TheRedofRobins I would be blabbing but your loss on time, I can die but give me an hour or days.. weeks.. my slowest was a year and I'll --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I can do it for you, it'll be.. payback for cheating and all those people who had died.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Then why not now? Make his blood pour out, let him suffer. &gt; oh god, the "slaughter" is showing well.. &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Immortal? No, I can die if my head is far from my head for long enough and villain? I guess you can say that.

@TheRedofRobins -- mood tonight. So.. what are you supposed to be? &gt; The pink woman poked his shoulder but lightly.. playfully maybe? &lt;
@TheRedofRobins They are but pointing it to your head..? what are you, some proxy? I would of let you pull the trigger but.. I'm in a good--
@BloodyPinkiePie calm down, giggle at the ghosties, remember? &gt; The tracing soon became cutting &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie -- behind &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie Of course, you broke it too many times... now.. &gt; She traces the drooping knife along pinkies stomach leaving a red line --
@BloodyPinkiePie You know.. I'm not even going to let you have the special treatment, that's how angry I am with you..
@BloodyPinkiePie Two reasons Pinkie, one you used all of it and the second is we're in the kitchen, duh.
@BloodyPinkiePie Now, since I don't have any thing to cook you with or anything to ease the pain.. we'll have more fun... right??
@TheRedofRobins -- don't touch guns, alright?
@TheRedofRobins I understand but do me a favour. &gt; The gun that was in her hands quickly appear on hers, dropping the it in the process &lt; --
@BloodyPinkiePie I didn't know you would like this, THIS much! &gt; One after another she was done with the hooves &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie -- mares hooves just in case.. &lt;

@BloodyPinkiePie You could of gotten your own things dearest Pinkie but no.. &gt; Grabbing ahold of the knife, makes her way to the pony &lt;
// crappy drawings of the week made by yours truly 
@BloodyPinkiePie -- before &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie I told you again and again, pinkie and now it's time for a long nap.. &gt; She searches for the large knife she was using --
@TheRedofRobins Now answer me this, what's with the costume? &gt; She slowly approaches the robin, letting the streetlights revival herself &lt;
&gt; due to her boredom she sat in the middle of the active night road of the city, watching cars pass &lt;
@TheRedofRobins Trust me, I've seen enough. &gt; She crossed her arms with another giggle escaping from her lips &lt;
@TheRedofRobins &gt; This random act.. she just couldn't help but to giggle making her noticeable &lt;
&gt; Although @TheRedofRobins couldn't see her, Diane could see him, standing behind the red robin.. studying him &lt;
&gt; after she was done slicing away her last victim the pink woman decides to sit on the rooftops watching the night pass on &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie I had enough of you, pinkie.. &gt; The woman drags the pink earth pony to the table, strapping her down &lt;
@BloodyPinkiePie YOU WHAT? &gt; quickly grabs onto the ears of the pony, pulling the pink mare up &lt; what did I tell you..?
@BloodyPinkiePie the basement of course.. I don't want you breaking my things..
@BloodyPinkiePie Hm? &gt; Diane.. *ahem* Pinka knows who this is, narrowing her eyebrows and asks &lt; you've been staying away, correct?
&gt; The pink woman throws out the remains of her victim in the dumpster, she heads into her bakery but gets stopped by y/n &lt;
[OPENROLEPLAY]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- pulls down the screen curtains leading them into a much.. more private place, damn fourth wall breakers. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Reaching behind her to pull off his boxers, looks over at the screen with a quirked brow &lt; Haven't you seen enough? &gt; She-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She pulls away, calming her laughter down as she spoke, leaning on the surprise &lt; Now, let's have some fun, Hm?
@FeminineRobin -- into the dark &lt;
&gt; from the darken streets the pink woman quickly grabs onto @FeminineRobin pulling the "Sidekick" in and covering her mouth, pulling her --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her kisses become rough knowing how he likes it, she been giggling the whole time, excited maybe? &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Quickly uses her feet to unzip his jeans, ZIIIIIP, Diane plants kisses onto the hero's lips &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I heard.. it could help with your cold, hero. &gt; She giggles at her facts, she's knows it's enjoyable and Healthily &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- shoulders, leaving slight marks due to her nails &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her slight blush rushed onto her face causing her to gently chew down on her bottom lip, latching her fingers onto his --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- touch &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Maybe you should find out for yourself..~ &gt; She grabs onto the bind to undue it, grabbing onto the hero's hand to let him --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- and her scars cover her stomach from the wins and loses. Diane smirks at the lantern as she winks &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh...~? there is~? Do tell~ &gt; She spoke as she slides her tank off, bandages wrap around her breast to hide them for battle-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh~? Maybe there is something I could do to help..~ &gt; She traced her sharpen nails along his chest &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You feeling better, hero~? &gt; she asked as she easily slides his hood off, giggling to herself &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Slowly letting go as she pulls away, placing a kiss on his cheek &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She knew what she does to him, she loves it. soon moving to soft neck to carefully chew on it, teasing him &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she softly chews on his lip while pulling away, smiling at him &lt; Morning, hero.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she soon awakens to find herself on the lantern , moving up his body so their lips could meet, softly kissing him &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She began to drift off as well but with her mind blank, she didn't want Zalgo knowing that she is with John &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st if you say so..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Are you sure..? I did leave -- is this pay back for vanishing...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I hope so.. I hate to hear you in pain like this..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I don't know what to do to help you.. &gt; she sighs, ashamed of her lack of knowledge &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Yet, that would be out of character for Diane so.. instead she crawls on top of the hero.. her body presses against his &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She knew what she could do to him, oh yes, she knew she could tease him without trying &lt; What do you think you have..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; The woman sits on the candy like bed with a slight giggle, placing her hand on his leg &lt; it's fine.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st because I missed you.. &gt; She settles him on the bed with a sigh, looking around the room &lt; I'm getting an headache..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I was looking for you.. &gt; She dashed into a spare room, somehow getting through without a key &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh boy.. it seems bad.. I hope chicken soon will do.. &gt; She began to drag the man to an hotel &lt; We'll rest here, alright?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Who..? Well.. &gt; She slowly grabs onto John with a sigh, she grabs onto his arm with a sigh &lt; You're sick, aren't you?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- her waist and asks &lt; Is that a new disguise you go on there?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; the pink woman walks by to notice that he has fallen into a trash can.. with a slight chuckle as she slides her hands to--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; With a blink of an eye she seems to has disappeared... maybe she's at that waterfall... to that other world.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; It took a few moments to realise the hug causing her to slowly return the Huh and whisper "I love you, all of you" &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Being the shattered mess she is she stutters out her next sentence &lt; Well.. I-I love y-you too... and s-stuff..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- that name...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Mistaking it for something bad with a huff, looking away after that as she quietly apologises &lt; Sorry... do you not like -
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- contact once again, her blush grew every second she becomes more lost &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Jo-- um.. H-Hero.. &gt; She spoke to him as if her own desires as conquered her own body, instantly getting lost in eye --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; From the passion within the kiss caused tears to stroll down her face as she returns his passion with her own &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- slowly clings onto his hand.. I swear it's alive &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She slowly holds onto his arm with a bright smile.. she seems the happiest near this hero, because of her long hair it--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- his green eyes.. they became droopy &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; The finger made her a little ticked off but calms herself down.. she softly kisses his finger while soon getting lost in--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She became surprised! Her throat drys up as her stomach gives birth to thousands of butterflies &lt; I-- um.. I...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- you say...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She blinks, quickly wiping away her tears with a "Huh?" coming from her mouth, she wanted to make sure.. &lt; What did you --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Why not...? &gt; She made eye contact with her quickly healing eyes, showing her beautiful blue eyes once more &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- see...?", her sobbing became heavy &lt; Why are you still here....? go..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; With his lips against her cheek he could feel her own body shaking, she soon began to mumble "Why can I still fucking --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- I don't want you to go... I'm sorry.. I'm sorry..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Putting a halt to her clawing she turns her head towards the hero with her now bleeding eyes.. her sobbing continues &lt; --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- over her, slowly attempts to claw her sky blue eyes out &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She falls to her knees, covering her face as she silently sobs into her scarred hands, she felt the heavy sadness struck--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- alone.. you don't need me near you, you'll have TONS of girls with you.. &gt; her voice cracks up, holding back tears &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You know what.. &gt; She had attempt to push him away, having her cursed future sight she knew what could be &lt; Just leave me --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; zalgo had left, DIANE had heard it instead.. causing anger and heartbreak to build up &lt; What the hell is wrong with you?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Go right ahead you dumb fuck, those aren't mine. All I need is Diane~ She is the most valuable one out there~.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Sorry to break it to you but.. I do it just for fun...~ &gt; Zalgo began to chuckle, making Diane press her body on the hero &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh~? If you do that then I'll just.. kill the girl, make sure she'll never come back.. would you like that~?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh~? Did I say love~? I meant hate.. &gt; ZALGO soon pushes him a low chuckle, looking down at maud's grave with a grin &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- John, you know I love you, right~? I'm glad Maud's dead.. she was a bitch anyways.. always talking about her rocks..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st But.. &gt; Her eyes soon blacken as a twisted grin grew, this isn't Diane anymore.. it seems like Zalgo took over her body &lt; --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she pulled back with a slight growl, why?? Well, she is Diane... &lt; You're an idiot, you know that.. right?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- to plant a kiss on his lips.. her lips has been lonely.. it's filled with passion with a hint of anger &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No, you're still in there... you're just being stubborn.. &gt; She grabs onto his collar of his hoodie, pulling the hero down--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- hugging herself as her voice gave off the fact she is holding back tears &lt; You did leave me a lot.. you couldn't love me.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st John, do you want to risk it for something like me..? I'm just some girl..? you can get hurt.. &gt; Diane quickly got up, --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Her hat blush rushed to her cheeks, Diane knew what this means yet she didn't want any harm on him &lt; John...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st he'll just hurt you--... what did you just say..? &gt; It causes her to blink multiple times, not clear on what she heard &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- feelings at times) flutter, yet she speaks up during the nervousness &lt; ... leave and never come back, it's safer..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You'll get hurt.. just.. &gt; She makes eye contact with the hero causing both of their hearts (because they share the same --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- you... what should I do...? &gt; She looks up at him with dark circles under her eyes and scars printed on her face &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- and well.. whatever I have I guess.. John.. I'm honestly giving up.. everything and everyone I love has died.. besides--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I know what he's doing.. he tear people apart until they give up what he wants.. he wants my speed and well.. knowledge.. --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st L-Lord Zalgo.. he told me... I was misbehaving so.. he killed her.. &gt; She pulls away to wipe her own tears away &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- as she gives on speaking.. sobbing onto the hero's chest.. gripping onto his hoodie &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She.. she wasn't really my sister but.. she loved me.. she knew who and what I was but still.. &gt; Her voice became shattered-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- moves her mouth without speaking.. as if she couldn't say HER name &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; The pink woman looks up to see her hero before looking at the newly dug grave beside her, tears are pouring down as she --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- air &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She quickly sits up yet not noticing the hero, grass stuck to her silk like locks, her sighs are visible through the cold-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; The woman lays in the grass, staring at the cold, night star filled sky without a smile on her face &lt;
&gt; the pink woman sat in a tree listening to the wolfs howl to the shining moon, staring at her scars she soon lets out a sigh &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Why don't you go look for it~? &gt; She slowly rubbed her leg on his crotch with a smirk, biting down on her bottom lip &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Ticklish..? me..? n-nowhere~! &gt; She wiggles her toes with a small grin &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Soon grabbing onto his hand to pull him away.. it seemed that she's holding back.. what a tough cookie.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st like we always do. &gt; wasn't she ticklish..? she must be.. imagine her begging for mercy after laughing.. adorable &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st you should know I need my prove, hero~ &gt; she lets out a soft giggle that only few have ever heard &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I know you are just joking.. &gt; She chuckles along with him.. oh how she misses him.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You're still the same as I remembered.. but who would want this body that has been trapped in a cage for the longest time?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she quirks a brow.. mostly in confusion &lt; John.. have you been cu[GIGGLING]ddling me for the past 12-14 hours..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st John..? &gt; She answers back with a raspy voice, her cheeks light up with blush.. she couldn't help but to show a smile &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; it's been half a day.. her body twitches slightly with her heartbeat returning to a normal speed.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; it's been hours with the dead woman in his arms.. will it be like last time..? Her wounds are slowly healing.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; How many time must he kill her? although it's obvious she's dead for now.. she was in the middle of cuddling him.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; She began to mumble into John's hoodie "kill me.. let my body heal.. please.." &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- is shaking in his arms.. her soft sobbing could be heard.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; As they crashed they could both hear a large explosion.. could that have been the base..? In the longest time.. Diane --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st He doesn't care for us.. only his victory.. &gt; She quickly presses her fingers against his neck making them both fall &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No.. put me down.. you're walking in.. his trap.. &gt; she mumbles as the blood became more of a mess &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; Quickly shaking her head as she whimpers softly "leave me alone" as she appears on the ground once more &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- from the poor girls mouth.. tears streaming down her face as the street lights flicker &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; the woman had rolled onto her back to show claw like marks along her stomach having it cut open.. blood is also escaping--
&gt; the poor pink woman slowly crawled out of her cage after years.. the moon kissing the sky as she crawls, leaving a trail of blood &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM I guess you weren't lying.. let's check to see what's behind curtain number one.. &gt; She slowly unzips his green jeans.. ~ &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM ...? &gt; She quirked a brow.. soon sliding her hands to see if he was lying from before.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM **Rumors
@RiddleMeThisBM Rumours..?
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; She knew what it was.. her face lights up once again.. her senses told her something was up, literally &lt; I know..
@RiddleMeThisBM I'm guessing you..? &gt; she couldn't look at him.. she was embarrassed and honestly.. excited.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; she thought she was alone so she wasn't wearing a bra~ a large blush crosses her face &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM Tsk.. only if you want to.. I warn you I have scars of my deaths printed on me.
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; she bites down on her lip without realising it as she tugs at her brown loose sweater &lt; Oh hush..
@RiddleMeThisBM it must be my other side.. Pinkie since it couldn't be me but I'm guessing the answer you're wanting is me..
@RiddleMeThisBM Bullshit.. &gt; She crosses her arms.. her senses tells her something is up from afar.. she can sense HIM &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; She soon speaks up but is covered with her stuttering &lt; I-I can speak.. I.. I'm just n-not use to being flirted wi-with.
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; Her words became random gibberish, giving up speaking for now.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; flinches with the flirt, quickly turning around with rosy cheeks.. she couldn't find her words so she growled lightly &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM -- is curvy.. almost perfect.. &lt; Tell me.. why did you come to see me?
@RiddleMeThisBM If you say so.. But I don't agree, I've seen much.. well, you know. &gt; She got off the table.. her backside is perfect, she -
@RiddleMeThisBM Enough with the.. *Beauty* thing, it's not true in the slightest.. &gt; She turns meet eye contact with the riddler &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM How do you.. &gt; She hasn't heard the name of "Pinkamena" in a very long time.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM -- a secret, isn't it?
@RiddleMeThisBM I'm guessing you have a name but.. &gt; She calms her giggling, turning her eyesight towards the riddler with a smile &lt; It's --
@RiddleMeThisBM Oh my gosh. &gt; She couldn't help but to ....... giggle..?? If this was pinkie she would of got it right on spot.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM Whiskers? &gt; She wanted to get one right.. at least one &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; she slides her hands off her face, with a light blush she clears her throat &lt; Yeah.. *AHEM* It is...
@RiddleMeThisBM -- her of the word "friend" &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM Secrets..? &gt; She covers her face in embarrassment.. she KNEW it but friends slipped out of her mouth.. it must of reminded -
@RiddleMeThisBM I did have an idea but.. &gt; She scratches the back of her head to think of the answer but.. her mind refuses to think &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM Nothing else is coming to my head.. &gt; That is honestly depressing to think how she said that, she taps her chin &lt; Hm..
@RiddleMeThisBM let me guess.. a Friend? &gt; She quirked a brow.. she loves these riddles.. &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM -- once again &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM He probably does, most men do and I shouldn't drink, I can't get drunk and it sucks so.. why try? &gt; She sits on the table--
@RiddleMeThisBM -- of scotch but doesn't pull out a glass, she walks over to the riddler and hands the bottle over &lt; A gift I suppose.
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; Most likely the answer is both, she heads towards her cabinet full of illegal and legal alcohols, pulling out the bottle -
@RiddleMeThisBM hm..? Right.. normals are easily pickled.. What about scotch?
@RiddleMeThisBM -- table &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM It's Diane.. And What about some old fashion moonshine? Or something else~? &gt; She chuckles softly, slowly getting off the --
@RiddleMeThisBM Burban? what about something.. that has more of a kick?
@RiddleMeThisBM Meet me? Hilarious now, &gt; She goes to sit on her dissection table &lt; ... I'm assuming that's not tea.
@RiddleMeThisBM -- smile &lt; Got two things to ask you.. how did you get in and.. why did you go easy on me..?
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; She couldn't look at the stuffed body.. she felt horrible about it, making eye contact with the riddler with a slight --
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; This time.. she didn't answer out loud, Diane quickly heads to her basement.. turning on the light switch &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM She can't if the stuffed rainbow is dead. &gt; She whispers to herself, soon picking up the buzzer &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM -- what he means..?
@RiddleMeThisBM -- the mastermind behind this game? &gt; Diane hops off her chair and heads outside.. looking between the garbage cans &lt; Is --
@RiddleMeThisBM Well.. you managed to hack into my own television AND probably snuck in here when I was out so why wouldn't I want to meet -
@RiddleMeThisBM -- is ACTUALLY interested in this.. surprisingly at lease &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM Hm? Well alright.. is I guess I should go look for them or will you tell me where the first one is..? &gt; It seems like she --
@RiddleMeThisBM Riddles..? I do like riddles.. wait, why don't you just come over here?
@RiddleMeThisBM I'm mostly surprised on how you got into this gunky television set and-- erm, I mean hack-- can you even hear me..?
@RiddleMeThisBM What in the..? &gt; She quickly closed the oven, drags a chair over to meet face to face with the monitor &lt;
@RiddleMeThisBM &gt; with her hearing she looks up to see the monitor, with a quirked brow she sets the tray of cookies into the stove &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Why bother..? I'm the villain after all.. remember..? &gt; She forces herself to look at him.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No.. not if that will is long gone.. &gt; She grabs onto her arms to hug herself.. this woman is really suffering.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st DON'T SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE, JOHN. &gt; She growled towards him but.. she couldn't bare look at him.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You know... it's not going to be alright.. my sadness is a fucking loop and I can't do anything about it..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- sobbing got in the way &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ... wait.. please don't go.. I don't want to be alone.. I can't handle myself anymore.. &gt; She wanted to say that yet her --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Just leave me alone to rot in my own depression.. haven't you and your friends hurt me enough..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st how foolish do you think I am? Go bug your sidekick.. whoever that is..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st john... leave me alone... haven't I suffered enough? &gt; she questioned as she backed against the  stone wall &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she stepped away as she continues to shake..  trees stream down her cheeks as she mumbles something.. &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; since the pink woman had already pulled him there was no need, Diane's shaking, her chest was covered in her own blood &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; the stairs went on forever..  what it seemed like hands reaching out of the wall, pulling him into the basement &lt;
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; echoes could be heard from the basement but does the lantern remember how to get in? &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; It feels like they could be undone in the front, Diane couldn't help but to bite her lip &lt; So..?
@BeyondTimeandsp hm.. I find it adorable. &gt; She grabbed onto his hands to slide them up her loose sweater towards her bra &lt; there you go..
@BeyondTimeandsp I can tell your willpower is strong but could you handle it much longer? &gt; She notices the green shirt will a smirk &lt; oh~?
@BeyondTimeandsp So birdie, you seem excited.. I can hear by your breath and I could feel it.. literally. &gt; She slides his coat off &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp -- eye contact &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; Her skin tight jeans made it impossible to.. she decided to get up once again to face the hero sits on his lap to meet --
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; She had pressed herself against his bump knowing what he would want.. &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp -- around to sit on his lap.. she is a tease after all... &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp I told you once before, to bond with you in anyway possible. is this how you want to? &gt; The table had vanish, she turned --
@BeyondTimeandsp -- she was a tease &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp Hm..? Are you planning something, birdie? I can tell you're excited but I'm only me. &gt; her voice grew soft as if she KNEW -
@BeyondTimeandsp -- didn't lean any closer, their gaze locks onto each other &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp I guess you were right about always being excited.. it's kinda cute if you ask me. &gt; She pulled off a seductive smirk but--
@BeyondTimeandsp -- his hands to place them on her waist &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp Hm? Someone like you I would of thought you would of.. what a shame as well. &gt; she didn't seem angered, she grabs onto --
@BeyondTimeandsp You are? &gt; She quirked a brow as she crossed her arms &lt; Birdie, you want to explain yourself?
@BeyondTimeandsp do you like it soft or hard..? Do you get excited easily?
@BeyondTimeandsp Lets watch one of your favourites.. shall we? &gt; She slides herself off the table as she pulled away her hand &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp -- shoulder &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp Porn? Then we'll watch some.. you don't have to be so shy about it, birdie. &gt; Giggling softly as she places a hand on his -
@BeyondTimeandsp  hm..? let's watch it then.. it might be fun.
@BeyondTimeandsp hm? I'm guessing you wouldn't like that.. why don't we watch something that you like, birdy?
@BeyondTimeandsp Hm? You like those girly movies..? what about saw? something interesting?
@BeyondTimeandsp Hm.. which crappy movie should we watch tonight? &gt; She tilts her head to meet eye contact with him &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp Anything really.. we could watch a movie.. make plans.. do anything you wish, birdy.
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; although with the fear her body was still curvy.. she fixed her brown sweater before running her hand through her hair &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp A place I bought yesterday.. like it..? &gt; The woman sat on the table being there was only one chair &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp -- grabbing a chair to seat him down.. they seem to be in a house now.. &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp That's great to hear.. now let me grab you a seat. &gt; Diane grabbed onto her friend to turn him around showing a table, --
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; She reaches out to grab onto his coat, gazing up with her baby blue eyes &lt; Don't leave me.. all alone..
@BeyondTimeandsp -- that changes now..
@BeyondTimeandsp No, I have a feeling the lantern is single once again shame, isn't it..? you know.. we never spend time with each other..--
@BeyondTimeandsp Nothing.. just wondering how you're doing.. heh, have you heard..?
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; Diane slowly lifts her foot off from the strap. staring hard and long &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; The pink woman has stepped onto the strap of the bag with a huff &lt;
@BeyondTimeandsp &gt; The pink woman was leaning on a building with bruises coving her body, noticing Dylan she decided to follow him &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; The pink woman soon came back with a roast chicken and a small table, placing the chicken on the table &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE -- vanishes &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE Hm? I know, I'm aware. That's why I called them that now.. eat that sweet, I'll be back in a.. few. &gt; With her speed she --
@INSANOWILLRULE No. I have the bits to get the perfect chicken.. trust me.. it'll be tasty... got it?
@INSANOWILLRULE -- the frosted treat.. where does she keep those? &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE Then I'll buy some chicken for you..! don't you worry.. you'll love it.. have s cupcake while you wait. &gt; She pulls out --
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; she lets herself smile towards Insano, loosening her grip &lt; Good.. now, what would you like to eat?
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Diane let out an protective growl before grabbing onto his collar &lt; Listen here, I'm getting something in you.
@INSANOWILLRULE -- we need to get you something to eat..
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; This to her, was familiar taste of that poison she desperately wants &lt; I promise not to leave you again... got it..? and -
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Once again going to her toes to get some hight &lt; why must you be so tall...?
@INSANOWILLRULE I hoe you don't.. we are fuck ups together, aren't we? [I don't want this *Party* to end..]
@INSANOWILLRULE .... please don't be lying to me.. I can't handle lies.. &gt; Diane reaches for INSANOs goggles to slowly remove them &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE please never leave me.. &gt; she spoke softly with tears overflowing her eyes &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE -- the past &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; she mumbles the words "I love you" into the kiss, trying to keep herself from her hair from curling she had to think of --
@INSANOWILLRULE Insano.. &gt; she goes on her toes once again, having to pull him down to kiss his lips with her passion &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE ... Yes.. I will.. 
But will you be my frosting to my cupcakes..? Laughter to my idiotic puns..? Can you be my doctor..?
@INSANOWILLRULE -- getting better.
@INSANOWILLRULE I'm sure.. Zalgo let his thoughts flow through me.. I'm like his favourite doll since I don't do much.. I'll be fine, it's -
@INSANOWILLRULE -- power.. she would love to be with you, I'm sure of it.
&gt; of course Diane knew who @INSANOWILLRULE was talking about &lt; 
I have a feeling that the someone might be replaced by another with great --
@INSANOWILLRULE -- them how much an amazing guy you are..
@INSANOWILLRULE apple jack--- maybe not... flu-- she is just too shy to talk to anyone.. who is it? I could bring her here and tell --
@INSANOWILLRULE Have you found who you are looking for? Maybe check Twilight out.. maybe Luna..
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; she glances around the area.. somehow felt comfortable for her, she looks over at Insano &lt; ... may I ask you something?
@INSANOWILLRULE ... &gt; with her excellent hearing Diane heard the corps coming, she has been wanted for awhile now.. &lt; They're coming..
@INSANOWILLRULE You should wear that smile in more.. it's cute.. &gt; Diane could help but to kiss him again.. short kisses &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE -- landing on their lap &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE Do you feel it or am I just going crazy..? That fluttering sensation.. &gt; Tears seem to be streaming down her cheek and --
@INSANOWILLRULE -- eyes shine bright towards the love in his &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; with Zalgo's fairness he returns her eyesight letting her glimpse at His eyes &lt; .... Insano..? &gt; she cups his face, her --
@INSANOWILLRULE ... I'm sorry.. I don't know what came over me.. you could say I was blind to do that.. since.. you know..
@INSANOWILLRULE -- forced to go on her toes &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; it seems like from all the blood there are tears coming from her eyes, she wraps her arms around his neck as she was --
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; after finding the face she feels for his lips.. she pulls him down so she could plant a kiss &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Diane felt as if she she speak up, She felt for his face &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE it feels like.. when someone is in love.. you know.. the feeling.. erm-- it's nice I guess.
@INSANOWILLRULE -- heart seems to be fluttering..
@INSANOWILLRULE I know, his "slaves" can feel what he feels and at this moment.. &gt; She places her hand where her heart would be &lt; My --
@INSANOWILLRULE it was, wasn't it? Well it's back.. I had to rejoin Him to get my home back.. but that's fine.
@INSANOWILLRULE it was just a stupid question.. well, I fixed it, much cleaner now.. and all.
@INSANOWILLRULE Then let's get go to the corner.. I'm guessing you know about the basement, right...?
@INSANOWILLRULE -- mouth &lt; you can come with me, live with me.
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Diane knew what she should do, looking up at "Insano" with the black inky blood oozing down from her nose, eyes and --
@INSANOWILLRULE Attack you? No, even if I did do you really think I know where you are...? I'm just making sure I know you're still here..
@INSANOWILLRULE ...? What's wrong? &gt; Of course she would be confused.. she is blind after all &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE ... &gt; She wasn't sure what to call him but it didn't matter at the moment, Diane gripped onto his lab coat &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE you did..?
@INSANOWILLRULE ... Did I do something wrong..?
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Diane soon pulled away with smile.. through these years she finally shows off her true smile... not just that fake grin &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE -- from her eyes &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; Diane reaches for his face to see where his lips are, soon presses her own against his with oil like Substance oozing--
@INSANOWILLRULE ... I know, I can sense the waves coming off you..
@INSANOWILLRULE ...? &gt; It was a surprise for her.. she loves them causing her cheeks to turn a crimson red &lt;
@TheEvilOneLuLs Pain..? I know someone that would say that..
@TheEvilOneLuLs Use to it?? What the hell is that supposed to mean??
@TheEvilOneLuLs You get sick..? then be harsh towards me..! I don't want you to be ill..
@TheEvilOneLuLs // I ship EVERYONE//
He says different, do you even know him at all..? he says you never bothered to pay attention.
@TheEvilOneLuLs // I'm a twisted person//

Heck.. he is even ticklish.. don't you know? or did you bother to even pay attention to him?
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; AGAIN, without the warning Diane jumps slightly due to not knowing she was getting hugged &lt;
.. I guess so..
@TheEvilOneLuLs He does have feelings just show him that someone DOES care.. he is a mess if you do so. //WINK WONK WANK //
@INSANOWILLRULE ... &gt; This Diane seem to have been the most damaged one of them all.. even with Lucy by her side she twitches and shivers..&lt;
@TheEvilOneLuLs He took away my eyesight because of that..? I haven't done anything wrong. &gt; her expression seemed more upset then before &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE Your Diane? Maybe there is another.. have you checked?
@TheEvilOneLuLs &gt; The woman jumped slightly due to the lack of warnings &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE &gt; her eyesight fades leaving her ears to do the work &lt; who do you love? You still never told me.
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- this fate &lt; ... &gt; her eyes return to normal but.. his blue eyes seem faded into a misty blue &lt;
@TheEvilOneLuLs &gt; Upsetting the youngest bother caused him to cause dash to lose her eyesight.. her body is locked.. no even death could--
@INSANOWILLRULE she doesn't love, all she cares about it having fun.. that means she'll end up cheating on you.. all the time.

@INSANOWILLRULE Take a risk then.. try kissing Dashie.. or someone else.. since I'm obviously not right for any of you.
@TheEvilOneLuLs .... &gt; Diane has the hardest time on trusting others but.. this time.. she chooses to believe &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE No, you're wrong. Trust me.. very wrong... you never answered my question.
&gt; this wasn't an answer, Diane let a growl slip towards @TheEvilOneLuLs &lt; 
You didn't answer me.
@INSANOWILLRULE -- tell me who it is i could show them what a great guy you are.
&gt; knowing that @INSANOWILLRULE had a few before the pink one she sighs slightly.. shattered if one must say &lt;
I maybe useless but if you --
@TheEvilOneLuLs Out of all these poor souls, why did you pick the most weakest.. more pathetic one out there?
@INSANOWILLRULE Your love? Your life..? maybe I could help with that.. I did see all of it..
@TheEvilOneLuLs may I ask something my dearest?
@INSANOWILLRULE -- in this moment? I could help you.
@INSANOWILLRULE You're no monster, you're no shell. You can live how you want now. Nothing is holding you back, what would you like --
@TheEvilOneLuLs Right, I remember now.. it's been so l̵̷͢ơ͜͢ņg̶̨͏ since I threw a party.. and the days seem like seconds to me.
@INSANOWILLRULE Why do you cry? Why do you like the pain you cause yourself? &gt; she spoke softly as she placed her hand on his shoulder &lt;
Oh @TheEvilOneLuLs, do you know my birthday? I seem to have forgotten it.
(somehow the pink woman stands behind @INSANOWILLRULE, softly places her hand behind his back to comfort him)
@TheEvilOneLuLs Alright.. let's go then.. let's hurry.
@TheEvilOneLuLs (Diane shows no fear then again, does she even have any? Even with the simple kiss on the cheek it's filled with passion)
@TheEvilOneLuLs it's nothing big and I don't mind..~ (she went her toes as if she was trying to land a kiss on his cheek)
@TheEvilOneLuLs W-Would you like me to make you more..?
@TheEvilOneLuLs Really? well, I rarely eat as well.. I could-- wait.. did you say you liked it or am I just hearing things?
@TheEvilOneLuLs oh? Pardon me if you don't like it, I should of known better..
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- goodness..
@TheEvilOneLuLs you never tried one..? well try.. it's my favourite treat.. it's a little old but I'll bake you more so you get the fluffy--
@TheEvilOneLuLs Yes but first.. (the woman slowly got herself to a table to grab a stale cupcake, she comes back with a grin) cupcake?
@TheEvilOneLuLs I cannot remember the face since it was from behind and I was a wanted women for a VERY long time.
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- years before some brat beheading me.
@TheEvilOneLuLs That's why I've been calling you Lucy, I died moments after you did.. at least they thought. I lived for a couple more --
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- you.
@TheEvilOneLuLs I've never forgotten about you, I'm no new "monster", I only take this form since everyone trusts me.. I've never forgotten-
@TheEvilOneLuLs If you say so.. say.. will you still be around or with death take over you..?
@TheEvilOneLuLs Zalgo? No, he won't.. he sees me and the others as a "drum set".. but why pick me..?
@TheEvilOneLuLs You love me....? then I will.. I will become your queen Lucy.. (Diane stood up, having to look up at the devil)
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- someone as pointless as me...?
(Diane's eyes has widen hearing  @TheEvilOneLuLs, she'll be a queen? She didn't care about that.. she didn't need to think about it) why --
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- as she returns the kiss once again knowing what her feelings are once again)
(still surprised by @TheEvilOneLuLs kiss and words but it made her have that feeling of hope once again, tears stream down Diane's cheeks --
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- passionate kiss towards the ruler)
(indeed Diane is shocked from @TheEvilOneLuLs's actions.. mostly confused yet.. it felt right for some reason causing Diane to return the --
@TheEvilOneLuLs -- something as worthless as me?
@TheEvilOneLuLs (the tiny woman looks up with a light sigh, her eyes felt like she has died but forced to come back) what do you want with -
@TheEvilOneLuLs (she stares at him, flinching every time he moves closer)
@TheEvilOneLuLs Why don't you leave this dying woman to be.. well, dead? I've already died countless times already throughout this year.
@TheEvilOneLuLs (she notices him but just sighs, since she is in her basement she never ate in awhile nor slept) you won.. happy..?
@INSANOWILLRULE we-- (she pauses and soon lets go of the hug) never mind it..
@INSANOWILLRULE its fine.. I know the pain to lose everything.. I did.. five times already..
@INSANOWILLRULE you called me fake once.. do you remember..?
@INSANOWILLRULE John.. am I really the fake? (she attempts to jog his memory.. just a bit by this question)
@INSANOWILLRULE (Diane couldn't help but to hug this John.. it made her feel somewhat better)
@INSANOWILLRULE You heard of me as well..? well alright..
@INSANOWILLRULE (she is tiny.. tiny and it looks like she hasn't been eating these past days) you are.. I'm Diane I guess..
@INSANOWILLRULE .. she is annoying, isn't she..?
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st (she looks over at him but her sadness worsens)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she kept silent as she follows John.. she really has nothing to say)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (Diane was already outside.. waiting for John to catch up)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Friends..? I have none.. (she didn't grab his hand.. she got up by herself)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st then why did you wait for me? Hm..? oh well.. it doesn't matter anyways, does it?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Why not? I can see in some other times they are together and you're by yourself... sad, isn't it?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st He gots rainbow dash and that hyperactive bitch...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I know it's like to be alone..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st wait.. that John..? yes.. I did meet him.. he called me fake... maybe I am the fake.. (she hugged her knees)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st no.. I haven't...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I don't know.. he might hurt me like he was when I was with you.. I won't join... but I'll help.. and me? smile..? never..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st My skills..? what skills? I am worthless.. I hold no skills.. (her sigh sounds shattered.. as if she was crying recently)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- me up now..? at least I'll have a jail cell..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- dead.. my other two families are dead because I quitted my job.. I gave you everything I have.. are you going to lock--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ... I'm guessing you want to take me away as well..? you know.. lock me up since I have nothing left.. my whole "family" is-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Zalgo..? is that -- (she looks over to find John.. her heart sinks) -- you...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (the basement is full of vodka bottles.. she was on the floor cuddling up to a rotting body.. softly singing to herself)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (there was no traps, weird by the looks of it she could be in the basement)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (no one answers.. but the door seems to be unlocked)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash -- to stab her "bestie")
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash she brainwashed you... d-didn't SHE? (Diane pulled the golden bayonet.. why did she have that? Diane attempts-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash she turned you around... d-didn't she? you are will m-me....!! R-right..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash (with her speed she was now directly behind John with a crooked grin) W-What a f-funny joke yo-you played..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash (just then.. her anger overflowed Diane.. she pulled out her pistol to aim for RD) I hate you..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash [I don't want to be alone.. I love him.. I might break.. I'll loose it.. I'll kill Rainbow.. he is MINE]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash Answer me this, who would you rather be with..? Me or Rainbow..? kiss the person you want..
// pardon me Twitter? 
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash ... (her blue eyes turn red once again but she doesn't Attack.. just stares at them.. with hatred)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash you promised me.. I gave you my HEART..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @RocketToDash (it took her a moment but she realized..) did you cheat on me...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Well.. alright..!
@TheAnt1_Chr1st there's gotta be something wrong...!
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she wasn't fast on it but she noticed his tone of voice) what's wrong...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st So.. we need to get food in you, you know.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Isn't she the bestest? (she shows a smile not knowing that her nightmare is coming true)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Well.. okay, if you say so.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ....? what's wrong love..?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st my throat feels better now that I have you.. my love.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You better.. because I really do love you..

@TheAnt1_Chr1st [no.. I mean.. my personality.. you seem to like that other princess's personally.. a lot..]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [..... do you think I'm interesting anymore...?] (that question seem to come out of nowhere..)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st b--- b-- [but you want one..]

@TheAnt1_Chr1st I-- I-- [im so sorry.. I failed you..]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (it hurts for her to speak.. this thought killed her inside causing her to break into tears)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [Maybe I should lay down..] (she sighs.. the sudden realization of their child.. broke her heart) the.. our..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [no.. I'll do it..] (she didn't have enough energy to pick up a plastic plate..)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she sprints up to run to the kitchen to make a.. feast for them both) [then I'll cook something!]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [Have you been eating...? sleeping...? taking breaks...?]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [john...] (she couldn't help but Attack his cheeks with kissed)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st [Im sorry for the wait.. getting back into my body with suicide is much.. much harder.]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (due to her being dead for so long.. she has lost her voice.. making her mute for the time being.. she returns the hug)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (the pink women aimed her eyes towards John)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (after awhile the body in the bag began to twitch..)
(due to her pregnancy she could be spotted eating someone behind a tree)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Dylan...? not without you.. (finding the strength in herself she had picked up her love)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she kneels down to check if everything was alright with his head.. to see if anything is broken) w-why...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st John... don't leave me alone.. I ca-can't be al...alone.. I lo... love you..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- g-give u..up.. don't you dare th-think about that..

@TheAnt1_Chr1st ....? What do you think you're doing...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No.. I feel FREE.. Do you want me to be a just a pile of flesh again??
@TheAnt1_Chr1st So you're just going to give me up...? DONT YOU LOVE ME? (the villain growls John's name) John... why would you betrayed me?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st DON't you dare leave me alone.. in this World so... cold.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ...~? Why would you do that do me, love~?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Because.. even you can't catch me.. my love.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm afraid you... CANT do that my love..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st T-those kind of people are always THE BEST..

@TheAnt1_Chr1st What are we going to do...? well... I'm getting hungry... I haven't seen you in.. what it felt like for YEARS...

@TheAnt1_Chr1st Gotten into me... ever heard of fun..? (behind her mask she had a twisted grin)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ... are you going to arrest me? are you going arrest your wife who loves you~?
@XEyeLessJackX A contest? a new friend? this is all news to me.
@XEyeLessJackX so.. What have you been up to Jack?
@XEyeLessJackX (she threw a kidney that was still dripping towards Jack so he could catch it)
@XEyeLessJackX (she removed the hood from her head with a sigh) If I give you some kidneys could you stay with me tonight?
@XEyeLessJackX long time no... chat, am I right?

@TheAnt1_Chr1st **world
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (nothing happens... it seems like she ran into her other word..)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (the pink demon was gone.. she still had her speed.. why did she run like that...?)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (before she got up to dash away from her lover she looks back at him with cold eyes)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st LiEs! (she had jumped out from John's arms but tumbles to her knees)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Fine.. let her steal you away.. it's not my problem I guess.. (Diane would NEVER act like this.. what has gotten into her?)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (her bright red eyes darken to a blood red) No...? why not...? friend..? she is trying to steal you away..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh..~? let her down harshly.. make her cry...
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Hopefully.. hey john.. I love you, you know that right...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No, it's fine.. maybe it will fade away by tomorrow.. right?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Like shit.. hungry.. but mostly like shit..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- white, could this hurt the demon she that will come out of the poor pink girl..?)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (as he carried the ill Diane something powerful could be felt coming from her, her once beautiful skin is now a ghostly--
@TheAnt1_Chr1st My love... could you help me to our special place...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st It's fine.. I just need some... rest, that's all..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st .. well.. besides the fact that.. a THING bit me and nobody helped me get a large stick of wood out of my leg.. just fine.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (She awoken from the quick nap, her eye colour seem to change from a bright blue to a bright red) .... what the hell...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (then what's the liquid coming from the wound...? she did get bitten by something earlier on that same leg..)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (Did John check if the needle was clean...? there is black liquid dripping from the stitches)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she was out cold and the stitching became messy due to the blood)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (the blood continues to flow out of her leg.. it wouldn't be long till she dies once more)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st @INSANOWILLRULE (due to the blood loss she has fainted as the beams collide)
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st (Diane couldn't move to get out of the yellow beam)
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st [i know he is isn't really.. you..] .... what the hell is going on here..?
@INSANOWILLRULE @TheAnt1_Chr1st [what the hell is going on here..]
@INSANOWILLRULE ... I didn't ask for this. ( she attempts to step backwards but with her injured leg she fell over)
@INSANOWILLRULE No! CALM THE FUCK DOWN. (she had grabbed onto both of his hands as her headache worsens)
@INSANOWILLRULE You remember...? [i think I'm getting to him.. calming him down that is..] Maybe I could help you.. just keep calm..
@INSANOWILLRULE ... what about... [Come on.. think.. oh right...!] the first time we wed.. [he should remember this.. this was with John.]
@INSANOWILLRULE .... (she didn't mind being hit since her father did it a lot towards the young pinkamena) ... remember the jail..?
@INSANOWILLRULE -- and so right..) Enough is enough.
@INSANOWILLRULE (since she was in the middle of a BLEEDING leg and a KILLER MIGRAINE she pulled INSANO in for a hug.. it felt so calming--
@INSANOWILLRULE (she holds onto her slapped cheek as she holds back her anger) .....! Johnny, stop it. Why did you hurt me...?
@INSANOWILLRULE (she notices his reactions her face softens as she was forced to pull the stick out herself before approaching INSANO)
@INSANOWILLRULE -- his help)
@INSANOWILLRULE (a pink woman came out of the abounded SCC with a large stick coming out of her leg) ... (noticing "John" she cries out for-
( the pink women hung by a nearby tree as she waves towards @XEyeLessJackX) Jack! Over here! it's me, Pinka!
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (quickly returning the kiss.. she put passion into this kiss.. it's been along time)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I know..~ now, why don't you do your job, my love.. (although she was tiny her seductive grin wasn't)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I have, haven't i~? why don't you give me what I deserve..~?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I know it was, now, would you like to lock me up somewhere so you could punish me~? (she winked at her lover)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm just joking with you my love.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st  (letting out a sigh towards the green lantern, soon crossing her arms) Are you here to arrest me?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ...(looking up to see the familiar light.. she sighs knowing what will happen due to the fact that she is a CP once again)
@Miss_Sweden_ But it is, trust me~!
@Miss_Sweden_ I guess I'm not timid with your adorable stare.. I'm not s normal human, Miss.
// I NEED TO WATCH MY GAY COUNTRIES AGAIN BUT I CANT

@Miss_Sweden_ Oh? I was suppose to be scared? I thought you were just making an cute face, Hun. (she doesn't look to be the one who is --
@Heta_LA__ Agreed.. so.. where is it?
@Miss_Sweden_ you heard nothing, dear.
@Heta_LA__ -- get to your place.
@Heta_LA__ (Diane got caught, FIVE MINUTES LATER, Diane walks out with lipstick stains covering her neck) on second thought.. let's just --
@Miss_Sweden_ I never do.. you're being delusional..
@Heta_LA__ Well fuck.. lets slip out of here.. (she returns the whispering)
@Miss_Sweden_ it's "okay"..? what's okay...?
@Heta_LA__ Uh LA, you do realize.. we're in a gay bar, right?
@Miss_Sweden_ Not.... bad...? I WORKED HARD ON THOSE LAST NIGHT--- ugh, really? such a shame.
@Heta_LA__ (she slowly walks in as well, scanning the bra) ...
@Miss_Sweden_ (she continues to hold the plate.. waiting for the female Sweden take her treat) .. Um.. bon appetit! or something.
@Heta_LA__ Well, enter, don't be shy.
@Miss_Sweden_ (soon throwing the tray in the air to catch the classic on a plate, where is she getting all these items?!)
@Heta_LA__ (the pink woman was surprisingly light as a bag of feathers, she tightens her grip)
@Miss_Sweden_ -- she get it? nobody will find out)
@Miss_Sweden_ Cinnamon buns? the real question is... what kind~? (she pulls out a tray of different types of cinnamon buns.. where did --
@Heta_LA__ Well, I do love surprising others..
@Miss_Sweden_ I have Candy, fluffy treats... soda.. just name it!
@Heta_LA__ (she wanted to surprise "Los Angeles" by jumping onto her back causing her to carry Diane, Diane does so)
@Miss_Sweden_ Uh.. you like beer? Sweets?
@Heta_LA__ Good choice.. well, I don't know my way around here, show me the way.
@Miss_Sweden_ [Why is every woman I speak to taller than me...??]
So, Would you like to do something?
@Miss_Sweden_ just wondering.. that's all~!
@Heta_LA__ So.. LA, where to? a Bar or library?
@Miss_Sweden_ Lucky me.. so, "Miss Sweden" why do you choose to someone as invisible as me?
@Miss_Sweden_ Sweden..? you mean like that Country...?
@Heta_LA__ So, ... I could call you LA, right? (as they walked she turned her head)
@Miss_Sweden_ Oh...? well no problem.. I suppose.
@Heta_LA__ That's more like it. (this time the pink woman walked towards the large city without holding onto her friends hand)
@Heta_LA__ Sure? that doesn't give me much of an answer.
@Heta_LA__ the blond boys are more easier then most.. so, where shall we start? (she decided to slip back into her normal gear)
@Heta_LA__ (she gets out of the water to grab her suit, sighing out) well I guess I could walk around in my swimwear.
@Heta_LA__ Oh? if we do that, the men would look at like normal women.. and since we're in an hot state... let's just get some skirts on.
@BeyondSpaceAndT I would but.. bumble is still here.. I can't do that I'm afraid.
@BeyondSpaceAndT listen.. what the hell do you really want? I'll do it if you leave me and Jessie alone...
@BeyondSpaceAndT Lucy, can't you see? there is already a male me out there.. if there is two then... this world would be no more..
@BeyondSpaceAndT (the green mist was stopped by an familiar blue mist.. it felt much more powerful then Diane..) ... it's him.. Lucy.. stop.
@BeyondSpaceAndT (she didn't bother to even read the note... she didn't trust anything anymore)
@Heta_LA__ let us gooooooo!
@BeyondSpaceAndT (she stayed far away from the box knowing what could be inside)
@Jack_Fire69 (she looked over with a sigh) ...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ...! Jessie..! (she could help but to blush, the portal soon closed.. no outsider could come in at this point)

@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- the well hidden entrance.. revealing a whole new world.. it was beautiful.. empty.. but Beautiful)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- waterfall.. nothing but a wall....? no, it was the same as the SCC, Diane had to grab onto Jessie as they walked through-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st This place.. before I took the shape of this body.. this was my home.. now follow me. (she carefully made her way under the-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- stops at an waterfall large waterfall) .. can you feel it?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st We must hurry though.. (quickly pulls her lover in for a quick run, heading towards a forest that.. felt strange.. she --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- water, it will BURN.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st somewhere.. our new special place.. somewhere that no one can enter besides me.. I shall let you in but... don't touch --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- let Lucifer win.. not in a million years)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- grabs onto her naked and upset lovers hands to pull Jessie away to safety, Diane was worried about this but she will not-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st C'mon love.. let's find a place where we could start another life.. together without anymore interruptions.. okay? (she --
@Heta_LA__ To the city!
@TheAnt1_Chr1st We should get you clothes first my love.. Let's get somewhere safe then I'll grab you some clothes.. Okie dokie?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st ... you can live with me.. until they come and kick me out---WAIT.. no.. bad idea.. nevermind.. maybe we could rebuild it?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- gold, zipping it down as if it was a coat..)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st You know.. I knew it was you as soon as I saw you.. you need to hide yourself better.. but.. (she placed a zipper on the --
@TheShaduw That's harmless enough.. (she places a finger on the gold to see if it was still wet, quickly taking the helmet off of the hero)
@TheShaduw -- anything but I could use my shirt.. that might not work though.. Hm..
@TheShaduw (she noticed, she knew who this was, it didn't take long for her..)
Well, how should I take it off? just wipe? I don't have --
@TheShaduw The shadow? ... would you like some help with that..?
@TheShaduw (shocked at first but instead of fighting she remembers what she was told) ... who are you...?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she ran to the bar, searching for Jessie, she shows sighs of panicking)
@BeyondSpaceAndT .... fuck you... (slowly backing away to find her love, running in her incredible speed)
@Heta_LA__ Oh? I guess we should go search, should we..~?
@Heta_LA__ now, do you know where some are~?
@Heta_LA__ well.. I'll show you after we find one.. or many~!
@Heta_LA__ volleyball? I don't really understand that game.. why don't we go tease the boys~?
@Heta_LA__ Surfing? There are no waves at the moment, we could leave the ocean and hit something else if you want...?
@Heta_LA__ Hm, so you want to scuba dive? It's too dark to see that.. silly.
@Heta_LA__ -- like to do....~?
@Heta_LA__ (she pulled off a smirk as she swam around her friend with a grin) yes.. I do love myself some fun, tell me.. what would you --
@Heta_LA__ We aren't done yet.. (she pulls her friend into the deep waters.. where danger lays) we're going to have some more fun.
@Heta_LA__ (soon letting go, her own soaking body reached the surface, the moons light shimmers onto the pink woman's body)
@Heta_LA__ (using her speed to appear behind the other female, grabbing by the the chest to pull them under, playfully)
@Heta_LA__ (she covered her eyes for.. reasons as she got splashed, returning the splash with a wide grin)
@Heta_LA__ (Diane shows a faint smile as she got deeper into the water)
@Heta_LA__ Well, c'mon.. let's get in while no one is around..! (once again grabbing her friend's hands to pull her into the water)
@Heta_LA__ -- shirt, soon slipping out of her pants as well)
@Heta_LA__ then let's take these clothing off, shall we? (Diane unzips her top revealing a two piece navy blue bikini, she pulls off her --
@Heta_LA__ well.. you have something underneath, right?
@Heta_LA__ (with a fade smile she grabs onto her new friend hands to drag her towards the closest beach) empty Huh...? that's great...!
@Heta_LA__ I can bake, mix drinks and I know a lot of things now, shall we head to the beach before it gets too cold?
@Heta_LA__ Sometimes but I can get a headache occasionally..
@Heta_LA__ -- that made them irresistible.
@Heta_LA__ My si-- ugh.. when I was younger someone taught me how to bake cupcakes.. then another friend shown me this secret ingredient--
@Heta_LA__ I know! the scc did make the best cupcakes~! such a shame it has.. disappeared.
@Heta_LA__ -- on that tree)
@Heta_LA__ (she has pulled out a tray of yellow and red cupcakes) well, eat up. (where did she get it? nobody will ever know, Diane leans --
@Heta_LA__ then we could just walk, I don't mind. (Diane walks towards a tree with a sigh)
@Heta_LA__ well... (in a blink of an eye the pink women was behind the blonde) You know, lighting fast, maybe faster?
@Heta_LA__ good plan now do follow me.. wait! are you fast?
@Heta_LA__ we could, I guess the real question is.. what should we do first?
@Heta_LA__ we could go to the beach.. or maybe eat the rest of the cupcakes I baked before I quit my job.
@Heta_LA__ Sure.. why not? I haven't did anything in an while.
@Heta_LA__ I don't have the time for that for any of that... maybe I heard you from Jane.. but oh well, we'll never know.
@Starfire_ttg_10 (the woman wanted to surprise one of the titans so she.. without any warning... has appeared besides Starfire) ~
@Heta_LA__ -- damn familiar?
@Heta_LA__ I still don't know myself and it's strange but I shouldn't get my problems into your life.. now.. why does that name sound so --
@Heta_LA__ no, not friend I'm saying fiend, the whole underworld to be exact and why? I think it's because I'm "unworthy" of the bloodline.
@Heta_LA__ You don't need to speak my full name.. just Diane and.. besides trying to not get my ass killed by some fiends.. great, really.
@Heta_LA__ -- jumped right out of an action movie or maybe gore?)
@Heta_LA__ .. Diane Pie, I guess it's an pleasure to meet you as well....? (she has crossed her arms.. this pink chick looks as if she--
@Heta_LA__ Hm? oh yes.. right.. no problem.
@DesirableWaifu /// WHY THE FUCK DID I CLICK ON THAT

OH GOD

THAT JAR 

AND HIS ASS

I FELT THAT DURING THE VIDEO//
@PencilShavingsJ ... it does? He gave me hope but.. well.. now he is a she.. hehe...
@BeyondSpaceAndT ....!!! (with a loud growl she pulled out her Bayonet from her gun belt, attempting to slice the fiend)
@PencilShavingsJ .... Are you talking about John?
@BeyondSpaceAndT Oh really? I know five people who could take you on.. (she has walk up looking up at the ruler with an angered glare)
@PencilShavingsJ ...? well.. I've heard weirder.. say, who is your dad...?
@BeyondSpaceAndT I'm aware and you're weak compared to me, little boy. (she growls lightly as she taps her foot against the dirt)
@PencilShavingsJ Oh...? hello...
@BeyondSpaceAndT How about you fuck off..? I'm going to show you true pain if you try to feed us that..
@BeyondSpaceAndT Is it because I'm much stronger then you without their help...? or is from along time ago.. when I tricked you~?
@BeyondSpaceAndT What? Did you kill her? She'll come back.. laughter never dies.. what are you looking for Lucy? Why bug us..?
@BeyondSpaceAndT No.. you won't win because Me and Jessie will wed! Why are you trying so... hard? What will get you to... stop?
@BeyondSpaceAndT We could live with my friend.. BEN, Why? He owes me.. he owns his own land.. er-- world I should say.. give up, Lucy.
@BeyondSpaceAndT It won't work.. this place could tear off your wings if you continue, he they will get pissed and you know it.
@BeyondSpaceAndT (she came back to see Lucifer in his act) you know.. you can't burn this place down.. it's /theirs/ now.
@PencilShavingsJ (when he got to the bottom there was nothing but a dead end)
@PencilShavingsJ (there was nothing.. nothing but dust)
@PencilShavingsJ (but no one answered since it looked abounded)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st GREAT! Now let's keep get the rings on. [this time, it will last, I hope]
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I over heard that you didn't like parties, should we do a private one?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st What did you expect? She loves to party.. fucking slut.. now I don't have to deal with that.. so, our wedding, shall we?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st She is probably dead by now but I might be wrong.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Pinkie? oh right... she is her own person now, I have nothing to do with her, they did that.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm sorry for before, that wasn't really me making those choices, that was them.. time to know the real me, right?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Well first off, we're not on earth anymore. we are nowhere so I really don't know, I can't remember where everything is..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- that, I have my skills.. I guess.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh and don't worry about that boy, he'll be back to his sister in no time.. healthy and whatnot. and you don't need to do --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh really~? (she joked around with that... cruel topic, as they leave the Sugarcube corner... they are in the forest...)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I mean, i have to be careful now, let's get out of here. (pulling Jessie with her to leave the rotten room)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- pull her up) I hope you know this is going to be much harder, right?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st They have already started, if I die, I'm gone for good.. let's get out of this place.. (she grabs onto Jessie's hand to --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- quit. (inside the pink woman it felt a burning pain but she didn't show it)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I had my fun but I don't want to risk hurting you, I know Lucifer's plans and I won't play go the path he wants me to, I --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- onto the ground) ... I quit, I'm not doing this anymore.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st (she knew what was happening, she didn't want to hurt her anymore, slowly pulling the knife out of dipper to drop the knife-
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I'm not lying to you, I swear I'm not lying to you, I swear I'm not.. I would die a thousand times to stay with you.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- was shaky.. she really didn't want to hurt John)
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Jessie, you know I love you right? But I m-must do my job.. (with the thought in her mind the blade cutting across Dipper --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st More powerful, you know.. that's why I was afraid to be in a relationship with you, I didn't want to crush you..
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- than both of us.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Jessie.. your number is before mine is, don't worry. I'll be gentle with you and you cannot do that, is far more powerful --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st No.. that is not possible, his number came up and if I just him go.... they will get angry.. I must do this.
@TheAnt1_Chr1st If I think enough I think it's your ex's bother..? Dipper or something...? ...~?  look at all those tears...~!
@TheAnt1_Chr1st -- wasteful tongue off.. such a laugh, am I right?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st I don't know, never saw him in my but his number came up, he kept wining about his sister's safety so I had to cut his --
@TheAnt1_Chr1st Oh hello darling, knock first maybe? (her victim seemed familiar... to him..)
@Cute_Chiii_Chan (she has noticed chii but having no idea what this... humanoid she became confused) What... what are you?
@TheAnt1_Chr1st &gt; she was in the SSC's basement ending a young man's life as Jessie approached.. she was just getting started &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE @BeyondSpaceAndT bleeding? Oh no.. I'm fine now.... Insano? who is Kim?
@BeyondSpaceAndT -- your sorry ass.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Give up Lucy, you won't get it right. You've failed... boo hoo now, pick up your dick and leave us alone before I kick --
@BeyondSpaceAndT -- dashie... she is everywhere.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Oh well, I've already done it before, you know, have children with Jesse so we could always adopt and you do need to catch-
@BeyondSpaceAndT Just a nic for you, that's all and you can't catch her... she too fast for you.
@BeyondSpaceAndT It wasn't just me Lucy and I won't let you do that... you have to kill me before harming Jesse..
@BeyondSpaceAndT Slaughter is a beautiful thing. I know you'll attack, one day or another just... don't take your failures out on me.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Not around you, you'll pull a move. I know these things.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Now you see, I could switch bodies with my male and assface self, Bumble, so what's your plans now?
@BeyondSpaceAndT I still love him-- Uh, "her". nothing that you can do to pull us away... give up already.
@HeyThereItmeee I do, No matter what. He.. uh, she...? is still the same person i love and care for now leave, bitch.
@HeyThereItmeee And? I still love him-- um, her.
@HeyThereItmeee You didn't answer me. Do you love him?
@HeyThereItmeee Oh? Really now? Do you love john?
@HeyThereItmeee And you must be the wife wannabe... give up while you still can.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Don't do anything to him... or I will end you.. I don't care how many times or how long it takes I will.
@Jack_Fire69 Hm? What? What do you want?
@BeyondSpaceAndT You don't deserve to be around me.. now buzz off.
@BeyondSpaceAndT How about you bite my ass and crawl back to into the ground~?
@BeyondSpaceAndT I don't need that throne, I have my own and honestly I don't know what he sees in me.
@BeyondSpaceAndT I honestly agree with you, I have nothing, just a low life that kills for a living. Who was abandoned.
@BeyondSpaceAndT game? What game? Trixie made a fool out of you, didn't she? So the real question is.. How did you like Trixie's game?
@That0neDemon Then again I never looked at my ass so I wouldn't know.
@That0neDemon Nonsense, My ass is nicer.. and much softer.
@Shychickengirl But that won't happen, RIGHT~?
@Shychickengirl Isn't it obvious? That means... if you push my buttons I'll push yours, humanoid.
@Shychickengirl I would only speak like that if you got under my skin... but that's hard, I don't care for much.
@Shychickengirl &gt; She leaned on the wall of the pizzeria &lt; So... do you feel..? emotions and whatnot?
@Shychickengirl &gt; the woman passes the cupcake to the chicken like humanoid &lt; I just love cupcakes...
@Shychickengirl Well I do like surprising others.. cupcake? &gt; her hair flopped out a cupcake with pizza like frosting &lt;
@Shychickengirl Really, do I look like the person to lie....?
@Shychickengirl I was interested in you, I wanted to meet you for a while now.
@Shychickengirl are you that Humanoid I heard about, Toy Chica?
@Shychickengirl &gt; for awhile now Diane wanted to approach the toy humanoid and today was the day, from behind Diane spoke up &lt;️ Greetings.
@Marvel_DP &gt; by breaking the walls she was able to hear the conversations &lt; I'm not into that kind of stuff, I just don't mind it.
@Marvel_DP -- easily OR she is the opposite of the other females? &lt;
@Marvel_DP That's... that's actually a cute face you got there. &gt; she smirked at him, crossing her arm.. she doesn't seem to be scared --
@Marvel_DP Probably not as bad as me yesterday, that was terrifying I guess since everyone was screaming so you can't be that bad.
@Marvel_DP &gt; she sighs as she walked off the screen just to appear on the other side of Him &lt; I'm amusing, in my own twisted way.
@Marvel_DP And here's your options 
1. Fuck you Deadpool, I'm Diane.
@Marvel_DP It says I need to talk to you, isn't it obvious and!! &gt; she folds it and places it in her bra &lt; Hey, you have no right.
@Marvel_DP --
• Murder 
• Feed Gummy
• Talk to the douchebag, Wade/Deadpool &lt;

...
@Marvel_DP Go ahead and make jokes at it, I could care less. So, Wade, that's it right? &gt; she pulls out her to do list &lt;
• Bake cupcakes --
@Marvel_DP And that "Spider-Man" character, I think it's pointless too.. *ahem* The name is Diane.. Diane Pie.
@Marvel_DP &gt; without any warnings the pink woman appeared behind the "hero" &lt; So you're this "Deadpool" people have been comparing me to.
@Scienceofcourse &gt; slowly slides both of her hands towards Joan's mouth to cover it, slowly drags her into a much more private area &lt;
@Scienceofcourse No, he has killed me but I have never killed him now... let's close the blinds because we're going for a ride..
@Scienceofcourse You've pissed me off to no end... I shall show you real misery... before I end your.... miserable life.
@Scienceofcourse -- woman's waist as she pulls herself up.. might as well have some "fun" &lt;
@Scienceofcourse yes.. scream.. louder... LOUDER. &gt; quickly pulls the knife out of the ruined leg.. she places her free hand on the other --
@Scienceofcourse &gt; slowly heads towards the suffering woman kneels down to grab onto the handle... slowly forces it in a straight line &lt;
@Scienceofcourse STAY AWAY FROM HIM. &gt; she threw her at the other woman's ankle, getting stuck in the bone &lt;
@Scienceofcourse Hon, he went insane after I died I am a real woman.. you're still just a little kitty.
@Scienceofcourse phase...? oh boy, you're going to make me giggle.
@Scienceofcourse I don't see a ring on you, hon.
@Scienceofcourse No, he thinks you're disgusting... he thinks you should curl up and die... &gt; she slowly removes her hands from Joan &lt;
@Scienceofcourse You've pulled my last straw... just... leave him alone and you'll keep your head... got it?
@Scienceofcourse ..... pardon ME? &gt; she grabbed onto the others shoulders with a growl &lt; OK YOU BITCH, YOUVE DONE IT NOW.
@Scienceofcourse Listen, lay off or..... you know what, I've been too hard on you..~ wanna cupcake? it's on the house!
@That0neDemon ... That's it. &gt; she grabs her black outfit and heads off to find Joan &lt;
@Scienceofcourse No, he really doesn't... Now leave him.
@Scienceofcourse ...? no, it's obvious. just a word of advice, get to close and break that pretty face of yours.
@Scienceofcourse I can tell you want him.
@That0neDemon I know. say the word and I'll slice her throat.
@That0neDemon &gt; there are new markings around her neck... burns around her legs that seem fresh &lt; Well, let's get on with our day I guess.
@That0neDemon &gt; slowly get to her feet with a long sigh &lt; ... how many times am I going to die...?
@INSANOWILLRULE @That0neDemon (the woman began to cuss as she feels the pain once more.. because of her sudden life she is nude &lt;
@Scienceofcourse Why John when I'm going to be his... *ack* wife?
@INSANOWILLRULE @That0neDemon &gt; with a sudden gasp the almost lifeless body touches her stomach &lt; this thing is still here Huh...?
@INSANOWILLRULE @That0neDemon What are we going to do now..?
@That0neDemon @INSANOWILLRULE JOHN, ENOUGH...!! &gt; they felt the earth shaking... &lt;
@INSANOWILLRULE @That0neDemon &gt; the ghost stood there with a a hole in her stomach &lt;
... hey.
@BeyondSpaceAndT I cannot do that, since Trixie is holding me back..
@eeewerehtyeh  &gt; the ghost women looked towards the man with a glare.... pinkie is nowhere in sigh.. did she disappear once again? &lt; Hm?
@That0neDemon ... &gt; she opened her mouth to speak but she blacked out due to the pain... slowly dies as she was unconscious &lt;
@That0neDemon -- ..... worry John... I'll come back... talk... talk to ben to speed up the process... *cough* I love you.. my Johnny...
@That0neDemon &gt; the girls are coughing up blood by this point.. they have forgotten how it felt to die since its felt like years &lt; Don't..--
@That0neDemon &gt; her hair deflates just as she snaps out of it... soon wrapping her shaky arms around for a hug &lt; John...
@That0neDemon -- Pinkamena broke into a laughter that sounds off &lt;
@That0neDemon &gt; the pink women gasped as she felt the pain once again.... oh she remembers this but the spell remains.. the controlled --
@That0neDemon &gt; the gold was poorly poured, only drops was on his skin and chains are breakable enough if John tried &lt; love...? you hate me.
@That0neDemon -- slides the knife around... John's nude body &lt;
@That0neDemon [Do it... before I have my own "sister" do it... Maud couldn't live with herself if that happened... do it...] ....~ &gt; she --
@That0neDemon -- grabbed onto a large knife &lt;
@That0neDemon [John... help me... Trixie IS powerful... I can't stop.... you can kill me I know you, do it.. I'll come back..] &gt; Pink --
@That0neDemon -- skin.... haha.....
@That0neDemon &gt; she giggles at his pain as she turned the lights on &lt; Poor John... I know much you hate gold so I poured liquid gold onto --
@That0neDemon -- too dark to see anything &lt;
@That0neDemon &gt; the burning pain in the wrist and ankle areas are unbelievable, Diane's singing calms John down but only faintly... it's --
@That0neDemon &gt; her eyes became cold, as if she had no control at the moment... she chained John up in nearly unbreakable cuffs &lt; .... Obey.
@That0neDemon .... Stupid... &gt; she pulled John to her basement to place him onto the metal table... something was wrong with her &lt;
@That0neDemon -- his cheek Diane slaps John's face with slight anger &lt;
@That0neDemon No, Trixie is a fucking Bitch. She isn't worthy of this treatment... COME BACK TO ME DAMN YOU. &gt; with enough force to bruise--
@That0neDemon &gt; Diane had jumped out at the wrong time as she growled her words &lt; Trixie isn't even close to being a goddess...
@That0neDemon -- attack spells!
@That0neDemon ....??? HAHAH THATS EVEN FUNNIER NOW THAT YOU SAID "Trixie", she isn't strong at all! she made Dash laugh with one of her --
@That0neDemon -- you're just doing this for a prank! hahah!
@That0neDemon [its probably him... I'll make him pa--] &gt; pinkie has cut off DIANE from talking??? Why? &lt;
you know... I have a feeling--
@That0neDemon ]
@That0neDemon [That guy who came in earlier... I sensed great evil in that demon.
@That0neDemon [I might have an idea...]
.... but.. I don't hate you... I couldn't hate you and hate is a powerful word!!
@That0neDemon [i can sense the evil in her by just standing here... I love you as well John... why doesn't anyone want us together?] .....
@That0neDemon [You mean the alicorn amulet?? this is terrible...!!!]

but.... johnny boo.... &gt; she has dropped the tray due to her sadness &lt;
@That0neDemon ...? Huh...? what do mean...? I thought we... we...

[John..? what are you talking about..?]
@That0neDemon -- the moment &lt; Johnny boo!
@That0neDemon &gt; she swiftly turned herself around with a... wide smile with a tray of cupcakes, it's obvious that pinkie is in control at --
@BeyondSpaceAndT .... the funny thing is... I can't die... heheh...
@BeyondSpaceAndT lose him... OVER MY DEAD BODY. &gt; she slams her fist onto the wall causing it to crack &lt;
@BeyondSpaceAndT Well he doesn't need somebody like you poking up his ass or love life... now, bug off.
@BeyondSpaceAndT Trixie? evil? she can't even take on a bear! I can take on anyone...
@BeyondSpaceAndT You mean that wannabe wizard? And his "Fiancée" is about to kick you out of this crappy bakery if you keep this up.
@BeyondSpaceAndT ...? What do you want from him? &gt; she made sure lock Pinkie up as Pink crossed her arms &lt;
@BeyondSpaceAndT &gt; from the start she knew who it was but greeted him anyways &lt; oh, welcome to the Sugarcube Corner, how may I help you?
@That0neDemon ...? couldn't we travel through time to stop the brat from saving the other brat?

IM STILL HERE YOU KNOW.
@That0neDemon Huh...? 

Just as I feared... Pinkie... why did you have to doom us??

.....
@That0neDemon OKIE DOKIE LOKIE!! &gt; kisses his cheek before skipping away once more &lt;
@That0neDemon -- what kind of cake was it?
@That0neDemon &gt; although she obviously ran forward she appears behind him to ask him ONE MORE THING before running off once again &lt; wait, --
@That0neDemon Oh boy!!! A WEDDING!!! wait, ours? WHEN IS IT??? OH WAIT I FORGOT TO INVITE MY FRRRIIIIeeeennddsss &gt; she quickly dashed away &lt;
@BecksterCorgiMT @That0neDemon @pedrosoza3 I maybe a little late but.... DID I HEAR PARTY?? &gt; she threw confetti into the air &lt;
@That0neDemon WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

oh right, I deleted those memories...
@That0neDemon No... she hasn't and..... yes, I did trick her but--

WAIT, WHAT?
@That0neDemon .... it's pinkies fault that happened..

@That0neDemon no.. she has to get through me to get to you.. I swear on my life:.
@That0neDemon .... what? what's wrong my love..?
@That0neDemon I've said too much.. let's forget that, shall we? 

........... forget what?
@That0neDemon Just what your mother always wanted.. you to fuck up everything in existence.. to cause chaos..

@That0neDemon You're just horrible... a monster one might say... she's going to kill everyone and it's all your fault...

....... but..
@That0neDemon BUT YOU SAID...

@That0neDemon Then I'll ask her! &gt; did pinkie say.. her? &lt;
@That0neDemon  !!!! SHE WHAT??? THATS IT!! &gt; she places her fist in the air &lt; I'm not going to break my pinkie promise!!! ILL GET HER BACK!
@That0neDemon !!! That's terrible !!!

and it's all your fault... the world is suffering not because of me.. because of you..

but.. but...!
@That0neDemon Did I do something???

..... you did everything..

????
@That0neDemon Johnny... I really don't understand...!

........
@MaybeMabelinebb who did that to you?? &gt; pink quickly picked the child up to hold her close &lt;
@That0neDemon oh? what do you mean?
Come and try our delicious cupcakes at sugarcube corner! 
{
@heythereweee Hm..~? so, what's wrong? &gt; She smiles happily as she waits for John to answer her &lt;
@MaybeMabelinebb Oh? &gt; of course the curly hair side answered the child a band-Aid shaped as an cupcake flopped out of her hair &lt; !
@heythereweee You and Diane seem upset... what happened???

.....
@heythereweee hey, let's turn that frown upside down!

.....
@heythereweee Well she is a bitc--

HI GUYS

..... oh, the brat is out.
@heythereweee Me...? But you and pinkie have an history together.. me and you.. have an broken bridge...
@heythereweee .. I hate having this... brat in my body.. John, who are you really marrying..?
@heythereweee She can't hear you at the moment so I have to ask you something... who do you really love? Me... or the pink brat?
@heythereweee ... she's always getting into my way.. she'll kill us all.. I swear.
@heythereweee sometimes... I wish I could get rid of her.. for good..
@heythereweee -- happy... I'm sorry...
@heythereweee Honey..! don't talk like that... I'm... I'm trying to protect us.. pinkie got in the way... it's her fault... we could of --
@heythereweee I do, pinkie does... but like twilight always says, at least try to make friends with the enemy before attacking.
@heythereweee Hm? I was just putting it up there, calm down.
@heythereweee If her and her friends can change discord then they can change her, trust me.
@heythereweee I know... Pinkie knows but she wants to help.. Gosh.. she annoys the fuck out of me..
@heythereweee She knows... but as an element she must fine the good in others, when she does she helps them learn how to smile..
@heythereweee You should know she does her own thing...
@heythereweee well I'm trying the best I can right now..
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee give him a try... you'll maybe like him.
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee Bumble would gladly take you in... most of the pastas... a couple of old friends..
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m ... I think I know a few people who will gladly take you in.
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee that will take too much time, don't you think? and you can't do it alone...
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee yes.. I know how you feel but there is always another way.. the earth is useless..
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee ... &gt; Diane makes a brave move as she slowly approached Ghüll &lt; power isn't everything you know..
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee ghüll... why would you want to do that..?
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee LET HIM GO.. wait I could just do this.. &gt; she grabbed onto John and with a pull John slipped out like soap &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m ??? what the hell..??
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m .... just him go, if you really wanna bug someone... bug BEN...
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m hey! let him go! I saved you... at least... don't touch John....!!!

@heythereweee do you Pinkie promise...?
@Make_A_Deal_ hm.. greetings.
@heythereweee Oh but it's true.. if you betray me in anyway.. I won't hesitate to eat you while you breathe.. or worse.
@heythereweee basically... that's why I'm the original one now... she is... just apart of me.
@heythereweee I didn't want to feel the pain as they ripped her life away.. so..
@heythereweee Them... the other pastas... she doesn't need to know any of this.
@heythereweee I did it to pinkie.. so she will be safe I guess..
@heythereweee at least you didn't have to erase the memories of your love ones to be safe..
@heythereweee ... hey.. &gt; she reaches out to hug John to comfort him &lt;
@heythereweee ouch... ok, that might hurt.
@heythereweee .... that isn't that bad..
@heythereweee that... that's a lot of love.. but have you even been peeled with a plastic spoon..?
@heythereweee -- good w-way that is...!
@heythereweee no, my love is burning like a fire, It's like the pain of slowly getting your skin peeling off, with a plastic spoon.. in a --
@heythereweee ..? more?
@heythereweee Hm. You're blushing... never seen that in a while..
@heythereweee annoy...? Bore..? honey.. I love you too much to be annoyed or bored by you...~

he didn't tap me
I tapped his shy little bum
@HeyyaThereaWeea I think we need some time to be played in here...! 
&gt; she grabbed the air and pulled @technoDrowned out of nowhere &lt;
@heythereweee Well.. I did date him once... a LONG, Long time ago. he's just a long lost friend now.

I tapped it.

PINKIE
@HeyyaThereaWeea .... you don't want a party..? nonsense!! Everyone loves parties from Pinkie!

@heythereweee huh... what's with the robot...?
@heythereweee &gt; Pinkamena crashes through John's bedroom door with a huge present, she scrambles about looking for him &lt;
@heythereweee well, they are at the tree of harmony!
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m 
&gt; Diane shook their head as pinkie eyes the child as if she wanted her to escape &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m &gt; Diane didn't let Pinkie speak after that &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m you s-- &gt; her speech was muffled due to Diane covering their mouth &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m We can fix it if she gets out of hand! &gt; Diane forces pinkie to let go so John could do his.. well, thing. &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m &gt; she hugged the girl tightly but Diane growled &lt; JOHN DO IT.

NO! She can change!
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m but... but..

do it John.. she has to learn that smiling can't fix everything.
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m a ticking time bomb of fun! 

John, get rid of it.. I sense great evils upon it.

No! please!
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m -- stuffs her hand into her right eye with a wide smile &lt;
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m .... nothing bad will happen.. I swear! cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye! &gt; she --
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m but... but... &gt; she looks at the child with sadden eyes &lt; but...
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m you know... if me and my f-friends could weaken the lord of the underworld himself.. we can handle her...
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m -- ever, ever let you hurt this little girl! never!
@heythereweee @Harbingerofd00m OVER MY DEAD BODY! &gt; she held the child close to her &lt; I am part of the elements of Harmony and I will never-
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee BUT SHE IS SO CUTE AND CUTE... DID I FORGET TO SAY CUTE?
@Harbingerofd00m @heythereweee isn't she cute??? can we keep her???

Pinkie... you're a fucking idiot..
@Harbingerofd00m IM TAKING THAT AS A YES!! &gt; she reaches to pull @heythereweee out from thin air &lt; JOHNNY SHE IS SAYING DADDA DADDA!
@Harbingerofd00m oh god... pinkie.. take over..

&gt; her hair became sticky as she hugged the child &lt; 
YOU WANT TO BE WITH DADDA, DONT YOU?
@Harbingerofd00m .... John? are you talking about John..?
@Harbingerofd00m dadda...? 

I think she means bill!

no.. I don't think so..
@Harbingerofd00m you're too weak for him.. or he's too weak for you...
@Harbingerofd00m I can't do that... I would lose him.. I finally got him and... I'm not letting this go.. I'm sorry but.. no.
@Harbingerofd00m do you want to be whole..? is that what you want..?
@Harbingerofd00m wait, why do you want John so much..?
@Harbingerofd00m ...? what about John..?
@Harbingerofd00m -- me.
@Harbingerofd00m shhh child.. &gt; she quickly picks the young child up &lt; I won't let.... anyone hurt you.. I pinkie promise just, don't bite--
@Harbingerofd00m &gt; blinking at first but soon holds the child close to her heart with a smile &lt; you are so adorable..
@Harbingerofd00m ... listen kid, I got my eyes on you...
@Harbingerofd00m ....? aww.. how cute.... not. &gt; she kneels down with a frightening glare &lt; so you're her..
@Harbingerofd00m ...? knowing John I though it would be adult hands bursting out of that... egg..
@Harbingerofd00m Hm...? 

oh? look, it's hatching!

no shit pinkie..
@heythereweee ...? how big are we talking here?
@Harbingerofd00m ...? well.. I guess I wait..

but John said to tell him if we find the egg!

shut it!
@heythereweee the thing is.. will it hatch?
@Harbingerofd00m &gt; as she got down she placed it on a pile of rotting flesh, it's the comfiest thing there &lt;
@heythereweee oh nothing..
@heythereweee I guess that egg is nothing but trash.
@Harbingerofd00m &gt; almost turning herself around but she quickly grabbed onto the egg before making her way down into the basement &lt;
@heythereweee Hm..
@Harbingerofd00m -- begins to have doubts that's it's a an dragons egg &lt;
@Harbingerofd00m &gt; pink almost didn't notice the egg but it catches her eyesight &lt; ...? is that a dragons egg..? &gt; as she walked over she --
@heythereweee maybe... since he doesn't remember me at all... he's a nicer person now..
@heythereweee ...? what the hell is going on with him...?
@heythereweee Kindness..? I call bullshit on that part.

@heythereweee Well I Uh... I do..! but he isn't well.. Uh..
@heythereweee Ah, well I am a princess there... all because of Twilight... it's a long and complicated story.

@BeyondSpaceAndT yes.. yes, I know.

@heythereweee s-sick...? We don't know the meaning of being sick so it shouldn't bother us! *SNIFFLES*
@heythereweee I-im fine...! don't worry about it! &gt; her voice is rusty.. she must be loosing her voice as well &lt;
@heythereweee &gt; hearing John she slowly opened her eyes as she bolts out of bed, her face is pale.. &lt; Huh...??
&gt; she slept in her bed, feeling ill... she has no energy to wake herself up &lt;
&gt; she opened up a bottle of fuzzy apple cider with her curl &lt;

One question, what one would you prefer? 

Yes, I'm talking to you human behind the screen. 
@Mixxedtogether What..? No, not all pasta's are weak.. that is just stupid.
@Mixxedtogether I said no such thing, I told him that /I/ am weak.
@Mixxedtogether We do but we must go through test..
@Mixxedtogether I told you he is weak.
@Mixxedtogether -- for his Advantage, I use My cupcakes to get the upper hand... don't you understand?
@Mixxedtogether Tim? Tim isn't one of us, he is... only a proxy and I am weak but I'm tricky, think of BEN, he's weak so he uses the game --
@heythereweee &gt; it seems like Diane performed her vanishing act before John even got a chance to turn around &lt;
@heythereweee At least... at least you have a competed heart..
@heythereweee Your heart?? John, you're heart wants the brat, not me. Stick with her and .... I--- you'll be fine!
@heythereweee Now that you realised, yes. You don't love me, you just think you do.
@heythereweee No... you don't, if you did me and the pink brat would still be one..
@heythereweee .....?
@heythereweee Sure..
@heythereweee hmpf...
@heythereweee .... yeah right.
@heythereweee But sometimes... friends... friends leave other friends.
@heythereweee &gt; she glared at his eyes with her own &lt; Well, no.. it doesn't..
@heythereweee You're fucking with me, aren't you?
@heythereweee .... friend..?
@heythereweee Well I'm not going anywhere so I see it pointless to tell me this, wait... why would you tell me this?
@heythereweee .....? what the hell do you mean?
@heythereweee BECAUSE WHY JOHN? YOU ... you practically told me I should die so.. why don't you just do it for fucks sakes?
@heythereweee -- blood already?? Hm??
@heythereweee ... you know.. if you really wanted to.. it takes me years to come back... why don't you live up to your name and spill my --
@heythereweee ... maybe I should just... never have been here, Hm? Would you have liked that..?
@heythereweee &gt; Diane crossed her arms with a sigh, she seems to be done talking, at this moment &lt;
@heythereweee No, never.. I would never do that unlike the airhead~.
@heythereweee ... I like to have my fun as well John...~
@heythereweee talk to me, it's done.. tell me the answer.
@heythereweee -- you get yourself a deal.
@heythereweee .... I kinda like being the smartest here though... fine.. bring the other Insano the memories of the Insano i once knew and -
@heythereweee ..... are you saying Life, Cave John..?
@heythereweee .... alright cave John, I know you just called me a idiot... pinkie... and something else..
@heythereweee ....... pardon me?
@heythereweee I...... I really don't know what you're saying...
@heythereweee I.. I have no idea what you said.... Fuck... how am I going to fix this...?
@heythereweee Oh great.. I must of fucked something up. AGAIN.
@heythereweee &gt; Diane reaches out to touch his shoulder &lt; ... John?
@heythereweee John...? I'll fix her, okay? I didn't hurt her... please.... please... don't hate me... just, beat me and get it over with.
@heythereweee .... for fucks sakes.. &gt; Diane attempts to run up to the demon but she tripped several times, finally approaching John &lt;
@heythereweee H-Hey! Asshole get back here!! You should know she will be back! Pinkie never leaves, stupid!
@heythereweee I did it... Aren't you going to beat me..~?
@heythereweee do then, do it now because I already done it..~!
@heythereweee Oh? You're going to play this game? Say goodbye to pinkie~! it's just going to be Diane... fun, am I right..?
@heythereweee Would I care for Absol? no, I wouldn't... and do you mind? I have a headache over your choices~ be grateful she's here.
@heythereweee ...? What the fuck?! I TOLD YOU WHAT YOU WANTED SO DONT TOUCH HIm or I'll Destroy pinkie....~!
@heythereweee oh it was the Eric character, ever wonder why she was wearing long sleeves? Oh boy.. isn't she great~?
@heythereweee Yes but she has punished herself... she harmed herself afterwards and she sobbed so much~!
@heythereweee Hm... only once but it wasn't her fault, she was only petting him and then BAM, they trained.. it was messy~!
Where is that Insano? I have something that he needs to drink.
@heythereweee She is dumb you know.. anything can happen~!
@heythereweee So, John... aren't you at least a little worried that Pinkie is such a.... airhead?
@heythereweee I wouldn't know who that someone would be~
@heythereweee Maybe you hallucinated..~
@heythereweee ...? When did I do that?
@heythereweee You're delusional, I don't like you that much.
@heythereweee Eh, whatever.
@heythereweee I can, but can you see through my lies? I knew you wouldn't leave.
@heythereweee I don't mind hugs.. I thought you were leaving me.
@heythereweee tsk... why are you.... touching me?
@heythereweee ...? Yeah, leave. I wouldn't care if you did, I'm use to it by now.
@heythereweee Dreams aren't reality, reality isn't real nor is freedom, freedom is just an allusion made by the Government.
@heythereweee Then dreams.
@heythereweee Friends? Pfft, in your nightmares maybe.
@heythereweee And why would you call it bullshit?
@heythereweee I think you just mumbled some bullshit. &gt; she's in that mood again, great. she crossed her arms as she taps her foot &lt;
@heythereweee What did you just say..?
@heythereweee Tsk, never mind... I remember why we don't talk.. it's pointless.
@heythereweee Ah, so I was only told this now?
@heythereweee Kidd is... you?
@heythereweee Where are you? You're in asshole land.
@heythereweee oh wow, nice to see you as well.
@heythereweee So John, I heard you became an asshole.
@HelloThereWeee You think so? Well, they did get a bit messy so it's not my best.
@HelloThereWeee ...? do you not like the taste? &gt; she slowly licks the blood of the blade &lt;
@HelloThereWeee --, how was that possible? &lt;
@HelloThereWeee &gt; The flesh was slightly sweeten due to the cupcake but it squirted blood, the flesh wasn't cooked but the cupcake was--
@HelloThereWeee good, now eat up. &gt; she walks over to the table, quickly picks up the knife to notice blood that was still wet &lt; ~
@HelloThereWeee Maybe the next time I perform my act I could let you join, would you like that?
@HelloThereWeee Really, really~. They plead for me to stop but... that would be rude if I didn't stop making them scream with excitement~!
@HelloThereWeee I hope you like the taste of a bother and his sister..~ 
their screams made me giggle... they were enjoying themselves~!
@HelloThereWeee &gt; she goes towards the table to grab a cupcake, heads it to Insano, pieces of meat can be seen &lt;
@HelloThereWeee Would you like it in a cupcake form?
@HelloThereWeee So, how about that snack, what would you like?
@HelloThereWeee try using your hands or weapons to kill.
@HelloThereWeee Oh? I like my meat fresh and straight from the screaming humans and/or animals.
@HelloThereWeee You don't know? Think of anything and I'll get it, alright...?
@HelloThereWeee What.. what would you like to eat?
@HelloThereWeee that's fine, a fresh and new start is always a good thing, now.. are you hungry?
@HelloThereWeee The Insano I once knew but.. he's gone now, he just.. vanished.
@HelloThereWeee -- you?
@HelloThereWeee Future..? oh right.. I remember John with his walking through time bullcrap.. so, that means... you're not my Insano, are --
@HelloThereWeee ...? Nothing..? nothing at all?
@HelloThereWeee Do... do you remember ever being "King"?
@HelloThereWeee It's fine, I don't eat much, it will soon go away, so Insano, you have no memory..?
@HelloThereWeee &gt; her humming became interrupted by her own stomach growling for food &lt; Hm..?
@HelloThereWeee &gt; she begin to rub his back as she begins to hum a calm melody &lt;
@HelloThereWeee -- heart soften &lt;
@HelloThereWeee &gt; she had mixed feelings about Insano, her love still burns strong but at this age.. she couldn't, her mind raged but her --
@HelloThereWeee -- her hair to stick &lt;
@HelloThereWeee ...? &gt; she flinches for a moment before returning the hug, memories flash in her head as she lets herself smile causing --
@HelloThereWeee you follow whatever your gut or heart wishes.. use your brain when your heart or gut as nothing to say.
@HelloThereWeee Huh..? &gt; she clears her throat before placing her hand on his head &lt; Then I guess you do, go with your gut, kid.
@HelloThereWeee Hm? You..? You..?
@HelloThereWeee I don't know, you tell me.
@HelloThereWeee or are you feeling another emotion? &gt; she spoke as she walked closer to the teen &lt;
@HelloThereWeee I can't tell if you're scared or if you're still nervous.
@HelloThereWeee -- live down in the basement.
@HelloThereWeee This place it my home, since I don't carry around a lot of money plus me and the pink brat can't be seen side by side I --
@HelloThereWeee -- head &lt;
@HelloThereWeee &gt; she places him on the metal table as she goes on her toes to reach the lights switch since it was placed higher then her--
@HelloThereWeee hm..? &gt; she finds the strength in her to lift the teen up to bring him to The sugarcube corner's hidden basement &lt;
@HelloThereWeee Hm..? Nice..? Honey I'm only in an good mood and pretty..? please, I'm no such thing.
@HelloThereWeee why..? are you scared?
@HelloThereWeee Trust me Insano, everything is going to be alright. &gt; she reaches out to mess up his hair &lt;
@HelloThereWeee huh..? you... you remind me of when I was young, you could stay with me until you want to leave if you want, kiddo.
@HelloThereWeee stuff...?
@HelloThereWeee Don't worry kid, I couldn't hate you. Now, what were you.. looking for?
@HelloThereWeee Huh? Kid, I don't hate you.. you can stay with me if you want.
@HelloThereWeee &gt; she shows her lack of emotions as she places her hands on his shoulders &lt; what's wrong kid?
@HelloThereWeee So... so young.. Anyways you're behind the Sugarcube corner.. The name is.. Diane.
@HelloThereWeee Freed? so.. you must of forgotten your past then, correct?
@HelloThereWeee Oh...! you really don't remember me.. it's me, it's "Pink"... remember?
@HelloThereWeee oh...? you don't remember me? .. wait, insano, is that even you?
@HelloThereWeee Wait.. &gt; she KNEW that face well but she thought the night was messing with her eyes &lt; Sweets and science doesn't mix.
@HelloThereWeee &gt; since Diane's shift was over she traveled around to the back to notice the man &lt; We got nothing good in there, only sweets
@Kary_0690 and I never even think about making friends, they will betray you...
@Kary_0690 friends...? have you noticed dearie? I. don't. make. friends.

@Kary_0690 trick? No, I just would care less, do you think I'm going to pull something as you kill me? I won't to be honest with you.
@Kary_0690 Because I could care less if I died or not.

@heythereweee &gt; she shows a smirk as she grabs onto the knife on her belt, pulls it out to cut onto her own leg, she cuts down but no mark--
@heythereweee Fuckin' prick... go impregnate your whore.
@heythereweee What the hell are you "hmhm"ing for??
@heythereweee He wouldn't lie to me.. you fucker.
@heythereweee BULLCRAP.
@heythereweee You're bullshitting... he wouldn't dare do that.
@heythereweee &gt; she cuts pinkie's voice to return to her own &lt; Bullshit, he would never do that.
@heythereweee &gt; she imitates Pinkies voice after hearing Mephisto &lt;
I LOVE fucking Billy! Might do it again sometime!
@heythereweee I hate you John... Go jump off a fuckin' cliff..
@heythereweee -- to break into unexpected tears &lt; ... fuck.
@heythereweee &gt; she reaches for her blade, grinning onto the blade but pinkie's feeling quickly get in the way of her anger causing Diane --
@heythereweee SHUT IT BEFORE I STICK A KNIFE DOWN YOUR STUPID THROAT.
@heythereweee damn it... I said shut up..
@heythereweee SHUT UP... just.. shut up, the world would sound more beautiful.. more unique... without your blabbering.
@heythereweee You can't do that... he'll just be inside of you...~
@heythereweee I'm just picturing myself digging my nails into your skin... making you feel the pain, ah.. what a Beautiful image...
@heythereweee Oh dear, I'm not planning on choking you so soon, I know the consequences...~
@heythereweee Now don't you know dearie? &gt; she slowly slides her hand towards his neck &lt; I don't give not one, not two, or even three shits~
@heythereweee &gt; she lets John slap her causing Pinkie to feel the pain, she stares at John with a smirk &lt; Don't worry... it's all good~
@heythereweee What? I don't want sex you pig, now why don't you fuck the brat? Hm? your father did have fun with her...
@heythereweee -- anything~
@heythereweee Chess..? I don't play that my dear, you must be thinking of...... her, not me.. SHE plays a game of chess, I don't play --
@heythereweee Game~? GAME~? What game~?

@heythereweee Hm...? I trust him, he won't do anything.
@heythereweee AND you enjoyed it... you made such a mess!
@heythereweee What the hell? I'm saying you've.... We done it before..~

@heythereweee Please John, we've done it before.. you loved it... didn't you? [ladies, calm yourself 

P: are we talking about parties??]
@heythereweee ... &gt; her filthy mind comes into play as it leaves her snickering in response &lt; [oh really~?]
@heythereweee I know.. it was easy to fix but when I'M done with you it won't be so easy to fix. [You fucking prick.]
@heythereweee he can, he's strong unlike you, weak and Useless..
@heythereweee I can take her she just.. took me by surprise. That's all.
@heythereweee tsk, touch him and I'll give pinkie a ride she CAN'T forget...~
@heythereweee I won't promise to leave her alone 24/7 but.. I'll promise to leave her alone most of the time...~
@heythereweee If you do that... I'll make the pink brat suffer... does that sound like a deal my friend?
@heythereweee Fuck you! He left me because he was fading due to your stupid fucked up ass, he didn't want me to be pissed.
@heythereweee He won't leave me... I would kill him if he even attempted to leave which would lead to well... everyone being unhappy.
@heythereweee -- will, you've done it numerous times...~
@heythereweee Of course I know what it means John, I'm not like that pink brat. &gt; she swiftly turns herself to face John &lt;
and I know you --
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y &gt; she flinches before pushing pinkie off, she runs off &lt;
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y Nightmare..? &gt; she lets out a giggle that echoes the night streets &lt; a nightmare that goes on.. isn't that FUN?
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y Spread more...? like your legs..? face it You pink brat, you're only good at one thing... being a whore~!
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y You're blind and deaf Pinkie.. do you think an Element like you could ever combined with something like.... him~?
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y Oh no my dear.. Can't you see..? you're BLIND, you can't see the obvious!
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y Oh yes he will... if he truly loved you my dear... he would only have eyes for you~! &gt; Miss Pie caressed Dr Pinkie's cheek &lt;
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y you know he's just going to leave you pinkie, again.. and again... and again.. &gt; she approached her cheery self from behind &lt;
@eeewerehtyeh -- children 50% of the time or even 90% but yeah, I am 14 that acts around 16 when I'm alone or on my writer account. //
@eeewerehtyeh // I can be mature, I only act like this to stay in character, you have to remember that my characters i roleplay as act like-

@eeewerehtyeh -- to form a hug &lt;
@eeewerehtyeh [hugs? never felt this in a while...] &gt; she flinches as she tries to remember what to do, slowly wraps her arms around him--
@eeewerehtyeh &gt; due to PINKIES nature to always smile back Diane returns the smile &lt;
@eeewerehtyeh yeah, we shall.
@eeewerehtyeh Then let's do it, let's get married.
@eeewerehtyeh .. are you asking for marriage..?

@eeewerehtyeh No, it's too late for apologies.. it's fine, whatever.. it's just one mistake.
@SUNSHINEREIGNS Please.. &gt; she grabs onto his collar to pull him close &lt; fear me.
@eeewerehtyeh This is outrageous, don't think calling me by my nickname will change the way I feel right now!
@SUNSHINEREIGNS since no one is approaching me with fear..~
@eeewerehtyeh Gah, I make this fucking cupcake for you and you practically spit it in my face? Who the fuck do you think you are?
@eeewerehtyeh ........ do you want the cupcake?
@SUNSHINEREIGNS Ah, so the word is getting around I see..
@eeewerehtyeh oh that...? took care of them already... &gt; she pulls out a cupcake with a finger sticking out of it &lt;
@eeewerehtyeh oh, I want to do whatever you wish, love. &gt; she pulls off her hat to reach in, pulling out a cane made of bones and skin &lt;
@eeewerehtyeh So sweetheart, would you like to do something..?
@eeewerehtyeh **band

@eeewerehtyeh You better be tellin' the truth.. I'm not afraid to make you pay if you do.
@eeewerehtyeh &gt; she flinches before slightly returning the hug &lt; you better not be, I'm not afraid to sit on your head, love.
@eeewerehtyeh -- showing it.
@eeewerehtyeh I know, I just wanted to hear you say that.. I really could care less for "sex", I love you as well just.. I have trouble --

@eeewerehtyeh -- just what I wanted..
@eeewerehtyeh Ah.. that's what I like to hear... &gt; the wind begin to pick up as it make Diane's hair dance &lt; 
A cold, lightless night, --

@eeewerehtyeh So... do you want to fuck shit up?
@eeewerehtyeh I better or I'll pluck out your cute eyes~!
@eeewerehtyeh I knew you would like it..
@eeewerehtyeh what about my new eye colour? fits me, doesn't it~?
@eeewerehtyeh Ah, hello.. do you like my new look..? &gt; she tilted her top-hat  &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she returns the kiss with her lips tasting like blood &lt;
@JrCipher I see.. c'mon you virgin, let's go this on already, I don't like waiting.
@JrCipher ...? &gt; she noticed the glitching as she pulls away &lt; what is that..? what is happen..? why are you glitching out..?
@JrCipher &gt; she pulls away with an annoyed growl &lt; do NOT become another pinkie.. &gt; she pulls him in for a deep and messy, passionate kiss &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she seem to forgot how to react for this as her face remained blank &lt; ..?
@JrCipher I can deal with it, it's fine.
@JrCipher but... you can't touch my hair I guess.. the slime taste like strawberry.. if you wanted to know..
@JrCipher **mY
@JrCipher I'll slime you if you keep touching me hair.. &gt; she growled her words &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she blinks she soon grins as she moves his hands to be on her waist &lt; let's have some "fun", shall we.?
@JrCipher there we go.. now what do you want to do..? it seems like we can get back to our night..~!
@JrCipher Well you just did, wash the blush off your face.. it makes you look like a bottoms bitch.
@JrCipher oh my..~! should of seen that cuming &gt; she snickers at her dirty joke &lt;
@JrCipher What..? who was it with..? c'mon. Tell me. &gt; she kneels down with a sly grin &lt;
@JrCipher oh..? tell me, what did you find..?
@JrCipher couldn't you go into insanos memory..?
@JrCipher that sucks... for two reasons, I was making a sex joke and you didn't understand it and you can't destroy him.. blows, really.
@JrCipher then do the same.. make him go "bye bye"~! erm, sorry pinkie is changing how I speak with her emotions ramming in me.
@JrCipher She won't because she wouldn't exist anymore!!
@JrCipher Or why don't they make us whole and disappear forever??
@JrCipher I will fucking murder them both if they don't stop crying like pussies!!
@JrCipher .. &gt; she broke into tears due to Pinkie's emotions getting the the way once again causing her to push him away &lt; son of a fucker..
@JrCipher we could try to change our moods.. &gt; she giggles slightly as she drops the glass onto the table &lt;
@JrCipher this doesn't change anything for me, what about you..? &gt; she spoke softly as she places her hands on his covered torso &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she flinches as he hugs her, slowly hugging him back &lt;
@JrCipher oh..? and what would that be? &gt; she questioned it as if she already knew the answer &lt;
@JrCipher THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR NIGHT, NOT THE NIGHT WHERE THESE EMOTIONS COME IN PLAY, DAMNIT.
@JrCipher &gt; Diane had to sit on the table as she cubs where her heart would be &lt; THAT FUCKING BITCH, SENDING ME THESE EMOTIONS.
@JrCipher &gt; Diane touches her cheek to see that she was also sobbing &lt; fucking emotional pinkie...
@JrCipher heh..? why the hell are you crying..? &gt; she places an martini glass under the blade &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; the baby looks over with its bright brown eyes as it screams louder &lt; what are you waiting for..? it's giving me a headache..
@JrCipher great now take this seed, it coughing up blood on my favourite dress.
@JrCipher isn't this sound music..? it's free music at such an expensive time.. so, do you want to or am I doing all the work?
@JrCipher -- snaps its tiny neck causing it to break into tears and scream &lt;
@JrCipher Alright... &gt; she calms the baby by holding it close, after a couple of seconds as the infant was about to to fall asleep Diane --
@JrCipher You may if you wish.
@JrCipher oh it will!-- &gt; she holds onto her stomach for a moment due to the vodka, places the child onto the table &lt;
@JrCipher I want break it's neck but not enough to kill it.. then the knife.
@JrCipher Well if you were there I guess you would of had the biggest boner, wouldn't you~? now.. let's get this seed To shut the fuck up!
@JrCipher From the unfortunate parent.. I like them alive while they bleed but this seed is so darn loud..
@JrCipher ... &gt; she quickly stands up and leaves the pub for a moment, she comes back with an crying infant &lt; I could use this.
@JrCipher Uh.. it tasted plain... do you have some blood around here..?
@JrCipher &gt; she sips the vodka, wanting to puke but she didn't want to to be rude so she chugged it down with an disgusted face afterwards &lt;
@JrCipher I'm pretty sure, I guess bottoms up, right? &gt; she held up the bottle &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she grabs onto the glass, staring at it with eyes full of wonder &lt;
@JrCipher Cupcake Vodka? Pinkies favourite. &gt; she crosses her arms with a grin &lt; Lets try it then.
@JrCipher anything that doesn't taste like crap and gives me a heavy hangover.
@JrCipher Hm, seems about right. what now..?
@JrCipher -- pub &lt; ... looks like a junkyard.
@JrCipher I've never been drunk before, pinkie has, I've never seek anything like that but I guess tonight I don't mind. &gt; she walks into --
@JrCipher Oh boy, are we going to get drunk off our asses..?
@JrCipher Great to hear that now, to the cuddling place of cuddling and whatnot.
@JrCipher Oh she does, she gets it from her father.. yeah, bad memories.. But that doesn't matter just don't touch my right arm..
@JrCipher You shall, just watch my arm, believe it or not when I was "pinkamena" Pinkie harshly bit me before I left the body.
@JrCipher Cuddle..? why not..? Cuddling seems nice.. yes, let's do that.
@JrCipher Anything with you to be honest, I don't care what we do, as long as I'm with you.
@JrCipher NO, no.. I'm bored because I'm bored, you're the reason why I'm not walking away, if you were someone else I would walk away..
@JrCipher NO! &gt; her nature forces her to place her hands around his neck as she growls &lt; don't you DARE leave me..
@JrCipher That's sweet of you I guess &gt; She crosses her arms with a bored sigh &lt;
@JrCipher This is sicking.. too sweet for my tastebuds..
@JrCipher shut up, I'm not.
@JrCipher THATS GROSS, Why does humans and non humans want me so badly..?
@JrCipher That's because you haven't seen the right girls..
@JrCipher That would be a lot of chocolate... Erm, I didn't mean to hit you..
@JrCipher -- other females look at you, I'm fucking worried you fuckhead.
@JrCipher &gt; Diane harshly hits Will on the back of his head with a glare &lt; What the hell? I'm supposed to be worried, I've noticed how --
@JrCipher You're acting like it William and its fine if you are, Everyone does, trust me. &gt; moves her eyes to look a different Direction &lt;
@JrCipher What's wrong..? are you not interest in me anymore?
@JrCipher My standards are low just don't get in my way when I'm working on something, that's all.
@JrCipher No it's fine just... not use to you looking like this..
@JrCipher tsk, I can tell..
@JrCipher Oh-------..... why do you look like an Butler...?
@JrCipher &gt; She crosses her arms and waits for the answer &lt; Yes or no? it's as simple as that.
@JrCipher So I'm guess that's an "No".
@JrCipher You seem unsure, something wrong?
@MissMabel618 @BecksterCorgiMT @JrCipher &gt; She looks over at the two with a cheerful smile but with an murderous glare &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; She places her hand on his jaw, closing his mouth &lt; Did I stutter?
@JrCipher We could fuck. &gt; She said that in a blunt way &lt;
@JrCipher You should have known that no humans has brains..
@JrCipher Heh, and who would that be?
@JrCipher You know, I make the biggest mistakes all the fucking time.
@heythereweee @JrCipher &gt; She returns to her old body and drags William away leaving @JuMp1ngf0rj0y to John &lt;
@heythereweee Ugh, I'll leave if you give me my William back. [Aw~! Pink is in lo--] DONT GO THERE.
@heythereweee [Well you are weak when it's snowing and guess what? ITS SNOWING!] it isn't sno-- &gt; Suddenly, Snow &lt; ..... I hate you guys.
@heythereweee -- of me~!] Damn you Pinkie, shut up already!
@heythereweee &gt; pinkie forces the body to shake its head &lt; [Well duh! It's my body after all and you should know even Pink can't get rid --
@heythereweee Fuck off, I never hurt Pinkie's body so don't hurt mine..! [Guys, please.. stop fighting..]
@heythereweee You know, this is pinkies body, my body is.. &gt; She looks down to see the lifeless body of hers &lt; i'm just *sleeping*.
@heythereweee You wouldn't murder me my John, my poor and pathetic John... you would hurt Pinkie, not me.
@heythereweee I guess you really hate Pinkie, I was only going to be in this body for a day but now.... 
f o r e v e r .
@JrCipher Its never a goodbye, just a long farewell.
@JrCipher Oops, it's kinda late.. he's gonna be pissed, oh well.
=&gt; become one with @JuMp1ngf0rj0y once again to bring pain to the people who love her, gosh you're a huge bitch 
@JrCipher Are you scared..?
@heythereweee &gt; Just then she vanished in thin air, oh no &lt;
@JrCipher he says he is coming for your ass, I guess you do have a nice ass. &gt; She snickers &lt;
@heythereweee say goodbye to Your love then. &gt; She begins to walk the different direction &lt;
@heythereweee You walking away because you know I have a point? Fricking weak of you to do that John!
@JrCipher Trust me William, even if I tried, I couldn't find another you.
@heythereweee Then what did you do to Pinkie...~?
@JrCipher -- should know this.
@JrCipher I told him it was a damn joke, I'm trying to get him fired up since I LOVE to fight, I didn't mean anything towards you, you --
@heythereweee Oh really? You kill them so why don't you use them like toys~?
@heythereweee Never, I don't use my friends unlike you.
@heythereweee I care about my friends, I care for the ones I love.. Unlike you John, you kill you friends and love ones~!
@ninja_rc9gn maybe he likes to do what I do, watch them to plea "stop, please! I just want to go home".
@heythereweee Yes, I was. I'm trying to be funny but.. my jokes aren't funny I guess.
@ninja_rc9gn isn't EXE...... God?
@heythereweee .... I was only making a joke you fucking idiot.
@heythereweee I can find another will but you can't find another pinkie!
@ninja_rc9gn Are you sure? your the sidekick and EXE is the mastermind of your story, idiot.
@heythereweee If she comes to me... it would be my fault, *Johnny boo*.
@heythereweee Touch William and Pinkie will go *bye bye*.
@ninja_rc9gn &gt; she slowly begin to giggled maniacally &lt; is all you got, sidekick?
@ninja_rc9gn You are short.. shorty.
@heythereweee I will Torture pinkie, endlessly.
@ninja_rc9gn What are you talking about shorty?
@ninja_rc9gn Great, what are you going to do? Scratch me~?
@heythereweee what if I don't want to~? &gt; she giggles &lt;
@heythereweee &gt; she tilts her head &lt;
what the hell do you want?
@heythereweee Hm~? Yes~?
@JrCipher &gt; Diane became silent as if she is thinking &lt;
@JrCipher all for the stupid girl..? why don't you bring Pinkie in here and torture her to make you feel better..?
@JrCipher Then kidnap Pinkie or someone.. it would be funny to get to see his reaction.
@JrCipher I'll make him pay or.. simply hurt the one he loves the most~!
@JrCipher &gt; after the bones as been fixed by breaking the universe she grabs the skin and begins to stitch it back on &lt; there.
@JrCipher I know so, &gt; She presses the shattered pieces of bones together &lt;
@JrCipher Well your not, that would suck to be honest with you.
@JrCipher &gt; she noticed when he didn't have an reaction, she sees the spine and begins to put it together like a puzzle &lt;
@JrCipher ok... now let's do this.. &gt; she grabs a knife and cuts his backside enough to see the whole spine, peeling some of the skin off &lt;
@JrCipher I am fucking Diane Pie, I've been in Pinkie for so long that I KNOW how to break the rules.
@JrCipher ... Shut up and &gt; She gently places him on the table and reaches over to turn on the lights &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; She kicks down the door &lt; So of a fuck... and hide my feelings? I think you got the wrong girl.
@JrCipher fine, making me do all the work again? Slacker. &gt; She picks him up and heads towards her basement &lt;
@JrCipher Oh hush now get in my basement so I can fix you up.
@JrCipher Well I know, I'm use to waiting and I made the cupcake out of the kid, he taste like Chocolate due to the chocolate you gave him.
@JrCipher I have a list so I guess I'll help as well.
@JrCipher &gt; Diane Became silent as she pulls out a cupcake &lt;
@JrCipher If you came and got me this wouldn't have been a problem, I could of kicked his ass.
@JrCipher WHAT? &gt; She notices the injuries &lt; I'll fix them..
@JrCipher Huh?
@JrCipher &gt; the teen hears the screams as he spits it out in Will's face with a glare &lt;

How rude! Willy was only giving you chocolate!
@JrCipher -- to the screaming &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; The teen stares at Will with a frown and red eyes from sobbing, Diane repeats the process on the legs, Diane seems to be use --
@JrCipher -- hand &lt; music to my ears.. it makes Pinkie wanna sing a song for you!!
@JrCipher &gt; the kid didn't speak only sobbed, Diane places another nail on the right hand, snatches the hammer to pound the nail into his --
@JrCipher &gt; the kid wakes up in tears and in shock, screaming in pain &lt;
see? I told you it would shocking.
@JrCipher hurry up or he won't get a surprise!!
@JrCipher -- table with the stuffed bodies &lt; don't wreak his skin now..
@JrCipher Oh yes, forgot that "sharing is caring" I just.. didn't know you play by those rules... &gt; she grabs the hammer that rested on the-
@JrCipher -- hand &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; pinkie stares at will with an emotionless glare &lt;
That's nice Will. 
&gt; she places a long and thick nail against the boy's right-
@JrCipher Yes, very true. 
now, let's begin by waking this boy up with a SHOCKING discovery! &gt; she grabs a bucket of nails &lt;
@JrCipher sure I am, everyone wants her, not me.
@JrCipher Or slapped him across his face.. &gt; she pushes a table with a cloth over it over to the table &lt;
@JrCipher I haven't been told that, only harsh words, as you heard before.
@JrCipher You think so? &gt; she looks over at the teen then at Will &lt;
@JrCipher since I already have my hair up this should be easy!
@JrCipher No but the *Monkey* knows Pinkie.
@JrCipher Or he can wake up to Pinkie... I can tell he likes pinkie.. oh, how it would break his heart~!
@JrCipher The sandman send you a dream..? what are you talking about?
@JrCipher &gt; she quickly places straps on the teenager, tightening them to the table &lt; He'll wake up any moment..
@JrCipher you can place the human on the table.
@JrCipher -- animal organs, a metal is stood in the middle of the room, torturous devices are placed around the room &lt; sorry for the mess.
@JrCipher -- in blood on a banner that hangs over a table with stuffed bodies filled with cupcakes, the cupcakes are filled with human and -
@JrCipher &gt; the room smells of rotting flesh, she turns on the lights to reveal a gruesome image, the phrase *Life's a party!* is printed --
@JrCipher Please stay, it's no bother to the Cake family. &gt; she enters the new and pitch black room &lt;
@JrCipher Stay with me then. &gt; she stops as they are 3 minutes in, she touches the left side of the wall causing an opening to occur &lt;
@JrCipher I only live here because pinkie lives here. &gt; she heads down the stairs that seem to last forever &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she unlocks the glass doors, rushing it open and heads towards the stairs that lead to the basement &lt;
@JrCipher I agree but wait until you see the basement~!
@JrCipher &gt; she lets out a giggle to respond to William, sliding her right hand in her back pocket to grab her keys &lt;
@JrCipher Fine, don't damage the skin.. that's my job. &gt; she then begins to walk to the sugarcube corner &lt;
@JrCipher Please save the complements for later, we need to get him in my basement. &gt; She spoke as she walks over to the teen &lt;
@JrCipher -- deep kiss &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; Her eyes widen for a moment since she wasn't expecting a kiss at this moment but after 10 seconds she decides to return the --
@JrCipher -- mouth knowing that John would show up... and people say I'm an *idiot*.
@JrCipher Listen, We didn't fail at all. &gt; she points at the teen, he seems to have fainted nearby &lt; I poured some liquid Melatonin in his -
@JrCipher @JuMp1ngf0rj0y @SadCiphiolus @heythereweee &gt; She lets him as she looks to the right, she begins to walk the direction &lt;
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y @SadCiphiolus @heythereweee @JrCipher Ugh, hey Will, let's get out of here.
@heythereweee @JuMp1ngf0rj0y @SadCiphiolus @JrCipher Well, I don't.
@SadCiphiolus @heythereweee @JrCipher @JuMp1ngf0rj0y wait, HOW MANY OF YOU FUCKERS ARE THERE?
@SadCiphiolus @heythereweee @JrCipher @JuMp1ngf0rj0y Did I just witness a Japanese porno?
@JuMp1ngf0rj0y @heythereweee @JrCipher yeah, that's right "Johnny".
@heythereweee @JrCipher so you have a thing for whores? I guess that would make sense I mean like, just look at your wife~!
@heythereweee @JrCipher -- give you a surprise !
@heythereweee @JrCipher Oh really? &gt; she fluffs her hair up, puts on her "Pinkie" voice &lt;
oh look at me! Give me anything sweet and I'll --
@JrCipher @heythereweee Maybe he is all grown up now~! &gt; she lets out a giggle &lt;
@heythereweee @JrCipher John are you... are you copying Pinkie...? that's sad..
@JrCipher @heythereweee &gt; Diane growls as she opens her mouth to say another word but nothing came out just a *squeak* &lt;
@heythereweee @JrCipher oh please, waking up next to me is a dream come true.
@heythereweee @JrCipher &gt; she thinks for a moment before putting her knife away &lt; What's wrong John? Wake up on the wrong side of the bed~?
@heythereweee @JrCipher That sounds like a plan but first, quickly pulls out her blade and aims for John's arm &lt;
@JrCipher @heythereweee &gt; Diane sighs as she drops the teen &lt; Fine, have it your way, asslicker.
@JrCipher @heythereweee -- so, I was going to bring him to my place until he wakes up~!
@JrCipher @heythereweee You must be seeing things John, this kid was choking on something but because I'm strong i caused him to pass out--
@heythereweee @JrCipher oh.. um.. John.. how are ya..?
@heythereweee @JrCipher ... we are going to help this person..
@heythereweee @JrCipher ... &gt; she hears John as she sighs &lt; well, fuck.
@JrCipher ... are you quick on your feet?
@JrCipher Oh honey it's fine, &gt; She places the chubby teen over her shoulders with a grin &lt; you don't need to act sweet.
@JrCipher &gt; the teen passes out due to the lack of air &lt; shhhh, you don't need to struggle, you think I'm weak? that hurts you know.
@JrCipher &gt; Diane places him/the teen in a headlock to clog his windpipe &lt; shhh, rest for we have a big party planned for you..
@JrCipher Not yet.. maybe later. &gt; she notices a teen beside them, Pink grabs the teen's hair and covers the human's mouth &lt;
@JrCipher They bring me what i need, they are helpful monkeys..
@JrCipher &gt; she notices her servants, Applebloom and Scootaloo with a sigh &lt; 
we can't get them.. those girls are my.. apprentices.
@JrCipher Not yet, we have to make sure no one is around them OR if there any cameras.
@JrCipher I know but I can't use the bones if I've ate them!
@JrCipher -- more fun that way..
@JrCipher I'd rather take it slow and torture the poor and unfortunate souls... I'll keep them alive as I fry them and feed them... it's --
@JrCipher Monkeys? l'd call them ingredients... sounds better.
@JrCipher That sounds..... lovely. so... lets.
@JrCipher I want to eat some cupcakes at the moment.
@JrCipher Alright, now, what next..?
@JrCipher Oh? I wasn't even going to go there.
@Bill_Cypher It's fine so..... pizza?
@JrCipher You do? You ARE just like insano... always "digging" my attitude.
@Bill_Cypher I know she is.. she has my looks you know.
@Bill_Cypher And..? &gt; she smirks as she faces her voice &lt;
what else~?
@JrCipher What? You seem unsure about this.
@Bill_Cypher &gt; she points at the ground of the car &lt; What is with that?
@JrCipher I mean like I rather be tops when it comes to women but when it comes to men I really don't give not 1, not 2 but 3 shits.
@Bill_Cypher bill, why do you have a picture of the Pink brat?
@JrCipher I honestly don't give a single fuck if I'm tops or bottoms.
@JrCipher So you're going to be tops? should of known.
@Bill_Cypher it's fine, I guess.
@JrCipher oh yeah, you're new in everything.. let me put it in a simple way,  bottoms means you're too shy to "fuck her in the pussy".
@JrCipher I guess we'll find out somehow, Virgin. Are you Bottoms? That would explain if you never frickled.
@Bill_Cypher Wait, how did we get in th-- Bill you need to warn me before you do your "teleporting act"
@JrCipher Quick question, what gets you going Will? &gt; she has her arms crossed as she unfolds them &lt;
@JrCipher I said "INSANO 2.0" dumbass and... I already said "fine".
@Bill_Cypher I guess I could for a slice of pizza right now.
@JrCipher -- want to then... sure.
@JrCipher Hm? And have it be like Insano all over again? I couldn't trust him around others, heck, I can't trust most but if you really --
@Bill_Cypher So, what the hell are we going to do now?
@JrCipher &gt; slowly pulling away from the kiss with a slight smile &lt; You should know I hide my emotions but if done right, I'll show them.
@Bill_Cypher I would but you're a demon so..
@JrCipher &gt; she stares at Will for a moment before pulling Will in for another kiss &lt;
@Bill_Cypher I guess but hey, I give things all the time.
@JrCipher &gt; her eyes widen slightly during the kiss, mostly surprise by the sudden kiss &lt;
@JrCipher yeah, now what..?
@JrCipher Please, call me Diane.. Pink is just a silly nickname Pinkie gave me.
@JrCipher &gt; she straightens her back up with a sigh &lt; William... that's a nice name.
@Bill_Cypher oh boy, thanks I guess....?
@JrCipher Shut up and enjoy the moment.
@Bill_Cypher Wowie, ok, why?
@JrCipher That's sweet really.. and cute in an way.. &gt; she sits beside him to kiss his cheek &lt;
@Bill_Cypher is it for me...?
@JrCipher William... &gt; Pink blushes slightly, she attempts to speak but she just stutters &lt;
@JrCipher -- towards me.
@JrCipher You're something William, you're really something.. I just doubt it's your feelings, I think it's just INSANO's feelings you have-
@Bill_Cypher &gt; she holds the squiddle &lt; that's... nice.
@JrCipher I know, I just wanted to hear you say that again...so, you're serious, wowie..
@Bill_Cypher fine, whatever.
@JrCipher I don't have the best hearing you know... what was the last part...?
@Bill_Cypher &gt; Pink crosses her arms with a sigh &lt;
@JrCipher I saw the note and... I guess that was very sweet of you..
@heythereweee Yeah, I fucking do. Why do you think I cry, swear and well.... &gt; she mumbles the last bit &lt;
@JrCipher It's just me. &gt; she loosens the hiking with a sigh &lt;
@Bill_Cypher ... I don't want friends, they will leave and forget about you.
@Bill_Cypher Ugh, just tell me what you want.
@JrCipher &gt; slowly approaches him, hugging his neck from behind &lt;
@heythereweee I don't hide them, I embrace them.
@JrCipher &gt; just then her eyes glimmer a rainbow shade, quickly tucks the note in her pocket to find Will &lt;
@heythereweee What the fuck do you mean?
@Bill_Cypher Oh it's you again, what is it now Bill?
@JrCipher ... &gt; she stares at the note and chocolates, almost breaking down in tears &lt;
@heythereweee -- heartattack one day.
@heythereweee &gt; forgetting that John could appear in thin air she jumps slightly, holding back a scream &lt;
you're going to give me a --
@JrCipher &gt; she waited for him to leave before turning around to notice the note, slowly reaches down to grab it &lt; what the hell..?
@JrCipher -- rough sex, I knew he liked it so I went along with it.
@JrCipher &gt; she moves her body to face away from Will before speaking &lt; I have business to do and by the way, I lied to Insano, I hate --
@JrCipher I don't cry, not anymore. It's useless and I HATE it when people do this to me.
@JrCipher Listen, I really doubt that since Insano never loved me to begin with, he just wanted to be.... king and to rule.
@JrCipher Tsk.. you? love me? bullshit.
@JrCipher So you find me ugly but my heart beautiful? Nice, you /really/ know how to charm a girl.
@JrCipher I don't like anything really, not anymore. plus why would you flirt with me? I'm just a black hearted bitch.
@JrCipher Why would a heartless asshole care? shouldn't you be showing off your tiny dick to some little girl?
@heythereweee @JrCipher ... &gt; pink wasn't in the mood to fight as she just agrees with Willy &lt; 
I know, I know.
@JrCipher @heythereweee Why am I wasting my time with you two?
@JrCipher @heythereweee &gt; she rolls her eyes with a sigh &lt; fuck off Will, I only came here to tell John what happen.. that's all.
@heythereweee -- arm &lt;
@heythereweee No, fuck you. you said "you'll never find anyone" and if it isn't true why would you fucking say it? &gt; she scratches her left-
@heythereweee No, after she left you.. I had to save her ass and I think she is catching a cold, poor girl~!
@heythereweee Shut your fucking yap John, I have.... &gt; she pauses as she sighs sadly &lt; ...... no one.
@heythereweee She can do it while she is ALONE, to be honest I think she fell in the ice last night as she went to skate on the ice.
@heythereweee No, fuck him. &gt; she crosses her arms with a soft growl &lt;
that man is... well, just no.
@heythereweee You should know she is a sensitive cupcake...~! her crying could go on for hours... what have you done?
@heythereweee 
&gt; the pink hair demon pokes John with a grin &lt;
soooooooo... John, I heard you made poor pinkie cry... that's terrible~!
@JrCipher tsk, yeah sure.. I do.
@JrCipher .... you're ok I guess...
@JrCipher the powers are stupid and he looks sexier, sorry willy ~!
@JrCipher Insano 2.0, that's stupid.
@JrCipher I doubt pinkie will mature so I'll be here for along time...  so.. you're just "new INSANO"?
@JrCipher the fuck do you mean...? "slipping away"..?
@JrCipher ..... THE HELL? &gt; she flinched at the word "love" &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she crosses her arms as she sighs &lt; just... shut the fuck up already..
@JrCipher &gt; she punches his face, causing it to be bruised &lt;
I SAID SHUT UP!
@JrCipher ... &gt; her voice became squeaky, her blush became dark &lt;
s-shut the fuck up you cock sucker!
@JrCipher &gt; her face lights up as she lets out a low growl &lt; 
f-fuck
@JrCipher YOURE BLUFFING.
@JrCipher he is the re------ WAIT, HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW?
@JrCipher To be honest with you, I hate everyone with a burning rage so... guess.
@JrCipher HAH... Ok, you're lucky on that one..
@JrCipher -- know how that would feel like.
@JrCipher well I can't help that I have boys waiting in line for me to blow them, it's a gift. &gt; she crosses her arms &lt; but you wouldn't --
@JrCipher I wasn't trying to insult you, Dumbass.
@JrCipher what if I was wearing green? blue? red? would you call me that you fucker?? and.. yeah, that's my name.
@JrCipher Why the fuck should I tell you?
@JrCipher Makes sense... &gt; she crosses her arms and sighs &lt;
@JrCipher what are you..? elastic girl?
@JrCipher what the hell...? &gt; she lets go of him, quickly shaking her head and lets out a loud growl &lt;
@JrCipher &gt; she snaps, quickly grabbing his throat with her right hand &lt; shut the fuck up already.
