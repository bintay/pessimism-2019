Distinctive laughs run in my family.
@aching_beauty don't feel bad! D:
@aching_beauty eh. I don't mind it. My mindset is more like "At least someone cares enough to call even when I might be sleeping." XD
@aching_beauty should've called! You never know unless you try. :) I would've stayed awake. Well, tried to anyway.
Finally made my way to downtown McKinney. I missed this place.

Me: The right flower for what?

4: To sh…
Surprise birthday brunch for Alec! :D

"He is dead because he didn't floss"
@musicintherain praying for you.
@aching_beauty the last tweet was bland. Character limits suck. better?! Introversion isn't a sickness! ;p I'm curious what you'd get tho!
@aching_beauty Meh. You seemed kinda extroverted at Prom. It's not hard to believe you're introverted, just that there's no extrovert at all
@aching_beauty I find that kinda hard to believe. o.o

But it guess introvert doesn't necessarily mean anti social. ;p
@aching_beauty tis true, tis true. That's why I said almost. :) I also have a little introvert in me. XD
@aching_beauty that's awesome! :D we're almost complete opposites. o.o ISTJ is an interesting personality type :)
@aching_beauty @UberFacts how do you outlaw hamsters though. Like, how does that work? How is it enforced? O.o
Music while working on core, arm strength and running. @AgentsofSHIELD while working on chest, leg strength. I've gotta a good system guys.
@BerthaWesslerRB technically you can... It's just kinda illegal.
What. No. That's crazy.  
I'm an ANFJ, leaning more towards E than I, so this is pretty much spot on other than the alone time thing. 
@sammiekehoe I worked two jobs from January - April 2014 and September 2014 - January 2015. While still in high school. It was awful.
Never seen so much lightning in my life. O.o
@feBREeezze definitely will do :)
@feBREeezze no idea :(
@feBREeezze awe! We'll miss you! :)
@aching_beauty that's gonna get you in trouble ;P eh. Schools almost over anyway. It doesn't matter anymore. XD
@_stephherrera Yeah we will! :D
@feBREeezze thank you :D are you going to Mind Games?
@aching_beauty so close... Yet so far... It'll be alright though :) staying up doing homework just isn't agreeing with me. D:
I have great friends guys. :)
Guys, I'm kinda done with this whole school thing... And this whole life thing... I need a break from life for a while. Hate this feeling D:
@Lifewithigor 
Singing really loudly and then remembering everyone is home.

4-year-old: I can't. I'm thinking.

Me: About what?

4-year-old: How much I hate cleaning up …
@aching_beauty 
@aching_beauty Jaden Smith absolutely cray.

Yep. Still awesome.
Resentment 

Love this guy.
Guys, my little brother says "Yah" like a highschool girl. I mean, I do too, but it's really funny hearing him say it. XD
Some months I use twitter once every two or three weeks, other months I use twitter every freaking day.
@feBREeezze I have a week and a half! D:

Me: It tells me what to do when I'm driving.

4-year-old: So it's Mom?

Me: What's that?

4-year-old: I'm in a gang now.

Me: Are you sure?

4-year-old: Yeah. I fed it to her.
Welp, that didn't last long. It's was a good run though. I don't regret it.
Death Cab for Cutie can go sit in the corner. I don't need feelings right now.
@sammiekehoe thanks!
@sammiekehoe yup! I'm at the local community college right now, but I'm transferring to UTD Fall 2016 :)
@sammiekehoe almost done with Highschool. I'll make it out there over the summer :)
You ever have so much stuff to do that you do none of it? Yeah, that's me right now.

So this was fun 
Guys, I literally can't stop laughing at this. Thanks to @Arty_G98 for the picture and @7jacobeck for the caption. 
Chicago bound.
Saw this on my drive home tonight. 
Offensive things are only offensive if you let them offend you.

@iamlunatic98 I doubt it. XD
Sitting in my frozen car eating frozen granola bars with my frozen hands. 

I feel like this is how the apocalypse begins.
I can't feel my hands. I'm also hungry. I guess I'll eat my hands.
Poured hot water on lock. Didn't work. Poured more hot water on lock while inserting key which was soaked in hot water. Am in car now.
stuck at home because ice

So my car lock is frozen shut. 

I can't leave work.
Saw someone who looked just like @AngryJoeShow at Best Buy in Plano today.
Happy Valentines Day guys!
@DyingLightGame Hey, I preordered at Best Buy, but I never recieved the code for the skins that were supposed to come with it. Help please?
@sammiekehoe agreed.
Hey everyone, @sammiekehoe's is a beautiful person and her face is not disappointing. Just thought I should let everyone know.
Why does my face have to be so disappointing?
My face is all sand papery already. Dang.
Why you gotta live way out in Flower Mound though?
LEGO Jurassic World Game - Teaser Trailer: 
This is me when I buy things. 
@garrettMOTSger Walgreens? Really?
@lawrenonit just heard Craxyr. Why aren't you already famous?


4-year-old: Is that the one with Leprechauns?

Me: No.

4: Not interested.

2-year-old: *grabs nine pieces* I can’t count.

I think I just got hustled.
Just realized I've been liking pictures from 3+ days ago on Instagram.

Oops. XD
Hate missing class :/
@JamesAllen03 don't have your number anymore man :( phone deleted contacts.
@JamesAllen03 dude that sucks. I'll be up there on the occasional Wednesday, but not very often.  :/
@JamesAllen03 yup. Tuesdays and Thursdays. You up there too?
The Five Stages of Hating Your Job: 
First day at Richland was pretty cool! :D
@TheStaceeJaxx I gotta meet my doppelganger.
@ELMO1598 this is you. 
So who wants to go to this with me?? :D XD 
Phone acquired. Text me! All contacts are gone. :(
@richlandcollege should sign up for Google Apps for Education. It's free and would be super helpful for a lot of students. :D
@Sam_Elijah97 @ELMO1598 this too. 

@LaylaRenee18 @Mads4God Making parallels to the Bible is fun, and it's possible with almost anything. It really shows how connected God is.
Supposedly I'm getting my phone back tomorrow around 5pm. Here's to hoping! It'll be nice to not have to rely on friends phones to text. XD
I'm gonna get someone else to change my twitter password for me when classes start. That way I can't log in.
And here I am again on twitter instead of doing my homework that's due tomorrow...

College is gonna be great.
I'm gonna ask my sister to hennify me.
Too bad I can't legally get one.
Seeing my sister with Henna everywhere makes me want to get a tattoo.
I honestly only agreed to do it so that I can use Zoolander quotes in real life.
Skinny jeans, converse, untucked button up shirt and leather jacket. 

I have two of those things.
This means I have to wear attractive clothing. 

I can't fashion.
So I kinda got a modeling job? Hair cut place wants me to model for them.
So this happened. Dad ordered. His name is Les. #sowrong #wrongname #oops 
My phone should be returning to me tomorrow. :)
@Michael_T98 that's what I should be doing.

Instead I played video games and stayed on twitter.
"@Alexxx_irish: Listen to Coldplay with me" so I know it's real
My dog just punched me in the face.

She literally gave me a black eye. What even.
Guys, it finally happened. A customer came in today specifically  to buy @TripLee's Rise album and I knew exactly where it was. :D

"I really want to talk to you" 

                 and

"I don't want to annoy you."
@Michael_T98 that's a loaded question. It's so good that it's worth the wait, but it's good enough to where I'd personally see it asap
@Michael_T98 yeah man. Limited relesse. AMC at Northpark mall has had it since christmas. That's how I saw it.
@Michael_T98 It's already playing at Northpark. Since Christmas.
Not normally one for football, but that call was stupid.
The Netflix buffering circle is the bane of my existence.
Note: did not have a bad day. Just felt like hopefully encouraging  someone before I pass out :)
We all have bad days. Don't let them control you. Just work on being the best that you can be. :)
Running on fourish hourse of sleep. Why am I still up?
@sammiekehoe you shaved a girls head off? That sounds kinda illegal.
Did not get fired. Scheduling person just forgot to publish mine xD
Hey guys, my youth group is having a Bible Study event tonight from 6-10! We're going through the entire Bible. If you wanna go, let me know
@sammiekehoe Oh, yeah, that sucks :/
@sammiekehoe You should've ate with us after!
@sammiekehoe Yeah, we didn't want to lose our place in line :( One of my good friends was at that concert too! She was mad I didn't say hi.
@sammiekehoe Sorry :( I'll come visit soon though :) And maybe eventually!
@ELMO1598: "I have the unbreakable potluck"

This was said in reference to the skeleton key from Skyrim.
@sammiekehoe would if I could but I can't :(
@ChrisCassi13 Nope, part time.
@ChrisCassi13 I wasn't put on the schedule next week. I don't really know and can't really think of why I'd get fired, but yeah.
Might get fired tomorrow.

Here's to hoping I don't. 

*BIG BLOCK RAINBOW THING OF HOPE*

Doesnt look nearly as cool as it looked in my mind
Apparently being a skinny dude, having a beard and wearing dress shirts makes me looks Mormon. 

I guess that means mormons look awesome.
Everyone at work says I look like a Mormon. 

I'm not quite sure what consitutes a Mormon look, but whatever.
So many Mormon selfies...

You guys are awesome.
Crying makes my face hurt. Crying while having allerigies makes my head feel like it's about to explode.

In summery: Crying = Bad for Noah
@Mads4God Praying for you!
@SteeleAlex every day is a music day
@AndyMineo describes my life in so many songs.
Youth was so great tonight :)

@fitforaking @ForTodayMattie That breakdown though... 
Love my managers and supervisors at AMC. Gonna miss them for the four months I'll be gone :/
If I wanna go to college and keep my job this semester, I have to work Sunday's. :/
Hey @ELMO1598, I have your chistmas present now. It was in my car. I guess I'll give it to you tomorrow.
Got my car back :)
God is with you in the good times and the bad. Don't forget that.
To my fellow seniors in High School, this is your last semester. Have fun. Make the most of it. Don't slack off. You're on the home stretch.
Praying for everyone that starts school today! Hope you do well and glorify God in all you do! Have a fantastic first day back! :)
My dog just sat on my face. Not cool man.
Work on myself and my relationship with God. Goals for life.
Man, I realize now that I kinda lost myself in the past few months. I'm not really sure why/how, but working on myself is my goal for 2015.
I challenge each and every one of you that reads this to simply resolve to be the best you that you can be.
#ResolutionsFor2015
Class starts in three days... Classes at Richland start in two weeks... Blah.
*Levitates bread*
Me flirting: 
May or may not have been live tweeting this sermon. I'll stop now though.
Jesus loves all of you. Remember that.
Be yourself. Be real. Be you. There's only one you. Don't hide yourself from anyone. If they judge you, you don't need them in your life.
Love the worship playlist this morning. You guys are in for a real treat today. :)
2015: single

Consistency is key guys

Me: Jesus paid it all

University: it don't work like that

Me: U sayin Jesus aint good enough…
Since @Olivvviacraft has been retweeting my tweets, I was gonna retweet hers, but I then I read them and no. Not good for right now. XD
I constantly beat myself up over stuff that I shouldn't. This is just another season of life. I'm still growing. I need to remember that.
"I could spend my life just trying to sift through what I could've done better but what good do what ifs do"
Well, not the greatest start to 2015, but I still have high hopes for the year as a whole and can't wait to see what God has in store for me
I can't believe I didn't say this sooner, I'll just believe that I was all displaced
No cell phone for 2+ weeks! If you need/want to contact me, DM me on here, FB, or call my home phone (Message for number).

Confession 7: In 2015, I want my life to be completely led by God, 100%.
Confession 6: I'm not really sure what to expect next year. I hope it's a fantastic year though
Confession 5: I really liked the first 3/4ths of this year. the last few months have been one thing after another, but I'm pushing through.
Confession 4: Confession #2 was formerly only known by about 4 people before now.
@sammiekehoe And I love you random citizen!
Confession 2: I was in therapy for depression and suicidal thoughts for a couple months. One reason I try to be suicide prevention minded.
New Years Confession: Never kissed anyone ever. Unless you count that time when I was 5 in Kindergarten which I don't remember happening.
Or call my home phone...
Phone committed suicide. No phone for at least two weeks. :( If you want to talk to me after today, just use Twitter and/or Facebook.
@KnightforGod should just be "Noah Jasper Bemont"
@KnightforGod I'll join man!
My dog gets super excited every time I say "Good boy"

I don't know why, but this brings me great joy.

@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 wow my phone is so speciesist. Not a single emoji of a dog.
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 that doesn't make me feel any better about... Anything, really... XD
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 wow I feel so very loved right now. Thanks guys. So much. So very much. :p
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 I'm pretty sure if I let them touch my face long enough I would just fall over dead.
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 this argumentative Noah is deathly allergic to cats. D:
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 *spelt
@noah_zachary97 @katieefoshee yeah she spent cats perfectly but she was obviously trying to spell dogs and that's not how you spell dogs.
@katieefoshee @noah_zachary97 you misspelled dogs. :p

"@BlimeyCow: Here are some things girls should stop doing to guys. What do you think? 
@116Texan it is crazy! But it means they are committed
@116Texan yeah Bradley Cooper is great. He must've gained around 100lbs for this role though. Doesn't look like himself at all.
@116Texan it really was great. Bradley Cooper didn't look like Bradley Cooper at all.
@116Texan Kinda! It released on Christmas day in select theaters. AMC Northpark in Dallas was one of the theaters.
American Sniper was a very powerful and emotional movie.

Philosophical quotes from Raegan.
"Sneezes are like buffets"

Philosophical quotes from @ELMO1598
@Tricialee43 yeah its really really bad. -.-
@Tricialee43 the amazing smell of fried foods. 

It's basically like we've been dipped into oil and then sent home.
And by super attractive I mean the opposite of that. 

It's gross.
I always smell like fried food when I get off work at AMC.

It's super attractive.
@bonjuritsmaddie happy Birthday! :D
@Michael_T98 dude, the movie is great.
Today was a great day :)
@Michael_T98 like I know my siblings are gonna wake me up in like 4 hours and my body just doesn't seem to care.
@Michael_T98 dude. Me either. It's awful.
Hi, my name is Noah and I overuse the word "awesome"

It makes me sound super boring.

Meh.
Merry Christmas :)
Downtown Dallas was absolutely beautiful last night. 
@Sam_Elijah97 you could fly. XD
Had a dream that all of my friends had super powers. It was great.

Nothing. Let's just say nothing. Saying nothing is enough 
Should I try and sleep for one more hour before work after a pretty late night, or just deal with 5 hours of sleep? Hmm... Sleep. XD

Definitely made me feel better after the last couple weeks I've had.
Great night. Had lots of fun. :)
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 Psh, you have to go. Who else will bring the holy water? :P
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 I thought you maybe wouldn't kinda.

Apparently I retweeted @ELMO1598 and @RayAnn_Smith too many times... My account is no longer allowed to retweet for the rest of the day. XD
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 :D DDDDDOOOOOOOOO IIIIIIIIITTTTTTT
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 Tell me the results. :D
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 Actually that may be a bad thing. XD
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 HOW ABOUT WE JUST EAT WHOLE BIBLES INSTEAD?! :D
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 Do it. Get it here by Sunday. It is you mission.
@RayAnn_Smith @ELMO1598 Gospel Christmas music. The clenser of souls.

I love my dog.

The other dog that lives in my house is pretty good too. Most of the time.
"Why do you say that?"

"Probably because we're sleeping in a refrigerator."
"I have a friend who's been shooting since she was 9. She goes to competitions and stuff."

"She sounds way more successful than us"
Wanna quit one of my jobs.

But I don't at the same time.

Why.
This homework is insane. -.- 
@JeffDenton  I can go anytime!
Just heard @lecrae being played at @AMCTheatres. Feels good man.
@MOTSmetal lyrics that always make me feel better: 
Done with that. Time to listen to music until I fall asleep again. Goodnight guys.
I know that like no one reads my tweets, but it makes me feel better to vent on here. Just ignore me more than you usually do. XD

You must be plotting something.
@JeffDenton will do! When?
@ChrisCassi13 wow. Yeah, that's terrible.
@KnightforGod that's true.
@ChrisCassi13 worst thing ever. Or they just decide they don't want anything. Always a downer. What happened bro?
@JeffDenton want me to make a surprise appearance? Already got the costume. ;D 
@KnightforGod I think it's better to not even have the opportunity. Easier to resist then. But that's my opinion.
That moment when you're supposed to get off work at 1:30 but leave by 12:15. Feels good man.
Was super awkward. Nope. Just nope.
Don't swing that way bro.
@thefeebster97 did a great job at her choir performance tonight! :D
@AmbieMSmith awesome! :D
@AmbieMSmith I'll take 4. XD
@AmbieMSmith wait, let me see how much cash I have.
@AmbieMSmith doooooo ittttt. I'll take like 5.
@AmbieMSmith buys asap
One thing would've made it better, but it will come with time. Hopefully anyway. :)
So happy right now. Great night overall :D
I finished my homework before midnight so I can actually sleep before class.
Had the best dream last night. Like the best. One of those dreams I wish were real :P
Strive for more than that.
Beauty ≠ sex appeal.
@WestEndHoffbrau nope, no idea.
Guys this is so cool. The fog this morning over Downtown Dallas. :D 
I had a dream in which my facial hair finally connected.

I was very disappointed when I woke up.
My sister just said that no male is worthy of her attention.

So I guess I shouldn't worry about her too much.
Why though? XD
So apparently the girls in my sisters dance class all talk about how attractive I am.
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 I do that as often as I can which is usually once a week XD
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 what is slowing down? Haha XD I have Sundays and the occasional Friday off typically. It's all good for now.
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 this whole semesters been crazy for me. Two jobs and school is no Bueno.
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 totally understand. Being tired is like my life.
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 oh my gosh. XD
@Mads4God @LaylaRenee18 you're both awesome

@Will_Manson @xbadchristianx WAIT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?! Two of my favorite things! :D
But, finally home. Now time to sleep. And hopefully forget about it. Meh.
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
@RayAnn_Smith @AmbieMSmith @ELMO1598 hey, not our fault you left your ipod alone. :P
... TWD Twitter and Facebook pages both just spoiled the episode. Thanks guys. So much.
Break is over tomorrow. I have mixed feelings. One of which is joy. The other is complete terror.
Gonna binge watch Sherlock. Again. 2017 can't get here soon enough.

He neverlands.

I like this joke because it never grows old.
Always pray guys. Makes life better.
You know what makes it better? Prayer time. Going down hardcore tonight.
Welp, all that did was trigger depressing memories. Don't you hate when that happens?
And that's a dream I wish were real. Sigh.
Had a dream that I woke up and was late for work.

It wasn't real. 

The fact I was in a video game should've probably tipped me off.
There are dreams that I wish were real, and dreams that I am thankful aren't real.
Happy thanksgiving guys. :) have a wonderful day.

And my heart along with that

But yet for God, somebody said:
Do you know what you are getting yourself into?
I'm getting into You because you got to me, in a way words can't describe
Just be yourself.

Mocking Jay was pretty good! Had fun today with @_stephherrera, @h_lizetteee and people who refuse to join Twitter.
@_stephherrera I still get one, right? Or like half of one at least? XP
Seriously though. Perfect reply. So disappointed and kinda depressed I can't use it any more.
I just thought of the perfect reply... To something that was said a couple hours ago. -.-
@AmbieMSmith @RayAnn_Smith twas a good play too.
@KC_katiecook will do.
So I finally got home after working all day. Looked at my gas gauge and it said "0 Miles to Empty."

Guess I'm not going to work tomorrow.
Youth friends and anyone else interested! No Hot Spots tonight! We'll have breakaway at the church instead!
Weirdest message ever. She said "I wouldn't date you because your last name doesn't sound good with my first name"

I'm just like "...what?"
Also... A girl I haven't heard from in a couple years randomly messaged me today.
Training new people. Ask them all how old they think I am. Lowest guess was 20. Highest was 35. Thanks new people. So much.
Wish I had time to do things with people. Don't worry though, the day is coming. :D
If anyone wants to come keep me company at AMC, that would be great. I'm so bored. XD

-take a nap
-spend 4 hours on twitter
-cry
I'll just say that I am so happy to be in a house where there's no wind and a bed where there's no rocks.

Can't wait until I actually have time so I can ask a certain person a certain question.
I love when I gain an hour of sleep by literally doing nothing. :D
@_stephherrera *like ever
@_stephherrera haha. There were like 15 employees. I don't know what they expected. People don't go to stores on Halloween. Luke ever. XD
@_stephherrera I was okay with that request.
@_stephherrera it did! I wasn't supposed to get off until like 10 but they were like "just go home. You've been here long enough"
@_stephherrera well we can clean and make sure everything straightened up. But it already was. So. We just stood around and talked. XD
@_stephherrera totally meant food is good. XD
@_stephherrera aww! Lame :p jk. Good is good. All I did was stand around until they told me to just go home. It was so slow after 6pm.
On a completely unrelated note, my final project for Eagle is tomorrow! Please pray for me. If youd like to help out, let me know! :D
@thefeebster97 I think Monolo by @TripLee should be your theme song.
On a similar note, bought @TripLee's album Rise. It's awesome and Monolo is my new theme song for life.
@_stephherrera I would've if I hadn't been working :/
Ready for the day when someone wants to buy one of their albums. That customer and I will have a moment.
I have the locations of @AndyMineo, @lecrae, and @TripLee's albums at Best Buy memorized.
@oct2006 @ELMO1598
"gyfdoaysdfoyisagd" - My brain right now.
Oh yeah, new phone. Text me so I can have your numbers! Or don't. Either way. XD
Today felt awkward to me... Probably because I was late... And tired... Yeah...
@_stephherrera @h_lizetteee yeah, I would be too! Same thing almost happened to our house awhile ago. Retaining wall stopped the car though.
@_stephherrera @h_lizetteee yeah, it is :/ sorry about your house! Glad you guys are all okay though! :)
@h_lizetteee whoa...
When I'm tired I read into things too much. Then I'll look at the same situation when not tired and mentally kick myself for overthinking.
<GROWING HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<BLUE HEART><YELLOW HEART>
@CNassardeen didn't show up XD but I made a pretty big sale, so there's that.
Oh yeah... The president of Best Buy is meeting with me tomorrow. So that's a thing. I wonder what's gonna happen.
Excited for what the future holds, whatever it may be.
@sammiekehoe snapchat en route!
@sammiekehoe what's your snapchat?
When I get tired, my right eye closes more than my left eye when my eyes are open. I didn't realize this until I started snapchatting a lot.
@part_scott totally didn't know that back then, but now I do.
So @part_scott, you know how @ELMO1598 and I tweeted #therewillbeviolence at the rangers game a while back? It's an Impending Doom song.
Just now got a chance to post this. Had a great time at Sachse's homecoming last night with @_stephherrera! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
“@Emmicakes711: I smell like fried food<WEARY FACE>” me every time I work at AMC
@RayAnn_Smith @_stephherrera @part_scott @AmbieMSmith tell that to my manager -.-

When does it start? They might cut me. No one is here.
Wearing a pink dress shirt. Was just told I look like a sweet and low packet. Don't know whether to feel insulted or complimented.
@sammiekehoe all the cool kids are over here.
@Elencase47 also I'm totally jealous you went to comic con.
@Elencase47 no problem. I'll be praying for you :) if you ever need to talk I'm all ears!
@Elencase47 hang in there. It'll all be okay.
@sammiekehoe is across the street seeing Echosmith or something. Loser. :p just kidding. Gary says hey btw. :D
At Stubs BBQ in Austin to see Brand New live! :D
Was just introduced to Pecan Root Beer. I may be in love.
@GraeWinter I know the church has a couple interfaces that aren't being used as well. Could see if they'll let you borrow/buy one.
@GraeWinter gotta be careful with the audio interface. It's not too great. you might have a better one. If you do, use that.
@GraeWinter fun fact: it's what Oh, Sleeper and Mouth of the South use live.
@GraeWinter hah, it could take it. It's pretty durable. It's made for live vocal performance, so it can take a beating.
@GraeWinter the SM58? Sure man. Just be careful with it. Its a $250 mic :P
@Dirk334 just gotta be careful in general. I've been pretty careless in the past year or so and if like to change that.
@Dirk334 haha sure. In all honesty it basically encompasses everything in my life right now ranging from school to work to cheese grading XD
@GraeWinter got it. Cool.
@Dirk334 it could be work related too... Why you gotta go straight for the cheese man? :p
@GraeWinter why the second account? XD
@Dirk334 both actually. They're similar, right? Maybe I'm shredding paper. Idk anymore :P
Trying to be careful this time. It's hard, but I want this to end well. That means I can't be careless. I will be careful this time.
I am raising money for my mission trip! If you would like more information, text me at 9723229644, or DM me here! :)
For the record, yes, I know I misspelled Necessarily wrong in that last tweet. That was purposeful.
I can spell unparalleled perfectly for some reason, but still can't spell nessecarily without a dictionary. -.-
As much as I wanted to move to Seattle last year, I'm glad I didn't. So much has happened in the past year and I'm so glad I didn't miss it.
So apparently there was a really bad storm last night at 2am. You know what I was doing at 2am? Sleeping. And not waking up.
I forgot lyrics to a song, the name of the song, and the artist. But I know it exists, so at least I got that going for me.
*insert song lyrics here*
@Ajgoudy basically.
@Kristenkelly07 they're so fun. Especially if you dress up and everyone wants a picture of you. :D
So I can't leave work because of this storm...
@Sam_Elijah97 ... -.-
Should I shave for my class pictures, or shouldn't I? Hmm... Thoughts? Opinions?
Great... Now I have to deal with this. Thought I had finally figured everything out. Sigh. :/ hope it turns out well.
Everywhere I go, someone is talking about Ebola.
I guess I'll just pray that whatever ends up happening is within God's will.
Haven't felt like this in a while. It's a wonderful, yet scary feeling.
Tonight was great! :D
Watch the Harvest America live steam at 
@LaylaRenee18 if he had meant it like you said it, I'd have had no problem. I didn't mind the original tweet, but that reply... :/
@LaylaRenee18 :/ 
@LaylaRenee18 no, he literally says that to the pastor that replied to him.
@LaylaRenee18 he says the Lecraes music pleases the flesh and is not of God.
@LaylaRenee18 @Firebrand01 I thought so too, but look at his reply to the pastor who said he listens to Lecrae.
@Firebrand01 @LaylaRenee18 but Lecrae isn't bad at all... You can be spirit led and a man of prayer and still listen to Lecrae.
@mrmedina nah man. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
@Firebrand01 @THEJosephC777 what? If you mean people enjoy his music, sure. It's not sinful. God wants us to enjoy things.
At the Lecrae and Andy Mineo concert :D @Sam_Elijah97
@AmandaGresso I'm going naked, so.
@Michael_MOTS @MOTSmetal @ColtonBartholet @fitforaking so this kinda blew up. You guys are awesome. :D
I want my first tattoo to be either @fitforaking or @MOTSmetal lyrics.
@ELMO1598 good, good. You didn't deny the polish guy a ride
@ELMO1598 is your car okay?
@ELMO1598 no, why? Did someone ask you for a ride?
Technically yesterday... It's late...
Caught up with an old friend today. :D
@abbyraepanak me too. I tried last night but I have no time -.-
@KC_katiecook do it. It's crazy but in a good way.
@purityprobs Psh, my ceiling is still covered in glow in the dark stars.
Quote of the day: "Ice cream melts faster than chicken, so I'm eating the ice cream first." @ELMO1598
So while hanging out at the mall today we decided to go to Toys R Us. While there, I decided to look… 
@sethocoolio88 we should go next time they're here.
@IronNomad @AngryJoeShow @Ductos only Console copy's are going out. Something about the PC code being messed up. They're trying to fix it.
@geeklockian yeah I guess!
Says they'll text me and they expect a reply.

Doesn't text me.

Hmm...
@geeklockian haha. It's probably because it was the first thing I called her. Just kinda stuck. Hard to say anything else now. :|
@geeklockian it really is. I should probably learn to call her by it. XD
@geeklockian Phoenix. It's an awesome name. I just can't say it unless I think about it first for some reason.
I literally can't call her by her actual name unless I think about her name before I talk. "Little Dog" just comes out involuntarily.
Also, she's laying on my foot right now. All feeling has left my foot.
I call my two dogs Milton and Little Dog. I never call my second dog by her actual name.
@itsblakec yeah, only inventory people do truck. Most of the workers do down stocking though. Maybe not at your location though.
I get so distracted when writing papers. -.-
@itsblakec hmm. Maybe so then!
@itsblakec You can get Magnolia certified later, but if your job title isn't Sales Consultant - MHT, you won't be starting with Magnolia.
@itsblakec You're probably just regular Home Theater. When you go to do your paper work you should get the blue Best Buy shirt. Wear that.
When did KJ-52 get really good? I mean, I always liked him, his new stuff is crazy good though. O.o,
@itsblakec cool, will do! If you have to get Magnolia certified, get ready for a lot of elearning. It's kinda crazy.
@itsblakec nice! I was nervous too, but It is fun. I started on Wednesday! :D are you gonna be at Plano as well, or a different store?
@itsblakec awesome! What department will you be in?
I got a tattoo. 

It's fake. But it's still a tattoo.
The dogs. 
@sethocoolio88 I want to see them live again.
Had a fun time today. :)

2-year-old: Don’t eat it!

That’s a solid start.
@Mads4God that's what I say any time I write anything ever.
Happy Birthday to both my dad and my little sister!
Wait. That wasn't a frog. Nevermind.
I don't like anything on Instagram that was posted more than a day ago. It feels stalkerish if I do.
Anyone want to see Maze Runner at 10? I'm thinking about going...
Meatballs are the doughnut holes of meatloaf.
@BeeMerryToday oh, I love the library too. My city's is kinda small though.
@BeeMerryToday except when you're so sick you can't get out of bed. XD I have Netflix for TV shows anyway.
Being sick isn't fun even when you have a library card.
I rarely use Instagram anymore. Dunno why.
One of the guys I was doing paperwork with was awesome. But his license was expired so he had to go get his paper one from home. Not awesome
Just got the phone call. I am officially a Magnolia Home Theater Sales Consultant at Best Buy in Plano!
@dbuswans you're amazing.
“@jandals4life: When in doubt wear jandals they go with everything” @AmbieMSmith @RayAnn_Smith
@ObviouslyACapt but today is Sunday...
Couples that pray togeth…
Got @lecrae's new album #anomaly! :D 
Color Up 5K was fun! Had a great time with @_stephherrera and &amp;@h_lizetteee :D
This weather is amazing. If it's like this tomorrow I will be so happy.
So why is it called the #GloUpChallenge? And why is it even a challenge? Getting older kinda just happens... It's not really hard.
Really hope I don't screw this up like I did last time. Gotta be a little more careful this time.
Today is gonna be a great day. :)
Three interviews today. Prayers would be greatly appreciated :)
I retweet way too many things. And one of those retweets was awkward, so I thing I'm gonna unretweet it. XD
@France_Missions yep. It's good!

#ANOMALY
@ObviouslyACapt off by three days :P
@SocialxClub might have to travel to CA just for this.
I guess technically it's my third interview... Meh. The first interview was like a minute long. It doesn't count.
Second interview with Best Buy on Wednesday! :D

Do life together.
Love one another.
Be on mi…
@lecrae @iTunesMusic Welcome to America, Say I Won't, and Dirty Water!
Hate is not becoming of Christians, and it saddens me further that I see more Christians filled with hate than I see with love.
I know loving your enemy is a hard concept. As a human, I'm outraged at what ISIS is doing. As a Christian, I am deeply saddened.
@Mads4God hm... Maybe I'm the regeneration of you, then. XD
@LaylaRenee18 @Mads4God Thank you! Means a lot :D
@Mads4God I'm wondering if you're me. Haha. I swing dance and then go to heavy metal concerts right after practice sometimes. XD
@Mads4God Good! Glad my occasional dumbness brings joy to people! :D otherwise it would just be regular dumbness, which isn't any fun.
@Mads4God haha you don't have to be sorry. My mistake. I thought it was funny too. XD
@Mads4God you're welcome :) John Barrowman is confirmed to be there!
@Mads4God I totally tried to look up Wholess, Washington to see if you were near any cons. I now realize what you meant. XD
@Mads4God 
@Mads4God and there are conventions everywhere, you just need to know where to look :)
@Mads4God I almost moved to Seattle last year! Didn't work out though.
@Mads4God yup! Conventions are a very fun experience. Next one I'm going to is WhoFest. Can't wait for that. :D
@Mads4God the kid looks fantastic as well. Props to his parents.
@Mads4God here it is! I know the shoes are the wrong color, but Converse are expensive, so I worked with what I had. 
@Mads4God haha I can tell. Thanks again. :) Tweet you a picture I took with a mini cyber man if I can find it!
@Mads4God I wore this to Comic Con Dallas, the 50th and Deep Breath. So many people asked me for pictures. It was awesome.
@Mads4God thanks, means a lot! Looks a lot better when it's a full picture, but it didn't work as a profile picture.
@Mads4God you're never alone :)
@SocialxClub I always want a hug. Not cause I'm always sad or anything. I just really like hugs. :D
@RayAnn_Smith all the snapchats.
Sachse lost, but it was a great game!
@Mads4God all the time
You should be here. :D 
@AwolAmbience @part_scott @RayAnn_Smith this is also true.
@part_scott @RayAnn_Smith yup, I know. Amber is @AwolAmbience btw.
@part_scott yep!
Who's going to the game at William's Stadium tonight? If you are, let's hang out!
I love Social Club.
@TobyTurner So like, once right? :P
@KC_katiecook :(
@ELMO1598 check my last tweet.
@oct2006: If anyone wants to tag along with Samuel and I to see Forrest Gump at AMC Firewheel tonight at 7, let me know!
@Hipzip14 a friend of mine saw that and said "He has touched sacred grounds. This can not be forgiven."
@ItsAlexIrishBro 
@116cliquefan @getthecanon Still doesn't work :/
#Anomaly
When we build a wall between us and God, we create a wasteland for ourselves.
@KC_katiecook You are the car.
@Lecrae's new album is currently streaming on iTunes! It's really good! I highly encourage a listen! :D #Anomaly
I never really associated it with anything bad, I guess. When I got in trouble, my parents never used my middle name.
I love when people call me by my middle name. I don't know why.
@NamesAlex_Hi awesome! We'll miss you but I'm glad you're moving forward :)
@GodlyDating101 I think you mean "Not all men are dogs." :)
“@umIove: What did I just read 
@NamesAlex_Hi awesome! When are you leaving AMC?
@NamesAlex_Hi where at? :D
Second interview at Best Buy! :)
@thefeebster97, Raegan, and Olivia called Drake and I tonight. It was fun. XD
Third wheeling hardcore right now. XD
My face is all sand papery. -.-
I can't stop replaying the teaser of @YATband's new single. Can't wait.
When The Game Stands Tall. Fantastic movie. I recommend it. :D 
@thefeebster97 was it me you or Arthur that came up with this? I know I came up with the second part.
Driving in that downpour was not fun. 

Getting to my car and back inside wasn't fun either.

Getting cooled down, however, was fantastic
@_stephherrera awesome! I'll watch it now. Just got off.
@_stephherrera haha I saw that you sent me a video right after I posted that. XD worked picked up though, so I can't watch it anyway :(
I was mistaken, you do not need headphones for video snaps. I am just dumb. Carry on with life. XD
I'm so boring on Thursdays. Maybe in general too, but on Thursdays I can feel the boring coursing through me. Hopefully that changes soon.
@_stephherrera @gladysdiaz77 it's still confusing sometimes. XD
Laying down your life for mine, Jesus you are truly amazing.
Starting over with friends you've grown apart from, or never really knew in the first place is great. :D

I just wish it happened more often
It's slow at work. Can you tell? 
"If I put myself on the pedestal this will have all been in vain... I am nothing without grace." - @MOTSmetal
First guests in two hours and I sold them both stubs cards. Twist: one had my name, the other had my moms.
@116Texan and they usually stop coming right after lunch.
@116Texan yup! It's been mostly older people. Today is senior day, so everything's cheaper for 60+ year olds.
@116Texan The AMC in Garland
I've been literally sitting at work doing nothing for two hours. Nobody has even come in. XD
@Hipzip14 haha I know. I was joking about the case being expensive. I'll probably get one tomorrow.
@h_lizetteee they're all pretty good. Blue is my favorite though :D
@Hipzip14 cases are so expensive though. XD
Just remembered I have an essay due on Thursday, I still have Syllabus work, and I work all day tomorrow. Looks like another all nighter. :/
@Hipzip14 he is me.
@h_lizetteee Blue Machine is better :D
@_stephherrera run and hide. XD
Working until 6 tonight. Five and a half hours left!
Maybe that's why I had a dream that I was late to work. XD
Forgot to set my alarm and nobody else woke me up for work. Yay. Time to rush.
@KC_katiecook my ticket was 42 in a 20 school zone. I didn't even know the school zone had started because it didn't have lights.
@h_lizetteee that's exciting. Ci-cis hasn't changed anything for like 10 years. XD
Beard fan thing that somebody was handing out at the concert last week. XD 
In other news, church was pretty great! 

disclaimer: I did not sleep at church.
I would make a second account just to post lyrics all day if I could switch between accounts without logging out. But I can't. So yeah.
@Miss_Missionary WOO GO MUSIC LOVERS.
@Miss_Missionary haha yeah, people are different, it's all good :)
Planned on doing homework today. Nope. I slept. Lock-ins are fun. But oh so tiring.
@Miss_Missionary Skillet!
@h_lizetteee that's a thing now? :D
Praying for everyone who starts school tomorrow! I hope you have a wonderful time, and remember to live for Christ, even in school!
@Miss_Missionary I'm the same. It's all good!
@Miss_Missionary I'm contradictory, but I'm not contradictory.
I hate when Christians say "Only God can judge me" for multiple reasons. One reason being that it's completely wrong. 1 Corinthians 5:12.
It's easy to love those who love you. It is incredibly hard to love those who hate you. I encourage you to do exactly this. 

Matthew 5:46.
Don't believe everything you're told. Not everything will be true.
To my family and friends and those I left in the cold, I'd take it all back if I would have known not to believe everything that I was told.
Video I took was too long, so I'm just posting the water part on here. I did the ALS ice bucket… 
First day of School. My sister won't get up. Great start. XD
It's getting to the point where I have to brush my facial hair when I wake up.
You have called me deeper;
And I will go where You will lead me Lord.
What if we all just stopped, listened to, and cared for each other for once? 

What if we treated people like they matter? Because they do.
My mom just gave me a cinnamon sugar pretzel and caramel sauce from Auntie Anne's 

Basically my mom just handed me diabetes.

I ate it all.
I wish you could share pictures on Instagram. Or download them to repost them. Taking a screenshot and posting that is a little ghetto.
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, 
@AwolAmbience I love your Twitter name. I'm dying. It's great.
Little hard to see, but I sweat so much at the concert that my fingers got all pruned or whatever. It… 
The #runandescapetour was amazing! @VERIDIA was amazing live, @demonhunterband was fantastic, and @redmusiconline killed it, as always.
#runandescapetour 
Red! #thedoor #runandescapetour  @redmusiconline 
I have an extra ticket to see RED and Demon Hunter tonight at the Door! If you're interested, let me know!

⁰I am convinced we're so consumed with life, we've forgotten how to live. #uprooted #liveforGod #dietoself
So we stopped at Sonic after the Fall Out Boy concert and they were playing Fall Out Boy. XD
@ItsAlexIrishBro one that even the bands will probably remember.
@ItsAlexIrishBro I know! A lot of people did. Then the power went out.

It'll be memorable at the very least. XD
@ItsAlexIrishBro @chaselordi I was there! Under the Pavilion though.
@ongoingconcept Will do! :D
Stage power went out. XD #rain #sucks 
All the power just went out. XD
Raining! Good thing we're inside! 
Just saw the guys from @ongoingconcept walking around Gexa Pavilion! :D disappeared before I could say hi though.
In line for Fall Out Boy, Paramore, and New Politics! :D
@jverkules I enjoy it. Not obsessed with it though.
You will not be disappointed.
God's not dead nor does he sleep!
@ongoingconcept come back to Dallas soon! :D
@jrrydberg23 That's good, because real Christianity isn't to 100% stay away from anything worldly anyway.
@GraceVGrace @ELMO1598 All the favorite.
@TobyTurner I'm good at computers and phones and all kinds of technology including Mac and iPhone and stuff :D #helptoby

@MOTSmetal is just awesome live. Can't wait until the next show.

Keep being awesome guys! And keep the faith :)
@ongoingconcept was amazing as expected.
Finally going to see @ongoingconcept live :D

30 more minutes.
Show time #dirtysouthfestival 
There's a picture of @ELMO1598 that I really want to post... He knows what I'm talking about. :P
Great night :) I missed my church people!
@ItsAlexIrishBro awesome! I already have tickets for that. :D
@ItsAlexIrishBro Wait, you're going to Fall Out Boy?
@Olivvviacraft haha don't wanna see Kevin, eh? :P I'm working tomorrow morning! I don think Kevin will be there... Idk
@Olivvviacraft WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?! I MISS YOUR FACE TOO.
@Olivvviacraft @KC_katiecook haha you're welcome! :D
@Olivvviacraft @KC_katiecook it's true.

7 Truths About Marriage You Will Not Hear In Church 
I'd read it. #sherlock #watson #manga #bbc #comiccon 
@Olivvviacraft good, now I have 3rd party confirmation. I feel better now.
So. I'm torn between two events. RED at the Door or back to school dance. Both same night. I'm leaning more toward RED. Thoughts?
@purityprobs thanks so much. That's exactly what I needed to read right now. You're awesome! :D have a great night!
@ItsAlexIrishBro I'd make that dri... Yeah, probably not.
Looking back at camp and Germany quotes, I'm convinced I have the funniest friends in the world.
Remember, in all things #makehimfamous #yearoftherhino 
Bahahaha. Thought I had to be at work at 10 today. Nope. 4:30. 

When does the Jet Lag end? XD
Tickets acquired for Lecrae and Andy Mineo. :D 

If anyone else is going, I'll be in the GA Pit. No reserved seating for me. :D
Lecrae - Jesus Muzik ft. Trip Lee Video

@thefeebster97 @ELMO1598 old school @lecrae! :D 
@_stephherrera @thefeebster97 @ELMO1598 let's go! :D
@_stephherrera @thefeebster97 @ELMO1598 I already put this on FB, but redundancy is key. Andy Mineo and Lecrae will be in Dallas in October!
I am alive. Four plane and zero crashes later, my team and I have made it to Germany and back. It was amazing and I can't wait to go back :)
At Base Camp! I'll see all of you awesome people in about 10 days :)
At Base Camp!  #germany #igo #missiontrip #basecamp @ Camp Copass 
Leaving for Germany today! :D
I can't believe we're leaving in less than 24 hours.

Please pray for me, @ELMO1598, @thefeebster97, Olivia, @part_scott, and @part_rach. :)
Hehehehe. AOT! :D 
Free Slurpee day at 7/11! Confession: I've lived next to a 7/11 for years, but this is the first free… 
Every time I think I’m getting closer
To break through I make the same mistakes.…
Great movies with great people! :D 


Listen to this woman. You are so much more than the pictures you post online, and the attention you get from guys.
Beginning my trek to Germany in two days... Seems kinda unreal. Pray for me and the team to do God's Will while we are there!
Just bought tickets for @redmusiconline and @demonhunterband at The Door! :D
Then I'm free all day Friday. If you wanna do something Friday, feel free to ask! :)
Then at 7, some friends and I will go to the Double Feature of Planet of the Apes. If you wanna go, let me know!
A few friends and I will also be screening Sharknado at my house right after Hawaiian Falls! Feel free to come to that as well! 1/?
If you wanna hang out before I leave for Germany, I'll be at Hawaiian Falls tomorrow morning from 10-3! 1/?
@ChrisCassi13 why indeed
Rangers Game! @ Globe Life Park in Arlington 
Also, getting up at 4:45am makes 1pm feel like 5pm. -.-

@MOTSmetal @DirtySouth_fest well now I have to go.
@KC_katiecook but you got to see me! :D

Sorry about what happened :( hope everything gets better soon!
I'll be hanging out at the Chick-Fil-A off North Garland Avenue around 7 tonight! Go on over and help support us for our trip to Germany! :)
@_stephherrera @thefeebster97 @ELMO1598 oh yeah! :D don't forget to put your receipt in the box! :)

I want to be more worried about what people think of Jesus because of me, rather than worried about what people think of me.
An awesome ending to an amazing week. :) 
@skitguys That's where my mom told my dad she was pregnant with my little brother. XD
Don't aspire to be just like someone else, because you can be so much more.
On a side note, Happy 4th of July and Happy Birthday to my mom :)
Amazing things were done at camp. I pray that people take with them what they heard and apply it in their own life. :)
So many things I want to say to so many people and I probably won't get a chance. It's depressing.

@SherlockSH and @bbcdoctorwho need to get here sooner as well.
@SPN_updates needs to come back sooner.
People at work trying to set me up with other people from work. -.-

#Whateven #Why #Thatsnothowitworks #life
I've said so many things I regret, be it out of anger, selfishness, jealousy, unclear mind, you name it.  All I ask for is forgiveness.
I never hate myself more than when something I said or did to lose a friend pops into my mind. Woo. -.-
I just read "23" as "Secondy third"

I need sleep.
@nicole10pt9 I know :(
@AwolAmbience I'd watch that show
@AwolAmbience exactly. I memorized how long the theme song is and just skip that far forward every time.

(It's 1 minute and 40 seconds btw)
@AwolAmbience I know. I still click it to save those precious seconds though.

Like I said. Ruined my life.
@AwolAmbience then she just looks at me like I'm going crazy.
@AwolAmbience I DO THAT ALL THE TIME! My moms like "what are you listening to?" And I'm like "Nothing. They're unplugged"
@AwolAmbience the "Play Next Episode" button on Netflix has ruined my life.
@AwolAmbience There was literally one episode where I was like "okay. I could probably wait a little while before I start the next one"
@AwolAmbience oddly, I do too, but not when it comes to SNK.
@AwolAmbience I carried my phone to the kitchen, watched while making a sandwich, watched while eating said sandwich and repeated.
@AwolAmbience I can count the amount of times I thought SNK was boring on one finger. 

I did get food though.
@AwolAmbience 20 minutes per episode, 25 episodes, only took around 10 hours. :)
So I landed that Voice Acting job. It's a small part, but it's still cool :D
@nicole10pt9 your favoriting of tweets reminded me that I forgot to tell you something.

I... I am switching classes. :(
At work, I can hear everything that everyone in the court yard is saying through the headset, even when they're whispering.
I can't social media anymore.
Is that depression welling up inside? *burp* Nope. Just gas.
Side note ^4 I've been sitting at work for four hours doing literally noting.

Gettin' paid though. So there's that.
Side side side note, my face in this picture. I can't even. 
Side side note, I rewatched Attack on Titan today. All of it. I rewatched all of it.

Gearing up for that VA gig. Can't wait!
Side note, best album cover ever. 
Still haven't seen Fault in our Stars. Should I?
Okay. Enough pictures. Sigh. I miss my old phone and all the pictures on it :(
@SPN_updates 1967 Impala display at Comic Con. 
@fitforakingband at the Door :D 
@YATband at the Door :D 
Met a cyber man-child at Comic Con. 
@thefeebster97 thrift store selfie ;p 
"Doctor Who Cosplay? What is Cosplay?" 
Anime Sherlock. I'd watch it. 

My dog missed me. 
Sometimes traveling can get lonely. Wait, that's not the word... What is it... Oh, right, life. Sometimes life can get lonely. #SadButTrue
Excuse me while I go cry for being back in the real…
Mind Games was probably one of the best experiences of my life. I highly recommend it to... Well... Everyone ever.
"Maybe that fish wasn't very well homeschooled"

"...Very well homeschooled?"

"... I meant very well cooked. I was reading her shirt."
"They only keep me around for comic relief, and I'm not even good at that"

Just kidding. I'd miss my family too much.
I can't wait to get out of here. Two days. Never coming back.
I had the best dream last night... But the person who made it great isn't really a part of my life anymore. Sigh.
@livvvcraft I hate people like that.
@livvvcraft don't you hate it when something awesome happens to someone but they can't talk about it and they still post it on social media?
Side note, something awesome happened but I can't talk about it until next Tuesday.
I hate when something awesome happens and you can't talk about it.
"What are you doing? There are no pizza breaks in Mario Kart!"
“@livvvcraft: Hey @OzzzTin @oct2006 we had the best idea <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
“@micahlikeslions: Uh oh... this is going to get a lil' rowdy. #ohsleeper 
Side note, Season 9 of Supernatural was great overall, but the finale was kind of lackluster. It was just... Boring. But the ending. Cray.
Can I make new friends with headphones? Is that a thing? No? Okay. Well then.
Ncosiaoqjskaosjwkxbajfiwhabdjakskajsndnskdndosbaodjdi.

I need headphones and friends. 

Oddly enough, those are almost polar opposites.
I don't even drive anywhere but work because I'm boring and don't have anything to do or anywhere to go. Blah.

I need to record a new cover
Day 7 of no headphones

It's been a week. I am now experiencing withdrawals. The only place I can listen to music in is my car.
I just entered in the #rainofinvites raffle to win an invitation to buy the @oneplus One 
I'll be in a wheelchair/on crutches for two weeks!
#stillworthit
@fitforakingband I got severe muscle trauma from a stage dive during "Ancient Waters" last night.

Totally worth it.
@Rajio The power of /r/xboxone compels you.
@Rajio Psh, duh. Haha yeah man. Sorry XD I'll fix it.
@Rajio The power of Xbox One Compels you.
@fitforakingband do I win something if I get all 10 in? ;p
Free ticket to Fit for a King. Anybody want it? I have an extra. Let me know!
@fitforakingband sweeeeeeeet. I have a goal. :D
@fitforakingband So guys... How many stage dives should I do tomorrow? Record is 4 or 5. Think I should try to beat it? ;P
That last thing I tweeted is the best thing
@GraceVGrace @AwolAmbience @tardisblue97 @ELMO1598 and any other Supernatural fans! 
I have an extra ticket to Fit for a King on Thursday! Let me know if you want it!
May the Fourth be with you :)
This place gives me unpleasant memories. Sigh.
"So... That's a thing?" 

"Ah. Yeah. Too many things are things."

@SPN_updates is just awesome. #things #toomanythingsarethings
@AwolAmbience Yep yep yep! :D
Missed @AwolAmbience and her sister at youth because my sisters photographer took too long. :(
@AwolAmbience I looked. I can't afford seated tickets, and GA is sold out. :(
@AwolAmbience ticket master is offline. XD
@AwolAmbience yeah. Bleh.
@AwolAmbience I have no input. XD do you like Fit for a King?
@AwolAmbience I want to. I just checked. Tickets aren't being sold currently. :/
@AwolAmbience is this your first concert? If so... Great first concert. Second, band shirts. Or just whatever. I usually wear whatever.
@AwolAmbience I was but my uncle changed his mind :( I'm still gonna see if I can go, but I won't know until tomorrow morning...
@AwolAmbience I'm going to Fallout Boy is August :)
June bugs keep slamming into our front door and I keep thinking someone is breaking in.
Basically music gets me through life.
Also... Rebuilt by @S_TheAssembly 
I curse myself often for all the mistakes I've made. Love Brittle Spirit by @aFeastforKings for that reason. 
@ChrisCassi13 yeah. It was great at first. Good pay, easy job. But things have changed. Plus I don't want two jobs right now.
Only have to endure one more week of this. Counting down the days. #cantwait #sodone #nomoreofthiscrap #quittingtime
@livvvcraft Nah. Which Wich again. One of the managers there is on a power trip.
Called my manager out on something that she shouldn't have done. She said she was sick and tired of me talking back to her. #Whateven
@RavenSoftware I need another good X-Men game. Loved Origins. Get on it!
Hell On Earth is the best EP I've ever heard, tied with @YATband's Testimony EP

Thanks @aFeastforKings :D
Just subscribed to @LootCrate to get awesome geek/gamer gear monthly! Check it out: 
Please give me peace, Give me joy, Give me sanity. Give me hope, Give me love, Give me truth.

#Unconditional
Inhale, exhale... Why is is so hard to breath?! Inhale, exhale... Why isn't this working?!

#Unconditional
This shadow always keeps me on the edge. I know that I would never jump so why can't I step back from the ledge? Am I losing control?
@ELMO1598 haha, just wanted to be different from everyone else, huh? ;P
@livvvcraft... ;p
Guys, give me cosplay ideas! I need new ones other than Doctor Who.
Note: people touching my hair does not scare me. I actually like it. Sometimes. :j
Is it bad that people have told me they'd marry me just for my hair? Specifically so they could touch it all day?

I do. They scare me.
@AwolAmbience We have to find the polar bears. :P
@OzzzTin taught me how to scream better, and without losing my voice. No lie. He's great. Hopefully I'll release my vocal covers soon :)
@AwolAmbience Okay we both have to run north though, got it?
@AwolAmbience Dooooooo ittttttt. Or 7. 7 works too.
I have a serious case of not-being-at-campitus. Also have a serious case of I'm-not-as-social-as-I-want-to-beitus.
@AwolAmbience You should get up at 5:30 and run with me in spirit! :D
People are like "How do you make friends?" and I'm just like "Well, I start by wearing shirts... and then people talk to me..."
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso Sounds like me in the car.
@bbnbband is one of my favorite bands now. If only they could come to Dallas and open for @fitforakingband's headliner. ;P
@fitforakingband was fantastic and letlive. Was insane as always. #sbsw
Why is this happening again. I hate these situations -.-

Being friends with girls is hard.
So afraid of collapse, I never built at all. I'm just held back by my own walls.
If only I could hate my pride half as much as I used to hate myself.
@GraceVGrace I'm not clicking it because whatever it is will most definitely not make it better.
@GraceVGrace it just occurred to me that I really have no idea how to describe sleep in a way that actually makes it sound pleasant.
@GraceVGrace NO WHY NOW ITS STUCK IN MY HEAD GAHHHHHHHH. 

... Where we can learn to work and play... 

Gah. Brain. Stop.
@GraceVGrace Grace is referring to herself in third person. That typically means she has to use the sleep.
@GraceVGrace Also, Pshhhhhh, you're total quality Internet material. You just have to belieeeeeeeeeve!
@GraceVGrace I thought for half a second you mentioned yourself and I was about to say something but I realized it was a quote.
@Elencase47 I know! That's why I wanna go to Dallas this year, cause it's 100% all ages. 

Austin is only 30% all ages :(
@GraceVGrace the Internet has much more quantity than quality. But it still has some quality! :D
@Hipzip14 @GraceVGrace still better than nothing. Been wanting to rewatch them anyway. :D
@Elencase47 most of the bands I want to see in Austin are playing in 21+ venues this year :(
@Elencase47 I want to go to Austin SXSW, but I haven't yet. I was actually referring to Dallas' SBSW, but my phone corrected it.
@Elencase47 Austin or Dallas?
@GraceVGrace Grace Grace Grace @GraceVGrace  Grace Grace Graaaaaaaaaaaace @GraceVGrace Grace Grace Grace Victoria Grace Grace. 

#Quantity
Who wants to go to #SXSW with me? :3

So. Many. Bands. 

So. Much. Awesome.
@GraceVGrace you mentioned me three times in two ways @GraceVGrace

Also, Grace, I concur that pokemon is worth emphasizing @GraceVGrace
@GraceVGrace I agree that I should be too... But... did you just mention me twice?

Two can play at this game @GraceVGrace
@livvvcraft I had to make the tweets that lead up to my 1,000th amazing. Mission accomplished.
@GraceVGrace So my entire childhood is being thrown on Netflix for all to see.

This is perfect. 

I am excite.
I'm jumping the gun! I'm taking the wheel! Fighting wounds that just won't heal! And I'm trusting you, faith will make a way!
All I know is I should, I should have thought things over  And all I know is I, I could have done this better.
I wish that I could just restart with more momentum. With better luck and better cards, and my best intentions
I think I'm sick of second best, and silver medals. Another trophy of regret, that says I could have done better.
This sickness needs to die. Quickly.
Concert was awesome, but I don't think I've ever smelled this bad before in my life...
@OzzzTin yeah man! Stage dives galore. Lead singer gave me his mic! You know what you gotta do for The Word Alive! Get on it!
Excited about @BEARTOOTHband tonight!

"I don't know about you, but I'm admitting now that I have a problem"

#SickEP #Unconditional
@issues new album is awesome! :D 
@AwolAmbience @CHVRCHES callin in all day erry day
@AwolAmbience @CHVRCHES DO ONE OF THOSE THREE THINGS. 

Winning tickets would actually be fantastic.
@AwolAmbience @CHVRCHES it's still two months away! AMBER YOU MUST CONVINCE THEM OR GET MONEY WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. MUST.
@AwolAmbience @CHVRCHES YEAH LETS GO! :D
@AwolAmbience completely and totally serious. :D
Totally meant watching on that last tweet. Again, #priorities
Aaaaaaand of course I just start watch The Walking Dead. #priorities
@jwoodham Too soon
I'm done with all my homework before 9... What is this sorcery? I don't know what to do with myself. o_o
@AwolAmbience 
@AwolAmbience @CHVRCHES AMBER THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN FRISCO IN APRIL I'M GOING YOU SHOULD COME TOO
@AwolAmbience Devin of Emery, Haste The Day, and akissforjersey all said that and they were all back together within 3 years :)
@AwolAmbience haha I don't know why I put that "Own" into it. 

Or two years...
@AwolAmbience I liked the name of their last song "Faking Your Own Death". Hopefully that means something.
@livvvcraft yeah man! XP
That awkward moment when you ask someone what they're doing right after they just told you what they're doing...
@livvvcraft D:
@livvvcraft Is it really that bad? o.o
If you ever apply anywhere, put "TIME Magazine's Person of the Year 2006". It's not a lie, and it would make your interviewer laugh at least
@jordanhollie3 @livvvcraft bro, I'd buy you a sandwich, if my AMC paycheck hadn't been as low as it was XD
@jordanhollie3 @livvvcraft 

Ah. I hadn't read the other responses. Caught up now XD no free sandwiches! :P
@jordanhollie3 @livvvcraft I'm slightly confused. XD

@AmandaGresso I bought a new one when I lost mine. Then I found the first one. Then I lost both. Then I bought another one.
@AmandaGresso I don't know... It really isn't though.
Valentine's day? Pshhhhhh ain't nobody got money for that.
@AmandaGresso truth of life
@AmandaGresso haha you know I work at Which Which cause you went to that free thing on Saturday! :p
@AmandaGresso hey ma'am, I don't work Sundays. It's against my religion. ;p
This is my reconstruction 

@S_TheAssembly 

#Imbeingreconstructedfromthegroundup

#Iamrebuilt
I tried to save myself but I failed

@MemphisMayFire 

#thisis #noordinarylove
It's snowing.
Aaaaaaand now that Fit For A King has good merch, I want all of it. Perfect.
If I could chill and listen to/play music all day every day with no worries I'd be happy

But nooooo society had to invent money and payment
@Lizi_Quinn There should be a Metal Bowl.
Hey\. I miss your face. So. Yeah. You should come back. :P
@KevinLankford dude, why aren't you in a band? Or start one? Or do something solo? You're amazing!
Because dreams are never achieved without making mistakes.
You've always told me I'm worthless but now he's shown me my purpose. You can say anything you want to me but I won't let you win this time.
Let me out, I plead insanity! I tied my freedom to a black hole within me! @aFeastforKings 

#lyrics #amazingness #afeastforkings
Jesus will literally rip people apart with his voice during the second coming. That's how metal He will be.

Revelation 19:11-21
@tardisblue97 @AwolAmbience @whichwich what did you guys put for Superhero name and Why is the sky blue?
@YATband I want to be! Sadly, it's a training shift that I can't really get out of :/

What time do you guys go on?
@sammiekehoe I think it's March 19th-21st in Greenville for $50ish
@sammiekehoe dude, let's go! :D
If I actually practiced my speeches and debates instead of waiting until the last minute I could probably do a heck of a lot better.
Oh well. Still got South By So What and Unconditional Tour. Speaking of which, who wants to go with me to either of those? :D
Really wanted to go to that @YATband concert with InDirections and a bunch of smaller bands, but I accidentally took a shift at work. :(
Lots of inspiration going on outside AMC.
Anyway, the kid was good. He was like twelve and he probably made around $30 in donations. He was following his dreams. He was inspiring.
There was also a kid outside AMC last time I worked that was dancing like @Dancingmisfit. But like a super white version of him.
"@micahlikeslions: Never hesitate to spice things up a bit, ladies and germs. 

WHOA WAIT WHAT. OH, SLEEPER JRISHROFJ
Okay, he wasn't there for 6 hours. More like 3. Anyway, he was there to help. Not for himself. 

I want to be like free hugs guy.
The cool thing about free hugs guy? He wasn't there to hug hot girls. He hugged everyone. He talked to people about their problems.
There was a kid outside AMC holding a free hugs sign for 6 hours. GM said "As long as he's not charging people, it's alright"
@AmandaGresso I can't afford it with my mission trip, so I'm not going either. 

I gots my priorities set straight man.
In other news, I haven't showed, eaten, or slept since last year. 

I must smell awful.
Happy New Year! #2013 wasn't perfect, but I had a great year with you guys! I love all of you and hope you have a wonderful #2014!
A gecko crawling up my leg while taking a shower is probably the strangest thing I've experienced.
@Dancingmisfit @AmandaGresso am I invited? :3
Gah, I hate myself sometimes.
I use the encyclopediadramatica. Everyone should use it. It's wonderful. The best encyclopedia. 

Just kidding, drama sucks.
Tonight's Walking Dead... I was not prepared. Holy crap. I don't even. I just. I wasn't prepared. 

It's finally getting good again.
Doctor Who 50th! @tardisblue97 @AwolAmbience #DoctorWho50th #SaveTheDay #Dallas #Auditorium11 #DayoftheDoctor #50thauditorium11
@AmandaGresso Heh. I don't invite people to movies. I wait until they ask me to invite them to movies. 

It's very ineffective.
@AmandaGresso I COULD'VE GOTTEN YOU FREE TICKETS

I'm just rubbing in the whole you not telling me thing. :P
@AmandaGresso BLAH

WELL HAVE FUN WOTHOUT ME THEN

And be prepared to not leave the theater until around 1:30. It's kinda long.
@AmandaGresso WHY YOU NO TELL ME I WOULD'VE TAKEN A SHIFT OR GONE WITH YOU.
There is nothing holding you down but your own doubt, break free and believe.
How do I have friends?
Goats for the win.  They would just eat everything #igocon
My phone was jacked. Moose would totally win. #igocon
No wait I'm wrong an octopus would win. I mean come on.. Eight legs. #igocon
Moose would win because they are giant beasts of death. Seriously. Ever seen a moose? They're gigantic. You do not mess with them. #igocon
"Let me out! I plead insanity! I tied my freedom to a black hole within me!" @aFeastforKings
"Losing it all made me realize I am the victim, the culprit, the casualty, and the cause."
So I should go to Theo.
@AwolAmbience Do they sell motivation? I would buy it. All of it.
@AwolAmbience Right there with you. Just a bad week and did not want to do anything today and freaking everything is due tomorrow. -_-
@Lizi_Quinn Those are all wonderful especially Tokyo Drift.
"My fear has paralyzed me to the point of resisting every good thing in me."
But I'm back up to 2,000 words, so it's... Not really all good, but not awful.
So apparently I have a major jaw infection. On top of that, my computer crashed while working on NaNoWriMo, and deleted everything. #badday
I'm not evil, no matter what you think of me. I'm just human and there's a part of you that's just like me
People suck.
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience All I've done is homework :/
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience 3005
@AmandaGresso Thank you :)
On another note: Dad's interview starts tomorrow. Pray that God's will be done. Even if it's the opposite of mine. :)
I know things will never be how they were with a few of you, I know I hurt a lot of you, and I just wanted to say sorry. 

kthxbi :)
I want all of you to know that I'm through that phase in my life and I feel better than I have in months. I just hope you can forgive me.
I know some of you hate me for stuff I did/said the past few months. I don't blame you at all. I hated myself for it. Kinda still do.
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience Yeahhhhhh probably...
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience Exactly. Not happy.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso I wouldn't say it's fast... XD
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience Because we're awesome. Let it sink in slowly. We. Are. Awesome.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso Well thanks. Now I may or may not be slightly depressed. :|
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience UMM UMM MY WORD COUNT IS 1663! 

Wait no. That's not happy.

I'M ALMOST DONE WITH MY HOMEWORK! HA! HAPPY!
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience NO DON'T CRY EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY, RIGHT?
I told myself I wouldn't get any closer to anyone until I knew, but here I am, getting closer to old friends and making new ones. No regrets
I did everything I told myself I wouldn't do, and it turned out exactly how I thought it would.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso It's nights like this where I really wish moving wasn't even a possibility... :/
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso There was supposed to be a D there.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso AN I LOVE YOU RANDOM AMBER
@AmandaGresso There's a missing  in there somewhere.
@AmandaGresso But... But... I' not done with my homework either... :(
@AmandaGresso ... That doesn't make me feel good at all.
@AmandaGresso ..........

I thought I said that this topic was off limits...

1504...
@OfficialEmery You guys better come to Dallas soon or someones gonna die.

And it probably won't be me. Maybe. No Promises.
@AmandaGresso Yes... But we're doing the amazing kind of procrastination.

Totally worth it.

(Not really)

(But no really)
@GraceVGrace IT'S NOT WORKING

I can't feel my feet,
@AwolAmbience TO NAME OR NOT TO NAME, THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION BECAUSE I CANT NAME.

Stop teasing me. :c

So not name.
Guys I'm so cold right now I can't stop shaking but I don't wanna move. Help.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso Not... Name... Cannot... Name... No compute...
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso CAUSE YOU PEOPLE BROKE MY BRAIN
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso I guess I just don't have the ability God gave Adam to name. It just left me suddenly.
@AmandaGresso Heck yeah we are. We're awesome.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso I don't think she's Noah. I think I'm Noah. But at this point I'm so confused I don't even name.
@AwolAmbience @AmandaGresso  I'm dying slowly on the inside... I an't even follow the tweets anymore. I don't know who's saying what or help
Last tweet was not about any of you wonderful followers, by the way. It's about a situation 2 years ago that just came to mind. Ignore. XD
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience BUT YOU JUST DID WHAT ARE YOU DOING STAHP
You say things that you don't mean, and that's what kills it for me.
@AwolAmbience I think you quite possibly killed my phone. I have 100+ Twitter notifications. I'm scared to check them.

Hold me.
@KC_katiecook Don't say that!
@AmandaGresso Heh. Trying to get back at @AwolAmbience. Sadly, you were caught in the cross fire. Don't worry though. Twas a worth death :P
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience Homework is my biggest enemy.
@AwolAmbience Is it... Is it over? Or did Twitter break? o.o
OH MY GOSH MY PHONE WONT STOP VIBRATING @AWOLAMBIENCE STHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP HOLY CRAP ITS STILL GOING AS I TYPE THIS
OH MY GOSH @AWOLAMBIENCE, SO MANY FAVORITES ALL AT ONCE WHAT EVEN
I bet my costume was kinda recognizable to them as well...
Of all the people talking about the Oh, Sleeper concert that happened on Friday, they retweeted my tweet about it.

My week is made.
@KC_katiecook None of us do. We're just desensitized now. XD
@KC_katiecook AMC is Hiring... :P
Anytime someone says something like "You deserve to burn in hell" to anyone, I say "So do you" 

Don't say that when you deserve the same.
@AmandaGresso @AwolAmbience Just imagine what it would be like... 
"Hi, I'm Noah, and I'm a procrastinator. In fact, I'm doing it right now"
@AmandaGresso There needs to be a motivation store. My entire paycheck would go towards motivation.  

But then I'd be poor. 

Worth it.
@AmandaGresso Yeah! Like... Those people who aren't participating... Maybe... XD

We can do it. Just need motivation and no distractions.
@AmandaGresso oh... Well... I have... 1101... So... I do feel bad. XD
@AwolAmbience yes. Yes. Just yes.
@AwolAmbience I don't blame her. That's my reaction everytime.
@AmandaGresso procrastination is definitely not the key to success. I'll say that much. XD
@AmandaGresso 

........................................................................................ 

I don't wanna talk about it. XD
Sitting here on Twitter when I have so much to do. Homework... NaNoWriMo... Walking Dead... Sleep, since I haven't slept in three days...
So.. That @weareohsleeper concert was probably the best thing ever.
You can only be built so high before you fall. But the fall isn't what kills you. Not getting back up, that's what kills you. #dontgiveup
@NaterTater196 Sometimes it does... Sigh... But it'll get better bro, don't worry. :)
That's it, I'm quitting life and starting a Post Hardcore or Metalcore band. Who's with me?
@NaterTater196 I know the feeling man :/ It's always a stupid idea to look through the posts.
So many people asked me to take pictures with them. I'm gonna be on a bunch of random people's Facebook's. Kinda weird to think about.
I just realized this is the month that all my usernames for everything ever reference. 

Kinda late... Oops...
I never realized how skinny I was until I put on this morphsuit. My gosh.
That awkward moment when a guest tells you that "you're too old to flirt with that girl" First, just talking. Second, she was older than me.
@livvvcraft Rock it! You'll do great! :D
@SteeleAlex Dude me too.

I was sad when I woke up.
@NaterTater196 @AmandaGresso #Thatvideowasawesome #noregrets
Or maybe I'm me now. I just never knew I wasn't myself before.
@Homeschoolah "I CAN'T EVEN MEET ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE PEOPLE I ALREADY KNOW"
@homeschool_prbs The put the Homeschoolers in with the kids who were on probation where I took it. o.o
@JACattack52 Yup.

Work it out and be mature
@maddie_taylor96 Same...
@Homeschoolah Except I might be moving to Washington soon. :(
@MOTSmetal Oh, Sleeper for Micah's birthday show three years ago in Downtown Dallas.
@Homeschoolah We're all in Texas. :P
And then they start tweeting each other. #Supernatural #evenmoreawesome
I love Tuesday nights when @jarpad and @mishacollins live tweet @SPN_updates #Supernatural #Misha #Jared #amazingness
@AwolAmbience This is probably the best thing I've seen in weeks.
The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget
@livvvcraft Kevin came downstairs today just to tell me I wasn't allowed to leave. XD
I seek answers to why I'm so lost, but what will those answers cost?
I feel like Repunzel from Tangled when she leaves the tower.

I also feel like saying that is kinda gay

#whatever #lovethatmovie #noregrets
But if I do move, I'll be super sad too.

WHY CAN'T THIS DECISION BE EASY.
I'm kinda excited about the possibility of moving. Starting over. Just because I've made so many mistakes. A complete reset sounds wonderful
I love my coworkers. So much. My best friend and them are probably the people I'll miss the most if I move.
@SteeleAlex That's me right now x(
What if we're wrong, what if we're not all alone? What if we're lost, and we missed the whole point of it all?
No matter how much this hurts, it's probably for the best. I wish it could be different.
Homecoming was awesome! :)
Reconnected with old friends... Why did we ever grow so far apart?
Please pray for my family. We are about to make a life altering decision.
AMC's work culture is kinda amazing.
@SexAndOreos it was actually stupid busy for a Monday. They had two concessionist and lines went to Greeter at one point.

- Martin Luther King, Jr.
We can completely change someone's attitude from bad to good by just saying a few kind words. Why don't we?
In other news... The Saints lost. I may or may not be crying right now.
I know we'll never be how we were, but I still care about you as a friend. But you apparently don't feel the same.
Going through Twitter to retweet things because it seems like that's pretty much all I do, but there's nothing good to retweet right now...
I just pray that I never lose sight of the things that mean the most.
@livvvcraft Just too long...
@livvvcraft This is crazy. I haven't even been in Box for like a month and a half. What is this.
@livvvcraft Holy crap I don't even work this weekend. I have two opening Box shifts on Monday and Tuesday and that's literally it. Pissed.
Protip: Don't ask which way the cameras are facing, how many security guards there are and what they carry. Especially at a movie theater.
@sammiekehoe Understandable. Lets meet half way. :P
The song 36 Days by Hawk Nelson puts me in tears every time I hear it and I don't know why. It's not even a sad song. O.o
I think I liked my old hair better because it made me look younger... Now I look even older than I did. -_-
Oh, look, more posts about the fair that I wasn't invited to. :P
"I'm so sick of living in fear of every trial that I face, of every word that they say to me." @YATband
@sammiekehoe Sooooo? Three hour drives aren't that bad! :P
Stop inviting me to play Candy Crush. I will not take part in the madness.
WAIT I BROUGHT MY NAMETAG HOME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. 

Now I have to remember to take it with me tomorrow... Dang.
@livvvcraft You're awesome. Thanks so much.
"Some people are really mature"
"Yeah. Some people say that about me."
"...Noah... You're hugging a pole..."
"IT'S BECAUSE I'M LONELY OKAY"
Today was actually a wonderful Monday. Like, the best Monday I've had in... Probably ever.
@sammiekehoe YESSSSSS LETS GO.
Cause I could spend my life just trying to sift through what I could've done better, but what good do what ifs do?
A lot can change it two weeks... O.o
Gravity was kinda amazing. Definitely recommend and would see again.
Ouch. Pain.
I can see out of both my eyes.
@YATband thanks guys :)
"I've been avoiding the desire of existence. There's nothing else I can do. There's nothing else I can say." @YATband
Wow, I'm a sucky friend...
Last night was amazing at first and then it sucked, but it was my fault... All I seem to do recently is screw up. I am not a smart man. :|
Grandma in the hospital again. Prayers would be appreciated.
I have not been very kind or loving towards some people recently. I apologize and I need some prayer for me to change.
"@Crystal7Madison: Ooooooo I could tweet something but I will restrain myself for the sake of my friend <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>" This happens so much.
@SteeleAlex and her youth pastor looks like Justin Timberlake. It's crazy.
@SteeleAlex Dude... I met a friend of yours from your school tonight. Hope. 

Side note, the Bible study her church does is kinda amazing.
@megankay03 will do.
I got a couple things to work on. :/ 
I live for nights like this.
This rain is insane. I love it.
@sammiekehoe aww :( maybe next time! How was the concert?
@sammiekehoe I know. I'm sorry :( you should stay in town until Sunday! Or come see me at work tomorrow! I could get you a free ticket! :D
@sammiekehoe CURRENTLY AT WORK. ABOUT TO HEAD HOME THOUGH.
Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was very punny.
Anyone want to come to see Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 at AMC Firewheel 18 at 2:15? Have one free ticket!
I'm broken, scattered across the floor in anguish, when He said to me, "You're abandoned? Never again. No" @YATband
There is a fine line between confident and cocky.
Ever had a dream about someone, and when you wake up you're suddenly super attracted, or more attracted than you were to that person?
Wow, this is painful. Why did I let this happen? Guess I just gotta push through. I wish life were easy. :P

*falls in love*

"A DUR DARR DERR."
@sammiekehoe @aliiMarieeee WOOOOOOOOOO YAY
@Homeschoolprob4 I know the feeling. 
@sammiekehoe A 9 year old once proposed to me.

I thought it was cute, and I didn't want to say no, so I might be engaged. Maybe.
@sammiekehoe YAY! :D
@sammiekehoe I wish they were making movies out of all John Greens books, actually. That would be amazing.
@sammiekehoe Hahahaha I didn't even notice. I think it's funny you spelt the non curse part of the curse word wrong. XD
@sammiekehoe Great book.

@AwolAmbience Heh. Twitter tells me you no longer exist. :P
The days I learned to be a better person are not days I reflect on and think "That was a great day!" Those days were the hardest of my life
@Dancingmisfit Let me know if you wanna talk about anything! I'm here, man. :)
If I ever start a band, my first order of business will be to convince them to cover at least half, if not all, of the 2007 Wavorly songs.
@QueenOfFangirls @AmandaGresso Aww... I don't think I'll be there. :/ I think I'm going to See You At The Pole in Sachse though :)
@Dancingmisfit Dude... I'm actually totally wearing white right now... XD
@QueenOfFangirls @AmandaGresso Ohhhh, really? Nice! Is that this Wednesday or next?
@QueenOfFangirls @AmandaGresso Wait, there's a special service at ARBC next Wednesday? Do you have any other info? I missed church Sunday...
@QueenOfFangirls It looks wonderful! :)
@Dancingmisfit... Do you have one? :P

I will receive my punch at homecoming.
The service here is so bad that a text I thought I sent nearly 3 hours ago hasn't sent yet. #oops #sorryguys
"He's got a great deal more to offer than any of you know, including himself."
@sammiekehoe it is! Kinda creepy. It's cool though. Nice to know other people think similar to me sometimes :P
Sometimes I feel like @sammiekehoe and I live a parallel life. She tweets about things that I'm thinking about and/or feeling constantly O.o
@rebeccamealy I waffle... Everyone really...
@QueenOfFangirls Glad you're making progress :) Keep at it!
I don’t want all our conversations to be serious.

......the elemelons
@purityprobs Yes. Great song.
@purityprobs If this is supposed to be lyrics from "Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop" I love you.
@Tricialee43 @cc_scott12 Caleb, why am I never invited to these creep fests? ;P
"@fitforakingband: "Your existence disgusts me." shirt, available this fall! 
Dinner after the WVs ball, beginning of this year. #Throwbackthursday 
"It breaks my heart when I see you hurting, I just want you to be healed. I will never stop praying for restoration." @MOTSmetal
Toy Story and The Walking Dead have the same story line. 
"He must become greater; I must become less.”
"We love because He first loved us." 

There's nothing we have done to make him love us less.
@edsheeran Don't leave usssssssss. :(
@Homeschoolah #IndeedLongHashtagsKindaLikeThisOneAreQuiteAnnoyingButYeahAnywayGoodnight
Why did I wait this long to get into Wavorly? Conquering the Fear of Flight is such a great album. Amazing music and lyrics.
I finally feel like myself after nearly three weeks. It's a good feeling. :)
@Homeschoolah #IDoIndeed #JustKidding #BarelyEverUseThem #ExceptRightNowForSomeReason
@Homeschoolah #forreal #whataretheythinking #homeschoolersarepeopletoo
@StephaniePowe17 @wolvesatthegate How you doin'? ;) :P
@Homeschoolah It's okay. Android is better. :D
@AmandaGresso We had to do actual plays in Mr. Tillman's class. It was fun, but so many lines...
If one evil thought, word, action, deserves eternal damnation, how many hells do I deserve? #methodofgrace #wonderfulsermon #feels #tears
So... Psalms 14:1-3 and 53:1-3 are literally exactly the same. O.o
@QueenOfFangirls I've noticed a strange gap in young homeschoolers recently though... Hmm... Conspiracy maybe?
@QueenOfFangirls AWW HECK NAW I AINT NO GUINNEA PIG
@QueenOfFangirls but... Homeschoolers are smarter... What even. 

My mom is saying the same thing about my siblings though. What's going on?
@QueenOfFangirls WHAT WHY NOOOOOO (Didn't mean to favorite this, sorry. Force of habit.)
@jrrydberg23 I'll do it! ;P
"I've tried to hide it, but I can't sleep at night Everything I think about makes me feel like a version of myself"
"Well they say that You make beauty out of ash, but something has to burn before You can."
@GraceVGrace Good! Your music is great.
Is telling someone "You're not fat enough to do that" a compliment or an insult?
@Homeschoolprob4 FREAKING YES OH GOSH
Can today just not? And tomorrow? And basically every day until Friday? Can they just all not? #Vacation #Readytogetoutofhere #forgetlife
Seriously guys, can someone teach me how to life? #itshard #helpme
"@LionelLoot: @oct2006 ill send you some luck fella" thanks :D
@sammiekehoe Life. How does it work?
If someone buys me Star Trek: Into Darkness I will love you forever.

@BlimeyCow "
Why am I watching a documentary about Movie Theaters? I work at one. -_-
Disguising mistakes with goodbyes is no way to truly live.

Oh wait it is a mood

Hahaha haha ha... help me

society: no not like that
"We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it."

Don't touch butts before you'…
@KC_katiecook Hey, you're pretty too. Don't say otherwise. :P
I feel a lot better now. :)
@maddie_taylor96 If they are truly worth it, they should not stay mad. Just give it some time and talk it out.
@maddie_taylor96 I know the feeling. Trust me. I felt exactly like you do very recently. You are not a mistake.
@maddie_taylor96 I've felt like that recently too, but you aren't. Don't say that.
@YATband Thanks!
@Homeschoolah My boat building skills are a bit rusty. It's been a few millenniums since I've built one. :P
@Homeschoolah Hahaha I have that thought a lot. "If I ran away, would I not have to do school anymore?" XD
@Homeschoolah And yeah. So much fun. :P
@Homeschoolah One step closer to finishing.

It's a pretty small step. But a step nonetheless. :P
WHAT, @MICAHLIKESLIONS (Lead singer of @weareohsleeper) IS ENGAGED!!! Happy for you man! :D
@Homeschoolah Totally meant affects. XD
@Homeschoolah HAH! I have a pencil. I win.
@Homeschoolah Worldviews here... Studying European charters and their affecs on colonial America. But really just scrolling Twitter. :|
Hey, @YATband, does the digital download of your EP have a digital booklet with lyrics? If not, is there a way I could get lyrics?
@Homeschoolah I'm sitting here right now staring at my syllabus and listening to music. I've been staring at this page for two hours now.
@Homeschoolah Oh my gosh, yes, it's awful. Can't focus on anything.
Is there a way I can auto-retweet everything @MOTSmetal tweets? If not, there should be.
I don't deserve the forgiveness offered to me though His grace. But I will accept it graciously. Lord, help me to be a better person.
My heart stopped 
and our pulse became the same.
Mom: "No! Don't come here! I said 'Here' I didn't say 'Come'!"

Wut. O.o
@KC_katiecook DO IT. I'll be here. :D
Haha. Yeah. This is totally me. It's encouraging, to say the least. :) 
It's time to take a step back and let things run their course. I am not in control. God is. It's time to start practicing what I preach.
New Harry Potter universe movie? #letsdothis. Time to reread every single book. Including side lore and encyclopedias. Again. #sodangexcite
Oh man. The feels.


So I finally tried one of the Salt Water Taffy pieces that @GraceVGrace gave me like a month ago and now I can't stop eating #helpme #please
If someone says "It's just music" one more time, I think I might go ballistic... #musichasmeaning

@SPN_updates is great.

Hitting on me at a funeral is a huge step over the line. Especially when I've already told you I'm not interested. A funeral though. Really?

@sammiekehoe Hehehe. Sounds like someone I know. :P
I wrote another thing. Less depressing this time. And now I can't stop. I know they're probably all awful, but I'm having fun! #helpme
It's kinda depressing though, so I'm not going to show anyone I know yet. Sorry :P
GUYS I DID A THING WITH A PEN AND PAPER THAT WASN'T A PAPER FOR SCHOOL THIS IS A BREAKTHROUGH FOR ME EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE VERY GOOD
I think I just wrote something...
Hey guys, pray for a neighbor of mine that got evicted today. I'm sure they could use it.
If I've done anything to offend or hurt you recently or in the past, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I forgive anyone who has done the same to me.
@GraceVGrace That's okay, my phone died too. Homework has taken over now. :P
@GraceVGrace it's really awful.
@GraceVGrace What did you figure out?!
@BlimeyCow retweeted me. Day made. :)
Just learned about "The Fault in Our Stars" movie. I am excite.
@GraceVGrace @SteeleAlex What did you do? :P
"@IAmElizaRuth: Probably one of my favourite @BlimeyCow videos yet. 
Guys, my friends are the best. :)
Guys, let's start a band.
@GraceVGrace I love my dog too. So much. I want to take him with me everywhere. Not feasible. But still. All the places. Ever.
At least I can trust my dog... XD
@MouthoftheButtz I WISH I COULD BE THERE HKSBDJKHWGBFIYSFBLJKBSDFSKJ
@stinsonsays: "At least mosquitos are attracted to me" I know, right? Seems like there's one in my bed every night. :P
The way me and my uncle text each other... 
I got my license plates today. 

Easiest license plate number ever. 

Slightly saddened by this. But kinda happy too.
@SteeleAlex That's like me with Boy Scout popcorn...
Is it weird that the days we don't talk seem longer? No? Just me? I guess it is weird. :P
I feel like I scare people away... What to do... I guess I could just not talk... That might work... #Mehdayyesterday #nosleep
@GraceVGrace Oh God, the ending.
"@QueenOfFangirls: I feel like watching classic Star Trek all night. Someone join meeeeeee. #mychildhood #trekkie" Let's go.
@QueenOfFangirls "I describe them as me if I were a pair of glasses" this is 100% true.
"@SteeleAlex: I finished my college essay 
@GraceVGrace :(

Don't listen to them.
"Just be my you, and I'll be your me." @JaggedRow
I'm really good at making friends... 

Not so good at keeping them... 

#sigh
@AmandaGresso @QueenOfFangirls Well that's good I suppose. :) Better than a full party pooper at the very least...
@AmandaGresso @QueenOfFangirls At first I was like D: Then I was like :D

I will be at homecoming though. So there's that. :D
@AmandaGresso @QueenOfFangirls I'm sooooooorrrrrrrrryyyyy. ;P
@AmandaGresso @QueenOfFangirls hehe. :3

But seriously. Not going this year. :P Have fun though! :D
@AmandaGresso @QueenOfFangirls Sorry, I don't think I'm going this year... 

:P
I rushed at work, got off an hour early, so I could sleep after feeling sick all day. I get home and I'm not even tired. ._. #ineedsleep
@QueenOfFangirls Not a Theo friend but it's April 12th
@SteeleAlex Story of my life right there.
Now we can't hold a conversation for 2 minutes.
Haha wow more. XD 
Oh, my siblings. I took a shower last night, but I'll take another shower when I feel better, I… 

@GraceVGrace haha I know, I was there for that part. :)
@GraceVGrace hey, you like it, and that's cool. I just don't really. :P

We are, at the very least, semi-different people you know. :P
@GraceVGrace Yessssss. Not a huge fan of the Marilyn one, but I loved the other one.
@GraceVGrace Which ones did you end up with? I missed it :/
@sammiekehoe Okay, I have to admit, I do like that song. When Year 3000 released I was like 10 and I was obsessed with it. Great cover.
@sammiekehoe Nooo. I mean, they're alright, and I do like some (very little) of their music. But this song... Not a fan.
@sammiekehoe FREAKING YES.
Realllllllly needed that sermon. Thankful that it was given. :)
Sigh. I feel like I've screwed up. :/
@SteeleAlex Yep.
@SteeleAlex You gotta apply first. :P
I'm actually really glad I went to work tonight. It turned out great. Had a lot of fun :)
@SteeleAlex, one of the new hires at AMC reminds me of you so much. Like oh my gosh. It's so weird. O.o
@GraceVGrace 

Poor David's Pub is a nice place too, but there might be an age restriction for preformers.
"The World's End: The British version of This Is The End without Emma Watson" The most accurate description I have ever seen.
@GraceVGrace Oh yes. So much fun. :P it's only part of a shift so that's good. I have to take a whole week off soon, so extra hours is nice.
@GraceVGrace Yup. Regretting. Oh well.
@GraceVGrace I regret my decision immensely.
@GraceVGrace Not the thing you're maybe thinking about. It was like 2AM and I decided it would be a wonderful idea to take a shift at work
...What was I thinking last night? Why would I do that? That was a terrible idea. I don't want to be there tonight. #baddecision #toolatenow
