@MissStaceyMay Well, I mean, the fedora thing is semi-organised, I think?
Students at Lillian Osborne and McNally made this great video on bullying and bystander intervention: 
It's real sad this FHRITP thing is so pervasive.

@rgay 
I wanna know how @rgay manages her mentions when her every tweet gets dozens of reactions.
Yep, definitely left that literary event because only dudes were reading.
I know of a few, but I want to hear about your experiences.
Which places have a suitable atmosphere (not too loud) and are capable at troubleshooting? Which have experience hosting readings?
#yeg Twitter: what are the best bars/restaurants you've been to for reading events? Poetry, prose, or otherwise.
I am sorry for my Twitter presence sometimes. I'm generally a happy/optimistic person. Twitter is where I go to be grumpy.
@marisasano But that's such a good opportunity for seven years of bad luck/writing fodder.
@jennygadget same (minus the asshole part)
@MissStaceyMay @mensah4000 Thanks for this. I want to work my way up to editing/collaborating, and this is good to keep in mind.
bored by irony
@mensah4000 This tension is something that's of huge interest to me, even in curator role. Where's the point when the editor shapes too much
@mensah4000 why?
Anyway, I know I'm a broken record. I'm hoping to add something to the Edmonton literary community within a few months or so.
Including women and POC is so easily achievable it's inexcusable not to make the effort.
The unavoidable response is "what about other marginalised people?" Which is valid. But we'll never achieve 100% inclusion.
I realise the lack of change my going or not going effects, but I feel that if your event lacks women or POC, it also lacks relevance.
Debating whether or not to go to a literary event tonight that may or may not include women authors—it's unclear.
@mensah4000 I've resigned myself to the idea that life is mostly dissatisfaction interrupted by brief periods of satisfaction.
By @sadydoyle, this piece on the failure of Age of Ultron and Marvel is excellent. 
.@vivekshraya throws the best literary events in Edmonton.
If you're in Edmonton, you should go to the Maginificent Malls of Edmonton launch at Capilano Library, 2:30pm.
My frustration with Edmonton's scene remains the same.
A friend tells me POC were involved in the process. I took a quick look at the highlights and made a misjudgment re: diversity of event.
I'm bored by bringing this up time and again. Edmonton has a serious race problem with public events.
How relevant is your event when every person highlighted is white?
I see another major Edmonton event hosted by white people gave awards to all white people.
*sound of many things hitting hard floor* *sounds of said things skittering across the floor*
By the sounds of it, my upstairs neighbour's cat is knocking shit all over the place.
Just watched a man ride by on some sort of bicycle/motorbike hybrid.
@grammar_girl @FracturCritical I have a special glare I reserve for drivers looking left only as they make a right turn toward me.
@shanley Ah, I missed that this was about public interventions specifically. Intervention in general can be complicated.
Looking for a Mother's Day gift for the mom who loves stories? Try Gone Girl. Prefers film? Surprise her with The Babadook.
@shanley Good questions. What's the alternative, assuming no existing relationship with either the target or the abuser?
@MissStaceyMay I finally read your tinyletter. You make baseball sound exciting! (Not that it isn't, it's just completely foreign to me.)
@nathanielrittne @vivekshraya Of course you did!
@vivekshraya Twice, if you're at Royal Bison. (You think I'd miss the event?)
@vivekshraya Don't feel bad! Fiction is what came to me and it just happened to lean toward non-fic, which is good.
Just sitting here like <NEUTRAL FACE>
Man who joined my table at this crowded cafe bursting out laughing, doubled over about something on his laptop.
So anyway, if you can make it to @theroyalbison, you probably won't be disappointed by picking up a copy of Magnificent Malls of Edmonton.
Thanks to his faith in me, though, the story I wrote was the first I'd finished in over a year. And that's really got me back into things.
.@vivekshraya urged me ad urged me to write something for MMoE—and I did!—but it was fiction and the collection is all non-fiction.
I'm lucky to be acquainted with @vivekshraya. Few people come close to being as kind or generous as him, and he has a talent for writing.
I'm really looking forward to reading @vivekshraya's Magnificent Malls of Edmonton.
Got my @Everlane backpack in the mail today and it is *beautiful*.
Biggest mistake today was only getting two of @sailinon780's tacos
You all need to read that story by @samahaliii. Happy it's in the new @fourculture issue. #lrt
The Moon soundtrack is so perfect.
@xtx33 You've convinced me.
@xtx33 Heh, I've been meaning to change it for a while.
@xtx33 Trick is to buy the smallest bag. Or one of those old 25 cent dispensers. (I have the latter at my job!)
@xtx33 I have a problem re: stopping when it comes to eating peanut M&amp;Ms.
When you work with marginalised communities but are also interested in media criticism, the term MSM causes brief confusion on occasion.
@mensah4000 My self-identity is messy (mixed-race, Indigenous), but I get this feeling. Do you feel the problem is getting better, though?
A dozen people have made the joke about PC hell freezing over by now, right?

I'll give it until 2:00 tomorrow before my general sense of malaise kicks in again.
I can't stop laughing at this 
Twitter friends, you are the greatest on nights like this.
@brennacgray All I can say is I hope that's not the case here. It's always struck me as a strange system that doesn't work well.
@brennacgray I'm maybe not the greatest person to ask. I hope so. But I don't know.
@brennacgray Absolutely. It's a broken system.
@CromartyHeather I AM SO HAPPY
Happy to see Colin Piquette elected in my hometown division. I've had the pleasure to work with him, and he's a very nice man.
If I were a different person, I'd be dancing on my Jasper Avenue-facing balcony, waving my NDP sign.
How am I ever going to sleep tonight?

@LouisatheLast Same. I'd hoped the first Avengers and Guardians were indicators of change. And they are, I think. Just not thorough change.
@LouisatheLast Yes. But they're making buckets of money, which is the bottom line for them I guess. :/
@LouisatheLast Yes. Also, to have cut that ridiculous Thor-in-a-pool scene. I can't believe Marvel fought so hard to keep that.
@teelough WHAT IS HAPPENING
This isn't real. right? I'm dead, right? Cold, buried in the ground, mind gone to mush? This can't be real.
I wrote this email to @RachelNotley in 2008. I was 20. 
Got off the phone with my mom. Couldn't help but gloat a little bit.
.@BrianJeanWRP I made an oopsie
BEAUTIFUL 
And here I am, sitting home alone, refreshing Twitter while this big thing happens. #insignificant #youcare
I'm gonna vomit.
A province that has, for DECADES, elected the right-wing party now has the left-wing party leading in the election results.
I want all my non-Canadian followers to understand just how momentous this election is right now.
Having a heart attack right now. #abvote
Maybe I'm extrapolating, but it made me fear for today's election results.
And she just kept walking.
At the grocery store today, a woman knocked a bunch of things over with her basket, stopped, looked right at me and said, "Oops. Wasn't me."
Must drink tonight. If this election brings change, it's a celebration. Otherwise, I'm drowning my sorrows.
@mensah4000 Nice to know the feeling is familiar. Edmonton feels so disconnected sometimes.
@scATX Only speculation so far, but from what I could gather many people criticised him for Black Widow's sexist portrayal in Age of Ultron.
There are loads of other people I can add to this list.
I'm so grateful for Twitter, but wish I could know people like @mensah4000, @iSmashFizzle, or @rgay offline. Edmonton can be so lonely.
Also grateful to the CRA, who accidentally gave Canadians an extra 5 days to file <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
With my NGO salary PLUS student loan interest PLUS RRSP contributions, I'm looking forward to that tax credit. <MONEY BAG>
Filed my taxes <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@mensah4000 They sort of make me feel like I'm just mashing them into my ears, too.
I also hope that when Spidey makes his appearance in a Marvel film, they skip over Peter and go straight to Miles.
I can't wait to see the Avengers tomorrow.
@MissStaceyMay If she just toned down the screaming a little...
Finally watched Interstellar last night. Realising I love watching really good hard sci-fi. It was great.
@mensah4000 saaaame
@Wordsin3D Thanks for the tip, I'll check out the magazine.
I've got 5 invites to This for whoever wants them.
@mensah4000 @ElectricLit Great work, mensah.
@LiseGot Heard you were great at the event last night.
Feeling very grateful this morning; received news I've been granted a bursary to attend @Wordsin3D. Looking forward to it.
Have I mentioned I'm reading literary submissions for @mensah4000 at @fourculture? You should send your stories there.
@coffee_consumer @fourculture Ouch. Good luck!
Whoops, that's @VeganRevoIution.
.@VeganRevolution is the garbagiest of all garbage twitter accounts
@mensah4000 Have yet to see it (I know). Would you recommend the soundtrack? All your other recs are spot-on.
A Tinyletter you should probably subscribe to, by @MissStaceyMay: 
I've downloaded @Miranda_July's @somebodyapp, but there are only ever like five users in my area, with week-old messages.
@MissStaceyMay oooh, exciting!
I am sorry to miss Feminism After Dark tonight, but a feminist event—with women I greatly respect—with no POC is not an event I can support.
Did anyone really need *another* reason not to drink Bud Light?
Lunch with @ChauLibrarian is always a good lunch, but especially so when it involves tacos.
@LouisatheLast I know the feeling. Glad you're taking a step back.
@LouisatheLast Take care of yourself. Hope all is well soon.
Despite the kindness and the love those we know may show, we can never know what horrible acts they may one day commit.
[TW] Learned an old colleague sexually assaulted someone. He is/was a kind, generous person, and he is/was capable of sexual assault.
@rlhazelwood This is a lovely series of tweets.
@farrah_khan Whole situation breaks my heart. Sorry for everyone involved.
@mensah4000 This is why I love reading for you.
It's worse than I thought <SKULL> 
Downloading tax software. Pray for me.
I hate trying to sell anything through Kijiji. People are so flaky.
Very short notice, but if any of you friends wants two comp tickets to Concrete Theatre's Routes at 7:30 tonight, DM me.
@scATX I have yet to get the new features, I guess? But yeah, seems like you'd use it very little.
@scATX Getting Things Done, a task management system.
@scATX Seems to be cues from GTD. Someday would be for things you'd like to get to eventually, but aren't important or timely.
@allisonkilkenny I guess when you live in a city where aliens come from a portal in the sky and a man turns into a giant green monster...
Never in my life did I think I'd say this, but this article in Playboy is an essential read: 
Ban problematic. We are all a mess.
@mensah4000 Give it time. You can be the lit squire for now or something.
@mensah4000 when all along, we already were
@EmilyRiddle Fair enough. I'll vote so long as this is the system, for better or worse.
@EmilyRiddle When you're limited to the current system, it's the best we've got, IMO. But I'd settle for anything that isn't PC/Wildrose.
@EmilyRiddle We can dream.
@grammar_girl Naturally.
@grammar_girl But that sounds amazing!
@Paulatics @Dani_DCFan @jengerson Also, very important difference between intent and impact.
Get Lonely is my favourite @mountain_goats album, contender for favourite album ever.
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>And when somebody asks if I'm ok
I don't know what to say<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@LouisatheLast You've convinced me.
At 18, I went to Ottawa w/ Forum Program and Brian Jean joined me for dinner. I was an outspoken leftie. It was awkward.
I hate not taking my own advice. There is only frustration to be gained from reading the convos with Murphy.
Change the conversation to games, and I bet Murphy sounds a lot like a GGer.
@marilynk_ No problem!
@marilynk_ Sorry, dish as in prepared meal, not as in vessel for food.
@marilynk_ Japanese is super rusty after years of disuse, but they're asking about chirashi, a kind of dish.
@NatalieZed @VIDA_lit faving for #ohnoetry
@mensah4000 Reconciling the past can be tremendously difficult. Best we can do is learn and avoid repetition, carry that regret best we can.
@mensah4000 Was literally just typing a tweet about how we can only do the best we can.
I wish I were so lucky to have a library built near my home.
Edmntn Journal cover story just has me imagining white people lamenting their property value, arms thrown in the air. 
@graceishuman @racialicious HOORAY! That's such great news!!
Just let Mark Ruffalo be forever wonderful.
She wrote back to explain her bf cheated on her with her sister, so she's no longer with him. Poor kid.
Wrote her an email saying she doesn't deserve that, gave her number to Kids Help Phone.
Selling an iPhone. Teen emails me, asks if I can sell it cheap, because she has little money and her bf threw/broke her phone.
@grammar_girl Sure is.
@grammar_girl I was listening to that this morning for the first time in MONTHS. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I saw a tweet where she claims the outrage at her is about Cox being a celebrity. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I will say this about Meghan Murphy: she is PRO at derailing and obfuscating critiques of her.
Getting affirmation today that blocking M. Murphy a year or two ago was a valid life choice.
Nap friends 
@MissStaceyMay oh no, what's going on now?
@rlhazelwood What writer wants the *easy* way? <SKULL>
@graceishuman Yeah, there are a few very violent moments yet to come. It's a *little* excessive.
@rlhazelwood Thanks for the advice. I was going to start from around the bottom, but submitted to a pub I enjoy, even if I have some doubts.
I've been telling myself I'm not ready to submit to a reputable mag. Challenging that self-doubt and submitting to one.
[Flips through Duotrope, judges your magazine's website design.]
There are just SO MANY literary publications.
As I look to submit a short story for the first time, how does one choose which publication to send it to? Aside from appropriate ones.
Today I'm on the road to Camrose with @ConcreteYEG and their play, Routes!
@alexiskienlen I mean, maybe the series wouldn't exclude white men 100%. Maybe one could read per night.
I think I've got a piece of fiction ready for publication. If I send it out, it'll be the first piece of fiction I've ever sent out.
I need more people on Gchat so I can put off writing some more.
@Wordsin3D The conference looks interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
@mensah4000 @darcco Haha, good idea.
@mensah4000 @darcco That is impressive.
@mazzie Not sure how it'd work, but fitbits sync to most phones now.
@mazzie I wondered the same thing. Might be useful if you're in a meeting and can't otherwise check your phone or something?
Weeknight at full coffee shop: there are maybe 3 people not staring into their Macbook.
I am more-than-half-seriously considering this. I don't personally know enough writers in Edmonton to make this work atm, though.
@mensah4000 Judging by the tweets, it looks like such a great time.
Hey @alexiskienlen, with the fave. HYPOTHETICALLY, think there's enough of a writer base to do this in Edmonton?
I want to start a reading series in Edmonton but like, have no white men read. Ever.
@KaterinaSymes Congrats!
@libraryyeti I'm sorry. Here is a picture of a dog. 
@skrishna It's really good.
@skrishna Great news!
What do you even do in this situation? Considering a private conversation about it.
When someone you care for and respect organises a feminist event feat. only white women. <PERSEVERING FACE>

4/20/15: Twitter: Hey guys, you want DMs from people you don't follow, …
@saladinahmed If it's any consolation, there's some good work bring done to rectify faulty solutions. E.g., by @WakingUpCourage
What starts off as a unique approach to superheroes on the screen devolves into ticking off checkboxes by the end.
A major reason I think Daredevil fell short? The pacing starts off *so right*, but speeds up to resolve the season.
@roymacIII I guess I'm wishing lapses in empathy and putting certain women down weren't mistakes anyone made.
@mensah4000 please don't crawl under a rock!
I haven't used Facebook in 5 years. Leaning toward keeping my account re-activated, but I have little idea how to navigate the site.
Deciding between whether I want a Facebook account for some of my local work or not rn. Uuuuggghhhh.
@omar_aok NDP majority
If you're not following @mensah4000 you probably should follow @mensah4000. Follow @mensah4000. @mensah4000.
@CromartyHeather I wish I could justify buying myself a bottle of scotch right now.
There are days—oh, there are days—when I wonder if it's where I should really be placing my focus.
Reading @mensah4000's writing gives me some much-needed self-confidence about the need to continue my own writing.
@JulieSLalonde Nothing to be sorry for at all.
@heartdashbeats <NAIL POLISH>
@JulieSLalonde Yes, it can be tricky. Important to have these conversations and act on feelings of hesitation.
@JulieSLalonde @MissStaceyMay @HollabackAB IMO, avoiding explicitness is key there.
@wagatwe Gently, preferably with food.
@wagatwe Mine stuck to behind the toilet at first! Won't like it, but if you can, pick him/her up and put them away for bed.
@JulieSLalonde @MissStaceyMay @HollabackAB TBH, easy: warn people beforehand, and give them an out (e.g. in a class, the option to leave).
@wagatwe Also, @DrJaneChi may have advice!
@wagatwe Lots of helpful info online. My advice? Give him/her a place to retreat to for now. They'll get curious and wander out in time. :-)
@wagatwe My bun does things I never would have guessed her capable of doing after many months. The comfort grows with time.
@wagatwe Be patient with them, sit on the floor with them, and in time, they'll be more comfortable!
@MissStaceyMay you're one of the best people.
@MissStaceyMay I think this is an especially important note that I hadn't given much thought to earlier today, tbh. Thanks for mentioning it
@HollabackAB If we are deemed worthy by @MissStaceyMay and she accepts a follow request, that will solve your problem. <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@MissStaceyMay Some of the work? Yes, safe to say it would be.
@MissStaceyMay ugh. Right?
@MissStaceyMay Yes, exactly. My only wish is for us all to empathise with anyone who might have an issue with the messaging.
@MissStaceyMay Absolutely. There's no way *every woman* would feel comforted by that. My hope is, many (most?) would.
And I guess my point is, if male allies make mistakes but accept the criticism that follows, it's not perfect, but it may be the best we get
I MADE MISTAKES GETTING HERE. And the men doing feminist acts will make similarly stupid, shitty mistakes that I made.
There is no way to not sound shitty saying this, but I feel I have deeply rooted knowledge and behaviour that makes me a good ally. BUT!...
And part of that is warranted. Kyle Payne. Hugo Schwyzer. But it's also something I need to do some personal work on.
I have a *lot* of skepticism about men self-identifying as feminists or allies and involving themselves in feminist work.
I was really disheartened and upset by what I heard today. But I also believe the message got through.
I started doing explicitly feminist work in 2007. And I know I made mistakes. I was called on a few. And it was hard, but it helped me grow.
But anyway, the legitimacy of the action isn't what this is about. It's about involving men in feminist work and the mistakes they will make
and then she's mocked for it. Like, that's so obviously cruel and hypocritical to me.
many people in the group were out there writing messages about safe spaces, and here was a woman vocalising her uneasiness with the thing...
Which, like, I cringed. Because now I was going to have to be *that guy* giving a lecture. SO I explained to him that actually...
Anyway, there were a few people on that particular block that gave us trouble, and later, one of the men commented on all the "horrible" ppl
They withdrew right away. They didn't have any ill intent. Which is good. I feel it's an obvious thing to avoid, though. Maybe I'm wrong.
When I saw this, I said to them it actually wasn't our discussion to have. It was not the role of men to convince her this was good for her.
@dcwarwick Anyway, two of the men on the walk engaged with her. I didn't catch all of it, but they were explaining the good of our actions.
She explained she didn't want it in her face. Again, very upset.
At one point, there was a woman who was quite distressed by what we were doing. She didn't want to see the anti-harassment messages.
After the Hollaback Chalk Walk, thinking about men's involvement in feminist action (my own included).
I hope as many people watched the Star Wars trailer as I thought did when I wrote this.

@MissStaceyMay Oh same. Like, to each their own. I'm just wanted imagining the convos at grandparents upcoming 60th anniversary.
@MissStaceyMay The next family gathering will be interesting. (Stoll is never there, but you know, the grandparents like to talk.)

@ScottMadin Not sure about that last part, but that's how the annual reviews go where I work. I'm certain that's far from standard, though.
Okay, that Star Wars teaser has washed away the last bit of skepticism I've had since this film was first announced.
For outsiders, the Wildrose party is Alberta's party on the extreme right. We look forward to gaffs like this every election.

@jonny_is_good @scATX This is using "yummy" as a noun, right? It's not just me?
@Wordsin3D Yes. Big loss.
I've been kinda looking for something since Other Voices folded, where I was nonfiction editor for its final few months.
Very happy to say I'll be reading submissions for @mensah4000 and @fourculture.
@grammar_girl You are wiser than me. (It was good, though!)
@grammar_girl Gravity was an exercise in managing my anxiety.
@mensah4000 But you could start there. I suspect Transcendental Youth is a great place to start, too. (Amy, AKA Spent Gladiator is perfect.)
@mensah4000 Beat the Champ is v. good, but I initially found the wrestling vocabulary limited my full appreciation.
@mensah4000 *forever recommends people to listen to @mountain_goats*
@mensah4000 IIRC, it slumps around there and then gets better again.
@mensah4000 (Fingers crossed Ant Man is a step toward that based on the trailer.)
@mensah4000 Right? Marvel still has a way to go toward figuring out action scenes that aren't mostly tedious.
@cheuya Have these dudes even SEEN that movie?
Someone's probably made a bad MRA blue pill joke before, yeah? I'm like two years late?
MRAs have all taken the blue pill of shitbaggery.

@MissStaceyMay @neville_park  ...or doesn't go on panel, IIRC. Bit of a different situation here. Maybe @jennpozner has suggestions?
@MissStaceyMay @neville_park Reminds me of @jennpozner's approach to panels without adequate PoC—she works to find speakers...
@skrishna I know it's strange commenting on a 6-day-old tweet, but I can geek on on this stuff *forever*. (Currently rearranging OF myself.)
I'm completely overhauling OmniFocus today and that's a lot more fun than it sounds.
I miss the Garneau Sisterhood.
@ScottMadin Chinos are a great way to change up your pants, too, IMO.
@ScottMadin Lots of great colourful dress shirts out there. I stick to checkered shirts, mostly, and there's good variety.
@grammar_girl @ScottMadin Thanks. :-)
@grammar_girl @ScottMadin Anyway, bow ties, Scott! I'd trust Melanie.
@grammar_girl @ScottMadin My partner convinced me to wear one for our upcoming wedding, and tbh I *did* like it.
@grammar_girl @ScottMadin I don't understand the trend in bowties, but I have been slightly intrigued by them myself.

@mensah4000 Definitely worth watching.
@LouisatheLast Hahahahaha, yes, exactly.
I realise the fighting is necessary in something like Daredevil, but it's also the least enjoyable part of the series.
Watching Daredevil, I want more longform superhero dramas. Starting with Banner/Hulk, maybe. But like, mostly just Banner.
@LilyBolourian Where "suspicious" = "fucked up"?
@whoa_parker And that's maybe in part because queer and trans youth have begun to challenge many gendered assumptions.
@whoa_parker Worth noting the problems I outlined earlier I've only come across in groups of (assumed) heterosexual, cisgender youth.
@whoa_parker Agreed, and excluding trans youth is unacceptable. Obvious partial solution is allowing youth to self-identify.
Four episodes in and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying Daredevil.
I'm kind of bored by Daredevil as a character tbh, but I'm curious about this series. It was maybe the film that ruined him for me.
@dcwarwick Which is a sad reality, really. But it's almost always white people.
I'm more than a little excited I have a non-white candidate running in my riding who probably has my vote.
@ScottMadin That song in on repeat in my head today.
I love Darnielle's ability to take a subject that seems kind of silly to me as an outsider and create a deeply affecting song out of it.
A heel turn being when a good guy (babyface) embraces villainy, basically. (Heel=villain)
Heel Turn 2 may be one of my favourite Mountain Goats songs now, made better when you know what a heel turn is: 
After learning some wrestling lingo, I have a deeper appreciation for many songs on Beat the Champ.

@NatalieZed @MissStaceyMay My hope is this helps anyone who isn't a complete asshole see real work needs to be done to address these issues.
@MissStaceyMay @NatalieZed Oh fuck.
Today is a good day for this song 
I love this article, and @rachsyme's thoughts to go with it.
"...'chill' has become one of the most desirable qualities in a romantic prospect. But it is a garbage virtue." 
@marisasano I'm not *that* busy. I'm basically free for an hour any weekday and almost any night or weekend!
@marisasano It's something I remind myself in tougher times. Thanks. I also need to email you. Sorry I am terrible at email sometimes.
@dcwarwick (Oops, "consequences" in 2nd tweet should be "conversations".)
Just some thoughts. Anyway, I'm still looking for men interested in having these conversations with young men/boys. I can train you.
When you have the groups together, there's a lot of posturing and it's more difficult to have a deep and meaningful conversation.
WIth the boys, it's teaching them to challenge some of the attitudes and behaviours they've been taught.
*Every time* I work with girls/young women, there's a realisation they've been subjected to emotional abuse, at least.
Typically, you're having a different conversation with marginalised boys than you are with girls.
Boy/girl are crude categories, yes, but I've been learning you can have deeper, more effective consequences in homogenous groups.
I've come to a realisation that when talking with marginalised youth about healthy relationships, it's best to split groups by gender.
I'm loving seeing Chavo Guerrero tweet about Beat the Champ.
I hit a pothole--on Jasper Ave!--and got a flat tire this morning.
It was basically hours upon hours of nasty masculinity on display.
@dcwarwick Okay, I liked Dutch and Claudette. But they're almost the only likable characters in the entire series.
I never mentioned I spent the last while watching all 7 seasons of The Shield thinking it had to get better at some point but it's all bad.
(For real, we are going for a @mountain_goats song as the first song, though.)
Emily and I joke sometimes about playing @mountain_goats's No Children as first song at our wedding. We worry what the guests would think.
Nice to see Alberta in the news for the upcoming election and for Marilyn Manson being assaulted at a Denny's. #HomeSweetHome
@MissStaceyMay @mensah4000 Only the second half was a joke(?). Dudes gotta be dudes, find explanations for these terrible numbers.
So like, take me on to your lit mag as a volunteer to do your editing and administrative work you hate doing.
Speaking of the @VIDA_lit count, I want to get to a place where I can help women get published more, but I need skillz.
@mensah4000 noooooooo
@annaJGG That makes sense to me. Part of why I also liked Brazil was because my best friend at the time did, too.
You should listen to and/or buy @mountain_goats's Beat the Champ.
@annaJGG No, this is awesome! I have no experience beyond cheering for Brazil in soccer as a child. (Because they had Ronaldo and they won.)
@AliKira Makes sense. I'm sure a lot depends on the person.
Something I've never understood about sports: how do you pick a team to cheer for? Other than hometown loyalty? Serious question.
Too bad about Lynch leaving Twin Peaks. What is TP without Lynch?
@ScottMadin I figure some of us were just meant to be appreciators.
@ScottMadin SAME
It Follows: regressive sexual politics aside, the best new horror film I've seen in years.
It Follows is playing in Edmonton but none of my friends can bear horror.
@mensah4000 @iSmashFizzle Cheering you both on from the other side of the continent.
@DavidFutrelle You, Sir, have a talent for titles.
News article, on 118 Avenue: "Highlights: Grime and gentrification in artistic balance." Ew.
@whynotanna That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
It's funny seeing people quote @mountain_goats on Twitter, though: "I will personally stab you in the eye with a foreign object" etc. etc.
"Foreign Object" is a clear fan favourite on Beat the Champ, but "Legend of Chavo Guerrero" is my personal fave, I think.
@grammar_girl The lack of empathy is really something.

Looking for contributors to essay series on gender + sports. We pay $100/submission. 

Get @ me ASA…
@imjasondiamond Did he find the animal in his sandwich unlikeable?
@ScottMadin @mountain_goats It had me in fits on first listen.
There is no feeling like listening to a new @mountain_goats album for the first time.
@MissStaceyMay @vivekshraya See, I think writers have a responsibility to do so, but also to do so *well*, which is where the trouble is.
Today, I'm talking to Grant MacEwan University students about bullying prevention, with a requested emphasis on cyberbullying.
A strange thing is apps, games, etc. marketed as "addictive."
@DrDotEspelage Great work on the webinar today. Working in violence prevention, it's so useful to learn about your research
@DrDotEspelage Looking forward to your talk this afternoon!
Tonight I'm doing a workshop with newcomer parents about how they can support their children involved in bullying. #LoveMyJob
@ActionFlickDoc I've loved seeing the work of the students. Great work, all of you!
@brennacgray Those are only the people committed to undermining women's claims. Please remember there are many of us who believe you.
@phunphunphun YES
@phunphunphun That's the thing. Or branching out and doing the same work, but not in affiliation with the org.
@phunphunphun My tendency is also to believe allegations. Now considering benefits/drawbacks of my involvement. Won't contribute to abuse.
@phunphunphun I've considered that. It's in international org, though, and accusations are directed at HQ, not sites.
I guess the issue is a little more complex than that, or it would be an easy answer.
What do you do when the org you've signed up to volunteer for begins to face serious accusations of abuse on Twitter? :/
@ScottMadin Thanks! I've seen that mentioned somewhere before.
@ScottMadin Ah, okay. What mythos novel would you recommend to start with? Curious about both.
@ScottMadin Okay. That makes some sense. (I have nearly zero knowledge of Lovecraft.)
@ScottMadin Thanks!
@ScottMadin BTW, I've been meaning to ask: if I were to pick up Lovecraft, where should I start?
@ScottMadin Not sure if you know about this, but it seems up your alley. 
Seriously considering going to that HBO casting call for Indigenous extras.
@MissStaceyMay As in "fuck gender correctness?"
@aeazel Please include reply-all etiquette
@radicalbytes And games about hugging can be great! 
@CromartyHeather @marisasano @lilytsui Lucky! I recall joking with my host family about the name. (I was 17, okay.)
@CromartyHeather @marisasano @lilytsui I remember Collon from my time in Japan, and it's DELICIOUS
Re: my tweets yesterday about training men to talk to boys about healthy relationships, see link in previous tweet for more info.
We Need to Talk to Boys - I make it a general rule not to talk about my job online, though I sometimes talk... 
I know William Gibson &amp; Fans have enjoyed Chappie, but have any of you seen it? Was it good?
Mulder and Scully investigate claims of a mutant GamerGater only to discover they are all mutants.
The X-Files was such a huge thing in my youth. Excited to see it come back.
@ScottMadin @grammar_girl The product may be bad, but I'm ready for some NOSTALGIA
@grammar_girl @ScottMadin Yes, SHHHH Scott.  SHHHHH
@EmilyRiddle Very different cultures, huh?
@EmilyRiddle What are the main differences you've noticed?
@scATX Agreed. More action needed, but if these men are role models in their community, it sends an important message, IMO.
*they screw up*
*discards them and repeats the process*

hey im social media
@SamKriviak Thanks Sam!
Stop debating trigger warnings. Stop trivialising what some people need for their well-being.
@NYMag cc @FEDUPYEG
@heartdashbeats (thanks) Hoping I find some good men to work with on this.
@heartdashbeats no you
Who are the feminist-minded men I should be talking to in Edmonton who may be interested in this project? #yeg
I am working on some ideas to get young-ish men talking to boys about healthy relationships, violence prevention, etc.
Showed up to a focus group tonight. They sent me and another man away, with our $80. <MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG>

@marisasano <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@marisasano @marilynk_ She's the best. Well, there'll definitely be a lot of competition, but I've got my fingers crossed for you.
@marisasano Oh noooo :-(
@marisasano 
@ntlk Oooooohhhhhhhh.
@rgay Your UPS guy piece is a sure bet.
@scATX My partner really liked Aaron's mouse/rat story.
@iSmashFizzle @LatoyaPeterson I'm doing good work, uniting you two from the other side of the continent at my computer.
@LatoyaPeterson @iSmashFizzle Haha, you two are totally tweeting about the same old dude in a fur coat.
Just another day 
I just get frustrated that everything stops there most of the time. Is that the best men can do?
(See prev RT.)
Been doing a lot of thinking lately about the lip service paid to men doing feminist work. Like, everyone *talks* about men doing the work.
@rgay I did this same thing except I bussed halfway across my city and walked into a meeting before I realized. Thanks for sharing humility.
@marisasano Right? She's bound to get a million submissions but it's worth a shot when she announces the position.
@marisasano 
@marisasano As far as competition, well, don't do it if it's a young white dude.
@marisasano I don't think needing a mentor necessarily precludes being someone else's mentor. I think you can offer a lot of insight.
@marisasano I think you'd be a great mentor.
CONGRATS TO @RGAY FUTURE RULER OF EARTH
@temposabatier @KiraCochrane Good work, both of you, and to your unnamed collaborators. It's great to see WGS students making noise.
@beingbrina Damn, I log in to Twitter to see you putting up with more BS.
@thelindywest Yeah, "memoir" has a lot of weird baggage tied to it.
@JulieSLalonde 
@CatG138 I hope it goes well! NERD STUFF!
@beingbrina You have so much patience.
My first-ever radio interview was with Laura Kipnis.
Catching up on @callyrgf, @aminatou has me thinking I need to get rid of at least half of my books.
@ScottMadin (Surprise!)
I'm also considering a moderate return to Twitter. There are parts I miss.
Finally settled into 2015. Getting my literary game on.

@marisasano Facebook was... not good for me. I'm on Tumblr, otherwise email is best. (I'll DM you address.)
@parkersmuse Thank you. I'll still be around some places. And I'll miss our interactions, too.
@amaditalks You too. :-)
@parkersmuse yeah. If moderation weren't an issue for me, that'd be a good solution.
@amaditalks derekwarwick. I'm following you!
I'll continue writing on Tumblr. Hope to see some of you there. The ride has been good, but I think it's time for me to end it.
But I will miss the people on Twitter. You're the reason I've stayed. I hope to catch you in other spaces, online or otherwise.
I also don't feel like I have anything meaningful to contribute. It's not the medium for me anymore.
Everything is a mess and Twitter exacerbates it for me. It's overwhelming. There is a lot of anger, but then there's a lot to be angry about
I think I need to leave Twitter again for a while, maybe a long time, maybe forever.
Trying to decide what to do with the fact that I'm happier without Twitter.
@MissStaceyMay this is the worst fucking week after a series of worst fucking weeks.
@alexiskienlen I'm more than a little amused that Maynard James Keenan is a big part of that doc. (I was into Tool like many boys in HS.)
@DaniParadis But who would want to??
@DaniParadis Fewer is correct, because you could theoretically count them. Think "fewer blades of grass"--you'd never count them though.
@iSmashFizzle really enjoying Women in Clothes so far.
Lissey's pretty cause she eats her greens 
@marisasano Oh, it's great. And funny! It would be so unnerving to be on edge like that.
Great answer in Women in Clothes @marisasano!
@amirightfolks That sounds AMAZING
@scATX :-(
When you call out an artist for their all-white project with hopes the next one won't be and are ignored, what's the next non-asshole move?
I'm quiet because I feel ill about this, but all of you should really just read @MissStaceyMay's feed. #youknowhername #RehtaehParsons
The project is really cool, @bellyofawhale, but can we get something other than an all-white lineup in the next round?
@ShaunKing This is terrible. Have you tried reporting it with this new tool? 
@graceishuman @GeeBrunswick If this were me, that would be an lolsob
@AnnieKNK Like, leave her alone already. But you're right—they like to latch on to specific women and stay there.
@AnnieKNK The fact this continues *after* harassment has reached the level of threats, offline safety measures, etc., is even more worrisome
@NatalieZed but I see up to 16 cheese slices there
@grammar_girl I'm pretty envious right now!
@grammar_girl Happy birthday!!! Hoping it's a wonderful day for you.
@talkwordy And it's really good! Most of the time.
@melindamattos Sorry to hear that. *Those* meetings are the worst.
LOL @ gamergaters/dudebros spamming that Time Magazine poll
@melindamattos What? Every meeting doesn't feel like this?
@rgay A good friend of mine uses the same joke when random folks gawk in restaurants.
@Ramou You should! I cannot recommend IJ for its monstrousness, mostly, but ELSIAGS is the best biography I've read and recommend it to all.
@Ramou Have you read any other DFW? Or Every Love Story is a Ghost Story? I *really* think the latter is necessary before attempting IJ.
@iSmashFizzle @simongdunham (I recommend reading Every Love Story is a Ghost Story before attempting Infinite Jest. Provides motivation.)
@iSmashFizzle @simongdunham It was a slog at times, but also has some of the best moments I've ever found in a book.
Time Magazine continues its timeless irrelevance.
@omar_aok It isn't to me. There's a lot of work to do. Higher populations may also increase the racism. Not certain though.
@omar_aok hahaha
@omar_aok That's an award-winning euphemism there
@teresatothemax Fingers crossed that's a *very* temporary state.
@teresatothemax If there's any support you need, let me know. I've worked in workplace harassment and discrimination prevention.
@teresatothemax This pisses me off. I don't think you crossed any lines.
@teresatothemax Aw, shit. I was hoping it was an on-the-side thing.
@teresatothemax Maybe it was the working with startup bros comment. I'm sorry. Sounds like it isn't much of a loss aside from paycheck?
@teresatothemax What? Nooooo.
@hunktears Dunno about his sexuality, but Daniel Radcliffe seems pretty great?

I haven't paid attention to the Giller Prize since I was tricked into slogging through Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures. #youcare

@stygldpnyby Can't they just settle somewhere ELSE? Why does it have to be Edmonton?

I ordered 3 of Davis Rogan's records today. I haven't got music in the mail since I ran my podcast in 2006.

@mustbetuesday Gotta say you were wonderful at Loud &amp; Queer this weekend. Definitely one of the highlights of the night.
@grammar_girl @TheToast RIGHT?
@rgay if it's any consolation, your writing adds a lot to people's lives, mine included. The world is a better place for it.
@rgay Ugh. What a shitty thing.
There is no ManWhoreWalk #misandryisreal
@mopheadf Hahaha
@mopheadf What motivates *you*?
@mopheadf Also the right music. Got an "Upbeat" playlist for motivation; listen to Eno's 1/1 from Music for Airports on repeat to calm down.
@mopheadf Reading a LOT
Been listening to Trombone Shorty almost non-stop since discovering him through Treme 
Opening up season 4 of Treme to see there are only 5 episodes and not 10 is THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT
@marisasano Fingers crossed for you, whatever it is.

We got the guy. 


Hell yeah. I got Peeta Mellark of “The Hunger Games”. Who Is Your Young Adult Literature Boyfriend? 
So Joyce Carol Oates will be in Edmonton this month and I kind of wish her Twitter never existed.

@graceishuman The general philosophy of supporting children through meaningful consequences can be applied in other areas.

I've been feeling very grateful for @rgay's writing lately. She makes the world a bigger place, which is a great thing.
@EmilyRiddle Thank gawd for Google Maps, right?
@graceishuman I grew up in a town with a lot of ACDC fans.
@graceishuman lol. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.
@graceishuman You know which song the oldies rock stations are all playing tomorrow.
On Lena Dunham and All That - roxanegay: I have been asked about my thoughts on Lena Dunham, so here they... 
@teresatothemax *waits for it to show up on the internet*
@mallelis @zurilian What is a good amount to tip? I never know.
@ScottMadin Yes. There are always reasons underpinning behaviour. "That person is evil/bad" is hardly an acceptable explanation.
@ScottMadin There's real danger in labeling people abusers. It gives them no space to change. We need to focus on changing the behaviour.
@ScottMadin The work I do in bullying prevention and healthy relationships makes that distinction very clear.
@BastardKeith Sitcom or serious drama? @emilynussbaum has a name for the former.
Sincerely referring to someone as your "fearless leader"
@graceishuman Awesome. I just hope everyone had a pleasant weekend. The world has been hell lately.
@graceishuman Is there a good thing that happened with your weekend? *crosses fingers*
@graceishuman I *really* needed it.
@graceishuman I slept a lot and watched Treme.
One thing remains clear to me re Dunham issue: we need to have conversations with young children about appropriate v inappropriate touching.
#LRT is an important point. Oversharing is an issue writers need to grapple with. And Dunham crossed a line for many people there.
FWIW, @rgay has had the most measured response I've seen, though.
Really interested in the outrage re: Lena Dunham. Personally, I'm not voicing any opinion.
@mallelis Have you watched Treme? I really like Zahn in that.
Beat part of my MRA costume: groups of dudes muttering "not all men?" to themselves in confusion.
@graceishuman or, you know, try to.
@graceishuman And generous, thoughtful people lead the same sort of lives. :-)
@BeingKimmie LIIIEEESSS
@zoewhittall I'm real sorry to hear that.
@ScottMadin LOL. I feel you there.
Well this is horrifying 
My daughter always thinks outside the box :) 
Even has a tattoo sleeve... &lt;3 
#HappyHalloween 
OMG, these costumes. This is the best day of the year.
Video: annfriedman: "I will not ruin the sanctity of that character.” A Halloween tradition 
@marilynk_ I'm sure it will! I won't always need it, but when I'm stressed out I have lots of pain in my jaw.
@marilynk_ Yeah. I think it's a temporary solution. I should go to the dentist and get a proper one.
I bought a night guard cause I've been grinding my teeth again. I'm just gonna drool over EVERYTHING in my sleep, aren't I?
@OldCrowNest Completely understandable. A lot is going on right now.
@parkersmuse Really though, I think I'll just carry a sign that says Not ALL Men. I'm lazy and need something simple.
@parkersmuse LOLOL
@ScottMadin @grammar_girl I spent last year in and it was a real pleasure reading everyone's tweets.
@OldCrowNest Sorry, Twitter lumps users who RT'd into replies. Didn't know you were speaking from experience--won't question that.
Remember that Halloween thing @ScottMadin, @grammar_girl, et. al. did last year? That was fun.
@OldCrowNest @Jamiejhagen Is it though? I see it more as the responsibilisation of targets. Which is still a problem, of course.
@parkersmuse I can butt into conversations complaining about the Friend Zone and mansplain something.
I wish I had an ill-fitting Fedora so I could just go as an MRA for Halloween.
This world can feel so small, but then I realise I haven't registered someone like @HeerJeet before. The world is big and wonderful.
@ldobsonhughes @dreahouston At risk of sounding like a mansplainer, according to Canadian law, it'd be called sexual assault.
@graceishuman Yes, must echo @newskepticx on sexual assault law here. I've noticed that absence as well. Strange.
@LouisatheLast I wish I could visit your bakery! It looks like you're doing a wonderful job.
Maybe I'll go as a Gamergater and just carry around a sign that says "Actually, it's about ethics in games journalism."
I'm not gonna pull my Log Lady costume together in time. Trying to think of other ideas for a lazy Halloween.
@scATX short version: let's be kind, open, etc. to Jian. But his targets? Meeehhhh.
@multikaren It's a thing a lot of people are joking about doing.
If you're thinking of dressing up as Ghomeshi or his teddy bear for Halloween, you're an asshole.
@pipingloud I didn't look until you mentioned it. Sorry to see there wasn't more skepticism from the start.
Ghomeshi can keep his statement short and simple: affirm his accusers are telling the truth.
@femfreq You were great! Just what I needed to end an awful day like today.
Remember when that xoJane piece on Ghomeshi came out last year? If you disbelieved the allegations even then, own that.
Jian Ghomeshi assaulting 8 women should horrify us, but it's not an anomaly.
Remember what we know about perpetrators of sexual assault: few do it, but those who do do it repeatedly.
@ScottMadin @Pyrodon28 Wow! Congratulations both of you!
(Don't) Fuck Jian Ghomeshi.
@HollyOrd everyone's got to have those days sometimes.
@MissStaceyMay @HeerJeet You're right.
@MissStaceyMay @HeerJeet ...admire, and trust. They are charming. And we need to believe women when they accuse these men.
@MissStaceyMay @HeerJeet Sadly, yes. I'd love to see a broad discussion re: perpetrators of sexual assault are sometimes ppl we love...
@MissStaceyMay @HeerJeet Agreed. I think we're united in our loathing of this man.
@EmilyRiddle I agree completely. I think we're working with different definitions of "reasonable". By all means reclamation OUGHT to happen.
@HeerJeet ought to have known from the start. That there were signs.
@HeerJeet Danger in dehumanising perpetrators of sexual assault. He is a dangerous person yes. Monster? That term leads to belief we...
@EmilyRiddle there is just so much work to be done.
@EmilyRiddle Agreed. But is land reclamation a reasonable expectation in this world? In small ways, maybe. Beyond that, not sure.
@EmilyRiddle On anything more than a small, symbolic scale? I have serious doubts we'll ever get there.
@EmilyRiddle Nope. I'd hope we'd see a lot more empathy, though.
Advice: don't trust people who backed Jian Ghomeshi. REALLY don't trust people who still do.
@parkersmuse Irish all-day breakfast tea
I cannot imagine having to see the man who assaulted you day after day and widely beloved by your country.
@evhornbeck Thank you. I agree, it's a sort of relief to have the CBC doing this coverage. Difficult listening, too.
@evhornbeck Is this a different woman from the woman who spoke to As It Happens?
@veronicaeye @deanna Is it cause she's awesome? (It's cause she's awesome.)
@radicalbytes Or maybe more of us just need to put on our big boy pants.
@juliacarriew My sister was hiding beneath my bed so she could scare me. I moved a bag and almost died when I saw a pair of feet.
Too bad about @walrusmagazine. I know a mag isn't made up only of its editor, but it's difficult for me to keep the two separate.
I need to make more of an effort not to express anger and righteousness on here. It's the main reason I needed a break.
ONCE. Do it ONCE. Do not harass someone to the point they begrudgingly accept your effort at saving face.
“We have reached out to him numerous times...hoping that he will accept our invitation to meet...and apologize to him in person.”
If you're gonna kick an Indigenous person out of your mall cause he's Indigenous, at least apologise right. 
@KrisLigman LOL, why would you do that.
I appreciate this post by @owenpallett: 
@la_panique If it's just 'cause, Y. If they're drowning in an ocean of stress and anxiety, fire won't work.
@marisasano Please do! I also just saw their posting for their summer youth camp director and thought of you.
@marisasano I'd love to see you read. Is it in Edmonton?
@grammar_girl @scATX This is great.
@scATX I hope you find some confidence within some of those. They boost me when I need it.
@scATX Spoon, The Underdog; The Unicorns, Emasculate the Masculine; Manitoba, Twins (most bad-ass drumming ever)

@brokeymcpoverty That's a good one!
@parkersmuse Gamergate especially cannot go away soon enough.
@parkersmuse It's a lot, isn't it? Never-ending bullshit.
@teresatothemax teresa on the prowl
@parkersmuse I think it is. Willful ignorance coupled with male entitlement?
@parkersmuse I can't grasp why many dudes don't understand how, even with good intentions, they can come across as a threat.
WHERE CAN I GET A LOG FOR MY LOG LADY HALLOWEEN COSTUME
@DavidFutrelle you're not being FAAAAIIIIIR, david.
@hopelarson Glad the summer version is gone for the year. (Please let me stop sweating before this meeting, etc.)
@teresatothemax It's not surprising. Lotta people hanging onto their narratives.
@teresatothemax Oh no. Is there a discussion happening around that video that isn't "what can we do to stop this?" or something else?
@Nicole_Cliffe @juliacarriew *secretly glad The Toast wasn't around in my early 20s*
@mopheadf I'd love to see a good Hulk movie.
@iSmashFizzle NEVER
Civil War should be real good too. No Black Widow, though? Ridiculous.
I just got REAL excited for all these upcoming Marvel films. (CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!!!)
@MissStaceyMay Edmonton's got a way to go, but it's picking up over here. ;-)
@hunktears ugh, that's awful. I'm sorry to hear that.
@andrhia Hah! Maybe I'll familiarise myself again before NaNoWriMo starts up.
Toronto, I'm sorry your results weren't better, but you still avoided the worst case scenario. So there's that.
@BastardKeith Right? Social media makes winter here a little more bearable.
@mccanner !!! That looks incredible.
@andrhia Yeah, I think you're right. I'm sure I'd like it after using it for a while.
@andrhia Ah, thanks. I've got it but the complexity overwhelms me when I try to use it.
@andrhia what program is that?
i have some more thoughts re: Ghomeshi that I might write out tonight. Rushed to post my thoughts during my lunch break.
@teresatothemax a proper breakfast will do wonders. Coffee, too.
Like, I can't imagine any piece of evidence that could confirm every sex act with three people had been consensual.
Did anyone else find this Ghomeshi statement off? "I voluntarily showed evidence that everything I have done has been consensual."
Canada Man - Jian Ghomeshi became known to me as someone to pay attention to back when he did that really... 
@teresatothemax If talking to a semi-random internet stranger helps, I can always make myself available on Gchat.
@NatalieZed @la_panique Oh no. Hope all is okay, Natalie. :-(
@MissStaceyMay @ElizabethMay Are you serious.
@teresatothemax Hoping it gets better for you, and soon.
@grammar_girl If you're gonna read a summary, that's the one to read.
@graceishuman @RachelCraves Still, the fact it has raised nearly twice its goal of $5,000 disturbs.
Nothing annoys me more than persistent, unchecked irony. 
@DistrictCoffeeC DO NOT TEMPT ME
@teresatothemax :-(
Damn, is the Toronto election today already? My thoughts are with you all.
There are women who did not trust Jian Ghomeshi and warned each other about him. What you do with that info is up to you.
I don't want to tweet much about Jian Ghomeshi, but I will say this:

@m_kopas I had that how to draw cartoons book as a kid!
@decider @tylercoates @channingtatum cc @rgay
@SheilaHeti Also, while we're talking, I gotta say your writing is a true pleasure to read.
@SheilaHeti Now we made the mistake of buying wicker baskets for storage. Bunny LOVES those.
@SheilaHeti kinda, I guess. Just need to find some things to fill them with.
@MarcFaletti Real issue is the lack of journalism in games ethics tho
@hunktears "what are you smiling about?"
@SheilaHeti Mostly keep books on higher shelves. But then, maybe this question was rhetorical.
@SheilaHeti As a person with a bunny companion, I can relate to this problem.
@Ramou :-(
@DavidFutrelle You're killin me.
@BariLeia 
@TheLincoln Halloween's next week, man.
@grammar_girl @PublishersWkly Another 45 minutes dedicated to the love triangle everyone LOVED in the Desolation of Smaug.
@mallelis Made my favourite cake for my b-day, and brought it in to the nice restaurant where we had dinner. Asked staff to cut &amp; serve.
@mensah4000 I'm excited for it. Ultron will be a great villain.
@DavidFutrelle and/or subscribe to "any publicity is good publicity".
@mensah4000 Ooooh, will need to watch at home.
It's like AVFM *wants* to be sued. 
The world develops a lethal intolerance to ableist language, listeners silently fall over and die. #LameApocalypses
@jaclynf @grrlinthecity TOTALLY deserved. Like, this isn't surprising at all to some of us on the outside.
@emkfeminist They're so irrelevant, was anyone even thinking of them at all?

Hey @takeETSalert, driver of bus #4131, route 1, just left a man with a disability stranded at Jasper and 101st street.
This captures some of my feelings about Twitter lately: 
@Ramou I really owe you for mentioniong yogaglo in your post. What a great site!
Everyone always crowds the baggage claim in Edmonton. 
Sitting in the Montreal airport without ever having visited Montreal feels like such a waste.
So today could have started better.
I must have good luck, being selected for random screening every time. I ought to play the lottery.
There is a drive-thru line-up at Tim Horton's even before 5am.

Second best: sometimes it super is.
@FilmCritHULK Oh, but I'll never forget the first time I heard Seventeen Years.
@multikaren but your mouth will love it.
Worse than a 6am flight is knowing I'll be walking the 9 blocks to the shuttle in the rain.
@multikaren if I ever potluck with you I'll make my roasted red pepper hummus. Or roasted garlic w/ like, 5 bunches of garlic.
@whynotanna Pffft. It's only 6:00 here. I'm aiming for 8.
Now I'm getting anxious about catching the plane only 1.25 hours after the shuttle. But it's the earliest shuttle.
I have to get up at 3am to catch a shuttle at 4:45am to catch a plane at 6am.
@Ramou BTW, your post was the opposite of boring. Thanks for sharing.
@Ramou Totally. I'm trying to balance being okay not writing with this weekly thing, which I do want to do. I'll figure it out.
@jayasax being shitty, lol.
@teresatothemax @Ramou @iSmashFizzle I plan to do much writing from my room, though. So I'll be posting *something*.
@teresatothemax @Ramou @iSmashFizzle Okay, I lied. Nothing from me tonight. I still have to pack for a week away w/ a 6AM flight.
@Ramou @iSmashFizzle @teresatothemax Boring is okay. That's often how I feel.
@iSmashFizzle @Ramou @teresatothemax You won't get 5 Things, but you'll get something.
@teresatothemax @iSmashFizzle @Ramou Hah, first time I wrote in weeks was last Monday. :P
I'm flying to Ontario for a week-long training, so I picked up @emmastraub's The Vacationers for plane reading.
@mycolouredsky Good luck!
Want to see the lengths some people will go to to harass a woman online? 
@jennatar I don't even know what's going on anymore. Did someone make a new #gamergate graph?
@jennatar I hope he gets better soon.
CeeLo has upped the non-apology game.
@iSmashFizzle Nice work! I wish I had the income that allowed me to do that.
@farrah_khan Relevant for young boys too. Queer youth especially.
@juliacarriew HE WAS ALIVE AND MORTAL AND SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN DRIVING THAT CAR ITS ALL HIS FAULT
Yeah... am I the only one who sees Batman Jesus? 
Thanks to Marvel Unlimited I spent this long weekend reading like, a hundred comics. I echo @tanehisicoates: this is dangerous stuff.
@JessicaValenti FYI, the stats are 100% if said as "you females". New research just released.
Matters of the Flesh - I've been thinking lately about the online harassment of women. How can I not? This is… 
@iSmashFizzle @teresatothemax @Ramou Thanks for checking in. I need to get out of this funk.
@iSmashFizzle @teresatothemax @Ramou I've really isolated myself lately. Here, I promise I'll post something tomorrow. Not for you. For me.
@alexiskienlen That's probably because it's a garbage movie made for Garbage People.
/endrant
But nope. garbage.
I remember when everyone in high school would talk about how great Donnie Darko was. And they almost had me convinced.
DONNIE DARKO IS GARBAGE OKAY
Local theatre is playing Donnie Darko. UGH.
@geistmagazine @vivekshraya Featured in Geist! I think this means you've made it, Vivek.

@m_kopas !!! This is wonderful.
@saladinahmed cc @mountain_goats
Do read these comments 
@thefremen You're right, it's got a very familiar vibe.
Not that it would justify their terrible behaviour toward @femfreq, but damn, that bar is LOW.
I want to believe gamerbros are whining/issuing death threats for more than "@femfreq critiques a thing I like" but the evidence isn't there
@ScottMadin Word. These attempts to add nuance sometimes send the opposite message we intend.
@emmamwoolley Part of me can't believe how extreme the response of some of these dudes is.
@la_panique :-( That sounds bad. What's the issue?
I dislike mansplaining as much as the next person, but I'd like to declare a moratorium on "neckbeards" as an insult.
I don't much care about the Emmys, but I'm satisfied that Breaking bad cleaned up last night. All worthy winners.
I think I forgot deodorant today but I can just sit in isolation and listen to The New Pornograpghers so it's okay.
Ozymandias was the most hopeless episode of anything I've seen.
@TheLincoln @rgay In the forums, you can only look at one comment at a time. Like they haven't upgraded since the 90's.
@TheLincoln @rgay It really is. I'm so sorry to hear you have to use that. Good for headaches.
@iSmashFizzle If I could trade you my MONSTROUS cheekbones, I might.
@iSmashFizzle Self-love, Ashley! Self-LOVE.
I can't with these pro-Darren Wilson rallies. I feel the pressure build up in my head when I look at those photos.
@LailaLalami Is it all Beyonce's fault?
@DanicaHere @soupytoasterson Congrats, both of you!
@xtx33 Let me know how you get over this.
@pourmecoffee I think that goes for half the people in the theatre too?
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS EXISTED 
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay Does that photo alone make either of you cringe, too?
@rgay cc @annfriedman
Darren Wilson supporters responded: "Shoo…
@dcwarwick Only movies I've seen that outdo GotG's fun factor in recent memory: Lego Movie, Scott Pilgrim, Hot Fuzz. Avengers on par almost.
I don't often see movies twice anymore, but it's the most fun I've had at the theatre in a while.
Taking Em to see GotG today, because since I went with friends a couple weeks ago, I keep talking about it.
@multikaren @vivekshraya I can't stress how great it was to see you both last night. Hope the rest of the evening was fabulous.

Razor crapped out mid-haircut. Sent Em to buy a new one across the street. Pray for me.
@ntlk Maybe @m_kopas or @auntiepixelante?
@rgay cc @grammar_girl
@readandbreathe It's a slog at times. Don Gately kept me going.
Okay, this is really great. 
My (work) alter ego has joined, and Twitter has taken every opportunity to let me know that.
Now until September I'm taking on new violence prevention educators to speak to #yeg youth. Contact for more info. #yegvolunteer
@FarrenSquare Not interested in stopping you, just in having a conversation with you about it. :-)
@FarrenSquare I think we can both agree what is happening there is horrifying and police action is totally unjustified.
@FarrenSquare e.g. if state and police (and their supporters) view Ferguson as a warzone, they view their militarisation as justified.
@FarrenSquare I agree on that 100%. Just voicing hesitations in describing town as a warzone.
In hindsight, should not have tapped his shoulder. Dude's response indicated asshole, though.
White dude, legs splayed into aisle, blocking window seat, got angry w/ me when I tapped his shoulder and asked him to make rm for others.
@FarrenSquare I'm wary of that label being applied, literally or metaphorically. I'm worried this is how police actions are justified.
Until shit going down in Ferguson stops, my Twitter is basically RTs of that and cute stuff for relief.
@jbouie Exactly. 
@mensahdemary naps
@ScottMadin If you've never heard this story from The Moth, it's definitely worth a listen: 
So police are operating Ferguson like a dance-a-thon, except when you stop moving, your rights are violated.
Missed the "next page" on this link, #LRT. *Very* important read: 
@grammar_girl @mallelis @rgay I laughed a lot at this tweet: 
-Wilson didn't call in a shooting or call for an ambulance
-Brown's body lay in the…
-Darren Wilson approached Mike Brown for jaywalking
-Brown was unarmed
-Wilson shot…
The first four shots that hit Michael Brown were survivable. Last two that killed him came when he was bending over.
@iSmashFizzle @teresatothemax @Ramou Ugh. I've been neglecting this. I need to give myself a push.
If anyone needs to sit back and watch something nice and light this weekend, might I recommend Bill Cunningham New York? #selfcare
@nataliereed84 I always recommend Bill Cunningham New York. It's such a charming, nice doc.
@ScottMadin You've got some high hopes there, friend.
@grammar_girl I hope by the time it's 6:00pm in my time zone I'm doing some self care, too.
@BastardKeith What bonus do those of us who followed you for both get?
@fibulamytibia 
I can't even parse my thoughts on Ferguson anymore. The whole thing is maddening.
TW: Timeline includes photos of Mike Brown's body. Witness account of shooting via @ScottMadin: 
Uh, @globeandmail, ya might want to turn on the news.
It's still taking some adjustment to see cops that look like cops in Ferguson.
#OutrageHiatus 
(I did not see Snowpiercer Wednesday because I was too caught up in Twitter.)
I really need this weekend after this week. Snowpiercer and Boyhood finally in Edmonton, Em has work barbecue tomorrow. Good things.
@jennatar Hey, happy birthday! I hope it's been just as awesome as you are awesome on Twitter. The same level of awesome. Or more.
@Marty_Chan The bigger and more toppings you get, the more it helps them.
@JessicaKRoy When did we start extending this rule from fedoras?
@maureenjohnson @HarperPerennial Is this like, a Night Vale-goodbye?
@iSmashFizzle "Why would police officers have high-powered weapons? How would they have access to armoured vehicles?"
Sir... you are 36 years old and making a deal out of not being allowed to wear a colander on your head for a driver's license photo.
ATHEISTS UGH 
@prairiemonique Aw, I hope Bob is doing well.
@mallelis thinking of "possibly a fossil-man" still makes me lose it.
There was something about Rob's anti-feminism I found incredibly endearing, though he wasn't filling up *my* mentions.
#tbt the timeline that had me laughing uncontrollably last night of all nights: 
@fibulamytibia You might want to follow this list: 
@fibulamytibia Too much misinformation out there.
@fibulamytibia No problem. It was circulating yesterday. I'm only trusting photos/reports from journalists and locals on the ground.
@fibulamytibia That photo you just RTd is fake.
Not inaccurate to say riots are taking place in #Ferguson, as long as we're attributing that behaviour to police. 
@ScottMadin I usually find their involvement so frustrating.
After that speech, I'm reminded of @tanehisicoates's piece on Obama from two years ago: 
@Cavalorn Some days I feel that's ALL Twitter does.
@laurakeet @grammar_girl @stuckinspincycl Some reports said it'd been delayed to 12:30 EST, some 12:45.
Anonymous continuing to eff things up. Big surprise.
@nataliereed84 Sorry this happened though. :/
@nataliereed84 IMO, this is a gap in suicide intervention training. We need to explore options other than calling cops for marginalised ppl.
#OutrageHiatus 
Maybe you're still not interested. Why or why not? These are good questions to reflect upon.
Consider #Ferguson a litmus test for biases. When did you start paying attention? When #MikeBrown was murdered? When media were arrested?
@amaditalks It's nice to see you back on Twitter, for however long you decide to stay.
@sassycrass Heard this shouted in a video last night as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at civilians.
What does justice for #Ferguson even look like at this point? All I can hope for right now are no more harmed civilians.
Thank you @mallelis, @iSmashFizzle, and @rgay, for making me laugh on a night when I really needed to.
@iSmashFizzle @mallelis @Rod_McCallum @rgay @CBCRadioQ Oh, now you two are just being rude to Obi-Wan.
@iSmashFizzle But you do. Please take the time for self-care if that's what you need.
But I love a lot of you great people here on Twitter.
The love I feel for @rgay is strong.
@AudreysBooks Very nice!
@rrrubenstein This one just got back up, I think: 
@rrrubenstein Not live ATM, but hoping it'll return: 
@grammar_girl Oh damn. That sucks.
@mensahdemary @rgay I knew what that was gonna be before I clicked.
@AliKira @britl @OTOC_Laury My favourite is when people don't even come close. (e.g. "David" or "Darren")
@iSmashFizzle It's great news when we really needed some.
Oops, I accidentally ate a whole bag of chips.
Congrats @rgay!! So deserved.
@DrJaneChi @MoreAndAgain This is the same guy who, when interviewing Suey Park, interrupted her and called her opinion stupid.
@ScottMadin Keep in mind this is also coming from the guy who has cut off a WoC interview subject and called her opinion stupid.
@sarahljaffe self-hatred
@AliKira Huh. I didn't know that and lived there for a year. Makes sense upon reflection.
Sometimes I think to myself a considerate smoker would smoke half a block away from a bus stop. Or at least smoke downwind.
I think bad thoughts.
I get irrationally angry when I'm breathing in someone's cigarette smoke on a sidewalk, at a bus stop, etc.
#DestroyThoughtCatalog 
Friends and Em are busy, so I'm going to Snowpiercer at 7:00 alone. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome to.
@marisasano It bothers me so much. Like, I'm physically irritated by it.
#subtweet
I will never not side-eye you for writing "female(s)" where "women" works perfectly fine.
@la_panique 
@tylercoates Tiny Beautiful Things. If you haven't given it yet, always Tiny Beautiful Things.
Snowpiercer is finally playing in Edmonton tonight! I've been waiting to see this movie for weeks.
When you saw Do the Right Thing, did you care more about Sal's pizzeria than Radio Raheem's death? #Ferguson
@_Alexis_Marie (I've never done CF, but have heard a lot of concerns raised. Not advising you on what to do, just sharing.)
@_Alexis_Marie Not sure what your experience with CF is like, but thought I'd share this in case you're interested: 
I'm considering taking a half day off to go.
Has anyone gone to one of @EPLdotCA's book sales at the start of the first day? What's the selection like?
@multikaren Let me know when you're free and we'll make plans. I'm pretty flexible. Incidentally, I may be in Toronto for a few days in Sept
@multikaren YES. I'd love to do both.
@multikaren I think so! It'll be great to see you after so long.
@farrah_khan @multikaren I'm really looking forward to this.
Seriously, though, I'm looking forward to catching that Q interview with @rgay later.
I think @cbcradio is being a bad feminist. What's up with the women in this graphic?? 
@rgay Probably the most popular radio show here in Canada.
@BariLeia Also, poop. 
Adulting 
@rgay @Morton919 Roxane! I didn't even think about your leaving the UPS man. The last time you saw him, did you know it would be the last?
@yegmagpie I think it wants more than a nose.
This photo's gonna give me nightmares for weeks. 
Shorter Anon: We realised sharing people's private information is a shitty thing to do and might incite more violence.
Jesus. THANK YOU. 
@ScottMadin Nailed it.
Anon is like the person who means well, but whose actions speak to what an asshole he is. #LRT
There's a great passage about how overcoming any length of time is unbearable, but no single second is intolerable. So he bears the seconds.
When I think of great narratives abt overcoming impossible personal struggles, I think of Don Gately in last few 100 pgs of Infinite Jest.
Uhhh... 
@rgay New job: comment waders. Writers hire them to read article comments and pick out positive comments and good faith critiques.
Boy, do I ever not want to keep seeing that Robin Williams/Aladdin/Genie tweet.
One thing remains fairly clear to me: this is a cultural problem, and most of our focus should be directed at a culture that permits rape.
I really like that @scATX piece because it adds greater context to the situation, unsettles my own thoughts.
@scATX Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Steubenville. You've articulated the nuances and complexity of the situation well.
This is a must read re Steubenville: 
@libraryyeti @ScottMadin @SpringaldJack Thanks for sharing. Won't engage further. This is very complicated.
@nataliereed84 It sounds bad. I don't know what your circumstances are like, but I hope you can get out of that situation soon. :/

OH SORRY YOU COULDN'T JUST QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY HARASS ME AND GET ON …
@LadySnarksalot OMG HOW DID I MISS THAT COVER IMAGE
Now I want "Passions of a Misandrist", which would be half essays and half cookbook w/ recipes feat. male tears, blood, etc.
It was only a matter of time before someone anthologised mansplaining. 
@MissStaceyMay Full title: "Passions of a Man: Mansplainin"
Anyway, I'm still recruiting volunteer violence prevention educators to speak to youth in schools. @ me if interested in more info.
Final thought—maybe humanising sex offenders wouldn't be such a difficult task if we didn't fail targets of sexual assault as much as we do.
@pipingloud What I've learned, though, is I've always needed more than an app. I've needed a set of guiding principles to keep me on task.
@pipingloud Well what works for me won't work for everyone. This has been a years-long process for me. I hope you find something that works.
I have to believe that youth who make mistakes, or do terrible things to other people, can learn and change.
@pipingloud Now I manage everything with Trello. I researched how people use GTD with it and structured my use based on that knowledge.
@pipingloud There have been some posts on the internet that have really helped me. I implemented it with my email first.
And I mean the intricacies of consent here. It can be overwhelming when you're first navigating sexual relationships.
It saddens me when I'm teaching a class of senior high school students and realise some are learning about consent for the first time.
I say this as someone who speaks to youth about violence, incl. sexual assault. We fail so many youth by not teaching them this stuff.
Difficult to swallow, maybe, but important.
I understand people's distaste for this article, but I think what @amandahess says here is important. 
@pipingloud Getting Things Done. Google it and you'll find *plenty* of material. I was reluctant about it at first, but it's really helped.
@libraryyeti @ScottMadin @SpringaldJack While also acknowledging and not forgetting that sexually assaulting someone is a terrible thing.
@libraryyeti @ScottMadin @SpringaldJack Maybe I'm just out to lunch here, but is it not worth thinking about reforming sex offenders?
@ScottMadin From what I read, Buzzfeed Books puts out good stuff.
i feel like I ought to write about this, because I've made so much progress in the last month or so.
GTD has given me the framework. I use Trello to track *everything*. Coffitivity eases the burden of silence/loneliness. Music keeps me going
I'm so relieved to have found a method to managing my task management-related anxiety.
@RachelFersh None on my end. Might be targeted at women only?
@RachelFersh 
@RachelFersh Good Q. Haven't seen anyone say anything about limits per person, but that doesn't mean they're not in place.
@RachelFersh Replies and RTs, if I remember correctly.
#LRT An idea—Let's never shame anyone 4 drawing attention to rape threats, jokes, gifs, unwelcome comments abt rape, or rape-related trauma.
@la_panique Oh, but the texture of the bread combined with the lava-like Cheez-Whiz. Mmm.
@la_panique Grilled or plain? Grilled Cheez-Whiz sandwiches are such a nostalgic thing for me.
@ScottMadin Unless your whole perspective is out of touch with reality.
A reminder that #OutrageHiatus is a thing for people feeling all the feelings tonight.
@lisainpublic @KalenAnderson (I took one from my grandparents' farm and I'm not sure what to do with it.)
@lisainpublic @KalenAnderson Hey, what's that light green thing in the middle? A kind of squash?
@BariLeia #summer
Hoping more than anything tonight doesn't result in any more harm done. #Ferguson
I don't have enough tweets in me to address all my thoughts and feelings tonight. My heart is everywhere.
@m_kopas forgetfulness
Heads up, @timjacobwise: allies who mean well don't call critics "children" or "morons".
HOW DID I MISS THIS GIF 
Whoever beats 719 @TheToast applicants will have such an inflated ego they'll fail horribly anyway. Successful applicant will be 2nd-best
My guess is many people who considered applying have now abandoned hope.
Any wagers on how high that number gets before The Toast is closed to applications?
Am I ever glad to not be @mallelis right now, sorting through at least 720 job applications.
@rgay No bathroom shaming! This is the reason no one uses the washroom at friends' homes, just holds everything in uncomfortably.
Now waiting for the @ that is just "mock" in quotations.
Mock feminist threats are better than ever. Giggling at @Nicole_Cliffe's "yr name has been added to the list of Men Who Will Not Be Spared."
Of course, it's not a problem with the advice only. You'd have to be a huge asshole to do that kind of thing. #LRT
#LRT: What happens when you take the advice an MRA would give.
I remember that Mountain Goats tweet, too.
When I got to the part where @rgay mentions @mountain_goats in Bad Feminist, it was almost too awesome.
I kind of want a Bad Feminist t-shirt, but feel a man wearing one sends a much different message. 
@wagatwe That sounds like a great price. I'm sure you could upgrade later. Check with BB or AppleStore to see how much that would cost?
@wagatwe 4GB (I see that's across all MBAirs.) Looks like there's an option to double that.
@wagatwe If travel is your main consideration, I'd consider the MacBook Air a top contender. I believe you can get more RAM than I have.
@libraryyeti @evilfelicity I never use them, but I understand Twitter or Twitter apps have pretty good filters these days?
@libraryyeti @evilfelicity That does sound bad (like a network running spider week, in my case). So you basically avoid media for a week?
@DrJaneChi @wagatwe Afterthought: I only use mine for writing, browsing, and running small applications. Curious re capacity for large apps.
@DrJaneChi @wagatwe I love mine. Its lightness makes it easy to carry around. It's my fave to use, over my iMac and iPad.
@teresatothemax @iSmashFizzle @Ramou Good luck! I'll be sure to read it. It's nice to meet new writer folks on here.
@teresatothemax @iSmashFizzle @Ramou I have a couple of half-written posts. Hope to get something up this week.
@rgay Sounds fun. This is exactly how some of my nightmares go.
@iSmashFizzle @teresatothemax @Ramou This is beautiful, Ashley.
Silence is Not an Option - roxanegay: Another young black man has been gunned down. His name was Mike... 
Just watched a dude in a truck pulling a trailer cut off three lanes of traffic as he pulled out from a gas station.
Standing under a tree as rain pours down, hoping the bus comes before it's no longer dry here.
@nataliereed84 The scale is from Robert Downey Jr. to Mark Ruffalo, right?
See that #LRT from @Scarleteen for a real great resource on how to leave an abusive relationship.
@LauraTFrey Also highly recommended.
@LauraTFrey Let me help you with that... 
@rgay !! Glad everything is okay now.
@LouisatheLast whoops
@BariLeia That's a lot for a short period of time. (I also think I sounded a bit mansplainy in previous tweet. Sorry.)
Autocorrect "self-care" suggestions: self scare; self-catering; self I care
@BariLeia It doesn't *really* undo that work, but I know what you mean. Exam period makes it tough to maintain self-care.
@vivekshraya Great idea!
@mensahdemary In jest, I hope.
@ntlk If I get what you're saying now, I think I agree with the sentiment, the wording/framing just tripped me up.
@ntlk That's something that's reinforced here, too. It's noteworthy when people attack women's looks instead of critiquing the ideas.
@ntlk Does it, though? It was started by MRAs, right? I like to think they represent the values of a *very* small minority.
@grammar_girl 
Err... a year old.
Apparently that image is nearly two years old, but it's got to be one of the funniest things I've seen.
OMG that #LRT!
I can give more details once people contact me. I don't get into work details online.
ICYMI: I'm recruiting volunteer violence prevention educators to facilitate workshops in schools. Contact me if interested. #yeg
@nataliereed84 (Good luck!) :-)
@nataliereed84 The added gross or creepy risk could come from the person feeling trapped. But yeah, if ppl are respectful, we can avoid that
@nataliereed84 IMO, it's more risky than other contexts, but it can't be helped sometimes. Just be respectful and decent about it.
That's in major cities in Alberta, BTW. I just do Edmonton, but I have colleagues elsewhere I can put you in touch with.
If you or anyone else is interested in doing violence prevention work with junior &amp; senior high school students, let me know.
Speaking of which...
I start interviewing new volunteer violence prevention educators today. Love meeting people interested in this work.
The Scrabble essay in Bad Feminist is a lot of fun.
@CatG138 I'm impressed.
@CatG138 Wow!
@Terahj I've meant to read Butler for a long while now. Any suggestions for a good place to start?
@stygldpnyby Lissey is skeptical so far, but curious.
Snack time 
I've still got a season or two or Roseanne lying around, but I don't think I can bring myself to watch it. Cause, well...
I made that cat T-shirt tent for Lissey. 
@grammar_girl Awesome.
@rgay The staff at the local bookstore I frequent were all very interested in your book when I went to pick it up.
I've been waiting for this book since early this year.
Picked up a copy of Bad Feminist—finally!—and it's as good as everyone's saying.
@iSmashFizzle UGH.
OF COURSE some movies that pass the Bechdel test still don't value women sufficiently.
#LRT: Why place all this weight on the Bechdel test? It's neat to think about, but isn't particularly nuanced.
Review: Tropicana Trop50 w/ some pulp. Looks like (marketed as?) orange juice. Is not OJ. Fine print says "juice beverage with vitamins." C-
@MissStaceyMay Yes. Cringeworthy.
@libraryyeti I love that we tweeted about Scrabble but on two different things at the same time.
Scrabble needs new scoring system, researcher says: 
@whynotanna Here's the article I read: 
@whynotanna Glad you think so. We (and faculty) thought so too. :-)
@whynotanna I wasn't aware of it until recently, but apparently there's a related ongoing conversation re Andy Borowitz's pieces &amp; the NYer
@whynotanna Anyway, just a funny thing to share that your comment made me think of. There was a lot of debate about our campaign at the time
@whynotanna ...they never filed the paperwork and therefore we were never formally charged, despite being told so.)
@whynotanna (We were "charged" by campus security for "the distribution of malicious material." "Charged" in quotes b/c they later said...
@whynotanna Agreed. You might like this poster campaign some friends and I did several years back: 
@rgay Eff that. If this guy is talking about any photos I've seen recently, you look nothing if not fierce.
@emmamwoolley Dug this up for you: 
Is there any way I can sync Outlook to Gcal without gSyncit? My workplace is wary of any downloads.
@fibulamytibia It's pretty incredible. And it's an explanation that I subscribe to: 
@fibulamytibia Have you come across the theory about the finale? (The theory=you'd know what I mean if you have heard it.)
@FarrenSquare For your sake, I hope it does.
@rgay Phew, what's with all the ire directed your way lately? Like, it's all assumptions about your writing without having read it.

@rgay on being a Bad Feminist 

@leverus on How Not To Write Your First Novel …
@fibulamytibia Isn't is a great series? What did you think of the finale?
@fibulamytibia Where are you in the series?
@FarrenSquare Hi Farren. How's the Barney purge going?
The subject line also had an interesting take on my job title, but I don't identify where I work #onhere.
For some reason I'm very amused by this random spam 
I feel excited to go back to work after having the last week off. It's a great pleasure to love my job.
@mensahdemary Happy birthday! Sounds like it's off to a great start already. :-)
Threw out my post I was writing for today. Will start another one this evening.
@BastardKeith Apparently the airplane gets trapped "within a ring of erupting volcanoes". How do you propose they avoid that fight, mister?
@multikaren We can pretend, sometimes.
@multikaren A few months ago I danced until the club closed and I wasn't sure how that happened.
@mensahdemary @iSmashFizzle I didn't write last week b/c I was in another province visiting family, but working on something now. #youcare
@mensahdemary @iSmashFizzle This is lovely.
Finally watched The Cabin in the Woods tonight and boy was that right up my alley. What a fun movie.
@grammar_girl Thought for a sec you meant Netflix Can. as in Canada. :-(
This profile of @rgay makes for some excellent reading: 
@nataliereed84 smh
Also: tomorrow is August, and I've put Bad Feminist on hold at @AudreysBooks.
Of course, the book was only published two years ago, but the sentiment remains the same.
I picked up Tiny Beautiful Things today. Reading it, it feels like one of those books I ought to have read years and years ago.
@jaclynf You've done great work there. I hope this means a little more time to yourself. :-)
@CKdotbiz See: Rob Rhinehart?
Animals are lined up in pairs to board the Edmonton Queen riverboat.
NBD just on my way to deliver a workshop. 
.@Salon invents word "kindergartenders", everyone's favourite edible child. 
@kingdomofwench @FarrenSquare Unless we're talking semi-blasphemous, chunky guac, with lots of stuff added. Then it's basically a salad.
@kingdomofwench @FarrenSquare But like, eat it with some tortilla chips or something right?
@jesseberney @APBBlue "Word not found. Add to dictionary?"
@KrisLigman Thanks for the heads up. Being this far in and liking it, I'll likely continue with it until the end of S2 at least.
@KrisLigman Hah!
@KrisLigman Thanks for the guidance. :D
@KrisLigman I see what you mean by it being a bellwether episode.
@KrisLigman Watched Fromage. I'm sticking with the show. I'd decided on the episode before this one, though.
Peeta &gt; Pita &gt; PETA
@CatG138 You may!
Is there a movie feat. dead, zombified feminists come back from the grave to #killallmen? I'd watch that.
Re-imagining feminist icons as horror antagonists. Rosie the Ripper. Lady Mary Wallstoneheart. Gloria Stab'em. Have MRAs beat me to this?
Rape Investigation Finds Star College Quarterback Has Got The Goods: 
Rob Ford is murdered by a shark in Sharknado 2. What have we created?
@DanicaHere @soupytoasterson Sounds very scary. Glad you're both okay.
@soupytoasterson @DanicaHere Glad to hear that.
@soupytoasterson Shit, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you and @DanicaHere okay? Do you have the support you need?
@ZoeSTodd Your tweets have reminded me of this post by @rgay: 
@ScottMadin Right? It sounds kind of amazing.
Trailer for "50 Shades of Gray" is just me editing copy. cc @IsaacFitzgerald
Oh darn, cc @IsaacFitzgerald on that last tweet.
50 Shades of May is just me cutting back my SAD light intake and medication dosage and napping.
@IsaacFitzgerald Oh good, I was about to make this joke and I'm glad I checked your TL first.
@z_todd You are awesome.
@multikaren Basically the engineers sent an engineer to Earth (Space Jesus), humans killed him and pissed off the engineers.
@multikaren 
@KrisLigman Is there another way to watch the show?
@KrisLigman I'll give it a shot until then (and maybe beyond). I like how dark it is, but something isn't really doing it for me.
@KrisLigman Ah, that's what I meant I just didn't have the word for it. Bellwether! Now I have a word for it. Thanks for the help. :-)
@KrisLigman Not yet. That's eight and I'm on six. Will that episode make it all better?
@KrisLigman I remember you like Hannibal! I think? Does it get better? I'm about halfway through season 1.
After reading that Space Jesus theory I kind of want to watch Prometheus again.
Hannibal fans: how does the second season compare to the first? Because I find the first pretty dull.
@BariLeia Whoa. This place doesn't mess around.
@FarrenSquare But yes, I always wondered the same thing re: soldier.
@FarrenSquare Well, kind of. Just a version shared by my male peers in grade school.
At my job, we get a half day off with pay for K-Days. Using mine to volunteer with Em at Taste of Edmonton this afternoon.
@FarrenSquare I grew up with a very different version of that song.
Like, I'm pretty sure the biggest vibe killer is sexually assaulting someone because we're too embarrassed to ask for consent.
Tough thing to get everyone on board with in workshops? That asking someone for consent is not a "vibe killa".
Another eval comment: Q: What are your thoughts, feelings, or experiences about relationship violence? A: You're a super douche if you do it
Q: What will you do differently as a result of what you learned today? A: Ask for consent. 1 of my favourite things to see on student evals.
@marisasano @multikaren The opposite of earnestness is the potato salad Kickstarter.
@multikaren I am pro-earnestness.
@trello Figured it out: hotkeys stop working after moving a card to another board. Refreshing fixes it. #FYI
@trello Okay, they work when I refresh, but then stop working shortly after.
@trello Hey, hotkeys don't seem to be working this morning?
I feel like such a hack for really loving this weird system for productivity, but it's doing amazing things for me.
GTD really helps me manage that anxiety by keeping me from dwelling on the tasks at hand and just thinking about what next action to take.
So I've really been getting a lot out of Getting Things Done (GTD). I think it works for me because I have an anxious mind for tasks, etc.
A little bummed I'm not going to be eating delicious food in Toronto come September, but I'm told the food at training in Cornwall is great.
@JessicaKRoy Good to know. The tweeted excerpt got my attention, so I'll pick it up I think.
@JessicaKRoy thanks!
@JessicaKRoy What book is that?
@CromartyHeather Fingers crossed.
@emmamwoolley Yep, she's pretty cute.
@emmamwoolley My favorite of Lissey is this one: 
@rgay I can't believe it's almost August! I've been waiting for this for months.
@marilynk_ Mine has helped me understand exactly how much sleep I need, more or less.
@mensahdemary I really love reading your writing. Thanks for sharing this.
Fitbit tells me I was restless for an hour last night. :/
I was told I was going to Toronto in September, but apparently I'm going to Cornwall instead.
#LRT is pretty neat, even as someone who knows next to nothing about D&amp;D.
Can we talk about how the design of business books is truly awful?
I bought a productivity book in the business section of Coles. Whatever, IDGAF. 
@grammar_girl If you were to see it anywhere, that's certainly the genre I'd guess.
@grammar_girl (And one I'd never seen before.)
@grammar_girl Structurally, it's a great word.
It's like being in a cafe that plays only music I like.
Okay, I love Coffitivity. Not only does it simulate the noise of a cafe, but I can play my music on it at the same time.
This is great news. I already use Rainy Mood, but this might be even better.
I found an app/website that simulates the noise of a coffee shop: 
Still, a great example of the potential for redefining imagery.
It feels strange seeing Rosie the Riveter images now, knowing she originated as anti-union propaganda.
@iSmashFizzle Good luck!
Disappointment is learning @mountain_goats once played in Edmonton, in 2010, ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
@iSmashFizzle Thanks Ashley. You too, but much more than that.
It's a struggle for me to write regularly in public again. Thanks for the push, @iSmashFizzle and @mensahdemary.
@pipingloud Thanks Mary!
@iSmashFizzle I'm glad you wrote this, Ashley.
@emmamwoolley Thanks Emma!
Adulting - Emily and I got our engagement photos back this week. Here’s one of my favourites: I have... 
Though all are worth one viewing, IMO. Alien is still one of my all time favorite movies.
Anyway, Alien movies, ranked: Alien, Aliens, Prometheus, Resurrection, Alien 3.
I knew I'd seen it someone before, because the image of that nasty humanoid stayed with me.
Continued my foray into the Alien franchise tonight and finally watched Resurrection.
The credits almost make up for paying nearly $400/month in student loan payments.
Don't know why I put off my taxes. The result is always better than Christmas morning, thanks to thousands in tuition credits.
I'm got an appointment to finally file my taxes this morning.
@marilynk_ @pipingloud Thanks for the heads up!
@marilynk_ @pipingloud The graphic yes, but not the article! It'd be difficult to share in a classroom, but a great resource for training.
Well, the alien got young Tywin Lannister. #Alien3
No more Twitter though. Time for ice cream and Sigourney Weaver fighting aliens.
I remember spending so much time trying to find just the right search terms to avoid all the spammy BS. No more.
The internet is even better than it was a couple years ago. I can just google "stream x" and find the film on the first page of results.
@la_panique "god water"
@iSmashFizzle That's a great shirt.
@girlvanized May need to re-watch that. I really love Alien. That scene in the vents.
I think I'm gonna watch Alien 3 for the first time tonight.
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay I respect that 100%. Twitter will suffice. :-)
Ugh, that #LRT. I feel so heartbroken.
@la_panique P.S. Real glad to hear the good news. I can't imagine that kind of relief.
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay When are you in Calgary?
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay @NatalieZed You know, if she isn't off doing her thing in Montreal. :D
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay Hah! I'll be in your city from the 7th until the 11th, I think? I'd love to hang out with @NatalieZed, too.
@btx91 @ScottMadin Ah yeah, that's right.
@ScottMadin Is this the same thing women were excluded from participating in?
@la_panique @MissStaceyMay This is my announcement that I'm going to Toronto in September and would love to meet you wonderful people.
(Trick question: few things are Transformers-level bad.)
Is The Purge good enough to justify my curiosity in seeing both films? Or is it like, Transformers-level bad.
@iSmashFizzle That or have lots of $$ I think.
 
I'm going to Toronto in September! :D :D :D
@vivekshraya You've got me there.
Fixed it. MT @vivekshraya f̶r̶i̶d̶a̶y̶ meetings whyyyyy
@soupytoasterson smh
@girlvanized Totally. There's always that.
Every time I see @rgay has posted a new entry I get happy and excited.
@JacobRCarter16 @girlvanized Sure, but when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
I know they've got to do their thing, but I do wish they'd retire those images. (They won't.) Some people are harmed by that.
Aw hell. There are anti-choicers in Churchill Square with their usual graphic images and pamphlets.
@mensahdemary No one was around to judge, so I had three ice cream sandwiches. #NoRegrets
@girlvanized Got to agree. It makes me sad, too. I work with youth and have to hope everyone can learn and be more kind.
@mensahdemary I wish you find only the strongest coffee today.
@girlvanized Yes. On the one hand, he's a young guy figuring things out. But no excuse for the hostility.
I regret wasting time trying to reach out to @JacobRCarter16 last night. Little man is just trolling now.

Well, Not ALL of them.
@DissonanceDave !!! Terminator 2 was a staple for me in high school.
I tried.
@JacobRCarter16 I recommend taking a long break from Twitter, then. Sometimes that's the best thing we can do. Collect our thoughts.
@JacobRCarter16 I hope I'm of some help here. We all make mistakes, and I hope that we can always do better.
@JacobRCarter16 Only if you mean it. It could include taking down the video, but that's really up to you. 10/?
@JacobRCarter16 and learn from it. Finally, apologise, if you mean it. Don't tweet at iSmashFizzle, just put it in your feed. 9/?
@JacobRCarter16 and learn from it. You've made a mistake, yes, but I know you can do better than how you're doing now. Just admit it 8/?
@JacobRCarter16 is censoring you. People are upset with you and what you've said, and there's a difference. Third, reflect on this 7/?
@JacobRCarter16 much younger and making similar mistakes. First, like I said, stop tweeting at iSmashFizzle. Second: realise that no one
@JacobRCarter16 to come to terms with that–I've been there–but it's real crucial. So I have some advice, as someone who was once 5/?
@JacobRCarter16 with your reactions. And they have every right to be upset. You've caused some real damage. I know it can be hard 4/?
@JacobRCarter16 certain you grasp how big a mistake it was. A lot of people are upset with you for that, but you have made it worse 3/?
@JacobRCarter16 to your tweets. There's a lot going on here, but first up, you made a mistake. I know you've admitted that, but I'm not 2/?
@JacobRCarter16 Okay, but you need to be mindful before you tweet. You're causing harm at this point. I'm gonna say a bit then respond 1/?
@JacobRCarter16 Jacob, man, I'm gonna say a few things, but first you gotta stop mentioning @ iSmashFizzle. Like, this is crucial.
(This is happening, not an intro to a dystopian novel.)
Edmonton smells like the inside of a sauna, the sky is clouded with smoke, and ash fills the air.
@iSmashFizzle So glad to know you had people to count on.
@iSmashFizzle FWIW, you have my full support, but I know you have better folks you can count on. Keeping you in my thoughts.
@iSmashFizzle Shit Ashley. I'm really sorry that happened to you.
@zoewhittall Because it sounds like a fetish for cookware?
@ivortossell Depends on what you're looking for, but I haven't had a single bad experience with Wind, and pay half what I would otherwise.
@aeazel Points for honesty.
@mensahdemary Sending good thoughts your way, FWIW.
@marisasano Bunny hugs.
The ocean is dark and full of terrors. RT @ScottMadin the ocean is full of monsters, which is AWESOME 
@estolte Looks like a prime opportunity for many stubbed toes.
I feel slightly ridiculous for it, but I'm finding GTD immensely useful for my productivity. It just feels... cult-like.
#OutrageHiatus 
Treme is so good. I love these characters.
@jessicakluthe Thanks!
Friends: I just rescued this plant. Any idea what it is? 
Video: queen-bitchass: espressobean: Man with suit made of Mentos is dunked in a tank full of Diet Coke.... 
@britl This is neat. I rely on Wunderlist for most things, but this could be useful for projects that require additional detail.
@britl Thanks, I'll look into it. Funny, I was thinking "project" was a better word for what I was thinking of.
@britl Management of multiple goals seems a key thing here. Separate from tasks, but many tasks would make up the goals.
@britl I like that idea for big goals. I'm thinking a bit smaller-scale, and specifically for my job.
Friends: how to you track long-term goals and ideas in a way that makes it easy to follow up on them?
@michelledean OMG he is mansplaining "what about the men".
@iSmashFizzle Hahaha.
I'm eating a cupcake that has an Oreo BAKED INTO IT. cc @iSmashFizzle
@iSmashFizzle You don't give yourself nearly enough credit.
@phunphunphun @alexiskienlen Ah, gotcha. Hooters's self-consciousness has always been a interesting to me. (I.e. name is literally "boobs".)
@phunphunphun @alexiskienlen Nothing against women who do that, naturally. Just a bit creepy to have it as the dress code.
@phunphunphun @alexiskienlen So like Earls and a gajillion other places.
@libraryyeti Oof. Did you slowly transition off caffeine at least? Cutting it off outright is a terrible experience.
@grammar_girl Have you ever read this one? It's a classic, aside from the unnecessary misogynistic slur at the end: 
@grammar_girl Ah yes, agreed.
@phunphunphun @alexiskienlen What was the deal with Twisted Kilt? I know absolutely nothing about them.
@grammar_girl What is it now? Because the Montreal Gazette is calling Michael Bay the most important director today.
@MissStaceyMay @emilymkeeler Haha, darn.
@MissStaceyMay @emilymkeeler My bet is on "Entirely because of Law &amp; Order" for out.
@ScottMadin Sleep&gt;Exercise
cc @LiseGot MT @andizeisler Pitch pieces for the upcoming Law &amp; Order issue of @BitchMedia now! 
Kickstarter to fund My Dinner with Mallory starring @rgay, @mallelis.
Huh. A white supremacist was tweeting at me. Blocked and reported.
@mensahdemary @iSmashFizzle (The strangers thing is something I hope will change over time, too.)
@mensahdemary @iSmashFizzle Happy to be along for the ride with you two. You're basically strangers to me, I know, but you both inspire me.
Welp, I've written a (short) #NavelGazers post. cc @iSmashFizzle @mensahdemary
Weakness - There is this part of me that wants to be vulnerable. I turned 27 in June. As a child, I... 
@mensahdemary Looking forward to it.
@mensahdemary How's your #NavelGazers going?
Fitbit tells me I've walked 250 cumulative miles. #neato
@iSmashFizzle And vegan!
@ScottMadin Geek Culture: "Eff you Scott, I can do what I want!" *blows raspberry*
@mensahdemary @iSmashFizzle Cheering you both on.
@iSmashFizzle @mensahdemary Hahaha. Awesome.
@iSmashFizzle @mensahdemary ...when it comes to posting my writing.
@iSmashFizzle @mensahdemary I've been considering joining the effort, even informally. I have much apprehension I'd like to get over...
@iSmashFizzle @mensahdemary I hope he does, too! I've come to look forward to both of yours each week.
@CherylStrayed It's amazing, right?
@paigegorsak (Not saying I receive the same harassment, of course. But I notice that, too.)
@paigegorsak Whyte and Jasper on weekend nights are terrible. I've learned to stick to the bus when I can.

@emojidoll me
@soupytoasterson "Picture books."
@emojidoll *raises arm obnoxiously*
@la_panique That's good to hear, btw. I get down on myself easily when I feel I have no ideas for writing, or all my ideas are lousy.
@la_panique Yep, that'll do it.
@la_panique how? what is your secret? :|
@libraryyeti To be fair it might've been that whole cucumber I ate with it.
@libraryyeti oh please stop i ate too much hummus yesterday and it was the worst my stomach hated me
@rgay Thank you for writing it. Few novels have affected me the way yours did.
@sangwytch What kind of emails? B/c if it's from orgs or certain mailing lists they just need your consent. Likely I'm missing something tho
Checked @rgay's TL with my coffee this morning to see how that awkward flight went.
LOL: "Before a severe thunderstorm, unplug radios and televisions - listen for weather updates on your battery-powered radio."
@grammar_girl Right? She was the best.
Toronto, you get all the good people.
@rgay Awesome! It's a bit far from where I live, but would be a good excuse to visit a friend who lives there.
@rgay I do hope one day you'll be able to make it up to Canada.
@CatG138 hahaha
@jennatar I think it's neat.
@jennatar I don't know how the pizza thing started, only that everything sends their pizza stuff to you?
@rgay I'm loving mine. I find being able to quantify my activity helps with motivation.

I think it's because I'm hydrating enough for once? Usually am very dehydrated.
From where does one buy a handkerchief? This is a super sweaty summer for me.
"sex beast" should be a phrase we use more regularly, but never equate it with "rapist"
@ChiefElk If this were in a different context, it'd be a lot funnier.
no 
not here
*leads you into a dormant volcano*
i ʰᵃᵛᵉ ᵇᵒᵘʳᵍᵉᵒiˢ ᵛᵃlᵘᵉˢ
@DanicaHere @JoshYEG Err, this is pretty vile stuff to be saying about a person.
So the potato salad Kickstarter is over $38,000 now. Herein lies the cost of embracing irony without question.
@grammar_girl @amaditalks Aw. :-( I hope she's well.
@aeazel It's helped us see what happens when you combine The Matrix's Neo with Nolan's Batman, though.
I should get off Twitter and watch another episode of Treme.
@multikaren she is pretty great.
It's my favorite thing when she joins me on the couch. 
Bunnnnnyyyyyyy 
Their hatred of women (and their idea of feminists) is something though. Listening to it makes me feel ill.
Watched their videos on SlutWalk. They are just offline trolls, trying to overwhelm their targets. Their words have no substance.
I doubt they'll stay up long. Already didn't see any downtown today.
Checked out the Edmonton MRA website. (I like to see what they're up to.) Looks like they did another round of posters.
"sandwich cracker"
I feel more than a little ridiculous that I buy and eat what amounts to packaged crackers and peanut butter. 
@la_panique Ah, of course. I caught the drankin quote from him but not the chronical. I can imagine it tho.
@walrusmagazine Dance Break: 
@la_panique Also, "Chronical Dranken"?
@la_panique Maybe. Young crowd here, too. Teens, early 20s mostly if I had to guess.
It reminded me of the time I saw a Rocky Horror screening. The enthusiasm is overwhelming. And loud.
I had a lot of fun at the Night Vale show last night. Nerd audiences can be a little overenthusiastic though.
@la_panique That sounds delicious, BTW.
@la_panique I've been dipping a whole cucumber into my olive hummus all morning.
Digital first drafts are just such arduous work. I think my standards are much higher at a computer.
Been relying on my macbook for writing lately, but I just cranked out an easy page in my notebook. Time to switch, I think.
@rgay And then come out and say you don't know how Twitter works? That's some condescending BS.
@fibulamytibia dissolving people in bathtubs of acid and mopping them up?
@MissStaceyMay @velocipietonne @NYid07 I'm with you on this, though it isn't my place to decide. Men shld do the work, forget identity woes.
Everyone's watching Snowpiercer and I just want it to come to Edmonton.
@NatalieZed @la_panique 
@la_panique @NatalieZed Or normalised the behaviour and thus places no weight on it?
@NatalieZed It's weird, isn't it? Kid who used to punch, shove, threaten, etc. me did the same when I was on FB. Like... why??
Waiting for the Night Vale show to start. :D:D:D 
@mensahdemary I think it's a big leap to quit entirely. I remember it took me months of dissatisfaction before I finally left Facebook.
@mensahdemary I consider this sometimes. I've decided to take occasional breaks from Twitter. It brings a lot of good to my life to quit it.
Or, the modem's power cord.
My rabbit ate the internet.
@rgay @Annalisa_Quinn Really enjoyed that profile. Great work, both of you.
It's gonna be so much nicer being outside now.
I just need to do this one every couple years or so 
I think I will shave my head this morning. And then go hat shopping.
@adellewaldman on par with trolling. Just trying to get a reaction, I guess.
@mensahdemary I've always liked that line.
@yegmagpie Just casually shift the conversation to the show. :D
@yegmagpie I won't hate on people who like it. I'll hate on the book, though.
I love riding in the back of the bus on days like this. With all the windows open, nothing beats that breeze.
@lilytsui I'm not a woman expressing an unpopular opinion, so I think I'll be left alone.
So far, the best thing I can say about ASOIAF is a great TV series came out of it.
Just described A Game of Thrones as offensively boring, which I think I'll stick with.
@ColleenNatasha I found the writing to lack any depth and aside from some big moments it was offensively boring.
@marilynk_ I sometimes which I were a person who could hate a book so much I'd fling it across the room. AGoT was on my kindle unfortunately
@ScottMadin Esp. roasted. Mmmm.
@iSmashFizzle Totally.
@iSmashFizzle Yeah, it'd be worth giving another shot. Following folks like you and @rgay and @mensahdemary motivates me to write more.
@iSmashFizzle I've been in a couple before but we always lost momentum and feel apart after a while.
Thinking about shaving my head. Long-ish curly hair is a pain to maintain sometimes.
Riding a bus to deliver my third healthy relationships workshop to youth this week. Good week--volunteers usually do it.
@iSmashFizzle Are you in a writing group? Do you meet in person? Thinking I should join one, but all my writing friends are elsewhere.
I hateread A Game of Thrones and will likely do the same for the rest of the books: 
@xtx33 err, live-tweeted.
@xtx33 Couldn't get those images out of my head for a while.
@xtx33 FWIW the only time I sort of regretted following you was the time you liveblogged Human Centipede and I had to read the synopsis.
@xtx33 @rgay (or entertained)
@ScottMadin This is one of my favourite things: 
@isabelslone @NatalieZed @PizzaToday @kevinjn @badalie @sblackmcculloch Don't forget @CdnPizzaMag!
@MissStaceyMay I really enjoyed the time he wasn't in the news almost daily.
@CromartyHeather Bought Vauxhall, but I keep forgetting to update my iPod.
@mensahdemary That sounds like a very sad thing to witness.
@la_panique HEY PANIC
@ScottMadin (Heh, I remember now. I saw it for my 11th birthday.)
@ScottMadin Me too! And I've watched it since. It... doesn't hold up well.
@ScottMadin Have you seen Fight the Future? Or have you yet to experience it's glory?
@ScottMadin Ah, S5 has some great episodes. It's too bad the series really goes downhill from there, IMO.
@ScottMadin What season are you on now?
@mensahdemary Twitter does help with the loneliness though. Nice to connect with people we'd never meet otherwise.
@mensahdemary that is some superhuman-level helping.
@mallelis A Game of Thrones.
Kudos to @IsaacFitzgerald and co., because that's the best thing on Buzzfeed I've ever seen.
What Straight Boys’ “Favorite Books” Say About Them: 
@grammar_girl Also this: “Pissed when I ask him questions about it and/or avoids them entirely.” HAHAHA
@grammar_girl "fake deep" captures it for me. I will not pretend I understood everything after reading it. Missed some things entirely.
@grammar_girl lol. I liked Infinite Jest, but I understand the hate for it too.
@rgay maybe your next book can be called Bad Foodie.
@mensahdemary You've got to own a computer for two weeks minimum before you start spilling food over the keyboard.
@mensahdemary already?!
#lrt is very much worth reading.
@ntlk Sounds like I still have some time.
Waiting at bus stop. "Hello." Hello. "I just wanted to say repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand." Okay. "Okay."
@DanicaHere Me neither. I could really go either way if you don't find anything, but I'm pretty easygoing.
@marisasano DEADlines amirite
@CatG138 And who says time travel is impossible? Anything is possible with LANGUAGE! *shooting star crosses sky*
#insufferable
Structurally, I find this sentence fascinating: MT @cbcbooks Mordecai Richler passed away today in 2001.
@BariLeia You've got this in the bag.
@regentoforigin hooray!
@BariLeia That's like, what, a 5 out of 10?
@owlpelletz Okay, so I can rest my self-doubt. At least the mobile app is still totally reliable, in my experience.
@DanicaHere Sure, dinner sounds fun.
E.g. just now, it was telling me I needed to leave almost an hour earlier than necessary to get somewhere this morning.
Does anyone else find the web version of Google Maps to be inaccurate re: times since that last big update?
@rgay That sounds amazing. I haven't had real ramen since I lived in Japan years and years ago.
@DanicaHere @soupytoasterson Okay, just let me know. Hope you're both as excited (and curious) as I am.
@DanicaHere I'm on 118th and Jasper, right across from Famoso. But I can meet you where it's convenient for you.
@DanicaHere Sure do! I'm really looking forward to it. Is it still cool that I catch a ride with you?
@fibulamytibia Season 1 is... a little painful in retrospect. It only gets better, which is all I'll say.
@fibulamytibia Ooooh, enjoy it. It's one of the best series out there. In my top three for sure.
@fibulamytibia Are you watching for the first time? Where are you?
@whynotanna @ScottMadin In fairness I've only ever seen Secretary and Stargate. The latter years and years ago.
@whynotanna @ScottMadin *googles James Spader* *hangs head in shame*
@whynotanna @ScottMadin an ex-partner once had a genuine Spaderman, in his own packaging, name flashed across the cardboard.
@FatBodyPolitics I can't begin to imagine receiving harassment on that level.
@FatBodyPolitics Were all the comments directed at you, or others? Both?
@FatBodyPolitics !!!
I am sorry for your day which is turning out to be crappier than usual, Toronto.
@la_panique I am sorry this man (who needs support and care, obviously) is your mayor.
@la_panique Now he's saying he *did* use heroin? Ugh.
Paid writing job for queer writers of colour on pop culture, any location: 
@DarkHorseSwore I'm enjoying your blog posts. Well done.
@LouisatheLast smh.
@ArtThouBored That's okay, too. I don't create as much original content as I'd like.
I keep finding the Tumblrs of all these great people I follow on Twitter after way too long. Send your Tumblrs to me!
Em encouraged me to join her for swing lessons in a sweltering church, where I became That Guy Who Sweats On His Dance Partners
Damn those nachos are good though.
Em and I went to Julio's Barrio despite our reservations, best described as "drunk white dudes wearing sombreros."
@marilynk_ The fish tacos at the truck a couple spots over were amazing.
Disregard last tweet. Interpreted "writing" as "tweeting a little bit". Don't expect many tweets re: the conference.
Be sure to follow @AdamSerwer's TL today, as he tweets from a men's rights conference.
@multikaren Just the two! Unless you're counting the humans who live here too.
Isabelle (our guinea pig) is persistent in performing her mating dance for and trying to mount Lissey (our rabbit). Awkward...
@rgay Is this U.S. only?
I love the "rather unpopular" descriptor used for MILLIONS OF MIGRATING CATERPILLARS THAT CAUSE TRAFFIC HAZARDS.
@libraryyeti My partner is also not a great fan of moths.
For anyone with a phobia of caterpillars 
@la_panique @alexiskienlen I prefer to stick to one album to start with, see if I like it, let it go from there. Will try Vauxhall.
@MissStaceyMay It *is* a great headline, though. Among the best.
@MissStaceyMay I read it while eating breakfast this morning. My smile faded quickly.
@MissStaceyMay @la_panique @alexiskienlen @natsmith1 Okay Morissey fans, I've never listened. What album would you recommend I start with?
@MissStaceyMay Best headline, most tragic ending.
a Q: have MRAs discovered Gone Girl? Because I feel like that's a book they'd really get behind. lol.
I liked the way I wanted to keep reading, despite not really liking anyone. Except Margo. Boney maybe. But they're so peripheral.
I loved the way the book was crafted, the way the story was told.
I really enjoyed the book. I don't often read mystery or suspense. But I've been reading more widely lately, learning what I like.
I finished Gone Girl this morning and phew, what a ride that book was.
Poor Cupcake Bear just wanted to crash through the skylight and eat some cupcakes.
Cupcake Bear is the saddest story I've read today.
@rgay 100% deserved.
@grammar_girl @emilynussbaum I've finally picked up Gone Girl and am devouring it. Glad to hear her others are good reads, too.
@amirightfolks And if they had concerns about their messaging and not just how they're perceived, I bet they'd be right on that.
@rgay If it makes you feel better, dead plants hang around *much* longer at my place than the live ones.
@la_panique The price we sometimes pay for life.
It also proves the sorry folks who buy 7/11 sandwiches are a small minority.
this is neat: 
I'm glad @ManfeelsPark is a thing now. Between that and We Hunted the Mammoth/@DavidFutrelle , I think MRAs are covered.
Muted for the first time. It felt so good.
Really enjoying Gone Girl. Nick just gets worse and worse.
How do you avoid being That Guy pointing out that some lesbians use condoms? 
I get kind of excited writing rules for what messages go where, when I'm alerted, etc.
I've engineered the perfect Outlook email organisation system.
@jennatar That's a lifetime badge somewhere, right? Earn and drop $20k in the same day?
@amirightfolks Did you catch this story at We Hunted the Mammoth? Similarities to what you're saying. 
@michelledean wtf.
.@SaraLang I vote they hire @rgay.
@michelledean will pay to hack this dude's dating profile and just fill it with this.
@tracyvs There is, actually. More of a tie between desire to eat certain foods and forcing ourselves to work.
LOL: 
@deannakumpf That's awful. If you think someone might try to sell it, worth checking Kijiji and the like. Sorry that happened. :-(
@LadySnarksalot @CromartyHeather There's been sexist stuff posted there for a long time, IMO.
I feel like a wizard when I type in the PC code for an em dash.
@omar_aok congrats on Making It.
Thanks to a friend, I tried out @TheSequelCafe for the first time. Incredible food. Everything was top-notch down to the olives on the salad
@tyelland Happy birthday!!
@scATX You left out how kick-ass you are. Though that's maybe obvious for even new followers.
@beardedstoner Need an emergensteak bro?
I haven't cooked dinner yet but Em is baking cookies. I think I know how to solve this problem.
@NatalieZed You must have some outrageous (to me) stories.
@jennatar I am impressed. cc @CKdotbiz
@NatalieZed Hah, I do remember that! I think that's when I first started following you.
@Shakestweetz Haven't watched in a few weeks. Curious to catch up.
Turns out I've been doing music wrong. I hadn't listened to @dessadarling until today.
@owlpelletz @scATX @ScottMadin Of all the diverse species, races, etc., in space, women are still the most alien.
Wanna know something? I teach teenagers that you cannot consent if drunk or high. AND THEY GET IT.
MT @MissStaceyMay I don't have super fun drunk sex, wake up and want to report rape. I get raped &amp; want to (or don't want to) report a rape.
@MissStaceyMay YES. Can I RT this?
@MissStaceyMay Makes me hope they all have a much harder time having sex with anyone after publishing stuff like this.
@scATX Aw, get better little @scATX!
Sex has many risks. Allegations of sexual assault are not one of them, unless you decide to sexually assault someone.
Like this: "avoid sex with fellow students, period. It's just too risky nowadays."
Prompted by this article, via @CromartyHeather: 
All these men complaining about sexual assault prevention sound like rapists, more concerned with protecting perpetrators than targets.
@CromartyHeather This is really gross.
Plumber is now coming sometime today, not 9:00. At home supervising my monster sink.
@amirightfolks @ricochet_en "cool girl feminist" would be a great addition to a bio.
Plumber/hero arrives in 40 minutes.
My kitchen sink keeps erupting with sewage. Terrible morning or worst morning?
Not sure what to make of the Fargo finale. I expected more, but what we got seems suitable in its own way.
@mensahdemary me too.
Plumbing disasters are just the best kind of disasters.
Wish I could have made it to @alexiskienlen's book launch. Not only did I deliver a workshop, I returned home to a plumbing disaster.
@ntlk Sorry, I'm only good for melancholic and depressing music.
Getting It Right - roxanegay: It is so hard to get things right. I realize, of course that “right” is often... 
@MissStaceyMay He is always Nicky from The Wire to me.
@alexiskienlen Good luck at your book launch tonight! I'm unable to make it, but I'm sending you good vibes.
Wonder how popular @BitchMedia T-shirts are. Taken out of context, I imagine terrible scenarios wearing a shirt w/ "bitch" written in front.
@andizeisler Of course, it's also tied to whiteness and creative success.
@andizeisler And by this logic, how many people would be exempt from reprehensible behaviour?
@ntlk "I Am the One Who Talks"
@LadySnarksalot @NatalieZed lol. Unless it was intentional, "dead god" is one of the best typos I've seen.
@grammar_girl That's pretty awesome.
.@makeitYEG he's succeeding at putting his arm right in there, huh.
@ZoeSTodd My hometown. Worked for a year in that store.
@libraryyeti I'm happy to help you discover @rgay. Clever, incisive writing, and always a pleasure to read.
@emilymkeeler This is an excellent Tumblr.
@libraryyeti @rgay She has a special relationship with her UPS man: 
@libraryyeti When I first glanced at this tweet, I just assumed it was @rgay writing it.
That @RoyalAlberta's reason at this time appears to be due to @ThincDesign's close work with Indigenous communities is even worse.
.@RoyalAlberta severing the contract with @ThincDesign for no specified reason is a huge embarrassment to this city.
@parkersmuse I will always recommend Pontypool.
@Quiara I dropped in halfway through season 2 first time. I can't imagine how confusing the end of season 4 must be.
@Quiara It's a lot of fun reading these tweets.
@femmissgeek Probably the whole thing.
@iSmashFizzle @rgay envious.
My undergraduate accomplishment: landing (indirectly) in the controversy section of our president's Wiki: 
U of A President Samarasekera is retiring? Thanks for the good times had by the Samarasekera Response Team.
@ZoeSTodd *cough* @mariamdena *cough*
@rgay @iSmashFizzle This is exciting. What a great project this would be, with an incredible result, I think.
@rgay @iSmashFizzle I vote you two co-edit it.
I love you @blueplatediner, but you need a copy editor for your site: see "grilled grilled" and "garkic tomato saucewith".
@grammar_girl I had a hard time finding one that works for me, but I swear by this: 
Isabelle and Lissey enjoying their breakfast together this morning. 
"Larry is my favourite character on OITNB. He's why I watch the show." --No one ever
@sadydoyle Claudette is by far my fave. I don't think she's in season 2 though (haven't finished).
.@prairiemonique and I just checked out @colleenbrownmus at the Legislature grounds. Great way to spend a lunch hour.
@la_panique @mdgee Ah. Not sure I want to tune in to that. (Not for lack of caring, but desire not to be outraged.)
@la_panique @mdgee What was the program/topic?
I partly credit him for how I've grown, though I wish I didn't have to. He showed me how I didn't want to be.
Fun Father's Day fact: 2014 marks 10 years since I stopped speaking to my father.
Like, this carrot muffin I'm eating right now shouldn't exist. There's no explanation for how incredible it is.
.@DistrictCoffeeC's muffins are the best I've had. I'd do obscene things for a whole batch of these muffins.
@amirightfolks I just did. That's great news!
Oops, here's the link: 
Bit late to this, but this transcript of @amirightfolks's speech re: Bill C-13 and consent is a must-read. via @AnuradhaDugal
@amirightfolks I only now came across the transcript of your speech re: Bill C-13. Very incisive—thanks for posting that.
.@SerenataInE  made this chocolate peanut butter cake for my birthday. Last piece... :-( 
Ontario, you are saucy about voting.
David Sedaris is coming to Edmonton but no matter what I try, I can't find it in myself to give a damn about his writing.
IMO, though, it is the responsibility of allies to keep other allies in check, not of women or other marginalised people.
...but what if that trust were misplaced?
Of course, it was comfortable to never be faced with severe skepticism directed at my proclaimed allyship...
Only real forms of skepticism encountered were questions: "Why are you a feminist?" and "why did you choose Women's Studies?" specifically.
In my experience, claiming allyship is an easy way to gain trust. I remember being surprised I didn't face more skepticism early on.
That article is very much worth reading.
I Was Sexually Assaulted By Someone I Thought Was A Feminist And An Ally: 
@la_panique :-(
LRT: laughing and crying.
I once cared about whether it was right for me to apply label to myself or not. Used time &amp; energy that could've been spent doing the work.
Is "can men be feminists?" even a useful question? I prefer "can men put feminism to practice?" to which the answer is, I think, "yes."
@multikaren should have read "thing"
@multikaren "I just can't understand how people like this this I don't like!"
Damn, this week's Fargo was intense.
There were some excellent moments in the film. I just wish it were consistently great
Em and I caught Maleficent this afternoon. I really like the idea of it even as I dislike much of the execution.
@roymacIII Yes, I'm happy to spend my reading time elsewhere.
@roymacIII That's how it is in the film, too.
@scATX I remember sick days spent as a young boy with my mom with fondness.
The YA "debate" is the most worthless conversation to be having about literature. There are great reads in all genres!
