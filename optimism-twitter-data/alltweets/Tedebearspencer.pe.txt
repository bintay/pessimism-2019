I'm taking being lazy to a whole nuther level

Still hungover from last night, ugh. I had way too much fun <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Laying in sun with no lotion like poor person<TIRED FACE>

I'm in bed with ice cream so basically, just leave me alone, unless you want me to go down on you and your hot, and, uh, that's it
I'm sorry that I probably only love you if you are unattainable, I'm not lookin for mediocrity, life's to short <GRINNING FACE>
I'm like a puppy. Once I love you I will be faithful forever, unless you really fuck up, right Joan? Haha
I like a lot of girls that some people don't find attractive. I like what I like and make no excuses for it. The body has to be rockin tho <FACE THROWING A KISS>
girl sitting next to me has every inch of her body covered with tats. I'm not a huge fan of that, but her total commitment to it is so hot
I'm a bad man! "Muhammad Ali" and me, haha
I have been paid to talk to people all week, why in the fuck would I then want to go out and talk to people for free, no thanks!
I wish I had a girlfriend so I didn't feel compelled to go out and hang out with ladies with questionable morals
trying to stay home and be good tonight because tomorrow is gonna be so nice I don't wanna be too tired to go out and enjoy it, this sucks
me yelling in a British accent, WHAT A LOVELY DAY!
@MajesticBrotha you cray cray bro, haha
usually what keeps me awake at night is, no sex, twitter, and knowing there is ice cream in the fridge I'm not eating
I have ice cream in bed, so, ya I'm rich
@web_supergirl my explanation for everything is, I do what I do, haha
@Misswooowooo for real tho, me too, I was mentally exhausted after work today,haha
aaand, I'm in bed at 9pm, haha, This is my happy place
I always, always win at I can top your story. You don't think so? Try me. Tell me a story
You could pay a girl to text you and she still would not text you when you wanted her to, trust me, I know this
I never should have broke up with my last hooker
@misscharityanne someone is high af<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I've had a couple beers so like, idgaf
@in_cognico me too, I might be crazy but I have the best stories<CONFUSED FACE>
All you ladies are so appreciative of a fake gold cup but you don't seem to appreciate that I want to squeeze your 
I'm a little confused as to why "Whore Crush Wednesday" is so popular, seems a bit offensive :-/
my ex from 20 years ago texted me and says she's single now and wants to know if I wanna hook up,hahahahahahahaha, UH, NO!
Heart: Chill, I have to fall in love first.
Brain: *sigh - log on Twitter.
Yes I said I loved you, but I'm dead inside, so don't get all fuckin worked up about it
I like or love some of you for many different reasons, don't fucking question it
I am a stupid fucking hopeless romantic, I hate this about myself.
I haven't had a woman to love in 13 yrs and yet there is this small, very small part of me that still thinks I will meet "The One" hahahaha
My stomach is upset but not upset enough to not have a couple cold beers after work <CONFUSED FACE>
If you would have told me 20 yrs ago that I would go 13 yrs without a girlfriend I would say you're fuckin crazy, yet here I am with no love
The question on Jeopardy was about music from a ballet, none of the contestants knew it, I guessed Chikofsky and was right.haha, wtf
I don't mean to brag but I am killin it in Jeopardy tonight. I love when I know the answer and none of the contestants do<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@AngelaEhh my friend zone has lots of beer, and I'm enjoying one right now<GRINNING FACE><BEER MUG>

So many freaks in downtown Portland. It's just a freak show!
What a lovely day! 
Goin for a bike ride. Goodbye forever
the struggle to get out of my bed is real, more coffee, Stat!
Last nights bad tweets were brought to you by Hornitos tequila not coincidentally today's hangover is also by Hornitos tequila<TIRED FACE>
what I thought was my biggest achievement turned out to be my biggest failure, marriage is not the answer
just because I say I love you doesn't mean that I'm stupid enough to not know that you will disappoint me at any moment
Live life like everyday is your last because any day you could be under six feet of dirt and very few will even give a shit
if you have never heard of "Everything But the Girl" and they're Album Amplified Heart I don't wanna know you, take care
it's 1:30 am and I'm rocking out eating ice cream in bed, I'm such a fucking bad ass!
If you don't love this I don't think I like you.  WIZARD OF OZ - HOME - BREAKING BENJAMIN 
I don't hit fast food joints, I come home from a night of drinking and I cook, yeah, I know, I'm a freak
tonight I told a hot woman I could not hang out anymore because I wanted to go home an be a lazy piece of shit, but not in those exact words
I love losing followers, it's like my 100th favorite thing to do, fuck you muther fuckers!
When you are actually different than most men you are never getting laid because no women believe you, trust me I know
You people are seriously fucked up and your the only people I can relate to, how fucked up am I? Can anyone tell me? I need to know.
When one woman walks into the shit whole bar your at and changes your whole perspective on your night, THAT!

Leaving the bitterness behind as well
Why do people with rolls of fat wear skin tight clothing. It makes no sense to me. Wear loose fitting stuff quit making people barf
@kimberlypdx oh <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm a bargain. All you have to do is tell me you love me and I'm yours <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@kimberlypdx I haven't heard. What's happening?
The good news is that I'm never going to give up.
Having a shit ton of tattoos does not make you hot. There I said it, hate me if you want, idgaf
People who talk really loud when they're drunk are the worst.
@Kimgee8 yep, still waiting for that hello. I'm optimistic even tho it's been 13 years <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no, me on a dating site browsing.

Shits bout to get real!
@MsKitty101 <BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART>
washing clothes is a great excuse to get out of doing anything else and you can drink beer, win win
I'm so pumped for this Blazer game, I'm gonna lose it!
Um, where do we sell them?
I have a lot. 
Gonna be so rich..
I would tell you I loved you if I thought for a second you would love me back
left over pizza and loneliness for dinner tonight
I'm watching Changeling with Angelina Jolie, I'm riveted, such a good movie.
this coffee is my only reason for waking up
I'm not down for whatever
Blazers lose, I'm going to bed.
This Blazer game is pissing me off!
@PaulGAllen @trailblazers @ModaCenter We need this one bad! #GoBlazers
I like hanging out with you freaks on Saturday night and not going out in this town because I've seen it all here
I'm not easy but I am easy for the right woman. She just apparently does not exist
Waiting to cook my pizza is like extended foreplay, or prolonging an orgasm
Got my pizza, getting ready for this Blazer game. We have to win this one or we're done <CONFUSED FACE>
someone from work called me at 8:45am and now I can't go back to sleep. I'm still not getting out of bed though, got my coffee so I'm happy
yes, I am an old fashion gentleman but I know you've never met one so I don't expect you to understand
I liked some of your tweets but I'm just not in the mood to let you know I like them
yes I express feelings on here to get them out of my head, doesn't mean that's really how I am though
I'm so happy with nothing it's ridiculous, I appreciate the little things so much because I've had it all and I've had nothing
yes, I have a morbid sense of humor, I know you don't get it but I crack myself up
it's comforting to know that no one misses me so I won't feel bad at all when I die
I'm hiding in my happy place, my bed<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
I'm so bored I might get on this dating site and then hang myself shortly thereafter
I had almost 600 dollars taken out of my check in taxes. I am feeling homicidal right now! Must get beer!
my daughter is pissed off. I have never got 7 texts so fast in my life, haha
so tired of being on this journey called life all alone. where is my love? I wouldn't wish this loneliness on any of you.
I'm in such a bad mood I came straight home and went to my bedroom and am laying in bed
<BEAR FACE> needs pussy!

Waits forever
I got a cold beer, I don't really need anything else. I want a woman in my life i can cherish and spoil but that's just dreaming<CONFUSED FACE>
I've been single for 13yrs.People say I should get on a dating site. When I do it only scares me an reminds me why I'm single, I'm too picky
I really don't like people that much
I forgot why I'm here
I'm an inside sales guy but once in awhile my work asks me to go out and meet customers and I'm like, are you sure? You've met me right?<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
A woman so beautiful words do not do her justice and seem meaningless and all you can do is dream
@AngelaEhh L O fuckin L

Twitter owes me like...27 billion dollars...
@Kimgee8 my brain doesn't work at all when I think of you <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><BEATING HEART>
@Kimgee8 then it's definitely TL for me <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I can't even with this fuckin Blazer game right now!
@JustLittlePizza your obviously spam. Idk why you have any followers. I guess most people can't figure it out
Grabbing beer and rushing home to watch the Blazers. Boy do we need this one!
Life is like a box of chocolates, if chocolates totally sucked ass but they don't so fuck off Forrest
they said fake it till you make it, I've been faking it for 13 years, still haven't made it, anywhere
I got a message from a woman on a dating site. I got $1000.00 say's she's not remotely attractive.
I just want a girlfriend so I can buy her shit and squeeze her ass, I don't understand why this is so fucking difficult.
@Misswooowooo selfie time, haha. Sorry couldn't help myself<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I got a beer now so I might try to communicate with other humans via social media but I'll probably fail, whatever
Why is there always a soccer game on the TV at the Mexican restaurant
Going to the Mexican restaurant across the street for lunch makes me feel like a giant. I'm 6'6" so everyone barely comes up to my shoulder<CONFUSED FACE>
Tuesday, Monday's ugly sister
It's not you. It's me. I think you're ugly
reading tweets instead of sleeping like they're really important or something, uh, wtf
when a woman says she will sext you later but doesn't it is unforgivable, until she sexts you
This is my happy place where I stare out into thee abyss and dream of a woman who does not exist and… 
I can't even find a woman to take advantage of me at this point. What has the world come to<CONFUSED FACE>
@nwscuballc yes
Hi, I'm Ted E. Bear. I need a hug.
Good morning I still love you! Now if I can just find someone to love me that would be great <CONFUSED FACE>
I retreated to my bedroom at 8pm tonight, I don't care about the rest of the world anymore
@web_supergirl this is not a Zep song. The Guess who sings this. Wtf, haha
@nwscuballc I don't play games on my phone.
Oh I guess this nobody who is single handedly beating the Blazers is named Uhrih. What fuckin ever
Udrich! Udrich? Are you fucking kidding me?

Laying in the sun rocking out on great music. I'm in heaven<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

I followed you and you didn't follow me back.sorry to bother you, I didn't realize you're so fucking special, I will unfollow your highness
I got my coffee, you can talk to me now
This girl that said she likes me said she would text but she still hasn't. I hate when people don't do what they say they will<CONFUSED FACE>
Chillin at home on a Saturday night with pizza, hoops and a movie is the best!
hoops and coffee, no reason to get out of bed,haha
@MajesticBrotha I want to head south so bad, maybe we could trade places for awhile. I'm sure no one would notice, haha
@MajesticBrotha you a crazy mu fuka Cory. You should be at this club tonight wit me, we be killin the girls here right now<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I think this lady at this bar wants my attention but for her sake I'm gonna just ignore her <CONFUSED FACE>
@ericonederful it might be bad but I literally laughed out loud on that one
Was gonna stay home but going to the local dive bar sitting alone, playing on my phone sounds way better<UNAMUSED FACE>
I liked your tweet and I didn't even star it because I'm a brat. I don't even give a fuck
I'm not saying my kitchen was dirty but my daughter and I just spent almost 3 hours cleaning it, uh, I am definitely a bachalor<CONFUSED FACE>
@MelanieIglesias #ilovebigmamamel I can't lie, what can I say. Beautiful inside and out <BEATING HEART><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

If you guys saw the shit I text people you would die. I'm not normal <CONFUSED FACE>
I'm basically a fuckin super hero with no special girl to be super for, well except me mum and my daughter but whatevs, I mean super special
Let me tell you, if your trying to sell me something on twitter, it is Never going to happen. Unless it's vagina, that could happen<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I don't even need a woman because I've usually already had 3 orgasms by time I leave my house<CONFUSED FACE>
I don't tweet about vaginas anymore because I forgot what they taste like.<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Finally home from work, time for a beer and Blazers, woo hoo!
Comedic genius? I don't think Kevin Heart is even remotely funny
I was feeling like a big fat loser so I ate some ice cream, now I'm a happy fat loser
watching season 4 of Game of Thrones, is it always just violence and killing, because that gets old fast
I'm really good and liking people that don't give a fuck about me and dying alone <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm watching reruns of Game of Thrones, first time I've ever seen it. I have no idea what's going on, doesn't seem that great to me
all I've ever wanted is to love and be loved and yet it is the one thing that escapes me. no wonder I'm insane.
I often wonder what my life would be like had I married a good woman instead of the wrong one. So many wasted years<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
The story of Ray Floyd and his wife of 39 years almost had me in tears. Good thing I have no more tears to cry <CONFUSED FACE>
"The Masters: a tradition of being lazy unlike any other.
woke up too damn early, ugh, must get coffee!
Pizza and Blazers. Woo hoo! Perfect Saturday night<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@kimberlypdx love your new avi Kimberly <FLUSHED FACE>
@Mis_LaylaV oh hey boo, I wish you lived in my town, I bet we would be having a good ol time<FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm sorry but if your ass is not exceptional it is not gonna work out between us<CONFUSED FACE>
I like to go to a bar and just have a few beers, play on my phone and hope a woman tries to molest me, it rarely works out, but I have fun
I like to hang out at this place with a bunch of older cool dudes, a bunch of loser dudes and the hottest women in this shit whole town

"Dude"
"Dude?"
"DUUUU…
*cries a…
I feel like drinking some beer tonight, a lot of beer<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Sammy_Sega actually, as a matter of fact I do <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
It's difficult to get women to do what you want if you pay them cash up front, good luck trying to get them to do something any other way
I had toasted English muffins topped with melted cheese for dinner, because I'm a sophisticated bachelor, obviously<CONFUSED FACE>
Wow, haha, you are totally insane, and your hot. I think I love you.
Beer and Blazers! Let's go boy's!

When he calls you beautiful he means it.
fucking people ruin everything
I don't want this life anymore
Apparently I only want you if I can't have you<CONFUSED FACE>
You wanna know how crazy I am? I eat salad because I like it. Pretty fuckin crazy huh?
Wow. Wisconsin got fucked. That should have been they're ball
If I'm just guilty of loving too much, I can live with that<CONFUSED FACE>
Its true you can't buy love, because trust me, I've tried many many times<CONFUSED FACE> Good thing you can still buy sex though, wait what<UNAMUSED FACE>
The next best thing after Friday, Saturday and Sunday is when Monday day is over and I'm home with a cold beer. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

You might think sluts would take Easter off, but you would be wrong, smdh
@Ndeshi_M this girl showed me her baby the other day and I said, aww it's so hairy, how cute, You can take it away now,haha, not kidding

Just another day spent avoiding people, conversations, and church.
if you want to do something on Sunday besides lay around in your underwear and drink coffee we probably can't be lovers
unless your coffee or a hot girl, don't bother me, thanks
I wish I had someone to go get my pizza<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
this hangover means I had way too much fun last night, more coffee stat!
@MajesticBrotha your a freak bro, haha. Get that freak on. It's what makes life awesome. How you doin Cory?
I'm a bad man!
1 of my favorite girls wanted me to come see her. I am currently sitting in one on the biggest dive bars around, of course I'm right at home
I'm at a Mexican restaurant about to get a traditional Mexican meal. A breakfast burrito<PENSIVE FACE>
Good morning, I still love you because I don't have enough people to love, now love me back damn it! <BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART>
She wants revenge.
No, I am not gonna tweet this shit, you guys can't handle it<FACE THROWING A KISS>
I was being questioned as a potential juror in the same courtroom where I was once on trial. I have to say. I was not ok with it<PENSIVE FACE>
I have been single and alone so long I don't really see the point in talking to other people
Having lunch at Pioneer Place today. It's pretty busy. Hope no one talks to me.
I don't actually talk to people. I just smile awkwardly and walk on by. That's why I have no friends<CONFUSED FACE>
At jury duty and I have managed to not be called for 6 or 7 juries and the grand jury. This is crazy. So boring.
@Kimgee8 <FACE THROWING A KISS><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Kimgee8. Oh, you need someone to get in some trouble with<BEATING HEART> maybe Ted E<BEAR FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Day two of jury duty and I forgot my earphones again. I am just a complete fuck up!
Omg, every woman I text takes fucking forever to text back. I mean never mind now I'm doin something else now
Kinda nice being at the courthouse to be a juror instead of being on trial like I usually am, haha
On my way downtown for jury duty, so basically what I'm saying is, this would not be a bad time to die.
I have to go to jury duty tomorrow an get up a hour earlier then I usually do for work, so basically, fuck everything
my last gal pal and my new gal pal are the worst at texting back, ugh, why can't I have a gal pal that likes to text
I just got pizza so it's not to late to profess your love for me and get in on the action
Sexting is my new favorite thing to do, its so hot<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
more coffee! Stat!
I have the worst headache ever, ugh
I'm terminally single and I tell people that and they're like, you will meet someone one day and I'm like uh, no. I won't. I said terminal<NEUTRAL FACE>
@MischievousJam @DownFrontArtist I can totally relate to this. I too dreamed of the white picket fence, had it, and had to walk away<CONFUSED FACE>
Always too many retweets not enough tweets these days on my tl, takes a lot of surfing to see whats up wit me tweeps<CONFUSED FACE>
I can't ever get anyone to celebrate phat pussy Friday with me. Everyone I know is a loser
I'm sick of my responsibilities. I want to run away. Why do I always have to give and give? I never get. It's exhausting.

-me, reading my tweets
BEER
I would totally buy a girl shit if she pretended to love me, but no! I don't even know a woman smart enough to figure that out, so sad
ya I said it, I've had sex once in 3 years, that was the one time I met a single girl in this town that I actually wanted to have sex with
sometimes I wish I was gay. I know I would of had sex more than once in the last 3 years if I was
if your LGBT you should move to Oregon, it's got to be heaven cuz most people here are LGBT, I never see any single straight poeple
I swear, I have nothing against LGBT, I just wish I didn't live in LGBT capital of the world because I'm none of those
if your a descent looking, single, older guy, don't come to Oregon, you might never et laid again
The @trailblazers haven't got a favorable call from the refs since 1992
sometimes the @trailblazers play like they never played a fuckin game before, I just have to laugh sometimes so I don't cry
the only cute girls in Oregon are taken or strippers
I never ever meet a woman in real life that I would date so I guess I have to get me a webcam girlfriend, at this point I have no choice
Blazers and Beer makes for a perfect relaxing night. If only I didn't have to wash clothes I would be happy.I would pay someone to wash them
Good morning I still love you, unless your an asshole then your dead to me <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><BEATING HEART>
I had some good tweets to tweet but fuck it I'm goin to sleep. Tweet tweet muther fuckers

Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I won't be having sex tonight as usual, but I will be having cheese, lots and lots of cheese on my raviolis<CONFUSED FACE>
So there's that.
stayin in watching hoops and having a beer, I'm done wasting time with people that don't really care about me
I cared until you showed you didn't care and now I don't.
wow that was close, I almost followed someone that was happily married, I don't wanna  hear anything about that shit
I've lost track of how many women I've been in love with that disappeared never to be heard from again, and I swear I didn't even kill them
Something you want.
Something you need.
Something you know you probably…
don't feel bad that you don't love me, I'm used to loving people that don't love me. I'm kidding, you should feel terrible for not loving me
finally home from work, time for some Madness and a beer, woo hoo, yep I'm feeling better although none of you cared that I was sick :-(
Mike Rice just said Blazers are gonna have to score some points if they want to win this game. Man he's a fuckin genius
day two being sick, I basically feel like a piece of shit
my daughter finally got here with food and meds so I just might live, idk
my daughter is bringing me meds and food cuz I can't get out of bed, so thankful for her.
I can't believe how fast you can get sick and feel like shit, just the other day I thought I was looking good, today I look hideous, ugh

Karma has come back to fuck my ex hard. It's kinda sad though because it affects my daughter.
I just need someone to love.
Yes, I see you are scantily clad but I'm here for the beer. <CONFUSED FACE>
Hitting rock bottom is sending someone a message on a dating site and not getting a response. Good thing there's beer down here
I'm having a beer and watching Walking With Dinosaurs, so I can't be bothered now, unless it's for sex then that would be OK
Day light savings is ok at night and horrible in the morning. I kind of want to die right now <CONFUSED FACE>
watevs
@trailblazers rode my bike on the water front and I saw @NicholasBatum and his wife walk by.ha
This is still my favorite place to die alone <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
It's kinda nice out<CONFUSED FACE> 
I finally made it outside. It's like fucking summer out here. Crazy beautiful!
I thought everyday is women's day.

My life is fucked up 

That is all
I woke up and got my coffee, I feel so accomplished already today
Blazer game, pizza and twitter, that's all I wanna do tonight, haha
it's a beautiful day for a nap
oops, I had too many beers last night now I don't want to do anything
Never get tired of hanging out with my boys and having hot girls come up and hug me and not them.haha
I hang out with some of the hottest girls in this town and never have sex so I am not afraid to die
I don't even hit on women anymore because I don't want to be murdered in my sleep <CONFUSED FACE>
My phone and I are hanging out at this bar, if anyone wants to join me I'll buy <CONFUSED FACE>
@MissxBentley Congrats Miss B
Yes! we crushed Dallas, that was sweet
I don't trust people who say you can't have ice cream for dinner
In bed watching my @trailblazers is like the best thing ever
It's so cute how my girl friends at my favorite watering hole know I will by them a drink anytime if they need one <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> no matter whats up
Twitter is the best thing ever invented to help avoid people in real life. I need a beer stat
@Mis_LaylaV lonely without you<CONFUSED FACE>
@Mis_LaylaV miss you boo <CONFUSED FACE>
BATUM CHAKA LAKA!!!!!!!!
hahaha, it's not over till it's over
you've all disappointed me, so there's that whole thing
@DontTouchMyWine  aww yes, I can vaguely remember that feeling :-)
There's only one woman I want and I can't have her so I will die alone, the drinking too much has commenced.
Ya baby, game time. Lets go Blazers! Woo hoo! I need another beer, this should be good.
not trying to brag but I am killing it on Jeopardy tonight and of late
ok I've had a beer so I can read some tweets now
I can't believe I am looking at a dating site again, for fuck sake, when am I going to die already
I may not be getting laid these days but I don't think anyone else is either and at least I used to get laid, a lot
I feel bad for younger dudes these days, I mean there is a high probability that the girl they are dating is a webcam whore
I used to have to beat women off with a stick, now I can't find one woman I click with to save my ass. What in thee fuck!
how do you lose a woman you love, worship and give money to? Just ask me I can tell you several ways
the fastest way for me to lose a woman is to tell her I love her. So far it is 100% effective and it happens fairly quick
@OnlyFastEddie LOL, seriously!

I don't.
<MEDIUM WHITE CIRCLE>️ dead 
<RADIO BUTTON> social media addict

Carbs... not so much.
Seriously though, so many men have no concept of hygiene, I'm embarrassed for them
Most men I know are disgusting, smelly, and stupid so if women I meet assume I'm like them I understand why you wouldn't talk to me, I'm not

and I love it!
#SDS is, stop drop and selfie. It would be way better if it was #SDSC, stop drop and suck cock, just sayin
Shut your fucking face and get out of my way, I need a beer
Why don't you love me<CONFUSED FACE> 
This another pic from my walkabout on Saturday. I walked 45 minutes, to a bar 
Maybe she has athazagoraphobia 
I'm not bitter or heartbroken, I'm disappointed that you were like all the rest
amazing how a woman can leave you without a word said, like you never existed, gets me every time

Star: I have a girlfriend
imagine going 13 years and never ever meeting someone to love, this is hell
how do I live without you?
This is my daughter, she is my reason for everything<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
Waking up is always a bad idea.
missing someone, wondering if they're OK sucks
being awake early thinking about a woman is both good and bad, at least coffee is a sure thing :-\

ME: So I guess this is goodbye.
@KatieBurnett so jealous, looks heavenly, it's not that warm here :-)
my dreams came true again so I'm just gonna be home chillin with this pizza and a movie, ok good talk
That shouldn't even be a question
@LetoileSan oh, ya that's right. I always forget. Maybe stick with Vodka like I am right now :-)
@LetoileSan tequila<CONFUSED FACE>
Gettin turnt up and it ain't even 5pm. Haha 
Beautiful sunny day and I'm hanging out in a bar with my daughter,haha
It's like summer. I'm on a walkabout<GRINNING FACE> 
it's a beautiful day to fantasize about my dream girl and never actually have sex again as long as I live
I only have one woman on my mind and that is all I've ever wanted. It may not last but I will cherish her while I can
@PabstBlueRibbon  and @trailblazers  basketball is the best thing ever invented, woo hoo!
@Blazer_Gang I'm pumped for this game. We need this one I think.
I got a cold beer so I'm happy now, thank you Satan
My WCW blocked me, so there's that whole fuckin thing
all I know is I feel alive every second I think of her, just a thought of her makes my whole body want every bit of her

Count your blessing…
actually I got it so bad for this one girl I can't even think of another and I love that feeling
I guess I have to actually tweet to get a retweet , ugh, this is to much fucking work to not get laid

It's been done before.
@_LenaWithIt I was just saying the same thing, they need to cut they're loses, he's too injury prone
I've hardly tweeted at all lately because I gave up on love and don't have anything to cry about
A box is one serving right? 
I'm sorry I love you, I know it's stupid, I'll try not to do that anymore
This loneliness is killing me. I need to find someone to love before I die.
@meyta1cohen I think 10 if those views are me. I love that one <GRINNING FACE>

*Climbs back into bed.
I could really use a cuddle fuck right now
it's a beautiful day to lay in bed with my coffee
Pizza and movie night, in other words I'm staying home cuz I'm hungover from last night, haha
Must, get, pizza

I...well...hang on...hmmm.
oh sorry Westminster dog show is on, I have to go, bye
I am very likely to tell you a bunch of shit that if you repeat in public I will look like I have no idea what the fuck your saying

I'm having cheese nips for dinner, no, really, you can't make this shit up
it's so cute how no one likes my stuipid fucking tweets, haha, go figure, good thing that's not why I tweet :-)
@littleceezy hacked my twitter again. Your not supposed to be able to get into my phone but she can do it. She's sweet tho so it's ok <FACE THROWING A KISS>

I've been cleaning since I got home from work. Being a bachelor is so fucking glamorous
I haven't had a girl friend in 13 years. I'm thinking about getting serious about changing that, I'm just not sure why or if it's possible
I watched every bit of SNL40 until Kanye came on, I had to change it. He is horrible!
SNL40, I am dying right now, haha
Wow, Chevy Chase looks turrible
can't believe SNL40 is on the same time as the All Star game, ugh
I can't understand a word Anthony Davis just said, wtf
West is way better than the East. West Coast all the way baby!
why the fuck would you not knock if the bathroom door is closed, what the fuck is wrong with you? I need to take my mother for a long drive
my mother walked in on me using the bathroom! How's your day going?
doing stuff sounds ok, but taking a nap sounds even better
Valentines evening sunset I enjoyed all alone <GRINNING FACE> 
oh ya, happy fuckin stupid day!
Fell asleep earlier now I'm wide awake at 2am just like every Saturday night,  why
@Dame_Lillard he won that with ease. He didn't even do some of his best dunks, daaang
staying home cooking the best pizza ever and watching All Star Saturday night is my kinda Valentines day :-)
why do I bother!
My favorite pizza girl made me a special pizza, she's my Valentine <TWO HEARTS> 
I'm available to be someone's Valentine just to let you know <TWO HEARTS>
I took my special girl to the shop for Valentine's. She's getting a tune up then a wash <GRINNING FACE> 

Assholes can suck i…
Where's my boo tho <HEART WITH ARROW><DISAPPOINTED FACE><BEAR FACE>
I have put all my dreams on hold to take care of my mother and everyday it is killing me inside
if your not giving orgasms for Valentine's day, your probably a single loser like me
my mother has no one but me so I can't just say, You cough too much I'm out, I have to think of a good reason to go to my room,haha
I haven't had a Valentine in years but if I did, I would just want to go down on her Valentine's day, and, everyday
I can't even sit in my own living room. My mother coughs constantly, it is driving me insane. I will be in my room if you need me
Me: TEDDYBEARS
Cop: Aww.
@Just_Oh_Susanna I'm pretty gangster too, I think I owed them $11.00 when they went out of business, haha
I'm staying home on Friday night because I have to get up early, this is killing me already
for Valentine's  I will think of you when I masturbate
I just had to listen to my coworkers Valentine's day plans for him and his new bride and now I want to die.
No I don't have a Valentine and yes my love life is a tragedy, now fuck off!
I don't have a Valentine for like the 14th year in a row so I'm in a bad mood. Today is not a good day to fuck with me.
I can not even tweet the debauchery that is just my common everyday
Beer
Let's face it. Sometimes an inspirational quote is just what you need but usually it just makes me want to punch you
My bedroom is my favorite place to be <CONFUSED FACE>
My experiment sleeping on the other side of my bed has not achieved it's desired effect. I am still sleeping alone.
I bet my Tuesday night was hotter than your Valentines day
don't flatter yourself, I never really thought you were as special as I hoped you were
@lorigonzalez28 what's your secret, I could always use more reasons to smile
after work I just want a beer and to chill, and that's what I'm doin, life is good, Lonely, but good
@Mis_LaylaV haha,  Yes, if I can just learn how to do that, I have never done before :-) I know I will be home on Saturday, not going out,ha
@Mis_LaylaV you can be my Valentine boo since we don't have one <TWO HEARTS><BEATING HEART><GROWING HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART><HEART WITH ARROW>
blah blah blah
I'm hanging out wit one of my favorite girls ever, she so cute, love her @littleceezy  <BEAR FACE><BEATING HEART>
Work is just not the same without my special girl <GIRL> @bsimpson2337 <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
O M G WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME <BEAR FACE><PISTOL>
Good morning, I still love you because I have to love or hate creeps into my <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@emitoms me too :-)
I broke my neck when I was 15 and it hasn't bothered me much over the years but now every day it hurts so much I can barely take it
I had to move over to he left side of my bed that never gets used cuz my side was getting worn out,haha, I need a new mattress
@Mis_LaylaV their is a day for singles, It's every day except Valentines :-)
I'm done, with everything
When Paul, and Rihanaa got on stage with Kanye and sang a song called 4 or 5 seconds to WILDIN is the moment I lost all faith in mankind
@in_cognico omg, lol

Step 1. fall in love
My hearts like an open book for the whole world to see
        night thinking about someone 
            whos probably thinking 
               about…
Thank you twitter for making it possible for a total stranger to break my heart cuz all the heart break I've had in real life wasn't enough.
a guy redoes a 50 year old song that's been done by hundreds of people and wins Album of the year, haha, man, you can't make this shit up
what the Grammy's calls rock these days I call easy listening or garbage
Madonna looks good for being 90 though
Kanye with his voice digitally enhanced, I think he sucks, There I said it. not sorry, he's horrible
AC/DC rocking the Grammy's right now is making me smile. Back in Black was the first album I ever bought when I was 18
I hate James Harden so much I can barely watch a Portland Houston game
Every time I love someone I get hurt, every single time. I need to stop doing that.
this woman golfer's last name is Pancake, insert eat me jokes here
people that follow fake accounts really need to sharpen they're stalking skills
bad news, my twitter crush doesn't like me. Good news, I have a new opening for twitter crush, anyone? I'll just be over here dying alone
someone I love on twitter blocked me, unrequited love hurts but it's the only kind I know. Sorry I loved you unconditionally, my bad
Life is just stupid stuff that happens between orgasms
Being awake at 2am watching movies is stupid
in bed by 10 on Saturday night as usual
Saturday nights with pizza and the @trailblazers  game at home relaxing are the best!
I always have to go get the pizza. I wish just once someone would go get me pizza <CONFUSED FACE>
almost woke up too late to take a nap
In my steel toed work boots I'm 6' 7" so odds are if their is a disagreement,  I'm usually right <CONFUSED FACE>
Amy Lee's voice is the only thing that can bring me to tears anymore
when your drunk did you know tweets can go terribly wrong?
If a girl has garlic breath it is not gonna fucking happen
If I stay at this bar there is a high probability I will beat up a homeless crackhead. I seriously gotta go somewhere else, haha
I hang out in the same 2 dive bars and never ever meet any women which is fine, but when homeless crackheads start coming in it's time to go
I just went on an unfollowing spree. Accidenty unfollowed 5 to many. Damn it. I need to follow 5 people fast, my ocd is killin me
I have never had such a feeling, such a feeling of complete and utter love as I do with you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I like you a lot I just have no idea how to tell you without sounding like an idiot
I have so much experience with women I now have absolutely no idea what to say to one in person
people that aren't happy, Do you not have a bed? Have you heard of orgasms?
@heidi_rader <GRINNING FACE><BEATING HEART>
@MissxBentley she must not get up at 6am 5 days a week,haha
@MissxBentley that's almost bed time <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>haha
I was busy with real life. Did twitter end while I was gone?
I would love to make a huge concerted effort to let you know I love you and convince you that you should love me but I'm busy with this beer
If you don't love her with every beat of your heart and want to kneel at her feet everyday, maybe she's not the one 4 u or you aren't 4 her
I'm having one of my favorite bachelor 2 course meals, chip and dip
@OnlyFastEddie funny I was on your TL earlier then you retweeted me and my notifications blew up. Thanks man, much respect!
@McKnightyBoo lol, seriously!
Been there done that. I don't make the same mistakes 101 times, 100 was my limit.
@Lola_Dreambomb I've seen homeless guys with girl friends yet I'm single, wtf.haha <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
42000 followers and you follow 150. Without knowing anything else about you I dislike you intensely and will not follow
I'm not sure what I want but I know for damn sure what I don't want
I tried giving a fuck, it didn't work out.
She might just be a dream but dreaming of her makes me happy so I'm gonna dream away<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Every morning she's the first thought in my head, and every night the last. I just hope she's happy and I want to be the reason
I swear I'm done with 97.6% of the people on this planet, goodnight other 2.4%
I can't even believe some fucking people, never fails to amaze me the stupidity of some
@SoDamnTrue @LisaaRamos 10yrs this man has been walking to work, a kid an people help him raise money now you want to give god credit, wtf
@Dame_Lillard  just dunked on the guy with a 9'7" wingspan, Oh that was nasty!, woo hoo! @trailblazers
I don't have a girl friend but I have fritos scoops and cheese dip and I don't have to share, being single is not all bad

 #ReplaceALetterRuinATvShow
I love you so much you could be having free pizza for life but you don't love me back, I'm so confused
My idea of a good night is Blazers, beer and babes. I always settle for 2 out of 3, but that's still not that bad. I don't know any babes
My love life consists of my daughter, pizza, ice cream and beer
The #1 thing I always wonder is, will I ever again have a woman in my life that I can love with all my <HEAVY BLACK HEART> for 13 yrs now the answer is no
I've been beat up pretty bad by life but I'm not down and I will not stop fighting until I'm dead.
It is possible for someone you've never met to make you happy and want to be a better person. It's crazy I know <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
as usual awake when I should be sleeping because I slept when I should have been awake, ugh
I don't even know what the fuck that is!
Me about most shit nowadays.
@Moi_RaRa Yours are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen :-)
but in like.. a million years!!
<WINKING FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE>️

 
The friendship of Bernard King an Ernie Grunfeld is truly inspiring if more people saw theyre story their would be less rascism in the world

So good.  
pizza can make all your troubles go away
my life might be a shit show but at least I don't post it on facebook, my god that place is sad
when I get down I need to remind myself that my bills are paid and I got money in the bank, this wasn't always true.
sometimes I tweet shit to get it off my mind. I have to delete that sometimes because I am really not that negative and life ain't all bad
@Moi_RaRa I want to retweet this again, I'm having one of those days too, I'm sure tomorrow will be a better day :-)
This is so far from the life I imagined for myself growing up and working my ass off I don't even know what THIS is!
I bought new clothes and now I have more dirty clothes to wash, I didn't really think this through, kinda like my whole fucking life
twitter keeps unfollowing people on it's own. It is really pissing me off. I want to follow 666 people and I look up an 665, fuck u twitter
I stayed home from work today because I had business I wanted to take care of but now I just kinda feel like layin in bed an watching movies
aaand I'm in bed again, alone of course, but it's still wonderful
I'm from Oakland. I didn't care who won. I just wanted the money and since the score ended 28-24. I won $100  Yes! 
@SnoopDogg and I was in the other shark costume, me and Snoop homies dog
I'm about to go beast mode on this pizza 
If Seattle would not have scored in the last 31 seconds I would have won 50 dollars. That was bullshit haha <CONFUSED FACE>

You're supposed to be funny!

Not make us cry!!!
I stayed home to watch the SB with my mother, otherwise she would be all alone, I'm such a loser. No wonder I have no friends
Super bowl party? No thanks. I'm a mans man. I don't need to watch it with a bunch of people. I'm gonna stay home an watch it with my mommy.
it's almost time for me to get in beast mode and go get my pizza, chips and beer, woo hoo!
you don't have to prove to me your beautiful to strangers, I've got lovin eyes of my own and I wish you belonged to me
aaand, I'm in bed, haha
8pm on Saturday and I can't wait to go to bed <NEUTRAL FACE>
I'm so stuffed on Mexican food I feel like a burrito. I cant move
Weekend plans, Chinese on Friday, Mexican on Saturday and Italian on Sunday cuz it's all about good food <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
I would love to hear more about your day but I already have a nap scheduled, take care
I woke up so I can drink my coffee and plan my nap <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
laying in bed, I spilled ice cream all down my shirt, just got a new shirt and more ice cream, crises averted,
Seriously though, I try not to judge, Unless you ugly, then you need to get the fuck up out thiis mufucka,don't no one wanna see that shit
Godsmack on repeat laying in my bed with ice cream &gt;alone forever, heaven or hell?
One of my favorite things to do on Friday after work is to go to a huge dark bar and go sit in the corner alone an have a few <BEER MUG><BEER MUG><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
Middle of winter in the Pacific Northwest and it is 55 degrees and sunny. This is crazy.
I'm wearing new socks, new pants, new underwear and a new jacket. I feel sexy as fuck today <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
What's that you say? 
And that 
This 
I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day. Don't suppose it's worth the price I would pay 


Just don't get needy, please.
got my first fast food bacon cheese burger I've had in years, taken me a half hour to eat half of it, I don't see this happening again soon
I'm so far from normal, I don't even know what thats like
Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Yes, still love you. Good morning <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
When having sex for the first time in a long time is it acceptable for me to yell out "Release The Penis" right before the sex
Hot stripers with B.O is why I have trust issues
I just got my first hug of the week, it only cost me two dollars <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
She's the only one I want. There will be no settling.
I love *you and I miss *you so much, *my bed
I'm broken and no one wants me now, Watevs, I'm happy being alone, mostly <CONFUSED FACE>
I'm way too happy dreaming about a woman I can't have and never being in an actual relationship. I'm seriously fucked up <CONFUSED FACE>
So it's official. There will be no winter selfies. Haha. I hate being white. I'm meant to be dark brown
Went shopping with my daughter, found 2 pairs of jeans in 1 store that fit me, that is unbelievable since I'm 6'6 with a 33" waist. So happy
I'm going shopping with my daughter. We ways have so much fun <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@Moi_RaRa <BEATING HEART>hope you and your son are staying safe and warm <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I'm slacking on my New Years resolution, I still need to focus on getting in my bed earlier :-)

"Can anyone hear me?!"
Yes, I have the gift of discernment and I can look into your soul and see your true intentions and that's what I love or hate about you.<CONFUSED FACE>
Fake followers I can see right through you, just stop and go away <PENSIVE FACE>
I've found I NEED, next to nothing, want I WANT, is to worship you and love you for eternity.
Just a glimpse of your eyes can make a whole day more beautiful.
I just got through watching "Lucy" and now I'm thoroughly convinced I can access more of my brain than the average person. As I expected<CONFUSED FACE>
Finally watching Lucy, no time to tweet :-)
I can't find one woman on a dating site that I even like and yet on twitter that is NOT a dating site, I'm pretty sure I'm in love, haha,fml
I have decided I will only follow 666 people, because obviously, twitter is the devil.
I mean I have over 500 followers, most that are real and no one reads my tweets, why have a fake account, surely no one is reading that shit
I don't understand fake twitter accounts, they tweet a bunch of shit no one even reads, what is the point?
No time to tweet, gotta eat and back to work.ugh <BEAR FACE><PISTOL>
Goo morning, I still love you because my reality blows so I'm just gonna dream about you <BEATING HEART><BEAR FACE>
I'm surprised Miss Columbia didn't say her countries biggest contribution to the world is weed and cocaine
ice cream in bed is as close to having sex as I come anymore
thanks twitter for telling me who won Miss Universe before I've even watched it. Fuck you Twitter!
these women look ridiculous in these costumes on Miss Universe, wtf
2015, still have no one to love, I don't even know why I care anymore
I can't sign into my own wifi, fuck you comcast
I just flipped four eggs at once without breaking the yoke and I'm still single, this is ridiculous
I'm gonna take a nap just so I can dream of you
I would do something on Sunday if I could think of one thing better then laying in my bed with my coffee but it's winter, so, uh, no!
perfect Sunday, wake up, get coffee, go back to bed :-)
pizza and @trailblazers  is the best kind of Saturday night, we need a win, woo hoo!

You don't know real pain, you don't know loneliness. We could never relate, what's the point, you can't handle my crazy
I'm at my usual dive bar. Phil who I see every weekend just bought me a beer. He never remembers my name. It's hilarious
All my friends are married and I'm terminally single so no one will go have a beer with me, ever. So it looks like its just you tweeps an me
WIZARD OF OZ - HOME - BREAKING BENJAMIN: 
Oh shit! That dunk by @Dame_Lillard  was nasty! @trailblazers
But I could have told you <BEAR FACE> this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you, starry starry night
I would love to tell you all the reasons you should be mine, but I got this ice cold beer and now I can't remember
@AnnaBella_503 <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Having to take a late lunch fucks up my whole day, ugh
Good morning I still love you because apparently I'm needy as fuck and I want to love someone
I can't keep my hands off of *you

@VikingBlood70 @Redone68 I agree whole heartedly, Thee Best, Ever!

@Redone68
I was sick today and I still went to work and kicked ass! I don't even know who I am at this point
I went to Babies R Us and they didn't even have any babies. I'm pissed, I was really looking foward to hugging one of them little fuckers
I hate the fact that I want someone to love.
Sometimes I wish I was normal but I would not want to change all the things that make me who I am
I would tell her I love her everyday but I know I'm not worthy
I bring all the fixins and make my self a chef salad at work. This is so good idk why I ever eat anything else
It's lunchtime so I'm checking up on you freaks, I hope your all being naughty
I loved and I lost. The End!
I'm good at reaching out to people that couldn't care less about me. I need to just keep my hands to myself
Remember ladies, 40% of men over 40 have some sort of E.D. that leaves 60% that have a raging hard on and we know how to use it <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
Omg this girl tweeted how it's so great to interact with an online community. She has 10k followers and follows 100. Unfollow stat!

Every time I like a woman that seems single it turns out she has a boyfriend. I give up!
Just before I leave work I got an email that made me so mad I can't even drive right now. Need to calm down <KISSING FACE>
This is my new company vehicle. Why yes, I am the best forklift driver this side of the Mississippi <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
No! Your, desk is a disaster area <CONFUSED FACE> 
Good morning I still love you. I'm sick but I still went to work because I hate daytime TV and I'm a glutton for punishment<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@Moi_RaRa <BEATING HEART>
You scratch my back and I'll, go down on you<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
I can't even so don't even fuck with me
I'm looking for a worthy cause to get behind, but until then I am currently working on bring the word Groovy back
I'm getting sick, so I'm about to be so high on Nyquil I won't remember any of this shit.
Yes! @Dame_Lillard that was sick, that's my boy from my hometown, Oakland, woo hoo!
I'm feeling too good right now so I think I'll pay some bills to put things back in perspective.
I think I'm coming down with something. Look at this big glass of medicine I'm taking <CONFUSED FACE> 
I also told my daughter we have to hit the mall because I need some new clothes and I can't go to the mall alone, its a nightmare
I just had a heart to heart talk with my daughter and told her, her dad needs help decorating my house because frankly its embarrassing
To say my home needs a woman's touch is the understatement of the decade, more like a woman's wreaking ball and a rebuild <NEUTRAL FACE>
I spent $84.00 at the grocery store and only got one and half bags of groceries. I don't even know what a budget is. I get whatever I want<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
The problem with chasing your dreams is sometimes you catch them and then they turn into a nightmare <TIRED FACE>
I have decided to quit dreaming and start chasing my dreams, this probably won't go well but I'm gonna give it a shot <CONFUSED FACE>
Sometimes missing someone inspires me to make changes in my life. This is the case today!
Good morning, I still love you<HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I've heard all the bullshit before, still waiting for something different
Seattle better play a hell of a lot better than they did today if they want to beat NE in the SB
all I've ate for almost 2 days is 4 doughnuts. I am about to murder this giant pizza
YES! WOO HOO! WHAT A GAME!
I'm trying to go get a pizza between games so of course we are going into overtime,fuk
2 stops, come on!
15 points in 44 seconds, holy shit, but here comes Rodgers, fuk
WOW!
@MissxBentley you me and @Misswooowooo and a few other people tweeted that all at the same time, haha
UH OH! HOLY SHIT!
They're gonna be sleepless in Seattle tonight after that pick, holy shit Seattle just imploded, ugh
Sleepless in Seattle, more like hopeless in Seattle
I bet if I wanted GB to win then they would be losing, whoever I pick they lose, haha
wow, that was a pretty dirty hit by Mathews
Seattle your a fucking mess, get it together, please, your embarrassing us
that's a win for the hawks holding them to 3, Yes!

Who's with me?

The only reason I get out of bed on Sunday is to get coffee, then I get back in bed if it's winter
<BEAR FACE><BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART><BEATING HEART>@Moi_RaRa
Sitting home alone watching the Blazer game because I don't feel like going anywhere in this crappy weather. We better win this one<CONFUSED FACE>
I'm going back to sleep just so I can dream off her
why, why, why am I awake, ugh
So much beer so little time <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Yes, I have a life outside of twitter but my favorite girls in the world I only know by twitter <CONFUSED FACE>
When a girl that I like that has a boyfriend gets mad cuz I'm talkin to another girl that also has a boyfriend, I get so confused
Yes I am one of the nicest guys you will ever meet, but I am also 6'6,  210 lbs and a guy you do not want to fuck with <NEUTRAL FACE>
I just told this punk kid that he's half my age so any dispute there is a 90% chance I'm right, but he just don't get it. Dip shit.
Dude, don't try to be my friend if your a winy needy little bitch. You will end up gettin yo ass beat
I don't have an actual girlfriend but I have a few friends that are girls and they are too hot for words, they keep me from bein too lonely<CONFUSED FACE>
I swear, I tip so good sometimes my favorite bartender gives me back money, you would have to see it to believe it probably
So many women, but she is always on my mind. The dark hair beauty with the hypnotic eyes <GIRL>
Finally Friday at 5, yes! I need to see a guy about a beer. Stat! <BEER MUG><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
To much to do and no time to do it, ugh
Today is so busy and I had a old retired guy come in and talk to me for an hour, blew my whole day. Ugh
so basically if you, "like" like me, you're going to have to actually tell me, because I have no fucking clue anymore
I feel like my best twitter days are behind me, just like my whole fucking life, haha, ok, it's not funny,
dreaming of her is the only thing that makes me really happy, well, that, and beer
I let Jesus take the wheel and I wound up in a ditch, I'm driving from here on out.
the only difference between rescue dogs and regular dogs is rescue dogs drink too much
I won't watch, The Globes, The Emmys or the Oscars but I'm watching the World dog awards. I wish I had time to have the kinda of dog I want
Being a single man who takes care of my mother is just too much responsibility, if it wasn't for beer I'd be a total mess
I'm at the grocery store and this cute girl walks by, waves and smiles and says hi Ted, I have no idea who she is.uh wtf

~words

Not expecting a fucking thing from anybody. 

You're welcome.
Lunchtime twitter stalking. <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>

I'm gonna go this way and you should go fuck yourself.
My life story is a tragedy but I guarantee I have the best stories to tell <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>

I only wish that I could be the man that fills her heart with everything it longs for
It's only her, it's always been her
She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and I'm not talking about what you see with your eyes

I don't have a woman to buy presents for so I can get sex from her, what is the fuckin point of Christmas anymore
I kinda feel like crying in my beer because I am single during the holidays, again! but counting my money makes me feel better
another 12 hour day is a good reason to drink this ice cold beer, even when I'm relaxing I have to do stuff like clean and wash clothes, ugh

And once again we can say, It's a great day to be a @trailblazers and to admit @Dame_Lillard  is cold blooded as they come!
I bitch about not having a girl friend but to be honest, I'm a fuckin handful and I know it :-)  oops
@KMADrunner haha, wtf
It's time for #RipCity! @trailblazers and beer is as Portland as it gets. I'm all over that :-)
I find it difficult to find love because searching sounds exhausting and cold this time of year. I never did like playing hide and seek <CONFUSED FACE>
it's winter! I really don't want to leave my warm cozy house, ever
I really love a few ladies on twitter and I'm not ashamed to say it. It's perfect, as long as we don't meet so I can fuck it up :-)
I take care of myself, my mother, and I am always here for my daughters. That is enough to keep me happy but there's still something missing
..and my soul
"be kind to.. everyone" and "fuck YOU I OWE YOU NOTHING.. to everyone"
I dream of love and happiness but I settle for a cold beer every time. I'm still happy, no hugs just chugs
That awkward moment when I just want to like one of @Moi_RaRa 's pictures to let her know I was thinking of her but I already liked them all
Good morning, I still love you! Feel free to love me back. I promise I won't try no butt stuff, unless your into that <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I just cooked Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, dished it up and served it to me mum in her chair and yet I'm single,hahahahahaha
it's really hard facing the fact that I have been single so long I don't think I could ever be in a relationship again, I'm too defective
I still managed to win 5 bucks betting on my sorry team the @RAIDERS  I bet they would lose! but by 7 or less, haha, they suck but I win
just grocery shopping, washing clothes, washing dishes, cooking dinner, cleaning house and watching football, you know, guy things :-)
currently fighting the urge to get out of bed and do something
every team I picked to win in football today is losing except for one. Hit me up if you want expert picks, just pick the opposite of me
I will be working really hard today getting my pillows situated in the perfect position for optimum comfort
what I really love about you guys is I don't have to get out of my bed to hang out with you, you guys are awesome
@_LenaWithIt umm, I'm afraid my team the Raiders has that title,haha
it's freezing out. I will only be getting out of my big comfy bed for coffee
I got my <SLICE OF PIZZA> in the oven, ready to watch Blazer <BASKETBALL AND HOOP> woo hoo!
waking up too early on Saturday is stupid, thank Satan for this coffee
The only relationships I want are with my pillow and ice cream, well besides my daughter , of course
MORE ICE CREAM, STAT!
I never worry about how many followers I have because I know my real followers are gonna stay with me to the end, to see how I die
@heidi_rader aww, hope you get well soon beautiful <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Lupster17 what a loser! I would have touched it <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Good morning, I still love you! Show some love today or get to steppin, ain't nobody got time less
Reeses peanut butter cup ice cream has replaced sex, I'm not even mad
just spending time with my two loves, ice cream and my bed
I was ready to go to bed at 7:30, I really wish I was a bear so I could hibernate for winter
a woman on this dating site says she wants to meet me, I am trying to remember why I would want to do this
I'm 6'6 and mean looking with my beard. I feel like my mothers bodyguard when I take her places. Haha. I guess technically I am <CONFUSED FACE>
Taking me mum to the hospital for her doctor appointments makes me want to drink heavily
Ladies,if you see a man pushin an old woman around a hospital in a wheelchair an he doesn't work there.You should talk to him, he's a keeper
it was 90 degrees just over a month ago, tomorrow it's supposed to snow, this is my suicide note
I miss the old days when a woman would just tell me that she wanted me to fuck her, things are too complicated now
I think I have narrowed the women I love on twitter down to 3 or 4 or 12, I (accidentally) only told a couple though
I don't tweet as much as I used to because I feel like I said what I wanted to say, and I'm not one to beat a dead whore
I'm catchin up on my @Jenna_Marbles  video's so leave me the fuck alone, unless you wanna fuck, thanks
I only have eyes for you. This is a subtweet to my twitter crush, fyi <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm not antisocial, I just don't want to fucking talk to you.
There is nothing better after a long stressful day then an ice cold beer, some good music and people leaving me the fuck alone <BEER MUG><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I've been trying to go to the gym for months now but the bar is closer soo, thats a problem
I haven't shaved in a week and I have a full beard that is 90% white. I think it's safe to say I've given up on life for the winter
I might not ever have sex anymore but I can eat all the ice cream I want and anything else and never gain a pound, so it's all good
I'm in my bed with ice cream, in other words I'm both happy and miserable
I'm dying from lack of cuddling, it's science
@yourDOsomeday I watched the Flash while we were down 20,haha
I don't even care about sex. I'm looking for love and I won't settle for less. Until then I've got this <BEER MUG> to help me get by
@Tedebearspencer ONE, woman<FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I'm so defective and broken and yet I feel like it would just take woman to fix me. I could be wrong though, what do I know <CONFUSED FACE>
@Moi_RaRa I want to star this nine times, you are so cute, ugh, I can't take it <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><TWO HEARTS>
<BEAR FACE><TWO HEARTS><BEER MUG><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Good morning, I still love you because your all I got <CONFUSED FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I had a good tweet but forgot it so fuck it I'm going to sleep and hope I dream of sex since I'm never doing it for real again
,Wow, they just blew Alan Alda's head off on the Blacklist I love this show,haha
I loved, and as it turns out, I lost almost everything. I'm gonna hold on dearly to what I have left and be happy I didn't lose it all

*slowly distances self from group*
this craftsman commercial just said " with it's 12" shaft it can reach lots of tight places" That's what she said :-)
I can't lie, I got it bad for more than one or five women on twitter and don't know one single woman in real like I even like
Most the time my thoughts are just too much to put on twitter, that's kinda crazy when you consider what I do tweet
I swear, taking care of my mother is harder then it was taking care of my daughter and much more annoying cuz she doesn't have cute moments
JFC, I been at Burger king half the fuckin night just to get me mum some nuggets. Fml
I can dream about you
soo, I guess I'm watching Hercules
if it wasn't for the women of twitter I would give up on ever finding love again, but I'm barely hangin on
my mother wants to watch Hercules on demand and I want to watch the Blazer game,ugh, it's like having a kid
@Kimgee8 hint: it's me
I'm gonna think about doing something, right after I take this nap
props to Nascar for making a simple sport like driving around in circles so complicated no one knows who's winning, Dipshits!
damn it, I picked the Saints, my picks blow again this week. good thing I'm not betting a lot of money on this, I would be losing, ugh
dying of loneliness is not that bad if your in a big comfy bed and you have coffee and cable TV
What in Thee Fuck is going on with the Steelers, fuck,
waking up everyday alone is getting so old. I would like to wake up and snuggle with someone just once. I haven't in 13 years, fml
we're gonna make out aren't we?
me to my reeses
Doink! and Oregon still leads by 10 Woo Hoo! Yes!
If you want, I'll drive you crazy. I know a shortcut<CONFUSED FACE>
@Moi_RaRa <GRINNING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART><TWO HEARTS>
I ate so much pizza I can barely tweet, haha, but I can still read and favorite so I'm gonna live :-)
I'm goin for my 4th piece of pizza, it's getting serious now
I got my pizza that my favorite pizza girl made and duck football on my big screen, Saturday night don't get no better then this, woo hoo!
I'm late getting my Saturday night pizza and now I'm questioning all my life choices <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
<BEAR FACE><BROKEN HEART><SLEEPING FACE>
damn it, @trailblazers almost had that one. @Dame_Lillard needs to take over a little earlier next time and @nicolas88batum gotta do more
shit! Come on Blazers!
Blazer game being on at !2:30 gives me a great excuse to stay in bed and watch, woo hoo
@slamdancenance Nope! never :-)
wake up, get coffee, go back to bed, repeat
awake at 2am for no reason as usual
@Just_Oh_Susanna lol
my pillows never let me down, they're always here for me
I'm in bed already, haha, I'm in my happy place
If anyone needs me I will be taking a nap so you can forget it
I'm taking a staycation, that's where I take the whole day off and stay in bed with my coffee all day :-)
I went to my favorite bar and my favorite bartender wasn't working. I had to leave. I can't stand shitty service. <NEUTRAL FACE>
@heidi_rader I just have to say, you look fantastic <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@heidi_rader I think my daughter had the Senior attitude when she was a junior.haha <CONFUSED FACE>
Sometimes I get so sick of words. Words don't mean shit without actions <NEUTRAL FACE>
@Mis_LaylaV not here in Oregon, I think all the good ones swam far far away from here<CONFUSED FACE>
I am so happy just laying in my big bed, all alone. I don't even know me anymore
I'm participating in no shave November. It's been years since I've grown a beard. I will have a beard like Santa Clause by next week
I haven't had a girlfriend in yrs and I just hung this on my wall cuz I was born in Oakland and they're my team, fml 
Me: how does doughnuts sound for dinner?
Me: sounds wonderful!
I'm drinking because I just realized my twitter crush doesn't love me as much as I love her, or notice I'm alive
Good morning, whatever

I'm concerned. Things don't go well for very long.
oh your happy and in love, me too, I have ice cream
@caaataclysm instead of dividing them :-)
@caaataclysm I just wish they would quit being D's and R's and start being, People, For The People By The People and bring people together
Lets Go! Blazers! Woo Hoo!
I dropped my ballot off with about an hour to spare. Could not believe how many people were doing the same, it was awesome!
From now on I will only hangout with hot girls I have no chance with so I don't get my hopes up and get my feelings hurt
Good morning, I still love you, because once again, I have no one<NEUTRAL FACE>
@jimmykimmel this was hilarious, hahaha
I've calculated the number of times I would have to share my ice cream if I was in a relationship and determined it's just not worth it

* Easier said than done
Accepting that I'm never having sex again is gonna save me a ton of money <CONFUSED FACE>
Don't forget to vote tweeps, this one is important
Soo, I'm still on the market if anyone is looking for a well worn, slightly defective, older model <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Alone again, naturally
omg, @trailblazers with 3 turnovers to end the game and blow almost a sure win, just terrible
football, basketball and left over pizza, I'm in heaven
my rock bottom is laying in bed all day alone watching sports. I gotta be honest, it's not that bad
I think I'm gonna give up on dating for good and get me one of those lifelike dolls,haha
I tried dating again and failed miserably, I'm just meant to be alone forever I guess, what a waste
I tried to nap and couldn't sleep. Guess I have to watch my stupid Raiders lose another game, ugh
@stockejock @Sassafrantz uhh, those are titties, I'm confused :-)
@MelissaJoy33 I would rather die then do that :-)

Laugh at THEM because they're ALL the fucking same.
life long relationship? I can barely sit through a whole movie
You should know, if you come any closer I'm not letting you go! nope, still not crying

How does that work, exactly?
@caaataclysm I'm doing the exact same thing except along with my coffee I'm watching "No strings attached" so I feel even more like a loser
I'm literally the type of guy who would go on a blind date, meet a girl, like her, then tell her she could probably do better than me, wtf
@DebbiePuffen70 if you wasn't 2000 miles away I would give you a hug for saying that :-) you can have me if you want, no one else does,haha
I'm watching a romantic comedy, if the happy ending doesn't make me cry I'm officially dead inside and will seek help
@DebbiePuffen70 thanks, that's sweet but honestly, she could probably do better, haha
maybe I'm just in love with the idea of being in love. I know it never works out so I don't know why this part of my brain won't stfu
I am in way too good of a mood for having got rejected this weekend and being up this early, this coffee does wonders
I woke up at like 6,7 am, who really knows for sure. All I know is is way too early and my life is a joke and hate that I can't cry anymore
I got out of bed long enough to go grocery shopping and eat a ton of pizza, now I'm back in bed. Life is awesome
I got the best pizza and the Duck game is on. I'm winning at life even though I'm losing at love
Quack Quack! Muther fucker!
people who get up early on Saturday and use really loud tools out in they're yard, just know, I want to kill you!
Happy Halloween Hangover!
Best part about making a fool of myself on a first date is, at least I don't have to worry about going on another one <CONFUSED FACE>
@jeichner79 uhhh, no
I shouldn't of had that last drink and talked so much last night, ugh, I'm such an idiot, haha
I'm really good at making things awkward and embarrassing myself and having way too much fun doing it.
I need a filter for my mouth
went on my first date in yrs, pretty sure I had way too much fun and made a fool of myself and she won't ever want to see me again.haha oops
I have had 2 of the best days I've had in years, nothing could fuck up my vibe right now, time for some tunes.blasted
oh my, I am so glad that one fake ass follower stopped following me because I am really not looking to get more followers, see ya
@DebbiePuffen70 thanks! That's sweet<GRINNING FACE>
@DebbiePuffen70 easier said then done :-)
in bed, alone, again! this is so stupid
Yes! #RipCity baby!
I go to bed earlier and earlier as the week goes on, haha
It's time for #RipCity baby! Woo Hoo!!! Fuck stupid baseball
I quit going on internet dates because most my dates ended by me saying " get your paws off me you damn dirty ape"
I haven't had a girl friend in 13 years. I feel like a couple of you gals are really blowing it, but whatever
Beer and game 7 WHOO HOO!
WTF. Me every minute of the day <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
my new favorite thing on twitter is unfollwing someone I've followed for awhile that doesn't follow me when they do a crappy tweet, see ya!
@kjmeow you could always be my girl, I've been known to make women happy for almost 3 months :-)

"My what?"
life is either great or it sucks, it depends on if I have a cold beer or not
@Just_Oh_Susanna ugh, that made me realize I say that a lot too, that's probably not good is it? idk anymore
Guess what fake ass twitter accounts? I could not care less about your stupid pictures that make fun of people and say disgusting shit
my favorite people on twitter tweet real shit a lot and throw in some funny every once in awhile
@rockthechuck I wholeheartedly agree! holy shit, I just spelled wholeheartedly without spell check, I need a hug, fuck
I'm a lover and a fighter, I will fight for what I love
I might have a drinking problem. I'm beginning to think maybe I don't drink enough

tweet tweet I'm beat

Subtweet to myself.
@kimberlypdx to be honest, I don't either
@kimberlypdx  haha,I know right?I hate dating but I'm really tired of being alone and not having someone to do stuff with :-( dating is dumb
I'm on this dating site really hoping a woman from twitter saves me,haha what have I become
everyone I know says, Oh you should get out and date, your a great guy.  That's easier said then done
oh shit here I go writing women on a dating site, it's like being terminally single isn't bad enough. I want to be constantly rejected too
instead of ignoring these fake accounts I'm gonna start blocking them, so sick of them, they're ruining twitter
people need to do a little work and not follow these fake fuckin accounts, I need a beer,
so sick of these fake ass accounts that have a cute girl as an avi and all the tweets are just talking shit about people, fuck off, blocked
my bed is my happy place
#nw The Mechanic with Jason Statham, this movie is pretty intense
best pizza ever.My favorite pizza girl made it.I think she loves me. I know I love her. can't tell her tho,don't wanna screw up what we have
About to go get <SLICE OF PIZZA> I'm so excited <GRINNING FACE>
@Amrrwise that's incredible, you should get the medal of honor :-)
@Dame_Lillard our Raiders are killin me man, we gotta start lying sayin we're not from Oakland
I picked the Raiders to win today in my office pool, only my second incorrect pick so far this week, Fuck! why why why
fuck the @RAIDERS
I might be missing something, but there doesn't seem to be a future in being a slut
people falling in love, making big plans. I'm just over here looking forward to getting a big ass pizza tonight
I was so happy for my team for almost a whole second and then Bam! Fumble! I'm really starting to hate my @RAIDERS UGH!
I just said yeah baby just before my team fumbled it right to the other team,fuck fuck fuck
@TheCareBare I will only leave the house for <SLICE OF PIZZA> today <GRINNING FACE>
I just love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART><GRINNING FACE><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS><SLEEPING FACE>
Sex? haha, I'd be happy to have a fuckin pen pal at this point
watching my @RAIDERS is like watching a comedy, these guys are a joke. We went from "Just win baby" to, Just lose baby
@elizabeths_7 so true, haha
that new Southwest commercial where the girl is dancing alone all crazy is totally me, haha, omg I'm not kidding either
I'm now embarrassed to say I was born in Oakland, these Raiders are so painful to watch
I ended up having to clean my whole fucking kitchen, 20 minutes later my coffee was on and I was in a bad mood,haha
I thought I would throw on another pot of coffee real quick, was almost done but it blew steam and blew coffee everywhere,see next tweet
I can't date because I can't even clean off my bedside table, it's just too embarrassing
I'm no longer looking for  love<HEART WITH ARROW> I'm saving all my love<HEAVY BLACK HEART> for the only girl that deserves it, my daughter <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
It's a stay in bed all day type of day<CONFUSED FACE>
if you got a transvaginal mesh could please stay the fuck away from me
why, why am I still awake
I lost power so I couldn't get my usual pizza that I cook in the oven. I went and got chicken. By time i got home the power was back on<DISAPPOINTED FACE> <SLICE OF PIZZA>
I may have had a few too many <BEER MUG> last night. I'm just gonna drink this coffee and die, ok, bye <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Biggest reason I'm single is I never ever meet a woman I'm interested in, in real life, second reason is that, I'm a fuckin hand full
@Moi_RaRa I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to disagree with you. Some men have the capacity to love with everything they have<BROKEN HEART><GRINNING FACE>
I love my daughter more than anything! I love our text convo's. She's 24 and we still text each other all day every day
@heidi_rader I can't believe you have girls in high school. You look (I could use alot of flattering words here, but I'm goin with) hot!<GRINNING FACE>

I would be embarrassed by my actions if I gave a fuck or I was wrong, but I don't and I'm not
@Dame_Lillard @ConanOBrien fuck the east coast! West coast is the best coast, haha
If you ever thought I would settle, I think now you know, I won't!
I almost forget. Today makes 13 years since I had a girlfriend. That's 13 yrs having not even slept in a bed the whole night with a woman
I'm looking for real love. I'm not sure it still exists but I still remember how it makes me feel should I encounter it again
I wrote another paragraph to this woman on this dating site if she responds again with a sentence it probably won't work out between us
I haven't had sex in almost 3 yrs.I dont fear death anymore.You should probably not mess with me,
unless your a woman that wants to have sex
I worked all day and I just put new wipers on my jeep so I totally deserve this ice cold beer
@_ChicagoKidd don't hit her, your to cute for prison <GRINNING FACE>
If I write you a paragraph on a dating site and you send me a sentence. You ain't gonna get this man
the only thing good that has happened in my life in years is getting emoji's on my phone
if a woman likes my music I automatically think she's 10 times hotter than any other girl
@heidi_rader neither, I don't like spooky stuff. I think it might make me have nightmares.haha
<BEER MUG><BASEBALL><GRINNING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I don't watch a lot of baseball. Are professional baseball players always this shitty at what they do? cuz they suck,I've seen like 5 errors
sorry I'm in a bad mood, I'm so sick of bullshit! I will now get another beer and I will be fine, thanks
you should have to write some actual tweets of your own to be able to retweet other people, accounts that only retweet are bullshit
@emitoms I didn't strangle anyone :-)
your fake ass twitter account where you just say mean shit about people is so awesome, you should just kill yourself
This has got to be one of most fuked days I've had in years. Thank Satan for beer, baseball and twitter to take my mind off this shit<BASEBALL><BEER MUG>
Good morning! I still love you because I never learn from my mistakes<FACE THROWING A KISS>
oh shit I'm on the dating site again, I just never learn, probably gonna have bad dreams
just laying here in bed alone, wondering why the older I am the less I know about women, completely baffled currently
@ktmcburr I'm 6'6 so I find this hilarious<GRINNING FACE>
I'm bout to cook me some cheese with some raviolis in it
If your wondering if I love you, I probably do. I don't waste time with people I don't like <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Nothing like watching The World Series and having a cold beer to make it really feel like fall.
I'm at the hospital getting my mom's meds and one isn't ready so I have to wait. I'm missing the game. How long do old ladies live anyway
@caaataclysm I was born in Cali and I say totally all th time <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
I was gonna tweet but I'm too busy getting bent over by life
Oh great, now I have another twitter crush, ugh. I'm so sleepy<SLEEPING FACE> night tweeps <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Number two there's no number two you idiot.
I don't blame my parents or lack there of for the bad decisions I've made in my life. I just think I would be better off raised by wolves
I will love you and you don't even need to love me back, I really don't care anymore
The Blacklist is on, don't bug me unless it's for sex, then please bug me
I should probably quit @ing people since no one ever does it to me and quit talking to people in real life, same reason
I notice I never get disappointed when I just keep totally to myself and not interact with anyone
Good morning, I still love you because even though your a dream your all I have<TWO HEARTS><KISS MARK>
nothing makes sense anymore
@Lola_Dreambomb sorry, I think I've had that weekend before, except I lost a girl friend
I follow a lot of you just because you make me smile, lets not get it twisted
@caaataclysm I would but your too far away, remember :-)
I totally screwed up a tweet about not having sex in a long time, probably because I haven't had sex in forever
@caaataclysm I'm proud of myself because I went to the store today and did get ice cream :-)
And cursed with cowardly, worthless pieces of shit that do them harm..
