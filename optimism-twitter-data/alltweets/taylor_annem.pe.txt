@Dawson14bacon that's literally the worst.. I've had it happen to me at divisionals.
@Dawson14bacon I've gone under before <FLUSHED FACE> #awkward it was in a race too when I was like 8.
Kinda sorta wish there was a giant tornado that cancelled practice. Just kinda.
So we now have a pet bird and I'm not ok with it. I hate birds.
In the middle I feel like I'm dying but at the end I feel amazing. Literally the struggle is REAL. #swimmerhigh
One of my friends is being scouted for scholarships another just got his license and another who is gonna be a SENIOR. Where has time gone.
@Dawson14bacon I know how to do that! Swim is the best sport.
@Dawson14bacon cool!! I'm thinking about joining.
@Dawson14bacon are you on the summer league?
@Dawson14bacon I've done it all my life then "retired" and came back. I just HATE cold water <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> thanks for the encouragement!

That one summer when I went to camp, Colorado, Santa Fe and Seattle all in one summer. Yeah that was freaking amazing 
Truth is, I haven't brushed my hair, put on makeup, or gotten dressed and have spent the entire day on homework #ugh
