@percypippins somebodies comment as a joke or 'game' they play could be another's comment to make them go over the edge, words can do a lot

@percypippins so are taking it out on you, stay strong xx
@percypippins why shouldn't you deserve a tweet from an idol, forget about that stupid account they are obviously not happy themselves+

@glitchingoakley @tyleroakley wooooo so happy for you x
@PointlessBlog let alone go and wait outside and get upset when they don't come out of their HOME to meet you, especially as Alfie is ill
Still @PointlessBlog talked about it in a vlog

@PointlessBlog I am coming Alfie wooooo yeah x
@PointlessBlog YAY also I am meeting you at your kent book signing xx
@zalfieslayer I am guessing you are going with some friends then x
@zalfieslayer I hope so, I wish some of my close internet friends were going but none of them are x
@zalfieslayer i have no friends as in to youtubers as me x
@zalfieslayer ignore the first trying lol x
@zalfieslayer yes, i have been trying searching through people i follow trying to find people going to it as I am going alone aha x
@katie_cockburnx im going to kent so excited x
@zalfieslayer me! So excited <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@zalfieslayer are you going to the kent one? x
@cheerfuldeyes @PointlessBlog signing x
@katie_cockburnx neither, which one are you going to? x
@cheerfuldeyes OMG we are going to the same one!!! x
@katie_cockburnx @PointlessBlog same x
@suggsplanet OMG same I finally found somebody else! x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog trying to find one aha x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog no I don't think so but they can't come into the actual signing room just the queue x I hope I find somebody x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog Kent but I can't find anybody on twitter going to it x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog I'm not sure though, which signing are you going to? x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog if you are under 14 you do x
@suggsimply @PointlessBlog SAME, trying to find someone going to the same one as me so I won't be lonely x
@Saucysuggs i am 'stalking' fan accounts trying to see if anyone is going to the same one as me, so far unsuccessful x
Hopefully I will be next to a nice person in the queue at the #pointlessbook2 signing so I will not be lonely for hours x
@Saucysuggs @PointlessBlog so did I, I am so excited!!!
@queenxzoella I expect the signing will be in Bluewater x
Hey @queenxzoella follow me I need to DM you x
@queenxzoella did you see my tweet? x
@queenxzoella tell me when you see this because I am kinda letting out personal info x
@o2lftalfie I hope you can!
Still can't believe I am meeting @PointlessBlog x
Hoping that the person infront of me in the queue will be able to take a picture or me when I meet @PointlessBlog
I GOT A TICKET @PointlessBlog also I hope today went ok x
I GOT A TICKET FOR THE #pointlessbook2 TOUR OMG
Going through the TROYLER videos
Good times
Fed up of doing exams, can't wait till Easter holidays
Good luck @PointlessBlog also #pointlessbook2 is officially out today!!! X
@holydeyes I do this (about your previous tweet with the mistake and this one) all the time x
@TanyaBurr I always sleep in my onesie, I always sleep alone but considering my age sharing a bed isn't appealing, and I like my bed.A lot x
@JimsTweetings @TanyaBurr Even if you are drunk (naughty) the feels are still too much x
@JimsTweetings Did you get drunk Jim? x
@PointlessBlog Have fun! And don't worry about vlogging tomorrow, your excuse is pretty good aha x
Not a directioner but someone leaving a band is always sad #AlwaysInOurHeartsZaynMalik
@MarcusButler i always knew it x
ADGFJKLBDBSVAHKASDKP
So @Joe_Sugg replied to my comment on his latest vlog! Didn't freak out at all
@Joe_Sugg Can't believe you met @JessieJ !!! My idols together x
@Joe_Sugg I will come save you don't worry! Also if they ever do replace Zayn then I think you should replace him x
@OliWhiteTV YES PLEASE X
@tyleroakley wish I could go to your tour in London but getting there and going by myself and crowds isn't too appealing x
Everything on my timeline is about Zayn leaving 1D and I am just here like #RIPTopGear
@Joe_Sugg @JessieJ i love Jessie j and you x
@tumblroakley luckily i got home before I read it, cried in my room instead x
I feel so awake but it is still way too early!
@PointlessBlog can I just say that in the end of your vlog 'all tucked up in bed' you were looking pretty good, @ZozeeBo is very lucky x
A house where somebody lives is not the place to hang around waiting to see somebody, also there were mums??? Common sense? Privacy? x
In @PointlessBlog he vlog he was talking about people waiting outside the house: don't do it, it is HIS HOUSE, and mums don't do that x
@PointlessBlog stayed up to watch your vlog, once I am finished I will go to sleep so night x

(Idea by: @icesuggs &amp; @itschummydeyes) 
@Caspar_Lee @ZozeeBo is this your indirect way of saying I love you x
@TanyaBurr i spell it smokey, but a lot if words are spelt different x
@PointlessBlog i am having tea aha x
@tyleroakley k? k, maybe k will be our always
@joesperf Joe literally looks like a barbie doll in the second picture x
@holydeyes How did I know? x
@holydeyes yes definitely, I am guessing the writing in another language means you're my happiness x
@thatcherjxe ps: nice profile pic x
@thatcherjxe haha thanks, If only, though I do like to ship Narcus x
“@thatcherjxe: quote this with a selfie and I'll ship you with 1/5 of the yt boyband <KISS MARK>
( M B F )” 
Yeah that @PointlessBlog follow didn't happen, sad times x
Still waiting, and a follow is now very unrealistic @PointlessBlog I hope everyone who got followed is very happy x
Patiently waiting for a @PointlessBlog follow though feel like it is quite unlikely now,I'll just have to wait till the next follow spree x
The Zalfie feels are too much at the moment @PointlessBlog @ZozeeBo x
In 10 years I will be watching youtube videos @PointlessBlog my more serious response I commented but this is quite likely x
I commented liked and tweeted your video for you x @PointlessBlog
I even got a new follower but it wasn't you @PointlessBlog x
I keep getting notifications whilst I am waiting to see if I get a @PointlessBlog follow but it is never him x
Just waiting for that @PointlessBlog follow x
@PointlessBlog also I got a notification thought it could be you and it wasn't so now I am sad x
@PointlessBlog also commented a bit of a deep comment aswell for you to read x
@PointlessBlog already done it, liked and commented on the video x I put my snorkel on which was good, loved it a lot x
Liked and commented on your deep video @PointlessBlog xx 
@PointlessBlog already liked and commented, a follow would be amazing x
@PointlessBlog refreshing continuously x
@JimsTweetings and now you made me happy for favouriting that tweet,you've made me feel a whole spectrum of emotions today, still love you x
@tyleroakley Get Well Soon, I hope when you are better you can celebrate in true Tyler Oakley style, hope you had a wonderful day anyways x
@dreamsofzalfie thanks, I found it, and her tweets about it being a prank x
@dreamsofzalfie who got the 'DM' ? I can't find it anywhere x
@JimsTweetings Oi you made me cry from the title of your video! realised it wasn't true after I cried for 5 mins&amp;finally began to watch it x

@JimsTweetings @TanyaBurr you guys have been on a roll, Tanya replied to my tweet and Jim favourited my tweet.Thanks so much, so happy now x
@JimsTweetings though i did get worried by the title xx
“@JimsTweetings: •••NEW VIDEO••• My last video 
@Joe_Sugg And you got a bit cheeky now didn't you ey x
@Joe_Sugg just saying I tweeted about your video before you! x

ENJOY :D

@troyesivan @tyleroakley it is also 2 years since TROYLER met x
#darecaspar I dare you to follow me x
@TanyaBurr You looked absolutely beautiful, with and without makeup. If I can ever look as pretty as you it would be a dream come true x
@queenxzoella that would be telling x
#darecasper sing a song to Joe telling him that you love him x
#darecaspar hug the nearest thing to you and tell it how much you love it
#darecaspar lick the nearest thing to you
#darecaspar prank call Tanya saying you have feelings for Joe
@Caspar_Lee prank call Tanya (because she is gullible) and say you would call Zoe but it is about Joe and that you have feelings for him x
@Caspar_Lee I dare you to hug the nearest thing to you x
@Caspar_Lee I dare you to lick your toilet seat x
@JimsTweetings I cannot wait. Also if your wonderful fiance @TanyaBurr is with you can you thank her for the reply,it honestly made my day x

FOOD
@glitchingoakley sad times! why can't the time be the same everywhere? x
@glitchingoakley how do you know what time he is uploading? x
@AdelaineMorin is meeting loads of people and I am here on my laptop sad because I'm not one of those people x
@ViviannaMakeup I want it, I need to go shopping right now.
Youtubers are such enablers x
@ZozeeBo and @TanyaBurr uploading vlogs at the moment is making life a whole lot better x
@MarcusButler I can totally see the resemblance, all that undeniable charm x
Having a bath after dance exam using all the @ZozeeBo products I can x 
@niomismart do you know if people Core were inside? If so i hope they are ok x
@ZozeeBo so happy, your vlogs always make the day better and today was good so now I am over the moon xx <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@tyleroakley I AM READY, oooooooh any sneak peaks??? x
@PointlessBlog @ZozeeBo shouldn't Zoe be asleep? x
@OliWhiteTV the internet is a wonderful place x
Having one bathroom and 3 sisters is the most annoying thing, even if my pyjamas are in there they still go have a shower and I have to wait
@ZozeeBo slightly worried, you are usually asleep right now, are you ok? what is the gym doing to you? x
@ZozeeBo yeah inspiration for the gym is really working for you, hanging around on the gym floor, I can't talk, I am on my bed on youtube x
@JonathanJoly Professional Stalker
@JimsTweetings @TanyaBurr and why was I not invited Jim again? Don't worry I love you really x
Twitter Fangirling: AJHJFOVENJXKPOEK
@ZozeeBo watched your first and most recent video and it's strange how you seem so different yet completely the same, either way I'm proud x
@ZozeeBo most tweets in my timeline are about getting mentions from you and I'm just here like I am really bad at getting noticed x
@ZozeeBo I had an iffy day today today so I hope you had an amazing one, watching your latest video again to make it better x
@ZozeeBo Because all I dream is about youtube x
@JimsTweetings it is ok now because i have dancing but i had School which i kinda blanked so i can't remember much lol x
@ZozeeBo hope you have a good day, got a bad school day with the worst lessons x
been procrastinating a lot today but I don't really have anything to anyways I just felt like I did
@PointlessBlog I'm supposed to be all tucked up in bed but youtube is getting in the way, I'm getting close now x
@suggsplanet creme cup, i love it x
@DaddySugg yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
@Joe_Sugg @Caspar_Lee it isn't a JASPAR video without Caspar falling in some way off the bed x
@Joe_Sugg @Caspar_Lee the lighting in this video is just superb x
@ZozeeBo @DaddySugg father daughter relationship goals x
Still buzzing from the fact that @ZozeeBo has my letter even if it is one in millions, I hope she knows how much she has done for me x
the day when I get tweeted by @ZozeeBo (note the optimism) will be the best day of my life! (the optimism is too much, urgh) xx
@ZozeeBo When you said thank you it reminded me of your acceptance speech at the teen choice awards, LOL x
@ZozeeBo when I see your videos now compared to your first videos and how far you have come and how happy you are, I always start to cry x
@ZozeeBo @boohoo BEACH HUTS I SEE BEACH HUTS!
@ZozeeBo you are my style inspiration and just life inspiration, already watched your video and it made me smile so much, love you x
@TanyaBurr watching you and you are doing really well x 
@TanyaBurr watching you x 
although sunday is homework day it is also my fave day as @ZozeeBo @PointlessBlog @Joe_Sugg @JimsTweetings @TanyaBurr upload and lots more x
@ZozeeBo 2 VIDEOS I REPEAT 2 VIDEOS THIS IS NOT A DRILL
Reminded me of one of @PointlessBlog vlogs where they were in the lift doing this x
@JoeSuggIsMyLife I realised this might/will happen one day, now I am even more distraught! URGH THE PAIN
@JoeSuggIsMyLife just sat in shock then went frantic and checked youtube and all their channels until I knew it wasn't true, still in pain x

@JimsTweetings you should go on Got To Dance! x
@JimsTweetings You were a dancing King young and sweet only 27!
@JimsTweetings I am sure you were fabulous, what with being so 'edgy' and cool!
@queenxzoella focus on that rather than everything else, don't let worrying or sadness spoil the good things x
@SprinkleofGlitr @JustMattWatson Darcy is such a beautiful girl, just like her mummy x
@SprinkleofGlitr @JustMattWatson the joys of travelling, goodluck x
@queenxzoella and remember all that is important, like meeting @donutdeyes x
@queenxzoella whatever seems wrong now, isn't worth giving up in life over. Just relax for a bit and forget whatever is the problem... x
@queenxzoella please don't x
@MarcusButler just saying but you look like you are doing a poo in this! Did you? x
It is a sunday which means most people are uploading videos, watched all of @ZozeeBo videos yesterday so can't wait for a new one xx
@ZozeeBo can you wish me good luck for my dance exam today, it would make my day! love you xx
@MarcusButler you betta because then you might just someday see my 'sexy face' on my twitter and wouldn't that be fabulous x
@donutdeyes YES!
Zalfie car journeys look like so much more fun than mine, just me sitting listening to music, imagining meeting youtubers, @PointlessBlog
@PointlessBlog What you guys letting go of? POOs comes to my head, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!
@ZozeeBo @PointlessBlog FROZEN IS MY BAE, YOU NEED TO DO A COLLAB WHERE YOU SING SONGS TOGETHER PLEASE! x
@PointlessBlog @ZozeeBo When is the single coming out? x
@JimsTweetings what about being a gentleman, you can't be edgy and a gentleman! Or you can be different everyday like a superman! x

@ZozeeBo @PointlessBlog @AnnaSaccone @JonathanJoly please change it to this, it would be super duper funny x
@PointlessBlog @AnnaSaccone sure why not, I might get noticed x
@queenxzoella you do not understand how jealous I am of all your notices, but I love your account and you deserve them x
@PointlessBlog I would but I am in bed myself, on youtube and I really can't be bothered to come all the way to Brighton right now x
"I've fallen and can't get up" 
@MegsDeAngelis and if youtube didn't exist, but I love youtube too much x

@TanyaBurr your makeup in this vlog looks amazing, love you x 
@TanyaBurr you weren't annoying in the vlog (as you thought you might be) you were just super happy, so proud of you x

@ZozeeBo I have watched you since almost the beginning and I have watched you become an amazing woman, I love you x
Congrats on 7.5 million subscribers @ZozeeBo it isn't a milestone like 7 million but I wanted to congratulate you and tell you I'm proud x
@holydeyes goodluck, I have one this weekend and another one the weekend after, the stress! xx
@MarcusButler aren't we all x
@PointlessBlog what will you do when you are out and about and need to go on your phone in an awkward situation? x
When the world is dying and empty, 
Love will be left to end what it began,
And make a new beginning
