I don't think anyone has taught you that I just believe so put it together for you since you didn't realize it before
@rxsequrtz but I think it's all work with oneself to first accept yourself in order to allow yourself to accept others
@rxsequrtz to change people's mentality bc most of it has just been born into the minds of people
@rxsequrtz exactly until we as society stop being so close minded and stop categorizing people is when we will progress. Although it's hard
@rxsequrtz happy with yourself versus society
@rxsequrtz and others around them and how happy they are with who they are. A lot of knowing where you stand and what it makes you feel
@rxsequrtz I think the issue is one that is very present nowadays and especially one that deals a lot with how young people view themselves
@rxsequrtz this is really amazing.
Acceptable selfishness is when you choose to be selfish with how much of yourself you give to people
I am so done with being sick like it sucks so much ass
