@emilypat95 see rachael of course!

deciding to go on a dog walk at the hottest time of the day probably wasn't my brightest idea ever
sitting in the garden with a book in this weather is perfect
getting hiccups before bed is not ideal
not sure how I'd cope without my fan in this weather
I am a massive fan of custard creams
when saffy barks in her dreams while shes sleeping it is the cutest thing
on a ron pope hype #chilled
where is your dignity, where is your pride, where is the love that you once had inside? <HEADPHONE>
online shopping is so dangerous for my bank account
ribena and lemonade is the best drink for a hot day
