I don't need no shoulder, I'm gonna be a soldier

Say what you wanna say and let the words fall out.

I'm sad,hurt, angry, mad, disappointed. But you know what?I'll put a happy face and move on. It will hurt but I will survive.

Good bye my love..

I pretend to ignore you, But I really just miss you...
But I cant be honest I can't when I'm with you
&amp; I don't wana think it 4 once I'm telling u the truth
How can i do this..I try..I try..I try
You know it's hard to say my feelings change
There so much to hide so much to try
something ain't right &amp; I don't know how to fix it.
Cause All of my Kindness is taken for Weakness.

Sometimes its difficult to deal with other people...It's either they're sensitive or just narrow minded!
