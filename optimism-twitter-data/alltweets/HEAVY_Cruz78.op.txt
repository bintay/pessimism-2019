@Damien_CT_Davis well his pivot foot did come up, lol 
@Damien_CT_Davis pivot foot slid, like 1 foot, refs are paid to make calls like that
-Kyle Korver/Dr. Dre
@Damien_CT_Davis I am but he did travel, shuffled his feet like crazy. Anyone will tell you that
@Damien_CT_Davis you're blind
@Damien_CT_Davis 
@BleacherReport Korver traveled, Dez caught it, Winslow tipped it, Thanks Obama
@NBA YOU BETTER GET YOURE CRAP TOGETHER!! STOP RIGGING THESE GAMES WITH THESE BOOF ASS REFS
Clear as day, Korver traveled
Travel
If Hawks advance, they're getting swept
Well he won't always hit them, but this miss hurts <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
He was wide open too
DAMMIT OTTO
I would say a quick shot, but I don't want to give Atlanta time
Holy crap, could it be, time for the Truth??
Oh, it was Nene.. DC sports....
@SwerveDoee lucky ass Hawks man
Hawks hurt beal on purpose
Watch Korver hit a 3 here..............
@ATLHawks YALL ARENT GOOD!!! YALL STRUGGLING AGAINST WILL BYNUM! #1 SEED MY ASS
THEY GET SO DAMN LUCKY MAN I SWEAR
Dagger
Of course
Dammit man, I would love this if the Wizards would hit free Throws with ease
A Pierce 3 would be huge
Please
Please defense
At least fans get Chick fil a
2-2..............
@BIG_skew I just wish there was an option in real life to turn off injuries, like in 2K lol
With the way the ATL has been hitting these fluke shots, I don't know if there's enough time left for us to comeback, but never say never...
DAMMIT GORTAT
CMON MAN
AS SOON AS WE GET CLOSE MAN ALL THE TIME
And of course a turnover.....
Wizards gotta build on this momentum
Beal is doing his thing, someone else please step up
Wizards gotta turn it up, 4th quarter time, and a 3-1 lead is WAY better for an undermanned team
@ESPNcer DC sports
Gortat bruh
OF COURSE
Wizards free throws......
@SwerveDoee Kanye inspired suit
@uSTADIUM 4-0
Look at that, 7-0 run to open up the half! Slowly but surely
@jyintheflesh he's gonna go off lmao
@Damien_CT_Davis im sure he's one bad step away from an RG3... But since it's not a DC team he's good
@Damien_CT_Davis you know damn well if the Lebron was out for this series the Cavs would go back to being ass. DC sports Is just cursed
@Damien_CT_Davis Imao
@Damien_CT_Davis CAVS SUCK ASS
Shaq just called the Wizards the Bullets
@Damien_CT_Davis for next season.....
@Damien_CT_Davis he'll be back
@Damien_CT_Davis no Kevin Love, no advancing
@Damien_CT_Davis nobody wants to see the Hawks lmao, but I'd rather have Chicago in the ECF
@Damien_CT_Davis Bulls will advance....... So in that case numbers will lie
@Damien_CT_Davis Hawks are not that good....
Damn it to hell
Atlanta won't break 100.... At least I hope
Free Throws......
Remember, Atlanta did this Game 1.......
Gortat never contests Al Horford's shots
Game........idk
NBA wants a tie series
We're gonna lose because of these turnovers
Teague you're ass, stop acting all big
Hawks are good in this game..... Too good.... I expect them to crash and crash hard
Will Bynum everybody!! Lmao
Slowly getting out of reach
We NEED to strap down defensively
And of course defensively we slack
BRAZILIAN JESUS
GOD NENE
Wall would've sent that off the backboard
We're getting killed in the paint
Pierce doing his best Wall spin impression lol
THE TRUTH!!!!!
@chaddukes patriots back up Is Jimmy Garrapolo
@its_carolxo @Uni_Numbers @DevinMahina84 aren't players allowed to wear the same number as others during preseason and crap?

@TJ_CapsCrazy wouldn't surprise me if NY scores next here lol
Another Caps goal!!
LeBron!! Lmao
If this is another Bank shot game winner....
That's a #SoWizards moment for the Cavs
LMAO
Words can't describe how much I love this woman, so Happy Mothers Day madre! 
@its_carolxo get a selfie with him
OTTO PORTER BABY
The Hawks are trying to kill Beal now
Nene needs to put his hair in a bun the rest of the series
OTTO PORTER
@its_carolxo bet lol
@its_carolxo grab as many shirts as you can lol
Another Nene sighting
A nene sighting lmao
DC curse is 100% in effect
Ok now Pierce is down.....
I just saw Nene brick some shots in the pregame shoot around lmao. This is gonna be a long game
@uSTADIUM season ending injury of some kind
Such a horrible song by 
@itzmeaat I'm proud for you big dawg, keep on stuntin in Istanbul. Maybe I'll see you whenever you come for a visit lol
@itzmeaat I feel you bro, I might have to make my way out to Istanbul myself. I need to see the world outside of 'Murica

@itzmeaat idk lol I thought my mans Ataturk granted you political asylum
@itzmeaat did you get deported?? Lmao
@itzmeaat I keep on forgetting you're not in America lmao
WIZARDS GOT THIS DUB TOMORROW

DERRICK ROSE HOLY CRAP

@BleacherReport @AdamSchefter #SoJaguars
@BrittMcHenry @SportsCenter goodnight babe <FACE THROWING A KISS>
If Brady gets suspended, the NFL better get ready for Jimmy Garoppolo!
@rp0ch1r4 not yet, but I got a friend that had a similar wrist injury. he just told me that Wall is probably done for the year <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Please excuse my annoying voice but Benji finally howled back lol #dogs #BenjiIsAG 
@RealDealBeal23 let's get it bro! Time to show out! For @JohnWall

@_Heavyy @IamAkademiks but Arnold isn't the governor of California...............
Yo Mike Conley is bringing it early! Welcome Back
@_Heavyy I'm crying deep inside though
@upham_chase I have no idea lol might be an option on your cable remote,
@_Heavyy they will, for the love of DC <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@upham_chase you probably got the SAP option turned on lol
@_Heavyy not for the whole series lol Wall is DC, but when KD comes to DC, it'll be split between both of them
@_Heavyy funny thing is they still could've won this game! Sessions/Beal backcourt crushed Teague/Korver today, but our bigs got crushed
@SportsCenter Wizards in 6
Proud of the Wizards, still gave Atlanta some issues there even without Wall. Refs gotta chill though
Hawks need the refs help to win
Congrats Hawks, you barely beat a short handed Wizards team....
Thanks Nene
I will never give the Hawks credit. Just take away the 3's and like I said, you're left with a below average team.
Hawks still trash
Nene is trash this series
That's game
Yeah... That's not good
Cmon Wizards, strap down defensively and hit these shots, free throws too
PI3RC3
John Wall looking like a coach out there
Sessions bruh LMAO
Hawks should be embarrassed, barely beating a short handed Wizards team
Get Nene out please
Wall isn't even playing too lol 
Clear charge, refs definitely guessed on that call
@RudylovesMadrid he's just been a 3 point shooter his whole career, Hawks are weak in reality
Hawks just 3 point shooters, once they stop hitting them they're below average
Otto!
1 point game!
Sessions needs to put up at least 20 with 10 assists and Beal needs to go off!
Really really REALLY tough to think that my Wizards can win without J.Wall, but you never know... #optimistic #dcRising #hopeful
So excited and nervous for this Game 2 vs the Hawks. If we can pull off this game I'm calling for a series win! #dcRising
Driving my sisters #TLX for a bit #notmycar #acura #againimbored

JOHN WALL TO GORTAT BABY!!!!!
Wait, nvm
Beal is hurt, please sit him
Clear as day, charge on Atlanta... But these refs remain <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
Dammit man can't we pull away?
Cmon! Bad pass
Yes! OTTO
Beal is back!!!
Great Block by John!
That's a charge
Ok, good
If the NBA is rigged, that's a flagrant foul
This team needs to band together for Beal
Beal crying....... Not good at all
Some of the incidents are just freak accidents but still
Swear the Hawks are on a mission, if they can't beat us straight up, they'll injure our star players.
Great now Beal is hurt
@WashWizards Kyle Korver........
WHY CAN EVERY SINGLE PLAYER ON THE HAWKS HIT 3'S?!?
And just like that, Wizards are down 11 again
Game is not completely out of reach, but if we can't defend the perimeter, along with these suck ass refs, Atlanta leads 1-0 after this game
@brandynmarshall <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Nothing but 3's for atlanta
I don't think Wall is good, appreciate his guts
Atlanta is trash man
Wall broke his wrist
Garbage ass officiating causing this man
Well if Wall is out, this was a fun year
Dammit, Wall is hurt
Why does Gortat not like to dunk?
Atlanta isn't this good man, cmon Wizards
Damn it man, all Atlanta shoots is 3's
@SwerveDoee did you pull a Sam?
OTTO!!

@RColeBurroughs @SportsCenter regular season doesn't matter now, Raptors killed DC regular season but look how that turned out
@ESPNcer I'm already buying brooms for this next series lol
@_Heavyy I'm extremely optimistic lol. Hawks trash, just a good 3 point shooting team
@_Heavyy I changed my mind lol. Wizards in 4 <EYES>
Actually, I change my mind, WIZARDS SWEEPING ATLANTA!!!!

@ESPNcer I'm hoping man, but I feel like Dallas might scoop him...
Damn! The Caps steal one!
Thunderstorms with the fam 
@SportsCenter Wizards in 6
Brooklyn needs to put Deron Williams in for Jarrett Jack, Jack is hesitating on those jumpers and changing his mind mid-air.can't have that
Jarrett Jack is ass
Kyle Korver is trash, all he's good at is 3's. Take that away from him and you got a D-League player at best
Swear man everybody on the Hawks can shoot 3's
This Orioles game reminds me of that Empty Arena match The Rock had vs. Mankind

Pechulia lmao
AYYE!! caps!!!
@BenMehicNBA has to make us Wizards fans very optimistic! Especially how the team played vs.Toronto
I hate Baltimore lol
Some statistics I just looked up say cops have killed more whites than blacks in the past 2 years. Believable but I'm not sure
Baltimore sucked as a city to live in before this happened. Now it's official. No businesses or people will want to be in B-more for sure
I wonder if any of the protesters accidentally destroyed their homes and cars and set them on fire lol
@T_timestwo it just pisses me off how people think destroying a city and looting will resolve all the issues
Pisses me off how people think destroying a city will help bring awareness to "corrupt cops".
People in Baltimore got to chill out... What is a terrible place to live in already is being made worse by idiots


#WizRaptors #dcRising 
There go the Caps, well it's all up to the Wizards now! Make DC Proud!!! #dcRising
How much closer can you get
@SwerveDoee the truth 
At least the Wizards won in front of the home crowd  
Fav for Kyle Lowry 
They don't even want to talk about the Wizards on SportsCenter... They just went from Clips-Spurs, Rockets-Mavs, to hockey..... Smh
I repeat: The Wizards lead a playoff series 3-0. One more time: The Wizards lead …

#Wizards 106- Raptors 99

Gortat 24p-13r

“@ESPNNFL: WOW! The Colts have waived RB Trent Richardson 
Eagles fans swear they got a hall of fame running back lmao
Demarco Murray might be lucky to reach 1,000 rushing yards this season. I just don't see him being good w/o the Cowboys O-line
@stephenasmith is headed for a lot of sorrow. @RealSkipBayless is so wise. 
@ESPNNFL @AdamSchefter @emmann18 what do you think about Ryan Mathews ?
@ESPNNFL @Redskins <EYES>
Newly acquired Colts QB Sam Fuentes (@samueifuentes ) already practicing with friend and new Giants…

@rp0ch1r4 why is the McCoy jersey a 29??
@Rich_Crawford6 it's so painful to watch man. Worse than watching my 'Skins right now
Horrible late possessions, Missed free throws, and horrible defense cost us the game
The best the Wizards can do now is fight for the 7th or 8th playoff spot
The Wizards are only gonna win like 5 more games the rest of this season
@WashWizards Yall look like the flip Saunders Wizards
@WashWizards Yall suck
Making Free Throws are something the Wizards are allergic too
@JohnWall get randy fired please!!! Yall suck so much right now! Love you guys but Yall killing me and the whole DMV

UNCLE DREW!!

The Wizards are on fire right now <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
DR3W GOOD3N lmao

#fireWittman
“@ESPNcer: sorry ass team” I can't even watch them anymore

And the ship keeps on sinking @WashWizards
Free throws.......
Aaron Brooks #WizardKiller
@emmann18 you better hope chip kelly knows what he's doing
@emmann18 Yall cut trent cole too??
@emmann18 don't do it bro, he might trade you too
LeSean McCoy to the Bills for Kirk Alonso?!?!? What?!?!?!?
@Redskins looks like Ahmad Brooks might be available
I'm so mad that I just started watching The Walking Dead. I just started season 3 <WEARY FACE>
The buck stops with Frank. Help tip the scales. #TeamFrank #HouseofCards 
0.4 left???? The NBA is really trying to give LeBron and the Cavs this game.......
LeBron James 
These refs are officially blind
You've got to be kidding me...
Looks like LeBron has been practicing shooting Free Throws with the Wizards
I'm too SICED for Harden.
This game is so damn fun to watch man. James Harden putting LeBron on skates lol
These ESPN guys can't seem to find Lebron guilty of causing the scuffle
@ESPNcer with Green-Beckham, it's crazy how some off the field issues can hurt his value.

Since Kevin Garnett is making his first start in Minnesota tonight, it's only fitting that the Wolves crush the wizard......
@CSNWizards @CSNMA #WizardsTalk Gilbert Arenas

I just heard a Goldlink song on Sway in the Morning and everyone is feeling it
@rp0ch1r4 true, but everyone isn't showing effort, except for John Wall
@rp0ch1r4 I get it though, we suck so damn bad right now, and it's gonna get worse..
@rp0ch1r4 I meant 37
@rp0ch1r4 I think they only scored 87
This team has hit rock bottom, and it's so disappointing to see this after getting used to winning #WizardsTalk
Couldn't even grab a rebound at the end GEEZUS
The Wizards don't even try anymore
We can't even make layups
WHATS UP WITH ALL THESE SUCK ASS WIZARDS TRYING TO SHOOT FLOATERS
It just pisses me off how many 3's opposing teams shoot against the Wizards, and we barely shoot 3's.
#FireRandy
Well, this seems to be it for the Wizards this season.....
@rp0ch1r4 and he's gonna have that in the first quarter....

Free throws man

This team is pissing me off. I can't feel good about them. Looks like we're gonna lose 20 of the 28 games left

Oh no, Landon Collins is down.
Dudes getting smacked
TD TJ!!!
That was a safety yo!
Too Easy #alabama
@SwerveDoee that Redzone defense though! #rolltide
He can tackle
Keeping an eye on Landon Collins, hopefully the future Redskins safety

Officially 21!!! God I'm getting old
The Wizards are allergic to making free throws
Why are the Mavericks making every single shot man
2 hours until I'm 21. Shoutout to all the pear that turn 21 tomorrow too
Yeah the Wizards should just catch the flight to OKC right now
Nevermind
Well he's back #brazilianJesus
Nene injured.... Never good
Yeah, it'll be a miracle if the Wizards can comeback and win this game
Dallas almost got 70 at the half
The Wizards look like a team playing a back to back. Terrible
It's always these bum ass players that rejuvenate vs the Wizards
Why are all these bald headed bums so good against the Wizards?!?
Birthday in 4 hours #turning21 #blessed
Me - great question I appreciate you asking 
My Wizards!! We just beat a really good western conference team. I think if we pull out a few more wins vs the west, no one can talk
Idk why I am watching this movie

Of course this happens to the skins
Please don't let philly score on this kick return

GARÇON!!!! #SPINFIREPIZZA
@That1_Guy_DJ he's a stud lol
BREELAND
Ertz... Again......
I'm sitting here staring at 3-12 #Redskins
#Lt that's crazy
Sanchez has passed the ball 42 times
@granthpaulsen my guess is that Ertz, Cooper, and Celek will kill us on this drive
Trent Williams is such a warrior though, but I still don't want him out there risking further injury
Well look at that, ball took a while to come out of Bob's hand, and Fletcher actually made a play
Why is trent Williams out there? He only has 1 arm to block with!!!!
Yup, intercepted.....
Well it looks like we lost this game #Redskins
@chaddukes I still want an 8 hour #CDGDVTW show on Monday though.......
@SwerveDoee lmao coach Gruden hates you, Morris ain't getting these TD's
Hey philly, keep fletcher on Djax please lmao
John Wall #NBABallot
Redskins this season: 4
Eagles this game: 3
That was a nice run by Sproles
They just converted a 3rd &amp; 25
Wow, we have another lead!

Why is there so much people buying food at Wegmans, like damn. Don't y'all have leftovers? They're in here buying full meals and crap

@Ahhbner
Yo wal-mart actually has 25 registers open!!!!!
Getting that money #atm #wellsfargo 
@Getoutmylane22 he kind of looks like he forgot how to throw though. He might be paranoid because he knows the line sucks ass too
right now, Mike Shanahan is laughing his ass off at the Redskins organization. We thought Shanny was the problem, but we were wrong
@Getoutmylane22 bruh I don't even care lmao, let's put Garçon as QB. Heck let's trade RG3 for Geno Smith
Watch Colt McCoy win this game for the skins too lmao. I'll be done as a skins fan for the rest of the season
@Getoutmylane22 @RGIII I want cousins to start man, he moved the Chains
@Getoutmylane22 true, we gotta trade rg3 for some big ass Right tackle lmao
@Getoutmylane22 I'm pretty sure RG3 wants out of DC now, so trade him! I'll take Bortles because that kid could be a great QB and he's white
Lets trade RG3 to jacksonville for Blake Bortles
I think McCoy is alright,
But can we give Kirk Cousins another chance, since Washington wants to play around

@TJ_CapsCrazy hell yeah! Now with today's special effects and CGI, it'll be amazing
These people doing these "die-in" protests look so dumb
When you wanna protest but also get turnt AF with the homies  
@ESPNcer bills defense helped me come back too bro lmao
People destroying the place they call home. That's some dumb stuff right there. Like chill out

@heyimkatelyn @QTOF_Meatball77 no they don't sign up but you face the consequences of your actions. And that's with any race
I'm sure probation or whatever a person gets for stealing some cigarillos is WAY better then being shot and killed
I'm sure if Michael Brown complied with what the officer said then he would still be alive. But his actions led to his tragic death.
If Brown did steal those cigarillos, it means he committed a crime, so he wasn't really an "innocent kid".
@JamesMackDaily thanks for your service man!! It's people like you that allow me to live life without worries in this great nation!!!
Lmao at the People that think they sound smart on Twitter right now, like they're some CNN analyst or some crap
#lt like sit your ass down and go to sleep..... It's all wack and corny to me
And I hate seeing people on here posting all this pics of Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin, and Mike Brown... Trying to be "inspirational"
I don't hate the police, because without them, what kind of world would we live in? The actions of 1 cop doesn't mean all cops are like him
I mean Brown was beating up a police officer, who is just an average man trying to earn his daily bread and do what the law says is right
#lt but if brown did start beating the hell out of officer wilson, &amp; The officer felt in danger that he needed to shoot, can you blame him?
he did steal some cigarillos, but he didn't deserve to be killed............
Well the decision was made, nothing we can do for Michael Brown now... Let's just all stay put and not do anything dumb
I just realized that there's a cemetery just Howison..... 
Odell Beckham Jr. is a top receiver in this league man.

The defense needs to do its job here and stop the Vikings from driving down the field so easy
@DomVAPower ok power is back on and has stayed on. Thanks
Couldn't get the 2 point conversion
Touchdown Alfred Morris
Power back on, let's see for how long though
Why did I get a notification saying that the Redskins are up 19-14?
Wait a safety?? Lol
@DomVAPower my power was out, I reported it, came back on for about 3 minutes then it goes out again.
This wind needs to chill out man
So my power comes back, my cable box takes like 5 minutes to setup, finally starts working again and MY POWER GOES OUT AGAIN!!

#PHIvsHOU
C'mon Man, my power HAS to go out the only day I'm able to watch a Redskins game
