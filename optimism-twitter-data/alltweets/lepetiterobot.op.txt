@thugalini We're talking physiological responses. There is no "wrong" way for your body to react, male or female.
@thugalini men can get hard while they being raped. Women can orgasm.  still rape.
@thugalini not saying it's automatic for every woman. Some don't, some do. IJS being wet doesn't disqualify it as rape.
@thugalini you body responds to things. To fear, to sex. Not your brain, but your body, like how you start sweating suddenly. Physiological.
@thugalini rough sex is not rape. You  consented to what was happening. During an assault, your body can be tensed/braced for impact.
@thugalini Tearing can happen from the force/pressure, even if wet. Same with bruising if your body is tensed.
@thugalini So rape kit tests for forensic evidence like DNA left by rapist &amp; physical evidence of assault like tearing, bruising, swelling.
@thugalini It's a physiological response, it can happen. Doesn't mean you want/enjoy it.
@thugalini That is factually incorrect. Women can get wet, or even orgasm, when raped. Lack (or withdrawing) consent is what makes it rape.

By middle school, I simply couldn't engage my mother on the topic of sex. At 15, I got my doctor to tell my mom I wanted BC.
