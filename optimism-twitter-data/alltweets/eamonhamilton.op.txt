Was shocked by Wermacht Generals casual description of Jewish/European genocide; &amp; surprised by open contempt for Hitler/Nazi leadership
Scripting for 'Spying on Hitler's Army' comes from actual transcripts (translated) of conversations during their captivity
Just finished 'Spying on Hitler's Army', docudrama about MI19 recording conversations of captured Wermacht Generals 
@RAeSTimR still say you should fit a sensor suite on BBMF Lanc and send that after the subs.
Remember when people were talking about RAF getting Kawasaki P-1 for maritime patrol, and I said "that's a dumb idea"? Yeah, good times.
@Rotorfocus 1-2 boom-equipped Voyagers is a training capability anyway - cheaper to just borrow time on French/USAF/EU tankers
@Rotorfocus seems like it'd be hard writing it into the lease, having a jet come offline for that long
@Rotorfocus you could retrofit a boom to the....oh they're leased. Nevermind.
@Rotorfocus @BoeingDefense hoooooraaaaaay!!!
About to start @JohnBirmingham novel 'Ascendance'. I hope they resolve this conflict w/ diplomacy &amp; reason! #TheDave 
@nprmonkeysee Peggy walking into new office on Mad Men could almost have been the perfect finale for her! How good was it.
"Tomorrow night on 60 Minutes: Aussie Grandparents flying across the Grand Canyon". Someone get that Walkley ready.
Yaaaay Hercules! #DarkKnight 
I think I'm physically incapable of not watching #DarkKnight if it's on TV. They should replace one of the shopping channels with it on loop
#IronEagle, but during the mission, they get shot down because the US Navy are launching a rescue/raid from USS America
@chrisbrownie 1989 Gulf of Sidra tapes - go to 7min to hear the Pilot and RIO arguing 
Oh God that was awful  #IronEagle
You know it's the Cold War, and you could probably just lock Doug and Chappy up, right? Or, you know, a little 'wetworks'?  #IronEagle
Pleeeeease, send them to jail  #IronEagle
#IronEagle 
I live to make stupid memes of this screengrab #IronEagle 
@chrisbrownie I was way closer to the Nellis threshold at Red Flag  #IronEagle  #UnhumbleBrag
@chrisbrownie Tempted to mime being killed when I stand at the Darwin runway threshold during next Pitch Black  #IronEagle
Seriously, why does this country have such a bad integrated air defence system? What are they spending all their oil profits on?  #IronEagle
@RealNickHodge Iran Contra  #IronEagle
Hahahaha I know, right?! #IronEagle #GenevaConvention  
"Sorry Europe, no oil for you in Winter 1986/87" #IronEagle 
The oil refinery that Doug just threatened probably supplies western Europe with 18% of its crude, BTW  #IronEagle #NoBiggie
What if  #IronEagle, but Molly Ringwald as Doug
In the time Doug listened to that tape, he totally would have been shot down  #IronEagle
Half surprised Israelis didn't film this dogfight by engaging real Syrian MiGs #IronEagle 
@RealNickHodge Kinda. They're Kfirs, which is an Israeli-made version of the Mirage III powered by a US turbojet.
The paperboy riding after Doug the whole movie, through explosions, screaming "I want my $2!"  #IronEagle
What if  #IronEagle, but John Cusack from Better Off Dead as Doug Masters
I would *love* a movie told entirely from point of view of the baddies in these movies #IronEagle 
@gtlloyd I dont think this movie's quite on the level  #IronEagle
@chrisbrownie They know they can't get there on one tank of gas, right? #YomKippurWar  #IronEagle
I only ask because the Mediterranean is like a 19 hour flight from southern California  #IronEagle
Yaaaay the real hero appears  #IronEagle 
Are they launching this mission from the US or from a deployed base?  #IronEagle
This movie isn't all bad security, there's serious bits too  #IronEagle
"You aint ready for shit, boy!" -Lou Gossett Jnr, the audience, at the 67min mark of  #IronEagle
@twodrones @AirTanker hiyo!
Why does the use of the 'Hades Bomb' sound like a war crime  #IronEagle
@chrisbrownie So many easy jokes to be had here
YES CHILDREN THIS IS AIR TO AIR REFUELLING, pay attention it is important 
#IronEagle 
Doug's terrible dropping ordnance on the range. Who knew flying a $20m fighter bomber was hard work?  #IronEagle
Let's all have fun watching the continuity errors with the F16 in this sequence.  #IronEagle
What if  #IronEagle, but Pat Morita as Chappy 
"Bomb their air defence radars, add a little marrow - baby, you got a stew goin'!" #IronEagle
What if #IronEagle, but Carl Weathers from Arrested Development playing Chappy
*Chappy plays Godfather of Soul*
"How can you think with that music?"
Literally what I would listen to in my workspace #IronEagle
Fun fact: The Hunters in the back of that hangar are probably captured #IronEagle
Seriously, KGB probably watched this movie with a hard on. #IronEagle
Seriously, how bad was security at USAF bases in the 80s?  #IronEagle 
Holy shit the bad guy IS Poirot #IronEagle
@RealNickHodge Also, the background looks exactly like that 70s Jesus Christ Superstar adaptation.
@RealNickHodge Yeah man. That's why the MiG-23s are Kfirs.
In case you missed it, Doug just bragged about having more F16 sim hours than F16 pilots at the base. #IronEagle
"Mr President, an American F16 pilot was just shot and captured."
"Oh, I'm sure the State Department have this in hand." 
#IronEagle
Is #IronEagle set in an alternate reality where Ronald Reagan wasn't president in the 1980s? 
I sure hope Doug is cleared to operate that sim LOL jokes security at this base is terrible #IronEagle
@chrisbrownie "Sorry Doug, I'd come help you out, but Sally Peterson promised me third base behind the bleachers after prom."
Intel kid gives a back brief on his dad's briefing. Holy shit, does anyone at this base practice OPSEC?! #IronEagle
Hahaha totally forgot #IronEagle had a prom scene 
"Colonel, thank you for that last shipment of Cobra helicopters." #IronEagle #IranContra 
@chrisbrownie Oh come on, we haven't even been to see the bad guys yet  #IronEagle #badaccents
@chrisbrownie Hahahahaha! No.
Hey, speaking of international airspace, has anybody listened to the tapes of the Gulf of Sidra shootdown?  #IronEagle
That's twice in this movie where Doug has blustered his way through a security checkpoint in  #IronEagle
@gtlloyd This is where the real story of  #IronEagle should have been
What sort of mad dog Seal Team Six headset/mic is Doug wearing?  #IronEagle
@chrisbrownie kts, right?
USAFA Commandant: Do you have a Doug Masters registered?
Flying Club: Sure, he flies 50ft races all the time
DENIED 
 #IronEagle
There is no serious way the motorbike could beat the Cessna here  #IronEagle
They're wearing matching Flying Club jackets? That's adorable.  #IronEagle
"We saw your driving, and you're a liability. Sincerely, the USAF Academy." #IronEagle
Oh no the denim gang #ironeagle
lol at the town being called 'Alta Vista', do you think their neighbours are Bing? #ironeagle
Seriously, the USAF actively fought against the reckless driving he demonstrates #ironeagle
WATCH HOW HE DRIVES IN THIS SCENE. No wonder he gets rejected from the academy. #ironeagle
Seriously how good were bedrooms in the 80s #ironeagle
(I learned it from a book) #ironeagle 
Fun fact: 1970s-era USAF radars IDed the MiG-23 as a DC-10 because of the radar return off  the face of their large turbojet #ironeagle
Uhhh, rules of engagement much? #ironeagle
I love how all information is conveyed to the pilots in txt form #ironeagle
"System Check - OK" k thx F16B flight computer #IronEagle
We are GO #IronEagle 
Anyone else doing the #IronEagle live tweet-a-long in 20min? 
Also, I don't rate legitimate Russian tourists terribly highly. Sorry.
those treads will come in handy if camping ground roads get bogged! 
@pattonoswalt ping my favourite airline/customer romance, @VirginAustralia &amp; @chrisbrownie
Re-watching The Phantom Menace. Palpatine's got a whole Frank Underwood thing happening in this Senate.
I almost want Peggy to not come back for the series finale. This was just so good. 
A. They have, and they also made this 
Has someone gif-ified Peggy yet? 
@Eve_Beauregard like the Jurassic Park novels, there's the 'workspace', then you have a secret messy workspace in the shed. Or some such.
@Eve_Beauregard that workspace is too neat. I refuse to believe it.
Still looks like a 10yo's drawing of an supersonic airliner @sabinewolff @chrisbrownie  
@HayesBrown how would you hope to report it objectively?
This joint really needs its own merchandise

Remove one of those words &amp; that would still be an awesome sentence #FreeComicBookDay
I'm optimistic that some day, I'll see a V22 Osprey, &amp; god willing, it'll  be a pretty happy moment in my life 
@chrisbrownie @VirginAustralia sure how you weren't seated in seats 15A/B on the flight up.
@chrisbrownie i specifically came to Melbourne this weekend (by @VirginAustralia I might add) to touch all your stuff while you're gone
@chrisbrownie @VirginAustralia I cyber troll you like all the time!
@chrisbrownie @VirginAustralia oh,  mercy. That was quite the exchange.
@stock_jaryd @scobro11 mere facts!
@stock_jaryd @scobro11 no one's blaming you guys for this weekend - correct call. Also, see Murphy's Law
@digit13 DO IT
Return fares from SYD-LAX are as expensive as return fares from SYD-NYC via LAX. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.
@davegledhill1 @TheBaseLeg @alert5 I know an ex-RAF C130 pilot who did Argentine exchange
@NZAircraftFan Yah seems to be a fair bit of crossover
@NZAircraftFan Delta operates a B777 SYD-LAX
Has anybody flown Delta to the US from Aus, and if so, yay/nay?
@falcon124 You're on board?
@TheBaseLeg Ahhhh Why did you remind me
I would also follow Twitter Pics of:
4. Inter-war RAF transports.
5, 1950-80s era KC135s.
6. Military Airlift Command
@NigelPittaway1 @TheBaseLeg @adammudhen Currently comparing beer menus. It's coming down to the wire.
I would follow Twitter accounts that posted nothing but photos of following:
1. Harriers
2. Bucanneers
3. V-Bombers
@TheBaseLeg @NigelPittaway1 @adammudhen Happy to go to Cookie or European after Hanks, if easier. Also trying to entice @falcon124 out
@davegledhill1 @TheBaseLeg @alert5 I don't know - can't say the Skyhawk will limp away with that damage!
I would happily follow a Twitter feed that was all Buccaneer pictures. 
@davegledhill1 @TheBaseLeg @alert5 no worries! Saw that was case when I read the blurb.
Hey @TheBaseLeg @alert5 - some F4 jockey shooting down Singa A4! 
@digit13 @_kieranoconnor @bernardocamejo meet up!
@sabinewolff <OK HAND SIGN>🏻
@sabinewolff were you keen to come? We'll be talking about planes.
@adammudhen @TheBaseLeg @NigelPittaway1 will probably arrive ~1245hrs at Fancy Hanks. Is there a pub nearby we can go to after?
@scobro11 it is - everyone is pointing the weather finger at first wkend in May, saying it should be held later in year.
Holding @WingsIllawarra on first wkend of May begs re-examination, but this could also be Murphy's Law at play.
The local #avgeek community appears to have taken the news quite well, though.
Sympathies to organisers of @WingsIllawarra for having to cancel this weekend. But entirely the right call to make.
Just booked ticket. This will be grand.
@agbrowne99 You are why we can't have nice things
Any Twitter peeps keen to see David Kilcullen and @captainbrown for SWF on 22MAY15? 
GALLERY: RAAF C17A brings Australians out of Kathmandu following Nepal earthquake 
@chrisbrownie ok yes I know it's 14min but it's also awesome and heaps 50s
@chrisbrownie @NewtonMark @sabinewolff needs more Hercules 
@Airminded @sabinewolff or as I like to call it, "Top Gun if we lost the war"
@TheBaseLeg @NigelPittaway1 @adammudhen wanna catch up after 1530?
@alexander_drake @sabinewolff I feel like I need a hologram to explain this to me
@sabinewolff I just keep appreciating it more as a grown up.
@sabinewolff (she once ate a pork knee in Prague)
@sabinewolff i asked partner if she wanted to eat lamb shoulder for dinner Saturday. I got a "that's a stupid question to ask me" look.
@NigelPittaway1 sounds good! Hey @TheBaseLeg @adammudhen, are you free to come along?
I realise FB is international, but i suspect a good number are Nepalese ex-pats in Oz.
Didn't realise extent of Australian Nepalese population until I saw RAAF FB post about today's C17A aid flights: 5600 likes.
@sabinewolff @TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk fancy hanks 1230 Saturday. Pub after/later if not.
@TheBaseLeg @adammudhen @NigelPittaway1 doing Fancy Hanks Saturday ~1230h if you're interested. Can meet at pub after/later if not.
@sabinewolff @TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk (but the suggestion was welcomed)
@sabinewolff @TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk that was how I was leaning
@sabinewolff @TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk that could be a lock
@sabinewolff @TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk Fancy Hanks is a lock for Saturday, deciding whether lunch or dinner
@TheDaveSinclair @LukePrestonInk @sabinewolff partner wants to know if Meatballs are good at Meatball &amp; Wine Bar. The wine only has to be ok
@errolwi @AusAviation yeah. Not a fan of the author.
@AusAviation admittedly, that view in the article is quoted from a NZ Political Party media release.
Reading @AusAviation at the moment - this whole "two C17As can only be on two places!" argument really needs to be discarded.
RAAF sends C17As to Nepal w/ aid, &amp; to evac Australians/foreign nationals from Kathmandu 
Ex-RAAF C130E, now with Pakistan Air Force, assisting with Nepal earthquake relief 
@RowlandWhite I even like the Hercules
@UPROXX why does your site constantly redirect me to the App Store?  It's now gotten to point where I can't read it.
@bajopants you're wearing a tie! What's the occasion
It was safely unloaded in accordance with the BLIs? 
This C27J landing will change the way you think about austere runways #RAAFBuzzfeed
Pffft! C17A galley or nothing! 
@tellmemo Buzzfeed is a well-known Internet news site that utilises click-bait headlines to attract readers.
"If Air Mobility Group aircraft were Disney characters" #RAAFBuzzfeed
"They thought it was just another Super King Air, but then they saw who it belonged to." #RAAFBuzzfeed
Correction! Last one should be "What kind of KC30A fuel receiver are you?" #RAAFBuzzfeed
"Which jet looks best refuelling from a KC30A MRTT?" #RAAFBuzzfeed
'What they're unloading from this C17A will change the way you think about strategic airlift' #RAAFBuzzfeed
Trying to think of Buzzfeed-esque headlines for a forthcoming social media project. "15 places we've sent a RAAF Hercules to" #RAAFBuzzfeed
(Multi Rôle Tanker Transport) 
Surely we can't be too far off from Rammstein songs being used in Car Insurance or pharmaceutical commercials?
Dawn Service flypast by RAAF C130J Hercules in Middle East Region 
@sabinewolff @chrisbrownie I go about 8min into a meeting before I start doodling planes. AND OUR OFFICE WALLS HAVE PICTURES OF THEM.
Fun fact: Professor Tank's field is actually in 18th Century Literature.  
@sabinewolff @chrisbrownie 
@chrisbrownie @sabinewolff When I look at the Convair Kingfish design I just think "oh, bless them"
Of course Melbourne is getting Book of Mormon first
@eamonhamilton attn @sabinewolff @LukePrestonInk @TheDaveSinclair please suggest locations for consumption of meats
My priorities this Saturday:
1. Check into hotel
2. Attend free comic book day 
3. Pork in some roast/BBQ format
@csimps0n how else am I supposed to have an opinion of airconditioning on Lamborghinis now?
Have I done that tweet before? Feels recycled
My life goal is to write a story from Australian history before it gets done by @Peter_Fitz
@TheBaseLeg second one
@vaughndavis did you divide by zero?
Melbourne peeps, let's catch up Saturday for lunch. Recommend a venue that serves large portions of pork.
@sabinewolff there's this trans-Siberia railway route through Central Asian states like Uzbekistan &amp; Kyrgyzstan that I want to go on
Bunnings laid a wreath at my #AnzacDay Dawn Service this morning. Bunnings. As in, the store.
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce acknowledged, wish you well for tomorrow
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce it is a very, very useful jet!
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce can you send the URL for the page with the dodgy link?
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce likely both - but again, would have to check task board.
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce but yes, we use KC30A as tanker for Op OKRA
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce there's 270 seat capacity up top, so can be used for transport
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce just quietly, I think we could do better than Efes!
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce without knowing precise details of task, I would say it is transporting ADF/Aus Govt contingent for Anzac ceremony
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce it is indeed - KC30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport. So, a converted Airbus A330
@abcmatt @Aus_AirForce yep - in hindsight, should probably have held onto that account. Will let them know!
@abcmatt it's now @aus_airforce. Supposing number of American veterans were directing their Twitter commentary at us, hence the change!
@toddsampsonOz @charliepick I haven't watched #TheWeekly yet, but could think of many worse things than to be compared to John Oliver.
What the frick? 
I never click Buzzfeed links, but 'Which 'Too Many Cooks Character Are You'' is too compelling to pass up 
@WendyfWilson hasn't Canberra had enough this year :-/
@csimps0n hahaha!
@TheDaveSinclair mmhmm. Totally underrated.
@TheDaveSinclair like, the west had stopped two communist actions in Asia in 50s - of course they were going to carry that through in 60s
@TheDaveSinclair can't help but point to this conflict when people start criticising the rationale of the domino theory
@TheDaveSinclair no kidding?
The Malayan Emergency, in case you're asking.... #FavouriteUnderratedConflict
Video from @TheFeedSBS parodying Interns, Gallipoli coverage (ping @captainbrown) 
There's a great feature in latest @AIR_Intl about Exercise Red Flag in its 40th year @NellisAFB 
Operation Babylift re-enactment on 'Australia: The Story of Us' last night. 
I still think C130A would have been revolutionary to late 50s RAAF, if there'd been a transition-type like C53.
@gileshardie @702sydney mazel tov!
Say, something like C119 or C53, or even C-97.
Re: last RT about @APDC_AirPower C130A brief, i do wonder what impact on RAAF would have been in post-war transports replaced C47 sooner

Easily my favourite joke of this movie 
@SharlynEgger #PearlHarborWasAnInsideJob
@dave_lang Australia - The Story Of Us. Should be on Seven website tomorrow
Now this is happening 
Hey, my work was just on TV 
@TheFeedSBS I get a white feather too, right?
@marcfennell I walked in halfway through that @TheFeedSBS Gallipoli pitch - where can I watch it again because it looked hilarious
@chrisbrownie @Smartraveller fun fact! Most Defence bases won't be shut, unless it's a state public holiday (which it isn't, for most part)
@KyleMizokami @NAVAIRNews I would have been, like, way lazier.
@chrisbrownie @VirginAustralia raaaargh. I want to go Sept school holidays.
@chrisbrownie @VirginAustralia LINK
"Adult" DIY Workshops? I wonder if Bunnings does Hens Nights/Bucks Parties 
More fool me - @NAVAIRNews said X47 received 4000lbs of fuel 
(Which is still impressive in-and-of itself, but technically, this isn't an air-to-air refuelling, unless fuel was, you know, transferred)
Did the X47 actually receive fuel? Have my suspicions the probe is just an instrumented bolt-on. 
Took photos of Dad's garage. Now having second thoughts about opening up about extent of my family's #avgeek -ness.
Well done, calibri. You've come through again #writersblock
That moment when you struggle to write a story, and start blaming the font.
I was pleased with comprehensive range of airlift options presented in Avengers: Age of Ultron. A logistical delight. 
I am totally Periscoping in the latest RAAF News! 
Oh, boy! Avengers totally showcased the importance of different kinds of airlift! There was strat, AME, tac, airdrop, HADR - the whole lot.
Seeing Avengers. Hoping to see well-executed use of strategic &amp; tactical airlift to accomplish mission objectives.

@csimps0n I thought we were going in halves on a French castle??? 
@TheBaseLeg @G_Steuer 10pts, Gryffindor.
@G_Steuer @TheBaseLeg it sure is. So, what Belgian fighters will an A400M be compatible with refuelling, then?
@TheBaseLeg what's that going to be compatible with :-/
@COMINT_AU "so that's where all the F14 spares have been going"
From my tourist-knowledge of French, can we assume Belgium are getting A330 MRTTs? 
The KGB. Defecting Spies. A RAAF Dakota. The Petrov Affair, 61 years on.

Just ordered DVD 'Untold Stories of RAAF Caribou'. So many special features coming my way! 
@sabinewolff it's like this weird metal boardprint which I dont like but it's about flying biplane airliners to North Africa which I do like
@sabinewolff also 
@sabinewolff ok, so it's not on my wall, but in my study: 
@sabinewolff @kebabman @chrisbrownie I'll post photo of his garage one day, but be warned, it will change you...
@chrisbrownie that's not even the half of it. Not even the hundredth.
Dad just sent me photo of USS John C Stennis in his frontyard. Good to see he's enjoying his retirement. 
@sabinewolff fairly certain a variation of that design sits in my study area.
@KyleMizokami oh, so not out of business :-P
@KyleMizokami how's that even possible? Those places cost nothing to rub.
@chrisbrownie @sabinewolff lovely!
@NZAircraftFan dunno. That MiG seems pretty easy to sneak over the border.
Suuuuure, 'practicing'... 
Apparently my Çanakkale kebab recommendations earned me a shout out from @mjrowland68 on ABC's @BreakfastNews this AM. Achievement unlocked!
Hey Melburnians, are you free for catch up on May 1-2?
The teaser for Star Wars: Rogue One is once again a pleasing demonstration of the importance of tactical mobility 
Q. Can you fit a Toyota Landcruiser into a RAAF C17A?
A. Yes. Yes you can.

@mjrowland68 (purple pin is Trojan Horse, for reference)
@mjrowland68 try along Tekke Sokak (red pin). I haven't had anything to drink tho, so this could be a fool's errand 
That moment when @mjrowland68 makes a joke on ABC Breakfast about getting a doner kebab in Çanakkale, &amp; you know exactly where to get one.
@sabinewolff 
@PodBlart @Joabyjojo will he have a scooter or some hilarious Segway substitute? What will be the nature of his facial hair? Questions.

@PodBlart @PatchKolan the Assassination of Kevin James by the Coward Paul Blart
@PodBlart @PatchKolan I mean, it can be taken as a given that you'll be reviewing 'Paul Blart with a Vengeance' &amp; 'Live Free or Paul Blart'
@darkhorizons I want 'Star Wars Vacation', where Han &amp; Leia take the kids and the Millennium Falcon to Wally World
@PatchKolan @PodBlart will this be a one off, or will Pod Blart move on to other films? &amp; what's to stop it from becoming a deadhorse whip?
@DarkLaughterTDB @Mipeck1 Class IX would suit Lambda shuttles &amp; other ex-Imperial kit; would also deny spares for Imperial garrisons
Hey Melbourne/Hobart, we appear to have received your weather by some sort of clerical error. 
@darkhorizons Top Gun. Dogfights = tick. Gay subtext = tick.
@DarkLaughterTDB @Mipeck1 I like to imagine a reasonable percentage of Rebel log sustainment was via captured convoys.
@SharlynEgger what's the photo caption?
@DarkLaughterTDB switching methods for moment then - attacking imperial convoy escorts.
@DarkLaughterTDB we don't know what other factors were. May have been a transport shortfall at the time (strategically flawed tho)
@marcfennell I'm so excited to see Captain EMBARGO and EMBARGOman face off again in this one!
(Or whether they really can be birdstruck from behind)
(Like whether they can take off backwards in a headwind)
(Also the narrator is the guy from MythBusters, so I keep expecting them to test a Caribou myth)
Untold Stories of the Caribou has actually been pretty good so far
Untold Stories of the Caribou is also available on DVD - check out 
@DarkLaughterTDB convoy protection against smaller Cap ships
@DarkLaughterTDB arguably, both Death Star destructions were matters of necessity. First for their life, second a political assassination
Untold Stories of the Caribou now available to watch online 
@DarkLaughterTDB wouldn't necessarily work - like why USAF employs AC130 under fighter escort. Even the Falcon went to Endor w/ fighters
@DarkLaughterTDB Bwings are meant to take down Cap ships, like an anti-shipping missile. But once in charge, how to rebels fill void?
Capital ships in #StarWars are policing vessels as much as combat - with rebel fleet being smaller, what's their long term security plan?
@DarkLaughterTDB but at what cost, logistically
@DarkLaughterTDB I e read a little into it - does make sense when you consider they were fighting asymmetrically against capital ships
@DarkLaughterTDB A-wing was undoubtedly rushed into that battle
@DarkLaughterTDB Soontir Fel's posting to 181st now makes organisational complete sense
@DarkLaughterTDB I agree now. Look at that! Someone on Twitter changed my opinion!
@DarkLaughterTDB agreed. Meanwhile, Rebels over reliant on Imperial defectors or 'natural' talents, rather than breeding the talent in-house
@DarkLaughterTDB Imperials likely to place their top pilots in zones likely to face Rebel contacts.
@DarkLaughterTDB Empire meanwhile has mass produced millions of TIEs and Pilots, a limited number of whom see bona fide combat
@DarkLaughterTDB impression I get is Rebels similar to USAF in Vietnam - some survive 10 missions &amp; are better for it.
@DarkLaughterTDB "Jack-squat", judging from their employment tactics.
@nprmonkeysee reading your Lucas/Colbert piece now, do you know if there'll be a podcast from event organisers?
I guess we're going to see a C17 in 'Spectre' @TheBaseLeg 
@DarkLaughterTDB leading us down a merry path of software and Block upgrades that provide over-reliance on manufacturer.
@TheBaseLeg its in my DNA!
@DarkLaughterTDB if anything, the TIE Advanced was a gold-plated boondoggle, albeit one that valued pilot's lives.
@DarkLaughterTDB I'm not sold on these new TIEs, whose solar arrays appear to be made of solid ivory.
@TheBaseLeg @JosephHDempsey irony of Royal Moroccan Air Force being used as Soviet stand ins for The Living Daylights
@TheBaseLeg @JosephHDempsey oh lord, it's World War Z all over again :-S
@marcfennell you didn't work in a "Rural Juror" reference in Moore's Law segment on @RNDownload - so many "Orr" sounds!
The James Bond series on iTunes will get you 18 months on Netflix. 
Can someone explain why cost of buying Star Wars series is the same as a year's Netflix subscription?
Hull design is almost nothing like other TIE models (if I didn't know any better, if say it's a turret shooting backwards).
And whilst everyone is being distracted by flying stormtrooper in this scene, no one is analysing the TIE model 
Are we seeing similar Imperial procurement as Russia, w/ multiple production lines turning out similar platforms (Su30)?
If the TIE Interceptor was supposed to progressively replace the TIE Fighter, then what are we seeing in Episode VII? 
@ccroucher9 oh snap!
@EPI1993 yeah that wasn't ot
Apparently the SR71 was retired in 1989, a surprise to those who flew it from 1994-98.
Just got through watching the SR71 episode of 'Planes that changed the world'. Bit light and loose with facts.
I realise they don't want me to call it 'Lady Ghostbusters', but it sounds too fancy for me not to like.
How did I forget that Claire Underwood was in The Princess Bride

Slow clap in D-minor, Kevin. Way to make her earn it.
@CrispinBurke "I'm going to have a female Admiral!"
"Yay, gender equality!"
"Did I mention she's insanely incompetent?"
"<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>"
@CrispinBurke @Aelkus @rmehlinger @DzirhanDefence and almost entirely reserved for Senior Sirs. Pure elitism.
@CrispinBurke @rmehlinger @DzirhanDefence we don't speak of Kevin J Anderson's so-called 'contributions' to the EU
Anyone notice, this isn't your grandfather's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer? Note the longer lower-hull on the bow 
Episode VII will have a Gonk Droid! Outstanding. 
@DzirhanDefence we've been through this before - Y-Wings are the A10s of the saga
Gallery: USAF MC130Js from @KadenaAirBase at RAAF Richmond for Ex Havoc Survey 
@armarvin @rmehlinger it's a fine ship - but the T65-blindness induced by these movies belittles the contribution of other platforms
@csimps0n Or better yet, a six-part series on AMC
@csimps0n see how they split now? 
@csimps0n the wings are quite different as well. Evident in the first teaser
Look, TIEs aren't my bag, but the TIE Adv is a game changer. It carries shields and is built for purpose. 
We're now Space Mobility Group, reflecting expanded nature of our operations  
Encouraging to see new Imperial transports being fielded - recognition of the importance of tactical lift. 
@csimps0n Y-Wings built to fight yesterday's Clone War, &amp; whilst effective at Yavin &amp; Endor, their era has past. 
Meanwhile, warbird TIE Fighters are repainted to represent newer TIE models. Come on, Lucasfilm, just use CGI already 
Incom has lobbied ($$$) to have their new X-Wing featured in Trailer. We're supposed to forget about the B-Wing? 
@emilycrockett @DLind follow @AthertonKD and @philewing, share more if you find them!
People, this isn't fair, I've got a *lot* of work to knock over this afternoon. 
@philewing what say you to reports that TIE Interceptors are being forced on Squadrons, whilst TIE Advanced are kept for senior Sirs?
@pptsapper @AthertonKD @_MikeDenny consider that countries borders/coasts are all different. Blockaded planets likely similar dimensions.
@pptsapper @AthertonKD @_MikeDenny presumably easier to blockade a planet in their universe, than a country in ours.
@jonostrower @airliners_net "diet coke, please"
@snerdish it's more like "guys, we KNOW he's coming, quit trying to hide it."
@snerdish Bespin
Can't help notice that 4-LOM has been noticeably absent from these trailers 
@JohnBoyega allow it
Mel Brooks was right. The Falcon really was just a flying Winnebago 
You know every war movie where someone flips out over reflected sunlight giving away their position? 
This guy. 
@AthertonKD @DavidKlion thas'right
Apologies to whoever I stole this idea from (@AthertonKD I think?) 
This excites me almost as much as the trailer 
"I...I crashed the Star Destroyer."
"No, I crashed the Star Destroyer."
"Guys, stop. I crashed the Star Destroyer." 
TIE pilots know that they're 0 and 40 against the Falcon, right? 
Me watching this trailer. 
Whenever they're in need, they all do it.... 
Who knew Vader's helmet was made of...old bread, I guess? 
Maybe the opposite - the market is flooded. Any John Q Moisture-farmer can walk outside and catch a TIE in his hat 
@AthertonKD Vietnam planet
Like, would the Jawas salvage it first, or go apeshit acting out some revenge fantasy on that sand crawler the empire wasted
@marcfennell you missed a premium trolling link opportunity there
@BarefootBoomer @pptsapper @SharlynEgger more for me
Assuming that they're on Tatooine, I can't help but feel the first Jawas who saw this Star Destroyer probably fainted 
@BarefootBoomer @pptsapper @SharlynEgger not even the pod race?
My favourite part of the Star Wars trailer is where it's all like "pew pew pew! Reeeeow!" 
@melissafumero @iamstephbeatz for real? That's awesome!
@SBSNews good morning! Did you see the new Star Wars trailer? 
@RhiannaPatrick we call them tactical naps, or 'tacnaps'.
Hate being chained to the desk - RAAF, Singaporean, and USAF C130s on flightline outside my office!
@DustyLeeCook ha! For real!

Can you blame them? #GetSome #OohRah 
@AthertonKD just like The Professional!
The urn wasn't hot when I made my first cup of coffee, but is hot now. Never a dull moment in MY workplace!

@DustyLeeCook @LockheedMartin Graham
The SR71 docos on YouTube aren't the same
Oh and attn Australians: Planes that changed the world, the SR71, is only on SBS On Demand till this weekend
I want to perfect that narrator's voice/style...
Seems to be an emerging trend in English aviation documentaries for narrator to keep using superlatives, slightly over-emphasising events
@DzirhanDefence @ForecastIntl giving it a bit of the old Loren Thompson
@SharlynEgger sometimes when I go to buy a newspaper, there are planes dropping paratroops!
@NZAircraftFan i had to check before I was sure
@NZAircraftFan Lancastrian had long nose and pax windows
@NZAircraftFan @stock_jaryd @Gshirt42 nope, straight up secondhand converted Lancaster, I believe.
@TheDaveSinclair 
@stock_jaryd @Gshirt42 there's really only one sensible choice 
@stock_jaryd @Gshirt42 I guess we shall have to wait and see.
@iiNet @iiSdQ broadband in Kellyville Ridge NSW seems to be its normal self again - I can watch my shows now! Cheers.
Broadband works again! Now, Netflix or SBS On Demand?
@TheBaseLeg @AbouDjaffar @SharlynEgger @CombatAir that saying did not end where I thought it would
@SharlynEgger on closer inspection
You appear to have a Star Wars tshirt in your profile pic <OK HAND SIGN>🏻
@SharlynEgger @CombatAir @TheBaseLeg Aaaaah I want to use that saying somehow!
@SharlynEgger Turkey, Israel, Netherlands. Maybe Singapore and S.Korea.
@SharlynEgger 9+3 on F35.
@TheBaseLeg @SharlynEgger I get the impression that most of their fighter replacement programs are in a bit of a state.
@SharlynEgger @TheBaseLeg Russia's got its own issues with India, allegedly, on the Su30/FGFA.
@SharlynEgger Either.
@SharlynEgger Uh huh. How many customers, now?
This is going to be AWESOME *gets popcorn* 
@wolfblitzer @nbcsnl @CNNSitRoom aaaah! That's awesome!
The prospect of Sydney having a proper grown-ups airport excites me. 
@iiNet @iiSdQ hahaha I think they called me back at 12.30am. Points for trying, I appreciate the effort.
@sabinewolff ironically enough, Turkey.
@iiNet @iiSdQ an hour?
@iiNet @iiSdQ I never got a call back <PENSIVE FACE> and it's late
@TheBaseLeg oh good they're chasing all the Beechcraft Baron market
@iiNet @iiSdQ (don't get me wrong, I totally appreciate that this is a first world problem)
@iiNet @iiSdQ yep, did that. Just logged in to iiNet mobile app, and saw advisory of On-Net/Off-Net degraded service <PENSIVE FACE>
@iiNet @iiSdQ second night and broadband is still snail-pace. Waiting on customer support call back :-(
What a fine harbour! 
I swear, the Indians are going to walk out on tarmac one day and see a dozen Rafales there, whether they agreed to them or not.
I see Terminator: Genesys is steering into the skid, with their latest trailer. Interesting ploy.
@sabinewolff nil broadband tonight so I had to watch Lord of War on SBS2, which is every bit as conflicting as I remember it.
@sabinewolff SBS On Demand will have them
@iiNet (I am assuming the greater Western Sydney network is struggling under the combined weight of Netflix and GoT...)
@iiNet Kellyville Ridge NSW has had poor broadband speeds tonight - do you know of any faults?
Im coming to the realisation that I don't actually need to use the word 'actually' in 95% of cases.
Contrast with RAAF B707 in Op SLIPPER, 2002: more than 6m lbs of fuel offloaded in 6 months (with 2 jets) 
@sabinewolff ACCORDION 
@sabinewolff SLIPPER 
In 6 months, RAAF KC30A has offloaded more than 16 million pounds of fuel for Op OKRA - more than 7200 tonnes. 
WW2 RAAF Recruiting poster at Base Newsagent/Post Office (
@senorschubert @usairforce ...neither of which is terribly easy to see early in the morning!
@senorschubert @usairforce only difference are the markings! Ours have a Stallion on tail, theirs' have a Stars and Stripes....
@senorschubert @usairforce that would be a C17 - giveaways are the winglets on the wingtips.
Hey @NetflixANZ , you don't need to send me emails asking "Netflix tonight?" Just take it as a given.
@sabinewolff something tells me this video's not on the level, but if you GoPro cat, play 'From Russia With Love' 
@sabinewolff GoPro ur fetch cat
@sabinewolff 5/5 would periscope again
@Deadly_Thoughts ahhh!
@Deadly_Thoughts well you're shit out of luck. Thanks, Go!
Damnit, Go! Space Jam is NOT Space Balls! 
@sabinewolff @chrisbrownie @EllieCK nice! Almost has a Saul Bass feel to it.
@sabinewolff @chrisbrownie @EllieCK this sits on my BR wall. Got it in Paris. 
Great ad placement from @smh story on Easter jewel heist in London. 
Yes, the navigator really is doing a negative-G somersault in the C130 cockpit 
@gearupflapsup great video!
I just got RT'ed by @EmbajadaEspAust ! I voted there in 2013!
@nashvilledrones mate, impossible to tell from that shot - I only knew cause I was on it :-)
Coolio's 'Gangsta's Paradise' is a song about the A10 Warthog. It's so abundantly obvious. 
KYLE did you EVEN read the lyrics? Clearly it's about the A10.  
@jonoabroad natural evolution, really
@TheBaseLeg oh come on.
@jonoabroad he's giving grief to Pfeiffer but I don't think he's upset with her
Who exactly is Coolio upset with in 'Gangsta's Paradise'?
@COMINT_AU @TheBaseLeg holy shit that hits home
@andrewmagoo19 @northropgrumman was very excited to see it
Forgot about this tweet from 2wks ago. Whenever I want to gross people out, I describe the sex scene from #TopGun 
@COMINT_AU @VirginAustralia 20min train to Town Hall, dinner, then &lt;60min bus ride home. I can live with that #BadgerysCreekNowwww
How much does @VirginAustralia love me? 10min early arrival into Sydney, 5min wait for baggage. On a Friday afternoon. Great work, team.

You can *just* make out the @northropgrumman logo on the KC30A MRTT Hangar at Brisbane Airport @andrewmagoo19 
@geoffrey_payne I'm sure they're lovely folk but they're not my problem!
@geoffrey_payne actually, 'defence' not right word. More like statement of 'for love of god, don't question them'.
@geoffrey_payne you'd be pleased to know I made a spirited defence of Army fixed-wing pilots this morning during a conversation
Don't worry, HARS Caribou. I still love you. 
Wiki says MRH90 can take a 4t underslung load - same payload as DHC4, except not restricted by cabin size.
Also omits transition from DHC4 to C27J - but in nutshell, greater range/cargo increase, and significantly less role overlap to Army's CH47F
Last stat omits B707 and KC30A - with the latter having delivered considerable increase in fuel/range/pax capacity in that class.
Following this morning's announcement, the RAAF will have nearly doubled its strategic airlift capacity in 10yrs 
@GlendonToews @Sandra_Sully @australian Rugby, too. Always been quietly curious about that, as they love other aspects of commonwealth.
But when PM @TonyAbbottMHR said to crowd that Benaud had passed (following C17A Announcement), there was a quite audible gasp.
Funny how news stories collide. Many at this morning's C17 Announcement at RAAF Amberley were already aware of Ritchie Benaud's passing.
@CateMc3273 (and apologies for bringing that Washpo story up - recognise you might be caught up with this morning's news)
@RadioFreeTom hey @CateMc3273 , did you see this piece?
@RadioFreeTom @eilperin i find the US Military is significantly lagging behind on this issue, in comparison to remainder of free world.
@nashvilledrones that was shot from a C130H, not C17A #pedantic
@Sigspace arguably, that comparison belongs to the B-Wing 
@casey_stedman @AthertonKD yerp yerp! #redsidewallseats
If X-Wings had bothered to complete their anti-TIE role, Y-Wings might actually have nailed Death Star on first run.
More so that A New Hope belies the SEAD role of the Y-Wing in the battle. What else did Lucas get wrong? 
When operating with augmented crew and comms, transports are also handy C2 assets 
Let's not forget, a transport had hand in destroying Second Death Star. 
I question whether Luke's X-Wing really destroyed the first Death Star. If war movies are any indication, a Y-Wing probably did it.
@jdcushman @ForcesReviewUK @GenMarkWelsh @starwars fighters make movies. Bombers make history.
@TheBaseLeg buying, yes. Not delivered
I would rate my @periscopeco experiment this morning as a mixed bag, but encouraging.

This is the LP2J Neptune modified with Skyhook. How cool is that! 
I really want to see an aviation print of the moment when this pig attacked the crew

@geoffrey_payne you're not a fan of the SR71?! Sir, I think you need to hand in your avgeek membership....
@geoffrey_payne different fuel used by SR71 necessitated its own KC135 variant with a separate fuel reserve.
@alert5 yeah just read through that. No direct answer on why they picked SR71 though?
@sabinewolff then how would I feel better about myself?
Anyone know origins of this shot? Possible KC747 vs KC10 competition? But why use SR71 for it (aside from awesome)? 
A small part of me regrets not having bought that SR71 Blackbird from newsagent last week

I'm not saying they should reach kids in school how to leave phone messages. But it would take, like, what...15min in a 11-13yr education?
@JeepCruzer not yet but seeing Miss Saigon is on my bucket list
South Vietnamese troops getting naked in street when North rolled into Saigon, so they wouldn't be ID'ed. Christ this is surreal.
@sabinewolff oh. OH. Ohhhhhhh....
@SharlynEgger @DrTimHuxley @SecurityScholar good stalking horse
@SharlynEgger @DrTimHuxley @SecurityScholar last thing they need is to support yet another platform. A F16 &amp; Su27/30/35 fleet is good fit
Chinook evacuation onto a moving ship. Holy. Shit.
I think I find embassy evacuations fascinating in general. Kabul '28; Saigon '75; Tehran '79; Phnom Penh '97
Oh crap that guy just wore a Huey in the neck
The courtyard that CH46 has landed in is T-I-N-Y 
@GI_Babette @FrudBezhan watched cricket but one the victory was more/less assured, switched over
But 40yrs after it happened, this story still speaks to me.
I don't mean to trivialise the collective tragedy of those affected by fall of Saigon for entertainment's sake.
Case in point 
How has nobody made like a really, really good movie about the Fall of Saigon? The scale of human condition here is amazing.
Radio signal for US Evac of Saigon was 'temperature will be 105 degrees and rising' followed by Bing Cosby 'Dreaming of a White Christmas'
Just switched over to cricket to see us win against Kiwis. Well fought, #Blackcaps. Well won, Aussies. Now back to Saigon.
Documentary is now raising evacuation options for Saigon. Fascinating. 
@GI_Babette My TV rarely comes off of SBS One and SBS2, unless something's on ABC/ABC2
Oh man State Department is starting to eat itself with the Vietnam evacuation. This is a pretty good doco.
@NZAircraftFan Devils you know, though? (And I'm sorry to keep using devil analogies!)
@NZAircraftFan yeah I know! That's the other fascinating thing. There's really not much moral high ground in this conflict.
@NZAircraftFan do we say that though with the benefit of hindsight though? Not antagonising you, but playing devils advocate.
@sabinewolff it has mid-70s Walter Cronkite
Fall of South Vietnam is one of those junctions of history I find fascinating
Watching Last Days of Saigon on @SBS.   Nudge me if the cricket gets better.
@sabinewolff also, a documentary on SBS about the fall of Saigon which starts RIGHT NOW 
@sabinewolff you know what is interesting? How they made the robots in Interstellar. 
@sabinewolff shit!
@sabinewolff we ate them all in Berry soz 
@sabinewolff I'm excited for anyone whose seen Top Gun but not The Final Countdowm
Omg how fun are weddings #playdarylbraithwraite
@sabinewolff or The Final Countdown 
#justsayin
@sabinewolff why do I feel you're as excited for #nswpol as you are for #TopGun <OLDER MAN>
@sabinewolff <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Viper drops how 10 of his mates died in his tour, like Maverick should be happy he only lost Goose. Damn babyboomers 
Cheap Trick's 'Mighty Wings' - probably my favourite song on the #TopGun soundtrack 
If you want to know who the pilots are in the bar scene: anyone with a moustache or who looks like your friends dad #TopGun
"Carnal knowledge of a lady - this time" holy shit Goose, "this time"? Who was he?! #TopGun 
"Switching to guns" frightening amount of dialogue from this movie is in my common lexicon #TopGun
@sabinewolff no, I pre-loaded tweets and didn't get chance to share them because I was driving
Holy shit, Mav! Care to maybe lower that fist there? That is NOT cool #TopGun 
As a young boy of 4, I never understood this gentleman's driving need for butts #TopGun 
Iceman is supposed to be this antagonist but all I've heard him do is talk sense and reason in #TopGun to Maverick. Look it up.
All of the CAG boss' lines are exposition. He does really well though, but nothing he says doesn't serve the plot #TopGun
Here are some #TopGun tweets I didn't get a chance to share last night because i was driving:
@DzirhanDefence thanks mate! Can't wait for next round match ups so I can use my powers for good. Or evil, either way. #TFC15
@AthertonKD thanks mate! Learned a lot from this experience. Some (hopefully good) changes in store for my Twitter.
@VealSlab @ShephardNews @Rotorfocus @livefist @MaxRotor my Air Force might not own those assets but so proud we took this shot
@kotzbear @hannahgais haaaa!
.@hannahgais it was my pleasure! Tortured, harrowing pleasure.
Oh Thank God! Well fought, @hannahgais, and well won! 
Just quietly, one negative gee on a MiG is pretty god damned useless #TopGun
I want to see a #TopGun fanfic about that whole Penny Benjamin debacle 
"Hey Mav, your old man died when you were a kid!" Wow such sensitive #TopGun 
Fun fact! US Navy at Top Gun in Miramar during mid 80s flew against actual MiG17s and MiG21s #TopGun
I always thought these guys expression was a bit weird. You're on an aircraft carrier. #TopGun 
I'd forgotten just how sweaty everyone is in this movie. Seriously, was there a kettle left running? #TopGun 
The guy with the first line in Top Gun has no line for the rest of the movie. Or role. #morningscott #TopGun 
Screen capped because I always run out of time reading it. #TopGun 
RIP Tony Scott #TopGun 
It begins! #TopGun 
@sabinewolff ya
And also I got to land on USS George Washington once and they gave me cake #TopGun 
So it's a good thing #TopGun was basically used to babysit me from ages 4-10yo.... 
In all likelihood, I'm going to miss most of #TopGun Internet Event, which starts in 7 minutes
I can't tweet along with Top Gun at 7pm AEDST tonight - so I'm preloading tweets now #TopGun 
Fred Durst coming out on the frontfoot on this Robert Durst thing is actually kind of funny....and tragic 
@ivanplis hey there, buddy. Get you anything? 
@MontanaGent @hannahgais hey, my half-arsed effort was still all mine! #TFC15
@MontanaGent in all honesty, I'm just honoured to have competed against some of these folks. For me and my country #Straya #TFC15
@MontanaGent @hannahgais but her Putin/Kim bad romance was pretty damned solid #TFC15
@MontanaGent go back through my timeline, I ran a Zero Dark 30 style raid on @hannahgais Compound of Sin<TRADE MARK SIGN> before dawn
@badnetworker Settlers of Catan: Insurgency Expansion. Pieces of your road are randomly taken off the board. #TFC15
Settlers of Crimea.
Settlers of the West Bank.
Seabasers of Catan.
Yep, I'd play those.
@CapnRaccoon @PatchKolan wait, on set or off set? And from accounts, the arsehole kind of came about when he left SNL
Or any spin off of Catan with geopolitical implications. There's so, so much potential #TFC15
Really wishing I'd pursued the idea of a Putin-theme Settlers of Catan spin-off harder today for #TFC15 against @hannahgais
Google doesn't need my blessing but I've legit used this on Twitter as a response to journos

I'll say this about my #TFC15 showdown against @hannahgais tomorrow - I'm planning to make it entertaining, &amp; I think she is too.
@vaughndavis heaps good!
I dont want to speculate on cause, but statistically speaking, flying an A320 is safer than &lt;INSERT MUNDANE ACTIVITY&gt; 
@ivanplis you're going to see @hannahgais &amp; I arguing a lot in the next day or so, &amp; I just want you to know, we both care about you deeply.
@ivanplis hey! What are you thinkin' about
@hannahgais this is about as close as I've come to those topics... 
@hannahgais Wow! I don't specialise in any of those. But totally use them! Even if I lose, I'm bound to learn something.
@sabinewolff I petted a falcon in Prague once.
@HayesBrown also, people are terrible if this what it takes for them to care about this issue.
@hannahgais we need a common ground to engage each other on sometimes (as well as uncommon ground). Suggestions? Topics?

Nope, @Superbowl2000 definitely stole my OpSlipper tweets. Hence why my Twitter ID is still in the pic URL. Weird!
If I didn't know better, I'd say @Superbowl2000 was standing right next to me yesterday. Or, he just stole all my Tweets.
I Googled 'unbuilt helicopters' to find cool artist impressions, came back with incomplete model kit pictures. Get it together, hobbyists!
@mickd1973 @lordbeariofbow Nobody disputes what sailors went through 70yrs ago - but sad to not acknowledge the work of recent generations
Q Will my #TFC15 campaign rely heavily on cheap use of Cold War era artists impressions?
A Why yes, I believe it will 
@TheBaseLeg @COMINT_AU @KyleMizokami I can't tell if they're just being polite when we show them our jet or not, but....
@COMINT_AU @TheBaseLeg @KyleMizokami ahhh I want to weigh in on this but don't know if it's my place to!
@RadioFreeTom agree. Too, too late. FOR YOU. 
@RadioFreeTom I want to see you bring it.
@Col1791 @derwoodau wilco tomorrow
WANT RT @DzirhanDefence: This more for you :D 
@Kudzu81 @RadioFreeTom now you're catching on!
My response to the One Day Cricket vs Test Match debate: 
@mrdavidboberesq here is a list of Kerry Packer quotes proving how egotistical/insane/awesome he was 
@davidglasson on that secret 8th day of the week we have in the Southern Hemisphere
@sabinewolff at the toy or that it's in Lindcraft or that I didn't buy it
I'm not going to lie. As an 8yo, I could have happily played with those Lego-knock offs in their intended theme/purpose.
For the child who craves to play out their own border security policy scenarios, look no further! 
@WendyfWilson will chase up tomorrow
Wandering Lindcraft w/ Chelle: 23 years on, kids can re-enact Op Desert Storm with off brand Lego. 
@derwoodau thanks, will put you in touch with him.
@derwoodau @Col1791 @WendyfWilson  any possibility you could send some of those pics to bloke who led the CBR C130J form?
So on 23MAR15 (24MAR15) the feed is going to get somewhat hectic as #TFC15 gets underway. 
@laurenist @trnels @ejschaef BYO Velcro
But I'm not all shrimp-on-BBQs &amp; crocodile hunting. I promise to be international in my approach to #TFC15 references 
Shhh RT @marhalimabas: @eamonhamilton You eat lions also?
But we're also the only country to eat animals from our Coat of Arms (except the magpie &amp; swan, because, eugh) #TFC15 
Yes, my country fought (&amp; lost) a war against Emus 
For the unitiated, a Quokka is what a small wallaby would like like if it was created by Jim Henson #TFC15 
But I'll be the only #TFC15 contender who can promise you quokkas, the world's cutest marsupial 
Any of my #TFC15 opponents can promise you one of these 
...but we also brought the world these #TFC15  #yourewelcome 
Yes, Australia sent this out into the world... #TFC15 
Before we begin #TFC15, I want to address a few issues that will no doubt be raised by my opponents....
Much like International Rescue from 'Thunderbirds', we launch from an island in Pacific in times of danger #TFC15 
My job is to manage media/comms for Air Mobility Group, our Air Force's arm for transport as tanking #TFC15 
To the #TFC15 Groupies, this is my 'to be read' pile. Not pictured: Kindle App. 
When in reality, I'm more like "Why is this technician smiling? The answer (and moustache) may surprise you." #TFC15 
I do media for our Air Force, which most of you probably think is all like this (flag aside)... #TFC15 
Now I'd like to share some messages with the #TFC15 fan base. 
How did I get nominated for #TFC15? I don't know, but I expect some major revelation in its third act. 
....but fought along the lines of International Relations, Defence and other driving issues. #TFC15
It's basically an international competition that is equal parts Rap Battle, Meme War, and Debate.... #TFC15
...or send you searching for a 'mute' in your Twitter app. So, go either way #TFC15 
For the uninitiated, #TFC15 is liable to provide you great entertainment.... 
Attention followers: I have been drafted into Twitter Fight Club 2015 (#TFC15) which gets underway this week 
@Airminded this would be a good time to mute me - but I'm changing up my Twitter account in next month or so.
Straw poll for followers: are you across this Twitter Fight Club business? 
@sabinewolff for like, a month. Long enough to enjoy it, short enough not to be jaded by it.
@sabinewolff well whose fault is that
@PeterDoherty7 thanks for posting this up.
Or applauding from the footpath
Remember these Aussies today
#OpSLIPPER 
I made the #TFC15 bracket. You know who else was dangerously under-qualified for this job? That's right. 
@texasinafrica I like to look at it as being 17 hours ahead of the game (19hrs, Pacific time) #TFC15
@lordbeariofbow @Australian_Navy you know, anyone else would have looked at that photo &amp; recognised hard work &amp; sacrifice these sailors made
@TheBaseLeg @AsiaJetWatch proton not photon *screeching blackboard*
Great photo from @Australian_Navy of @Aus_AirForce C130J over Melbourne for #OpSLIPPER parade 
oh no, we really don't...! RT @TheBaseLeg: @eamonhamilton seriously, 37 Sqn needs to do this more often. Specifically, over Melbourne
Well we managed to impress Dad

That moment I realised I was dressed just like the staff at @BavarianBierCaf 
@sabinewolff or Bavarian bier cafe on york st. Also good.
@sabinewolff come to Hobbyco!
@estherswchan go for it.
@TheBaseLeg oh Hercules....
@caidid wait just found the rules and remember @drunkenpredator doing this last year. Think I've got the hang of it.

At Pool of Remembrance in Hyde Park Sydney for today's #OpSLIPPER memorial 
@texasinafrica sure! Why not.
@sabinewolff 1. Go to Hobbyco. 2. Buy a model plane. 3. Fly model plane around hotel room. Questions/Comments
@geoffrey_payne no problem whatsoever. I appreciated the Army contingent, esp. in light of those army members who could not march today.
@sabinewolff also, weather <UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️
@sabinewolff k. I'm like a block away but have to follow the parade. Will let you know if I'm free.

How lame is #RedDawn2012? It opens with Gridiron. 
@Airminded @sabinewolff WAY better-er
Oh God we're at *this* part of #RedDawn I don't have the moral fortitude right now for this g'night errybody! 
I'm at the part of #RedDawn where sound editor is just playing gunfire effects regardless of action. Think it might be bedtime...
#RedDawn and #Octopussy are the only movies the F111 made it into. Meanwhile, the C130 has been in, like, a billion 
Oh silly Forger, what are you doing all the way in Colorado? #RedDawn 
Apparently you can watch #RedDawn (2012) on YouTube. Free. You bet your ass you should buy #RedDawn (1984) on DVD. 
I reckon I've met enough USAF pers to buy #PowersBoothe as an F15 pilot in #RedDawn 
So many of my problems as a kid, I wish were solved with #PowersBoothe parachuting from a dogfight #RedDawn 
Fun #RedDawn fact! Guy on right is totally the chess master 'Kronstein' in #FromRussiaWithLove 
All action movie montages should have Jennifer Grey running a HMG #RedDawn 
#Wolverines #RedDawn 
@ValerioMBonelli both are fictional
Daryl's dad in #RedDawn totally sells Bernie Mac a van in #oceanseleven, 17yrs later 
We're 6wks into the invasion and Sheen's still wearing the high school jacket. Let it go, dude #RedDawn 
Ok, I just searched the hashtag #RedDawn and, uh, yeah. We need to take it back. Lotta crazies.
In fairness to this guy's gross mis-translation, I've done this to Chelle on holiday, like, dozens of times #RedDawn 
My brat-pack reading on this movie is at five.  #RedDawn
@ValerioMBonelli so was Thunderbird 2 :-/
We never see the horses in this scene again. So yeah, horse steaks? #RedDawn 
Media tropes that I'd forgotten were grounded in an actual movie #RedDawn 
The pacing of this movie is insanely quick. 24min and we're already in the camps. #RedDawn 
@Airminded Top Gun in German is AWESOME @sabinewolff
"I got me a Chrysler, it seats about 20, so hurry up and bring your juke box money!" #RedDawn 
Wait, so what's going on in Afghanistan in the #RedDawn -verse? 
I like how #RedDawn is basically #NRA fanfic, but you know, not patronisingly so.
One of the Wolverines is wearing a StarWars hat. OMG I CAN RELATE #RedDawn
Fun fact: Bloke on right plays a Cuban Colonel in #RedDawn, USS Nimitz XO in Final Countdown 
Call me crazy, but *I'd* be pretty honoured to piss in Patrick Swayze's radiator in an emergency #RedDawn 
This #RedDawn clip needs no commentary #NRA #ZombieApocalypse 
I haven't seen the new #RedDawn but I assume Id care more in first 2min of this movie than 2hrs of remake.
This guy's mission brief: 1. Parachute into Colorado. 2. Waste a brown Pontiac sedan. 3. Mission accomplish #RedDawn 
YEP RT @TheBaseLeg: @eamonhamilton with each movie set in the same time period, but focusing on a different town/city
Holy crap I feel like I should play this movie at 1/4 speed there's so much goodness #RedDawn
"I played Mr Tisdale in #RedDawn". This actor will never have to buy a drink at the bar again. 
We're 4min in and already the invasions started. Solid. #RedDawn 
Seriously, why couldn't they just make new #RedDawn movies every year in the 80s with a new bunch of teens ala Nightmare on Elm St
@derwoodau @ValerioMBonelli sorry, my brain autocorrects 'tanks' to 'targets'
Someday I'll watch #RedDawn in German. But not today. 
@sabinewolff ok we might be able to syncro. I might live tweet first 20min of 'Red Dawn' in a minute.
@sabinewolff was going to be 'The Last Starfighter' but only so much of that movie I can take in a week. Suggestions?
Debating the relative merits of live tweeting a movie tonight, but think I'll pass. Big day tomorrow.

@lenadunham you're a monster! A hilarious, correct monster.
Just 2 mates hanging out. HMAS Rankin with USS Alberquerque off WA coast 
Coming up next: how many left handed Ewoks were there (actually that seems answerable)
Statistically speaking, a good percentage of the Empire would have had to have been LGBTQI. So, like, just pick every 15th or so guy.
@TheBaseLeg could make no guarantees on imagery for you
Funnier still when you consider how much of cast was gay.
Couldn't they have at least retconned one of the Xwing pilots, or even some Star Destroyer tech? Something's better than nothing.
Surely Star Wars isn't only just getting its first LGBTQI character now. I mean, C3PO? And even that's a stretch.
Sorry, 'wild' garlic. You just can't guarantee the stability in a that I need pesto sauce tonight. 
@GQuattromani cheers mate! They even used footage of an older Hercules model that deserved recognition for AFG. Very happy with result.
@TheFeedSBS @marcfennell very meta!
@sabinewolff then you'll see a four-ship. Followed an hour later by an eight-ship.
@sabinewolff just a dawned on me that we are sending a 2-ship over Melbourne on 21MAR15. More fool me!
As sick as I was on the Hercules today....how honestly awesome does the news footage look of them going over Russell. AIRPOWER!
Oh my God. I think I vomited a few ribs during that flight.

*Until directed otherwise.
@JohnBirmingham is there a particular naming convention for demons/monsters/dragons, or whatever sounds cool? I'm asking...for a friend.
@Gavin_Simon @JDKightly @errolwi Yes. From the trade visitors. Precious few families visiting on public days buy a $180m airlifter.

Agreed. This is why I hate #QandA. RT @nprmonkeysee: Dear @Twitter: please, please let me mute hashtags, not just people.
@macilree when I was little, dad had a C130 book that included photos of a RC model that had an amphibious hull.
@TheBaseLeg 1 C130J I flew on at Red Flag had a broken aircon (fixed overnight - BZ techos!). So, not so silly an #AvalonQs
Watch this @Aus_AirForce #Avalon15 summary video, if for no other reason than it has sweet GoPro &amp; nice transitions 
@nbcsnl Great episode on Saturday!
Hi, I'm from the Bronx, &amp; I fly to the edge of space for a living Rt @sabinewolff: this woman is a deadset boss 
Pardon the humblebrag, but it's @WomenOfAviation week, &amp; RAAF Middle East airlift commander is our very own Stalks 
@maelorin all the more impetus for me to talk about who/what our organisation does for a living!
@zerogeewhiz @sabinewolff A handful of people, but too many nonetheless. Especially when they're asking a female RAAF pilot.
There's also @WomenOfAviation, who we're doing some work with ATM
There's also some awesome Twitter accounts re: Women in Aviation (literally @WomenInAviation) and @WomenMilAv8rs
Whatever your interest in aviation is, for the love of God, don't assume that its community should rest on gender alone.
@sabinewolff I like the way you think
Last tweet is as good as any to segue into fact that 2-8MAR15 is Women in Aviation Week - 
Alarming number of people asking whether women could be pilots, including from women #AvalonQs
I also like "What can it carry?" and "Can it carry x?". Again, people got their life back after 30min. #AvalonQs
@marhalimabas Admittedly, it didn't get above 30C. I recall this being a milder Avalon for weather. @thebaseleg @nigelpittaway thoughts?
My favourite #AvalonQs however is "What is this?". I pity the people who asked me - 30min later, they got their life back! #notsorry
Best #AvalonQs was "Do you fly with the airconditioning cart still attach" at C130J.
"This is where the pressurisation in the C130J cargo stops" - not a Q, but statement from industry rep. It was an arbitrary point in cargo.
"Do the C17A engines stop and reverse when it thrust reverses" #AvalonQs
(I may have assumed this until an embarrassingly old age)
@marhalimabas Every season conceivable.
"Do the strakes on KC30A flaps keep it straight if it lands on water?" #AvalonQs (seemingly a lot of interest in waterlandings :-/ )
"Can the Hercules float in water?" #AvalonQs
"Do you fly with the merchandise table set up?" #AvalonQs 
(Funnily enough: 36SQN C130Hs did exactly this during 1989 Pilots Strike)
"How many eggs can this hold?" #AvalonQs.
We do get asked a lot of odd questions though. C130J folks cop some of the best. "Is this a model?" asked at 2013 (plus CMA2014).
Seriously, RAAF have brought a C17A to the last 5 Avalons - and people still ask us if it's really ours! 
Great to see the public getting to see inside RAAF C17A &amp; C130J, and up close to KC30A. Get ready for a C27J in 2017 
Seriously, the @AustralianArmy Tiger ARH is welcome at any air show I go to now. Can not love that helicopter any more than I do.
My favourite part about #Avalon15 though? The ADF Air Spectacular. Going in, I was afraid I was overselling it to people.
Currently in #Avalon15 recovery mode, and pre-preparation for whatever is coming next.
@DerekSheen @pattonoswalt Oh god yes. People found opinions on Twitter to support an angle on a non-story. Also, @TaranKillam nailed it.
Today I learned that the backs of my eyes look pretty veiny and gross but that an eyetest is a fun way to spend a Monday morning. 7/10.
@LukePrestonInk how does babysitting hold up
@VirginAustralia I'm pretty happy with the peroni just quietly
@VirginAustralia you had me with the nacho bar.
Oh God. Does the @VirginAustralia Lounge Melbourne do weddings?
As did I (I think). Thanks! RT @sabinewolff: Today I successfully avoided airshow sunburn...except for a little patch at the end of my nose.
Damnit! Opportunity missed. RT @RhiannaPatrick: The C-17 and me #avselfie #avgeek #avalon15 #avalon2015 #abcrhi 
They call him 'Mr X'. But mostly because his first name's Xavier. RAAF C130J Loadmaster interviewed with @krock955 
No joke, @Avalon2015 CEO Ian Honnery held a door open for me and a bunch of other folks at #Avalon15 today.

@sabinewolff come down to the KC30!
@TheBaseLeg @adammudhen I don't know what you're talking about
Everyone's happy to see the RAAF C17A at #Avalon15. And the C17A is happy to see everyone 
Every RAAF C130J Hercules flyover at #Avalon15 needs the Dambusters theme 
RAAF imagery of the KC-30A doing its thang at #Avalon15 
I have so much love for what's in this pic RT @RhiannaPatrick: The C17 over the KC30 &amp; FA18s in distance #avalon15 
@CanvasWings @RhiannaPatrick oh it did go! Was rather hoping it had changes its mind and was staying
Literally no other #avgeek will understand this RT @RhiannaPatrick: This demo team play that song from Step Up 3
RAAF C17A accomplishment unlocked RT @sabinewolff: here I am exiting a large plane 
Hey errybody the King Airs are here! 
VIDEO: @AddLibbi from @studio10au checks out the RAAF C130J at #Avalon15 
It's been my observation during this airshow that birds have little-to-no regard for correct air traffic control procedures
3 RAAF C130Js conduct their paradrop and flypast at #Avalon15

RAAF and JASDF Tanker Delegations engage in 'Drum Off' at #Avalon15 
@adammudhen "I think there's a problem with the toilet in the back of your helicopter."
"We don't have a toilet in the helicopter."
Damnit peer pressure, you're not helping RT @Lobes: sunglasses at night dude, its friday night you wanna be a cool kid or not?
Sounds like the intro to an Air Crash Investigations RT @adammudhen: @eamonhamilton try squinting while you drive, works for me !
@sabinewolff not to sound too down, but I saw it two years ago, &amp; exit traffic will be nightmare without it
Leaning toward option B at the moment.
Conundrum: Ive lost my glasses. Do I stay for night-time spectacular &amp; limp home, or leave before sundown with my prescription sunnies?
Damn this is a good C17A display
Bittersweet end to the ADF Aerial Spectacular: I lost my glasses :-/
This is us totally landing a pair of C130Js simultaneously 
This is us totally landing 2 C130Js simultaneously 
FLTLT Warwick Jones you are nailing the commentary! 
HEY EVERYBODY WATCH THE 2 C130Js ABOUT TO LAND FROM THE NORTH
Super Hornet, and more splosions 
C17A hauling outta Avalon 
...or the Roulettes in the backs of MGs in the warzone
Hahaha I don't know what's funnier - the Tigers dogfighting the birds out to the West....
12 Rolls Royce turboprops in close formation. I love it. 
Tigers, Globemaster, Bushmasters, oh my! 
Hi, I'm the C17A, and I can bring you 70t of stuff. 
Who invited this guy?! 
Tiger ARHs just daring the #Avalon15 crowd to come at them, bro 
Army's Red Berets parachute display team landing. So glad they decided to 'drop in' 
You'll never believe what these RAAF Hercules airdrop until you watch this video #Clickbait 
Yeah! Hercules paradrop was to 'Blue Monday' by New Order!
KC30A &amp; Super Hornets: Mother w/ chicks in tow 
Oh no you didn't, AP3C! #splosions 
Now there's an AP3C here. I'd sure hate to be a submarine around here at the moment 
In the time it took this Wedgetail to do its flypast, it just scanned like a gazillion square kilometres of airspace 
RAAF Super Hornets getting their dogfight on at #Avalon15 
@sabinewolff where you watching the spectacular from?
ADF Aerial Spectacular is about to get underway #Avalon15
@sabinewolff ahhh! Did they let you up to the cockpit?

R1 parking, I love you #Avalon15
@stock_jaryd it's a quality of commentator that I fear we lack here
@eamonhamilton: 36SQN and the C17A cargo bay at #Avalon15. To the right: my big butt. 
@TheBaseLeg yeah!
If my KC30A is going to refuel Singaporean jets this year, then I demand the Black Knights commentator be a part of it. #Avalon15
The Singaporean Black Knights 2-ship F-16 routine finishes with Katy Perry's 'Firework'. Love it. #Avalon15
Thanks @shaundesq - RAAF C130J 3-ship this afternoon at #Avalon15 
I'd totally show you my photos from the RAAF C130J display today, but I was using my grown up camera. Soz. #avalon15
Meanwhile, in Darwin: RAAF C17A delivers shelters for cyclone-affected communities 
Folks, the Caribou just arrived at #Avalon15. This airshow is now officially a party. 
Good news! I found someone to run up &amp; down the #Avalon15 flightline all day for me. Now to put a GoPro on his collar 
Hey everyone, the HARS Catalina just arrived. Everyone look busy. #Avalon15
"I'M A KC30A, FEED ME PALLETS AND LUGGAGE CONTAINERS OMNOMNOMNOM." #Avalon15 
Works for Hillary RT @warp975: @eamonhamilton new definition of open plan office..? 
@TheBaseLeg didn't think it was going to NZ - wasn't on their map yesterday?
Very happy to be stuck in here for the next little while! #Avalon15 
@sabinewolff outstanding.
@RAFNewsReporter (on the VC10....obviously)
@AirbusDS hey @RAFNewsReporter I spoke to Ian Elliot from Airbus - he was the navigator in this photo! 
@sabinewolff I simply must get you to see the KC30A and C17A. And the C130J too.
Can't decide my favourite part about A400M tour yesterday. The A400M, or hearing VC10 warries from Ian Elliot of @AirbusDS
More RAAF #Avalon15 Imagery - I'm assured the C17A Globemaster display is fantastic. 
Great imagery from the RAAF Media Team here at #Avalon15 - here's the KC-30A MRTT display 
Today's drive to #Avalon15 brought to you by the Zero Dark Thirty soundtrack
@Hush_Kit @edwardwarddraws see Sea Mosquito; rubber landing deck. In fact, see most of Winkle Brown's test career
@falcon124 just caught up for beers with a good mate of mine who works for him!
@davidglasson awwww, yeah? Meet at the C130J tomorrow around 11ish?
Ergonomics for cockpit, and crew SA, looked very impressive.
Felt weird not walking into cockpit of A400M through centre/lefthand side (like every other large aircraft). A400M cockpit entry is on right
Took a whole bunch of photos of A400M today but they're largely on my not-phone. Came away pretty impressed.
@COMINT_AU theatre callsigns often different to home
I don't like R3 carpark &gt;:-( #avalon15
Generations of aircrew have banged their head inside aircraft. The A400M will end that now. 
Mon dieu! 
AIRCDRE McDonald now in QandA (no, not that QandA) with @AirbusDS at #Avalon15 
AIRCDRE McDonald: KC30A has great future ahead of it; considerable role expansion possible under #PlanJericho
AIRCDRE McDonald: Last remaining KC30A - ironically, Aircraft -001 - has arrived in Australia. 
AIRCDRE McDonald: All 5 KC30As now received in Australia
AIRCDRE McDonald: F35 refuel trials to begin this year too in United States 
AIRCDRE McDonald: RAAF will then engage Singapore to refuel with F15 and F16s 
AIRCDRE McDonald: first boom refuel will be other KC30; then E7A Wedgetail 
AIRCDRE McDonald: coalition aircraft over Iraq "come looking for us" for fuel
AIRCDRE McDonald: coalition aircrew listen for our callsign "Scorch": "We are the tanker of choice". 
AIRCDRE McDonald: currently in mod program for boom; airworthiness board in March will see RAAF commence booming 
AIRCDRE McDonald: Boom in 2014 test flights operated exceptionally well. 
AIRCDRE McDonald: '14 saw KC30 go from category 1 hose/drogue clearance to full clearance. Drogue performs flawlessly 
AIRCDRE McDonald: project availability taken over operational availability in 2014; inverse will occur in 2015.
AIRCDRE McDonald: not being a lead customer on project like this leaves engineer without problem-solving skillsets
AIRCDRE McDonald: we've gone from 2100 flying hours (annual); now we'll be pushing 4500 flying hours
AIRCDRE McDonald: 2014, "we realised we needed to move out of the transition period...lets get out and use it." 
AIRCDRE McDonald: KC30A has been a game changer, for strat airlift and for air to air refuelling 
AIRCDRE McDonald: KC30A is 'fundamental' for RAAF 
Commander Air Mobility Group, Air Commodore Warren McDonald, to deliver RAAF KC30A brief to media #Avalon15 
@alert5 @NigelPittaway1 probably!
Christian Scherer with @AirbusDS gets #Avalon15 brief underway 
Anyone up for some movies (or streamed feeds) in the back of the RAAF Hercules? #Avalon15 
The RAAF C17A toys are typically handed out to very special kids: hospital visits, children of some deployed members, etc.
How exclusive are these RAAF C17 toys? I'm the AMG PR guy and even *I* don't have one. 
@adammudhen @RhiannaPatrick don't think they are unfortunately
@sabinewolff you need to be at Avalon today, asking questions and running interference whilst I oceans-11 myself some sweet display models
@alert5 ha! Stand by for an update on this (the next time I get out to the flightline)
View from the RAAF KC30 stairs: Japanese KC767 and taiko drummers at #Avalon15 
My #avgeek for #Avalon15: We have SATCOM on RAAF C130J Hercules! Sign of current capability increase &amp; what's to come 
@JohnBirmingham I need to get off my arse and write the fanfic I planned for this!
Panoramic view from the right-hand seat of the RAAF C17A at #Avalon15 
There's a lot to like about this #avalon15 flightline! 
C17 engines have intestines. How about that. #Avalon15 
Let's all hope these lads can resolve their disagreement with counselled conflict resolution #Avalon15 
I don't want to alarm anyone, but it would appear a dogfight has broken out at #Avalon15

@GarethJennings3 Whaaaat!
@TheBaseLeg @DrTimHuxley also, if you've got the flying hours, you might as well fly 'em
@TheBaseLeg @DrTimHuxley Agreed - suspect it's more for the home audience than anyone else's sake
@AeroAustralia twice?!?!
New hotel room tomorrow! No more living like the ugnaughts in Cloud City 
Set aside 10min to watch this fantastic @RoyalAirForceUK reel from early 50s (HT @RAFNewsReporter, c/o @Airboyd )

@RAFNewsReporter Hey @shaundesq you need to see/hear/experience this video
@RAFNewsReporter Just started watching, can I buy this soundtrack from iTunes? Shazaaming it now...
@GQuattromani Sure thing.
@GQuattromani maybe. Why?
In 1997, 13yo Dave Whyte saw the @usairforce C17 at #Avalon. In 2015, he's flying the @Aus_AirForce C17A display 
If you love Science &amp; Gelato, then I recommend 'The Lab' on Bourke St in Melbourne 
"But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle had finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Melbourne Trams."
Why was I looking up Big Brother on Amazon again? Oh right.
INGSOC definitely using the soft touch with this 'Big Brother' infant wear on Amazon 
I forgot: follow @WendyfWilson and @stevenpam for more #Avalon15 action. I'll remember/get reminded of others.
Worimi Hornet even bears WOFF Len Waters name - fitting recognition for a WW2 RAAF icon 
VIDEO: I could never love a Hornet more than a Trashauler, but the Worimi Hornet looks so, so, so very awesome 
There's also @katey_kennedy, I'll see if I can hassle her into posting more avalon stuff tomorrow. Tho she was super busy today
(Obvs same for @COMINT_AU, @CanvasWings, @TheBaseLeg, @GarethJennings3, @pcdu crew, anyone else who chest pokes me for not listing them)
Just come to my attention that @NigelPittaway1 has only 412 followers. If you want to see some good stuff from #Avalon15, follow him!
@jonoabroad A lot of families have had a ride in one, often not under the best of circumstances. But agreed.
(Not to mention organisational/personnel changes, and effect that other new RAAF capabilities will have on the air mobility fleet!)
#PlanJericho more exciting for Air Mobility Group when you consider growth potential of existing new technologies like Link16 &amp; SATCOM
For Air Mobility Group, #PlanJericho is exciting - considerable capability growth for our existing fleet and incoming C-27J Spartans
#PlanJericho will see the RAAF capitalise on new technology for its existing and incoming platforms - see Video at 
RAAF C17A Globemaster air-to-airs from #PlanJericho shoot 
RAAF KC30A MRTT air-to-airs from #PlanJericho shoot 
RAAF C130J Hercules air-to-airs from the #PlanJericho shoot 
Seriously, these photos are so god damned handsome #PlanJericho
So, last month whilst I was at Red Flag, I missed out on an RAAF air-to-air shoot for #PlanJericho. Want to see the product from that shoot?
RAAF pics of Singaporean 'Black Knights' F-16s over Canberra 
@GarethJennings3 thank you for dropping your card off to me! I should be around the afternoon in media centre (RAAF side or civilian)
The refueller station in the JASDF KC767. Handy access to the galley on the far wall! 
Next #avalon I'm getting a border collie with a live-streaming GoPro on its collar. Will be far easier than walking up &amp; down the flightline
First #avalon15 morning is down. If anyone notices a burning smell, that would be my hair.
@alert5 @LockheedMartin de-icing boot on all C130Js
Now this, I'm particularly excited about. @LockheedMartin MC-130J-30 Hercules in RAAF markings at #Avalon15 
@DzirhanDefence my understanding is that MY is ill-suited to tank warfare.
Your tank delivered anywhere in Oz, or your pizza's free! RAAF C17A brings M1A1 to #Avalon15 
@murphavfc @RAeSTimR Still sound sweet when they buzz over my head 2x4 (or 3x4 as the case will be later this week)
@RAeSTimR Well they're Rolls Royce either way!
@RAeSTimR Reminds of time I shared a C130J side-wall seat with a former Lancaster dorsal turret gunner. His view 70yrs ago was much better
@RAeSTimR original copy was written on unused sick bags (and significantly longer!)

1st RAAF pilot to fly the EA18G Growler at #RedFlag speaks to RAAF News 
Awkward realisation. What if I'm the one dressed crazy on this tram.
Nobody is dressed crazy on this tram. But we've not made Swanston St yet #stillhope
First tram ride of this trip to #Avalon15. Years ago I would have mocked these electrified-trolley buses and walked. More fool me.
Lead sentences don't get much better than this (C/O @austdefence @KZiesing) 
Hey @COMINT_AU , your mate? 
Spent the afternoon standing at the @LockheedMartin #Avalon15 stand eating a cream cheese bagel whilst 'Moonriver' played.
Check out the 8-pages of #RedFlag coverage in the latest RAAF News @Aus_AirForce @NellisAFB 
@TheBaseLeg hahaha it's like 19C and you're suggesting Speedos. Mike you have gone full Melbourne on me.
My meteorological understanding is that this weather usually precipitates a T Rex attack #hecantsreusifwedontmove 
@WendyfWilson @TheBaseLeg I've just made it to the turn off from Pousties Road into the site.
@Esquiremag more tweets like this please, Esquire
@WendyfWilson @TheBaseLeg I'd stick my hand out to wave to you, but....yeah! #waiting
@adammudhen @TheBaseLeg glass houses!
Finding myself dressing for comfort more and more each Avalon airshow. Don't surprised if I'm wearing a onesie come 2017.
@TheDaveSinclair so meta
@senorschubert i think you may be right!
@TheDaveSinclair I hope the ISS needs their spacesuits ironed, because I'm eminently qualified to work in confined spaces
It'll be great for ironing 4 inches of my clothes at a time
Past Eamon: The hotel will totally have an ironing board!
Present Eamon: &gt;:-( 
@navybook @AaronMehta oh!
@navybook well technically some of  @AaronMehta pics are exclusive. Will hopefully show him through KC30 this week at #Avalon15
@navybook (they're essentially the same tho :-P )
@eamonhamilton @navybook sure thing!
Not very exclusive at all - RAAF took the same pics RT @defense_news: Exclusive Photos: Global Hawk Arrives at Avalon 
The Global Hawk at #Avalon15? The Real McCoy. 
Ready to get my Avalon-ON
@RAFNewsReporter I'm partial to 50 shades - see attached 
@senorschubert upside down tho :-\
@AFGSC_CC I was with RAAF Det for RED FLAG 15-1 at @NellisAFB. Everytime I saw the B2A, I stopped what I was doing and watched.
This one wins the Russian escort contest RT @Elwick70: .@john_bartrop: One of the more unusual escorts..? 
@stevevisscher there's really only one winner this year - The Tele's coverage of the Iraq deployment
@GarethJennings3 I'll be in RAAF media centre for most part...which is usually a annex to main media centre
@sabinewolff I hope there's a Grill'd van again! Oh man that was the best
@GarethJennings3 @Avalon2015 yeah! How do I find you?
Me in 2011: I don't care if it's shot in SD or HD, so long as we get the clip!
Me in 2015: What the hell did they shoot this on, wax paper?
I'll be in Melbourne next week! Sunday-to-Sunday. 
@csimps0n Oh! *checks TV Guide*...damnit.
@mgerrydoyle @av8ok @TheBaseLeg @RAeSTimR the JASDF would hasten to disagree
I've come close to unfollowing @australian on several occasions. Their last MH17 post cinches it.
Correction to last: Sean Bean's quite underrated as a Bond villain.
Sean Bean's good too, I guess.
Although Gary Oldman playing 006 in Goldeneye would have been AWESOME.
Come to think of it, I don't think the world will ever need that Bond movie
That said, I dont think the world was ready in 1995 for a Besson-directed Bond movie where Bond girl is a 12yo orphan who 007 has to train
They even got Tcheky Karyo to play the Russian Defence Minister. They couldnt have been clearer.
Can't help but feel Eric Serra scoring 'Goldeneye' was Bond producers' way of hoping Luc Besson would direct the movie.
@BlueAngels @MarkHamilton73 "G'Day Mates!" Damnit, don't say that! For a minute I thought you were in Oz!
Stunning gallery of RAAF KC30A w/ Hornet and Growler at #CopeNorth15 in Guam 
TEASER: RAAF C130J Hercules practice for their #Avalon15 air display next week 
In January, RAAF KC30A flew 1 sortie/day for Op OKRA (often 2), w/ average sortie offloading 100k lbs fuel over 8.9hr 
Handy: The Air Task Group page for Operation OKRA in Iraq has monthly stats for fuel, sorties, &amp; hours flown 
@csimps0n DM sent yesterday w/ my email - Im in office today/tomorrow, but down at Avalon from Monday. Busy preparing good vision ATM
HOW did I miss the fact Aviation Historian had a god damned Blackburn Beverley on its front cover a few issues back? 
Great highlights video of 2014 @AATTC_STJO Airlift Tactics Course with USAF/USMC C130s and RAAF C17A. 
@adammudhen well that was justified (within reason!)
@TheBaseLeg @COMINT_AU Yep. Some in comments for @AusAviation too.
@COMINT_AU I did a scan of the official FB page. It's surprisingly enthusiastic in parts, but pessimists never cease to amaze.
In other breaking news, how good is life? 
Im disappointed like anyone else that it wont be flying, but the degree of vitriol directed at this airshow never ceases to amaze me.
If you want an insight into 'First World Avgeek Entitlement', go read comments about the F22 Raptor not doing an air display at #Avalon2015
@csimps0n @GizmodoAU Am sending the Photog heads up of the coverage. Let me know if you want any more RAAF stories (Avalon Air Show next wk)
@csimps0n @GizmodoAU I am air-punching so much right now.
@PacificCommand FYI, RAAF Twitter now on @Aus_AirForce (changed over late last year)
RAAF C130J, KC30A, and FA18As arrive in Guam for Ex #COPENORTH 15 
A @374AirliftWing C130H Hercules from Yokota AFB meets its future - a C130J (from RAAF) at Ex #COPENORTH 15 in Guam 
Chuffed by circulation this pic is getting on Twitter - very proud of RAAF Photog who took it. 
@MarcusReports @PilotB2 this is a RAAF photo and I am so god damned happy/proud of the sharing it's been getting!
This is a RAAF photo! And I campaigned to get it released! RT @livefist: Too much awesomeness in one frame. 
@sabinewolff It's people like you banning idiots that makes me feel better about banning idiots.
@sabinewolff Sorry to say he used to work with me - but I have no clue who he is.
@sabinewolff Solid.
Oh! Louis Jourdan, the villain from Octopussy, passed away. Another piece of my childhood.... 
@sabinewolff It needs to be down and locked though.
@sabinewolff My favourite episodes are the ones where the pilot is the nephew of the airline CEO
That's a wrap - Last selection of shots of RAAF C130J at #RedFlag @NellisAFB @Aus_AirForce 
@sabinewolff I like to imagine that when they're not at air shows, the flight crew for the Fat Albert C130 solve mysteries ALA Scooby Doo
@sabinewolff follow the members of the Blue Angels too
@COMINT_AU even *I'm* thinking of getting my camera and your lens out for it.
@RAFNewsReporter @IanDProctor yes please!
@errolwi I guess using @Avalon2015 works well enough
Also, what Hashtag are we using for Avalon?
For everyone who'll get to see the ADF air display at #AvalonAirShow next week - I'm just a little bit excited for you.
@RAFNewsReporter just leave the Mustang by the RAAF hangar for us to ferry home then yeah?
@jasminchill Link?

@alert5 @DaveMajumdar nah it's cool mate
@sabinewolff ok. Well, look me up. Backstage pass is like any other QANTAS A330, but significantly more AAR capability.
Ever wonder what #RedFlag looks like through NVGs? Wonder no more @NellisAFB @Aus_AirForce 
@alert5 @DaveMajumdar that's been my view from the office for like a month now :-P
@schlep_star @DrYobbo @Aus_AirForce neg
@sabinewolff so, see you at the kc30 at avalon in a week or two?
@sabinewolff tah!
The @Aus_AirForce KC30A MRTT is the Coalition tanker of choice over Iraq. Here's the proof. 
Sit in MiG29: [tick] 
@RAFNewsReporter It'd only replace something useful
Ever ponder what an @Aus_AirForce AP3C Orion brake change looks like? Wonder no more #RedFlag 
The @RoyalAirForceUK Sentinel surveillance aircraft at #RedFlag. It does....something. 
The @Aus_AirForce Hercules going off 2-by-2 (Hurrah!) for Exercise #RedFlag @NellisAFB 
An @Aus_AirForce C130J Hercules with @usairforce HC130J at #RedFlag 
Much going on in this photo at #RedFlag that I like @PilotB2 @RoyalAirForceUK @NellisAFB 
One of the highlights of coming to Nellis, the Threat Training Facility. No, SGT, you may not bring it home with you. 
We brought out our meanest nose art along for #RedFlag @Aus_AirForce @NellisAFB 
@ghweldon whose 2015 pick was this?
@COMINT_AU Such are the mysteries of a WereOrion.
It's been 2wks and I still haven't gotten tired of this sight #RedFlag 
Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of an Orion in the light of a full moon! #RedFlag 
Avalon Air Show's ADF air display won't be your grandfather's handling display. 
@Airheadsfly maybe, but low power settings in circuit I've found it significantly less noisy than F15/16/18.
@Waddowarthog ha! Right.
And 10. The imagery. More to come today. 
9. The USAF PAO team from @NellisAFB. I think they finally understand what I'm saying.
8. The Thunderbird Museum.
7. The B2A Spirit.
6. All of the other cool stuff at Nellis that is not #RedFlag, but look at anyway. Like the F35 (which is crazy quiet).
5. Using the toilet in another RAAF C130J over the NTTR (250ft, 250kts, 2G: no ill effects). Definitely a career highpoint.
4. Riding shotgun in a RAAF C130J mission to the NTTR.
3. Standing a few hundred feet from threshold during #RedFlag sortie returns
2. Sitting inside Roland SAM battery and on 37mm AAA battery
1. Sitting in cockpit of MiG23 (terrible view!) &amp; MiG29 (Good view; more spacious than I thought, poor placement of circuit breakers though)
Now into the final week of #RedFlag with the @NellisAFB crew. Highlights so far, in no particular order:
@JohnBirmingham I would like to read the rest of this book, Sir
@pennjillette I made a really lame "It's Tricky" joke about my iPhone camera last week after your show and I've felt awful about it since.
