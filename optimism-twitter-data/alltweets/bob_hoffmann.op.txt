Live simply.  Love generously.  Speak truthfully.  Breathe deeply.  Do your best.  Leave everything else to God.
The joy, peace, support, love and comfort of a happy family is the greatest of God's gifts in this life. Grateful beyond words for mine <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Not everyone will appreciate what you do for them. You have to figure out who’s worth your attention and who’s just taking advantage of you.
Saying yes to happiness means learning to say no to the people and things that hurt you.  Be wise enough to walk away from the negativity.
@OG_Hunter <BASKETBALL AND HOOP>
Never let your fear decide your future.
Growth and change may be painful sometimes, but nothing in life is as painful as staying stuck where you don’t belong.
The quality of a father can be seen in the goals, dreams and aspirations he sets not only for himself, but for his family.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
Attempt courageous things. As your courage expands, so does your character.
Happy Birthday @ConnorSteeby 
Keep working hard. One day, if you work real hard, you'll be as awesome as me <WINKING FACE>

It's a sad day when you find out that it's not accident or fortune but just yourself and the choices you made that kept things from you.
Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher.
A dad is someone who wants to catch you before you fall but instead picks you up, brushes you off, and lets you try again over and over.

Listen, my son, to your father's instruction They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. Proverbs 1:8-9
How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
Thankful for thoughtful and loving sons <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

Everything happens for a reason. Sometimes the reason is you're stupid and make bad decisions.
A loving father is the only one that walks into your life when the world has walked out.
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life.
A fabulous dinner with the family tonight. Cfer loves those crescent rolls <MEAT ON BONE><SPAGHETTI><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Family time is the best time <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Remember, u can earn more money, but when time is spent, it is gone forever. Use ur time wisely &amp; spend it on things and people that matter.
You can't allow your feelings to determine your future. Every great thing God has for u is activated when you live with expectancy and hope
Life becomes harder for us when we live for others, but it also becomes richer and happier.
When writing the story of your life, don’t let anyone else hold the pen.
Life is short, live it. Love is rare, grab it. Anger is bad, dump it. Fear is awful, face it. Memories are sweet, cherish it.

A Father dosen't just tell you that he loves you.
He shows you. In every big and small way, he displays his love openly and without shame.
Love your family. Spend time, be kind &amp; serve one another. Make no room for regrets. Tomorrow is not promised &amp; today is short.
Opportunity wasted. Future squandered. Love rejected. Hope displaced. Relationships betrayed. Sin always demands more than we anticipated.

No love is greater than that of a father for His son.

Indecision becomes decision with time.
We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.
The hardest thing about the road not taken is that you never know where it might have led.
@LaneHoffmann NOTHING
It's humbling to start fresh. It takes a lot of courage. You just have to put your ego on a shelf &amp; tell it to be quiet &amp; begin the journey
#WhyImNotVotingForHillary 
Too many lies, cover ups and dodging. She's not fit to be President. Can't be trusted.
Pride is concerned with WHO is right. 
Humility is concerned with WHAT is right.
It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.
Three things will last forever--faith, hope, and love--and the greatest of these is love.

We judge ourselves by our intentions. And others by their actions.
Never trust your tongue when your heart is bitter <WINKING FACE>
The reason why we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind the scenes with everyone else's highlight reel.
Repentance means you change your mind so deeply that it changes you.

@Alyssa_Whittle When you've paid as many freakin parking tickets for your kid attending IU it's not a joke!
Greedy bastards
The first and worst of all frauds is to cheat one’s self. All sin is easy after that.
The difficulty we have in accepting responsibility for our behavior lies in the desire to avoid the pain of the consequences.

Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
A winner never stops trying
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge,
but rather a lack of will.
football is like life - it requires perserverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority.
You can be committed to Church but not committed to Christ, but you cannot be committed to Christ and not committed to church.

@IanMcSteezy Another persons happiness is not your responsibility. Kindness is up to you. Happiness is a personal decision everyone makes.
If you choose bad companions, no one will believe that you are anything but bad yourself.

Don't let the negative things spoken over you, even if it's by the people who raised you, determine your destiny. God's plan is greatness.

Strength is a matter of the made-up mind.
A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them.
God brings men into deep waters, not to drown them, but to cleanse them.
If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere.
The only thing that overcomes hard luck is hard work.

The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.

Never expect anything good from someone that never does anything good.
Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.
You can make positive deposits in your life every day by associating with encouraging and hope-building people.

Life is all about Making Choices, we get to choose one among the many, and the one we choose defines our Future and Destiny. Choose wisely.
In everyone's life our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another person. Be thankful for those people.
An insincere and evil friend is more feared than a wild beast; a wild beast may wound your body, but an evil friend will wound your soul.
Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.
I don't regret the things I've done wrong as much as I regret the good things I've done for the wrong people.
@Sexy_Lexy96 Sometimes the hardest part of the journey is believing you're worthy of the trip.
Be thankful for your blessings and never doubt your struggles. Don't ask why they happened, just be thankful for the strength they gave you.
Blessed is the influence of one true, loving human soul on another.
My principle is that you don't make decisions because they are easy or cheap or popular; you make them because they are right.
The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live. The path you choose to follow determines where you go &amp; who travels with you.
It's sad when people give up lasting and  important things for pointless temporary things. The human condition - Short-sighted and foolish.
It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. You usually know the right thing to do, the hard part is doing.
Choose your friends carefully... "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm." Proverbs 13:20. So says GOD <CHURCH>️
When you base your life on principle, 99% of your decisions are already made. The hardest thing is which bridge to cross and which to burn.
It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are.
It's not hard to decide what you want your life to be about. What's hard, is figuring out what you're willing to give up to live that life.
Anyone who doesn't take truth seriously in small matters cannot be trusted in large ones either.
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, your character is what you are, your reputation is what others think you are
Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.
We shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. The process never ends. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility.
Can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear <PIG FACE>
Even the most caring people can get tired of being taken for granted.
People hold onto the wrong person because they THINK they can CHANGE them into the right person for them.
Talent is a bonus, but persistence is what wins out every time.
To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved.
Never surrender your hopes and dreams to the fateful limitations others have placed on their own lives. Reach for success, leave them behind
Trust is like a mirror..once its BROKEN you can never look at it the same again...
Betrayal is the only truth that sticks
Always tell the truth. If you can't always tell the truth, don't lie.
Whatever controls you controls your destiny and the choices you make today have consequences into the future.
Every choice you make has an end result. If you're unhappy with the end result then change the choice.
Many will say they are loyal friends, but who can find one who is truly reliable? Proverbs 20:6
Our lives are a sum total of the choices we have made. Choose wisely.
We shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility, as are the consequences.
Some people create their own storms and then get mad when it rains.

Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.
Outstanding leaders go out of the way to boost the self-esteem of others. If people believe in themselves, it's amazing what they can do.
If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.
Leaders are made, not born. They are made by hard effort, which is the price all of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.

Go where you are celebrated – not tolerated. If they can’t see the real value of you, it’s time for a new start.
Life is real, not ideal.
Often the right path is the one that may be hardest to follow. But the hard path is also the one that will make you grow as a human being.
Serving people is the best way to earn influence.
Greatness is in influence, and not in affluence. It is not achieved by being a 'paper millionaire', but by being a 'people millionaire'
A year from today, it will be Good if your life is positively different, but GREAT if your life has made a positive difference on others.
The attitude you hold is greatly influenced by your friends. Good friends, good attitudes; best friends, best attitudes. Toxic friends...?
A motivator sees potential in people and tells them to take action. A leader sees potential in the same people and influences for success.

@Sexy_Lexy96 "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well." Psalm 139:14
You’ll never change yourself or the world just by complaining.
You can’t change the past. You can’t even change the future. You can only change the present one moment at a time - and change your outcome.
With one kind gesture you can change a life. One person at a time you can change the world. One day at a time we can change everything.
Small changes can make huge destination differences.

It doesn't matter what you did or where you were...it matters where you are and what you're doing. Get out there!
No matter who you are, no matter what you did, no matter where you've come from, you can always change, become a better version of yourself.
Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.
Change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.

Sometimes the threat is not those that oppose you, it's those that were supposed to be beside you. Loyalty is rare.
The worst kinds of enemies are those who pretend to be your friends.
Resolutions are most often empty promises for those who have an abundance of dreams, but refuse to wake up and live them.
You want people in your life you can count on, depend on? Then be a person people can depend on and count on.
Want to Change? Become better? Do something great? Reach your potential? Start by telling the truth and keeping your word.
Promises are only as strong as the person who gives them ...
@t_harrell_12 Happy Birthday Trevor. Love you buddy!
With my dear friend LTG Bob Caslen, West Point Sup, and his wife Shelly. 
Great win @cg_coach_moore. Way to keep your cool in the face of the worst officiating I've seen. Proud of CG Football!
Absolutely worst officials. Doing everything possible to give the game to Carmel

Whatever you attempt, if your attitude sucks, so will you.
Learn to use the criticism as fuel and you will never run out of energy.
The more you learn, the more you earn. Hence, to earn more, learn more.
@N_Snyder9 And you are coming over Sat? Awesome! Wild times <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@N_Snyder9 I will be there cheering you on <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
The IMPOSSIBLE is ONLY relevant to those who NEVER attempt it…otherwise it is ABSTRACT and MEANINGLESS
What have you gained since you haven't prayed? What will you lose if you pray?
Erase self-doubt by working to build your strengths instead of focusing on your weaknesses.
Let your playerhaters be your motivators.

When you live your life by poor standards, you inflict damage on everyone who crosses your path, especially those you love.
Faithfulness in small things leads to faithfulness in great things, and never the other way around.
Motivation gets you going and habit gets you there.
Love is forgiving, accepting, moving on, embracing, all encompassing. If you’re not doing that for yourself, you can't do that with anyone.
@IanMcSteezy And I expect a ride I'm your new whip.
@IanMcSteezy I'm not going to do what you should do for yourself. However, I have my way and you do yours. Got it?
@IanMcSteezy A conspiracy, no doubt!
I got this buddy!
@IanMcSteezy What!!?? Seems like they would want you. How many times have you called back to check on a job?
Talent is a wonderful thing, but it won't carry a quitter.
@IanMcSteezy Why? Get a job, save your money and buy a nice car. Easy <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@t_harrell_12 Thanks Trevor. I love you too and always enjoy what you have to say.
Nick modeling the $210 jeans he wanted to buy! @recnepskcin 
Before you speak, think: Is it necessary? Is it true? Is it kind? Will it hurt anyone? Will it improve on the silence?
Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.
You're never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you're never as bad as they say when you lose. Believe in yourself.

It's essential you create a fiery will from within--harness that power of decisiveness--and choose to be your strongest self. Never quit!
We may get knocked down on the outside, but the key to living in victory is to learn how to get up on the inside.
You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
Never hide things from hardcore thinkers. They get more aggravated, more provoked by confusion than the most painful truths.
If I told you I’ve worked hard to get where I’m at, I’d be lying, because I have no idea where I am right now! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

Never forget 3 types of people in your life. 1 Who helped you in tough times. 2 Who left you in tough times. 3 Who put you in tough times.
I do not believe in excuses. I believe in hard work as the prime solvent of life's problems.
It is wise to direct your anger towards problems - not people; to focus your energies on answers - not excuses.
In life, everybody faces choices between doing what's popular, easy, and wrong vs. doing what's lonely, difficult, and right.
Work hard and never make excuses.
Great potential carries great responsibility. Wasted and squandered potential is the highest insult to everyone invested in your life.
I get so weary with people always making excuses. Leadership is about taking responsibility, not making excuses. Man up! Be the leader.
Miley 
Hanging with @syddykitty and @LaneHoffmann
Disappointed.
What gives me hope every day is God's grace; knowing his grace is going 2 give me strength for whatever I face. Nothing is a surprise 2 God.
A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.
Climbing to the top demands strength, whether it is to the top of Mount Everest or to the top of your career or to the top of your game!
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
To be fully seen by somebody, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.
I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?

Through hard work, perseverance and a faith in God, you can live your dreams.
You aren't going to find anybody that's going to be successful without making a sacrifice and without perseverance.
I do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as perseverance. It overcomes almost everything.
Winning is doing the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.
Football is like life - it requires perseverance, self-denial, hard work, sacrifice, dedication and respect for authority.
Be true to your work, your word, and your friends.
One of my retired players called today to thank me for keeping him on track financially and focused on building assets not investments. :D

As a child my family's menu consisted of two choices: take it or leave it.
You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. Control what you can. Let the rest go...
Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.
Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell till you give it a try.
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.
Keep away from people who try to belittle ur ambitions. Small people do that, but the really great make u feel that u, too, can become great
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little "extra.”
The elevator to success is out of order. You’ll have to use the stairs … one step at a time.
People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who usually do.
Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.
Very sad day for me :(

There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.
The safest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it in your pocket. If it sounds too good to be true, be careful.
Save part of your income and begin now. The man with a surplus controls circumstances and the man without it is controlled by circumstances
Too many people spend money they earned..to buy things they don't need...to impress people that they don't like...and end up broke.
Leaving someone is easy, not going back to them is the hard part.
Don't over use your heart in loving someone... Sometimes you need to use your brain to stop the pain...
Life is hard; it’s harder if you’re stupid.
Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem, first make sure you are not, in fact, just surrounded by total idiots.
Build a man a fire and he’ll be warm for an hour. Set a man on fire, and he’ll be warm for the rest of his life.
Be kinder than necessary for everyone is fighting some kind of battle.

The two most important days in your life are the day you are born, and the day you find out why.

Commitment eats impossible for breakfast.
Begin where you are and with what you have and go from there. The "someday" syndrome has kept many from improving right where they are.
You WILL eventually become what you think. Whether you succeed or fail is determined in ur mind long before we see it play out in real-time.
I am sick of incompetence, dishonesty, laziness and stupidity. Honestly, how hard is it?

Failure isn't bad if it doesn't attack the heart. Success is all right if it doesn't go to the head. Do great. Be humble.
Success will come if you continue to believe in yourself even when no one is left believing in you!
Monthly Center Grove Education Foundation meeting. Working to fund educational opportunities for CG students. 
The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you find yourself.
Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then...do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen.
No matter what your sacred or religious book is, it's not how well you know the book, it's how well you're in alignment with the author.

I don't know the keys to success, but one key to failure is to try to please everyone.

@bob_hoffmann: Your behavior is a direct outcome of your belief. - Pastor Philbeck
I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves.
I am not a victim. No matter what I have been through, I'm still here. I have a history of victory.
We must transcend the illusion that money or power has any bearing on our worthiness as children of God.
The backbone of success is...hard work, determination, good planning, and perseverance.
Do not sabotage your new relationship with your last relationship’s poison.
You've been given the power 2 shape ur life. But you can't speak change, you have 2 LIVE change. Intent paired with action builds success.
Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end.

Rich people have small TVs and big libraries, and poor people have small libraries and big TVs.
At the end of the day, let there be no excuses, no explanations, no regrets.
Success is most often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary.
Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to change it.

I definitely think there could be stricter teen driving laws.
Adolescence is when girls experience social pressure to put aside their authentic selves and to display only a small portion of their gifts.

Men think its every woman's dream to find the perfect man. Actually, it's her dream to eat whatever she wants without getting fat!
Nick stops mid-sentence and makes this face for several seconds while taking with random people. Then keeps talking. 
The boys love the ladies :) 
The boys love the ladies :) 
The boys look studly with their little fish tattoos. 
Happy Independence Day! God Bless America.
However, Nick. If specific limits of behavior have been established by those in authority over you they are to be followed perfectly. 100%
@syddompier @aw_k_ward I hear that a lot...
You should know your limits but never accept them. Because great and good are seldom the same person.
The difference between school and life? In school ur taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, ur given a test that teaches u a lesson
A goal without a plan is just a wish.
@McdonoughRoss  Miss you buddy!
Winning isn't everything. But the will and desire to win is...
People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people never forget how you made them feel.
Life is too short to stress yourself with people who don’t even deserve to be an issue in your life.
Taylor tried this one...Hi, the voices in my head told me to come over and talk to you.  Needless to say - FAIL. But very, very funny.
Nathanael tried this pick-up line on a girl today; Baby did you fart, ’cause you blow me away.    It didn't work!!
Pool, then beach. Then pool, then beach. Pool, beach. Pool, beach. Pool, beach. The only consistent thing? Girls :) 
@OG_Hunter Get on your bike and head on down!!!


My whittle baby working out HARD this morning. Then a 2 mile run on the beach. Hitting it serious! 
The boys worked out hard this morning. Then a 2 mile run on the beach. 
@OG_Hunter Me!!
Travel is hard on little Nicky 
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
Judge not, so you are not judged. With the same judgement you pass on others will you be judged.
By judging others we blind ourselves to our own evil and to the grace which others are just as entitled to as we are.
We all make our choices, but in the end our choices make us. Life is not a matter of chance...it's a matter of choice.
It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are.
@LaneHoffmann You are hotter buddy! My sweet, little baby boy ;)
@McdonoughRoss Or...
You can work to make it what it should be :)
Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there!
If it weren't for electricity I'd be watching television by candlelight!
I wouldn't join a club that would allow someone like me as a member.
Too many people buy things they don't need with money they don't have to impress people they don't like!
It's never too late to become what you might have been.
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength or a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.
The two most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you find out why.
World War Z
@McdonoughRoss Yes you do!
To have a good friend is one of the highest delights of life; to be a good friend is one of the noblest and most difficult undertakings.
Pool time :)
@LaneHoffmann Yes I do! It means I'm HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY
Build your own dreams and master your own goals, or someone else will hire you and build theirs.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. Fall down seven times - get up eight.
Sitting on the back deck with Coach Murphy. Good times.
@McdonoughRoss Come on over and I will feed you.
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal. There are no traffic jams along the extra mile!!
When my life ends and I stand before God, I hope I have no talents left and can say, I used everything you gave me!
@N_Snyder9 NEXT
Thanks for the help Nathanael! Awesome job.
Who wants to do a little work and earn a few bucks? First to call gets the job!
@N_Snyder9 EVERYONE likes Nathanael!!
@McdonoughRoss EVER? Wow
@pastorphilbeck Today we had a gold metal winner! A couple showed up at 9:54, sat down and took notes and left early!! Hilarious :)
I love hearing this guy sing. Great heart.  Go Jerry Hacker!! 
Worship at MPCC. Rockin the house this morning! 
@pastorphilbeck 11 minutes and still empty. Everyone is coming to the 9:30 and 11:15 services! 
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. Start where you are, use what you have and then do what you can.
@N_Snyder9 If your not confused, then you're not paying attention.
Doing the right thing never requires deceit or subterfuge; it is always simple and direct. We know the right thing to do, doing it is harder
It is our choices that reflect who we really are, far more than our abilities.
@N_Snyder9 BEEP BEEP
A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back when you've forgotten the words.
A person always doing his or her best becomes a natural leader, just by example.
I have the most simple tastes. I am always satisfied with the best :)
Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.
Disappointment is the word of the day :(
@LaneHoffmann Really? I don't think so. Maybe top 10 but not close to number 1. Come on Son.....
World War Z!!!
If  If's and but's were candy and nuts we'd all have a Merry Christmas!!
Success in life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
Never place a bet on a horse named tripod.
People who find excuses rather than solutions drive me crazy!
Take responsibility for yourself, own your failures. Growth begins only then.
Eskimos use refrigerators to keep food from freezing.
@OG_Hunter Easy there, big fella
People will hate you, rate you, shake you, and break you. But how strong you stand is what makes you.
Change is inevitable. Progress is optional.
@OG_Hunter Life is what you make it Scottie. Take your frown and turn it upside down :(  -  :)
There is a direct correlation between effort and result. The secret to success isn't a secret; Hard work, discipline and determination.
Be more concerned with ur character than ur reputation, because ur character is what u are, while ur reputation is what others think u are
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Do not let what you can not do interfere with what you can do. Fall down seven times, get up eight.
@wake_en_jake Come on over. I have all the needed equipment.
Crew grows by the minute in number and beauty :) 
What a crew!! 
@Big_Sleazy4 @gunduck33 It's the school, not the student :)
A tough life... 
Pool time :) 
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
One of the most important keys to success is having the discipline to do what you know you should do, even when you don't feel like doing it
Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?
On my last flight I had an epiphany. Why do they have floatation devices under the seat instead of parachutes?
The high road is always respected. Honesty and integrity are always rewarded. It takes strength and courage to deal in truth.
@McdonoughRoss I love that record.
Summer and Josie decorating cupcakes 
Beware of wolves in Sheep's clothing - Matthew 17:5
I get weary of excuses, unkept promises, failure to follow-thru and laziness in people. Be what you should be or get out of the way!
@McdonoughRoss At least it's the last day!
Do u have enemies? Good! That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.  U only live once, but if done right, it's enough
Life is a game, play it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is an opportunity, capture it.
@crawford_Jonah @McdonoughRoss Up late to play - up early to pay.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
@recnepskcin Come on over!
Courage is not the absence of fear, but understanding something else is more important than fear. You'll miss 100% of the shots u don't take
Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
Character is much easier kept than recovered. If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don't, nothing else matters.
@McdonoughRoss That's awesome!
@elkins_taylor @bob__ It was crazy! I stayed up to almost 11PM. Im an animal :)
@N_Snyder9 - your agent to get on your calendar?
@N_Snyder9 Maybe you will honor our lowly abode with your celebrity and athletic presence again some day :)  Do we have to schedule with
@etch_a_sketchhh @aw_k_ward No parties planned. But one will be planned soon. And you two lovely ladies will be the guests of honor :)
@etch_a_sketchhh Your life must be pretty boring if its a big deal that I followed you :)
@genesimmons I normally ask to be moved and don't create a scene. Being nice is always the best :)
@N_Snyder9 Awesome job buddy!
@pastorphilbeck And I am very thankful for that simple truth :)
@hardwina Nothing like it, Nick. Any man can be a father, but it takes a special one to be a dad. Hope to see you on my next visit.
@N_Snyder9 Grammar check...
Home :)
@MikeMcCartney7 I love your dad too, Mike. He made a dynamic and lasting impact on me and my family.
Any man can be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad! My wonderful boys makes every day seem like Fathers Day.
Baked Alaska!

Headed to Michael Jordan's Steak House. Love it!

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference - Frost
@elkins_taylor For you buddy :)
Although you can't go back and make a new start, you can start now and make a new ending!
No one can cheat you out of your ultimate success but yourself.
@elkins_taylor My daughter, Gabby!
Look who came to visit :) 
@McdonoughRoss Calm down buddy. All is well.
@pastorphilbeck You have zero patience!
Going to see Man Of Steel today.  A movie based loosely on my life, by the way :)
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because its right.
Motivation is a fire within. If someone else  tries to light that fire within you it will burn briefly.
Always be yourself. Unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate!
When following your dreams, always be young. In relationships with others, always be a grown-up.
You only need to do a very few things right in your life, as long as you don't do too many things wrong!

The boys swimming...again :) 
@McdonoughRoss  :(
@N_Snyder9 I don't have snap thing so I can't. Come on over and join the gang. Fun fun

@SHAQ Hey Shaq. Check out Solehope, a ministry providing shoes in the country of Uganda. You could make huge impact by supporting!
@K_MillerLite In most states your arrested for the kind of mugging that happened to Cody the entire game.
@MikeMcCartney7 If Zeller had been mugged anymore he would have only had his jock strap left.
@MikeMcCartney7 some of the worst officials I've seen. It was determined before the game that IU would lose.
@wake_en_jake Not true. Takes both.
@wake_en_jake A party at my place!!
@wake_en_jake Not so, my young apprentice. It means you are being careful and thorough. An admirable trait in every successful businessman!

Cfer set the smoke alarm off with his meal at dinner.
