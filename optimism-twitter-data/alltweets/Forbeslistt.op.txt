Well didn't do my vocabulary tonight so yeah im not graduating according to mr.coleman..

Many gonna use that shit against you when you're on bad terms
I hate when someone tells me "I'm not going anywhere" because that's what everyone's says and then they are gone.
Don't think you can change someone. You can't. No matter how hard you try.
This has been the longest day of my life..
I've never ever felt this way before..
So annoying
Shout out to the teachers that are still trying to teach and giving out busy work.
Can we just graduate already..

People can say who they are but your actions speak louder than words.
I'm just gonna stay occupied and distant from everyone.


I told myself when I got into bed last night that I wasn't going to school today.
I wish I was in Philly today to spend this day with my family for my great grandma

Yep that's annoying <OK HAND SIGN>üèæ
Talking to someone that's been through what your going through always gives you the best advice.
I've realized you can't just talk to anyone about your problems unless they have been through what your going through.
Real bosses don't talk we just sit back and listen
It's been one of those days.
I need to figure out what is really worth my time.
Need to clear my mind.
Pushing me far far away.
Judgmental people irk my nerves
I just wanna go home now<DISAPPOINTED FACE>

Practice what you preach.
People need to understand that there's a time to change the subject and there's a time not to change the subject.

@EvvStar @DCxoxo_ I was dying when you whispered in my ear and told me what happened<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Life is too short to not enjoy it and do what you want for the short period of time we have on this earth.
Be careful about the bridges you burn, you never know when you might need it to walk across.
I want that one person in my life that I can talk about anything and everything to and stay up past 12 on the phone.
Okay i'm done fighting my sleep rain you got me..
@GrannerTrazier @BarbersPosts yeah you need to talk to him and ask him what's going on in his mind<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I don't understand why some things happen.
Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
It's a wrap.
Feelings are hurt on the daily<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
What I need from you is understanding how can we communicate if you don't hear what I say.
I remember all the bad things anyone has ever said to me.
Sometimes you just have to let things go after you've tried for so long to work thinks out but your still where you started at years ago.
Sticking to my word this time.
Where are you when I need you.
Too many judgemental people in this world for me.
Terrible night
I rather be somewhere else.
Not worth it anymore.
It's crazy how life works and how we aren't promised tomorrow.
Currently blowing up instagram with prom pictures it's fine.
Prom

It's always hard to leave this private show <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Jealousy is the ugliest trait.
‚Ä¢Enjoy life and all the laughs with friends like ya'll‚Ä¢ <GROWING HEART>

Being overprotective isn't a bad thing I rather have someone in my life overprotective than not caring at all.
@myah_marie forreal lets go!

Annoyed at the moment..
Will no longer go out of my way to talk to anyone ever again.

Much needed day.

Never will I ever eat at McDonald's ever again<FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>

Fake is the new trend can't trust anyone.

I hate to admit this but I miss you.
It's so funny how people fall off the face of the earth when they get into a relationship but that's fine just when y'all break up don't hmu
It's gonna be a busy busy week.
All I wanna do today is lay in bed and I think I may just do that<SMIRKING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>

Once your treated like shit by someone for no reason after everything that's your key to keep it moving.
Sometimes it's better to learn your lesson the hard way.

My face is seriously trying to break out right before prom<RAISED HAND>
Need to get on my high.
Not getting into my feelings tonight it's not even worth it at this point<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Just woke up from a 3hr nap and still tired..
Once true colors are showed I have to force myself to move on because I know the real deal when everything is said and done.
Maybe this is what's best for me after all

Refuse to keep picking myself up just for you to bring me right back down.
Lost so much respect.
People are just trying to piss me off and test my patience today<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
It was good seeing the fam @vroddddd last night it's been a minute but stay on your grind and outta trouble!<FISTED HAND SIGN>
I swear im so blessed.
It doesn't even seem like I got any sleep last night.
I seriously do not want to go to school today..
Down in the dumps.
This is getting old.
It's so frustrating how i can go from happy to depressed within 10 minutes..
The way im feeling..<THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Probably won't last but im optimistic.
But life goes on<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I miss my old best friend<BROKEN HEART>
Is it worth trying at this point..
To be honest there's so much I just don't care about anymore because within 2 months it'll all be a memory anyways.
It's been a pretty good day.
Need a stress reliever asap.
I wish social media didn't exist.
Just want what we once had.
Hope this isn't awkward..
Trying to please everyone is a recipe for stress, misery and frustration. Be yourself. It'll be good to know who's down with that.
I'll be sleeping good tonight.
It's gonna be a good day!<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è

People need to understand that you can't take back the words you say to someone they're forever and they can either make or break someone.
Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do for the best of your benefit.
I crack myself up.
Im just ready to get this day started though<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Going through my pictures looking at all the memories I have made my senior year realizing it's almost over<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Ready for these summer nights. 
‚Äú@wavypng: Rule #1: never be #2‚Äù
I can't be upset because I saw this coming and i've been preparing myself for this all week.
Pretty freaking cold in my house.
Wish I could go back to sleep..
I don't want to have to break it down to you.
I've gotta stop.
I just don't want to get attached and im keeping that in mind with every conversation we have from here on out.
Im confused
Stressing<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I kinda just want my old life back but then again....
I shouldn't have reset my phone<FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
My phone just put me through so much stress.
For some reason I just laughed so hard at @D_the_big_G snapchat and he's not even funny.....
It's like a girls night in this house with the boys being gone all weekend.
Trying to forget about someone that once meant something to you is hard but is worth it after all the pain and sorrows they put you through.
‚Äú@hey_tay03: Done reaching out to people who never reach out to me.‚Äù
Need something to put me to sleep.
My high school days are coming to an end and I can say one thing ive spent my precious time on people that proved they weren't worth my time
Literally still laughing so hard at my last RT<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Sometimes I wish I wasn't the person that remembers everything anyone has ever done to me bc im real bad at holding grudges.
Chelsea is playing games tonight..<UNAMUSED FACE>
Not worth it.
Just ya know doing good ole vocabulary for government on this good friday night wbu.
I have so much to say but I can't figure out how to say it in a nicely mannered way..
Really looking forward to meeting new people after high school.
Still upset that my brothers are seriously gone for the weekend which means they aren't spending Easter with me<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I wanna be forever young.
Why are my txts sending twice and slow..
People start acting so different when they get around certain people it amazes me.
Literally starving at this point<WEARY FACE>
When we arrive at eternity's shore where death is just a memory and tears are no more.
@TheLeviShow_ what?
We're back on childish mode<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You make beautiful things you make beautiful things out of the dust you make beautiful things you make beautiful things out of us.
‚Äú@iamShawnMoss: For all the "Men" who beat on women.......you're a bitch.‚Äù There's literally no nicer way to say this sorry not sorry.
@EvvStar do it<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I enjoy storms with a passion.
I love this weather<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I don't need shady in my life<VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
Sorry but I have no kind of respect for people that judge someone based off of the color of their skin.
What's cute about calling someone out of their name??
I just wanna go do something adventurous with a friend it feels good outside im tired of laying in bed looking up at the ceiling.
Be different don't follow the crowd.
Boring ass day..
Well I guess i'll be in the house by myself until tomorrow.
I don't even know what to do with myself at this point.
Severe weather today good i'll just be laying in bed all day anyways..
My mom is clearly not good with names she just called Lindsay Hillary<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@fearthespearfsu haha miss yall!
The fact that my brothers aren't spending Easter with us makes me sad.
Time to focus on one thing and that's myself.
Love random texts from people before I go to bed makes my heart happy.
I haven't lived life<SMIRKING FACE>
Just another depressed teen with a smile always on my face.
These are just signs of red flags.
This is so tiring.
Fucked up again.
This is why the way I am.
@MissAntBabbyy16 saw too much..<FLUSHED FACE>
Dang that hurt<PENSIVE FACE>
Dang im childish<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
So many new things I want to try
I love going through my moms phone..
When my life is a mess and I don't where to begin I just laugh about it.
Im just ready for those late summer nights ya know..
People really know how to piss me off every night before I go to bed.
Feel sick to my stomach and idek why..

It is what it is!
I bet all her friends are being nosey- Linds <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

Can Linds come home though..
@BC_THE_G I miss you too <WEARY FACE>
Nothing but memories <PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL> 
I've learned everybody isn't meant to stay in your life they were just mistakes in your life from the beginning.
@_MissPitts I've seen too many and a lot of blue lights im in for the night<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Police are hot tonight.
At this doctor they talk too much..<UNAMUSED FACE>
I could use a nap<SLEEPING FACE>
My little brother hates fish so we got him thinking he's eating long chicken strips<WEARY FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Should have left you in the past when I had the chance.
Graduating next month the moment i've been waiting for all my life!!
Happy Birthday!!<CONFETTI BALL><PARTY POPPER><FACE THROWING A KISS>@H0LLY_woood
Thankful for how God keeps on wrecking my plans when he sees that they are about to wreck me God is good even when im selfish he never fails
Hate feeling this way daily..
Something's gotta give soon.
Every little thing we come in contact with is temporary.
It's been an all around good day<WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
‚Äú@VeroBrands: <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
But on the bright side I haven't been April fooled<SMIRKING FACE>
The moment you just wanna call up your friend and tell them about your eventful day but then you realize ya'll aren't on tlking terms..<RELIEVED FACE>
Let's talk about my life getting tried today.
Never get your hopes up.
Bees and wasp are like bullies they know they will win at the end of the day.
This day is just coming along great!
Today's a new day start it the way you want it to be ended its up to you.<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Never get attached in any relationship or friendship everything comes to an end.
Can't stay like this forever.
Sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone and doing things you never imagined you would have ever done is what it takes for your benefit.
Why do people expect me to be there for them at their lowest when they weren't even their for me at my lowest<SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
Crazy how much as changed and you don't even realize it until you get on Twitter and they something like this "who remembers these days".
Dont ignore who loves you cares for you and misses you bc you may wake up from ur sleep to realize u lost the moon while counting the stars.
I showed you off every chance I got but did you do the same.
STOP BLOWING UP MY PHONE!!
I feel like i've wasted so much time on the wrong person this whole time..
Had to delete that felt like too many of my followers were about to be butt hurt over it..
Debating if I even wanna go to prom or if I just wanna hit up the after parties<THOUGHT BALLOON>
Ready for bed<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Everything happens for a reason.
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you.
Sad Af..
@YO_CRIPS @Queen_BBC_Alex lol who wouldn't wanna be you<FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>

Chelsea is about to get a spray tan I can't wait to see this<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
It's kinda sad that i've let myself go this far with no regrets.
I need to start going back to church and getting back into the word on the daily.
The moment you think this a joke but then you realize the other opponent is taking it to the heart im done<SLEEPING FACE>
She will get merked one hit she's out I take no Ls<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LindsayHerndon <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
So fucking annoying!!
@LindsayHerndon the moment when I wasn't talking about you did you even read my message?<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@papa_layne be safe fam.
When I get hit with a ntb it shows me where I stand at in thr friendship<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Last rt story of my life<RELIEVED FACE>
So tomorrow is literally April... March flew by and time is flying by im not sure how I feel about graduating it's getting bittersweet<CRYING FACE>
Chelsea grinds my gears<CONFOUNDED FACE>
Just trying to better myself at this point..
@_courtneyyd_ that's what happens to everyone<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Sometimes you just have to let things go with the flow.
There's just some things I don't like sharing with others for example my bestfriend but i'll stop right there..
I have a lot to be thankful for that I look over every single day.
I love having those friends that I can relate to when im having a certain problem(s) because it makes everything so much easier.
I have so many heat bumps from being outside all day yesterday. Ok..
Hopefully there will be a better outcome after all this passes and it will all be worth it.
All I need is a white dread head in my life<WEARY FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><OK HAND SIGN>
On the bright side I get to see Chelsea today<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Trying to go somewhere out of my comfort zone.
My mom literally makes me clean up everyday..
@EvvStar bae<FACE THROWING A KISS>
Pain is all I feel.
First time for everything.
Not worth it anymore.
I need one of those unexpected texts
I've been somewhat happy these past two days up until now..
Got replaced the first time and I see it coming around for a second time but I won't be waiting this time after y'all aren't "cool" anymore.
When I care about someone I get over protective because their feelings are my feelings so once they get hurt im hurt too.
I love going back and reading old conversations in my phone.
Can someone just txt me that's willing to talk about anything and everything and keep a conversation going.
@EvvStar omw<WINKING FACE>
Second chances aren't for anyone and everyone.
The fact that Lindsay just slapped me across the face with her headphones<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I just want a friend that's afraid to loose me just as much as im afraid to loose them.
I hate being ignored but seems like everything I have to say is ignored and doesn't deserve a freakin response.
Just don't like people that think their slick especially when it's behind my back.
I learned from my parents mistakes on how not to raise a child especially when you aren't ready for one.
You would think family would always be here for you but guess it what it is.
Family is not about blood it's about who is willing to hold your hand when you need it the most.
Hate when people don't stick to their word.
It's always something.
Always speak how you feel and never be sorry for being real.
@EvvStar it's the truth if you actually think about it they mad cause they couldn't afford to go or they mama said no<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The heart wants what it wants.
People that talk bad about everyone in panama are just mad because they aren't there<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I already know today will be a good day!

But once people get the yelling at me.. 

I'm done.
Sometimes I just need my space from people but then there's the people I could deal with 24/7.
Linds and my mom think i'm petty but they haven't even seen nothing<WEARY FACE>
If someone doesn't wanna talk to you and your blowing up their phone by txting and calling them leave it at that don't come to their house..
If guy wants you for your breast, thighs and legs, send him to KFC you're a lady, not a cheap value meal.
Staying to myself from now on I will be okay.
I saw this coming for sure.
It's bad when your a liar but it's even worse when your a bad liar.
I'm stubborn.
Funny how people talk so down on people that are always depressed like its something we can control there really is such thing as depression
This is not where I expected to be today.
When you talk like your so committed to a sport would you really be out partying  or would you be somewhere on a field or in them books <THOUGHT BALLOON>.
Just wanna have a good night.
Slick annoyed..
It's such a good feeling always feeling like someone's back up plan (-:
I should know by now to never get my hopes up unless I want my feelings hurt.
That Tennessee view. 
People that are in relationships and tell one another the first couple of months they "love" each other are the ones that make me nervous.
May 16th just needs to hurry up.
I want to do so much but I guess i'll keep on wishing.
I hate not having my own car.
When I call someone I expect them to answer the phone not the person their with too answer or I would have called them..
It's only Saturday and im already dying of boredom it's gonna be a long spring break<TIRED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
When im alone I get really depressed.
The majority of people are either in Panama, Atlanta, or at home for spring break.
Im the girl that will screen shot everything to my bestfriend and we will talk and joke about the situation but ask me if we care<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
This is awkward<FLUSHED FACE>
Dang you already got another bae that was fast<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The embarrassing moment when you have someone's tweets come to your phone and your with them and they don't know..
I'll hold you down.
Happy 15th birthday lil sis<GROWING HEART> 
Just wait on it im next.
Soo sooo irritated.
Life goes on.
I stick to the script I memorize the lines cause life is movie that i've seen too many times<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I haven't lived the good life yet.
@jes_000x I feel ya<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
My feelings for you haven't changed.
Some people can just talk and it'll hit a nerve in my body and piss me off.
@jes_000x yeaaa hahahaha you know it's real when he brings the iPad along he got a little to comfortable on the toilet<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I get really pissed off when a video or picture I post on snapchat gets deleted.
My little brother went all out for this dump<PILE OF POO><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
It sucks when you've been trying so long to get someone's attention and they aren't realizing it.
@chelseameyer_ love you praying for safe travels!
Nothing seems right at this point.
It makes my heart happy for everyone going on mission trips over the spring break.
Im getting all my work done today so I don't have to stress over the break about my grades and worry about what I didn't turn in<RAISED FIST>
Gotta do what you gotta do lmfao.
Sometimes I just lay here and wonder what's my purpose.
@papa_layne yes I know I know<RELIEVED FACE>
@papa_layne I hate that class and it so boring and the teacher is Coleman from Smyrna I just hate it<WEARY FACE>
If there was one class I could drop it would u.s. government in a heartbeat..
There's never a dull moment when im with my bestfriend <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Seeing people get out of relationships and downgrade confuses me <FROG FACE><HOT BEVERAGE>Ô∏è
More fake friends my senior year than I could have ever imagined but it is what it is.
@LindsayHerndon is fake
It was good seeing my boy @CjrDavidson today long time no see proud of you and all of your accomplishments keep grinding<RAISED FIST>
My "friends" ain't shit.
Hope you've had a good birthday love you big brah<BLUE HEART> @mo_tuff 
Wouldn't have made it through this day without @LindsayHerndon keeping me busy I love you<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
It's gonna be a long day<PENSIVE FACE>
Happy 19th Birthday JoJo fly high buddy Smyrna misses more than words can say.
Happy 19th birthday JoJo we all love and miss you so much we know 15yrs on this earth wasn't much‚Ä¶ 
Johnny Paul just tried to talk bad to me but that's a story for another day<GRIMACING FACE>
Everybody has a stress reliever.
Never change for anybody!
I can't deal with my friends that are boy crazy it gets annoying af real quick<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Just know it is what it is<PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL>
Bad thoughts
Putting my foot down.
Where do I start..
Not wasting this day in the house.
So I fr have on shorts today im loving this weather<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
5yr old brothers quote of the day: "yayo all I know is yayo"
I need plans on this beautiful day.
Real Recognize Real.
It's too early for a migraine.
Tired of everything.
I rather pay bills on my own than live under my moms roof for another year.
Im better off on my own anyways.
@jes_000x haha wish I was tweeting that..<UNAMUSED FACE>
I just hate waking up in this house.
<PENSIVE FACE><THOUGHT BALLOON>
It's as clear as it gets that i'm wasting my time on the wrong people.
No matter what you say your actions bring out the true colors in you at the end of the day.
Its been a good night<OK HAND SIGN>
I need to stop stressing over things I have no control over.
People be so awkward when you walk by them in the hallways.
I've fallen asleep every class period so far it must be this rain..
Can't change anything at this point so it's time to just go with the flow.
Tired
Why lower your standards for a low life.
Sneaky people I just don't get.
Why can't people just be straight up these days like it's not that hard it saves so much tension.
I always put two and two together and figure out everything.
These past 3 days have been nothing but challenging and awesome.
The one way you can help yourself is first by stepping out of your comfort zone.
It just kinda scares me that I don't know what I'll be doing with my life in 5 months from now..
Wouldn't have wanted to spend this day any other way than the way I did.
Beyond stressed.
I'll stand with arms high and heart abandoned in awe of the one who gave it all i'll stand my soul lord to you surrender all I am is yours<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I guess it's time for me to step back.
Some things just annoy me more than other things
I love having encouraging friends in my life it helps me out more than they know.
When you care for someone more than they deserve you get hurt more than you deserve.
Wait why is my mom having a party tonight just for this empire show..
Mom just made empire cup cakes for tonight<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Trying not to let my anger get the best of me today.
I'm really not feeling this day.
I'm beyond done with school.
You don't need me.
I guess your busy af<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Just thinking about all the moments we took for granted that we'll never get back.
Keeping everything to myself is killing me.
I see where I stand.
Every little thing that crosses my mind is just making me feel sick to my stomach tonight.
Not stressing it.
Got bigger things to worry about than you.
@kirstynnnnn love you!!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Missing this face<RELIEVED FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
Just makes me sad and killing me seeing you like this but I know I have to be here for you and I won't fail.
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal.
Don't take what you have for granted.
I can't complain.
@LindsayHerndon im not going nowhere linds <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
You give me reasons to stay around.

@YO_CRIPS your cut off but goodnight bae<FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
When I tell someone goodnight I expect one back..

Congratulations on the offer keep putting in work<AMERICAN FOOTBALL> @the_primetime17

<WEARY FACE><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I'm tired of coming home after school with a migraine and having to sleep just for it to go away..
Just woke up from the best nap<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
God will wreck your plans when he sees that your plans are about to wreck you.
It's 50 shades of HOT outside.
I will praise you in this storm.
Nothing upsets me more then seeing someone I care so much about going through it..
I just want to hear you tell me you'll be okay<PENSIVE FACE>
The people you think have a perfect life and wouldn't expect to be going through anything in life I promise you they are.
Just lost my whole appetite..
It gets old when you realize your always the only one putting in all the effort.
One year later and people are still hating on the chacos<SLEEPING FACE>
People come and go it's part of life.
People think they doing something thinking their slick haha noooo your not not at all I know everything believe it or not my friend!<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But when it's over they try to be buddy buddy with you get on with all that<RAISED HAND>
It's funny how people change when they get in a relationship <HOT BEVERAGE>Ô∏è<FROG FACE>

I love having heart to heart conversations with the ones im close with.
Don't you hate when someone tries to talk bad to you then think everything will be okay in an hour well yeah it's not..

Whomever said your teenage years would be the best years of your life absolutely lied.
Should have went out tonight.
Better is one day in your courts
Better is one day in your house
Better is one day in your courts
Than thousands elsewhere.<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Just wish I could roll over and go to sleep..
Seems like lately I keep on getting these signs that remind me that life is too short and it can never be paused or rewinded.
Done with that double texting.
I'll put in as much effort as you put in.
I'm always going out of my way for the wrong people smh.
Watch how people act when they are around those certain people.
One thing ive always wanted growing up in life was that father figure in my life.
Tonight would be a good night to go downtown.
Gotta keep everything off my mind.
It's been a long day for sure.
That was a fake move.
I just realized it was Friday the 13th..
I hate when my mom reads my messages but doesn't respond.
Really trying to leave early today.

Wonder how the world would be if everyone was the same color since the color of our skin matters so much.
Can't slack on these last 9 weeks.

@Michaeltdm13 that's true though<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL> I guess I gotta be more open minded when it comes to situations like this though
@Michaeltdm13 like there's just some things you don't say just because you never know when you'll come across the wrong person.
@Michaeltdm13 that's true and that's what I tried to think about but that's straight disrespect!
