The bad news is I didn't destroy my Circuits final... The good news is that half of the class got agitated and turned it in half blank.
Hehe Dubai

You know what would be great for my GPA, meeting a new friend right now and spending the next few days getting to know each other.
A bunch of physics grad students came in to take an exam in the classroom I was in, they offered to let me take it with em.
All the kids on evansdale look strung out and all the kids downtown look dressed up.
The difference between the kids in the evansdale and downtown libraries is insane..

Currently Wondering if any of my grade school teachers expected me to succeed.
Sophomore slump, comeback of the year.
If I fail my finals, well at least I spent a few days listening to good music.

There is a special place in Hell for people like me.. It's between the trash can and the water fountain.

The hardest part of adolescence for me was learning to be optimistic/happy... Glad that shit's over.
Physics always makes sense, until you try and do the math.

I always let hurried individuals cut line for the PRT, then I gawk and buck at their backs to show everyone else how rude I find it. #np
Look at all the lonely people.
“@austin_buskus: People of WV wouldn't survive without government handouts"
Those odd individuals who's sex you can't determine as a passerby.
@AbsentlyAwesome @cassidybayess only communists drink PBR anymore
Is it there a Girls only  book club meeting in the lair right now?
How friendly a world without Cell phones must be.
@johnmeowcool cursed with self awareness, let me retreat to my mind for a bit. Get lit, hit the switch, and rekindle the Mo's flaming shit.
Somedays I feel like shit.  Somedays I want to quit.
Maybe I should've been an accountant
It's a sad day when your friends start dying.
Bobek always refers to them as "beautiful theorems"
So far miller hasn't been able to accurately help anyone in this review session.
You belong, among the wildflowers. You belong, somewhere you feel free.

I need to get a pillow/blanket attachment for my backpack.

Why is there so much traffic right now?
My first @bassnectar experience was phenomenal. #SUGARCUBE #ThankYou

Any athlete who backs McDonald's commercials doesn't really want people to strive to live the healthiest lifestyle possible.

@johnmeowcool haha I'd have chosen pot over those two when I was in Highschool anyway.
@johnmeowcool do they kick you out of school if you do drugs? Thereby crippling your chances in society?
Maybe we just pick something that fascinates us.
Do we just pick a major we think we may like and stick with it until we get that piece of paper? Or do we pick something we are good at?
Everyone looked at me weird when I tried to break the trail silence on the PRT with friendly conversation.
Makes me happy when I see little pieces of me in others.
Keep thinking of that Book I once saw in Mrs. Parks's room called, "God created the integers"....Pretty sure Egyptians created the integers.
I get the grungiest drops stuck in my head at random. #BassMind
Bout to learn the math behind the lines on topographic maps.
This morning out physics professor touched on how we should be more worried about climate change than Ebola. #Truuuuuuu
I can't wait until people quit wearing this Macklemore haircut
Never understood why people hung out in the lair. Then again, I've always lived downtown.
@johnmeowcool nah caffeine isn't detrimental to my health, nicotine is detrimental to yours. #FuckYoCigs
Calc3 is the easiest class I've had in a long time.... #NoJoke
Is it an addiction if it Is beneficial to my mental health and doesn't inhibit my physical well being?

I need sushi and coffee.
I can drink alcohol and solve a problem. But if I smoke bud I can't even remember what the problem is asking. #seriouslyTho
Beer and math get along so much better than weed and math.
Oh how I look forward to swim class at 3.
@johnmeowcool I wish these classes would curve.
Maybe I should just be a math major.
How can I like calculus so much and absolutely hate physics and programming?
I have a test in an hour, unfortunately all I have to drink is Miller.
I try to have a beer before every calculus test.
Honey badger doesn't give a fuck.
#GoTime
I need a shower, an IV full of espresso, &amp; more than anything, a supreme knowledge of polyatomic ions, solubility rules, and net ionic EQ's.
Cell phones make me hate the people who ride the PRT.
I wanna give a shoutout to @RickieC for having the baddest math teacher in all the land. #LuckyFucker #BlackBeauty
Was the curriculum in college easier or more difficult when our parents went thru?
God, I hate Jesus freaks.
@TheRayRay75 how fuckin backwoods
If you waste my time then FUCK YOU.
Just saw an integrated communications class. I doubt anyone in communications knows how to integrate.

The more you talk, the dumber you look.
I wish I'd gone through childhood with less toys and my parents would've saved that money for me to have in college.
I easily spend 15$ a week on coffee.
Apparently I like pumpkin spice more than white girls do. <SMIRKING FACE>
Math 251 is exponentially easier than Phys 111.
Why homecoming is a thing in college baffles me... It's not like 9/10th's of the student body knows who these Greeks are.
Kinda hate college
I've seen like 7 kids with bruised/cut/swollen faces today. #Wtf
Just woke up to the *thud* of my head hitting the wall as I nodded off in class again. <FLUSHED FACE>
If the United States bombs someone because we don't like their style, is it a terrorist attack?
Of course I stay doing homework on Evansdale until 7 and the PRT is broken as Fuck when I try to get home.
My views on ISIS align with what the great Chris rock once said about Al Qaeda. "I ain't afraid of Al-Qaeda, I'm afraid of Al Cracka".

I hate having to do something a few hours before it is due
I told my boss to please fire me. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
He received the email 5 minutes after the incident. Obviously that bitch need not speed to work if she has time to write hate mail.
Hehe I'd like to give a shout out to the bitch that almost rear ended me today and then emailed my boss saying I didn't use a blinker.
That was me taking a stab at Sgt. Peppers. #LT
Obviously that was a joke, because all I need is love.
I need adderall, cocaine, or both. #HeartAttack
I guarantee that wouldn't go over to well with Americans. Why should others tolerate it?  #LT
We put armed American bases in many countries to "observe and report". What if we had foreign army bases here in the US observing us?
Now ask yourselves, what has the US government done to ISIS's homeland? #LT
You know why the US citizens are afraid of ISIS? Because our government told us to be afraid of ISIS. What has ISIS done to our homeland?
You know why the out citizens are afraid of ISIS? Because the government told us to be afraid of ISIS.. What has ISIS done to our homeland?
It's a social experiment really, because these students will put themselves before me EVERY TIME. No one comments that I was here first.
I show up to the PRT an hour early so I can miss 5 PRT's and observe how rude everyone is for jumping in front of me.
Goodluck getting a good job with your pants around your kneecaps. #LT
College kids who actually think it's cool to sag your pants. I want to kick you in the ass.
@johnmeowcool band is actually my favorite wagon.

But I'll be damned if both big groups of Arabic speaking kids In my Phys111and Calc3 class don't cheat their asses off.  #LT
Someone once told me all these foreign students cheat their way thru college. I though that was the most racist thing I'd ever heard.
I really dislike this girl, and I don't have a legitimate reason.

Morgantown is like the north. The only hospitality you'll receive here is from those from the south.

I'll be so happy when the Pauley shore version of Macklemore's haircut is no longer popular.
Gothic couples always match.
All I can do is talk about these people, because their conversation distracts me from learning about ideas... <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Apparently "Ashley" is a Basic bitch name.
And all these two have done is discussed and belittle those in their social group. #LT
"Small Minds talk about people; Mediocre minds talk about events; Great minds talk about ideas."
This is why you don't find your wifey in the club... #ClubLib
And now the topic of conversation consists of how they are too good to join a sorority... AKA, pretty enough to meet guys without a posse.
Currently the two girls beside me in the library are discussing if, "Ashley should dye her hair red".... They need to GTFO of here.
Caffeine makes me a nicer person

I see three girls walking together and they all have the same purse. #HowBasic
@Nibert34 which scientist proved that?
Rush week.
I think PhD's in English should only be given to those who write a best seller.
This week I learned that the body doesn't really require that much sleep to function
In other countries people work hard AF so one day they can relax. In this country people work hard AF to never have to work.
... What am I saying, God definitely only backs Americans.
If God blesses American troops, does that mean God hates America's enemies?

All these kids who wear headphones and then stare at you while you are talking to someone else need to learn some social skills.
Laying in the sunlight, studying equations of planes and lines. <OK HAND SIGN>
You ever sit down a few hours before an exam to study and then realize you don't know what you're doing?
Sometimes the goal is to look strange, like today
Sleep is temporary, these exam grades are forever.

Dating, it's a real Thot process.
Seems like everyone in the math department wears shorts, flip flops, and button ups.
Haha Seth, such a dork.
This semester I feel like I see at least 3 people I know every day on campus.
Last year it seemed like I didn't really know anyone on campus and the people I did know, I never saw.
Immediately followed by meeting the most boring ROTC kid.
Met the friendliest freshman on the PRT earlier.
Just noticed that I don't think I've ever ridden the PRT with a professor
My student ID is delaminated on 3 sides
@MCPhillyP he's a college touring kinda negro.
Just heard on the radio that they are creating a pumpkin spice condom for this holiday season, time to start cap'n dome.
Bobek went 0/2 on the examples in class today. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
bobek just drew matrices on the board for 30 minutes, realized she fucked the whole thing up, apologized, and decided to move on. <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #math
That wonderful moment when your professor tells you the syllabus is wrong and your exam is the day after it's scheduled.
That wonderful moment when your assignment was graded based on criteria that wasn't displayed until after the assignment was due. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

I need to quit my job at the DA, it isn't what like I was led to believe it is and it's not worth my sanity.

This PRT needs CaKed Up.
PRT = Perfectly Ruining Time
I think that warrants a nap time.
I think dreaming is a way of teaching yourself things in a subliminal, almost fictional, manner.
Can you learn from your dreams?
Is being asleep an active state of consciousness? Can you learn while you are asleep?
That shit cracks me up. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> #LT
