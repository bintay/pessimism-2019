Stop confusing me with your American Mothers' Day! Making me think I've forgotten it but it was aaages ago!
Yes that was a purposefully vague tweet as I can't outright say it on social media XD
Some peoples' laziness astounds me!
Legend! 
On VE Day too you disrespectful idiots.   
Really unimpressed by the lack of seats at this station - need to cater for all abilities as travel is important
@NetworkRailBHM is abysmal at the moment. Why are there no seats on the platform? In agony due to my recently broken foot!
Cocktails! <COCKTAIL GLASS><TROPICAL DRINK><WINE GLASS> 
Happy birthday Katie! Love a free slab o scallops 
Sharing again. So angry.  
@DavidMorris2015 hey David what's your policy on plagiarism? As that's my husbands photo of Hest Bank on your website!
And he's so humble. Gutted for Oliver Coppard. Would have done a much better job!  
@olivercoppard absolutely gutted for you Mr Coppard but will be behind you all the way in 5 years if you run again <GRINNING FACE>
Devastated we're heading toward Tory majority. Feeling incredibly hopeless today.. Worst possible result.
@nick_clegg crikey in Sheffield for the first time in weeks?
@say_shannon don't forget "hell yes I'm tough enough!"
90 minutes to go guys. get to your polling station pronto! We can make a difference #Labour #IVoted
@olivercoppard did you all pop out of that van behind? Hehe
@_ryantk Christ. Get your badge worn with pride and get em told!
Today's the day!! Heading off to cast my vote for @olivercoppard #Labour #BetterForSheffield and better for Britain!!!
Three grades down, three to go for the year. Two firsts and a 2:2. Starting to pull up that poor grade!
The Tories are coming for you AGAIN.
Time to get the #ToriesOutNow 
There needs to be a phone line especially designed for when you find out your friends vote Tory or UKIP and you need to cry
@MsJackMonroe @EverydaySexism Oh thank god! I didn't think my tiny lady brain would have coped with all those words
@BillEllson apologies if that was wrong. Going off a documentary I watched last year, scratching my head trying to remember its name
Churchill likened Bevan to Hitler for proposing a free NHS.. Nothing much has changed they still want it gone.
How can anyone want to vote for the Tories? What track record have they got? They do nothing for anyone but the richest.
It's the only choice! I want an NHS that stays intact, lower tuition fees, new homes, and a higher tax on the richest 
Starting to get so nervous about the election! Honestly don't know how it's going to turn out.
Star Wars Blu Rays are freaking gorgeous!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

What a wedding!!  <BIRTHDAY CAKE><CONFETTI BALL><PARTY POPPER> 
Wedding pink drink 
We loved @peddlerMKT tonight but there seemed to be far fewer places to sit than last time. Not great when recovering from a broken foot!
Remembering the idiot today in the queue saying he voted Tory in the last election cause "Sam Cam is fit". Modern democracy ladies and gents
Help me. 
Now.. time for some housework (almost feels like a treat)!!
Makes me almost grateful for a broken foot, as at least I'm not on placement and can focus on getting this done!!
.. five articles appraised, two to go.. making progress on this beast assignment.
I love my mum anyway, but I love her even more today for being a statistician and being able to explain these journal articles to me!
@StDialsWard fine!!! * not done. Stupid autocorrect
@StDialsWard the owners did this for about 5 seconds for the photo. The puppy is clearly done
Q "is Ed Miliband more left wing in private?" Interesting thought!
They say young people aren't interested in politics <POUTING FACE> most people here are under 30! @OwenJones84
At the Crookes social club for a Q&amp;A with @OwenJones84 and @olivercoppard . 
Make an emergency donation to assist Nepal after their major earthquake 
@Journey4John confused about this comment. In UK this is not true. There is no campus law.
These posters are gorgeous! 
Ed is a hit with this hen party <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@TrixieJHughes perfect! Thank you!
Hey Sheffield anything on tomorrow? We have the day off, no plans and are forecasted good weather. @HelpSheffield
@olivercoppard I'm happy to help after my lectures are done in the afternoon. Could drive people to and from polling stations :)
Can you help on Election Day? #BetterForSheffield 
<POULTRY LEG><FORK AND KNIFE> BBQ with great company! 
Dinner date made by me! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> risotto, baked Camembert, bread and chutney 
@Slvolunteers Hi there. Do you do events that I could come along to find out more about OT placements? Thanks!

Had a great weekend with these chaps 
I smell of popcorn. So much popcorn. No popcorn for a while please.
just spotted @say_shannon in on the guardian facebook page! 
Certainly scope for an OT interested in forensics to provide this role! 
Really enjoyed the debate tonight. Need to find out how to submit a question in the next one! @olivercoppard #BetterForSheffield

Apprentices are paid approx £2.50 an hour and are living well below the poverty line. How can this be justified? #hallamqt
Agree that vocational subjects are vital but so is academia. And no mention of the pay disparity of apprenticeships
A ban on degrees on volcanoes???? #hallamqt
Why is this Nick Clegg stand in waffling on about roads? Nothing to do with the question and the roads are still rubbish in Sheffield.
At the Sheffield Hallam public cross party debate.
We did! 
@LittleKelham we did! Check it out 
Also really looking forward to the local debate tonight!
Carvery with @_ryantk and @Wiggzy123 then bumped into @olivercoppard and now relaxing away from the rain! Great Sunday!! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Buffy musical <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Should I be worried @_ryantk 's poll card came but mine hasn't?
Wonderful day. Visit from ragel1990 , treated myself to new makeup, bunch of flowers and did a load… 
@ThomsonCares hi sorry there isn't no. Hopefully it'll be sorted by next week
It won't get out of my head!!!
Please for the love of all that is holy would @ThomsonHolidays get another hold song. Piano bohemian rhapsody for  15 minutes straight!<POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE>
I thought package holidays were meant to be easy. But no. It's the most stressful holiday booking I've ever made. Ever.
And the never ending @ThomsonHolidays saga continues. They'll be getting an angry letter when/if this all gets sorted
Really productive day. Think I'm solar powered. Whole house cleaned, laundry done, delicious tagine cooked, 900 words of assignment written!
@ahughesnw I found you. Alex Three Tweet
Also can't believe the author @say_shannon is a year younger than me. Currently feeling a total underachiever. <FLUSHED FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Just finished the Mime Order cannot wait to find out what happens next!! Such a great series!!
Our bbq has caused the neighbours to come a running for their laundry. Woops.

Planning what to do with our garden. (I swear I did to a degree in landscape, I just forgot everything) 
So true! @olivercoppard #BetterForSheffield 
@CoopBankUK_help No I didn't I definitely didn't type anything. How long might it take if I had done it as a bill payment?
@CoopBankUK_help I hope I didn't do it as a bill payment by mistake!
@CoopBankUK_help no it's between my coop savings and coop current.
@CoopBankUK_help hello! how long do transfers between savings &amp; current account normally take? I used to find it instant but its 2 days.
Poor sign. Didn't make it through the night! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> @olivercoppard #BetterForSheffield

Got our new @olivercoppard labour sign up in the garden! #hellyesimvotinglabour
Sad that @wagamama_uk have got rid of chilli men and tama rice. Mine and the husbands faves. At least it's both of us that are disappointed!
Ryan and his new tea towel which won't be doing any dish drying with as its the kind of fabric that… 
Who wants to send me a new foot?
Walked out of the hospital on my own two feet. Great feeling 
@socialchainspar when's there gonna be new levels? What's a girl meant to do now they're all completed?
Counting down the minutes until my hospital appointment tomorrow. Can't wait to get my cast off!!
So heartbroken that hart of Dixie has been cancelled and there's only one episode left. Waaaah
Feelin' the love on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon! 
Sorting out stuff for the charity shop. Everything must go!
It's complete #DoubleStandards nipples are just nipples male or female and the sexism extends to even blurring prosthetic female nipples!!
So this needs explaining. How come male nipples are a-ok but breast plate fake nipples have to be blurred? @RuPaulsDragRace @EverydaySexism
If you squint. You can nearly see it. 
@StagecoachYrks it was the 52 from Arundel gate about 30 mins ago. She got on it the wrong way despite asking if it was going to Crookes.
feel @StagecoachYrks owe my friend an apology. Why say the bus is going to Crookes when she asked if its not. Now sea got to get another bus
The longer this insurance nonsense goes on the more worried and ill I feel. I'm terrified I'll do something wrong and void the claim.
@inddfx @_ryantk but this is my point, there obviously isn't financial ruin if the city is thriving like it is..
@inddfx @_ryantk @Ed_Miliband Sheffield is a city with a thriving independent culture.. Never been anywhere like it.
@HelpSheffield they're sold now but thanks for the RT!
@HelpSheffield I have two tickets for sale for placebo at the O2 academy tonight. Please RT?
@johnlewisretail hi I emailed but got no response last week. Do John Lewis fix sewing machines? I have lost my guarantee and it has broke

@SleepyWingsGame they're still not there so I'll message when I'm on my laptop
These are the problems of someone who has now been signed off work for 1 month.
So first you get me addicted to sleepy wings and then you lie to me by not giving me the lives you said I'd get if I connect to Facebook!

Goooooood wife good times
@LizzyNickers cool! Well dinner &amp; quiz in evening? And if they end up coming earlier and it's done you could come to mine first?
@LizzyNickers Friday - Wednesday :D x
@LizzyNickers don't mind graphic. Sounds good I'll watch it when I'm done with house of cards and hart of Dixie! Ps I'm home on Friday x
@LizzyNickers will it make me sad though? I only watch light hearted rubbish atm!
@LizzyNickers I'll check it out once I'm done on other shows I'm watching! :) x
@LizzyNickers if you don't know it's a show it sounds like the dirtiest tweet on earth
@LizzyNickers me and Ryan only just found out this was a TV show. We've debated for a week whether you've been sleeping with cucumbers!

so I cancel the direct debit so my details aren't stored for no reason and now I get arsey letters. But I wasn't paying anyway!!!
Gosh are @npowerhq annoying. Set up direct debit, they never take a penny so Ryan sets up and pays direct debit.
Sewing machine broke and foot is in agony. Rubbish day.
So many skirt patterns which to make with the fabric I got?!
I'm in some kind of sewing magazine induced daze right now. This is why my midori needs to arrive so I can write LISTS in it
And presents from the wonderful lovelykatie111 !! Every single thing is spot on.. Seeds, sweeties,… 
Gorgeous presents from my mama today. Sewing magazines!!!! 
To be fair that was a lot of stairs she really could have done some damage
Maybe Madge needs an OT led falls prevention group?
Woman falling over is substantially more interesting than 100% of modern pop music
@LizzyNickers no she's all mine
@LizzyNickers she's my babe
@LizzyNickers I &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 her forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
@LizzyNickers it's on freaky friday. But no one else seemed to know it was a cover
@LizzyNickers I loved that song. And then couldn't remember why I knew all the words when they did a cover of it
@LizzyNickers it was 5sos "what I like about you" Wikipedia lied to me
@LizzyNickers no it's not them either and I can't remember what the song goes like
@LizzyNickers what's another pop band that teenage girls like?
@LizzyNickers um I can't remember the name. I'll google
@LizzyNickers but they did a cover of a fabulous song I loved when I was approx 13
@LizzyNickers don't make promises you can't keep
@LizzyNickers don't do dem Brits. Didn't even know they were on #loveagoodhashtag
@LizzyNickers p.s. what are you live tweeting about? Use a hashtag for us dummies yo
@LizzyNickers literally the greatest song ever. I think it might actually have been the reason I broke my foot dancing to that

Fantastic new #tattydevine necklace from Ryan for Valentine's Day! Thank you lovely!!!

Happy Valentine's Day to my lovely husband!! Can't wait for pizza with my other fav couple @eroua and… 
So he is always forced to make a choice... Beautiful picture but unable to follow the story? Or not get what you are paying for and hear?

How long will it take you? 
@StagecoachYrks thanks! Just checking I'm not standing here for no reason :)
@StagecoachYrks website says 52 is running as normal but nothing yet come. Towards shef from Hillsborough. Just late?
In love with our new plates/bowls/serving dish. Broke them in with a delicious Sunday dinner. 
I made a thing. I made actual clothing. 
@4Viewers yeah I've already seen most of it! Can't wait for the UK to keep up.
@ongina yes. It's not even a question.
@BipolarBlogger I think the moral is it should be illegal to sell tattoo machines online.. she's lucky to only have a bad tattoo and not HIV
I don't think I've ever seen a show that debates sexism and racism so thoughtfully and thoroughly.
The Good Wife just gets better and better. I want to be Alicia when I grow up!!
It sure is windy again. And it's bin day. No doubt my bin is down the other end of the road by now.
The Good Wife is certainly back with a bang. Hands down the best episode they've ever put out!
Will someone please send me £100 so I can see @JinkxMonsoon and @SHARON_NEEDLES in Manchester??? I neeeeeeeeed to go!!
So I'll be happily snuggled up with my husband!
I don't believe in New Years resolutions but I do think you should start the year as you want to continue :)
Night relaxing after a hard days grafting. Painting our bedroom and work then painting again. So it's kebab and @RuPaulsDragRace
@Helen_OTUK I think it's empowering to discuss your health online. But it worries me too. Online anyone can be an 'expert'.
On the final placement countdown. Cannot believe it's gone so fast and I'm nearly done. Have absolutely loved it!
On my way to see @InspectorMoss in Birmingham. My old stomping grounds!
"Mrs Andrews' Story - what went wrong?" good communication between acute and community staff is essential.
30% decrease in falls on the ward since discharge to assess introduced. But aren't patients just falling at home instead? #shoutshu
Community teams need to see patients within a few hours of their discharge. #shoutshu
Discharge to assess: plan care from the patient's own home as soon as the acute episode is over #shoutshu
The biggest provider of health care is not the NHS, but the family. #shoutshu
The Kings Fund have presented a model to support frail older people putting the patient at the centre. #shoutshu @TheKingsFund
This is the first time Laura has presented her research from her doctorate #shoutshu
Excited for #shout tonight :) will be tweeting throughout.
We've got the festive feeling at number 35!

@nicolafaulkner_ same! It'll all be worth it!
First day of placement!
@_ryantk is a total babe. Come back to this gorgeous bouquet!! 
@helenlisaj I've emailed Maureen to find out if we have those ones specifically.  I hope we do!
@KateAshley_OT I don't know if we have them. I will email Maureen and ask.
OT friends: as a student how can I get ahold of copies of assessments and guidance, particularly MOHOST and OCAIRS?

@BAOTNYRegion I was just wondering if you did anything specific that I should look into? Otherwise I have the go ahead from the committee!
@BAOTNYRegion Hi BAOTNY! I am looking to set up a Twitter for BAOT Trent and I was wondering if you had to go through any official channels?
I can't seem to buy anything without a fault these days. New @WareStyle coat and button falls off within 1 day. For £95 you'd expect better!
Love a landscape encounter! Fantastic work from @LandscapeSheff students in the winter gardens. 
Wedding photos finally up in the bedroom! :D 
First day back from holiday and already so stressed. Catch up on sleep tonight and then tackle it all tomorrow! For now curry and good wife!

After Cornwall and now in Florida I am finally starting to look like I've been in the sun! Yay!
Time for a new laptop. Went from 70% to switching off in 2 minutes. Time start photo upload again.
You know you're too competitive when you're in an argument about the name of a song in a Gilmore girls episode. Get a life Connie.

@lgbthallam Hi, do you have a Facebook or email where I can send you a message?
I love my uni but SHU really needs new posters. What a surprise the nurse is a woman and the engineer is a man on them. @EverydaySexism
Oh captain my captain. RIP.
@eleda_x basically sums it up. It can be incredibly beautiful too.
@eleda_x takes a while to get who everyone is and why you should care but god it's addictive. I read all the books too now I'm obsessed!
It's so great to have the internet. Can finally sort out this list of chores all while watching RuPaul! Oh yeah
@eleda_x enjoy! And don't get attached to ANYONE!
Ryan and Gracie at the Eden project! 
So burned I look like the surface of Mars. I need aloe vera STAT!

Padstow. Rick Stein even owns this view. 
Gorgeous day! Morning in Padstow which was packed to the rafters (if towns had rafters). Followed by… 
Finally here!! Beaut. 
Why rain whyyyyyyy?
@InspectorMoss to match my legs! 
Gonna dip dye my hair for holiday. Blue, turquoise or pink?
But why do @SmokeBBQShef only sell 1/2 pints or 2 pints of beer. Makes no sense! Enjoyed my meal but drinks were a rip off!
Great date night with Ryan, guardians of the galaxy was amazing and tasty dinner!
Best purchase ever! Now to find somewhere to put it/how do I put this on a wall? Happy birthday HP and… 
The place is feeling more cheerful already. Might not look like much but the soil was bone dry and so… 
The smell of cat repellant is repelling me from my own kitchen. Think I need to move the bottle to the shed.
Inclusive design hub for the built environment: how might OTs be involved?  
I'm so glad the men get armour that protects their vital organs but the lady has her stomach exposed! Easy target. 
@plusnet visit by the engineer? We are on holiday then. Is there a number I can call to discuss this as there's confusion.
@plusnet done that. Hope you can find out why for me. it being put back is a major problem for me as we have no internet.
Shedding a tear at RuPauls drag race. Got into it a bit too much. Love @ongina so much!!!
@InspectorMoss hahaha polar bear is going below my knee and the bird is going on my collar bone
@InspectorMoss the bear is by Jody Dawber she's starting tattooing in Liverpool. :D
@InspectorMoss cuties!!!! 
@alishaakelly amaaaaaaazing film. Had me laughing entire way through. In Bruges is also top notch.
Read horrible judgemental @guardian article. Want more tattoos now. Just paid deposit for 2 more.
@alishaakelly looks like a baby version of Robert Downey Jr in 7 psychopaths. Love himmmmmm
@plusnet why does our activation date keep getting put back with no explanation? We're not impressed. 
Seriously @marksandspencer why have you removed the feature to filter swimsuits by length on the mobile app? Already hard enough to be tall!
Lemsip is my best friend
Article on the guardian which mentions a nurse and uses pronoun He. Yet everyone uses her in the comments... Why assume a nurse is female?
Definitely going to get dressed today. Feel inhuman in pyjamas all day. But new indigo jeans + new grey sofa means I will sit on a towel.
Reading articles on obesity and all I can think is god that fry up in the picture looks cracking.
Misleading tweets. He's chief whip now is that better or worse?
Gove is out? Well well well
I love my new house so much! I am so ready to go and get all the rest of our stuff tomorrow! Feeling energetic!
@plusnet yep. I understand and we're used to it. Has happened every time we move house
Internet sorted out for our new house.. but why no engineer appointments for 3 weeks @plusnet seems silly to have to wait that long! :(
Think the excitement of the weekend finally caught up with me. Migraine!
Thanks for sending me beef mince with today's date @sainsburys .. normally doesn't happen. One of the reasons I hate online shopping.
Back to reality now we've checked out our beautiful hotel but at least I have these reminders of the…

Yeh baby! #Playstation4selfie 
I think I feel a bit different too. This year has been amazing!
On train home to Lancaster for a longish visit. Feels like it's been ages and I fully expect everything to look different.
Unbelievably tired. Just want to crawl into bed and sleep forever but I need to get the train to Lancaster!
@BillWongOT have an incredible time! I'm super jealous!
Woken up in agony, what the heck have I done to my neck? If it wasn't for my party tonight I would honestly call in sick.
No uni work means gaming! First up: finish Skyrim
Think it's because I've seen how hard it can make life, and death, be. And I can't picture friends that way without feeling awful.
It always shocks me when I find out someone smokes who I didn't know did. Never fails to.
Working on the wedding playlist again.. 3 weeks to go and I STILL cannot decide what our aisle music is!! STRESSING
Mega zone was the place of my childhood nightmares. A place where athletic children could get even more aggressive. Burn to the ground!
@LizzyNickers sounds best avoided
@LizzyNickers have you seen mcRib?

@COTstudents @Aimee_OT I would also love to. But I would not know how to even start planning one without support
Grim fandango HD remake. Hold me.  
I've broken through.. My feet have gone past agonising to just pure numb. Progress.

Today so far summed up! 
Any recommendations for what to do on Sunday in London?
@colettebeecher1 sounds brill I need to research this :)
@kirstyes I've ended up leaving early myself now to visit a friend in London! It really was an OT army
@BillWongOT sounds great! Hopefully you can see London too as they're close! Would be happy to show you the sights!
@BillWongOT fantastic! Have you visited UK before?
@Aimee_OT yes!! We have also been brainstorming ideas for a poster with @shout_team
@BillWongOT we'd be happy to welcome you! And Brighton is so gorgeous so let's hope for great weather again!
Must be the luckiest person ever. Have been pooed on my a bird AGAIN
OT's are the happiest profession FACT #COT2014 
"I'm an occupational therapist. What's your superpower?" #COT2014
We need to respond confidently that we are OTs when asked what we do! Spread the word of OT #COT2014
Are you listening like this dog? What will the music be. #COT2014 
Sad to hear that Paul Tutton couldn't make the closing plenary but my wishes are with his daughter #COT2014
I'm attending Session 100 – Closing plenary #cot2014

@Tai_the_OT talks about confidence developing through being a scholar &amp; feelings if you can do that you can do anything #COT2014
Great talk on university exchanges. @OT_SHU we need an exchange! It would a fab chance to learn about international perspectives #COT2014
I'm attending Session 69 - Papers #cot2014 
Where might landscape architecture fit in? Would love to hear from landscape architects working in inclusive design #COT2014
There are lots of resources to find best practice guidelines for inclusive housing design #COT2014
Only one set of building regs are mandatory. OTs are needed to ensure that the other guidelines are understood and followed #COT2014
Why are OTs needed in design &amp; build? To build homes which are inclusive, do not need adapting later. Removing barriers for living #COT2014
Marney Walker says it's vital to tackle perceptions of OT and clarify expectations of colleagues as a lone OT in a housing team #COT2014
I'm attending 62 - Before and after the drawing board: establishing the role of an OT in the design and... #cot2014

@kirstyes good luck. Gutted I'm missing your talk. #COT2014
Meaningful occupation gives people the opportunity to express their gender identity #COT2014
NHS (2008) admit they have contributed to anguish and distress of transgender people through gossiping and denying treatment #COT2014
Gender is not a biological trait but a social construct. Research has shown OTs base their interventions on gender stereotypes #COT2014
A delegate asks maybe we do not approach sex with clients as we see them as asexual beings? And so shy away from the topic. #COT2014
Amy Parkin: we should lobby @BAOTCOT to have sex recognised as an ADL as @AOTAInc do.
@OT_rach really brilliant point. I still struggle to think how to phrase it. Need a clear response at the ready. #COT2014
87% OTs surveyed said sex was a valid domain for OT. #COT2014
Why are we not approaching the subject of sex when it is so important to our clients? Asks Amy Parkin #COT2014
Hearing about burns and sexuality/body image for women with Kylie Connell. #COT2014

“@EarthPix: Infinity Pool, Bali 
@InspectorMoss forever withdrawing £30 just to make sure I have a 10

SEX WITH DISABILITIES? The fabulous Laci Green discussing sex and disability. Give it a watch!  
Fun night at work having to be in the screens to listen out for sound from the band next door. Got to enjoy lots of Charlie Chaplin!
@CharlieF_Tour sounds wonderful but I have no time off work to go <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> any chance it will tour again?

@NFUtweets @OurCowMolly already entered! Fingers crossed. Yum yum
@OurCowMolly @tommy_markham @NFUtweets

@NFUtweets @OurCowMolly id love to make something like chocolate and black currant :D
@tommy_markham @NFUtweets @OurCowMolly Mmm salted caramel is heaven.
Totally in love with my new sunglasses. Now the sun needs to show her face so I can wear them!!! 
@InspectorMoss yeah that is absurd. Like I say I don't get it as every pair I've had last for years x
These are my two pairs I've had for over a year and wear nearly daily! You must have got a total dud @InspectorMoss 
@InspectorMoss :( stupid vans. Mine normally withstand everything. Even when the sink in the bar flooded on shift and it was everywhere!
@InspectorMoss mine always hold up really well when it's wet! Crazy Katie's vans!
@WhitesFineFood heard nothing but fabulous reviews of them. :D
@WhitesFineFood 50s rock n roll? 
Glad that @_ryantk liked @theworkstation today! And got to see the roof garden (jealous). As if he's going to be working next door to me! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@katyvwalker these look AMAZING! Wish I knew about them sooner!! Our wedding is in 6 weeks!
If you need me I'm off having adventures with shadow hunters. See you on the other side. @cassieclare
Don't even know why I'm bothering to go swimming may as well lay in a puddle.
So difficult to get out of bed this morning. And has been made even worse due to the rain and I ran out of cereal <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@lainitaylor I am so jealous!! Knew it would be up your street! Hoping to go back next year :)
All of @lainitaylor 's photos of Paris are making me very jealous and wanting to return. Can imagine Laini liking musee des arts Forains!
Absurdly warm in this room. And my legs are like jelly from starting the 30 day squat challenge! Time… 
Essay down! Celebrating with favourite dinner as telly with @_ryantk steak and pasta mmmmm
Favourite! #occupationaltherapy 
Resumed house of cards season 2 what the heck is going on??
Going to try Zumba tomorrow. Genuinely terrified of going but determined to try it.
@KateAshley_OT Mmm yes! I wonder if their menu is the same or different!
well I've managed 1500 words of what I'm sure is gibberish..
Do not know why I just cannot get my brain into gear for this neuro assignment.
Starting to have real ceremony music panics. Why is all music me and @_ryantk like either far too melancholy or far too angsty???
@Eroua thank you. I literally made it to the bathroom by a second. Tucking up now :(
Come home sick from work :( didn't think I was gonna make it home in that taxi. Blerghhhh
@Eroua I can't wait! Third time seeing her!
On my way to see Katy Perry!!! :D
Trying to browse the fantasy/sci if section in peace. Woman won't bloody shut up about fussy book covers at top of her voice. Go away.
@Wiggzy123 what you doing??
@alexhughes_ you Derp stick
Every so often I remember I'm going back to Florida to Harry Potter world and I just have to scream and dance around a bit
@Lovelettersne hi what is your website please? The link in your bio does my work x
Have a feeling the next 3 weeks are going to an absolutely insane rush of business
Every vote counts in the Euro Elections. 
You can elect more Green MEPs.

Just cast my votes for European and local elections! #GreenParty
Do you think this is accessible? 
@nicolafaulkner_ argh I can't deal with that. my whole hen night is a surprise! Eek!
trying to find your work colleagues on Facebook should be considered an Olympic sport. Impossible
Movie night: kill your darlings and August: Osage county. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@millymather @KateAshley_OT Clearly you've both found the men for you!! What are you waiting for????
I feel so uncomfortable when I see loads of make-up on small children. So creepy.
Making my wedding dance playlist based entirely upon 00's indie disco music. ahhh so many memories coming back.
Enjoying the sun in kelham island! 
Stolen pic from @francesjoyce89  thank you so much for today!!! He's fab! @ Modern Body Art 
Another sneak peek! 
Little preview sent on from our engagement shoot :D 
@TheMilestone @MilestoneGrown where is this located? Love it!!!!
And we got pooped on by a bird. Gross. But must be a sign from somewhere that we're going to have a good marriage!
So much fun at our engagement shoot tonight. Such amazing weather for it. Can't wait to see pics..
@DiverseOT @AOTAInc woop I've been recognised!! I must be famous now :D it's a fab project. Watch this space!
New hair feeling snazzy
Absolutely gutted there's no places left at @bronteot session at @BAOTCOT conference :( :(
Ate some cake. Big mistake. <SHORTCAKE><ASTONISHED FACE><ASTONISHED FACE>
If everyone could report @ocdporn that would actually be fab. Let's beat the bullies they think making fun of mental illness is a good idea!
@CeinwenF I've reported it but do the same. The more reports they receive the more seriously twitter will take us
@georgina_557 fab letter. So well written. I think they must take it seriously. X
@georgina_557 @OCDPorn glad to hear it, I've also reported them to Twitter explaining why it should be removed. #stigma
@couchcoffee what number Ecclesall Road are you please?
Angered by @OCDPorn page bio. Clearly have no understanding about the daily reality of living with OCD and what it really means! Sickening
@georgina_557 have you seen the page @OCDPorn . I'm feeling really sickened by it. Making jokes out of a serious condition
@millymather @AshleeColes @Laurenjade_1994 @KateAshley_OT @HelenePayiatis CAN I COME PLAY TOO PLEASE?
Fab chat with Amy Wagenfeld today about what I could spend bursary money on! Watch this space!!!!
My first magazine article! 
Wow! Awesome seeing me and Amy featured in @AOTAInc OT Practice magazine for our work with @InclusiveplayUK 
I'm not quite sure what happened today at uni 
Doing this to death at college has really helped this lecture - would be going too fast otherwise! 
So excited for Birmingham on Saturday @ModernBodyArtUK @InspectorMoss 
So that was the final @shout_team talk of the season! Time to get booking in some brilliant speakers for next year!
Thanks for the follow @MAIDinclusively - I find the work that you do fascinating. Interested to hear more about the Msc in the future
Attendees attempt to tie their hair back with only one hand @shout_team @ConsultantsOT 
@AshleeColes attempts to tie her shoelace with just one hand to simulate loss of function. Tricky!  @shout_team 
Amazing shout tonight on brachial plexus injury. Inspired! @shout_team @ConsultantsOT
Literally don't know what I'd do without them and their support &lt;3
Well it's official. The only members of my entire family attending my wedding are my parents. I'm so grateful I have them it's unreal.
Unwinding after that shift :) got to get that occupational balance! XD
@SallyOHal hi Sally it's Connie from showroom. Thought I'd give you a follow - did my previous degree in landscape architecture! :D
Cake and hot chocolate with my ladies @KateAshley_86 kaydeeleeh 
@FoxStagg not yet no. I used to volunteer with children with complex learning disability so would love a paeds placement!
Meal out with my group 5 girls! #nandoseccyroad free wings ooooh yeah!
Feel like there's something I have forgotten to do... Hoping to wake up refreshed and ready in the morning!
@KateAshley_OT going to Birmingham this weekend :( but another time yes!
@KateAshley_OT do you fancy trying @couchcoffee sometime? Looks yum! 
"Stories don't need to be new to bring you joy. Some stories are like familiar friends. Some are as dependable as bread"
Email shout.event@gmail.com for a ticket for our next shout event with @ConsultantsOT on brachical plexus injury. £2 students £3 non student

Forging links: How can occupational therapists inform landscape architecture? 
The Wind Rises was utterly fantastic - sweeping, epic, enchanting and heartbreaking. One of Studio Ghibli's finest I must say!
@alishaakelly because it is the greatest thing ever? (unless its 1-3, in which case it's shit)
@alishaakelly  XD Might put people off visiting it!!
I don’t say! 
@LizzyNickers my sweet cheesecake
Starting a blog on wordpress about OT/landscape architecture/inclusive design. name suggestions?
@LizzyNickers grandma grandma BANG THE DRUM
@LizzyNickers 
@LizzyNickers 
Perfect weekend continuing with roast chicken followed by the Wind Rises with @_ryantk
@KateAshley_OT I know I think I might collapse. It's because it's so busy everyone has to just muck in!
@KateAshley_OT you should! I can't get ticks for any docfest stuff and I'm working 44 hours over that week of it!!! <PENSIVE FACE>
@KateAshley_OT  yes yes yes!!!! :D
Wedding photo! 
Supporting Austria tonight! 
Eurovision party! Living the dream!
@thisisbwright sounds awful!
Trip to Bakewell with @_ryantk today for lots of eating and relaxing in tea shops :D
LAOT = my new way of saying landscape architecture meets occupational therapy. #LAOT
Fascinating article. Certainly going to have to get in touch about this area of work! #LAOT 
one of the things I'm most excited for at my wedding is seeing all my friends in posh frocks &amp; suits!!
Words are not just words: "Words are displays of attitude and beliefs that permeate our society" - from you don't say? campaign
Anyone that uses words like faggot or tranny or says 'that's so gay' actually just needs to remove themselves from my life <POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE>
Who invites themselves to someone's wedding? Seriously who does that!?!?
I swear my body hates me. I got hungry the moment I brushed my teeth!
@SoonToBeOT oh my gosh your profile pic is brilliant :-D love it!!!!
@FoxStagg good luck!!! Let us know how you find it!
Repost off @lizzynickers because I am in love with this. Gorgeous bridesmaid outfit I can't wait until… 
Fascinating sounding project. #autism #landscapearchitecture #occupationaltherapy #inclusive  
@bronteot 100% agree. Believe she is beginning new job at Rush university soon so hopefully a possibility for further research in this area
@bronteot I know Amy well! Regularly skype with her :) do you know her? Small world
@bronteot looks brilliant! Think an MSc from there or similar must be a step for me in the future. Miss my landscape architecture days!
@bronteot thanks for the tweets tonight! As a former architecture student your research sounds really interesting into inclusive design!
Feeling really nostalgic for my landscape architecture times. Hope I get to do more with it in my career with OT!
Honeymoon research 
Reading is just about the only thing that stops me being grumpy. And @PatrickRothfuss is so good that it's doubly effective today!
@GillyGorry algebraic!!! I &lt;3 adventure time!
Off to Manchester today!! 
I'm batman! 
@georgina_557 absolutely loved your blog post about OCD &amp; shared to my Facebook - many I know could do with reading it! :)
It's 8.30 and Ryan is working hard so I'm going to get the PJs on crack on with my book which I'm enjoying so much! #rockandroll
Who wants to come play? 
@LizzyNickers just report on crap so we don't know about the real things we should be scared of.. Ie. not Muslims and halal.
@LizzyNickers yeah wars in countries barely far from us and a government tearing us apart! But the fail don't care about these things!
@LizzyNickers oops no not the Aston one, but one in Brum definitely was that I went to lots. And the one near me already is.
@LizzyNickers hahah so silly - do they not realise there's ALREADY loads of halal subways? That one at Aston uni was &amp; that was 5 years ago?
@LizzyNickers I can't work out where that photo is? is it to the right as you walk in? Looks really snazzy! Is Lancaster subway going halal?
Complaint to @asda sent. Would expect delivered food to have more than 1 days date on it!
@LizzyNickers what the heck! :S
My kind of guide book. Introduction all about alchemical symbolism in the city! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@kirstyes yeah I heard Tim Burton is linked to it which I have mixed feelings about. Love his older stuff. Recently I've been unimpressed!
@kirstyes love this book! Need to read the sequel. It's on my list :)
Loved listening to @lainitaylor @Waterstones tonight. Shame I couldn't stay for signing. Had to run for my train home!
In worried @lainitaylor thinks I'm stalking her after sitting behind her on the train here &amp; not saying anything! Excited for this event :)
@KateAshley_86 really does. I also want to go to the cinema. Hope it clears up by tonight
48% through dreams of gods and monsters... Need to get a move on before tomorrow! Good job I have a day off! @lainitaylor
@KateAshley_86 I really need to go buy my dad a birthday present.... Think it can wait until Sunday though!
Found this guy in the bin store today! why would you chuck him out? Checked him over and he's spotless… 
@InspectorMoss but I don't know anything by them haha. Sounds good though!
Really should hoover, really should go swimming.. really just want to lay on the sofa for all eternity!! Maybe I'll go tomorrow morning....
Today is the day! Anatomy viva!!!
New bedding and pyjamas! Tonight is going to be so comfy and cosy &lt;3 
New bedding and new pyjamas. Tonight is going to be so comfy and cosy! 
Honeymoon planning! 
Too much birthday shopping to do! Stop all having May birthdays please
@realjohngreen @sportswithjohn gooooooo Chelsea!
@Waterstones @lainitaylor @HodderBooks looking forward to the Nottingham one next week a lot!
... Ignoring a real problem that exists for people and helps to contribute to that prejudice through ignorance.
Especially in the light of the abuse and prejudice that homosexual people face even today. To suggest it's an easier option is...
Do people not realise you cannot pick and choose your sexuality? By saying things like 'maybe I'll just go gay' is insulting to others.
Cooking a curry and wondering if there'll be any @OTCurry nights in Sheffield or nearby? Would love the chance to meet OTs and share food!
Really want to visit Vietnam! Researching all the places I'd love to see!
Another day. Another article that makes my blood boil #stigma #ocd #mentalhealth 
finished Name of The Wind: The Kingkiller Chonicle: Book 1 by Patrick Rothfuss and gave it 5 stars 
@_ryantk @PatTheNESpunk Ahhh I love them just wanna lay among them :D
Can't even express how much I don't want to do today's course. All day on the "principles of customer service!!!"
I have no energy for work today. Think I'll just make a drip from the coffee machine into my arm
Going to be going over today's #otalk for @BAOTCOT conference Brighton. As a first timer I'm getting ready to take it all in!
@_beckyOT doing her thing! #OTradicals @shout_team 
@millymather could have had an OT date at tonight's SHOUT. It would have been hot!
Fantastic talk tonight from @_beckyOT for @shout_team  learned all about #OTradicals
Wedding make up trial tomorrow getting ideas! 
"cancer teenager" is a foul way to describe a young woman who has cancer. I'm ashamed of you @MetroUK 
@InspectorMoss :( bloody nightmare
@InspectorMoss not just any Sunday morning either. Bloody Easter Sunday! I wish I had an Easter egg
Booked this foxy design for my leg off @francesjoyce89 and I'm so excited! Also meeting the lady… 
Everywhere I turn I see derogatory slang - whether it's to do with gender, disability or race. When will people learn?
Absolutely despicable. As a country we preach about human rights which we don't even uphold ourselves 
Absolutely in my top 5 episodes of thrones! Nailed it!
@katylou89  you might wanna change your password... you crazy spammer!
And books and dresses.
I wish I could buy 1950s Swedish everything. It's safe to say if I won the lottery it would go on travel, ceramics and jewellery
@AmzOT found perfect job in Leeds MH rotation for graduates included eating disorders, in patients, community, forensic, all sorts!
Looking at OT jobs! Please can I just be qualified now?? I love being a student but I can't wait to be an OT everyday!!!!
How do some people think you can use positive thinking/willpower to stop being depressed? NEVER READ THE COMMENTS SECTION CONNIE!!!!
@kirstyes it's amazing! When I went last time I actually cried. It was embarrassing.
@BillWongOT @kirstyes Orlando! Harry potter world here I come. Hoping for a trip to Miami too
@kirstyes yes! Visiting my friends there too who work for Disney. Can't wait to get back on the roller coasters and for diagon alley!
@kirstyes Im going to Florida in September too I totally chose the wrong time to go. Well I couldn't afford July anyway! XD
@kirstyes no I mean her friend had a spare so she gets to go for free. Wish I was! Missed it in London too as couldn't get time off :(
@kirstyes me too! My friend is going for free as she just moved to Florida and a friend had a spare. So jealous!
Adverts sent off to the uni for our upcoming @shout_team events. Looking forward to @_beckyOT speaking and then Mona Eklund &amp; team in May!
The box said it came with 4 flakes, who's laughing now?!! 
Back from a long day at the hospital! Fed, watered, relaxed
Really intrigued to know how OT works in the USA and health insurance. Surely not all people have access to OT who may need it?
Lots of AOTA people doing conference stuff on my twitter! Making excited for @BAOTCOT conference in June! :D excited for learning!
@kirstyes @shout_team we're attending this year too so hopefully lots more great pieces will be written :D
“@CrapTaxidermy: "Sorry to disturb you guys but I think somebody took a shit on the carpet." 
@_beckyOT yes please! I emailed you as well before in a panic :s thank you x
@_beckyOT hi Becky. Think I've got confused when arranging next shout talk. Please can you confirm the date and title of talk? Thanks!
Real life pokemon catching! 
Wish I was at home watching the demon headmaster not working
Yes. Those are definitely the correct details. Well done. 
Paper towns is going to be a film :D
@KateAshley_86 lol yeah! Just my favourite character in a tv show was killed off unexpectedly! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Actually just sat in shock
Oh my gosh. Will! How could they???? #TheGoodWife
Just posted a photo 
Another. Because why not ? 
Wedding dress and shoes sneak peak! Now who wants to come round and lace me into this thing? Turns out… 
Nap of kings. Refreshed!
@Eroua I can work out from this where you are but I say now don't get one from there! They scarred me bad! Go to evolve :)
#nomakeupselfie because Katie told me to. I think people find all sorts of things to do to encourage… 
Oh scrummy beautiful ice cream bag. I love you 
First Journal Club meeting set up by @OT_SHU BSc 1st years was a great success and there will be many more to come!
One interview down, one to go!! Trial tomorrow for the first one to see how I am. Off to the farm!
Free cake samples must be the ONLY way to eat cake. Yum!!!!! Now which to choose??? #100happydays 
Tonight's @shout_team talk was so inspiring! Lots to think about in terms of leadership and spreading the word of OT!
Such an annoying moment when you read a name and just CANNOT figure out where/when you have heard it before!
@_beckyOT Hi Becky, I'm from @shout_team and hoping to please get a bio about you for your upcoming talk. Could you DM me so we can arrange?
#100happydays

Because there's a raccoon and tree hero. So that's fine the female lead gets naked for no reason in the trailer.
A new film! Starring the beefy muscle man hero, the sexy, sultry lady hero.. But reinforcing these unrealistic gender stereotypes is ok....
The countdown to season 4 begins! #100happydays #gameofthrones

Great day spent with the community stroke service. Loved learning more about the stroke pathway!

Game of thrones marathon needs to start once placement is done! Who's with me??!
Finally changed Chrome spell checker to UK English. Ahhh relief. Recognise, programme, oestrogen. Just testing.
Really hate being told I'm mean when someone ASKED me to explain why I'm an atheist! :(
Even though they are medical doctors. They still give the impression that their most important quality, their value, is from their looks!
Even House MD. A show that is otherwise smart and sassy still patters to sexist 'norms'. Why are all the female doctors tops so low cut?
You know there's something up with toy manufacturers when even 7 year olds are calling them sexist! Get it sorted!
Charlotte got it right! You go girl!! I love Lego too but I couldn't agree with you more! 
Visited kelham island today to look at the venue again. Roll on July! 
@LizzyNickers yarp sure is! Miss you xxxx
@LizzyNickers it really does that's not even close. It's where Ben rose lives and is like 300 miles away!

@LizzyNickers it looks better that way! Super smart and lovely xxx
@LizzyNickers so much love for the do you one hot mama xxx
I have rage for Ms Rowling at present. And that's something I NEVER thought I'd have.
@kirstyes @Patrick_Ness hehe I'm with Mr Ness on that. I try my hardest but I'm so slow!
Still to this day I consider the cancellation of Veronica Mars a crime close to murder
 
Oldie but goodie explaining the #inequality of TV access. TV is essential for most peoples leisure  
How can people enjoy television without the subtitles and audio description quality and availability improving! Where's the equality?
Even though that #SubtitleFail is hilarious.. Services for hard of hearing and vision impaired REALLY needs to improve!

Parents come to visit me. Within 30 minutes they've broken my printer and fallen out with each other and me. Wahey.
My new phone baffles me. Why does it keep beeping then when I look there's nothing there! What do you want from me???
@InspectorMoss other day I saw someone driving while smoking and on phone with kid in the backseat with no seat belt. I was beyond shocked
Couldn't sleep so been research volunteering opportunities for when placement is finished with @BritishRedCross
Unless you have an OCD diagnosis don't use the term OCD to describe your actions. What you mean is you're fussy. #mentalhealth #stigma
@InspectorMoss sounds like a weirdo! Who changes their mind that fast? I'm watching Rushmore
I'm back to work tomorrow. I hate being ill it makes me feel useless and thats something important to remember in #OT #vocationalrehab
Tried to complete placement study work; failed to complete placement study work. Crawling back to the sofa now to let me illness take over.
Policing the online activity of depressed teenagers will not eradicate the cause of suicide: mental illness

"We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving." J.K.Rowling
Time to begin house hunting again. Viewing booked for Sunday. *fingers crossed*
Clearer standards are needed! #autism  
Yes! What's the point of having workers if you push them too far then can't work! Work/life balance  
I'm starting to get very panicky every time I remember my wedding is less than 6 months away
Finding my assignment feedback really frustrating. Being told to discuss areas more when I was at the upper word limit. So tricky!
@LizzyNickers nice! :D I really want microdermals doing!
@LizzyNickers looks awesome! Next time we're together shall we got get pierced?
Huge Facebook debates going on about mental health services in the UK. Always disheartening to hear about negative experiences.
@GillyGorry strong thumbs for tweeting on the go!
Amazing day! Great feedback from my educator during supervision and very happy with a first on my latest assignment :D
Just received a very intriguing email from Amy Wagenfeld who spoke at the @OT24Vx about landscape architecture and OT. Watch this space!
The view on the train between Manchester and Sheffield is one of my favourites! 
On my way to see my mum in Manchester! Can't wait for a good catch up and family time :)
@kirstyes I highly recommend!
@jordybuzz such a fantastic film! I love Jennifer Lawrence she's flawless
@Wardmans if I'm ever so inclined I might get an online portfolio going. Where do you study OT?
@kirstyes it's really a good read. Still need to finish the prequel. I'm glued into the 'wool' series at the moment. Yeah I'm HP mad!
@kirstyes ...heck yes! All of these! And the maze runner! And for books don't even get me started! It's going to be a great year!
@Wardmans same! I hated being trapped at a PC. As a lot of my design work had been 'disability' focused it seemed a natural move to me :)
@kirstyes this is how I track time. By counting down movies and books. Except I didn't enjoy the last in the divergent series :(
@Divergent @kirstyes I can't wait for this film!
@GeekyOT @BPDFFS @IamCarrieeeeee @pd2ot looks so much fun! Enjoy!!
@Wardmans I'm gonna guess landscape architecture????
@jordybuzz sometimes it's needed! I moved back for two years myself glad to be in Sheffield though now. Good luck in the job!
@jordybuzz ooh brilliant :) did you study at Cumbria then? I'm at Sheffield Hallam. Yeah placement is amazing so far!
@jordybuzz awesome! Im absolutely loving it so far yeah just on placement acute stroke! Where do you live these days?
@jordybuzz yeah I do remember! Didn't know you were an OT! Are you working? I'm a first year student doing my second degree :)
Tweeting from my new iPhone 5S! I'm so impressed with how speedy it is. Expect lots more tweets from me now!
So happy it's the weekend! Time to upgrade my phone and collect my new shoes :)
@OT_rach this is something my placement department is currently setting up. They have a list I can try and get/find out info
@EilleenMadore1 That is absolutely abhorrent - thank you for posting. What can we do to help?
If you're a carer/parent of someone with Down's take a look at this 
@Mental_Health_B @MindCharity Amything by David Bowie makes me feel awesome!
Great day on placement today - getting the hang of writing patient notes and getting great feedback from my educator!
Became a member of @MindCharity this week. If you want to support them but are unemployed there's a lower rate. Check it out!
Fantastic talk from @GeekyOT for @shout_team tonight! Feeling really inspired to use social media for my CPD! 
Stay safe in the weather today! Already seen one friend's car being swept out by the sea at Morecambe Bay today!
1st draft of assignment written - just need to ponder the third point of my action plan.. always so difficult to narrow it down. #reflection

Must conquer online training in information governance and student health and safety today!
@DiverseOT I want to watch more but I have work super early in the morning and it's already 10pm for me. going to be catching up later on.
Anyone else studied #landscapearchitecture and #OT? #OTVx13 @OT24Vx

Really thought provoking talk on therapeutic gardens @OT24Vx. giving me lots of ideas of how to use my landscape architecture degree with OT
