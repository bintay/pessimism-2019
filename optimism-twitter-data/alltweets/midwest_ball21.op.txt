I believe in chivalry
I hate that I like you and that you don't give a shit about me
I have more luck with bartenders than any other girl
My views and beliefs are different than 99% of my followers. I like the city and suburbs. I don't hunt. I'm a Democrat. Deal with it.
I've ate dinner once in the last week and a half. Oh well
#KnowYourAnon I haven't grown since 8th grade. Still 5'10"

Selling $250 40" TV's like no other. Make $2.50 a pop
But it wasn't a bad break because I watched Pokemon on my phone. Thank you Netflix

The only Apple products I will buy are their computers. Everything else is too basic and proprietary
@top_bitchxo1 I worked my magic
@top_bitchxo1 truuu
@top_bitchxo1 what's good
Oh, your 16 year old son knows everything about TV's and goes through as much training as I do? 
Working straight commission is a cursing and a blessing

Lacey Waldrop is a cutie
I need food dammit
#oomf should come watch the Pacers/Heat then the Tigers/Red Sox with me
But for real though...
I should delete this. Tweeting cuts into my drinking time
I wonder what it's like to be the only guy in a girl's life..

Will probably end up in the hospital for the amount of alcohol I will drink tonight
Bout to snap on motherfuckers in here
Alex Morgan has a nice golf swing ;)
I'm already pissed off beyond belief and I've been here only an hour. 9 more shitty hours until I can leave this hell hole
Only good thing about Saturday mornings is the Country Countdown
10 hour shift then bar hopping
@sluttybitchhhh that's what I thought ;)

Never mind on bed time. Gotta watch Get Him to the Greek
@sluttybitchhhh dang who's this pretty lady?!
