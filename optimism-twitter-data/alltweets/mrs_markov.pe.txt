@eco_engeneer It's bull. No other team is forbidding any opposing fans from entering their arena. That's just embarrassing. Such a joke.
The Bolts are cowards. Not only do they not sell tickets to people living outside of Florida but now fans wearing Habs merch are forbidden.
@Ferknuckle You've been my inspiration and idol for years. You're such an incredible person all around. Enjoy your trip.
@2015IIHFWorlds Breaks my heart that they couldn't even get a win. I have a soft spot for them. Good, hard working people. All heart!
@BlueJacketsNHL Heart shattering. Love this kid.

@JanelyAshk Well thank you very much. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>How was your entire day?<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk I wasn't sleeping. I don't really sleep but thanks darling. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk I'm always right. Simple to remember. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Okay but I must go now majestic creature. I hope your day is going well so far. Till we meet again. <WINKING FACE><HEART DECORATION>
@JanelyAshk That's more like it. Obedience. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Hahaha joking.
@JanelyAshk So you're a unicorn. Deal with it. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@JanelyAshk It's a compliment. You're majestic, unique, out of this world, a rare gem and a pure treasure. One of a kind. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk It's okay. Not everyone is woman enough to handle the truth. Give it time. Eventually you will accept it. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Don't laugh at the truth. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@JanelyAshk Hahaha that's cute and funny.
@JanelyAshk Yes glittery unicorns too!
@JanelyAshk Why did you apologize?
@JanelyAshk Ya well I hate Detroit and the Leafs the most. Then Boston. I just think the Hawks are very conceited.
@JanelyAshk Only cuz your amazing self rubs off on me. You're like sunshine, rainbows and unicorns all at the same time. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk The list goes on. Like I hate Boston but Tuukka is everything. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Haha same. Like I hate Chicago but Hossa is the man. I hate the Kings but Doughty, Kopitar &amp; Gaborik. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk I swear I'm not still staring at the latest pics of Bob you just posted...<GRIMACING FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Doesn't matter to me either. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Well hello there Bob..<FACE THROWING A KISS>
@JanelyAshk I love players from all kinds of countries. I don't discriminate. <WINKING FACE>But Russians are my all time favourite.  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@vancitycanuckss Tall is all you need if ur going to drink poison. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>I buy Venti all the time but I only drink unsweetened iced tea &amp; coffee
@vancitycanuckss I bet it was. I never drink Fraps cuz I eat clean but vanilla bean was the bomb. Try cafe vanilla and cinnamon dolce too. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Exactly. I don't like desperate people. I hate when people rely on others and act hopeless. Like grow up.
@JanelyAshk I love them all. Wish Radulov &amp; Tyutin was there. Bob, Malkin, Kulemin, Panarin and Dadonov. But all! <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Ooooo I hear Moscow is gorgeous. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@CanadiensMTL My heart is still pounding out of my chest. Any advice on how to make it stop until the next game?#gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL @PAParenteau Am I the only one that started to cry of happiness when PA scored? #gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL @sportsexperts clue: SUMMER #1stHabsGoal ELLER! #gohabsgo
@MooseSkin79 Maybe so..maybe not. Either way, they made it farther then your Nucks. So calm your tits girl! :P Don't be such a hater. :P
@CanadiensMTL Omg this would be so great. Just the energy boost we need. Miss the kid so much. Such a smart kid and rarely makes mistakes.
@eco_engeneer Just saying the truth. <PURPLE HEART>
@eco_engeneer We were familiar enough way before then. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Ya which ones?<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer People always ask and beg me to give them a chance but I'm like naw. I'm not into the party scene. I like calmness.
@eco_engeneer I don't like attention and I like to keep to myself. I prefer having a few quality friends compared to a huge group.
@eco_engeneer There's nothing wrong with that. I prefer to be quiet and introverted. I'm private and not a loud mouth.
@eco_engeneer And I wanna yell it right back to Russia. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer You have a great mindset when it comes to life. You're a very smart woman. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Aww that's the nicest thing ever. Thanks so much hun. I love ya woman. I could say the same for you.
@eco_engeneer I can take as long off as I want cuz I make enough that I wouldn't have to work again. I only work cuz I love my job.
@eco_engeneer If a weekend game is on early then I will work early in the morning and come home for the afternoon.
@eco_engeneer I want to. I already decided to not work during world's. During playoffs I can cuz all games are at night. But..
@eco_engeneer Oh I get it. Well considering I'm a doctor. I'm create my own schedule. I work when I want to work and take time off when
@eco_engeneer Ya I know you don't. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>It doesn't define me.
@JanelyAshk I mean every team has room for improvement..even Canada. I think Russia has a very good roster. A lot of my fave players.
@JanelyAshk Oh I love these. Merci! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Ya they are. Russia is too so don't cut them off. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I love Russia. Love them with all my heart. Canada gets heart and soul. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Did you get any photos of Bob drinking from his water bottle on the bench from earlier today?
@JanelyAshk Haha you best. As long as Sweden or USA doesn't win gold then I'm happy.
@eco_engeneer Pardon? Get what?
@eco_engeneer Which one though. A song or you're starting to love my psychopathic mind? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Canada obviously. I bleed those colours. I'd die for them.
@JanelyAshk Obviously. Always has been. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@JanelyAshk It would break my heart. 
Tomorrow Canada plays Switzerland which will be rough for me cuz I'm Swiss too.
@JanelyAshk That doesn't bother me. I'd prefer you not to root for my team. They're mine! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Sure was. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk I know that. Idc. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Glad to hear you're fine.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk But the Canada game kept me on my toes.
@JanelyAshk Canada game was tight! Effing Jones!<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@JanelyAshk The two games I watched so far were out of this world. But I meant the Habs game later..
Ya the Russia game was a massacre.
@JanelyAshk Hello!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>Fabulous at the moment. Hopefully still fab around 10 pm. Hockey...<HUSHED FACE>. 
How are you?

#StanleyCup 

@eco_engeneer So yes I absolutely have a real job. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer patients.
@eco_engeneer I interrogate serial killers, stalkers and pedophiles. I also go to a mental institution and do the screenings for new
@eco_engeneer Yes I have a real job. I have my private practice, I have my own clients. Second I also work in law and do criminal profiling.
@eco_engeneer I'm not one to show off but I know you mean no harm. But ya I'm wealthy. Let's just say I can buy anything my heart desires.
@eco_engeneer Who me? Or are you singing to me with your lyrics? <WINKING FACE>
@MooseSkin79 have won. So blah blah blah.   <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@MooseSkin79 Oh shut up. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>The games have been tight minus game one. The Ducks just got lucky. If it wasn't for that penalty, Flames would
@vancitycanuckss My heart and bracket both say Caps. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@vancitycanuckss Ew that's humongous for a Frappuccino. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@vancitycanuckss What took you so long?<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Did you get vanilla bean?<WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer New wave, classic rock and heavy metal. My favourite band is the Smiths and my idol is Morrissey.
@eco_engeneer Haha I could do it for days and days. I love shopping. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer I can't wait to see Ovi get his cup eventually. I love him. I like Carlson, Brower, burakovsky, Kuznetsov, latta &amp; wilson too
@eco_engeneer Go ahead. Ask it. I'm curious.
@eco_engeneer I will respond to everything else later. I've got things to do. Hope you have a lovely day. <PURPLE HEART>
@eco_engeneer No I watch every single game of the tournament.
@eco_engeneer Going to more stores tomorrow for flowers after the Canada and Russia games. Well technically today.<WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Then today I just went to buy flowers and plants cuz summer just started and I have a huge property so I had to buy a bunch.
@eco_engeneer I went to Tory Burch and spent nearly $1000 <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>. Cheered me up temporarily.
@eco_engeneer Oh nothing in particular. Just tons of clothes, jewelry, a purse and shoes. After the Habs went down 3-0 I was depressed so..
@eco_engeneer I hate her. Besides I only listen to music from the 60s to 80s.
@eco_engeneer Actually I watch every single playoffs game. And actually I'm very much interested in the Caps. I care about them. Flames too.
@eco_engeneer No I'm watching world's. I have been out shopping for three days straight in the mornings so I'm catching up.
@eco_engeneer Ya like I said. Two to three hours of sleep max. But even then someone has to drag me to bed. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I always refuse.
@eco_engeneer Although if I was dead..I wouldn't sleep. I'd haunt the shit out of people. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@eco_engeneer Sleep is for the dead.
@eco_engeneer It's early. It's only 1:40 AM. Besides I hate sleep and I'm watching hockey.  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Thanks for your concern though.
@eco_engeneer I can't stand quitters or people who act defeated. I hate when people say there's no point or no use in trying to change.
@eco_engeneer  Exactly. That's my exact motto. Life gives me enough of a high.
@NHLFlames @ferdaddy27 Love everything this kid is about. Beaut! #Flames
@NHLFlames Johnny Hockey's hands are unreal. Kid is a gem! #Flames
@NHLFlames @ferdaddy27 Woooooo hoo! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#Flames
@eco_engeneer Ya for me I think it's gross and pointless to drink. Plus it's unhealthy. There's several reasons.
@eco_engeneer Yup its what makes us unique. We're both one of a kind.
@washcaps Out of all people it had to be that disgusting goalie crasher. I swear that guy will never get his karma. It's bull.
@eco_engeneer Are you serious? Good for you!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer That's fine with me. I can care less what you think. They're my heart and soul. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@eco_engeneer I don't drink alcohol. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
The ref is clearly a Rangers fan...#Caps
@eco_engeneer I don't get it. Die when I die?
@eco_engeneer Haha that is gold!<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer I'm going to be that old lady at every single Habs game. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>My ashes will be spread at the Bell Centre.
@eco_engeneer I believe in everything you said except dying young. I enjoy my life and want to live until 100 so I can see my Habs. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@washcaps Holtby just robbed Marty! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>#Caps
@eco_engeneer It's not. Everyone's loveliness comes out only for certain people that earn it. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Earn something if you want it. Don't wait for it to happen, go make it happen.
@eco_engeneer So true. I agree with this. This is what I preach and live by. Nothing should be given for free.
@eco_engeneer I could say the same for you hun. How could we go on without your loveliness? We just couldn't! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer I love that movie. I've watched it around five times. It's well done.
@eco_engeneer Trust me, it's your style of movie. There's more than one too.<WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer I did! I smiled and laughed the entire time. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>awwww your french is adorable. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@eco_engeneer Exactly! People use destiny as an excuse for their lazyness. Not enough people are willing to put in hard work.
@eco_engeneer More like a thriller. It's a true story. Watch it. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer But I wasn't excited that it was my birthday cuz of my age.
@eco_engeneer But I do allow people to take me out and spend time with me and stuff. I did have a fabulous birthday.
@eco_engeneer I used to. But a few years ago I started hating it cuz I want to stay young. So I refuse to have a huge party.
@eco_engeneer Destiny? Pshh I create my own life and the way I want it to exactly be. I create my own outcomes.
@eco_engeneer Same cuz it sounds like we think alike. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Although have you ever seen the movie Hostel? That would be fun! <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>

@eco_engeneer Aww that means you want me to live a long life. Likewise sweetheart.
@eco_engeneer Um it doesn't feel any different. But that's because I've felt old and close to death for a few years now.
@eco_engeneer I'd never give a piece of shit attention. I'd punch her in the face but I'd never live on and obsessively hate.<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer I'm too mature and a grown ass woman to hate anyone. My time is too valuable to be wasted on hate.
@eco_engeneer Hey! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>Thank you sweetie. I never told you. Creepy!<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>haha just kidding. I don't hate anyone.
@NHLFlames He's the man!
@HockeyGods Amish beard. Love it.
@washcaps @ovi8 @backstrom19 @andreburakovsky @mjohansson90 Ovi's smile looks like it's ready to do some damage. Go Caps! #Caps <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@CanadiensMTL This guy is such a beaut. Give this man a contract! #gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL I miss our barn. It's going to be electric tomorrow night. Can't wait! #gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL And then God said, "let there be Jeff Petry." #gohabsgo
@ebs_14 Pigeon! Hahaha I can't stop laughing.
@mnwild I'm not going to lie. I'm going to start to cry. Just saying. <CRYING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Of coarse. I'd sure hope so. You're Russian for life. No one can take that away from you. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Bahaha I love you. You're hilarious.
@JanelyAshk It's good. It makes you more worldly!<WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Okay then...I'm the one who hasn't missed a single game in 25 years. I know the way they are. So don't right...me. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk You're becoming cultural. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk When they want to.
@JanelyAshk You just said eh like a Canadian. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Well I've seen my team be all the way at the bottom of the standings and for a good while. But I'm always a true fan. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk I know it's hard. Many seasons of 25 years I have been through some really depressing hockey.
@JanelyAshk Be patient. It will feel great and will be well worth the wait when it happens.
@CanadiensMTL Haha I love how they all have both hands on their hips. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>#gohabsgo
@JanelyAshk That's your job. You have to be a true fan through thick and thin.
@JanelyAshk Of coarse I know that! He's so precious and a sweetheart. Always places a big smile on my face. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@eco_engeneer Exactly. I sleep maximum 2-3 hours a night. Hockey gives me all the energy I need. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Ya my hair is wavy with curls. I wish it was naturally straight. I have long and thick wavy hair with curls.
@eco_engeneer Ya for me once the Stanley Cup has been won, those few months afterwards are hell. It's as if life has no meaning.
@eco_engeneer Ya I've had long hair since then as well. Never short. I hate it.
@JanelyAshk Your profile photo is amazing.
@JanelyAshk Aww thank you sweetheart. I'd hug you if I could. <PURPLE HEART>
@JanelyAshk Oh hey sweetie. Ya I haven't told anyone on here. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>Thank you. I actually had an incredible day. I'm happy now. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@mnwild DUUUUUUUUUUUBBBBBYY!!! That's all I have to say. #mnwild
@NorthLegends This is great news! Thanks for letting me know. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@NHLFlames This made my night. I'm so excited. Can't wait. GO FLAMES! I still believe. 
The Saddledome is going to be electric.#Flames
@mnwild No Stewie sprint. :( #mnwild
@CanadiensMTL He has been nothing less than a beast during the playoffs. Such a great pickup. #gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL I still believe. A true Habs fan knows that there's always a way. #gohabsgo
@eco_engeneer We're a part of each other. You're my better half. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Haha you've got that right. Anything looks wise, like superficial I get upset and hockey. Hockey fucks me up.
@eco_engeneer True but I only like long hair. It's my comfort zone. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Mine was at my belly button. But I just cut it so it can look more alive. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>My hair grows fast so it's only an inch away again.
@eco_engeneer Veins? Haha omg I love you. You always crack me up.
@eco_engeneer Haha this is one of the funniest things I've ever read. I love how your mind works.
@eco_engeneer I like it as long as possible. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Well if I'm a princess then you're the queen. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer It's the only thing that makes me emotional. Well that and hockey haha before I use to cry when I'd get a haircut. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Hello, nice hearing from you. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>I'm doing great, how are you? Haha do you like your haircut? I hate getting my hair cut.
@RychelsRuffians I like the optimism. I want to be under 30 for the rest of my life. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@MooseSkin79 It's 2-0 girl. Hold your horses!<WINKING FACE>There's no way they're going to lose back home in Calgary. The fans are electric.
@RychelsRuffians I'm very glad to hear it. Mine is on Thursday. Getting old...<NEUTRAL FACE>.
@MooseSkin79 Haha you're not convinced. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@NHLFlames Oh don't do this to me. <WORRIED FACE>
@HockeyCentraI I've been down all night due to the loss, but this actually made me laugh. Thanks.
@NHLFlames Ramo is in beast mode! #Flames

Please sign Jeff Petry. 

Sincerely,
Every Habs fan.
@jjmhabs @CanadiensMTL True that! 
Yup I know. Price deserves better than this. Just disgusting to watch.
@CanadiensMTL No discipline on this team whatsoever. Babcock would straighten up this team. Just saying.

@eco_engeneer Trilingual. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Which language?
@eco_engeneer Ok that part I didn't understand. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer Haha Ya I enjoy knowing so many languages. I want to learn Korean and Russian. 
So you know English and Russian? Bilingual  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>!
@eco_engeneer thought english is your first language. No joke. Yes I speak french, spanish, italian, portuguese and romanian.
@eco_engeneer Being honest. How you speak is actually quite impressive compared to others. If I didn't know you are Russian I would have
@eco_engeneer Yes really. If you're important to me and I actually think you have worth to be in my life, I'm extremely sweet.
@eco_engeneer Girl you speak great English. Don't worry about it. :)
@eco_engeneer Calm down. I'm not mad hunnie. I know you're not saying anything bad. I'm just making it clear that you have me wrong.
@eco_engeneer Oh trust me. You can't offend me sweetie. I never get offended. I don't get mad. I'm just making myself clear.
@eco_engeneer Actually very wrong. People say I'm a very sweet person and I know I am. But not everyone is entitled to my sweetness.
@eco_engeneer dependent on others. That doesn't make me a shitty person. People tell I'm a very good person. I'm just selective. I'm picky.
@eco_engeneer I'm not a shitty person. I'm not a bad person. I treat people with respect. I only said I don't care for emotion and I'm not
Brian Flynn has 3 points in 5 GP in the playoffs this season. He has been a healthy scratch for 2 games so far. Ridiculous. #gohabsgo
@eco_engeneer Haha what's inky hearts? :P
@Sportsnet #Tweet4Tix #gohabsgo :)
@eco_engeneer Aww that's so darn cute. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Thanks sweetie, likewise. <BLUE HEART>So far my day has been great. Hope you're enjoying your night. You can always talk to me. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk It's reality.<WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer I never let things get to me. Life is too valuable.  My time is worth too much to be bad tempered. I love life.
@eco_engeneer I don't have a bad temper actually. I'm the most positive and optimistic person ever. I'm never mad.
@eco_engeneer Yes I believe and love God very much. He's the only person I need to answer to. I'm not hurting anyone by living my life.
@eco_engeneer Well to be honest. I'm 100% straight up honest about everything I say. I don't believe in lying or being fake. This is me.
@eco_engeneer I only like hockey, my career, animals, living healthy and clean and anything horror. I like serial killers too and stalkers.
@eco_engeneer I have no idea what that means. I don't like cocoa and cookies. I'm a raw vegan that doesn't eat salt, sugar or junk. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer I'm all of the above.
@eco_engeneer Actually this is the greatest thing you have ever said. I say this all the time. I'm the female Dexter Morgan. Practically.
@eco_engeneer That's the way Canadians ate raised. Nothing I can do about it. We help but don't expect anything in return. Nor do I want it.
@eco_engeneer But I believe in helping people for sure..but I have no interest in having those people in my life. I'm just helpful.
@eco_engeneer I never ask for advice or respect other people's opinions. I make my own decisions and can care less what people think of me
@eco_engeneer You're wrong. I like listening to people's problems and helping them but I would never tell anybody anything personal about me
@eco_engeneer People started talking to me and I'm Canadian so it's rude to not respond back. So it is what it is.
@eco_engeneer Well you're wrong. I actually made this account only a few months to collect points for club 1909. It's a Habs thing.
@eco_engeneer That's me! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk You don't remember cuz it becomes a part of you when you enter the land of Narnia.
@eco_engeneer People are not something I care about. I like it that way. I like animals that's it. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Actually I don't need any humans. I don't need anyone. I'm very dependent and I created the life I wanted.
@eco_engeneer temporarily sick and cuz of it you'd hate cigs and they'd gross you out. Only the rough stuff for you.
@eco_engeneer In reality cuz I take no bullshit. I'd give you aversive conditioning. I'd give you an aversive cigarette that would make you
@eco_engeneer Great job. Smart cookie. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>But hypocrite. You're feeding into what your job wants to combat. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>Rebel. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I feel bad. With the he ninth goal for Canada, the German fans immediately got up and left. Why can't this be a team I hate? <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>#IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Ya ya ya ya. Easy for you to say now.  
<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@JanelyAshk But you're the goddess of perfection. We all bow down to you  <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk You said the Canada game was unpredictable? As you were saying....<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Shutup. That's not possible if you're the ultimate perfection. I'm one level down from you. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
It's hard to celebrate once it becomes 8-0 Canada. Then you just feel bad and not challenged. Either way Go Canada!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Canadian ones are that we're intelligent, well educated, rich, helpful, kind, well mannered and that we say sorry too much. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer You said you miss your family. You're not that cold. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>I could go the rest of my life without seeing another human being.
@eco_engeneer You happy. Like start doing something you've always wanted to do. It can keep you busy and not so dependent on cigs.
@eco_engeneer Same thing with missing people. You need to change your life in a way that you can surround yourself with things that make
@eco_engeneer alternative of something you enjoy that relaxes you that you can always have with you. It's all about learning to modify.
@eco_engeneer Well figure out what kinds of situations make you nervous and remove yourself from them. If you can't then find a healthier
@JanelyAshk Of who ? Americans and Canadian ones?
@eco_engeneer Aw thanks. But why? That's not so impressive. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer Never ever. Never will. I see no point.
@eco_engeneer What types of situations make you want to smoke. Like when do you usually turn to them? Like what does it help you cope with?
@CanadiensMTL 2-0 Habs.. #gohabsgo
Cody Eakin with his 2nd goal of the game and it's now 4-0 Canada!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Most are wrong and racist but not Canadian and American ones. They're more of what are characteristics are as people.
@JanelyAshk Easy to do research. <WINKING FACE>Going tomorrow actually cuz I need some more Tory Burch flats. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk There are. But Canadian and American ones are very accurate. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I've been going to the states once a week since I was born.
2-0 Canada! 23 seconds apart! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Oh they do haha and they wave and say hello. Haha. Raised differently here I guess. Very loving haha
@JanelyAshk Perfect!  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Exactly. There's so many great things you could fill your hours with other than sleeping like in a coma.
@JanelyAshk I meant hold doors.
@JanelyAshk walk into people without saying sorry. It's weird. It's the stereotype of Canadians and Americans.
@JanelyAshk Ya but it's not like that in the states. People mind their own business and are selfish. They don't hold foods for people and
@JanelyAshk me first. So if you smile at me, I do the same. No problem there.
@JanelyAshk No that's not why. I have my personal reasons. But I do smile every day to strangers but that's cuz every stranger smiles at
@JanelyAshk I don't want to miss anything. People waste too many years sleeping.
@JanelyAshk Haha everyone says that. Been like this since I was six. I hate sleep. I like staying awake to enjoy life.
@JanelyAshk But that's how Canadians are raised. We're not selfish and we like to help.
@JanelyAshk I don't smile at strangers. I never smile unless I like you or its hockey.  But I do help strangers. Got intense manners. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Look it up if you have no idea what it is. <WINKING FACE> No but in all seriousness. How long have you been smoking?
@eco_engeneer Helping you is more than just limited text. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> For me I'd give you aversive conditioning, it would make you quit instantly. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Haha good for you. I sleep the most three hrs a day or I go a few days without.
@JanelyAshk Haha I figured.
@JanelyAshk Haha how many hours do you normally sleep in a night? 
I will respond late. I have to go for now. <PURPLE HEART>
@JanelyAshk Same here. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>We're not fake. But we may be overly nice. Very extraverted and helpful to everyone. Smiling at strangers. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Bite you so you no longer have a secret to tell because you too will be a vampire.
@JanelyAshk That's horrible. Every Canadian I know is happy, positive and nice. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@JanelyAshk You know my secret.
@JanelyAshk Omg I'd never dream of such a thing. I could never do that, nor have I ever met anyone that does that. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@JanelyAshk Woooooo hooooooo!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>My day hasn't ended and will continue cuz I never sleep..but I'm honored you get to be my highlight. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk Well anything is important to me if it's Canada. Canadians take anything for our country seriously. Far too much pride.
@JanelyAshk You caught me! Arrest me. <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@JanelyAshk Ya but any tournament is equally important to Canada. We bleed for that maple leaf. I'd die for it.
@JanelyAshk 99% of the time. The 1% depends on team like...*cough* Canada. Haha I'm kidding...<SMIRKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Ya that's why I said the goalie won't matter but I'd still enjoy having a goaltender I enjoy watching.
@JanelyAshk That's true. It can go either way.
@JanelyAshk I wish Luongo was the goalie. <WORRIED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Only because of their passion and energy. They still need more experience.
@JanelyAshk Oh I never said that they're bad. It's just Canada come on now. The roster is perfect minus the goalies. They can all score.
@JanelyAshk give their all. Not quitters. Hard work ethic. Very determined.
@JanelyAshk Sure are. I have so much respect for them. They made me cry in the Olympics. Was happy for them. They have so much heart and
@JanelyAshk Yes. 
Coach believes that it's a team and even the backup deserves to experience it.
@JanelyAshk Less than 5 hrs away for the Russia game!!!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@JanelyAshk Must have been bad. <WINKING FACE>
But ya if Canada loses which they won't it will be Jones fault. But I know they won't. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@JanelyAshk 100% positive. Even though Jones will be in net. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Haha bullcrap.<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> Canada can handle them easily.
@JanelyAshk Watching hockey shows and waiting for Worlds.
@JanelyAshk No complaints. Pretty darn good. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>How has your morning started out? Did you sleep well? Any good dreams?<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

@JanelyAshk Of coarse! Perfect the way you are. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

@JanelyAshk Did you see him waving and smiling at the camera? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Marko Dano baby!!! Those quick hands.  #IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Oh I did...just stating a fact!
@JanelyAshk Haha you're such a weirdo.<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer It means that we are unique and have our own personalities compared to everybody else with a fake image.
@JanelyAshk No need to apologize. I noticed that months ago. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk That's so cute.
@eco_engeneer Oh I know. We have a bond.
@eco_engeneer Bahaha but those types are the best. People like us are the smart ones. We're not all the bimbos that copy each other. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk If it was my team. I'd have a heart attack. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer I meant to say "says." Oh well..<WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk They're only fun when it's not my team. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer She's very cold hearted haha she has no emotion. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Every day cuz I see my best friend leslie every day. 
She never hugs or saves I love you. Big step when she said it to me. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JanelyAshk Ya I'm blessed. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Omg SHOOTOUT! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@eco_engeneer I hug best friends only. Extremely picky. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Hahaha that's cute.
@JanelyAshk I don't know. I just have everything I need and want. I am everything I want to be. My life is exactly the way I dreamed of. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk  In reality my life is a fairytale. I have the perfect life. Just hockey gives me a mix of emotions. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Haha they're called bear hug. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Bahahaha very funny. That's true.
@eco_engeneer It's not possible. I'm tiny. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk I know. This is crazy!
@JanelyAshk I know. I'm actually smiling cuz of it. I haven't smiled since before the Habs game. Having fun. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer I know she's an angel. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>That's awesome. Give her a hug from me. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk I have suffered many tears cuz of it.
@JanelyAshk I know. I was scared Slovakia would never score.
@eco_engeneer You can thank Jane on here. She calls me that. Rubbed off on me.  <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Didn't even notice.
@eco_engeneer I'm sorry love. I didn't mean anything bad by it. It's a good thing here. Didn't even notice I said it.
@JanelyAshk The business side sucks though. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@eco_engeneer But a split soul sounds cool.
@eco_engeneer The last thing I do is lie. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk It's insane. Goals coming out of nowhere back and forth.
The Slovakia game is insane. Not sure if my heart can keep up. #IIHFWorlds
@JanelyAshk Can't wait to see Ovi though. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Oh.<CRYING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Omg it's tied again. This game just got interesting.
2 goals in a minute and 18 seconds for Slovakia! YES! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#IIHFWorlds
@eco_engeneer Yes but so is mine! You bring out my soft side.  <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Slovakia on the board!! Finally!!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#IIHFWorlds
@eco_engeneer Then perfect. <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@eco_engeneer Haha no. But it's all that would make sense if you're younger than me. But your heart is dark and cold so possibly. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer Haha I'm in my twenties dear. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Haha you're just being silly. Nothing just watching hockey. So much hockey on today but only one NHL game. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>You?
@eco_engeneer Actually you can be my clone. It's a replica version of me with no soul. A twin wouldn't be possible. If different age. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer You don't know that.  How old are you? I have a feeling you're older than me.  <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Then shhh new subject.
@eco_engeneer Actually I think you may be my clone!<FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer Haha that's true!
@JanelyAshk Ya but it's not fair. It's bullshit. Wish it was a fair goal.
@eco_engeneer Guess you won't like me!<FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@eco_engeneer Girl that shouldn't bother you. I have no problem with that. They're not hurting you. <WINKING FACE>I pray like four times a day.
@eco_engeneer Like what do you mean...crosses and statues?
@eco_engeneer Haha it was fate.
@JanelyAshk Thanks. It's keeping me distracted. It makes me forget temporarily.
@eco_engeneer I have no problem with that as long as it's not rubbed in my face.
@eco_engeneer Actually it's a known fact that many psychologists are actually serial killers. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk I don't want to talk about it. I feel robbed. 
And I'm glad to hear you're well. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Gee I don't know...Tampa 
Bay's overtime goal last night was fucking offside. Refs not doing their job like usual.
@JanelyAshk Well you know. Not as happy as usual. But being positive. Morning is starting off great so that's good. You?
@JanelyAshk Bonjour!<WHITE SMILING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Haha Sahara desert. What do they do that's so bad?
@eco_engeneer Definitely not afraid of you. I live for danger!

@eco_engeneer First off. You may not be able to handle my bite. I get quite rough.
@eco_engeneer I never follow anyone. It's rare. But I did cuz you're awesome! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer I love the Jackets. They're very special to me. But I've been a Habs fan for 25 years and never missed a game. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer I fucking love Rask. I haven't missed a single game he has played. Been following him since his milk carton throwing days.<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer See I knew you liked me back!<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>Definitely repeat. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@eco_engeneer Haha I love you. You're awesome. I like that too. But you know. I'm a psychologist so that's what makes it funny. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer But I understand why you're a Bruins fan. You have a dirty and ruthless side but a secret soft heart cuz CBJ. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer I don't care what team a person likes as long as they're classy and respectful.
@eco_engeneer Girl. You never mentioned Bruins in your profile. It's all CBJ!<WINKING FACE>But it's okay. No problem with me.
@eco_engeneer See you're human.  You got a lil sad. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@eco_engeneer Well good I'm glad. I only like true hockey fans. I hate girls that wear several team jerseys..<CONFUSED FACE>
@eco_engeneer Holy shit. Okay you've lost your mind. I'm going to go now so I can get ready for the Habs game. Have fun lil psycho. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@eco_engeneer You're a psycho haha. I'm not afraid of anyone. I'm known to be a serial killer. But I like you and that's rare.
@eco_engeneer Shut your mouth! Haha no not like that. I'm just very much an adult and I'm not childish like that. No puck bunny here.
@eco_engeneer Your psychotic personality reminds me of myself. More people like us need to exist so I need to let you live.
@eco_engeneer I didn't decide woman! I believe in shredding people to pieces. But Russians are cool. Besides you're too much like me.
@eco_engeneer I'd massacre you. But like I said. Russians are off limits. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@eco_engeneer But I love Russians. I decided to allow you to live.
@eco_engeneer Bahaha fine! I was going to allow you off the hook. I was being nice which I hardly am. <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Omg!<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>You just made my day. You're hilarious.  
Look at you sounding all hard core.
@eco_engeneer Omg this is hilarious. You're so funny. You called me amigo haha you're too cute. I guess I won't fight you.  <WINKING FACE>
@eco_engeneer Actually. Those aren't people I have crushes on. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Those are my fave players. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>I was joking about Tyutin.  I'm too old to crush
@eco_engeneer Not a lady eh? This is interesting. Like a lord of the rings battle.
@JanelyAshk Always do.  <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk You can stop making my day now!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

@CanadiensMTL 4-2 Habs. #gohabsgo
@socklesshal He was one of a few players that actually showed up to play. Why waste his energy if it's better used in game 2?
@JanelyAshk Twins!<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Haha well not a problem I'm willing to get rid of. Hockey is life and it makes me happy. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I'm just far too obsessed. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Not to my level...I take hockey way too seriously. I have a problem.
@NHLFlames I may have a heart attack..
@NHLFlames Good call. No point in wasting his energy on a game that was long over.
@JanelyAshk No I hate it. Like in the Olympics I basically died. 
I had to root for Canada to score on my blood. 
<POUTING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Because I'm Canadian but I'm also Swiss. So it's awkward.
@JanelyAshk Naw. Group B is. For me at least. I'm just mad that the Swiss are in group A cuz I'm Swiss too. So..it hurts.
@JanelyAshk I don't like Sweden...<UNAMUSED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Naw. For me the most interesting is Russia, Czech and Slovakia.
@JanelyAshk It will be. 
Excited to see Jagr. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
And an endless amount of players. Too many to name.  <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Going to record the USA and Czech game. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm so excited.
@JanelyAshk Cuz there are games on at the same time.
@JanelyAshk That's true. That's what I'm telling myself.  
I'm going to watch all four. Will watch two live and record the other 2. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@NHLFlames Of coarse, count on the 18 year old. 
So bummed but this kid puts a smile on my face. 
Going to be something special!#Flames
@JanelyAshk Oh Shutup. You wouldn't be saying that if it was CBJ! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Latvia
@NHLFlames Well as if this night couldn't get any worse...
@JanelyAshk Ya I started jumping up and down. I was going crazy. 
Don't tell me hockey is hockey bullcrap.<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>I know so excited. 10 hours!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I've never actually ditched a hockey game before...but this is depressing. #Flames
I'm trying to tell myself it's only game one.... #Flames
@JanelyAshk It was good. Happy the Caps won but sad cuz of the Flames. How did you sleep and how has your day started?
@JanelyAshk Good morning beautiful!  <HOT BEVERAGE>
This isn't happening....#Flames
Johnny Hockey and those hands. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>Kid is something special. So exciting to watch play. #Flames
@washcaps @BlueJacketsNHL You're going to love this.
@washcaps Done in time for the Flames game! Just perfect. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>Great ending. My heart is going crazy. So happy right now!<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@washcaps Omg I'm jumping up and down and my heart is pounding like crazy. Is this real life? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

@FlaPanthers @2015IIHFWorlds @narodnitym @68Jagr I thought Jagr said he retired from playing internationally? <WINKING FACE>Well this is great news. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@mikeweaver_43 Oh come on. You're a stud and literally don't look a day over 30. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@myregularface I love Ovi but sometimes he needs to shut his mouth. That will only fire up Henrik even more.
@Nationals @WRamosC3 @Bharper3407 #ComeBackKids woo hoo!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Holtby is on point tonight! #LetsGoCaps
@washcaps @ovi8 It was so fast that I was convinced that it wasn't a good goal. #LetsGoCaps
First whistle in 5 minutes? Bad start. Keep it up and the Rangers will eat the Caps alive... #LetsGoCaps
@HockeysNation I want the Caps to win but I think the Rangers will. <POUTING FACE>
@SniperWays So clever. Adorable.
@BlueJacketsNHL It's nothing against you. They never reply to anyone.
@mnwild Well earned. No one believed in him and thought he'd never be a stable starting goaltender but he proved the nonbelievers wrong.
@HockeyGods They have lost their minds.
@mikeweaver_43 Such a stud! #gohabsgo
@GoalieWays Haha Wilson. I'll let it slide, he's still a kid.
@NHLFlames I'm so excited! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#Flames

STORY: 
@Joeys_Jackets Bonjour!<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Holy crap
 GQ model or hockey player? I'm not sure. These photos look like a magazine spread. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>He's a natural. <WINKING FACE>
@ArponBasu I am afraid. Cooper's exact words were my own at the final buzzer.
#RDSCH 
@Dave_Stubbs Oh you know..just crying..expecting the worst.
@hockeymotto Holy crap. "I hope you achieve your goal." "You deserve it, I'm rooting for ya." That's amazing. <CRYING FACE>
@JanelyAshk Remember I'm always right. Don't go to others for answers.  
Kidding. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk No that's not it. Many players say they have an injury so they have an excuse for being eliminated.
@JanelyAshk Disagree. Because there's several teams that don't make it. So there's enough talent. Many just want to rest.
@JanelyAshk Not if NHL players decline due to injury, wanting to rest or just not wanting to participate.
@JanelyAshk Trying is the first step. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Be quiet. Canada is always supportive.<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk I never said all of the roster is minors because it's not. It's mostly nhl players. It's the goalies.
@JanelyAshk Good. I'm glad you're making a change.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Thanks for being useless Red Wings...<NEUTRAL FACE>.
@JanelyAshk realist. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>I state facts. 
Ya they're in the minors.  So sucks for them. USA's roster blows.
@JanelyAshk You're not an optimist. You always say negative things about your life.<WINKING FACE>I'm actually a really optimistic person but I'm also a
@JanelyAshk Shutup. Haha clearly you haven't watched any Coyotes games this season. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>Trust me I know my goalies well. <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk I will too.
But what I meant was that I'd have no problem watching any game in the world in general as long as it's hockey.
@JanelyAshk Ya they are. Well as long as they score enough to make up for the goals Smith allows in.
@JanelyAshk Hockey is life. I don't even care who plays..I just love the sport in general. I can watch every hockey game. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk The goalie could be better. Smith isn't what he use to be. He went downhill.
@JanelyAshk Some Americans say stupid shit. Canadians think otherwise. Anything with our Canada logo in front is important to us.
@washcaps @TheHersheyBears Well that's bologna.
@washcaps You haven't mentioned Ovi's big news! <WINKING FACE>

@TheHockeyChat It's funny but they also look ridiculous. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@TheHockeyChat Just ridiculous. So childish and extremely superstitious. That's a weird one.
@kschroeder1720 I would do the same. <WINKING FACE>I  get really into and sing every word when I hear it. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Joeys_Jackets Omg you're cracking me up with these photos.
@JanelyAshk Of coarse!!! SILLY QUESTION!<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>Obviously you are too. <WINKING FACE>
@TannerDanielle Very cool. That's awesome. Good luck!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@mnwild Hmm...
@JanelyAshk Don't make me go over there and smack you. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk True. <CRYING FACE>
@JanelyAshk I know you didn't. But you mentioned USA and that's enough for me..<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk I know they're better than that.
@JanelyAshk Shut your pretty mouth! <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
I love Oshie though, he's a class act.
@JanelyAshk Oh I understand. It was a huge thing. They were furious and sad. Oh I know all about it.
@UPROXXSports Such a goof.
@CanadiensMTL Wow you just stabbed me in the heart...
@ovi8 @specialhockey This is so damn cute. I love this friendship. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Oops Switzerland. Auto correct.
@JanelyAshk I never ever want anything for USA. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Haha to be honest, I was hoping Russia would get silver or bronze. I wanted Canada gold, switzerkabdet silver &amp; bronze Russia.
@JanelyAshk Everything.  But I just loved the atmosphere. The whole vibe was great. It always kept me smiling. It's gorgeous there too. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@TannerDanielle Np! What's your major?<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk It was my favourite one. Wish it could always be in Russia.  <WINKING FACE>
@TannerDanielle Good luck sweetie. You've got this!<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Senators Good for him. He's such a warrior. I have so much respect for him. Love the guy. I hope he wins this battle soon.
@JanelyAshk of coarse I loved it.
@JanelyAshk I forgot to ask you. Did you go to the latest Olympics?<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk If a language is going to be mandatory then it should be English because it's a universal language.
@JanelyAshk Oh....
That's dumb!<CONFUSED FACE>

@CanadiensMTL Miss that veteran out there so much. But whatever he is going through, I hope it gets settled soon. Keeping him in my thoughts

@JanelyAshk Oh cool. At least you have options.

WATCH: 
@JanelyAshk Well that's great! Only makes you smarter. 
In Canada you have to learn french and the USA, Spanish.
@Dave_Stubbs @cafemyriade @Skillsy75 Exciting! I take it you're going to be writing an article on Hal?<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Ok. Either way. Still fun. I love learning new languages. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Oh that's awesome. I never knew that they required you all to learn it. That's awesome. Well you do a great job. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Ya German is very strong.  Like really really strong!Do you have to learn it or do you have other options?
@JanelyAshk Really? <HUSHED FACE>I wanted to know. Did you take classes or learn from TV?  Tell me something.  <CONFUSED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Yes it's quite delicate. It's very calm and relaxing. Soft spoken, I like it.
@JanelyAshk Haha of coarse. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
How did you learn English?
@JanelyAshk After french..it's my all time favourite. Just love it!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Yes a completely different language to others I've heard. I've heard so many but nothing like that.
@BlueJacketsNHL Miss and love you! <HUSHED FACE>
@JanelyAshk Aww as are you. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk is threatening another person. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I don't know I just love it. Overall it sounds like a confident language.
@JanelyAshk Well it's strong, but sexy at the same time. Like it sounds real confident. Sometimes it sounds like someone..
@JanelyAshk I know what you meant. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I was just stating a fact. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@JanelyAshk My personal tutor. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>The writing is intense though. Like the words.  Looks so pretty though. I love how it sounds.
@JanelyAshk You're right. You're perfect.  <WINKING FACE>
@JanelyAshk I know it's a lot. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I want to learn Russian and Korean though.
@JanelyAshk Haha I love you! You're awesome. You say the cutest things.
@JanelyAshk Yes. I speak French,  Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian.
@JanelyAshk I know. I say that all of the time. God bless whoever invented it. My life has meaning cuz of it. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>I am? How so? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Haha <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@JanelyAshk Ya I'm excited to move somewhere new. Plus Vancouver is just breathtaking..but nothing beats Montreal. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@JanelyAshk Hockey always helps me. It makes everything better. It's like free therapy.
@JanelyAshk History is never fun. But just cuz it's boring don't slack. Still get it done to the best of your ability. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk to Vancouver in a few months to do my PhD to be a doctor. After that I will move to Montreal.<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk In Canada.  I live in Ontario but right beside the USA border of Michigan so I go to a lot of red wings games. But I'm moving..
@JanelyAshk If I lived in Russia I'd bring you soup and tea. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Just eat and drink your favourite foods and watch hockey to make you feel better. I hope you feel better.
@JanelyAshk Oh no. I haven't had a cold in like three years. Ya you're right.  It's impossible to be happy when you're sick.
@JanelyAshk That sounds real cool. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Okay it's 16 C here. Ya the weather here is up and down. It can be hot like hell and then cold like hell the next day. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Pretty hard days? Just don't stress about it. It's life. Learn how to manage it so you can eliminate the stress. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Oh you don't have a specific major?
@JanelyAshk 60 F. So not bad. I can go out in a light sweater. How about over there? I heard you have intense winters. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@JanelyAshk What's new with you? And what do you study?
@JanelyAshk Nothing at all. Just enjoying my week off from uni and then the summer semester begins. Just waiting for hockey to start. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JanelyAshk Great! Day just started but it's starting off well. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>How was your day?
@Ruddiger86 I believe in them. Anything can happen.
@JanelyAshk You killed me in a good way. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Joeys_Jackets Oh that smile. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk You know you just killed me right? Love this!
@CanadiensMTL Great to see. Miss him in the lineup. #gohabsgo

@JanelyAshk People tell him he's not though cuz of his Russian accent. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Idc!What makes you think I care? <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>Just saying what he is.
@JanelyAshk Yup. Born in USA but his parents are Belarusian. He grew up all his life in Russia. He just says he's American and Russian.
@JanelyAshk Nope. Born in USA so he plays for USA.
@JanelyAshk Russian. Like Galchenyuk. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk I know they're close and that's why I wish they'd just combine!<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>A lot of hockey players that are Belarusian just call themselves
@JanelyAshk He will always be Russian to me. I don't care. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@JanelyAshk You shouldn't have reminded me. I was happy living in denial. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk I've noticed that several times. And it pisses me off so I guess with time I created a fake image in my head. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JanelyAshk I always thought he was Russian or Belarusian. Which honestly should be the same thing by now...
@JanelyAshk Everyone thinks he's Russian though!! Wow my mind is blown. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>I think my day just got ruined. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JanelyAshk Wtf!! I'm so confused right now. I've been following his career since the very beginning. I'm so confused.  <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>He's German? Wtf
@JanelyAshk Kulemin!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>No Grabovski?<CRYING FACE>

Babcock: 
@HockeyCentraI That's beautiful.  <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@VanCanucks Damn Chris Higgins beard game is strong. It's so big, it must be full of secrets. #Canucks
Some of you have left messages and comments for me. I'm sorry I haven't replied to them. I've had a busy week. Will respond tomorrow.
Kris Russell is one of the greatest defenseman in the league. So underrated. It's so exciting to watch him play.  #Flames
@mnwild I'm not worried. He has played every game other than last night like a God. It was bound to happen. He will bounce back. #mnwild
@CanadiensMTL Omg Thomas! Love that kid. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#gohabsgo
@CanadiensMTL What a beautiful surprise.  That one was worth a whole lot. Merci! #gohabsgo
@PredsNHL The rookie! Woo hoo! Kid is the man.
@DetroitRedWings You had one job! ...<NEUTRAL FACE>
@PeteBlackburn <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>Wilson is great.
@washcaps @Kuzya92 So proud of him. Such a beaut!
@TeemuSel8nne @NHLJets Ya even though they got swept, the first three games could have ended the opposite way. Just bad luck.
@TeemuSel8nne Wish you were playing then I'd actually be happy for them. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@Russostrib That's moronic. Every game should be played as if it's a game 7. Hopefully they learned from this and will fix that attitude.
@StLouisBlues Tara being nasty!<WINKING FACE>
@MooseSkin79 Oh haha ok good. Here I thought you were like a Kesler mega fan. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@MooseSkin79 @NHLJets I don't like Kesler. This guy for some reason never gets his karma. I take it you're supportive of all former Nucks?<WINKING FACE>
@NHLJets This is so heartbreaking. I feel for you guys. So close.
@mnwild I want to hide in a closet and cry. <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@NHLJets Watching the national anthem. I've got chills all over my entire body. Good luck!
@StefanoDiLollo @CanadiensMTL @CBCMontreal That's sick! #gohabsgo
@Enial_HUT @Cellying @mnwild @not_MattDumba55 This is sick!
@jennabrooke87 He's being wasted away. He has so much to contribute.
@jennabrooke87 Me too. It's ridiculous that he's never in the lineup. Every team only dreams of having the best faceoff man.
@CanadiensMTL That penalty kill nearly gave me a heart attack. My heart is pounding out of my chest. #gohabsgo
@jennabrooke87 @CanadiensMTL That sign is epic!#gohabsgo
@dominicholden I'm Catholic &amp; I believe everyone has the right to adopt as long as they're good people. To hell with this bill. Disgusting!
@BlueJacketsNHL I'm Canadian. This isn't fair. I'm a huge CBJ supporter. <CRYING FACE>
@mcassel12 @BudRedLights A blanket fort? That's so cute. #gohabsgo

@ItsCanadasGame Clearly not a real hockey fan...
@ArponBasu I still don't understand why he has been a healthy scratch in the playoffs. He played every game before that and played well.

(via @mnwild) 

Perfect.
@mnwild He has earned it. If it wasn't for him, Minny most likely wouldn't have made the playoffs. Beast mode has been on since he arrived.
@timbozon94 Glad you arrived safely. Enjoy your summer. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@CanadiensMTL 1-0 Habs.  #gohabsgo
@PredsNHL I'm heartbroken. Horrible way to lose. Pekka stood on his head. What a shame.
@YikYakApp What on earth is a Zune?
@ETD51 I just bursted out in laughter. This made my night. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@myregularface Weird? I could have watched that for hours.
@EHClothing Sounds about right.

@karlie_krug Ryan Miller is in net!!!
@cooldogfacts This is so precious. This makes me happy.
@cooldogfacts Accurate!
@NHLFlames Brodie's goal even made Ryan Miller look up and want to go in. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>#Flames
@NHLFlames @DennisWideman6 3 straight powerplay goals! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>#Flames

@LordStanIey  I'm dying. This is pure perfection.
@EemilSelanne I swear I'm not crying...
@TeemuSel8nne Looks like you never took them off. Beaut! Miss you dearly.
@JanelyAshk Looks like a stud to me! :p
@NHLFlames Keep an eye on him in game 4? Not a problem considering it's impossible to ever take my eyes off of him. #Flames
@NHLFlames Hudler is the man! #Flames
@mnwild Please don't touch the lines! #mnwild
@NHLFlames I'm feeling a hatty tonight from the kid. :p Probably just wishful thinking..but it could happen. #Flames

TALE OF THE TAPE → 
@CanadiensMTL So unfortunate, but I do trust Pateryn. He has this covered! #gohabsgo
@vancitycanuckss Just remember junk food isn't worth temporary pleasure. Food is fuel so eat healthy. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@vancitycanuckss Well no one says you need to workout in a gym. I don't. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@mnwild Game was such a blast. Duby first goalie during these playoffs to earn a shutout! BEAUT! #mnwild
@NHLJets I can't watch the post-game interviews. That game made me incredibly sad. Deserved such a better outcome. In a case of emotions.
