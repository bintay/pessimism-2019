Week 28 Recap: #ForevermoreAlex 
proofreading first ep recap ro musta thesis proposal
@AnnaVeee ATE SENT YOU TEXT MESSAGES!!!!
@iloveenzo816 not even tweeting tonight! School sometimes suck for that and I'm not even that articulate unlike @paoacflores but thanks!
first episode pa lang wait lang roooo
wow my post for this week's episode is crazy-long can i keep this up
inaantok na naman ako outreach at 8AM but i need to write everything that's been bugging me this week
HI ULIT FANS OF FOREVERMORE!
Do you finally see the light? Wrinkles are being ironed out! Tadhana nga naman oh! #ForevermoreTadhana
@LizQuenfinityUS Thank you! :))))
@LizQuenfinityUS Hi! I would like to ask permission to use your screencaps of this week's episodes of FM for my recap blog post. =)))
IS THIS FOR REAL AM I JUST DRAINED FROM TODAY I CAN CRY NOW THANK YOU PO (sorry po my symmetry's breaking)
@markangos 
@StarMarcelo1 i don't have much to say other than the story's been sticking to its promised premise. (2)
@StarMarcelo1 can't really force you to. to each their own, after all. but as a fan whose interest was sparked by the theme (1)
i am dizzy i am sleepy i think i should sleep now and watch the ep later huhu
They're finally ironing the wrinkles in the characters' lives! See why there's the small trace of light? #ForevermoreLigaw
Sobrang nakakatalino ng FM, not just mentally (in an alternative, ideal world i would've taken a communications course) #ForevermoreLigaw
To everyone asking, I can't live tweet or even after-TV-airing tweet because the last 3 hell weeks of the sem have begun #ForevermoreLigaw
@paoacflores I am truly, honestly touched! Ours are always among the best Twitter conversations I will ever have! Thank you for everything!
@zsabatchoi Thank you po! =)))
@heyitsPipz thank you for the willingness to wait! =)))
@zsabatchoi HAHAHA i'm sorry po!!!. i haven't watched the ep yet. was only trying to address the agitated. that was pretty stupid of me huh?
@heyitsPipz sorry po but i haven't watched the episode yet! was only trying to address the agitated. will tell you my take when i do. =)
@zsabatchoi not trying to impose on anybody just here to offer perspective, not to grant anyone's desires 'cause that's beyond my capability
@silverlight_ph I share the same sentiment. And I am confident it will be. One way or another.
@iloveenzo816 @paoacflores don't really mean to impose on anybody but here to offer some perspective. =)))
@silverlight_ph since time immemorial teleseryes have offered everything imaginable. but FM, being grounded, has proven otherwise.
@silverlight_ph Forevermore's already different from Day One. I'm pretty confident the staff wouldn't want to make it any lesser than it is.
@silverlight_ph I get that feeling but aren't we supposed to be happy that they are tying up the loose ends now? On edge, really.
@Enriiquegil17 @paoacflores thank you and good for you! =)
@sofeimous no problemo!!! pordalab!
Disappointing how some are jumping off the bandwagon. This show's supposed to make you THINK and NOT just be ALL KILIG. #ForevermoreLigaw
When this show started it was clearly meant to be about second chances. And second chances need not only be about love. #ForevermoreLigaw
Complaints? You must be barking at the wrong tree. This story's very grounded and you're supposed to see that! #ForevermoreLigaw
@paoacflores ATE PAO OMG you remember our last talk? I am touched!
This is why I don't like clicking on the HT URL. So many are frustrated but can't even remember the theme: second chances. #ForevermoreLigaw
HI "FANS" OF FOREVERMORE!!!
if you actually don't dwell on the lack of romancing between the leads, you'll see the light #ForevermoreLigaw
hala umuulan
will probably sleep this off then wake up to watch the downloading film
i am so sleepy i don't understand why
last 3 weeks of this sem and this is how i feel wow

@itscarlawithaC huhuhuhu but... oh well to each their own =))))
Guess I don't deserve a reply, not once but twice.
IN A WORLD LIKE THIS WHERE SOME BACK DOWN I KNOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
@itscarlawithaC why.............? :(
rappler live tweeting the concert i crei
@SirrChief ansakit sa puso :(
BACKSTREET BOYS BREATHING THE SAME AIR AS I'M BREATHING TONIGHT AND I AM CAGED UP IN THE DORM POORITA PROBLEMS HUHUHUHUHU :(((((((((((((
can't watch #ForevermoreGuniGuni on TV tonight iwantv na ituuu :(
"Well, it was fun while it lasted." Hayyy, Xander.
ja ginapugpog eon ang ueo ah
@iloveenzo816 YAAAS! And thank you for the well-wishing. =)))
@iloveenzo816 (anyway, last na) Sobrang scary ng part na ito, ewan. My heart skipped a beat.
@iloveenzo816 Many didn't like it but this is the road to forevermore, after all! :)
@iloveenzo816 Hi! Sorry talaga can't chat tonight. May exam kasi bukas. Hope you'd be able to watch tonight! =)))
ANNOUNCEMENT!

CODE PURPLE TOMORROW, MAY 5, 2015. #Galawang133
@carbonarah GIRL THIS IS AWESOME! pwede ko bang gawing headdress yung bag ko? purple din kasi eh. ya know, make the most out of what i have.
Kept pressing the snooze button then my phone decided to take a dive from the top of the dresser. Woke me up real quick.
GUYS WEAR PURPLE TOMORROW HAHAHAHAHA
Goodnight, 133 lec be like, "Come to me, baby. Let's battle."

Ro, stop with the "be like" olredi.
I like Alex and I hope she doesn't develop feelings for the Xander who's detached. He's not himself. Won't be healthy. #ForevermoreAlex
Very consistent with the concept of forever and second chances. Love this show. #ForevermoreAlex
Guess Jay and Alexandra = constant reminders. What more, nasa La Presa/Baguio pa sila. The magic has started. #ForevermoreAlex
Jay's consistently a converse to Xander and the things he does will never parallel what Superman's done. XaGnes 'to pramis. #ForevermoreAlex
@iloveenzo816 WHYYYY???
I wonder how XaGnes will turn around after the falling-out but there's not much room to guess. These writers! I'm on edge! #ForevermoreAlex
I see what you did there, Xander. Added to the creeps I felt was a stitch that readily formed in my chest. #ForevermoreAlex
Although it's disheartening to see Xander cold and detached, I must say this is interesting character development. #ForevermoreAlex
Alexandra be like, "Hey, Katukayo, ako nga pala pinadala ng universe para maalala mo si Ms. Calay. Ano, miss mo na?" #ForevermoreAlex
I wonder why Xander wasn't too happy when Alexandra started her fish-y jokes? Oh, wait. He's reminded of Agnes. #ForevermoreAlex
@AnnaVeee I'M TOTALLY PREPARED ATE HAHAHAHA saglit lang ito =)))
Alex must've caught all the energy when the heavens decided to rain some on land. Such a sunny girl. With a crazy streak. #ForevermoreAlex
I wonder why Agnes was not too happy about Jay playing Bonita-rodeo with Niknok? Oh, wait. She's reminded of Xander. #ForevermoreAlex
Naiyak ako n'ung biglang pinakita si Xander. The hallucination be like, "Hey, babe. Miss me now?" #ForevermoreAlex
Taga-Baliwag ata si Alexandra. Kaloka. HAHAHA #ForevermoreAlex
Orly be like... "Boss, hindi ka ba na-inform? Ako ang number 1 fan ng XaGnes! Trust me, okay?" #ForevermoreAlex
Even while seeing Niknok having fun with Jay as the kid plays Bonita, Agnes didn't seem to be too happy. I wonder why... #ForevermoreAlex
This sums up my feelings after finding out about Rappler's promo :( 
Still one of the many beautiful solos Nino's sung. Still one of the songs that hit me hard every time.
Remember singing this song all the time, relishing the feel of the piano keys I imagine I'm pressing with Nino's strong voice backing me up.
Ninomiya Kazunari's "Niji" just came up randomly from my music player and I'm immediately tearing up. Dammit how can I be so affected...?
@j0ssiean @janiaagnes salamat friends i feel the love
@greamecrackers hindi! sobrang walang time kasi mag-download :((( saka parang may hiatus ako sa arashi ngayon. pagkatapos na lang ng sem :((
@SirrChief hihihhihihi
Naniniwala na ako sa forever magmula nang makilala kita
Eh kaya hindi ako sumurrender~~

i can finally tolerate taglish songs wow
YOU ARE MY SOUL
WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH
SWEET SWEET
HAPPINESS

but i have to hold off downloading them 'cause 133 lec exam laslas
I FOUND LINKS TO THE ENGLISH SUBBED BLAST IN HAWAII DVD I CAN DIE HAPPY (jk have to watch it first)
@greamecrackers SIS MAY COPY KA NA BA NG BLAST IN HAWAII???
I'm still looking forward to the day that I'd be rich enough to afford a trip to Japan and a ticket to one of Arashi's concerts. =)
Live performance of 5x10 will still be my favorite. I still get chills while watching them :(((( Arashian forever, I am.
I am in tears while rewatching these Arashi vids.
They sound so good in every chorus I feel they're so together and tightly knit as a family
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH TOM FELTON 
@sofeimous Hi, Feah. Can I ask you a favor? :) Please DM me.
@j0ssiean I LOVE YOU SO MUCH WILL THINK TWICE NEXT TIME =)))

OMAYGAD PAPA YOU ROCK
"di ko na panonoorin ang replay. tama na ang lokohan sa boxing world. hindi na siya sports kundi business."

OMAYGAD

&lt;/3
mas naiiyak ako kasi nakangiti pa rin si manny nakakaloka ang iyakin ko pls
nuff said 
"Pa, talo tayo."
"Ganun talaga, ne. Luto."
"Naiiyak ako."
"Wala eh. Underdog."

FullSupport For THE BET

"Week 27" #ForevermoreMoveOn FullSupport For THE BET 
ako lang ba naweirduhan sa pagkakaayos sa mukha ni enrique sa metro mag? mukha siyang... ewan :(
all these cake pictures of sir sia su = craving pero goodnight sa dreams na lang yung cake
The stars will align and their happy ending will happen. :) #ForevermoreMoveOn
Had one of the most interesting conversations tonight. Thank you, friends! :)
@iloveenzo816 Goodnight! =))))
@iloveenzo816 I'll always be encouraged. =) Thanks again! =)
@iloveenzo816 No prob, kid! Thanks din for an exciting conversation! I enjoyed every minute of it =) And thanks for stalking me hahaha :D
@iloveenzo816 The stars will align and their happy ending will happen. =)) Hey kiddo, inaantok na ang ate. :) Have to wake early eh. XD
Things will look up. The La Presa Inn's been Xander &amp; Agnes' dream from the first day their love blossomed. It'll happen. #ForevermoreMoveOn
@iloveenzo816 Sabi sa'yo. Fate will find a way =))) Things will definitely look up. Remember, pangarap ni Xander at Agnes ang inn noon pa =)
@iloveenzo816 La Presa Inn project will close that! =))) For sure, XaGnes moments. Baka nga lang masakit at first. XD
Alex may offer female perspective for Xander, just like Drew to Agnes. Without actually developing feelings for the boy. #ForevermoreMoveOn
@paoacflores =))) Cheers to the first line of defense! :)
@iloveenzo816 Last 3 weeks na so for sure things will be patched up naman. The characters deserve their happy endings =)
@iloveenzo816 We don't know. Maybe Kate needs to say sorry once more. When Agnes has had time to mull over the matter herself =)
@paoacflores Ayoko na lang po talaga magsalita. They're not worth the energy. Yaan na natin, let's just make the team feel our love. =)
@iloveenzo816 Yes. Masakit pero kailangan nating indahin. =)
@iloveenzo816 Kate is a friend of Xander now. But Agnes sees her as a reminder of the pain she endured kaya it will always come between them
@paoacflores It happens. We just have to try open their eyes. Mahirap pilitin ang ayaw, though. And we should remember that. =)
@iloveenzo816 I almost forgot! Ngayong Nandito Ka yung movie na nasa Baguio si Echo and Tin =)
@iloveenzo816 Mahirap din kasi for Agnes. She's only heard the reason now. From Kate pa nga eh. She needs processing. Kaya matigas pa.
@paoacflores Aww ate Pao! I actually shrug it off na lang. It's as if they haven't seen how much the show's grown over the months on air.
@iloveenzo816 And of course the people directly involved. =)
@iloveenzo816 Yes. Kasi wala naman sa lugar ang ibang tao na sabihin yun kay Agnes. =) Si Xander lang talaga.
@iloveenzo816 Alam na nila =) Noong pinuntahan pa sila ng lawyer regarding the public legal case against Jaime Saavedra. =)
@paoacflores ATE PAO! KALMA! They're not worth the tears of a perfectly sensible fan like you! =)
@jeenabern @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano and last, 5) he is a tool to open Agnes' sleeping heart to a second chance at love =)
@jeenabern @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano 4) he serves as a catalyst for Agnes to realize that whoever comes, she'll always love Xander
@jeenabern @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano 3) he serves as a converse to Xander who knows his priorities in life and is accomplished
@jeenabern @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano 2) a manifestation that Agnes' heart can love someone else other than Xander if it chooses to
@jeenabern @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano he is necesary because 1) he's a manifesatation that Agnes' world is not limited to La Presa
@mirasolmoyano @jeenabern @iloveenzo816 he's an antithesis. Xander knows his priorities. But look at Jay, romancing while mom's in trouble
@mirasolmoyano @jeenabern @iloveenzo816 di naman po sa pinasok lang. I still believe he's a foil to Xander and the heartache Agnes suffered.
@iloveenzo816 Nope, di siya remake. May elements of the supernatural yung Forevermore ni Echo &amp; Tin noon at mangga naman ang fruit symbol =)
@MarkieGrande @iloveenzo816 @mirasolmoyano Wow that's ultra nega? Di naman siguro. I'm pretty confident. What with what happened sa PAI nun.
@mirasolmoyano @jeenabern @iloveenzo816 Wala pa po akong pambili ng DVD since I'm not yet earning pero as a fan masakit kung iba ang ending.
@iloveenzo816 Yes I think so. =) Pwede nga rin na she'll serve to offer him female perspective =))) Parang si Drew kay Agnes.
@iloveenzo816 I'd like to think she'll serve as an alternative to Papa Alex. Na Xander will find a new confidant who has wise words to say.
@iloveenzo816 I'm pretty confident na that will not be the case =)))
OMG HAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY TO OUR BIO 115 ILOCOS FIELD TRIP, BATCH 2016! LOVE YOU GUYZ SO MUCH.
@iloveenzo816 Wow! That's a new perspective ha =) I am more inclined to think na she'd help Xander heal without even developing feelings =)
@iloveenzo816 And I've also thought sometimes na baka hindi jowa ang ending ng XaGnes, na open ending lang. =)))
@iloveenzo816 It's a little amusing though! Madalas sobrang mind-boggling ng analysis ng mga tao =)))
@iloveenzo816 I agree with what you said. Drew came in quite nicely to offer Agnes male perspective (esp since he once went through it)
@iloveenzo816 Parang ganun na nga. Jay was a manifestation that Agnes' world is not limited to La Presa and Xander. =))
@iloveenzo816 Yes, I am actually on edge after hearing na 3 weeks na lang. Dunno how things will pan out. As in clueless. :(
@iloveenzo816 that's one of the major loopholes I find in the writing. But we can't really tell at this point. The writers are a mystery.
@iloveenzo816 Yes, indeed. But also if it were the alternative, he was somehow an idea presented to serve as an option for Agnes.
@iloveenzo816 You can have my word that they'll end up together. Kasi after everything they've been through it's unfair if they don't. =)))
@iloveenzo816 I think nakiki-ride lang din ang production team sa pauso ng mga butter na tao, na wala raw forever =) but have faith! =)
@iloveenzo816 Nakaka-BV nga naman minsan especially if you're very invested on XaGnes but Jay was a necessary character, a foil to Xander =)
@iloveenzo816 Aww thank you! I'm not as articulate as some other tweetpeeps but I find that encouraging (kaso hala nabasa mo mura ko hahaha)
@iloveenzo816 Yes I think it was necessary to have Agnes reiterate this to Jay kasi nga umaasa yung tao, which is very, very obvious.
@iloveenzo816 haha! I understand that you feel differently what with everything that's happening pero I feel positive the ending is happy =)
@iloveenzo816 And thank you! I try to stay optimistic about everything naman so I'm happy you find my tweets helpful =)))
@iloveenzo816 Because by telling him that she still loves Xander &amp; with Jay sharing this with Judy means she has already made it clear (2/2)
@iloveenzo816 And to answer this question, I think it's unnecessary for Agnes to tell everyone that she has, in a way, turned Jay down (1/2)
@iloveenzo816 But we all know Agnes is not ready and she's in love with Xander. That's why she should make it clear and reiterate to Jay.
@iloveenzo816 You see medyo nagkaroon ng spark of hope for Jay when Agnes said that she can love him.
@iloveenzo816 Hi! Sorry took a while to reply. By ulit, you mean, yung pagbasted?
And since we're down to the last 3 weeks maybe I'll have everyday blog posts for the last 15 episodes ((thinking)) #ForevermoreMoveOn
As someone who's decided it was worth the risk, who decided to give the pilot episode a shot last October 27, 2014 SEPANX #ForevermoreMoveOn
But this show's affected me in so many ways that I will always be happy for having watched every step of the way. #ForevermoreMoveOn
WE'RE DOWN TO THE LAST 3 WEEKS I'M CONFUSED WHAT SHOULD I FEEL I'LL FALL BACK TO BORING NIGHTLY ROUTINES (sorry intense) #ForevermoreMoveOn
A good weekender episode and the mystery of this new character should keep me excited for Monday. #ForevermoreMoveOn
"Jay, hindi ako komportable pag ganyan ang mga banat mo sa akin."
"Taga-Assumption ka ba?"
FUNNY (kahit ayoko kay Jay)
#ForevermoreMoveOn
HOY XANDER BAKIT MO BINITAWAN YUNG MANIBELA RECKLESS DRIVING (hahahaha) #ForevermoreMoveOn
Bonita wahahaha sige be a brat to Jay. Miss mo lang yung dati mong katabi sa kulungan eh jk be a good gurl #ForevermoreMoveOn
Not hating Erich's character. For sure she's a catalyst for bigger realizations for both Xander and Agnes. #ForevermoreMoveOn
I am happy with how things are unfolding! We should know that everything will end happily with XaGnes standing strong! #ForevermoreMoveOn
Mere coincidence indeed but it's not coincidence that Xander has opened his still healing heart to a new chance at love. #ForevermoreMoveOn
Mere coincidence that the character Erich plays is named Alex and first seen in a place where the sky meets the earth. #ForevermoreMoveOn
As for Xander, he's been hurt so no hate pls. It's natural to find that sometimes finding a new love is one way to heal. #ForevermoreMoveOn
I don't see the point of hating on Agnes for this ep. She made it clear that she's not ready. It's up to Jay now. #ForevermoreMoveOn
When a random panhandler suddenly spouts oracle language. Dunno if I should've been creeped out or if I should've laughed #ForevermoreMoveOn
"Mataas. Bundok. Bulubundukin. Lugar kung saan humahalik ang langit sa lupa. Doon mo makikita ang babaeng mamahalin mo." #ForevermoreMoveOn
"Kung gusto mo siya, sabihin mo. Kung hindi, sabihin mo pa rin. Para hindi umasa at magmukhang tanga." ANDREW YOU DA MAN #ForeveremoreMoveOn
"Di ba sabi mo siya yung 'mas kaya mong mahalin?' Pero Agnes, sana maging klaro ka sa kanya." O ayan, Andrew's spoken. #ForevermoreMoveOn
when i said it's a fun lie-in kind of night, i didn't mean i'll wake up at 3:30 PM honestly
something pretty depressing occurred to me: What if Jay shares with Agnes the bench she used to share with Xander? #ForevermoreDurog
new sheets and i've just taken a shower this is a fun lie-in kind of night
To keep it until she's strong enough to wear it again. Pretty much says she's willing to take another shot at their love. #ForevermoreDurog
officially jumped the bandwagon yay
#ForevermoreDurog 
SORRY PERO TONIGHT IS A NIGHT FOR MYSELF AND WHAT I LOVE SO NO BUSINESS I'M SO SORRY I NEED A BREAK
We'll see how Jay is going to fare in La Presa. I still don't understand how he could be there at a time like this, though #ForevermoreDurog
But Jay... how were you able to appease yourself by being in La Presa when you have problems to fix back in MNL? Baffling. #ForevermoreDurog
So that's where the promise ring has been sitting all this time. Sige, Agnes. Itago mo muna. Paghilumin muna ang puso. #ForevermoreDurog
"Isama mo na lahat ng sakit, Pa." Sounds like a desperate cry to cope with all the heartache. He needs to shut down. #ForevermoreDurog
The series has showcased the many facets there is to human nature as governed by the laws of love. Ready to see more. #ForevermoreDurog
Ready to see the Xander who's been changed by heartache and will be changed by love. My tear ducts have been replenished. #ForevermoreDurog
Seen the Xander who knows no bounds in loving. Now ready to see the Xander who's been changed and will be changed by love. #ForevermoreDurog
Ang pagpapagaling ng puso'y parang sugat. Aantaying matuklap ang clot; kung hindi, may peklat. Madalas may impeksyon pa. #ForevermoreDurog
It's in our very nature to run from the things that hurt us. It's learned. It took a while for Xander but there it is. #ForevermoreDurog
I don't wish for Xander to shut down but after everything he's been through, he deserves to feel numb even for a while. #ForevermoreDurog
Me when I saw Bonita: "OMG PWEDE NANG I-LECHON"
jk she's the cutest pig ever and @lizasoberano's so cute to handle her
#ForevermoreDurog
He is shutting down. But just like Agnes, it's a coping mechanism to guard his already heavily-bandaged heart. #ForevermoreDurog
"Isama mo na lahat ng sakit, Pa." Sounds like a desperate cry to cope with all the heartache. He might shut down. #ForevermoreDurog
He doesn't want to have anything to do with her, but as he'd promised to do his best for the hotel, does he have a choice? #ForevermoreDurog
Guess Xander needs to undergo a change himself. A growth apart from loving Agnes.  The same way Agnes had, in a way. #ForevermoreDurog
Jay be like... #ForevermoreHugotNiXander (pampa-lighten lang ng mood guyz) 
Amazing writing, excellent acting. Hands down. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
There's not much to say about this ep. I have a lot of feels and thoughts but I guess it's the same for everyone. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Guess it's better to take the second chance when they're both whole &amp; can love without reservations. Give it time. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Maybe it'll take each other's absence for them to actually heal and open their hearts, ready for a second chance. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Pusong bato si Agnes at Xander. By choice to guard their hearts. Maybe it'll take the two of them to change that. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
SOBRANG GALING THESE TWO ACTING AWARD PLEASE I WAS SOBBING THE WHOLE EP TAGOS @lizasoberano @itsenriquegil #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Hindi nakakainis si Agnes. The circumstances they've been in are to blame. They're both victims, she and Xander. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
@lizasoberano @itsenriquegil definitely deserve an acting award. All the gaps should serve as one of many proofs. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
It's time for Xander's worth to be brought to light. Agnes, ihanda mo ang sarili mo.
#ForevermoreHugotNiXander
@janiaagnes =)))))
Pusong bato si Agnes at Xander. By choice to guard their hearts. Maybe it'll take the two of them to change that. #ForevermoreHugotNIXander
Heartbreaking. Still recoiling from the impact. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Hindi makatarungan. Hindi. #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
PUTANGINA HAPPILY DRIVING YOU ARE MY WORLD LOVE YOU BYE LECHE MAMAMATAY PA #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
"The universe is definitely setting up a perfect ending for you. And I'm excited for that ending."
#ForevermoreHugotNiXander
TANGINA MAMAMATAY PA ATA SI PAPA ALEX TANGINA WHAT LECHE #ForevermoreHugotNiXander
"Bakit wala akong maramdaman? Alam kong marami na akong nasasaktang mga tao pero bakit wala akong maramdaman?"
#ForevermoreHugotNiXander
"Sinong kaya mong mahalin? Ito (Jay)?"
"Oo. Mas gugustuhin ko pa siyang mahalin."
"Sana pinatay mo na lang ako."
#ForevermoreHugotNiXander
Go, Xander. Show her how much you truly want to be forgiven. Show her your love that endured distance and time. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Kate, thank you. <FACE THROWING A KISS> #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Perhaps hearing the reason from Xander himself tomorrow will finally help Agnes forgive and forget. Hopeful. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Hearing the reason from Kate is a fuel to the fire. Fire that could either light up or let their world go down. #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Isn't it ironic how both love and heartbreak can change you? One feeds you strength while the other feeds on it. #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Guess hearing the reason from other people can never parallel hearing it from the person you need to hear it from. #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
It's difficult to open one's heart when the ears refuse to listen, as dictated by hurtful memories. #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Why she can't forgive? Healing takes time and sometimes it requires a sitdown talk between the people involved. #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Apparently, hindi pa talaga handa si Agnes. <PENSIVE FACE> #ForevermoreHugotNiAgnes
Since I still can't stay put, this ep is so significant, and Agnes's actions are justifiable... #ForevermoreAnswers 
#SaveMaryJaneVeloso PLEASE. INNOCENT LIVES ARE BEING TAKEN. WHERE IS THE JUSTICE IN THIS. WHERE IS IT. HAVE I ALREADY GONE BLIND. WHERE.
earlier, while inoculating potential coliform isolates onto EMBA plates, a jarring thought occurred to me: 4TH YEAR NA KAMI MAYA MAYA WHAT
@AnnaVeee HAHAHAHA i actually find it funny how i'm so into this. ngayon lang talaga ako nagkaganito.
and since my brain cells have been fried too early in the day and are still being fried i am now going to sleep. goodnight.
let me take this time WALANG KALABAN-LABAN SI MARY JANE MGA WALANGHIYA WALANG KONSEPTO NG HUSTISYA
The more significant issues are finally being dealt with. Shouldn't we be happier with how the story is now unraveling? #ForevermoreAnswers
Hindi lang naman kasi love story 'to. Remember, second chances. Second chances need a lengthy list of considerations. #ForevermoreAnswers
"Bakit ikaw nagawa kong patawarin?" Agnes finally asked this long-buried question. Cascade of deeper questions to follow #ForevermoreAnswers
Agnes asking the less obvious questions that matter, which only occur to most of us in periods of melancholy = HUMAN. #ForevermoreAnswers
Many glaring proofs that the characters are acting as thinking, feeling human beings and many are dissatisfied. <TIRED FACE> #ForevermoreAnswers
Xander's guilt gnawing on him. Jay's protective-possessive streak. Agnes running away. Mamang, Papang arguing. H U M A N #ForevermoreAnswers
Agnes asking the less obvious questions that matter, which only occur to most of us in periods of melancholy = human. #ForevermoreAnswers
To all who hated the fact that she ran, I say how Agnes reacted shows her being a human. #ForevermoreAnswers
The sight of Kate: the trigger. Agnes should fall back to melancholy, to ponder the more important things and questions. #ForevermoreAnswers
We were too happy about the kilig and we forgot about the darker, buried questions Agnes has yet to find an answer for. #ForevermoreAnswers
The ep gave us a chance to explore the deeper recesses of Agnes' mind, often veiled by happy/chaotic/intense things. #ForevermoreAnswers
This episode gives us a deeper understanding of the characters' thoughts when the light of day has passed. So why hate? #ForevermoreAnswers
I see dissatisfaction due to the lack of kilig and intense moments. How about the deeper thoughts we rarely think about? #ForevermoreAnswers
It's disheartening to see how one of the most thought-provoking eps, at least character-wise, receives so much hate. :( #ForevermoreAnswers
If everyone would just please take a chill pill and actually breathe more deeply, the HT will make a lot more sense. #ForevermoreAnswers
Both Kate and Jay have good intentions. Sure, I hate Jay's guts and Kate's wrong timing, but they were consequential. #ForevermoreAnswers
I mean, we all know the truth. But Jay doesn't. He doesn't share Xander and Agnes' history hence quick to judge, assume. #ForevermoreAnswers
Chill, kids. The writers know what they're doing. #ForevermoreAnswers
Jay's "pushing things too far", is a perfectly understandable reaction from a viewer, since we all know that truth. #ForevermoreAnswers
It was even better that they let us see and feel how painful it was for Agnes to lay eyes on Kate even after 2 years. #ForevermoreAnswers
I don't hate the ep. Agnes' reaction, her consequent actions--seeking for answers--made perfect sense. Smart writing. #ForevermoreAnswers
"Bakit ikaw nagawa kong patawarin?" Why, indeed? Because you love her? Because she is, after all, a part of your life? #ForevermoreAnswers
A moment of realization that left her asking more questions, desiring more answers. "Bakit ikaw nagawa kong patawarin?" #ForevermoreAnswers
"Bakit ikaw nagawa kong patawarin?" Agnes was thinking while lying next to Mamang. A moment of realization, eh? #ForevermoreAnswers
By answers, the writers meant answers being sought. Haha. Too smart deym.
#ForevermoreAnswers
But @lizasoberano's acting skills shone so brightly in this episode! I was gasping for breath after that first gap! #ForevermoreAnswers
I understand Jay's protectiveness of Agnes but it was too much when he told Xander to back away based on speculations. #ForevermoreAnswers
Jay's gut feeling that it was Xander behind Agnes' hiding away into the rabbit hole... not wrong but I'm not impressed. #ForevermoreAnswers
#ForevermoreAnswers answers that Agnes, Xander and the rest of the cast are seeking. Episode left loads of questions unanswered, that is.
just did earlier and holy freaking cow ang sarap now i am sleepy i need my nap 
I knew I wasn't the only one. What with Orly's repeated, "Mamamatay ka na ba?" #ForevermoreAnswers meanwhile i nap 
this is a light-bulb moment despite my ruggedness and the growling of my stomach

ginusto mong humugot. face the consequences.
I don't want to suffer from the dark and lack of oxygen down there. I want to move on. I want to do it fast. But either way I get killed.
If I try to resurface too rapidly from the dark pith you've thrown me into after breaking my heart, will I still live even with embolisms?
The banter between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly is the best goddammit when will I stop watching this movie maybe never
@j0ssiean wow meron palang ganun hahaha get over it gurl
"Well I think you have a gift for it. That was a perfect blend of poetry and meanness." double deng
"If I really knew you I know what I would find. Instead of a brain, a cash register. Instead of a heart, a bottom line." deng
When all the injustices of the world descend upon me and I'm made a criminal, will you still love me?
When finally all these powerful men brand me a murderer, will you still love me and believe in me?
dang speaking of which kumusta naman YYH fan fiction ko it's been on hiatus for too long i crei
and nope not high school setting. i picture a very convoluted plot. it's how i roll.
if i ever write a LizQuen fan fiction on wattpad that will be the day you can say i'm waaaaay in tooooooo deeeeeeep
(honestly i have a plot)
@PrincessFrance Ano pong magic meron ang LizQuen besides their chemistry at pumatok ang LT nila? Personal take nyo lang po:) #AskDakilangFan
@PrincessFrance Ano po ang most memorable scene sa FM para sa inyo? Why? (nuks pang pageant) #AskDakilangFan

HAHAHA POTAH 
BWISIT HAHAHAHA 
it's highly offensive when someone asks for your favor and they misspell your name. honestly.
this video ansakit sa puso //crying// The Road To Forevermore: Thank You So Much Kapamilya! 
@CJ_4u HAHAHAHAHA demmit this boyfriend
@CJ_4u anyare di ba sabi mo kalma? hahahaha
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil YES YES YES kaya please let's have conclusion-driven episodes na!!!
GDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII SHET I AM SQUIRMING 
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil whatever happens on monday, sana it's geared towards the conclusion na rin. i think it's been stretched far enough.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil yes well all we have to do is trust the writers kasi we don't really have a choice. it's their call.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil di ba? i think it's high time for xander and agnes to be brought together by (ill) fate. XD
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil ...annulment nina mamang at papang, ni alex at sheri, the san juans desperate attempts, jay and his mother's issue...
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil kasi naman kung may 15 na yung pagtatapos, andami pang unresolved issues. there's the la presa land ownership case...
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil but honestly may patterns naman ang writing ng script eh ewan HAHAHAHA
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil lol kaloka naman kasi yang super friends ni agnes XD
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil it's almost deliberate. kasi sobrang saya nila then alam mo naman, biglang bawi. foreshadowing ang dating sa akin eh
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil yung pagkaiwan ng phone was an intentional plot device. xander could've warned her about kate's presence if she had it.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil ...xander's in the hospital. mas malaking impact kung sa iba manggagaling explanation, lalo na kung kay kate. ewan haha
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil maybe i'm reading too much into it but if we think about the supposed last 3 weeks, the issues can be resolved while...
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil baka kasi agnes will run, xander will chase after her, then boom mababangga (sa roadside yung hotel) then kate explains.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil actually i've been pondering the repeated "mamamatay ka na ba, boss?" orly spouted the previous ep. parang foreshadowing
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil di naman ako disappointed. anyway, as agnes said, it's time to face what was left behind 2 years prior, including kate.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil yes just did! peroooo di ko masyadong feel yung boses ng lalaki ewan hhahaha
@lisamae_gil @CJ_4u mga walang magawa sa buhay XD
@CJ_4u actually! mga inggitero talaga HAHAHAHA
@lisamae_gil @CJ_4u OH ETO NAAAA 
@lisamae_gil @CJ_4u read it gha but rest assured it's not true. XD
@CJ_4u yup everyone's spoken about it. nakakaloka lang yung mga gustong manira juskolord. believe me i've seen how quen was in a taping day.
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil mukhang ganun na nga HAHAHAHAHA but it's perfectly understandable
@CJ_4u OMG YOU NEVER READ IT? sumabog ang fandom! 
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil grabe daming fans dito ah hahahahaha
@CJ_4u pero teh have you seen the blind item na si quen daw tinutukoy? kajirits yun!
@CJ_4u @lisamae_gil 
@CJ_4u yes yes!!! i'm still hoping na medyo bagalan nila. masyado pa kasing bata si bebe hopia.
@CJ_4u yes mga maninira lang talaga walang magawa. been a fan of quenito since forever. it's true, he's never said he liked anyone before.
okay na akong single 4eva basta ba may araw-araw na landi si liza and quenito he he he <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@CJ_4u boyfriend duties dammit <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> napanood mo ba interview niya sa Cinema One?
@CJ_4u yun na rin yun ahhhhhh these two &lt;3
@CJ_4u 
@CJ_4u just now spotted daw eh XD ewan ko :))) we need a stolen shot,
yes i'm a die-hard fan of ms. lea salonga and i'll defend her divine voice and artistry with all my heart and soul. <POLICE OFFICER> so scram, you dimwits.
@CJ_4u sabi ng ibang tweets hahahaha saka meron kasing picture ng package for the concert na "Enrique and Liza" ang nakalagay noon XD
"she's just a bigmouth.:( cant really sing like a diva." tanga ka ba kaya nga may alegro potah hina-high blood ako so stupid a comment <IMP>
i don't get why some people hate lea salonga for singing hits her own way--not copying the original artist, but owning the songs. <IMP>
liza soberano and enrique gil at #WanderlandMusicFest all over my TL gawd you two ang cute ng paglalandi nyo <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@janiaagnes OMAYGAD
pakihimos inyong kalhit pls kadamak ta
The bathroom scenes and Kapag Tumibok ang Puso. Apparently the content of this teleserye isn't really juvenile. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><THUMBS UP SIGN> #ForevermoreSurprise
Saw higher-def screencaps and videos so now I'm certain. Xander's lucky flower. :))) #ForevermoreSurprise 
But Kate is significant. She is undeniably significant. #ForevermoreSurprise
Hindi naihanda ni Xander si Agnes though. Naiwan kasi ang phone. #ForevermoreSurprise
The look in Agnes' eyes when she finally saw Kate, the reason she got left out 2 years prior. It was heartbreaking. #ForevermoreSurprise
For at the end of the day we know that she comes second in importance in explaining what really happened 2 years ago. #ForevermoreSurprise
As Agnes had said, it's probably time for her to face this. Surely it entails facing Kate as well. #ForevermoreSurprise
Last gap: got hooked behind my gut, dragged a million miles per second before being jerked back at the same rate. gawd. #ForevermoreSurprise
"Maraming desisyon ang tama sa paningin natin pero nagbabago ang pananaw natin pag nakita na natin ang kinahinatnan."
#ForevermoreSurprise
"Agnes decides for herself like a mature thinking human being. Can't we just give her that?"
#ForevermoreSurprise
"Pero kaya nating maging kaibigan sa kanya kung sakaling masktan siya."
#ForevermoreSurprise
"Pero kaya ba natin bilang kaibigan na pigilan siyang masaktan sa lahat ng oras? Hindi di ba?"
#ForevermoreSurprise
"Pero anak, puso lang ang bubuksan mo ha."
"Nay Mirasol naman eh."
"Joke lang, nak."

#ForevermoreWaitingGame

XaGnes StillTheOne 
Tama nga si Kuya Bangky. Nagkaroon na ng mukha ang mga bulaklak. And Agnes oh sweet Agnes couldn't say no. #ForevermoreWaitingGame
Jay can only talk about his problems with his other friends, not with Agnes. That is sad but rightfully stands. #ForevermoreWaitingGame
yung biglang, "No suka." - X
"Akalain mo 'yun, ayoko rin ng suka eh." - A
shems LizQuen na yun ah these writers &lt;3
#ForevermoreWaitingGame
THIS PART OF THE EPISODE I WAS LAUGHING TOO HARD DAMMIT #ForevermoreWaitingGame  
I'm still recovering from falling off my chair at the last gap. Should've heeded writer Mark Angos' warning. Huahua. #ForevermoreWaitingGame
Nung hinabol ni Agnes yung mga lobo OMG CUTIE PATOOTIE THIS KID #ForevermoreWaitingGame
Nahopya man dahil di dumating ang French fries nag-tumbling naman si Xander at tinanggap ni Agnes ang mga bulaklak #ForevermoreWaitingGame
Ang hirap nang pantayan ng FM. Ibang klaseng teleserye. Second chances in life and love and all. =))) #ForevermoreWaitingGame
naiinis ako may mali sa tweet na yun but i can't delete it now huhu
Nung nagpasirku-sirko si Xander kasi di nga dumating ang mga investors HAHAHAHAHA Quen so cute #ForevermoreWaitingGame
ew wrong grammar wait lang
It goes to show how even the grandest gestures can never parallel the sincerity of the person they come from. &lt;3 #ForevermoreWaitingGame
How Xander stared at Agnes while she was wolfing those sticks and sticks of isaw. Dammit the look of love and adore! #ForevermoreWaitingGame
It goes to show how even the grandest gestures can never parallel the sincerity of the person it comes from. &lt;3 #ForevermoreWaitingGame
Sobrang simple ng gesture, pinitas lang yung bulaklak, spontaneous decision. At sa wakas tinanggap na ni Agnes. HUHU
#ForevermoreWaitingGame
"Kuya, pabukas naman po ng radyo."
"~You were just a dream that I once knew~"
A W K W A R D
"Kuya, turn it off."
#ForevermoreWaitingGame
"Alam mo kaya di ko tinatanggap 'yun eh dahil di ko alam kung kanino galing."
"Alam mo na ngayon."
TINAGGAP NIYA OMG
#ForevermoreWaitingGame
HOMG 
@sofeimous omg uuwi ako sa aklan on June! paano ko mapapanood? magma-mall show pa dapat kami eh :((((
@sofeimous yes i agree!!! HAHAHA pero kalma lang mahirap na XD
this was me kanina (kailangang kalmado kasi si sister nakabantay ayokong mapatawag sa office) #ForevermoreFallApart 
"I'm so sorry for ever having doubted you, anak."
Mama Bettina the cracking of your voice is all too convincing. :(((
#ForevermoreFallApart
HT's misleading and not. Jay is indeed falling apart but Xander and Agnes? I think not. Dunno what to feel really. #ForevermoreFallApart
This is not to burst anyone's happy bubble... but what will happen when the infested La Presa fields are made known? #ForevermoreFallApart
Fate finally working its magic! (At ang kapangyarihan ng kambal na strawberry!) #ForevermoreFallApart
Let's all rejoice! Things will always turn around and it's fate we're talking about! Back to La La La La Presa!!! #ForevermoreFallApart
@sofeimous ikaw ha AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I'm still floating inside this tiny bubble after tonight's ep because things are indeed looking up. =)))) #ForevermoreFallApart
I applaud the writers for granting Xander the chance of giving that bigoted woman a piece of his mind. And soul. =))) #ForevermoreFallApart
And Xander oh Xander you've been so brave. Finally you've spoken up. And to Sheri's face pa!. Blew me away. #ForevermoreFallApart
Ang cute ni Agnes habang nagpipigil ng kaligayahan nang marinig ang inaantay na magandang balita! =3 #ForevermoreFallApart
Nanggigil ako nung biglang nag-French yung investors? At lalo na nung tumawag na si Xander? Agnes cheer up na!!! #ForevermoreFallApart
"Siguro it's time para magkaroon na ng mukha ang mga bulaklak. So that Agnes won't say no anymore." - Kuya Bangky
#ForevermoreFallApart
"It's only a matter of time." - Mama Bettina
This show's banking on time. Time and again. (no pun intended).
#ForevermoreFallApart
#ForevermoreFallApart ang pangarap ni Agnes? Xander's reputation? Jay's rock n roll (read: happy) disposition???
THIS IS ACTUAL GOOD NEWS (finally someone who deserves it!) 
OMG ANO ITO i need to jog. must. ready. heart. and. mind. and. soul. jk i'm gonna take a nap. #ForevermoreFallApart 
when you see it hahahahahaha #ForevermoreFallApart 
i'm tweeting this because it's happy 10K tweets ro you've made history (not) honestly (no) really (who am i kidding)
@jarimonty iba impact pag si doms na ang nagpasimuno haha
@j0ssiean kahit naman di ka magreply alam ko na yun. (feeler ko shet) thanks din, jara. for everything then, now, and tomorrow. mwah mwah &lt;3
last na: YUNG HOLDING HANDS THO ORLY Swabe ng move mo ha mygosh #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect goodnight everybody
goodnight na nahihilo na meeeeeeeeeeeeeee
SAVE YOURSELF AND SAVE MEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i have a lot of feels right now because #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect and 133 lab exam is /////////////////////////
@CJ_4u ansakit sa dibdib :(((
@emmy_morley sumikip dibdib ko eh :(((
@j0ssiean i love you i love you i love you
WALA TO SA EP KANINA AHHHH NAKO HOPE AND QUENITO 

#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect 
@iyannahgozun pero shet ang ganda nung scene ni agnes and jay huahuahua matutulog na nga ako eh XD
Jay was pleading. The only thing he has is his love for Agnes. It's the only thing he can hold onto. Ang sakit. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
"Ibigay mo na sa akin 'to." This line went for the double kill. Jay's pleading. Si Agnes na lang ang meron siya. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
@CJ_4u Wala na lahat kay Jay. Si Agnes na lang ang pwedeng meron siya.
@iyannahgozun LADYYYY
"Time will not only tell. Time will show." and for that alone i am willing to wait. goodnight. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
That line of Xander is so beautifully written I am still winded.  #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Jay and Kate. two well-crafted characters that you will never grow to hate. they are as real as they can get.  #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
nasasaktan talaga ako para kay Jay. it's a wonder why hindi "Walanghiya" apelyido ng walang puso niyang pamilya. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
with this writing caliber characters can't be really hated for how they are as people. there's depth and growth. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
OMG BEBEGURL 
agnes recalling memories with xander; when she looked at jay, it was different. no words but the look says all #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
when agnes cried upon hearing xander sing their theme song, probably reached her breaking point, of no return. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
show's incredibly frustrating and gratifying. i've never been this hooked. don't think it'll ever happen again #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
dear writers thank you for bringing us one hell of a rollercoaster ride every single night you are the best &lt;3 #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
di nanalo sila Agnes. pineste ang La Presa. walang matitirhan si Jay. mahal pa rin ni Agnes si Xander. hilo ako. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
pamilya ni jay + sheri --&gt; HUMANDA KAYO LINTIK LANG ANG WALANG GANTI #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
one moment you're in cloud nine, the next instant you'd feel sorry for the rival. this show is a rollercoaster! #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
yung feeling na "yehey, love mo pa rin si xander!" tapos biglang si jay binenta ang laptop? asan ang hustisya? #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
And tangina mo, pinsan ni Jay. Tangina mo. PUTANGINA NYO TIYUHIN AT TIYAHIN NI JAY (sorry sarap nilang pektosan) #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Napasipa ako sa hangin nung sa wakas umamin na si Agnes. Sobrang galing ni bebe @lizasoberano sa pag-arte grabe! #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Sunud-sunod ang kamalasan ah. But it takes the dark before things start to look up. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
I was all kilig over that scene but Jay's crushed look added to the blow when the wind got knocked out of me. #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
JESUS CHRIST INAMIN NA RIN NI AGNES #ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
"We're talking about forever here. Kung mahal niya talaga ako, time will not only tell. Time will show."
#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Maghihintay ako, hangga't buksan mo ang puso mo para sa akin.
Jay...
Agnes, ibigay mo na sa akin 'to.
#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Akala ko ba nasaktan ka niya?
Sobra. Kaya nga ayaw ko pa eh.
#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Jay, nangyari na ang kinatatakutan ko.
...
Hindi, na mahalin ko ulit siya. Hindi, mahal ko pa rin siya.
#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect
Jay, nangyari na ang kinatatakutan ko.
Na saktan ka niya?
#ForevermoreTheXanderEffect

she loves him still but there's the fear of losing him again, the trauma of being left behind. she needs reassurance. #ForevermoreKryptonite
@janiaagnes YES PLEASE! LET'S WATCH IT WITH EVERYONE! :)))) "BLOCK" SCREENING!
last na las na yun pramis goodbyeeeeeeeeeeee
@maaaaamro credits to @CJ_4u "their love is 2000 ft below sea level" XD
their love is 2000 ft below and above sea level. matayog ang nararating at malalim ang pundasyon. kaya legendary. #ForevermoreKryptonite
i'm burnt out na bye
last: Judy has a good heart. She's a friend. Flawed in places, but still a great one. Tonight's ep is a testimony. =) #ForevermoreKryptonite
oyasuminasai =)))
SO THIS LIZQUEN TVP FEATURE WITH THEIR FAN IS MAKING ME CRY :((((
@paoacflores sobrang na-touch ako kay Judy! i knew she has a good heart naman eh. she's a friend, flawed in places, but still a great one =)
@CJ_4u wala pa eh. but accdg to previous DVD releases of other soaps, ganun yung price per volume =)))
@CJ_4u mahal ang dvd hahahahaha 200 for 10 episodes!!! XD but yeah sige lang!
@CJ_4u yes, never! :))) but i think it's better to end early in a high note than extend to the point na maumay na ang viewers XD
@jarimonty aww jari thank you so much! you have always been so awesome! :)))
mute, unfollow, block. what have you.
@CJ_4u just read it somewhere in my TL pero ganun madalas pag may mga ganyang teaser eh. also, yeah i agree. kaya ng team. =)))
everyone's turning around, if incredibly slowly. it's as if they're laying out the resolution. #ForevermoreKryptonite
@CJ_4u ako rin naman mami-miss ko yung show but with everyone turning around it's as if they're setting up the resolution eh.
@CJ_4u srsly??? i thought last 20 eps na lang??? i dunno how it's going to end on a high note kung mae-extend pa eh.
@CJ_4u everyone's turning around!!! (malapit nang matapos :((()
ganda na sana ng gabi ko kasi ang ganda ng forevermore tas biglang this fame whores oh deym
get a life. stop worshiping fame. this is so demeaning even for me who shouldn't give a shit.
honestly, what is it with the number of followers? kids these days. i don't follow back just because you drop me a meager, "follow back".
hello sa mga nananamantala sa paggamit ko ng official HTs by following me then tweeting two measly words, "follow back", you can go away :)
@janiaagnes OMG DID YOU SEE THE SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN POSTER SA ROB CINEMA??? 08.12.15!!! JADE I AM EXCITED!!!
And now that we see this #TheRoadToForevermore teaser I can't help but feel nostalgic! :(((( #ForevermoreKryptonite
@CJ_4u NAKAKAIYAK YUNG SCENE NILA NI JUDY PLS
@paoacflores ate pao! tonight's episode is so full of love! the theme of friendship and trust and finally, coming around! :)))
i judged that this show was a good material from the trailer pa lang. never knew i would fall for it this hard. #ForevermoreKryptonite.
nung biglang may ganito after ng #ForevermoreKryptonite ANONG IBIG SABIHIN NITO :(((( matatapos na :((( HUHUHUHU 
sobrang sarap sa feeling kahit umiiyak ako dun sa scene nina judy and agnes huhu friendships &lt;3 #ForevermoreKryptonite
Sheri, ito na lang masasabi ko sa'yo:
BITCHES GONNA DIE DIE DIE HUMANDA KA! MATAPOS NG LAHAT NG GINAWA MO!!!
#ForevermoreKryptonite
lalo na dahil dun sa sabi niyang, "Di mo alam kung anong pwedeng gawin niya kay Agnes pag meron siyang tama." 
and Jay, when you said you can't give what she desires, i felt sorry for you. but you're still a good man. #ForevermoreKryptonite
the strong friendships in this show huhu goodness i can't help but be weepy #ForevermoreKryptonite
i'm happy. Judy finally showed the side to her that i loved in book 1. she's coming to her senses. along with Agnes. #ForevermoreKryptonite
Judy, thank you for turning around this episode. i knew you were a great friend and your heart's in the right place. #ForevermoreKryptonite
if anything, this episode proved how they truly love each other, and how that love is deeply rooted. #ForevermoreKryptonite
just a little bit more reassurance, i guess, and the big xander-agnes talk, and she'll probably open up completely. #ForevermoreKryptonite
she is aware that the old, veiled feeling is slowly coming back and inching into the light. but she's afraid. #ForevermoreKryptonite
she has her reservations, but we know we're she's coming from. nanggaling na rin sa kanya. nagbabalik na. #ForevermoreKryptonite
slowly, the agnes we all came to love is resurfacing. inch by inch. creeping out the rabbit hole. let's be patient. #ForevermoreKryptonite
i knew agnes will defend what she believes is true. it doesn't matter if it was xander or not. she has a good heart. #ForevermoreKryptonite
i'm so happy to see how ready agnes is to defend and stand up for the xander she knows and who taught her to love! =) #ForevermoreKryptonite
clearly in this episode we see how deeply rooted XAgnes' concern for each other is and how well they trust each other #ForevermoreKryptonite
Sorry for mistakes in quoting but hehe that's it for tonight's ep twitter recap! #ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ayaw ko."
"Ayaw mo o takot kang masaktan ulit?"
"Kung bumabalik man, ayoko na. Ayoko nang masaktan ulit."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ayoko lang mawalan ng kaibigan. Pero kung siya talaga, at alam kong matalino ka, sige na. Hindi na kita pipigilan."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Nakita ko kung pano ka muntik mamatay nang iwan ka nya. Kaya kita laging tinutulak kay Jay, kahit kaninong lalaki."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Nagbabalik na ang pagtingin sa'yo ni Miss Lane! Lahat nakikita 'yun ikaw na lang ang hindi."
"Orly, relax."
"Ayoko."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"At ngayong nawala na ang galit, nag-resurface na ang natabunan."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Actually sa tingin ko di naman nawala yung feelings eh. Natabunan lang ng galit."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ba't di mo aminin sa sarili mo na, oops I did it again. I still love him."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Nakikita namin sa mata mo. Mahal mo na ulit siya."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Uso matulog. Alam mo naman, lumang bahay. Si Aling Aunor nagta-transform 'yun."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ang gusto niya bumalik si Sir Xander bilang adviser niya."
"Eh di ko naman kayang gawin 'yun."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Iniisip ko lang po talaga si Agnes. May kompromiso po ako sa kanya eh."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Hindi ko na nga siya adviser, Judy, pero gusto ko pa rin siyang makasama sa project namin para sa La Presa."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ang importante, ang tingin sa akin ni Agnes."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"I don't care about how the world sees me, basta the people I love know who I really am."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"You should be glad!"
"You shouldn't worry about me."
"Boss, you're fired!"
"Well, it was fun while it lasted."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Miss Calay, napakalayo naman ng tingin mo."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Matagal na ba kayong magkakilala? Ba't ganyan mo na lang siya ipagtanggol?"
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Hindi nyo siya kilala kaya wag nyo siyang huhusgahan. Naging mabuti naman siyang adviser sa atin ah."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"As far as the proposal is concerned, he is the best adviser a student could ever have."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Wala pong kinalaman ang pagkatao ni Sir Grande sa pagiging adviser dahil ginawa niya ang trabaho niya."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Pangarap mo 'to di ba? Para sa La Presa. Andito lang naman ako para sa'yo."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"I'm sorry anak. You shouldn't have been caught in the crossfire."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Baka isipin niya, oo nga pala 'no? Tarantado nga pala 'tong lalaking 'to."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"May progress na sana. Kaso pagkatapos ng nangyari, lahat ng progress na yun mawawala na."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Sa lahat ng napagdaanan ko, minor na lang 'to."
"Kaya nga I want you to be happy with Agnes eh. May progress na ba?"
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Sa mga bagong binibintang sa akin, walang totoo dun ha. Yun. Yun lang. I just wanted to tell you that."
"Yes, sir."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Natapos nyo ba yung booth?"
"Nahinto po kami pero tatapusin po namin agad para sa expo. Yun lang po ba?"
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Ayaw ko namang manghusga ng tao."
"Di mo alam kung anong pwedeng gawin niya kay Agnes pag meron siyang tama."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"Anak, totoo ba 'yung nasa TV kanina?"
"Ngayon po, ibang tao si Sir Grande."
#ForevermoreKryptonite
"What we need from you is your commitment."
"Of course, Pa. We're all in this together, di ba?"
#ForevermoreKryptonite
OKAY MUTE NYO NA AKO I WAS TAKING NOTES WHILE WATCHING SO HERE GOES
@davidchoooy GISING BA SI KEBS GISINGIN MOOOO
@CJ_4u goodnight! :))))
@CJ_4u hahaha sige na, teh! good luck! &lt;3
@CJ_4u YUP!!! and as much as i wish to discuss it, may exam and long quiz pa ako mamaya gurl HAHAHAHA so bukas na lang!!! &lt;3
just did a faving spree because ate pao you produce the most articulate, most intelligible commentaries! thank you, always! @paoacflores
@PrincessFrance hi po! you with the rest of the creative team of Forevermore make my day! thank you po for the very smart material! &lt;3 :)))
ate pao how are you so articulate??? i'm learning so much and it's all thanks to you! =))) 
okay so that's it for tonight's ep! let's study =)))
sobrang effective nyo po @itsenriquegil and @lizasoberano di ako magsasawang sabihan kayo every single night! =))) #ForevermoreAlamNa
always trust the writers to give us a major plot device before the weekend to keep us hanging by a thread =))) #ForevermoreAlamNa
but if "D" = DETENTION, then madadawit ang mga taga-La Presa! maybe they'd get to fight together a second time??? #ForevermoreAlamNa
if "D" = DRUGS, hmm, really? #ForevermoreAlamNa
ANONG LETTER "D"? DRUGS? DETENTION? WHATTHEHELL ako napapagod para kay Xander (i've been expecting this but ugh) #ForevermoreAlamNa
aling marites giving xander a once-over hahahahaha #ForevermoreAlamNa
OMAYGAD THAT LAST SEQUENCE NO GIVE XANDER A BREAK MY GOLLY (this show's about second chances, i know) #ForevermoreAlamNa
"pag may umalis, may darating." ano ba yan what should i expect??? magbabalik na sila agnes sa la presa? #ForevermoreAlamNa
aww lovers' chair!!! &lt;3 #ForevermoreAlamNa
ano ka ngayon, Jay? wala kang alam sa La Presa magic. see how far you are from the finish line? (but you're still good) #ForevermoreAlamNa
@jarimonty yes yes that! :))))
"it's okay to lose yourself in the clouds. alam mong andiyan sila kahit di mo nakikita."
saan banda'ng hugot niyan xander #ForevermoreAlamNa
@jarimonty i don't know kung saan napupulot ng creative team pero madalas may double meaning regarding the material of the episode haha =)))
pati mga sidekick may clash HAHAHAHAHA
"EPS." &lt;-- Orly
"ugly boy. ugly girl." &lt;-- boss ni Jay
#ForevermoreAlamNa
"in the service of the Filipino worldwide."
"tama na 'yan, mga eps."
THE WORD PLAY HAHAHAHAHA #ForeveremoreAlamNa
high-five naging holding hands! xander and agnes nasa system nyo pa talaga! sobrang spontaneous &amp; instinctive ng actions! #ForevermoreAlamNa
"Xander grew up na wala akong contribution sa buhay niya." &lt;-- shows just how much Bettina's changed! HAPPY ME #ForevermoreAlamNa
"Maybe he's busy writing his happy ending." AUNT MEG YOUUUU #ForevermoreAlamNa
agnes why do you always have to break good news like that but so cute the HUG! impulsive, instinctive nasa system mo pa! #ForevermoreAlamNa
shet! foreshadowing! Xander "is accomplished, successful, can move mountains," sabi ni Jay. but oh no here comes trouble! #ForevermoreAlamNa
oooh Mt. Pulag was mentioned HAHAHA but this sequence shows Diego's improving acting skills ha =))) #ForevermoreAlamNa
jusko yung kiss ni kuya bangky at aling aunor di ko kinaya HAHA ano kayang iniisip ni Hope nun nabilaukan tuloy si Xander #ForevermoreAlamNa
"Maraming namamatay sa pagkasamid."
"Ilan?"
"Dadagdagan mo pa? Alam mo namang kailangan kita."
#ForevermoreAlamNa
"That I can be a better alternative." Yes Jay, you're an alternative. Pero hanggang dun lang. But man, you're a good boy.
#ForevermoreAlamNa
I HATE POWER NAPS THEY DON'T EMPOWER ANYBODY THEY JUST MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY AND UGH i am rattled

#ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2 | XaGnes SecondChance
"mag-ingat ka riyan sa Makati. makati riyan."
"wag na kayong dadaang Pasay. maraming liku-liko run!"
PAPANG WHY
#ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
hi guys kung ayaw nyong mabasa mga tweet ko tungkol sa Forevermore mute nyo na lang hahahaha sorry (Mondays to Fridays, 9:30 PM to 12 MN)
okay enough of my feels and (non-legit) theories. but fantastic episode, as always! :)))) #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
bumalik na kayong PCU para makita ko ulit kayo pls tatakbuhin ko pa kahit galing UPM hahaha kidding (no, really) #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
"di mo ba ako i-invite sa taas? joke lang. kailangan ko kasing bumawi. yun lang naisip ko." oh please, xander. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
the big talk: medyo nakakainis din that it's been postponed for too long. but i have faith in the material. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
also thanks sa hindi pagpansin at pagpansin sa akin, groupmates. legit.
although setting aside the big agnes-xander talk bothers me, i'm very satisfied with how the story's unfolding. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
@lizasoberiano applauding you once more for a job well done! keep aiming high, you little star! :))))
i can see how madam soledad actually wants to show how she's changed and for that alone i am very happy =))) #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
maybe this riff between the san juans and grandes will finally get the la presans and grandes together /hoping/ #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
awang-awa na ako sa character ni Jay. someone should make it clear where he stands in agnes' heart. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
karen, you are one hell of an addition to the cast! finally, a very mature friend who can tap into agnes' soul! #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
tapos nung si Xander na yung pumasok (cue: squeal 'cause they're terno ulit) ngiti ni Agnes di mapigilan eh! #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
nung biglang si Jay yung bisita, hitsura ni Agnes. disappointed lang? HAHAHAHAHA this gurl #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
maybe i see a lot of myself in karen. i like her character very, very much. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
kare, you are one hell of an addition to the cast! finally, a very mature friend who can tap into agnes' soul! #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
oh please, Agnes. if i know. para nga lang ba sa proposal? anong ibig sabihin nung dreamy scene sa pool, eh? #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
that mention of "peste" and the Saavedras by the La Presa... is that foreshadowing?  #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
or maybe the PI Sheri's hired will stalk Prof. Xander and see him being all chummy with a student (Agnes)? #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
hi readers theatre groupmates 
hindi kaya mahalungkat yung issue sa la presa nung bumagsak siya sa trak at nakaperwisyo? hmmm... #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
if there's anything that they can put against xander, it'll be the days he was notoriously a douchebag. #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
xander is sheri's next target. i wonder how this will rattle the grandes and agnes. di kaya maging daan na ito? #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
guess it was too early for my much-desired bettina-agnes talk to happen. hmmmm... what are the writers cooking? #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
muli na ngang nabuksan ang puso ni Agnes. sana tuluy-tuloy na. i'm happy. =))) #ForevermoreMeetTheGrandes2
last na 'yun. goodnight guyzzzzzzzzZZZZZzzzzzZZZZ
and maybe deconstructing every episode is a self-fulfillment routine i don't get bored of. =))) #ForevermoreWalkAway
maybe me being all hyper when it comes to the show is a self-gratifying deed for the me that was never a biology major #ForevermoreWalkAway
this has been said before but i'm saying it again. the maturity of the material and characters made this show click. #ForevermoreWalkAway
i still wonder if there'll ever come a time when i don't doze off during postlab discussions. it's always a struggle not to. i dunno why.
EXACTLY! (RETWEETING THIS JUST BECAUSE!) 
iwantv anong problema :(((
so many kilig moments tonight that even as i press my eyes close i see them in the back of my eyelids is that weird #ForevermoreWalkAway

#ForevermoreWalkAway 
LizQuen Is Primetime Royalty 
@CJ_4u i am!!! hahahahaha! (ang adik!)
@CJ_4u yup!!! nakanood ako sa sala ng dorm hahahaha
that reminiscing in the pool, getting lost while staring at his face... kaiyak lang yung flashbacks eh #ForevermoreWalkAway
"Nagta-trabaho tayo dahil a part of us actually cares." Oh, Xander. #ForevermoreWalkAway
true, medyo mali nga rin na nilalandi ni xander si agnes considering the tutelage hahahahahaha but well it happens #ForevermoreWalkAway
now that agnes is bound to meet the grandes, who says the agnes-bettina talk should happen? to provide her perspective? #ForevermoreWalkAway
grandes being excited to see agnes + agnes trying to sneak out + xander helping her to sneak out = mission FAILED <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #ForevermoreWalkAway
jay, though, he is very very miserable. and i feel for him. <TIRED FACE> this has been done before but i still don't understand #ForevermoreWalkAway
AND WHEN THEY SHOWED UP WEARING THE SAME SHIRT COLOR MYGOSH #ForevermoreWalkAway  
tuesday pa lang naman. guess we should all watch out for the next episodes. you know the writers' drill. #ForevermoreWalkAway
@chickoruiz hahahahahahaha
they both walked away. Xander from being blinded, finally snapping out of it and Agnes from trying to be insufferable <FISTED HAND SIGN> #ForevermoreWalkAway
this episode is one of the best of book 2, more defining XAgnes moments than I can recall! #ForevermoreWalkAway
#ForevermoreWalkAway napaka-mature ng show na 'to! kaya ko gusto eh. kitams, differences were set aside, they dealt with what matters now.
here was no BIG confrontation tonight just as i'd thought. because immediate matter = proposal. shows their maturity:) #ForevermoreWalkAway
guess Agnes has finally walked away from trying to close in on herself. that reminiscing in the pool proved it. #ForevermoreWalkAway
all Xander had to do was present to her the most immediate matter: yung pangarap //nila// and there goes Agnes' qualms #ForevermoreWalkAway
mukhang sa iwantv na ako makakanood huhu crei #ForevermoreWalkAway
YEHEY 1,000,044!!!! WE DID IT WE DID IT WE DID IT! #ForevermoreWalkAway
inaantok na ako
999,527 views what is this sorcery guys!!! #ForevermoreWalkAway
wait lang what is this #ForevermoreWalkAway 
this hashtag alone is already breaking my heart :(((( #ForevermoreWalkAway
i was already having a bad day at school staring into blank space while there are reports why must i come home to this #ForevermoreWalkAway
so i was talking to my friend @CJ_4u. just had to share this discovery.
ano kayang mangyayari?<ANGUISHED FACE> #ForevermoreDeadline 
@jarimonty more like proposal adviser hahahaha =))) a month pa siguro bago matapos, nothing definite. :)))
@jarimonty hahaha no hindi pa! may kailangan lang tapusing proposal si agnes and xander =))) (i didn't know you watch it???)
hi @jarimonty wala lang you're awesome <TWO HEARTS>
okay so i think i'll have to catch up with the worksheets na. goodnight, my friends and new friends sa twitter (and sa realidad)!
@paoacflores I AM, TOO! <FISTED HAND SIGN><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
sumabog timeline and notifs ko wow! #ForevermoreDeadline
a wonderful episode! kudos to the writers, the top-billing actors @itsenriquegil @lizasoberano and the supporting cast! #ForevermoreDeadline
@Lizquenatic @LIZQUEN_GLOBAL @emmy_morley another truth! see, the story's slowly unfolding naman. mahirap lang talaga for agnes to open up.
@LIZQUEN_GLOBAL @paoacflores @emmy_morley oh no! believe me i read tweets all the time whenever i'm free indisposed and i'm always at awe! <FISTED HAND SIGN>
this deserves a retweet <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@paoacflores @LIZQUEN_GLOBAL @emmy_morley these intellectual discussions between perceptive fans are most gratifying! :)))
the truest statement of the night! kaya ako nage-enjoy every night eh! =)))))
i love the people of this fandom! 
@LIZQUEN_GLOBAL @emmy_morley totoo! omg why are you guys so amazingly perceptive?
@lizasoberano and @itsenriquegil you two are the best! &lt;3 #ForevermoreDeadline
@LIZQUEN_GLOBAL @emmy_morley ikaw ba naman gulatin nang ganun! :(((
@paoacflores @sofeimous hi, ate! kinikilig po ako! &lt;3
@sofeimous I ALREADY HAVE! :))) Hi, ate Pao @paoacflores! I've said this before but thank you for all the intelligible tweets! :))))
"Hindi ako magsasawang intindihin ka."
OMAYGAD IT ALL FITS
#ForevermoreDeadline 
i promise to devote one ass-long blog entry for this show when it ends as in magpapaka-dalubhasa ako #ForevermoreDeadline
amazing how agnes' character was written how she should act her age before and after she was broken. this show. #ForevermoreDeadline
@sketchbook88 yes! which we should all be happy about. at least we get to feel how real the characters are. affected kung affected! :)
omg intellectual debates in the fandom i am loving this! #ForevermoreDeadline
hindi ko alam kung saan galing ang hugot ko pero i understand where both xander and agnes are coming from #ForevermoreDeadline
@sketchbook88 which makes the story more believable isn't it? we know where both agnes and xander are coming from #ForevermoreDeadline
@janiaagnes I'M GONNA BRING THE MAG TOMORROW SO WE CAN FAN GIRL EVEN MORE!!!
think about it: at 17 Agnes fell hard for someone and he left her. that should hurt a lot and scar you for life! #ForevermoreDeadline
i'm not even angry with agnes. hey, she was hurt. she has every right to guard her heart. #ForevermoreDeadline
the bettina-agnes talk should happen. let the adults intervene. they've been the witnesses to their love after all. #ForevermoreDeadline
think about it. if a jaime-agnes talk will happen, i guess mas malaki ang impact nung sacrifice ni xander, right? #ForevermoreDeadline
nakakainis! sobrang talino nung pagkakasulat nung last gap i am confused if i should feel sad or happy.
#ForevermoreDeadline
i want the Bettina-Agnes talk to happen. it'll be a big plot-driving device. or even a Jaime-Agnes talk. #ForevermoreDeadline
"Mas lalong nagsasara. Kaya all you have to do is wait. Ika nga sa kasabihan, bubuka ang bulaklak~" #ForevermoreDeadline ORLY WHY
@CJ_4u GRABE YUNG LAST GAP TEH HUHU
@janiaagnes OMG JADE gusto kitang i-hug right now especially since i'm a mess after that last gap of tonight's episode! kumirot dibdib ko!
that last gap moved me to tears omaygad i'm still sniffing :(((( kudos, writers! you're amazing as always! #ForevermoreDeadline
@janiaagnes YES JADE! YES! OMG when i found a single first press copy sa newsstand i grabbed it! (di ko nga napansin sila chiz eh hahahaha)
my chest throbbed when the wallpaper was flashed. i feel for agnes too much. umiyak ako eh. #ForevermoreDeadline 
ngayon ko lang nalaman na 5-6 years tanda ni Xander kay Agnes (24 going on 25 si Xander tapos si Agnes 19) aww too real
#ForevermoreDeadline
Bettina: "Ang kapal din naman ng mukha mo-- Kaya please, patawarin mo na ang anak ko." MAMA BETTINA DI KO KINAYA HAHAHA #ForevermoreDeadline
@janiaagnes OMG JADE YOU READ IT I LOVE YOU TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!! (I ACTUALLY HAVE A COPY!)

skills and attributes should i just lump them in together
@Wishaatap you haven't seen even half of the things i do just to quell my raging fangirl feels hahahaha
EXACTLY butas ng ilong ni quenito lol 
so many feels for this show so many things i realize every single episode yes i am including the hashtag as credit #ForevermoreTheProposal
see how fictional stories reach beyond realities? they reach the dreams and fears we harbor in our sleep. #ForevermoreTheProposal
but the hurt and the heartbreak make you want to forget how real love can't really be fairytale happy all the time #ForevermoreTheProposal
you know what's amazing about the show? the kilig scenes make you want to fall in love (cont) #ForevermoreTheProposal
@happyriched well taking your statement out of context i feel you!!! sakit &lt;///3

so good morning.
saan man galing ang ihip ng hangin
mapuwing man ako ng buhangin
ang ngiting ito'y may munting pag-amin

light bulb moment i need to write it down but i can't spend 4++ hours on doing that since i need to study so i'm tweeting this to remember
okay 11PM na study na byebye
hahahaha @AnnaVeee just so you know :))))
@bajooy ALAM KO 'TO! TAGOS SA PUSO!!!
whenever people tell me, "ro, you look like a prof." i say, "thank you."

'cause isn't just that one of the best things to be in life
@AnnaVeee oh ate i watch it sa iwantv (di kayang tiisin) and haha sorry this is me feeling like an expert XD HAHAHA but really...
OK RO STOP NA back to studying
i understand how agnes first needs to be whole. she needs healing before she could give her heart once again. #ForevermoreTheAdviser
i actually like where this story's going. you get to see how both men struggle to be whole before they take a chance. #ForevermoreTheAdviser
okay medyo relate na relate sa FM episode ngayon i can actually see myself in jay and xander which is weird.
in love you have to be whole. in love you should be capable of giving and willing to receive. you can't be miserable. #ForevermoreTheAdviser
xander had to fix the sins of his past. so is jay. he has to fix his present issues before he could give her love. #ForevemoreTheAdviser
judy, it's not healthy to distract jay from more pressing matters just so he could win agnes. love is patient. #ForevermoreTheAdviser
pwede kay agnes whut #ForevermoreTheAdviser @PoemsPorn: “You have to keep breaking your heart until it opens.”
nakatapat na sa akin yung electric fan at number 3 how are beads of sweat having a rollover frenzy over my belly

@mitchiemnsyc eh bakit "o?"? HAHAHAHA
@mitchiemnsyc may picture HAHAHAHA
@mitchiemnsyc 
oh hi sigh
this thoughts string proves how the inner workings of my heart desired for a literary program in college but this isn't the ideal world so
okay enough of that. maybe i'll just write something. i dunno. maybe. maybe.
how i hope forevermore ends in a more realistic, smart note. but i have faith. i do.
that after months of building up the jao-mikay love story the series took a turn for the worst just to assuage consumer desires
i still feel sorry for the character jao, never having been given the chance to explain himself (and for quen, for his talent put to waste)
the writers were deprived of literary license since hormone-driven fans of KN demanded that daniel end up with kathryn (not gino or mikay)
because apparently, pai had been very interesting in the beginning and kathryn's prowess was brought out whenever she had scenes with quen
now i think enrique could actually bring out the best from his leading ladies
but there are actual valuable insights i haven't taken to checking on the internet before (since 2 years ago i was as active as a box)
i'm taking a break from reading journals for my related lit and why am i reading from this reactions page on princess and i's ending
i will forever treasure this piece of gold. "The Real POGI PROBLEMS: 
not to mention the oftentimes--thank goodness--intellectual debate down on the comments section

HAPPY BIRTHDAY ATE @itscarlawithaC!!! GOD BLESS YOU!!! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><TWO HEARTS>
@nacvaldez OO :(((( team-teach sila ni Ma'am Ng. (pero shet ang galing niya)
ma'am rochelle you are one sweet teacher i hope there are more teachers like you in college 'cause your kind prevents us from breaking
OK STOP NA go rewrite your notes ma'am DV discusses at such rapid-fire pace that you can only laugh at how pathetic a note taker you are
(4/4) not that i'm any expert in this matter. just a thought.
(3/4) time is a fickle friend and it's a pain to see the actors being pushed to the point of breaking; they are human after all.
(2/4) that no matter how big a show is the production team should make it an effort to bank episodes before actual air date
(1/4) although i commend the FM team for being able to ride out hope's absence with strategic flashbacks, i guess this serves as a lesson
kitang kita run sa video na masama pa pakiramdam ni bebe hope. get well soon, gorg!!! buti the FM team was able to cover up your absence.
puro flashback lang yun pero huhuhu kakakilig #ForevermoreHope
