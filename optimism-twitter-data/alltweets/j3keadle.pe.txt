Haven't seen some of my friends in forever.
Already out fishing these guys! a_u_s_t_i_n__m_a_r_t_i_n_ and dad #minnow 
I just wish I could find Flash.
I know someone took Flash, I just know it. It was my stupid drug head neighbors.
I have been so lazy today.
Me and Kelo just being bored. 
Almost had my car for 3 years now. 2 more days
My basset hound, flash went missing yesterday, she looks like this and is white with brown all over… 
I just hate that my teacher actually thinks I plagiarized. Never done it in my life so why would I start now and put my career in jeopardy?
Why can't I ever sleep?
Tomorrow should be interesting.
My physics teacher is so stupid it's not even funny.
My girlfriend is another huge impact in my life, blessed to have her.
I literally do not think my dad could be any more of a critical part of my life. He helps me through everything! #bestdadever
I hate pool.
lt, something else and stupid.
If you don't care about the killing of these police officers putting their lives on the line for you every single day then you are truly
Definitely not the biggest but it's the first catfish of the year. Just glad me and… 
Love my woman @lizzz_da
My doggy looks so pretty! #huskies #husky 
My #wcw is when I take random pictures of her and she doesn't even know it, she's the best. @lizzz_da

Gave out 16 assignments today, 6 due by Friday. Good job schedl. No one take him.
So tired of homework, time to sleep just to wake up and do some more of it.
I don't think it's possible for this teacher to assign anymore work.
Traffic sucks
Love being late to everything.. Not
My night was great to build a fire and spend it with all of these people. They all had a good time… 
That was a good one lol

Fav for the Doomsday Killer

Bob Evans sucks.
Really hope I can do something about that quiz.
Wow then the online program goes down on me at the beginning of a quiz. Awesome.
So tired of pulling other people's weight, I'm done doing it.
The ending of fast and furious 7 was great. But the entire movie was good. Great tribute to Paul Walker.
I hate when people don't even try and they are good at it.
Kelo and Jay being lazy like normal. 
Guess I did let my team down yesterday tho. Lost 3 games now in just 4 years. Get em in the playoffs
After today I hate my soccer team.
Need some players for an 18+ soccer league at the y for just a day. Sunday at 3 we are short and need a couple. Anyone?
Anyone wanna go to the y?
Pizza rolls for lunch! <THUMBS UP SIGN>

What I saw today! Oh my. 
Guess I'm not wanting to be talked too tonight.
Bad things always happen to me.
Kinda wanna go to the Jason Aldean concert.
This teacher is killing me and the bad thing is he is my advisor too.
There's no way I only got 29 out of 50 on that quiz, I got all the answers from the book. Something's wrong in that grade book.
Wow... Smh.
Hope I'll pass tomorrow.
Hate paying for classes that I don't know anything in and am not learning anything in.
People... Smh
Nothing today was good except for my soccer game.
@TheBrandonSlack sounds good dude that's when I'll be on too.
@TheBrandonSlack dude that sucks lol I'll be on tomorrow for sure tho

Went out and shot the 9mm again today. 
Literally cannot sleep
Me and @TheBrandonSlack need to find an outdoor team to play for again.
Like for real the team I play for is one of the best.
This weekend was hard, need to study for history and I'm gonna regret it when I don't.

All other players in Europe's top 5 leagues in that time have 6 combin…
Today has been terrible.
@_BritiniMarie_ I better be the god father
I have to get this history study guide done and I am becoming really lazy. Want out already.
The heat need to start winning again. They are still a good team but I mean come on.
Physics is insanely hard. Dont ever take it. Can't keep this grade up.
Literally hate the government.
Thanks to my manager for letting me off I was able to get homework done. Thanks joe.
Make more in a year get less back. Awesome. Now I know not to work. Then I'll have money
And I have more homework great!
Apparently when you earn more money in a year you get less back. Thanks Obama
I hate taxes!!
Just need to sleep.
I think I may be wanting to much for the man cave.
Got the first shots in today with the new 9mm, shoots good, I'm a little off tho but going to work on it. 
Time to spend money <UNAMUSED FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
Kelo won't quit staring at my window because of a bird, the bird keeps hitting the window and is… 
Thanks to my girl for my awesome new man cave sign! 
@lizzz_da you don't, I love you.
I couldn't be more aggravated right now.
Hate this.
This is just stupid. Like thanks dad for not letting me leave at all. Appreciated
I want a camaro so bad.
Bummed out too that I can't go to my concealed class tomorrow. Only because of weather and a soccer game. Good thing there will be more.
Kinda hated not working all week, but loved it at the same time. Bobs needs better employees and better managers.
People are really something. It's so funny.
So excited about my new gun, 9mm, thanks to my dad and sister for the birthday present! 
My #wcw she's amazing, there's no other word for her. Thanks for everything! @lizzz_da 
      - John F. Kennedy
Teachers that actually try and help you are the best ones.
School has me going crazy with work right now.
The fact that I didn't get to watch the walking dead tonight makes me really mad.
Finally get to go out with my girl on Valentine's Day, it's about time. I love you <GROWING HEART><FACE THROWING A KISS> @lizzz_da
Finally got a descent squad on ultimate team. 
In the arena! 
Ready for this heat game! heatnation 
@lizzz_da @BabyAnimalPics that's so my dog
I hate having so much acne....
I hate myself sometimes.
If you don't drink coffee or energy drinks you aren't a true college student.
Any one know how to use a dichotomous key??
Lost the game yesterday, unlucky on the teams part, but I think I played some great defense too. Get em in the playoffs.
Some of states professors are going to kill me this semester.
Well the school work is almost done for now. Or until I go to class.
So much school work to do, it's ridiculous.
What cats? #iFunny 
Loved getting to bowl today with my girl. @lizzz_da
These girls at this bowling alley right now lol <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hate when teachers say they are going to do something then don't.
My #wcw sleeping at my house the other day lol love Ya babe @lizzz_da <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Seahawks players get fined so much it's crazy.
I hate school.
My girlfriend could not get any better.
Need to just calm down.
I do fail.

I will keep evolving.

#Motivation
I'm not a Seahawks fan, Saints are my team, but still the Seahawks had it won there at the end and should've ran it with the beast. Bad call
Just can't believe that. They had it won.
Why would you make that play call? You have Lynch run it in from a yard out. Ridiculous.
I hate bob evans and its management and pretty much all the waiting staff.

Since then the Mavericks are on a 37-2 run.
Just....

Yes. That Pat Riley.
@aaaasshley_ awesome lol
My #wcw and everyday of corse, she's so gorgeous, and I love spending every second I can with her.… 
Will things ever happen?
School sucks.
I'm not gonna sleep all night and then I get to do more homework whenever I actually decide to get up.
Some things are good and others are bad, I'm such a pessimist.
I wish I wouldn't see some things.
@TheBrandonSlack heard that!
Team is 3-0 right now. Doing good but gotta keep it up.
Dexter ended terribly. They need to continue that series.
If this professor could assign anymore work I might be impressed.
@TheBrandonSlack seriously!
Ready for the NFL? #iFunny 
Bowling with my favorite a few hours ago :) love her. 
Wishing I could something right.
I hate reading school books!
My girlfriend makes everything better. Don't know what I would do without her.
My #wcw all the time, so nice and gorgeous, love ya <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ @lizzz_da 
How will I survive this semester...
Wish I could be better
Cleaned inside and out. Looking good again. 
This semester is just totally going to suck. I can tell already.
This is gonna be so hard.
Going to be extremely hard. Like I'm already panicking and it's not even started yet.
Idk how I'm going to be able to pass all my classes this semester it will be by far the hardest yet. I'm so screwed.
And then fail it
Like I actually wanted to get this assignment done so i wouldn't have to deal with it but looks like I have no choice to not do it or guess.
I think some professors try and ruin your life.
Russell Wilson hits Jermaine Kearse for the 35-yard TD. Seattle wins on a walk-off …
Marshawn Lynch with the 24-yard TD. Seattle takes the lead with 1:25 left.
WOW!!!
Why do I try?
@xxlyssaleannxx you won't regret it
Best car at the car show, cannot wait to have one of my own someday. 
I don't get why parents want to buy their 16/17 year old children these faster cars with the bigger engines. We all know the outcome.
Sugar free sugar #iFunny 
There are people that if they didn't work here this place would actually be something. Unfortunately there are druggies that do nothing.
I don't wanna get up for work.

I'm still upset that I can't coach this season. It bums me out bad.
Ocharleys with babe before work.

Me:

The smallest things make me the happiest tho.
Like why?
Did all that for nothing.
Freaking cabelas fails again. Wanted that .17 so bad.
Lynch being fined for not talking to the media is stupid and ridiculous. Not like it's a big deal, lay off the guy.
Thank you to @lizzz_da for seeing me today, I really appreciate it. Merry Christmas babe, love Ya.

At the same time tho, it's been kinda crappy.

Also realizing I put up with a lot of crap for the past few years when I could've had someone so much better.
Regret so much in my past, but looking now I turned out okay.

My harder classes are the ones I excel in the most, the easy ones I am not good at. #college
I get really bored in class. I feel like these classes are easy but they purposely try and make them hard.
