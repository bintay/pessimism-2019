@ventdoll @rositastef exactly right!  Tories peddled that mesaage and people swallowed it
@ventdoll @rositastef we need something that people can identify with appreciate and join in with
Even tho Im not Tory Reckless got his just rewards Turn coats dont cut it with me hiding behind principles a complete miscalculation there
@AJohnColes no we just need  to get it right with rank and file with the right delivery for the eletorate
@ventdoll @rositastef All the crap about Cameron being out of touch come home to roost We out of touch result reinforces that
@ventdoll @rositastef there is stillo a need for an effective and positivealtemative not a luke warm reflection come mirror image diff tint
@paul8ar @rositastef no point in us pumping ou  the same old mantra by rote it lost us an election time to reform!!
@paul8ar @rositastef yes right but we were totally ineffective we are out of touch with reality electorate sent us  the message
@ventdoll @rositastef root &amp; branch reform front intouch with the back and sides represnting us not ideology they lost sight of us
@pgo1980 &amp; regardless of all that they won they are in and were left swinging in the wind like a bunch of spares...time  to reform
@alain_hardy and people decided that was worth voting for as we didnt really offer a viable alternative no-.one buying what we peddled!
@17soulable it will be interesting to see the Tories belt all the crap thru at a  pace  to shower rose petals and dreams at the end again
@ventdoll @rositastef  do you think? I think we were peddling nothing any 1 wanted &amp; our negitivity got us absloutly nothing no alternatives
Am I tough enough hell yes and mealts away the next day...simply fades away Here today gone tomorrow  career politicians

The biggest load of cobblers of this election  The Polls clueless not worth anything witch doctors potions...lets hope they get flushed away
Alexander just seemed to mealt away and no-one even noticed and boy did he trot out the ole Tory line in every interview
@AJohnColes yes all of that BUT also we were peddlig what people didnt want we need to look at our selves and sort our own house out first
@sarahsmate well yes maybe but need to get our own house in order and identfy what politcs needs and what  people want from politics
what happened to @Edsinturn   harikiri?

@pipehugger yes agan agree he just didnt cut it for me the "Flipant none of it previously my fault" Balls total off  message grated mostly
@pipehugger never forcefull enough or come out guns blazing on a lot of what I percived to be  out and out corruption maybe i was wrong!
@pipehugger yes afraid i have to agree with that despite my best efforts he did have empathy  &amp; intelligence but screwed right up
restore hunting and will  Cameron give Clarkson a knighthood all distinct possibilites now   :-(
Miliband tells us he' will never ever give up or cease fight Hes just quit  DUH  all hollow empty words cut and run politics

@pabmanjo @teapotchapman Btrandishing  Communism in the democraatic  UK is just more Tory demonization and BS a non starter from the start
@henrietta6 HiClaire yes kinnock was right in a lot of areas unfortuneatly he was just as much of a goon s Cameron is ...alas!
#bbcdpdebate Morgan spouting the spending billions on education challenged about where'sit coming from answers announced yesterday no answer

@pabmanjo @teapotchapman yes Tories forked tounge campaign for anti indepence democracy and deny it when it happens typical
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman Sorry telegraph journo Im getting my Toilet rolls muddled up
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman The Times Journo claims they do IFS dont back anyone they just inravel the lies and BS from all of it
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman just to remind you the IFS verdict on Osbornes budget was fantasy Finances !!
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman more fantasy IFS are not backing anyone they are trying to explain the smoke and mirrors in all of it
@pabmanjo Thankfully more people dont read the telegraph than do....  ;-)
@pabmanjo bad day to be tory Cameron hacked to pieces by real people non BBC didnt even lknow how much the living wage was....
@pabmanjo @teapotchapma not some  Biased Tory toilet roll journo she was from the IFS not making it up about  the IFS
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman ON TV today spokesperson said both parties leave too many unasnwered on cuts labour magianally more that Tories -
@pabmanjo @teapotchapman no it aint its the usual feast of scaremongering and demonisation not the democracy he campained for anti.indy
@ChaabanRabih except on Radio 1 where he had to face real people and came to a spluttering halt accused them of being lefties!!
