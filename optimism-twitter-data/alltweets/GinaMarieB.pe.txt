I want food, but everthing on and off campus is closed. I guess I'll starve until 7 am <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@brookie_taylor_ I'm glad it's going good. Busy work is the worst lol. I hope you're okay, Brooke.
@brookie_taylor_ I've been good. I have work in two hours until 7, not excited lol. How is college life?
@_SincerelyKat I just didn't want you to think I unfollowed you lol. I missss youuuu<HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@brookie_taylor_ Awwww, you're so sweet! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> How have you been?
I promise, Im really not as bitchy as I appear to be. When you get to know me, I'm actually a good listener and I'll always be here for you.
I wish Tyler didn't have to be so far away... <PENSIVE FACE>
I always get asked to teach people smoke tricks <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><DASH SYMBOL>

@_SincerelyKat I have no idea how it happened, but somehow I unfollowed you <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
Just awkwardly found out my ex unblocked me on facebook. Do I block him or nah
You're irrelevant.
Is it weird I find dubstep relaxing?

That one asshole in the class who thinks they know more than the professor, and then starts an unintelligent debate with them... <UNAMUSED FACE>
@MarissaHalme Lol I hate you
@MarissaHalme Lol not yet. I need to go to AT&amp;T tomorrow and get my Sim card transfered then I can!
@MarissaHalme Yasssss

lol, stop you're annoying
We're the fucking animals
You really don't need to ask me about every aspect of my life, it's none of your business.
I always listen to Frank Sinatra because it reminds me of my grandpa
anxiety, can you not
I'm probably the most selfish and conceited person you will ever meet.
I'm trying to work on that.
I only talk to like two of my high school friends. I can't tell if I think that's sad or irrelevant
I hate it when people think it's their right to interrogate you because you don't want to go somewhere with them. #NoMeansNo
For how expensive tuition is, room service should be included once it starts getting cold

@80toYpsi Hot Tea is a really good idea. I'll probably make some before I go to work. I've been living off pizza for the past few days lol.
To everyone else it's just a place, to me it's my old life and it's filled with memories
@80toYpsi Not when you're sick.
Just so everyone knows, I have a super fabulous suite mate and I get so excited when she comes back on Sundays @Sara_Thompson26
Time to take a well deserved Netflix break
If you're my friend, you're not ugly. I don't have ugly friends.
Someone come bring me some hot soup and orange juice please
Hopefully I will be able to stay awake until 7 am
@80toYpsi Yeahhhh. I like her, but she irritates me
It kinda irritates me that my roommate has the "My daddy will pay for it" kind of attitude.
Working my first night watch shift tonight at Hill...gonna be so boring
<BLACK SUN WITH RAYS><SUNFLOWER> 
Don't expect me to be able to pretend to like someone because I'm awful at it. If I dislike you, it's usually very obvious.
Two jobs, 16 credit hours, and staying involved on campus. I got this
I always have the weirdest dreams #wtf
The best feeling in the world is getting everything done that you wanted to get done
fucking sick of all this goddamn create writing homework
Eva so does not deserve Matty
I have no pity for cheaters.
Goals. 
Lol, I thought parents were supposed to help you, not make your life more difficult.
Someone come rub my back please.
2 books are put in front of u
one has every good thought everyone has had of u
one has every bad thought

Which one do u pick?
I love spending time with Tyler. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me
Nothing is better than cold pizza
@RaiAllen12 I miss your face
So hungry, my own stomach is digesting itself

It's really hard not to be judgmental.
@SecretlyAmazin1 Hey girl! I'm free after 9:30 tomorrow lol. Idk about @Man_heCOLDD
My biggest flaw is that I get pissed off so easily.

Working two jobs and 16 credit hours next semester, I hope I have time for a social life.
The quickest way to get on my nerves is to keep re-asking me the same question over and over again
UGH I WANT A KITTEN SO BADLY
"Our brains are sick, but that's okay."
Lmao, you @Paztacular 
So tired, wna MeowChat? — Lol idk what a MeowChat is either

You know you're not best friends anymore when you take them off your close friends list on facebook
I heart you @TylerScottTromb
@jordanbroecker That kitten is seriously wayyyy too cute! lol
It's sad when a couple's relationship is so toxic, and everyone can see it but them
I'm always paranoid that I have a secret mustache or awkward facial hair that I never notice and ppl are too embarassed to tell me about it
@MarissaHalme Move in time for me is between 3pm and 5pm. Is that going to be too late? I'll probably be moving in around 4
I'm so excited to meet my roommate
If you could change one thing about your boyfriend what would it b... — I wouldn't change anything. He's wonderful. 
Half of the time I don't even know why I'm sad
My greatest flaw is that sometimes I say the meanest things, and I don't realize how hurtful they are until it's too late
I Miss You by Blink 182 always makes me sad, but I still love this song.
Watching Aladdin... the feels...
"You're free, Genie"
These cramps are so bad right now I literally want to cry

It's annoying when people say "you know who"
Want you so bad I can taste it,
but you're nowhere to be found.
I'll take a drug to replace it,
or put me in the ground. 
#Placebo
Feeling nostalgic and not liking it
Always feeling like it's me vs. myself...
One of your friends who was in my class last year retweeted you ... — Interesting. I'm surprised you recognized me. 
RIP Robin Williams...
At a nightclub. — Really? How did you find me on social media stuff? 
She will be loved by Maroon 5 is the perfect song to be played on this rainy day
You are truly one of a kind. No wonder I'm crazy about you. — Sooo. who are you? 
So both of those are apt compliments in your book? — I suppose 
There isn't really a way to take those comments about... — I think that is just a matter of opinion of whomever ... 
I want pizza with extra extra cheese
Snapchat me | ginabinafofina
Your a beautiful. Be my girl — I already have a boyfriend. But thanks for the compliment! 
I have no interest in participating in life anymore.
@MarissaHalme Tell Colton once school starts you and I are having a sleep over one night a week so he can prepare himself lol.
Haha well you guys are super cute!!! — Aw, thanks stranger :) 
Send me friend request please :) , I accept everyone .. 
OMG so cute! How long has it been? — A year and seven months :) 
Are you and Tyler still dating? — Yes :) 
What's one common thing that people do that frustrate... — I hate it when people assume things instead of ask. O... 
Your a Q T 3.14 — Lol, you're clever. 
Boooooooobies!!!!! — Are nice. 
Nice

“@BabyAnimalPics: smiling baby penguin <PENGUIN> 
And you say sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
What's a good compliment for you? — Honestly, compliments make me uncomfortable. 
I'm definitely not looking forward to buying books for this upcoming semester...
I still adore Adele's voice
I hate disloyal people.
Here's some advice on trying to be friends with your ex:

Don't.
I just don't understand why I'm never satisfied with anything
Have you ever had to delete someones comment because ... — Not in my current relationship, but I know I had to w... 
If you're going to be a whore, then maybe you should be single.
I don't understand why men are constantly obsessed with sex. It's annoying.
That's okay, I don't really like people anyway
Are you excited for your first semester of college? (: @_catherinemaree
What does it take for you to be interested enough in ... — I like people who have deep conversations with me and... 
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Deep down, I wish my mom was in my life more and I wish my parents were still married and still in love
I could get three hours of sleep, I could get nine hours of sleep, but no matter what I'm still tired! 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
I'm starting to hate 5am shifts...
And I have them all next week for the third week in a row...
