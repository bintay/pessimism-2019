@paulgibbins mm, true - why the hell wasn't he saying it all a month ago
@paulgibbins yah i agree, but what he says when resigning is very true - talks about fear vs liberalism and liberalism losing rn
only just watching clegg's resignation speech where tf was this guy 2010-2015
@ToonArmyMIA @Telegraph talking about "bad losers" - it's not a game, it's people's lives

@paulgibbins the resigned stress in the guy's voice at the start <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@rammlet exactly, they need to flush and reset their brains, not be told they're right!
@IBWMJeff @MsiDouglas get on board mark, only way to change it - 200k members and 70k in past week - i reckon most will be more left
there's your hit-list
"modernising"
serious scope for a radical left candidate with hunt umunna and kendall splitting the "moderniser" vote
this is lunacy 
@paulgibbins christ, he was. that is unreal
@paulgibbins both hated already so nowt to lose by handing them the most toxic remits
@paulgibbins ids too
ie. "i don't give af about the poor"
"anti-enterprise"
"anti-business"
sugar resigns from labour party to spend more time burrowing 
@Lord_Sugar good riddance
only way to stop mandelson and blair's chuka coronation
only way to get a say in the leader
could i endorse that apostrophe tho
@Clusks @Chateau_Nouveau better than anyone we currently have regardless
minister for equality stepping up would certainly be apt
@IBWMJeff independent is dead to me
@paulgibbins weekend hiding in the lakes, im still not ready for it tbh, wallowing like a right baby <PENSIVE FACE>
@IBWMJeff ok i like her but she's never going to get it with mandelson and blair terrifying everyone

@samuelevolpe yup, toxic awful man
@IBWMJeff tainted by brown association? he's very good speaker tho, who knows, couldn't stand ed a yr ago
@alexkilcranx @tash_wynarczyk ffs man i can't handle 5yrs of this
@IBWMJeff gdp..? hmmm what a tease
mandelson christ

there are far too many too rich people that's the whole problem
blairite money-loving nonsense from chuka 
@IBWMJeff very illusive.. creasey?

@tash_wynarczyk ive hid in the lake district this weekend and i am now solidly depressed after bingeing on news and comment

flick open laptop this is the first thing i see 
only just back from a brain flush in the lakes
@damnson probably in france <PENSIVE FACE>
@damnson let the riot be the rhyme or the unheard - if I lived on london and not a tiny village id be all over the riots
@IBWMJeff don't give away yet
harrison stickle ascent today pretty sick

i'm staying here
election didn't even happen in langdale it seems
@AdamClery aye get some money out
@gibbyobertan companies like barclays etc will have them, train you on the job.. abandon your morals first obv
@gibbyobertan tbh with your degree just go work in the city on graduate scheme, earn 100k in 2 years
in a pub full of pretty loose and sour-looking men and pretty sure i currently look the least approachable
@MsiDouglas cause he's a total coward despite his macho bluster
@mark_wardle @IBWMJeff don't get me wrong, both exist, I'm just appalled at what this says about my fellow citizens.
@gibbyobertan was in 2006 pet, let alone now
@mark_wardle @IBWMJeff im not having the electorate let off like some sort of docile cow, many of them sane people - just without a heart
@IBWMJeff some, but many are just compassionless morally-bankrupt scum
@edgardavidsgeps yup thats next
that's me done for the week
looks like he's been in a room shouting "fuck off" for 3 hours
brand is totally bewildered in that trews - aren't we all mate
boss just brought me this to "cheer me up" i must look sick of my life <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@gibbyobertan wouldn't have won with all the seats tho ms maths
@ScottWalker1984 me too mate, looking forward to oblivion later
bizarre to see commenters like owen on the left hammering the party - to scared to call out out morally-bankrupt electorate for what it is
@OwenJones84 you're being far too hard on the party and not hard enough on the shameful morally-bankrupt electorate, man
@rammlet thanks mate i'm fucking furious with the world today - not their party, or my party, but them
spend your paltry tax-cut blood money on a new tv or some other meaningless needless shit - let that drown out your conscience
look after #1
as long as middle england has a bit more holiday spending money; rich do what you like, and fuck the needy
we are a nation of selfish, insular, scared, cynical, and spineless tossers but noone will say it
it's not the parties that are the problems but the electorate
the problem, and why lab didn't win, is simply the country's mentality is fucked
im not having that irvine welsh tweet fully - there's a point to be made like that, but it's not as bad as he makes it sound
@IrvineWelsh @Low_Noise it's the voters that don't believe in anything, a nation of selfish cynical cunts, we got what we deserved
he looks furious tbh
ed up now
@MsiDouglas @footyramblings @IBWMJeff even full price like for me it's 2 pints a month for a say in the leader
@IBWMJeff @MsiDouglas £5 a month having just cancelled my st @ £35/month..
@IBWMJeff @MsiDouglas exactly!!
@IBWMJeff @MsiDouglas can start with this 
my fb post that i pasted into "why you are joining labour party" box when signing up 
@Steeeks or a plane flying into it, anything
@Ed_Miliband you did nearly everything right fam, it's the electorate that's the problem not you
that cameron mobile phone video, im wishing the floor to collapse like that wedding video every time i see it 

twats
yes he's a prick obv
no joy from another tory seat closer to majority government tbh
if you want to pull this lot to the left get signed up and drag them yourself with your leadership vote
@rammlet ha get the fuck in mate
we go again 
329 (majority) being called now man <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
live stream of ed address after resigning looks possible this might put me over the edge tbh
@Bank_shots_ christ im depressed lol
@tash_wynarczyk can't think who though <PENSIVE FACE>
ed expected to resign <VICTORY HAND>️<PENSIVE FACE>
@RockcliffeFiles tory and ain't even subtle about it
@gillesoffthenet @billyjoelismint @rustyrockets plenty time to change voters minds who may have been considering green
lol and the millennium bridge is up so im going to be even later for work
@gillesoffthenet im not sure that's true tbh
@gillesoffthenet the reason we lost was not because of him but because of the moral bankruptcy of middle england. Tories have been voted IN.
@dinosaur_world just bodied it on fb
@gillesoffthenet @rustyrockets you can't be serious?

RBS +5.75%
Barclays +4.16%
HSBC +1.27%
Lloyds +6.59%

Want a real revolution?

in other news ive literally missed the bus cracking day so far <NEUTRAL FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN>
that's yer man
what price middle-england's conscience? few hundred quid extra a year get the fuck out of here
cause they're going to fucking need it
any paltry increase in my money cause of tokenistic tax changes is going straight to the food bank
what you going to spend your blood money on?
those with decent jobs probably going to be a couple of hundred quid a year better off
@OwenJones84 seriously hope you've got some good ideas of how to sort this clusterfuck out mate because i am at a loss
@TheMightySteve getting it all out now so i don't get sacked tbh couldn't give af about offending!
seriously going to have to watch what i say at work
@tash_wynarczyk is that first? im well in it too
moving through all the stages
fucking furious with everyone now
most moral election i can remember and all it shows is most people is this country are morally bankrupt and utterly despicable cunts
how can you run a campaign on issues of fairness and equality then get beat by a party that serves millionaires and punishes the poor
@KTD89 @paz_parish @RockcliffeFiles it starves to death
@RockcliffeFiles @KTD89 absolutely sickening and i think you're bang on
how bad have things actually got to get?
@KTD89 are you mad? further left?!
horrific 
christ thats some bleak reading
@tash_wynarczyk yup me too, what's worse is i can't blame the leader, it's a rejection of actual principles of the left <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@DanielSandison he looks terrible
@tash_wynarczyk feel genuinely and deeply depressed about so many things rn
democracy is an absolute con when people cheapen the right to vote with such ignorance and selfishness
another opportunity for brainless mopes to fuck us all
eu referendum next fuhuck me
i feel sick
so many so fucked by so many so stupid
@DanielSandison galling galling night
im genuinely staggered - imo the campaign was pitched perfectly what the fuck actually happened?
do people have absolutely no moral core
a nation of greedy selfish evil cunts tf with the lot of you
what a fucking disaster im genuinely astonished
well fuck me
@tash_wynarczyk I'm sacking it off til like 5 now it's too depressing, holding on to my hope tho <VICTORY HAND>️
@tash_wynarczyk praying hard <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

@IBWMJeff loads i know blame them for propping up torys and came back to lab! the lib to con switch is baffling

we're about three elections off v for vendetta at this rate
@KTD89 d miliband fuck off mate you're on mute til june soz
that party has mobilised a moronic swathe of population that doesn't even deserve the vote they're so stupid
amount of ukip votes is staggering

22,000 surveyed by that exit poll.

That's 0.03%.

Put the kettle on.
imagine being one of these smug prick pollsters why tf are they being given so much airtime
@KTD89 you're mad
@adamf2384 time and a half according to @damnson
bbc finally now reporting the yougov numbers
hope gove gets hit by a bus tomorrow
treating myself to a mouthful of can
@SiGallagher so it seems aye
gwan girl one nil
@mark_brophy exactly, so cynical, disgusting undermining of democracy
surely this bbc one can't be the best my foots about to go through tv
what channel has best coverage on?
bbc commissioned this poll and clearly taking the strategy to delegitimise left-wing majority through it
ive stopped drinking for now

CON = 280

LAB = 274

LIB DEM = 21

SNP = 52
bbc yet to report the 284/263 yougov poll
@_MikeEdwards strong
people will fucking die if these lot stay in, and it sadly wont be cameron and osborne
sweepstake on how long it takes bbc to report yougov exit poll
Con 284, 
Lab 263, 
SNP 48.
might just go to bed tbh

exciting ain't it
@tash_wynarczyk <ROSE>
hopefully last night's kip under tory rule

let's get it tf in

Lib Dem 9% (NC)
UKIP 12% (-2)
Green 4% (NC)
Others 6% (NC)
let's goooo
@MSmithsonPB @OwenJones84 exact experience of anyone with lefty mates conned by clegg in 2010 - they'll never vote ld again
@KTD89 what's new
@edgardavidsgeps the bits with them other characters are fucking atrocious
@damnson not to one i replied to, but should do for the first one with the c bomb <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@damnson aww chin up man you're a lovely man x
@mark_wardle nowhere near as funny as the guy that bothered to tell everyone about it thinks it is tho

@MsiDouglas big issues? immigration i guess? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sehol 
@KTD89 can't be proved though can it, judge him by what he said and does, not what you assume or deduce
@MsiDouglas what's the split? liberal to avoid tory?
@KTD89 here we go
latest brand video absolutely slaying the sun is immense
@youngin_uk ha, seriously going to lose significant amount of votes if not seats
would take a decent lab victory now over any cup win for nufc in my lifetime have that eh lads
@tash_wynarczyk yah legitimacy is a key thing if cameron works himself if it's really close, all the green-wavering votes would make a diff.
@tash_wynarczyk i was same position a month ago but ed has led a positive optimistic and hopeful campaign.. tbh you're prob not in marginal?
@tash_wynarczyk howez pet 
@ScottWalker1984 aye give him 5 years and it'll be explicit
prospect of boris johnson's character getting absolutely bodied in commons every week is too delicious
cameron didn't appear to give af until two weeks ago when he clearly had a rocket put up him major donors
then you have osborne may ids and hunt being removed - this is actually sweeter than cameron going
think they've seriously underestimated people's feeling of betrayal i know two people who will categorically never vote lib again after 2010
the 'liberals' being decimated is up there
finding it very difficult to rank the possible positive outcomes of election in terms of greatness
@paulgibbins @AdamClery ha, make me solid 5'9 <RELIEVED FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
@AdamClery 
one of the kids has dropped a sd hoarding into a visualisation they're getting failed
@AdamClery yah? 
@AdamClery home with wine man only way
@gillesoffthenet wash your mouth out she's epic
@RockcliffeFiles get in!
there's nothing nuanced about it it's a simple choice between two men and what they stand for
may be the tightest election but it's surely the most basic
such a simple choice
who will fight harder for those that can't fight for themselves?
sums them both up there, brilliant comparison
@lightacandleOTM @AdamClery great comparison <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@MsiDouglas @TheSunNewspaper quite the opposite - even morons have been made skeptical of this imo

@Denster85 ha i'm looking forward to that
@Denster85 they've highlighted what torys have done, intend to do, and said 'you should be scared' cause next 5hrs will be even worse.
@Denster85 ..been one of fear, scaremongering, and playing on people's fears. No vision, no hope, no aspiration to anything better.
@Denster85 certain tory principles, policies, and results are so horrendous imo it's a morally reprehensible - their whole campaign has..

humphries on today so sticking archers omnibus on instead
@billfromthetoon @ToonArmyJayne i cancelled my ST over a week ago, ill go back when there's a club deserving of support there

@toonarmyblog @ToonArmyJayne ish
pack your bags you awful shiny tosser @David_Cameron 
@rammlet he couldn't look more like him man it's hilarious
@jamescolwill @swrain79 @MilburnCasual @MsiDouglas thought of his tightness blowing up in his face with two successive relegation is great
@rammlet champagne for lunch who do you think you are p diddy?
@rammlet hehe he's unreal this crute bloke 
the only thing fatty wants is pl status

he doesn't give af about protests

'postponing' protest til 'safe' is absolutely ludicrous
'support the team to get us safe then protest at ashley'

are these people actually retarded
some truly baffling opinions being rt by @MsiDouglas
@Conway_Sean jesus mate, in need of a serious refuelling
@reds32ape @MsiDouglas this is such a weird thing to hope for, you hope fatty gets  the one thing he wants?
@MikeAshleyLies @MsiDouglas ashley cares about one thing only: pl status, as fans we morally have no choice than to hope for relegation
@davecowell1585 @MsiDouglas what a truly bizarre viewpoint to have
@swrain79 @MsiDouglas have you been on another planet for a few years?
@MilburnCasual @swrain79 @jamescolwill @MsiDouglas why? fans have stopped giving af. why do you want to stay up? another season of this? no.
@AustraliaToon1 @MsiDouglas @MikeAshleyLies no
labour has brand delia coogan freeman izzard you know sound people

@AdamClery noticeable change in tone but believe he'd do anything to keep torys out <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>


so whinge all you like about him and what he's said this year how many people have you got labour's message to
brand just told 10,000,000 people the torys have absolutely no route to to vote for labour

@KTD89 @rammlet @pharmy1917 fatty surely gets zero enjoyment, why tf does he bother - not even much profit for him in context of his wealth
@KTD89 contrast with fatty spending nowt - who's enjoyed it more

@edgardavidsgeps not down the toilet plz
@edgardavidsgeps heartbreaking
@DFletcherSport @RobbieSavage8 janmaats was more blatant and carver not playing it up because he knows DJ will call him out for being shit
interested to hear savage's deliberately obtuse viewpoint
@gibbyobertan maybe if he'd maybe apologised himself, he can get tf blaming just them tho
@AdamClery @paulgibbins maaaates

@hdawg187 magnificent viewing ain't it
on a scale of 1 to 10 how useless are you

probably minus-10

see?
5 mins of bullshit, bluster, and cowardice. FOH 
idiot actually thinks -10 is above 10, god help us <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
@_MikeEdwards @gillesoffthenet been feeling ill since i got up but this is all making my day
GET IN @gillesoffthenet
@iainmacintosh @gillesoffthenet presumably not himself? worst manager in history of pl and a disgrace to the city and NE. bottling coward.
@RockcliffeFiles @adamf2384 in a world of logic, yes. this is mike-ashley's newcastle united though. prob get a payrise
because janmaat is actually pretty media savvy and (hopefully) will have no bother throwing carver under the bus
wonder why that is?
despite his machismo bluster carver the coward bottles critcising janmaat for a worse version of what mike did
@MsiDouglas the man's a fucking idiot - the janmaat one was even worse, but he knows janmaat will have no bother answering him back in press
ha carver saying willo did it on purpose but not having the bollocks to say janmaat did
only one getting any respect is janmaat who called this shite club out from pretty much week after he joined - good luck on his summer move
bet carver bottles the post-match
no one could do better tho remember
tomorrow "not soon enough" to get shot of carver pundits saying
worst newcastle manager and team ive seen in my life (31)
ideas on the lineup for next week? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>
cutting to the away fans, why on gods name are you still stood there
@paulgibbins @AdamClery haha lunatic
mills absolutely calling that right janmaat did it on purpose
haha janmaat <LARGE RED CIRCLE>
(obv not)
is he doing this on purpose?
carverkazi?
@paulgibbins @AdamClery prob wise worh your formsheet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
as bad as pardew was he will have seen this coming tbh, useless but not an idiot
@AdamClery @paulgibbins haha calling his bluff
@FloEastoe hahah proper italian stunting
danny mills top5 pundit no @s
@paulgibbins ouch


@ponsaeIius off now, but he did
@RockcliffeFiles saying the same, have some respect for himself the club and the city, this is a disgrace
cambiasso an absolute inspiration
@LeShandy you beauty
who was the guy that put the 5 on relegation at 300/1?
obv deliberate to avoid playing at sjp
ha scenes
@billyjoelismint yup
might be 6 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
carver and stone have absolutely no clue at all what to do not a damn clue
support the team FOH
they can stand their looking sour in the away end but why tf would you even think of going to this match
@dwright75 get in the bin you fucking idiot
lol
@hdawg187 yah but i couldn't care less about that tbh, more relegations the better
blackpool match suspended
that's how you protest - not whingeing outside sports direct in the drizzle

danny mills advocating a double sub even before half time haha
@MsiDouglas talk to em

robbie earle just went in on sissoko on my nbc stream - great to hear
@NickMiller79 @IBWMJeff anyone shout "lizzzzard"?
up there with john stitton.. "Kevin Borseth Rant" 
@MsiDouglas sick of this macho bullshit from him in place of actually constructive or reflective thought
while the sun cries about it to its 2m customers, plenty of which are bars and cafes who's customers hate it

good start to the weekend
i use same wrapping paper as victoria beckham <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><OK HAND SIGN> 
@ryandavison11 @MsiDouglas i think he's invented his own parallel universe with different mathematics
@MsiDouglas his work is just selling tat to idiots though, depressing he could do literally anything and he chooses to just do more of that!

if you have that much money you should take one of two paths

1) elon musk
2) dan bilzerian

some something useful to humanity or enjoy it
let alone ones that buy football clubs they have no interest in and get nowt out of
tbh billionaires that still work are absolutely bonkers
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius ..on with a middling football club that i appear to get literally nothing out of. It's baffling.
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius ..a billionaire in history. I'd sack the whole lot of and go live like dan bilzerian for 50 years not be mucking..
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius ..then what possible reason is there to labour himself with the hassle? he is by far the biggest waste of a..
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius really?! that only makes me less able to understand why he bothers.. if it isn't profit, enjoyment, advertising..
@kerouac151 @MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius yah that's what i was imagining with the rt anyway
best day of nicholas witchell's life today

the parasite's parasite
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius think ya man meant 'cost' as in future loss as apposed to actually losing money
@Denster85 @rebeccarrrr hahah bet that was fun
@MsiDouglas @ponsaeIius if we assume all nufc is advertising vehicle for sd, then it costs him a lot of free advertising/revenue
@Denster85 @rebeccarrrr he very much can, and apparently even if mcclaren gets his he told he'll "still be there" - like a mad ex-husband
@RockcliffeFiles @rebeccarrrr think he's got it between stations and just singing along to the white noise
@Denster85 @rebeccarrrr every interview getting more erratic and nonsensical - and that's after the press lads have tidied it up!

#creepingsharia 
no1 reason ppl on britain talent and apprentice and all that guff give for deserving something: i really want it
that chancers like carver are anywhere near the management of the club is just one of many reasons i binned my st
why should we choose you

because i really want this 

so what
carver seems to buy into this absolute bs that because you want you something you deserve it
@gillesoffthenet he's the wife-beating one
@chirpydrums70 for next season? aye did same but didn't bother ringing club
so did carver call that kid fan a fucking cunt or not?
riding home in the sun 5 days off let's go

@MsiDouglas yup, he is there for the money, and there's less money the lower we go, so bring on league 2

@JackStanley86 @MikeAshleyLies @Geordinho @tfeditor1892 ok, see what nationwide come back with, if not ill try small claims
@chirpydrums70 interesting, just you use any legal/banking mechanism or just deal with club? they won't make it easy for you..

@MikeAshleyLies @NUFC @nufctrust first email reply from DD/bacs services 
@MikeAshleyLies @chriskelly1985 I got it too but without ref to specific clause and spelt wrong, "none refundable" 
@tfeditor1892 @JackStanley86 @MikeAshleyLies @NUFC has anyone successfully managed this season?
@JackStanley86 @tfeditor1892 @MikeAshleyLies @NUFC what told and what's reality are diff things, they won't give it back easily
@MikeAshleyLies @NUFC @nufctrust noone had luck with it so far? be useful to have a guide for others cancelling
@MikeAshleyLies @NUFC for me it seems simple - payment for goods/services not yet received issue
@MikeAshleyLies @NUFC relevant clauses, just whether they stand up 
@MikeAshleyLies @NUFC I've contacted citizens advice, dd service, ombudsman so far, will keep posted
@ToonArmyMIA @TheMightySteve @mannion99 @financialombuds aye sent them and citizens advice too! More the merrier!
@ToonArmyMIA @TheMightySteve @mannion99 cool, exactly the place i used earlier <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@ToonArmyMIA @TheMightySteve @mannion99 my thoughts too m8
get him and his massive foot and stupid mouth back visible

@ToonArmyMIA @TheMightySteve @mannion99 surely it's a simple paid for services not received issue? seems mad
@NUFCFansUtd have people have got refunds for next season's payments from DD already taken by club after cancelling?
@AshleyOutdotcom have people have got refunds for next season's payments from DD already taken by club after cancelling?
@TheMightySteve @mannion99 let's not have that <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
ill then clearly write up how to do it
you saw how i got my 1100 back off scottish power but 130 compensation, this will be easy
direct debit people, ombudsman, and citizens advice contacted re payment for next season's ticket already taken as refund possibility
@TheMightySteve @mannion99 aye it was i think, sent to citizens advice bureau
@TheMightySteve @mannion99 When did we start paying for 2015/16?
@TheMightySteve @mannion99 i've sent it to financial ombudsman service too
@MikeAshleyLies heard chat people have got refunds for next season's payments from DD already taken by club after cancelling?
hearing chat people have got refunds for next season's payments from DD already taken by club? howso?
@mannion99 @TheMightySteve cheers btw
@mannion99 @TheMightySteve I've emailed the direct debit service desk with the situation and extracts from the terms, let's see..
@TheMightySteve see clause 14.6/7 tho
@TheMightySteve think this is the key one, not sure about it 
@TheMightySteve this bit about no refunds if it's the club that cancels it 
@TheMightySteve handy it being online cause you can keyword search: 
@TheMightySteve 5.3 to me is written in past tense, not future - no other mentions of non-refundable in terms 
@TheMightySteve interesting - shy bairn gets nowt
@paulgibbins ex-prime minister david cameron
@TheMightySteve might have to dig it out, how can they possibly do it? it's payment for goods/services not yet received?
@TheMightySteve exactly what i thought, reckon can get it back on a technicality?

@paulgibbins @miss_archer i love a sentence with commas semicolons and hyphens all spitting it up tho it's only one here i lose grammar
@paulgibbins @miss_archer i have no idea if this exists?! what does it do? add in loads of exposition in rural spanish skirkishes?
@paulgibbins @miss_archer yah time is money tho so FOH has to suffice sometimes
@miss_archer FUCKOUTTAHERE
tbh brand should be a more respected interviewer than gimps like burley and phillip scofield
why tf is he berating miliband for meeting brand christ
humphries is a bad tory hell cant wait til he's off the today program
@antonydaly loooool
questions that should be asked:

- you are massively out of your depth
- local doesn't mean good
- stop the macho posturing 
- quit

@antonydaly hahahah ghostsleeves
absolutely bonkers
lots of pr terms about message and narrative and positivity and perception and how the club is so grateful
personal apology for swearing and abusing them of course, "off the record" wendy taylor interjects
@sehol dunno but that'll maybe be the line
think the kids are a little over-awed by this tbh and missing their just being used
what possible benefit is there in watching the training
@dcb72 their headlines are a total embarrassment
@RockcliffeFiles apparently turned up to u17s few weeks ago offering them out for fights and talking in third person - he's cracked
@Chateau_Nouveau amazing ain't it - the man has know shame, he more than anyone knows he doesn't have a clue what he's doing
must be nice having a day off to trot along to the training ground for a pr puff piece choreographed by ashley's generals
never forget 
big photo of him meeting the fans and explaining what he's trying to do as they smile with thumbs up FOH
"trust in john" the headline tomorrow
wonder if we'll see another volte-face on the tone of the local press i expect so

plus as clever as brand is there's no way he'll make ed look daft in that

@mark_wardle surely intentional, it's phenomenal, what a guy!
@mark_wardle .."they'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair.."
@mark_wardle "..you have to show them that you're really not scared, you're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare.."
@mark_wardle aye something uplifting and transcendental, in chaos: look lads man; mj, chill, dancing, optimism, let's go
prob helped by the fact that beat it is a top 5 song of all time and don't even @ me
can't stop watching that beat it guy dancing in baltimore, something very powerful about it
@mark_wardle to me it's more he's doing it for everyone else not himself, it's a remarkable piece of film in context of the other reports
@MsiDouglas @SportsDirectUK ha here we go
&gt;&gt;. "..A Labour spokesman said Miliband went to film an interview, adding that the party was looking forward to it being broadcast."
"..raising speculation that the comedian could be considering endorsing him."
shit just got real. "Ed Miliband spotted leaving Russell Brand's London home"

"Ed Miliband has told PinkNews that Labour is in favour of the legal recognision of humanist weddings."
@paulgibbins @afneil esp as a tory lad, he must hate cameron
@paulgibbins @AdamClery absolutely hilarious
meanwhile tory councillor candidate suspended for saying couldn't support miliband as he was a jew
@MsiDouglas absolutely all over the place both
jesus that last rt
and asks him what he wanted to do when he was 7 looool
literal child - a 7yo - asking ed if he thinks cameron is "a chicken"

@NUFCThreatLevel @adamf2384 plus spin the logic around and having a billionaire owner brings success: arsenal, chelsea, city, manu
@NUFCThreatLevel @adamf2384 squad makeup was totally different last time though, we go down this season, and we stay down
of thats any indication of next pmqs then bring on boris as leader what an absolutely clueless hoop
boris flailing like complete idiot when put next to a relaxed and confident miliband
miliband bodying boris johnson pretty nicely too

@IBWMJeff talk to em
@ponsaeIius ha thought you bottled it
@ponsaeIius 
100% vindication in avoiding this bollocks
@rammlet @KTD89 wow, im done at the end of this season, ive seen enough, hope we both get back one day <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@TaylorandBesty the only way we win is everyone doing what me and you are doing.. staying away and talking on twitter <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@TaylorandBesty it was risky to change strategy, and today my skepticism seems vindicated, but i take no pleasure in it
@TaylorandBesty yah and it worked a treat for Spurs, then the message was 'stand outside sd, go in, then sing, then leave..' it's too much
@rammlet @KTD89 far too many ppl criticise, I wasn't there spurs and not there now, complete boycott by maj only thing that will work
@rammlet @KTD89 dgmw i'm not ridiculing i'm just saying why spoil a winning formula by diluting it with a sd protest?
@rammlet @KTD89 ha aye
@rammlet @KTD89 it was simple, hammer home the same points as last week, local press more of this.. &amp; boycott again 
that knob's distribution has been woeful for 4 seasons
lool
@TaylorandBesty ..not the number of fronts to take him on on because that lessens the impact.. the simpler the better imo
@TaylorandBesty I'm not sure tho, i think that strategy alienates people, the main thrust of any protest needs to be unification of fans..
@ryandavison11 would have been so much easier, instead they've dragged sd into in and tried to make it a more "visible" protest with walkout
@TaylorandBesty @ConnorJ09 same here too
@TaylorandBesty twitter messing up order of my replies <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@TaylorandBesty not dragged sd into it, not fragmented supported in doing so, not advocated going in, not looked daft waving flyers..
lol
@TaylorandBesty ..there is one way and one way only to get rid of this tosser and it is everyone sacking it off and cancelling dd
@ConnorJ09 @TaylorandBesty exactly that
@ryandavison11 bang on
shouts to the ashley out lot for completely wasting all the momentum built last week

@TheDimpleboy @ChidzHazenberry it's a load of dead black caricatures sinking to the seabed with "family reunion" as the title - hilarious

When they ridicule the hundreds of black immigrants who recently drowned? 
@tash_wynarczyk yah it's so bad it's not even funny, it's like he got his terminally ill mate to do it or something <PENSIVE FACE>
@tash_wynarczyk depressing is exactly the word
wow 
@Denster85 you won't/shouldn't get heating allowance

the organisers of all this are totally missing the opportunity to build on last week by deviating from it
so going and making a scene outside there is way counter productive because it's the man that's the problem not his shops
besides that's it's just some tosser's tawdry shop
idgaf about sports direct as long as the next gov abolishes zero hours contracts
sd one is stupid you need to pick your battles specifically around one cause not spread them all over

@burdis80 same boat m8
@burdis80 would be odd not making a 'last game' of it, but then again what do i owe them
@IBWMJeff here's hoping, you're an NUFC  fan tho right? just not st/available ?
bad bells on both sides but being outside today felt strangely righteous
weirder decision to attend a pre-game protest boycott then appear to sneak back into it ground at 4pm
weird decision by some boycotters to sing "your support is fucking shit" at our own fans today tbf
@adamf2384 ill do the graph when i get in
@burdis80 really? was actually canceled? wow. doubt ill be back but good to know <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

@kovakick @Danny_McMoomins @edgardavidsgeps <NEUTRAL FACE>
@Lucy_Wheeler @s1charlton haha he wasn't, very little attendance all round! I think the penguins were a much better option.
@MsiDouglas great shot
here come and get your dad like he's at the front of the protest and has had enough enough to drink lad
@KTD89 good dig
@ponsaeIius yup
btw there is absolutely zero audible noise in the city

@tt9m: im off running in my nike kit must remember to never complain about workers rights again l8rs
@adamf2384 i don't know what the expression means but i think you're saying my comparisons don't make sense, fair enough
ultimately do what you like for your own reasons but don't kid yourself of your moral superiority
this platform has given rise to a type of person that thinks useful argument can be made or won or lost in 3 sentences
if your stretch your logic beyond your 140 characters it collapses
amazon? never used it cause then i couldn't complain about tax havens
and presumably don't drink eh funding multinational alcohol companies that products ruin lives as they avoid tax
whinge about a dd but propagate the  fixed-odds ubiquity through your accumulators
presuming these people don't gamble too
ive even got a mortgage presumably i couldn't complain about austerity
ive got health insurance am i somehow complicit in bankers bonuses
don't judge me by what i do judge me by what direct debits i have FOH
we live in an aquarium of hypocrisy we can't help be part of it FOH
buying 'ethical' food yet wearing any sort of cotton
wanting female vote yet being de facto part of patriarchy by being male
like protesting about a war yet still paying tax
scanning about the tag which i haven't done in years there's a lot of chat about having a live dd 'invalidating' a protest
@TheMightySteve follow the link of tweets fam what i think isn't always clear if you reply in the middle <SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
maybe ill decide based on which side of here comes across as the least self-righteous
so following the logic of you go to the game you lose your right to complain about the club
but not voting is the WORST THING  and you 'lose your right to complain' about politics
but is that voting in election or boycotting the game
im not doing it cause it makes no difference and it won't outcome affect the outcome
@RockcliffeFiles ha ha get lost
who's the most morally superior set of fans stay tuned all day for our rolling coverage
let the great nufc pious-off begin!
@RockcliffeFiles leaving it up to when get there to decide what i'm doing
@IBWMJeff that's very true actually
@AdamClery keep the faith <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@IBWMJeff whoever is coordinating the campaign has done great so far, so i'll just have to trust them i suppose
@AdamClery mate have you seen the trailer chris pratt is the raptors friend and he rides his bike with them: it's a 10/10
@IBWMJeff yah but his recent success has been pulling people like me back with lefty speak, just hope he doesn't undo it all

@damnson @Hayrr that's hardly comparable to hopkins

@Hayrr @damnson mainstream uk opinion? mainstream like most? or majority? or pervading? of uk? all 60m? not that different? come on
@KTHopkins it's gon be class when the catastrophic breakdown you're due happens fyi
@damnson never heard anyone say anything with such little empathy as this type of muck
