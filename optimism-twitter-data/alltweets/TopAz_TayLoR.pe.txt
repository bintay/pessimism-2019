You don't know freedom untill atleast juust One leg, is completely free from any clothing when taking a shit
I Need to watch Selma tho
Why does buying lean feel so akward and weird to me but buying weed is a norm
I tried it a couple more times after that day and I never ever regreted it... If anything, I miss that feeling
The rest of that day is untold, but was the best day ever!!! I fell inlove with Molly
Off in that room... Ma niggaz were still there eating and watching me on some o_O.... The girls came up stairs to get me since they were
Running out with the other girls lafin, on some I'm trippin... Then I had this urge of listening to music, volume on LOUD!! I danced my ass
LOl my niggaz thot I was crazy, I thought they were boring at that moment so I ran to the balcony to let it all out and shout!  Snazz came
Felt before in my life... Ran to the other room wher the gents wher, told them to get up, why they so boring... I was talking so fast!
A young 5min of woozyness, tho it felt looong... Then All of a Sudden... BANG!!!! I was up from bed feeling some sorta energy I've never
I couldn't even shout... Thot I'd sleep it out. This whole time I totally forgot that I took a pill maybe that's why I'm feeling this way..
Well, plz save me some food for when I wake up" lol thinkin I'm gonna nap or some shit like dat.. The bed was spinning, I was feeling woozy
This weird feeling (light headed)... Thot it was nuthin..  tried taking another bite, it wouldn't go in.. I was like "gents I'm not feeling
Are just fucking with me... So we begin to eat... 1st slice of bread, down! AND THEN... Half way thru my 2nd slice of bread I start gettin
I just replied "yeah, yeah" just so I could get to my food.. We get to the flat and I'm like ag this pill aint working on me, these chicks
On our way back up, on the stairs.. Snazz and the other girls pop up and ask me "are you tipping yet!!?" All excited and shit..
To get some food... I had actually forgotten that I had taken the pill (half of it)... So we in the shop ordering.. Another 10min goes by
I was on some "mxm, these girls are playing.. If they can handle the trip, so can I.." 10 minutes went by and we decided to go downstairs
*mouth... While all along my niggaz are just sitting there like WTF is goin on here.. Snazz and the ex leave and tell me not to freak out
Bad enough, she (ex) had the pill in her hand and decided too feed it to me, so I did as she asked, closed my eyes and opened my moth lol..
A knock on the door... I rushed to open, and she was there... with my ex... And we weren't really on good terms -_- as if that wasn't
"Ayt I'm coming up in a few".. At that point my niggaz ddnt know wat was goin on since they were in the crib
She'd always been tellin me bout how dat shit is big in durban... So I was like hell yeah! .. She laughed a lil, then replied
Now? "@Nash_Taylor_: @Zeus_Taylor @TopAz_TayLoR Mdu please handle, pass by church and pick up something"
So I went to the balcony to smoke a ciggie, when Snazz popped from the bottom corner on ground level and shouted "We B! Uyawufuna u Xo/Co?"
Me, sphephelo and @culpritM_taylor woke up feeling all hung over and shit...  but the girls from 21 were all roudy like they never slept
It all happend in Auckland Park, Anatu Place flat no 250... It was a saterday morning after a night of boozing
Haha I remeber the first time I popped molly...
