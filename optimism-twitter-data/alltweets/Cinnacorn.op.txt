@botsy_ are we ever going to find out what will happen with the sinister curry man and his bid for prime ministry
so I am now the proud (?) owner of this game because it was in the club nintendo 18-card game case

ron fucking perlman voices mr. lancer in danny phantom how did I not know this
also got a perfect skirt and a top for my sailor moon cosplay (although they don't match so I need another top and skirt) :D
@botsy_ alright, just keep 'em in mind lol
yooo I just got a club nintendo 18-card game case at a thrift store!!! (with a Cars game apparently)
@goldfishwarning thank you for the response
still no response about godspell guys
there's a shirt that says "fresh princess" in the fresh prince font and it's rad but I'm also a white girl
should we get @goldfishwarning a dvd of godspell
@KayEffKay he's a cutie, take lots of pics of both of them :D
@KayEffKay who is meghan's friend?
@botsy_ drink some water
(but srsly tho, look into chamomile tea or cherry juice if this is a regular problem)
tonight is gonna be another night I try to whistle for so long that I feel lightheaded and I blame hilary duff
someday I'm gonna accidentally whistle and I'll be so surprised I'll forget how I did it
@botsy_ YES AND IT DIDN'T HELP
@botsy_ also this song makes me mad again that I can't whistle gdi
I should like, get a body modification to hang my sewing scissors off of because I KEEP FUCKING MISPLACING THEM
@botsy_ also if hilary releases a new album soon I'm totally fuckin' gonna buy it man, dignity sucked but these new tracks are promising
@botsy_ honestly I would not be surprised if that's how it works, like they have an approved playlist or something lol
@botsy_ right? like I'm almost certain I may have already heard it, I was at a mall last week
@botsy_ hilary duff is actually a fairy tale witch, promises of any of these things are usually a legitimate offer
@botsy_ 
it's catchy but also sounds exactly like every song I hear on the radio in forever 21
a new hilary duff song came out last month and I didn't notice
I'm so ashamed
that said, seems vocaloid as a program has come a long way since I stopped paying attention, still robotic but syllables blend way smoother
and new ones are like "HER FAVOURITE FOOD IS THIS AND SHE HAS A BROTHER AND TWO SISTERS AND HER DAD IS PRESIDENT OF A COMPANY"
my favourite thing is reading the profiles for vocaloid characters
older ones are like "17 years old, designed to resemble this or that"
the conservatives apparently have a skewed (and bigoted) perception of free speech
hope they're cool with never getting my vote ever
apparently the harper govt is cool supporting charlie hebdo but wants to charge organizations supporting boycotts of israel with hate crimes
@KayEffKay she's very graceful too I can see
@Cinnacorn like here he is amongst my bags and misc soft things 
@KayEffKay your dog is so pretty man
@KayEffKay here is diego being a sleepy circle of dog on my bed 
I have this shelf unit in my room that was once a dresser, but turned into two deep and tall shelves for bags
griffin's decided it's a nest
my friend who works at my optometrist's just informed me that a device she used on my eye today ACTUALLY POKED MY EYE oh god
I'm not afraid to use simple english wikipedia when normal wikipedia isn't getting to the point
@melodyadira lol yep! I mean pennies are still legal tender, but when paying in cash it's rounded to the nearest 5 anyway.
@melodyadira there was definitely some backlash but it's been a few years now so we're pretty used to it! it was for a good reason so
also I had my nosepieces tightened and now it's like "why aren't my glasses sliding down my nose"
anime con friend of mine works at my optometrist's &amp; it's like
"I've seen you in full dwarven beard &amp; now you're pointing stuff at my eye"
@melodyadira lol yeah, government was all "it costs more to make these than they're worth" so paying w/ cash gets rounded to the nearest 5c
@GoldfishWarning I end up with a lot of nickles because of timmies prices but then I use them on vending machines
@GoldfishWarning huh
can't decide if I miss them or not, I liked having something to throw in fountains and stuff
does america still have pennies? we don't up here anymore
more importantly, while cleaning my desk I found more hair clips and $1.06 in dimes, nickles, quarters, and a penny
"hey look it's my microSD to SD card converters!
...I still don't have an SD slot on either of my computers!!!"
@GoldfishWarning man I don't even eat it cuz it's healthy (if there is plenty of dressing, it isn't anyway), I eat it cuz it's damn good
there are so many packs of pokemon cards in my room jfc
idk I'm really glad I unlearned a lot of that stuff, I used to really hate on """plastic""" girls and it's like
that was a waste of my time
just found one of the many childhood journals I only wrote one or two entries in
it's from grade 7 &amp; it's dripping w/ internalized misogyny
my favourite is when diego expels particularly loud barks from his tiny body, his front legs jump a bit with every bark
@GoldfishWarning yeaaah I mean microwave cakes usually have other things to mask it but eggs get p rubbery in the microwave
made a microwave mug french toast recipe for breakfast
it was extremely lackluster lol
@Vidya_James I always forget about that mask lol, that's why I mentioned it
@Vidya_James remember to get the all-night mask the same cycle as the blast mask, he only sells it if he doesn't have the bomb bag to sell
@Vidya_James still tho I think getting the blast mask interferes with some of the anju/kafei stuff if I recall correctly
@Vidya_James yeah haha I was like "n...no? that's for the chateau romani?"
and it's a closet too so I can replace the one I'm less fond of in my space princess bedroom :O
one thing I hope will get me into animal crossing again is the gemini item for the zodiac set DLC will be here in less than two weeks!
@Vidya_James wait why can't you, I thought anju/kafei was separate from the ranch stuff
today it's stormy and I have an optometrist's appointment
the power better not go out while she's doing anything right next to my eye
whenever I find novelty ways to make food I always have to remind myself "ELEANOR YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS PROPERLY"
@smileysmile31 hmm, alright
idk it's just always been a source of dissuasion for me, starbucks why ya gotta be like that
@botsy_ I ALREADY AM
@smileysmile31 @botsy_ YEAH BUT I HEAR SO MANY TALES AND I AM A DELICATE FLOWER
@botsy_ like I said, I know why they confirm, it's to get the order right but
still, I'm scared they'll be condescending about it XD
@botsy_ starbucks is just like, I have heard you have tasty specialty beverages but your methods of operation make me a bit uncomfortable
@botsy_ it'd sure make me more interested in going there
also
idk I don't like the names thing
just call out what I ordered like most places
@botsy_ yeah but like
I don't want them being all "YOU MEAN BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON" or whatever at me condescendingly
@botsy_ I know they ask you so that they get the right order but like
those names mean nothing to me??? I mean the size that is your medium!
I really wish starbucks would use normal size names
part of the reason I don't ever get anything there is bc I'm too nervous I'll look dumb
@GoldfishWarning GOOD THING I DO!!!
@GoldfishWarning and then I think it was one you did by yourself but sent to me and you were making a news report about the sims 2 for me
@GoldfishWarning itunes is on shuffle and I just listed to one where you start out with a really bad australian accent for some reason
they were hilarious at the time but now the most hilarious part is how weird they are and how young we sound lmao
.@GoldfishWarning and I used to make audio recordings that were fake news reports and some of them are so ridiculous
OH GOD

@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus ah okay
it's apparently also a noun declension of the swedish word for wet snow that easily forms snowballs
@Dalkalopagus @botsy_ what is that
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus stay hydrated guys
cuz if life is mostly water, then not having water is not having life
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus comes in mayonnaise variant too
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus I have no problem with either of these bc I fucking love watermelon and I fucking love s'mores but
ele ele watermele
@Dalkalopagus @botsy_ name a flavour after me when you get famous
don't name it elizabeth though
@Dalkalopagus @botsy_ your names are both like the ice cream guys
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus yeah I was about to say, that's the wrong kind of ellie
@Dalkalopagus @smileysmile31 idk which one of us you're talking to but if it's directed at me I'm very unfamiliar with that lmao
@smileysmile31 if you're talking about @Dalkalopagus I just assumed every day was that day
@GoldfishWarning it probably can't be worse than ketchup and ice cream
griffin's nestled deep into my closet to chew on his ball like a tiny squeaking elderly cave troll
@GoldfishWarning it doesn't sound very appealing tbh
@GoldfishWarning huh. it sounds like medicine
@smileysmile31 ok
what the hell even is ovaltine
@KayEffKay it reminds me of crawfish
my poor mother, her birthday is just ten days after christmas and mother's day is within a week of my sister's birthday
did a lot of laundry this weekend so PJs, bedsheets, and towel are all freshly washed
legs are freshly shaved
used a fancy bath melt
yesssss
@KayEffKay @GoldfishWarning okay I just realised this too
whenever I leave the house with my dad, I tell whichever dog's closest that he's the man of the house now and has to look after mom for us
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ ditto
unless it's the verb in which case it's en-velup
it's disappointing when I actually try foods I've avoided since childhood and end up disliking them anyway
like now I KNOW I don't like them
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning I wish she at least had bleached tips
@GoldfishWarning idk about the sunglasses but

@GoldfishWarning would not mind living next door to guy fieri, his mom, or my mom so really, no matter how you twist it it's fine
today I learned that guy fieri's mom lives next door to him
ngl tho that doesn't sound like a bad arrangement
my grandparents are p open-minded for old people but the amount they loathe tattoos is almost comical
too bad me &amp; my sister both want some
@GoldfishWarning god I hope so
@GoldfishWarning  !!!!!!!!!!

@codingcranium this sounds like my dreams come true omg
"that's me. making-things-worse eleanor."
you guys look at what my sister and my dogs and I did today

weird food combinations I've adored since childhood: croissants dipped in apple sauce
it's really good I promise!
@GoldfishWarning oh okay, I learned a thing!
@GoldfishWarning is your refrigerator running, killing you guy
@GoldfishWarning yeah but if it also makes things cold like mine, the issue probably isn't the quality of the fridge
@GoldfishWarning we put them in the fridge and they don't stick to each other most of the time, idk what's different
just tried a sample of an 85$ face moisturizer
it smells like orange freezies and cough syrup
this better make my skin look fantastic
@Vidya_James alas, I cannot join this time, tell me how it goes!
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning no come back to hometown
if I were a dragon I would probably either hoard rubber ducks or fancy bath products, based on my current collections
sister is 23!!! one more month til I am 21
20 min left of my sister being 22
meaning 20 min &amp; one month left of me being 20 b/c our mom managed to have us on the same day of the month
I can't not sing "untrimmed chest" in hey soul sister in a deep growling voice
don't give me a recorder or I will intentionally make those dying bird noises I mentioned earlier
but when played right they can sound like magical forest instruments
I feel like people shit on recorders too much
like sure they're usable by little kids and they can sound like dying birds when played wrong
GUYS I STILL REMEMBER MY RECORDER SCALE
my sister warms up her voice with proper scales
I warm up my voice by screaming like a constipated cave troll
"I mean, uteruses are like 3D printers for people" - me talking to my mom
what if there was a typo in the script for lord of the rings
"THE BEAGLES ARE COMING!!!"
mind you, advantages of having to go outside with griffin so he doesn't eat dirt: not much aside from griffin not eating dirt
disadvantages of having to go outside with griffin so he doesn't eat dirt: 
bugs IN MY SHIRT CAN YOU PLEASE NOT
@GoldfishWarning he's also the white boy who thinks using the n word is cool, for those keeping track at home!
I think my last two years of HS at least were awesome, but there are still ppl from HS that I want to distance myself from as much as I can
apparently a guy I was friends with in high school is now a white boy who uses the n word ugh
also I need to pick up more sushi rice for onigiri
making onigiri makes me feel like a huge weeb but it's so tasty
I need to see if any of the local asian supermarkets have barbecue eel
I want to make udon with it, that shit's delicious
@botsy_ thanks you too
the tip of my left-hand thumb just started burning???!??
I really want christopher lee to follow me around narrating my life like it's a high fantasy novel
I would make food for him in exchange
my favourite thing about going back to runescape a couple times a year is freaking people out with my ancient holiday items
"what if there was like prostitution except you cooked for the person"
hired cooks, eleanor. you're thinking of those.
somebody please buy me a super nice computer so that I can run super nice games (and the money to buy the super nice games too please)
@botsy_ this is one thing I would definitely not ask anyone to promise or to hold that promise
@botsy_ please do
I went in knowing what people had said about it and it was worse than that
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning idk a lot of chicken noodle soups I've had have had like, bits of celery in them
and veggie broth is a thing
@botsy_ usually I'd say "please don't" but I think you should and report back
@GoldfishWarning I'm sure you could find a vegetarian recipe? like one that includes the same ingredients except chicken &amp; with veggie broth
@botsy_ space jam definitely had a more coherent plot and more entertainment value
@botsy_ except jerry seinfeld failed at keeping the bee secret (beecret?) and toy story was actually good
@botsy_ it was like the ants in a bug's life except with humans and also bad
@botsy_ in bee movie they basically all could talk and emote and shit but there was like some bee society vow to keep it secret from humans
@botsy_ if this is like bee movie they would be capable of that too
@botsy_ idk I feel like we could come to an understanding like "dude I'm really not comfortable with this"
@botsy_ being able to express myself to insects and know that they understand would be a relief to me
@botsy_ me: "did u leave eggs in my closet"
bee: "naw"
me: "k cool would you mind leaving"
as opposed to
me: "OH GOD WHAT IF THERE'S MORE"
@botsy_ if I was living in bee movie I think I'd be less terrified
tbh I could deal with talking bees because I could tell them to get out
I know it's not cool to make fun of people for typos but typos on beauty product reviews just seem to end up hilarious
"I have very skin"
now that there's been such a huge bee in my room I don't know where I am safe
ohhhh god there was just a very very large bee in my room
my dad rescued and released it
this is why I can never live alone
and that is the tale of what we dubbed The Poo Fields of Lore.
trying to make it green only made it look worse, because the green paint we had wasn't very strong, the brown still showed through
however, we managed to make this majestic beautiful barren field the exact colour of poo.
ours was a Hindu myth, and I seem to recall there was a part about no plants growing. so we made a field that was supposed to just have dirt
each group had to put on a play about a myth they were given. we were given very very large sheets of brown paper to paint as backdrops
back in grade eight, myself, @GoldfishWarning, @MoonMan422, and the other three girls in our class were in a group for a project
just checked my phone and noticed a text @GoldfishWarning sent me like eight hours ago, reminding me of something, so IT'S STORY TIME
me: "griff I don't think you're up for fetch"
me: *rolls the ball a bit too far*
griffin: *falls on his bum going after it*
me: "I TOLD YOU"
diego goes outside with me to play fetch until he's exhausted multiple times a day for the past few days, how does he not get leg cramps
hey guys here is a video of my dogs

my immediate response when anyone tickles me is to dig my nails into their arm but then I feel bad if I do it to anyone but my sister
trying to decide if I want to spend two hours giving myself space toenails today
peanut butter and honey is such a rad combination
@GoldfishWarning well, you know the old saying
when life gives you lemons
make body modifications
@GoldfishWarning ah, yeah, in that case maybe
I'll see if like best buy or something has them before I pay for shipping tho
@GoldfishWarning they last me a decent amount of time and they're p comfy so maybe I'll just get more of them
@GoldfishWarning hmm, might try the panasonic ones
mind you amazon still has people selling JVC marshmallows, the kind I used to have!
@GoldfishWarning inner-ear, I don't like traditional ones :(
I had Sony ones and they lasted about a month
btw I still haven't got new earbuds yet and I'm on my pinchy backups again, what brands do people suggest in the ~30$ price range
maybe I'll see if dad has some chicken wire and wooden posts for it
it'll keep griffin from eating the dirt (???!??) in that area too
summer goals: keep dogs away from the inexplicably large patch of wild strawberry plants in the backyard long enough to get some for myself
I wish my hair was white NOW so I could dye it pastel colours without any extra effort
I hope my hair goes white when I'm old so I can dye it pastel colours
(unfortunately, looking at my fam, I'm probably gonna end up w/ grey)
bugs scare me
(it was probably a bit too big to be head lice, even tho it was p tiny)
small white bug near where I was just lying on the floor more like OH GOD DO I HAVE HEAD LICE AT AGE TWENTY
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning kyg and I have had this discussion before with another friend
she's very anti-juice
I mean from the sounds of it it might actually just be a chocolate milkshake but hey those are good
just learned about tim hortons' new "creamy chocolate chill" drink and I'm still not sure exactly what it is but I want it b/c chocolate
my laptop just crashed for the first time
"Your computer shut down because of a problem."
thank you apple that's v helpful
I didn't win the bonus marks for roman history though, boo
I feel like my wittiness has been challenged, I want to see the winners' captions
all grades are up!
A in US history and A+ in roman history!!!
this means that this semester alone, I just barely held on to my A- average!
@GoldfishWarning @codingcranium oh, yeah, and the what is my IP website is telling me I'm in a different city too XD
@GoldfishWarning @codingcranium yeah haha I hope we switch soon or at least get a better router
still gonna change the tumblies password tho
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning hmm okay
like it's not just the IPs, the places listed are all ~an hour from here but none are actually here
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning not recently, not at the times listed
I'll change my password just in case but it's still bizarre to me
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning and this site confirms they're different too
@codingcranium @GoldfishWarning I know that, but when I go to it it tells me what my actual IP is, which doesn't match what tumblr's saying
diego please learn how to bark at the door you can't just keep jumping at it and hoping for the best
@GoldfishWarning at the same time I doubt hackers specifically from surrounding towns are getting into my account
@GoldfishWarning wow
like, the IP addresses they list aren't the one I see when I check the 192.etc.etc thing so idk but like
I should just get three of those ridiculously gigantic yarn balls and make THE LONGEST BRAID
I wish wig hair didn't tangle so easy because I want to keep braiding the long piece I got for my sailor moon wig
I love braiding hair a lot
"the sun always shines on TV" by a-ha is probably my favourite eighties song
#SeniorYearIn5Words 
why were there two proms
@botsy_ pictures of FRIENDSHIP!!!
@botsy_ good lmao
having them kind of helps when I feel like that tho like
"you wouldn't have this icon without FRIENDSHIP!!!"
@botsy_ ngl tho I do miss my snail a lot and have considered dropping out more than once, especially when I'm feeling shitty lol
@botsy_ regardless of what kind of winners we are, we are all incredibly stubborn people and this could potentially last forever
@botsy_ idk man I think I'd feel better if kyg won, if it can't be me
nothing like sonic the hedgehog shouting "I'LL MAKE YOU EAT THOSE WORDS" when you're trying to listen to enya
I forgot to turn off the ringer on my phone and it texts me when someone replies to a tweet jfc
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus that said I probably wouldn't either and I know kyg is more graceful of a winner so
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus my main concern is not letting you win b/c I just get the feeling like you'd never let us live it down
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus I mean I'd agree to let kyg win if you really wanted to
like sure if it was like "you're logging in from exactly your house!" I'd be like "creepy but correct"
but like it's not quite right
my "account activity" on tumblr indicates that my last four login locations are /almost/ where I live, idk how concerned I should be
Ideal road trip: follow guy fieri around as he goes to restaurants for triple-d, get interviewed at every one
bring jedward back to eurovision
this year's eurovision is gonna be real disappointing, I need to look through the entries again but nothing's really that great so far
especially when you follow up with the rest of the song
"VAPOOOREON
FOREVER TIL THE END OF TIME"
favourite pastime: taking words with same syllable count as the word "euphoria" &amp; singing them to loreen's eurovision-winning song euphoria
"make a cake for mother's day!"
alas, I bake for my mother all the time, it'd be like "here I did the thing I do anyway, happy mom day"
nerdy nummies is one of my favourite youtube shows because I just really like watching people make baked goods
plus hey pop culture treats!
haven't got all grades back yet but I'm optimistic abt roman history &amp; hopeful about usa history so w/ last semester's A+s I should be okay
the good news is that I got about 90% on one of my exams
the bad news is that's the one I bombed the second midterm, so it's still only a B-
@botsy_ I did paint apollo's butt once
got 10/10 on that project
what if I used this thought process on school projects
"gee I don't have a lot of ideas this time, better include david hasselhoff's abs" -me probably
@Dalkalopagus thank you it ended up better than I thought it would, I didn't have as many ideas as last time
hey @Dalkalopagus is this adequately noky and also bay 
@botsy_ "if you want a son too I know a guy"
@botsy_ "hope you wanted another daughter"
@botsy_ I would love weather like that too
I should move in with her
"hope your parents are okay with this btw"
@botsy_ europe
my friend from the netherlands tells me it doesn't get much hotter than that &amp; usually doesn't drop much lower than freezing
confession
I always imagined the boy discussed in avril lavigne's "sk8er boi"
to look like johnny bravo
diego could hang out with mom on the couch as she watches tv but instead he's chosen to hang out with me in an armchair
I'm very flattered
I need to attach a strap for my back to my computer chair so I stop slouching like a melting cave troll
he keeps moving around to all his favourite spots with it, making quiet whimper noises as he moves, as if he can't find the right acoustics
griffin has a squeaky ball we only let him have sometimes because he squeaks it endlessly and annoyingly but like
@codingcranium thank you, me too
he's made it through a lot of health stuff before, so I'm hoping for the best
he gets an ultrasound on wednesday, hopefully that'll clear up a diagnosis and hopefully it's treatable
griffin's got a potential stomach ulcer and/or swallowed something that's calcifying
he has so many meds now omg he's like a real old person
one of the girls in this j-drama is wearing a shirt that just says "BATTLE MOUNTAIN" with little hearts in the O and I want it
because I'm a lazy weeb ofc
(no but seriously I don't actively seek out new ones anymore but my faves are still so good though)
I love how the ps3 plays videos from USB sticks so I can watch my japanese television dramas from the comfort of my living room
@Dalkalopagus lmao yeah kyg pointed that out to me, but I've already put effort into including david hasselhoff on it sooo
@Dalkalopagus btw all I'm going on is the name "noky bay"
which reminds me of baywatch
idk exactly what I'm doing but please brace yourself
@Dalkalopagus do you have anything that you want on the cover
today I had apple pie poutine and it was delicious
what if I don't want the force to be with me
how is it so warm all of a sudden I wasn't emotionally prepared for this
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT TO WEAR TODAY AND IT'S UPSETTING
@Vidya_James I'm glad you can pick more than one cuz I just picked four
laughing at some spam about earning lots of money
how'd you know that I, a canadian, want to earn british pounds???
wow how have I never experienced the excitement of mail tracking before :O I know where my wig is! and there's an estimated arrival date!
oh shit
mother's day
oh shit
my sister's birthday
I NEED TO NOT BE AN ASSHOLE FAMILY MEMBER TWICE IN ONE WEEKEND
it's like "I CANNOT ITCH IT THEY WILL THINK I WEEP AND I NEED TO PROVE THAT I AM STRONG"
my least favourite thing is when there's something vaguely sad when I'm watching tv with my parents and my eye is itchy
a lovely sunny and warm day in early may
meaning the entirety of suburbia is out mowing their lawns jfc
I think it is a sign
we have bananas and strawberries so
unfortunately it is not yet season for me to awaken as smoothie monster
I've spoken with five people in the past hour, online and off, and three of those conversations mentioned smoothies at least once
@botsy_ so much for staying hydrated and efficiently eating cake
@luckyassdummy that is the cutest omg
@luckyassdummy aaahhh if I can get my hands on one that is the kind I want they're so cute
@luckyassdummy idk what kind of cactus I'll get, I think my oma might give me some of the one she has but idk what kind she has X3
@botsy_ you can try it first this time
@botsy_ I think I'll pass thanks
@botsy_ IT'S NOT /MY/ BIRTHDAY
@botsy_ have fun then, I guess
@botsy_ use milk at least
@luckyassdummy I might start with a cactus though I am an inexperienced plant mom and the internet tells me strawberry plants are work X3
@botsy_ please don't use water for that it'd probably just taste like soggy cake
@luckyassdummy I might try and do it indoors, if I can find space &amp; patience, cuz it'd be cool to have an indoor plant with delicious fruit!
@botsy_ why not both
time is fleeting
yolo
@luckyassdummy yesss excellent
I kind of want to try growing my own strawberries but I also don't like being outside to garden XD
@botsy_ it's okay grandpa ben
did you know that staying hydrated can slow down skin aging and wrinkles
@luckyassdummy so it's still about a month or two before I become SMOOTHIE MONSTER but I still make them whenever I can XD
@luckyassdummy yesss
I like making them when strawberries are in-season here b/c we buy tons, but sometimes I use grocery store strawberries
@botsy_ congrats on escaping the womb and orbiting the sun!
soon you will be a quarter of a century old #hbd
@luckyassdummy so proud of you ;w; smoothies are my lifeblood in summer
WHAT IF THE PRINCES IN SNOW WHITE AND SLEEPING BEAUTY WERE ACTUALLY JUST CPR-TRAINED AND TRYING TO ADMINISTER MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
this is why I need a butler
somebody hold my book up for me this is a real issue it's really good but really heavy and awkward to hold
I really wanna lay in bed and read this book but it's hardcover and thick and holding it while lying down makes my hands hurt ;-;
"communists in the funhouse" is one of the weirdest and best period euphemisms, though generally I tend to use "shark week"
the pronunciation of newfoundland is something I think about a lot
can't wait for fourth year where it'll be "DID I PASS? YES? GOOD"
genuinely unsure and therefore very nervous about two of the classes I haven't gotten my marks back for yet though
final mark for another class came back, got a B+ 
sliiightly disappointed, but not enough to kill my A- average (yet)
today I got a pink shirt that goes with my green skirt and visible white bra straps to achieve a watermelon colour palette
I am so happy
mostly because I used to order japanese CDs a lot
they were also the only CDs I bought for years
buying CDs here for not 60$ was like WHAT
it's weird to think that the wig I just ordered online will be here by next week because I'm used to online purchases taking weeks
today I drank Five Alive out of a hollowed out small watermelon
it was great
my mom mailed off the last $85 of my tuition that were for some reason unpaid, which meant I can't see my marks
PROCESS FASTER
@KayEffKay when I was little my sister &amp; I tried to eat various dog treats bc we were curious
most were nasty but this cheese one was p good
@KayEffKay it means you're luckier than I am because griffin's wet food makes me so nauseous that I can't be the one to feed him anymore

is it just me or are facebook "stickers" of sad cartoon characters inappropriate responses when someone posts abt missing her deceased child
@Vidya_James I forgot volga's name when I was playing hyrule warriors with some friends and called him vulva instead so
taking griffin to the vet basically means feeding him a steady stream of dog treats so that he doesn't yodel at other vet-goers
mom: "I put these apples out in the hopes that you'd peel them for pie or something!"
me: "so you just put out apples &amp; hoped for the best?"
I kind of want a pet bird but like
my mom had one growing up and apparently they're noisy as fuck and also my dogs are terriers so bad idea
this is the kind of news I want to see

I just remembered the nokygstopisgod neopets account we made last time I did a stream omg
why is the official backstreet boys FB page posting clickbait
@Gingerhazing there was a rumour in my HS that the girls' bathrooms had couches and all the girls were like "uh no?" but the rumour stuck
man I wanna play majora's mask right now but the N64's in the basement and the basement is cold
I need to get the 3DS version lol
went out just now to watch my dad play fetch with diego to exhaust him
it is a warmish spring evening
I am itchy now
curse the bugs
why is "phoenix" pronounced "fee-oh-nix" and not"foh-ee-nix" like it's spelled? english is crazy shit
"bechdel" and "bechamel" always make me think of each other
hello I like food and also feminism
@Vidya_James oh also are you aware of being able to get to ikana w/o the ice arrows (in n64 ver)? idk how it'd affect your run, if at all
"aw man spring allergies are starting to kick in"
*sits directly next to open window*
I'm not doing this on purpose lol I'm just sitting right next to an open window near where they're playing
current activity: eavesdropping on female neighbour children as they play soccer and gossip about something I don't know the context of
@Vidya_James ah, neat! I still need to get it lol, I guess I have cash now but I gotta pick up some eshop cards, I want the digital download
@Vidya_James are you gonna try this when you stream this weekend? cuz I'd love to see how this could play out
maybe it's a ploy to get me to play more frequently again so I have an easier time of stopping villagers from leaving
"did u know knox is sick? how awful!"
NO REALLY I DIDN'T CATCH THAT THE FIRST DOZEN TIMES Y'ALL COLLECTIVELY TOLD ME
dear acnl villagers: I KNOW KNOX IS SICK I'VE ALREADY GIVEN HIM MEDICINE JUST TELL ME WHO'S IS PLANNING ON MOVING SO I CAN STOP THEM
"limited product warranty! 90 days!" 
yesss
"U.S. only!" 
fuuuck
I liked the JVC marshmallows, but apparently I can't get them anymore lol
these are sony ones buuuut a month is a pretty bad lifespan
alright folks
earbud recommendations
preferably less than 30$
ones that actually go in the ear, not sit next to it like apple ones
I'VE LITERALLY HAD THESE EARBUDS FOR LIKE A MONTH HOW IS ONE EAR ALREADY BROKEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M SO MAD
man I am an entertaining tweeter 
I hope you appreciate me as much as I do, everyone
shit I accidentally unpinned my pinned tweet
it was from months ago
now I gotta find something equally representative of me but more recent
tell me your secrets, fictional young lindsay lohans
it's been like 9 months since I got mine pierced and one of them is still not finished healing yet
I am bitter about the parent trap showing a girl getting her ears pierced by a fellow camper at camp and coming out of it fine and yet
@botsy_ right up there with getting your ears pierced by a fellow camper amirite
@botsy_ I specifically remember 
"can I go swim anyway even though I'm not in my swimsuit"
"well...if you really really want to..."
@botsy_ oh also at girl guide camp once I went swimming in my regular clothes instead of my swimsuit, I can't remember what happened to it
@botsy_ yeah or y'know
get it confiscated
maybe have our parents told at the end of camp
(mind you mine let me buy them myself afterward so)
@botsy_ and we'd read it and then hide it from the counselors and it was exciting
@botsy_ that shit had like
guns and alcohol, man
and swearing if I recall
the first part of yugioh's pretty intense (and not card-oriented)
@botsy_ the wildest things we got up to at camp was that time I befriended a girl who had the first two yugioh manga &amp; she let me read them
@botsy_ I'd be more concerned about the ear piercing tbh
also "isolation cabin" wtf
this seems like a poorly-run camp
@botsy_ fencing, maybe!
but we wouldn't have free access to most of that stuff, nor would we be allowed at the beach without supervision
also the camp in this movie is lax as hell jfc
like I did girl guide summer camps
this is very not what they are like
I need to get this on DVD I s2g
I decided on watching the parent trap again lmao
rain ponchos are great and I need to get one, I used to have one as a kid but idk where it went
do I want to watch the parent trap again or do I want to watch sailor moon again hmmmm
dump cake is literally the least appealing name for what essentially appears to be a cake-based cobbler
@GoldfishWarning I guess florida has its ups and downs
btw canadians if you haven't had the timmies nutella donut yet then what's keeping you, they're fucking delicious
I honestly hate the concept of famous cosplayers anyway
and her costume-making skills are CRAZY GOOD for only having ~2 years of practice
I think she gets too caught up in the culture of "famous" cosplayers who are built real small and probably photoshop their pics and stuff
kinda concerned for my (already p small) friend who gets worried about losing weight for cosplay tho like
that shouldn't be what it's about
my hair is really soft right now you guys I can't stop touching it
honestly I'm still sad this cutie &amp; his fun song didn't win in the finals for spain's eurovision selection last year

nah a kappa's trail is probably more worth it &amp; uses more points
maybe I'll get kersploosh if I ever end up with a few extra bucks in eshop
oh but kersploosh looks really cute too hmmmmm
still really sad I didn't get elite status so I could get pushmo tho lol
oh hell I'm just gonna use the last of my club nintendo points on A Kappa's Tail. if I dither much longer I'll forget until it's too late
why do my feet hurt so much
the shoes I wore today were way comfier than my winter boots ;A;
FRIENDSHIP TAKES ITS TOLL
@smileysmile31 @botsy_ true but he was at his most "IT GON' BE OK" by the end of the third one so that is why I suspect as much
@botsy_ naw I seem to recall it was something about the future, probably from the third movie
I forget what the quote was, some inspirational line from the movie
didn't buy it because it was actually molting glitter lmao
today we saw a small wall scroll at value village that was a picture of troy bolton with glittery stars around him and a quote and signature
#FeministsAreUgly
"We'd be the stupidest rich people. We say we wouldn't be, but we're already the stupidest poor people." - @MoonMan422
also although it wasn't as continuous as I would've liked (woke up briefly a few times), I got enough sleep!!!
today I'm GONNA EAT POUTINE
@botsy_ drink some water
@botsy_ yeah but if that's enough to keep you from sleeping, maybe drink some water afterward, or drink the coffee earlier in the day
@botsy_ yeah but like
you can indulge while paying attention to quantity and preparing accordingly
INDULGE RESPONSIBLY
@botsy_ yeah maybe don't do that
@botsy_ so uh
actually
as it turns out
drinking lots of water, especially soon after drinking coffee, helps minimize the caffeine effects
sometimes I stall on my laptop before heading upstairs
dad just turned off the light on me cuz he didn't realise I was sitting on the floor
the answer as of right now is just two I wanted out anyway, but with only two spots to cycle through it'll take forever to get him back XD
discussing Important Animal Crossing Matters with an online acnl friend
mostly "how many villagers am I willing to let go to get hugh back"
@botsy_ it was fantastic but no I probably wouldn't describe it with the words "legitimately good"
@botsy_ are you kidding I was missing out on so much and I regret not having seen it sooner in my life
@botsy_ confession: the first time I saw space jam was less than two years ago
dates? yeah I've had tons of dates before
my mom makes excellent date squares
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus just like my hair and skin
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus my skin and hair do not have a whole lot of contrast tho, frankly it's easier to just feel if I've missed anything
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus idk using a mirror might be tricky when shaving your legs depending on how high up off the ground it is lmao
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus what about it
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus I usually shave my legs in the shower lol, mostly I just sit down in the tub and twist my legs around to see
@botsy_ then you can tell me whether ankles or chins are harder to shave around
it's an educational experience
@botsy_ you'd probably have to shave your legs first for tights to be more comfortable
@botsy_ wear some tights with the kilt if you're that worried about flashing the world
@botsy_ take chances grandpa ben, your life is running out
@botsy_ the construction of kilts means that that doesn't really happen tho
even in normal skirts I've only been wind upskirted maybe twice
@botsy_ idk it'd be pretty close to wearing shorts, just without some of the fabric
@botsy_ just wear kilts
@botsy_ lmao khaki shorts can totally be for everyone but I'm joking about them bc personally I mostly see them on my dad &amp; my grandfather
@botsy_ idk how expensive they are where you live but go for it
also start wearing khaki shorts and tucking t-shirt button-ups into them
@botsy_ get one
you're an old man
time is running out
you need to mispronounce things correctly
@botsy_ I've heard it from old british people too
it knows no national boundaries
@botsy_ no no if you were an old man it'd be elener
@botsy_ so much video game
@botsy_ who said anything about "many"
y'know I'm supposed to be an adult but today I played video games for so long I got a headache &amp; then kept playing
maybe I need supervision
@codingcranium tell her I say hi
drinking a mango banana strawberry blueberry raspberry smoothie
it's kind of weird ngl I think the blueberries are a bit too intense

Sweet, round, nice to see.
But even better when in me tummy.
wish I could walk in high heels because there're SO MANY amazing heeled shoes &amp; I wanna wear them :O
but my sense of balance isn't great lol
@GoldfishWarning I had let my weeds grow cuz I wanted the rose sofa &amp; I s2g it took me like 15 min of scouring my town to find the last one
@botsy_ that is wise 
#g2sb
@botsy_ and then go to sleep
@botsy_ exactly so
take something for your headache it'll probably help
alternatively eat an apple like my mom is always suggesting
I'm in the mood for anime so I thought I'd catch up on sailor moon crystal but it's just genuinely so much worse than the original show XD
@botsy_ probably from many points of view actually
@botsy_ ADVIL IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM COCAINE
@botsy_ take some advil and go to sleep
@botsy_ if you have a headache that is LITERALLY THE COURSE OF ACTION YOU SHOULD TAKE also maybe take some advil or something
like it's cool that sailor moon crystal condenses the show a lot more but it's just not as good, I don't connect with the characters as well
I want to watch sailor moon again without skipping any filler episodes this time, but it's 200 episodes XD
I watched abt 110, without filler
also I think in that case he's more allergic than I am XD I just get horribly itchy throat and nose and stinging eyes
and he was like "so am I but I still love them anyway.
I ended up in the hospital once from cuddling a cat too much"
this guy was hardcore
someone else was like "dogs are better than cats" &amp; he was like "no they're both great!" and I mentioned I like both but am allergic to cats
one of the guys who was also there the whole time with the therapy dog was the best though he totally got how dogs are literally the best
told my dad about the online D&amp;D thing &amp; he was like "...I had that idea like a decade ago. why didn't I make it. I could have made money."
I think it may be time to marathon danny phantom again
diego got all excited and then I grabbed my laptop and was sitting crosslegged next to him
I barely noticed as he started chewing my toes
@botsy_ the most ben moment in television history
Middle aged lady on the bus is totally using a discman omg. she gets my approval.
IT IS DONE
@codingcranium both of my dogs need to thoroughly sniff out the ground before pooping, like "ah yes, this is the spot where I should poop"
I should be reviewing for my exam rn but I can't stop thinking about dogs
there was only one therapy dog because it was the last day but now I am bffs with ben the leonberger!!! he was huge and very fluffy :D
today is the final exam!!!
and also hopefully befriending new dogs day
@KayEffKay yooo they have the D&amp;D 3.5 ruleset, that's the one I'm familiar with!
this is really cool lol
@KayEffKay @codingcranium ohh, okay, neat!
@KayEffKay @codingcranium wait I thought the DM was automated? putting in monsters sounds like a DM thing?
@GoldfishWarning thanks dad
I don't even remember what they were about because I don't have slides to reinforce them
I miss having class with that prof she was cool
so he wrote her back asking her to explain &amp; she let him have it
then he sent her the book with POST IT NOTES bookmarking noteworthy events
he'd written something and she'd written him a letter, commending him on it, but then saying that essentially she thought he was a shitty PM
last year my civil war prof had a sass-filled debate with an ex-prime minister that ended in him sending her a book about his time in office
I definitely like how I look with shorter hair and it's way easier to maintain, but I miss braids and ponytails
I think I just wasted my time reading two chapters of the textbook unnecessarily ;w;
@botsy_ that is literally 12 CDs worth of canadian music so like
it'll be understandable if you don't get around to all of it lol
@botsy_ oh wait are you doing the 1996 one? 
yeah I could see that having more music you'd care about XD
@botsy_ and then you'd be stuck with a canadian compilation CD
@botsy_ apparently you can buy it on amazon for like 40 bucks!
@botsy_ okay lol I was about to ask if I could get back to you on that tomorrow, I'd have to check the CD (it's downstairs)&amp; I'm studying rn
@GoldfishWarning the neck looks too long it's scaring me
@codingcranium @KayEffKay mostly cuz I'd be on my laptop and it's a 11" macbook air so there's not a lot of screen real estate XD
@codingcranium @KayEffKay I know I could download the books,but it's a lot easier to have a physical copy,esp if we're playing through skype
ugh now I actually wanna see if I could DM for y'all
but
-sister has the books
-it's a lot of work lol
@KayEffKay mind you I did have my character worship the DM in my last campaign, that earned me points with her
@KayEffKay real talk though DMing is at least twice the work of being a normal player, sadly it's not just being a god
.@GoldfishWarning 

idk if I'd be good at DMing but I think it'd be fun to try
only problem is my sister is also DMing a campaign rn and has abducted our books
@codingcranium @KayEffKay @GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock if the digital ver. doesn't work out I could maybe (MAYBE) learn to DM for skype D&amp;D
@KayEffKay @codingcranium @GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock I should prooobably download that before paying &amp; finding out my computer disagrees
@codingcranium me maybe? idk how much it is in canadian but I have some dollars right now
@GoldfishWarning teleport me over and I'll do the first part
@KayEffKay @codingcranium @GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock irl my last campaign had 6 plus the DM so if it does that's dumb
@GoldfishWarning @codingcranium @KayEffKay @TaocHoddock not it
@KayEffKay @GoldfishWarning @codingcranium that is a lot of pound
@GoldfishWarning @codingcranium @KayEffKay this is beautiful this is what I want in my life
@TaocHoddock I'm like 99% sure it was actually a gala though XD
this apple tastes citrusy and I am alarmed
tomorrow is an exam I feel better about being prepared for and also PUPPIEEEEESSSSSS oh my god I'm so excited
wait I also wrote my paper on roe v wade for this class
this is the american history class in which I am lazy and also a feminist
I literally just wrote my entire american history exam choosing just the questions and prompts on women's rights
WHATEVER
one more to go
I don't care if I already have the privilege of living at home with two dogs
I want to befriend every single dog
oooooOOOHH MY GOD IF I GET TO SCHOOL AN HOUR EARLY TOMORROW I CAN GO TO THE PUPPY ROOM
I want jupiter ascending to come out on dvd asap
I want to see it again
lately I have a bad habit of referring to everyone as a nerd
got to the slide that talks about the beatles
"ah yes. those nerds."
I wouldn't want to live in the 20s but flappers had really cute hairdos
by this time in two days I will be free
just gotta keep thinking about that
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 gosh gee now I feel I've wasted the past four months
"a man with reflective panels on his shaved head: disco bald" - papa cinnacorn
at this point I probably know more about american history than canadian history, I haven't taken a canadian history course since grade 10
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 also various rights movements
and apparently CRISES OF NATIONAL IDENTITY
@botsy_ sure
hey americans please sum up your history from post civil war to present day for me so that I can ace this test
if I were a teacher I'd start like every fucking class by saying "LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE NEEDS TO TEACH YOU KIDS A LESSON"
and I s2g I must have eaten over half the strawberries and watermelon pieces there oh my god
I really like fruit you guys
I went to a pool party at a classmate's house after graduation in grade 12 and his mom put out a huge platter of fruit
this is still the best painting from american history
"let's follow the floating lady wearing sheets! for america!!!"

transitions don't work in pdf format, please stop putting pictures on top of text
dear professor: fancy slides are cool when you're actually lecturing but how bout plain text when posting them so I can read the damn things
@botsy_ good cuz I don't wanna miss any of the curry conspiracy action
mom: "it's the queen's 89th birthday today!"
dad: "and we didn't get invited to the party?!"
jelly filled donuts are filled with jelly
boston creams are filled with custard
regular donuts are filled with T H E  V O I D
my dad saw me coming up the driveway as he was about to take the dogs for a walk so he opened the door and let the dogs stampede me :D
I'm gonna wear my captain america shirt to my american history exam tomorrow just to be obnoxious
okay now that I'm reading my notes I feel better about tomorrow's exam
I knew the concepts, just forgot names as listed on the review slides
still tho I think I did okay, and for better or for worse at least now it's over. two to gooo
"I'M SO READY FOR THIS EXAM" *opens first page* "OKAY MAYBE NOT"
just had the new timmies nutella donut and nutella pastry
hoooly shit I can feel my arteries clog in the most satisfying way
also someone has a caffeinated beverage on this bus that smells DELICIOUS
I hate spiders with a passion but my favourite superhero is spiderman, life is a mystery
overdone fantasy bullshit 4 lyfe
(also reminds me of good times chilling in @frumpystiltskin's car)

wearing Wizard Shirt and listening to A Trilogy of Fantasy in the hopes that overdone fantasy bullshit will help me through the day
the buddha's last words were totally "diligence, motherfuckers!!!" gj eleanor
gonna ace this exam
@Vidya_James you're always gonna be your own worst critic tho! I didn't watch zeldathon but it's not a bad thing to be easily excitable
this morning I have fluctuated between having "it's raining men" and a hilary duff song stuck in my head
it's gonna be a fun day
had a shitty night's sleep the night before an exam! :D fuck
(at least like I keep saying, this one's multiple choice &amp; I feel ready for it)
@botsy_ #ty
please everyone wish me a lot of luck for the next three days
god knows I'm gonna fucking need it lol
I still have a lot to study for the other two but I think I'm gonna be okay for tomorrow's exam :3
it's all multiple choice anyway lol
y'know for thousands of dollars a year you'd think it'd be easier to pass university courses
if I were a witch I'd use my magical powers to open up the best cafe ever and use my powers for cooking and restaurant maintenance
I mean there's still chances I'll need to take longer than four years but if I follow the four-year route then it's halfway!
it's weird to think that in less than a week I'll be halfway to getting my history BA like whoa
university degrees
those are for adults!!!
"Guy Fieri is like, negative proof of God" - @frumpystiltskin
stay tuned for me and @frumpystiltskin's new slasher film "dames, drive-ins, and doom" starring guy fieri
things I will never understand: bombing abortion clinics and killing doctors in the name of the "pro-life" movement
um??!????!?
I don't think religion is inherently bad or prejudiced by any means
but a lot of values of organized religion use dated social expectations
basically I am glad I took that women in religion course last year because otherwise I'd be even madder about this I think
like I get that it's stemming from v patriarchal societies spanning millennia but still, how can you blatantly disregard half the population
one thing that frustrates me when studying religions is when they're all "only dudes can achieve x form of enlightenment etc"
like thanks yo
man I'm gonna be SO PUMPED when this is all over
actually took a nap
idk if that was advisable, with study time dwindling between now and exams
I am a good student
for some reason it's weird to me that shoppers drug mart doesn't exist in the states, they're EVERYWHERE here
at least tomorrow's exam is completely multiple choice
I like multiple choice, it's quick and less stressful
@botsy_ I'd rather go to sleep
preferably until friday
and create a smarter robot version of me to take my exams
the compromise is probably going to be me playing dreamfall because at least it's on my computer, a device I also study with
if I sit down to play kingdom hearts I'll never get back to studying
but I really want to sit down and play kingdom hearts
just misread "whose line is it anyway" as "whose vine is it anyway"
I like my roman history textbook because it smells nice
finishing up the citations in my roman history exam and just thought, "wait when was the third century crisis again"
gee I wonder
"studying the textbook will help you as well"
naw
I pirated it anyway, I will feel no guilt if I don't use it
things I absolutely must do today: study
things I want to do: not that
it's been a long time since I ended sentences with a tilde and then an exclamation point all the time
maybe I should start again~!
@botsy_ same tho
when I was lil I used to imagine meeting a long lost twin but alas, we have too many pics of mom w/ literally just born me
@botsy_ have not seen herbie fully loaded but I will defend lindsay lohan parent trap to my last breath
@botsy_ disappointing
@botsy_ instead you can hear a beatles cover and also some nat king cole
I MAKE DELICIOUS BANANA BREAD
THANK YOU MRS FIELDS YOUR RECIPE IS EXCELLENT
WE ARE A GOOD TEAM
whenever I make batter-based baked goods I end up not noticing batter on my arm and then it spreads to everything I hold dear
decided to make banana bread to get rid of older bananas
couldn't find the bread pan
cake pan it is! I shall have a banana round
@MinTacoko yeah, alas! you'd look really cute with one too though, you should do it :3
@MinTacoko yeah, unfortunately I think it'd be in my best interest to remain nose piercing free X3
@MinTacoko I wanna get my nose pierced but my nose is v sensitive to seasonal allergies &amp; stuff &amp; I think a piercing'd make it suck more :(
the greatest thing about hard rock hallelujah is that it actually won eurovision
west ham is trending
but whatever happened to west egg
still waiting for one of the new piercings from last summer to heal, I'm so mad
the other one, on the ear I already had one in, is fine now
my mom made me earrings using posts that wouldn't bother new piercings but I accidentally broke 2 of them
none of my earring studs match rn
like they've just been misspelled for so long on that laptop, it looks wrong to have them properly spelled
my sister ripped a lot of music to our old laptop and some of my library is pulled from that computer
I can't bring myself to fix the typos
june is my second favourite months because it's my anniversary of escaping the womb
the whole month is my birthday I've decided this okay
december is my favourite month because it's before hatred of winter sets in and snow is still pretty but there are no bugs
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ I want to eat it
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ I wish there were more options for edible string, the only one that really comes to mind is thin licorice
@botsy_ idk I mean cheerios are essentially food beads
@botsy_ for future reference I have a bowl of cereal almost every evening
just tried to go to my tumblr blog by typing "eleanor" into the address bar wow
@botsy_ I was eating cereal lmao
the bead was on the edge of my desk, I accidentally knocked it into my lap while I was eating
felt something fall into my lap, thought it was a piece of cereal, just nearly ate a plastic bead.
eleanor is a classy motherfucker always
@GoldfishWarning that's like adult KD and ketchup
@botsy_ well I mean you did spend an extra three years in the 90s compared to me, you got more 90s exposure
@botsy_ what a true 90z kid
@botsy_ don't forget your pokemon literally everything
@botsy_ congratzzz!
@botsy_ probably gumby or something
I really hope I can do a good job making and maintaining a sailor moon wig bc I am pretty excited to cosplay her
I fuckin' love sailor moon
@botsy_ but were you a true 90s kid
@botsy_ honestly the best I can pin down for a long period of time is the anime kid XD that shit started for me when I was like ten
@botsy_ it's harder for me to pin down what sorta kid I was, my interests changed relatively rapidly lol
if justin tv were still around I would probably be willing to read children's books for everyone
my mom can make me go through the books aimed at preteens but I will die before I give up most of the childhood picture books we still have
@botsy_ there's a lot of unicorn books too though and that's understandable, my sister was definitely a mythical creatures kid
@botsy_ like, I knew actual horse girls! a lot of them ended up in Guides
but my neither sister nor I were one, why do we have so many books
@botsy_ they were books this time too
we have so many horse books aimed at ten year old girls?!
neither of us were horse girls, growing up
it is a reflection of my character that my mother expresses great joy when I agree to give away a significant amount of old stuff
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus eh whatever
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus I feel like child porn is farther reaching &amp; more damaging though so by virtue of isolation, noky g stop is not as bad
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus well noky g stop is better than child porn
therefore he cannot be worse than every anime ever
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus idk between us I think I'm prob the better authority on anime
which is kind of a horrible position to be in but y'know
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus very sure about that one, trust me
@botsy_ @Dalkalopagus noky g stop is better than borderline child porn and creepily sexualized young girls
so, can't be worse than all anime
@Dalkalopagus @GoldfishWarning y'know there is a LOT of trash anime but there is also some p awesome stuff so I'd say he's in the middle
@Dalkalopagus @GoldfishWarning ouch
there's just something exciting about bread dough
@GoldfishWarning @Dalkalopagus my hard drive was too full to unzip it
@Dalkalopagus okay thank goodness
@Dalkalopagus mostly I just hope you didn't spend over two actual days recording it
@Dalkalopagus y'know
I installed a new browser and deleted 3 anime series to get this to work
and I'm not sure how to feel about the payoff
apparently my hard drive is full and I'm running out of anime I'm willing to sacrifice D: after exams gonna do some major cleanup I think
@Dalkalopagus I s2g if you managed to make over 2 gb worth of noky g stop songs I'm going to be so concerned
basically now I'm just trying to decide whether I want to leave my computer on overnight (it's in my room and it's kinda noisy)
I wish I had like the fastest internet ever bc I am so curious about this noky g stop thing but I want to go to bed now, not in two hours
@Dalkalopagus of all the things that could prompt me to install chrome
I never thought it'd be noky g stop
@Dalkalopagus I am so so curious about what this could be but even after installing the plugin it's all "install the plugin" :(
@Dalkalopagus also it wants me to download a firefox extension to download something this big so it better be worth it
@Dalkalopagus I AM HONESTLY TERRIFIED AS TO WHAT I'M DOWNLOADING
I keep accidentally typing "adrianople" as "adrianope" which frankly sums up how I feel about exams right now
@botsy_ darn
@botsy_ 4000 rubles is like a hundred bucks canadian and I would still take it
@botsy_ actually the current exchange rate would work in my favour if you gave me american money
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ some stocks are up, some stocks are down, the 1% is still very rich, and eleanor needs a job
@botsy_  you're right you'd probably try and give me monopoly money or something
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning if you had four million dollars I would be a lot less understanding of your refusal to share money just saying
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning  that's four million
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning idk if I had that much I might buy many presents for ppl but I wouldn't just give it away XD
(also did you mean 4k)
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning SOME FRIEND YOU ARE
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning literally the only reason I work so hard in university is because they're giving me 2000 a year to keep it up XD
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning if I attend your stream and it makes me fail my exam will you pay me 4000 bucks cuz that's what's on the line
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning but alas I really will need to study for that exam lol
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning I tried to justify it, I was like
"watching an american play video games counts for an american history exam right"
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning speaking of which, you'll have to tell me what the scheming mayor is up to next week, I'll be studying for exams :(
had indian takeout for dinner tonight
well, I have had curry
@GoldfishWarning when I get rich and have my own personal orchestra I'm gonna call it that
@GoldfishWarning holy shit
@GoldfishWarning this is the kind of entertainment I need in my life thank you for sharing
also it reminds me of the kind of shit we pull
@GoldfishWarning haven't finished it yet but holy fuck I'm losing it at the whole goddamn cake in the rice cooker
things I should be doing
-studying
-probably walking on the treadmill while I study
things I am doing: not that
especially when size charts aren't listed D:&lt;
my least favourite thing about buying shirts online is when the shirt's manufacturer isn't listed so it's like "will this fit? WHO KNOWS"
@KayEffKay it's a good thing diego likes getting dried off with the towel lol, I guess it's close to being pet all over and he loves that
@KayEffKay maybe! diego also HATES the hair dryer so we don't use it on him, but griff doesn't mind so maybe it makes him feel more relaxed
@KayEffKay it's funny cuz griffin was never really like that, even when he was younger &amp; more energetic lol, he's just like "oh, I'm free"
for some reason diego, despite hating baths themselves, gets SUPER HYPER after one, he races around the house and wants to play
basically it's not just the student's fault if they aren't doing well or aren't engaged by a subject, teachers matter a lot too
meanwhile my amazing HS history teacher is a big reason why I even considered studying history in post-secondary in the first place
I'm worried kids who choose visual art for their grade 9 arts credit are gonna be so disenchanted by it because of how awful she is
in grade 12 my super rad HS art teacher retired, got replaced by another lady &amp; she was honestly a crabby pretentious dick &amp; it makes me sad
@GoldfishWarning I'm gonna keep buying keyboard phones until there's literally no more XD
if they do android apps that'll be awesome
it's okay to not enjoy or have an aptitude for certain subjects but having good/bad teachers also makes a huge amount of difference I think
@GoldfishWarning I saw an iPhone accessory that literally adds a blackberry keyboard to the bottom but both phone and keyboard cost a lot
@GoldfishWarning unfortunately there aren't many others, and no big names, trying to keep keyboard phones alive though
@GoldfishWarning not surprising lol, from what I've seen it's p different
anyway snapchat and vine aren't in the bb app store anyway XD
@GoldfishWarning blackberry curve 9320
it's using blackberry OS 7, which was succeeded by OS 10, the current one
usually I don't mind crustaceans but coconut crabs are terrifying
I follow ONE BLOG about pet birds and suddenly tumblr's like "YOU SHOULD FOLLOW BUDGIECARE, FLOCK-TALK, AND COCKATIELCOVE!!!"
mom's all "why do you have just the screen door closed all the time it's not that warm"
I haven't left the house in 5 days
I want fresh air
@KayEffKay I should borrow my mom's ipad and see what app hijinks I could get up to
mostly vines of my dogs I'm thinking
I wish I'd gotten sick of my flipphone this year instead of last year lmao
like I'd be interested in getting one of the newer blackberries because they can run android apps but
$$$
and I only got this one last year
the thing about my phone is that it can technically do apps but
it's on an outdated OS and it's limited to blackberry apps
there's not much
@GoldfishWarning @KayEffKay that sounds sad
@GoldfishWarning @KayEffKay oh lmao, fantastic
and yeah I'm on a 2012 blackberry
it's a moderately intelligent phone
this essay question should be three to four pages but I think I've made my point in two uggggh
@GoldfishWarning ...mola mola?
current jam: pop punk cover of taylor swift

I feel like I may slip below A- in some of my courses this semester (especially my religion courses)  lol but
I will try my hardest on exams
that's the first course I have my final mark in, too, and it's an A-! :D 
that is perfect with me, I need an A- average
magical forest boy TA gave an A for my participation mark, despite being a bit harsher for assignments
bless him I hate participation marks
this is around the time I usually go to bed but for some reason tonight I feel more tired because I was doing homework lmao
.@Vidya_James and more importantly, how have I not watched it yet
@GoldfishWarning and I'm not flour so
food is magical
I just found a recipe for BREAKFAST POPSICLES omg
it's basically a yogurt parfait, frozen into a popsicle
I want this
one time when I was twelve I misread the microwave brownie recipe and thought it said half a CUP of salt 
drinking game: tweet a lot about recipes, drink every time a food twitter bot favourites your tweet
@GoldfishWarning apparently there are a lot of cookie recipes that include coca cola
we sure messed up with The Flour Surprise
@botsy_ I started eating them like that bc I couldn't find a knife one time at girl guide camp so I gave up and ate it as-is
it's laziness
@botsy_ the only bad part was that I don't really like the peel, and also you can't eat one end of it cuz it's all bitter
"oatmeal nutella mug cake"
I'm going to cry this recipe is so beautiful
I think these four words are the key to my heart
@botsy_ yeah! I'd just eat the whole thing without peeling or cutting it
I don't do it anymore cuz it's very juicy, it's a lil messy for uni
@botsy_ lmao no but eating cucumbers whole is not a thing here in canada
idk what y'all little englanders do
@botsy_ re: cucumbers tho
I used to eat whole cucumbers in high school
I'd just bring one in, wash it, and eat it as-is
people were confused
@melodyadira hmmm! if you like caffeinated cold drinks, iced capps are great! my fave donut is old fashioned glazed but lots of 'em are good
@botsy_ infuse your water with STEAK and BEER like a TRUE DAD
@botsy_ no, energy drinks smell like urine
@botsy_ I have a water bottle with an infuser and I kinda wanna try it but yeah same, I might infuse the water and then eat the cucumber tho
@botsy_ this is a thing she said herself
 the concept of "detox" is kinda sketch but I am glad she grasps this lmao
@botsy_ of vitamins and antioxidants that are good for you."
@botsy_ "The secret is, water itself is the best recommendation for detox. Adding fresh healthy herbs and fruits only gives an extra income
@botsy_ true
also omg I went to the FB page, it's a cooking page
she posts "detox water" recipes every week and I was looking at comments
I smile at every dog I see but I have to be careful because I don't want the owner thinking I'm randomly smiling at them
@botsy_ the tiniest bit of lemon, mint, and cucumber every morning isn't gonna magically make you lose weight jfc I'm mad about this
@botsy_ friends of guys that have chimps on their shirts love fish
@botsy_ will he cut me a deal if I tell him I was referred to him by a guy with a chimp on his shirt
@botsy_ I should go buy fish from him I fucking love seafood
@botsy_ that's the best part
alleged health benefits are probably bc WATER IS HEALTHY
sticking stuff in it overnight ain't gonna change it
@DecayDJK maybe top it off with a nice dessert of antiseptic, gotta get all the toxins out!!!
a FB friend just shared a recipe for "detox water"
it's water infused with lemon, cucumber, and mint
it's not gonna do much but taste nice
"detox food" hahahahahahaha
@botsy_ he sounds like the kind of guy I'd want to buy fish from
@botsy_ I wanna be friends with the guy at that fish counter
I wish there was a way you could just like
put your acnl town in stasis
no one moves, no flowers grow, etc
I wanna not worry about it lol
@GoldfishWarning water
instead of barking to come in like he usually does, griffin just lay down outside the back door as if he'd resigned to a life of loneliness
labyrinth is a fantastic movie
that said I do wanna do some sort of activity this summer where I can cook over open flame, I have said this many a time
"20 things you need to do in &lt;ele's city&gt; this summer!"
they're all either things I already do or like, camping and yoga and shit
thanks
@KayEffKay good thing jasper's underwater right now cuz that was a sick burn
@KayEffKay correct yes good
sorry there are just some nerds on tumblr being like "it's definitely always sex!!!" no stop
@KayEffKay it's actually 49 so yes in that case
STEVEN AND CONNIE ARE CHILDREN
I AM LIKE 1000% SURE FUSING ISN'T ANALOGOUS TO SEX
@KayEffKay have you watched the whole series because I have a comment to refute this but it is also a spoiler for one of the episodes
solely because it has the line "the summer belongs to you" repeated
it's not even a very good song but it's a TRADITION now lmao
did you guys know there's a cascada song I've listened to after the last day of school for like 7 years now
I never listen to it otherwise
the answer is my dogs probably
semester one featured senpai and semester two was magical forest boy TA
what unknowing boy am I gonna tweet about this summer?!
am I the only one who likes making lil pictures with the crumbs on my plate after eating especially crumbly breads
@GoldfishWarning idk man
I should really be using my top one more often whoops, it's been months
so it's probably good this one's permanent
if you do not have a permanent retainer, please appreciate the feeling of not having food stuck in it half the time god dammit not again
that show was fantastic when I was ten and it's fantastic now
once exams end maybe I'll marathon danny phantom again
I can finally break out my fancypants new full series DVD set
tumblr's new favicon is like the closest thing it could get to hitting its goth phase
the ratio really doesn't matter as long as there's enough of each
it tastes like liquid creamsicle it's the best
if you ever have orange juice and vanilla ice cream/frozen yogurt and think
"gee I want something tastier than either of these"
mix them.
dogs, man.
I sent griff outside after he got sick so I could clean it up
when he came back in he sniffed the spot
sorry bro it's gone
things that need to stop: my dogs eating weird shit in the backyard
jfc I don't enjoy cleaning up dog sick
it was griffin this time :(
nothing is age-inappropriate at any level
I will physically fight these protesters with their dumb reasons
I'm so mad about this you guys
yes, okay, maybe parents weren't consulted enough in designing it
but it teaches important things I had to turn to /tumblr/ to learn
one lady claims that kids shouldn't learn abt different kinds of masturbation/sex bc they'll learn it on their own anyway
THAT'S /DANGEROUS/
"thousands protest ontario's new sex-ed curriculum"
IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE 1998
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TEACH YOUR KID THIS
STOP
@GoldfishWarning at first I thought it was christmas but apparently it was also a four-day weekend, not two weeks off? also no xmas tree
and mostly aside from that we just kinda sat around with my family and ate cute chocolates and watched some TV
there was a lot of snow on the ground &amp; I went to go neaten up the shoveled paths for the dogs, @MinTacoko helped but my sister was useless
had a dream last night
@MinTacoko, @botsy_, &amp; @smileysmile31 came to visit alongside my extended fam for ambiguous christmas/easter holiday
@GoldfishWarning that looks delicious, I wish it wasn't an ad for freezers
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 oh lord
@smileysmile31 yep! like I know you punctuate/capitalize all the time, but in some people that means they're being more serious XD
I CAN'T WAIT FOR STRAWBERRY SEASON THO I'M GONNA MAKE MORE CAKES WITH FRESH STRAWBERRIES :D
damn I'm looking at my cooking blog and now I want poutine
@smileysmile31 true but that's where context happens
plus "WELL FUCK YOU" is different than "Well, fuck you."
the latter sounds more serious
btw everyone please follow my cooking blog

@smileysmile31 it's actually interesting how the use of text communication online has evolved to make meaning and tone more clear though
@botsy_ you can tho I'm not gonna stop your quest for fart dominance
@botsy_ no thank you
@botsy_ well I mean even if farting wasn't frowned upon, it's still a loud noise that draws attention in quiet spaces and I don't want that
@botsy_ y'know I don't really wanna own them
I'd be more inclined to disown them in fact
you can have them if you want though
mind you that fart is probably the reason I am so paranoid about farting lmao
but that's my story about it
the end
and literally no one responded, it was the funniest thing, his attempt to tease fell flat. 
I remember thinking,
"nope. 
just you and me."
but then the next year in grade 7, there was this douchebag kid and halfway through the year he said "HEY REMEMBER THE TIME ELEANOR FARTED"
it was grade six and the room was almost completely quiet and I accidentally farted real loud
everyone knew it was me, it was v embarassing
.@botsy_ okay it's story time I have a story about one time I did noisily fart
I am not prone to noisy farts but accidentally noisily farting in a public silent space is something I am overly paranoid about
in-school exams are so much mental pressure and wrist cramps and also what if you fart
I like take-home exams better because I can eat and sing and take breaks and stuff while working on them
for some reason it did not occur to me that I could finish my roman history exam AND start studying for my other exams on the same day
I LOVE FRESH AIR
"by this time next week I'll be done exams...
no wait no I won't I'll still have two more by this time next week
fuck, that was encouraging"
twitter doesn't know how decimals work and it is going to drive me nuts
this is not what I wanted when I made ten thousand tweets
I should see abt reconnecting w/ her
I still have her faux-textbook abt fairies that accidentally went home w/ us
it's bothered me for years
just found a girl on FB I used to go to the same babysitter's as
haven't seen her in probably a decade
we have two mutual friends?!
@KayEffKay griffin does this all the time and it's THE CUTEST
he also bends his paws a bit so that it's harder to pull away lmao
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning juice is essentially fruit/vegetable water
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning apparently sweet potato juice is a thing and I would drink it
@GoldfishWarning 321 yam 4 lyfe
@GoldfishWarning I want this
I want all sweet potato dishes
@botsy_ this can be interpreted as your audience being children or the games being made for children and I think either is fairly accurate
regular potatoes are still amazing but I think sweet potatoes are the superior potato
@botsy_ 
@GoldfishWarning but with tights I can turn my legs summery colours!
@GoldfishWarning leg breeze makes me feel nekkid I went to get the mail last summer without tights once and it was bizarre
@GoldfishWarning eh, maybe
I like tights a lot
idk if the world is ready for my pasty white girlthighs
maybe not though
tights are pretty comfortable tbh, they make my legs feel nice
I wear tights every day even in summer and before that I used to wear pants all the time
maybe this year is the year I forgo the tights
I just realised that my legs have probably seen daylight only a handful of times over the past eight years at least
I just nearly wrote "in cahoots with the devil" on my exam
the prof is cool but I am not gonna take that sort of risk
"you're not like other girls"
oh no you found out my secret I am actually a fishwoman from mars my apologies
"you're not like other girls"
correct we are all unique individuals with our own virtues and flaws
if you want to compliment a girl
don't compare her to other girls or say she's better than them
no one agreed to a competition
for someone minoring in religion, I sure can't bring myself to care about this question on christianity in rome
maybe I can also ask them why my piercing isn't healing lmao
"hello I am dying of the plague and also my piercing keeps bleeding?"
(for real though as much as I don't like going to the clinic, if this keeps up for a couple more days I think it might be time to XD)
my stomach's been feeling gross for a full week now
that's it, I'm probably dying of a million diseases
drinking a lot of water is good and it is important to do
choking on water is not good and it is important to not do
when I'm at restaurants and I order caesar salad
it's not cuz I'm trying to be "healthy"
I just honestly really like caesar salad
sometimes I'll have my music on shuffle and I won't recognise the song at first and then I'll hear "YO WASSUP IT'S NOKY G STOP"
sometimes I forget about my doodled characters
like princess octoflapper, an octopus mermaid (a la ursula) who's also a princess &amp; a flapper
no one's gonna object that sonic 06 was a completely shit game but I still love Dreams of an Absolution and I will fight people about that
@GoldfishWarning well I mean it really was a mild case lmao
I didn't notice it doing anything at all
@GoldfishWarning apparently I don't XD
that &amp; I don't pay enough attention when things are on my computer
like my mild case of the conduits
I have a p decent understanding of computers but I'm still glad my parents and @GoldfishWarning are there to keep me from accidental doom
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ thank you for sharing because if you hadn't I probably woulda gone "hMM MAYBE I SHOULD DEFRAG MY LAPTOP" someday
I mean running around with no clear aim is something he does a lot anyway when he's excited, but if he's sick I wouldn't think he'd want to
diego, after refusing dinner because he doesn't feel well, just did fucking LAPS around the dining room at top speed jfc baby are u ok
I AM CURRENTLY REGRETTING THE TINY OMELETTE AS MY STOMACH STILL HURTS
I am currently making a tiny one-egg omelette with the tiniest functional frying pan we own
also it was diego and his getting sick is not as concerning as old man griffin, he probably just ate something
so D:&lt; deeeej whyyyy
I mean I feel bad when my dogs throw up but dear lord does it try my sympathy when I have to be the one to clean it up
the latest addition is a fairly large patchwork-covered lowercase e
"what am I gonna do with it?"
"I dunno I thought it was cute!"
I think I've mentioned this before but my mother has a weird habit of buying me things with the letter E on them it's actually kinda funny
honestly if it weren't for bugs and the sun being bright I'd consider joining him, it's so nice out and I like the fresh air
it's a nice day so keeping just the screen door closed
diego wanted to go out so I let him
he lazily walks across the deck to lay in the sun
omg I'm looking through this gem encyclopedia and there's a green one called hiddenite that's the cutest name
was drawing my own steven universe gem before bed
then I had dreams of desperately looking for watermelon tourmalines at a local craft fair
@botsy_ come back when you get more demons we need them to fuel our tour bus
I mean I could also learn how to drive lmao
but gas also costs money so really busing is the most financially optimal choice
it'd probably make a faster trip and I could leave whenever I wanted instead of whenever the bus came but
$$$$$
it's too bad I'm so far away from school and also not completely LOADED because man I wish I could take a cab to school and not bus
blanche asking to move in acnl: "I'll always think of this as the town I got good at collecting figurines"
god dammit not you too
@TaocHoddock @KayEffKay I know they're not the same as regular life but at anime conventions you can't go 5min w/o streetpassing someone XD
@KayEffKay @TaocHoddock maybe it's not as much of a thing in Europe but streetpassing is definitely a thing here! I get several at school
@TaocHoddock @KayEffKay the streetpass mii plaza thing is just a couple minigames
other games have streetpass capabilities too tho
@TaocHoddock @KayEffKay I bring mine to school a lot too but
plaza population: 1275
actual streetpass tags: 2399
I'm not even kidding tho, con staff will literally have their DSes on the table, open, while working at the registration table and stuff
you can laugh at anime conventions all you want but lemme tell you:
streetpasses
roman history exam states I have freedom in font selections again
I like the prof too much to use comic sans, though it is tempting
@KayEffKay ikr? I used to love looking at different gemstones as a kid and I remembered liking it a lot
plus I love fruit lol
one of my irl friends is getting a shiba inu soon so he's spamming pics of shiba inu puppies on tumblr and I do not mind at all
"mayo ring" - @GoldfishWarning's new phone
the olympics need to happen in london more often I want the spice girls to be on my tumblr dashboard again
I am so ready to clog up my arteries holy /shit/ 
@KayEffKay what's your gem :O
mine's watermelon tourmaline, I need to draw her tho
@KayEffKay my favourite part about her is that she's voiced by nicki minaj
my stomach STILL hurts
I'm so done with this, I need to work on homework D:&lt;
#explainyourusername I used to be "cinnamon-unicorn" on tumblr but the closest thing was taken on twitter
so I squished them together
@GoldfishWarning excellent that one's rad on you
@GoldfishWarning what did you end up wearing?
how squeaky would it be against your teeth to eat cheese curds and fresh green beans together
twitter, 10.1K means 10100 tweets
not 10050, it's been telling me I've had 10.1K since I hit that
way to count
@botsy_ thank you for the advice I'll keep this in mind
@botsy_ I'll trust you on that critique, I am more likely to find myself eating the food than listening to the singer lol
not the singer mind you I'm definitely talking about the food
meatloaf has such a bad reputation
my family's meatloaf recipe is amazing
geez you get sick for a few days and your parents eat all the good chocolate in the house &gt;:(
one of my fave things is that square enix listened to complaints about underwater combat in KH
so in KH2 atlantica is a rhythm game
they're making a teletubbies reboot?!?!?!???
@GoldfishWarning just wear your nicest shirt and some not-jeans pants and if anyone gives you grief fight them
@GoldfishWarning yo your business casual work clothes are cute and formal enough, to hell with dresses if you don't like them
firefox: "adobe flash player has crashed"
me: "well mAYBE IT JUST NEEDS TO DRINK SOME WATER"
how am I even real
that said, save the bees cuz we're kind of fucked without them
I know most bees are p chill and not inclined to sting unless aggravated but I would probably like them more if they couldn't sting at all
man clothing meant for guys is so consistent
I literally have x-small and x-large dresses in my closet that both fit me
so yeah that was my sister's first impression of me
and my parents were in the kitchen &amp; she and I were with grandparents in the living room
she ran into the kitchen
"MOMMY! THE DOLLY MOVED!"
story time for #NationalSiblingsDay
my sister is two years older than me
when I came home from the hospital for the first time, she saw me
it was probably unwise to eat the whole can of soup w/ an upset tummy but when all I've had today is a small bowl of oatmeal, soup is GREAT
@GoldfishWarning well it's an indicator of the glucose levels, right? that can affect texture
@GoldfishWarning I put maple syrup in, lol
it was a texture thing, the flavour was fine
@GoldfishWarning mom says the ones we have are even lower glycemic index than steel-cut? thanks for the message from our sponsors tho XD
there's a dog sleeping on my foot
I'm trapped forever
julian's asking to move (already!) but wow I do not have the energy to deal with villager trading right now. wehhh guess his stay's extended
@smileysmile31 does anyone suspect yet
@smileysmile31 this is excellent thank you for sharing
it must be strange to have to analyze your own stuff like this
I slept long enough! but diego woke me up cuz poor baby was scared of the thunderstorm :( so I let him on my bed and we slept another hour
I feel like I like the theory of oatmeal, like heck yeah oats and fruit, and it smells delicious but wow I do not like the texture at all
made some oatmeal cuz I thought it'd be easy on my stomach and I haven't had it in years
there is a reason I haven't had it in years
@botsy_ in my heart it shall forever be a 2
@botsy_ no it's gotta be a 2 it's just not the same without it
@botsy_ at first I was like "yes I said that why the redundancy" and then noticed I fucked up lmao
okay now I know there's definitely a stomach bug or something because I'm just about recovered from mental health things &amp; I still hurt D:&lt;
my sister @DuskIrises is a BIG NERD (but she is the best nerd) #NationalSiblingsDay 
(also griffin and diego are the best non-human bros)
how is it almost 11 I coulda sworn it was just 9
I was gonna try to go to bed at 10 lmao #gtse
because
y'know
bad bitches like me is hard to come by
like really hard to come by it's quite a challenge actually
I refuse to feel emotionally shitty again so I'm aggressively listening to starships by nicki minaj
@GoldfishWarning but I bought the honey shampoo bar from lush and now I kinda wish I'd tried the lavender one XD
@GoldfishWarning there are a lot of lavender shampoos! my old herbal essences one used to be lavender til they switched it to cherry lol
I really like the smell of lavender though like hell yeah
my new face moisturizer smells like it and it's great
man I should have gotten the lavender fancy shampoo
I got the honey one and the smell is too sweet when my stomach's upset XD
@GoldfishWarning thank you
@GoldfishWarning please clean your freezer
@botsy_ oh well in that case
@GoldfishWarning do you keep living things frozen in your freezer?!
@GoldfishWarning study the freezer
clean our your homework
@botsy_ it better be a really nice figurine
@botsy_ that is true &amp; I think he's aware of that but frankly I think cats are a more enjoyable way to spend 200$ than pieces of plastic XD
@botsy_ update: I think he went for the cat instead of the amiibos lmao
@botsy_ probably not, sorry
@botsy_ great now I have a reputation
@botsy_ noooo thanks
even if I didn't have an upset stomach I would politely decline
@botsy_ okay good because lemme tell ya
hygiene
@botsy_ also the ice cube trays are being occupied by frozen poutine gravy and I sure as fuck am not interested in eating that as-is
@botsy_ PLEASE BATHE
@botsy_ I'D REALLY RATHER NOT
@botsy_ thank you yes that is the plan!!!
(especially since I think the stomach bug is still a thing, eating is starting to get hard lol)
I think with my mom's help I'm almost out of the woods with this anxiety trip, tho I'm still gonna be gentle with myself tonight
I'm glad I'm finally getting to good episodes in STNG with my family tho, I didn't watch season one very often as a kid and also it sucks
other things that improve my mood: diego being ridiculous and wiggly
things that improve my mood: sherlock holmes episodes of star trek next generation yesss
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ part human, part robot, all guy fieri
@GoldfishWarning like me
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ robots can come in other colours you roboracist
@botsy_ I understand some people love collecting figurines and lack of supply can be frustrating but also calm down your life won't end
@botsy_ that said I kind of want one of those yoshi plushie ones because they're fucking adorable even though I don't have a wiiu &gt;.&gt;
@botsy_ same, like
it shows that
-people are nuts for them
-nintendo is not meeting demand
-it's just a bizarre capitalist mess
-gj nintendo
@botsy_ one of my fb friends is currently deciding whether to spend 200$ on a new cat or on two amiibo and I think that represents the issue
@botsy_ yeah that's just silly! consumers need to calm down and nintendo and stores need to pick up the pace basically
@botsy_ I mean I feel like there's fault on both sides, nintendo's business model is real shitty for this, but uh
calm down folks srsly
time to fight some nerds with my witty sense of humour
oh no the bonus question on my roman history exam is a CAPTION COMPETITION
the best ten re-captions of a cartoon panel get an extra 5%
@MinTacoko thank you &lt;3 I don't have anything due for a bit so I'll pace myself with games and homework and I should be okay X3
@MinTacoko like "ok eleanor maybe take a break", plus some school stress lately, so I'm keeping playing to a minimum til I feel better
@MinTacoko yeah haha there's been some villager changes in my town lately that really ended up upsetting me cuz they were unplanned so it's
@MinTacoko plus idk I'm trying to avoid playing acnl so much XD I'm getting too emotionally invested in it, I need to dial it back lol
@MinTacoko ah sorry, my battery's dead and I need to find my charger :(
@MinTacoko what do you mean
"I'm never gonna get a twitter account they're dumb" - eleanor circa 2010
I tweeted ten thousand times

btw everyone
my apple crisp tasted vaguely of kielbasa because the butter was improperly stored in the fridge, yum yum
told my mom last night that I'm having a rough time lately
she bought me mini eggs &amp; we're having my favourite soup for dinner
yesss ily mom
hey snow I appreciate that you waited til I was home but I really think it's time for you to maybe take a break for a few months
I love referring to my parents on the internet as papa and mama cinnacorn
brand new lays chip flavour: lay memes
whatever though, I needed the fresh air lol
when the prof said we'd have a short class on the last day, I thought he meant like an hour, not five minutes
ok I came to class to hand in my paper but also hoping to see my friend and she's not here D:&lt;
I ONLY HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS IN TOWN COME ON
I wish starbucks were an intergalactic currency and not an overpriced coffee shop chain
I wish I had a wiiu because tonight I want to play Windwaker but also be lying in bed
and I'm not saying dude artists are the only ones who do this, ladies fall into sameface traps all the time too
it takes unlearning
so yo please look away from media expectations and spend a bit more time looking closely at the women around you please
like if you have the talent to do that w/ men, then the only thing stopping you is internalized expectations for what women should look like
nothing disappoints me more than when an artist can draw incredibly varied faces and bodies on men but all the ladies look the same
oh man I'm less than twenty tweets away from ten thousand
@botsy_ it's p scary too, like they've deluded themselves into thinking that they're nice and good people and the world owes them for it
@botsy_ oh yeah I love me some strangers in full plate armour who follow me around creepily, ignoring my wishes to be left alone
@botsy_ yeah like buddy if I say no that doesn't mean following me around is gonna change my mind???
@botsy_ yeah like what are the odds you'll find an actual girl who is actually interested in you and doesn't think you're a creep XD
last paper is done!!! (which is good cuz it's due at 3:30)
now I get to wait til the end of the day for the roman history take home exam lol
@botsy_ yep
in hindsight I should have reported them but I was ten and not as aware of what was going on XD
@botsy_ interested &amp; there's a "follow" function in RS where your avatar follows another &amp; they'd follow me around til I ran away/logged off
@botsy_ like back then I was paranoid about everything I put online so I never mentioned how old I was but I always explicitly said I wasn't
@botsy_ lmao at least you were doing it on purpose though
I was just a ten year old kid wanting to craft runes and attack imps
and then I'd run away and/or log out lol
like you're that desperate for a woman that you'd hit on whoever has a female avatar
jfc go outside
it's not something I really thought about until now lmao
but guys would just come up to me like "UR HOT WANNA CHAT" and I'd be like "...no?"
the fucked up realisation that people hit on my female runescape character when I was ten years old
(I didn't state my age though)
LITERALLY THE PLAGUE

the demo for machinarium looks and feels like the lovechild of the neverhood and myst and those are totally my thing
apparently everyone's getting colds and meanwhile mine was like two days of stuffy nose overlapping with three days of slightly sore throat
@botsy_ that's what you get for buying emachines
@botsy_ it's the keyboard from the shittiest computer I've ever owned so I mean who knows what spirits possess it or something
@botsy_ sorry my keyboard's just trying to kill you again
whenever I feel down and school is part of the stress, I imagine how proud nicki minaj would be with me if I worked through it
@botsy_ drink your h20
@botsy_ what are you talking about, I totally had an actual fish face for a day! it was temporary plastic surgery
@botsy_ yeah I think I'm probably gonna go for /a/ game, at least, since my laptop takes better quality selfies XD
you guys I really love my mom
@botsy_ too bad I dithered too long and didn't try and get some more games to redeem codes for, cuz now code registration is closed
@botsy_ sparkle snapshots mostly just looks like a photo program with loads of filters &amp; stickers lol
probs just gonna go for the kappa tho
@botsy_ a kappa's trail looks really cute but then
sparkle snapshots 3D would make daily selfies a hoot
except the 3DS camera itself sucks
if anyone got gold status on club nintendo and doesn't want any of the rewards, get Pushmo and give the download code to me :O
@botsy_ I can only get one so I wanna choose wisely!
@botsy_ yeah, plus I didn't even hit gold this year so I can't get pushmo as a reward :( 
there are games that sort of interest me but like
I feel like with daily selfies I'd have a lot of fun with Sparkle Snapshots 3D but I also wanna spend my coins on an actual game
(preferably for 3DS, I don't have a wiiu and I don't use my wii that often anymore)
guys I have 220 coins what should I get with the last of my club nintendo points
@botsy_ just play animorphs while wheezing into the microphone
@botsy_ "shucks officer I'm not from around here"
@botsy_ hint about the canadian legal system: arson and murder are still illegal up here sorry
@botsy_ I mean I'm certainly not condoning murder or arson but also it just seems like a waste of time and gas to do it in canada
@botsy_ I mean there are probably girl guides meeting in buildings with kitchens that have microwaves and washcloths closer to where you are
@botsy_  I don't believe you
why would you drive ~7-8 hours just to set a building full of girl guides on fire in the most bizarre method
to this day we have no clue who that guy was and why he tried to bake a washcloth in the microwave
so that is the story of The Microwave Murderer, a tale from my and @GoldfishWarning's girl guiding adventures
for ages afterward we joked about The Microwave Murderer but when it happened we were all kinda nervous because like wtf who does that?!
no one knew why it was in there, none of us girls had even been in the kitchen that evening, so it musta been the guy who'd been in the hall
opening the microwave, our leader found what looked to be a washcloth. it was literally on fire. it must've already been in there a while.
so one of the leaders went to go check on the kitchen. no one was there but the microwave was on. it had literally 27 minutes left.
and earlier in the evening we'd seen someone pass by in the hall on the way to the kitchen. after a bit, we started smelling a burning smell
so a few years ago in girl guides, our unit met in a building that had a kitchen. one day, we're in another room working on some crafts
.@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning oh boy everyone it is story time!!!
there are a lot of changes in my life lately and I am going to work my way through them and accept them
bc if I don't I'll tear myself apart
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning have we shared the story of the microwave murderer before
@GoldfishWarning maybe they should stop using electricity it'd probably be more ethical for them
@GoldfishWarning if you're that much of a purist go cook everything over an open flame
@GoldfishWarning I mean technically it is radiation so if you wanna find a reason to damn it you could build off that but like
@GoldfishWarning I wasn't even aware that was a thing, what's wrong with microwaves
took a gravol on my way home to calm me down
it worked but I also nearly fell asleep on the bus XD
McDonald's ad: "My night off cooking!" if your selling point is "it's not made by you!!!" maybe rethink your advertising campagin
no fuckit I'm going home, I'll email my classmates to see if I can get the notes
and I don't know how being at home would help either anyway, it's not like I can work on my paper like this
I kind of want to go home right now because anxiety just showed up again but I'm worried something mentioned in class will be on the exam
@botsy_ okay enjoy your plastic figurines
@botsy_ you don't understand just how comfortable they are
@botsy_ your loss
@GoldfishWarning @Vidya_James there is def. that in SU but imo it does a better job of it
but if that's not your thing then probably pass XD
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ what did they ever do to you
@GoldfishWarning cool and fun plot about kickass ladies w/ some great worldbuilding, also it's created &amp; run by a woman &amp; has v diverse cast
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ lol they are definitely v warm so that's probably for the best then
also hey I'm an adorable owl in mine fight me
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ they are extremely comfortable &amp; I would be totally willing to pick one up for you this summer if you give me cash
@botsy_ blankets are less convenient when you're trying to do other things, these are better

@botsy_ figurines will not keep you warm on a cold winter's night
@botsy_ you're missing out then they're so comfy
I have classes back to back in this theatre but the first class ended early and now I am alone in this large room
@botsy_ save your money for better things
like dropped-crotch fleece onesies that look like cute animals
@botsy_ plus the dealer's room is a cool place to get nerdy shit lol, especially nerdy shit made by local artists
@botsy_ at first I started going cuz I was a big weeb but now they're more of a social thing for me, seeing people who like things I like
@botsy_ lmao I definitely understand that, I don't go to anime north (biggest in canada) anymore because it's so stressful and crowded
@botsy_ also anime cons aren't even strictly anime anymore like I run panels for video games all the time lol
@botsy_ and I find anime conventions more fun because it feels less like observing something and more like being a part of something
@botsy_ so I've run a lot of panels at anime conventions before but at comic cons panels are usually only run by people in the industry
@botsy_ anime cons are more ground-up, people can help run events and volunteer and stuff, where a lot of comic cons are corporation-run
@botsy_ I can't vouch for big american cons like anime boston but there's a difference between cons like comic-cons, and anime cons
@botsy_ anime conventions can be really fun if you know how to avoid the younger weebs and what events/panels attract them
@botsy_ but then idk I also find it kinda motivating bc I don't spend as much time on cosplay anymore as some people so I need to practice
@botsy_ no that's usually considered kinda rude bc no one owns the character but
I at least tend to feel jealous when others do it better XD
@botsy_ yes but then there's also people getting extremely upset because they're too broke for plastic figurines
lemonade is good
@botsy_ you'd have fun watching people at anime conventions
I wonder if any of the university vending machines sell five alive, I miss that crap
the sun needs to stop being so gd bright
they should make another spy kids movie except it's just about literal government communications agencies but run by children
cannot tell if it's warm (or dry) enough for running shoes but don't want to deal with my boots anymore
for some reason the only other place it stained was the sides of my wrists and forearms though? that washed out fine in the shower
the bath bomb I used today had so much dye in it that my fingernails are still tinted purple jfc
@botsy_ I'm seriously losing my shit over here every time I look at it
just
the smile
oh my god I can't stop laughing at this old pic I found on my 3DS using one of its bizarre filters 
I asked a musician on twitter when lyrics would be up on his website for an album he released last year
he said "soon!"
it's been six months
how dare my hair behave exactly the way I want it to on a day I don't need to leave the house this is just rude
played OoT 3D master quest for a while and now I'm expecting all my firefox tabs to be in the opposite order
out of all the zelda talking trees, the deku tree in ocarina of time is probably the most obnoxious, he's so hoity-toity
n64 games that need a 3DS port:
-banjo kazooie
-banjo tooie
-pokemon puzzle league
whoever decided ocarina of time 3D master quest should be mirrored needs to be fired because why would you do that
@botsy_ I like to be optimistic
@botsy_ btw if you get through both Seasons &amp; Ages &amp; can beat the final combined-plot boss before I do I will be disgruntled
it is not easy
@botsy_ it wouldn't be the first time a zelda character has done that honestly
tree wife is my favourite zelda talking tree
@botsy_ the tree in oracle of seasons is a waaaay less cute dude tree who doesn't want to marry you so please appreciate your tree wife now
why thanks, brain, I LOVE having music from pokemon shuffle stuck in my head
yesss I am going to take a bath
alright eleanor if you write half a page you can use one of your new bath bombs go go go
this is the final paper of the semester and I've got about a page left and I am completely out of fucks ugh
I wouldn't mind stepping back and taking a less-controlling method of playing like I used to, but it makes it harder to landscape the town
I think we're gonna have to get together and have some time traveling adventures cuz she'll want hers and I want hugh back
oh my god I don't even know what's happening to my animal crossing town anymore
the friend who took hugh, her fave villager is moving in???
man apparently I really like the smell of lavender
which is good because the new face moisturizer I got contains a lot of it XD
@botsy_ okay now #g2su cuz you're sick and I'm just really tired
@botsy_ also not my intent
I was honestly thinking about actual fruit
I really like watermelon
@botsy_ any lewd jokes one could glean from my previous tweet are 100% accidental because I need to go to sleep too
@botsy_ grand melon or
@botsy_ good
I have been in grandma ele mode like all weekend
grandma ele says go to sleep benjamin
@botsy_ and sleep a lot, dude, it'll really make a difference in getting better
my new shampoo has real honey in it
I'm washing my hair with bee spit
@botsy_ eyelashes are the true culprits of facial hair discomfort
@botsy_ they keep stuff out of your eyes and they're more trustworthy at it than eyelashes, who betray you by falling into your eyes
@botsy_ drink it
@botsy_ then maybe they're not hurting you
trust your eyebrows, ben
@botsy_ water
@botsy_ do your eyebrows have any reason to hurt you?
@botsy_ do you feel like they've been hurting you
@botsy_ intense eyebrows are a good thing
@botsy_ y'know I'm not so sure about that one
@botsy_ your eyebrows are p intense though, you'd have to shave half your beard on the other side to keep balance
@botsy_ you can borrow mine she doesn't live here anyway so I don't mind sharing
@botsy_ you may raise some eyebrows
@botsy_ yeah actually! strong-smelling things work too, like nail polish and also my sister who works in a fancy soap factory
@botsy_ your face will look so unbalanced with a giant beard and no eyebrows
@botsy_ I considered it just now but like
what if they don't grow back
@botsy_ no haha all her top-of-head hair
my sister shaved ALL her hair off and now she's gonna start taking daily selfies again to watch it grow
geez this is a theme
just accidentally misspelled "soap bars" as "soap bard"
dudebros who think cooking is too feminine are missing the fuck out
man I love food
sometimes I daydream about like, opening up a lil hole-in-the-wall cafe but I think I prefer cooking as a hobby X3
@GoldfishWarning as a feminist who likes cooking brought up by a man who likes cooking
I could write a paper about why this website is bad
dad almost couldn't find the regular barbecue sauce and we almost had guy fieri barbecue sauce chicken
@botsy_ maybe I should drink some water
@botsy_ idk I feel like it'd still be uncomfortable to sit with it on
@botsy_ idk I feel like it'd be uncomfortable to sit with it on
I should go get my water bottle b/c it is important to keep hydrated but dinner is soon and I'll have a beverage with dinner
and I'm lazy
I think I've just been voluntold to have a party
"maybe eleanor can serve those giant fererro rocher cakes at her graduation party"
"...graduation party?! mom!?"
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning drink some water
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning please do
thanks YTV this is the kind of terrifying content I need to see while scrolling down my facebook newsfeed 
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ hell yeah, even american dwarf-bearded friends
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning are you a dad
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ I wasn't even complaining abt discomfort
eventually it's just going to be a response to completely unrelated tweets
@botsy_ thanks you too
@GoldfishWarning @Dalkalopagus lmao I'll have to look around tho, like I know there's one my parents would wanna keep but I might have more
@GoldfishWarning @Dalkalopagus kyg I am like maybe 65% sure I might be able to find a cassette player to give you if you want one
dear bruise on the back of my hand: how did you get here and why are you invisible
geese and swans are such angry and aggressive creatures
it can't be good for their health to be so negative
apparently my sister was turning a corner outside a couple weeks ago and nearly ran into a canada goose and it stood up and hissed at her
first time I gave my sister music, the folder was "Music from your benign deity" this time it's "Music from your favourite space princess"
@botsy_ in the meantime
DRINK ALL THE WATER YOU POSSIBLY CAN
@botsy_ well get a lot of sleep tonight then because it will help
@botsy_ DRINK MORE
also go to sleep
@botsy_ drink some water
if I do as well as I have been doing on my roman history exam, I'm gonna get another A+ in this semester's roman history
fuck yeah rome
griffin has seen my grandparents more recently than my sister and yet she got one short bark and grandparents got an opera when they came in
@GoldfishWarning that's what we wanted to try but there were no chords for it lmao
and then I was like "charlotte why are we even looking"
probably don't play nightwish songs on the ukulele
it works!!! we are A+ problem solvers 
we're currently macgyvering a capo out of elastic bands, clothespins, and lego pieces fuck yeah
does anyone know of any capo replacements for a ukulele in a pinch
my sister forgot hers when she came to visit
elastic band isn't doing it
@Dalkalopagus rereading this tweet and it sounds way angrier than I intended 
I promise my intent was self-deprecation and not anger lmao
@Dalkalopagus maybe someday I'll have the money to haul my ass to that convention and you can laugh at me amongst the weebs too
@Dalkalopagus yeah lmao I mean I knew anime boston was around april so I was like "HMM" (and I checked, it is this weekend)
@Dalkalopagus is it sad that I probably know which one it is
I like the smell of yeasty bread dough cuz it reminds me of my grandpa who passed away when I was little XD
we used to make bread with him!
this just in: apparently I can't eat straight-up uncooked pepperoni anymore without being reminded of nougat and chocolate
dad: "well, the pizza dough has risen"
mom: "how very easter of you"
maybe eventually if I can cycle through 16 villagers I'll be able to pick him up again
so I'm pretty sad but I know I can still visit him
update on hugh in acnl: a friend (of a friend, more accurately, but we are becoming friends) had space in her town and took him in so that
Hugh is moving tomorrow in acnl how did this happen I'm going to cry
I look really cute today you guys
for some reason as a kid, spelling "goose' on the calculator was infinitely more exciting to me than spelling "boobs"

actual doody

for real buttjunk
for some reason prefacing "poo" with "literal" always makes me giggle
it's not just poo
it's literal poo
like I know some medieval remedies were like "PUT LITERAL POO ON IT" but at the same time, plants and stuff can help with some things
@GoldfishWarning probably not
"medieval remedy kills modern superbug"
gee it's almost like some medicinal ingredients continue to be medicinal
apparently frozen &amp; reheated poutine gravy doesn't have the same texture but it tastes the same and I got rid of all the cheese curds so :D
smiley fry poutine for brunch and homemade pizza for dinner fuck yeah
@botsy_ my water-drinking game is so strong that I have a humidifier right next to my bed so I can inhale water while I sleep
my eyelid is itchy??? why is this happening to me
@botsy_ actually tbh I was almost gonna resort to childhood pictures again cuz I couldn't care enough, so I mean at least you have an excuse
@botsy_ tsk tsk how dare you go do enjoyable things instead of posting pictures of yourself on the internet
I have no intent to even make this recipe why the fuck am I reading its reviews
things I should be doing: homework
things I am doing: reading reviews for an alfredo sauce recipe on the food network website
@botsy_ doot doot selfie police
"I should go work on homework" "I should go to bed" my sister &amp; I mutter to each other as we continue to sit in the living room on laptops
@GoldfishWarning damn right
@GoldfishWarning IT WAS A TWEET ABOUT HOW MUCH I HATE PEELING POTATOES
why are all these random-ass ladies favouriting a tweet I made a week ago about peeling potatoes
I'd say "water is my best friend right now" but I'm pretty sure it is generally frowned upon to consume one's best friend
for someone who loves food, it's kind of bizarre that more than once I've forgotten that the sensation of hunger can be solved by eating
I napped! menacing throat tickle is still there but I am also chugging water so I hope it fucks off before long
@botsy_ too bad this year isn't a leap year lol, extra day of beard
some days I play for like 10 minutes &amp; some days I play for like 3 hours
@botsy_ I've positioned four villagers with resetting, and then also reset a LOT to get blanche in the campsite
@botsy_ horror, means I've spent over 35 hours plot resetting
@botsy_ I got my game in august 2013, my activity log says 535 hrs but I still don't have the 500 hrs badge from phineas yet, which, to my
@botsy_ AC wiki says "High approval rating, can be gained from planting many flowers quickly, etc."
so you're making your town nice!
@botsy_ one time I helped kyg clearcut her town cuz I had the gold axe &amp; she didn't, &amp; then all MY villagers were all "YOU'RE A STUMP MAKER"
@botsy_ yeah I've been doing a lot of rearranging and hybrid breeding lately XD
better than my villagers lying about my finances
@botsy_ if you plant all those trees &amp; flowers phineas may also be like "whooOA GARDENING FAN"
for some reason replanted flowers don't count
@botsy_ lol yeah basically just buy lief out every day, 50 flowers gets the silver watering can and 50 fertilizer bags gets the gold shovel
@botsy_ and it only sometimes makes pretty patterns lol
also I can't play rn because homework but soon I will bequeath the axe unto you
@botsy_ okay! :D do you have the gold one? that one's easier to get but takes longer, you have to buy 50 trees from leif. doesn't break tho
@botsy_ they do break, although it takes a bit longer than the normal axe, so only use it when you specifically want patterns
@botsy_ do you want a silver axe? they make patterns every time and I bought a whole bunch b/c they're rarely sold on the island
@botsy_ sounds good :D
but yeah after frita moved in somewhere super isolated and took forever to leave, I was like "NEVER AGAIN"
@botsy_ eleanor advises on how to be a control freak in animal crossing
@botsy_ if there are places you don't want joey to go, you can set up something today and something tomorrow, at least
@botsy_ I think next time I get someone new I'm gonna place a fuckton of PWPs everywhere I don't want them to go lol, make things easier
@botsy_ but if you wanna be 100% sure he moves in in a decent spot, it gives you way more control
@botsy_ yep! so if you get joey in, that'll be the day after tomorrow. it's p tedious cuz you have to keep talking to the cat on the train
@botsy_ that's how I fucked up placing julian, I accidentally loaded my own file
@botsy_ basically isabelle saves your town when she loads an existing file but new files don't save til the house is built, so you can reset
@botsy_ if you don't like where the plot is
@botsy_ start a new file BEFORE loading your own file at all that day, check where the plot is, build a house and save if you like it, reset
@botsy_ also if you get him to move in, there'll be nothing tomorrow &amp; his plot will appear the day after, if you wanna do plot resetting XD
@botsy_ will eventually agree
@botsy_ you gotta keep talking to them, like sometimes it can take forever, even if they say "nevermind" at first when you invite them they
@botsy_ btw if you don't adopt him, since you have eight the game will give you a ninth in a few days, just so you're aware
@botsy_ wow he has the plainest face
@botsy_ I know right
also I hope it's not harry because I have a special hatred for him because he took forever to leave my goddamn town
@botsy_ then I hope it's not katt or tabby because they are ugly as sin
@botsy_ I hope it's benjamin
@botsy_ awh man :( hope you get someone else cool after that shit luck
@botsy_ D: is everyone else still there? did you end up with someone new?
if I have to deal w/ a cold I would prefer it wait til wednesday when my last paper is due
then I have a week or so I can spare for illness
@botsy_ thank you! so far there's just a menacing tickle in my throat but I don't want it to get worse lol
there are japanese trending tags and they're in an alphabet I used to know and my 15-year-old self is disappointed in me for not remembering
@botsy_ that's the plan!!!
maybe I'll take a nap this afternoon too if I can
@botsy_ hopefully cold symptoms will not return due to this lack of sleep
time to chug more water
@botsy_ hopefully I will not be a total grump today lol
@botsy_ I tried :( I went on the computer to check something (and go on twitter lol) &amp; then tried to get back to sleep &amp; nothing happened :(
@botsy_ apparently, as my body has decided that sleeping in isn't a thing I can do anymore and yet I still stay up til 2AM D:&lt;
@botsy_ my favourite thing is how the two things we joke about, drinking water and going to sleep, are exactly what saved the day
cold-like symptoms are gone (for now?! D:&gt;)
guess I drank enough water
all of a sudden I'm feeling really down about myself and sad, like my mood dropped and took my self esteem with it
@Dalkalopagus @botsy_ @GoldfishWarning well idk wouldn't be surprised if harper tried to outlaw physics
@Dalkalopagus @botsy_ @GoldfishWarning it's true tho
we are not allowed to be like gumby
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning he's keeping us all in the dark
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning yes
it's our fault not yours, do not feel negative emotions when we do not understand
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning just assume we are little infants who have not had the same worldly experiences as you &amp; you should explain things
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning gross
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ pea soup? wtf ben
@botsy_ :( I'm so sorry, I hope it all works out and your town's okay
@botsy_ yeah me too! I am very well acquainted with ac causing stress when it is supposed to be a de-stresser lol
@botsy_ you might be able to ask isabelle to change the time before you load?
@botsy_ oh boy
keep us posted, I hope everything's alright
@botsy_ D: is your town okay
gonna try and get rid of this cold-like feeling in my nose with sheer will power and
by drinking a lot of water
@GoldfishWarning the skullcandies are 50$ headphones and as such don't totally suck but god damn do they pinch my ears
@GoldfishWarning I mean I'd take shit sound quality as a more gentle reminder
the ipod earbuds provide me with both pain and bad quality
I can once again listen to music without physical pain this is a miracle
why are all my emergency headphones so hurtful
@botsy_ that's good lol
I've seen people who are just always mad and it doesn't seem healthy
hmph away then
@botsy_ idk I feel like being mad at people just cuz you're not big on people is kind of a waste of energy XD
if this tickle and slight pain in my nose is a cold I'm going to rip it off and live life as voldemort
@botsy_ generally it leads to feeling happier
maybe you should try yoga or something
summertime clothing goals: PJ shorts
the only time I get new PJs anymore is christmas and as a result most of my PJ pants are flannel
@botsy_ I think you need more positivity in your life
have you tried not being mad
my earbuds are discontinued :( I liked the foam tips instead of rubber. but I still have tons of extra tips &amp; they fit on this new pair lol
@botsy_ if that upsets you you're gonna end up mad at a lot of people in your life
@botsy_ yeah I think people just end up with differently-shaped ears and they were designed for like, steve jobs's ears or something
@TaocHoddock yeah I only used them today cuz my good ones broke and I didn't want to be without music on the bus but
gdi OW
maybe my ears are just shaped weird or something
hopefully getting a new pair of the earbuds I like this evening though
how do people actually use ipod earbuds full-time tho
they feel like they're bruising the entrance to my ear canal, am I wearing them wrong?
the bus ride home is actually p scenic but like all the buses need a car wash after winter muck &gt;:(
guy in front of me's taking written notes and his notebook has a ton of extremely eyelash-y eyes doodled
I feel a sense of kinship here
@GoldfishWarning tape + paper?
@GoldfishWarning that's where a bandaid might help? cuz then you can put the pad bit over the camera itself
@GoldfishWarning like I said it's up to what you're comfortable with but personally I don't care XD
@GoldfishWarning yeah but like
imo, what are they gonna see? laptop is closed when I'm not using it &amp; I don't undress around it or anything
@TaocHoddock @GoldfishWarning  do it and be a COOL KID
@GoldfishWarning also I've seen people use stickers too but depends on the adhesive lol, might not be so easy to peel off again
@GoldfishWarning I don't do it cuz I take selfies daily but I know a lot of people who do
I think it's up to what you're comfortable with
I think I might be falling in love with Fang in ACNL
maybe I'll try and trade julian for him
I'll have three little pigs and a wolf!
my face hurts and I want a nap
@botsy_ what about sophisto
it's too bad my dogs are so noisy because damn I'd love to just randomly bring them to class
the days are long without my puppies
a couple of my friends reblogged yesterday's april fools selfie and now strangers are reblogging it???
it's just a photoshop guys lmao
I haven't been paying attention to a thing that's been said because I'm fretting about feeding people
good studenting, eleanor
the one downside of doing it like this is that they don't know it's me and therefore can't LOVE ME
this has been eleanor livetweeting trying to distribute cookies while dealing with mild social anxieties
whatever I'm friendly with all the girls to my left I'll tell 'em to hold on a sec at the end of the class
@GoldfishWarning  naw like the room's set up in a ring but there's a gap between the people at one corner and the TA
@GoldfishWarning what am I gonna say tho like
"can you go get the bin of cookies despite being almost as far away from it as I am"
and I don't wanna get up and move it along because I am a nervous individual about drawing attention :(
but it stopped at the gap before the TA and now she wasn't grabbed any and the five people to my left haven't gotten any D:&lt;
now people are whispering because no one knows who started it hahahahaha I am a cookie ninja
put a sign on the cookies saying "take two and pass it on!" and then passed it to the person beside me lmao
subtle cookie distribution
@GoldfishWarning or unable to paint
(I mean it's from repeated exposure and I only did it a few times but still, I had no idea XD)
apparently fingerpainting with acrylic paint can cause nerve damage
hahah high school art class whoops
because bus was late, class had already started
how do I hand out cookies now
Canada gets kind of screwed.
bad feeling about today confirmed. bus has decided to just not show up! :D
the earbuds that come with ipods are gross and uncomfortable jfc
just almost jaywalked in front of a police car lol whooops
today I want to wave my arms noncommittally and go "UNGGGHHHH" a lot
why do I have a bad feeling about today this is concerning
it would probably be rude not to tho since idk if the few people in both groups overheard me talking about bringing more in today XD
I should probably bring cookies in for my other discussion group b/c we have so many but like
idk I just didn't connect as much w/ them XD
@botsy_ the ds kids these days are so lazy by your age I could afford a house and a car
@botsy_ the ds back in my day we had no eshop we had to walk uphill both ways in a snowstorm to buy new games
@MoonMan422 well uh
I recognise him at least?
@botsy_ ds you kids get offa my lawn with your fancy 3D visuals
@botsy_ ds elderly
@botsy_ the DS-with-girth
@botsy_ the DS weighty
@botsy_ lol I call it that because I remember when the DS lite came out everyone started calling the old one the DS fat
windwaker is always gonna be my favourite zelda for soundtrack honestly
the ocean theme while you're sailing is so good omg
@botsy_ I should probably actually play link to the past first lmao
I wish it was available for the 3DS so I don't have to use my old fat DS
@botsy_ gdi now I wanna play LBW again too
@botsy_ hey good job!
wasn't kidding about the whole "FAKER I THINK YOOOU'RE THE FAKE HEDGEHOG AROUND HERE" thing in acnl btw 
I actually genuinely like rickrolling because it's such an inoffensive prank
like no one's scared or hurt just "AW DANG YOU GOT ME"
and then occasionally "FUCK YEAH MY BRO KANGASKHAN"
playing pokemon shuffle while only vaguely knowing anything more than gen1 &amp; 2 is entertaining
"yeah cute bunny thing!" "go creepy gem guy!"
also I'm done being kyg it was fun but I was even messing myself up
people who are okay with bugs are made of stronger stuff than I am
today I received a brutal reminder of why, aside from christmas, winter is my favourite season
big fast-moving centipede in the house DDD:&gt;
"y'know, if you're a pearl, your oyster IS your world" - papa cinnacorn dropping some deep thoughts while putting leftovers in the fridge
april fools day in animal crossing new leaf aka
FAKER? I THINK YOU'RE THE FAKE HEDGEHOG AROUND HERE
@DecayDJK good.
my goal every april fools is usually to put everyone in a deeper state of confusion than I normally elicit
my school email is broken, what a great april fools joke
oh man I'm glad neopets hasn't lost their strong april fools game
now I'm kyg writing a history paper!
woke up and I'm still kyg!!!
@botsy_ oh you sure got me!!!
@botsy_ then why are you on twitter
@botsy_ april fools
@botsy_ don't forget to drink some water first
@GoldfishWarning surprise they're building you a treehouse
@botsy_ go to sleep benjamin
did you guys know I have a cat and not two dogs
@botsy_ good, then you agree that she is the coolest?
@botsy_ are you implying eleanor is not the coolest person on the planet?
My favourite movie is Spy Kids 3D. I think it is a masterpiece.
did you guys know eleanor is the coolest person on the planet
hi everyone I'm kyg and I do the computers
how do you sblounskch something
what does it mean to sblounskch
how does one become sblounskched
I wish I could know what I smell like though
I hope I don't smell bad lol
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 can't imagine it's a very popular scent
@botsy_ exactly but what does that smell like
I mean most people are nose-blind to their own &amp; smell's hard to describe through words anyway
@botsy_ but everyone smells different tho
one thing I wonder about my online friends is like
everyone has a natural smell, right
so what do y'all smell like
also it is weird to not have music directly deposited into my ear canals holy shit
the headband bit broke years ago so they're not good for mobility but both speakers still work so I use 'em when earbuds die
using my backup headphones tonight, a pair of bright red skullcandy headphones (not earbuds). woohoo ear pinchies.
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 which begs the question, which of you is the cheetah and which is the zebra
@GoldfishWarning DON'T DO IT
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 just make them both pretend to be you two and see what they come up with
@GoldfishWarning SAME
@Dalkalopagus @GoldfishWarning @botsy_ PLEASE
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ stream using sheer willpower
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning NEXT TIME YOU'RE AROUND THEM
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning or stream playing children's games with them it would be so fun
@botsy_ aight cool thanks, have fun lol
@botsy_ bro u streamin' tonite
gotta know so I can do some hardcore time management
@GoldfishWarning oh no
am I losing my youthful glow
just got "ma'am"ed by a transit officer while all the other ladies around me were "miss" gdi
@GoldfishWarning #7 600 :D
I'd probably still dislike him heartily but I think stephen harper would benefit from growing facial hair
it's weird to me that clinton was a president in my lifetime because bush jr is the first one I actually remember and was aware of
one of my earbuds broke :(
I think I still get one more free one from the warranty though, so maybe tomorrow I'll get a new pair
@botsy_ thank u benjamin
pokemon shuffle is probably going to become a problem for me
I want my university to build slides everywhere
is the movie trope of high school queen bee characters wanting to maintain clique systems a metaphor for social order in western society
usually I only bring cookies for discussion groups and small classes but like
this recipe could probably legit feed a whole lecture class
oh god now I know how to make poutine
my poor arteries
I did not know kickball and soccer-baseball are the same thing
@botsy_ probably lol
@botsy_ what
@botsy_ yeah but kippah is only two syllables lol
"that little hat thing some jewish people wear" professor you have a doctorate in religion
so glad the semester's almost over though lmao
almost halfway through university!!!
I understand profs mark harder when they give big exam questions beforehand but like
it makes me feel way better to be able to plan shit out
still shitty because I need to keep my average above 80% but
a bit less shitty lmao
YO I forgot that midterm was out of 48 and not 50!
this bumps me from a 65 to like a 68, which might be a bit easier to recover from lol
@botsy_ soon I shall fulfill my dream of hydrating everyone in the world
@botsy_ WOW
I wish it was
whatever I already gave them cookies they already love me
just made a really loud "ugggghhhh" noise during this activity about wikipedia, just as the class randomly went silent
my cookies are mfbta's breakfast whoops
mfbta is LATE AND I BROUGHT COOKIES
maybe forest matters have him held up
it is spring after all
@botsy_ tbh I'm surprised at myself for not seeing that coming
I think I slept on my shoulder funny because now it's sore
boooo
I think about this video a lot b/c it makes points about studying history and also b/c it's hilarious (cc @botsy_)

this video has a surprising amount of significance to my childhood
it is very important to me

@GoldfishWarning tbh I really feel like black hair would look pretty bad on me
@botsy_ #brownsweatshirt and #greysweatshirt transcend time
@botsy_ #brownsweatshirt didn't exist back then, I think I got it when I was like 13 lmao
@botsy_ I wish the shirt I was wearing in that picture came in adult sizes tbh
@botsy_ also I knocked down my sister's blocks all the time, earning me the nickname "baby godzilla"
@botsy_ surprisingly I don't think I was a put-shit-in-my-mouth kid
I was a leash kid though
@botsy_ why did you swallow a marble
@botsy_ this is very true
one time I accidentally licked my lips while washing my face
I licked soap
I was sad
@botsy_ won't drink bubble bath? probably a good plan
@botsy_ go for it!!!
I had a bath tonight but I didn't drink it
mostly because I used bubble bath
don't drink bubble bath
@botsy_ GOOD CUZ IT'S IMPORTANT
@botsy_ good
it's important to stay hydrated
uggggh I happened across a guide to dangerous spiders and there are several that are in ontario and ugggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
@botsy_ ur welcome
remember to stay hydrated
@botsy_ for being so hydrated, you have earned yourself another glass of water.
@botsy_ but are you hydrated
@botsy_ I'm actually really thirsty tonight for some reason so I am in fact chugging a lot of water lmao
ALSO APPARENTLY BEING WELL-HYDRATED HELPS YOU STAY WARM
TAKE THAT, NAYSAYERS
apparently mosquitoes are more attracted to blonde people
D:&lt;
tonight I took a bath :D
but it's p cool cuz she's taken the same programs I'm doing/planning to do at the same schools, so she can tell me about what it's like :3
apparently somehow I've ended up following the same post-secondary education path as one of my girl guide leaders, she's a younger leader
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning crowdfund the wedding ring
let the girl put it to a vote
invite the crowd to the wedding
let them pick baby names
these two people on the bus are playing 2048 on a phone and they have NO strategy
@KayEffKay tbh I pretty much exclusively say JFK to refer to the president now because it mixes me up otherwise
prof thinks this timeslot is the worst class timeslot
I get to sleep in and also be home in time for dinner? this is the best timeslot
there is an emperor during the very late days of the roman empire named maurice
nvm their class ended early lol
there's like 10 min til the previous class leaves the classroom and this hallway is too warm &gt;:(
it's like...snaining right now. weather please make up your mind
one thing I miss about girl guides is camping and cooking food with open flame, that was always so fun
@botsy_ alright I am g-ing 2s for real, goodnight
also #g2sb
@botsy_ I think both of us need to go to sleep
@botsy_ but it's not a bath it's a picture of a bath blended up
if pictures are actually what they depict the world would be different
@botsy_ then you won't be able to see that it's a bath anymore and you're just drinking paper
@botsy_ I thought it was implied
I mean you can't really drink an internet picture unless you drink LCD stuff from your monitor (DO NOT)
@botsy_ no no you have to drink a real bath
@botsy_ here I drew one for you 
@botsy_ why no, benjamin, I don't
maybe we should reenact it to jog my memory
@botsy_ it'll be a good story
"man I'm really warm all of a sudden, maybe I should drink some wat-GOD DAMMIT" - me just now
@botsy_ fight me
@botsy_ exactly
so you could pass out in the bath if you're not careful
but baths are still a good thing
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning you can slip and hit your head while taking a shower
danger is everywhere
@botsy_ THANKS YOU TOO
@botsy_ BENJAMIN
@botsy_ actually I have to leave my glasses on when I'm taking a bath so I don't accidentally fall asleep
it's almost happened before
@botsy_ but probably not a whole bathtub's worth, just thought I'd make that clear
@botsy_ of course
@botsy_ ben I think maybe you should go to sleep
@botsy_ how will you lick your elbow with it if it won't survive
@botsy_ n is also for no survivors didn't you watch the episode
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning I THINK YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE YOUR DEFINITION OF FUN BEFORE YOU ACCIDENTALLY KILL YOURSELF
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning DO NOT CUT OFF YOUR TONGUE BENJAMIN
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning your elbow can't be licked by your own tongue
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning do not blow air into your hoo-hah
you may die
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ I get the feeling those things aren't gonna be enough to kill you through the skin of your hands
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ are you blowing the air into your hoo-hah?!
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning you should actually do it just so you have a story to share about drinking lots of water
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning or like air embolisms because of air being blown into a vagina
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning one time I had to get an ultrasound on my bladder &amp; they had me drink like 1.5 litres &amp; I wasn't allowed to pee :(
@botsy_ you can die from a lot of things that people don't think of, honestly
it's actually kind of scary
@botsy_ it's gonna have a 1 on it and not a 100 and also popular culture has informed me the 100$ bill has benjamin franklin on it
@botsy_ idk I guess it's just something people don't usually experience? it's pretty hard to drink enough to die from it anyway
@botsy_ are you kidding now I can fulfill my dream of being a forest princess
also please don't give me one hundred US dollars
@botsy_ don't give me a hundred bucks
@botsy_ that's a waste of water
someone else could be drinking that water
@botsy_ at least like, take pee breaks ok
@botsy_ there's a difference between drinking a lot of water throughout the day and DRINKING A LITERAL BATHTUB'S WORTH
@botsy_ probably make sure the tub is clean please
also don't give yourself water intoxication
@botsy_ does wanting to drink bathwater mean you're gonna take a bath
@botsy_ YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK BATHWATER
@botsy_ that was pretty deep out of context
@botsy_ sounds like the opposite of a problem to me
remember to stay hydrated.
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ kyg this is becoming the exact opposite of "there's too much water"
@botsy_ drink it
@botsy_ staying hydrated is v important to your health!!!
@GoldfishWarning a greek/roman statue with a championship shit-eating grin
look at this picture of me as a two-year-old
I look like I'm about to beat up some poor nerd 
my parents asking if my sister is back on skype yet is like kids going "ARE WE THERE YET ARE WE THERE YET"
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN SHE'S BACK
@botsy_ that is unfortunate maybe you should drink some water
@botsy_ has your step mom drank enough water
@botsy_ but have the children drank enough water
@botsy_ then g2s
@botsy_ think of the children, benjamin
@botsy_ are the children still s
bc maybe u should g back 2 temporary parenting instead of tweeting at me to g2s before it's even dark out
@botsy_ from the sound of it it is u who should g2s
@botsy_ idk maybe you should drink some water
like in context they're funny but outside of context they're just generally positive things and good advice
my favourite is how lately a lot of my running jokes with people are v positive
like "also I love you" "go to sleep" and drinking water
@botsy_ go to sleep benjamin
@botsy_ maybe you should just watch a movie with them or something, that's p low energy
THIS SPECIFIC SHADE OF BLACK: SULTRY AND FORBIDDING~~~~
DARK RED: MYSTERIOUS, DRAWS US IN!!!
BLUE: EVOKES DIVERSE LOCATIONS SUCH AS OCEANS
there's a page of the newspaper about paint colours and I'm laughing so hard at the descriptions for this year's "in" colours
@botsy_ "sorry children naptime will end tomorrow morning also I'm joining you"
@botsy_ frankly it sounds like you could use a nap too
@botsy_ if you're supposed to be looking after kids shouldn't you be doing that instead of tweeting
@GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock god kyg stop trying to ruin my relationship
@GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock oh good XD that is the reason I'm still using word 2003 lmao
@DecayDJK @TaocHoddock @GoldfishWarning idk I like to keep off the internet if I can when doing homework XD but I'll check that out too
@GoldfishWarning @TaocHoddock guys I'm fine with microsoft word and I barely use excel XD
I'm still using word 2003 because I like it best
@TaocHoddock @GoldfishWarning so I really just need a better program for powerpoints
I'll check out libre for that though, thanks guys :3
@TaocHoddock @GoldfishWarning lmao I actually have MS word and excel on this computer, idk how/why I ended up without powerpoint
"wrestling fans have wrestlemania, football fans have the superbowl, what's your cosplay big event?"
DIDN'T KNOW COSPLAY WAS A CONTACT SPORT
I am not a fan of OpenOffice Impress but I don't have powerpoint on this computer
does anyone have good (free) alternatives?
I'M GOING TO MAKE COOKIES TODAY
that said, I'm actually pretty impressed with the smiley fries
still not as good as just baked, but they didn't taste too bad reheated
homemade poutine tastes a lot better when you don't DROWN it in gravy like I did last night, fyi
got the right amount this time XD
(mostly because there's still leftover fries and gravy in the fridge and apparently curds don't last too long)
guess what's for breakfast
more smiley fry poutine
yessss
cheese curd teeth squeak is like the weirdest sensation tho
wearing those wii fit u socks @MoonMan422 gave me and man I am not used to wearing socks with those lil rubber nipples on the bottom
got a 64% on my second midterm for one of my classes
haha now I feel like shit
"I'll make you eat those curds!" -@MoonMan422
oh my god this is the best thing I've ever done I can't stop fucking laughing 
@KayEffKay idk I feel like it might be hard to mail once prepared, and idk how easy it'd be to portion the mix
@KayEffKay D: I'D REALLY RATHER NOT
why does this poutine gravy mix make ten servings what am I gonna do with all that gravy
I'm so excited for smiley fry poutine
I'm gonna make it tonight
S O O N 
shania twain's "party for two": "you'll be sexy in your socks"
and I thought "man his socks must go really well with his outfit"
it always astonishes me the innocence I had as a child when it comes to songs whose lyrics are clearly about sex
@GoldfishWarning @Dalkalopagus sometimes their clothing is cute
@botsy_ misspelling words of that ilk reminds me of things aimed at children in the 90s
@botsy_ idk who janis joplin is but
we could all use a little change, benji the cosmic lover
my favourite anime are sailor moon, ouran high school host club, and gurren lagann, and I feel this accurately represents my personality
@KayEffKay row row fight the powah!
also had a kickass dream about gurren lagann so now I'm ready to like pilot giant robots and protect humankind and stuff
wish it wasn't such a rare thing that I got as much sleep as I need AND didn't wake up at any point during the night
but I did last night :D
@botsy_ dentist police doot doot
can someone brush my teeth for me I'm too tired to get ready for bed
I like cute things very much
kigurumi canada has ponchos and backpacks in the same design as the owl kigu I have omg
I need the poncho it's so cute I'm gonna cry ;o;
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning include free immunizations with every rusty nail piercing
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ tetanus is my favourite body modification
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning don't forget to poke a bunch of holes in yourself first!!!
(idk if I'll mention I already visited her town in the dream suite lol)
also now I have bells again and I shared some bushes and trees :D
lmao person with the really nice acnl town liked my town, especially my house :D she says she might invite me to her town sometime too :3
@GoldfishWarning what r u talkin bout just stab yourself and pour ink in rite???
when I first got my 3DS I spent a month not realising you had to keep the wireless connection on in order to streetpass anyone
we're discussing the way wikipedia pages on historic events are a microcosm of how history is narrated &amp; transmitted &amp; it's actually so cool
I need to get a rice cooker so I can make rice cooker pancake cakes
MFBTA fashion update: #GREYSWEATSHIRT!!!
guy on the bus has a spiderman toque but was looking down, so for a second I thought he was actually dressed as spiderman
I wanna go to class today cuz I think it's gonna be an interesting class but
I don't wanna GO to class
girls calling boys they're attracted to "daddy" makes me so uncomfortable jfc
I like how the french title for space jam is "basket spatial"
@MinTacoko HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY DARLING &lt;333
@botsy_ I might just spend a day with kyg and/or moon and be like "just visit me over and over and over ok ele needs a cute train station"
@botsy_ lol yeah I think I'm at 19 visitors, so 81 left! it's not exactly the fastest thing to build up
@botsy_ yeah! you get zen, fairytale, and modern options, like the town hall remodels.
the fairytale one looks super cute lmao
@botsy_ on the bright side, it means another visit
if you get 100 visitors (doesn't have to be unique) you get train station remodel pwps!
@botsy_ aw thanks lol
just gotta neaten a few things up I guess, idk if she's just coming to drop things off or if she wants a tour lol
@botsy_ idk I think that's okay too
took me months to even start planning things at all, I just sorta threw down PWPs before that
@botsy_ it's like being visited by a movie star who lives in mansions and blows her nose on hundred dollar bills
@botsy_ and she's coming over just to give me cash, she's loaded and has nothing to use it for, so she offered as reward for bridge testing
@botsy_ lmao I thought yours was fine, plus didn't you only recently pick up the game again?
hers is like SUPER polished lol
I'm p proud of my acnl town around friends but a stranger's visiting tomorrow &amp; her town is SO GOOD &amp; now I'm all "oh no I'm mayor of trash"
like every time they say it I kept mishearing it &amp; it never occurred to me that wasn't quite it til now that I'm watching it with headphones
for literally my whole life I misheard "cornbread &amp; chili" as "corn bran chili" &amp; was SO INTRIGUED by this cereal chili from the parent trap
watching the parent trap again actually makes me so happy
I used to watch this movie like all the time whenever I was home sick
@botsy_ idk I feel like if I had a friendly butler I'd think up a secret handshake with him
@botsy_ somehow it's even more surreal when this happens with adult men and not a pair of young lindsay lohans
this is great
@botsy_ you guys should record yourselves doing it and share it because now I'm actually curious, I've only seen this stuff in movies lol
@botsy_ omg that's actually great then
I think my sister and I tried to make one once but we just ended up slapping each other's hands a lot
I love the lindsay lohan parent trap because like
they're 11-year-old twins, okay
but why are their shared interests poker and fencing
@botsy_ somehow I'm concerned about what it entails
are secret handshakes a thing that really happens in real life
@botsy_ lindsay lohan
you have no idea how upset I was as like an 8 year old when I found out she wasn't really twins
I need to get a DVD of the parent trap
it was one of my fave movies as a kid but I think we still only have it on VHS
I don't know how well it will achieve its end goal but this has to be the best concept for a knitting project

@GoldfishWarning have it drink some water
same 
finally heard iggy azalea rap for the first time
good to know there's someone worse at rapping than noky g stop tbh
@GoldfishWarning killing you guy's delicious judging you chili
@GoldfishWarning keep me updated
also I like how this chili has both boiled violently on you and tried to poison you
@GoldfishWarning oh boy please don't poison yourself
@GoldfishWarning what happened with the beans?!
making food, you guys
@botsy_ well, blue does suit you
@botsy_ but you'd die and then you wouldn't be able to eat more cookies in the future
I wanna rewrite the microwave brownie recipe on my cooking blog and add some pictures but
I haven't made it recently XD
@botsy_ they have butter AND shortening, as well as both brown and white sugar
I'd place bets on what health problem would kill you first
@botsy_ next time you have to bake for like 60 people it's a good choice lol
I think I'll be halving it this time round lmao
@botsy_ (which btw is on my cooking blog and is a fantastic recipe and I recommend it)
I love potato dishes but I hate peeling potatoes
like if there's one thing about cooking I could do without, it's potato peels
@botsy_ I'm using mini plain M&amp;Ms lmao it'll be the same recipe as in my twitter header pic
@botsy_ ...do M&amp;Ms count
oh shit I need to make cookies for my discussion group with mfbta
giving university students cookies is amazing and also I like those people
y'know what I hate? how far away you all are
one of my favourite things in the world is feeding my friends baked goods
y'all are missing out
luckily one of the girls was a friend of nature and knew how to carefully relocate them before we took the tent down lmao
I remember one time in girl guides we were camping &amp; two separate caterpillars started building cocoons on the outside of the tent
I like caterpillars that are fluffy and that is p much the only kind of bug I actively like lol
ok I at least relocated it to where it wouldn't get stepped on. poor thing was moving so slowly, I think it was dying anyway :(
there's a live caterpillar on the ground and like nowhere safe I can move it D:&gt;
@luckyassdummy lol yeah I understand that, I wanna get a job I won't mind having for a while, so I keep only applying to places I'd wanna be
@luckyassdummy I am very used to not having a job and that's the problem XD I really need to get a job this summer lol
also does anyone have like 70$ they're not using because I need this dress

I know breaking open glowsticks isn't wise but
does the liquid dilute or sit on water? cuz if the latter, you could make a universe in a cup
@luckyassdummy haha alright! I'm a little short on cash right now but as soon as I get some dollars I'll try to mail mine for you off
@luckyassdummy it's okay the thing I got for you isn't much either XD
@luckyassdummy lmao I think I still have something I picked up for you too whoops
embarrassing things: choking on water in the middle of an echo-y lecture hall
at least it was during the break so I didn't interrupt lmao
like I have learned some things but the prof just feels very biased and also got us to buy her own textbook, so we have no other opinions
I'm glad this class counts towards my minor but I will also be glad to not be taking it anymore XD aside from today, one class and one exam!
when this documentary switches back to the narrator/host, he's always in some trees or plants
like nestled within the trees, a white guy!
@botsy_ what if people called you banjo
@botsy_ sure thing benji
@botsy_ but he wants you to feel no regrets
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 he wants you to feel no regrets, it's very kind of him
@smileysmile31 @botsy_ seems like an awful waste of time, then
maybe you really should ignore forever, no regrets
@GoldfishWarning lmao take some when it's dry and you're better dressed then XD
@GoldfishWarning take pix!!!
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 then again, exhibiting violence seems an awful waste of energy that could be spent doing better things
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 sounds like a waste of gas and time to me tho, maybe you should wait until he's planning on visiting
@botsy_ @smileysmile31 I have a feeling he knows where you live too tbh
@botsy_ what if you dated someone and they introduced you as "my lover, benji"
@botsy_ ok benji
@botsy_ if you say so, min
"do you feel you're less of a chinese person because you're so fluent in english?" fuck off, old white british guy
this religion class shows so many older documentaries headed by old white british guys, it just feels so biased
@botsy_ sure thing, benny
@botsy_ sorry, jam
@botsy_ happy to inspire, benj
@botsy_ be your own jam
@botsy_ just go around introducing yourself as jam
@botsy_ apparently "nora" is a nickname for eleanor but I don't think you can do much with the end of "benjamin"
@botsy_ what about benny how do you feel about benny
@botsy_ be the first benj
@botsy_ you might end up with some accidental "benji"s
@botsy_ or maybe she'd end up being called "ella" a lot like I get "elle"
@botsy_ she'd probably end up pointing out that people pronounce "bea" as in "beatrice" like "bee" lmao
@botsy_ I wonder how life might be different for elea
@KristaVM that's valid haha, based on that picture alone it looks pretty unappealing to me though
@botsy_ I bet a kid tried to spell my full name like that in early elementary
I swear I dropped and gained vowels all over the place
@KristaVM ugly as fuck imo, not gonna lie
and now almost no one pronounces it right on the first go but "ellie" feels like not my name at all XD
so basically
I spell it "ele" because of bowling
they'd already started calling me "ellie" out loud
so when the scoreboard abbreviated to the first 3 letters of everyone's names, it stuck
aight so waaay back when, @GoldfishWarning turned like 9 or something
and she and I and another girl went bowling for her birthday party
did I ever explain to you guys why I spell it "ele"? I feel like I did but I can't remember
@botsy_ that would explain why all the eleanors I've met are either old or my age lmao
according to some google results I'm from baltimore, had ten kids, and died in 1808
either that or I died last december
@botsy_ I know a lot of younger eleanors go solely by ellie or some variation a lot tho lol
@botsy_ yeah, I've met like maybe four or five personally, they're pretty equally split between our age group and old people XD
apparently eleanor is an old lady name
I don't really care though I think it's a great name
nothing but old or dead ppl come up when I search my full name on google, which either says something about my internet security or my name
LRT: someone buy me this
@KayEffKay lmao I annoy my dogs too sometimes don't worry
griffin I usually only bug when he isn't trying to sleep cuz he's old tho XD
@MinTacoko lol yeah, I hope he doesn't get sick!
@KayEffKay "oh my goood kennedyyy"
@MinTacoko yeah, really, especially with the baby around you'd think they'd wanna make sure to let him know what's up
probably gonna permanently associate timmies french vanillas with this religion class just cuz of how many I've had while in lecture
@MinTacoko yeah, I was about to say, maybe keep him away from the baby until everything's okay :( lil baby immune systems aren't so strong
I love raisins a lot
having an LGBTQ child doesn't mean you did a bad job of parenting
kicking them out of the house/disowning them? fucking does
also ibuprofen can be a bit rough on your liver, if memory recalls, so drink it with lots and lots of water :3
speaking of drinking water, remember to take meds with lots of water because dry swallowing can lead to chemical burns in your throat D:
man I have a bit of a headache
maybe I should drink some water
@GoldfishWarning it's improving the experience of consumerism
there's a dead hornet stuck between the two window layers on this bus and it's equally fascinating and terrifying
@GoldfishWarning because the cold air is freezing the moisture in the clouds into ice crystals
I should really go to the optometrist's b/c I'm overdue for a checkup anyway but things are gonna start being busy soon until like may
NOW I'M UNCOMFORTABLE AND TERRIFIED
(it's probably not, tho, I'm not having any other symptoms and it's not hurting or anything)
there's still a faint tickle in one of my eyes and I managed to scare the shit out of myself in a dream when it turned out to be a parasite
my favourite thing is hearing about people's pets
if you ever need something to talk about with me I will talk about small animals with you
@botsy_ alternatively nestle it in your beard for a selfie
@botsy_ do you still have it
you should frame the cartridge
playing link to the past gba on my fat old 3DS
it's so clunky XD but I think I prefer the feel of the buttons actually
@botsy_ did you buy animorphs
@botsy_ I gotta say, virtual console helps b/c of save states XD I got link's awakening as a club nintendo thing and then bought the others
@botsy_ if you like the sort of top-down zelda games I highly recommend link's awakening and the oracle games, they're actually all so great
@botsy_ I should play that again lol, I haven't since it came out
or y'know actually play link to the past, I've had the gba port for years
@botsy_ which game are you playing right now? :3
@GoldfishWarning I'm so excited to see the finished product
(in the first picture I was trying to take a shot of him sitting up but he decided it was tummy rub time)
you guys diego had a much-needed haircut today and this is the before and after 
BREATHING EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIGHS OF RELIEF
okay I caved in and time traveled ahead to tomorrow to see if I could build the bridge lmao
let's hope this works
@GoldfishWarning tell the nerds to never watch TV or movies again

literally no woman has ever said that
elderly dogs snore weird
@botsy_ GO FOR IT THEN I BELIEVE IN YOUUU
@botsy_ awh, well, it's okay to not be great at it? I mean I like some final fantasy games but I suck at them so I just watch my sister play
@botsy_ dang, well, the only advice I can offer is hoard fairies (or whatever the auto-heal items are in older games) like no tomorrow
@botsy_ probably hit the eye(s)
@botsy_ who are you having trouble with?
can't wait for strawberry season though that is when I feel true happiness
ice cream headache like a cool kid
I am almost certain these strawberries are freezerburned, so it's a good thing the banana hides the taste lmao
zayn's leaving and now "ginger spice" is trending
I can't decide how to feel about this
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ I have faith in zayn malik's face
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ regardless of what happens after that I'm betting he'll still be handsome for another decade at least
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning I feel like it's unlikely he'll follow the same aging pattern as a white guy who smokes
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning most people tend not to though
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ what if it snowed in san francisco
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ he's only like a year older than me so by the time he's a wrinkly old man I'll probs be a wrinkly old woman anyway
@GoldfishWarning everything will be okay because somewhere there's a hot guy
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning yeah but there won't be NEW pictures
@GoldfishWarning there should have been a comma there
his goal for leaving wasn't because he wanted to stop being publicly handsome
@GoldfishWarning yeah but from what I could gather his aim is to step out of the public eye so he won't be handsome in front of everyone
tbh I'm kind of disappointed about zayn leaving 1D b/c he's handsome as fuck
I JUST FOUND A BAG OF FROZEN STRAWBERRIES FROM LAST SUMMER IN THE FREEZER
we have bananas
I'm going to have a smoothie ;w;
I support lowering tuition fees in general but these referendums are all
"better health services, 15$/semester hike?"
sounds good to me tbh
if it doesn't work I'll either have to deal with a really inconvenient town layout or force diva to move and either option kinda sucks
there's literally no reason it shouldn't work if my results from all the bridge testing are correct but like
wehhh
okay in acnl I demolished the cobblestone bridge I'm worried about replacing, so I can replace it with the wooden one
pray 4 me u guys
@botsy_ 
@botsy_ ben the knuckle whisperer
trimmed my hair again lol
did a p alright job this time 'round but like always it'll probably look better after a week or two
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning how do you know
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning actually I used some lotion to moisturize it
so technically I did give it a drink
@GoldfishWarning she had said "you're still wearing that sweater?" re: the big pink flowery 90's one
she replied "no, I love it!"
accidentally said "wanna fight about it" instead of "why do you ask" to my mother whoops
@GoldfishWarning thanks I did
why is my knuckle so itchy
mid 20th c instructions for how to be a "good wife" are painful jfc
american history prof is talking about feminism (specifically 1st &amp; 2nd wave)
please do this well I believe in you
"we're reincarnated space warriors? AH YES I REMEMBER OUR OLD LIVES NOW WE ARE SUPER MATURE" 
it's so much less relatable
also I haven't watched the latest episodes but all the characters feel like they have less personality as teenage girls too
sailor moon crystal's colour palette is beautiful but honestly its animation is so much less expressive than the original show
I wanted to spend tomorrow in PJs but I gotta take diego to the groomers
he needs it tho he's actually a pompom loaf w/ legs rn
the lady said only touch the middle of their backs but the rays kept tilting so they'd essentially high-five me :D
I love ocean creatures :3
and you put your hand in, flat, and the lil sharks and rays would swim under your hand! it was so amazing
when I was in boston we went to the new england aquarium and they had a petting tank for little tiny sharks and rays!!! it was big &amp; shallow
@GoldfishWarning beautiful scorpion still got nothin' on jellyfish fight me
I like jellyfish because even though they can hurt you they're very pretty
scorpions could learn something from jellyfish
how do people live without fear in more southern regions with scary-ass bugs and scorpions and shit
I would cry
holy shit

@GoldfishWarning it was sunny so he decided it was a good corner to be in
but I didn't notice him at first and it was like SURPRISE lil dog
@GoldfishWarning mind you I gotta post the pics of deej in my bathroom when the door was mostly open &amp; he was tucked b/w the door &amp; the tub
@GoldfishWarning meanwhile it takes trickery, speed, &amp; possibly a fair amount of dog wrestling to get a good shot of deej unless he's asleep
by the end of the evening he was bitching about rules b/c employees kept us in line til the theatre was cleaned so
not a great guy lol
like
?????!?
did you like
miss the part
where I am presenting as female
that was ok but a little awkward but at 1 pt he mentioned angelina jolie having marriage trouble
he went "ah, women, they're so crazy, huh?"
when I was waiting in line to see the third hobbit on opening day
the only other guy there at first kept trying to talk to me and like
timmies french vanilla with caramel flavour shot:
really good! really decadent tho lol, I think I still prefer the mint shot
I love it when ppl take pics of something &amp; a cat is just lounging beside that thing
do you know how hard it is to get a good pic w/ my dogs
@botsy_ but how many bens could there be
@botsy_ classic ben
like chips or something
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning bath ben???
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ meth ban
@botsy_ what did poor math ben ever do to you
also if he's math ben what ben are you
and is that other guy tattoo ben
@botsy_ if that's the case you can be assured the beard would still be there
@botsy_ he was probably like a business student or something, those kids always dress up so fancy just for class
@botsy_ I didn't see his arms, he had a blazer or something on lmao
his beard was longer, it was like glimpsing into the future
"you cannot tell me My Heart Will Go On is not a good song" -one of my classmates
@codingcranium Magical Forest Boy TA, my TA for one of my history classes
he looks like he could be like an elf or fairy folk or something
we're discussing fedoras
apparently MFBTA owns a fedora but it was only for a hallowe'en costume
MFBTA update: dressing like a trucker
also he threw up this morning apparently lmao that was important to know
s2g @botsy_'s grumpier-looking doppelganger is on this bus, this is so bizarre
and then I started to get worried at the amount of responsibility taking care of goldfish would be, like I don't already take care of dogs
had a dream where I found 2 goldfish in a tiny cup of water &amp; I thought 1 was dead &amp; 1 was dying but both were okay once I put 'em in a tank
@botsy_ my mom likes speakers while my dad likes headphones so I am way more familiar with my mom's taste lol
@botsy_ that is true! and I know my mom (maybe my dad? idk) listens to at least some of the same music, just in digital formats now XD
@botsy_ but I also think you'd get along with my mom, based solely on music lmao
and that's not a bad thing my mom's pretty cool
@botsy_ well my parents haven't really bought vinyl in decades so maybe their CDs would paint a more accurate picture of who they are now
@botsy_ omg I know right
it's super nostalgic for me so I still love it but it's just like /what/
@botsy_ it's just that idk exactly what's in my parents' record collection, and what of that I'd recognise, but I know there's beatles
@botsy_ I grew up watching yellow submarine and listening to the soundtrack and I still don't, so I'm probably fine XD
@botsy_ I'm trying to imagine what a vinyl-playing equivalent of a discman would look like lol
"no what that's not my backpack it's my ipod"
@botsy_ lmao I should get my mom to haul out her record player, see what all the fuss is about
listen to some
beatles I guess
@GoldfishWarning title reminded me of that shania twain song so I found it &amp; was greeted by the most awkward band

@botsy_ I guess I never really had much exposure to records tbh
I place a lot of value in portability of music so CD &amp; mp3 are more my thing
I have these glow-in-the-dark nail polishes and one time I spent hours painting my toes like nebulas and it was SO COOL but so much work lol
@botsy_ but like, what's the appeal of it? I just never really understood that part
and yeah paying more for older tech is silly lol
@GoldfishWarning but it wears out eventually
I'm all for philosophical stuff but if I'm gonna buy music I want it in the most durable form
I kind of want to make gaudy jewelery with these glow-in-the-dark stars
looks chunky and weird in the light
SPACE PRINCESS IN THE DARK
@botsy_ good you got it
(I actually usually eat leftovers from dinner for breakfast I lied)
@botsy_ pshht I eat pain for breakfast
I honestly don't see the appeal of modern bands releasing music on vinyl tho like why bother
it'd be like releasing shit on VHS
@GoldfishWarning DDD:&gt;
@botsy_ but they look like fun :(
I have never been on a slip 'n' slide you guys :(
so I got this package of glow-in-the-dark stars b/c I'm an 8-year-old and like, this blurb
"The fun is unlimited." 
let it be known that I am not a fit person and as such, public transit needs to operate on schedule holy fucking shit my lungs
@botsy_ (out of all the weird shit I've eaten this is the one that keeps getting brought up over and over jfc)
@botsy_ ICE CREAM AND MAYONNAISE BENJAMIN
IF I'M AT FAULT FOR THIS YOU'RE AT FAULT FOR THAT
also the book claims that justinian's head detaches from his body, disappears, and floats around the palace like a demon
okay buddy
this guy procopius wrote a book damning emperor justinian
one chapter is called "How Justinian Killed A Trillion people"
@botsy_ NUH UH
you were the one who first joked that your knuckle wouldn't drink the water
so I am at least half right!!!!!!
@botsy_ NUH UH
you were the one who decided your knuckle needs to drink the water
and I was poking fun at your phrasing re: dates
so NUH UH
@botsy_ I DIDN'T THOUGH
@botsy_ how do you know it wants water or a date, then
@botsy_ maybe you should ask it what it wants
@botsy_ what kinds of significant others is your knuckle into
@botsy_ are you trying to set your knuckle up on a date
@botsy_ put some ice on it
the ice will melt into water
basically just stay hydrated
@botsy_ disappointing
also staying hydrated can help with a lot of minor health things
and if your knuckle hurts maybe it's bruised so ice
@botsy_ is this a chemistry pun
YOOO I get easter monday off for the sole reason that the university gave roman history class 13 weeks for a 12 week course!!!
@botsy_ exactly
now shut up and drink some water
and probably put some ice or something on that knuckle
@botsy_ 
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning are you doubting my ability to respond using pop music from over a decade ago
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ ^ she beat me to it
@botsy_ maybe I should just be the hydration police
@botsy_ instead of doot doot the pee police cars just make obnoxious splashing noises to get people to relieve themselves
@botsy_ the peelice
no nvm that looks like pee lice and I want nothing to do with that
@botsy_ please go to the bathroom if you feel like this
@botsy_ idk man maybe you should drink some more water anyway
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning are you sure you're quenched enough
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning it's good for the rest of your body too
hydration is very important
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning BEN I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU
YOUR BODY PARTS
ARE ALL CONNECTED
@GoldfishWarning at first I mistook super bass for all about that bass and was like
harvey nooo
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning never said your knuckle should drink the water, just you and knuckles
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ this is how I fix every health problem
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning yes of course
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ you guys both need to drink some water I think
currently I am fretting about fake hair b/c buying wigs is a thing
how are you, twitter?
:O today is national puppy day??? omggg
things I definitely don't regret: downloading the We Love Katamari soundtrack
there are so many jokes to be made here WHERE DO I EVEN START 
maybe sometime I will challenge myself by tweeting only in french for a day, using google translate only to confirm and not to compose
and if you got it wrong it did like this weird amusement park spinning thing to reset all the buttons so you could try again
and you had to press the right colour buttons in the right order to START the bus, &amp; then press the right combo to go where you wanted to go
had a dream last night I had to take the most inefficient bus to school
it was automated and there was a wall covered in buttons
a few days ago walking into my room from the hallway was like walking into a weak sauna why is it so cold in here all of a sudden D:
@botsy_ I guess so, just be careful please
maybe it was a bad idea to post without that context, then
sorry for poopin' on your party lol
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey like I really don't mean to be a jerk about this it's just
be careful about what you joke about I guess is all
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey yeah, and I'm aware of that, but like
why make the joke at all then, if you don't think it's okay to joke about
@botsy_ dammit
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey you don't know who's listening and who's actually taking it seriously so it's v important to avoid that sorta thing
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey someone else listening thinks in the back of their mind "ah yes this is an acceptable thing for me to actually do"
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey yeah, I get that, just be careful
like if someone tells a joke about a topic like this but doesn't mean it, but then
@botsy_ good that means I don't have to eat weird shit to gross you out anymore
@botsy_ mayo and ice cream vs. the word "lover"
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey like you guys are all p rad and I know that but 
little things like jokes give permission for bigger things
@botsy_ @Timmy_Horsey I'm glad &amp; like
I don't wanna sound like a party pooper or bossy boots but
be careful about being a bystander too lol
@Timmy_Horsey @botsy_ I was hoping "wife" was the correct answer so I wouldn't have to scowl at you guys for joking about spousal abuse &gt;:(
I need to buy a fancy prom dress just to put on when I'm in need of a mood boost tbh
nothing happier than twirling around in a fancy dress
I think vatican city should participate in eurovision
I think moles &amp; lil skin marks are actually really cool &amp; cute tbh
I have a tiny birthmark on my arm shaped like a capital "E" it's so great
"#NotAllNuns2015" -@frumpystiltskin
lmao I just remembered the time @GoldfishWarning's dad wanted to make a scary hallowe'en pumpkin so he carved the Fox News logo onto it
so my existence partially depended on a coin flip and I just think that's super whoa
so when my great aunt invited her to stay for dinner
she went to her room
and flipped a coin to decide between staying or going out
and one evening he invited opa over for supper
but oma had made plans with some of her friends to go see a movie or something
my oma was living with her sister and brother-in-law, my great aunt and uncle
my great uncle actually worked with my opa
guys I wanna tell you the story of how my grandparents met okay
so they're both german, came to canada separately after WWII and met here
I want to make my own unagi udon but idk if the local grocery store sells udon noodles and I'm p sure they don't sell eel lmao
hey @MinTacoko clean out your bathroom closet 
also hello my name's eleanor and I've played animal crossing for almost two and a half hours over the course of today
god I'm such a huge weenie abt replacing this bridge in acnl
spent like 300 000 bells over 2 weeks to confirm it'd work &amp; I'm still paranoid
I need a bookshelf for my textbooks ;-;
the bookshelves in my room are already covered with stuffed toys and/or manga
I think I'm gonna start cleaning my room to procrastinate vacuuming
then it'll be a doubly-productive day eventually
I've p much decided that I'm gonna let julian stay and treat him like any other villager until he asks to leave, I'm not gonna force him
also every time I see kidd now I think "GOSH WHAT A CUTIE" so maybe I'll trade julian for him when julian decides to go
using the dream suite a lot and all I can think is that line from sonic adventure
I WAS ON A SNOOZE CRUISE I GUESS
@Dalkalopagus happy birthday, congrats on making it around the sun again!!! I hope your birthday is full of grand adventures :D
clickbait more like clickgoddammit why did I like all these pages when I was 16
me re: whistling

not having homework is good but it's also like "ok now what do I do with my evenings"
what movie should I watch, twitter?
the only reason anyone needs in order to visit canada is poutine tbh
I should just get rich and hire a chauffeur of course
man it's like
I wanna know how to drive
but I don't wanna have to learn and do the tests lmao
something inside my eye keeps giving me a tickly pulsing feeling every so often lately
it's freakin' me out man
zac efron is my new favourite disney princess

@Dalkalopagus I have a compilation CD of music from 1998 from the dollar store with bands such as "Backerstreet" and "Salt 'n Water" (Aqua)
PANCAKES FOR DINNER YESSS
just a reminder that there is a cute game in which you are a giraffe and all the giraffes are lining up to kiss you

my mom still loves banana phone
@botsy_ benjamin subway guy genealogist the potatoes
@botsy_ are you potatoes all the time then
@botsy_ do you cook your potatoes in soap???
@botsy_ that's why you use bubble bath and stuff! so you can be not potatoes!
now it's like "the bathwater is bright orange and smells like oranges, there is a foot of bubbles, and I am NOT A POTATO"
honestly I don't know how I took baths before using fancy shit in them
like 
I'd just sit in a tub full of hot water
like potatoes
just had a bath yesss
trying remedies from the internet for minor health things is always like "GOSH GOLLY I HOPE THIS DOESN'T KILL ME DEAD"
@GoldfishWarning ah, yeah then I did it right XD 19cm, 20 if I hurt myself stretching lmao
@GoldfishWarning I'm not sure how exactly you're measuring that cuz if I interpreted it right, mine's only barely 19cm?
ok I better get a 5/5 on this final quiz because my answers were super long and precise and I need to make up for that 3.5/5 on the last one
why am I so cold this should be illegal
the good thing is I no longer dress like hot topic and value village's frumpy weeaboo lovechild
and now it's making me think about everything about myself and my life that's changed over the past five years
man I think a lot now about the FB event "I'll get an event notification in 5 years &amp; be like whats this?"
cuz that totally happened
ele's gettin' real analytical about chick flicks because right now I don't have the brainpower for much else than what I just watched
I mean I recognise that I'm probably not the target age but like
idk it just feels like a tired and shallow trope
y'know what movie I like? legally blonde
b/c you can be popular and confident and girly without being nasty and manipulative jus sayin
okay I finished watching the bratz movie
it felt like a less exciting high school musical tbh
so like
I'm blonde
why didn't I get to carry a dog around in high school
I have honestly never been in a food fight
I'm not sure I'd want to tho cuz like why throw food when you could eat it
frankly I'm under the impression american high schools are 800 times more exciting than canadian ones just because of movies
alright bratz time
also if you've never done it before try playing acnl with headphones cuz there's actually so many details the speakers barely play
the town I visited through the dream suite today had bubblegum k.k. playing through a TV and I need to know how
@botsy_ we should go rave with @GoldfishWarning or something next time!
@botsy_ shit I forgot to add you to my best friends list lmao
oh well next time I guess
@botsy_ okay I'm ready! lemme know when your gates are open!
also do you need a silver slingshot? literally just got one right now
@botsy_ sounds cool
I will also bring some perfect apples so you can make big buxx
@botsy_ lmao that's fine
are you still missing any fruit because I can bring you so much fruit
@botsy_ lmao gimme a few minutes, I'm using the dream suite rn
do you wanna visit me, or have me over?
btw I have no more homework for a while so if I bought a toy hammer for you in ACNL, gimme a shout when you've got time to get it!!!
might watch the bratz live action movie tonight
I won't annoy y'all with livetweeting the whole thing but I may tweet about it now and then
does anyone use google plus for social media because I honestly haven't heard of anyone really using it much
why does facebook still have that poke function
@botsy_ are you gonna be ok ben
@botsy_ me too? he is a mystery
wat

my mom took me and my dad to a toy store after dinner and they had a paint by numbers of The Last Supper
?????????
@botsy_ the newspapers will love it
@GoldfishWarning that's the plan lol
I'm sure he was smiling at smthng on his phone but it looks like this guy on the bus took an apple from his bag &amp; smiled at it fondly
just misread "direct dial buttons" for bus services on this payphone as "direct dial burritos"
magical forest boy TA update: he likes titanic apparently
omg omg we are actually discussing Titanic fanfiction as a product of historical movies
this movie poster for Titanic looks like they're giants riding in this little wee boat

don't get me wrong I love the character so I'm super glad he'll survive but at the same time it's like "good social media marketing guys"
love how The Flash show killed a character this week and then posted on FB "Looks like he's getting a love interest!!!"
way to keep suspense
I am gonna miss tweeting about mfbta after this semester lmao
magical forest boy TA is wearing a white polo shirt with abstract flowery prints on it, he looks more magical and foresty today

can't believe it's almost summer, I'm done in a lil over a month
I'll have to remember to leave the house so I don't become a listless blob
I'm not denying that it's pretty cool, like I fuckin' love space and eclipses are super cool, it's just funny when you think about it
I remember a few years back there was a venetian eclipse
so a classmate handed out some eclipse glasses &amp; we saw a speck in front of the sun
I love how exciting eclipses are tho cuz it's like "things in space are LINING UP AND THAT DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN!!!"

maybe next week if the weather holds XD
and no that wasn't a typo the packaging for my space tights literally says "Galazy Leggings"
today's gonna go above freezing! IT'S GALAZY TIGHTS TIME
once I had a dream where speed dial 8 on my cell was "Sports"
so irl I made speed dial 8 call Sports (really just @GoldfishWarning's number)
after a while I got fed up I think
like "IS IT GOOD ENOUGH YET"
I can't even remember most of the chunks of dream adventures themselves
my dream last night involved @botsy_ critiquing my dreams
there'd be a chunk of weird dream &amp;he'd be all "no no needs more action" or smthng
can't tell if my nails are too long or just right
I don't usually let them get very long but I also like having them this long XD
as of this evening the itunes playcount on why not by hilary duff is exactly 100 (I've probs listened to it on my ipod a few more times tho)
@botsy_ I saw his face and I am not a believer
@botsy_ I don't believe you
@botsy_ he doesn't look like guy fieri
how many tweets has eleanor made?
it's OVER NINE THOUSAaaaaaanever mind I'm sorry.
@botsy_ see, I have no doubts that you are guy fieri, but I don't think the guy on the beard blog is! so who could he be
@botsy_ idk something seems fishy to me
and not in a slam-dunk salmon burger kind of way
@botsy_ what happened to your bleached beard and hair
and how does it come back when you turn on your facecam while streaming
I'M ONTO YOU
@botsy_ yeah that is definitely true
it's a pretty subtle difference anyway
@botsy_ then who's the guy on your beard blog
@botsy_ ew imgur turned it into a jpg
oh well it's not like the rest of us would see things totally perfectly through hitbox anyway XD
now @botsy_ can stop using that fucking discomforting picture of guy fieri
this is a good reward for my work
@botsy_ sure can! how's this

@botsy_ of course! my goal was to capture the essence of your streams and animorphs is a crucial part of them
@botsy_ p.s. I listened to nothing but hilary duff while making this
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ he asked for that caption lmao
@botsy_ (I can send it to you if twitter's having trouble showing you the full size)
HEY @BOTSY_ I MADE YOU A THING
literally anything you're not ok with can be changed
I have like a million fonts too

yeah it was a religious war! we were FIGHTING FOR THE FAITH OF CHEESE
I think no one even really knew what "army" they were in except us, we just kind of told them as it went
and it happened recess after recess for like probably a good week, us trying to """convert""" (tag) people on the other teams to our side
there were three teams, Cheese (us), Gravy, and Pickles. and no one really knew the rules except Cheese. and we made it up as we went.
the thing is, she and I and our friends were the only people really caring about this game of tag. others sort of half-heartedly played.
I can't remember exactly how. but somehow things in grade 5 devolved into a bizarre game of tag involving a large number of our grade.
so she and I and a few other of our friends decided long ago that cheese was THE BEST. we were the kind of kids to shout "I LIKE CHEESE."
hey guys guess what time it is
it's story time
today's story brings us back to my and @GoldfishWarning's fifth grade adventures

@botsy_ even so! shit costs dollars
mind you my sister bought me a 30$ ukulele
it stayed in tune for approximately five minutes
@botsy_ instruments are very expensive!!!
@smileysmile31 those are still large amounts of money! like man when I buy a 40$ video game I consider it splurging lmao

@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ you guys should do this again sometime tho for real
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning and at one point he wanted to play us all star on guitar but couldn't do it cuz he'd had some alcohol

@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning lol I just remembered the time jared had too many drinks to achieve the motor control to play all star for us so
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning imagine what you could achieve while drunk
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ well I mean you can but I'm still without musical skill XD I could...sing badly I guess?
@GoldfishWarning @botsy_ my fave part is unlike the "bands" &amp; songs we made up as kids, they actually know how to play enough instruments
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning true I mean I found it by myself XD
@botsy_ @GoldfishWarning yeah I mean I'd rather not embarrass anyone without permission lmao

I love knowing someone responded to my tweets by the faint noise of my phone buzzing from across the room
like "AH YES, SOMEONE BECKONS"
@botsy_ guess he wanted to stop listening to people's farts
@botsy_ I feel like god might be more at fault for the capability to fart than the mute button, unless microphones were divinely inspired
@botsy_ MAYBE GO TO THE BATHROOM FIRST THEN
@botsy_ try "fratristream"
@GoldfishWarning I'd probably start a grease fire by accident
