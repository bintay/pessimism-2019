So who wants to get food with me tomorrow after work?
Let's see if today turns out just as shitty as yesterday.
My mom is giving me a head rub to help with my headache and its on point <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª
Lol I really fucking can't <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Wooooooooow
When somebody pisses me off I get a headache. Which means today has been one nonstop headache.
@betty_jo13 people just have been pissing me off non stop today
@betty_jo13 yeah lol
Obviously fucking not.
Did it ever click that maybe that's the fucking reason I can't stand your presence.
Yup that's it. Run away like you always fucking do.
No tolerance for your shit. Or any shit. Nope. None.
Worst fucking day. Can't fucking handle this shit.
I'm going to fucking flip a shit.
I'm so tired <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@betty_jo13 I'm not ready for storms yet <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Who wants to cuddle with me tonight when it starts storming?
One thing can change your feelings for someone.
Lost a lot of points there buddy.
<POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE>
Really really fucking hate people.
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
Hey would you look at that. I actually learned how to sleep at night <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
I came in my room to get ready for bed. And what am I doing? Sitting on my floor looking on Twitter
I wanna go spelunking. Someone take me spelunking plz
Like my life isn't already complicated enough. Let's just add some more shit into the mix.
I'd love to sleep but we all know that's not happening so why even try?
So I'm home now and everybody else is asleep. What to do...what to do....?
Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one
So put it on me
Yes yes yes <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
Well turned that hour drive into a 40 minute one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't even know what I do wrong half the time.....
Does that make me a dork?
I'm watching a show about how a treadmill is made and I'm actually kinda enjoying it
Gave you my heart but you took my soul
Now it's just a waiting game.
I would post more with my dog but she can never take a picture with me without looking like a spaz
I just realized I post way too many pictures of my cat on Instagram
I just want to be able to sleep in past 8 o'clock
I used to think girls who ran back to boys that destroyed them were stupid and I couldn't understand why they would do that. Now I do.
Reasons I can't sleep: 
1. It's hot as balls 
2. My brain hates me 
3. You. 
4. It's hot as balls.
I just need to know if there is a chance. Even just a tiny one.
Oh my gosh it's only 9. Kms. <UNAMUSED FACE><PISTOL>
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
I think I'll find things to do at work tonight to postpone going home.
One party down, one to go. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I have way too much fun picking the color schemes for parties at work
I'll probably just go to the park after work today and walk on the trails alone for two hours like I did yesterday.
I'm not in the mood for today. At all. None of it. Nope.
You know how earlier I said I was starting to feel happy again? Yeah well that only lasted that one day.
Not in the mood to be single tonight, tbh
Secluding myself in my room and watching movies all night because why not.
Sometimes quiet is violent. 
My head is going to explode.
Can't do this. Can't do this. Can't can't can't.
Maybe I'm just not good enough.
Sitting in my car jamming to music cause nobody is home and there is shit on tv
Just kidding it makes me wanna stab myself in the eye with a fork.
My favorite thing is to be ignored.
@Britney_Lane221 knowing me I'd be sleeping by then <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Someone please give me plans tonight.
So we're starting this again? I thought things were different this time. But I guess they never will be. <UNAMUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
You can never say never
While we don't know when
Time, time, time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
@betty_jo13 I wish I was that smart lol
@betty_jo13 I tried to lay on on Monday but fell asleep laying on my stomach and my back and legs are so red <FLUSHED FACE>

me: 
I'm just trying to be your friend. Honestly nothing more. Just friends.
I don't think Garrett and I have gone to eat someplace other than Steak n Shake and Chilis
It's been real yo <VICTORY HAND>üèªÔ∏è
Ayeee I'm done with the school <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
Text me. Call me. Talk to me. Do something.
This is something I haven't felt in a long long time. I've missed it
I'm actually starting to feel happy again <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My burn is giving me goosebumps. This is an issue
What I do during finals week <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è<BIKINI> 
So I'm just going to sit here with my mtn dew and drink all of the calories that I just burned <OK HAND SIGN>üèª
I feel so good after that run. However, my knee isn't too happy about it.
Hopeful and optimistic <VICTORY HAND>üèªÔ∏è
Honestly, after everything that happened I'm not mad. I don't hate you. I forgive you. I just want to try again.
It won't stop.
When someone refers to your ex boyfriend as your current boyfriend b/c they don't know you broke up and your heart breaks all over again<PERSEVERING FACE>
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you
It's okay to miss someone <PENSIVE FACE>
All I could think about was how much I wanted to be there with you.
Jk it kinda pisses me off a lot
So I guess my foot isn't ever going to heal. Which is cool <VICTORY HAND>üèªÔ∏è
B/c cats <CAT> 
More reason to love him <HEART WITH ARROW> 
@Britney_Lane221 it's a little too late lol
Is it too late to back out <FLUSHED FACE>
I kinda don't want to do this thing tonight. Why did I agree to it?
I have an interesting group of emotions right now.
Hawaiian theme at work next week Lets Gooooo <OK HAND SIGN>üèª 
What b√¶?¬ø <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
I'm so over this whole randomly crying while I'm in the car by myself shit. It can stop anytime now. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I wish my wish was enough.
I need to go to the Wrecking Room ASAP
Me looking at my life* 
I just don't...I don't understand. Why would you miss someone like that instead of missing me...? It hurts.
Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck uuugggghhhh
Not that I have a b√¶. I just like it because of Pikachu <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è 
What are you waiting for?
When nobody is home I like to park like a jackass in my driveway
@emileelovesyou7 I haven't been there in forever! That'd be the perfect date <BLUE HEART>
@emileelovesyou7 yes! I've been wanting to go since like January!
I really want to go to the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and then go to the Cheesecake Factory
Only having my cat to cuddle with is getting very old...<FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
My new thing is to tell Siri all my problems and how I'm feeling instead of talking to an actual person
I am becoming very good at ignoring people when they text me.
It's Disney theme at work all this week. My dream has come true
I hate this car that I'm driving. There's no hiding for me. I'm forced to deal with what I feel. I could pull the steering wheel.
It's amazing how you can attach so many memories and emotions to one particular song.
anxiety: im glad you asked
Shutting down. No more feelings. Nobody else. It's just easier this way.
Sometimes it helps just talking to a random stranger about your life.
1:25 AM. Finished my paper <FISTED HAND SIGN>üèª
12:55 AM. Still writing my paper.
I wish I was they type of person who could not care about anything. Not over think everything. Just get up and walk away. And let go.
Sometimes I wish there was a life manual to help me decide what I should do.
And I would not wish it upon anyone. Even if they were the one who did it to me.
Being completely destroyed and beaten down by someone is the worst possible thing that can happen to a person
@betty_jo13 I forgive you
@betty_jo13 it's because you're private <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@betty_jo13 I just want to retweet this <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I think not trying is the best thing I can do right now. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Why the fuck do I have cramps?! I literally can't move right now
I honestly don't know how I feel. And I don't know what to do.
My new favorite thing is to shut down and become antisocial around large groups of people.
This is pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.
@_TheScooter_ definitely! text me sometime haha 718-7272 <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I like how @_TheScooter_ favorites and retweets my tweets but we like never talk even tho we used to be tight way back when lol
I am so confused right now
Toy Story <GREEN HEART>
I don't know how I feel about this yet....
<WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE> 
My new favorite thing to do is third wheel it with Adrian and his girlfriend <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
So annoyed right now
Bed at 10 on a Friday cause I got no friends
Perks of having long dark hair: you can hide ear buds in your hair during class so your professor can't tell you watching Netflix <THUMBS UP SIGN>üèª
I get to dress like a bum at work this whole week and I'm so happy about it
Good news: my foot doesn't hurt anymore. Bad news: I messed my knee up and can't walk again.
If someone's broken, they stay broken. No matter what.
I keep listening to my chest. For a beat but there's nothing left.

I want shawarma!....what is shawarma..?¬ø 
You guys should be jealous because I made a killer dinner tonight
Regretting this decision <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
I'm really not a happy camper right now
I did not agree to this.
Watching Netflix while running was the best decision I've ever made
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've gotten all my homework done the night before it's due #notaprocrastinatortonight
Honestly just text me so we can talk about things. Please.
And the worst thing is people are believing the shit you're saying. Which is really really not okay
You don't even know me. Why are you trying to turn my life into a living hell?
This is a perfect example of me not having any real friends.
Well that was a waste of my fucking time. So pissed right now. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
I'm just so afraid I'll never be the same again. <PENSIVE FACE>
Me with fucking everything.  
Really tho  
So my dog did very well on her walk. However, my hand is throbbing from holding her leash
I really hope she doesn't pull on the leash. My hands hurt too much I wouldn't be able to hold on lol
Taking my dog on a run with me. This should be interesting to say the least <RUNNER>üèª<PAW PRINTS>
I really really did them good this time.
At this point in my life* 
When you bruise your hand from punching things and you have to bowl in a tournament this weekend <UNAMUSED FACE><POUTING FACE><PISTOL>
I'm done getting close to people because it always ends in disaster anyway. It's not worth the pain.
What did I ever do to deserve this.
I didn't even do anything this time. Why does this keep happening to me. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>

me (two days later): wait nevermind haha nope
You literally can't trust anybody anymore. I'm never making that mistake again.
It's so ridiculous when people butt into other people's lives when it's not their fucking business and they have no idea what's going on
Literally my life is falling apart and I can't deal with it.
If I find out who said this, you better hope I never see you in person.
I don't think I've ever been this angry. It's really really hard to keep my cool in class right now
I really don't understand. I'm confused and pissed off right now. Who would say something like that? And more importantly, why?
I really just wish it was summer again. I don't think I've ever been happier than I was last summer and I want that again so fucking much <SLEEPY FACE>
Literally me  
Honestly, I can't say I'm happy anymore. I'm either upset, angry, or just kinda here doing life.
@LynnetteSeebach aw really? Poopy oh well I'll stop by anyway
Throwback to when I feel in love <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SPARKLING HEART><MOUNT FUJI><REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER D + REG>üá¶üáπ #Germany2k14 
I just wanted to let @LynnetteSeebach know that I may be paying her a visit tomorrow at work. To get a slushie and bowl some too
Sometimes things you think are "better" really aren't any better. And you learn that soon enough
Yes there is always going to be someone better. But why leave what you have with someone just because of a fleeting thought
Gloria is salty 
According to my psychology, I'm clinically depressed. I wonder why that is. <UNAMUSED FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
Oh shit it was two months yesterday and I didn't even realize it lol maybe that's a good thing
Don‚Äôt get too close
It‚Äôs dark inside
It‚Äôs where my demons hide

Today was interesting to say the least
Alone again.
It's for the best to keep our distance.
Just when I thought everything was okay...
Literally impossible to study in my house <UNAMUSED FACE>
@LynnetteSeebach if only I could retweet this <PERSEVERING FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
Well that's another person gone. Let's see how many more relationships I can screw up. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><PISTOL>
Way to go, Krystal. Way to fucking go. <CRYING FACE><PISTOL>
Why do I always do the wrong things. Say the wrong things.
When I say I screw everything up, it's not an exaggeration. I literally screw every damn thing up.
I feel like the reason I'll be sore tomorrow is not b/c  I jumped on trampolines for 2 hrs but b/c Adrian checked me mid air and fell on me
I feel like a trampoline park is Adrian's natural habitat. He's so graceful and at home there
My dog has bad judgement of character. My cat, however, is on point.
The news is taking about tornadoes. I'm not prepared for this yet <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

Why do I feel so sick <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Like it literally just disappeared one day
I really wish I knew what happened to my rear windshield wiper. I hate driving around in the rain with rain drops on my back window
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
I don't understand how Garrett puts up with my sass but I'm thankful for it <BLUE HEART>
Am I the only one who has these weird emojis by people's names on snapchat...? I am thoroughly confused 
Maybe we can bond over having no soul! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
When you have a crush on a random ginger in chem class but you're not sure how to approach him
I look super cute today. I'm so proud

@A_Pupino you're the best
Night #2 of me surrounding myself with blankets so it feels like I'm cuddling with my ex-boyfriend
@A_Pupino you're fantastic <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@A_Pupino omg I love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
But since that's probably never happening again, I have made my blanket my cuddle buddy
All I wanna do at this moment is cuddle with my ex-boyfriend and watch a movie
someone: I like you
me: thanks
me: no one likes me
Found a 1970 Mustang GT fastback and I'm literally crying because I can't have it <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

And yeah I'm that girl at the current moment. And I'm fed up with it.
Because that's bullshit and you're bullshit for being fake
If you can't talk to a girl in front of your parents or in front of your girlfriend, then you shouldn't talk to her at all.

There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel
Been stuck in my head for the past two weeks so I thought I'd share it with the world 
Second chances are things that only happen in movies.
Driving myself insane has become a regular thing for me nowadays.
Because I don't know who I am anymore. And I don't know what to do. I'm just so confused.
@betty_jo13 I have some of those too!!

Starting to think I should just stop trying to talk to people and be friends with them because I always get the short end of the stick.
Not a happy camper right now.
Same shit just a different person.
Someone in my chem class smells like wet dog and I'm not sure how I feel about it.
Good thing I'm doing a party at work tomorrow. I'm running out of cash <BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN>
I thought we were past the point of ignoring each other but I guess not. So that's cool and whatnot.
The fact Celin Dion came on the radio while I'm in the Steak n Shake bathroom makes me happy

But my hair looks really good today <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
I am exhausted, emotional, and just done with everything and everyone.
If someone would buy me Starbucks at school today or bring some to me at work later, you will be my favorite
Goal for next school year: be one of those people who drives their motorcycles to school <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
All I want is you right now.
I should really be thanking you for everything. And one day I just might. And I hope it hits home.
Haven't been this angry in a very very long time.
I'm glad you're happy.
And to think that I actually spent my days thinking about you.
Not. In. The. Mood. <ANGRY FACE>
Cheating isn't only physical.

I'll be home at 2 btw :D
If somebody would be waiting at my house w/peanut butter parfait ice cream from Handles when I get home from school that'd be just fantastic

Just sliced my toe open and pretty sure I broke it too. On the same foot that's already messed up. Can my night get any worse?
Or come hug me as I cry

Have a great first day back babe! <FACE THROWING A KISS><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> @JasonBabnic
Just had 2 guys in the past minute tell me I'm hot...<FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@JasonBabnic nopee
@JasonBabnic @IntThings obviously you don't wanna make them since you only favored my tweet <OK HAND SIGN>
This is the most Jason has tweeted all summer
@JasonBabnic @IntThings wanna make them?
If anyone is at the fair and wants to bring me water or pop or some sort of beverage to the grandstands I will love you for life
<PERSEVERING FACE>
Tuesday, I start running again.
I missed emojis so much <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
So um this happened 
Demolition Derby!!! 
"World's Largest Demolition Derby" with a whopping total of 40 cars
This girl singing karaoke at the fair right now tho&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Words can't describe the level of pissed off I am right now.
I like this lab even more. It was done in 20 minutes
Please let this lab only last 40 minutes like my last one so I can go home and sleep
Either this guy is super tired or he's stoned at 7:40 AM
@Britney_Lane221 sweeet
@Britney_Lane221 done*
@Britney_Lane221 I'm don't at 11 tomorrow
@Britney_Lane221 of course. There's no other reason to go
Fair tomorrow? Anyone? Please.
One good thing about this day is my wrist is feeling so much better.
I guess I won't be feeling better anytime soon. Okay...
@H_BarkerForReal D':
It used to be different but the way things are going now...I don't know.
IDontKnowIDontKnowIDontKnowIDontKnowIDontKnowIDontKnowIDontKnow
But guys I promise you I woke up at 5, showered, and purposefully dressed like this
I look like I just rolled out of bed considering I'm wearing yoga capris and a cutoff
How can I stop it?
But its starting to head that way.
And this time I can't afford to mess up.
I drive myself crazy then always mess up because of it.
I don't know why I do this to myself.
Still at the bottom of the totem pole.
Class took 40 mintes instead of 3 hours. And since I don't have plans until noon, I decided to drive to Niles and to get gas for 3.13.
Well that was a waste of 40 minutes of my life
I should probably wash my wrist brace. Had it for 7 years, never been washed. It's smelling pretty funky
This phone can't come any sooner
I don't know yet
Or tomorrow
Maybe I'll go today after class...
I sorta want to go shopping....what's wrong with me?
I wish I was that cool
This girl rode her skate board thingy to class
And I'm one of these people...
The people who seem the most confident are usually the most insecure. It's just a mask so people don't ask questions.
I don't know how to turn these thoughts off
@NicoleHodgson13 dude this is my life at family reunions too
"Children, its like a small version of a cauldron" #halfasleepJasonquotes @JasonBabnic
Since nobody responded to my tweets and I'm starving i decided to make buffalo chicken dip #nofriends
I'm done for the day so ya know, food is always nice
So hungry
If anyone wants to kidnap me and grab lunch before I go to work, I'm done here at 1 so yeah
"Its college, you'll meet new people" as I'm surrounded by Canfield people
Guys my class only lasted like 10 minutes so I had a break and went pee
He can't even count the number of people in each row. How is he supposed to teach me..??
@GrumpyCatDallas Haha as long as I'm not alone
I'm not too sure how I feel about this
My "teacher" for this class is like 23....
Guys, I promise you I'm smart
So I have to returned 2 of my books cause I got the wrong ones
The biggest concern I have for today is when I'll have time to go pee #nobreaks
That awkward moment when you see someone you went to school with on campus but you didn't really talk to them so you both smile awkwardly
It actually kinds hurts hah
I used my left hand knowing I'd probably bowl soon. However, I didn't think about me carrying the tray at work with my left hand #whoops
I'm not going to be able to work tomorrow....
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut My weakness is that I care too much
The fact that I don't have to go to class tomorrow is fantastic
This is by far the coolest classroom ever
After having hour and a half long classes in high school, these 50 minute classes feel like nothing.
Note to self: if you want a spot in the parking garage and not be late for class, be on campus by 6:30.
Not really digging this storm since I need to wake up at 6 tomorrow...
@LynnetteSeebach 8 to 9 or 10 (can't remember and I'm not getting out of bed to look) then an hour break and classes till 1 haha
@LynnetteSeebach what time do you have class?
Okay.....
Applying for jobs is my favorite.
The Boardman marching band doesn't sound half bad this year
My life consists of trying to go to bed early but staying up all night instead cause I can't sleep
Getting ready to crawl in a dark hole in the ground and never come out....
I'm hard core craving grape juice right now. Please feel free to bring me some after work
Back to feeling insecure.
I don't ask for much.
Remember how that lasted for a day.
Sharing is caring.
Maybe if I sell my bowling stuff I wont be tempted to continue bowling.
My heart can't possibly break When it wasn't even whole to start with
@alexis_daisy I paid 65 dollar to have them put it through their water damage process to see if they can salvage it. If so we go from there
I quit bye.
He beat me by 20.
I beat Jason by 2 pins.
Determined to crush his soul this game.
I lost by 1 pin the first game.
I will keep everybody updated
Currently bowling with Jason.
@alexis_daisy yeah
I CAN'T STAND THIS PHONE ANYMORE. PLEASE GOD LET MY OTHER PHONE BE OKAY.
YSU isn't so scary. However, the idea of college makes me want to bury myself alive.
My cat is salty 24/7
I get ready for bed in waves.
College starts in a week. Brb crying.
Guess I'm a bitch.
No need to be so pissy. Go away.
Camelot Lanes. One hour. Be there or be square.
I do so much shit for other people and literally get nothing in return.
Getting cute texts at random times will melt every girls' heart. Just a tip.
He's into me for everything I'm not, according to you.
Camelot Lanes. Tuesday. 7PM. Be there.
Just slept for 3 hours. Still feel like I haven't slept in days. Back to bed
@LynnetteSeebach thank you
@LynnetteSeebach nope I had to be at work at 11
Jason is tainting my mind with his music
@JasonBabnic or talk to your b√¶ aka meeee
@JasonBabnic and that's why you love me
@LynnetteSeebach I literally just got home from work. Only had 2 hours of sleep in the past 46 hours
@LynnetteSeebach I'm like dragging my ass right now
All doneee 
And now I just sit in silence
@LynnetteSeebach me too and I have to work late tonight
@LynnetteSeebach girl same here
Should I attempt to sleep or is it not even worth it at this point?
So I gotta get up in two and a half hour then work until like 1 at night tomorrow. This is gunna be fun.
Sleep is for the weak
I wonder if anybody is jealous of me....?
Please, someone talk to me
If anybody's awake please text me I'm.begging you. I need the company and entertainment
Well that was my attempt to sleep.
I had a dream that I drove a Dodge Charger and now I really want one. Forget the ice cream, if you buy me one, I'll love you for eternity
I kinda didn't realize how much I miss my Pappy until now.....
My cat is all up in my grill and shit tryin to jack my oreos and milk
I finally got my ice cream
Still waiting on that ice cream that will never come.
Oh wait I have no friends to make me feel better. I forgot. How silly of me.
Or maybe a quart is better
If anybody would like to bring be a pint of peanut butter parfait ice cream from Handles ASAP, I will love you forever
Now I need ice cream even more.
I physically need ice cream right now.
When my dog barks at night and I'm the only one up, I just act like nothing happened cause I'm afraid to look outside
There's always that one person who you have to let go of no matter how bad it hurts and even tho you try, you can never forget them.
New life lesson: do not take phone near or around a toilet no matter the circumstances.
I hate times like these when I'm torn between cuddling with my cat and getting up and going pee
But for me it happens a lot so it's cool. Bye now <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
Never let a girl go to bed upset.
My cat is completely stretched out and has conformed to the shape of my leg.
Never to get the answer I want. The answer I need. <SLEEPY FACE>

I don't think Jason believed me when I told him it was monsooning at my house <HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN><UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>
@LynnetteSeebach hi it's Jason.
Wedgewood needs to open again. I'm tired of paying for bowling
Yup, still don't feel any better. Great<THUMBS UP SIGN>
Maybe if I cry I'll feel better. It's worth a shot.
This is exactly the kind of stuff that makes me feel like I'm unappreciated.
You can at least act like you're happy.
Well that made me feel good about myself.....
Trying to pick out a name for my laptop is the hardest decision of my life.

I miss my bestfriend. <PENSIVE FACE>
Everything comes before me. Okay.
Kinda tired of always being the one who gives in when I get nothing back in return.
Taking me for granted is a huge mistake.
I'm not freaking stupid.
I think I'm getting a cold.
What to do at 1 A.M.? Jam to Hilary Duff while playing a computer game

And you don‚Äôt know how bad it feels
To leave the only one that I have ever believed in
Sometimes I wanna be the one who gets cute texts. Not the one who send them.
Watching Family Guy alone in my house alone at 11:43 PM
No comment? K. Last time I do that.
@k_bates1995 beat....not hear
Jason is going on a hunger strike cause I hear him at Mario Kart
If I have to get ready fast and I just got out of the shower, I put my fan on high and lay on the floor until I'm dry. Works every time<THUMBS UP SIGN>

I lost my sister at handles.....
@JasonBabnic <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JasonBabnic until you start playing xbox
@JasonBabnic now you will stay up all night and want to sleep all day tomorrow so I'll just end up chilling with your dog on your birthday
Let's get real here, I really wasn't going to delete my Twitter
If I can figure out how to....
Deleting my Twitter. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><OK HAND SIGN><VICTORY HAND>
I would love to have friends where I can come to their house when I don't wanna be home anymore. But then I laugh cause I don't have friends
@alexis_daisy I don't. I needed a shirt for warped tour
@JasonBabnic sure sure
If @JasonBabnic doesn't like shopping with me he can stop coming.
Shopping is my favorite.
I got a thing for guys with blue eyes. And @JasonBabnic has blue eyes. So I got a thing for Jason.
My knee is so swollen I can't bend it #bowlingprobs
I feel like I'm embarrassing @JasonBabnic cause I'm dancing to the Cha Cha Slide and YMCA
But yet I still beat @JasonBabnic by 40 pins
Completely wiping out is my absolute favorite part of bowling.
If its a game you want, then it's a game you shall get.
Now I understand why people can't stand me.
Mad? When am I ever mad? <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>

It's cooler outside than it is in my house #noairconditioning
But I have like zero friends. See my problem?
Gosh I wish I had a friend I could use only for their pool
Should've just kept my mouth shut and dealt with it on my own.
Let's see how this goes down.
Kinda wish you'd ask why but I feel like it would cause problems so maybe you shouldn't....
Jason is playing with paint, bug spray, and fire. I think I'm gunna die
@H_BarkerForReal I've had a motorcycle haha I share it with my sister. And I got my sister's Jeep cause she bought her own car
Rode my motorcycle for the first time and went off roading in my Jeep. I'm a happy camper right now <WHITE SMILING FACE>

@TaylorMarie424 yes I do. Did I do it? No
Love how I can't eat the food in my own house.
Moody much?
It also might be the most sarcastic thing I've ever written
Who knew I could write a 3 page paper about my car
What would've made this day better, you ask?? If the water wasn't so freaking cold
@JasonBabnic oh I got you
@JasonBabnic well why are you still up then?!?! Silly boy
Research paper is DONE! Now I can sleep soundly tonight. Ha lets be real here, that's never going to happen
I just saw an old picture of my dog and now I feel like curling up in a little ball and crying. How's your night going?
There's 2 days of school left and I don't think I've had this much work to do all year <TIRED FACE>

You better not cross Daline
You stayed up and talked to me instead of sleeping. How sweet of you
Jason thought he was going to sleep in today. He got all excited for nothing
I've got a jar of dirt I've got a jar of dirt
I'm having Pirates of the Caribbean withdrawals. Wanna watch then over the weekend with me please?
Robert hi
Apparently Mike eats like a pregnant lady at night and it really frustrates him
Okay that's not cool man
"A whole new world" I would be the one to refrence a Disney movie at this point
So this is your world? A strange one it is
Quote if the night: "I ain't able to carry no three drinks, Jenny!"
Seriously how are you favoriting my tweets so fast? You like living on Twitter right now or somethin?
&lt;3
Fine don't believe me.
You're my favoritest
Uh yeah
Probably a combination of both
Because you were like screwing with my car or something! You deserved a beating
And you found that out the hard way
I can be so adorable sometimes
Keep it coming boy
I feel like favoriting all of your We're The Miller's quotes
I would but I gots an internet limit
I don't ever think I've had this much fun on Twitter
Just kidding I'll go I'm just going to bathe in bug spray before hand
#SorryNotSorry
The only way I'm going in the woods with you again is if it's -30¬∞ outside. I can't deal with these mosquito bites anymore
Oh yeah sure
Wow way to knock somebody down
Why can't I be as cool as Jason Babnic and go in to school late tomorrow? #Redo
Oh yeah I have to give a speech. That's why
Why can't I be as cool as Jason Babnic and stay home from school tomorrow?
@JasonBabnic I know I'm just playin
Jason just said I look ugly in every picture I take. Wow way to boost a girls self confidence
How does Jason favorite my tweets so fast
Seeing Jason tweet quotes from We're The Miller's is quite amusing
I no understand Twitter Lingo. Jason, teach me the waysss
I think I need to go play with puppies to make me feel better.
Normally music would make me feel better. But right now, it's just annoying me even more.
Today is not going to be a good day so please refrain from pissing me off or it will get ugly.
No sleep. Today is going to be fun.
Seriously I'm still as white as I was in December. Like how?
Laid outside for 3 hours, did not tan at all -_-
@JasonBabnic yes, yes
@JasonBabnic I know but I still tweeted at you because I wanted to say hiiii
@JasonBabnic I tweeted at you
@JasonBabnic hi :)
@JasonBabnic you hate me
That's because most of the time they do
Jason made some serious cash this weekend in a fancy hotel with a waterside
@JasonBabnic I know
I was so motivated yesterday. However, today is a different story
Well live with it, Jason
I'm sorry I was tired, Jason
@JasonBabnic I'm so proud of you!!
@JasonBabnic that's exactly what it is
@JasonBabnic son of a toaster!!
@JasonBabnic if you get here in the next 5 minutes I'll pay you in trident layers
@JasonBabnic maybe if you stopped tweeting at me so much you'd get here sooner and kill those spiders so I can sleep.
@JasonBabnic oh yeah? 
@JasonBabnic the one time you actually got something important to do is the time when you're actually hungry -_-
@JasonBabnic damn it Jason! Run back home! Run Jaaaaason Run!!!
@JasonBabnic walk fasterrrr
@JasonBabnic you're probably the only one awake right now so you better come and save me
@JasonBabnic you'll do
Be my best fraaaand and come kill the spiders in my room please
If you just believe
       ~A Cinderella Story
Noooo
For me it's a good thing. But my mom judges me
I don't think I've ever texted a person so much
Is time going by faster now??
Jason thinks I forgot about subtweeting about him. He is highly mistaken
@JasonBabnic I take this as a challenge
Niko is going to be so upset when I leave in 6 days
Niko's text to me " Omeguh u were totes magotes cereal"
He has no choice
Niko will come to the junior/senior banquet
That was a good bonding experience for Niko and I outside of chem
Niko and I have matching pens. We were ment to be best friends!!!
But he's been sober for 12 years. Stay strong
Niko is a twerkaholic
I love it when Niko texts me at 6 in the morning asking me about chem
Maybe drinking this liter of flavored water before bed wasn't a good idea #Igottapee
For once I'm not tired. What is life?!
I didn't think I'd like this swiping letters thing to text but now I can't text normally
Not to self: cover face AND arm next time you ride on the trails
@JasonBabnic no.
Perks of being a girl -_-
Aloe Vera is my best friend right now
I am tired and grumpy and I don't wanna deal with this
@alexis_daisy it's not bad stop
I will always love Demons by Imainge Dragons
@JasonBabnic you can't control me
@JasonBabnic why not?
Just 10 more days and I won't have to deal with this shit anymore
I feel like subtweeting about Jason again
I don't know if I'll be able to love the same again
@kristengabes I was just in the rain for a minute and I'm soaked
@kristengabes I've seen 5 lightening strikes in the past 2 minutes
I gave my speech about Tornadoes just in time @kristengabes

"@ElenaAnele34: @k_bates1995 @TFerk12 ferkalicious <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>" that describes everything
Guys, @TFerk12 is actually a really fun time
@JasonBabnic it was beautiful
This isn't over yet
Jason doesn't understand that I don't keep my data on all day to subtweet at him
Not yet man. I'm making my way there but not totally
I'm kinda having fun right now. Are you?
I subtweet about you like it's my job
He is underestimating me quite a lot right now and all it's going to do is give him false hope
I don't think Jason understands that he has no way of winning this
I have a feeling Jason and I are going to go start a subtweeting war
I'm also going to start subtweeting about him a lot
Now I'm going to purposefully favorite all of Jason's tweets because he thinks I already do it
@JasonBabnic I always win
@JasonBabnic liessss
@JasonBabnic not everythinggg
Watching my sister try to take a snapchat is literally the best thing ever
Happy Birthday MisterDoctorProfessorPatrickJoelZaluski!!! @JoelZaluski124
"@JasonBabnic: Everybody loves the beetles, and I personally don't think they are all that great." Oh my gosh thank you!!!
@JasonBabnic thank you I take pride in it
You get a girlfriend and you don't talk to me anymore. I see what role I played in your life now. Thanks.
While everybody else was out partying last night, I was partying at work and eating free Handles ice cream. Who's the real winner here?
I feel like I need a hug but I'm not sure
How do people know I love being excluded from plans?! Because it keeps happening and it's just fantastic
@JasonBabnic his loss
@JasonBabnic well he's missing out big time! Haha
@JasonBabnic I will!! I've always wanted to be a part of the super awesome cool kids allegiance!
@JasonBabnic ah thank you!
@JasonBabnic ohheeyyy I guess I do!
All I think about is food and sleep. Like everyday
If you don't like me anymore I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me so I can stop trying. Thanks
Why I can't get a new phone: Verizon hates me
Why I need a new phone: battery sucks, screen doesn't work, no notifications for anything but texts, and now I can't send or recieve texts
@Britney_Lane221 now you know my life
@gretch161 the waters fine! My cat is still kicking!
And now my phone won't send texts or receive them. That's why I need a new one
Stood in line for an hour and a half to get a new phone only to find out that Verizon is down and I can't activate it
Just pointed out a Bon Jovi song by its guitar solo #obsessed
"Possible Food Poisoning Sickens 100 at a national Food Safety Summit" ummmm.....
The one time I get a raging migraine that won't go away is when the water is contaminated and I can't drink it to take some medicine
Who needs to go to prom when you can have a dance party with your coworkers during another schools prom?
Laying in bed eating reeses pieces hating the world and I love it
I've been living in my sister's room for the past 2 weeks
I really want to go to Barnes and Noble
"Let's just assume for the moment that everybody is here doesn't like me" Flynn Rider feels my pain
Your dream stinks. I was talking to her
For how many time Flynn Rider gets hit in the head with a frying pan he shouldn't be able to function properly the rest of the movie
After watching Frozen repeatedly, I can say I still like Tangled so much better
Well the seagulls are back it town
No more dress and pepperoni roll, Happiest I've been all day
And grapes are toxic to dogs but Kelly ate them everyday from the vine and lived to be 14...interesting

@gretch161 I know! She wasn't quiet about it either
This lady in Bob Evans is talking about sexting with her 5 year old son...
With a taste of your lips I‚Äôm on a ride
I have a feeling @A_Pupino will never ride in a car with me ever again
I have no luck with cars anymore. Maybe I should invest in a camel for transportation
Guys a creepers van just drove down my road...oh wait that was my dad
My rabbit just peed on me

@Cambags3 @stephh_franco @ElenaAnele34 @hannah_mattix17 @Delanieeeee @Britney_Lane221 so bowling today?
The fact that I had to get a shower today cause I'm going out in public just killed my mood
Sitting in the sparkle parking lot people watching
@Showtime4413 thats deep man
I should probably start doing the invites for my grad party
That 4 hour nap was well overdue
Its a Hobbit sort of day here in 31 degree Canfield, Ohio
@stephh_franco @Cambags3 @ElenaAnele34 @hannah_mattix17 @Delanieeeee @Britney_Lane221 I agree

@stephh_franco @Cambags3 @ElenaAnele34 @hannah_mattix17 @Delanieeeee @Britney_Lane221 Friday??
Ohio...the only place where you can have sunburn one day and frost bite the next
I'm sitting on the roof of my car cause I don't wanna leave
@alexis_daisy what did you do this time?
Cleaning out the explorer today makes all this so real #restinpeace
@stephh_franco @Cambags3 @ElenaAnele34 @hannah_mattix17 @Delanieeeee @Britney_Lane221 I'm good any day!
Guys, we must go bowling some time this week @stephh_franco @Cambags3 @ElenaAnele34 @hannah_mattix17 @Delanieeeee @Britney_Lane221
@Britney_Lane221 my cat does that on the daily
I'm super excited for spring break. Not because I'm going somewhere but because I get to take care of horses the whole week
I shouldn't be this upset about my car but I really am sad. I loved her
You served us well and was the best first car I could ask for. You will be greatly missed RIP Vanna &lt;/3 
Apparently tie-dying is intense
Oh yeah that's mature
I see mars and I feel cool
I take great pride in the fact that I can rap Juicy J's part in Dark Horse perfectly
Guys you'll be able to see mars tonight. I'm pretty excited about this
Oh that's funny hahahaha
The list of people I'm inviting to my grad party is rapidly diminishing. This means less food to make and less expensive. Hey its a win win
My new plan after graduation: get a car, drive away, find a nice remote place in the mountains, and live alone forever
I picked a good day to get ice cream
I'm just sitting in the school parking lot cause I don't wanna go home
That might've been the cutest thing I've ever seen
Your random outbursts of anger are quite annoying and unnecessary
K bye.
@ElenaAnele34 me want
Well that lab write up took forever
You know just sitting on a pile of cat litter in a pet store
Bad mood Sunday has begun
@theroyalqueen17 I definitely will! Haha
@theroyalqueen17 he probably would've said hi back Haha he's a friendly person
@theroyalqueen17 that's awesome!
@theroyalqueen17 yeah hes been dying to go! I didn't know you worked there!
I just thought of a really good metaphor comparing friendship to a spare tire
I just found the German version of Let It Go
The heart is not so easily changed. However, the head can be persuaded.
@Britney_Lane221 so I can't to anywhere
@Britney_Lane221 my moms car broke too
I don't wanna sit around the house all day. Help
Seriously I'm losing my mind
I'm so restless today! I need to do something but I don't know what!!
The fact that my cat cuddled with me all night on her own free will is why I still like her
You are so judgmental I can't take it
Does anyone have a copy of A Thousand Splendid Suns I can borrow for English? Please please please
@Britney_Lane221 I try
@Britney_Lane221 I would of I had a car
Sometimes I completely forget I have a tattoo
My conversation with @Showtime4413 right now&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@LJ_Heldreth96 thats the most brilliant thing I've ever heard
I'm sick of being everybody's second choice....and last choice
I hate relying on other people for rides
Guys my phone is back but my contacts are no more. Give me your numbers! Please :)
"Do you want to fence Laertes? Do you wanna build a snowman?"
Had my phone and car die on me all in 1 week. Life is grand
I can't stop eating. This is a problem
Wearing my hair up for the first time in like 4 months
Why do I always get sick when I stay at hotels? This is getting real old
@omgitskelsie13 I don't think she knows yet
@omgitskelsie13 YSU
"I feel like a girl"
For the one booth at orientation, they had tampons sitting out
No shame
Oh, well would you look at that! Funny isn't it?
And again I come home to darkness cool cool
I just whispered "I love you" to one of the zombies
Oh look who's here together
"And I don't beat them"
The sun this morning&gt;&gt;&gt;
@Britney_Lane221 she thinks so
Ayla, why do feel a need to lay on my homework and take a nap?
@Britney_Lane221 oh my you poor child
@Britney_Lane221 I haven't been to the circus in like 3 years
@Britney_Lane221 me please
@JoelZaluski124 I'm devastated!!!
@JoelZaluski124 ahhh oh my gosh and I'm not home to watch it!! D:
Come to DQ in cornersburg!! Donate to akron children's hospital and you get a free cone out of it!
That time when Britney put her head on the table then sat back up and there was a piece of bread on her forehead&gt;&gt;&gt;
@Britney_Lane221 OMFG
I'm kind of dreading going pee in my dress and tights tonight. Those things are so hard to get back up
@Britney_Lane221 this banquet better be fantastic...I'm wearing my contacts for the first time in like 2 weeks for this thing
@Britney_Lane221 like I'm literally starving. All I wasn't is to eat food then leave
The only reason I want to go to this banquet is so I can eat
@emileelovesyou7 just remember the pickle...and Ayla
I hope my twin @emileelovesyou7 doesn't have nightmares tonight about Smaug
I forgot how good apples tasted....until my jaw cracked then I remembered why I don't eat them often
I think I'm the only girl who can't curl their hair #tomboyprobs
You can't tell were related or anything @alexis_daisy 
@Cambags3 I know!!!! D:
3 peperoni rolls in 10 minutes and I don't even care
@Cambags3 Dude same here. I ruined it when I went to watch the boys at state this year
Let's see if @mjbgaming123 responds to this tweet
This book just said "new social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace"
If you were an apple, you'd be a red delicious #dailyapplejoke
@Britney_Lane221 kitteh
And this is exactly why I want to quit bowling
@emileelovesyou7 we're twins with every thing we do
I've been sitting on my bed in a towel for the past 20 minutes because I don't want to get dressed #thingsgirlsdo
@LJ_Heldreth96 @Britney_Lane221 she vented to me first so HA
@Britney_Lane221 probably not
