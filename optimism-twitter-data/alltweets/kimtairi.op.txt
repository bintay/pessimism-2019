@vaha_began @dgunsberg David has a big brain :) #economist
@lmh_1888 @dgunsberg I nailed his hair :)
when one of the #keynotes says your tweets are a breath of fresh air - you win the social "media" for the day #justsaying <FISTED HAND SIGN>üèº<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #THETA2015

Millicent cried into her lukewarm skinny chai. The waiter looked over, smiled and mouthed "you okay?" She nodded as pushed her chai away.
Social Media as a professional tool: Gimmick, Godsend or Risk? 
@MarksMorsels I stayed in bed... I had regrets now!
@dgunsberg yes - I don't snapchat but know heaps of librarians that do... I am considered when I post to Instagram despite the high volume

@gotanda I think it would fit well with the thinking here #space #campus #THETA2015
@ddonahoo @librariano agreed - hence #adaptable spaces on #campus #THETA2015
@ddonahoo @librariano shouldn't we also provide the building blocks like Lego so they can build #THETA2015 #campus
#campus How do you get involved students in the design of learning spaces? Should they be?  #THETA2015
#adaptable tech-enabled spaces rather than #flexible #learningspaces #THETA2015
#THETA2015 #campus #academics like Oprah #entertainers she wants to come into a room &amp; tech to work so she can engage students in learning
@MRNM40 @unilibrary it's lovely :)
#THETA2015 @unilibrary #justintime #learning #library research skills

Open vs closed worlds #highered @BryanAlexander #sketchnote #THETA2015 
I think an open world has badgers and foxes frolicking #THETA2015 #highered
Putting it out there I don't want to work/live in a closed world #THETA2015 @BryanAlexander sounds like a horrible #postapocalyptic world
@BryanAlexander deep &amp; bloody battle with publishers open vs closed #THETA2015 with frog #sketchnote 
@jillebenn i have ordered them in blue too!
@BryanAlexander okay tech working now #THETA2015 #sketchnote EBOOKS HAVE THE MARKET #tippingpoint in #highered

@tseenster @siandart @pmnewton me too... Ned is such a finely drawn complex character and felt real :)

@KRidwyn @siandart oh yes Carmody wonderful especially the early ones :)
@siandart big call BUT I liked #artemisfowl more than Harry Potter IMHO  ;)
@siandart Garry Disher's crime fic is excellent; I adore #eoinColfer - Artemis Fowl series #kidsbooks
@flexnib @siandart #elizabethHand - available dark &amp; generation loss more #crimfic bit dark though but riveting
@siandart #sarahwaters - the paying guests
@tseenster there will be Star Wars quotes too #theta15 #geekout
Just before I drop the iPad on her - she is giving me the evil eye now! 
Trapped under cat again... 
@sallyturbitt @siandart @pmnewton @AnitaHeiss @RGalbraith big fan of crime fic as a genre :)

#city9 I always carry a notebook &amp; sharpies to write down things that inspire me or catch my eye. I often turn it into shareable poems.
#city9 sit on the stairs by the info centre in #federationsquare and people watch make up back stories for people
#city9 wonder through @RMIT and @unimelb campus amazing buildings and great architecture
#city9 I am biased because I'm a #librarian but the @Library_Vic #statelibrary is amazing - visit the dome room for inspiration
