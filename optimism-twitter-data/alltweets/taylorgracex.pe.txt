trying to wrap presents with shaky hands, my wrapping is awful as it is so at least I have am excuse...
feel so sick :|
every year my nan cries at my Christmas cards, bless her little heart
mad to think this time 2 christmas' ago how amazing everything was...
dont no how a girl you can smile in another girls face and slag her off rotten to everyone else yet she was there for u when you had no one
today has been unreal amounts of annoying and Iv genuinely lost any kind of patience
the amount of bullshit one person can speak, highly entertaining
it's like what? a week before Christmas, smile and leave your negativity at the door, no time for miserable people!
when you're so cold you lose the ability to speak brrrrrr
you know it's bad when someone won't write the full word to speak to you, I'm worth more than a number in a word, we ain't 13 on b3b0
blaaa
woah roads are ridiculously slippy :| swear I just nearly died
