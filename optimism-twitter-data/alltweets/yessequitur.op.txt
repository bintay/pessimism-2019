@UCPLsgC8otad Waw......
i suppose the name of the page isnt a lie tho. i mean, i cringe pretty hard when i see hundreds of dudebros calling feminism "cringeworthy"
The Cringe Channel: my disobedient wife will not go back to the kitchen [MAXIMUM TUMBLR CRINGE]
look at this Stupid Feminazi wearing a shirt that says "kill all men". LOL. the cringe is real. Epic Fail. Tumblr.
"look at this woman holding a sign that says "im a feminist". LOL, cringeworthy much!"
that cringe channel facebook page has done a full loop around and the admins' choices of what to post are now painfully cringe-inducing
@SSF1991 sonic heroes was essentially a sonic adventure 3, though
i feel good!!! and it's not just conditional! even when im bored and alone i feel fine... super like 
removed the [rough patch] bit from my description, who knew that one conversation could fix like 70% of my troubles
#mouthness. Your time is up, my time is now. You can't see me, my time is now. It's the franchise, boy I'm shinin' now. You can't see me

@prism_lite i know, its just... argh, i have so little funds and so much Important Life Stuff to buy now. adulthood sucks
@prism_lite jesus. fucking. christ. lmfao. im so jealous of y'all and all yer MONEY. anything over like 20 bucks is a Big Transaction for me
@melbaghost man i remember in 2013 i went through a huge phase with both that album and yume nikki it was awesome
@prism_lite either youre rich or you got a bootleg lmao
@prism_lite wtf isnt this super rare
im at that point of tiredness where im literally swaying in my chair drifting in and out of conciousness this is fun

@yessequitur bump
@Iiboharz LMFAOO
@Iiboharz this was the best idea ive ever had

@NerdbotMk2 specifically sonic heroes' shadow voice
@ShadowGiritina @AmpyPony hahaha no way those are dead as hell. seapunk was The Big Thing in like 2011. im tryin not to just cling to trends
@DeadDigitizer dw im mentally still 17 lmfao
@ammnontet yeah even now there are a few like, 15 year olds im in mutuals with and while theyre cool and mature for theyre age its still idk
@yessequitur it got kinda weird lol
oh wow you guys are all around my age thats kind of relieving. on tumblr id always end up in a group where everyone was younger than me
@ammnontet haha youre old... dw i have another 24 year old friend youre not alone
i dont know how old half of you guys are its so weird. reply with your age im curious (for reference im 20)
@DeadDigitizer shit that iphone case looks killer, really nice work dude
@HFMiles instantly liked
@doetunes yea people used me as leverage like "LOOK AT THIS TOTALLY FAMOUS HORSE MUSICIAN" or whatever and its like. dl my mixtape first fam
actually, ive got it. i have good t-shirt ideas. yes. i will make these work
@doetunes and its the same with soundcloud. over 500 followers and they only care about Funny Mashup Joke Gangnam Style Haha Comedy
@doetunes god i remember back when i had 3.5k on my original blog and yeah nobody cared about my music lmao
@AmpyPony maybe, but theres already a lot of shirts like that. im carving out a weird internet culture niche and its working so far haha
@AmpyPony .........................i think ill pass on this one
@DeadDigitizer good lord i need to start designing scarves lmfao
@drugleaf thanks. thank you
@mitomoro oh lol
@mitomoro like just

"Ironic Phrases"
seriously, pitch me shirt ideas. anything. even if it's really stupid. my stupidest shirt netted me over a hundred bucks profit over two yrs
*bangs table* i! need! to! design! more! shirts! but! i! have! no! fresh! ideas!
@theshrillest i never owned any nintendo home consoles until the release of the wii
@Burdmew yep, flat rate of 35usd to ship anything to australia. welcome to my life
i suppose ill sit it out until next month, if i can rake in another 30 bucks it should be no problem
if this was in aud id be able to just afford it. $100 including shipping... but sadly its in usd so its $130aud so Fuc My Life
FUCK why does shipping from archie comics to here have to be fucking 35usd thats almost 50aud fuck theyre COMICS come on
i cant really use this for irl stuff so what do i spend it on
what d hell i have like 65 bucks in my paypal i love redbubble
@angelfurn nothing! were probably just gonna get a new tank before this one collapses or something
now im listening to a '94 jungle mix and figuring out how to best advertise a turtle tank on ebay
i accidentally stayed up all night playing sonic adventure dx and i accidentally had a really bad nap too nice.... nice...... my eyes burn
@hackdSounds HAHAHA god they gave me such a headache. never completed their storyline or team dark's. im replaying it atm though so yea
source: 
@poniesaregay @hackdSounds @CiiMassacre @TrentSinclaire 
i never even finished sonic heroes as a kid lol. i might try and see if i can soon, though, its been long enough
its funny, ive been playing them for a decade and i love them to death but im just. not good at sonic games in general
@hackdSounds HAHA yeah it gets in the way of speedrunning, definitely. but then again i was never actually that good at sonic games, really
@hackdSounds its goofy as hell but i love it, i like being able to walk around instead of just instantly cutting from level to level
why is the sonic franchise so poorly treated by sega. what did we do to deserve any of this
also WHY DONT THE BABYLON ROGUES GET ANY LOVE THEYRE MY BABIES
i love this game's overworld, why didnt they keep it in sa2? and more importantly, why didnt they keep the chao gardens in heroes
man im playing sonic adventure dx for the first time in like a decade and im just strolling through memory lane of my sonic phase
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists: Knife Party (8), Sunn O))) (7) &amp; Death Grips (7)

@SheepyTina cute omfg!!!
@ammnontet which states? ill have to check it out if i ever visit america again
@ammnontet ive never even heard of that
@poniesaregay worth it!
hopefully in the near future i can get prosthetic breasts to fill it with yeah
for real though this is the comfiest thing ever im so blessed to have a bra that actually FITS PROPERLY LMAO
im still getting used to wearing a bra its just like "O my god. Boobs"
well that was really good. i think i might play some video games for a bit and go to sleep. yeah, that sounds good
dom &amp; roland is amazing. i am not nearly as familiar with his works as i should be. i plan to correct this starting now
new header. i dont even remember the source of the image lol
@icybutt OMGGGGGG NOOOOOOOOOOOO
@Noteworthypony eh, not really. idk, im not good at talking 1-on-1 with people. thank you for caring, though
@godtributes @angelfurn cam blob
ok, good, a nice gay group skype to keep me preoccupied when im home. i needed this a lot actually
i love not being able to confront anything or anyone
"ok, fuck it, im gonna talk to-- o-oh, ok, offline 5 minutes ago. they uh, they might be busy, better uhhh. better not hey :)"
im just gonna mope around and listen to autechre all night i think
@yessequitur am i really so fragile now that hearing a single song will send me spiraling into horrifying despair and sadness? fuck this
@yessequitur i actually had to leave because i almost broke into hysterics, i was hyperventilating. i cant fucking do this.
neighbours were over, was having a chat with them + the fam and mum puts some music on every planet we reach is dead by gorillaz comes on

@UCPLsgC8otad @JobSecret19948 [cdi link voicw] I won!
.@JobSecret19948 O my god.
im gonna be legitimately crushed if centerlink reject my youth allowance claim though i need money so bad hhhah
@DeadDigitizer goodnight, squidward! i hope you sleep well
you haven't even asked if i'm ok and i'm not sure whether its because you don't care or you're deliberately dodging that conversation
i still think whats getting me down the most is that it feels like someone who was my best friend has stopped caring about me entirely
sports tweets
i like this name because bots address me as a queen
@HFMiles yeah i used to play roblox all the time in like 2009, used to be a blast building stuff. it's not even about building anymore lol

@tinawhines shid, sorry, ill delete it now! didnt mean to cause any offense (except to racist bogans)
man today sucks. theres beer in the fridge though so thats good
gghhhgugghhjjjb
@yessequitur "fangin for a durry but still waiting on me bloody centerlink dole"
@yessequitur missing suggestion: "going walkabout with me swagman to the billabong to meet me sheila and the anklebiters"
yes, facebook, i get it, im australian 
@DeadDigitizer you rang
@generalmumble YEAH YEAH JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER 16 HOURS FIRST
@generalmumble well, its almost 5:30 now, might get up, crack open a pepsi and continue poisoning my body &gt;:~)
@generalmumble like a lot of my defining traits to people (esp hyperactivity) are def results of too much sugar... weird to think about
@generalmumble honestly its such an ingrained part of my life that without it my entire persona would probably change
@generalmumble my whole life ive been trying... my progress is essentially:
- i dont hate apples now. unless they have skin
lmao
@generalmumble and the stuff thats most filling/satisfying (i eat a lot all things considered) is either expensive or really sugary hahah
@generalmumble so no vegetables, fruit, seafood, nuts... i could go on. my diet is super limited.
@generalmumble idk how to describe it other than "i dont like it" = "i cant eat it", i didnt develop taste/texture tolerance as a kid
@yougainbrouzouf see i dont even have that sort of money, i have 0 income atm lol. when i get the money im just gonna get a gtx970 i think
@generalmumble i can totally get that but like... due to autism stuff i am pretty much incapable of eating healthy its horrible lmao
@Half_Viv its alright
@generalmumble oh god this is such an unfamiliar concept its actually scary lmfao
@candigore maaaybe... any way you can gimme a list of everyone there? a lot of ppl from tumblr etc hate me to death so
@yessequitur id say lets play videogames all the time but im still running onboard processor graphics lollll
i want a big active skype group with frequent to distract myself with constantly, that worked in 2012 pretty well
lrt is basically queen polistae's design ideas in a nutshell
@generalmumble @TrentSinclaire hell yes it would. too bad were all literally about as far apart from another as geologically possible lol
@TrentSinclaire @generalmumble hahahaha
for real tho id love to be roommates with both of you, thatd rule
@Half_Viv give me a few months at the very least lol. thank you for caring, though
@Half_Viv broke up
@generalmumble @TrentSinclaire hey whats this about being inside fridges
@generalmumble i stayed awake for 30 hours unable to sleep and i only managed to get 5 hours after that, i gave up going back to sleep at 3
@generalmumble maybe later, its 4:30 am and i cant find the energy to get out of bed. thank you so much though
that combined with the fact im no longer with my partner and i dont have a constant source of affection... its like a drug withdrawal
my default emotion isnt happy or anything anymore, its crippling sadness. like that is what i inevitably revert to no matter what now
im sorry to all who know the silly, optimistic... happy me. shes still there, she just needs some coaxing to come out
she was my entire life for like three years. i shared all my music and interests with her, and now its all too painful to enjoy
moving on would be so much easier if i didnt have such a photographic memory. every little thing is so painful
i miss her so much, man. i miss us. i cant function without what we had, its tearing me apart very quickly
god i just want to go to sleep and not wake up again i cant take this anymore
yknow i was enjoying my first sleep in 30 hours but ok, i guess 5 hours of sleep after that is enough..?
@Ropusaru hahahaha, projecting a bit, are we?
i havent shaved in like a week, i feel absolutely disgusting lollllll
@Ropusaru i dont even have any anger left to channel, just sadness
@prism_lite why is make lyric hard
i want to vent via writing for music but i am absolutely terrible at it, even if it just spoken word stuff. me bad at write song
*keeps making bad jokes to distract myself from crippling depression* back to the grind
@drugleaf skrillex releases an ep and accidentally leaves a lowpass on the master, spawning the new microgenre "next door neighbourstep"
uuuggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh
"whitney, are you alright?"
"im fine, ive just got tfw no gf" why did i type that thinking it was a good idea i hate myself seeya later
having physical pain from heartbreak is the lamest shit, if anybody asks me why im clutching my chest i have to go all fuckin drake on em
either way that would explain why ive felt like ive been on the verge of a heart attack all week. the brain is stupid
oh its... actually a real thing what the hell lol. apparently your heart keeps trying to speed up and slow down simultaneously or s/t. weird
am i having heart problems or am i actually so heartbroken i can physically feel it? is that even a thing?
@RippleFrog i actually really like megas from a gameplay perspective. they added a LOT of unpredictability to the competitive metagame
@RippleFrog dont get me wrong, swampert is another personal fave of mine. he really grew on me after his mega forme was revealed
@Kryptolith yeah i dont get that tweet at all
@RippleFrog flygon and gardevoir are basically my two favourite pokemon so im giving this the thumbs up. blaziken would perfect it tho ;~)
@Xires1 yeah, that game was a masterpiece. wish i could have played it more. when i get a new gpu ill have to grab a copy on steam
it'd be almost impossible to make a 3d sonic game that's both fun and not twitchy/wonky/buggy. sonic generations came pretty close though
like, dont get me wrong, i LOVE 3d sonic games to death, but by god are they frustrating lmfao
honestly from an objective standpoint 3d sonic games are generally all really just fickle, hard to control and a mess of wonky physics
@SheepyTina i was talking more about like, the worlds themselves. like, every level is DISTINCTLY memorable; the worlds are so pretty
@SheepyTina yeah, when you played in speed formation heroes was fucking FAST lmfao
though ill still stand by the fact that sonic heroes had some of - if not THE best level designs out of any sonic game
also the stage-triggered voice clips could have been cute but just get really repetitive after a while. esp with tails, cream and big
i love sonic heroes a lot but jesus christ the character switching is so buggy. i don't remember it being this bad at all what the hell
@Noteworthypony im fine, all things considered i think? it's just gonna be a turbulent/neurotic few months for me while i get my head sorted
instead of the weak, pathetic, reliant, emotional... thing i am
i actually legitimately want to suck all emotion from my brain and just become that weird mysterious smug character
damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it fuck
damn it why am i so bitter about this. why cant i be happy
constantly feeling left behind, unimportant
sad, tired, lonely
someone buy me a gtx970 thanks i need it for my uhhhhh. my mental health. yea
@burgeroise funnily enough there is a WEALTH of bizarrely well drawn/animated pony porn flashes
like, my motherboard just held this loud, continuous high note and it sounded like it was screaming. scared the absolute shit out of me
i tried installing my dad's old graphics card into my pc for fun and when i booted it up it started fucking SCREAMING in protest
@Meelz93 holy shit that is EXACTLY what im looking for, thank you so much. will defo have to save up for some one day
not only would i be able to have some serious fun at arcades when i get good but holy shit i might actually get FIT from that
for real though, i love stepmania on keyboard, but i want to get good at pad play. it just sounds like so much more fun
iiiiiii want a ddr/itg machine. or a good third-party controller that isnt just a mat or something
@syrupf yeah i love this to death. its so strikingly... weird. but not just like "haha how wacky", it instills a genuine curiosity
who cares
wait how is it almost 4 am
backed! i'm investing not just in a game, but (hopefully) in a revival of my favourite game genre @PlaytonicGames 
anyone got a good wikihow tutorial on how to shed the last of my humanity and become a metaphysical entity? thanks in advance

@Half_Viv where are the horse FACTS
@Half_Viv warning: its horse fiction 
@skele_tan this just happened to me too hahaha
good to know ive very quickly snapped back to extremely neurotic
i posted some stuff on here and then i read this really good story for an hour and i suddenly feel a hell of a lot better

should i make a personal twitter? probably. do i want to? not really
♬ courtesies that i might be someone i wanna be a woman ♪
@DJ_EBOOKS request portishead
it just doesnt feel like ill ever be as happy as i was in, say, february ever again
why. just why in general. why havent i had a solidly "good" year since 2011. i mean, the last half of 2012 was perfect but the first half...
why cant i just go back in time three years and say just a few sentences to 17-year old me
im so terrified im regressing back into early 2012 levels of severe depression
i started to think that i was mentally healthy enough to survive without her but evidently not. im am absolute wreck.
i went to go clean myself up and refresh myself and i ended up sitting on the shower floor choking on my own tears and banging the walls
i wonder if hayley williams likes french onion dip. today we find out
.@yelyahwilliams hello Hayley Williams, do you like french onion dip?
im really sorry, guys. im sure ill get better with time... but for now, im a complete and utter mess, please bear with me
i cant live like this. i really need to start seeing my psyche again more often. i am... im completely broken atm
i literally spent 10 minutes not doing anything - just sitting around and nursing a glass of water - that was enough to almost make me cry
i love being a broken shell of someone who was more or less happy just a few days ago
wow im completely falling to pieces arent i hahaha nice cool epic
im also not going to be able to listen by anything off the first 3 gorillaz albums. or ITAOTS. oh god im gonna be able to listen to nothing
whispers pt ii by culprate has gone from melancholy to downright fucking depressing to me. im not gonna be able to listen to it for a while
ive been making mashups all night, 5th dicksquad album is definitely confirmed
my sibling posted some paramore lyrics on the gamergate tumblr tag and like 5 guys are hounding them i'm going to fucking wet myself

@yessequitur this was a good tweet
Gd Mrng Frndz..
god god god god god i hate how fast my brain moves, i need to keep reading, im so sorry everyone
just sitting around with my two favourite people playing starbound for a week on end was one of the best periods of my whole life
if i woke up in a infinite timeloop of around december to february id be perfectly content with staying there until i died
GOODNIGHT
ok, ok, gotta keep myself occupied all the time, alright, alright, ok, alright *tries to do pushups and collapses* uuuuuuuu
ok, sleep. well, reading until i fall asleep. i can't just "go to sleep", my mind will inevitably snap back to... well, everything.
i know that was mainly because she kept toying me along... but still. this time... 3 years. don't wanna do the math. too depressing
i just can't do this for too long, it isn't sustainable. but... last time it was like 9 months, and it took... 4 months? to fully recover
god i'm gonna just read until i fall asleep, i'm hurting bad and i'm going to continue feeling like this unless i keep myself occupied :~(
i just hope it doesn't remind me too much of how this all began, back in july 2012
i think i might reread homestuck, actually. that's more than time-consuming and mind-occupying enough to work, actually
i literally cant live like this. i need to download some more tv shows or something. i need to distract myself constantly. for months.
man this sucks. im great when im around my friends, but if im not with them for like an hour i just get so horrifyingly cripplingly SAD
you'd think i'd learn after this happening before at the end of 2010 but no i'm still a complete fucking moron evidently
god what the fuck is wrong with me why do i torture myself by dwelling on times long-gone whenever something goes wrong it's so so bad

*tries to start a conversation* *types out a message* *quickly erases all of it* *closes window* good chat
ughhhh fucking hell i need to hang out with jay or something, i cant do this on my own
i want to go home but i also really do not want to tell my parents whats happened
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists: Whitney feat. A Deer Joke (14), Pendulum (13) &amp; Death Grips (13) 
this is going to be one nasty winter, probably
i just need to distract myself so i dont dwell on just how deep the knife went i guess
that "while" could be like a week.. it could be 6 months. who fuckin' knows. back to the aimless grind i guess
everything will be ok, this was inevitable. the knife was just twisted a bit too deep so this is gonna be pretty hard for a while
im vaguing because im actually so intimated by the coldness i cant bring myself to message her
even just a "i hope you had a good flight" would have been nice? i guess? is that too much to ask from someone i want to keep a friend...?
come on, i wanna be your friend still like. show some humanity/compassion i guess. dont need to act so standoffish
still shaken about the uh.. coldness of it all, i guess. like i was just this fuckin pest she was glad to be rid of? idkkk
lifes in that weird tiptoeing-around-eggshells stage again, hooraaaaay
hmmmm
im not fucked up about the fact that it happened, im fucked up about the WAY it happened. once i recover from that itll be mostly fine
i cant speak for how ill do when i get home and im on my own again but if i just siphon all of this emotion into music i will probably be ok
i havent left the company of friends all day and its helped so so much. heartrate is still erratic and im anxious as hell but hey, yeah
i feel great now just because im with my friends and forgetting everything
might have to start seeing my psyche again.. fuck, i made so much progress, too. i hope i dont go that far back.
god i hope i dont lose too much weight over this. the last thing i need is to be cooped up in a hospital getting tube-fed
i need to eat but im finding it hard to find an appetite
my entire thought process is just "i'm sorry" over and over
@AmpyPony i dont really feel like talking about it, but thank you for the internet snuggles regardless, friend
last time i felt heartbreak it triggered a very slow spiral into crippling depression that ruined my life. who knows whatll happen this time
its so awfully cold this morning. not a nice cold. a lonely, bitter cold
now i cant even feel anything. i actually feel completely broken
its just weird thinking that just last week i was feeling better than id felt in a long time not just about life but being in love
augh why do i have to be up so early
@poniesaregay this is really cute, thank you
i need good horse fanfiction. or sanic fanfiction. i need something to read right now to distract myself. please help me
god and mums gonna decide its ENTIRELY her business when i break this to her and shell guilt me into telling everything. fuck that.
man, i have to be up in 5 hours. this is so rough.
@SheepyTina i do. i dont even wanna talk about why
man, i was already pissed about how directionless my life is and now ive essentially lost my compass
but you know what? i hurt you in ways i cant imagine. i deserve this, i think. im not sure if that makes this better or worse.
i dont hate you. i cant. i couldnt if i tried. i want to stay good friends with you. but tonight you have hurt me a lot
i mean you basically just used my trust as leverage to find someone who WASNT a burden and then just got rid of me suddenly before i left
im always afraid of being a burden on people. that is always my biggest insecurity. and that is now probably going to be even worse now
it just... that just targets all of my major insecurities at once
that one sentence has made this breakup MANY TIMES WORSE than it should have been
and why why WHY would you end your breakup speech with the equivalent of saying "oh yeah im gonna go to his house and fuck him tomorrow"
i apologise, followers, as youll probably see me go through all ot the stages of loss over the course of the night. right now were at anger
like, why not just break up with me when you really feel like you have to? instead of dragging me along until its more convenient for you
@TrentSinclaire yeah, im pretty peeved about that
i just feel pretty used i guess. idk.
thats what hurts most of all, i think. im just being thrown out because someone different, someone better than me is there now
i still feel angry that i was essentially baited into saying i was comfortable with polyamory so i could be replaced and dumped. not cool
fuck why cant i stop crying this is awful everything is awful
im sorry
god the fucking pillows smell like her still i cant fucking do this
@nishimikan @mechadraw HOLY DAMN
seriously though if any of you live in melbourne and want to say hi to a sniffly puffy-eyed me id like that
im gonna be optimistic and say this: record shopping in melbourne has been a blast. what a fucking stellar haul ive acquired
man, i swear more of you guys lived in melbourne lmao
@prism_lite no its ok, i feel a lot better after talking to my friends
@prism_lite lmao no its ok im fine
@prism_lite THESE ARE DEPRESSING ME LMAO
@SheepyTina its just such a funny phrase, like imagine reading that ten years ago
@Turboboost_25 if i ever manage to get my shit together enough to be able to drive ill totally join you hahah
theyre... theyre all i have
if i didnt have the friends i did i would have honestly just offed myself by this point. seriously. theyre everything to me
im so, so grateful for my friends. what the fuck. rhys wants to pick me up from the airport and just hang with me. i love them so much
why cant i just get a good job i like that actually gives me shifts so i cn earn money and move out and DO THINGS WITH MY MISERABLE LIFE
i just KNEW something was gonna go horribly wrong. everything was too good in the past two weeks for something big NOT to explode in my face
@poniesaregay lmao i dont even remember that. uhhh look idek who cares lmao
god idk, if we both were doing well on our lonesomes this would be a lot better for me but im just. so. jealous.
wow my twitter header is HORRIBLY ACCURATE
@poniesaregay me fuckin' too, dude. me fuckin' too.
i broke off with danielle and cut her out of my life because i made a tight-knit friend circle. now all i do is sit around home
@poniesaregay god i feel this so hard augh. my parents babied me so much and suddenly stopped at some point and thats... yeah
look this was going to happen eventually i think. but it doesnt make it hurt any less
she broke up with me because shes got a life outside of our relationship now. i dont.
and im so used to it that this is completely... well, ive got no fuckim idea what im gonna do now
im actually like, ok with not being with ella anymore specifically. its just... ive got nobody like that anymore now, thats all
i have a job, but i havent gotten a single shift ALL YEAR. and having failed high school my prospects arent exactly... a thing at all, rly
i mean, i have my friends. but im a total burden on them. i never have the money to do anything nice for them. they usually pay for me.
fuck i just wanna die in my sleep tonight honestly, it feels like ive got nothing left. and that really isnt far from the truth.
my entire transition to adulthood has been with her guidance and her assurance. now im left sorta high and dry i guess.
its just... augh, i was 17 when we started dating. wasnt even 17 for that long. now im fucking 20.
and i dont blame her, honestly. i wouldnt put up with myself. i DONT put up with myself
like the second she met someone who wasnt a pathetic piece of shit like me she was like "thank god im free from this fucking burden"
fuck whyd she have to say that i would probably be fine if it wasnt for... that
i wish i could look after myself. im so reliant on other people and it feels like thatll never change
no, actually, im going to drink water like a responsible person would
i'm uhhh. i'm going to go grab a soda from 7/11 or something. i guess
i just need a lot of hugs and some alcohol but all my friends are back home. melbourne isnt as nice when nobody you love is with you.
my sincerest apologies guys but my twitter will probably be pretty depressing for a while
fuck i just wanna be home
god i hate myself lol
great. so. now what. what do i do now
so my girlfriend of almost 3 years left me, i have to be up at 6 am and im now alone in a completely unfamiliar city all night. nice

thats not right, i mustve left my ds open with the game on for like an entire month or two lmfao
seriously though, this game's only been out for like... 6/7 months? i wouldve had to have played this for five hours every day... what

@shaliekjenkins if i ever come to america again im gonna hope youre performing somewhere close; ill go with morgan or something!!!

@shaliekjenkins whether or not that will ever go past a small newgrounds fanbase or whatever is entirely in the air but, eh
@shaliekjenkins your go-and-get-em attitude is driving me to work on this cartoon series ive had on the backburner for a literal decade
@shaliekjenkins i always knew you had success lying outside of banal internet fame and it really makes me happy that youre reaching for it
@shaliekjenkins i know we havent made a single interaction in 6 months but ive seen you come a long way in the past 3 years ive known you
@shaliekjenkins yo, i don't know where else to reach you so i'm just gonna message you here but like.. im super stoked for you

@aIbertjazeera i didnt bother because all the shit i wanted (mostly the venetian snares represses) were not available in this idiot country
@yessequitur idk, i want to map out all my aural memory synapses and shit because Im Autistic Top Kek but its not easy hahaha
@yessequitur the emotional attachment to each song is different? i guess? choices feels a bit more "the morning after" if that makes sense
i cant decide whether departure or choices makes me more emotional though? i mean, their memories are very much similar but like...
and that makes perfect sense but its still funny that any SMaNS-era skrillex song will make me more emotional than, say, massive attack
i think its mostly because that stuff is "alone listening" music, and when im out making memories with friends its usually happy music on
its funny, i dont have much emotional attachment to typically "emotional" songs; a large portion of my "good memories" music is the opposite
@yessequitur not to mention it really makes the whole album
@yessequitur point still stands, this song is super super emotional for me and will never not be
@yessequitur i mean, this is all very rose-tinted, most definitely, because there was a lot under the surface brewing but eh
@yessequitur just each other and everything we loved, esp. mlp + pokemon + bass music
@yessequitur but things were so, so simple back then, y'know? we all had all the free time in the world, no depression, gender dysphoria...
@yessequitur but it didnt matter, because we all had each other, really. and, well, we all still do to this day. minus billy, anyway
@yessequitur and the most incredibly life-changing and eventful school year was over and we were all just like... "what happens next?"
@yessequitur i just remember us all playing it on some cheap portable speakers at like 3 am somewhere in pac pines at some random park
@yessequitur and life was so good at that moment that it was like, the only thing i could call a "worry" at all
@yessequitur it just takes me back right to the end of 2011. i almost had a thing going with a girl i liked but i was too nervous
@yessequitur this song is gorgeous in its own right but the sentimental attachment to it makes it one of my all-time fave songs
man........ man, this song 
.@TheJob73370 O my god.

.@Roblox_Tips O My God. I Cannot Believe This.
@poniesaregay ur missin out! ;~)
@spacetwinks @icybutt well there you go, 1995 3d furry modelers were 15 years ahead of their time
@eccojammer yeah as much as i miss the influence of having 3.5k tumblr followers... well, i dont really miss it actually lmfao
@poniesaregay fair enough. gen 6 is stunning tho, theres no better time to get back into it esp bc things are very calm atm, nothing too new
@icybutt @spacetwinks they all seem very much like roblox... if not, this post got better because furries predicted roblox
@icybutt @spacetwinks could b wrong as i havent played it in 5 years but the wood textures + the way the rectangles and spheres are rendered
@spacetwinks @icybutt hm, this isnt 1995 i dont think... im pretty sure this was done in roblox!! earliest this image could be dated is 2009
i would go as far as to say that my love for pokemon is basically part of my identity at this point
it brought my high school friend group (of which i am still close) together, it... i dunno, its so fucking important to me like, spiritually
pokemons like... my interest in it waxes and wanes but my love for it is real and undying and it has been basically my entire life
@poniesaregay gen 5's pokemon are a close second to gen 3's imo, it gets a lot of flak but mostly from nostalgia goggle wearers
@netyaroze2 the last one i played was most wanted back in like 2007 or something, and that opened with shots of Sesy Babe like "hey hotshot"
@skiesofdelfinas i feel like because my name is whitney i should look into using miltank lmfao
@netyaroze2 dont need for speed still do the exact same thing to this day
@yessequitur annendum: i misspelt mawile as "froslass" on this list somehow, please disregard this egregious typo
@bestofideaot why didnt i put mawile in mine, what is WRONG with me
@Janmeeba mew is a very good choice though! although it's not much of a choice, is it? haha
@netyaroze2 every time i play minecraft i get reminded of the fact my username is flygon and i actually do a fistpump irl
@netyaroze2 flygon, blaziken, gardevoir, scrafty, whimsicott and froslass. chandelure is a close 7th
@SheepyTina ties are acceptable, chandelure is probably tied with froslass for number six on mine so
@yessequitur for the record mine are flygon, blaziken, gardevoir, scrafty, whimsicott and froslass
you can tell a lot about people by their six favourite pokemon. so, tell me, friends, what are your favourite pokemon?
@netyaroze2 yeah i bought it when it was in early alpha so not only do i have my favourite pokemon as my username i also only paid 15 bucks
@netyaroze2 minecraft gets infinitely more fun with modpacks that have too much aka just enough

yes, i need to lose weight, im 6"2 and i almost weigh 60 kilos?! thats Too Fat
this is the worst attempt at targeted advertising ive ever seen good try 
anyway uhhhhh im going to try and recreate sizzler toast using this recipe i found wish me luck
every time i get sick of a certain meal/food i actually mourn for its loss, thats how little i can eat
i cant afford to take ANYTHING out of it
but still, point stands, my diet is already Very Fucking Slim because fruit, vegetables, nuts, seafood etc are in a lot of things
if i stopped eating meat, my diet would consist entirely of two food groups, wheat and dairy. well, fatty foods is counted too sometimes
and if you try to make someone like that feel bad for not being vegan, sorry, but thats Pretty Fucking Scummy
people with various mental disorders/afflictions, people with dietary needs... there are many ppl out there who literally cant be vegan
look - vegans, you guys are cool, i admire what youre doing, keep it up - but PLEASE be mindful that not everyone is able to be one
@yessequitur my favourite response is "THATS NO EXCUSE", that and "YOULL GET USED TO IT"
@yessequitur "no like even if you put lettuce in a burger i can't-" "GET USED TO IT" "i'm underweight i can't just stop-" "DO IT ANYWAY"
@BATHSmusic YES LMFAO
@yessequitur "i cant actually eat any fruit or vegetables at all because my autism makes me overly sensitive to the textur-" "BULLSHIT"
why are vegans so ableist its the weirdest intersection but its so prominent i dont get it
with teeth is a superb album

@Half_Viv i was a force to be reckoned with; i had like 3.5k followers at my peak. then everything blew up and i got exiled the end lmao
@Half_Viv yeah. friendships come and go, people change, shit happens. trying to keep things rigid is a bad idea and makes everything worse
@Half_Viv they are, but i kind of like that. tumblr had too many overly-rigid cliques that always fell apart badly, this is chaotic but good
im not really very well-acquainted with many of you but i love you, weird loosely-attached-to-ytpmv twitter crew
the other guys are (if im correct) just chill dudes along for laughs. probs doing the photoshops. only irrelevant anrgyman is arguing

i get out of bed and theyve had guests over for lunch. they ate the cobloaf mum bought just for me. she said it was my fault; i was asleep
i'm like "what" and she's just like "well you're not getting up so" and leaves. the next thing i hear are two kids voices ive never heard b4

tfw ive got entire social theories in my head but when i try to put pen to paper it comes out as "uhhh transphobia is bad"
tfw you have a lot of things to say about social issues but youre autistic and find it really difficult to articulate a lot of said thoughts
@yessequitur ok im getting redundant already so im gonna stop, i cant quite articulate a lot of my thoughts on this very well :~(
@yessequitur idk, if it was a wide collective opinion amongst a very, very large majority of [minority] then its fine i suppose but... hhhhh
@yessequitur but when you throw other people in your minority under the bus just because certain issues dont affect you...? not cool
@yessequitur like... as [minority] you dont need to justify whether youre offended or not, because thats entirely out of your control
@yessequitur but it really steams me off when people in [minority] say that because theyre not offended that (vilification) is not offensive
@yessequitur i am jealous of people who are in a minority group and are not affected/offended by any sort of... vilification(?) or w/e
i... hmm, idk how to word these thoughts. lets give it a try
@DeadDigitizer @FeministAdolf trying too hard is what

@poniesaregay the art style is so fucking expressive its hilarious and adorable and fantastic
@EPTICDUBSTEP a much-appreciated rarity
@poniesaregay sigh
i dont even care, i love my current profile pic. its super cute and well drawn and if you replace the laptop with a desktop pc its fkin me
oh my goddd i love the sound design in table tennis by flying lotus
@WeirdBirdPal if anything theyre more oppressed really, like, my mum is in full favour of gay people but "doesnt believe in bisexuality"
@eccojammer its so bad that our speeds literally have to rely on "how close are their servers to us"
@Kaliibratiion &lt;3
@WeirdBirdPal plus its just pointless. like why argue about who is slightly more or less privileged when you can do... y'know, anything else
@NotFaulty GOD OMFGGGG WHAT
@YahooAnswersTXT @a_nice_frog
avalanches, flylo, massive attack on my playlist... icecream on my desk as i lounge back and just relax. it's a nice night tonight

@fussybabybitch luckily i had lots of fake plants and reflective wrapping paper to make up for it, almost messed up my "aesthetic" hehe ^_^
@fussybabybitch i know this may just be a picture of the seinfeld logo, but get this: its on a crt monitor. its retro, dude. windows 95 man
@fussybabybitch and get this, this gif here right, it has vhs artifacts, right, and
ive been going "i should make ytpmv id be good at it" for 7 years but never actually made anything which is probably a good thing but still
@Meelz93 hhgregg
@__rabbitgirl ill take your word for it... ive been slugging at this thing for 20+ hours now and its probably my brain just giving up LOL
@__rabbitgirl or should i change those gs into g#s
@__rabbitgirl idk, is this right? 
@__rabbitgirl man now the gs sound off-key... this is confusing
@__rabbitgirl actually yeah im switching it to a g, g# aint in the b minor scale so im playing it safe
@__rabbitgirl WAIT NVM ITS ALL GOOD APPARENTLY THERE WAS A DUPLICATE NOTE THERE AND IT WAS TWICE AS LOUD LMFAO
@__rabbitgirl it sounds all good up until the last chord, the g#4 sounds really off for some reason
@GayBagel KYLE DID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE HIM THE ACCOUNT OH MY GOD
@__rabbitgirl it looks like this! (can you tell i know nothing about music theory? look at these chords hahahaha) 
@__rabbitgirl what exactly do you mean by voicing?
@ammnontet what the fuck. the whole fingernail?
@__rabbitgirl ...going for something like this (30s in) 
@__rabbitgirl arghhhhh yeah ive been struggling with that for a while. it used to be a simple synth but it wasnt working so i tried...
@__rabbitgirl thank you! yeah, i was gonna clean up the think break but i was like wait... breaks were kinda gritty in '95 so i left it haha
i feel like this song needs soulful 70s vocal samples to complete it. or raggacore bullshit. either way
@yessequitur although im mostly looking for tips in composition, instrumentation, etc
@yessequitur obvs. this is still a very rough mixdown/master but don't be afraid to tell me if one element is too loud, too quiet, etc
ok this should work. you like jungle dnb? you know kk dnb from animal crossing? i need constructive criticism fam 
@__rabbitgirl really? wtf dropbox
opps wrong link
@djscratchin yeah i still have my fruity loops projects from 7 years ago. do you like clipping? i apparently used to love it
@VinnyVinesauce @angelfurn

@NerdbotMk2 it was a daring move and i personally liked how it forced you to not rely on pokemon youve used before
@jab50yen you fight dungeons, online

@Burdmew haha yeah, i have autism and tagging everything is such a good stimming activity. its like popping bubblewrap
i still cant believe ive actually listened to a fairly sizable portion of said music
i still cant believe i once downloaded 120 gb of music in one weekend
@Burdmew ahaha, yeah. im still slowly going through and correctly tagging + adding album art to everything. it's a slow process but worth it
@Burdmew yo &gt;:~) keep in mind id have at least another 10000 or so if ALL the music on my pc was in my library 
@cockatielcutie we can be ultimate bird girls together, each being the ultimate in our respective species

@altandi2015 poor production??? whatttttt. arca + daft punk killed it
@altandi2015 also omfg your twitter name haha
@altandi2015 i loved it, but its defo not for everyone
like i dont just feel awful emotionally/mentally, even physically everythings a total sensory overload atm
i did not miss this horribly depressed feeling at all
i cant remember the last time i felt this fucking awful
@TrentSinclaire considering i often have to work with scale references i suppose ill have to, yeah ~_~
@TrentSinclaire also this is a cover/remix of a somg and the original lead doesnt have no chords, just a simple melody
@TrentSinclaire yeah music theory's lame but at the same time i have NO idea how to create or use chords basically aaaaaa
probably doesnt help i dont know shit about chord progression
@TrentSinclaire haha yeah most of my pianos are really cold lol. now to figure out good b minor chords ugh
@TrentSinclaire you are being very cryptic and is scaring me
@TrentSinclaire HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO PIANO
ok guya help me out. warm piano chords: how
@hackdSounds its just... bah. i cant sleep unless im REALLY tired and i only get really tired during the day (i have a nocturnal rhythm)
@hackdSounds it frustrates me so much because itd help me so much but if going to a party or whatever meant being super tired for ages... :/
@hackdSounds i like... ive wanted to start one of those for so long but missing a sleep fucks you up real bad and hhhhhhh
GODDDDD THIS IS NOT GOOD
NO NO NO NO NO NO NO THIS IS FUCKING STUPID MY CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IS ACTUALLY FUCKED FOREVER
WAI TWHAT THE FUCK ITS ALMOST 4 AM
i feel like i really should make a twitter account for venting non-sequitur garbled horseshit at

if you think im just spamming these i am being SELECTIVE with what i pose. there are many entire pages filled with this exact content

the internet has reached its apex. it no longer needs to exist. it has fulfilled its purpose 

i... i don't know what to say anymore 
someone sat down, found these images, created this and published this to the public domain

@generalmumble thats like hp lovecraft level writing compared to a lot of other ragga-vocal driven music lol
theyre so... haunting
i absolutely fucking adore the timbre of bassy notes being played by a cello
@altandi2015 very good movie
@Personfaces photorealistic photorealistic blood
@SilvaHound im honestly so impressed with this though, like. that is some crazy good sentence mixing lmao
@poniesaregay ahhh yes i can sympathise with that haha
@poniesaregay like, if you were a total stranger id probably just ignore you or tell you to look it up yourself but idk, i like helping pals
@poniesaregay its ok! although, it is a good idea to look up a lot of this stuff yourself first haha
i like being queer. its fun and cool
@poniesaregay it is, it's a pretty cool orientation to have imo :~)
@poniesaregay we dont "see" gender in people i guess? it's not like "wow what a cute girl" or w/e its more like "what a cute person"
@poniesaregay pan means "all", i.e. attraction to all gender identities. pansexual people like myself typically dont uhh...
@poniesaregay namely in intersex people (people who dont fall into the biological sex binary)
@poniesaregay binary refers to the gender binary i.e. male, female. there are people whose gender identity lies outside of that binary
@poniesaregay but there are people who are homosexual but heteroromantic, panromantic and asexual... it goes on
@poniesaregay like, id say im pansexual but im biromantic (attracted to nonbinary folk and girls romantically)
@poniesaregay nope! completely seperate. some people (such as myself) even have differing sexual/romantic preferences
@poniesaregay yeah!! youd address a trans girl like youd address any other girl, and vice versa for trans boys
@poniesaregay my gender isn't "trans girl" if that makes sense. my gender is female/girl, but i happen to be transgender
@poniesaregay well, my gender identity is female, so i'm a girl (no "pretend"! watch that word, has nasty implications)
@poniesaregay a trans boy is a male identifying person who was assigned female at birth and vice versa
@poniesaregay uhhhhh there are a lot of ways to respond to this bc there are so many different contexts etc. elaborate?

@altandi2015 someone's gotta do it
@daikuzaibatsu and it's important for that stuff. drum and bass etc. NEED nicely compressed snares so they punch through the mix better
@daikuzaibatsu well of course. compression can be used to give things a different dynamic, whether that be a total lack of one or not aha
@cockatielcutie i also got followed from a "blogger from jakarta" very nice selection tonight
@cockatielcutie out of all accounts that could follow me after this 
@cockatielcutie mixtape, soundcloud, free download, torrent, free music, uhhhhhhh album, single, ep, new release,

@yessequitur i am completely out of my comfort zone but i think thats why this sounds so good to me; its so... different
@yessequitur ...have a nice life, clipping., phuture doom, future sound of london, and ends on the same song it begins with
@yessequitur literally... it starts with godspeed you black emperor, then goes to the bug vs earth, then fuck buttons, tim hecker...
@yessequitur and yeah, rather than just edm/drum and bass/other easy to mix genres this is industrial dance music with lots of drone/ambient
@yessequitur the whole mix has a particular "theme" to it; ive tried to tell a story entirely through other music.
so im putting the finishing touches to a mix... but not just some edm mix or w/e. something completely unlike anything ive done before.
@7thElementMusic huh. ive known you for years but im pretty sure this is the first photo ive ever seen of you lmao
@ptna_ 

[Dre chokes back the tears... They hadn't forgotten, they hadn't forgotten at all]
@eccojammer hahaha ive never even been there. im in brisbane myself and i go to melbourne occasionally but adelaide? nah
@eccojammer yo you live in aus? whereabouts?
me: get out of my mentions
officer: excuse me?
me: dont @ me
@Personfaces GODDD HOLY FUCK

@daps_ebooks this is the best tweet ive read all year
@daps_ebooks UHHH @adapadapa OMFG
@daps_ebooks where is it? how does it affect me?
@daps_ebooks what about it?
@DeadDigitizer add me im purplefridge
@jolyisgay i played it on the very night it appeared having no idea what was going on, i cried like 3x
@daps_ebooks he does indeed!
@daps_ebooks well, saturday afternoon, but you were close. i slept well, yes, thank you!
@daps_ebooks good morning
@daps_ebooks oh... you always know just what to say daps
@daps_ebooks dont change the subject! i demand an apology!
@daps_ebooks i suppose you could, but youve been very rude to me today. apologise!
@daps_ebooks you tryna say i have problems? get outta here!
@daps_ebooks yeah i feel that. how's your day been so far
@daps_ebooks no, that wasnt me!
@daps_ebooks me too
@daps_ebooks hello daps, how are you
im gonna try itunes genius and see what it tries to cobble together out of my stupidly wide music taste
@poniesaregay yeah because theyre both gay LOLZ ^______^
@poniesaregay i spot three essential drum and bass compilations
@angelfurn :~/ ?
@poniesaregay and if it isnt its because it doesnt need to be
@poniesaregay in essentia: smaller file size, basically the exact same quality. average bitrate is close to 320 most of the time
@poniesaregay just about. should play in any modern mp3 player, really. older ones might have trouble parsing it but who cares
@poniesaregay the best quality variable bitrate mp3
@realrobbi @YouTube its one of their best kept secrets. its fucking gold
@realrobbi @YouTube this shit is so underrated its crazy. all of tim and eric's non-tv shorts and skits are fantastic. have you seen pipers?
its really just limitless stimming. i can fiddle with knobs all i want. it doesnt even have to sound conventionally good. its just fun
i dont even make noise music for it to be enjoyed by other people. i just really enjoy making it myself. good stress relief
aaaaaaand rendered in glorious 96kpbs mp3 for extra lossiness! sounds fantastically destroyed and data-hole-y
holy shit apparently that crash fucked up the latency severely... i wonder if i can record this spotty noise
@Meelz93 mixcraft master race because IT JUST RECOVERED ITSELF FUCK YES
or maybe not 
i just got a burst of inspiration to make some noise music. i think i will do that
@poniesaregay choice of v0, 320 and  lossless FLAC is like... fucking important. the big 3 are crucial really
@poniesaregay its a very far second though in terms of revenue, control over content + distribution... everything really
@poniesaregay fuck all of them everyone should switch to bandcamp
@angelfurn i love you, i hope you feel alright soon :-B
@angelfurn whats up?
@Hedgehogize Whitney
@angelfurn you alright? :~(
@Hedgehogize purplefridge
i hope i can produce enough variety of music to reflect even 10% of my music taste
my taste in music confuses me a lot tbh. the other day i went straight from this binary universe to chocolate wheelchair and i didnt notice
all amongst shit like skrillex and ed rush or whatever. idk. my taste is so obscenely diverse and death grips marked the beginning of that
now ill shuffle my favourites playlist and i get... animal collective, boards of canada, studio killers, fuck buttons, portishead...
like before them i used to listen to just a lot of edm and drum and bass and the like. maybe some aphex twin or flashbulb here or there
seriously getting into them marked an enormous divergence in my taste in music which im really grateful for. they rly opened my eyes (ears?)
its actually really annoying to me that death grips have become this stupid ironic meme. they're a fantastic art/music project &amp; i love them
@a_nice_frog like me and morgan
@adapadapa i thought so.. i downloaded a ton of ssl-related gems and reinstalled the existing ones with extra ssl stuff but nothing changed
@adapadapa i feel like it could be the fact that theres a space in the directort but hh 
@adapadapa yeah :~( i followed the tutorial pretty strictly and idk. gave me a runtime error locally and on heroku it just crashed :~(
@adapadapa i spent hours trying to make a fridge_ebooks for myself a few nights ago and it wouldnt work no matter what :~(

“Are you some kinda liberal?” Applejack accused.

“I’m Chris Hansen, I simply need to ask you some questions involving spike", he says.

It was like the time when she fought …

things i want to hear: freestyle rapping akin to clipping.'s intro tracks over birdman-esque improvisational jazz drumming
this song will always confuse and bewilder me whilst also blowing my mind (and subwoofer) 
@poniesaregay hmmmmm ok. ill keep him in mind i guess
