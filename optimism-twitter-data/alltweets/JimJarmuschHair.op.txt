.@pitchfork @lcdsoundsystem Of course he fucking is.
Is it FURY ROAD day yet?
Un film de Kevin Smith
@williambgoss "Je m'appelle William Goss."
@MarcoTexRanger @johnwarrender I call your mom [redacted]
@johnwarrender We call it THE ROAD WARRIOR.
@ASamanthaRae I WANT THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!
I almost wrote I sarcastic tweet about FURY ROAD but couldn't bring myself to do it. I am too hopeful and optimistic!
@jessecarp @spencenicholson I'm dead.
@jessecarp @spencenicholson No worries.
Here is my MAD MEN prediction and it's been the same for years: Don Draper becomes Dick Whitman.
@ldbahr Did you know it was going to originally be called THE NORTH FACE OF CHERBOURG?
@jessecarp @spencenicholson I hate I'm in this conversation.
@jessecarp @spencenicholson Even his daughter agrees they are bad!
@jessecarp @spencenicholson Your children will be embarrassed of you for expressing that opinion.
@spencenicholson @jessecarp Sorry I expressed an opinion to you! Not like I'm pissing on people for liking them.
@Bwpachinger @jehawks I mean, I like all those movies but he did go from JAWS to ET.
@spencenicholson @jessecarp Have I been vocal about this? I just don't like the band.
@Bwpachinger @jehawks WAR OF THE WORLDS is great too!
@Bwpachinger @jehawks I remember when people tried to convince themselves the last 20 is a cryogenic dream.
@Darbmilne He is a v good filmmaker.
@jehawks I don't buy into that.
MINORITY REPORT is super underrated.
@devincf I just jelq
@somebadideas The person who read the script.
@Bwpachinger We are doing this togettee
@BrianDuffield @devincf @kristapley Guys, don't squash my hopes and dreams. ENTOURAGE is going to be great.
@somebadideas @SidizenKane I did a double of it and BEYOND last night. That movie is pure cinema.
Respond if yur not scared
@AndyRossTheBoss @robfee 
I never know how to handle Uber drivers who are racist and sexist. It happens a lot.
Also, he called contestants that select categories out of order "dickweeds"
One thing I learned today: Alex Trebek once tried cocaine.
MALLBRATS is about the sausages you can buy at the mall.
@brandonRohwer NO!
@BrianDuffield I think you might have screwed up here.
.@uhnet I saw her do it!
@pattonoswalt She hasn't blocked you yet?
@mtgilchrist Thunderdome is great!
@mtgilchrist I forgot how it's tries to be LAWRENCE OF ARABIA at one point.
@mtgilchrist Yeah, there's not a bad shot in there.
I cannot lie that it's almost HOOK-ish at times.
I like BEYOND THUNDERDOME. It might be on a purely cinematic level, though.
"I don't want those kids in my life." -@uhnet on MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME
.@uhnet She is correct!
@Hendyhendel Yeah, that is what I'm looking for.
@Hendyhendel @tut___ I'd love to see it with all you guys on Thursday!
@BrianMaxMann It looks like a young man's film!
@tut___ I can't believe we are seeing this week!
@BrianMaxMann ROAD WARRIOR is one of my favorite movies ever.
@mattnotis No you don't.
I won't believe FURY ROAD is as good as I hope it is until I see it.
@BrianMaxMann I am so happy this movie might be as good as I hope it is.
I won't donate to Orson Welles' final film unless he gets final cut.
@bradmiska We are both hurt.
@bradmiska Oh come on!
@bradmiska Kevin Love?
@bradmiska Kyrie is hurt and that's killing us.
@bradmiska like I said, both teams look dead.
@bradmiska I'm trying to be nice.
@bradmiska Come on dude. You got so many lucky calls. Don't be a poor loser.
@bradmiska No.
YESSSSS!
@bradmiska Does anyone on the floor look healthy?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!
@kristapley Will I still look cool?
Can I sink up my Apple Watch with my Google Glass?
How about we quit taking threes?
@kristapley I did MAD MAX: FURRY ROAD yesterday.
@kristapley It's twitter. Who cares?
@kristapley Good joke, bro!
DON'T TURN OVER THE FUCKING BALL!
@365HorrorMovie Gasol is out!
Go Cavs!
MAD MEN finale prediction: They are all chopped down by the world's largest lawnmower.
Please follow my new favorite account @CoachNBC!
Don't forget that tomorrow is National Frank Coraci Day!
@williambgoss woof
@somebadideas she would be the first to admit she doesn't know how to use it.
@somebadideas She doesn't know how to use it.
I really want to know ho watched THE OTHER WOMAN on my HBO Go account.
@sarah_sprague You will get to see me, though!
Happy Mothers Day, Mom! 
@EricVespe @EricDSnider Who are the two other guys?
@DrewAtHitFix That movie fucks me up.
@mrbeaks Ohhhh. What is it?
@fifisexorama I probably won't make it!  Thanks for the invite.
Dunkaccino! 
@doloresquintana Ed
@ThatDonLewis Ed Balls
Ed Balls
@BradMaurer Are you going?
Dunkaccino
@denniswidmyer Yes, but it's because I always forget my username and password.
@Hendyhendel @hedofthebloom @Nickrob it's right across the street from my old place in Echo.
@Hendyhendel @hedofthebloom @Nickrob Lost Knight. I got the name wrong.
@hedofthebloom @Nickrob I can imagine. I went to Barragan's many times.
@sarah_sprague Those airports are basically designed for that.
@hedofthebloom I hear it's huge.
@hedofthebloom White Knight? Not yet.
@timothycsimons thank you for the tweet
@kristapley @cagesideseats I'll probably be fired some day for quoting his poem about a boner.
@jessecarp 
@jessecarp He's kind of great in it. He actually tries!
I feel #blessed to have lived during the age of nu metal.
@mattnotis I'm sometimes drink Jagermeister!
@jessecarp I don't know if it was supposed to be.
@hedofthebloom Thank you! I think you are p cool!
I have soooooo many JACK &amp; JILL questions.
I'm v excited to see Al Pacino at @cinefamily today!
@hedofthebloom EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a v good movie.

#NationalMiniatureGolfDay @cyndilauper 
@hedofthebloom You have seen the Special Editions before?
@hedofthebloom I agree. I do love that Lucas adds a little more Jizz to ROTJ.
@hedofthebloom But Han is in no position to cause physical pain to Jabba.
@hedofthebloom Also, it makes no sense for Han to step on his tail.
@mattsinger I once saw a kid accidentally read a CVS receipt at his Bar Mitzvah.
MAD MAX: FURRY ROAD
@mattnotis I love Twizzlers!
@jakefogelnest Congrats, Jake. They know you're in the industry!
Remake culture is getting out of control. I can't believe HBO is remaking THE LATE SHIFT.
@katiewalshstx I'm just kidding. I love CLIFFORD.
@katiewalshstx That's what happens when you watch CLIFFORD.
@Bwpachinger @jehawks also, be careful Hawks, Brian is famous for being bad at wiping.
@Bwpachinger @jehawks this makes me want to vomit.
Hey @Marvel, this is how you handle Spider-Man. 
@GWBiscuit He's not good looking enough to play Leno.
@vhsbutt That's a #record
@jehawks @Bwpachinger This is a really disturbing image.
Jay Leno wanted George Clooney to play him in THE LATE SHIFT. That is not a joke.
@jehawks @benmiller He is the master.
@benmiller Go back to jelqing.
.@VICE This is why I quit smoking.
Colleen Green! 
@tbonebrisket Why is Austin Rivers the best player ever?
SPACE JAM 2 WITH AUSTIN RIVERS!
@365HorrorMovie Austin Rivers!
@tbonebrisket He is the best player ever.
@colleengreen420 You are great! Thank you for having me. 
I must say @colleengreen420 is incredible!
@colleengreen420
@MelissaStetten @AustinRivers25 whoa
@fifisexorama maybe I will!
@fifisexorama let me try one
@colleengreen420 Should I head that way?
@colleengreen420 Andrew Woods
@colleengreen420 yes
@BrianUdovich Sports are for dumb dumbs, Brian!!
Cavs/Bulls going to 7. I'm done trying the reverse jinx.
Ugh.
We lost
Fuck
@Bwpachinger Reverse Jinx, Brian.
Cavs are going to lose this.
Early Cavs fan! 
@michelledeidre I'll go to that.
@bdgrabinski @Nickrob this is a good tweet
@michelledeidre I've never been to The Mayan.
@michelledeidre Might want to check that out. I might be totally wrong.
@michelledeidre I think it's sold out.

@dannymears My favorite tweet ever.
@EvanDickson What now?
@HanaMichels 8
I'm going on a hunger strike until BACKSTROM comes back!
The world ain't beautiful without BACKSTROM in it.
@MarcoTexRanger @TheAmyNicholson Marco, we've both seen the picture and know that's not true!
@EricDSnider #hottake
Used to be one of the rottens and I liked you for that
@benmekler I'm sorry :(
@benmekler I don't actually have time right now.
@benmekler Record shop in Echo Park.
@benmekler They probably have some at Origami.
@sarah_sprague I'd rather see you hug a jaguar.
@uhnet @CheesyNuggets That movie makes me want to hug my dad.
@ThaneEconomou It comes out June 3rd, Thane.
In less than a week we will all have the ability to watch MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and the world will be a more beautiful place.
@mattysumida @HuginsPL @devincf @JayCamper TINTIN was Spielberg having more fun than we've seen him have in a decade.
@devincf That means they're bored.
@EvanDickson @devincf @MikeEvafal Spielberg is still great!
@EvanDickson @devincf @MikeEvafal Think of Woody Allen and you'll start to have a migraine.
.@amoebamusic @mymorningjacket This is during the Cavs game. I know someone who can't be happy about this!
@MisterMcCracken Sometimes it's New Order's "Ceremony"
Wolf Parade's "I'll Believe In Anything" might be my favorite song. I know that's crazy.
@MarcoTexRanger You were a lucky young man!
"Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)" is my favorite Grandaddy song.
I would call the Robert Durst candy Pee-z
@JoeMande He loves you too.
I'm starting a Kickstarter to fund my Robert Durst flavored candy.
@kristapley @DrGMLaTulippe 
Do you think you peepee and poopoo in heaven?
@Nickrob I've been shipping them for years.
@GWBiscuit They made nice.
@hedofthebloom I know they asked him.
@brockwilbur I respect Bob Hoskins! (RIP)
So is Leno going to be on Letterman?
@brockwilbur No one has to apologize to you. You knew exactly what you were getting into.
@uhnet Oh Henry! is a real candy bar, uhnet!
@Bwpachinger @bedtimebonzob Yes, coming from the guy who says The Ramones aren't punk rock.
@hedofthebloom CLIFFORD is a masterpiece of film.
@Hendyhendel Might watch CLIFFORD.
@bedtimebonzob That's probable.
$20 if you can help me "get" Tame Impala.
@Hendyhendel Yes.
@jehawks I was in I'm From Barcelona.
Dear lord I'm listening to The Polyphonic Spree.
@high_tower Early Grandaddy!
@tut___ No Dick Assman :(
I wish Letterman would bring back Dick Assman for one of the final shows.
@Dilabar @brooklynnine9 Whoa.
@michelledeidre Nothing.
@jessecarp I love that movie.
@BBW_BFF I'd wear those.
@365HorrorMovie I wish!
Is Biff Henderson ready to retire?
Is world ready to accept FREDDY GOT FINGERED yet?
Actually, TRL was going to have a pre-taped week of episodes and the unexpected success of that video would reveal it wasn't live.
I also remember when Tom Green retired "Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)" from TRL so he didn't get in the way of 98 Degrees.
@mrbeaks @RileyStearns I bet he looked great!
@mrbeaks @RileyStearns Did you sneak down to see 98 Degrees?
Just a reminder that Korn's "Got The Life" was the first music video retired on TRL.
@sarah_sprague @jon_bois @devincf @mrbeaks I always want to talk about Korn.
Excited for the Wachowskis show but it's weird that it's advertised as "from the writer of THE CHANGELING"
@ThaneEconomou @Bwpachinger @MarcoTexRanger Eddie Murphy wrote a song about me!
@MarcoTexRanger @Bwpachinger @ThaneEconomou MEESA JAR JAR BINKS!
@Bwpachinger @MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou But yes, I actually did forget about THE PHANTOM MENACE. I don't know how.
@Bwpachinger @MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou That's not a franchise. It's a religion.
@MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou JARHEAD came out in 2005.
@dannymears @CarterSwan I'm embarrassed by how much I'm laughing at this.
@MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou MI2 came out in 2000 but I don't think anyone considered it a franchise yet.
@MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou The biggest franchise around that time was probably Batman and that had been gutted three years before.
@MarcoTexRanger @ThaneEconomou Well I did say barely a thing...
@ThaneEconomou Franchises were barely a thing back then.
Why hasn't a filmmaker ever used M83 in a movie?
Costner is spitting fire in this scene. 


@RepTheBruiser 
@RepTheBruiser Remember Kevin Costner's accent in THIRTEEN DAYS?
@JakeMckay I didn't see that one in theaters!
Some of these movies make WILD WILD WEST look good.
@johnwarrender Yes.
I saw all these movies in theaters. Also CHICKEN RUN, ME, MYSELF &amp; IRENE, SPACE COWBOYS, DINOSAUR, THE PERFECT STORM, THE PATRIOT
@johnwarrender I need to see that movie again.
What a shitty summer!
Movies that came out summer of 2000: BATTLEFIELD EARTH, SHAFT, X-MEN, TITAN AE, HOLLOW MAN, GLADIATOR, MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2
I just remembered I saw BATTLEFIELD EARTH in theaters.
@alonelikmacauly @kbiegel @DrewAtHitFix I saw it in theaters! I was 13.
@Nickrob Ahhhh Periscope. How I miss it.
HOT PURSUIT tonight, anyone?
@benmiller @MarcoTexRanger It doesn't say I'm banned. I just get a loading error and it won't work. I've emailed them multiple times.
@MarcoTexRanger @benmiller Yeah, told people it was from Avengers 2
@MarcoTexRanger @benmiller Wolverine
@benmiller I'm banned from Periscope.
.@carlquintanilla @DavidPoland The Kaleburglar
That Cavs video is pretty disgusting.
David Chase on TWIN PEAKS. 
@MarcoTexRanger damn skippy.
@MarcoTexRanger The owner and his buddies had just won a chili cook off. That was there trophy. They were also smoking cigars.
@MarcoTexRanger This is another time. All times at Tiki Ti are great!
#tbt to a time when Tiki Ti was open. 
Pizza Lunchables were only good if you put them in the microwave.
I just lost $5 to @uhnet about an Oh Henry candy bar.
@Roberta_Glass I don't want to gossip about this.
@Roberta_Glass @salesonfilm looks like a little kingsman to me.
@Roberta_Glass @salesonfilm No.
@MarcoTexRanger @FilmCritHULK one more time! 
@FilmCritHULK I know what Hulk really loves!
@tbonebrisket bye baby dick!
#MyDickIsLikeAClown because it's hidden away like a lost Jerry Lewis film.
@high_tower I NEED TO DO THIS!?!?
@high_tower WAIT WHAT!?!?
@MarcoTexRanger @vhsbutt I still haven't seen the final cut of that.
@MarcoTexRanger @somebadideas @FilmCritHULK Does Betty know about the cement mixer?
@MarcoTexRanger @somebadideas @FilmCritHULK Is it painful when your dick shrinks while it's still stuck to the cement?
@MarcoTexRanger @somebadideas @FilmCritHULK Are there bits of cement still on your dick?
@MarcoTexRanger @somebadideas @FilmCritHULK How did you get you dick out of the cement mixer? Are you THAT strong?
@FilmCritHULK Why did you have sex with a cement mixer?
You win some and lose some. Some nights you do both.
@williambgoss Rivers Cumo.
Austin Texas was named after Austin Rivers.
Austin Texas should pay for Austin Rivers!
Fucking Austin.
@samdzimmerman There is a Los Campesinos! cover I really love!
@samdzimmerman Untitled
@benmekler The Applebees in Alhambra
@samdzimmerman Voyeur
@samdzimmerman Apparently you've never heard "Josie" by a little band I like to call Blink-182
@benmekler I'd do it!
@michelledeidre @benmekler That's my mom's birthday.
@benmekler Your mom's house.
Fuck.
@yarafigueroa @ilazer @abbijacobson They're the best.
@iamchoppah You are always about three minutes behind.
Sling is horrible for watching basketball.
@HanaMichels Well, you literally did that to me.
I know it's halftime but that Houston stadium looks shockingly empty.
@365HorrorMovie Just saw it!
I love Blake Griffin so much.
@EvanDickson I don't want to lose it and Tiki Ti!
@brockwilbur I want to cry.
@Bwpachinger I'm sorry I have feelings about a place I have beautiful memories about.
@EvanDickson It's an amazing show. I love it so much.
@EvanDickson @BrianWCollins Good joke, Evan. I'm proud of you.
I love the Cavs!
@Hendyhendel I like that diversity!
Every single one of my friends lost their virginity at Tiki Ti.
@katiewalshstx @benmekler it's closed indefinitely.
The great @benmekler took me to Tiki Ti for the first time on my 25th birthday.
Quit closing my bars on me, LA!
@sarah_sprague 
The owner of Tiki Ti once won a chili cook off and his buddies drank out of the trophy while smoking cigars. 
LA isn't LA without Tiki Ti.
NOT TIKI TI!!!!
@kristapley You'll be back on board once they tackle the Clone Saga!
@NordlingAICN @houstonalamo I'll do it for you then.
@NordlingAICN @houstonalamo Get drunk.
@DrewAtHitFix Not even this trailer? 
Oh thank God.
Go Cavs!
@mrbeaks This is some good CASTLE.
Lorenzo Lamas' Oil
The first year I went to FYF the ticket was $35. This year it is $180.
Where is @ShadesMcHwood when you need him?
My boy @joaqspoblete just made a great point. Is FYF going to be vegan this year for Moz?
50 Shades of Hamburglar
@ccrobertson75 @devincf Don't forget KISS, Batman and Robin!
@MarcoTexRanger They failed to mention that the dogs are also explosive experts...with itchy fingers.
There will be a movie set in the McDonald's Universe. Eventually there will be one a year.
@ThaneEconomou Too low brow for me.
@ThaneEconomou Not done with that joke, huh, Thane?
I think its an odd choice made by McDonalds to give The Hamburglar a constant erection.
@MarcoTexRanger WTF?
@mtgilchrist @MarcoTexRanger Leave my love alone.
Activist: "You look like an ocean person."
Me: "Not really."
Activist: "Rain forest?"
Me: "Not really."
@devincf @jhoffman It's still better than that shitty Transformers movie.
@FilmCritHULK What is wrong with you? 
I was excited about FYF until I noticed they jacked the price up by $50.
@high_tower As much as I love Michael Sheen, I'm afraid he did not give life to Charlie and Emillio. You're thinking of Martin.
@high_tower That was a reference to a man named Charlie Sheen. You should look it up.
@high_tower #winning
@johnwarrender The only person who is actually hot enough for TV is Jeff Wells.
Amy Schumer is the best.
@Nickrob @xymarla @theawesomeshow What do you guys have against Kevin Nash?
@jlichman Did you like Avengers 2? 
@MarcoTexRanger @devincf Marvel really fucked us this time.
@MarcoTexRanger @devincf I think this is the cut scene Devin wrote about last week.
@devincf What about this? 
Who wants to go see The Garbage Dick tour with me?
@mrbeaks You're missing all the best parts!
@jlichman I heard he woke up and his penis immediately turned to dust.
@mrbeaks Did you ever finish it?
.@jakefogelnest @vpfavale Call into Stern every day.
@devincf CONSTIPATED HULK
@sarah_sprague The Jeff Wells report?
OMG! Will @Nickrob go see Morrissey with me? 2015 is a miraculous year!
GODDAMNIT! I love the FYF line-up but it's in the same location as last year :(
@TheAmyNicholson @devincf @superherohq @mtgilchrist @EvanDickson But it won the hearts of America!
I'm sorry Nick DiPaolo.
"Playing the role of Jeff Wells tonight is Nick DiPaolo."
@jlichman What if Wells pooped his pants?
@jlichman I know this is true but a person can dream.
Last night's INSIDE AMY SCHUMER feels like it was made for Jeff Wells.
@ASamanthaRae JO'ing
"Say It Ain't So" is perfect. How could you argue that?
@worldbofree you're okay
Shittiest emo night ever! 
@somebadideas @SidizenKane @ManMadeMoon I've heard that's true of everyone that went to Wooster.
@somebadideas @SidizenKane @ManMadeMoon drunk "ripped" or amazing physique "ripped"?
@SidizenKane @somebadideas @ManMadeMoon That will make Clipper Daryl very sad.
@somebadideas @ManMadeMoon I love basketball. I hate the Lakers. Tickets are sometimes cheap. They're good. Still love the Cavs.
@brockwilbur Why are you dead inside?
AMERICAN PIE 2 is a masterpiece of American cinema.
I love @emonightLA but I'd kill for a Jizz Night LA!

@fifisexorama No.
@fifisexorama I like the beer part.
@BrianMaxMann in the sequel he has to go through hell. THE FAMILY KIDNEY STONE

@high_tower You wouldn't want Shaq to be #family?
@ThaneEconomou Only person who uses him anymore is Sandler.
Honestly, why isn't he in the F&amp;F franchise?
@brandonRohwer I just pitched an amazing Shaq movie to a few of my friends.
More movies with Shaq please
@houx You lucky duck!
I wish I was a doctor so I could give all my patients lollipops! 
Matty B should play Spider-Man.
@somebadideas @ManMadeMoon The other day Aaron told me he didn't even know what sport the Clippers play.
@sarah_sprague You guys don't like ranch with your pizza?
@sarah_sprague It doesn't have sauce on it. It's basically just breadsticks with a bunch of dipping sauces.
@sarah_sprague They did and renamed it The Big Dipper Pizza.
@sarah_sprague Look what I'm trying! 
.@pizzahut Do you know beautiful you are?
You haven't done it until you've done it in a Pizza Hut.
@EvanDickson @RileyStearns Yeah, my assistant fucked up.
@EvanDickson @RileyStearns You set them up, I know them down!
@EvanDickson @RileyStearns Does that mean you bought it with pizza?
MAD MEN ends with Don becoming David Letterman.
@Hendyhendel I think the show has refined his skills.
@Darbmilne John Slattery?
@Darbmilne Jon Favreau?
I bet Martin Freeman plays Iron Man.
I've been out of college for almost five years now so I can finally say that Ultimate Frisbee is the stupidest thing that's ever existed.
@jamesfflynn I don't think that was it. Rex? Rob? Ron? Tubbo? Checkers? Cheeks?
How about that Shia LaBeouf Indiana Jones movie? What was his character name? Muff? Kiff? Spliff? Jackson? Mutt? Max? Ruff? Bob?
@davidehrlich <FLUSHED FACE>
This piece on rejected Letterman bits and jokes is amazing. 
@brandonRohwer Max Rebo&gt;Kurt Cobain
Mark Hamill used to tape every one of Letterman's shows during the early NBC years.
A  LAPD was busted for insurance fraud after she was caught on film doing the ice bucket challenge. 

I love watching local news.
@roxanne73 IHOP
This Letterman special could have used more Zevon.
I've never existed without David Letterman doing his thing.
One time the mob wanted to take out Johnny Carson. True story.
I like the part of the David Letterman special that was set to Katy Perry.

(Not making this up)
They forgot to take a picture of me at the #MetGala. I wore a sock.
@Darbmilne What would irony be without him?
@Darbmilne Letterman is one of the most important figures of comedy of the last 40 years.

@brockwilbur When we start going after Whedon for misogyny, I need to bow out of this conversation.
I actually like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON the more I get away from it. There is some smuggling going on in there.
@dannymears @devincf The thing is I think that final scene between Ultron and The Vision kind of does it.
@devincf Devin, unless a character in a movie explicitly tells you the theme, you're reaching.
@alonelikmacauly @sarah_sprague jar jar is cool.
Derrick Rose will probably hurt himself brushing his teeth tomorrow.

@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson You know if you see good foot first that means you'll have good luck that day, right?
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson I love good foot.
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson I kind of liked when they just served sandwiches.
Everyone check out My Morning Jacket's THE WATERFALL. It's some good shit.

or maybe they made another one of those RESIDENT EVIL movies.
Are we sure that isn't from THE WALKING DEAD?
@devincf @Nickrob is all in now!
@Bwpachinger @sarah_sprague you could buy more furniture for us to destroy!
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom The way boys use her like a drive-thru?
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I like the burgers from Del Taco!
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson watch your mouth!
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom In-N-Out and Fatburger don't count?
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson I want to try out Mo Better Burgers.
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson May I suggest a place called McDonalds.
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson Been there.
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson It's v cool. I get hard every time I use it.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I'll send that email right now.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I'm banned!
@Bwpachinger Thank you. I had actually forgotten how to spell the word so that was v helpful.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I want that burger that has 9 patties.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I will have Hache then!
@Bwpachinger Why are you mad? This seems v helpful for you.
I totally forgot David Oyelowo was in INTERSTELLAR.
@Bwpachinger Jenna is going to murder you.
@Nickrob Nah, I am still waiting for a reply to my email.
@jlichman I sent them a nice email explaining I have the best Periscope account and banning me is a disservice to the people.
@jlichman All I did was say I had some awesome Avengers 2 stuff to show and they got a little Wolvie dong. I haven't been able to log on.
@hedofthebloom I take it that I must.
@hedofthebloom Have not.
.@HumanPog @redrobinburgers I hate that. Bottomless fries my butt!
I'm all about that granddad bod.
UPDATE: Still banned from Periscope because of the gif.
@jessecarp Warner Bros. I have a pitch you can't ignore...
It's pretty horrible.

Has anyone tried Wayback Burger yet?
@365HorrorMovie u mad bro?
@365HorrorMovie ;)
@scott325 I just don't see it drawing in a huge audience.
@GWBiscuit Who doesn't?
Imagine the ratings of a Warriors/Hawks finals.
@GWBiscuit You may have just changed my mind. I can imagine Curry and Boss Nass chilling.
Who actually roots for the Warriors? Such a boring team. It would be like rooting for milk and white bread.
I still haven't collected all of the My Little Pony Happy Meal toys yet!
Marvel, I have a pitch you can't ignore. The Avengers must face their deadliest foe yet: explosive diarrhea!
I find jokes about vaping problematic.
Droopy McCool and Kit Fisto walk into a bar...
Happy tenth anniversary SEPARATION SUNDAY! You're still my favorite Hold Steady album.
Austin Rivers should join The Avengers.
@sarah_sprague Cool dog, bruh.
@ldbahr Best theater.
BABE is an extraordinary movie.
BABE vs CHARLOTTE'S WEB
I think this OBSERVE &amp; REPORT screening at @newbeverly was the right choice.
I won! 
I'm v happy right now.
@GermainLussier How could you beat that?
This series has been some of the best I've ever seen.
THAT FUCKING HAPPENED!
I love basketball more than fuck.
@fifisexorama @originalfuzz smart move.
@fifisexorama @originalfuzz Funny cause my Uber Driver has been drinking nonstop.
CHRIS FUCKING PAUL!
Go Clippers!
@hedofthebloom I actually deleted this because I was afraid someone would try and say that. You using Tweetbot?
@outlawvern I'm more into classical Jizz.
@mrbeaks @kbiegel He would know!
@mrbeaks What?
Know what's in the Pope's bathroom? Holy shit.

;)
@Darbmilne this is my fifth time.
Watching INHERENT VICE again!
@jehawks Hey! I love Daft Punk all the time!
THE FORCE AWAKENS will have been for nothing if doesn't feature a little Jizz.
@outlawvern Did Max Rebo play Jizz?
@dannymears Looked good at Vista!
@tut___ how do you hack a loogie?
@brockwilbur I'm pretty sure your pants popped up a little!
COME ON, SPADER! 
@williambgoss He will die first.
@RaniaKhalek 
My everything! 
@andherestome they won at the end
Mayweather really is the biggest piece of shit, isn't he?
I'm not watching the fight tomorrow unless Mayweather finally reads a page of Harry Potter out loud.
@KarinaLongworth Call him Young Joc
I'm at Center for the Arts for Mikal Cronin in Los Angeles, CA 
@spencenicholson He must just saw AVENGERS.
I always forget how crazy small this venue is. 
@MisterMcCracken 10:40
@russfischer oh fuck me
@somebadideas @russfischer I jelqued in it.
@lurie_john @Bwpachinger @mrbeaks this is my favorite tweet ever.
@russfischer I guess I was trying to say he designed his own shots.
@russfischer Yeah, I know. I've been in that office before.
@ruthie06 @Bwpachinger no
I love that it sounds like George Miller had physical storyboards for MAD MAX FURY ROAD instead of it being just previs.
@mrbeaks @lurie_john blocked @Bwpachinger!
@Bwpachinger At the end of the day, who gives a shit.
@Bwpachinger I said I went in with low expectations and kind of dug it. I thought this was about me.
@Bwpachinger subtweet
@periscopeco Hi. I think I was unfairly banned.
@sarah_sprague @alonelikmacauly It seems like an album we'd both love.
I actually dug AVENGERS more than I thought I would. My expectations weren't that high. It's kind of a weird fucking movie.
The Format's DOG PROBLEMS is still a really good album.
I hope Stan Lee starts making cameos in non-Marvel movies!
Brett Ratner for Star Wars.
My favorite scene was where Thor ran around with his fists in the air screaming. "I am Thor! Hear my roar!"
@ThaneEconomou Boy howdy! Did they ever!
Yes, I will give you the answer to the question you've been dying to ask. I saw AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON.
@ASamanthaRae So is OLD DOGS!
Remember the Morton Downey Jr episode of Cribs?
My father is at the Kentucky Derby. I'm seeing a comic book movie. He's real proud of his boy.
Fine. I'll see it. I just won't pay $15. 
@kristapley What happened now?
@devincf @MarkHarrisNYC He still got paid well and they probably always made their day!
@jessecarp @spencenicholson That movie can go fuck itself silly.
@EvanDickson You mean LeBron isn't at Stanley? <WORRIED FACE>
Everyone should come see Wand and Mikal Cronin tonight!
@bedtimebonzob Eagle Rock Center of the Arts
Riot Grrl @uhnet! 
Sleater-Kinney! 
@bedtimebonzob You should see Mikal Cronin tomorrow night.
@bedtimebonzob Yeah.
@bedtimebonzob Maybe even more ambitious. Did you read the Grantland article?
@bedtimebonzob I love it. But that's my band.
@bedtimebonzob I'm here.
@bedtimebonzob Blah.
@EvanDickson Did LeBron like it?
Hey TNT, your production sucks.
@ASamanthaRae What does 


@EvanDickson @LeBronJames Nice of him to show up during playoff season.
@tut___ 
@tut___ Tour Your sister's expression is killing me.
Hack A Jordan is so gross.
@mrbeaks @DrewAtHitFix @BrianWCollins Man, I bet that got you laid!
@benmiller sorry
@Hendyhendel Me!
I don't think the Bucks are going to win this one.
Makes sense to me! 
I think Periscope banned me because of the @WuWw9.
@ldbahr CRIES &amp; WHISPERS is a laugh riot.
Everyone did great with their Periscopes today! Great job, gang! <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MisterMcCracken I want to ask him if he fucked the lonely whale.
The perfect dinner companions would be Neil deGrasse Tyson, Janet Reno and Adrian Grenier.
Anyone have $2500 they can lend me? 
Ah-nuld is live on Periscope!
@GriffLightning Enjoy!
@Nickrob I'll always have Droopy McCool.
@Nickrob I'll still have all the lowers cards. Those are all we need.
@GriffLightning Go ahead now.
@GriffLightning I have a good friend I'm going to give first pick. Then I'll accept it.
@GriffLightning Says it's no longer being offered.
@RileyStearns I hope your interpretation was "Tool sucks"
If anyone wants some Star Wars cards come get them from me. I'm done.
@365HorrorMovie @ToppsSteve 
@somebadideas It's funny because that's the sex number!

.@LCJReviews Whoa! Watch your language, LCJ!
Guys, we do not need a CAT'S CRADLE television show.
@benmekler SHUT IT DOWN!
@benmekler How do you make it a TV show!?!?!
@ndsinnott It's so accurate!
The internet is wonderful. 
@Hendyhendel @brandonRohwer @tut___ 
@jlichman I beat you to this. 
@brandonRohwer @Hendyhendel @tut___ 
@benmiller That's not too far off.

@Hendyhendel @tut___ I took my glasses off and it guessed 28.
@Hendyhendel @tut___ 42
@Hendyhendel @tut___ Guess what mine was?
@365HorrorMovie Here's my response to that: How old are you?
Sleater-Kinney tonight!
Titus Andronicus announced a 93 minute rock opera with 29 tracks so today is my Christmas and birthday.
Father John Misty can never return to The Thirsty Crow.
Rockin' my shame! 
@somebadideas @BBW_BFF Oh boy. That movie.
@BBW_BFF I liked it. It had a v good Ghostbusters joke in it. Other things too.
@BBW_BFF I win.
@MatthewPWells dirty boy
:) 
@CarterNixon Was it you?
@Dilabar @TheAmyNicholson @Dodgers Yung Joc!
One time I found the creepiest LIZZIE MCGUIRE fanfic. I'm pretty EL James wrote it.
PTA pays Jonny Greenwood in red zip-ups.
@GriffLightning @davidehrlich He's in LA right now I think. At least he was when he dropped that letter off at Joni Mitchell's house.
@benmiller please quit talking to me on here
.@ArcLightCinemas Thanks!
I watched the six-minute of deleted scenes and shots from INHERENT VICE and it's better than anything I've seen this year.
@Joeyaucoin Bloom kills himself at the beginning. Movies over.
@Joeyaucoin ELIZABETHTOWN
@Joeyaucoin I have a very easy solution to fix that movie.
@tbonebrisket good tweet.
@TheAmyNicholson @devincf ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@TheAmyNicholson @devincf Periscope is awesome.
@misterpatches Great movie.
@fernhh I was joking because they are playing it 48 times a day.
@fernhh Oh! Thanks! 
@Bwpachinger I'm afraid it might be a boring sucky.
ALOHA can never live up to ELIZABETHTOWN.
@mrbeaks Dammit.
.@ArcLightCinemas Will you have Avengers?
@dannymears Damn. So many options.
Does anyone know if Arclight Hollywood is showing AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON this weekend?
@dannymears Worked for me. 
I think WB should hire Joe Eszterhas to oversee their DC movies.
Remember how people were even more heartbroken when Leno finally retired? He was a true giant.
I can't stress enough how good @MikalCronin's MKIII is. He keeps getting better and better.
@brockwilbur Fine. I'll RT this.
@mattsinger to poke the condom with?
@mattsinger Is that a condom?
@RachaelPriorMBE You can always use PostMates!
@brandonRohwer I'd watch it.
@brandonRohwer One can only hope!
@brandonRohwer Was it with Jake Thomas and Lalaine?
@mrbeaks @MarcoTexRanger What's that?
@mrbeaks I know what you're thinking. Where's Gordo?
WHOA! 
Letterman is the best. Truly the best. 
@EvanDickson @mtgilchrist I just like to pretend to be one.
@EvanDickson @mtgilchrist I'm just fucking around.
@mtgilchrist @EvanDickson Fuck you. You should be standing and clapping for my brilliant ID4fans joke.
@EvanDickson @mtgilchrist This just makes you really bad ID4ans.
.@hermajestydrew You haven't seen me in years, Drew.
That joke is an old theater joke BTW. Please don't think I'm trying to take credit for it.
That's one of my favorite jokes ever.
The man replies pompously: “ ‘Neither a borrower nor a lender be’ —William Shakespeare.” The beggar looks at him. “ ‘F— you’ —David Mamet.”
So there’s this panhandler who approaches a distinguished looking gentleman and asks for money. (1/2)
@devincf Did you get both emails last night?
Just a reminder that this exists. Austin Rivers should be forced to watch it over and over. 
Fucking Austin Rivers.
@earnestp He did.
Over. Damn.
Can't miss those, Blake.
So @MarcoTexRanger is on Periscope and won't jelq for me!
@GriffLightning @midnight Broats.
AUSTIN FUCKING RIVERS!
@kristapley @mikeryan I'm excited for Stern's final appearance in a few weeks.
@mrbeaks @DrewAtHitFix @Nickrob @devincf Hogwash. You can't make CADSHACK III without Jackie Mason.
@DrewAtHitFix @Nickrob @devincf @mrbeaks and I saw him at the bar the other night.
@DrewAtHitFix @Nickrob @devincf VERONICA'S CLOSET is better than all of them.
Kiss Me Kate Upon #BroBroadway
Pops already bringing out the Hack A Jordan!
Shrek: The Musical #BroBroadway
Glad they showed an add for 19 KIDS during the Clippers game.
Holy cow! I just bought a ticket to see Al Pacino do a Q&amp;A for GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS at @cinefamily!
@Nickrob @troniks He's really great in that movie.
OMG! @MikalCronin has a cat named Stephen Meowkmus.
@BBW_BFF I've suspected this for years.
I will probably see AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON this weekend. #hottakes
.@dannymears I believe they did the same thing with MONTAGE OF HECK.
New @MikalCronin <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
I hope the DON'T LOOK NOW remake cuts back and forth between the sex scene and the dude jelqing.
@ThaneEconomou This is incredible.
@mtgilchrist @Nickrob He drove to her house to mail it.
@benmekler @ThaneEconomou Cap needs to get laid.
@GriffLightning @ucbcomedy 
@Hendyhendel Didn't they hate each other?
@bryanbenbailey @uhnet He ever tell you about the time he beat Shaq?
Has anyone checked the #AaronCarterHornyLevel lately? Does he know HD is on Tinder?
@uhnet that was written by the great @fart.
@uhnet 
I bet Aaron Carter has been on Tinder all fucking day.
@Hendyhendel Just a normie going bowling!
@Hendyhendel :(
!!!! 
@ThaneEconomou @benmekler I'm dying to know this too!
@ldmullen @TheAmyNicholson @mrbeaks @jamesrocchi @mattsinger @jenyamato There were a lot of Ponderosas in Ohio. Mom called it Pondegrossa.
.@CNNMoney WTF!?
@michelledeidre It's not exactly Los Feliz but really close.
@michelledeidre Yeah, I have friends that live there. That's Thai Town.
@michelledeidre I live in Los Feliz and love it.
@Joeyaucoin I think that actually is it.
@TheAmyNicholson You get a turkey?
Someone thought this was so funny they wrote it on a bathroom wall. 
NATIONAL TREASURE IS ON NETFLIX!
lol altruism.
@michelledeidre @PolarSeltzer no
HAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAHAHAHAH! 

Hawks lose.
I love that Atlanta is struggling with Brooklyn.
@EvanDickson Never mind. Not a fan of Ticketmaster.
@EvanDickson You get a $15 ticketmaster credit which would almost cover their bullshit up charges!
@Bwpachinger lol
How is @rembert right now?
@Bwpachinger The problem is Crowder also fell like an idiot and hurt himself even more.
@Bwpachinger No way in hell it would ever have been just one game.
@Bwpachinger We got lucky with JR.
@kbiegel Did they play their cover of "We Didn' Start The Fire"?
Do you think Lights Camera Jackson will review LOVE?
Josh Gad is going to be on Celebrity Jeopardy!
I'm seeing Sleater-Kinney this week!
@AdamFrazier Didn't MEN IN BLACK II already claim him as an alien?
Thank God JR Smith is only out two games.
There's an episode of RICHIE RICH where Richie starts dating a robot. The robot cheats on him with a vacuum cleaner.
@DrGMLaTulippe FleshLight is known for their excellent customer service!
This bad. 
Yesterday I found out I'm really bad at cotton candy.
I heard Jared Leto is getting into character by only drinking Faygo.
Meredith is the best character on MAD MEN.
@SamFragoso @katiewalshstx @somebadideas You can still design gorgeous competitions that benefit what you are trying to say with it.
@katiewalshstx @SamFragoso @somebadideas I totally agree. I'm sure a lot people were put off by CinemaScope when it was first introduced.
@katiewalshstx @SamFragoso It makes sense to me. Music videos are promotional tools.
@MisterMcCracken I'm doing Thursday.
@MisterMcCracken Which day are you doing?
@katiewalshstx @SamFragoso 
I was ten when Tim Duncan started playing.
@katiewalshstx It's just like MOMMY!
@katiewalshstx They've actually admitted it.
@katiewalshstx Instagram ready.
.@adriangrenier Gross, dude.
Olynyk is gross.
@michelledeidre No.
@michelledeidre You guys almost ripped off Love's arm.
@Hendyhendel everyone around me is saying the same thing.
Blake Griffin gets hit on the dick A LOT.
@michelledeidre I'm a Cavs fan so we shouldn't talk right now.
@michelledeidre Clippers
I think @Hendyhendel called a meatball a burger. He is now my mortal enemy.
@Hendyhendel Meatballs aren't burgers!
@Hendyhendel that's a meatball sub, John. I don't see any burgers on it.
Has anyone tried the lateral double cheeseburger from Burger King? Have we entered a new era of burger architecture?
Bye Celtics.
@williambgoss @DrGMLaTulippe Don't! I want him to have little LaTulippe Timbits running around his house.
@williambgoss @DrGMLaTulippe Start a kickstarter, Goss.
@williambgoss @DrGMLaTulippe $18? That's so worth it.
@DrGMLaTulippe I'll give you $10 if you fuck one of those donuts, Geoff.
@jakefogelnest @newbeverly They've asked you not to come, Jake.

(except they're doing the fist-and-gun backwards SMH Arianna) …
@BBW_BFF defense?
Will we have any players left for the Chicago series?
@Hendyhendel I hate it so much. "What is your self worth?"
Perkins!
@davidehrlich I bet you wish you had some Cookie Puss right now.
@kristapley @LAist Especially since I follow them for food related things!
Gad Tidings!
@davidehrlich At least you have leftover Fudgie The Whale, right?
.@LAist So happy to read this early on a Sunday morning!
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Please let that shoulder pop right back in place and be magically healed.
Go Cavs!
Yes, Amy Yasbeck still looks incredible.
The geniuses behind PROBLEM CHIKD 1 &amp; 2. 
Amy Yasbeck looks incredible.
I let @uhnet this filter. 
@williambgoss Country Goss
@mrbeaks @kbiegel Can we all agree Hanzi is the worst?
HOUSE OF CARDS is SCANDAL for faux-intellectuals.
@SidizenKane They still haven't done anything as good as Netflix's RICHIE RICH.
@hedofthebloom The Netflix original show.
Everyone needs to watch five minutes of RICHIE RICH. It will blow your mind.
@jlichman @brandonRohwer Second season comes out in May.
@brandonRohwer @jlichman Oh I know.
@brandonRohwer @jlichman He has a sex robot.
@MisterMcCracken Just what they were doing with that casting makes me laugh out loud every time I think about it.
@brandonRohwer I can't wait to talk more people into watching this.
SMALL WONDER is a better show than RICHIE RICH.
@davidehrlich Cookie Puss is better
@katiewalshstx It's good music!
@katiewalshstx Have you ever listened to Blood Orange?
@katiewalshstx Dev Hynes wrote "Everything Is Embarrassing" if that helps convince you.
@katiewalshstx "Everything Is Embarrassing" is a great song. NIGHT TIME, MY TIME is a pretty good album.
@katiewalshstx Sky Ferreira
I'm never going to drink Heineken Lite, Doogie.
@katiewalshstx Katy Perry
"When you're on the Queen Catherine, don't let 'em give you any of that flank steak bullshit. You know what I mean? Try the London Broil."
@ASamanthaRae @drafthouse CABIN BOY is soooooo good.
@mrbeaks Fish is still alive!
Did you guys hear COACH is coming back?
@jhoffman Your Phish jacket!
Shocking amount of similarities between RICHIE RICH and EX MACHINA.
@Bwpachinger @LAist That's a given.
.@LAist You left drinking off this.
Pierre The Pelican is my bae
@Hendyhendel You're disgusting
@Steele131 @mrbeaks @DAlter007 @elmayimbe It would have held better if people liked it.
@Steele131 @mrbeaks @DAlter007 @robertliefeld @elmayimbe It had a good opening weekend. Word of mouth wasn't good.
Hawks are the Emperor With no clothes.
@Bwpachinger It's no DADS.
It's a two camera sitcom with a laugh track and a sex robot.
I'm watching Netflix's RICHIE RICH. It's maybe the worst thing I've ever seen.
@tut___ Is this @Hendyhendel?
#BillyCrystalDUI
@ThaneEconomou @mattsinger That's 100% true.
What's everyone doing for Jay Leno's 65th birthday on Tuesday?
This is as close to a positive tweet you'll seem from me regarding that band.
Remember that time Mumford and Sons announced they were going on the sort of break every band goes on and people acted like they broke up?
I get an erection ever time Miss Piggy says "moi". Should I see someone about this?
@spencenicholson Eh. Who cares.
@spencenicholson I'll be honest and say I am in no way a Nirvana fan.
@mattsinger It's like those fan edits of Phantom Menace.
@mattsinger It's bad color timing. Leave that shit to professionals.
@kbiegel AKA My Fridge
@SidizenKane It also just looks like shit. The worst color timing ever.
MONTAGE OF HECK is playing at The Dome.
YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT! YASBECK TONIGHT!
@colleengreen420 That's horrible. I'm so sorry!
Danny Brown played Kenyon for send off?
@BBW_BFF Is the party in your car?
@michelledeidre I was shocked how entertaining it was outside of the baggage you bring into it.
I've seen nothing but accepting tweets for Bruce Jenner tonight and I've found that incredibly beautiful.
It was nice to come home to this. 
@somebadideas @FilmCritHULK You guys should see LITTLE BOY.
Someone played Foo Fighter's "My Hero" twice in a row at The Roost. I like this song but come on...
@ChrisAmick thank god.
@alonelikmacauly Ah rats.
@alonelikmacauly the 4:15!
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I'm okay with the way they used to do it with shame plates.
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson I have no sympathy for this. You should know better.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom I've seen too many of my friends die from it. Especially when they are at fault.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom a bottle of wine is different than a glass of wine
@hedofthebloom @spencenicholson I have real issues with drunk drivers. I'm a heavy drinker too.
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom just take an Uber
@spencenicholson @hedofthebloom yeahhhhhhhh
I'm so mad EX MACHINA nailed the Ghostbusters joke I've always wanted to make.
@brandonRohwer I might see that this week.
@Bwpachinger 
I still believe this.
My mindset after that Clippes/Spurs game. 
Can Steph Curry please play the 4th?
I could beat Curry in a game of 1-on-1.
How much will the FAST &amp; FURIOUS franchise change now that they serve Corona in a can?
I could score on any NBA player.
@denniswidmyer keep it in your pants.
@AddictedAICN Ghostbusters line.
Clippers are playing like trash.
Austin Rivers is our savior.
I'd be more impressed with the Joker's face tattoo if it said DRAKE.
Loved EX MACHINA. You get three guesses at what my favorite line is. It's obvious if you know me.
Do you think there will be a scene in SUICIDE SQUAD where Joker ponders how magnets work?
Crazy fire in Los Feliz/Silverlake.
The Golden Era of Television ended when they cancelled DADS. #BringBagDads
Shorts are v bad.
@mattsinger Tell her to voice her complaints to @amazingsupera!
@katiewalshstx Beats me!
You're telling me the man who said "Netflix rhymes with wet chicks" in a press release isn't racially sensitive?
@devincf How long have you been waiting to do that?
@denniswidmyer Sorry, it's my fault.
Pretty sure the only musicians Stephen Merritt truly loves are ABBA and Burl Ives.
69 LOVE SONGS is still kind of amazing.
CROOKED RAIN, CROOKED RAIN &gt; SLANTED &amp; ENCHANTED &gt; WOWEE ZOWEE &gt; BRIGHTEN THE CORNERS &gt; TERROR TWILIGHT

Everyone needs to read @DrewAtHitFix's ENTOURAGE set visit. 
Is Little Boy in AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON?
"It's my doody to please that booty." -Shaft
Is this an Onion article? 
@jessecarp Not really.
@jessecarp Only know because I have multiple friends that work on it!
@EvanDickson 8 1/2 minutes!!!!!
.@LAist Damn.
I'd like to think Michael Rapaport is playing the same NYC cop on LOUIE tonight that he played on FRIENDS.
We are not on the same brainwave if you live in LA and are not excited about the SOMETHING WILD/MARRIED TO THE MOB screening at @newbeverly.
@mrbeaks @Nickrob I guess it's his good luck charm. I don't know why he makes his teammates watch, though.
@Nickrob Yeah, great at basketball, bad at life.
This isn't a joke. I have heard from multiple sources that Curry poops his pants in the locker room after every single game.
Steph Curry would be so cool if he didn't poop his pants after every game.
The problem with this game has been a lack of Joey Crawford.
GS is still going to win it.
Like I said, GS has this game.
Golden State has this game.
@amazingsupera I'm going to go watch LOUIE.
@amazingsupera just fucking with you. Sounds like shit happened on your show.
@amazingsupera WHAT DID YOU DO?
@fifisexorama Now you have my attention.
@fifisexorama Nah.
@fifisexorama I've basically quit.
@fifisexorama whatevs
@fifisexorama You make bad trades.
@jehawks Ah, so you were the one who rented it from the library before me.
@MarcoTexRanger @Nickrob He arose in AIR CHRIST.
LeBron James is v good at basketball.
@michelledeidre @newbeverly I'll be there for both of those.
@Shout92 can show SOLDIER OF ORANGE with it
Cavs, defense?
I will definitely go to a BANK DICK/OBSERVE AND REPORT screening.
@mattsinger 
So much good stuff on the @newbeverly May Calendar.
Go Cavs!
Turned on TNT before the Cavs game to find a steampunk-themed episode of CASTLE.
Why the hell would you use "From the Director of THE VILLAGE" as a selling point?
@ThaneEconomou @Bwpachinger Did I do that?
Can we agree the most WTF moment of the BLACK MASS trailer is mustache Adam Scott?
I just saw a poster for Gasper Noe's LOVE that made me go <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE>
@MichaelNotCera Oh boy!
"We like to send out a mailer."
Fuck off, THE FORCE AWAKENS! My most anticipated film of 2015 is now AREA 51.
This is why Periscope was invented. 
BABA BOOEY HOWARD STERNS PENIS
I want to live in a world where Joey Crawford can't ref anymore.
@GriffLightning 
AREA 51 happened.
Today the impossible happened.
@GWBiscuit your mom
I accomplished my life goal of being good friends with a Jeopardy contestant.
@samdzimmerman @STYDNews April Fools was 22 days ago.
@samdzimmerman @STYDNews lol
I would go to Cannes just to see LOVE.
@MessEnScene You got a little over excited this week.
This week's @bestshow4life felt like it was specifically for me. @jakefogelnest talked about the Jerry Van Dyke Instagram!
@scharpling @jakefogelnest I wish Jake could be on every week.
I am...THE WATER DIVINER!

@GWBiscuit I didn't make this tweet
Team Skinny Weiners 
@SidizenKane @Sam_Strange It's good. Not WET HOT good but good.
MY ASS IS SMOOTH
@Sam_Strange You can say that again.
@ManMadeMoon They're my Western Conference team. I've been a Cavs fan all my life.
@ManMadeMoon I didn't know you are a Clips fan.
Zach Braff
I'm sure I've said this before but @mountain_goats BEAT THE CHAMP is really great.
@troniks PRESIDENT KEVIN JAMES!
If I don't see PIXELS with @troniks, I've failed at life.
@Nickrob NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
Killer Mike Fact: His favorite President is NOT Reagan.
Killer Mike is my hero.
@devincf I hope President Kevin James tries you for treason for this tweet.
@whatalanwatches Keep fucking that chicken!
@whatalanwatches Don't deny Kermit his fucking!
Froggy style!
Kermit is finally going to fuck!
@devincf Devin, they're finally going to fuck!
EL James' husband is writing the 50 SHADES OF GREY sequel. Do I even need to make a joke?
@Nickrob HEY!
@jehawks No.
@NordlingAICN ENTOURAGE
@NordlingAICN @mrbeaks He'll probably fall asleep during it.
I can't believe Pixar made a movie adaptation of a Spoon song.
@uhnet Someday I will do the Weezer Cruise.
@uhnet Maybe it will turn into that poop cruise from a few years ago.
Sorry, Scott Brooks.
.@VICE SHUT YOUR BUTT!
@ThaneEconomou I am Hamm.
Honestly, that ClickHole oral history of MAD MEN is one of the funniest things in a long time.
@ThaneEconomou ty?
@ThaneEconomou Dude, have you read the Clickhole oral history?
How about a show where it's Don Draper, baby?
I am Hamm.
@williambgoss Great Poster. I too love chilling out like Bradley Cooper.
@high_tower I've decided to watch the Dallas/Houston game and do this as opposed to going to watch LOST RIVER at the Sundance theater.

@ThaneEconomou DINOSAURED
@ThaneEconomou PERFECTED STRANGERS
When do we get WONDERER YEARS?
@devincf Don't skimp on your ENTOURAGE recap.
@HitFixGregory I FUCKING DO!
Domino's Pizza is has changed its name to Domino's. What is it in possession of now?
@ThaneEconomou whatevs
Perkins is in. #FireBlatt
There's no bigger turnoff than hearing "I love FALLING SKYS!"
.@ThePlaylist It started with IRON MAN 2.
Go Cavs!
Five minutes until I make that glorious tweet we all love so much.
I refuse to see one of these Marvel movies until Hulk fucks.
@kbiegel @mrbeaks Has anything brought so much joy for over 15 years?
@kbiegel @mrbeaks Were you listening the other day when they started destroying him again because of the tape.
@mrbeaks @kbiegel Bosth
@kerensacadenas @ComplexPop Congrats!
Re: Kiss/Scooby-Doo Movie: How did they get Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer to commit?
Instead of people writing their screenplays at coffee shops in LA, they should write them at various Subways.
@ThaneEconomou I don't.

NOT THE MOMMA!
@ThaneEconomou Got any cheese?
@ThaneEconomou Dude, I don't know if you are aware but those are all lines from FULL HOUSE!
FULLER HOUSE? Enough with the revivals. Seriously, CUT.IT.OUT!
My boy @PartTimeRogue is back!
.@LAist OH HELL YES!
@SidizenKane @Nickrob It's really fucked up.
The moral of tonight is don't piss of weed aficionados. Just ask @Nickrob.
@GWBiscuit it was made to get people to see his shitty friends shitty movie.
@GWBiscuit It's also 6 months old.
I once saw @Nickrob vape marijuana.
@alonelikmacauly Did Rivers find Jesus?
I'm a real cool guy! 
@AdamFrazier Archie, Veronica, Jugghead, Josie and the Pussycats
I now have four Weezer shirts!
@alonelikmacauly I haven't! We will totally rock these shirts together!
OMG! I just got my Weezer fan club package! Only @alonelikmacauly will care!
@bradmiska @Nickrob I love that man.
One of the most romantic lyrics I've heard in forever
"I haven't hated all the same thing as somebody else since I remember"
I want to eat brats right now.
You have to sign a NDA if you leave house in LA.
@jessecarp GENESYS will make it look okay.
@jessecarp never mind then!
@jessecarp Uh, that's Irrfan Khan.
This dude really wants to go to CinemaCon.
@MatthewPWells Trank will get fired way before that!
When does Ratner get his Star Wars film?
Someone paid $400 on Ebay for a RSD LP of that shitty new U2 album.
@DrewAtHitFix It's all that horrible weed smoke. Horrible, horrible weed smoke.
I once saw @Nickrob smoke weed.
I still feel gross reading anything that came out of the Sony hack. I'm not saying I haven't.
@Nickrob @devincf minecraft this 
Paul Blart should be in MALLRATS 2.
@katiewalshstx Isn't that just a popsicle?
Clippers looked great tonight. This is still going to be the series that gives me a heart attack.
@houx Yeah, "killer"
Austin Rivers for MVP!
@ASamanthaRae Yeah, gotta love that Axe body wash!
The Jazzman is at the Clippers game.
@MelissaStetten That shirt will be very smelly.
@todd_farmer it makes me happy!
@NordlingAICN I like when he jelqs
@ASamanthaRae @SixFlags it's pretty cool. I've designed all of them.
@brandonRohwer Buy one for me?
@brandonRohwer I do
@brandonRohwer own it
@thethermals That's why masturbation is the coolest.
Sorry, Bill Simmons. Not going to happen.  We're good.
I have a vinyl addiction. I hate that and this tweet twice as much as you do.
@kristapley @Michael_Calia @AdamFrazier I liked everyone other than the lead.
@kristapley @Michael_Calia @AdamFrazier This has caused me to watch GODZILLA again. I liked it enough the first time.
@kristapley I still don't know how good Edwards  is.
@SidizenKane I'm happy you met the stepmother!
@GWBiscuit @Bwpachinger Why don't people love Big Baby?
@devincf I still think Avengers will win.
I love this Cavs team.
@Bwpachinger I'm just sick on people dumping on him when he seems like a really good human being.
@sarah_sprague I hate that.
@Bwpachinger I was being sincere. He's doing great charity work. I respect the hell out of him.
@Bwpachinger I know this because I've heard you make those cracks to me!
@Bwpachinger Brian, you know those films will never happen.
@Darbmilne I think he's doing great stuff right now.
I'd rather George Lucas continue his current work with charity than make his experimental films.
Kyrie is my everything.
The NBA Playoffs brought to you by PITCH PERFECT 2.
@HitFixGregory Kyrie though!
I hear if you search James Harden's beard you'll find the remains of months old Taco Bell.
Do you think Gareth Edwards will hide the Death Star until the third act?
@alonelikmacauly @devincf @BrianDuffield in dying.
@ldbahr It won't be Josh Trank's film much longer.
Playoff Edition
Go Cavs!
@MisterMcCracken @devincf everyone would.
@mrbeaks @ItsTheBoat @devincf DJ Elliot Juniors
@devincf He found his ideal crowd.
@GWBiscuit Do you hate sand?
@GWBiscuit You alive?
.@ChaChaLoungeLA I do.
Rosalita isn't coming out tonight.
PREDICTION: Brooklyn Nets sweep the Atlanta Hawks.
WOULD SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN #LillyforTarget
I just saw a mother eating the entrails of another mother in the middle of the store. #LillyforTarget
.@clippersteveb Please don't go with that new Clippers logo. Everyone hates the team enough already.
@VogtRoberts Would you grant me personal time in it?
Man and dog. 
@GWBiscuit I have an easier solution.
I used to live here.  


@thethermals It sold out before I could get it :(
@devincf want to party?
@BBW_BFF I believe it's calls a denouement.
The amazing marcotexranger is cooking! 
@todd_farmer I hope you had a good time!
@mtgilchrist @365HorrorMovie Most places I went are 1 per customer.
@365HorrorMovie @mtgilchrist That's the one that pisses me off. I'm sure Todd is a huge Brand New fan.
@mtgilchrist @365HorrorMovie They still had Darjeeling at Permanent Records. Lang bought one.
@365HorrorMovie Eh. I mostly was tagging along at the end.
Five Record Stores. Five Purchases.
@BBW_BFF You mean watching the end of a movie, right?
So @johnHlang just revealed he doesn't know what MR. BELVEDERE is.
I'm hitting up my 4th record store.
@ldbahr What was the budget?
@brandonRohwer HOLY FUCKING SHIT!
@yarafigueroa I read that as fartshamed.
Churro ice cream sandwich, you are my only love! 
@Hendyhendel I'm already dedicated and it's a block from my place.
The line for Churro Borough is wayyyyyy too long.
@williambgoss I'm awaiting yours.
@williambgoss I'm right.
Sorry Drake :(
GA GA GA GA GA &gt; GIRLS CAN TELL &gt; THEY WANT MY SOUL &gt; KILL THE MOONLIGHT &gt; GIMME FICTION &gt; A SERIES OF SNEAKS &gt; TRANSFERENCE
My favorite Michael Shannon album! 
My RSD haul! 
I'm really identifying with the opening bit of this week's LOUIE right now.
@mtgilchrist I didn't bring a ton of cash with me or I would.
@BBW_BFF It's just called breakfast right now.
.@KingJames Want me to pick you up any records at Origami?
@mtgilchrist @EvanDickson seeing them live was my Coachella 2012 highlight.
@EvanDickson Jarvis is the best.
Also, I love 1960s Adam West Batman.
I saw BATMAN &amp; ROBIN in theaters. I'm pretty sure you can't get worse than that Batman-wise.
@EvanDickson agreed
Jan De Bont was mauled by a tiger on ROAR and needed 200 stitches. That's still not the worst thing to happen in his career. SPEED 2 is.
Guys, NBA playoffs start today! Isn't life great?
I have to make caca. Get the details.
I woke up way too early for records.
@houx lol
@BBW_BFF keep reaching for the stars
@BBW_BFF trying to top yourself?
ROAR needs to be seen with an audience.
ROAR is insane.
@Joeyaucoin I'm a huge Cavs fan.
@ScottObiSwan We could only hope.
@FilmCritHULK How much of that movie feels like ADR?
"Some girls are bigger than others." - Michael Shannon
@doloresquintana why the fuck would you want to know that?
I've always said Michael Shannon is the next Morrissey.
@mrbeaks @pitchfork it is their best album.
@mrbeaks @pitchfork I had to RT that out of the sure WTF factor.
@Bwpachinger it's a sitcom about a Las Vegas expansion basketball team.
@Bwpachinger It's a show on Yahoo.
@Bwpachinger exactly.
Something has been nagging at me for weeks now. Has someone actually watched an episode of Sin City Saints?
@jessecarp ;)
@jessecarp He was great on WHITNEY.
@Joeyaucoin No chance in hell.
@jessecarp I saw him go apeshit at the Laugh Factory one night.
@earnestp I love it!
This is dumb, Andrew.
Lakers fans better like investigative journalism because it's going to be 2020 before their team is relevant again.
@GWBiscuit This is a three finger tweet!
@DrewAtHitFix Eastbound and down, loadin' up and truckin'
@GWBiscuit Friday night is good for jelqin'
@GWBiscuit Grab your Jergens!
The biggest problem with MAN OF STEEL is that Pa Kent never asked Clark to "Have a catch."
@mrbeaks I was going to be nice and say 2020.
@365HorrorMovie That's not going to happen. It's going to take long we than that.
When's the first Lakers playoff game?
@BBW_BFF The answer is DARKMAN.
@johnHlang I LOVE YOU, HONEYBEAR!!!
@sarah_sprague I might go get one of these bad boys right now. This could be dangerous.
@mtgilchrist Whoa. That's brilliant.
@mtgilchrist He should be hired for every wedding!
@mtgilchrist Is it the same dude from yesterday?
@mtgilchrist You talking about my boy DJ Elliot?
@ThaneEconomou I do miss the Portuguese subtitles, though.
@ThaneEconomou They did.
I honestly could not tell they were pushing into a Superman statue in that leaked trailer.
@Bwpachinger @chris_lettera #family
@sarah_sprague 
This churro ice cream sandwich place a block away will be the death of me.
@Bwpachinger @dannymears They'll keep making Riddick movies to keep him on!
@Bwpachinger Muppet Babies but Fast &amp; Furious.
@ThaneEconomou Notice that Gene's is the tallest.
@ThaneEconomou You know the answer.
I'm watching the scene in MAN OF STEEL where Clark saves the school bus and it makes me wish he had been in THE SWEET HEREAFTER.
@Nickrob How have you never told me this?
"Paul finds himself in the same elevator with Mini Kiss."

Fine. I'll see it.
George Lucas is probably right about Marvel remaking Howard The Duck. How could you not? 
@mikeryan I already have a pitch! 
@MarcoTexRanger HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!
I hope in the new INDEPENDENCE DAY Bill Pullman's character has passed laws that have allowed him to be President for the past 25 years.
I hope the new season of COACH has an episode called "Coach-ella".
PAUL BLART:MALL COP 2 is the most important film since BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN
@brandonRohwer 
@brandonRohwer For me?
Joe John Abrams
@williambgoss bad dates
@williambgoss This summer
The @drafthouse is playing CABIN BOY with Chris Elliott :(
@365HorrorMovie @mtgilchrist @VacationVinyl Origami opens at 8 so I might hit that first and come there if I don't get everything I want.
Are the rumors of a Droopy McCool cameo true?
What time is the Salacious Crumb panel?
@365HorrorMovie @mtgilchrist @VacationVinyl I want the Deja Entendu LP! Also, a Father John Misty 7".
@365HorrorMovie @mtgilchrist @VacationVinyl Do they have a list of what they have?
"Jar Jar, we're home."

"Mesa so happy, Watto!"
@jessecarp @mtgilchrist I wish those were dropping!
@mtgilchrist I'll probably hit up Amoeba. I only am looking for like three things.
@mtgilchrist Where you going?
Chewie, let's bone.
@ldbahr <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@brandonRohwer Beaks found an AOTC Watto.
@brandonRohwer you're watching your action figures
@brandonRohwer sexy
Nothing is quite as depressing as hearing Joey Ramone died listening to a U2 show.
@DavidPoland I never quit loving that.
@BBW_BFF I found all five in an alleyway behind a TJ Maxx retail strip mall in  Pomona.
@BBW_BFF I have 5 pairs of those pants.
"Duel of the Fates" should have been reserved for scenes that only featured Gungans.
@houx Mhmmmm. I want that. There is a place that serves churro ice cream sandwiches a block from me now.
@alonelikmacauly You know how I wrestle with them.
@brandonRohwer I'm coming to Anaheim right now.
@hedofthebloom Of course.
I'm really happy to be excited about something I loved unconditionally as a child again.
I still not sure what happens in THE FORCE AWAKENS and I've heard it all.
@DrGMLaTulippe @ThaneEconomou Thane got it!
@DrGMLaTulippe The topic was historical LA Landmarks.
@DrGMLaTulippe I like to try and guess the Final Jeopardy answer based solely on the topic. I've done it once.
@jenyamato @Bwpachinger it's v good
@jenyamato @Bwpachinger it's a great song.
You're everything that I see
#ChewieWereHome 
Brand New played "Mixtape" and I felt like I was 16. Watched the Star Wars trailer and felt like I was 9. Anyone have a Teddy Ruxpin?
@MarcoTexRanger @mrbeaks What do you have against Joe John?
@MarcoTexRanger @TheWolfman @mtgilchrist I bought 8.
@MarcoTexRanger @mtgilchrist What if the main characters name was...Haluski.
@MarcoTexRanger Chewie?
I never thought I'd see Han Solo ever again so goddamn right I got misty eyed.
@TheWolfman It's basically a LAST TANGO IN PARIS remake with my boy as Brando.
@TheWolfman I'm going in next Wednesday to pitch a Boss Nass standalone film. Wish me luck!
@Hendyhendel First 2 seasons are on Amazon Prime if you have that.
@somebadideas @DrGMLaTulippe Isn't that a pretty large fare? Do they not want to get stuck driving people in Brooklyn then?
@devincf @EricVespe It was the Forest Moon of Endor. Come on, guys!
@bradmiska ;)
Top 3 Trailers of the year:

3. Star Wars: The Force Awakens
2. Mad Max Fury Road
1. Entourage
@mrbeaks Did the Mommy Bloggers get their own special roped off section for the panel?
@MatthewPWells I am dying right now.
I'm still pissed that DJ Elliot wasn't in the trailer.
@mrbeaks I WANT THIS SO MUCH!
@neveldinetaylor It's not.
#BB8 is my bae
@tut___ Yes, Joe John Abrams.
That trailer. I can't even...
Harrison crashed that plane so he didn't have to be here today.
Kenny Baker has been in all 7 right?
I might be making jokes but I'm loving the hell out of this!
Who owns BB8? Who is Masterb8?
The desert planet is called Jackoff.
"I didn't get Star Wars until I saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES." - JJ
@SidizenKane Didn't you see? It's #CP30
#DJElliot
.@mrbeaks Can you get me DJ Elliot's autograph?
I am already planning on hiring DJ Elliot for my wedding.
@365HorrorMovie He sent me a bag of poop.
Just heard they cancelled the panel. JJ got food poisoning from eating that pizza.
@ldbahr I bet you are really excited to stick around and watch the entire prequel trilogy in 3D!
@uhnet :(
@uhnet I never do the merch table.
@uhnet Damn! I didn't get that!
@uhnet You mean set list?
@mattnotis Possibly.
@fart @YouTube I can never tell if this is a joke because it's a great song and video.
Just posted a video 
Just heard a new Brand New song played for the first time.
@brandonRohwer I think Faraci is down there. Go chill with him!
@brandonRohwer shuddup Brand New is about to go on!
Really excited about this one. 
@EvanDickson I'm really happy you beat cancer.
Brand New/Built To Spill/Desparacidos (@ Shrine Auditorium &amp; Expo Hall - @shrinela for BRAND NEW in Los Angeles, CA) 
@sarah_sprague that's very kind of you!
@sarah_sprague Sarah, you know I'd never mute you ;)
Noble Prize for whoever created the mute option.
@Tupacca I bet he poops his pants a lot.
There will be a 70mm screening of LARRY CROWNE on May 25th.
@.mrbeaks @GWBiscuit whoa. @Nickrob and I will not take this. That was personal.
@mrbeaks @GWBiscuit There are 20 I could list from LARRY CROWNE.
How the hell are the doors 6:30 for this concert tonight?
@Roberta_Glass @StockStickler They beat you!
We need to talk about bone broth...
@Tupacca That Geoff dude seems really cool.
@hermajestydrew Yes, because it's called DM on here. A good person would know that.
You have to love that JUSTIFIED snuck Dave Koechner in there at the last moment.
The most baffling thing about PAUL BLART: MALL COP 2 is that it took six years to happen.
@JEBermanator Honestly, THE BOX would have probably been better with a little studio interference.
@JEBermanator Not a huge fan of the other two but I recognize they were a risk.
Remember that time Warner Bros. released OBSERVE &amp; REPORT?
@jessecarp truth
@MarcoTexRanger I really need to revisit that movie.
@MarcoTexRanger That would be believable if it was OBSERVE &amp; REPORT 2!
@johnHlang @MarcoTexRanger I didn't know you knew Kevin James!
@MarcoTexRanger but that tv ad was so funny!
@MarcoTexRanger Are we going to go see Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 together?
@jessecarp @Sethrogen OH! Look at you cool guy!
@philbertgrape a memory erasing bullet!
@DrGMLaTulippe I was waiting!
@philbertgrape He could have been Wolverine!
@philbertgrape It's not great but it has a motorcycle duel.
@benmekler @ThaneEconomou The real irony would be if Renner died making one.
@Hendyhendel There's a car chase going on and @DrGMLaTulippe doesn't know?
@ThaneEconomou @benmekler Yeah, you convinced me to like 2 a little bit.
I figured people would be laughing at me for not putting 2 last.
MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 1&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3
@jamesfflynn @Nickrob You could have just said Porkins.
@cronos166 @jontaffer No but it would be amazing.
Dreams do come true! 
The Comedy Central Roast of @jontaffer!
@HumanPog @jontaffer @BarRescue @spike @NightclubBar HE'S THE BEST!
@AndyRossTheBoss @Nickrob Never mind. That site is parody.
@AndyRossTheBoss @Nickrob Is that real?
If anyone wants to meet @Nickrob publicly, he will be at STAR WARS CELEBRATION dressed as "Sexy Jar Jar Binks"
My mother has a fine home, Eddie Vedder. Go away.
@Nickrob Oh fuck no.
@BBW_BFF Then you won.
@dylearium @devincf No.
That'll do JUSTIFIED. That'll do.
@devincf @dylearium couldn't have said it better myself.
@FilmCritHULK @devincf I know people who love him. I can't in any way understand why, but they do.
@devincf At what point during filming do you think they regret Elden Henson?
@devincf As different characters?
Might be a little tipsy at emo night
@williambgoss tomorrow
Turned on The Best Show to hear @scharpling and @julieklausner talk about THE COMEDIANS. Love it.
INTERVIEWER: Is there anything you've ever regretted?

GOD: Jim Morrison.
@ThaneEconomou 
@whatalanwatches 
Do you think Billy Crystal breaks out The Jazzman on Letterman tonight?
@brockwilbur I kind of love it. I can't wait to see them tomorrow.
@Bwpachinger @jessecarp 6 minutes @ThaneEconomou
Five seconds of terraforming
Yes, I was watching @arzE's periscope. Good, deep, thoughtful stuff.
I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever see Cloud Nothings.
I made sure to wash my Taking Back Tuesday shirt for @emonightLA!
At the moment you can buy a ticket for The Replacements concert tomorrow for $21 on StubHub. A Brand New ticket will cost you $150.
@brandonRohwer Tickets are going for a lot right now.
@brandonRohwer I wish you were seeing Brand New with me tomorrow.
@brandonRohwer :(
@brandonRohwer Your job is cool.
@uhnet ugh. Sorry dude.
@uhnet is it that bad?
@uhnet @SW_Celebration @starwars You still going to make it to emo night?
@ThaneEconomou @Hendyhendel That's also called stock.
@DavidRaposa Still coming tonight?
@jenyamato Did he bring the big jeans with him?
Dennis Quaid blow-up video (real or fake)&gt;Randy Quaid sex video
I might watch JOE DIRT since Christopher Walken back. He had the best joke in the first.
@sarah_sprague She's a coupon lady.
@sarah_sprague my mom has mad Bed Bath &amp; Beyond game.
@sarah_sprague She loves Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and delights in using their coupons.
I don't understand people saying Hawkeye finally gets his due in the new Avengers when he was the main character in MASH for 11 seasons.
@GriffLightning Keep us updated.
They won't be streaming the 3D prints of the prequel trilogy so I'm still jealous of everyone going to Celebration!

DEXTER JETTSER IN 3D!
PALIN 2016
@sarah_sprague That's some Abbi from Broad City shit!
RON PAUL 2016
@Hendyhendel I heard beer is good.
The only good college flashback is in MACGRUBER.
Yes, I like this new Brand New song very much.
Dopey The Dick!
@fart Happy Birthday Jon! I miss your food of the day.
@spencenicholson Just kidding! I don't have an AppleWatch! No one can shoot me in the foot!
@spencenicholson My AppleWatch.
@fifisexorama I might be in for the night.
@jessecarp He's already played one superhero!
I can't believe I'm still blocked by Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.
@fifisexorama @mrbeaks @devincf tempting...
@MessEnScene I do not.
@MessEnScene @bestshow4life @devincf @badassdigest I laughed at this
you were such a pyt catching all the lights
Michelle MacLaren for a movie where she has creative freedom and a good script!
I liked last night's MAD MEN #hottake
@VogtRoberts I like that shot but it's not on the same level in any way.
@MarcoTexRanger I have always been Team Marco!
@ThaneEconomou Didn't stall because of Orci?
@ThaneEconomou Wasn't it happening before the short?
@dannymears maybe you should jerk off.
@dannymears u mad bro?
Drake is my bae
MAD MEN is wonderful because it's the smartest show on television and you can treat it like a soap opera.
@dannymears I like this tweet. Who else will?
The lovely @sarah_sprague is amazing! 
No one spoil tonight's BAR RESCUE for me.
.@RankEatingWeb yes
I didn't know this happened! 
@GerryDuggan What's your favorite time to poop?
@dannymears Sounds right up my alley!
@dannymears He is verified!
@JimJarmuschHair I sent  a counter offer.
@dannymears Did you tap yer screen?
Only $15 for a PSP of NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE. What a steal! 
@sarah_sprague I promise not to Periscope your entire party!
George Railroad Martin
In honor of GAME OF THRONES coming back tonight.


I think it's time for me to announce that I will be Hillary's Vice President elect.
It's too bad Pete Seeger isn't alive to see Mumford &amp; Sons go electric.
@devincf Same with STAR WARS. No one seems to know or care there is a new Star Wars movie coming out.
@ldbahr why not? It seems right up your alley.
@ldbahr I saw A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD so I will never get Jai Courtney.
@kbiegel is that SPACE JAM?
I still love Ratatat so much.
@Roberta_Glass I've seen them before and they are great.
@MarcoTexRanger @mtgilchrist @Filmdrunk I came--

I think we can all agree we knew where I was going with that.
@Roberta_Glass @Built_2_Spill @SLOBrewingCo I'm seeing them Wednesday.
"James Grey came back?" -@adamjhendricks on GROWN UPS 2
@MessEnScene holy shit
Kidnaping 
@Darbmilne I am a fan
@shanevader it's v good
@kbiegel is that SPACE JAM?
This beer stuff is good. I give it my full endorsement!
@SidizenKane it's good stuff. Give it another shot!
Have you guys ever tried beer?
@SidizenKane I just hate it
@MessEnScene I don't follow him
@BBW_BFF same
DEANDRE MADE BOTH!
@MessEnScene They win?
@philiplord Clippers are still going to win.
@TheRobotard8000 @mrbeaks Yeah, what he said.
Kenny Lofton is at the Clippers game!
Clippers about to go on a heat streak. They have this game.
@benmiller @johnHlang not really
@MessEnScene @bestshow4life is it everything you imagined?
@johnHlang A shirt fall onto the hoop and they had to stop play.
@mountain_goats @rianjohnson In a brilliant career it's one of your bests.
@bedtimebonzob @Nickrob Nick likes the Chicken Joy!
Something is happening at the Clippers game I've never seen before.
@bedtimebonzob Filipino fast food. It's the worst. There's on on Beverly. @Nickrob loves it.
@ASamanthaRae good girl
@bedtimebonzob YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO JOLLIBEE!?
@ASamanthaRae @VulcanVideoATX @AustinsPizza You should watch BROADCAST NEWS though
@ASamanthaRae @VulcanVideoATX @AustinsPizza never mind I read one of those wrong
@TheSnarls @bedtimebonzob Is that JOLLIBEE mascot!?
@devincf That's the one with the Russian right?
@jessecarp It's called Foggy.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi I'm excited for all three of those bands.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi Yeah, I got a ticket for about $10 more than asking price on StubHub.
@MessEnScene Cause it is. It's stripper training.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi No, LA. Shrine Expo.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi I've never seen Brand New. I've seen BtS many times.
#BlartRidesAgain
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi it doesn't make sense to me either.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi Built To Spill and Desaparecidos are opening.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi If You C Jordan.

BTW I'm seeing Brand New on Wednesday.
@devincf You're not invited to my BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ screening then!
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi my early-00s emo knowledge is still sharp.
@RylandAldrich @nicizzi I know my Something Corporate!
@RylandAldrich Konstantine?
@RylandAldrich Punk Rock Princess?
@RylandAldrich Woke Up In A Car?
@RylandAldrich What Something Corporate song?
@mrbeaks @mollylambert He spends most of his time in the Sahara tent.
@ThaneEconomou @genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive @Hooters They should get @jontaffer to fix it.
@MisterMcCracken Does Bash Brother ever learn to act.
@ThaneEconomou @genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive @Hooters No but they have BMX Bikers.
@ThaneEconomou @genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive I spent at least $4,500. I'll just go to Hooters and watch now.
@ThaneEconomou @genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive I might boycott!
.@genesimmons @PaulStanleyLive What happened to the dancing girls in cages? Will this be answered in second season of 4TH AND LOUD?
@MessEnScene THEY WILL BE BACK!
@MessEnScene They still have fireworks?
@bedtimebonzob Pisses me off. BRING BACK THE HOBBIT MENU!
Sounds like LA KISS no longer has dancing girls in cages hanging above the field throughout the entire game.
@MessEnScene Oh that was the best part!
@MessEnScene Do they still have girls in cages?
@williambgoss @FilmCritHULK Have you shit the hell up?
@FilmCritHULK It does mean people shit the hell up about HOUSE OF CARDS after a week.
@Tupacca He seems like a swell dude!
If Marvel doesn't tackle this in the MCU they can go fuck themselves. 
First new Ratatat track in five years just dropped. It sounds like Ratatat.


@rianjohnson It's so good.
@ben_gdfry HOLY COW!
@FilmCritHULK @CGRunyon Yeah, that also happened to a friend's movie.
@brandonRohwer I bet he still thinks of me.
Never forget
 

Did Chris Evans ever put his blood in a comic book? I think not!
@dannymears Sorry, I'm illiterate.
@dannymears Is that the one with their blood in it?
@brandonRohwer Did I send that to you or did he block you too?
I wish instead of the MCU it was the KCU. KISS CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.
@MessEnScene You are in for a treat!
@HitFixGregory @Nickrob Nick is a Mavs fan.
Denny's Coachella Menu is a slap in the face to the Hobbit Menu.
@Bwpachinger @mrbeaks Hopefully. He has to fight the break of dawn.
@Bwpachinger @mrbeaks Yes, because he is going to Save Tonight.
@AndyRossTheBoss That was it without the jacket.
Don't forget to turn on ESPN 2 to watch the LA KISS!
You see every color of the rainbow in those things.
I wish I was in a Coachella porta potty right now :(
@flea333 @kristapley Good tweet!
There are more jokes in THE COMEDIANS about 1600 PENN than jokes in 1600 PENN.
HOLY HELL THE END OF EPISODE 4 OF DAREDEVIL!
@Bwpachinger I almost was done after the first two minutes, though. Some really bad initial aesthetic choices.
@mrbeaks Is it Scarlett because of the meme?
D'onofrio is so good in DAREDEVIL. It's some of the best work he's done in years.
@Bwpachinger I like it. It's not perfect. The second episode has a great shot.
@Bwpachinger D'onofrio is really fucking good in it. The dude who plays Foggy is atrocious.
@AriumJL @CheesyNuggets @JumpcutCafe Sorry to hear that.
I rewatched THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS. Every line felt like it was ADR.
@gholson I love those wonderful Evanescence songs, though.
@AriumJL @CheesyNuggets @JumpcutCafe How? Aren't you illiterate?
I saw Beck getting take out at a bar last night. He didn't want me to know he was Beck.
@Darbmilne He went to see Drake. He is a huge Drake fan.
Clint Eastwood is at Coachella. He went to see Drake.
Alligator&gt;High Violet&gt;Boxer&gt;Trouble Will Find Me
@jessecarp @hedofthebloom Okay, the fat redhead from THE SANDLOT.
@jessecarp @hedofthebloom Get the fat redhead from THE BIG GREEN.
@hedofthebloom He's horrible. That's just atrocious acting.
Bash Brother really can't act.
Sex with me is like the Yankees-Red Sox game. It takes an eternity and is boring as hell.
George Miller is a mastermind.
@BobbyMiller @williambgoss Don't listen to this dick. StevenSpielberg@universalmovies.com
@MisterMcCracken your mom is naked in the second half
@brandonRohwer @jontaffer THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!
Salon needs to be reminded of this.
I think we all make mistakes. I try and remember that before calling out people.
How the fuck did Arnold get into Yale at his age? 
@jhoffman @jvancitters I played it last weekend!
@SidizenKane It's wonderful it is Salon.
@SidizenKane @kumailn @Salon @kunalnayyar HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!
If AQUAMAN doesn't open to a $116.8 million opening weekend we have failed as a society.
@SidizenKane I hate sand
@SidizenKane That one made the least. I wonder why...
@EvanDickson Damn. I thought we might be jamming to SK together :(
@SidizenKane I always felt like the prequel trilogy underperformed while making truckloads of cash.
@SidizenKane @BrianDuffield I still think AVENGERS 2 is going to make more. I expect it to make 2 billion.
@SidizenKane @BrianDuffield Movies released the week before Christmas are almost guaranteed two huge weekends.
@MessEnScene @BrianDuffield You're not now. One of those is coming out in a few weeks and the other in 7 months.
@BrianDuffield @SidizenKane But movies tend to play longer during that season.
@BrianDuffield @SidizenKane I think it's really hard to get HUGE opening weekends in December. People are busy as hell.
@BrianDuffield AVENGERS has bigger opening and overall gross.
@AndyRossTheBoss @joaqspoblete Yeah, it's something like 16/17 for him though.
@Hendyhendel too busy watching DAREDEVIL?
Hey @joaqspoblete how many times have you seen Death Cab?
@jhoffman Weird Coachella tweet.
@brandonRohwer @rejects He's really bad.
"Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes." - Ginsberg
Cause baby now we've got bad blood
I have a lot of issues with DAREDEVIL so far but overall I like it.
@dannymears tickets revoked
@jessecarp I can smell it like a bloodhound.
@jessecarp and Vinny Chase should be in it.
PSA: Watch more COLUMBO
@salesonfilm My favorite part was when someone at the potluck asked him about Jane's violin lessons.
@jessecarp @Nickrob I'm also an only child.
@Nickrob me neither
I'm really curious how many people have read THE DARK TOWER series. I have no clue how you do those later books.
Why isn't Steel in Justice League. How awesome would a Shaq/Ben Affleck team up be?
@GriffLightning and equally as sexy.
@jessecarp Yeah, I'm just tired of these tropes. It feels lazy.
Bash Brother cannot act.
@EricDSnider I'm very sorry for your loss. DOWN WITH WEED!
@brandonRohwer I love that episode so much.
I could listen to Vince Gilligan talk about classic television episodes all day.
@joaqspoblete I do get to see Brand New/Built To Spill/Desaparecidos
@joaqspoblete I'm not going to Coachella.
@joaqspoblete I won Replacements tickets but I can't make it.
@joaqspoblete I want to know how they got tickets.
@EricDSnider Might save 100,000 of lives from weed overdoses too!
@ThaneEconomou This is what I figured.
Wasn't there a MTV Rocky Horror remake in the works years ago?
@jhoffman I think it has some great songs but it's not a well made movie. It's totally up for a remake.
@jhoffman Might want to rewrite this one.
.@HitFixDaniel WTF?!?!?! NO!
I'll never forget the first time I vomited all over Cedar Point. Mother was very proud of me that day.
@AdamFrazier That's really screwed up. Who comes into a movie 30 minutes in?
"Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush."
@devincf Who are these people who go looking for this dirt? They are like sleazy private detective characters you'd find in pulp fiction.
@ThaneEconomou @Bwpachinger You don't think I can smooth talk sleazy people?
@ThaneEconomou @Bwpachinger You'd probably have to ditch me as a friend!
@emachtus take a hammer and smack it a few times.
@emachtus I know a full-proof way to fix it.
What if that's the BEST scene in JURASSIC WORLD?!
@ThaneEconomou ZING!
On a more positive side, we have someone new to blame for bleeding us dry when it comes to Star Wars!
I'll give it another go tomorrow but if I don't hear any Evanescence anytime soon I'm done.
Turned DAREDEVIL off two minutes in!
@MisterMcCracken Yeah, but the jokes with her stomach issues made every scene go cold for me.
INHERENT VICE is available to rent so there goes the rest of my night.
@MisterMcCracken I thought it was painful.
@MisterMcCracken What?
@MisterMcCracken What?
@devincf I feel bad for anyone who has to deliver those lines.
I'll probably lie and tell you you're wrong even if you're not.
There was a joke on tonight's LOUIE that had my howling. Feel free to take a guess.
@EvanDickson I'm doing the Thursday show.
@EvanDickson You seeing them?
It was a really daring choice made by Whedon to score AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON entirely to Don Henley songs.
"One More Hour" is my favorite Sleater-Kinney song.
@BBW_BFF 
@kbiegel Is that from SPACE JAM?
@sepinwall Hate correcting you but it was his sister who had the pregnancy scare in season 2. His neighbors helped calm him.
.@kanyewest Not a huge AKIRA fan but how could I disagree with THERE WILL BE BLOOD, Ye?
USED CARS features the best Kurt Russell performance.
@Joeyaucoin He basically had to make ROMANCING THE STONE.
I'm watching USED CARS because it's one of the greatest movies ever made.
@SidizenKane He's the best!
@SidizenKane For LCJ?
@MarcoTexRanger @mtgilchrist @BrianWCollins @Sam_Strange @badassdigest yeah she does!
This is my new favorite show.


Was there a character actor that wasn't featured in JUSTIFIED during its entire run?
@SpannerCraig @Tupacca Holy cow. Where did this come from?
@teeneyteeney @amoebamusic @TheReplacements @thepalladium It was very smart of them, Teeney.
@ThatDonLewis 
@amoebamusic @TheReplacements @thepalladium THANKS!
@Brandon_Bird @devincf They are showing the 3-D prequel trilogy at Celebration.
@Brandon_Bird @devincf Yeah, I think I've heard they did all six. They were going to release them then the Disney thing happened.
@Brandon_Bird @devincf That seems very probable.
PROBLEM CHILD introduced me to Jack Warden as a child so it will always be dear to my heart.
@HeavyMidnites @cinefamily !!!!!!!!
True Fleektective
@samdzimmerman I am already doing my pirouettes in hopes of being cast.
Does this mean ENTOURAGE isn't real?
I thought Bobby Flay was single since he dated Mrs. Ari in the final season of ENTOURAGE.
@uhnet so close but no cigar.
@uhnet I almost sent this to you yesterday.
@jlichman @brandonRohwer I remember being excited as a kid because MR. SATURDAY NIGHT was the NBC movie of the week.
Only 10.5 hours until THE COMEDIANS! It's going to be Gad time!
@devincf @GermainLussier You should skip that so you won't miss the premiere of THE COMEDIANS!
@MarcoTexRanger @mrbeaks I can believe Vaughn can pull off playing Reinhold but now way in hell does he have the chops for Savage.
@mrbeaks He's King Jelq, right?
Why make anything of quality when all people care about are mustaches anymore?
New Wrens album is done...

New Wrens albums is done...

NEW WRENS ALBUM IS DONE!
@ThaneEconomou That dialogue!
New Waxahatchee is <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@somebadideas That's not the first thing to use "The Big Ship" is it?
@DrewAtHitFix I feel like you are trying to convince yourself that you can fall asleep!
@somebadideas @ThaneEconomou 100%
65% of dudes in LA look like Jay Duplass
STEPBROTHERS is a much better film than BIRDMAN.
@ThaneEconomou I should be a film critic for this.
@hedofthebloom eff you?
I can't remember the last time I used Uber and didn't have surge pricing.
@Bwpachinger @somebadideas IRON MAN 2
@adamjhendricks @Nickrob @TheAmyNicholson Octopus' Garden
ICYMI The Doors suck.
@TheAmyNicholson @Nickrob Thanks, Amy. You're a real nice person!
@ASamanthaRae don't throw the masterpiece called ELISABETHTOWN under the bus.
The correct answer to Nick's question is "A Day In The Life"
@JoeMande @KenTremendous Yung Joc!
No one is helping this bar argument I'm having with @Nickrob!
@MessEnScene that where @Nickrob guessed!
@MessEnScene What scene in FURIOUS 7 made Wells walk out?
@brandonRohwer @tbonebrisket Perfect!
@brandonRohwer Was that in the EU?
Look how everyone treated Porkins. It makes me very sad. 
@brockwilbur Did she right swipe you?
