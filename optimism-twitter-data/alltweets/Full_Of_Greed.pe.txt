@DemonOfAvarice "Why?"
@PerishAndDecay Alexis didn't say a word only wrapped her arms around him and started to cry softly.
@PerishAndDecay "I just need a hug from a friend...Thats all..."
@PerishAndDecay "Get your ass over here right now,Alexander!"
@IncarnatedFury "What the Fuck do you want!?" Alexis turned around and finally stopped walking.
@Temperantia_ "Yes you are....Just let me love you!"
@IncarnatedFury "No! Leave me alone!" Alexis screamed back as she looked over at him,continuing to walk away.
@IncarnatedFury "Make me asswipe!"
@Temperantia_ "I know right?!  Just like you!"
@Temperantia_ 
"Yes!  Two cute ones,why do you ask?" 
"Definitely!  Dogs are sooo cute!" 
@IncarnatedFury "She's basically your girlfriend so,Yeah go drink with her.." 
@SeventhSinPride "Well,You'd have to ask Zero about that..."
@SeventhSinPride "Hopefully you can last all night long...."
@SeventhSinPride "So,how long do you last usually?"
@SeventhSinPride "Really?  All mine?" 
"Well,it'll be all yours tonight, if you'd like" 
@LazyHellPrince Okay? I'm glad that my dear sister has someone such as yourself, she deserves only the best.
"You seem to like a lot of things that I have, Pride" 
@SeventhSinPride 
@SeventhSinPride "Now..And my place " 
"Duh!" 
"Well, I'm right here big boy " 
"Well, Zero couldn't take how rough it was, he was screaming all night long" 
"Yeah, like scratches on your back kind of wild " 
@AshleyHere_ "Yay!  But,first put on something adorable! " Alexis grinned and looked at what the woman was wearing.
"Are you sure? I can't get pretty wild " 
"I don't think you could handle me..." 
@AshleyHere_ "Yes,you! Come on, We're going to a bar "
"Where's that girl that wanted to be my drinking buddy? We're going to a bar ASAP " 
"Oh really? You'd want to wake up with me next to you?" 
"Surprisingly, no one wants to wake up with me next to them.."

@AshleyHere_ "You'd be perfect for a drinking buddy!  What all do you drink though?"
@IncarnatedFury Hmmm, Oh really? Why don't you drink with your girlfriend Chasity? 
I need a drinking buddy,any takers? 
@IncarnatedFury "Then leave me alone! Just stop going after me!" Alexis moved away from him and continued to walk.
it is as simple,
and as complicated as that.”
@IncarnatedFury "Dogs are loyal...Unlike someone I know and cats aren't loyal they cause depression "

|| Ima stay as Kate because, She's fucking amazing and fits perfect for Greed. 
@LipsofSorrow "Thanks, Sis..You're like the only one that has ever listened to me..." Alexis gave her sister another tight hug.
|| Guys,I'm stuck between FCs Lana del Rey and Kate Upton, I need opinions! 
@LipsofSorrow "Why do you think I'll be able to find love? My dear sister, I don't think I will either..But,I accept that I won't "
@LipsofSorrow ~ and crossed her arms.
@LipsofSorrow "It just sucks that I get feelings like this...Like,why couldn't Lust get feelings like this or something.. " Alexis groaned~
@LipsofSorrow "Maybe...I don't know,Well I think he does...Fuck, I hate being a hopeless romantic.."
@CcldSadist "I can...It's just an odd thing to have.. Sins can love and have romance it just depends on the sin"
"I just can't get over at how no one fancys me..Am I not worthy for such romance?" 
@IncarnatedFury "Fuck Yes...Don't start with me cause you won't win!"
"Whoo!  #SeductiveSunday time!" 
@IncarnatedFury "/No/ Dogs are better!" 
@IncarnatedFury "Nah,That's your opinion.. " 
"Princess on the streets, Whore in the sheets" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LipsofSorrow "Duh! What would you want to do though?"
"At least this puppy loves me..." 
@IncarnatedFury Alexis didn't say anything nor did stop crying, she couldn't help it. She quickly stood up, attempting to walk away again.
@IncarnatedFury ~ on her knees that were against her chest,continuing to cry.
@IncarnatedFury "Yes I can love someone.. And if you're here to argue about that then just leave me alone.. " Alexis laid her head down~
@IncarnatedFury ~ cry even harder so she quickly covered her face with her hands.
@IncarnatedFury "B-Because, I'm in love with someone who doesn't love me back..And that person is you" Just talking about it made her~
@IncarnatedFury "Zero,if you don't want me then fucking tell me...I want to be all yours and yours only..." 
@LipsofSorrow "Yup! So,sis what do you wanna do? We can do whatever you'd like!"
@IncarnatedFury She slowly moved her hands away from her,her mascara ran down her face as she looked up at him
@IncarnatedFury "I'm being honest, Why can't you believe me? Hmm?" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ and it broke her heart that he didn't.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis didn't notice him as she continued to cry,slowly bringing her knees to her chest. She knew he didn't feel the same~
@LipsofSorrow "I may seem like a bitch but,I'm not...Honestly!" Alexis flashed a smile at her.
to a perfect land
of sex and poetry
dominance and submission
wine and music 
food and dance
It would…
from everyone
and come to me
your body wild
with breathless desire
that has you in it
@LipsofSorrow "Yes I do!" Alexis laughed and wrapped her arms around her sister
@LipsofSorrow "I don't ignore you dear sister of mine!  Come here and hug your sister! "
@IncarnatedFury "Would you ever consider being mine,Z?" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ she had never felt this way and this boy was making her cry.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis didn't notice as she buried her face in her hands,Was she about to cry because of him? Fuck,she was crying~
@IncarnatedFury  "Fuck Yeah...Damn,I wish you were mine..." 
@IncarnatedFury Sweet mother of GOD...You are too fucking hot..." 
@IncarnatedFury ~ roughly but, she didn't care she just kept walking until she found a empty bench and sat down in it.
@IncarnatedFury ~ She just wanted to be alone at the moment. Alexis just pushed people out of her way occasionally getting pushed back~
@IncarnatedFury Alexis didn't say anything else only just walked out of the store and through the crowd of people in the crowded mall~
@IncarnatedFury ~ isles in the store. She wasn't lying, she did love him and always have and probably always will.
@IncarnatedFury "I'm not lying... This is something that I can't lie about" She kept her eye's down as she continued to walk down random~
@IncarnatedFury ~ I am deeply in love with you,Zero..."
@IncarnatedFury ~ Alexis looked down at the floor as she continued to speak "I know you probably don't feel the same nor care.. But,~
@IncarnatedFury "Because, When I'm with you I don't see anyone else..It's like we're in our own little world..It's not impossible, Zero.."~
@IncarnatedFury ~ something different, It was something Mortals called 'Love' which something that sins weren't suppose to have.
@IncarnatedFury ~ stupid, she knew he didn't care nor ever would. It was stupid of her to feel that way,it wasn't Greed no this was ~
@IncarnatedFury "I think I've fallen in love with you....Fuck! Forget I said anything " Alexis quickly walked ahead of him. God,she was so~
@IncarnatedFury ~ that he didn't care how she felt.
@IncarnatedFury "Zero...Can I be honest... You make me happy..I know we fight a lot but, I just..." Alexis just stopped speaking,figuring ~
@NightHowler_ IT DESERVES AN AWARD!
@NightHowler_ YASSSSS
@PerishAndDecay "Well, do you consider us friends? I mean have you ever had a friend before in the first place?"
@PerishAndDecay ~ him a small smile.
@PerishAndDecay "So what if you're an old man? And I'm nice to you because I consider you my friend.."  Alexis looked over at him,giving~
@PerishAndDecay ~ sat down in the sand,her eye's on the waves that were crashing on the shore.
@PerishAndDecay "Wow.. Damn,that's a really long time.." Alexis kept a hold of his hand,slowly intertwining their fingers as she~
@CalmestVirtue "Well,Thank you.."
@CalmestVirtue "What?"
#SeductiveSaturday 
@PerishAndDecay Once they arrived at the beach,she flashed him a bright smile "How long has it been since you've been to the beach?"
@Temperantia_ "Have I ever told you that you look /so/ sexy wearing those glasses?"Alexis continued to giggle quietly as she poked his cheek
@PerishAndDecay "Good,I'm glad you find my plan great..."Alexis laid her head right back on his shoulder as they headed to the beach.
@Temperantia_ "Yeah,why wouldn't I be?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,it is true,James..But, I'm glad you're the only one that likes me"
@PerishAndDecay "I'd like to go to the beach,we could watch the waves crash onto the shore... If you'd like, Alexander"
@IncarnatedFury "You're honestly happy,Z?" Alexis rose a curious brow as she kept her attention onto him.
@Temperantia_ "Thank you, James...Honestly no one really fancys me but you" Alexis laughed and kissed his forehead.
"I hope it was because, that'd be weird if it wasn't " 
"James, look!  A gaint cuddly bear! Were you in this suit when you hugged me?" 
@Temperantia_ "You're so sweet to me and I don't know why,James" Alexis spoke after she had slowly pulled away from his lips.
@PerishAndDecay ~ of his hand.
@PerishAndDecay "Yay you're smiling! I feel /so/ happy that you're smiling for once!" Alexis started to walk once again, taking a hold~
@Temperantia_ "No one has ever said that to me..." Alexis quickly wrapped her arms around him,kissing him on the lips softly.
@Temperantia_ "So,Tell me...James how much do you like me?"
"For Pride since he loves my breasts" 
@PerishAndDecay ~ wider.
@PerishAndDecay "Ooh, Is that a tiny little smile I see?" Alexis laughed and made a silly facial expression to try to make his faint smile ~
@Temperantia_ "Awww, Thank you,My gaint cuddly bear!"
@Temperantia_ "I think I'm hideous "
@LipsofSorrow "Yeah, I mean I've had feelings for someone but, Eh..."
@FacelessFrench "Everything was beautiful and simple unlike now"
@PerishAndDecay Alexis stood on her tip toes and poked his cheek in attempts to make him at least smile a little.
@PerishAndDecay "I can't help but worry about you,Alexander and I'm sorry that I do..I just can't help it,I guess..."
@Temperantia_ "Fine,only if you say so..."
"I honestly miss the 50's and 60's...I felt the most happiest during those times" 
@LipsofSorrow "I've been looking for as long as I have existed, and no luck.."
@Temperantia_ "Nooooooooo"
@PerishAndDecay "Really?  But, weren't you happy?"Alexis stopped walking,only to look at him while she lifted her head off of his shoulder.
"Is it bad that I want a guy who'll make me laugh? Or am I just being too picky? Ugh"
@Temperantia_ "Nooo, It's hideous!"
@PerishAndDecay "Oh my,I didn't know that..Well,I hope you two get back together, Alexander. I'd like to see you happy and in love again"
@PerishAndDecay "Oh,I'm terribly sorry to hear that.. Was she a mortal by any chance?"
@PerishAndDecay "What changed?  Did something bad happen to he or she,Alexander?"
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,but so what?  And I like seeing you happy as Well,Zero" Alexis looked over at him,giving him a small smile.
@Temperantia_ "This face isn't adorable! " 
"He makes me laugh"<KISS MARK><RABBIT FACE> 
@PerishAndDecay "So,Be honest when I ask you this...Have you loved someone before,Alexander?  If you don't mind me by asking "
@PerishAndDecay "Good,I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.. " Alexis looked over at him,smiling brightly are him.
"I don't think so! You're the cute one not me!" 
"Nooo,you're way cuter than me!" 
@PerishAndDecay "Yeah, I haven't had fun in a while.. I really hope you don't mind me laying on your shoulder,Alexander "
@LipsofSorrow || She's beautiful!  Just had to say it,I think she'd be a good sadness!
"Because, Black on me is wonderful and beautiful" 
@Temperantia_ "You're sooo cute,My gaint cuddly bear!"
@PerishAndDecay "Good,I shall call you Alexander since most don't call you that at all!" Alexis laid her head on his shoulder as they walked
@PerishAndDecay "Nope, you're the perfect person to hang out with Alexander!  Or do you want me to call you Death like the others do?"
"I think I look better in black,don't you think?" 
@PerishAndDecay "Yay! I'm glad you're actually hanging out with me! I didn't think you'd want to honestly!"
@PerishAndDecay "Hmmm.. How about you and I go to like a butterfly garden or something!?! "
@PerishAndDecay "/I/ want to do something you'd like to do for once! I want you to have fun and smile!"
"Victory dance since Alexander finally wants to hang out with me!!" 
@PerishAndDecay "Okay,So you and I are gonna do something fun for once to pass time!"Alexis giggled and looked over at him,smiling brightly
@PerishAndDecay "Yay! Let's do it! I'm glad you like me idea!" Alexis smiled brightly as took a hold of his hand "Come on! Let's find him"
@PerishAndDecay "Ooh! You smiled for a second,Yay!!!!"
@Temperantia_ "Yeah,I like it a lot!" Alexis mumbled against his lips as she gladly kissed him back.
"Here Alexander I have an idea on what to do to Anger!" 
@Temperantia_ "Of course you can call me your sugar!  I like that nickname just as much as I like you,James!"
"I don't want to die...I'll never see James again if I do..."
@IncarnatedFury "Nah,I don't think so,Zero" Alexis shrugged her shoulders as she flashed a bright smile at the couple who walked past them.
@Temperantia_ "Aww, I love it! It's just perfect,My gaint cuddly bear!" Alexis kept her bright smile as she looked at him
@Temperantia_ "No,I don't!" Alexis finally stopped kissing all over his face by placing her soft lips on his,kissing him softly and gently
@Temperantia_ "Like what? I don't need a cute nickname,sweetie!" Alexis continued to laugh as she kept planting kisses all over his face.
@IncarnatedFury "I do know because, I do feel what true love is.. " 
@Temperantia_ "You truly make me happy...My gaint cuddly bear!" Alexis giggled and pressed various kisses all over his face
@IncarnatedFury "You are you just need to understand the true feeling of love..." 
@Temperantia_ "And I like you James.. A lot actually" Alexis slowly pressed a small kiss upon his lips as she smiled brightly.
@PerishAndDecay "Apparently, but there's Nothing I can do..Why would you want to kill me anyway?"
@PerishAndDecay "And? Should I care what you do to Anger anymore? He's not mine so why should I give a shit?"
@PerishAndDecay "Whatever just think about how nice I was to you and how I cared about you  whenever you come to kill me "
@PerishAndDecay ~ be nice and be your friend or anything! "
@PerishAndDecay "Ugh..You are so stubborn!  You know what? Go ahead go end everything.. It's not like you have someone who's trying to~
@NightHowler_ FUCK YEAH!!!!
@PerishAndDecay "Alexander, just please don't let Skuld take your feelings away..They are wonderful things to have and I care about you"
Maybe I should just be a Greedy bitch rather than be nice and caring. I'm something everyone wants and I  love that! 
@PerishAndDecay "No,it wouldn't be the best at all...I know you're hurt to see her throwing herself at Zero but,there's Nothing you can do"
@Temperantia_ "You do? I'm kinda shocked well.. Everyone wants me but, no one really likes me,James"
@PerishAndDecay ~ so,just move on.."
@PerishAndDecay "Alexander.. I wouldn't want all your remaining emotions wiped away..I know you love her but, she doesn't see that~
@IncarnatedFury Are you sure about that?  I want to be loved not just wanted...I want to be with someone " 
@IncarnatedFury "Only if you were mine,Z" 
@Temperantia_ "You better be...And,if I see you hang out with my sister Lust then we'll never hang out again, got it?"
@IncarnatedFury "Maybe, Just blood,Z..." 
@IncarnatedFury "Anything!  As long as It's fun!" 
@IncarnatedFury "Awww,Pretty please?  I'm dying of boredom! " 
@Temperantia_ "Yay! I better not hear anyone else calling you their gaint cuddly bear though!"

@Temperantia_ "Well, you're officially my gaint cuddly bear! "Alexis continued to laugh and look up at him with a big smile upon her face.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis kept her bright smile as she looked up at him "You're too fucking cute, Z"
@Temperantia_ ~ giggle quietly at her own words.
@Temperantia_ Alexis couldn't help but,smile brightly at his words "You're so sweet and adorable.. Like, a cute little puppy!" She started~
@Temperantia_ ~ nice to me even though I'm a sin"
@Temperantia_ "And, you're one of those few,James... You're honestly one of the best guys I know and I wanna Thank you for being so~
@NightHowler_ I JUST WANNA KEEP IT FOREVER!!!!!!!
@IncarnatedFury "Thank you,Z" Alexis quickly placed her lips on his as her way of thanking him.
@Temperantia_ ~ her head on his chest as she cuddled up close to him.
@Temperantia_ "Thank God.. I thought all men do,I mean from past relationships I've had made me think that all men are alike." She laid~
@NightHowler_ I KNOW, UGH SO SAD! <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
@PerishAndDecay "You'd help me, Alexander?  But,why?" Alexis quickly wrapped her arms around him,pulling him into a hug "You're so nice "
@NightHowler_ I KNOW RIGHT?!  I WISH I COULD HAVE DAT NICE WALL OUTLET ALL TO MYSELF. UGH
@Temperantia_ "Wow, usually men are just wanting to skip dinner... I like your thinking, James.. " Alexis laughed and kissed his cheek.
@NightHowler_ IT'S SO NICE LOOKING MY GOD, I WANT A WALL OUTLET LIKE THAT! #goalsaf
@PerishAndDecay "Temperance seems to like me I think but, I don't know..  God,love is such a complicated emotion.."

@PerishAndDecay "Exactly, I mean I can see why men would treat me like a sextoy but, that's not the way I should be treated..."
"I feel /so/ fucking ugly in glasses..Like can someone just set me on fire?" 
@PerishAndDecay ~ is that too much to ask for? Am I just too picky or something?"

@PerishAndDecay "I have plenty of friends...They aren't what I want in a man"
@CcldSadist "Oh,Really?  You'd be /all/ mine?" 
@PerishAndDecay "Don't you think I've been trying? Hell, no one fancys me in any way"
@CcldSadist "Because, I'm one Greedy bitch. I want a boy that'll be mine and mine only and most don't want that" 
@PerishAndDecay "I don't think I'll find anyone... Trust me they wouldn't stick around for long since I am one Greedy bitch."
@CcldSadist "I don't have one.. Nobody sticks around me for long and you're welcome,Sweetie" 
@PerishAndDecay "Alexander, you're sooo nice! You've made me feel a whole lot better."
@CcldSadist "I'm shocked...A handsome man like you usually have a girlfriend.. "
@IncarnatedFury 
@CcldSadist "You're such a gentleman.. Your girlfriend is very lucky to have someone such as yourself."
@PerishAndDecay "Eh, That's all him but, in general I don't think anyone would want to be /all/ mine"
@CcldSadist "Well, Thank you,cutie!" 
@PerishAndDecay "It sucks....Ugh It makes me question if I'm good enough for anyone ugh.."
"It seems everyone wants Anger.."
Just for My cute Z, He just goes crazy whenever I wear black.. 
@IncarnatedFury "Thank you, baby.." Alexis smiled brightly as she continued to look through the baby books on the shelf.
@SeventhSinPride 
@SeventhSinPride "Hmmm.. Are you sure,Pride?" 
@SeventhSinPride "Only if I could make you /all/ mine" 
@IncarnatedFury "Could you go get the bottles,baby? Pretty please?" Alexis asked as she stuck out her bottom lip.
@SeventhSinPride 
@SeventhSinPride "You sure can..."

@SeventhSinPride "Why would I wanna bite it off? That's disturbing.. I'd like to do something else with it though but, ah Well.."
@IncarnatedFury "Perfect.. " Alexis tossed the book into their buggy as she looked around the isle.
@SeventhSinPride "Good,It sucks that you don't want anyone touching your crotch though" 
"And I see Pride is sexy as always but,not as sexy as me!" 
"God..I miss hanging out with Alexander...."
"I'd rather be badass than hot...But, as you can obviously see I am both" 
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah.. So,Do you see any that look like it would help us at all?"
@Temperantia_ Alexis didn't bother pulling away from him as she slowly slipped her tongue inside of his mouth.
@Temperantia_ Alexis placed her soft lips on his, kissing him rather roughly and passionately than softly and gently.
@VirtueDiligence "Awww, that's so sweet, Diligence..."Alexis smiled brightly and continued to kiss his neck.
@IncarnatedFury "Hmm....I don't know,maybe we should get like a baby book that tells us or something?"
@Temperantia_ "Aww, You're soooo fucking sweet,James!" She exclaimed as she smiled brightly.
@PerishAndDecay "Because... I like you, it doesn't matter if you end people's lives or want to end all life to me..I consider you a friend"
@PerishAndDecay "Amazing... You're amazing..." Alexis gave him a small smile as she looked at him with her green eye's.
@PerishAndDecay "I've been busy, honestly and I would never find you annoying, Alexander... Youre the total opposite.. "
@PerishAndDecay "God..They're fucking amazing... And I know,It's been awhile.."
@PerishAndDecay "Holy shit...Those tattoos are just... " 
@IncarnatedFury Once she noticed the fury in the others around them,she quickly looked over at Zero still not saying a word.
@VirtueDiligence ~ down his jawline then down to his neck.
@VirtueDiligence "Again? I can't be /that/ hot for you to want to go at it again.." She continued to laugh as she pressed small kisses~
@IncarnatedFury Alexis didn't say a word to him,still acting as if he wasn't even there at the time. Only hummed a quiet tune to herself.
@Temperantia_ "/No/ I'm far, very far from adorable, James..Trust me" She couldn't help but,laugh again.
|| Everyone should totally check this RPG @HellishDaysRPG! They have plenty of roles open in all things horror! It's amazing honestly!
@Temperantia_ "Awww, You're too fucking adorable.. " She couldn't help but let out a small laugh.
@VirtueDiligence As soon as he lifted her, she quickly wrapped her legs around his waist "Do you really want to,Diligence?"
@IncarnatedFury ~ even there while she looked at the decorations.
@IncarnatedFury "You don't have to act like an asshole all the fucking time....God" She rolled her eye's and pretended as if he wasn't t~
@IncarnatedFury "We need decorations... For her nursery, Z..Then the crib and other stuff she'll need.."
@VirtueDiligence She tugged on his lower lip gently as she continued to kiss him,her hands slowly roaming his body in the process.
@IncarnatedFury She kept her arms around him for a moment longer before pulling away
@IncarnatedFury She slowly wrapped her arms around him,pulling him into a small hug not saying another word.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis let out a small sigh as she took a hold of Zero's hand "But,what if she does?"
@VirtueDiligence Alexis didn't bother pulling away this time,she just kept her lips against his as she continued to kiss him.
@Temperantia_ ~ pressed a small kiss upon the top of his head.
@Temperantia_ Alexis  ordered the cheese pizza they wanted before hanging up and sliding her phone back in her Jean pocket.She then~

Your TL bores you? Start a SL or casual RP or read what solos people post.
@IncarnatedFury "Good.. But,What if she hates us for it? I don't want our daughter to hate us.."
@VirtueDiligence She couldn't help but smile against his lips as she kissed him back with just as much passion.
@IncarnatedFury "What if she wants to be with a pathetic mortal?  Should we kill he or she? Would you kill he or she,Z?"
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah, especially a mortal.. I'll fucking kill them..."
@IncarnatedFury "She is gonna be /so/badass.. Honestly I bet she'll be more like you than me,Z" She laughed and looked down at his hand.
@IncarnatedFury "That'd be amazing!  God,her room is gonna be badass!"
@IncarnatedFury She stopped walking and looked over at him "Real Blood?Now,that's what I'm talking about!" She laughed quietly and smiled
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah, I know.." She grabbed the red paint and put it in the buggy "Now for decorations.. "
@IncarnatedFury When she heard his sigh she looked back at him "You don't have to be here if you don't want to be,Z"
@Temperantia_ "Oh my...Uh, I'll just order cheese then..." She laughed at his words as she took out her phone.
@VirtueDiligence "Good..I'm glad you'd like that sweetie.. " She kissed him with passion before pulling away.
@IncarnatedFury "Duh,It'd be perfect with blood red!" She smiled brightly and went down an isle where the paint was.
@Temperantia_ "Well,then Pizza it is! So,What kind of pizza would you like since there's a lot to choose from!'
@VirtueDiligence "Only if you want to, Diligence.. " She rose a brow curious at what he'd say in response to her comment
@IncarnatedFury "Good, I don't think anyone else has come up with an idea like that before."

@VirtueDiligence "Yay! Then maybe some other things,Diligence?" She gave him a playful wink and smile.

@VirtueDiligence "What should we do now,Love?" Alexis rose a brow as she made a small distance between their lips.
@IncarnatedFury "Well, sadly I can't do much killing which is a pain in the ass" She let out a small sigh before speaking "But,okay."
@VirtueDiligence "I love you so much, Sweetie " She muttered against his soft lips as she kissed him deeper than before.
@IncarnatedFury "Of course,We'll protect her from anyone or anything in this horrible world.." She smiled down at him widely.
@VirtueDiligence "Good,and I'm all yours Diligence not anyone else's.. " She continued to kiss him passionately and intensity.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis giggled quietly. This was the most cutest thing she had ever saw Zero do in all their lifes, honestly.
@VirtueDiligence "Are you all mine, Diligence?  In a romantic way not a greedy way,sweetie "
@IncarnatedFury "It's fucking weird but, I like it..They say that a baby can hear what you say when you're this far along"

@VirtueDiligence "Yes,I'm Sure.." She kissed him passionately yet softly and gently as usual.
@Temperantia_ "Yeah, what would you like to eat,James?" She rose a curious brow as she looked up at him.
@Temperantia_ She moved around slightly so she could face him as she kissed his lips slowly and gently before pulling away.
#FF @IncarnatedFury @LostNecromancer @VirtueDiligence @Temperantia_ @SeventhSinPride @Violent_Sinner
@Temperantia_ "Aww, You're so sweet,James..I'm not even /that/ hot at all but, thank you" She kept her smile as she looked back at the t.v
@VirtueDiligence "But, in order for us to be together I need to change for us.." She smiled slightly as she wrapped her arms around him
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,we need to go shopping" She took a hold of his hand and began to walk down the street with him.
@Temperantia_ "God,So you find me hot?  That's a shocker sweetie" She continued to laugh once again as she looked over at him.
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,Ugh..We have to shop for cute girl stuff! Yay!" She smiled brightly "I bet as soon as you see her, you'll love her"
@IncarnatedFury She rolled her eye's and kissed him roughly before pulling away.
@IncarnatedFury "I'm glad you like it..I'll call her Kat for short" She smiled and looked up at him.
@Temperantia_ "You told my daughter that her mother was hot?" She couldn't help but continue to laugh at what he said.
@IncarnatedFury "Well....Hmm.. How about Katherine?  I mean you have a say in it as well,Zero..."
@VirtueDiligence ~ his soft addicting lips.
@VirtueDiligence "Yes, I'm being serious love...If I want to be with you I have to change for the better.." She smiled slightly against ~
@Temperantia_ She laughed and shook her head "So,I see you've been talking to my daughter Katherine am I correct?"
@IncarnatedFury "So,what should we name her? I mean did you have any names in mind or were you hoping for a boy.
@VirtueDiligence "Well,then I guess I'm coming to live with you" She smiled brightly against his soft lips as she kissed him again.
@IncarnatedFury "I won't... I know you shouldn't forgive me but, I'm glad you did..." She let out a small sigh as she looked up at him.
@IncarnatedFury She stopped walking only to wrap her arms around him and pulled him into a hug "I'm sorry for being a bitch."
@Temperantia_ "No,James...I find normal people boring.. So,please don't try to act like a normal person "
@IncarnatedFury "I...Just forget about it.." She started to get upset for some reason,her guess was hormones.  "Forget I said anything.. "
@IncarnatedFury "I don't hate you...It's the total opposite of hating you, Zero...I..." She stopped speaking,letting out a small sigh.
@IncarnatedFury "Just stop..Filling my head up with lies!" She tried to pull away from him. "Just fucking leave me alone and stop!"
@IncarnatedFury "Why....Why are you caring about me so, much?...I don't understand.. " Her voice became a low whisper as she spoke.
@IncarnatedFury "Just let me go!" Her voice echoed through the crowd of people that were walking pass them "Zero,just let me go.."
@IncarnatedFury "Why the Fuck not?! You've left me alone before so, why now?!" She tried to move away from him as much as she could.
@IncarnatedFury "Just leave me the fuck alone, Zero..." She kept walking away from him as she pushed people out of her way in the process.
@Temperantia_ "Uh....No,but it's adorable so I don't mind" She continued to laugh as she turned her attention back onto the movie.
@IncarnatedFury "Oh,fuck off.."She threw the money at the woman before slamming open the door that led out of the building.
@IncarnatedFury ~ out of her way and out the door.
@IncarnatedFury "How the hell am I pushing it?! I'm not the one who has fucking Anger issues, Zero!" She screamed as she pushed him~
@Temperantia_ She laughed when she took her eye's off of the t.v screen and looked over at him "What are you doing?"
@IncarnatedFury "Why?! Why are you freaking out because, I decided to take off the gown in front of him?!'
@VirtueDiligence "I love you so,so,so, much,Diligence.. " She smiled and kissed him passionately.
@Temperantia_ Alexis smiled brightly as she watched the rest of the horror movie with him. She was glad she suggested them doing this
@IncarnatedFury "What? It's not like he hasn't seen a woman naked before..Calm down" She laughed and slowly slipped on her clothes.
@Temperantia_ "That's exactly what I was thinking,James" She laughed and laid her head on his chest,listening to his heartbeat.
@IncarnatedFury She nodded and quickly slipped off the gown, not caring if the doctor saw her or not, she hated that ugly gown.
@Temperantia_ "Yeah, Let's finish watching the movie then maybe we could do something else.. "
@VirtueDiligence ",Then you and I can be together forever! " She smiled brightly as she kissed his forehead.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis took a moment before, sitting up. Letting out a nervous sigh.

Everybody : Taken <KISS> 

Me : <PEDESTRIAN>
@IncarnatedFury She them looked over at the doctor and nurse "Yeah.. please tell us the gender of the child"
@IncarnatedFury She nodded slowly still shocked well, rather speechless as she then looked over at Zero "Do you wanna know,Zero?"
@IncarnatedFury She tightened the grip on his hand as she kept her eye's on the screen. Holy shit...She was going to be a mother..Fuck.
@IncarnatedFury "Are you okay Zero?" Alexis quickly looked over at him slowly raising a brow.
@IncarnatedFury She slowly looked over at the screen and smiled brightly once she saw the feet and head of the child.
@IncarnatedFury ~late to change her mind now.
@IncarnatedFury "Uh...Okay" She was nervous as she looked over at Zero,she didn't want the doctor to do anything like that but, it was too~
@IncarnatedFury She nodded slowly and done what the doctor told her to do,looking over at Zero with a nervous facial expression.
@VirtueDiligence "Baby, I'll try to change my ways just for you,alright?  It'll be extremely hard but...It'll be worth it,right?"
@Temperantia_ "I really enjoyed that...But, This can't go any further for now...."  She moved off of him,giving him a small smile
@VirtueDiligence "No,it's not..I sound like a dying seal and I'm being honest"
@Temperantia_ She tugged on his hair gently just incase he didn't want her to do that. She kept her lips on his before slowly pulling away.
@IncarnatedFury "I don't know...A couple of weeks or so?" Alexis shrugged as she kept her focus onto the doctor.
@VirtueDiligence "/No/ it's not! Why would you say that it is,love?"
@Temperantia_ She smiled against his lips as she continued to kiss him,running her fingers through his hair.
@IncarnatedFury "No..I'm not in this " she said before looking over at the doctor, waiting for the man to speak.
@IncarnatedFury "And?  It's ugly and now it makes me ugly... " She rolled her eye's and looked away from him.
@Temperantia_ She rose a brow slightly when he kissed her gently since she kinda was rather kissing him roughly than softly and gently.
@VirtueDiligence "/No/ it's not..." She continued to laugh, pushing him away slightly to make him stop
@Temperantia_ She didn't think about pulling away from him this time, she just kept her lips on his as she continued to kiss him.
@IncarnatedFury "Ok... Its ugly though..." She sighed and took off her clothes then slipped on The gown.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis looked up and over at the nurse "Uh,where's the doctor? And why the hell is this taking so long?"
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh,what the hell is taking so long.." She rolled her eye's and let out an aggravated groan,growing rather impatient.
@IncarnatedFury She walked until she reached the empty room,sitting down as she waited rather patiently for the doctor to come.
@IncarnatedFury She let go of his hand since he had seem distant, she then stood up when her name was called, making her way to the nurse.
@IncarnatedFury "Alright... Whatever" She shrugged her shoulders as she shook her head slowly.
@IncarnatedFury "Are you Sure that you're okay?.." She looked over at him,raising a curious brow as she looked down at their hands.
@IncarnatedFury ~ so,the woman opened up a spot for her as Alexis looked over at Zero.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis looked into the woman's eye's, using the power of greed to say otherwise to the woman,She was under Alexis control~
@IncarnatedFury She looked around before going to the receptionist desks,signing in without even saying a word to the lady.
@IncarnatedFury She playfully rolled her eye's as they arrived to the doctors office,looking over at him before entering the building.
@IncarnatedFury "Just shut up" She quickly pressed her soft lips against his,kissing him roughly before pulling away
@IncarnatedFury Nah,I don't feel like it 
@IncarnatedFury "Zero..Calm down, alright?" She took ahold of his hand,intertwining their fingers as they walked.
@IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury "A couple of blocks away...Let go of me" She moved away from his grasp as she followed him.

@IncarnatedFury "In about two days..." She sighed and looked over at him.
@IncarnatedFury I can protect myself... 
"Deattthhh, I need you for a moment!"
@IncarnatedFury Why would you even care about me or it? Hmm? 
@IncarnatedFury God,you're such an ass..Maybe,I shouldn't ever let you see that certain thing ever..

@IncarnatedFury "Same, do they like know or something? " 
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah, I mean.. I think we're suppose to.." She was utterly clueless when it came down to this.
Oh my GOD,can I ask why everyone is talking about pregnancy..
"Death and Chasity would make a cute couple.  Just saying... "
"Well, thank you?"
"Everyone's talking about pregnancy and I'm sitting here like" 
@IncarnatedFury "Of course, I did"
"And that's because, you /love/ me" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@VirtueDiligence "/Stop/ That kinda tickles, sweetie!" She continued to laugh as she tried to make him stop.
"Whoo!  I was Diligences first.. And he loved it"
@IncarnatedFury "Z, you're fucking crazy.. But, I like that about you" She laughed and sat down on the edge of the bed,looking over at him
@IncarnatedFury "I can't believe you trashed our room like this...."  She took a long look around, letting out a small aggravated sigh.
@IncarnatedFury "You don't always have to protect me,Z...I can handle myself.. And why the hell is our room trashed?!"
@IncarnatedFury "Why wouldn't I be?" She slowly wrapped her arm's around him as well,smiling slightly.
@VirtueDiligence "Its /totally / possible!!!" She continued to laugh as she kissed his nose back.
@IncarnatedFury ~ complicated at time's.
@IncarnatedFury "What... " She looked over at the trashed room then back at him. Why did he trash their room like that? Ugh,he was so~
@IncarnatedFury ~ hotel.
@IncarnatedFury She kept walking until she was out of the hotel. She walked around town for about five hours before coming back to the ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ quickly opened the door,stepping out and slamming it shut. God, her emotions were everywhere at the time.
@IncarnatedFury She pushed him away from her as she looked at him "Whatever.. I'm going for a walk, you better not follow me " She ~
@IncarnatedFury "Are you trying to tell me what I can or can't do? Because, I'll leave right now and you wont stop me.."
@IncarnatedFury She let out a small sigh "Zero, I never said you had to help me if you didn't want to..."
@IncarnatedFury "This fucking sucks..But,I guess it's kinda worth it...Don't you think?" She looked over at him,raising a brow .
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh.. I feel so, weak now like I can't do anything.. " She sighed and stayed where she was for a moment.
@IncarnatedFury "Not for a while.. " She hated what he said but,.it needed to be said. "And Sadly..I can't get into any fights either..."
@IncarnatedFury "Got it..But, you can't just randomly leave me whenever you get mad at me.." She laughed and shook her head slowly.
@IncarnatedFury "I don't know...We just act like we usually do.." She shrugged and kissed his forehead gently.
@Temperantia_ She slowly pulled away only to look at him and flash a bright smile.
@IncarnatedFury "They'll be simply perfect.. Selfish, psychotic, bipolar.. " She smiled brightly.
@IncarnatedFury ~ them,I'll fucking kill them"
@IncarnatedFury She laughed and shook her head. "Honestly, I'd think we make pretty bad ass parents. Let someone try to lay a fingers on ~
@IncarnatedFury She smiled slightly at how selfish that sounded "So..I mean, do you think we're ready to be parents?"
@Temperantia_ She kept her soft lips on his as she continued to kiss him. She arms wrapping her arms around his neck.
@IncarnatedFury She was honestly shocked at his words,you could tell by her facial expression that she was. "Really?  You want to help me?"

@IncarnatedFury "Don't you think I would make a horrible mother!!  And Tests don't lie,Zero!" She looked away from him not even wanting ~
@Temperantia_ "Probably some horror movie that I'll find.." She shrugged and leaned over, kissing him with passion yet rather softly as well
@Temperantia_ "If you want...Or we could like make out or something " She laughed and looked up at him,waiting for a response
@VirtueDiligence "no,it's possible!" She laughed and shook her head slowly

@VirtueDiligence "God,I love you /so/ much, Diligence.. " She smiled and kissed him passionately.
@IncarnatedFury "Mm.. Fuck,Z..."  She moaned out as she slowly moved her blood covered body against his slowly.
@IncarnatedFury She quickly unclipped her bra and slipped off her shorts, not caring about the blood on his skin,she liked it.
@VirtueDiligence "Baby, What if I can't change? Like,what if it's too late for me to change my ways?"
@IncarnatedFury She quickly kissed him back,with as much passion she could do. She then ripped his shirt off of him
@IncarnatedFury ~ the man's body.
@IncarnatedFury "Now how about that other thing?.." She gave him a playful wink as she walked over to him,getting on her knees to look at~
@IncarnatedFury "Wow...Z...That is fucking awesome!" She smiled deviously, and clapped as if it was extremely entertaining to her.
@IncarnatedFury She smiled brightly as she watched him,.God, it was absolutely thrilling to with in her opinion.
"That moment when you're baeless " 
@Temperantia_ "I don't know...I mean there's really nothing I actually can do at the moment "
"I just might go with Diligence and Skuld.. " 
@IncarnatedFury She quickly stabbed the man in the arm before throwing him onto the ground,tossing it back to him"Take your anger out on him
@VirtueDiligence "Oh,Diligence.. " She quickly wrapped her arms around him,pulling him into a tight hug "God,i love you..."
@IncarnatedFury "Zero.. " She quickly pushed the man off of her as she sat up, waiting for him to hand her his knife.
@LethargicBeaut  "She's just acting bad ass and a wannabe sin.. Nothing special, you can go back to sleep"
@VirtueDiligence "Diligence.. I'm a sin! I'm bad for you,I don't want to hurt you or even corrupt you!" She looked down at the floor.
@IncarnatedFury ~ him,the man was already on top of her on the hotel bed.
@IncarnatedFury Once she took a hold of his hand, she led him back to her hotel. Waiting for Zero to get there, while she was waiting on ~
@VirtueDiligence "Selfish?  That sounds greedy of you...Thats it Diligence you have to stay away from me..." She quickly moved away from him
@IncarnatedFury "Zero,Death is just getting to me..That's all.."
@VirtueDiligence "How? I mean what would that do?" She sighed and looked over at him.
"But, I could never leave my family.. even if I wanted to..My brother Anger cares about me alot.. "
"Why do you want me???"
@PerishAndDecay "I want him to be who he is...I wouldn't want to him to change at all..He doesn't care if I'm a sin or not..He loves me"
@PerishAndDecay "Look, I can't change and none of the other sins can either.. We will always be like this.."

@PerishAndDecay She hesitated before speaking "Y-Yeah, I guesss I do..But, I know that and I don't know where she is..Ya know what?~
@PerishAndDecay "Who do you think it is?"
@PerishAndDecay "I know...It feels like love and I just... " She let out a sigh.
@VirtueDiligence "If only other people saw me other than a deadly sin,I wouldn't be facing Death.."
@PerishAndDecay "I do feel love...Trust me I do"
@PerishAndDecay "It's not that easy!  "
@PerishAndDecay "So,there's nothing I can do?..."
@PerishAndDecay "I have so much to live for...I just can't die..I just can't. " She couldn't help but, bursts into tears.

@IncarnatedFury ~ letting him kiss her neck. She hated it but, she had to pretend she was enjoying it.
@IncarnatedFury She moved away from Zero and over to the man,giving him a charming smile. She let him put his hands all over her vessel~
@PerishAndDecay "After all this time?  After me attempting to /help/ you? 
@PerishAndDecay "Death...Please? '
@PerishAndDecay "So,you're just gonna let me die!? After I've been nice to your ass!" 
@IncarnatedFury "Good because, I have to trick him into coming back to the hotel with me..So,try not to get jealous alright?"
@PerishAndDecay "Yeah,a little...Go on" she patiently waited for him to continue
@PerishAndDecay "What's my fate..? I need to know,Death"
@IncarnatedFury ~ I like a challenge.. "
@IncarnatedFury She took a small look around before pointing at a young man "Hmm, what about him baby? I mean he'll put up a fight but~
@PerishAndDecay " What's the good news and wanna go get a drink with me?"
@IncarnatedFury Even this guy? 
@IncarnatedFury ~ and pulled away from him when he slapped her ass.
@IncarnatedFury "Mmm, I like the sound of that..I wanna torture someone, then possibly Fuck while covered in their blood,Z" She smirked~
@PerishAndDecay "What did Zero do now?"
"I hope Zero doesn't get jealous that I'm dancing on another guy" @IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury "Hmmm...What should we do now,Z?" She looked over at him,letting her hand brush past his zipper slowly.
@PerishAndDecay "I was and still am..But,anyway are you still not gonna change your. Mind?"
@PerishAndDecay "And why are you so surprised? "
@PerishAndDecay "Calm yourself Death.. "
@Temperantia_  She cuddled up close to him as she picked up the t.v remote turning it on and flicking on Netflix.
@IncarnatedFury She slowly pulled away rather teasingly and made her way out of the woods and back to where people were at.
@IncarnatedFury I take my compliment Back since you seem to be full of yourself 
@IncarnatedFury And so are you.. 
@IncarnatedFury .... 
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah...That was fucking intense....I liked it..Alot.." She smirked and kissed him roughly.
@IncarnatedFury Oh my GOD,Zero!
@IncarnatedFury When they were finished she slid back on her clothes,taking a look around at the blood on the trees
@IncarnatedFury "Rough...As rough as you can be,Z" She whispered as she slowly moved her body against his.
@IncarnatedFury ~ her tank top and threw it onto the ground.
@IncarnatedFury "Just for me?..." She couldn't help but, smile brightly at his words,she doubted he meant them though. She then lifted up~
@IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury "Fuck, you're like a drug that I'm addicted to..." She quickly started to undo his belt and pants
@Temperantia_ "Oh,alright.. So,ready to cuddle up to each other and watch some random movie on Netflix or something, James?"
@IncarnatedFury She moaned quietly against his soft lips, his touch was pure ecstasy to her. "Z..."She moaned out against his addicting lips
@VirtueDiligence "Yes,baby.. I do think you're a very good boy " She continued to laugh as she smiled brightly.
@IncarnatedFury ~ lip roughly.
@IncarnatedFury She quickly wrapped her legs around his waist as soon as he hoisted her up,keeping her lips on his,tugging on his lower ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ lips "I need you...Right now.."
@IncarnatedFury She quickly pressed her soft lips on his,kissing him roughly and with a great deal of passion before mumbling against his~
@IncarnatedFury She smiled slightly at his words,a wide smirk forming upon her face "Of course.. That's what they all want in life"
@Temperantia_ ~ go out or hang out
@Temperantia_ "I mean we could do that later down the road..But,not now. I'm not like my sister Lust who fucks the first time they ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ idiot for taking things wayyy to far.
@IncarnatedFury "I am? Zero..I'm so sorry for being a total bitch and going over at talking to those guys.." God, she felt like a total ~
@IncarnatedFury "Because, she was prettier than me and I just...."She looked away from him as she spoke with a sad yet mad tone in her voice
@Temperantia_  "Did you think I was meaning sex,James?" She rose a brow as she made her way into the living room.
@VirtueDiligence "Fine, I'll still love you though even if you're my good little boy" She laughed as she leaned in kissing him softly.
@IncarnatedFury ~ she let out a small sigh and stopped following him,figuring he wanted to be alone.
@IncarnatedFury Once she saw him walk away, she quickly followed him "Zero, wait...Look, I got jealous when you looked at her..I just.." ~
@Temperantia_ "If you want...We could do a little more as well.." She shrugged as she unlocked the front door before stepping inside.
@PerishAndDecay "You're not incapable of loving...You're just too fucking blind to see it.."
@Temperantia_ She slowly pulled away and took a hold of his hand once again, leading him towards her house.
@IncarnatedFury ~ into the concrete over and over, she didn't care about anything at the moment.
@IncarnatedFury ~ by the head of her bleach blond hair and threw her onto the ground,she got on top of her so she could slan her face~
@IncarnatedFury "Such an asshole.. " She mumbled as she spotted the girl again the main cause of their fight,she quickly grabbed her~
@IncarnatedFury ~ or did he just not understand how upset and jealous that made her?
@IncarnatedFury "You know what?!  I'm done!" She screamed as she just simply walked away from him,did he not care about her feelings?~
@Temperantia_ She kept her lips on his now kissing him with more passion than before,her fingers entangling in his hair
@IncarnatedFury "Zero!  Fucking stop!" She quickly took a hold of his arm once he pulled out his knife "You fucking winked at her!"
@SeventhSinPride "Thank you,Pride.. But, I know you're only saying that tl make me feel better"
@IncarnatedFury "What?  You winked at that bitch so, I decided to talk to him..Is that a problem?!" She was confused when he jerked her away
@Temperantia_ She smiled slightly against his lips as she gladly kissed him back,gently pushing him against a building wall.
@PerishAndDecay "I said you're in love with Chasity... Admit it,Death..You /love/ her" She laughed and shook her head.
@PerishAndDecay "You're in love with her aren't you?..I can tell you are.."
@PerishAndDecay "/I/ don't care...I just want you to change your mind..Now and I mean it!"
@PerishAndDecay ~ some emotions you have to..You wouldn't be doing this if you didn't.. "
@PerishAndDecay "No...You wouldn't dare.. Death please.. " She let out a sigh as she looked at him "I know deep down inside you can feel~
@Temperantia_ "Well,it was part of it..." She whispered as she  slowly pulled away to make a small distance between their lips.
@PerishAndDecay "Or else what? I'm not doing anything for you..And I clearly don't have to fucking listen to you,Death"
@Temperantia_ ~ gently and softly.
@Temperantia_ She grabbed the collar of his shirt,pulling him close to her as she placed her lips on his. Kissing him passionately yet~
@PerishAndDecay "No...Now,you listen to me"She grabbed his arm once again,gripping onto it tightly "You need to change your mind, right now"
@Temperantia_ "Ugh, that sucks...Welp, I guess my plan is ruined" She let out a fake sigh as she crossed her arms
@PerishAndDecay "Well,I guess I'm standing in your way then...I'd rather you take it out on me than him,Death"
@Temperantia_ ~ a devious smile.
@Temperantia_ "Well,why don't you do another terrible sin so, you can have some fun in Hell for once.." She gave him a playful wink and ~
@PerishAndDecay "I will do something if you do hurt him...He may be a dick at time's but, I still care about him"
@IncarnatedFury ~ at her and started to talk to them,her hand going up and down the man's bicep.
@IncarnatedFury ~ he would do something like that so, she shouldn't be so surprised.  She decided to walk back over to the men that waved~
@IncarnatedFury Once, she saw his actions,she quickly moved away from him and began to walk off crossing her arms as she did. She knew~
@Temperantia_ ~ accepted for who you are and nobody cares about what you've done.
@Temperantia_ "If I'm being honest with you Hell is pretty fun..Probably better than Heaven in my opinion.. Hell is where you can be ~
@PerishAndDecay "How am I suppose to do that, and I swear if you hurt him,Death...."
@Temperantia_ "Good,Anyway.. So,what's it like in Heaven?  I've never been and I'm highly curious.. "
@PerishAndDecay "I mean..We could try to stop him..He does care about his brother's and sister's so, put one of their lifes in danger"
@PerishAndDecay "Well.. Anger is probably gonna try to do that,Death..and there's nothing I can do about that "
@Temperantia_ ~ all and I hope you don't mind walking upstairs or anything "
@Temperantia_ She laughed and took a hold of his hand,leading him outside of the club and down the street "My place is not that far at~
@PerishAndDecay "Just please.. Change your mind,Death.. I know you can't feel any emotions but, will you please? "
@Temperantia_ "Well, you can..It's just no one really pays for something I got.." She stared down at his wallet then up at him
@Temperantia_ ~ "You don't have to pay for any drinks,James?"
@Temperantia_ "Well i was hoping back to my place.. But, we don't have to.." Alexis shrugged and rose a brow when he took out his wallet~
@Temperantia_ "Wanna get outta here?" She muttered against his lips as she gave him another passionate kiss before pulling away slowly.
@Temperantia_ ~ the kiss.
@Temperantia_ She didn't bother pulling away from him or breaking the kiss, she just kept her lips on his adding a little passion into ~
@PerishAndDecay "Yeah,but without mortals on earth, /I/ won't exist!"
@Temperantia_ "I know but still...." She leaned forward, cupping his face gently and kissing him softly yet passionately.
@VirtueDiligence ~ in return for helping me." She gave him a playful wink as she smiled deviously.
@VirtueDiligence "I need your help with killing a mortal.. I know you're a virtue and all but, please..?  I'll give you a little something ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ at him.
@IncarnatedFury "That bitch that just gave you a smile.. " She didn't know why she felt angry that the girl would even think about smiling ~
@VirtueDiligence "Baby....I need help with something and I was thinking maybe you could help me?"
@IncarnatedFury Once Alexis saw a girl flash a smile at Zero,she quickly stopped walking and looked over at the girl "I wanna kill her.."
@IncarnatedFury "aww, pretty please,Z" She stuck out her lower lip and gave him "the puppy dog eyes "
@Temperantia_ "No,I'm not ashamed For them to see me with a virtue but,I don't want them to try to corrupt you or harm you.."
@Temperantia_ "No,I'm Just looking around at the people in case any of my brothers and sisters are here..They usually love bars and such"
@Temperantia_ ~ looked around the bar
@Temperantia_ "/Oh/ So, you're not a virgin.. I thought all virtue's would be since Diligence was before he met me" She shrugged and ~
@Temperantia_ ~ slowly raising.
@Temperantia_ "Wow,so you've never done anything sinful before? So, you're still pure like Chasity.. " She looked at with a curious brow ~
#FF @IncarnatedFury @SeventhSinPride @DesireAndNeed @VirtueDiligence @PerishAndDecay @Temperantia_
@VirtueDiligence "Really?  You do?" She kept her smile as she kissed him on his lips softly.
@Temperantia_ "Have you practised incest with any of your sisters? " She asked in a casual way as she took another shot.
@PerishAndDecay "Well, for one change your mind about killing everyone especially me...Yeah,I know they deserve to die but, still.. "
@PerishAndDecay She didn't care how cold his fingers and hand was,she was still determined to make him change his mind "Apparently not.."
@PerishAndDecay ~ her grip on his arm.
@PerishAndDecay "I'm not letting go,so I guess you'll have to move it for me..." She wasn't planning on giving up so easily, so she kept ~
@PerishAndDecay "Just fucking change your mind..Now! I'd rather you kill me than anyone else..Even the virtue's! "
@PerishAndDecay "Ugh,no..And don't you dare call me Child.. Just please change your mind, okay?!"
@PerishAndDecay "Yes,I have..plenty of time's.. Now, you better change your mind or else.." She kept her grip on his arm,pulling him closer.
@PerishAndDecay "No..I've already told you that I am not leaving until you change your mind" She grabbed him once again rather tightly.
@PerishAndDecay "Don't you think I've been blaming him?! You should know all about blaming people since you seem to be an expert at it!!"
@PerishAndDecay ~ I want to be someone's, I want to be able to love someone!"
@PerishAndDecay "Wouldn't you like to pretend?  As if someone did care about you for once...That's all I want besides everything else..~
@PerishAndDecay "Do I look happy?  He's not even mine to begin with!!  He's sadness not mine..."
@PerishAndDecay "Like, I said before I'm not leaving until you changed your mind...And he seems to be quite busy anyway.."
@PerishAndDecay "I'm not fucking leaving until you change your mind.." She was being as serious as she could be when she spoke to him.
@IncarnatedFury "Well,since you called me Baby,I guess I'll call you...Sweetie or Baby" She laughed as she slowly pulled away from his lips.
@PerishAndDecay ~ that away from me.."
@PerishAndDecay "I know...But,that doesn't mean I want to die..I've lived for a very long time and I'll be dammed if you're going to take~
@PerishAndDecay "Good,but I'm still going to make you change your mind" She grabbed his arm once again rather tightly
@IncarnatedFury "Did you just call me Baby? Wow...Now, that's new" She leaned over to him,kissing him softly.
@PerishAndDecay "Then do it...I mean you won't get far,though.. "
@PerishAndDecay "I don't know,kill me..Possibly try to beat me to Death, " She shrugged her shoulders
@IncarnatedFury "I'm kidding, Z" she gave him a small smile
@PerishAndDecay "So,you're gonna kill me as well?" She crossed her arms as she rose a brow.
@IncarnatedFury "Ive never really been someone's before..wait except for that one time..." She giggled and looked over at him
@PerishAndDecay "Just don't forget who has been nice to you...Even though I'm a sin I do care about you still"
@IncarnatedFury ~ him.
@IncarnatedFury "What's yours?...." She repeated as if she was confused at his word's, she quickly let go of his hand as she looked over at~
@IncarnatedFury ~ a meaningless sigh as they continued to walk.
@IncarnatedFury "Look, As long as I'm not interested there's nothing you should worry about" She looked down at their hands and let out ~
@PerishAndDecay "No,Death...wait!" She quickly followed after him,taking a hold of his arm to stop him from walking.
@IncarnatedFury "No, you won't... Zero,they were just staring nothing more..." She took a hold of his hand,intertwining their fingers.
@PerishAndDecay "Death...Just come with me and we can just talk about all of this,okay?"
@IncarnatedFury "Zero,what are you doing?" She followed him,grabbing his arm to pull him away from the other men as they stared at him.
@PerishAndDecay ~ that as well.."
@PerishAndDecay "Look,Just listen okay..You're perfect for this job and you're just turning a little soft that's all..I've been through ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ of them who waved and flashed a smile at her,but she figured he was being friendly so she waved back and flashed a smile.
@IncarnatedFury "They're just pigs.. Just ignore them okay? I've had plenty of run in's with men like that.." She rolled her eye's at one~
@PerishAndDecay ~ help him.
@PerishAndDecay "Let's just talk about this,alright?  Let me help you" She felt odd saying those words but, she felt like she needed to ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ shorts.
@IncarnatedFury ~ to her,she didn't know but she just kept walking. Watching men stare at her while she passed by due to her wearing short~
@IncarnatedFury "It does? Thank you.." She rose a brow when he heard his words. Was he really being serious or was he just being an ass~
@PerishAndDecay "Don't lose hope just because, of her and my brother.."  She slowly set her hand on his shoulder.
@PerishAndDecay "Well,it was her choice.. She's not a virtue anymore just another pathetic wannabe Sin..nothing more"
@PerishAndDecay "What's going on if I may ask?"
@IncarnatedFury ~ walking out of the hotel and outside.
@IncarnatedFury "Eh,I wouldn't mind that but,.let's get going and kill some bitches.. " She kissed him roughly before pulling away and~
@PerishAndDecay "Death,get your ass over here and drink with me"
"Death~ Come drink with me again!" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ when youre around me.."
@IncarnatedFury She smiled deviously "And you look good with those scratch marks all over your back..I can't keep my hands off of you~
@IncarnatedFury "/Maybe/...And I'm shocked that you were moaning so loudly" She wrapped her arms around his neck,giving him a playful smile
@IncarnatedFury ~ against him "And I'm not hard to please.."
@IncarnatedFury "Bitch, don't tell me to hurry up.." She laughed and walked over to him,sitting down onto his lap,slowly moving against ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ because, I'm pretty fucking bored.. " She got up and fixed her hair and makeup.
@IncarnatedFury She rolled her eye's in a playful way as she pushed him off of her.  "Now,I'm gonna go cause some trouble or something ~
@IncarnatedFury Once,they were finished. She slipped on her clothes and sat down on the edge of her bed,"That was amazing as usual.. "
"Please, put her in her fucking place..You'd be such a life saver "
@MorbidArtistry 
"Skuld, I'd honestly ignore the way she talks, she is kinda acting all bad ass right now..Since,she thinks that being a virtue is boring. "
"Charity,she's a mythological creature that is a woman who rules over the destiny of God's and men.."
@ChasteNotHaste "it's a female who rules the destiny of gods and men, a mythological creature aka a myth from the Greeks "
@ChasteNotHaste "I would look it up,I'd be afraid to ask as well"
@ChasteNotHaste "No one knows, just ask"
@IncarnatedFury "Yes,I do want it..." She muttered against his soft lips,before tugging gently on his lip ring as she kissed him.
@IncarnatedFury "Maybe I do,maybe I don't... " She placed her lips on his,kissing him roughly as she wrapped her legs around his waist
@IncarnatedFury "Zero...Why should I be yours ? What if I'm already someone else's?" She joked around as she giggled.
@Temperantia_ "Well, your sister Charity seems to be corrupted.. big time..No offence towards your family but,I hate them.."
@IncarnatedFury She kissed him back just as deep, she was still confused at why he was kissing her and pinning her hands against the wall.
@VirtueDiligence She pulled away only to kiss the tip of his nose "I really do like you,Diligence.. "
@Temperantia_ "Theyre suppose to be virtue's.. They can't sin or else they'll be punished right?"
@IncarnatedFury She hesitantly kissed her back,keeping her body covered the best she could with her arms. She was slightly confused in a way
@IncarnatedFury "Oh, Really?  Who said that I was yours?" She covered her body slightly with her arms when he ripped her towel off of her.
@IncarnatedFury ~ rolled her eye's and gently pushed him out of her way.
@IncarnatedFury "I'm not talking about him,Zero...Trust me I have /plenty/ of others that are interested to ride the Lex train " She ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ to go get the phone to see how damaged it was.
@IncarnatedFury "What the Fuck?! I was trying to call someone who is clearly interested in me" She crossed her arms and went to go ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ over to her bed where the phone was,picking it up.
@IncarnatedFury ~ in a way,she didn't know why though "Maybe,I should give that one guy at the club a call.." She mumbled as she walked~
@IncarnatedFury "Nothing, is wrong with me..Just don't fucking tell me what to do!" She pulled away from him once again,she was pretty mad~
@Temperantia_ "I know..My family fights a lot but, we get along since incest is very common in my family.. '
@IncarnatedFury "Don't tell me what to do,Z"She pulled away from him and wrapped a towel around her body, making her way out of the bathroom
@IncarnatedFury "Eh, I was trying to be romantic I guess" She laughed jokingly as she moved his hand away and stepped out of the shower.
@IncarnatedFury "Anything you want...I don't mind if you leave bruises or scratches.. It let's people know I'm yours.. " She smiled slightly
@IncarnatedFury She smiled slightly and bit onto her lower lip. Damn, he was utterly amazing to her "Well, I wouldn't mind,Z"
@DarkOfSpirit_ "What could I do,to change myself...At time's I think I'm in love but,I don't know..Those feelings are rare to sins."
@IncarnatedFury ~ we break this vessel in..?"
@IncarnatedFury She bit onto her bottom lip,when he touched her it sent chills down her spine and through out her body. "So,how about ~
@Temperantia_ ~ as she spoke.
@Temperantia_ "Wow, I'm shocked that you wouldn't have a relationship with any of them...Honestly " She kept all her attention on him~
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Well,I don't think I'll find someone to love..You see,no one wants someone who'll want them all to herself and no one else's
@IncarnatedFury ~ if she was joking.
@IncarnatedFury "Oh,really..." She handed him the soap with a small smirk upon her face "You can touch me if you'd like..." She laughed as~
@Temperantia_ "What's your relationship with each one of them If you don't mind me asking, James" she rose a brow as she looked up are him.
@Temperantia_ She laughed when she felt her cheek being poked by him"So,whats it like to be around your brothers and sisters?"
@DarkOfSpirit_ "No,I'm not falling in love,Loki..But,yes sins are able to feel those things but, it's very rare when they do especially love
@DarkOfSpirit_ "There are some virtue's.. that take interest in me ,that's why I dont avoid them all.."
@Temperantia_ "/Yes/ you're cheeks are like cute little pillows..If that doesn't sound weird at all..which I mean it probably does,right?"
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Well, I guess.. But,it seems the virtue's vessels are quite attractive as well.."
@Temperantia_ "Nah, Trust me.. You look totally better in them than I do" She giggled and poked in cheek in a playful way.
@IncarnatedFury She slowly pulled away and started to wash her own body off, acting as if he wasn't there.
@DarkOfSpirit_ "I think she's just jealous because, I'm more likeable than she is.."
@Temperantia_ "Well,thank you.."She took off his glasses and slowly put them back on his face "But,you look better in them than I do,James"
@IncarnatedFury "I can see you're enjoying this alot..." She giggled and kissed him roughly,slowly moving her body against his.
@DarkOfSpirit_ "I like how she thinks I'm jealous of her. Like bitch,if I was jealous of you wouldn't I be the one calling you names?"
@Temperantia_ ~ them on "How do I look?" She laughed as she posed.
@Temperantia_ "I'm glad you're not..I was afraid you'd be just like them..But,shockingly you're not.." She took off his glasses and put ~
@Temperantia_ "Sadly,I don't.. You know your family drives me crazy..But you don't.. " She leaned closer to him,flashing him a bright smile.
@Temperantia_ "Yeah,well I'm pretty pissed right at this moment so, yeah..Alcohol is like my best friend right at this moment in time"
@IncarnatedFury ~ moved the soap against his body,she slowly moved her hands lower down his body in the process.
@IncarnatedFury "Why should I?..How about I clean yours?.." She flashed him a devious smile as she took the soap from him,and slowly ~
@Temperantia_ "Definitely...It's better than having random guys try to dance with you" She laughed and took another shot.
"Finally, a virtue is making sense!!"
@Temperantia_ She tilted her head back to quickly take the shot, she set down the glass once it was empty.
@DarkOfSpirit_ She laughed and shook her head "Virtue's aren't suppose to insult others...But, as you can see. She's a wannabe sin.."
@Temperantia_ ~ I'd rather stay here and enjoy myself.."
@Temperantia_ The bartender set down the shots in front of them,as Alexis looked over at the dance floor then back at him "Hmm, but ~
@DarkOfSpirit_ ~ big and bad to I guess impress him.."
@DarkOfSpirit_ "My dearest friend Zero which is Anger..But, me and him were and kinda are fuckbuddies I guess? Anyway, she's just acting~
@Temperantia_ ~ a virtue such as yourself.. " She ordered a round of shots for each of them,flashing him a small smile.
@Temperantia_ "I mean we don't /have/ to dance,it's not like a must plus, the way you're suppose to dance here would be inappropriate for~
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Well..I think she just wants to impress the male sins..But,it's funny that only one shows any bit of intrest in her"
@DarkOfSpirit_ ~ with one of her brother's which is what SINS do not fucking virtue's.. "
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Well,Yeah she decided to act all bad ass and call me a slut..It's funny because, I for one have seen her actions aka incest~
@Temperantia_ "Well, I guess we shall be the two weirdos doing the Waltz in the club" She giggled and looked around at their surroundingsm
@Temperantia_ ~ they were inside the club.
@Temperantia_ "Of course,I'll dance but, will you?  I mean it would be weird if you didn't and I did,right? " She looked over at him once~
@DarkOfSpirit_ "My opposite, the virtue Charity..Apparently she's a badass now..Ugh"
@Temperantia_ ~ club she could find.
@Temperantia_ She smiled slightly when he pulled her closer towards him,she then nodded at his words and began to walk towards the nearest ~
"Bitch, please.. Look, how amazing I look unlike some people " 
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Well, you seem very challenging to corrupt plus, I have to save my energy for some corrupted virtue that called me a slut"
@DarkOfSpirit_ "No, just having a little fun with gifs. I see no reason to attempt to corrupt you,Loki" She giggled and shook her head.
@DarkOfSpirit_ "Possibly, plus they'd be punished, right?  I mean,it's cute that some are so easily corrupted " 
@LupineCourage It's amazing how some of the virtue's are acting like sins.. but, it didn't surprise me,though
@DarkOfSpirit_ "I find it oddly funny in a way that a virtue would sin...or even act like a sin"
@DarkOfSpirit_ Only like two or three are being good and the others are acting like a sin which they are clearly not.
@LupineCourage They're certainly not acting like virtue's but, only like two or three are...
"Yes,Chasity a sin did compliment you..shockingly.. "
"Honestly, I thought the virtue's were suppose to ya know be good and shit, but all I see is incest and other things that SINS do"
@Temperantia_ "Well,that's nothing new but, anyway.. Let's go do something!  Maybe, like go to the club or movie's? "
"Chasity is like the only virtue that's a girl, that is pure and innocent.. Which is a good thing for a virtue right? '
"Wow, you're totally hurting my feelings. It's funny how you're all talk but, no do...All you're trying to do is to get Zero to like you.."
"Oh,my..I'm so offended.. And "go slut it up somewhere else" Is pretty amusing coming from someone such as yourself. "
@Temperantia_ ~ She looked up at him,shrugging her shoulders.
@Temperantia_ "Well, It's pretty fun there.. We'd be able to actually get to be around each other without being judged by your family.. " ~
"Oh, God.. Is Charity still trying to act badass?"
"Everyone knows I'm the worst sin" 
@Temperantia_ "Aww, you can't kill anyone? " She let out a sad sigh as she looked down at the ground "Even if They're a bad person?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,tell me the rules.." She muttered against his lips once he had kissed her,she gladly kissed him back with passion.
@Temperantia_ ~ brother's and sister's to clean up afterwards? "
@Temperantia_ She slowly pulled away with a bright smile upon her face "Now, are you ready to cause some trouble for your meaningless ~
@Temperantia_ "Forget about them.. " She muttered against his lips as she continued to kiss him,adding a little passion as well.
@Temperantia_ ~ giggle quietly, she then cupped his face slowly, kissing his lips softly and gently.
@Temperantia_ "Well, that's because I like you... You're a fascinating virtue unlike your sisters, no offence.. " She couldn't help but, ~

@IncarnatedFury ~ to the bathroom, leaving the door opened as she slowly took all her clothes off.
@IncarnatedFury "/Well/ I mean you could jump in the shower with me " She slowly sat up and got off of the bed. She then made her way~
@Temperantia_ "Well, thank you.. I honestly never get compliments at all since, I have a shitty personality and I'm a sin.."
@Temperantia_ "I just poked you for fun..And your personality is attractive as well,Temperance.. " She leaned up to him,kissing his cheek.
@IncarnatedFury "You know you could've just woke me up and do this.." She flashed a big smile as she spoke, but she kept her eyes closed.
@VirtueDiligence "Yes, you are...." She laughed against his soft lips as she continued to kiss him softly
@SeventhSinPride "Maybe,because I have a shitty personality?  I don't know.. "
@Temperantia_ "Well,I never thought a virtue could be hot.." She joked around as she laughed and poked his side gently
@IncarnatedFury She did like what he was doing so she just remained silent as she still pretended to sleep.
@IncarnatedFury ~ to see what he'd still do if she was still asleep.
@IncarnatedFury She slowly opened her eye's as she looked down at him.But, quickly closed her eye's as if she was still asleep,she wanted~
@IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury "Well,trouble is what I look for...But,you know you love me getting into trouble, Z" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ his slowly.
@IncarnatedFury She didn't know he was touching her leg due to her still being asleep, she moved slightly causing her body to move against ~
@IncarnatedFury "Well,maybe if they'd leave me alone..." 
@IncarnatedFury Once she had fallen alseep she wrapped on of her legs around him unknowingly as she continued to sleep peacefully.
@IncarnatedFury "Because, I was sadly getting my ass kicked.. 
@IncarnatedFury ~ "Goodnight, My deadly prince" She whispered before, closing her eye's attempting to go to sleep.
@IncarnatedFury "Uh,Thank you I guess.." She couldn't help but laugh at his word's, she rolled him over so she could kiss him softly ~
@IncarnatedFury "Bitch,try jumping out of a moving RV" 
@IncarnatedFury She slowly wrapped her arms around him,cuddling close to him. She didn't care if he would push her away when she did.
@IncarnatedFury ~ the huge bruise upon her face from the punch,she then laid down onto her bed. She then closed her eye's.
@IncarnatedFury ~ her blood covered clothes and took a shower, wincing in pain whenever she would touch the side of her face due to ~
@IncarnatedFury She followed him back all the way to her house,once they arrived. She opened the door and stepped inside,she took off~
@IncarnatedFury ~ against his.
@IncarnatedFury "Let's just go back to my place,Okay?  We can just get some rest... " She gave him a small smile as she rested her head ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ me,Z..."
@IncarnatedFury ~ let out a sigh when he wouldn't look at her. She leaned up pecking his lips softly and gently "Thank you for protecting ~
@IncarnatedFury She tried to do anything she could with her powers but, his hands would still be sore no matter what she had done. She~
@IncarnatedFury She slowly walked over to him,grabbing his hands carefully so she wouldn't hurt his blood covered hands "Let me help you.."
@IncarnatedFury "Stop! J-just calm down!" She screamed and backed away from him and against the bathroom wall
@IncarnatedFury ~ she admitted as she backed away from him knowing he was filled with rage.
@IncarnatedFury She moved away from him quickly as she nodded slowly "Yeah, I'm Fine...Trust me. I've gotten done worse done before..."~
@IncarnatedFury ~ her when he had punched her.
@IncarnatedFury ~ her body, she jumped down off of the man and went into the bathroom to look at the now forming dark bruises the.man left~
@IncarnatedFury She quickly stood back up,jumping onto the man's back. Stabbing him in the top of his head, blood splattering all over ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ again, but he picked her up by her shirt,quickly punching her and throwing her right back onto the ground.
@IncarnatedFury ~ in her way until she ran into a man whom she had stabbed. He quickly threw her onto the ground as she tried to stab him~
@IncarnatedFury ~ back,my sexy prince.." She laughed at her own words as she made her way through the crowd stabbing anyone that was~
@IncarnatedFury She let her hands trail down his body and to his back pocket taking out the knife,she slowly got off of him "I'll be right~
@IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury "Do you have your knife with you..." She moved herself onto his lap,setting each of her legs on his side
"I love how Charity is acting all bad ass, yet she's just a simple little virtue "
@IncarnatedFury ~ his ear after she spoke.
@IncarnatedFury "That bitch who had her hands all over you while you were dancing..Who do you want to kill,Z" She let a small moan by ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ she whispered in his ear as she moved his hand onto her upper thigh.
@IncarnatedFury "Mmm.. I'd really like that but, I want to kill someone first and get covered in blood while we Fuck..How does that sound~
@IncarnatedFury ~ started to laugh as she whispered in his ear "I want you so bad..Z"
@IncarnatedFury When he spoke by her ear, it oddly sent chills down her spine but, she liked it."Yeah..." Once she saw colors, she ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ part of his jeans, she changed her mind about the pills and took it back. Quickly taking it.
@IncarnatedFury "I don't want to take anymore of these.." She handed it back to him, and took a shot, her hand brushing past the front ~
@IncarnatedFury She slowly and hesitantly kissed him back,moving his hand off of her hip. She looked over at him,raising a brow at his smile
@IncarnatedFury ~ or jealous?  She just followed him,watching the other people around them.
@IncarnatedFury "What the hell?.. " She was confused wasn't he just dancing on a random girl so, what was the difference. Was he mad~
@PerishAndDecay "Well,Let's go get something to drink.." She led him over to the bar, ordering them a round of shots.
@PerishAndDecay "Wanna get a drink or something, Death?"
@IncarnatedFury 
"Ugh, why is everyone so obsessed over Charity?  She's fucking boring as Fuck.. "
@IncarnatedFury ~ near her,grabbing his hands and moving his hands up and down her body.
@IncarnatedFury Once,she saw him dancing with another girl. She rolled her eye's and decided to move against a random guy who was ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ and a mixed Drink,when she was walking back a couple of guys pulled her back on the dance floor, grinding against her.
@IncarnatedFury Alexis started to feel weird as she made her way through the crowd and over to the bar,ordering him a.bottle of whiskey ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ want me to get you anything?"
@IncarnatedFury She took it soon after he did,she continued to grind her body against his before stopping "Hey,I'm heading over to the bar~
@PerishAndDecay "You're doing wonderful, just don't step on my feet.." She laughed and shook her head slowly.
@IncarnatedFury 
@Temperantia_ "You're welcome..." She gave him a small smile as she looked at him.
@IncarnatedFury ~ killing anyone.
@IncarnatedFury She laughed and pulled him onto the dance floor,slowly moving her body against his. Deciding to have a little fun before~
@IncarnatedFury 
@VirtueDiligence "You're /so/ cute.." She giggled and kept her lips on his as she kissed him.
@IncarnatedFury ~ at the men,and women around her.
@IncarnatedFury She looked around as they walked down the street, once they arrived at the bar. She stepped inside taking a look around~
@IncarnatedFury ~ smiled and kissed him roughly rather than softly.
@IncarnatedFury "Who shall we torture.. It has to be someone who'll put up a challenge so,maybe go to like a bar or something?" She ~
@PerishAndDecay "Well,you're a pretty good dancer for a beginner " She turned around so, she could face him. Wrapping her arms around him.
@Temperantia_ She rose a brow at his actions,slightly confused at why he was being polite towards her "My,you're such a gentleman.. "
@IncarnatedFury "Mmm... Zero, I like the sound of that.." She slowly got off of him,she then picked up her shirt and slipped it on
@IncarnatedFury She let out a quiet moan against his lips as her tongue moved against his,her hands roaming around his body slowly.
@PerishAndDecay "See? I told you,you could dance...Is this your first time dancing by the way?'"
@Temperantia_ "It's a pleasure to meet you,James" She laughed and extended her hand as if they had just met.
@PerishAndDecay ~ were doing.
@PerishAndDecay "Nothing honestly, just move your body against mine" She kept moving her hips against his just like the others around them ~
@Temperantia_ "Yay! I'm pretty good at coming up with names for people" She smiled brightly as if she was proud of herself.
@PerishAndDecay ~ on her hips as she began to sway her hips to the music.
@PerishAndDecay She led him onto the dance floor where most of the people were at the time since music was playing,she placed his hands~
FUCKING THIS
FUCKING /THIS/ 
@PerishAndDecay ~ and extremely loud music playing.
@PerishAndDecay "Oh, shut up and take a compliment for once.." She laughed and led him inside the club where the was loads of people~
@Temperantia_ "Hmm.. How either...hmm..Chris or James? I mean that would be a good name for a virtue I guess"
@IncarnatedFury ~ rather teasingly, she honestly loved to tease him.
@IncarnatedFury She nipped at his neck gently before making his way back to his lips. Slowly sucking on his lip ring before pulling away~
@PerishAndDecay "Yay,you're truly fucking awesome!" She took a hold of his hand once again, leading him to the nearest club she could find.
@IncarnatedFury ~ down onto his neck.
@IncarnatedFury "That's fucking hot.." She pushed him off of her and onto the ground, she climbed on top of him. Her soft lips trailing ~
@Temperantia_ "Well, I shall give you a name then if that's okay with you?" She rose a brow,still wondering why he was holding her so close.
@PerishAndDecay "Oh come on..I bet you can dance..Will you at least try for me? Pretty please?" She smiled and giggled quietly.
@IncarnatedFury 
@VXeirix "Well,Uh what do I look like to you? Hmm?" She crossed her arms,waiting for an answer from the stranger.
@CalmestVirtue "Eh, not really but, thank you.."
@PerishAndDecay "Perfect! Do you know how to dance and do you drink liquor by any chance?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,why doesn't your vessel have a name,Temperance?"
@IncarnatedFury ~ down onto her lower lip.
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh,is this /all/ you think about,sweetie?" She couldn't help but, laugh when he pushed her against the wall. She bit ~
@PerishAndDecay "Yeah,hmmm.. We should go to a club or something?  I mean can we?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,I'm the sin Greed but, my vessel's name is Alexis.. What's yours?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,we should cause some trouble it'll give your brothers and sisters something to do,right?"
@IncarnatedFury "Oh,really?  Is that so?" She started to slowly slid on her shorts as a way of teasing him as she gave him a playful wink
@VirtueDiligence "Aww, thank you.." She mumbled as she rolled over on top of him,not breaking their passionate kiss.
@CalmestVirtue "She's pretty that's why,I guess?"
@Temperantia_ "We cause lots and lots of trouble.. What do you virtue's like to do?" She rose a brow when he pulled her close to him.
@VirtueDiligence "Shhh.. Swearing is fun" She muttered against his lips as she continued to kiss him adding more passion into the kiss.
@PerishAndDecay "Well,what now,Death?  I mean is there anything you'd like to do?"
@VirtueDiligence "Your laugh is too fucking cute,sweetie" She kept on until she placed her lips on his,kissing him.passionately.
@Temperantia_ "Well,then I guess I shall stay here with you then.." She moved back over to him,laying her head on his shoulder.
@PerishAndDecay "Well,without humans.. I wouldn't exist so,I'm kinda glad God made them even if They're for his entertainment. "
@Temperantia_ "And whys that? I mean why do you want me to stay?" She rose a brow as she tilted her head slightly.
@Temperantia_ ~ with a deadly sin such as myself."
@Temperantia_ She simply shrugged her shoulders as she moved away from him slowly "So,Let me know if you want any other similar contacts ~
@Temperantia_ ~ his neck.
@Temperantia_ "I told you so...Well,did you enjoy my simple little kiss?" She flashed him a playful smile as she wrapped her arms around ~
@PerishAndDecay "Hmmm.. So,Let's see...Can you feel hatred or sadness at all by any chance, Death?"
@CalmestVirtue "I'm shocked usually men are attracted to my sister..."
@Temperantia_ She slowly pulled away,making a small space between their lips as she looked at him"See? It's not such a big deal or anything"
@PerishAndDecay ~ something for once.
@PerishAndDecay "Uh,I guess I did? Did you feel anything at all?" The simple kiss was meaningless to her but, she wanted to help him feel~
@VirtueDiligence "Yes,Really... " She started to plant kisses all over his face as she giggled.
@Temperantia_ "Okay" She leaned close to him,pressing her soft lips against his,kissing him softly yet passionately
@PerishAndDecay "Well,Maybe you could feel something with this?" She leaned up, kissing him softly and gently before pulling away slowly.
@Temperantia_ "Yeah...They did trust me..So,do you wanna kiss a deadly sin or not"
@Temperantia_ "Well,what if that sin was me? And, your brother and sister kissed.. So,that's a bigger sin then kissing me only once,right?"
@VirtueDiligence "Yup! And only you can call me cute and all"She smiled at his words as she slowly ran her fingers through his hair.
@Temperantia_ "Possibly but, it's just one /tiny/ little sin..I mean I bet you'd like it.."
@PerishAndDecay ~ than her vessel was,slowly raising a curious brow.
@PerishAndDecay "I bet you can..you just have never tried to feel those emotions before,have you?" She looked up at him since he was taller~
@Temperantia_ "Well~ Have you ever kissed a sin before?"
@SeventhSinPride "Well,I guess the world has gone crazy then"
@Temperantia_ "Well,What kind of contact are you talking about?" 
@VirtueDiligence "God,your dorkiness returns" She laughed and kissed the tip of his nose
@SeventhSinPride "Psh, no one wants to get in bed with me,Pride"
@PerishAndDecay "Didn't you feel pain? I mean that would have felt horrible.. "
@FightMeIRL_ @DesireAndNeed "Is that damn a good thing or bad thing?..."
@Temperantia_ "Hmmm, how about an awesome personality that goes with it?"
@Temperantia_ "Well,what about me then?" 
"Who wouldn't find me and my dear sister @DesireAndNeed sexy?" 
@VirtueDiligence "/No/,I just wanna cuddle up close to you..Is that a problem cause I can move away if you'd want me to"
@PerishAndDecay "Uh,You're on fire though!  Can't you feel it?!" Once the flames went away she let out a sigh of relief.
@CalmestVirtue "Well,what about me?" 
@Temperantia_ "Are you Sure? I mean I could probably currupt you and so could my sister,Lust' 
@VirtueDiligence Once she had on her clothes, she laid back down beside him. She wrapped her arms around him,pulling him close.
@CalmestVirtue "You just might though.. I mean have you seen my sister Lust?"
@Temperantia_ "True..I mean we could also currupt y'all.. I mean thats what Anger is trying to do.."
@PerishAndDecay "You're burning!" She took his jacket, attempting to fan the flames out quickly
@CalmestVirtue "Hell if I know but, still.. You can't sin if you're a virtue,love"
@Temperantia_ "So? And? I mean it's pretty fun to us and maybe you innocent little virtue's could leave? That would make things easier"
@PerishAndDecay Her green eye's widen at the sight of the flames,she quickly stood up and walked over to him.
@VirtueDiligence "You're a virtue that means you're obviously better than I" She gently pushed him off of her so she could get dressed.
@PerishAndDecay She waited for him patiently to come back outside,she sat down beside his jacket taking a look around at her surroundings.
@CalmestVirtue "Well, is kissing each other playful?  They must not be as innocent as they should be"
"Plus, incest is a sin for the virtue's.. " 
@PerishAndDecay ~ house on fire.
@PerishAndDecay "Okay" She took the matches out of her cleavage and took the lighter fluid box out of her pocket, happily setting the ~
@CalmestVirtue "Almost all of them are, I mean aren't yall suppose to be pure and innocent? "
@PerishAndDecay "Yup, you are correct my dear friend and you'll just collect their souls right?"
"Why are all the virtue's talking about breasts?" 
@PerishAndDecay "Well,how about I help you! I can usually make things pretty fun" She gave him a playful smile as she stopped walking.
@ArchMercy She was utterly confused but simply shrugged and just stood there. Looking around
@ArchMercy "Oh,Okay?  That's nice I guess?"
@Temperantia_ "Of course,we're around..We'll always be around, sweetie "
@ArchMercy "Ugh,what's the problem now? "
@CalmestVirtue "Well,who will then?"
@PerishAndDecay "Oh,Hush.. "She looked over at him as they walked down the side walk "So,whats it like being Death and all"
@ArchMercy "What? Is there a problem? "
@CalmestVirtue "Well, I guess Lust will probably have you then" 

@PerishAndDecay "Perfect!  Let's go!" She took a hold of his hand, leading him down the side walk.
@CalmestVirtue "/maybe./ he's quite the charmer "
@PerishAndDecay "We could burn down a house? I usually do that alot " 
@SeventhSinPride "How is having a great ass important? "
@SeventhSinPride "Well, I do have other thing's besides lips but, thank you... I guess?" 
@PerishAndDecay "You're welcome! Now, what shall we do?" She leaned back slightly as she rose a curious brow.
@SeventhSinPride "Well,thank you my dearest brother "
@SeventhSinPride "Oh, okayy. Well, what do you think of my new vessel? " 
@PerishAndDecay She couldn't help but, continue to laugh "Aww, see. You look wonderful with a smile upon your face!"
"I have a feeling Pride is going to try to Fuck all the virtue's.. "
@PerishAndDecay "Do I see a faint smile upon your face,Death? " She laughed as she leaned closer to him to get a better look.
@PerishAndDecay "Well, I mean it sounds kinda fun,don't you think? " She flashed him a playful smile as she looked at him.
@VirtueDiligence "/No/ you're the best, Diligence " She slowly ran her small fingers through his hair as she kissed his forehead.
@IncarnatedFury ~ him into the changing room with her, slowly taking her blood covered clothes off.
@IncarnatedFury ~ anyone saw her covered in blood or what store they went into. Once she found short shorts and a cute shirt, she drug ~
@IncarnatedFury "Anyone is Fine,Zero" She gave him a small smile as she pulled him into the nearest clothing store, not caring if~
@PerishAndDecay "Of course I'm better than my siblings, I mean come on have you seen me?" 
@VirtueDiligence "Aww, sweetie.. No you're the best" She kissed him back and flashed him a bright smile.
@PerishAndDecay "Well, I'm bored and I've done everything I've wanted to do so, now I'm going to help you"
@VXeirix "Is That so? I mean I look like a human so, what else could I be?" Greed laughed nervously as she looked at him.
@VirtueDiligence "Baby, stop!" She continued to laugh as he kissed her all over.
@IncarnatedFury Nah bitch you wish 
@ArchMercy "And whys that?" 
@ArchMercy 
@ArchMercy "Is that so?"
@ArchMercy "Aww, thank you.once again" 
@ArchMercy "/No/ but, I mean I can " 
@ArchMercy "Aww, thank you!" 
@PerishAndDecay "Well,I bet I could make you smile!" 
@PerishAndDecay "Well,do you think about them and smile? You don't always have to be near them."
@PerishAndDecay "You..Just do. I mean you feel it when you're with someone who makes you smile" 
@PerishAndDecay "Would you care if I help you feel..happiness? " 
@ArchMercy "Really?  I mean..This vessel isn't anything special. " 
@PerishAndDecay "Have you gave the feeling happiness a try?" 
@PerishAndDecay "Well,it may not end badly as much as you think it would " 
@PerishAndDecay "Well,Emotions such as happiness is hard to find for a sin" 
@ArchMercy "Oh,okay I was making Sure it wasn't because of my new vessel" 
@ArchMercy "Why are you blushing? " She rose a brow as she looked at him.
@VXeirix "Well,you don't look very familiar to me..." Greed was slightly confused and yet curious as to how he knew her.
@IncarnatedFury "Oh,really?  I've done worse,love. You should already know that" 
@VXeirix Greed looked over at the man,slowly raising a brow "I do?"
@VXeirix ~ past the stranger that was leaning against the wall.
@VXeirix Greed was walking around in her new vessel she had,seeing what it could take with going to parties, clubs and such. She walked~
@IncarnatedFury Well, I do set houses on fire... 
@IncarnatedFury Close? I'm /way/ sexier than you sweetie 
@IncarnatedFury Bitch please..I'm way hotter 
"Thanks to Zero, I have a new vessel..but,I think he likes it' 
@ArchMercy "You're welcome!" She flashed him a small smile.
@IncarnatedFury "Ewww... I thought Batman would be cuter.." 
@IncarnatedFury ~ at their surroundings.
@IncarnatedFury "But,we're covered in blood,I don't think that anyone would let us in their stores..." She followed him,looking around ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ She walked over towards his motorcycle.
@IncarnatedFury "We need to find something new to wear since we're already covered in blood..And you kinda ripped my dress a little~
@IncarnatedFury ~ something fun..I wanna go kill someone with you"
@IncarnatedFury "You're lucky I like you.." She smiled and kissed him rather roughly than softly like she usually did. "We should go do~
@IncarnatedFury "I can see that..." She laughed and shook her head "God..You left more bruises on me,Zero. So,what now?"
@IncarnatedFury ~ utterly amazing as always.."
@IncarnatedFury ~Time Skip~ Once, they were finished she slid back on her clothes, she looked over at him giving him a smile "That was~
@IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury ~ roaming his body.
@IncarnatedFury She nodded slowly as she kissed him back just as rough,tugging on his lower lip gently yet rough in a way. Her hands ~
@ArchMercy "Thanks, I like your name as well "
@IncarnatedFury "You drive me crazy as well..." She whispered softly as she moved away from him once again, attempting to tease him still.
@IncarnatedFury ~ him even more rough and excited in a way.
@IncarnatedFury "Z-Zero... " She bit down on her lower lip as she moved away from him slightly only to tease him,which she knew would make~
@IncarnatedFury She smiled against his lips as her hands went behind her back to unzip her dress,her lips never parting from his soft ones.
"I find Death oddly attractive. Is that bad?"
@IncarnatedFury She kept her lips on his as she wrapped her legs around his waist as she tugged on his hair harder.
"Eh, so what? I mean I have to since you're a virtue right?"
"Oh,God.. Why would I be a hater?  I'm just saying the truth "
"Ugh,Charity is just /so/ boring and generous.. Ew"
"Who's the better dancer,now?" @IncarnatedFury 
@IncarnatedFury ~ touched against his,blood smeared all over his clothes and his body. She knew he didn't care about the blood at all.
@IncarnatedFury She kissed him back just as passionate, one of her hands gripping onto his hair,gently tugging on her. When her body ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ him back his knife "Here...Sorry I just felt like having my own fun.."
@IncarnatedFury ~ blood spattering all over her body and dress. Flashing a devious smirk at Zero before walking back over to him. Handing ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ fight each other, she took the knife out of Zero's pocket and skipped over to each and every one,slicing their throats ~
@IncarnatedFury She watched with utter amazement, she pulled Zero close to her kissing him roughly before pulling away to watch the men~
@VirtueDiligence "Sweetie,that tickles stop!" She continued to laugh and move around so he would stop.
@IncarnatedFury ~ but,don't you think we should be leaving now,since the sirens are getting closer?"
@IncarnatedFury She couldn't help but, smile at his words. She couldn't help but, wonder why was he being so nice to her still? "Thank you~
@IncarnatedFury ~ and just wanted to get away from the store as soon as possible.
@IncarnatedFury "But,Zero They're getting closer.. Just give me that one with the emerald in the middle,Okay?" She was in a rush~
@ArchMercy "You can call me,Alexis sweetie not Greed all the time" She laughed and shook her head slowly.
@IncarnatedFury ~ looked back at Zero "What are we going to do...?"
@IncarnatedFury She looked over at the store's door,once she head sirens. Her guess was the police finally catching up to them,she quickly ~
@IncarnatedFury "But,thank you anyway.. " She leaned over to him,kissing his cheek softly as she leaned back down to look at the counter.
@FaithInLaws_ "Well, I want money or something wonderful in return.. it's up to you,what you want to give me"
@IncarnatedFury ~ to show me that I'm not just that..." She gave him a small smile.
@IncarnatedFury "Not just a fuckbuddy?.. " She took her eye's off of the counter and over to him "You don't have to get me anything ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ emerald in the middle but, she didn't say anything about it just kept looking.
@IncarnatedFury "Zero,you don't have to..at all" She looked over at the counters,her eye's traveled to a diamond necklace with a green~
@IncarnatedFury "Oh...Alright" Alexis took off the helmet and handed to him,once she got off of the motorcycle.
@VirtueDiligence "Hmmm, yeah it is" She laughed and shook her head.
@IncarnatedFury ~ where even there.
@IncarnatedFury She rose a brow as they stopped at a jewelry store,but she didn't say anything even though she was confused at why they ~
"/Fine/ only if I get something in return if I don't,Justice"
@VirtueDiligence "So,my dearest Diligence. What would you like to do today? "
"Oh,it's Justice. I haven't seen you around in awhile "
"Will someone just please kill these virtue's vessel's well,except Diligence of course"
"Ugh,these virtue's are everywhere! "
@IncarnatedFury "I don't know...Surprise me,I guess" She shrugged her shoulder's as she put the helmet on and got on the motorcycle.
@ArchMercy "How have you been,lately?"
@ArchMercy "Hey~" Alexis flashed a bright smile at him and waved slightly
@IncarnatedFury ~ she didn't know at all,but she wanted to.
@IncarnatedFury She nodded slowly at his words, still shocked to even speak. What was he doing?  Was he just trying to be nice to her?~
@IncarnatedFury ~ with as much passion she could give him.
@IncarnatedFury She was not expecting him to kiss her, but before she could even say anything. She kissed him back just as soft but, filled~
@IncarnatedFury She didn't even bother looking back even though she wanted to,she just kept walking pushing people out of her way in process
@IncarnatedFury ~ away from him.
@IncarnatedFury "Well...I guess,I'll see you around then.." She let out a sigh and looked down at the ground as she began to walk~
@IncarnatedFury ~ the verge of just walking away from it all but, she didn't. She couldn't, she had to know
@IncarnatedFury "You what..." She crossed her arms as she waited for him to speak,rather scared at what he would say to her. She was on~
@IncarnatedFury ~ thought he would be angry at her words and lash out on her.
@IncarnatedFury "Y-Youre not? Then what are you feeling, Zero.." She was taken back at his words so she stayed put where she was,she ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ looked down at her shoe's then back at him.
@IncarnatedFury "Because, I want to be something else with someone.. not just be a fuckbuddy that you need only when you're bored" She~
@IncarnatedFury ~ and managed to move him out of the way,as she walked out of the bathroom.
@IncarnatedFury "It does..But, you can't love me like you should.. Ya know?  We can't be fuckbuddies for all entirety?" She looked down ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ to move him out of the way.
@IncarnatedFury "Because, it's meaningless!  Don't you want something that has feelings such as passion?" She let out a sigh as she tried~
@IncarnatedFury "Well,you kinda are my bitch, sweetie" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ tried to leave the bathroom.
@IncarnatedFury "To try to calm you down..Don't get me wrong..I like this but,this is wrong" She pushed him off of her completely as she~
@IncarnatedFury "Z-Zero...Stop.." She  let out a sigh as she looked at him.
My #MCM @IncarnatedFury because, he's my bitch 
@IncarnatedFury || his*
@IncarnatedFury "Y-yes I do mean it.." She let out an unintentional sound as she moved her hand away from her dress.
@IncarnatedFury "Zero...Just stop.." When his hip touched against hers, she felt her cheeks heat up.
@IncarnatedFury Yeah...Sure.. 
@IncarnatedFury "No,Zero...You don't, now let me go.." She looked into his eye's,attempting to push him away once again.
@IncarnatedFury "I..I can't let you do this..You're just having mixed emotions about it.." She tried to push him away gently.
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,but not willingly 
@IncarnatedFury She slowly pulled away,she didn't want to but, she knew she had to. It was the right thing to do "Zero..."
@IncarnatedFury "Soooo? ' 
@IncarnatedFury ~ laugh.
@IncarnatedFury "Zero! Put me down!" She didn't mind if blood got on her, she was too busy laughing. She couldn't help herself but to ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ that was the only way he would stop kissing her. She knew he didn't like her that way and that wouldn't change.
@IncarnatedFury She kept her lips on his as she rested her arms around his neck,before taking the feeling greed away from him since,~
@IncarnatedFury Eh,mayyybbee and you know you want this 
@IncarnatedFury "I know so.' 
@VirtueDiligence "/Oh/ nothing, sweetie" She looked at him,giving him a bright smile.
@VirtueDiligence "Mhm, /Sure/ you do.." She continued to laugh and shook her head slowly.
@IncarnatedFury "I look better.. "<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@VirtueDiligence "You better,that's all I have to say..." She giggled and kissed his lips softly
@SeventhSinPride "You're not the boss of me so technically speaking that means you're not the boss of /everything/ Pride "
"I'd make a sexy Eve " 
@VirtueDiligence "You better feel the Same as well,Diligence "
"Because, Fuck yeah" 
"Charity don't be a miss priss. Sins are far better than simple virtues, I mean have you seen our vessel's? ' 
#SeductiveSunday 
@IncarnatedFury ~ away slowly to look at him.
@IncarnatedFury "Here.. let me help you" She kissed him with passion only to fill his heart with Greed rather than anger,she then pulled ~
@VirtueDiligence "I love you,you know that right?"
"Oh hell no..Charity is here.. "
@IncarnatedFury ~ in attempts to still calm him down.
@IncarnatedFury "Fight it! I know you can! Just think about how much fun we were having today before all of this!" She spoke quietly ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ even for her,he wouldn't
@IncarnatedFury "Z-Zero, you stopped him,Okay?!" She wrapped her arms around him,attempting to calm him down. But,she knew he wouldn't not~
@IncarnatedFury Alexis moved in front of him,taking the knife out of his hand. She then threw it on the ground "Zero, look at me! Calm down!
@IncarnatedFury "P-Please, stop! I'll leave her alone I swear! " The boy pleaded as Alexis grabbed Zero's arm trying to pull him back
@SeventhSinPride "/No/ I don't think so,Pride!  You can't cook so, you're definitely not the boss in that category! '
@VirtueDiligence "But,you're /my/ dork,right?" She kissed him gently as she giggled  against his lips
@IncarnatedFury ~ speak as she heard the man's words.
@IncarnatedFury "She wasn't complaining!  Plus,I don't see her with a man or a ring around her finger" Alexis was still too shocked to ~
@IncarnatedFury ~ too shocked to even say a word so, she was rather speechless as well.
@IncarnatedFury The man quickly started to speak "N-Nothing, we were just having a little fun calm down!" Alexis just remained shocked~
@IncarnatedFury ~ her and touching her highly inappropriately,she kept pushing him away until the man pushed her hard against the wall.
@IncarnatedFury While she was over at the water fountain, a man about their vessels age started to some what harass Alexis,by hitting on~
@ArchMercy "Well,sometimes.. not all the time"
@ArchMercy "And why would you like me? Hmm? "
@ArchMercy "Psh,you're starting to like me? Haha that's a nice joke " 
@ArchMercy "Yes but, I give men choices unlike my sister"
@ArchMercy "You don't have to,if you don't want to."
@ArchMercy "Yeah,but it all depends.. "
@ArchMercy "You Sure? Sweetie, I'm nothing like Lust " 
@ArchMercy "I promise I don't bite" 
@ArchMercy "So,you wouldn't wanna have a little fun with a deadly sin?" 
@ArchMercy "/Maybe/" 
@ArchMercy Arousing? 
@ArchMercy Uh,why?
@ArchMercy Totally....
@VirtueDiligence She laughed and shook her head "God,you're such a dork!"
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,/totally/" She yelled as she made her way to the nearest water fountain
@ArchMercy Nah, I'm good. 
@VirtueDiligence "You just love kissing me don't you?"
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah.. Okay, Sure... I'll be right back..I'm gonna get me some water" She backed away from him
@ArchMercy Because, I can..

@IncarnatedFury She leaned close to him, poking the side of his cheek "Are you turning soft because of me? Hmm? "
@IncarnatedFury "Because, you're Anger..I never thought you could be nice.. especially to me"
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,of course but, I mean I wouldn't have expected you'd get me something, Zero"
"I look more bad ass than Zero in this" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ arms casually as she looked at him with a confused facial expression.
@IncarnatedFury "You were going to get me something?  But Why?" She was utterly confused, God guys were so confusing.  She crossed her~
@IncarnatedFury ~ looking down at the tile floor of the building, before looking back up at him.
@IncarnatedFury "All of these stores look retarded, I mean.. I thought this would be fun but it's not at all.." She let out a sad sigh~
@IncarnatedFury "Okay, I will" Once they were away from most of the people in the mall,she stopped walking completely to look around.
@VirtueDiligence "That's because you haven't seen my bad side. I don't think you ever will either. " She gladly kissed him back
@IncarnatedFury She followed him,watching the people around then as they went.
@SeventhSinPride "/No/ Pride..I'm the boss since /I'm / a way better cook than you are!" She continued to laugh as she shook her head
@VirtueDiligence She rolled her eye's playfully as she shook her head "I honestly don't see Why you like me so, much, Diligence "
@VirtueDiligence "You Sure do like to kiss me,don't you?" She laughed and kissed him back
@SeventhSinPride ~ expression, shaking her head slowly
@SeventhSinPride "I'm Sure I am a /way/ better cook than you Pride,matter a fact I think /im / the boss" She laughed at his facial ~
@IncarnatedFury "Anywhere in this place that has barely any people" She looked over at him when he put his arm around her.
@VirtueDiligence She giggled and kissed him back.
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah, a little.. there's just a shit ton of people.. " She gave him a weak smile as she moved closer to him
@VirtueDiligence "Of course I can show you,baby...I'll show you everything, Okay?" She gave him a bright smile
@SeventhSinPride "Yeah,you're /so/ the boss,Pride...A boss that can't cook for shit" She laughed and shook her head
@VirtueDiligence "There's a lot to still learn,Diligence.. A lot..trust me "
@VirtueDiligence "I would, if you want me to."
@IncarnatedFury After that she took s mintue to look around before slowly walking back to him
@VirtueDiligence "Don't be embarrassed " She kissed both sides of his cheeks when he blushed
@VirtueDiligence "Yes, of course it's allowed, Diligence " She continued to laugh
@VirtueDiligence She laughed and shook her head "You don't feel any different, Diligence unless you go harder"
@IncarnatedFury Once,she got there she bent down taking a sip of water
@IncarnatedFury ~ and through the people and to the water fountain
@IncarnatedFury "Me either.. I'll be right back,I'm gonna go get me something to drink at the water fountain "She moved away from him~
@VirtueDiligence "You're welcome.. how does it feel not to be a virgin anymore hmm?"
@GardenOfSin What?
@VirtueDiligence "Yes,honestly you're doing great " She flashed him a bright smile
@VirtueDiligence She smiled brightly as she kissed him back,blushing at his words
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,there's so many people..." She stood close by him as they walked inside
@IncarnatedFury Once they arrived, she took off the helmet and handed it to him.
@VirtueDiligence "I like you...a lot like a lot" She gave him a small smile
@VirtueDiligence "Diligence... " She slowly pulled her lips away from his neck to look at him
@IncarnatedFury She got on and put on the helmet he gave her,she slowly wrapped her arms around him to stay on
@VirtueDiligence As she kissed his neck,she left dark marks in the process and love bites as well
@PerishAndDecay "Like what?  There's nothing to do today and I'm rather bored..."
@PerishAndDecay "Yeah right..Why don't you just go Fuck yourself or find some girl willing to"
@VirtueDiligence She tightened her grip on his hair,pulling it so he could expose his neck,she leaned in kissing his neck softly
@PerishAndDecay "Nope, because you need us sins for you pathetic little kills and don't touch me asshole,Okay?"
@PerishAndDecay "Psh... You couldn't killed me if you tried,Death" she laughed and raised her middle finger at him
@PerishAndDecay "Well,aren't you just a gentleman.. " She crossed her arms and rolled her eyes
@VirtueDiligence She bit her lower lip as he kept going,she thought he finally let his feelings and body guide him
@PerishAndDecay "First of all, ew second of all you can go Fuck yourself since I see no mortal wanting to or willing to "

@VirtueDiligence "You don't have to be gentle with me,Diligence unless you want to be..you're in charge not me"
@VirtueDiligence "So,uh you know what to do next right?" She rose a brow,hoping he did so she wouldn't have to guide him through that part
@VirtueDiligence She gladly kissed him back,she then took off the remaining article's of clothing she had on
@VirtueDiligence "It's Okay, if you don't want to rush into things,Diligence.. we don't have to do this now?" She gave him a kind smile

@GhostFaceKiIIer She flashed a bright big smile "My,My,My...I was right..."
@Crownedsaviour "Wow,it's pretty Cool by the looks of it!" Alexis flashed him a bright smile as she stepped inside taking a look around
@VirtueDiligence She smiled into the kiss, gripping onto his hair as she did

@VirtueDiligence She loved the fact that he did,she moved her hands behind her back,unhooking her bra as she kept her lips on his
@GhostFaceKiIIer She walked inside, standing still as she tried to look around
@IncarnatedFury "Because, it's gonna be annoying for you to take care of me for a while don't you think?"
@VirtueDiligence She wrapped her legs around his waist as she continued to kiss him,letting her tongue slip into his mouth
@IncarnatedFury "Ewww Mine is so much better " 
@VirtueDiligence She laid Back on her bed,slowly pulling him on top of her as they kissed
@PatiorAndDesire | | Hes 18 and,if you'd like to know any other things about him DM me such as his fears,friends etc.

@SeventhSinPride "Hmmm..Sounds like a deal, only if you can actually cook really good and not burn the house down "
@DespairAdLonely "Good,you better not.. " She flashed him a small smile as she spoke with a kind voice
@SadisticWraith "Holy...Shit,how did you capture him,if I may ask?"
@SeventhSinPride "And what would you repay me with?  Hmm?" Greed watched the sin move closer to her,her brow slowly raising
@VirtueDiligence ~ lips,offering him a bright smile
@VirtueDiligence "Where would you like to go after this, my dear Sweet Diligence?.. " Alexis rose a brow as she slowly pulled away from his~
@VirtueDiligence "And,I for one think you're the most kindest man I've ever known " She smiled and leaned close to him kissing him softly
@SeventhSinPride "Well, that's your loss..I'm going out to get some and since you're not going anywhere, you just won't have any will you?"
@IncarnatedFury She hesitantly kissed him back,slowly wrapping her legs around his waist. Her fingers were entangled in his dark hair

@VirtueDiligence "No,you dork..I mean like you find me attractive like, not a friend like,Diligence "
@SeventhSinPride "Then go put some clothes on" She shrugged and slid off of the counter, walking over to the wine cabinet
@SeventhSinPride "Go out and get some or go by the strip club Lust works at, Maybe she'll give you money if you don't have any "
@IncarnatedFury "Zero..." She looked at him,once she felt his hand around her neck,she slowly moved both of his hands away from her body
@SeventhSinPride "We're all out if you're looking for liquor, Gluttony took the last bottle.... "
@KarmasBich "And What's like,Wait I know the answer but, /I/ wanna hear you say it" Alexis smirked
@VirtueDiligence "I don't see how virtue like you could ever like a sin like me." She shook her head and laughed
@SadisticWraith "Really?  How long has he been Down here?" She took her eye's off of the sobbing man to look over at Tavorben

@IncarnatedFury She slowly grabbed his hand, leading down towards her silk nightgown. Each kiss she gave him was filled with passion

@IncarnatedFury She leaned In close to him,kissing him with passion. Her hands moving up and down his body
@IncarnatedFury "Fine..but, don't cut me as much,Okay?" She couldn't Help but,giggle and look up at him
@IncarnatedFury "But,this is going to turn out just like last time,don't you think?"
@IncarnatedFury She let a small sound escape her lipstick covered lips as she moved his hand away from her nightgown
@IncarnatedFury "I'll be honest.. I did miss you.." She bit her lower lip when he placed his lips onto her neck
@IncarnatedFury "Fine..." She looked at him slowly wrapping her arms around him "Do what you want.."

@IncarnatedFury She turned onto her side,her back facing him as she closed her eye's
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh,/Fine/" She unzipped his pants, sliding them off of him "There?  Happy?"
@IncarnatedFury "Take them off yourself, Z"She laughed at his little name she gave him as she moved his head from her exposed leg
@IncarnatedFury "Keep your pants on...Zero"She took off her clothes not caring if he was there or not, she laid down onto her bed

@SeventhSinPride She went into her room,putting on new clothes before making her way into the kitchen
@VirtueDiligence "What do you mean by that?"She looked over at him,slowly raising a brow
@SeventhSinPride "You're welcome, Pride "She took her lighter back before getting up and leaving the bedroom to go to hers

@IncarnatedFury "Then fucking leave!"She screamed and pushed him out of her bedroom, slamming the door
@IncarnatedFury Once she heard his words, she quickly moved away from him "Fuck you! Never speak to me again you got that?!"
@IncarnatedFury "How?! You just tried to kill me! I've been trying to help you control it! Risking /my/ life to help you!"
@IncarnatedFury "Whatever... Just leave me alone if all you are going to do is be a complete asshole to me"
@IncarnatedFury "I don't think it bothers you,because I'm only stating the truth.. that's what you do,it's who you are,Zero"
@IncarnatedFury "Well,bye? Have fun fucking girls then killing them!" She mumbled as she finally looked over at him
@SeventhSinPride "Well,let me know whenever you want to do this again..I did actually enjoy it" Greed shrugged and lowered her brow
@SeventhSinPride "Well,I do like you my dear Pride but, this was meaningless for you am I correct? " She rose a brow,tilting her head
@IncarnatedFury "Why!? Just Fuck off..." She backed away and sat down on the edge of her bed,trying to avoid him as much as she could
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh,I'll be Fine...just go.." She tried to shut her bedroom door,keeping her eye's down to the floor
@SeventhSinPride "You are? My,my,my Pride you've lasted longer than I expected.. " She flashed him a small smirk and laughed
@IncarnatedFury "Just..leave me alone,alright?" She moved back slightly as he touched her wound,looking down a the wooden floor
@SadisticWraith "Oo, Just simply perfect..! "She smiled deviously and clapped quietly
@IncarnatedFury "What do you want,Zero...? " She sighed and slowly opened the door. Raising a brow as she looked at him

@DespairAdLonely "Love? Hell no...I just feel generous today that's all but,if you don't want my 'help' then I'll just leave you be"
@VirtueDiligence "Yup!" She laughed and looked down at him,smiling brightly
@DespairAdLonely "Good,I am feeling quite generous today that's Why I'm helping you"
@SeventhSinPride "Fuck...Pride " She moaned out,before pulling her lips away from his to look at him
@VirtueDiligence She hopped up onto his back,wrapping her arms and legs around him, she leaned in kissing his neck softly
@IncarnatedFury ~ she had took out from earlier, slowly taking out the knife from her shoulder, letting out a loud cry as she did

@DespairAdLonely "I mean I'll help you if you'll help me in the long run"
@VirtueDiligence "Fine,you can carry me!" She laughed and let go of his hand,smiling brightly.  She couldn't help but continue to laugh
@DespairAdLonely "It wouldn't bother me but, you'll owe me later, Okay?"
@SeventhSinPride She let her tongue slip inside his mouth as she kissed him,slowly running her fingers through his hair
@IncarnatedFury "Zero!Get off of me right now!"  She tried to push him off of her
@VirtueDiligence "You don't have to,I have two legs I can walk" She shrugged and looked at him
@IncarnatedFury "What do I do,Zero?! Because, I'm so confused with everything right now!!"
@IncarnatedFury "Why? I don't see Why you can't stand me!? Why are you around me if you can't stand me?!'" She screamed and sighed
@VirtueDiligence "We can go Back to the sand, if you really want to.." She shrugged and pulled him close to her
@DespairAdLonely "Well,I may be a sin but, Maybe I could help you with finding a meaning in life?"
@DespairAdLonely "Is that so? Well,all that hard work has really paid off" She flashed him a small smile
@VirtueDiligence "God,you're such a dork..but, I simply love it!" Alexis giggled and took a hold of one of his hands
@DespairAdLonely "Well,thank you. You're not bad looking yourself, and Yup we're real we take forms of humans so, no one gets suspicious "
@IncarnatedFury "What do you want from me?!"She screamed as she grabbed a knife from In the kitchen, holding it behind her back just in case
@DespairAdLonely "Well,that's true..but, I'd think she would like that, she's kinda freaky so,Yeah"
@VirtueDiligence "Good,I really do like you,Diligence and I think that will change, honestly " She flashed him a bright smile

@IncarnatedFury "Harder...Maybe this could turn out like it did last time,remember?" He did hurt her when he slammed her against the wall~
@SeventhSinPride {Kiss *}
@SeventhSinPride ~ much like her sister Lust, so she just kept quiet continuing  to his lips

@SadisticWraith "Can you show me what you have,Tavorben? "
@VirtueDiligence "You're /so/ lucky I like you or I would splash you again in stead of kissing you" She smiled against his lips as she spoke

@VirtueDiligence She stood up pulling off her shoes, then lifting up and taking off her shirt then shorts.

@IncarnatedFury Yup! 
@IncarnatedFury "We are!  But,Ugh! Just go away and avoid me for another century like last time" She started to yell this time
"I'm seeing a lot of shifters on my TL, not complaining though,they all seem pretty fucking Cool"
"Morning Fucker's" #online 
@DandyMott6 I'm good,how're you?

@VirtueDiligence "That'd be pretty fun,in by opinion! " She laugh and leaned in close to him and poking his cheek
@DandyMott6 Hello, Dandy

"To my new followers "♡ 

@KindestVirtue "Look,kid I'm a sin..I find things that are sad funny at time's "
"Oh,God...Kinky shit is going down on my.TL... " 
@IncarnatedFury ~ she felt something else...she couldn't explain it which was fucking odd,but she just didn't think about it too much
@IncarnatedFury "Ugh,Why would you want to know anyway! And don't call me princess"She crossed her arms as she watched him,she was mad but ~
@IncarnatedFury "Nothing,..Forget I said anything, alright? " She quickly pulled away once the song ended,relieved that it did
@IncarnatedFury ~ but,in a good way.."
@IncarnatedFury "I do? Is that a bad thing or a good thing?" She rose a brow as she flashed him a small smile "You drive me crazy as well~
@quick_sliver_ Well,if you want trouble you should hit up my sister Wrath she's always up for trouble
@IncarnatedFury ~ She hummed softly to the music as she slowly looked up at him
@IncarnatedFury She slowly laid her head on his chest as they danced,she blocked out the music. Remembering the last time they danced~
@quick_sliver_ "Nothing, honestly " 
@IncarnatedFury She leaned close to him,putting her index finger on his lips "Shh..don't Thank me..just get lost in the music,alright? "
@IncarnatedFury ~ wrapped her arms around his neck,holding him close
@IncarnatedFury "Fine,I'll put on a slow song just for you.." Alexis giggled and put on a slow song, she then walked back over to him~
@IncarnatedFury ~ "It's definitely not a slow song,it's called... Hold on "She thought for a moment "It's by ACDC it's called "The Jack"
@IncarnatedFury "You don't have to put your hands on my waist.. but you can if you'd like " She smirked and pulled away from his grip~
@IncarnatedFury ~ she grabbed his hand,making him stand up "Either leave or dance with me"
@IncarnatedFury "Just shut up and dance with me.." She was more assertive now unlike she use to be "You're the one who won't leave "~
@quick_sliver_  "Well,that's good to know" 
@IncarnatedFury "Then come on and dance with me" she swayed her hips to the music, holding her arms up as she did
@IncarnatedFury 
@quick_sliver_  "I can see that,Haha" 
@IncarnatedFury "Actually I didn't... I can promise you that, he just likes me" 
@IncarnatedFury "Yeah,you know I'm right..." 
@IncarnatedFury "He's kinda a virgin so,I'M no one's seconds.. like I said Fuck you!" 
@IncarnatedFury ~ got up,lighting a cigarette taking a long drag,she got up. Putting a record and pressing play
@IncarnatedFury She leaned close to him once again"Then get out of my fucking house..." She threw him off of her,giving him a smirk as she~
@IncarnatedFury "Fuck you,I don't have to keep my mouth shut" 
@IncarnatedFury "Why would I fucking hurt her? I find that funny that you think I would" 
@IncarnatedFury "Get out of here! Now!" She mumbled through the pillow, slowly raising her head and pushing him off of her bed completely
@quick_sliver_ "Oh my God! A duck!" 
@IncarnatedFury "Then don't you speak about Diligence that way..." 
@IncarnatedFury ~ laid on her bed,burying her face into her pillows
@IncarnatedFury "Princess?  Wow,really!  I'm not on some high horse...You're just so..Ugh! Forget about it..just leave me alone! " She ~

@IncarnatedFury "Same thing you fucking mean with Diligence " 
@IncarnatedFury "So,have you" 
@IncarnatedFury "He actually has feelings for me unlike, everyone else.." 
@IncarnatedFury "Diligence.. I guess you can say we're I thing? I dunno" 
Always.

|| At a butterfly park...with no goddamn butterflies... Best. Road.Trip.Ever.. <UNAMUSED FACE> 
@SeventhSinPride A small sound escaped her dark lipstick smeared lips as she gripped onto his hair once she felt him inside her
@VirtueDiligence "Yay,I was hoping you'd say that!" She giggled and kissed his cheek
@DeviantMurder ~ Alexis took off her black hat that she was wearing as she watched each of her brother's and sisters step inside
@DeviantMurder ~ which she saw no need to do,she just went a long with it due to the fact no one would agree with her and listen to her~
@DeviantMurder Alexis looked up at the house, her brother's and sister's thought would be perfect for them to spend the next century in~
"No one is worthy to have me" 
@SeventhSinPride ~ at all,she patiently waited for him
@SeventhSinPride "I don't think you'd could hurt me,honestly " She just simply nodded at his word's,she didn't believe he could hurt her~
@VirtueDiligence "Maybe,Why do you ask?" She slowly pulled away to look at him with her green eye's, keeping her arms around him
@DeviantMurder || Sure,give me one moment! ♡
@SeventhSinPride ~ index finger,giving him another playful wink
@SeventhSinPride "You should, if you want to" Greed looked up at the other deadly sin as shall twirled a strand of her brow hair with her~
@SadisticWraith "Good,so Why are you torturing this man, is there a reason behind it?"
@VirtueDiligence "Yup,we are immortal after all..we have all the time in a world!" She smiled brightly against his soft lips
@DeviantMurder ||Okay,Well how about she moved into the Murder house with her brother and sisters Maybe?I don't know<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@DeviantMurder || We should totally RP sometime,sweetie! 
"Oh,shit I can see a fight about to go on with Pride and Wrath..shit where's Gluttony with the popcorn?! "
@DeviantMurder || Aww, Thank you and you're not so bad yourself 
@VirtueDiligence ~ wrap her arms around his neck and to kiss his lips softly
@VirtueDiligence "Yeah, I don't think my brother's wouldnt  like it all too much if we told them this soon" She got on her tip toes to ~
@DeviantMurder | | Thank you for the follow and have a wonderful day or night which ever one! 
@SeventhSinPride She let out a small teasing moan beside his ear,rolling onto the bed and pulling him on top of her,giving him a small smirk

@VirtueDiligence "You think we should one day?" She smiled once she felt his lips on her cheek "Maybe, we should tell our families "
@SeventhSinPride "Hmm, well I did have something in mind but, it's all up to you, Pride" She let her thumb glide across his skin
@VirtueDiligence "I would.. I wouldn't just expect you to know how to do those type of things and expect you to do them right away"
@IncarnatedFury "That's... Uh Cute? I've been in this forbidden thing with a certain virtue.. ' 
@SeventhSinPride "So,what now my Sweet deadly sin?" She let her hand caress his cheek as she bit onto her red lower lip
@VirtueDiligence ~ head on his shoulder
@VirtueDiligence "Well,what if it was with me? Would you still be just as scared?" Alexis kept her attention onto him as she laid her~
@IncarnatedFury "Why would I touch her? Hmm? I'd have no reason to..I've been having strange feelings for someone too 
@VirtueDiligence "Oh,Yeah I forgot you were a virgin.. " She couldn't help but, giggle " I mean,. You'd like it honestly "
@IncarnatedFury "Because, so I know that's why " 
@VirtueDiligence "Far too what?' She looked over at him,slowly raising a brow. Slightly confused at what he meant by far too

@VirtueDiligence "So,you don't care what your or my family thinks? What if they find out and Lusts tries something with you?"
@SeventhSinPride Without speaking she ripped of his, throwing the shreds onto the floor beside the bed, leaning back in kissing him
@VirtueDiligence Alexis smiled brightly as she began to walk once more, keeping a hold of his hand "Do you think anyone would approve of us?
@SadisticWraith "That's good to know,but just be aware that I could trip and you'd have tl catch me pretty quickly "
@SeventhSinPride "Well,that's perfectly Fine" She smiled and pushed him down further onto the bed

@VirtueDiligence "Good,so are you ready to go to the beach?" She flashed him a bright smile,leaning in and kissing his cheek
@SeventhSinPride "Oh,really.. you think so? But, I wouldn't mind if you did" She giggled and kissed his lips once again
@VirtueDiligence "Oh,God..Is he mad or anything like that? " Alexis backed away slightly "Do you think he'd tell anyone? "
@SadisticWraith "I might...I'm very clumsy " She laughed and looked over at him
@VirtueDiligence "Well,that's good to hear..do you think any of your family or my family will find out?" She took a hold of his hand
@IncarnatedFury "I know you do,just admit it" 
@IncarnatedFury "Go Fuck some girl,Zero..." She stormed up her stairs and into her room
@SeventhSinPride "Maybe,you should.. my dear Pride" She leaned close to him,kissing him with passion and intensity
@VirtueDiligence "Surprise me,and as long as you're a gentleman this forbidden thing could work,don't you think?"
@IncarnatedFury "You don't need to lie to me,Zero" 
@IncarnatedFury "What do you want?..." She rose a brow as she crossed her arms
