When people take interest in something you love i.e. cheer leading &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shows they care
Some people show off their beauty for the world to see it, others try to hide their beauty because they want the world to see something else
I would rather have plans made for me than the usual "I don't care whatever you want to do." Don't tell me that!
This would be me everyday. Their relationship tho &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE THROWING A KISS><OK HAND SIGN>
