If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.
Actions will always prove why words mean nothing without them.
To achieve success, you have to know what failure feels like, learn from your mistakes and make the steps to improve.
Don't waste time on revenge. The people who hurt you will eventually face their own karma.
Set the standard, pave the way, be unique. If you always follow the crowd, you'll eventually get lost in it.
Life is a lot like a game, you can play it safe and be good, or you can take a chance and be great.
Life is a gift, not a right. So embrace it and live it to the fullest.
Before you assume, learn. Before you judge, understand. Before you hurt, feel. Before you say, think.
Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.
Remember that nobody makes it alone. Have a greatful heart and be quick to acknowledge those who help you.
A wise person knows that there is something to be learned from everyone.
You should forget about all the reasons why it wont work and believe the one reason why it will.
A lie has speed, but truth has endurance.
If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.
Pretending to be someone your not is a waste of the person you are.
Many people have ideas on how others should change, few people have ideas on how they should change.
Only in the darkness , you are able to see the stars.
If you can't take the heat, don't tickle the dragon.
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.
The truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride.
Faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to.
You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.
Until you spread your wings, you'll have no idea how far you can fly.
In the eyes of a child, you will see the world as it should be.
Just because it's not what you were expecting, doesn't mean it's not everything you've been waiting for
All of my kindness is mistaking for weakness
I've been fighting a fight that most people don't see or know about.
Seek respect not attention it lasts longer
Don't count the minutes, just the laughs. Enjoy the little things, and make them last.
Knowing what to say is one thing, but it's knowing when to say it that really makes the difference.
self love, self respect, and self worth. There is a reason why they all start with "self." You cannot find them in anyone else.
I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not.
If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.
Turn your face to the sun, and the shadows fall behind you.
The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said.
I can only show you the door. You're the one who has to walk through it.
It's better to be told the truth and hurt for a moment than to be told what you want to hear and hurt for a lifetime.
@_anniegirl left it out on the field. A loss means everything when ur able 2 learn 4rm ur mistakes. Come back even better.
@_anniegirl good luck today. Play ur game and have fun. I see winning in ur eyes &amp; strength in ur heart. Do ur thing.
@_Nish10 so now they are off to abq?
@_Nish10 it's crazy how fast your brother grew up. I still remember when he was a little tick when I first met him.
@_Nish10 wow really that's awesome!! Congrats to your brother!! That's awesome the won both this wkd!!
I'm just trying to live, stay strong and look after myself. All these years I have looked after others, now it's my time!!
@_Nish10 your brother win today?
You don't have to see something to know that it's really there. You just believe it.
Standing for what you believe in, regardless of the odds against you, and the pressure that tears at your resistance,...means courage.
Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth.
The choices we make, and the chances we take, determine our destiny.
I don't have to attend every argument I'm invited to.
The best way to escape your problem is to solve it.
Others can stop you temporarily, but only you can do it permanently.
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
Loyalty is hard to find, trust is easy to lose &amp; actions speak louder then word<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><OK HAND SIGN><INFORMATION DESK PERSON><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>

Don't make permanent decisions based off temporary feelings
You can't stop a person from doing what they want to do. They'll start lying to you to continue doing it.
Smile, things are going to work out. You may not see it now, but you‚Äôre being directed to a much greater happiness.
No matter how badly someone treats you, never drop down to their level. Remain calm, stay strong, and walk away.

My decisions may not be great. They might not even be good but they come from the heart just as they should.
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes it's the quiet voice at the end of the day that says: "I'll try again tomorrow."
What makes you different makes you beautiful.
When you are up in life, your friends get to know who you are. But when you are down in life, you get to know who your friends are.
The only people who can truly know your story are the ones who helped you write it.
Your worst battle is between what you know and what you feel.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
Genuine people don't come around too often. If you find somebody real enough to stay true, keep them close.

From good things, I learn to be a thankful person. From bad things, I learn to be a strong person.
Some words of advice to men: Treat women the same way you would want your daughter to be treated.
Keep your words short and sweet, because you never know which ones you will have to eat.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
Is it possible that all the mistakes you've made have been forgotten by everyone except yourself ??
I don't forgive people because I'm WEAK. I forgive people because I'm strong enough to realise that... everybody "makes" mistakes.
Life is easier when you're not complaining, worrying, or stressing about drama.
Great things come from small beginnings.
The sooner you realize it's never going to go back to the way it was, the sooner you will move on.
Nothing and no one can make you happy until you are happy with yourself.
Appreciate what you have and who you have, because the future can take it all away from you anytime.
Don't look at your struggles as obstacles. Look at your struggles as opportunities to learn and grow.

Sometimes all you can do is roll with the punches.
Sometimes you have to accept the truth and stop wasting time on the wrong people.
The hardest part about growing is letting go of what you were used to, and moving on with something you're not.
I need to learn how to be content with simply not knowing, and be at peace with the notion that everything does not need an explanation.
You can't stop a person from doing what they want to do. They'll start lying to you to continue doing it.
Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on others.

The biggest problem in the world could have been solved when it was small.
The reputation of a thousand years may be determined by the conduct of one hour.
We have a choice every day, to act on yesterday's good intentions or get an early start on tomorrow's regrets.
Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.
Sometimes it's more important to be human, than to have good taste.
Life is simple, it's just not easy.
Give it your best shot, make sure there are no room for regrets.
When everything is falling apart, there's no reason to fall with it.
Anyone can make you smile... but only certain people can make you happy.
Just because life isn't fair doesn't mean it isn't good
The things you go through will never truly be understood until you go through a similar situation. So don't judge.
What's out of your control isn't worth stressing.
Genuine people don't come around too often. If you find somebody real enough to stay true, keep them close.

Stop worrying about what you have to lose and start focusing on what you have to gain.
Look forward with hope, not backwards with regret.
Isn't it ironic that the only person who can make you really happy , is the same person who makes you sad and lonely?
Learn to smile at every situation. See it as an opportunity to prove your strength and ability.
Defeat is not bitter unless you swallow it.
To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have.
The future lies before you, like paths of pure white snow. Be careful how you tread it, for every step will show.
Sometimes the only way you can take a really good look at yourself is through somebody else's eyes.
Be nice to those you meet on the way up. They're the same folks you'll meet on the way down.
It is the false shame of fools to try to conceal wounds that have not healed.
The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.
Be still like a mountain and flow like a great river.
Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on others.
He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away.
When the world says, "Give up,"Hope whispers, "Try it one more time."
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
Nothing is interesting if you're not interested.
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic.
Be the light in the dark, be the calm in the storm and be at peace while at war.
We cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sails.
Too many people miss the silver lining because they're expecting gold.
If you can wear the hard times of your life as furrows on your brow, you can wear the good times as a twinkle in your eye.

Just because you have more than others doesn't mean your above anyone.
Don't run from the lessons in life. Anything that hurts you has the ability to teach you.
No matter how much it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize your struggles changed your life for the better.
The strongest people aren't always the people who win, but the people who don't give up when they lose.
Let your talent speak for itself.
Never allow your loyalty to become slavery. You only live once.
Always know you are more than enough. You are precious, unique, and worth being adored, cherished and treasured!
Don‚Äôt waste time on shitty people.
To free us from the expectations of others, there lies the great, singular power of self-respect.
The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are.
We all wear masks, and the time comes when we cannot remove them without removing some of our own skin.
The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere.
Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the pose.
Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth
No man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character.
Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life, define yourself.
Almost every man wastes part of his life in attempts to display qualities which he does not possess, and to gain applause which he cant keep
It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.

We all make mistakes. It's how we come back from the mistakes that matters.
Life is like a multiple choice question. Sometimes the choices confuses you, not the question itself.
Have more than you show,
And speak less than you know.
You may not understand today or tomorrow, but eventually God will REVEAL why you went through everything you did.
Knowing when to walk away is Wisdom. Walking away, with your head held high is Dignity.
Fill your life with experiences, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show.
You gotta look for the good in the bad, the happy in your sad, the gain in your pain, and what makes you grateful not hateful.
Attract what you expect, reflect what you desire, become what you respect, mirror what you admire.

Sometimes you don't realize your own strength until you come face to face with your greatest weakness.
To face the truth hurts, but to deal with lies is even worse.
When all doors behind you get shut, it's a sign that you need to stop looking back and start moving forward.
Trying and Doing are two different things. When you try, you hope. When you do, you succeed.
Laughter is a smile with the volume turned up.
We only see two things in people; what we want to see, and what they want to show us.
Stop worrying about what might hold you down, and pay attention to why you're standing up.
Those who are heartless once cared too much.

Enjoy every smile and every tear, because the most beautiful smile comes after the most painful tear.
God will only give you as much as you can handle because he knows how strong you are even if you dont.
A promise is a promise, at least that's what they say. Welcome to reality, they're broken everyday.
Your thoughts affect your emotions. Your emotions affect your decisions. Your decisions affect your life.
You just can't be nice all the time. Sometimes you just need to do the right things, not nice things.
Never push a loyal person to the point where they no longer care.
Sometimes the journey has to be travelled alone in order to appreciate the strengths that lie deep inside of us.
I don't hold grudges, you just become irrelevant.
Stop talking about what you‚Äôre going to do, just do it and let your actions speak for you.

I'm so excited for the fight this weekend
You learn in life that you need to take care of n√∫mero uno first.
God blesses those who give with a sincere heart not by how much you give or what you give. God doesn't care about that.
Tough situations build strong people.
Sometimes there is no next time, no timeouts, and no second chances. Sometimes It's Now or Never.
God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today. Have you used one to say thank you ?
Fill your life with experiences, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show.
Be so HAPPY that when others look at you they become HAPPY too.
Life has many different chapters. One bad chapter doesn't mean it‚Äôs the end of the book.
You are part of a puzzle in someones life. You may never know where you fit. But, someones life may never be complete without you in it
You change for two reasons. Either you learn enough that you want to or you've been hurt enough that you have to.
Sometimes you just gotta live with what you got, and forget about what you want.
You may see me struggle, but you will never see me fall.
A scar simply means you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you.
Like the sunrise, some things just have to happen and all you can do is watch.

You have to learn to say no without feeling guilty.Setting boundaries is healthy.You need to learn to respect and take care of yourself.
One smile, can start a friendship. One word, can end a fight. One look, can save a relationship. One person can change your life.
Look beyond your problems and you'll see solutions everywhere.
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy.
You can't help anyone as long as they don't want to help themself
Accepting someone into your heart, is easy..... the real problem is taking them out.
One must learn to accept change in life ,but mainly in themselves for survival.
With undeniable faith and hope... you can starve fear to death.
Your attitude is your outlook seen from the inside out.
Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you the best way they know how.
Worry doesn't empty tomorrow of it's sorrow, it empties today of its strength.
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
It's important to remember that we cannot become what we need to be, by remaining what we are.
Know your worth. Know what you deserve. And know when it's time to move on.
Can't make everyone one happy.
No one knows what you feel but yourself
We learn from every mistake we make. Let's not judge people who make mistakes because we make them too.
If it was meant to be an eye for an eye the whole world would be blind.
Pretty words aren't always true and true words aren't always pretty.
Your past is just a story. Once you realize this, it has no power over you.
A house doesn't become a home until love moves in.
Sometimes the blessings are not in what he gives ; but in what he takes away.
Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go, they simply determine where you start.
If You Tell The Truth, It Becomes A Part Of Your Past. If You Lie, It Becomes A Part Of Your Future.
A handshake is a powerful thing....it can turn an enemy into a friend.
I have had so much support from people I have never expected &amp; the ones I expected to support hardly did.
People are so quick to judge others faults, but never quick to point out their own
Think before you speak, because once you say it, you can't take it back.
The biggest regret that people have on their deathbed is that they lived the life expected of them instead of a life true to themselves.
Passion changes everything.
Don't run from the lessons in life. Anything that hurts you has the ability to teach you.
The harder the life, the stronger you'll become. The stronger you become, the easier the life will be.
Do what is right, not what is easy.
I'm always grateful when God lets me see another day.
Time is a thief....it sneaks up on you and steals your youth.
People ask me why is it so hard to trust others. The real question is, why is it so hard for others to tell the truth.
The only thing worse than not finding happiness is finding it and throwing it away.
Sometimes you have to die a little on the inside first in order to be reborn and rise again as a stronger, smarter version of yourself.
If through a broken heart God can bring His purposes to pass in the world, then thank Him for breaking your heart.
A dream is a wish your heart makes.
That's when you know someone is real if they pray for you more then they pray for themself.
We should always speak from the heart.
A woman is so much more than thighs &amp; hips.
Do you know who you are?

Everyone makes mistakes in life, but that doesn't mean they have to pay for it the rest of their lives.
Sometimes there are things you have to do, even if you don't want to.
Don't try to understand everything. Sometimes it is not meant to be understood just accepted.
People change. You have to get used to it.
Most of the time we plan in the moment and not thing about the future.
If you don't start appreciating what's right in front of you, you may lose it.
You can judge someone all you want, but thats never gonna tell you the truth about someone. Take a second to get to know them first.
You will never find yourself until you face the truth.
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak, but is also, what it takes to sit and listen.
No matter how much you love someone don't go against your values and your beliefs.
Freedom is not to be taken lightly.....some have paid a heavy price.
Sometimes life isn't about meeting new people, it's about meeting the people you already know halfway.
A valuable lesson that a traffic singal teaches us, every problem is like a red signal if you wait for some time it will turn green.
Everyone gets old...not everyone grows up.
Be so busy loving your life that you have no time for hate, regret or fear.

As soon as you can learn to let go, you can continue to grow.
Take a risk. You never know what it could lead to.
Just because life isn't fair doesn't mean it isn't good
Sometimes it takes sadness to know happiness, noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence.
They say the eyes are the windows to the soul.
Everyone deserves to live the life that they want not the lives that others want.
Be the type of person you want to meet.
We need more of encouragement for others to express themselves and not deny or cut down who they are.

People tend to confuse being mean with being honest.
Life is weird. First you wanna grow up, then you want to be a kid again.
Avoiding something doesn't mean you don't want it. Sometimes, it means that you do want it, but you know it isn't right for you.
Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
Sometimes you need the bad things in life to appreciate the good ones.
Most people are surprised to discover that the winds of change often bring with them a breath of fresh air.
Life is like a coin. You can spend it any way you wish, but you only spend it once.
Never cut what can be untied.
The future may seem light years away, but somehow it always seems to arrive at warp speed.

Think before you speak, because once you say it, you can't take it back.
When life knocks you down.. calmly get back up, smile, and very politely say, "You hit like a girl."
We are all just sunlight....it's when we go through rain that we show our true colors.
If you don't believe in miracles, perhaps you've forgotten you are one.
Don't judge somebody just because they sin differently than you.
Live simply. Love generously. Speak truthfully. Pray daily. Leave everything else to God.
Everyone you meet has something valuable to teach you.
Go where your effort is appreciated. Don't let your actions go unnoticed by individuals who are never satisfied.
Don‚Äôt let someone who doesn‚Äôt know your value tell you how much you‚Äôre worth.
Your thoughts affect your emotions. Your emotions affect your decisions. Your decisions affect your life.

I grew up watching the Olsen twins. It would be nice to see them again on coming back Full House.
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
The impossible can always be broken down into possibilities.
We can't control the wind but we can adjust the sails.
Too many people miss the silver lining because only watching for gold.
An apology is the best way to have the last word.
Do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own. You may both be wrong.
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
The only way you may correct the bad things in your past is to add better things to your future.
Have a heart that never hardens, a temper that never tires, a touch that never hurts.
Don‚Äôt let someone who doesn‚Äôt know your value tell you how much you‚Äôre worth.

I'd take a few people saying a sincere prayer for me over thousands of people saying they were praying for me and it be not true
Silence and smiles are two powerful tools. Smiles are the way to solve many problems and silence is the way to avoid many problems
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them.
When desire dies, fear is born.
You have to know how to accept 
Rejection and reject acceptance.
The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand.We listen to reply.
When you are going through difficulty &amp; wonder where GOD is, REMEMBER that the teacher is always quiet during the test.
The best view comes after the hardest climb.
Happiness is found when you stop comparing yourself to other people.
Everyone comes with baggage.
Find someone who loves you enough to help you unpack.
If you believe strongly in something, don't be afraid to fight for it.
Don‚Äôt miss out on something that could be great just because it could also be difficult.
One of the most courageous decisions you'll ever make is to finally let go of what is hurting your heart and soul.
Happiness is found when you stop comparing yourself to other people.
Never judge someone without knowing the whole story. You may think you understand, but you don't.
One moment of patience may ward off great disaster. One moment of impatience may ruin a whole life.
Jumping at several small opportunities may get us there more quickly than waiting for one big one to come along.
You will learn something new every day if you pay attention.
Kindness is like a boomerang.
We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.
Treat everyone with politeness, even those who are rude to you - not because they are nice, but because you are.
A fellow who does things that count, doesn't usually stop to count them.
It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.
Never look down on anybody unless you're helping him up.
People who fight fire with fire end up with only the ashes of their own integrity.

It's okay if sometime you get it wrong
In all my life I have learned there is no shame in falling. The shame is falling but not getting up.
Mistakes are what makes you a person
@laacyG your a Damien fan over Stefan huh

@vasquezE3 when time come to move on don't forget the little people <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
A person who listens is gold. Too many people just wait for their chance to speak, without feeling your energy and where you're coming from.
Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.
Don't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.
Never let a problem to be solved become more important than the person to be loved.
Most of the shadows of this life are caused by our standing in our own sunshine.
Words are very powerful. Use them to lift someone up rather than knock someone down.
There are something's that happen that you can't stop, but that's not a reason to shut out the world.
Better is the poor man that walks in integrity then a rich man that walks in crooked ways
Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else.
Things turn out best for the people who make the best out of the way things turn out.
Life's problems wouldn't be called "hurdles" if there wasn't a way to get over them.
Great ideas need landing gear as well as wings.
Deal with your problems before they deal with your happiness.
Good people are like candles, they burn themselves up to give others light.
Fake people don‚Äôt surprise me anymore, loyal people do.
Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing, some people are not even worth your words.

It doesn't matter how many "resources" you have if you don't know how to use them.
If someone is proud of their body, don't judge them for that.
You can't grow if you're still stuck in the past. Let it go and move on.
There's always something good coming. Remember that.
When you look back you see how fast time flies.
Just how when you try on shoes how you try on different sizes to see which one fits sometimes that's what happens to paths.
Stop complaining and just appreciate the life you have.
Mistakes are meant for learning, not repeating.
Inhale the love, exhale the hate.
Never let your past define your future.
You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.
We are not given a good life or a bad life. We are given life. And it's up to you to make it good or bad.
We don't stop dreaming and exploring because we grow old. We grow old because we stop dreaming and exploring.

Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
People can only take advantage of you if you let them.
Not everyone will like you, that's life.
Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day.
Promise only what you can deliver. Then deliver more than you promise.
Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.

The two hardest things in life are hello for the first time and goodbye for the last.
Believe with your eyes, not with your ears.
You're stronger than you know. You just gotta believe in yourself.
Life is too short to hide your feelings. Don't be afraid to say what you feel.
Angels on the earth get called first to be at peace and prepare the kingdom to become our loving home.
After I end up putting a song as my ringtone I end up hating it after a while.
People won't always tell you how they feel, but they'll show you. Pay attention.
Good looks fade. But a good heart keeps you beautiful forever.
When you have a good heart: You help too much. You trust too much. You give too much. You love too much &amp; it always seems you hurt the most
A pretty face doesn't mean a pretty heart.
Difficult roads often lead to great destinations.

Don't ever change just to impress or please someone. Change because it makes you a better person and it leads you to a better future.
Don't hate what you don't understand.
Dont lose hope. When the sun goes down, the stars come out.
Actions speak louder than words. We can apologize over and over, but if our actions don't change, the words become meaningless.
People will judge you no matter what you do... so you might as well do what you want.
Open your mind before you open your mouth.
As long as your happy place makes you happy that's all that matters.

Not everyone will see eye to eye with you.
Sometimes it takes losing everything you have to finally grow and find yourself.
The desire to reach for the stars is ambitious. The desire to reach hearts is wise.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
Every day is a chance to turn it around. Make today that day.
It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.
Minds are like parachutes - they only function when open.
The best people all have some kind of scar.
Don't bring up the past of a person who is trying to improve their future.
A word of encouragement after failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
When you focus on wanting what you can't have, you fail to appreciate what's right in front of you.
The hardest part of acting like you dont care, is knowing how much you actually do.
The strongest people are not those who show strength in front of us, but those who win battles we know nothing about.
I‚Äôm stronger because of my hard times, wiser because of my mistakes, and happier because of my sad experiences.
To heal a wound you need to stop touching it.
Let people do what they need to do to make them happy. Mind your own business, and do what you need to do to make you happy.
Strength doesn‚Äôt come from winning.Ur struggles develop ur strength. When u go through hardship &amp; decide not to surrender, that is strength.
I don't think people understand that you can forgive a person and not allow them back into your life. That is possible, very possible.
Step up to the challenge, believe in yourself, and do what it takes. Right now is a great time to start.

Train your mind and heart to see the good in everything. There is always something to be grateful for.
When thinking about life, remember this: no amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future.
Always keep a piece of you for you. That's not selfish, that's survival.
See light where others see shadow. See opportunities where others see obstacles.
Be grateful for what you do have, not bitter for what you don't.
A great future doesn‚Äôt require a great past.
The smarter you get, the less you speak.
The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.
We will all in some point in our life fall.

Everyone makes mistakes. If you can't forgive others, don't expect others to forgive you.
Everybody deserves a second chance, but not for the same mistake.
Learn to control your anger, before your anger dictates the path you take in life.
Instead of putting people down all your life, inspire someone, change someone‚Äôs life for the better, make someone happy, make someone smile.
Appreciate it while it's there.
I am made of flaws stitched together with good intentions
If you're helping someone and expecting something in return, you're doing business not kindness.
Disappointments were not meant to destroy you. They were meant to strengthen you and give you fortitude to accomplish your destiny.
Always remember to be the woman you'd want your son to marry.
Do not mock a pain that you haven‚Äôt endured.
No matter the situation, never let your emotions overpower your intelligence.
Light is always more beautiful when it has to fight to be noticed, like sunlight fighting through the clouds after a rainstorm.
When life becomes difficult, you must change yourself to become stronger.
Stop planting flowers in peoples yards who aren‚Äôt going to water them.
Some people are going to love you no matter what you do. And some people will never love you no matter what you do.
Stop beating yourself up. You are a work in progress - which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Sometimes the most valuable lessons come from people who didn't intend to give them.
People will notice the change in your attitude towards them, but won't notice their behavior that made you change.
Growth is a process. You gain, you lose, you cry, you grow, you learn, you try, you fail but you keep trying. Time is the real luxury.
It costs $0.00 to be a decent person.
Everybody isn‚Äôt going to love you. Most people don‚Äôt even love themselves.
Blaming others for your problems is like blaming donuts for being fat. It wasn't the donut, it was the choice.
Stop beating yourself up. You are a work in progress - which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.
Don't be afraid of change. You may end up losing something good, but you'll probably end up gaining something so much better.
How someone reacts to your sadness says a lot about how long they‚Äôre going to be in your life.

Remember all your actions have consequences.
Sometimes the most valuable lessons come from people who didn't intend to give them.
Your past has given you the strength and wisdom you have today, so celebrate it. Don‚Äôt let it haunt you.
I find it really beautiful when someone prays for you without you knowing. I don't think there's any form of deeper and purer love.
Sometimes you just have to step forward, and move on. No questions, no doubts, no looking back. Just move on.
Give but don't allow yourself to be used. Love but don't allow your heart to be abused. Listen to others but don't lose your own voice.
If you walk the footsteps of a stranger. You'll learn something new.
A true hero is not measured by his size and strength but by the size of his heart.
Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.
Remember that nobody makes it alone. Have a greatful heart and be quick to acknowledge those who help you.
A wise person knows that there is something to be learned from everyone.
Learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue all that you want.
Focus on what's really important.
There's a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Pain alters our personality.
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy.
No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again.
Change is inevitable, but progress is optional.

The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said.
I can only show you the door. You're the one who has to walk through it.
If you think only sunshine brings you happiness, then you haven't danced in the rain.
A lie has speed, but truth has endurance.
Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you don't have to apologize when you do something wrong.
The truth is hard to swallow when you're choking on your pride.
The quieter you become, the more you can hear.
Everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain, but you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.
Until you spread your wings, you'll have no idea how far you can fly.
Just because it's not what you were expecting, doesn't mean it's not everything you've been waiting for
Love is sweet when it's new. But it is sweeter when it's true!!
You do what you can with what you have
Everyone is human and not perfect but after a while that's just an excuse.
Most people want truth but can't handle the truth
You have to learn how to accept rejection and reject acceptance.
Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can change your life forever.
Obstacles are things a person sees when he takes his eyes off his goal.
Great things come to those who work hard and never give up.
Stop looking at what you don't have, and start being thankful for what you do have.
Don't lose what's really important chasing your pot of gold.
This week is going by slow
When God wants you to grow he makes you uncomfortable.
There is beauty in simplicity.
Everyone should get a fighting chance.
It's easy to fake something. What's hard is to come through in your actions.
The only way to measure success is how happy you are. Shit ain't about the money, cars, nothing but happiness!
Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things.
Once you learn how to be happy, you won't tolerate being around people who make you feel anything less.
Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.
It is only in our darkest hours that we may discover the true strength of the brilliant light within ourselves that can never,ever,be dimmed
Don't compare your progress with that of others. We all need our own time to travel our own distance.
Opportunity may knock only once, but temptation leans on the doorbell.

Things will get worse before they get better. But when they do, remember who put you down and who helped you up.
No one has the right to judge you. They might have heard your stories, but they didn¬ít feel what you were going through.
Sometimes you have to let things go, so there's room for better things to come into your life

Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life.

Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
Head up, heart open. To better days!
Life is about being happy and taking everything as it comes. Smile, think positive.
No matter how many times you fall, you gotta be strong and get back up.
In one minute you can change your attitude and in that minute you can change your entire day.
No matter how much it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize your struggles changed your life for the better.
People will hate you, rate you, break you, and shake you. How strong you stand is what makes you.
Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.
We are all just works in progress
Don't waste time on revenge. The people who hurt you will eventually face their own karma.
You don't realize what kinda damage your doing until the damage is already done.
Gotta leave the past in the past.
How many times do you have to say not to get burn by the same flame twice
physical attractions are common, but a mental connection is rare.
Trust and promises means everything but once its broken, a thousand sorry means nothing.
People always change after being hurt.
The strongest people aren't always the people who win, but the people who don't give up when they lose.
Your words mean nothing when your actions are the complete opposite.
Learning is a gift. Even when pain is your teacher.
The bond that links your true family is not only one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.

SMALL changes can make a BIG difference.
Once you've accepted your flaws no one can use them against you.
You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.
Honestly, as long as you're happy, who the hell cares?
Break bad habits by creating new ones and replacing them with better ones.
Slow and steady enjoys the race.
@_MVPey happy Easter buddy <RABBIT FACE><BOUQUET> hope ur family &amp; u are well &amp; ur doing good.

Make your smile change the world, but don't let the world change your smile.
You'll never truly understand until it happens to you.
Always say what you mean and mean what you say. Express how you feel and don't ever apologize for being real.
Before you assume, learn. Before you judge, understand. Before you hurt, feel. Before you say, think.
I don‚Äôt think people understand how stressful it is to explain what‚Äôs going on in your head when you don‚Äôt even understand it yourself.
You can't make the same mistake twice. The second time you make it, it's no longer a mistake, it's a choice.
Mental toughness can take you to the top, and mental weakness straight to the bottom.
No one can go back and make a brand new start; however anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.
Don‚Äôt tell people your plans. Show them your results.
Stop creating problems that don't exist.

Now a days all people like to do is bitch and complain.
It's easy to want. It's hard to actually earn &amp; work for what you want.
Things aren't always going to go your way. Just gotta learn how to be flexible.
Hardest thing ever? Controlling your laughter at serious times.
Sometimes saying no words are better than the wrong words.
Sometimes sorry isn't enough.
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
People will question all the good things they hear about you but believe all the bad without a second thought.
The story of your life has many chapters. One bad chapter doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the end of the book.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
The less people you have in your business, the less drama you will have in your life.
Timing is everything. The things you are praying for will show up when you are most ready for them.
The biggest obstacles in our lives are the barriers our mind creates.
A person is not rewarded for having brains, but only for using them.
Always put your best foot forward--but don't step on other people's toes.

The day you stop blaming others is the day you begin to discover who you truly are.
Success doesn't always come from the big actions we take, but from the sum of all small actions we repeat.
People are quick to judge but slow to correct themselves.
Everybody needs somebody sometimes.
The greatest battles are won on our knees.
You never really know the true value of a moment, until it becomes a memory
Forgive others. Not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
We fear rejection, want attention, crave affection, and dream of perfection.
Don‚Äôt let yourself be controlled by three things: people, money, or past experiences.
People change, things go wrong. But just remember, life goes on.
Do not give up, the beginning is always the hardest.
I ain't gonna say nuttin. Just keep it to myself.
When is the last time you did something for the first time.
This wkd I'm calling Michigan State &amp; Kentucky to go to the finals <BASKETBALL AND HOOP><TROPHY>
It's amazing what we can accomplish if we just try. Never lose hope. The trials that we face today are strengthening us for tomorrow.
You can't live your life for other people. You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love.
Life consists not in holding good cards, but in playing those cards you hold well.
Learn to give without any reason.
It's better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life.
If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think another negative thought.
Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion.
Love like there's no tomorrow, and if tomorrow comes, love again.

Trust is a very fragile thing.
We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.
Stop running away from your problems because that only increases the distance from the solution. Make it right today, tomorrow is too late.
Don't let someone else's problem become your problem.
Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words.
Never discourage anyone ... who continually makes progress, no matter how slow.
Why compare yourself with others? no one in the entire world can do a better job of being you
A word of encouragement after failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
No matter how long you have traveled in the wrong direction, you can always turn around.
Life is about kicking ass, not kissing it.
Stick with your word and stay true to your work.
Don't build your stepping blocks too high for you to keep on succeeding.
When ur a kid u argue w/ ur parents, when ur a teenager u can't wait 2 get away from them &amp; as u get older they become ur best friends.
Allergies suck ass <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Coffee genuinely makes me a better person and easier to deal with.
Don't compare yourself to others, you are you. No one could come close to being you even if they tried.
Believe in yourself &amp; all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
I'm strong, because I've been weak. I'm fearless, because I've been afraid. I'm wise, because I've been foolish.
You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep rereading the last one.
Genuinely true kind hearted people are a rare breed.
Don't fall for sweet words. Fall for sweet actions.
Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
Difficult doesn't mean impossible. 
Diet doesn't mean deprivation. 
Giving your best doesn't mean perfection.
Slow progress is better than no progress.
An ugly personality can easily destroy a pretty face.
Don't give up a lifetime of happiness for a few minutes of pleasure.
Life is easier when you're not complaining, worrying, or stressing about bullshit.
As you grow older, you realize it becomes less important to have more friends and more important to have real ones.
The moment you feel like you have to prove your worth to someone is the moment you need to walk away from them.
Be thankful for the struggles you go through. They make you stronger and wiser. Don't let them break you. Let them make you.
Believe you could and that you can.
Patience is bitter, but it's fruit is sweet.
It's the bird that flies solo that has the strongest wings. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to fly solo, if that means you become a survivor.
Trials without God will break you. Trials with God will make you.
When you face difficult times, know that challenges are not sent to destroy you. They're sent to promote, increase and strengthen you.
You get what you give.<BALLOON><SPARKLES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
When things aren't working out as you wish, be patient. Stop trying to move ahead of God. His timing is perfect.
Calling a girl fat does more damage then you can ever imagine.
Others are quick to judge but don't take the time to understand.
I pray, not wish. Because I have God.. Not a genie. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Happy April Fools day <PARTY POPPER><CONFETTI BALL>
If you never had homemade flour tortillas you are definitely missing out.
I think one of the greatest feelings in the world is when someone openly tells you how much you mean to them. Stuff like that is so rare.
The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything but they make the most of everything.
Always believe something wonderful is going to happen.Even with all the ups and downs, never take a day for granted.
The person you took for granted today, may turn out to be the person you need tomorrow.
Give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.
Happiness isn't about getting what you want all the time. It's about loving what you have and being grateful for it.
Difficulties in life are intended to make us better, not bitter.
Don't judge me. You can't handle half of what I've dealt with. There's a reason I do the things I do, there's a reason I am who I am.
Trust before you love. Know before you judge. Commit before you promise. Forgive before you forget. Appreciate before you regret..
Make the most of today because tomorrow is not promised to anyone.
Don't be afraid. God will guide us.

May the greatness of our past pale in comparison to the glory in our future.
Never erase your past. It shapes who you are today, and will help you to be the person you'll be tomorrow.
I'm human. I have weaknesses, I make mistakes, and I experience sadness; but I learn from all these things and they make me a better person.
Everything you've been through was preparation for where you are right now, and where you can be tomorrow.
Giving up doesn't always mean you are weak, sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go.
I'm Team Pacquiao for next month
Sometimes too much information is not a good thing.
People change, feelings fade, things go wrong, memories remain but life goes on.
Commitment leads to action. Action brings your dreams closer.
You were born to make mistakes, not fake perfection.
Even those who never frown, eventually break down.
I learn from my mistakes.
I need a Dorota in my life <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Letting go isn't easy, but it's necessary.
The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention.
Be a voice, not an echo.
Not everyone is going to be a fan of yours, oh well, can't please everyone.
Believe in yourself enough to know that other people's negative opinions of you don't matter. Rise above all that &amp; keep moving forward.
Do what is right, not what is easy.
Take this moment to appreciate what you have.
Nobody can change a person, but someone can be the reason for a person to change.
There are two types of pain in this world: pain that hurts you, and pain that changes you.

Struggles are required in order to survive in life, because in order to stand up, you gotta know what falling down is like.
Beauty is not defined by the size of your jeans but by the size of your heart.
There are many things in life to be thankful for, so don't let one ungrateful individual ruin your entire day.
Honestly, I don't have time to hate people who hate me, because I'm too busy loving people who love me.
You don't always have to be the best in everything you do. You just have to be willing to try and never give up.
Don't be too hard on yourself. There are plenty of people willing to do that for you. Do your best and surrender the rest.
Saying sorry doesn't solve the problem. It's what you do after that truly counts.
In daily life we must see that it is not happiness that makes us grateful, but gratefulness that makes us happy.
No PLL today <PENSIVE FACE> I hate when PLL's seasons end.
Embrace who you are. You have been given every tool, every talent, and every trait you need to realize your destiny.

Complaining doesn't help anything.

Seek respect, not attention. It lasts longer.
Your struggles develop your strengths.
Gucci with the forecast 
Failure to prepare is preparation for failure. Prepare for the worst while expecting the best.
You have to go through the worst to get the best.
Be nice to those you meet on the way up. They're the same folks you'll meet on the way down.
Running away and giving up won't solve your problems. Instead embrace it and don't let go until you have what you want
You cant change yesterday, you cant predict tomorrow... Live now and don't take it for granted
Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change
Happiness would never come to those who fail to appreciate what they already have
Nobody‚Äôs perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. But some mistakes will teach you great lessons and make you a better person.
Cinderella is proof that a new pair of shoes can change your life
Life always offers you a second chance,it's called tomorrow
Don't underestimate yourself with others, its our differences that make us unique and beautiful .

Pay close attention to the people that don't clap for you when you succeed.
Flour or corn tortillas? One of the hardest questions that anyone can ask you.
Don't say ‚Äòsorry‚Äô if you don't mean it.
Be comfortable with yourself, stop trying to win others approval. Real people will respect the real you.
Surround yourself with positive people who will support you when it rains, not just when it shines
Running away and giving up won't solve your problems. Instead embrace it and don't let go until you have what you want.
After yesterday's loss saltiness is at an extreme high
You'll never Realize how strong You are, until being Strong is the only Choice you have Left.
If your plan isn't working, adjust your plan. Never give up.
We should give meaning to life, not wait for life to give us meaning.
You can hope for a miracle in your life, or you can realize that your life is the miracle.

If I could go back 3-4 years knowing what I know now, I would do things so differently.
I'm ready for the game to start.
The grind doesn't wait for anyone.
Refuse to lose, refuse to be defeated, refuse to be cheated and refuse to have regrets.
Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do.
If your plan isn't working, adjust your plan. Never give up.
Nothing is too small to know, and nothing is too big to attempt.
Game day <BEAR FACE> <DOWNWARDS BLACK ARROW>Ô∏è 
It is better to fail in originality then to succeed in imitation.
Stand up for something, even if it means standing alone. Because often times, the one who flys solo has the strongest wings.
Keeping baggage from the past will leave no room for happiness in the future.
Be strong enough to stand alone, smart enough to know when you need help, and brave enough to ask for it.
Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Take the moment you have and make it perfect.
Don't let people make you feel bad or guilty for living your life. It is your life. Live it the way you want.
Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.
Happiness is a choice that requires effort at times.

Make the most of the best and the least of the worst.
The sun won't shine until you put the umbrella away.
The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited or erased; it can only be accepted.
Don't give up a lifetime of happiness for a few minutes of pleasure.
There's a currency more valuable than money... It's called time.
Respect is earned. Honesty is appreciated. Trust is gained. Loyalty is returned.
Don't be distracted by a beautiful wrapping paper.
If you want blunt, I'll give you a blunt answer. But if your not ready to hear the truth don't ask me.
When the world says, "Give up,"Hope whispers, "Try it one more time."
To the question of your life, you are the only answer. To the problems of your life, you are the only solution.
Life is not about discovering our talents; it is about pushing our talents to the limit and discovering our genius.
Put your future in good hands - your own.
If you judge people, you have no time to love them.
‚ûî Without dreams
‚ûî We reach nothing.
‚ûî Without love.
‚ûî We feel nothing.
‚ûî Without God.

Never stop believing in hope because miracles happen everyday.
Be a reflection of what  you'd like to see in others.
Be thankful for all you have now, because the next moment isnt promised. Life is so sturdy but also so fragile. It can be gone in an instant
Don‚Äôt carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones.

Don't treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
No one can change a person but a person can be the reason someone changes.
One smile, can start a friendship. One word, can end a fight. One look, can save a relationship. One person can change your life.
A smile is the light in your window that tells others that there is a caring, sharing person inside.
One of the most courageous decisions you'll ever make is to finally let go of what is hurting your heart and soul.
Love yourself for who you are, because I know deep down inside you are beautiful.
When you are up in life, your friends get to know who you are. But when you are down in life, you get to know who your friends are.
There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.
I might not have all the tools in my tool box to help me out in life but I will do my best to make it work.

Don't let bitter people change how awesome you are.
We all wear masks, and the time comes when we cannot remove them without removing some of our own skin.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
The most exhausting thing in life is being insincere.
Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the pose.
Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth
There is just one life for each of us, our own.

Sometimes you wish others can see themselves the way you see them.
You Never Understand A Person Until You Consider Things From His Point Of View.
Hard Times Are Like A Washing Machine...
They Twist, Turn &amp; Knock Us Around. But In The End We Come Out Cleaner.
God does not ask for your ability or your inability he asks only your availability.
Remember, the struggle you are in today is developing your strength for tomorrow.
Real Strength Comes From Your
Ability To Walk In Your Own Shoes
And Not The Shoes Of Others.
Everybody wants the TRUTH but nobody wants to be HONEST.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.
Try and fail, but don't fail to try.
Believe with all of your heart that you will do what you were made to do. Live a life of purpose.
Don't draw up conclusions without all the facts.
Before you say something, imagine how you would feel if someone told it to you
Avoiding something doesn't mean you don‚Äôt want it. Sometimes, it means that you do want it, but you know it isn't right for you.
Time doesn't wait for anybody
Everyone wants happiness. No one wants pain. But you can't have a rainbow, without a little rain.
Smile defeats pain. Forgiveness defeats bitterness. Trust defeats doubt. Commitment defeats boredom. Changes defeats failure
Sometimes you expect more from someone, because you would do that much for them.
Having a loyal friend is more valuable then money.
A good life is when you smile often, dream big, laugh a lot, and realize how blessed you are for what you have.
Avoiding something doesn't mean you don‚Äôt want it. Sometimes, it means that you do want it, but you know it isn't right for you.

Stop worrying about what might hold you down, and pay attention to why you're standing up.
Don't be ashamed of your failure. Those who love you will understand. Those who insult you, you don't need them.
Sometimes life gives you the test before you've had time to learn the lesson.
Don't look where you fall, but where you slipped.
Even the most beautiful mirror can be shattered by the smallest stone.
Everyone smiles in the same language.

Fight for what you believe in, and stand by what you fight for.
The worst feeling is regretting not having done something when you had the chance.
Your happiness is what truly matters most. Do what you have to do in order to be happy.
Always have the strength to carry on, no matter what.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
Always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.
If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.
The biggest obstacles in our lives are the barriers our mind creates.
Once you've accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.
@RavenChavanne happy happy cake day <PARTY POPPER><BIRTHDAY CAKE><CONFETTI BALL><ICE CREAM><BALLOON><WRAPPED PRESENT> enjoy your special day. Have a good bday legend 88. Have a good beginning to a new year.
You can't change the past, so focus on making a great future.
To achieve greatness, start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.
The past was never a mistake if you learned from it.
@DanaeHays congrats on your amazing play yesterday making sports centers top 10 <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> you always find a way to go above and beyond <FISTED HAND SIGN> pound it.
The greatest teacher you can have in life is experience.
You cannot let where you start define where you will end up.
Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate.
The less people you have in your business, the less drama you will have in your life.
Too many people are living for compliments, instead of living for accomplishments.
Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you've ever been, to stand up taller than you than you ever were.
On the road to success; there's a curve called failure, a loop called confusion, speed bumps called friends &amp; red lights called enemies.
No matter who you are, no matter what you did, no matter where you've come from, you can always change, become a better version of yourself.

Start everyday with a new hope, leave bad memories behind and have faith for a better tomorrow.
In the end you should always do the right thing even if it's hard.
Keeping baggage from the past will leave no room for happiness in the future.

Don't try to be something that your not.
Learn to give more, and expect less. You'll be happier that way.
Use your smile to change this world. Don't let this world change your smile.
Some of the best things come when you least expect them.
You were born an original, don't die a copy. Be Yourself!
I would rather have an honest enemy, than a fake friend.
Be real, be yourself, be unique, be true, be honest, be humble, be happy.
Keep your expectations low and your hopes high.
You will never truly understand something until it actually happens to you.

Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove.
Disappointments were not meant to destroy you. They were meant to strengthen you &amp; give you fortitude to accomplish your God-given destiny.
Sometimes we're tested. Not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths.
My life isn't perfect, but I'm thankful for everything I have.
You live, you learn, you move on.
Keep your head up, live life how you want, don't care what others think.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
Everyone has their problems. People react differently to them.
The only thing in this world that you have for sure control over is your life. Don't give that up.
The naked truth is always better than someone's best dressed lie.
Being a mother is discovering strengths you didn't know you had and dealing with fears you never knew existed.
Give more, expect less.
We can't become what we need to be by remaining what we are.
When you talk, you are repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you may learn something new.
Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality
Count your rainbows, not your thunderstorms.
In this life we cannot always do great things. But we can do small things with great love.
Be sure to taste your words before you spit them out.
Look for something positive in each day, even if some days you have to look a little harder.
If you never fail you will never figure out what you need to fix to make it work.

Not everything will go as you expect in your life... this is why you need to drop expectations, and go with the flow of life.
Keep calm and carry on. Don't let people bring you down. Focus on those who love you, forget the ones who don't.
The most important thing in your life is life itself nothing else matters. Once you die nobody will care about what you had or didn't have.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
Three things you cannot recover in life: the WORD after it‚Äôs said, the MOMENT after it‚Äôs missed and the TIME after it‚Äôs gone. Be Careful!
Life gives us choices. You either grab on with both hands and just go for it, or you sit on the sidelines.
Dreams are only dreams until you wake up and make them real.

Try to expect nothing, but be open for anything. Don't look for happiness, but don't settle for anything less
Nobody is perfect. So before u start judging, critizing or mocking, remember everybody is fighting their own war
Everyone comes into your life for a reason; some good, some bad. They shape, form and break us. But in the end make us who we are.
Sometimes the only blessing you need to count is your heartbeat.
A fake smile may fool the crowd but it never eases the pain.
Like the sunrise, some things just have to happen and all you can do is watch.
The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.
Don't be afraid of change. You may end up losing something good, but you will probably end up gaining something better.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
Always be thankful. Life could be worse.
No one is in control of your happiness except you.
This generation likes to share everything about their life. Some stuff is better left unsaid.
And now it's about time to get warmer 
Honesty is better than sugar coated bullshit.
Friday vibes <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
Some people will never change, and you have to accept that.
Loyalty shouldn't be as rare as people make it.
You will never be able to stop people from talking bad about you. You simply grow to react less and less.
The hurtful words you speak to people can be forgiven but they leave scars.
Sometimes silence says it all.
Whatever you decide to do make sure it makes you happy.
Be who you are and not who the world wants you to be.
Be strong now because things will get better. It might be stormy now, but it can't rain forever.
Create happiness if you can't find it.
There's nothing wrong with making a mistake, what's wrong is not make the effort to make it right.
Always wanting the best for someone, even if it doesnt include you. That's what true love is.
Be the type of person you'd want to meet.
No matter how much it hurts now, someday you will look back and realize your struggles changed your life for the better.
When life puts you in tough situations, don't say "Why me" say "Try me"
Don't compare your life to others, you have no idea what their journey is all about.
Don't change the way you are just to make somebody happy.
Remember, you can't reach what's in front of you until you let go of what's behind you.
Take a chance and you never know what might happen.
Just because someone isn't exactly what you're looking for, doesn't mean they're not exactly who you need.
The older you get the more you realize not to put too much energy in not important shit.

You will always be tempted and tested to take the easy way out
Sometimes the only way to fix the problem, is to just leave it alone.
One smile can't change the world, but your smile can make a difference to one person.
Your attitude is your outlook seen from the inside out.
Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you the best way they know how.

You really know you love someone when all you want is for them to be happy, even if that means that you are not a part of it.
There's a difference between giving up and moving on.
Losing is a learning experience. Strength does not come from winning at everything. Your greatest struggles develop your greatest strengths.
Problems are probably only problems for you now. But you will realize they helped you grow at the end.
Don't apologize, and then do it again.
Sometimes you gotta accept the fact that certain things will never go back to how they used to be.
Care less and you'll stress less.
God is more concerned about your heart than your performance. If your heart is right, your performance will eventually catch up.
Life may not always be the party you hoped for, but while you‚Äôre here you can still choose to dance.
Don't let your ears hear what your eyes didn't see, and don't let your mouth say what your heart doesn't feel.
Be selective in your battles. Sometimes peace is better than being right.
Allow yourself to be a beginner. No one starts off being excellent.
If I want you opinion I'll ask for your opinion.
Everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were
Never be afraid to fight for what you believe in
People don't realize how much time goes into being great
Life is all about learning from yesterday, living for today, and hoping for tomorrow.
Those who are heartless, once cared too much.
Don't change who you are for someone else, you deserve someone who appreciates you for you.

Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
The happiest people don't have the best of everything, they make the best of everything.
Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination. The best is yet to come.
Sometimes, change is what we need.
Learn to let go. That is the key to happiness.
Less talk, more action.

There are two types of pain in this world pain that hurts you, and pain that changes you.
There will always be a reason why you meet certain people. Either you need to change your life, or you‚Äôre the one that will change theirs.
Your past mistakes are made to guide you not define you.
There's always a reason to smile, you just have to find it.
Move on from your past and be done with it. Your bitterness won't change a thing. Stop stressing over it and let it go.
Appreciate what you have and let go of what you can‚Äôt change.
When you get knocked down, don't stay down. Get up to fight another day.
All good things are worth waiting for and worth fighting for.
A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor
You are the author of your story. If you're stuck on the same page, remember that at any moment, you have the power to write a new chapter.
Never lose hope. You never know what tomorrow may bring. There is always a chance to change and make things right.
Just be yourself. Never apologize for anything that makes you happy.
Sometimes you have to die a little on the inside first in order to be reborn and rise again as a stronger, smarter version of yourself.
You can't just wait around to wait for what might happen, you got to chase for what you really want in life.
A house doesn't become a home until love moves in.
I learned a lot about falling in love when I fell out of love. I learned a lot about being a friend when I was alone.
Sometimes the blessings are not in what he gives but in what he takes away.
You may not know what life is all about....but you should know that it is not all about you.
Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith.
Treat people like mirrors &amp; watch how you reflect in their eyes.
You don't always need to be good in everything
Each one of us has to step up to the plate. Let the odds decide our fate
our generation has lost the value of romance, the value of trust, the value of conversation, sadly small talk is the new deep
Bitterness is like drinking poison &amp; waiting for the other person to die.

SMALL changes can make a BIG difference.
No matter how much you love someone don't go against your values and your beliefs.
You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.
Look at your problems as problems &amp; they'll continue to hold you down. See them as blessings in disguise &amp; that's what they truly become.
In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
The happiest people don't have the best of everything, they make the best of everything.
Sometimes the eyes can say more than the mouth.
Always give without remembering &amp; always receive without forgetting.
You can't change the past, so focus on making a great future.
Stay true to yourself because there are very few people who will stay true to you.
Before you assume, try asking first.
If you are aware of your weaknesses and are constantly learning, your potential is virtually limitless.
Live your life without expectations because it's better to be surprised than it is to be disappointed.
The most difficult phase of life is not when no one understands you, It is when you don't understand yourself.
Time is a thief....it sneaks up on you and steals your youth.
Wanting and needing have two very different s meanings some people still seem to not figure that out.
People ask me why is it so hard to trust others. The real question is, why is it so hard for others to tell the truth.
Be strong enough to stand alone, be yourself enough to stand apart, but be wise enough to stand together when the time comes.
The only thing worse than not finding happiness is finding it and throwing it away.
Some dreams are so unreachable, but they are not too far away to reach. Sometimes it just takes longer then expected.
Find love with your heart, not with your eyes.

Trust your struggle
A valuable lesson that a traffic singal teaches us, every problem is like a red signal if you wait for some time it will trun green.
Don't make decisions when you're angry. Don't make promises when you're happy.
You will never truly understand something until it actually happens to you.
Sometimes, the thing you most want, doesn't happen. And sometimes, the thing you never expect to happen, does.
Love is sweet when it's new. But it is sweeter when it's true.
It is never too late to make things right.
Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually.
You can't fall if you don't climb, but there's no joy in living your whole life on the ground.
Everyone you meet has something to teach you.
Karma has no menu. You get served what you deserve.
People can't change the truth, but the truth can change people.
Be thankful for what you have today. Work hard for what you want tomorrow.

Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right.
SMALL changes can make a BIG difference.
Sometimes you need the bad things in life to appreciate the good ones.
The problem with peace is, sometimes you have to fight to keep it.
Most people are surprised to discover that the winds of change often bring with them a breath of fresh air.
If you never thank God after every smile, then why do you blame him for every tear...?
The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited or erased; it can only be accepted.
Being a person is a matter of birth. Being an adult is a matter of age. But being a loving, caring friend is a matter of choice.
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.
Sometimes, the hardest things to say are those that come straight from the heart.
Don't judge me until you know me. Don't underestimate me until you challenge me. And don't talk about me until you talk to me.
Life is too short to hide your feelings. Don't be afraid to say what you feel.
Instead of wishing you were someone else, be proud of who you are. You never know who has been looking at you wishing they were you.

Be patient good things take time.
Make your life your masterpiece.
The hardest decision is deciding whether to "walk away" or "try harder."
Knowledge is knowing what to say. Wisdom is knowing whether or not to say it.
Prayer should be the Key in the Morning, And The Lock at night!!
Sometimes, the thing you most want, doesn't happen. And sometimes, the thing you never expect to happen, does.
Love is sweet when it's new. But it is sweeter when it's true.
You can't fall if you don't climb, but there's no joy in living your whole life on the ground.

Saturday is stacked up with sports this wkd. Racks on racks on racks
Its a always darkest before the dawn
Today is new. Whatever happened yesterday should stay there, except for the lessons learned. Use those to move forward wisely &amp; confidently.
No one makes a lock without a key. That's why God won't give you problems without solutions.
Never settle for being someone's something when you know you can be someone's everything.
Instead of putting people down all of your life, inspire someone, change someone's life for the better, make someone smile.
If you are afraid of failure you don't deserve to be successful!
Once the game is over, the king &amp; the pawn go back in the same box.
Believe with all of your heart that you will do what you were made to do.

You have to go through the worst to get the best.
Just because someone is strong enough to handle pain, doesn't mean they deserve it.
What matters most is how you see yourself in the inside
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
"I promise", "I am sorry", and "I love you" all have eight letters, but then again, so does "bullshit".
Nobody ever wants to hear this, but sometimes the person you want most, is the person you're best without.
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
Relationship's like an onion which has many layers of TRUST and CARE. If you try to cut it, you will find nothing except tears in your eyes.
Never get tired of doing little things for people; sometimes those little things occupy the biggest part of their hearts.
Nobody is perfect, so instead of pointing out their flaws love them for who they are.
You don't have to be the best today, but be your best. It's a new day with new opportunities. Make it great.
People say u don't know what you've got until it's gone... truth is, you knew what you had, you just thought you'd never lose it.

Don't judge somebody just because they sin differently than you.
Learning to ignore certain people is one of the paths to inner peace. Life gets easier when you remove those who make it difficult.
There will always be a reason why you meet certain people. Either you need to change your life, or you‚Äôre the one that will change theirs.
Two things that define you are your patience when you have nothing, and your attitude when you have everything.
Positive thinking can change your life. Stop looking for reasons to be unhappy and think of all the reasons you have to be happy instead.
Decide what you want, believe you can have it, believe you deserve it, and believe it‚Äôs possible for you.
Happiness cannot be traveled to,owned, earned, or worn. It is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace &amp; gratitude
Three things you cannot recover in life: the WORD after it‚Äôs said, the MOMENT after it‚Äôs missed and the TIME after it‚Äôs gone. Be Careful!
The impossible can always be broken down into possibilities.
We can't control the wind but we can adjust the sails.
Too many people miss the silver lining because only watching for gold.
Every day may not be good, but there's something good in every day.

Pleasing people is hard work. Don't invest too much time in doing so, it will drain life out of you.
The quickest way to change the world is to change you.
Karma has no menu. You get served what you deserve.
When nails grow long, 
we cut the nails not fingers. 
Similarity when 
misunderstanding grow up, 
cut the ego, 
not your relationship.
Don't waste words on people who deserve your silence.
Be sure to taste your words before you spit them out.

Don't let your ears hear what your eyes didn't see, and don't let your mouth say what your heart doesn't feel.
I love God, and I'm proud to say that.
If you smoke, cool. If you drink, have at it. If you're not a virgin, it's not my business. That doesn't make you any less of a person.
Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool, a comedy for the rich, a tragedy for the poor.
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality.
Let your past make you better, not bitter.
Just remember that whatever you put up with, you end up with.
Don't get burned by the same flame twice.
When it's over, leave. Don't continue to water a dead flower.
You never know how important the small things are until your without it.
You can't go back and change the past, so look to the future and don't make the same mistake twice.
Our greatest glory does not consist of never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Success is the result of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.
The virtue lies in the struggle, not in the prize.
Believe with all of your heart that you will do what you were made to do. Live a life of purpose.
Sometimes being strong means not holding back the tears, but letting them fall.
A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.
Be thankful for today, because in one second, your entire life could change.
Sometimes, the hardest things to say are those that come straight from the heart.
Keep your expectations low and your hopes high.
Surround yourself with positive people who will support you when it rains, not just when it shines.
Every saint has a past. Every sinner has a future.
Treat everyone with politeness, even those who are rude to you - not because they are nice, but because you are.
Confidence comes not from always being right but from not fearing to be wrong.
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.
Knowledge is power. Never stop learning.
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude. Don't complain.
Don't judge a situation you've never been in.
Pain is only temporary but victory is forever.
To be happy you must learn to ignore many things.
Misused words make wars and heartache.
Sometimes you just need to wait and pray.
Never feel guilty recognizing your worth.
A lot of petty arguments happen bc people have too much pride to admit their mistakes.
This upcoming football season is going to be very interesting.
Don't depend on others to give you strength. Depend on yourself.
Blood makes you related, loyalty makes you family.
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
Not everyone is meant to be in your future. Some people are just passing through to teach you lessons in life.
An eye for an eye makes the world blind
Life is like a coin. You can spend it any way you wish, but you only spend it once.
Beauty doesn't last forever, but a beautiful personality does.
You never know how good you have it until you hear someone else's story.
Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you will start having positive results.
Don't cry over the past, it's gone. Don't stress about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it count.
Believe in yourself, there will come a day when others will have no choice but to believe with you.
Let your strengths overcome your weaknesses.
In life you'll realize that there is a purpose for every person you meet. Some will teach you, and some will bring out the best in you.
Learn to appreciate what you have, Before time forces you to appreciate what you had.
Keep Calm because Life's too short to stress over people who don't deserve to be an issue.
Enjoy the good moments. Stay positive in the bad. Know that everything will be alright.
You become what you believe.
Accept your past without regrets. Handle your present with confidence. Face your future without fear.
Spending today complaining about yesterday won't make tomorrow any better.
The harder the life, the stronger you'll become. The stronger you become, the easier the life will be.
Do what you love. Don't let anyone steal your happiness.
Don't waste your life trying to get back what was taken away.
The pain of discipline is far less than the pain of regret.
An ugly personality destroys a beautiful face
Never get satisfaction from someone else's pain and hurt.
Don't try to compare yourself to a pitbull if you are a golden retriever.

Times may get tough, but that's life. Dig in your heels, be determined to get past it, &amp; persevere. You'll be stronger &amp; wiser from it.
I refuse to be broken, unappreciated, used, or disrespected. I will handle myself in a way that no one can ever do those things to me.
Time won‚Äôt make you forget, it‚Äôll make you grow and understand things.
Some people won't love you no matter what you do and some people won't stop loving you no matter what you do. Go where the love is.
Always remember to be the woman you'd want your son to marry.
Confidence isn‚Äôt walking into a room thinking you‚Äôre better than everyone, it‚Äôs walking in not having to compare yourself to anyone at all.
Do not mock a pain that you haven‚Äôt endured.
Be patient with yourself. You are growing stronger every day. The weight of the world will become lighter.
Appreciate what you have and who you have, because the future can take it all away from you anytime.
your relationship should be a safe haven not a battlefield. the world is hard enough already.

You can't base your life on other people's expectations
Stand up to your obstacles &amp; do something about them. You will find that they haven't half the strength you think they have.
Losers are those whose words are bigger than actions. Winners are those whose actions are bigger than words.
Waiting for someone else to make you happy is the best way to be sad.
I'd rather stay quiet than explain my problems to people that don't really care.
Running away from your problems is a race you'll never win.
Sometimes sunshine turns to rain and the same ones you love bring you pain.
Happiness cannot be traveled to,owned, earned, or worn. It is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace &amp; gratitude
you don‚Äôt realize how poorly you‚Äôve been treated in the past until someone comes along and treats you the way you should be treated
No matter how many times I re watched the Gossip Girls episodes where Dan and Blair are together, I never like it or warm up to the thought
Why Pittsburgh why you going to release Keisel?
Everyone usually starts caring when its too late.
Sometimes you have to walk away from what you want to find what you deserve.
Loose lips sink ships
Stuck in a time where "loyalty" is just a tattoo, "love" is just a quote, "lying" is the new truth, and being "real" is just a drake line.
When trust is broken, sorry means nothing.
The Scariest Moment is always Just before you Start.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one single step.
Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool, a comedy for the rich, a tragedy for the poor.
Save your smiles for the people who deserve to see them. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
All it takes is one snowflake to start an avalanche.
Never forget who was with you from the start..
If you take care of Gods ppl, God will take care of you.
Your past was never a mistake if you learned from it.
Think before you act, because actions speaks louder than words.
You don't always need a plan, sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go, and see what happens.
Stand up for something, even if it means standing alone. Because often times, the one who flies solo has the strongest wings.
Learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue all that you want.
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.
If you keep running back to the person you need to walk away from, you'll never create space for better things to arrive.
Don't compare your life to others, you have no idea what their journey is all about.
Stop worrying about someone that isn't worried about you.
Good things come to those who believe, better things come to those who are patient, and the best things come to those who don't give up.
Don't say, just show. Don't talk, just act. Don't promise, just prove.
No regrets. Just lessons learned. <OK HAND SIGN>
Don't discourage yourself if you don't have it and someone else does bc their might be something you have and they don't.

Good things come when you least expect it.
This generation is not missing smarts, it's missing common sense. There is a difference.
Your actions do affect others
In life it's a game of keeping up or getting left behind
The only way to have a friend is to be one.
When you say yes to others, make sure you are not saying no to yourself.
Don't let the past steal your present.
Take time to appreciate what you have.
Don't change yourself for anyone.
Don't let someone who gave up on their dreams talk you out of yours.
Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.
You won't ever achieve anything great if you don't believe in yourself!
Give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.
Words mean little when actions are proving otherwise.
If your wish doesn't come true, God has something better in mind for you.
Life is good, life is great. Always love, never hate. Break the rules, stand apart. Ignore your head, follow your heart.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
WORRY looks around. REGRET looks back. FAITH looks forward.

Life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
Let things outta your control be.
I always knew looking back on the tears would make me laugh, but I never knew looking back on the laughs would make me cry.
Everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain, but you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.
Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.
Don't compare your life to others, you have no idea what their journey is all about.
Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?
Watch your habits, they become character and watch your character, it becomes your destiny.

No matter how good or bad the thing you have now, it won't last forever. Appreciate while you have it!
Don‚Äôt let the fear of failure stop you from trying something you have a passion for.
There comes a time when you have to choose between turning the page and closing the book.
Stop looking for reasons to be unhappy. Focus on the things you do have, and the reasons you should be happy.
Every struggle in your life has shaped you into the person you are today. Be thankful for the hard times, they can only make you stronger.
When you judge someone, you aren't defining them. You are defining yourself.
Never give up. Always find a reason to keep trying.
Trust because you are willing to accept the risk, not because it's safe or certain
Whenever you see a successful person you only see the public glories, never the private sacrifices to reach them
Opportunities don't happen, you create them
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will to succeed.
It is during our failures that we discover our true desire for success.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving forward.
Don't worry about what others think. People are always negative, don't let it bother you.
Life is full of fake people. Before you decide to judge them, make sure you're not one of them.
As we grow up, we realize it becomes less important to have a ton of friends, and more important to have real ones.
Learn from your past, move on, and grow stronger.
Loyalty is so hard to find these days. When you find it, don‚Äôt let go.
Always end the day with a positive thought. No matter how hard things were, tomorrow is a fresh opportunity to make it better.
The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone.
Sometimes life gives you the test before you've had time to learn the lesson.
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.
You don't always need a plan, sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go, and see what happens.
People will judge you no matter what you do... so you might as well do what you want.
Sometimes the bad things that happen in your life puts you directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to you.
We all deserve happiness.
Don't let a bad day make you feel like you have a bad life.

There's no reason to lie to me. I'm too understanding. I get shit. I get life. I know shit happens. I know when it's not that deep.
I'm feeling good for the Boston Redsox this season.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life; it goes on.
Don't ask God to make your life easier, ask him to make you a stronger person.
Until you spread your wings, you'll have no idea how far you can fly.
Never underestimate the power of a kind word or deed.
Remember that nobody makes it alone. Have a greatful heart and be quick to acknowledge those who help you.
A wise person knows that there is something to be learned from everyone.
Never give up on anybody, miracles happen everyday.
Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you'll ever regret.

Stars can't shine without darkness.
Just remember; Someone loves everything you hate about yourself.
Pain changes people.
You don't need a reason to help people.
It's hard to be positive when everyone, and the world around you is so negative.
No expectations, no disappointments.
Trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller and smaller after every mistake.
Each story has an ending.... But sometimes endings are just a new beginning.
Don't run from the lessons in life. Anything that hurts you has the ability to teach you.
When you stop chasing the wrong things you give the right things a chance to catch you.

True love is when you care about their happiness more than your own.
Everybody needs somebody sometimes.
Be there for others, but never leave yourself behind.
@JazzyFae02 miss seeing you do your thing and tear it up on the field. Legend in my books. Stud of a player!

Let people do what they need to do to make them happy. Mind your own business, and do what you need to do to make you happy.
If you live your life with the regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you will have no today to be thankful for.
Life is a journey, with problems to solve, lessons to learn, but most of all, experiences to enjoy.
Be kinder to yourself. And then let your kindness flood the world.
Be grateful for what you do have, not bitter for what you don't.
A broken heart loves better than one that has never been hurt.
You are beautiful because you let yourself feel, and that is a brave thing in deed.
People grow when they are loved well. If you want to help others heal, love them without an agenda.
I used to care about what people thought of me until the day I tried to pay my bills with their opinions.
We are born in one day. We die in one day. We can change in one day. And we can fall in love in one day. Anything can happen in just one day
Being strong doesn't mean you'll never get hurt. It means that even when you do get hurt, you'll never let it defeat you.
You have the biggest heart. It is your greatest quality and probably also your biggest flaw.
If you can't change the situation, learn to see it differently. If you can't change people, learn to understand them better.
Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have because we're too focused on what we want.
Nothing is more beautiful than a confident woman who doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something she‚Äôs not.
The smarter you get, the less you speak.
Always keep a piece of you for you. That's not selfish, that's survival.
Healing is a choice. It's not an easy one, bc it takes work to turn around your habits, but keep making the choice and shifts will happen.
You don‚Äôt have to accept things you are not okay with.
Some bridges are meant to be burned, because there‚Äôs certain things in your life you can‚Äôt afford to go back to.
Don‚Äôt let anyone drain you of your happiness today. Be drama free. Rise above the petty stuff.
If life can remove someone you never dreamed of losing, it can replace them with someone you never dreamt of having.
Be careful who you open up to. Only a few people actually care. The rest just want to have something to gossip about.
The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.
There's always some reason to be positive. Don't let a little negativity stop you from seeing all the good that's around.
I survived because the fire inside me burned brighter than the fire around me.
Time won‚Äôt make you forget, it‚Äôll make you grow and understand things.
People aren‚Äôt always going to be there for you, that‚Äôs why you learn to handle things on your own.
Some people won't love you no matter what you do and some people won't stop loving you no matter what you do. Go where the love is.
Just because someone doesn‚Äôt love you the way you want them to, doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt love you with all they have.
Happiness comes from pursing goals not necessarily achieving goals.
The beat is everywhere but every life has to find its own flow.
Choosing to embrace life by being present to what is brings the sweetest joy and most sublime awe.
Let go of the need to convince others. All you need is to believe in yourself.
Sometimes my greatest accomplishment is just keeping my mouth shut.
People try to limit your progress because they know that your progress will limit them.
There's beauty in simplicity.
Henderson!!! Are you pursuing your career in Tokyo? I have missed seeing the number 54 on the diamond @Jolenecal54
Stop making life so complicated and enjoy the ride.
Cherish every moment
Find what works for you, not what works for someone else.
@The hardest things in life are what make you the strongest.
The hardest thing in life is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn.
Trust is the hardest thing to find and the easiest thing to lose.
Strength does not come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't.
Be careful who you open up to. Only a few people actually care. The rest just want to have something to gossip about.
Worry about loving yourself, instead of loving the idea of other people loving you.
If you're helping someone and expecting something in return, you're doing business not kindness.
Be nice to people on your way up because you might meet them again on your way back down.
Time won‚Äôt make you forget, it‚Äôll make you grow and understand things.
People aren‚Äôt always going to be there for you, that‚Äôs why you learn to handle things on your own.
Mistake makes us human. Failure makes us stronger. Hope keeps us going. Love keeps us alive.
Everyone comes into your life for a reason; some good, some bad. They shape, form and break us. But in the end make us who we are.
Sometimes the only blessing you need to count is your heartbeat.
You block your dream when you allow your fear to grow bigger than your faith.
Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.
A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
Sometimes the decisions which seem hardest to make, are the ones that will eventually make us happiest.
Be thankful for all the struggles you go through. They make you stronger, wiser and humble. Don't let it break you let it make you.
Forgive others. Not necessarily because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
Trying and Doing are two different things. When you try, you hope. When you do, you succeed.
Everybody you fight is not your enemy, and everybody that helps you is not your friend.
When someone shows you their true colors, don't try to paint a different picture.
Never be afraid of change. You may lose something good, but you may gain something even better
Don't waste time on revenge. The people who hurt you will eventually face their own karma.
Smiling is the best way to face any problem, to crush every fear and to hide every pain.
Karma has no menu. You get served what you deserve.
Sometimes you just get tired of being the only one trying.
Don't judge my choices without understanding my reasons.
The two most important days in your life, are they day when you were born and the day you found out why.
Some things are better left unsaid.
Over-thinking is what kills you.
Sometimes, the hardest things to say are those that come straight from the heart.
Do not be bitter about your past. Just try your best to make your future better.
Never take the little things for granted. They mean so much more.
A good reputation is precious, but a good character is priceless.
Caring for someone else's feeling and life more than your own, shows the true meaning of love.
You spend more time and energy hating someone instead of loving and caring.
Life is never fair; you have to learn to ignore it.
Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and give thanks for all the troubles we don't have.
Before you ask why someone hates you, ask yourself why you even care.
Don't ever let someone play with your feelings, your emotions, and your heart.
Some people will never change, and you have to accept that.
Always say what you mean and mean what you say. Express how you feel and don't ever apologize for being real.
Everyone makes mistakes, nobody is perfect. Live it, learn from it, move on.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
Never blame anyone in your life. Good people bring you happiness, bad people bring you experience.
Your life is a result of your choices. If you don't like your life, it's time to make some better choices.
You cannot start the next chapter of your life if you keep rereading the last one.
When something bad happens, you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.
Never be afraid of change. You may lose something good, but you may gain something even better
Time decides who you meet in life, your heart decides who you want in your life and your actions decide who stays in your life.
You can apologize over and over, but if your actions don't change, the words become meaningless.
Sometimes it takes sadness to know happiness, noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence.
If you want everyone to respect you, you must first respect yourself. Its the very basic rule.
Whatever life gives you, even if it hurts, just be strong and act like you're okay. 
Strong walls shake, but never collapse.
Don't let yourself be controlled by these three things: your past, people, and money
The true mark of maturity is when somebody hurts you and you try to understand their situation instead of trying to hurt them back.
Don't mix bad words with a bad mood. You'll have many opportunities to change a mood, but you won't be able to replace words you spoke
You aren't wealthy until you have something money can't buy.
Be thankful for all the struggles you go through. They make you stronger, wiser and humble. Don't let it break you let it make you.
Sometimes the decisions which seem hardest to make, are the ones that will eventually make us happiest.
Forgive others. Not necessarily because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
People change. Feelings fade. Lovers drift. Friends leave. Friends become enemies. Lovers become strangers. You‚Äôll be judged. Life goes on.

If I ever lose something, I gain even more. See things through the positive angle
The truth is you don‚Äôt know what is going to happen tomorrow. Life is a crazy ride and nothing is guaranteed.
Its your road, and yours alone. others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for You.
No one in this world is pure &amp; perfect. If you avoid people for their little mistakes, you will always be alone. So judge less &amp; love more.
Don‚Äôt start your day with the broken pieces of yesterday. Every morning we wake up is the first day of the rest of our life.
We learn something from everyone who passes through our lives.. Some lessons are painful, some are painless.. but all are priceless.
Today will never come again. Be a blessing. Be a friend. Encourage someone. Take time to care. Let your words heal, and not wound.
Not in achievement, but in endurance, of the human soul, does it show its divine grandeur and its alliance with the infinite.
Courage is what you earn when you've been through the tough times &amp; you discover they aren't so tough after all.
Sometimes it's better to be kind than to be right. We do not always need an intelligent mind that speaks, just a patient heart that listens
Work your hardest. Think your smartest. Dream your biggest. Be your greatest. Love you fullest. Smile your brightest.
An attitude of "whatever is convenient" won't accomplish very much. An attitude of "whatever it takes" is impossible to stop.
To believe means to hope for the best, endure the stress, passing every test and accepting nothing less.
When we try to discover the best in others, we end up bringing out the best in ourselves.
Be strong when you are weak, brave when you are scared and humble when you are victorious.
Take a risk. If the outcome isn't what you expected, at least you can say you tried.

Never let anyone make you feel inferior. Never let anyone make you feel inferior. Never ever give up.
Be your own inspiration. Work for your dreams. Stay focused on your own life.
Remember happiness doesn‚Äôt depend upon who you are or what you have; it depends solely on what you think.
Our life isn't perfect, but it does have perfect moments.
All misfortune is but a stepping stone to fortune.
It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of someone else's life with perfection.
Never expect. Never assume. Never ask. Never demand. Just let it be, if it's meant to be... it will happen.
You will never truly understand something until it actually happens to you.
Sometimes you have to let go of something precious in order to get something priceless.
Never judge someone on their past because they are no longer at that stage in their life.
Sometimes the smallest things have the biggest meaning.
Don't treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.
Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove.
I've made lots of mistakes in my past...but if you judge me on what I did in my past, then you have no reason being in my future.
Be thankful for what you have. You have no idea how many people would love to have what you've got.
Being a person is a matter of birth. Being an adult is a matter of age. But being a loving, caring friend is a matter of choice.
Distance yourself from negativity and great things will happen.
Never be afraid to let go, because you may never know what greater things might replace the ones you have lost.
It doesn't matter what people think about you. It's what you think of yourself that really counts.
Some people come into your life as blessings. Others come into your life as lessons.
Be thankful for the bad things in life. They open your eyes to see the good things you weren't paying attention to before.

People expect the worse in everyone nowadays and they don't know how to react when someone is unconditionally nice and genuine to them
Spending time with people you care about is better than any material properties. Value the time you have on this Earth and spend it wisely.
Nothing is permanent in this crazy world, not even your mistakes, failures, and troubles.
Life doesn't have to be perfect to be beautiful.
Hate is only a form of love that hasn't found a way to express itself logically.
Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day, saying, 'I will try again tomorrow.
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. Take a leap of faith!
The surest way to lose sight of who you are is to constantly compare yourself to others.
Kites rise highest against the wind, not with it. You have to go through hard situations if you want to come out on top.
SMILE, It will make you look better. PRAY, it will keep you strong. LOVE, it will make you enjoy life.
You may look in the mirror and see flaws, but someone else can look at you and only see perfection.
Everybody wants the TRUTH but nobody wants to be HONEST.
Greatness lies not in being strong, but in the right using of strength.
Life's not about people who act true to your face. It's about people who remain true behind your back.
Give the world the best you have and the best will come back to you.
Happiness isn't a destination, it's a journey.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream...
Some people come into your life as a blessing. Some come as a lesson.
Some of the best things come when you least expect them.
You were born because you are going to be important to someone.
You were born an original, don't die a copy. Be Yourself!
The best proof of love is trust.
Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it.
Strive to be first: first to smile, first to compliment, and first to forgive.

Respect is earned. Honesty is appreciated. Trust is gained. Loyalty is returned.
When life gets hard, it makes you stronger.
In life, I have made a lot mistakes and I have felt a lot of pain, but mistakes make me smarter and pain makes me wiser.
Stop looking back on your mistakes. What's done is done. Learn from them and move on.
You won't have a positive life, if you have a negative mind. Change your perspective.
Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future.
To be happy, you can't be too concerned with others' opinions.
There are no mistakes in life, only lessons.
Never play with someone's feelings just because you're unsure of your own.
There's always a real reason behind every ""just wondering
Your life is not a problem to be solved but a gift to be opened.
Why worry? If you‚Äôve done the very best you can, worrying won‚Äôt make it any better.
In life your either a pilot or passenger. Your choice
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
Keep it simple. Keep it honest. Keep it real.
Stop swallowing your words, stop caring what others think. Stop waiting for the weekend, live now. Take risks.
I‚Äôm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you‚Äôre not in this world to live up to mine.
Happiness will never come to those who don't appreciate what they already have.

Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy.
You don't always get what you wish for, but you always get what you work for.
Don't be afraid to take an unfamiliar path, sometimes they're the ones that take you to the best places.
Be a witness, not a judge. Focus on yourself, not on others. Listen to your heart, not to the crowd.
Better to let someone walk away from you than all over you.
Tackle your struggles with faith and know that there is no limit to what you can accomplish.
Make sure you don‚Äôt start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don‚Äôt value you. Know your worth even if they don‚Äôt.
For once, just stop caring, and worry about yourself instead.
People are gonna label you, but it's how you overcome those labels that matters.
Trials in life are not meant to make us fail, but to see how far we can fly.
Sometimes you don‚Äôt realize your own strength until you come face to face with your greatest weakness.
Some people make your life better by walking into it, while other people will make your life better by walking out of it.
Silence and smile are two powerful tools. Smile is the way to solve many problems and silence is the way to avoid many problems.
Always say what you mean and mean what you say. Express how you feel and don't ever apologize for being real.
Life is too short to waste one single second with someone who doesn't appreciate and value you.
The greatest enemy of success is fear.
Sometimes you just get tired of being the only one trying.
Believing in yourself is the first secret of success.
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.
I'm never shocked when people let me down nowadays. I just hate the fact that i put myself in a position to be let down in the first place.
Wake up every morning with a smile on your face, go through the day with your head up and don't let words take you down.
Sometimes, the hardest things to say are those that come straight from the heart.

Not everything will go as you expect in your life... this is why you need to drop expectations, and go with the flow of life.
Keep calm and carry on. Don't let people bring you down. Focus on those who love you, forget the ones who don't.
The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited or erased; it can only be accepted.
I don't have time to worry about the people that don't like me. I'm too busy the people that love me.
Friends come in all shapes and sizes
Be patient. Good things come to those who wait.
Life gets better when you stop caring about what everyone thinks.
The worst thing that happens to you may be the best thing for you, if you don't let it get the best of you.

Be thankful for all the struggles you go through. They make you stronger, wiser and humble. Don't let it break you let it make you.
Accept what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.
Stop crying over yesterday and start smiling for tomorrow.
Of course it's hard. It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it. Hard is what makes it great.
A negative mind will never give you a positive life.
Your actions and your words should always agree with each other.
Every day do something that will inch you closer to a better tomorrow.
Surround yourself with positive people who will support you when it rains, not just when it shines.
Sometimes, we need to be hurt in order to grow. We must lose in order to gain. Sometimes, some lessons are learned best through pain.
Confidence is key.
When you finally get something good, enjoy it. Don't go looking for something better.

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.
Your past may be cloudy, but your future is sunny.
Forgive others. Not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.
Accept your past without regret, handle your present with confidence, and face your future without fear.
Smiling is the best way to face any problem, to crush every fear and to hide every pain.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
Don't let your happiness depend on other people.
Worrying doesn't stop the bad things from happening it stops you from enjoying the good things.
Sometimes it takes losing everything you have to finally grow and find yourself.
Never blame anyone in your life. Good people bring you happiness, bad people bring you experience.
Smile, because life is too short to be unhappy.
Work hard in silence; let success make the noise.
Don't cry over the past, it's gone. Don't stress about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it beautiful.
Never let yesterday use up too much of today.
You are your own problem. You are also your own solution.
Your life is a result of your choices. If you don't like your life, it's time to make some better choices.
You cannot start the next chapter of your life if you keep rereading the last one.
Every day you're blessed with new opportunities to get better. There's no reason that you shouldn't take advantage of those opportunities.
Wake up every day and be thankful. Every day is a gift, make the most of it and don't take it for granted.
Scars are stories, history written on the body.
Don't leave something permanent, for something temporary.
Every day holds the possibility of a miracle.
Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks for all the troubles we don't have. Life is a gift.
Never take your life for granted. Focus on all the positive and embrace it. Ignore the negative and be thankful for every single day.
People change. Feelings fade. Lovers drift. Friends leave. Friends become enemies. Lovers become strangers. You‚Äôll be judged. Life goes on.
Life is about trusting our feelings, taking chances finding happiness, appreciating the memories and learning from the past.
Don't let something that doesn't matter cause you to lose something that does.
You don't need a reason to help people.
Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't.
You will face bear many defeats throughout life, but never let yourself be defeated.
A person's true wealth is the good he or she does in the world.
Though you may be under a dark tree, always look for the light shining through the branches.
Sometimes, a poor past turns out to be the best investment in a promising future.
The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory.
God will not allow a trial to come into your life unless He has a purpose. He doesn't send the storms, but He uses them.
I believe that when we face challenges in life it's an opportunity to build on our faith, inner strength, &amp; courage.
Don't let the silly little dramas of each day get you down. You are here to do great things.
The possibilities are endless when you work hard and never give up.
The best things in life aren't things.
The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present.
Never look down on anybody unless you're helping them up.
Always believe in yourself, you are amazing just the way you are.
Learn to appreciate what you have, Before time forces you to appreciate what you had.
Keep Calm because Life's too short to stress over people who don't deserve to be an issue.
Enjoy the good moments. Stay positive in the bad. Know that everything will be alright.
Sometimes the only thing that people see is what you did when in fact they should be looking at why you did it.
Hope is the only thing stronger than fear.
Life has so many different chapters. One bad chapter does not mean it's the end of the book.
Before you assume, learn. Before you judge, understand. Before you hurt, feel. Before you say, think.
Action speaks louder than words. But there comes a time wherein words speaks clearer than actions.
Stop trying so hard for people who don't care.
Too many people are caught up someone else's life that they don't even have time to fix their lives.
One man could change the world
I hope you learn how to make it on your own and if you love yourself you will never be alone.

The meaning of life is to give life a meaning.
Nothing is more beautiful than a smile that has struggled through tears.
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.
The harder the life, the stronger you'll become. The stronger you become, the easier the life will be.
Spending today complaining about yesterday won't make tomorrow any better.
There's nothing wrong in making mistakes, what's wrong is letting it stay as a mistake without the effort of making it right.
You deserve to be happy. Don't let anyone make you forget that.
Every sunset gives us one day less to live but every sunrise gives us one more day to hope! So always hope for the best!
Don't go through life, grow through life.
Let your dreams be bigger than your fears, your actions louder than your words, and your faith stronger than your feelings.
A good life is when you smile often, dream big, laugh a lot and realize how blessed you are for what you have.
With courage you will dare to take risks, have the strength to be compassionate, and the wisdom to be humble. Courage leads to integrity.
A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.
Don't judge me until you know me. Don't underestimate me until you challenge me. And don't talk about me until you talk to me!
Never be upset that it didn't work out, be glad that you learned something to make you better for the next time.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Only you can change your life. No one can do it for you.
No act of kindness, no matter how small is ever wasted.
If you don't like something, change it; if you can't change it, change the way you think about it.
Either you run the day or the day runs you. Make your own fate and make today your best day.
The past is behind, learn from it. The future is ahead, prepare for it. The present is here, live it.
ALWAYS make a total effort, even when the odds are against you.
The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance, the wise man grows it under his feet.
Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.
Stay positive when negativity surrounds you. Smile when others frown.
Before you assume, learn. Before you judge, understand. Before you hurt, feel. Before you say, think.
Although not every choice you make is about directions, all choices will influence where you end up.
Learn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow.
In Life it's a trial and error experience
Don't compare your Chapter 1 to someone else's Chapter 20.
Positive thinking leads to a happier and healthier life.
When it comes time to let things go, it's hard and unexpected but in the end you learn it's better and worth it.
All it takes is one person to believe
You find that the rough times make you stronger.
Concentrate on your strengths instead of your weaknesses, on your powers instead of your problems.
Don't worry about what others think, This is YOUR life, live it the way you want to.
Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you will start having positive results.
Sometimes the memories are what keep us from moving on.
It doesn't matter where you've been, what matters is where you're going.
There's nothing wrong in making mistakes, what's wrong is letting it stay as a mistake without the effort of making it right.
Over thinking kills your happiness.
Don't count your days, make your days count.
Remember, what goes around comes around.
You have within you,right now,everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.
@ddlovato my thoughts and prayers are with you. Hope you get well soon <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> #GetWellSoonDemi

Mistake makes us human. Failure makes us stronger. Hope keeps us going. Love keeps us alive.
Sometimes the only blessing you need to count is your heartbeat.
People come. People go. They will drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite story.
If you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain.
GOD LOVES YOU MORE IN A MOMENT THAN ANYONE COULD IN A LIFE TIME
Good ppl are like candles, they burn themselves up to give other's light.
Be the best version of you
How do you explain something that you can't even explain yourself.
Only if you realized and saw how much I care for you.
Im here for a good time not a long time.
You get what you give
Bc sometimes when the moment comes to let go, I can't
I wish things were able to last forever
Life is short and unpredictable, don't waste another minute on the people, places and things that don't make you happy.
Being nice to those who are nice to you, that's Reality. Being nice to those who aren't nice to you, that's Maturity.
Have patience &amp; wait for the thing u want the most. Don't chase it. Don't run after it. If God wants you to have it He will give it to you.
Train your mind and heart to see the good in everything. There is always something to be grateful for.
Be grateful for what you do have, not bitter for what you don't.
People grow when they are loved well. If you want to help others heal, love them without an agenda.
Give people high fives just for getting out of bed. Being a person is hard sometimes.
Being strong doesn't mean you'll never get hurt. It means that even when you do get hurt, you'll never let it defeat you.
Such a disappointment when you defend someone for so long thinking they are different and they turn out to be just like what everyone said.
Falling in love with yourself first doesn‚Äôt make you vain or selfish, it makes you indestructible.
If u try to control everything &amp; then worry about the things u can't control, u are setting yourself up for a lifetime of frustration/misery
We are all a little broken. But last time I checked broken crayons still color the same.
It‚Äôs best to be honest, to make the most of what you have, to be happy with simple pleasures, and to have courage when things are difficult.
You will not get what you truly deserve if you're too attached to the things you're supposed to let go of.
If you can't change the situation, learn to see it differently. If you can't change people, learn to understand them better.
Change is the only thing in life that is constant.
Work hard and stay humble
@rickiiinichole best wishes to you and your family.
In the end, some of your greatest pains become your greatest strengths.
Appreciate effort, sometimes you just don't know what they had to go through just to keep you happy.
Open your mind before your mouth
Every day may not be good but there is always something good in every day.
Be the light in the dark, be the calm in the storm and be at peace while at war.
It is impossible to please everyone always.
Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you don't have to apologize when you do something wrong.
You don't have to learn how to control your thoughts; you just have to stop letting them control you.
A promise is a promise, at least that's what they say. Welcome to reality, they're broken everyday.
Wherever you go, no matter what the weather, always bring your own sunshine.
It takes less time to do a thing right, than it does to explain why you did it wrong.
Faith today is fuel for a better tomorrow.
The sun won't shine until you put the umbrella away.
Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth.
Do not waste life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.

Live a better life by controlling your stress. Control your stress by not worrying about things that you can't change.
Don't practice until you get it right. Practice until you can't get it wrong.
It's important to give it all you have while you have the chance.
Never settle for less than you deserve.
Learn to give more, and expect less. You'll be happier that way.
You have within you,right now,everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.
Good luck. Finish strong and stay solid. Stick to everything. Wish y'all the best RTR <BASEBALL>Ô∏è<COLLISION SYMBOL><ELEPHANT><WATER WAVE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è@demiDee8

If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude. Don't complain.
Follow your heart with no doubt. If it's right, you'll succeed. If it's wrong, you'll learn.
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak, but is also, what it takes to sit and listen.
Sometimes the only way to fix the problem, is to just leave it alone.
Never give up on anybody, miracles happen everyday.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.

It's crazy what ppl would do for money
My decisions may not be great. They might not even be good but they come from the heart just as they should.
You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him.
It is impossible to please everyone always.
Forget about all the reasons why something may not work. You only need to find one good reason why it will.
Good luck 2 the dynamic duo in their home opener this wkd. Stay solid like syrup n stick everything <HONEY POT><HORSE><PURPLE HEART><YELLOW HEART><BASEBALL>Ô∏è<COLLISION SYMBOL> @OthonTherese @stephhiggins19
Even the most beautiful mirror can be shattered by the smallest stone.
If egg is broken by outside force, life ends. If broken by inside force, life begins. Great things always begin from inside.
Can you hear those footsteps behind you? That's not me running after you. That's karma catching up to you.
Don't regret the past, just learn from it.
I can conquer the world with one hand, as long as Gods holding the other.
It takes a strong person to say sorry, and an ever stronger person to forgive.
Faith is the cure that heals all troubles. Without faith there is no hope and no love. Faith comes before hope, and before love.
Love means giving chances when there are no more chances left to give.
Why try to be someone you're not? Life is hard enough without adding impersonation to the skills required.
In response to those who say to stop dreaming and face reality, I say keep dreaming and make reality.
Move on, It is just a chapter in the past, but don't close the book, just turn the page.
If we shall take the good we find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping measures.
Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.
@DanaeHays pound it <FISTED HAND SIGN> congrats  on going yard at your home opener<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> good luck on your next games. Make some noise and do your thing RTR <ELEPHANT><WATER WAVE><BASEBALL>Ô∏è<COLLISION SYMBOL>
For all the times you make a mistake and shut a door, another one opens...you're just to busy looking at the closed door to notice.
Who cannot understand your silence, cannot understand your words.
The best helping hand that you will ever receive is the one at the end of your own arm.
Don't assume because I don't respect assumptions
Be strong and move on. It's time for you to be happy again.
Miracles happen to those that believe, if you believe in something with all your heart &amp; mind, you bring it to life.
Life does not always give you what you want, but if you look closely you will see that it gives what you need for growth.
The worst thing you can do, is to make life decisions while you are emotional, while your heart &amp; mind are in disagreement.
Peace begins within, if you are not peaceful inside, the world you see will become chaotic.

Count your blessings and be grateful.
Stop holding on to what hurts and start making room for what feels good.
Life is about changing for the better. If you have to let go of some people along the way, then you go right ahead.
You can't control the things that happen to you, but you can control the way you react to them.
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have.
I'm stronger because I had to be, smarter because of my mistakes, happier because of the sadness I've known, and wiser because I've learned.
Pain changes people.
Don't judge ppl, you don't know what kind of battle their facing.
Don't educate your children to be rich. So when the grow up, so when they grow up they will know the value of things and not the price.
The past cannot be changed, forgotten, edited or erased. It can only be accepted.
True prayer is the greatest gift anyone can give
What's attractive is when you can stay classy and be sexy all at the same time
Change is the only constant
With great power comes great responsibility
Late nights early mornings
@Krystal___01 I'm so sorry to hear about ur injury. I hope u get well soon n pray everything goes good for u on ur road to recovery
Mistakes are opportunities to grow and learn for your future
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a man's determination.
It is better to promote what you love than bash what you hate.
Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.
Anything under God's control is never out of control.
In the end we are all the same inside and out.
My goal is to die with memories and not regrets.
Don't lose a diamond while you chase glitter.
Midnight doesn't last forever. Every darkness turns into light
You can learn a lot from your mistakes after your done denying them.
Sometimes you just need someone to tell you that your not as bad as you think you are.
Everyone that you met knows something you don't
There is always a way to do the impossible
Some ppl just know which buttons to push to set me off
The best thing that I can ever do is try
Sometimes, good people make bad choices. It doesn't mean they are bad people, it means they're human.
Wisdom is learning to let go when you want to hang on. Courage is learning to hang on when you want to let go.
Sometimes you have to accept the truth and stop wasting time on the wrong people.
Never regret. Take it as a lesson learned and move on.
Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning
The reason why we hold on to something so tight is because we fear something so great won‚Äôt happen twice.
Over-thinking ruins you, ruins the situation, twists things around, makes you worry &amp; just makes everything much worse than it actually is.
You have to let go at some point to move forward
In life, you'll realize that there is a purpose for every person you meet. Some will teach you, and some will bring out the best in you
Always be yourself, the people that matter love you for you.
People will judge you no matter what you do... so you might as well do what you want.
Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing, some people are not even worth your words.
Everyone cares when it's too late
All good things must come to an end
No matter where I go I will always remember where I come from
Try everyday to be better then you were yesterday.
Respect is for those who deserve it, not for those who demand it.
Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.
Don't judge me until you know me. Don't underestimate me until you challenge me. And don't talk about me until you talk to me.
Take risks: if you win, you will be happy; if you lose, you will be wise.
Faith is having a positive attitude about what you can do and not worrying at all about what you can't do.
I don't regret the things i've done, i regret the things i didn't do when i had the chance to do it
Happiness isn't a destination, it's a journey.
A positive attitude gives you power over your circumstances instead of your circumstances having power over you.
Find a heart that will love you at your worst, and arms that will hold you at your weakest.
Stop dreaming, start living, stop thinking, start believing.
Life doesn't get easier, you just get stronger.
You got to hold on to what your feeling
Boston Redsox are predicted to win the AL east woo woo <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Everything is part of a plan
People fall in love in mysterious ways
It's okay to cry. Just keep going.
I fight through my bad days so that I can enjoy every good day more.
We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude.

Life is a math equation. In order to gain the most, you have to know how to convert the negatives into positives
You may not always end up where u thought u were going, but u'll always end up where u were meant to be
Truth hurts for a little while, but, lies hurt for a lifetime
