Nature, it's force - the scales unbalanced
What's the next step? How do we evolve?
Can we avoid a natural selection?
Can we avoid a natural selection?
Do we have the right to survive the failures?
Nature, it's force - the scales unbalanced
DUPERY
Approaching death
What you see is not me
But a dormant stage of what I'm expected to be
Realities lifeline cuts through me
At home we're bored 
Just got off another shitty tour 
Moat filled with flaming pus 
Sleazy - he won't talk to us
You think you have the answers...
To every last detail
In your eyes, you're the "victor"?
In mine, you've only failed
You think you have the answers...
Unleashed pain feed,
You fucking bleed
I kill once
So then I kill twice,
Revenge, your death,
The final ending released
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Frying, annihilating you
Or the shadows of the night
All the pain and suffering will dispirit or feed you, dispirit or feed you
The final massacre of people on the earth,
To raise their slaughter of mankind till its end,
Pain cracks their minds, everywhere is Death.
Far off on the horizon, you can barely see their torches
But rest assured, they're out there and they're coming
vielleicht sehen wir uns wieder irgentwann
It was the face that I loved
And I knew I had to run away
Get up!
Think fast!
Gonna be
A bloodbath
Cause you got one shot and you got one time
We don't need to
We don't need to
We don't need to
Ask your people
We'll stand together until the end of time
Our life belongs to Heavy Metal
Our fight applies to its enemies
Our hearts are as pure as the silence of a night
We are brothers of METAL united in fight
I don't believe in destiny, but I can feel luck
I don't believe in in people, cuz they don't give a fuck
Who died in vain for someone else's gain
I'm standing with the rank and file, I'm marching with the underground
Am I force to justify who I am?
Death
Sweet death could be a merciful fate
Delivered of despair
New kind of freedom
And I can rise
To my throne of
Overassessment
But I promise
Something is in my heart
But I promise
Something is in my heart
But I promise
Something is in my heart
Scabbed with the blood of ones they have killed
The ghosts of war must soldier on!
unveil the primal chaos within Thyself
daughter ov Anu slain, Lamashtu annihilate!
reveal to us overwhelming might
From hospitals to honesty and everything you need of me, I'll be there
A sound of death.
There's no one in the dark.
There's no one in the dark.
Thousand litres of blood.
Running every day.
Thousand souls.
There's no one in the dark.
There's no one in the dark.
Thousand litres of blood.
Running every day.
Thousand souls.
Sent away...
Can't wait much longer give them what they need
Burst down their heads spread hellish heat
Feel the endless pain
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind
Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
What can ever bloom again, when the power to live is missing, dryness sows hate inside of my heart.
Frenzied thoughts arrest my mind 
As I descend towards my imminent destruction 
The only thing I can rely on, when I lie even to myself
Why do my lungs still gasp, when I no longer breathe for you? 
Where is the truth in my existence
Hielt man schon mal es in der Hand 
Hier an seinem Strand 
Hier an seinem Strand
Peaceful 
Conflict resolution
Save it for another day, love.
Today we all die.
Until no one is left.
Or until the Calendar reads:
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
"I should have one last party at my place..."
You slut   
You whore   
Why are you my Mom?   
Fishfuck, baby   
Gonna fuck you with a fish (x2)
"The rich are rich because they're smarter than me..." 
You're taught this is right, 
that it's all your fault.
to make you blame yourself, 
"The rich are rich because they're smarter than me..."
Another empty soul
I see it in your face
You're just a snake in my way
 Get away from me
 Get the best of me
 Stop or slow down
I will break free
 From the walls that surround me
I'm sick of this feeling
Yes, we can continue to live in this delusion and the denials of reality because it's painful, it's frightening.
To hell if you don't believe
With power and pride
Eos crucem lacrimosa
Ave mater dolorosa
No regrets, but I still ask why
Take me away to a peace I've never known
This is the price I've paid
And it's take its toll
This one'll be black,
The death lies always in the sky,
The wolves i feed,
invoke the blessings of peace
Supply lines of the swarm ensuring
danger and harm
As the first wave diminishes,
Outweighed, policed and rationed
The wolfes i feed
Our liberties seized and blackened
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
The devil's own
Why?!
Where did I go wrong? Who was I supposed to be?
No matter what I've done, you've always criticized me
Fürchtet euch fürchtet euch nicht
Die Sonne scheint mir raus den Augen
Sie wird heute Nacht nicht untergehen
Eins
My cold touch is what you fear in the night
My breath is the path to the gate of your Hell
My power may steal your voice from a throat
I am...
I am...
I am...
I'm the Moonshield
That's when I reach for my revolver
The spirit passes by this way
Now that the sky is empty
The spirit passes by this way
Now that the sky is empty
Wait up, wait up, wait up for me
I'm living life, good god
I'm living life, good goddamn
I'm living life like a roman candle
The killers must be fed, the soil is red
Now that you're dead
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Stretching to the other side where it is sure to meet itself
Unearthly vacuum devouring the hourglass now empty
The heaviest of heavy sleepers
It's in the darkness and the guilt
And all the heartbreak blood I've spilt
Policeman takes his club to a head (It's unbelievable, whoa oh whoa oh-oh)
Scallop boat now baby
Scallop boat 
I.V. coke now baby
Funky scallop
Funky scallop boat
Down here in jail I do as I'm able
Another day in this carnival of souls
Another nights sets in, as quickly as it goes
The memories are shadows, ink on the page
Your God's long dead
So don't waste your time
On overzealous hypocrites
Who call chaos a crime
Eat the rich
Kill the poor
Worship always
Versiegelt wird die edle Haut
Bis sich des Unheils Welle staut
Und wir hoffen, dass die Welt sich ewig weiterdreht
It's blood red and torching every (new) horizon that it desires...
Látod most itt vagyok

Gyerünk mondjad!

Szemtől szembe, a baszott véleményed!
I am rage, becoming flesh 
A dismal, ravaged life 
This is pain: a wall of tears 
And my tears are my truest friends
In this darkness called my mind 
The waste you left for me
I'm your shit; your verbal smut 
Your twisted world, recapped
And tainted sky where angels cry - conspiracy of pain
The wolven screams of deepest hate - prophecies in blood
Breaking silence, falling rain
The time has come to die
Has come to die - die
Here the whispers in the wind
People all began to pray the boat began to toss,
A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.
They gave it to a man going way out west,
He'd better watch out too
Keeps getting in my light
I think he's going overload
These are not deeds of evil
But ways to own amusement
I am the god of slander
Mockery is my state of being
I give birth to the beasts
Look at the world, reflect the soul
And who will save us?
But where to go
To find the answers?
Insanity is made to stay
And no one ever cares...
We're going to Hell
But boy, I really don't care
Cause last night I met your mother, fucker
And I hope ya like to share, cause she did
Bleed do your wounds physical sins
Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E
We're coming on fast
You don't need to be afraid
Yeah, you deserve two minutes hate
Well we spit and we cursed
Above two silhouettes
Arms entwined like hissing snakes
Applaud the hound cremated
As blazing thirst slaked
A soul mate for the soulless
It burns like Venom
Lips back from teeth
In insolent rictus
Court of the skeletal king
Tiers of flame shed light
Set sickly faces to burn
Contort themselves against its glare
To the south and north,
Your spirit to your voice.
We stepped through into the earth,
And we walked to the river of witches.
The river flows two ways I saw,
To the Mountains
Cast the light - deadly trail
I see it now
Sky is lit - opens up
I want my share
Lift me up - carry me
I need you now
Heal the wounds - bloody deep
I have to stop
Ignite! To the Mountains
He harnessed the lightning for hire;
He drove the celestial team,
and Man was the Lord of the Earth.
He made him an hollow skin
From the heart of an holy tree,
Arise, O Man, in thy strength!
The kingdom is thine to inherit,
'Til the high Gods witness at length
that Man is the Lord of his Spirit.
He compassed the earth therein,
And Man was the Lord of the Sea.
He controlled the vigour of steam,
I ask him for mercy, do me no harm
But the bastard chops off both my arms
AGGGHH YOU JAPANESE BASTARDS!
Wooden leg, wooden leg, wooden leg
But the bastard chops off both my arms
AGGGHH YOU JAPANESE BASTARDS!
Wooden leg, wooden leg, wooden leg
I‘ve got a wooden leg, wooden leg
Too long we believed in those with no heart
Too long fake fools they had their say
Rivers infested - blood-bathed soil
sanguinary winds - cruelty blown
dacapitated pieces of foes
heads stacked - slaughetered as burnt
enraged servants or tyrant realm
genocide of all lands
The art of deception serves the prophet well.
I am no savior and I ain't no saint
They will take me to the electric chair
Yeah, Ha ha ha
No remorse and no regrets
But don't think I won't do it
Don’t you ever forget
If you want crazy
If you want fucking crazy
I'll show you how to be crazy
Fuck you!
But don't think I won't do it
Don’t you ever forget
If you want crazy
Rotten in the crypt is your next step
Friend with the maggots in your head
気付け人間エンピだ!風来坊
軍隊 戦場 歴史の闇の埋葬
誰もが叫んでる
I was born that way

Fuck it all
I took life lived it for myself
Me against the world every time
The fuel that burns is the anger inside.
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear
On behalf of water made to wine
What a relief, never bother the why's
Investing illusions and folding hands
The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies
All their precious pride is taken away
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear
american dream gone
mentally unfed
spiritually dead
Slumbering eyes their flares shall greet
Let the past cling on its futile self
And may the present rush for the future's glare
Recollection of the day
Delusions cast where dead trees sway
The sabre that separates
It's not my
I'm against the wall
I'm against the wall
But i will fight and i wont fall
Never keep me against the wall
Scorched field, the cleansing of the earth
Where are your gods?
Your dying prayers as futile as your faith
And to send your soul: to hell!
Burning corpses, the stench of flesh
Scorched field, the cleansing of the earth
Where are your gods?
As I scream out the message:
No hope, no fear - this is the end of all!
Hear the screams of lost souls
Hear them begging for mercy
A crack in the mirror, pictures split in two
I can't believe you slipped away
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face
You are falling into the squalls
Spirit fills itself with the tint of the teaching
Messengers of Namtar drink from your toxic well
Now that I have your heart by heart
Now that I have your voice by heart,
I glance more at your features being the Fourth
You are the distressing Shibbu and the worst of all
On sacramental grounds, feign as creatures of the Light

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Repeat 1st verse]

Deleted Weapons

My words of command are in the hands of Bane

My words of command are in the hands of Bane

Sein Radio spielt Country-Sound

Ich möcht' so gerne Slayer hör'n, Accept, und Judas Priest
Anyone can follow blindly,
 But it's up to you to rise above the masses,
 And chase your dreams,
 Because they will soon become reality.
I'm not your superhero
Pray for help, cry, I'll scream for you now
I'm not your superhero
They might show our scars
And hear us
But now we are
Awake enough to shatter what we hate
It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah
It's hard to start things over, oh yeah
The face before me flies
Sá lifnaðarháttur er ómögulegur

Líf þitt færi fyrir bý.
Sjáðu, fáðu vit.
the premonition of the beckoning end - the end
(Chorus) 
(Chorus)
peering through my heart now i know the consequences of my sins once before but
I adorn your white mane and tail. 
With the stars that fell from the sky.
For my heart and both of my eyes. 
The ravens of swift wings my sight. 
Surely now victory must be mine. 
Eight legged stallion of mine.
Images of origin long lost. 
I adorn your white mane and tail. 
With the stars that fell from the sky.
All the sins of the human race
You !
Carry all the secrets
Of a longtime evolution
But true knowledge will come
In the end when all is done
He's now the judge
I am defendant
Against a jury filled with death and it's slaves
Oh please forgive me
Turn on the lights and set me free
هل هذى صحيح
Perfect circles - Death-Aureole
Within - without - above - around
Ever searching spear of eyes
Beneath - below - between - behind
There's no one else

Love just isn't strong enough
I'm hoping that one day you'll finally see
There's no one else

I feel like I've been a fool
'Cause there's nothing like being used
Departed From My Mortal Host
My Inner Chaos Unleashed
I Watch From This Throne
Through Gates Of Untold Misery
Crucified In Fire And Gloom
Hell yeah, they fucking suck
Als sie endlich erwachen,
war es schon finstere Nacht.
Finstere Nacht...
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
worms in your entrails
prey upon the melted embryo
corroded brain and skin
your son died for your sin
rotting fetus in your womb
your own body is his tomb
mucous little brat
drowned in clothing blood
disgusting gastric juice
Funeral rites
You are chosen by Hell
Dig your sepulchre
Rotting corpses mutilated over the ground
Graves will be violated
And corpses will be stolen
Funeral rites
Obey, discipline, fear
Facing the end of moral ideals
I come to reclaim
The whole planet and its kingdoms
When death takes its dominion
When death takes its dominion through hate
This outline is according to a thought I imagined you to have
Violated and arranged
Disfigured and on display
In the shape of an ornament
We make it last 
A hated mass 
No solution 
Mind pollution
This land of fools will rise 
No good 
For no one 
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
No stand
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals 
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
Living, breathing 
Violence in your city 
If one man
He wouldn't be saved from hell 
He dwells 
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells
Race, pride, prejudice 
Black man, white man
Religion, violent innocence, guilt, panic
Exposed to all - A false reality
Look all through society...
More locks than keys
Peace means to reload a gun
Rest, I won't before I die
Nails in my brain, all that's left...just
Nails in my brain, nails hurt
Religion, violent innocence, guilt, panic
Exposed to all - A false reality
Look all through society...
Enthralled by a man who's come to save us,
Aforethought economic fall,
Yet the day we stand and hold our ground,
Vanity divine, ignorance confines,
Perception; a mortal flaw!
Imperial ecstasy is erasing my mind
Inventory of evil, a reflection of mankind
Those who disagree will disappear
Havoc and haze
Bleeding restless 'til the last days
Detector, soul collector
Detector, detector of sin
As if hinting to me
To choose day over night
To leave all of this dark
And seek the warmth of the light
And nitty-gritty, dirty little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong in all the right ways
It's so on right now
Party crasher, panty snatcha'
Call me up if you are gangsta'
Don't be fancy, just get dance-y
Why so serious?
Bedlam - Mansions of misery,
Built on pain - Your houses of deceit
Wake up, you fucking coward of a man
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
You carry the burden as an excuse,
To keep the pressure on so you don't fall off...
The lonesome star has faded far... into the grave of cosmic storms.
The dying rays of silver light... all form the sign of Satan's rise.
Falling dead star, crushing God's throne, spinning heavens, death reigns as king
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Just tryin' to make His way home
Just like a holy rolling stone
There is something yet complete
I don't know the name I don't know
And it seems to be always existing
The sun erupts in million blisters
Wild spirits roaming free
As the mighty forest starts to whisper
There is something yet complete
The Bastard Is Ripe For The Bleeding
Crucified, The Profit Is Vanquished
Killing Of The Newborn King
Justified By Those Who Compel
Obliterated From The Past
Fire, Destruction Now There's No Turning Back
Show 'em No Love
The Bastard Is Ripe And Fit For The Bleeding
There's pain within, 
I can't define
Inside, within, inside, 
illhealthy I feel
When your inmost yields
and you fall
illhealthy I feel
When your inmost yields
and you fall
...no nothing...
...all ending...
Sleeping well in my killing bed
staring blind around - 
Am I slipping away?
The wasted days
The chance for revenge
No time to waste
This is the time for revenge
Your claim to fame
Of crushing dreams
Your control has no hold on me
Heaven kicked you out
Heaven kicked you out
Breaking up for what you never have
Loosing everything all things you ever had
Going nowhere
Shadows all around.
All sight is lost.
This thick obstruction, yet limitless is the gaze.
Grey stares, watching while climbed, collapse!
This thick obstruction, yet limitless is the gaze.
Grey stares, watching while climbed, collapse!
Mina barn!

Medan regnet föll svalt,
ekade en förtvivlans sång,
över en fallen fader.
Sorg blev snart till vrede

Fångad i elden,
No way out
Cuts, blows and taunts
They bound a soul, my wolf brother

My wolf brother... Brother in blood
Could not see clearly

Fumbled among thoughts
My soul pursued
My brother-half compelled
Heard the children of the night
These are the words that go unspoken
Hiding the lies that we have chosen
We came undone
We came undone
These are the words that go unspoken
Hiding the lies that we have chosen
We came undone
Used to be king now considered a fool
I admire your burnt skin
But is your flesh rotten right through?
Alive among the lifeless
Ey guck, Schandenschmuck
Weil wir die Kinder der Schande sind
Ey guck, ein Schandenkind (x2)
Now revealed
Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past
Leaking membrane, consuming bodies
Now revealed
Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past
Iske, iske!
Iske! Kolme rautaa iskekäähän

Iskemällä sinä synnyt
Iske rauta, musta rauta
Kuuman tervan polttorauta
Iske, iske!
Cut-thoat, cut-throat
Cut-throat
You promise this and promise that
Deep inside, nothin' at all
In a war of filth and greed
Point of no return
Fears and dreams disguise
Lifes noose
Can I
Face the chair
Face the chair
Boil to unknown sights
Make believe broken dreams
Broken dreams

Boiling point
What no shame
Deep inside the dying woods
My destiny became reality
When the darkest shadow rules the world
Silent time once so full of love
The burning flames that rise will be
My endless pain before my way
Tears in my eyes - reflecting the shining...
Storming rain from deepest skies
Dreaming moon in the dark
Moonchild cries about the world
Ending the breath of life
Another season gone
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Smashed against the wall
I can see that you don't get it
It eats you alive if you let it
That's what I've done
Straight ahead
Full throttle
Crackdown at sundown
What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law 
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
Chaos forming
Vulture culture
Total rapture
Killing kingdom
Now has come
We stray the path intended further from the gates
We play with fire and we're always getting burned
The creation sons will pay one by one
They'll all come to you when I'm done
For no sin is left unjudged
Their suffering will be unleashed
Stay away from him girl
C-c-c-cold hearted uh, ah, ah
Oh oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool, no 
 
It was only late last night 
He was out there sneakin'
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name
Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Chase the water racing from the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
Under a glass moon light
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name
Outside the soundness of your mind
Batter this nation; batter its heart.
Just like an usurped town, to another due,
To the grave
Take this oath
Let us forsake
Forsake all the things
That lead us
Lead us to our demise
Open your eyes
See the divine
Open your eyes and see the
But I can see the fire's still alight
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There, burning into the night
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
They froze my blood and changed my soul
The master has spoken, the truth, not any lies
The Devil gives and evil takes
Still the wind was blowing soft
And gentle here under the oak
Which gave me shelter and rest infor my trial
I'm not strong, weak is my mind
A throne in hell, a price or a sacrifice ?
Still the wind was blowing soft
The bones of children
Adorn her (naked) breast
Fire flies illuminate
(Her) tangled goddess mane
Rat witch, fire and flesh
Rat witch, my soul is possessed

The bones of children
Green eyes reflecting the Hell I know, Hell I know

She appears in front of me
Upon all fours smothered scent
Burning sin
Fear not the Jaws that devour soul
Between two pillars I have sat
12 stars circle your brow
But you do not see them and the rain pours down
Our time in this garden is past
Through the dark night and the rain pours down
You are a daughter of heaven
12 stars circle your brow
I will lead this beast on a chain of flowers
Fear not the Jaws that devour soul
Between two pillars I have sat
Great oxen in the periphery
Our time in this garden is past
Lillith puts him to her breast
And holds him in delight
Raised in hell-raised in hell
Raised in hell-raised in hell
Dying at the witching hour
A virgins soul for me
Minds of Magic conjugate
Like greedy dogs we're waiting for you to set us free
Epiphany
Won't you come...
You never say never to a challenge
That will come along the way
There's no risk that you're not taking
There's no risk that you're not taking
Not a mountain that's too high
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it
To the best time of your life
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
I confront my enemy
Destroy them all

Fools believe that maithuna leads to Brahman
You are not the body that you depend on
She stood several blasts, she had twenty-seven masts
And they called her the Irish Rover
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
Taking a chance
Deafening volume 
In power and black
Light up skies in 
An aural attack
The darkest realm..yeah
A giant grows more every day
And now the maniac is here to stay
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue
And now the maniac lives inside of you
(CHORUS)
He's back. The suicidal maniac
Mörkret tar äntligen vid

Med ansiktet I ett vridet grin
I feel you as you fall away
This is my last serenade
From yourself you can't run away
It's your choice, point the finger
Hear them call you, dying for love.
Those who know you, dying for love,
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners
Stand in line, take our time and be proud.
Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left it's humanity
Our final cause is yours.
An indefinite statement of time.
I have been one acquainted with the night.
Dark ends darkness; man ends mankind.
No, there is no dawn.
Percus ! Forest spells and damned souls
Percus ! I find worship in you
PERCUS !!!
They will return, dance like fire, as before
they found peace and consolation.
I rediscover the power and charm
to defeat like a sorcerer,
like thousands years ago,
Battle Born
I'm Battle Born
Once upon a time I had an open point of view
But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
now evil in your brain
bullets left the gun straight ahead
awaiting your cancerous breath
will touch you when you're still alive
and left you when you're dead
creeping and crawing why do you cry?
pathetically prayers by your side
caught beneath my blood erection
creeping and crawing why do you cry?
pathetically prayers by your side
caught beneath my blood erection
lead injection
pollution guarantee
creping and crawling why do you cry?
pathetically prayers by your side
caught beneath my blood erection
The sky and the earth are now tainted by 
Blood 
Death is to blame for this enormous 
Flood 
The bodies are bursting apart
The captive angel
Flailing still
My carnal intention
Unfolds before your very eyes
The night is cold and clear
I cast my gaze to see
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes,
Lead us, Shadowchild - the truth's lying far from your life,
Shadowside - reflecting the eyes...
Doch erloschen ist mein Tatendrang
Ich will heim!
Ich vermisse meine Hölle
Die Menschheit is ja echt ne Qual
Die Jacke brennt es leuchtet weit!
Es brennt die Hand es brennt das Haar!
while clouds like cotton snowwhite sheep
still calm beside their shepherd sleep
Left to rot
Growing breach of faith
Left to rot with hate
I can't escape from this living hell
But in my dreams the justice dwells
Betrayers are torn apart
And my hate will fade away with their blood
My hate runs deep
In the waters of grudge and unforgiveness
Hilmar, Hilmar,
kaldan ná.
 
Kuldi nístir kinnar,

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead

Space! Trust your friends, just your friends!
To mankind it's fed
And deeper and deeper we fall
Chorus
Now look at what you've done
Created such a stir
If only you had kept yourself
You might have known for sure
Proof of life in outer space
Clouds in the sky
Away is the sun
The nightmare will come
The moon is shining bright
It's the only light
My legions will fly
Fly for the night
No, this is letting go
It's All For Real
Live Your Life
Not The Way They Taught You
Do What You Feel !
Survive The Jungle
Give Me Blood
( I Said )
Attitude And Respect
I know you are still here somewhere
 But I don't want to find you
 Even if you'd like to forget
I wondered who they're waiting for
 Until one day I understood
 You said every soul needs a home
 This is not a boneyard
Durch mein Kinderzimmer dröhnten Heavy-Metal-Kassetten von den Hausbesetzerfreunden meiner Eltern
Und heute erlebe ich ein Déjà-vu, ich seh's nicht ein, mich als Teil einer Szene zu fühlen
Hand me the bonesaw
Begin the amputation
Dying slow and painfully
A gasping breath escapes from you
I rip the flesh and cut through bone
A gasping breath escapes from you
I rip the flesh and cut through bone
You are bleeding
Sawed your body parts away
Waiting for the moment to strike
Take possession, take all your part
Turn your part into a farce
No respect, without regret
To give in
No way
This silence is false
V is very, very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore can
Awakened from an ancient slumber
The immortal ones return
From beyond enter the horror
Of a dark and hideous nature
The fall of man is now at hand
Awakened from an ancient slumber
Signs came in mysterious ways
Whispers from the wind - forget all about it
Clouds in the sky showed the way - fall into oblivion
No, I dont think so
Cannot escape me
No sound reason
Way back when
I wonder why they still hang around
I wonder where all these good things could be
Then I realize that somehow I found them in me
We should live by your laws
You folks can't feel that fear
You can walk the streets today
Dead religion, dead religion, die
I spit on the shit you prophesize
Your apocalypse, a pack of lies
Each generation says their time has come
The walls are coming closer 
Strangulating fear 
My mind imprisoned 
And screaming for the end
Naught nowhere and never
I will shine as he shone
Must go how he has gone
EQUINOX
Fotrh from you and darksome cell
From deep abyss of hell
Was treibt dich an wo ist dein Wille weißt Du was Du wirklich fühlst
The pentagramic rule
Falling from grace
'Cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind
With my lonesome song
Now I'm lost
Falling from grace
Supports their methods of abuse on the third world scene
And in your very own backyard, yes your country
Because the goods I own, aren't going to set me free
So I won't buy that crap, they want to sell me
revelate my eternal prayer
Unite to fight 
Unite to fight 
Radical resistance now! 
People from the east 
People from the west 
Everywhere under the sun
Was hab ich mir nur angetan
Was hab ich mir nur angetan
Will schreien, doch in mir kein Ton erklingt
Will weinen, keine Träne rinnt
War feige, hatte keinen Mut
Will schreien, doch in mir kein Ton erklingt
Will weinen, keine Träne rinnt
In mir die ganze Welt ertrinkt
Will schreien, doch in mir kein Ton erklingt
A painted smile, a glass - eye high on two that can't cry.
Touch me, I'm cold to the merits of (real) love.
Dicing up worms and making love to roadkill
The decadence of you lives was just as clear as glass
Crying tears of confusion
Crying for they don't understand
Crying because their young lives
Will be taken by their creator's
Hands
Surface of earth - covered in rime
Universal chaos in the realm of time
Surface of earth - covered in rime
From beyond enter the horror
from deadhousesmiles to scissorsmills
filthfinger's takin' / triggin' the kills
filthfinger's takin' 
be it this astrosonic brew
Resist (and question) 
Separation from the faceless majority 
Step on the outside
Look on the inside 
Tear, tear it apart
Trainfire, trainfire, trainfire...
So, you called my name
May all the other colors of your name
...go.
Left on a weary road beyond your ways
May all the other colors of your name
...go.
and every night is a celebration
you don't like to take straight shots
shut the fuck we only take straight shots
one more shot
we're going hard cause we run this shit
so stay the fuck at home if you party like a bitch
(if you party like a bitch)
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire...
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
Burning, burning with desire…
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire 
Burning, burning with desire 
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
We have an alibi to always get thru
Me and myself
My mentor and guide
You're my tormentor
Always by my side
Through this eralisation you gain Immortality 
Throught this attainment you'll realise that you are everything 
Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma
So there is no better time
Who will be born today
A gypsy child at day break
A king for a day
Out of the shadows and into the sun
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you
But we must endure it to live again
Dusty dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new your life's adrift
The neovitruvian man
Resurrection
This is my golden sum
I see with my third eye
I transform into fourth destiny
My number raises one degree higher
Pure freedom of my soul
I faded to the ground like so many times before
The way that he looked at her told me everything
I knew that he knew that we all could see
But I was the lunatic in the eyes of the world
No one listened to the weak mans poetry
Burning selfdestructive torture
Twisted thoughts drown determination
Just try and stop me, you can't control
Black eyes, we point together
Came from my past so I couldn't defy it
Changing my looks so I couldn't deny it
Oh this is a new day
Where were you, mother
Where were you all that knew the truth
No more keeper of the inside
In the water she felt no pain
Where were the ones who should have loved
Deaf ears surrounded
On the other side of society, the promised morning never came
In the outskirts of the real world, dream got lost
Where were you, mother
Where were you all that knew the truth
Betrayal was all around her
No one seemed to be aware
Where were you, lover
Where were the ones who should have deeply cared
Pain and fear surrounded
So alone and always scared
Where were you, father
Where were you, poet
Where were the ones who should have loved
Deaf ears surrounded
Nobody heard a single sound
Pain and fear surrounded
So alone and always scared
Where were you, father
Where were you all that could have made it end
From the seekers of the grind denial
She approaches to the water
The dark, cold water
She was a keeper of the inside
Leaving some words, a note
If anyone gave a damn
Gone for days, Julia
Without a trace, Julia
She was a keeper of the inside
(Revealed) by this place which is unfound
Without a trace, Julia
Leaving some words, a note
If anyone gave a damn
She laid her eyes upon the glade
A place unseen by many
Lay a razor in the hands of a broken heart
Don't tell the tales that tells it all
The walls are closing in, creeping closer and closer
Held down into loneliness
So beautiful but filled up with the tears and pain
That tonight you'll be left alone
Forced into darkness by the fear of failing
Held down into loneliness
Crawling back with dignity
Came from my past so I couldn't defy it
Changing my looks so I couldn't deny it
Twisted thoughts drown determination
Just try and stop me, you can't control
Black eyes, we point together
Changing my looks so I couldn't deny it
And the wings of the magpie swept her breath away
She was left to this decision alone
Misguided in the careless crusade
She kneeled for death in silence
No answers will be found and the black lodge still remains
From underneath the surface
In the water she felt no pain
Waiting for that moment again in this misplaced childhood
Ready to faint she will accept it, clutching at the tears in her mind
You have the same ability to do as them
Don't count your mistakes, get in the line and do what it takes
This day it will be the same way
The nights are long when you are scared and alone
The restless on their promenades are staring at your misery
The smile of the beggar, as you try to hide from his greasy eyes
When you are lost in your own escape
You wish upon another star and the tears starts falling
So you do it once again to ease your sorrow
In this corrupted pyramid
All for the one, the one for no one
The missing pieces in these fractured lives
This is the easy path, the way for the weak
But their pride remains unstained
In convoys crawling with cemetery smiles
The creatures in this freakshow are standing in line
Stabbing, raping, tear them into pieces
Screaming, crying, (just) deny it
Hide your senses
I'm waking up in an embrace of red
Undiscovered beauty, the blind men kill another one
And the magpie never used its wings to fly
In the sequence of a shaded kiss
The fearless uniformed got his tears on the inside
The art of the mourning kind
Beware of the denying, it's in your hall
You have the same ability to do as them
Holding hands with the seekers of the path
A forced face from the lingering hate
A fake grace for the closing eyes in the crowd
You just want the rest and the sleep
Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
I hear your cry into the night
I hear you die within my fright
But now you've saved your mistake
Angel Of Mercy…
what was said, what was done, 
I'd never wish this shit on anyone,
We’re gonna fall away and burn this to the ground,
Putrifacated acts still stop the future
With that progress in mind we feed on the feeble
Witness the destroyer
Beloved horrifier
The harbinger of our demise
Abomination we adore it
No one can be saved
Witness the destroyer
Beloved horrifier
The harbinger of our demise
Abomination we adore it
We raise our flag.
Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control.
(Hey!)
Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
save your soul from hell
to keep a place in paradise
when you die in vain
you blow your god in heaven,
so that he'll take you higher
Born religiously
truth is what they see
death won't come from peace
who fuels this war?
Sacred ground of life
death won't come from peace
Reason in me rings hollow
Truth is dissonant in salvation's lullaby
This is a nymn of self denial
Oh god please help us, get her out of this
Oh god 
Oh god 
Oh god
And anytime you need a shoulder, I'm right here
You've just gotta find a way.
She sits alone, tries to adjust
I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
Leads attached to twitching skin
Ignite the squirming foetus
To dissolve it from within
Ich bin du, du bist Ich
Ich bin Mensch erkennst du mich,
Ich bin du, du bist ich
Ich bin Mensch erkennst du mich

Ich bin du, du bist Ich
Ich bin du, du bist ich
Ich bin Mensch erkennst du mich

Ich bin du, du bist Ich
There's a light at the end
You better go right now
For the sake of all the keys that were left for something
Oh, this world
A fading memory that lost

I redefine this life of pain

Everthing that I believe in
The never ending light
The brightest star in the sky
Ignorant to the blind.
Shine us your light
Oh mighty morningstar
Hail Lucifer!
Civilians carbonized and black
Two hundred thousand
Burned, charred, and boiled
Deformed carcasses
Annihilation from the heavens
Damnation falls on the city
Sirens warning
Vielleicht das letzte Mal, dass ich dies sehe
Es ist kühl hier draußen bei den Eichen
Der Abendwind trocknet meine nasse Haut
Morgen wird unser Blut den Boden tränken
Meine Unschuld vom Blut der Feinde fortgewaschen
Ihre Todesschreie töten einen Teil von mir
Bis nur noch blieb, was ich jetzt bin...
Vi klöser
Vi klättrar
Vi klänger oss fast
Trust, in my instincts
Breathe, when I'm drowning
Of alarms in your life
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
Hold your breath afraid
Grasp the rope in fear
Grip just slips away
You yell but no one hears...
The day will come you will burn in a fire of requital
You will bleed for your dreadful actions
Fuck it all!
"Wär', wär', wär' ich doch zu haus geblieben!"
Für Ewigkeit bleibt keine Zeit 
Für Ewigkeit bleibt keine Zeit
Days of rage
Days of rage
Lies destroy life
Days of rage
Lies destroy life
O vers! noirs compagnons sans oreille et sans yeux,
Voyez venir à vous un mort libre et joyeux;
Et dormir dans l'oubli comme un requin dans l'onde.
Et dormir dans l'oubli comme un requin dans l'onde.
Je hais les testaments et je hais les tombeaux;
SELFISHNESS IS THE OPTION
DEATH OF THOUSANDS
WON'T STOP THE HARVEST OF MANKIND
DEATH OF MILLIONS
WON'T MAKE US BRIGHTER IN OUR MIND
WON'T MAKE US BRIGHTER IN OUR MIND
SELFISHNESS IS OUR POISON

I have wrapped myself with anger
And pursued you, killing without pity... I do
I've armed myself with all the strength of hell
I always move like a thief in the night
When I move in on you
As I murder you
Power out of Satan dwells has burned out the walls
Metallic crucifixion - the Devil speaks to me
Die Zukunft wird aus Mut gemacht
Ohne Angst auf Kollision
Unmöglich heißt die Mission
Bis jemand den Stecker zieht
Unter Strom
Seas of this continent so cold and invincible
A perfect platform to grow against the seasons
The snowbelts of Antarctica rise
With its dark polar winterstorms
Behind the gates and mighty portals
Of the arctic polar circle
Builds the frozen layers of snow
With giant iceesheets contantly on the move
Floating nearer with its tide and icy waves
The shadow of Antarctica spreads
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
Another day, a little dirt for the grave
Then you wake
Another body bag, pathetic,
Picture frame obituary faded in the attic
A shadow of someone you used to be
Remember the times that we had
The depths are forgotten now
Forget your past
I remember happiness
I see the evil in your eyes
I've seen the beauty in a modern world, destruction
you took the call, you took the fight
i'm finished here, i'm on to the next
this time, this time, this time, this time, you call
i know it's cheating baby,
but i know i have a right
With strength from above 
STEEL MEETS STEEL 
On towards victory we march, the guiding star
Not caring what she wished for, 'cause in the end, she wanted it all
 What you see is never
 What you get
I spread my wings again
Is what you wish to sell
There is no heaven without a hell
Penniless from their generosity
Sharing their money to quench your greed
Even when hope is in vain
There's no choice, for strength and honour
Is accompanied by pain
Hunt them down 
Back on to the shore
The wind blows cold
When night descends
Predicting war
At the edge of the world
In the shadow of the empire
would help, but I'm sorry. Jesus Christ. They nailed you alive. I tore you
care? I just hated the idea of having no share. My stomach ached for some
Now the first light of dawn
Lets us dream once again
To dead barren rock
Up on the mountain
They'll shed a tear
Then they'll pull the knife
They'll kill the one
Who's in their way
Impending doom is here to stay
Watch the city lights
U ain't shit until you learn how to rock!!!
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Now you bow down in the city of the dead...

I'm talking terminate
Destroy this fucking place
I'm talking full of hate
Wreaking havoc on my perfect world
They are the tricking trolls
They've got the bell that tolls
I see it
And you can't bring me down
So I won't be the consumer that they want me to be
They'll face our hell 
Ruins come round, these pawns will turn the tide 
Bleed away 
I recognize where the allegiance lies
The gateways are closed for me to seek
A lamentation I sigh
Again and again
Spiritual eclipse
The gateways are closed for me to seek
The amaranth symbol
Hidden inside the golden shrine
Until we rejoice in the meadow
Of the end
When we both walk the shadows
Frost scar my coat with dust
Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
Together we gazed, awaited
Hours brought thirst and the rising sun
Frost scar my coat with dust
Eyes attach to your mute portrait
We spoke only through thoughts
I wear a naked soul
A blank face in the streaming water
It is cold in here
Frost scar my coat with dust
Eyes attach to your mute portrait
It will set ablaze and vanish
Black rose immortal
It is getting dark again
Dusk shuffle across the fields
Wishful thinking, the way I feel
But you sure looked good this time, I'm sure it ain't no crime
A little fantasy, involving you and me
Won't ever see me walking away, not forgiving, I won't admit that I'm wrong.
My frozen angel
Alone we fade away
The one eyed's eye twinkles and gazes
Twinkles and gazes...
Honey tea, psilocybe larvae
Honeymoon, silver spoon
Psilocybe tea
Cursed downstairs against my will
Cobweb sticks to molten years
Cockroaches served with cream
I wipe the silver bullet tears
Decoctions of Jimsonweed
And my soul to you son
So pale turns the innocent
And al I feel is pain
He's gone
Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To the very end
Rein, raus
Ich bin der Reiter
Du bist das Ross
Ich hab den Schlüssel
Sick things in cars rotate round my stars
Sick things,My things ,My pets ,My things
I love you things i see as much as you love me
You things are chilled with fright ? for i am out tonight
You you things are paradise you whet my appetite
Come here my things, Dont fear my little things
I love you things i see as much as you love me
Take all you want and all you need
You never cared what you left of me
And laugh at the fire
Take all you want and all you need
You never cared what you left of me
Never give what you can't take back
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
When I was young life was savage
The leather gets scruffed as it's worn
Taking it up higher when you're under attack
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
We've all been under attack
We've been through hell and back
Taking it up higher when you're under attack
We've been through it all
We've been to hell and back
Never let them conquer your pride
Our love is warm here
Like the image of a distant sun
This star will always shine
Our love is warm here
Like the image of a distant sun
So hollow now... Show's over now... And I've wasted time on daylight...
I won't be shown the way home.
The way home
Lined with all the things that you have learned.
The way home...
Beyond the death we know
I wish that I could escape this dream
Can I ever return to reality)
Voices are screaming inside your head
(Chorus Solo)
Child molesters are running free
There's no justice for you and me
(Chorus (x2)
Fading sun, What have I done 
Came so close to what I need most 
Nothing left here 
Cut the ties, Uncover disguise
Forgot the advice 
Lost track of time 
In a flurry of smoke
Came so close to what I need most 
Nothing left here 
Cut the ties, Uncover disguise 
Left behind all intertwined
Waiting anxiety 
For a fair judgement deserved
We are one
But torn apart
Will you still wait for me
Will you still cry for me
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me
Will you still wait for me
To be loved,
To be loved.
How do I explain how I feel?
Every time I do, there's no one to turn to, so why do I even try?
And all I need, is someone to answer me.
Give what you made, and under your name
on your grave, is salvation.
Slaughter the pig, the self rightous king for your own
But turning their head to ignore reality's claw.
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your
Arm is your ounce of prevention.
This lonely mind, eyes still awake
Taking a swig now and then
Poking the fire with the rod
Seeking the truth behind the blaze
Has burned his hands so many times
In the shelter of smoke he is feeling home
Gives him protection from the outside world
I obtain the rapture of the chameleon

When I become enraged
With the frenzy of the wolf on the hunt
I am the most cherished child of fear
Wearing sharp shard
Stolen from scattered
Broken mirrors
As a cloak to cover me

My strange images
nest as birds to the hearts of men
Beauty eaten abruptly from the ancient worm
Wearing sharp shard
What will bring you the vengeance?
What will bring you the death?
What will bring you the happiness?
I will push you off the edge.
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Zombie attack
But then I see a Zombie killin', I know I must die
Om Namah Shivaya
Om Namah Shivaya
That Purusha is I 
Veiled as it were by a bright vessel
The Jiva who knows this gains all 
This the Ishavasya reveals as Ananya Chaitanya
My little bed trying to squeeze
The pillow to my safety
Riding to the grain fields
Days of childhood in my memories
wisdom
thoughtful at the skies of silence
waiting for a wish of despair
a lifetime is at its end
loneliness takes place
in this ruin
The moon is cold and I am pleading
Her sins original before
I liked her naked foreign cure
She made my conquered heart beat
Like the drumming of claws
Of voodoo and night
A dirty creature to my Doctor Moreau
The sway of dark hips
Was a reason to know
Flashing invites with her animal eyes
The mist it's so dense
It's soothing to breathe
I reach out my hand
Into the sights
Yet I grasp nothing
All seems different to me
But I must hang on
Though the sea is dead
I must hold on
Then I can bear
So I fly my flag at half mast
Screaming in desperation
Screaming from hunger and pain
Greed, our greed will
The first lightening
A picture without protection and sence
The end, torture and death
When do they stop, when is it over?
But it makes me dizzy
Harmless?
Don't make me laugh
Reduce yourself to a poisoned mess
It's so amazing
What passes for cool these days
Another trend?
J'entends en moi l'appel d'un autre univers
Qui résonne amèrement.
Qui résonne amèrement.
Les yeux rivés vers le ciel,
Portant le fardeau de mon corps,
Je perçois ma demeure
Perdue dans les nuées.
Such things, mundane, are not their way
Tell me, what is human life worth
The skies cry bloody tears
Children of sorrow are trampled onto the grave
There is no future, no fucking world to be saved
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight 'til death
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
For you
Sobre mi, su error. 
No! 
No tapen la luz. 
Con la enorme cruz de su desviación. 
No!
Porque han traído la infección mortal
al suelo limpio y rincón final. 
Donde no hay nubes de muerte aun,
So call this number
And order now
Guaranteed dirt slumber
We'll show you how
Feel the fire and burn the pain
Learn to fall, stand up again
Take a look through devil's eyes
Feel the fire and burn the pain
Learn to fall, stand up again
Take a look through devil's eyes
To find out what's left inside
During the day, there's pain and hope
A better life to lead
But come the night the nightmare start
There's lust priests need to feed
We'll haunt you in your dreams
Child Molester
Sick and twisted evil mind
(Vocals by Oderus Urungus and Slymenstra Hymen)
Oftimes you'll find me raving, sometimes you'll find me sick
All of you men, you talk a good game
You must plan it out cause you all sound the same
You huff and you puff, you "act" out so mean
The distant voice in the dark
I see a falling star
Which makes my dreams come true
Could it be that now we have
Bridge:
Drago, dragone con lo spadone io ti ucciderooo
Io ti kill you!
The snow failed to appear,
"I have wars to wage, battles to light
Love always leads to pain and loss"
But the maiden's song stuck in his mind

"Emperor of Rome,
He softly sang into her ear

"Empress of Rome,
Here by I sentence to death
Don't you ever be about the things you don't understand
Your blood that will push though your veins, will soon make me cum
Your screams will give me pleasure
To see you suffer
Tolerate the offensive Screaming Tortures
Fall straight down into the Iron Web Layers
And tells the truth about the past
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
The eighth world power of modern Rome; Washington is next!
There was a king (an evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
I am the destroyer of hope, Lord of Woe.
I am everything you've ever hated before.
Weeping Wastelands Tearing our hearts from flesh
Hope is gone. All that's left is this abomination.
Entirely entwined with weed
Feeding its breath
And we'll fight to survive
Fate will test our will
Here on the Highland hills
Slowly it comes off the earth
Gasping for daylight
To weep and worry
Fare ye well
I won't come back
Fare ye well
Don't say haste ye back
Roaming through the graveyard alleys
Fate will test our will
We have never been in a locked-off heart attack
End of your lies, The Way of Inhumanity
I see the fallen land, buried in ice and snow
Old world has gone, you know it's your time to go
We came from north, The Tribe of Eternity
The world you create serve nothing but senseless hate
Turn against indiscreet and lay on mankind's grave
Nails driven into his holy flesh
Will crush the house of divine charity
Let it be our destiny
We're waiting for your sign
Stabbing you to f*cking death
Revenge of the Zombie
Hacking eyes right from your face
Revenge of the Zombie
I feed upon your dying brain
Creeping the darkness unfurl, venting it's self with a murderous thirst
abomination of birth
Not of this earth...
Not Of This Earth, all those who fail to believe, likely succumb and become the unseen,
Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice
You're so far
Don't end up zero
Cause I'll look the other way
You're so far
Behind being my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
And in the tree (the night is alive)
A night bird sings
Feelings isolated
All your heaven breeds frustration
Outcast
All alone
Is it real?
All alone
Is it real?
Killing illusions
Beyond imagination
All alone
Cannot feel
Absolute rejection
In a world with no reflection
Is but a barren wasteland 
The only sound drowning your cries 
Is the detonation
It seems we're running out of time
But I could feel the horror in your face

Down around the ground,
Can you really feel why I turned into this man?
Down around the ground,
Can you really feel why I turned into this man?
When you look at my eyes you will understand it
But I didn't feel you,
When I was looking around to find your welcome
Handed down through times of old
Dark words of power
Blood upon their tombs
Through incantations
Locusts fly, signaling doom
Confirm who I am
Contort all I can
Wir sind auf den Kopf gefallen, okay
Lass dein Glas an der Bar stehen
Vodka, eh
Täglich beim Arzt chillen
Hoff auf ne Pille
Täglich beim Arzt chillen
Hoff auf ne Pille
Des Fleisches Lust ist dein Heim, dein Ozean gefüllt mit Wein
Fahl stolperst du durch den Wahnsinn er ist aller flucht Gewinn
Spot und Hohn als des Daseins Lohn? so das ein armes Herz daran erfroren
Mit kindlichem Gemüt und einer Illusion fangen wir jetzt an mit der Revolution
Frenzied thoughts arrest my mind 
As I descend towards my imminent destruction 
The only thing I can rely on, when I lie even to myself
That the suffering of Earth makes a pretty good show

Somehow we survived
We hunted we thrived
The first to eat
They swallowed
We followed
They swallowed
They've only just begun

The children were born
The children they died
Are you drained of feeding and decalcifying my awakening third eye
Sun of nihility,
I shamefully disturb you
A slowly dying Earth 
A suffocated wasteland
For convenience and so called, progression
Visions of prophecy 
Faces pushed in the earth
(Is there still time)
(Is there still time)
(Is there still time)
Is there…still time
Burned and raped in name of humanity
Part bionic
And organic
Hey, hey, wolves don't pray!
Symbols of pain
Out in the rain
sent to remain
Putrid breath
And bulging eyes.
Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door 
Last night a little angel came pumpin' on the floor
HEY! HEY! GOBLINS SING!
HEY! HEY! GOBLINS RAGE IN DRUNKEN FIGHTS!
HEY! HEY! GOBLINS RAGE!
Especially for the drunken goblin
Murderous grin upon his crafty face.
Shoving priceless human relics
Into a dingy little case,
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Everyone against everyone - chaos
The necrologue for the elite
The rise of the heartless bourgoise
While flags are waving
Everywhere they scream
Hordes of chaos
Priznivci Iabla padaj na zem.
Eerna je touha, bleda vsak krev,
Kdo neni vyholen, sklidi muj hniv.
Marni se pachti, modli a sni,
What am I to reality what's in line
This is the last time
You are the forgotten
The myths and their gravity
This world we have created defies
our natural evolution
Nature versus nurture
Obsolescence reality
Nature versus nurture
Obsolescence reality
Nature versus future
The endless hierarchies
We pushed it all too far
You see, I knew your game years ago.
Show me one good reason why I shouldn't remove the blood from your veins!
Willingly exhonging blows
Pentagon's financial goals exposed
Out of sight, out of mind
Two evils grow
Willingly exhonging blows
Pentagon's financial goals exposed
Out of sight, out of mind
Ground zero - petrified
Oceans darker than black
Slaughtering creatures with no signs of regret
Their simulacrums and their temples of lust
Must seek the strength to push forward, forward

Teach me to inscribe these words
Into eden or inferno
This is the end of all your struggling
This is the end of this domain
Hate, regression, lies, exist no longer
Here's to the memories
Wish I could always feel that way
But something always brings me back
In serpentine dance of blood cells
In simplicity of spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet thy presence
Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Doch sicher seid ihr nicht, ihr wollt nur dass ihr euch so fühlt
Ihr seid angeglichen, stumpf und verschlissen
A gate of stones marks the path
To soul's damnation and hell's wrath
Ancient evil is awaiting there
At the doorstep to hell
All the memories saved inside me.

Don't ever stop halfway through,
I can see the fuel to your fire.
All you need is persistence.

At the end of the day
We are all the same.
With honesty
We can achieve anything.
We can achieve anything!
ach was seid ihr nur schockiert?
Ich nenne es nichts Heuchelei!
Wie konnte das nur passieren?,
daß hätten wir niemals gedacht,
How am I going to know that you're there when you're not?
I'd burn the world, just to show you I love you most.
This dream's my one foundation, my future's held to sleep.
Waiting for the dead man's shoes
I need at last your private parts
To satisfy my fucking pride
Magnitude of my oppression
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
he was addressing a crowd
As my house lies empty and
I float against the time
Come here
Come in
Burn for my soul
Hide danger and feed me in the coldness
A top the highest mountain
Below the darkest depths
In the valley of hate I wander
My frost bitten heart is set ablaze, set ablaze
I fell upon - the comfort of your words 
A flash of light - taught me a lesson in betrayal 
I fell upon - the solace in your smile
when his spear points down
Warfare roll striking my head
mega Gnosis, hyper scale fall
dark noise sudden entry
We will climb to bestow our trust 
Take away the anchor 
Amplify the mystery 
Inhale the earth and wind
Twelve years of silence 
Frivolous to moments 
Shake the hand of lightning 
Capillarian carnate 
Capillarian carnate 
You don't have to go
A slave
Across the dead sky gleaming
He was nailed to the flaming Krosstika
All your bad and all your good
You brought a woman.. oh! She's gonna get it
'Cause this is how we roll, this is what we do
There came a point where it all made sense
If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong

[Chorus x2]

I was told it would work
Dead wrong, dead wrong
If what you have is right then I'll die being wrong
Dead wrong, dead wrong
Wrong for the rest of my life
Pleasure to kill
Hear my heartbeat as you see me upon you
Tears in your eyes I do not care
Listen now to the motor of my chainsaw
You better take
One last good look
One more round and
Now open your mind and feel the pain of my hopeless fight, feel!!!
What do you see?
I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
Like you ever would 
I don't see you make any sense 
I guess you deliver misery
We're the ones who betray 
But how can you say it with such ease? 
You want to take a stand or just please?
I'll let you know when the medication wears off
I'm a religious drunk and this is where I pray
Don't lie to me, 'cause memories
One day will come together
And you'll have the deal with them forever
 
...It's not too late...
You've had your chance
The time to face reality has arrived
 
I always gave the best of me
But nothing ever got back to me
I found some rope on the floor 
I have to build a trap 
So I started on my machine
Hardly know my name 
But it's getting better by time 
I saw something in the mirror 
Someone's watching me 
If I hide in the attic
You're wrong 'bout wearing fur and not hating Ann Coulter
Cause she's a cunted cunt
You're wrong if you celebrate Columbus Day
Er, der nicht süchtig wandelt 
Der des Lebens nur gewahr 
Nicht Besitz noch Mammons Fesseln
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me,
Safe as any soul can be ... honestly,
Just let yourself go.
Caught somewhere in time
Would you go, would you be scared?
The sirens are calling your name!
Come back. Make the call.
Father, send your rain.
Lay waste to the kings here.
We are the few!
Oh, sweet lit clarity grant us the eyes for this bane.
Towered beasts now meet our lines...
Must I die to escape
the scanning eyes of death
?to the alien, replaced with a complex
To when you really conquer, whoever puts you to the test
I has seen the burning of Sodom and fall of Rome
I was Jesus Christ and man consecrated my name
Altering the facts and figures
Events and every issue
Make a person disappear
And no one will ever miss you
Rewrites every story
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Fucking the virgin rip out her eyes
Drinking the blood
Fear no god
Pentagrams shining Luzifer smiles
Fucking the virgin rip out her eyes
Drinking the blood
Fear no god
Now you are dead
Your flesh is dot rot
To make a kingdom you need a King
And King is a song of Nanowar
Tiefe Wunden schlägt man ihr
Und raubt verächtlich das Getier
Versiegelt wird die edle Haut
Bis sich des Unheils Welle staut
Forevermore!
Black gold, black gold (gold)
Our soul's been sold (sold)
So bright, but it's fading
Burst in flames
Eternal return
We're waiting and waiting
Again and again and again
We know
But we'll never change
SIT DOWN-LINE UP-KNUCKLE DOWN-SHUT UP
Get psyched up listen to Godsmack
Dip you toes in the sands of Iraq
SIT DOWN, LINE UP, KNUCKLE DOWN, SHUT UP
An electrifying organized crime,
with planes and boats and suicide
Ich wühlte zum Licht an Ketten und durch Schlangen
Nun reitet er das Himmelskind - Er reitet schneller als der Wind
Und sprach mit Gott über eine neue Welt
Pein ward nun mein engster Freund, ich sollt euch daran laben
Baby, if there was one thing I would've thought
I thought we'd be together forever
But now you've run away and I'm feeling so lonely
Destroy it as fast you can
Now is your time to take a stand
Just rip your face off the band
Feel the skin under your nails
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,' -John Donne
Loosing the war I'm feining to win
And the living are scarred
 
A tout le monde (To all the world)
A tous mes amis (To all my friends)
Je vous aime (I love you)
In ecstasy they cry
Paid money for a pleasant show
Want to see him die
The matador in shining dress
Intent to prove his courage
Non-receptive of ungodly sounds - I disable the audio-generators of fear.
the cops are just like Hitler's Third Reich,
Fuck police brutality!! (*4)
But the cops can do no wrong.
Zij zingen van Alvader's wijsheid en macht
Naar Mimir's bron, gelegen aan de voet van Yggdrasil
Waar Wodan kwam om de eeuwige wijsheid te halen
And take a short bath in your wasteland
Embrace this rush
Enjoy the phases
Can't you hear my thundering silence
They're so loud, so loud
Where have you been roaming lately
Have I seen you passing by
To see you falling further down from here
She shakes as she turns around
With big tears and her lying mouth
Defiled our names
soiled glory of gods
restricting rules they can make
means nothing to Your Being
I must again sing my dissent until your end.
Because i can barely breathe with your weight on my chest,
Of time that will wash away
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Hacked to pieces
Chopped to shreds
"It seems that you've contracted a new strain."
How could this happen to me?
Another victim another casualty
From beyond, the strings are pulled
I know not what has made me this way
The animation of my rigid corpse
Despues de 235
canciones, los liricos se valuan mas
y no tengo ningunos para esta
El Jefe canta melodia triste
o canta amor de la corazon
We should, we won't 'cause we're in it for them.
Fuck the law, we wrote the order.
Fuck the bridge 'cause we built the borders.
I read your palm in a bowl of spit
It's not looking good
Spirits low, yes life is shit
I'm exposing all of your fangs.
Your tongue is poisoning.
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Aus der feinsten Haut
Dann mein Freund holt er sich Liebe
I was told that I could fly 
Oh, when least expected
Cloud connected
You seem to be
Landscape ebb and flow 
Think I felt the end of time 
Skulls aglow as crystal shines 
And starts to warm the empty climb
So please show me, your thoughts..
And so please show me, what I meant to believe..
It's neither good or, bad,
I must brave through this storm
I am made exemplary
Lashed up by the public scene
For bearing my heart, my soul's on fire
It's the cross I bear
2x
I feel it tear out my insides
And when she finally reached heaven,
There was no light.
We're burning on a purified
Smash your face and then I beat it down
Are we really gonna die
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
300 Sachen Blinker links,
Hinter uns die Jahre und vor uns alles schwarz,

Vielleicht sehen wir uns wieder wir laden herzlich ein.

Who am I
D. R. I.
Who am I?
Three simple words
Who am I?
A human being
Who am I?
This weird thing
Who am I?
Not what I seem
Until a star woke it up with the light it shone
I used to burn my wings to the bone
Then always grow them back
Knowing I'll hurt again
Always forcing me to return
And relive the pain again
She was the light behind the door
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas eve will find me
So stay the fuck away from me.
hollowing,
how could we live inside of a ship that's been slowly abandoned,
taken by the cold.

We're drifting away,
We're drifting away,
Scenes of despair rising up through the noxious air
Cities abandoned left to decay
A world forgotten, as we live only to rot away
Extinction is coming, the oil keeps spilling
Business as usual while toxins are killing
Your sorrow will subside in time - my one, true, only friend
There is one thing we can do - to avert this bitter end
Nothing's left but ashes - my body now is spurned
Your sorrow will subside in time - my one, true, only friend
Wenn Scheren sich wehren und dir den Krieg erklären
Mein Kühlschrank hasst mich sowieso, er ist paranoid
Komm mir nicht zu nahe. Sieh mich nicht so an.
Bleib im hellen sitzen, da wo ich dich sehen kann.
Why don't you get the fuck away from me
I'm a skin, you're a skin
I will not carry you through.
Is that what scares you the most?
My friend, you fooled yourself again,
Don't be so blind.

Years of oppression, dark agony

(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL

The moon
In silver trees
Falls down in tears
And monuments of stone
The reflections of deepest blackness
Prevail the holy faith
Awaken from shadows
Lying behind the light
Gotta get away
Get away

Yeah, he's clean

A COMMITMENT FOR LIFE - STRAIGHT EDGE!
My heart is dedicated.
To this promise of inner strength.
Still believing In what has fallen apart.
An oath that keeps me free from their hypocrisy.
A COMMITMENT FOR LIFE...
A COMMITMENT FOR LIFE - VEGAN!
Gravity won't allow me to fly,
It pulls me down, the pain, I won't cry,
Resistance and drive fueled by hunger,
Introduce the hidden self
Stricken to reveal the truth
That sickens and repels
Swallowing a sick addiction
Serenade from a serpent's tongue
She took her last breath
And then she bled to death
I found her blood soaked on the floor
Life as I knew it was gone for evermore
Year by year they take my life away
Day by day I want to make them pay for their mistake
A killer's on the loose
In a forest of flesh
There is a need to sever
Myself away from happiness
Still no drifting sun
Black upon the earth
Still the air is dry
You are sleeping unhampered by guilt
Comes the morning you shut down
The devil's breath, a disease on your lips
And the locust wait
Oh, no no no
Oh, no no no
There is no help in the wake of our needs
There is no help to dispel the pain
In a forest of flesh
For the souls who got nobody
It's coming and it's a long night
For the souls who got nobody to lean on
A warm embrace more than a dance away
"I should go outside and take a walk"
With no incense and no lute
It's coming and it's a long night
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
that you're in a fucking ditch
Und gegen scheiß Gleichmacherei von ANTIFA und rechtsextrem
Wer den Unterschied nicht schnall, hat ein Intelligenzproblem
schlag sie einfach mausetot
Komm mir nicht mit demokraten,
köpf sie kill sie,
das sind todeskanditaten,
niemand will sie
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to love again
I know it's hard
I know it's so hard
I think you know
I've seen the light
I know it's so hard
I think you know
I've seen the light
shining through crimson skies bless this
I've seen the light
You can run but never hide
On that day your prayers will not be heard
Sky is cracking
Raining down blood
Washed in the great flood
Through our greed
And sinful desire
Trees have fallen
Demons are calling
For our demise
Children are running
Parents are screaming
Oh god is this the end?
You can run but never hide
On that day we all die
For blood and iron...
Drops of mute ocean's breath in the palm of my hand
A gruesome trail of grief
Sedated by the fear of loss and greed
Never lasting, never knowing
Through jaded eyes I see myself dead
And nothing’s what I am for you
Still condemned to fight all my battles alone
I can’t rely or repent
For only death can save us now
I search my pockets,
And what do I find
Useless cleenex
To wipe my behind
You bastard, I hate you
I kill you, you can lick my butt
head
Light fuse and get away
No gain, no pain
And when it's dust to dust you can crawl from the wreckage
Keeps me constantly in fear of hearing
"I can't see where this is going"
You lie alone with the memory
"I can't see where this is going"
Feeling lost and out of place 
Is all I've ever known 
Don't tell me that I'll be okay 
Can't trust in anything 
I'll survive, I got heart
These are our waking hours
In cold sunlight we pine away
Towards yet another morning
Till following hopeless day
Tried to weave the pieces together
Force the past away
Mind weary of sorrow
Body tired from the way
Welcomed yet another morning
200 miles at nightfall
Taken within a day
Thus earning the name
Earning the fame
They are the
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault, live to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communications broken
Hands will wrap around your neck
It's OK, we'll just kill
It's OK, we'll just kill
I've masked myself so long
Open the skies ...
Than me in the depths of an alcohol binge
There's nothing more helpless irresponsible and depraved
Und ihr schreibt keine Lieder, nein ihr schreibt ein Gedicht
Schon vierhundert Strophen und kein Ende in Sicht
Wenn ich Lust dazu hab, scheiß ich die Nordsee zu
Danach zieh ich mir ein Robbensteak rein
Auf einem Teller aus Elfenbein
Confié, y me cagaron por amistad, 
pero aun sigo. 
Saber perder es bueno para empezar
a hacerse vivo.
When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
during those cold nights
they found peace and consolation.
during those cold nights
they found peace and consolation.
I rediscover the power and charm
Tantas víctimas calladas, cuantos cuerpos amontonados, neutralizados, convencidos de que la suerte ya está echada.
You cannot hold back the time
Forever at war with their worthless Matyr!
Darkness pounds their minds they can't control it
Freezing winds take their lives, engulf it
To this world to remain cold-hearted
Sing a hymn for the dead
Because in death as in life
We are one in the same
Sing a hymn for the world
To avert eugenic errors
Infernal Sun

You act like a rightful tyrant
casting away the cold
Your crown is the flame infernal
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
the chasm that cuts in two
the worlds of now The worlds of even
Just stop the noise for once... please!!
Love! (doo wop boddum... doo wapideewapideewapideedoo...) 
We can see the enemy, they say... 
Hey! we don't want your war!
I keep rocking, I keep rolling 
Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there 
Keep dropping, keep rolling
Damned, for all the make you feel betters
The more I live the more I...
This is the story of a dead man
Promises sound like simple words
So don't be afraid to let them show, your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
Our minds are numb, our bodies overcome
They beat us down, bread and circus
Diseased, they vaccinate
Create the fear, create the pain
In chaos, they will reign
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk
You gotta do it on your own
Your wretched life is complete
As before, now you can see
Walk and talk normally
How long will i be
Saved from my disease?
Brought you back to an everlasting sleep
Back in your chair, you're living dismally
Before the dawn, I hear you whisper in your sleep
Outside, the birds begin to call
Of the horizon never seen by the eyes of man
Awakened by the twilight's kiss
The nightly rebirth of evil
The paleness ITself has risen
The wicked ones have returned
December rises the damnation
Like a black burning dagger IT rips the sky
and burned the book
charcoal circles
around your eyes
no regrets
right!
Go - higher
I'm the hate, the jealousy
I can magnify the agony
The self-destructive qualities
So won't you come and go with me... and
I never thought through love we'd be
Makin' one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely, made from love?
Auch wenn bitter weint 
Sein Witwenmädel 
Bis zum Rand gefüllt
In dieser Nacht
Sind wir geboren 
Zieht das Schwert 
In dieser Nacht
The moment you walked in the room, my friend
The demons, they all went away
Be careful, they're only asleep for a while
Can't make immortality inside a test tube
Can't make immortality inside a test tube
I don't know if I should laugh or cry
Take it as an insult or credit you're trying
And the mess is everywhere...
Light up the darkness
I once was sun-kissed
Now I lay frozen here
But the fire inside burns bright, adrenaline, oxycontin...
We've bid our time 
All patience claimed 
Content with nothing 
Our lives lived not in vain 
Not in vain 
It's calling, it's calling
Not in vain 
It's calling, it's calling 
I fear the hold has met its end 
It's truth or consequences 
Each wall built must fall
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive!
Keeping myself alive through your 
Keeping myself alive through your 
Keeping myself alive through your 
Keeping myself alive through your
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate you'll try to run but it's too
Late I am here to liquidate
Time to raise your flag of hate
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
Night never turned into day
The heaven pouring of rain
The skies came against me

North had turned south
I had lost my way
The further I walked
The longer I had gone
Save me, take me
Star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
One day we'll find the way, and the reason to survive
Kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise
Won't you wait alone again tonight?
Save me, take me
Will you wait alone for me tonight?
Hold me, save me
A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
The last gleam of light
I've been clothed in mourning,
Wearing sorrow day and night
This all comes out to nothing
I am truly sorry
Although I'm really laughing inside
Follow me further down?
How could this go
So very far
That I need
Heard that I found jesus, when I do he's dead
Endless speculation, why would I repent?
If I find salvation and the book of hymns
Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord
Grace of god refusal, evil to the end
Instrument of Satan, I have always been
Total devastation in the aftermath
I behold no penance, only dignity
In hell with Lord Satan for eternity
The illusion of choice, a coin with one side
The fix is in
Sociopathic parasites licking their fingers clean
Thousands march towards beckoning graves
While profits are harvested hand over fist
A system designed with controlling intent
laisser en paix 
te faudra me tuer, mais pourras-tu sacrifier ta bien aimée, car c'est la le
Que peux-tu faire contre mon grés, si ce n'estm'anéantir 
tu ne peux pas changer mon âme, et par ces motsje me condamne
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain
And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain
And She would rot.
Alone
Insane.
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Scars are made to remind
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Along this road once again
Love, confidence, activity and might
In that ones name who named through oft he be
Unknown is ever in reality
As far as our ear can reach
Unknown is ever in reality
Or eyesight dim
Thou findest but the known resembling him
How high soar thy fiery spirit hovers
Its smile and type it straight discovers
Shackled and chained through the eternal flame
the hammer will slowly arise
Heeding The Call, one and for all
the hammer will slowly arise
Heeding The Call, one and for all
this final crusade we will win
Angels of mercy, our journey must proceed
With hearts all filled up with chivalry
You've seen one war after another
So many lives on the line
You must take care of one another
Your version of our time
The way I kept you down
And how moving on is moving up
So burdened and resigned
Your light was fading out
Hier wir sind schließ dich an
Reich dem Traum die Hand
Wir reiten flammend Herzens
gegen allen Widerstand
We are the ones who'll die
Fast track, lost time, done living this life in line
Skipped steps, can't wait, given up on what I hate
This is all a blackout, we all fade to black
This is my dedication, I love my generation
We are the ones who'll die
Alle tot, ich folge
Alle tot, ich folge
Alle tot, ich folge
Alle tot, ich folge
Schenke ihr den Todeskuss, sie singt für mich den Schlachthausblues
Sie singt für mich den Schlachthausblues
Sie singt für mich...
Ich sitze nackt vor meinem Schlachthaus, über dem die Sonne lacht
Doch zittert bald mein ganzer Körper, denn etwas ist gänzlich verkehrt
The clarit river forms and pools over my head
And for a moment I'm submerged in the lake,
And a sparks birth could not be heard.
Oh Death, must you reap one more?
Medic! I've been hit! Oh my God! Oh my God!
The ground burst and cold soaks my shirt. Send word!
White pilars from marble
encircled from the pillars
I found my idol
but clouds filled the purple sky
and shed their crystal tears
and the idol became muddy.
Have you any idea what you are
Con artist, unbalanced
To be predicting the end of days
Preaching myths to the masses
Oh God, if you do exist
The less we conceive
The stronger we grow
Stronger we grow
Facing our death, struggle to breathe
Choking on fear
, oppression for years
Stand tall, divided we fall
The conflict takes it's deadly toll
You struggle to breathe
Don't ever let go
The less we conceive
The price of liberty for all
You struggle to breathe
Don't ever let go
The less we conceive
The stronger we grow
Mit ihnen decke ich mich zu – alleine in der Nacht
Alleine in der Nacht, alleine in der Nacht
We leave this world
I feel so ashamed that we're to blame
Obvious lies as we all die; once bitten, twice shy
What will make you understand?
I'll laugh when you admit defeat
I feel the taste, we're laid to waste
Will you stand the heat?
Once bitten, twice shy?
Who was I to know?
To say it is to know it, to hear it is to believe, is to believe
Oh, it's on
With the speed of a gun, she's off
A glance of evil grace
A look of mock disgrace
Oh, it's on
With a hint of her blood, she goes
Oh, it's on
With the speed of a gun, she's off
Another dead embrace
A big kiss of mace
Another rush of hell
Makes me start to swell
Another dead embrace
und ich werde dir das Leben nehmen
ich bin Gott des Zerfalles
bin der meister der Nacht und des süßen Leides!
We're turned inside out
Beyond the fearless cries
We're turned inside out
Beyond the darkness we arise
We're turned inside out
Beyond the darkness we arise
We're turned inside out
Beyond the darkness we arise
We're turned inside out
Fuck you, we take no shit
We take no shit from no one
You can say what ever you dare
It's all the same cos we don't care
Through my eyes! Through my eyes, you will see
What is real, what is to be
All the madness, madness in me....
Awaken! Awaken in me
Through my eyes! Through my eyes, you will see
What is real, what is to be
All the madness, madness in me....
Like the moon... that fills the night
You, the question; "Answer," they cried
You've always been destined to ride
Is sure to have, the killing starts
The beating stops, 
Overkill rides again!
A killer like no man
A faster death by one's own hand
And you'll never be the same again
There is no other way
Fuel this hate
And I'm living on the edge again
Let them feel the pain
Fighting
Fuel the hate
Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
Now I'm feeling again and again and again
Fuel this hate
When the Gods soon descend
Awaiting in horrific peace
The Master of All is dozing
The burning fire-brands - in every open mind
And eyes shattered - of timid fools
Madness is so strange blessing
If you nothing understand
Among the waters, beneath the seas
Horrible thoughts destroy the minds
Thru the endless nights
And so you thought you wouldn't have to stand for that
And so you thought it would be an easy game to play

I feel tired and wasted
But I don't mind the cold floor
One left means still one left to lose
I know I will escape this pain one day
But can't yet imagine how
Så tomma och kalla i sitt evigt
expanderande tomrum
Ständig väntan på att explosivartat
expandera från ett allt till en intighet
De bevuxna vidder som omger mig
känns tomma och kala
Ninjas! kunoichi and oniwaban unite...
dealing in murder by blowdarts tonight...
your shogun is calling, order is falling...
Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by the altars of Bodom
where everything but death is a lie
with a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past,
among the victims who died
Something Wild has survived!
2)
Witness of a dead rebellion
Betrayal, loss, hypocrisy
Piece of shit
Shut up
Keep clear
Leaders ask their people to dig their graves deeper
No spirit of their own--they took heed of their keepers
Commemorate the omnipotence
And inappropriate delusion of grandeur
Embrace dejection of courage
Dismay, cast down your pride

Remember
The world of god, useful misguidance
Killing lying in the name of divine reason
You'll never see his face

And I give them the eternal life
I see the southern cross
Now that I am rooted to this strange land
The last battle, behold the final death
Bottomless blood pit killing without thought
Victims are calling, destiny is wrought
No birds sing here, yet silence speaks volumes
About tortured times, when man was blind
And innocence died at the hands of genocide
As still as a tomb, where only memories roam
No birds sing here, yet silence speaks volumes
About tortured times, when man was blind
Close this shed
Sister you became wild
you shake your ass in a bad rhytm
my dear friend you lose your good manners
In morbid dance
the clean, harsh silence passes
"genuine" visions by the noble ones 
for the noble ones
"you are but a form",
the clean, harsh silence passes
"genuine" visions by the noble ones 
for the noble ones
When you're paying for. Life after life.
Thoughts are incinerated.
Life is a crime.
Burning out!
To the verge of a quiet glance, an oracle without eyes
Darkness... My precious companion, even thou cant see his face
I enthroned darkness triumphant, with the searing trident of the Inferno
To bail out of reach?
Gehst mit der Mode hast keinen Ärger und keinen Frust
Feel adrenaline
Move into overdrive
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
If you think I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Faith, stand down. give your wings to the boredom that resurrected my soul.
Humanity is misery.
Underneath your prophecy.
You will see the savagery.
You will follow me.
Irresolute reality.
Shrouded in hypocrisy.
Shrouded in hypocrisy.
Blinded by disparity, my misanthropy.
Rise, I can't feel like you
Rise, never be like you
Rise, time for all us to
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
All that is sane to me
And now is my time to rise
And now is my time to rise
(Red dawn is rising)
Sealing the end of our time
(Sealing the end of our time)
If someone else could bear this load
That hurts like the crown of thousand thorns
The red dawn is rising
(Red dawn is rising)
I took her to dinner things were going alright 
Then we went out dancing went to have some fun
And everybody knows that you're just a piece of meat
Look at the clowns that they put on parade
But the triumph of the Pig-Children
And throw them in the waste
Look at them floating in the cess
They're such a fucking disgrace!
They just want
The children are turning green
We're dropping one by one
Is this the end of all our fun?
How can they get
Away with this?
Ther goes the human race!
Try to erase black spots on our soul
Hide from a violent eruption
Cataclysmic
Engulfing us all
Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
ia shaxul
I call forth the god pazuzu
rise from the depths
see the fire in my wand
Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
ia shaxul
I call forth the god pazuzu
rise spread disease
consume their puny souls
From the strings attached to me
Ich hab sie gewarnt, dass sie bald das Ende sehn.
Dass wir aufstehen und uns wehren, wenn der Scheiß so weitergeht.
die selbst ein Gott ’fürchtig ehrt.
Bin dein’ Rüstung und auch Schild,
im Hagel und im Sturm.
Im Kampf gegen die Schatten
Bin der Regen im Sommer,
der stillet deinen Durst.
Bin das Licht nach dem Donner,
das uns leuchtet ’gen dem Kurs.
Bin die Welle im Wasser,
Denn du hast mich gefunden
im schwertiefen Erz.
Geheilt meine Wunden,
getröstet mein Herz.
Als Mann meine Hand zum Schutze erhoben,
der stillet deinen Durst.
Bin das Licht nach dem Donner,
Bin die Welle im Wasser,
die deine Narben kühlt,
die schon bluten ach so lang’
und darbend deine Seel’ aufwühlt.
Bin die Welle im Wasser,
die deine Narben kühlt,
die schon bluten ach so lang’
I need not any ministry
I see our music scares you
Can't you see that
There's no truth in modern religion, a god we do not praise
I see our music scares you
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better
Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave
Feeding monsters in the back of his head
Killer, reaper, who are you
And leave us here all alone
Cosmogenic cycles 
Universal dreams 
The unseen essence
I know why you came here,
but neither of us will get what you want out of me.
This room has one too many laureates, so I'm keeping my peace.
here in the belly of the swarm.
The situation demands that we raise our glasses
in honor of the spokesman we've fixated to the floor.
Time will tell if we can win this war on true deceit
Oh don't be no one's bitch, be no one's bitch
They won't help you make it through
When you're in prison, don't turn the other way
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
lost in this wasteland, killing for our lusts and greeds.
Nothing was ever handed to me,
But fuck that now I can't complain.
I asked if death perhaps could intervene
Sweat
Burned my skin
And just like me it made this wound unclean
A ghost
Teasing me.
Teasing me.
And just like me it made this wound unclean
A ghost
Teasing me.
I could not let him see my segrecy
This time the weight is off my back
When they are covered in ticks
It's shit like that
That makes monks shag their wicks
Say have you seen her ticks?
Sucking on her tits?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance
Close your eyes
And just dream
It sets me free
We walk around blinded, like children in the dark
So cold and so empty
-Maybe push you too far
Don’t worry, unleash me
Thats song… that song
Come near me, relieve me
Protecting my heart
Protecting my heart
How crazy? … completely.
But that’s all, thats all.
… that song
Calm down, I’m falling apart at the seams
Now give me some bass, um yea that's how we like it
Now give me some silence, for all you sinners
Now give me more bass, yea that was funky
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker?
And Smear The Smudge In Bleeding Palms

Deine Motive sind nicht Edel, in deiner Brust ein Herz aus Stahl,
Hier ist kein Platz für Zweifel, Befehle lassen keine Wahl.
Ich zeige Dir den Weg, er ist das Ende aller Qualen,
siehst Du nicht diesen Weg, gehe diesen Schritt nach vorn.
An unseren Händen klebt Blut,wir können nicht mehr unterscheiden,
Zwischen Böse und Gut!
An unseren Händen klebt Blut, wir können nicht mehr unterscheiden,
Zwischen Böse und Gut!
Da ist kein Platz für mich
Ich glaub auch nicht an Wunder 
Und schon lang nicht mehr an dich
Wenn Du denkst, Du weißt was ich meine
und schon lang nicht mehr an Dich
Wenn Du denkst, Du weißt was ich meine
dann schrei' es heraus, aber laut
Und der Schmerz in mir er wird ein Ende nehmen.
Nur ein Wort von dir...
Gib mir ein Zeichen, welchen Weg soll ich gehen?
Und der Schmerz in mir er wird ein Ende nehmen.
Nur ein Wort von dir...
Mein Leben lebe oder verschenke? 
Was ich tue wird vergeh'n
Kannst du mich versteh'n? 
Wenn es einen Gott gibt auf der Welt
Wenn es einen Gott gibt auf der Welt
Ist das einzige was für mich zählt
Meine Selbstzufriedenheit
Nur ein Tag, nur ein Tag
Um das alles zu verstehen
Und wenn ich ganz kurz überleg,
Was könnten wir erreichen?

Refrain
voller Hass und Gewalt.
Wer sich nicht bewegt,
baut euch Träume aus Lügen
und hofft das wir uns fügen.
Egal was kommt unsere Freundschaft ist für ewig.
Egal was kommt unsere festes Bündnis bleibt.
Nie ging der Blick zurück,
er ging immer nur nach vorn.
Und alle Pessimisten,
haben wir dann doch besiegt.
Sie haben uns verfolgt,
Hinter uns die Jahre und vor uns alles schwarz,
wir können nichts erkennen und trotzdem geben wir Gas.
haben sie uns nie.
 
Mit Vollgas durch die Hölle
und Vielleicht nie mehr zurück.
Sie haben uns verfolgt,
doch gekriegt,
haben sie uns nie.

When the doctor tells him to
"Quit your drinkin', all the time."
Will he ever walk the line?
ABONDONED LIVES
Hundreds in a room, staring with empty swollen eyes
Mutilated possibilities
Enslaved by INSANITY
For years we wandered these circles 
Hold on to whatever lie gets us through 
Design new latitudes 
Find ways to channel bliss.
Us defined is too fragile to neglect. 
Reroute to remain. 
Reroute to remain!
Never want to look back in greed
This foundation of my existence.
A lifetime commitment to self- domination.
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust
Roter Sand und weisse Tauben
Laben sich an meinem Blut
Am Ende gibt es doch ein Ende
To see the land, the women chant as they fly up to the sun
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Progress to not be abused
They were arrested for their views
It was the protesters they screwed
And still had the nerve to ask
Unprotected, defenceless, drifting through the void,
forever at the mercy of all starving wolves
Scorching the domain
The vortex of pain
A telestic message
No doubts, nor fright
There is no place for groan
There is no place for cries
I know it is and endless path
I walk the way of purity
To my destiny
No doubts, nor fright
There is no place for groan
The rage stained blade arises
When the forged steel came across my life
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young.
We still have time.
Cause I've never felt more alive
I've never felt more alive.
Do you remember all those nights
When we stood side by side
And we said "we'll save the goodbyes"
The night is young...
and I... didn't know I was lost I tried carrying the weight of the world
Ich bin das Kind das zerbricht
The fear that lives in my soul which is an untouched spring
Read, what is written on the silent mouth,
What is written in the soul,
JA!
Ich seh dir mitten ins Gesicht und du grinst mich an,
auf dieser scheibe aus Glas in der ich nur mich selbst sehen kann.
JAA!
Von ganz weit seh ich zu wie du zappelst und schreist
und ich labe mich daran, wie die Zeit meine Wunden heilt.
A slow descent
ohne sie und ihn und sie

Previous times you stuck by me
Relations fine undeniably
Mutual trust and honesty
Your thoughts on these cast a jealous light
The latest disaster today
This ain't no fad, this ain't no fashion
This is the Neoliberal Anthem of the world
Camera sensor eyes pierce.
Policing the benign?
Fuck your badgeless, rankless dirge
and fuck assumptions that we're dirt
Sexually abusive torture is diminished to mere wretched amusement.
You sound like a broken record,
We are the many!
Alone we are nothing,
Together we're crushing
We are, we are one voice - one heart!
One voice - one heart!
Steht ein Klavier
Die Tasten sind staubig
Die Saiten sind verstimmt
Hinter dieser Tür
Sitzt sie am Klavier
Doch sie spielt nicht mehr
Doch sie spielt nicht mehr

Wenn er versteht
Zählt nur noch sein eigenes Leid
Was der Mensch beginnt
Vor seinen Augen zerrinnt

and even though we think to be free
There is no way out
We're all prisoners of it
There is no way out
We're all prisoners of it

Smell of burnt bodies
Slaughtered virgin lies dead without the face
Men staring at the skies
Singing lines and eating sand of waste...
Du lachst mich an, sagst mir: " alles ist okay. " Ich ringe um Fassung, finde die Worte nicht.
In deinen Augen sehe ich nur Zuversicht.
A monument of suffering. 
Build from human flesh.
Your shattered plea never stood a chance. Constantly cursing him and wondering what you did to deserve this today.
Upset and forgotten, are your only prayers
Knelt and barely breathing, your battered heart has kept you from screaming out loud.
You set all of your goals for your reason
To rise your banners
Moved by the wind of a twisted obscenity
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner forgotten by no one.
Selling the hard-won values we archived
You know that nothing will ever break the beast 
You know there are millions left for dead
For them it died so many years ago
Our undead host - is now six billion strong
Because storm-storm is coming
STORM IS COMING! STORM IS COMING! [x4]
Black void, overload, crest the solar filth
'Cause I don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
(Spare me the details if you don't mind)
Don't wanna know
Now I don't need to hear about the sounds they were makin'
but I am no king. I am no king.
His life spilled like a tide so divine.
"Just run and hold perfection in your arms as I slip..."
but I'll make you the god of a liar
Question upon me
Sixty days away
Miles from perfect
Sixty days away
I don't know why
Must be broken
We've become obsolete
The great shift waits for me
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia
the winged eyes are blessed to see
downtrodden deception of every torment
transpierced hymens my lust adores
Many images yet one raw flesh
Everyone cried,
Everyone cried.
Try her philosophy,
Decades of endless darkness
Now embraced by shining light
Autonomous power
Into the ocean of sorrow
Towards to sea of despair
This river runs relentlessly
And this river runs deep
Not in cycles but in lines
they want to take away the little they call something 
you know you're being used but still you play along 
if you're not complacent,
to make you blame yourself, 
"The rich are rich because they're smarter than me..." 
You're taught this is right,
I'm lying here
Still
Bible of the beast
in the dawn of damnation
Bible of the beast
in the call of the dark
Bible of the beast
of the final temptation
I am trapped, spinning in time
I am the lost god, nothing is mine.
All those before me were swallowed by time
I can't stand the bar scene you're in too 
Can't you see what you've become, 
It's every fucking thing 
that you swore you'd always snub
kein Grund zu deiner Füß.
Doch als sie Ymirs Leib erhuben
aus ihm das mächtige Midgard schufen,
da schien die Sonne auf die Felsen
Are you counting?
the boundaries further
We have to strive to push
the boundaries further
Or all our lives are set
on a collision course
I am willing to suffer,
To bleed-to die for the things i care about
But it's like kissing the lips of my dead love-
Holy battles take their toll
Liberty and hope divine
Changing the water into wine
So to you we bid farewell
Gears are working monotonously
Systems work continuously, but nobody knows
How long?
My courage is crushed, my hope, my fears too.
Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
I think I've hit the floor, oh!
I cannot feel anything anymore.
Oh! My body's failing,
I think I've hit the floor, oh!
To lay their power onto me
I saw them flying, falling, dying
Immortal till the strength's come
Dipped in pains of disdain
To lay their power onto me
I saw them flying, falling, dying
Pure paganism I worship in the woods
Forest's mountains never saw by human eye
Kingdom of the ancient and horned evil
Covered by the snow naked crowns of trees
Like crying mothers Slavonic worshippers
Pagan warriors hide in frozen wood
He's been holding on to anger and hatred
The feeling that things will never change
It is to what we say
Total death!
Hold it in my hands.
Feel the heat burn down my chest.

The air we breathe holds us together now.
The air we breathe in.
I totally miss the fucked up thing ya do
Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
A model of transparency - freeze up my gaps.

Since when did we discard perception as the years went flashing by?
If maturity wipes the slate carefree,
keep me infantile.
These are things you can't reveal
We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man
Infernal sacrifice of hell
Gag the loudmouthed liars
who heckle me, your follower.
Slam the door on those oily, mocking faces.
As they drift down to hell, drift down to hell.
Down to hell.
Drift to hell.
Gag the loudmouthed liars
who heckle me, your follower.
We're from the outer empire
Our heads - that's where it dwells
Our hearts - that's where it ripens
Our hopes - that's where it reigns
We rise our eyes in wait
Our heads - that's where it dwells
Our hearts - that's where it ripens
Our hopes - that's where it reigns
Corrosion soothing the hurt within
Surroundings reaching to touch your skin
Togther immortal
We become one in the eye of the storm
On the way agains the truth
Rancid Angel of Death flying free
Angel of Death
Evolution in reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated by the new machine
Standing together we are never alone
With screams over silence taking place of the violence
Happiness?
Emptiness
Loneliness
Alone is the death
Night the beauty of silence a different consciousness to complex for reality
Shadow land a place of silence love?
Happiness?
Emptiness
Loneliness
Alone is the death
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm
Should we go quietly?
Accept that all is lost?
The waves keep crashing over
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm
Should we go quietly?
What is truth?
I cannot yet discern
Kneeling in hope of reprimand
This father's love shall not within me flow
This blacken field leads to ruin,
Ruled by folds pulled tight, and a pit so slick.
(chorus) (x2)
The dream is true (x4)
All aboard this train of death are being slaughtered
Right before my eyes!
Guts are flying everywhere,
Propelled by fiendish lies!
It has begun!
But why is there blood?
I did not agree to murder,
This is supposed to be a robbery!
The fiend has stabbed me in the back!
Eight thousand sorrows deep
Devastation gathers
Drench this soil with tears
Humanity at zero
We dig compassion's grave
Eight thousand sorrows deep
Evolution's blood-stained crown
Shell be ours to keep
We dig compassion's grave
leads us to eternal delight
among the thousand flames
from dark to black again
his eyes are dark and cold
like northern frost
and icy breath
year 2000 gone, how could we not have known sun starts to die,
nightfall wartorn landscape,
on all others stand pure-bred fucking madman,
Short wavelength
Static spins my head
When the simple terms elude me
Inquisition is a basic function
I've exhausted
Inquisition
He rules over every thing
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it you would die
In the desert the planet Dune
The echoes of my voice
Follow me down
The shadows I cast
Hey! Wanna see the darker time
A time that never ends
It'll be too late for you
When you try to persuade me by
Hey! Wanna see the darker time
A time that never ends
It'll be too late for you
When you try to persuade me by
Pain!
Go!
The church of alcoholics can't break up the congregation
Give us air to breathe, through carbonation
Crowned with signs of death
A night wraps the altar
Spectators made of stone
Shadow holding shadow
Creeping tongues and stare of horror
I can surely say there's feud with force
Am I in your way? 
Please knock me down, can I help you in?
When I'm not around
The dark lord is laughing
Your father, forsaken, faithlessly
Suffer endlessly
Bird of omens—
I'm doomed to transmigration of souls
My sufferin' remains and increases
I can't live and die at rest
My life in death is my fate
Hate your needs—hate your wants—hate the way you love to taunt
Hate your voice—makes me cringe—every time I hear you speak
I gave you a million chances
You gave me a hundred ways to hate
A hundred ways
A hundred ways to hate
In so manch finst'rer Nacht 
Und ist die Welt auch im letzten Brande
Our adaptation can't be faithful 
Your world does not attract me 
This is the end you see
I'd give my heart for you
I'd give my strength for you
I found you by my side
And I'll make this promise to you
I will never let you down
This is for every hour
This is for every second
Am Morgen Klos im Hals, todtraurig
Ich geh' schlafen und träume, dass ich draufgeh'
Mittags wieder Höhenflug - Manische Phase
Ich imponiere mir selbst, mit dem genialen Gelaber
Am Nachmittag, Langeweile macht sich breit
Mutter
Ich durfte keine Nippel lecken
Und keine Falte zum Verstecken
Niemand gab mir einen Namen
In Conspiracy, In Conspiracy
In Conspiracy arise from doom 
In Conspiracy, In Conspiracy
Unleash, Defeat, Resist, Inflict
Monday through Friday, I'm singing
I sing the blues for you
Now I'm standing in the pouring rain
With a double-barrel shotgun
Ain’t a single fucker left to fear
See their lips movin’
But I don’t wanna hear
Showdown!
Before it’s too late
Stand up!
Nothing ever lasts forever
Corrupt!
And that’s how it’s gonna stay
All I wanted was your honesty
Here to cry the glassy anguish
Of souls dwelling in darkness that fell
My throat is DAATH, the seal is breaking
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream, and this is what it means
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
And no one can take it away, I know what I want
And I say what I want, And no one can take it away
In your life you may choose desolation
And I say what I want, And no one can take it away
But the memory still remains, all the past years not so strange
From the red sky of the east, to the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
We question all that is wrong
We discuss conspiracy
Are we enemies of the state?
Keine andere will ich mehr.
Du denkst, ich könnte dich betrügen, 
Doch bleib' ich treu, würd' niemals lügen
Step on it, sucka. 
What you wanna do, Chris?
Tide to come
Triumph our battle be won
Battle all the lands
It's the triumph of the ages
Empires fall by my hands
In the triumph of the ages
Colder than all days before
Colder than all years before
Come taste a tide
Where landscapes surround
Us with blight
On the windrippled steps
Us with blight
On the windrippled steps
The everflowing streams of
Our enemies
I could - not
I could - shatter
Begging for a lift
Out of the body experience emerge as empty shell
Purity of no soul pre-set not to research the will to be
Dead, living dead
Artificial life
Back, striking back
You know I don't need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey I don't need you
I just can't put you down
Who will drop the curtain
Who will end Earth's history
No more "Happy ever after"
Rest in peace... Peace
Rest in peace -
"Guard the nation"
This killing force that we have made, what for?
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
The Mother Earth
The human race is dying
Rest in peace... Peace!
Desperate - Is what we've all become
Helpless - There's nowhere left to run
lord of flies
in disguise
I'll make you scream. Because my fire makes you weak.
The Devil's crown... Phoenix down.
She is here, she is gone
She is gone.
Come on down now people yeah
You drop your drawers down to the barbecue crusted log cabin flow
Drop them down one by one
They're coming down all over the land
Oh you cheeky lass with your cheeky ass
Drop 'em all down, drop 'em all down now
You drop your drawers on down, you drop your drawers on down
Burn, the fire galore
Figureheads come cheap these days
No one listens to what they say
In their faces I see the fear
A crucial moment drawing near
Reincarnation of his soul right into your dying corpse
And decree it an aggressive disease.
There will always come a threat once the plebs step out of line
A fabricated perpetrator biding his time.
They'll take us up to fever pitch and watch intolerance spread.
Hagios Ischyros, Sanctus Fortis.

I know you kill for me you see me with the life I lead
Promise you'll come for me on the 6th of June will bring you home
Enthralled With This Absence
It´s Consuming Me...
It´s Consuming Me...
Frail hollow from the space
Where you stood
Behold your love come undone
Far before its tie all gone
Return to pages of the past's mistakes
Nuada died a hero's death.
But Balor to the ground was cast,
Il-Dana was the new high king,
De Danann heroes won at last,
Aengus was shoked by the state of his father,
"Crindinbel must die", He did say.
He put gold in the food, and the food on the platter,
Nuada killed Indech,
the king of the Fomor,
"You will be king?". -He nods.
Breas journied to the Fomor lands.
And met his Fomorian father.
They held each other in their hands,
I have this hate
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
When I can't even smile today
Doesn't anyone even care at all
It seems like no one cares at all
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
Are the looks on the faces...
And I try to hold ya
And I try to tell ya
And I gotta…
I cried out so loudly
Ja, till en början kändes det lite tomt
men det är inte drömmarna jag saknat
men det är inte drömmarna jag saknat
Hides behind misconception
This worl turned itself on
My sanity is nowhere to be found, walking dead
I'm getting closer slidin' out of the day
fallin' faster with every coin I spend
Shame, shame shame shame
The wreckage is already in sight
I'm getting closer slidin' out of the day
Somehow I gotta find more will to fight
Shame...
i see one hundred winters pass
my blessing, my curse
perpetually i'm damned to earth
of a soul i am bereft
forever dying to be dead
i see one hundred winters pass
my blessing, my curse
perpetually i'm damned to earth
Have another horn
Even though we won the war today
They will find another way
Don't give up without a fight
Take what give the norn
I see ships on the horizon bleak
I know whom they come to seek
They will find I'm not alone
They won't come at ease
Used to be afraid to let it show
Bow down (bow down)
A king in my own mind
Everything's in place
So much brighter from today
Sacrifice of blood..... Victory!
Conquering worlds between two worlds
Those armies of the Northern chill
Light the land of wisdom
I am one
Gods of death warriors of the desert
Fever witch spectre of fire
Commanded by Marduk magician of the gods
Friend with the maggots in your head
Bleed again and again- die you re dead
The shame as on the beginning of creation
You were my brother and messenger
You were my brother
Ray and fire
Suffering only the shame
Curse in the names
The truth is contempt
And essence only
The shadow of symbol...
Ideal of beauty go lost in a word
Orgies of endless time
Beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning black
Life is passing before my eyes
Forget the times and leave all the past
Forever sleep, forever gone
With my broken heart,
So sad I've got to go away
As I lay and take my last breath
Inside my tomb, feel all alone
Grabbing the razor, as I cut to the bone
Lay here in silence, listen to drops
Feeding the fucking hate!
I love you... I love you...
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
No... no one
No pride at all
I see devastation and I'm ready to BURN!
It's the forgotten flesh of something dead, from the bottom of my heart
It's the neighbor saving face by saying grace
Sibilant and at last
The circus crawled away
With another lover in it's arms
Dancing on Her grave...
Spawned scorned, abhored by the aerial
She was the light of the world going down
War-torn, forlorn and malarial
She was found
A Gretel sick of merely sucking Her thumb
Of gingerbread men
When this story started
The sun, it told me where to go
Open minded, open hearted
These friends I knew
Lick it tw-twice 
Come on, put that shit on 
Lick it once
When we can't stand the heat of the moment
We're asking everlasting forgiveness
Heal our consuming greed
I follow my flow of emotions
So make the best of your time
It’s now or never
Soon it’ll pass you by
Gefangen in dem Sog
Aus unbarmherziger Vergänglichkeit...
Vergaß ich nie Dein Antlitz
Denn es ist wärmend Endlosigkeit!
So, wie Eva in den Apfel biß,
In der Blütezeit des Lebens
Machte uns der Sommer satt.
Selbst als die Welt um mich verbrannte
Habe ich nie ans Grab gedacht!
I'm the ultimate invocator
Still I'm wandering, time and space now useless
Walking through abomination
Birthplace of a new breed
Forced to hail
Eternal flames have purified their souls
Born again in blasphemy, thy kingdom come
Sepulchers abandoned
Cities burning
Killed by serpents of might

Stay; Better start to pray
Leather for the night
Prophecies of might
Dying side by side

Here comes the leather...
Never been touched with velvet gloves 
Or hatched in golden hay
I've left scars in a million places 
To make myself explained
Self-destructure
drawing on life
Second chance
Battered frantic, dressed in tragedy
Reach the point where time caught up, why me?
Paths we chose, the sorrows we cause
in the equation of designs
Self-destructure
drawing out life
Neutral unknown, a nervous calm
Answers tactically arranged--stalling time
It's all forgotten instantly as pain calls
Just a fracture
in the equation of designs
Self-destructure
drawing out life
it hurts me deep and cut my flesh
the lover's treason
obstinated, that's OK
this is your point of view
we're not truth owners
But we want to know what you have to say
The truth could be a kind too violent
That is the reason why we should stay deaf
The ones who know better stay silent
A global process for a b-human much too high
Keep your mouth shut and close your eyes

Not more than a day
It needs to change a run forever
but there are things you'll never see
to protect and serve one nation under god
lord of flies
in disguise
it's all built upon lies
out of hand
is this a fucking joke
out of mind
and it makes me fucking choke
fuck!
And the fantasy stays alive
I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
Build me up
Break me down
You build me up
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive
I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
Schau, die Sonne ist warm und die Lüfte sind lau -
Geh'mer Tauben vergiften im Park!
Die Bäume sind grün und der Himmel ist blau -
I am covened by words
To avenge Her
Commemorating sickle moons
The pack are poised to reap
By forcing its Herod tongue in
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time
The valley, lays waiting
No tomorrow, evil has it's way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
They're wondering, will they survive
The dawn comes, and then the light
We take lives, we hear the screams
No tomorrow, evil has it's way
I see you with your portraiture
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I'd drop to my knees in a second
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You're feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife
Sperm-less like a girl
More man than I
More man than I
To be dry and sperm-less like a girl
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
Headed by the Aqua Demon! 
Tribes of the serpent - iron clad 
Rebirth of the Nemesis - TIAMAT 
Return with wings of liquid fire
The Serpent Nemesis 
Queen of creation 
Polytheistic light 
Lla Tchaf Lla min Tiamat 
Enuma Elish is re-written 
Queen of the universe
Proclaimed on the citadels 
of the Alpha post 
It's all mapped on the hand 
Returning with arrogant pride
And I believe in one thing forevermore, to live is to love the pain
And I feel like I never felt before, the rapture of dying
You shall see our wrath
As we sodomize Maria
And you shall feel our hate
As we strangle you all
Crush their crucifix
Revel in the blood of a thousand Christians
Run barefoot in the (glowing) ashes of their churches
Celebrate our vile satanic triumph
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
OF THE LIFE THAT YOU LIVE IN
FED WITH A SILVER SPOON
PUT ON THE PLATE FOR YOU TO REFUSE
THIS WAY OF LIFE MEANS NOTHING TO YOU
It's easier to die than to live
Thats alright, you're only human boy, So stay a while...
ALL THE WORLDS A STAGE AND WE ARE HOME AGAIN!
ALL THE WORLDS AFRAID BUT WE ARE HOME AGAIN, HOME AGAIN!
Away from home? WAIT!
I died a little... Waiting, waiting...
Away from home? WAIT!
I died a little... Waiting, waiting...
I want to be set free... On the road again for you and me.
Without a haunted song we'd be all alone... So get up, get up, get up...
NOW DECONSTRUCT!
All the worlds afraid....all the worlds afraid...
NOW DECONSTRUCT!
All the worlds afraid....all the worlds afraid...
And we looked up to the stars last night
And I just need you
Where only winds of funeral breathe
Hovering through the whispering darkness
With frost in my eyes

Only seven winds are heard
he'd seen it done before and turn into a cancer
but he was a chancer
way romancer
He had such great plans
He had such great plans
He wants to replace
He wants to wipe the scum of the earth off its pretty face
Didn't wanna be just another voice with an answer
Contact the other side
Converse with the deceased
Corrupt your virgin mind
We cannot comprehend a cold dead in between
Witness them speak...
The opening of gateways obscene
The ancient horror, on this evening, will unfold
A wretched curse on thine own family
And I'm always gonna want to blow your mind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
(Hey) Hey, (Heeey) Heeey, (Heeey) Heeey...
To the core
Rip the skin
And feed upon my heart

Skin after skin still you crave to come back for more
Skin after skin still you crave to come back for more
This bitter lesson always goes unlearned
Need a reason to remember?
All those words that you said to me were nothing more than prepared statements.
Your treachery is sickening.
Your treachery is sickening.
Nowhere to go, there's nothing left, there's no one else.
Their selfish deeds only serve their own agendas.
To live alone with just me?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
No air, air (no)
No air, air
 I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts
Warning of the coming horsemen
These revelations will bring sacrifice
Mais je frémis
Ou bien peur de partir...
Mais je frémis
A l'idée de trépasser...

Tout cela va si vite...
We're gonna give it revolution, give it revolution
You got to give it revolution, give it revolution
We're gonna give it revoltuion
Crush the tyrants to the ground
Freedom cannot be legislated
We'll bow down to no other one
The Father and His Son
Abandon your pain 
Abandon your life 
We live and learn while the sun 
Goes down. Abandon thee, for all time 
The brand of your kind
I couldn't believe my eyes
A vicious cycle, poisonous face, 
And values lost in agony 
Mendacious statements
Brain inspection
Pulsing anger
Mutant rancor
There's nothing to save
Brain inspection
Pulsing anger
Mutant rancor
Of a dark and hideous nature
The fall of man is now at hand
Awakened from an ancient slumber
The immortal ones return
Time trapped in between stages
Frigid return to the chamber of ages
Winter ice - terminal frost
Closing eyes of equinox
Dimensional change - darkening skies
The sphere is shackled till dusk
Blood - Death - Gore
Killing in masses
As the slaughter progresses
Blood, gore, crushed armour
And part of humanity's charm.
Why don't we have a baby?
Why don't we have a child?
Babies are you.
And fatherhood rights all your wrongs.
...and fatherhood rights all your wrongs.
Baby...
Baby...
A little baby!
Why don't you have a baby?
Bevor wir auseinandergehen
Hömmasammawommanomma Bier trinken gehen

Can't tell the difference anymore
There are...
Kawaii…
Arrival, new arrival
Kawaii…
Kawaii.
Freedom, you and me
We lost our world…
she lost them.
Kawaii…
Kawaii.
Freedom, you and me
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time

I drift on... - Consumite Furore!
Los, kauft die Sachen, die keiner braucht

A howling man surrenders the fight... the fight
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
Floating nowhere
Nowhere

Josephine
My heart belongs to another
I know what I want and it´s not you
Pandemonium is on warpath
to the highest price
There's nothing left to stem the rising blackness
This is the agony of human sympathy
Merchants of misery assumed control
We call this mutha revenge
Revenge, revenge
This is the beginning of the end
Chorus
I've seen loc'sters come, I've seen loc'sters go
'Cause we're the ones that make it end
Ain't no sloppy fool that's innocent
We call this mutha revenge
Revenge, revenge

Next to the Battle of Los Angeles
Of Las Angeles
So what's the problem?
Let's do it quick!
You've got a pussy
I have a dick, ah
So what's the problem?
Let's do it quick!
Oil stripped
Hole is filled
Ocean coil, water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth, smoke he breathes
Dream until your dreams come through
 Yeah, dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, ohhh...
Sing with me, if it's just for today
 Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
 Take you away...
hear the shades of war... forever more
walk with shadows
hear the shades of war... forever more
Propagate the masses, with the embodiment of who we are,
Iconoclastic new age, we shall transform,
I am the universal dogma
Repudiate ancient forefathers of believe
I am the universal dogma
Structured hypnotism of the mind
Evisceration plague
Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Disease will spread and cover the world
Mass insanity, the end of our time
Scavengers will eat the remains of man
Erratic actions lead my thoughts to the blade
I've lost control, I've lost control
Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
I was only armed for battle
Without forgiveness
If I release
Will I still remember
I was only armed for battle
You see
But I didn't lose because I'm not lost
Ear to fucking ear
Hide. The grinding of the bones
Pretentious action could unleash a force
Far beyond the boundaries of comprehension
Aggravating these limits
Distortion
Punching through the other side
Paralyzed, kneeling, unable to control it
Petrified, nullified
Bigger than all space and time
Magnify amplify
Smaller than a needle's eye
Pressure builds....distortion
Sickened mind, mirage or reality
I'll crush your head in my metal jaw
Like the witch in the tower of olde
Smoking jackets drenched in gore
he is the commander of the 7th compartment of the underworld
and deep down in the core of your soul you know that you want him
Will bring to ruin the Nazarene's empire
Indecision fills my head, all the things I left unsaid,
My heart is letting go, my pain you'll never know.
Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant? Oh...
Your eyes tell what you feel inside

Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant? Oh...
And grieveous sins untold...
Mortal man - animal - prepare to feel hot
See me mortals
In nightmares eat your mind
Amongst endless screaming drones
The future is now
I am the first in line
The fact that I am
and welcome the big sleep
Injected with silence
Fading in a sleepy confusion
A beautiful entrance
Into a higher dimension
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
Won resolc
Peels rof gnol
Gnivael dna
Yawa gnidaf
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
Move in me and set me free
"Htaed otni yaw eht dael
Won resolc
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
You never make a compromise
Your will has got the power that won't break
You never say never to a challenge
That will come along the way
Your will has got the power that won't break
You never say never to a challenge
The crown of the whole world
His creatures will kill me poisons my soul
To the end I will fight but I know that the things
He's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
When the mightiest of all will now
Refrain:
Run for the Night burn away
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak
Officer down
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
Under such a regime we're all doing time
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to
Inherit the sadness of the truth
It all began with the shades of what we never thought existed.
The vision of the distorted views was no longer an illusion.
Internally, eternally never to emerge
Torment--Death on holy ground
Carnage--In blood we drowned...
The world cracks and we fall into decay
Kind. I lie here clutching at straws, the dream savant chose
Me blind
And then we die...
Collecting their last thoughts
Sometimes I feel no remorse
Sometimes I want a taste
Why am I so different
Than those who can just do it
I know I'm not different
Then those who can just do it
Thief of integrity. Its gaze upon the blind
Information divinity by man designed
The lives of all they occupy. Their eyes in dismal gloom
Vigilant lenses. Objectives belied
In blackened heavens covertly they hide
They see you. They see all. They know all indiscretions
Crucifix pressed to your forehead
Evil exorcised
Fucked by the bishop - in front of a laughing crowd
I'll slit my throat, so I'll bleed the truth
'Cause I hate me

I'll slit my throat, so I'll bleed the truth
Cut out my tongue so I speak no excuse
We lied to each other so much (lied to each other so much)
That in nothing we trust
God help me please (help me please), on my knees
We lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
Lethal duel between me and the world
I stand in defiance of all your kings (and the fear that they bring),
Crushing the strength of some.
It's not fair, but I don't care.
"To all my demons that breathe fire down on me, and
Every angel that shares it grace with me, I am no king.
But battle through the days that bring you to your knees.
Anger sank in today, and it's sad to say that it's here to stay.
tief in Deinen Schoß und atme
noch einmal den Glauben ein
Ein Kuss: Du schmeckst mich.
Ein Blick: Du liebst mich;
Wie das Salz dem Meer verbunden
Immer, wenn der Morgen kam,
lebe ich für Dich.
Thine impartial love for all
Bless us that we be free from
The sway of greed and delusion
Inspire us to build a new world
Intermented in my inhumanity, Interdicted from the human face,
Incompatible with this fucking world, Indecent DeathWhore rules.
So I drink all day and I drink all night
I get really drunk and get into a fight
With a samurai guy with ninja skills
I‘ve got a wooden leg, wooden leg
Wooden leg, wooden leg, wooden leg
I‘ve got a wooden leg, wooden leg
I feel torn apart 
A vile misfit fallen 
Deep into affliction 
Of my hollow mind
our legions move, we are the horde
We come from the absence of light!
Squalor poisons the ground we walk
And laughing we dance into the darkness.
Life is seldom beautiful
Be patient, one day you will comprehend
Everyday humanity dies
A void with the cruelest intentions.
Why aren't we taking what is ours?
Hours of time and devotion.
Time is of the essence.
The burning fire-brands - in every open mind
And eyes shattered - of timid fools
Madness is so strange blessing
Cold wind that cuts your flesh
We are the enemy praying for your certain death
We are what was, will be forevermore
Now, holy diver
Holy diver
Get away, get away, get away
Come on
Replacing rights with wrongs
The files and records in the schools
You say you've got the answers
Society's afraid
Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be Tenfold
And I'm waiting for a sign,
to show you that,
that this is my crime
and I know why,
I know why I can't
Confess to this,
And on trails these symphonies of agony...
I'm not a sleep
New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic
Fits through not known codes mother
No more flesh and bone
We are too unaware of what we have been before
Evolution in reverse
Now it's time for me
This world it needs a cleansing, removing all its filth.
Wearing your masks of envy but I see you still.
Madness and slaughter
gorilla maim
Say it happens all the time
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed
The day I stop to wonder
Is the day I die
From this grief and hunger
A new spirit shines
All we lost on our ways
Our souls and dignity
We will reconquer
"in the sunshine the sun is mine"
Pitiless wanderer
Close your eyes and bow your head
Grotesque thoughts in a line
Close your eyes and bow your head
Grotesque thoughts in a line
threw my wings onto the blazing sun
Smile stretched on old trees
NOWHERE TO GO 
And something grim is at hand something in this arctic land 
The Thing, No one knows the hell it will bring
We carried him in, we sang a somber song,
Less contenders on the way today
Let them pay
Any day could be the last
Never falling to oblivion
Every step leads to the knowledge
In the long way of perfection
Unreachable in a thousand lives
Starting everyday
Like the sun beneath the horizon
Choosing every move, slowly
to save me in fact until just now I was doin' just fine 
and on and on 
I know what degradation feels like
I'm Gonna cut you up
I'm Gonna kill you
Gotta bust you up
And I aint gonna give you anything
And I am gonna track you down, I guess
Confrontations 
Impulsive habitat
Judgment day the second coming arrives 
Before you see the light you must die 
Forgotten children, Conform a new faith
Fuck yeah, you have no power to ask why!
Then I will give you a turn
When talking out of your bodom mouth
Sie war so rein und voller Zier
Sie war so rein und voller Zier 
Hielt fest die Unschuld in der Hand 
Bis wir die ersten Schritte wagten 
in ein fremdes Land
It's not the petty imperfections
That define us
But the way we hold our hearts
And the way we hold our heads
Etwas Kultur muss sein!
Denn du bist, was du isst
Und ihr wisst, was es ist!
Es ist mein Teil – nein
Mein Teil – nein
Ich esse weiter unter Krämpfen
Ist doch so gut gewürzt und so schön flambiert
Und so liebevoll auf Porzellan serviert
Choose your weapons and I'll take mine
Me or you, no-one knows, we stare into death's face
Hit him right between the eyes
See the sun for the last time
Remember - make your will before you come to this place
Choose your weapons and I'll take mine
Hopeless look backward
V.A.D.E.R.
It's time to say goodbye?
Next morning his corpse was found twisted, cut and broken
The way those empty eyes stared!
Im Westen sah er Wunder, die im Osten noch niemand gesehn 
Drum wollt man ihn ermorden und er musst wieder gehn.
Within destruction, I see clearly
From here to new grounds
Suppose I will be doing it alone
With a smile through black design
Suppose I will be doing it alone
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction
Staring into truth
Die magisch ist vollendet im Triebe 
Die nicht in Gewohnheit sich ergötzt 
Die Frieden gibt und mich beschützt
Auf alle Ewigkeit sich legt
And I'm left to carry on
That still lives on after life it takes
In that one day, that changed our lives
And bitter memories are left behind
The shape of a man amidst silence and slaughter,
Clothes torn and drenched in blood and salt water.
As death came through a phantom ship!
Feiern wir ein Leben lang
Heute gilt das Jetzt
Es gilt kein Irgendwann
Auf die Liebe, die Freude,
Das Leben, heben wir an
From beyond this realm

For the spirits in their halls
Like letting the gale take you where it may

Ward off your fears
Break your harness
"Bring out the dead! Bring out the dead!"
Bring out what you will have bow down and they will bow down.
Give me your strength so I can stand so strong...
I breathe in your light and like fire my colors now light.
Still a child of tomorrow you'll be
A man full of hopes and of dreams
Dreams are destroyed easily!
So easily!
Corruption and greed
Wait my friend, you will see
Misery's coming your way
Horror and pain
It aint the way you sweat me for a handful of easy cash
It's just the way you love me when you turn to trash
Trash
And I've been cursing his day while you pray at night
So pray at night!
I just hope that you get a taste of your own,
Set this world ablaze
We alone remain
Don't fear what awaits
We alone remain
Let the skies turn black
Let the infection burn
We alone remain
Let the skies turn black
Let the infection burn
We have severed a solution
To build our foundation on natural elements to preserve life
We will rise, this Babylon.(fall)
Fall
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth ov blissful rays
And fateless eyes encourage me
The ancient dreaming
The wolf's unchained
Mr Clean'n'Safe, your governor of hell
Open up your dreams
Seven silver keys
To open up your dreams
You need seven silver keys
Sight and mind still and never go away 
One too many tantrums 
Deviated symptoms 
Better lock the phantom away 
The coat of arms falling
One too many tantrums 
Deviated symptoms 
Better lock the phantom away 
The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling
I lose myself and embrace the end
A grey so dark
A grey so dark
A grey so dark
I wonder where is this list
Give in next time
This will be a blast
Ability
It's intense
Golden
Lace, it fills the magic flies
Misunderstanding
Didn't understand
It doesn't matter
Now we're back together again
People die if he wants throne
And they fall down, down of their knees
Mercy is a world that he don't know!
Storm of the beast,
Can you really see?
We charm all jins
Automata, imprinted realities
They creep like snakes
And all we feel
Is painful bliss
As we burn forth
Enter the pylon
Thru' the galleys of past
Catacombs of night
Into the starry womb
Slay!
Making the vaginas tense as the coldness touches
To leave the female race satisfied 'til death
Hurrying taste of the feel
Hurrying taste of the feel
Of woman's lips clenched in sucking the juices
From nephilim's beings, impatient as hell itself
Tricked and cursed
Suddenly I stumble onto a forgotten sanctuary
It's the point of death's return for a grand castle there once burned
Something is following me!
Distrust kills all the kindness
Envy slain the ideal
Demise of spirit and flesh
No victory in death
Only the defeat remains
Is this the price we must pay?
In your veins now floods grubby rot
Your life depends entirely on me
traditional neglect 
reflect on how you think it would make you feel 
the cause - we're just doing it for the cause
Nothing lost
Nothing gained
Listen
Laid back and looking for symphaty
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around
She used to wear her hair short long
determine her preference
she didn't like that dynamic
tradingin her flannel shirts
She's been around a couple years
tasted 31 flavors
there's only one she really hates 
that would be you vanilla bean
For every word misspelt
For every knife that cuts you
Every rose has its thorn
To stab your heart

For every word misspelt
In another life, you'll be the one that will die
Some one and bop until the end of time
Jesus
So we lost the only thing that mattered in the end.
This friendship is slipping away
In the basement that I played house
And I felt ashamed
I'd ignored all the hands
That extended before and around me
Building grandma's bookshelf
Watched a woman walk her trash out to the street
Father alone on the highway
I heard the salt trucks
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Now lonely is my road, path paved with bitter thoughts
Conception of beauty excluded from this heart
Gonna drive you like a hammer
Opposites attract
That's the reason why
No one else could make you feel
To go,
Don't drink, too slow
Beer Bong, Beer Bong, Beer Bong, Beer Bong
If I want some beer,
I don't want to hear,
How I missed the show,
I let the bastards surround me
In unknown words massacring the mind
There is nothing after life
What we can imagine now and here
Infinitely full of posthumous nothing
Is only despair now
Caught in the waiting for nowhere
Selling the souls for oblivions price
"I must be immortal"
Listen to me carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need
Would you choose supremacy if it led to isolation?
The sound of it beating
Is the sound of the emptiness flooding in.
Flooding in... x2
It's the sound of the emptiness flooding in.
Just bodies through the teeth of the combine
At war with an enemy
Who does not rest, who will never relent
At war with an enemy
When death takes you away
For all respect you cannot lust
There is no other way
Asphxiate the world
It's blind without me
Catatonic
You like it all to be neat
I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Circle the figurative wagons and figure it's gonna be 
A long painful de-evolution that could last for decades
So fill your lungs with air and grab a weight
It's been a long time coming and well deserved
Deine Seele erhellt
Drank.....
Punk.......
Terrible monsters, nasty gnomes and mean
vampires
The lewness of millions massed
Want pull the hammer down
I cross my heart and hope to die...
I spend all my money in a fucking restaurant
I let you live in my house now woman, I take you out on the town
I treat you like shit! You love it
Smack you right in the face now baby, just to show you I care
It was DOA with millions of Dead Cops.
The latter band played faster than I could believe,
But the Songs sounded the same and kinda sucked.
The devil dances in idle minds.
Fight for your life... x3
I won't turn back now
This will be no slow surrender
For you I die
You are everything I need
What I desire
But will I ever understand?
come on
I die for you
Please forgive my faults
It's four AM
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
Close your eyes and pray the wind will take me far away
Life is like a stone behind my back of a second degree
Start
This is a death race, just another world trait of a broken system
Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread...and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
Mehr Weiber und Wein
Ich will mehr Weiber
Viele Weiber, ja das muss sein
Receive my sacrifice
my lifeblood is exhausted
no one gave love and understanding
Face...
With all your hate
With all your strength
Look at them down
Stare...
Into their eyes
Inside their mind
Dying for love
Praying to die
I want what's inside you
Rot - You are not my god
You are not my god - Not your job!
You failed, that's the only thing that I know - for sure!
You are not my god
Unholy place where the dead materialize,
In their phantom form,
To penetrate the minds of the living ones.
So I call to thee,
The day's gonna die, and will never be born again!
I beg you to come - Get away from me
And you just walk away - I have no idea who you are!
Internal organs will be splayed to find what therein lies
Unlock the secrets of the spine
Blood on the world's hands
Someone should—
Rites of death, Return to Hell
I am Satan's child, attack you with Spell
I turn the cross upside down
We want some low hangin' fruit
She wear the bee keeper suit
She got the shit-kickin' boot
We need the low hangin' fruit
We don't need nobody, baby
We don't need champagne
I'll take you to the deepest, darkest, hottest, lovers' lane
Just a little spark in the dark
Don't matter what you say
No matter what you do
Light!
Des Lebenssaft kocht in den Adern,
ein Lavastrom beginnt zu wandern.
Das Herzlein springt im rasend Takt,
ich ersehne den okkulten Akt.
and you'll soon be fearing to see what it kept us away from.
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death, oh, oh
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
What do you see and feel when you abuse me?
Don't pretend like you feel any pain
Forget about it
I have no conscience
You're too young to live this way
Just close your eyes and see
The true meaning
This is war, revenge has been sworn
--
Take your last chance
It's not the end
Take your last chance
It's not the end
--
Take your last chance
It's not the end
And wiping the haze out of these glass bulwarks;
Emptiness of Everything magnifies thy sensitivity,
Und unaufhaltsam sinke ich weiter
Und unaufhaltsam sinke ich weiter
Du helfend Herz, das Heil verspricht
Dir sehne ich entgegen
So lausche ich dem Klang
Dem Klang der Stille
Die mich bestimmt
Ein Funkeln ungehörter Liebe
Mein Kopf, mein Geist, mein Herz, so schlägt
Even the gasoline that covers you
Nadeløst du herjet i fjellene
Du tok dine seire med storm
Krigenes herre, vår far
Du hentet din styrke fra mørke
Og på tokt med deg jeg nå drar
but whether or not, 
whether or not I fall
my life is falling away (away)
handwritten letter, I'm letting you know, letting you know
my life is falling away (away)
handwritten letter, I'm letting you know, letting you know
that blood drup fell from my eyelid
that blood drup fell from my eyelid
when you're joking me down joking me down
so dethrown now, stept down from your pedestone right now
when I'm buried again you so you can't see my tears
I'm lost in this moment, but forever I'm free
Everything I left behind
I moved ahead to see what I might find
You don't like my find
Think you know me my friend
Guess again
Should every single
Thinking moment
Be saturated
With political stance
This is the aftermath in me
Tendency to keep it all
How dare you compromise
The balance of our lives
Excuses you devise
An internal suicide
Tendency to keep it all
How dare you compromise
The balance of our lives
Excuses you devise
An internal suicide
Bathe my feet amongst the Wicked.
Washing my mind in you alone.
I'll carry it out.
Your will it will be Done.
Set my black soul free!!
Blackened chariots
Bearing evil souls
Ride the surface of burning holes
Nocturnal...traveller
Like an apocrypha
Run away to the blackened sky
Through the fear and disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries
To immunity
No tear for desolation
Run away to the blackened sky
Through the fear and disbelief
We need everyone's attention!
There are words that must be said
We will never bite our tongues again
Aus deinen Tiefen die Ahnherr'n sie riefen
Hin zu dem Walde wo Götter einst schliefen
Von weit her gekommen, gefolgt deinem Hall
Aus deinen Tiefen die Ahnherr'n sie riefen
Hin zu dem Walde wo Götter einst schliefen
Die Welt ist schlecht und alle hassen mich 
Alle hassen mich 
Alle hassen mich 
Und alle hassen mich
I'm all extremes
Or in a dream
Falter to his death, off the cross defect
Common sense of need, dead philosophy
I don't need your love, Smite the lord above
Crucified for the innocence, truth cannot be seen
Crucified for the innocence, You are dead to me
Mirror, mirror...
Tell me who's that man, that's staring back at me
Master the Mights
Sail with me across the raging sea
Write your tale into eternity
Still we've sighted only sea till now
Under stormy skies through rain, wind and raging sea
Head into the Unknown, leave behind.
Ver sterk mín sál á mjørkantungu ferð
Har tættar fylkjast um teg gráar gátur
Tín barnaflokkur - úttærdur hann er,
Ver sterk mín sál á køldu náttarvakt
Har eingi altarjós til gudar brenna
Always we got by on our own.
Under stormy skies through rain, wind and raging sea
Head into the Unknown, leave behind.
Sail with me across the raging sea
Write your tale into eternity
How I longed for far far away
Rise to meet the day hold high torches passed through time.
Fear not what you might find.
But unfortunately still asleep
You may put your hands before your eyes
But its gleam it's neverending
How much you turn it inside out
I touch your legs, so cold, make me cold in the light
And I burn now, no pain
Your pain seems so far away
You say so, I am invading vision, satisfy
Once I look back, so miracle
Down...
Feed the hungry, feed them shit, feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize? Be specific and believe your eyes!
and we will burn your cities down
America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
No longer mine
They are for you
When you come
Being alive
We would be forced to look
We condemn your soul and fate
Nothing can stop us, it's head over heel
United together we stand
If it's too hard, then you're too weak
That is a hellrider's way
Engines are running, our blood burns like oil
Head one by one down the highway
After the Holocaust!
One can only wander now
If they'll make the same mistake
After the Holocaust!
After the Holocaust!
As I stood, before this circle, I call upon the creatures of the night...
Murphy's Law cuts down - everything to the ground
Strangulated pride
Pounding pain - will my soul remain?
Strangulated pride - purgatory
Running dry!
Betrayed by many names - they are playing games
Purgatory!
The worms are eating up her face
Our casket home walls warp
That bitch left me to rot alone again
They took me off the conveyer belt- and put me in a box on a shelf
Then came the day my little cardboard home and I
She threw her arm around me saying "Andy, I love ya still."
Oh, she's one Miss Fayes O'Bailey, the pride of Fairmount Hill
The young, the old, the brave and the bold came a duty to fulfill
At the parish church of Thatcher, a mile from Fairmount Hill
Forever you’ll remain remembered, within our hearts as your body decays from this disease
We're all just waves in the ocean, we break but we will remain
My soul is still bleeding as the hope begins to fade
Close to ending it all I am drifting through the stages of the rapture born within
Should contemplate this change 
To ease the pain 
And I
Should step out of the rain 
Turn away 
At times the
But it never
With their rights, die!
Your world, with permanent thoughts of hate,
Realize the point is,
The pain comes,
The body's fresh,
You're killing for me!
A blackened carcass / A land of ash 
Persepolis / You lost your crown 
Persepolis / Burned to the ground
Flutes and pipes / Play a drunken rhyme 
Entertaining / The soldiers in the palace 
Naked bodies / Female slaves from Asia
Wisdom dressed in blackest array
There is no man in that tower
Walking the shores in black
Bitter frost now bite the walls of hope
Hand in hand with the wisdom of stars
Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near
Excitation
My rancid passion is electrified
A lament for a rookie officer
Punk ass weak little lamb
Immune, stronger than all
A lament for a rookie officer
Punk ass weak little lamb
For the mob, truly
Does rule at this particular time
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into obivion
This Time Is For Real
Make No mistake
Driven By Spite
Burning To Rise
And Disprove All
Who Would Take Comfort
In our Demise
No one know's, if I'm good or bad !!
I'm back
You'll see your own dead body
I'm back
I'm angry and bloody !!
You cannot stop me, man.
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe
So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Red burning evil eyes
Lord's prayer holy water
Just faith can save you now
Disharmony, satanic serenade
Just faith can save you now
Disharmony, satanic serenade
The twisted souls awakened by the chanting
Als Kraft und Licht das ander enthalten ist - ist es auch
Black knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black Shadows of Mordor
Wield One-Eye shields
Black Knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black Shadows of Mordor
Wield One-Eye shields
Black Knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black Shadows of Mordor
Only the lifestream can heal this wound
Take me away on a highwind
I'm under your wing, I'm in your command
I've reached as far as I can go
Only the lifestream can heal this wound
Take me away on a highwind
I'm under your wing, I'm in your command
Life's lessons taught you to be cruel and mean
All your prayers are said in vain
You live by the blade, die by the same
DIE IN PAIN!!
Tearing pain is flowing down your arms, sweet, red, warm,
stream I drink to make you realeased
Holding your arms cherish this composure
I feel the fire burning in my eyes 
I see it sparkling in your eyes
Dead to all.
Fighting as you're slowly rotting in hell.
Fighting as you slowly read in your love.
Fighting the sword.
The sword is your plow.
Dead to all.
Lesions fighting love.
Fight them all in a living hell.
Slowly rot and you die.
You fight death as you slowly realize.
Kill them all.
Lesions fighting love.
Fight them all in a living hell.
Slowly rot and you die.
You fight death as you slowly realize.
Lost, ran at my own cost
Despise, despise

Cut me, show me
Enter I am
Willing and able
And never any danger to myself
Wondering if it's ever going to end
Your bored all the time with the things that you do
I don't pity your life
I see your acting all weird
(Chorus:)
So like millions before
He died in his gore
And those who survived
His yell pierced the cold frosty mornin'
As he erased someone wicked with evil
(Chorus:)
Tomorrow shuts eyes ashamed what it sees
Whole ground is painted by decease
Sparks from stones above mortal lands
The anvil of forgotten roars demanding loud
The land of forgotten aside gods once again
Minderknilchschitte
Der Friseusenkasper:
"Nein, meine Friseuse fick ich nicht" - "ach komm"
Increase coldness
Increase ignorance
Lass mich nicht allein.
Mit mir zerschellen dir Träume,
Ich heb' die Trümmer auf.
Ob tot oder lebendig;
Ich will wieder hinauf.
Ins kalte Grab.
Hast Du bei einem Verlierer
Wie mir geglaubt,
Dass mir ein Dolchstoß wie dieser
Den Willen raubt?
Hör mir zu:
That’s when you'll see your nothing to me. You're nothing to anyone, and you never will be
All the rage of the slayer unfolds as King Minos

Calls the flesh, tribute of souls!
On the stone lay the fourteen!
Calls the flesh, tribute of souls!
Existence and what's after the end is unclear
Religion, turn from reason and live without fear
Oblivion, logic tells us that nothing awaits
Miracles and the wonder of a child
Superstition and the outsider reviled
Brave men venture into vast new fields
Oblivion, logic tells us that nothing awaits
The answer, is it worth what the question creates
Go and ask the scientist
Superstition and the outsider reviled
Brave men venture into vast new fields
Future dawns and new miracles revealed
And mankind will construct his own heaven thereby
And just through this
You might escape this prophecy
Third war is near. We'll see the seas of blood
It is the precedence of the real Ungod
Prepare to die and pray, if you believe in prophecy
die Zeiten rückwärts drehen,
noch einmal deine Nähe spürn,
und zuhörn und verstehn...
Wenn Tage kommen, gehen sie,
And as I turn around
Nothing is to be found
I'm breaking you down, crack by crack
Yeah you're the one that feeds me
And when you die, I will still be
(REPEAT 2.)
(REPEAT C.)
I wanna tie you up with some garden hose 
Slap your tits and rub my balls on your nose 
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Sentenced to death by the second law
Hellbent for destruction
Incineration - no rapture
Spires of doom, gorges of death
Gas and smoke drawn into your lungs as you slowly asphyxiate
[Intro]
Still offers a smile to the world betrayed...
Always close to the drop
Disapear with yesterday
Cure this dream that makes me fall
Bin ich auf die Liebe greiser Frauen versessen – je älter, je besser
Denn seh ich schneeweißes Haar, ja, dann lauf ich Gefahr
Mich vor Liebe und Sehnsucht fast zu vergessen
I am the one, Orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand
My image is of agony, my servants rape the land
I march before a martyred world, an army for the fight
Watch the lump under your skin 
Guess who's living within
Me the parasite inside your skin
You the host that takes me in
Me the parasite inside your skin
You the host that takes me in 
Me the parasite inside your skin
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head
 
Years and years of
Circulos obscurus
The broken mountain -- hell on earth
The broken mountain -- procession of Sathan
Walpurgis rites
Circulos obscurus
Your lord...Jesus Christ
Your lord...Born of sin
Is the mirror of yourself
Wander to the pyres we've prepared
Malignant seed... Flourish within
Awake and breate...The scourge of blasphemy
Realize the truth as you begin to burn
Your lord...Jesus Christ
Saviour to none...Failure for all
Coward...Would be his name
She paints them only as they are
From the darkest corners of the mind as real
as the morning sun shall rise, just the same
Harming without stint or cease at the expense of whosoever may be
Their pain becomes your paradise, your lust their demise
Unearthing fantasies too savage to reveal
Twisting your world with visions centuries concealed
Was he philosopher or was he just insane?
We serve her as we sin
as the morning sun shall rise, just the same
lost in a maze, in a dreamless embrace
oblivion - the tomb of our three fates
From frozen cliffs and wings of lead and we find ourselves
Leave the house
What a sound
As much pent up energy
Like tgv
Precise as a tornado
Doesn't know where's his front
And where's his ass
Loaded like a nuclear head
Filed up to the top
Muscles like a football player
Blind as v1
Doesn't know where to hit
My thoughts of the fading you
Reach through, make you
Mold myself for two
My thoughts of the fading you
Reach through, make you
Mold myself for two I cry for the bleeding...whore
Failure
My dream had come true
Look back, don't crack
Your stares are empty now
I am still here I won't crack
It's all coming back
My thoughts of the fading you
Reach through, make you
Mold myself for two
I cry for the bleeding...whore
Loss of feeling now I take the pain
Step by step, by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step, by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step, by step
It just don't stop
Rejected, lost in a daze
It's all so cold, do as you're told
Nämlich Deinen Namen buchstabiert!
Das ist Liebe!
Wenn die Sonne auf der Haut gefriert!
Das ist Liebe!
Wenn der Kopf nur noch den einen,
Nämlich Deinen Namen buchstabiert!
Das ist Liebe!
From all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve
When you think about death do you lose your breath 
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope
Stormbringer cries:
"The ending has begun"
Ref.: Run...
are hiding in the dark
needing Elric's hand
Stormbringer cries:
"I'm forged in darkest time"
Stormbringer cries:
"The ending has begun"
they'll bless tonight
he's the Saviour of our time
In a dark land far behind
no one knows it's name
there's a dark sword cold as ice
Not to cry no more. 
To fly no more. 
Did you ever ask the stars? 
Not to shine no more. 
To fly no more.
To fly no more. 
Did you ever think that we would still remain together for so long? 
Is it what we wanted all along?
What would you ask if you had just one question?
And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, God is good
No one, can even understand, what you have been through,
once this is all over we’ll run away,
Even though you're not always around, just remember this one thing
To men that mix and meet her,
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked
Evolution has been recalled
Beneath the spread of a Magickal Aeon
In the arms of the ancient oak
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
Where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
And the horned, hidden one is re-invoked
Evolution has been recalled
Who gathers all things mortal,
With cold immortal hands,
This is the end of existence beware
I've found a way, never stalling, always
Searching for the sword of darkness

I feel its power pulling at my soul
I see it through, see it through the light
I'll search for the sword of darkness
I've found a way, never stalling, always
Butt no weights gonna stop all of us from standing
old ties made strong from the years that passed by 
Our dreams seem so vivid now 
reaching out for a taste of a new beginning
Selbst zwischen tausend Sonnen
Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,
Ein Schein, der mich
Auf allen Wegen führt.
Die Netze sind gesponnen,
Denn Deine Hand
Hat meine Haut berührt.
Der Seele nah, dem Körper fern,
Auf einem abgeleg'nen Stern
Betrachten wir den Feuerball
Eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
Who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
"I am as dusk come to ravish the light"
die with such tragedy
and those interred in cold graves
dwell on pleasures to be....
and those interred in cold graves
How you've decayed
It must be so lonely
By yourself 
Verbal grenades
Reality! my fault, as i cut you deep. My deacon knows as i cut you with this knive.
??? ??? ??? ??? ???
A LEADER IN MY HAGGARD DREAMS
EMOTIONS OF A FOOL
NO WAY OUT
I'M SPOILING YOU WITH MY PRURIENCE
MY SADNESS DISAPPEARS
i'm about to lose control,
LOSE CONTROL,
AND WHO IS HELD RESPONSIBLE?
i want to know.
I'M ABOUT TO LOSE CONTROL!
Sur mon crâne incliné plante son drapeau noir.
Et de longs corbillards, sans tambours ni musique,
Qui se mettent à geindre opiniâtrement.
Et de longs corbillards, sans tambours ni musique,
Défilent lentement dans mon âme; l'Espoir,
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Political tyranny exercised by morbid despots
When prohibition means salvation
I mourn the day I could live without
This gasoline that makes me live!
So many voices in my head
Walk side by side...
This asylum I' ll stay in
Til' the day I'll be clean
From my blood to my soul
Suffering and substitution
I stand and fight
I'm not afraid to die
Elochai, bury me tonight
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
All I want to do is tantalise you
And I can tell by your state
He played his part to the end
Shot...leaving a shambles
But I read in his eyes
Promotion...reality
He played his part to the end
Shot...leaving a shambles
To be in league with workers
Pictures he loved to see
But I read in his eyes
Promotion...reality
He played his part to the end
For the most inhumane crimes,
But when the bombs go off again,
And you all thought that he was dead,
A sentinel rises to proceed the chaos,
Chaos to make, a world to break,
But I see a dead world at sunrise, a dead world at sunrise
And nothing can reverse the state.
We are still one.
Oh yes, I'm back
They are there, silent...
They listen, silent though they listen. x2
But I see a dead world at sunrise, a dead world at sunrise
Their faces left, I'm longing for death, I'm in torture, torture...
It's all that's left of my memories.
I just would like to let you know
Spinning around
Spitting and laughing in my face
Spinning around
Spitting and what I found were alarm clocks
See the division of pathes
wich decides about your divine ordinance
feeling a certain coldness
of a secret power that entangles the spirit
Longing for the meaning of life
Remember to breathe as it gets colder
Remember to write as you get older
Are you happy as your smile shows?
(To make this never go away)
Godfeared downfall
The deviants march
Resist

Violent increase
Their wings full with rage
Congregation battleclad
Prepared for the siege
Godfeared downfall
The deviants march
Resist

Violent increase
Never trust in the motives of man
Take this sense of wonder
Make it go away
Please give me something that's familiar
A friendly touch, a memorable embrace
Please tell me I am not alone and lost here
That there is something that made me feel
this way
Take this sense of sadness
Make it go away
Red nails and lipstick 
dressed two sizes two tight 
His tongue down your throat 
His hand up your skirt 
Yeah I'm a man
Don't even try 
To sort out the lies
It's worse to try to understand 
You, you make me hate myself 
I know you're fucking someone else 
He knows you're fucking someone else
He knows you're fucking someone else 
I know you're fucking someone else 
He knows you're fucking someone else 
You had cock on your mind
Drinking alone 
Empty bottle in your hand 
Don't even try 
To sort out the lies 
It's worse to try to understand
And cum on your breath 
Inserted that diaphragm before you left 
Practicing freelance gynecology 
Where there's a womb there's a way
As the pain eats us slowly from inside
On winds of death we ride
Feed the hunger that never dies -
The flesh needs to be satisfied
DER DRUCK DER MEINE LUNGE SPRENGT
DOCH FRAGEND FUHLE ICH ANGST ERKLINGEN
OB HOFFUNG SICH MIT GLUCK VERMENGT
ES WIRD MIR KLAR AN DIESEM TAGE
OFFNET SICH DIE GESUCHTE TUR
DENN DIESE ANTWORTEN SAMT DER FRAGEN
SCHLAFEN GANZ FEST UND TIEF IN MIR
I question every part of who I am
I question every part of who I am
Bleeding under cruel suns in Villers-Bocage
Maybach engines roar through the Ardennes
All barrels pointing towards the east
Sowing a wind - harvesting a storm
Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Faith in weapons yet to come
Crises the skeleton key cant unlock
Faith in victories yet unseen
Spring awakening flares up, reality unfolds
Ferociously marching through the Balkans
All barrels pointing towards the east
Death's head and oak-leaves; doomsday elite
Beneath those carnal veils 
Rejoice as emptyness grow thicker 
Feel it's grasp around your neck 
The hour has come to release
For what dwells behind those flames 
Is hidden for your eyes 
And just one single glance 
Would transform your smiles into cries
I'm bursting open while you set the tone
You ignored this fury too long, I explode
Bring back to life this anger, let it grow
Bring back to life this anger, let it grow
Put aside mind traps and false beliefs
These heavy weights created pull you down
Mortals dwell in fear
Dead walks from their graves
The gathering is here
Never will die
All within  the abyss
Incense fills the cave
Snake
I am the snake
Tempting
That bite to take

Let me make your mind
To free the you that's running through
Those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you that's running through
The more I give the more you take away
Now who am I to express and complain, that this is killing me?
It never matters
Now who am I to express and complain, that this is killing me?
It never matters
I said it once and ill say it all again
Most days I feel like your punching bag, but I will never let it hold me back.
You fall face down at the sight of yousrelf
No one to pick you up
Look what our lives have become
It's about time we all get out and vote for love
It's about time we all get out and vote for love
Time to claim it back
It's about time we all get out and vote for love
It's about time we all get out and vote for love
No light's shining in out eyes
We've painted all doors bible black
I'm on call to be somewhere.
Somewhere I'm not.
In case the cleaning lady has found my head.
Waving to the families of victims of the flood.
Straddling the front door of a Catholic orphanage.
I decorated it myself.
Don't lie to me, 'cause memories
One day will come together
We all know that
Time is the worst enemy of men
runs fast and never comes back
and even though we think to be free
There is no way out
to makes things clear, to explain how I felt
The time we wasted left it's mark on me
That no one will ever erase...
Until the day I die
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
If you're a charter member of the NRA, you're wrong
You're wrong if you support capital punishment
when i'm wiser and i'm older
all this time I was finding myself
and I... didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost
all this time i was finding myself
and I... didn't know I was lost I tried carrying the weight of the world
but I only have two hands
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
here's to you and taking the easy way out!
but waves are crashing in and we are drowning by the minute.
do you have a hand to hold on to?
I wanna be the christ who dies 
upon the fires
how black your future will be
Disgrace, regret - to trigger an endless
Process of purification
Shadows of the past

Shadows of this darkest chapter
I ask no more
A life has just begun
Never will I see the sun
And do I miss it?
No, my eyes are black
Sechs
Hier kommt die Sonne
Sieben
Sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Now he has left for the stars
He has left us to play bars

Get up!
Think fast!
The beast of the savage lands
They drink my blood
A vanquised lord upon an oaken throne
Grief inside my flame - grasp at my existance
The seal of dawn is broken - fury
Wildfire
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
You are the temptress that blinded me
I hate this conflicted condescending life. I strive to be free
"You son of a whore should be terrified! In this hell I'll wait for you!"
And right before I step on that mine I ask myself: "did he just spoke the truth?"
Die schwersten Stunden steh'n bevor
Doch Sieg wir haben uns geschwor'n
Ganz gleich wie schwer mag sein die Zeit
has flipped the bitch on evolution
the benevolent and wise are being quieted, ostracized, what a bummer
the world keeps getting dumber
the fittest are surviving much less often
now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening
Stop your eyes from flowing
Psycho, groupie, cocaine, crazy
Psycho, groupie, cocaine, crazy
Psycho, groupie, coke
So you want the world to stop
Stop in and watch your body fully drop
From the time you were a
Psycho, groupie, cocaine, crazy
Then your journeyman's day has begun
I know what I want, And I say what I want
And no one can take it away, I know what I want
Deeper grey, came to mourn, all the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last
Do not grieve, end the suffering
We will live, live eternal
Will you take the stand among the dead?
Bury your fear, and hold fast to life
Won't be beaten down 
 Have the answers 
 Take the pressure 
 Turn it all around 
Lift me up above this, the flames and the ashes
Is that all that you got? Because I ain't got all day! 
 Won't be broken 
 Won't be tortured 
 Won't be beaten down 
 Have the answers
Take the pressure 
 Turn it all around 
Lift me up above this, the flames and the ashes 
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Have the answers 
 Take the pressure
I need to find something to blame for a long lost time 
I am running from something, I don't know
Have we lost the spark or a guide?
His eyes are on fire
Beinahe das Leben mich umgebracht
Ich suche den Funken im Dunkel der Nacht
Der das Feuer das einst brannte wieder entfacht.
There's something wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with me
There's something wrong with you
There's something wrong with me
and crush it(break you down) 
but you dont know 
because nobody know 
because nobody cares 
because nobody tries
We'll bring you to hell because we want to enslave
We'll bring you to hell because we want to enslave
Soul will be frozen with fright
We'll break through the crust, leave from our crypts
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade
will mislead all those that read.
Buried in the lines of text are the myths that feed their needs.
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge
To make my hallowed point
The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Disperesed on excursions
Half Life - 4.5 Billion
Half Life - You'll waste a...
We've heard their lies before and we know they're lying again
And we move by instinct, darling
Let our eyes
Gears are working monotonously
Systems work continuously, but nobody knows
How long?
This is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world
All right!
It was the greatest song in the world
All right!
I know exactly what you are
God speaks to me too, from afar
Yes, I predict
The death of one Harold Camping
Halleluja, resurrection
Resurrection
Uh, ah, resurrection
Uh, ah, resurrection
Now I want my resurrection
All my live for resurrection
Fühlt ihr mich?
Hört ihr mich?
I don't care—100 ways to hate
I gave you a million chances
You gave me a hundred ways to hate
A hundred ways
Hate your face—hate your lies—hate the blank look in your eyes
Hate your needs—hate your wants—hate the way you love to taunt
Than the Midwest or the Middle East like to preach
I shamefully disturb you
My relentless knocking is constantly ignored
I can narrowly overhear your serene breathing anymore
Wir scheißen auf die Sperrstunde und haun noch einen drauf
Ist die Leber auch am Stöhnen
Und die Galle kommt heraus
Saufen
Saufen, Saufen, Jeden Tag nur Saufen
Saufen, Saufen, Jeden Tag nur Saufen
Saufen, Saufen, Jeden Tag nur Saufen
Saufen
Gloria, ein neuer Tag, ein neues Jahr,
Härter als jemals zuvor, entern wir Dein Ohr
Gloria, ein neuer Tag, ein neues Jahr,
Non-physical smothering. Asphyxiation by oxygen hands
Drowning in the endless sky. An ever-downward dive, only to surface
Polished metal gleams
Deadly weapons in the hands of beasts
Another martyr screams
Will the path be easy?
Nothing is easy, but that's reality
For the sake of my loved ones
I will remain on this earth
Where I know I'm not dreaming now
But I know I've been sleeping
I just don't know since when
I only know that it's light outside
Hmm, hmm, hmm,...
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!
Jeder lebt so vor sich hin, in seiner eigenen Welt, 
Jeder kämpft für sein Glück oder was er dafür hält.
Spending all your life treading over all the ones you love.
You have me calling for the last time and by the dawn, I will rise again!
Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?
Your question your beliefs, your inner thoughts,
your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
Plead no more
There's no confusing the finale
Excitation
All the motions of ordinary love
All the motions of ordinary love
As the innocent take the punishment
That was really meant for every one of you
Came immunity from the misery
I can feel it growing inside me
I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak (I would never dare speak)
These journeys are filled with craving, these moments with loss
Neither the glittering dew on moors, nor the the whispering wind in dales
Come on, get down
A sardine in a can
People taking notes
People in white coats
I'm a sick boy
I'm a sick boy - there should be more
I'm a sick boy
Just a sick boy
I'm a sick boy
There's assholes everywhere
Plus girls with big town hair
But why must I suffer
Hell is from here to eternity
She must be having one of her
crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
Always trusting holy rule
Death is your saviour
Spread fear across the sea
Kill yourself to be free
The only commander of the world
He lived by his sword
Till he died
Mighty wargod fight till death
Hunt the people let no one rest
Show your planet who is the lord
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me
I won't stop until this is through
And I can't wait to see the sun rise again
It's moments like this
I'm what you'll never be
Doch wird sie versiegen, im Sande der Erkenntniss
Doch wird sie versiegen, im Sande der Erkenntniss
You may think you're god
but I know that I. M. Sin
I. M. Sin
I. M. Sin
I. M. Sin
I. M. Sin
I won't fucking buy it
Keep your focus unbroken
Take refuge in these words
There comes a day for retribution
Through the loneliness and depression
Take refuge in these words
There comes a day for retribution
Through the loneliness and depression
This is not in vain
keep the faith
you know where you belong
Lace, it fills the magic flies
Armies are arrayed
To your egos past
There was a day when I could forget
I could forgive but those days are gone
I see them fade
Filth runs in every new day
Black walls of waves pummel to capsize
The roaring thunder overshadows our cries
Spires of lightning thrown down from the gods
Torrential rain at the helm of death
It drowns the weak, battering the rest
Black walls of waves pummel to capsize
cleanse me impure 'til the doctrine sticks.
Super-focused - fields of red to dredge.
Ultra-conscious - earmarked? devil? in your wake.
Win the battle lose the war
I look to my horizon
I see nothing
While thoughts of guns and desecration
Sweep through my mind
But only coffins and bones remain
Calm my franticness, I can't take it anymore
I wonder what I'll find, I wonder
I wonder what I'll find, I wonder
She answered with faith
In her god and carried on, while
He was attacked
By his son and was stabbed
In his stomach and his back
Still, your jealousy precedes you
Don't fuck with this 
Break every bone in your face 
If you mess with my life 
I'll mess with your blood
Thinkin' 'bout a couple things to say to you
Showin', growin'
Man I'd like to place my hand upon your fuckin' sexy ass and squeeze
Hide so far from truth
Blood floweth
Crawl into unknown
Does time heal all wounds?
Why's this been so long?
Line of descent gone
They froze my blood and changed my soul
The master has spoken, the truth, not any lies
The Devil gives and evil takes
Away goes my hope
I cried for the ones I lost
Hear my prayers
Ein kleiner Schritt
In eine größere Welt
Wir sind das Licht
das in Finsternis
Deine Seele erhellt
Grip on reality fades out day by day
no escape - you're a victim of the unholy wrath
Screams from depths of mind
cry of mutilated souls
tyrant drops from scratched wounds of God
Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
Dein Licht
Wollte mich sodann ergeben in des Schicksals Schlund
Da mahnte mich an's Leben eines Engels Mund
And venom of the evil gods
Through the caverns of the earth the creep
Still waiting for the right time
They revolt against the holiness
(Innervision) There's only one true path in life
(Innervision) The road that leads to all
Innervision
My speech it has no value
Eyes that have seen the sights
Bleed through the ages eternal
I ask no more
A life has just begun
Multinational corporations
Genocide of the starving nation
you try to stand against them and you'll end up dead
as your front door is smashed in by the atf
Police state in the usa
Komm sei dabei,
Heut werden Helden geboren.
Komm sei dabei,
Heute werden Helden geboren.
Trouble on the double's what it b-b-b-b-bring bring
They were born of atomic steel
We'll give you merciless
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
Lava flow
Eyes close in the eye of the storm
The silence is breath taking in the eye of the storm
Substances join
Togther immortal
Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king
Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king
Go go go go go go dancer (x3)
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates
Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
Ignite the past.
For the ones who never listened.
For the ones who failed in trying.
It goes "you ain't a shakin till the shit shot, shoot it up
No one jammin' til the gin juice jigger jets
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
Your morning begins with you thinkin':
"One more day in this job and I'm gonna scream!"
So stand up
Peace sells... but who's buying?
Peace sells... but who's buying?
Die Liebende treibt
-Kvifor ikkje leva
Utan dei?
I sirklar går rika
Frå anna til eit går me
Det endelege blå
Ikring ei nådelaus mor
Som skal
Fyller det tenkande
Rom; tvihald om
(Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Touch me there, yeah
My, my (Yeah), touch me (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
My, my, my, my, yeah, yeah
still with a lust for death
Vandrer nå som mørkets slave - glemt og fortapt
Mitt kjøtt fryser til is mens min sjel vandrer
og deres sjel og blod herdes
Nattravnens tokt vil komme
når dagen er omme
Hill min død - i skogens favn
So much for suicide - Lots of talk but you never tried
A few pills short of a straight line - Waking up still feeling fine
You know the mindset's a threat
(You! Know!)
Me say the mindset's a threat
Lyrical Champion ah, this Lyrical Champion ah, Lyrical Champion
Me say the mindset's a threat
(You! Know!)
The shock of recognition now
I will die
Mind distortion weird thoughts
Tell me why...
I'm going insane...
Final hour
The one that got me out of the grave
Always there
Don't know what he's aiming at
Do not dare
Never regain...
Tapping the vein
they run from the fire in my eyes
nothing can save them now
you've learned a lesson in violence
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to live
Metal Punk - Feel it
Metal Punk - C'mon
Metal Punk - Take it
Metal Punk
Metal Punk
When I have nothing to say
I am only trying to complete this song
In the closet deep inside
And Why do you hear these words
When I have nothing to say
I am only trying to complete this song
I am only trying to complete this song
You know you've never seen a love like this...
Buried inside where I can't see.
Through these bars my future lies.
That's what they get, we're even now!
Let's walk away.
Don't close your eyes, it will all pass you by
You love this life, but not through my eyes.
Where I can't see
Our time is up, no not that!
Das vor allen Spiegeln?
Ich habe Dich die ganze Nacht gesucht,
Das letzte Mal hast Du gelobt zu bleiben,
Wie oft hab' ich den Augenblick verflucht,
Oh, Anneliese, mein Nachbarskind, du bist immer so gut drauf
...Es pflückt Blumen und die bringt es
Seiner Mutter in die Küche
Anneliese Schmidt...
Manchmal denk ich, es wäre schön
Pueblos nativos del suelo mío
estan viciados y confundidos.
Auch wenn ich daran sterben muss
Luciferian - Slave to the beast and marked for life
Order from Hell - To send souls to the other side
The Dagger Strikes - Blood is shed for the faceless one
Possessed with Murder - Angels of death amphetamine sped
Von oben sah die Erde überwältigend aus
Das Flugzeug stürzte ab und die Welt war entsetzt
Wo ist Buddy Hollys Brille jetzt?
Es hieß, man könne singen, wenn man sie trage
Viele Schurken waren deshalb hinter ihr her
Pirate space kingdom
We get lost
In this chaos
Too soon for us
Lacerate the heavens
Devour the sun - rape the light
Blinding blackness
Blood of angels stains the torrid soil
Eternal fury - celestial genocide
Hellstorms over empires divine
Blinding blackness
Can hear the bell toll
So weak
They said they'd be placing roses on his grave but Franky's gonna be alright
He swore to show them outlast them all and someday they would see him standing tall
FOR THEY ARE MY SOLDIERS WHO SOON SHALL BE FED.
Yeah!
And tear away at the restraints they call the body
It's the temporary things that rip us apart
But I grew to be something that I'm not
It feels like I'm cornered
By everything that you really want
We just need to ride out this storm
These sleepless nights are killing me
What awaits me in my decrepit dream
Aversion and despondency (scarification, monotonously)
Release me from this nightmare
little did he know, England was close to ruin,
The nine year war in Ireland almost brought them to their doom.
O'Neil's men surrendered as famine gripped the land,
He received clemency when he relinquished his command.
Attacked by English cavalry - the Spanish surrendered then.
To Ulster they retreated but their campaign began to falter,
'Cause I'm goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line
Goin' down the steps on a white line
They said son you're gonna be a new man
I said thank you very much and
Can I borrow fifty bucks?
Virginia death threat
Virginia creeper vine
The hands that feed intent
Choke the purpose of this time
Take all that you can give
Guardians fo the lost faith
Destined for glory?
Watch them all turn into sand
And the wind blow them away
Standing at the bridge of destiny
So long since I tasted fear
Lurking in the darkest holes
Awaiting my minds weakest moment
I am my own worst enemy
Unleash the trapped souls of the dead
Spirits since long forgotten
Guardians fo the lost faith
Destined for glory?
My inner demons torture me
Flapping their wings in my face
Damn you! You twisted illusion
some more unlight
and i'll show you how to eat a scythe
throatkickin' bladefood at astrospeed
with a tombwormsmile
ink to rain and rain to ink
all planetflesh to poisonsoil
down the sunpus course
for a word of all that never was
Can't take the fuckin' pain.
A shell without a star
At the end of time

Watch the bend of my wandering
Of hunting with the lightning gun
Ages of delirium
Tremor on my heaven son
Tares above my kingdom come
Find your way out from the constant lack
Your pride is just a symbol
Another hidden excuse
For being such a savior
Jag vill göra slut på mig själv
Min kropp värker, skakar och stinker
Ärrad av åratal av den svartaste dyrkan
Er wird zu seiner Tochter gehen
Sie ist schön und jung an Jahren
Und dann wird er wie ein Hund
Mit eigen Fleisch und Blut sich paaren
And drunk I was when they caught me
Yes, you see I need you, so I can snuff the meek
Savor the silence - Whargoul
Far away from me

Stay never
Taking yourself and the others
Arrested outside, in a psychologic jail

No matter how you do
There are several ways to
Hell eve hate
The world outside's so big but I'm safe in my domain
'Cause to you I'm just a number and a clever screen name
'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away
I love my computer, you're always in the mood
Inga elenda ugjort da svir
Bøtast da mao prisen e sæle
Dyrt da e å herja kristna land med eld
Ikkje vil eg bera kongsnamn i slik eit land
Dar lausungar kreve krunao
med våpen i hand
Da e uvandt i å skifta mat åt hund og ramn
Dar lausungar kreve krunao
med våpen i hand
Da e uvandt i å skifta mat åt hund og ramn
Ilske gjerningar samvitet hans rir
Fuck the sterling, I'll take the gold
I've been here too many times before
Auf dem Balkon hab ich es gut
Und schau, was ihr da unten alles tut.
Ich hab eh nicht mehr lange
In diesem irdischen Jammertal.
Von Felix und Thorsten.
Alexander killt Thorsten und Felix
Und wird erschossen.
Zum Glück bin ich ein alter Mann:
There's no need to pray
I got the order  Kill 'em all
Hannibal  prepares you for the meal
Did you make me strong
Yes you make me strong
Nobody else but you could have the power
To make me so strong
Fire through the sky, thunder, power shakes the earth
Shadows siege the night, ancient spirits attack
Ender med døden
Dør med enden
We learned the human mind 
To satisfy our wicked way 
A silhouette of the beast
We create what man hate 
"I tempt you" 
Knowledge is like a looping tower 
Inside a golden pillar
To reach for the Lantern of Might 
Through the centuries of hidden knowledge 
I've learned the weakness of man 
Feeding on their lusts
That came from another dimension 
We wore the sign of Utukku 
The sign of the ancient curse 
He bore the sign of Akrabu
Deeper than the deepest mind 
"Rub the lantern! 
Rub it now!"
Kann mich nicht beherrschen, voll abgefuckt
Ich dreh am Rad im 3/4-Takt
Komm und tanze, tanze mit mir
Ave occult spirit - nocturnal divinity Extol the crown of silver filigree filaments, spun by ritualistic deeds.
If we wouldn´t need a good advice
We´d let the dice decide
If we´d drink alcohol all day we could write like Hemingway
We all don´t believe in ifs
Damn right
If we´d change everything we are
We all could be superstars
If we wouldn´t need a good advice
Come forth to me
And help me seize
(Come to me...Black Goddess arise)
To plot the new age's decline
Lilith who rode the steed
Ishtar my Queen
Come forth to me
And help me seize
My future from the House of Death
That in the release of immortality
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
You've got your gun to my head
(I regret)

This all was only wishful thinkin'
(Is that I)
This all was only wishful thinkin'
And now something
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me
If I'm already gone
A feeling so insecure
Caught in the circle of addiction
A silent scream is piercing
You need to kill the pain
Piercing through your vein
Hungry for heaven
You're hungry for heaven
Oh hungry for heaven
So hungry for heaven
You're hungry for heaven
So hungry for heaven
Hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
Death - came to me on a somber morning
Nú þegar sakna þín og kveð þig ástin mín.
Ég reyni að standa beinn, en veit ég enda einn.
Hvar ertu nú? Ég finn þig ekki hér.
Ég sit við síðu þér, hitinn enginn er.
En allt mun skilja við, dauðans hinsta sið.
Verðið er svo hátt, með hjartað upp á gátt.
Hið beiska heiftarþel, mig sjálfan ávallt kvel.
We've got guitars 
We'll go to war
We'll go to war
GWAR! GWAR! GWAR! GWAR!
Gwar! Gwar! Gwar!
Gwar! Gwar! GWAAAAAAAR!
No longer inferno
On earth I will stay
Still the night devours
Each and every inch of pain
No longer dressed in soil
A guardian of the black and the cold
Duping the masses. So fucking what.
You get what you give - I can see it now.
Look into the eyes of a madman
You can see it in his face, he's a weak and sad man
Staring straight ahead, his eyes set like stone
That's what you get for living like this
With a bullet in your head - you're dead, you can't miss
So all hail the new flesh
'Cause it suits me fine
Hey man, I'm gonna fuck this shit up
No fear, no compromise -- I want it all
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plane
The rain in Spain
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plane
Listen so many times I've heard their cries
All the disappointment and all the lies
There's something about it something they want
Unto you I whisper
The wildest dreams
