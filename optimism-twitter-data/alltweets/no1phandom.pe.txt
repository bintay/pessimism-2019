@TheVampsband #TheVampsVIP meeeee!!!!!?????????????//
@TomJosephLaw i agree, or long train  journeys that either go through amazing sunsets or sunrises.
i've given up the history homeork is too hard. Listening to the #ymas10 doccumentary!
@al_awesome123 did let the road arrive?
@radiophan yeah it sounds pretty good
@Gambit_ka yeah saying all of this though, if dan and phil wrote a book i would not complain lol
@Gambit_ka about it since she started youtube, its always been one of her ambitions.
@Gambit_ka yh, im not agree just find it a bit ridiculous. Like you aren't writers. I don't count carrie fletcher though as she's spoken
@lovethelester yeah the thing is although it's stupid they're writing books i still want to read them. Connor's sounds really cool!
@hirolester @radiophan no, connor franta. x
@radiophan yup connor franta:) x
@kickthepj i don't think people understand DO NOT
@Gambit_ka thing is though, i still wanna read some of them, i really wanna read Connor's, it sounds interesting and I also want Grace's.
@ConnorFranta when does it come out in uk? #connorfrantabook
@musicalbethan scallop?
@PhilipsLlama doesn't everyone. i think you have to be a mad man not to
"Thanks for that" - sounds annoyed  
"Thanks a bunch" - sounds furious
#connorfrantabook omg i can't wait! When does it come out in uk? :) x @connorfranta
#thevampsvip i couldn't get tix and would love to meet you, you're such inspirations to me!
#thevampsvip would really love to meet you guys!
