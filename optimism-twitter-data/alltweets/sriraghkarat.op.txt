@Satriale80 @Phil_LFCDT Auba, Bacca, Higuain, Martinez, Paco Alacer for starters
@RaksMistry The current path leads to that unless something changes.
@RaksMistry what's worse is that fans are content with it
@RaksMistry I worry for our club tbh, we are on our way to become next Leeds. Club lacks vision,strategy and leadership.
@GraemeKelly1 @grubbavitch But what's the level we are trying to improve to? Will Ings make a significant difference? Genuinely doubt it
@GraemeKelly1 @grubbavitch So we replace shit with lesser shit but the fact is they are still shit.
@emptyMINDZ problems is what's their definition of top strikers. Is it Ings and Benteke? Most likely it is
@SamuelAdams89 will cost a lot of money Bilbao doesn't sell cheap
@Appatakker worst part is I actually believe that we are capable of such idiocy
@Appatakker Palmeri is probably trolling himself. Proper wind up merchant
@AnfieldEurope or vice versa
@paul_tomkins just pointing that out.
@paul_tomkins Not having a go at you but simply saying managing is about doing better than the individual sum.
@paul_tomkins @jacklusby_ or how Wolfsburg didn't go up from midtable to second best team in Bundesliga or how Soton should be in relegation
@paul_tomkins @jacklusby_ Also on how Klopp spent a lot and failed in Dortmund or how Roma has been a failure under Rudi Garcia or
@paul_tomkins @jacklusby_ Can we have a stat piece on how Simeone couldn't beat the wage bill and transfer money in La Liga also please.
@19YNWA Honestly not arsed about losing Depay it was obvious but I am angry at the club leaks, why leak news and get embarrassed?
@Kman316 @Anfield_Talk Don't get what the Arabs get out of it, why buy it for a more expensive deal? When they can buy cheaper now?
@Kman316 @Anfield_Talk Seems like a good plan for them tbh. Use club money, make it stable, cut down wage bill and sell to highest bidder
@paul_grech Probably agent using our name to attract interest
Deja Vu 
@GraemeBailey @19YNWA Deja Vu
@Kman316 @Anfield_Talk Well I certainly hope it happens before 4/5 years. Within 4/5 years we will be well behind the top 4
@paul_tomkins @AnfieldIndex @JimFish286 we lack that emotion and it's displayed perfectly in this article.
@paul_tomkins @AnfieldIndex @JimFish286 Don't get the term emotion, is ambition an emotion? Yes it is. The one which drives to do better...
@paul_tomkins @andyj4mes won't put it on paper without confirmed sources. Common sense.
@paul_tomkins @andyj4mes If Barrett,Pearce, Hunter,Bascombe and King says something then it's coming from the club. Else reliable reporters
@Kman316 @Anfield_Talk Umm if they manage to sell us that is
@emptyMINDZ Lol. He is probably another Assaidi
But he liked Welcome to Liverpool comment...... Hahahaha #LFC  
@SamMcGuire90 Especially when our top striker is Sterling with 8 goals
@sachins4u @Priya_Menon Toddy at its best <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ianuragthakur @OfficeOfRG Haha do you think the tweets will reach him without mummy's approval ?
@DailyMail @AgentSaffron I know this isn't British news but a general comment
@DailyMail @AgentSaffron it's a reaction to the advent of such mullahs in Britain
@DailyMail @AgentSaffron Not even surprised that ultra anti immigrant right wingers like Katie Hopkins and UKIP has come up in Britain...
@grubbavitch @TalkingAnfield And this team is well set up for counters but for some reason we try to imitate tiki taka and fail miserably
@grubbavitch @TalkingAnfield Everton and Arsenal matches were one of the highlights of our counters
@mario_aquilina Any idea how good Ntep is?
@AnfieldHQ96 @Anfield_Talk He would play through a ACL
@Appatakker @TheEngancheRole @GFN_France Never seen him, good player?

@LurkingonAl @AnfieldHQ96 Depay on hold for Benteke, typical us. Just impossibly small minded.
@Luttxav @ViktorFagerLFC Who is talking about oil money? I am just saying we are simply not ambitious enough, fans and the club
@Luttxav @ViktorFagerLFC Lol. Nope realistic and not blind to believe it's all rosy and positive what's happening at the club
@ViktorFagerLFC Need investment or a brilliant manager mate. I can't see either happening this summer, FSG looks oddly content
@ViktorFagerLFC deserve only 5th and so on when other clubs massively improve.
@ViktorFagerLFC I don't think there is anything optimistic about our current plight tbh. We can make ourselves happy by saying we....
@ViktorFagerLFC When they sign Pogba we will still be praising Joe Allen for his passing. Disappointing.
@LFCZA I don't think anyone other than him has a strong opinion about Allen
Exact emotions <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 
@Soccerstarzltd @paul_grech if he was good enough for Porto I think they would have already signed him. Porto signs them up very young
@Sherlin_LFC Yet we are all fuckwits be should be satisfied with a 5th placed finish right? ;)
@awryaditi Horrible
Graduate studies = hell <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@CarinaAnders @Corballyred @DanKennett @pablito69 to what Rafa did with us. Rodgers lacks that strategy, in market and pitch.
@CarinaAnders @Corballyred @DanKennett @pablito69 losses and some gems like Turan Costa Koke etc made the counters brilliant, very similar
@CarinaAnders @Corballyred @DanKennett @pablito69 of Barca or Madrid but he can coach them to concede least goals and reducing goals reduced
@CarinaAnders @Corballyred @DanKennett @pablito69 It's very simple, he innovated to win. He realized that he can never match the talent...
@emptyMINDZ If so many free transfers are on pipeline I don't see him leaving tbh
@emptyMINDZ Interest in Benteke shows anything but that
@monkey_sponge Yes I agree, but there are currently many better options than Liverpool for him I believe
@emptyMINDZ Honestly I prefer smart free transfers than spending 30 mn on hyped players like Benteke
@monkey_sponge If City goes for him then I don't see him coming to us, good chance Chelsea will offer Remy plus 15 mn
@RyanMcTrippy Great character in the side

Mkhitaryan flashback
Willian flashback
Sanchez flashback
…
@emptyMINDZ It's funny that we think he will wait for us. What kind of deluded idiots run the club?
@ibnlive Does Robert Vadra ignore?
@SamMcGuire90 @jacklusby_ @RyanMcTrippy Odds Lovren will be the VC? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@emptyMINDZ Yeah when you put it that way, then we should give it a shot
@monkey_sponge Anything on Depay mate? If Depay and PSV are happy with offers what's stopping the deal? Any idea?
@emptyMINDZ If we buy him I'd loan him to a lesser club before play him in first team tbh
@emptyMINDZ Not too sure. He had an excellent World Cup but has been really poor for Porto this season.
@wallflower_ish @IndiaSpeaksPR #mychoice
@monkey_sponge genuine interest in him?
@emptyMINDZ Massively hyped
@Nazdagama @AzzurriLFC I do hope we go for him instead of Depay. Will cost lesser and is more of what we need.
@Nazdagama @AzzurriLFC a bit criminal that top clubs haven't bought him yet. Top player
@emptyMINDZ We will probably go for Joel Ward
@GraemeKelly1 @alanthomas1969 Arsene Wenger gets Arsenal to top 4 every year without such a striker
@Nazdagama Ideal for us imo. Mobile and hardworking CF
@MagicOfCoutinho If City bids 40 mn for him I'd sell him without a blink
@hunter_troll Ali? Tyson?
Boring but effective as hell

@LFCTransferNRS Not a boxing fan, still shelling out 100 Usd
@Dean_C_Chapman Sent Ser Mers Tyrant to beat them up
@KOPWATCH lol
@IndigoLFC potentially Depay is the next Ronaldo but it can go either ways. Still think he is off to United though as we will screw it up
@IndigoLFC Marko plays RW, Depay is better centrally. He is good at Sterling's position
@Hari_Sethi @Satriale80 @TonyBarretTimes I don't get the point putting Depay on hold until we sign a striker, both mutually exclusive?
RIP Rebecca Ferdinand. Thoughts with you @rioferdy5

@thisisanfield Klopp never spent 212 mn and made the squad worse than it was or treated his captain badly.
@DHardayal Still don't think he is all that effective but maybe he needs a better coach to develop him
@DHardayal He was deemed the next big thing after Neymar in Brazilian football, hasn't lived up to that.
@DHardayal Moura hasn't done anything significant at PSG over last few years
@Nikz_LFC Wait for it. End of season he is mostly gone

@grubbavitch @LFC_Australia Not the Dortmund team of last three years of course, I was talking about the present one.
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch A DoF lid necessary but again there will be issues if Brendan plays politics. So not too sure.
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch manager wants them
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch I am quite sure our scouts have looked at talents in Spain, Portugal,Germany etc but I am not too sure if the...
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch more than results. We need some changes in the management level in summer
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch He looked the man for the job a year back but he has looked totally lost this season and is interested in PR..
@grubbavitch @LFC_Australia Yes but I think the core of the team can play the Dortmund model better than Dortmund if trained well
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch Not the only solution but I don't think Brendan is the solution either
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch Swansea manager can take it then Klopp definitely can
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch Again our expectations are not to win the title every season currently, it is to get top 4 so if a former...
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch than Brendan
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch I think it is less dependent on the league and more on the quality of the manager. Klopp has more quality..
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch I doubt that mate. Dortmund's expectations were small few years back, now they expect regular CL and cups
@grubbavitch @LFC_Australia Who is linking us to Illarmendi? Can't see any links in media
@grubbavitch @LFC_Australia players like Benteke which I think won't change as long as Brendan is around
@grubbavitch @LFC_Australia Not too sure imo. My main issue are with the players we are after, we are again after mediocre overpriced...
@LFC_Australia @grubbavitch Hodgson &amp; Brendan were 'PL proven' one was terrible and other is doing ok. Whole idea of PL proven is stupid imp
@LfcDan Exactly. He is waiting if Arsenal is interested. Nothing more
@TheEngancheRole the squad players are the starters.
@mario_aquilina Wouldn't mind if we get Depay,sell Sterling and buy another forward but we will probably go for someone like Albrighton
@ElstonGunn_ @ViktorFagerLFC Similar to #WelcomeWillain #WelcomeMkhitaryan #WelcomeCosta <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Musker_LFC Lacazette is probably most similar to Studge. Or Vietto
@AnfieldHQ96 Yes like Willian, Mkhitaryan,Costa etc
@MercyRuled Everything alright here in LA. Only in Baltimore mate.
@Moskvaa Haha fair enough!
@Moskvaa Ok except Steven Gerrard all Brits are boring :P
@Moskvaa All Brits are
@victormoren @LFC_360 I agree but we can get players who are close to world class like Depay but we will go for over rated ones like Benteke
@LFC_360 @victormoren every summer we get more disappointing. Haven't had a good summer window since Benitez days
@M_Sweeting Especially when we have a specialist young RB at bench. It's way too bizarre
@The_IstanBull @jagdesh Funny thing is we will pay 40mn
@br_uk @GuillemBalague One season hugely distorts those stats
@awryaditi after all, all men are potential rapists aren't they
@awryaditi So according to that logic, all marriages are rape as either your parents find you a rapist or you find yourself one. Sound.
@TalkingAnfield Jovetic has an injury record as bad as Sturridge
@StambergJ Yes we've hardly seen Henry or Werner at Merseyside this season and their lack of involvement is reflected
@StambergJ of buying the right players for the right positions
@StambergJ Problem is that the managers sometimes buy for themselves and not the club, they buy players in their comfort zone instead..
@StambergJ No definitely not. Need to target ones like Lacazette, Vietto etc.
@StambergJ which can be done within the model I believe, just needs right scouting and a manager with good reputation
@StambergJ I agree. The squad is young and good but we need to take development to next level by signing some established players...
@StambergJ Emery has shown that you can manage league position and do well in Europa. Most under rated coach in Europe imo
@StambergJ our reputation in Europe as well as improving our coefficient. I don't get why some say it's better not to qualify for it..
@StambergJ Yes exactly. Especially with the Europa winner playing in CL, I think it's an important competition, it also helps in...
..gibberish anyway so it really doesn't matter much.
Not even Sterling. We need to invest in South American and continental talents which is the roadmap to good transfers. Home grown rules are
..talent which has reduced our quality. Not a single British player at Liverpool would get into starting 11 of the top 4 teams.
All points to the fact that British players are less talented than Germans,French,Spanish,Belgians etc but LFC invests a lot into English...
United has a fair amount of academy players who are British and Arsenal are investing less on British players despite buying Chambers
Not a single British manager other than Brendan in top 6, coincidence? How many English players in Chelsea or City?
Other than Klopp my preferred managers to replace BR would be Emery or Boer, continental football is on the rise &amp; we must take advantage
The current model or structure is not an efficient one so I hope to see the rest button pressed in the summer with a new structure &amp; manager
Also I don't see how transfer committee is absolved of blame by some fans. Both BR as well as committee have made mistakes.
improve the team &amp; if Klopp is available then they will definitely go for him.If BR gets 10 points of next 4 matches I see him staying(2/2)
Last 3 matches have been nothing but deplorable tactics and I don't buy the news that his position isn't safe,FSG are always looking to(1/2)
Would love Klopp at LFC but again for the sake of stability I wouldn't mind Brendan with a DoF but Brendan needs to get his shit right
@grubbavitch @ElstonGunn_ @rkb89 @GrkStav @carlimalabar @pelle2x Thanks for the mention Nathan :)
@grubbavitch yes definitely and most importantly he will improve us defensively. He is a younger version of Rafa imo
@grubbavitch Klopp or Emery for me else BR under a DoF, can't give transfer powers to BR which will make the situation worse
Can't see us getting more than 6 points out of the next 12, if that happens then I think Rodgers is gone.
@grubbavitch Yes which is why I think we need a manager like Klopp to attract continental players instead of a British manager
@grubbavitch Yes but if we lose way then we must start again, it's the current problem
@Satriale80 @Andrew_Heaton Comolli was sacked before Kenny, I see the same pattern here
@emptyMINDZ Comolli was sacked few weeks before Kenny so I think there is a pattern here.
@secondofhername All hail Sharia
@Sherlin_LFC more commercial than an unfair deal imo
@Sherlin_LFC Not really actually. Bayern is a well run club, I'd be pissed off with something like City-Etihad deal but Bayern deal is ok...

@mephobia8 do you think FSG wants a change?
@JamesPearceEcho @DanKennett Yes but they don't decide the tactics not they decide to play Glen Johnson and Balotelli
@LFC @JHenderson Rhetorical
@dezert_fox @LFC Not really, with a good summer and a good manager we can definitely get CL.
@KamaaalKhanKRK @BDUTT You're neither we all know

@stehoare @Satriale80 a manager's actual work is brought out when a collective set of players play well which hasn't happened this season
@stehoare @Satriale80 The plan was non existent even when Sturridge was playing, it's very nice to have 3rd best player in the world but...
@Musker_LFC @BillyCampbell_1 proven managers than inexperienced managers then go on the cycle of sacking them and hiring again?
@Musker_LFC @BillyCampbell_1 I don't get the obsession with inexperience tbh. How much do managers wages cost tbh? Better to invest in
@ViktorFagerLFC Rodgers lost the dressing room. Only explanation I can think for that performance
@LfcDan they definitely won't sack him now but he is gone at end of the season
@BillyCampbell_1 @Carra23 its sarcasm mate
@HenryJackson87 thank you

From today’s Telegraph… 
@Kita___K for boycotting this shit
@Kita___K the fans
@Kita___K End of season. No point sacking right now
@JamesPearceEcho Transfer committee are shit in tactics aren't they?
@Nikz_LFC Yup. Everyone except manager seems to think so
@Nikz_LFC Absolute shit game
@SamMcGuire90 @AnfieldHQ96 Still deserves a shot in his natural position
@Kita___K Hahaha
@TonyEvansTimes Is the system or algorithm being followed? Buying shit players for huge money is not the algorithm as fast as I know
@sisteers Can't wait for change of staff in management
@MattyMcGreal @LfcDan @stehoare @_Lukall_ Probably but I think it's easier said than done which is why a tactically excellent manager is imp
@MattyMcGreal @LfcDan @stehoare @_Lukall_ I have a problem with the team picked. Put Lambert instead of Balo I can assure you same result
@MattyMcGreal @LfcDan @stehoare @_Lukall_ Lol. Sure. You play the team to the strengths and not to their weakness
@LfcDan @stehoare @MattyMcGreal @_Lukall_ He has always been ineffective when played as a lone striker yet BR repeats the same

@simonbrundish @TalkingAnfield to it. Making a subjective issue objective doesn't really help
@simonbrundish @TalkingAnfield ratings are bullshit in every system. Only stats can be considered useful, ratings have no proven method...
@TalkingAnfield @simonbrundish Opta is the only site that's scientifically accurate imo
@AgentSaffron Giving the media and left wing the ammo they desperately need
@AgentSaffron Idiocy at best
@stehoare Haha fair enough mate. Not worth getting mad over, better things in life
@stehoare For a person who doesn't care about football you tweet an awful lot about football <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
Waiting for @sardesairajdeep and @sagarikaghose to say that's an insignificant amount and is an election tactic 
@Kman316 Exactly what I ve been saying. If he had assurances about his future he wouldn't be giving such interviews
@Kman316 @ViktorFagerLFC Always does it and gets ridiculed. He needs media training
@karlmatchett @br_uk City is the new Liverpool
@JackSear @LfcDan Considering how bad we are at identifying talent that is
@JackSear Benteke has an injury record comparable to Sturridge,he will cost north of 30 mn. Lacazette and Higuain are way way better
@ViktorFagerLFC Quite embarrassing. So delusional that it's quite funny now
@aybrtr @SamMcGuire90 Haha good one
@SamMcGuire90 I wish Rodgers was on Twitter to read this
@emptyMINDZ ego
Interested in learning a scripting language in the summer. Any suggestions and where I can learn?
@MarvinScheffold I'm an electrical engineer, working in computer networks field.

@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox fair enough
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox no it was what I saw here on Twitter as is your info
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox in politics
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox No model will work if BR can pipe down his ego and work with them but unfortunately he is more interested...
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox either we need a faster and more skillful striker
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox Yes he did but still could have had same issues with us. Bony is a limited player, doesn't suit our system...
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox discussing it but it's a stupid model altogether as it lacks accountability
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox And what you're saying is correct? None of us know what exactly happens in committee so pointless...
@BillyCampbell_1 @dezert_fox Committee wanted Lacazette and Rodgers didn't
@dezert_fox @BillyCampbell_1 Not like Bony is tearing the league apart in City right?
@sardesairajdeep @narendramodi @PMOIndia yeah he is doing his job, no need to thank him but he has been the only one doing it since 20 years
Praising the PM and expressing sympathy for Nepal victims are mutually things 
@Nur_11_1 @MirrorFootball It's about Sol's comments on he didn't become English captain because he was black
@TheCoutinhoRole Another draw or loss. It's getting tiresome
@MirrorFootball thank god Sol didn't accuse Liverpool of racism because they don't meet Sterling's wage demands
@dezert_fox Says who? Nothing is confirmed. Rodgers looks desperate in press conferences which means he has received no assurances
@dezert_fox I think he is gone after the season. Don't see any evidence of him being here
@clockworkclown @thevirdas @awryaditi Just to conclude, it's blatantly disrespectful towards what people suffer in North Korea.
@dezert_fox @alanthomas1969 @Coltman_S And be practical, most of them live in a dreamland where Rodgers is the saviour
@dezert_fox @alanthomas1969 @Coltman_S excuses for a manger who will say dramatic crap. Do not bother. Our fan base needs to improve

@pelle2x Another crock
@stehoare @Footy_MarcoL @Satriale80 that idea is the problem, player must be bought for the club not a manager. Manager plays with best 11
Worst week ever. Sometimes you lose interest in life altogether
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge Both clubs have been more successful than us in recent years imo
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge Yes Valencia has been spending lately but under Emery they finished 3rd in 3 consecutive seasons
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge Sevilla still won Europa without any money mate and might win it again despite losing Rakitic
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge really well if we somehow hold on to CL and appoint a world class manager
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge with that model. Yes their success is limited but with our spending power in two seasons we can do...
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 @monkey_sponge Don't agree tbh. Plenty of bargains are available. Roma,Sevilla,Valencia are all successful...
@KOPWATCH instead of moaning about transfers he needs to get his tactics right, shambles at the moment
@JimBoardman talking out of his ass here. If I was him if shut up and win matches
@Moley_LFCDT another question, is Klopp an upgrade over Rodgers? And won't he work with a DoF which Rodgers won't do?
@Moley_LFCDT are we capable of competing for CL? All nos, don't think he achieved any targets then
@Moley_LFCDT Are we moving forward? Did we get into CL this year? Is the squad good enough for CL next year? After 212 investment...
@TheEngancheRole manager doesn't have an eye for talent which is a terrible combination
@TheEngancheRole and Balotelli would have never been bought. The essential problem is owners don't know enough about football and the ...
@TheEngancheRole problem is there is no one to tie up the manager and the owners, if there was a DoF players like Lovren, Lallana, Lambert..
@Anfield_Talk @JamesPearceEcho James is a sad excuse for a journalist. Hopefully Echo will sack him before we sack Rodgers
@LFCZA *End
@LFCZA No civil war mate. Everyone is too disappointed with the kind of drab coming from the manager and team. Mend of story
@Kita___K Probably only way to get rid of him without paying 10mn
@Kita___K Nah I hope they do!
@Kita___K Haha that's a bit too much :P
@sisteers @JamesPearceEcho Terrible article nevertheless! He thinks fans are idiots
@LivEchoLFC How do you even sell this load of crap? Seriously. Shit paper
@Jay_78_ @HenryJackson87 Looked like a man whose lost the dressing room today
@DavidFisher8 @JasonRoberts21 Emery,Klopp or De Boer are certain upgrades, they know how to win. Rodgers doesn't at least as of now
@DavidFisher8 @JasonRoberts21 he won Europa league and has consistently made it to CL with teams like Valencia and Sevilla on zero budget
@simonbrundish Haha about right. I burnt some bridges today after being called plastic by some twats
@simonbrundish How long before an idiot calls you a plastic?
@JasonRoberts21 Congrats man! That's one great kid :)
@Satriale80 Horrendous tactics. The side wasn't even balanced. Not a single left footed player in the team today.
Play players based on how many games left for player to reach playing record.

@JasonRoberts21 Was started in RAWK by Kristian Bennett, I am skeptical
Prayers with people of Nepal :(
@simonbrundish He has learnt imo but the problem is he learns, corrects mistakes, gets hyped and reverts to mistakes
@lipibatra <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JasonRoberts21 Monchi coming to Liverpool is not a rumor right? No media reporting it I guess
Hahaha story of the day 
@lipibatra Out of context that's hilarious
@mario_aquilina If we get him which I don't think we will
@rameshsrivats Rajni any day<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@TalkingAnfield Definitely PSV using us to get more money from United. Who would've thought!
@Priya_Menon @sagarcasm You're missing a lot in your life

Me: 

Now i'm off to cry in a corner
@hitman8976rawk @TheEngancheRole Falcao in summer right?
@hitman8976rawk @TheEngancheRole problem with that is, we didn't want Balotelli last April and we signed him because we missed Sanchez &amp;
@TheEngancheRole most under appreciated footballer of all times
@RiseOfTheKop still don't think we ll complete the deal
@ViktorFagerLFC Biggest problem in his career has been winning MOTY. Ultra boost to his ego
@hunter_troll reeks of desperation
@secondofhername @ashutosh83B I don't know if it should be deemed hilarious or simply embarrassing new low of politics in this country
@secondofhername @ashutosh83B hahaha
@JasonRoberts21 Also got some great advice on why I shouldn't support LFC at all. Lol. The statement was supported by a certain TIA author
@JasonRoberts21 I was called a plastic and a wool yesterday because I said continental football is better than British football
@LFCZA @RadioCityNews not one person. Brendan for PM
@falconed_ @PMOIndia @narendramodi this tweet oozes stupidity at so many levels
@Elninocharlatan @_Gags_ You're right. Pulis knows how to dismantle us
@PMOIndia no self praise please, let's leave that to AAP
Remember this time last year entire British media were praising and boot licking Rodgers and Martinez? Top times
@Sherlin_LFC We need to get you into the transfer committee ;)
@LFCFansCorner If you think Rodgers can win Europa then you're taking piss mate
@theraywilson Agreed. No point sacking him if no other manager is available but we should actively look for an upgrade
@AnfieldEurope @AnfieldHQ96 not many other things
@AnfieldEurope @AnfieldHQ96 done decently in terms of tactics. Only thing he has been very successful in is developing youngsters
@AnfieldEurope @AnfieldHQ96 Never was a tactical genius, if someone called him that then they don't know much about football
@Saki_LFC Haha need to do that
@Saki_LFC Sick and tired of his bullshit mate. He talks so much out of his ass that he is embarrassing the club
@Saki_LFC after seeing today's press conference I think BR is a bit insecure about his job. Was defensive about his achievements
@jon9clark @Andrew_Heaton 12th placed manager in PL who managed Swansea in PL for a year managed us for last 3 years, so I think 9th is ok
@RioGring0 @_Gags_ Chelsea ,PSG and City always had top managers
@DanKennett @emptyMINDZ it wasn't great. Read this. 
@S4ffy1 @Saki_LFC Yes Ashley Williams
@Saki_LFC James Rodrigues Ronaldo and Bale in that position. Unless they sell Bale, don't see a reason to buy Hazard
@Saki_LFC Madrid? Odd transfer for them if true.
@PeteKopite or a good group of people to make the right transfers
@wilsoncov @Saki_LFC we are free agent wankers <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Saki_LFC In Epl?
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 think it will be a success
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 this summer is probably the last chance to set things right but I ve lost all faith in the management staff to
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 will be competing with Spurs for 5th place as we are now
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 and Lambert this is what you get. With the same trend the gap between us and top 4 will simply increase and we
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Not in denial at all. If we had spent better we would be in top 4 but when you spend 50 mn in Lovren, Lallana...
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 was a success. Unnecessary explanation and digging his own hole here
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 not taking out of context but he wasn't asked about wage bill or anything. All that was asked is whether it...
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Rather be honest than live in denial
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Need to deflect question or say this season hasn't been a success and we want to do better. Simple.
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 A month before this he said this team can win CL and two months later 5th place became ok all of a sudden?
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 us that again. Rodgers is a good manager but he doesn't have that X factor or experience
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 agreed which is why we need an X factor, last year Suarez gave us that. I think someone like Klopp can give...
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 moreover he should be defending his job by winning next 5 matches not in press conferences
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Nope it shows small time mentality. Even if he thinks 5th is realistic saying it in a press conference is naive..
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 we have much bigger resources mate. Our revenue is way higher both clubs I believe, thanks to TV deal
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Fans aren't club isn't but manager does look happy. "We are on par with expectations "
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 at least there should be a better recruitment team in place but doing nothing will regress the team
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 whether in the form of manager or players. Getting a better manager is not pressing reset button imo
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 yes agreed. I am trying to say that being happy with our position doesn't help we need upgrades this summer...
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 with half of our wage bill
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 With better recruitment and tactics we can consistently outperform like Dortmund did before this season that too
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Problem is we are happy with it.We should be focused on out performing it and winning cups too. Doing neither atm
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 is a failure imo
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 place on points. We are closer to top 4 on wage bill and need to outperform that. If we don't then the season
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 quite realistic. If we take wage bill comparison we should be competing with the top 4 than be closer to 6th....
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 us and Chelsea yet we are equal on points
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Spurs is a very bad standard to compare with imo. The gap between their wage bill and ours is almost as much as
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 The problem is Spurs has always been a upper mid table club, not us. Our aspirations are totally different
@LfcDan Nevertheless he feels the need to sell himself instead of getting required results, bad precedent
@sagarikaghose Is there a point spreading unnecessary venom when the government has done nothing close to that?
@LFCFansCorner Isn't one Sturridge enough?
@JasonRoberts21 Moreover the minute we are content with 5th place we become a mid table club
@JasonRoberts21 No delusions involved. We could have spent it better but we didn't and we are suffering consequences.
@pjjcroker @JasonRoberts21 Spurs spent as much as us this season? What ? <NEUTRAL FACE>
@paul_tomkins @DanKennett *if
@paul_tomkins @DanKennett How does that work? Mid it doesn't work then he reverts to I had no say that's why it failed? Paradoxical
@RobbieSavage8 @MirrorFootball looking forward to it. On managerial situation?
@LfcDan He was being defensive and is living in denial. Root of the problem
@elninakauser @jasganger10 Haha good one. Despite winning Bundesliga and reaching CL final he is humble as a pie
@Satriale80 @royhendo Can only judge from what we have seen. Exactly why I said they are potential success
@Satriale80 @royhendo how? I ve said in general since arrival.  This season restricted to summer arrivals
@Satriale80 @royhendo or to the team in general since arrival
@Satriale80 @royhendo Significant contribution to the season
We should be all over this <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 
@Satriale80 @royhendo Don't think Moreno and Markovic have contributed consistently and been a major cog in our season
@Satriale80 @royhendo I like Sakho but he has a lot of aspects he needs to improve on but playing with Skrtel and Lovren doesn't help
@Satriale80 @royhendo Other than Sturridge Can and Coutinho I don't think rest are absolute success, potential success probably
Also I am not qualified to support @LFC because of that. Such idiots on Twitter, it kills me that human intelligence has stopped so low
So I am apparently a 'wool' because I think continental football is doing better than British football.
@royhendo @NoLocalsBlog seriously? We have won one match out of 7 against top 4 teams, have +2 G.D and have 0 trophies.As good as any?
@royhendo 2 signings out of almost 25 signings is not a good percentage of success imo
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 facts are facts. Look at UCL semis or quarters and tell me the number of British teams in it.
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 so you're judging my loyalty on the fact I said continental football is better than British? Sound
@NoLocalsBlog got Lovren last season
@NoLocalsBlog again we have wanted a DM for 3 season, we still have an injury prone Lucas. We needed a boss CB for 3 seasons and we have...
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 If you have nothing to argue with then call the other person plastic and run. Signs of an idiot
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 Proper sheeps like you are the problem with this club. Open your eyes and think with your head for once
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 would a player play under Wenger, Klopp, Simeone or Rodgers. Answer is obvious
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 of a great in making. Continental football is on rise and we must take advantage of that
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 problem is British football is not so good and so being the best British manager is good but no indication...
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 many. Sanchez,Mkhitaryan, Costa to name a few
@NoLocalsBlog @royhendo it was Suarez and lot of good set pieces. This season we don't have it
@NoLocalsBlog @royhendo I think these tweaks are not that easy. We need a new approach or something of an X factor to compete, last season..
@NoLocalsBlog @royhendo so we have a better squad or a similar squad to that of City or United? Disagree mate.
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 manager, bring a new manager and go for continental talent instead of domestic. Will do world of good
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 No the idea is to change the whole structure. Players don't come partially due to lack of reputation of the...
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 Problem is we have very less time to catch up before it's too late and people don't realize it
@FMPressure @HenryJackson87 And how long are we going to be a job in progress? And how long before youngsters like Sterling want to leave?
@royhendo @NoLocalsBlog we haven't bought well for last 5 transfer windows, what makes you think we will now?
@sagarikaghose @timesofindia I know the guy who owns the ad company, total douche. Glad it's pulled down!
@HenryJackson87 do read that about his tactical issues. Very well written
@HenryJackson87 
@HenryJackson87 LFC requires him to work with world class players which he is not able to do
@HenryJackson87 very bad idea imo. He lacks the tactics and reputation for a club like ours, he is good with youngsters but a team like...
@LFCFansCorner nope
@Nina_LFC @FinklerQuestion @AzzurriLFC their cautiousness will be their downfall. Need to cease the opportunity
@Untamed__Heart latter

@wallflower_ish Stunt organized by AAP?

give their 100% but I rather have 25% of players like Kompany, Busquets and Ramos than 100% of Lovren, Allen and Toure. Quality &gt; Commitment

@LukePowell_96 @Tiramisouness Agreed
@ViktorFagerLFC Belfast Telegraph is full of shit. Move on to next.
@Fydsy @Saki_LFC @RaksMistry @AlvinMack2 chooses a new manager. We need DoF and manager to have a working relationship which is very imp
@Fydsy @Saki_LFC @RaksMistry @AlvinMack2 Yes I agree. But I hope if we are changing the manager then a DoF is appointed first and he ....
@Fydsy @Saki_LFC @RaksMistry @AlvinMack2 Yes but I think they will persuade him to bring a DoF instead of sacking at first
@Sherlin_LFC Haha yes, it was long back. Haven't been able to write much in last few months
@Fydsy @Saki_LFC @RaksMistry @AlvinMack2 unlikely they will sack him right now. 6 games to go and who will take over for those 6 games?
@Sherlin_LFC I never wrote an article mate. I think you mentioned the wrong person <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@mrVance85 @AnfieldHQ96 @BRANNAN88 right now he is in the latter category. Needs 6 solid good games to keep his job
@mrVance85 @AnfieldHQ96 @BRANNAN88 Honestly switching formation is one thing but not being able to figure out a formation is another....
@Sherlin_LFC Take note @John_W_Henry
@mrVance85 @AnfieldHQ96 @BRANNAN88 Not too sure if BR knows tbh. He still has to figure the best formation
@Sherlin_LFC they all have lower wage bills compared to the position on the table but I think its dependent on manager and the buys
@Sherlin_LFC Tbh you don't need a huge wage bill to compete. Look at Athletico, Porto, Juventus, Arsenal,Valencia,Sevilla etc
@Sherlin_LFC Question is who advises them? And if they haven't got the idea by repeated mistakes when will they learn?
@BRANNAN88 @AnfieldHQ96 Immobile yes but he is no where near world class. A very mediocre striker
@BRANNAN88 @AnfieldHQ96 with Pogba leaving they will want another midfielder and Chelsea loves hoarding
@BRANNAN88 @AnfieldHQ96 Very unlikely mate. He will have better suiters, probably off to Juventus or even Chelsea
His team is a bitch to beat. That's why they're good. But defence …
@Sherlin_LFC We are going to try to get good players but I don't see a reason why anyone would want to play for BR tbh
Suarez vs Evra &amp; Chiellini
@AnfieldHQ96 @BRANNAN88 to play for BR and us I have no idea.Pjanic is going to a CL club or stay at Roma,our striker will probably be Ings
@AnfieldHQ96 @BRANNAN88 You guys have a good account but this article oozes naivety. Why would Pjanic and a world class striker want...
@grubbavitch I hate these British pundits love for Brendan tbh.He has been crap this season &amp; they blame FSG or committee for his failings
@stehoare I'm glad that if Real wins then Ancelotti stays. Deserves another year
@Sherlin_LFC Rodgers should take note. Simeone spent a fraction of what Rodgers did
@secondofhername We score enough ok <UNAMUSED FACE> if you're talking about goals that is
@Phil_LFCDT Rofl
@Phil_LFCDT Why wouldn't they get Depay?
@Satriale80 Even if they invest another 150 man and Rodgers bust it on mediocre crap, certain people will blame FSG
@jacklusby_ prefer a mobile forward like Aubeyang tbh
@jacklusby_ my point precisely. 4 of them together have scored only around 25 goals this season. We need a 20 goal striker who will be fit
@Kman316 @JackSear Bad idea mate. He is quite average
@JackSear no
@LFCZA @pjoyceexpress aka Ings
@PeteKopite @Nazdagama Milner has done well at set pieces I believe
@jacklusby_ @guardian_sport @DaveHytner Not like he has been all that great. Been average all season
Congress handle? Wins Twitter? ROFL 
@firstpost wins Twitter? Hahahaha
@PortuBall Not worth it. He is worth 20 mn tops
@awryaditi or beer
@Nazdagama @dezert_fox which is the main problem
@Nazdagama @dezert_fox Yup we didn't. Need to look at the future and ensure we won't make the same mistakes but we do mistakes on repeat...

@dezert_fox @Nazdagama we have a good core and it needs tinkering. WC players are tough but again we can get effective players like Cou...

@dezert_fox @Nazdagama agent squad, FFP and internal trouble. They are pressing reset button so we should too.
@TheLFCLA I will be there for the Hull match hopefully!
@dezert_fox @Nazdagama get a top class manager and make 2 world class signings then we have the top 4 spot
@dezert_fox @Nazdagama I think with a new coach and a good transfer budget, top 4 is for the taking. City looks vulnerable and if we....
@TheLFCLA Downtown. Near USC
@TheLFCLA fair enough mate
@TheLFCLA Yes but how many of us will be there? I am new to LA so I don't know the membership count <NEUTRAL FACE>
@sagarcasm You have a very good account man. Please don't endorse Pappu and spoil it <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@sagarcasm no you're not but you're endorsing his hypocrisy. Just clarifying things
@sagarcasm *charge bloody typo
@sagarcasm You do realize that UPA government was the one who accepted Airtel's request Richard Skype and other net services right?
@TheLFCLA possible to contact LA Galaxy and arrange a huge YNWA before match?
@TheLFCLA Do keep us updated! Would love to join!
@TheLFCLA guys are you arranging any welcome for Stevie G when he plays first match for LA Galaxy?
@TheLFCLA @JimBoardman @TheLFCOC @TheLFCSD Pretty good fan following
@BDUTT @bsindia Njce to see an unbiased view from you
@planetepics that's definitely photoshopped
@hunter_troll Rather not go for any Italians tbh
@AnfieldEurope They have spent 10 times more than us too to be fair
@Sherlin_LFC @OlisaOdacity @LFC_Mascot Monchi, Kenyon, Zorc and even someone like Capello
@Sherlin_LFC but it shouldn't be a case a signing is forced on one another
@Sherlin_LFC look at Monchi, Kenyon etc. done well at Valencia,Atletico. Important to ensure good working relationship between manager &amp; DoF
@Sherlin_LFC Commolli was a disaster because he simply bought what manager wanted, Baldini was a disaster because of AVB tactics...
@Sherlin_LFC for 70 mn
@Sherlin_LFC Problem is we will replace them with Ashley Williams,Sinclair, Britton and Ings
@LFCFansCorner will be happy for him. Deserves a good club
@Sherlin_LFC Nope. Because I am not sure whether he knows which is their right/favored positions
@MrBoywunder @Nazdagama Yup agreed. I am sure other owners in the consortium will be very unhappy with our season
@MrBoywunder @Nazdagama Are both of them mutually exclusive? I see Rodgers as part of the committee
@MrBoywunder @Nazdagama then why keep the current set up? I don't get it. When you have no faith in current set up then why keep it?
@MirrorFootball Lol. Typical.
@MrBoywunder Unbelievably small time thinking. If they sack Rodgers then they will definitely go for Gary Monk won't they?
@Nina_LFC @Nazdagama Huge occasion people. Delph eased through us as if he was Luka Modric.
@mojorojo Porto fans in India? What?
@pelle2x I don't think we have spent lesser than 40 mn in any transfer window till now
@tomkeeping @RedRegista problem is it's always nearly and always will be
2. Existing names are not New Delhi or Old Delhi
but.. htt…
@hunter_troll holders so there will be pressure on Henry and Morgan
@hunter_troll Thinking the same. It's very unlike FSG to do nothing after a pathetic season, doesn't instill confidence in rest of share...
@hunter_troll you think Rodgers is gone in summer mate?
@harikriss my point is that he is talented and shouldn't be written off so soon. Will be a better player in a 4-3-3
@harikriss not his fault we can't negotiate to save our lives
@harikriss League obviously matters, Portugese league doesn't have half the physicality of PL, he wasn't worth 20 mn but we are daft...
@SamuelAdams89 Ashley Willaims Sinclair Britton and Jay Rodriguez for 70 mn then
@TonyEvansTimes Hahaha joke
@hunter_troll @ThoseScouseLads @emptyMINDZ @TonyEvansTimes He hasn't lost players, they played decently against Newcastle
@harikriss him next season if he is given fair chance
@harikriss He has done way more? For a player who is 25 years and our marquee signing? Markovic comes from Portugese league let's judge...
@harikriss finishing and decision making but if Lallana is given a chance then Markovic definitely deserves one
@harikriss He is not a winger, more of an attacking AM but he has the pace and ball control. Excellent first touch too, needs to improve...
@harikriss Ok you're opinion perhaps but he has shown sparks of talent every time he has played. Playing him out of position hasn't helped
@harikriss Immaterial of what you think of Depay I really don't think Markovic can be called a flop. Rodgers has been very unfair on him
@mojorojo Honestly think Flash is a better show than Arrow. Daredevil was better than both.
@emptyMINDZ @SteveMcVeigh123 Hahaha I can imagine Klopp as JK Simmons in Whiplash!
@harikriss judging a player who has been played out of position all year and subbed off at 60th minute when he starts. Sound
@harikriss Markovic is an excellent talent who has been poorly managed and under utilized, what's the gurantee we won't do same with Depay?
@royhendo @Andrew_Heaton There needs to be a miracle if we are to sign Depay
@_CallumMWright Load of bs again. Koeman, Emery, Klopp etc worked/works under same strategy FSG strategy is nothing new in football
@ViktorFagerLFC *price
@ViktorFagerLFC A ploy to raise his prize when being sold to United, nothing more
@ViktorFagerLFC #Wetried definitely Depay has a gf who likes Manchester more?
@Andrew_Heaton @royhendo Hahaha good one. People who think we will get him are delusional
@DietmarHamann @TBlfc81 Your opinion on Rodgers?  I'm sure you won't openly say he needs to leave but I am still asking
@wallflower_ish @DrAMSinghvi @UberFacts Ask Soviet Russia and China on how socialism created great corruption within government
@wallflower_ish @DrAMSinghvi @UberFacts capitalism warrants less corruption than socialism which is anti elitist that's the problem
@sisteers Not the same mate. His season was marred by injuries to key players and lack of investment, we spent 212 mm in 3 years and failed
@sisteers FSG will be definitely be tempted by presence of Klopp right?
@MirrorFootball Alternate career options- Driving school
@sisteers your take on Rodgers mate?
@Kuvinho08 important than individual
@Kuvinho08 I honestly don't get what a real supporter, if all were real supporters by your definition Hodgson will be still here, club more
@SamuelAdams89 @Saki_LFC @Fydsy @dsclfc Don't see a reason why any of them should change their managers, all are having very good seasons
@Kuvinho08 I called you a sheep. Not him. @zodman100
@zodman100 Another sheep. Ignore @Kuvinho08
@tancredipalmeri anything on Klopp to LFC? Your opinion on it?
@SamuelAdams89 @Saki_LFC @Fydsy @dsclfc We are the best fit where he can flourish imo. Emotional connection coupled with enough money
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc too happily. Had massive issues with management
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc I know it would be crazy if it happens but they did try for Messi and Pep didn't leave Barca...
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc Just food for thought, any chance of Madrid going for Pep?
@stehoare Let's hope it's a start. Change in wage policy, better manager and a better recruitment policy = better future
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc Not saying you're wrong or right mate, just my opinion :)
@SamuelAdams89 @Fydsy @Saki_LFC @dsclfc good project? Not according to me. He would pounce at Liverpool job if offered imo but will we?
@SamuelAdams89 @Fydsy @Saki_LFC @dsclfc problem with that is Napoli is probably at a worse state than us,poor league and aging squad...
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc in the background. He wants the job badly
@Saki_LFC @Fydsy @SamuelAdams89 @dsclfc Klopp and Madrid are a bad fit imo. Quite unlikely it will happen especially with Zidane looming...
@Saki_LFC @SamMcGuire90 Not necessarily. Ancelotti might not even leave Madrid if he wins another CL which is not unlikely
@Satriale80 Yup most of it says he has his job for now. No guarantee about no change of mind
@SamuelAdams89 @_CallumMWright One reason why he would want to join the mess we have become please
@Kman316 spot on
@Anfieldlnsider @asterlsk_ definitely feel insecure about his job
@Anfieldlnsider @asterlsk_ But you may be right if Guardiola becomes available.  If all these top managers are available BR should
@Anfieldlnsider @asterlsk_ Highly unlikely mate. City definitely wants him
@MirrorFootball Hahaha
One thing I ve learnt from Twitter is that cynics are always right about Liverpool and the optimists are always wrong
@jagdesh It's their money and he wasted 212 mn. Take my word he will be gone by June but I hope Klopp is available till then
@SamMcGuire90 @jagdesh is too good an opportunity to let go and Henry will know that.
@SamMcGuire90 @jagdesh I can easily see Rodgers getting sacked, FSG won't say they will sack BR when we still have 6 games to go, Klopp...
@stehoare There is absolutely no width in the squad either
@stehoare Agreed but it's down to tactics too. Our midfield has no control or creativity despite having players like Coutinho
@ViktorFagerLFC why talk about only committee signings? Lovren Lallana and Lambert collectively cost 70 mn and they were experienced ones
@Satriale80 @stehoare yeah it's no so smart to say he will get sacked if we don't get top 4
@MarcoGiorgette @RiseOfTheKop Proper Brendan supporter *claps*
@RaksMistry PR mate. I'm sure we won't even go for him, all PR bs. Making a mockery of supporters
@ViktorFagerLFC lol
@BRabbetts @JimBoardman Lol. Meltdown
@Musker_LFC not Munain
@TheCoutinhoRole Rather 10 mm to sack him than incur more loss by keeping him
@TheCoutinhoRole @Musker_LFC are certainly top players who come with value and less wages. Problem is we target Ings and Williams
@TheCoutinhoRole @Musker_LFC top players , young and value doesn't have to be mutually exclusive . Players what Musker put up in prev tweet
FAV for Rodgers.
@LFCFansCorner yes
@RaksMistry Yup100% agreed. He has no one else to blame, we as fans have supported him as much as possible
@Anfieldlnsider @asterlsk_ going to Madrid either. Mostly Zidane is taking over Ancelotti there
@Anfieldlnsider @asterlsk_ But question is for the personality Klopp is would he want to go to a club like City? Doubt it. Can't see him...
@RaksMistry Funny how almost the entire fan base wants him out now. He hasn't done any favors for himself though
@liverbirdsd @TheCoutinhoRole Gerrard also said Joe Cole is like Messi,as good a player Gerrard is I dont think he is a good judge of talent
@GMC_1993 @LFCFansCorner So Ashley Williams, Britton, Sinclair and Bolaise
@MirrorFootball @davekiddmirror Yes Shankly took 13 years to win a trophy but that time we were in Championship and hadn't spent 212mn
@NumbYaar @Priya_Menon nakeded
@RedRegista Yup. Long term benefits. Wanted the same in Houllier's last season and when Hodgson was around. Long term of club more imp
@Jay_78_ @AnfieldHQ96 Such a stupid notion imo. Don't want to sack him as it might cost 10 mn but spend 30-40 mn on the transfers for him?

We are sitting here thinking about Ings, Milner …
@M_Sweeting Exactly what I ve been saying, keeping Rofgers when someone like Klopp is available is a bigger risk imo
@Himanshu_Lfc Pearce is a puppet. Talks rubbish
@M_Sweeting A very good core tbh. Add a class striker,  a DM, a CM &amp; a RB we are good to compete. Players like Allen and Lallana from bench
@LivEchoLFC @LFCZA there is your silver lining
@MeetAnimals red wedding
Rodgers 15 defeats..
Martinez 15 defeats..
@Fydsy @simonbrundish @DanKennett Lol well i wish I knew. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@simonbrundish @Fydsy @DanKennett He bottled her too ! Damn
@MirrorRowZed @MirrorFootball get her @LFC ! Better than most of our players
@simonbrundish Only one reason. A better manager isn't available
@Fydsy @DanKennett @simonbrundish Haha
@Fydsy @DanKennett @simonbrundish Nice girlfriend too
@DanKennett @simonbrundish Haha just highlighting some counter arguments to the positives mate
@nettyswill @JasonRoberts21 Doubt it. Played decently against Newcastle imo
@DanKennett @simonbrundish Regressed many players too. Borini, Markovic, Sahin, Alberto, Manquillo etc are a few examples

@HenryJackson87 @beatznp and need changes
@HenryJackson87 @beatznp Nope. I am not but FSG will but unless we atleast compete till the final game for CL it has been a shit season...
@IamJoshJackson @HenryJackson87 typo, meant manager
@beatznp @HenryJackson87 no with right scouting it doesn't, look at Soton
@HenryJackson87 @yox2814 Rodgers more seasons but most likely we will bottle against West Brom and Chelsea
@HenryJackson87 @yox2814 Debatable if we are in contention or not. We need City to slip up badly, if we make top 4 will be happy to give...
@jacklusby_ will be loaned and wasted like Ilori,Alberto etc
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 Solid maybe but good enough to start? Absolutely not.
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 same resources but we have a good core and we need world class manager to develop it
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 City was always shit mate but they invested money, appointed right manager and won two leagues. Not saying FSG has
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 I can't see it in all honesty. Not a negative view but an honest one
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 a team in which Allen and Lovren plays is not an improvement. Where have we improved from 2012 season?
@HenryJackson87 @yox2814 down the abyss
@HenryJackson87 @yox2814 I'm all for giving Rodgers another season but what if we finish 7th and no trophies? More money wasted and deeper
@HenryJackson87 @yox2814 I agree but if we don't want to be the best then can we be the best? We shouldn't be content with mediocrity...
@HenryJackson87 we didn't have quality to win against United tbh
@HenryJackson87 My opinion was that we lost top 4 in the summer itself, our transfers were terrible and it affected the entire season...
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 My question is are we out of the dark years? Our squad is still terrible after 212 mn investment! Speaks volumes
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 and getting outclassed by Sherwood's Aston Villa
@yox2814 @HenryJackson87 Sorry mate I for one am not happy with two semis we are Liverpool FC and shouldn't be happy with reaching semis
@HenryJackson87 Wages are a problem but reputation of managers counts a lot
@HenryJackson87 Are we in top 4 race? Highly unlikely we will get it and situation was pertaining to lack of good players attracted to us
@HenryJackson87 so if there is a manager with a better track record and one who can work under a DoF I'd go for him
@HenryJackson87 Yup and it got us back to this situation a year later. Giving him another season has same risk as appointing a new manager..
@HenryJackson87 im not being unfair here mate. Rodgers is a good manager but I don't think we can afford his learning curve
@HenryJackson87 3 years. Must have spent a fraction of that
@HenryJackson87 because of injuries and their wage bill is probably half of ours , Dortmund sells every year and he didn't spend 212mn in...
@HenryJackson87 extra to succeed and I think Klopp has a track record of providing that at the highest level
@HenryJackson87 yes there were but as I said it was the perfect storm, doesn't happen to every manager and we are stuck atm need something..
@HenryJackson87 I hope we don't let go of it on some stupid sentimentality that we are Liverpool and we are loyal to managers nonsense
@HenryJackson87 crap in transfer market. Pressing reset is the best option, now we have an opportunity to get best man in Europe...
@HenryJackson87 ahead of us financially and our young talents want to leave us for better clubs moreover when we are buying absolute...
@HenryJackson87 ask ourselves if we can allow the same amount of time when clubs like City Chelsea Arsenal and United are already way...
@HenryJackson87 of English footballers playing for him. This contributed a lot to his development and it was the perfect storm. We should...
@HenryJackson87 was in turmoil after Hillsborough and Souness. He had hiccups and he developed the team then he had the best generation...
@HenryJackson87 Lazy argument tbh. Fergie started managing United in pre PL era when there was no Chelsea or City moreover when Liverpool..
@Kita___K why even talk about CDM? We had Sahin and we played him as AM and any team with Lovren and Allen doesn't deserve to be in CL
@jackwfootball @LfcDan @mclloyd10 @DJ__Shanks I would give him another season of we at least win 5 matches of last 6
@Kita___K @jackwfootball Second that
@jackwfootball Which is his fault at many levels, how much ever committee is blamed, he spent 50 mm on Lovren Lallana and Lambert!
@TalkingAnfield We will probably go for Ings instead of a talent like Depay
@TalkingAnfield not a very reliable source is it?
@Kita___K be a white walker supporter and ending will be Daenarys against Jon or something like that
@Kita___K I don't think anyone will sit on iron throne tbh. Also I don't think Jon will be one of the heads of the Dragon, I feel he will...
@Kita___K Well as of now he is not confirmed to be alive right? Martin hasn't confirmed him for WoW yet
@Kita___K Can't develop a character so much to simply waste the story line
@Kita___K But if it wasn't relevant I don't think it would have been introduced in the series,Jon is special that's the only explanation
@stehoare @jackwfootball Not a big name manager and that affects player recruitment, can't blame only committee and FSG
@stehoare @jackwfootball Also do tell me why Sahin and Markovic are ill treated and let's not even start about Balotelli.
@Kita___K Umm he won't I won't spoil it for you though <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@Kita___K big spoiler she gave out
@Kita___K Stark Targaeryan apparently. Slowly introduced Rhaegar and Lyanna into story line yesterday and Sansa said Rhaegar raped Lyanna
@atrivedi99 I wonder why Lambert came in. Human full time whistle
@stehoare If Klopp is available we should certainly look into that option
@stehoare I like Brendan too but he has issues and his learning curve is coming at our expense, club is more important than the manager imo
@stehoare offer I think he can do a lot better with us
@stehoare Klopp did well at Dortmund with a much lesser wage bill and with the wages we offer and the transfer budget we are willing to...
@stehoare Agreed but if there was an upgrade available on the current manager would you take it?
@biibsi Exactly. The way Delph breezed through our midfield today. Shocking
@biibsi Learning from your mistakes is important but he never seems to learn
@Karlton81 Question is whether we can afford it. Rodgers was a gamble and I wonder whether it has paid off
@Karlton81 a simple thing we all do in all projects be it engineering or finance. Football is no different
@Karlton81 Uncertainty is the problem. 3 years into a project if we are still unsure of the result then it's time to scrutinize it.
@GraemeKelly1 @Kman316 on Borini Allen and related dross. So how are we saying Rodgers has no say at all?
@GraemeKelly1 @Kman316 I don't get it, wasn't Lallana Lovren and Lambert his choice? Fair 50 mm busted on his choice. Same with 25 mn...
@ViktorFagerLFC Not calling for BR to be sacked but he needs a fair amount of scrutiny and if better candidate is available then move him on
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x worst performance in Wembley in my memory
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x I ve always been a fair critic of BR, never had a bias against him but today's result is simply terrible
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x unfortunately Gerrard took the blame though we woul  have never won that match
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x At the end of the day City won the title and we didn't, Rodgers was naive against Chelsea and it cost us but
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x Yes we did well there then but we thought we won the league that day and messed it all up later
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x in race for top 4. All crucial games for me
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x Basel would have qualified us for CL, Villa would have got us into semis, Arsenal and United games would keep us...
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x those games defined our last two seasons.Yes league comprises of 38 games but Chelsea game would have decided title
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x Chelsea last season,Arsenal &amp; United this season, Basel this season , Villa this season. Rest my case.
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x He is on a learning curve but we can't afford it
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x Same has been happening at all crucial situations for last 3 years mate. Rodgers bottle it every time
@Karlton81 something isn't right with the plan
@Karlton81 I don't believe in starting another 5 year plan but after 3 years if you're uncertain of the direction of the plan then...
@Karlton81 Herrera wasn't last year mate , neither was Blind. Both of them have made a huge difference
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x tactics and hunger not the squad
@ViktorFagerLFC @pelle2x Mate but let me ask you one thing, did Villa have a better team than us? It's a cup final and it was down to...
@Nina_LFC @Jay_78_ Will they do nothing in summer? Hard to see that happening especially after such a shit season
@Kman316 @ViktorFagerLFC Graeme Kelly doesn't know about FSG mate, none of us do but it's hard to see them do nothing in summer
It sucks when life has no purpose or meaning and unfortunately we all need something to drive us forward
Quarter life crisis
Future is shit like past #TyrionLannister
Such a blah mood today!
@LFCZA He is another average mediocre British player. I don't know whether we scout at all
@Moley_LFCDT that's exactly why we want him. We love average over priced over hyped British players

@RaksMistry Yes only if Rodgers leave or he concedes that he is shit in transfers we have some hope
@RaksMistry Will be happy if Ings go to United and if we get someone like Vietto
@RaksMistry @sbates_peopIe also interested in him. Moreover these players don't sell shirts, United will sign better players
@RaksMistry @sbates_peopIe Ings came out and said recently nothing is agreed and he hasn't decided where to go, same with Clyne and Chelsea
@RaksMistry @sbates_peopIe Load of crap
@sriraghkarat #daredevilnetflix

@SamuelAdams89 @Jay_78_ @goodlad34 @Mark_O_Brien94 @southcirc Irrespective of where we finish I can see FSG appointing a DoF
@SamuelAdams89 @Jay_78_ @goodlad34 @Mark_O_Brien94 @southcirc depends on league position. Totally independent of Cup
@SamuelAdams89 @Jay_78_ @goodlad34 @Mark_O_Brien94 @southcirc As you said I am sure there will be a review for Rodgers and his position...
@SamuelAdams89 @K_Willzzz @EmreTheTank @southcirc @Jay_78_ last season was the season where we had the money to make things right messed it
@Jay_78_ @SamuelAdams89 That's good imo. Rodgers deserves another season but will he still have a lot of say in transfers? I hope not
Will FSG go for Klopp? I really doubt it but they did want him before appointing Rodgers. Anything on this? @SamuelAdams89 @Jay_78_
People actually linking us with Oscar and Falcao. Jesus wept
@_CallumMWright Ok Oscar one wasn't the worst
@_CallumMWright @oscar8 Worst transfer rumor of the day
@LFCZA He is right. Skrtel back at the right time, I hope Lovren doesn't play. He is a ticking time bomb
@dezert_fox Yup that's understood. We are terrible at transfers
@devincf @AwesomEmergency From LA  which is worse
@dezert_fox Marinez is a South American Bendtner
@dezert_fox Jackson Martinez is a South American Bendtner
@AwesomEmergency @devincf Blind guy living in an apartment without anyone to support and has no social life, doesn't need a lot of money
@jagdesh hope it makes him insecure enough to be ok with the appointment of a DoF
@John_W_Henry Mate Reus and Klopp please
@emptyMINDZ haha true that mate. No offense to Rodgers but Klopp is at a different level to him. He is a winner
@JohnCull_AI young and developing club with much more resources and in no hurry to sell, key is we offer him more time I believe
Klopp is a pipedream
Klopp to Madrid just sounds wrong. Madrid is the anti thesis of Klopp teams, I don't see him lasting too long there
@MattyT_EFC @MercyRuled @Everton LOL
@Jay82_LFC but nevertheless
@Jay82_LFC Question is whether we need to go for Klopp when he failed at Dortmund miserably this season. Injuries and other issues exist..
@Jay82_LFC what's the need to sack BR? Klopp is a great manager but BR deserves another year
@br_uk will suit well with us. @LFC care to put in a bid ?
@LFCZA he is gone soon then
@HenryJackson87 Barkley,Stones,Coleman
If @priyankac19 can believe Rahul Gandhi is a leader then she her believing @ankitlal is not suprising #AnkitLal
@sriraghkarat #AnkitLal
Ankit Lal and Photoshop, a better love story than twilight
@Jay82_LFC Lacazette and Aurier are ambitious imo
@HenryJackson87 Scenes of we but Ashley Williams in summer
@PortuBall heard Carvalho has had a poor season? Shouldn't that drop the price?

Rodgers: 
#Daredevil is the best ever superhero TV show imo
Gerrard leaving Liverpool still hasn't sunk in for me
Lovren has contributed more to this season than Lambert
Have we ever won when Allen scored? I hope this is the first time
Why do we take corners? We should simply put it for a goal kick
Add another 50k to his contract
@Himanshu_Lfc the fans must be rewarded with free season tickets for watching him
@AnfieldHQ96 he just announced he is an idiot in public
@JamesPearceEcho @LFCZA Are Liverpool looking for a top striker other than Ings?
@IBNLiveBuzz @ibnlive please. Don't
@mario_aquilina or will we ?
@_CallumMWright Seriously? Hahaha I actually believe it. We are that bad at transfers
@firstpost ok wasn't this the same guy who said Hindu women must have 4 children? Lol
Sometimes that one thing you love the most is what you must let go
Earthquake in LA? Didn't even feel it :/
@sagarikaghose The reverse is true too. Politicians are an easy target for the media.
@dezert_fox I doubt we could have done either. Both Van Gaal and Arsene are tactically better and has better players
@dezert_fox I agree. Lot if grandstanding idiots who refuse to accept the reality
Brendan is a good coach and he will suit us if his transfer and media duties are taken away from him
@dezert_fox half of all football fans. There's an equal share of idiots in all football clubs
@dezert_fox He is getting sacked soon and a lot of idiots are going to ask FSG to replace BR with him

Virat : 1 | Gayle : 0
@lipibatra Yup. She said she is leaving the job so I have to speak to the new guy. Will do that :)
@lipibatra Umm shamy scenes?

@Himanshu_Lfc unless we have 50-60 mn pumped into club on wages then we will be back among big shots but currently we are not
@Himanshu_Lfc we are unfortunately a small time club now. Harsh truth.
@emptyMINDZ Toilet paper mate
@Nina_LFC Worse. We don't even get paid much for it. United at least gets a lot of money for shit kits


Heroes live among us and @Gen_VKSingh is one of them!
@_CallumMWright @IndigoLFC One of the reason England is still shit in football, technical ability and stats are still not appreciated
@Jay_78_ @Karlton81 Question is whether we are finally interested in a DM
@Robbie9Fowler happy birthday GOD almighty!
@Carlos_aka_Bala @pboro5times too much transfer powers. We will do a lot better with a DoF
@Carlos_aka_Bala @pboro5times Rodgers is a brilliant coach but a man who thinks Joe Allen, Lovren etc are good players shouldn't be given..
@Carlos_aka_Bala @pboro5times Total non sense. Lovren Lallana and Lambert were his buys and the whole world knows that.Those 3 flopped most
@pboro5times Shouldn't sack the manager but we need a DoF to get better players. Rodgers can't attract good players unfortunately
Any midfield that has Allen as a starter doesn't deserve to be in top 4
@jagdesh agreed. Missing 4th is a huge problem which people are happy to reject

@HenryJackson87 not the same league and not the same financial scenario. The more time we take the further we move from top 4
@Priya_Menon @sagarcasm ROFL
@paul_tomkins the terrible 41 mn spent on Lovren and Balotelli nth of who were very questionable signings which cost us in the long run
@paul_tomkins agree to some of the points but the essential issue is simply that we could have done better this season if it wasn't for...
@Kieran_Nicol @emptyMINDZ Yup it's puzzling!
@emptyMINDZ heard Gerrard has major issues with Rodgers
@emptyMINDZ Buy 3-4 world class players, it's more than feasible but guess what we will go for Milner and Ings on free
@emptyMINDZ clearing the deadwood will clear up at least 500k per week. Complement squad with academy players and current crop
@emptyMINDZ I don't buy the we have no revenue crap, enough tv money is available, 300k per week freed up with Gerrard and Johnson leaving
@emptyMINDZ world class manager who will attract them and fight for the top 4. No brainer, within 2 seasons we would be in top 3
@emptyMINDZ Solution is simple. Scrap the whole creepy buy young policy, pay the money needed and buy some good mercenaries, get a ...
@emptyMINDZ Lovren? Kolo? Manquillo?
@_TheKopEnd_ @AnfieldHQ96 Not having a go at Rodgers but Emery is easily a better manager though he is under rated
@_TheKopEnd_ @AnfieldHQ96 He has tons of more experience than Rodgers and did all that with a shoestring budget
@_TheKopEnd_ @AnfieldHQ96 Emery won Europa league and consistently finished in top 4 with Sevilla and Valencia so can't even compare
@AnfieldHQ96 @_TheKopEnd_ Honestly I wouldn't mind if Rodgers leaves if it means we bring in someone like Unai Emery
@AnfieldHQ96 @_TheKopEnd_ He would have to work under the former Barca DoF there so if he accepts it then it's inconsistent
@RiseOfTheKop wtf, they actually think we ll sell him to them?
@stehoare @LfcDan @Marsh_JC We could compete when we had world class players like Luis Suarez not right now
@Himanshu_Lfc @sisteers Emery never got 214 mn pounds during his time at Valencia and Sevilla combined yet won a European trophy &amp; got CL
@Himanshu_Lfc I wonder where we'd be if Unai Emery had 214 mn pounds to spend.

Sacrificed our attack and only conc…
Sick and tired of everything, only solace is sleep
@LFCZA two options, be patient and see how current project works out or press reset, get a world class manager &amp; offer more wages to players
"You're so stupid to blame owner" in flat #AdarshTime 
SC judge complains for having to attend a Judges Conference…
@elninakauser if you seek justice then you have come to the wrong place
@simonbrundish but this will be essentially pressing the reset button on the whole model at which the club is presently run
@simonbrundish I agree with you, without CL the only way to attract top players is to pay top wages and bring in a top manager
@sagarikaghose @rosamundonline yup it clearly shows how flimsy the media is and how crazy a woman can get. Scary.
@DanKennett @stehoare the problem is that we are spending big bucks but on who exactly? Lallana? Lovren?Big bucks on right players is needed
@LfcDan might consider this as an opportunity to get a new personnel
@LfcDan I'm not inclined to sacking Rodgers but considering how difficult he is when it comes to transfers and appointing a DoF they...
@LfcDan you should be asking FSG that
@LfcDan not calling for his head but considering how ruthless FSG is it is possible for them to sack him if we finish 7th
...loop is by bringing in a world class manager and some world class players else we will go down the road like Villa,Leeds &amp; Nottingham did
I wouldn't want another season of transition by changing the manager but the only we way we look like we will get out of this transition...
Liverpool are unfortunately a mid table side at the best, last season was our break through to achieve success but we squandered it
I hope Arsenal has a shot at winning the league, would rather see them win than Mourinho
@jagdesh Don't see us getting out of this transition, we are unfortunately going down like Villa unless a sheikh or mafia lord comes in
Lol. The universe is nicely setting up for a Lovren header to win us the Blackburn game
@elninakauser there is your pity penalty :D
...big name if we are to attract players without CL
How long before Countinho, Can, Henderson etc ask the same question? I am not calling for the manager' s head but I believe we need a...
Sterling asked some very valid questions imo , where are we heading? We seem directionless and leaderless. Disheartening
@LFCZA but question is whether FSG will be willing to spend on experience as it's clear that current strategy is not helping
@LFCZA Spot on mate. FSG are ruthless, they can't afford another season of failure
@Jay82_LFC was lost when we decided to blow 50 mn on Lovren, Lallana and Lambert
@LFCZA tbh I will question the recruitment policy the most, this team has is very inexperienced and investing in potential is not helping
I can already see people calling for BR's head on my TL but the bigger question is whether we will ever succeed with a team of kids
2010: 80
2015: 55
Markovic lacks confidence, he needs to start more
For once 4 am - 8 am shift sounds appealing as I can watch #ARSvLIV <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Usually money is analogous to trophies but in our case it looks mutually exclusive
We lack it currently, we do not look like a club which wants to win trophies. We look like a club that wants to make more money
Until now we have built a successful business model but is that enough?We need more injection of cash, more wages and more intent to succeed
Despite Sterling's stupid interview he still has a valid point over our ability to be successful, is FSG project giving us success in sport?

A - Average
B - Below average
C - Can't have dinner 
D - Don't come home
F - Find a…

@JohnCull_AI it will be literally another transition season, rather stick with Rodgers for another season
Aidy Ward is the agent of Berahino and Morrison, Raheem should get some clue from that?
@HenryJackson87 so I don't see Sterling as innocent in the whole issue. Equally responsible
@HenryJackson87 Maybe but he was the one speaking in the interview at the end of the day and even admitted being flattered by Arsenal...
..is inexcusable and he has let down the manager,team and the fans in the process. He maybe ill advised but he needs to be more sensible
Whether he signs the contract or not is his problem but giving an unsanctioned interview before probably the most crucial game of the year..
The main issue most fans have with the Sterling interview is his lack of respect for the club and the timing of the interview
@HenryJackson87 the club protected him and developed him over last 3 years, we at least deserve some amount of respect on the issue from him
@HenryJackson87 I think most fans have issue with Sterling not because of the contract but because of his lack of respect for the club
@HenryJackson87 sure you would be but would you give an unsanctioned interview before most important match of the year?
Sterling plays well in one match and we all think he should be given 130 k contract!
AAP is loved by media because they're 24x365 entertainment!
@ibnlive @IBNLiveSports umm isn't that obvious?  What's the exclusive in it or the news for that matter?
Arvind Kejriwal wanted anarchy and looks like he got it!
Not arsed about our transfer dealings this summer. With our terrible history of transfers and United spending big again CL is far off dream
You know that something is wrong with you when there is a party next door and you prefer to sit at home and watch @CW_Arrow
Ultimate life dilemma comes in when you have to choose between sleep and free burgers!
TIMES NOW has pissed off many people today with their stupidity and cross examination of Indian team as armchair experts
Moreover Dhoni is the greatest Indian captain of all times. Yes he is better than Dada and Kapil, stop blaming him for the defeat
Indian media is an embarrassment. Best team won, appreciate that and move on. Being bad losers and pointing fingers doesn't help anyone
Rohit Sharma is the Lallana of Indian team. Average performance 9/10 times and one time he performs he gets praised
@latimes Is Ghost real or is it CGI? #askLATimes
@Saki_LFC @Himanshu_Lfc Don't see us selling him for less that £50 mn
@hunter_troll As you said, irrespective of who the manager is, the most important position is DoF right now.
@hunter_troll We fans always hope that we don't repeat our transfer mess ups but unfortunately the management doesn't learn
@hunter_troll Wouldnt be surprised if Lovren &amp; Lambert leave in summer but it wont happen if BR stays as it will be a blow tp his reputation
@hunter_troll Brendan's transfer record is very poor and its partially because of his affinity to PL and domestic players
@hunter_troll Yes Lallana Lambert and Lovren has flopped. All his signings. Moreno and Can has come good with Markovic being promising...
@hunter_troll I actually think he should stay, we can't be in constant transition and he has done well to turn the season around.
@hunter_troll @Gulinho_ Any chance of Brendan walking if we don't finish top 4 and FSG appoint a DoF?
Will be happy if India wins WC but would have been happier if De Villiers won it. Deserved it more than anyone.

Time to quit social media and crawl up under the bed. I despise human beings.
Terrible from Gerrard. His legacy will never be ruined but he is mentally not the same player he once was.
Lallana really needs to finish those chances. His end product has been bang on average
Players are yet to turn up. Terrible from us and United has played well.
@MasonRed4 @GraemeKelly1 Lazar?
Sturridge out and Markovic in? Zero pressing from Sturridge.  Lucas for Allen too. Allen unable to handle physicality.
Rajdeep Sardesai pmsing on my TL again. Need to unfollow him but it's good entertainment to see him cry victim
@sardesairajdeep Umm if you make a statement then you should answer questions about it to justify that statement. Ideals of true debate.
@sardesairajdeep @narendramodi No the leaders who led us in the last 66 years should answer that.
@Shannxo Search for Dave Hendericks. Annoying fella who has an agenda against some players.
@Shannxo He was having a relationship with himself
@Shannxo Hahaha their conversations were cringeworthy. Dave Hendericks used to flirt with 'her' too
@theraywilson Don't get why anyone would want Klopp or FdB atm. We are doing quite well with a good chance of top 4 and a trophy.All is well
Walcott to Liverpool makes no sense imo especially if it is at the cost of Sterling!
@dezert_fox @ViktorFagerLFC At least Sterling stays fit
@dezert_fox @ViktorFagerLFC Yup. Sterling is over rated too imo but if Walcott is worth 100 k per week Sterling is worth 130 k.
@Carra23 @Bruno_JFT96 Is England job that coveted? I honestly don't think a young manager would go for that job anymore. Pensioners paradise
If Bayern offers 50-60 mn for Sterling then I'd take it. Not worth that much. But we shouldn't sell him to City or Chelsea.
Star Sports must be desperately hoping for a Pakistan win so that they can quietly recycle the first Mauka ad.
@IndigoLFC a way superior player and he will be good if he can pick up that form.
@IndigoLFC I'm a Liverpool fan but that's a delusional statement to make. Sterling is better than him atm but before injury Walcott was....
If we are in CL next year we must avoid the embarrassment we went through this year. Need to at least make it to quarters.
Wouldn't agree with Carra on not starting Sturridge. Our main striker needs to start, can't start against United without our star player.
So excited and nervous about United match. It will define our season. If we win then I'm sure we ll get the top 4 spot!
@ViktorFagerLFC Villareal has some really talented players.
@ViktorFagerLFC Strong and a decent ball playing defender. I like him.
@alicechengg ok awesome :)
@alicechengg major?
@alicechengg Congratulations!
@lipibatra chill :P
@lipibatra Lol. You should keep your cool :P
@lipibatra nope. Very objective. Do what you want = personal freedom :P
@lipibatra Remember personal freedom talk. What's good and bad is subjective :P
@lipibatra Yes :D
@Anfieldlnsider Yes probably.  Imagine a defensive line up of Sakho Skrtel and Oatmendi. Will be impenetrable.
@Anfieldlnsider I do think Cahill is as good as Sakho or better. Has been excellent for Chelsea but Mourinho's defensive system adds to it
Imagine if Chelsea Liverpool Arsenal and United make top 4 with City dropping out. That will be something. Pre-2009 EPL memories!
@alicechengg Yup. Weird as hell :P
Mignolet is easily the most improved player of 2015 #LFC
A bit late to the party! But a good scrappy win against an excellent Swansea teams. Need to play the game of our lives against Scums now!
@PetrCech @hunter_troll @FinallyRaheem Haha you can instead come to a real club in Liverpool Peter! ;)
Just when you hoped for a Spurs win they play the most atrocious game of the season -_-
leaving. Will be happy with Vietto though. We can do better than Ings. #LFC
Imagine if we had a choice between Vietto and Ings and we go for the latter! Though I do think we need both with Ings, Balotelli &amp; Lambert..
Can't wait for the match on Monday! Hopefully a 4-0 b'day present from @LFC !
Its been 6 years since the 4-1 win at OT. I feel old.
#INDvsZIM 
People are partying during spring break and here I am sitting in front of my laptop -_-
@lipibatra -_-
@lipibatra suggest some good follows :P
Finally back to Twitter after 3 months!
