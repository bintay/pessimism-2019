“@GdnPolitics: Grant Shapps sacked from cabinet in Cameron’s reshuffle 
@R_Talz bloody hell, I start tomorrow and have three weeks! Look forward to some politics between 29th and 13th <WINKING FACE>
@R_Talz this Saturday?? Oh my, when did you start? And excellent, this is exciting <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@R_Talz yay! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>I'm staying around for two weeks until the 13th of June... Is that any good for you?
@R_Talz the 29th of May... Por qué?
@Diamond_Nerys exactly. Have you read recent interviews with the kings? They say they kept them apart because they enjoy provoking fans... <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@Diamond_Nerys same here, but K and A are the best thing about it. Also it's interesting that TGW only followed AP on twitter yesterday...
@Diamond_Nerys sorry I always favourite and never reply but I so agree: it's going to have to be one hell of a scene. It's so so frustrating
@MildlyEbullient oh life I've seen this far too many times to be healthy

@hannahwitton thank you Hannah for your tweeting today, keeping things sane <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
3.5/ 4 million votes for UKIP.  One of the more depressing figures of the night #GE0215
This is making me so fucking sick
I cannot listen to this #GE2015
Such ignorance, selfishness and lack of empathy is just so deeply shameful, this day is going to haunt us for so long #GE2015
Oh, Ed. I feel so awful for him #GE2015
Winchester was always going to be conservative, no surprises there
Oh aye here we go
Kennedy gone
@R_Talz which is an encouraging thought
I don't want to think about the consequences of what we've done tonight. But it's going to be utterly devastating for those most vulnerable
@R_Talz the consequences of this are going to be absolutely catastrophic. We've done so much damage tonight
@R_Talz yes same! Definitely up for this
@R_Talz I'm just so ashamed at what our country has done to ourselves, this is so so wrong
@R_Talz pleeeaaase I am so close to tears. Every time I see Cameron's face I am filled with such rage. Plus Vince cable is breaking my heart
Oh Vince.
@R_Talz I know, it's sickening. I just truly do not know what else we could have about it.
Boris Johnson is no idiot. He knows exactly what he's doing, his bumbling image is just a manipulative facade.
@R_Talz and the fact that farage has been allowed to dominate political discussion for so long
@R_Talz I blame it in part on this disgusting campaign the right wing press has launched, it's just so horribly vile.
@R_Talz I thought Miliband ran a pretty successful campaign, I just don't understand how anyone can justify voting tory, why anyone has?
@R_Talz I was honestly so hopeful and optimistic- but this is just so depressing. I really cannot take it in
Conservative majority would be simply catastrophic. I cannot believe this is even a possibility now. #GE2015
@LaraRowland_ I know. I just don't understand it. Nor why the hell tories have gone up. It's just so depressing
"English overall turnout down by 2%"
UKIP coming second and third in these seats is just scary #GE2015
@LaraRowland_ on despair
@LaraRowland_ I've also had a lot of alcohol to calm my nerves and now I just feel so ready for sleep
@LaraRowland_ I know but I can't sleep until I know
I don't understand how this is happening
Shit shit shit shit
Drowning sorrows with general elections cocktails 
@TheTrueRy ah gracias
@TheTrueRy right. may I join you? radio 4 keeps cutting out and giving me a heart attack. plus alcohol.
@TheTrueRy ahaha is it still busy? and could DEFinitely do with alcohol rn
@TheTrueRy I think I might in a bit, am swimming in despair alone over here
@TheTrueRy I think I might- don't think I could sleep not knowing. How is Glasshouse?
oh this is so so worrying
@MildlyEbullient ok no wait it's right 
@MildlyEbullient but I didn't think we had Tory, hang on imma research this shit
@MildlyEbullient how weird, that was not what I expected? Very confused- what did you get?

LAB 273 seats
CON 273
SNP 52
LD 27


After much hassle and stress, I have finally got myself a ticket for @RogerHodgson in Valencia. I have no words happy enough.
Oh that the World were full of Hoppy Hoppy Sparrows 
Tomorrow I'll go back to being in love with my course, but only after this damn Spanish oral is done

@ForniJess The world is a very confusing place that the two things feel equal sometimes.
.@ForniJess often very hard to feel that anything we do is important. And then I despair because I do badly on a single piece of work.
I spend so much time despairing over inequality and poverty and exploitation and greed and ignorance and cruelty and injustice, that it is
@TheTrueRy bless her she'd love it
@TheTrueRy ah bless you. Have you nominated her?
@TheTrueRy we did sections, but she wants to see that we've done some by Monday, not the whole thing. I'd just take the draft to Monday
@TheTrueRy oh baaabby. It wars actually a good seminar today
@RachelViking I don't think he will, he seems to be for it... And oh my. What a pun. I salute you. Ha
@TheTrueRy should have started your day with Lorena
.@ForniJess ...or he breaks a promise that no one is going to let him forget. It's a betrayal of someone either way.
Ed promising no SNP coalition is just dangerous: either he sticks to it and we get Cameron which is simply terrifying...
@18_goingon80 oh my, I do the EXACT same thing every time. Last week I cut myself on an egg cup. An egg cup.

I CANNOT CONTROL MY EMOTIONS
I MAY GET TO SEE @RogerHodgson IN VALENCIA<REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER E + REG> THIS WOULD BE THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER TO HAVE EVER HAPPENED EVER
@MildlyEbullient how strange... But I listened anyway and ein joyed it very much actually, more than I thought I would
@MildlyEbullient do I? I don't think so... Are you maybe thinking of Hannah?

@MildlyEbullient is it sad that I specifically remember two of these sunsets??
@TheTrueRy I'll only accept 100. I've not done the open paper, the syntax part D or the presentation. My need is dire
@TheTrueRy so that I can steal it please
@MildlyEbullient oh myyyyyyyyy these are beautiful. We HAVE to plan something, I am so up for all of these
@ConorBlanshard do you know what would float my literal boat? THE LAKE ON HES EAST. Ok now I'm going to do some syntax.
@ConorBlanshard well exactly. Marmite for one thing. Which I personally don't enjoy, but I know you do...And you're sort of proving my point
@ConorBlanshard Conor, I know how much you like hes East. Don't you to denying it. We have a better view of the sky for one thing
@ConorBlanshard you probably just don't understand as you live on an inferior campus
@ConorBlanshard I'm just so passionate about the sky up here that I couldn't be apart from it for too long
@ConorBlanshard si señor. It's actually quite nice being up here when it's quiet... When do you return?
@MildlyEbullient ahaha our little cleaning bonding sessions. Nah I'll clean tomorrow, I'm not living with that.
@MildlyEbullient I could have sworn you said excellent wankers then. That would have been an interesting twist.And yes please! We so cool
@MildlyEbullient ahahahaah would you like me to leave the stain for you to clean to your satisfaction when you get back? <WINKING FACE>
@MildlyEbullient Corey you underestimate our completely shit walking skills. I don't think I have to bring up last time...?
@MildlyEbullient Corey you absolute babe. Yes. That looks perfect. I don't go back down south until the 13th of June which gives us tiiime<PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
@MildlyEbullient well it's not that bad, I guess he just moves stuff around... Not sure about this stain though... 
@MildlyEbullient so update from the flat. Bathrooms: actually fine. Kitchen: let's not go there.
I don't know what I'm going to do next year without this view from my bedroom window. 
@MildlyEbullient also I have entirely new musical instruments to transport tomorrow. Behold, 
@MildlyEbullient oh I hadn't thought of that. I must depart, I am shit at packing and I kind of have to do it. Forgive me, o forgiving one.
@MildlyEbullient or maybe it will be break in the process and then he CAN'T use it anymore oh please oh please oh please
@MildlyEbullient don't you dare use Bertie, I'm inclined to use the bins. I remain hopeful. I'll let you know how much cleaning I have to do
@MildlyEbullient well I do not know, as I am not yet back, but I cannot waaaiiit to find out. Also I don't know how the kitchen will be...
@MildlyEbullient I'm hoping that "style" means "trip to evil eye within 1 hour of your arrival back home". Or I'm not letting you in. Honey.
@MildlyEbullient don't you palm me off with your fancy words, you're letting me live alone with harry and his (literal) shit for three days
@MildlyEbullient I myself am coming home tomorrow afternoon. That's too late my love, every step I walk without you is a stab in my heart. <BROKEN HEART>
@MildlyEbullient it's an intelligent world we live in. Also when are you coming hooommme?
@MildlyEbullient I particularly enjoyed this one 
I have barricaded myself in with books and chocolate, and am not leaving until I smell the roast dinner #HappyEaster 
@MildlyEbullient this IS a parody account, isn't it??
@MildlyEbullient Corey I don't know what you mean. My dancing is exquisite.
@MildlyEbullient I don't know, I love the build up too much... It's very difficult listening to it now and not getting very excited.
Natalie Bennett followed me on twitter today. This is very very exciting. Today has been a good day<BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️
I miss @MildlyEbullient lots. Also 4:46 is the exact moment, for future reference.<GREEN HEART> 
Today hasn't even really started yet, but I already feel like it's going to be pretty damn good <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Now can we have the one-on-one debate between Ed Miliband and David Cameron? Oh no wait, Cameron's too scared he'll lose.
I do not understand these polls saying that Farage was doing so well- where are these people thinking he won? So confused
This is why we need more women in politics #leadersdebate
@R_Talz I want to retweet this twice, she had that so so right
"Education about ability to learn, not ability to pay" YES.
 #leadersdebate 
I would suggest that Nigel Farage changes the record, but he hasn't got any other records to play #leadersdebate
Immigration reeeaaally isn't the issue here
Natalie Bennett is making a lot of sense actually
Nigel Farage just can't talk about anything apart from immigration #leadersdebate
Poor Jonny
Why doesn't Ed just say that it was the banks not the labour party?
I just don't understand where Farage is getting these numbers from?? #leadersdebate
So Cameron never has to answer a question first, but he gets to close two questions tonight?? This already sounds like an unfair "debate"

Have you ever seen a more attractive cup of tea @MollVF ? I think not 
@R_Talz there is of course no shame, I was starting to wonder if I should just tweet you instead<WINKING FACE> yes please, you fab fellow northerner xx
I have too much political rage and nowhere to direct it. I shall have to drink this cup of tea very angrily instead
I wish everyone would stop asking Ed about his brother, what's the point of it when we're 6 weeks away from a GE? #BattleForNumber10
Cameron should be forced into a one-on-one debate with Miliband, he shouldn't be able to back out because he knows it'll change things
I honestly do not understand how the Tories are still doing as well in the polls as Labour.
@R_Talz @18_goingon80 I don't understand how you can have a brain and be right wing..
Why am I never tired at convenient times of day?
@TheTrueRy Ahaaa oh rafa- at least he wasn't apologising to inanimate objects

Core 4 was horrific and I was wearing my top back to front all day without realising, but it doesn't matter because I'M FREEEEEEE!!!
Hoping that by some miracle, the examiners haven't put differential equations in the core 4 paper. Or parametrics. Or vectors. Or questions.
@itsovens @RachelHumpy
How am I supposed to sleep now that I have found this??? 
Seriously, why isn't Geo Unit 4 coursework???? Would make soooo much more sense...
I am so excited about having the time to actually read books again
@RachelHumpy oh pat! I think, that she wonderful was. Probably would I even Petra back have, although pat the best was.
@RachelHumpy definitely. Often can I mistakes in her speech hear, and I feel that she with the rbe quite bad been has.
@RachelHumpy sometimes think I that Nicola not knows, what about she speaks. Also can you not know until the results out come...
@RachelHumpy I believe that not. I am sure that you in the exam very good done have.
@RachelHumpy as if, you're really good at deutsch!
@RachelHumpy should that worry me?
@RachelHumpy I am so glad to have found another sceptic. Everyone seems to be obsessed...
@RachelHumpy YES!! I thought I was the only one who thought this!
I have literally never prepared for an exam like I have for geography unit 3.
I don't quite understand why it's more socially acceptable to have low self confidence than it is to feel good about yourself.
I never ever ever ever ever ever ever have to to do stats EVER again!! #freeeee

Hang on - it's December already???
@quartzbrained Thank you very much - UCAS seems to be deliberately irritating. But this is beautiful. I want it as my screensaver.
Ayyy well done child! Merit!!! Congratulations :-) @MollVF
Wanting an email from UCAS so badly that you misread the words "amazon special Christmas offer" for "offer from Exeter"
I give you... The German language. 
One day I will wake up and be completely energized and ready to face the day. Today is not that day. #sleep
Is it just me, or does I'm A Celebrity bear a distinct resemblance to the Hunger Games...?

"I don't want to go" 
Oh David, you kill me every time...
Five minutes!!! #DayoftheDoctor #SaveTheDay
Ucas: "something has changed in your application"
Track: "closed for maintenance
Me: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
OH MY LIFE. Still waiting to start breathing again. #CatchingFire

@pocketsizegeek this afternoon
@pocketsizegeek I am still laughing, I must have listened to them all at least 6 times each since you've gone, and they're getting funnier..
@MollVF where's that from?????
Everyone's getting uni offers and I haven't even applied yet... #waitforme
@R_Talz @pocketsizegeek Just to jump in here (sorry) does that mean that you don't need blank lines inbetween paragraphs?
@pocketsizegeek I've been struggling with 9 extra characters for days...
@Joannamaryr Can you imagine her on any sort of social networking site? She would be a complete nightmare..
@Joannamaryr I suppose so... xx
Is it the Christmas holidays yet?
I think this personal statement is actually starting to devour bits of my brain
You know you've reached a new low when you start making soup at two o'clock in the afternoon #Procrastination
@Sarah_Lambert22 Oh my life. So I just watched 'the name of the doctor'. I have so many questions and my head has just exploded...
@R_Talz that was supposed to say is. Please don't try and correct my grammar, it wasn't my fault, I am sorry...
@R_Talz that world map ostensibly driving you insane
Henna with @huffalow #18 
@MollVF you should be respectful and leave a space next to you where I should be.
@huffalow I have literally just set myself three alarms for tomorrow morning. I am not missing those damn trains.
