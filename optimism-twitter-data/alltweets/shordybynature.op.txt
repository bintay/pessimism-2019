This rain and no cable got thinking wayyyy too much. It's messing with my current mood
So if anybody on campus or in Bmore...<EYES>
Why don't I have cable? Because my HBCU didn't pay their bill

Johnny Manziel not being picked as a starter proves my point that the dude isn't as great as people thought he was
I wish football players could still do outlandish touchdown celebrations without getting fines

#PrayForBae 
I just feel like love song lyrics back in the day meant more than now. Now songs try to sing in a nice way "I'm just tryna fuck"
If any dude started singing Luther or Stevie Wonder to me, I would die <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I'm such an old music head
This showcase is like the All Star game except they play foreal
Dark Knight Rises <RELIEVED FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
If Morgan drops my schedule, all HELL will break loose
@_OhThatsTyyyy_ oh damn!
@_OhThatsTyyyy_ naw I haven't seen that picture. I don't even like him like that lol

@LeWhiteGirl_ shitttt I need one too
I haven't shopped at H&amp;M in the longest. And that's not like me
@nodnarBliL 5 I assume
@Tupac_HealsAll I changed my mind
Seeing Jennifer Hudson on tv the other day didn't help either <TIRED FACE>
As I go on this drive to get my hair done, I'm debating on my pixie cut again
They ask how ya doin?,I tell em better than you
Iggy's album is about to be apart of my workout playlist
Season Finale of Haves And Have Nots tonight <PENSIVE FACE><CRYING FACE><TIRED FACE>
Poor Hanna #PLL
It's like perfect running weather outside
These girls gotta learn lines and choreography. That should be double pay
Since I gotta restore my iPod, might as well take the time to organize my music from all these years I've been putting it off
If there's anybody I'm tryna be like, it's my cousin. That 6 figure job with paid travel, constant new car, and being HBIC sounds <THUMBS UP SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
People escalate a situation larger than what it is. There are things that matter more
Another school year where I'm all about myself and nobody else
Worst thing is knowing you're worth and still letting yourself go through some shit that you don't deserve
@itsme_ALLi lol naw I actually think HBCUs should try and diversify more
@itsme_ALLi the white man dont need anymore money from me
@SonicBravo finally looking grown lol
All I watch is movies with black people. If nobody black is in it,I'm not gonna be that interested in it *kanye shrug*
Hope Byron Scort get takes that coaching gig man ! #LakersNation
Is six flags the move today? See a bunch of people talking about going
<UNAMUSED FACE> that gate needs to stay broken. Hope somebody breaks it during move-in day. Not tryna fade a parking pass

Save up some extra money for that parking pass. 
<SWIMMER>time
I'm grateful for the hours but 2 straight days at 8:30 is torture
‚Äú@TheFlash84_: Proving Niggas Wrong This Year<OK HAND SIGN>‚Äù<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL> let's work

@MindofaMisfit I don't believe it <SLEEPING FACE>
@MindofaMisfit the lies ma!
I'm so black. I'm intrigued by anything Tyler Perry, except the Madea movies. I'm over those
The fact Jim pulled that off #omgjim
#HavesAndHaveNots got the biggest schemers and con artists I've ever seen in my life
They always bring these randoms on the show to get find out information #PLL
@Shaunificent @____YourDestiny I'll make a group chat tomorrow
@Shaunificent @____YourDestiny we might as well just make this a thing before school starts!
"She washes her hair with it." Only white people could pull off that excuse <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I wanna go to the aquarium when I get back to Baltimore
What's with these rats
This shift went by so fast.
Kyle's gonna end up just like Mia #HitTheFloor
This episode is <FIRE> #HitTheFloor
OMG that moment though <FLUSHED FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #HitTheFloor
Gym or a run in the morning is so necessary
I'm not trying to be so set in my ways early in life. I'm learning from my mistakes and trying to be greater than before
People are so temporary these days. Why even save numbers
I was right. There really was no point of making a sequel for "Think Like A Man".
One thing I hate is when my time is wasted
I'm exhausted. I'm probably not gonna wanna leave my bed tomorrow
People literally start acting up once you save their number <UNAMUSED FACE>
Carlos Boozer&gt;&gt; Pau Gasol
How many Step Up movies are they going to make
@CoCoRae_ ima text you later
If the Wizards get KD in 2016, their tickets will skyrocket in price and tickets bought
@CoCoRae_ nah not really. Wassup
I learn A LOT from my boys. So much that I know the signs of a good guy and a bad guy
I miss my guy friends <PENSIVE FACE>
Jhene Aiko, Schoolboy Q and Yo Gotti. I'd be satisfied #UP2UMSU
Ain't that the truth. New motto 
At least it finally got interesting. Found me a new show to watch
They don't show Nia Long enough in this show. She's the only known celebrity
@nodnarBliL I'm gonna stay at my store for the first few months of school
@nodnarBliL lol yeah
@nodnarBliL where you work
@nodnarBliL I just started at the one in Crofton
#whereisthebaby we know now. Thing is why I am not surprised
It's super cold in my house
Ooo she asking for a lot
It takes these girl 4 episodes to finally make some ground on clues. Mainly cause Spencer lost her touch
"A" gotta be the slickest, creepiest, and most intimidating person alive #PLL
Is it crazy that I still don't trust Ezra? #PLL
Bout to spend the rest of my day catching up on my shows
This sleep though <RELIEVED FACE><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@Dxrrick naww I drop mine too much with a case on it
@Dxrrick case-less is too risky
I'm watching the last two Harry Potter movies
Watch Jeremy Lin silence the haters this season #LakersNation
@Matty_Icy nope always and forever faithful to my lakers
@SolesAndHeaux he don't claim it lol
@_SmileForKyle <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> y'all got the most money out of every organization in the NBA. They just gotta know on who to spend it
@_SmileForKyle bet you're happy about Melo staying
And if the wizards get KD in 2016? I may finally root for the home team
Paul Pierce being with the Wizards is just odd
Melo basically wanna finish his career without a ring
Carmelo put the media through all that just to stay with the Knicks <UNAMUSED FACE>
This old man said "be careful miss. The ugly girls down there might try to fight you." Lol what a line
I hate when people call to ask me if I'm awake. Obviously I am now if I answered your call!
Damn I forgot today is free slurpee day
Jeremy Lin and a first round pick? Good pickup for my lakers
Need to go stack up on chargers
It's rare when my inbox is live
I break iphone 5 chargers like they're cheap <PENSIVE FACE>
Im about to fall asleep on everybody I'm texting
My legs hurt so I must have done something right in the gym yesterday
@DamnIt_Steve your head look like a boot ass
@DamnIt_Steve you the last person that should call someone boot ass
And why didn't nobody tell me Trigga is at PG Mall

HBO done messed around and put Best Man Holiday on <TIRED FACE><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@Maia_Magnif rightt. I have options I'm just not bouta to do the most for the little move that I have
Id rather somebody not text me back with a read receipt than not text me back with me knowing you got it. Be <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL> with my inbox
Fit includes nothing patriotic at all. Mainly cause I don't care lol
Time going by too quick
I'm tempted to drive down to the waterfront and get me a box of shrimp
I think it was the wrong time to be erasing numbers because I don't even know who just text me "Happy Fourth"
I have no moves for today <PENSIVE FACE> lil "me" time in my backyard
Sure..tell me anything I wanna hear
I do not endorse this Big 3 situation with Kobe, Melo and Lebron
I wouldn't mind my Lakers having another superstar, but I don't know if that will work well
I'm still upset they no longer have the fireworks at Allen Pond. It was so convenient <UNAMUSED FACE>
I need a hustle man
Gotta drop bread for a new tablet <UNAMUSED FACE>
@TaeCinco__ damn ok.
@TaeCinco__ you know anybody that fixes cracked screens?
All struggle leads to success
The people that do you wrong are gonna get theirs. Nothing good comes to evil people
Playing phone tag with @CoCoRae_  <EYES>
My sis definitely stated something so real yesterday.
I'm sure I'm gonna get irritated so I better bring headphones to keep my cool
@IgnorantLesbo yeah both were great. She just stopped after though lol

I'm just now getting Saturday night out my system <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Time to plot revenge Candice! Glad to see bae back on my screen <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #havesandhavenots
I'm slowly losing interest in Pretty Little Liars..
Gortat does not at all deserve that big of a contract
Tonight's episode of Haves and Have Nots determines if I will still be an avid viewer or not
All the things money can't buy
I'm deleting a bunch of numbers of people who were so temporary in my life
Humble yourself. You're not a G, keep it one with ya self
I'm in love with "problem" by Ariana Grande
It is hot as hell
Lakers hitting free agency hard
@king_kayshawn am I right?
The R&amp;B game is getting dead. Artists making trap soul music
Marsha Ambrosius got a new album? Definite cop
Some people listen to music all day just to tweet song punch lines 24/7
My boo Tamar. We keep it <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL> out here!
Son get off the stage! You rapping
If you was real, you'd say names when you throw shade
anybody who sings to you saying "sorry", should at least get the time to explain themselves
Robin Thicke up here begging
How you gonna cut Tyrese off?
Anybody who wins over Beyonce deserves credit
Weezy smacked. There's no doubt
Finally got another woman in hip hop
Nicki wish she wrote that song on the low
Hands down, Charlie Wilson's was the best lifetime performance BET Awards ever had

And I wouldn't have changed who I rode to the party with too. Lol
Played DJ, bartender, Cupid, and doctor last night <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> great turnup for my twin's birthday @2pacMentality
I'm looking forward to seeing Usher perform at the BET Awards. Just to see how he does "Good Kisser"
@CoCoRae_ wyd today?!
I am at a loss for words cause obviously there's no pleasing everybody
Obviously we wasn't ready
You know things not right if I'm ready to go back to Baltimore
@milhasrei <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> OMG
Might have to get <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><BEER MUG> this weekend
@milhasrei good!
If you can't get over someone calling you out your name, then you got insecurities
Why is this girl stuck on someone calling her a hoodrat? Let it go
Chillin like my ass doesn't have to get up early
@milhasrei <FLUSHED FACE>
Parents say "clean your room. So and so coming." I don't recall mr or ms so and so calling my room their place of residence
@_jayhuey sounds like what I need
@_jayhuey you've done it?
Is it weird that I wanna try yoga? I just wanna try it and understand the joy people get out of it

If I ever had bowling lanes in my house, I'd probably keep going till my arm fell off
Lemme find out they shot Candace... #HavesAndHaveNots
whatever I want, I could get. Trust and believe that
I love Ne-Yo sooo much. All his songs speak to me
People get so defensive when they know your advice is right
It's an awkward situation when the person tryna talk to you has cute friends lol
People from the outside sometimes see situations better than the person dealing with them
Mimi is so naive. Listen to your friends shawty.
I can tell when it's not a two-way street and I'm not one to force anything
That was episode was kind of dry
Bet Derek goes back to doing crack
I wish Hit The Floor was 2 hours every Monday

Kyle has become my favorite on this show
Idk if somebody going on a random liking spree of your Instagram means they miss you or they tryna go smack
I hate going to the gym around 6. That's when people get off
Since my shows come on tonight, I'm debating on going to the gym or going running
I have to remind myself peace and tranquility. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> Stay calm through all irritating and frustrating situations
Currently <HEADPHONE> 
I don't want no mediocre <RAISED HAND>
@swankeejay pretty much. No cockiness though lol
@swankeejay the lies and tricks? For sure
"Think Like A Man" didn't teach me anything I don't already know. You gotta play guys at their own game
@CoCoRae_ if it ain't a black movie, I  rarely pay to see it
