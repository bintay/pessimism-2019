Wowzers
I probably know every word to 200+ songs but I can't memorize a 4 phrase quote about leadership.
I'm such a mom sometimes
SPACE
Lol can't do this
I haven't talked to you in a year and 1/2 and you chose today of all days to message me
Compliment of the day: "I like your overall attitude"
Hi, stop, thanks.
Well dang man
I haven't been actually sick in months and I was just not ready for this
Thinking about how easy band camp is going to be makes me smile a lot tbh
Also just take a moment to appreciate this 
Kinda funny how the minute marching schedule is up I feel 200x better about everything <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
There's no need for that pal
Update 
And by that I mean I feel great and have had a wonderful day, but I know about the bs

"FLUTES DONT SUCK THEY BLOW" - WISE WORDS FROM MY BEAUTIFUL FATHER BRIAN ROWE
Sure
@franval416 your hot af and ily
I haven't gotten new music on my iPod since 8th grade, so long story short I just jammed to thrift shop and pumped up kicks on my walk.
I asked my dad about the heat wave payment and he just shrugged so I guess I'm going to sell my kidneys to march drum corps
I look more like a boy trying to be a girl than a girl trying to be anything
@thewindexcapade dick off mae
Yeah that makes sense
I just cut my bangs so that my hair could grow in all one length and I've never been so disappointed
Kinda just wanna play trombone
Nice tag though
Tracys grandkids are over and one of them used my bathroom and peed on the toilet seat I am more than disgusted
I can't wait to have shoulder length hair wow
True love <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>

WALK THE MOON IS COMING LATER THIS MONTH AND I JUST FOUND OUT BUT ITS ALREADY SOLD OUT JFC
Marissa told me I looked like honey on Wednesday and I've never related to something more.
There's a ginger at the beach holding a paper sign that says 'kiss me I'm desperate', and he still has more game than you
I've had my ear buds in for an hour and I never started playing music.
I said I was gonna start my homework but all I've started is the new season of amazing race
@lisatherealg I'm just preparing for the inevitable.
I just remembered that at the Seminole Comp the hot tarpon tenor player smiled at me for a good amount of time and now I'm just really happy
I really want to go camping
@laurabrirowe DO YOU EVER GET A LITTLE TEARY EYED BC NOW YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PPL AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT WOW
Can we go back to marching season?
Also I forgot I wasn't wearing pants and straight up walked to the kitchen in my underwear, so there's that.
Nightly reminder that no matter how shitty you feel, or what's going on in life, somewhere, there is a dog that is cute and happy as balls.
"Jesus fuck" and "shit balls" describe my emotions most of the time
@beatsbynicole love you nick <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm watching old supernatural episodes and so MUCH STUFF MAKES SENSE NOW WOW
Its kinda dumb that we have a set boundary of who we can talk to about what, I would just really like if everyone was chill with stuff.
Lol I started to get upset but I can't talk so nvm
Best show of my life
Update we got $386 worth if family photos
Jfc we do not need $300 worth of family photos
HI I JUST WON THREE STUFFED ANIMALS WITH 2 DOLLARS
I WANT TO STAY UP AND TALK TO CHRISSY BUT IM JUST SO TIRED
Its been almost a year since I've seen Chrissy, Savannah and Nathan and they're almost here I'm so happy i could cry
@beatsbynicole nick I love you
Actually kinda messed up that most of this generations "amazing opportunities" were taken away from them because of financial instability.
Just one more day til I get the brat back <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
IM SUPPOSED TO BE A PHOENIX NOT A FLAMINGO

Please stop you're making all of this really hard and i already fucked up a majority of it.
Just respect my decision.
I Yipped like a dog 5 times today and it's on multiple snap chat stories
Shit I love Mae jfc
I just miss being in that good of a mood all the time.
During marching season I could fall on my face, fail a test, &amp; stain my favorite shirt, &amp; still call it a good day bc I got a red starburst.
The real question is what happened to all my optimism
Ding dong I was wrong
"You won't hit your head"
Immediately gets dropped and hits head
I'm in such a great mood, today's gonna be good idk how but it just is.
I just love them both so much
Jake and Mae make me feel at home in the middle of a crowded beach
The hunger games just came on and mae is picking me up in 45 mins

Okay yeah but what happens when you can't speak to the person you've talked to non-stop for 7 months and is one of your closest friends
And I didn't get shit on by a bird so that's always a plus
The sunrise was gorgeous, I didn't step in gum, I passed the chem quiz, and my presentation went amazing. Find the good things in bad days.
And then aunt laura, Jesus why can't spring break just hurry up
Chris is coming down in 2 weeks. I can't wait to see Savannah jfc <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
They better actually use that work cause I spent a good amount of time putting it together
Sometimes when I'm having a bad day, I just remind my self of the booty I sent mae
I need money bc band but I can't get a job bc band
So I guess it perfectly summarized a really shitty week.
Not that I caught all my tosses and recovered when the bed didn't go my way.
The first thing said to me after coming off the floor was "watch your free arms &amp; technique, your 4s were lofty, &amp; you need more emotion."
I just burned the roof of my mouth on this chicken so its a great start to the day
Jfc
@laurabrirowe Still relevant, still not worked out, still not the end.
That was such a good conversation
I'm just saying I could've gone home right after school, but now I have to wait til 5:30 and its just not convenient ya'know.
Like yeah getting out early is cool but what's the point of a 30 min rehearsal with no sopranos or tenors and only 1/2 the altos and basses.
You can only go with the flow for so long before you hit an impasse, and I guess I'm there.
Lol don't talk down to me like I don't know how to cook. I just made you a legit meal and you guys idea of cooking is ordering pizza.
I just made the best salmon holy fuck
Why is your foundation 7x darker than your face
Heads up, B just passed me, so its an early morning for him.
Oh yeah this is totally productive
Me and Mae never did "wifeys" bc we were already in a completely gay relationship @thewindexcapade
@thewindexcapade Thanks bb
But my hand
I caught all those 4s holy fuck
Days like today that I really want my hair back
I mean at least I didn't get anything on my pants til after school
So many bobby pins, and yet I can only find like 3
@thewindexcapade When even
Wow I can read
I'm just really in the best mood today, but my body still hurts just everywhere.
@thewindexcapade accurate
THE LORAX IS ON IM SO EXCITED
I am made of blisters, ant bites, sore muscles, and numb fingers.
But my shoulders
@cvssiexo The bigger problem is that the water fountain in little c is legit on fire and the front office is just sending administration
Hold up the water fountain is on fire
Nguyen is refrigerating us
If B isn't gonna show up til 2 mins before the bell then I'm permanently adopting Wallace's room
Savannah is talking so much and I missed all of it jfc
Oh gosh that's not cool

Getting really good at finishing notes in less than an hour
Hi I love my butt I do not care
@beatsbynicole Love ya nick <FACE THROWING A KISS>

I've already eaten too much I'm gonna cry
I live for cheesy biscuits jfc
That could've been so bad
@laurabrirowe its been a month and the total is now 62; please make it stop.
My friends are too cute this is ridiculous
The real question is how did I get ready in 15 mins
Waiter looking slightly like Jensen ackles how am I supposed to feel about this
I just ate two avocados worth of guacamole jfc
I went from putting five difficult pieces together in 3 days to middle school band apparently so that's cool
Jfc
At this point my sexual orientation is Starbucks
My entire tumblr is just spongebob and the bikini bottom orchestra for halftime 2k16
But if you think about it last year Mrs. B and I were sitting on the couch judging the hot chilli peppers and eating Samoa's
Such a great day <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Its pretty ridiculous that the only thing I need to be a better player is to play with a better band
@thewindexcapade No one asked you nerd
I'm so funny wow
Do you take 84 years to travel around the sun because you're an anus
I keep on getting ready for bed at 7 and its getting to be a problem
Way too attached to everything
Like they're definitely the ones screwing shit up and moving things around js
Freshman IB are the explanation for most problems with are music program
Me and the band sub are one
@beatsbynicole Same
The sheer fact of the matter is that middle school me would be completely gay for present me and that makes me really proud
And for that I'm pretty thankful
Every once in a while I remember that so many other people are dealing with immature problems and for the most part I have my stuff together
Thank you Ian
"Like do yoga"
I FINISHED MY APUSH NOTES IN LESS THAN AN HOUR GO ME

"Things will work out in the end, and if its not worked out, then its obviously not the end"
Idk I just love when ppl ask my advice, completely disregard it, and then the exact shit I warned them about happens, its just great
Lol what did I say like 2 months ago, but of course it didn't matter then
Sometimes my eyes are just really great
I beat Maria at trivia crack 
There's a kid screaming bloody murder outside and I'm not sure if he's actually hurt or just six
I love being shot down about something I obviously care about cool lol
I've been emailed by 5 colleges in the past week just because of my PSAT scores please make it stop
When did I stop singing
I'm sorry
I'm in love with klapka atm
Like imagine being an adult &amp; having a kid who's ~15,16,17 &amp; them telling you that they know who they are, how ridiculous does that sound.
You're not supposed to have it figured out you're a freaking teenager my gosh
I should've just stayed home
If you love yourself, don't pencil in your eyebrows
@bigvaginazneq You're right I could just shave my head
I'm literally only wearing these shoes to piss off Mae
So I get dress coded for tights with shorts covering everything, but you can wear leggings that I can see your cellulite through
My biggest problem is probably over thinking to the point where I'm not sure if 1/2 of my vocabulary are even words
Hi I'm laura and I took the skin off of my fingers via a guard floor
Its such a nice day
@beatsbynicole Love you nick
<TWO HEARTS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TWO HEARTS> love mae

Sorry that you made the wrong decisions, I can't help ignorance though.

If I ever get a job I'll probably just quietly whisper "do it for the tour fees" like everyday
Wise words from Brian Rowe
"You're like the son I never had but you're my daughter"
I want to go do things with people but I also don't want to get out of bed for 5 days

"A little Noel that can't play?"
When you're mad at bae and they ask to see your phone. 
Update I'm not doing those notes and I'll make some lame ass excuse tomorrow and pettingill won't take cause she's pettingill
Its my own fault though
I really don't want to go to school tomorrow without these notes being done but I do not physically have the time to do them.
I chose my friends correctly. 
Maybe I should've started my Apush work before noon today
Wow this is awkward please stop
Is she wearing pants???
Why am I so tired
Because the unspoken routine we have is kinda nice
"He can already say I love you, no, and uh oh"

If it makes you excited, but also scares the living hell out of you then you should give it a try.
Idk I just really like band 
After this year I'm probably never taking another ap course
I mean I have no idea where that butt came from but congrats; bonus points.
This weekend I learned that when I'm an adult I'm going to sleep on the couch bc sleeping in my room while home alone is terrifying.
@thewindexcapade done
@beatsbynicole luv you too babe
Today just got a lot better <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I spent 228 hours trying to perfect 8 minutes and I could not be more proud.

Summary 
Hi yeah I want to talk to you pls
Can my friends please be happy again
I try really hard to relate to everyone but there are just some people whose every action is ignorant.
Actually don't cry over hw, don't complete it and tell them to suck your ass cause you got a full nights rest <WHITE SMILING FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN><VICTORY HAND>
.... Just freaking smile with friends, and cry over hw, that's literally all you need to do
I just wish ppl would have a reality check that this is highschool and there's no need for any of these problems...
I always get disappointed by watching the movies to books I've read
Quick, someone throw me off a cliff
The list of things I need to do and the list of things I don't want to do are always the same list
Mr. B just got 100 notes <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
And I shouldn't of cut my hair because???? 
@beatsbynicole love you nick <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Shouldn't of had so much emotional attachment to hair
Guess who's turning 16 in two weeks and still has nothing planned for their birthday
I just like seeing my friends happy
@thewindexcapade same
@beatsbynicole we can go on my birthday and get this thing done
My dad just said I can get my septum pierced and I'm literally so shocked, I'm gonna ask him for a car next
And then 2nd grade happened 
Here enjoy toddler me in all her princess glory 
Not even gonna lie toddler me is freaking adorable, and if I ever have a kid they best be that cute cause damn
Everyone is at homecoming and I just 
Bringing an umbrella won't make my shoes drier
There are literally freshmen who have gotten their permit before me
There is an extreme possibility that my dad is a bigger band geek than I.
I was totally joking but everyone took me seriously- my autobiography
My ankle doesn't hurt as bad is it did last night and I'm not dead so that's cool <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I just walked into two couples making out consecutively I'm going to throw up
@dylan_boniface  happy birthday man!!!<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PARTY POPPER><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PARTY POPPER>
The school is crowded enough as it is could you assholes learn how to walk with some kind of purpose
These describe me so well 
Wow that sounded sad lmao
But it's all good cause he's like a friend tbh <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Everyone is hanging out with friends and I'm hanging out with my dog
<WHITE SMILING FACE> power of positivity right?
So I just realized that 1/2 the freshmen and like 2000 baby's and that's like wow
@L_isa57 YESSSSS GIRL IT IS MY SHOW
Mrs pettingale laughed at my joke and it honestly made my day.
What is all of this worth when I just go home defeated, I have forever and a day to find a career path and go to college, I'm only a kid now
I still don't have a first period so what's the point of even going
Also I'm only getting out of bed to go tanning and that's still a maybe.
Me: Today is the last day of summer
Dad: isn't that the band you like????
I hope the new French teacher doesn't have high expectations bc I don't remember much
Saying that you're not like pretentious people and implying that you are somehow better then people who are, makes you, in fact, pretentious
Kinda upset that I can't be in mads, but there's always the next two years :)

Key points for Sophia
A: stop calling me
B: do not hang up by saying 'I love you'
Dear bird cooing out of time with the music, please fucking stop

There's too many cute dogs in this world for you to be upset over someone not replying to your text.

I THINK ANYTHING I DECIDE TO WEAR IS AND YOU SHOULD STOP BEING SUCH A PIECE OF TRASH.
My new mission is to only wear short shorts and crop tops around Nevin. Like they're you go, is that appropriate clothing for my weight.
I don't want to think about this stuff
Freshman year is over &amp; it went by so fast, if the next three years are going to be like this then I need to try and make the best of them.
But now I'm bawling
Wow I didn't think I would cry
