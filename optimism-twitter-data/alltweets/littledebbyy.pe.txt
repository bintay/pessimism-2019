I think my story was fire. I did the most time consuming thing over the break, that's probably why idc right now.
Obviously I can't seem to stand anything though. Help.
See I could have just taken regular classes, but they'd piss me off. I can't stand petty, busy work.
So then I can just work when I get home today.
@SprungOnLovely I didn't do a thing. I'm going to fold clothes... and see what time it is when I finish
I get unnecessary stress on my life because I just do too much.
@SprungOnLovely why did I go to sleep? Freaking help me.
