At the end of the day, both films will make a boatload of money &amp; should each crack $1B. Star Wars has Nostalgia but Avengers is here &amp; now.
Thor, Captain America, Iron Man etc. Have become household names but when I mention Han Solo, Darth Vader, The Force etc I get blank stares.
... And let's pretend the Star Wars prequels never existed cos they were so bad. And have now left a bad memory in the minds of most people.
Everyone has seen The Avengers or at least one of the solo Movies, but a lot of people haven't seen the original Star Wars Trilogy.
Avengers 2 will make more money than Star Wars VII. Star Wars may edge it in the US but Avengers has the wider global appeal &amp; recognition.

SAF was the last airbender. The first &amp; last of his name. So all we have now is to hope Utd make top 4 &amp; move on from there @dunmistakable1
Yeah you did. That's an argument for another day. I'm interested in knowing what you think United's current problems are. @dunmistakable1
Money actually does win trophies, Chelsea, Man City, PSG. But forget that. Please, what are those issues cos I'm stumped @dunmistakable1
I never expected any silverware thus season, but the team should be playing much better regardless of the transition. @dunmistakable1
Good point, but you have to consider that 1. It's Man Utd 2. LVG'S pedigree &amp; 3. All the money that was spent on new players @dunmistakable1
@dunmistakable1 Agreed. So am I being objective or subjective? And if you disagree with me, please could you objectively tell me why.
The rumour mill says Madrid want to sack Ancelotti. If they do, he should be rest assured that he will be highly welcome at Old Trafford.
Every 4 years, It's the same old song &amp; dance. Previously incompetent public officers start to display a high level of competence for votes.
"A team in transition", is not a good argument in defence of Man Utd 's current woes. Chelsea in 03/04 were a team in transition.

What is the supposed to even mean?
Listening to Logic's Under Pressure album. 
A much better performance from Man Utd after the formation change. I hope Van Gaal has taken note.
Another laboured performance from Utd, but we got the three points. De Gea our saviour once more. 3-5-2 needs to die a thousand deaths.
Wilson!!!!  Good for him.
That was his chance and he blew it. Sorry Falcao.
Van Gaal must have read some of our tweets.
That is what happens when you don't play 3-5-2. Good goal from Fellaini.
If LVG continues with his stubbornness, Man Utd will have another horror season worse than the last. This has to stop, no silver lining here

Nothing is decided at the beginning or middle of the season. So all this same points nonsense is meaningless at this stage.
Man Utd have been playing poorly for a while now and getting away with it. Today, their luck just ran out. LVG needs to review his tactics.
What we need right now, is a good hypnotist that will remove all memory of and desire to use 3-5-2 from LVG's mind.
A number of players have been sub-par today, but IMO, the bulk of the blame has to go to LVG and his tactics.

The hypocritical, prudish, sanctimonious, holier-than-thou BS of some people is staggering. Seriously?! Damn!
Atiku came third. Wow, that's a blow. I had had him at a close second. He will need to re-evaluate some of his relationships now.
@kaysclose yeah, that would work too.
A wise man does not burn his bridges, until he first knows he can part the waters.
All the APC candidates have their flaws &amp; a fews skeletons in their cupboards. However, Atiku is the one that makes the most sense to me.

LT. Charles Marimow is the absolute worst. It's a good thing he didn't last long.
I don't have the time,energy or desire to explain it to you. Even if i did, you wouldn't understand.
@ednoholdsbarred thanks for the suggestion, but that would be of no use to me. Why would i want to live in delusion?
2014 needs to end already.
@_kolajo Yeah genius, but a pretentious genius. He's a little to smug for my liking. He makes good movies though.
@_kolajo I can't definitely say for now, but one film that comes to mind is, 'The Prestige'.

Nine down, three to go. To God be the glory. #Destiny2015
Not the best performance, but we got the win and that's all that matters for now. We're also up to Third which is fantastic. #MUFC
Man Utd really need to cut out all of these individual errors.
De Gea is doing his impression of a brick wall again. It's really good.
Goal!!! Van Persie is back!?
United are just giving the ball away like it's toxic. Get it together boys!
It seems like the body snatchers have brought back the real Fellaini.
Another match another injury. Why?
Ian Rush said if i don't drink my milk, i'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. Accrington Stanley? Who are they? Exactly!
@mayorfergie I seriously hope not, lightning won't strike twice. Those were the dark days, i believe we're passed that now.
Accrington or Yeovil Vs. Man Utd in the FA Cup third round. The gods have smiled on us. #MUFC
And LVG is back to 3-5-2. I really do not like that formation. I hope it works today though, 3 points are very important.

This match is like Man Utd vs. Man Utd B.
I thought Rooney was rested or something. Just found out he picked up an injury. #Sigh
And Rooney is nowhere to be found. Can't say i'm surprised though. Would have liked a Falcao start, but i hope Wilson does well.

I'm very good at agreeing with people, even when they are saying stupid an illogical things so they'll keep quiet and leave me alone.
However, If they were still on the ship, it probably would not be sinking now. I wonder what went wrong. 2/2
Gotze and Lewandowski are probably happy they're not part of the sinking ship that is Borussia Dortumund anymore. 1/2
Ander Herrera is something special. LVG needs to devise a system that enables him to play all the time as long as he's fit. #MUFC
Thank you Jesus for today. Stressful as usual, but still awesome.

I'm not a fan of the horror genre. 'Drag Me To Hell' &amp; 'The Cabin In The Woods', are the only horror films i've enjoyed in recent times.
I just started reading this online graphic novel called 'Out There', by R.C. Monroe. It's quite good. 
Just because it's become a societal norm, doesn't mean it's acceptable.
Apparently, Warner Bros. Has a "No Joke" mandate that applies to all DC cinematic universe films. Why have i just heard of this?
It's a good thing i stuck with Aguero... I hope. #FPL
A loose tongue is indicative of an empty brain.
A comfortable win in a match we dominated. Things are finally begining to click and we are getting better. #MUFC
RVP!! He silences his critics with a great goal 3-0.
The rise of Fellaini and the decline of Van Persie. From zero to hero and vice versa
When Smalling has his head screwed on properly, he is actually quite good.
Rooney!! My man.
Please, let us all pray for Van Persie. He needs to get back to his best fast.
Please not another Injury, please.
Goal!! With an assist from goal-line technology.
Damn it! Another injury. Di Maria was looking bright in early exchanges. I hope it's not serious.
LVG does it again. Another unpredictable lineup. At least Mata starts and Falcao makes the bench. #MUFC
In addition to a win, i would also like to see a good performance today. The 1st half against Arsenal was painful to watch. #MUFC
"Boris? Why always Boris?"
It's here people. Star Wars: The Force Awakens teaser trailer. 
Another bomb blast in Kano. When will these heartless people stop? Our security forces are doing nowhere near enough, and that's on the FG.
Here's a crazy idea. Why not drop RVP, play Rooney as the main striker and Mata just behind him? It's out there, i know. #MUFC

I hope all these GEJ propagandists are just doing it for the money. If they seriously belive what they write &amp; say, then there's a problem.
@_kolajo Spot on. I Couldn't have said it better lol.
@_kolajo Nothing really lol. After seven films with varying levels of quality, franchise fatigue has set in. Also, i don't like FOX.
@_kolajo No opinion really. I hear he was good in 'Inside Llewyn Davis', but i've not seen it &amp; i'm not so interested in X-Men these days.

Liverpool lost again?? What is happening to those guys? I'm beginning to get worried.
What a day. I thank God for everything.
@_kolajo Can't really pick a favourite. It's between Crime Drama, Action-Adventure &amp; Sci-Fi. Rom Coms are my least favourite.
@_kolajo Critic's reception. The success of the transformers films show that the general audience is not very smart.
@woodzrc There was a film? I thought it was just a mini-series. I have not seen it though. I've heard great things about the book.
Stephen King's "The Stand" may be split into four films. I need to read that book as soon as possible.
Reading some of the tweets from disgruntled Arsenal fans. Great after match entertainment, lol.
Man Utd beat a mid-table club today. It is to be expected. #MUFC
Happy times on the ol' TL.
The three points are all that matter. Great result. #MUFC
Man Utd will always be greater than Arsenal. Always.
Rooney!!!! Who's your daddy?
LVG is beginning to see the light. RVP will soon stop starting.
Rooney was miles onside there. What is the linesman playing at?
Goal!!! Own goal or not, a goal is a goal.
Welbeck needs to realize or just accept that he is not as good as he thinks he is.
No shots on target for Man Utd in the first half. Now that's bad.
Mata for RVP and Herrera for Carrick in the second half.
At least we are not losing. United have to step up their game in the second half.
@mr_ooyf I see you're not a fan of Blackett. I think he was playing ok before he got sent off.
Has Blackett forgotten how to defend? He has not been playing well.
United have not settled yet, but they need to and fast.
Oh No! Shaw. Why is this happening?
Lord Moyes didn't lose to Arsenal. So LVG, you have no excuses.
Has Herrera become the new Mata? I hope not. We were playing better when he was starting. I'll just have to trust LVG on this one.
With the players starting, it looks like a 3-5-2 formation or some variation of that. #MUFC
Smalling, Blackett and McNair. These three will need a high level of discipline and composure today. Make us proud boys #MUFC
Ken Jeong has an M.D. and is a licensed physician. Wow! That blew my mind.

The moment you stop assuming that every person you meet, is a rationally thinking human being, the less problems you'll have.
@tboyadigun We'll see what happens tomorrow. A draw will not be ideal for either team.
@tboyadigun You cannot be so sure. Mourinho is the master of playing for a draw. I don't see LVG doong that.
If Utd don't win tomorrow, nobody will remember it. Hopefully, that will not be the case.
People are always quick to bring up 8-2 whenever #MUFC play AFC these days. We're not Liverpool and should stop living in the past.
I now have no reason to watch the African Nation's Cup. That is actually a good thing.

@gabriel5i Please tell me Meruem's death was worthwhile. I'm assuming someone eventually kills him.

So Chairman Netero died for nothing? Nonsense.

In trying to be everything, you usually end up being nothing.

Varane being available for the paltry sum of ¬£19M... unbelieveable. This needs to be true.
David Moyes needs to be left alone. Let him manage his first game at least.

The "Dan Iskan Guys". Superheroes United. 
A win is a win is a win. Three points in the bag. We'll build on this result and come out stronger in the next match. #MUFC
That is what Mata does!! Get in!
There is no scenario where it will be ok for the band, to sing about Honywell wheat meal at a naming ceremony.
There has to be a drastic improvement in the second half. The first half was highly disappointing.
Someone needs to remind these guys that you can't win if you don't score.
It's time. Come on boys! The importance of a win in this match, cannot be understated.
If only Mata was given the same chances Van Persie has been getting. Sorry bro.
Carrick starts and Blind plays in defence. A McNair and Blackett centre back combination is probably too risky.
"Ivanovic, what's he doing there?" Good question.
Wasteful Hazard. Chelsea should have been in the lead by now.
I've missed Herrera. I would like it if he started today.
Much thanks to goal-line technology.
Liverpool or Chelsea? Which team do i dislike the least?

@_kolajo Really? I liked it. What i didn't like, was Matt Damon's part. His actions were too predictable, saw it coming a mile away.
@_kolajo It doesn't have the general appeal of 'The Dark Knight' or 'Inception', but it's a solid Sci-Fi entry. #Interstellar

That was a good performance, regardless of the result. The sending off and the injuries were just unfortunate.
Van Persie is coming off??? My eyes must be playing tricks on me.
We may not get a better chance in this match. Damn!!
If United can get a result today, it will be a miracle. I believe in miracles. Come on United!!
Michael Oliver is the real MVP. His incompetence or brilliance has kept Man Utd in this match.
Man Utd's recent misfortune cannot be just mere bad lack. A grand conspiracy must be afoot. I blame the Illuminati.
Another defender added to the unavailable list. Great, just great.
Concentration levels need to be set to 1000 for the second half. It's not over yet. Come on United!
RVP and his passing allergy.

A full Etihad, is something you hardly ever see. All thanks to Man Utd.

@oyin_bumblebee Yes o, i'll be in church. Nothing shall seperate us from the Love of God. Not even Man Utd.

Goaaaaaaaal!!!!!
Can we recall Hernandez and give them Van Persie instead?
RVP! You had one job. SMH
I would really like to see James Wilson come on at some point during this match. He can't do worse than RVP.
Apart from the yellow, Rafael has been great so far. But can he be trusted to not pick up another one?
Awesome first half from two evenly matched teams. Man Utd could have been in front if a different striker was playing though.
Thank you Dave.
We're off! No Fear.

You're welcome <GRINNING FACE> "@She_Inobabpo: @TimiFrost it's not lol thank u!!!"
Happy Birthday!! @She_Inobabpo. I hope it's not too late? God bless.
@_Kolajo Yes my friend, sometimes you are <GRINNING FACE>.
Big news coming from Marvel Studios and DC/Warner. While Sony are just sitting in a corner scratching their heads.
#GiveSpidermanBack
The Simpsons as #Naruto characters. 
@_Kolajo I believe you are over thinking this whole thing. These movies are just live-action adaptations of comic books and nothing more.
Someone should tell Snoop that, old men picking on little girls is not cool. No matter how annoying said little girl may be.

A deal is a deal. You have no right to complain, after you have agreed to it. Even if you got the short end of the stick.
I liked Paul Scholes better when he didn't say much.
@meliz333 Yes, that would have helped a lot and fewer people would have died.
It may all just be in my head, but it seems like more attention is being paid to this whole thing since it got to America.
Since #Ebola got to the US, world health organizations and foreign governments have kicked into overdrive in order to contain it.
@_kolajo They were always going to do 'Civil War'. One movie won't finish the saga, so starting with Cap 3 is good. No worries.
So #Marvel is doing the 'Civil War' storyline, starting with Captain America 3. That is a wise move IMO.
My goals and aspirations have been minor league all this time and i didn't even know it. It's time to step into the 'Majors'.
The 'Archer' creators, will remove all traces of and references to 'ISIS', starting from season 6. Terrorists ruin everything.
Happy Birthday!! @godfwee. Have a great day and God bless.
@_kolajo That's an astute observation and a good point.
A T-Rex?! Seriously?! Nollywood has done it again.
@_kolajo Thank you sir. You're far too kind.
One mistake or failure, doesn't define your entire existence. Neither does one successful step or victory.
Sometimes i need to remember just to breathe. Sometimes i need you to stay away from me.
@stillsollo you are absolutely right.
@stillsollo it's a free world, knock yourself out.
Soldiers in active service, do not concern themselves with the affairs of everyday life.

Mediocrity and small-mindedness are terrible things. Avoid them like the plague.
Woe to him who does not do what he must do.
On the left side of life, all you have is mediocrity, pain and shame.
@jojo_suey you're welcome.
@_Kolajo Ok sir! I'll try lol.
Happy Birthday!! @jojo_suey. Enjoy the rest of your day, God bless.
@_kolajo lol. Yeah, you got me. Subtitles are a big chore and i try as much as possible to avoid them.
Happy Birthday!! @jojo _suey. Take care and God bless.
The anticipation of death, is worse than death itself.
@_kolajo i haven't seen most of those films. I don't watch many foreign language films.
@_kolajo I will see X-Men: Apocalypse on opening day, i just don't have a high level if excitement about it for now, but that could change.
@_kolajo Your points a valid, but at the end of the day, you go with what works for you. So if it's not your thing, you don't have to watch
@_kolajo The MCU films may not be the best, but they are close to their source and are highly entertaining &amp; that's all i want in a CBM.
@_kolajo Yes, for quite a while. The films are not bad but their character portrayal &amp; plot focus stray too from the source for me.
You do not have to bring another person down, in order to promote yourself.

@_kolajo It's ok, cos i've reached my 'X-Men' saturation point. I'm just glad that Wolverine won't be taking centre stage though.
#Prayer #20PPPTV
Good people risked their lives &amp; some even died to help contain the ebola virus. Now some stupid politicians want to take credit. SMH
Bruno Mars' "The Lazy Song", perfectly captures my mood today.
Another Cristiano Ronaldo Hat-Trick! How do you even start explaining that? I'm beginning to think he's an alien or something.
@_kolajo I haven't seen Gone Girl, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Locke, Boyhood, The Rover and some others, so things will change.
@_kolajo Nice. For me, Cap 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, Edge Of Tomorrow and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
I saw 'The Fault In Our Stars' yesterday and i think i'm in love with Shailene Woodley. That girl is simply amazing.
A Man Utd win is always great and an Arsenal loss is always a bonus.
Happy Birthday @zoe_no1. Have a great day.
So Welbeck has become a villain again. Make up your mind people!
This is my first good #FPL week of the season. Costa (captain), Kompany, Di Maria, Fabregas amongst others, coming good.
What a match! And i missed it, damn. 3 points, a Falcao goal, a saved penalty and an unusually long extra time period. Awesome.
My life is beautiful. I don't need the money, i don't need the fame, all i want is You. I've got no regrets... I'm doing just fine.
@_kolajo but sometimes i like nerve-shredding tension :-). There's nothing i can do about it though, c'est la vie.
Church Service ends by 12pm, then we have worker's meeting. The fixture computer should be turned into a toaster for fixing #MUFC at 12.
@missp000 be careful, it would be tragic if your phone fell inside the pot.
I hope Balotelli has now come to the realization that, no good can come from trolling Man Utd.
@mijean1 you're welcome.
@_kolajo Lol. Americans and their remakes, they'll never learn. I'll try and get my hands on a copy of the origanal.
@_kolajo that's interesting. I haven't seen Oldboy, but i heard that the American remake was a dud.
@_kolajo That's tricky cos they are so many. Lion King, The Incredibles, Spirited Away, Shrek, How to Train Your Dragon etc.
@_kolajo I still watch cartoons, but i like to call them animated series/movies now. I don't get up early to watch them though.
Waking up at 6am to watch cartoons on saturday morning.

@jeanetteeliz thank you :-)
What would the plot of a 'Tetris' movie even be? Come on Hollywood, you're better than this.
The 'Angry Birds' movie Is a silly idea, but at least it's got a great cast. Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph, Tony Hale, Pete Dinklage, J. Sudeikis
@jlpisjlpisjlp Really?! I wouldn't have noticed lol. I like it too and diss tracks in general. They make me laugh.
@jlpisjlpisjlp yeah, it was dead on arrival. But when a fellow rapper disses you, you just have to reply. Street cred is very important :-)
@jlpisjlpisjlp lol. Ouch! There is no coming back from that.

Fractured rib, damn! I hope Herrera won't be out for too long. We just can't seem to catch a break at the moment. #MUFC
Mid-week friendlies?? I'm sorry, but no. The risks far outweigh the rewards. #MUFC
Patiently Waiting...
@_kolajo you're right, but i don't think that Hugh Jackman will be playing the character for much longer.
The internet is like the Eye of Sauron. It sees everything.
All the 22 Jump Street fake sequels.

Whew! Now i can breathe. That was shaky, but the win and 3 points are all that matter.
Nail biting, edge of your seat times.
Rooney!!! Now that's how you silence your critics.
Every few years, Liverpool have a good run in the league that eventualy ends in disappointment. Then they revert to mediocrity.
@_kolajo I have. Back then i heard so much about it, but when i finally saw it, i was largely underwhelmed. I may have to rewatch.
Van Persie is using up all his extra lives and the effects of Rooney's invulnerability shield have not worn off yet. #MUFC
I feel for Mata, but right now, i don't really care who starts or doesn't. As long as the we get the 3 points, i'm good.
@_kolajo @nail_polish Huge shoes.
The only game release i really look forward to every year is Football Manager. FIFA? What is FIFA?
@_kolajo @nail_polish I like Nolan. I just hope this movie doesn't crash and burn.
@nail_polish @_kolajo Sometimes it's counter-productive to over hype a movie.
@_kolajo @nail_polish welcome back! For some inexplicable reason, i have no expectations for this movie. So lets see. It's 169mins long?
@nellysylva lol. Any form of help we can get is more than welcome. Affliction must not rise up the second time.
@nellysylva Yes we do. But i highly doubt that lightning will strike twice. But just in case, i lit 7 candles to aid our cause. Just kidding

Good away win for Southampton, Everton continue to be inconsistent and Liverpool are just being themselves.
Seven goals, two matches, one player. Ladies and gentlemen, i give you, Cristiano Ronaldo.
"Friends" is 20. I'm beginning to feel old now.
Edo G ft. Masta Ace - Wishing.
Rooney ran almost the entire length of the pitch to try &amp; recover the ball after Mata lost it. Not much has been said about that. #Biased
"LOST" premiered 10 years ago today. The show was awesome for a time but fell off towards the end. It's still a good show though.
Clattenburg: "Do you want to see a magic trick? Watch me make Man Utd's two goal lead, disappear."
#SpotTheReference
If Rooney deserves to be dropped, then Van Persie deserves to be dropped five times more. Just pair Falcao with James Wilson.
I can't stand insecure boyfriends. At the end of the day, she will leave with you. We were just talking and by the way, i knew her first.
The #EPL is like daytime television. So much drama.
It just had to be Lampard.
Don't Chelsea have a yellow jersey? The different shades of blue are doing a number on my eyes.
This is a good time to sing that "Let it Go" song. "The cold never bothered me anyway".
I can't remember if De Gea made a single save throughout the match. The guy hasn't been very good for some time now.
I'm already over this stupid match. I may not be able to forgive Clattenburg though.
@kvmtosh Thanks.
@tboyadigun I can't believe it either.
I'm not trying to make any excuses, but the officiating in this match has been atrocious.
I can't cry, so i'll laugh. This is a total and utter mess of epic proportions.
Shades of Moyes.
This is all Clattenburg's fault.
Super goal from Herrera.
Rojo has been a bit suspect at left back, but Blackett has been outstanding.
Di Maria you beauty. Great goal.
Leicester tried. They were able to keep a clean sheet for all of 13 minutes.
I'm not reading too much into LVG dropping Mata. I think he just wants to see Rooney, Falcao &amp; RVP play together in a competitive match.
@Opixxy No meeting! I'm So happy.
I just hope nobody calls for a meeting tomorrow after church.
"The Fappening" part 2. These guys need to get a life, girlfriends and Jesus.
A leaked album, would not be on iTunes. "Released without my consent", would be more appropriate.
@gooner_ads I was simply making a point. The match was years ago, so there is absolutely no reason for a debate now.
I'm happy for Hernandez though. Scoring twice is not bad at all.
An 8-2 win is impressive whichever way you look at it. But #MUFC did it against Arsenal with Young, Anderson &amp; Clevz in the starting XI.
@ruchelopaz alright then, at least i'm not the only one. :-)
@joechanning1 lol. Don't worry, i wont.
@jojo_suey you're welcome.
LVG always looks like he's in charge and knows what he is doing. Unlike that other guy who will not be named at this time.

A Deadpool movie is officialy in the works, with a release date and everything. O how we have waited.

DC need to lighten up. It doesn't have to be dark and gritty all the time. A little humor never hurt anybody.
@acrossthekeeper @devildart180 That would be letting them off easy.
@barneyzinsane Agreed. Drogba should not have started.
@barneyzinsane not sentiment, but hubris. Mourinho should know by now not to underrate any team in the UCL.
We can say, "Man Utd would have done better" all season long and nobody will be able to prove otherwise.

Jonas Gutierrez has cancer. That's terrible news. I really hope he can beat it.
Danny Welbeck is a Man Utd sleeper agent, who has been sent to destroy Arsenal from within.
The only fixture from today's UCL matches that interests me is Dortmund Vs. Arsenal. It will be nice to see Kagawa in action again.
The sun had to make do with a brief cameo today. Dark clouds and the rain took centre stage.
If i get a call from 2121, i know not to answer. But when 07056832696 calls, how am i supposed to know? Well played.

@_kolajo he said quite a lot. Check here ----&gt; 
Rio Ferdinand didn't pull any punches while talking about Moyes. I see there's some bad blood there.
Mark Zuckerberg got "The Social Network", but they gave Steve Jobs "Jobs". With everything the man achieved in his life, he deserves better.
@toyosioyebs it hasn't been easy, but the good thing is that it wasn't in vain.
3 points, 4 goals, a clean sheet and a great performance. What more could i ask for? It's party time. #MUFC
Blind and Rojo have not been very conspicuous, but they've been extremely effective.
Let's just chalk that Blackett mistake up to inexperiance and never speak of it again.
Valencia has only one move, but that is not even the problem. The problem is that everybody knows that move and he hasn't learnt a new one.
I've run out of superlatives to describe Angel Di Maria. What a player.
Why isn't Falcao warming up yet. As well as United have been playing, RVP has had minimal impact so far.
De Gea and his patented leg save.
"It's only QPR". When people run out of intelligent things to say, statements like that are made. #MUFC
@ManUtd fans are pleased with their team's first half performance. &lt;-------Understatement of the year!
Rooney!!! We're back! #MUFC
I don't think Van Persie is doing enough to warrant a starting place. Not with the attacking options we now have at our disposal.
De Gea! What was that!! Nice save from Evans.
Di Maria!!! Fooled everyone. Good goal.
Ashley Young will now have to get himself acclimatized with bench life.
Pereira makes the bench. It's sad that Man Utd doesn't give the youngsters a chance.
It's time! Man Utd for the win.
Match Day At Last! Any Type Of Win Will Be Good Enough For Me. A blitz wouldn't be bad either.
