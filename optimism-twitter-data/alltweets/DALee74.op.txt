Then, his mom looked up "why is there beer on the ceiling?" A buddy was crushing beer cans w his forehead &amp; there was splatter lol
I think the best cleaning up after a party in hs story I've heard the guy thought the place was spotless. And he *was* getting away with it
Hide the evidence!
Clearly, my dog doesn't understand that he's supposed to clean up after having a wild afternoon w his gf
The entire toy box has been emptied lol
Hemi had a playdate while I was out (friends needed to stash their dog for few hrs). Looks like they had fun 
No dad bod for Batman <FACE THROWING A KISS> thanks @zdarsky 
Howard 
Cream soda is not a beverage that is easily chugged
I like how my friend called (not texted!) 10min before we were supposed to meet that he was running late &amp; now I'm the 1 who has to rush lol
@searexx I don't agree w his politics, but that's fine
Neat, Patrick Brown won. Former coworkers play hockey w him. He always seemed like a solid guy whenever I met him at various charity events.
One of these days, I will remember to bring my yoga mat from home
@the_Zubes I don't use the word hero often, but
@the_Zubes was the container of ice cream full when you started eating it or just finishing it off?
@heyemilydawn you look great! That dress is so cute
@MsBooWho to be fair, it did say it hasn't been. I know what you mean though -- I'm the same
@DesaiDevang 
@justsherryj this wknd is Toronto comic arts festival at the reference library. Free to get in
I'm not sure how it got into my head, but I have been singing "Save Tonight" for the past 15min
@NigelCadbury he doesn't chase. He sits close to you, looking extra cute
@AlsoNamedPhil @draglikepull I love that book &amp; movie though
@NigelCadbury that sounds like when I actually eat ice cream sandwiches when my dog is around
@AlsoNamedPhil @draglikepull according to my mom, my 1st movie in theatre was Secret of Nimh, but I don't remember it. I would have been 2
@AlsoNamedPhil @draglikepull yup. I remember the theatre marquee, sitting in the balcony &amp; being scared of Jabba.
@draglikepull I have other Star Wars memorize from around that time, but pinpointing exact age is tricky
@draglikepull I have 2 from 3yrs old -- playing w my best friend &amp; he kept eating my snack &amp; Return of the Jedi in theatre.
@MsBooWho "you're actually quite listenable" 
@claudvandamn I think I'll make that my new bio
@claudvandamn I wouldn't fuck him with my worst enemy's vagina
If I don't go to the gym now, I won't get a chance later today. Always have to keep that Red Sonja cosplay in mind
@langluy good morning :)
@claudvandamn ew
@the_Zubes 
My dog is running so hard in his sleep that he is shaking the entire bed
@JGoldsbie and everyone else knows what happens when you kill his dog
@VTcaps 2 towels <OK HAND SIGN>
@JGoldsbie but he couldn't protect the first puppy!
@JGoldsbie I'm really concerned for the life of the dog he got at the end of the 1st movie
@antogold harmony universal remote - tv, receiver, everything runs through it. I set it down to go to the kitchen
@antogold my brother took my 3rd tv. I kinda wish I still had it so I could set up 2 screens in 1 room
@antogold yeah, I know. I'm prepared to be disappointed
I had been flipping back &amp; forth b/n the games while watching TFC lose on my laptop :(
I was watching Caps/Rangers &amp; missed the Habs loss :(
@GrinWithGuilt if it goes to hulu, I don't think it will be on Netflix
@GrinWithGuilt oh no! I love that show
@DuncanIdunno ++++ <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART> you're awesome
Someone likes ice cream 
@Mariia19 congrats!
@clrkaitken when the drive is only 15min, can't get through them that quickly
I wrote dog puns.
What to name your New York baseball dog: 
I'm very behind on podcasts. I blame not wanting to take ttc in the winter &amp; driving everywhere instead 
@mforbes37 @ryantologist @schocker17 that is weird, but it could prob be blamed on wedding drunk
@wraparoundcurl screenshots last forever
@Jeffler I also need someone to do this
@mforbes37 @ryantologist @schocker17 what kind of randoms are trying to hug you?
LRT not sure who else is watching iZombie, but he is my fav part of the show
@mforbes37 @ryantologist @schocker17  but you hug ppl you know. It's hard, but I've really been trying. I sometimes even offer hugs!
@ryantologist @schocker17 my family at least awkwardly hugs now
@ryantologist @schocker17 I grew up in a family that didn't hug. It was very hard b/c I'm not used to being touched platonically
@schocker17 a small sacrifice to make others feel good.
@schocker17 i don't consider myself one either, but I have put in effort to be better at hugging ppl so it's not awkward.
#501st 
 
@MrButterChicken you'd have to ask someone else. I left it on the hand rail of the elevator.
What kind of spider has thick legs covered in white dots? It was about the size of my middle finger nail.

@leoraisrael 
@leoraisrael puppies are great &amp; happy endings make me optimistic that I will get one too
@leoraisrael I know! And the douchebag jar &lt;3 mess it up, be friends, whatever but, if it's there, it's there.
@GrinWithGuilt eclairs are a good choice
@GrinWithGuilt what was the congrats actually for?
@mattlef2 nah, totally clean
@GrinWithGuilt I'm curious -- if I'm vanilla cake, would you be brown sugar?
Clark: *lowers glasses* "More like Fat- 
Lois: "Oh my god …
@GrinWithGuilt hahahaha
@GrinWithGuilt it's a good thing I like them back
@GrinWithGuilt and I just thought it was b/c of my boobs &amp; curvy ass! Lol
@GrinWithGuilt funny enough, men of colour are usually what I attract
@GrinWithGuilt it's cool. We had been texting earlier about dog stuff, so I was likely last conversation
I didn't mean for that to sound sad. More like an observational "huh"
@Leafer1984 totally innocuous. She dropped him off at the airport
I had forgotten was it was like to read that someone loves you.
"Wrong babe"
Ex accidentally texted me instead of his fiancée. Oops 
@inaneenglish going shy is trying to keep all the things I want to do to him from showing on my face. I'm sure he can still see it haha
@inaneenglish I knew I had a pic in real life -- he was w Chip for the day outside of FanExpo 
@vcarneiro hard to believe, I know. But, it happens!
@inaneenglish 
@inaneenglish I knew you would fav that lol even though you've only seen comic versions of him, you know who I'm talking about, right?
@schocker17 runs the store
If you ever want to see me transform into a shy idiot, go w me to buy comics when the gorgeous guy is there (which is every time I go)
.@AlsoNamedPhil had never been to the Pumps, so easy sell to go for lunch 
@olhnso I'm excited to see Giovinco. They have some momentum &amp; I think they can win against Houston. @DesaiDevang would know better than me
@SuicidePass my dad took me to Dire Straits when I was 10. I was so tired at school the next day
@AlsoNamedPhil I remember being in university &amp; she was telling us about 13yr olds coming in for abortions.
@AlsoNamedPhil I know the age of consent isn't 14 anymore. A friend's mom is nurse &amp; would have some stories from the hospital
@AlsoNamedPhil when I read that yday, waiting to teach pregnancy prevention until grade 8 bothered me in that I think it should be younger
@olhnso box seats are sweet. Got to visit the mock suites for sales they have set up near gate 1 few wks ago <OK HAND SIGN> I'll be there Sunday
@TSNBobMcKenzie my parents were at that same concert! They had just gotten married mth before &amp; moved back to Ontario
@olhnso I went to about half the matches last season &amp; it's fun, even when it's terrible. They've won their last 2 -- winning streak lol
@olhnso are people at least using the Mother's Day excuse?
Unless she has beer coming out of her tits instead of milk, no girl is irreplaceable

@blackdogpat that is good time!
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 good :) it's great when dogs have their own space. I think my parents still have my extra crate if you want it
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 are you planning to crate train?
@SkinnyPPPhish @mforbes37 I'm also sad to be missing out on the fashion critiques
@phylliskessel13 mony mony? Of course. Who doesn't?
@the_Zubes they had other songs?
@Kenjamin12 @DesaiDevang I'm aware. I live east side
@DesaiDevang there's a reason Thorncliffe Park had the greatest % of students absent 
@the_Zubes I've had fluid drained from my knee before -- it looked like Mountain Dew
@DesaiDevang what about this? 
@DesaiDevang 
@the_Zubes fuck the rules. If you want that poutine, go for it
@AlsoNamedPhil yeah, meet there &amp; we'll figure it out
@AlsoNamedPhil I'll be at Yonge &amp; college
@AlsoNamedPhil I was jus thinking that. Also, lunch 1130ish tmrw?

@AlsoNamedPhil 
@AlsoNamedPhil btw, are you around for lunch tmrw?
@AlsoNamedPhil 

Noel Gallagher describing Man City vs United like "Jedi triumph over the evil Empire" on Star Wars day
@dlbno anyone bite?
@Peter_Lynn It's always fun to see the direction everyone takes when they're Harley. She's a blast to cosplay
@inaneenglish I like her costume too. Colours in the hair get me, but I've been Harley as a brunette, so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@scifeyecandy the lightsabers glow in the material I have 
@GrinWithGuilt spay or neuter your pets
The cotton candy hair bothers me a little, but I like the rest of her look 
I wonder who is teaching that... 

He's now going to supervise me as I work at my desk. Needs a white hard hat 
Poor Hemi :( he looked scared &amp; needed cuddles
I heard my dog barking/howling, so I ran to the other room to check on him &amp; he woke up. Must have been having quite the nightmare
@SeanFitz_Gerald get more food?
@DesaiDevang it sounds like they want everyone to look like they belong in old B-movie sci fi
@SeanFitz_Gerald it's not lunch -- it's 2nd breakfast
#MayThe4thBeWithYou 
May the 4th be with you 

(From last yr's FanExpo &amp; Starkiller is not on twitter) 
@dannyd1976 I'm really enjoying it
I like how the snowtroopers really blend in the background 
Motion capture? Lupita Nyong’o is so gorgeous that I'm really curious what her character's face will be.. 
@MsBooWho May the 4th be with you, Boo
@MsBooWho I'm seeing a lot of negative comments in my timeline
So nice that I had the same dream twice
@schocker17 @BradMac91 I'm usually in flats &amp; would like to hear more
@BradMac91 @schocker17 they better *fist shaking*
@BradMac91 @schocker17 tall is attractive. Most of my heels add about 4" to my height
@BradMac91 @schocker17 and Tiger is 6'1"
@BradMac91 @schocker17 I want to say tall is 6'
@BradMac91 @schocker17 well, I forget how many there were when he was cheating on Elin
@schocker17 @BradMac91 the man is going to be neck deep in pussy
@BradMac91 real talk is 24/7
Let's face it, when you're with someone &amp; you're attracted to each other, that's where the end of the night is going
(I say most people b/c there are selfish asses that don't reciprocate)
Jokingly called my dog a junk licker, but immediately realized that it's not an insult since most people it to other people.
@justsherryj 
@phylliskessel13 I pvr'd it since I still have to watch last wk's ep. I'm so curious now!
Cute guy smoking outside the lobby hallway window caught me checking him out. When I looked back, he was watching me walk away. So it begins
@itsgettinglate so the duck lips in the sonogram was just practicing for photos?
@itsgettinglate congrats!!!!!!
@claudvandamn I should note that my family likes to find cards that make fun of ourselves or are just insulting
@claudvandamn so many cards suck &amp; are too sappy that the ones from pets are the only ones that are funny anymore
FIND OUT WHY SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE CASTLE BLACK'S HUNKIEST RESIDENT

PLUS: HOW MUCH DOES STANNIS KNOW?
@draglikepull the windows are open &amp; I'm getting close to taking ice packs out of the freezer &amp; placing them on my skin
@AlsoNamedPhil @antogold my heart hurts in a good way all over again
I refuse to turn on the air conditioner. It's only the start of May!
@NL66_ I can do anything. Lamb can be tricky though
@inaneenglish such assholes. Those are just the things that make someone capable of working smh
@sandwich_dad it's fun
@inaneenglish what the fuck?!
@NL66_ is it that you need someone or that you want someone?
@draglikepull I know! I'm such an evil bitch. Next thing you know I'm going to want to go hockey games or baseball, &amp; soccer
@JoeYerdon can't be too easy. Would miss out on the fun of effort &amp; pursuit.
Having fun w me, making me laugh &amp; keeping me from getting too stressed out shouldn't be too much to ask, right?
I think I need to find a guy who is clueless w BBQ. Or willing to share responsibility. Or let me just do everything.
Grilled salmon for the 20 of us &amp;, after we left, the guys ate all the leftover w their steaks after golfing all day
So I emailed maid of honour asking if there was a BBQ. She said yes, as long as I knew how to use it. "Trust me, babe. I got this."
For a friend's bachelorette party a few yrs ago, there was a potluck before going out. I knew everyone else would bring salads &amp; dessert,
I miss having a BBQ. It's my favourite way to cook everything. Even had a flat surface to make bacon &amp; eggs on the grill
htt…
@itsgettinglate something I have yet to experience, but I'm told no one is. Enjoy the ride
@itsgettinglate are you ready?
@itsgettinglate gorgeous day for your baby to be on the way
@itsgettinglate dude
@AlsoNamedPhil so many things I love about this pic that I don't even know where to start. Adorable, the jersey, the giant cat <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@DesaiDevang 
@ASports89 great call <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Girls taking selfies on the sidewalk. I'm not sure how long they have been posing
Glad I didn't have to pay for that. Didn't even have to buy a drink
So meh
@dlbno pour vous <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
@dlbno @itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang I know. Headbanging in a Whitecaps is prob a worse assault on the eyes
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang @dlbno well, the snap I got was not a butt snap <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@dlbno @DesaiDevang nbd 
@DesaiDevang 
@thescottlewis @olhnso sun life near St. Andrews station - bathrooms are behind the stairs leading to main floor
@ErikBlevins @heyemilydawn I have no doubt. It's been so long since I've made sauces &amp; desserts that maple flavour wasn't even an option
I can't wait for next Sunday
@ErikBlevins @heyemilydawn smoked maple? I've seen maple whiskey, but smokey would really add to that
@heyemilydawn @ErikBlevins that works. It looks delicious
@ErikBlevins @heyemilydawn Is it Crown Royal pecan pie?
@MsBooWho I usually take things to a spot in London that I've used for years
@MsBooWho I usually sell them. I've been meaning to go through them, see what I can kijiji or take to consignment shop
@MsBooWho I've always had one purse I use very day. I used to change it up to go out, had diff colours, clutches. Can't be bothered anymore
@MsBooWho keep an eye out if she starts copying other things about you so she doesn't try to single white female you
@MsBooWho I still have a large moving box of purses that I haven't even unpacked. I just keep using the same 3 based on what I'm doing
@MsBooWho that's a good thing to fit into a Vancouver purse
@claudvandamn he made sure to lick it all off his nose haha
Cupcake icing just gets everywhere 
@antogold reading this makes me think that small swim shorts are acceptable at some point
I never thought I'd say this, but I think the cute guy behind me in yoga is too young for me
To the gym! B/c there is no acceptable female equivalent to the dad bod
I just had the best sleep that I've had in ages
@dannyd1976 @NigelCadbury @schocker17 I'm now a little concerned why I have drunk Dan knowledge
@dannyd1976 @NigelCadbury @schocker17 do I win a prize for being correct?
Always mustard &amp; pickles. Never onions. Ketchup can go to hell. Or on the side for dipping fries
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 I thought that was 2 of them &amp; then peeing on a tree?
Bacon McDouble

@squiggg the eyebrows problem
@justsherryj for sure! I was really trying to write legibly, so I'm glad you could read it! Penmanship is...not my strength
@blackdogpat lovely! And it looks like the necklace matches your tie
@Peter_Lynn I never assume you have good intentions
@MsBooWho tbh, I'm not really sure
@MsBooWho your dog licks his own butt
@MsBooWho babies have been blowing kisses at me the past cpl days. I just melt
@Peter_Lynn the purolator guys always seemed to time deliveries for when I was just getting out of the shower &amp; in a robe #robetwitter
@Peter_Lynn I would just stand at the front door at my old house. There were a lot of kids on the cul-de-sac
@PaddyGurks On the cd single, there is an acoustic version of Personal Jesus that I just adore &amp; prefer to album version
@PaddyGurks solid. I have no idea what I would choose if I had to rank their songs.
@AlsoNamedPhil very convenient. I don't remember logging off the entire time I was writing. Have fun!
@AlsoNamedPhil are you at the lab today?
@Peter_Lynn were you yelling at kids to get off your lawn?
@PaddyGurks couldn't resist sending your list to my brother, who is basically a Depeche Mode super fan 
@AlsoNamedPhil just saw it! Thank you :)
@AlsoNamedPhil thanks, I'll give it a read. I know some of the journals are free, but it always seems like what I want to read costs $$$
@AlsoNamedPhil interesting... Since I no longer have access to pubmed, I haven't kept up w recent research
There is a heritable element to the disease, but that may be more about susceptibility to an environmental trigger?
Before bacteria was found to be cause of ulcers, stress/diet was assumed. Wonder if this could be similar? 
@draglikepull As far as I can tell, he's a stay-at-home dad &amp; his daughter is adorable.
@draglikepull About the right age that is likely when he got them. They look exactly like what I wore when I ran track in hs
Given that I'm in yoga pants, I'm not one to judge
The guy I always see walking around my building in a robe is outside! Wearing pants! Tearaways, but still
@the_Zubes tempting, but I don't feel like getting dressed &amp; going anywhere
I was thinking about taking myself out for a late dinner, but staying home w popcorn &amp; garlic butter is starting to seem like a good idea
Someone on my floor burned popcorn so badly that it hits you the moment you walk off the elevator
@SkinnyPPPhish @claudvandamn Ftr, I don't track those ratios
@SkinnyPPPhish @claudvandamn I know you mean 'paint by numbers,' but game of numbers makes me think approaches, contacts, appointments lol
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @MsBooWho I'm get this -- I'm INTJ
@claudvandamn @SkinnyPPPhish I've been told I don't date properly too. Fuck the "rules." Just do what you want.
@AlsoNamedPhil @blackdogpat @mforbes37 warmth in the cold &gt; aesthetic appeal
@mrsharpphoto it would really be great for it
@mrsharpphoto do them every day, several times. Plus, other stuff
The only guys I know that are cut practically live at the gym &amp; need to have abs for work
My timeline jumped ahead from where I left it -- why are ppl focused on dad bod? That basically describes most dudes
@MsBooWho *high five*
@MsBooWho it's absolutely terrible. I don't ever want to be a teenager again
@MsBooWho true. I recognized the problem pretty quickly, but it didn't make it suck less
@MsBooWho and you turned out amazing :)
@MsBooWho you're right, I'm more than ok :) though I do forget when I'm out by myself that I could have asked ppl to join me haha
@MsBooWho they weren't much help when I was dealing w being ostracized at school on &amp; off for yrs.
@MsBooWho yeah, I don't exactly have the most emotionally intelligent family.
@MsBooWho I love being alone when I go out. It was sad at 1st when I was 13, but you get over it very quickly.
@chrisjlund I dig it
@MsBooWho @NigelCadbury you're the alpha -- go investigate
@MsBooWho @NigelCadbury he won't go over to it?
@MsBooWho @NigelCadbury he likely hears something. When I had the house, my dog would react when he could hear the neighbour's tenants
@NigelCadbury @MsBooWho it sucks when pets get old :(
@MsBooWho I would guess it's something you can't hear? Is your cat acting like something is there too?
@MsBooWho I think he would have an accident in the house if it was a seizure
@MsBooWho neighbours on a balcony &amp; the sound carries? Bird's nest on the side of the building? There's prob something out there
@MsBooWho maybe your dog is hearing a neighbour or something?
@MsBooWho my dog will wake up from a dream &amp; go after something as if it is there. But, he quickly realizes nothing is there
@justsherryj I would read this
Cat on a leash in the lobby is curious about my dog 
@GrinWithGuilt and yes, the costumes haha I love it
@GrinWithGuilt I did 10yrs w guy like me &amp; was a struggle for control.My plan is to find a creative &amp; expressive guy who will have fun w me
@GrinWithGuilt I'm a serious, responsible adult too. I actually like taking care of the practical daily tasks in life. I get things done.
@GrinWithGuilt I always have fun, so not worried about that :)
@GrinWithGuilt breakfast for dinner is one of my fav things
@dlbno @itsgettinglate you prefer to burn the extra calorie as your cold drink warms to body temperature?
@itsgettinglate had to think about this, but I turn on the hot water tap to brush my teeth, so warm water too. Going with not weird
@searexx she's the best

@robdonia np :)
@robdonia I already left that clown in my rearview &amp; am happily not on the road
@robdonia I'd really rather not
@vcarneiro I've been singing a few of their songs on &amp; off all day
@robdonia I doubt it
@vcarneiro brother is a huge, huge fan. I've been listening since Violator was released
...then the "Keep Calm &amp; Chive On" decal on the back of your car just seals it
Yes, guy w 1 hand out the driver window on the roof &amp; the other out the sunroof, if I wasn't super impressed that you can steer w your knees
@MsBooWho !!!!!!!
I should've put my clubs in the trunk of my car 
This morning, Depeche Mode was playing. Enjoy the Silence...is not what happened
Of course, there was singing &amp; dancing in my car. If I'm being honest, when is there not?
Latch randomly came on during my drive. It's been months since I heard it. Forgot how much I like it 
I had no idea that Ferrari had a bicycle rack. You learn something new every day
@MsBooWho I get weirdly excited about a lot of things
Clean handoff in the relay 
I'm going to miss filing as a business w a June deadline instead of April
I love my accountant. Saved me over $2000 in taxes owing, even w rrsp purchases. 4 income sources, 2 from self-employed makes it complicated
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @NigelCadbury @schocker17 omg boo, don't do that again
@MrButterChicken @mlse I'd like to think that the other stds would get treated by a doctor &amp; not kill them
@mlse @MrButterChicken they're not going to die -- they're going to create more ppl who won't receive sex ed
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @NigelCadbury @schocker17 gotta watch out for the charming ones
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @NigelCadbury @schocker17 good! I try to be on my phone in cabs or anything that gives me a creepy vibe
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @NigelCadbury @schocker17 were you actually texting someone at the time?
@itsgettinglate Good call. I have started remembering to wear shirts under my hoodie
@ryantologist @NigelCadbury @MsBooWho I've always met in public places too. And my dog is usually in the car
Dark circles from exam season, allergy season, lack of sleep, whatever
A woman thought I was still in undergrad this morning. At 1st, thought it was a compliment, but now I'm starting to wonder how tired I look
@Leafer1984 it's my fav look to get when I'm backing into a parking space &amp; the doors next to me swing open &amp; ppl fall out like a clown car
@Leafer1984 just so stunned that you dared to even address them. It's their world &amp; you're just living in it
@Leafer1984 was the response just a wide-eyed expression?
@mforbes37 @dannyd1976 this is why a phone needs to be grafted to your hand
@Leafer1984 I assume they want the door broken off their car. Or just too far into their own little world to pay attn to their surroundings
@phylliskessel13 you missed the fun stage of housebreaking a puppy
"Guh?"
"Take care."
"Buh." 
@SkinnyPPPhish just having fun w emojis :P
@DALee74 does no one know a fake orgasm when they see one?

@DuncanIdunno I can't wait for future me to laugh at this. (Just finished ep where Sadie shot her ex)
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @mforbes37 drinks in May/June should be another manhattan night
@MsBooWho @schocker17 damn autocorrect
I would miss no longer owning all of the Godfather movies on DVD, but 1 of them is always on when I search the guide
@Leafer1984 sweet. Now that the jays game is finally over...
@schocker17 @MsBooWho 
@Leafer1984 I was just thinking it has been waaayyy too long since I watched the Godfather
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 I'm guessing from watching Magic &amp; Bird on hbo?

@MsBooWho that is sad. all places should have wine
@MsBooWho is there a reason you are not having more wine? did you run out of wine?
@MsBooWho I have not had wine. I hope you are having wine
@itsgettinglate @dlbno @DesaiDevang same
@the_Zubes very nice <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@dannyd1976 so sorry to hear :( *hug* losing a pet is so difficult, even when you know it's coming
@DuncanIdunno I was at atomic lollipop last yr. This will not dissuade me from going again
@MsBooWho well, those diseases would make you sterile, so problem solved!
@MsBooWho Awareness! Research! it would raise more money than all current charities combined.
@MsBooWho it sounds more like they don't have to make an effort to satisfy their partner. Just don't use a condom &amp; she'll be happy!!1
@MsBooWho I know. I was just being snarky. Mouthwash idea is a good one though haha
@MsBooWho just settle for orgasmic joy. If it happens
@vcarneiro yeah, I was thinking I would go to the friendly too
@MsBooWho And who doesn't feel better getting laid regularly?
@MsBooWho it doesn't look like the study included swallowing  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@Briligerent 
@DuncanIdunno salt the earth
@ryantologist @MsBooWho if it's only 8 mths. In the 5yrs I lived there, I was convinced Barrie was Huron word for snow/rain 11mths of the yr
@searexx happy birthday!
@MsBooWho I've met him. Yes, he is
@DuncanIdunno if you get started tonight, you have 9 mths to catch up

@Peter_Lynn @jrlind my dog had a luxating patella too. Surgery when he was just over a yr old. I was lucky his cruciate ligament was intact
@Hope_Smoke great to hear &amp; best wishes for your recovery :) I think I saw a while ago -- Crohn's disease, right?
@antogold they're trying to draw you in to watch over their shoulder
@wraparoundcurl there are ppl that want  to follow intense rage all the time? I'm here for the makeup, comics, hockey &amp; boy band love
@PaddyGurks Until the End of the World is my fav of theirs
@jennyquarx glad to hear things are good :)
@jennyquarx how are you doing? I miss a lot of tweets being on/off
@jennyquarx I've also been looking at fireproof safe for important documents. Think that's what I'll ask for Xmas from my parents
@jennyquarx I have Dropbox too
Yes, I am that paranoid that I would want more than one copy. Hard drives fail.
I think I should get a 2nd 3TB hard drive to make another back up of 1 of my laptops so I can blank it of everything but music
@theninjagreg @dannyd1976 should still research the breed. Have an idea of what traits you want in a dog &amp; see what fits
This is taking forever
I'm not sure why my phone wouldn't back up to iTunes, but at least I'm finally getting pics off of it
@MsBooWho the foreman/manager/engineer is the one in charge &amp; wears a white hard hat. They would be the person in charge of safety
@DesaiDevang 
@antogold *sigh* Toronto sports
@claudvandamn I used 3rd party to find corrupted files in the hopes that they were the problem, but deleting them did not open dcim folder
@claudvandamn I usually back up pics to this laptop, then do itunes back up to the other (I use cloud for everything but pics)
@the_Zubes haha I know
@the_zubes clearing pics on my phone &amp; found this. No clue why I didn't just fav it. Can't wait for summer! 
@claudvandamn not really lol
I keep pressing the button for my iPhone to trust my laptop that doesn't have iTunes on it, but it won't :( clearly has issues

"Do I have to stand here?" 
Stubborn dog refusing to pose for photos 
Vegan ice cream for @antogold :) great reward for the CN tower stairclimb 
Go Marlies! 
@schocker17 @antogold most charities allow for online donations about a wk after the event
@schocker17 @antogold looks like you can still donate 
The worst autocorrects are the ones where they change the actual word you wanted to use &amp; typed correctly into something else
@antogold *gave
@antogold treated tap water <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> at least they have you something to rehydrate at the end. Proud of you!
The new Joker looks like he's part of the gang from Batman Beyond, not the Clown Prince of Crime
@itsgettinglate I think I've only been to Wonderland twice as an adult
@itsgettinglate I'll take your word for it. Parents only took us to Wonderland once. I think I was 6. Then went on 2 school trips gr9 &amp;10.
@mererog did you ever see any of the Stella McCartney for Adidas?
@itsgettinglate looks like fun :) I love seeing old pics. Never went as a kid &amp; I've only been to the amphitheatre for concerts.
@mlse so just the one corner doesn't count?
@GrinWithGuilt I'm afraid I would not be the 99% genius I once was
@GrinWithGuilt I'm tempted to look at my 1st yr calculus textbook to see how much I still understand. Def not as much as I did at the time
@NigelCadbury @SkinnyPPPhish @mlse actually, packages at my seat when I got there
@mlse what's the difference? Entire section had them
@mlse there were streamers at 1 of the matches I was at last yr in Sept
@NigelCadbury @schocker17 awww that's too bad. No wonder he stomps his feet to get you up
@schocker17 @NigelCadbury yeah, but yours claws your back. Mine wants to cuddle now that I'm home
@sandwich_dad I'm impressed you can braid your hair. Not that it's long enough to do it, but that you have the skill
My dog looks annoyed that I'm not following him while he puts himself to bed

@arthur_affect @AndrayDomise The Returned had an interesting take on a zombie cure that was running out 
@inaneenglish *hug* hope you'll be ok. Feel better
@phylliskessel13 yours is adorable too! So photogenic
@itsgettinglate @mererog @DrewGROF they were called snap pants when I ran track in high school. I actually still have mine
@phylliskessel13 I know that feel 
@mlse @formerlyfrozen dude, you were invited for goodbye drinks
@the_Zubes great read :)
@bebek1ng @Danwinnik34 cool if my dog joins the pack? 
LRT I love that necklace
@justsherryj my parents were visiting &amp; my dad took my winters rather than my having to pay to store them
@antogold @ryantologist but I eat small throughout the day rather than large meals
@antogold @ryantologist I find that has more to do w number of hrs before going to bed than a specific window of time
Spilled olive oil on my stove top &amp; remembering the time 1 of my roommates from university nearly started a fire
@justsherryj mine came off Sat. It's around 4C that there's a difference. Softer rubber of snow tires so much better below 0 to grip ice
@ryantologist nice...I'm going to go w breakfast for dinner. Eggs &amp; toast
@antogold I assume after sitting for the game &amp; your muscles lock that I will have to fireman carry you to the streetcar
It occurs to me that I took a nap instead of eating dinner earlier. Must fix this
@GrinWithGuilt good to know the superhero vibe is out there haha thank you
@GrinWithGuilt it's yours
@antogold <FACE THROWING A KISS> I'm glad I saw the link! I'll carry you to Marlies later if you can't walk
@GrinWithGuilt do you want the extra shirt I picked up from last night's Raptors game? Seat next to me was empty, so no one wore it
@bebek1ng well, let me know if you feel like going out. I'm free to hang anywhere tonight
@DesaiDevang this is a good list. I would eat all of them <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang Oreos are my brother's fav &amp; I hate them so much. Peak Freans fruit creme &amp; shortbread forever
@bebek1ng where are you thinking?
@MsBooWho 
@AlsoNamedPhil @dannyd1976 @MsBooWho those are some cutthroat kids
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho or learn to sneak into your house quietly
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho good plan. I had creme de menthe on ice cream since I was a kid. Just have to teach responsibility
"Mountain Dew or Crab Juice." 
Fyi, it is hard to laugh when your core is being held together by retention sutures
I actually have a pic from when my wound was left open &amp; packed w saline-soaked gauze. I won't tweet that though
I really need to organize my pics folder
Always proud to show my scars in @scifeyecandy bikinis or latex &amp; Lycra costumes of superheroes :) 
LRT never be ashamed of your scars
@NigelCadbury safe travels
@MsBooWho <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MsBooWho I need to be in a better mood later. I'm hoping food &amp; a nap helps
@Peter_Lynn I don't need a blog post complaining about it to know not to go there
@MrButterChicken @mlse I grew up there, so yes
@itsgettinglate if I didn't have to work, I would just keep listing items
@itsgettinglate McGangbang #mysexlifeinamcdonaldsvaluemenuitem
@itsgettinglate Bacon McDouble #mysexlifeinamcdonaldsvaluemenuitem

pun full…
@AlsoNamedPhil loved hiking at Onaping Falls &amp; skiing
@AlsoNamedPhil outdoors is fantastic. It would be the only thing that would make me consider it
"If you want the ultimate, you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price"
LRTs good thing my car is standard. No way my dog could clutch &amp; shift

"THIS ACT IS OVER." 
A lot of things I don't miss about Sudbury &amp; more than just being miserable for few yrs of high school :P I have no interest in moving back
1 of my brothers &amp; I used to hit the beach daily to play frisbee. Always outside doing something
LRT I miss the lakes. 3 beaches a quick drive from my parents' house

Had a dream that my dog was put down. What an absolute nightmare. I'm still shaking
Some guy walking past told me I have lovely hair. Things are looking up
I'm normally good luck at games :(

@jomsie I would also remove the stickers from it
@GrinWithGuilt he was at 1 of the games I went to this season in Dec if you go back in my pics. All are of him.
So tempted just so I could bend the brim 
Watched that dude get his face done. Hardcore. Would've tagged him, but he wandered off before I could ask
#RTZ #WeTheNorth 
@dlbno only butt snaps?

@MrButterChicken I don't know if I can look at your tweets in the same way ever again
@DesaiDevang 
My favourite bartender is working! I was so disengaged from hockey that I wasn't out as much. Great to catch up :) I missed her
@MsBooWho don't even know what inspired this comment, but yes
@justsherryj will send this wk :) and I had no trouble reading your handwriting haha
@justsherryj speaking of assholes,I got your letter for national letter writing mth last wk &amp; time completely got away from me to write back
@justsherryj what an asshole
@AndrayDomise I see your point about Nightcrawler though. He had a lot of issues
@AndrayDomise it's been a long time since I read Marvel, but Iceman was kind of a jerk that it makes sense
Dog: Just Google it and stop wasting my fucking time.
@robdonia I had been out &amp; needed the 4hrs of sleep that I got before I had to be up Sat morning
@robdonia yeah. I watched on Saturday
@robdonia yeah, same, on sportsnet. I checked my pvr
@JoeYerdon slow cookers are great. I haven't used mine in a while
@blurr1974 @schocker17 I usually just use butter, salt &amp; pepper
@JoeYerdon how are you cooking things?
@schocker17 @blurr1974 that would be really good. I'll use seasoned salt sometimes
@JoeYerdon stove top, use some oil. Takes about 10min
@JoeYerdon you can use kernels in the microwave -- 1/4 cup in a paper bag, twist shut. Set for 3min, but usually done around 2min
@JoeYerdon I highly recommend it
Melted garlic butter on popcorn is so, so good
@DuncanIdunno not all of us. I have a Jets hoodie that I picked up a few yrs ago when I was out there for work
@phylliskessel13 those eyes. Mine likes to put himself to bed too
@leoraisrael oh wow, I remember a live action movie, a cartoon &amp; had 2 of the toys
My dog just keeps following me as I go b/n tvs
@AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 they took over the boathouse!
@AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 we always had to jump way off the dock at aunt &amp; uncle's former cottage. Don't climb back up, just walk to shore
@DuncanIdunno I liked last night's episode
@robdonia I assume it's the same ep that I pvr'd on tsn this past wknd?
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil deal
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil I will hook you up Boo. It just can't be today
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil I know, I know
@NigelCadbury @MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil I know they do -- cookies, cupcakes -- usually a sub for butter or oil
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil I think these also need to be made
I never thought I would need to make egg substitute from flax, but here we are
@CarcelMousineau thanks. It's not for tonight, so no rush. I have a few tabs open comparing them
@sandwich_dad did you ever get the key lime cookie recipe?
@CarcelMousineau that would be perfect :) please pass along
@AlsoNamedPhil not at all, but not all baked goods are about me.
Note: I am not vegan, but the brownies have to be
*looks up vegan brownie recipes*

I haven't had a chance to hit a range yet this season. This wknd is looking good
Soon 
@chrisjlund I had to make notes, so never needed things fully transcribed. Having audio attach to file was excellent 
@chrisjlund have you ever tried transcription programs or something like livescribe? I used to have to attach notes &amp; audio to client files
@jasegiles that doesn't seem fair to AM. There are *2* 4:35s in a day &amp; one shouldn't be treated more special than the other
@Heisenbergkamp 1 of my favs too. My Sunday night was Parker Lewis, In Living Color, Married...w Children &amp; Herman's Head
@jasegiles where were you to celebrate this 12 hrs ago?
@TaoofStieb and the surprise has to be something that you know she wants, but considers impractical
@TaoofStieb get her what she wants &amp; surprise her w something else
@squiggg <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@AlsoNamedPhil <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@schocker17 @AlsoNamedPhil yeah, I was reading someone's rant about that earlier today.
@AlsoNamedPhil to receive DMs from randoms? No clue. Mine are only about making lunch plans anyway. Btw, lunch in May?
@AlsoNamedPhil no, just a joke. You can opt out of receiving DMs from everyone 
@AlsoNamedPhil no one ever DMs me, no worries Phil lol
@schocker17 I run into him &amp; his adorable 1yr old daughter every day, never the same time
@schocker17 there is a guy in my building that I only ever see wearing pj pants, wife beater &amp; a robe
*checks DMs* 
@justsherryj @chrisjlund awesome! There was a Lego version for the 1st trailer too 
@inaneenglish uh oh...be safe

FRANK, MAN, YOU’RE ALIVE

I JUST…

I SAW THIS HANDBAG MAN

IT LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU.

OH FRANK I’M SO RELIEVED. ht…
@MsBooWho yes, I did

Lucifer: "got you fam"

#420 
@Leafer1984 @MsBooWho I had a blanket. It is safely packed away
I gotta eat. I gotta hunt. I gotta <FISTED HAND SIGN> 
@bookofloob @antogold that's so great
@Leafer1984 yeah, it's a long story. I tweeted a bit about it last yr on the anniversary
@JoeYerdon thank you :) me too. And my dog is awesome
It really explains a lot about me -- who I am &amp; what I consider important
I should've died when I was 20. There were a lot of things in my favour that kept the odds 50/50 I would be alive.
Nothing beats the comfort our pets bring into our lives. If my dog didn't have his health issues, he would be a therapy dog
Didn't seem to understand &amp; thought my dad was nuts. Then my mom wheeled me into the lobby, IVs &amp; other tubing everywhere. It meant so much
LRT my parents brought my cat to see me in the night entrance lobby a few days after my 1st surgery. Security at the door to the hospital
@wraparoundcurl starts with a C. Close enough
@MsBooWho I'm curious why she bought pasta sauce if she doesn't eat pasta
@DuncanIdunno 69 in cat years?
@SuicidePass female friend with benefits?
@wraparoundcurl @inaneenglish hmmm..how do you feel about looking like you ate a bloody heart?
@wraparoundcurl nice! Specific outfit of hers in mind? (I've seen pics of a nude body suit w stuffed dragons in strategic places)
@mererog movie was not good, but loved the soundtrack
@DesaiDevang as a fan of no beard, a little blood is a worthy sacrifice
@mforbes37 I hope you backed up recently. I'm guessing nothing happens plugged into iTunes?
@itsgettinglate ex &amp; I had own tablets &amp; separate everything, so I'm going to say you should share
@mforbes37 it's not resetting? Mine will reboot on its own every once in a while
@itsgettinglate 
@itsgettinglate I'm a fan of blackout lining for curtains
@DuncanIdunno @olhnso congrats on having a boy
@bookofloob @DesaiDevang I was in high school in 1995. It doesn't seem that long ago until I actually think about the year
@bookofloob @DesaiDevang really? Why?
@DesaiDevang it doesn't seem like it was that long ago
Very focused on the plate on my lap. Watching &amp; waiting 
My dinner tonight is just a big plate of leftover brisket &amp; pulled pork. So good
@Peter_Lynn whenever she told the story, she did say he had to help maneuver her hips through the milk door. No doubt some ass grabbing haha
"Anything sweetheart."
"Blow up the hospital." 
No wonder I have developed a preference for younger guys haha
My grandfather. He was 9 yrs younger than her, which did not deter a spitfire of a woman such as her. Yup, she was a cougar
Was on leave from the army &amp; was going to be home to visit, so a group was going out on the town. And that's the night my grandmother met
A munitions factory in WWII. 1 night, a friend/coworker, who lived w her family on Rushton Road, invited my gram out b/c her brother
My gram married at 18, but divorced her 1st husband. Single mom to my half-uncle, she worked various jobs until getting a position at
My gram was awesome &amp; I miss her
So, the milkman helped her wiggle her way back into the house &amp; she never got in trouble. That house is the 1 at Queen &amp; Pape
Then, the milkman arrived &amp; saw her there. My gram wasn't even 5' tall &amp; was tiny. He suggested she could prob fit in the milk door.
The front door 1 night so she couldn't sneak back into the house. My gram sat on the front porch, waiting for morning to get in trouble
When she was 16, my grandmother used to climb out the window of the 2nd floor of the house &amp; go out partying. Her mom wised up &amp; locked
Just realized that 1 of my fav stories from my maternal grandmother (1913-1997) happened a few blocks from where I'm currently sitting
Yeah, I'll be back to the Pumps to try every sandwich
@mforbes37 she was great for the half of the game I saw :)
@MsBooWho that's the plan <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MsBooWho I will
Nothing like flipping off a cab that came speeding up behind you &amp; blocking the space when you're in reverse to parallel park
@MsBooWho if I book it w/out checking dates, you'll bail lol
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I'll go with you. I've never been
@mrsharpphoto @mforbes37 btw, if you're going to visit any memorial sites, go to the Legion here &amp; ask for some poppies to bring overseas
Apparently, it looks like a lot of the houses haven't been maintained since then haha
She was telling me about being 7yrs old &amp; taking the streetcar to the Ex with her grandmother
My mom got to relive some of her childhood memories walking around Leslieville. My great-grandmother lived on Pape, just north of Queen
@mrsharpphoto @mforbes37 good place to visit, but basically a French beach resort. Like Wasaga. Condos all over the place
@mrsharpphoto @mforbes37 they went to the beach, but didn't stay there. Tourist trap, difficult to find parking.
@mrsharpphoto yes, definitely
Look at me getting my @MsBooWho on haha
Now, fake cats made from velvet are thrown from the tower at the conclusion of the parade
The woman told my mom that the throwing of the cats was to bring good fortune &amp; harvest.
It's a parade held every 3 yrs, commemorating a Middle Age tradition in which cats were thrown from the belfry tower to the town square
Chocolate cat from Ieper (Ypres), Belgium to celebrate the Kattenstoet, a festival of the cats 
Souvenirs from my parents' trip to Europe! They've brought me keychains from their travels since I was a kid 
@bebek1ng Tylenol or some other painkiller. My allergies always make my sinuses ache like I was hit in the face w a 2x4
@bebek1ng the worst
Hello to you too ;) 
Just noticed that I've had 1 of my phones on silent all day. Just as well

The dance at the end reminds me of Aaliyah

Giovinco!

@mrsharpphoto well, I was watching TFC, then watched Whitecaps when it was delayed
@justsherryj he'll be ok :)
I've been awake since 5:30am on 3.5hrs of sleep. It's like I'm in university again!
@justsherryj I know as soon as I give up to go to sleep, it will start.
Knee surgery ended such a promising career
My dog working on his keeper skills 
@the_Zubes @DesaiDevang TLC dude
@DesaiDevang if you were a witch, you'd float like a piece of wood or a duck (kidding aside, hope you'll all be ok)
@Green52fan happy belated :)
@justsherryj and pizza loves you
@Zadz74 I stand by that lol
Damnit
Toronto sports can't have nice things
Fucking hell. Just seconds in
Going to the Oilers is like being put out to pasture
Oh fuck off
It's a great shirt, but every time I wear it, I want to cut it into a v-neck. Wmn's sizes would've been nice 
@50_MissionCap happy birthday!
Alarm set for 4hrs from now. Tmrw is going to be a long day.
Not anymore, Vegas. Not anymore 
No more snow in Vegas
@Brohan_Cruyff thank you for bringing this photo into my life
@ErikBlevins @the_Zubes I already did lol
@DuncanIdunno a little outside of the area you're asking, but really good
@DuncanIdunno Local 4 on Dundonald, just north of Wellesley, east of Yonge
I'm really not sure why my phone refuses to correct 'Subday' to 'Sunday'

@DesaiDevang and it's in Braille. Fancy
@MsBooWho interesting..my parents' cat does that with a pair of headbands
@MsBooWho is that a toy?
@justsherryj your subconscious knows what it's doing
@ruhee_ 
@MsBooWho it said 1 of the daughters was 20
LRT yet some random guy made $55000 for potato salad smh
Still not as funny as the time I saw H3 &amp; the plate said BJYS
Saw a woman driving a Mercedes &amp; license plate started BLWY. Yes, I'm sure you did. I'm a terrible person for laughing
@antogold @TVsBrent she is really cool. I met her at canfit a few yrs ago
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil I thought everyone saw the Matrix trilogy?
@MsBooWho @NigelCadbury yeah, she's made that cosplay for someone else 
@MsBooWho now I think it was a cartoon. Oh well
@NigelCadbury @MsBooWho nope. Only so much time &amp; I can't watch everything
@MsBooWho it'll come to me eventually. I should have written it down b/c I had to remind myself of it during comic con too
@NigelCadbury @MsBooWho not anymore
@MsBooWho of course. I want to say it was comic or video game
@MsBooWho a few wks ago, I was thinking about a latex dress &amp; now I can't remember the character :( it will come to me, I hope
@AlsoNamedPhil @SkinnyPPPhish not indefinitely, but a few mths is cool
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil yes, the dvds are 2 rows. That shelf is just DC shows/movies/animated 
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil I would like to see The Killing Joke
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil Joker has better storylines
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil I picked up the Dark Knight returns, but missed a few after Batman Year One
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho always
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil this concerns me. It'll be rushed. But given how slow Man of Steel was, may work out
@AlsoNamedPhil @SkinnyPPPhish you should. I have all the series. Haven't seen some of animated movies that have been released past cpl yrs
@AlsoNamedPhil @SkinnyPPPhish that's a way to keep kryptonite out of it but still use parts of that story
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil it does show Batman in the battle suit...
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil that's a good episode
@AlsoNamedPhil @SkinnyPPPhish what about the diff kinds of kryptonite?
@SkinnyPPPhish @AlsoNamedPhil Batman will have his own mistrust. Doesn't need Luthor for that
@AlsoNamedPhil @SkinnyPPPhish they introduce Wonder Woman, so I would think that's close to the end. Any pics of her look ready for battle
@SkinnyPPPhish I would love to see that
@MsBooWho best to start now before she gets busy for July &amp; August leading up to FanExpo, dragon con, etc
@MsBooWho she has to redo my Donna Troy top since there was a flaw &amp; latex ripped at FanExpo last yr. I can text her
My 1st thought was Frank Miller when pics of Batman were released &amp; after seeing the Batman vs Superman trailer, oh yeah
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 you are worth it
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 only things that are important. Most things don't even register
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 1 of my fav quotes - Lincoln - "Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle."
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I want equal partner as well, so that means I have to go for it too. Can't sit back
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I think it's b/c I'm like that w everything. I want something &amp; I will get it
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I'll make the 1st move when it's someone I want &amp; it feels like that's every time b/c guys just don't step up anymore
@antogold no, but I hope you kept watching to see if you made him uncomfortable
@mc79hockey only an hr wait? You'll be fine. I once had emergency room trip that lasted 9 hrs &amp; it was serious enough for me to be admitted
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 it happens. The thought of Han just takes over all your senses &amp; you lose control
@MsBooWho @AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 "not available on Alderaan" Dying
@DesaiDevang well deserved <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> She was absolutely phenomenal in that role. Perfection
@mforbes37 @DownGoesBrown @ryantologist this reminds me that I need to see if Jimmy is available for this yr
Great to meet Robbie Findley tonight :) 
@draglikepull I've only used my card for go, so figured I should ask
@mrsharpphoto thank you
When I tap on w presto card for streetcar, I don't have to tap off, right?
@mlse he was really great :) and so patient to take a pic w me
A sure sign that the weather is getting nicer
"Mmm mmm mmmm that is a good ass"
@mererog she thought they were neat. I'm really curious if I would love them this much if I 1st saw them as an adult
@mererog my sis-in-law had never seen any of the movies until she started dating my brother. His 2 prev gfs refused to even watch them
@inaneenglish *hug*
@justsherryj the way my heart &amp; other parts of my anatomy reacted lets me know I'm still alive
#StarWars feelings
&lt;3 
@itsgettinglate 1st night in my building, there was 1 on garbage can by the gate to the trail. It hissed at me. My dog did not get a walk
It can be terrible, but I will still love it
1 of my earliest memories is seeing Return of the Jedi in theatre. I'm so fucking excited
@justsherryj we always have nerdy feelings. Just more than usual #StarWars #StarWarsCelebration #C3PO #BB8 #stormtrooper
@GottaBeKD10 new goal is to have more favs than you
@GottaBeKD10 
Wow, just noticed -- over 20k favourites <BALLOON><CONFETTI BALL><PARTY POPPER>
#stormtrooper <PISTOL>
@claudvandamn if I'm going to take my clothes off for free things, it will be for more than coffee
She had the contented look of a lady who's been laid real good
Her owner bred her 3 wks ago. Normally, she runs circles around my dog when she sees him, but she was calm today
Ran into 1 of my dog's gfs &amp; she may be pregnant! Oh noes, Hemi, she's cheating on you! (That's ok, you have other bitches)
Today is going well
Forgot my wallet on 1st walk, so went back. Started to unzip my hoodie when I went in for a coffee, but realized I forgot to put on a shirt
@MsBooWho 
He'll always check the desk looking for him &amp; he'll never be there
There security guard who buys the treats for my dog just told me it's his last day <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> my poor dog! He'll never understand
@MsBooWho you're going to have to have some words w 9yr old me when she 1st started reading mythology
@MsBooWho my favourite :) also Artemis
@MsBooWho I never liked Juno/Hera
@chrisjlund 
@itsgettinglate just a scout doing reconnaissance. Evaluate situation, level of danger &amp; make sure things are all clear. More are coming
@schocker17 I've never noticed that. Hmmm
@schocker17 thinking about it, when I picked him out at 3wks old, he snuggled in &amp; sighed when I held him. That's how I knew he was the one
@schocker17 I was very lonely when I got him &amp; my ex wasn't really into being affectionate
@schocker17 I spent the 1st mth snuggling my dog when he came home instead of writing my thesis. I may have trained cuddling into him
@schocker17 mine is very affectionate. He snuggles up to everyone in the elevator, greets ppl on our walks
@b1rky @draglikepull @schocker17 I don't wear pyjamas
@schocker17 mine is always on the bed. He likes being spooned. Normally, his head is on the pillow next to me
@schocker17 but if ppl saw you shirtless, they may just think you &amp; your wife have been having wild sex!
@ErikBlevins @ryantologist have you seen this? 
I'm really curious how long my dog has been sleeping w his feet ready to kick my face 
My dog is really into the game 
@the_Zubes @GrubersMullet keeping things to schedule is fine. Completely controlling the event is not
@the_Zubes @GrubersMullet she scripted the entire thing except best man's speech b/c he told her there was no way in hell she was writing it
@the_Zubes @GrubersMullet I like this better than the 20 page itinerary for a friend's wedding. The bride basically wrote all the speeches.
@SuicidePass so you're going to write fan fic in the off season, right?
@SuicidePass love the new name
And stopped to say hi to my dog :)
1st shirtless runner of the season! He looked good <FLEXED BICEPS>
@mforbes37 awesome, thanks
@mforbes37 they're leftover from a yr ago when we had a net &amp; kids could shoot for hardest shot w radar gun or on a goalie. Fun times :)
@mforbes37 if you want, let me know. Just don't want them to go to waste. I think there's 20 of them that are new &amp; never used
@mforbes37 
@mforbes37 do you play ball hockey?
@blackdogpat haha good luck :P seriously, you'll be fine. Your kids are great
@NL66_ oh I am. Don't miss that at all
@blackdogpat they'll be teens soon enough. More stories to come :)
@blackdogpat single can provide some good material haha I really like reading about your kids &amp; the things that come up w them
I knew from the start that my ex's step mom hated me. Some ppl can't hide it. I know I've had to for friends' bf/gfs 
@blackdogpat I had to go back &amp; read the pieces you linked. Great stuff
@the_Zubes it seemed like it :) you were great
@DuncanIdunno I'm several eps behind to know if something happened, but it doesn't matter b/c this is true
@the_Zubes new material!! I loved not knowing what was going to happen next in your set haha
Creepy dude told me that I look out of place &amp; asked I needed someone to be with me. Sooooo....not walking to my car alone
@antogold I'll look up if there's a league. Thought I would see if anyone here plays &amp; wants them
@antogold I'll take 1 of my sticks outside &amp; play around myself, but I don't need that many
@antogold yes. Used to give them away to kids at charity events. Would have a radar gun set up for hardest shot.
@Green52fan got your bday card -- thank you! Yours will also be late haha
Anyone play ball hockey &amp; interested in taking some of these off my hands? 
@schocker17 @MsBooWho speciality bakeries usually use human grade ingredients for their dog treats. There was 1 in Cambridge - very tasty
@antogold need rackets. Prob just hit play it again sports or something
@NigelCadbury 1 of my brothers plays regularly. I was eyeing guys playing last summer, so I should sweetly ask 1 of them to help me lol
@itsgettinglate it really is. I believe in you. One day you will hug others w/out causing injuries
Tennis courts in my building are now open! I haven't played in over a decade, but my serve couldn't possibly be any worse, right?
@itsgettinglate you can learn. I'm getting much better at hugging. I sometimes even offer hugs 1st instead of awkwardly receiving. Progress!
@MsBooWho we had satellite dish, so had all the US channels
@MsBooWho I honestly can't remember which one I saw first. Both are fun
@MsBooWho I always enjoyed Death Becomes Her
@AlsoNamedPhil @blackdogpat it was like the person working forgot how to make breakfast sandwiches
@AlsoNamedPhil @blackdogpat when I got there, *I* was the line, ppl at both cash. Ordered &amp; then it went to hell. It was the kitchen
@Leafer1984 maybe mine was overbaked?
@Leafer1984 so I tried both the Nutella doughnut &amp; the pastry pocket. Meh
@NL66_ well, had to make it not a complete waste of my time
Chatted up the cute guy waiting for his bagel though ;)
It doesn't even have a drive-thru, so that's not even an excuse
And orders keep getting mixed up
This is the slowest Tim Hortons I've been to. I've been waiting over 15 min
@itsgettinglate same. It would be gone in a day
@MsBooWho I've been to DC when they're in bloom. So beautiful
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho I know I've fav'd a bunch of them in the past. Will have to go through your vids
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho you've posted a lot of Lucksmiths in the past. I dig it
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @dannyd1976 @schocker17 it's good for just butter &amp; sugar on it too
@schocker17 @GrinWithGuilt I assume she is a succubus
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @schocker17 @dannyd1976 human karaoke machine <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MsBooWho @schocker17 @dannyd1976 I tried to think of some sad lyrics for you, but currently drawing a blank
@ryantologist @schocker17 we've had this convo. Female driving alone. I take the interstate &amp; pay for toll roads
@schocker17 @ryantologist as a female who travels solo, I don't take that risk
@ryantologist @schocker17 I've driven solo to DC, DC to Boston, then home. Many runs to either just DC or Boston
@schocker17 @ryantologist so part of your adventure is a day spent at a garage in the middle of nowhere
@schocker17 @ryantologist you want an unpredictable car?
You're welcome. 
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 @MsBooWho <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> It's a new dawn / It's a new day / It's a new life / For me / And I'm feeling good <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@JoeYerdon need to counter it w a song that has good memories
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho I've noticed that I care less. Things go to hell  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@ryantologist @JLupul is this why you protected your account?
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @ryantologist @mforbes37 @mlse @the_Zubes @formerlyfrozen @DesaiDevang that's when I was thinking
@dannyd1976 @ryantologist @mforbes37 @mlse @the_Zubes @formerlyfrozen @DesaiDevang @schocker17 the manager thought it was me that lit up
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @ryantologist @mforbes37 @mlse @the_Zubes @formerlyfrozen @DesaiDevang Manhattans need to happen
@ryantologist @dannyd1976 @mforbes37 @mlse @the_Zubes @formerlyfrozen @DesaiDevang @schocker17 I think he was just drunk <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
@dannyd1976 @mforbes37 @ryantologist @mlse @the_Zubes @formerlyfrozen @DesaiDevang @schocker17 was just searching my email for this :)
@GrinWithGuilt @schocker17 @theninjagreg we've all seen the gardening videos. There are few places left that are covered
@GrinWithGuilt @theninjagreg @schocker17 psssst...it's actually BBQ that bring the boys to the yard
@theninjagreg @schocker17 @GrinWithGuilt not all of us can have your green thumb. My mother is Pestilence &amp; kills all plant life she touches
@theninjagreg @schocker17 @GrinWithGuilt it all depends on where you want to live. I sold my house &amp; downsized to a condo
@mforbes37 @dannyd1976 I was thinking about this too
@JGoldsbie Paul Westerberg &lt;3
@ryantologist @felixpotvin more than you love cargo shorts?
@felixpotvin 
@the_Zubes btw still laughing at you from yday. I don't think I'll ever find it not funny
@GrinWithGuilt I know what I like &amp; will go for it, but always have to be aware of quality
@GrinWithGuilt there's something to be said for knowing what you want, but some things need a little research.
@GrinWithGuilt everything was always a power struggle w my ex. He could be a little controlling
@GrinWithGuilt 1 of the things I'm actually looking for in a guy is someone who will let me take care of the practical daily stuff.
@GrinWithGuilt sure, np. Making decisions is something I do best
@GrinWithGuilt I bought my place last yr. condo fees aren't too bad based on everything I was looking at
@GrinWithGuilt well, I know someone who bought pre-build, then the building never happened. They didn't sell enough units
@antogold they'll be ok. The sunroof was open
I've now gotten flowers 4 times in my life :) Thanks @antogold! 
Furious 7 again. I'm going to cry again &amp; watch @antogold cry too
@MsBooWho necklace for the set? 
Eating timbits meant for children. No shame 
@antogold @ryantologist @Leafer1984 I liked that move in the 7th inning when you scratched your balls for an hour.
@ryantologist @antogold @Leafer1984 "Save a line for me! WR"
@ryantologist @antogold @Leafer1984 more athletes need to autograph with words of wisdom, like 'avoid the clap'
Looks like a good time 
@ryantologist @antogold @Leafer1984 I bet you like to time yourself
@ryantologist @antogold @Leafer1984 of course that would stay w you. Great scene
@antogold @Leafer1984 *Geena damn phone
@antogold @Leafer1984 yeah, every time it's on. The end always gets me
@antogold @Leafer1984 can I be Gina Davis? I can do the splits
@MsBooWho this makes me so sad
@antogold such a great flick
@MsBooWho poor dude
@MsBooWho :( pics of the same cat?
Shanahan cleaning house 
@GrinWithGuilt so dreamy <REVOLVING HEARTS> when I posted it at the time, anyone who didn't watch the show asked if I was seeing him. HA! I WISH
Why do I not have the Sundance channel so I can watch 24 Hour Party People?
@GrinWithGuilt figured you would like this 
@GrinWithGuilt mother of dragons <FIRE>
@GrinWithGuilt that's not how I roll
@GrinWithGuilt maybe he's just bad at texts? I know I have issues
@GrinWithGuilt I noticed lol. Yeah, I slit many throats &amp; ripped out many hearts to get there. Had to look like I belonged there
@GrinWithGuilt this doesn't sound like a tinder dude if he's asking for dinner
@GrinWithGuilt it's hard to find ppl that you like &amp; w whom you want to live
@GrinWithGuilt I'm not into having a roommate. It's really not worth putting up w someone else's bullshit if you're not fucking them.
@GrinWithGuilt It would be nice to have someone to share expenses again. I miss that about having someone around.
@the_Zubes just as well it ended then
Future cosplayer walking along Bloor 
@bebek1ng been a while since I've seen both, but I know 1 of them is Canadian. Vancouver casting <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@antogold my dog jumped off the couch haha then he watched me dance the happiest of happy dances
After these dark days, there is now hope for the Leafs' future

@theactivestick any other team, I mean
@theactivestick hahaha I probably will
@theactivestick undecided if I will cheer for them. And yes, I've had sex wearing that jersey
@theactivestick there's a Sens jersey in my closet - my ex is a fan &amp; gave it to me for Valentine's Day yrs ago so I'd have something "sexy"
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 none of my shoes are, so that's ok
@dannyd1976 I'm impressed. You're quite the shoeaholic
Remote getting such a workout tonight. I really should have bought a splitter &amp; set up that extra tv in the living room
@dannyd1976 your girls are adorable
@danmacrae big windows, looked hipster. Had a sign for new &amp; used dvds &amp; cds. Seemed like the kind of place to have cassettes
@MsBooWho :( *hug*
@itsgettinglate you've survived this long. It could happen
@danmacrae is this on Spadina, south of Dundas? I walked past a place yday, but didn't stop in
@dannyd1976 @the_Zubes @zachhajas I'm not a fan either. Where do you go?
@dannyd1976 @the_Zubes @zachhajas I used to go to spot next to small airstrip in Barrie. I miss it so much. Owner would give me free buckets
@zachhajas @the_Zubes thanks, I'll give them a try. I haven't been out since before I moved. So much rust. It will be embarrassing
@the_Zubes @zachhajas so none of these are grass, just artificial?
@zachhajas @the_Zubes you mean 400 &amp; Steeles?
@justsherryj one of the worst things I've ever seen
@justsherryj saw guy get shot down proposing on kiss cam. She didn't react, so camera cut away. Panned back &amp; he's holding his head in shock
@the_Zubes #sexy
@zachhajas oops, thought I at'd both if you @the_Zubes
@zachhajas hey, can you rec a few driving ranges?
@claudvandamn awesome :) have a great day!
@bebek1ng I'm kinda surprised it's not saying the quote is from Clueless

@MsBooWho my nickname was already the ice queen due to my ability to not get affected by losing prospects haha
@MsBooWho I have same uniform of black pants, blazer, white shirt. I would mix in a few dresses though so my office didn't think I was nuts
@claudvandamn happy birthday! :)
@xarexerax happy birthday! Feel better soon :)
Told my dog that I'm a terrible owner &amp; even though he loves me, he can do better. He doesn't seem to believe me. Such a great dog
@the_Zubes @DrewGROF a large pizza for me is 3-4 meals
@the_Zubes @DrewGROF I do not consume the quantities of food that you do
@the_Zubes @DrewGROF only that 1st breakfast. If it goes longer, it gets really meh
@DrewGROF @the_Zubes I've had no issue w pasta. Pizza crust gets gross if it lasts after breakfast the next morning
@the_Zubes pasta keeps better for leftovers
@the_Zubes I've already had dinner or I would be on my way over
@justsherryj alto sax :)
@vcarneiro Northern Ontario. It will be there for a while
@DarrelGOP this makes me feel so old haha
@AlsoNamedPhil #NationalSiblingDay
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I got lucky -- my ex had no interest in those shows. We just watched diff sports/teams on 2 tvs on diff floors
<FLAG IN HOLE>️<BASEBALL>️<FLAG IN HOLE>️<BASEBALL>️<FLAG IN HOLE>️<BASEBALL>️<FLAG IN HOLE>️<BASEBALL>️
Family is more than blood. Biological &amp; adopted brothers -- happy #NationalSiblingDay &lt;3 you both
@ErikBlevins well, I had to kill everyone to get there
@MsBooWho 
@jasegiles it's fun to stop in
I will take what is mine 
Hear Me Roar! 
@KimDrosdick on my way, will be a few min late
@antogold I cry-laugh every time I think about it. A dude looked at me weird this morning
@blackdogpat #patio sounds good
ME: *puts it off for 13 day…
@blackdogpat great read! I know I'll  eventually see you in hell (all that hole touching &amp; all), but we really should have lunch soon
@antogold nice to see you being clear about it. "Down with the wave" was so equivocal haha
How much cologne is this guy wearing that it can linger in the elevator so strongly? If I ever run into him, I may not be able to breathe
Nothing a like a breath of fresh cologne in the morning
@olhnso happy birthday :)
What's in a name?
Atlanta Flames, Atlanta Thrashers
@MsBooWho clean shaven best, maybe a little scruff from missing a day or two
@dannyd1976 that would be just awful
@dannyd1976 <CRYING CAT FACE>
I can't wait to go home &amp; eat Cadbury mini eggs
@MsBooWho like your hair has a mind of its own! 
@AlsoNamedPhil @the_Zubes @DesaiDevang not at all, Phil. My favs are real. If something makes me laugh or I want to read later, I fav it.
@the_Zubes and looking at your count. Beating you next
@the_Zubes I already passed that benchmark a while ago. My new goal is to fav more than @DesaiDevang. Getting close - I started 4k behind
@inaneenglish @ryantologist having someone for both really helps
@inaneenglish @ryantologist I use an accountant too. I used to file as a business b/c self employed. 2014 will be a mess b/c mix of jobs
@DesaiDevang didn't realize it was about playoffs!!!!1 I meant the teams have not been good, but you guys are
Oh great. My phone is going to do the thing where the photos constantly restore again. Thank god I backed up yday
@DesaiDevang how does that explain anything mlse?
@justsherryj I've heard he's a pretty good guy
@AlsoNamedPhil @mlse maybe one last fight too
The Leafs really needed #character to help find their #identity at the end of the season
@AlsoNamedPhil just need something shiny &amp; gold to distract them
@mlse @AlsoNamedPhil 
@AlsoNamedPhil so you're seeing a dystopian future where raccoons rule the earth?
@sarah_connors awesome! Have a great time!
@dlbno I knew I could count on you <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@the_Zubes @DuncanIdunno yes. What works for me does not work for everyone
@DuncanIdunno to look at me, no one can guess what I'm really like. I have to trust you to remove the mask of conformity &amp; show it
@DuncanIdunno if you can find a way to have a little bit of your bad self w you &amp; only you know about it, I think it would help
@DuncanIdunno I had to be incredibly professional in office environment &amp; client meetings.
@DuncanIdunno in all honesty, I stopped wearing underwear w my suits, skirts &amp; dresses. That secret freak to go throughout the day where
@DuncanIdunno it's tricky to balance. I know your work environment &amp; I can see how it consumes you.
@DuncanIdunno do you find your work persona is becoming dominant?
@DuncanIdunno @the_Zubes need to find one that can be both
@DuncanIdunno so your line in the sand is mucus?
@ryantologist @DuncanIdunno she ran as far away as her 2 legs would take her
@ryantologist @DuncanIdunno did she laugh or was that the last date you had w her?
@justsherryj @DaveLozo Mad Love. A friend of mine loved that movie
@dlbno do you go to all the matches? You seem like the type that I should be watching the crowd to see if you're doing something stupid
@AlsoNamedPhil @ryantologist @draglikepull but Canada-wide science fair. I had to miss a lot of track meets that yr too
@AlsoNamedPhil @ryantologist @draglikepull in OAC, the girls soccer coach wanted me to play. I would have been 1 of the tallest on the team
@ryantologist @AlsoNamedPhil @draglikepull I was always 1 of the tall kids growing up. Guess my body decided to go w boobs over height
@ryantologist @draglikepull and I thought you were going to be taller lol
Tim Hortons &amp; Nutella. As with many things in life, I expect anticipation will be quickly followed by disappointment
@Leafer1984 I'm just going to assume they're not going to be as good as I think they will be
@Leafer1984 deliciously tempting fat pills
@DesaiDevang #Furious7Feels
@jasegiles @50_MissionCap #agreed
@antogold 
@50_MissionCap maybe it's the angle of the pic, but a liiittle more curve for that brim
@itsgettinglate just waiting for phones to  accidentally sext duck sicking lips at some point
@itsgettinglate hahaha the one time you need autocorrect
@mlse I wanted to see the Duff. I need to see if it's still out
@mlse he was also in O, which was not the teen movie my friends thought it was so they would see it w me
@GrinWithGuilt well, they didn't say you look old
@itsgettinglate don't forget the duck lips
@vcarneiro today is as good a day as any to watch it :)
@vcarneiro he &amp; I raided my dvd collection a few mths ago. So much he has never seen

I made a buddy watch Empire Records b/c this song came on once when we were out. He had never seen it! 
@Peter_Lynn np ;) happy birthday <PARTY POPPER>
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho yes, he is <OK HAND SIGN>
ME: [right behind her] IN A WORLD WHERE …
@Peter_Lynn glad you're still alive on the day you were born
@AndrewCieslak You're welcome :) If there's anything you want me to find, searching vk &amp; downloading is not a problem
@MsBooWho I missed who we're objectifying
Happy Rex Manning Day!!
Damn the Man. Save the Empire.
@mrsharpphoto seriously though, power kept going out &amp; my dog kept waking me up
@mrsharpphoto I wouldn't call what I was doing last night sleeping
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho and I'm loooooosing control
I already need a nap
@formerlyfrozen happy anniversary! <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
@the_Zubes 
Fuck, I'm going to be a zombie today
I learned the importance of setting a backup alarm
The power going off for a 3rd time since after midnight is stressing out my dog
@AndrewCieslak Teenage Color Mix. I think I did this right? 
@itsgettinglate I look fwd to following its creation
@ryantologist @the_Zubes look at you being an optimist
A tv show &amp; MLS team are both Chicago Fire? So creative
@bebek1ng I have been waiting since Thursday for other ppl to have them too!
@olhnso @sandwich_dad @thescottlewis then you do not want to see the excel sheet my parents use to track what they have stored lol
@sandwich_dad @olhnso @thescottlewis it all depends on your preferences
@sandwich_dad @olhnso @thescottlewis d'angelo 2005 old vines was excellent. They have a winery in Okanagan as well
@olhnso @sandwich_dad @thescottlewis wines from Southwestern Ontario are pretty decent. A few summers mimicked South France for reserve yrs
@the_Zubes dude *hug*
Yes, guy watching me do cardio, this is what I look like all sweaty &amp; breathing heavy. That's right, you save that visual for later
@justsherryj the feels! I think I'm dying
Nice lol 
Roberto! These are really great 
@TVsBrent like that's the only thing that's important
Aww someone did Red Sonja for Wondercon :( I'll have to make mine better 
"We need to put pressure on the wound!"
[to wound] We've been together 6 months now, I think we should move …
@GrinWithGuilt also stamina
@MsBooWho it's not babysitting when they're only 10yrs younger :P
@MsBooWho just enjoy it ;)
@MsBooWho those poor dogs
@MsBooWho what.the.fuck.
Best granddaughter. Only granddaughter, but still
My grandmother loved the flowers I sent her <BOUQUET><YELLOW HEART>
@ryantologist I liked what they did before. I'll have to give it a listen
@ryantologist I thought Limblifter was like a side project for those dudes when they broke up
@ryantologist and why Limblifter instead of Age of Electric?
@wraparoundcurl I'm not sure which is my fav, but I am enjoying the gun to Rowan Atkinson's head
@sashakalra &lt;3 I was planning to go on Friday!
@wraparoundcurl these are so great
@Peter_Lynn I only change my clothes in my car in parking lots, not while driving
Open sunroof while driving in the highway. I missed this
@itsgettinglate also, second cup has the best candy cane hot chocolate. I've tried them all
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang the peach juice from m&amp;m's reminds me of the old Tim Hortons. More powder, less sugary syrup
@inaneenglish it's fun. You'll like it
@AlsoNamedPhil I was curious what was corrected when I typed 'Evil' &amp; apparently the letter 'a' was added. Interesting work, phone
@AlsoNamedPhil I was curious if a Evil Carlton was going to make an appearance
@schocker17 @Leafer1984 that's also a good one
@Leafer1984 for sure. Up there w driving in blindspot, speeding up to not let you in while you're signalling, driving slow in passing lane

HEAR YE, HEAR YE: the species Brontosaurus excelsus has been reestablished, be upstanding 
@DuncanIdunno I knew you were just pretending to be a Leafs fan to fit it on the bandwagon of misery
@vcarneiro you can be logical &amp; have imagination. Would you believe that I am actually an optimistic daydreamer?
@vcarneiro those are some books you should read. Really
@vcarneiro hmmm...I can see her point
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho it started almost 12 hrs ago, so it better be
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 @schocker17 no one likes the kernels
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho @schocker17 great minds
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 @schocker17 if not done right, then yes
@dannyd1976 @ryantologist @schocker17 @MsBooWho it goes really well in my mentions
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @MsBooWho I mean, it's part of the whole experience of a night, but individual acts are separate
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @MsBooWho single dudes are selfish &amp; don't. That's why they're single
@dannyd1976 @schocker17 @MsBooWho that's counted separately. Very good to hear that you do it <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @dannyd1976 @schocker17 Ryan adds Cheetos to his pizza. I think the concept of vegetables on it is foreign to him
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho @schocker17 so only 1 mcdouble?
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho @schocker17 nice. We need to have Manhattans again. I won't drive this time
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 @MsBooWho you don't find it makes you too full? Seems like a good snack after
@DuncanIdunno hmm...I don't think I like that
@DuncanIdunno I haven't updated, so I'm not sure what you mean. Embeds like when copy link to tweet?
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho @schocker17 are you counting the nights you drunk walk home &amp; pee on trees?
@DuncanIdunno what happened w manual RT?
@DuncanIdunno ummm...killing animals for money?
@DuncanIdunno dude :( it truly sucks
@GrinWithGuilt @justsherryj haha no worries. I can walk into an emotional storm &amp; be unharmed. Like Khaleesi &amp; fire
@justsherryj @GrinWithGuilt yes! The more the merrier
@GrinWithGuilt sounds like a plan <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@GrinWithGuilt I've had the same fwb since my split. Having him around helps, but it's not the same
@GrinWithGuilt both are proving to be true. I will never settle, but I know a good thing when I see it. I'll pursue, be patient, whatever
@GrinWithGuilt it was, but I had a good lawyer, so I did alright splitting assets ;) kidding aside, it's hard, but I'm more myself now
@GrinWithGuilt I was like "what the hell is wrong w guys now?!" The longest I've kept someone around is 6 dates over 1.5mths
@GrinWithGuilt oh yeah,you're not the problem. Became single cpl yrs ago after 10yrs w my ex &amp; it is different world than what I was used to
@schocker17 @MsBooWho @dannyd1976 this doesn't mean that a minute is ok, fyi
@MsBooWho @schocker17 @dannyd1976 don't really want to be drumming my fingers waiting for it to end
@MsBooWho @schocker17 @dannyd1976 agreed
@daftpuck I've never seen Cheddar Bacon. So, grocery store tmrw...
"A newt?" "I got better." 
@GrinWithGuilt some guys just don't want to grow up. And they have unrealistic expectations for what a relationship is like
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 @MsBooWho not great for quickies
@GrinWithGuilt the mom. Micromanages everything. Obv, not all cases, just my experience
@GrinWithGuilt yeah, some can stress about that a lot. I honestly have to say that Jewish dudes seemed to be the worst for me
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 hahaha I've been fortunate to find a superman or 2 over the yrs. Like, Matt Good Beautiful Midnight cd repeated
@dannyd1976 Guys that are single can't handle casual hook ups that partner-in-crime never even crosses my mind w anyone
@dannyd1976 donor thing is a joke, but serious. I'm thinking 2018. Gives me 3 more yrs to have fun &amp; be stupid
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho I have thoughts on this that I'm keeping to myself. For now lol
@GrinWithGuilt you just described all guys, but yes, some friends &amp; I who are down w brown dudes have noticed this
@MsBooWho @dannyd1976 that's exactly how I describe myself. An acquired taste. The Laphroig of scotches
@itsgettinglate @PaddyGurks sounds good. Look into stamped concrete over interlock
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho think of all the stuff you've haven't seen by not following Boo earlier lol
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho hahaha a lot of fun that you missed out on
@itsgettinglate if you pave it, sports all yr round -- bball, hockey
@PaddyGurks @itsgettinglate and a swing set
@itsgettinglate actually, stamped concrete
@itsgettinglate interlock &amp; have a huge patio
@itsgettinglate how big is the yard?
@itsgettinglate I'm not a gardener either. Let me see if I still have a pic on my phone
@itsgettinglate then get a hot tub &amp; have no grass
@itsgettinglate house was 2story walkout, so the deck was off kitchen on main floor. We just did patio around the basement door
@itsgettinglate when I had a yard, we just kept seeding &amp; fertilizing. Took few yrs for grass. Morning sun, then shade rest of day
@itsgettinglate are you looking for suggestions besides sod?
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang I miss seeing this pic 
Female: You seem to have a good head on your shoulders.
Male: Yeah well, you know, saving …
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang oh wow. I guess ppl are ok?
@DesaiDevang there are a few banks near that intersection -- which one?
@MsBooWho the smile on his face tells me he may also be enjoying himself (she's smiling too, so good for her) 
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho I was thinking Rocky, but will accept Cake
@MsBooWho maybe the problem has always been the males? Maybe she's like "FINALLY!!!!1" Lady pandas just waiting for a man to go the distance
@Snatchera @SkierSask @CarcelMousineau @MsBooWho so the timing is right. Pass along bday wishes :)
@SkierSask @CarcelMousineau @MsBooWho I was in elevator &amp; it wouldn't send :(
@SkierSask @CarcelMousineau @MsBooWho stampede
@mlse @CarcelMousineau @MsBooWho  or on top of or underneath or
@CarcelMousineau @MsBooWho my theory is that sundress season is the reason why there are so many March birthdays
Get some
@MsBooWho I can't help that no shirt can contain them
@MsBooWho nobody told me it stopped being in season
@MsBooWho I saw. It will happen later this wk
@MsBooWho only Palpatine's for me. Still need the Iron Throne
Apparently, I'm not the only one 
Excited for Suicide Squad! 
So aggressive &amp; vicious 
@wraparoundcurl same
@wraparoundcurl I can't believe I almost forgot about this. Thank you <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Don't mind me, just taking screenshots of optimistic Jays fans tweets
@MsBooWho @vcarneiro @dannyd1976 we'll always have each other &amp; anonymous sperm donors
@MsBooWho @vcarneiro @dannyd1976 that is likely true. &lt;3 u Boo
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho @dannyd1976  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@MsBooWho @vcarneiro @dannyd1976 a few mths before I was 30 was when it started for me too
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho @dannyd1976 I lmao when guys tell me I'm not gf material. They have no idea what it means to be in a partnership
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho @dannyd1976 it took over 2yrs for mine to finally end. It's not easy
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho also, your wife is cool
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho 
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho the fact that ppl keep agreeing I should get tests for Asperger's is new. I have to agree w them on that one
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho not being dead inside is a fairly recent development past year &amp; half. It's why I had to get out of commission sales
@MsBooWho we were pretty easy going about the stuff. He asked for things &amp; I was like "I thought you were already taking that"
@MsBooWho I'm enjoying not being dead inside. Feels good
LRT I took pics of the dvds my ex took in our split. There are a few I miss, but I have yet to replace. Prob b/c I stopped buying dvds
@claudvandamn I got lucky. Had to change mine a little for insta
@claudvandamn I was wondering who that was hahaha
@claudvandamn btw, add me. Same username as here
@claudvandamn so this? Lol 
@claudvandamn I'm actually pretty bad about opening snaps. I forget that there was a notification, so hrs later...
@mrsharpphoto have car, will travel
@sashakalra there is so much wrong w that
@mrsharpphoto not a single arena has a skate? I swear I went to one in Richmond hill last summer
@ryantologist I like that you made a championship belt for yourself for your pic
@inaneenglish work on cosplays &amp; watch Winter Soldier?
@mrsharpphoto I just started doing backwards crossovers &amp; I want to practice
@DesaiDevang Why are they even heckling children? Racist scumbags
@mrsharpphoto @bebek1ng yeah, I'll be there. I need to look up public skate times. I'm not sure if the schedule has already changed
@inaneenglish @bebek1ng no kidding
@inaneenglish @bebek1ng "I told you to not get mad, so I'm not being condescending"
@inaneenglish @bebek1ng "don't get mad while I belittle you"
@mrsharpphoto @bebek1ng appreciate that :)
@inaneenglish @bebek1ng I had to leave a bar last night b/c I couldn't stand to listen to some guy while watching Leafs &amp; soccer
@bebek1ng I feel you. Almost all of my clothes have logos for various sports teams or comic characters on them
@inaneenglish @bebek1ng what the fuck is wrong w guys that girls can't possibly like their hobbies?
@bebek1ng @inaneenglish /almost choked on water
I have the weirdest dreams when I drink vodka
@daftpuck not chocolate lol I kinda took myself on a pub crawl
I don't think I can keep listening to the conversation beside me for the rest of the game
Debating whether I should hit a 3rd bar for the night
@mrsharpphoto @ruhee_ pick a place &amp; let me know
@DuncanIdunno I'm sure there are enough girls w daddy issues on whom that particular look would work
@mrsharpphoto @ruhee_ I'm free tmrw if you're looking for ppl to watch w you
The blueberries are smoked. So good. 
Brisket 
@annnbug you'll be on your flight in no time :)
@annnbug safe travels for the rest of your journey
@annnbug that sucks :( I slept at O'Hare once when my flight was cancelled. Find an outlet &amp; charge your devices. I hope they've improved.
Thank you, person who had bbq in the elevator, for inspiring me to take myself out to dinner tonight
@DesaiDevang the fact that Djokovic looks like he's wearing the same shirt is not helping
@chrisjlund 

Deleting pics from my phone. I have no idea who to credit for some of these when I use them
@chrisjlund because all the TO sports teams need everyone distracted &amp; complaining about something else
@MsBooWho oh, it's still funny
@SupJess__ that last one prob worked the best <WINE GLASS><WINE GLASS><WINE GLASS>
@MsBooWho this is sounding less like medicine &amp; more like some kind of torture porn
@RegressedPDO so sorry to hear :( hope for the best &amp; that things will be ok for you &amp; your family
*looks at itinerary of parents' trip &amp; sees this wknd is just blocked off as AMSTERDAM* Yup
@DesaiDevang 
@bebek1ng I really should have planned better &amp; gone to a bakery to get some this wknd
@bebek1ng I haven't had them in ages. My mom used to make them, but I haven't been w family for Easter since high school
@mrsharpphoto @bebek1ng I remember learning that on a recorder when I was a kid
@bebek1ng I like them as well. Now there are 2 of us
@itsgettinglate I have a lot of fun w abstract art &amp; Rorschach pictures lol
@itsgettinglate When I look at this, it's like there are 2 profiles &amp; there is a dark, evil creature peering over you kid's shoulder
@itsgettinglate plush, kissable lips are in. It'll be fine.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@bebek1ng I saw it mentioned a few times before it showed up. I was ready for it
@bebek1ng the snake? Lol
@sashakalra yeah, I'm sitting here thinking I should go out
@chrisjlund you're a Treasure Just the Way You Are.
@sashakalra don't forget the Leafs. I changed it up &amp; went out for TFC's loss this afternoon
@lasergirl70 happy birthday!
@itsgettinglate I think there was deal for 8, 9 &amp; 10 while 7 was being made?
@justsherryj she made my She-Hulk. I'll have to start on the accessories
@justsherryj for sure. My friend @scifeyecandy makes awesome Sailor scout bathing suits. 
I'm sitting at a table w 2 adorable little boys, so I really have to bite my tongue. For real lol
O when the Reds... #TFCLive 
@justsherryj Sailor Moon for me too. Not huge into anime, but I enjoy it
@justsherryj I've never been &amp; figure I'll check it out. Need to check it against TFC schedule. I can't remember if home game that wknd


@justsherryj are you going to anime north? I think I now have a project for the next mth -- making Sailor Pluto's staff &amp; belt of keys
@justsherryj just gorgeous. I also really like Sailor Uranus. I think b/ I want to short blonde wig haha
@MsBooWho lolololol
@justsherryj I want to cosplay as her, but everyone thinks I should be Sailor Jupiter
@justsherryj it's just the best. His wife knitted the cape &amp; cowl
@justsherryj *has a Joker costume
@justsherryj my future children will have the best Hallowe'en costumes
@justsherryj this was my fave from a few wks ago. I should send it to my brother -- he had a joker costume 
@justsherryj I love taking pics of the kids at comic con &amp; fan expo. It's so great b/c they're so excited about their characters
@justsherryj for sure! My nephew's Hallowe'en costume 
@dannyd1976 if it's that important to you &amp; you have extra $, buy another
@dannyd1976 would the seller be willing to refund it?
@dannyd1976 if it's working, then I guess keep it?
@dannyd1976 dude :( if he refunds, will you try another?
@justsherryj last summer, there was a dad in my building out in the yard directing &amp; filming his kids acting out scenes w lightsabers &lt;3
My dog has been snoring. He is not a fan
I've been in bed watching soccer for 2.5hrs
&lt;3 
@MsBooWho hahaha I'm sure he was impressed. Good thing hair grows back
@MsBooWho I thought he was more black. It's been a while
@MsBooWho ADORABLE! MINE IS SNUGGLING ME RIGHT NOW
@MsBooWho a mini Sprocket. For sure when your dog gets his grey beard
@KimDrosdick thanks :) have a good wknd
@KimDrosdick let's do 12
@KimDrosdick Friday is good for me
@KimDrosdick just checked your hrs on your site -- are you in today?
@ErikBlevins I can't wait to hear how much you love it
@MsBooWho like how fine wines mature
@MsBooWho and a weird, weird person that I still am. You're still weird too
@ErikBlevins just looking at the cast. So Canadian
@GrinWithGuilt @phylliskessel13 
@MsBooWho an excellent way
@GrinWithGuilt @phylliskessel13 brunch partners are hard to find

I would've gotten a pic, but when I reached for my phone in my pocket, all the dogs went into treat mode &amp; stopped playing
I don't think I've ever seen a greyhound play posture before. They're usually rescues &amp; don't know how to play
@justsherryj I've never had them, so I'll take your word for it
@BonksMullet happy birthday!
US: Yay
TV: X-FILES
US: Yay
TV: MR. SHOW
US: Yay
TV: COACH
US: Um
TV: FULL HOUSE
US: Uh
TV: JUST TELL ME …
@HeyMyNameIsWill going into it, my ranking was 5,1,6,3,2,4. I'm trying to decide if I like it more than 6 or if it's just Paul Walker feels
@HeyMyNameIsWill I should note the eye rolling was not related to anything Paul Walker. When you see it, you'll know
@HeyMyNameIsWill there was one moment where I could feel my eyes starting to roll, but overall it was great
@HeyMyNameIsWill I figure I will see it again sometime. I have 4 2-for-1 admission coupons to use that expire this mth
@HeyMyNameIsWill I was expecting it &amp; trying not to, but it still happened. If an emotionless robot like me can shed a tear, you will too
@HeyMyNameIsWill yes :) and don't be afraid to cry in public
I know it was a while ago. Maybe The Dark Knight?
I'm having a hard time remembering the last time I was at a theatre where ppl applauded at the end.
For anyone not awake at 1am, my immediate rxns sitting in theatre 
Thinking about the end of #Furious7 as I wake up &amp; my eyes are tearing up <CRYING FACE>
@jennyquarx you had me worried lol
@ryantologist @ErikBlevins it's still something you could do &amp; have a longer ep at the conclusion for 7
@ryantologist @ErikBlevins @RFVVPodcast I'm actually surprised you didn't have anything leading up to Furious 7
@ryantologist @ErikBlevins I expect a @RFVVPodcast podcast at some point on the series
@schocker17 I could see the dude next to me explaining things to his date. You'll be fine
@schocker17 Nope. But you should watch them at some point
@jennyquarx oh gurl, you need to see it in theatre. Some things just need a big screen experience
@jasegiles sweet!
@jasegiles injury or your league is done? #kostkakup is late August
Yeah, you're going to cry
The theatre applauded at the end of #Furious7
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@antogold  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ flowers are flowers. I've only gotten them 3 times in my life &amp; 2 of those were for past bdays
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang @the_Zubes I can't look at watches anymore
@itsgettinglate I blame @DesaiDevang &amp; @the_Zubes
@MsBooWho we all did
@KimDrosdick do you do ring repairs?
@thescottlewis @KimDrosdick thanks!
@Mariia19 @BonksMullet I fully expect to cry tonight
Can anyone rec a jeweller in TO? My ring band split. It's over 100yrs old, so don't really want to go to some random
@BonksMullet @Mariia19 I'm going later tonight
@itsgettinglate @dlbno @e_gilbert @npsport don't forget meerkat
@MsBooWho I've lost so many pets over the yrs :( I know I will be destroyed when Hemi dies
He looked not as stressed out as last time, so I'm going w celebrating being done something
The screenwriter getting high at noon again.
2 adorable babies in the elevator were trying to "woof" at my dog. Brb, need new ovaries
@langluy so true. Russian friend's mom is a doctor, gynaecology, &amp; he told me how it is so different there.
@formerlyfrozen happy birthday! :) we'll have to have drinks next time you're in Canada
@dannyd1976 @AlsoNamedPhil @MsBooWho you are very lucky. I've only had my paternal grandmother for the past decade.
@MsBooWho me too :) such a great read
My grandfather was her second husband after she divorced the 1st. He was 9 yrs younger than her. An original cougar ;) she was awesome
LRT makes me think of my late grandmother &amp; her stories. Sneaking out of the house to party as teen, the depression, the war, her 1st hubby
@annnbug good luck with the move!
@fergus30 happy birthday! <PARTY POPPER><BIRTHDAY CAKE>
@dlbno why am I not surprised that you're a book snob? Lol
@dlbno you would rather die than read?
@justsherryj that sounds really cool. I'll write back if you do. Fyi I have terrible handwriting
@MsBooWho don't you hear stupid things everyday?
@DesaiDevang you're not going to die alone #AprilFools
@gourmetspud <CRYING FACE>
@sandwich_dad did you ever get that key lime cookie recipe?
@NigelCadbury I actually like them
@justsherryj I did hear Aquaman was not bad
So, squats &amp; lunges
@justsherryj I stopped at final crisis. I don't really read much anymore. Just Sex Criminals. I picked up a few Red Sonja for cosplay ref
@justsherryj I haven't read any of the 52. Just can't do it
@DesaiDevang he has a new show called Undateable
Got my Fan Expo ticket for Sept :) I've got cosplay work to do in the next few mths
@phylliskessel13 the good news is that I don't think anyone will ever try fake STDs today
“@phylliskessel13: Seriously guys, fake engagements today are embarrassing. Sequester yourselves.” Also fake pregnancies
@chrisjlund @TSNSteveLloyd I'm an Aries, but the blood type is right...
@sunlightwarden @phylliskessel13 he's Rottweiler/Wheaten cross
@phylliskessel13 thank you -- yours too
@NigelCadbury of course
@phylliskessel13 mine can pull off adorable w his eyes closed 
@50_MissionCap some other ppl had glitches earlier
@GoldAndOrSmith also, eww. At least there are no images attached to those tweets
@GoldAndOrSmith I think I saw someone say the problem is w tweetdeck?
@claudvandamn sports joy is an elusive creature. You can't chase it -- it has to come to you
@claudvandamn Leafs hostage? Your brother has been forcing this on you? You poor thing *pats hair*
@itsgettinglate I liked it. Genuinely laughed out loud. Maybe I can also relate. Single after 10yrs w my ex &amp; I'm an acquired taste.
@itsgettinglate watching now, will get back to you
@Leafer1984 or I just always spill food on myself
@Leafer1984 it makes my skin soft &amp; delicious
Can't take me anywhere, but I am really great at doing laundry
Don't mind me, just dripping garlic butter on myself
@itsgettinglate it's been ok, but not holding my attn lately. I find I get distracted doing other things when I watch it.
@Heisenbergkamp you're not the only one. I'll still give it a chance
@itsgettinglate this episode or in general? Pvr'ing to watch later
@SuicidePass I hope you don't see these ppl around Halloween. Jesus, what is wrong w them that they are so ignorant?
@SuicidePass what?!
@JoeYerdon @justsherryj agreed
@vcarneiro Hemi has no issue taking down bigger dogs. Like the engine after which he was named - solid build &amp; goes like hell
Size matters not 
@clrkaitken the atmosphere in the arena is so fun too -- school bands play, all the students, the chants
@clrkaitken the games are so great to watch. I've been going to NCAA games since 2011. The experience is nothing like NHL imo
Sweet! My Frozen Four tix found a good home :) Next yr in Tampa for sure
@sarah_connors I am actually going to sell my tix for thurs &amp; sat. Not making the trip
All set for #Furious7 on Thursday! 
@ErikBlevins @AlsoNamedPhil sounds good :) enjoy Montreal. I saw your tweets about that trip -- should be fantastic
@AlsoNamedPhil thank you for lunch :) my turn next
@vcarneiro @AlsoNamedPhil grilled cheese buns
@ErikBlevins @AlsoNamedPhil the ppl demand a Blevins visit for triple dinner
@draglikepull <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 38 yrs old, never kissed a girl <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> And I wonder / When I sing along with you <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@vcarneiro nice!
My singing partner at the next table left doing a little dance to JLo If You Had My Love
Wonder Years theme song. This is the place to be this afternoon
@ErikBlevins @AlsoNamedPhil we were talking about triple dinner for your visit at wvrst Sat night. We'll add lunch to the agenda
@schocker17 @AlsoNamedPhil yes. You should do it next time
Followed up by Crash into Me, the one song of DM's I love b/c it reminds of someone from university. He was my drug.
Two Princes came on &amp; @AlsoNamedPhil knew I would start singing. Dude at another table humming along &amp; girl at counter joining in was fun
Lunch w @AlsoNamedPhil. Always Vatican-style the buns

@MsBooWho I've loved this song since I first heard it in Clue
Martha Stewart <FIRE>

No more free ride, assholes! 
@katiebakes Devon Sawa <REVOLVING HEARTS> now I know why you mentioned him the other day
@dannyd1976 so you're just going to look at it mint in the box? It'll be fine
@dlbno well, he came back to Ontario to visit he past 2 summers, so it is my turn to go west
@dlbno he &amp; his bf just bought a condo. I'm told I need to visit this summer
@dlbno he was in Vancouver for a few yrs before moving there, I think 2 yrs ago. Also lived in Victoria for a long time
@dlbno your Vancouver pics have no effect on me. One of my brothers lives in Kelowna.
@dlbno though it had been a long time since I felt as carefree as I did when I was Harley Quinn. It is fun being the villain.
@dlbno hmmm...they all have qualities I admire, which is why I choose them. Wonder Woman. Strength, confidence, love &amp; compassion.
@dlbno truth
@dlbno what do you not like about yourself that you just can't change, no matter how hard you try?
@dlbno I think you meant tell me later in your prev tweet
@dlbno tell me other?
So, my Tues &amp; Wed nights are now booked. Just in time, amazon 
@dlbno so you'll tell after your wedding day? Or do I get to ask another truth?
@dlbno when did you know your girl was the one?
@dlbno truth or dare
@MsBooWho I should probably concerned that he watches me undress all the time
Next to me 
I think he likes having that tether to me. He always has to be near me when we're just hanging out at home.
I sometimes wonder if my dog misses walking off leash, but earlier at the elevator from the parking garage, he looked at me to leash him
@justsherryj I think it looks really cute
@ryantologist “@BillMc7: her: did you put cheetos on your spaghetti??
me: you mean spaghetti croutons?”
@RFVVPodcast I still haven't listened to the ones that aren't on iTunes
@bebek1ng <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> Yo I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@dlbno damnit you're going to make me get this app now
@ryantologist @Leafer1984 "drunks who can’t get their shit together until early afternoon"is my fav part,but I usually have this issue sober
@itsgettinglate same. I have 5 of them still in use
@dlbno so you're all about meerkat now instead of snap, eh?
The full article if anyone is interested  
@MsBooWho sexy Boo ;)
LRT Helen Mirren is amazing &amp; I have always loved her
@itsgettinglate @dlbno @DesaiDevang add me if you like. Same username
@itsgettinglate @dlbno @DesaiDevang I bet. I can see taking better care of his ass than his toes
@dlbno @itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang thanks. I'll be sure to return the favour for any gross appendages (It won't, but the threat is real)
@itsgettinglate @DesaiDevang was it recent? When @dlbno added me, I was told I'm excluded from butt snaps. Wonder if weird toes included lol
@MsBooWho we all have our triggers &amp; it's perfectly normal to react. It was coming from a few directions, so I see why. All good, Boo
@dannyd1976 @MsBooWho @NigelCadbury @schocker17 your socks are just meh. Where's the colour?
@MsBooWho *hug*
@vcarneiro @MsBooWho @dannyd1976 @NigelCadbury @schocker17 same
@wraparoundcurl @kellysue you all look awesome!
@fergus30 always important <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Actually, Taylor, boys only want love if it involves the smallest amount…
@dlbno @DesaiDevang 
@phylliskessel13 is there a link?
I miss the days when I didn't have to put on pants to let my dog out before bed
@sandwich_dad awesome, thanks :)
@sandwich_dad any chance you can pass along the recipe?
@sandwich_dad I am key lime green with envy
@sandwich_dad did you bring them back from Florida or find some here?
@sandwich_dad yes. Heavenly
@itsgettinglate it has been :) hope yours was also great
@itsgettinglate no worries :) life gets busy &amp; I'm just some person from the internet. Eventually remembering means a lot :) Thanks
My brother in Kelowna is awesome. I can always count on him to call me out when I'm being insensitive &amp; give some perspective

@ryantologist @ruhee_ quit ruining my visual!
@ruhee_ hmmm...I'd still match it. Or make a sock puppet
@ryantologist @ruhee_ while wearing cargo shorts, I bet
@ruhee_  (Please note that I do have matched pairs that I wear when others will see my socks)
@ruhee_ am I the only person who wears mismatched socks from the lost singles?
@GrinWithGuilt not really worth the price of admission. I think commercials would be longer than that flick
@GrinWithGuilt it would have to be set for if the bus moved at all
This may be the dumbest q ever, but I really don't know. These are pencils- just for lining or also fill in? 
Hey! The Rock clinched the playoffs. Good work 
Toronto just can't have nice sports things

My parents called from Prague to wish me a belated happy bday. They had emailed, but I didn't think I was going to hear from them &lt;3

@NigelCadbury @schocker17 we've met before, so I'm not worried
@NigelCadbury thanks! It will be much better than last night haha
@bookofloob happy bday! Looking back, it was yday?
@mererog for Future Shop? I was surprised too
@Snatchera thanks! :)
@theactivestick thank you! It's starting out pretty good :)
@theninjagreg thanks :)
@draglikepull thank you!
@Green52fan time is flying! My brother called me an old maid this morning lol
@AlsoNamedPhil thank you. The lab is a cold &amp; sterile place. May your experiments produce results
@Green52fan thank you! :)
@vcarneiro thanks! Hope you're able to stop by wvrst later. Have fun at work :)
@WashCapsRock thank you! I plan to haha
@Peter_Lynn it worked out lol thanks :)
@ErikBlevins thanks again! Have a great triple dinner!
4:28am. Yup. Old
@NigelCadbury I try to do it about once a mth. It should be more frequent
@NigelCadbury I saved them separately  on my other laptop, which doesn't have iTunes on it. Currently backing those to external hd
@NigelCadbury I have all the pics
@NigelCadbury starting from scratch w the other stuff if the back up doesn't happen is not a big deal
@NigelCadbury I don't care about the rest of the info, I pulled the phone numbers of everyone I texted past few mths.
@NigelCadbury iCloud is still backing up &amp; I'll create another one on my laptop after, as long as it can connect to iTunes again
Thank you, Apple product, for fucking me in a way I had never been fucked before. It was an experience I do not want to repeat
And I thought I wasn't going to get lucky on my bday. Not in the way I had hoped, but I'll take it
Was able to recover my pics &amp; I'm pretty sure they're all there
THERE IS A GOD &amp; I AM LOVED
@AlsoNamedPhil it's really my own fault. I was going to back up this morning, but I slept in instead
@AlsoNamedPhil I'm trying to turn off photos to try to back up everything else to iCloud. Every time I think I have it turned off, nope
@AlsoNamedPhil this was not what I had planned on doing tonight
@AlsoNamedPhil the sad thing is that u only want the recent pics, but it crashes &amp; restores before I can get them. I can grab the old pics
@AlsoNamedPhil I have photo files separate on my laptop, so I can at least get until feb 13th of this yr
@AlsoNamedPhil all my pics from comic con will be gone if I can't do a recovery w phone rescue or something. Thank god I tweeted a bunch
@AlsoNamedPhil basically
@Peter_Lynn the photos just keep restoring. I want to die
@AlsoNamedPhil he thought the back up may have been corrupted when it was trying to back up &amp; wouldn't
@AlsoNamedPhil dude, the guy on the phone from apple had me delete my backup since it wouldn't do a back up
@AlsoNamedPhil and now it won't connect to the update server. I want to die
@AlsoNamedPhil I will likely have to try recovery software. Fuck fuck fuck
@AlsoNamedPhil and I can see on iTunes that my photos have turned into 'other'
@AlsoNamedPhil that the pics are there -- it just keeps restoring so likely that last file is corrupted. Was on the phone w apple for hrs
@AlsoNamedPhil backing up my phone was on my agenda for today. I took 1 pic &amp; the fucking thing crashed. I can see by the free space
Kill me now
The photos just keep restoring over &amp; over
I bought garlic butter from 2 diff vendors at #OOAKS15, so garlic toast everyday for the next while
@abrant23 it was just pics that didn't immediately restore. I have too many to use cloud to back them up
@ErikBlevins thank you :) it's tmrw, but I make my bday a long wknd, even if it's not Easter
It has started to restore, but I know what I will be doing for the next few hrs
Always back up your phone. Mine rebooted itself &amp; my heart stopped b/c my pics folder was empty &amp; it has been 2wks since my last
I love how terrified this sheep looks @leoraisrael! At the One Of A Kind show booth P48D #OOAKS15 
@formerlyfrozen I haven't used it in a while. The only person I normally skype is my brother in BC
@torontofc you're right, it's a cool shirt, but it's no boat anchor shirt
@SkinnyPPPhish @antogold I would like a loop of it playing on a screen embedded in my tombstone
@SkinnyPPPhish @antogold I really liked 6. I think for me 5, 1, 6, TD, 2, 4
@antogold I'm so distracted by the laptops &amp; phones in TD that I don't even notice the flaws anymore. The mountain race is great
@wraparoundcurl @inaneenglish so badass! Love it
@DesaiDevang @JGoldsbie doesn't @dannyd1976 know one of the animators?

<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> Cause you're a good dog &amp; you know it <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
My dog wants #OVO gear 
@vcarneiro I was frozen, then hit a GoodLife to warm up in the shower &amp; go out for the night
@HeyMyNameIsWill thanks, but it is tmrw. I've been making it a long wknd the past few yrs -- days of celebrating!
@CarcelMousineau tmrw actually :) thank you
I had never even watched a TFC match &amp; I took myself as part of my birthday wknd. Yes, I froze my ass off in the stands in March
This wknd will be the 2 yr anniversary of my going to TFC games :)
My Frozen 4 tix arrived the other day but I have been so meh about NHL that I haven't even bothered to keep up w NCAA
@JaredOfLondon @GrinWithGuilt crazy eyes
@Leafer1984 sometimes it's pregnant women, but they really should be showing to do that
@GrinWithGuilt @JaredOfLondon he was so great at guarding water bottles
@justsherryj Royal Alexandra next Jan/Feb. After that, Rupert Everett will be Oscar Wilde in Judas Kiss
Some upcoming productions look great. Gaslight will be at the theatre next yr &amp; I think I want to see it

@DesaiDevang long live apathy 2015
@HBAdventure @Leafer1984 before the headshot, would you have said Savard was on track for hhof? He was good &amp; consistent, but not stand out
@itsgettinglate happy birthday! Hope you have a great day :)
@DuncanIdunno to do the dishes?
@schocker17 @DuncanIdunno what about the tall dude? Bill Fagerbakke
@DuncanIdunno such a Responsible Adult
@schocker17 @DuncanIdunno I like him too much for him to play that monster
@schocker17 @DuncanIdunno nononononononono
@_danmcc np :)
@_danmcc Perfect Strangers
@vcarneiro you likely know some of the ones I also had saved lol
@vcarneiro I couldn't tell you the last time I used it. I want to say when I finished grad school in 2008
@AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 I'll let your imagination run wild
@draglikepull @AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 to be fair, my ex &amp; I got together in 2002
@draglikepull @AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 ummm...probably?
@AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 messenger no longer exists, right? I had some custom emoticons from images &amp; gifs saved to the keyboard
@schocker17 lololol that does not mean surprised to me
@AlsoNamedPhil @schocker17 everyone also used to use the surprised emoticon on messenger to mean blow job, right?
@schocker17 thank you :)
@schocker17 but there is no surprise to that. My family doesn't do gifts &amp; my gram sent a cheque
@AndrewCieslak he did not age well
It's going to be hard to look surprised all the time when things never seem to shock me
The girl cut my bangs too short the other day. I feel like I'll need to keep my eyebrows raised for about a wk until they grow out
@justsherryj the whole list is great
@itsgettinglate @dlbno my 1st breakfast is also liquid. I snack all day
@dlbno @itsgettinglate this sounds like man who has had to wait in line for many brunches
@itsgettinglate I always want hashbrowns around 1pm
@itsgettinglate breakfast should be all day
@chrisjlund @DesaiDevang "Single4Lyfe"
@schocker17 @dannyd1976 they should be giving it away
@justsherryj I asked my tutor to pick up a copy for me next time she goes home to Russia. I want to read it untranslated
@justsherryj obv the Batman &amp; the Hobbit rooms, but Crime &amp; Punishment is my fav novel. I have to stay there
@MrButterChicken I'm pretty sure a soul patch is grounds for a divorce
@dlbno I didn't know you had gone to hell!
@sashakalra but I still have so many woes
@leoraisrael hahahaha
I'll prob think of it when I'm trying to fall asleep
I had an idea for a latex dress the other day &amp; now I completely forget the character
@TVsBrent since he stopped coaching in 1997, I hope they have all graduated.
@leoraisrael @JGoldsbie is that offer available for tmrw?
@itsgettinglate I've had the nachos at pro club. They were actually pretty good
@vcarneiro are you able to come to wvrst Sat?
@MsBooWho you? Not at all
@AlsoNamedPhil sweet :) excellent timing
@AlsoNamedPhil it's your turn to buy lunch too, isn't it?
@antogold maybe b/c I'm from Northern Ontario, but I grew up w snow still on the ground in May. It even snowed in June the yr I was born
@AlsoNamedPhil Mon or Tues work for me
@AlsoNamedPhil lunch sounds good :) maybe next wk?
@dannyd1976 I asked a few others to come Sat too. Not sure who is still in @MsBooWho @antogold @bebek1ng @AlsoNamedPhil
@dannyd1976 @ryantologist @mlse @mforbes37 @the_Zubes @mschocker I'll be there :)
@antogold so, so great
@JohnMolinaro I'm in the same boat. I asked someone about mth ago to help.  Never answered, so I've been reading &amp; watching on my own.
@HeyMyNameIsWill no doubt they will be spectacular! Best Picture quality ;)
@HeyMyNameIsWill nice! I need to get mine for next Thurs
@evalois I thought those were the reasons why we do anything?
@AlsoNamedPhil @HeyMyNameIsWill no one can compare
@AlsoNamedPhil @HeyMyNameIsWill there's only one Jack Bauer
@HeyMyNameIsWill @AlsoNamedPhil emergency override w the pilots
@HeyMyNameIsWill I was at a funeral just after Xmas for 23yr old who gave no sign to anyone. His last msg was to go for sushi. Hung himself
@HeyMyNameIsWill but also, if someone wants to kill themselves &amp; don't want to be stopped, they will hide it.
@HeyMyNameIsWill like for grief counselling, etc. I had a bitch of a time setting up mine when I went to sessions after my split
@HeyMyNameIsWill I was also thinking that any FT job, things like counselling are available, but no one ever knows how to access it
@HeyMyNameIsWill it's a start
@HeyMyNameIsWill 1 article said that in Europe, if someone leaves, FA does not take their place so always 2 ppl present, unlike here.
Can you imagine how the passengers felt watching the pilot trying to get in the door?
@KDesai18 guess you'll have to step up the tweets since @DesaiDevang logged off. His tweets during various sporting events &lt;3
@justsherryj some advice that I need to take myself -- if it's important, you'll make time
@justsherryj time's always a killer. It's great that you have an outlet until inspiration strikes again. You'll find your muse :)
@justsherryj is there anything stopping you from starting to draw again?
@bebek1ng so sorry to hear. My sympathies. It's not easy
@MsBooWho @ryantologist @schocker17 I don't think anyone bothers to ask me if I'm travelling w friends. It's just assumed that I'm solo

@ryantologist @ErikBlevins MT @TheAVClub Stallone really enjoys killing people (on camera) 
#blessed #blessed #blessed #blessed 

@katiebakes Little Giants! I remember him from the Odyssey too - so many cutie Canadians on that show
@fergus30 not at all! I've done that w all the places where I've lived
@annnbug congrats &amp; good luck w the move! It would've been fun to eventually meet you &amp; see the delicious food you post on IG in person :)
@sir_jamez I would have if I could. Now would be lunch
@langluy but the clerk will be if they keep saying stuff like that
@MrButterChicken not for the office lol seriously though, that town shoes on path saved me from a shoe emergency
@MsBooWho haha I know. I thought I was picky until I met you
@MsBooWho being Boo doesn’t mean you’re immune to sexy times
@MrButterChicken you laugh but it happens. I once had to buy shoes on my way to the office when I was working dt
@ErikBlevins 1st breakfast was 630, so yes
It's never too early for second breakfast
@bebek1ng one of my fav shows
@ryantologist @hochman I was on a flight w the Olsen twins once -- LA to TO. They were across the aisle from me in business class
@ErikBlevins “@sassyhedgehogs: if ur feeling sad, just look at this little hedgehog 
@dannyd1976 I read about that tonight too. Just awful
@ToniMacAttack sorry to hear &amp; I hope he'll be ok. I have DVT -- it's not too bad once being treated.
Also, I love that the area code for that tfln was southwestern Ontario. My money is on UWO students
@NigelCadbury yes it is
I went out on a date after my 1st time painted as She-Hulk 2 yrs ago &amp; I kept getting asked for my number at last yr's FanExpo
LRT don't get it twisted -- being painted green makes you irresistible
@TVsBrent meow that would be disappointing
Another Super Troopers? I'm going to go chug maple syrup in celebration
@JoeYerdon not the truck, the engine. Charger &amp; Challenger also have Hemi engines
@JoeYerdon Hemi works w a car parts theme given that I'm named after industrial transmission
@JoeYerdon there are a few reasons for that lol
@JoeYerdon my ex vetoed it. So we went w Hemi after the engine
@JoeYerdon I think he could've it pulled off 
@JoeYerdon I almost named him Ace the Bathound
I love the new collar &amp; leash. Looks so great with my dog's colours
@NigelCadbury he stops at the desk to see who's working. Keeps going when it's not them
Some of the guards in my building are so awesome. My dog knows when the ones who give treats are working
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na treathound 
Such an interesting life. Sent to Canada from Scotland in 1940 w a boat of other kids. Lived all over the world. Fascinating conversation :)
Shared a table for coffee w a lovely old woman. We have the same bday &amp; she'll be 87 :)
@antogold I hadn't had a cut since April :P she told me I can bring my dog in next time :) 
@antogold this better be the best haircut of my life. Everyone else who replied all recommended the same place
"...ummm, I put that shit on everything?"

@MrButterChicken @DuncanIdunno DYING
@searexx awwww <REVOLVING HEARTS>
Gisele &lt;3 I liked her &amp; Han together
Just killing time looking up the meaning of dreams... 

@theninjagreg I have my property taxes withdrawn with my mortgage
My parents have arrived in Stuttgart. I hope they get to Dancecentrum in time to see Kraftwerk.

Bartender: What'll ya have?
Cat: Shot of rum.

@AlsoNamedPhil @vcarneiro Never again. It's safe to say anyone who dates me will not be submitted to that
@vcarneiro I figured :) you know me -- I'm very agreeable
@vcarneiro @AlsoNamedPhil just realized that makes me sound extra bitchy. We had control issues. I'm actually chill &amp;very open to compromise
@ryantologist @schocker17 I really enjoyed Stranger than Fiction
@vcarneiro @AlsoNamedPhil no one controls me. I will do what I want
@vcarneiro @AlsoNamedPhil long story, but there were few mths when he didn't want me to have sweets. I hid chocolate in my closet
@AlsoNamedPhil done
@AlsoNamedPhil but an extremely evil version!
@AlsoNamedPhil well, you are my sidekick
@AlsoNamedPhil I can see a storyline w the latter where Old Phil becomes the Cheese Anarchist
@Peter_Lynn @theactivestick I thought it was just me!
@AlsoNamedPhil I like having 2 villains based on my ex -- Captain Buzzkill &amp; the Grocery Nazi
@AlsoNamedPhil will have to give it some thought
@AlsoNamedPhil that's right -- for our comic, Old Phil
@AlsoNamedPhil @ryantologist @theactivestick @mlse @bebek1ng maybe you are...
@bebek1ng sweet! You can see how much older I am (it's my bday). Also, @schocker17 will be in TO
@bebek1ng not sure if you're seen it tweeted past few wks -- if you're free Saturday night, come to wvrst
@DesaiDevang sounds good to me since @formerlyfrozen moved back there
@bebek1ng @AlsoNamedPhil @ryantologist @theactivestick @mlse 
@theactivestick hooking up with guys in their 20s
@AlsoNamedPhil @ryantologist @theactivestick @mlse @bebek1ng Phil, you're starting to make ppl our age sound old &amp; bitter
@dorkkly maybe... I try to keep him guessing by surprise timbits
@ryantologist @theactivestick @mlse @bebek1ng you guys are all so young
Do you think my dog realizes that days he gets a timbit are usually days he also gets a bath?
@clrkaitken as long as everyone is healthy &amp; happy :)
@clrkaitken congrats!
@Spookylish looks like such a sweetheart!
@JGoldsbie @dustinparkes @SeanKeay @DesaiDevang the Canadian link 
@Spookylish he's very distinguished with the grey beard :)
I have no doubt that the dog cleaned up all the food he didn't catch off the ground. The least he could do
Watching Looney Tunes &amp; apparently Speedy Gonzales goes steady with everybody's sister #player
So handsome at 8yrs old #NationalPuppyDay 
#NationalPuppyDay my dog 3 days after I picked him out (3.5wks); the day he came home (2mths), &amp; at 3mths 
I knew I liked the pattern for a reason, but wow
Just realized that 1 of the new collars I bought for my dog matches my underwear from @scifeyecandy 
Puppy day? What about dogs with grey beards day? 
@dlbno I don't have the app &amp; the stream is over whenever I click it
@AlsoNamedPhil @ErikBlevins just yours ;)
@ErikBlevins @AlsoNamedPhil did you ever get that pizza backpack? It would hold so many!
@AlsoNamedPhil @ErikBlevins area code
@ErikBlevins I was just so happy to hear you're not the only one who has a fanny pack full of condoms
@dlbno it's all good. I consider being an asshole a prerequisite for being my friend
@ErikBlevins “@TFLN: #TFLN 
@Briligerent it doesn't sound familiar at all lol
@antogold I think it looks good. You know what adjustments to make for next time
@ErikBlevins thanks. I like knowing who is also going to be on blood thinner for life.
LRT was the cause for the blood clots ever released? I'm curious if genetic disorder or trauma
Vin Diesel is why I ever go on Facebook
@schocker17 yup, blue. It's just light reflection, but I thought it looked really cool
@Leafer1984 he could be annoying, but it did fit w the ensemble
@NigelCadbury they're actually blue. They don't normally change colour based on what I'm wearing
@schocker17 I was wondering why ppl thought I was wearing contacts lol
I loved NewsRadio. Such a fantastic show
That's sick
Is it just me or does my eye look purple? 

WINTER: Not YET.
S: OK can I at least-
W: YOU DO NOT TOUCH BOSTON.
S: Man what did Boston DO to you?
W: (whi…
I imagine I'll get bored in an hr &amp; have to go out &amp; do something
I think I'm going to recline on a couch &amp; do nothing today. So exhausted from the wknd
@phylliskessel13 there are so many things wrong in that pic
@inaneenglish you'll get everything done -- always last minute cosplay crunch :)
@phylliskessel13 that hair! Lolol
@AlsoNamedPhil publish or perish! I'd have to look at my cv to see how many I have. I honestly can't remember. I want to say 6
@AlsoNamedPhil I've been wanting to check your pub med citations lol I can't remember if my book chapter shows up there or just google
@AlsoNamedPhil :(
My dog likes yogurt, but he does not have the dexterity or the height to open the fridge door
I going to go w a change in pressure forced it to pop off lol
When I opened my fridge, I noticed the lid from the yogurt was off &amp; placed perfectly on the container next to it. Should I be concerned?
@theactivestick damn gurl
He keeps poking my arm whenever I stop petting him 
@justsherryj I need to plan one more for FanExpo. I have 3 in mind already. Also thinking about anime north &amp; I have ideas for that
@bebek1ng so cool -- my pvr is set, so I'll watch it later. Tennis first
@justsherryj I saw 2 little boys in Batman tshirts on Superman's shoulder high-fiving over his head. I just missed getting a pic
@justsherryj I didn't see that! So many excellent cosplays this wknd
A middle-aged woman in the elevator at my building was curious if my wig was my real hair. Apparently the colour really suits me :)

@ArticleOne1979 glad you appreciate it :)
@Peter_Lynn 

.@error404theshow 


Glad I quickly snapped this 
Vader's chest plate just fell off lol
@vcarneiro Circe from Wonder Woman Vol 3 -- just posted it
Quick shot of the print -- I get the digital copy tmrw :)
Thanks Altovenue for the awesome green screen pic! #latexphotobooth 

@vcarneiro nope. I had a pic done in front of green screen -- will take a pic of the print when I pick it up

@schocker17 thanks :) it's all about the details
@schocker17 it's actually an old costume -- here's a pic comparing it to source 
@schocker17 Circe from Wonder Woman Vol 3
“@schocker17: @DALee74 maybe it’s because you’re still wearing your costume” The corset only attracts man-children
Fuck it. I'm going to comic con for the rest of the afternoon
I'm not sure why little kids seem to follow me during public skates, but practicing backwards crossovers was like an obstacle course
@fergus30 @JaredOfLondon dogs are great :) I miss having both a cat &amp; a dog
@jomsie I require more. I may just stay in bed &amp; see if I fall asleep again
@Leafer1984 well, you drive to work &amp; have a baby. Enjoy it when you can lol
@DarrelGOP wow, that's cool! I just thought she looked amazing.
Why am I awake so early? I shouldn't be up for another few hrs
@bookofloob @ryantologist @the_Zubes same, but b/c it was played constantly when it was 1st released, I actually remember a lot of it
@chrisjlund maybe they're waiting for the end of the night. Like the best slow song at the end of middle school dances
I really need to have watched more Dr Who for the crowd that is here
@the_Zubes this made me think of you “@TFLN: (617): I'd cum everywhere if I could have chicken nuggets right now”
@NigelCadbury Circe from Wonder Woman Vol 3
@the_Zubes @chrisjlund I can't look at a watch w/out hearing that song. I'm undecided if I should hug or strangle you guys
@DarrelGOP I actually don't know
I am not out at the bar in cosplay. I've done it before, but not tonight :P
In the perfect seat in this bar to watch Leafs/Sens &amp; Arsenal replay
@Peter_Lynn yeah, mine too

@justsherryj @scifeyecandy it's so much more fun if you do!
@justsherryj try to stop by @scifeyecandy booth tmrw - her stuff is incredible. If you look at my IG, she made She-Hulk, WW &amp; all my bikinis


@justsherryj it's so fun. I get a free day w my FanExpo pass, so I figured today would have a good turnout
