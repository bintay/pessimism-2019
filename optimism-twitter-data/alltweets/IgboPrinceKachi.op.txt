@M0NSTERAva yea, America probably won't be around in 100 years sadly
@honeycoquette yep. It's a good read so far
@honeycoquette I don't think she is. Or she at least isn't Sakura daughter
@BougieLa very very true
@rodimusprime Winter Soldier was just a good action movie in general. And you're right, I don't even wanna see Chris do any other roles
Now that I remember, I wore a lot of suspenders when I was a jit. Got it from my dad, cuz that's legit all he wore
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> thanks RT @_FreeJewel: Yall don't see young Kachi the gawd. Adorable <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

At all lol RT @iAmQueenRo: Happy Mother's Day to Bulma... she wasn't taking no mess from her husband either...
Deadpool is gonna be so damn good
I don't condone anybody in here threaten to kill, rape, or mutilate anybody. The fuck kinda shit is that (reference to my last RT)

please be aware that he is threatening, violent, &amp; abusive.
People are stupid RT @iAmQueenRo: wow niggas really be on here threatening ppl... like wow.
@MissPouncy they'll mature eventually
@MissPouncy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.  Don't act like you don't have a waiting list for marriage
@MissPouncy lol why not?
@Nigerianscamsss Wheelchair Jimmy. Snapping
@MissPouncy aye!
@MissPouncy meanwhile, you might be a full mother 5 years from now
@NisforNneka do what feels right to you. Not necessarily because you "have" to
Playing Sweet Mother for my mom when she gets back in the house. That's gonna be our dance at my wedding too
Classic!! RT @Nigerianscamsss: HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY! Prince Nico Mbarga- Sweet Mother 
@NisforNneka I had another follower day they same thing. He got ask about his mother on a date. Forgot all about the day
Single fathers, yes they are out there, your day isn't today. Fathers' Day soon come.
Happy Mothers' Day to my mommy, my deceased grandma, and all the women who are mothers.
@iAmQueenRo 
Just keep showing how we collectively aren't here for BW. Shit kinda irritates me...
Seen some RTs about this white dude made a stupid joke about black women. Then black men defended him when women told him about himself <NEUTRAL FACE>
Yea I fucked that up. I gotta pay more attention smh <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Swag RT @Missz_Jay: Wow RT @planettequila: Yes. 
@DRIbauchery <EYES>
Need a filthy woman in the bedroom. It's only right <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@__PettyBetty_ why not shoot yours lol
Mother's Day is today. Do I have to go to church then? I legit just thought about it...
@iAmQueenRo 
This how yall do? @iAmQueenRo  
@iAmQueenRo oh I know fully well about them. You better play the other 2 as well
@iAmQueenRo you going in like @britneyspears is in your room right now lol
@sarrahsaysso speaking that gospel. Shit sucks
@Aloha_Onuoha Nigerians love to brag lol
@PinguinoBesos I just turned to it...Headline Cops Lives Dont Matter to the Media...
My parents love spending money for spending money sake. I like nice things but a bag for $340?!?!
3 hours for Shondaland
Hate clothing with brands all on it. I'm not a billboard and most of it, the quality doesn't even warrant the price
It has MK all on the show and shit is like $200+
Sister just said "What's the point of buying name brand if you can't let people know" in reference to expensive ass MK tennis shows
Eat then watch Scandal and American Crime that I missed on Thursday. Probably catch up on other shows as well
I can understand people wanting people at comparable levels as them tho. But sometimes don't get beside yourself
Cuz if I had that "she outta my league" mindset, I wouldn't be working on something now. She knows my plans and She's cool with them
I don't believe fully in that league stuff. I have a plan of where I see myself and I'm working towards that. People want at least that
@fabuLaja she's happy. Idk what he does now tho
@NaijaNupe_ @theAfroLegalise the highest disrespect
@theAfroLegalise oh ok. You good then. My mom says that's a cuss
@fabuLaja the potential conversation lol
@theAfroLegalise you trying to kill her lol
Just date whoever you are attracted to, and has the qualities you are looking for and has something to offer you and you them
@liberated_lez @fabuLaja I agree. But some hear that or anything and cut it short.
amazing
@liberated_lez @fabuLaja both. Not that big a jump
@CarmillaLusta @fabuLaja true
@fabuLaja I mean I can see why she might do that. I'm a guy, society expects me to be the breadwinner, so idk if dating down exists for me
@theAfroLegalise same
@fabuLaja idk many women who would date down like that. Once she finds out he's a barber, she cut that off quick
@fabuLaja Yea. Not being attracted =/= being outta someones league. Most of us have degrees and middle class, we all same league
@Mona_Love7 Lol been since, I'd say 2008-09. I forget
@NaijaNupe_ lol I honestly haven't had a problem with it. I just put it out there cuz it's a thing
And you could still try. Messed with some 5'10" women before so it's all just about assessing and going for it
@liberated_lez yea, I'd have to figure that out lol. I'm good on that for now tho
But doesn't mean you don't try when it logically makes sense.
I'm agnostic, thats a cut. Hell I'm black, thats a cut. That's life
I've already accepted the women who may be outta my league because of shit I can't help. I'm short, thats a cut.
@JAYcobsLadder lol what I do
@SassyE oh ok.
@SassyE Native up and downs?
@SassyE basically just put em on like hats lol
@SassyE damn, that sucks
@SassyE your mom can't teach you? Give her like 2 days
@SassyE youtube
Just come with your best and shoot your shot. I'll be surprised.
Anyway, where bae at <EYES>?
I've pulled a few I was like how the fuck did I do that lol. I'm just blessed in that department I guess
Outta my league? I guess my league is a lot bigger than before. The most she could do is reject you, so why not try
She has her own life to deal with, he own health. She doesn't wanna hear it tho
She doesn't know how to stop rehearsing shit. She's telling everybody about what happened personally and beating herself up about it
My mom is on the phone downstairs. I'm in my room upstairs with door closed. I can clearly hear everything she's saying <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
To Pimp a Butterfly loud as fuck while moving my sister outta UGA <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@__PettyBetty_ free protein
Ratchet!!! RT @GAFollowers: Only at FVSU do they play Juvenile, “Back That A** Up” at the graduation ceremony. 
@BougieLa lol that's mean
Go ask her RT @BougieLa: Although there is an intern at work who's butt has the perfect amount of jiggle. I low key want to bite it.
@Nigerianscamsss <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ShonBoo lol true. Turning red and shit
@Nigerianscamsss I'm swagging man
Outside in this moderate sun and the white people burning lol.
@CMunoz1895 same. We just looking from two different angles
@CMunoz1895 the sound is different in terms of hip hop. That's what first grabbed me, first song in
@CMunoz1895 Kendrick's production and relevance puts it over Lupe for me.
That boy was going in lol. Still funny  
@CarmillaLusta I can only imagine
@CarmillaLusta how you have hair stuck on the walls and shitting in the showers?! Pads everywhere.
@CarmillaLusta I used to hear stories and see picks of McGuinn, Diamond, Truth, Wheatly dorms. Shit is pitiful
@apotheosist_151 maybe I just disagree
@apotheosist_151 it's none. That dude stupid.
@NaijaNupe_ lol be telling your bruhs don't wear that shit
Halle Berry took her role for granted. She was a horrible Storm
I can listen to Smuckers all day
Nobody is a functioning hard drug addict and lives a fool life. Addiction is real smh
No 
@CarmillaLusta this is true. Christopher Columbus game immaculate
And that's weird because yoga didn't start with white people
@NaijaNupe_ @Nigerianscamsss I guess now I know
I keep some neckties and bowties on deck. Depends on my mood.
@NaijaNupe_ @Nigerianscamsss you don't like em either?
@SassyE idk. No reason really. But I be looking at natural hair blogs for my beard
@Nigerianscamsss nigga I'm legit laughing right now
@apotheosist_151 moreso curiosity
@SassyE that's what I do. I just wish there were more mens blogs on them. But honestly, men don't blog about a lot of stuff
Anyway, enough of that, I'm wearing a bowtie today. Haven't in a while. I know @Nigerianscamsss would disapprove
@apotheosist_151 why not? Lol idk
Plus it's interesting to me. It's a nice skill to have.
I try not to speak from a place of ignorance on anything. I think I could know some about makeup and be a heterosexual man
Meanwhile women are the GOAT when it comes to skin/hair care. Niggas don't be caring as much, I want nice skin too
@Pharaoh_B28 lol
@pamnonga I know. My bad
@theAfroLegalise <UNAMUSED FACE>
@pamnonga lol yours look good
Learning how to do makeup, women gotta damn near go to a class and know color theory
@NaijaRoyale I see
@fabuLaja true, that's what people adding the most
Calm that brow pencil and concealer down lol
The only thing that be bothering me is when some take pictures and look pasty as fuck. Oh and large ass glowing eyebrows
@NaijaRoyale you an expert then lol
@SassyE fair enough.
@coffeeeblack lol let's say you are on time
@NaijaRoyale and how long that takes?
@iAmQueenRo so what you been feeling this week?
@miAmorShakira I mean the whole everything.
@SassyE this is true. Yet not easy. And some are ignorant to it actually being an issue or not


Ladies, what consists of your everyday face?
Black don't crack, my nigga!
@SassyE upbringing fucks that up heavy
@NisforNneka lol oh. Allergies suck
@fabuLaja so what you wear everyday?
@shegottawriteit naw it's an everyday face. Shouldn't be looking like you going to an upscale fashion show
Gotta worry about skin type, skin color, undertones, correction, precision, makeup color, occasion, blending, outfit, etc
Men, yall wanna be amazing and understand women getting "beat?" Watch a couple makeup tutorials. Shit intricate as fuck but intriguing
@SassyE Like I can't even imagine how that would be
@NisforNneka So you wear none at all most days, no lip, nothing?
@_FreeJewel lol I'm seeing 3,2,1 and 2,3,1
I remember I used to be "Why women where makeup." But now, I think an everyday face is optimal for most. Women like it, gives confidence etc
@NisforNneka that's fine. Some don't do a no makeup face outside the house
@_FreeJewel whichever way doesn't get me killed is the right answer lol
Some women everyday face be the complete most. But what do I know, I'm a man
I think you have a everyday face, then you have a going out face (depends on the occasion, theme, time of day), then a no makeup face
Goodness, why yall put that pick with the three cars on the TL?!
Lol yea we be doing this  
Tax day coming, tax day coming, tax day coming, TAX DAY COMINGGGG!
Everybody should listen to this hot <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE> RT @LupeFiasco: Mural 
Student loans too damn high, health care too damn high, can't save, we all in debt. Nigga!!!
We don't get enough vacation time, living wages for the average American sucks, no paid and/or adequate maternal AND paternal leave...
Murals, however, is the best freestylish rap I've heard in years. Make you wanna throw up, shit so fye
I still need to take my time, analyzing Tetsuo tho
@fabuLaja 12 rounds, 2min, lets goooooooo!!
@fabuLaja naw. Good album tho.
Must not have heard To Pimp a Butterfly  
For America to be so "great" it's still pretty shitty. Job &gt; our lives
@KingOfThisHill fraternal twins. Eggs getting fertilized by two different sperm cells. Super rare
@IAmBumblebee I never understood people saying you gotta suffer when it comes to love. I'll just be single
@CarmillaLusta somebody tweeted it and I immediately thought of you
@CarmillaLusta 
I wonder if @CarmillaLusta seen this gif of Hemsworth. I know she would love it lol

@iAmQueenRo exactly. I'm waiting on more info myself
@TayoMarciano true. I'm over that. I don't know so I don't worry about it
@TayoMarciano yea. If you need it, fine. But at this point in my life, I dont and many others don't either. If people could just get that
@TayoMarciano what am I gonna do with my kids, etc. I just said I'll raise them right, to be good people. Don't need religion for that
@TayoMarciano was talking with somebody the other day about being Agnostic. She was saying I have to believe in something
@Matt7B6 yea man. On to the next thing
@Matt7B6 congrats man. Long time coming
I didn't really need an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D spinoff. I have the actual series, Agent Carter, AKA Jessica Jones, Daredevil. I'm good
@KD11TR3 but it's been a couple days. I don't even need it to have black on it. Long as it's yellow, I'm good
@KD11TR3 I should have ugh. And congrats on the graduation.
This plantain better be some kinda ripe downstairs or Imma feel some type of way

@stunnatiff go watch it. It's a good movie
@iAmQueenRo @__glitterDICK <PERSEVERING FACE>
Shout out to my sister Chinnaya Ijeoma Ukpabi at her Rite of Sankofa Graduation Celebration #UGA15 
No space at all in this event tchwww.
@BougieLa waiting for that review...
@LastCharmander @iAmQueenRo I don't think it'll go fully like the comics. I doubt he'll give up his identity.
@iAmQueenRo @LastCharmander we'll see.
@iAmQueenRo @LastCharmander lol ma'am
@iAmQueenRo @LastCharmander it will be. This is his intro. He'll already be Spider-Man but he has a solo movie in 2017
@LastCharmander @iAmQueenRo yep. Spider-Man more than likely get a small cameo and Sony and Marvel have a deal to use him
@LastCharmander @iAmQueenRo still casting him. And Fantastic Four and X-Men are a different studio.
@iAmQueenRo it's cool. I'll ask you how you liked it
@iAmQueenRo I can't wait. I saw that earlier. Like I'm tingling inside lol
@brucewayne100 @DRIbauchery lol good
@brucewayne100 @DRIbauchery smh lol
Newest volume of Hulk has been really good as well
@insanityreport Marvel does group ensembles very well. So I have no worries at all
Putting Ant-Man in Civil War is gonna push people to see Ant-Man. And that's good
Where the hell they found William Hurt to come back as General Ross?!
@ThoseNerds Sounds bigger than AoU. I'm super pumped yet salty my car got fucked. I coulda been a Wakandan extra (Nigerian American)
@_JustAGee yep
Ant-Man gone be in Civil War?! That movie gone be bigger than Avengers AoU! I'm ready!
@_JustAGee I'm never watched it.
@_JustAGee it's just Dragonball in HD and some of the fluff taken out
@ATadBitAwky hmm. Enough time to possibly get my life together
@ATadBitAwky when and where the next convention
@SimplyAmazing68 that's what I was talking about
@SimplyAmazing68 you're married?
@ATadBitAwky ma'am lmao
@Hudss__ yea. Get the blogs going
@Hudss__ makes sense. He coulda kept that to himself tho
@fabuLaja that's unfortunate
Chris Brown didn't have to take a picture of her and put on IG tho...
@3BlackGeeks meanwhile Secret Wars gonna be epic as fuck it seems.
@3BlackGeeks but I don't connect with those old versions. Didn't read any DC until Flashpoint and don't care to read anything before
@3BlackGeeks they say they did it for the move. Have random writers do random stories.
@3BlackGeeks Convergence comes off as Earth 2 event with only connection to Earth 0 being Superman showing up real fast after Brainiac arc
@fabuLaja gotta wake him up with some he *drops phone*
@iAmQueenRo just seeing this. Hate having no notifs. But thats good for the healthy one
@M0NSTERAva we all hope for our closest circles to be like that
@M0NSTERAva or can offer that themselves
@brucewayne100 @DRIbauchery lmao
@M0NSTERAva that's very true. That's a good way to be with loved ones
Who actually found their spouse in college tho?
@M0NSTERAva that's enough the whatever amount you used
@M0NSTERAva I can fuck with this. Hope you succeed
@kerrybtone lol all that
@DRIbauchery I heard about myself too. Mad I didn't get who they said I did
@In_DMCs_head damn, I'm no where near that. Probably will never get there either
@M0NSTERAva so now I'm curious, what do you want?
@DRIbauchery yea I remember hearing about you until I actually met you
<EYES> RT @iAmQueenRo: me 87% of the time. 
@M0NSTERAva yea. He will soon come if he hasn't already
@DRIbauchery lol couldn't? I remember freshmen sisters having that rule. I remember it not working either
@In_DMCs_head what do you classify as high?
@M0NSTERAva and that if they stay, it's because they like you
@DRIbauchery your first mistake is having a boo freshmen year lol
@MrsLadyJai this is true. I didn't do many one night stands either.
@LastCharmander man, you get a car, God gives you the juice instantly.
@M0NSTERAva yea. Gotta be selfish first.
@blakjordanbreen you know what, that makes a lot of sense thinking about it
I'm amazed at the ass whoopin you got coming. X
@M0NSTERAva the key is has it helped
@MrsLadyJai no sex til 19. And I'm not at 40 yet lol
At FAMU, if you were in a frat, Marching 100, or dance troupe, high body counts were standard almost lol
@M0NSTERAva I can agree with that. You do the sexual life you can handle cuz you want at least a friend
@blakjordanbreen that's the worst
Average college student 10 semesters, 5 years. Easily 10 guys. Not even trying.
Let's go for a "good girl" not a "hoe." (Disclaimer, no such thing as a hoe). She had 2 boyfriends per semester AND waits to have sex
It's funny people say "how can s/he fuck that many people" while in college.... That shit isn't hard, at all
@M0NSTERAva that's overall good. Others aren't fortunate
@CarmillaLusta Lmao.
Dodging holy water RT @CarmillaLusta: Y'all talking sex and body count before 9am? ∗sprays holy water on timeline∗
@M0NSTERAva <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@blakjordanbreen true, I try to tell em
Here here <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> RT @iAmQueenRo: i am determined NOT to be annoyed as all the fucks today...
@blakjordanbreen true. I'm content with my track record. And still no kids or diseases
@Smooth_Orator wake up, dick on the floor
@Smooth_Orator exactly. She was so pissed at him the whole ride to get dorm. Told him, glad you didn't fuck.
@M0NSTERAva lol
@Smooth_Orator  had a friend was gonna fuck this freshmen, he pulled out a condom, she got offended. I had to take her home
@M0NSTERAva Lmao. I went to FAMU. So other than FSU across the railroad tracks, few legit interactions with white people
@Henny_Hardaway I'm like how? And it be regular niggas. No letters, no sports, just school
@M0NSTERAva no white boos?
In college I didn't wear shirts in my place. Just boxer briefs or shorts.
Since being in parents house, I'm a t shirt, boxer brief guy. What I wear around the house. I get the mail, take out trash in that too
Smh RT @insanityreport: Dudes be like "I was getting 10 women a week" in college then at the the time "yeah I don't use condoms". Holy hell
@M0NSTERAva lol. Get you some curtains
@M0NSTERAva or let that nakedness shine thru
@MissPouncy that and others, Food Inc, etc (having a brain fart)
I know niggas really had 100+. I knew some women with "high" body counts as well.
I had a nice sex life in college. I didn't have as many partners as other guys cuz I had casual sex partners for years
@Smooth_Orator daaaammmmmnnnnnn
@MissPouncy yep. Why low fat is bullshit and sugar and fake food is killing us as a people
@MissPouncy it shouldn't be this hard to "eat healthy" but here we are
@MissPouncy and nutrition in America isn't the best anyway. Just want money.
@MissPouncy and that's how these studies may get you.
@MissPouncy I mean for the average person. The average person doesn't read.
@MissPouncy lol at went into debt. I remember you telling me before
@MissPouncy true. They aren't easy to read and interpret either
I'll say wear condoms my nigga and support your kids. They should happen regardless
Child support topic? NOAP! Leaving that alone
@LucyFruitie got my Doctor of Pharmacy, not getting anything else lol. One and done
@MissPouncy or just show correlation, not causation. But I can read that and find out at least instead on blindly throwing info
@MissPouncy I agree with that too. I look moreso for the ones that actually site studies. Remember a lot of studies in general are bias
@MissPouncy I like the logical premise of some people who push it. And realizing is not one size fit all. Some can handle certain things
@MissPouncy I'm still reading and learning myself. I have no problem with beans.
@MissPouncy the sites I frequent, they eat beans, don't mind cheese/dairy, etc
@MissPouncy I think it's something with not necessarily being about to absorb all the nutrients. But that's why people soak them for hours
@MissPouncy yea that's what I'm about. Nutrient dense foods, not to processed.
@MissPouncy you really want your beans huh lol
@MissPouncy they don't nuts, I agree with beans, and the amount of wheat we eat, which has the gluten, isn't necessary
@MissPouncy that's people in general. Gotta read and research whatever you do to yourself. At least I do
1) Doctor 
2) Lawyer
3) Engineer
4) Disgrace to the family
@iAmQueenRo RT @CGBPosts: Plot twist: Rihanna is every Mario character 
@MissPouncy I feel what you mean tho. Cause some sound like how the vegans sound lol
@MissPouncy well I'll say I'd go Paleo/real food. Like I'd modify mine.
@MissPouncy yea I can agree with that. I think it's a good template them modify if for your body
@MissPouncy I agree at least with lowering wheat based carbs and sugar. Eating more fat, better grown meat, and veggies
@MissPouncy some cut because some people can't tolerate. But many soak them as well
@MissPouncy I wouldn't necessarily go as strict as that. Some cut, some don't.
@MissPouncy lol why. I agree with some of the principles.
@Missz_Jay hurting niggas feelings
@NisforNneka no prob. Now you know
I admire those who write blogs. Cuz you gotta be good with getting your words out and make sense
@Doctor_Trent cool. I'll open a tab and read thru tomorrow
@NisforNneka lol I already look into your posts whenever you talk about it on here. You write good shit
@Doctor_Trent oh yea? I'll keep a look out for when you post
@Missz_Jay why you so rude lol
But I need some on health, paleo/natural living, relationships, adult shit, money, etc
Need more blogs written by black people, especially black men. Have my black podcasts but with nerd shit and whatnot
Find Your Wings is so soothing
@SincerelyDedra good

@HashtagSabrina exactly, tho I like scotch
@HashtagSabrina other than saying weed is bad blindly
@HashtagSabrina Oh, well they got the ball moving I guess
@travislroberts I'm talking in general
@travislroberts Lol I'm saying because somebody on here is doing like her version of Tinder on here, she calls it Twinder.

@TeriAmour only reason I could use to differentiate
@travislroberts lol oh you on Twitter now? And sure why not
@NisforNneka yep, it's too easy not too
@TeriAmour I'd guess you aren't a BBW to somebody if they don't find you attractive
Yall better use Twitter to get you a boo/bae

Cuz what happened with this final Incursion, damnnnn
They gave Hickman full fucking reigns with being the architech of Marvel since I'd say 2012, Marvel.NOW
@dpalm66 take some time...it's ok. It took me by surprise too lol.
@dpalm66 Hickman said everything ends...and he was right lol
I loved it. He just went all the way there RT @dpalm66: Oh my god Hickman...Secret Wars 1. No fucking around at all.
Finally RT @ComplexMag: Khloe Kardashian confirms that Kylie Jenner's lips are fake: 
@DannyMac___ lol what happen? Just the beginning of this Marvel comic summer event
Just read Secret Wars issue 1...WOW!!!!!
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen me too. But I think they prepping that one black kid from Zero Year to be a Robin in We are Robin book in June
@liberated_lez that's sad cause I think she's attractive. And they had do much chemistry at first
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII that too. The only thing is how rich he is
@honey_of_life oh ok.
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen if there was no Miles, I'd draft Peter Parker. Grew up in Queens, no parents? Easily black lol
@liberated_lez go head, I'm curious
@liberated_lez he's just anxious about change. And I'm surprised they haven't had sex yet
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen lmao.
@honey_of_life that's generous?
@iAmQueenRo damn. Don't die oh
@liberated_lez it's really small petty stuff messing them up. The guy is a nurse, I'd hope he's apply to other positions. Easier for him
@liberated_lez he gotta leave mom alone. He's 28, he's married. It's ok lol. They are definitely gonna stay together it seems tho
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen yea. Everybody wont react the same and people overall hate big changes.
@liberated_lez an hour away. Nigga have your niece teach mom to use skype or facetime. See them every/every other weekend
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen me too.
@liberated_lez I'm most surprised by that couple. Took forever for her to be interested, took forever to have sex, now they nasty lol
@liberated_lez she turned around now he wanna be homesick. He need to suck that shit up. If he does, they'll be good.
@liberated_lez well we'll see what happens
@iAmQueenRo lol they going on and on. I'm bout to exit myself.
@liberated_lez and him blowing up came outta nowhere
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen I just try not to jump to conclusions, but I pay attention. Those who are out themselves, especially on internet
@liberated_lez see. And he was saying Jess should know why he's mad. She doesn't know him to know why
@iAmQueenRo me too. When comics were made, it was all white. That was the way it was. So I'm glad for inclusion.
@liberated_lez yea. He needs to remember that those times are long and gone
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII It's useless to complain in my opinion before you read the stories
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII cuz what happens after that is you say how that doesn't sound right then they double down.
@liberated_lez lowkey looks abusive.
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII I sit back and wait for the reasoning. All you gotta do, they did that hole for themselves
@iAmQueenRo @MTFIII @blakjordanbreen lol we talkinga about comics
@iAmQueenRo understandable
@MTFIII @blakjordanbreen agreed.
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII it seems the average comic nerd doesn't know how to wait and read the story lol
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII I frequent comicvine and comicbookresources. In the latters forums, most were made just because of the change
@CarmillaLusta oh, that's easy. Stuff I keep up with is well past that. I'll get to it eventually
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII Oh I get what you mean
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII meanwhile the originals are still around doing their thing
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII cuz I'm liking what they are doing with Black Cap and Female Thor.
@CarmillaLusta so there's a manga. Good I'll read that then.
@blakjordanbreen @MTFIII I think what matters in the end of the day is comics need more diversity and as long as the story is good, I'm good
@CarmillaLusta never watched Hellsing but you love it. Might have to put it on my backlog
@iAmQueenRo so he lasts more than 2 years, it's a record in your book
TL talking about DBZ and comics. I love it
@liberated_lez Ryan from #MarriedAtFirstSight needs to calm all the way down. It's funny the men were acting somehow this episode
How long yall with a man before yall fed up he aint propose?
@Ljay90 lol that's what I said. I wouldn't call it trash tho. He gotta remember when it came out. It didn't need to do much at the time
@CarmillaLusta quietly most don't even know that
@CarmillaLusta yea that's what I was saying. It's like the archetype for modern shounen. It was lovely for it's time
It's a slew of anime/manga I gotta catch up and watch. The good ones I mean
@CarmillaLusta Just looked up Momocon. That's right up my ally and it's after my birthday
@CarmillaLusta hmm, I might try and slide to AWA then
@CarmillaLusta no car ugh. When are those tho?
Preferably New York Comic Con. I'd have a place to stay, and it's cheaper/closer
I'm putting it into existence, I'm going to at least 1 comic con next year. I have more than a year to set that up.
@CarmillaLusta lol your love for Chris Hemsworth/Thor

Me: "but we're having a family meal at my house"

Bae: "I'm horny" 
That was a good analysis/rant on Dragonball. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

-Your garbage must look exciting.
And that's fine lol
@ATadBitAwky yep, be like "Damn can Goku get to the end of Snake Way already?!"
Exactly. Growing up, that storyline is <FIRE>. Watch it now, you'll be mad that Frieza fight took forever many episodes lol.
@iAmQueenRo YuYu is at least comparable if not better than DB
@iAmQueenRo lol you agree with me?
One day I need to rewatch Dragon Ball Kai for nostalgia purposes. But yea, it's grossly overrated as a shounen anime
Nen/reitsui/haki/spirit power/alchemy/chakra all better explained and better systems than the kai/power level system of DB
Hunter X Hunter (one of my faves) does EVERYTHING Dragonball does better. Better power system, multidimensional characters, better story
However, it's a plethora of anime/manga better than Dragonball
Doesn't mean I don't love it, good overall video games lately, the newer movies were good and I'll be watching the newer anime
The story took a decline after DB became DBZ. The story is just fights and shallow. The anime coulda easily been 50-100 episodes shorter
In hindsight, tho interesting, DB is an overly average anime at best and definitely overrated. But it's like the archetype of modern shounen
I read that DBZ complex article. Dragon Ball was one of the pioneers in my love for anime/manga. However...that article isnt' wrong
And the one where theirs a big Agumon.
Oh, 6 part movie series? That's interesting. I'll definitely be watching. I've seen most of the Digimon anime. Gotta finish Xros Wars
@iAmQueenRo lol naw
Ma'am lol RT @iAmQueenRo: y'know just reppin my set 
@NotEvenSmooth @iAmQueenRo lmao
@insanityreport and you're right about the black aspect. Let's see if we get this same outrage with Black Panther or Captain Marvel
@insanityreport the majority of them are Mr Fantastic reaches but I'm for the most part over it. I enjoyed the movie, thats fine for me
@fabuLaja they've probably had women who give horrible head. Cuz that makes no damn sense lol
@SophiaPetrillo_ shitty parents. Too many of them
@AtgPodcast oh, I'd never tell the whole world. Unless I was rich and able to protect myself.
Lol @rodimusprime reading this "Fuck the court" letter is hilarious. That woman was going all the way in
Secret Wars, Marvel's summer comic book event, starts today. 1st issue got a good review I see. I'm excited
@SophiaPetrillo_ well damn lmao
@AtgPodcast Like how Miles Morales is now. Ganke knows and his dad finally knows. Oh and the other black roommate.
@AtgPodcast I'd reveal to my family and only my closest friends. Significant other when it's serious
Slight headache
Not analyzing that video. Just think it was unnecessary
@iAmQueenRo gotta make that money
I'm lowkey excited for the last third of the year. I'm optimistic as fuck right now
@_FreeJewel get off here, go get some rest
@_FreeJewel you were talking about going to sleep like 2 hours ago lol
It's almost 2 and I'm still awake...
@NisforNneka lmao, I can't even help myself
@NisforNneka lol yes?

@liberated_lez you leaving Texas?
@sarrahsaysso I always randomly hearing about that.
Lmao
@liberated_lez oh no
@liberated_lez watching it now. It comes on again but I just recorded it so I can skip commercials
Ryan needs to calm down. Just tell her what happen and be calm.
Finally watching #MarriedAtFirstSight. Catch watch when it comes on because of Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D
Next week gone be <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
Reina saw this too. Skye mom aint shit
Least he didn't kill her
@TheDuragGeneral you sleep. That movie was amazing
@JAZ_MEAN at all
@JAZ_MEAN that would be hilarious
@JAZ_MEAN lmao idk what she's even gonna say on there. I haven't watched in forever
@JAZ_MEAN yep. At least one episode
@MrsLadyJai lol just saw the commercial
Oh Raven wanna be on Blackish huh?
Damn, Daisy going for the jugular #DatShield
Inhumans name drop!!!!! #DatShield
Welp, I see how this is gonna tie in!
Next week on the Flash gone be good
Black fatherhood moments brought to you by Joe West #DatFlash
@iAmQueenRo Lmao. The downfall or uplifting of men
This nigga lol. That pussy makes you do amazing things #DatFlash
Welp, that didnt work
@M0NSTERAva lol true
@CoachMW1 lol eventually. She gone talk about this for a while
@M0NSTERAva so the lying won't bother you? That's what's up lol
@M0NSTERAva how would you react?
Eobard ain't shit for telling Eddie that #DatFlash
Iris has a right to be mad but she gotta understand. #DatFlash
Joe crying and shit lol
She can't put that on him #DatFlash
@_FreeJewel I feel like that at times too
Damn, Iris mad at everybody now #DatFlash
@M0NSTERAva same thing I said
They don't lock doors in the place?! #DatFlash
SSSSSHHHHHIIIIIITTTTTTTT #TheFlash
Barry, she KNOWS. Catch on my nigga
Anyway, #TheFlash!!
I enjoyed the movie, really hating all the unnecessary backlash
@TeriAmour nothing new lol
She, along with Hawkeye and for now, the Hulk, don't need a solo movie (another for Hulk). We are getting Captain Marvel later, simmer down
ESPECIALLY the Black Widow nonsense that people are talking about. It wasn't sexist at all. She's always done good in these movies
Overall it's a good movie, a good comic book movie, good action movie. Most of these people, their opinions are stupid.
Could it have been better if Whedon got free reign he wanted, sure. Is it above criticism, no. But the criticism it's getting is nonsense
I'm really hating all this nonsense that's coming outta AoU and Whedon and the nonsense complaining.
@TeriAmour lol true. I fucks with her
@TeriAmour oh that's her. I know that face anywhere
@SassyE they need to let that go. I want a women who knows what she wants sexually and isn't uncomfortable talking about sex
@SassyE I don't understand the want in having a virgin. That lack of experience &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
@TeriAmour whaaaa?!?! Lol that's Skin Diamond
@MsAreolaBrown just tell them. Maybe they'll make it less stressful
@MsAreolaBrown why you aint go?
Lowkey, a 3-4 day weekend partying in Lagos sounds like a good 30th birthday. Who knows anything about that?
@MsAreolaBrown cause I wont have anything
@Nigerianscamsss @NisforNneka gonna say no in Igbo and pidgin to make sure they hear, pull my ear so they know to listen lol
@SassyE @NisforNneka lmao
Other than just to go as a Nigerian or to see my dad (controversial) I really have no reason for now to be going to Nigeria
@NisforNneka I'm going no time soon so I'm good lol.
@LucyFruitie @NisforNneka shit is stupid. But do wills actually hold weight there?
Whenever I finally go to Nigeria, the few family I have that I know bet not ask me for shit lol. I'm not above saying no
@LucyFruitie @NisforNneka I hear about that too many times. It's so damn common
It was best that she reported it instead of telling the police and letting them leak it like they tried to before
@In_DMCs_head lol yea. I wasn't sure of the title
They are really making a big fuss about commissioner not getting the heads up about the charges.
I remember my mom's cousin's kid was trying to get me to help him with something about money. Told him I didn't have it...because I didn't
Always  
@SophiaPetrillo_ you gotta be able to talk about sex not sexually. But that's understandable
@JDFLOYD @SophiaPetrillo_ lol
@SophiaPetrillo_ it shouldn't be for the most part
America isn't even in top 10?! I know that list is a lie lol
@iAmQueenRo exactly
Nigeria as a country holds sex so taboo, women enjoyment and indulgence of it is looked down on, sex talk is uncomfortable, etc
Lies RT @A1publicist: Nigeria Ranked No 1 As Most Sexually Satisfied Country In The World. - 
Lol the nudes talk on my TL.
@SassyE lol do that for future bae
Like get a professional to shoot some pics, then you shoot some amateur ones, put it in magazine form, wrap it and give to him.
@SassyE I just said this lol
That any women who did that for their men, I think that would be a fye ass V Day gift or random gift
Lowkey...I'd like a book of selfies/nudes from bae
@Missz_Jay go on craigslist
@TeriAmour wow. That's...genius lowkey. Niggas gonna buy it too
@TeriAmour it's legit a book of pics of her?
@iAmQueenRo #swagging
@TeriAmour I'm glad you are. Now you can attack the world
Damn, I just got creative as FUCK right now lol
Just thought about that Spider-Verse type sleeve I still want...
@JAZ_MEAN yep, never know
@JAZ_MEAN oh, just a mistake. And it's cool. You could honestly be done after this
@JAZ_MEAN Vu it's crazy you having twins

All they know is goto school &gt; graduate &gt; goto Dubai  &gt; get married the…
@iAmQueenRo it'll recharge my brain lol
@ToyosiOlo lol my apologies
@ToyosiOlo lmao. I knew she had more important things to do
Thinking about a nap then finish this study guide...can't focus right now and a nap would help
@ToyosiOlo she'll be back soon
@ToyosiOlo you know what, I forgot all about her
@iAmQueenRo oh damn...they gonna say how transgenders are a poison to black people again
@ToyosiOlo Yea, she getting ready to make Disney money with Star Wars
@damnBrittt that's stupid of them
@damnBrittt actually I'm reading it, that's not even the real headline. Just the tweet attached to it. Its about transgenders in general
@damnBrittt Really? I was just about to read. Then that's a stupid headline
@ItsLooon exactly.
i really hate that phrase. ______ is the new black. NO!!!
No! Black is the only black  
@NaijaNupe_ @JAYcobsLadder she must be taking me on it lol. I'm broke
@iAmQueenRo the guy didn't say, it was a tangent lol. But it's like am evaluation you'd have for anything else
@JAYcobsLadder @NaijaNupe_ I'll wait until you come back
She grades him on a 10 point scale quarterly in 4 categories so he can know how he's doing in their marriage. Interesting idea
Listening to this podcast about a lot of different stuff and it came up on a husband and wife and the wife grades him.
@NaijaNupe_ naw, that's a ways off. Goofs get licensed and what not first. It's my plan before the year is out, which is realistic
@_minimehh whenever you find one, let me know and I you
@_minimehh true. Gotta find a real good one. Tho I use the internet mostly, like it all in one resource
@sarrahsaysso tchwww rude lol
@Aloha_Onuoha oh cool
I wish there was a book I could buy about all the adult shit that somebody my age should know. Like finances, moving, job hunts, etc
@LustyLovah oh cool. Sounds like a plan.
@LustyLovah oh ok. And you stay in?
@LustyLovah in Pharmacy? Didn't know
@LustyLovah yea. Easiest path where I go
@LustyLovah transferring to Tx is just paying money after already having a license and then taking their respective law test, MPJE
@LustyLovah one of the reasons I'm not staying in GA. Gotta get an additional 1000+ intern hours...nope
@LustyLovah yea, why I'm transferring a license there. It's easier to get it in FL where I graduated. Just pay my money, they have my shit
Tom Hardy wanna be the Punisher...WELP!!!! Marvel better get on that
@LustyLovah it won't be till like August or September I'll be trying. Gotta get licensed first then licensed there, for Pharmacy
@NaijaNupe_ oh damn. I know they are always pharmacy jobs available. I just it doesn't take to long to get employed
@LustyLovah yep. I try and get honest opinions from people too
@Aloha_Onuoha when's that?
@LustyLovah Oh definitely. I'll try for the summer. I have time
@NaijaNupe_ job in what field?
@Nigerianscamsss just said the same thing
Was your hands, be mindful of touching beard, wash you beard regularly, it'll be clean. It's called proper hygiene
That study about the beards is stupid. It's basically saying beards have fecal matter because of improper hand washing. You touch her face
@NaijaNupe_ I'm going for Houston.
And I'll know some people there. I'm excited. Just gotta continue to plan according.
I think the move would be good. Nice city from what I hear. Good amount of young black professionals, Nigerians/Africans, and Carribeans
I mean it's crazy living in Cali (my stepdad lived there) and NY is so damn expensive. $2K for a 1BR...the fuck?!
@iAmQueenRo I meant Cali and NY, my fault
Talked to my parents about my plans of being in Houston, Texas by the end of the year. And just living in general.
That swag surf live as fuck!!
@ProfessorSlay Sprint has done me good. Especially with unlimited. But I like service in all buildings lol
@ProfessorSlay I hear it's getting better and overtaking Sprint. Imma look into it when I'm able before end of year
T-Mobile is on my top list for new carrier because of that unlimited streaming option. But I hear about sucky service outta cities
Rih vs Bey on the TL....naw I'm good
@MissPouncy lol I need to do that one day
@CarmillaLusta @fabuLaja oh shit, yall right about Fan Bingbing
@fabuLaja yea, Bieber. I saw somebody tweet that, that blazer was too fye, tho most of the men were clean
@fabuLaja Rih, Naomi, Kendall, Janelle, can't think of a 5th
Why they really brought this to the grand opening. Coulda brought this up later
@Mona_Love7 yep. She needs to only deal with them when she needs to
@keke2short upset lol
@fabuLaja easily the most expensive outfit of the night
Joseline didn't even really do anything and got Mimi worked up
Joc licking toes on national TV lmao
That lingerie she got on ugly tho
Akara mixture lmao <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I like Zandaya fit too
Mimi is stupid.
@iAmQueenRo I saw a hint of red in one picture
Aight, I'm fucking with that Rihanna dress. Go big or go home
Wow, Rihanna goes big. Imma wait for a clear pic
@fabuLaja shit looks horrible
The fuck wrong with Kris face?!
@ProfessorSlay yep still gotta pay that money. And 1mil...fuck!!
@ProfessorSlay I remember. But that's a lot of damn money
Ming-Na Wen Asian bae
Karlie breasts big as fuck
Old picture. From last year  
@Tiph_Seven oh, thanks
Is she stripping or singing...I'm confused
$45K in back child support. First off, fuck why is it that much?!?! Second off, nigga pay your kids money
@Tiph_Seven and she dealing with this child support nonsense
Wait, what is the Met Gala anyway?
@CarmillaLusta I'm pleading the fifth
Now, Kim shouldn't have worn that dress after Bey wore it. She knows she bout to get rode on
@iAmQueenRo maybe it's the color. Idk.
Nigga, it's rehab, he'll be good. Just some withdrawals lol
Like how Joc fucking these women and think they wont tell each other

joc don't learn, dawg.
These men stay leaving some good women for multiple pussy. Joc is a dumbass

"i want my family back together." 

THATS THE LINE
Ok, Bieber swagging the FUCK outta that blazer
@fabuLaja clean.
@_FreeJewel me neither lol
Cassie and Diddy look good together. Nice dress, swinging with the double breasted tux
@_Choccie I like it. Nice fit. Probably looks better live
Solange looks the fool
I like Emma Roberts. Simple but clean
@Tommy_TweetAlot like 90% of them
Janelle is forever 2nd bae
@iAmQueenRo when she first started her change, she looked ok...then she went to far left lol
The fit of D Wade tux...naw. Too much break in the pants.
Kerry Washington's dress...who the fuck picks them out
@iAmQueenRo Elizabeth Olsen. She's younger. She played Scarlet Witch in it
The Olsen twins got old looking fast. Meanwhile their sister was in AoU looking good.
@_FreeJewel whatever the Met Gala is lol. I'm just seeing the tweets
Damn I missed a good amount of this red carpet. I love those.
@fabuLaja true.
@fabuLaja or maybe everybody was always one but they aren't scared to be that now
@iAmQueenRo I gotta learn about deep conditioning my beard. Especially for when I grow it back
@fabuLaja lol vegans tho?
@fabuLaja or being a nerd was lame back then
If there's a video by the police, cool. I still don't believe them tho
Welp, CNN has the stream we all got now. Note the police said nobody say hurt.
But police on TV saying he wasn't shot?!
Wait, I just watched a video of them around the guy and everybody said he was shot. I think I saw the bullet hole in his back.
@iAmQueenRo maybe. That who video is stupid, its from the guy we all talking about lol
So black people just gonna make our own banks and military in america...yea that nigga is stupid
<EYES> RT @iAmQueenRo: is your plot thick bitch?

mine is...
Watching this nigga video. This dude is stupid. And of course he has no solutions with his complaining
@iAmQueenRo that's what I thought
Lol when all this "hotep" stuff come about and was it always bad?
@insanityreport why you tweet this lmao <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@ShonBoo said so in an article about him
That man is doing more than a lot of BM are doing for the black community. I support him wholeheartedly.
Deray is gay. There are gay men in this world. I don't see the problem. And effeminization of the black male? People actually think this?!
Shout out to my younger sister @_chinnaya for getting her degree and heading toward being a dentist!!
@_chinnaya send me a pic of it
@Britt_Alexa Wednesday is fine.
@Britt_Alexa go just do nothing. Take a week to chill. Then get on that NAPLEX studying. Don't be me lol
@LucyFruitie has to be smh
@CarmillaLusta then when the extremists ones clap back, they act surprised smh
Why the entire fuck is there a Mohammed drawing contest in America?!
@iAmQueenRo lol look at your TL...I missed a lot in this last hour
@3BlackGeeks I'm waiting for what she'll look like.
@Wandylicious26 yep he's far from that now.
@Wandylicious26 really? He stays talking nonsense and he's so disconnected to Black America.
@iAmQueenRo just rub it in why don't you lol
Random white woman running for GOP and fuck Ben Carson. FUCK BEN CARSON
@iAmQueenRo you make me wanna go listen later today
@iAmQueenRo this your first time listening to these albums?
This BW's reach on CNN is amazing. She's basically delusional to this
Yep, fuck this lady on CNN, @marclamonthill going in on her tho
Any black person who says race isn't an issue in #FreddieGrey case, like this BW on CNN, is stupid
@PinguinoBesos Better mute key words or just 86 the TL until they see it

For all the complainers. Shit looks good 
@Dare_Re_Ya smh
@Dare_Re_Ya ma'am, the day just started
Other than the movie being thick, which I didn't mind at all looking back, that movie was the perfect comic book movie. How can you not like
@insanityreport plus we are getting the better Captain Marvel soon
@insanityreport she got amazing development in Cap 2 and AoU. I don't think she needs a solo along with Hawkeye
Too much complaining about her honestly RT @insanityreport: “BW got reduced to a love interest” - did folks even watch the damn movie?
@Dare_Re_Ya yep, right onto rotations. I know that life lol. Tho my first was research with Thornton.
"Just go get a job" anybody annoying as fuck RT @Smooth_Orator: "just go get a job" twitter annoying as fuck.

@SassyE @NaijaNupe_ oh you aint say all that.
@SassyE let that ego go.
@ProfessorSlay hey hey, I don't pay attention to her money. I figured she had a lot

Does Phaedra win cases tho?
Shittttt
Donald Trump sent the check I'm seeing, never mind then lol
Welp, I didn't know. Nevermind RT @ProfessorSlay: @IgboPrinceKachi SHE didn't send it, Donald Trump did

Offer to give check but didn't smh
@ShonBoo nudes are always safe with me lol.
@3BlackGeeks shoulda been CG but I'm intrigued

@ItsJustPrince awww shit, congrats dude. Any jobs lined up?
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent yea it is. Or at least in the sense of everybody gets same test but different prep standards and quality
@Doctor_Trent I'm hoping for that one day
I had a follower who homeschooled her nephew because preschool/daycare was failing him. Learned faster under her than school
@Doctor_Trent yep. At least parents can do it in the household
@Doctor_Trent i wonder how that could be changed tho
@Doctor_Trent and I hate it. I think testing is important but shouldn't be the golden standard
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent you know what, you right about that
@kerrybtone I always know never read the comments
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent my school wasn't that shitty lol. I learned about Africa AND Columbus was that nigga. So half good
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent mine was pretty decent. But that was a decade plus ago lol
@kerrybtone thanks
@kerrybtone you think you can find it for me?
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent we got world history/social studies for that. Idk how it is now tho
And Imma blame the parents first. It starts with them in the household. Teach your kids some things as well. Get them early
We don't teach critical thinking in grade school. Then rush to teach in university.
@iAmQueenRo @Doctor_Trent very true. Calculus is important, but not for everybody lol. Those other things are
@Doctor_Trent exactly. That's schools going more so toward test taking and not learning life skills and skills for important shit
@kerrybtone yea unfortunately. The gap is too damn big tho. There's always gonna be a low and high class. But that difference...
If it was easier for poor people to climb out poverty in America. But it isn't. That's America's reality
@Zoe_Mega I mean, speak specifics
Sadly that's hard cause of how people think, and money.
Quietly, those things are kind of America's problems in general
Those things collectively would help those people. Of course they need to change their mindsets about things but that comes later
@Zoe_Mega you think so?
They need jobs. They need effective education. They need better, more nutrient dense food. Better lower priced homes.
I always think about how to help lower class people, especially lower class PoC
I want to thank the people of Baltimore for …
@__PettyBetty_ yep
@__PettyBetty_ then you gotta have patience lol
@__PettyBetty_ friends, social media, dating sites, etc
@__PettyBetty_ gotta put yourself out there and utilize your resources
@__PettyBetty_ tchwww whatever
Lowkey the woman I'm getting to know I followed cuz of her avi and the IG check lol
@__PettyBetty_ I actively thing about that for the future
@keke2short after that avi check
@__PettyBetty_ blame society and education of habits in boys
@keke2short shallow ass lol
@iAmQueenRo like that Dave Chappell skit "Aye, aye guh aye" lol
@__PettyBetty_ ah, true true. Perfect sense. Probably one of the best approaches
Hell some people wont even follow you back if that avi aint on point lol
In real life, most wont approach you because of your personality, unless they already know you
@__PettyBetty_ what would you rather?
@iAmQueenRo yea that would make sense
@iAmQueenRo lmao I was flattered until the end lol
Especially since we can't judge that until we actually indulge in conversation with that person. I'm sure she was joking tho...right?
We approach by what our eyes see. Hey beautiful isn't always the best approach, but hey brilliant or financially stable will never be lol
People I guess don't understand that when we first see someone, physical aesthetics are first.
212 still bumps!
@TheCarter_Show means you knew the info
@TheCarter_Show congrats man



So basically I saved $100...good lol.
@ProfessorSlay lol I know. I don't really care for boxing so it's ok.

@neena_patrice free?
@CarmillaLusta @_minimehh basically 4 story arcs
@CarmillaLusta @_minimehh dang I was sleep. I agree you could get the whole run so far since 2011 reboot. All good
@TayoMarciano I can't think of any reasons to beat a woman especially your partner.
Don't respect him RT @TayoMarciano: The next question. So because Mayweather beat his baby mama, does that make him less of a man?
The moving episode of Married at First Sight. These apartments in NY are small and expensive. 1 bb for like $3500+. The fuck!
@sarrahsaysso lol don't do that
Hopefully me and Ro hit up some of them movies next year
@iAmQueenRo I'm seeing all of that. I have no choice lol. Probably wont care for the X-Men movies tho
@TheWoundGod saw that and was like the fuck?!?!

$180,000,000 for the fight
$15,000,000 per round
$5,000,000 per minute
$8…
Big developments for all the characters
I really need to see the Divergence, All-New All-Different Avengers, and Secret Wars FCBD comics
Lowkey salty I'm not in Tally right now. If I wasn't carless, I woulda borrowed some money and drove down smh
Glad I'm not invested AT ALL in this boxing fight. Yall doing a lot #OnHere towards it
@MissPouncy no reason really
@_minimehh Free Comic Book Day today. Hit up a store and see what're the deals
@iAmQueenRo lol I wanna be like that when I grow up
@MissPouncy I already did lol
@MissPouncy hmm lol
@whatsJSCupto oh.

@LadiesLoveKoolJ that too.
Everybody is graduating damn
@LadiesLoveKoolJ like the AoU version was so fleshed out and the speed powers looked better
@liberated_lez oooh ok. Guess I'll see in a couple hours
@liberated_lez so far I'm not likely chick who isn't attracted to her husband. She's teaching him to swim now
@liberated_lez you're up to date with the episodes?
@liberated_lez I couldn't get the first episode. Only reason I didn't start with that. I hope all this works out for them.
@liberated_lez yea. It's interesting. On the honeymoon episode now. Wanna go back and look at the first season later since black couple
Anyway, back to this Married at First Sight
@Anthony954 congrats fool
@_FreeJewel oh ok. Go rub one out real quick and tell her to simmer down
@CarmillaLusta I go out and drink whiskey, listen to rap, indulge in women yet still read my comics and manga weekly
@_FreeJewel hmmm....that's a dilemma then
@_FreeJewel lol your mind prepping itself
Since I've seen both now, AoU Quicksilver &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DoFP Quicksilver
@_FreeJewel cause you bout to be in Tally and them mens gonna be around
@iAmQueenRo them cops too live lol
@SassyE how I do my mom lol
@SassyE don't.
@SassyE lol she'll be ok. She's just worried about you
Being yourself while learning somebody while compromising on things is rough I'm sure.
If shit goes how it wants, I see myself being in a serious relationship by the end of year. I know how I'd handle in my head but...
@SassyE I'd just say "Mommy please, leave me"
@fabuLaja I see just the daily woes of learning somebody while they learn you. Everybody will go thru them
@kerrybtone of course. I'm listening to the album now actually lol
@taylor_NOTgang congrats!!
I'm in the wrong bed, wrong state tchwww
@N8dogg91 Lmao exactly
That's the worst thing RT @Missz_Jay: It's so sucky to go out...get drunk af..just to go home &amp; fuck yourself
@N8dogg91 all of it. Disney is going to be banking between Marvel and Star Wars
I don't believe this shit will ever get old
To Pimp a Butterfly is easy in the top 10 rap/hip-hop albums ever. The content, production, relevance, all that
You aint gotta lie to kick it, my nigga!
@yesmynameisEvan Oh lol
@yesmynameisEvan he went a HBCU?
@yesmynameisEvan I wish I coulda sit in for that convo
I been A1 since day 1 you niggas booboo!!
@N8dogg91 oh I already knew about the list. I'm all the way ready

@NisforNneka love you some brandy
Swag RT @YellowDevil_: Holup. Is that a honda w suicide doors? <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 

anti-blackness is just a hatred of black people in general. anybody can be affl…

b/c they will.
@PullMyyDreads lol I did
I think She is mad at me...
See it aint just white cops. Just fucked cop culture
@NisforNneka lol blessed you don't have a super long name
@NisforNneka Nneka is hard to spell?
@sarrahsaysso we had our pinning ceremony during rehearsal. So we were good collectively. But you probably not doing shit else, go
@sarrahsaysso no. Hell all of pharmacy didn't when I graduated. They just told us where to go. So just ask somebody
@_chinnaya oh ok.
@_chinnaya when do they start?
@_chinnaya yea maybe next time
@_chinnaya they left here about 30mins ago
@_chinnaya nope
Let me go eat this meat pie then go shower
The most the cops had the right to do was stop him because he ran. After that, they shoulda let him go
@TeriAmour lol, happens to the best of us
So the leaks were nonsense, of course.
Just heard some knocking around on the other side. Guy was never charged. Arrested, then let go. WELP
So the other guy who was in the truck telling his story as well. He's basically a witness. Didn't even know somebody else was in truck
Yall better be turning up at FAMU. Graduation is tomorrow. Get some liq, some food, some excitement, some sex, get it all
She coulda said this a couple days ago. Kinda late today
Still not here for the mayor tho.
Damn, already have 5 of the officers
@iAmQueenRo lmao. I can always count on you for responses like that
@RoofEOoh fuck the toxic police culture. I'll say that
They are really scared and keep asking will there be violence tonight
Exactly. Overcharging coulda been an issue
@iAmQueenRo thanks, edited
"Ma'am you don't know Marilyn Mosby, she only had ONE choice" Rep Cummings.
Freddie died a horrible death sadly. I really hate that he went out like that.
@iAmQueenRo 6 cops just fucked up, simple as that. Own up to it
@iAmQueenRo exactly. All they had to do was buckle him up and get help. None of this woulda happened. He woulda been let go alive.
@GGChanel they're scared. Long as I can keep a beard, I'm good. Bald heads or at least very low cut looks good on black men in general
Lol kinda hilarious the last officer to show up who barely did anything but didn't do her job can get at least 10 years
@GGChanel they're scared to go bald. I let my hair go 3ish years ago. Thinning was like fuck it
Legal knife on Freddie Grey, no reason for arrest. Asked for help, didn't get it, up to 6 times. If these 6 don't get convicted...
@marclamonthill yea he said official I was like who's he?
@fabuLaja your FB stay live
2nd degree depraved heart murder, just sounds like damn
And they have a personal amateur tumblr lmao  

If I arrest someone without legal cause, I'm damned sure gonna make sure they…
@CoolCalmnCold yep, she aint care. Lock her up too
Honestly, convicting these cops would be a good example for the police culture of America. Give them the full shit, to let others know
@iAmQueenRo yep. It's gonna be some problems
Wow. Just Might Be Ok has a video out?! Food and Liquor song damn. Gotta watch, fye song
Nope, that riot helped. Put a fire under Baltimore ass. Them young people did good in the long run.

me, …
@_FreeJewel exactly. We are in need of a big police reform
@Nigerianscamsss Like black guys like him make us look bad. Bringing up foolery just cause
@_FreeJewel exactly. The job is hard, sure. But that's what you signed up for. Do your job with the least amount of prejudge as possible
@Nigerianscamsss then this dumb ass black dude comes with that foolery, talking about go back to your community tchwww
This dude going in on CNN, going the fuck in. And this other black dude needs to fuck off
@ninasafiri_ oh lol. WELP
All I want are the police to do their job, that's it. Simple and easy
Because if that's what happened (I doubt it), them some shitty ass cops
At the cops from inside. She's not dead tho so thats good. But all that makes no damn sense.
Meanwhile, let's see what the fuck is up with this BW who was arrested and apparently put in the cop without handcuffs and was shooting..
YEEESSSSSS black lady on CNN. "If these kids didn't beat these policeses, whatever to these policeses!!"
@ninasafiri_ they have at least 3 charges. The driver has 6 charges, max 60+ years if all, one has 30 year to a charge
Like I said, negligence because these cops didn't do their job probably because they didn't care about that black man
That driver needs to at least get everything
I'm happy that they are at least charged. Now I need some convictions. It'll be a while but I'm optimistic now
Charged the 6 police officers, fucking good
That's the best way to be. You gotta be selfish about yourself first. Sometimes you gotta cut out toxic people, even if parents
@NisforNneka welp, sucks for her
@NisforNneka of course she wont call you either.
@NisforNneka oh, that's not that long.
@NisforNneka so you don't talk to her at all?
@Rich_Hipster whatever lol
@NisforNneka a bit
@NstructorNSPIRE oh lol
Birthday in 24 more days. Probably wont do anything, but I'll be 28
@Tiph_Seven yep!!!
@Tiph_Seven Oh, awww, that's nice. Now look at yall
@NstructorNSPIRE he?
@Tiph_Seven where were you?
@NisforNneka <EYES>
@Tiph_Seven lol maybe that's what it is
It's crazy how you can be attracted to someone who's states away. Just comfortable conversation and on always on each others minds
@iRondrea exactly.
@iRondrea I really like this show. I keep up weekly. The protest last week was too close to what's going on today
@Mmm_arisol really? Because if the draft?
@Leo_Debonaire just checked, wow
@MrBoykins18 idk the second guy lol. I'll see the tweets
@liberated_lez yea. You'll deal when that comes
#NFLDraft is on. I'm a playoffs football watcher. So idk who even is being drafted
@liberated_lez yea somebody gotta advocate for yall.
@liberated_lez damn.
@liberated_lez oh ok. I can only imagine how that'll eventually work out for you
@liberated_lez hmm. What are the options, legally? And are they even looking into polygamy in this country?
@liberated_lez marry whoever you connect with most and have a boy/girlfriend
Funny the people not knowing Will Smith is in the Suicide Squad movie, hence the bald head
Like are poly families really bad for America? Naw
@liberated_lez exactly. I see no problems.
@NaijaMane me too. She milking this a bit much
Coconut oil  
That people usually like my personality  
Easily, yes  
My close friends from college  
Yes and as long as me and her are happy  
Aretha's waistline. I make a lot  
Anywhere fun and be my wingman  
Modesty is um basic but timeless  
Comics, TV, optimism 
The son is hating this shit 
Damn, one of the chicks initially isn't attracted to the dude. Lowkey she's the least attractions outta all six.
Damn RT @MichaelHJordan: Look like its my time to strike RT @itsBX: Spotify Premium $0.99 for 3 months 
@SassyE @NaijaNupe_ do what you can with diet and exercise, let your genetics be the rest
@SassyE @NaijaNupe_ I don't need all that much beauty then lol
@NaijaNupe_ @SassyE or it fucks up your core
@iAmQueenRo the experts could fit better than the people.
@iAmQueenRo yea. So it's like why not. And they had experts for different stuff to match.
@iAmQueenRo I had to download. It's online but you gotta have cable provider account
@SassyE I hate this waist trainer trend. Everybody doesn't need a super small midsection
@iAmQueenRo going off the logic that arranged marriages fail less than regular ones. Matched by 4 experts
@iAmQueenRo I'm watching Married at First Sight on my laptop. Social experiment, they marry a complete stranger
Like, what happens in the honeymoon with somebody you meet at the wedding? Like do y'all kiss at the wedding, or handshake?
Don't even know what the person looks like, get married, and find out if you wanna stay after weeks, shits crazy
@brownskindevil coulda kept that part to herself...
@brownskindevil damn. Mom told me about this earlier. She just said she hated white cops. Not that she was gonna kill some
@fabuLaja that's real tho. They'll be ok
He's not a professional
Watching the Matchmaking episode, like the prelude episode. BM wants to marry BW, but they are all professionals and may not want him
I'm guessing none of these people on Married at First Sight don't use Twitter lol
@fabuLaja lol rude
@Kiaa_Said yea the premise is crazy but interesting
@Rich_Hipster yea I'm just watching shit on my computer
I get on twitter and all on this how old I look thing...i guess
@TayoMarciano might be ugly man <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Seeing what's going on with this Married at First Sight show. Imma catch up with this second season. Missing first episode of first season
@MizCaramelVixen few? I didn't think you were any older than say 35
Especially now that they are in cinematic universes now. If you miss one movie, you'll be uninformed on whatever may show up
Agreed. Cuz a lot of them reviewers don't know about the movies or watch previous ones
I need that one day
I need to stop RTing parody accounts. But that one was true
Reduced my phone contacts to 220. Honestly only actively use 10-20 on the regular.
@JJthemarvelous it's just crazy
Regular briefings throughout the day
So they picked somebody up inbetween arrest and sending to help Freddie Grey...
Police say they've exhausted every lead. Investigation isn't over, any new evidence will be investigated
Investigation handed over to the State Prosecutor
Baltimore Police News Conference going on now.
@3BlackGeeks exactly. He gone sit in jail until they get him. It's sad. And that stepdad shoulda just handled in home and wait
@3BlackGeeks Let the police find him, if they are looking, and don't say anything. Get a lawyer. Their kid is fucked
@3BlackGeeks He's definitely gonna get time, he could get life, those parents did that all wrong.
@3BlackGeeks basically incriminated their kid. He may or may not have been found or arrested but you don't assist with that
@brownskindevil now the system is being to hard?! Ah, duh my nigga
@brownskindevil the dumbest shit I've seen all week easily
More info: 
Blavity might be one of my new sites to visit
I turn on CNN and Ray Lewis being an inspirational speaker at a school in Baltimore...
@JJthemarvelous read the article smh 

Fuck that, they gotta come find my son if that happens. The stepdad makes $16K a year. They could NEVER afford
And he could legit get life in prison as the maximum but realistically 4-8yrs. The stepdad who made him turn himself in, doesn't regret it
And the award for the dumbest black parents award goes toooooooooooooooo...
Wait, WAIT! So BLACK parents had their BLACK kid turn himself in to Baltimore police, to a $500K bail

@ATadBitAwky this is true
@MsAreolaBrown lol
@ATadBitAwky lol cuz earthquakes kill too
Final Fantasy 8 
Funny but not funny, Cali twitter tweeting about the quick earthquake they legit just had
White people are amazing I swear. BM says don't use thug because it means nigger then you admonish for explanation

@NisforNneka me neither.
Fye Ultron cosplay 
FAMU grad right there. Doing it big
@ATallDarkMan been doing what they supposed to
Did the Nigerian army gain superpowers? Any finally doing what they are supposed to do
Randomly looked thru my Facebook I just keep for my friends. I got the good one, nobody was talking nonsense with the little I read. Lucky
@sarrahsaysso you know if FAMU is doing anything about this other than accepting less of those
@sarrahsaysso true. Hopefully they graduate at least in 5 years. But then we have them other niggas
@sarrahsaysso at least last 2 years it's been lower
@SophiaPetrillo_ lol he'll get back to normal eventually
Looks like Donnie isn't dead @SophiaPetrillo_. Just read the newest issue. Came out today
Damn that bad? RT @MissPouncy: Coming to the realization that I can't survive and pay student loans. Like... Wtf am I gonna do?
No food in this house, idk how I feel about this smh
@TheDuragGeneral lol it means like you that she's attracted to

@Zoe_Mega some women do it. You'd be surprised
@Zoe_Mega you can just say naw I'm good
The end of Endgame today was good. The whole arc was good. I just read and enjoy the story
@StahsayAli oh, I didn't know lol. Yea that
@StahsayAli yep, gotta read that later
Wish I could be more physical support for Her
Just read Batman 40...woooooowwwwww
If I don't agree with my parents opinion on something, I'm arguing lol.
@fabuLaja yep, they look at you, already know what you are
Is it weird I really don't care about the Pacquio/Mayweather fight, like at all?
@fabuLaja you look it. I can believe them asking
@fabuLaja oh ok
@fabuLaja you doing the ENTIRE marathon? Good luck
Nevermind, I didn't agree by the end, at least fully
When I put lol, I'm either smiling or actively laughing. I need to use it less tho. Nobody has told me that yet
@miAmorShakira lol oh.
@miAmorShakira lol idk why he even told you that
@iAmQueenRo lol why I have you to let me know. Since you actually use the app
@iAmQueenRo homeboy just said he downloaded on android and it's 10 and 20 to sign up. So just an Apple thing it seems
@diszy2011 hmm, welp, there it is then. It's mad confusing
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 true
@fabuLaja lmao
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 lol they gotta make it known I guess. Even I wouldn't think to go directly thru the website
@diszy2011 oh damn. Ok
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 oh cool. Thanks!
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 oh. Glad I  don't use Apple more now lol
@diszy2011 lol "nice" friend?
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 idk why they'd add do that, to overcomplicate it
@iAmQueenRo @diszy2011 oh ok. That makes sense. So on android it probably isn't the same cost.
@diszy2011 welp, they just fucked their growth. Idk what they can add to cause the average consumer to switch or join
@diszy2011 price is a big thing.
@diszy2011 I was wondering why everybody was saying that price and it wasn't initially that. Then I just read an article
Most won't pay more
No wonder TIDAL is more expensive now, they quietly raised the price 30% from $10 and $20... yea they just fucked the incentive to switch
At least at first
Let me look at this Windows Build event. Windows 10 is looking good. And everybody with Windows 7 and 8 are getting it for free
@miAmorShakira everybody has a slight lazy eye. I started noticing lol. I do too
Fuck, it's noon already
We all know, at least since the Seahawks incident, thug is the new keyword for nigger. I side eye any black person who uses it
@_FreeJewel I read earlier that he's fine and unharmed. Just was gonna take a while to book because of all the arrests
Nope, because you said it numerous times. You need to get on TV with this apology before we accept  
@_FreeJewel snatched him up real smooth like. I rather just regular arrest him
@M0NSTERAva a lot I'm sure
@Smooth_Orator we'd still be waiting. Fuck some shit up to put some fire under the ass of change
@Smooth_Orator it changed a lot because we wouldn't be talking about all these things with Baltimore and in general without that uprising
@GGChanel live into my baby sisters adulthood. Then they'll be good
@GGChanel yea. I always emphasize they gotta do better, tho they are trying. They need to get to healthy 80s. They are early 50s now
@GGChanel yea I read about starting with two, then going up from there. I'd just get her 4 sizes and have her take her time to increase
Russell Simmons my nigga on MSNBC
@insanityreport I was like damn, when she got that damn good
@GGChanel I told her about them too. She's down
@GGChanel so she gotta stay alive for like 30 more years lol. My parents are my health experiments
@GGChanel yea. She wants to lose some weight, and she's been eating better. And she has a 1 year old daughter now
@GGChanel or at least easy to learn
@GGChanel I gotta get some for my mom to use. I'd think it would be a good for her. Easy but effective
I hope my future children are as aware and knowledgeable as I'm working to be.
@NisforNneka she bout to overtake you lol
@NisforNneka you did good.
@iAmQueenRo the new Ro
@iAmQueenRo you didn't respond, what?!?!
@PinguinoBesos @ShonBoo safe sex, I see no problems
@3BlackGeeks guess I gotta go hurry and read Batman 40
@fabuLaja yea I hate that. Vote for who's points align with yours
@Anthony954 @fabuLaja lol Imma pay attention to everyone in general, especially since she's basically already the president by everybody
@fabuLaja yep. Cause we knew she was running even tho she didn't tell us
@fabuLaja and Hilary hurrying to make the first statement. Coulda did it a couple weeks ago
Just make it legal on the federal level, gay marriage doesn't harm anybody other than your beliefs, and it's not you so you'll be ok
Of course gay marriage is illegal in most of the deep south
Trying to fix my posture and elongate my spine a bit. Yoga will help I'm hoping
Imma actively try to keep up with the presidential campaign this year and next
@TheBlackVoice just a powerful figurehead. If the other branches aren't on his side, it's for not.
That means unarmed, you can never kill them. No unarmed man is a threat to a trained armed individual, especially from a distance.
Just don't kill these people who commit crimes unless it's last resort and your life is REALLY in danger
All I want is active acknowledgement. Because without that, change will NEVER come
All this lets talk is good, but the police have to be able to acknowledge they are the main problem right now
Treach Criss from Naughty by Nature is on MSNBC.

Comicvine gave Avengers Age of Ultron a 4 out 5. I didnt read the review yet but I agree with that score. The movie was awesome. Go watch it
@Britt_Alexa Oh that's what's up, congrats
@Britt_Alexa where you working?
@Tiph_Seven more than likely. We'll see come Friday, IF it even comes out
They probably coulda easily handled a few, up to maybe 150 kids. But they basically fucked themselves and the city up smh
Ironically the Baltimore police caused the #BaltimoreUprising . That's funny
So there was gonna be a Purge. Just no where on the scale it was because of the shutting down of the buses and trains.
 


^^^ This is how it started Mond…
@Tiph_Seven they are saying info should come out Friday. Idk if that will tho
Fuck spelling errors <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
People celebriting because it's the uprising. Not the parenting. Cause it's been on CNN numerous times, beating your kids
It's just funny a these white people saying Oh she's the mom of the year but if this was maybe a week ago at school, she'd be in jail
The mom beating on the child was scared for her son and just acted on impulse. Idc that she did, my mom would have done the same
Y'all got the name of the nigga who got snatched up? Y'all something else. That shit was crazy tho
Crips and Bloods talking on CNN from earlier schooling. This is big them getting together
Smh RT @PhenomBlak: "padded with extraneous action.” &lt;— That’s an actual COMPLAINT about #AgeOfUltron
@CarmillaLusta the Rapture finally coming
Even Bill O'Reilly making sense. Christ!
Well, I.. Uh... RT @FoxNews: "Every American – even criminals – should be safe in police custody."  —@oreillyfactor 
@MsPringles24 shit was so random lol
Wonder if She outta the gym yet?
@Tiph_Seven awww, this avi!
Curfew time. Let's hope the police don't get outta hand
@LEATHERorLACE I know, next time
@LEATHERorLACE gotta get a nap in next time before you get to being Betty Crocker
Got that sage to dismiss the negative energy like @iAmQueenRo 
@diszy2011 lol oh my bad. Ok
@diszy2011 cool. I know you stay busy. Yea make sure you watch Cap 2 also whenever you have time. Overall good action movie.
@diszy2011 it did the same thing with Cap 2. This one probably wont be a major tie in. Last one was because what happened in movie
@Leo_Debonaire me too, thanks
@Leo_Debonaire plan was to go like I said and it would have been like $6. So hopefully I'll go eventually
@Leo_Debonaire she's good to. Didn't go thru. Just no car for now
@Leo_Debonaire I'm good. It was traffic so I wasn't going fast and it flew into passenger part of windshield. My sister was there but
@Leo_Debonaire @JJthemarvelous oh ok. I usually see it the same day in the morning. Since everybody goes at midnight and cheaper
@Leo_Debonaire it was watchable lol. Go see it. It was good.
@Leo_Debonaire car got messed up last week. Random tire from a car into my windshield

Ultron was spitting bars the entire movie. Excellent villian

You forgot pigs and wild game too RT @VeganRevoIution: Black lives matter... more than Chickens or Cows lives... apparently.
Why he wasn't Shredder to begin with? Oh well I welcome him in
Vegan idiots smh.  
Still overstepping what is the main issue @MayorSRB

Okay... but why are there protests? Think back.... what was the ca…
Let's see what this mayor gotta say...
STOP SHOWING THIS MOM HITTING UP HER SON
@brownskindevil it wasn't written or done by Akira Toriyama. It was done by the studio only
They brought up Ray Lew on CNN
@brownskindevil Frieza came back for the newer movie but yea a new series set after Buu Saga. DBGT aint canon so I pay it no mind
The Nigerian Army actually is bout shit?! Well alrighty then
@pamnonga yep. Plus never know what the future brings
Golden Week sale on PSN and I have no damn money fuck!!!
So the game will only be on tv, oh
@pamnonga true. We gone here about you on a board one day?
@pamnonga and somebody of color

Just like they listened to MLK on that balcony?
We a hot commodity now

yall need to get with it... ESP bald + beard.... GUUURRHHLLLAAHHH
@N8dogg91 faved it, Imma read it later lol
See, the fuck?! Arrest the one guy, not pepper spray everybody
@sarrahsaysso turn up
@Rich_Hipster you damn right
No we should dissect and look into the word. Cuz after maybe a couple years ago, that word has infiltrated the media space
CNN not gone show what else he said. Context is everything, they know that. Gonna keep focusing on the looting part.
@Rich_Hipster hah
@Rich_Hipster bet you wont say no tho...
That's how you do it. Focus on why this is happening and being able to understand why the uprising happened yesterday. Big ups @deray <RAISED FIST>
Yep, this dude is that nigga!!
Yes @deray gone fuck it up on CNN
They really talking up the nonviolence today. Cause if this was yesterday, nothing would have happened.
I wish these adults understand that language used is important
I don't completely agree with Obama. But I can agree with some points and try to understand why he said what he says
@SassyE and they keep playing it I hear
@Pharaoh_B28 and now there's a focus on why all this is happening. Which is necessary. Gotta fuck some shit up so people pay attention
So the violence actually helped. Because what's being said today wasn't on Sunday
I don't think it took away from the message. The uprising made people think why is this happening. Cuz they were blind to it before.
And you know what tho, fuck it up yesterday, bring the media out cause they didn't come otherwise, now be peaceful.
He has to take both sides, which I may not agree with, but I understand
I feel somehow about that speech but I understand why he had to go that route. He doesn't get it easy. So I'm somewhat good with it
@insanityreport yep. Mentally thinking like I know Imma get shit for this
@insanityreport I couldn't be him
@insanityreport so it may come off as respectability politics. He'll get condemned for them points and the real points.
@insanityreport when you say that, makes sense. It's sad that as the President he has to watch his words carefully
@theAfroLegalise yea. I guess he gotta be politically correct.
Cowboy Bebop &gt; DBZ
Death Note &gt; DBZ
Yu Yu &gt; DBZ
Hunter x Hunter &gt; DBZ 
One Piece &gt; DBZ 
Space D…
@insanityreport at all. I wish he woulda led with those. But I'm at least glad he said it
@theAfroLegalise yep. But he didn't lead with it and was pussyfooting. But you know what, nobody else would have said this
And the news will focus on points 2, 3 and 4. They wont look at the important points, 1, 5 and 6.
@diszy2011 oh ok
You know what, even as all over the place and he was right and wrong, watch the attack he'll get with the little he says
@diszy2011 all over the damn place. See my last tweet
My issue is that Obama should have led with points 1, 5 and 6. Maybe combined points 2, 3 and 4. Watched language used. Stop pussyfooting
@_quietstormB yep.
And that's the problem. That the President can't federalize the police
Overall he fucked up with his language in points 3 and 4. He shoulda just said I don't condone it but I understand because...
Obama is really trying to say point 5 the nicest way possible. It shoulda been point 2. But at least he's saying this
Come on, don't fuck this up Obama...
Good question. Here comes the Obama answer...
Somebody tells you violence aint the answer, you gotta get Kanye on them 
@JJthemarvelous lol yea. The hype is real out here. I've outgrown DB and read it years ago. I'll check the newer anime out tho
@JJthemarvelous there's been like an upsurge of popularity. And the games too
@JJthemarvelous it was created way back in the 80s and finished early 90s. We got it later. But the new movies and DB Kai (HD old episodes),
@marclamonthill of course not, he's the standard black activist smh
@ItsLooon I'll watch it
Let's hope this "Rev" Jamal Bryant is actually listening to these students. Remember who started this first. And address that.
Dragon Ball Super. New DB anime post Buu Saga. I can dig it. DB has gotten much popularity lately. Plus DBGT wasn't canon
@iAmQueenRo @BrittanyBonet lmao
@CarmillaLusta @DatGirl_ICEY they were on the grounds tweeting when Ferguson first happened
@CarmillaLusta @DatGirl_ICEY I believe @Nettaaaaaaaa and @Awkward_Duck are some of the originators
@Tiph_Seven he coming on tv...might have to go take this shower instead lol
Reply, "Did you see what they did to #FreddieGra…
Meanwhile, the LG G4 is being unraveled. Another phone I gotta decide between when I finally am able to upgrade
Or at least on this scale.
This situation is simple cause and effect. If they would have AT LEAST handled the #FreddieGray situation better, wouldn't have happen
Donkey of the Day from @cthagod  to Mayor Blake. You can not agree with the rioting and understand why it is tho 

And them fight scenes!!!! The combo moves. That's what X-Men should be and yet...
Yep, AoU was a good movie. A fye ass, deep, comic book movie. It was better than Avengers simply of the story and character interactions
Shoutout to @rodimusprime and @SayDatAgain, @TheBlackVoice and the others who are letting it be known how these BM fucking up
Something on my mind, plus seeing the shit on here and been put on game. Felt like I had to put that out there real quick. Mini rant over
Because once they've let us go, BM are fucked. Because we barely support ourselves. All I'm saying is lets do better. They need/deserve it
It's ok to, hell you should, "cape" for black women. Because they've been caping for us since the beginning.
Correct your homeboys if they talk some foolery. Teach these young boys/men to treat women better.
Love them like they love us. And wanting to have sex with them isnt necessarily loving them. Uplift them, support them, be an ear &amp; shoulder
@IamEkemi if some hear, it's enough
So while all this shit in the world is happen to both of us, let's not as BM add on to that for them.
They aren't talking out the side of their neck. They aren't delusional. It aint some big myth, this shit is real.
Let's just be better partners to our BW. Do right by them as human beings, as the same race, as women.
But we expect them to be strong, to support us, to take all this shit and smile. "Smile baby" "Aye guh aye" all that shit
Sadly, BM are the oppressors of BW who are already being oppressed by white society. It's hard as fuck for them
They just want us to listen, try to understand, empathize with them, and do our part, show our support
Thru domestic violence, sexual violence etc. #OnHere they let their feelings out, and the majority of us either ignore or deflect/mock
Black women deal with that from the police AND from black men. You know who kills BW more than police...BM
See how the police are mistreating black people and they dismiss it like we are crazy even if we see it, have evidence...
@3BlackGeeks it wasn't simple, let him movie at regular speed while everybody moves slow.
@3BlackGeeks yep. So the Flash in the movies should be immaculate
@3BlackGeeks the speed effects in my  opinion looked better in AoU.
@Ljay90 lol I'm just seeing the tweets after eating. I agree with what you saying. Hilary aint doing it for me
Then @rodimusprime  comes in about how BM aren't supporting BW. And he's right. Like I said yesterday, we gotta do better
We taking notes RT @Ljay90: oh hey, we see you not saying anything Hilary. We see you.

#Baltimore #FreddieGray 
@fabuLaja just did. My fault
Damn @SayDatAgain  went ALL THE WAY IN on yesterday's podcast!! Speaking nothing but the truth
Bars RT @GeauxGabby: White history in 30 seconds.  
@N8dogg91 I how not smh
They wanna be heard and this is the only way they feel they can be.
Erica Garner saying what should be said. The destruction isn't right but it's the affect of years of cause by this system and police
All on the news today "I understand but..."
Don not getting what he wants outta them
An Igbo woman on CNN! Aight Ifeoma
Erica Garner seen the light. She's saying what makes. That these kids are scared and are like fuck
Good question. There's no school tomorrow but there's a curfew. That shit ain't gonna work
@JJthemarvelous dude is deflecting smh
@_FreeJewel now if he could do that more often lol
Nows not to question the past. Governor Larry Hogan just said this
@sdotpeeler no one.
@sdotpeeler if they were gonna kill someone, they'd be dead
@sdotpeeler if they were gonna kill somebody, they'd be dead
Funny how those gangs, who were gonna kill a cop each today, had ample time to and yet...no dead cops
@stunnatiff fake account
@ATallDarkMan like why tho tchwww
@MissPouncy @SassyE I remember that story. Crazy
@JJthemarvelous she not even trying to look at why this is happening
@JJthemarvelous I'm not liking her at all
@miAmorShakira yep lol
@ATallDarkMan one detty slap
Ma'am this is anger. Anger from agitation and lost hope
@miAmorShakira they growing or you swelling. Congrats lol
And she calls them criminals. Language is everything
Here comes the mayor...
White folks are upset in Marc mentions. Said what he said was disgusting
@yesmynameisEvan they really need too.
And he doing the right moves with the music too
@ImJustCeej Don like nope, I don't want to hear your reason
@iAmOshun yep. They feel they have too
Don is legit is not trying to hear this. @CharlesMBlow and @marclamonthill and the councilwoman only people with sense all damn day
@iAmOshun and the other guy
Don and other black guy not having it with what @marclamonthill is saying
.@marclamonthill saying we have to watch our language. He is absolute right. He understands and speaks what we speak on here. Need more
"The city is burning because Freddie Gray is dead!" @marclamonthill I appreciate this. Been waiting for this most of the day
And of course @marclamonthill is talking good sense as well. He's calling it an uprising
That's what you do as media.
Shout out to Charles Blow. Because he's talking both sides and talking about what's actually going on.
Even if what's going on is wrong, it's not in a vacuum. It's a reaction to an action by the police.
Don be like I believe you #WellActually
EXACTLY!!!! How this actually happen. Baltimore Sun speaking the truth it seems. This black guy talking gospel right now
Don, yall should cover both sides. As a news channel. Because you aren't focusing on that.
I can understand this councilman and how he feels, but you got to at least where this is coming from. It's not coming from nothing
My stepdad being a little more extra with praying because of this nanny lol. Like praying longer and singing and all
All I know is this all came from killing of black people. So I'm not as torn honestly
I don't care about injured police tho.
@crystalrae already there
Kinda torn with all of this in Baltimore...
@crystalrae the makeup master
@sarrahsaysso you got a nice ass place tho right?
Something that's not about nothing...ehh...
@sarrahsaysso dang. Hopefully you'll find something
So the Hawks lost...what the entire fuck. It's 2-2 now...
@sarrahsaysso lol what you come to?
Checked on my phone....Hawks in overtime.
@N8dogg91 smh shit sad
Clean as fuck RT @DrJDaddy: #KilledIt RT @AAbreezy: That moon walk tho!! RT @yagurlbubblez87: THIS NIGGA YO <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
@Zoe_Mega Oh ok. Gotta specify lol
@Zoe_Mega dang 95% is a high ass number
Awww RT @JJthemarvelous: @Leo_Debonaire thank you for having an awesome brain!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>

joc hit …
Joc has a good one. And been fucking these other women... Nigga tchwww
I'm hearing the mayor fucking up in Baltimore
At all RT @NisforNneka: I'm tired of people saying "pray for Baltimore". Prayer isn't gonna solve the ills here, guys.
@Mona_Love7 she won't tho smh
Why she still with that man and Karlie something else
She was suspended bout 1 episode
Gun in the hood, mob of police..."

Kendrick Lamar, 'i', #ToPimpAButterfly
I like this congresswoman on msnbc. Lisa Gladden. She's going into why those cops haven't been charged yet. Other guy trying to deflect
@SassyE I heard he was on there, maybe it would be kinda better....naw. They saying more on their side but the purging part fucks it up
So Rev Al and them are saying the kids planned this thru social media and are purging
@ProfessorSlay lol that's the "story" CNN is using
@_FreeJewel lmao exactly
@JRDSkinner yep. Group of minorities, lets call damn a gang.
@JRDSkinner I'm just watching just to see. But yea. Language is everything
If gangs are combining to fight the police, that, I would think, would make people think or ask maybe why
@apotheosist_151 yea other than them cuz they aren't talking about them
What's this black guerrilla family?
@_FreeJewel we are really talking about gangs right now. Like the biggest tangent ever
There's a lot of gang talk on CNN now. But...the gangs haven't even done anything
@stunnatiff see that's what I was seeing and thought too
I saw someone on here say. So was there a walkout? Cuz I'm hearing that too
@_FreeJewel oh ok. Thanks
Let it go down, the media spins it how they want, congrats. Criminalized black people
Yea, that's funny too. Police honestly if they wanted coulda contained this. So it's like they are letting this go down
The pastor isn't talking for me so you know...
Nobody is telling the kids to attack the police. Nobody telling me that and I'm like cool ok
@N8dogg91 fuck it up lol
@iAmQueenRo I'm just making mental notes. Like this shit is all kinds of crazy
Here comes the tear gas
Come on now @CNN. These kids didn't plan to attack no damn police, come on now. Let's be logical now
@iAmQueenRo lol
Theens get reckless =&gt; see police in gear =&gt; chaos =&gt; blame protestors and gangs.
Looks to me like Crips/Bloods/NoI link up =&gt; "threats" of gang violence =&gt; block off metros =&gt; middle/high school kids get stranded =&gt; cont
@insanityreport just like you said on the podcast this weekend.
Paint balls hurt so they aren't harmless
That one dude was fucked up.
@fabuLaja lowkey, this could be Tallahassee
If you are told that it's high school students from people down there, it's high school students
@stunnatiff I know. Because of a hunch smh
@_FreeJewel that white guy who's always on CNN. I forget his name
@stunnatiff I mean if it's out of control you come out in that eventually. Not right away
Welp, CNN just said this is the Crips and Bloods
@stunnatiff them being in gear, cool. But there's a way to handle this I'm sure. I don't think I'm seeing it on here
@stunnatiff yep
All ages, going after police...naw
@stunnatiff they'd just be out in the gear. But not doing anything
@stunnatiff @iAmQueenRo I agree. Shit is incompetent
The funny thing is this a big misunderstanding and miscalculation on the police. Like if they didn't shut down the buses...
Broken bones, unresponsive, oh so this isn't ok...I see.
Group of lawless individuals. So you gone lock up a large amount of grade school kids. Lmao. He called criminals
Nightcrawler in a MJ Thriller jacket lmao
Damn, they got that kid. He was running and fell.
Should the kids be doing this, maybe not. But key word, kids!!! Confused, provoked kids
THANK YOU, somebody said students.
@stunnatiff exactly. These are just kids. Of course they might act like this. You see them with bookbags and everything
Them kids fucking up that one car tho lmao
The problem with CNN is they are either willingly or unwillingly not putting out that these are students, not necessarily protestors
Especially with police in body armor around once you get off the bus, you like what the fuck
Also, remember they are kids, yep under 18 = kid. They act off impulse, if provoked. I mean what you think would happen?!
My thing is these kids, from what I'm seeing, can't get home. Just kids all over the street.

This was planned by the police.
It legit looks like 100+ police in the street
Ok, there are a lot more police than students out there. Like a lot more than would even be needed, in riot gear
@_FreeJewel if it was, I wouldn't even be surprised
Let's hope no kids get killed today. Cuz if so, it's gonna be a rap out there
@Ljay90 like they really aren't thinking any of this shit through
@Pharaoh_B28 I missed all that damn. It's look crazy in Bmore
AoU was good. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
@Pharaoh_B28 wish I woulda saw that lol
A lot going on on here and off here for me. I try to do things that I like and tweet those things as well to keep my sanity
@Pharaoh_B28 when was that lol
@verilymary plus I'll hold myself accountable on that
@verilymary I see no issues with needing that. I do that but we don't follow each other so you may not see that.
@iAmQueenRo then we are clearly stupid
@verilymary @SassyE I wasn't trying to put the focus on me and I was actually agreeing with her.
@verilymary @SassyE I didn't mean any argument by it nor meant it that. I understand my privilege yet still have empathy for yall.
@verilymary @SassyE no I agree completely
If that finally happens, BM are gonna realize how fucked we are and the dumb shit we've done
So Joker Leto pic was just a 75th anniversary Joker pic. The look for me is fine so either way I'm cool
@SassyE please don't. There are still some of us that support as we should. But I can understand how you feel
@Ljay90 as always. And the violence gets the people to pay attention now
@_lexiplexi oh, naw just regular twitter for me
@_lexiplexi some guy was talking about it's ok to slut shame the woman you wanna wife for stupid reasons
@_FreeJewel yea. Oh well, had to rant real quick lol
@_FreeJewel or he's serious and an idiot
Body count 100, might mean she and I will have a lot of sexual fun, I'll be her 101
Other than pure curiosity and laughs and giggles, as long as she practiced safe sex and doesnt cheat, as I wont, I'm good.
I don't believe in the word and how it's thrown around anyway. Yall do the damn most
If wanting my girl to enjoy sex makes her a hoe, then yes, I rather a hoe.
@TheBlackVoice I rather a woman who enjoys the fuck outta sex. These niggas something else
@sarrahsaysso school costs too damn much and they advising everybody "Just take out loans"
Twitter is a lot today...a lot.
@sarrahsaysso I read it when she was tweeting. She's right and it's very informing
@Leo_Debonaire true. I like the effort and it is making strides. Then you get into that too. It's complicated
@Leo_Debonaire then you can but can't just be changing races sometimes. We however need more black writers but that's another convo lol
@Leo_Debonaire exactly. And its even worse for black women superheroes. Like whats a good ratio or what not?
@MizCaramelVixen I was just saying. Cuz everybody on the cover isn't in the book. But I understand what you mean
I don't need all black heroes but I'd love a good mix. The thing is, what's a good mix, idk
I love there is more inclusion. I understand new character are hard to sell and for whatever reason harder is not white.
I'm always torn about people of color in superhero comics. I understand that it they started from an era where all were white
@MizCaramelVixen Spectrum is in the actual cast from what I remember.
@0hBehave that dude sounds all kinds of stupid
@Anthony954 oh, good luck
@Anthony954 yep. Flite on Friday, Grad on Sat morning, nap then eat with parents, Moon on Saturday night, dead to the world on Sunday
@Anthony954 that was me lol. I took a swig of Crown but I was at the Flite the night before lol
@CarmillaLusta ugh. I'll figure it out
@Anthony954 gotta have you a drink before you walk in on Sat
@CarmillaLusta I'm trying to see how Imma circumvent that. Maybe just lie on my job apps for now
@GGChanel BM need to do better. At least listen to BW and be more vocal and supportive
@GGChanel the problem with us I think is we don't support anybody really. We don't support BW or ourselves. It's all bad
@CarmillaLusta I hope that's not the case with me. I'm on Indeed right now looking
@CarmillaLusta how they say. I said it's very possible for people to look for months and find nothing
@CarmillaLusta they said I'm not looking hard enough because I don't have one now. I look on and off however the job market isn't like
@CarmillaLusta lol my parents. I'm looking for a minimum wage like job for now to pay for my eventual test and this small phone bill
Parents were saying if I want a job ( I do), i should look in 1 week and get something. That's not how the job market is now smh
@3BlackGeeks yea. I have a feeling too. Stuff in the movie that could be used for that. And yea I'm ready to see that cut
@BougieLa oh damn. I hope it doesn't take me that long
@3BlackGeeks It sets up his movie perfectly. If the movie was 3 hours, woulda been perfect
@3BlackGeeks and the trailer cut all those scenes perfect. Had no idea the inner workings. That's good
@3BlackGeeks it was a big setup movie. The one character at the end, idk why they did that tho.
@3BlackGeeks I agree. Me too. Me and a friend discussed it was kinda cluttered but I enjoyed.
@iAmQueenRo he married but you right
@BougieLa how was it for you when you first got employed?
@3BlackGeeks you liked it?
@iAmQueenRo he don't want you lol
@BougieLa shit. I was looking for jobs on the internet, was on a hospital and saw a plethora of nursing jobs. But yall get hella apps
Biden seems like such a cool geniune individual
And She probably gonna keep me on my toes I see. She very much involved emotionally into all of black/women/human rights. She's a empath
I'm glad for the BW on here I follow who thru their tweets educate me on shit I was ignorant to. I'm always learning
@BougieLa they do that? Make them BSN?
