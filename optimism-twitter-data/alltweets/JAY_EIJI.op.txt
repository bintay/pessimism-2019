Prom last night was so much fun!
Any prom after parties?
Dinner and prom tonight
Spelled it wrong <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Okay? Lol
And it doesn't make sense
You're actually right. Yet here I am.
Accept the love I know you deserve.
Without communication; yet it's all still there. With hopeful thinking, I'm staying optimistic that one day you'll come back to me.
I don't think I've ever loved anyone as much I love you.
You're beautiful.
I just want us to happen. I want to make you happy with all my love.
@michellecarbaj8 you don't even know who I'm talking about! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I'm just scared that it wouldn't work out again.

We come from two different worlds but there is only one us, that can makes things easier

You can swallow your pride.
I just want you to know that I did it for you

By late tonight I'll know if my grade dropped in Chem. I have a B+ currently. Let's hope it sticks
But that's cause I haven't turned in hours for the month of dec. or jan. But when I do that number gone be low!
If I work 54 more hours I'll get another half credit
I'm not so confident about my final scores today. :/
What I like about my 0 hour is that it's a class I don't have to go to and I get credit :)
@lexie_alaniz you already know I'd totally go
There is 7 kids in 0 hour from bio then like 19 from SFE 2 from ACE and 12 from ISC. Wow
I love me enough for the both of us.

I'm so tired I really don't want to work today
I should probably finish the first verse too
I gotta keep writing, revising, changing, and testing. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> I still got a bridge to write
Part of Verse 2 'No Love' 
It's like sharing something about myself with the world. It just seems too surreal.
I really do hope this song turns out amazing, if it meets requirements I could actually have it published as a single on iTunes.
No Love is about loving but having them not accept love. It's about wanting it but hiding true feelings, it's about denying yourself love.
Looking back at it now, I have no regrets I think to myself everyone "gets what they get" and at the end of it all we must all forget <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
11 to 7 tomorrow :/ oh no buddy
But I died of laughter knowing she had my box in the car when in reality I had forgotten about my box <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
