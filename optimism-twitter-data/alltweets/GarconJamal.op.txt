@OmarKelly Haha I thought you meany Joe Thomas of the Browns I was bout to go crazy!
@PhinManiacs Did you just really say that?
@flasportsbuzz Man would've been nice to acquire Collins.But its cool!!!Were the New Dolphins!!!
@AdamHBeasley I like the way you think.But I'd love Matthews to be an Injury policy.
@DolphinEret Ohhh that's whatz up!
@JasonLaCanfora But he said he wanted to play left tackle......Woo9oW the confusion
@AdamHBeasley Boy I'd be Happy with that!
@_RMatthews COUGH COUGH LAEL COLLINS!
@MichaelCauble @DellengerAdv Did Label sign with Cowboys?
@PhinManiacs No doubt in my mind that if Mia gives him a contract with Guaranteed bonus money(Which Ross Will) he'd sign with the Phins.
@flasportsbuzz He also says Miami is in the top 3 of Collins places to land.
@PhinManiacs Report:He's visiting Phins within 24 hours.
@MichaelCauble @MiamiDolphins YOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JamesWalkerNFL Wishfuuul thinking
@illmatic99 @ESPNNFL :)))))))) Daaaaang hahaha
@ErickFalero @JoeRoseShow Lol if you were a patriots fan and this happened to the Phins what would you want?
@iHeartMiko There trynna find something to hate on.
@monkshui @daviddann71 Maan honestly what I'm hearing Miami's on top of his list.But Cowboys aren't far behind even before Visit soooo.
@70LaelCollins Do what's best for your future bro.Pick the team you think it's right!God Bless!P.S. Go Phins!!!!!!!!

@OmarKelly Whoooo? 
@OmarKelly Yea I've needed one since the age of 1
@OmarKelly omg you hate dolphin fans bro just say it already!Stop holding it in like every analyst!
@OmarKelly May you please give Dolphin fans at least one thing to be happy or optimistic about the draft? -_-
@Phins_Phocus What the heck!!
@Joe_W_Dolphins You can't teach to shed a block for real????
@Mike_dolphins @Phins_Phocus @jaredv87 Yup!
@Phins_Phocus @Mike_dolphins @jaredv87 how do we know any of those other guys would pan out?
@Phins_Phocus @Mike_dolphins First person to actually tweet the truth!Thank you sir!!!
@ckparrot Yea we will see about that when Phillips plays an actual NFL game
@AbramsonPBP COUGH COUGH
@Direct_Snap Not good for Phins!!
@ArmandoSalguero dang

@ArmandoSalguero Nuhuh they get Dupree
@ArmandoSalguero YEESS PARKER TO PHINNNNSSS!!!!!!
@2KSupport Whats up with the server???
@OmarKelly @cogator06 Julius Thomas injury is significant and Emmanuel Sanders has a concussion.What could this mean???
@OmarKelly Julius Thomas ankle injury is significant,Emmanuel Sanders has concussion,and Montee ball just couldn't get loose.I hate injury.
@nesarias @BigOShow outcome please?smh
@KupandCrowder Excuses for the heat but none for the dolphins right.  ;)
@OmarKelly I BELIEVE Fins can do it.
@OmarKelly. Two straight defensive player of the week for the fins!
@OmarKelly Matchup to watch this week?
@OmarKelly There basically doing a fully how on the phins on sports center at 9 really?!?
@OmarKelly Man some great recognition for the Phins on 
@ckparrot Or we already have Safetys SMH..Always trying to start something
@OmarKelly @Joex518 I remember people saying the same thing about Brady but what happened.
@iHeartMiko @SBW82 @BGrimey21 You got your husband slipping head over heals for you in the game...Tell him leave that for home.
@OmarKelly Please stop listening to DULL fans and tweeting on what they say.Especially if it's just one DULL fan.Or Fake fan.
@OmarKelly Guess what Brown's have a better record than us.
@OmarKelly OMG really
@OmarKelly @Yoshifett_BRB If Brady played them as well as Tannehill did Well a games a game.but it's Tannehill so it doesn't matter !FACT!
@OmarKelly I wonder if he's playing to his strengths. Meaning game manager etc.
@OmarKelly What's IT?Explain?
@OmarKelly He needs competition or needs to be set straight.Or just curse of being a dolphin QB
@OmarKelly Confidence,stripped by people around him.
@OmarKelly Sounds like we're the Raiders.Does it not be honest.
@OmarKelly Come on man....It isn't the end of the season it's only week 5.Please please stop.
@BlueMcawesome Aren't u a fin fan?WTH
@OmarKelly Was he able to do things with his original team.It took him a better surrounding to get his numbers up.
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Nice...Seems I gotta wait at least 5 years to have a chance at the super bowl
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Lol your right. How does it feel to have an established team btw
@Dah_knee He has some ability that's really help him
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly yes This organization is very disgruntled. In many ways.I have no choice but to agree because it is true
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Well see in coming weeks.We have some pretty good players coming off injurys and suspensions.
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Gainesville throws behind recievers some games and others balls are on target.he's Also inconsistent if you didn't know
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Yes I understand.but if u watch dolphin games you'd see what we mean
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Yes dropped passes aren't helping. tannehill can help by being a little accurate as well.
@OmarKelly Omar Mode AKA beast mode!!
@Dah_knee @OmarKelly Well the running game has actually improved
@OmarKelly Give him Seahawks defence
@OmarKelly @Dah_knee Cough Cough what does Russel Wilson have?
@OmarKelly Yes.Consistent the right way
@OmarKelly that's phin fans 4 u
@OmarKelly no
@OmarKelly yes
@OmarKelly According to bleacherreport we are the worst division in football.Congrats to us!!!!!!
@OmarKelly Is there a chance Knowshon Moreno returns in week 6 against the Green bay packers?
@OmarKelly Knowshon Moreno*
@OmarKelly Is there a chance Jonathon returns in week 6 against Green Bay?(let's see if you answer)
@OmarKelly I've realized this team is all over the place.no identitiy
@OmarKelly Patriots didn't score like this.
@vjheadquarters You are really beautiful!! lol.
@OmarKelly #two minute offence worked
@OmarKelly @cbassrules Jonathan Dwyer is arrested on Domestic violence charges 
Aggregated Assault
@OmarKelly Why against us lol.....always
@560WQAM #TiredOfIt
@560WQAM We're talking bout the phins so you guys can go to conclusions and Since you guys can tell the future they won't be good...  SMH!
@560WQAM Tell the guy on his cheap phone saying we're a middle classed NFL team..SHUT UP..Its only week Two.You guys always say that butttt
@560WQAM Mike pouncey practiced today for the first time since June. Think he can make a difference to are O-Line play???
@JasonLaCanfora Lol you go kick it then
@ryantannehill1 Has to run after it.And Go get it!!Just throw it a LITTLE earlier and you'll have Wallace with that speed running after it..
@ryantannehill1 Get it to Wallace just throw it a little Earleir try that that'd work.If you throw it earlier and he's more closer he.......
@ryantannehill1 Hit while throwing the ball and that keeps you from gaining momentum to really throw it as far as you can.and if you wanna..
@ryantannehill1 And on last thing I must stress on Let the deep BALL RIP..i see your problem it's sort of like you think your about to get..
@ryantannehill1 You are the leader of this offence show it!!!!And be it(the leader).Take control audible when u think it's needed. #Beast!?!
@ryantannehill1 Your the man just fix a little accuracy issues,run when under pressure(SLIDE)and just unleash your arm when bombing it.
@ryantannehill1 When the pressures on you shrug it off and act as if you've done this a billion times before.Just keep on doing what u can
@ryantannehill1 A lot of people are doubting you but I'm not,you gotta use the God given gifts you have.run man run.And you could do it BOMB
@OmarKelly @Ttime561 if it wasn't for THill holding the ball so long twice the o line would've only had Two sacks given up so it's not bad
@rizers1 @OmarKelly It's only been two games woooooooooooooooooooooow
@OmarKelly That catch though by Wallace
@OmarKelly I understand the lunch money part,but the they can't run without Moreno I don't get.they kept trying to pass so we don't know yet
@MiamiDolphins let's go
@OmarKelly Man it's a great warm day over here
@nfl Where have all these bills fan been??
@OmarKelly Smh
@OmarKelly Biased fans
@OmarKelly Phinz Up!!
@OmarKelly Alrigh Omar good night man.And keep us updated on the game tomorrow.Tell B.Albert Protect the Hill.Tell Tannehill throw accurate!
Still not underestimated Buffalo
@OmarKelly Tough Bills D? How many yards did the Bears put up? 427? Culer 349yrds.....Forte 82trds on only 17 carries?
@OmarKelly Hey if the canes finish the season off Undefeated from here on out you never know buddy" O"
@OmarKelly Hmh good luck to them Tomorrow
@Healthdonor @KupandCrowder Man hoe those guys play there hearts out for him .
@DolphinsDouche @OmarKelly Yea basically
@OmarKelly @DolphinsDouche your doing what most fans do and bring up the past.
@OmarKelly I would ask a good question but I'll always be ignored by you.
@OmarKelly Currently watching 30 for 30s the U.Do you think The dolphins can play with that swagger or Attitude????
@OmarKelly You think he can match his performance against Buffalo
, is 
X@560WQAM @KupandCrowder 
 
Cx.    ,IN A. Xxx xj
@560WQAM @KupandCrowder 
D
@OmarKelly If the phones overachieve or reach 10 games then you'll be like oh snap I told y'all but it's wateves
@OmarKelly Aww shut it...
@OmarKelly Omar who's your Favorite team?WooooW.
@OmarKelly No not Clay.And really bottom 16 I don't get it.The receivers are very good.The Running Backs eh I could see where he's drifting.
@OmarKelly Hey seems the phones are making sense probably looking at your tweets Mr.genius
@OmarKelly I'm not an egg anymore you still gonna ignore me lol?
@OmarKelly Tannehill is 5th all Time in NFL History with the most passing yards through his first two seasons.Is that interesting?
@OmarKelly Hey I think The Jaguars will be good this season.
@OmarKelly I don't get it if we Have a good QB we don't make the playoffs but if we do have a good QB we only win 9 games sigh
@ESPNNFL You guys say There defences or suspect but what about your QB!!!!!!! lol
@OmarKelly Ain't that a bad thing?
@OmarKelly Come on man Ain't you got church
@OmarKelly Because defender was holding on for dear life.And what I'm saying is the O line on half of the running plays did open some Gaps.
@OmarKelly Hey Omar just watching game again and play before The Gibson TD.Lamar Miller almost broke it in for a TD run.Only got Caught
@OmarKelly.calm down Omar.
@OmarKelly And that includes heat fans watch when the NBA season starts no one will be there #FakeFans
@OmarKelly Of course fake phin  fans will comment on this and agree because they aren't real phin fans I loooove the fins but not the fans.
@davehydesports Gigantic lead.
@davehydesports Sure there are bad but come on if I counted the amount of times you guys have said the bad things to good bad would have a
@davehydesports Sometimes I wonder why the dolphins have team reporters.SMH -_- Just once I wanna consistently say some good things.
@OmarKelly Maybe you should evaluate the third preseason game when the 1ST TEAM is actually in longer than one series.
@OmarKelly Tannehill looked soooo Poise
@BasedNeel @ESPNNFL You smell like ass
@OmarKelly But flags kept there drive alive so not to concerned yet
@OmarKelly Yea one flaw found on defense and there too aggressive which isn't bad but there too aggressive getting unnecessary flags
@nfl Elite!!!!Lol not yet I'll give him until week 8 and that o line blocking wow
@OmarKelly Seen that Confusion they caused Bill lazor right Noww looks smart
@OmarKelly Ha
@ESPNB0Y @MiamiDolphins If we weak why you over here worryin bout us.SMH someone's scared go fins!
@JasonLaCanfora NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@OmarKelly I wonder what you think of Sammy Watkins.I'm guessing beast because he isn't on the dolphins
@ESPNNFL oh man.
@OmarKelly He can.Point blank.Give him the opportunity without throwing it while he's in a tight space getting blown up.
@_FlamingoBarnes @NFL_ATL No he isn't joking
@OmarKelly I guess that's why Jones wasn't as good last season it's all coming to me now.
@Atlanta_Falcons @nfl let's go phins!!!!!
@Atlanta_Falcons @nfl @ATLCW Lol why is it only ask Atlanta when to teams are playing,you guys really leave some teams out of conversations
@AdamSchefter You guys suck for commenting those things
@OmarKelly Hey if Tannehill is getting picked off so much by Finnegan imagine how much he'd get picked of against Revis and Browner
@OmarKelly off topic but the team just signed another tight end.I don't get it Dustin Kellers still on the market not like he's Crippled
@OmarKelly if the o line holds up what do you think Tannehill is able to achieve yards wise?
It was Hoooot
@chrisperk @OmarKelly Yea right it Hott
@OmarKelly ITS HOTTTTTTTT!!!!
@OmarKelly I hate preseason are they ever going to Shorten it?
@OmarKelly well if Ryan Tannehill gets rid of the ball quickly like they say he's starting to Pass Rush won't be an issue would?
@ESPNNFL only reason I wanna watch the bills is to see how good Sammy Watkins actually is because everyone's talking about how good he is
I just got a NBA Locker Code for 100k VC at 
@OmarKelly Johnny Football to Vikings making them pretty good next season.
@maddengames1221 I'm in

@CoracaoSup Beautiful face
@DarrenSproles come to the Phins and you'll never regret/forget!!
@OmarKelly If we fix are o line maybe remember SAn Fran had one of the best O lines in football
@OmarKelly AGREED
@560WQAM @OmarKelly @AKuperstein @KupandCrowder LOL
@OmarKelly There's a safety on the market I wouldn't mind seeing in miami
@OmarKelly who do you think we might go after in free agency or the draft running back wise.
