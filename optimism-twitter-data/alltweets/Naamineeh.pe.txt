義経の最終回の時この愛すべきの天使侍が死ぬから私は切腹するかもしれぬ
fun fact the picture on my dp is named "stroke" in my folders lmao i think i had a mental breakdown when i saw him smile
so when he dies I can listen to both song one last time before following him in death as the good samurai waifu I am. #ドM
I have decided to not listen to 花華 and キセキ until the last episode
how do you all deal with your overwhelming feelings ugh i'm dying ksnjfbdjbreknrjn
Excuse me while I'm shedding tears over a dead samurai rather than my last exam tomorrow.
なんでこんな運命になってしまったの？！
この天使<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
BUT I LOVE HIM SO MUCH AKSBDEJBDJGBRHEB
He makes me so emo
considering i tend to start weeping every time Yoshitsune sheds a single tear just imagine how much this episode killed me bye
#PROTECTYOSHITSUNE1K85 <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ONE CAN BE WILLING TO HURT THIS ANGEL HAVE YOU SEEN HIS PUPPY EYES 
to be honest, I find my profile picture really disturbing but I also find Yoshitsune gorgeous on it so I don't want to change it
...since it's so rare now you know 
@cookiekakumei ça peut pas être pire que l'espagnol orz (même si l'espagnol est techniquement facile mais c'est chiant xD)
@petenshimachine haha with that hair true
@cookiekakumei oh xD bon moi j'écoute des chansons russes donc pour la prononciation je pense que ça ira après le reste je sais pas x))
@cookiekakumei sérieux t'en as fait? ohh pourquoi? xD
j'aimerais bien en faire x))
en vrai je viens de capter mais le russe on dirait l'alphabet phonétique mdrr
I'm so 明希ギャ omg since when am I so 明希ギャ?????????
I can't believe my 明希ギャ-ness
@Miku93_Official Unluckily for you I'm in the mood to love him hahaha Puppu-sama love <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
lol now i'm getting feels for bald anus every time i see toshiya's face.........
@KazeNoChou this might take time though xD i don't have the motivation to start it haha
If you don't find Gong Li beautiful I will have to stop trusting you tbh
like do you guys realize that if i make it to the 49th episode i'll be a widow
wHY AM I THINKING ABOUT NARUTO THOUGH I'M IN PHYSICAL PAIN FOR MY 御曹司
it'll take more convincing to make me watch one piece though lol
and i KNOW i'll probably end up in love with itachi and cry for him
sometimes i really want to watch naruto but ugh if only it had less episodes
Idk who I hate most, the emperor or Yoritomo but I think it's Yoritomo because as his brother it's even more unforgivable
sERIOUSLY IM SO MAD LIFE WAS SO UNFAIR TO MY BBY
I hope Masako will enjoy the death of her daughter since she didn't want to see him so much ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
Yoshitsune was the only one who could move the hearts of Yoritomo and Masako who were cold as stone and yet they did that to him..
These episodes are getting a bit too heartbreaking for my taste though so that's it I'm stopping at episode 40.
YOSHITSUNE WANTED NOTHING BUT LOVE FUCK Y'ALL T___T
YORITOMO YOU FUCKING SON OF A BITCH WITH DADDY ISSUES
WHY DID YOU NEED TO BE FLAWLESS TO THE POINT IT LED TO YOUR DESTRUCTION WHY <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><BROKEN HEART> 
'''"""recover"""" more like cry about his perfection and sad fate lmao
english phonetics can suck my dick i need to see my baby Yoshitsune to recover
"that just shows what a small person i am"
YOSHITSUNE SHUT UP YOU ARE THE BEST HUMAN OMG I DONT ALLOW YOU <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

#明希はいいにおい wwwwwwwww boo-san pls
@gosailthesea @mytranghuynh aki looks mesmerized by his presence though
like even his best pals don't even talk to him that way LOL
I don't think people should use keigo to comment on aki's posts but the way people write to him sometimes o___o'
@mytranghuynh I approve of this
@yukimeru yEAH SAME HAHAHA but consider Japan is a different galaxy from ours ww
LMAO IMAGINE AKI IS PLANNING TO APPLY FOR MAO'S IKEV PROJECT AND BECOME A VK DANCER BYE
these clothes make him look so short though
@yukimeru I kinda like it xD
@yourregulargen and forever epilated

I didn't know my favourite bassist was a hip-hop dancer 
@yukimeru I KNOW RIGHT THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED BEFORE WE WERE EVEN BORN

Akishiko is so important and precious aksjndkhjbjshzfhb this boo <HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW>

He's such a perfect person and if he does look confident in what he makes I don't think he realizes how great he actually is <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Like Toshiya is my favourite bassist in terms of sound but Aki is my favourite MUSICIAN and his basslines make me happy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><BLACK HEART SUIT>

forever baffled @ how gorgeous Takki turned in the past 10 years #lrt
ugh my lips picking has gone out of control after my finals it gets more bloody as days pass
@gosailthesea makes sense, i still remember how much i ate that day huehuehueuhaudjbhfbrerkdjnkfj
(or someone was bringing cake and i was staring intensively)
lol i found this pic of me at a marriage in 2011 i look like i'm plotting a murder 
@gosailthesea yeah sometimes combing my hair is too tiring and I have to take a break lmao (I'm not even kidding)
My team won akapsvapdjaosjaishaov I should've gone to my parents' and watch the match
But sweet words get me troubled so quickly ew
I hate it when I suddenly start having a guy in my thoughts and I have no idea why ughdkslsbs enough feels already, brain pls
This shower got me so exhausted I'm sitting in my bathroom too lazy to put on clothes lol
I can't sleep so I'm in the mood for a nice bitching session lol
Now that I think about it though I don't think girls are prettier they just don't look like cheap asses whores like in Avignon lolol
@Gaeruchan382 I feel you.. Too bad they can't understand that not everyone is the same
And strangely the girls are prettier here so what's the deal is everyone lesbian omg
I don't even think I've seen a gorgeous boy there ugh
Talking about boyfriends this city really sucks in terms of boys I swear the boys are a lot more handsome in Avignon
@Gaeruchan382 don't listen to these dummies who would jump on any boy just to fill the emptiness of their boring lives <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES> boyfriends suck
@cookiekakumei @XXX mddrrrrr jsui morte c'est vraiment des mongoles :')
Like T&amp;T lyrics are quite easy but it's true that it's obvious if you compare it to SID XD
It's true that I've noticed that idols' songs lyrics were much simpler than what I'm used to haha
@cookiekakumei mais en fait c'est quoi qu'elles ont retraduit ? XD
LMAO #LRT in high school some profs hated me so much that they'd yell my name to scold someone else <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@cookiekakumei genre apprendre l'anglais c'est trop dur XDDD
And school wasn't much help lmao when I think I got 20/20 at the English baccalaureate with my level back then... Lol
I had a dictionary with me and I had to use it for every page but hey now I can die over old men on twitter isn't life beautiful :)
This truth #lrt actually my English understanding sucked before I got my shit together and started reading noblesse in English
@cookiekakumei c'est clair s'ils sont pas contents ils ont qu'à se démerder avec le japonais puisqu'ils sont si malins -_-
You → Yo → Yosh → Yoshitsune.
Always in the mood for Yoshitsune.
YES. 
like ive been told i look underage lmao
followers-sama lol i need u for those who have seen pics of me: how old do you think i look???
i love how i always try to avoid socializing but end up socializing anyway lol
bitches won't even wear a suit so i can see who's got nice ass so i don't see the point really
like why the hell would i pay to see people's awful faces that i can see everyday at school getting stupidly drunk ew
are people really going to that "university gala" omfg i would still not go if i were paid for it
lol i tried to do an exercise before sleeping and a sentence says "what a boo" yEAH IKR YOSHITSUNE IS SUCH A BABE /sobs
omg you know what im going to sleep again hoping i'll be feeling better tomorrow
i've been tired all day idk what's wrong with me but i'm REALLY sleepy and tired and dizzy
i've been napping since 6pm and it's 9pm and the only thing i want to do is sleep til tomorrow
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists: タッキー＆翼 (20), シド (12) &amp; LIPHLICH (6)

@Chiinyan__ hAHAHAHAH THAT'S THE BEST ONE OMG

hAHAHAHA I CAME ACROSS THIS THING I MADE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS MAKING FUN OF BING TRANSLATIONS OMFG 
(rather that than being cold though but it's hotttttttttttttt)
IT'S HOTTTTTTTTTTTT DAMNNN IT'S TOO HOTTTTTTT
Yoritomo and his damn wife Masako can rot in hell seriously my hate towards them knows no bounds
baby don't hurt me no more
but i literally shed tears because Yoshitsune was too precious for this world omg i can't believe it
He was writing the Koshigoe letter in this episode and I think it's a pity they didn't quote it entirely because it's very beautiful
I HATE WHEN THEY DO RECAPS OF HIS LIFE LIKE YOU DID IT 3 TIMES AND I CRIED 3 TIMES ARE YOU DONE YET
brb crying @ yoshitsune episode 39

i'm always getting headaches though so maybe not
strangely my jaws or gums and teeth don't hurt much but maybe the headaches/dizziness comes from here idk
I just noticed a part of my wisdom teeth broke through my gums
Ohh I think I might have found the reason why I've been feeling weird in the past 2 weeks
can the boo let me chill i'm trying to clean my flat and he keeps posting selfies
@Cara_puce i like him ://
@NakomaFarna Too late indeed 8)
@NakomaFarna Mmmh it's just that I had kinda forgotten about my undying love for him a bit in the past days? So it feels weird now xD

@gosailthesea I didn't but I insulted the onion many times for smelling like shit and killing my eyes
I mean onions are my worst enemies I fucking hate this shit but it's needed in this dish and you can't feel it so
If you want to hear another shocking fact (sit down before you read that)

but i really have a thing for the silver one
@yukimeru SAME OMG WHY
i would've been crying through the whole encore though lolllllllllllll
the songs before the encore are crazyyyyyy though omg enamel +propose + yoshikai + memai I WANT THAT
@voxteiru yepppp it is but light hair suits Nyan ://
i think it looks weird on Yuuyamoto
((if the Nyan approves though I approve))
BUT YUUYA PLS
IT'S THE SAME COLOR AS WHEN AKI DYED HIS HAIR BACK IN 2009 AND IT LOOKS LIKE PISS ONLY IT SUITED AKI WELL BECAUSE EVERYTHING SUITS HIM
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED HERE 
I SAW A PICTURE OF YUUYA CAN I UNSEE THIS OMG YUUYA WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
But I do agree that if you don't understand French I could tell you to go fist your mother and it would sound like a compliment
I always giggle whenever I see people refering to French as a "romantic language" when we basically have a word to say "slap with a dick"
Mashed food incoming ?
You'll know in the next episode 
sudden nausea very good timing since i'm supposed to cook but i can't taste it otherwise i'll puke right away

My 826 years old boo causes me so much pain seriously
This fucking Yoritomo is literally pissed at Yoshitsune for not doing something that he never asked him to do??????? get your shit together
I'm just so heartbroken at the shit Yoshitsune got for being an honest, trustworthy and bold person.

if you ever post or send me a screamer you can be sure i'll wish you the most painful death ever and i'm not even sorry
@cookiekakumei hahaha merci de ton soutien

literally why the hell would you restrain yourself from liking something just because too many other people like it LOL
among things i can't understand one of the first things is "i don't like it because it's too popular"........ why ?????
Photoset: Yoshitsune VS Naam. → Naam = instant kill.

Personally I'd rather speak 2-3 languages well than knowing only the basis of 12 languages
Languages take some time yknow~
Focus on max. 1 or 2 at a time otherwise idk how you can succeed
I don't understand people who study 14 languages at the same time and complain that they don't progress in any lol
hurray for me who couldn't get the word "borough" during my english exam OMG I WANT TO STAB MYSELF

@alicenyan410 (<HEAVY MULTIPLICATION X>╭╮<HEAVY MULTIPLICATION X>)
@Sushikasuki pareil xD
@Sushikasuki oui c'est vrai que c'est un peu cher après ils ont des trucs rares aussi *_*
A lot of people got butthurt at some things I said about him though so I guess everyone has a different level of criticism they can stand
I'm not blind and though 90% of the shit talk I do is a joke I criticize him a lot too but I don't do it without a reason ok
I don't think anyone who's ever talked to me can say I don't accept objective criticism towards Aki ???
@NakomaFarna I can understand people being pissed or scared (I am so, too) but you can't blame him for changing stuff within the band??
@NakomaFarna Well I guess all artists have to face this kind of shit but the solo announcement provoked weird reactions
@NakomaFarna He doesn't deserve that orz
@yukimeru I KNOW RIGHT IF AKI TURNED INTO HYDE I'D KILL HIM WTF
(lol @ me defending Aki's solo but seriously i can't stand people attacking him for the wrong reasons)
And if they haven't released anything since december we all know it's not his fault so shut the fuck up??????????
it has had no impact on SID until now and ARENT THEY TOURING RIGHT NOW
I've been trashing Aki probably more than anyone else but you know what so far i can't find any reason to blame him so fuck you
IF YOU WANT TO BE MAD @ AKI FOR HIS SOLO PROJECT OK BUT AT LEAST HE'S ACTIVE WITH SID NOT LIKE SOMEONE
aRE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW
i'm so mad because a fanpage is trashing aki for his solo project saying that he is not hyde who can manage perfectly l'arc &amp; vamps???????
@yukimeru so right omggggggg i can't believe they took a 12 years old to do their vids
Aki is a SID member?????????? 
i'm always baffled by how amazing and pretty SID announcement videos are omg 
/pure sarcasm
@Cara_puce votre tube de seins XDDDDDDDDDDD
ehhhh Aki used his sunburst model in most songs ;;

@yukimeru i'll pretend i believe you <KISSING FACE><KISSING FACE>
@yukimeru LMAO IM SO GLAD IM NOT BLIND BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS LIKE "WOW SO COOL" AND I WONDERED "BUT I DONT SEE ANYTHING??!!?"
@pietarajuku Je sais même pas comment on peut prétendre vraiment aimer la MUSIQUE et ne se limiter qu'à un genre ^^
oh man i'm reading my english lessons and LMAO at the mistakes i make all the time i really suck oh my god
@KokoroKira Ohhh I thought it was the light XDDDDD
Well at least it would make sense XDDD
@yukimeru JUST SENT ME A TEXT ON LINE PRAISING AKI.
WHERE IS GABI THIS IS NOT GABI.
@Cara_puce Mddrr bonne mémoire ;)
Je l'aime trop je trouve que c'est l'une des plus belles chansons d'amour du rap français
les fans de booba sur toutes les vidéos de rap ils viennent et ils disent "oui mais booba est mieux" ??? wsh calmez vous????????
cette chanson elle est . putain . de . lourde
tout allait bien
y avait quelque chose de spécial entre nous
un amour bestial entre loups
j'croyais être l'intouchable celui qui décime les femmes mais le cœur dessine des fables dont le sens reste ineffable
Et si vous voyez pas le génie dans ses paroles j'suis désolée pour vous
Vous pouvez dire tout c'que vous voulez sur Nekfeu "suga" mais l'instru elle est juste magique.
psa: it's not because you don't need to sing in rap/hip hop that you can do it with a shitty voice, sorry
mom just called 
mom: so how are your exams going
me: l o l 

sorry i hope my sis' will be better daughters than i am lol
明希シコが髪型変えたって言ってたけど、、何が変えたの？？？？？？全然見えないwwwwwww 色は同じ、スタイルも同じ、、マジで見えない…私めしいなの？！笑
@Lilice_SID 8'D je vais venir les taper.
@Lilice_SID ooooh tu tombes sur de gros cacas toi dans les gares j'ai remarqué 8'D
@mytranghuynh good luck !! 
finals suck but we must be strong 8)
@Lilice_SID o_o comment t'as fait pour rentrer?
i'd like to go there too orz 
@hadakanomind Not only the plot and cast is awesome which makes it a very good show but Takki is... too gorgeous. Like-- /too much/.
@hadakanomind Very true 8'D
And yeah... I recommend you watch Yoshitsune 8)))
is it normal to wonder what your bias looks like with natural eyebrows lmao i've always wanted to see aki's brows
@gosailthesea Yeah if we ignore the stupid tattoos it's very ok I guess
@gosailthesea lmaooooo this actually comforts me because i was very puzzled
It's ok bald anus you can keep on being a strange giant squid it's too late for me to take my soul back from you anyways ha ha ha.
Aki is one of the biggest mysteries of life.
/sighs and wonders why I chose him
@gosailthesea but im seriously wondering if i missed something or everyone is just kissing his ass omg
@gosailthesea yeah and even the front strand was there before so??? 
i'm so confused bald anus pls explain to me
and everyone in the comment is going "it fits you so wellll<BLACK HEART SUIT>" ????
am i the only one blind or------
@gosailthesea I literally dont understand what he did, especially since usually when he says he changed his hairstyle it's TOTALLY different
I'm proud of him for understanding the value of black hair though <OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
"changed hairstyle"
???????? 
i ran out of nutella..............omg how do i live
like those egoisitic asses of europeans' would do all those efforts to HELP people lmao the thought is cute though
it was about how useful war is to help countries facing poor conditions/dictatorship/terrorism and i was like L O L of course
but the text we had to work on was so annoying lol i kept rolling my eyes every 2 sentences
french exam was annoyinggggggggg ;A;
but tomorrow is my last dayyyy ah it's also the one with more exams /dies
When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
I also hate Nelly because his lyrics are stupid but his instrus and flow are fucking perfect"my place" is a masterpiece.
I've singing along to Mariah Carey and JLo's songs all morning lol back to my musical roots.
Strangely relaxed for today's exam (๑¯◡¯๑)
@mytranghuynh QuickTime how cruel of you.......
has Yuuya outgrown the kpop boyband style lmao
@mytranghuynh I'm sending you two hip-hop songs I particularly love! One from 1997 and another more recent ~
@mytranghuynh There used to be good rappers with beautiful lyrics but they disappeared ;A; (same in the us though)
@mytranghuynh Like, I adore hip-hop and I feel like it's probably the genre that makes French sound even prettier
@mytranghuynh As for hip-hop, it's ~growing~ but it's also pissing me off because all the hip-hop we get nowadays is terrible ._.
@mytranghuynh Ah yep I remember Nyan mentionning that and was like "lol, Nyan really?! xD"
@hadakanomind I had already cried like 3 times at episode 5?! 
I'm the "very emotional mess" type though but it's soo sad ;A;
@hadakanomind Ohhh really?! That's awesome, tbh I'd like to hear 花華～僕とあなた～ and キ・セ・キ in the Yoshitsune parts because it fits well there x)
T.M.R's songs are so sexy I swear it shouldn't be allowed ;A;
T.M.R's "Aqualovers" is the kind of song I'd like to sing with Aki in a karaoke.
Lol there is a city callec "condom" in France xDD
Hadn't had a real night of sleep in forever, that feels so GOOD.
@jasminvincible mmdddrrrrrrr les formules magiiiques des marabouts d'afriqueeee
@hadakanomind Definitely unforgivable &lt;/3 T__T
@gosailthesea i wanted to send you a pic of his boobs but i guess you got to see them a lot in the past week lmao
@gosailthesea happy birthday Gabi !! have a picture of a very cool &amp; sexy young man 
Seems legit.

(is actually 44y/o man) 
I don't understand why the best album version of 卒業～さよならは明日のために～ is a thing though??? The 2wenty2wo version is gorgeous
キ・セ・キ came on shuffle and i want to bawl because it fits the episode of Yoshitsune i just watched T___T
おやすみ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
@gosailthesea lmaoooo what do you mean, isn't being able to carry guns great !!!!!!
Yoshitsune president
i cant believe people are dumb enough to vote for these people smh no wonder our country has no future
and """"glorious"""" history lmao more like assassins colonist with a superiority complex damn europeans
i love when politics make ~beautiful~ speeches about our nation and glorious history ok yeah have you seen the unemployment rate
@jasminvincible MDDRRRRRRR ça vaaa tant que tu savais pas

@Lilice_SID de la poésie pure.
@Cara_puce mddrr pas du tout ohh
Even his sister lied to him I'm so sad T_T
He's just trying to be that gentle thing doing what he believes to be right and people screwed him ;-;
I'm so angry though why did life decide to do this to my dearest samurai ?!
His destiny was so unfair he never deserved that ugh.
This episode was a kind of recap of the whole serie so far and damn he becomes unbelievably beautiful as episodes pass /sobs

And then I got really fucking mad and started thinking "idk I'm pissing on your mom's anus bro"
I kind of went hysterical during the management test lmao I started laughing at literally every question
I'm so confused @ myself why I didn't study ???!!!!!!?????!
@LisaCtti c'est clair c'est comme les autres tel au final...
Vous abusez a dire que les iPhones fonctionnent pas longtemps le mien il a au moins 4 ans wsh arrêtez de rager non
"You look very pale"
That's reassuring. I thought I was transparent.
Stress is a great thing

I am very annoyed and disturbed by Takki's ability to ALWAYS look cute and gentle while being the most beautiful human on this planet
Honestly I know I rambled about LIPHLICH much lately but.
Listen to the accoustic version of "My name was", seriously.
お手紙やプレゼントもありがとね(´∀｀)
今回色んなことを教えてもらってる僕の師、Kimeruさんと。#龍狼伝

寝ちゃう(…
18周年♪みんなありがとう☆
i can't study anymore T____T
whatever, i'm gonna fail my life
/going to bed like the loser i am
In the current case though I have no idea of what it's talking about 8)
If I had some confidence it'd be 100x better but even when I know the subject perfectly I'm convinced I'm going to fail orz
Like I love learning and I have interest in almost everything but it induces way too much stress and I don't react well to stress
Honestly people say that you miss school once you work but I don't think so, for me at least
@yukimeru haha the perfectionist lazy ass type huh
I FUCKING HATE IT AJDLAJDKA
@petenshimachine lollllll exactly the same as here -____- it's like "sorry if you didn't pay 103910€ we don't care about you" :D
Lol I was cutting some vegetables and because of TMR I cut my finger, thanks XD
Me: *doesnt work*
Me: *aims for the best grade*
@petenshimachine omg that's so coooool how does it work??
@petenshimachine aww really? Did they have a good excuse at least? D: I can't believe bitches can lose a birthday card
me tomorrow: 
like even if you know the whole goddamn textbook by heart he'll ask you things you've never even heard about in your existence
I don't know how the fuck the people at my uni are so ready and confident for tomorrow's test???????????
oMG I HAVE TO MAKE FOOD FOR TOMORROW TOO I WANT TO DIE ldnjezgjz
alright if i calculated well i have no other choice but to be an absolute killer at my 3 english exams otherwise i'm screwed
Naam i want to stab your sorry ass
though i suck at grammar because they ask us to know things that??? i've never seen??? or heard??? in books??? or from native speakers???
after these two damn exams studying for my english exams will almost feel like being on vacations lol
Chill mom 
honestly im screwed for this one lmao
psssstt wanna know a secret?
i'm a shit
If I ever happened to become a teacher I'd like to be the funny teacher type
I honestly hate my management prof but he was so funny lmao we had a good time together
@gosailthesea I have no idea about where this expression comes from but it's my favorite thing
one day late because wishing a happy birthday in time is too mainstream for diva-ruki #LRT
dO I LOOK LIKE I GIVE A FRICKLE FRACKLE
it's 7pm and i have yet to learn a whole semester of british civilization :DDDDDD
YOU GUYS STOP COMPARING TAKKI TO FRIEZA-SAMA OMGEI IM CACKLING WWWWWWWWWWWWWW

左：滝沢秀明

ドラゴンボールは世界の名作で人類みんな知ってるって信じて疑わずに生きてきたんだけど、歌舞伎観劇レポで「フリーザって何？」って言ってる人が結構いてビビった。笑 
@Gaeruchan382 Ahh bonne chance alors T_T

☆☆☆☆\(⌒▽⌒)/☆☆☆☆

@Gaeruchan382 sérieux ?? Wah j'irai voir *_* merci de l'info !
No orgasm will ever top the pleasure I got from locking my macroeconomics notebook forever in a corner of my room
To think I'm majoring in Japanese and I've spent more time studying economics and law than the language itself this semester BYE
I've been basically traumatized by macroeconomics #lrt
Me after my test: what is microeconomics what is this paper with formulas on it no clue lol I really don't know what this is bye
@Gaeruchan382 pareil hahaha rah j'en ai pas bu depuis l'année dernière je vais mourir @_@
i wonder if bald anus went to hiroto's gig????

@hadakanomind I mean, having LINE on your phone is nice xD
@hadakanomind Eeeh but just, why ? xD
Depending on the procedure though it might be practical for you to register?
@hadakanomind Ohh I see haha ^^
Tsubasa represents all the Takki fangirls omg
@hadakanomind Have you found me ? ^^

i find truly inspiring stuff in my files sometimes 
学期が終わったら色々なことを英訳したいなぁ。
けど、、ちょうど思った、多分AKiの英語歌詞も日本語に訳す？？
英語が知らない日本の方のため＞＜
難しいそうなのにやってみたい！( ´ω`)
Most student seem to have failed it very hard though so maybe they'll be kind with the marks
Aw the Nyan is having a nostalgic moment ;;
So I threw some complicated words I knew I had to use but I couldn't explain them because of this ugh
Overall it was better than what I expected but I didn't have enough time at the end and had to rush the last question so I don't know? ;-;
Finals day 1 <HEAVY CHECK MARK>️
@gosailthesea IKR just look at him omg people
@gosailthesea i once read he hit his wife lolll
@__LilyCarroll It doesn't work on me xDD
"努力した人が必ず叶うわけじゃない。
でも、成功した人は必ず努力してる。"

Should definitely remember these words.
努力した人が必ず叶うわけじゃない。
痛いほどわかってる。
でも、成功した人は必ず努力してる。

@gosailthesea ah well Hyde is so famous that there's too many rumors and it's hard to know which one is true huh
@gosailthesea mmmh if he never had any major problem with his throat he probably didn't?
@voxteiru He seems alright now but he's doing a lot with his tour etc so ;; 
Aww +1pts for Ohara wwwww (though WHO isn't)
@gosailthesea welll as long as his voice is okay..
Mao toured 3 months after a throat surgery last year I'm still freaking out about it
@__LilyCarroll I know hahaha but akjbdjbgjrbhefheb I'm so bad at managing my stress ;;;
@voxteiru Yeaah apparently it was short and then it was okay but-- T___T Queen keep your perfect voice forever please <BLACK HEART SUIT> ;;;;;
@gosailthesea Yeah the screaming doesn't help... At least his voice condition didn't get bad?
@gosailthesea that's because he's so rOCK AND ROLL \m/ lmao but seriously he should take some rest omg
Hyde is an old man 
Nyan is sick as fuck
Nishikawa's voice vanished at Inazuma

Guyssss have some rest T___T
literally what the fuck is wrong with my 3 fave vocalists these bitches won't take a day off to save their lives gdi
@__LilyCarroll Aww thanks ;-; <BLACK HEART SUIT> 
I know it's entirely my fault for not studying before but damnnnn I hate this subject /sobs
it's midnight already....... should i read it again ugh i feel like my brain is about to explode
I only have one exam tomorrow but it's by far the most stressful one... I wish they didn't decide to have us take it on Monday 8am ._.
Honestly I can understand Chinese better than this page full of shit 
My head hurts but I must read it again and feed myself but I might just fall asleep mmh.
He seems so obsessed with him I ship it. That's it. 
Keyman. Or Friednes. 
My new otp.
Like "look at this stupid little fuck thanks for the inflation bITCH" but 60's version.
I like to imagine that if Friedman had a twitter account he'd spend his whole time ranting about Keynes.
I'm totally out of my mind today I swear ignore everything I say lmao (though the advice still stand for the rest of the time).
I'm using periods in tweets guys the end is coming. I hate periods.
But for the first time he did it in a cute way though &lt;3 he was just べぇーing at his husbando.
Lol @ me always ranting about Akishiko showing his tongue and putting him as my phone wallpaper. Oh the irony.
明希シコ嬉しくなそう 笑

I SHOULD BE STUDYING OMG NAAM SHUT U P
Well I did the same with Aki though lel it took me some time to figure we had a lot of similitudes
But I'm a poop compared to this boo<BLACK HEART SUIT><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I'm confused though because I didn't imagine for a second that we had similitudes.
I unconsciously liked him because we're alike?
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists: タッキー＆翼 (44), Lycaon (18) &amp; LIPHLICH (12) 
At any rate he's definitely I N F... I'll wait the end of the drama to tell whether he's a INFJ or INFP. But I'd go for INFJ
But he seems so INFJ ?!
But isn't that me being deluded and thinking we're similar? XD
I believe Yoshitsune would be an INFP ? 
That would suit him
He's too naive though.
And I'm very naive as well. 
This wouldn't work.
I have no doubts that he is absolutely everything I love for a man though <BLACK HEART SUIT>
I'm trying to guess the MBTI type of Yoshitsune (according to what I see in this drama of course) and ahh it's harder than I thought
me: *eats high-fat dishes all day*
me: *doesn't use skincare products*
me: damn why my skin looks so gross life is so unfair
It might look like I'm having an introspection moment but actually I'm just trying to act like my finals don't exist so ignore me pls <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But it might just be my personality in the end?
I've never been the type seeking for company or even sympathy from others
And I obviously do that too, if not even more so than other people do
All this time I was convinced that I'm like this because I learnt the hard way people will leave regardless of your efforts?
Meanwhile I give near to zero fucks about how people see me or what I can do to be better to others
Like I see them often wishing such things as becoming a better person toward others, someone who people can rely on
Sometimes I look around me and I think I'm the most egoistic person in comparison to all the people I know ?
T_______________T Yoshitsune cried again 
/emotionally destroyed
Alright my brain cannot take it anymore.
I'll watch an episode of Yoshitsune because his smile is healing <BLACK HEART SUIT>
And then back to studying.
@yukimeru it ended me seriously XDDDDDDD

明日から試験の４日間だ

Ohhh Aki went to Kamakura pray to the daibutsu for the tour （^人^）
if a truck suddenly wants to fly and land on my pathetic self right now i'd be thankful
#LRT elephants are too precious for this world ;-;
@mytranghuynh Or older artists who came back to the music industry :/ I don't really like French music tbh
@mytranghuynh As for popular music in France, no idea D: I just looked up the charts and it's mostly pop from artists I've never heard about
@mytranghuynh Her voice is nice, but I think people mostly don't like the character xD Hahaha yeah Stromae became really popular o:
i'm in total stress because i'll have to study each exam right before taking it since i have no time anymore i majorly fucked up
(ps i showered)
u know it's finals time when you're like "but if i don't shower i'll have more time to study the european inflation?"
Nyan RTed Shinji's tweet hahahaha these cuties
I'm exhausted physically and mentally and I can't get my brain to memorize anything else
and i had no clue about where the fuck i had put my phone ew
i love when the electricity suddenly goes off for no reason it's such a cool experience when you're terrified of the dark &lt;3
if you use your boo's expressions it means you're already in too deep \m/,(•。•)
well i guess once again i'll have to skip studying english and go yolo-mode hope it will work ;;;;;;;
i'm never gonna make it..........
I get very nostalgic about pictures of my little sisters so I can only imagine what it feels like for my parents?
I just realised how weird it must feel, as a parent, to see your child grow so fast
how come I see a lot of people abroad like Zaz lel she's a kind of paria there so it's weird to see she's popular abroad xD
@lizedsaltina omg tell me about it I write in English all day and I still have no clue about the pronunciation of 50% of the words lmao
@lizedsaltina oh yeah if he went to live there it's better to learn at least the basics to survive XD
@lizedsaltina haha yeah but since I'll have to level up in Japanese this summer I take it as practice
@lizedsaltina As a translator though the thing that's always been bugging me with Japanese is how the words have 468 different meanings orz
@lizedsaltina I plan to post translations of the past 3 months when I'm done with finals (n_n)
@lizedsaltina figure it out with the context. But when you're speaking you can't invent words so you're stuck XD
@lizedsaltina I guess it's speaking?? Cause like, when you're reading a text even if there's a few words you don't understand you can try to
lol @ people concerned about him fasting it has nothing hard and it's actually good for the body so ease your mind
I mean my translations weren't glorious either when I started (the opposite actually) but I never pretended I had studied it for a long time
and honestly she gets is wrong 80% of the time lol
no way,,,, her translations are so confusing and even i who isnt a native speaker can tell the way she writes in spanish is weird af
she pretends to have been translating japanese for 2+ years and studying translation?
lol i have nothing against the girl running this spanish aki fanpage but she's got to be a liar
This is the best one I've seen so far XDDDDDDDDDDDD 
forever thanking aki for that time he used すっぽん in a post cause it was in my test last week and i could never have guessed otherwise haha
@lizedsaltina Thanks but I still have a lot to learn ;-; Yeah that's the cool part though, ah I miss translating XD
@cookiekakumei Haaa bon soutenons nous dans cette épreuve XDD
@lizedsaltina My level is not anywhere near good though lmao though I must get my shit together now that I study it at uni
@lizedsaltina I started studying it 2 years ago just a little before I started translating Aki's updates lol (→thats why it was so terrible)
@lizedsaltina isn't he?? hahah he confuses me sometimes but meh, Aki &lt;3
@lizedsaltina Yep it's easier if you have someone who can help, too
Aki you stupid little fuck
@lizedsaltina Well it's time consuming and not an obligation so just do it if/when you feel like it I think ^^
@lizedsaltina ahhh thank you omg i didn't think of checking there!
sending you what he said via tumblr cause it doesnt fit there~
me when someone says they love my bias more than me: 
it's the most disturbing thing ever to throw french expressions in an english sentence for me tbh
I think the only person who loves Nishikawa as much as I do is Aki so let's do a menage à trois tbh
Very very perfect human 
the verses are soooo pretty oh my god his voice can make everything sound gorgeous I love him so much
IN FACT I LOVE AMAKAZE VERY MUCH ZKBSDHKBJEZFBHVH AND THE ALBUM IS COMING OUT IN 11 DAYS IM DYING AHH NISHIKAWA &lt;3
@cookiekakumei toi aussi tes partiels commencent lundi ? T_T
@lizedsaltina Oh, why do you say that? You can't say you suck at a language you didn't learn x'D
@lizedsaltina Awww too bad, I wonder what he wrote X'D Don't worry though, I didn't even see he posted something so thanks n_n
it's saturday my exams start monday 8am and i have yet to study economics + management + law + english aha aha aha aha(~n).
@voxteiru i've listened to it several times and i think i like it more than their other stuff it's very gooddd
左様でございますwwww
義経殿はこの時、ちょうど27歳だった( ´ω`) 
@cookiekakumei Ouais ça m'étonne pas xD Mais Aki dans toutes les autres photos que j'ai testées c'est une femme aussi XDDD
honestly this accoustic album of liphlich is amazing
excuse me but because of how rarely i watch the news i kinda feel like kate middleton has been pregnant for the past 4 years
I'd like to climb a rooftop with Aki and push him off it but we both have a fear of heights so neither of us'd go :/ 
Man of my life <BLACK HEART SUIT> 
@Cara_puce Mdddrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr j'adore comme ils ont ignoré Aki d'une force magistrale
aw look, it calculated the ages of SID members ;) ;) ;)

Akishiko you 69 years old lady hahaha
しかも女の人 
@__LilyCarroll it's weirddd though because i dreamt of kissing Nishikawa, now Takki whom I both love VERY MUCH but never Aki ;A;
i also like how they look like the total opposite physically because one looks like my mum and the other looks like my father xD
they were so cute back them ;-;
now they're fighting with each other every time i see them xDD
Just found this old picture of my sis' omggggg my babies <BLACK HEART SUIT>;;------;; 
And after all this time the only person i'd like to have a romantikku dream of keeps dying in my dreams, Aki why u do this
I'll kiss you again anytime baby boy (in my dreams or irl, just dispose of me as it pleases you tbh)
I dreamt about a full kiss on the lips with Takki /dies/
@__LilyCarroll ewwwwwww I hate hosts and hostclubs, wtf Kouki :(((((((((((
@__LilyCarroll WHAT OMG W H A T.
@__LilyCarroll Yeppp and he's fragile health-wise so I hope he will be ok TwT I will miss their music though...
@__LilyCarroll I'm worried for the others though especially Ko-ki this fragile little thing ;;-;;
@__LilyCarroll Shin is an amazing singer it would be such a waste if he stopped now omg ;A;
@__LilyCarroll that's one of the little heartbreaking things i hate about disbandings D:
"ex.ViViD" huh......
:(:(:(:(:(:(
音楽業界に携わり思うことが沢山ありました、次世代のミュージシャンの生活を支えるために出来ることを…
also Yoshitsune's sister, Yoshiko's face is so symetrical omg did they choose the actress just for this
this makes me so sick like if you used your ass to get there you'd better close at least your mouth since you can't do so with your legs
hahaha when people tell others they need to get a job if they wanna make it to japan when they worked in the sex industry
@__LilyCarroll CANNOT TURN DOWN AN INVITATION TO DANCE TO NISHIKAWA YOOO
What did Aki do again sigh grandpashiko pls
@__LilyCarroll dON'T AWAKE THE FEELS IN ME
Takki's baby smile makes him look the youngest &lt;3
I THINK ONE JAPANESE FAN GOT REALLY PISSED O M G <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
HITSUGI I LOVE YOU BUT THIS MADE ME LAUGH TO HARD OMG HOW DID THIS EVEN HAPPEN
IM CRYING IT SEEMS LIKE A TURKISH DUDE HIJACKED HITSUGI'S ACCOUNT ON HIS SENDAI KAMOTSU TWITTER <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

going through my old tweets is kind of embarrassing since i'm a major MESS but mAN SOME OF MY TWEETS ARE TOO FUNNY
@__LilyCarroll IM LAUGHING SO HARD AT MYSELF OMG XDDDDDDD
found an old tweet of mine wtf naam <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
How do I unlove someone
but seriously i'm dying
no wonder his vassals are so loyal, i'd die for this smile without a second hesitation too
*casually having a stroke* 
@yukimeru omgggggg thank you so much ベイベー ♡♡ he's too cute ajbdjbedhbjb that's too much dying over Nyan for one day ;-;
@yukimeru Awww don't worry I just waited patiently while studying economics (and wanting to commit seppuku) :3
but why omg
omg in english do you say "study economICS" ???
i've been wrong all that time
#fuckengrish
I wanted to translate his bio too but LOL hakata-ben = nope XDDDDD
Oh, maybe I should post a translation of Nyan's tweet of this afternoon~
@xTerra_Madre Mouais c'est difficile à deviner mais bon pourquoi pas :'D
the only thing that makes me love my body is that it doesn't take weight because with the shit i eat all day i'd be a whale omg
IVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOOD FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS LITERALLY WHAT THE FUCK IM GOING CRAZY MY STOMACH IS ENDLESS
you'd think i'm thinking about a way to change the world's global economy but i'm just wavering between nutella waffles or noodles tbh
@xTerra_Madre Ben en fait si tu connais son sexe tu peux utiliser she/he ^^ Mais quand tu sais pas "it" est pratique du coup~
i should be teacher i'm pretty good at summing up things aren't i #lelnope
can't we just learn that an economy based on debt will lead us to apocalypse and the usa fucked us sideways with their damn subprimes
this economy lesson is giving me headaches because everything about the debt economy and liberalism is so wrong i can't read that shit omg
No one ever doubted you could overcome that. Because you're the strongest to us.
You can pretend it was only to show your ring I don't take that shit the 歌える is all that matters right <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Mao you little motherfucker you posted this pic on insta too because you're so proud to sing right <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
Because that's what life is all about 
Like it's not criticism but GIVE ME THIS POSITIVITY INSTEAD OF LETTING ME DIE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE MY BABIES
I would like to understand the people who are happy about their band holding live/tours they will not attend
@yukimeru do you know what he exactly means? cause if i get the general meaning i'm not too sure with those weird verb forms xDD ;;

超懐かしい...!!!!

Hiroto you little thing let me pet you T____T
(i'd take any version of phoenix though both the song and pv are perfect)
omggggg the projection mapping ver of phoenix is so cooollll i love it
also i guess he wasn't authorized to do it before
the fact that he used 歌える instead of 歌う means a lot to me tbh
hoping from the bottom of my heart that his condition really got better //
"歌える喜び"
"歌える"
"える"

I thought Akishiko was the most technologically impaired of them but that was before Yuuyan got a twitter <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
blasting T&amp;T's catchiest song full volume to not fall asleep but I'm afraid macroeconomics is stronger.....
after my finals i'm going to go to the shop and buy 15kg of chocolate and binge eat myself to heaven
the worst is that all i can think about right now is eating again
i stopped eating 2h ago but i think i'm having a nice hyperglycemia now lol it's been a long time
and if you didn't like the last episode of fma 2003 you're pretty much dead to me so
in fact i hate the fandom they have no taste since 70% of them prefer fma brotherhood lol
the truth is despite the fact that fma is my all time favorite anime i'm not at all involved in the fandom lol
the fma fandom has the most cruel jokes i've ever heard in my motherfucking existence i hate them all *laughs with tears on her cheeks*
lmao me 
the worst is that i spent all day wandering around in Shinjuku doing nothing but spending money SO
every time i see a picture of Ryo i regret not going to Hollowgram live when i was in Japan because i could have gone to this one
you don't understand he iS EVERYTHING
I seriously don't know what i'm going to do with my life when I'm done watching Yoshitsune
i don't care you don't have it, be useful or be silent bye
fucking hate when i post on the fb group of my uni to ask for a specific lesson and people are like "omg i don't have it either"
MDDRRRRRRRRR Bouygues ils ont pété les plombs #lrt
he told Benkei he didn't want to lose one of his vassals again im cryin

sidgyas are disappointed because there's no member-gya tshirts...

if Yoshitsune cries one more time consider me dead though
idk how no one has reported my account for 'disturbing daily spazzing over old men' yet but well wwww
done with british civilization... guess i get the right to watch episode 33..
#timetomutenaam

@isshi11 LMAO if she means he is the Alpha gay then she's totally right and I approve of this
@isshi11 I don't know what she's trying to say but I rofled 8'DDDDD
comment of the year:
(about aki and his gay sticker) 
the hunger games is so real seriously i can't even
@yukimeru IKR STOP DOING THAT PEOPLE.
japanese words can mean everything and their contrary so context is important T_T
someone just posted a "happy birthday tackey" post in the takki tag omg......... how to tell her she's one month late
i hate when people give you like 3 words in japanese and ask you to translate like even with a 12k words context it might still be confusing
@KazeNoChou mmhhhhh once again I can't compare with German but there is actually a fuckton of exceptions in French XD
these two are everything 
lmao these truths why am i so cancer #LRT
like if i were in a band and broke up i'd feel deeply sorry for the fans who dedicated so much love and time
I don't know if I'm too bitter and intolerant but whenever a band is breaking up I also expect apologies to come with the gratitude
大好きなメンバーと大好きな音楽を
真っ直ぐやり続けたこの6年を誇りに思ってる

僕達の最後を見届けてくれたみんな
来れないけど気持ちをくれてた全国のファンの人達
応援してくれた戦友達、関係者の方々
全てに感謝 
本当にありがとう。。。
本当にありがとうございました。
@KazeNoChou Oh maybe, I have no clue about German xD
oh Aki's new bass mmh i really dislike sunburst model guitars but okay, i wonder what it sounds like
A good advice for learning French grammar rules:

Everything is an exception.
Good luck.
@yukimeru of courseeee you are my alpha brazilian Gabiii &lt;3

@KokoroKira ahh yes true XD well thank you the movie then XDD
@KokoroKira he appears in the main legend (in fact I wonder if he isn't more famous than Yoshitsune himself XD) but since these are tales...
@KokoroKira his vassal, in fact he was monstrous as a fighter and when Yoshitsune beat him once Benkei decided to serve him XD
@KokoroKira oh yeah I guess that's true love XDDD 
Apparently Yosh could get all the vagina he wanted though so he has no excuse either? XD
@kokoroKira HAHAHAHA glad to see I'm not the only one who can't choose XDDDDDD
#thedilemmaofpoligamy

@gosailthesea omg yes consider all possibilities
and right now my brain is so confused omg my love for Yoshitsune knows no bounds but it's clashing with my Aki feels XD
I might have a harem of husbandos but I can only have one #1
@gosailthesea im cryin are you going to give him that too
@KokoroKira Hahahaha it was, I didn't imagine there were fanfics about them tbh XD
@KokoroKira I guess that since they had to go to battles for long whiles they couldn't see their girls so they had to find another mean.. XD
@KokoroKira We don't know, even Benkei might have not actually existed tbh so... XDDDDDD
you bet my son's second name will be Yoshitsune i dont even care
@KokoroKira Hahahahha I saw it on FB XDDDDD
@KokoroKira Yeah, there are gay legends on Yosh' and Benkei though XDDD Since he was his ~main~ vassal
i want to watch the Dan no Ura battle tomorrow but i'm really excited right now???
the music was too epic in this episode
@KokoroKira ((Tsugunobu is Yoshitsune's vassal btw xDDDD))
@KokoroKira - so I'm ready to give it up for you, I'll follow you no matter what" and it was so cute i'm dead T____T
@KokoroKira HAhahahha ahhh no it's not what you imagined but he was like "I learnt to cherish life thanks to you -
should i watch another episode ??????
idk it's 2am and i'm already about to have a stroke because of the young lord
He is SO fucking precious oh my god my heart is about to burst into flames
I want to cup his head under the moonlight and tell him that everything is gonna be alright
マジで天使(╥_╥)(╥_╥)(╥_╥)(╥_╥)
義経様(╥_╥)(╥_╥)大好き(╥_╥)<BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT> 
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO SLICE YOUR LIMBS BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO CRY
HE'S SO CUTE WHEN HE'S UPSET SEND HELP 
EVERY TIME I THINK I CAN'T LOVE YOSHITSUNE MORE BUT MY LOVE INCREASES AS SECONDS PASS
IM DYING THIS EPISODE WAS SO AKNSDJKEBGJFBRGKB H B
EDJKNFJRNEJB I KNEW IT THERE WAS THIS SCENE WHERE TSUGUNOBU CONFESSED ALL HIS GAY FEELINGS TO YOSHITSUNE AND OF COURSE HE'LL DIE FUCK YOU
oN THE OTHER HAND YOSHITSUNE IN SAMURAI CLOTHING MAKES UP FOR ALL THE DEATHS dkenjgndjgbjrg
before you die: even though you are a Heike i love you Tomomori you were an awesome person rip
strangely i can sing along to songs i don't even remember listening to <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> The T&amp;T fever is too strong lol
sorry vk bands i'm too busy looping Tackey&amp;Tsubasa's albums to listen to your new music
*grabs popcorn while waiting for the comments pretending that Aki is a straight virgin unicorn*
someone posted a pic of aki's bass sticker "it's ok to be gay" on fb (this happened in 2007 but whatever) i'm just gonna sit there and wait
Vanner les clandestins : Charlie 
Vanner les feujs : pas très Charlie 
Vanner Charlie : pa…
ok there was a tornado not very far from here literally wtf is wrong with the weather today
obama's part was funny too omg
ive watched cecily's full remark and i'm dying idk what's funnier her jokes or the constipated faces of those white conservatives porks
"your hair is so white now it can talk back to the police" is probably the best sentence that has been pronounced this year
my favourite thing in the whole world is the embarrassed face white people make after not laughing when a joke about racism happens
gotcharocka new album fuck yesss tbh

楽しみにしててね♬ 
Tegoshi looks like he's fallen from heaven in this program though omg
/not as angelic as my blonde boo though
lol Aki once went eating out with Yuuya Tegoshi XDD
maybe he even hangs out with Takki who knows lololol
Shinsama's been tweeting a lottttt today :o
"早速一部で解散だの、脱退だの騒がれてるみたいだけどあり得ないよ"
I still consider this a promise you made and I will cling to these words for the time being.
i commented on his post this day saying "Aki please do not disappoint us okay" lmao wow
i'm still mad @ the "お騒がせしてます（笑）" after he announced his solo like THANK YOU FOR THE STROKE DONT WORRY FOR ME DUH
lmao i'm going through aki's fb posts in december and i haven't liked any of his statuses i think i was raging very hard omg
ツアー！！！！！！
@0329t_t とてもかっこいいです！（＾ω＾）
実はジャニーズとかあまり好きじゃなかったが、ドラマでタッキーさんが好きになりました(≧◡≦)
何てお呼びすればいいですか？
ちなみに日本人ではないので、日本語の色々な間違いをしてすみません＞＜
@0329t_t フォロバありがとうございます(^^)/
私もタッキーさんが好きです！よろしくお願いします♪
,,, he's on my profile picture too LOL
sometimes i forget things
lol i just was hunting Takki fan accounts and went all "waw she has him as her profile picture, must be such a fan" and then i realised.....
あぁ呼吸が乱れてしまいそう…
本当カッコイイ<DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK>︎<DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK>︎
なんなのこの美しさ(´；Д；｀)<TWO HEARTS>
美、そのもの。
あぁ見惚れる。。
桜さえも滝様の美しさに恐縮してるように見えるだよ。笑 
can't hear くろ without immediately thinking of Yoshitsune now what is life www
@toromahepon haha I keep the plastic wraps too or when I don't have it I just keep the obi on the cd
@KazeNoChou hahaha srlsy i hate when they do that -_-
The film of play was the weirdest shit ever though I can't even <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The booklets of Play were really cool, too--  /flails at Aki being a sexy pirate/
"World tour" Big Bang pls I didn't know Asia was the world, thanks
1st confirmed dates &amp; cities @ 
#BIGBANGMADE #MADETOUR 
What's with everyone not caring about the obi in CDs I'd glue it to my CDs if I could
((But SenMachi tour setlists were dhakdkzkqbslqjs so idk ;;))
If I could go back in time and attend only one tour of them I think I'd go for play tour
In fact I love everything revolving about "play" because the whole atmosphere they created around it is amazing
It's been months and he still forgets to attach the picture Yuuya pls wwwwwwww 

/I love Play's jacket too/
オレこのジャケット好きだわぁ。 #PLAY
IT'S ALWAYS TIME FOR YUUYANYAN FEELS

ただ、そんな気がする
soon there'll be a trigger warning for the word trigger &amp; the world will turn into a giant mindfuck while i'll be hiding in aki's bald anus
like how do these people even live if they can't stand the sight of eyes
i saw a post on tumblr with an eyes trigger warning i don't know what to think anymore
i could be doing so many things related to Yoshitsune instead of reading about goddamn economy right now
Con of college: you can skip class.

@voxteiru Sagaaaaaaaaa idk what you're doing with your life but you're clearly doing it wrong if you're not heading to london right now!!
omgg <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

"負けたら泣く"

omg this bae
モウリーニョに一度も勝った事がない
今夜こそ勝ちたい
負けたら泣く
Yoshitsune basically :( 
We don't know his birthday but I'm personally convinced Yoshitsune was an Aquarius
I dreamt that I was smoking chocolate-flavor weed...... What
She immediately said YEAH HE IS BEAUTIFUL when I showed her Aki's latest pic though wwwww she doesn't want me rambling aw
My mom doesn't find Takki beautiful what the heck mom
@petenshimachine Ohhh you're right dear D: then you can do that, or pretend you're lesbian 8)
@petenshimachine 
idk how people can get their eyebrows done at the salon i'd kill the bitch if she messed up my eyebrow game
there was a time when talking about butts and $$ didn't automatically make you a rapper sigh where have the good rappers gone
même ma grand mère elle a plus de flow que vous mdrr putain j'ai honte pour vous
les gars qui croient qui sont doués en rap juste parce qu'ils habitent dans un quartier vous méritez j'vous crève l'oeil avec ma canine
the thing Yoshitsune does with his sleeves when he sits makes me mentally pass out every time
Aki will have a good fashion sense when I'll be able to spell Schwarzenegger properly 
#inotherwordsnever
like what you're seeking for is only material, not experiences.
i'm sorry you don't have anything to love other than objects
I feel sorry for those whose dreams of the future are only related to luxury cars, big houses and expensive brand clothing
i don't know if i should watch Yoshitsune since i'm home???
i don't want mom to hear me scream about Takki's jaws it's embarrassing
I'm not the type whose feelings go away with time so even though I don't talk to you for months my feelings will remain unchanged~
@gosailthesea yeah that definitely would be great
@gosailthesea yeah i'm wishing so much that you'll get to see him in person it'll be so much funnier
i'm shocked because she acted pretty nice to me the only time we talked together lmao bitch knows who she shouldn't fuck with?? good
apparently there's this girl at uni who's been a pretentious little shit with everyone saying she was the best omg
@gosailthesea lmaoooooo it'll be worth it in the end
@gosailthesea god bless you
@yukimeru Mao is precious T_T &lt;3
europe: *takes all ressources in africa*
europe: why the fuck do they come here and take our jobs
@yukimeru the way he moves his body is crayyyyy though
@yukimeru I KNOW RIGHT HE SAID IT WAS おいしい 565468 TIMES I CANT XDD
i ate so much chocolate i'm feeling sick hahahaha i missed this sensation
naaaaaaam pls work faster so you can see your 御曹司 todayyy
@gosailthesea hahaha at least he doesn't wear the same shit everyday (looking at you bald anus)
@gosailthesea lmaoo what makes you say this? 
i think he looks too cute with a hat
Mao is everything &lt;3
Cutie <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT> 
@yukimeru yeah i know.. it kinda scares me too ://
strangely i still hate on my boo 5 months after he announced his solo project but i can hold no grudge against the nyan XD
@yukimeru @voxteiru idk the way they explained it in the broadcast made me accept the thing a bit more :// though im still not convinced
@yukimeru @voxteiru omg excuse me while i rofl at this
@yukimeru yeah but it's not like he'll do activities himself, he'll just be giving a chance to new talents so idk ;A;??
@yukimeru aww baby you're here!
i don't know if i can rage against nyan since i blindly trust him but idk what to think about this??
@Cara_puce EXPLDDRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR OMG
@1103ids おおお！ナルニアのアスランなのwwww

#stopYuuya2k15 
i'll turn 19 soon and i still have this undying love for Athrun Zala from when i was 9.

@1103ids アスランとは…このアスラン？？ 
Nyan is so cuteeeeeeeeeeekdnkjfbjbfvjbj
depending on how well it works it can do something very awesome though, i'll be looking forward to the broadcasts in june
Nyan presenting his project while insisting loudly on how delicious the okonomiyaki was i cannot <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
alrighttt i will watch the broadcast to see what's up with nyan
@voxteiru 私もなにこれって思ったw is the aidoru fever getting all of them one after another omg wut
@voxteiru look at thisssss 
he'll produce some dancing vk bandmen???
i see no one is reacting to Nyan's new activites why is this 
/feels lonely
the Mao =&gt; producer thing can't sink in though omg
i hope his project doesn't flop though.. ? 
idk i just find the concept a bit weird
Nyannnn, will always be supporting you <BLACK HEART SUIT>

今までに無いものを作るって、凄く難しく大変なことかもしれない。だからこそわくわく感も半端ない。

おれを育ててくれたヴィジュアル系ってジャンルに、少しでも恩返しできるようなプロジェクトにしていきたい！

…
some people study arabic culture, philosophy, or anthropology in our uni.... it's a useful book for them,,, literally what thefuck
oh my god someone shared the Quran on our uni fb page and people started yelling it was islamic propaganda i want to puke
マオくんがプロデューサーかぁ。イメージとしては、ASAYANみたいなのかな？どんな感じか不安もあるけど、応援する～(*´▽｀)ﾉﾉ #イケVプロジェクト htt…
I'm also worried about him starting other activities too but I blindly trust Mao to the point it's ridiculous so this shouldn't be a problem
like it does sound cool but the vk dance thing??????
ok i missed the broadcast so i'll watch later but mao's new project omg???,, im so confused
新しいアー写になって、盛り上がってますね！ #いつもサンキュ
OMG I SAW THAT AND I WAS SO CONFUSED AT FIRST AND NOW IM DEAD THESE GUYS ARE A++ 
omgggg he was finally appointed for the battle in the south so i guess next episode will finally be Dan no Ura battle?? <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
IM FALLING IN LOVE MORE AT EACH EPISODE help
the truth is i think i love Masako she was an admirable woman and wife but i still don't get what she felt about Yoshitsune
i don't know why they took such an old, ugly actress to play Lady Tango though? wasn't she a beautiful famous courtesan
Yoshitsune be like "no one told me the emperor was a pedophile help" omg im dying 
give the guy a beautiful death and let him rest in goddamn peace i don't like this type of fanservice
mangas where dead characters come back to life disgust me
義経殿の生まれた場所に行きたいな
京都に早く行きたい
also i'm trying so hard to hate his bae Shizuka but she's TOO CUTe fak.
i considered that he might not have been very smart but i actually think he was, he was brillant in battles after all
i hate how he was so kindheared and naive that he didn't notice everyone was using him <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
i had to take a break from that episode because he's just too precious every mL of oxygen he breathes out is perfect 
/cries @ Yoshitsune
((I think about maths a lot when I'm walking))
@ dumb boys in the street if I'm smiling randomly it's not for you I probably just mentally solved an equation
if you think i'm not going to complain to aki about ending the outsider tour with "memai" you're very wrong
i just told him i wasn't really fond of midnight kyousou darling because this song is very much useless please don't do that again
I'm just miserably unable to tell him straight that I dislike a song though
It's not because it's him but it must be hard as an artist
i was so dying to tell him i couldnt get a single word of FREAK SHOW before reading the booklet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
the 好き aren't directed to him though, i'm just telling him what i loved/or not about his album
i'm writing a long long message to bald anus after a long time and i already can't count all the 好き in it ew
@voxteiru U COME TOO OK KRIS I'LL BE TOO BUSY TALKING W/ MESSI ANYWAY <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
maybe we can even invite Messi and hold an afterparty together and-----
/nop
it'd be cool if saga did an event on his bday when i'm in japan someday lel i'd go just to feel the 24th june spiritual connection <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
でも世界中のみんなが参加できるような何かはやるよ。
en fait je crois que la plupart de ma promo est fan des johnny's mais ne connaissent pas Takki tant mieux bye
@yukimeru and Yuuya looks like he took that picture during his break on a kpop clip shooting?? i dont understand anymore
personally i'm more than alright with what they do now, they have their own style (and they never fully left vk to me)
Someone will have to explain to me why is everyone going "omgei they're going back to being vk" when SID wears a little more makeup ???
@KazeNoChou indeed
@yukimeru AHA dedicate this tweet to you, queen of Reituki
@QueenSaraBiatch hahah pareil je remonte plus dans les ascenseurs moi
Ruki and Reita 
@QueenSaraBiatch parce qu'on avait regardé trop de vidéos d'accidents d'ascenseurs du coup on a rigolé nerveusement pendant 50 étages <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@QueenSaraBiatch Sara tu te rappelles quand on a pris l'ascenseur au Government Building de Shinjuku et qu'on a flippé nos races <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't know if I should spend the night watching Yoshitsune or watch a Takki Kabuki ????
i've been torn between "i want new SID stuff!!!!!!" and "Nyan pls rest!!!!" for the past year ugh i hate it
@Sushikasuki @SIDWonderFrench Bof perso j'espère pas tellement, j'aurais préféré que Mao se repose encore mais bon.. xD
@Sushikasuki @SIDWonderFrench En général ils changent de look après l'annonce par contre &gt;&lt; Mais bon on sait jamais~~
i don't want anyone to see my lips like this and ask how i did that
love when people think im wearing red lipstick cause im dating someone when no it's just that i destroyed my lips and it's only blood now
I can't believe my babu fought for his smelly ass and he did the opposite of rewarding him
Yoritomo and his wife are such pieces of shit I hate them both fucking rot in hell
so i'm gonna have to emtpy my brain of everything related to japanese til 12 may
I feel like I'm failing at everything I do lately...
baby bird you will be missed
as expected they forgot to update aki's profile picture on instagram lol LOL
oKEY I GOTTA LEAVE FOR THAT GODDAMN EXAM KEEP . ME . UPDATED OK
i'd really like to have a talk with the person who did Mao's makeup though
lmaooo i saved the picture on my computer and it was named "bg" on their site which basically means ikemen in french im dead
they usually announce the release way before revealing the picture so ???
i don't understand that thing though why are they changing their picture while there's no release????
IM CRYING AHAHAHAHAHHAAH GUYS I LOVE YOU
SHINJI HAS BEEN LOOKING THE SAME SINCE 2004 BYE
YUUYA LOOKS LIKE A GUY FROM A KPOP BOYSBAND IM CRYING
Nyan looks so aggressive????? lel
BUT IS THERE A NEW SINGLE OR SOMETHING ?? I SEE NOTHING

Bon j'vais regarder un épisode de l'amour de ma vie Yoshitsune parce que j'suis grave en manque là
the thing i love here is that even our law/economy profs don't consider us like crap even though it's not our major
i also noticed how SNOB the teachers are in medical studies oh god they have such a big ego
very well, i do not intend to give a single penny to your shit country anyway, i'll fly away as soon as possible bye
we're basically considered as useless crap that will not contribute to the country
though it is true that as a former medical student i do see the big difference between medical and languages degrees
excuse me but when musicology will cure diseases please do call me
a student at uni legit told me it was unfair that the government gave more money for medical degrees than musicology degrees
@Starry_Snow aww i see, well maybe they only make available degrees that will be useful in your country XD
@isshi11 omgggggggg how could you, ENAMEL is da masterpiece of the century ;A;
I want to go to Marseille~~
i need beachhhhh
SID will start their tour right on the beginning on my finals week hahaha nice nice /jumps off a bridge
@Starry_Snow Ohh I see haha but didn't you study Japanese?
@Starry_Snow Seriously ?! o_o How do people study languages then ?
person: do you prefer older men
me: ..............
me: let's not talk about this
@cookiekakumei mmh après on refait tellement ce qu'on a fait en oral que c'est limite le même cours du coup j'y suis allée 3 fois ce semstre
@Starry_Snow I'm at Aix-Marseille University ! (we don't have a specific name for our uni, so it's just the city name haha)
@cookiekakumei vous avez quoi comme matières? o_o En même temps ça sert pas à grand chose sérieux xD
i haven't watched Yoshitsune in 3 days no wonder i'm in physical pain
@cookiekakumei labo (je sais pas si vous avez ça aussi mais en gros c'est des écoutes)
i wonder if i'd be getting the same grades in big language schools such as the inalco lel
i still wonder if my uni is shitty and that's why japanese is so ~easy~ here but i know it's quite known for its language degrees so idk
@cookiekakumei Merciii T_T Dernier partiel de japonais demain xD
i really love being in this uni with so many foreign students tbh they're all so cute
foreigners are so cute when they tell you a word in their mother tongue and you say it a few days later and they get so excited omg
I will go get myself some milk and Oreo bye
As for my Japanese test this morning idk,,,, I didn't have any major problem but I'm so scared of making stupid mistakes as usual
Today was my last day of class I can't believe it tbh
MISTER T. HAHAHAHAHA OMG PLS
1人は水浴びをして1人は草を食べていたので、どうやら人違いでしょう(◔ิ з◔ิ)

you guys should fucking chill god forbid we spill hot chocolate on ourselves it might be a way to imitate your skin who knows
i was waiting for the black girls to yell "cultural appropriation!!!!" about the kylie jenner challenge bullshit and it happened omg why
(Look at me trying to avoid studying grammar)
truth is I fucking miss high school it was so funny hdlsjdldbamdjzpdb I laughed harder in a day than I laughed this year at school
Like it's funnier to talk to your former classmates like "remember when we all failed that test haha" lel nostalgic
This might be weird but those moments are the funniest moments which I remember of school after all
We were all like "it's ok bro we all failed" lmao
The faces of my classmates after the history test were priceless though for the first time I felt a true sense of unity
I'm literally one of the most stressed person about our exams at uni when I'm one of the only ones who already know I'll pass this year wut
@cookiekakumei omg sérieux ;;-;; c'est chaud quand même ça...
Je voulais juste vous annoncer que je viens de faire une accolade de bg. 

#lesjalouxvontmaigrir
that reminds me my own mama's birthday is this weekend ahh i'll have to come back home for this at least
(( i mean, as a 1st year student lmao , my level in japanese is probably the one of a 6 months old child ))
I know my thing when it comes to Japanese but my ultimate phobia is THE ONE WORD IN THE TEXT YOU DON'T KNOW OMG
i've lost all confidence in myself and yet i must have 30/20 tomorrow if i want to compensate for today's disaster in history
When I say Takki is the most beautiful human I've ever seen I'm not joking you don't understand omg

@yourregulargen thank youuu &lt;3

i had a good idea to change the title of my blog and i forgot it omg
PERFECTION PERFECTION PERFECTION

@cookiekakumei bof je me suis un peu ratée au final XDDDD Mais merci (^^)/
I'm such a failure at life orz I fucked up at my test. Messed up a stroke in the kanji 借 and forgot how to write 授業 I want to stab myself TT

If I don't make it alive through this week though one of you guys must go meet Aki for me and tell him I want one of his nipples in my grave
Finals starting from today... 
I hope god can bless me with a brain just like he did when he gave Aki those adorable cheeks.

ツイッターでは、日本語で長い長いツイートをよく書けるけど英語で3つの言葉は長すぎて入れない（笑）うざい
I AM SO STRESSED FOR TOMORROW OMG KILL ME NOW
it kills me how you can write an essay on twitter in japanese but fitting 4 words in a tweet in english is a real struggle
@rokettochikubi Aaah probably just stare at his little face then pinch his baby cheeks and say "is okay, you aren't badass enough anyway ♡"
@rokettochikubi Only Yuuya must know about it, right right.
focusing on japanese is too hard when every single word reminds you of a song XD
me: doing homework
me: sees "一人では"
me: screams "遠い明日を"
/leaves
@koohii_mame i knowww but i could do like Mulan and pretend i'm a boy XDD
@voxteiru i don't know i thought it'd be funny to picture me drinking myself (literally) to death :'D
i imagined what it'd be like if my blood tasted like oreo and honestly i doubt i'd still be here to talk about it
@gosailthesea lmao totally
My skin smells like sugar?? Even my clothes??? All the time? There must be sugar flooding in my veins omg
It's crazy though because this little fucker is talented in everything he does ugh sparkly prince you are insultingly perfect
But hey Takki said he had no particular talent so he became a Johnny's maybe I should become a Johnny's too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I wish I had at least that sigh
People with self confidence: cherish it
trop de nostalgie quand j'repense à la primaire c'était les plus belles années de mon existence ptn
n'empêche j'aimais bien leslie elle chantait bien elle était pas vulgaire c'était la belle époque

youtube suggested me a iggy azalea clip and seriously her whole existence offends me oh my god

なんかキングダムハーツのおかげで日本のことに興味にあり始めた

especially since i was not at all the kind of student who used to pressure myself about grades idk what's happening to me
i've been going by the motto "if i don't get a 20/20 i might as well dig a hole and die in it" all year but this actually induces stress
im so anxious about my japanese finals im going to die
@soiyya_sa110 キングダムハーツ？？(((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))
@isshi11 i did the same with aki i was replying to everything with my weabooish-japanese omg <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

les gens que j'connais irl qui m'ont sur twitter c'est des élus en vrai la plupart du temps je dis que j'ai pas twitter mdrr
like. didn't you figure out that he took showers sometimes.
i love people who went mousou because shun mentionned in his tweet that aki was taking a shower.
i just realised T.M.R will release his album the day after I'm done with my finals (and this year of uni) &lt;3
and now they want to leave again lmao UK pls get your shit together we don't have time for your shit
it's basically about how these little shits refused to join the UE and finally wanted to after they saw it'd be interesting
i can't believe i thought studying great britain history would be more interesting than america ew

THE END IS NEAR MY FRIENDS
you know it's finals time when you can't eat on your table because there are papers full of kanji everywhere
meanwhile i'm still secretly praying for a FMA movie about what happened after the conqueror of shamballa but
Akito doesn't even have a fine ass, really what's the point :////////////
and it's supposedly about what was going on in france during that time oho well it was just me crying because of rolo if you want the truth
but it would be a bit illogical so i'd say during??
the thing i still don't get is : is the ova taking place during the anime or after the anime
if it's after i'm going to kill the writer
@gosailthesea people like me who loved the anime but i still don't get why they're doing these ovas it has no point
like. perfectly flawless.
nothing tops Code Geass' ending.
nothing.
i watch them 'cause i'm thirsty for new code geass stuff but if i'm honest they should've stopped after 2nd season which was perfect
oh the preview for Code Geass 3rd ova is out lol and i still don't get the point of it
MY FRENCH SELF APPROVES OF THIS A+++++ TAKKI COME HERE <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
when i think about it though it's comforting to think if i accidentally ended up in 1180 in japan i'd have a man to love and have my babies
like it would be cool if it wasn't right after Heian which is literally the best era
i mean it's not like it's uninteresting but ACTUALLY YES IT IS OMG NOTHING HAPPENS IM SO BORED IM GOING TO DIE
if i see "Yoshitsune" one more time in this book i'm burning it it's already hard enough to care about Kamakura ok

i also found a video where i believe he's saying "hello lady do you want to sleep with me tonight" lolol pls

it's like when i hear this CM in which Gackt speaks french it makes me crack up every time <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
even Aki doesn't reach his level of embarrassing
((that means a lot))
i have no idea when Gackt uploaded his current profile picture but LMAO WHAT IS THIS THING
i was reading that book about fucking kamakura as planned but it talked about Jien so i ended up reading stuff about Yoshitsune?? hOWWWWW
lol i just realised what i was doing i am the most unbelivable person in the fucking world
he's saying it like Yoshitsune voluntarily chose to turn himself against Yoritomo lol bruh do you remember who killed who
omg im reading the gukanshô written by Jien and he's so biased towards Yoritomo????, suck his dick while you're at it
Oh hey Dir en Grey it had been awhile since I last needed you.
like it's the most perfect human alive playing the most perfect dead human mmmmmmmmmmmmmh why this
it hurts even more now that i have affection for Takki too because i'm dying over BOTH Yoshitsune AND Takki jfc
hE IS SO INSULTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WHEN HE DRESSES UP LIKE THAT I WANT TO STAB MYSELF
wow nice, thanks for destroying my soul (^_^)

and i thought i was the most self-centered and narcissistic shit lmao
im on the phone with my friend and she's making me so motherfucking mad jfc i need my whole collection of aki's screenshots
i can only imagine how much work he has especially since Noblesse got really popular (it was dumb to start another manwha tho)
the author of Noblesse was so stressed that he got ill and no chapter has been out for a long while omg poor him ;_;
i can't consider myself an adult though i'm still 13 years old for me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
sometimes i see the people my age acting around me and go "why are they trying to act so adult lol"
and then i realise. i'm an adult.
so 856 years old is definitely too old :/

@gosailthesea ok man i'm convinced i'll watch this when i'm done with my yoshitsune spazzing
@gosailthesea is the ost good?? the anime seems very good so it's on my list but idk for the ost
i hate how i'm always so damn sleepy from 6pm to 8pm like i can do nothing without feeling sleepy but i cant fucking sleep ugh
a fan commented on aki's picture "naked? but doesn't it feel cold? like, when you go to the bathroom etc.." i'm fuckin dying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

are they going to update takichannel today omg but i loved this vid of him eating soba why did no one record it T___T
but then he went "nah it's not you i just tripped and hurt myself" so i was like "ah ok alright then :'D" omg im inhuman
i was opening the door of my residence and after i walked in a boy appeared with his knee bleeding so i was like OMG I DIDNT HOLD THE DOOR
sometimes i realise how monstruous i am and wonder how i even started medical studies lmao
@yukimeru hAHAHAH it's because it'd have become an endless rambling if i had started D:
But I can't fully immerse myself in Japanese if engrish keeps interfering in my brain
(Like I worked on it before lmao lmao lmao)
I've taken my decision, after my English finals in May I'll stop working on it til December 2015 lol I really have no choice
The worst is that I actually did start writing a long tag about it but i stopped and decided to write that instead www #LRT
@yukimeru WWWWWW OMG YOU !!! (Can't deny it though 8DDDD)
The only thing that keeps me going to class now is that classes end next week because omg
Me: *laughs at friend's new obsession for a boxer*
Friends: you're in love with a guy who died 800 years ago Naam. 

Ok. 
Ok. 
Okokok.
If my friends had left 10 min before I could've watched an episode of Yoshitsune I'm so mad
"Sorry for being late but have you seen my eyeliner game"
I can live without Aki's "too-hot-for-y'all-bitches" mode but pls never stop being a cute shy dork it's exactly why my 心belong to you ♡///♡
I-- would like to be a part of this 裸で-wrapped-up-in-the-futon party too.
Oh I misread his post (Naam pls wake up properly before reading what the bald anus has to say) lol Aki then don't complain after that www
@rokettochikubi ahhhhh glad to read that !!
I was just paranoid then wwwww
I hope he didn't actually catch a cold though, he's always sick , damn :(((
@AERIE_Y yeah it was very short unfortunately ;;;; same here <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
The moment when your boo makes you go "oy fck you bald anus"

@rokettochikubi Fairy Shinji..... this sounds way too beautiful
@voxteiru oMG ARE U KIDDING ME HAHAHAHAHHA IM DEAD POOR BB (he must have been happy tho?)

the awkward moment when you find out all the vocabulary in your textbook has been gathered in a table at the end of the book...
i have a japanese mock exam tomorrow and i havent studied  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
the moment when your eyeliner is so pretty you don't want to take it off before sleeping
@voxteiru ああああああ I so imagine that omgei

@rokettochikubi HAHAHA I'm sorryyyyyy I wasn't trying to kill you ://
OMG IM NOT USUALLY HAPPY WITH WOMEN GETTING HIT BUT THE INHUMAN HAPPY SCREAM I MADE WHEN YOSHINAKA SLAPPED TOMOE BLESS
i cant believe i made that 
@rokettochikubi yES NYAN'S FACE ENDS ME CAUSE IT'S LIKE "i just tripped before 3000 people do you think i'm ok asshole bye"
Aki's adorable face when he went to check out if Nyan was okay though i cannotnkdbgjrebbh
@rokettochikubi *symbolically picks you up* 
@rokettochikubi 8'DDDDDDD if this is the real reason, I gladly accept it
/pictures the suck-at-Mario-kart married couple/
oMG I ALWAYS SUCK AT ENGLISH BUT IM BREAKING THE WORLD'S RECORD TONIGHT WTF
thinking about Aki and Mario Kart, considering how much he sucks he must takes 78 weeks to finish the Rainbow Road ?
@rokettochikubi I'll have to teach them how to play Mario Kart though, because there's no way my kids don't end up 1st at the MUSHROOM CUP
@rokettochikubi oH GOD THESE PICTURES /dies instantly
the third one indicates an about-to-throw-kimchi alert
i'm so not going to do my english homework and will watch yoshitsune instead goodbye
@rokettochikubi he iiiisss ! 
wish we could be emo together, living the emo life and have emo kids 8'D
do you remember when Misha Collins made a video about shipping destiel because i do
i must say it though i have many people i love but Aki will always own my heart and soul ok remember this
/suddenly emo
@voxteiru yeahhh hahahaha i will be a mess when i'm 80 years old omgei
ahhh right right! probably 8) ? would be somewhat cute
the worst is i was talking about my officially-known-boo (aka bald anus) so she has no excuse ;;
i realized i loved too many people when this morning i was talking to my friend about my "baby" and she said "which one" lmao pls
@voxteiru i wish this wasn't my case but-- but ;A;
/looks at harem of all my bfs piling up as years pass
this is totally not me right right???  
@__LilyCarroll WHAT ARE COMPLIMENTS IF THEY DON'T COME FROM OUR FAV BANDMEN ANYWAY LOLOL 
/runs away
@__LilyCarroll "enjoy" ? wut, bruh pls.
compliments are fine if they're said in a polite way but catcalling is seriously so rude
@__LilyCarroll Lolllll guys need to get their dick cut off if they can't control it seriously -__-
@__LilyCarroll ikrrrrrrrrr it's super insulting imo i hate it ;A;
and when it's a group you can't even insult them
her translations are so motherfucking weird it's like she's still living in middle age
im so worried for next week's test cause it'll be with the other grammar teacher and i'm not used to her sigh
personally i don't like the feeling of being seen as a walking vagina but ok go ahead
i just saw a girl saying being catcalled felt nice mmh ok you're either a super attention whore ++ or you dont get what they mean
i think the most precious thing i have from this semester's history classes is my recording of my prof telling Yoshitsune's story <BLACK HEART SUIT>
im struggling so hard with english right now it literally takes me a minute to find one word (i just forgot how to say 'shadow' bye)
(though i'd probably be lame and spend my life drawing aki's nose but whatever)
if i could draw how much do you bet there would be fanarts of yuuya stroking mao's hair all over the internet
Yuuyan pls go get Nyan some croissants and bring him breakfast in bed since you're already up
寝まくったからスーパー早起き
@Starry_Snow yeahh i tried to look up for takki's stuff but there's NOTHING on youtube, those johnny's are quite wild huh
so there's this bassist-kai tonight but i don't see aki in the pictures why why how could you not invite my boo
@gosailthesea niceee i'll try next time with other bands
@gosailthesea pants sounds illogical to me but i memorized it but saying "my hair IS" is so hard for me omg
@gosailthesea works for japanese songs too ? omg
Why is hair singular anyway we have fucking millions of hair
I think if there's one thing in my life I'll never get right it's that "hair" is a singular word in english
I'm so mad when people ask if I have extensions like nO THOSE ARE MY HAIR MY CHILD I GREW THEM MYSELF OK
This part of my hair is so flawless I want to kiss it 
Booba d'un côté il a un peu eu raison sur ce qu'il a dit d'un côté lui parler de religion mdr lol okok
@gosailthesea nah but like I had the melody in my mind but I couldn't recall the title or even the lyrics lmao this is the worst
lol sudden need to listen to l'arc's "flower" but couldn't recall what album it was from i had to go trough the whole discography
(j'ai rien contre les llce mais ceux de ma fac sont un peu triso)
j'vais tout faire pour que tous ceux qui partiront en échange en L3 soient des LEA j'men balec la guerre des filières est lancée mdr
mais des trucs genre limite s'il demande au prof comment apprendre ses kanji quoi ptn faut tout leur expliquer à ces gens
après le prof dit que les lea font que pleurer lol j'en ai pas entendu un parler tg
aujourd'hui on a fait une séance bilan avec notre prof référant et omg les llce faisaient que se plaindre jai envie dles claquer
i wasnt listening in the first place
<NEW MOON WITH FACE> 
to grocery shopping or not to grocery shopping...
i don't like getting marks that are even numbers unless it's a 20/20 lol
i mean i call him Fattyshiko but i would never tell him he got fat oh my god i find this super disrespectful
ok some fans commented on aki's picture saying he's put on some weight??? what about you fuck yourself
for my Maogyas who missed the broadcast, i came across this:

what the fuck is even this outfit anyways oh my god aki wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Aki pls not these shoes........... not you
i trusted you
the only reason i'm letting them see only this side of me is cause i need to be considered "psychologically fine" to do the exchange in jp
@voxteiru ahh yes i didn't see the second answer sorry www
yesss it feels like they didn't find their own style huh
it's so hard trying to show your best side to your profs, trying to make them believe studying is the easiest thing for you
prof: so what do you want to do in the future
me: *panics trying to not answer i want to go back in time and marry a dead samurai*
@voxteiru yesss totally! 
+ idk i'm all about giving a chance to new bands so i listen to their preview but it sounds like the others D:
@voxteiru i don't know, i only saw very few bands actually look good in that style because most just look stupid ://
@pietarajuku nonnnnnn compote pomme fraise &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
great amazon is now osusume-ing me SID goods AND Yoshitsune DVDs, bruh do you think i need that
@voxteiru ikrrrrrrr so annoying, the worse is when they also SOUND the same ew where is originality
家主がシャワーを浴びている間にギンと戯れて写真撮った<CAT>
#シュンカメ #ネコ 
hahahaha kenzo pls this cat looks so savage
 
the awkward moment when she asked me something i was good at and the only thing i could think was "lmao nothing im lame bye" though
my japanese oral test went very smoothlyyyy i had an interview alone with the prof this time so it was way better
it's okay though, i love every inch of you even if it's fat &lt;3
idk what you do at the gym because you're still a fattyshiko sweetie 
ビジュアル系バンドって本当礼儀正しい人が多いと思う( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
lol all the trends in japan are about the fine weather
you know you should chill when you're sad cause your friend tells you they'll come to school tomorrow meaning you won't watch yoshitsune
i always end up lying because i don't want to say "none lol i'm a little shit" but if people could avoid this question it'd be nice..
a part of me dies every time one of my classmates asks me how many hours a day i work
@rokettochikubi he DOES omg they should've waited a few months more, praying that it'll still be okay though D:
omgggg cute, Mao is such a respected senpai after all ;A; <BLACK HEART SUIT>
si j'dois déplacer mon boul pour 2h de droit ça va pas le faire
déjà aller à la fac à 20 min de chez moi ça me bande commencez pas hein
askip l'année prochaine on aura des cours à Marseille à cause des travaux est ce que j'ai une tête à avoir le temps pour vos conneries?
@rokettochikubi but the tour starts in.. not even a month ;A;
it might just be me being paranoid though..
@QueenSaraBiatch ah d'accord bon bah j'espère que ça se fera vite ^^
i will forever laugh when i see this gif because it sums up my whole life 
@QueenSaraBiatch ah putain l'horreur ils te l'enlèvent bientôt ?
i must say i'll kinda miss obama he did criticizable shit but he was sassy af
@QueenSaraBiatch omg 19 cm quand même :0
bon bah ça va si c'est pas grave.. ça fait mal? (j'ai jamais eu de kyste xD)
((im sorry for the daily spazzing about my dead warrior but gotta find something to procrastinate before my finals so i can hate myself))
Kiseki too hurt my feelings too much omg "むじゃきなあの瞳だけが この胸を焦がし続ける" ;;;;;;;;;;
涙はあなたのそばで　愛の言葉なんていらない
あなたの笑顔　それだけでいい
omg im reading the lyrics of boku to anata and it's my feelings for Yoshitsune basically <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@jasminvincible putain la même j'en aurais partout moi même les jambes &amp; tout mon ultime rêve c'est un méchant dragon dans l'dos
i haven't studied neither japanese nor english in like 3 months lmao my japanese finals are starting.. tomorrow, nice
@rokettochikubi wishing you a speedy recovery for your voice! D:
I don't know, I just found it sound kinda... fragile (?)
Me: cant, contemplatin surrealism and the abstract concept of thought
Bae: my parents arent here
Me: is anyone…
@rokettochikubi yah but being nervous before public appearances is normal for the Nyan ne D: ahhh I hope
@rokettochikubi Ohhh no, I hope you're feeling better now? ;;
かわいい。 
@rokettochikubi couldn't help imagining things about how dark he looked ://///
@rokettochikubi hahahaha did you find him totally normal in that broadcast though ?
I'm going to turn into the modern Lady Shizuka and sing songs about how much I'm longing for my lord Yoshitsune 

/no
the two previous options were fine but still quite painful so whY DID I FALL IN LOVE WITH A DEAD PERSON WHY
Loving a bandman is ok cause you can go to his lives and send him messages on social medias and fan letters
Loving a fictional character is fine cause you can see him in shows (and buy dakimakura of him)
@QueenSaraBiatch qu'est ce que t'as au ventre ? :0 J'espère que c'est pas grave ?
The thing is that it destroys me because it's literally YOSHITSUNE'S VOICE SO ITS LIKE OHMYGOD STOP
This would be a perfect ending song for my movie about Yoshitsune omg (if I don't kill myself when he dies)
You literally have no idea about how T&amp;T's song 花華〜僕とあなた kills me I want to sit with Yoshitsune under the moonlight and pat his head ;;
I'm having fun 8DDD 
@cookiekakumei bien sur que non ça me dérange pas :D 
Mon pseudo est le même que sur twitter ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
@cookiekakumei ohhh d'accord je savais pas je viens de le voir dans l'app LINE :0 c'est trop bien ;;-;;
My first test wwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
