A episode of Shameless to sooth the soul.
"I know but..." - Women
@joannes_ ain't disagreeing there.

@joannes_ <MEMO><MEMO>.
Everybody out here trying to look as good as they can I'm just still here handing out compliments.
LoL gotdamn.
Once I hear the word racks in a R&amp;B song I skip it because I ain't even about to spend that on me.
Ain't no track that you can play these days that situational like that no more any way.
Niggas need to get their heartbroken.
All these new R&amp;B niggas want to do is fuck another nigga bitch or fuck her that one night. That's cool &amp; all.
Son Shaggy was giving some terrible advice if we being real.
You be moving like you in a music video until you knock something over &amp; break it. Now you just mad &amp; sad.
Ever felt like if you sang a song hard enough that one good time that they would feel some type of guilt &amp; just be like aight?
Singing feel good R&amp;B only feel good for about 20 minutes until you play a track that gets you in yo "Damn..." Mode.
Not no sad shit, just feel like singing.
I'm in a R&amp;B mood.

<WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>üèæ RT @40oz_VAN: Can't fuck with her if we don't have similar taste in music or she isn't trying to get put on.
@GrubHub Lmao we'll see.
When you use Grub Hub &amp; the wait is almost an hour &amp; a half. 
Not even going to bother.





@Official_TevinJ Yo...
Damn it just hit me I lost my wallet.
@JustShutUpp Aight cool at least I know they still on the air LoL
@JustShutUpp You up to date with it or still watching?
@JustShutUpp Wow, I got to see what it look like. The UK version is so raw LoL
@JustShutUpp Which ever version is on Netflix. I'm starting season 5 tonight. There's a difference?
Been Shameless binge watching over the past month, I started cursing like these niggas.
This one's a little different.
I did it.
Everywhere I go!
Steamy.
Niggas don't get tired of being Twitter bitches?
This fool's gold.
I'm so tired I can eat a pillow.
God be looking out for me in traffic.

Quantity is just a figment of our imagination.
Might invest in a fish tank.
You can't put everybody on.
This been one weird ass month.
Everybody know what bussin' cheeks sound like. So you know when you hear it outside of where it belongs.
@sexycarine18 <BANKNOTE WITH DOLLAR SIGN>.
I have a list of favorite words &amp; all of them seem to not make sense anymore.
I want to do voice overs.
I have a feeling somebody in Budweiser has pitched trademarking the term ThotJuice before.
Fried Chicken &amp; Playoffs.
@sexycarine18 You a Huxtable.
Got a song in my heart.

Happy Mother's Day.
Listen to DJ BENZY STYLES JAN 2014 MIX by Dj Benzy Styles #np on #SoundCloud 
Truck driver, don't take it personal.
If you spot me tonight, drink on me.
I'm good!
Me enjoying silence with you means I fucks with your mental.
Aye I found one. 
@_timartel Happy birthday!
I love this.




Today just one of those days. 
How you eat pizza with out crust?
Made Kim's but no Faith's. Nice &amp; slim, same face.
Visa.
How come niggas don't hang sneakers on street phone cords no more?
I hate when it look like its about to rain, all day. Then it don't.
That's what that mean.
Yo?
7/25/15.
Might record it on IG on day.
Niggas still singing that song LoL
When a Queens nigga want ya, &amp; them Brooklyn niggas can't afford ya.
This shit just keep on getting better.
I don't mind.
Where Kelis from?
I'm just waiting for that first BBQ to play Beenie Man &amp; Lady Saw. Those be the ones with that good jerk chicken.
That's what every nigga wants. Minus the child support.
Damn. 
@KadeemIsOnline I respect it. Your own temper don't even listen to you sometimes.
Only thing I'm fight in the rain over is family.
@KadeemIsOnline It had to have been that deep.
@StefLove_ I will.
Or something I'm convinced wouldn't happen.
Ain't trying to force it. In order for me to really enjoy something for what it is it either has to be the last thing on my mind.
Never had Coldstone.
I swear if a rain cloud formed right while niggas is asking "So whassup?!", niggas would forget all about scrapping.
Niggas never fight in rain.
Bitches still don't know to react, to sincerity...<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>.
Just got to keep at it.
The Knicks will be back. We America's team.
I don't know what that means.
If a chick got the same principles as a Knick fan does, we can make it.
Something ain't right.

Never adjust to attract.
I want to have a conversation through music. Like you play a track, I play a track. Each track like a response.

I'm starting to think these memes are being planned.
That was a great PR move for Denzel to go to the fight looking like that. He about to come back in 2 months looking like he 36 again.
Just general.
Not on no gangsta shit.
Before you question somebody lifestyle always ask yourself can you yourself say what you about to say to their face.
Taking a shit in a chick crib so life threatening.
The only thing is her look is sorta like her job. Which kinda seems lazy. But odd chicks can't relate seeing they take hours to get ready.
Arrogance ain't confidence. Looks don't make you deserve anything.
THAT'S why I adore Kim K.
Confidence is very attractive.
Separation creates appreciation. But you have to be able to separate it from desperation. With out hesitation. Worst case? Masterbation.
Intimacy runs dry in bulk.
As much as we come at cops, we should be truly thankful for our freedom.
I hope y'all fuck with what's coming next. <NEW MOON WITH FACE>.
Life.
@Benny_Powers Plus a good source of entertainment at times.
I could see why people don't like Stephen A. Smith but I can't find a reason why people like Jalen Roae.
Smh.
I think about it.

@ShenaeCurry Tell her I said Happy Birthday.
About to go buy some dreads.
@ShenaeCurry <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><OK HAND SIGN>üèæ<OK HAND SIGN>üèæ.

I'm rolling with 2 bad bitches because misery loves company. One sweet. One sour. My honey bee. My bumble bee.
NOOOO!
She want me to eat her sugar. I said why you in a hurry?
"No Worries" will always be in top 5 just because the time that it came out.

....
I got my ways. And you got your days. And we gave it our best shot. But I just got grazed. I'm sorry.
I suck &amp; fuck &amp; finger you. But you want me to cling to you. And I ain't asking you to change, because I know I can't jingle you.
I swear I like her more than she think I do, girl when I think of you, my dick just start to jumping like a fucking kangaroo.
And my homies say she cuter than my other bitches. And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom fitted.
One minute she love me. The next minute she hate me. That's 2 minutes of my life that she done wasted.
She say "you ain't shit, you got me all impatient", cry me a river I could hear my conscience while I surf off. <SURFER>üèæ.
But Imma be here next week so call your company &amp; take off.
Hop back in my spaceship, girl I got to drop your ass off. Because I just come to take it, then you know I got to take off.
@molleethemaid Irony. Isn't it.
She's asking do you have the time to listen to me whine. She's asking "who's on the other line? You diss me every time".
@molleethemaid Jay Z pulled one off.
She fell in love with a Martian, I said you too down to Earth.
@molleethemaid It's not your fault.
@molleethemaid Ok.
If there's food for thought, then I'm guilty of greed.
@molleethemaid She's beauty personified in a human being. "Natural" or not, she can own a room. Her confidence is what makes me want her.
@molleethemaid It's destiny.
@FxckingVALID I won't. I don't got the heart for it.
@molleethemaid I know, &amp; I been trying like Hell to avoid it. Might crush me.
I think about it now, I need 2 copies of that book. Once the pages start getting sticky I doubt it's going to leave my room.
@molleethemaid I'm deadass.
@FxckingVALID It ain't an obsession if she ain't block me yet <WHITE UP POINTING INDEX>üèæÔ∏è<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>.
Believe it or not, I still haven't seen the Ray J-Kim tape. I don't want to. At least not yet.
@FxckingVALID LoL some do, if they fucks with artist heavy. This one of them situations.
I been fucking Mary Jane, she was the bestie when she was Virgin Mary.
You still buy albums after they leak right? RT @FxckingVALID: Lol ain't nothing we haven't seen already RT @Reemaveli: I need that Kim book.
You ain't wavy, you just a nigga with a surfboard.
I need that Kim book.
Gunplay be rapping.
That song.
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up. I just wanted some time, she say "okay I'm ya honor".
Look girl, just gimmie that brain, &amp; I'll return the favor. Them hoes say I'mma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em.
I ain't trippin', but she be trippin'. They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin'.
Got so many hoes, I'm hoe'n, but she the only one worth knowin'. And yeah I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in.
But that's neither here nor there. And my dick is her chair. It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software.
Thats neither here nor there. She been contemplating short hair. She say she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches.
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs. She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi.
If words is keys I treat the puss like it's push to start. You niggas flying across the country, I just pull up &amp; park.
Go ahead. Show them. RT @BiPolaRneLLZ: Lemme show u a few thangs <PERSON FROWNING>üèø<KISS MARK><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
Nah Gudda best verse to me got to be on "Gunwalk".

@molleethemaid You over there bugging out now.
@molleethemaid It does<WHITE UP POINTING INDEX>üèæÔ∏è, &amp; Wayne said it.
She said she love me, but that's the Molly talking. She want to blow me, like a signing bonus.
LIC is the best once it's 11pm.
Tight I got to wait until there ain't no traffic to get my burrito.
I could go for some corn beef &amp; cabbage right now.
The coast is clear.
It's still part of the weekend today.
I'm start the night with 3 coronas.
Niggas ain't friends.
Nigga dead ass venting. But it's taken as a joke.
Don't put on a sundress if your breasts ain't crip.
Nah if you really want to piss some off, you have to use lines from the Star Spangled as a compelling defense in a debate/argument.
Seen a ass so nice I ended up saying denim instead of damn.
LoL at the fact that "It's complicated" is an accepted relationship status on a social network.
It's not that complicated.

Yeah!
Today should've been tomorrow.
Who ending the song though? I say Fetty, got the higher voice.

Happy birthday to my Uncle. Get home soon. <RAISED FIST>üèæ.
It don't be that deep.
Chicks make it so that no matter how much we would want to chill with them it always comes with a precaution of being group chat material.
Crazy thing about emojis is that they really explain the unexplainable.
Crispy white T.
Crispy Bacon.
Crispy hundred dollar bill.
You know it's a great thing if it goes well together with the word crispy.
Just saying the word crispy chicken sounds like it's meant to be every time.
@ShenaeCurry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>.
@ShenaeCurry Either way, you know he got game. 
@ShenaeCurry These Jordan memes are gold.
I don't care how hot it is outside, I just can't fall asleep with out some type of blanket.

You should go to jail for throwing a whole pot of fresh coffee on some one.
It's really all the horniest shit we could think of being said to each other.
The sex ain't the same once you not doing all that shit you said you do. That's why I take sexting with a grain of salt.
Talking all that shit... Soon as I hit... <HEADPHONE>.
Never underestimate the capacity or the toughness.
Snapple ain't what it use to be.
I apologize when I shouldn't.
Niggas who swear they not faggots always spotting niggas who are.
Bitches who swear they not petty always spotting other bitches who aren't.
Your mind can only show you what it knows.
I feel like emotions are spawned from uncertainty. Because they always seem to settle down with reassurance, no matter the emotion.
Chicks who take initiative &gt;
Shaggy so high he on the wrong network. 
Cigars &amp; hookah basically the same shit.
I don't get the point of a cigar.
Most chicks be wanting sex all day but can barely be on top for 3 minutes.
Like my nigga. You see how much I got. Stop being a faggot.
I really want to yell at these niggas some times &amp; tell them extra sauce don't mean one.
I get shit is different once you have a kid &amp; allat. But yo. It's just a house. Not a different life.
As much as you can appreciate some one, when do you have time to appreciate yourself?
Man my wife just has to understand my 2 house theory or I just won't have one.
Yall forget that term means not there. So if you not being missed, you still there, in some capacity.
It ain't the end of the world if some one doesn't miss you.
Now ain't the time.
Serena butt don't even look like it jiggle though. That's type wack.

But not in a literal sense. Y'all take that word too seriously.
Every guy has a heart. We just think every girl is a hoe from the start because of that shit.
On some G shit I really wished women cared more about learning one nigga instead of trying to be perfect for every nigga they expect to see.
Welp. Roll up.

@EjikeTheGREAT Nah you talking like he Sanchez. He was just painful to watch. Geno shows flashes but bitches up when shit don't go right.
You playing in NY, you got to play like you from here.
I think Geno need to have a public enemy #1 mentality if he really want to be elite. He don't have that instinct. That thirst for blood.
@EjikeTheGREAT I think he just have issues dealing with confidence on the field. They not sure about him either with all those backs we got.
@EjikeTheGREAT They not going to force him out there from what it seems. Geno is looking more like a game manager than the future now.

@__NonchalanT He has to go in thinking that, but the only thing that would have to go home is that ego because the public won't allow it.
@LETEM_KNO_LECHI I think so too but it won't be because of the fight. A decision.
The biggest fight in the sport' rematch would be on his call. The best the sport had to offer, lost. He would still be undefeated.
If Floyd wins, he owns the entire sport. No exaggeration.
As the fight gets closer, I really am starting to feel like Mayweather is going to get screwed.
I will say this. He leaving the West.

I knew I wasn't bugging.
Clothes don't make the man.
I'ma be rocking me a tall tee this summer with the Du-Rag strings hanging.
But then there lies the question of do you love me if you can't even embrace your flaws?
When you asking "how?" &amp; it change it to "hoe?", sometimes it don't be wrong though.
At least it got out of the hoe = how phase.
Root don't even make sense in the sentence. Why are you trying to fix it.
I have the stupidest iPhone on the planet.
As much as I curse, those simple insults like telling some one to root in hell or kiss your ass, those come from the heart.
Time Warner can root in Hell.
Chicks would give up the coochie before the pots &amp; pans.
And I get high with my baby.
Yeah hoe.
Somebody always knocking my cup over.
What's the difference? Is Facebook hacking your life &amp; just posting shit you don't want it to?
I always found it funny how people say they got rid of Facebook because they don't want people in their business, but got other networks.

I don't know how I feel about Jersey right now.
@Laviish_Lay Didn't see that one coming.
Fetty from the A?
@ArtistNamed_DS Ok.
@ArtistNamed_DS She does nothing in the White House.
@ArtistNamed_DS Why not president? If she could meet with foreign governments, should she be able to hold it down right?
@ArtistNamed_DS Would you vote for Michelle Obama if she ran today? Even though she has no prior political experience?
@ArtistNamed_DS Lmao, even though Kim owns more businesses &amp; net worth.
@ArtistNamed_DS Which basically means she is just a mascot. She not a button pusher. Her job is her appearances. Just like Kim.
@ArtistNamed_DS I was responding to your example on that. My stand is strictly what does she do.
Fetty Wap got some tracks.
@neilyyyy Auto text did that.
Just got word I should be receiving my tickets for OVO fest soon. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>.

Y'all refer to Al Sharpton as reverend too right?
@ArtistNamed_DS Always do. She was a lawyer &amp; writer. She married smart.
<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>üññüèæ. 
Nobody answering the question. Oh aight.
@ArtistNamed_DS Kim K IS social media. She's all over it. You act like her meeting these governments isn't because choice A was too busy.
@ArtistNamed_DS Honestly, Kim K don't do the same shit you just mentioned?
@ArtistNamed_DS What. Does. Michelle. Obama. Do.
When you a single mom but it's not your day to watch the kids 
Kim K did more for this country than Michelle Obama did if we want to get technical but niggas is calling me racist.

Woulda, coulda, shoulda &amp; associates. Get your feelings protected by the best law firm in the business today!
I seriously don't get how people respect those conversations they know they won't ever hear when that person is in there presence.
You don't miss me if I'm still missing.
Don't tell you miss me if you never made a real effort to see me.
Nah.
Your flaws, probably never truly embraced &amp; accepted by those that love you. If they where they wouldn't poke fun at them. They'd love them.
Only because it's like all people seem to remember.
Perfection &amp; flawlessness is really in the beholder.
You can't get over shit faster than she does. That's the rule.
We can't come to you to talk about how horrible of a day we had because you want to bring up shit from 2 months ago.
Like, chill. You my woman. You supposed to make all my troubles feel nonexistent. Not be the biggest one.
If you really treat niggas good, that nigga is not going to do dick head shit. Just guy shit. With his niggas.
@neilyyyy 
I use think having a Martin &amp; Gina relationship was cool until I realized Gina ain't really do shit for him.
Because I like saying it.
Fuck you.
Some people's opinion is really just used to entertain.

You want to make that your thing, more power to you. Just don't do the finger pointing &amp; whispering.
Philly in this bitch!
I don't understand why people act like they don't have their moments where they want to be to themselves. Relationship or not.
The reactions they want niggas to have only happens when they asking "why you laughing" or when they telling you not to laugh.
Chicks are funny when their intentions isn't to be funny.
@SanaLorraine Yo GTFOH! 
@SanaLorraine Remembering this.
@SanaLorraine You'll be back.
Female Knick fans ain't been found all year.
Don't be a thot out of anger. It's not a good look in these streets.
If we having a discussion &amp; you stuttering on certain answers, it's cool, I won't make it hot you fronting.
And I don't ever ask for homage to be paid, because niggas never pay they bills on time anyway.
Damn I want some rice &amp; beans.

Your web browser history tells you what you are about.
I would come out to just silence. Let niggas know I'm not playing. No more fan fare. Let's fight nigga.
I wonder who Floyd going to pick come out to at the fight.
I really haven't been following.
@RelloJames Well there that goes.
I wouldn't stop laughing if Miami won this year.
Warriors ain't winning the chip.
I ain't look at the match ups yet but I feel like the Bucks are going to make it out the second round.
I will be the biggest Lebron fan on the planet during that series if it ever happen.
I don't care who win the chip, I just want to see the Wizards get swept if they play the Cavs.
Another established vet too who can score at will is what we need in that locker room if Melo going to be our franchise player.
Those brothers are athletes. If any of them can shoot it'd be a wrap.
And we got thannis older brother too.
And one of the Harrison twins if they there around our next pick.
I hope Phil take Towns.
I really don't want to buy a Melo jersey.
As much as I fucked with Amare, after that first injury I just couldn't trust it.
I just want to be able to buy a jersey that I can wear for more than 3 years.
No more jokes.
No more pain.
Money Trees was on repeat for many days.
Monster was the best one he did.
I fucks with Kendrick though. His freestyles are crazy.

@Truesntattoos I fucked with everything he did on it but skipped the features. They wasn't hitting. My favorite joint off it is "No Haters".

All them years of customer service you develop a habit of listening to what people are actually saying to try to get a better understanding.
Some people truly talk too much.
Once cameras got added to phones, privacy went out the window.
Some times sex outside better than anywhere else. Sometimes you want to sit on the single seat right next to the back doors on the bus.

Just make sure your headphones ain't turned up too loudly where she can hear your playlist.
Most times chicks be talking &amp; expecting you to know with out explanation. Ask her "how", she going to implode for the next hour.
A woman's kryptonite is simply asking her "how".
I say make it worth my while!
I wouldn't to be conformed if it meant wearing a muzzle.
Food, shelter, &amp; clothing is not taking care of your child.
Damn.
It's nobody's fault.
I don't speak to most because I can't find the tolerance necessary.

Soon as it turned April, niggas turned in to legit fools.
Especially when it should've been handled by now by, you.
Do not rush me son. Because the minute I fuck up &amp; you try to come at my neck for it everything you say will be taken as fighting words.
Because I'm thinking about you.
When you fucking on a nigga I hope you thinking about me. When you laying on that nigga I hope you thinking about me.
Got my dick sucked &amp; I was thinking about you. I was fucking on a slut &amp; I was thinking about you.
Do feel you better about yourself?
You know what they say about that magic number.
Should've did it at least once. <SLEEPY FACE>.
Why you want to know for.
Niggas be talking in circles all for wanting to sound important.
Never cared for stuttering, just the timing of it.
Some people really don't have that voice inside that tells them they've gone too far.
That's the long laugh on you hoes.
<CONFUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE>.

Wow.

Maybe it was dry.

It's makes more sense now.
You in to a chick that know her music, you just want to sit &amp; listen to shit with her all day.

There use to be a time where the officers never showed up.

I think chicks who adlib in conversation are fucking hilarious.

Nah this shit is different.
One thing about these fight videos is you never see niggas fighting in the rain.
World premiere.
Gushers are better than water when your mouth dry.
As sick &amp; twisted as homie is, Joe Carroll was the man when it to the bitches.
Losing a wallet is like getting a write up.
I feel like catchers should get paid more than pitchers.

What's the end game. What's the walk away.
Niggas would really do some blatant fuck boy shit, &amp; expect you not to be furious.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Driving through Far Rock bumping "Trap Niggas". Shit feel like it's live.

Yeah it's over...
The only thing I get from a chick bragging about how thick she is is her not wanting to do things that would make her look or feel fat.
Thick girls aim for the bounce which is cool, skinny girls are more of the waist line specialist. Any butt cup they have is a plus.
Skinny girls shake their ass better.

For real. RT @ESSSNTL: Man. @rashadmusic this album is still amazing 
Shit got too real.

This the only song I put above Thriller.

Lemon pepper wings &amp; a freeze cup.

Mixxy just mean that the spot you at got somebody of interest there.

Troy can spit. Be a groupie now or die later hoe.
I need me a Conley P track.
Sometimes I wonder what a track with me &amp; a few rappers off here would sound like.
I respect the hell out of a few people's music opinions.
That's old shit.
I don't even like calling bitches ma, it sounds too degrading.
If you don't get wedgies, then the ass ain't fat ma.
Popeyes will have you on the toilet wearing a seatbelt.
I love titties.
If I ruled the world...
Son, what.
Rather be judged by a jury than a jury of my peers.
Leave the gossiping for the bitches man.
Sharper than a tac hoe, you could keep the tic toe.
Young Mula baby, young, young Mula baby. You ready?

@undenyinqbeauty I was tripping off how I use to sleep at your crib...
Watch me, going out of my way, when I should've went home.
I was shoulder leaning now your bopper want to bop me.
I hate seeing chicks spit in the street.
Shorty got dunked on so badly her whole weave came off. I saw that 2 weeks ago &amp; just stopped laughing at that.
Tick tock, you don't stop.
She let me hide my weed in her titties.

Can't play defense with out it. Can't score efficiently with out it.
This whole idea of one player changing your franchise around is a facade though. Chemistry trumps all.
Kevin Love probably just sitting there saying to himself "Yo these niggas is faggots...".
All these reports about Lebron wanting control over a franchise is really alarming to me though.
If Cleveland win a chip, Lebron not finishing his career there.
Tobias Harris need to be a Knick next year.
Don't sign talent that just wants to cash out. Their are players who actually want &amp; dream of playing here.
You can't find a coach in the league that could do remotely better with this roster. Popovich probably would've started 3 players only.
At this point we just need players. I don't think it's fair that Fisher going to scrutinized even harder next year.
I fucks with Derek Fisher as a coach. That whole coaching staff as matter of fact.
We ain't even going to win 20 games...
We'll be back. RT @Lifestyle_AList: Bout time RT @Reemaveli: Every Knick fan has been humbled this year.
Towns could be a force with a PG.

Some shit you see happening right before you, the more you question it, like "What?", the more shit gets realer.
Last night was jokes.
Shit be too much when you got mad Chiefs &amp; no Indians.
Ronda Rousey can break all your ligaments &amp; the minute you push her back she can call the cops on you.
Then she stick out her tongue, well since you act like a dog, I'm going to fuck you like one.
Most chicks won't let their nigga go certain places only because of how they think chicks will look at you.
I got to fuck with my first MPC &amp; I been beating on everything ever since.
The right eyes watching will turn her on.
She say she from Floral Park, so I know she don't mind.
The more you seem flawless to many, the more people try to highlight flaws they gave you.

Wooo.

I don't know how niggas eat street vendor hot dogs.
I hope this shit got beer.
Let a dog roam &amp; he'll find his way home.
Car show need to be good this year.
Always felt like one good clothesline would kill Snoop Dogg.
Whenever somebody ask you why you looking at them like that, they always have an idea as to why.
I get 2 bricks I'm legally changing my name to a letter.
92 bricks might still be lost. I need 2.
I forgot to do my taxes &amp; I got reminded by a nigga who forgot his on his way to Aspens.
On my way to the corner store, "Magic" came on &amp; that's when I realized my life need to change.
I'm about to go try find a brick.
I want to be able to smack people with money.
