@The_Extractor_ @ChrisDarroch2 @MrMalky hahaha, we have an in-joke now <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
@The_Extractor_ @ChrisDarroch2 @MrMalky I'd absolutely watch this movie. With OR without the naked dancing scene.
@RebeccahLouise #TheInternetRemembers
@RebeccahLouise And given the employment situation these days you really want to make yourself as marketable as possible. Bizness skillz
Definition of genius: Student in high unemployment area that presumably wants to get a job sending homophobic tweets using his real name.
@RebeccahLouise You'd think a business student like Stephen Doheny would be smarter than sending homophobic tweets with his real name.
@RebeccahLouise @dearbaile Meanwhile I'm laughing at guy who said that for his total failure to control his T-zone. Bro do u even concealer?
@RebeccahLouise humour is the only way I know how to respond to bullsh*t! Not your fault this guy can't follow the plot of a children's film
@RebeccahLouise 'I know! Compare her to the heroine everyone likes who ends up happy &amp; loved, that'll show her!' Guy can't even insult good.
@RebeccahLouise A real insult would be comparing you to Farquaad, a nasty entitled baby-man that insults women based on looks. Wait a sec..
@RebeccahLouise I thought the point was Fiona was beautiful the entire time and didn't need to change herself to please some pr*ck <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LA_Anders That's weather permitting fyi. I won't make you sit out in the rain with me, it's cool :)
If you're coming up I hope you like marshmallows because I'm learning how to make a sweet campfire &amp; we can share:) #TakeUsWithYouScotland
HAHAHAHA. Oh BBC, you say the craziest sh*t. 
"Leave them to starve" -Ugh :(  
@LA_Anders Big improvement still needed. article specifically mentions improvements needed for trans and intersex persons, but we'll do it!
Something to be really proud of!! Scotland rated #1 for LGBTI legal equality in Europe!! <RAINBOW>  
@RebeccahLouise @dgahk Ok I'm done now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@Scriblit @Sparkle__Monkey This is a terrific tweet. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@RebeccahLouise @dgahk And a triangle has 3 points. And 'Neo' has 3 letters. You're the matrix dude <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RebeccahLouise @dgahk And did you know you can fit a bunch of triangles together and make a rectangle. Imagine! #conspiracy
@RebeccahLouise @dgahk Naw you lying, you're crying because an amateur rollerblader doesn't imagine your triangle.<UP-POINTING RED TRIANGLE><DOWN-POINTING RED TRIANGLE><UP-POINTING RED TRIANGLE><DOWN-POINTING RED TRIANGLE><UP-POINTING RED TRIANGLE> Truth is out there!
@RebeccahLouise @dgahk One of his big achievements is getting retweeted that one time 2 years ago. Bless.

@MsJackMonroe how come?
Why can't everyone see this story? #ToriesOutNow 
Not a dog bed. Dog don't care. 
@UFOria_ @LillyLyle it's almost TOO easy <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@UFOria_ @LillyLyle And you know someone will read that last tweet and go 'I knew it'
@UFOria_ @LillyLyle Best friends are English, dad from Blackburn, lived there 8 years, huge chunk of my life all a ruse to hide my extremism
@DavidJFHalliday @hoppinghaggis I agree with this. My dad said the contradiction of being both further right + further left would undo them
@MissBabington How're you getting on now?
@UFOria_ @LillyLyle I'm always surprised to find I'm an extremist, sitting over here drinking coffee and playing SimCity in an extreme way
@ipasho @LillyLyle It's already the largest unelected government outside of China, So they'll just go ahead add to that ignominious title
"But if me and my buddies don't watch a terrified animal get torn apart while it's still alive, how will we know we're men?" - Tory Logic

#helenswriting #disability  #ToriesOutNow
You've got a right to vote AND a right to protest. The presence of one pillar does not undermine a second pillar. They both hold up the roof
When it comes to democracy, the right to protest is one of those important bits.
The most amazing tweets I'm seeing today are from people that think *the right to protest &amp; free association* is "Un-democratic"
Whoever did this should hang his or her head in SHAME. Then go clean this up and acknowledge how awful this is. 
@_davethomson @robertleslie69 Lookit that bio He's 'taking his country back' from radical liberal islamist non-christian porn watchers.
@1jamiefoster @AnitaBellows12 @tasneemmiraf @Dis_PPL_Protest The right to protest &amp; freedom of association IS democracy.
@RebeccahLouise His twitter bio says "They don't make em like this anymore"  

- That's a big win for all of us to be honest.
@Nelsims411 It's bad when you're surprised it got any coverage at all - I figured this would be another that goes completely ignored
Please RT - #DemiMcCann missing from Kilwinning  
And the Independent supported them.  
@MisssyM I think he's only going if he's pushed tbh
@RodneySofa @iainmartin1 @MackieJonathan jealous of @ChrisLawSNP having a fancier auto than him.
@KittenBitten01 good grief
@andalg1 @Earindill @bingomouse75 @SovereignAnnie @Tom_Celt Have we got bandit hats and a big burlap sack with VOTES written on it?
@macelven @patronsaintofca It's basically like we engineered this entire thing and this was our plan all along
I mean, as a Scottish voter I know the result in places like Truro, Devon, Norfolk are my fault, the only question is how
@macelven @patronsaintofca Have you had a glance at some of the discussions though, replies to Duncan etc like (+_+)
@DanLeePadgett @MrMo_J This can count as a book report
@mhairi1921 Good luck for your exams and on your dissertation. We are all rooting for you. You got this!
@Tighnacoille @SO_1888 And SO telling that instead of focusing on things like Ian Smart's tweets TODAY they focus on a 15 year old's instead
@SO_1888 @Tighnacoille When I think how insufferable I was as a kid (Far more so than now!) I thank my stars there were no smartphones
@MisssyM At this rate we'll get parity around the same time we get 3D printed human hearts.
BBC uses picture of Miliband and Murphy with Curran off to one side in blurb about @nataliemcgarry because of course 
When is the next #FMQs ? That's going to be interesting.
@EilidhL_ It'll be great. My friend's teen daughter has got to see some confident and capable women succeeding and that's like a spark
@EilidhL_  And asked about nerves about going to Westminster: “If I become an MP, the nerves should be on their part. Not mine.” She slays.
@EilidhL_  It's also the fact that despite all that she unseated one of their biggest heaviest hitters in a solid red seat
@EilidhL_ Mine too. She came to the count with her dad, she's got an exam today, she has been brave &amp; forthright throughout entire election
“We will deliver that in-out referendum on Europe,” 

Oh. Great.
@AnimeJune My dad just moved back to BC from Alberta and when he was saying NDP could take it this time I didn't believe it would happen
@AnimeJune Shocked how low that is. One thing we're proud of in Scotland is the way we've brought turnout up. Not great yet but it's better
@AnimeJune Do you know what the turnout was in Alberta by the way? I don't know if provincial elections in Canada use FPTP
@AnimeJune Thank you, we're optimistic that despite the results from England a positive alternative opposition will keep at it
@EilidhL_ #NeverForget Ukraine was robbed at Eurovision 2007 by some ballad no one remembers. 
@EilidhL_ Ukraine isn't in Eurovision this year so I don't know who to back. Perhaps Iceland.
Two Quaker MPs have been elected, first in 10 years. 
@LA_Anders Gonna delete this tweet bec I mean with respect to # of seats but it sounds like I'm pointing finger at people instead
@LoLetters Don't worry Friend, we know x This has all to do with the need for electoral reform.
@LynnieYankee @patronsaintofca No of course it's not nuts, it's empathy xx
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen Not that it makes a real difference with respect to this jumble - the result is as big a mess as ever.
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen Deleted my original % of MPs thing as I used current figures for Wales/NI/Scotland but old for England.
@luciebd @eddireader No indeed, you can basically draw a line across where it starts to change.
@AngusM1966 yup. Our 117 combined seats is just not enough to balance anything out
@GrohlMrs @je5kby I know they do, that's why it's so sad xx
@limenale 3.6 million votes overall for UKIP. Yes, the fact they've only one MP is also purely down to FPTP. They've gained everywhere.
@limenale FPTP plays a significant role. Green Party gained over one million votes, only in two areas did they lose support
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen evidence of this is def. present in the fact Greens got over one million votes and just a single MP.
SNP 1.4m votes 56 MPs
DUP 0.18m votes 8 MPs
UKIP 3.7m votes 1 MP 
Greens 1.1m votes 1MP

via @RickDeakin
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen We absolutely need electoral reform. FPTP is not fit for purpose.
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen As always, the moves and gains and losses in all areas is more complicated than in &amp; out.
@graygoods @TiresiasGreen It's just number of Conservative MPs divided by total number MPs elected per country. 
The entirety of Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland have 117 MPs and England has 533. They're 82% with respect to # of MPs. That's how.
I am proud that my vote actually meant something this time. It is bittersweet but I am proud nonetheless. I voted with my mind &amp; heart.
@EilidhL_ I've got two. But thankfully they're both political science majors that follow every single party so I'll give it a pass :)
@NursieDear25 Good job nursie, message received :)

@NursieDear25 @Sheltie2014 @JournoStephen to their phones, clothes, hair, nails, nothing they can't be demonised for and it's all such shit
@saladinahmed I think you just secured my ticket to this film for sure
@NursieDear25 @Sheltie2014 @JournoStephen No indeed, people already dump on them for literally everything they do in life
@NursieDear25 @Sheltie2014 @JournoStephen deprivation plays a big role in feeling disconnected from politics
@NursieDear25 @Sheltie2014 @JournoStephen I'm fascinated with diff turnout by areas. Look at diff between Switzerland and Austria
@NursieDear25 @Sheltie2014 @JournoStephen I've been seeing mention of higher turnout than that (70+) not that that's something to sing about
@AgentAvalon The count at the referendum hurt, but this time I feel hope again. Also: wicked banter on here just now
Ahh I'm getting tired but I want to know results as soon as they come in!
@MrRaffaelli thanks. He's always so charming.
@MrRaffaelli details!

Ugh. So stressed out and knackered with Uni and stuff and being excited/anxious about election today isn't helping. Blurghh
@MarcasPadraig @RebeccahLouise I would also omit The Fly because I prefer Goldblum with his jaw, not a fly.

Good day to share this again. Words from Tommy Douglas, a Scotsman from Falkirk, beloved as 'The Best Canadian' 
@JJ_Bola What's truly sad is this is even a question that needs answering rather than just being the way it is
@LillyLyle @CTVNews It's 2:30am in BC but when my dad wakes up he's going to go nuts <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@RobertJSomynne As a metaphor for entitlement the 4x4 is an apt choice in any dream lane.
@JJ_Bola I do, I'm in Scotland and I'm voting SNP
@RobertJSomynne Tommy Douglas was a good'un. My dad quoted him to me on 19th Sept 'Courage friends tis not too late to build a better world'
@RobertJSomynne So how's THAT for some optimism to wipe away the cobwebs of apathy! The arc bends towards justice
@RobertJSomynne The NDP was founded by a Scot named Tommy Douglas who was voted The Greatest Canadian for championing social medicine
@RobertJSomynne Alberta, with 44-yrs of Conservative premiership, just elected with a majority a woman leader of their equivalent of SNP
@LillyLyle @CTVNews I'm really really chuffed about this!

@The_Extractor_ @DIANAATURNBULL  it's kind of like watching an uncomfortable bread stick try not to humiliate itself in front of a crowd.
@The_Extractor_ @DIANAATURNBULL   I have a very specific dance style 'The self-conscious shuffle with the T-Rex arms'
@danni_paterson it's like the Stannis Baratheon of sportsballs. Mostly kind of ignored but also the one true king &amp; Winter is coming.
@The_Extractor_ @DIANAATURNBULL  worm dance and dance worm give very different search results. I'll just assume that's you in that pic
@danni_paterson this is precisely correct, it is the sportsball with the most fighting and the best hotdogs.
@The_Extractor_ @DIANAATURNBULL  you do realise I got sidetracked watching YouTube videos of people doing 'the worm' because of that <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@danni_paterson For the purposes of your new career just consider hockey pucks a type of sportsball and I'll read it. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@The_Extractor_ @DIANAATURNBULL  So it's more of a shimmy then, I say shimmy on wayward son

@EilidhL_ But let's not distract here, because this is not your problem, bros.
@EilidhL_ It was common for some workers at my old job - And the saddest part was other women would hear thisand go "That's a great idea"

@alextomo what's with these guys and their genetics/DNA/lineage talk
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty @SarahBS_27 And I just realized how apathetic everything I wrote sounds! Bugger! :D
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty actively barring progress while also denying you the proverbial nail pull you need to feel empowered for change
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty So I totally understand my friends resignation &amp; apathy. It's hard to keep going forever when the entire gov is
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty It feels to me like if BritEstablishment was a person that person would spend his days nailing doors shut.
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty Frankly the entirety of the establishment in Westminster is diametrically opposed to change
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty And that can lead to ignorance about real situation. I've had more than 1 person not believe me when talking cuts
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty And I feel bad about it. I hate seeing that they feel resigned to bad politics and hopeless re: countering it
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty More I feel a sort of awkward lack of involvement or the usual "Nothing would change anyway/What good is it"
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty That could just be my friends, I can't extrapolate, but they're not involved excited, engaged, active, interested
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty I have noticed in discussion with friends in England a different attitude with respect to speaking about politics
@my_daily_gripe <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ Thanks for the pickmeup
@RobertJSomynne @Roy1Batty You're a hardier sort than I am Robert, I've felt apathy a few times and always need to restore myself after
@my_daily_gripe So I heard, apparently entire city was consumed by a zombie hoard within a matter of minutes. And here I am, no bear spray
@my_daily_gripe my family are all engineers and preppers, but I have to admit: bear spray is all at my dads house. You're right, NOT READY!
@Roy1Batty There's never too many dick jokes.
@my_daily_gripe I also have a sweater on. That means I am fairly well prepared for any possible outcome/taking out the bins
@Roy1Batty I tried to think up a couple jokes just now but they all came out really dirty so I'm not saying them now ;)
@my_daily_gripe Hehe, thanks mom :) I have this open off to the side while I eat, I swear!

@posnewsday Murphy stumbled over his words during a debate and people giggling over it. Internet moves fast on these things :)
@Cinders89 @patronsaintofca #Fundilymundily embiggens the smallest man.
@Cinders89 @patronsaintofca #Fundilymundily is a perfectly cromulent word!

(That's one for Simpsons fans <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>)
@Cinders89 @patronsaintofca I will find out what that means and then let you know. If it means 'to go bananas' then yes totally.
@Cinders89 @patronsaintofca my dog was losing his sh*t at the sight
@Cinders89 @patronsaintofca they weren't on leads or anything, they were just out for a family stroll totally chilled! <CAT FACE><CAT FACE><CAT FACE><CAT FACE><DOG FACE><DOG FACE><DOG FACE>
@patronsaintofca get this. Just back from walk, what'd we see? Two people walking with three dogs and a cat with 3 kittens! All in a herd
@thetwerkinggirl Such BS. It isn't surprising but it still totally sucks.
@thetwerkinggirl How have you been doing since earlier in the week? Any progress from police? Hope so <SUNFLOWER>
@kirstyyounger @LetToysBeToys @liberty__brown Looks like this colouring sheet really means to say SCIENCE rules. Nothing boy specific at all
@madihahansari Venture well :)
@Tom_Celt How you doing now? Hot coffee and a roll sort you out yet?
@madihahansari Hmmm. If there's a cafe does it do a nice soup or stew?
@madihahansari In my thread the tweet right above this one is of someones sweet potato and cranberry stir fry lunch and it looks amazing :D
@RiaDRobertson He wants to go to Highlands and maybe Skye :) It would be nice to say we went up one but I don't think any have escalators
Munro folks! Is there such a thing as a munro that is not much of a hike? Asking for an elderly relative that can't do too strenuous a walk
@PhilipThomas_45 But tbh I haven't actually seen the film since the 90s, I remember just finding it long and dull.
@PhilipThomas_45 I'd totally watch Braveheart: Men Without Tights. I had Superman IV Quest for Peace on VHS, so my judgement is nothing
@AlexPatersonSNP @AddictedToTweed @I_Whyte @jess_wlson @JanisWilson11 If this is really the way we want to go, I've got the goods.
@AddictedToTweed @JanisWilson11 @I_Whyte @jess_wlson Janis don't listen to the haters, I love your 'I'm not here for this' face :)
@alan13141314 @tristanpw1 @DearMeYes Hypothetically, I wonder if changing my name to 'Handsome Q Einstein' would be allowed
@damilne1 @traquir @Anthea_Dickson @NicolaSturgeon @WomenForIndy Yeah... I had a glance and now I'm ready for something happy instead
@PhilipThomas_45 It's like when they were talking about Gladiator 2 and then made Robin Hood instead.
@PhilipThomas_45 Braveheart 2? Is it "Braveheart and the search for pirates cove" or what
@DearMeYes @mforshizz @myviewontopic He has a PhD in insulting voters awarded by The University of Zoom.
@mforshizz @myviewontopic @DearMeYes He either gets so little attention thinks no one noticed or he's trying to GET attention by being awful
@ColinMcGarvie It's just a really dumb and insulting statement across the board.
@DearMeYes The independent candidate. Not going to give him the attention by sharing his name directly. 
@AddictedToTweed What a jerk.
So an MP candidate in East Lothian basically said that people without kids shouldn't be in charge in government.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS OR WHAT 
@EilidhL_ @Magnus_Jamieson yeah that'd do it all right, you can count on the usual suspects for sure
@EilidhL_ @Magnus_Jamieson I was wondering the same, nothing wrong with some pre-cautionary taming. Happy to get your back if needed <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@EilidhL_ @Om3zii @Salon No no no noooo why did I even scroll up to get the context on this auugh
And even if you can survive on the cash from benefits, you have to tolerate being repeatedly degraded to get them, because of course
And talking about disability bens. like it's 'sweet disability cash! Living the dream!' Benefits in the UK are SH*T, you *barely* survive it
@demipip @Nelsims411 bet he feels like a real big man now, takes real courage to insult disabled people on the Internet.  .@WowWows
And yes, if a disabled person is sharing their experience of disability and you sh*t on it, you're 100% proof jackass.
Definition of jackass: person who responds to disabled person by insulting disabled people and calling them 'pretend'

@RebeccahLouise Oh wow I admit I've no idea who he is and am making guesses based on rudeness in that pic. I didn't realise there was LOGIC

@greendadtwit @SteampunkCoffee Also try the Tunki from Peru, very nice as well :)
@greendadtwit @SteampunkCoffee This is great taste in coffee. They used to have some from Lake Kivu and it was the best ever <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@LiamLikesThis Prob worth adding it was discussion, not an argument, not insults (Despite being siblings) That's how absurd it was! :)
@LiamLikesThis True: At the end of a long discussion one of my brothers ended up un-friending the entire family on Facebook in a huff
@LiamLikesThis The thing I have always found the hardest to grasp is just how taboo conversation about this really seems
@Magnus_Jamieson I have a beloved friend who is absolutely a great excellent person but god she will be absolutely insufferable this week.
@LiamLikesThis These are gross people.
@WellNowUniverse @SiobhanFenton Think it's a sort of 'That's THEIR problem not OUR problem' sort of thing?
@LillyLyle I had to get my frustration out on it, but I think I'm good now.



@megperryman @LetToysBeToys @FisherPrice I think I had that! The elevator made a ding when it got to the top I think.
But I digress, everyone needs to be excited about this new distraction I mean ruler I mean baby.
@lindacullen1 @RebeccahLouise Happy Birthday :D
This baby timing thing is a work of evil genius tho. Announced it in time to help tory campaign in september, this week exactly the same
@NursieDear25 Sorry, my batteries died :) Hope you got some rest!
I bet I get some mad tweets over those last two royal tweets of mine. In case my opinion on this charade is not clear 
Baby 'Vote Tory' to arrive in time to lob scimitar at Cameron for the Monday edition. 
It's a big day for us all.  
#RoyalBaby is trending. 


@NursieDear25 obviously I misspelled revisionist earlier, too late to revise now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@NursieDear25 it reads like a page turner. Where it really succeeded is in actually giving a damn about the women in Mao's life
@NursieDear25 yup. Although her other book (On Mao) had real issues with being possibly speculative or revionist history in places
@NursieDear25 I'm making a concerted effort to read more women authors, especially WOC. Non-western getting priority too
@NursieDear25 A good one is 'New Emperors' by Harrison Salisbury :)

@AdamRamsay @Tom_Celt @YesScotland Where was this?
@dampscot @tylochan @brindy @jearle 
@dampscot @tylochan @brindy @jearle My eyes are always bigger than my stomach, I'll eat too much and go on a ride and feel ill :)
@kendrawcandraw One time in empty carriage I burst into "The Hills are alive with the sound of music" before spotting 1 dude sitting there
@dampscot @brindy @tylochan @jearle This chat was a pleasure btw! All the food is served at Calgary Stampede and I'd been feeling homesick:)
@dampscot @brindy @tylochan That's true, but I have poor taste. There is one good maker in US tho, See's Candies (Great brittle).
@dampscot @brindy @tylochan You can get one with scorpions, don't think it's fried tho, it's already nightmare food:( 
@dampscot @brindy @tylochan @jearle The sparkling rosé with table cloth, haha, love it :)
@dampscot @brindy @tylochan See you could easily put all of that on a stick and it would be fantastic.
@AddictedToTweed Lookit that little baby with the "I am not here for that drama" face :D
@brindy @dampscot @tylochan If you say your takeout also does corn dogs coated in french fries I'll move to your town 
@brindy @dampscot @tylochan Now you're just talking silly, everyone knows peanut butter cups are the best ;)
@dampscot @tylochan I see your deep fried zebra cheese and raise you a deep fried bacon cheese burger with 2 donuts (AKA the widow maker) :D
@LiamLikesThis @josswhedon @SarahMGellar T'is ok, but it's no The Body. And I was always meh on Riley tbh.
@LiamLikesThis @josswhedon @SarahMGellar I'd swap out Pangs and add Villains, One To Go and add in Bad Girls (because that ending)
@NursieDear25 good :) You get so many random people being really hurtful, I thought sometimes a genuinely bonkers one is quite refreshing!
@NursieDear25 Oh yeah, rich tapestry all right. Bet laughing at that brightened your day up a bit tho didn't it ;)
@NursieDear25 Barely a joke tbh:) First: he'll ask what kind of wood, 2nd: water depth. Then say he's on holiday. 3d: ask about insulation
@NursieDear25 Lol, he'll probably start planning to build his own Crannog. I can almost hear precisely what he'll say.
Phew. Don't think I've ever twitter rambled on so much. Two coffees and now I'm knackered!
@NursieDear25 Yeah taking him for surprise trip up to Highlands :)
@NursieDear25 He's visiting in a few weeks, it'll be really great despite the rants :)
@CutbackMark That's right, it's not just for show, that is TWO whole donuts with a bacon cheeseburger inside it. Be in awe :D
@NursieDear25 Who wants to build a shelter!? There's also a lot of "So dad how will you get your survival kayak in your survival shelter"
That's right. While you've treaded water with mars bars, we've perfected the art of deep-fried cheese bacon peanut butter sushi on a stick
Canada is like: In your face Scotland. Canada is number one champion now. You will never compare. 
@NursieDear25 oh yeah, every conversation invariably turns to 'wouldn't I Am Legend be fun kids?' <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@NursieDear25 my grandpa thought WW3 would be fought over the earths lakes by year 2000. I wouldn't say he was politically astute
@NursieDear25 that sucks <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@LA_Anders And he'd probably have shared his idea to like drain Loch Ness and hide it all in a secret bunker or something. He's a character.
@RebeccahLouise What kind of level is voter registration at now?
No matter how far apart we are we should still be able to treat each other with dignity. We're still going to be neighbours a week later
The politics of hate and bitterness have brought things to a standstill in the US, they've never worked to build SO LITTLE consensus *ever*
Speaking of US politics, I was also impressed the way Nicola and the tory guy who'd come today to yell &amp; try to be disruptive shook hands
@EilidhL_ Nice one, one of the downsides to living so far away from family is being unable to rope them into servitude when moving :D
Re-nationalising the postal service is not left-wing. It's just common sense. Even the US has it.
@EilidhL_ I was just popping over to your thread to see how it's going today! Glad it's all been quick
Who wants to come with me for an amazing walk along Leith Walk at the end of the month in support of @FreshStartWeb ?
@kernelsaunters @JanisWilson11 He did indeed say those words but in my opinion it was unpleasant but not a threat
@LA_Anders he was barely a metre tall and boy did he know how to get attention <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
By far the most adorable thing today was the super cute lil boy in a little blazer and big glasses yellin NIIIKAHLAHHHH!!!!
@kernelsaunters @JanisWilson11 I walked away tbh, after his comment about maybe we should've gone and died after the indyref I backed off
So engaging in street politics is actually pretty bloody hip. I don't know why it fell out of fashion, the street is a political space
And a lot of the most heart-touching pieces of street art are deeply political, almost by default
Street art is the best comparison really - it's approachable and random and follows few rules on composition 
@jruddy99 @yorkierosie @alextomo I wouldn't say the media is full of adoration, last week she was the biggest danger since abdication
@jruddy99 @yorkierosie @alextomo Cool, I understand, thanks <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> (PS lemon drizzle! it's awesome having a friend that bakes treats! <BIRTHDAY CAKE>)
@Smicht I stopped tweeting about it because there's no reason to let one negative person affect a positive mood
Scripted, dull meet and greets are always just that, they're bland and uninteresting and they almost always lack diversity
Street politics, like street art, is where you get some real expressions of thoughtfulness and real depth
@MsJackMonroe @LBLUK That sounds rubbish! Feel better soon <SUNFLOWER>
Last time I was in the back of a big group pic eating a powdered chocolate brownie. It...didn't photograph well.
I've been looking and so far haven't found any photos of me looking horrible in the background anywhere (thankfully!!)
@jruddy99 @yorkierosie @alextomo This is a friend of mine. She was happy. You're making it sound like there's something sinister in that.
I recognise a certain friend of mine who didn't want her face in pictures <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@alextomo My friend baked these last night! I can't tell you how pleased she is that she actually got to give her one <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
And my buddy Janis got in there and got a selfie!!!! (Again) <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>  
But there were so many people out to see her that would've taken up so much time. The energy was just cracklin
The fact is you'll always get haters, because Haters Gonna Hate, but what matters is we all had a positive time out with Friends <SUNFLOWER>
I was also very chuffed that a friend who'd been ill for months could make it, coming out was exciting &amp; positive for her :)
Baby was completely asleep and Nicola said she was 'blissfully unaware' but it'll definitely be a nice picture to hang on to <RAINBOW>
So the really amazing thing for me today was seeing some friends and their baby get a photo with the First Minister!
But that's not what today is about! That was just one person being rude when we had HOW MANY happy positive people out today!!
@CraigMcWilliam I've gone into Costa to get a drink, I don't want to let him upset me tbh
@LiamLikesThis He's not someone I know personally.
@LiamLikesThis Chic Moohan - ex labour councillor. Used to come shout at people during yes apparently. Being really rude about it
@LA_Anders she replied 'you're an angry man aren't you'.  He says 'Damn right I am!' Geez Louise this is dreadful.
Now he's shouting at my friend in front of her daughter...
@LA_Anders And before you ask, he's a former Labour councillor that's why I know who he is.
Labour guy on stall arguing about IndyRef. Friend say 'Do you think we would die in a corner on 19 Sept?' Labour guy says 'Maybe you should'
It's NICOLA STURGAAAAAAHN!!! @NicolaSturgeon <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@Teknogrot And Botox. My dads nose  is over here for sure <NOSE>
Umm... 
@Teknogrot I just got 36 again. Feel bad. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
How-old guessed I was anywhere from 20-56. Thinks Nicola is 12. I'm not sure if I'm offended or what. 
The internet is just SO FAST  
This How-Old site struggles with a Michelle Obama collage. 
@NursieDear25 @craigilynn likewise friend <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@craigilynn @NursieDear25 Those aren't the sorts of things you should be lucky to have, that should just be 'how people are treated' <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@craigilynn @NursieDear25 Great facilities &amp; access for disabled, good integration, lives independently in nice area, treated with dignity
@craigilynn @NursieDear25 I've counted my family lucky all these years that my bro (disabled) lives in Vancouver.
@RebeccahLouise of all the ways I can think of to spend time this is not the one to go for
@AngrySalmond @Fanilow19 Lol. That's us telt.
@macelven @patronsaintofca @Daviemc10 Sorry, I'm just running with a silly joke because of how panicky that 24 thing was :)
@RebeccahLouise What. Wait what.
@Daviemc10 @patronsaintofca Here's the pic that will accompany the '96 hours to save the Union' panic leaflet Sunday<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@NursieDear25 Yeah they used words like 'incomer' apparently. One of the 2 victims was 5 days in hospital.
@NursieDear25 Someone I know was recently subject to a race-hate attack just a few miles from here. That's where these kinds of things lead
@Smicht (This is me procrastinating from proper school) Hurrah for alternate school! :D
@Smicht Legit cool drawing of one in the wiki page though. 
@Smicht Rhymezone recommends 'Tabor: a small drum with one head of soft calfskin'
In 50 years a gay couple could say "We've been married for 50 years!" instead of "We've been waiting for this for 50 years"
Pictures of elderly people marrying their loved ones are powerful because they've had to wait DECADES.  Don't make others do the same
Opponents of same-sex marriage: Admit that an elderly couple having legal protection does no harm, you know the same is true for the young.
Here's some of the types of arguments bigots will come up with. Be in awe of the absurdity! Awe! 
If it were up to a small minority of bigots, some people would live their entire lives without being able to marry the one they love,
@wendybea I think I actually cried when I saw their picture the first time.
@wendybea I hope everyone got totally hammered at their reception and danced like mad :D
purely because you are both the same-sex. Imagine that.  It doesn't need to be that way. 
Imagine being with the person you love for 70 years, imagine loving them every day, and then being excluded from end-of-life decisions
When people are able to marry and have legal protection that can have a major impact on end of life care.
@wendybea It's radical, and very romantic <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@EilidhL_ Well that's somethin' good then :) Hope afternoon improves x
@wendybea I know right? they've been together since a few months after Pearl Harbour. That's how long they had to wait to be legal.
@LA_Anders If you don't like same-sex marriage you don't marry someone of the same-sex. Stop using your prejudice like it's a weapon.
Same-sex marriage opponents: This doesn't hurt you a damn bit. And you better learn these people aren't going away. 
Against same-sex marriage? Meet John and Richard, 91and 83. 60+ years together. Put a ring on it. Wrecked your world? 
@LA_Anders Take all the time you need. Their wedding must have been very traumatic for you so i understand if it takes you time to respond.
@LA_Anders To put that another way. These two have been each others family almost since *Pearl Harbour*. That's how long this took.
@LA_Anders Please explain why you'd rather this was never allowed. Please explain why their having to wait *72 years* was OK with you.
Against same-sex marriage? Meet Vivian and Alice, age 90 and 91. Together 72 years. Please explain how this hurt you. 
@LA_Anders I bet you can't look at these pictures and avoid cracking a smile at how happy they are. I'm betting on it 
@LA_Anders They've been married 4 years now. Please detail the damage they've done during that period. I'll wait.
Opponent of same-sex marriage? Meet Phyllis &amp; Connie. Age 76 and 84. Please explain how their marriage hurt your life 
@EilidhL_ Like gentlemen though, with imperial measurements, not metric.
@EilidhL_ It's tiring always having to strut because teh ladiez. When there's no women around there's no posturing like that *at all*
@EilidhL_ If only there were no women around then prime Peacocks like Gove &amp; Paxman wouldn't always have to strut their stuff SO. HARD.
@CraigMcWilliam And shoulders covered. You can't be eaten by monsters if your shoulders are covered. That's just the rules.
@CraigMcWilliam I'm turning on all the lights and checking every closet and he's gone back to sleep. No help at all :)
@CraigMcWilliam My dog does that thing where he'll start growling at the closet for no reason at night - Makes ya check every room :D
@EilidhL_ All cooties on this earth have come from women thinking thoughts. It's science.
@CraigMcWilliam @MarthaWoek I don't know what is less realistic, a Great White Shark in the hallway or an alien in the basement :D
@EilidhL_ Even beyond that, the entire thing, attitude.. the entire thing drips with so much entitlement you could drown in it
@EilidhL_ @Ian_Dunn Just finished reading. Seconded.
@EilidhL_ This club sounds horrible.

@thirda That's always been my problem with languages, I sound it out as it is spelled (Which is why my french is so bad :) )
Me too! 
@thirda Thanks :) I'm thinking about how to sound it out. 

 Is it like 'fee-ahs-garr mah-th, see-ah-mar a tha si-buh'
@Smicht Still put ya off sausage rolls tho :D
@Smicht Duuuuude
@GuyP @limenale @ChrisWaywell1 @ArlaProtein This is for a protein bar?! I never would have guessed that.

@LA_Anders Now that you are free of worrying about other peoples marriages, you will have time to enjoy a nice hobby! Perhaps cooking!
If same-sex marriage troubles you I have a very simple solution. 
DON'T MARRY SOMEONE OF THE SAME SEX AS YOU! 
Your troubles are now over!
@RebeccahLouise @aishatyler On point. A lot of pictures of couples marrying in the US were people over 60 who had waited for decades
@RebeccahLouise Not sure if you've seen this, concise arguments from RBG  
@patronsaintofca I am still trying to come up with good jokes about this. Just googled "Does Kiefer die at the end of 24 show?" :D
@Daviemc10 @macbloscaidh @patronsaintofca @YsabelleStewart 48 hours as well! That'll require TWO Kiefer Sutherlands! 
@sdailey87 @Tighnacoille I predict the rest of the sentence might have been "...as long as you live forever in Chipping Norton"
@patronsaintofca I made this joke yesterday! Out of the frame Kiefer Sutherland is standing around like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@Esti858 It's banned in UK already I think, absolutely absurd
@EilidhL_ @daviebrown Ahh yes, that sea lion comic is a classic for the ages <SPOUTING WHALE>
@NursieDear25 I'm not surprised by that, it really burns. You have my support anytime <SUNFLOWER>
@NursieDear25 I know, I couldn't think of how better to articulate it than you were already doing
@NursieDear25 Next time I'm in East Ayrshire I'm inviting you for tea and the biggest goddamn cake I can find. Good on you for today.
@rik_big The 1960s are looking at this going 'A time traveler from the past has gone rogue in the future!'
@EilidhL_ @NursieDear25 I'm just hoping it's a really really well disguised bit of satire <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@EilidhL_ @NursieDear25 Friends your efforts are noble but I cannot see this person, if genuine, ever changing this opinion <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@EilidhL_ @NursieDear25 What I'm most shocked by is the inability to see how bigotry-enshrined-in-law inevitably leads to loss of life.
This is 2015. 
@NursieDear25 You deserve a treat, dude serious. I just got here and I'm already offended you've had to have this argument.
@NursieDear25 you got some real patience on you, you rock solid <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@UK_Culture @NursieDear25 @EilidhL_ these are literally the arguments that segregationists stopped having to use *50* years ago
@UK_Culture @NursieDear25 @EilidhL_ For god sake actually think about what you are saying here and try to reflect on your own human decency
@NursieDear25 @EilidhL_ This is quite literally a Jim Crow argument. Wow. @UK_Culture @DCshego

@RobDunsmore @shocker38 
@Bopper3p @patronsaintofca @NicolaSturgeon I think it's because K isn't a very nice person and lets her dislike govern how she does her job.
@Om3zii I'm legit impressed it hasn't happened yet
@Om3zii Wonder how long before you get someone in your mentions attacking you saying you're causing *dissent* for sharing your opinion here
@EilidhL_ men are stuffed into these tight little boxes of what's politically acceptable, 2 acceptable hairstyles and 4 colours
@EilidhL_ UKIP in pinstripe shocker. Showed up in *last seasons* colours looking frumpy and dowdy. And is that a food-baby bump?!
@EilidhL_ No indeed. Frankly I'd love to see these low-balls chucked at men counterparts. But WHO are you wearing? Can we see your mani?!
@EilidhL_ But still yes, to find a comparable article on Obama you have to go back to....2012. For Michele or their kids it's, oh, *today*.
@EilidhL_ I've been viewing it as akin to Madeline Albright's pin collection. Wearing red at the conference made me think on it
@EilidhL_ I'm gonna be 'that one' today, didn't actually mind this. I've been thinking about the symbolism behind how she presents herself
@george_wallis @alanferrier @burdynumnum The sense must be stopped!
@madihahansari Ah I gotcha! I've booked &amp; stayed using airbnb. If you've got any questions I can try to help :)
@FeministaJones They detailed every single bit and zero had anything to do with Mya's death at all
@madihahansari How do you mean 'on this thing'? The app or?
@RFCSwitcheroo I don't get it?
@Auragasmic @WellNowUniverse Ah wait, revellers/mischief/ excited/ unruly. That should do it.
@Auragasmic @WellNowUniverse rowdy/high-spirited/youthful/just kids/boys will be boys/ letting off steam - Did I miss any?
The issue isn't if *others* know. It's *you* knowing. Because screwing over your country should make you feel bad. 
@ScotsFox71 @patronsaintofca @thoughtland I'm entranced by '20 ways to look younger' banner up top. I wonder if 'be extremely rich' is #1-20
@thoughtland @patronsaintofca I feel like Kiefer Sutherland is just off camera with that 24:00 countdown clock going  beep bop beep bop...
@RebeccahLouise @TheSnappyBoss @IzzyKamikaze hang tough, it's getting there x <SUNFLOWER>
@IzzyKamikaze @Phucaigh I'm still seeing these even tho I'm blocked. Surely that's an argument against *heterosexual* marriage. Mon dieu
@RebeccahLouise @TheSnappyBoss @IzzyKamikaze As a scientist, I am as offended by the abuse of logic I witnessed. 
@RebeccahLouise @Phucaigh @IzzyKamikaze I enjoy seeing someone who mentions biotech in profile argue for marriage as tho it's Newtons Law
@RebeccahLouise @Phucaigh @TheSnappyBoss @IzzyKamikaze lol, blocked me. I guess doesn't like being called not-a-lightbulb <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RebeccahLouise @Phucaigh @IzzyKamikaze Yup. be honest with yourself about where your view comes from &amp; what it actually means for people
@Phucaigh @RebeccahLouise @IzzyKamikaze Friend  I wouldn't call you a lightbulb, a lightbulb is not a static thing, it is capable of change.
@RebeccahLouise Like... Equal marriage isn't something you *believe or don't believe in* - it's something you're ashamed to have to debate
@Phucaigh @RebeccahLouise @IzzyKamikaze I'm curious why you think it's countries with equal marriage that have problems, somehow, somewhere
@Phucaigh @RebeccahLouise @IzzyKamikaze You mean like Canada? The most diverse developed country on earth? With equal marriage 10 years now?
@RebeccahLouise Wow. These are discussions you even need to have with people? Heck.
@NursieDear25 @patronsaintofca @calumfindlay22 Willie no mates.

Who …
@nickeardley @BornLippy2110 @NicolaSturgeon Has anyone ever asked David Cameron if he's REALLY in charge or is it secretly Michael Howard?
ACCURATE 
@ZaneStumpo @The_Extractor_ Sorry to hear that, not a healthy state of affairs (putting it mildly)
@ZaneStumpo @The_Extractor_ good point, I wonder how that balances out with us losing young people having to go to London in search of jobs.
@shocker38 I am on TEAM PIZZA. And nothing goes better with pizza than HUGS. Except soda. Or dipping sticks.
@AdelePatrickGWL @gwlkettle No probs, I'll try not to subsume  your list with my recommends <GRINNING FACE>
@shocker38 they're anti-hugs?? Who are these anti-hug people!
@UKIPgoogling @alexbaskhanov Ha! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> this is as good as @RikerGoogling
@The_Extractor_ Not untrue tho, lot of idea/values are v. generational. Young people will spend all their time in this century, not the last
@The_Extractor_ harsh bro <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Lol the funniest thing about Flames beating Canucks is all the basketball bros going THIS ISN'T A SPORT.
@The_Extractor_ next time be v.different and they know it. My dad (English, in Canada) and he's been calling it a slam dunk for months now
@The_Extractor_ They threw every single thing at us, from teacakes up the way, and yet we still missed it by fewer than 200,000.
@The_Extractor_ That's actually the most exciting bit tbh. The entirety of the British establishment got chucked at us and we STILL had 45%
@The_Extractor_ Gotcha, I was sure I'd seen it but I'm pretty knackered :D Thanks for explanation! (No Tunnocks for me since last year).
@The_Extractor_ teacakes. Is it sarcasm or sucking up with sugar or what - (I've been at my desk a long time. Brain function falling)
@The_Extractor_ I legit don't even understand what this is about :D
Mo!! Oh hell yeah. #onemomile    
@MrMo_J ummm..... Hmm. What.
@EilidhL_ Some of it can really get in the way of the enjoyment of the medium (As some of it should), like I just can't enjoy you anymore
@EilidhL_ We've very few left. Come across new music &amp; comedians and been smitten only to find #yourfaveisproblematic almost right away
@EilidhL_ @Mrsjackdaniels @NicolaSturgeon Good find on this article!
@EilidhL_ @Mrsjackdaniels @NicolaSturgeon Ahh no, disappointing. Let's go with Doctor Jennifer Rohn then. Cell Biology is a good fit here.
@Mrsjackdaniels @EilidhL_ @NicolaSturgeon David Attenborough is watching the entire thing from some nearby rocks.
UKIP 11% means: "The response given by 11% of the people that didn't hang up immediately upon being asked to participate in a survey"
@The_Extractor_ Woo! 
@The_Extractor_ I don't actually know what was or wasn't asked, but I am putting my money on "lol. no." to win.
lol. no.  
I went 30 seconds without seeing a panicky article about SNP bringing a plague on both our houses, it was my #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication



White men fresh out of prison = Same callback percentage as black men w/ NO R…
@shocker38 @Sparkle__Monkey @_Mozza_ I'm doing the colour run on the 9th so I can't get too...umm... unstable the day before :D
@EilidhL_ The constitutional peasants are all I ever need. I've won multiple arguments with that.
Also follow @CaroleLeger @WellNowUniverse and @RebeccahLouise because they're sharing the good stuff on here.
People to follow today: @UnaMullally because she's real tough, the kind of tough we should all hope to be.
@sineadgleeson @UnaMullally This is amazing. F**k cancer. Get through this xx
Amazing. #StephenHawking getting millions of young women into physics :) 
@HatefMokhtar Awesome science here. Now it needs to be as cheap as possible (or 100% free) and available to everyone to easily access
@AKMacG @ChristinaSNP @faisalislam Aww. No one wants that :(
@AdelePatrickGWL @gwlkettle I'm not sure it really changed my mind as much as it opened it.
@AdelePatrickGWL @gwlkettle bell hooks Ain't I A Woman.
@betaburns is this some "I'm sorry you weren't tolerant of my intolerance" crap.
@AKMacG @ChristinaSNP @faisalislam Tactile voting? That sounds like it could be kinda hot. Bet it's disappointing tho.
MSF sending 8 teams to Nepal. Nepal is a poor country and situation on the ground is bad. MSF get shit done, donate: 
@FalconerBrian @Harryslaststand @JimForScotland @Daily_Record Oh likewise, I just like him and his razor sharp tweets very much:)
@FalconerBrian @JimForScotland @Daily_Record Super hard to disagree with him because I like Harry so much, and he doesn't mince his words
@jedi_mummy gross. And bro, do you even history.
@patronsaintofca @RobertTyreBute I've wondered if JL has felt regret since then for things she said
@BlkHistStudies 
@RobertTyreBute @patronsaintofca I was still surprised by just HOW quickly she was thrown under the bus.
@pmcchambers @nbrez @TtohBee Was just going to add this!
@RebeccahLouise Oh, haha don't sweat it:) Thanks!
@RebeccahLouise Gross. I haven't seen that show in years and I think I'm glad about that
Real talk - If you're against fair and equal treatment for LGBTQ people at least acknowledge what it actually MEANS 
@The_Extractor_ No! He didn't even start screaming gibberish and trying to tear strips off his clothes! Need to make new friends for sure.
@wendybea @MrMalky @DigiKintyre @feministfox Does basketball have a guy who stands around yelling at players? Cos that's a good career tbh
@The_Extractor_ Someone I know actually walked by John De Lancie on a bridge in Edinburgh and was all "I think I recognize him somehow.."
@The_Extractor_ And I just saw in your pics that you totally used a picture of Q in an argument. I like that too <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@The_Extractor_ Not at all, I like ya :)
@dagwells I understand, if there's one person I apologize to the most it is 'Future Me'
@Esti858 You're just as good a calculadora as I am, you'd be a fine NASA gopher :)
@Esti858 I was just a few days ago talking about how I used to write to NASA as a kid so don't laugh at 8-year old Lando's dreams :)
@Esti858 With Macaroni and cheese and a lot of nervous crying? :)
Oh Snap  
@Esti858 I haven't even begun to look at that yet. All I know is judgement days (plural) are coming up FAST and they'll smite me bad.

[Cut to me stalking hospital corridors, a malevolent angel of death]

I want…
@Esti858 Also take a look at my old colleague/boss who is always good for adventure discussion :) @Tom_Celt
@Esti858 Dude... I have a TMA due in 26 hours.
@Esti858 prepare to get nothing done! 
@LiamLikesThis @Esti858 @EilidhL_ @AddictedToTweed @NursieDear25 @The_Extractor_ She's practically my sister, her first day on Twitter<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@Esti858 know what's amazing, my following' list is literally ME. Like you could build a clone of me from my following and it would be right
@Esti858 Also: @MedievalReacts @AngrySalmond for sure <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Hey buddy @Esti858 here's some good people to follow :) @EilidhL_ @LiamLikesThis @AddictedToTweed @NursieDear25 @The_Extractor_
@Esti858 Ahh you joined twitter! Another way for us to send each other cat pictures :D
@EilidhL_ Yup, sure has been a fun filled Sunday for all. Both far less and far more interesting than what I am supposed to be doing:)
@Alexx_McArthur Umm. How exactly will they be ending them? By ending the austerity and attacks on the poor that led to their use?
@EilidhL_ Handled it very well. But yes, people blocked him and were going "You better delete this" when what he said was really quite mild
@EilidhL_ With absolute lack of irony, as though there is nothing at all divisive about jumping down the throat of anyone who disagrees.
@EilidhL_ Guy on my Facebook earlier today had people calling him every name they could think up for even *suggesting* Sheridan is no hero
@LA_Anders Usually go by capacity but I'm thinkin like these thermal plants must need huge suckers.
Energy nerds, a question: What kind of turbine size are we talking at thermal nuclear facility like a Gen IV reactor? Dimensions?
@AmadahyZ Hey, I'm a little behind on this: May I ask how is this connected to Netflix?
@Smicht This headline absolutely swayed my hypochondria in a new direction 
@paulajradcliffe You've changed things for the better for all women runners &amp; athletes and you're wonderful. Congratulations xx
@I_Whyte You're a wonderful friend for even trying to deceive me with that <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<RAINBOW>
@wendybea So you think this tactical wheel-of-holding-your-nose is actually gaining traction?
@wendybea @SamHeughan Ha. Scotland be like "Dear rest of the world, you're welcome".
@wendybea See I knew there was a reason he's so fine, outwith the triathlons.
@wendybea Was he?! Ah yaaaas <GLOWING STAR><GLOWING STAR>
@wendybea Ooh you're assuming he's  on the same Team! Road to ruin that one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Zarkwan Have a good one <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@Zarkwan The worst is swimsuit season, I just look like someone is reflecting the sun using a mirror
@wendybea We could have an EL/Midlothian ladies night <RAINBOW>
@wendybea That's super, I really hope it goes well (well I mean obviously I do you know <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>)
@wendybea Girl, he is pretty fine, I tell you that
@Zarkwan And white is the only word to describe me, my skin has never even seen the word 'melanin' (I'm like Casper when he feels faint <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>)
@Zarkwan but it's a privilege of being white that referring to our skin colour is not associated with an attempt at dehumanising us
@Zarkwan most recently: good honest words here 
@Zarkwan Also often very different what one group will use to refer to themselves and what is acceptable for another to use about them
@Zarkwan I've actually never heard of anyone not finding coloured a slur tbh. It requires apology today, has since the 80s tbh.
@Zarkwan But as with anything you may find some people prefer something that others don't, there will always be differences in experience <SUNFLOWER>
@Zarkwan Hi Colin :) I commonly use the term POC, as it doesn't imply anything about specific ethnic descent (such as African-American does)
@wendybea Great idea <GLOWING STAR> How's Midlothian shaping up?
@I_Whyte I'm making a snack! And stressing. Mostly stressing.
@wendybea Nope, I'm a desk-jockey today so I'm super glued in place. Pencaitland over in East Lothian <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@I_Whyte I have two more after this. I'm nowhere prepared for exams, and I've two on the same day
@wendybea I've only just realised you're in Dalkeith! How's it going there, neighbour?
@I_Whyte @AddictedToTweed @GeorgeKerevan @JohnPJohnston67 @Garethsocial @EastLothianSNP been at my desk all weekend, big deadline tmw :(
@JohnPJohnston67 @I_Whyte @AlexPatersonSNP High Striker! I was just trying to think of what we call that.. How'd it go? <GRINNING FACE>
@I_Whyte @AddictedToTweed @GeorgeKerevan @EastLothianSNP @JohnPJohnston67 @Garethsocial The return of the mallet! How did it go? <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@wendybea #RuinARomanticMomentIn4Words Mom, Is that you?
@wendybea I've been trying to think of a good one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@The_Extractor_ @EilidhL_ it was certainly an energetic affair when Nicola spoke in August in Prestonpans
@The_Extractor_ yeah, right? It's like saying you're the captain of the ferry port! for me and my bff it's a major point of contention <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@The_Extractor_ @EilidhL_ Ah we've got OOs too, and yes subtlety is not the style I've come to expect
@The_Extractor_ Ah some of the best arguments I've ever had were about Trek and/or my belief that Sisko wasn't a captain.
@The_Extractor_ Also, really letting my TNG flag fly over here <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
@The_Extractor_ Guinan I go two ways on, I like her then I find Whoopie problematic. But, she did save Data that one time soo...
@The_Extractor_ never examined further! Obviously knew each other, went nowhere.
@The_Extractor_ i love Q, IDGAF. He may have been in few episodes but I love him
@je5kby Thanks for your comment :)
@Tom_Celt Calgary Stampede in July. La Tomatina in August! And Iceland Airwaves music festival in November. (Hurrah, credit card debt!)
@Tom_Celt Sea! Paddled past Isle of Eig and slept on the beach. Good pub called Glenuig Inn between Ft William &amp; Mallaig.
Hey Tom, @Tom_Celt I was kayaking in the Highlands last week and thought of you! Have you had any good seawater adventures lately?
Want to feel really old? The film 'The Little Mermaid' was released nearer to the moon landings than to the present day.
@EilidhL_ @AlexPatersonSNP It is indeed, Was even the picture on Nicola's Facebook for a time! Cheeky fella that he is ;)
@EilidhL_ My fav is a pic from last year with a young fella who is incredibly good at getting himself into pictures ;) @AlexPatersonSNP
@madihahansari Cool, that's really good news :)
@madihahansari How have things been lately?
@madihahansari It's my massive privilege that I even have the option of being a bystander in life and not a target
@madihahansari Since then I've reflected on it often, it is my biggest regret.
@madihahansari There was a time on the bus in London in 2007 when I witnessed a racial attack but was so shocked by it I was frozen in place
@scotsmum1966 @traquir We are better than that.
@scotsmum1966 @traquir But we don't get to use racist terms without criticism just because different offensive terms get used against us
But here's the thing. If you witness someone use a racist term you cannot stay silent. Refusing to engage helps literally no one.
@scotsmum1966 @traquir And frankly, if our side use terms that are harmful then it's that much harder for us to hold others to account
@scotsmum1966 @traquir That's why I wanted to call it out, especially if no harm is intended it's not an appropriate term to use
@traquir I just hate hate hate seeing racist terms like c**** tossed around like they don't still hurt POC.
@traquir Sorry Traquir, I think we might be speaking at cross purposes - I'm in no way supporting the branch office and it's failures
Just got called a troll for calling someone out for using a racist term. Apparently that counts as "Divide and rule" now
@scotsmum1966 @traquir @SNP_ForScotland @scottishlabour Jacquie, disagreeing with your use of language does not make me a troll.
@traquir @SNP_ForScotland @scottishlabour No dude, it's completely unacceptable- Why would you think otherwise?
@SNP_ForScotland @traquir bloody hell, you also fail to see that comparing situation here to US &amp; segregation is also really out of order
@SNP_ForScotland @traquir And yet don't realize "Coloured' is *one of the most offensive slurs*. It's not "old-fashioned" it's inappropriate
@SNP_ForScotland @traquir "Coloured' is a Racist term. You used it. For pity sake.
@SNP_ForScotland @traquir You are trying to be cocky about using *A racist term* and you think it's ME with the problem?
@SNP_ForScotland @traquir Did you just use the term coloured and then also compare something to situation for POC in America. F***ing hell
@MikaelAllan @AbbyHoward I only discovered Jr. Science Power Hour because I was searching around on Kickstarter. Really glad I did too :)
@bbrown511 What is this comment even
@The_Extractor_ Worf gets denied: 
See first few minutes, Chris McDougall speaking about Paula Radcliffe and Derartu Tulu &amp; the magic of New York 2009 
Remember it's only since 1972 women were allowed to do marathons: and 43 years later, Paula Radcliffe (age 41) is still finishing below 2:30
@MsiDouglas She's absolutely amazing isn't she
@VanObserver When did BC end up so behind its neighbours to the south
@The_Extractor_ Another #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication the season 7 one where there's Indians and The Traveler comes back for Wesley. Ffs
@MrMalky @wendybea Run doggy!
@The_Extractor_ he's living his best life tho, seen his pics? One day he's a lobster, the next him &amp; Ian McKellan are on Santa's knees
@The_Extractor_ It's just... Come on down Picard, everything will be fine. #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication 
Also that one Star Trek TNG ep that had Data doing all the different voices, wearing that mask. Wtf was that #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication
That one Star Trek TNG episode where Tasha Yar got killed by Armus (RIP) #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication




Cc @Copwatch
The day we lost Crystal Pepsi  #WorstCrisisSinceTheAbdication 
@The_Extractor_ @EilidhL_ A lot of it was news to me, I'm not from Scotland originally so it's not something I was very familiar with
@TottyRocksLtd I hope you don't plan on changing career anytime soon because I'm saving for a business suit and dress :)
@The_Extractor_ @EilidhL_ I get the impression if it wasn't it wouldn't have been able to stay up all these years, given the situation
And if you want to help Nepal donate to a group that really gets shit done:  MSF are heroes 
@MSF_uk Are sending 4 teams to Nepal today. They're some of the hardest, toughest, bravest most amazing people and they're on the way!
@MSF_uk Go with the good will of all people x

Other disasters are preventable, with work.

Step up on all fronts!

…
@madihahansari Hey not at all, just wanting to be courteous <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Hey @EilidhL_ did you see this? Super long &amp; detailed article on Sheridan from SSY 
@madihahansari cool, thank you! My usual 'have a nice time' seemed really awkward, especially when someone is fasting <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@madihahansari Thanks:) Is there a preferred phrase for wishing someone well at the start of Ramadan? Like 'Happy Holidays' type of thing
@madihahansari Would you mind if I ask a question? (About Ramadan, non hijab-related)
@RiaDRobertson @imsarcastic Happy Birthday <PARTY POPPER><BIRTHDAY CAKE>
@sacha_coward @LetToysBeToys @SmiffysUK Or Ching Shih! She commanded over 20,000 pirates! 
@kittycatlitter I did it in November. I resolved to just trust it 100% and just follow it to the letter. Genuine life change.
There's something fascinating about a PR car crash. Phillip Morris and Kenneth Cole are still my favs, but we sure have a new contender
@DanielFurrUK @Leadinglady0609 'English dolls for English kids' I can see it now
@LiamLikesThis But the PR meltdown is absolutely amazing. 
@LiamLikesThis Just a few specifics I spotted when I checked out the hashtag. I think if you say the word 'feminist' three times they appear
@LiamLikesThis Looking at who has waded into the fray to support them is like a Who's who of people to avoid.
@canvascomfort You alright?
@blethers @theSNP Is that you in the pic? You look so chuffed! :D
But kids cutting dolls hair is "Devilish". It's like @Scarfolk
The UK really is a fascinating place. Chasing terrified animals and watching them be ripped to pieces while they're still living is 'Sport'
@LiamLikesThis I also really like the hashtag.
@patronsaintofca It was the 90s! I didn't know! I DIDN"T KNOW!
@LiamLikesThis Yes. An actual bit about how Nicola cut dolls hair as a child. I kid you not, that's where we're at politically now.
Since we're confessing our DollCrimes today... 
I left a my little pony under the deck all winter, and in the spring it was GONE. #DollGate
Also: No male politician has EVER had an article written questioning his ability to govern based on how he played with toys as a child, ever
I'm unfit for politics. I used to put eyeshadow on the dog and I made Luke Skywalker and Han Solo get married. (Barbie officiated) #DollGate
@endlondonrule @dagwells That's such a get out of jail free card isn't it. Like 'nevermind dear, it's beyond you anyways'
@EilidhL_ I skipped straight to Aragorn. #notsorry but at least no one was on Team Bean.
@EilidhL_ Know who is no ones favourite? Legolas. There I said it.
@endlondonrule @dagwells I thought they said patriotism is bad. It's like the political version of dietary cholesterol advice.
@EilidhL_ for pure cheese: Sam going 'I can carry you!!' And also the bit where they clink mugs in Hobbiton and no one has any idea.
@EilidhL_ Although I think it's a tough call bec I appreciate TT and ROTK for different reasons
@EilidhL_ I concur!
@EilidhL_ Is Tom much in the animated film? I think he was.
@EilidhL_ lol, two LOTR Twitter accounts just followed me. Such is the power of a good discussion <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@EilidhL_ Ahh I got to disagree, I found Tom Bombadil a dull part of the book and prob would've just made the beginning feel much longer
@EilidhL_ in the directors cut you just get that one gaze across the room when Aragorn has healed her with his power of nobility.
@EilidhL_ total male gaze service tbh. Spent first 3 films making Gimli the comic relief, no one will then find little hairy women 'pretty'
@EilidhL_ Eowyn never felt tacked on, she was just right. Not a huge amount of time for development but a whole character nonetheless
@EilidhL_ It just felt like pure "we need a girl, who do we have..."
Friday night and I got my pizza and I'm at home writing about thermal fission reactors because #YOLO ya jelly bro
@EilidhL_ I struggle with the anonymity, increasing women's participation takes women being visible and active, but Comfy Lórien cloak tho
@EilidhL_ <THUMBS UP SIGN> what'd you think of the last trilogy?
@EilidhL_ And the thing is even tweeting about this I still won't get any attention. It's like I got that kick-ass hobbit cloak from LOTR.
@EilidhL_ oh yeah, if there's one thing a woman who identifies openly as a feminist needs it is *lots of stuff explained to her*.
@EilidhL_ It is funny yeah! I have no doubt if I replace my bear (looking just like I do at work) with me at work, it'd change, mysteriously
@EilidhL_ @unsavourycabal Yup. He tried hard to listen to Robin McAlpine on YouTube but normal speech it's just a bit too soft for him
@EilidhL_ My picture &amp; name don't mention my gender, nor do I identify publicly as a feminist, and somehow, magically, I'm always off radar!
@EilidhL_ Also: notice we've similar followers, tweet often similar stuff, but you get argued with and I don't - And coincidentally (cont)
@EilidhL_ @unsavourycabal My dad likes Tommy, but for very specific reason: he's almost deaf, Tommy always shouts. He can't hear the others
@ProspectorFilms Hello! Thanks for your message. I am based in Scotland, so it looks like importing a copy on DVD will be best :)

@1974Hamilton @OwenJones84 I know eh, everyone needs a dream
Please keep an eye out! Man missing from Hurlford East Ayrshire, name is Bud Gibson. See picture in tweet.  
@Amanwy @elainerae4 Boy do I know how that feels!
Golly, this guy is emotional! Look how his face is all mushed up with feelings. (I understand, I missed my nap too) 
@elainerae4 @brimunro @chunkymark And you don't need to spend your life having politics be something that is done TO you
@1974Hamilton @OwenJones84 I dream of fleeing to Costa Rica or Uruguay but that has nothing to do with GE.
@brimunro @elainerae4 @chunkymark It's not just that voters across UK should expect better, they need to know that they *deserve* better.
@EilidhL_ @RobertJSomynne Not at all! There are terrific cartoons for a variety of bad internet comments: 
@EilidhL_ @RobertJSomynne Well you already dispatch sealions  pretty swiftly, so I don't know that it'd be that big a time saver
@EilidhL_ @RobertJSomynne Incidentally, there is also no Douchebag emoji. <SHOWER><PILE OF POO>
@RobertJSomynne @EilidhL_ And yet with our terrifically expanded repertoire of emoji the closest to a sealion is still <SNAIL> or possibly <SPOUTING WHALE>
@AngrySalmond And at the end of the month we dance &amp; get nudie around a fire! (I know what you're thinking, why wait til end of the month?)

@EilidhL_ oh yeah, something in the air alright (eau de privilège masculin).
@EilidhL_ Not even noon and that's probably enough internet for me today. Ugh.
@EilidhL_ It is an accurate term.
@EilidhL_ Well at least this pro-disease group has an awful-record to try and beat.
@EilidhL_ The worst was when PETA used the murder of Canadian women to draw a parallel to treatment of farm animals. *During the trial*.
@EilidhL_ I was just thinking/typing that but deleted it because I wasn't sure it would make sense in context. And yes.
@EilidhL_ it is almost the worst I've seen.
@EilidhL_ I'm completely unable to process this.
@EilidhL_ WHAT.
@patronsaintofca Poe's Law! 
@shocker38 eh?
Abolish your Human Rights!!

@GrayInGlasgow @patronsaintofca @JamieRoss7 SaunaRepublic! Can we, Can we please!?
@LA_Anders 2 kids from down the road have joined in "There's a lot of belts between red and black" "I DIDNAE say it's a black belt did I"
Listening to neighbour kids argue about karate belts "Red belt is almost black belt" "YOURE HAVING A LAUGH MATE NAW" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@howlinhounddog @brewdog Same, just nabbed a few shares. I've never been anything approaching hip though, so I'll leave the punk to you :)
@heyItsMichael94 Nooo I was just going to do this, curse you! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DeadStar83 @TheEdinburgNews This is terrible. I hope the victim is ok x
@GrrlGhost I'd have loved a second parent that loved me back, absolutely yes.
@1974Hamilton I was defeating you allll along!

@YesEquality2015 You absolutely have my support. Canada celebrates 10th anniversary of marriage equality this summer, and it's excellent <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Think it's very cool the SNP had a launch at EICA Ratho. It's a good facility and deserves the publicity &amp; people that work there are nice <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@malinheenallan @theSNP @TrossachsSNP @NicolaSturgeon I empathise, my family barely survived the Nazis, so that slur always really stung me
Ireland you are so great. Yes Equality, Yes Love! 
@wendybea @pinesbloke @MrMalky @vickymummyrc @flyingdavy @patronsaintofca Yes. Thank the light for that one
@wendybea @patronsaintofca They used to send pens &amp; badges and I was probably insufferable about it <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

@wendybea @patronsaintofca Daw:) I can be like: Dear NASA, my little Jamie wants an autograph, please make it out to 'Anders'.
@wendybea @patronsaintofca Tho if I wrote to them today al least my handwriting would still be the same as the 80s. still in crayon too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@wendybea @MrMalky @vickymummyrc @flyingdavy @patronsaintofca They respond to kids letters! 'And not with 'stop writing to us, stupid kid'
@wendybea @MrMalky @vickymummyrc @flyingdavy @patronsaintofca I used to write to NASA. If I thought it wouldn't be weird now I still would:)
This is a great video x 
@minigong Ugh, was just my blood pressure going up over someone sending cruel tweets. There's so many better ways to spend that energy
@itvnews Thank you for using the word people to refer to the victims, most of the news has failed to do that.

@zdanivsky Hey, what HR monitor and software do you use? Does it measure distance between beats?
@Hollie_Sneddon @MrMalky I don't get it. Surely if you wanted a Tory gov you'd...vote tory?
@redbreastedbird @loveitloveit @afharrold @LetToysBeToys @LEGO_Group Yup it's true, I'm always welding stuff wrong.
@loveitloveit @afharrold @LetToysBeToys @LEGO_Group ... Hmm, mine haven't been doing that, I've just been getting the Cantina Band.
@loveitloveit @afharrold @LetToysBeToys @LEGO_Group Dammit, You mean it was the ovaries all along? Boy do I feel foolish.
@afharrold @LetToysBeToys @LEGO_Group It could just have said "inspiring LEGO Star Wars models for kids" But that would be SILLY right?
@SNP_ForScotland That sounds great too :D We could just as easily (Far more easily) been soaked wet with wind, was real good fortune

Look out everybody, we have a tough guy over here! 
@WomanOnTheBoard @BBCr4today Yup. No man in any performance review is criticised for being confident or for being strong
@WomanOnTheBoard @MagiGibson @BBCr4today See also: Emotional, abrasive, shrill, over-confident, too strong... It's the Double Bind.
@EilidhL_ @The_Extractor_ There IS some gaslighting too in that it's not 'agree-to-disagree' but instead 'you're wrong/irrational' etc
@The_Extractor_ @EilidhL_ <THUMBS UP SIGN> See also: 
@EilidhL_ @The_Extractor_ tbh I think your sense that using the 'F' word + getting these comments is linked is completely right.
@EilidhL_ @The_Extractor_ Oh yeah, I'm just looking. you must be at the harbour this evening because you got a sealion on ya deck.
@EilidhL_ @The_Extractor_ Are they of the sealion variety or the gaslight variety? Or both! (I bet it's both).
@Filthy_Paws I don't know if there's charges yet. It's just terrible :(
@Filthy_Paws I think it's just held so far. I think they have to arrest him in order to question him
@thinhungrygirl I just don't think I'm that much of an outlier either, I'd prob go for Leningrad or resistance movements
@guardiannews WHY. Why does the abuse of children mean nothing compared to the desire for power.

@thinhungrygirl I can't imagine that, I mean I can't imagine thinking THAT is what you'd pick.
@RebeccahLouise Yup. "She must have done something wrong, I can avoid that because I'm good and I do the right things instead"
@RebeccahLouise My view is the transfer of guilt onto victims is a socialisation to make ourselves stop fearing our own risk of victimhood
@thinhungrygirl Wait. Wait what? Of all the things during that time period they assumed you'd go for *textile* what!
@RebeccahLouise It had already started yesterday.

@SNP_ForScotland @lilaclily4 @BBCScotlandNews Diminish the empire eh? Good. Bye.
@andy_murray @evil_del Done! If I win please just give it to a local charity to auction instead. Have a good one, congratulations to you :)
@MrMalky @FalconerBrian @Ed_Miliband @Margaret_Curran oh dear god
All that matters is we rationalise our own fear of victimhood away by foisting guilt onto the victimised. Then all we need do is be 'good'
People victim blame because it's how we rationalise away our own fears.
F*** this person. Karen is missing, loved ones are in hell, but you just gotta jump in there anyway. screw you. 
@bmc875 you know I read that about ten times before I noticed I spelled teams not trams!
@bmc875 That sounds like Captain Atom to me. 
@bmc875 Wasn't SNP actually against the teams because they said the business case didn't hold up?
@1974Hamilton @LouiseZuzu @nufab4 @weenoonie @DaveMBall Next year: 'The wristband can be hidden by clothes. Maybe slide it up the arm?'

@NursieDear25  @PeteDoc1986 @Scotsfox Ahh, this is the guy that said every breath we draw offends him, now he thinks he's super gentile eh.
@NursieDear25 It's actions that matter, and beauty doesn't mask meanness on the inside. But also: What does blue rinse mean? :D
@NursieDear25 I'm confused.
@mogabee3 @GerryHassan Sorry if I was unclear, I didn't actually read it so assumed is a quote from Blair, Was a comment on his actions:)

@MrMo_J @scottishbktrust exception* I absolutely am going to read Andy Weir's The Martian.
@MrMo_J @scottishbktrust They're great books (I mean obviously I think my taste is great <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>) but I am missing out on  other perspectives
@MrMo_J @scottishbktrust I got myself a big stack of works particularly women from Africa and also from China and I'm broadening my range
@MrMo_J @scottishbktrust I did an audit and realised about 92% of my books were by western guys (and most of the 8% was Atwood) so (cont)
@scottishbktrust @MrMo_J I'm re-reading Guns, Germs &amp; Steel before launching into a massive wall of fiction.

@RebeccahLouise no worries! Looking at your recent tweets, you def get some, uhh.. "interesting" people commenting at you on the regular<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RebeccahLouise Unfortunately the world will never be rid of D-bags, useless though they are. You did right in calling it out too <GLOWING STAR>
@RebeccahLouise @CiarasTagAlong yup and context is everything here tbh. There's nothing wrong with the way you perceived it.
@RebeccahLouise you don't scare someone as a "joke" to get them to stop tweeting you. that's not what that was at all.
@CiarasTagAlong @RebeccahLouise That was the impression it gave me as well like "I'll drop this little statement in casually to rattle you"
And um... yeah, talking about your neighbours and friends and fellow citizens as "Evil disease" IS indeed very 1930s-ish language...
Gosh, he sounds upset! 
@MrMo_J @Dawnrodger I'm just getting caught up on this. Some people in life are just jerks. It's no reflection on you or what you do xx
@patronsaintofca @carolynleckie @jamieszymko @paulhutcheon it'll be another 'managed decline', there's no other way. Such a shame too

@patronsaintofca @mathcampbell @MgtFerrierSNP Onion rings too. This was a complete day.
@mathcampbell @patronsaintofca @MgtFerrierSNP If today was anything to go by Salted Caramel chocolate. And, later, liposuction.
@1974Hamilton @MrMo_J There's also Galaxy eggs. It's like a whole new world
It's still 6 months until Bjork opens Iceland Airwaves at Harpa but i'm so looking forward to it I would skip the summer to be there now.
@1974Hamilton @MrMo_J Presumably in the fridge, tomorrow's gonna be a sunny day.
@1974Hamilton @MrMo_J Also, Creme eggs are now available 365 days a year so this need not be a springtime affair, have it when you want it:)
@MrMo_J @1974Hamilton The important thing is that we've all learned something about ourselves, our manicuring habits, and our friends.
@EilidhL_ It's devaluing women's views &amp; opinions. Rather than say "Oh? Sorry you felt that way" it's denial by "make you doubt". Maddening.
Oops upside your head #BadChoiceFuneralSongs
@EilidhL_ It's a form of gaslighting. "It was not, you're just irrational/overreacting/insert word to try &amp; make you doubt your own opinion"
Looking at some screen grabs from this evenings debate. My word but Nicola has THE BEST SIDE-EYE. She throws tremendous shade. I dig it.
@MrRaffaelli I don't know why exactly the greens were left out. Did stv give any explanation?
@Joe__Monty The Labour one asks 'Coldplay or Kasabian' and 'JFK or Reagan' it's not exactly an analysis yeah.
@jamieszymko I only got 90% because I like coke TOO. Test is rigged <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@zer0deConduit @Fanilow19 @GM8LFB Same here! Man in our house got one addressed to him exclusively. Presumably he'll let me know what to do
In fact if one thing gives heart it's that the number that protested in 2003 for Peace was enormous and broad. 
Tony had over 750,000 citizens in Hyde Park protest for peace. the kinda people that might've been Labour voters. Then he started war anyway
Well now Ed has secured the "Recent war criminal" backing I'm sure it'll be smooth sailing. Everyone knows that's the key to success. /s
If anyone should impart wisdom unto us, it's Tony Blair. That man has never made a single misstep off the righteous path! Oh Wait hang on..
@traquir @AGlesca disappointed, kinda sad, but more just weary tbh
@AGlesca @traquir nothing's shocking
OK yeah the salted caramel galaxy bar is also pretty great. Everything about this trend is great.
@indyrefolizer @NursieDear25 Is he saying he wants Nicola to be remembered and celebrated religiously by millions 2000 years from now?
He does have the kind of perfectly manicured lawn &amp; garden to give you an inferiority complex, but he says he finds it meditative <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@IslaAitken What's the train like? And how long? :)
@IslaAitken Ha! Humble brag ;)

Unless of course you are a really terrible person, I guess that kind of trumps any rules of engagement humans might regularly have.
you should NOT comment on that persons "due diligence" and "decision making" An idea worth taking on board, yeah? Yeah. 2/2
I know, groundbreaking stuff, really a new way of doing things, but when speaking to someone that had to run to a shelter,  just maybe  1 /2
Communication lesson: When talking to a woman that has experienced domestic violence, you shouldn't say "Choose your men carefully" Just FYI

We have already lost so much history and art, sometimes through wilful destruction, other times just through lack of consideration

@jools_organic @scottishliberal @wheelingwhaup I dunno, he seems more of a hibiscus complexion to me
@scottishliberal @jools_organic @wheelingwhaup I believe SilkNatural lipstick causing the Pout. Possibly in 'strut'<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@scottishliberal @jools_organic @wheelingwhaup I keep thinking it spells sn-Pout and I ponder what the SN is (possibly a plumping lipstick)
@HHamwich Piers Morgan is the awful filling in that awful sandwich. Rupert Murdoch is the awful sauce.
@HHamwich Oh yeah that is really a `Who's Who' of Britain Today
@KAlmsivi Happy birthday! <GLOWING STAR>
@albertblau Sí entenc el teu anglès. / Sí entiendo, su Inglés es bien :)
@albertblau Sí entenc el teu anglès. Gràcies pels seus missatges.
@albertblau Ho sentim, estic escrivint en espanyol, però crec que està escrivint en català
@albertblau Yo veo. Estoy conmocionado por esta falta de emoción humana
@albertblau Está bien, me lleva tiempo, pero todavía estoy aprendiendo :) Si el español es más fácil para usted que está bien
@esmusat What a rotten person. Usted es *papelera*. Proferir basura absoluta.
@albertblau @patronsaintofca Mi español no es grande, pero he visto algunos tweets chocante. ¡Es horrible, quién dice que esas cosas!
@qvlts It's Scottish/Glasgow banter - It means "I'm not a snitch"
@ochtannie Bingo! 
@ochtannie Isn't that entire field mostly little raw evidence and instead just reinforces status-quo patriarchal ideals with "teh science"
@ChrisCuomo Well the most important thing is that we speculate as to their motives while they come to terms with their coworkers dying today
@WellNowUniverse @sueveneer Sometimes I just can't anymore.
@sueveneer @WellNowUniverse oh god
@YahooNews What makes you think it's a good thing to use pictures of grieving families to get clicks.
@LillyLyle @Interdome You do not!
@LiamLikesThis I think 300 and Top Gun were my two favs. And Game of Thrones. Actually I love almost all of them :D They do games too
@LiamLikesThis 
@LiamLikesThis Just read your Maze Runner review, did you see the Honest Trailer for it? :)
@JohannaWestberg But the research I've done everything says do Deadlifts, Bench &amp; Power squats but not what to do if you don't have those:)
@JohannaWestberg Thanks! It's just attached to the local swimming pool so it's just a small place, but my view was it is better than nothing
@sweden It's the only one in my area + is affordable. I don't really feel confident enough for barbell stuff yet tbh
@sweden but thanks for the fabulous picture anyway <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sweden just joined nearby gym that doesn't have any free weights. I heard smith doesn't allow for same range but is closest substitute
@sweden Smith machine - as good as power squats w/barbell?
@RozKaveney @lookitmoves OMG, she is so cool.

@Tucker5law @euan_hart An Ayn Rand fan that thinks he is like, the hardest worker like, ever :)
@1974Hamilton yeah man come out into the light, it's springtime <TULIP>
@FalconerBrian @AngrySalmond @AlexSalmond £70
@1974Hamilton Nope. Ebola is like a firecracker, this was a bigger &amp; unprecedented one, but it always burns itself out in time
@LillyLyle @Dr_Ellie I know right? One of the coolest things we've ever done. People like Jonas Salk are the best ones we have had.

@Sparkle__Monkey @MhairiHunter @JournoStephen @WingsScotland Sausage roll, hot men, coffee, tea... Why not have both?
@Independent @Alexlac51 What an odd thing to say, more Roman leaders were assassinated by their Praetorian guards than by any other means
@wendybea @ChristinaSNP @newsundayherald @ileenemac It's a calling :)
@euan_hart I know right, can't trust anyone these days
@clairerobsc1 @DrDavidPatrick @my_daily_gripe @alicmurray honestly it just makes me sad.
@euan_hart It was a very old East Europe yellow car. They turned it into 2 motorised skateboards which I was told were not road legal.
@DrDavidPatrick @my_daily_gripe @clairerobsc1 @alicmurray I don't think this person actually knows what a civil war is like. It's not this.
Know why you shouldn't eat cheese before bed? Because if you do Davos Seaworth &amp; Humza Yousaf will come to the gym and dismantle your car.
#FF Street Food Edinburgh - Tastiness can be yours. @alplings @FoodsScoff @eatninjabuns

@CJuliaSM @Alan94943888 So why denigrate their independence movement against being brutally repressed. You're cool with that?
@CJuliaSM @Alan94943888 Up to 1 million Tibetans died in decade after being forcibly 'incorporated' by China in 1950, you know that right?
@my_daily_gripe I'm certain I've seen a site that collects all the times people take The Onion seriously, it was a thing of beauty
@my_daily_gripe was   in this: I used to get in trouble with my dad if I read it 
@my_daily_gripe Omg you're right! That's probably what tmw solar eclipse is all about <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> (coincidence that you warned me the day before? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>)
@my_daily_gripe Seriously, even had a date/time calling on patriotic Americans to counter-jump and save the world :) That's still my fav
@my_daily_gripe I used to love insane conspiracy articles in the 90s, like 'China is going to jump all at once to knock us out of orbit'
@SparkyBhoyHH @AamerAnwar @AngrySalmond @policescotland Yes it was &amp; yes you are. Your comment is indefensible. no place for you here.
@offshorewinduk Do you think we'll eventually see wide scale adoption of high-altitude tethered wind technology to tap into the jet stream?
@etribune @LaughingNoam What words did the UK press &amp; Government use in obituaries for the Saudi King? Cautious reformer.
@RobertJSomynne @DanLeePadgett I thought Kahlua was a more natural Oreo Tuesday morning milkshake accompaniment, but I can be convinced
@FionaCarmichae1 Ha! Why wouldn't they want to go zorbing, it looks ridiculously fun!
@flcro @YesAlliance59 @Caledonia_1 @YsabelleStewart My take away from that: Someone used dastardly in a sentence! Think it's Errol Flynn? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FlossMorgan @LaughingNoam @GreenRupertRead Great quote sums up my view 
@djolder Toni Morrison had the words 'A hot thing' getting into my head for *days* after Beloved. Happened each time I read it
@susaniindy @d3sola @divyabaji @STEMNET I remember my dad taking me to see how steam turbines work. My hard hat and boots were so big on me<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
