It just would have been nice if my last year in the band wasn't cut short because of a rule that was either bullshit or not enforced.
I remember specifically asking if the "no bass players" rule was only for the NCAA tournament and not applicable to conference tournaments.
I guess that "no bass players allowed" rule only applies to members of the ECU pep band named John Blackstock
So I can't go to the tournament because bass players aren't allowed but Houston still brings a bass player??

Pretty sure we fought a war so we didn't have to follow the so-called "Royal Protocol" when meeting members of the Royal Family.
Dixieland jazz players could really swing <FLUSHED FACE>

If my professor forgets to show up for the final he scheduled on reading day, heads will roll.
Finally mastered the art of putting in contacts without a mirror <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I wish our school was good at basketball. <PENSIVE FACE>
Verb, that's what's happening.
@ErinMarohn skim milk: that's right, I tweeted about it twice. Avoid it.
Hockey players are fucking insane.
Skim milk: Avoid it.
My mental state takes a nosedive sometimes when I'm a practice room this long.
Wouldn't that blocked field goal have been a live ball?
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTB--- oh look it's already 0-7 <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Does this song really have a 13 bar form? #thefuck
Definitely didn't just do an involuntary backflip out of my chair <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Thou shalt use thy fucking turn signals.
Do I have to pay someone or..?
Where can I sign up to fast forward to Thursday?
@SportsCenter @ErinMarohn the 49ers lost Erin.

also the packers
Where the hell did these Panthers come from?
I never remember my dreams but for the past month every single one I remember involves my phone screen getting cracked.
Today's NFL action is irrelevant because the best team in the world plays tomorrow instead.
Ohio State's in the playoff. Baylor and TCU can bitch about it when the Big 12 has a championship game.
That's the difference between teams that win championships and he ones that lose on a Hail Mary that never should have been been attempted.
@ECUPirateCannon literally the same situation. Opponent even has one timeout
ECU coaches should pay attention
Let's all watch how the Seminoles deal with this situation. So far no designed QB sacks. Strange
That seems strangely familiar.
Oh wow. Florida state has a slight lead with good field position with 1:47 on the clock and the opponent has one timeout.
Awww shit Packers on Monday Night Football.
Why doesn't anyone ever question that there's a talking stuffed kangaroo in the Dish Network commercials?
Don Johnson sighting <EYES>
Literally about to die of exhaustion.
I'm seeing all these highlights from the Hornets on my Instagram feed but they can't win a game <UNAMUSED FACE>
At this rate the @Sixers might be able to get to a 5-77 record <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
ECU basketball makes me want to cry.
Pretty sure my improv professor won't stop until I'm dead
Definitely didn't start practicing at 7 like originally planned.
What did I want to be doing tonight? Well it certainly wasn't staying up until midnight learning a Dixieland jazz song from the 20s <UNAMUSED FACE>
Why are there always people shouting outside my apartment?
I really feel for the sax players that are practicing broken thirds. I was like you once. <PENSIVE FACE>
@jbstock2 
@jbstock2 YES
WWE is actually coming to ECU <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Remember when people comparing Aaron Rodgers and Alex Smith and speculating on which would be better? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I think we all can agree who's the number one team in the NFL.
‚Äú@packers: Touchdown #Packers, 45-yd pass to Nelson. #NEvsGB 
There's not a word in the English language to describe how badly the Packers are going to beat the Patriots.
ESPN camera guy needs to chill.
Being an Oakland Raiders fan will at least give you the skill of dealing with crushing disappointment #notcompletelyworthless

First thing people ask on the DD thanksgiving message on Facebook is if we're open or not. Glad to see everyone's in the holiday mood.
There are some seriously cringeworthy photos going up on social media today.
On the bright side, Friends is coming to Netflix.

Who am I kidding I'm not going to practice right now.

@ErinMarohn basically you just threw in the towel so...
@ErinMarohn random side fact, Shakespeare is now following me on Twitter. How do you like them <RED APPLE><RED APPLE><RED APPLE>
@ErinMarohn HAHAHA THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
@ErinMarohn MAYBE I'M LURING YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY ERIN EVER THINK OF THAT?
@ErinMarohn actually my last tweet was stupid I win at sarcasm
@ErinMarohn maybe we're just both full of shit and we're going to keep blowing the fuck up out of Twitter until one of us loses. #realtalk
@ErinMarohn OR MAYBE I'm so good at sarcasm I knew what you meant and responded saying how good I actually am - check and mate <FLEXED BICEPS>
@ErinMarohn sarcasm is the language of my people. It's been passed down through generation upon generation of Blackstocks. #marohnscanthang
@ErinMarohn I'll try to follow Erin Marohn's golden standard for what constitutes a "good tweet" in the future #notsarcasticatall
@ElMelanson you're telling me.. @frazierdevin and I have been getting bitched at for our quarter notes all semester <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@ElMelanson I'm still working on quarter notes. They can be a bitch.
@ErinMarohn I should know better with you following me though
@ErinMarohn so many falsehoods in that list. And to think I was hoping for a night without constantly being berated. <PENSIVE FACE>
@ErinMarohn and my logic is solid.
@ErinMarohn if you say so. I wonder if a judge would think the same way? *saves conversation for evidence*
@ErinMarohn <FLUSHED FACE> Erin with the death threat coming out of left field.
@ErinMarohn true art is never appreciated in its time. <DIZZY SYMBOL>
@ErinMarohn one funny tweet in a blue moon doesn't make up for vast majority of beautiful tweets I've tweeted through the years.
@ErinMarohn Shakespeare would be jealous of the poetic brilliance of my tweets.
@ErinMarohn maybe I favorite them ironically. Or maybe I'm just favoriting them to make you feel better since no one else will.
@ErinMarohn my tweets are solid gold. Don't hate because you can't compete. <RAISED HAND>
Trying to enjoy the few hours of free time I get this week but @ErinMarohn has other plans <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
@ErinMarohn you really want to trash talk the Pack right now? What was the score Sunday against a team the 49ers LOST to? I forget
If I don't get a cookout milkshake I'm going to literally die.

@hornets do any of the players know what a defensive rebound is?
Even though he was at my combo audition. #finebyme
Pretty sure my history of jazz professor has no idea that I'm a music major.
I swear they're trying to steam us out of these fucking practice rooms
@packers none of them, since we're going to the super bowl <DIZZY SYMBOL>
If my sister chooses UNC I'm going to disown her.
Ray Lewis needs to lose that hat pronto.
"Nothing says happy holidays like a shovel."
Where were these Panthers 2 hours ago?
The problem about Mark Sanchez is that his name is Mark Sanchez.
Ham Newton.
That national anthem was on point
Kind of ironic when the commercial with Suddenlink bragging about their reliability keeps cutting in and out.
Lakers are really just concerned about Charles Barkley's health.
@neiltyson I'm not entirely sold on gravity. #teachthecontroversy
As soon as Kobe released that free throw you could hear him say "ah shit!" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Kobe needs to stop playing hero ball.
Aaron Rodgers is a video game
Game over
@BSimmons25 shouldn't have signed Cutler to such a pricey contract.
Maybe if Jay Cutler gets $10 million more he'll suddenly be a good QB.
Aaron Rodgers: 9-‚Ä¶
Packers 45, Bears 6
@ErinMarohn I can do this all day
@ErinMarohn every time I talk to you in the school of music 
@ErinMarohn keep sippin on that Haterade 
@ErinMarohn also the Packers are publicly owned #americasteam
@ErinMarohn all I'm saying is the Rams had a backup QB in there and Kap still couldn't pull it out 
@ErinMarohn your record suggests otherwise. Would the greatest team on the planet lose to the RAMS (<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>) by fumbling on the goal line?
@ErinMarohn where else would you get your cheese? I don't remember the last time San Fransisco was relevant to my life
@ErinMarohn DON'T YOU SPEAK ILL OF THE PACKERS. AARON RODGERS IS ABOUT TO GO HAM ON CHICAGO WATCH.
@ErinMarohn HATRED IS MUTAL ERIN. But I'm not a Steelers fan. Nice try though A for effort <GLOWING STAR>
So I'm pretty sure I could make a 23 harder so Steelers go ahead and give me a call whenever.
How the fuck do you miss a 23 yard field goal?
Vick and Harvin looking good.
@ErinMarohn <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

This @Panthers touchdown brought to you courtesy of the officials in this game. If that was a taunt I have 3 arms.

@RealSkipBayless Because the rule makes no sense. NCAA has more of a right to use your name and make money than you do? C'mon man.
49ers are desperately trying to lose a game they should easily win.
More like the New York Dwarves.
@RealSkipBayless so  is Stephen A planning on wearing Romo, Bryant or Murray jersey?
#SC3stars goes to the American (soon to be fcs) refs at the USF-ECU game. Calling late hits for hits before the whistle <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> bravo 10/10.

Never in doubt with @Capn_Carden5 and @FreakMagic2 out there. #ecu
Horrible. Absolutely horrible. @American_Conf control your refs.
The refs literally blew a penalty on Justin Hardy for hitting the guy BEFORE THE PLAY ENDED.
A lot of excessive ecu-ness flags in this game.
I mean why the fuck
2nd time in a row we fail on 3rd and long by running the ball???
Louisville just got SCREWED by the refs. Blatant pass interference in the endzone by Clemson. WOW.

If the Bears could lose though that'd be great.
Alright these Jets don't have a chance unless they decide to start playing with some attitude right now.
Still don't understand why the Jets don't start Vick. Or at least use him for something better than these obvious wildcat plays
Jets should be starting Michael Vick. Better to have a veteran in there who's still got some gas in his tank right now and have Geno develop
@Capn_Carden5 that's SMU two weeks from now
I mean 
@ESPNCFB ECU at 42? Behind Virginia Tech? Seriously?
<EYES>
Oh the irony of the College Football Playoff commercial with the LSU dude talking about "liking our chances this year" during this game.
If @espn could stop ignoring a team that was ranked in the AP last week getting blown out by 29 points that'd be great. @SportsCenter
So in other news, Mississippi State is crushing LSU...?

This is like Alabama playing First Flight High School.
I mean, I could probably run in a touchdown on Tampa Bay right now.
These are the best football players in the world right...?
49-0
A blown snap putting the Falcons at the 1. I don't even know what I'd do if I were a Bucs fan. <FLUSHED FACE>
0-35 with 7:00 left in the 2nd quarter. This is unreal
This Atlanta game is going to resemble the ECU game this weekend.

The Buccaneers have more turnovers than competed passes right now.

NFC North is in comeback mode today. First the Packers now the Bears. Lions missed the memo and idgaf about the Vikings.
Bears still suck though.
THAT'S a catch.
Wtf is going on in this game?

Holy shit. <EYES>
That's $126 million worth of offense for the Bears.

@_YUNGPRINCE_4 had a nasty dunk tonight from @keemrich1 #SCTop10
Everyone's talking about how much they hate Flappy Bird and instead of downloading it I'm just all like 
Does this dude seriously have a picture of pie as his Facebook profile picture?  Come on bro.
@yoitsbellaphant hey the parents are paying might as well try it <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@yoitsbellaphant been here since 6:50 - I want my damn food <TIRED FACE>
Am I the only person on the planet that goes through with plans or...?
I can't believe the federal government is looking at information we voluntarily post on the internet.  Bastards
Sorta crazy that I saw a game in the same stadium that the Super Bowl is being played in today.
Say what you will about Richard Sherman, but he's basically made himself the face of the Seahawks franchise with that rant.
Not saying I like the Biebs, but it's not like he was shooting up heroin.
I think it's funny how the same people that are calling Justin Bieber a drug addict are the same people that want to legalize weed.
All you bastards buying up the condensed milk for snow cream are fucking up my flan making plans.
That's some fucked up repugnant shit right there.
And if it's not bad enough that we kill the cows, we then take their skin and turn it into things to carry our money in.
Oh god these pro bowl uniforms are ugly as hell.
KISS sound almost as bad as how the Kings are playing.  #StadiumSeries
@Panthers lol are you serious?
A whole year
Doc Rivers always looks so sad.
It's weird to think that tweet could put me in prison in Russia.
Putin is a fucking asshole.
Fack the 49ers.  Maybe the Panthers can make Kaepernick cry again.
I want to be Meshuggah when I grow up.
Blake Griffin's just warming up for the dunk contest now damn...
43 points in the first quarter... SMH
lolLakers.
I just sneeze-burped.  This must be what death feels like.
‡≤†_‡≤†
Time to fire Dom Capers.  Too many games where you can directly blame the D for the loss
The head coach for the Saints looks like the biggest greaseball.
Oklahoma adding insult to injury against the current national champs #dayum
Chicago simply can't go all the way with Cutler
Whelp.  Bears just signed a 7 year deal to stay mediocre and out of the Super Bowl through 2020.  Looks like the Packer dominance continues.
Holy shit Anderson Silva....

@ShaneM252 dafuq
Weird, I can almost see the Golden State jersey under the refs shirts.  #wow
These NBA Christmas unis look terrible.
Gotta love @Microsoft for pumping out shit that's defective out of the box. #strugglife
19% battery on my phone apparently means "about to randomly shut off"
Matty Ice just got melted with a blowtorch
If the Canes trade Justin Peters, Jim Rutherford should be examined for a head injury.
Justin Bieber "probably gonna quit music."  Gotta make music first bro.
@CoreyDaElrod #takewhatyoucanget

@EmLizYo OBX lyfe chick
@EmLizYo well actually...
I doubt if I got fired from my job because I used a homophobic slur in front of a customer people would be up in arms about my "free speech"
So many people talk about free speech without knowing what it is.  smh...
Man Tony Romo was our twelfth man on defense tonight.
It's always the fundies smh...
Congrats to @JeffSkinner on his first career hat trick!  Glad he's back. #canes
Justin Peters ---&gt; GET THAT GUY A MEDAL
I mean if their relationship was somehow based on the dudes ability to contact his insurance agent she wasn't wifey material anyways.
That girl from the Geico hail damage commercial is ratchet as fuq.
Jeff Skinner is KILLING it.  #canes
Looks like it's time for the annual, pre-exam "I'm just going to sleep forever" tweet.
So word on the street is that Aaron Rodgers is out for the season if we lose the next game.  Heads will roll.
Damn.  UNCW got hot and we were walking ice cubes.  7 game series and ECU wins 4-1 doe.
Holy shit if I don't get to play for the musical next semester I'm going to murder someone.  These songs sound awesome as fuq.
Holy Jesus
WHAT
Just want Alabama to lose ONE game.
I'm done.  After such a good season we just hand them the east division on a golden platter. #wtf
What the fuck just happened?
Marshall is favored by a field goal?  Good thing we've beaten the odds in 9 of 11 games this year.
@drshow saying violent video games make you a "more efficient killer" is like saying you can play in the NBA from playing basketball games.
I feel like such a badass when I walk past the "cast and crew members only beyond this point" sign.
@EmLizYo don't you dare talk about Cookout with a negative tone.
Justin Peters has a .965 save percentage over the past 4 games. #dayum
@keemrich1 gettin it done!
DAAAMM.  Tampa D!
At the end of the day, no matter what the outcome, NC State struggled against a team we blew out.  #caseclosed
At this point in the game against Carolina we were up 21-3.  Just sayin.
There are people in the NHL drafted in 09 that are younger than me.  What.
That is, if NHL gamecenter gets it's shit together.
Monday Night Football?  No.  It's Monday Night Hockey.
@bellaphanttt I'm always asking myself the same thing.
#capitalonepeedee would be in Pirates in Men's Pants (action version of Pirates of Penzance)
Uhh they were set up in the neutral zone.  Where are the officials?
Lol Cooper used the official as a blocker
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP
Helmets flying errrwhere
This dude just called us the East Carolina Panthers.  Maybe the announcers shouldn't be tailgating too.
AAHHHH WTF that was a lateral pass he dropped.  Way to go officials.
PeeDee's favorite pet, obviously, would be a Parrot #capitalonepeedee
Tough loss Canes.  I'll take the point though.  Let's just play like that 3rd period all the time, K?
Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.
The stories about the Dallas game basically make @D_Harris17 out to be the huge game changer.  That's what you get when you draft out of ECU
Nice to see @D_Harris17 making plays in the NFL.  #ECU
We lost to Tulane, Marshall looks like it's going to lose against FAU, MTU is down to North Texas...  Down is up in CUSA
@thtmusi_k_id it's just insane.  Now we have a loss to the football powerhouse that is the Tulane Green Wave to show for it.
I'll never understand why the coaching staff insists on calling screens when they aren't working.  Saw it last year and this year.
That's what shitty pass protection and play calling gets you.
Are you kidding me.  What the everloving fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?
So glad the stream is going out NOW.
Where'd the D go?
Faq
Backup QB in during overtime.  Good luck tulane
Overtime stresses me out.
TOUCHDOOWWWNNN
Just gotta avoid a turnover and go for the field goal.
Big series for the defense
So THAT'S what an offensive touchdown looks like.
How about some pass protection?  #whatthehell
Ahh.  THERE'S Cooper.
What is Tulanes mascot anyways?  An amorphous green pile of goo?
Surprising absolutely no one, Georgia has choked
The deserted Superdome still has a better atmosphere than Kenan Stadium
Look at all those empty seats in the Superdome... Smh
This is why we can't have nice things.  I guess the 68 people that follow me must have been a valuable spam market.  Congrats everyone

There are google maps reviews for Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.  What
Although I think we all know that Bama will get away with it, because they're gods gift to the world of football.  Obviously.
Ugh Ecu is losing too many key players.  But I guess it's preferable to covering it up and getting sanctions, aka pulling an SEC.
I want the Oakland A's to lose just so O.co will be switched back to a real sport's configuration for the season.
Seeing a baseball diamond on a football field just bums me out.
O.co Coliseum needs to die.
Ray Lewis has been completely murdering his Monday Night Football duties.
Manti Te'o is claiming the hold was actually an elaborate hoax.  There wasn't actually any contact or even a ball on the field.
It's just so hard to take Manti Te'o seriously.
So since the government is shut down, that means speed limits don't exist anymore, right?
In other news, Iowa State seems to be trying the placebo secondary approach.
Iowa State is playing Muse right now at their football game...  I'm officially pulling for Iowa State.
Because fuck doctors.  #ComeOnMan
If a corporation couldn't decide on a budget and was forced to shut down, you'd think the people who were responsible for it would be fired.
The good news, however, is the DHS and NSA continue to monitor all your sexting activities.
I do find it hard not to blame people that kick and scream and refuse to do their job just because they don't like a law, though...
Congrats Congress!  You're inability to do your single most important job has officially fucked us all.  #imdone
Breaking Bad is over... What do I do with my life now?
#PirateNation !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Okay I'm so tired right now that my depth perception has gone to shit.  Time to sleep.
Did I just see @Bootsy_Collins on ESPN at the Bengals game?
Fack Ben Roethlisberger.
It's a little messed up when some members of the marching band get paid more than the players...
Goddayum Oregon...
@CoreyDaElrod 35* #DAMNN
@CoreyDaElrod #youright 28 unanswered points smh...
#cfblive A&amp;M.  They're hungry for this win.
Peedee would be a WR - his quick and nimble skills from his years of pirating would come in handy #CapitalOnePeeDee
I wish I had a ticket oak..
That being said, the 49ers definitely won this game.  They shredded our defense.
I guess the Packers have to get fucked at least once every year by the officials
Lacy's got this running game going.  Play action coming soon.
Defense has got to get it together...
@NoQuarterECU 6 votes for top  25 as well...
Gotta do something about Boldin...
How about Clay Matthews??
Damn the band at Miami gets super shitty seats.
Pretty high percentage of ECU is in black.  I like it.
Ecu defense has got to step it up
Rice bringing their A game.
LolTebow
SMU just made a 51 yard field goal like it was nothing... Damn...
South Carolina's band playing rage against the machine now... #goodstuff
South Carolina's band playing Respect?  I can dig it.
Carolina's offensive line is just getting dominated.
Also, there was "undeniable evidence" of WMDs in Iraq, too.  Maybe we should tread lightly...
The US might be getting ready to invade Syria because of their use of chemical weapons, but let's talk about Miley Cyrus' twerking instead.
@lori_bullock I miss the whole Duck <DOUGHNUT> crew <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
You've got White House correspondents on your show and you're talking about what Miley Cyrus (who's 20 years old, btw) did last night?
People talking about the VMAs when there was a new Breaking Bad tonight smh....
What kind of name is Golden, anyways?
Nobody's actually looking at you.  They're too busy looking at themselves.
It's weird seeing Mennonites use their credit cards in Walmart sporting Nikes....
Ben Roethlisberger throwin' picks.... smh
@travis_phlhrmnc Sivart*
I swear to Dog.
ECU is playing Duke and State this year?  How many postseason wins did those teams have last year?  #caseclosed

It shouldn't take two months to put up an ATM.
I feel like if Ted Nugent is a board member of your organization, regardless of what it is, you seriously need to re-evaluate your goals.
Damn Walt Whitman must really be a good lawyer.
Called it
@thtmusi_k_id C to start out.  Only 104-112 at tempo too.  Not too bad really.
@thtmusi_k_id I look at the thing and the first thing I see is 64th notes.  <SKULL><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Saxophone audition materials in my inbox... The end of summer is officially in view.
Am I really hearing fireworks at 1:40 in the afternoon?
@RealJTP totally missed the point.  Well done sir.
I'm buying Bootsy Collins sunglasses.
I bet @DwightHoward feels like a fucking king right now.  I bet he's already made his decision, too.
You can't fully appreciate brakes until they stop working on you when you're driving
Fight the brainwashing.  I know you can do it.

If (literally) anyone wants to come to Duck Donuts (in Duck) that would be swell.  I'll give you the (patent pending) Trix donut.

@espn has ECU at number 10 of the new 12-team American Conference for Football.  Heh. ooookay espn.  Whatever you say.
Absolutely brilliant move by Xbox.  They've probably regained my business today.
If it were me I'd be terrified to face Miami in a game 7.
Bosh turned up to the max in these last minutes.
Heat
There's a college ball atmosphere in Miami right now.  They've got this.
Holy jesus this game is too much.
BOOM
That's right Danny Green.  God is most definitely rooting for your team of millionaires while people are starving all over the world.
I'd still be nervous if I were a Spurs fan.
Credit to the Spurs, but there's some sketchy officiating going on.
Come on refs.  I could see that with even the shitty watchespn quality.
Woah wait this is a 9 point game
That Allstate commercial with the kid screaming at the top of her lungs makes me feel like I have a knife in my ear.
I just tried to type a tweet into the address bar.  Struggle.
@bellaphanttt I laugh harder literally every time I see it, wtf is wrong with me.
I've become too obsessed with this Jack Sparrow song.
Michael Bolton were really gonna need you to focus up!  Roger that, let me try it with another film!
@bellaphanttt dafuq I never said u need Reece's unless u satan.
@bellaphanttt WHAT?  Satan has a sad life then.  Homie's gotta get some Reeces pieces or something.
@bellaphanttt a staple of my diet for the past three weeks. 
The fuck.  I really thought Gene Wilder was dead.  My life just changed.
Hoping for the big upset...
Ecu Hoops is moving up in the world.  
Why does Anchorman 2 have to be released around Christmas?  I WANT IT NOW OK
Sorry I'm late, I just got caught up watching the Pirates of the Caribbean marathon.  Have you guys seen those things?
The things people post on FB sometimes make me want to choke on a spoon and die.
Back, that is.
Gimme dat home court advantage.
HEY HEY LBJ!  HOW MANY SPURS DID YOU BEAT TODAY?
Wade is finally turned on.  The Heat winning this series depends on him and LBJ staying that way.
Ironically, I kind of wish the premise of the purge was real so I could hunt down the guy who wrote the movie in the first place.
Ah shit we're going to war again.
But then I realize they're just idiots and get on with my life.
People that actually have a chance at having real power post the dumbest, most un-inclusive shit on Facebook sometimes.
@jbstock grammar?  Idk idgaf
If there was a Mexican place that delivers they would make millions.
"Wait, you guys actually think anyone would put all of this stupid shit into one console, charge people more, and make it harder to use?"
I swear to god I think Microsoft is just playing a huge prank on us.  Sometime around August they're going to let us in on it.
Okay so XboxOne just went from shooting themselves in the foot to shredding it with a mini-gun.
Every now and then I remember that Leslie Nielsen is dead and it really bums me out.
Why does McDonald's need ads for this game?  Is there anyone in the world that isn't aware of their existence?
I think I need to go to sleep.
The Christian mingle commercial makes me cringle!  HAHAHAHA wut
That game was physically painful to watch.
Shit you know it's bad when the commentators are talking about Tim Tebow during an NBA game.
If the whole nba thing doesn't work out Blake Griffin could have a decent career as a comedy actor.
3s on 3s on 3s on 3s
This game is the perfect storm.  Miami's off their game and San Antonio has burst into flames.  Too bad it's best of 7.
Maybe I should start a website called 
The Christian mingle commercial makes me cringe.
DUH!!

I wonder what I should tweet for tweet number 900?  Oh shit.
I'm so glad that my bank feels the need to keep my money in posted balance for 36 hours after I deposit it.  It's not like I want to use it.
This is way more freshness than anyone expected. New Old Spice Bar Soap, never leave your house again.
This is not good, because he‚Äôs probably ruining, that persons body who he‚Äôs operating on.
It‚Äôs literally following you everywhere, this could actually be a fairly serious problem.
You‚Äôve got to wash your body the manly way, and the freshness will follow you all through your day.
It's hard for me to take these inspirational Tim Tebow quotes seriously now, considering his career is over.

By all means I would love to hear about the newest weight loss techniques via Facebook
If the Heat avoid a 3rd quarter like the one in the last game this ones in the bag.
Archer is the most hilarious thing since sliced bread.  (I'm aware that doesn't make sense)

Can I gain the ability to read minds now or..?
@bellaphanttt r u srs? 
Seriously like what the hell?  People get weird.
Good lord some people change after high school.  Christ.
Also I hate the world btw.
They look like they're propped up but then a ball rolls over them and my conception of reality is altered.
There are these weird 3D ads on the sidelines of this soccer game right now that are messing with my head.
Happier than Gallagher at a farmer's market.
@bellaphanttt I'm hilarious 24/7.  Even when I'm sleeping.
People that have their settings on private but still favorite tweets I'm mentioned in - WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?
I'm such a rebel 
@bellaphanttt don't h8 on my Scottish/German genes.  #foreverburnt
I think I'm about to literally, figuratively die.
Apparently Australia is the happiest country on the planet.  I guess that means that humanity is done then.
Jesus it's like 80 in my room right now.
Me and the English language just don't get along.
Now that's happy.
Jimmy, how happy are people that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance by switching to Gieco?  Happier than Dracula at a blood drive.
Am I really listening to a Bootsy Collins, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg collaboration song right now? How was I not aware of this?
Why is you're and your so confusing to people?
My life. 
What kind of idiot tries to rob the Sheetz on 10th.  AKA where the cops hang out at night and right next to the police station. #moron
"YOU KILLED CHRISTMAS."  "No your son's acting killed Christmas"
Oh no I didn't repost that thing about the Oklahoma tornado victims I guess I want them to die now.
Television is the most relevant screen in the home?  UH...
I don't care about these random games?  Talk more about the actual product.
For the love of god, is there going to be "always connected" requirement or not?
Aww look how cute EA thinks it is by thinking they can make an NBA game.  
Leave it to 2K, they're better than you.
Fack EA sports.
This asshole is from EA sports?  Let me come up there and punch you in the face for NCAA 12/13
I can already see the millions of people complaining on the internet about how the new Kinect does stuff they don't want it to.
The power behind the next Kinect is that it works without you wanting to rip out your hair and set it on fire. #Xboxreveal
I think it's funny how all these tech companies totally rip off Apple's key note style
Also they should bring back Netflix parties.  If they can stream live TV on this thing they can do that.
Also if they don't address the whole always connected to the internet rumor, heads are going to roll.
With all these"amazing things" that are being shown in the #xboxreveal, is it going to have old technology like backwards compatibility?
I swear the only two possible temperatures in my room are either 50 degrees or 90 degrees.
Bands should know better than to release songs right now when I have no money.
@bellaphanttt Just some of the local OBX color.
1. Convert all Vatican gold to cash 
2. Use cash to feed poor
3. DUE DATE: June 31, 2013
I should create a Facebook filter that just changes dumb things people post into pictures of cats.
Apparently normal people go to sleep before 3 AM and wake up before noon. Who knew?
The Charlotte Bobcats should relocate to Greenville and then get good.
Apparently it's John Blackstock of Grandin Florida's birthday today.  It's hard to believe I'm already 70.
The world would be such a better place if there were nothing but John Blackstocks in it.
Well so much for staying on a normalish sleeping schedule.
I'm pretty sure @bellaphanttt has favorited at least 50% of all my tweets in the past few weeks.
Not like, "wow, I disagree with your political opinion so I think you're dumb" dumb.  Like just plain stupid dumb.
Wow there are some dumb people in my Facebook news feed.
@thisistheodis It's insane.  There's this game coming out in SEPTEMBER that they're already letting you preorder DLC for.
Damn capitalists.
DLC should be something the devs think of AFTER the game is released, not a planned thing to milk people's money.
@bellaphanttt 
@travis_phlhrmnc @marryalicee literally the very last thing I tweeted to her was asking if she was okay during a hurricane.
Idk this cold medicine makes me tweet a lot.
@bellaphanttt Don't favorite my family's dysfunction.
I sure wish @marryalicee would unblock me
I would have mentioned her in that last tweet BUT SHE FUCKING BLOCKED ME ON TWITTER.
I mean my little sister figured it out around 5th grade.  I mean she's a Blackstock so she has an advantage but still.
Also it blows my mind that people my age still don't know the difference between where were and we're.
My last two tweets were stupid and you should ignore them.
HEAT up.  Typos ruin my life.
Knicks are ice cold.  If they don't hear up soon they're looking at a sweep.  Seriously.  Even I could hit some of these shots. #strugglebus
@travis_phlhrmnc He's also arbitrarily helping some sports teams win their games.
Every time the person in the practice room next to mine plays it I impulsively look at my phone...
Well I just figured out that a concert F on a clarinet is the same pitch as an iPhone vibrating.
The fact that #ChristianMingleUsernames is trending right now is an example of why the internet is the best thing in the history of humanity
Maybe one day people will learn that "lose" is not spelled "loose".
Viruses are such a strange thing if you think about it... they're basically a little bit of fat, protein and DNA just dicking around
When I get rich I'm going to buy an NBA team.  Believe you me.
I swear the Barclays Center is the nicest looking court in the NBA.
Well I learned today that cold medicine makes me really like soft things.
No wonder people are failing this class.
"Prokaryotic cells are located in the cytoplasm, whereas Eukaryotic cells are located in the nucleus" How can anyone think this is right?
If the Celtics pull this one out...
I think the entire Celtics team just burst into flames.
I think I've developed a new type of torture.  Get them sick and then force them to play the saxophone.
The Dikembe Mutombo blocking a shot commercial is the best commercial in the history of commercials.
Lets just extend this Bulls Nets series to 14 games, k?
You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant.
Is it really necessary to shout across the old lobby?  People need to learn the difference between outside and inside voices...
Bin Laden was killed two years ago today.  #dafuq
@EmLizYo it's alright I forgive you.
@EmLizYo wow brilliant tweet 10/10 <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
And that's why.
Okay so this strategy for OKC isn't going to work
So does anyone actually think Miami's not going to get the title?
It's gotten to the point that I want the team that's behind in the series to win so there will be more games
They always sound so good doe...
I might be hearing an argument between professors about some shit that went down in a rehearsal. #ohdamn
Damn bacteria fucking all my shit up smh...
What's that?  it's exam/jury season?  Okay well here's a little sickness for you.
I live fairly free of inner-conflict these days.
You only get one shot.  Don't waste it by not being honest with yourself.
I genuinely feel bad when certain aspects of religion cause people to lie to themselves.  It's unhealthy.
Maybe my mitochondria are on strike.
Why do I feel so shitty right now?

That bass player for Kenny Garrett shredded any self esteem I had on bass.

@RealJTP Gee, I wonder why there's such terrible gridlock in Washington?
@EmLizYo chick.  Tomorrow is the last day of classes.  #getittogether
The world may not be as it seems, but that doesn't mean you should make things up and then support them with confirmation bias.
All these NBA guys with an attitude should just step back and chill. Youre already in the top .01% basketball players in the world. Enjoy it
This Golden State crowd is one you'd normally only find in a college game.
@SpaceX is on top of their game.  Way to out-do @NASA
It started out okay, and then she slowly made me want to staple her mouth shut.
Jesus only dogs could hear those last few notes of the national anthem.
Although Dwight Howard is a dumbass for those two technicals.
I feel so bad for the Lakers... they worked really hard to get to the playoffs and then all the players that got them there get injured.
At least the Bucks fans get to see one more home game.
Celtics just showed the Knicks they're not going to just take a sweep... Instead they'll take a 4-1 loss.
Get out the dustpans, it's sweep day.  #lakers #bucks #celtics
BOOM
This game is insane.
WHISKY TANGO FUCKING FOXTROT.
Kenny Garrett doe...
I'm way deep right now... And hungry.
It's amazing how three little words can completely change your perception of a person.
I'm a cynical person.. But cynics make good scientists.  So yeah.  You're  welcome for advancing humanity.
I'm liking this draft class for the Packers so far.

Happier than Dikembe Mutombo blockin a shot.
Jimmy, how happy are folks that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance by switching to Geico?
Metta World Peace &lt;---- way too real.
Okay so next time Brother Ross is on campus everyone with an iPhone should get the laugh track app and play it accordingly.
Idk if you don't like the Mars Volta at least A LITTLE BIT we can't be friends.
I was thinking of running for president of the Awkward People's Union, but I'm too good of a public speaker.
The Mars Volta.
@bellaphanttt you just can't help but creep on the Blackstocks, can you?
It looks like the canes finally got it together.  Better late than never. Just kidding. If you don't make the POs its just as bad as never.
@ball4ny the fact that you are in a position of power in this country terrifies me. You are an immoral person and I pity the people of NY.
I learned some interesting things today... and lost a little respect for someone (not that I really had much to begin with) /negativetweet
I don't know if I can handle the crunchiness that is Meshuggah #shreducation
I wonder how many people would post certain things on Facebook if not a single person liked it or gave them attention?
Hahaha people that want to require drug tests for welfare. Here's a more productive place to put the state's money. 
The energy level I have right now is under -9000
Damn damn.

I'm silently mocking the shit out of people right now.

@travis_phlhrmnc 90% sure, that is.
@travis_phlhrmnc I'm around 90% I'm incapable of offending you.  Congratulations.
I think of the funniest shit I want to post to twitter but it would offend the shit out of my 60 followers (and certain creeper people.)
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot
I think I have a problem with this show.
Gurl I'd watch the shit out of Penn and Teller with you.
NHL:  19:01 -  2ND PER - HURRICANES 3 LIGHTNING 0 via @ScoreCenter wut 
It's also disturbing that there are people that have been on death row that were later exonerated.
If your not personally willing to stick the needle in the guy or switch on the electric chair, you shouldn't ask the government to do it.
We're talking about KILLING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
It's such a medieval concept of a government executing one of its citizens.
I wish @The_Good_Lord would follow me back.
The organist that started out the national anthem at the Red Sox games was hella struggling.
I don't understand why they won't read the guy his Miranda rights. Either way he's getting convicted, might as well treat him like a human.
Also I think all these Taco Bell commercials during the game are getting into my head.
The Cree LED lightbulb commercials make me laugh way too much.
I guess not "strange" exactly.  More just ironic.
I think it's a bit strange that they're fighting to save this kid's life when they've already said they'll push for the death penalty.
Why doesn't Taco Bell deliver?
If State Farm doesn't give me a bunch of free shit when I file a claim I'm going to sue the hell out of them for false advertising.
This bulb lasts 25 times longer.  Nostalgia............... Is dumb.

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is why we can't have nice things.
Yoooooooooooooo
Bro.  Answer your goddamn phone.
Okay phone.  Please arbitrarily refuse to send iMessages in a building that seemingly is cased in lead in regards to cell phone signals.
Oh
@glennbeck No.  Stop making me agree with you.
@travis_phlhrmnc they make a LOT of good points but still manage to be funny.  I'm probably going to be Penn Jillette when I grow up.
@travis_phlhrmnc bullshit.
Also the "97% of my friends will not re-post this" crap is the worst example of armchair activism.
Oh my god some of the people they make fun of on Penn and Teller make me want to bang my head against the wall.  #whoneedscommonsense
Even a small amount of bullshit is still bullshit.
I don't trust people that don't use profanity.  Or people in Bow Ties.
At first I thought this was a big thing, but then I noticed that A Cooper wasn't wearing his tight black t-shirt, so I guess it's okay.
This guy has a shocking resemblance to the second suspect from the Boston bombings.  #holyshit #watertown
I love the internet.
Accidentally didn't lock my phone and ended up randomly liking someone's status on Facebook <SKULL><PISTOL>
When I grow up I want to be Steve Nash.
Ok so it'd be nice if people actually knew what "genetically modified" foods actually are and didn't run away from them in terror.
I seriously laughed at this for 2 minutes 
Listening to the non-music majors bitch about theory &gt;&gt;&gt;
Ok so this ricin letter guy is a moron.  You have to ingest the poison for it to hurt you...  When was the last time you ate your mail?
So many things are messed up in this world...  Might as well take Bobby McFerrin's advice and just be happy (and don't worry.)
I think Miami might make it into the playoffs this year.  lololololol
Not sure why this is so fascinating to me.
The human mind is capable of believing some really crazy things.
Like they REALLY believe it.  It's really sad they never even get the chance to live in the real world.
Over 24 million people believe some really crazy shit about Kim Il Sung.  And they have absolutely no idea how crazy it is.
The North Koreans, that is.
It legitimately makes me sad that people can live completely unaware that they've been brainwashed.
Apparently the North Korean people are allowed food and education by the grace of the Leader.  #creepy
Oh my god...  Now they're playing a slideshow of pictures of Kim Jong Il with smooth jazz in the background.
Its like a cult centered around the leaders.
Okay so North Korean TV is the creepiest thing on the planet.
@thisistheodis dude I just finished Infinite, crazy shit towards the end.
@thisistheodis probably not too many, but you can be sure as shit he's going to be blamed for not stopping it.
Ahhhaha dude.  Come on
Apparently we all get cancer every day but our body naturally fights it off 99.9% of the time.  That's some scary shit.
Just replacing one dumb thing with another.  Smh...
Photons have mass?  I didn't even know they were Catholic.
It genuinely makes me sad that people live in their own little worlds sometimes.
When I grow up I want to be Bob Ross.
I'm so tired that I might literally, figuratively die.
I'm on a huge Mars Volta kick right now.
Some things people put on Facebook make me want to pull out my hair and set it on fire.
Wow that's pretty dumb and you should feel bad for saying it.
Like people that I've literally never talked to will be the main subject.
I have dreams about the most random people sometimes. <SLEEPING FACE>
The bubble some people live in... smh
Some people sometimes...
It blows me away that all these people at this school are going to be in the workforce in at most 4 years #smh
If we don't play start wearing purple next year I'm going to literally die.
Okay so I need dat pep band money stat.
It's funny, I don't remember my car being a yellowish green...
I would bet 50$ this guy wouldn't learn Italian if he went to Italy.
"I refuse to learn Spanish because I'm American and I shouldn't have to because you came over the border" - guy on the bus #smh
@SenatorBurr glad you're approaching this with a non-partisan attitude.  That's the best way to get this country on track.
Its crazy that some stars are so far away that if you see them explode on earth it could have happened millions of years ago #randomstarshit
<CLOCK FACE TWO-THIRTY><SLEEPING FACE>
Generally the ones that go out of their way to say that they're good people, aren't.
Oh yeah our unemployment growth is slowing and stuff.  Also North Korea might nuke us, no biggie.
I feel you bro
Ok so I keep seeing that North Korea is saying that they're getting ready to launch a missile... I feel like we should be more concerned...
Ugh why do the Canes even try anymore?  Lets get the backups some experience for next year...
@DanielRobinson5 we'll have to cover it when we start our band.
Dat bass solo at the beginning of Day of the Baphomets doe.
97.6 percentile bracket. That is all.
This makes it 12 losses out of the last 13 games.  #thestruggleisrealonice
I know more about global warming than 99% of scientists because I watch Fox News guys.
5-0 in the middle of the second period... smh...
Ok just because it's warm outside doesn't mean the buses have to be 40 degrees.
It's sort of funny how the Big East is dominating the tournament the last year before it gets FUBAR.
Mark Pryor is an idiot.
The two beeps on the construction equipment outside Minges are creating a minor second.  #musicmajorproblems
@travis_phlhrmnc fantastic.
Rick Pitino always looks likes he's about to break into tears.
Well don't feel bad.  It's hard as hell to beat a team 4 times.
Why do Vikings and Romans always have English accents in today's media?  That's not even close to how they would have sounded...
I think I'm going to literally die when March Madness is over.
Seriously, whoever thought that would be a good idea should be fired.
The court in this Louisville vs Cal game makes it look like Exxon is a corporate sponsor.
How crazy would it be if Louisville won both the men's and women's tournament?
Doug Wilson might be one of the best characters on TV.  Sterling Archer still takes the cake at No. 1, but it's close.
Anyways the Lakers still have no valid excuse for not dominating this year with that kind of talent.  smh
Well technically everything humans do is biology, but still.
Just biology, I guess.
You sure as shit learn something new every day.
Maybe I should be a psychologist so I can understand how the human mind works.
Cognitive dissonance.  It amazes me how much of it people can live with.
guh
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooope.
We beat Evansville, who beat Wichita State, who beat  #1 Gonzaga.  So by the transitive property ECU is the best team in the country.
It's so sad when I see people that chronically lie to themselves.
Are you kidding me?  He might has well have punched Carter Williams
@jbstock2 must run in the family
Come on Canes... Pull it together.  Not just this game.  I'm talking the whole season.
Now Weber State.  Watch how Louisville actually hits their free throws at the end of the game.  You could learn a thing or two.
One of the bands at the final four are using constant cowbell.  It almost makes me forgive the struggling trumpets.
And my scorecenter app just told me that Wichita and Louisville are tied at 60 with 3:08 to play.  #waytobeontheball
Even if Wichita State loses this one, they've still shocked me (huehuehuehuehue) with how well they've played.
I'm in a cynical type of mood today.
The things people post on Facebook...  Stop being so dramatic.
People that support drug testing for welfare....  Just do you research, is all I can say.
I have become one with the insomnia
@taylorc54 maybe he has a sick 7 year old daughter.  #checkyourprivilege
I smell cake.
People that are antigay just need to stop.  Like everything.
Ok I was joking but I seriously think I'm going to make stir fry next year on Good Friday.  #goodstirfriday
Seriously doe, baseball needs a salary cap.
CarMANjello!  SAY IT!
American athletic conference just screams mid major.  #ecutotheSEC #lol
LOLWAT
