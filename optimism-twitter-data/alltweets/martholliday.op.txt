@insidewrite1957 Peter, can you DM me your email address - I'm pursuing something with our local youth football league - need some advice.
What a shame the really important RESPECT guide for parents on the @FA website requires a FAN account! Parent engagement is hard enough!
@AmbivalentJon I'm happy to trust in his judgement, not so optimistic SM will support him fully. Watch this space.
@AmbivalentJon it'll be an interesting preseason, not least where Steve Morgan is concerned. KJ now needs to be backed.
In short, Sako has been an absolute joy to watch and I doubt we'll be able to replace that talent. But good luck to him. #wwfc
'flair' player I have ever seen at the Mol. I never wanted to see him defending. And mistakes when trying something brilliant? ok by me 2/2
I have seen one or two criticising Sako's defensive game. And the fact he could make mistakes. Sako is arguably the best attacking 1/2
Sako's always been a bit unpredictable, he'll probably end up at MK Dons. #wwfc
@goldandblackwiz @wolvesmatchworn they didn't want Sam Allardyce but they got him!! Can't see KJ going anywhere though.
And what a semi final tie - Norwich v Ipswich!!! Pitch fork frenzy!
7th place is a remarkable achievement for a club that was on its knees two seasons ago. Kenny Jackett has done a brilliant job. #wwfc

@Richwolves64 it's all about next season for me. And I'm expecting KJ to be backed - if it doesn't happen questions must be asked of SM.
@Richwolves64 KJ has worked miracles, but can only get so far. Morgan's spending will be rightly scrutinized and judged in the Summer.
@ContactCounts and there lies another problem. Escalation process for welfare issues is ambiguous. Lack of feedback too.
@ContactCounts Hope it was reported to CWO and got escalated to League &amp; CFA. That coach should be stopped from working with children ASAP.

How many people will be pressurised into exercising their 'democratic right to vote' and end up voting for somebody they don't believe in?

Love how MP's don the same 'sleeves rolled up &amp; tie tucked' look for NHS site visits. Dirty Politicians - infection control nightmare.

@derrickayers17 you too
@derrickayers17 lol, try dishing them out to the parents... At least it might keep them quiet for a while
@derrickayers17 which I can understand given some of the idiots on the touchline these days.
@derrickayers17 ideally both teams would have had a team welfare officer there to nip it in the bud, but its not a role many parents want.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach anyway, hope all was ok afterwards. All the best.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach was just picking up on that point though mate, re failing to control spectators. Can't judge refs on that.
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 abandoning game. Under no circumstances is it the refs duty to wade in there himself. That would be madness.
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 if the opposing coach failed to address it then the ref should have spoken to both teams coaches with a view to
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 if the opposing parents were the issue then the ref should have asked opposing coach the deal with it.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach lads, referees should not be intervening directly with supporters! Please check out laws and respect code conduct
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach neither does the ref though. Potentially even more dangerous as he/she has no protection at all.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach depressingly familiar scenes up and down the country though.
@derrickayers17 lol, i still disagree! Think how dangerous that could be for a referee!
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach but if one of issues was failing to control parents then the team officials should look at themselves.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach yes particularly on twitter - not easy
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach lol we've gone round in circles here. In short, spectator behaviour is NOT for referee to address directly.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach if the ref is getting abuse then he should ask the team officials to address it, then if ness report / abandon it
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 no, that is your argument
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach would you advovate that a 14yr old referee intervenes with adults who on the sideline directly?
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 why not? Suggest you read the FA respect code of conduct, or read laws of the game.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach do you see referees intervening with crowd trouble at pro games?
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach no, the opponents coach should.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach @CoachingFamily if there is not a cwo or two there then the coach should intervene.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach @CoachingFamily sorry mate, I disagree. The club / team are responsible for the spectators.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach @CoachingFamily sometimes, unfortunately not. But that is not the referee's responsibility mate.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach @CoachingFamily Everyone! Primarily club / team welfare officer, coaches, manager.
@cbabcoach @derrickayers17 @CoachingFamily not buying that - parents should behave, end of.
@derrickayers17 @cbabcoach @CoachingFamily it is not the referee's responsibilty to keep control of the parents!

@ContactCounts they have the org influence to challenge and make positive changes, a bit like Lancs. be interested to see their response.
The current grassroots youth football structure is crippling the development of English footballers. See my last RT for insight.
@ContactCounts another brilliant piece. Well done. I wish the County FA would listen. Have you contacted @BirminghamFA ?


Wish people would keep their political persuasion between them and the polling booth.
@markproskills @ContactCounts @Broady94 and ultimately that comes at all costs. Many parents fail to see the bigger picture.
@markproskills @ContactCounts @Broady94 trouble is too many coaches pander to the pressure put on them by parents to get results.

@robcf1979 @ContactCounts @RealMicParish @savegrassroots @Tad690 agree which is why it needs a rethink by the FA. Lvl1 isn't working.
@robcf1979 @RealMicParish @ContactCounts @savegrassroots @Tad690 imho L1 does nothing to prepare someone for realities of coaching children
@robcf1979 @RealMicParish @ContactCounts @savegrassroots @Tad690 youth module should be the pre-req, not lvl1.
@robcf1979 @RealMicParish @ContactCounts @savegrassroots @Tad690 imo lvl1 is not a great entry point for those people. No age context.
@robcf1979 @RealMicParish @ContactCounts @savegrassroots @Tad690 and these people have never coached or worked with kids before.
@robcf1979 @RealMicParish @ContactCounts @savegrassroots @Tad690 many gr coaches are volunteers, Dads or moms - Its not a vocation

My contact lens case has one lid with L on and the other has nothing on. This assumption annoys me.
But offloading RJ and Clarke is as good as a new signing #wwfc
Transfer windows at #wwfc are like those annoying 5th floor hotel windows that you can only open an inch.
No #wwfc business expected, but I'm still refreshing my twitter feed 35 times per minute. #blind #hope
@worvo86 ha! Thats the south bank - they rebuilt the entire wolverhampton landscape behind it
I know it's crass, I know it's vile, I know it's often a shambles and I know it's completely mental but I do love #TDD #TransferDeadineDay

He must have grabbed flight over after last night's match! #WWFC #TransferWatch 
@adampardon suggest you check your sources mate, this is what I saw #wwfc 
The Jarvis rumours (his car seen at Compton Park today) are rubbish. He was actually giving this bloke a lift. 
@Stefan90wolves i know, its the only blue sky I could find <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

I'm not a fan of Boris Johnson generally, but he's nailed the whole Islam thing here imo 
@YasinAdam0 @liamwalker2003 is that Twayne Loony?
@MalcmacX he's not reliant on NHS though

Meeting at St Georges Park today, QPR team bus turned up during our stampede to lunch. Karl Henry bumbled out of the way by hungry riffraff.
2-3cm of snow... 
@measlewolf @CSpillard E&amp;S have a lot to answer for, historically, imo (where club PR and club/supporter relations are concerned).
@CSpillard some people don't even read the article and react purely to the rather inflammatory headline.

We've reached the thundersnow to snow transition stage at Manchester Airport, panic over.
2-3cm of snowfall is now being branded by the media as 'Thundersnow'.
@TheWolvesForum Must be a bid in for him. Moxey's asked him to wear it.
McManaman is a good signing for #wba - He fired my Bristol City side to the 2018/2019 Prem title in FM. 26 goals from an outside fwd role!
@powell_ian i always look for my Grandad in this Powelly

@AnnoDomini79 i think @Vancliffe_Dean is trying to sell us a handbag.
Has a fight between players in an English football match ever progressed from initial handbag stage?
@PatRussell96 @toddo08 i think he might have advised me given my unexpected tax bill
@toddo08 but we've got some gems coming through the ranks. How much might Iorfa have set us back?
@PatRussell96 nobody likes a small player with a beard Pat. #gnomephobes
@PatRussell96 @toddo08 I heard he's working at Inland Revenue now offering advice on tax returns.
@PatRussell96 @toddo08 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> whatever happened to Thomas Doyle?
@toddo08  no more big bang 'marquee' signings anymore. Lets face it, that never really worked for us in the end.
@toddo08 they're looking for one more, but we have to resign ourselves to the fact this is the way Wolves operate now. Softly softly.
@ByronCoach @coachingbadges that said, they'd probably be late to parents meeting <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@ByronCoach @coachingbadges parents meeting - state expectations listen to issues with times. May be something daft and easily addressed
@ByronCoach @coachingbadges perhaps state an arrival time 15mins before start of training?
@ByronCoach @coachingbadges difficult one as child is not in control of getting there on time- any punishment would affect the child.
@iIllumiinati is that Rio Ferdinand on the right?
Yorkshire RFU are giving every junior club 2 hi-visibility vests to support #SilentSundays 
According to Celtic fans, Sundays meeting with Rangers will be the first time the two clubs have met. 
Got out the car at the park today and heard what sounded like an adult game on nearby pitch. As we rounded corner we saw it was an U7 game.
@ContactCounts @LancashireFA me too- have a good morning
@ContactCounts @LancashireFA me too which is why I ended up writing the world's longest blog on the subject <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@LancashireFA yes - some surprising and not surprising feedback!!
@ContactCounts @LancashireFA that is a brilliant piece Richard - everything I've been trying to articulate in a nutshell.
@LancashireFA Just found it, and read it. Brilliant. A Proactive approach that should be applied nationally.

I'll say it again to anyone surprised at the replay ticketing arrangements. Cup competitions are incompatible with the #wwfc business model.
@measlewolf aka 'The Madhouse Championships'
@PatRussell96 The Warchest is in the same place that Malaysian Airlines flight went missing.
So Jordan Graham is the signing that Jez Moxey will use to defend our January transfer business. And he has the Kortney Hause card waiting.
I'm not sure what's going on in this photo but it adds a rather sinister twist to the story (Sky News) 
@Lizzymcbusy i'll have a look

@WolfieWestbrom @MalcmacX Rudgie would make a good DoF at the Baggies imo. Flat cap parade through Smethwick!
@MalcmacX exactly. What he does is effective even if it is somewhat of a turn to the 'dark side' for the longstanding 'purists'.
@MalcmacX nothing wrong with any of that! It's a bit like Labour trying to save their political future by signing Ken Clarke.

@dan_jeavons agree mate and I hope that starts in January. Until then, we are what we are and have to stick by them.
MAC OUT #wwfc
Reality: Where the club chooses to invest its money is something we have NO CONTROL over. Anger and bed sheets influences nothing.
Reality: Yes there has been a lack of investment in this team. But what is the Club's aspiration? Consolidation? Or promotion?
Reality: Wolves are a good league one team battling away in what is a much tougher division. We have KJ to thank for the points we have got.
This is made for

Some people demanding the #warchest but where is it going to play? 
There is some absolute shite being thumped into Twitter this evening #wwfc #meltdown
The trouble with grassroots junior football is there are far too many thick adults involved.
@CoachingFamily or grassroots linesmen who coach from sideline ('Get out! get out! offside ref!!!!!')
@CoachingFamily or grassroots linesmen who simply don't know the rules (dads flagging offside before ball has even been played)
@CoachingFamily can anything be done about grassroots linesmen (Dads who tend to flag for offside when his Son's team looks like conceding)?
@PatRussell96 I suspect this may be the case

The image I have when THE WARCHEST is mentioned is Steve Morgan sitting on top of an old pirate chest full of jewels and gold coins. #wwfc

@kysoccerdoc @Tad690 no problem. We've found kids can only truly express themselves when they feel comfortable, safe and happy.
@kysoccerdoc @Tad690 which includes emotional security and being empathetic to their issues, problems and needs.
@kysoccerdoc @Tad690 being able to train, learn and develop and express themselves in a safe environment.
@Tad690 they want guidance and security. And the occasional moment of hilarity.
@Pitchero disgusting pricing plan for grassroots football clubs. I hope, like us, clubs move to one of the many other free providers.
There's respectful caution and there's giving a team far too much respect. Once we realised they had no threat, it was too late. #wwfc
@1sttouchfa @markproskills @DavidRMckechnie of course. But in my own experience none of them have.
@1sttouchfa @markproskills @DavidRMckechnie agree!

@markproskills @1sttouchfa @DavidRMckechnie i appreciate frienships change over time. But give them a chance to play at least a few yrs
@markproskills @1sttouchfa @DavidRMckechnie when its all about fun and playing with the mates you grew up with.

@RealADGoldberg reality is most clubs now think the cup is not a 'business critical' competition.
@RealADGoldberg its not just #wba - most clubs adopt this policy. #wwfc approach was to shut half ground and field a 2nd string.

@Tad690 thought it was an effective approach rightly or wrongly because they are familiar with such terms as DR, DMC, MC from the game! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@Tad690 Our opponents coach on Sunday was using Fifa2014 terms to explain positions to his lads on Sunday. They instantly recognized roles.
@msluckycat @markproskills <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> seen one like that you've seen them all.
@msluckycat @markproskills he will probably 'instruct' them to 'make better decisions' and expect immediate improvement.
@msluckycat @markproskills that sounds like a coach who blames his players for his own failings.

@insidewrite1957 we are U11's mate, read back <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@insidewrite1957 they're just going by the FA guidelines.
@insidewrite1957 @Tad690 I think on that we both agree! The point was - the competitive rules incite, in some, winning over development.
@insidewrite1957 @Tad690 so we narrowly missed out on those competitive rule changes
@insidewrite1957 @Tad690 we're u11s mate
@insidewrite1957 @Tad690 this is from FA U11/U12 Their Game guidelines 
@DavidCockings @Tad690 I agree in part, but the fact is that for many coaches and parents the results DO matter.
@insidewrite1957 @Tad690 we are the last year group caught up in the competitive rules. Next years u11 will be non competitive.
@kysoccerdoc @PenicuikAthYFC @Tad690 indeed. It is truly depressing.
@PenicuikAthYFC @Tad690 sometimes I wonder if it's just me!
@Tad690 Acceptable motivational cry? Or unnecessarily OTT for 10 year olds playing football?
@Tad690 'so our first game is at home so let's send a message to the rest of the league we are here to win this all the way........'
@Tad690 'we have 2new faces to this season and they bring the will to win games.... '
@Tad690 found the following rallying call on an U11 team page... The epitomy of youth football in this country.....
Sweet dreams everyone 
Roy Hodgson is the epitomy of what the National game has become. Tired, old and risk-averse. The establishment and fear rules our game.

Sky Sports reporters literally bollocking through their reports as quickly as possible before someone can shove a dildo in their ear.
Sky Sports coverage of Transfer Deadline Day is grotesque. But the large gatherings of fans humiliating their reporters feels like revenge.

@rossmacnamara4 @Tad690 Notes are one thing. It's the leather-bound dossier that I'm intrigued by. He looks like a double glazing salesman.
There's all the obvious Robin Williams films. And then there's One Hour Photo. The best of them all. 
@Tad690 maybe pouring over a dossier of notes in a folder during a game is the answer?
@TheWolvesForum it's the only credible theory
@TheWolvesForum Is he dead?
Roy Hodgson is so tediously risk averse that if he became a woman he would probably still wear the same suit and call himself Roy Hodgson.
@SkySportsNewsHQ for who?
We must ensure sporting retention…
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 instead choosing to only pick the strongest players &amp; let the time consuming 'weaker ones' slip away.
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 yes they do. I've seen many kids fall out of the game because coaches will not invest time in them
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 yes, but only if you as coach have that willingness to learn. Some dads go into 'knowing it all'.
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 lot to answer for.
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 agreed. In my opinion this lack of coaching framework for all volunteer coaches at kids level has a
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 most 'dad' volunteers aren't adequately prepared for coaching kids after the level one course.
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 and better access to level two and beyond, including funding/sponsorship is needed.
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 and most grassroots managers only get to do level one as a minimum. More age appropriate contentneeded
@gazwogga @coachingbadges @AllySlug93 FA Level one provides only organisational awareness. There is no coaching framework as such.
@TimNash_star if you were a journalist of any repute, you'd have bugged his can of slimfast.
@toddo08 bloody atheist
TRY THIS: Stare at Warnock's eyebrows for 1min then close your eyes. You will see a vision of Jesus holding an eel. 
@Tad690 .... measure of success.
@Tad690 success is also seeing development, no matter how subtle it is. We'll never be about trophies and glory. That is some other coach's
@Tad690 success for me is retaining players even after a season of poor results. Happy kids who want to carry on playing and developing.
@Tad690 agreed! But what does success mean in this case? I read so many stories about coaches who 'win things'. Less about those who don't.
Credit to any club choosing to progress in the cups by using a full strength team. No sympathy at all for those who don't and fail.

#vanGaal 
That wasn't a shock. MK Dons are a well organised team, determined to progress in the cup with a full strength team. Man Utd are not.
A day and night of pure carnage, summed up in this one memorable photo.

@MalcmacX fkn Gaza!!?
The Gazza story is tragic but only because of the sheer volume of charitable and well wishing people he's let down and shit on.
How is it that some folks can spend literally 10 minutes at a cashpoint, treating every press of a button like its a miracle of science.
@MalcmacX if that's true then it is an outrage! Bricks for Wolverhampton, top albeit mentally unstable footballing talent for Liverpool.

@powell_ian @toddo08 @LeeWwfc1877 until they start negotiating on fees and wages they will never know.
@powell_ian @toddo08 @LeeWwfc1877 a difficult one- theyre essentially drawing up a shopping list with no idea of eventual costs.
@powell_ian @toddo08 @LeeWwfc1877 having targets is one thing but the negotiations is another. Every club has a Moxey driving a hard bargain
@toddo08 @powell_ian @LeeWwfc1877 put your faith in whoever plays and support the team regardless for that we CAN influence.
@toddo08 @powell_ian @LeeWwfc1877 and as we've seen before restless fans causes nerves on the pitch causes implosion.
@toddo08 @powell_ian @LeeWwfc1877 there is nothing we can do about whatever the budget is. We can moan but it won't help. It is what it is.
@toddo08 @powell_ian @LeeWwfc1877 whether you like it or not its all about budget budget budget and we will never know what the budget is.
@TheWolvesForum the good rumours are never true
@bradwilko1 what about a chamakh 
@CSpillard @wolvesmatchworn he must be pissed up
@JasonWhiting5 don't get me wrong I'd hate us to panic buy! Much prefer the considered approach- its just a bit unexciting in short term.
The strange feeling of emptiness you get when your club states 'There will be no panic buying'. #wwfc
If you can't bury your chances you deserve to be punished cheaply.
Check out the solitary Wolves fan celebrating in amongst the Scouse 
@PatRussell96 the sooner it crawls off up its own arse the better.
@Beds72 agree about depth mate, but we also have a tight budget. It's a tough one. It's just where we are as a Club/business at the mo.
Little Computer People 
@Beds72 there are some significant cash  drains at Molineux which have to be addressed before we can invest to the level we all want.
@Beds72 I think the problem is that one season of success raises expectancy and with that it raises perceptions of a 'virtual' budget.
I think some #wwfc fans think Steve Morgan can put the game into 'edit data' mode and add transfer funds when he likes.

@stedonwwfc @stefan90wolves @LeeWwfc1877 I am forever amazed at the lack of tolerance for emerging young players at Wolves.
Jamie O'Hara's association with Wolves is now just a weekly wage transaction. No home, no squad number, no team-mates and no friends. #wwfc

@goldandblackwiz @FA the whole grassroots development ethos is compromised by people like this.
@Tad690 thoughts?
@goldandblackwiz @FA it needs exposing- it is the one key thing that is continually not being addressed.
@FA they will handpick players on physicality over technqiue to bully wins during these formulative years. Its the elephant in the room.
@FA Competive or not, Mini soccer is still littered with single minded coaches favouring results of development 1/2
@FA 'I've coached at a higher level and I know what I'm doing'. Don't question the framework, question the coaches. 2/2
@FA I challenged 2 coaches of junior football teams about their behaviour with their players last season. Their defence (each time): 1/2
@OfficialWolves standard
Like Germany needed something else to feel superior about.
Listening to Clarke Carlisle critique direct free kick technique is akin to Steve Claridge offering advice on defensive positioning.
David Luiz is just a much hairier Paul Stancliffe #wwfc

I don't think Conor Newton realised #rufc hadn't sealed promotion yet.
Highlight of the evening - Simeone snatching his medal off Platini
You just get the sense that ITV are on the verge of some calamitous technical hitch - they're just waiting for a critical moment in the game
@NME poppycock! Vauxhall and I number one?!
@RealBobMortimer peppermint?
@wayneofwolves @didavies_star @ExpressandStar beat me to it wayne <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@IAMBEARDO will les savy fav ever tour uk again Tim?
Breaking distance is a concept sadly lost on many drivers.
SO, let's fill 10 minutes discussing the use of the word 'so' because there's not much news about today @BBCBreakfast #so
What a great game #lofc v #rufc will be. Two great teams, with larger than life managers, playing football the right way.

Sam Allardyce reveals the secrets of his success 
@PTAlanSwann you've had a poor season Alan. Expect a vote of confidence from the editor.
@PatRussell96 enforcing law and order with the power of the dance
@AdamSyntax ha! Sam's looked better hasn't he
What has Big Sam done to his chin? 
@Jon_wwfc cheers jon
@Wayneshakespea1 thanks wayne!
@OldGoldGlory ta mate
@TheWolvesForum cheers boys
@MalcmacX looking forward to it! Get the pink on ice!
@measlewolf cheers kid
@wolvespremier thanks bud
@lebaroudeur you're a walking router!!!
Our u10's team (u11's next season) still on the lookout for new lads wanting to play football - kingswinford / wordsley area. DM for info.
Missing football already #wwfc #kofc
@lebaroudeur do those tops have usb slots?

Super sunda....zzz
@graham_large good lad!
@graham_large yes cheers- you recovered from your little jog / bike ride??
@graham_large it had the staff puzzled!! #enigma
Prob worth trying your new wolves top on before buying - we found 3 shirts labelled 'large' all different dimensions #wwfc
Surprised to hear that @MSwain_star was 1/4 of Bucks Fizz back in the day 
@goldandblackwiz i'm sure they redid the driveway in and stuck floodlights up etc. Though the burger van could do with a deep clean lol
@goldandblackwiz didn't bilbrook get a grant for improvements on that site??
@jon306 shambles
Chris McCann - Mr Charisma #skysports #QPR #wafc
Why don't footballers take their headphones off and pack them away before they get off the coach? #twats
Greg Dyke OUT #fa
Inadequate coaching and lack of coaching frameworks &amp; lack of adequate and affordable facilities. Both will cost millions. 3 pages. 2/2.
Just 3 pages of Greg Dyke's 84 page report is devoted to the 2 key issues crippling grassroots football and youth development...1/2
Does the existing u21 league not serve any useful function? Why should we now insert that into the existing football league structure?
How will making homegrown Premiership youngsters play against Conference teams improve their development? Who will actually benefit?
#gmb a vast array of studio interview locations
Desk for business?
Chairs for politics?
Couch for human interest stories?
#gmb is just #daybreak but with more serious expressions and on screen text.
@SouthBankWolf nope - completely the wrong fit.
@lebaroudeur @nicholasward74 @OfficialWolves i'm with you nick!! But palace have done better than that one. Looked like 2 chefs hats!
Retweet this if you're not gullible.
Retweet this if you're gullible.
Nothing better than seeing a gutted Jamie Carragher having to analyze a disappointing Liverpool performance live on Sky Sports.
LONDONERS! It's spelt UP not AP. #speakproper #cants
@nicholasward74 @OfficialWolves agreed... only something that looks better than this....
@wolvespremier deal!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> - good day mate, well done.
Enjoyed Part 2 of the George Elokobi show today. Someone tells me there was also a testimonial? #wwfc
After that performance by @wolvespremier it won't be long before he's getting a call from Mick McCarthy to lead the Ipswich front line.
#Modernism

George Elokobi still walking around Wolverhampton in his kit, crying and glancing folornly at his medal. #wwfc
More tributes that look like obituaries! Just to reiterate, George Elokobi is not dead. He's just leaving. #goodluckgeorge #stillalive
@studavis <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> take cover mate!!
@TimNash_star @philwakelam i hope so Tim
@philwakelam @TimNash_star the e&amp;s will no doubt spend the summer building up this expectancy
Job done. #pissedit 
@MalcmacX like how kenny's holding it too - one hand supporting the base #safehands
Well done Kenny #wwfc 
Attention West Ham fans - Big Fat Sam is laughing #WHUFC 
@itv #daybreak is dead?! This is fantastic news.
Jez Moxey frequents nudist beaches during the Summer wearing nothing but a NASA cap #wwfc
@johnshuttlewrth my boys love singing along to eggs and gammon although the fate of the daddylonglegs always sends them into pensive mood.
@tom_doyle_wwfc @LDStokesy @matted1979 @StefanCampbell9 @MartinDanks @JOHNCLARKWWFC @WolfInDerby @Robbo_WWFC @Dwarfio #grubbyknighthood
@philwakelam i'm clearly not worthy of such an accolade!
@philwakelam ha!! deepest sympathies my friend #chosen
If you're in one of Tom Doyle's 'top lads' tweets, treat it like a very grubby knighthood <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #thechosenones
Some folks writing tributes to George Elokobi like he's just snuffed it! He's leaving ffs! Thanks, farewell and good luck! #wwfc
@molineuxman1977 @TimNash_star they're only sleeves
If you think black sleeves are controversial just wait till you see the V NECK on the away top #outrage #panic
@TheWolvesForum blimey talk about milking it!!
@TheWolvesForum when will we see the away top?
@Dwarfio just wait... the away shirt will be blue and white stripes with moxey's face in the O of whathouse #allgonewrong
@OfficialWolves Have you ever sounded an alarm so loud that it prompted an entire evacuation of Luxembourg? #askkev
@OfficialWolves I have a very damp and dark border in my garden - any idea what sort of plants/shrubs I can plant there? #askkev
@OfficialWolves what's your favourite colour and why? #askkev
@OfficialWolves have you ever rolled a bogey so big that several cows in herefordshire sat down anticipating rain? #askkev


@TheWolvesForum all the mock ups always look far better than the underwhelming effort we actually get.
'Fat', 'Northern' and 'Cant'. The most widely used words by West Ham supporters during their appraisal of the game yesterday #whufc
@LeamWolves @Richwolves64 don't forget craig gardner!
@MrALStone @OfficialWolves cheers bud
@MrALStone @OfficialWolves when is it released mate?
Martin Atkinson is having a great game. It's like herding a bunch of twats out there. #lfc #cfc
Jose Mourinho looks like a right old bag of shit.
@MrALStone @OfficialWolves @TimNash_star loan bid for Suarez
Any pitch invaders today will be chased off personally by Jez Moxey himself #wwfc
@iIllumiinati that's genius that is #cringe
@jacobjangelo @studavis one for @CuntsWatching surely?
UK Planes chasing Russian planes away from our Isles!
And the only dialogue that comes to mind is 'GERROUTOFIT!'
@BBCNews Nicholas Witchell - still slithering from one tediously trivial Royal outing to another.
Where were you on the day David Moyes was sacked from #mufc? I was in bed, reading twitter and picking my nose.
@goldandblackwiz he's too fast?
Pissed it #wwfc
@YamYamArmyWWFC hi Tom
Wow. 'Liverpool fans' with strong herefordshire accents celebrating a 3-2 win in a small Shobdon based pub, Herefordshire.
One of the most startling things about the great #wwfc pitch invasion furore is the amount of people who believe 'steward' is spelt 'stuard'
@toddo08 embarrassing mate.
Wolves groundsmen filling in the grooves on the pitch this morning caused by dragging knuckles yesterday. #wwfc
@ExpressandStar Rati Junction?
@powell_ian @Beds72 @Dwarfio fair play!!! Unlike that flamin goose steppin horse at cheltenham!
@Beds72 @Dwarfio @ian_powell if it's a German greyhound write it off ffs.
@PTAlanSwann dedicating this tune to you 
@PTAlanSwann is Peterborough's answer to @tom_doyle_wwfc
@teddyrabbiit Attention seeker. Peterborough's answer to Tom Doyle.
@PTAlanSwann What an ignorant &amp; bitter little man #gollum
@RealYamYamBloke arrr mucka
@RealYamYamBloke what yow avin to drink?
aaargh - another @BBCNews Nicholas Witchell royal report before I could find the remote!!! Grease now oozing from the tv speakers.
Nicholas Witchell's ridiculously sycophantic Royal reports for @BBCNews are creating swirling grease clouds over the Pacific.
@toddo08 @PatRussell96 @chrissyJDowner9 @powell_ian @andrewkane3 downer had his eyes on that top mate!
@PatRussell96 @chrissyJDowner9 @powell_ian @andrewkane3 asked toddo too but he's in for his foot op.
@MSwain_star @TimNash_star what does 'heavy trading' mean? Moxey in talks to sign Akinfenwa?
Peter Cech is trying to play mind games with #LFC as the title race hots up. He's should take that fucking ha…
@BBCNews Nicholas Witchell's Royal tour commentary is literally slithering out of my television.
@WolfieWestbrom @MalcmacX Reinforce your door mat! The E&amp;S is coming! 
The woman in the Corsodyl advert is having a mare. Mind you, they say shit comes in threes #bleedingeyes #bleedinggums #losesatooth
@_youhadonejob sky sports app score updater person, you had one job. 
@tom_doyle_wwfc Tom?
@tom_doyle_wwfc have you seen either of them play Tom?
@MalcmacX no, it was just a bit of wind
An amazing thing happened today.
 
Leon Clarke smiled. 

#wwfc
@CraigRickhuss @chrissyJDowner9 only I fetch his scythe #backoff #biatch
Cheers #wwfc
And we somehow managed to do it without the 'Premier League' quality of Jamie O'Hara #wwfc
Well done Kenny Jackett #wwfc 
@TimNash_star to have a look at Sako's headphones?
@bbc is there another news analysis / feedback show where I can complain about the pointlessness of #newswatch ?
@bbc #newswatch A dictatorship organisation offering lip service to customer feedback. #embarrassing
@iIllumiinati how mysterious. And look at all those people on the roadside. What the hell is going on?!
@chrissyJDowner9 @ClassickTom @tom_doyle_wwfc @Matt_Summerz it's a pandemic of stupidity
And then she lost her job
And heaven knows she's Millerable now.
#MariaMiller 
@didavies_star @ExpressandStar hi diane - please keep us posted when the royal baby soils its nappy so we can all fawn over it. #zzz
When working for @BBCNews reporting on the royals don't forget to:

Soften expression
Use tender / gushing language
Fawn over every detail
@robstaton @TimNash_star @audioboo so, just to clarify, he didn't think it was a penalty?
@toddo08 get yer foot sorted fella!! Next season - new adventure!
@toddo08 me too mate - it's been refreshing!! Away for Carlisle game!
@toddo08 i've even got evo up for that game!! Make up for it next season and hope it goes well kid
@LUCYITV is the best weather person in the history of weather persons, ever. Weather doesn't get any more relaxing.

Hughton the latest victim of the Baggies' managerial curse. Because there is no greater disgrace than losing to #wba
@Boothjan Hughton dodged a few at full time
If your strategy is to poach and play all the best players, then please do not have the audacity to call yourself a coach: #grassroots
Regardless of what the @FootballAssoc do, #grassroots football will never truly thrive whilst there are people like that in the game.
They think nothing of discarding 7, 8 or 9 year old kids in favour of selecting a 'win at all costs' team.
Too many junior football coaches don't coach. They just go out and get the strongest players win everything then claim all the glory #thefa
Danny Batth has taught Richard Stearman well. #wwfc
MO FARAH EATS QUORN MINCE #gerritdownya
@tube_boob @andypars @mrs_commuter gok wan!

The SMOG! The SMOG!!!!
@OldGoldGlory just donated #bonchance #goodluck
@OldGoldGlory send me the just giving details chap

@saveherefordutd if the target is promoted more widely it might encourage more to donate? I will now i know. Good luck.
@saveherefordutd it would be really helpful to see the total so far??
@toddo08 great pic
@toddo08 had one and started falling asleep standing up. The sure sign it was time to go home.
@toddo08 went in the Duke for one back in Stour- @powell_ian trying to get me locked into an evening session!!
@toddo08 it was great from any angle!! Great day mate wasn't it.
A solitary clue that Wolves were inside #wwfc 
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 and now it's all a bit scary <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><ANGUISHED FACE><FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> and sad <CONFUSED FACE><WORRIED FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> <FISHING POLE AND FISH>
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 jesus - that really is quite alarming <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 yes you really sound like someone who is high on life <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 whatever floats your boat mate!! Go and have a beer, enjoy yourself.
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 don't be a silly cunt
@MalcmacX @AnnoDomini79 zzz malcolm, zzz

@_Ade_ @bradwilko1 great pic a robinson in background with his head in hands is perfect after how he behaved at molineux #twat
@powell_ian @jdjefferies1987 there was a few royal waves from the box too
Who's this then? 

If you are going to a club tonight, be warned. 
@WolfieWestbrom @MalcmacX ha!! Did any of us discover him?! 
@toddo08 @Beds72 @Dwarfio @MartinDanks thats assuming he doesn't want to start out any earlier ffs!
@StephGeorgia @Dwarfio @Beds72 i was only dothing my cap to Russ.
@Dwarfio @StephGeorgia @Beds72 a masterclass in patience. I doth my cap to you.
@StephGeorgia @Beds72 @Dwarfio This is the funniest thing I've seen on Twitter for ages.

@RealBobMortimer claudio cannigia, the celebrated argentinian hurdler of flying cameroonians?

@LondonMidland @toddo08 @PatRussell96 such a friendly train!!! Can we call you Thomas the pisstank engine?
@toddo08 just texted ya
@PatRussell96 @toddo08 #askthedon
@toddo08 let me check with Powelly- he's like our dad on this one lol!
Is this co-commentator Robbie Dennison? #ElClasico
@Aikiwolves lol - nah that was a tag team effort! Grapple / Dead leg combo!

@Aikiwolves there was a clash of leg hairs, at most
Neymar. Cheat.   

#ElClasico
Waiting for a shot of a corner from a camera attached to the corner flag at the other end of the pitch. #ElClasico #skysports

The Man City philosophy of 'build dream team, win things' is being applied by lazy coaches right down to u7's level all over England #fa

@alanhinton11 2-0?
@TomHiggsWWFC funny dilemma though - i saw where you were coming from!
@TomHiggsWWFC did you have that bet in the end?!!
Good half, good half #wwfc
And now @GregHalford15 is flapping his arms in frustration - just like he did at Wolves #wwfc
Wait for it #nffc fans, @GregHalford15 will soon be thinking he's too good for you.
@GregHalford15 has got his 'wolves face' on. #sulk #wwfc
@Beds72 dunno how yer do it!!!!
@Beds72 still pissed then!
I can take that result tonight if I just block out the fact that John fucking Gregory had a hand in it. #wwfc
Oh #wwfc

@Gapsta1 @alexwolves @chrissyJDowner9 @tom_doyle_wwfc the thing is, I bet he has no problems spelling 'benefits'

It took a llama to change the game #england
HENDERSON WAS PLAYING?!!! #england
With any luck they'll be back home after the group stage and we can get the obligatory root &amp; branch review of English football done early.
Even Andy Townsend has started patronising them. #england
Watching England is like watching 11 delicately preened Crufts finalists trying to eat their dinner with a knife and fork. #england
England somehow devolving simple pass &amp; move to pass &amp; run away. #england

@wynny_wwfc what's the grunt he does just after?
@itv @itvfootball check out the sensible and low key commentary to Gal v Che on @SkySports 1 now. That's how you fucking do it.
Just what was Adrian Chiles doing during his post-match pitchside discussion last night? Everytime he spoke he went into spasm.
@FootballCliches paul blades
My last RT - wow.
Brentford 0 Wolves 3 #wwfc 
@OfficialWolves RAKING PASS!!! Love it.
Ssshhhhhhh
BREAKING NEWS: @itvfootball - Top Barcelona sycophant Clive Tydlesley has spontaneously oozed himself into a walking paella.
Don't ever tell a Scotsman that you're indifferent to the topic of Scottish independence.
@Beds72 @lost_stadiums and two feet of water covering the bottom two steps
@Beds72 great film Beds - Enjoy!
Parquet Courts 
Bad luck Rene. Let's hope Fulham now sink like a big steaming turd.
@TheWolvesForum well yeah, i see that. It makes no difference either way does it? It would be a like for like situation - just more room.
@AdamSyntax i'm all for standing mate but this solution seems a bit too sterile and regimented. And it has seats.
@TheWolvesForum its very safe. Almost as safe as sitting.
Looks great 
Let's face it. Safe standing = sitting with more leg room and not being told off if you happen to stand up. 
Here's your safe standing. And see how you can also sit down. Just like today. Make sure you stand in your square. 
@Beds72 then i'll have to deduct points Beds, odourless farts jut make everyone anxious
@Beds72 only if it also smelt of roast beef.
@bbc #oneshow can you ask Timothy Spall if he remembers me bumbling into him outside Malmaison in Leeds 2 years ago? He was very startled.
I'm sorry but this rail seat / safe standing just looks like Germanic standing in strict formation- with a seat. Nein discos allowed!
JAMIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD #wwfc

I haven't seen @Daybreak for a while, but it has definitely been dumbed down even further. To think that was even possible.

Brilliant to see @richardgaisford stood knee deep in flood-water again. We'd never truly get a feel for how bad the flooding is without him.
Some pubs....


Mini drivers - what's the problem?
@Joey7Barton I'm sure someone like Mick McCarthy could turn you into a half decent 'shift' player.
@stefan90wolves disappointed not to see Robbie Keane in defence

@FergusonStuart @ExpressandStar 'Bored Wolves'... It's typically crass manipulation of what has been said.
@Titchtherick1 @MSwain_star @ExpressandStar lol - not the point bud - team talks all written for remaining opponents.
@FergusonStuart @ExpressandStar team talks all written for our remaining opponents.
@MSwain_star stupid of KMac to say it, stupid of @ExpressandStar to print it. Mischievous reporting once again 
@ExpressandStar @OfficialWolves what a stupid article.
Send it to me by FedEx #SuperBowl

@davewolves1979 i can't comprehend what I'm watching.
There's actually a man who holds the water bottle to the players mouths whilst they stand there with their hands on their hips. #SuperBowl
It's just not cricket #SuperBowl
The body of Osama Bin Laden will be paraded around the pitch on top of a PEPSI branded big foot during the next time out #SuperBowl
