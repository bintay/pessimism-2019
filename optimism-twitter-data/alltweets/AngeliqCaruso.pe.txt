@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov 
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov 
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov HAHAHAH I suggest you stop. every tweet you make is just burying a deeper hole for yourself.
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov it seems to me you kinda asked for it by putting it in Twitter. Maybe you just didn't know the consequences.
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov "therefore his prents aren't te reason fr his depression even if he legitimately had it". That was ur tweet fyi
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov 
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov 
@queenmeaghxn @maddieeventov oops my bad, I guess I must have read your tweet wrong. It sounds like there is doubt? 
@maddieeventov @queenmeaghxn I read it Maddie and yes, it's definitely a two way street. One can't happen without the other.
